AN MITiNgSTORT.&#xD;
Brinkley Female College Haunted and in an Uproar of Terror and Con-&#xD;
fusion---A Speculative Apparition on the Ownership of the&#xD;
Property---Singular and Startling Revelations,&#xD;
Do disembodied spirits haunt the scenes which-they frequent-&#xD;
ed while in the-flesh ? It is a mixed. question ; the theory' that&#xD;
they do having as firm believers as it has disbelievers. Much has&#xD;
been written on the subject pro and con, and much has been said,&#xD;
but still mankind are disagreed, and can only unite in a partial&#xD;
indorsement of the words which the immortal hard of Avon put&#xD;
into the mouth of the melancholy Prince of Denmark, that lea-&#xD;
ven and earth contain more things than are conceived or dreamt&#xD;
of in our philosophy. Everybody has heard and read of ghosts,&#xD;
but we know of no one who has seen an article of that descrip-&#xD;
tion--at least we never knew of one till now. But to our story,&#xD;
which is full of strange and startling incidents---incidents so&#xD;
strange that they will scarcely be credited by the most cred-&#xD;
ulous.&#xD;
dSouth Memphis was in a furore of excitement over occurrences&#xD;
of, a supernatural nature recently made puplic, and which eon.&#xD;
ceened the Brinkley Female College, and its inmates._&#xD;
.fhe college is a spacious frame structure, with rather a&#xD;
sornbre and dreary aspect; situated at or near the inter-&#xD;
section of Georgia and ieSoto streets. It was once a palatial&#xD;
residence, or intended as such. but for several years past has been&#xD;
used as a school for young ladies. under the direction of Mr. Me'r-&#xD;
ideth, the'building having been devoted to that purpose by Mr.&#xD;
R. C. Brinkley, its reputed owner,  It is said to have ruined its&#xD;
builder and original owner, and the place has borne the reputa-&#xD;
tion of being haunted for some time, but as this, was never in any&#xD;
way.satisfactorily accounted for, the suggeston of its. being the&#xD;
habitation of things unearthly was dismissed as growing simply&#xD;
out of the isolated situation and weird aspect of the structure, to&#xD;
which may be added surroundings, which strike the visitor as&#xD;
decidedly unattractive. If there be ghosts of the departed&#xD;
on earth, it isiust such a place as such things would select for a&#xD;
trysting or abiding place, or rather it is just such a looking place&#xD;
as one would be inclined to associate with spirits and things su-&#xD;
pernatural.&#xD;
The school numbered beteveen forty and fifty pupils of various'&#xD;
ages, and of teachers, including the principle and his wife, there&#xD;
were some six or seven. The system of education was about as&#xD;
usually found in institutions oi4its class and the full course in-&#xD;
clude music and the classics. Many of the pupils came from afar&#xD;
anl were boardors.at the institute, but not a few who reside in&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
the &amp;amp;tv, and near the college, were but day attendants. Among&#xD;
the latter was a Miss Clara Robertson, daughter of Mr. Robert-&#xD;
son, ai attorney, residing on )eSoto street, between Vance and&#xD;
Elliot streets, Her age is about thirteen years, and her temper!-&#xD;
ment is of the nervous kind, while her health is rather whrt might&#xD;
be called delicate. Some eight months ago she experienceI r'lig-&#xD;
ion, and has ever since been a model of strict religious propriety,&#xD;
She has never been in any way connected with things supernat-&#xD;
ural or put trust in spiritualists. Her experience with affairs&#xD;
claimed to be supernatural within the last two weeks, however,&#xD;
are more wonderful and startling than the Mysteries of Jdolpho&#xD;
or the horrors of Kenilworth Castle,&#xD;
One evening, Miss Clara was alone in one of the upper rooms&#xD;
of the institution practicing her music lesson ; an apparition&#xD;
suddenly appeared before her in the shape of a girl about eight&#xD;
years of age, with sunken, lustreless eyes and strkingly emacia-&#xD;
ted form and features. The object was virtually a skeleton in&#xD;
appearance, clad in a. dingy and tattered dress of faded pink,&#xD;
which was partly covered with a greenish and slimy mould.  It&#xD;
seemed also to be transparent. A sad e pression re ted on the&#xD;
features of the strange visitor. Natural y frightened,  ran&#xD;
into an adjacent room and sprang into bed with a sick girl, at the&#xD;
same time motioning with her hand to the unsightly object to be-&#xD;
gone. The apparition advanded, however, with slow and noise-&#xD;
loss steps to the bedside, and laid an emaciated hand on the pil-&#xD;
low, while Clara, aghast and speechless with terror, was nearly&#xD;
thrown into spasms, but all the time motioned away the object,&#xD;
which finally disappeared through aside door, as noiselessly as it&#xD;
had entered. The affrighted girl told her adventure, and it at&#xD;
once became the all-absorbing topic of conversation, throughout&#xD;
the school meeting with belief, disbelief and ridicule,- The ma-&#xD;
jority were more or less frightened over the strange tale unfolded.&#xD;
but songe few made so much fun of it as to mortify Clara to tears.&#xD;
She told her teacher and parents, but not only failed in obtain-&#xD;
ing their belief but was reprimanded, her father telling her it&#xD;
was only a trick put upon her by some of the girls, and ordering&#xD;
her to return to school the-next day, which order she obeyed&#xD;
with reluctance and trembling.&#xD;
The apparition did not appear next day, and Clara's tranquil-&#xD;
ity of mind was about restored. Perhaps, after all, it was only a&#xD;
trick.. On Thursday, however, while pracicing upon the pianp in&#xD;
the same room, two other young ladies being present, she was&#xD;
startled by an unusual noise as if by some water being dashed&#xD;
over the floor, and on turning her head ip the direction of- the&#xD;
sound, was dismayed by the appearance of the same spectral&#xD;
looking visitor of two days before. . It was seen by all three,&#xD;
more distinctly by Clara than the others, and the trio fled in ter-&#xD;
ror from the presence of the fearful apparition, ghost, goblin or&#xD;
whatever it might be. The story was again told, and was, ridi-&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7604-00000003"/>&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
culed as nonsensical, as in the first instance, notwithstanding the&#xD;
testimony of the young ladies who were in the room with Miss&#xD;
Clara, to whom, however, the figure appeared rather shadowy,&#xD;
though to their friend it was well defined and distinct.&#xD;
On Tuesday the ghost appeared at the same place, and un-&#xD;
der like circumstances.. Miss Clara ran down:jhe steps in great af-&#xD;
fright and trepibling like an aspen, related the occurrence to Miss&#xD;
Jackey Boone, one of the teachers, who induced the girl to return&#xD;
with her to the music room. As they opened the door, the figure&#xD;
stood plainly to view to Clara, but only imperfectly in the ' eyes&#xD;
of Miss Boone. Induced to! address her strange visitor, Clara&#xD;
asked what it was doing there, and what it wanted.  Pointing a'&#xD;
thin ghastly looking finger in a southerly direction, the ghost&#xD;
replied that under a stump, some fifty yards from the house.&#xD;
were secreted some valuables which she would have Miss Clara&#xD;
take possession of, and use to her advantage. Miss Boone heard&#xD;
a rumbling noise, but could not distinguish any words, but a&#xD;
pupil,present at the time relates that words similar to those heard&#xD;
by Miss Clara, were distinct to her ears also.&#xD;
Having spoke as above, the object vanished through the garret&#xD;
door as on each former occasion. i Dismay now prevailed thropgh-&#xD;
out the institute, and there were none to ridicule or question.&#xD;
Clara Robertson related the full particulars to her father&#xD;
when she went hoie on Tuesday night, wh( next day visited the&#xD;
college and had a consultation with Mr. and Mrs. Meredeth about.&#xD;
the-matter. It was agreeed that the affair should undergo a&#xD;
rigid investigation, as it was doing no good to the reputation of&#xD;
the college, while little ClaY-a was much troubled and disturbed&#xD;
in mind.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Meredith believing they were being duped by&#xD;
some practical joker, undertook to invistigate the matter.  With&#xD;
this object inview, they on Thursday had every pupil of the col-&#xD;
lege assembled in one of the halls. Miss Clara was sent into thi',&#xD;
yard while the remaining scholars were being questioned and&#xD;
ex: miied. She walked quietly around the house, and, while&#xD;
engaged in pointing a pencil some fifty yards from the building,&#xD;
the apparition suddenly appeared before het, not rore than half a&#xD;
dozen feet away. She'attemptedto scream, but the visitor spoke&#xD;
quickly, in a mild, pleasant tone, and said. " Don't be alarmed.&#xD;
Clara, my name is Lizzie.  I 'gill not hurt you."  Clara stood&#xD;
transfixed with terror. The vision spoke again and in a distinct&#xD;
tone related that theBrinkley college property was hers byoright,&#xD;
title, and, that its present pretended owners held it illegally,&#xD;
having no shadow of a claim whatever.  That there was no one&#xD;
else to claim it, as he' people were all deed, and she herself was&#xD;
the last one that had died; She desired Clara to obtain the papers&#xD;
which she had previously mentioned to her, and with then in her&#xD;
possession, claim and yiet tin -the property-in her own name and .&#xD;
right. Unless she did Eo, it never would do any-good to or for any&#xD;
&#xD;
one. Of course this soon spread among the usually quiet people&#xD;
of South Memphis. Several young ladies went home frightened&#xD;
out of their wits and several were affected with illness. ,Some,&#xD;
it was feared, seriously. Clara was naturally more excited over&#xD;
the singular event than others, remained athome last Friday to&#xD;
compose her mind, but she was told by her father that on Mon-&#xD;
day she must be prepared ito return tol school She replied that&#xD;
she would rather die than to go there again. Of course her father&#xD;
was interested in thesesitrange, and to him unaccountable fancies&#xD;
of his daughter. Having some legal business at his office with&#xD;
an. old lady who was reported to be a spiritual medium, he related&#xD;
the story to her. She replied that she would, if permitted to&#xD;
visit the child, and see .if anything could be made out of it,&#xD;
Monday evening, when Mr. Robertson went home from    his&#xD;
business office, the spiritual medium accompanied him. Shortly&#xD;
after she entered the'room where Clara, was, and a table was set&#xD;
before her. Several neighbors dropped in to witness the expected&#xD;
developments. All seated themselves around the table, placing&#xD;
their hands on the surface.. Mr. Robertson, always skeptical and&#xD;
doubting the truth of the r tory, watched with the eyes of a hawk&#xD;
to detect fraud or collusion. His doubting mind, with that of&#xD;
several others, who had during their natural existence ridiculed&#xD;
ghosts and spirits, was soon awe and wojider struck at the strange&#xD;
actions that followed. The little girl, to all appearances, swooned,&#xD;
falling back into her chair apparently lifeless, and certainly in-&#xD;
sensible.  Her eyes   stood  wide open, fixed on vacanOy.&#xD;
Her hands began to' move, Sqon they moved faster, and in a&#xD;
short time their violent action frightened the parent, who caught&#xD;
hold of his child's arm to prevent doing herself harm,  Those&#xD;
bresent (some dozen or more) were amazed at the child's behav-&#xD;
ior and ap peatrance. In due time they became tranquil, as did&#xD;
the hand of Miss Clara, though not in the latter case until all the&#xD;
skin had been barke(d fronmthe knuckles of her hands, She never&#xD;
spoke a word, but when the medium placed a pencil in her hands&#xD;
and paper on the table beneath it, she began to write with aston-&#xD;
ishing velocity, At first the characters were-strange, indistinct,&#xD;
and unreadable.   Gradually .the scratches assumed shape and&#xD;
form, and finally became readable.  Sentences were read, from&#xD;
the several sheets the girl wrote upon which corroborated all she&#xD;
had previously related. Questions were asked by persons present&#xD;
and replies were instantly written on the paper, the writer never&#xD;
uttering a word, and all-the time totally insenseible.  The same&#xD;
as has:been told was all written in words clear and distinct. The&#xD;
question was asked under what stump the valuabks were buried.&#xD;
The reply was, five feet under the one upon which the vision had&#xD;
stood. - The question Was asked, why it was desired that Clara&#xD;
should become the possessor ofthe property?  The reply was:&#xD;
'Because by recognizing the vision she had become relieved of a&#xD;
trouble that had long weighed upon her.. Her spirit was now&#xD;

&#xD;
free and as other parties were then searching diligently for the&#xD;
secreted papers, unless they were ressurrected without delay they&#xD;
would fall into improper hands, and become worthless to all ex-&#xD;
eept the illegal holders of the place. The question was asked,&#xD;
"suppose those now in possession refuse to release their hold ?"&#xD;
The answer was writtenp;I will see that it shall do them no good&#xD;
if you only. recover the papers.''  Other sentences were written&#xD;
which, we think it imprudent to publish, but having the paper&#xD;
upon which the girl wrote in our possession, in the editorial rooms&#xD;
of the Avalanche, they can be produced as occular proof of the&#xD;
correctness of that part of the story to whichthey relate,  The&#xD;
medium wrote that the name of the spirit was Lizzie Davidson&#xD;
and closed by inditing the sentence,"good night, kiss Clara, for&#xD;
I love her."  Thereupon the female medium bestowed the kiss as&#xD;
reqnested. Miss Clara immediately raised up, rubbed her eyes,&#xD;
said she-had been asleep and- dreaming, and was utterly uncon-&#xD;
scious of the strange proceedings that had been .enacted or that&#xD;
she had done things that had so completely dumbfounded, bewil-&#xD;
dered and astonished the persons present. The result of the af-&#xD;
fair was that at about 9 o'clock at night a pa ty of, four or five&#xD;
gentlemen repaired to the college grounds, where they found ev-&#xD;
ery inmate a firm believer in the story of the vision.  The gen-&#xD;
tlemen after consultation, detirmined to exctvate the stump. to see&#xD;
if the promised secret valuables could be utnd.&#xD;
CHAPTER IfL&#xD;
The scenes narrated in previous chapter caused hundreds to&#xD;
visit the grounds and gratify their curiosity as far as practicable,&#xD;
in peering into the excavation and watching the diggers as they&#xD;
toiled patiently in search 6f the supposed hidden treasures, which,&#xD;
as revealed through spiritual agencies at the residence of Mr.&#xD;
lobertson, on DeSoto Street, Saturday night, consisted of several&#xD;
thousand dollars in coin, a quantity of jewelry, including valuable&#xD;
diamonds, and the title papers of the estate. Oonspicuous among&#xD;
the visitors were groups of fishionably-dressed ladies,wyho seemed&#xD;
to take an acute interest-in all that was said and done in connec-&#xD;
tion with the marvelous occurrences, and even more adventurous&#xD;
than t/he male sex in pressing. forward and endeavoring to un-&#xD;
tathom the mystery, prompted, no doubt by a kindred spirit to&#xD;
that which prompts them to be the most active and officious alike&#xD;
at funerals and weddings. The edloired population, among whom&#xD;
the story had spread in all sorts of ways, was largely represented&#xD;
and stood by with blank faces, on which were to be read unmis&#xD;
takeably the deepest superstition and concern.&#xD;
An Avalanche reporter interviewed Mr.' Meredeth on Sunday,'&#xD;
relative to the case of Miss Robertson, and learned from that gen-&#xD;
tleman that, while he had no doubt that she was-honest in her state-&#xD;
ments, it was his firm belief that the alleged visitations were sim-&#xD;
&#xD;
ply mental hallucinations arising from abberration of the mind.&#xD;
In conclusion, Mr. Meredeth, who is principal of the college, in-&#xD;
timated that the girl had no doubt gone crazy, and expressed his&#xD;
regret that his school 'was likely to suffer in consequence-would&#xD;
be broken up perhaps-so great was the. excitement among the&#xD;
students and in the neighborhood. -He did not question that&#xD;
Clara saw strange visions, but said they were certainly in her mind's&#xD;
eye, and insisted, statementsfrom other sources to the contrary,&#xD;
that the unearthly visions had been seen by no one else on the&#xD;
premises. Once, when Clara was' in, the music room  with two&#xD;
other pupils of the institute, she called their attention to the appa-&#xD;
rition. which had suddenly appeared before her, and in their&#xD;
fright they thought they saw it also, and ran away, but after col-&#xD;
lecting their sens=,s they became doubtful and finally concluded&#xD;
that they saw nothing but a .creation in their own  fancy.  Of'&#xD;
Clara's character, general dportment and truthfulness, he spoke&#xD;
in the highest terms ; there was not a better girl in the school, he&#xD;
said, and the trouble which had take possession of her within&#xD;
the past two weekswas as unaccountable as it was to be regretted.&#xD;
So far as ghosts or hobgoblins are concerned, he looked upon talk&#xD;
of that kiridas mere bosh. and the same. he asserted, was the pre-&#xD;
vailing sentiment among the teachers and pupils of the in-&#xD;
stittute over which he presided. and which of late had, in connec-&#xD;
tion with the affair under consideration, become so unpleasantly&#xD;
notorious. le was informed on taking possession of the place&#xD;
that it had the reputation of being haunted, atid duri ig the first&#xD;
several months of'his residence had heard strange noises of nights,&#xD;
which caused much alarm among his family, and were finally&#xD;
traced to an object in the shape of a~ raccoon, which one night&#xD;
walked slowly around the dining room and disappearing through&#xD;
the door in the darkness. was not seen again for sonme time, when&#xD;
it was chased into the kitchen, and there enned while he (M r. M,)&#xD;
went around to a side eutrance with a view of capturing the in-&#xD;
truder. On entering the kitchen by the side entrance spoken of,&#xD;
Mr. M. found that'the animal had disappeared under the hearth&#xD;
and made its escape. it was not seen again until one night the&#xD;
faniily were sitting up with the corpse of an infant son of M. Mere-&#xD;
deth, when it suddenly appeared in the room, a reception room,&#xD;
and after looking at the corpse of the child a moment, as suddenly&#xD;
disappeared through an open doorway. It was never seen again,&#xD;
and since that night the:tinware and crockery of the establish-&#xD;
ment have rattled -and ,lattered only when in use.&#xD;
Same reporter interviewed Mr Robertson, the father of Clara,&#xD;
'at his residence on DeSoto;street-, between Vance and Elliot streets,&#xD;
and was pleasantly received by that gentleman. Mr. R. is an hon-&#xD;
est looking gentleman of forty years or thereabouts, is possessed of&#xD;
a good share of intelligence, is well known as a practicing lawyer,&#xD;

rencessat Brinkley Collage, Mr. Robertson said he 'had no theory&#xD;
whatever ; that there was no doubt of the truthflulness.of his child;&#xD;
and that, skeptic as he had always been as to things supernatural,&#xD;
and disinclned to believe Clara's statement at forest, he had finally;&#xD;
come to the conclusion that there was some mystery connected with'&#xD;
the affair, which, from the alleged repeated visitations, and the cor-&#xD;
roborative evidence elicit=;d during the seances at his residence the&#xD;
night before, together with what followed at the college grounds,&#xD;
as stated in thi Avalanche of Sunday, he felt it to be his duty to&#xD;
investigate. - The' following conversation ensued :&#xD;
Reporter.--Mr. Robertson, where is Clara ? Mr. R.-She has&#xD;
gone to Sunday school..&#xD;
Reporter.-Is she in good health?  Mr. R -Yes sir; in excel-&#xD;
lent health for one of her delicate organization. She is 'of a rather&#xD;
a nervous temperament, and is somewhat acute in her .sensibilities&#xD;
but her health nas.always been good.                     .&#xD;
Reporter. Is she subject to religious excitement or sensation-&#xD;
alism ? Mr. R.No sir. She joined the church some months ago,&#xD;
but has never displayed more than ordinary interest in religious&#xD;
matters. -&#xD;
Rep -Does she believe in Spiritnalis n, or has she ever been pres-&#xD;
ent at, or in any way conn 'cted with spiritual manifestations?&#xD;
Mr, R.-No, sir ; she does 'not, and never had anythingto do with&#xD;
spiritual manifestations until last night.&#xD;
Reporter -Was Clara ever frightened by ghost stories, or is she&#xD;
in the habit of reading them ? M-. R.--N), :r. .&#xD;
'Reporter.-You hlieve all she has state conaerning these al-&#xD;
leg~d visitations? Mr. R.-I have implicit confidence in her truth-&#xD;
In iness.&#xD;
Reporter.-Is there  any litigation concerning the Brinkley&#xD;
College property ? Mr. R.-No, sir ; none that I have ever heard&#xD;
of.&#xD;
Reporter.-Has Clara ever heard stories of concealed treasure,&#xD;
or that there is any dispute as to the ownership of the property?&#xD;
Mr. R.-Never except what was- revealed to her by the apparition.&#xD;
Reporter.-Do you or any of your family-believe in spiritual-&#xD;
ism ? Mr. R.-No, sir. On the contrary, we have always been&#xD;
skeptics on that subject.               . .--&#xD;
Reporter.-Have you any legal or other 'relations with Mr.&#xD;
Brinkley, or any one laying claim to the Brinkley College property ?&#xD;
Mr. R.-No, sir.&#xD;
Reporter.-Do you consider your daughter sane ? Mr. R -&#xD;
Perfectly so; she has never exhibited the slightest symptoms of in-&#xD;
sanity, and seems to be affected only on the subject of these visi-&#xD;
tations. In all respects she is as mentally sound as any child of her&#xD;
age.&#xD;
Reporter.-Is she frightened about this thing? Mr. R.-Only&#xD;
when she sees the apparition, which she says is most unsightly,&#xD;
Reporter.-Han she ever seen appar tions before this one?  Mr.&#xD;
R.-N ever, sir.&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
Reporter.-Is she inclined to return to the school ?  Mr. R.-&#xD;
No, sir; she declares she would rather die.&#xD;
Rleporter.-Do you intend to compel her to return ? Mr. R.-&#xD;
No, sir. At first I'made her go, bat I have come to the conclu-&#xD;
sion to let her return of her own free will, or in ferreting out the&#xD;
mystery.&#xD;
Reporter.-Well sir,what do you think of those alleged jvisita-&#xD;
tations ? Mr.R.-I don't know what to think; 'I am  bewildered&#xD;
and mystified.&#xD;
Hereupon the reporter of the Avalanche withdrew, with an in-&#xD;
vitation to fall again, and the assurance of Mr. R. that he would&#xD;
give him all the information in his possession from time to time&#xD;
concerning the singular occurrences under consideration.&#xD;
Under the pale ghostly light of the moon Sunday night, the&#xD;
work of digging for the secret was resumed and carried on ji&#xD;
the presence of a motley and constantly changing group, some&#xD;
jeering and others encourageing the work.  Tom.Burns, clerk&#xD;
-in the office of R. W. Li htburne on Front street, sat on the&#xD;
,dge of the excavation directinfi'proceedings. Nothing was de-&#xD;
veloped beyond the existence of some masonry work in the shape&#xD;
of an arch, which extended under the stump, and which was partly&#xD;
demolished by the spades and picks of the workmen, and during&#xD;
the small hours was abandoned. It was resumed yesterday,&#xD;
when the stump was finally removed, displaying-more brick work,&#xD;
but not the hidden treasure.&#xD;
During Sunday Clara remained undisturbed by ghostly visi-&#xD;
visitants, and, although extenseively interviewed, managed to at-&#xD;
tend Sunday school in the morning and-church in the evening,&#xD;
attended to the latter place by Mr. Franklin, a neighbor.  Of&#xD;
course she was -the observed of all observers, and expressed some&#xD;
annoyance thereat. She passed 'a quiet night and was quite&#xD;
cheerful next day, though thinking frequently of the occurrences&#xD;
of the past few days. While in the back yard of her residence,&#xD;
No. 261 DeSoto street, however, in company with a young friend,&#xD;
about 9 o'clock, she was'startled by the sudden appearance of&#xD;
the spectre of Brinkley College, and, screaming, directed to it&#xD;
the attention of her companion, who ran away in affright, though&#xD;
she saw nothing. The spectre, like the ghost of Hamlet, chided&#xD;
Clara for her tardiness in unearthing the secret, and answered&#xD;
that it could not be found, when it rejoined that Clara must go&#xD;
and seek it herself, or the others would get it. The spectre then&#xD;
disappeared, and Clara ran in trepidation into the house, w here&#xD;
narrated her adventure, It was resolved by the inmates to pro-&#xD;
eed at once to the excavation, which they did, Clara going with&#xD;
Miss Franklsn, a neighbor.  The diggers were still at. work.&#xD;
Clara was urged to call uponl the spirit again, which, after much&#xD;
hesitation, she did. it appeared to her eyes alone, and indicated&#xD;
with its finger more exactly the direction in which' the excava-&#xD;
tion should be made, saying at the same time that Clara herself&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
must dig. .In great affright, Clar~a finally stepped tnto the exca-&#xD;
vation and proceeded with herslittle 'hands to ply the spade. She&#xD;
turned one -spade full of dirt, stepped forward aaif to pick some-&#xD;
thing up and fell insensible. :Carried into the house she was&#xD;
restored, when she declared shehad sepn the jar, and was about&#xD;
to pick it up when she fell. Excitement ran higher than pver.&#xD;
Consequent upop this occurrence, another seance was held by&#xD;
Mrs. Nourse, tpe; medium, at Ar. Robertson's house, when th."&#xD;
spectre % as invoked to communicate through Clara. -A spirit&#xD;
calling herself Gora angversed, saying she was a cousin of Lizzie&#xD;
Davie,.who --as not then. present. But at last the spirit of Lizzie&#xD;
Davie was raised, and .upo being questioned, said that Clara&#xD;
must dig for the treasure. The spirit was told that. Clara was in&#xD;
too nervousand;excited a condition,,and asked if M.' R., could&#xD;
not seek a  obtrin ii, to which it answered, after some hesita-&#xD;
tion, in the affirmative, saying, lxon ever, that in that event, the&#xD;
jar 8s1ould not be opened for sixty days. It also indicated the ex-&#xD;
act spot n the excavation, and spid the jar would be found under&#xD;
the arch. Mr. Robertson, accompanied' by the ,n ediun and two&#xD;
diggers, and following the direction of the spirit, to,mal, e a long&#xD;
stiQry short, after digging an :hour or more into the brick work,&#xD;
found a glass jar, which h}e, quietly passed up to the medium,&#xD;
whereupon they proceeded to Mr. B's. residence followed by an&#xD;
excited crowd, The jar was at pnce delivered to Clara, who, re-&#xD;
garding its possession as an end to her unearthly visitations,&#xD;
received it with transports ofi delight, and up to a late hour was&#xD;
in the happiest mode imaginable.&#xD;
The jar bore evidence of lung concealment, being covered&#xD;
with mould. -True to their instrutions from the spirit, it was&#xD;
not opened, but through its sides could be seen several bags and&#xD;
packages, together with what appeared to be a large yellow en-&#xD;
velope.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
SPECTRE OP BaINKLEY COLLEGE.&#xD;
How about that ghost? was the question which the man about&#xD;
town encountered. now at every turn ; and that jar, did you see it?&#xD;
What was it like?. Was it a family jar? Was there any whisky&#xD;
init ? All day long, and all through the night "the ghost" "was&#xD;
talked of wherever one chanced to go, and "ghost" with a spoon in&#xD;
it was the favorite beverage in every bar room. steamboats went&#xD;
out of port' with spectral shadows about -ahem, and men as they&#xD;
walked through the streets last night, dodged at every alley or open&#xD;
doorway, while children cried in terror if left for a moment alone.&#xD;
Groups discussed the marvelous occurrences at almost every corner&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
of the street, and various Nhreetbe theories suigested, and wonder-&#xD;
fll the experiences related:. On theory concerning the alleged find-&#xD;
ing of"the glass jar, was that Mi'. Robertson was simply playing a&#xD;
cute little game on his daughter Clara, with the hope that the pre-&#xD;
tended finding of sdmethiti of the kind indicated would have the&#xD;
effet of restoring her to hirfenses, aridin this connection the mat-&#xD;
terf f4si ty days " was ehi didt ith the idea that'that Was simply&#xD;
to give the child time to recover from the depression and nervous-&#xD;
nesshnperindiced by the bot'ly visRationi 'of the' past two weeks.&#xD;
But against this'it was t rbd thAt it Nasd  nairnecessary proceeding&#xD;
on the part' of Mr. R. to '6iin the dead' of night, in company with&#xD;
the wied woman; and twd dih~4rs as dark'as Erebus, to dig for the&#xD;
secretin the presence of lar's crowd:6f'"people, when a glass jar,&#xD;
brought sealed from s,otne corner '\oery would have answered the&#xD;
purpose as well, so far  s 'anyknowledge Clara could possibly have&#xD;
is concerned. Mr. Rohertson, howev r,1 regardless of all theories&#xD;
an(d fancies. avows mdst sacredly that the jar was found by him in&#xD;
the excavation, and itmay have been there since the' deluge, for all&#xD;
he knows to theicontrary.' He bad but one 6plnion on the subject,&#xD;
he said, and.that hodid not'voiunteer to 'express. The possibility&#xD;
of some "jolly fellows " h avingplaced the jarinthe excavation for&#xD;
hint to find, he would not entertain for a imorent. He found it, he&#xD;
said,, under the instructions received at-the seance on Mnday night,&#xD;
and is satisfied. Besides, if he would deceive his child, where is&#xD;
the necessity of also deeiving the-publie? The jar found by Mr.&#xD;
Robertson, was about twelve inches in hight by ten in diameter, and&#xD;
of thin glass, such as is commonly used by druggists and conec'&#xD;
tioners. . The top is sealed closely, and the weight of the whole is&#xD;
about six pounds. It was deposited in a place of safety known only&#xD;
to Mr. Robertson and his daughter. ~"Its possession. apparently&#xD;
relieved the child, of all supernatural influences, and she is now as&#xD;
happy as a clam in high water'; in the belief that her troubles are&#xD;
ended. The age and evident innocence of the child disarm every-&#xD;
body of suspicion that she 'is the 'tool of designing persons, -and&#xD;
nearly everybody inclines to the belief that' she has had visions' of&#xD;
the mind's eye if not in reality. Her deep earnestne-s, truthful-&#xD;
ness and piety are spoken of by all to whom she is known, and&#xD;
With none does she stand in higher esteem than the inmates and hab-&#xD;
itues of Brinkley College.&#xD;
The spectre, as described by Clara, was unsightly and terrible&#xD;
It was in the form of a child of eight or nine years of age, dressed&#xD;
in faded pink, covered with a slimy greenish mold, which seemed&#xD;
to speak of the tenements of the dead. It wore also rusty shoes&#xD;
with mildewed stockings.- The head, neck, arms and such portions&#xD;
of -the form as were exposed to Clara's view, seemed to be of trans-&#xD;
parent skin encasing bones and sinews entirely fleshless. In speech&#xD;
it was always mild and gentle, with at times a touch of earnest per-&#xD;
suasion. It gave the name of Lizzie Davie, in writing, on two&#xD;
occasions. It is singular, to say the least, that a child of that name&#xD;

was once an inmate of the building, and died there in 1861. So we&#xD;
are informed by old citizens, one of whom, a prominent cotton&#xD;
operator, claims to have recollection of much talk some years ago&#xD;
concerning the title to the estate.&#xD;
It is impossible to:convey more than a faint idea of the sensa-&#xD;
tiop created by this singular affair since the first publication, which,&#xD;
brog ht forth the following letter to the Avaldnche, dated April&#xD;
EDITOR AVALA;N   :-W your issue of Sunday, the 5th inst., I&#xD;
noticed an unwvarrented use of ny-name in connection with the Brink -&#xD;
ey Female College ghost story., I write this to correct the mis-&#xD;
ake made in the statement:that I have at any time seen even the&#xD;
shadow of a ghost, or heard any unaccountable sound about our&#xD;
usually quiet college. Miss 1obertson at one time came into the&#xD;
music room, apparently very nuch excited, but having never&#xD;
given credit to the story of tho ghost, I neither went back with her&#xD;
to her practice room or sent any one else; and-the only wish tnat&#xD;
I have heard expressed by the pupils of the Brinkley College, is&#xD;
that the citizens of Memphis would stay at home and allow us to go&#xD;
on quietly with our owe affairs and not undermine us.&#xD;
We do not believe in ghosts, and as the statemrrent limited our&#xD;
number of pupils to fifty,,I think I can safely say that forty nine&#xD;
out of the fifty are disbelievers,&#xD;
JACKIE BOONE.&#xD;
Mr. Meredith's letter which, like Miss Boone'si was written&#xD;
t before the finding of the glass jar,,is as follows:&#xD;
BaNKLEY COLLEGE, March 5, 1871.&#xD;
DEAR AVALANCHE ;---Please let me speak for myself about&#xD;
" ghosts."  I have lived in this college two and a half years, and&#xD;
have seen noghosts worse than a " lien " creditor from time to time&#xD;
--nor is there an "inmate !" of this house who has seen or beard&#xD;
anything strange-except what-we have learned from persons out-&#xD;
side of our lot, and from your " visionary'" reporters. Miss Rob-.&#xD;
ertson, who lives in the city, did see "sights " here, and she can see&#xD;
them anywhere ; for she takes her ghosts with her, and I leave&#xD;
medical men to dispose of her ense scientifically. A "spirit " in&#xD;
the city ordered a stump to be dug up in our garden, which vas&#xD;
badly " done up " this morning by " enterprising " men.. I do not&#xD;
believe in ghosts, mediums or anything -the devil can get up-&#xD;
though getting up stumps is rather uncommon for him. But, gen-&#xD;
tlemen, this rumor is well calculated to injure a college, which hy&#xD;
many enemies, simply because it has low prices-because it believes&#xD;
the Bible should be the first and, last text book in every ,pupil's&#xD;
hand; and hence we hope that every newspaper in the city, to which&#xD;
we are indebted, will follow their noble impulses, and send our bills&#xD;
receiptedd, to indemnify us for this late "unpleasantness."&#xD;
Your obedient servant.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
The above correspondence elicited the following from Mr J. R.&#xD;
Robertson:&#xD;
To TUBEnTos or OTE Arrt* :-Aliow me, through the col-&#xD;
umns of your excellent paper, to reply to tle knowing correspon-&#xD;
dent who occupies so much of your valuable space in this morning's&#xD;
paper, over no signaturO, but indorsed by you as a gentleman of&#xD;
integrity, etc., and state in the outset that- almost every word, at&#xD;
least every proposition, in said communication, so far as the same&#xD;
relates to my little daughter, Clara, who, I regret, is unfortunately&#xD;
prominently connected with the,;" Brinkley College -Ghost " story, it&#xD;
utterly false and unfounded in trath. I, hpwever, do not say that&#xD;
your correspondens is the origi ator of those falsehoods, or that he&#xD;
has wantonly or maliciously, perpetrated them, and before I shall&#xD;
have done with this articleoI willigiye him a full and fair opportu-&#xD;
nity to make good the many statertbents made by him.&#xD;
He starts'out by saying: "II believe there is an abnormal con-&#xD;
dition of the system at the bottom of it.", In reply to this I would&#xD;
:Aimply ask Mr. Anonymous, who are you? what are you? (ron&#xD;
whence came you and whither are you tending ? Are you a disci&#xD;
ple of Erriascopilus, and hve you gone down into the depths. of&#xD;
physical science so as to enable you to fotmin, mature and deliver an&#xD;
opinion as to the physical condition of a patient whom you have&#xD;
never seen, much less examined? or have you read Dr. Gunn's&#xD;
work or Thompson's treatiseof Lobelia and Wake Robbin? Who&#xD;
are yon ? Answer, that the public may know whether or not the&#xD;
voluntary opinion you so freely offer is worty of reliance.&#xD;
You also say that this little girl attended Dr. Earle's revival and&#xD;
got religion, etc. This is not so. Long before Dr. Earle came&#xD;
here she was a member of the M. E. Church,'at Asbury Chapel, as&#xD;
is known to that whole congregation, and especially to the excellent&#xD;
pastor of that church, Rev. L. D. Mullins. and I refer to himuand&#xD;
to every member. of the church , that.she has at no time since her&#xD;
connection with it manifested any unusual interest on the subject ;&#xD;
.simply attendidg the regular meetings of the church in the still,&#xD;
calm and dignified way characteristic of her deportment in all the&#xD;
varied walks of life.&#xD;
You say for one whole month slhe had been seeing ghosts and&#xD;
refusing to sleep alone, etc.&#xD;
How in the name of allithat is sacred did you get into the pri-&#xD;
vate affairs of my family? Have 3 ou secreted yourself in some&#xD;
private corner and watched, like the ghost of Hamlet, the movements&#xD;
of my children when they are retiring to their beds'of straw; or have&#xD;
you, like the Witch of Endpr, sprung up in the midst of the family&#xD;
circle and taken notes of what you say is true? Surely, this is- news&#xD;
to us. . We now learn for the first time that Clara had ever seen or&#xD;
heard anything like a ghost until some three weeks since, which was&#xD;
the commencement of the wonderful development at Brinkley&#xD;
College.&#xD;

Yon say that she saw the ghbst  6f Peabody, who told her that&#xD;
be, with his great heart of hearts, was going to endow Brinkley&#xD;
College with $25,000, visions ofilyde Park and the little florid man,&#xD;
etc., all of which is, no doubt. the fruitful imaginations of 'the won-&#xD;
derful productiv'e bt in of ,the Lobelia Doctor. It is utt rly false.&#xD;
No such'thing has 'ev  occurred; as Clara herself, who never speaks&#xD;
at random,'will fully' attest'; 'and as tothe 'medical- prescription of&#xD;

no such secrets in 'our family. 'And''now to the queries which I pro-&#xD;
pose to abSwer categorically asinear as I am' able&#xD;
Q. Was not. that peach preserve jar bought at Jack's china&#xD;
store at 9 o'clock Monday morning.&#xD;
A. I-I do not know.&#xD;
Q. Did not the colored woman who was sent'for, the jar 'get -an&#xD;
old one dollar bill with a rent in it topay fur the jar.&#xD;
A. I do not know ; but will state that I have no colored woman&#xD;
at my place or under my control, nor havc I had since last fall.&#xD;
Q. Was it not fixed up at twelve o'clock onMonday, in a 'er-&#xD;
tain back parlor, and was not the sealing-wax purchased at Young's&#xD;
bankrupt sale.&#xD;
A. We have no back parlor, and neither myself nor any person&#xD;
for me has bought anything at Young's sale, except some paper and&#xD;
envelopes presented to me by a friend.&#xD;
Q. 'Does not the jar as it now is weigh about two pounds avor-&#xD;
dupois.&#xD;
A. I have not weighed it.&#xD;
Q. Is there not a package of No. Z shot in it.&#xD;
A. I cannot tell, not having seen the contents except through&#xD;
the jar's coverings.&#xD;
Q. Are not the papers composed of the following documents :&#xD;
five, blank forms for attachments, three sheets legal cap, upon which&#xD;
is written an old, ease in the Chancery Court, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
15,&#xD;
&#xD;
A. No such things are visible .througla the jar. The, papers&#xD;
appear to be old printed niatter, and a yellow envelope well nigh&#xD;
decayed,&#xD;
Q. Did not Mrs. course carry t liat jar down to the hole under&#xD;
her, cloak.&#xD;
A. She did not.. She had no cloak,; simply a light shawl over&#xD;
her head and shoulders,. I was with her from the time she started&#xD;
until the jar was found, and f she had had the jar, I could and would&#xD;
have seen it.&#xD;
Q. Were not the colored excavators instructed to say that, they&#xD;
saw the jar while they were digging. - lhat it, moved away from them&#xD;
and then they jumped out of the hole in apparent affright.&#xD;
A. No.; after the jar was fond one of the negroes said that&#xD;
while he was digging on Sunday niglt he saw the same jar, but&#xD;
failed to get it.&#xD;
Q. Did not the program me, whatever was the object of it,&#xD;
include the moving the crowd -way from the hole, while the previ-&#xD;
ously appointed finder should go in and get it.&#xD;
A. -No; tnor was there any program, of which I have any&#xD;
. knowledge, nor did I expect to sef any person there. When Mrs.&#xD;
Nourse saw the crowd, consisting of some ,forty or fifty persons,&#xD;
crowding close around the' diggers. she was 'frightened, and refused&#xD;
to goto the place until the c-Rowd was requested to get back, which&#xD;
was done, and all except thre three diggers withdrew a few steps&#xD;
from the place,&#xD;
Q. As soon as the ceremoiies were gone through with accord-&#xD;
ing to ghostly rite, was not the little visionary sent from home.&#xD;
A. I am not familiar with the ceremonies of which you ask, if&#xD;
there he such. I did send Clara away next day to avoid as much of&#xD;
the excitaent as possible, fearing she might see the pink spectre&#xD;
again and become poetically Juchined.&#xD;
Q. Why not before,&#xD;
A. I saw no necessity for it.&#xD;
If I am the party alluded to as being behind the scenes, and&#xD;
whether I am or not, I assume the responsibility to reply, and place&#xD;
myself prominently at the helm, under my own proper signature,&#xD;
and defend my child and all others attacked from the scurrillous and&#xD;
unprovoked abuses contained in said letter ; and inform your corres-&#xD;
pondent that from the incipiency of this mysterious proceeding I&#xD;
have stood in the front rank and battled for the quietude of the pub-&#xD;
lic mind as best I could. But public sentiment was too strong for&#xD;
me. Excitment seized the reins and drove off the chariot.&#xD;
And now in conclusion, Mfr..Editor, I propose to ask your cor-&#xD;
resprad,ent a few questions;: pnd you having :vouched for him as a&#xD;
gentleman, surely he will not refuse to answer as fully and faithfully&#xD;
as I have done :&#xD;
1. Are you a physician ? If so, what is the meaning . of abnor-&#xD;
mal, when applied to the human system, and.what are its effects ?&#xD;
2. Have you ever exar :ngud my daughter Clara to see if she was&#xD;
thus affected?  If so, when, where and at whose request?&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7604-00000009"/>&#xD;
16&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Were you present at Dr. Earle's revival when she got relig-&#xD;
ion ? If so, where was it ?&#xD;
4. Has she been strongly affected for two whole months prior&#xD;
to the present excitment ?  If so, how do you know ?   Give&#xD;
names, etc.&#xD;
5.; Did she ever see, or report to have, seen the ghost of Pea-&#xD;

MEMPHIS, March 8,-1871."&#xD;
EDIToR AVALANCHE:-I had hoped, and most ardently desired,&#xD;
that nothing should occur connected with .the Brinkley college&#xD;
ghost story, now so fully before the public, that would render it,&#xD;
necessary for me even t' explain, my name being closely con nected&#xD;
with the affair trom the beginning, most of which has been faith-&#xD;
fully detailed in the Avalande. But-I see a letter in this morning's&#xD;
Avalanche from Mr. Meredith, in which he evidently refers to me in&#xD;
the following language : "A spirit in the city ordered a stump to be&#xD;
dug up in our garden, which was badly done up this morning by&#xD;
enterprising men." I wish to state in reference to the digging up&#xD;
of the stump, that after the excited operations of Saturday night&#xD;
-in which a few gentlemen participated, and several excited ladies&#xD;
were looking on-had proved unavuiling; after the excitement of&#xD;
Sunday, consequent upon the narration in Sunda'y morning's 'Ava-&#xD;
lanche of.the proceedings of the previous. eight had caused thous-&#xD;
ands of the citizens to visit the spot, where, doubtless, many of&#xD;
them expected to see the ghost, loaded down with treasures of gold&#xD;
and pitchers of silver. After I had been interviewed, examined,&#xD;
catechised, interrogated and'cross-questioned by at least one thous-&#xD;
and men-including newspaper reporters, editors, doctors, lawyers,&#xD;
preachers, merchants, tradesmen, mechanics, laborers, to say noth.-&#xD;
ing of two thousand women, children, and negroes of all shades, from&#xD;
the saffron to the darkest"Â°ebon color, and had endeavored to&#xD;
answer civilly at least ten thousand questions--I did think, it was&#xD;
time to dig up the balance of the old stump, and so reported to Mr.&#xD;
Meredith: I told him I thought public sentiment demanded it, and&#xD;
while I had no faith in the operation, liat the question would not&#xD;
be satisfactorily settled until it was done, to which he replied that&#xD;
he was of the same opinion, and had intended to go and see 'me in&#xD;
reference'to it, and with thisiutual agreement and understanding&#xD;
between us in'the presence of Mrs. Meredith ands others, I did send&#xD;
some negroes to complete the work, with instructions to report to&#xD;
&#xD;
1.7&#xD;
&#xD;
me at my' house if they; made any discoveries; but they have not&#xD;
yet reported. I make this statement to place myself in a proper&#xD;
light b fore the public, and to show that I was acting in concert&#xD;
with Mr. M., trying more to satisfy the public mind and if possible&#xD;
pour oil on the troubled waters rather than gratify a curiosity I&#xD;
really did not have.&#xD;
As to his insinuation in the same letter that my little daughter&#xD;
was influenced by the devil, leave the public to judge as between&#xD;
her and Mr. Meredith.                J. R. ROBERTSON.&#xD;
The following is an anonymous letter published in the Appeal&#xD;
March, 9th, 1871.&#xD;
EDITOR APPEAL :--I wish to ask your pardon for intruding this&#xD;
long letter on your valuable space.. I am  the more particularly&#xD;
induced to do this because:it happens to be upon a subject that you&#xD;
have very properly and-with becoming dignity and decency passed&#xD;
silently ov r during the female excitement of the last four or five&#xD;
(lays. This "communication is about that "ghost."  I bought a&#xD;
phamphlet"at Mansford's this evening, which gives an account of.&#xD;
that revelation (?) from begining to end, if the end is yet, . I read&#xD;
it through carefully and Must cotnfess that the excitement in the&#xD;
female community had some excuse after pondering on that sort of&#xD;
a " get up." I was out of town, thank Providence, during those ex-&#xD;
citing days. but as I was passing Grenada, Miss., coming home, 1&#xD;
met a friend, and he aske4 me in astonishment : "Why, you are&#xD;
not going to town, are you? ,The.people are all crazy there,- they&#xD;
have gone wild about a ghost'; my wife his the doctor attending&#xD;
her ever since Sunday evening, and she has swallowed about a quart&#xD;
of.Dover's powders.". I siniled at this, but when I reached the city&#xD;
I found my own wife sick,. and my two eldest girls writing poetry&#xD;
about pink ghosts and blotted lightning. I fonnd. It necessary to&#xD;
look into this business a little, and with all proper deference to every&#xD;
body's feelings, I must say .the affair is a shame and a disgrace to&#xD;
those who originated this big bugbear. From the best information&#xD;
L ran get, and I am in a position to learn something of the inside&#xD;
history of this event, I believe there is an abnormal condition of the&#xD;
nervous system at the bottom of it. When Dr. Earle held forth at&#xD;
the Greenlaw seine time agoj this little girl got religion and since&#xD;
that time as been .irmagiatively affected to a painfully laughable&#xD;
extent. Two whole Month8, before anything,publicly was known&#xD;
about this thing, that, gidl had been:seeing daily and nightly visions&#xD;
of all sorts at horn:a a vll as' in school. She would not sleep alone&#xD;
in thenight. At oebestime she saw the ghost of Mr. ,Peabody, the&#xD;
philanth'opist, who told he that he tended to endow the Brinkly&#xD;
College with a yearlyreVenue of twenty-flve thousand dollars; and&#xD;
that.he had made out the papers, but his physiciancgave him a dose&#xD;
of hydrate of chloral,'took tiho ;ppers out of his hand and--,-and has&#xD;
themhet. The physics ns Iae.is White, and hoe i rs at-89QHyde&#xD;
Park, London. Re is' a-little Ilorid man.ith higi pek bones, a&#xD;
small black.eye and grey bristly hair, and has a family of ten ellil-&#xD;

&#xD;
dren. This was tle first serious vision that I have heard of as&#xD;
coming to the astonishingly piercing ken of this'child. Aftet that&#xD;
she lhad/ various :tabulated visions of a religious character, and1&#xD;
finiall~ycame to 'the pink infant with its marvelous revelations about&#xD;
docdnents. Tose revelations'came first, fully thirty days ago: ,I&#xD;
was in town at the time myself and heard about it. Plenty of peo-&#xD;
ple'ieard of it, but every one of my acquaintances, without any ex-&#xD;
crptibn ,looked upon this as a, peculiar aberrition of mind.  \.&#xD;
Spanish  flphblister was prescribed for the back of the child's neck.&#xD;
combined wieh an internal mercurial treatment. But thiswas con-&#xD;
sidered too severe and would not be adopted, then, as - a sort of&#xD;
compromise, the Doctor recommended perfect quiet, with a diet of&#xD;
mush and mi'k.; but the young lady, continued to.go to school and to&#xD;
see visions. Now, to s'hoN you that this thing is purely a sort of&#xD;
physical weakness, it is ouly necessary to say that the teacher of&#xD;
the girl's brother in the Linden street school will attest the truth&#xD;
of the fact that he is' subject to a sort of nervons derangement'un-&#xD;
like anything'that ever came under their observation. The mani-.&#xD;
festations of this derangement are not unfretent, and often take&#xD;
the form-,of:"-fits," which was the name his' school-fellows gave his&#xD;
little physical idiosyncracies, though the doctors say they were&#xD;
nothing of the sort. Those pink visions concerning the stump, and&#xD;
the " documents." were' old at the time the midnight excavations&#xD;
commenced. I told you:,ahotit that strange child in the office of the&#xD;
Appeal in the-first part; of the week, the night before I went to Mis-&#xD;
sissippi. I also:'ruentionod to you how . these things, which we all',&#xD;
consider infirmities, were sought to be kept private until the young&#xD;
lady should "get over"I her complaint. What it was that induced&#xD;
the operations of  turday night, I cannot say. Why theyawere&#xD;
not cmmenced tetn ds before is unaccountable to me, unless this&#xD;
Mrs. Nourse, the old woman from St Louis, commenced operations&#xD;
on older heads than the child's, or whether it was a masterly stroke'&#xD;
to put an end to the whole series of visions in the mind of the child;&#xD;
but then as long as the ' jar happened to be in the female public&#xD;
mind, 1 may be pardoned for denlanding answers to the following&#xD;
queties:e&#xD;
Was not that peach'preserve jar bought at2Jack's china store at&#xD;
nine' o'clock on Monday morning-? Didenot the colored woman -ho&#xD;
was -sent'for that jtr ;get an old one dollar bill 'sith a rent in it, to.&#xD;
pay for 'her purchase? _aas she not toldwhea he came home,&#xD;
that sh'e paid fiveeertts too niuch foritr? ' 'Wascit not "fixeb up" at&#xD;
the hour of twelve :on Monday, in a certain bank parlor ? and was&#xD;
rot the ceiling-wax purchased at Yoira''s bankrupt sale ? Does not&#xD;
that jaras it=iC ow, weigh about two pounds avoirdupois? Is there&#xD;
n'ot isnall packdge'of No. 2 shot injit,? -Are not the papers con-&#xD;
posed of the following documents: Fiveblank forms of attachment;&#xD;
three sheets of legal cap, upon which is written an old case in the&#xD;
Chancery Court; a '"wiSh bone," done up in tissue' paper, over-&#xD;
lapped with note paper, an old compbsition.,of the -child's, covering&#xD;
&#xD;
four pages of letter paper. A little box.for holding a gold ring,&#xD;
covered in white tea paper, and..a sheet'of musie" Lay mo-inmy,&#xD;
little bed," folded four times?  Did not-Mrs. Nourse carry-that jar&#xD;
down to-the hole under her cloak ? Were not the colored excavators&#xD;
instructed to say that they saw the, jar whil4 they were digging 'for&#xD;
it, and that it moved away from them, and then=they jumped out of&#xD;
the hole in apparent :affright?  Did not they'programme, whatever:&#xD;
was tho object of it, include the moving of thescrowd away from the&#xD;
hole, while the previously appointed finder should go-in and get it?&#xD;
What was all 4th s done for? As soon as the cerinoniesihad been&#xD;
properly gone through, according to ghostly rite, was  not;the l'tle&#xD;
viuonary sert from home? 'Why not before?    I just make bold&#xD;
enough, to ask these questions because the matter touched upon have&#xD;
become subject's of public discussion; without a word of protest' or&#xD;
condemnation from the parties behind the scenes. A number of our&#xD;
weak-minnded population' have' been imposedupon, and it is the chiv-&#xD;
alrous, duty of the strong to protect the weak. whether theassault&#xD;
he aimed at their minds, theit affections or their persons, in their.be-&#xD;
half I' speak.i A pubic ghost of indignation has been invoked,&#xD;
which swill not down uh deiP the influence - of 'bottled .or- any other&#xD;
sort Of spirits.&#xD;
Perhaps the 'diligent searchers into the "angel world" could tell&#xD;
what it was that moved the -child's chair in Townsend's house-the:&#xD;
other nitht. when sbe sat with her little feet upon the cross-bar and&#xD;
her hands meekly folded on her breast, and the. chairs with its gentle&#xD;
burden, stepped from the wall over to the able in 'the middle of the&#xD;
icoin, was the pink ghost under that chair, or did the "-meejumn"&#xD;
from St. Louis rmanipilate the transaction ?. What was done by the&#xD;
"'meejum "at Robertnou's last night ? I received a verbal "invite"&#xD;
to attend that seace-" for the purpose of seeing with your own eyes&#xD;
what Che can do "- --to receive ocular aid aurieulr and nasal demon&#xD;
stration, I suppose, that she can do a thing or two in the way of&#xD;
ailingg up "sperite" from the vasty deep. Was this delving at the&#xD;
stump, by the pale, silvery light of the moon, a sort-of elever adver-&#xD;
tising dodge for the regular 'operations of the " meejiu," which are'&#xD;
now regularly to follow?  The arrangements fior thirteen, meetings;&#xD;
-to stake place between now and, the appointed time'of the jar partus&#xD;
rition have been perfected; and the persons to the number of four&#xD;
lindred who are to be invited are noted down. Some :of those 'thus&#xD;
fixed upon would be astonished to know that they are the objects of&#xD;
so much attention and Oonsideration.  They are, not to be-notiiied&#xD;
until it is thought that the proper impression is inade,&#xD;
I have merely glanced, at a little part of the insideltmaehitiety of&#xD;
this thing. I may write{you more of the :"lying wonders "inn day&#xD;
or two.I'in the, meantime permit me to suggest to'- yourAternale,&#xD;
readers to  possess their souls in peace, and, whenthey are engad4&#xD;

finding some objections thereto, determined to give them the entire&#xD;
proceeds, and addressed to the Avalanchc the following note:&#xD;
EniroRs AvALANCHE-Will you be kind enough to announce in&#xD;

Clara Robertson, being the ceihtral figure in the story of the&#xD;
" Ghost of Brinkley College,' it' was thought worth while, in&#xD;
order to satisfy the inquiries of many yho. wish to know  the&#xD;
character of the person who has seen 1f"traveler from the un-&#xD;
discovered country,"'I to apply the tcstof what Maybehcalled a&#xD;
cross examination, and to elicit from the girls own lps&#xD;
saw, and her own belief and sources of information.  rJ.his ha-&#xD;
been done, and the examination is published in full below.&#xD;
An  observer's frst impression after conversing with  her&#xD;
awhile, is that she is intelligent and bright beyond her years,&#xD;
and at the same time full of'simplicity, candor and truthfulness.&#xD;
The reporter looked closely for wildness of expression about the&#xD;
eyes and apparent'wandering of the mind, and tried to stagger&#xD;
her with questions, in every possible way during the narrative,&#xD;
but saw and elicited nothing to cast the shadow of a doubt upon&#xD;
her belief sof what she stated.. The interview was follows:&#xD;

practicing at the piano in the upper hail of the college. It has&#xD;
a door opening out over the porch, hut it was closed with a box&#xD;
against it to keep it shut. Katy Wright and Bessie Pointer were&#xD;
in the room on the west side of the hall.  While practicing, I&#xD;
saw what appeared to be a little girl coming softly up stairs.&#xD;
When it reached the top it stopped with one foot ion the upper&#xD;
step. I looked towards it and asked, what it wanted, when it&#xD;
shook its head, and then in a moment came towards Me, not&#xD;
walking but gliding. Ai it approached I saw it was a skeleton,&#xD;
and screaming I ran into the room where were Katy Wright and&#xD;
Bessie Pointer, the one reading and the other looking out the&#xD;
window. 'They screamed too, and we all rushed to the bed and&#xD;
got on to it, myself on the outside. The figure followed, pulled&#xD;
my dress vi lently and then fingered with my hair, which was&#xD;
done up in a net. We screamed all the time. The spectre, after&#xD;
pulling at me for several moments, went hack to the door, stood&#xD;
there a moment and then crossed the hall to Miss Dora Hill's&#xD;
room, where it knocked and then tried the door. when I heard it&#xD;
say, as if in disappointment:  Oh, Lord ." in a pitiful, weak,&#xD;
hollow voice. It then came back to our door and beckoned to mnc&#xD;
with its first finger for about two minutes, when recess was an-&#xD;
nounced, and as some of the scholars came up the stairs the ap-&#xD;
parition vanished through the garret door.&#xD;
Rep.-Did not any of the, teachers or scholars hear you and,&#xD;
your companions screaming? Clara-No, sir, The pianos were&#xD;
playing down stairs and they could not hear us.&#xD;
Rep.--Did the spectre beckon to all who were in the room, or&#xD;
to you alone? Clara-It seemed to beckon to nobody but me.&#xD;
Rep.-IDid Katie Wright and Bessie Pointer see the appari-&#xD;
tion ?. Clara-They said the did, and continued to say so up to&#xD;
last. Monday, but I don't know; they may only have been&#xD;
frightened because I was. I think both attend the school yet,&#xD;
though I heard one had been sent into the country.&#xD;
Rep.-Did you tell the teachers and scholars about this when&#xD;
they came up stairs? Clara-Yes, aned they laughed and said it&#xD;
was only my imagination, though Bessie and Katie said. they&#xD;
saw it, too,, -and were crying.&#xD;
sRep.-ad you tell yo r Pa on going home, of what had oc-&#xD;
cured? Clara - I did, and he ridiculed me, saying it was hallu-&#xD;
cination and that I must think of'it no more, but I knew it was&#xD;
not. imagination&#xD;
Rep.-Did Dora Hill hear the figure at the door?  Clara -I&#xD;
think she did.&#xD;
Rep.-When you first saw the figure at the top of the stairway,,&#xD;
what did you do ? Clara-i kept on practicing.&#xD;
Rep.- -Were. you not frightened? Clara-I was not, because&#xD;
I thought at first it was little Minnie Meredith..&#xD;
fep.-Did byou toph playing the piano and why? Clara-I did&#xD;
after a little, because 'the figurekept motionles at the head of the&#xD;
&#xD;
stairs, and I thought-it was somebody whh wanted to speak to me,&#xD;
and was waiting or me to stop. When I stopped and it cameto-&#xD;
wardsinc I saw it was not a living thing. and -I screamed and ran&#xD;
Rep,-What was the specire like ? Clara-Like a skeleton, all&#xD;
bone and sinews, covered with a skin, through which I could see, it&#xD;
being very transparent. It was a frighttul looking object. fits&#xD;
teeth protruded from, the fleshless mouth and its eyes deep set, a,&#xD;
ot i  the back of the head. The hair and eyes were deep black,&#xD;
the hair loose ard l     i gvr. Tlio face was ugly, but at the same&#xD;
time it had a lpale and sorroa lul lm~k.&#xD;
Rep.-Had it any clothing?     Clara--It was dressed in very&#xD;
light or faded pink, like ir etan, arid the dress was trimmed with&#xD;
dingy white rouc inm. It wore aoo pink or r6d slippers or shoes,&#xD;
am    not sure which.   Ihe sockings looked moulded and mil-&#xD;
dewed, as did also the dress. on which there were heavy spots of&#xD;
moulde ardgreenish slime. 'The shoes or slippers were also much&#xD;
oelded.&#xD;
Rep.-Did your conipanions see it in the same way ?  Clara-&#xD;

Thursday.&#xD;
Rep.-Under What circumstances? Clara-I was in Emma&#xD;
Butt's room. Emma was there; also Dora Hill, Katy Wright and&#xD;
Bessie Pointer  The door was closed. I heard a noise in the hall&#xD;
as if some one was dashing water on the floor, and scrubbing with a&#xD;
broom. I said, who can that be scrubbing? but did not think of&#xD;
the spectre. Emma Butts went and opened the door, and the rest&#xD;
of us followed. As the door opened, I saw Lizzie in the middle of&#xD;
the hall. The other girls did not seem to see 'her. I screamed and&#xD;
the spectre vanished, seeming to go through the garret door as b&#xD;
tire. Emma Butt's and Dora Hill tried to coax me out of the no-&#xD;

Rep.-Now, Clara, don't you know you see the apparition only&#xD;
with your mind's eye? Clara-Oh, no, sir'; [ saw it with my real&#xD;
eye, as I see you now, and it has talked to me as I now talk to you.&#xD;

Rep-Who did tell youC? Clra--Nobody      told me but the&#xD;
spectre.&#xD;
Rep.--When did you see the spectre again, and what occurred&#xD;
Clara-The next Monday. Feeling afraid of the spectre, I would&#xD;
not go up stairs, but went into room No. 5 on the first floor to prac-&#xD;
tide. Miss Jackey Boone, the teacher, wouldn't let any one go in&#xD;
with me, so I went in alone and fastened the door with the knob-&#xD;
catch. After I had played about five minutes. the door suddenly&#xD;
flew open, and looking around I saw the spectre standing in the&#xD;
hall. It looked as it did before, but had in one of its hands a little&#xD;
hag and a stick with.a sharp point. The bag looked as if made of&#xD;
bed-ticking, and the stick looked old and rusty ; it might have been&#xD;
iron. The spectre glided toward me and stood in the doorway.  I&#xD;
ran to the windows'and tried-to .get out, but could not open them.&#xD;
1 then tried to get throult the door, and was caught by the dress&#xD;
by Lizzie, who held mae with one hand, while with the other she&#xD;
shook the little bag up near its ear. Something sounded like brass&#xD;
or tin. I screamed and broke away, rushing into Miss Boon's&#xD;
room, on the opposite side of the hall. She was giving music les-&#xD;
sons to some of the girls. The spectre first tried to keep me from&#xD;
fretting out of the room in which I was in. When I got to Miss&#xD;
Boon's room I told her the little iod girl was in No. 2. She took me&#xD;
by the hand and we went back andl hantedall around the room, and&#xD;
in the hall, but saw nothing. Miss Boone would not believe re.&#xD;
and laughed at me real hard.&#xD;
Rep.-Was Mr. Meredith there ?  Clara-Yes, sir. He laughed-&#xD;
too, and said he would set a trap for the ghost. After which he&#xD;
scolded me for frightening the girls.&#xD;
Rep.-What occurred next"! Clara-Next day I went up to pa's&#xD;
office before going to school, and saVv Mrs. Nourse there, She was&#xD;
talking to him about some business. - Pa told her about Lizzie, and&#xD;
she told me I must speak to it,, that it would do me no harm. F&#xD;
then went to. school, In the afternoon, myself and some other girls&#xD;
were in the hall watching for the ghost, when it came up suddenly.&#xD;
I don't know where it came from. It seemed to rise out of the floor.&#xD;
I screamed and some of thesother girls screamed too. Bessie Point-&#xD;
er says she saw a shadow. Frida Stewart swung her arms all about&#xD;
her as if to keep the spirit away, and seemed to be unable to control&#xD;
them, -as they kept swinging some time. Sonic of the girls urged&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7604-00000014"/>&#xD;
28&#xD;
me to speak to the spirit, but I declined through fear. Etich ono&#xD;
spoke to it, but seemed to get no answer, and then I was urged again&#xD;
to speak to it, I'then said  In the name of the Lord,"-that's the&#xD;
way Iwas told to address it- what do you 1w a it.,' It pointed to-&#xD;
wards some stumps on the west side of the houe, and told me to go&#xD;
and dig five Feet under a stump, and I would find a jar that would&#xD;
be of value to me. I ran to the window and looked out at the stump,&#xD;
and way turning to ask which stump, when it vanished. I was much&#xD;
excited, but not as much afraid as I had been before. The spectre&#xD;
had the stick and little bag again, and looked very sad and pitiful,&#xD;
but seemed to cheer up aidd get less ug ly when I spoke.&#xD;
Rep.-Did any of thel othes girls see it? Clara-Bessie Pointer&#xD;
said she saw a shadow, and also heard a sort of mumbling, and&#xD;
thought she heard the word stump.&#xD;
Rep.-When did you see this thing ag-in ? Clara-On Wednes-&#xD;
day. I went to the garden to sharpen my slate pencil, and while so&#xD;
engaged I saw the figure appear on a stump and try to call my nt-&#xD;
tice. I pretended not to see it, and went on sharpening my pencil,&#xD;
when it started towards toe with its arms stretched out. I was not&#xD;
rruch atraid at first, and thought if I appeared not to notice it it&#xD;
would go away; but when it came towards me I got very much&#xD;
frightened, screamed loudly and attempted to run away. It stepped&#xD;
on another stump, looked very pitiful and' said, pAeal ingly :  Don't&#xD;
be afraid of me ; I will not hurt you ; my name is Lizzie. What I&#xD;
an about to say you must not tell anybody but your father."  I&#xD;
stood as if fastaned to the spot. The figure then went on to say that&#xD;
she was the last of her people, and that the property belonged to her&#xD;
-I mean the college property. She said she wanted me to have it,&#xD;
because I had set her free by speaking to her. That Mr. Brinkley&#xD;
claimed the property, but it'did not belong to him, and that he should&#xD;
not have it-she would take it away from him. It I didn t get the&#xD;
property no one could ever live in the house in peace. Sne had&#xD;
haunted the place for a long time but could never, get anybody she&#xD;
wanted to speak to her,'but now she felt free because I had spoken&#xD;
to her, and for that reason she wanted me to have the place-Mr.&#xD;
Brinkley had no right to it. She then told me again there was&#xD;
something under that stump that would be of value to me-the&#xD;
stump on which she stood. It then vanished, and I ran into the&#xD;
house.C&#xD;
Rep.-Did the spectre say all her people were dead ? Clara-No;.&#xD;
she said she was the last one who had any right to that property-.&#xD;
Rep.-Did you feel glad at the prospect of getting the property ?&#xD;
Clara-I did not think anything about it.&#xD;
Rep.-Did you believe there was anything under t e stump?&#xD;
(lara-I was sure of it after she told me.&#xD;
Rep.-Did you ever think so before?   Clara-I neve did, and&#xD;

Rep.-Do you believe a jar was dug up there?  Clara.-I know&#xD;

Rep-Have you the jar now ? Clara-I have not.&#xD;
Hop.-Is it in a safe place ?  Clara-Yes, sir.&#xD;
'Rep.-How do you know?    Clara-My pai told me so.&#xD;

Rep. -Vas that here, in your house ? Clara-Yes sir ; I was in&#xD;
a trance or asleep, and don't know much of what was written, ex-&#xD;

Rep.-Did you point out the stump?   Clara-Not at first, be-&#xD;

to call upon Lizzie, and I did so. She appeared anu showed me&#xD;
the stump and said to dig on one.side of it.&#xD;
Rep.-Hadn't Lizzie pointed it out to you before?  Clara-She&#xD;
(lid, but she ran from one stump to another to get near me, and I&#xD;
was uncertain which of the stumps was the right one.&#xD;
Rep -Did you believe there was anything under the stump ?&#xD;
Clara-I was sure there was, because Lizzie told me.&#xD;
Rep.-Did'nt your pa and Mrs. Nourse tell you so too ? Clara-&#xD;

asked me to so as to be sure of the place.&#xD;

So ended the interview, which the strange child bore with&#xD;
singular patience and good nature, never faltering or stammer-&#xD;
ing under the most rigid examination. See ' as cross-examined&#xD;
many times, and gave the direct answer.'&#xD;
Leveral curious facts are worthy of mention ;in connection&#xD;
with the narrative of this girl, and are topics of excitsd and earn-&#xD;
est discussion in all circles. Briefly they are as follows:&#xD;
There was a a Lizzie Davie, and she died at Brinkley College&#xD;
some time in 1860.&#xD;
She is described by persons who remembered her well as a&#xD;
child of remarkable intelli rence, beauty precociasnIess, and sne&#xD;
had black flowing hair and black eyes.&#xD;
Persons who Were at her funeral says she was laid out and&#xD;
buried in a dress of pink; with white trimming, and pink slippers.&#xD;
They remember this from the singularity of the dress, it being the&#xD;
custom almost universally to shroud children in wliite.- She was&#xD;
about six or eight years of' agze, and is well remembered for her&#xD;
beauty, brightness and goodness. It is remembered by old and&#xD;
reliable citizens that there was a chancery suit about the ground on&#xD;
which 'Brinkley College stands, and that there was much scandal at&#xD;
the time. Thie college was built by Mr. Davie for a residence about&#xD;
1855. The chancery suit, as can be remembered, concerned the&#xD;
ground only. It matters not about the jar alleged to have been&#xD;
found under the stump at Brinkley college. Clara Robertson in&#xD;
the object of interest. Who will undertake to explain her case,&#xD;
theoretically or practically.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
Last evening a number of persons, friends of the family, were&#xD;
sitting in the parlors, when a noise was heard in the back yard, as&#xD;
of some persons talking. Mr. Robertson remarked that some per-&#xD;
son was evidently in the yard and went out to see what was the&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
0  3&#xD;
matter', Nothing was seen or, heard of him for about five minutes,&#xD;
when a, servantnn kytwn as Joe, came running into the-parlor&#xD;
and said-that Mr.,o 'ertson waslying dead in the back part of the&#xD;
yard. Several of the gentlereri, accompanied by Joe, immedhstely&#xD;
proceeded to where M r. Robertson was, and found hia lying insen-&#xD;
sible in a ppol. of, blopd near a small stable in the rear of his lot, He "'-&#xD;
was carried into t't l ousre, a physician was sent -for, and'in a few.&#xD;
minutes Dr. H.     W h arrived and at once admtiistered restora-&#xD;
tives and proceeded to examine the wounds upon M. Robertson's&#xD;
head. Ho found a, Ianrg ugly-looking wound, that appeared as'Wif&#xD;
made with a knife orsome sharp instrument, extending four inches&#xD;
over the forehead, from" the left eye back toward the crown of: his&#xD;
head, and aldo the marks eo fa person's fingers'upon his throat, as if.&#xD;
he had been cho'ld,  It was about a half an hour before Mr. Rob-&#xD;
ertson was fully restored to eonn ;o _ ness and in a condition'to state&#xD;
how he..had received his wounds.'. Some one rearked that they&#xD;
thought they her, 'a noise in the back yard, and Mr. R; telling&#xD;
them that he would beback in 'a few minutes,started out, and when&#xD;
he got out of the house he could see no one, and walking back, en-&#xD;
tered an outhouse attached to the premises. Just as he stepped in&#xD;
the :outhouse, he noticed a couple of inen standingunder a low wood&#xD;
shed about ten feet from where he was. He had but just noticed&#xD;
them, and ha not hacd timo to give any alarm, when the men rushed&#xD;
out from under the shed and caught hold of him, one of them at the&#xD;
same instant shoving a pistol in front of his face, and telling him to&#xD;
give no alarm or they would kill him. . Mr. Robertson states ti'ft&#xD;
he asked thetit not to shoot him, when they ordered him out of the&#xD;
house, in the door of which he was standing, and then with a pis-&#xD;
tol in his face marched him about twenty-five yards, back to the ex-&#xD;
treme rear of the lot, to where a small stable is situated. When&#xD;
they got in there they were met by two other men, who were evi-&#xD;
dently waiting for them. As soon as they were in the stables one&#xD;
of the men said to him nWe have come after that jar, and you have&#xD;
got to tell us where it is or we'll kill you."  Mr. Robertson, fearing&#xD;
for his life, told them that the, jar was underneath the seat in the&#xD;
outhouse attached to a rope. and' told them how to get it. Two-of&#xD;
the men at.oace started to 'the outhouse, while the other two.,re-&#xD;
nmained with him,guarding him, with thnir pistols pointed at his&#xD;
head and threatening to kill him if he attempted to escape or made&#xD;
any noise. In about two minutes the men returned with the jar in&#xD;
their possession, when one of the men who had been guarding the&#xD;
prisoner, suddenly grasped him by the throat and applying a vile epi-&#xD;
thet to him, commenced choking him severely. Mr R. begged the&#xD;
man for God's sake not to kill him, as they now had what they&#xD;
wanted; and while he was 'still speaking, another of the ruffians&#xD;
struck him a violent blow over the'head with what 'he supposed was a&#xD;
pistol and rendered 'him unconcious. Just before he was struck he&#xD;
-cried oue : "Oh,' Joe, come to me quick;" and it was this cry evident-&#xD;
ly that caused him to be struck, It is supposed that the, men fled&#xD;
immediately after hitting him, as when his servant, Joe, arrived' a few&#xD;
&#xD;
c,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7604-00000017"/>&#xD;
84&#xD;
minutes later no traee of them was to be seen. When Mr. R.'s ser-&#xD;
vant did reach the scene, which wai as soon as he could get there&#xD;
after hearing the cry for help, he found that gentleman, as we have&#xD;
stated, lying. in an insensible condition in a poolof blood just outside&#xD;
ofthe stable door, and upon making the discovery at once gave the&#xD;
alarm. Mr. Robertson says he had a good look at the two assailants&#xD;
who were under - the wood shed and made the first attack upon him.&#xD;
He described one of the them as being a man of 'meditam size, light&#xD;
hair, light coipplexion, dressed in a suit of dark clothes. He did&#xD;
not notice any distinguishing marks, beyond those above give upon&#xD;
the men, but thinks he could recognize them if he were to see them&#xD;
again. Dr. Shaw had carefully dressed his wounds and he felt very&#xD;
well, beyond a sharp pain in his head, caused by the wound. Mr.&#xD;
Robertson states that.he received on Monday morning a letter telling&#xD;
him that violence was intended him, but thought nothing of it until&#xD;
this attack ; and yesterday evening when he came home from his of-&#xD;
tee he brought a letter directed to Mrs. Nurse, who was stopping at&#xD;
his house, telling her that violence was intended him for his connec-&#xD;
tObn with the jar. The question now is, who. attacked Mr. Roberts'&#xD;
son ? and at whose instigation was the attack made?  Are there any&#xD;
persons who feared the results of tde jar opening ?  Were the ruffians&#xD;
actuated by a desire to plunder, believing the jars' contents to be&#xD;
valuables'?  This seems to be the most probable theory , as Mr. R..&#xD;
during the entire excitement growing out of the Brinkley College&#xD;
fair, has only, like hundreds of others, sought to unravel the mys-&#xD;
tery ; is a man, whose life is blameless, and we doubt it he has a per-&#xD;
sonal enemyin6 the world.,&#xD;
The arrangements being perfected, it only remained to secure the&#xD;
Opera Wouse, procure tickets and proceed at the appointed time to&#xD;
operythe mysterious jar. But, alas ! our troubles are not yet ended,&#xD;
although we had passed through the fiery ordeal of the most fierce Â°&#xD;
and unrelenting persecution, while the voice of the vilest slanderer&#xD;
had ceased not to echo from the sea hound shores of the East to the&#xD;
golden valle s of the West. Although we Ihad perfected our plans&#xD;
thus far, and the hope of speedy deliverance from our troubles was&#xD;
inspiring us to still persevere. Yet we were doomed to learn that&#xD;
behind the throne was a power that even woman, with all her love-&#xD;
liness and virtue ministering, as only woman can, to the wants of&#xD;
the living, cooling the fevered parched lips of the dyeing, and fol-&#xD;
lowing to their last resting place the remain of the dead, dare not&#xD;
come' in contact. The Bishop disapproves the entire programme&#xD;
and with one fell swoop of his mortal pen disorganizes the whole&#xD;
ghost fraternity, and does not so much as ca I at our sanctum and&#xD;
pass hi.j hands over us, or direct us to wash ur hands in the river&#xD;
Jordan, or send his man Friday to apprise us of our horrible fate,&#xD;
but notifies the'world in general, and mankind in particular, through&#xD;
the Appeal, that the contribution proposed would not be accepted":'&#xD;
Editors Appeal-Will you kindly inform the public that the ex-&#xD;
hibition announced for Thursday night n xt, at the Greenlaw&#xD;
&#xD;
Opera House, not being approved, no part of the proceeds will be&#xD;
accepted by the Church Home.                C. T. QUINTA1tD,&#xD;
Episcopal Residence, March 27:.    President Board Manigers.&#xD;
To relirve us. however, from this dilemma that great and noble&#xD;
physician, that true patriotic spirit that bows only to the God t4t&#xD;
gave it, Dr. A. K. Taylor, assumed the responsibility on behalf '1f&#xD;
his excellent wife, and undertook to distribute the funds for the&#xD;
benefit of the suffering &amp;amp;f the city. From the time the communi..&#xD;
cation requesting the opening of the jar in public feared, he was&#xD;
in daily receipt of letters warning him not to at mpt such a pro-&#xD;
ceedir.e, least his life and the life of Clara should pay the forfeit.&#xD;
In addition to this he was repeatedly admonished-by friends that a&#xD;
deeply concerted plan had been concocted which was to result it,&#xD;
the capture of the jar before it reached the Greenlaw Opera House,&#xD;
to all of which, however, he gave but little credence, and still per-&#xD;
sisted in eatrying out his published programme. -And now without&#xD;
stopping to notice the many vauge undefined theories that have&#xD;
been advanced relative to the ghost, the jar, the Brinkley property,&#xD;
etc., etc., we must close this little narrative after adducing our proof&#xD;
as to one or two points. And, first, as to the finding the jar, that&#xD;
it was found as heretofore published in the Avalanche. We assert,&#xD;
without the shadow of a fear of successful contradiction, but for the&#xD;
benefit of skeptics and unbelievers, insert the following.affidavits :&#xD;
STATE OF TENNEssEI, SHELBY COUNTY.&#xD;
Personally appeared before me, John E. Burke, J. P. for said&#xD;
county, William Taylor, Joseph L. Pierson and Ransom Christopher,&#xD;
who, being duly sworn, deposes as follows, to-wit: States, that on&#xD;
the 5th of March, inst., that they were employed by J. R. Robert-&#xD;
son toassist in digging up a stump near Brinkley Female College,&#xD;
in the city of Memphis, that they did so assist and finished the&#xD;
work as directed, but failed to find the treasure supposed to be there.&#xD;
That on] the evening of ths 6th, which was the ensuing evening,&#xD;
they were again employed by said Robertsonto dig again at the&#xD;
same place, but was instructed to dig over a certain brick work&#xD;
that had been discovered while making the excavation the pre-&#xD;
vious evening, that they  went to the   place and  commenced&#xD;
to dig as instructed, that when they had gone down about two and&#xD;
a half feet, said Ro ertso, accompanied by Mrs. Nourse, came to&#xD;
them ; that Mrs. Nohrse remarked that the instructions were for Mr.&#xD;
Robertson to dig himself. Whereupon said Robertson tobk off his&#xD;
coat, got into the place already dug out, and commenced to dig,&#xD;
and after he had descended about one foot found a glass jar under a&#xD;
portion of said brick work, and dug it out. It was picked up by&#xD;
M rs. Nourse, and the whole crowd, consisting of some fifty persons,&#xD;
proceeded to Robertsons house, where quite a number, including&#xD;
ourselves, examined said jar. Affiant states that from the time said&#xD;
Robertson took the spade out of Taylor's hand until the jar was&#xD;
dug up,-they were within four or five feet of him, watching every spade&#xD;
full of dirt that was taken up, and knows that there was no deception,&#xD;
on the part of Robertson as to the fin ding of the same. Affiants&#xD;

4 nd now, reader, it only remains for us to give the contents of&#xD;
the mysterious jar, and there is , prospect of securing its captors, as&#xD;
revealed to Miss Clara whilh in an entranced state with a view solely&#xD;
to that object. The jar containedtwo'thousand dolla-s in gold, one&#xD;
set of gold jewelry and diamond necklace. The paper envelope&#xD;
contained valuable papers, the contents'of which we deem unim-&#xD;
portant to publish at present. . The portraits of the four'captors&#xD;
were portrayed to her mind with such vivid, life-like accur iey' as to&#xD;
enable her at a glance to recognize one of them, and write his name&#xD;
with unmistakeable certainty. The name of one other has since&#xD;
been obtained, and every possible means are being employed to&#xD;
ft        bring the thieves to justice.&#xD;
