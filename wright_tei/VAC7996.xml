what I have to say and what I have to show you."&#xD;
"Now, then, Reveren4 Sir, the last three years of my wretched li~&#xD;
have beezi passed daily in prayer and contrition. You have had doubt,&#xD;
less~much experience among sinner8, do you think that amount of repent..&#xD;
anec will avail to blot 9Ut the black record of at leaat ten years. of 4ate~,&#xD;
able, diabolical wickedness?"&#xD;
The sick man raised himself to a sitting posture, and, grasping ~Iie 1~and&#xD;
of the clergyman, gazed into his fa~e with a look of such in~eu~ anxiety&#xD;
and earnesiness, that the. latter for a mon~eu~ averted his head and though~&#xD;
to himself:&#xD;
"Is this really a man or a demon in the flesh 7"&#xD;
.And he would fain have released himself from the j~ot, dry han~l that&#xD;
held him and left the house. B~~t suddenly,, as b~ expressed hiftiseif, "&#xD;
Aj.)irit of the Lord seemed to come upon him," az~d strenghtene4 him fo~&#xD;
the scene that followed. And he replied;&#xD;
"Poor sinful man, remember that the goodness of God ~s great and that&#xD;
His blessed mercy endureth forever."&#xD;
"Then, Bishop, why is it that there is a hell, and why is it that si~ners&#xD;
g there, if all that is required of them is that they repent? ~' psked 2~ut'&#xD;
ten with increased eagerness.&#xD;
"Because they do not really and truly repent of their e~ns, ~'&#xD;
"But how is .a sinner ~o know that he ,~ fo~giv~n? That is the&#xD;
main point. Answer rue tl~a~ satisfnctorily, for ileaveigs sal~! ".&#xD;
"He feels it in his heart. It comes to him like a gush ~f ~r~ght warm&#xD;
sunshine in the very. midnight of cold and' darkness." ..&#xD;
"He must bcome conscious of it just as lie becomes ~OJi5CIQU5 that he&#xD;
4      lives and yet cannot explain how. Is~ that it?"&#xD;
The dylug man half gasped, then slowly released ~e Bishop's h~an4~&#xD;
and sank back upon his couch, never, however taking his strange, n~g~&#xD;
netie eyes off the clergyman's f*~ce,, As his hea4 touch~l the, pi~low'~ he&#xD;
said in tones of n~ter woe and despsir: ,, , ,&#xD;

.poped they wpuld not trouble themselves about her~ When I found how&#xD;
my mother, had, been treated 'by her professing Christian friends I was&#xD;
much enraged, and' while I had only' bated religion and religious people&#xD;
before, I now conceived a deadly desire to be revenged upon some pious&#xD;
p~rsou. Indeed this dreadful idea becanie the ruling passion of my life.&#xD;
I at once removed my mother to more comfortable quarters. until such&#xD;
tiu~e as I, could buy a~hou~e and take her home to live with me. Com~&#xD;
ing across this house and lot for ~sale, and liking it, I bought it and had&#xD;
it ~'nrnished,. and in, due time my" mother was installed as its mistress.&#xD;
Yet she and I did not agree well for the following reason. The' moment&#xD;
her Church friends found' QUt her altered fortune they commenced to flock&#xD;
round her and to bring her subscription lists for charitable objects. She&#xD;
received them just as though they bad never treated her so contemptibly&#xD;
as they had, aud wished4 to give them nioneyto help along with their&#xD;
good works. I denounced them fiercely as hypocrites, and she excused&#xD;
and defended them. 8o that she and I had frequent ebullitions of feel.&#xD;
ing about the matter.&#xD;
One day in conversation mother chanced to say" to me:&#xD;
"My dear James, yen have the most singular temperament of any ntau&#xD;
I ever saw. Now why do you not 'get' married, to some nice, respectable&#xD;
3nd companionable girl? One who would make' you happy?"&#xD;
The idea was, new to me, and made such a deep impression on my&#xD;
minU that,' I could think of nothing else. And here, as at every other&#xD;
turning point in~ '~y life Satan stepped 'in and moulded my design. I re~&#xD;
solved t~ m~rry, b~~t at the same time 'it should be not fi~r love nor admir.&#xD;
ation; but for~ sheer, diabolical deviltry~ I determined to marry the most&#xD;
pious girl I eould fln4, and~ after she became my wife, to torture her in&#xD;
mind and.body in every way my hellish genius could invent or devise.'&#xD;
Full of ~his wicked intention II conferred with' 'my mother as to who she&#xD;
would marry if she were me. Very~mur~Ii j~leiised to see me entertain&#xD;
the notion of wedlock~ my unsaspectin~ 'parent "named over eight or ten&#xD;
exemplary young women any one of Whom shewas sure' would 'make me&#xD;
~,gpod, kind and lovingwife~ But In particular ehe lauded Miss Mnrtha&#xD;
Mprtou ~. good lookingand estimable young woman of twenty4our.' She&#xD;
was an exceedingly devout church goer, and, 'howard wretch 'that I was,&#xD;
the, fact that shehad not a relative'living, decided' me to eezect her as' my&#xD;
My plot being thus conceded I quickly put it into execution. 'Martha&#xD;
bad visited ~ur house once ~ twic~, and I told motherto invite her again,&#xD;
tb$s time, ,t~ stay ~to tea. Martha gladly came, atid, during her stay 1&#xD;
made ~yseIf as ~gre~ahIe as' I~ possibly could, wfttcbi~g her~ cbntinually&#xD;
Ii~e a f~wIer wat~bes the innocent birdie is erisn'~ring,'to' see what effect&#xD;
~ n~de upon l~er. The poor, uosophistieat~d youvmg worna~i was much&#xD;
q~,t@d, ~nd l~eWild~rQd4 when, attb.time, of her 'starting for home I 'inei~t-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed upon escorting her thither. When, oui reaching the 'house where sli.&#xD;
lived, I asked her permission to pay 'my addresses to her, I knew, from&#xD;
tiietr~nihliog a~eents of her reply, that her heart Was fluttering with alt&#xD;
the ecstacy of new1y.~wakeued' delight '~'&#xD;
During thenext six months I cooked' Martha most attentively; not&#xD;
day or evening ~f the Whole time paying' without our seeiiig e~ch other&#xD;
once or twice. At the ei~d' of' this tiw~ I proposed to her, a2nd was at&#xD;
once accepted. She named a day of a month in advance, but I insisted&#xD;
that no longer delay tbantwo weeks should be made,'giving as nvrejisoa&#xD;
that I 'iVished to get settled down at once. Martha, evOr ready' tu please.&#xD;
me, agreed to my notion and in a fortnight she became my wife. We&#xD;
were married in this very room.&#xD;

At this point of his ,'narrative Sutton suddenly became quite wcak an4&#xD;

could, continue. Whi)e ~ ~ he laid as l~efore perfectly&#xD;

In all Bishop Willian~'s experience ~e had never beheld such, an ~norao.&#xD;
lyin human nature as ~his man.' T&#xD;
narrative, the minister felt convinced hough he had only begun hiu dark&#xD;
that there was something so fearfnj&#xD;
naught       'greatest power of god's z~ercy cou~d;r~&#xD;
to come yet, that     but the&#xD;
d~ein the perinhing,, guilty soul of Sutten. After ten mi~u~es' rest the late&#xD;
ter ~'esizAied his confession.. ' '&#xD;
During m~ mother's lifetime I confined my meditated brutality to prer&#xD;
venting my wife from attending to her 'religious duties, to 'deriding. all&#xD;
religious subj~cts ih1i~r presence. This continued f~ ~bout thirteen&#xD;
mouths when my Wother died. Her death made n~ i~ipxo~ion whatever&#xD;

14                TE~1 YEARS OF TORTURE; OR&#xD;
My wife said ~o more; but, sobbing all the while, she divested he~selt&#xD;
of her out door clotheS, put 7pn t~hose she us~zally wope, about the house,&#xD;
a~d went dowz~ stairs to attend to some domestic affairs.&#xD;
Meantime I retired to my study, ,or smoking room as I used to eall it,&#xD;
azid, lighting r~y 9igar, I flung myself on ~he lpung~, and, fiend that I&#xD;
was, actually luid there half the night levising by what plans and means&#xD;
I could torture my victim, wife. I felt at the time that I was possesed of&#xD;
the d~vil, and I gave my~e1f up to the dem9n with delight, instead of&#xD;
ti'ying to thr9w off th~ hideous influence.,&#xD;
It so happened t~s I lay thus studying my future action that I glanced&#xD;
up at a book ease containing a number of volumes. Among these I not-&#xD;
Iced One, entitled "The Tortures of the Spanish Inquisition," A moment&#xD;
more and, I was 'runn~n~ over the leaves of the book, gloating upon the&#xD;
engravings, especia1lytho~e whb~h showed the various eontriva~Ices that&#xD;
Weleused'in the Ir~qui8ition to extort confessions from its victims.&#xD;
"That's it I" I said gleefully to myself', and my only regret was th~t I&#xD;
could not devour the, horrid instruction at once with my eyes, and so be&#xD;
conversant with it by morning, when, I could begin to imitate it.&#xD;
After, sketching here and there~ through the, volume, and reading such&#xD;
paasr~ges as , particularly st~nck, my, fancy, I suddenly conceived the re-&#xD;
solution to go to bed, get a good long sleep, afid go at the book in the&#xD;
nipg~and study itfrom beginningt~ ei4 I ~id so, and early the sac&#xD;
feeding day I was at my wicked task with all the ardor of an enthusiast&#xD;
in ~ome good cause. As I read along through the book I wrote notes&#xD;
here and there in it at such places where I thought the poignancy of any&#xD;
toi~ture could be increased.&#xD;
In the rni~ldle of my ,work, Martha called me to breakfast and I went&#xD;
down to the meal actually in a good humor with her, from' the very fact&#xD;
that I was about, .~o s~ortiy to he able to inflict upon her the most hor-&#xD;
rible bqc~ly, tortures. ~ the progress 'of our breakfast I noticed my&#xD;
wife every r~ow and thea, glancing furtively at 'me when she thou~l4 I&#xD;
was npt looking at ~ier,&#xD;
"Wh4c~o you ~,tare at me s~ for?" inquired I' with a scowi.&#xD;
"Oh, James you do look so, strange about the, eyes, ~" replied my wife.&#xD;
"I am beginning, my dear, to be afraid of you; that you will, kUl me. It&#xD;
~ you do not love me any longer~~and~, do not want rue about you, pleas#&#xD;
tell ii~eeo plainly, ~nd I will ~o away and not be any more burden or&#xD;
tro~ible to you. ~&#xD;
A~a wy~ wif~'s words fell upon my ears, I, felt a chill of apprehension&#xD;
creep through rue, for the following reason. If I kept up my abuse other,&#xD;
she would perhaps run away-~-escape' froi~ m~ aztd I should lose m,&#xD;
tic~.zw,. IflStSfltly seeing this peril I determined to thwRrl4! Fore.&#xD;

SUTTEN'S DEATh BED CONFEBBION.                 IT&#xD;
thato come to ~ne. She did so pi~omptly, though I still noticed her ft~iu~&#xD;
her gaze upon my ey~s~ ,&#xD;
"My dear Martha," said I, passing my arm about her Wai~t, and draw-&#xD;
ing her uiwn my lap' "there is one secret of my life Ihave never told&#xD;
you though I ought to have done so before we got married. It is that &amp;amp;~&#xD;
times I have a ver~r bad temper. Now, deane,, I am going to make a&#xD;
strong and final effort to curb it and bring it under control. YQU believe@&#xD;
in praying Now I want you to pray for me. I an~ iu~earnest."&#xD;
I could always throw Martha completely off her guard by talking pious.&#xD;
ly to her.&#xD;
"Oh, dear James," indeed I wiU pray for you, night and day, in sea,&#xD;
son and out of season. Let us kneel here and together pray to the Throue&#xD;
of Grace."&#xD;
She kneeled down., So did I, and ta1~e hold of her ha~d whil? she pour.&#xD;
ed forth her pure heart in a most fervid appeal on my behaW Iurin~&#xD;
the whole time she was thus engaged I was coolly calculating how much&#xD;
torture she could endure without dying, and which kind of torture I&#xD;
should apply to her first.&#xD;
When we, arose I talked long and earnestly ~witb Martha in sue~ a&#xD;
way as to completely disurb.i her of any auspicioa that m~ previous con.&#xD;
duct might have aroused.&#xD;
oJe. now was to concoct some'p an; y which I could confine her&#xD;
My W't                             Lb&#xD;
~'1,1&#xD;
securely in the house so that it would be in~pos~ible for ,her to escape, an4&#xD;
yet account for her sudden disappearance satisfactorily to such of her&#xD;
church and other frien~s who ihight make inquiry concerning, her.&#xD;
This gave me a gr~at deal of trouble, and plan after plan did I cast&#xD;
aside as being no1~ spre, until I hit upon, the foPowing. I had some re.&#xD;
f~    natives inOhio, near Xenia. Mp~rtlia's health~ not neing yery good~ I per~&#xD;
suaded her to consent to make them, a visit, and I t~ok gooQ care to cir~&#xD;
eulate the intelligence amo~g~tbe peo~pJe~of the Church, aud invited every&#xD;
one I saw to join ue in a farewelltea party; in fact did a~1 ip my power&#xD;
to make the affair as noticeable as possible.&#xD;
Meantime I gradually apx~ secretly purchased suitable lumber and car-&#xD;
penters' and m~chh~ists' t6ol~, all of which I con v~yed to the upper rooms&#xD;
of this hou~e. When I say secretly I~ncan so far as refuted to any neigh..&#xD;
hors; for of course I could not copcctd these things from in~ *ife. But&#xD;
of course I secw'~d he~' silence easily b#' imifo~rning h~rthaV I wished t~&#xD;

t~ention to minutiae as you will see,. 'and as each part played along into&#xD;
the next, just like the tooth of a perfectly calculated ~ogw'he&amp;amp;l works into&#xD;
its counter, I actually rubbed my hands with glee.&#xD;
Toward the middle of the evening's entertainment I took up a salver&#xD;
of glasses containing nn~si~at wine. My wife took another, she serving&#xD;
the gentlemen and I the ladies. I had taken care to count the guests&#xD;
and" glasses and filled" several more than was necc~sary of the latter.&#xD;
After we had coxnpletA. the tour of'tbe room, I adroitly dropped a small&#xD;
powder into one of my glasses unseen by any person.&#xD;
"Now, then, Martha," said I, "Jet you and I exchange a; glass of&#xD;
Wine~ Here is one for you, and you give me one of yours.'&#xD;
I took th~poWdered glass'froin m~ salver and put it in my wife's fiand;&#xD;
she took one from hers and handed it to me.&#xD;
"Now, dear," continued I, passing my arm through Martha's in such&#xD;
a way that they interlocked, "you shall give the toasL."&#xD;
"Then it shall be this," replied she, "Here's to all our dear friends,&#xD;
present and absent. May love ever attend th~in and sorrow never come&#xD;
to any of them."&#xD;
"Especially may that be the happy fate of our beloved sister, Mrs.&#xD;
Sutten I" added one of the guests 'as the toast was being drunk.&#xD;
About half an ~hour later my wife came to m~ and complained of feel-&#xD;
tug very strange and unwell, and said she would have to go up to her&#xD;
room. My plan was working most admirably. Excusing her for a few&#xD;
minutes and enjoining our friends to enjoy themselves, I led Martha up&#xD;
stairs to her room, and assisted her gently to lie down upon the bed.&#xD;
Immediately I bounded ,out upon the staircase to see if all was clear.&#xD;
~o one was about. I rushed back, hastily raised my now half insensible&#xD;
*ife in my arms andwith unnatural strength bore her into the upper&#xD;
?oom, at the far end of which by means of long oaken scantlings I had&#xD;
~onAti'ucted a c6xiinplet~ cage. Into this I thrust her, locked the door,&#xD;
~nd then hurried 'sack into her bedroom, taking especial good care to also&#xD;
locI~ the door of the roomccii.~taining the cage.&#xD;
As I passed through my wife's apartment I placed upon her dressing&#xD;
table a note which I had prepared during the day, handwritten in a hand&#xD;
so like her own that no expert CQUld tell the difference. I then returned&#xD;
to the parlor, and explained to our guests that Mrs. S~itten would come&#xD;
sown in a few minutes, as she was only troubled' with a slight vertigo&#xD;
to which she was subject but which never lasted long at a time.&#xD;
An hour went on, and, as Mrs. Sutten had not yet made her promised&#xD;
reappearance, somebody suggested that.Mr. Sutten should go up and as~&#xD;
certain if she were better&#xD;
I selected the most intimate one of Martha's female acquaintances, and&#xD;
Invited her to go up with me, as a woman's hand was often most servi-,&#xD;

I. gloated oyer this horrible invention of the darh age~, and, when I&#xD;
bad completely mastered its details, I set myself about the task of tuak,&#xD;
ing one. Going up stairs, I ent~rcd the' gage, in which 1 kept ~Iar~ha;&#xD;
and measured her head with a tape measure. Since the struggle I ha~&#xD;
had with her, on the day she tried to escape, she had regained her origin.&#xD;
al humility and resignation to, her fate. Her viol~uee on that occ~siop&#xD;
resulted, I tiiinl~, from the effects of the narcotic I bad administered to&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Oh, James," she now pleaded, as I passed the tape roupd her head,&#xD;
"what are you gojog to do to me? Why are yo~ taking.the. dimepsioua&#xD;

"I. am going to make you a nice, new bonn~y" ~replie~ I, with a l9ugb,&#xD;

"Idon't want you to die, yet awhile any way! '~ ~&#xD;
measuring, "I don't want you to die till I am done with you."&#xD;
"James, please let me go awayfrotn you,. ~yliere you will never seems&#xD;

TR~I YEARS OF TORTURE;' OR&#xD;
appetite for giving her pain and torture. With an awful oath, that I&#xD;
will not repeat' to you, Bishop, 1~ pushed my poor wife from 'me, causing&#xD;
her to fall heavily on her side, and I exclaimed with' rancour:&#xD;
"Let you go, eb? Send you away from me so that I shall never see&#xD;
you again. Oh, no, that would be depriving myself of the only pleasure&#xD;
I have! No, lnd~ed)' you casting hypocrite,' I married 'you for the ex-&#xD;
press 'purpose of t~srturing you to death. 1 have gone to' every expense,&#xD;
to make my arrangements complete. 'You are doomed; tuind I tell yen!&#xD;
You will never get beyond this teem. Rest assured of that. I hate&#xD;
your chanting Chrisianity!"&#xD;
"Oh, James, hav9 mercy upon me! be pitiful to me!" still pleaded&#xD;
Martha.&#xD;
"Not a whit' of mercy!" sneered 1, "not a whit. 'i've made up my&#xD;
mind, that you shall suffer! Ha! ha! you shall be a rn~i~tyr, and I'll&#xD;
make up a new edition of Fox's Book of Martyrs, and will immortalize&#xD;
you and pass your name into history!"&#xD;
When I said this, Mart~ha looked steadily at me for 'a moment or so,&#xD;
and then,' in a voice, whose' strange, saintly accents haunt my ears now,&#xD;
said solemnly:&#xD;
"James' Sutten,' I an~ a poor, weak woman, without a human friend.&#xD;
You are a ~trorxg' man, rich land with many friends; but I have One, who&#xD;
~will not forsake me in my hour of trial. Blessed be His Holy ~ame, He&#xD;
will not tutu away His Face from me.' All I can do is to submit to your&#xD;
4~orture, if you are wicked enough ~ apply 'it. You may rack and destroy&#xD;
~i4 frail bOdyr but my' so~il is beyond your power. My spirit, when loos..&#xD;
~d from the clay, Will' 'ascend to Heaven, I hope, and be at rest forever&#xD;
more."&#xD;
She then fell upon her knees, and, raising her hands to Heaven, mur-&#xD;
mured:   '     I&#xD;
Oh my Heavenly Father, if I mtist drink of this Cup, giYe me, i&#xD;
httmbly beseech Thee strength to bear up. Not my will but Thino be&#xD;
done."             '~'     '                        '&#xD;
With an oath I left my victim, with hell's malice rankling 'in my wick-&#xD;
ed heart, and, going down stairs, got charcoal, made a fire in a portable&#xD;
furnace, and commenced at once to manufacture the "brank." Being&#xD;
particularly handy about mechanical contrivances, I succeeded very well&#xD;
in my job, and after nearly a day's steady labor, I finished the instrument'&#xD;
of~torture~ I could scarcely wait till tbe lirank was cool, before I ran&#xD;
with ittomy wife's eage, to try it on her. In order tb prevent her es-&#xD;
eape4o~n4b~ cage~i bolted the doorof it, i~hen I ivent in.&#xD;
"Here! ~ said I~ with ~ demon's grin en my face, "here's your boimet.&#xD;

~ .ie beheld the dreadful thing, she begged me to spare her. But there&#xD;
wasp no mercy in my soul. I got hold of~her by the neck, dragged 'her&#xD;
in the middle of the cage floor, and, holding her between my knees, forc-&#xD;
ed the brank over her heed, shut the fly pieces 'together with the Serew;&#xD;
and g~we the latter a twist. The agony this ~twisL gave ~ny toot' victim&#xD;
wife, must have been terrible; for her ~whoIe frame gbuddered, her eyes&#xD;
became lustreless, her faco changed white 28' warble, the l;erspiration&#xD;
sprang out in heads at every pores and she uttered the most aiVfal moans.&#xD;
Taking out my watch, I stood and watched my victim for ten minutes,&#xD;
with all the ferocity of a ti~er. She went dawn' on her knees to me,&#xD;
wrung her hands, shook her head and'pointed to the iron helmet, begging&#xD;
me in her pain, to relieve her. Fludhig at the end of ten minutes that&#xD;
she was likely to faint, if not speedily released, I undid the screw and re-&#xD;
moved thebrank. All she said, when I did so, was:&#xD;
"Oh! Oh!"&#xD;
Then she sank down upon th~ floor in the corner, bui~iod her face in&#xD;
her hands and cried bitterly, 'while there I stood laughing like a very"&#xD;
fiend at her mental anguish and physical torturc.~ "Presently she raised&#xD;
her head aud said piteously:&#xD;
"Oh, James, give me some Cold water, j~t a little cold water."&#xD;
"To he sure I will," replied I, and, going out' of the 'cage, I' got a&#xD;
tumbler of water and brought it back to her. She drank it ofT at a&#xD;
draught, but looked intently ~at~ a white powder-like sediment in the bot-&#xD;
tom of the glass and then looked' at' me. I burst into a loud laugh, and&#xD;
exclaimed:&#xD;
"What are you gaping at? " That's pure st~ych~ ne&#xD;
"Then I thank you' for it," said 'she, in reply "f3r I shall now be soon&#xD;
out of your road forever."&#xD;
"Ha! ha!" roared I, "you can keep' 'your thanks for so'     bCt~.&#xD;
ter. That is ~iot strychnine but only a little gl~iping stuff, that will give&#xD;
you some pain, but do you no injury."&#xD;
"James! James! 'I hope God will forgive you for this studied cruciltv&#xD;
to me. Surely you must be tinder the 'control of some fiend, to behave so&#xD;
to me, who have never done yen any harm."&#xD;
"Bab! "' I sneered, "the Devil himself 'and I are' tl;e best' of friends.&#xD;
He always takes, care of me.&#xD;
Here the dying' man was ~again seized with a terrible we:~kne~s~Azi&#xD;

After my 'poor wife had drt~n~ the~,water, eh~ became convulsed with&#xD;
the most terrible pains in the stomach, and holding herself with her hands,&#xD;
~he rolled Qver the floor, groaning and ,scroarning&#xD;
"NQne of~yorir. screaming now i~" ~xclahped I, seizing the brankin my&#xD;
hand threateningly, "none otyour singing those psalms; or on goes your&#xD;
iron night cap!"&#xD;
Martha turned her eyes up to me, as much as to say that she would&#xD;
obey me, and not scream out, and ~he thereafter only groaned heavily.&#xD;
Be, after standing in the cage a short time, ii went out, closed and fasten..&#xD;
ed the door, and with a final warning to rny'wife, to make no loud iiAses,&#xD;
and a~ threat to put the hrank ~u her; I left the room and went down&#xD;
stairs,&#xD;
Dressing myself, in my out door costume, I fastened up the house in&#xD;
the most. secure manner, and strolled off toward the city, where I' spent&#xD;
the rest of the night in debauchery, with the exception that I was careful&#xD;
not to drink any' intoxicating liquor. I had a constant" dread df liquor,&#xD;
for fear it might at some time overpower 'no, cause me to expose my daily&#xD;
wickedness, and thus rob me of my' victim.&#xD;
I. arrived back home just before daybreak, and~ entering the' house I&#xD;
bounded up stairs to the "Cage room,. '~ as I used to. call this apartment~&#xD;
When I went in, I flashed a 'dark lantern npoa the cage. My wife. was&#xD;
lying upon the floor in the corner of the enclosure~ She did not move,&#xD;
when the glare of the lantern fell upon her upturned face, and. a fearcame&#xD;
over, me that.she 'was~ dead ~t ast-~-all too soowfor thesatisfaetioa of~my&#xD;

cookery books.&#xD;
I took all these vianda, together with a bottle of wine, upstairs, and&#xD;
spread it forth upon a table in the cage room, in sight of my victim, whose&#xD;
eyes glistered. at the sight with all the longing of a half starved person.&#xD;
When I had got the meal all ready~, the Devil prompted me to let it stand&#xD;
thus within sight' of pooi' bungi~y Martha, and not allow her to eat a&#xD;
n~orsel; thus affording myself the d4~light of a new species of torture&#xD;
3314 t dreaded, as I havfi before told you, that if I inflicted too much upon&#xD;
her,' she would break down and die. So I resolved to take her out of the&#xD;
cage and let her enjoy the breakfast. I could at least inflict mental pain.&#xD;
at the&#xD;
Sitting down       table myself, I deliberately uttered a mock grace&#xD;
over the various dishes. Then rising, I address~ my wife with the&#xD;
words:&#xD;
"Now~ if I let you out of that cage, to get your breakfast, will you be-&#xD;
have yourself and walk back into the cage, as s6on as you have done,&#xD;
like a good convict?"&#xD;
"I will, .Thmes, '~ replied&#xD;
"[Very ~vdl, then, come otit,'and eat as much as you want to."&#xD;
As I spoke, I drew back the bolt, opened the cage door and let Martha&#xD;
walk from the cage to the table. Though so excessively hungry, my wife&#xD;
y~as in such dread' of me,'that, before tukin~ her 'Scat at the table, ~he&#xD;
turned round and looked at me to see, if I approved. I nodded assent,&#xD;
and she sat'down'iuid conimen&amp;amp;~d' to eat. During the meal I did not in-&#xD;
terfere with her; but took a sort of grim delight, in calculating, how much&#xD;
strength she would gain by the food; she' ~o voraciously swalIow.ed~ and,&#xD;
as a result how much mor ~Pire sh6'w'6uld'be able to undergo without&#xD;
d'yin~'. It 'took her fully three fourths of.an hour to satisfy her appetite,&#xD;
and then she rose and said:&#xD;
"Must I g~ back into' the' cage,' James?"&#xD;
"You must, my darling sugar plum ~f Christian sweetness!" rejoined&#xD;
I, with gruel, delil~erate' emphasis.&#xD;
Martha said ii~ more, 114 ~v'aiked straight back into her former abode&#xD;
"May ~ h~v~' a chair dr'st661 t~ sit 4~wn' upon; James?"&#xD;
"Yes, ~you~ m~y, my pious~ p~i hypocrite, " '~h~*~' Is one, ~' and I band-&#xD;
d'her ~ ~ '7' az~d 'tp~' '~ii~k~ ~ situation cbmpletelv comfortable, you&#xD;

&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
BUTThN'S DEATH DED CONFESSION.&#xD;
to yourself. And you shall have plenty to eat and drink, three good,&#xD;
square meals a day." '&#xD;
Martha looked at me, as though within herself she were. saying:&#xD;
"I wonder what fearful thing this man is preparing for me now." But&#xD;
wisely enough, she said nothing except:&#xD;
"I will thank you truly for your kindness, dear James."&#xD;
Quickly I got all the articles~ of furniture I had 'mentioned, and placed&#xD;
them in the cage. They nearly filled it up. I then locked the deor, so&#xD;
that my prisoner should not escape, and, going to my bedroom, I went. to&#xD;
bed 'and slept soundly till past three o'clock thatafternoon. Upon awaken~&#xD;
ing, I rose and prepared supper for myself, and also for Martha. lle~&#xD;
appetite was scarcely Ies~ than at hraakfast~&#xD;
I h~d made up my mind to feed. my wife well, for a week or two, by&#xD;
which time she would, I calculated, he strong enough for me to recom~&#xD;
mence my torturing upon her.&#xD;
SUTTEN RENEWS HIS CRUELTIES,&#xD;
I kept up my "kind treatment," as I called it,,of my wire, for over&#xD;
three weeks, by which time I had completely restored her strength anj&#xD;
health, It was on a Sabbath morning that I recommenced my iniquitous&#xD;
cruelties upon my poor wife., ~She~had just finished her breakfast, whichi&#xD;
I had brought to her, and she had pu~e~ui~ed to pray aloud for me iu my&#xD;
hearing. This enraged me to active hostilities. In the midst of her&#xD;
prayer I seized the brank, flung back the swin~higpiee~, clapped it upon&#xD;
Martha's head, and gave the screw a fierce turn, As she had her eyes&#xD;
Closed, at the time, arid wns completely interested in her devotioius, ~he&#xD;
was thoroughly unconscious of the approaching assault, until the instru~&#xD;
i~uent of torture~Was secured upon her head.&#xD;
On this occasion she did, not swoon as before, but leaped up and stag.&#xD;
gered into 'the cage, whcre she,, clutched 4 the scantling bars in great&#xD;
agony; but ~be di~1 notlook' towards n~e pleadingly, asahe did the other&#xD;
time. This b~avery'and enclur4nco of h~ra rendered rue exceedingly furl.&#xD;
ous, and, rushing after her into the cage, I seized ,the serew'h~ndle',an~&#xD;
~gave it a fresh turn. It was too mi~ch, however, and, v~rithont a groan,&#xD;
my wifa fell lnsen~ible to the floor. I quickly removed tho brank, heft&#xD;
the cage, and locked her 'in, to recover when she might.&#xD;
I was m~~ch chagrined to find my iron bonnW thus ~'faiIuro. Them I&#xD;
began' to think it. over, ~nd.cn~nAe to thp ~o~clu5in, that it.wd~iPI he more&#xD;
sn~cessful as ~ tor1t~ire, ,to merely ~unke Martha wear it eohtinuall~r, and,'&#xD;
be careful, not to turn on the Screw~ ~o tightly ~t any onetime. ' Sub~'q..&#xD;
quently I used to keep Vhe brapk, on my wife for six and ~eve~i daya at: 4&#xD;

PE~ YJ~ARS ~OF 'DOILTURII; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
After she had lain, insensible for about an ., slowly began&#xD;
hour she&#xD;
to recover. I t~hereupon entered the cage, and removed, evt~ry article of&#xD;
furniture I had. p1~ced there, with the exception of the 4esk'a~id chair.&#xD;
M~ idea for leaving the~n there~ was to allow her to write down her&#xD;
thoughts from time to time, as I thought the perusal thereof would afford&#xD;
me a great deal ofamtzsem&amp;amp;nt.&#xD;
I zio~V begau~ 'to invent ne~ tortures. I remembered that my 'rife had&#xD;
a 'mostr terrible aversion to monkeys, and, posting down to Baltimore I&#xD;
purchased the moSt repulsive looking brute of the Moi~key tribe that 1&#xD;
ever SaW. Qarrying~ it home, I took it up stairs, and, turned it loose in&#xD;
the room, in which the c~ge Was constt'uoted.&#xD;
Of course the creature could not get o~it, and 'being so much frighten~&#xD;
'~d~ it boun4e~I ±6un4 the artm~ei~t, when I let it loose, like a wild little&#xD;
ffen~d. 12t.s ~es' 'gla~d, aud it enteredd the most. frightful shrieks and&#xD;
screams. If it was scared, Martha was perfectly terrified. As I had the&#xD;
brank upon her head, she could not scream; but she groaned continually,&#xD;
her eyes seemed ready to burst from her head, and she stared at the&#xD;
monkey steadily, like one fascinated. Every motionr~ that thc animal&#xD;
would zpake~ Marth . also moved correspondingly. Her dread seemed to&#xD;
~1.'o4'&#xD;
~e, ~h~t~the ~teS1~retvould get ~ the spaces between the scantlings&#xD;

~~J~w~uId ~eream' hide~u~l~, stud i'airly fly around the room. clinging&#xD;

~een~ed dis~osed to avoid Martha as well as myself; but finally the beast&#xD;
nppeai'ed to ~e~1ize that she, like' itself, was i~ distress; and, darting into&#xD;
the cage, &amp;amp;ok tefnge directly ben~ah bet' desk.&#xD;
Martha moaned ~iteously, and, crowding herself back close against the&#xD;
ecantlii~, ~he clasped her trembling hands iii supplication to me, and&#xD;
pointin~g at ~he monkey, made signs 'begging me to remove it.&#xD;
"T~4~9 away your dear little' brOther frdm you?" laughed I; ":why&#xD;
~ ep~d not deprive you of all your company. That monkey's are-&#xD;
He         'be  parson: in the island of Oevlon. Th&#xD;

Martba stamped her foot and shook her head violently as mueh as to&#xD;

"Do it! I don't care!"&#xD;
"You say, that you did not elopefrom me, and that you did nbt~ ia&#xD;

comic air. "Why, I can prove it to you! All your acquaintances mind&#xD;

you ran away on the night cf the. party."&#xD;
I took the letter from my pocket, but did not place it in Martha's hand&#xD;
'untd after I had narrated to 'her,. with every possible exag~ei~ation, the&#xD;
history of my plot in regard to her pretended' elopement~ T.his done, 'I&#xD;
handed her the note.&#xD;
She read it with eager avidity, crushed it in her hand, and then stood&#xD;
gazing at me like a person bewildered, for the space of at least tw.o mizi~&#xD;
utes. She then made a motion for me to take oft the brank.&#xD;
'Oh no," laughed I," you will be too noisy. '~ .. .~&#xD;
Sh~ shook her head that she would be quiet, and. so ~L removed it i~&#xD;

said was:                              " . '&#xD;

" Not a word of asking pardon comes from my lips to such a cQward&#xD;
monster as you! 'Do your worst! The sooner you kill me, the be~er!&#xD;
I say again, I will never forgive you for that!"&#xD;
The following moment I had clapped the iron brank over Martha's&#xD;
head, closed the swinging.picces, and was turning the screw, like a mad&#xD;
devil ~hat I 'was. My fury nearly robbed me of my victim; for aft~r one&#xD;
or two turns, my wife' fell to che ~oor ~t my ~ irpparentjy as 1dead, as&#xD;

-                1~EARLY STARVED TO DEATH.&#xD;
During the next ten days I adopted' a new species of torture. I ob-&#xD;
tamed some ~hips of the quassia wood, anSI ground prickly ash bark.&#xD;
*Pu'tting these into a large stone jug, I filled 'the latter with water nearly&#xD;
to the top, and then added about a gill of pure alcohol. This I placed in&#xD;
Martha's cage, and gave her nothing else whatever to eat or drink for&#xD;
~three days. All the first day she would not touch it, moi~e especially be-&#xD;
cause the monkey several times stuck his paws 'into 'it, and jabbered, when&#xD;
he licked the hitter drink off them. But about midnight Martha's thirst&#xD;
became so intolerable, 'that she was obliged to take a sip or two. Its&#xD;
bitterness was disagreeable at first to her, but her palate soon becoming&#xD;
'~sed to that, ~he dr~~nk more largely of it each successive time, that she&#xD;
grew thirsty. Of courSe, UI)Ofl her empty stomach, this intensely power-&#xD;
'ful 'tonic and appetizer speedily took effect, and on the second day, toward&#xD;
ev~ping, Martha became ravenously hungry. To all her appeals for food&#xD;
I told ker to go to the stone jug. In order also to add additional pangs&#xD;
:to her sufferings, I cooked the most delicious and' savory articles of food,&#xD;
That I could think of. I drew the table just near enough to the cage to&#xD;
be two inches or so beyond the utmost reach of my ~ hand, when&#xD;
tlirtist out between the scanthing bars.&#xD;
Spre~dinp' the cloth, I would sit down and serve up two plates, o~&#xD;
saucers, or dishes of everything that I had cooked. Each of these I.&#xD;
would devour myself with every tani alizing expression I could think ~f,&#xD;
such as:&#xD;
~,Well, upon my soul, my dear, this the 'most juicy, tender hit of beef-&#xD;

had so nearly burned out,-b&amp;amp;side which there was no pond nor stream&#xD;

the flames, but allowed them to finiab' their work of destruction. It would&#xD;

experienced'such mental agitation as I. did on that eve~itful night~&#xD;
THE CONTENTS OF THE MANUSCRIPT OBTAINED BY THE BISH~P.&#xD;
&#xD;
For sometime after his arrival at home, the Bishop was sorely per;v1ex~&#xD;
~d whether he should at once make his singular adventure public, or* let'&#xD;
it die out. After giving the s~Ibj~ct prayerful consideration, beeonclAudedl&#xD;
that it would be most advisable to allo~v the affair to remain asit' 1.hOTlA&#xD;
was, until such time as he' could give it proper pu~ilication.A The nlann.i&#xD;
script upon being examined by the Bishop, was found' to be a eoin~te&#xD;
detailed history or confession ~f Sutten~s act of persecution and'torture'of&#xD;
his unfortunate wife, together with descriptions of the various machineW&#xD;
and instruments, which he had constructed for his hellish purpose; There'&#xD;
was. also a sort. of diary, or 'rather jottings down of thoughts and lteehio~S!&#xD;
bsr the poor' wife. Some of her writing was most hearttoucbing'aiid'itui&#xD;
perusal caused the Bishop to shed tears: It is given further on; It' will~&#xD;

&#xD;
increasing or decreasing coldness of the temperature, and noticing what&#xD;
kind of clothing her husband ~vore~ Beyond this she was actually no-&#xD;
thing mQre' than a.living corpse.&#xD;
The only portion of the narrative left written by Sutten, which we omit&#xD;
in the succeeding pages, is that part, giving substantially what the dying&#xD;
manimparted orally to the Bishop: on his deaLli bed. Evidently Sutten,&#xD;
wben he commenced the history, was the subject of the most poignant&#xD;
remorse for what he had done to his wife.&#xD;
THE WRITTEN CONFESSION.&#xD;
"What a frigbtftil night I have passed! :If I trust myself to think&#xD;
for a moment upon the events of the last ten years, I seem like a monster&#xD;
whom~Satan, in 'companion, becomes. an innocent lamb. She has gone&#xD;
to her reward, ~my poor, persecuted, murdered wife I Oh, Martha! angel&#xD;
that you were, and now sainted spirit that you are, can you be looking&#xD;
down up~n me now? Yes! yes! I can see your sweet, forgiving face&#xD;
beating upon me, your. double-dyed guilty 'murderer. There is' no fury&#xD;
in your eye, no hate~upon your countenance. All is love! all is forgive-&#xD;
ness4 Oh, what is 'to become of. me? Though the mountains and rocks&#xD;
were to fall upon me and crush me, my conscience would still torment&#xD;
me'th~ same 'as it does' now. Though all the billows of the ocean were to&#xD;
roll over 'me, they could not quench one jot li'or title of the fiery agony&#xD;
that is consuming me.&#xD;
I dread 'to call upon God for forgiveness, for He would surely destroy&#xD;
me at once' for my presumption. I have heard so much and so often of&#xD;
the forgiveness of the sins of the worst of malefactors. But when or&#xD;
where' was there ever such a malefactor as I? Not in all history! Judas,&#xD;
w'i~o'betrayed his Holy 'Master was not as bad as I have been. lie corn-&#xD;
mitted his one enormous crime of the betrayal, while I have been guilty&#xD;
of a series of enormous crimes for ten long, darksome years on God's&#xD;
handmaiden.' Had I been an ignorant, outcast heathen, there might be&#xD;
annie .sl)adow of excuse for me. But instead of that, I was the child of&#xD;
God's household, brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.&#xD;
The' bri~ht' sun of righteousness was constantly illumining my wsy, so&#xD;
that my feet ought not to have slipped nor my steps gone astray. Then&#xD;
again our Saviour, when 'speaking of ministering to the wants of even a&#xD;
little child,.He uses 'the language,' '~' And even as ye did it unto one of&#xD;
these little ones, ye did it 'unto me. ~' That referred to the mere act of&#xD;
givia~: a child a cup of cold 'watek'. 'The Master intended to show that&#xD;
*~6u so small a kindness ,'done to a:little child, would be remembered&#xD;
favorably to the giver' 'and would be looked upon, in the same light as&#xD;
tk~ugh the leed had bQwa' .dono4o Ulniacif.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
E&#xD;
&#xD;
Now then,, if that be true, must not thereverse be also true? If a wick.&#xD;
ed man had refused .toa little. thirsty child a cup of cold water, 'wotild it&#xD;
not be remembered against him?. The Master Himself certainly neant&#xD;
so, when He uttered the words: "Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these&#xD;
ii We ones, ye did it not to me."&#xD;
How then c~n I dare to priLy to God for forgiveness:after'rny ten years&#xD;
of blasphemy and horrible 'wi&amp;amp;kedness,. and bloody, worse than Pagan&#xD;
'cruelty? Yet sometimes I think, God's power to forgive is cei'taialy co-&#xD;
equal with. His power to ~uni'sh. With 'fear and trenil)liug I register my&#xD;
vows l)efore Heaven, to humbly spend the remainder of my days, be they&#xD;
many or few, in contrite sell-inflicted, suffering and repentance for the past.&#xD;
Aii~l it may be, t:hat; in His Gr~t Mercy, my Heavenly Father may vet&#xD;
vouchsafe meWs forgiveness4&#xD;
Pray for me, spirit of my murdered Martha I.. my martyred wife!&#xD;
Oh.my fellow men, who may read this narrative, you will see by read.&#xD;
ing how a man may f&amp;amp;ll under the dominion and power of the Devil, by&#xD;
yielding too easily to the first temptation. The Arch Destroyer of souls&#xD;
does not take possession of you all at once, for then His presence would&#xD;
be so hideous th~t he. would be forthWith driven away. But he first gets&#xD;
one foot on the threshold, 'and so 'grad uall~ Wdrks his~way into youi~ soul,&#xD;
until he becomes your master and you cannot eject him; '&#xD;
At first I ha~ intended tolet all my hdrrible deeds, committed in~secre-&#xD;
cy, so far as human. obsei~vati~n ~vent, die out with myself, ~td 'riot per-&#xD;
petuate by recordingtheni. But I' have changed 'my mind on thr~t" point,&#xD;
and have determined to tell them to my fellow beings, to show what a&#xD;
tearful demon a wicked.. wan may become by giving his l)USCI' passions&#xD;
full sway over him. I"know . you will curse me as you reacI~ butyo~&#xD;
cannot curse ~me worse than I have often cursed myself since my con-&#xD;
science roused m~'.to.'a.fult appreciation ofwhat I had been guilty of.&#xD;
Here the narrative begins, anJ we omit all of the first portion as fimras&#xD;
$utten got in his recital t.o the l3isjrop.&#xD;
I was obliged tO use a vast. amoumit of precaution in giving Martha&#xD;
food after having starved herso completely during th~ 1)revious't~'n~day~&#xD;
for, had I allowed her as. much, or even half as much, Ss her l'avenofls&#xD;
appetite would have impelled her to' eat, she would have died, within&#xD;
twenty-four hours.       ..' .       . .       .&#xD;
Therefore I made her some moderately st!o~ig . beef tea and broke tip&#xD;
two ounces of sailor's biscuit: in ohe gill ';~nd'a 'half of the tea. ~"This I&#xD;
gave her in the x~o~n1ngthen'the sahie atintervals of.fourKh~iitts for t~6&#xD;
days with an occasionall ~sip of 'te~ sngar~'.knd wate~, 'or. coffee: between&#xD;
times. On .the third day I gave her some fresh bread and a small 'tiuit.'&#xD;
ton chop rear-done. with.~ .snm~l'l giass; of'tn~u~cat Wine l~rorn day to day&#xD;
I increased. thQ quantity of food tl)us gradually until 'I had h~ health&#xD;

powerft4 indeed, that ~within one month after I had commenced to re&#xD;
~upprate tier physical powers, she was as strong and healthy as she used&#xD;
to b~ previously.&#xD;
Pouring all this time she. did not cease to pray almost continually, that&#xD;
God would change my heart and send inea new spirit. This used to&#xD;
make me frightfully angry; but I concealed my rage, because I' was&#xD;
afraid that if 1 attempted any further infliction of corporeal torture upon&#xD;
Martl~, she Would succumb under it, aria so' deprive me of any further&#xD;
pleasure. I used to sit like a grim demon, grinding my~ teeth, and con-&#xD;
* soling myself, tbat~ after awhile, when she was stronger, I would make&#xD;
herf si~ffer four. fQld worse for. herprayers.&#xD;
* Every day saw me working with hand' and brain upon some infernal&#xD;
mechanical contrivance, which would inflict a maximum amount of agony&#xD;
with a mininium amount of destructiveness upon the human frame.&#xD;
~Wbile I was engaged in bringing my poor wife's 'health and strength&#xD;
hack again, I worked most of the time in the lower part of the house as I&#xD;
did not wish to have my object delayed by such mental torture and wor~&#xD;
riment as her seeing me thus at workwould have produced. But after&#xD;
she was well, it gave ~me a kitid of advance pleasure-if I may use such&#xD;
a teriw,-4o let Martha behold me thus making the~ hideous preparations&#xD;
for her torture.&#xD;
In. addition to the monkey, that I had bought for the purpose of tern-&#xD;
fying1~artha, I caught two enormous frogs, which I also shut up in the&#xD;
room; where the cage was. These' reptiles were in truth most horrible&#xD;
looking monsters, although of course perfectlyharmless. I got a small&#xD;
wooden tank of water, which I placed close to Martha's cage, and in this&#xD;
[threw the frogs, after showing them to my wife.&#xD;
The creatures no sooner .obtained their liberty, than they leaped about&#xD;
in all directions, all' over the' room, avoiding, however, both myself and&#xD;
Martha..&#xD;
"They are a little shy, yet, my dear," said I, as 1 thr~w them down,&#xD;
but when they get to know you well~ why, theywill become as affection-&#xD;
ate, as two i'abhits; they'll jump in your lap, and on'your' head, and kiss&#xD;
yoi, ai~d if you'll only op~ii your' mouth wide' enough when you. pray,&#xD;
they'll jump down your' throat. Then kigain they are most' magnitleent&#xD;
singers, and when your monkey missionary gives ou~ a 'hymn or psalm~&#xD;
tb~se two fellows will hell) you 'to' sing most' gloriously~&#xD;
* "And that reminds me, that. you haven't seen your little missionary&#xD;
for a couple of days Just wait till I fetch him. I have been getting a&#xD;
suit of ~loth~s for him ;. one thatisa ilice fit and that~ becomes him' sphn~&#xD;
didly4'&#xD;
I wentor~t of:the room .aniV returned' v~hith the monkey, dressed hr the&#xD;

Pre~etitly he saw dt~ of'th&amp;amp;' frogs~ ~he~i th~ 'otber~ and at once heg~n&#xD;
to show symptoms of' gi~eat ~xcFWz~ient~ To' increase' thia excitement I&#xD;
went toward the'fro~s~ and witha stick drove them toward the cage. The&#xD;
horrid looking creatures would not~go~ into the cagebtit bounded ami&#xD;
leaped against the bars. It would be difficult totell which was the most&#xD;
deplorably teri4fled~ uly Wife Martha, or the monkey.&#xD;
M'arthai got into one corner 'of'tbe cage, wringing her handa and'groan'&#xD;
ing. She would have'scre~med loudly, no doubt; b~xt 'f~ri'eav, that' ifabe&#xD;
did, I w'ould~.put th~ brank on' her head~&#xD;
The monkey, that I had named John 'Wesley~ would' watch e~ry' mot&#xD;
tion of the frogs, ah'd~' as fast as either made a' leap, the monk4 woi~ld&#xD;
jump from spot to ~pot~ and fr~m bar: to bar of the cage, uttering each&#xD;
time a shrill, ~aPspliVting shriek 'or'cry like that oPa human being. The&#xD;
cunning. creature' noticed the 'fact that the frogs did not wish to g~t intO&#xD;
the cage, ~ad he~ therefore, would' not come ~uteidO. At last I succeed&#xD;
,r ed lh driving them close to' the bars, against which they~sprang. 1naktt~&#xD;
ly the monkey darted'iato' the same corner in which Martha was erouciP&#xD;
ing, and giVing vent to a serieS of his peculiar shrieks and sCrean~,"h~&#xD;
nestled himself down by her side, and endeavored to push himself1 in~ be.t&#xD;
hina her' for ~h4lter. This was.'e~actly[what I 'had'ezpected and h~en&#xD;
looking for~;' dnd'I yelled out: * " '&#xD;
'~ IiurrahMartha, for. your little 'missionary! lie isjust about as brave&#xD;
as rtiissionaries generally are." ' ,&#xD;
Martha uttered a sound which I could neither c~ll asere~m' nor a groan.&#xD;
It wusa kind)' of'~' sufl'ocatixlg, dreadful utterance of voice, for which'&#xD;
there can be no intelligible words of descnipti~n, but which' thoroughly'&#xD;

.~~ During all, this time the frogs had been leaping., round the room; but&#xD;

the very eyes of my victim' by the identical reptile that I had brought in&#xD;
to torture her with, "was what now rende~'ed me soifurious, and 'so, as' I&#xD;
caught sight of Martha looking at me with so much pity, I gnashed"nmy&#xD;
teeth, amid uttering a fearful, iinprocation, drew faek my .~trw, and flung&#xD;
the snake violently at my wife's.face.&#xD;
Coward that I was, I 'dreaded that the reptile. would renew its attack&#xD;
upon me, nad the moment, therefore, that Lfiung it away toward M~artba,&#xD;
I sprung back myself,' and jumped up on a. table to be ontof its reach.&#xD;

I could not 'tell; 'biit'thoughKl couid'notsee it, still neither could I hear&#xD;

THE iRON DOOT.&#xD;
In the volume describing the various instruments of torture which were&#xD;
used in the Spanish inquisition, I found a description of one that I took a&#xD;
Iancy to try upon~my wife.. It was called the Iron Boot. It wus made&#xD;
*f six iron. bands, each bent and fashioned iu such &amp;amp; way, that when all&#xD;
were' adjusted in tI~eir proper relirtiye positions, they formed a boot like&#xD;
that usually worn 'by men. 'Ait the toe, instep, and top of the leg part&#xD;
~vere set screws, by whIch a frightful compression could be made, causing&#xD;
t~he victim npou whom the boot might be puts to suffer the most exquisite&#xD;
torture.&#xD;
When I had' made np'my mind to apply this horrible torture to my'&#xD;
poor~ wife,, I ~et about the construction of the boot. I had already made&#xD;
several machines of torture, but had used 'none i4 th6rfl as' y'et&#xD;
Du~ing. all the time~I wa~ working upon the iron bott, Martha watched'&#xD;
me with dreadfully increasing intcr~st, but she did not attempt to inquire&#xD;
what it was.&#xD;
One day when I nearly, badit completed, I held it up and said:&#xD;
"Martha, guess what that ~ and who it is for.&#xD;
~ty'poor wif~,1ooked atth~ ,boot, then at rue; and, with fear ~nd sorrow&#xD;

would 'set in frQm the recent ~wsiter torture X Jad i~tlieted~on ~her, I took&#xD;

by Martha. She was very, ve1'.~ pale;' but not' a muscle trembled, even&#xD;
though.I held up the three frightful nallsfor her to 'look at.&#xD;

and so end 'hei' life of misery though her religious prevented her from raise'&#xD;
ing her ow'I~ hand to slay herself.., The moment I got this notion, I re*.&#xD;
solved to cheat her even of the poor pleasure of:a speedy death, and 80, 1'&#xD;

did not barry out my threat; jut, 'at th~ ~amo time, ~haV perfect trust she.&#xD;
had in' God, rendered her 'thoroughly calm and uui~x~ited ~at'her release&#xD;

with .all my p~wer on the ropes, and at last I could hear Martha's. joiiit~&#xD;

forcing a siiri~k of pain from her lips, at which&#xD;
I would laugh l~ik~ a fiend,~~ and address some vile expression and d~risive&#xD;

another turn on ~ither~ one of them, my wife's quivering limhs would have.&#xD;

book out of her feeble grasp, "I believe the best torture I can gi&#xD;
is this! Curse my soul, if I dou't!"&#xD;
With this awful expression on my lips, I kicked Martha's bibi&#xD;
across the room. Not satisfied with tbat, I bounded to the boc&#xD;
taking it up, deliberately tore it leaf from leaf, spit on it, threw it&#xD;
and ground it under my heel.&#xD;
Poor Martha wept bitterly, and put her hands over her eyes&#xD;
out the sight of my villainy. But she Aid not say unythiag to we.&#xD;
One day shortly after this aflair, T bought several pounds of&#xD;
snuff, and, taking it home, I threw the whole quantity over Marth&#xD;
ing previously thrown water over her. The effect of this dreadf&#xD;
cowardly attack was to nearly strangle my wife, and give her fr&#xD;
sickness, nausea and headaches for more than a week.&#xD;
THE END APPROACHES.&#xD;
But .1 cannot go on, giving full details of everything ~ did. It&#xD;
*                                     horrible. So let me hasten to the latter portion of the history.&#xD;
It had been nearly ten years since I married M~rtba Mort0n&#xD;
through my barbarous treatment she had been reduced from a&#xD;
jiandsome woman to a mere wreck~ During all that long, time not&#xD;
of love or affection had ever passed my lips to h~r, nothing but&#xD;
ribald, obscene balderdash anA blasphemy. I had tortured her in&#xD;
conceivable manner, going to every expense and trouble to invei&#xD;
construct diabolical machines for my horrid purpose. I had used&#xD;
one of these machines, tothe number of twentv~one, several times&#xD;
and my inventk.n had ~t last failed. I could make nothing ne~v.&#xD;
*   these had done their infernal work so well, that my poor wife was&#xD;
gone. She could no longer stand up nor walk about for atiy leni&#xD;
time; her breathing was broken *and short, her face was pale, a&#xD;
pale as marble, her cheeks hollow, and most of hc'rtoeth gone. I ha&#xD;
deliberately filed* many of her teeth, and then applied su~lphuric a&#xD;
them, so as to crumble them away and give her tooth a~he.&#xD;
I began in retdty DOW to wish my poor victim dead; and one nig&#xD;
I l~y in bed, I deliberately determined that the next mornih~ shoti&#xD;
~oiiip1i~h hei' death. For some hoi~'~ T'jorrnenled myself With ch&#xD;
by what t~teans or torture I should cap th~ (~lin1a± of my horrible ten&#xD;
V                 of cruelty a~nd (habolism. At last I deei~led to put my wife to dea&#xD;
means of the water drop on the hack of the head. Full of this S~&#xD;
determination, I rose at daylight the next morning and went to Ma&#xD;

E6              TEN YEARS OF TORTURE; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
~y design. But I did waver the moment Ii entered the room. Perhaps&#xD;
God had 'fixed the limit there, past which I was HOL to torture His saint&#xD;
~ny more. Never before, during all the previous tei~ years had I felt as&#xD;
Ii did that niorning, when this new sensation came over me. As the&#xD;
strange thrill went through~ me, I thought of the' manifestation of God's&#xD;
power to Saul of 'I'arsus, when that persecutor was on his way to destroy&#xD;
the children of the Lord.&#xD;
"God has strh~ken me through all the panoply of the Devil ! "' I gasp-&#xD;
as I sank trembling on the floor.&#xD;
Never was there a more terrified, abject wretch than I was at that iiio-&#xD;
ment. I wept, and cried, and g:'oaned. Martha had been asleep, but,&#xD;
'at the strange sounds, she started suddenly up, and gazed at me in pro-&#xD;
found wonder. As~ I -beheld her looking at me through the bars of her'&#xD;
cage, I exclaimed in my fearful agony:&#xD;
"Oh! Martha! Martha! Martha!"&#xD;
"What is it?" asked 'she, with anxiety in her voice, as with her wo-&#xD;
~ian's intuitive perception, she saw that I was in earnest.&#xD;
"What is it?" Oh'! that shall I do? what shall I do? God has&#xD;
laid His hand on me at last! What a guilty wretch have I been! Here,&#xD;
go free! go free! Leave this house, at once! Go down to the City, take&#xD;
out a warrant for me, a~id let me be arrested and punished! Punished'!&#xD;
Oh, Heaven! what punishment is there that man can inflict, which would&#xD;
be' adequate for the hellish sufferings I have inflicted upon you, my saint,&#xD;
my darling 'wife? Here, take this ~pistol and shoot me dead a.t your feet!&#xD;
'See, I am kneeling before you, Martha!"&#xD;
As I was uttering all these wild expressions, I leaped to my feet, hasti-&#xD;
ly undid the door of the cage, drew my pistol, and, falling on my knees,&#xD;
offered the weapon to Martha. Instead of using it, however,'~ my angel&#xD;
wife put it down upon her bed, and then, with a cry that I shall never&#xD;
forget, she kneeled 'before me, and, flinging her arms around my neck, she&#xD;
almost whispered, so intense was her new delight:&#xD;
"Thank Ood,~Jatnes! At lust! at last!"&#xD;
Then she burst f a flood of te~irs, and wept, and wept, till I thought&#xD;
her~heart would bre~k 'with joy. All ~he did, for almost half an hour,&#xD;
was to cry, and ~ and kiss me fondly. At last she became calm enough&#xD;
to talk, and then 'she said&#xD;
ae4J~h, my dear James, I have been praying so long, so long for this. I&#xD;
was afraid, I would die before you became convinced of the error of your&#xD;
ways. I was afraid I should b~ gone from you forever, before you would&#xD;
see fit to speak to' me one word ~f kindnt~ss, one syllable of loves 13ut,&#xD;
thank God, it has come at last, and I can die happy!"&#xD;
'Great Heaven, Martha!" exclaimed I, drawing my poor wire fondly&#xD;
to my b~som, "after all the heinous crimes I have committed against&#xD;
rou, after idi my blasphemy of your religion, how can you have aught&#xD;
&#xD;
SUTTEN'S DEATH BED CONFESSION.&#xD;
else than feelings of revenge and hatred? In return for my ten years of&#xD;
cruelties and tortures, how ct~n you have only these tender sentences of&#xD;
love?"&#xD;
"Why, no, certainly not, James. Uow cQuld 1, and be a follower of&#xD;
the Lord and Saviour, Jesus t~hrist?"&#xD;
For a long, time I 'could not speak; but sat silently fondling M~rtha~&#xD;
with all the childish fervor of a young lover., And she ,was equally as&#xD;
much affected as I was. The emotions that swiftly coursed after each&#xD;
other through my heart for the next hour, II could not begin to describe.&#xD;
The strongest, most fervid language I might conjure up, would be a thous-&#xD;
and fold too weak to paint theni.&#xD;
At last we~ both calmed down ~sufficiently to talk about the future.&#xD;
"The first thing I must do, Martha, is to make, reparatioii to you. Yoti&#xD;
must get well and strong again. Let me see, the tenth day of next month&#xD;
is the date ott which I gave that paxty, and invited all your friends 'and&#xD;
acquaintances here for the demon-like purpose of blasting your fair name;&#xD;
that I ought to have defended with my own life. No wonder that you&#xD;
said, you would, never forgive me for that."&#xD;
"Yes, but IL do, dear James; I do forgive you, even for that. Because&#xD;
ydu certainly would not have done it, if you had been in your right mind;"&#xD;
rejoined Martha, quickly interrupting me.&#xD;
"Well~" resumed I, "whether ,or not, I am going to invite all tho~&#xD;
self same persons here again on' the tenth, and, before them all, I shall&#xD;
confess my fault, my wickecfness toward you.&#xD;
"Never, James, shall you do such a thing. I would not have any one&#xD;
know that you did it;" hastily rejoined my noble wife. "No," continu-&#xD;
ed she, "I shall not live long, and, while I live, I do not 'wish to re-enter&#xD;
society. The few friends I had, doubtless consider me dead and gone,&#xD;
and so let me remain to them-among the departed. Your love for the&#xD;
rest of my short days is all I ask."&#xD;
"But what shall I say if any of them happen to see you?" asked I.&#xD;
"Tell them that I came back to you, that you and I:a~e friends again,&#xD;
and not to ask you an~ more questions About it."&#xD;
"Oh, my dearest Martha, you are, indeed, a faithful Christian. Yot~&#xD;
are really a true disciple and follower of the Saviour of mankind. But&#xD;
oh, my darling, when I think of the hprrid blasphemy of which I have&#xD;
been guilty, to say nothing of my frightful persecutions of youself, I fe4&#xD;
that there is no forgiveness for me."&#xD;
"My dear James, yoi~ might as well doubt God's power to creatO, orto&#xD;
destroy, as to doubt Ills power to forgive. Xou must pray to Him. Arid I&#xD;
will help you I will pray incessantly for you, James, till you feel that your&#xD;
sins against the Creator ar~ forgiven."&#xD;
'Nearly all of that day Martba and I spent in talking, much of ~hiisJt~&#xD;
no doubt, to strange ears, would have sounded as foolish as the talk of&#xD;

young lQverS. But it was not so to us, who bad been estranged for tea&#xD;
tong, weary..yoa~s of wretebedness and suffering, and torture on the part&#xD;
of my poor wife..&#xD;
During. the 'day abe. did not Wish to go outside the house, but just at&#xD;
sunset she thought~ she would like to~take a little walk into the surr~und~&#xD;
ing country. The. weather was na~at delightful, the atn~o~phere being&#xD;
clear and the air 'balniy. ' When Martha'.went to dress herself, she found&#xD;
that all her. clothing had become moth eaten, or so rotten with' nijidew' as&#xD;
to falito piecca tit her touch. "I f4~lt very contemptible~ when I saw her&#xD;
dresses~ and shawls, and other gai~nients thus ruined ~ but, passing my&#xD;
a~rm about her, I said:&#xD;
"Never' miad,' dear Martha, I will' go to 'the city tomorrow, and you&#xD;
shall have plenty of 'every thing you want."&#xD;
"You are very' good to me, James," replied my wife, kissing me 'in a&#xD;
fond, childish' w5y;'t but don't go buyL me too much; Just get some-&#xD;
thiag plain and genteel to be in 'ahont' the house here, aut~l to take an oc~&#xD;
caslonal stroll with you into the country. "±&#xD;
So, instead of walking out that evening, Martha and Isat out on the&#xD;
back porch ofthe house, saying nothing about the past,'bul~ con~'ersiiig in&#xD;
~lowing tei"n~s, about the future. We' sat 'close together as~ we talked,&#xD;
mueb like the marble statuettes I had so often 'seen of John Anderson, my&#xD;
Joe. Martha~ 'w~hId' persist in holding one of my bands in b~h of hers,&#xD;
~d eveiy now and then she would say':'&#xD;
"James, I are so glad to have you love me once Inure. '~"'&#xD;
Sometimes' sb~ would even stop 'abruptly itt some unfinished . sentence,&#xD;
and, without any apparent' ettuse, to' repeat" thin to me.&#xD;
At last it, became 'too damp' to slt on the porch 'any' longer; and' I led&#xD;
Martha int~' the house.&#xD;
"Dearest Martha,," said I, 'as we entered the kiteheu, "suppose yoa&#xD;
get us a little supper ready."&#xD;
~My wilb looked at me, and was in the act of waking some reply; but&#xD;
instantly caught' herself, evidently' taking' a ,second thought, ~h~t what&#xD;
she was about to say might perhaps' hurt my feelings.~ Then she~chang~~&#xD;
tid it, and 'replied:&#xD;
"Indeed 'I' 'will, with 'pleasure, dear 'James, though, 'from lack of prae~~&#xD;
tice, I may not please 'you as well' as I' could otherwise."&#xD;
"~Well, 1' will help you," said' 1. "First I will make, up' the fire, grind'&#xD;
the coffee, and cut a nice slice of hare',' whilo you peel the potatoes. You&#xD;
will find the tbing~ i~ the same p~Iaces' nearly as~ they were before '&#xD;
I stumbled here in my spee&amp;amp;~, and; as the 'hot blood; mantled to my face,&#xD;
I finished' with the words, "as th~y used' to be. "&#xD;
Martha and I soon had supper ready', and sat down to it side by side.&#xD;
~at she' did not cat very much, and; 'when I urged her to do co, she're-&#xD;
plied4:  '                     "&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, James dear, I am too happy to eat."&#xD;
'And indeed my own appetite 'wa~ 'but little bette±'fr~zti the ea~ne ca~~&#xD;
After this pleasant evertilig 'meal was over, and Martha had cleared awa~*&#xD;
the dishes, she and' I went up stairs to what, when we were 'first mnrried~&#xD;
used'to be our sitting room.&#xD;
"Now, my dear," said I,'let me begin my'repettauiee at ohee. You&#xD;

Heaven leading Satan to supplicatio~i. And whaixa touching; beautiful,&#xD;
~e~vent prayer' did my wife pour forth in my behalf. As for me .1 could&#xD;
r~ot pray. I could only listen to her words, wring ~my~ hands, and weep&#xD;
like an infant.&#xD;
Soon after we retired. How strange it seemed to me, who. for ten years&#xD;
past, had lain in n~y lair at night like ~onw misanthropical, wild, beast or&#xD;
id~mon; all alone, to slumber, or study, ans~I toss about ~restlessJy; coneout~&#xD;
'lug some infernal deviltry for the morrow. How strange, I repeat, it&#xD;
seemed to me now t~ enfold in my arms my wife, who had been ruthless-&#xD;
ly, brutally, banished from there for a whole decade of her lifetime. As I&#xD;
thns clasped her to m~ throbbing bre~mst, I said:&#xD;
"' Would to God, Mai'tha, it 'ha~d always been thus I"&#xD;
"Oh, James,~~ replied she, with the old expression, "I am So glad to&#xD;
have you love .me once mo~e~~&#xD;
It was a long' time before I went to sleep, though Martha fell into a&#xD;
sound slumber soon ~after she had nestled her head upon my shoulder..&#xD;
Several times, while I' was awake, shehalf murmured some broken word;'&#xD;
ai~d clung tighter to me with her clasping, arms, as though she were dream..&#xD;
lug of some new separation. I would always soothe her then with ten-&#xD;
der expressions of endearment, 'and draw her closer to n~e..,.&#xD;
The next day immediately after brem~kfast-which meal Martha prepare~&#xD;
~d entirely herself.-I wont dowa' to the city and did not get hack till&#xD;
night, so occupied was I with' making purchases of such things as I&#xD;
thought would be useful to, or gratify my wife. Among other things I&#xD;
bought a beautiful horse and earria~re, cspec~ally for Martha, whom I knew,&#xD;
after her long term of incarceration and sufferings,, would be in no con~~&#xD;
~ition to walk for sometime. Into this vehicle I loaded my other pur-&#xD;
chases, and drove b'omeward~at a' rapid rate.'&#xD;
As I came up the road that commanded' a view of my 'house, I could'&#xD;
see the pale face of my wife,' pressed; against the sittir~g room window.&#xD;
She was watching for me. Pulling out my handkerchief, I waved it to&#xD;
her to let know that it was I coming. Instantly she disappeared,'and in~&#xD;
a few moments 'more she was standing out. on the porch, ready to' 'wel-&#xD;
come me.&#xD;
"I have been, very lonesome Without you, dear James," exclaimed&#xD;
Martha, as I sprung from the carriage, and t~ok berm, my arms.&#xD;
"And I have been as expeditious as I possibly could, ~darling, consider..&#xD;
Izig the quantity .efjuy purchases. ~Just wait till I get all into tha house,&#xD;
and then you will see how :many nice things'I Mive bought you."&#xD;
Almost with the joyousness of a young girl 'did Martha assist me to&#xD;
carry in th9 many an~l~varhrns purchases, that I had mnde~ Of all these.&#xD;
that which ~she~w~s1 znost~pleased with, was a'larg~ Dible, for which I&#xD;
~ia4 paid fifty~doflars, and we spent~the rest of 'the afternoon and evening;&#xD;
In esarching and reading itssacred pages.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUTTEWS DL4TH BED CONFESSION.&#xD;
The next day was taken up with examining the different dress patterns.&#xD;
laces1 linens, muslins and So. forth, that I had fetched home. Before I&#xD;
married Martha, she had been aseankstre~5, and so, now she quite handily&#xD;
made up all the dresses and the garments she needed. Two weeks were&#xD;
required, before she had enough done to enable her to appear before auy&#xD;
one. Then I advertised for doi~estic help, in response to which ,I got*&#xD;
two servants for Martha, in order that she should have nothing ~vhtttever&#xD;
to do except, to oversee the affairs of the household.&#xD;
My wife had been nearly six weeks restored to her proper position as&#xD;
my wife, and she seemed to be improving in her health~ One day she&#xD;
and I took a drive (Iowa the pike. The afternoon was a most lovely one&#xD;
when we started out, but, all of a sudden the sky grew overcast, and ~&#xD;
chilly, the rain commenced, that drenched us both to the skin, before we&#xD;
reached home. The moment I got back, I took every precaution to guard&#xD;
against any ill effects of the wetting Martha had received. I could but&#xD;
compare this solicitude with my former criminal carelessness and murder,&#xD;
ous cruelty toward Martha.&#xD;
Notwithstanding all this, however, my poor wife's shattered frame and&#xD;
constitution, shattered by. my wickedness, had not strength enough to re-&#xD;
pulse the attack of cold, which followed, and within five weeks from the&#xD;
day of her ride, my darling wife breathed her last in my arms, of what&#xD;
the three eminent physicians, I called in to attend her, called "Gallopin&amp;amp;&#xD;
~onsumption.~~&#xD;
On the day she died, Martha would not bear me out of her sight.&#xD;
" Please do not leave me, dear'James, for the end is very near now; if&#xD;
I live till sunset, it will be as much as I can do, Hold me in your arms,&#xD;
dear, till I am gone. It will be like going to sleep on your bosom, as I&#xD;
did in the long ago."&#xD;
I took her off of the bed-she was so wasted away as to be ho burden&#xD;
whatever-and sat down in the large, cushioned chair. The mere lifting&#xD;
exhausted her so much that for several hours, she could not speak, and&#xD;
she just lay like a baby gazing up into my face with her b4ght, happy,&#xD;
blue eyes fixed on mine.&#xD;
Oh, Martha, if you could only get better," I kept ~ialf moaning to&#xD;
myself.&#xD;
At last when she could speak, she replied:&#xD;
"I shall soon be better, dear James; so~n be better now. Tonight&#xD;
will be my glorious morning. Presently I shall fall asleep, and when .[&#xD;

TEN YEARS ~0F TORTURE; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
of felkity. As I thought of my crimes, I -felt certain that I would ne-va&#xD;
gotoher-no matter how sincerely I repented.&#xD;
The sun- 'was just going down, leaving a long, warni yellow shaft of&#xD;
light -to move slowly up the wall toward the ceiling. Martha glanced&#xD;
once in awhile at this shaft of fading light, and just as it disappeared, she&#xD;
said in-the &amp;amp;ld, childlike way:&#xD;
0-h, James, I feel I am so glad, so happy to have you love me once&#xD;
more. Kiss me!" -&#xD;
This request -was made in - such a strong, earnest tone of voice, that I&#xD;
atarted,- and looked more intently at my wife. Her tone was so much&#xD;
like tjiat- Qf a person hurried by taking leave, -that I said to myself as -L&#xD;
kissed her: - -&#xD;
She is going now "&#xD;
"Oh James, I am-so glad to have you love me once more."&#xD;
.1 instinotively looked upward, for I could have taken oath, that the&#xD;
~oice- which repeated these words of Martha's was in the air above me.&#xD;
Yet it was her voice.&#xD;
When I gazed - down upon my -Martha again, she had died, and in my&#xD;
arms rested only her earthl~r form. I kissed the wan, thin lips again and&#xD;
- again; and again; and tried- to -make - the wasted arms twine about my&#xD;
neck. But the spirit was gone,- and they fell heavily away frorti me as in&#xD;
i~ev~nge for my former wickedness:&#xD;
Then- I rose and laid the corpse upon the bed, and straightened and&#xD;
eompoeed the limbe. -Then Ileft the honee and wandered I don't know&#xD;
where till morning. Then I returned home, and, from that moment -till&#xD;
the funeral. was over, I never left my dear, departed Martha.&#xD;
Subsequently I discharged my servants, and lived the life of a hermit.&#xD;
I shut up all the house, except this room wLerein I used to torture my&#xD;
poor wilb. Here, surrounded wfth the horrible machines I had construct'.&#xD;
ed; here, most 'of the while in the identical' cage, in which I had locked&#xD;
Martha for so - many dre~iry, frightful - years, 1 have passed' my time day&#xD;
and night in deep, contrite repentance and self abasement. But still I&#xD;
feel that I am~ unforgivei~ by God, and when I remember the enormity of&#xD;
my sins, it seems as though I never can be forgfvex~, though sainted Mar~&#xD;
tha herself should add her own pleadings to my supplications." - -&#xD;
-The Manuscript from here out 'contains nothing but a mass of half&#xD;
- wild, boif despairing, broken sentences and metaphysical disquisitions&#xD;
and theories, Dot interesting to -the -general reader. These -are mTh.gled&#xD;

Thy it on a~tha's ~grave. xpended all iny"sleill wad eaV~ in cutting&#xD;
the k~tters on its pure white surface. "-&#xD;
[Bishop Willi-an~s, when he visited the cemetery to sea this strange&#xD;
tomb stone, found it on the wife's grave. rvhe latter was most beautiful.&#xD;
ly adorned, by the repentant husband's own band. The' mouzid. itself&#xD;
was perfectly rounded, the shape being secured so as to last for 'a-long,&#xD;
lorg time, by a most ingeniogs arrangement of fragments of stone. The&#xD;
grass on it also differed from that on the surrounding graves, it being of&#xD;
a richer, brighter green. It was quite likely grown fr mseed; that Sutten&#xD;
had obtained from a foreign land, while trav~l4ii~g. A. -be-autifdl specimen&#xD;
of a dark leafed, over-green, ground ivy was trained and pruned so as to&#xD;
form at perfect cross; and, exactly in the middle, Where the two beams&#xD;
crossed each other, was set the t~tblet. It was of-pure, Italian,. white&#xD;
niarbleii~ the shape of~a classic shield. It-s size w~ about-twenty one&#xD;
inches long, fifteen inches wide, and four to five inches thick. The in-&#xD;
scription on it -was simply the expvession of Mrs. Sutten's, that made&#xD;
such a deep impression on the-husband:&#xD;
"JA~!J~8, I AM SO GLAD TO RAVE YOU LOVE ME ONCE MORE."&#xD;
"-When I entered the. cemetery I overtook an old lady accompanied by&#xD;
a little girb~-a most beautiful chUd wh~ innocently asked me:&#xD;
"Good-gentleman. may I see you- do that?"&#xD;
~' Do what, my child?" asked I, in su~~rise.           -&#xD;
"Wby,-put that stone on yoOr~wife'~ grave:?"&#xD;
"What makee you think it ig-for ~-'~ wif~-'a gi-~~e~?" I inquired, smiling&#xD;
in -spite of the- heavy feelings whieh~ hbld 'm~ in their thrall.&#xD;
"Because it is so pretty," wasrthe artless rejoinder.&#xD;
"Well it is uiy wife's grave," said -I., - -&#xD;
Thea the grandmother joined, in th~ conversation:&#xD;
L~ You must excuse ~far~ha~ sir," said she, "but she is-very inqnisitive&#xD;
especially about funerals and grave yards. We hare noone-belonging to&#xD;
us buried hero-; but, for all that, I atu obliged to fetch her her~e iiearly&#xD;

"Yes, I have nqtiped he~'- o~ severaloeeasiens that- L have ~been to th~&#xD;

"Oh; I knew that well enough," she answered, "because of the way&#xD;
you behaved whenever I saw you at the grate. You '~vould ~ot have&#xD;
done so to a little child, nor a man, nor any one you did not love very&#xD;
much. Please Sir, did you not always love that lady, your wife, a great&#xD;
~deal4"&#xD;
"'I could not brave the truth to that innocent young creature, who diii&#xD;
not know how ehe pierced my soul with her question, and I lied to her as&#xD;
"I said:&#xD;
"Vertainly my~child."&#xD;
She and her grandmother both walked along with me, until I reacin~d&#xD;
Martha's grave and remained there, until tbe' marble tablet had been&#xD;
properly adjusted in its position. Both then bade me good day and I saw&#xD;
them no more.&#xD;
When I returned home I got down the scrap book .in which my poor&#xD;
wife had recorded her feelings from tinie to time during the long, dreary'&#xD;
years, I had her shut up ii~ the horrible cage. These tortured me when.&#xD;
ever I perused them, but there was a fascination about them that it was&#xD;
entirely impossible for me to resist. There was one in particular which&#xD;
invariably met my eye first somehow or other. It was penned the next&#xD;
day after I had crushed Martha's limb in the Iron Book' It was this:&#xD;
"Yesterday James put me to a new and dreadful torture, thatof screw-&#xD;
ing my leg un in a kind of iron boot which is so constructed, that, by the&#xD;
turning of different sets of screws I was put to' the most excrutiating&#xD;
agony. I thought at one moment that I would go completely out' of my&#xD;
mind with pain. But, thank God, who gave me power to endure this&#xD;
new ondeal of my faith, I triumphed nt last.&#xD;
"Again and again the question recurs to me, why does James treat me&#xD;
in this barbarous manner?' Had I been his worst enemy he could not&#xD;
treat me more dreadfully than he does.' 'Yet I have never spoken an ill&#xD;
or harsh word to him.&#xD;
~'But he cannot always be this way~ He is p6ssessed 'i~ some myste-&#xD;
rious way by the Evil One. Satan has him iii his clutches and he is&#xD;
forced to do his bidding. Again some times I think that God allows all&#xD;
this that lie may try m'e and' see if I am worthy to be considered His&#xD;
hand maiden. Thus far I believe F have proven my faith in the powel'&#xD;
of God by my endurance of the tortures to which I have been compelled&#xD;
to submit.&#xD;
"Sometimes the flesh is weak, and I feel the rising' of runruhurs in&#xD;
my~ heart. Then the clouds gather around me' and all beccx~ies dark.&#xD;
But like Christian in the Pilgrim's Progress I rouse myself, call' upon&#xD;
my $av.iour, and at once a brilliirnt star of light breaks through and&#xD;
disperses all the clouds ; my murmurs' are hushed, my repiningS&#xD;
give way to rejoicings' and I 'become as contented and as happy as&#xD;
though I had n~ care, nor sufferings in' the world. Oh, my&#xD;
&#xD;
SUTTEN'S DEATH BED CONFESSIO~J.&#xD;
Savior, my Blessed R6deemer 'I thank Thy floly Name for all Thy by'..&#xD;
ing kindness. Vouchsafe to me in the future, as in the past, strength to&#xD;
drink of whatever cup of bitterness may be put to my lips.&#xD;
"But, above all, I beseech Thee; in the plentitude of Thy Mercy, to&#xD;
forgive my husband and remember IIdt his transgressions against him&#xD;
He knows not what he does. Satan bath bound him in his chains, and&#xD;
he cannot escape without the iifterposition of Thy power. Pluck him, I&#xD;
pi'ay Thee, as a brand from the 'burning. Save him, unto life eternal, that&#xD;
his soul may not perish but may be held~ precious in Tby sight~&#xD;
A nothea' extract reads as~follows:&#xD;
"My head aches*~ dreadfully this morning. I do not know how long&#xD;
James intends to treat me as he is doing now.. Surely it must end soon,&#xD;
for I cannot much longer bear up under it. Oh, my dear husband, would&#xD;
to God some beneficent angel would only kring you a new heart and ~&#xD;
right spirit from on High, that you might ~ee the error of your ways and&#xD;
repent.&#xD;
"Often times I think what a dreadful thing it would be if you were to&#xD;
die suddenly, unrepentant an~l in ~he full fiowir of your Bins againstRea.~&#xD;
yen., Everyday, yes, and every hour nearly, I pray, that God will not&#xD;
look toward you in anger, but in His Great Mercy save your precious&#xD;
soul for life eternal."&#xD;
The last entry in Mrs. Sutten's diary is one which was made after the&#xD;
great and happy change had taken place in her husband, It reads like&#xD;
the perfection of felicity.&#xD;
"At last my prayers are answered. The clouds which have hung so&#xD;
gloomily and heavily athwart my skies are broken, and the bright, warm&#xD;
sun shines through. It is like the sudden coming of Summer with its&#xD;
pleasant flowers and song birds in the middle of the Winter; The dreary,&#xD;
frightfully dreary ten years of torture and misery and horror are passed&#xD;
and gone forever. The tritul has been a dreadful one; but I thank my&#xD;
God with my whole heart that I have been endowed with strength to&#xD;
hear meekly the tilbnlations, to which I have been sul~jected. It isal~&#xD;
for the best; all for the best."&#xD;
Here the mhnuscript broke off and Bishop Williams could not find any&#xD;
continuation of it, though it might have been mixed in with the 'heap' of&#xD;
papers which encumbered the drawer. Never before has there been a&#xD;
case, at least that we have any record of that has presented such charac-&#xD;
teristics as that of John Sutten and his wife.&#xD;
Sutten was evidently an intellectual human tiger; that is the only ex-&#xD;
pression which will convey anything like an adequate idea of the man's&#xD;
Organization. His moral part was perfectly dead. Bishop Williams, Ia&#xD;
