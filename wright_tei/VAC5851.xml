            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>In presenting this collection of fugitive sketches and poems to the public, I have no
               intention of attempting to disarm criticism by an affectation of humility. The
               feeling which has moved me to the publication of a book, is probably similar to that
               which has actuated hundreds of others, and does not demand a definition.</p>
            <p>By way of explanation, it may be stated that the discrepancy in the character of
               those burlesque compositions dated at Chicago, and those which are not, is accounted
               for by the fact that the former were written over another <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nom
                  de plume</foreign>, and in a different guise from that of "Hans Patrick Le
               Connor."</p>
            <p>The "Miscellaneous Poems" are juvenile productions, written many years ago, and now
               brought to trial for the first time.</p>
            <pb n="viii-9" xml:id="VAC5851-00000005"/>
            <p>Expressing my gratitude to many friends for their encouragement in this enterprise,
               and at the same time taking the opportunity to express the conviction that the book
               is somewhat fortunate, inasmuch as by common formality I am debarred the privilege of
               criticising it, I beg leave to remain, etc.,</p>

               <p>Through all the trials and struggles, and amid the darkest scenes that have
                  shadowed the destiny of our young republic during the last hundred years, there is
                  one name that has shone and still shines like a meteor, or, perhaps I might say
                  with more truthfulness, like the sun, with an unvarying and perpetual splendor.
                  There was one man whose courage and integrity never faltered, whose patriotic
                  ardor never cooled, and the light of whose pristine glory never flickered. Need I
                  tell you that I allude to the illustrious and immortal Washington? I mean no
                  other, and if by the penning of a few desultory remarks, I can succeed in adding
                  to the estimation in which he is already hold by the American people, I shall feel
                  that I have not lived in vain. I know he is already much honored by his
                  countrymen; a few of them have gone so far as to name their children after him,
                  others have extended the same compliment to remunerative horses of the masculine

                  have observed his portrait hanging above rustic mantel-pieces, side by side with
                  the lamb-like Lincoln; yet I feel—pardon me, but I cannot help it—I still feel
                  that he has not received that attention which his virtue merits. Too much cannot
                  be said or done in his praise, for he was a good square man.</p>
               <p>This is an age of progress.</p>
               <p>There's a proposition; now the proof. It was a custom formerly to observe with
                  appropriate donors the birth-day of our nation's first chief. That practice has
                  almost totally disappeared. I am no hero-worshipper, never was; I have seen a few
                  great men, so called, and found that they were simply human after all; that they
                  lived, breathed and had their being pretty much the same as other folks; and am an
                  ardent opponent of the practice of apostheosizing pigmies, so prevalent among the
                  upper strata of our beloved country; but I do think, as I have before intimated,
                  that if there is one figure in the grand drama of American events worthy of
                  unremetting homage, it is Washington—and it makes me almost sick at heart to
                  behold an effort to shelve him with the little fishes, while his position in the
                  affections of his people is imperilled by the rising star of some modern upstart,
                  whose deeds have not withstood the fiery test of history and impartial criticism.
                  But this is an age of progress, and perhaps all is for the better.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the 22d I sallied forth, and wending my way to the head of
                  Fourth street, took a full-length view of that lively thoroughfare, when, what was
                  my astonishment at beholding not less than half a dozen of our freedom-soiled
                  banners floating proudly to the breeze. There being some doubt in my mind as to
                  whether another War had broke out, and these flags were merely the familiar signs
                  of recruiting offices, or whether there had been a sudden influx of patriotic gift
                  enterprise men, I mustered courage to file beneath one of the starry emblems and
                  inquire its meaning. "Washington's birth-day" was the only response. I was
                  satisfied, likewise horrified—for it had never flashed across my mind that this
                  was a day which all should honor. Rushing into various places where no bunting was
                  displayed, I inquired why they did'nt "hang out?" I received all sorts of answers.
                  Some were in the dark as well as myself; others were too busy; one man told me not
                  to bother him or be would "hang <emph>me</emph> out;" and so on, and so on. There
                  was a squad of four-year-old ragamuffins parading the streets in grey apparel, and
                  carrying paper banners, while one of them wrung from a reluctant fife the
                  ear-piercing notes of a tune which I think they termed the "Concord Banner." There
                  was also a cannon lying on the sidewalk, but it was mute, and only reminded me of
                  the great wooden gun that the "mad Hercules," as he was called, used to carry
                  about on his shoulder in the streets of my native village. All, with a very few
                  exceptions, were insensible to the day, and evidently not caring whether
                  Washington was ever born or not.</p>
               <p>But I found one man that pleased me. He was a happy-looking codger, and judging
                  from the cast of his countenance that I might pour out my patriotic sentiments to
                  him without any danger of casting pearls before hogs, I went in.</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5851-00000007"/>
               <p>"Tsh!" said he, as soon as I had opened the conversation, and seizing me by the
                  button-hole he fairly dragged me through a little old dirty sort of curiosity
                  shop, and up a rickety, dark, musty flight of stairs that seemed sinking away
                  beneath my tread, into an amber-colored room, where he pushed me down on a
                  three-legged stool and commenced filling his pipe. I saw at once he was a maniac.
                  I thought of the Chamber of Death, the Inquisition, and a thousand other horrors,
                  but I was determined to remain nevertheless, for there is something to be learned
                  sometimes even from madmen. When he began to speak I allowed him to proceed
                  without interruption.</p>
               <p>"Hang out my banners, eh? Ha, ha, ha! That's good. I had a banner once, a glorious
                  banner, but I have none now. Ah, me! But why do I mourn? Why should they hang
                  their banners any more? They can afford to sit in silence now and gaze on the
                  grandeur of their achievements, (singing): <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"That's a stave of a song I have written—a staving song. The country is happy—look
                  at it. Missouri for instance. Before the war she had cattle feeding on a thousand
                  hills; now there are not a thousand cattle on all her hills. Amalgamation,
                  miscegenation, twenty-five thousand copper, molasses and gravy-colored Japhets
                  that never will find a father on the face of the habitable globe. This is an age
                  of progress. Federal soldiers have done their work nobly, and recorded their deeds
                  all over the South in black and white.</p>
               <p>"Will oil and water mix? Of course not. Did you ever see a woman that could throw
                  a stone or sharpen a pencil, or fold a letter small enough for an envelope the
                  first trial? But they will vote, sir, they will vote. The revolution works and the
                  good time is coming. Banners! I tell you, sir, the Radicals are too mean to hang
                  out banners. They are too stingy. Why don't the Democrats do it? O, bless your
                  innocence, you must live in Paradise. Robbed, my friend, robbed—robbed by the
                  Radicals until they have not enough left to buy a flag. If bunting was two cents a
                  bolt, I could'nt buy enough to make a banner the size of a two-shilling postal
                  piece. I honor the soldiers; brave men all, but like most progressive newspapers
                  they have had bad banners. St. Louis sent brave men into the army too. None braver
                  in the world. The men of this city are bound to be courageous; they drink
                  Mississippi river water, and they have sand in their gizzards. Ha! ha! Did you
                  ever think of that? Fletcher was in the war—our own noble Governor. A wonderful
                  man that Fletcher—a great juggler. I saw a Chinese knife-thrower in Bombay once,
                  who would stand another Chinaman against a wall, pretend he was going to throw a
                  knife at his breast, frighten him till his hair stood on end, then throw knives
                  between all the hairs without hitting them. Fletcher can beat that all hollow.
                     <emph>He splits the hairs, sir; he splits them.</emph> Wonderful juggler, he.
                  Going to Paris, eh? You don't say so? To the great exposition, I suppose?

                  don't like. Well, that will be a sensation; the Parisians all running round
                  singing <q>

                  at railroad from the top of Pilot Knob down an inclined plane to St. Louis, and
                  iron can be brought down without trouble—and that he is going to run a gas-pipe up
                  through to illuminate the whole State on great occasions, with a furnace inside
                  sufficient to heat the country five hundred miles around. Great man, that; has
                  made the State too hot already so hot half the people can't stay here, and they
                  are all going to Brazil. Butternuts turning to Brazil nuts. Ha, ha! That's
                  capital. Banners! Washington's Birth-day! Pooh! Look at Fletcher! Sir, I have a
                  scheme for the amelioration of the miseries of all mankind. This is an age of
                  progress. Enfranchise women and negroes, and make it a capital offence to
                  manufacture or sell intoxicating stimulants. Have one licensed distiller in each
                  State to manufacture for medicinal purposes, and put him under enormous bonds.
                  Then comes the millennium. What in the name of common sense will the leaders of
                  the progressive party do for something to talk about? How will they live without
                  hobbies? I had a strange dream last night on this very subject. Thought my idea
                  was realized—universal suffrage was recognized, and liquor-drinking
                  abolished—Thaddeus Stevens, Wendell Phillips, Fred Douglass, Anna Dickinson and
                  Lucy Stone were shut up in a cave together to devise some 'great moral idea'
                  hitherto undiscovered, and after a hundred days and nights, they emerged from the
                  cavern urging upon Congress the necessity of passing a law prohibiting suicide.
                  The two women took exceptions to some of the proceedings and bolted. They came out
                  from their confinement with a minority report in favor of disfranchising all male
                  citizens who could not prove the existence of negro blood in their veins. And so
                  it will be, sir. This progressive idea is a complete circle, there is no end to
                  it, we must return to the starting point. Extremes meet, and the end of
                  civilization is barbarism. Mark my words. Beware! Good morning."</p>
               <p>I returned the courteous good morning and retired in a very singular frame of mind
                  indeed. My opinion of Washington is much diminished, and my appreciation of
                  Stevens, Phillips &amp; Co., greatly heightened, but I still think there ought to
                  have been more banners out on the 22d. It will require a month at least to digest
                  what the madman said.</p>

               <head>WOMEN AND THEIR RIGHTS.</head>
               <p>At a certain peculiar sort of social gathering, one evening, convened for the
                  double purpose of giving encouragement to mental culture, or, as it perhaps ought
                  more properly be termed, on account of the harrowing process employed, mental
                  agriculture, and devising a more expeditious and satisfactory method than has
                  hitherto been discovered for the destruction of sweet cakes, chocolate and
                  lozenges, the conversation turned upon Congressman Noell's quizzical proposition
                  to enfranchise the women of that three-cent piece of the National domain known as
                  the District of Columbia. The meeting was an assemblage of the cats, flannel and
                  canary bird Democracy, and consisted chiefly of young ladies between the ages of
                  forty-five and sixty, with a meagre sprinkling of rosebuds and blossoms, that,
                  scattered among the others, reminded one forcibly of wild flowers blooming among
                  some ancient ruins. Convivial interchange of feeling was the order of the evening.
                  "And pray, Mr. Le Conner," quoth some two dozen dames in pink and white checks and
                  immaculate frills, "what may you think of this new-fashioned dogma—the divine
                  philosophy of woman's rights?" To which the queer old anchorite, whose interesting
                  personal appellation appears at the head of this article ticle, straightway
                  replied in the following sublimely autocratic and heterodoxical outburst. Said
                  he:</p>
               <p>Woman, in her normal condition, is an ideal counterpart of a fiery young charger
                  after he has been taught obedience to the whip and rein. She don't know her
                  strength; if she did, she would everlastingly smash things. Lucky it is indeed for
                  mankind that she is thus ignorant. The potential proverb, "know thyself," never
                  was addressed to the frail sex, so-called, though it is a glaring misnomer. It
                  would be a dangerous consummation for woman to make her own acquaintance.</p>
               <p>You were speaking of woman's rights. The very idea is a shocking absurdity. Rights
                  indeed! I tell you it is we, the stern, robust masculine portion of creation who
                  are oppressed, and you, ladies, are the oppressors. O, you smile, I perceive—a
                  smile of incredulity—but no matter. I have travelled nights, and lived on lunches,
                  and therefore I know whereof I speak.</p>
               <p>Let me illustrate your despotism. Here you all sit to-night, for instance, sipping
                  your Oolong beside a glowing fire, and mingling in pleasant and edifying
                  conversation. Unmolested by the serpent Man, you reign here in your glory. Of
                  course, two or three of us ancient mariners on life's troubled waters are invited
                  to be present, because we are so old and stale and dried up that you can crack
                  your confounded jokes on us without giving offence. For you this is magnificent
                  comfort; this is enjoyment; this is happiness; it's just old persimmons. But
                  listen to that young man going along the street whistling "Ole Bob Ridley." Where
                  do you suppose<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5851-00000010"/> pose he is going? I will
                  tell you. He is going to the very Old Scratch, his Majesty below stairs, just as
                  rapidly as nocturnal carousals and powerful potations will carry him. And you,
                  ladies, are the cause of it. <emph>You are his murderers!</emph> (Sensation.)</p>
               <p>It is not of the evil you have done I choose to speak so much as the good you have
                  left undone. Your crimes of omission are manifold, and their darkness will stand
                  like a black statue upon the monument of your collective glory when your
                  individual names shall be forgotten among the wrecks of time. Look at this
                  picture.</p>
               <p>A young man from the country, who has been brought up in the way he should go,
                  accustomed to the society of kind-hearted matrons and pure maidens, arrives in the
                  city in quest of fortune. Inevitably he is at once cast headlong into a
                  boarding-house, or Hash Asylum. He sits down to his meals with a preacher on one
                  side and a pickpocket on the other, a wandering minstrel opposite, "a poor but
                  honest" genius to the right oblique, and a clerk, professional man or mechanic at
                  the head of the table. The only females he discovers are the waiting girls, whose
                  brazen faces and the enormity of whose pinchbeck breastpins, that shine like the
                  big brass balls on the cupolas of country meeting-houses, startle him. He may
                  further discover, by the color of the hair in the biscuits and butter, that there
                  is another female in the house whom he has never seen. She is the culinary artist
                  of the establishment. Now, it has been settled beyond peradventure that young men
                  at a certain age yearn for the society of young ladies, and nothing else will suit
                  their purposes as well. Everything has been tried—books, dogs, fiddles, silver
                  watches, trotting horses, nine-pins, dominoes, prussic acid, gum
                  arabic—everything, but it's no go. The heart craves crinoline, and nothing
                  shorter. But there is an impediment in the way of this ambition. Young men dare
                  not be seen conversing with the servants, for in that case the house is sure to be
                  wrapped in a conflagration of scandal. The landlady has a daughter of course, (all
                  landladies do) but she is a household goddess, and is only to be seen on state
                  occasions. If a young man looks at her he is expected to marry her. He must also
                  marry the entire boarding house and all the proprietor's relations, and forego the
                  right of claiming anything as his own. Young man discouraged. Leaves the cracked
                  prima donna of the boarding-house in the fourth floor parlor with her ricketty
                  piano, and goes forth in search of female society. Where will he find it? Not at
                  church nor in respectable gatherings, for there he may behold but never become
                  acquainted. Fate leads him among the ballet girls, where, by spending a few
                  dollars, he may become the cynosure of all eyes, and revel in a perfect sea of
                  happiness. Spangles and short skirts, raven ringlets from the raving wig-maker,
                  pearly teeth bought from resurrectionists and professional jawbreakers, swan-like
                  necks, alabaster brows, ebon eyes, rosy cheeks, cherry lips, sea-shell ears, and
                  all the accompaniments of female loveliness reign in vast profusion. Young man is
                  intoxicated. If he isn't he soon will be. His next step is to visit beer saloons,
                  where there are pretty waiter girls to hand him beer. "The horse-leach hath two
                  daughters, and<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5851-00000011"/> they cry more, more!" we
                  are told. Saloon girls don't. At one swoop they take all you have got—money,
                  morality and reputation—everything. They never cry "more." They make a lion out of
                  you when you first go in, but send you out as spotted as a leopard—spotted by the
                  police, to watch you incessantly, and spotted by the religious community, who
                  won't look at you at all. Between the ballet girls and the gentle beerists the
                  young man is soon done for. His ruin is accomplished, and in a little while he may
                  sing as he goes, the familiar old song, slightly varied: <q>
                     <l>"I'm a bloat, I'm a bloat on the dark rolling sea."</l>
                  </q> To this sort of dissipation succeeds gambling. The young man is made
                  acquainted with the "tiger," or Faro (which is not a Scriptural institution, as
                  its name indicates), keno, rondeau, monte, roulette, and all the other games with
                  fascinating foreign titles, until, penniless and broken hearted, he sinks into his
                  grave, spending his last hours, perhaps, in a hospital, where for once in half a
                  dozen years he is thrown into the society of a respectable woman, but she is such
                  a horrid old crone that he is glad to die to get rid of looking at her, and thinks
                  it no wonder that a one-legged soldier wrote on his cot in the hospital at
                  Chancellorsville, as it is reported, the stanza: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>O woman in our hours of ease,</l>
                        <l>Uncertain, coy and hard to please;</l>
                        <l>When pain and anguish wring the brow,</l>
                        <l>A pesky aggravation thou.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The young man breathes his last in the arms of his attendant, and is gathered to
                  his last home, where, according to certain sectarian views of the matter, his
                  companionship will be even worse than it was in this life. Cynical, am I? Can't
                  see it. Every word I have said is truth.</p>
               <p>At this stage of the speaker's remarks many of his hearers became quite sad with
                  grief. One, a beautiful maiden of some forty-five summers, drew very near to him,
                  and while stroking his hoary beard with her tender hands, and bathing his bald
                  head with her hot, briny tears, wanted to know if she should call, back the fellow
                  that was whistling "Ole Bob Ridley," and invite him in. The speaker thought she
                  had better not, if she valued her life and property, as the aforesaid was, in all
                  human probability, a garroter. He then proceeded:</p>
               <p>And so you all think you ought to vote? (Voices, "Yes.") What! <emph>you want to
                     place yourselves on an equality with niggers?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>This presented the matter in a new light. They all declared unanimously they would
                  not vote for any consideration. The speaker continued:</p>
               <p>Now, do try and be a little more sensible. Drink as much tea as you like, wear
                  thick flannels next the skin in winter time, and keep your feet warm, but stop
                  this eternal twaddle about the unnatural conflict of races and the elevation of
                  your oppressed sex. If you feel oppressed, quit wearing stays. It will help you
                  amazingly. Set yourselves to work in the cause of saving young men from
                  destruction, by supplying them with more agreeable society than they can find in
                  beer gardens and club houses. Set your daughters after them, if you have any; if
                     not,<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5851-00000012"/> your grand-daughters, or the
                  daughters of your neighbors; and find a means by which strange young men of good
                  parentage may become acquainted with them. Kick up a revolution in this direction,
                  if you please, and let the voting go. By so doing you will earn a title to a
                  glorious immortality. Woman's influence is mighty and must prevail. It is said
                  that a woman was the origin of the noblest sentiment ever uttered by one of our
                  most distinguished statesmen. Henry Clay, having been introduced to a very
                  beautiful lady, the wife of a certain Mr. Wright, exclaimed, "I would rather be
                  Wright than President." The words are imperishable. And behold, what an estimate
                  Socrates set upon silence in a woman, for he said to Xantippe: "With all thy
                  faults, I love thee <emph>still!</emph> Cleopatra was also a woman of strong will
                  and considerable talent, as was shown by her influence over Mark Antony; but she
                  yielded to an overweening womanishness at last, and suffered herself to be stung
                  to death by an Egyptian asp, which she did, I suppose, merely to show that her
                  asp-irations were fully realized. (!!!) Lot's wife was not as influential a woman
                  as she might have been, seeing the position she occupied. She could not control
                  her husband, and the result of her consequent obstreperousness is well known to
                  all. It was doubtless the little disagreement of Mr. and Mrs. Lot that made
                  matrimony a lottery for all time to come. But I forbear. I will adduce no further
                  examples at present.</p>
               <p>In conclusion I will say that unless I soon discern change for the better, I shall
                  abandon my life-long tactics and advocate matrimony as a means of revenge venge
                  upon the fair sex. I will prove to Young America that even a young man on a small
                  salary is better off married than single; that he can marry a girl of frugal
                  habits, live in perfect bliss, keep house, have all he wants to eat and to spare,
                  be intensely respectable, and all for less money than in a state of single
                  blessedness he pays for board and beer; that he cannot afford to be rich until he
                  is thirty years of age, as Mr. Bonner says; that he never will become rich unless
                  he has a wife to help him; and many other things that will cause young men to rush
                  for wives like a thousand of sheep. Then your gay and festive belles may go hang.
                  Open up the portals of your social fabric or I will do this, and remember I have a
                  charter as large as the wind to blow on whom I please.</p>

               <head>A TILT AT A FASHIONABLE FOLLY.</head>
               <p>According to an infallible maxim, it is the duty of the journalist, and of all who
                  sit in judgment upon the affairs of this mundane sphere, to "shoot folly as it
                  flies." The practicability of such a proceeding has long since vanished. Folly no
                  longer flies; it tilts. In a spirit of anti-progressiveness, it seems to have
                  abandoned the motive power to which it was indebted for the former rapidity of its
                  flight, and has adopted instead a sort of nip-up-de-dooden-dah movement that is
                  positively at variance with the laws of progression, celerity and harmony. This
                  statement is based upon the presumption that the suit of all follies is located in
                  hoop-skirts, which is an indisputable fact, as I shall proceed to demonstrate by
                  truths derived from unquestionable sources.</p>
               <l>It was halt a little while ago—say a couple of weeks—that I became acquainted with
                  the contents of a tilting skirt; a very fascinating fragment of femininity upon
                  whom I was strongly tempted to bestow the remnant of my affections. Bodily, there
                  was not much of her, but in the way of dress she was a good deal. It is a very
                  difficult matter now-a-days to judge of a lady's size by her magnitude. Like a

                  are marvellously deceptive; principally shell, with very little kernel. The
                  stature of the lady in question, however, was no obstacle in the way of her
                  winning my admiration. Personally, my prejudices are in favor of little women. The

               <p>But it is the dress of which I desire more particularly to speak.</p>
               <p>Can I forget (this is not sentimental)—can I—can I forget that balmy afternoon
                  when I first beheld Miss Felicia Tiltaway, in her tilting garments, promenading,
                  pervading and permeating Fourth street? It was not a want of proper appreciation
                  of her captivating appearance—not in token of disrespect, or anything of that
                  kind—that the involuntary explosive interrogation escaped my lips, upon beholding
                  her, "Where is the band?" If I was suddenly seized with the conviction that a
                  circus was approaching, let the erroneous impression be attributed to my own
                  dullness of comprehension, and to my limited knowledge of circuses generally; but
                  not to any visible excess or inconsistency in the attire of the lady aforesaid.
                  Not for worlds.</p>
               <p>She, if I may be allowed to give vent in plain terms to the outgushings of a
                  sincere heart, was the very ideal of female magnificence. She was immense. The
                  Queen of Sheba, Cleopatra, or any other representative of the riches and splendor
                  of antiquity, might not have gazed upon her without feelings of<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000016"/> envy. Solomon, in all his glory, was a trifle
                  compared with her; the Fenian invasion of Canada was not a-raid like her. She was
                  the incarnation and personification of all that is elegant, admirable and grand:
                  red Morocco leather with gold tassels, rosewood and persimmons; she was
                  chain-lightning on wheels.</p>
               <p>I was introduced to her; I basked in the sunshine of her delicious smiles. I was
                  enamored of her, I was in ecstasies, I was demoralized. We strolled together,
                  absorbed with sweet converse, and the appearance of the two of us was like unto
                  that of a beanstalk and pavilion—we were strikingly dissimilar.</p>
               <p>We had proceeded but a short distance when I experienced a stinging sensation in
                  the immediate neighborhood of the top of my left boot, as if some hard, sharp
                  substance had been thrust violently against me. I paused abruptly. When my
                  companion inquired what was the matter, I replied with a very foolish smile, for I
                  did'nt know, but I suspected that some mischievous scamp had been pitching quoits
                  at my legs. In a few minutes I felt another twinge. I bowed, blushed, and
                  stammered a request that I might be permitted to walk on the opposite side. Miss
                  Tiltaway consented. I performed a voyage half around her, and deposited myself
                  about ten feet from the centre, hoping the amplitude of her dress would shelter me
                  in a measure from the missiles which I was confident were being hurled at me from
                  some heartless vagabond in the vicinity. I was mistaken. In a few moments I
                  experienced the same diabolical inconvenience that had annoyed me before I changed
                  my base. A horrible suspicion flashed athwart my mind. Instantly I directed my
                  attention and my optics simultaneously toward the nether border of Mademoiselle's
                  skirt. (She was of French extraction; for convenience sake I speak of her as a
                  French extract.) She followed <unclear/> Her eyes followed mine, and we gazed
                  alternately toward the ground and in each other's faces. To the surrounding
                  multitude, if they observed us, I have no doubt we were a very interesting pair of
                  spectacles.</p>
               <p>But my curiosity and anxiety were satisfied. I now realized the cause of my trials
                  and tribulations. Miss Tiltaway's skirt, at the mercy of every trifling gale, was
                  swaying right and left like a ship in a tempest, and with every gust the wires
                  attacked my shins with tenfold ferocity. Their irregular oscillations were a
                  forcible illustration of Hudibras' description of the equivocating orator. "They
                  wired in and wired out, and not only that, but they wired up and wired down, and
                  wired in all other conceivable directions. Perhaps it is fortunate I was not of a
                  wiry disposition, or I might have flown into a passion. At first I was willing to
                  be charitable, and to allow that some accident had occurred to my lady's robes,
                  but I was soon undeceived, for almost every lady we met was similarly situated.
                  Old and young, good-looking and indifferent, great and small, seemed to have been
                  seized with a mania for perpetual tilting. There were stout, oleaginous ladies,
                  evidently the wives of petroleum merchants, whose skirts tilted slowly and
                  majestically, like the ears of an elephant flopping to the solemn time of an East
                  India pageant.<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5851-00000017"/> Half fledged
                  boarding-school misses bounced along on the sidewalk like India rubber puppets,
                  while their immaculate little skirts tilted this way and that way with a
                  rippity-hippity-devilty-split sort of motion not strictly in accordance with the
                  moral precepts of most of our modern academic institutions. And there were
                  hundreds of ladies embillowed in silks of the most extravagant pattern—the wives
                  of rum-sellers, one might suppose, for their flounces articulated distinctly with
                  every rustle "whiskey!" "whiskey!" "whiskey!" all alike, however, in their
                  disposition to eternal tilting. We struggled through the promenade that afternoon,
                  and after anointing my shins with mutton suet and nightshade three times a day
                  regularly during one whole week, I began to exhibit symptoms of recovery. Maybe
                  I'll go promenading with a tilting skirt again. I think I see myself.</p>
               <p>In the name of humanity—in the name of our down-trodden and oppressed sex, I
                  protest against this fashionable monstrosity, which, with fiendish malignity,
                  seems to have seized upon and upset the whole mental fabric of womankind. I could
                  bear the pincushions stuck tauntingly on the back of the head, and the inverted
                  bread-tray or Chinese umbrella used as a covering for the head—anything before—I
                  could bear it all without a murmur, but these tilting hoops are too many for me. I
                  cave.</p>
               <p>One lady said to me, while endeavoring to defend the innovation, that the main
                  reason why ladies wear the tilting skirt is because it is so cool. I honor her
                  candor. When a lady appears on the streets in one of them, it is about the coolest
                  thing under heaven. What glory it is for young soap-locks, who never speculated to
                  the amount of a dollar in their lives, to stand on the street corners of a windy
                  day and note the rise and fall of cotton. What an explosion there is among them
                  when a skirt blows up! O, it's glorious—it's just old fruit!</p>
               <p>If there is any one thing in this world I admire, it's a neatly, or even elegantly
                  attired lady. If admiration for this class of females were a cardinal virtue, I
                  would be a Cardinal. But when a woman's passion for dress runs away with her
                  brains—when she puts so much on the outside of her head that it destroys
                  everything in it, and when she hangs so much flummery about her person that its
                  very weight undermines her constitution and saps her physical energies, and when,
                  as a final device, she strives to exhibit what the public very well knows is the
                  least attraction she possesses, to wit, her understanding—she must put a very poor
                  estimate indeed upon the amount of common sense remaining among the male portion
                  of our fair creation, if she thinks by such a course, to acquire that honor and
                  esteem to which, in her appropriate sphere, she is so richly entitled. When I
                  shall have become, convinced that an enormity of dress in which it is all but
                  impossible for a lady to stand in an ordinary yard—although she manages very well
                  to stand in fifty yards—whenever I become satisfied that the capping of the climax
                  of the interminable conglomeration of empress trails, waterfalls, and perplexing
                  elliptic skirts, or whatever you call them, with the tilting abomination I<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5851-00000018"/> have described—when I shall have come to
                  believe that these things are elevating and ennobling, and that the appropriate
                  sphere of woman is a hemisphere, with the parallels of latitude represented by
                  steel hoops, the motion of which is constantly suggesting an earthquake, then, and
                  not till then, will I recant, and regret that I have thus titled at one of the
                  sacred institutions of the weaker sex.</p>

               <head>ENTRÉE INTO THE ARENA OF POLITICS.</head>
               <p>"Mornin' 'Squire," said old Chopps, accosting me on the street, and thumping me on
                  the back with such emphasis that my hat bounced off my head, my cigar out of my
                  mouth, and nearly all my senses out of my head. A quaint genius is old Chopps. He
                  is a politician of the primitive kind, and devotes his whole time, talents and
                  physical energies to his profession. If you should see a very corpulent man, with
                  a rotundity indicative of enormous living, and a face about the complexion of a
                  boiled beet or a turkey gobbler's trunk, standing on some street corner in the
                  centre of a little knot of men, and, with one hand gracefully concealed beneath
                  his coat-tails, and the other extended at an angle of forty-five degrees towards
                  the heavens, endeavoring to impress upon them that the opening of a certain alley
                  is not according to the New Constitution—seek no further. That's Chopps—the
                  veritable old boy himself. Chopps' ideals of propriety are somewhat peculiar, as
                  is everything else about him. Doubtless he has read Chesterfield at some time or
                  other, but he has an alacrity at forgetting things, and I don't think he remembers
                  many of the maxims of that distinguished etiquettician.</p>
               <p>"Mornin'," says he, in the manner before mentioned<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000020"/> tioned. "Good morning," says I. "Have you
                  registered?" says he. "I have," says I. "Where at?" says he. "At the Southern,"
                  says I. "Get out," says he; "you know what I mean. Have you registered your name
                  in your precinct so as to secure your franchise at the coming election?" After
                  thoroughly digesting the old gentleman's interrogation, I was compelled to answer
                  in the negative. "What!" he exclaimed, "not registered? I am astonished at you.
                  Come right along with me." And he seized me by the arm, and dragged me off
                  bodily.</p>
               <p>As we jogged along together he said, "I suppose you are sound, Hans?" I replied
                  feelingly, "if you have any doubt about it I can bring twenty certificates from
                  physicians." "O, no," he continued, "you don't comprehend me. Are you sound on the
                  goose?" "O, the goose," I replied, slightly obfuscated, "oh, ah, Yes, I'm
                  hunkadori on the goose."</p>
               <p>I calculate that my "hunkadori" was as much a stumper for him as his "goose" was
                  for me, for he looked moody for several minutes, and said very little.</p>
               <p>At length we stood in the presence of royalty, or "loyalty," I forget which. It
                  was the Registering officer anyhow—a grizzly looking man with green goggles and a
                  bald head, and tobacco juice on his shirt front. I uncovered my head as a solemn
                  tribute to his mighty station. After propounding a few questions of a general
                  nature, such as, Was I the son of my father? Was I male or female? Were my parents
                  all loyal men? and so on, he proceeded to business.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever been a soldier?" says he. "I have," says I. "Were you ever in the
                  rebel army?" says he. "I was," says I. "That's bad," says he. "So I thought," says
                  I. "In what capacity did you serve?" says he. "As a prisoner of war," says I.
                  "That's better," says he. "Can't see it," says I. "What was your conduct while a
                  prisoner?" says he. "I treated my keepers with the utmost respect," says I. "Have
                  you ever read the oath of loyalty prescribed by the Constitution of this State?"
                  says he. "Only one volume of it says I; "when I get a week or two to spare I mean
                  to finish it." "You'll do," says he. "Do what?" says I. "To vote," says he. "Thank
                  you," says I.</p>
               <p>And out we floated—old Chopps and I. "Hans," he exclaimed, grasping my hand
                  fervently when we were in the open air, "Hans, you are a man now. You are my
                  equal."</p>
               <p>"Thunder and lightning! you don't say so!" was my involuntary response to his
                  congratulation.</p>
               <p>"Hans, that's a glorious clause in the bulwark of our liberties that affords such
                  an opportunity as this for making us all equal."</p>
               <p>"Yes, all equal," said I; "white men, niggers and monkeys, and jacka—"</p>
               <p>"S-s-s! no fanaticism, Hans, no fanaticism. Let's get the colored race off our
                  hands first. We'll come to the monkeys by and bye. Now, Hans, I'll tell you what
                  you must do. I see you are all right; you must stump the city for our party."</p>
               <p>"But how can I? there are no stumps."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no matter; speak from pine boxes and whiskey barrels, and doorstops, and
                  balconies, and house-tops<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5851-00000021"/> tops—anything.
                  You shall help to restore to its pristine glory this abandoned city. You shall
                  proclaim to the masses the purity, the grandeur, the sublimity of the great
                  doctrines of Radicalism. Your mighty eloquence will rush down like a Niagara into
                  the ranks of the Democracy, and such as don't come up to us in skiffs will be
                  drowned, Hans—yes, drowned."</p>
               <p>Here the old man became so fatigued that he yielded the floor.</p>
               <p>"But, my dear Chopps, consider," I said: "Do you think the minds of the people out
                  West are sufficiently developed—are they strong enough to receive and retain the
                  great truths that I would promulgate? Would they live over it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Chopps, soothingly. "I think they would."</p>
               <p>I made up my mind immediately. There was to be an immense mass meeting that night
                  at somebody's hall, in some ward or other, and some great man was going to make a
                  speech. I must be there to get "the points." Chopps said he would go with me and
                  "show me through." Punctual as clockwork, he appeared at 8 P.M., and we started
                  for the love-feast. We approached a little old dingy building, the character of
                  which I did not understand. Seeing a transparency in front of the door with
                  letters on it, I suspected it said "meals at all hours," but upon a closer
                  scrutiny I discovered the words to be "support Congress." I remarked incidentally
                  that I thought that injunction quite superfluous, for, with the agility Congress
                  displayed in voting itself salaries, it ought to be able to support itself.</p>
               <p>"Hush!" said Chopps, "dont talk that way here, you'll be gutted."</p>
               <p>I sloped. I came, I saw, I skedaddled. I always had a horror of being
                  disemboweled, and yet, from my infancy, I have had a superstition that I would
                  perish in that way. Falstaff's terror of drowning was not greater than is mine of
                  being dismembered from my in'ards. I ran I don't deny it. Old Chopps gave chase,
                  shouting at the top of his voice, which was a very tall one, "come back!" Little
                  boys in the street added "Stephen!" Old men and young cried "stop thief!" The
                  police surrounded me and I gave in. "Hello! old hoss!" said a low-born fellow,
                  seizing me by the arm, "are you running for office?" "No," I replied as soon as I
                  recovered in breath, "I am running for an officer." Old Chopps came up, puffing
                  like a locomotive. He told the police to let me go, which they did. Then he said
                  he was only in fun, and I wouldn't be hurt for the world, and all that. I finally
                  started with him again, but I felt uneasy.</p>
               <p>We entered the dingy little house, and I felt relieved. There was a man in
                  convulsions on a platform, a chap with a number on his hat sitting in a corner
                  asleep, two or three men with pipes in their mouths, half a dozen representatives
                  of Fatherland huddled together, and about fifty empty chairs. That was all I could
                  see. I had scarcely glanced about the room when a voice behind me sung out:</p>
               <p>"Sit you down dere, fat mans. Vat you dinks, eh? Dinks you I see through a tam
                  elephant."</p>
               <p>"See here, my gentle Teuton," I said, "Ich nicht Deutsche sprechen, but unless you
                  modify your language<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5851-00000022"/> guage a little
                  hereafter when addressing yourself to me, my impression is that I shall yield to a
                  natural impulse and tap your beer barrel."</p>
               <p>"Hit you from der shoulder?" quoth Germany, mounting to his pins and squaring
                  off.</p>
               <p>"Not much," quoth the subscriber, "I hit from the breast-pocket," and suiting the
                  action to the word, I thrust my hand in my bosom. Bismark wilted, with whole
                  sections of Col. Colt's artillery swimming before his frenzied vision, no doubt.
                  It was fortunate for him that my meerschaum pipe was not loaded.</p>
               <p>"What ails that man in the pulpit?" I asked old Chopps, when peace had been
                  declared.</p>
               <p>"Him?" said the ever accomodating Chopps, "why he's making a speech."</p>
               <p>I never should have known it. He made so much noise I couldn't hear him.</p>
               <p>"These are all loyal men," continued my companion, "you'll find no copperheads
                  here."</p>
               <p>"No sapheads, either, I suppose," said I, as the speaker took a breath.</p>
               <p>No reply.</p>
               <p>"That man," observed Chopps, "is one of the great leaders of our party. It would
                  rend your heart-strings to hear what he has suffered for his bleeding country. At
                  the beginning of the war he was a rebel, fought in the rebel army, and Government
                  confiscated all his property. Yet with all these calamities to sustain, when he
                  discovered his error he abandoned the sinking cause and came over to our party,
                  and our magnanimous Government forthwith restored his possessions. Now he is the
                  chief corner stone of our temple. A great man is that, Mr. Le Connor, a great
                  man!"</p>
               <p>I was so carried away by this pathetic panegyric that I exclaimed: "Je—whillikens!
                  can it be? Wonder if I could get a lock of his whiskers or a piece of his ear to
                  remember him by?"</p>
               <p>Chopps looked sanctimonious and shook his head.</p>
               <p>"What is he doing now?" I queried, as he came down on the table with his fist like
                  a thousand of brick, and stared furiously at an empty bench directly in front of
                  him; "is he mad?"</p>
               <p>My cyclopedia informed me that he was expounding the principles of the New
                  Constitution. I ventured to observe that that table would be pretty well expounded
                  if his wrath increased much more. Nobody laughed. A poor place for jokes is a
                  Puritan meeting. Chopps said I must be patient and I would see something. The
                  crowds would begin to pour in soon. I waited for the pour. Meantime I directed my
                  attention to the roaring young lion that occupied the stand, and was able now and
                  then to catch a word of his address. It was after this fashion:</p>
               <p>"Villainous—ah—seek to—ah—overthrow Government—ah—infernal traitor, Andy
                  Johnson—(whew!)—all traitors—ah—cut-throats and murderers—ah—every man in
                  Democratic party—(whew!) liars and poltroons—ah—Johnson, Seward and the whole
                  pack—ah—"</p>
               <p>"Hold on—ah—hold on!" I said, rising to my feet and darting toward the
                  platform.</p>
               <p>"Come back," shrieked Chopps, seizing hold of my coat-tail. "Where are you
                  going?"</p>
               <p>"Going to punch the head of that untamed animal<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000023"/> mal," I said; "I won't sit here and hear
                  respectable men abused in that way."</p>
               <p>"Sh-sh-sh! Come back and sit down, he don't mean it. You must always talk that way
                  when you are making a speech."</p>
               <p>"O-ho! it is in the play, is it?" says I.</p>
               <p>"Of course it is," says he.</p>
               <p>"Then why didn't you say so," says I, "I tho't he was 'gagging' the piece."</p>
               <p>I calmed myself. Pretty soon the fiery dragon played out. He pounded both fists
                  black and blue, besides bursting off all his shirt buttons, and then sank down
                  from sheer exhaustion. Chopps yelled for me. The other inmates of the place took
                  up the cry, although they hadn't the remotest idea what they were calling for.
                  Seeing I was in for it, I took the stand, removed my cravat, rolled up my sleeves,
                  and went in. Following is my speech:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>FELLOW-CITIZENS—(Barring the Dutchman over there that called me an
                     elephant)—You all know my views. (If they did they were a great deal wiser than
                     I.) You also know how I regard Andrew Johnson. (Cries of "That's so;" "Go for
                     him;" "Give him fits," &amp;c. Here the man with the door-plate on his hat woke
                     up.) When that arch traitor (great applause); when that hoary-headed
                     blackguard—("bully for you," "that's the talk; that suits us";) that envoy
                     extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from the regions of darkness,
                     desolation and death, (here the cheering was absolutely overpowering; I was
                     compelled to stop my ears with my fingers); that living, moving, thinking sum
                     of all villanies, Thad. Stevens—</p>
               </q>
               <p>Fortunately there was but one light in the room, and that was a tallow candle. The
                  first chair hurled at me struck it and left us all in the dark. I could hear them
                  rushing toward the stand, and I made for the door. That was a sympathizing crowd.
                  They couldn't see me, but they all felt for me. On they came, and on I went. Came
                  in violent contact with the globe-like form of Old Chopps. Just for fun I tipped
                  him over, and cried out, "Here, boys, I've got him!" Old C. being of about my
                  shape and dimensions, the mob was easily misled, and they piled on to him three
                  deep. As I made my exit at the front door I heard him screaming for quarter. I am
                  sure he never got it; there was not a quarter in all that crowd. Once outside, two
                  or three of them recognized me by the gas-light, and, O parsimmons! didn't they
                  freeze to me like a hired man? I said something about free speech. They replied
                  with something like freebooters, illustrating their remarks with practical
                  demonstrations. I bore up under it (or before it) until I reached a pile of
                  bricks, when I turned upon my assailants, and you should have seen them scatter.
                  Again I was master of the situation, and deeming discretion the better part of
                  valor, I broke down the street as hard as I could tear. It takes a strong man to
                  break down a street, but I did it, nevertheless. The crowd followed. Being closely
                  pressed again, and the brickbats flying rather profusely about my ears, I seized a
                  nigger baby out of its mother's arms and held it up to the excited rabble. The
                  effect was magical. Brickbats stopped flying in a minute. It was a grand and
                  impressive spectacle—little Ethiop shielding me from danger. Beat the Wept of the
                  Wishton-Wish all hollow. Fact is, I learned the dodge from Naramattah, and I thank
                  her muchly. Despite the entreaties of the agonized mother, I clung to<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000024"/> that little nigger till I was out of danger, when I
                  yielded it up. Beneath the friendly roof of Blisshovel I blessed my stars, and
                  having repeated "Now I lay me——" retired, to dream of Radicalism, Vondooism, and
                  every other sort of ism, till morning. I don't want to see Old Chopps till this
                  day seven years. When we meet there will be oil spilt, certain; and I don't want
                  to see it.</p>

                  spider does flies, for a miserable existence—no, sir! for I've struck the right

                  and victory perches on my bloody bandana like a heroic rooster on a barn door. I'm

                  old sound, substantial, machine sense, (however disagreeable it may be to me to go
                  back on poetry,) I've struck a good thing and made a pile (no allusion to our M.
                  C.) Went in on my shape, speculated in railroads, (Broad<pb n="48-49"

                  world, all through a little skill in railroading. Railroad's the thing wherein to
                  make the fortunes of a "Ring." See it? Simple as checkers.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>How?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>How did <emph>Faro</emph> cross the Red Sea? Played it open, did he, and got a
                  bigger check than he ever dreamed of? Science. How did Hercules (Herc. of
                  antiquity) slay the Hydrant and cleanse the stables of Oregon? Did it all by main
                  force, did'nt he? Power? Shernanigan? Skulduggery? Of course he did. How did
                  Columbus discover America? How did Napoleon become Emperor? How did Hon. John
                  Morrisey get into Congress? How? No sane man ever ought to ask that question.
                  Nerve, brains, muscle, will. These words are sufficient answers to all the "hows"
                  this side of doomsday. Muster your courage to the front, give the command
                  "forward!" and go in. That was my policy, and behold me! A millionaire, a
                  railroadist, a success!</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>The motive?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Locomotive, of course. Money was the prime lever, my boy, money—bullion, l'argent,
                  ducats, livres, scudis, <emph>rocks</emph>. The interests of mankind generally are
                  controlled by the human mind; railroad interests by Hume and $30,000. Lucre's the
                  thing—lucre and luck. Heard the proverb of the lucky man, hav'nt you? Throw him in
                  the sea and he will come up with a fish in his mouth. Beat that myself. Jumped
                  headlong into the sea of speculation, and came up with a railroad in my mouth.
                  Marvellous road it is, too; value of it like the color of the chameleon—depends
                  altogether on the light you see it in. Stocks rise and fall in unison with
                  honesty, and it is pretty safe to prophesy, from present appearances, in a little
                  while the stock of the road will "go up." I'm interested. I am one of a "Ring"—a
                  ringer-in, and an active member of a live association that has for its object the
                  acquirement of railroads without money and without price; our motto, plain dealing
                  and plain stealing, founded in the spirit of the infallible proverb, "Honesty is
                  the best policy." In the innocent and exhilarating pastime herein denominated, I
                  expect to encounter overwhelming success.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Guilty conscience?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Skeleton in every man's closet, eh? So there is. Skeleton in every woman's closet,
                  too, for that matter. Skeleton skirt. What do I care? They may turn my closet into
                  an anatomical museum, with space set apart for a hospital and cemetery, if they
                  like; fill it chuck full of the unrecognizable bodies of maimed, mangled, and
                  otherwise mutilated human beings, with a sprinkling of ghosts, spectres and
                  hobgoblins. What matters it to me? Ain't I a millionaire? Troubled now and then
                  with an attack of nightmare, certainly; fancy I'm harnessed to a great, heavy
                  freight train, and compelled to draw it forever up an interminable hill, while
                  stones, apparently half as big as the universe, labelled "honesty," integrity,"
                  and so on, seem always ready to tumble on my head, and beneath is a seething
                  cauldron, marked "Public Opinion." Such pleasant visions are of common occurrence.
                  But, pshaw! What of that? I am opulent; I am an association—<emph>a Ring.</emph>
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5851-00000026"/> Work, you poor devils out in the street
                  there! Dig, dig, dig! O, but it's glorious to sit here in my luxurious parlor and
                  watch the great drops of perspiration trickling from your manly brows. Precious
                  globules! They are gold dollars dropping into my exchequer. Toil on, ye stalwart
                  freemen, and bless your lucky stars that you can work from sunrise to sunset for
                  means to pay taxes, and the law cannot punish you for it. Sweet are the uses of a
                  free government. Your toil pays taxes, taxes buy railroads, railroads become the
                  property of the State, and the State's trustworthy and responsible ministers,
                  (Heaven save the mark!) recognizing the worthiness and neediness of our
                  association, sell us the roads for a more vulgar fraction of their intrinsic
                  value. That's what we call a "heavy operation." Heavy, indeed; and that the State
                  does not expire from intestinal congestion is no fault of ours. We are patriots,
                  nevertheless; we vote right, and the poor, miserable public dare not question us.
                  Glorious country! Work, you freckled-faced, carrotty-headed, black-and-tan,
                  hickory-shirted, dirt-besprinkled, freeborn American citizens! Heave the mud-pile,
                  ply the spade, till you sweat blood, and the white hairs melt like a frost from
                  your worn-out pates! Work, work, work! What amusement for me—high cockleorum of
                  the Broad Gouge Road.</p>

                  <emph>Afraid of exposure?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Your grandmother's boot-jack. Suppose the Legislatures do appoint investigating
                  committees now and then, and suppose the newspapers do blow us up once in a while,
                  and charge us with corruption and robbery, and all that? Easy enough to get out of
                  it. Do as the monkeys do in Brazil when they want to cross a stream. One monkey
                  seizes a limb, another monkey takes hold of his tail, another <emph>his</emph>
                  tail, and so on till a long line is formed, then, swinging across, the last monkey
                  seizes a limb on the opposite side, and a bridge is formed over which the whole
                  tribe crosses; then the first monkey lets his hold go, and bridge and all is
                  landed safely on the other side. That's the ticket. If there is danger of getting
                  swamped, we will make a bridge of ourselves and swing out of the difficulty. If
                  the last monkey does get a ducking it won't hurt him much. Do him good, perhaps.
                  Besides, it will be a warning to the other monkeys.</p>
               <p>I'm an astonishing success, and I am tempted to exclaim "Heaven bless the man that
                  invented <emph>low bids.</emph> "The State evidently thinks the less money a man

               <head>A FAMILY MAN.</head>
               <p>I was travelling about seven years ago, on horseback, near the western border of
                  Missouri. What object I had in being there it is unnecessary to state, but for the
                  benefit of the timid-minded and the too-suspicious, I may be pardoned for saying
                  that I was neither jayhawking nor acting in the capacity of a highwayman—nor was I
                  a member of anybody's militia.</p>
               <p>It was Christmas, and there was a deep snow on the ground. The sun was just
                  sinking in the west behind a bank of ominous-looking clouds that prophesied a
                  snow-storm. I had ridden all day without passing any habitation save two or three
                  little log cabins that looked scarcely large enough to accommodate a single
                  inmate. I was considerably delighted therefore, when, about sunset, I came in
                  sight of a rather comfortable appearing house built of hewed logs, and standing in
                  the midst of a field that bore evidence of having produced a fair crop of corn the
                  previous season. As I drew near to the house, the dulcet strains of that amiable
                  tune commonly called "Rackensack," burst on my ears, wrung from the bowels of a
                  solitary fiddle. By and by I heard<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5851-00000030"/>
                  voices—a great many of them—and I was convinced that a merry-making was going on.
                  Just as I was felicitating myself upon the prospect of a night's enjoyment beneath
                  a comfortable roof, with the romantic accompaniment of old-fashioned pastime, my
                  eyes lit on a spectacle that for a moment staggered me; but I soon recovered, and
                  reining up my horse, I stopped for a good view of it. About a hundred yards from
                  the house, seated on an old log, was a brawny old man with a shaggy beard, and
                  clad in the raiment peculiar to that section. A white cloth was spread before him,
                  on which were some scraps of bread and meat, which he was endeavoring to devour in
                  the most selfish manner I ever saw. I don't know why, but I had an instinctive
                  perception that that man was the proprietor of the house.</p>
               <p>"Friend," said I, "why don't you go indoors to eat your supper?"</p>
               <p>He did not deign to look up, but he answered me. "A voice came like a falling
                  star," as Longfellow has it; a deep, sepulchral, awful voice:</p>
               <p>"None o' yer —— business."</p>
               <p>Looking at the matter in its legitimate light, perhaps he was correct, but I
                  thought he might have been less profane about it. The clouds in the west looked
                  too threatening for me to be put off so easily. "Rackensack" became more and more
                  enticing.</p>
               <p>"Can you keep me all night," I asked, timidly.</p>
               <p>"Can't keep nothin'," was the reply.</p>
               <p>It struck me he kept his equilibrium, at least. I tried a new "lead," in hopes of
                  coming to a better understanding.</p>
               <p>"Have there been many Eastern folks in these parts lately, for the purpose of
                  entering land?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"Yes, a good many on 'em has been out this way, and they generally enter land as
                  soon as they git here. We pop 'em over with a piece of cold lead, and chuck em
                  under the gravel. Don' want no caterlopers."</p>
               <p>I shuddered. More than ever was I determined not to proceed any further on a dark
                  road in a country where they popped people over.</p>
               <p>"My friend," I said, appealing to his finer sensibilities, "I suppose you have a
                  family?"</p>
               <p>He dropped his victuals and looked up. His eyes dilated, and the veins began to
                  swell in his neck. I thought something terrible was coming. Said he:</p>
               <p>"See here, stranger, I've took a good deal from you—more'n I ever did from any
                  other man. But let that pass a minit; I want to ax <emph>you</emph> a question.
                  Ain't <emph>you</emph> got a family?"</p>
               <p>"Not if I know myself."</p>
               <p>"What! Now looky here, Captain, don't try to come it over me. Ole Jack Hackbonny
                  ain't the man to be fooled with—dog my cats if he is. You ain't got no
                  family?"</p>
               <p>"Never was married in my life, as I am a Christian."</p>
               <p>"Major, I hain't got no right to dispute yer. That ere countenance o' yourn looks
                  tolerable honest like. Never had no wife?"</p>
               <p>"Never!"</p>
               <p>"Nor no children, nuther?"</p>
               <p>This latter question I thought it not worth while to<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000031"/> answer, as a moment's reflection must convince him
                  of its absurdity. He continued:</p>
               <p>"Kurnel, pledge me yer word and honor as a man yer never had no wife nor no
                  children, speshly darters, and I'm yer friend 'til deth."</p>
               <p>"I pledge, with all my heart."</p>
               <p>"Gineral, git down. Drap. I'll feed yer beast and you can go into the house.
                  Byme-by you'll git some supper, and I'll see that you have the best bed in the
                  house. Never was married! Well, by hokey!"</p>
               <p>I told him I would prefer to accompany him to the stable to see my "beast"
                  provided for; and as we proceeded on our way, my accommodating host discoursed as
                  follows:</p>
               <p>"S'pose you think old Jake Hackbonny's a curis critter. That's what they all say.
                  But I tell yer what it is, I've seed some mity hard times. A good many years ago I
                  got married out in Posey county, Indianny. I managed to pick up a purty good sort
                  of a gal. She was thrifty like, and knowed how to take keer o' things. So I moved
                  out here into Missouri, and cleers up a little patch o' ground, and builds me a
                  house. Now, sez I to my old woman, (she was a young gal, then, and a good natered
                  kind o' thing) sez I, "Polly," (that's my wife's name,) "Polly," sez I, "I don't
                  mind raisin' a family now. A family o' boys would be a mighty heap o' sarvice to
                  me in clearin' my ground and sich like, yer know." "Yes," sez she, "Jacob, boys is
                  mighty handy to a body when they git old and can't do for theirselves And she
                  kinder smiled, and everythin' went on very agreeable till byme-by we had a child
                  born. I paid an all-fired big doctor's bill, and had to do all the cookin' for a
                  whole week, and the consarn-ed young un was a gal! "Jacob," says Polly, "the
                  Lord's aginst us." "Yes," says I, "Polly, I reckon." I bore up under it, howsever,
                  and kep on workin' and gittin a little property together, and byme-by another gal
                  was born. That was a little more'n I could stand. The way I did swear was a sin, I
                  know. "Jacob," says my old woman, "this here's a cuss sent on yer for yer
                  wickedness" "Polly," says I, "I'xspeck so, and I'll try and do better." I did do
                  better a whole year, when another gal was born, and I ain't done better never no
                  more. I'll tell yer what it is, there was nine gals born one after another. It was
                  anuff to break up the richest man in the world. But my old woman she's purty
                  smart, so says she, "Jacob, you must make them gals work out. Make 'em earn their
                  own bread till they git old anuff to marry." I liked that idee fust rate, so I put
                  the oldest one to hoen corn and choppin' wood, and so on, and just as she got
                  larnt how, long comes a feller and marries her. That pleased me purty well, 'cause
                  I thought now I'd have one less to support, but in about a month her man took the
                  white-swellin' and he ain't been out o' the house sence. Then I larnt my next
                  oldest to work and she up and married right off; but she married a feller that
                  tried purty hard to git along in the world. He started to the gold diggins, and
                  the Injuns killed him. Now, his widder, and a helpless little offspring, is
                  throwed onto my hands. "Polly," says I, "this marryin's got to be stopped." "No,
                  no, Jacob," says she, "mebbe the rest on 'em'll have<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000032"/> better luck." So two more on 'em got married, and
                  daug gaun my skin if their husbands has ever done a lick o' work sence. They jist
                  lay round and live off o' me. And my old woman thinks thar never was sich men, and
                  says they ain't able to work There's been a mortal change in my old woman o late
                  years, sure's you're born. Well, they was all married but two at last, and all on
                  my hands still, when long comes a spruce lookin' town chap. Said he'd been to
                  Pike's Peak, and been robbed, and I don't know what all. He was an all-fired smart
                  feller. Could talk about anything, and used to tell murder stories for hours at a
                  time, and tickled my old woman and the gals almost to death, and the children was
                  awful skeered at him. He said he was a printer, and used to show us a little thin
                  piece of steel about two inches long that he called his "rule," and said that was
                  the key to any man's fortin. Then he talked a great lot about having rich parients
                  into the East somewhar', and said how he was expectin a printin orfis to be sent
                  to him up to St. Jo., and how he would like to stay with me a week or so till he
                  got his "stake," as he called it, and I was mighty willin' to keep him, cause he
                  was mighty interestin'—although he was a little expensive; cause my lazy,
                  good-for-nothin' son-in-laws staid in the house more'n ever now, and did'nt seem
                  to like for him to talk to their wives purty much. Well, I did'nt mind him, havin'
                  to be out nearly all the time tendin' to things, and so he got to cuttin' round
                  one o' my single gals, and one day he axed me for her. He said as how he would
                  take her to St. Jo., and make a lady on her; and I was so powerful glad to git one
                  on 'em off my hands, that I was willin' right off. Away he went for old preacher
                  Barnes, over by Parker's mill—the same one that married all the rest on 'em—and
                  they spliced. Then he laid round for a week or sich a matter, and one day he says
                  to me as how his printin orfis had come to St. Jo., and if he'd only fifty dollars
                  to pay for shippin' it, he could set right up in business. Well, me and Polly had
                  managed to scrape together a little money by sellin' roots and feathers and one
                  thing and another, and so I lends him fifty dollars, though it was about all I
                  had. He starts up to St. Jo, and says he: "I'll be back in a week for my wife."
                  That was little more'n a year ago, and I hain't never seed hair nor hide o' that
                  ar printer from that day to this. Let another on 'em ever poke his head around me,
                  and if I don't rip his jugular, my name ain't Jacob Hackbonny. Now comes a feller
                  and wants to marry the last darter I've got, to be another load on my shoulders. I
                  was gine to shoot him, but my old woman puts in her gab (she ain't what she used
                  to be,) and says as how its mighty pleasant to have a body's children with 'em in
                  their old days anyhow." Think of that! Well, Ginral, there'll be another weddin'
                  here to-night they all think, but I reckon as how they'll laff when they find out
                  better. That ar "shepherd," as my old woman calls him, old man Barnes, won't marry
                  many more couples, I reckon. He comes through the woods tonight, and I've got some
                  friends lookin' for him as'll put him where marryin' won't win. But les go in,
                  Ginral, whar you can git a bite to eat. Ther's twenty-three people in that house,
                  incloodin big and little, children and grandchildren and valable son-in-laws,<pb
                     n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5851-00000033"/> and there ain't but one room to the
                  house, but you shall have the best bed in it. You ain't got no family, and you're
                  my friend."</p>
               <p>I drew a long breath when the old man finished his windy story. I could not help
                  sighing when I thought of the "shepherd," but knowing my inability to save him, I
                  resolved to make the most of a night's lodging, and be off by times in the
                  morning.</p>
               <p>I entered the house, and the appearance of the company certainly was most
                  striking. In addition to the regular twenty-three inmates, a great many visitors
                  had come to be present at the wedding, so that the house was literally crammed
                  full. The son-in-law with the white-swelling ceased sawing on his old fiddle. I
                  replenished the inner man, and soon began to make myself agreeable. While waiting
                  for the parson, several plays were proposed, in all of which I took part. One I
                  remember very distinctly. Some one, usually one of the "gals" first, sat in the
                  middle of the room, while all the rest of the party marched round her in a circle,
                  singing: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"O sister Phebe, how merry were we,</l>
                        <l>The night we sat under that juniper tree,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-4">That juniper tree, I-O.</l>
                        <l>Take this hat on your head, keep your head warm,</l>
                        <l>And take a sweet kiss, it will do you no harm,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-4">But a great deal of good, I know."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the young lady "goes for" her choice, and fires one at him broadside—not
                  one of your theatrical hoaxes, but a regular columbiad kiss, that makes the welkin
                  fairly ring. The lucky young man then sits down and goes through the same ordeal.
                  I got on all right till I had to take the chair, and when it came my turn to
                  select a favorite, I picked on the bride elect. A scuffle ensued, she of course
                  resisting, which was very proper, and in the scuffle something flew out of my
                  pocket and rattled on the hearth. "O how purty!" cried a little urchin who picked
                  it up. "One o'them keys to fortin, by thunder!" shouted the old man, "Sir," said I
                  hastily, "let me explain." "You are a printer," said he. "I have been an innocent
                  speculator for years," I replied; "once I was a print—"</p>
               <p>"My shot-gun! boys, git a rope," broke in the old monster, and I broke out at the
                  door. I had no difficulty in finding my horse, and I saddled him hastily, and as
                  he cleared the fence with me on his back, two charges of shot passed in dangerous
                  proximity to my upper story. I rode ten miles through the dark and cold, before I
                  found a hospitable roof—thinking all the time of that sage remark, "there is a
                  divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them as we will." I never heard from the
                  nuptials, but presume they did not transpire that night, at least.</p>
               <p>I have travelled some in Western Missouri since the above event occurred, but I
                  always take care not to have a printer's rule with me.</p>

                  <p>Well, we all got on2 the beests and started. Liz wonted me to ride nex to
                     Sukey, but i sed not fur 10 thousand worlds. I was ridin a nu saddle and it

                     sege to hold him. it was a grate releef when we got to meetin, but thar i had
                     to set in the middle of the conkergashun between them 2 gals with everiboddis
                     i's on2 me.</p>
                  <p>"Reub," sez Liz tu me, in a whisper jist afore the preecher was dun blowin his
                     horn, "go and git the horses reddy."</p>
                  <p>That was pesimons for me. i went out &amp; put the saddles on &amp; tide the
                     horses to a fens &amp; jumped over into a medder witch the gras was sum 4 feet
                     hi &amp; hid. Sez i tha may git hum as best tha kin; i never will ride that nu
                     saddle in kumpny agin.</p>
                  <p>&amp; thar i lay in the warm sunshine on my downy kouch of gras, &amp; i heerd
                     the hum of voices cummin out of the meetin house, &amp; i kood see the crowd.
                     Thar was Sukey luvly as the Dooy Morn, &amp; fresh as the full blowed rose. i
                     felt sumthin like lizards runnin up &amp; down mi bak &amp; mi hart was gettin

                     "i doo wunder!" sez Sukey. I didn't say nuthin.</p>
                  <p>Jist then i heerd a strane of mellerdy witch seemed to issoo from the urth
                     underneeth me, it was a lo sweet sound like the moosic of the spears, I thort.
                     "Gentel June-bug," I moozed, "tile on, tile on," but the strane grode louder,
                     &amp; i sed tu myself it is 100—nay it is 1,000 gentle June-bugs, when—o
                     horror—i flu up in2 the are near 70 feet and lit down head bottommost and heels
                     uppermost, and i roled and turned hand-springs and summer sets and the croud
                     screamed, for i was in grate agerny.</p>
                  <p>Fackt is, I had sot down on2 a large and appresheativ Bumble Beeze nest, witch
                     sed Bumble Beeze nest wos ful to overfloin, and tha had giv me a turn witch wos
                     as unlookdfor as it wos unegspeckted. The Bumble Beez as a class is a noin
                     race, and tha don't never cum out of ther 40fikashuns 1 at a time like the

                     tha hit ennything tha make it houle. So al so did i houle, and i roared in
                     mizzory likewize. The beeze lit all over me, &amp; the wimmen all run, for tha
                     wos skeered in2 a geminy fit, but the men beet em off (the beeze,) with weeds,
                     and when I cud stand erekt onse more, the gals cum back.</p>
                  <p>"Reub," sez Liz, "whar ar you hurt?"</p>
                  <p>"Nunner yor darned bizness," sez I, witch wos onbrotherly i no, but it wos

               <head>A MODEL MEMBER OF THE SANITARY POLICE.</head>
               <p>Through some inexplicable freak of fortune the city was led, a short time since,
                  to acknowledge the claims of a long and ardent worker for the public good, and
                  accordingly I was appointed a Street Inspector, to look after the sanitary
                  condition of the city. Said the venerable and distinguished gentleman from whom I
                  received my charge: "Sir, it is time for us to be awake (looked about me to see
                  who was asleep); you remember the terrible scenes of last summer; we must prepare
                  to guard against a recurrence of those. Warm weather is rapidly approaching, sir;
                  I put some sweet milk in my cellar last night, and it soured in less than three
                  hours." "Pshaw," said I, "that's nothing; I put some sweet milk in my stomach last
                  night, and it soured in less than three minutes." Venerable gentleman frowned
                  faintly and proceeded: "It will be your duty to inspect thoroughly the sanitary
                  condition of streets, alleys, and all kinds of houses in your district, and you
                  will demand the immediate removal of whatever is there discovered that is
                  offensive or dangerous to the public health, and it shalt furthermore be your duty
                  to enforce compliance with all such demands."</p>
               <p>"Good morning," I said, and bowing myself out of<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000040"/> the presence of the venerable gentleman, I entered
                  upon my duties at once.</p>
               <p>"Sorry to trouble you," I commenced, as I came suddenly in contact with an outre
                  specimen of the genus homo on Fourth street, clad in a ring-tail coat, tight
                  inexpressibles and a quizzing-glass, "sorry to trouble you, sir, but you must
                  forsake the city at once; no words, but away—vamooose! I am an Inspector;
                  authorized to remove anything and everything dangerous to the public health; pity
                  you, sir, but can't help you; it makes me sick to look at you; therefore,
                  skedaddle; stand not upon the order or your going, but go at once." Eccentric
                  looking chap stared a moment, and then vanished like a poor man's memory on rent
                  day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Memorandum.—Inspectorship big thing; no trouble at all; anybody can
                  do it first time he tries.</p>
               <p>"Sorry, indeed, sir," I said, approaching rather a towering middle-aged man who
                  stood on a street corner inhaling the delicious fragrance of a two-shilling
                  Havana, "sorry, very sorry to interfere with you, sir, but you must throw away
                  that cigar. Cigars, sir, have been decided by the highest medical authority to be
                  injurious to health, and I am authorized to remove such articles wherever found.
                  Please discard." The middle-aged man replied in three words, in which he desired
                  me to visit a region popularly believed to be several degrees hotter than is often
                  experienced in this latitude, even in the hottest season. Thereupon I asserted the
                  dignity of my office by knocking the cigar out of his mouth. He turned to an
                  acquaintance to inquire if I was insane, and I marched away triumphantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mem.—Inspectorship romantic; people take you for a madman because
                  you discharge your duty; lots of fun.</p>
               <p>"Beg pardon, madame (approaching a resplendent lady standing on the steps of her
                  residence); beg a thousand pardons; really, ma'am, this is a very delicate
                  subject, and I assure you that nothing but a strict sense of duty could impel me
                  to this measure (lady begins to smile and courtesy); my position is not one of
                  choice, ma'am; I am a public servant; I am authorized to remove whatever endangers
                  the health of our citizens, and—really, ma'am, I beg ten thousand pardons—that
                  paint must come off your face." A delicate scream, which might have aroused the
                  the dead, and might not, broke on the stillness of the mid-day air, the door was
                  slammed shut with such a bang that the concussion staggered me, and her ladyship
                  disappeared, shouting "husband!" at the very summit of her sweet little voice.
                  Queer, I thought, but what was I to do? My duty must be performed. Paint, as all
                  the world knows, is injurious to health—the fact has been demonstrated by chemical
                  analysis—and my course was unavoidable. Such were my musings as I sauntered
                  away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mem.—Stubborn woman at No.— ——— street, would'nt wash her face;
                  return in two hours, and if the paint is not removed must take the law into my own
                  hands and remove it myself.</p>
               <p>"What are you?" roared a pompous old beet-face from a third-story window, as he
                  discovered me climbing over a picket fence in the rear of his house. "Me? I'm a
                  disinfectant. Pray, what are <emph>you</emph>, Sir Insolence?" Beet-face
                  disappeared. I leaped into<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5851-00000041"/> the yard and
                  was compelled to clench my nose with both hands to keep from fainting. In another
                  moment pompous old gent. confronted me. "Well, sir, and what do you want?" said
                  he. "I want to inform you that I am an Inspector, and you must deodorize these
                  premises or you will be punished." "Mercy on me, you don't say so?" groaned the
                  unhappy owner of the sanguinary face. I did say so, though, notwithstanding. Old
                  gent. said the women had been in the habit of emptying slops in the yard. I rather
                  thought they had. He asked me what was the best deodorizer. I gave him a recipe:
                  "To three barrels of last year's milk, add twenty-four pounds asafœtida and about
                  a dozen dead cats. Let it stand till the cats are dissolved. Sprinkle your
                  premises with this mixture three times a day for three weeks, and I think the odor
                  will be improved." Old gent. promised to commence deodorizing immediately,
                  according to this new method, and I went away satisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mem.—Met an old gentleman who couldn't smell much; wonder if he had
                  any mucous membrane; must see about it.</p>
               <p>Rang the door-bell of a silver-plated mansion. Little Ethiopian answered the call.
                  Looked out and said, "g'way from here, missus don't want no beggars," and he
                  slammed the door in my face. I'll get even with that little nigger yet, one of
                  these days. Entered a street in the south part of the city, not far from the
                  river. Phew! I have lived much and traveled some, but I never came in contact with
                  a street like that before. The first thing that attracted my attention, aside from
                  the odor that prevailed, was a band of about a dozen little Black Crooks wallowing
                  in the streets. What was the original color of these youngsters I couldn't exactly
                  make out. I asked one of them what man was created from. "Dirt!" he replied. No
                  wonder he thought so. His knowledge was not acquired, however; it was
                  intuitive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mem.—Great discovery; soap factories don't manufacture enough soap;
                  cause of all the sickness; must recommend Government to establish soap factories
                  in all parts of the country; immortalize myself.</p>
               <p>Tackled a few huts by the way-side and demanded admission. "What are you?" says
                  one. "An inspector," says I. "O, you've come to put the rents up on us poor
                  critters, have ye? O ye miserable rascal." That was enough—that spark fired the
                  train. In two minutes the whole street was in an uproar, and men, women and
                  children, with hair streaming and with no hair at all, in all sorts of apparel,
                  and with very little apparel at all, were flying toward me from every direction. I
                  called to them to pause. There was no pause there. Would they listen? Never!
                  Buckets and brooms, pokers and brickbats began to darken the air, which, from the
                  very intensity of its odor seemed about the consistency of molasses. I don't think
                  my heart weakened a particle; my courage did'nt fail, but my olfactories did. When
                  I smelt them coming with their buckets of slop I fled indiscriminately. Over the
                  heads of urchins, and through throngs of slattern women, and under the rocks and
                  sticks of the infuriated men, that seemed doing a demon dance around, and above
                  and beneath me; through the consolidated perfume of decayed onions, live Africans,
                  slaughter-houses, dead<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5851-00000042"/> rats, and a
                  thousand and one other luxuries, on I sped, until I found myself clasped as if in
                  a vice in the arms of a revolving Amazon. Around and around we waltzed; she
                  wouldn't let go and I couldn't, and at last, O, horror! some shameless wretch, who
                  thought we were fighting, and that I was about to triumph, dashed a bucket of
                  spoiled krout on our heads and shoulders to separate us. That capped the climax;
                  it needed not half that much to finish me; I fell senseless to the ground, and
                  awoke in the Health Office. The police had rescued me. My first words on
                  recovering deserve to be recorded, not as the last words of a dying man, but as
                  the first words of a resurrected one.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I resign!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Venerable man said I must not think of it; I would like the business better when I
                  got used to it. Grey hairs saved him. No, sir; I would resign peremptorily. Who
                  was to pay me for my fine white patent paper-fronted shirt and my now spring
                  harness, now ruined forever, and who would compensate me for the loss of my
                  precious appetite for months to come? Would the city do that? Not much! No, sir;
                  take your Inspectorship and keep it. If the city desires to remunerate me for my
                  public services with such appointments, the city has a perfect right to do so; but
                  the city is confoundedly mistaken if it thinks I am going to serve. Henceforth I
                  shall devote my time and talents to keeping myself and my own premises
                  disinfected, and go upon the broad principle of "every man his own
                  deodorizer."</p>

               <head>REPORT OF A SCIENTIFIC SURVEY.</head>
               <p>An enterprise which has for a long time been dormant, couchant, or levant, as the
                  case may have been, is once more furiously and irrepressibly rampant, thanks to a
                  well directed and persistent fanaticism. There is nothing like agitation; toot
                  your horn if you don't sell a clam, for your reward cometh after.</p>
               <p>At a meeting of the "Opposition Bridge Association, for the speedy construction of
                  a bridge over the Mississippi river, uniting East St. Louis and St. Louis Proper,
                  and the erection of bridges generally," Mr. Fretmore presided.</p>
               <p>[Following is an authentic account of proceedings, as furnished by a disinterested
                  reporter.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowcraft moved that the Association are now prepared to listen to any report
                  from Prof. Hans Patrick Le Connor, chief engineer of a surveying and exploring
                  party, appointed with full power to examine and report plans and specifications
                  for a bridge across the Mississippi river, etc, etc.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smashpipes.—Would the gentleman please state in what manner the aforesaid Hans
                  Patrick, &amp;c., (his memory was very unretentive,) had been clothed with such
                  authority?</p>

               <p>Mr. Bowcraft.—He was so clothed by a series of resolutions, passed at the last
                  meeting of this Association. Would the gentleman like to hear the resolutions?</p>
               <p>Mr. Smashpipes would like to hear the resolutions. He had not been present at the
                  last meeting, and he believed he had a right to demand the reading of the

               <list>
                  <item>"1. Whether, in the opinion of the Professor and his corps of engineers, the
                     bridge should be at a sufficient height above the surface of the water to allow
                     boats and other vessels to pass under it, or,</item>
                  <item>"2. Whether it should be built at a sufficient depth below the surface of
                     the water to allow boats and other vessels to pass <emph>over</emph> it.
                     Also,</item>
                  <item>"3. Whether it would be cheaper for the Association to have the bridge
                     constructed at this point, or at some other point, and removed hither,
                     and,</item>
                  <item>"4. Whether it is most expedient to span the river with a single large
                     bridge, or with a variety of small bridges.</item>
               </list>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That the Corps of Engineers be instructed to visit and
                  examine some noted bridges—the Victoria bridge, the London bridge, and the
                  celebrated Bridge of Sighs, for instance—and report if they deem it advisable to
                  imitate in any respect those works of art.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That the Engineers be also requested to report any
                  discoveries of rare phenomena in nature, and other matters of interest, and that
                  they be furnished with a boat suitable for the voyage, necessary instruments, four
                  dozen sandwiches and two gallons of rum, at their own expense."</p>
               <p>The resolutions were adopted amid much applause.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowcraft said a resolution inquiring into the practicability of purchasing the
                  Lake Tunnel at Chicago, and removing it to this city, had been voted down.</p>
               <p>At this stage of the proceedings, the Professor was unanimously invited inside the

                              <p>Early on the morning of the 4th, the entire corps assembled on the
                                 levee, nigh unto the foot of Olive street. This remarkable strip of
                                 the habitable globe (the levee) is situated on the west bank of the
                                 Mississippi, and entirely within the temperate zone, although there
                                 is nothing in the habits of its people to indicate the fact. The
                                 chief articles of commerce here appeared to be oyster shells,
                                 antiquated tobacco quids and cigar stumps. An enterprising
                                 speculator might find a soap factory a profitable institution in
                                 this latitude, to work up the greasy old clothes that seem to grow
                                 spontaneously in little knolls and mounds near the water's edge.
                                 The inhabitants embraced representatives of the five grand tribes
                                 of the human race. A very extraordinary animal prevails here, known
                                 among men of science as the freed-men men," but which the natives
                                 call "nigger." We were much amused by some very young specimens,
                                 arrayed simply in a brief, home-spun garment, denominated a shirt,
                                 and were forcibly struck with the demand for improvement either in
                                 the animal or the attire. More shirt or less nigger would be highly
                                 acceptable to the more enlightened classes here abiding.</p>
                              <p>The boat chartered for the expedition was appropriately christened
                                 the "Bridget." She was a darling little craft, just large enough to
                                 carry our party. Having procured the two gallons of rum provided
                                 for in our commission, and half the number of sandwiches (that
                                 being ample), with other etceteras, we were ready for sail. Rumors
                                 were afloat that certain piratical looking vessels had been seen
                                 cruising about the opposite shore, and they were believed to be
                                 emissaries of the Wiggins Ferry Company, or the obscure projectors
                                 of some bridge enterprise, who were depositing torpedoes,
                                 fire-crackers and the like, in the river for the purpose of blowing
                                 us up. We were unterrified, however, and started on our perilous
                                 voyage with happy hearts and a propitious gale. Many a guffaw and
                                 old hat went up as we parted from the shore, but they were many
                                 miles away.</p>
                              <p>Our passage was smooth enough until about 200 yards from shore,
                                 when we encountered a severe rush of air, which was felt in the
                                 form of a whirl-wind, that came near capsizing us. Simultaneously
                                 with this catastrophe the cry of "pirate" was heard, and far to the
                                 east we beheld, sure enough, a frightful spectacle. Capt. Cute took
                                 a hasty glance through his double-barrelled cylinder escapement
                                    telescope,<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5851-00000045"/> and
                                 announced that a sailor on board the mysterious craft was nailing
                                 the black flag to her mast-head. Terror seized us all. In a few
                                 moments he relieved us by informing us that he was mistaken; it was
                                 the captain of a flat-boat who had been washing a dirty garment,
                                 and was hanging it out to dry. Joy beamed in our smiles again. But
                                 one peril vanished only to make way for another and a greater. We
                                 were now threatened with destruction by an invisible enemy. The
                                 atmosphere became terribly arid, and so great were its powers of
                                 absorption that it absorbed in a few moments the entire two gallons
                                 of rum, and its effect upon the brain was truly alarming. Young
                                 Wellington Waxworx was completely overcome, and rolled helpless on
                                 the floor of the boat. Finding it necessary to return to the
                                 western coast for supplies, we retraced our course to the foot of
                                 Olive street. The sandwiches had not been diminished by the strange
                                 atmosphere, and we concluded to throw them overboard, and take on
                                 two more gallons of rum instead. Young Wellington Waxworx being
                                 still insensible, we deposited him in an empty hogshead on the
                                 river bank and departed once more. But we could not avoid the
                                 terrible atmosphere; again it threatened us. Prof. Mixer here
                                 analyzed some of the water, and found it composed of 99 parts of
                                 Missouri mudum, and awful bad smellum (as he said) to only one part
                                 of the hydraulic fluid. No wonder we die! It is our belief,
                                 however, that a bridge may ultimately be built. Pillars may be
                                 preserved in this water, provided they are not pillars of salt.
                                 They should not be too near together so as to enable frogs, fleas,
                                 &amp;c., to leap from one to the other, as an exchange of these
                                 natural specimens between Illinois and Missouri is not desirable.
                                 We recommend, also, that the pillars be of stone or some other hard
                                 substance, and that the surface be perfectly smooth, as a
                                 protection against the building of mud-daubers' nests thereon. This
                                 will not be particularly beneficial to the public, but it will be
                                 such an excellent joke on the mud-daubers.</p>
                              <p>Again we were compelled to return, our supply of rum being
                                 exhausted, and all our company, except myself and one of the
                                 oarsmen, being in a state of unconsciousness, produced by the
                                 atmosphere. The sandwiches were still untouched. There was but one
                                 course left for us and that was to abandon the enterprise of the
                                 survey altogether for the present. Our unfortunate comrades were
                                 piled in a hogshead together and rolled to their respective homes
                                 by hands employed for the purpose, while the surviving oarsman and
                                 I wended our melancholy way to our domicils, and to bed, leaving
                                 our boats to the mercy of the waves.</p>
                              <p>It is our combined judgment and opinion that the proposed survey
                                 can only be effected in one way; that is to dig a canal, turn the
                                 course of the river out of its present channel, complete the
                                 survey, build the bridge, then turn the river back again.</p>

               <p>The report was received with prolonged cheers, the band played "Life on the Ocean
                  Wave," and there was great tumult.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5851-00000046"/>
               <p>Order being restored, Mr. Bowcraft moved that the Association award the eminent
                  Professor a silver medal, to be in the form of a <emph>brick</emph>, as evidence
                  of their appreciation of his character and services.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smashpipes moved to amend by striking out the words "silver" and "brick," and
                  inserting the words "leather" and "button." (Jeers and hisses.)</p>
               <p>The previous motion then prevailed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smashpipes attempted to denounce the expedition as a notorious failure, but he
                  was hooted down and the cry of envy raised.</p>
               <p>After the passage of resolutions to purchase a life-sized portrait of the
                  Professor for the Association, to appoint his biographer, and making provision for
                  a grand ball in honor of his achievement, the meeting adjourned.</p>
               <p>Here ends the reporter's notes. As anything further from me might be construed
                  into egotism, I will forbear. It is needless to add, however, that the bridge will
                  be built. I have received a telegram from James Gordon Bennett, Jr., tendering me
                  the yacht <hi rend="i"/>Henrietta, as "she lies off Cowes," but have declined this
                  gift. This establishment does not advertise in the N. Y. Herald.</p>

               <head>AN OVATION.</head>
               <p>A little circumstance has just occurred in my checkered career, which may be worth
                  publishing. Two afternoons ago I was reclining in an agreeable attitude in parlor
                  49 at the Southern, deeply absorbed in the perusal of a novel which I didn't know
                  the title of, when an elegantly attired gentleman, who has been trying to make me
                  believe for the last ten years that he is an acquaintance of mine, entered and
                  seated himself beside me. Tapping me gently on the shoulder, he said, in a voice
                  tremulous with emotion, and the effects of champagne and Havanas, "Hans, I've got
                  a good thing."</p>
               <p>I gazed on his expressive face; his radiant eyes met mine. I was overcome with
                  compassion, and this was my reply: "Sir, keep it."</p>
               <p>"But," continued my friend, confidentially, "you must listen; I have news that
                  will startle you. A stranger has arrived in the city—a countryman—with four
                  dollars in silver."</p>
               <p>I was thunderstruck. An invitation to attend the funeral of a creditor would not
                  have produced the effect on my nerves that this announcement did. My heart is not
                  adamant; I am human. I never was a banker, a railroad conductor, nor president of
                  a benevolent<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5851-00000048"/> nevolent society, and I
                  therefore know the value of money—good, hard, round, old-fashioned money. Is it a
                  wonder, then, that I rose to my feet hurriedly, dashed the novel down furiously,
                  grasped my friend frantically, and rushed with him out of the house immediately? I
                  think not.</p>
               <p>As soon as we reached the sidewalk, I whispered in the ear of my companion, "Where
                  is he?"</p>
               <p>He whispered in my ear, "At the Pacific depot." Then we whispered in each other's
                  ears and started.</p>
               <p>When we arrived at the depot we found it surrounded by an impenetrable concourse
                  of people.</p>
               <p>I inquired the cause, and my friend told me they had all come for the same purpose
                  that we had—to see the man who was the legal possessor of four dollars in silver.
                  The news of his arrival had spread like wild-fire, or camphor, I forget which.
                  "There is not much of a chance for us," said he, "but I thought you would like to
                  know what was going on."</p>
               <p>"I will see him," said I, and thereupon I commenced bounding over the heads of the
                  excited multitude like an antelope. My friend, like another antelope, followed at
                  my heels. We arrived in the centre of the throng, and I beheld the stranger.
                  People were crowding upon him to get a shake of his hand. I wanted a fair shake
                  myself, and I saw that something must be done speedily, or my hopes of a sudden
                  acquisition of wealth would be blasted. I mounted the rostrum (it was the worst
                  rostrum I ever saw; a wheelbarrow with all the wheels broken off except one), and
                  I made a speech—a regular rip-roaring, chain-lightning speech. I proclaimed to the
                  assemblage that the stranger was my guest; I had letters in my possession
                  recommending him to my hospitality. I knew him to be a worthy gentleman, and I
                  intended to receive him kindly. Those persons who desired to make his
                  acquaintance, could accompany him and me to my home. (<emph>Private</emph>—I never
                  knew I had a home till a sheriff came one morning with a sincere attachment for
                  some of my personal effects, to satisfy a debt of rent.) I told them I would
                  welcome them all to my house, but they must not press round the visitor now, for I
                  would hire somebody to lick the man who dared to lay violent hands upon him.</p>
               <p>My last remark struck the recipient of the compliment very forcibly. He was
                  alarmed a little, and looked upon me as a generous friend. He approached me. I
                  saluted him, and he froze to me. I was happy.</p>
               <p>Twenty minutes to two a procession was formed, to accompany me and my
                  distinguished guest to my residence. The following was the</p>

                  intended for one. When we arrived at my dwelling, and everybody was satisfied that
                  I didn't live on top of the house, because I lived on the next thing to it, I
                  caused a magnificent banquet to be spread, when the following bill of fare was
                  served, which I think challenges comparison in the annals of banquets:</p>

               </list>
               <p>The first thing my honorable guest did, on seating himself at the table, was to
                  inquire if I had any coffee. I told him the coffee had not boiled yet, but I could
                  furnish him with splendid ice cream, highly seasoned. He devoured a dish of it,
                  and called for an icicle to pick his teeth with. The important truth suddenly
                  flashed across my mind that he was fearfully and wonderfully green, and that I
                  would have no difficulty in becoming the rightful owner of four dollars in
                  silver.</p>
               <p>The coffee boiled at length, and for twenty-five minutes coffee and ice cream
                  suffered untold horrors. In the course of the gastronomical onslaught somebody
                  called for a toast. "Bring me one, too," roared the countryman, "ice cream and
                  coffee is played out; I've sot here and eat and drunk till the coffee is melting
                  the cream, and the cream is freezing the coffee, and my stomach don't understand
                  herself. Bring me a toast with some butter on it."</p>
               <p>It pained me to the quick to know that there was no butter toast on the bill of
                  fare, and that the gentleman who was suffering from the indisposition of ice cream
                  and coffee to mingle agreeably together, would have to let his stomach remain in
                  blissful ignorance of "her" condition.</p>
               <p>When the sumptuous repast had been dispatched, I proposed to show the visitor
                  through my apartments while the other guests remained seated.</p>
               <p>As we strolled together through halls, corridors, closets and attics, I asked him
                  if he knew that silver coin had grown to be very despicable in the eyes of
                  respectable people. He replied that he had been informed of the fact, but somebody
                  had told him while he was on his way to the city, that the Southern States were in
                  rebellion, and he thought if such was the case, silver would be worth something in
                  a year or two. He would therefore cling to the coins he possessed.</p>
               <p>If I ever meet the man who told him the Southern States were in rebellion, I shall
                  be tempted to inflict upon him bodily injury.</p>
               <p>I showed him my two celebrated dogs, Romulus and Remus. Told him they were named
                  in honor of two famous Wolverines of Michigan, who were suckled by a she-wolf in
                  their infancy, and afterwards founded the city of Rome, N. Y. Told him that their
                  praises had been sung in rhyme by Scotland's favorite poet, Burns, and that they
                  were universally<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5851-00000050"/> admitted to be the best
                  canines that had flourished since the days of old dog Tray. Concluded by telling
                  him I would sell them for four dollars, cash.</p>
               <p>He replied that he had more dogs at home than I could shake a stick at. With my
                  limited knowledge of mathematics, I was unable to decide on short notice what
                  number that would be, but I saw there was no chance for a speculation on the
                  dogs.</p>
               <p>I next showed him my library, consisting of a copy of Fox's Book of Martyrs and a
                  file of THE REPUBLICAN. Showed him a copy of the paper containing one of my
                  letters; expected his eye would light on my name first thing; that he would be
                  astonished to find me in the public prints, and would fall on his knees and
                  worship me. Instead of that he read all the other news and literature in the
                  paper, and commenced reading the advertisements, without paying any attention to
                  the letter. That was more than I could bear, and I called his attention to it. He
                  read it, and I asked him what he thought of it. He wanted to know if Jonah had a
                  copy of it in his pocket when the whale swallowed him. I told him I was not aware
                  that such was the case, and desired to know his reasons for such a supposition. He
                  said he had no reason, (I think he was right,) but he knew "Jonah had something
                  with him that made the whale powerful sick."</p>
               <p>I begged him to drop the subject; told him that flattery was very distasteful to
                  me, and I could not bear to be the subject of a conversation.</p>
               <p>I exhibited to his astonished gaze an electro-magnetic battery—a very elegant one,
                  for which I paid forty dollars. I have heretofore used the instrument ment every
                  day when I thought a bill was about to be presented to me for payment. One shock
                  prepared me for another. It was very useful to me, and almost indispensable. My
                  friend, at my request seized the wires. I turned the crank until a current was
                  produced, and asked him what he thought of it. He said it was "awful." "Yes," said
                  I, "it is shocking." As soon as he became well acquainted with it, however, he
                  wanted it. He said the girls in his neighborhood would be tickled to death by it.
                  I told him if there was any danger of such a calamity resulting from its use, I
                  would not permit it to go into his neighborhood, for I should not like to be the
                  means of any man's being convicted of woman-slaughter. He then promised to use it
                  moderately till they got used to it, and I told him I would sell it, for four
                  dollars in silver. No sooner said than done; he came down with the coin.</p>
               <p>It is almost useless for me to attempt a description of the manner in which I
                  acted. I took no thought of the persons who were still at table. I did not pause
                  to wrap up the battery even, but rushed madly down stairs into the open air, and
                  never stopped till reached Fourth street. I knew a silverware merchant to whom I
                  could sell the four silver dollars for $400 in currency. He wanted them to put in
                  his windows to attract customers. I knew my business, and I felt huge. I plunged
                  into the silver store, dashed up to the counter, and seized the merchant by the
                  hand. Then with an air of triumph, and feeling greater than the President of the
                  United States, who gets his rent free, I slammed the four dollars on the counter
                  and asked the dealer in silver what he<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5851-00000051"/>
                  thought of them. Hie took them up, examined them closely, cast a suspicious glance
                  at me, and said one word—"Bogus!"</p>
               <p>I fell senseless and dollarless to the floor. I recovered and fell again, and
                  again, and again. At last I was carried home on a shutter, and when I arrived
                  there I found that my house had been plundered. Electro-magnetic battery, Romulus
                  and Remus, ice cream and coffee, everything was gone.</p>
               <p>It was all a conspiracy; I know it. My friends betrayed me. Greeny was sharper
                  than I was, and I am victimized. All I can do is to submit calmly to my fate.
                  "Honesty is the best policy," I am told, but I think a policy from a life
                  insurance company is the best thing a man can possess in these critical times. I
                  shall retrench, cut down expenses, and endeavor to survive my present
                  embarrassments. If fortune smiles upon me, the world may hear from me again.</p>

               <head>THE DRAMATIC ELEPHANT.</head>
               <p>The illustrious champion of Fat Comedy is playing another farewell engagement at
                  the theatre. As this is positively his last appearance till next winter, there is
                  an inordinate desire on the part of the public to see him. I witnessed his
                  Falstaff a few nights ago, and rather liked it.</p>
               <p>As there are few people in this age of the world who have heard of Falstaff, or
                  know anything of his antecedents, I propose to give a brief sketch of his life and
                  public services. He was born (as I am reliably informed) of rich but respectable
                  parents, some time previous to their decease. At a very early age he evinced an
                  aptitude for falsifying, and at the age of two years was actually guilty of lying
                  in his mother's lap. He was a very bright boy, too, and at the age of nine months
                  was sharp enough to cut his own teeth. His parents had designed him for their
                  staff of life, on which to lean in their declining years, but, owing to his
                  propensity for lying, they subsequently called him their False-staff. Hence the
                  name he bears even to this day. His great size and fatness, when he reached the
                  age of maturity, have been considered remarkable, but at the time of his birth his
                  parents were much larger than he. These<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5851-00000052"/>
                  interesting facts are possessed by but few historians, and were not even known to
                  Mr. Shakspeare, the London stage-driver.</p>
               <p>Falstaff, in the middle and toward the latter end of his life, was a very bad
                  character indeed, hopelessly given to lying and boasting—but Shakspeare and modern
                  actors have made a good character of him, in spite of himself. In extreme old age
                  his corporeal dimensions were immense—absolutely fearful. It was a voyage, not
                  without peril, to go around him. About this time he entered the service of Prince
                  Hal, a royal robber, and distinguished himself in a hand-to-hand combat with two,
                  three, or eleven men, in a place called Buckram.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hackett, the modern representative of Sir John, (who, be it known, was not
                  related to Sir Loin, of Steak, nor any of that family) enlarges upon the original,
                  and absorbs enough cotton in his composition to give the Manchester operatives
                  employment for a month. When he wants a new dress for his character, he hires a
                  surveyor to take his measure, and then advertises for contractors to have the suit
                  made. He gets a new dress every seven years and immediately thereafter a panic
                  ensues in the dry goods market.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hackett <emph>looks</emph> the character, however, to the life. He is in
                  stature (when properly made up,) about five feet nine inches high, and about nine
                  fee five inches broad. His appearance is very much that of a large-sized beer
                  barrel, and he looks as though he had been set up sidewise and had a heal fired
                  between his shoulders out of a howitzer. His walk is (so to speak) the very
                  embodiment of grace and elegance, and reminds you strikingly of a hippopotamus
                  with a sore heel. His manner and gestures are peculiarly graceful, and must be
                  seen to be appreciated.</p>
               <p>I visited the theatre as an observer—as a critic—to observe and criticise,
                  indiscriminately, actors and audience. While I was sitting in the dress
                  semi-circle, watching the progress of the play, I noticed young men getting up
                  between the acts and telling young ladies who were with them that they were going
                  out to get opera glasses. It occurred to me that it would be grand to look at
                  Falstaff through a telescope and see if he was inhabited, and all that sort of
                  thing; but it seemed a little singular that men should want to see him through a
                  simple opera glass. To be in fashion, however, I concluded to come down stairs and
                  get an opera glass myself. Down I came. Followed the crowd, because I knew the
                  crowd knew where the opera glasses were. We (that is, myself and the crowd,)
                  passed through a long, dark alley-way, and came to a sign with a house on it that
                  read, "The Falstaff." Strange thoughts entered my head at once, and I began to
                  think there was a new style of opera glass gotten up expressly for Falstaff. To
                  avoid ludicrous blunders, I waited to see someby use one before I purchased. I
                  noticed that young men apparently accustomed to the new-fashioned instrument, put
                  it to their lips, instead of their eyes. I was learning rapidly. I tried one, and
                  liked it—liked it so well, I took a dozen opera glasses. I also took a few opera
                  glasses with sugar in them, and then went back into the theatre. After that,<pb
                     n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5851-00000053"/> when I observed a young man with an
                  incipient moustache and painted cheeks, colored eyebrows and shiny locks, telling
                  a sweet creature in crinoline that he was going to get an opera glass, I
                  sympathized with him, and wanted to wink at him, but I didn't.</p>
               <p>I scraped up an acquaintance (that's a Milwaukee phrase) with a delicate, tender
                  looking female, whose drooping eyelids and care-worn features, overcast with a
                  melancholy pallor, gave evidence of deep-seated sorrow. She looked as though her
                  companion had gone for an opera glass. I could imagine her in love with some
                  heartless swain, who, by inconstancy, or being addicted to the opera glass, had
                  blasted her hopes and made her miserable. I addressed her—not harshly, not
                  abruptly, but calmly and tenderly—trying to soften down the tone of my voice to
                  the fine melody of her sympathetic feeling. "Madam," said I, "you seem sorrowful;
                  don't you like the play?"</p>
               <p>"Not much," she replied; "You know it's mity hard arter one's been doin' a hard
                  day's washin' to keer much for play actin'."</p>
               <p>I went for another opera glass so quick it made my head swim. When I returned I
                  took a seat among a bevy of ladies, whose dresses were not suggestive of hard
                  day's washings, and made up my mind I would see the play out if it was ever going
                  to play out. I recognized an old friend of the fair sex, and asked her how the
                  game stood.</p>
               <p>"Falstaff has just been wounded," said she.</p>
               <p>"Has he?" said I; "why don't he get a surgeon to dress his wounds?"</p>
               <p>"Because," she replied, trying to be witty, "he is a Sir John himself, and big
                  enough to dress his own wounds." And then she went on in that style of talk till I
                  had to hold my head. I was astonished by the appearance of a second Falstaff on
                  the stage, by and by a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, and so on till the stage
                  was literally covered with Falstaves (how's that for a plural, eh?) I discovered
                  for the first time that the Falstaff opera glass magnified numbers as well as
                  size, which convinced me more than ever of its superiority over all others. Fat
                  Stars on the stage increased at an alarming rate, and I began to think of claiming
                  the discovery of a new constellation. I started out for another opera glass to
                  prosecute my astronomical observations, and felt big enough to play Falstaff
                  myself. Told the man with the opera glasses, round by the post-office, that I
                     <emph>was</emph> Falstaff, and regaled him with a long story about the men in
                  buckram. I called for an opera glass, and told him the lime had sack in it, and
                  then threw it in his face just to see if I could do it like Falstaff. Thereupon a
                  difficulty arose between us—which difficulty was the door of the building, with me
                  on the outside, suffering from sea-sickness over the left eye The visible part of
                  creation seemed inclined to whirl considerably. I stood on the sidewalk a spell,
                  waiting for the theatre to come round. Theatre failed to connect; did not come
                  round as anticipated, and I started home. Owing to the glare of gas-light, and the
                  effect of opera glasses, I felt a dizziness in the head, and several times, to my
                  infinite astonishment, found both my legs on one side of the street, and the
                  sidewalk trying to leap over my head. I reached home without much<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000054"/> damage to the street, and after reading from a work
                  concerning optical instruments, a chapter on opera glasses, I retired.</p>
               <p>In conclusion. Many persons have supposed me to be the individual who plays
                  Falstaff at Ben's, and for this reason, solely, Mr. Hackett has drawn very large
                  and intelligent audiences. However painful it may be to me to injure the gentleman
                  pecuniarily, I feel duty-bound to disabuse the minds of the people, I never
                  appeared as Falstaff, and don't intend to. Nor can I see how the mistake should
                  occur. Mr. Hackett is a fat man; I am a lean man, albeit more like a staff than he
                  is. He is the Falstaff; I am the true staff. That's the difference.</p>

               <head>AN AFFAIR OF THE HEART.</head>
               <p>Some people fall in love—I was pulled into it. Anonymous letters without any names
                  to them, and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cartes de visite</foreign> (as much like the
                  original as a duck pond is like a skating park) accomplished my destruction,
                  morally, physically, and otherwisely.</p>
               <p>The feeling is first-rate till it begins to strike in. I am willing to admit that
                  the first sensation is good, but the reaction is fearful—especially when you
                  become convinced that anonymous letters and photographs have told you an
                  abominable lie. I felt gorgeous when I was first pulled (I emphatically deny that
                  I <emph>fell</emph> into love. I felt as though I was in the basement of a sugar
                  refinery, with a shower of the sweet article pouring upon me; I felt as if I had
                  been tied to a water-wheel that was making three hundred revolutions a minute, and
                  had traveled with it a whole day; I felt—I—I—I felt.</p>
               <p>If I speak feelingly on this subject, I am willing to be forgiven. Anonymous
                  letters, bad pictures and matrimonial advertisements are omnipotent. I read in a
                  four line notice of a young lady that wanted to correspond with a single
                  gentleman, (of course she didn't want to correspond with more than one at a time
                  while stationary continues so enormously high,) "with a view to fun or matrimony."
                  She "was considered good-looking, and had money to back her." I don't like
                  tobacco, but the "good-looking" was an inducement. I addressed the advertiseatrix
                  a note, (not promissory,) and she replied—anonymously. I sent her another; she
                  replied, and signed her letter with a star. I inferred that she was an astronomer,
                  an actress, or the daughter of a policeman. I was frantic—I could neither eat,
                  sleep nor—yes, I could drink a little. I had all the symptoms of an attack of the
                  tender passion—the toughest passion that ever got hold of me, except hydrophobia,
                  and I did begin to have an aversion to water at one time.</p>
               <p>I watched the post-office, knowing the number of her box, incessantly. I saw a man
                  take a letter from the box nearest hers, and supposing that he lived next door to
                  her, I determined to follow him home, and find her dwelling in that way. I
                  followed him three miles, over rugged streets and slippery side-walks, and found
                  that the next door to his residence was a vacant lot, and to add to my aggravation
                  there was a notice on the fence, "to lease for nineteen years to responsible
                  parties." I was subdued but not conquered.</p>
               <p>The next letter I received from my inamorata contained her photograph. Oh! it was
                  beautiful. She was a Venus de Medici—Medical Venus. Swan-like neck, (and a swan is
                  not a goose I would have you understand,) raven ringlets, and other parts of her
                  composition resembling various other birds. I believe she was not web-footed, and
                  partook of none of<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5851-00000058"/> the qualities of
                  aquatic fowls—except the swan. I wrote an answer, and entreated her to tell me
                  where she lived. She wouldn't do it; but promised to display a white handkerchief
                  in the theatre at a certain hour of a certain evening, during a certain act of a
                  certain play, and I must be certain to do the same thing. That was glorious—mutual
                  recognition, you know—meet her at the door—romance in real life—everything. I
                  carried a white handkerchief in my hand three days, and tied it around my wrist at
                  night for fear I should forget the appointment. At length the evening and the
                  hour, and the play and the act and the scene arrived. I plunged into the theatre,
                  and may I be hanged if every man, woman and child, including the actors and
                  actresses, didn't have a white handkerchief displayed conspicuously.</p>
               <p>For about the space of a flash of lightning I was furious, and I suppose the
                  gentlemen in the lobby thought I was rehearsing the "Maniac," for their attention
                  was diverted from the play and centered on me. It occurred to me suddenly that I
                  might devise a method by which I could find out the locality of my Venus anyhow.
                  In the exuberance of my feelings I rushed down to the box office, and asked the
                  treasurer if he had any reserved seats for white handkerchiefs; then I asked him
                  if he had sold a seat with a white handkerchief in it, or sold a white
                  handkerchief to a seat; if he had any white handkerchiefs left, and if he had
                  reserved handkerchiefs for two? I discovered that I had it all wrong, but before I
                  had time to explain myself, I heard a faint voice on the inside, ejaculating "kick
                  that man out." I deemed an apology at that time unnecessary, and left
                  hurriedly.</p>
               <p>For several days I was a candidate for a charitable institution, where they doctor
                  diseased intellects, but fortunately was not elected. My usual presence of mind,
                  for which I am noted, forsook me entirely.</p>
               <p>On one occasion at table I commenced carving my napkin, and wiped my face with a
                  sirloin steak, and on another occasion, in an unpardonable fit of abstractedness,
                  I paid a bill when it was presented to me.</p>
               <p>A few days ago I got another letter—the last of the series. At the bottom of the
                  delicate epistle was a polite invitation to the recipient to "call 'round;" call
                  at "4 P. M., punctually," and he would see the writer. "4 P. M., punctuallies"
                  won't win; they are not my style. My rules of etiquette are not governed by a
                  timepiece, nor an almanac, and I concluded to go when I got ready, which was after
                  nightfall. I had another fine journey in prospect over slippery sidewalks. I am
                  down on sidewalks—have been a dozen times during the past winter, but,
                  fortunately, without any serious result to the sidewalks.</p>
               <p>I "called 'round." I pulled the bell-wire—a necessary proceeding if one wants to
                  gain admission to a modern dwelling—and I saw my anonymous correspondent. I think
                  she was of a literary turn of mind, for I found her reclining in a luxuriously
                  indolent attitude on a cheap sofa, and reading a show-bill. She was not <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">en deshabille</foreign>, if I understand the meaning of that
                  French phrase, which is questionable; but the condition of her dress was
                  suggestive of a<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5851-00000059"/> drought and an
                  unparalleled scarcity of soap. I must (it is a duty I owe society) denounce
                  photograph artists. They are swindlers, humbugs, and have no more conscience than
                  a Bengal tiger. No photograph man ever brought out the freckles on a woman's face
                  correctly; no photograph ever did justice to red hair, or a pair of eyes that
                  looked as if they were set in the middle of the week, and were looking both ways
                  for Sunday. No, sir. Why, that woman looked no more like her photograph than a
                  potatoe patch looks like an apple orchard. Her hair (which had a pound and a half,
                  at least, of highly perfumed ointment on it, and was the only decorated part of
                  her person,) looked like a picture of a conflagration on an insurance card, and
                  her nose was so big she couldn't blow but one side of it at a time. I was ready to
                  cut her acquaintance as soon as I saw her, but she manifested an inclination to
                  retain me; she was too proud of me entirely. Pretty soon the family began to come
                  in, one by one, principally little shavers, and she insisted on introducing me to
                  every one of them. They seemed to share her passion for hair oil; every one of
                  them had an immense quantity of the article on his or her head. I think the whole
                  family had hair oil on the brain. One little fellow evinced unwarrantable
                  familiarity, and wanted to climb up into my lap, and thrust his head, grease and
                  all, in my face. I remember distinctly that I pushed him from under my nasal organ
                  with the emphatic remark that little boys should be seen, not smelt.</p>
               <p>I arose to depart, and the young lady seemed to regret it. I was glad of it. It's
                  astonishing how friendly and affectionate homely people will be. I never could be
                  friendly with anybody. It was raining when I left, and I ventured to ask her for
                  an umbrella. She said she had but one, which was a bran new one, and she didn't
                  want to get it wet.</p>
               <p>I was glad enough to got away, however, even though I had to tramp through the
                  rain. Ever since that time I have studiously avoided her residence; but she seeks
                  me out. She inflicts her presence upon me at balls and parties, and shows, and
                  street corners. Before I saw her I received a letter from her every two days.
                  After I saw her I received two every day. But I think I am effectually rid of her
                  at last.</p>
               <p>Passing along a sidewalk one day, with a male friend of mine, I met her. A happy
                  thought struck me. I pretended not to see her, and as we passed her I said to my
                  friend, loud enough for her to hear, "shortly after I buried my tenth wife"—and
                  then I let my voice die away into nothing. I think I made the number large enough,
                  and I have every reason to believe she heard it. Two hours afterward, I was
                  approached by a man with a freckled face, cross-eyes, prominent nasal
                  protuberance, and incendiary hair. I could have sworn he was the brother of the
                  anonymous woman if I had met him in Norway. He was a powerful man. Coming up to me
                  quietly, he said, "Shortly after I buried my tenth wife," and then he planted his
                  fist between my eyes.</p>
               <p>I trust an indulgent public will excuse me if I do not describe anything that
                  occurred during the next<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5851-00000060"/> twenty-four
                  hours. My recollection of that period is very imperfect, indeed. The first man I
                  remember to have seen was a physician, who expressed intense satisfaction at
                  finding me "better." Any young lady who is passionately fond of "black eyes" will
                  find a very desirable acquaintance in me. She must not address me anonymously
                  though. I am conscientiously opposed to anonymous letters, photographs, red hair,
                  and big brothers. If any outrageous female ever sends me another photograph, I'll
                  have it hung up in the rogue's gallery—if I don't, I'm a sinner.</p>

               <head>FUN A-SLEIGHING.</head>
               <p>I was seized with a popular mania the other day, and, while crazy with excitement,
                  rushed into a livery stable and asked the proprietor what he would charge me for a
                  horse and cutter for half a day. Proprietor said four dollars. I shuddered, and
                  asked him if he wanted the money in silver. He shuddered, and said no. Then I
                  complained of the price, and told him I thought he was charging too much. He
                  thought not; said he had been charging three dollars, but had raised a dollar when
                  the snow commenced thawing. I asked him why the charging of that extra dollar was
                  like Abraham Lincoln, and he confessed he didn't know. I closed one eye, winked
                  with the other, and said, because it was a bad precedent. Then he said that was
                  darned good, and I might have a horse and cutter all day for nothing if I would
                  not tell another like it. On this hint, I spoke, as Othello says, and made a
                  bargain at once.</p>
               <p>My idea was to drive all over the city alone; to be the observed of all observers,
                  the admired of all admirers, and so on, and when the sombre shades of nightfall
                  began to wrap themselves about the earth, and red hair could not easily be
                  detected, I would<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5851-00000061"/> call on certain young
                  lady of my acquaintance and take her to drive. With my cup of bliss running over
                  in my imagination, I mounted the vehicle and started.</p>
               <p>To the avenue first I went, of course, and in ten minutes found that my vehicle
                  was only one among one thousand, embracing everything from a four-horse,
                  brass-mounted, painted and spangled chariot, down to a child's sled drawn by a
                  Newfoundland dog. There were all sorts of horses—bay horses, sorrel horses, dun
                  horses; (every time I saw a dun coming I turned around and went the other way
                  instinctively,) and there were piebalds, and iron-greys, and black horses, and
                  white horses; horses paid for, horses unpaid for, and horses that never would be
                  paid for. There were fat horses and lean horses; 2:40 horses, and horses that
                  could travel a mile in two hours and forty minutes. There were all sorts of
                  people; poor people, rich people and middlings; men with an income of ten thousand
                  a year, riding in ten dollar sleds; and men who never had ten dollars at one time
                  in their lives, riding in palaces mounted on runners. There were young men and old
                  men, young ladies and old ladies; married persons riding by themselves, and single
                  persons riding in pairs. Young ladies were laughing, young men were singing and
                  shouting, old men were grinning, and old ladies were grumbling. There were
                  Benedicks, out with their better halves to be scolded without anybody hearing; and
                  there were merry bachelors, out with frail creatures in crinoline merely to enjoy
                  the luxury of being scolded. There were sleighs running in all directions tions;
                  sleighs in all positions and conditions; sleighs flying over the earth like
                  locomotives on a railroad track, and sleighs standing stark still. There were
                  people getting out of sleighs, and people getting in sleighs; and sometimes they
                  got excited and made mistakes, I think, for I met somebody with somebody else's
                  wife, and somebody else with somebody's wife. There were persons who went out for
                  exercise, and came back terribly exercised; persons who went out to enjoy the cold
                  air, and got in hot water. There were unexpected and pleasant meetings, and
                  meetings expected and unpleasant; everything—everybody. Societies of all grades,
                  and all grades of society were represented, and even the avenue had its grades.
                  Pedestrians were few; every man on foot who expected to cross the avenue, carried
                  a slate and pencil with him, and paused to calculate the distance, the number and
                  comparative speed of vehicles, and the worth of his neck, before he ventured.</p>
               <p>As I struck the selvedge of the sleighing multitude, I heard a mysterious voice
                  say, "Go in and mingle." I went in and mingled. As I turned the first corner I
                  collided broadside with seventeen females and an Ethiopian charioteer, who were
                  enjoying a grandiloquent burst of excessive hilarity in a sort of sledge that
                  looked like the remnant of a last war's pontoon bridge. My horse went over the
                  sledge, my cutter went through it, and I came down, head foremost, on top of it.
                  There was a collapse of crinoline, a few respectable screams, a half-hour of
                  valuable sleighing time lost in repairing my turnout, and after that I went on my
                  way as joyous as ever.</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5851-00000062"/>
               <p>Met a hilarious young man driving alone, evidently delighted with his own society,
                  and singing some verses of a popular song. I forget the words, but I think one
                  line intimated that John Brown was a moulder, and continues his occupation "in the
                  ground." One gay and festive chap said, singingly, "We met, 'twas in a crowd," and
                  before he had finished the refrain he ran headlong into an ice wagon.</p>
               <p>Collisions were becoming so frequent that I was induced to change my mind in
                  relation to a little affair which I mentioned in the beginning of this letter,
                  to-wit, namely: I concluded to go for my lady-love at once, and not wait for
                  nightfall to conceal her sanguinary hair. I concluded to take her and retire to
                  the classic shades of somewhere out of town, where the sleighs were not thicker
                  than mosquitos usually are in midsummer.</p>
               <p>To have a little innocent sport, however, and make her feel bad, I concluded to
                  drive by her house once or twice before stopping, and make her think I was not
                  going to call. Expected she would run to the door and look after me. I drove past
                  a couple of times and saw nothing of her. Tried it twice more with the same
                  result. Drove by about two hundred times, and not a glimpse could I get of her.
                  Concluded she was "playing it fine," and I would be revenged. I would run into a
                  snow-bank and upset myself in front of her door, and make believe I was killed.
                  Then she would feel sorry, and shed tears of pity and remorse, and all that sort
                  of stuff. I ran into the snow-bank as I had promised myself to do—the sleigh was
                  upset beautifully—I tumbled out as well as anybody could have done it—and for
                  about the space of two minutes I looked magnificently dead. At the end of the two
                  minutes, the only demonstration that had been made was on the part of a jolly
                  Dutchman who lived near by. He came rushing out of his house, took a good look at
                  me, and then called on his wife Shane, to "throw hot water on dem tam trunkard
                  that is blocking up der sidevalk." His apostrophe to "Shane" brought me to my feet
                  in double quick time, and put me in a rage. I ran to my lady's house frantically,
                  rung the bell, pounded the door with my fist, and kicked it furiously with both
                  feet. She came quickly, before my eyes quit flashing fire. You ought to see my
                  eyes flash fire once. They can do it if anybody's can. She looked frightened. I
                  told her if she wanted to drive with me, she had better jerk on her good clothes
                  in less than no time. She harnessed herself in about five minutes, which is a
                  shorter period than ever the same feat was accomplished in by any other living
                  woman. We ensconced ourselves in the cutter and hurried away, though I had not the
                  least idea of where I was going. I drove sometimes on one side of the street,
                  sometimes on the other, and sometimes in the middle. I was frantic. The fair,
                  frail creature, with the ferocious hair, wanted to know if I was crazy. We went
                  along leisurely for a while, and talked promiscuously. My companion was a genuine
                  quodlibetarian, (I beg your pardon; that word <emph>is</emph> in the dictionary,)
                  and was infinitely fond of conversing on subjects that had nothing in them.</p>
               <p>As soon as we reached the outskirts of the city,<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000063"/> where there was nobody to witness my misfortunes,
                  if any should occur, I commenced putting on airs. drove my team over snowbanks,
                  rail fences and cattle, and even small houses were in danger. When I had got
                  enough of the rural districts, I undertook to return to the city quietly, but the
                  horse was of a different turn of mind altogether. He smelt oats in the dim
                  distance, and wanted to come back like a streak of chain lightning. He traveled
                  like a shot out of a columbiad. In a few minutes we were on the avenue again,
                  mingling with men, women, children, sleighs and horses, and the sounds of the
                  hilarious shouts of the multitude, and the tintinabulation of the bells (and
                  beaux) were deafening. My horse went faster and faster. I could no more hold him
                  than I could hold an office. The air was filled with particles of snow, and the
                  particles of snow, with little regard for the rules of propriety, were continually
                  getting into ladies' eyes, which caused them to wink incessantly. I was silly
                  enough, with my limited knowledge of human nature and the art of sleighing, to
                  suppose they were all winking at me, and I undertook to reciprocate. The
                  consequence was, that I was winking all the time, and forgot to devote even one
                  eye to the interests of my horse. He became indignant, and rushed down an
                  embankment, and before I had time to protest against his outrageous conduct, the
                  fair, frail creature and myself were tumbled headlong into a snow-bank. I was
                  fortunate—I fell where the snow was shallow, but the frail, fair creature was more
                  ambitious. She fell where the snow was six feet deep, and I think she went to the
                  bottom. There was nothing to denote the course she had taken but a yawning cavern
                  in the vast snow-drift. I recovered myself and looked after her, but could not see
                  her. Pretty soon a little volume of steam commenced issuing from the aforesaid
                  yawning cavern in the snow-drift, and I became convinced that her incendiary hair
                  was melting the snow. I shouted for help, for it occurred to me that she was in
                  danger of drowning. But there was no help for me; nobody could hear me for the
                  sound of the bells. As a last resort I went for at rail, thrust one end of it in
                  the snow-heap and mounted the other. Up came the unfortunate girl, and down I
                  went—to the bottom. She was not so generous as I had been. She never paused to
                  help me out of my difficulty, but fled precipitately. And to add to my misery, she
                  has told all of my acquaintances that I can't drive a horse; that I don't know
                  anything about sleighing; that I can't keep a hotel; that, in short, I don't
                  amount to a pinch of snuff.</p>
               <p>I was saved from an untimely freeze-to-death by a humane ice-gatherer, who had
                  witnessed my calamity, and seeing there was no other help for me, fished me out
                  with an ice-hook. I have settled an annuity upon him, which is sufficiently large
                  to permit him to retire from ice-gathering, and live in luxurious ease.</p>
               <p>I returned the horse and cutter to their proprietor, in good order. On the next
                  day I addressed a note to "the fair, frail creature," demanding an explanation of
                  her scandalous conduct. She replied, merely congratulating me on my escape from
                  suffocation in<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5851-00000064"/> a snow-drift. Think of
                  it! Me! The subscriber! I, who have passed through more trials and tribulations
                  than any other male individual in existence, except my friend, W. Phillips, and a
                  few thousand others! I, who have been the unflinching advocate of the cause of the
                  weaker sex all the days of my life; have stood up for their rights when I would
                  have felt better sitting down! Me! to be snubbed by a red-headed woman! It's
                  awful.</p>

               <head>THE SHOW BUSINESS.</head>
               <p>I move with the masses. In this respect I differ from those persons who never move
                  except when rents go up; and from a certain member of the common council who never
                  moved but once in his life, and then he moved to adjourn. He was engaged three
                  weeks afterwards writing letters to his eastern friends, informing them of what he
                  had accomplished.</p>
               <p>I move with the masses. I insist upon it. I followed a mass of three people a
                  short distance up Randolph street four evenings ago, and they led me into a
                  difficulty, the details of which, if written in a good ripe melodramatic style,
                  and a clear, round hand, would cause a man's blood to stand on end.</p>
               <p>This mighty, moving, surging, swaying concourse of three people, all of whom were
                  of the opposite sex except two, paused in front of a photograph artist's picture
                  gallery. That is, I supposed it to be a photograph artist's picture gallery,
                  because there was a great number of photographs hanging by the side of the
                  door—the inevitable sign, you know. I examined the pictures, and found they were
                  all niggers, whereupon I concluded that the picture gallery was owned by an
                  Ethiopian, or, to be polite about the matter, a gentleman of the opposite
                  color.</p>
               <p>The crowd went up stairs. I know they were not going to have their pictures taken
                  at that time of night, so I followed them, in the hope of seeing something. I saw
                  it. I recognized the sign-board of a minstrel company designated by four long
                  names not possessed by any other company now in the United States. I resolved to
                  see the old favorites, whose names are as familiar to persons capable of
                  pronouncing them as household words. I applied at the box office for a
                  complimentary ticket, but the ticket agent couldn't see it, owing to the small
                  size of the hole through which he delivers tickets. I told him it was all right,
                  (the argument invariably resorted to by men in a dilemma,) but there was still a
                  defect in his optical eye-sight. It was vain that I told him he need have no
                  fears, there would be nobody in the hall that would know me, &amp;c. It was vain
                  that I told him I had access to the columns of a newspaper, and would give him
                  fits some Sunday if he didn't mind his business. It was vain. Everything was vain,
                  and I was disgusted.</p>
               <p>I demanded an audience with Mr. Arlington, the left-end man. Ticket agent said Mr.
                  Arlington had an audience already; a very respectable one, too. I discovered an
                  insinuation in his remark, but I treated it contemptuously.</p>
               <p>I came down stairs peaceably, and made up my mind that I would go into the
                  dressing-room and demand an explanation of somebody. I met a young American, about
                  nine years old, who, I imagined from his important appearance, could feel an
                  American moustache sprouting behind his teeth. I treated him with all the respect
                  due to a Young American,<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5851-00000068"/> and requested
                  him to tell me where the back entrance to the minstrel hall was situated. The
                  miserable little cuss asked me if he looked like a city directory, and that was
                  all the information I could get from him.</p>
               <p>I immediately set out to rise by my own exertions, marched around a corner, and
                  brought up in an alley, where I was assailed by a diabolical dog of the canine
                  race, with a leather collar around his throat, full of tacks. The owner of the dog
                  is a coward, and I know it. He put those tacks on his dog so that other dogs, if
                  they attacked him, would get the worst of the fight; and that same man, if his dog
                  should attack a dog with tacks on his throat, would be mean enough to complain of
                  the tax on dogs.</p>
               <p>I found the back entrance and thundered at the door with my boot heels, while the
                  dog enlivened the affair with a soul-stirring howl. There is a vast quantity of
                  thunder in my boot heels, and it was not long till the door of the back entrance
                  flew open to admit me. The opener looked like an American negro, and I passed him
                  coldly and went up stairs. He followed me, and when I got a good light on him I
                  discovered that he was Arlington, frescoed with burnt cork.</p>
               <p>Do you know Arlington? He is a man of peculiar architecture, and you will know him
                  at first sight if you are acquainted with him. He is dark complected and lantern
                  jawed, (dark-lantern jawed,) and looks like an eel. There's a good'eel of fun in
                  him. There are some comedians so funny that an audience begins to laugh the moment
                  they come on the stage. Arlington's audience begins to laugh before he comes into
                  the hall, and they don't stop until he goes home and goes to bed. He never says
                  anything funny after he goes to bed, and so they stop laughing.</p>
               <p>I was ushered into the dressing room, and one of the inmates gave me a champagne
                  basket to sit on, without much ceremony. They were all coloring, and I learned the
                  whole process. I believe I could do it now. Bones was turning a wheel with one
                  hand and coloring with the other. I asked him what he was turning the wheel for,
                  and he gave me the reason. He said it was full of jokes written on paper, and
                  perpetrated by the company during the week. He turned the wheel, and he and
                  Arlington took the jokes alternately as they came out. I told him I thought the
                  wheel would soon be cut to pieces, there were so many old saws in it. He looked
                  undecided, and said nothing.</p>
               <p>There was a big furnace in the room, full of corks, burning. Corks don't cost the
                  company a cent. They have more empty bottles than corks. They have corks enough
                  for themselves, and corks to sell. I was about to explain the cause of my visit,
                  and how I had been treated by the ticket-seller, when Jones, who is a member of
                  the old family of Joneses, complimented me by saying that he wanted to engage me
                  for an end man. I felt immensely tickled, though I had no notion of accepting the
                  situation. Pshaw! do you think I would ever be foolish enough to black my face?
                  For my own satisfaction, however, I asked him which end he wanted to engage me
                  for, and he said the last end—to put the lights out and take up the carpet after
                  the audience had gone home. I was mute with astonishment.</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5851-00000069"/>
               <p>Kelly, the centre man, is a fiery dragon; that's what he is, and the color of his
                  moustache proves it. I inquired of him if they had a light house, which is the
                  popular phrase for small audience, and he said there was a light house on the lake
                  shore, which I could go and see whenever I felt like it. And when I asked him how
                  soon the show would be out, he said he would show me out whenever I was ready to
                  go.</p>
               <p>I inquired of Arlington if the centre man meant anything, and he said na-o-o-o.
                  Anybody that has heard him draw out his peculiar "noes" knows how long they are.
                  His noes are longer than any man's I know of.</p>
               <p>When the bell rung the curtain up, I amused myself by strolling through the
                  dressing-room, taking an inventory of things worthy of note. I was all alone,
                  solitary in my glory, with no one to recount my liabilities to, no means of
                  whiling away the time agreeably, and—no one to love. I am very unhappy when I am
                  miserable. I sometimes think I am more unfortunate than a man that never was born.
                  I have a contempt for little things, and big things have a contempt for me. There
                  I was, as I have said before, all alone, and in a condition to negotiate a loan,
                  but hadn't the ghost of chances just as I arrived at a conclusion, and was about
                  to stop a while, I saw a light shining through a door that opened somewhere, and I
                  resolved to go there. I started off to the solemn and slow time of Thomas
                  Clutterbuck, who was then being sung to death on the stage, and pushed the door
                  open gently. And what a spectacle met my confounded gaze! I turned a back
                  handspring without touching the floor, and shrieked for mercy, camphor, fresh air,
                  and Roman punches. Oh! it was awful. I saw a black African girl making her toilet.
                  I never shall forget the shudder that shot through my frame like a piece of cold
                  watermelon. I fell down and turned over, and got up again. Then I got up again,
                  and fell over and turned down again. I was shocked. I felt cold drops of modesty
                  trickling from my temples. One of the colored individuals heard me collapse, and
                  came off the stage to see what ailed me. He stood over me in a speechless
                  attitude, his fine eyes in a big frenzy rolling, or something of that sort, and
                  demanded what was the matter. I told him all about it. It was Kelly, and he said I
                  was a fool; the woman was a man, and all that sort of stuff, but I paid no
                  attention to it. I kicked, and jumped up and started to run, and I went
                  head-foremost through a bass drum. The alarm created a stampede, and brought the
                  black corps behind the scenes in a general stage-rout.</p>
               <p>One of them seized me by the coat-tails, and I seized him by the wig. The wig came
                  off, and so did the coat-tails, and our sudden separation was so precipitate, that
                  I struck my face against the big string of a bass viol, and hurt the string like
                  the deuce. There was but one thing left for me to do, and that was to put myself
                  out before somebody else did it. I found the stairway, and reached the bottom at a
                  single leap, hotly pursued by the bass drum, a pitcher of water, and a bucket of
                  burnt cork in a melting mood. I don't know what became of<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000070"/> the pitcher of water, but the course of the bass
                  drum was arrested by a vigilant policeman, who was too busy to pay any attention
                  to me.</p>
               <p>Thus terminated a simple adventure, in search of something. I ask of all pious and
                  scientific people, if I have not been maltreated? But I'll be happy yet.

                  never will get another complimentary ticket from me.</p>

               <head>A SPECK OF WAR.</head>
               <p>Militia companies were always popular, but never so much as when the war broke
                  out. Young men with stay-at-home-and-take-care-of-the-women proclivities were more
                  than ever inclined to join the Home Guards, in consequence of increased mortality
                  in the army of the United States, as shown by the newspaper statistics.</p>
               <p>With a laudable ambition to support the government in any and every emergency, I
                  became a member of the war department myself. I joined the Ellsworth Zouaves, a
                  remnant of what used to be a troupe of acrobats, who distinguished themselves all
                  the way from Chicago to Washington, by turning double somersaults, with muskets in
                  their mouths and bayonets in their hands.</p>
               <p>There are no members of the old Zouave battalion in the new one, but the new one
                  retains the name of Ellsworth because one of the members has a brother that once
                  saw a picture of Col. Ellsworth's grand-father. The names of organizations
                  frequently have a more remote origin than this, and many of them are about as
                  consistent and reasonable as a man claiming relationship to the President of the
                  United States because he was born in Johnsonville;<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000071"/> or supposing he would be governor if he married a
                  governess; or trying to pass free at a circus as a representative of the press
                  because he is a cheese-maker.</p>
               <p>I was put through a rigid course of examination before I could be made a Zouave,
                  and I say it with feelings of gratification and self-esteem, that I was remarkably
                  well posted in the catechism. My father was a hero of the revolution, having been
                  caught once in a water-wheel, and whirled around rapidly a number of times. Others
                  of the family have also distinguished themselves as military men at different
                  periods, but their deeds of courage are too well known to need repetition.</p>
               <p>The following is a copy verbatim et literatim et wordem of most of the questions
                  propounded to me, and the answers thereto, which my intimate acquaintance with the
                  army regulations and the report of the committee on the conduct of the war enabled
                  me to answer readily and accurately. My interrogator was a little man in federal
                  blue with gold leaves on his shoulders. They called him Major, but he looked young
                  enough to be a minor. He led off with:</p>
               <p>"How old are you, and what are your qualifications?"</p>
               <p>"Twenty-two and a strong stomach."</p>
               <p>Then I requested him to fire his interrogations singly, which he did.</p>
               <p>"What is the first duty to be learned by a soldier?"</p>
               <p>"How to draw his rations."</p>
               <p>"What is the most difficult feat for a soldier to perform?"</p>
               <p>"Drawing his bounty."</p>
               <p>"If you were in the rear rank of a company during an action, and the man in the
                  front rank before you should be wounded and disabled, what would you do?"</p>
               <p>"I would dispatch myself to the rear for a surgeon immediately. Some men would
                  step forward and take the wounded man's place, but that is unnatural."</p>
               <p>"If you were commanding skirmishers, and saw cavalry advancing in front and
                  infantry in the rear, which would you meet?"</p>
               <p>"Neither; I would mass myself for a bold movement, and shove out sideways."</p>
               <p>"If you were captured, what line of conduct would you observe?"</p>
               <p>"I would treat my captors with the utmost civility."</p>
               <p>"What are the duties of Home Guards?"</p>
               <p>"Their duty is to see that they have no duties."</p>
               <p>"What will you take?"</p>
               <p>The latter question may have been answered with too much vehemence, and may have
                  impressed listeners with the belief that I am in the habit of jumping at
                  conclusions. Such, however, is not the case.</p>
               <p>I am a Zouave; I am a Home Guard. I have been through all the manœuvres, and can
                  right about face; I can also write about any other part of the body. I can do the
                  hand-springs, and the tumbling, and the lay-down-and-roll-overs, which are done
                  with or without a musket. I have been drilled till the drill has become a bore. I
                  have drilled in all the marches, and leaps, and vaults, and in the bayonet
                     exercises,<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5851-00000072"/> and in all the steps—the
                  common step, the quick step, the very quick step, and the double-quick step, and
                  the trot and the run; also, in slow time and long time, which I never learned from
                  my landlady nor my tailor. I can shoulder arms, and bear arms, and carry arms (if
                  they are not too heavy), and reverse arms, and support arms (ordinarily my arms
                  support me), and I can order arms better than I can pay for them after they are
                  ordered. I can parry in tierce, and I can throw a hand-spring with a sword-bayonet
                  in my hand without breaking the sword-bayonet in more than three pieces, and I can
                  bite off a cartridge, without breaking my teeth out. Once, when an order was given
                  to sling knapsacks, I slung mine out of the window, and when the order was given
                  to unsling knapsacks, I went out and slung it back again quicker than anybody else
                  could have done it. I have got a pretty knapsack too—there are letters on it. It
                  is just the thing to sit down on in the time of an action, and is big enough for a
                  breastwork in cargo of danger from bullets or anything of that sort. It's heavy,
                  though, and I felt that there was an immense responsibility resting on me the
                  first time I shouldered it. I must have felt something like Atlas did the first
                  time he shouldered the world. It was so heavy that, as a piece of masterly
                  strategy, I fell back the first time I strapped it on; and, as a piece of
                  unmasterly strategy, I came near breaking my head against the floor. The Major has
                  promised to put sawdust, softened with soda water, on the floor hereafter.</p>
               <p>I have been getting a Major General's uniform made. There is every opportunity
                  that could be desired sired for promotion, in our corps, where real merit exists,
                  and a Major General of Home Guards is not to be sneezed at. I may have to keep my
                  uniform a few years before I will have occasion to wear it, but a Major General's
                  toggery is a good thing to have in case of promotion. I trust my friends will give
                  themselves no uneasiness, as I feel sure of ultimate success in the enterprise I
                  have undertaken. I mean to strike the key-note of my campaign soon, and their look
                  out for a sensation in military circles.</p>
               <p>I hav'nt shaved my upper lip since yesterday afternoon. To-morrow will be the
                  third day. I mean to grow a moustache that will be an object of admiration and
                  envy. Moustachios are indispensable to the achievement of a major generalship.
                  Moustachios are absolutely necessary to the achievement of anything that is
                  useful. I have laid mine out on the plan of the harpist's in Arleonniker's (that's
                  a kind of an abbreviation of Arlington, Kelly, Leon and Donniker's) opera troupe.
                  Mr. Spaulding nobly and generously volunteered to sit by as a pattern while my
                  barber took the measure of my face, and he also generously and nobly volunteered
                  to lend me the price of the shave.</p>
               <p>I am a Zouave, and I can almost feel that I am a Major General. I am constantly on
                  the alert to detect the faults in our home defences. Two of the first things I
                  shall do on assuming command of the Home Guards here, will be to erect a line of
                  fortifications on Michigan avenue and cover the city with a mosquito bar. Our
                  harbor defences are very poor, and will admit of many improvements. I shall also
                  build a fortress at Calumet, and erect a drug store at<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000073"/> the mouth of Chicago river. In the event of a war
                  between the United States and the Esquimaux, Chicago will, in all likelihood, be
                  one of the first cities attacked by the invading enemy, and every precaution
                  should be taken to be fully prepared for them. Should such attack ever be made by
                  the warlike and blood-thirsty Esquimaux, or any other of the great powers of the
                  earth, and should it be my misfortune to be unable personally to command my
                  forces, (for I have often observed that an invasion is productive of sickness) I
                  shall take care that my second officer is a man of sufficient capacity to defend
                  the city as ably as I would do it myself. Should the worst come to the worst, I
                  stand ready to sacrifice a substitute on the altar of my country.</p>

               <head>SKIRMISH WITH A "TIGER."</head>
               <p>The world is growing better. I know it. Men have forgotten their sordid
                  selfishness and mean passions, and are studying how they can best advance the
                  interests of their fellow-beings. The doctrine of total depravity is
                  defunct—virtue reigns triumphant.</p>
               <p>For example. I received a remittance the other day of fifty dollars from the
                  gentleman from whom I descended in a direct line, he being my father. Fifty
                  dollars is wholly inadequate to the purchase of an ordinary suit of clothes in
                  these times. What would purchase canvass enough for a circus tent three years ago
                  won't pay for a canvass-back duck now. To be brief, I felt as much lost with my
                  fifty dollars as I did without it.</p>
               <p>But a philanthropist came to the rescue. As neat and handsome a man as ever I saw,
                  (and I see myself daily,) saw me take the money from the post office, and
                  immediately volunteered to lend me any assistance that I might need. The money was
                  not heavy, and I found no difficulty in carrying it myself, for it was principally
                  paper.</p>
               <p>But ah, what a generous friend that young man proved. He could not be induced to
                  forsake me. He saw that I was in distress, because the sum of money was not as
                  large as I desired, and he proposed to reveal a plan, gratuitously, (bless him!)
                  whereby I could double it. I was enraptured with my new acquaintance. We strolled
                  together, arm in arm, and were very happy. We met half a dozen individuals
                  displaying all the fixtures and appurtenances belonging to perfect gentlemen,
                  including moustachios. My friend introduced me to all of them, with stunning
                  politeness. He had a peculiar habit of shutting one eye when he introduced me. I
                  think the operation had a sort of magic or mesmeric influence, for I observed that
                  the other gentlemen shut one eye too. The new acquaintances all joined my
                  particular friend and me in a general promenade. My "particular" whispered in my
                  ear that I had better take good care of my pocket-book; that a stranger never knew
                  who to trust, and all that. He said I was perfectly safe as long as he was with
                  me, but if I felt any uneasiness he would carry my money in his pockets. I
                  overwhelmed him with gratitude, and told him I did't want to annoy him so
                  much.</p>
               <p>Said he to his friends: "Let's take Hans Patrick to see the 'tiger.'"</p>
               <p>I thanked him kindly. Told him I had a free ticket to a menagerie which I never
                  used, and that I had no particular affection for the brute creation.</p>
               <p>"But we want you to fight the tiger," was the unanimous chime.</p>
               <p>I protested. Informed my friends that I was not an athlete, and never indulged in
                  any such sports.<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5851-00000077"/> With a good rifle I
                  could probably hold my own with a tiger if he came within my fire limits.</p>
               <p>My particular friend said they meant a faro bank. It was a gay institution, and I
                  could make a fortune in a few minutes. It occurred to me suddenly that a bank was
                  just the thing I needed, seeing I had considerable capital on hand. I consented to
                  go with them, and I saw their eyes sparkle. We went up stairs in a big brick
                  house, and stopped in room No. 6. One man stood behind a table which was covered
                  with green cloth. On the table were a deck of cards, a silver box, and a heap of
                  ivory checks. The green cloth, I was told, was intended to be a verification of
                  Tom Moore's line—"The innocent gambols on the green." I saw one man who <choice>
                     <sic>seeemed</sic>
                     <corr>seemed</corr>
                  </choice> to be taking up a collection. He had a saintly face, and declared
                  himself ready to "copper the bet." Thereupon he doubled a ten dollar note on the
                  ace and covered it with a copper cent. A man wearing the expression of a broken
                  down tragedian flopped four shillings on the tray and lost. He took it coolly
                  enough, got up and walked back and forth on the floor, looking like a picture of
                  Napoleon at Helena, (Ark.,) and presently began to recite some lines that were
                  running in his head. Said he, in a truly stagical voice: "The king is dead! the
                  king is dead!"</p>
               <p>"Thunder and lightning!" exclaimed a man at the table, "why didn't you tell me so.
                  I have got my money on that card."</p>
               <p>I coppered a bet. I liked the fun. The crowd gathered around me, and I think from
                  my elegant but attenuated form, and alacrity with the "tiger," they mistook me for
                  John Morgan. Their attentions to me were astonishing. I coppered a ten dollar bill
                  on a double-headed Jack, and have never seen it since. I got a round of applause
                  on it though. They called that "pluck." Somebody said "take up them sleepers." I
                  looked around and was unable to see but one. He was a stalwart Ethiopian,
                  reclining with his head on a spittoon. I was afterwards told that the sleepers
                  were the dead bets. I observed one man who seemed to have a mathematical turn of
                  mind. The red checks were worth more than the white ones. Taking one of them in
                  his fingers, he asked: "If a piece of ivory, one inch in diameter, costs five
                  dollars, how much will an elephant come to?" I couldn't tell.</p>
               <p>I coppered another ten dollar bill through spite, and it disappeared suddenly. I
                  told the banker he didn't let my money stay on the table long enough to know
                  whether I won or lost. He insisted that he knew his "biz," and told me to try my
                  luck again. I told him if my luck continued as it had commenced my money would not
                  go a great way. He said he thought it would go a good deal further than I
                  expected. The "looker-out" began to look sick. I asked him what was the matter,
                  and he said his share of the profits of the bank consisted only in a division of
                  the silver, and he had not made a cent since the war broke out. Whereupon he
                  stalked away, whistling, "When this cruel war is over," I kept betting. I had had
                  bad luck, and I wanted revenge. As my funds diminished, I became more excited. I
                  bet recklessly. I coppered the queen for a dollar and her majesty snubbed me. The
                  tray betrayed<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5851-00000078"/> trayed me; the deuce
                  played the dickens, and the whole deck was leagued against me. Finally I planked
                  down my last five on the ace. I announced that it was my last. My particular
                  friend went around on the opposite side of the table. He caressed me no more. The
                  dealer called the ace; lost. There was a buzz for a moment, then loud laughter. My
                  smiling friends gathered on one side of me. I was about to ask my "particular" to
                  see me home, when the earth opened to receive me, I reckon. They know the plank
                  too well; they stood just right; the spring went off at the proper time, and I
                  arrived suddenly in the basement, in three feet of water and some mud. I felt, for
                  a moment, that I had been imposed upon, but as soon as I straightened up out of
                  the water I was willing to admit that such was not the case. The splash in the
                  basement attracted a policeman who was half a block distant, and he rushed to see
                  if a safe had been blown open. I told him I was a "hoc card," and I wanted him to
                  take me up tenderly. He took me up. I offered to conduct him to room No. 6. From
                  the appearance of the room one would have supposed that it had been occupied eight
                  years ago; not later. Table, green cloth, coppers, sleepers, betters, all were
                  gone. I related my story briefly to the policeman. He said if stupidity were
                  trump, I could play against the whole world. I told him that was equivalent to an
                  assertion that no policeman ever gambled, and we parted. Policemen are badly
                  brought up in this country anyhow.</p>
               <p>I have lost a good friend, and I don't know where to find him. My "particular"
                  holds forth at No. 6 no longer. The Thompsonian physic was no remedy in his case.
                  But he is a good man, and I advise every one who becomes acquainted with him to
                  cultivate him. Never desert him as long as you have any money left. It would break
                  his heart. Let his passion for play be not to his discredit. A Christian is a good
                  man, but he is a better.</p>

                  plenty of means, stuff a turkey on Thanksgiving day, and then stuff themselves.
                  New England made herself sick on a Thanksgiving dinner twenty years ago, and has
                  not got over it yet. Chicago has suffered from the incipiency of her unwellness up
                  to its worst stage, which has constantly manifested its presence by violent
                  diaphragmal convulsions, and the emptying of its population in our midst by a
                  process similar to that which would be produced in the human system by an overdose
                  of ipecacuanha or lobelia. In Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina, Thanksgiving
                  is welcomed with a log-rolling or a house-raising; in Pennsylvania with a quilting
                  party; in Mississippi a horse race is the only palpable demonstration, and in
                  Arkansas a few good sociable citizens get together and hang a man. In none of the
                  States is the pleasure that may be derived from this holiday totally neglected. I
                  never celebrated a Thanksgiving day in Arkansas; but I celebrated one in Chicago a
                  day or two ago, where no positive peculiarity characterizes the day except in the
                  matter of free lunches. All manner of people may find enjoyment here on
                  Thanksgiving days, fitting their inclinations, but after all free lunches are in
                  the ascendency. We have free lunches in saloons, and hotels, and private houses;
                  free lunches on ground floors and top floors; free lunches on the sidewalk; free
                  lunches everywhere. The man of interminable municipal possessions, whose smile is
                  auriferous (no allusion to jaundice), and whose voice is like silver or copper (no
                  allusion to a distillery,) may be invited to a magnificent Thanksgiving dinner in
                  a brown-fronted palace on the avenue, but he sits down to a free lunch; it's
                  nothing else. Free lunches are great—they are mighty—they are gorgeous. (A play on
                  the word gorgeous is played out.) Free lunches are good for a sick man; he can eat
                  them when (in reduced circumstances) he can't eat anything else. "Free press, free
                  speech and free lunches," is a motto good enough for me, or any other man. I
                  attended a Thanksgiving free lunch on the brown-fronted avenue; select. My
                  vaulting appetite overleaped itself. They had prairie chickens, port wine and
                  napkins on the table. Prairie chickens and napkins always affect my brain. Knowing
                  my weakness, I went in moderately at first, but towards the twelfth round, fired
                  with ambition and inspired by a generous rivalry, which was waged by a dozen
                  competitors on my right and left, I struck from the shoulder and went<pb
                     n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5851-00000080"/> for the small glasses with such
                  astonishing and soothing rapidity that the appearance of their evolutions from the
                  table to my mouth reminded me strikingly of a juggler's performance with brass
                  balls. The result was, that in the thirtieth round I felt bad. The host got the
                  best of the fight; the port disappeared, and "he brought the claret." A charming
                  young lady with an overpowering address, asked me if I was sick at the stomach. I
                  told the overpowering young lady I was sick at the head. Thereupon she said I
                  ought to go somewhere and laugh it off. I remember distinctly having asked her if
                  she alluded to the head or the sick.</p>
               <p>I had occasion to remark to a male friend of mine of the masculine persuasion (he
                  gender), that I thought a laugh would do me good, and asked him to tickle me in
                  the ribs, which he declined doing, saying that we had better promenade awhile and
                  search for some innocent amusement.</p>
               <p>We promenaded.</p>
               <p>Arm-in-arm, with my fellow-being, who had as much prairie chicken aboard as I had,
                  except four wings, nine legs, and twelve glasses, we encountered a man who
                  proclaimed himself treasurer of a circus. He was one of the Robinson &amp; Howes'
                  circus, the government of which is as follows: equestrian manager, Frank Howes;
                  treasurer, Lloyd Howes; director, Another Howes; outside man, Junius Brutus Howes;
                  inside man, Themistocles, Howes; clown, Pericles Howes; property man, H. Greeley
                  Howes; and others of the same family. It may seem strange to the public that there
                  should be so many of one name connected with one institution, but let me say to
                  the public, for whom I have great respect, that the success of a public
                  entertainment is always governed by its Howeses.</p>
               <p>We promenaded, me and my friend and me, and I think his proposition for a
                  promenade was occasioned by the peculiar inclination of my head at certain
                  moments, and fear for the safety of his mirrors and tapestry.</p>
               <p>The treasurer of the circus, I think, is an honest man but the management compel
                  him to wear pantaloons without pockets, for a reason unknown to me. It is probably
                  owing to the fact that, being so well used to pockets, he sometimes forgets that
                  he has a treasury box—couldn't say positively.</p>
               <p>We entered, me and my promenader and me, without much difficulty, except in the
                  way of paying for tickets.</p>
               <p>The clown made a joke as I went in, and I said to my promenader if I couldn't beat
                  that I would quit. And says he, "suppose you try your hand at it," and I replied
                  that I didn't make jokes with my hands. The manager of equerry (I don't know what
                  that means) heard me, and he glided around, and said he: I don't like my clown
                  much, and if you will take his place I'll pay you big." I accepted; the contract
                  was signed, sealed and delivered. I arose and wended my way melancholily into the
                  dressing-room (or the undressing room; the men were all undressing when I went
                  in.)</p>
               <p>I was introduced all around, to the tumblers and somersaulters, and equestrians
                  and clowns. I sneered when I came to the latter, thinking how soon I should lay
                  them in the shade. I wanted to play<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5851-00000081"/>
                  clown just five minutes. There was a volley of whispering and snickering kept up
                  several minutes after I entered, but I thought nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Finally, says one of the clowns, (his name was Castello,) said he: "Hans Patrick,
                  do you pad?"</p>
               <p>I glanced at my godlike but slender proportions, and replied, "Not vastly."</p>
               <p>"Well," said he, turning away contemptuously, "You ought to."</p>
               <p>Immediately upon the utterance of his last remark, the juvenile, vulgarly called a
                  property boy, laughed immoderately, and an application of boot leather was found
                  absolutely necessary to reduce him to a state of decent quietude.</p>
               <p>One of the tumblers said to me, (I met several tumblers, but only one pitcher, and
                  he was the man appointed to pitch boisterous people out at the door,) said he:
                  "Hans Patrick, can you stand on your head?" I replied in the negative, but told
                  him I could stand on somebody else's head if that would answer his purpose.</p>
               <p>I observed a man in the last stage of placidity lying stark still on the ground,
                  while another man was rubbing a horse-shoe over his head. I inquired the cause,
                  and was told that the proceeding was intended to make him so that he would not
                  mind having his brains kicked out.</p>
               <p>The manager asked me how I thought I would look in tights. I said I had been in
                  one every day for five years, and the public had pronounced me passable. Thereupon
                  I incased myself in a set of fleshings, and the manager offered to introduce me to
                  the equine department. The first man I met was a mule three feet high. May I eat
                  hay as long as I live; may I be compelled to eat hash at a common boarding house
                  till the crack of doom grows big enough for an elephant to go through, if the
                  manager didn't tell me that that mule's name was Hans Patrick. I looked at his
                  teeth, and endeavored to inform myself whether I had been named for the mule or
                  the mule for me, but could gain no enlightenment. It tickled me to hear it stated
                  that he was an educated mule. I wanted to cultivate his acquaintance, but the
                  feeling was not reciprocal.</p>
               <p>One of the knowing ones, after calling me a "guy," and other happy appellations,
                  said he would "make me up," and commenced spreading paint on my face with a brush
                  broom. I squared myself, manœuvered the flexors and tensors of my right arm, and I
                  think I made him up in a manner that would have won the fancy of a connoisseur. He
                  uttered a shrill cough as I planted my digits between his optics; that was a
                  signal for the whole congregation to take at hand. In two minutes there were a
                  dozen tumblers on my shoulders, sixteen trapeze men on my thorax, and a wee boy
                  doing La Perche Equipoise on the top of my head. They rolled me through the
                  stable, and Hans Patrick, Jr., elevating his hinder half in the atmosphere, like a
                  juvenile taking his first lessons in a hand-spring, brought his two heels suddenly
                  in contact with my cranium. I did not stop to argue the question with my
                  illustrious namesake, but if ever he appears in the circus here, I'll hiss him.
                  Mark that.</p>
               <p>I found my way out through a cylinder escapement, with a black eye and a sore
                  head, and such<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5851-00000082"/> epithets attached to me
                  as "nixe wooden," "sherry his nibs," and a hundred other phrases that nobody but a
                  circus man knows anything about.</p>
               <p>I wanted to send a pair of pantaloons to my brother in the army once, and an
                  express agent wouldn't send them because they were inexpressibles. The public will
                  excuse me if I fail to express my opinion of circusses on the same principle. I am
                  opposed to them morally and physically, especially the latter. Henceforth they
                  will find no sympathy, no balm of Gilead in my bosom. They may name their mules in
                  honor of me if they want to, and their horses too, and pigs, and pups, and
                  everything else, but they can never rope me in to play clown again. I've got
                  enough.</p>

                  <l>Slowly and sadly he at length arose,</l>

               <head>MINISTERING ANGELS.</head>
               <p>MR. EDITOR:—I want to address a few words to your paper for a double purpose. I
                  want to tell your readers what a good thing it is to be sick once in a while, and
                  to vindicate a certain class towards whom I have not hitherto entertained opinions
                  of the most flattering kind.</p>
               <p>The luxury of convalescence must be felt to be appreciated. Why, I have had an
                  old-fashioned clock in my house for fifteen years, and I suppose it has been
                  ticking all the time, but (as I live!) I never heard it until since I became ill.
                  Now I hear it all the time. Day and night, tick, tick, tick, there is that same
                  old sound, but it assumes ten thousand different keys, or forms, or whatever you
                  may choose to call them, according to the frame of mind I happen to be in. Like
                  Master Dombey, who, in his ceaseless and unhappy illness constantly imagined the
                  old clock saying, "how do you do, my little friend?" I can also imagine that it is
                  forever repeating words suited to my case.</p>
               <p>And then the women-folks. Je-rusalem lemons! Ain't they "some" in slickness? I
                  recant. I stand (or lie at present) in the same category with old Dumas. Once I
                  thought that woman was the author of<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5851-00000086"/>
                  such a book of follies in a man that 'twould take the tears of all the angels to
                  blot the record out. But I begin to see now what a stupid dunce I was!</p>
               <p>Believe me, I have had an opportunity recently of judging of the good qualities of
                  the fair sex, as developed by suffering and distress. During my sickness the wives
                  and daughters, and sisters and aunts, and grandmothers of my creditors clustered
                  around me like blue-bottle flies around the bung-hole of a sugar cask on the Levee
                  in the middle of July. They invested largely in my welfare; you bet. Barring their
                  incessant chat about having my life insured, their society was very agreeable, and
                  I have no doubt I am largely indebted to them for my present prosperity. In such
                  an assemblage, however, there was, of course, great diversity of character, and
                  that same diversity served to cheer and stimulate me in the darkest hour.</p>
               <p>There was one very ancient and highly respectable lady who seemed filled with a
                  bitter resolution to play "roots" on me—as the ragamuffins say. In her estimation,
                  there was nothing under the sun so reliable as roots. There was the blackberry
                  root, and the gentian root, and the sassafras root, and the square root, and the
                  cube root, and a thousand other roots, which she wanted to combine into one grand
                  elephantine, final and conclusive dose for my especial benefit, which I very
                  graciously declined. "What does Dr. Gunn say?" she asked emphatically. "What does
                  he say? There, see for yourself; in the first part of his book. He says: 'When
                  disease begins to take hold of the system, <emph>root</emph> it out.' Now."</p>
               <p>I was convinced, but I didn't take the roots.</p>
               <p>If there is any one thing in this world I dislike more than another, its
                  spoon-victuals—particularly gruel. At least such has been the case in days gone
                  by. Some men there are who cannot bear a harmless, necessary cat, and some also
                  who cannot bear a gaping pig. So Shylock says, and so, through all the years of my
                  life, I have had an unaccountable antipathy to gruel. But when I rose up in bed
                  one day and saw standing near me a malignant compound of smiles and dimples, and
                  laces and flounces, and when I saw her black eyes beaming with love and
                  tenderness, as if she wanted to be waiting on all the sick people in the world at
                  once, and when she plucked me under the chin (O Lordy!) with her dear little
                  finger, and pointing to a bowl and spoon which she held in one hand, reminding me
                  of a picture I used to see in my boyhood, entitled, "Belle of the West," and said,
                  "now you must take some gruel for <emph>me</emph>"—Sir, I would have taken down
                  that gruel if it had been a coal of fire, and I had known there was a keg of
                  powder in my stomach.</p>
               <p>I can stand up like a hero now and knock a bowl of gruel into a continental hat
                  three times a day, so much have I been wrought upon.</p>
               <p>I tell you the very air of a sick room is fragrant where woman goes—"whose faint
                  footfalls tinkle on the tufted floor."</p>
               <p>The very nature of the creature is healing. She is, and was, and always has been a
                  medicine—a sovereign remedy within herself—and every male, whether sick or well,
                  ought to take a dose. Observe her. If a plant is withering, she has only to touch
                  it and it springs into new life. If a Canary bird<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000087"/> droops and becomes despondent, she tells it to
                  cheer up, and it chirrups. In her hands calomel and ipecac become nectar; nasty,
                  good-for-nothing little pills are suddenly transmogrified into apples of gold in
                  boxes of silver; and your room, which awhile ago smelt like a condemned apothecary
                  shop, becomes as delicious as the perfumes of a thousand flowers, and a fitting
                  abode for the choicest creations of mythology. Things animate and inanimate are
                  alike obedient to her charmed influence. So am I. Verily, I believe I can tell
                  when a yard of crinoline comes within two hundred yards of my house, by the
                  refreshing breeze that enters my chamber window.</p>
               <p>But I am feeble and will forbear. I chanced to look out just now, when I beheld a
                  spectacle (a common one) that caused the current of my thoughts to take a new
                  turn. It was a rough, uncouth wooden coffin, hurrying toward some Potter's field.
                  I thought maybe if the inmate had had some creditors to send their female
                  relations to look after his interests, he might have remained a little longer. In
                  other words, with more nursing, there would be less dying. But what right have I
                  to such reflections? I will leave these thoughts to humanitarians.</p>

               <head>TRAINING FOR THE "TOURNAMENT."</head>
               <p>"Richard," if I may be permitted to indulge in a somewhat obscure quotation, "is
                  himself again." From the utmost degree of languor and debility, I have risen to
                  the very pinnacle of health, happiness and hilarity. I am out of the "kinks," so
                  to speak, and like the crafty king on one occasion, whose name I have already
                  mentioned, I came out clamoring for "a horse!" the wherefore I shall at once
                  proceed to state.</p>
               <p>Having been attracted by a notice of a tournament that was to transpire during the
                  approaching Fair of the Southern Relief Association, and being myself in ardent
                  sympathy with that charitable movement, as well as a devout communicant at the
                  shrine of chivalry in whatever shape, form, fashion or attitude it appears, I
                  could neither eat, sleep, nor carry my head erect, until I had made arrangements
                  to compete for the prize and victory on the notable occasion now near unto us,
                  drawing. Day and night I was either thinking or dreaming of the handsome figure I
                  would cut, with spear and helmet, mounted on my Belphegor or Bucephalus, and
                  parading the arena for the admiration of the excited multitude. I could see ten
                  thousand young ladies, all in a marriageable<pb n="174-175"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000088"/> condition and lovely as Diana, standing erect and
                  waving their sweet-scented handkerchiefs in acknowledgment of my gallantry and
                  courage, and I could see them scrutinizing, through their lorgnettes, the star on
                  my helmet, and the diamond cross on my bosom, and the tin buckles (mistaken for
                  silver) on my knee-breeches. And then I could see me gracefully prostrating
                  myself, like an elephant at prayer, in front of the most beautiful, and
                  bewitching, and fascinating creature that ever the sun shone on, and afterwards
                  rising, and, after a multiplicity of bows and blushes, performing the ceremony of
                  the coronation, while my competitors stood around me, pictures of discomfiture and
                  silent envy, and the five million people (apparently) present rending the welkin
                  with joyous acclamations, quoting in their hearts those famous lines from Dryden, <q>
                     <l>"None but the brave deserve the fair,"</l>
                  </q> and very much in doubt, in their own minds, whether the quotation had
                  reference to the fair sex or the Fair of the Southern Relief Association. All this
                  I saw, and I felt—well, it's no use talking—I felt huge.</p>
               <p>Of course, before I could accomplish all this, I must take the preliminary
                  measures to be admitted to the contest. A friend instructed me where to go and who
                  to call upon—the chairman of some committee—though why "chairman," I don't know,
                  for he was standing all the time. Perhaps it was a standing committee. I visited
                  the house designated, and saw whom I supposed to be the proper person.</p>
               <p>"Sir," I said, "I have come to enter."</p>
               <p>"Walk right in, then, sir," was the cool response.</p>
               <p>"Hem! Beg pardon," I continued, "I believe you do not comprehend me. I want to
                  enter the lists."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you do? Very good; put you in the lists at once, sir. Got cholera, eh? Name
                  and residence?"</p>
               <p>"Cholera—no!" I thundered, growing considerably excited under the impression that
                  he was quizzing me. "Do I look like a man with the cholera? No, sir; I want to
                  enter the list for the Tournament. Is not this the place?"</p>
               <p>"Not by any means," he replied, smiling all over, and rubbing his hands fatly. "A
                  slight mistake, I reckon. This is the Health Office. We look after the sick here.
                  If you have cholera, we can provide for you. If you are dead, we will bury you, if
                  you have a certificate from the attendant physician."</p>
               <p>"The d—l you will," was at the tip of my tongue, but I restrained myself and said:
                  "Sir, your kindness is so confoundedly overpowering that I don't know how to thank
                  you. You will, therefore, excuse me." And I sailed out, with a gallon of fleas in
                  each ear, and an intense suspicion that I had been egregiously humbugged.</p>
               <p>I found the right place at last, however, and stated my case. The courteous
                  committee man asked me for my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nom de guerre</foreign>.
                  Told him I had no daguerreotype, but would give him a photograph if that would do.
                  He said I misunderstood him; he wanted my fighting name. Told him I had no
                  fighting name, but my fighting weight was 212 pounds avoirdupois. Another
                  explanation followed, and I told him he might register "Knight of the Freedmen's
                  Bureau," and he might add, in parenthesis, that I was a very dark night. "You are
                  more than knight, then," he<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5851-00000089"/> said,
                  laughingly. "Yes," I replied, "I'm just old nitre." After this friendly passage at
                  arms, we parted sadly, neither one asking the other what he would take.</p>
               <p>And now for the practice, I thought—to brush up my equestrianism. I procured a
                  suitable horse from a first-class livery-stable, and armed with a spear of the
                  required length, retired to an open lot in the vicinity of my dwelling to "train."
                  The three-inch rings were placed at proper intervals, and taking my position, at a
                  given signal, which I gave myself, I started, confident I would make a clean sweep
                  of the rings the very first tilt. Doubtless I would have done so, but for an
                  unfortunate circumstance. Just as my charger came within about six feet of the
                  first ring, a wagon load of oats passed outside the enclosure, seeing which, he
                  wheeled and shot himself off in that direction. Over a six-foot fence he went like
                  a wild gazelle or an old he-sheep, my hat sailed off on an eddying gale like a
                  thing of life, my spear struck a stake and was shivered, and I shivered myself,
                  for I thought every moment would be my next. "Whoa!" I shouted, and the horse
                  having overtaken the load of oats, he "whoa'd."</p>
               <p>This <foreign xml:lang="FRA">contretemps</foreign> attracted quite a concourse of
                  children, as such occurrences always do, who began to regale me with sundry
                  endearing exclamations and admonitions, such as "Whooray! see old Lummax ride!"
                  "Get down and carry your horse, you are the biggest;" to all of which I replied in
                  unspeakable silence.</p>
               <p>I have a contempt for children, on the same principle, I suppose, that a bankrupt
                  despises money.</p>
               <p>The weather being rather warm, the exertion of remounting caused my too solid
                  flesh to thaw a little, and the crystal globules began to stand in such vast
                  profusion upon my face, that I must have looked like a diamond-studded night,
                  gotten up at enormous expense.</p>
               <p>"Whoa!" I said, thrusting my hat on my head as firmly as if it had had a mortgage
                  on it, and burying my heels in my horse's flanks.</p>
               <p>I was up for another trial. But what aggravated me beyond endurance was the
                  gathering of a little bevy of ladies on a sidewalk near by, who seemed determined
                  to linger until my exercises were over. I can stand anything but a lot of females,
                  or females on a lot staring at me. I can go into a battle without a shudder, and
                  have done it. Once I contended, single-handed, against five hundred men and was
                  struck with a shell. Extraordinary shell, too, that—had a chicken in it, and smelt
                  like Greek fire. That was nothing, but to experiment before a dozen gaping
                  feminines—it quite overpowered me. Especially did I collapse when one of them with
                  shocking familiarity, remarked contemptuously as I rode by:</p>
               <p>"Can't ride that horse? Pooh! I could ride him barebacked!"</p>
               <p>"Madame," said I, rallying, "with all due respect for your sex, etc., allows me to
                  inform you that I have no desire to see you ride barebacked."</p>
               <p>There was a pause among them, then a twitter, then a stampede, as if they had
                  suddenly got something "through their wool," and I was much rejoiced.</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5851-00000090"/>
               <p>"Whoa!" I said, planting myself at the head of the stretch again.</p>
               <p>At that moment I discovered an old hoop-skirt that had been discarded for a
                  better, perhaps, by a prosperous owner, containing numerous steel hoops full three
                  feet in diameter. It struck me it would be better to practice with these hoops a
                  while before trying the smaller rings. I knew I could hit them if I could hit
                  anything; then I could diminish their size gradually as my skill increased. The
                  plan was adopted; the small rings were removed, and the hoops substituted.</p>
               <p>"Whoa!" I said—then straightening myself in the saddle, I gave my steed the reins
                  and he started.</p>
               <p>Whether that horse had ever belonged to a circus or any other organization of
                  mountebanks, I am not prepared to say, but he certainly conducted himself in a
                  manner that no well-bred animal would be guilty of. No sooner had he reached the
                  hoops than, instead of passing them at a respectable distance, as any sane horse
                  would have done, he plunged right through them, and I became entangled in wire
                  from head to foot. I had to release my hold on the reins to save my arms, then
                  away he went through streets and alleys, over fences, and palings and railings,
                  while windows flew up in all directions, and the people shouted as if they enjoyed
                  it hugely. Gilpin wasn't a circumstance. But the worst was not come. The horse
                  tried to leap a fence that was about an inch too high, and his hoof struck it. You
                  should have seen us part company. I hated to give him up, but I did—and as I came
                  down in the midst of a potato-patch, head-foremost, I wondered if the man who
                  owned the potatoes would be mean enough to prosecute me for trespass. For some
                  seconds I reminded myself of Mazeppa in the last act, and tried to believe that I
                  was insensible—it was a failure. The ground was too soft.</p>
               <p>Presently a kind-hearted man caught my horse and brought him to me. Then I got
                  up.</p>
               <p>"Guess somebody's been playin' tricks on you," said he.</p>
               <p>"Why?" said I.</p>
               <p>"'Cause," said he, "they've put a bramble bough under your horse's tail."</p>
               <p>It was true, as there is a world. Those mischievous, those wicked, those—I could
                  almost say cussed—boys had played me this trick when I was not expecting it.</p>
               <p>"Whoa!" I said, taking the horse's reins gently, but I never mounted him again. I
                  felt like one who treads alone some banquet hall deserted, and, avoiding the
                  public gaze as much as possible, I left the outskirts of the city, and wended my
                  way toward my residence, my noble horse following at my heels.</p>
               <p>I will triumph yet. I will train again where there are no boys and no brambles,
                  and I will be him of the proud and victorious lance who shall crown some gay and
                  festive creature, Queen of Beauty, love, etc. I will enter the arena, and whoa,
                  whoa, to my competitors.</p>

               <p>It may be gratifying to many to learn that the price of board has ascended to such
                  a fearful altitude that I have found it impossible to support a life of general
                  utility and elegant indolence, and liquidate my boarding-house liabilities
                  regularly every quarter, as formerly. Consequently, I have altered my mode of
                  living altogether, and, as a beginning, I have taken a house in the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Rue de Fifth Street.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>Extras are becoming too frequent entirely at common boarding-houses. The last week
                  I boarded, my landlady had nothing but what was extra. If I wanted a clean pillow,
                  it was put down extra. Everything was extra. Coffee for breakfast, soup for
                  dinner, and cold slaw for supper, were always charged extra, and there never was
                  anything else on the table. Last week, to cap the climax, the landlady wanted to
                  charge me extra for a chair to sit in at table, and said with great force of
                  argument that in these war times, "chairs is chairs." I was glad of the
                  information, for the one I had been using for a whole week previous was a
                  three-legged stool. She also took exceptions to my manner of transacting business,
                  and said I ought to pay up every month or<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5851-00000093"
                  /> two. The idea of a woman teaching me how to do business, when I never asked her
                  for a situation as book-keeper. Ridiculous! But she kept on complaining and
                  frowning, nevertheless, and at last began to treat me uncivilly. Every time I went
                  home for a warm meal I got a cold shoulder. I could stand no more, and so I have
                  left, resolved henceforth to defy boarding-houses, and live on my own
                  responsibility. I left nothing with my former landlady, except a few dollars in
                  debt, which she is welcome to.</p>
               <p>New Yorkers, who have resided on Fifth avenue, when they come to St. Louis to
                  reside, usually locate on Fifth street, because it is next to Fourth, and they
                  naturally suppose it to be the Fifth. I never lived in New York. One of my
                  grandfathers was a Cockney and lived in the West End; hence I have chosen my abode
                  as above.</p>
               <p>My house is a palace, compared with some houses I have seen on the Potomac during
                  the war. There are at least a hundred persons who have houses under the same roof
                  with mine. The one I occupy is twelve feet one way and twelve feet back again, and
                  is situated on the first floor from the top of the house. My neighbors are all
                  anxious to become acquainted with me because I have a box of blacking in my house,
                  but I can shake them off as well as I can.</p>
               <p>I have been making preparations to keep house in the very best style, and I don't
                  know but I will do my own cooking after a while, though I have my meals brought to
                  me now, I bought a bucket of coal the other day. I don't need fire much at
                  present, but the price of coal may advance as the winter advances vances and there
                  is nothing like domestic economy and cool calculation. I tried to hire a man
                  servant the other day, but he wanted to charge me a dollar a week, and have his
                  time to himself every night after midnight. I won't be imposed upon, if I am
                  inexperienced in house-keeping. I have bought a considerable lot of queensware,
                  and some kingsware, including a boot-jack.</p>
               <p>Altogether, I flatter myself I have about as thorough an outfit for a limited
                  business as any gentleman could desire. My mahogany may be a little inferior, but
                  the floor of my residence is of as good white oak timber as eye ever gazed or foot
                  ever trod upon.</p>
               <p>In rambling around among my acquaintances, I have observed that it is a custom
                  among business men to keep in their offices large or small boxes full of
                  pigeon-holes, in which they deposit valuable papers. My house is not an office
                  exactly, but it comes nearer being one than anything else I have, or ever will
                  have, unless a generous public shall one day appreciate my talents, and make me an
                  alderman. So, to be up with the fashion, I have purchased a box full of
                  pigeon-holes, in which to deposit my valuable papers. The style in which most of
                  these boxes are made is ridiculous; the boxes are all of the same size; and no
                  business man ever has equal quantities of all kinds of papers. My pigeon-holes air
                  arranged on scientific principles. The size of every hole is governed by its
                  requirements; and that you may understand something about my private and public
                  transactions, I herewith present a diagram of the whole, which includes all the
                  holes:</p>

               <p>It will be observed by a glance at the preceding diagram, that unpaid bills hold
                  unqualified dominion over the whole arrangement. This is no fault of mine, I
                  assure you. Unpaid bills are sent to me rapidly, and I must make some disposition
                  of them. Why don't men send me paid bills, so that I can equalize my boxes?
                  Because they won't. When a person tells me his bill has been standing long enough,
                  I tell him to let it run awhile. I am always accommodating, and ready to point out
                  to others the road to happiness. I can do no more. If a man will neither let his
                  bill run nor stand, he must let it rest.</p>

               <head>AMONG THE MILLINERS.</head>
               <p>EDITOR OF REPUBLICAN:—I was fowling in the marshes of Illinois when I received
                  your note. I was preying remorselessly upon the feathered tribe generally, with a
                  double-barreled shot gun. My ammunition was about exhausted. I had started with a
                  quart bottle full of powder in my breast pocket, but that was all gone except a
                  "snit." My shot pouch was almost empty, too, but I did not care for that. A man
                  can hunt well enough without shot if he only has plenty of powder—the kind that
                  flies to the head.</p>
               <p>Your message arrived in good time to be heeded. I had just got a splendid duck—by
                  falling off a log into a stream of muddy water. I felt so much elated by my
                  success, that I was ready to quit. Only a few hours previous to that, I had slain
                  a dozen of the plumpest ducks I ever saw. Before I had time to collect them
                  together, the owner appeared upon the field of carnage, and informed me that they
                  were his ducks, and were not wild, and never had been. The owner's name was Drake.
                  You can imagine how I felt when I learned that my ducks were all Drake's. I gave
                  them up like a reasonable<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5851-00000095"/> man, and
                  charged him nothing for killing them. I can be generous whenever I like.</p>
               <p>After so many related successes, it is not strange that I felt ready to leave the
                  field. I read the cabalistic line of your message—"come up and do the openings." I
                  wanted to come bad enough, but I had no idea what the missive meant. There are so
                  many openings in the world—so many things that can be opened. There are letters
                  for instance; letters that belong to you and letters that don't; and there is
                  champagne that can be opened; so can ink bottles; so can a batik; so can oysters
                     (<emph>can oysters</emph>). When I arrived at oysters I stopped awhile, and it
                  occurred to me that I had caught your idea. Somebody was going to open a can of
                  oysters—the first of the season, maybe—and you wanted me to report the affair.
                  Accordingly I came to the city in great haste, my speed being accelerated by a
                  knowledge of the fact that my powder was all gone, and there is no good powder
                  outside of St. Louis. I was disappointed, not disagreeably, however, when I was
                  informed that the grand season of opening millinery and straw goods had arrived,
                  and that I was wanted to make a tour of our city, and make an article on spring
                  fashions.</p>
               <p>I felt complimented when I was told that I was the man for the position, because I
                  had a more intimate acquaintance with milliners, and could get information from
                  the fair sex better than anybody else. I am susceptible of flattery, a little, and
                  I felt complimented, but I mistrusted my ability. I have not had much experience
                  in reporting. I wrote local items for three days on a country newspaper six years
                  ago, and some of them are going the rounds of the press yet. I ought to have had
                  them copyrighted, for they are never credited to me. I will give you one of
                  them—the first I ever wrote, and which is reproduced in the papers every month or
                  two. It is pretty good, and will give you an inkling of my style: <q>
                     <p>ACCIDENT.—Yesterday a team attached to a wagon rushed madly down one of our
                        principal streets a distance of a mile or two, and were only prevented from
                        running away by a gentleman who, at the hazard of his life, seized them by
                        the reins and stopped them. We are fearfully and wonderfully made.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If you hear of anybody that wants to engage a man to write that sort of items all
                  the time, I wish you would let me know it.</p>
               <p>I commenced at the corner of the square to do the fashions. I went through the
                  principal stores from one end to another, and up stairs and down, but I could find
                  no display of millinery there. I then struck out boldly up Fourth street, and came
                  to a large house nearly opposite a large house on the opposite side of the street.
                  I am thus precise in giving localities, that the public may know where the best
                  millinery store is to be found. A reliable gentleman, to whom truth is a greater
                  stranger than fiction, told me that the second story of the large house on the
                  opposite side of the street was a bonnet and straw goods establishment. This was
                  the information I was looking for, and bounded up stairs <q>
                     <l>"Like a wild gazelle,"</l>
                  </q> if I may be allowed to institute a comparison. At<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000096"/> this time I was absorbed in deep meditation,
                  thinking how I should begin my article, and whether I should puff anybody. I was
                  abstracted, I think, and I sailed up the stairway with my body bent forward about
                  nineteen degrees from the perpendicular, a pencil under my arm, and a reporter's
                  book over my right ear. I reached the head of the stairs suddenly, inasmuch as I
                  was going very rapidly, and as a consequence of my abstractedness, or something
                  else, I drove my head plump into a bonnet that the proprietress was showing to a
                  customer. I was terribly frightened, and tried to stammer an apology, but it was
                  no go. The proprietress looked reaping machines at me. I threw my pencil down and
                  begged pardon for smoking in her presence, thinking it was a cigar. Told her I
                  hoped I hadn't smashed anything, and she smiled a little and said I hadn't. Then I
                  felt better, and told her I was a reporter. Then she looked milder than ever, and
                  said, "Oh, indeed!" and immediately afterward she became insufferably inquisitive,
                  asked me a volley of incomprehensible questions, and stared at me all the time, as
                  though she was counting the plaits in my shirt ruffles, or the links in my watch
                  chain, or the brilliants in my breastpin, or anything else you like.</p>
               <p>"Are you long-hand or short-hand?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Neither," said I, "I'm a new hand, and I rather dislike the business, as far as
                  I've got."</p>
               <p>The proprietress conducted me through a long hall into a large room occupied by
                  about twenty bonnets and sixty milliners, saleswomen, &amp;c. I did not look at
                  the bonnets much for the first half hour, but devoted voted myself exclusively to
                  taking an inventory of the young ladies.</p>
               <p>"This is a charming bonnet—golden dun—Maria Stuart front," said the
                  lady-in-chief.</p>
               <p>"Yes, she is," I replied; "but her hair is a little too red."</p>
               <p>I discovered my mistake when it was too late to correct it. That's my luck.</p>
               <p>As soon as the divine little milliners learned who I was, they gathered around me
                  in a circle, and all were anxious to see who could say the most and the best
                  things. One was descanting upon the beauties of a chip bonnet, and another handed
                  me a bunch of grapes to examine. I bit one of the grapes, and got my mouth full of
                  broken glass. Then I thought I would rather report a camp meeting than a millinery
                  store; then I thought I wouldn't, and I mustered my courage and made another note
                  in my note book, (grapes not sour but sharp). My tongue bled fearfully; and I
                  spoiled my best embroidered handkerchief wiping away the blood. The circle
                  diminished, and the crowd (perhaps I should say the bevy) came close. I began to
                  want fresh air severely. Too many females in a close room render the atmosphere
                  oppressive.</p>
               <p>"This is beautiful," said a charming creature with pearly eyes and black teeth;
                  "this is a dear duck of a bonnet."</p>
               <p>"Is it a wild duck?" said I; "I've had enough of wild ducks, especially if they
                  belong to a man by the name of Drake."</p>
               <p>"Price, seventy-five dollars," she continued, paying<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000097"/> ing about as little attention to me as a man of my
                  qualifications could expect.</p>
               <p>I asked her if she would sell it in small lots, and how much one of the straws
                  would come to, but before I had finished the question she was showing me something
                  else.</p>
               <p>The ladies became less timid as they became more acquainted, and approached so
                  near me when they wanted to give me a bonnet to look at, that my ruffles were in
                  danger of being crushed. They piled bonnets upon me till I had both arms full and
                  the top ones began to fall off, and every time I stooped to pick up one I dropped
                  two. It required some skillful engineering to keep from being engulphed in the
                  ocean of crinoline that surrounded me, and in making a desperate effort to escape
                  from one particular billow that came fearfully near me, I plunged both feet into a
                  magnificent French chip bonnet (that was the name of it,) with a Maria Stuart or
                  Louisa Jane Susan Smith front, I forget which. There was another crash of glass
                  artificials, a bunch of wheat was crushed to flour, and a fine blush rose blushed
                  for the last time. The milliners all screamed—the circle was broken; some rushed
                  one way and some another, and some rushed in an opposite direction. I rushed to
                  the window, and measured the distance to the ground with my mathematical eye. I
                  had not made up my mind exactly, when a ten-year-old, whom I had not seen before,
                  (I think she was an apprentice,) sung out in a shrill voice: "Ma says if you don't
                  pay her for the last shirt she made for you she'll prosecute you in the
                  court-house."</p>
               <p>I should have been proud to know that I had an acquaintance there if I had not
                  been in a hurry. I threw myself out upon the sidewalk without breaking a bone—I
                  still live. When next I go to report a millinery affair, I shall go in a full suit
                  of armor.</p>

               <head>AN EQUESTRIAN FAIR.</head>
               <p>I have ascertained by philosophical experiments that the temperature of equestrian
                  fairs is frigid—eminently frigid. There has been an equestrian fair at the
                  Washington skating park during the week past, and from observations made with a
                  powerful instrument on that occasion, I am convinced that either equestrian fairs
                  or skating parks are cold.</p>
               <p>There was a warm and cordial invitation sent to everybody to be present. Warm and
                  cordial! Comment is unnecessary. I went, and saw nothing warm from the time I got
                  there till I came back, and the cordial could not be had for less than ten cents a
                  glass, with leaves in it at that.</p>
               <p>The first day, I was told, was to be devoted exclusively to exhibitions of
                  equestrianism by gentlemen and Indians. I didn't know whether I was to infer from
                  that that the Indians were all females, or that Indian men are not gentlemen. Not
                  knowing what to infer, I inferred nothing.</p>
               <p>There were five prizes, consisting principally of watches, to be distributed among
                  the best gentlemen equestrians, the best watch to the best rider, the second best
                  watch to the second best rider, and so on. I think the prizes were not of the
                  right sort for this<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5851-00000099"/> season of the year,
                  in this latitude. If I had been the manager, I should have made the list of prizes
                  about as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First—Ten pounds of quinine.</item>
                  <item>Second—Two gallons of French brandy, and four pounds of Cayenne
                     pepper.</item>
                  <item>Third—Forty bottles Fever and Ague Exterminator.</item>
                  <item>Fourth—Forty boxes of cough medicine.</item>
                  <item>Fifth—One mug of hot whiskey, with pepper in it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It was a warm day when I paid my entry fee, or I never could have been induced to
                  take part in the fair. I of course thought it would remain warm, as the weather is
                  generally about one temperature in this climate till it changes. However, having
                  lavished one dollar in support of the enterprise, I was determined to reap the
                  reward, rain or shine. I rode a borrowed horse, to be in keeping with everybody
                  else. His name was Chills and Fever, and he was a magnificent moire antique steed
                  that would have been an ornament to any lot of government horses ever sold in this
                  city. I would have ridden Lead Mines, whose name has already figured before the
                  public, but he was prostrated by the cold snap, and was not able to stand on more
                  than one leg at a time.</p>
               <p>I rode out to the skating park in the afternoon of the first fair day. Reapers and
                  icicles! I mean the first day of the fair. My horse was richly caparisoned with a
                  four-shilling bridle and a Spanish saddle, to give him a foreign aspect. The arena
                  was dotted with horsemen when I arrived. They were exercising their horses to keep
                  up the circulation. The long rows of seats in the great amphitheatre were speckled
                  with spectators and spectres. A more ghostly-looking ing concourse of people I
                  never had the pleasure of gazing upon. It was an easy matter to count their noses
                  from the centre of the arena. They looked for all the world like so many
                  blue-birds.</p>
               <p>I dismounted, blew my breath on my finger-ends, and was introduced to
                  We-kaw-ga-shiver-all-day-for-a-dollar-ah, the chief of the squad of Indians who
                  were going to ride for ear-rings and frosted fruit-pins. He gazed complacently, I
                  may say coldly, on surrounding things, and seemed sadly affected by the conspiracy
                  of the elements. I was struck by a remark of his, made while the band was playing.
                  He said he wished the women wouldn't let their teeth chatter so much, he wanted to
                  hear the moosic.</p>
               <p>Everybody was in agony, particularly ladies with false teeth, who were continually
                  shaking them out of their mouths. The band played nothing but cold airs, and
                  gentlemen stood around with their hands in their pockets, talking of nothing but
                  how to keep warm. I got ashamed of keeping my hands in my pockets so much, and for
                  change, put them in another man's pockets. He took umbrage thereat, and was going
                  to warm himself by pounding my head, but I had become so insufferably cold that I
                  thought I had better run a while, and by that means I got away from him. The
                  horses suffered from the cold weather, too. I saw a number of them stamping their
                  feet on the ground to keep them warm. My horse was not as cold as the others,
                  because he had a blaze face. Those persons who rode fiery horses were the most
                  enviable in the arena. Little boys with thin clothing on went dangerously near the
                  animals, with perfect impunity, in order to keep from freezing.</p>
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5851-00000100"/>
               <p>A gentleman with a double-breasted overcoat buttoned around him, and a full set of
                  furs on his upper lip, remarked to me that he thought the contest that evening
                  would be a hot one.</p>
               <p>"Will it?" said I, thrusting my bands, gauntlets and all, as far under my vest as
                  possible; "I am glad of it, for everything else is cold."</p>
               <p>My friend then gave his furs an extra twirl, and observed that I did not seem to
                  take much interest in the fair; I was lukewarm.</p>
               <p>"If I look warm," I replied, "I am a man of deceitful appearances. I am not what
                  you take me to be. I am not what I think I am. I don't live where I board." Then I
                  walked away icily, biting the wrinkles out of my cold, unmoving fingers of scorn,
                  and wishing heartily that somebody would make a flaming speech for my benefit.</p>
               <p>If I only could have met a young lady whose eyes sparkled the least bit
                  imaginable, I would have bid farewell to my blissful dreams of bachelorhood, and
                  struck a match immediately. I never knew the worth of a flame before. A capacious
                  old cove (or cave) with a hot-air furnace and rectifying distillery in his
                  stomach, who could burn a hole through a two-inch board by blowing his breath on
                  it, said the cold weather was good for the ladies, it was "health-giving and a
                  great beautifier." As the last syllable of the "beautifier" came out, I leaped out
                  of my boots almost, and if my muscles had not been benumbed and paralyzed, I
                  should have made myself an eternal benefactor of the temperance cause by upsetting
                  one rum establishment anyhow.</p>
               <p>About three o'clock the competitors were notified to mount and form a line in
                  front of the judges' stand. I asked the chief marshal if he could not arrange for
                  us to ride in the direction the wind was blowing. "Not much," he said, but he
                  would try and make arrangements to have the wind blow in the direction we were
                  going to ride.</p>
               <p>The horses were all numbered, and as they came in front of the stand, the numbers
                  were taken by the awarding committee. I brought up the rear. "What is your
                  number?" said one of the committee, addressing himself to me. "Twenty degrees
                  below zero, Fahrenheit," and I thrust my toes in my horse's flanks, whence I
                  derived a little warmth, the first I had felt all day.</p>
               <p>The announcement came that we must first ride in platoons of four, next in
                  divisions of two, and their in brigades of one at a time, driving the horses on a
                  run, gallop, trot, canter, walk and creep. Chills and Fever got himself up in good
                  shape, and I started off favorably. But the effects of chilled iron stirrups on
                  one's feet on a cold day, through papier maché boots, is terrible, and act the end
                  of the first quarter of the track I had to get down and dance a while. I danced
                  till my competitors came round again, when I remounted, put the reins between my
                  teeth, muffled my hands, and started a second time. I heard a loud burst of
                  applause at the judges' stand, which I imagined was intended for me. Before I had
                  gone much farther, I came to a house with the sign "Refreshments" on the door. I
                  dismounted again, and went in on the refresh heavily. There was a huge stove in
                  the room, and the first thing I did was to embrace it and kiss the stovepipe. I
                  was beginning to feel<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5851-00000101"/> gloriously warm,
                  when an unprincipled follow told me there was no fire in the stove. I was all
                  right till I made that discovery, after which I was as cold as ever.</p>
               <p>But the man behind the bar had a fellow-feeling and he told me he had a good, fire
                  in another room. We went in together, and I got some of the cordial with leaves in
                  it. It is astonishing how time flies when a body has been out in the cold. I
                  supposed I had not been by the fire more than two hours, and that I would reach
                  the next stopping place just in time to get the second premium. I rode up to the
                  stand fearlessly, and with the aid of my quizzing glass was unable to discover any
                  human being. On one of the seats was a box addressed to me, with a picture of
                  Kane's Arctic Expedition on it. I began to feel that I had been humbugged; that
                  the judges, who had discovered my superior riding, were partial to somebody else,
                  and had run away to keep from giving me a prize. I opened the box and found
                  several yards of black ribbon, together with a chilled iron medal, on which was
                  this inscription: "Presented to Hans Patrick Le Connor, for riding around the ring
                  in a greater length of time than anybody else." I tied the ribbon to my horse's
                  head, and rode around the circle three times, as is customary with those who have
                  taken a prize. Soon after that, a solitary horseman, shivering considerably, might
                  have been seen leaving the outskirts of the city, and wending his way towards the
                  inskirts.</p>
               <p>I shall never go to another equestrian fair in cold weather, unless there is a
                  horse-race in connection with it, and plenty of heats.</p>

               <head>SABBATH RECREATIONS.</head>
               <p>Speculation as to how we shall kill time, when time never hesitates in choosing
                  its method of killing us, is by no means least among the follies to which the
                  human family is radically addicted. That morsel of infinitude which, like the
                  preface to some old book, is too frequently regarded as an insufferable bore, and
                  which is itself but an introductory to the great volume of eternity, is a source
                  of interminable irritation to a vast number of the inhabitants of this sublunary
                  orb, who are sometimes as much annoyed about the passing of their time as if it
                  were so much counterfeit money. As regards myself, I am free to confess that I am
                  no exception to the general rule, and that the dull routine and monotony of
                  commonplace existence have too often driven me to excesses which have almost
                  proved the ruin of this "once godlike, but now fragile," etc., etc., etc.</p>
               <p>You shall judge for yourself. You shall hear from my facile Faber pencil, No. 2,
                  how, in the innocence and blossomhood of youth, I have been decoyed into
                  adventures, experiments and associations, escape from which, without everlasting
                  contamination, was little less than miraculous.</p>
               <p>On a recent Sabbath, when nature seemed to have<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000102"/> put on her celebrating robes, as to do homage to
                  some great occasion; when every breeze came heavily laden with the rich perfumes
                  of forest trees and wild flowers blooming on a thousand hills, and all the saloons
                  in town were closed, except those which confined their sales to a certain Teutonic
                  beverage, too numerous to mention, I became country-struck. I was seized with an
                  itching desire to revel in glossy bowers amid the cool foliage of the new-born
                  summer; to breathe uninterruptedly the clear, fresh and invigorating atmosphere of
                  rural regions, for a day at least, and perchance forever. My board bill for the
                  week ending upon that day, it pains me to state, was unsettled.</p>
               <p>Full of a noble resolution, I applied to a hackman, one of those popular
                  encyclopedias of municipal knowledge so utterly indispensable to every well
                  regulated city, and asked him if he could direct me to some suburban retreat where
                  I could spend half an hour quietly, and without being intruded upon. I knew that
                  the hackman would tell me truly. Hackmen are, in one sense of the word, nature's
                  noblemen. Their word is their bond. Hackmen, Philadelphia dispatches, and the
                  local columns of Chicago newspapers, never lie. It is not to be marveled at,
                  therefore, that I was a little surprised when the bright, particular hackman to
                  whom I applied turned abruptly to six, eight or a dozen stout, healthy,
                  good-natured, muscular companions, and roared at the top of his voice (which was
                  the roof of his mouth): "Come on, cubs, here's a go. Here's a chap wants to know
                  were he can treat to the Bourbon, and spend half a dollar without being intruded
                  upon. It was in vain that I protested, and declared that I had never said any such
                  thing. I was surrounded by the multitude of hackmen, who greeted me with rapturous
                  delight, and conducted me, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vi et armis,</foreign> up
                  seventeen flights of a filthy alley, to one of those establishments without the
                  existence of which John B. Gough might never have been half the man he is, and
                  there I was commanded to "shell out," as if I had been a hazel nut or a dried
                  bean. I shelt. To save argument, and for the benefit of my health, which I was
                  afraid might be seriously impaired if I declined, as several of the company
                  appeared to be considerably "on the muss," I treated. Subsequently, I sought in
                  the most tender terms imaginable, the information I desired, from the chief of the
                  miscellaneous assemblage in which I found myself. Said chief was in stature about
                  half-past six, with a very expressive pork-house countenance and kaleidoscopic
                  nose, head like a cocoa-nut, and hair about eighteen "carrots" fine—or
                  coarse—which is all the same. This remarkable individual proceeded to inform me,
                  in a manner the clearness of which would have reflected credit upon the renowned
                  Jack Bunsby, or any other man, "that there were lots of places where a feller
                  could see lots of fun, and there were lots of places where a feller couldn't see
                  so much fun, and there were other places where there was lots going on, but not
                  much fun." He therefore advised me, if I wanted to see lots of fun, to go to one
                  of these places. I started at once, without ever pausing to take the number of his
                  lots. Eager to escape the attentions of my too accommodating companions, I
                  "sloped;" my coat-tails twinkled in the horizon of pig alley, and I evanished<pb
                     n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5851-00000103"/> ished amid the peripatetic panorama of
                  human life that pervaded one of our principal thoroughfares.</p>
               <p>St. Louis, I find, is characterized by one delicious peculiarity. Although the
                  vending of ardent spirits on the Sabbath day is prohibited by law, lager beer,
                  which, with "Switzer kase" and "pretzels," constitute the German diet, is retailed
                  or wholesaled in quantities to suit purchasers, at all hours, day and night. And
                  why not? It has been enacted by a legislative assembly that lager beer is not an
                  intoxicating drink; and, therefore, if a man become "salubrious" by imbibing too
                  freely the precious compound, he can easily prove the illegality of the
                  intoxication. I have heard it stated that this favoritism for the Germanic drink
                  over brandy and whiskey, arises from a preference in this country for German
                  institutions as against the French, and that it is a facetious way the Americans
                  have of setting up Gambrinis against the house of <emph>Bourbon</emph>. This,
                  however, as the specials say, needs confirmation.</p>
               <p>Not perceiving the means readily at hand of satisfying my desire to visit the
                  rural precincts, I strolled into a sub-terranean cavern, where lager beer is
                  retailed at five cents a glass by corpulent cherubs of the tender sex, with red
                  circingles around their waists, and dollar jewelry in their ears. It has often
                  struck me that a barrel of beer would be a capital thing to use for a drum in the
                  recruiting service. It is astonishing how able-bodied young men rally at the tap.
                  The particular underground establishment which I visited on this occasion
                  possessed unwonted attractions in the persons of the adipose cherubs
                  aforementioned. Young ladies reared in a basement (<emph>abasement?</emph>) are
                  like potato vines sprouted in a cellar—they are just more than soft. They are
                  especially sweet on strangers. When I had taken a seat near the rim of a circular
                  table, which seemed to have been provided for the accommodation of visitors, the
                  dear creatures clustered around me, and several of the more fascinating ones came
                  in such dangerous proximity to my distinguished person that I began to feel like a
                  villain. There was music and dancing in an adjacent apartment, and being myself
                  rather of a Terpsichorean turn of mind, I politely invited a rare and radiant
                  creature whose mellifluous voice was slightly embellished with the exquisite
                  accent of the Fatherland, to join me in a waltz. She smiled—positively smiled—and
                  her large, lustrous eyes seemed melting with love and tenderness as she replied:
                  "I don't like to waltz; it always makes me sick."</p>
               <p>It <choice>
                     <sic>it</sic>
                     <corr>is</corr>
                  </choice> needless to say that my coat-tails twinkled again. I sped like an arrow
                  through streets and through courts, and never paused till I stood on an
                  uninhabited arpen of free American soil, where I could breathe the pure ozone,
                  from the great prairies, and where I felt in nowise elated with my discovery of a
                  new-fangled emetic. I mused a while upon the course I had better adopt for the
                  killing of the remainder of the day, and while musing, a street car came that way.
                  Instantaneously my mind was made up. I leaped aboard, full of a noble resolution
                  to "do" the parks in the suburbs. In the car I recognized Mr. Simkins, and Mrs.
                  Simkins, and the three little Simkinses. Simkins is a counter-jumper, or tapeworm,
                  on a salary of a thousand a year, and<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5851-00000104"/>
                  Mrs. Simkins was fairly buried in billows of lace, with waterfall, flounces and
                  furbelows of oriental magnificence. I felt flattered upon finding myself
                  surrounded by such aristocratic company. Scarcely had I found time to congratulate
                  myself, however, when my equanimity was upset by a troublesome sensation of the
                  cuticle—a sense of something crawling, and leaping, and hopping, and skipping, and
                  going through most of the performances mentioned by Southey, in his description of
                  how the water comes down at Lodore. I will not say I scratched, for that would
                  have been highly improper in polite society, but I certainly did perform some very
                  strange pantomime, consisting chiefly of a twitching of the muscles, and rubbing
                  of the vertebral column against the side of the car. At first this necessary
                  procedure annoyed me exceedingly, for fear the other inmates of the vehicle might
                  have grave apprehensions concerning the state of my health, but pretty soon I
                  discovered that Mr. Simkins was afflicted in the same way as myself; so, also, the
                  little Simkinses; and even the Mrs. Simkins was occasionally constrained to thrust
                  her fingernails into her sides doggedly. I was alarmed; the situation was becoming
                  more and more exciting. Mr. Simkins turned to Mrs. Simkins and murmured, <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce</foreign>, "I wonder what the devil has got into me?"
                  I wondered what the devil had got <emph>on to</emph> me. Mrs. Simkins said never a
                  word, but she looked around to see that nobody was watching, and then made a dive
                  for something, which she didn't get. At last, all doubts as to the cutaneous
                  irritation of the party were set permanently at rest by an infinitesimal Simkins,
                  who, in a reconnoitering expedition dition up his trousers legs, captured a
                  prisoner, and thereupon shrieked in a voice sixteen octaves higher than juveniles
                  of his age are generally supposed capable of reaching, "FLEAS, BY THUNDER!" He was
                  right.</p>
               <p>When I was a boy, my father used to warn me against bad company, with a very
                  homely but wise illustration, to the effect that, if a man lies down with dogs, he
                  may expect to got up with fleas. I was unable to detect traces of cur, terrier or
                  spaniel in the car I occupied; but with my father's proverb running confusedly
                  through my mind, and impressing me with the fact that dogs engender fleas, I could
                  hardly avoid the conclusion that a majority of the human race are rapidly
                  degenerating into the canine branch of the animal kingdom. Either this is the
                  case, or the combined effects of the heated term and over-crowded street cars, are
                  more potent in the production of pestilential vermin than even the most prolific
                  of the dog creation.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the park, Mr. Simkins struck a "beeline" for a secluded bower, where he
                  could gather fleas in quiet. I think he moved more briskly than was his custom.
                  Mrs. Simkins' skirt tilted as it never tilted before, owing, no doubt, to the
                  light infantry drill of the fleas thereon, and the little Simkinises actually
                  turned somersaults over each other's beads in their great haste to reach the
                  brush. To Mr. Simkins and his interesting progeny, the catching of the mischievous
                  little animals was a harassing and up-hill business, while Mrs. S. succeeded
                  wonderfully well. A woman for flea-catching, although she can't sharpen a pencil
                  or thrown a stone.<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5851-00000105"/> Mrs. S. would guard
                  warily until her eye lit upon the insect; then, wetting her fingers, she would
                  approach cautiously until within an inch or so of the creature, and then, zip! she
                  had him. The women are your true flea-catchers.</p>
               <p>As for myself, I have set my miseries to music after the manner of some verses
                  which I read in an Eastern paper upon a similar subject. I think the original was
                  translated from the Vulgate of A. Silliman:</p>

                  the street cars, by all means. Do not be surprised if the conductors do not bestow
                  upon you that attention which you think you deserve. They expect passengers to
                  scratch for themselves. My impression is, that I shall remain at home the present
                  Sabbath, and content myself with thinking of the beauties of suburban scenery.</p>

               <head>INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE.</head>
               <p>In company with several other undistinguished persons hereinafter to be described,
                  I have been among the Northwestern Fair considerably during the last hundred and
                  twenty-five hours, and I want to open my heart and pour out its contents through
                  the columns of your paper.</p>
               <p>So here goes for the benefit of the pour.</p>
               <p>I want to tell you how much I have suffered in behalf of our once distracted but
                  now happy country; how like a giant I have battled with—but I guess that's as much
                  as you can stand in that strain. I'll tell it in a different style.</p>
               <p>You remember the great opening day of the Northwestern Fair (doubtless) when the
                  procession variously estimated from five thousand people up to four miles in
                  length, tramped through the streets to the serious detriment of independent
                  pedestrianism. I had invitations to join several distinguished bodies in the
                  procession. I had a letter from the board of aldermen, also from the board of
                  trade, from the board of supervisors, the board of managers, and gentlemen who
                  board for three dollars a week. I held back for a good offer. I have participated
                  in too many hired processions to turn out for nothing.<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000107"/> I received no offer commensurate with my abilities,
                  and I became a silent spectator. I have only time to enumerate a few of the most
                  noticeable features of the procession. There was a large wagon full of sewing
                  machines closely followed by at reaping machine, which circumstance, I think, was
                  intended to be a verification of that oft-quoted but unappreciated proverb, "as
                  you rip so shall ye sew." Another noticeable feature was a chariot with a little
                  buggy on it. The driver asked me to ride with him; said he had a buggy on, and
                  wanted a wag-on. Persons unable to see that jest can have their money refunded by
                  sending to my address.</p>
               <p>When the procession arrived at the court-house, Mr. B—— if I remember rightly, Mr.
                  Thomas B——, Mr. Thomas B. B——, got off a speech. Previous to taking the stand he
                  discovered me in the midst of the crowd, and I verily believe he mistook me for a
                  reporter; on account of my dress probably, or the cut of my hair—can't say which.
                  He came to me with an oratorial smile on his face, and said he hoped I wouldn't
                  publish his address. Told him I never did those things unless paid in advance—five
                  dollars for name and residence, one insertion. He said he didn't mean that; he
                  meant his speech. Then I mistrusted he wanted me to flatter him, so I told him he
                  need give himself no uneasiness; if I published his speech, I would publish it
                  verbatim. Hang me if he didn't stare at me like a maniac, and said that was just
                  what he was afraid of; he didn't want it published verbatim; he was trying to
                  build up a reputation here, and I ought not to crush him in his blossomhood, and
                  all that sort of stuff. I took him aside then, and spoke a few words of
                  consolation, which, like the vessels in the Southern navy, were only intended for
                  private ears, after which he looked better. He inserted his right hand in his
                  pantaloons pocket till the second joint of his middle finger was hid. I said
                  nothing. The hand moved a little further, and the ring was obscured. I said
                  nothing. The edge of his wristband went in. I said nothing. At the next motion his
                  sleeve buttons were engulphed, and I told him that would do. I could make his
                  oration a magnificent thing for that amount. He very quietly took from his pocket
                  an elegant pen-knife, and commenced trimming his nails. We parted, he and I,
                  abruptly, and I am prepared to say that no man can be an orator who can't go
                  sleeve-buttons deep, for the sake of having his speech made respectable.</p>
               <p>As the great oration closed a cannon was fired, which was the signal for the
                  opening of the fair. Then I felt glorious, and jumped up and jumped down again,
                  and asked the fellow why the Northwestern Fair was a big thing? Because it could
                  shoot a cannon. I rushed into a paper factory and indited a note to Sylphina
                  Brownee, asking her to accompany me to the Fair. Sylphina Brownee sent me a reply,
                  saying she accepted. She always accepts. Sylphina confidently expects at some
                  period or semi-colon of her life too future to enumerate, to become Mrs. Le
                  Connor. She told her mother so. She told her so to make her feel bad, one day,
                  when she had pulled nearly all of the lady's hair out of her head, in a highly
                  affectionate manner. I am excessively popular among the young Brownees, but the
                  old Brownees<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5851-00000108"/> are down on me, and can't
                  bear to hear my name mentioned. I went down to old Brownee's house and found
                  Sylphina in a flutter of excitement, preparing to fill her appointment. She was in
                  too big a hurry by half. After thinking the matter over calmly, when not under the
                  influence of cannon, I was in no haste at all. Sylphina had poured a bottle of
                  camphine on her best handkerchief, and cleaned her teeth with a shoe brush. She
                  was about to empty a cask of coal oil on her head and rub it in with a door mat,
                  but I entered just in time to prevent the catastrophe. I have been sorry since
                  that I didn't let her proceed; she would not have wanted to go to a fair for the
                  next twelve months.</p>
               <p>When Sylphina had made all the necessary arrangements, for her own outfit, she
                  astonished me suddenly by informing me that she thought her elder sister ought to
                  go; and her eldest sister must go by all means; and then she spoke of her
                  eldest-est sister, (you may put on as many <emph>ests</emph> as you want to; she
                  was seventy-six at least,) and said she knew I would be kind enough to take her.
                  When I had consented to take these three, Sylphina unexpectedly thought of her
                  younger sister who had just quit going to school, and had not been around much
                  yet; then there was her youngest sister, little Jane, who had never seen a Fair;
                  of course I must take her. Last of all came the baby, an abominable young one
                  about six months old. "Bless its little heart, it never gets to go anywhere,"
                  Sylphina said. She made me feel so sad that I could have wept if I hadn't known
                  that weeping was so infernally hard on the eyes.</p>
               <p>I consented to take everybody without a murmur, and we all started—seventeen and a
                  screamer—if my memory is correct. Sylphina took the young one in her own arms at
                  first, but as soon as we were out of the house she discovered that the ground was
                  muddy, and said she could not hold up her dress and carry baby, too. I offered to
                  hold up her dress, but the proposition was a failure. I had to carry the screamer,
                  after all, as I might have known before I started. Of all the young ones I ever
                  saw, that miserable little speck of creation took the lead. The muscles of its
                  dear little legs would have made a professional acrobat sick. They made me sick
                  when their possessor had kicked me in the stomach two or three times. Screamer
                  blubbered and kicked alternately. Did you ever see a fat baby blubber? I hope you
                  never did. The shirt bosom that I had on that day is now in the "relic" department
                  of the N. W. Fair. It's curiosity. Screamer had worms, I think, or young snakes.
                  He was cutting teeth, too, and his breath smelt like Greek fire, or some other
                  villainous compound. Besides he had a horrible habit of thrusting his hand into
                  his mouth, and applying it to my moustache. I might have borne all this resignedly
                  if he had not screamed loud enough to attract the attention of everybody in the
                  streets, and make me an object of ridicule. He was patriotic; he screamed till his
                  face was red, white and blue. His sisters called him "Little Georgie" every once
                  in a while. By Jupiter! Big Georgie never made more noise in the Southern
                  Confederacy than he did in my arms.</p>
               <p>I met an old acquaintance. I was in an awful<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000109"/> predicament—had the young one in my arms, two women
                  on each side of me, and the "young sisters" hanging to my coat tails. Said he:
                  "You ought to go to the Fair; it's a grand thing; you ought to go and take your
                  family." Only think that I should be mistaken for a family man—a man that never
                  had a family, or belonged to a family or had anything to do with a family. What a
                  horrid idea!</p>
               <p>We went to the Fair. We entered the hall—seventeen of us and Screamer—and I saw a
                  sign on the door that said, "Beware of pickpockets." I bewore! Seventy-Six was
                  terribly frightened, and tied all her postal currency in the corner of her
                  handkerchief. Screamer was scared too, I guess, for he gave an extra yell as he
                  went in at the door, that caused the band to cease playing for the space of a
                  minute.</p>
               <p>We took a general survey of the whole establishment—seventeen of us and Screamer.
                  Bought something for each of my flock—some chewing gum for Sylphina, and a yard of
                  red flannel for Seventy-Six to patch her winter garments with, and Chinese fans,
                  bead work, &amp;c., for the others. Finally we came to the wax department. The
                  lady who had it in charge was accomplished and accommodating. She wanted to show
                  us some little twins, she said, which she had made herself.</p>
               <p>Seventy-six fainted!</p>
               <p>Oh, what a faint was there! Right up, perpendicularly, to the height of six feet,
                  she jumped; then pointing her heels in the direction of the north star, and her
                  head to the direction of the Southern Confederacy, she landed broadside on the
                  floor. I rushed to her assistance, as was my duty under the circumstances stances.
                  I held on to Screamer's furbelows, and his head floated gracefully three inches
                  above the floor. With one hand I seized Seventy-Six by the hair of the head, and
                  held her till I blew my breath down her throat. Then I pounded her on the back and
                  on the head, and told her that our lady friend meant no harm by making twins for
                  the fair. But no signs of life were visible. Screamer screamed louder and louder.
                  Everybody screamed. I screamed. I was discouraged. I squared myself fairly, and
                  mustering all my strength, slung Screamer into a pile of woollen goods behind one
                  of the stands. Then I darted through the crowd and landed, I know not how, in the
                  street, with pieces of crinoline and fancy articles hanging all over me. I felt
                  for all the world like disabled gunboat.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Next morning the Judge of the Police Court sent for me. I went down and he
                  received me cordially. Said he had heard of the wonderful things I had
                  accomplished at Bryan Hall, and was proud of me. I was a promising young man, and
                  all that. Then he offered a toast: "Guilty, or not guilty." I responded in a brief
                  but eloquent speech, setting forth the importance of the occasion that had
                  summoned us together. After the usual ceremonies I loaned the city ten dollars.
                  Unless Richmond falls within the next twelve months, and thereby causes the
                  court-house bell to be broken, and makes it necessary to buy another, I am
                  satisfied I will recover the money.</p>

               <p>EDITOR OF REPUBLICAN:—An uncontrollable and quenchless desire to figure on
                  foolscap and in the public prints has induced me to seize and wield the
                  slaughtering pen once more. I love to write. It is a satisfaction, surely, to see
                  one's ideas marching out in single file upon clear white paper, sometimes bright
                  and cheerful, like troopers hastening to a dress parade, and again dull and
                  sluggish, as criminals moving to the whipping post, or children driven to their
                  morning lessons. The pleasure it affords me to note the manifold and multifarious
                  ramifications of a single idea now and then would, of itself, be sufficient to
                  reduce me to the condition of a confirmed quill-driver. Like John in the Isle of
                  Patmos, I can constantly imagine I can hear a spirit commanding me to "write!" I
                  hope you won't be so unkind as to inquire at this juncture if the same spirit has
                  ever commanded me to "publish!"</p>
               <p>I know you editors are the happiest dogs alive, who have nothing to do all day but
                  to sit and write and write and write. I was an editor myself once. So great was
                  the influence of my abilities among the patrons of the journal to which I was
                  attached that the subscription list went up in six weeks, (and I record this
                  circumstance without a single feeling of pride, and, I trust, without any
                  appearance of egotism,) in the short space of six weeks the subscription list, to
                  my certain knowledge,—went up!</p>
               <p>But enough on that head. The story of my past triumphs is too well known to
                  require narration at the present time.</p>
               <p>I am spending a few days at my suburban home, called, in a spirit of gentle
                  facetiousness, Bliss-Hovel, because there are no women in it. Whether it is
                  blissful, or whether it is a hovel, because of the absence of the divine
                  creatures, I leave to the inference of the intelligent reader. Of one thing,
                  however, I am certain; in the quiet seclusion of this delightful retreat, my
                  philosophic musings and meditations are uninterrupted, and I assure you that a
                  little quiet now and then is relished by one of the wisest of men. I need not tell
                  the young folks (for they will hardly believe me), that I am in the sere, and
                  yellow leaf, for there is little in my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">personnel</foreign>
                  to insinuate the fact, saving, perhaps, my aldermanic corpulency, arising from a
                  good constitution, good living, and a good disposition. For years I have been the
                  counterpart of the "too susceptible Tupman," of Pickwickian renown, and gradually
                  my diaphragm has expanded beneath a collossal waistcoat until the magnificent seal
                  of my imperial fob-chain has taken total leave of my visual organs, and is now
                  displayed solely for the benefit of others. But notwithstanding my circumference,
                  and the attendant fact that my hair has become silvered in the service of causes
                  which it has been my only ambition<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5851-00000111"/>
                  through life to promote, there are times yet when I feel a return of all the ardor
                  of my youth, and my blood leaps and hisses like lava pouring from the volcano's
                  mouth, or hot grease fizzing on a wet griddle. A brace of black eyes and a dimpled
                  chin are as potent as ever in their influence over my sensibilities, and very
                  frequently of late they have knocked my equanimity into a continental hat. Despite
                  my years, now approaching fifty, I can still lay my hand upon a young girl's head
                  (if she'll let me) and bless her with all the ardor and fervency of a young man of
                  twenty. That's so.</p>
               <p>But I have been digressing. It was my purpose at the outset to inform you of the
                  catastrophe which has driven me from the strife of the municipality to the
                  sequestered bowers of Bliss-Hovel. One of the events which has recently recalled
                  all the animation and vivacity of my boyhood's sunny hours, was the brilliant
                  flirtation of our corporation with the sister city of Cincinnati. I was in with
                  it. When alderman meets alderman, there is going to be something good to eat and
                  drink, and it was by no means a difficult task to decoy me from my seclusion on
                  this great occasion. I was invited to attend the festivities during the stay of
                  our visitors, and I complied. I must say that I was very well satisfied with the
                  guests and the festivities, and the etcetera and so on, but I do think the
                  representatives of the great rival marts piled it on a little too thick in their
                  praises of each other's virtues. Soft soap is a good thing in its way, but
                  Cincinnati and St. Louis should bear in mind that this very necessary staple of
                  domestic consumption is neither the chief export nor import of either city. I
                  rather like their style of mutual admiration however; it is much better than
                  wrangling and petty jealousy, to which so many rival cities are proverbially
                  given.</p>
               <p>We had an excursion—us fellows did—and you ought to have heard the speeches we
                  made, and seen the champagne we imbibed. My goodness! but didn't we make the
                  Heidsick and Green Seal look sick? Oh, no! I guess not! They make wine in
                  Cincinnati, but when they want to drink it they must visit a place somewhat like
                  unto St. Louis, where the atmosphere is an appetizer to grape juice, and where the
                  eloquence of Mississippi river water, in behalf of anti-tee-total principles, is
                  felt and appreciated.</p>
               <p>I drank champagne every time anybody else did; not because I liked it, but because
                  it was the only beverage aboard the boat in which we were embarked. I am not used
                  to steamboating, and I soon became sea-sick; or, to be scrupulously correct,
                  river-sick. Champagne bottles began to multiply in my excited imagination, and my
                  optical organs became dilated to a fearful extent. Instead of about two hundred
                  and fifty Cincinnati guests, I could see a thousand. There were at least a dozen
                  Mayors with six champagne bottles in each hand. The river water suddenly assumed
                  the appearance of the most delicious vintage; and, oh, didn't I wish I had been a
                  fish. I began to grow sick. Boating didn't agree with me. Everybody grew sick. The
                  excursion was a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sic transit</foreign>. Champagne bottles
                  began to dance in the air, and my <foreign xml:lang="LAT">caput</foreign>
                     (<foreign xml:lang="LAT">vide</foreign> Andrew's Lat. Gram.) imitated the
                  example. Somebody went on the hurricane<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5851-00000112"/>
                  deck and made a speech, and we were all well pleased with the deck oration. The
                  speaker was on a mental strain all day long. Others went altogether on the euchre
                  dock. Euchre, by the way, is a game of cards, which you shouldn't play on a
                  steamboat, because the deck hands always hold the best hands—they hold the whole
                  deck. Twenty minutes later—sicker. Nearer to shore. Boat began to heave to. I
                  leaned over the gunwale and began to heave too. Heard another man making a speech.
                  He was a Dutch broker and spoke broken Dutch. He was from Cincinnati and went
                  heavy on St. Louis. Said St. Louis was the greatest pork market in the world,
                  because it exported so much pig iron. (Laughter) Said St. Louis contained the
                  sweetest girls in the universe, because they were Mo. lasses. (Tremendous
                  applause. Guffaws and old hats went up by the hundred.) St. Louis, he said, is
                  much larger than Cincinnati, because since a gnat eye is small St. Louis must be
                  larger. (A little boy grinned and I contributed visibly to the proportions of the
                  Mississippi. Cairo dispatch next day said: "River rising at this point.") The
                  speaker concluded by saying that St. Louis was like a drum without a head—it
                  couldn't be beat.</p>
               <p>Somebody replied in behalf of St. Louis. He said Cincinnati was celebrated above
                  all other cities under the sun for its wine and swine. (Much merriment.) In the
                  way of grapes and hogs it was without a parallel in this latitude. (A gentleman
                  was discovered in the act of adjusting a telescope to "see the point.") Cincinnati
                  stocks, he said, would always command a premium, because Cincinnati was always
                  above Par-(ducah.) Here the speaker was interrupted by tumultuous applause, in the
                  midst of which something was said about a stuffed club.</p>
               <p>I was called on for a speech myself, and I spoke. A particular friend of mine, who
                  consented to accompany the excursion merely because I went, said in two words,
                  "Hannparricklecorreryouareabrick, Makeaspeech." I wonder my oration did not appear
                  in the daily papers. I suppose, however, they were too much crowded with other
                  matters. I engaged a phonetic reporter to take the thing verbatim, and here it
                  is:</p>

                              reflection. It's more than sad. (Peanuts.) To think that these two
                              proud cities that sit in silent majesty upon the banks of two mighty

                              great commercial ports and our great commercial men must crumble to
                              the earth and come down with the dust, and that our great rivers and
                              our great orators must all dry up; it is terrible. (Applause and
                              apples.) At this stage of the proceedings a deck-hand, who had rushed
                              aloft to slake his thirst for classical information in my Helicon, was
                              so overcome by the power and pathos of my eloquence, that he fainted.
                              This of course created general consternation, in the midst of which I
                              concluded. Ladies and gentlemen, I continued, I do not set myself up
                              for a public speaker, and therefore, by your leave, I will "set" down.

                  of such affairs; and I hope my experience will not be taken as an indication of
                  the performances of the more prudent majority.</p>

               <head>BANDMANN AND BROKEN DUTCH.</head>
               <p>The following is an extract from a letter received by Daniel E. Bandmann, the
                  tragedian:</p>
               <p>* * * "I confess myself disappointed, and I think the public are. I have always
                  had a curiosity to hear a tragedian spout broken Dutch. I know of nothing more
                  interesting in the brief existence that we are permitted to enjoy among sublunary
                  things than broken Dutch, unless it be a broken Dutchman.</p>
               <p>"I saw your Narcisse. It's big. Perhaps I do Mr. Narcisse injustice when I place
                  him in the neuter gender. I think not. He professes to be a Frenchman. Now, I
                  maintain that a Frenchman, with as few literary attainments as he appears to
                  possess, would not be able to speak the English language correctly. He would
                  butcher it a little for luck, anyhow. It wouldn't be broken Dutch exactly, but it
                  would be broken French, which is just as good. Can you marvel that I, with others,
                  have felt some disappointment in not having a natural expectation gratified.</p>
               <p>"Shylock was a Jew, wasn't he? Was he a Dutch Jew? If so, he would naturally speak
                  broken Dutch, which, I am told, you do not, when representing that character. This
                  cannot be called truthful acting—not by a jug full. We have additional evidence
                  that Mr. Shylock spoke broken Dutch, because after his estates had been
                  confiscated he was a broken Dutchman. Hamlet was a Dutchman, nothing else under
                  heaven. Yet no one infers it from your representation. I had hoped when I saw it
                  announced that an Anglo-German actor was about to appear on the American stage,
                  that we should have these characters in pure, unadulterated broken Dutch, as they
                  should be. But I am mistaken.</p>
               <p>"I am a little astonished to find that you are a temperance man. How, in the name
                  of common sense, can you claim to be a German without drinking lager beer? The
                  idea is ridiculous. One would naturally suppose, too, that being so fond of
                  playing the Jew, you would also be fond of the ju-ice (Jewess) of the grape. In
                  almost every particular, with regard to your character and your characters, I have
                  been disappointed.</p>
               <p>"A lady remarked to me, on hearing you perform, that she thought your voice was
                  musical. I told her that being a Bandmann your voice could not be otherwise than
                  musical. I accept your thanks in advance for that favorable criticism.</p>
               <p>"In conclusion, I wash my hands of all actors who can't play in broken Dutch. Go
                  on and you may improve. Narcisse is immense. Cultivate him. Be untiring in your
                  efforts to arrive at perfection. Never flag in your exertions, <emph>nor
                     cease</emph>.</p>

               <head>A MOONLIGHT EXCURSION WITHOUT A MOON.</head>
               <p>I once stayed all night at a tavern in Mississippi, where the following notice was
                  posted conspicuously in the bar-room:</p>
               <p>"If you are murdered in this house, your clothing will be taken care of till
                  called for."</p>
               <p>I confess it was the unexampled generosity and benevolence of this notice that
                  induced me to stop. I knew that where such a spirit of self-sacrificing liberality
                  was manifested, the hospitality would be overwhelming. About midnight, however, I
                  was foolish enough to begin to fear that, in the event of my being murdered,
                  nobody would ever be kind enough to call for my wearing apparel, so I got up and
                  took my leave peaceably, without the precautionary measure of calling for my
                  bill.</p>
               <p>The grandeur and sublimity of character evinced by the Mississippi tavern-keeper
                  was never equalled, except by that of a famous "Furloughed Officer" whom I have
                  frequently mentioned heretofore, and who, but a few days ago, sent me an
                  invitation to join a moonlight excursion on the lake, stating in a delicate "P.
                  S." that if I bought tickets for six young ladies, I would be entitled to go
                  myself at the ordinary rate of fare. A double "P. S." that looked like the second
                  growth of a peacock's tail, intimated that by paying double fare going out, I
                  would be brought back for nothing. Magnanimous proposition! It would have required
                  an iron-clad heart and a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">lignum vitæ</foreign> gizard to
                  decline such an offer. I accepted.</p>
               <p>As time was short, I was sorely puzzled about the six young ladies, without whom I
                  was to be debarred the exquisite enjoyment of going at the ordinary rate of fare.
                  How in the name of common sense was I, a man of modest mien and more modest means,
                  to obtain the services of six feminine creatures? Had he included one more, I
                  could have taken the Seven Sisters. But I was not even allowed time to advertise
                  for young ladies to assist in the production of a spectacle. Number six is a bad
                  number. It's very bad to take on an excursion, or anywhere else. I got the young
                  ladies, though, by hiring canvassers and paying them a commission.</p>
               <p>Went on the boat at seven o'clock. The first thing that met my eyes was a dazzling
                  handbill with "reduced fare" printed in red ink. I learned what it meant when I
                  had been on board all night, and was unable to get even a sandwich to eat. Reduced
                  fare is a very good thing in its place, but it ought to be confined exclusively to
                  armies in the enemy's country. It was announced that the boat was bound for the
                  middle of the lake, and intermediate points. The only intermediate point was the
                  point of a sandbar, where we stopped for the brief space of three hours and a
                  half, to take water. Those who did not feel like taking water took Napoleon
                  whiskey, misnamed Old Bourbon.</p>
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5851-00000117"/>
               <p>When about eight miles from port a cloud appeared in the west, and it began to
                  thunder and lighten. I found that the beer barrels lightened in the same ratio
                  that the heavens did. Some man with more music in his soul than brains in his
                  head, (a copperhead or a "John Brown's body" man, I don't know which) had a fiddle
                  along, and somebody else likewise fit for treason, stratagem, and other vile
                  things, proposed a dance. One of the six, with a miniature gunboat on her head,
                  and a red circingle around her waist (they call it a scarf in Indianapolis),
                  grasped me by the arm and pulled me on the floor to dance a hornpipe called Old
                  Hundred, the only tune the fiddler knew. Somebody introduced me to somebody by the
                  name of Lilzale. He's a capital fellow, Lilzale is, if he don't wear a steel
                  collar. He is a cousin to Lager Beer, and is a great joker; makes people feel very
                  funny sometimes.</p>
               <p>The dance went on, and the boat began to dance. The rain rained, and the thunder
                  thundered, and the night got darker, apparently to convince the passengers that
                  moonlight excursions were not all moonshine. A young bride on board, who had been
                  married about a week, said it was a honey-moonlight excursion, and went on to
                  explain why the first lunar month of married life is called a honeymoon—"because
                  it's very sweet, and—because there's a man in it." The boat shook its sides with
                  laughter at the joke, but the passengers couldn't see it. Young bride felt bad
                  after the effort, and rushed into a state-room. The captain went to her and asked
                  if she would have a berth. "Have a birth? you monster—I'll show you how to insult
                  a sick woman;" whereupon she tried to call her husband, but her stomach failed
                  her. Lilzale told me to go in; chance for a row; defend the soft sex; and I
                  defended. I threw myself at the captain, and went through the cabin window into
                  the gangway, where about twenty of the soft sex we're leaning over the gunwale,
                  sympathizing deeply with the deep blue lake, to the tune of Old Hundred, which
                  never abated a single octave. I got up and commenced sympathizing myself, and felt
                  like kicking the fiddler for not praying faster. I couldn't keep time at all. The
                  captain told me to go in the hurricane deck, in the fresh air, and I would feel
                  better. Told him to bring his hurricane deck down and pass it round, and give his
                  fresh air to the fiddler; he needed one very much. He laughed, the captain did,
                  and I went below and had a long conversation with Lilzale. Somebody suffering from
                  humor in the blood, fired a conundrum at me: "Why is a man who marries a
                  hotel-keeper's daughter like a ship loaded with sugar?" I ran as fast as the
                  unsteady habits of the boat and Lilzale would let me, but the demon followed me,
                  and shouted at every jump: "Because he's got a sweet thing on board."</p>
               <p>Talk to a man in a starving condition about landlords' daughters and a sweet thing
                  on board. It was an instance of cruelty without a parallel. When the conundrum had
                  subsided, I undertook to get up, but the more I tried the more I didn't. The storm
                  had taken a new hold, and was "going for us" in a manner quite unworthy of
                  emulation. Started to crawl out at the door and met the pilot house coming down
                  the gangway, hotly pursued by a smokestack and bass drum. Collided with a young
                     lady<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5851-00000118"/> and made a mammoth cave in her
                  crinoline. Young lady said Fiddlededee. Told young lady my name was not Fiddle,
                  and I was no D.D., if I knew it. In the confused mass of men, women, thunder,
                  lightning, crushed bonnets and wet dresses, I saw a reporter taking notes on a
                  paper collar, and for his heroism and devotion to his profession, I promised him
                  an interest in my future welfare. Saw another hero amusing himself by beating his
                  head against a door, and singing this strain:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg type="quotation">
                     <l>The devil sought to injure me,</l>
                     <l>By cutting down my apyel tree;</l>
                     <l>He did not injure me at all,</l>

               <p>The song contains two hundred verses, but the remainder of it merely expresses the
                  chagrin and disappointment felt by his devilship on account of the failure of his
                  malicious designs.</p>
               <p>The passengers began to think of ordering their ascension robes when the reviving
                  odors from the Chicago river struck us. I never saw people spring to life, health
                  and activity as quickly as the demented passengers on that boat did under the
                  revivifying and refreshing influence of the delightful perfumes of the river. If I
                  have, at any time, prompted by some evil genius, said any hard things of Chicago
                  river, I retract. It has never been known to cause sea-sickness, and that's a
                  virtue. When I go for another excursion, I'll take the river.</p>

               <head>58,600.</head>
               <p>MR. EDITOR:—I used to be a firm believer in the infallibility of the maxim that
                  "figures wont lie;" but latterly I have witnessed so many deviations from this
                  proposition in the ordinary walks of life—have seen so many young ladies, for
                  instance, display fine figures manufactured out of cotton batting, bustles and
                  stays—that I have reluctantly arrived at the conclusion that figures
                     <emph>will</emph> lie. A very recent occurrence will, I think, sustain me in
                  this faith, to wit:</p>
               <p>For a number of years I have been possessed of a burning desire to become opulent
                  and eminent, and all that sort of thing. This may be regarded as a spirit of
                  selfishness, but I shall proceed to show that it is quite the contrary. Cities are
                  made prosperous, not by rich men, but by men who are ambitious to become rich. I
                  can name cities among the foremost on the continent that are indebted for vast
                  notoriety in the commercial world to a set of gamblers and adventurers who figure
                  in transactions involving millions of capital that never had any existence except
                  in their own fantastic imaginations. That's "biz"—that is. St. Louis could never
                  do anything like that. St. Louis always reminded me of a fat<pb n="238-239"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000120"/> Dutch boy, sitting in a pile of cold ashes grinding
                  sausage meat—slow but sure. But as the inimitable Mr. Ward would say, "comparisons
                  are ojus." I trust there is none who will question my sincerity when I say that
                  the only motive I had for wishing to become rich, was a desire to assist in
                  building up the great commercial centre of the American Union. I wanted to
                  confront Chouteau avenue and Lucas Place with a cool half million; and striking an
                  attitude similar to that of Ajax, when be defied the lightning—(he is incorrectly
                  supposed by many to have been drinking an inferior article of whiskey out of a
                  stone jug)—say to the town in words like these: "St. Louis—henceforth from date,
                  even unto death—to the welfare of your inhabitants I devote my talents; to your
                  commercial prosperity I dedicate my wealth, and to the foul appetites of your
                  mosquitoes I donate my precious blood. <emph>Domino!</emph>" There was no
                  selfishness in <emph>that</emph>.</p>
               <p>But how was all this to be done? Obviously there was but one way. It must be
                  accomplished by a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de main</foreign>. One night, after
                  I had gone to my retiracy, and was thinking over if I had not better purchase a
                  ticket in the Crosby Opera House Art Association, and astonish the world by
                  accumulating a fortune suddenly, I dropped off in a doze, when there appeared to
                  me in a vision a little, old, dried-up fairy, with a glass eye and a cork leg, but
                  merry withal, and on his head he wore a tin cap, on which was inscribed in flaming
                  figures the number <q>
                     <p>"58,601."</p>
                  </q> I was about to ask him if that was the number of his regiment, when I awoke,
                  and it seemed to me that the vision had been a very curious one. Pretty soon I
                  snoozed again, and dreamed that I was at a rat-fight. I thought I had a
                  black-and-tan, with a gold collar round his neck, on which was written,
                  "Fifty-eight thousand six hundred and <emph>one</emph>." I threw him into the pit
                  on a wager, and he slew 58,601 rats in just 58,601 seconds. A change came o'er the
                  spirit of my dream. I was monarch of an Elysium, and chief engineer of a haven of
                  eternal bliss. I was alone with a widow, who I thought was the most fascinating
                  creature the sun ever shown on. I did not see her face, but I heard her voice,
                  and, oh! how delicious. Plato, of whom it is assorted the honey-bees clustered on
                  his lips (tough story, though) was as beeswax to honey compared with this woman.
                  In a cool and glossy bower, 'mid deepest foliage, I proposed and she accepted me.
                  I inquired her age; she replied that she was fifty-eight thousand six hundred and
                  one years old, and I remember she got very indignant because I asked her if she
                  expected me to marry a woman old enough to be my grandmother. Another change, etc.
                  I am sued for a breach of promise, an officer comes to arrest me, and on his cap
                  is the number "58,601." He lays hold of my arm. I make an effort to knock him
                  down, and I awake. Next day, about noon, I may be seen at John Finn's stock mart,
                  inquiring of that gentleman if he has stable room for fifty-eight thousand six
                  hundred and one nightmares.</p>
               <p>But that dream annoys me. I am given to superstition at times, and the remarkable
                  coincidence of numbers begins to affright me. I consult astrologers<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000121"/> gers and spirit rappers, doctors and savans,
                  wizards and learned pundits, and they, every one of them, for a matriculation fee
                  varying from one to five dollars, tell me not to be afraid; I am going to be
                  blessed with most marvellous good luck, and to inherit a great fortune and become
                  famous, and I don't know what beside.</p>
               <p>After all this splendid parade of promises, what did I do but to post myself off
                  to the agent's and buy a ticket in Crosby's raffle. I bought 58,601, for the
                  sorcerers told me that was to be my lucky-number through life. Then came a week of
                  awful anxiety and suspense—days without food, and nights without sleep. I may
                  literally be said to have lived on opera house—I breathed an atmosphere of it, and
                  thought of nothing else. While others were surmising and speculating as to what
                  they would do with it (I was especially amused by one fellow, who avowed he would
                  buy a Newfoundland pup and a watch in the event of drawing it), I had my mind made
                  up fully, but said "nothing to nobody;" I flattered myself I would give some grand
                  entertainment for the benefit of my friends—possibly I would bring out the Black
                  Cook, or whatever it is, and charge nothing for seeing it, and many more grand
                  things I was sure to do.</p>
               <p>Finally, the night before the drawing arrived. I suppose there were about two
                  hundred thousand people in the United States feeling very much as little children
                  do the night before Christmas, when they hang up their stockings. I was one of
                  them. I retired early. The light was burning dimly in my chamber when I fell into
                  a gentle slumber. The little old fairy made his appearance again; but he was
                  changed wonderfully. Instead of the jolly, good-natured elf I had seen him before,
                  he was now a great ass. He wore the same tin cap, but the inscription this time
                  read "Fifty-eight thousand six hundred and <emph>lost!</emph>" I couldn't make
                  that out exactly. He crooked his finger and turned up his nose at me in a
                  shockingly insolent manner. I blazed away at him with my bootjack, and was aroused
                  by a crash, when I found that I had shivered a three hundred dollar mirror, and
                  there was no one in the room but myself; from which I naturally concluded that the
                  horrid-looking creature I had thrown at was nothing but a reflection of——Well, no
                  matter whom. Next day, the telegraph informed me that ticket 58,600 had drawn the
                  Opera House.</p>
               <p>Figures <emph>will</emph> lie.</p>
               <p>So also will dreams.</p>
               <p>Also sorcerers.</p>
               <p>Likewise fairies.</p>
               <p>But I see the point. That fairy was either a wag or else he was very illiterate.
                  That "<emph>one</emph>" was purposely or innocently misspelled; it should have
                  been "Fifty-eight thousand six hundred and <emph>won!</emph>" then would I be
                  worth half a million to-day, whereas I am not, and the returns are all in except
                  from two counties. As things stand, I figure up that my guardian angel, or the
                  spirit of my dreams, has euchered me out of a costly mirror and a $5 ticket. Thus
                  run the world.</p>
               <p>For Mr. A. H. Lee, the fortunate competitor in this great chance battle, I
                  scarcely know how to<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5851-00000122"/> express my
                  admiration. I have tuned up, however, and made an effort in the following

                     <l>For taking so much liberty.</l>
                     <l>Like you I squandered just a V,</l>
                     <l>In hopes that one day I would be</l>
                     <l>As rich as Crœsus was, and he</l>
                     <l>Possessed enough to fill the sea.</l>
                     <l>Right manfully I paid my fee,</l>
                     <l>(Would not accept a ticket free,)</l>
                     <l>And felt as full of joy and glee</l>
                     <l>As any tree-frog on a tree.</l>
                     <l>Now, what a wreck! Ah, wo is me,</l>
                     <l>Dead-broke, I know not where to flee;</l>
                     <l>My true-love, once so pleasant, she</l>
                     <l>No longer sweetly smiles on me,</l>
                     <l>Nor kindly asks me out to tea;</l>
                     <l>Without a cent to take a spree,</l>
                     <l>I'm very sad, indeed I be,</l>
                     <l>O, Mister Lee! O, Mister Lee!</l>
                     <l>When this you see, remember me,</l>

                     <l>A remnant of a great and mighty tribe</l>
                     <l>Was gathered in a wood, beside a stream</l>
                     <l>That watered many a fair and verdant vale</l>
                     <l>In its meanderings; to meditate</l>
                     <l>And act, with honest earnestness, upon</l>
                     <l>The wrongs and dire injustice that had come</l>
                     <l>From enemy in blood. Fierce, stalwart men;</l>
                     <l>But few in number, they had thither come</l>
                     <l>For deeds of vengeance that were planned against</l>
                     <l>An adversary, whose unlucky stars</l>
                     <l>Had made him theirs. The warriors, tried in skill,</l>
                     <l>And proud of many a hard-fought battle won</l>
                     <l>From weaker fragments of their native race.</l>
                     <l>And swearing now the trophies of their wars—</l>
                     <l>Rich jewels from the mine, and feathers rare</l>
                     <l>Wrought into strange fantastic ornaments,</l>
                     <l>Decking in vast profusion brow and bosom;</l>
                     <l>And curious gems, and precious stones, and furs;</l>
                     <l>Grand robes, plain but beautiful, and bearing</l>
                     <l>Implements of war; clubs; bows and arrows;</l>
                     <l>Weapons of rough, ingenious cast, and formed</l>
                     <l>By savage hands, without much aid from art;</l>

                     <l>With these, like phantoms, reared before their eyes</l>
                     <l>By the Great Spirit, that He might impress</l>
                     <l>Upon their minds that they were charged by Him</l>
                     <l>To do their bloody deeds; and with the memory</l>
                     <l>Of all their perils and adventures, and their love</l>
                     <l>Of glorious battle and the streaming blood;</l>
                     <l>(Beautiful to them;) all tempered by one trait,</l>
                     <l>Conspicuous found in every Indian tribe</l>
                     <l>Of the great wilderness, that makes them laugh</l>
                     <l>Most happily when they rejoice in power</l>
                     <l>Above the weak; which in th'enlightened world</l>
                     <l>Is scorned by valiant men as cowardice—</l>
                     <l>A term they never knew nor feared—yet roused</l>
                     <l>To desperate action by a sense of wrong,</l>
                     <l>They gloried and exulted as approached</l>
                     <l>Rapidly the hour when their charge must die.</l>
                     <l>Two cruel stones were ordered side by side</l>

                     <l>Motionless and silent. On either side</l>
                     <l>Of the red monarch was a beauteous maid,</l>
                     <l>Offspring of his flesh and blood. His daughters,</l>
                     <l>Whom he loved more than his own life, they were—</l>
                     <l>For though depraved by nature, born to hate;</l>
                     <l>Taught that patriotism is to kill or die,</l>
                     <l>And be insensible to sympathy,</l>
                     <l>E'en when 'twas most deserved and most desired;</l>
                     <l>Yet, as God's image, he was not deprived</l>
                     <l>Of all the feelings that belong to man,</l>
                     <l>And with a father's love he loved his daughters;</l>
                     <l>Whilst they, more dutiful than wiser ones,</l>
                     <l>Respected him and loved him in their hearts.</l>

                        </choice>, just blooming into life;</l>
                     <l>The one a tender girl of scarce ten summers,</l>
                     <l>And the other but a few years older.</l>
                     <l>The elder—Pocahontas—heavenly name!</l>
                     <l>Lovely in itself, but for her sake,</l>
                     <l>Perhaps, deemed lovelier than it might have been,</l>
                     <l>By people in our time that speak of her—</l>
                     <l>Stood near her father, the great Powhattan,</l>
                     <l>And with a searching look gazed on his face,</l>
                     <l>Then turned again, and on the captive looked.</l>
                     <l>Picture of Pity, and a queen beside,</l>
                     <l>She stood in dread suspense, and filled with awe,</l>
                     <l>Grieved at the coming of a sad event.</l>
                     <l>Her raven tresses in luxuriant folds</l>
                     <l>Fell carelessly about her neck, and stirred</l>
                     <l>But gently when the playful, straying breeze</l>
                     <l>Touched her soft cheek as with an angel's kiss;</l>
                     <l>Her liquid eyes, dark orbs of beauty, rolled</l>
                     <l>So meltingly imploring, that it seemed</l>
                     <l>Her pleasure could have called the stars from heaven;</l>
                     <l>And her form, so graceful and so perfect,</l>
                     <l>So like a fairy, that whene'er she moved</l>
                     <l>'Twas scarce perceived—and oh! her loveliness,</l>
                     <l>'Twas eloquence itself. The King's decree</l>
                     <l>Seemed firm and irrevocable as death.</l>
                     <l>He steadfast gazed, with air that said to all,</l>
                     <l>As much as words, the white man must not live.</l>
                     <l>The captive bowed his head; the chieftain raised</l>
                     <l>Aloft in air the blood athirsting club,</l>
                     <l>Whilst from his eyes in fearful flashes rolled</l>
                     <l>The burning anger that he could not speak;—</l>
                     <l>The winds were dumb, and time it seemed stood still;</l>
                     <l>None dared to breath; death hovered in the midst;</l>
                     <l>His chosen minister o'er the victim bent;</l>
                     <l>The dreadful weapon trembled in the air,—</l>
                     <l>Ha! does it lower? 'Tis forever——"Hold!"</l>
                     <l>One moment more, and Powhattan had swept</l>
                     <l>Into eternity his darling child;</l>
                     <l>His club fell harmless to the stony earth,</l>
                     <l>And from his massive, heavy chest, there burst</l>
                     <l>Spontaneous sighs that rent his very soul.</l>
                     <l>There lay his daughter, cherished and beloved,</l>
                     <l>Her small arms twined about the captive's neck,</l>
                     <l>While o'er his bosom streamed her long, black hair,</l>
                     <l>And to his burning cheek she pressed her own.</l>
                     <l>She wept till tears fell like the autumn rain;</l>
                     <l>For heaven had taught her how to weep and love.</l>
                     <l>The Indian monarch's icy heart was touched</l>
                     <l>By the earnest supplication, sweet voice,</l>
                     <l>And thrilling words of his beloved daughter.</l>
                     <l>'Twas done. The deed of mercy was complete.</l>
                     <l>The Indian girl had saved a human life.</l>

                     <l>In the cold house of death. Far down the river</l>
                     <l>That rushes to the broad wave, dark, dark and deep,</l>
                     <l>Upon the banks, with golden sunshine lit,</l>
                     <l>Where waving boughs and flowers of vernal bloom</l>
                     <l>Perpetual blow, and merry singing birds</l>
                     <l>Of gorgeous plumage fill the odorous air,</l>
                     <l>Methinks I see in happy day-dreams now,</l>
                     <l>A band of cherubim, with flowing robes</l>
                     <l>And smiling faces, gathering from the vales</l>
                     <l>And from the precipices, to make a wreath</l>
                     <l>To grace the brow of her whose name we love.</l>
                     <l>The jarring discord of the busy world</l>
                     <l>Assails our ears. Time's river bears us on—</l>
                     <l>And as the thunder of the cataract</l>
                     <l>Sounds nearer, louder, fiercer, we forget</l>
                     <l>The things that once we loved, to look ahead;</l>
                     <l>But the great Angel of the upper house</l>
                     <l>Guards well the portals, and from darkness plucks</l>
                     <l>The fairest, purest gems;—thus we may know</l>
                     <l>That still in glory sings our forest queen,</l>
                     <l>And unseen harps shall strike her praise forever.</l>

                  <head>OLD DREAMS AND NEW.</head>
                  <lg type="para">
                     <l rend="ti-1">There was a time when in my boyhood's dreams,</l>
                     <l>There mingled visions of the mighty world;</l>
                     <l>Then strange imaginations wooed my brain</l>
                     <l>With fickle flatteries. Ambition marked</l>
                     <l>High on the bright, emblazoned scroll of fame,</l>
                     <l>In adolescent light, immortal glory.</l>
                     <l>My spirit followed the unreal lights</l>
                     <l>Of earth, and air, and ocean: it could sweep</l>
                     <l>With airy swiftness through the multitude—</l>
                     <l>Or study stillness with the burning stars.</l>
                     <l>The foolish prating of the idle throng</l>
                     <l>In crowded thoroughfares; the parlor group;</l>
                     <l>The shouting populace; the carnival;</l>
                     <l>And great events, and glorifying hosts;</l>
                     <l>The wild, sequestered pleasure halls of Nature;</l>
                     <l>Or, happily, dismembered thoughts of heaven;</l>
                     <l>And pastime sports; all claimed respect from me.</l>
                     <l>Then all things to my mind seemed pure and good,</l>
                     <l>And all seemed made for high and holy uses.</l>
                     <l>And whom I loved, I feared; nor deemed I then,</l>
                     <l>That to be just is to be all men's slave.</l>
                     <l>The smiles of friends like sunbeams on me fell,</l>
                     <l>And words of cheer came like the summer shower</l>
                     <l>To scorching fields; and sentiments and tastes</l>
                     <l>Were seen, embraced or shunned, not understood.</l>
                     <l rend="ti-1">But oh, how changed! The fantasy has fled;</l>
                     <l>The real has usurped the fanciful,</l>
                     <l>And life grows tedious. 'Tis a toil to live,</l>
                     <l>And who, but to accommodate his friends,</l>
                     <l>Whose grief he would not move, would labor thus,</l>
                     <l>And drag amid so many weary years</l>
                     <l>This worthless trust of perishable clay?</l>
                     <l>My dreams are pleasant still, yet they are naught</l>
                     <l>But dreaming over what I once have passed.</l>
                     <l>As some lone traveller, who has clambered up</l>
                     <l>A high and hoary mountain, and sat down</l>
                     <l>To rest his weary limbs, still gazing back</l>
                     <l>Upon what he has left, so I have reached</l>
                     <l>The goal once fondly sought. On either side</l>
                     <l>The road leads downward; yet I love to look</l>
                     <l>Back through the faded past; for it doth seem</l>
                     <l>That at the farther end of that dim path,</l>
                     <l>Beams the bright light which once was burning here.</l>
                     <l>That light is happiness; upon the height</l>
                     <l>Of manhood it was sought; now, lo! it shines</l>
                     <l>In childhood's fairy hours. Oh, can it be,</l>
                     <l>That when the faltering step, and feeble voice,</l>
                     <l>And silver locks shall come, that beauteous light</l>
                     <l>Will be still further from me? Nay, say not</l>
                     <l>That life and it are fading; for I feel</l>
                     <l>That when I shall descend the other side,</l>
                     <l>And it goes out behind the mountain-top,</l>
                     <l>Another will spring up—imperishible;</l>
                     <l>Bright in the bosom of the Eternal One,</l>
                     <l>To make my pathway clear, and guide me on;</l>
                     <l>Still onward, through the vale and shade of Death,</l>
                     <l>And lead me safe to Him. God will it so!</l>

               <head>EGYPT.</head>
               <head type="sub">ABSTRACT OF A LECTURE DELIVERED AT THE ST. LOUIS POLYTECHNIC
                  INSTITUTE, APRIL 12, 1867.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>[As some of the journals in Southern Illinois have expressed the belief that
                     this Lecture was designed to malign their country, it may as well be started
                     that it was in itself a hoax. The subject announced was "Egypt," without any
                     explanation in the printed advertisements to lead to the conclusion that it
                     would refer to any other than the ancient region of that name. When, in the
                     second paragraph, the boundaries of Egypt were given, the audience began to
                     "see it," and expressed their approbation accordingly.]</p>
               </argument>
               <head>LECTURE.</head>
               <p>It is my aim and intention to make this lecture about as interesting and about as
                  instructive as lectures usually are. Most travelers have strange stories to tell
                  of what they have seen. So have I.</p>
               <p>I dislike to reflect upon the attainments of my audience, and I shall not do it.
                  You will pardon me, however, for asserting what is indisputably true, that in our
                  maturity we are liable to neglect and<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5851-00000142"/>
                  even forget the studies of our youth; and therefore it may be proper for me,
                  before proceeding to discuss the leading features of the country that forms the
                  subject of my remarks this evening, to refresh your memories with regard to its
                  geographical situation, to insure a thorough and correct understanding of what I
                  shall have to say. Egypt is that portion of the habitable globe—or, to be more
                  precise, that portion of habitable Illinois—bounded on the south by the Ohio
                  river, on the west by the Mississippi, on the east by the Wabash, and on the north
                  by the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. Three of these boundaries are the work of
                  nature; the other is the work of human nature. The country is situated entirely
                  within the intemperate zone, judging from the habits of the inhabitants. It has no
                  latitude and no longitude, and no need of any. Every well-regulated family keeps a
                  medical almanac, a clay pipe, and a dog, and they are deemed sufficient for all
                  purposes. The principal products are wheat, corn, and the other cereals, lawsuits,
                  street-fights, and Andrew Jackson men.</p>
               <p>I am not altogether settled in my own mind as to why this strip of earth is
                  denominated Egypt. Historians differ on this point. It cannot be on account of its
                  resemblance to ancient Egypt, for that is very slight. For instance, the ruins of
                  the regular original Egypt consisted of towers, and temples, and the like. The
                  ruins of Egypt in Illinois consist of young men between the ages of twenty and
                  twenty-five. If I had staid there another week, I would have been a ruin myself.
                  In old Egypt mummies abound. In our Egypt there is but one mummy, and he keeps a
                  hotel in Jonesboro. Our Egyptians cannot boast of famous pyramids, but they can
                  boast of raising the largest pumpkins and the most invincible mosquitoes in the
                  world. They have no Pompey's pillar, but they have a pompous John A. Logan, who
                  did service in the late war. On the whole, the origin of the pseudonym is very
                  doubtful, but I think it may be found in this circumstance, that in old times
                  people went down into Egypt to get corn; now-a-days <choice>
                     <sic>the</sic>
                     <corr>they</corr>
                  </choice> frequently go down into Egypt and get corned. We will accept this
                  explanation for the present, at least.</p>
               <p>Cairo is the chief city. It is a port of entry. The Ohio river enters it about
                  once at year, and sweeps away half the houses with all their contents. I was there
                  a week or two after a flood, and a respectable citizen told me I had come too late
                  to see Cairo. The best part of it was down about New Orleans. A gentleman who had
                  lived in Cairo for a number of years, bought a tract of land down in Arkansas, but
                  was not able to erect a residence upon it. He had a very handsome dwelling in
                  Cairo. One night, he went to bed wishing that house was on his farm in Arkansas.
                  Next morning he awoke and found it in the very spot he had wished it, whither it
                  had floated the night previous. I hesitated before giving a reply when I heard
                  this story, but the narrator said if I doubted it, he could show me the lot where
                  the dwellings had formerly stood. That was satisfactory, of course. There used to
                  be a theatre in Cairo—the Atheneum. Mr. N——, a gentleman residing among you at
                  present, was the manager. I lectured in the Atheneum. The water was three feet
                  deep on the<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5851-00000143"/> floor; it was raining, and
                  the roof leaked. I lectured to an overflowing house. One man swam two miles one
                  night to hear me. He has been compared with Byron and Leander who swam the
                  Hellespont. One of them swam for love, and the other for notoriety. This man swam
                  because he couldn't help it. It was swim or drown.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of this latitude do not differ materially from those two or three
                  degrees north or south. The ladies are varied and interspersed. The prevailing
                  style of hair is auburn. I saw some of the auburnest hair in Southern Illinois I
                  ever saw in my life. I hope no one will take it from these remarks that I am
                  opposed to auburn hair. On the contrary, I am very fond of it. I like it anywhere
                  in the world—that is, except in my butter. In that respect I am not proud of
                  it.</p>
               <p>There are many vestiges of antiquity remaining unimpaired by time or the forward
                  march of civilization. Chief among these are numerous little mounds, scattered
                  throughout the country, and supposed to be the last resting places of noble
                  savages—those mighty heroes of the forest, whose names have been immortalized in
                  song and the history of massacres. They were a glorious race once, but they dwell
                  in abject poverty and misery now. The white man has followed upon the scent of the
                  red man, until the red man hasn't got a red cent. He still lives on, however, and
                  by his unconquerable Injun-uity, succeeds in rendering our western border a most
                  expensive embroidery. In point of education, the savages of the present day are
                  far ahead of those of a century ago. It is a very recent discovery, and not yet
                  generally erally known, that every able-bodied Indian is a well red man.</p>
               <p>But of the mounds—or Indian graves, so-called, I never came upon one of them
                  without involuntarily uncovering my head in solemn reverence. Not long ago I went
                  duck-hunting with a friend down in Egypt, and as we were wending our way beside a
                  purling stream, not far from a railroad, we came in contact with a strange little
                  knoll. "The grave of an ancient chief," I said, and lifted my tile in awe. I then
                  quoted those celebrated lines from General Halleck:</p>

                  <lg type="quotation">

               <p>It was proposed that we dig down beneath the sod in the hope of discovering some
                  valuable relic of the great aborigine there reposing. We did so, and were taken
                  aback slightly, although we never said much about it, when we discovered that the
                  grave contained the remains of a mule, which had been run over and killed by the
                  cars on the Illinois Central Railroad. The company had concealed the animal there
                  that they might not have to pay for it. I never saw a dead mule before, and I bore
                  up under my disappointment very well.</p>
               <p>I became intimately acquainted with an old farmer in Egypt, who, in a trifle less
                  than ten years, had succeeded in clearing off nearly a whole acre of ground, and
                  was in very prosperous circumstances. I met him by accident one day. He was
                  sitting on<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5851-00000144"/> a log nursing his youngest
                  baby, while his wife was busily engaged in cutting cord-wood. After our
                  acquaintance had become mutual, he invited me to dine with him. He informed me
                  that he was going to have a roast bear for dinner; "not," said he, "not that I'm
                  pertickerly fond of ba'ar meat, but I allus like to show the superiority of man
                  over the brute creation; therefore, I like to eat ba'ar meat whenever I kin." I
                  dined with the old man, and we were very happy.</p>
               <p>The soil of Egypt is alluvial—some. The principal products, as I have said, are
                  Jackson Democrats, and street fights. There were thirteen fights in Metropolis one
                  day, in the space of half an hour. An old resident told me it was not a good day
                  for fighting either. "They don't fight much," said he, "till harvest's over; come
                  down after harvest, and you will have some fun. I'll warrant you won't be in town
                  twenty minutes till one side of your head is knocked off." I appreciated the
                  gentleman's hospitality, but I never found time to go.</p>
               <p>Egypt is a sort of aristocracy in its own way. In many respects it excels all
                  other countries in the world. The inhabitants of the river towns can exist longer
                  without water, notwithstanding they have the best water in the world, than any
                  other known people. The mosquitoes have bells on their toes, by reason of which
                  they are enabled to produce more delicious music than mosquitoes in common; the
                  frogs, in addition to having diamonds in their heads, are silver-throated, and
                  sing longer, louder, and sweeter than any other frogs I ever saw. Their concerts
                  certs generally open on the first of January, and if the season is middling, they
                  run till the 31st of December. Rats abound. No man ever went to Cairo without
                  seeing rats. It is proverbial, however, that some men see more than others, which
                  is only an illustration of the diversity of power there is in people's
                  eyesight.</p>
               <p>Darkness, in connection with Egypt, has been spoken of time out of mind. This
                  characteristic of the country dwells not altogether in fiction. I remember ones
                  passing through a deep thicket at noon of day. It was then dark enough for
                  twilight. A little way before me I discovered what I conceived to be a stump. At
                  first I was in doubt, as there were many legends in connection with the
                  neighborhood concerning men who had been murdered there, the appearance of their
                  ghosts, and so on. I drew a little nearer, however, and was more than ever
                  convinced that it was a stump. My hair stood upright, and my blood seemed freezing
                  in my veins. At length I summoned all my courage, and marched boldly up to the
                  horrible phantom. It was a stump.</p>
               <p>Educational matters have not been neglected. I was present one night at a Lyceum,
                  where the question for debate was: "Which is the mother of a chicken, the hen that
                  lays the egg, or the hen that hatches it?" A melancholy, studious,
                  Demosthenesian-looking young man deliberately arose to his feet and undertook to
                  prove that it was neither one, but another hen altogether. He succeeded beyond my
                  most sanguine expectations.</p>
               <p>["Here," says a reporter for a newspaper, "the<pb n="288-289"
                     xml:id="VAC5851-00000145"/> lecturer began to retract piece-meal all that he
                  had said about Egypt. In attempting to follow his review of his own observations,
                  we became so enraptured by the glowing light in which Egypt was presented, that we
                  lost sight of our notes altogether. Further remark is therefore reserved for
                  another occasion."]</p>
