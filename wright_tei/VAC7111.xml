Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1868, by&#xD;
OLIVE LOGAN,&#xD;
in the Clerk's Ofice of the District Court of the United. States for the Southern&#xD;
District of New-York.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tim drowsy afternoon of a sunny autumn&#xD;
day, which had found its way into the Christ-&#xD;
mas week of December by mistake.&#xD;
In a quiet house at Number Seventeen,&#xD;
One Thousandth street, iarlynburg, (a sub-&#xD;
urb of New-York,) the drowsy afternoon&#xD;
crept past before the eves of a benign-look-&#xD;
ing middle-aged lady, in spectacles, and with&#xD;
her needlework before her;&#xD;
Mrs. Gentry.&#xD;
The pussy-cat dozed in the corner, the ca-&#xD;
nary slept on its perch, and the dog lay basking&#xD;
in the broad path of sun upon the yellow&#xD;
carpet.&#xD;
Mrs. Gentry's needlework slipped silently&#xD;
to the floor, her eyes closed, and she slept.&#xD;
And -the brawny Ellen snored in accordance&#xD;
mnthe kitchen; and the clock ticked drowsily&#xD;
on the whitewashed wall; and all was som-&#xD;
nolence and silence.&#xD;
Mr. Gentry, tapping away with his little&#xD;
hammer at his little watch-springs and trin-&#xD;
kets of tiny brass, with his crutches erect&#xD;
against the work-bench gravely looking on,&#xD;
in the little back-room up-stairs, was hardly&#xD;
noisier than the clock.&#xD;
There came a click, as of a key turning in&#xD;
a lock, followed immediately by the signal&#xD;
lang ! of a heavy street-door.  The Prince&#xD;
had arrived to blow the bugle-horn and wake&#xD;
the inmates of the enchanted castle. Mrs.&#xD;
Gentry started to her feet ; the pussy-cat&#xD;
mewed lustily, and the dog barked and wag-&#xD;
ged his tail with delight ; and the brawny&#xD;
Ellen ceased snoring, and smiled, and put the&#xD;
tea-kettle on. The canary jumped off its perch&#xD;
and chirped merrily, and the clock fell to&#xD;
ringing its five o'clock bell, and all was joy-&#xD;
&#xD;
ful noise and activity in the house - for Willie&#xD;
Gentry had come home.&#xD;
Ile was a noble-looking youth, with broad&#xD;
shoulders, well thrown back, and a head which&#xD;
lie carried with the ails of a king. His hair&#xD;
clustered in thick masses of soft, dark brown,&#xD;
much the same as his mother's had been he-&#xD;
fore time had increased the value of hers by&#xD;
showering silver there. His hazel eyes were&#xD;
playful and vivacious in expression.  The&#xD;
high, fine forehead was of a mat whiteness,&#xD;
equaled only by the brilliancy and purity of&#xD;
Parian marble; and the deep carmine lips re-&#xD;
minded one of some luscious tropical fruit,&#xD;
whose red ripeness is beautiful to the eye :anl&#xD;
staining to the touch.  his step was light&#xD;
and elastic as that of a young fawn, but in&#xD;
spite of this lie had not time to reach the little&#xD;
drawing-room before his mother had tripped&#xD;
out to meet hiiA, for her step was scarcely&#xD;
heavier than his own&#xD;
It was well the red lips did not stain-&#xD;
for if they had, in what condition would&#xD;
Mrs. -Gentry's cheeks and forehead have&#xD;
been&#xD;
" My darling boy !" she exclaimed. " My&#xD;
true young prince&#xD;
" Mother, you're a trump," said the Prince.&#xD;
Where's Pop ?"&#xD;
" O you dreadful child ! why will you call&#xD;
your father by that frightful title?  lie is in&#xD;
his snuggery.  But don't call him by that.&#xD;
horrid name, will you, dear?"&#xD;
"No, mother, I won't," he answered laugh.&#xD;
ingly ; " I won't, I'll call him Daddy. Where's&#xD;
Daddy ? Ah ! here lie cones I IIere's my an-&#xD;
cestor," as Mr. Gentry entered on his crutch-&#xD;
es. " Here's my Governor 1  My dear old&#xD;

&#xD;
Pop!   My rampaging old Pop ! My High&#xD;
Daddy!'&#xD;
"I knew you were home, my boy," said&#xD;
Mr. Gentry, seating himself, and laying his&#xD;
crutches on the floor within easy reach,&#xD;
"Something told me you had come. ~&#xD;
What was it told you, father ?" asked&#xD;
Will.&#xD;
"Never mind, my boy. But if by any&#xD;
chance you should think it was love, yoU&#xD;
Won't he far wrong."&#xD;
Will Gentry smoothed the few w hite hairs&#xD;
on his father's forehead, stooping over it&#xD;
fondly, and-again it was well that the red&#xD;
lips did not stain.&#xD;
" Tea's ready," said the brawny Ellen,&#xD;
appearing at the door and laughing wildly&#xD;
in Will's face, for no earthly reason except&#xD;
that she was glad to see him.&#xD;
It was a true American tea. Tiere were&#xD;
slap-jacks, and pie, and molasses, and cake,&#xD;
and tea, and yellow cream, and apple-sauce.&#xD;
And plenty of every thing&#xD;
Pop." said Will-and it Li sad to know&#xD;
that ie spoke with his mouth full-"Pop, I&#xD;
believe I'm getting quite dissipated."&#xD;
Mrs. Gentry looked up in alarm,&#xD;
"Don't frighten your mother, Will," said&#xD;
his father ; "explain yourself."&#xD;
Out till twelve o'clock last night at 31r.&#xD;
Pearson's Christmas dinner--''&#xD;
Oh ! interrupted Mrs. Gentry, " eh/ is&#xD;
not dissipation-to go to a tristnas dinnter&#xD;
at your employer's house-and very proud I&#xD;
ant of his ligh appreciation of you, tny dear.&#xD;
It is not every New-York merehaut would in-&#xD;
vite leis book-keeper to a dinner at his house&#xD;
in Fifth avenue. If that is all you mean by&#xD;
dissipation, I am quite proud of it."&#xD;
But that is not all."&#xD;
"Don't frighten me~c, Willie,"1 pleaded the&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
"Don't frighten us, my son," said Mr.&#xD;
Gentry.  "11onor your father and humor&#xD;
&#xD;
your mother, that your days may be long in&#xD;
the land."&#xD;
You won't let a fellow talk," said the&#xD;
young nan. " All I mean to say is this-I&#xD;
am going out again to-ight."&#xD;
" Where '.&#xD;
" Ah ! that's the secret.  I give it you in&#xD;
a thousand to guess what I have got on the&#xD;
tapis for to-night."&#xD;
"Tpis, dear," repeated Mrs. Gentry, cor-&#xD;
recting the boy's pronunciation of the French&#xD;
word.&#xD;
"Well, tappy then,mother. Pop, what do&#xD;
you think I've got on the tappy for to-night?"&#xD;
-'I couldn't say, my boy. I couldn't pos-&#xD;
sibly say," replied the elder Gentry, rather&#xD;
regretfully, as though it were a matter for&#xD;
lamentt that be could not divine his son's&#xD;
thottghts.&#xD;
Well,my new dissipation is, that we&#xD;
should all go to the theatre to-night.''&#xD;
"The theatre ! What theatre ?"&#xD;
Haven't you heard ?'There is a great&#xD;
moral (dratna to be given at Young Men's&#xD;
Hall to-night.  And as it's Saturday nih r,&#xD;
and we don't often get a chance to go to the&#xD;
theatre here in IIarlynburg, I move we all&#xD;
go. Shouldn't you like to go, mother.?''&#xD;
" Yes, dear, very-tmuch;" answered Mtrs.&#xD;
Gentry ; ''that is, if your father will go.''&#xD;
" Go !  es, inleed ! It's only three blocks&#xD;
ofl. I can      ttldislthat, e-ay ('nought.&#xD;
Ave are all such stay-at-homue blies that it&#xD;
will do us good to go out. And besides,&#xD;
Will, we tntmt have sotme public spirit, you&#xD;
know-we mr-St encourage home institutions&#xD;
-and help to establish the drama in Iarlyn-&#xD;
burg. There's a convincing argument--not&#xD;
that argument is needed. I am old enough&#xD;
to obey orders, ntd this rascal here is my&#xD;
superior officer"  And the old gentleman&#xD;
punched Will's ribs playfully with the end of&#xD;
his crutch.&#xD;

well found a mis-representative in the person&#xD;
of a dark, savage, ruffianly-looking man of&#xD;
past forty, who was in that highly salubrious&#xD;
state of crockery-ware known as "his cups."&#xD;
" Shall we go, Willie ?" asked Mrs. Gentry,&#xD;
so soon as the curtain fell.&#xD;
Wait for the allegory, mother. It won't&#xD;
be long, probably."&#xD;
The allegory consisted of a solitary female&#xD;
figure, standing alone in the centre of the&#xD;
stage, dressed in the traditional costume of&#xD;
goddesses, and holding in her hand a very&#xD;
large and very unwieldy flag 'and staff  A&#xD;
solitary female figure, with short white skirts&#xD;
and flesh-colored leggings, and an il-propor-&#xD;
tion t and worse-sewn liberty-cap poised un-&#xD;
steadily upon her heal. She was evileintly&#xD;
the original of the thmi little colored photo-&#xD;
graphic girl of the doorway dhsplay, whote&#xD;
form had been rounded by the maturing touch&#xD;
of womanhood, until it was now little short of&#xD;
a perfect model of perfect beauty; She hal&#xD;
long training golden locks, which himng inii n-&#xD;
tdilous waves almost to her knees, and h, &#xD;
childlike blue eyes, that looked straight ip to&#xD;
the clouds of heaven, seeminglyti, frott out&#xD;
their pure and liquid depths.&#xD;
A stage goddess-niervols, evidently, at her&#xD;
position, and the knowledge that the eyes of&#xD;
all present were turned upon her; ad w io&#xD;
experietced, doubtless, a great sense of relief&#xD;
when thit clrtaini fell, as it did soon, on her&#xD;
and the allegory.&#xD;
&#xD;
Two streets back of the street in wlich&#xD;
Young Men's Hall gracefully lifted its proud&#xD;
front, and kept it lifted-two streets back,was&#xD;
a third street, as different from its bustling&#xD;
neighbors which lay in close proximity as&#xD;
though they were further removed than Styx&#xD;
from Euphrates. A street so quiet and order-&#xD;
ly and deathly still, that the air which bore&#xD;
on it the noises of those neighboring streets&#xD;
seemed to hold its breath as it passed. A&#xD;
clean street,with clean sidewalks, clean, clerk-&#xD;
like men, clean, sempstress-like women, clean,&#xD;
school-going children, clean houses with&#xD;
&#xD;
"A very unpleasant spectacle," said Mrs.&#xD;
Gentry.&#xD;
If it was I very unpleasant spectacle, how&#xD;
dil it happen that Will Gentry arose, after&#xD;
the curtain had fallen, with a filmyiy mist before&#xD;
his eyes, and knew nothing until lie found&#xD;
himself walking vacantly along the street with&#xD;
his mother on his arni&#xD;
Arrived at home, lie received in silence his&#xD;
father's "God bless yoi, my hboy," and his&#xD;
mother's kiss, and sped up to his own apart-&#xD;
ment. He sat down silently, on the side of&#xD;
his spotless little bed, and meditated long.&#xD;
"I left this room three hours ago," lie sail,&#xD;
lifting his head at last, " a bov-  I return to&#xD;
it-a man. All the cares-all the pains-of&#xD;
a man who loves arc tuine. 0 mys goddess !"&#xD;
lie cried, stretching out his hands-" my&#xD;
-sweet, beautiful goddess, I love you, I love&#xD;
That night there was an aitdded name n the&#xD;
prayer which went up from    Will Gentry's&#xD;
bedside - and when at last lie composed him-&#xD;
self to sleep, lie dreamed that he was trant-&#xD;
formed into 'a glorious antiliue-a: youthful&#xD;
god of freedom; and that the beautiful godl-&#xD;
dess of freedom, (formerly attached to the&#xD;
great moral exhibition of the good Mr. Bag&#xD;
glethiorpe,) with her white arms twinled lov&#xD;
ingly about his neck, was seated on the hack&#xD;
of an ioutpreath Anerieanm eagh- which was&#xD;
slowly upwafting them both to paradise.&#xD;
&#xD;
freshly-scrubbed wooden step , and, midway&#xD;
of the block, a clean little church with three&#xD;
trees in front of it, clean also.&#xD;
Next door to the church there stood a&#xD;
house which had a history.&#xD;
Years ago, a gentleman doing business in&#xD;
New-York, and whose position in life was&#xD;
financially expressed by that ponderous ad-&#xD;
jective "opulent," had bought some "house.&#xD;
lots" in Ilarlynburg. For a length of time&#xD;
his "house-lots" had remained without other&#xD;
occupants than boys at noon-day playing at&#xD;
ball, girls at sunset trolling hoops, and honje-&#xD;
&#xD;
less nomadic animals at night seeking a spot&#xD;
of shelter and of sleep.&#xD;
nt there caine a change.   A house was&#xD;
built on one of the lots-a fiiie house, a large&#xD;
house, a suboirbailla, and the opulent gen-&#xD;
tlen canseoutand lived there with his&#xD;
opulent family , it they kept servants and&#xD;
a carriage , and trieids visited tieii; and&#xD;
altogether the sulburl) promised to become&#xD;
dinnied-jately fashionable, and landholders'&#xD;
were joyous at the prospect of future pros-&#xD;
perit, aid positively refused to sell at former&#xD;
p~riees.&#xD;
Then there aiie another change.  clouds s&#xD;
gathered on the sunny sky-the too -unniy&#xD;
sky. llurr11 ig mtessengers went alter the&#xD;
dtor - for die opulent wife of the opulent&#xD;
gentle an had been taken ill, and in a shorter&#xD;
space of time than you would think it p'ossi-&#xD;
Ide to die in, -lie died. And the opulent&#xD;
geulteuanhiusielf was down, and it was&#xD;
rumored that -lie also would ,die; atnd ntix&#xD;
opulent but thler bad-teumpered little gi-ls,&#xD;
oI-pringof the  aoxe, uiere hastily remottixed&#xD;
to sonio other llace-nio one knew exacth&#xD;

blue by turit", now yellow,nowy gha-tly white&#xD;
and thattt inoIe id-ays, wlen the sui was&#xD;
liinini brightly aiid every body else was com-&#xD;
plainiing of tie1 heat,'this strange opulent gen-i&#xD;
tenant would shiver and shak e as if w it d&#xD;
cold. And again, when the cold wind was&#xD;
blowing about the corners, taking all per&#xD;
sOIls w ral ptlt wx armily, antd stamp p their feet on&#xD;
the ground to keep life in thlem, this strange&#xD;
opileint gentleman w ould take oil'his hat and&#xD;
invite thie isid to blow on his temples, and&#xD;
supplicate the snOwilakes to melt on his&#xD;
burning brow aid cool it. And soon after,&#xD;
the opulent gentleman went away, leaving&#xD;
his house to let at a house agent's, for the&#xD;
lowest of " songs ; aiid the price of land&#xD;
went down to the zero of the speculator's&#xD;
thermometer ; for Ilarlynburg, poor Harlyn-&#xD;
burg, paria-like llarlynburg, was now known,&#xD;
and truthfully known, to be infested by that&#xD;
pest of pests, the fever and ague !&#xD;
But all this is now completely a thing ol&#xD;
the past. Valiant drainage stepped in, and&#xD;
&#xD;
friendly sewers laughed miasma to scorn.&#xD;
The hand of reform was soon at work, and&#xD;
at present, lIarlynburg is as healthy as any&#xD;
suburb of New-York. But somebody once&#xD;
gave a highly respectable dog a had name,&#xD;
and it interfered w ith every subsequent&#xD;
business operation of that unfortunate canine.&#xD;
And every body said there was fever and ague&#xD;
in lIarlynburg, and it militated against the&#xD;
house-agents, and kept rents low.&#xD;
And it was well for a certain Mrs. liapp&#xD;
that rents were low, as otherwise how could&#xD;
she have taken the great brick house-prop&#xD;
erty of the opulent gentleman--m the clean&#xD;
street iieet to the church, and opened it in&#xD;
rather an ostentatious manner, n\ itli a little&#xD;
tin sign nailed near the hell-pull, announleing&#xD;
that this was now MRS. Rari's FasIIONAiiii.&#xD;
BoxtaoiNsIlot si ?&#xD;
It caine to' pass, however, when, little by&#xD;
little the house tilled, that the appearance ot&#xD;
the guests at table was not snehi as to inspire&#xD;
any one,eVen Mis. Rapp lier-elf,wili lthe n iet&#xD;

house to itself, and did not seek to array it&#xD;
tell' unid,-r the presumoptuous tin signbolard&#xD;
at the Rapplm portal.&#xD;
And the good Mr. Ilagglethorpe, casting&#xD;
about for a haven of rest for himself mid lis&#xD;
faiivilx, deliberated for many minutes before&#xD;
daring to disturb the death like quiet of all&#xD;
about in the clean street, by a pull at the hell&#xD;
of the great brick house. Maiiy wre t'.-hesur&#xD;

were the qiuetion-, selfIdenianded, to which&#xD;
Mr. Bagglethorpe, in his love for truth, in-&#xD;
wardly, regretfully, answered in the negative.&#xD;
Was lie fashionable ? No. Ie was good&#xD;
lie was known far and wide as the good Mr.&#xD;
Jhagglcthorpe; but even his most devoted&#xD;
partisanl had never called him " fashionable."&#xD;
And, indeed, even if no other testimony were&#xD;
procurable, that queer, antediluvian  coat,&#xD;
those giant-like flappy trowsers, built probe&#xD;
bly in some remote day when cloth was as&#xD;
cheap as dirt, and a great deal cheaper than&#xD;
dirt is now in New-York ; that immensely&#xD;

&#xD;
Was Mrs. Bagglethorpe fashionable ? It&#xD;
is true she often personated fashionable cha-&#xD;
racters. The whole range of the drama,&#xD;
from Lady Macbeth down to' Roxalana, was&#xD;
open, and indeed had been penetrated by&#xD;
her.  And penetrated, Mr. Bagglethorpe&#xD;
thought, in a remarkably effective manner.&#xD;
Therefore, in one sense of the word, she wis&#xD;
fashionable.  A person who played Lady&#xD;
Macbeth-a queen, in fact-must be fash-&#xD;
ionable. But was that the style of fashion&#xD;
which Mrs. Rapp demanded ? And would a&#xD;
red cotton velvet robe, tritimed with tar-&#xD;
iiishel gold lace, he the proper fashionable&#xD;
costuie for Mrs. Rapp's boarding-house han-&#xD;
pIclts ?&#xD;
And Fifine-la petite ?  Alh! less thin&#xD;
either of the others, could ite lay claim to&#xD;
being a votary of the goddess of fashion, or,&#xD;
indeed, of any goddess whatever, except tiat&#xD;
very ill-cladone, that flag-hewrapped goddess,&#xD;
wlomt she nightly pcrsoiatel at the great&#xD;
moral exhibition. Little Fifine-a little, gol-&#xD;
den-haired, blue-eyed baby when this poor&#xD;
wandering couple had received her, with a&#xD;
blessing on them and her, from the arms of&#xD;
an unknown dying mother, departing this&#xD;
life as cheaply as possible at a miserable&#xD;
country inn, in some wretched village where&#xD;
the exhibition was then-even at that remote&#xD;
period-exhibiting with only qualified success.&#xD;
'They had taken the child and cared for her;&#xD;
and, by her own will, she had given then&#xD;
her poor aid in return. Sie was beautiful&#xD;
in form and feature, a model for the gods,&#xD;
if the gods had been sculptors; but in  a&#xD;
fashtiionalble sense, the good Mr. haggle-&#xD;
thorpe felt her deficiency as uitich as liis&#xD;
own.&#xD;
lie had concluded, then, that there was lit-&#xD;
tle o'r io isC in his applying at this forbidden&#xD;
source of fashion, Mrs. Rapp's boarding-&#xD;
house, when, by one of those strange acci-&#xD;
dents which, in various 'forms, sometimes&#xD;
govern the fate of nations themselves, the&#xD;
door opened, and a clean, tidy, but poorly-,&#xD;
clad woman issued forth with a basket on&#xD;
her arm, which seemed to indicate is tenden-&#xD;
ey toward that unfashionable but necessary&#xD;
place of resort-market. Seeing the good&#xD;
Mr. Bagglethorpe quite a fixture before her&#xD;
house, (she had been watching him from in-&#xD;
side for some minutes,) and feeling, in view&#xD;
&#xD;
of his rather shabby raiment, a natural anxi-&#xD;
ety for the safety of a coat and two hats&#xD;
which hung suspended just inside her door,&#xD;
she resolutely planted herself before him,&#xD;
and asked peremptorily:&#xD;
"What do you want?"&#xD;
"I want," answered the good Mr. Baggle-&#xD;
thorpe, rather astonished at her question,&#xD;
but determined to answer it truthfully, " I&#xD;
want a heap o' things. -In the first laceI&#xD;
want a fortin, and a noo dress for Feefy;&#xD;

what softened 1y the prospect of more lodg-&#xD;
crs, "yes, I-'have a few empty, thought only'&#xD;
a tew. Won't yout walk in, sir?  This way&#xD;
please," conducting the good Mr. Baggle-&#xD;
thorpe into a very large antd very barren&#xD;
parlor. ,"'IT:wo rery fashionable ladies, the&#xD;
Miss Millers, now staying at the Fifth Ave-&#xD;

Do you require all your female borders&#xD;

the good Mr, .agglethorpe, feeling that these&#xD;
wxere conditions with which Filine and Mrs.&#xD;
IRagglethiorpe could scarcely comply'.&#xD;
Oh I dear, nox; what ate you talking&#xD;
aount ?  I mean the Miss Millers -but, it&#xD;

them that they can't have them.  Will you&#xD;

ant in much haste to be settled with my&#xD;

would have preferred their being on the&#xD;

" It is tl least I can do, Gi:irdv, to try and&#xD;

he was the only father she had ever known.&#xD;
" My child, you are the darlingest girl that&#xD;

"No, dear. It means that although you&#xD;

with the kntnledge that she had now only&#xD;
about a quarter of an hour in which to pass&#xD;
through the various stages which lav between&#xD;
her present self and Quccnshiip, did not notice&#xD;
hiltm, or indeed any thing whatever, except that&#xD;
her good husband was a msonstrotus length of&#xD;
time in scraping his feet on the lower step.&#xD;
Will Gentry, gaming at the queer couple and&#xD;
smiling slightly, did not at first look at Fifine&#xD;
so that the girl had ample opportunity to silr-&#xD;
vey hint at her ease. She felt sure this young&#xD;
mian was not wicked ; that lie did not think&#xD;
ill of her for standing there nightly on her&#xD;
goddess-like throne to be stared at by the&#xD;
gaping crowd.   Ile'knew it was necessity.&#xD;
Do you not know it is necessity ? asked her&#xD;
warm young heart, eagerly yearning to com-&#xD;
mnune with his.&#xD;
He turned his eyes on her now-those soft&#xD;
&#xD;
brown eyes of which his mother was so proud.&#xD;
She had uttered no sound ; he uttered none.&#xD;
And vet her question was answered. He knew&#xD;
it was Iecessity  lie understood lier and her&#xD;
po ition -he respected her, he loved her ;&#xD;
wouldlhe give him her love in return ? And&#xD;
then and there she aid yes, and gave its, and&#xD;
still there was nothing uttered.&#xD;
All this oeeipied but a few seconds of time.&#xD;
'he good Mr. IBagglethorpe, still frowning at&#xD;

beloved by such a beautiful creature-o he&#xD;
said -but every tme he said it there was a&#xD;
tinerntal contradiction of his words.  But&#xD;
whether she loved him or not, one thing was&#xD;
certain, he loved her, ianl he must adopt&#xD;
some plani to forl her acquaintance. Younrg&#xD;

itiie, and thet he thought of   ifinr  iiand&#xD;
Will together ; and    then h e thoIglht he&#xD;

Will took the bull by the Iuhorns-the good&#xD;
Mr. Bagglethorple by the hands.  Ilis resolu&#xD;

delivery of his speech; and he began de-&#xD;
livering it accordingly, in a graceful attitude,&#xD;
with the thumb of his left hand inserted in&#xD;
the armhole of his waistcoat on that side,&#xD;
and his other hand waving serenely in the&#xD;
"It is a thankless spear of life, my aspirin',,&#xD;
young friend--a thankless spear ! Genus is&#xD;
rarely reco'nised. Look at Mis Bagglethorpe.&#xD;
Talent goes fer naught!    Look   at Lar&#xD;

have looked at her until I am crazy !)  Be-&#xD;
sides that, the art itself stands low. It hedn't&#xD;
orter. It is a grand art. A noble callin'&#xD;
As high in ev'ry way, ef not higher, than&#xD;
paintin' and sculptoorin' and Iakin' photy-&#xD;

limited intellergence of the general pubhi-~&#xD;
who is, ef you will pardon the expression, a&#xD;
mule-the limited intellergence of the genial&#xD;
public, I repeat, has put it lower than it orter&#xD;

Tread the boards at Young Men's Hall, in-&#xD;

walking a plank. What would his mother&#xD;
say to such an act as that ?-what his father ?&#xD;
-what all Iliarlynburg ?&#xD;
" Then wat T' said   Mr. Bagglethorpe&#xD;
sternly.&#xD;
" The truth is," stammered Will, hh ishi ng&#xD;
fearfully at his awkwardness in treading the&#xD;
devious paths of diplomacy, " what I wished&#xD;
just at present was, to-a-take a few les-&#xD;
sons in elocution and-a-that sort of thin,&#xD;
you know. I thought you would-that is,&#xD;

and--"&#xD;
I do not act,' said Mr. Iaggletlhorpe,&#xD;
interrupting, and leaning back in his chair&#xD;
Imajestically, "I manage.&#xD;
" Ye " returned Will, " I am aware of&#xD;
that. But perhaps-that is, I thought per-&#xD;
haps one of the- ladies of your f ainly, both&#xD;
so talented and beautiful," (and Willie, thmik-&#xD;
ing only of Fifine, laid great stress on the&#xD;
last word,) " night perhaps undertake, to in-&#xD;
struct me in this difficult art."&#xD;
Did you?" said Mr. Bagglethorpe stern-&#xD;
ly, all the more sternly because he felt his&#xD;
&#xD;
sympathies going out very strongly toward&#xD;
this good-looking young man, with his kind&#xD;
honest face. "Did you  '&#xD;
"Yes, sir; and believe me, sir, any re-&#xD;
muneration you might name I would cheer-&#xD;
fully give."  And now it was Will's turn to&#xD;
lean back- majestically in his chair, uttering&#xD;
this Rothsehildian speech.&#xD;
" I suppose I might speak to Mis Baggle-&#xD;
thorpe about it," said Mr. B. reflectively.&#xD;
-  Oh! do-! Please do! Speak to them&#xD;

" Ihnulet don't say that nowhere," ob.-&#xD;
served the mamniger'.&#xD;
rell, then, somebody    does, if he&#xD;

" You may bet on that,' conceded Mr.&#xD;
Bagglethorpe.&#xD;
''hen you will speak about it to the&#xD;
ladies-to Mrs. Baggletlhorpe, and to your-&#xD;

My ward ?"&#xD;
Yes, sir."&#xD;
"I'll see about it."&#xD;
"'T'hank  you," said  Will, with hearty&#xD;
gratitude i his tone.  " And when may 1&#xD;

' To-morrow, if you like."&#xD;
And the ladies will be here&#xD;
They'll see atiout it."&#xD;

the o1(1 man's hand until every trace of the&#xD;
original ill-feeling had disappeared, and the.&#xD;
warni old heart glowed to the core.&#xD;
("olod-by, sir; and thank you again and&#xD;

V  i GENTY manifested but little dramatic&#xD;

vored to instill into his mind the rudiments&#xD;
of the sacred art. All to no ppt'ilose! Il-e&#xD;
was cont' when lie should have been sad-&#xD;
lugubrious wlien lie should have been ga'.&#xD;
lie could not remember the text of' his&#xD;
author-lie could not forget the fact of Fi-&#xD;
fine's sitting opposite hi in lieu of an audi-&#xD;
ence. It is true the goddess said she thought&#xD;
he had hidii'rfiil talent; and so perhaps le&#xD;
had. lut the wonders of his talent were&#xD;
directed im other channels than  those of&#xD;
Thalia or Melpoimete. Thte wonders of his&#xD;
talent had tmanifested themselves principally&#xD;
in the art by which he had obtained a fiot-&#xD;
hold in the poor hiotie of the Thelspiaiis-the&#xD;
charmed irele where dwelt his beautiful&#xD;
go~ddess.&#xD;
his foothold was firmuu now-firimer perhaps&#xD;
than he lutiaginled, or hua'l at firet dart-i to&#xD;
hope lie could make it.&#xD;
At length the lessons were   abandoned.&#xD;

asked Will Gentry of the girl.&#xD;
"Well--yes." she answered    with sonic&#xD;
hesitation, " rather pretty. I think any other&#xD;
ptersot would enjoy it more than I.   The&#xD;
truth is, it makes te wretched to see all&#xD;

Will angrily.&#xD;

compliments poked at me-will you go with&#xD;
me to the skating carnival to-morrow night?&#xD;

&#xD;
Was it not like the scene in Romeo and&#xD;
Juliet?  The old nurse at the head of the&#xD;
stairs, and Romeo below with'his skates slung&#xD;
over his shoulder, and Juliet with her beauti-&#xD;
fl eyes bashfully bent down and shaded by&#xD;
the small rim of her jockey hat !&#xD;
"Well, you won't tell me," said Will, '" and&#xD;
I must go. I see quite well how it is."&#xD;
" How is it ?" she asked.&#xD;
"'You don't care for me, and you don't&#xD;
like to hurt my feelings by telling me so."&#xD;
Willie, I-I-" staimimered Filine.&#xD;
What, swecetlieart ? '1' what, Fify?'"&#xD;
1 (b love you so 'uive," and then cane&#xD;
the hot tears which she had kept restrained&#xD;
all the evening, but which would flow now.&#xD;
'' Dear little Fify !" he iurimured, in a low&#xD;
voice. "You have made mue so happy by&#xD;
this."&#xD;
" You don't think I am immodest to tell&#xD;
you so" she asked, blushing.&#xD;
Iminmiodest ?" he replied indignantly. " Not&#xD;
a bit of it. Immodest, indeed!"&#xD;
Somehow, in his enldeavor to Iprove ti her&#xD;
that lie did not think her iinnid-st, the&#xD;
jockey hat fell to the floor, and the -waving&#xD;
ringlets of 'the sun-tinged hair streamed over&#xD;
the collar of Willie's gray overcoat.&#xD;
" How much do you love miie ' lie asked.&#xD;
A lucid question, this. Very popular with&#xD;
infancy.&#xD;
''Oh ! more than I can tell."&#xD;
Not the proper answer by any means.&#xD;
" Three bushelss,' is the orthodox reply.&#xD;
"o miucl," she continued, in so Imw a voice&#xD;
that Will was obliged to bend down his check,&#xD;
till it almost touched her cherry lips, to catch&#xD;
her words--" so much, that to-night when&#xD;
that young lady skated up to us-the Turkish&#xD;
one, you knon--and said you had flirted with&#xD;
her at Mr. Pearson's dinner, I could scarcely&#xD;
keep from crying. And 0 Willie! when&#xD;
she said you had given her a pink Cupid-I&#xD;
thought-my--heart-would-break !"'&#xD;
Confound her !" said Willie indignantly.&#xD;
" Come, don't erv, Fify, don't ! You know I&#xD;
never can love any onebut you !"&#xD;
" Truly ?"&#xD;
"Truly " said Willie, touching her cheek&#xD;
with his lips. But she was scared at this, and&#xD;
moved away from him as though she were&#xD;
afraid. She need not have been afraid of&#xD;
Willie Gentry. The boy was as innocent as&#xD;
&#xD;
herself, and the love which burned in both&#xD;
their hearts was as pure as any earthly pas-&#xD;
sion can be.&#xD;
Will you always be true to nie ?" asked&#xD;
lie.&#xD;
" Always.'&#xD;
"And always love me&#xD;
" Always-always."   And again the bright&#xD;
locks streamed over the gray overcoat. 'Tlic&#xD;
were both too happy for words.&#xD;
Voice from up-stairs&#xD;
'iTie nurse agam.&#xD;
"ood-iiigit, darling ! said Willie.&#xD;
"c Good-night!"&#xD;
Pirtig nx1as sweet sorrow. They muiighit&#xD;
have said good-night until -thn moi row, but&#xD;
the nurse would not let them. She 'called&#xD;
"c I'/ ne !&#xD;
" Good-night, sweet love."&#xD;
food-niighlt, dear Willie."&#xD;
Did Romeo kiss Juliet?     1'erhaps not.&#xD;
ut Will ( entry did not trouble htimIself about&#xD;
precedent at that iioiienit of parting.&#xD;
Out in the street again, lie  alked over the&#xD;
crisp snow with the proud air of a victorious&#xD;
sovereign. Oh ! how happy Ie was! I.Iow&#xD;
dearly, devotedly lie loved her!  is 1eauti~&#xD;
fuil goddess! lie never could love another&#xD;
woman, lie said to himsel; never.  le would&#xD;
love her, and be true to her, man 1 -hie shulit tl&#xD;
be his owna darling--his 0n eet, sweet little&#xD;
baby -wife.&#xD;
Yes, lie would marry her at once. To~&#xD;
morrow or the next day, peraliills--or the&#xD;
next, iontli. le would limr herI as soon&#xD;
as possihle. Hm  happy he was&#xD;
le was not well-oi' yet, triue. But lie had&#xD;
his salary, and one more 1ersoi makes no&#xD;
difl'erence in a hounseliold, (a sweet and popu-&#xD;
lar lovers' error,) and ie would take his wife&#xD;
to live with his father antd moth er, and they&#xD;
xvould love her as they( lid him. How coult&#xD;
they help loving icie ! His beautiful goddes!&#xD;
Ilis sweet little Fifine !&#xD;
Perhaps he was reckoning without his host&#xD;
Who knows ?   But his own reckoning made&#xD;
him happy, and the host's reckoning had not&#xD;
yet been presented.&#xD;
Reckoning thus, lie walked lightly along&#xD;
over the snow, with his hands in his pockets&#xD;
and his shoulders thrown back, as was his&#xD;
&#xD;
wont, and the skate-steels jingling together  gayly-whistled and walked happier than an&#xD;
with a merry sound which reverberated on    emperor, for in his heart the bliss of first love&#xD;
the still night air. As he walked, lie whistled was swelling.&#xD;

&#xD;
IE put his key in the night-latch of the&#xD;
door of the house it No. 17 One Thousandtlh&#xD;
street, and entered softly.   le mist not&#xD;
wake his mother.&#xD;
lut to-iight, a - on one ot'ccas'ion before,&#xD;
his lrecaut:ons were needless.  As h passed&#xD;
the parlor door,I le saw that 1both hi aIrenlts&#xD;
were sill up, and     looking  nervous and&#xD;
anxious.  his father called limt im.&#xD;
"Willie,'- said Mr. Gentriy, " xou ar' out&#xD;
late again to-might."&#xD;
"Yes, father," replied the 1ov, "f-I-"&#xD;

" And what is to be the upshot of this love,&#xD;
Willie ?" inquired his mother.&#xD;
" The upshot,mother? Marriage,of course."&#xD;
" Oh ! of course," said MI's. Gentry, moving&#xD;
away from her son. " Marriage ! Upon my&#xD;
word, at what age will children marry next ."&#xD;
" I am past twenty, mother," urged the boy.&#xD;
You are in no position to marry yet,&#xD;
Willie," said his father; "your salary is too&#xD;
small."&#xD;
"It would be if the lady were a different&#xD;
sort of person. But O father! she is so&#xD;
good, and so modest, and content with so lit-&#xD;
tie, I'm sure you would love her dearly if you&#xD;
knew her."&#xD;
"Who is she?'&#xD;
"Yes, by the Way," echoed Mrs. Gentry,&#xD;
who is she ?"&#xD;
" Whv, you've seen her once. Oshite's so&#xD;
pretty and so good ! Dear other, you can't&#xD;
help loving her OWhen vou know her.&#xD;
" Who is she, I ask !"&#xD;
" Why, she is that beautiful creature we&#xD;
saw at Young Men's llall. You know the&#xD;
oe who stood on the pedestal-the Gsoldilss&#xD;
of Iiicrty."&#xD;
" An actress!'"&#xD;
A Ihiallet-d:meer !"&#xD;
lint, mother-"&#xD;
" Don't attempt to justiftv her, Willie ! I&#xD;
won't listen to it. I tell you you shall m/&#xD;
marry her. Alh ! I dare Lay nw you w ill tell&#xD;
me you are your own master, and w ill do as&#xD;
you like.  c Very well! I suppose a itotlers&#xD;
broken heart goes for nothing."  Anid 3r-.&#xD;
Gentry burst into tears.&#xD;
" Dear, dear mother,'' said Willie, kistsing&#xD;
her over and over again, "don't take on so-&#xD;
don't-don't, for iny sake."&#xD;
Why should I do any thing more for your&#xD;
sake ? This is what has kept you away front&#xD;
me-playing the gallaitt at the feet of a co-&#xD;
quette-an actress."&#xD;
" Mother," said Will in a low, angry voice,&#xD;
4 you mustn't cast a slur on her on account&#xD;
of her profession. It's as good and honora-&#xD;
ble a calling as any other, if it's only well and&#xD;
honorably followed."&#xD;
" And I suppose this young miss is highly&#xD;
honorable ?"&#xD;
" Yes, site is ; and if any man dares to say&#xD;
she is not, I-I'll knock him down for it."&#xD;
"Come, Willie." said his father, "let's&#xD;
&#xD;
PAcaj'LLTiIo1 P.&#xD;
&#xD;
have no more words abont it. Have you&#xD;
made up your mind to marry this person ?"&#xD;
" I have, father."-&#xD;
" Then you must choose between her love&#xD;
and mine," said Mrs. Gentry, rising to leave&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
"Won't you kiss me good-night, mother ?"&#xD;
asked the boy tenderly.&#xD;
Keep your kisses," she answered, " for&#xD;
-where, I dtare saye, they are to be had cheap&#xD;
enougih-on the blips of that girl.''&#xD;
Poor little Fifiie ! To think that sie should&#xD;
hie accused of givin her kisses cheap! She,&#xD;
off whose fre- young lips Willie's ow t11had&#xD;
bruslhed the first dew.&#xD;
After his mother was gone, Willie sat on&#xD;
the sofa anmd 1 iiehed his face in his hands.&#xD;
" This is a sad busine s," sdil tie father.&#xD;
"Father, mother is cruel to ime. She has&#xD;
tio ight spoken ill of the dearest girl that&#xD;
ever lived. My blood boiled while she was&#xD;
doing.so. If it had been any one but iy own&#xD;
mother 1-0 father, father ! how can m  y&#xD;
ittother he seo cruel ?  And now  it was&#xD;
W\illie's turn to break down, and cob.&#xD;
ili e is your mother, remember, Will,"&#xD;
said Mr. (Gentry gravely ; " and such a good&#xD;
imiotler she has beeni to you-so loving-so&#xD;
devote" .&#xD;
"I know it," said Willie, soling.&#xD;
It would be a sal thing for nme to see a&#xD;
breaking up1 in our little household, where we&#xD;
have all h    'en so happy.' 'lhre were tears&#xD;
im the eyes of the elder man now.&#xD;
" I ti 't anticipate for a moment any&#xD;
breaking up or divisioni" said Willie. raisin&#xD;
his head. " I thought we could all live here&#xD;
together happily and comfortably."&#xD;
".It appears it can not be."&#xD;
" 0 father what am I to do ?"&#xD;
'Willie, your first duty is to your mother.&#xD;
Think of her."&#xD;
" But 0 father 1" said the boy, grasping&#xD;
his father's hand, "I love my little girl so&#xD;
tiearly "&#xD;
Have you asked her to marry you yet ?"&#xD;
No ; but I have asked her to give me her&#xD;
love, and she has given it."&#xD;
" Well, then, my~ boy, I think you had bet-&#xD;
ter wait a bit before asking her to marry you.&#xD;
You see, my child, it is such a serious obliga-&#xD;
tion-marriage, I mean. Wait a bit, and test&#xD;
yourself. See whether this is true love, or&#xD;

" It would be the best thing you could&#xD;
possibly do itt 'every way, Willie,' continued&#xD;
the father.  " By that thime, I do not doubt&#xD;

and put them ii before her eves to catch&#xD;
the flood of bitter tears which feel upon her&#xD;
cheeks ! Poor Will was right ux hen he said&#xD;
lie did not knoow how to colpose a letter&#xD;

What did lie mean ?  I)id lie love her or&#xD;
did lie not ?  )id lie want to marry her, or&#xD;
did lie not ? Was she to wait two years fot&#xD;

BAG GLETHORPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
One thing was painfully clear in the letter,'&#xD;
and it was the only thing that was clear,&#xD;
IIe seemed to wish her to understand that&#xD;
she must not love him any longer-must riot&#xD;
play Juliet to his Romeo on any future oc-&#xD;
casion, because henceforth they were to be&#xD;
" friends" only, " dear, lear friends" and&#xD;
nothing more.&#xD;
Friends! Fudge ! Could she be nothing&#xD;
more than a friend to him-the first man&#xD;
who had ever stirred her heart to love? No ,&#xD;
he asked the impossible. She would see him&#xD;
tic iore.&#xD;
But could she stand so severe a. test as&#xD;
this? Could she run the chance of meeting&#xD;
him in the streets, and have courage enough&#xD;
to turn her head away from himx  and shun&#xD;
him?&#xD;
She felt like a child standing on the rocky&#xD;
shore of an angry sea-a sudden gust of&#xD;
wind might sweep her over to be lost. She&#xD;
wasp not iimuch more than a child; but in&#xD;
somie cireum-stances ani instant of time suif-&#xD;
fiees to fully mature such childhood as hers.&#xD;
She grew very eahen now; the tears were&#xD;
dry on her cheeks, and her whole bearing&#xD;
was dignilied and composed. With a steady&#xD;
step, she went down-stairs and opened the&#xD;
door of her guardian's room.&#xD;
Mr. Ihagglethuorpe was glancing through a&#xD;
volume of Shakespeare-his favorite after-&#xD;
breakfast recreation. It " toned hii up," he&#xD;
said. The girl walked up to the old man,&#xD;
andi tlaid hx'er hand in his.&#xD;
My dear," he said, looking at her pale&#xD;
face wxeithi surprise. " What is the matter ?"&#xD;
Only this, Guardy," she answered, "I&#xD;
want to go away."&#xD;
lie gazed at her over his spectacles with&#xD;
blank astonishment, and she repeated the&#xD;
words.&#xD;
I want to go away.'&#xD;
"Away ? Away from where?     Surely not&#xD;
a-away from mei 1"&#xD;
She threw her arms about his neck and&#xD;
. kissed him fondly.&#xD;
"Oh ! no," she exclaimed  not from you&#xD;
--ih ! no. I want to go away from   this&#xD;
place ; miles away from it ! I want to be&#xD;
somewhere where  I shall never lay eyes on&#xD;
r  hin agaix.&#xD;
" On who, child 2"&#xD;
" On Willie Gentry," she answered, crying&#xD;
&#xD;
"What has happened ?" asked the good&#xD;
Mr. Bagglethorpe, with blazing eyes.&#xD;
Guardy, I should have told you long ago,&#xD;
but I scarcely knew it myself until now ; and&#xD;
that is, I-that I love him so dearly-so&#xD;
fondly, and lie-he-"&#xD;
He ?' asked the old man fiercely, and&#xD;
pressing her slight little figure closely in his&#xD;
arms. ''lIe what ?"&#xD;
Ile loves me too, dearly," she answered.&#xD;
But he don't want to marry tire--"&#xD;
"nWI? 2"&#xD;
'o.  lie wants me to be his dear friend&#xD;
only-''&#xD;
Damn   him ! I'll kill him !" shouted&#xD;
the good Mr. Bagglethorpe, dealing a blow on&#xD;
the table which might almost have broken all&#xD;
our of its legs at once.&#xD;
Oh! no, no, Guardy--no, Guardy---don't&#xD;
Don't say such terrible words !Im mex-&#xD;
plaminiig it all wrong.  You shall read his&#xD;
letter, and I will tell you all that has ever&#xD;
happened between us. There is no harm&#xD;
done, Guardy--not the least in the world !"&#xD;
She laid her hand on her heart and sighed,&#xD;
and after they had read the letter, began her&#xD;
story---her simple little story of love-adora-&#xD;
tion-idolatry--lavislied-upon an object, recip-&#xD;
rocated by an object.  It was the A B C&#xD;
of love. Like all primers, it had been easy&#xD;
enough at first, and pleasant study; but then&#xD;
that "hard word " in three syllables, Miu iii&#xD;
Aos: had con ; and very hard it was.&#xD;
The two old people listened to her ;ond&#xD;
listening, their hearts warmed. Not alone to&#xD;
her and to the boy on whom she poured such&#xD;
lavish and wild encomium, but to each other.&#xD;
They too had loved thus ; yes, and thus, spite&#xD;
of age, ad-ersi tv, sorrow, suffering, and pain,&#xD;
thus, thank God, the two old hearts loved each&#xD;
other still.&#xD;
" And so I thought I had better come to&#xD;
you and tell you. I come to you in this as I&#xD;
have come to you for years, moy more than&#xD;
father and mother. I had such. a dreadful&#xD;
moment of temptation. I felt that I must&#xD;
rush away to him and fly from yoi-you who&#xD;
have been all im all to me. And, dear Guardy,&#xD;
I am  young yet, and experienced in the&#xD;
ways of the world ; but I know that I lov,-&#xD;
him and that lhe loves me."&#xD;
There was a moment of silence, and first&#xD;
&#xD;
uviUti'1  (RIOS, .                     25&#xD;
one then the other kissed the girl tenderly.&#xD;
She sobbed as though her heart would break.&#xD;
" I hate myself. I do," she said. "1 am&#xD;
wronging you in loving him so much. And&#xD;
I am going to try to contlter it."&#xD;
You cani not, dear," said Mr. Bagglethorpe&#xD;
gravely.  "You can not conquer it. Love is&#xD;
yoosially lictered as a little boy without an&#xD;
clothess on, much less steel armor-hut he's a&#xD;
tough one to deal with--tougher'n any other&#xD;
of the creeters of mytholergy, to my notion.&#xD;
Ef I hied hed the making oni him, 1 should hev&#xD;
peitered him a six-looter withi a vizier draw red&#xD;
down over his face, and a double-edge scored&#xD;

" What shall I do, Guardyl x-"&#xD;
"You can't do  anv thin', you pore leetle&#xD;

tImmiceelyer,'' Was the dignified reply,&#xD;

in a tender embrace.&#xD;

TttoT evening, as the Gentry family sat at&#xD;
tea, the brawny Ellen was summoned to the&#xD;
door by the active ringing of the bell there-&#xD;
of.  And coming back antntouncedt that,&#xD;
"Sure, 'tn, the ;good Mistlier Baggiltharp,'tt,&#xD;
an' ie's in the pairlor a-nwaitin'."&#xD;
" Nay, that is an error, my innercent and&#xD;
guileless Bridget," remarked Mr. Baggle-&#xD;
thorpe, entering the dining-room, with his hat&#xD;
in his hand, and bowing low.&#xD;
Will gentry spran to his feet, napkin in&#xD;
htatnd, tossed between the conflictiig emotions&#xD;
of astonislunent at this apparition and a wild&#xD;
desire to offer it a chair.&#xD;
Mr. Bagglethorpe took his hat affectionately&#xD;
to his breast, and lunched at once into his&#xD;
speech.&#xD;
"i tr. and Mrs. Genterv-sir and madam----&#xD;
set doxwn, 'William, 1 do not wiht to set&#xD;
down myself--my dooty is with your parents,&#xD;
umy son.  I am here, my friends-if you will&#xD;
permit the term-as a unworthy ambassador&#xD;
from the court of love. But excuse mtc.  I&#xD;
ramble.  The pint is this. You Itv ben in-&#xD;
formed that your est little son has contracted&#xD;
a attachment so to speak, for the young lady&#xD;
who is known to the public by the title of Lar&#xD;
Peetette }'efeene.  Es I tinderstadtl, this&#xD;
yere attachment is not es agreeable to you es&#xD;
it is to the young people.  Quite lateral, Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Gentery.   This young man, feeling'&#xD;
that his fast ilooty is to his parrensts, has&#xD;
nobly, manly, self-sacrificin'ly, writ a letter to&#xD;
my ward, station' the circumstances, and asking'&#xD;
for time---askin' fir two years of time.  I tin&#xD;
quite es willing , sir and nadlai, to grant that&#xD;
time, es your honerbhle selves. The young&#xD;
iatn's sal is tit seeh as to warrant him in&#xD;
takin' a wife, while his parents liev a -laim&#xD;
which he, in his filyul beauty and loveliness,&#xD;
reco'nizes. What it lies cost his brave young&#xD;
heart to take this step, you may not know,&#xD;
but you can no doubt realize if you make a&#xD;
proper effort so to do. Onet you was yount&#xD;
Mr., and Mrs. Gentery.-oiet you also was a&#xD;
&#xD;
suitor at the court of love, Mr. Gentery--as&#xD;
I was, as Mrs. B. was, as we all was.   The&#xD;
feelix' which anerimates the bosom  of your&#xD;
noble and well-edicated son, is the same feel-&#xD;
in' that we too hey felt.  It is a feeling' in the&#xD;
presence of which no honerble man kan say,&#xD;
I ant better ner thou. But I will not ratnble.&#xD;
The pint is this. Feefeene is as dear to mIle, Mr-&#xD;

creature' hes crcp itto iy heart of hearts, and&#xD;
it will cost ie a pang to part xx it lher.  But&#xD;
I shell do my dooty.&#xD;
The good Mr. Bagglethorpe's eyes were&#xD;
filled with tears, and lie no longer looked at&#xD;
his tudieice, but kipt his gaze steadily fixed&#xD;
upon the Ceihin' overhead, till he had con-&#xD;
eltudedl his speech.&#xD;
