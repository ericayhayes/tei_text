CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"How brightly down th'e burning west&#xD;
The monarch sun now sinks to rest,&#xD;
Flinging abroad his breath of gold,&#xD;
O'er all the clouds collected there,&#xD;
Like bannered armiesto behold&#xD;
Day dying on his gorgeous car."&#xD;
IE sun -is westering slowly toward its setting. The&#xD;
low, murky clouds, that have hung as a pall over the&#xD;
earth, are gilded and brightened by the lengtllening&#xD;
rays, and are hailing away - away --over the horizon,&#xD;
to be in at the close of the day.. "The flashing and foaming&#xD;
waves have left the sea, and all her isles in calm at last, and&#xD;
in the" silent heart of the ocean, are murmuring their night&#xD;
song, a soft serenade, to the "Genii of the deep" dreaming&#xD;
in the coral caves. The golden beams glance tremblingly&#xD;
athwart each tree and tower, and anon on, the breeze, comes&#xD;
the soft cooing of the lonely cushit, echoing fartherand farther,&#xD;
and still more faintly, till at last the gentle notes float into&#xD;
nothingness, in the deep of the forest. ~'The gray-winged eagle is&#xD;
fleeing over the golden hill-tops to the mountaineyry, where&#xD;
the young birds wait, eager for the mother's coming; acid low&#xD;
in the valleys, the wild flowers lift their pale, snowy faces up-&#xD;
ward, watching for the return kiss of the dewdrop, that had&#xD;
fled before the morning brightness.&#xD;
Sunset i Brussels!&#xD;
The great old elms in the park, very patriarchs in their&#xD;

towering elms -giant sons of nature -have stood there tri-&#xD;
hant through the storms and tempests of years, have&#xD;
looked calmly and silently down, upon the dynasties as they&#xD;
e out, and left the royal power behind. The Arch-&#xD;
duke of Austria, the King of France, and finally the&#xD;
Netherlands themselves, have, passed under those spreading&#xD;
branches, and given place to the Prince of Saxe-Coburg.&#xD;
This evening the shadows of these huge trees - venerable&#xD;
fathers that could tell- such legends of pride, and power, and&#xD;
destruction --lay solemnly and, silently on the soft green&#xD;
sward of the park in which they stood; and the beautifully&#xD;
gravelled walks around seemed in their winnings. a rich trace-&#xD;
work or broidery, on the emerald sheen. The park was ani-&#xD;
mate with life. Here, were groups of children trundling their&#xD;
hoops; there, a merry cluster of boys bounded over the grass,&#xD;
in chase of the swift-flying ball, their game participated in, and&#xD;
enlivened, by their canine attaches, which, according to Ger-&#xD;
an fancy, must form a conspicuous feature in every party.&#xD;
Seated on'the rustic benches, which, for comfort and conven-&#xD;
ience, were placed under the wide-armed trees, were quiet little&#xD;
maidens, of ages from six to ten, their worthy nurses,.or bon-&#xD;
adingear them, being the chief dignitaries of these in-&#xD;
formal gatherings. This afternoon, the pleadings of the littleiea&#xD;
misses to "go home" were all unheeded, as the topic under&#xD;
consideration was one of unusual interest; ideed, just then&#xD;
the a11-absorbing theme of Brussels, and discussed with extra-&#xD;
ordinary vehemence -the approaching marriage of the lovely&#xD;
Princess Carlotta, with the Archduke Maximilian of Austria.&#xD;
It is from the echoes of the words of the masses, from the&#xD;
lips of the lowly, that we catch the true character of royalty.&#xD;
To the uninitiated,- all kings are noble, all queens are lovely.&#xD;
Catherine and Elizabeth sat proudly on their Russian throne.&#xD;
Men bent in homage before them. But in the dark, fetid&#xD;
streets of St. Petersburg was there found a voice lifted in bless-&#xD;
for them? .Sought they ever to ameliorate the condition&#xD;
of the miserable denizens of their capital? Did they think&#xD;
of aught save splendor and power; the glittering coronet on&#xD;
their brow, the sceptre in their hand ? Turn to the hospitals&#xD;
of France; stop by the couch of the sick and dying, ques-&#xD;
tion them  of their comforter, and around whose name will&#xD;
blessings cluster ? What brighter gem shines in Eugenie's im-&#xD;
erial crown; what words more precious tou heart, than the&#xD;
"Vive 'Imperatrice "! coming from the fevered lps, of those&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
whose sufferings she has alleviated; not alone, by her generous&#xD;
bounty, but by the doubly appreciated gift of her own pres-&#xD;
ence, the soothing touch of her own hand?&#xD;
"And you say, Dame Van Zandt, that the Prussian Count's&#xD;
heart is. broken by our Princess' marriage'?  The idea' of a&#xD;
Count presuming to link with royalty ! " The speaker was a&#xD;
young woman, some three or four and twenty; judging from&#xD;
her bright-colored gown, jaunty cap, and gay ribbons, one would&#xD;
guess that the subject, in ifs general bearing upon matrimony,&#xD;
was near to her heart. She held by the hand 'a little girl, the&#xD;
richness of whose dress bespoke her a child of the nobility.&#xD;
"Hush your silly ratingg" cried Dame Van Zandt.,. " A&#xD;
cat can look at , a king ! Heaven knows, the angel Michael&#xD;
himself would be none too good for our, beautiful Princess.&#xD;
God bless her ! How well I remember an afternoon -now&#xD;
nearly ten years ago-- shortly after I was first left a widow.&#xD;
I had been hunting a situation all day, but as I had no letters&#xD;
of recommendation, I found it hard work to get a place. Rob-&#xD;
bie and I were dragging ourselves wearily along, just by the&#xD;
Park here, and we had seated ourselves to rest near the gate&#xD;
-- that very gate, you all see yonder. I was sobbing and cry-&#xD;
ig, I felt so lonely and 'disheartened, when I heard Robbie&#xD;
clap his little hands, and start up from my side, crying out with&#xD;
delight to me, "look, mother, look!"  I hushed up, and&#xD;
lifted my head; there was the royal coach, with the grand&#xD;
horses, just as we see them now, only they drove six then;&#xD;
they were a present from the Queen's father, the King of&#xD;
France, so they said. The horses and carriage and coachman&#xD;
were all glittering with their gold and silver trappings; it&#xD;
would dazzle your very eyes to look long on them. In the car-&#xD;
riage was King Leopold, looking gloomy and stern, as- he&#xD;
always does; but he has a good heart, for all that, and it's&#xD;
trouble makes him so. By his side, was the Queen Louisa,&#xD;
with her soft, melancholy face, that made one sad to see; she&#xD;
has gone to her rest now. Indeed, good soul, she had enough&#xD;
to make her sorry, for you all know the King's heart, they&#xD;
say, was in the grave with his first wife,-and the Queen knew&#xD;
it too. But howbeit, it must not break off my story. They&#xD;
had driven in from Lacken, which is the summer palace, you&#xD;
know. Just on the front seat, like a ray.of sunshine, was the&#xD;
little Princess Carlotta. I whispered. to Robbie, to clap hs-&#xD;
hands loud as they passed, and the darling, rising on his poor&#xD;
weary fet, did his best. The little Princess smiled, on him,&#xD;

&#xD;
such a sweet, bright smile, and, as the carriage whirled past,&#xD;
threw out to him a bunch of shining red berries and green leaves,&#xD;
- winter-green,---- that she held in her hand. I've got them to&#xD;
this day, put away with poor dead Robbie's clothes, and never&#xD;
look at them but I pray the blessed Virgin to watch over, and&#xD;
keep from all danger, that precious angel child !"&#xD;
The tears stood in the good dame's eyes, as she finished the&#xD;
recital of her simple story of the past. She had gathered an&#xD;
attentive, and appreciative audience around her, for how&#xD;
eagerly do those who walk through life in the humbler ranks&#xD;
listen to stories of royalty -- stories that to them seem almost&#xD;
magical. Just as in our own America, tales. of the fairy god-&#xD;
mother and enchanted princes are the dreams of childhood, from&#xD;
hall to hovel, and are the foundations upon which poor real&#xD;
Cinderellas build castles of future greatness.&#xD;
"But, Dame, what was it, you were saying about the&#xD;
Count?"&#xD;
" Well, have patience, and I will tell you," said the Dame&#xD;
with dignity. "The butler told me that our young ladies said&#xD;
this morning at breakfast, that Count Hardenberg would not&#xD;
carry so light a heart home to Berlin as he brought here ; that&#xD;
the Princess' marriage would be a death-blow to his affections&#xD;
-yes, 'to his affections:' those were the words. There were a&#xD;
great many other things said," continued the Dame, as, lower-.&#xD;
ing her voice significantly, she noticed the unsatisfied looks of&#xD;
her listeners, "which I, being one of the family, do not feel at&#xD;
liberty to repeat."&#xD;
So the Dame's lips were sealed. She enveloped herself in a&#xD;
mantle of wisdom, and silence, and the morbid curiosity she&#xD;
had awakened in the minds of her hearers, in regard to the&#xD;
" powers that be," died a violent death, and little she cared. . She&#xD;
was the oracle of the Park, her situation as nurse in one of&#xD;
the first families of the nobility giving her prestige of posi-&#xD;
tion; and surely, no Pythoness or priestess ministering at the&#xD;
Temple of Jupiter Ammon could be more profoundly mute or&#xD;
fearfully mysterious than she, when in Dame Van Zandt's&#xD;
judgment, the occasion required it.&#xD;
"Dame Van Zandt thinks nobody knows anything 'but her-&#xD;
self;" said the girl with the jaunty cap in a piqued tone. "My&#xD;
Lady Alice, who goes to all the court balls, and sees the Prin-&#xD;
cess and the court gentlemen as often as anybody does, says&#xD;
that it is the Austriarn Count, that everybody thinks so hand-&#xD;
some, that has fallen in love with the Princess.'"&#xD;
&#xD;

jf&#xD;

&#xD;
-s&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, perhaps you know, -perhaps you know,- Mademoi-&#xD;
selle Rachel," said Dame Van Zandt, with an air of 'offended&#xD;
dignity, as she noticed the triumphant glance of the speaker&#xD;
at those around. "Ah ! there's the sunset bell! Come,! chil-&#xD;
dren, we must be going."&#xD;
Down, - down, like a monarch sinking to rest, with all the&#xD;
glories of his celestial satellites clustering in a glittering crown&#xD;
on his brow, the King of Day bade adieu to one hemisphere&#xD;
only to reveal his rising splendors to another. The bells of St.&#xD;
Ghudule ring out on the. quiet evening air, the hour of ves-&#xD;
pers. Like incense, rising in scented aroma on the sacred&#xD;
altars of ancient temples, from a thousand hearts, on land and&#xD;
sea, go forth softly murmured prayers, and the sweetly flowing&#xD;
strains of the "Ave Maria."    The restless Arab, bounding,&#xD;
over the desert plain, at the last lingering smile of the day&#xD;
turns his face to the Holy Mecca shrine, and, as in fancy he&#xD;
hears the Muezzin's solemn call of " Alla Hu !" offers his even-&#xD;
ing orisons in the faith of a true Osmanli.&#xD;
"I love to steal awhile away&#xD;
From every cumbering care,&#xD;
And spend the hours of closing day&#xD;
In silent, fervent prayer."&#xD;
The gentle sentiment finds an echo in every heart, and is the&#xD;
link which binds the absent, that time nor distance breaks&#xD;
Friends parted, - "it may be for years, or it may be forever,"&#xD;
with Alpine. heights looming up, or the broad sea rolling be-&#xD;
tween, at this sacred hour, stand in soul together in the  res-&#xD;
ence of the living God, and lay their evening spirit-sacrifice,&#xD;
upon the same high altar.- St. Ghudule ! - How softly we&#xD;
murmur the name, fearing lest we hush the faint echo that&#xD;
fancy is chiming ; toning our voices, that we may not ut to&#xD;
flight the white-winged birds of memory, which gleam o'er the&#xD;
misty sea of years, that have rolled between the past, and the&#xD;
present.&#xD;
We are in the old' cathedral, gazing in wonderment on that&#xD;
master-piece of genius - its pulpit.* Verbruggen has indeed&#xD;
left a noble monument to his memory, in that work of his&#xD;
hands; for into the carved wood, he has breathed a sermon&#xD;
more eloquent in its silent warning, than those that come through&#xD;
the voice of man. There, materialized, and embodied in tangi-&#xD;

ble form, we see the sin "that brought death into the world,&#xD;
and all our woe;" we see the guilt of our first parents, and we&#xD;
catch the words of the angel "Depart ye," as with uplifted&#xD;
sword he waves them out of Paradise, and points to the desert&#xD;
of the world, where now they must wander, with the curse of&#xD;
transgression upon their hearts.&#xD;
"Theworid was all before them where to choose&#xD;
Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.&#xD;
They, hand in hand, with wand'ring steps, and slow,&#xD;
Through Eden took their solitary way."&#xD;
Hover still with us birds of Fancy!   Show us the classic-&#xD;
wood of Soignies, the deadly field of Waterloo, - the battle&#xD;
plain that tells us --&#xD;
"How in an hour the power which gave annuls&#xD;
Its gifts, transferring fame, as fleeting too."&#xD;
Softly the sunlight falls across the plain, and rests upon the&#xD;
old Chateau ilougomont, whos echarred and blackened ruins&#xD;
stand a monument to the brave men who fell in its defence, and&#xD;
mark the spot where perished the flower of Napoleon's imperial&#xD;
guard. Flit onward, heavenly bird, to beautiful Lacken, with&#xD;
its deep-shadowed groves, its winding walks, and sequestered&#xD;
dells, the home of royalty in the glad summer-time, and the&#xD;
birth-place of the Princess Carlotta. The birds of fancy are&#xD;
gone, and the sound of those silver-toned bells still floats on the'&#xD;
evening air."&#xD;
The soft chimes came to the Princess Carlotta, as she sat near&#xD;
one of the great windows of the long drawing-room of the pal-&#xD;
ace, gazing dreamily at the spires and steeples, whose forms, in&#xD;
the misty twilight, were fading into hazy outline.. The young&#xD;
Princess had awakened from the dream    of. youth.  She had&#xD;
passed through the enchanted land of childhood and girlhood,&#xD;
with its golden-hued atmosphere, plucking the flowers that grew&#xD;
therein -roses, that had no thorns; had listened to the warb-&#xD;
lings of birds, that had no discordant notes; had stopped beside&#xD;
the fountain whose crystal waters contained no bitter drop.&#xD;
Though a mother's hand had not led her there, yet tenderly, as&#xD;
both father and mother, had King Leopold guided her, and pro--&#xD;
tected her young heart from evil. But a vision had crossed&#xD;
her path - a knight, clad in royal armor, had bade her "look&#xD;
up " and in obeying, a voice, -the voice of her own heart,&#xD;
whispered, "HKe must lead, and thou must follow." '&#xD;
This evening, her young mind was borne by the lulling sounds&#xD;
&#xD;
:&#xD;
&#xD;
without, into the future, and as she sat watching the day depart,&#xD;
a feeling somewhat akin to sadness crept into her heart. She&#xD;
had, indeed, begun anew and fateful life. Two months before, a&#xD;
letter and miniature of the Archduke Maximilian of Austria, of&#xD;
the House of Hapsburg, had been placed in her hand, by Count&#xD;
Victor Isolani, a young Tyrolese nobleman, and a friend of&#xD;
Prince Maximilian.  Carlotta had seen the young prince at&#xD;
her father's court some six months before, and this letter, which&#xD;
contained a declaration of his love, was but an answer to the&#xD;
song her own heart, in its secret chambers, had been chanting.&#xD;
:.To-day, the special Ambassador Extraordinary, Count Arquinto,&#xD;
from Austria, had made to her a formal offer of the hand of his&#xD;
highness in marriage ; and she, in accepting, plighted him her,&#xD;
troth, naming, at the Archduke's earnest solicitation, an early&#xD;
day for the consummation of their vows. This evening had&#xD;
been appointed, for a grand reception at the palace ; and as it&#xD;
would probably be the last appearance of the Princess in public,&#xD;
before her marriage, there was a touch of sadness in the thought,&#xD;
that threw a half shadow over the bright picture of her future&#xD;
joy. The Austrian ambassador and his suite, would leave im-&#xD;
mediately for Vienna, and the days speeding quickly by, would,&#xD;
before another moon, make her a bride.&#xD;
Did the Princess tremble, and shrink from the new and&#xD;
strange country, the far-reaching, unknown plains.of the world&#xD;
through which her journey lay ?  No, no ! Had she not one to&#xD;
lead her that would not forsake her, and though there might&#xD;
be rough places and broken ways in the path, he would bear&#xD;
her over in safety.&#xD;
As Carlotta gazed upou the open, manly countenance, that&#xD;
looked up into her eyes, from the miniature she held in her&#xD;
hand, a smile of pleasure lighted up her soft, beauteous face;&#xD;
but in a moment it died into an expression of subdued thought-&#xD;
fulness, as often, "e'en as we are gazing," the golden fleecy&#xD;
clouds of the morning, imperceptibly tone themselves into the&#xD;
solemn tints of the deepening purple.&#xD;
" He is very handsome !" exclaimed the Princess, "  and - of&#xD;
his goodness and nobility I am convinced; but ah, me! that&#xD;
cannot bring happiness to a loveless heart. Can I inspire in&#xD;
him the devotion I am yearning for?" she murmured half audi-&#xD;
bly. The tears stood in her soft, lustrous eyes, at the possibility&#xD;
of the freshness of her young heart, that already warmed and.&#xD;
thrilled with the thought of him, whose open faith was* hers.&#xD;
Would the roses of love, that blossoming, gladdened her whole.&#xD;

nature, be esteemed worthy of plucking, or would they be left&#xD;
to wither, rudely crushed by one who, accepting the offer-&#xD;
ing of another heart, had perhaps learned the pleasant song, and&#xD;
woven the golden spell under the charm of tones, more silvery,&#xD;
mayhap, than hers ? Did she trust his devoted promises? Ah!&#xD;
there is the issue ! For take a woman's life, empress, princess,&#xD;
or village maiden, and with those fateful words, "happy or&#xD;
blighted love," the tale is fully told. Unhappiness is the same&#xD;
in all the intricate windings of the world; and though the bur-&#xD;
dening cross may be of gold, it does not weigh less heavy than&#xD;
the deeply carved cypress wood. Sorrow drapes the chambers&#xD;
of the soul in the same dark hangings, and though the dome of&#xD;
the temple be gilded, and burnished, the mourner's humble&#xD;
shrine looks up to the same heaven, through whose pearly gates&#xD;
and over whose glittering streets, the dark companion of their&#xD;
earthly pilgrimage shall not trail her gloomy robes, that in&#xD;
their moving, give forth the sad, murmuring sound of weeping&#xD;
and mourning.&#xD;
" What ! my dear Princess in tears?"&#xD;
It was the voice of ,her favorite friend and governess, the&#xD;
Countess Vossburgh, who had entered the room unperceived,&#xD;
and had stolen to the side of the Princess at the window.&#xD;
Bending gently over her, she looked long and earnestly into&#xD;
,her sweet face.&#xD;
"Your last reception in Brussels, my darling ? Does that&#xD;
solve the pearly enigma?  Tell me, have I guessed rightly,&#xD;
Carlotta?"&#xD;
The members of the royal family had gone out for an evening&#xD;
drive, the Princess remaining at home on plea of slight indis-&#xD;
position; the Countess. had remained with her, but a few&#xD;
moments before, the Princess had left her chamber, and, unob-&#xD;
served, found her way into the drawing-room, whither the&#xD;
Countess followed her.&#xD;
As she now tendered her sympathies-so gently as she was wont&#xD;
to do, Carlotta placed her arm about her, and drooped her head&#xD;
downward, until her long waving curls fell athwart the dark&#xD;
hair of her friend.&#xD;
" Ma Mignonne," said the Countess, gently, " you are young,&#xD;
and it wrings your heart to go from your girlhood's home ; but&#xD;
there are compensations for your sacrifice. Think what an alli-&#xD;
ance has been made for you. One of the noblest sons of an il-&#xD;
lustrious house, Archduke of Austria, Viceroy of Italy, young,&#xD;
and handsome; and, if we may trust all we have heard of his&#xD;
&#xD;
'&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
many good qualities and generous nature, he is one to fill a&#xD;
woman's heart."&#xD;
i "I know, I know," said Carlotta, "it is not that, Countess.&#xD;
Is it not a marriage of policy with- him? a hateful alliance&#xD;
thrust upon him, and he comes to the altar an unwilling sacri-&#xD;
Jice ?  I may be very childish and weak -perhaps it is unbe-&#xD;
coming a princess to entertain such thoughts, but, as the event-&#xD;
ful time comes near, I have a trembling feeling in my heart,&#xD;
that perhaps I may not be able to win his love ; I have given&#xD;
my whole nature to the dream; and if it should be rudely bro-&#xD;
ken! "&#xD;
"I know, my precious child," said the Countess, "all that.&#xD;
fills your mind with vague, inexpressible fears; but I feel as.&#xD;
sured they are groundless. Accord to the Archduke the same&#xD;
tender emotions that you experience. Do not go to him, Car-&#xD;
lotta, with a mind prone to doubt, and entertain misgivings.&#xD;
Believe that he loves you, and you will be loved."&#xD;
"Ah ! your old theory, Countess," said Carlotta, smiling&#xD;
"that 'lote begets love.' For your sake, I will strive to ban-&#xD;
ish all fear and all regret from my heart, keeping there as a fa-&#xD;
vored guest only Hope. Do you remember, Countess, the little&#xD;
verses I read to you written by the hapless Lady Jane Grey,&#xD;
for the shedding of whose innocent blood the royal Mary can&#xD;
never atone? you remember them&#xD;
"'Invisible bright water, so like air,&#xD;
On looking down, I fear'd thou could'st not bear&#xD;
My little bark, of all light barks most light ;&#xD;
And looked again, and drew me from the'sight,&#xD;
And hanging back, breathed each fresh gale aghast,&#xD;
And held the. bench, not togo on so fast.'&#xD;
"The verses she composed while on a ;sailing excursion;&#xD;
and to-night I found myself repeating this one o'er and o'er. I&#xD;
feel as the Lady did: the stream' of Time is bearing me on too&#xD;
fast. I am saying adieu to dear landmarks too often, and I&#xD;
cling to what I know is true, and beautiful, and good; I fear&#xD;
the mighty current of the world will wreck 'my little bark,&#xD;
of all light barks most light.'"&#xD;
"Your tender heart, my Princess," said the Counters&#xD;
thoughtfully, "has as yet known but little of sorrow, has felt&#xD;
naught of evil. But believe me, child, though you leave these&#xD;
dearly cherished landmarks, God does not send thee into- the&#xD;
new, untried paths, alone and defenceless. He takes thy hand;-&#xD;
He gives thee truth, courage, and constancy as-companions; and&#xD;

when thy spirit is faint, He whispers softly, lovingly, ' I will&#xD;
not leave thee nor forsake thee.' But, child, hug to thy heart&#xD;
this heavenly philosophy; learn to trust more ; a-doubting&#xD;
spirit, Carlotta, is its own greatest enemy and tormentor.&#xD;
Trust thy husband, and bind him to thee with hooks of steel.&#xD;
Establish that perfect unity of purpose and confidence, which&#xD;
is the sure and only basis of conjugal happiness; for even in&#xD;
the high estate to which thou art called, the same general prin-&#xD;
ciples apply as to a burgher's wife. Win the Archduke to thee&#xD;
by gentle fancies; show him what is true, and high, and good in&#xD;
woman's nature; and, as the stronger sex have always the&#xD;
greater portion of the dross:of humanity, elevate whatever may&#xD;
be found of earthliness in thy husband's mind; and pray to God,&#xD;
-- fervently pray,-that in you both what is weak, He will&#xD;
make strong!"-&#xD;
The kind words of her preceptress fell upon the Princess's&#xD;
listening ear, as dew upon the flowers.  Into her heart there&#xD;
came an inbreathing strength, and she began to have faith in&#xD;
herself and faith in God, that He would give her power to fill&#xD;
the duties of her approaching station.  She would do her,&#xD;
best, and more is not accorded unto mortal.&#xD;
Rising from the seat by the window, with her eyes beaming&#xD;
visibly, even in the dusky twilight which was gathering about&#xD;
them, she exclaimed earnestly;-&#xD;
" Countess, God being my helper, I will give to the Arch-&#xD;
duke Maximilian all the happiness and joy that a true, loving&#xD;
wife can bestow ! And in the long years of life, that we may&#xD;
pass together, through sunshine and through shade, ever at his&#xD;
side, I will be faithful found."&#xD;
" God bless you, my child !" whispered the Countess, as she&#xD;
tenderly kissed the Princess. " Come, now," she added in a&#xD;
gayer tone, "a brighter smile to-night, your last for Cupid's&#xD;
conquests in Brussels ! "&#xD;
" Yes," answered'the Princess, "banish dull care to-night."&#xD;
And she followed the Countess into the large, wide hall, hum-&#xD;
ming, sotto voce, the beautiful air, "Parigi o' Cara."&#xD;
The Protean face of Day has shown its last change ; the&#xD;
slow-walking twilight has, in her dusky robes passed through&#xD;
the city, and, as the misty shadow of her veil is lifted from the&#xD;
blue ether, the stars creep out in the high dome above, until&#xD;
the vaulted roof of heaven is thick inlaid with " patines of bright&#xD;
gold," and in their midst the full-orbed moon " proclaims the Si-&#xD;
lent reign of night."&#xD;
&#xD;
The business streets of the city are lined with gay-looking,&#xD;
brilliantly lighted show-windows, that display a confused, but&#xD;
lovely variety of colors, arranged with an artist's skill, to attract&#xD;
the attention of the myriads that hurry to and fro.&#xD;
How the shadows come and go beneath the gaslight,-.- flitting&#xD;
onward, leaving not a trace behind !&#xD;
" They pass to toil, to strife, to rest ;&#xD;
To halls in which the feast is spread;&#xD;
To chambers where the funeral guest&#xD;
In silence sit's beside the dead.&#xD;
"Each where his tasks or pleasures call,&#xD;
They pass, and heed each other not,&#xD;
There is, who heeds, who holds them all&#xD;
In His large love, and boundless though."&#xD;
Onward they go, those that make up the "'ever-shifting&#xD;
train," restless movers in a transitory world, wearing unwit-&#xD;
tingly the invisible Symar of mortality: some to wander, per-&#xD;
haps, before the day dawneth, from   the lowly haunts of vice&#xD;
into the darker shades of Eternity, where their toilsome repent-&#xD;
ance, Ixion-like, ever-beginning, shall never end; and others,&#xD;
charity whispers, are forth on missions of love and mercy, that&#xD;
shall gladden suffering hearts, whose humble dwellings are the&#xD;

In thelong drawing-room of the royal palace, the members&#xD;
of the King's household, and the noble families of Brussels were&#xD;
assembled to offer their congratulations to the bride elect. It&#xD;
was a scene of festive beauty. The light from the grand chan-&#xD;
deliers, rising in diminishing circles of brightness, glittered&#xD;
through crystal pendents revealing their prismatic glories, and&#xD;
~casting a halo over the splendid velvet furniture, and the an-&#xD;
tique' carving of its dark walnut mounting.  The heavy damask&#xD;
curtains, of a bright, crimson hue, almost crushed the' royal&#xD;
laces over which they drooped; now and then, through their&#xD;
half-parted folds showing 'the hidden recess of a bow window,&#xD;
in which stood a couple of gilt chairs, or a cosy divan, invitingly&#xD;
tempting young hearts to a quiet tite-d-tte.&#xD;
On the right, a door ledinto the conservatory, and that, too,&#xD;
was brilliantly illuminated, with colored lights, as was the cus-&#xD;
tom on reception evenings! Collected together there were the&#xD;
rarest exotics: azalia, fuschias, camelias, geraniums, nigh&#xD;
booming jessamines,--.filling the air with sweetness; and the&#xD;

passing zephyr wafted a breath of perfume into the drawing-&#xD;
room, as richly laden with fragrance as the breeze that steals&#xD;
from the far-off isle of Ceylon to kiss the cheek of beauty on&#xD;
the land.t&#xD;
The Princess Carlotta, the "star of the evening," had in&#xD;
truth banished all tears from her face, and cares from her heart.&#xD;
Added to. her youthful beauty was an elegant manner, which,&#xD;
though not less affable than usual, had in it a touch of softness,-&#xD;
perhaps from. the memory'of her recent conversation, that&#xD;
 made her unusually fascinating. The tender light that shone&#xD;
in' her beautiful eyes, seemed to beam into the heart of the&#xD;
gazer, and left there forever the remembrance of their liquid&#xD;
brightness.&#xD;
Carlotta seemed anxious to-night, her last as their "young&#xD;
Princess," among her father's friends and her own, to wind&#xD;
herself into their very heart of hearts, by her loveliness and&#xD;
winning affability. - There was not an old Dowager Duchess&#xD;
of near half a century in years, but she had for her some pleas-&#xD;
ant greeting or well-timed compliment.; and the praises of the&#xD;
"charming Princess" "the lovely Princess," were echoed with&#xD;
sincerity from hearts, that she had disarmed of envy.&#xD;
King Leopold himself, the modern Pylian sage, relaxed .his&#xD;
gloomy bearing, and a brightness as of' the sun shining through&#xD;
clouds was visible upon his stern, iron-cast features. Re united&#xD;
with his daughter in sparing no exertion for the agreeable enter-&#xD;
tainment of their guests. And there, too, was the young Duke&#xD;
de Brabant, as the eldest son, heir-apparent to the throne, and&#xD;
his only brother, Count de Flandre, in the uniform of the com-&#xD;
mander of the regiment of Guides, both favorites with the good&#xD;
people :of Brussels. And conspicuous among the guests was&#xD;
the Austrian ambassador, Count Arquinto, and his attaches,&#xD;
who were regarded with jealous eyes, as they came to make&#xD;
Austria's gain Belgium's loss. Pleasantly the hours passed&#xD;
until the time of departure came. At last the adieu of the&#xD;
latest lingerer had been made, and the long state apartments&#xD;
Were deserted.&#xD;
The Austrian ambassador, and the members of his suite, upon&#xD;
their arrival in Brussels, had been received as royal guests, and&#xD;
had been assigned to the apartments adjoining the drawing-room.&#xD;
All was silence throughout the palace. The lights were&#xD;
burning dimly in the hall, as it was the custom to leave them&#xD;
unextinguished through the night on the lower floor.&#xD;
After reaching her own room, the Princess 'Carlotta remem-&#xD;
&#xD;
bered a book of drawings, sketches of her own, from the palace&#xD;
of Lacken, her birthplace, and the environs of the city, which&#xD;
she had left on the mantle in the drawing-room. She was anx-&#xD;
ious to take them with her to Austria, and .fearing she might&#xD;
forget to remove them on the morrow, she determined to go for&#xD;
them herself at once, and by putting them carefully away en-&#xD;
sure their safety. Not wishing to disturb 'her governess, who&#xD;
.occupied the chamber adjoining her, own, and who had retired&#xD;
much fatigued, Carlotta noiselessly opened the door and went&#xD;
out. Stealing down the marble staircase, and through the hall,&#xD;
she softly entered the drawing-room, and going to the huge&#xD;
mantle with its sculptured Caryatides, bearing aloft their burden&#xD;
of handsome Bolognese vases and various articles of virtu, she&#xD;
found the drawings, where she remembered to have left them.&#xD;
Turning from the mantle, she trod lightly over the soft velvet&#xD;
carpeting. There was 'the air of inexpressible sadness that ever&#xD;
pervades an apartment' after a festive gathering is ended, and&#xD;
beauty, joy, and youth departed. The solemn, unbroken still-&#xD;
ness that hung over everything was almost oppressive.&#xD;
Involuntarily, the Princess paused, and waited near the harp&#xD;
which stood in one of the recesses of a window, and was half&#xD;
hidden by the voluminous folds of the curtain.&#xD;
The beating of her own heart,&#xD;
Was all the sound she heard."&#xD;
Half audibly, Carlotta murmured,&#xD;
"I feel like one who treads alone&#xD;
somne bganqueha deserted&#xD;
SmbaqehaldsreWhose lights are fled, whose garlands dead,&#xD;
And all but he, departed."&#xD;
"And all but he, departed!"&#xD;
The words were echoed softly near her. The Princess&#xD;
started, and was about hurrying from the room leaving the&#xD;
mysterious echo undiscovered, when, a glance through the lace&#xD;
curtains, revealed the form of Count Isolani, the young nobleman,&#xD;
who, one month before, had borne to her the Archduke Maxi-&#xD;
milian's first message of love. He stood by the open window,&#xD;
through which peered in the twinkling midnight watchers.&#xD;
"Princess Carlotta !" said he, coming forward, "I crave&#xD;
your pardon for again intruding upon your presence! I can&#xD;
only pead a weak, idolzg heart, that cannot be stilled at the&#xD;
fotalof the one to whom it yields sole .allegiance !"&#xD;

" Count Isolani? again!" said the Princess disapprovingly ;&#xD;
"do you again address me in such terms ? That heart mustbe&#xD;
weak, indeed, that can let the passing fancy of a day, as it were,&#xD;
so quickly obliterate the remembrance of his duty to his friend."&#xD;
"Ah, Princess! your words are true," replied the Count;&#xD;
" but there is no master for Love ; it recognizes faith to nei-&#xD;
ther friend nor foe; there are no obstacles too great for it to&#xD;
surmount, no links too strong for it to break, aye, though it be&#xD;
over mountains of ice or through rivers of blood, true Love&#xD;
defies all to keep it from the object of its affection ! Hear me,&#xD;
Princess Carlotta !" he continued passionately. " When first&#xD;
I saw you in all the beauty of youth, the spirit within me fell&#xD;
down and worshipped. I forgot all, save that I loved, and&#xD;
that it was hopeless ! And yet I dared, when last I met you here&#xD;
at the Palace, to giveit voice; and though my Divinity accords&#xD;
no reward; not one gracious smile, yet it does not in the least&#xD;
still the heart's fervor; and a happy chance has again afforded&#xD;
me the opportunity, of pouring out at your feet, the devoted love&#xD;
of a man's soul!1"&#xD;
His tones were full of earnest impassioned feeling, and as the&#xD;
dim light from the chandelier fell on his tall figure in the em-&#xD;
broidered uniform of an Austrian naval officer, there was a man.&#xD;
liness about his person, a glow upon his handsome face, that would&#xD;
have made his appeal almost irresistible to a maiden's heart.&#xD;
" Count Isolani! " said the Princess, bending her dark eyes&#xD;
full upon him, "I had hoped that when I met you again, I&#xD;
could grasp your hand with the respect due to a friend and&#xD;
companion of the Archduke Maximilian. My vows to him,&#xD;
and my plighted troth, alike forbid me to listen to such avowals&#xD;
as you have presumed to make since you have been in Brussels.&#xD;
I must insist, to-night, upon your sparing me the renewal of&#xD;
your declarations. I would not wound you, Count Isolani, but&#xD;
my womanly pride, nay, my tenacity of aught that would affect&#xD;
Austria'shonor or one of her subjects, bids me stay you from&#xD;
expressions that I know you regret in moments of reflection."&#xD;
Count Isolani gazed upon her in silent admiration.&#xD;
" Princess ! " he exclaimed, bending on his knee before her,&#xD;
"let me bow in homage at the shrine of Truth and Fidelity.&#xD;
Know, that I am as suspicious of a breath upon the honor, which&#xD;
bears so fair a name, as a woman of her spotless purity, and&#xD;
innocence, and I must dissipate the mist that envelops my&#xD;
actions, and seems so freely to falsify my words. As you have&#xD;
heard before, and perhaps, have since wondered to believe, the&#xD;
&#xD;
noble Archduke Maximilian and myself have been as brothers&#xD;
since our youth. Thrown often together at Vienna, where I&#xD;
was sent to be educated, the bond of friendship formed' there,&#xD;
was cemented more strongly, when, afterwards, each joined the&#xD;
navy at Trieste. Together we breasted stormy seas traveled&#xD;
through Greece and Italy, and trod the burning deserts of the&#xD;
East. His bosom held no thought that I was not permitted to&#xD;
share, and my own heart's. dearest feelings were known unto&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Upon the Archduke's return to Vienna, after his visits to&#xD;
France, England, andBelgium,-during which period, Iremained&#xD;
at Trieste,-J discovered that a change had come over the spirit&#xD;
of his dreams.' The wild joyousness of his nature had been&#xD;
softened, and there was no longer the incredulous jest, or laugh,&#xD;
at the influence of the tender passion on the heart. The truth&#xD;
came out at last; from his own lips, I heard it: he had seen the&#xD;
Princess Carlotta, and he loved her! The image of yourself&#xD;
so filled his heart with an exalted admiration, that he dared not&#xD;
trust. himself to hope that he might inspire in you a similar&#xD;
feeling, and his noble nature would scorn to accept the hand&#xD;
of an unloving bride. At his request, I came to Brussels, bear-&#xD;
ing his declaration of love to you by private letter and also a&#xD;
letter to your august father. The Archduke exacted of me a&#xD;
most unusual promise before I left Austria, which I confess it&#xD;
has embarrassed me no little to fulfil: that if you seemed to&#xD;
yield favor to his suit, I would, if possible, test your heart&#xD;
and discover its true beatings. I have perfornied my task, and&#xD;
I trust, Princess, now stand before you, faithful in heart and soul&#xD;
to my noble friend. It is enough,--reward sufficient-that I bear&#xD;
to the Archduke the tidings that he yearns to hear, that the&#xD;
Princess Carlotta has no thought .for other love ; that her soul&#xD;
is filled with one image, and that, his own ! And now in the&#xD;
name of Austria, in whose service my father and forefathers&#xD;
lived and died, and whose example, I have the honor of follow-&#xD;
ing, I bid you welcome ! First, to the heart of the Archduke&#xD;
Maximilian, who is waning to woo you with sweetest strains&#xD;
of love ; then, to the heart of the royal family of Hapsburg-&#xD;
and last, though not least, to the great throbbing heart of the&#xD;
Austrian people, who, chanting their epithalamiums of joy,&#xD;
will make your bridal path of blooming roses and flowery&#xD;
garlands! "&#xD;
The Princess had listened with half-averted head, while&#xD;
Count Isolani spoke: a glad, happy smile stole over her face,~&#xD;

and as he finished, she extended her white hand, on which the&#xD;
jewelled diamonds glittered, and in a voice tremulous with&#xD;
emotion, exclaimed:&#xD;
"Count Isolani, your hand !  Since we stand revealed, let&#xD;
my own heart, in its truth speak for me ! If there has been&#xD;
aught in my words, during your stay in'Brussels, that may have&#xD;
fallen harshly upon the ear of one of Austria's noblest sons,&#xD;
you will forget, and forgive it ! Most deeply do I feel the&#xD;
delicate kindness conveyed in your last words, and sincerely&#xD;
do I thank you. In future, I congratulate the Archduke upon&#xD;
the possession of such a friend ! Count Isolani, I bid you&#xD;
good-night !"&#xD;
With a graceful inclination of her person, the Princess left&#xD;
the room. As her retreating footsteps sounded softly along&#xD;
the marble hall, and at last died away, the Count turned to seek&#xD;
the apartments assigned to him, as an attach of the ambassa-&#xD;
dor. Just before him on the carpet, lay a light gossamer fabric,&#xD;
the Princess' handkerchief. He stooped, and raising it, he ex-&#xD;
claimed, "A tribute for the Archduke ! Purity, Innocence,&#xD;
Truth ! let the Princess Carlotta represent thee !" Bearing the&#xD;
lacy web in his hand he left the drawing-room.&#xD;

CHAPTER IL&#xD;
JHE morning sun of July 6th, 1832, that -sent its&#xD;
beams over the towers and steeples of Vienna, bath-&#xD;
ej ing in golden light the green sward about the beauti-&#xD;
ful palace of Sch  brunn, tipping with brightness the&#xD;
leaves of the gigantic elms through whose branches the summer&#xD;
breeze played i htly to and fro; heralded the natal day of&#xD;
Ferdinand Max'milian Joseph, Archduke of Austria, second&#xD;
son of Francis Charles, (brother to the then reigning Emperor&#xD;
Ferdinand), and likewise grandson, but two degrees removed&#xD;
from the famous Maria Theresa, once Empress of Austria,&#xD;
whose renown fills so large a 'part of the history of the past&#xD;
century.&#xD;
Awaking to an earth-life in the same suburban palace, where&#xD;
for years the Princes of the House of Hapsburg had first Been&#xD;
the light, the royal infant was received with shouts of joy and&#xD;
gratulation, and demonstrative manifestations of pleasure, by&#xD;
the loyal Viennese, whose ancestors had bequeathed to them&#xD;
the precious heritage of German citizenship, and with it&#xD;
had made them part owners, of the noble line of princes,&#xD;
which from this Hapsburg House had given to Germany four-&#xD;
teen emperors, and to Spain six kings.&#xD;
The childhood of the little Archduke passed as that free, un-&#xD;
restrained period ever does, whether in court or cottage. Upon&#xD;
the childish heart there were no weighty burdening cares of&#xD;
state; there was nothing to bow down his spirit, nothing to&#xD;
dash hisjoyous glee. He knew naught of the danger, that&#xD;
threatening the bulwarks of German liberty, might- shake the&#xD;
throne of his ancestors. His brother, Francis Joseph, two&#xD;
years his senior, and two brothers younger, were the companions&#xD;
of his infantile sports-; and as they all grew upward in the&#xD;
scale of being, and reached the dignity of alphabetical aspirants,&#xD;
they were also the sharers of his studies.&#xD;
*Years passed on, and the boy began to throw aside the care-&#xD;

lessness of childhood, and later still, the youth was absorbed in&#xD;
the promise of the man. The young Maximilian unfolded new&#xD;
leaves in the book of Life ; displayed traits of character, and&#xD;
peculiarities of disposition, which gave him a distinctive ex-&#xD;
istence from his companions,,the young nobility at Vienna, and&#xD;
almost made him one apart. There was lacking none of that&#xD;
dashing spirit, and loving generosity in their games, which, in&#xD;
every merry gathering nade him the favored one, around whom&#xD;
all clustered with affection, proclaiming him universally their&#xD;
leader ; but there was beneath the gladsome, light exterior, a&#xD;
deep, noble heart, an under-current, proceeding from a fountain&#xD;
of will, which, though sending forth in the boy only a tiny rivulet,&#xD;
jts existence revealed now and then by the bubbling laugh of&#xD;
scorn with which it dashed over the obstacles in its way,&#xD;
was widening and deepening, till in the soul of the man&#xD;
all hopes, loves, and destinies rpsting upon its bosom would be&#xD;
borne along in its resistless sweep.&#xD;
As he approached the last stages of youth,- and his mind,&#xD;
coming upward with his manly stature, was leaving behind,&#xD;
or rather rolling up, on the palimpsest of his brain the simple&#xD;
facts and unvarnished principles of natural and practical knowl-&#xD;
edge ; as he deepened the impress, and again upon the same&#xD;
brain parchment, inscribed the gleanings of older years, the.&#xD;
young Prince, following the thread given by the prescribed&#xD;
course of study, searching himself into the classical beautiesof&#xD;
antiquity, and again gathering up the shining, polished gems of&#xD;
modern literature, began to .see and feel that there are' "more&#xD;
things in heaven and earth " than are dreamt- of in the common&#xD;
philosophy of this day-darg life ; and there came into his mind&#xD;
.the deep, soul-penetrating and soul-elevating purposes of a&#xD;
man ; a contempt for the gayeties and frivolities of a desolate&#xD;
city, and a strong aversion to those who followed after idols&#xD;
which their own hands had in folly fashioned, aye, contempt for&#xD;
those who, calling themselves the nobility of the land, when&#xD;
asked for a manly proof of claim to that title, could not point&#xD;
to a single pure, and unselfish aim, a single high or God-like&#xD;
action, a single charity -"a cup of cold water "-even, to&#xD;
the least of those who, day after day, touched the hem of their&#xD;
garments ;. but instead, veiled their faces as if to disown the&#xD;
blackened record, where Truth, with unerring finger, had traced&#xD;
the mournful chronicle of a life, whose beautiful spring-time,&#xD;
-with its treasures of hope, as peeping violets and bursting buds&#xD;
had been blasted by the Sirocco breath of the world ; a chron-&#xD;

icle that told of a weak spirit, with no power within, to keep&#xD;
the soul pure and unspotted, amid all the dust and decay&#xD;
through which the man must tread.&#xD;
Too young, according to European regime to be of assist-&#xD;
ance to Germany in the Revolutionary storm of 1848 and 1849&#xD;
when France touched the spark and all Europe felt the shock,&#xD;
Maximilian left Vienna for Trieste, and at the early age of&#xD;
sixteen joined the Austrian navy. He could not have chosen&#xD;
a profession better suited to his nature ; the yearning of his&#xD;
heart for, the wild dash of old Ocean's waves was satisfied, and&#xD;
he gave his whole being up to the free, adventuresome life of a&#xD;
seaman. His spirit chafed under the ordinary restraints of&#xD;
court life, was restless and moody under surveillance. He&#xD;
knew and felt that he could not be measured by the straight,&#xD;
right-angled standard which regulated the conduct of those, his&#xD;
own age, for in his heart there were strong fancies and wild&#xD;
dreams that kept him in a world of his own making, and to&#xD;
the Eden spots of this heart-garden but few were admitted.&#xD;
There was one, - Count Victor Isolani-a youth like himself&#xD;
who, though born at Innsbriick, in the Tyrol, was educated at&#xD;
Vienna; and thrown often with the Archduke, came to be in&#xD;
very truth, a friend of his soul. Together they left Vienna&#xD;
and went to. Trieste, and there, under Admiral Thomas Zermann,&#xD;
began the drilling in nautical tactics which would prepare&#xD;
them each for honorable positions in the navy of the Austrian&#xD;
empire.&#xD;
The storm of 1848 came, and the thrones of Europe were&#xD;
shaken to their very base. "Facts and events have attested&#xD;
the truth of M. Guizot's words, that no principle spreads&#xD;
over the European continent, until it is first naturalized in&#xD;
France." That changeful country is indeed the foster-mother&#xD;
of all revolutionary theories ; and in this political convulsion,.&#xD;
which threatened to overthrow monarchical rule, it was in&#xD;
the Gallic land that the cry first arose, "Vive 16 R6publique!&#xD;
down with royalty, and Louis Philippe,!"&#xD;
The last of the Bourbons left his palace to the insurgents,&#xD;
and fled from his kingdom, where all was confusion and dis-&#xD;
order. France was not alone. The echo of her stirring words,&#xD;
was heard in Italy and Germany. Like an electric spark it&#xD;
thrilled all hearts as it went ; touching at Milan, it passed into&#xD;
Hungary, and then, taking a tangent, was felt in England and&#xD;
Scotland, and again, in ricochet movement, struck at Vienna.&#xD;

unnumbered years, the people rose up, and madly cried out for&#xD;
" Liberty, Equality, and Brotherhood!"&#xD;
Concessions were made,; prime ministers who were odious to&#xD;
the people resigned; freedom of the press, and general political&#xD;
amnesty was proclaimed, not only in Austria, but in Prussia.&#xD;
Still the people were not satisfied, but cried, "More humbling&#xD;
of royalty !" In the meantime the Italian provinces deter-&#xD;
mined to throw off the German yoke, and lent their aid to&#xD;
increase the trouble and embarrassment of Austria. A par-&#xD;
liament was called to meet at Frankfort, to make a new and&#xD;
liberal constitution for Germany; but such was the condition&#xD;
of affairs at Vienna, that on the day of its meeting the Emperor&#xD;
Ferdinand of Austria left his capital, to seek greater safety at&#xD;
Innsbriick. Later in the same year, the Hungarians were de-&#xD;
clared to be in revolt against Austria, contending for a free&#xD;
constitution. Prince Windischgratz marched against Vienna,&#xD;
and after bombarding .and storming the city, it fell into his&#xD;
possession.  The following month, November, 1848, the Aus-&#xD;
trian Diet was convened at ,Kremsier, in Moravia, " to proceed&#xD;
with the work of perfecting the constitution;" and' it was at&#xD;
this juncture that Ferdinand abdicated in favor of his nephew,&#xD;
Francis Joseph, whom he proclai-med Emperor of Austria.&#xD;
When the Imperial mantle was placed upon his shoulders,&#xD;
the Archduke was but nineteen years of age, - a mere youth,&#xD;
surrounded by turbulent Officials and bureaucratic politicians.&#xD;
A daring, Photon-like undertaking for such unskilled hands.&#xD;
But Francis Joseph, with the down yet upon his chin, and the&#xD;
dew of youth upon his cheek, grasped the reins of government,&#xD;
not weakly, or tremblingly, but with firmness, and determina-&#xD;
tion, resolved, that the glory and power belonging to the House&#xD;
of Hapsburg, entrusted now to his keeping, should not perish&#xD;
at the bidding of these reckless revolutionists. After proclaim-&#xD;
ing a liberal constitution, as his inauguration gift to his people,&#xD;
by the exercise of a masterly policy, the young Emperor secured&#xD;
the favorable suffrages of Russia, whose timely assistance en-&#xD;
abled Austria to subdue not only Hungary, but also the prov-&#xD;
inces of Italy, who were compelled to yield allegiance to&#xD;
German rule.&#xD;
So the revolutionary storm  in Europe was lulled    to&#xD;
rest, and the waves of peace rolled on again. In Austria,&#xD;
the reaction, as we have seen, was in favor of ;oyalty ;&#xD;
but in France it was different. There, the people wate: tri-&#xD;
umphant, and the strong hand to seize the reins was found in&#xD;
&#xD;
the young nephew of the great Corsican soldier. Not in vain&#xD;
had Louis Napoleon mingled with the calm, self-possessed&#xD;
statesmen of England; not in vain, had he devoted so many&#xD;
years to the study of men and events; he knew that his labor&#xD;
would be rewarded; for now, when France, sated with the&#xD;
blood of her own children, looked wildly here and there,&#xD;
for a heart strong enough to face her, it was his voice, the&#xD;
voice of a .Bonaparte that called out, " I will be your leader !"&#xD;
and France, recognizing the accents of. determination, had&#xD;
echoed in return, "Long live our Emperor ! Long live Louis&#xD;
Napoleon!&#xD;
And so, in France, too, the Revolution ended. . Revolution !&#xD;
Word 'big with meaning! It tells of governments pulled&#xD;
down, thrones- overturned, guillotines and scaffolds reeking&#xD;
with blood, mad riots, and insane shouts from hearts fevered&#xD;
with fanatical excitement. As such, Europe greets the ambig-&#xD;
uous sound. And yet the same word that calls up scenes of&#xD;
anarchy and strife on one continent, on the other is the key-&#xD;
note to the song of liberty ; the basis of American national&#xD;
History. But treacherous everywhere, in later years it has&#xD;
failed a struggling people. Brave men, who claimed prestige&#xD;
and example from their forefathers, the heroes of '76, look in&#xD;
vain to see their deeds of daring chronicled upon the historic&#xD;
page, as belonging to the "Revolution of '61."  They read&#xD;
in bitterness the words that seem to stand out fiom the. sheet,&#xD;
and taunt and hiss them in their grief. " The Rebellion in the&#xD;
South is ended !"&#xD;
.    .   .    .    .    .    0   .    .    0    0&#xD;
While Europe was thus pulling down and building up govern-&#xD;
ments, the Archduke Maximilan, with no active duties to per-&#xD;
form, had left Trieste, and had set out for a cruise in the Medi-&#xD;
terranean, with the intention of visiting the lands of which&#xD;
he had dreamed from his earliest childhood.&#xD;
Leaving behind him, the dusty tomes of classical scholars,&#xD;
turning from the hapless adventures of the unfortunate Ulysses,&#xD;
King of Ithaca, the Archduke began to- seek adventures of&#xD;
his own--began to live in earnest, and to feel within his soul&#xD;
the appeals for a high destiny in the future. This voyage, this&#xD;
journeying through ancient lands, whose men of might had once&#xD;
ruled the world, was to Maximilian a preparation of heart and&#xD;
soul; for, though young, already within him, lived the deter-&#xD;
ination to be a "hero in the strife." Nature had given him&#xD;

a strong, brave heart, a keen discrimination between right&#xD;
and wrong, a conscientious honor that bade him reject all save&#xD;
what was good and true. So panoplied, and armed, he pushed&#xD;
off from the Fatherland, and began his trial-trip on the voyage&#xD;
of life. May his vessel prove seaworthy !&#xD;
Count Victor Isolani, near his own age, a youth of noble&#xD;
parentage and noble nature, was the companion and confidant&#xD;
of the Archduke's hopes and fears.. To him, in wild enthusi-&#xD;
asm as they would stand at night upon the deck of their vessel,&#xD;
watching the play of the blue waters under the calm starlight,&#xD;
Maximilian would unfold the secret thoughts of his heart, the&#xD;
lofty ambition that dwelt within, and together they would&#xD;
dream of the lofty paths that, Faith stretched out for them in&#xD;
the future._. " The future, Isolani ! the future !" cried the Arch-&#xD;
duke one night as they occupied their usual positions on the&#xD;
bow of the vessel, " Thank God for the future !"&#xD;
" Amen," we say. Give us the future, that, with no part or&#xD;
being in the unpropitious present, never in coldness answers&#xD;
"Nay " to our pleadings ; never throws forward the fetters she&#xD;
holds to bind us, but bids us "look up," and. peer through the&#xD;
mist that hangs about us, and see our destiny. Only a smil-&#xD;
ing face it is,  one beautiful hand waving us onward, the other,&#xD;
holding aloft a glittering crown, whereon in golden letters&#xD;
we read our own name. Through the distance comes the soft&#xD;
whisper, "Earth-child, toil on, hope on, this is thy reward !"&#xD;
Upward we mount in our striving, and as we come nearer,&#xD;
nearer, -- higher, and still more high, rises the jeweled coronet.&#xD;
" You cannot reach it," says the cold voice of the Present at our&#xD;
side. " It will be thine, child, if thou art faithful ;" we hear&#xD;
the same sweet tones, coming from above. The strong heart&#xD;
faints not, but believing that loving promise, is drawn up-&#xD;
ward, upward,-till at last, leaving the earth behind, the mist&#xD;
dissolves, and purified, sanctified, passing the boundaries that&#xD;
shut in the kingdom, the earth-child is found worthy to be&#xD;
crowned, in the presence of the " Cherubim and Seraphim."&#xD;
So, even in his youth, did this vision haunt the mind of the&#xD;
Archduke Maximilian, and the dream of future greatness&#xD;
filling his soul, he began his toiling for the reward that Faith&#xD;
promises.&#xD;
As the Roman youth made pilgrimages to Greece and&#xD;
Athens, the Mecca of classic students, thither did the Archduke&#xD;

Past ; the air and heaven alone told of Futurity," and they&#xD;

upon the- summit of the Acropolis, where once stood the&#xD;
ancient citadel, the Archduke and Count Isolani paused and&#xD;
lingered amid the ruins of the Parthenon, the. magnificent struc-&#xD;
ture which, as their Palladium of safety, the home of their&#xD;
Virgin protectress, it had been the pride and delight of the&#xD;
Athenians to adorn.-&#xD;
" Do you remember, Isolani," said Maximilian, after gazing&#xD;
for some time at the mournful scene around - broken pillars,&#xD;
fallen arches, and crumbling stones - all that was left to tell of&#xD;
Minerva's temple; "do you remember the wonder and enthu-&#xD;
siasm with which we read of the honor and glory of this great&#xD;
city, as it was in the time of Pericles ! to whom Athens was&#xD;
indebted for edifices that should have remained eternal monu-&#xD;

devoted their lives to her service, look.now upon the fruit of&#xD;

your fancy from the misty Past, and send it forth into the&#xD;
Future. Tell us of what is- to come!"&#xD;
" Looking down," said Count Isolani, " far into the dim shad-&#xD;

own generation passed away ; another, and another has come and&#xD;
gone; until we, now the enlightened ones of the earth, are&#xD;

pIt seems to me," said the Archduke, as he and his compan-&#xD;
ion descended the slope of the Acropolis, and began to make&#xD;
their way back to the ancient city, "that if the destinies of a&#xD;
people were given to my keeping, I would lend my life to the&#xD;
task of forming a connecting link between myself and that peo-&#xD;
ple, so close, so intimate, that a stab in the heart of the one,&#xD;
should be felt in all its force, in that of the other."&#xD;
" And yet," said Count Isolani, " in the world, the true, devot.&#xD;

The Archduke and his companion lingered long upon a soil&#xD;
which to them was not degraded, though fallen, and these&#xD;
long strolls through groves eloquent with the voice of poesy,&#xD;
and of romance, had a wild, unearthly charm. It was an ideal&#xD;
life, that suited well the temperament of each, and they dreaded&#xD;
to say "Adieu," for each had caught the poet's ardor -&#xD;
"Cold is the heart, fair Greece ! that looks on thee,&#xD;
Nor feels as lovers o'er the dust they loved !"&#xD;
But at last, their bark floated over the Mediterannean, the&#xD;
ancient shores glimmered, and faded in the distance, and the&#xD;
gentle winds wafted them to Italy. And in Rome they began&#xD;
again their studies. In Rome ! Not the seat of Papal power,&#xD;
but Rome the Imperial Mistress, the City of the Cesars.&#xD;
Indulging in the vein of romance, which was his strong&#xD;
characteristic in youth, Maximilian desired not to destroy the&#xD;
illusion that hung over the ancient city, by noting and feeling&#xD;
the modern changes; but preferred to view it through the&#xD;
misty glamour of centuries. Though he yielded obedience to,&#xD;
and sought the blessing of, the Hioly Father, yet he lingered&#xD;
not so' miich about the Vatican, with its treasures of modern&#xD;
&#xD;
art, as amid the crumbling ruins, of ancient palaces and tem-&#xD;
ples.&#xD;
"Cypress and ivy, weed and wall-flower grown,&#xD;
Matted and massed together ; hillocks heaped&#xD;
on what were chambers, arch crush'd columns strown&#xD;
In fragments, chok'd up vaults, and frescos steep'd.&#xD;
In subterrannean damps, where the owl peep'd&#xD;
Deeming it midnight; temples, baths, or halls?&#xD;
Pronounce who can; for all that learning reap'd&#xD;
From her research hath been, that these are walls-&#xD;
Behold the Imperial MountI. 'tis thus the mighty falls."&#xD;
The poet's picture spake truth.     Of the forum, the gather-&#xD;
ing-place where orators harangued a stately people -      what is&#xD;
there, that has escaped the remorseless clutch of' time? Cast-&#xD;
ing the eye over the space it occupied between the Capitoline&#xD;
and Palatine hills, the beholder sees here, a falling pillar, there,'&#xD;
a broken arch, again a crumbling wall, and over all is brood-&#xD;
ing, a spirit of desolation. The palaces which saw the rival-&#xD;
ries, jealousies, loves, and nuptials of Roman emperors have&#xD;
shared the common fate. Even great Cesar's name has naught&#xD;
to tell of its former power. The Senate Chamber where the&#xD;
mighty conqueror fell, though consecrated by heroic blood-it,&#xD;
too has passed away.&#xD;
Aye, stricken by Time, pulseless and palsied, with all her&#xD;
sleeping dead gathered to her bosom, with all her deeds of&#xD;
greatness and her many crimes resting upon her memory,&#xD;
Rome shall waken never again at the bidding of man; the day&#xD;
of her glory has fled.&#xD;
Leaving Italy, Spain, with its Andalusian, Arragonese and&#xD;
Castilian peasantry, claimed attention from the travellers.&#xD;
Granada, living in song, filled with poetic souvenirs, with the&#xD;
Moorish palace of the Alhambra fraught with interest to all,&#xD;
had a double claim upon the Archduke, since here had been at&#xD;
one time, the home of his ancestor the great Charles the Fifth.&#xD;
The Alhambra was not alone eloquent with memories of the&#xD;
unfortunate Abencerrages, whose blood-stain is still upon the&#xD;
marble hall, and whose death was amply avenged in the down-&#xD;
fall of the: proud Boabdil, when in humility he yielded to&#xD;
another, and left the country where he had reigned a king ; as&#xD;
we are told in Moorish song,&#xD;
"There was crying in Granada when the sun was going down,&#xD;
Some calling on the Trinity, some calling on Mahoun.&#xD;
Here passed away the Koran -there in the Cross was borne,&#xD;
And here was heard the Christian bell, and there the Moorish horn."&#xD;

&#xD;
ber of Justice, the Hall of the Abencerrages -" familiar&#xD;
names, with old associations, that cling like cobwebs to the&#xD;
crumbling walls of the Alhambra, and, come up in succession&#xD;
to the gazer, softly and timidly, as lightly treading, fairy-footed&#xD;
day-dreams," these did not touch the heart of the Austrian&#xD;
prince- so deeply, and had not the charm for his soul, which&#xD;
invested the apartments where Charles the Great had dwelt&#xD;
with his unhappy mother, Queen Joan, whose mind, worn with&#xD;
grief at the loss of her husband, Philip the Handsome, cen-&#xD;
tred on her son.&#xD;
The ambitious heart of Prince Maximilian was stirred to&#xD;
its depths, as he remembered the greatness of the monarch,&#xD;
who united in himself the crowns of Germany, and of Spain.&#xD;
And the blood of this hero flowed in his veins ! Then en-&#xD;
tered the soul of the Prince a fixed purpose, that, though he&#xD;
might never sit upon a throne, he would in the world make for&#xD;
himself a high destiny. His days should not be passed in in-&#xD;
glorious ease. He would prove himself a worthy descendant&#xD;
of his illustrious Spanish ancestor. Yes, he, Maximilian,&#xD;
would add- another leaf to the crown of glory worn by the&#xD;
House of Hapsburg..&#xD;
The Archduke and Count Isolani bade Spain too, adieu, and&#xD;
again found themselves entering, after their long voyage and&#xD;
pilgrimage, the well-known harbor at Trieste, to resume their&#xD;
positions in the navy.&#xD;
The Archduke lent himself with good-will to the arduous&#xD;
duties of a seaman's life. The position held by Austria among&#xD;
the maritime powers was of necessity insignificant, and the&#xD;
few unseaworthy vessels of :war which constituted her navy&#xD;
bore the name more from courtesy than merit. But with the&#xD;
Archduke Maximilian, there entered into it a new and energetic&#xD;
spirit. He threw his whole soul into the work of its improve-&#xD;
ment. Dividing his residence between Trieste, and Venice, the&#xD;
principal harbors in the Austrian domain, he began the study&#xD;
of sea-faring, both theoretically. and. practically. Under his&#xD;
direction new ships were built, with all the recently discovered&#xD;
strong points. His warm, cordial, sailor-like bearing to those&#xD;
who were his companions and brother officers, won for him&#xD;
their unswerving devotion, which, as he was promoted from&#xD;
one position to another, merged itself into obedience. At the age&#xD;
of twenty-two, Maximilian was placed at the head of the Austrian&#xD;
navy, aind given entire control of the maritime department.&#xD;
From this time forward his residence was Trieste, and there, he&#xD;
&#xD;
labored, with all the energy of his nature, to make his minia-&#xD;
ture fleet all that " skill and invention could accomplish." In&#xD;
order to develop talent, and excite generous emulation among&#xD;
the sailors and officers, he sought out,-and promoted merit and&#xD;
gallantry wherever they were found, and he was soon surround-&#xD;
ed by men who, for ability and enterprise, could have superiors,&#xD;
nowhere.&#xD;
The labors of this earnest-working man were not in vain. In&#xD;
late years, when the struggle between Austria and Denmark&#xD;
came to the test at Lissa, it was the choice of sailors, the se-&#xD;
lection of the guiding hand firm and determined, that made the&#xD;
victory redound to the credit of Maximilian, though American&#xD;
waters rolled between him and his native land.&#xD;
In command of an admiral-ship in 1855, Maximilian, with&#xD;
his old love for travel, sailed for the Holy Land, where he spent&#xD;
some time visiting the consecrated shrines.&#xD;
He then proceeded to Egypt, where the ruins of Alexandria,&#xD;
of Memphis, the Pyramids, and above all the mighty Nile,&#xD;
were objects of absorbing interest, to his knowledge-loving&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
Returning to Vienna, the following 'year, now just twenty-&#xD;
four years of age, more than six feet in height, of command-&#xD;
ing appearance, splendid intellect, remarkably. cultivated and&#xD;
easy in manner, with a certain grace and polish in conversation.&#xD;
that made him wonderfully fascinating, the Archduke deter-&#xD;
mined upon the visits of policy to the European courts.' The&#xD;
first was to Napoleon, Emperor of France, and it was doubt-&#xD;
less during this visit at -St. Cloud that the young Prince im-&#xD;
pressed the royal monarch with his unusual abilities, and caused&#xD;
Napoleon to fix his eye upon him as the " man for the future."&#xD;
Leaving France, Maximilian proceeded to Brussels, where&#xD;
he was received with cordial kindness by King Leopold, whose&#xD;
esteem for the gallant Austrian admiral increased each day of&#xD;
his stay.&#xD;
During this visit, though limited to a few days, there was .a&#xD;
voice, never heard before, that spake unto his heart ; and its&#xD;
sweet tones softly swelled in depth and power, till in mighty&#xD;
cadence it filled his whole soul with melody. It was the voice&#xD;
of Love ; the hand of Love that led him into her temple, and&#xD;
whispered the name of the vestal virgin that ministered there--&#xD;
the " Princss Carlotta !" and the Archduke knelt before the&#xD;
altar, and in silence laid his own heart thereon, an offering.&#xD;
The Princess Carlotta of Belgium was but sixteen years of&#xD;

&#xD;
age, a beautiful, cultivated maiden of splendid mental endow-&#xD;
ments and unusual attainments as a scholar; at the. same time&#xD;
wanting in none of the gentler, and softer attributes that render&#xD;
the weaker sex so charming. Deprived of a mother's tender&#xD;
care, almost in her infancy, she. had grown up the constant&#xD;
companion of her royal father, whose love for his only daugh-&#xD;
ter was filled with tenderness and solicitude, and he had himself&#xD;
taken special care in the .selection of her teachers; so that,&#xD;
even at thisage, her accomplishments were by no, means insig-&#xD;
nificant. In the Princess Carlotta, Maximilian saw his ideal&#xD;
of maidenly beauty and refinement, and he needed no second&#xD;
revelation to tell him that she was the one to whom he would&#xD;
gladly yield his future destiny.&#xD;
He bore from Brussels the impress of that angel face, the&#xD;
memory of the one who had opened the fountain in-his heart,&#xD;
and he knew that the time must come, when her love should&#xD;
be the brightest ray of sunlight across his path.&#xD;
Passing through Holland and North Germany, lingering&#xD;
amid the beautiful scenery that Edenizes, the banks of the&#xD;
softly flowing Rhine, the Archduke at last returned to Vienna,&#xD;
having learned at least one lesson, that should last him through&#xD;
life, and whose teachings would guide him to weal or woe.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
&#xD;
SSOL ANI," said the Archduke to his friend, some months&#xD;
after his return from Germany, when the two were to-&#xD;
gether on a visit to Vienna, and were enjoying an&#xD;
afternoon drive on the Prater, "do you think an am-&#xD;
bitious man should ever marry ? that is, when he has no pur-&#xD;
pose to secure, but marries, as the old ballad has it, 'all for&#xD;
love'?"&#xD;
- "Has a subject of such grave and vital importance at last&#xD;
presented itself for consideration ? " replied} Count Isolani,&#xD;
smiling. " Let us hear all before we commit ourselves, your&#xD;
Highness, by expressing an opinion. Never having felt the&#xD;
tender passion ourselves, of course our answer would be per-&#xD;
&#xD;
fectly impartial. Let us hear ; has the sight of a beautiful face&#xD;
in Venice, in Trieste, in France, or in Vienna here, impressed&#xD;
you with the truth of the charge, 'it is not good for man to&#xD;
be alone'? "&#xD;
"IIa !" exclaimed Maximilian, "if I did not know you so&#xD;
well, I should be willing to declare that you have no heart or-&#xD;
ganically ; you are so impassive, Isolani! If one is proof against&#xD;
the maidens of the places you have mentioned, then there is&#xD;
no hope for them. But come now, let's be serious. You have&#xD;
always been my confidant, Isolani, and I am -going to open a&#xD;
window of my heart, that I have kept shut even from you, for&#xD;
a good many months."&#xD;
" Ah, ah ! " said Count Isolani, a -smile still playing on his&#xD;
handsome face; "you have in truth an afaire du cceur, and&#xD;
you have 'kept it from us so long ! " he added reproachfully.&#xD;
" I trust I may be able to return the favor before a great while."&#xD;
" Is it prudent to reveal the heart's workings to another, even&#xD;
though that other be a second self, - as I confess you to be,&#xD;
Isolani - before it has scarcely dared to whisper its purpose to&#xD;
itself ?  But I am going to make a clean sweep of the whole&#xD;
matter this afternoon. Come ! let's turn into this avenue to&#xD;
the right. It looks quiet; and we shall perhaps not be dis-&#xD;
turbed."&#xD;
They entered a long, shady avenue of beautiful elms, stretch-&#xD;
ing on in a green vista, and leading across a rustic bridge, that&#xD;
seemed to have been placed by Nature over a deep ravine,&#xD;
through' which a tiny stream rushed along to pour its little&#xD;
current into the rolling waters of the Danube.&#xD;
Maximilian was right; there was no prospect of their being&#xD;
disturbed if they followed this road, for this little dell was not&#xD;
a parade or show place, and few came to the Priter for retire-&#xD;
ment or seclusion.&#xD;
" Well, my friend," said Count Isolani, as he gave the reins&#xD;
to the handsome horses and let them take a more quiet pace,&#xD;
"I am all attention. Tell me how it all began; when and&#xD;
where love gave the rose4int to all your dreams."&#xD;
" To be short: it was the past autumn, during my visit to&#xD;
King Leopold, at the Court of Belgium, that I aw the Princess&#xD;
Carlotta, his only daughter. She was a timid maiden of but&#xD;
sixteen years, just budding into beautiful womanhood. During&#xD;
bny stay in Brussels, I was thrown not.a great deal with her,&#xD;
and yet enough to discover that she possessed a mind as accom-&#xD;
plished, as her person was elegant, and a heart as deep and full&#xD;

&#xD;
of feeling as though she had heard naught of the world's&#xD;
policy. Until I saW her, my mind was fully decided that I&#xD;
would never marry; for you know, Isolani, what matters of&#xD;
convenience royal marriages usually are ; but I came away from&#xD;
Brussels with my resolution shaken.' II went to Trieste, deter-&#xD;
mined to say nothing of the impress she had made upon my&#xD;
heart to any one, not even to you -for I thought, and even&#xD;
hoped, it would wear away ; but as the weeks and months pass,&#xD;
I find that 'human love is not the growth of human will,' and&#xD;
something draws my thoughts, my aspirations, my future, all in&#xD;
one direction. I can draw no picture, but she seems to be the&#xD;
spirit that breathes life and reality into it. You see, Isolani,&#xD;
how the case stands ! "&#xD;
" Ah, yes," cried Count Isolani, half laughing; "the diagno-&#xD;
sis is quickly given; and though I dislike exceedingly to pre-&#xD;
scribe the remedy, for it may be in the end, my individual loss,&#xD;
yet there is but one !"&#xD;
"And that, of course, is marriage? Yes, here I am, in spite&#xD;
of all my resolutions, in spite of all my declarations against it&#xD;
drifting headlong into the same current that has wrecked so&#xD;
many ! You know me, Isolani, better, perhaps, than any one&#xD;
else; do you think that I am worthy to take into my keeping&#xD;
the happiness of a true, devoted woman? for, with me, the&#xD;
question whether the Princess Carlotta will regard my suit with&#xD;
favor, is not the only one. There is another, that comes up, to&#xD;
me often and often: 'What preparation of heart and soul is&#xD;
necessary for a man, to become a proper companion for a Chris-&#xD;
tian woman?' for, before God, Isolani, I would not blight the&#xD;
happiness, nor mildew the life of a woman that treads the earth.&#xD;
The glances of court-dames, and demoiselles hav'n't troubled&#xD;
my heart much heretofore, and I feel that the love I offer the&#xD;
Princess Carlotta is fresh and pure."&#xD;
"And you have made up your mind fully to offer her this&#xD;
love, your Highness? "  asked Count Isolani, looking up.&#xD;
" Well, I can only say that the Princess Carlotta is blessed.&#xD;
And who is to be your ambassador, your Highness ?"&#xD;
" I thought to ask Count Arquinto to be the royal ambassa-&#xD;
dor to King Leopold ; and to beg you, Isolani, to accept the&#xD;
heart's mission to the princess."&#xD;
" I,-your Highness ? I, am but a poor representative, with,&#xD;
perhaps, only one shining quality -and that, I trust, is sin-&#xD;
cerity; but if I can do aught to further your. happiness, may&#xD;
services are at your disposal."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Thank you a thousand times, Isolani ! But listen to a little&#xD;
more, and then I won't worry you with this sentimentalism&#xD;
any more this afternoon. King Leopold may reply favorably&#xD;
to my suit from reasons of policy; but I could not lead his&#xD;
daughter to* the altar, unless I felt that her heart dictated the&#xD;
words of the vows that made us one. It is now May, Isolani; I.&#xD;
can readily obtain for you a leave of absence from Trieste, from&#xD;
the first of June, for a couple months. Will you go then to&#xD;
Brussels with Count Arquinto, and present to the Princess&#xD;
Carlotta a miniature that I shall send?  Count Arquinto will&#xD;
return ; but will you remain until he goes to make the last&#xD;
preparations, and if King Leopold's answer should be favorable,&#xD;
test the Princess Carlotta's heart, as you will have opportunity&#xD;
at the palace? Study her character, and before it is too late,&#xD;
let me know the truth - whether she is willing to marry the&#xD;
Archduke of Austria simply, or Ferdinand Maximilian. Will&#xD;
you accept the mission, Isolani? Believe me, there is not an-&#xD;
other that I would trust so far ! "&#xD;
Count Isolani was silent for a few moments; and when he&#xD;
spoke, it was hardly in tones so light and cheery as before.&#xD;
" It is indeed a difficult, or rather a delicate, task you have set&#xD;
me, my friend," he said, " and I hardly fbel myself competent;&#xD;
yet I cannot refuse to serve you anywhere, or in any capacity.&#xD;
Arrange things as you will, and when you need me, command&#xD;
me ; only promise, that, however I may- act in fulfilling your&#xD;
mission, you will not doubt my truth and fidelity to your-&#xD;
self?"&#xD;
"Never! " said the Archduke; " and may I be able to serve&#xD;
you in a like cause," he added, smiling, as Isolani heaved a sigh.&#xD;
"But, as I said, you are so irkpassive, that I am afraid there is&#xD;
no crystal fountain in your nature. We must go over to Trieste&#xD;
in a couple of. days, and arrange for your absence. See! here&#xD;
we are in the crowd again, and 'tout le monde' is bearing&#xD;
homeward, and perhaps we had best go that way too, for it's&#xD;
growing chilly."&#xD;
They left the Prater, and turned in the direction of Schon-&#xD;
brunn, which was now the Imperial residence.&#xD;
The two were unusually silent. Count Isolani was thinking&#xD;
zf the new phase his friend's life had taken, a little regretfully,&#xD;
perhaps; not all unmixed with envy, for he pictured himself&#xD;
deprived of the genial companionship that had been such a joy.&#xD;
ie wondered if he should ever dream this dream of love -&#xD;
whether, in truth, "there's nothing half so sweet in life;" and&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
" RING OUT THE MARRIAGE BELLS! o"&#xD;
&#xD;
HE wedding-day of the Princess Carlotta was a high&#xD;
holiday in Brussels. Though the people did not par-&#xD;
ticipate in, or witness the august ceremonies at the&#xD;
palace chapel, where the rites were performed, yet their&#xD;
hearts caught the feeling of joy; and they sought in every way -&#xD;
by decorating with suspended tapestry their houses, by raising&#xD;
in the park triumphal arches, wreathed. with garlands of fresh&#xD;
flowers; by closing their business houses, and appearing on the&#xD;
principal streets, in their gayest, brightest attire-to testify their&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JEWELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
43'&#xD;
&#xD;
with a hopeful sigh that, perhaps, there might be some one, com-&#xD;
ing to meet him, and he might be going onward to meet her,until&#xD;
their paths should unite, and they should walk together in hap-&#xD;
piness, he brushed the shadow from his brow, and determined&#xD;
within himself to do all he cold for his friend.&#xD;
And Maximilian? He was thinking of life, was picturing it&#xD;
through that rosy atmosphere that Love's hand alone can give.&#xD;
Imbued with the same spirit of poetry and romance that, in&#xD;
the early ages, gave birth to German idealism, he. saw every&#xD;
event of life through a higher medium than those who make&#xD;
utility their lens. The spirit of the hero, which was Nature's&#xD;
dower to him, had been fostered and cultivated by his travels,&#xD;
at that period of life when the heart of youth cherishes with&#xD;
loving admiration the memory of fallen .warriors. With&#xD;
an exalted idea of Christian heroism and chivalry, love was&#xD;
with him a grand passion, high and holy,-not simply the&#xD;
chanting of erotic strains, evanescent and changing ; but it&#xD;
was the enthusiastic, poetic sentiment of devotion, such as the&#xD;
Christian knights entertained for those whose names were in-&#xD;
scribed upon their shields. To him, " woman was the compan-&#xD;
ion, the consoler of man; his counsel in difficulty, in sorrow&#xD;
his guardian angel."&#xD;
Happy the moment that led him to the Princess Carlotta !&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
love for their Princess, and their good wishes for her future&#xD;
happiness.&#xD;
The royal palace was the scene of elegant magnificence. The&#xD;
Princess Carlotta bore the name of the English wife who had&#xD;
been so dear to King Leopold's heart, and the affection which&#xD;
he entertained for his daughter was of no ordinary type.&#xD;
Though he trusted implicitly the guardian to whom he was&#xD;
about to yield this jewel of his heart, yet the sacrifice was still&#xD;
painful; and though he directed that naught should be spared&#xD;
to make the wedding a brilliant occasion, his heart turned with&#xD;
bitterness from the contemplation of the departure that would&#xD;
follow. The court chapel, festooned with garlands; the pillars,&#xD;
trimmed with wreaths of roses; the chancel, decorated with&#xD;
the same floral offerings; the altar-cloth of rich white.,velvet,&#xD;
embroidered with gold, and bordered with heavy bullion fringe;&#xD;
the stately chairs, with their rich mountings, -all lent an air&#xD;
of courtly magnificence, rather than of religious devotion, to the&#xD;
place; and, as the beams of the morning sun stole in through&#xD;
the stained-glass windows, and flooded the aisles with a rich,&#xD;
golden light, the stern gaze of the old saints on the darkly&#xD;
frescoed walls seemed to soften, their solemn faces light up&#xD;
with a subdued smile that, perhaps, they had sometimes worn on&#xD;
earth, there was naught lacking to complete the dreamy beauty&#xD;
and solemnity, of the scene.&#xD;
At an early hour, the honored guests, the lords and ladies of&#xD;
the nobility, began to arrive, and the chapel was rapidly filled.&#xD;
At last, the hour for the marriage was announced by the distant&#xD;
firing of guns; and a hush of expectation ran through the as-&#xD;
sembly, as from behind the altar came the archbishop and four&#xD;
other bishops wearing silver tiaras, flowing robes and mantles&#xD;
in richness, suited to their rank. These, taking their places&#xD;
before the altar, were followed by an array of priests bearing&#xD;
lighted candles, vessels of holy water, and the sacred book -&#xD;
adjuncts of the solemn Cathblic ceremony.&#xD;
And now, down the aisle, came the, grand chamberlain of&#xD;
the royal household, and the various court officials, and range&#xD;
themselves in their respective places on either side of the altar.&#xD;
Then came the Princess' brothers, the Duke de Brabant and&#xD;
the Count do Flandre, the former a noble-looking young Prince&#xD;
of twenty-two years, and the latter two years his junior. Each&#xD;
knelt on the steps of the chancel, before the archbishop, and&#xD;
kissed the cross, while the Father touched their brows with&#xD;
holy water.&#xD;

&#xD;
And now, followed by the members of the escort which had&#xD;
accompanied him from Vienna, comes the royal bridegroom, the&#xD;
Archduke Maximilian of Austria. Though recently appointed&#xD;
Viceroy over the Lombardo-Venetian provinces in Italy, he still&#xD;
wears the magnificent uniform of an Austrian admiral, and as&#xD;
- he walks proudly up the aisle, he seems indeed one born to&#xD;
command everywhere respect, admiration, and love. The Arch-&#xD;
duke bows himself in obeisance before the altar, and, while&#xD;
kissing the golden cross, receives upon his brow the signet of a&#xD;
true Catholic.-&#xD;
There is a, rustling of silken robes, and the Princess&#xD;
Carlotta enters, leaning upon the arm of her august father.&#xD;
Upon her brow rests a tiara of glittering diamonds, graceful as&#xD;
a wreath of orange-flowers, and a brooch of the same precious&#xD;
stones flashes upon her bosom; while the rich robe of white&#xD;
silk, threaded with silver and almost covered with finest lace,&#xD;
sweeps into.an ample train, borne by her royal attendants, who&#xD;
are followed by the maids.of honor.-&#xD;
The beautiful bride kneels beside her father before the arch-&#xD;
bishop, who presents the cross to her lips, and as she rises, her&#xD;
youthful face is slightly flushed with excitement, but in her eye&#xD;
"beams confident the hope of future happiness."&#xD;
And now the archbishop begins the ceremony of the matri-&#xD;
monial coronation, as the bride and bridegroom stand before&#xD;
him, by the intonation of a psalm; each verse consecrated by&#xD;
the choir in the glorious paean, " Glory be to Thee, our God;&#xD;
glory be to Thee'!"S&#xD;
The ceremony is continued, with solemn prayers and pledges,&#xD;
with the sprinkling of holy water, and the bridal-ring, in the&#xD;
sight of God and man "in the name of the Father, of the Son,&#xD;
and the Holy Ghost" the royal couple are made one; and the&#xD;
vows "for better or for worse" rest upon the souls of the&#xD;
Archduke Maximilian and the Archduchess Carlotta.&#xD;
From the organ loft the glad " Te Deum!" rings out, the&#xD;
guests offer their congratulations, and in the distance the loud-&#xD;
mouthed cannon echoes "Amen ! "     S&#xD;
The wedding breakfast is over ; the guests depart ; and the&#xD;
day passing swiftly on, brings the afternoon hours. The park,&#xD;
which we have seen before in half.quietude, wears now a different&#xD;
look. Triumphal arches, decorated with flowers, and mounted&#xD;
in the centre with the cross-flags of Austria and Belgium wav-&#xD;
ing in the breeze, are seen at every turn of the carriage-way;-&#xD;
while the smooth green lawns are thronged with citizens of all&#xD;
&#xD;
sexes and ages, who have come hither to catch a glimpse of the&#xD;
bride and her noble husband.&#xD;
As the royal carriage enters the gate, and rolls along the&#xD;
gravel, between the living avenues of people, who press forward,&#xD;
and peer with anxious glance to see the Princess in her bridal&#xD;
attire, and to see ." what manner of man " the Archduke Maxi-&#xD;
milian is; as the carriage rolls on under the flowery arches,&#xD;
the shout from the vast multitude goes up as one voice, "Long&#xD;
live the Archduchess Carlotta ! Long live the Archduke Max-&#xD;
imilian!" Again and again, rising and falling in mighty cadence,&#xD;
the cry goes up, until at last the carriage, stopping in front of&#xD;
the music pavilion where the "Band of the Guides," is assem-&#xD;
bled for the. afternoon's musical entertainment, the Archduke&#xD;
rises from his seat to make acknowledgment for the enthusi-&#xD;
astic greeting to the Archduchess and himself.&#xD;
In a moment all is hushed, and every eye is directed to the&#xD;
Prince, who stands there in his Austrian uniform, his head un-&#xD;
covered, and the light hair pushed back, revealing his high,&#xD;
-open forehead.&#xD;
Belgians !" said he, in a voice clear and distinct, but full of&#xD;
deep, earnest feeling, "one year ago, I came to your court a&#xD;
stranger, known only as an Austrian prince, the guest of your&#xD;
august sovereign; then I looked upon your honest faces for&#xD;
the first time. A happy fate has thrown me again in your&#xD;
midst, and I trust that I need no other passport to your heart,&#xD;
than the name.of the Princess Carlotta ! You have given me&#xD;
this day, the fairest flower that blooms in your kingdom. God&#xD;
being my helper, you shall never regret the trust ; and may it&#xD;
be remembered, when we go from your midst, that wherever&#xD;
destiny guides us, the Archduke Maximilian owes to Belgium&#xD;
the deepest debt of gratitude the heart of man can know!"&#xD;
Again the shouts go up; now with double force, "Long&#xD;
livethe noble Archduke Maximilian; long live the lovely Car-&#xD;
lotta# !"&#xD;
The tumult of joy is hushed again, as from the pavilion&#xD;
come the strong, full notes of the German national air. The&#xD;
crowd moves to and fro about the Park in unrestrained enjoyment,&#xD;
their souls filled with music, their hearts with happiness. Listen-&#xD;
to the melody that floats m. the atmosphere, as piece after&#xD;
piece is given with wonderful power by the band, the people for-&#xD;
get that tlhe royal carriage has left the park, forget that the&#xD;
daylight is gone and the twilight is commg; until at last they.&#xD;

are casting shadows on the green, and they hurry home in the&#xD;
moonlight, wondering when such another day will come.&#xD;
The Archduke and Archduchess left .Brussels in two days&#xD;
for Vienna, from whence, after a short visit to the royal family&#xD;
of Austria, they would pass on to Italy, whither the Archduke's&#xD;
duties as Viceroy called him.&#xD;
The court had left the imperial palace at Vienna for Schon-&#xD;
brunn, just without the city, the birth-place, not only of Maxi-&#xD;
milian, but of most of the princes of his house since the time&#xD;
*  of Maria Theresa, by whom the palace was built.&#xD;
The Archduchess Carlotta was received at Sch~nbrunn by&#xD;
the royal family with the utmost tenderness and kindness.&#xD;
Though the rejoicings at Vienna were 4ot conducted with the&#xD;
same delight among the populace, there was naught lacking to&#xD;
make the Archduchess, feel that she was gladly welcomed to the&#xD;
Austrian heart.&#xD;
It was with great joy that the Princess found herself at last in&#xD;
the quiet of her own chamber at Schonbrunn. The apartments&#xD;
assigned to the royal pair during their stay in Austria, were&#xD;
adorned with elegance and taste. An exquisite boudoir, sepa-&#xD;
rated from the ,private chamber by dark, graceful curtains,&#xD;
was rich in Venetian mirrors, gilded candelabras, luxurious&#xD;
divans, and soft-cushioned ottomans. A magnificent piano,&#xD;
inlaid with pearl, filled one recess, and the walls were adorned&#xD;
with beautiful paintings, for which it was known that the Arch-&#xD;
duchess had an absorbing fondness. An arched doorway, or&#xD;
long window led into an open balcony, filled with rare and aro-&#xD;
matic flowers.&#xD;
It was but a week after her arrival at Schonbrunn, and the&#xD;
day before their departure for Italy, that the Archduchess sat&#xD;
alone in her boudoir, enjoying the quiet to which of late&#xD;
she had become such a stranger.     _&#xD;
Just two weeks had passed-how short a period !-and yet&#xD;
with the concentrated life of years, in those fleeting hours, since&#xD;
in her father's palace she had heard the greeting of the one who&#xD;
was now her husband. She remembered so well the smile&#xD;
Maximilian had given her, as he softly whispered of his love,&#xD;
and their future. "Was this the ideal lover? " ffr since she&#xD;
first saw him, more than a year ago, she had idealized him into&#xD;
more than man -this the Prince of whom she had been dream-&#xD;
ing through so many months ?&#xD;
Aye, her ideal hiad paled and vanished into insignificance&#xD;
before the true hero, as she saw him now, who, with those po.-&#xD;
&#xD;
CRO WY JEWELS.             47&#xD;
&#xD;
tent words of the ancient Roman, had held her heart cap-&#xD;
tive.&#xD;
The Archduchess had risen from her seat, and in her musing&#xD;
almost unconscious of her action, had stepped out into the bal-&#xD;
cony, and while looking down at the towers and steeples of&#xD;
Vienna in the distance, plucked a sprig of scarlet geranium&#xD;
from the stand at her side.&#xD;
. A spirit of love seemed to hover about her, and "filled the&#xD;
air and all around with beauty."&#xD;
" Carlotta ! "&#xD;
She heard her name murmured in soft, loving accents, and&#xD;
turning, beheld Maximilian standing just within the win.&#xD;
dow.&#xD;
He held his arms out towards her, and his eyes, bent upon&#xD;
her in admiration and love, seemed to woo her to his em-&#xD;
brace.&#xD;
" Why have you stolen from me, little Princess ? Am I not&#xD;
now to be the sharer of your 'time and thoughts, and have I&#xD;
not been kept away from you enough already, by this jubil-&#xD;
ate that greets us everywhere? After all, there are inconvenien-&#xD;
ces in royalty, that, however Cupid rebels against them, hold&#xD;
him fast."&#xD;
The Archduchess stood-in the balcony a step above her hus-&#xD;
band, and the setting sun threw around her a halo of glory, and&#xD;
lit up her face with an unearthly brightness. Drooping about&#xD;
her rounded, girlish figure in graceful folds, a soft fleecy India&#xD;
muslin gave an ethereal-like being to the Princess; while the&#xD;
brooch of pearl at her throat clasped the spray of scarlet geran-&#xD;
ium flowers she had plucked, and the tiny stars of an Arabian&#xD;
jessamine peeped out of the masses of dark hair. -&#xD;
As the Archduke gazed upon her, his heart seemed written&#xD;
on his face, and upon his brow happiness had stamped her&#xD;
seal.&#xD;
"Ah ! then you have felt that, Maximilian?" said Carlotta,&#xD;
half sadly, as he finished speaking.&#xD;
" Shall I answer the question that is trembling in your heart,&#xD;
Carlotta?" whispered Maximilian. "Yes," for I too must ask it:&#xD;
did Cupid rebel when your hand was placed in mine?  I am&#xD;
willing to trust the words that crowd upon me for utterance;&#xD;
nay, willing to ti-ust my actions, which do but shadow forth the&#xD;
inner man, to speak for me;. but you, Carlotta, have been&#xD;
silent:. I have heard no'love greeting in return."&#xD;
For a moment a flush~ overspread the .face of the Princess;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
but then, turning her face up to the Archduke, with a light&#xD;
laugh, she exclaimed, -&#xD;
" And was not Count Isolani's message enough for your&#xD;
Highness?"&#xD;
"Isolani! God bless him," said the Archduke, smiling. "He&#xD;
was true to his trust. Was ever woman in such manner won?&#xD;
But Isolani and I have both your forgiveness ? the 'end sanc&#xD;
tifies the means'? Isolani! poor fellow ! If he was only here to&#xD;
wish us joy; but he left Trieste a month ago, sent on a cruise to&#xD;
Africa -will perhaps be gone two years. I wish he could be with&#xD;
us in Italy; but the sea is the life for a sailor ; even I, long to&#xD;
get back again."&#xD;
" Tell me, Maximilian," said Carlotta, " something of your&#xD;
sailor-life and your home at Trieste."&#xD;
"My home at Trieste ; Miramar? " replied the Archduke&#xD;
eagerly, as he led her to a divan within.  "Ah !if we could but&#xD;
go to Miramar before we go hence to Italy. Shall I bring up&#xD;
the poet's picture, -&#xD;
-" 'A deep vale,&#xD;
Shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world,&#xD;
Near a clear lake, margined by fruits of gold&#xD;
And whisperingmyrtles: glassing softest skies&#xD;
As cloudless, save with rare and roseate shadows&#xD;
As I would have thy fate  -&#xD;
A palace, lifting to eternal summer,&#xD;
Its marble walls from out a glossy bower&#xD;
Of coolest foliage, musical with birds ;'&#xD;
"A   home for a Sybarite! But you, Carlotta, are a sailor's&#xD;
wife, and must live where the soulid of old ocean,in its ceaseless,&#xD;
surging flow, is the answering voice of the soul's companion.&#xD;
Miramar is a palace after my own heart, situate, not in an&#xD;
Eden plain, but on a wild rocky promontory, where Nature seemed&#xD;
to sit enthroned, claiming it as her own, and defying Art to take it&#xD;
from her. Under my own supervision, the castle was begun only&#xD;
a few years since; and now, you can stand onthe stone balconies,&#xD;
or down-in the garden amid the flowers, and look far away at&#xD;
the white-crested waves of the Adriatic ; or, turning, descry in&#xD;
the distance the cloud-capped heights of the mighty Alps.&#xD;
There, Carlotta, when the world is done with us, and our duties&#xD;
are performed, is to be our home, the retreat and abiding place&#xD;
of happiness ! ".&#xD;
The Archduchess had listened with eager attention to this&#xD;
picture. of her future home, and her eyes now rested in admira.&#xD;
tion upon her husband.-.     -&#xD;
&#xD;
" It is a mystery I cannot solve, Maximilian," she said at last,&#xD;
"how it is that you bear the onus of belonging to the tabooed&#xD;
sect of ' woman-haters ;' you, whose appreciation of all that is&#xD;
beautiful in nature and art is so high, and who have so little&#xD;
of the cynic about you."&#xD;
A laugh from the Archduke met her question.&#xD;
" Then, because I've been no ' cooing Tannhauser.;' because I&#xD;
have not frittered away the precious years of my young manhood&#xD;
in attendance upon court dames and demoiselles; because I have&#xD;
striven to keep my heart above the effervescing, volatile passions&#xD;
of youth ; have endeavored to refine and perfect my whole na-&#xD;
ture, so that I might make both heart and hand a worthy offer-&#xD;
ing to a noble woman, - I have forsooth won for myself the un-&#xD;
amiable soubriquet of 'woman-hater '!  No, Carlotta ; you are&#xD;
right. I am indeed no cynic, but I have a contempt, which I&#xD;
have never sought to disguise, for those who can content them-&#xD;
selves to be but the froth of the sea, never dreaming that the river&#xD;
of time is drifting them on to the boundless ocean of eternity;&#xD;
never turning from the pleasure, the sunshine of to-day, to&#xD;
think that there may be clouds and storms to-morrow. Such&#xD;
men and such women I do most heartily pity, and cordially&#xD;
despise! *But give me the man or woman, peasant, or Princess,&#xD;
who, while adorning the circle in which God has placed them&#xD;
can still, when the storms come, stand up bravely, and looking&#xD;
up undaunted, say, with the faith of s true heart, 'If I cannot&#xD;
escape, I can endure,'- give me his hand, and let me call him&#xD;
'Brother'! We must learn, Carlotta, as' far as in our power&#xD;
lies, the great purpose of God in the creation of man, if he&#xD;
would be great in the future. To live for His gfor is to live for&#xD;
our own; and the influence that strengthens us or the task, is&#xD;
Love. Yes, love ; love of the good and the true, wherever'it is&#xD;
found; for we are raised from the contemplation of these attri-&#xD;
butes in things animate or inanimate, to the One, the great Crea-&#xD;
tor, who is the embodiment' of Wisdom, Goodness, and Truth.&#xD;
Love elevates the souls of men and women, for it kindles the&#xD;
spark of divinity that lies in the heart, smould'ering beneath&#xD;
the ashes of mortality. Have I not~read you a sermon, though&#xD;
I am afraid Jeremy Taylor or Hooker would hardly accept it as&#xD;
orthodox ?"&#xD;
Carlotta smiled. "Stay," she said, "you have not finished&#xD;
Hope is Love's companion; but what do 'you do with earthly&#xD;
ambition; is it not one of the powerful agencies in~the eleva-&#xD;
tion of men ? .Did not Bonaparte have both love and ambi-&#xD;

" Bonaparte was great ; and if his goodness of heart had but&#xD;
equalled his ambition, he would have been god-like. Ambition&#xD;
is right ; it does elevate men's souls when it is not brought to&#xD;
the earth. That soul-annihilating principle that clings to self,&#xD;
first and last, always works its own ruin.. You remember Car-&#xD;
dinal Wolsey's requiem over his own destiny:&#xD;
"'Farewell ! a long farewell to all my greatness !&#xD;
This is the state of man : to-day he puts forth .&#xD;
The tender leaves of hope ; to-morrow blossoms,&#xD;
And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;&#xD;
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost :&#xD;
- And - when he thinks, good, easy man, full surely,&#xD;
His greatness is a-ripening -nips isroot,&#xD;
And then, he falls, aslIdo!"I&#xD;
Maximilian's deep, full voice gave unwonted impress to the&#xD;
truthful words ; and listening to the rich melody, one might&#xD;
have dreamed it to be the spirit of poetry, improvising and&#xD;
giving to man the beautiful teachings of a divine philosophy.&#xD;
The palace clock struck seven, and eight was the hour for the&#xD;
reunion in the drawing-room of the palace. The Archduke rose,&#xD;
and drawing the Archduchess to the, window he whispered,&#xD;
" My darling, to-morrow we leave this palace to go out into&#xD;
the world, to build there our temple. We each pray that it may&#xD;
be strong and enduring; and I read in your eyes that it must&#xD;
go upward, upward, very high.    Shall we not inscribe upon its&#xD;
dome the magic words, Love, Truth, and Ambition ? Love&#xD;
first. And may I give-you my definition of this goddess, as I&#xD;
see her, and know her ?  An ethereal being she is, whose pres-&#xD;
ence illumines everything -the lowly valley and the lofty moun-&#xD;
tain ; to those who see her by the eye of faith, every cloud&#xD;
is gilded that floats across the horizon and shadows human&#xD;
life. An inbreathing power she sends into the hearts of men,&#xD;
that gives them strength to do whatever is, to be done, speaks&#xD;
and acts for them, and.sends them  forth to conquer ; aye, she&#xD;
binds together humanity with golden links, for though, her&#xD;
mission leads her oft to palace halls, yet she .disdains not to&#xD;
dwell with the simplest peasant maiden, and truly,&#xD;
"'Lays the shepherd's crook&#xD;
Beside the sceptre.'&#xD;
"Aye, love breathes over all nature," continued the Arch-&#xD;
duke, as he looked out upon the beautiful landscape, where the&#xD;

cRo WN JEWELS.                       51&#xD;
shadows lay so calma and still, " an ineffable atmosphere of joy,&#xD;
that happiness approaches only as moonlight approaches the&#xD;
sunbeam, that brightens, intensifies, and glorifies life itself.&#xD;
"'iFlowers laugh before her on their beds,&#xD;
And fragrance in her footing treads ;&#xD;
She doth preserve the stars fromwrong,&#xD;
And the eternal heavens through her are fresh and strong.'&#xD;
"Tell me, Carlotta, before I go, does your heart echo my&#xD;
words? Has your soul felt this presence, as mine has? "&#xD;
Carlotta lifted up her dark eyes, so full of feeling, to the&#xD;
Archduke's face, while she answered softly,-&#xD;
" You have shaped into words the greeting of my soul to&#xD;
this angel visitor, who dwells now in the secret chambers of my&#xD;
heart, chanting there in heavenly melody her holiest songs of&#xD;
joy.,'&#xD;
Maxiiilian bent, and imprinted a kiss upon her brow, and&#xD;
as he bade her adieu- for to him, a moment away from her&#xD;
seemed an age - whispered, " We are one, Carlotta, in thought,&#xD;
feeling, and action ; no shadow of doubt nor spirit of evil&#xD;
fancy can take away the faith, trust, and devotion which fills&#xD;
our souls. We ueed not fear the future, for with such helpers&#xD;
we can disarm or conquer fate."&#xD;
Aye, they were being prepared, by the forging of links by an&#xD;
unseen hand that bound them together and strengthened them,&#xD;
for their future work. Triple-armed with love, truth, and am-&#xD;
bition, to which was added faith, can they fail to act well their&#xD;
part in the drama of life ?&#xD;
And so they left Schinbrunn and went to Italy -went forth&#xD;
for the first time together, to fight the battles : she, to cheer, to&#xD;
comfort, and console; and he, with such inspiration, -to con-&#xD;

&#xD;
LONG and earnest gaze at the spouse of the Adriatic,&#xD;
" rising with her tiara of proud towers ! "&#xD;
U        Venice ! Poetry's home ! Like a dream she rises be-&#xD;
fore us, " throned on her hundred isles ; " each marble&#xD;
palace, each narrow arch, eloquent with stories of the past. The&#xD;
low plashing of her gondolas, as beneath the moonlit sky, they&#xD;
float over the watery streets, seems to whisper of her dead poet,&#xD;
the "'echoes of whose songs are no more heard," but the memory&#xD;
of whose greatness is not "writ in water ; " for while the names&#xD;
of Tasso, gifted son of Genius; of Shakespeare, bard of Avon,&#xD;
stand upon the enduring record which Time has given to im '&#xD;
mortality, Venice, with her Bridge of Sighs and her Rialto,&#xD;
cannot'be forgotten; and these will live in the hearts of men&#xD;
when the marble palaces and stately towers that look down&#xD;
upon the Grand Canal, crumbling with the passing years,&#xD;
shall wear their funeral drapery of clinging sea-weed, and shall&#xD;
listen to the ceaseless requiem  of their departed grandeur&#xD;
chanted through. deserted chambers by the lonely waters of the&#xD;
deep.&#xD;
This morning we look upon the " City of the Sea " in all its&#xD;
beauty. The sunlight catches up the spray of each tiny wave-&#xD;
let, that, in playful glee, lifts its head above the blue waters 'of&#xD;
the canal, and crowns it with a tiara of glittering diamonds.&#xD;
Gondolas, barges, and launches, decorated with gay pennons of&#xD;
red, white, and blue, pass each other in quick succession.&#xD;
Here and there, like a proud bird of the sea, a-huge cano-&#xD;
pied bissoni-" property of some noble lord" -looks down&#xD;
with haughty air upon the less pretending proportions of a&#xD;
paotti, which, like a' sea-shell guided by Neptune's messenger,&#xD;
waits at a flight .of marble steps the coming of its master.&#xD;
It is a festive day in Venice !  -&#xD;
The Grand Canal is a blaze of color. The oarsmen, in fanci-&#xD;
ful costumes, corresponding to the decorations of their gondo-&#xD;
las, challenge each other in the skilful management of their&#xD;
&#xD;
little vessels. Here, a, stately Greek, with scarlet jacket and&#xD;
short white tunic, guides a gondola with formidable beak,,.an=&#xD;
overarching canopy of scarlet and white, and its hangings bor-&#xD;
dered with heavy gilt fringe, while an attendant train of lesser&#xD;
boats completed the miniature Argonautic expedition. A little&#xD;
farther up the Canal, a Turkish oarsman, with an immense tur-&#xD;
ban of red and black, a red tunic, and Oriental trowsers, sits.&#xD;
at the helm of a floating Ottoman palace, while near him, in&#xD;
striking contrast, is moored a Spanish vessel, with colors of&#xD;
green, red, and white.&#xD;
The dark walls of the buildings, some of marble, others of&#xD;
stone, that overlook each side of the Canal, are brightened and&#xD;
adorned with hangings of every variety of color ; while the&#xD;
light colonnades and balconies are filled with eager, anxious&#xD;
watchers. Every arch or bridge, that commands a view, pre-&#xD;
sents the same picture. of the human face divine, with the same&#xD;
expression -r-that of curious expectation.&#xD;
The Ducal Palace, once the pride of Venice, once the mag-&#xD;
nificent home of the Doges, once the treasury of art, stands&#xD;
out in bold relief at the head of the quay ; its arabesque carv-&#xD;
ing, its beautifully proportioned pillars, glittering in the sun-&#xD;
light. From the entrance of the palace, is extended a roll of&#xD;
carpeting across the Piazetta, reaching to the marble steps that&#xD;
lead down into the water - a very path of roses, from which,&#xD;
in fancy, there comes a soft perfume, floating on the morning&#xD;
breeze.&#xD;
What' do these gay adornings, this ornamenting of barges&#xD;
and launches, this moving to and fro ; the gathering of the&#xD;
people in holiday attire, the expectant looks directed towards&#xD;
the entrance of the Grand Canal-what does it all proclaim'&#xD;
Has the shadow upon the dial receded ? has time gone back-&#xD;
ward, and brought us Ascension Day of the century past? And&#xD;
are we to behold the _solemn rites and ceremonies, of the wed-&#xD;
ding of the Adriatic to the Royal, Doge ?  Alas!' the beau-&#xD;
tiful sea bears a widowed heart ! The power has passed from&#xD;
the dynasty of Anafesto Paiilulio, and with .it has gone the&#xD;
poetic institution of Pope Alexander II. It is the sun 'of&#xD;
the nineteenth century that shines upon her, and Venice yields&#xD;
to another rule. From the tower of San Marco, where in an-&#xD;
cient days floated the triple gonfalon, that told of Republican&#xD;
conquest, now waves the flag of Austria, and to-day the re-&#xD;
cently appointed Viceroy makes his first official visit to Venice,.&#xD;
bringing with him his beautiful bride. This new Viceroy was&#xD;

&#xD;
not unknown-to the citizens of Venice. He had dwelt among&#xD;
them when only a midshipman in the Austrian navy ; and af-&#xD;
terwards they had seen him in their midst wearing the uniform&#xD;
of an Admiral. They had learned to love the noble young.&#xD;
Prince, and they knew he deserved the reputation he had won&#xD;
for justice, generosity, and chivalry. And so, when he was&#xD;
appointed Viceroy of the Italian provinces, they welcomed him&#xD;
with joy, for though Italy pined for independence, yet when&#xD;
not able to achieve it she desired a humane ruler ; and though, .&#xD;
as an Austrian politically, the Archduke Maximilian was their&#xD;
enemy, they knew he was personally their friend; and in&#xD;
spite of the sullen nobles who hung aloof, and with Count&#xD;
Cavour cried out against Austria and the Austrians, the&#xD;
people gave way to the joy that filled their hearts at the ap-&#xD;
pointment, and determined to give a grand reception to the&#xD;
man who, they felt, would not make them feel the weight of&#xD;
oppression.&#xD;
A united and prolonged shout from a thousand voices tells&#xD;
that the barge which bears the Viceroy is in sight. He comes&#xD;
from Milan, where he had been a few weeks before most enthu-&#xD;
siastically received with his young bride.&#xD;
Like a floating mass of gold, its sides gorgeous in gilded.s&#xD;
carving, a regal canopy overhanging a dais enclosed by a deli-)&#xD;
cate balustrade ; with no tawdry trappings, yet elegantly mag-.&#xD;
nificent, the gondola or barge bearing the royal party came in&#xD;
.sight of the Ducal Palace, and moved like a thing of life gen-&#xD;
tly up the Canal, the gayly dressed oarsmen keeping time ,with&#xD;
their long oars to the motion of the vessel. At the prow stood&#xD;
the Archduke Maximilian. Uncovering his head, he smilingly&#xD;
acknowledged the shouts of welcome with which they were&#xD;
greeted. Seated on the dais, surrounded by the members of&#xD;
the cortege, beneath the canopy that shaded, without obscuring&#xD;
those beneath, was the Archduchess Carlotta. As they neared&#xD;
the marble steps, Maximilian approached the dais, and taking&#xD;
her hand led her to the front of the canopy, where together&#xD;
they acknowledged the vivas of the people, which now went&#xD;
up with more enthusiasm than before. As he stood there,&#xD;
proudly, in the open sunlight, the stars and crosses of his rank&#xD;
and office glittering upon his breast, the eye of the Archduke took&#xD;
in with loving eagerness, the scene before him. This demon-&#xD;
stration of welcome was very grateful to his heart ; the usually&#xD;
silent palace of the.Doges rang with the echoes of the huzzas&#xD;
that rent the air. A true chivalric spirit is antagonistic to&#xD;
&#xD;
despotism or oppression; and though a country, a province, or&#xD;
a State, by the fortunes of war, may become tributary to one&#xD;
more powerful, yet a magnanimous government or ruler ever&#xD;
disdains to crush out of the heart of the weaker, the manly&#xD;
love of freedom and of liberty ; disdains to grind the iron heel&#xD;
of tyranny into their souls, until, under the degrading yoke, a&#xD;
free people are reduced to abject slavery. So felt Archduke&#xD;
Maximilian. He was now the representative of Austria in&#xD;
Italy, and it was not his desire to humiliate the people under his&#xD;
rule by a harsh and unyielding administration, but he rather&#xD;
hoped, by endearing himself to them, by the exercise of just&#xD;
and humane policies, to root out of their hearts, their hatred to&#xD;
Austria. Such was Maximilian's cherished dream in going to&#xD;
Italy, and gladly did he receive these acknowledgments of&#xD;
welcome as in part an assurance for the future.&#xD;
The gondola has reached the steps, at the head of which the&#xD;
dignitaries of the city await the landing of the party.&#xD;
And now they have ascended the steps, and are conducted,&#xD;
with their cortege, across the Plaza to the patriarchal cathedral&#xD;
of San Marco, where they are received by the ecclesiastical&#xD;
authorities with all due ceremony. Through the five domes&#xD;
which -crown the church, echo the strains of the organ, in&#xD;
solemn, Catholic worship, as the Archduke and Archduchess&#xD;
kneel before the altar to receive the holy blessing.&#xD;
As the cortege left the cathedral, crossed the Plaza, and&#xD;
again reached the palace, the loud-mouthed instruments of an&#xD;
Italian band rent the air with concord of sweet sounds. The&#xD;
Ducal Palace was to be the home of the Viceroy during his stay&#xD;
in Venice, his residence proper being at Milan; so the' royal&#xD;
party entered the palace, ascended the Giant's Staircase, with its&#xD;
statues of Mars and Neptune keeping guard over the treasures&#xD;
of wealth and art within, and entered the hall of reception.&#xD;
The populace without clamored for another sight of the Vice-&#xD;
roy ; and in answer to their repeated calls, Maximilian at last&#xD;
appeared upon the balcony, and in a short, but elegant address&#xD;
in Italian, gave the policy of the Austrian Government, and=&#xD;
her intentions, towards the Italian provinces. He assured the&#xD;
Italians, that "though they accepted with ungracious spirit the&#xD;
fortunes of war, and looked with suspicion upon Austria, they&#xD;
would find that tyranny had no part in her future regime. The&#xD;
Venetians, as far as possible, should be as virtually free as un-&#xD;
der a government of their own selection. It should he his'en-&#xD;
deavor to increase the commerce of Venice, and to restore&#xD;

her ancient maritime supremacy ; to foster genius, the love of&#xD;
letters, the cultivation of the arts, and the study of science,&#xD;
until, disentombed, her people should again point to her with&#xD;
pride and glory.&#xD;
The acclamations of joy, the repeated shouts, "Viva le Vice-&#xD;
roy ! viva Maximilan ! " told him that his words fell like dew&#xD;
upon the hearts of the Venetians, who knew that to this man they&#xD;
were for the present given in keeping ; and it was then, upon&#xD;
the day of his arrival in Venice, that bond of union was&#xD;
established between the Viceroy and the people that lasted&#xD;
throughout his stay in Italy ; for Maximilian entered upon his&#xD;
delicate task (for what position is attended with greater diffi-&#xD;
culties, than that of appointed ruler over a country once free?)&#xD;
with the highest purposes, the truest intentions, and the noblest&#xD;
appreciation of his duty, both to Venice and to Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
T    IX months had passed away, and again the Archduke&#xD;
and Archduchess have come from Milan to visit the&#xD;
people of Venice.&#xD;
It was the last night of the Carnival. Night, with' its&#xD;
dreamy spell of romance and poetry ! The bright moonbeams&#xD;
steal softly down into the quiet waters, bearing with them the&#xD;
deep shadows of the gondolas, that, with colored lights at the&#xD;
helm, of red, white, and blue, glide swiftly over the calm bosom&#xD;
of the Canal; while, everywhere, the lamps of the city challenge&#xD;
the brightness of the stars, in the blue sky above.&#xD;
The Piazzetta in front of the Ducal Palace was thronged&#xD;
with citizens, anxious for the signal for the grand display of&#xD;
fireworks, with which the festivities of the evening are to be&#xD;
ushered in. To-night, every one is out for enjoyment, for it is&#xD;
the farewell to gayety, and to-morrow comes the solemn, sacrifi-&#xD;
cial season of Lent.&#xD;
As the light rockets and Roman candles sped upward, and&#xD;
then, describing a parabolic curve, began to descend in waving&#xD;
brightness, until they fell, a shower of dust, into the water be-.&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JEWELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
neath the shouts of the multitude went up in a prolonged cry&#xD;
~of merriment and joy.&#xD;
But see! Rising from the position occupied by a group of&#xD;
Austrian soldiery, above the heads of the crowd, dazzling the&#xD;
eye by its brilliance, is seen a double crescent - the smaller&#xD;
just filling the concave of the larger -which in flaming letters&#xD;
ofuruby brightness formed the word "MAXIMILIAN     while&#xD;
just beneath, in diamond whiteness, is the name "CARLOTTA ! "&#xD;
Again and again went up the shout, "Viva le Viceroy!&#xD;
Viva la, Signora Carlotta!"&#xD;
The Italians had almost forgotten that the Archduke was an&#xD;
Austrian, so lightly had the German iule sat upon them under&#xD;
his administration during the past six months. He had been&#xD;
so true to his promises, so faithful to his purposes, that there&#xD;
were not wanting those, either in Milan or Venice, to bless him.&#xD;
This was his first visit to Venice, since his reception there, six&#xD;
months ago, when he remained only a few days; and so encour-&#xD;
aged by his nearness to them, and led on by their generous im-&#xD;
pulses, the crowd in front of the palace cried out the more,&#xD;
"Viva le Viceroy !"&#xD;
From the entrance of the Ducal Palace, there .emerged two&#xD;
figures, each clad in the dark covering of a domino; while&#xD;
heavy masques of satin entirely baffled curiosity by concealing&#xD;
the features of their faces. The height and stature of the one&#xD;
proclaimed his sex; while the other clung so timidly to his&#xD;
arm, that it left but little doubt of the trembling woman's&#xD;
heart, that beat beneath the sombre disguise. Mingling with&#xD;
the crowd collected on the piazzetta, they were soonlost in&#xD;
the waving sea of human beings moving restlessly to and fro,&#xD;
many of whom, like themselves, were disguised in domino and&#xD;
masque.&#xD;
As the .chef d'oeuvre of the evening went up, -the double&#xD;
crescent, -the two whom we have noticed, stood side by side&#xD;
watching it, until the last ray of its brightness vanished amid&#xD;
the shouts of the soldiery and the populace. A coarse voice&#xD;
near them gave' forth a half-audible hiss, which was lost in the&#xD;
vivas of the multitude.&#xD;
A terrific oath, unbroken Italian, from the same voice now&#xD;
fell upon the ear.&#xD;
"iD-n these cursed Venetians! they deserve liberty in-&#xD;
deed! Talk of freedom, and yield so to Austrian tyranny.&#xD;
1ah! it sickens even a German to hear how tey cry 'iva&#xD;
for Italy!l' and 'Viva fore Austria U 'Viva Victor Emman-&#xD;

uel !' and 'Viva Maximilian !' in the same breath !  But&#xD;
with all their shouting, it's d-d few favors they are likely to&#xD;
get from this young Ilapsburg scion; he is too nearly descended&#xD;
from the despotic, grasping Maria Theresa and her son&#xD;
Joseph ! "&#xD;
" And, I say," responded his neighbor, en masque, in pure&#xD;
Italian tones, "I say, who are you -German as you are- to&#xD;
give the Italians rules of conduct?  You are not likely to help'&#xD;
her gain liberty, that you talk about so loudly ! Attend to your&#xD;
own affairs in Prussia ! Go home and stay there ; Venice can&#xD;
take care of herself; you needn't trouble!" he added, with~ a&#xD;
sneer so perceptible, that a loud laugh issued from the bystand-&#xD;
ers a few of whomhad been diverted from the fireworks by the,&#xD;
conversation.&#xD;
The Prussian-for such he was -already heated by liquor,&#xD;
grew enraged at the ridicule directed against him.&#xD;
"Ah ! that's the way for young noblemen" (the young man's&#xD;
dress and bearing told that he was 'of high rank)." who want&#xD;
offices to talk ! Tell Austria how much Italy loves and blesses&#xD;
her ! Throw dust in her eyes, and perhaps the taxes wont be&#xD;
so heavy on your fine estates; that's the way to free Italy.&#xD;
Go on, go on; give festivals in honor of Austria!"&#xD;
As the insulting, jeering tones of the maladetti tedeschi, fell&#xD;
upon the young nobleman's ear, the hot blood rushed to his&#xD;
cheek, and upon the impulse of the moment his hand was&#xD;
raised, and fell in a stinging blow upon the face of his adver-&#xD;
sary,&#xD;
" Take that ! you Prussian dog and German traitor ! And&#xD;
for your pains learn to take care of your own affairs. Teach&#xD;
your Fredericks to keep the Burgher guards in subjection, and&#xD;
you will be well employed!"&#xD;
Smarting under the pain of the blow, which was inflicted&#xD;
with no light touch, and writhing in spirit under the taunts&#xD;
of his opponent, whose bravery had evidently turned the tide&#xD;
of opinion in his favor, the man, with a volley of oaths,&#xD;
quickly drew from his side a little dagger, and rushing upon&#xD;
the young man, who seemed unprepared for an attack, would&#xD;
have plunged it into his .breast ; when suddenly, it was&#xD;
wrenched from his grasp, and his hand was held in a firm, iron-&#xD;
like' clasp. Turning, it was only the figure of a black- domino&#xD;
that he saw, and before he could recover from his surprise, the&#xD;
cry of " Police ! police !" rang through the crowd.'&#xD;
The hand quickly left its hold upon the Prussian; and the&#xD;
&#xD;
wearer of the domino hurriedly whispered to the young noble-&#xD;
man, "-The Plaza San Marco," and was lost amid the others.&#xD;
" Duke Maximilian ? " whispered the nobleman, in surprise,&#xD;
as they made their way through the crowd, "and the Arch-&#xD;
duchess with you?" as he caught sight of the figure at his&#xD;
side.&#xD;
" Silentio I" returned the Archduke, for it was indeed he.&#xD;
"We are strictly incognito to-night, Stromboli. Let us sepa-&#xD;
rate ; we'll attract attention - or no - signal a gondola."&#xD;
" We'll not meet that turbulent fellow again," said the Count&#xD;
Stromboli, as they neared the marble steps, and stood there&#xD;
waiting the approach of a gondola. "I owe your Highness, in&#xD;
addition to the many other favors, a greater one than all to-&#xD;
night; for my life was not worth much, before that man's dag-&#xD;
ger. I foolishly came out unprepared for any difficulty,-as I&#xD;
know they are so unfrequent in Venice."&#xD;
"You might indeed have borne an ugly wound, if the Prus-&#xD;
sian's weapon had touched your scarf; but he is safely lodged&#xD;
now for the night, I think, in the hands of the guard. Prus-&#xD;
sia can never let Austria pass without a thrust. Our friend&#xD;
to-night, doubtless, hoped to stir up a regular row between the&#xD;
people and the soldiers over their little device. .But see ! here&#xD;
is our gondola ! This is indeed an escapade, for our little Prin-&#xD;
cess here, whose heart is beating audibly over our recent dra-&#xD;
matic episode. We can see the' beauties of the Carnival from&#xD;
the Canal first, and afterwards return to the Plaza."&#xD;
While speaking, they descended the little steps that led to&#xD;
the water,, where waited a gondola ornamented with colored&#xD;
lights, and bearing aloft at its helm, a large flag embroidered&#xD;
with fanciful device.&#xD;
Assisting the Archduchess into the little bark, the Arch-&#xD;
duke stepped lightly in, followed by Count Stromboli, a young&#xD;
nobleman who had, since the Archduke's viceroyship in Italy,&#xD;
made himself quite his friend.&#xD;
Slipping a coin into the hand of the gondolier, they were&#xD;
soon speeding over the Grand Canal. Lightly the long oars&#xD;
touched the moonlit waters, leaving a';soft gleam of radiance&#xD;
rippling the surface behind.  Onward they went, passing in&#xD;
quick succession,-gondolas, adorned like their own with colored&#xD;
transparencies, freighted with happiness, that spoke from&#xD;
the lovely faces, and echoed from the ringing laughter of those&#xD;
within.&#xD;
From the distance, came the sound of music. Mellowed and&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
softened, as, borne by the evening breeze over the water, it&#xD;
lingered on the quiet air. Nearer and nearer it came, until,&#xD;
passing under the arch, of the Grand Bridge, which itself shone&#xD;
with light, the beautiful gondola, " Star of the Evening," with&#xD;
its magnificent band of musicians, came in sight.&#xD;
Festooned about its sides, forming half-circles of varied light,&#xD;
were transparencies of red, white, and blue.. In the centre of&#xD;
the gondola, was an ornamented pavilion, under which the mu-&#xD;
sicians sat. A miniature chandelier, suspended within, threw a&#xD;
soft light upon the gilded musical instruments, which were all&#xD;
under perfect control of the master hands that guided them.&#xD;
With divine sweetness, began the introddzione to the exquisite&#xD;
air from Flotow's " Martha," "M 'appari tutt'arnor."  Ris-&#xD;
ing and falling in musical cadence, now softly modulated into a.&#xD;
strain of sadness, now swelling with a lover's pleading, the&#xD;
very air seemed to tremble with delight at the sound of such&#xD;
heavenly melody.&#xD;
As the gondola containing the party we have left, passed this&#xD;
floating temple of music, the ecstasy of the Archduchess knew&#xD;
no bounds. A passionate lover of the fine arts, an adept her-&#xD;
self in music and painting, these months in Italy were to her&#xD;
full of poetic and spiritual pleasure. Though in Milan she was&#xD;
happy, yet she hailed with delight the visits to Venice ; and&#xD;
she had persuaded the Archduke, a few days since, to come&#xD;
hither during the Carnival, in order that she might witness the&#xD;
gayeties of the season, in which to-night she hoped, by her dis-&#xD;
guise, to be an unknown, unrestrained participator.&#xD;
They had passed lofty palaces that in stately grandeur looked&#xD;
down upon their humbler neighbors'; had -seen the lights from&#xD;
within reflected in the water without, and dancing upon the&#xD;
little waves that smiled at the stars above ; they had gone the&#xD;
whole length of the grand street of Venice, and were again re-&#xD;
turning to the Plaza San Marco, the public square, which was&#xD;
now the scene of merriment and festivity. A crowd of mas-&#xD;
queraders had gathered there, and were enjoying the exhilara-&#xD;
tion of the merry dance.&#xD;
For some moments, the party sat in the gondola at the foot&#xD;
of the steps, watching the graceful movements of the dancers,&#xD;
who kept time to the tinkling of their castanets. It was indeed&#xD;
a strange, grotesque gathering, that was seen on the Plaza this&#xD;
night,; a confused variety of costumes, the personal identity&#xD;
of the wearer of each, concealed more or less by the black&#xD;
masque. Here a merry contadina tossed tlie tambourine up-&#xD;
&#xD;
ward, keeping time to the steps of her companion, whose bright&#xD;
Poblita dress shone conspicuous in the crowd ; there, a fierce-&#xD;
looking knight in armor, whispered a soft petition to some Span-&#xD;
ish maiden ; while now and then, casting a shadow over the&#xD;
gaudy costumes of those around, the dark, flowing robe of a&#xD;
domino, might be seen moving in and out.&#xD;
" What a free, unrestrained pleasure ! " said the Archduke&#xD;
at last. "-Heaven bless the inventor of masques ! I cannot&#xD;
stand to be merely a looker-on here, for I have 'caught the&#xD;
Terpsichorean spirit. If your Highness," continued he, turn-&#xD;
ing to the Archduchess, " will wait here with the good Count&#xD;
for but one moment, I'll take a turn in the dance with that&#xD;
meek-looking little peasant girl, you see by the pillar there ! "&#xD;
The Archduke leapt lightly from the gondola, leaving the&#xD;
Archduchess and the Count to watch his adventures from the'&#xD;
retirement of their position, which was to Carlotta infinitely&#xD;
more agreeable, than mingling with the promiscuous assembly on&#xD;
the Plaza. To-night, the Archduchess had entered into all the&#xD;
delightful freedom of an incognita, and her heart beat gladly,&#xD;
as she felt that for a brief space royalty was left behind, and&#xD;
she was as free as the peasant maiden upon her native hills.&#xD;
Doubtless many a queenly heart has chafed, as did poor Marie&#xD;
.Antoinette of France, under the gilded chains, and longed, as&#xD;
a prisoned bird for the pure air of heaven, for liberty of&#xD;
thought, speech, and action&#xD;
Even the proudest feel sometimes, the blessing of being lost&#xD;
in the great tide of humanity ; of being where the beating of&#xD;
the heart is known to itself alone and its impulsive strokes&#xD;
are not counted and measured by a stranger's ear, but only go&#xD;
in with others to sound forth the great knell of time ; the bless-&#xD;
ing of feeling that their actions are not of such moment, that&#xD;
they are weighed and judged by their results, while the pure,&#xD;
holy motives that prompt them go for naught.&#xD;
While the Archduchess and Count Stromboli watched the&#xD;
scene with interest, the Archduke. gave himself up to the feel-&#xD;
ing that "a little nonsense now and then, is relished by the&#xD;
wisest men," and entered with zest into the amusement.&#xD;
Approaching the little peasant girl whom he had selected,-he&#xD;
soon led her forward,and joined the dancers. In the pauses&#xD;
of the dance - as- he whispered some happy .compliment in&#xD;
her ear, and watched the nervous twitching of her, features,&#xD;
which the masque, half lace and half velvet, but poorly con-&#xD;
cealed, and marked her embarrassed modest movements - his-&#xD;

own heart, in all the buoyancy and freshness of young man-&#xD;
hood, danced at the impress which idle flattery and empty com-&#xD;
pliments made upon this unsophisticated child of nature ; for&#xD;
she was evidently 4 stranger in Venice, and was perhaps making&#xD;
her debut at the carnival to-night.&#xD;
" Do you live in Venice ?" questioned the Archduke, as they&#xD;
paused a moment.&#xD;
" No, no,"-said his companion, with a coquettish shake of&#xD;
the curls that clustered about her shoulders; " we live at&#xD;
Aboni, not far from Padua. I have long wanted to come to&#xD;
Venice during the Carnival, and luckily, business brought us&#xD;
here just now -my father and I, you know. But I am afraid&#xD;
I've lost him / The music and lights have dazed us both so,&#xD;
that we have become separated ; but I know he must be here&#xD;
on the Plaza somewhere, and will find me afterwhile."&#xD;
"And you don't feel afraid to be alone among so many&#xD;
strangers?" said the Archduke, admiring the innocence that&#xD;
gave such fearlessness.&#xD;
"Oh, no ! I shall see my father again soon. And as for&#xD;
these people, they are all thinking too much of themselves and&#xD;
their own happiness to trouble me ; and," she added, lowering&#xD;
her voice, " there are no Austrians or Germans on the Plaza,&#xD;
I see."&#xD;
" Then you hate Austria ? "&#xD;
" Hate Austria?  What. a question for one Italian to ask&#xD;
another ! But, sir, do you know anything about the Austrian&#xD;
Viceroy, who they say is now in Venice ? and do you know&#xD;
how we may manage to see him, for it is for that purpose we&#xD;
have come here. I had, perhaps, better tell you about it. I.&#xD;
have a brother, Pietro - a wild boy he is, too, but good-&#xD;
hearted, you know - who a few days since, at Padua where he&#xD;
has been going to school, got into great trouble with the Aus-&#xD;
trian guard. His only offence was that at the public exhibition,&#xD;
he recited-a little poem of his own composition, breathing love to&#xD;
Italy, and hatred to Austria. No one knew but he was, going&#xD;
to say a speech, like the others, until he came out with his&#xD;
poem; there was a great noise and talk about it, and at last&#xD;
the colonel of the Regiment at Padua, ordered his arrest, and&#xD;
he is now at their barracks under guard. They needn't be so&#xD;
frightened: Pietro is not Garibaldi indisguise ! Pietro was&#xD;
wrong; but it isn't worth keeping him in arrest for. My fa-&#xD;
tiher and I have come to see the Viceroy about it ; for they&#xD;
say he is kind and good, and we feel sure, he will give us a.&#xD;
&#xD;
discharge for Pietro, who I know will never write a rhyme&#xD;
again 'so long as he lives !"&#xD;
The Archduke had listened with interest to the girl's recital&#xD;
of her trouble, and when she had finished, said with an amused&#xD;
expression, -&#xD;
" Well, that's a bad scrape! And so you want to see the Vice-&#xD;
roy ? He is now Venice, and as I know him quite well, myself,&#xD;
I think I can manage to present you to him, with little difficulty.&#xD;
If you will be at the Ducal Palace, at the foot of the Giant's&#xD;
Staircase to-morrow at twelve, I will see that your petition is&#xD;
laid before the Viceroy."&#xD;
" Oh, thank you ! thank you ! " cried the girl. " But," she&#xD;
added after a moment's thought, "how shall I know you? for&#xD;
I have not seen your face, and I will not remember your voice&#xD;
well enough ?"&#xD;
. The Archduke, bending down, slightly raised his masque so&#xD;
that his partner caught a glimpse of his handsome face, and then&#xD;
placed it quickly back again.&#xD;
"Ah! I shall not forget you!" exclaimed his companion.&#xD;
"See! there is my father now, looking for me. We shall come,&#xD;
to-morrow!!"&#xD;
The Viceroy consigned the innocent girl to the paternal care,&#xD;
and warning her to be more cautious in future, and not get&#xD;
lost again, quickly crossed the Plaza, and joined the Arch-&#xD;
duchess and the Count, who were beginning to grow impatient&#xD;
at his stay.&#xD;
" A real Caliph adventure ! Haroun Al Raschid the Second !"&#xD;
exclaimed the Archduke; "you shall hear it all to-morrow, so no&#xD;
questions to-night. What is the play at La Fenice tonight ?&#xD;
Lucrezia, is it not ? Will madam here give her consent to end&#xD;
the evening there ?"&#xD;
"'No, no !" cried the Archduchess and the Count in unison.&#xD;
" Do you remember Orsini's late attempt at Paris ?" continued&#xD;
the latter; "and there are bad men everywhere, ready to do&#xD;
wicked deeds."&#xD;
"IBah !" exclaimed the Archduke, "how fearful and timid&#xD;
you have grown ! Would you seclude a man entirely from the&#xD;
world, before insuring his life ? "&#xD;
"Does your Highness -remember, though, the warning re-&#xD;
ceived the day of your arrival in Venice of the disaffection&#xD;
of the Counts Rochetti and Benvenuto ?" said Count Stromboli,&#xD;
" and their designs upon your life? "&#xD;

he Archduke's determination outweighed all objections ; so,&#xD;
pping to the Ducal Palace to doff the domino and masque,&#xD;
soon found themselves in their private, box at La Fenice;&#xD;
ere the play had well-nigh reached its tragic ending.&#xD;

oughout the city were hushed, the theatres were closed,&#xD;
all was quiet, save the occasional plash of the water, as&#xD;

* Caximilian's own words.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the bright-eyed, picturesque-looking maiden, we recognize&#xD;
the peasant girl of the evening before; and the old man with&#xD;
whom she is conversing is her father, who, clad in the humble&#xD;
dress of a countryman, is a proud representative of his honest,&#xD;
hard-working class.&#xD;
" Margherita, Margherita !_" said the old man in a half&#xD;
whisper, " I think we had better go ! Don't you see how the&#xD;
police watch us ? No use waiting here. We'll never see the&#xD;
Viceroy at this rate ! That oily-tongued Signor, was toying&#xD;
with you last night just to get a smile, or a kiss from such a&#xD;
foolish chit as he saw you was ! You ought to have let me&#xD;
come alone to Venice, Margherita ! for all these grand sights&#xD;
and the deceitful mummery of handsome. Signors, as you call&#xD;
them, have set you daft!"&#xD;
" Yes, yes!" exclaimed the girl, pettishly. "I don't doubt it&#xD;
would be best to shut me up forever,and build a wall as high&#xD;
as Babel around me, to keep me safe."&#xD;
"Ah well !-" said her father, "it may be for Pietro's good&#xD;
that we are here, but I think poor Giovanni will suffer !"&#xD;
"Pish !" said Margherita, " Giovanni is not such a jealous&#xD;
churl as ,to be angry if I look at another. He can trust me,&#xD;
and I should think you might, too ! The stranger was kind,"&#xD;
she continued, pouting out a pair of ruby lips that were as&#xD;
tempting as two ripe cherries.&#xD;
" See there ! see there ! " she exclaimed, as she looked up the&#xD;
staircase. ' He is here before us, and doubtless we have kept&#xD;
him waiting with  our idle chaffering," added Margherita,&#xD;
with chagrin at the thought, as they began to go up the long&#xD;
flight of steps.&#xD;
"Well hemight wait," muttered the old man in-a surly tone,&#xD;
not over-pleased at his daughter's anxiety, -" well he might&#xD;
wait, for they make us wait long enough, these grandees ; and&#xD;
no thanks we get, either, for our patience."&#xD;
" So,.you are here ! " exclaimed Margherita's friend, as the&#xD;
two reached the head of the staircase, and he showed them into&#xD;
an ante-chamber near. " You wish to see the Viceroy? wait&#xD;
here one moment, and you shall be conducted to him; " say-&#xD;
ing which, he quickly left the room.&#xD;
Margherita and her father looked around them with amaze-&#xD;
ment. There were the beautifully frescoed walls, the work of .&#xD;
Tintorello ; here and there a mirror filled a space ; while soft&#xD;
divans, and inviting chairs, introduced for modern comfort,&#xD;
stood around.&#xD;

Margherita and her father remained standing, not daring&#xD;
to seat themselves amid so much that was new, and grand,&#xD;
and strange.&#xD;
" Father," whispered the girl, " Aladdin's palace must have&#xD;
been something like this; don't you think so ? "&#xD;
"Ah yes ! this is what becomes of honest Italians' money ! "&#xD;
complained the old man, who observed everything from a mat-&#xD;
te -of-fact, utilitarian point of view;- "these are mighty fine&#xD;
hings, and it's this trash that makes the grinding taxes."&#xD;
"Taxes ! taxes ! " cried the girl; " the same old tune ! You&#xD;
are in such a bad humor ; it's not likely you'll get much out of&#xD;
Viceroy, if you keep on at this rate ! These things are&#xD;
pretty ! I don't care whose money bought them !" And&#xD;
Margherita continued to admire, while the old man nursed his&#xD;
bad humor. He did not, indeed, like the great fascination the&#xD;
city seemed to have for Margherita; to it she had never been.&#xD;
before, and it had only been to get rid of her persuasion that&#xD;
h had, brought her now ; and he had already begun to regret&#xD;
that he had yielded -to her, for she would never be contented&#xD;
Jag in, he knew, in her simple country home. And then Poor&#xD;
Giovianni! her betrothed ! The old man sighed to the refrain,&#xD;
that, -&#xD;
"Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare."&#xD;
While they stood in silence, each busy with their own&#xD;
thoughts, inwarldy commenting upon the novelty of their posi-&#xD;
tion, the immense doors at the side of the room glided, as if by,&#xD;
magic, into the walls, and a stranger, stepping forward, begged&#xD;
them to follow him. A flush overspread the girl's face, as she&#xD;
missed the re-assuring voice of her friend, and she began to re.&#xD;
gret her temerity, - began to wish-that she had let her father&#xD;
come alone to see the Austrian Viceroy.&#xD;
The stranger conducted them into the adjoining apartment,&#xD;
wl'ere, in a state chair handsomely ornamented and slightly&#xD;
el vated, sat a young, handsome man in uniform. By his side&#xD;
was a beautiful lady, over whom twenty summers had scarcely&#xD;
passed, and whose winning smile, and gentle bearing re-assured&#xD;
thi beholder, by telling of the kindly heart beating within.&#xD;
In the room, were three or four officers wearing the Aus-&#xD;
trian uniform, and one or two gentlemen in the Italian citizens'&#xD;
dr ss, among whom we recognize the Count Stromboli.&#xD;
" The Viceroy, -His Highness, the Archduke Maximilian,&#xD;
&#xD;
whom you wish to see !" exclaimed the man who ushered them&#xD;
in.&#xD;
The girl looked up and beheld her partner of the evening&#xD;
before - the same handsome, genial face, and glad, noble eyes,&#xD;
that she had seen on the Plaza San Marco. The look of tim-&#xD;
idity gave place to a smile, as she, called out with some em-&#xD;
barrassment, -&#xD;
" Padre ! it is the Signor himself ! Sire ! " she cried, as she&#xD;
turned to the Archduke, "and are you really the Viceroy ? "&#xD;
"Yes, I am really the -Viceroy, my good girl, and I have&#xD;
kept my promise that you should see him," he added, smiling.&#xD;
"Now let ine present your father, there, who has not yet spo-&#xD;
ken to me, to the Archduchess Carlotta. This is my bonnie&#xD;
partner in last night's dance, your Highness."&#xD;
With a cordial, cheerful manner, and a word of wcacome, the&#xD;
Archduchess received the greeting of the old, man, and his&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
" Sire," said the old man, who at last found voice to speak,&#xD;
and felt that his first attempt must be' an apology for Margh-&#xD;
erita, " my daughter here is a wayward girl, and has never&#xD;
been to the city before. I trust you will pardon her boldness.&#xD;
Hereafter, she will .remain at home, until ghe gains more dis-&#xD;
cretion."&#xD;
" Ah!t my good friend," said the Archduke, as he noted the&#xD;
tears which stood in Margherita's eyes at this public reproof,&#xD;
"1\ argherita is a good girl, and is guilty of no offence. And&#xD;
th Archduchess and I will plead for her to come to Venice&#xD;
again, at the next Carnival."&#xD;
The smiles drove the tears away, as Margherita heard - the&#xD;
Archduke's words, and she saw her father's stern face begin to&#xD;
wear a softer look.&#xD;
Leaving the Archduchess to interest the girl, Maximilian&#xD;
turned his attention to the old peasant, and quietly engaged&#xD;
him in conversation, concerning himself and his own affairs.&#xD;
He drew[ from him the facts regarding his son Pietro's trouble,&#xD;
and seeing that it was only a boyish indiscretion, and the of-&#xD;
fender a'wild lad of fifteen, the Viceroy, anticipating the old&#xD;
man's petition, gave him an official order for the release of his&#xD;
son.&#xD;
A half hour quickly passed; the old man, already half-way&#xD;
disarmed of his prejudice against the Viceroy, was soon wonto&#xD;
him by the interest he manifested, in the science of husbandry,&#xD;
the grape-culture, wine-making, etc.-&#xD;

In the meantime, the Archduchess Carlotta obtained from&#xD;
argherita a sketch of her former life, her love for Giovanni,&#xD;
ho proved to be the son of a grape-grower near them, and her&#xD;
tlans for the future, the details of which the girl was happy to&#xD;
relate, to so interested a listener.&#xD;
When her father called to her that they must leave, the girl&#xD;
tarted as if from a dream. As she made a low obeisance to the&#xD;
rchduchess in parting, Carlotta took from h r own neck a&#xD;
lender gold chain, and laying it about Margherita's shoulders,&#xD;
aid to her softly, -.&#xD;
"Wear it for -my sake, and don't forget the Viceroy."&#xD;
"That she will not, nor will I," exclaimed the old peasant in&#xD;
is blunt fashion. " Though I had heard much of the Viceroy's&#xD;
oodness to my'spoor countrymen, yet, to be plain, I could not&#xD;
elieve it. I could not believe, that any good could come from&#xD;
ustria. I see I was wrong, and in the future, whatever may&#xD;
e my feelings towards the Germans, I shall always say.&#xD;
ustria has at least one noble son, and he, the Archduke Max-&#xD;
milian.'                           S&#xD;
" And remember, sire," said Margherita, "the Archduchess&#xD;
nd yourself, that go where you may, you bear with you the&#xD;
rayers and blessings of two hearts -my father's and my&#xD;
own."&#xD;
" And Pietro's too," said her father, who'could not let poor&#xD;
Margherita's speech pass without correction. "Pietro's too."&#xD;
"You forget Giovanni," said the Archduchess, smiling, as&#xD;
he girl, who blushed at her words, followed her father out of&#xD;
he room.&#xD;

Though the people of - Italy respected the Austrian Viceroy&#xD;
as a man, and loved and honored him- for the high, lofty, and&#xD;
upright principles that urged him to deeds of generous and lav-&#xD;
ish benevolence, yet the old-established prejudice to Austria,&#xD;
the old cry, " We want Italy for the Italians, and not for the&#xD;
Germans," was still in their hearts. Though it might be for-&#xD;
gotten for the moment., as in the instance narrated, it was still&#xD;
there ; 'the desire for liberty entwined about their very heart-&#xD;
strings, fibre, and sinew of their being.&#xD;
The labors of that crafty, shrewd statesman, Count Cavour,&#xD;
of the great warrior, Joseph Garibaldi, and the valorous hero',&#xD;
Victor Emmanuel, who was esteemed the rightful King of Italy,&#xD;
were beginning to show promise of a harvest-beginning to&#xD;
discover signs, that the day-dream of patriots, would in the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
future, perhaps not distant, shape itself into a palpable reality.&#xD;
The despair that had followed the peace of Villa Franca; had&#xD;
produced one good result - had taught the people one good les-&#xD;
son; had shown them that only in unity=- unity of purpose&#xD;
and action, the hope of freedom -freedom fronfthe "Adriatic&#xD;
to the Alps "- could be realized. All the minor duchies must&#xD;
be consolidated, and united under one ruler ; a man, in whom all&#xD;
had faith and confidence, before the Italians would be strong&#xD;
enough to become an independent people, and sustain a govern-&#xD;
ment, a literature, a religion, a language all their own.&#xD;
It was not Austria alone, that stood in the way of this; but&#xD;
at Rome, the Pope himself, with the Papal jurisdiction, was an&#xD;
obstacle almost insurmountable, and one that was not easily&#xD;
to be gotten rid of.&#xD;
During his short 'administration, scarcely two years, as&#xD;
Viceroy, the Archduke Maximilian, with keen discernment,&#xD;
and acute observation, saw the danger ahead, and the trouble&#xD;
brewing for Austria.   He knew the true beating of the&#xD;
Italian 'heart, and was not misled, or blinded by their im-&#xD;
pulsive vivas. He knew that the clouds were gathering that&#xD;
heralded a revolutionary storm; and knew, too, that the men&#xD;
who were urging, and pressing the people to action were not&#xD;
mad demagogues, or fanatical partisans ; but grave, shrewd,&#xD;
sober-thinking statesmen, who, through years of study, in exile,&#xD;
watching and learning the strong policies of other nations, had&#xD;
perfected their plans, and were determined, at least, to risk the&#xD;
attempt of giving to Italy, a free constitution, and a ruler from&#xD;
her own people, In vain did the Archduke urge these facts&#xD;
upon the Cabinet at Vienna; in vain did he .tell them of the&#xD;
powerful agencies at work in Sardinia; and in vain he foretold&#xD;
that Austria's. loss would be Sardinia's gain. Austria would&#xD;
not and perhaps could not, understand the true status. Italy&#xD;
seemingly was quiet, and it was hard to believe,' that, beneath&#xD;
the surface, a volcano was seething and boiling, with revolution-&#xD;
ary elements hurrying it into eruption.&#xD;
Still there was a clinging to the old Metternich theory of&#xD;
"keeping Italy ignorant, and therefore governable" Austria did&#xD;
not remember that the words " Liberty and Revolution" were&#xD;
the " Open Sesame ! "- the pass-word that made the Italians&#xD;
one.&#xD;
Poets4 kindled in secret the patriotic fire, and nursed the.&#xD;
longing for national freedom, by enthusiastic strains of the&#xD;

artial muse ; and the cry, "Italy is not dead ! " wakened the&#xD;
c hoes in the hearts of her sleeping sons.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Noo, no1 'tis not the silence of the grave.&#xD;
Hark I o'er our shore the waves of hope are breaking ;&#xD;
We yet have hearts to beat, and hands to save,&#xD;
They only need the signal for awaking.&#xD;
Italy dead?. the memory of the past&#xD;
Still bids us hopes of brighter days to cherish.&#xD;
Strike, then, my lyre ! thy loudest note, thy last,&#xD;
And bid her sons throw off the yoke, or perish."&#xD;
&#xD;
Such appeals, outbursts from the despairing hearts of her&#xD;
poetic sons, yet still breathing a shadow of hope, were not&#xD;
ade in vain; but whispered from hill to hill, echoed in the&#xD;
g een valleys, taught by the gray-haired sire to the lisping babe,&#xD;
were messengers at work, speeding the moment when the&#xD;
c11 should be obeyed. Italy was determined to be free, and it&#xD;
must be some master stroke of policy, that would have power to&#xD;
avert it.&#xD;
In the meantime, the Archduke Maximilian as Viceroy&#xD;
did as .seemed best. Knowing that a system of oppression&#xD;
and restraint of personal liberty -which was urged by some in&#xD;
Austria as the proper course -would but hasten the outburst,&#xD;
and bring the course of events to. an immediate crisis, he con'&#xD;
tinued the just and humane policy that characterized his entire&#xD;
a d   stration, hoping to delay, and if possible entirely avert,&#xD;
the revolution that seemed inevitable.&#xD;
There were at Vienna, however, carping statesmen, who, dis-&#xD;
approving and finding groundsfor censure in the conduct of all,&#xD;
save themselves, did not lack for complaint against the Viceroy&#xD;
o Lombardy. and Venice, but exerted. their influence, for the&#xD;
removal of a man who, they urged, by giving too much license&#xD;
t the Italians, was encouraging them in revolution, or- in. the&#xD;
tove of liberty, which tended to the same end.'&#xD;
So the Archduke was recalled; and scarcely had he left Italy&#xD;
before his prophecies were fulfilled. The storm of '59 came ;&#xD;
a d, when it was too late to be of advantage, Austria saw her&#xD;
e ror of judgment. Italy, with her strong ally, Napoleon --&#xD;
a name that like a shadow of evil haunts the House of Hapsburg,&#xD;
on the bloody plains of Magenta and Solferino gave the proud&#xD;
echo to the cry, "We will have Italy for the Italians, and not for&#xD;
the Germans!"&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
&#xD;
N a high rocky promontory, jutting out over the waters&#xD;
of the Adriatic, that rest in quiet at its base, or lash&#xD;
and .surge in storm-ridden fury, a few leagues - re-&#xD;
moved from the seaport of Trieste, stood the castle of&#xD;
Miramar, the home'to which, returning from Italy, the Arch-&#xD;
duke conducted the Archduchess Carlotta.&#xD;
The choice of the situation, the bold, determined position of&#xD;
the castle, which, while exposed to all the fury of wind- and&#xD;
wave, seemed to bid them defiance in its proud security, spoke&#xD;
the character of the man, its master. It was the delight of the&#xD;
Archduke to triumph over, and put down-difficulties.   In&#xD;
spite of the bald, bleak region over. whose heights the un-&#xD;
friendly sea-winds were ever sweeping with chilly breath, by&#xD;
assiduous care and attention, the surrounding slopes had&#xD;
been tastefully wooded, and the rising and falling ground&#xD;
was beautifully laid out, and'adorned with lovely flowers, while&#xD;
each hillside near, in the least protected from the cold, luxu-&#xD;
riated in flourishing fruit-trees, the culture oJ which was the&#xD;
Archduke's especial care.&#xD;
Notwithstanding all his philosophy, the withdrawal from the&#xD;
Viceroyship of Italy, under such unfavorable circumstances,&#xD;
was a mortifying blow to the pride of Maximilian; and though&#xD;
he kept the misanthropical feelings of his heart locked from the&#xD;
world, they were not the less bitter. Pei-haps no world-weary&#xD;
traveller, harsh and cynical from the injustice of his fellow-men,&#xD;
ever sought with more eagerness, the shades of his 'boyhood's&#xD;
home, than did Maximilian turn to Miramar, where all was&#xD;
peace and quiet. He had never resigned his position at the&#xD;
head of the Austrian navy, but still held his admiralship, the&#xD;
duties of which he resumed upon his return to Trieste. As&#xD;
there was no active duty on the sea, he was enabled to em-&#xD;

ploy a large portion of his time in adorning and beautifying&#xD;
his home, which it was his ambition to make an earthly para-&#xD;
dise. There, he could be free; there, he could gather about him&#xD;
the friends that appreciated him for his high, true qualities, and&#xD;
his goodness of soul. It was at this period of his life, that the&#xD;
friendship between the young Lieutenant Tegethoff, of the&#xD;
Austrian navy, and the Archduke began ; and to this gallant&#xD;
officer, whose talent Maximilian respected and appreciated,&#xD;
Austria has -since owed a debt of gratitude for the staunch ser-&#xD;
vice rendered in the Danish war, and his devotion and success&#xD;
have won for him an Admiral's command. Count Isolani also&#xD;
had returned from his long cruise, and was a welcome.guest at&#xD;
Miramar, for both the Archduke and the Archduchess, who had&#xD;
forgiven, and laughed at his little er&amp;amp;se d'amour, regarded him&#xD;
with high favor.S&#xD;
While the Archduke gathered his own friends around him,&#xD;
the pleasure of the Archduchess was not forgotten. Of the&#xD;
ladies in waiting, the accomplished Countess Kollonitz and the&#xD;
Countess Zichy were her constant companions, and the Arch-&#xD;
duke scarce knew a dearer friend. than the Count Frangois&#xD;
Zichy, who was likewise a member of the household, at Mira-&#xD;
mar.&#xD;
Though the castle was the resort of the learned, the intellec-&#xD;
tual, and the agreeable, from all parts of Germany, to whom its&#xD;
hospitalities were dispensed with lavish hands, the Archduke&#xD;
did not forget the studies which had been pursued from his&#xD;
youth with so much ardor. With a mind enriched by travel,&#xD;
and observation of men and manners; a soul that had drunk&#xD;
deep at the fountains of ancient lore; gifted with a retentive&#xD;
memory, a poetic fancy, and a painter's eye, Maximilian became&#xD;
now a man of letters, and penned the beautiful thoughts that&#xD;
in the future will be given to posterity, and, giving as they do, a&#xD;
true insight into his character, will embalm his name in all&#xD;
true hearts.'&#xD;
His surroundings, uniting, as they did, the wild and pictur-&#xD;
esque in nature, with the beautiful in art, fostered the. poetic&#xD;
genius in his soul.. The castle itself was elegantly fitted up&#xD;
with beautiful parlors, boudoirs, and picture galleries filled&#xD;
with choice paintings selected by .the Archduke and Arch-&#xD;
duchess in Italy ; while' without, in the extensive grounds,&#xD;
nestled in sheltered nooks, embowered in shrubbery, or climb-&#xD;
ing vines, were- charming little summer-houses, where often&#xD;
the Archduchess, wearying over her easel and brush, in&#xD;
&#xD;
the little studio within, would spend the long morning hours,&#xD;
surrounded by her ladies, enjoying the delightful breeze. that&#xD;
came inward from the sea; and oftentimes, one of the party, in&#xD;
the pauses of conversation, read aloud for the entertainment of&#xD;
the others, who toyed listlessly with their delicate broidery, or&#xD;
fancy work.&#xD;
Two or three marble steps led from the gravelled walk down&#xD;
to the water's edge, and at the foot' of these was moored a&#xD;
beautifully decorated skiff, always at the command of the in-&#xD;
mates of the castle ; and scarcely an afternoon passed, when&#xD;
there might not have been seen a merry party in the little boat,&#xD;
gliding over the waters of the gulf, the gentlemen, who were&#xD;
almost always naval officers, turning the helm that directed&#xD;
their course. It was indeed a home, a life for happiness and&#xD;
love !&#xD;
"How was it, your Highness," said the Countess Zichy,&#xD;
one afternoon, as they were returning, drifting, from an excur-&#xD;
sion on the water, -1"how was it, for you have never told us,&#xD;
that you came to select this site for Miramar? "&#xD;
Ah ! Isolani there remembers ! " cried the Archduke to the&#xD;
Count. " And you, Tegethoff, too, were with us, were you&#xD;
not?  Well, Countess, you shall hear the story. It was  yo&#xD;

indifferent success, when our pleasure was cut short by the ris-&#xD;

over the water. a regular Bora, endangering seriously our&#xD;
safety, by threatening destruction to our sails. We put into-&#xD;
first- one little arm of the sea, and then another, in -hope of&#xD;
finding a shelter, sufficient to protect us from the terrible wind&#xD;
which was lashing the sea into madness. Almost in despair, at&#xD;
being again and again disappointed, we, had nearly abandoned&#xD;
hope, and given ourselves up. to our fate, when, suddenly turn-&#xD;

protected by a natural wall of rock, and within which, -the sea&#xD;
lay still and waveless. Seeing that we should have to -spend&#xD;
some hours there, we managed to. land, and after securing our&#xD;

dering from one elevation to another, hardly knowing whither&#xD;
we went we at last found ourselves on the top of the promon-&#xD;

view of the sea, which the Castle of Miramar now commands;&#xD;
beautiful, or rather with a touch of the sublime, it had then,&#xD;
roaming and boiling like a seething caldron, until, lost in the&#xD;
distance, the waves mingled and merged themselves into a&#xD;
seeming calm. And there, too, midway between sky and earth,&#xD;
hung the cloud-capped Alps, the thick mist rolling up their&#xD;
wooded sides the towering summits lost in golden vapor. I&#xD;
was just at. the age when young manhood begins to prospect&#xD;
or the future," continued the Archduke with a smile. "I had&#xD;
een a Princess -"&#xD;
"It's a long story, Countess,- and you are growing tired, are&#xD;
you not ? " interrupted the Archduchess, slyly.&#xD;
" No, no ! " cried they all in unison, as they caught' the&#xD;
Archduchess' words, and noted her face, slightly tinged with&#xD;
rimson at the drift the Archduke had given to his story.&#xD;
'No, no: continue, your Highness ! "&#xD;
"I had seen a Princess," said the Archduke, merrily again,&#xD;
'that held, by some unearthly art, a magic spell over my heart ;&#xD;
nd her spirit haunting my thoughts taught me to long for a&#xD;
ome, -and, shall I say it ? its chiefest ornament; which Tupper&#xD;
ells us, - and I believe in Tupper, very strongly,  'is a good&#xD;

as so enraptured- that I inwardly determined there to set up&#xD;

nd declared it so cold, bleak, and unprotected that.it could&#xD;
ever be improved. But I thought differently; and, charmed&#xD;
ith the wild, picturesque beauty of the situation, adhered. to&#xD;
y selection. Under my own supervision the castle was built.&#xD;
Its style of architecture, I think, is well suited to the position.&#xD;
any natural difficulties have already succumbed, and in a few&#xD;
ears, Miramar can be made, I think, as lovely a palace home,&#xD;
ithin and without, as Germany can boast."&#xD;
" Yes, indeed," cried the Countess; "Miramar can even .ow&#xD;
ear the palm!"  And her words were echoed by all, as they&#xD;
came in sight of the rising turrets, glittering.with the gleams&#xD;
of fading glory. "Nothing dull; no.sameness, to weary the&#xD;
eye."&#xD;
A beautiful sunset view it was, that called forth from the&#xD;
arty in the boat, anew, the sentiment of admiration. First,&#xD;
&#xD;
the Castle of Miramar itself, like the Temple of Fame upon&#xD;
its rock of ice, loomed up in grand repose against the solemn&#xD;
sky; its stony walls lighted by the golden rays of the depart-&#xD;
ing sun, that, climbing the summit of the, distant Alps, lin-&#xD;
gered there, to send\ a quiver of arrows over the perforated&#xD;
cornice, and the carved architrave of the pillars supporting the&#xD;
balcony, and to strike with glinting splendor the glassy faces&#xD;
that, from the arched windows, looked-out upon the quiet sea.&#xD;
Above turret and tower, but still beneath the sunlight, waved&#xD;
the flag of Austria, in playful dalliance, coquetting with the&#xD;
evening breeze. Coming down to the edge of the stone parapet,&#xD;
that walls out and keeps back the encroaching wave, was the&#xD;
sloping garden, with its parterres- of lovely flowers, forever&#xD;
dew-impearled by the silvery spray of the marble fountain in&#xD;
the centre.  Back from the roses, in mock retirement, the&#xD;
stately oleander, the Oriental inaguey, the wonderful cactusfrom&#xD;
the Dalmatian plains, lifted their heads in proud dignity;&#xD;
then, in full view for some distance, now:lost in the .descent,&#xD;
now rising with the height, was the graveled road, winding its&#xD;
serpentine course to the entrance of the castle. In front of&#xD;
all, the sea was at rest, and stretched out, an unbroken sheen, into&#xD;
the misty distance; the wavelets, worn  out with the merry&#xD;
dance of the day, were lulling themselves into quietude, to the&#xD;
soft chimings of the rose-tinted shell. Now and then a white-&#xD;
winged bird flitted across the water, skimming its quiet surface&#xD;
in its swift passage, then mounting upward to the chang-&#xD;
ing sky -- that begins to lose its golden hue in twilight' purple,&#xD;
winnowing on the air, showers the crystal drops from its&#xD;
plumed wg, and then away ---away -over the hill-tops to its&#xD;
home,no mortal knoweth whither.&#xD;
For some moments, the little skiff floated over the. still wa-&#xD;
ter, no member of the party breaking the silence, each drink-&#xD;
ing in with rapture the beauty of the scene before theg. At&#xD;
last, they reach the marble steps that lead up into the garden,&#xD;
and the evening zephyr comes down 'to meet them, her breath&#xD;
sweet with the mingled fragrance of roses and jessamines,&#xD;
The skiff was fastened to- its moorings; and as theparty&#xD;
reachd the summer-house, half way up the garden,theqqiet&#xD;
moon rose up out of the water behind, and sent its silvery&#xD;
teams over land and sea. Lightly, the creeping vinesthat&#xD;
overhung the trellis work of nature's little temple, where they&#xD;
rested, .swa.ed to and fro in the breeze that stealthily crept&#xD;
erhe footsteps of happiness; and the s eetuvoiceof the&#xD;

."Ah!" said Countess Kollonitz, "we should make our vo-'&#xD;
ive offerings here to Nature; for she' has been very gracious&#xD;
and lavish in the display of her varied charms this evening."&#xD;
"Ali, Countess !" said the Archdchess, "you, who are * so&#xD;
o d of moonlight and romance, should have been with us in&#xD;
.taly, in Venice, in our night excursions on the Grand Canal.&#xD;

oonlight again; passing now a darksome pile, inanimate, still,&#xD;
and deserted, and again looking through the open windows into&#xD;
ome brilliantly lighted palace, the home of nobility, its illumi-&#xD;

"It cannot be more beautiful than this Paradise !" exclaimed&#xD;

"Moonlight, music, love, and flowers," said the Archduke, as&#xD;
e, with the gentlemen, came up from the parapet, where they&#xD;
ad lingered a moment behind the ladies. " Count Zichy, Teg-&#xD;

"And what shall it be?" said the Count. "A Sappho strain&#xD;
rom a mountain maiden's heart, or something from our Niebe-&#xD;

S"No, no ! not that fearful tiresome thing, filled up with ter-&#xD;

Countess Zichy.&#xD;
" Why, Countess, it is our great heroic poem, our epic,.our&#xD;

" A very German Iliad !" cried the Countess, "and 'Heaven&#xD;

"Ah! well, Countess," interrupted the Archduchess, " we&#xD;
must beg that you and Count Isolani postpone your recondite&#xD;
discussion until we have been gratified by getting our song.&#xD;
We all grow impatient ! Count Isolani, we are waiting; give&#xD;
us the mountain maiden's ditty."&#xD;
Count Isolani began, in a rich clear voice, that charming&#xD;
Tyrolese melody:&#xD;
"Son benia pastorella,&#xD;
Che acenzde ogni mattino ;&#xD;
Eo,*re*un ceteitno&#xD;
Di freeche frutto e flor;&#xD;
Olh viene al prirno al-bore,&#xD;
Epoma ruggia dose,&#xD;

A-/tn I A-htnI&#xD;
"I am a mountain maiden;&#xD;
From shady woodland bowers&#xD;
Fresh fruit and fragrant flowers&#xD;
I gather every morn.&#xD;
Come, as the dawn is breaking,&#xD;
Around my garden straying,&#xD;
When summer winds are playing,&#xD;
To cull bright roses there.&#xD;
A-hu ! A-hu I&#xD;
A-hu I!&#xD;
The Count gave the true mountain . echo to the refrain,&#xD;
"Ahu! A-hu !" which brought forth, not only a eulogy&#xD;
upon the song, but on the glorious country of the- Tyrol; the&#xD;
noble character of its people, who, with the fear of God, unite&#xD;
attachment to their Imperial Sovereign, the Emperor of Aus-&#xD;
tria, and an undying love of country.&#xD;
" Count Isolani, how long since you left Innsbriick ? It&#xD;
was. your birthplace, was it not ? " asked the Countess Zichy,&#xD;
while the others continued their conversation.&#xD;
" Yes ; I was born in the old castle near the city, a perfect&#xD;
mountain eyrie, that had been the home of my ancestors for&#xD;
years. I left, to go to Vienna when not more than fourteen&#xD;
years of age, and have been a wanderer ever since. My father&#xD;
died soon after I went away, and rests in the vault of the old&#xD;
chapel beside my ihother and sister, and I am theonly one left&#xD;
of the name. My heart beats back with an earnest love, to&#xD;
the home of my early boyhood; for the time was, when I knew&#xD;
the murmuring echo of each stream that dashed through the&#xD;
hollow gorges, as the voice of a; friend, and clomb. the moun-&#xD;
tain's rugged sides with the sure footing of a chamois hunter, and,&#xD;
with manly pride swelling my young heart, brought back my,&#xD;

t ophies to the castle. But now, all is changed ; the castle&#xD;
i falling. to decay ; only the old servants remain, and they,&#xD;
stem mournful relics of a past that it fills my heart with sad-&#xD;
ness to think of. I have been there once or twice, since my&#xD;
father's death. Once, his Highness, the archduke, did me the&#xD;
lonor to accompany me. The Tyrol and near Innsbrick, you&#xD;
know, was a famous hunting ground for the Emperor Maxi-&#xD;
milian of old; and the whole country is filled with memories of&#xD;
his daring deeds, and his wonderful escapes from death."&#xD;
" Yes," said the Archduke, who caught the Count's last&#xD;
words. "At Martinswand, which towers, an abrupt precipice,&#xD;
over the Inn, but a f w miles from Innsbruck, the great Maxi-&#xD;
mian came indeed near- losing his life. Led away in pursuit&#xD;
o a chamois among the rocks above, he, missed his footing,&#xD;
fell to the verge of the precipice, which towered eighteen hun-&#xD;
deed feet above the water below, and only saved himself by&#xD;
cIinging to a ledge of rock, with his head downwards. In&#xD;
this perilous position it seemed impossible to those below to&#xD;
tender him assistance. He was- at last, rescued, by a bold&#xD;
huntsman, Zips, of the little village Zirl, under the foot of the&#xD;
mountain, whose intrepidity the Emperor rewarded by bestow-&#xD;
ing upon him a pension for life, with the title of Count ' Hol-&#xD;
1 uer Von Hohenfelsen. The loyal people of Zirl have 1hol-&#xD;
1 wed a cave in the rock where this event occurred, and have&#xD;
paced, in it a crucifix, which, though it is eighteen feet high,&#xD;
is so far above the post road below, as scarcely to. be visible.&#xD;
I olani and I visited the place together, shortly after our re-&#xD;
t rn from our first travels."&#xD;
"And do you think, Count Isolani," said the Countess Kol-&#xD;
1 itz, "that you will never go back to the Tyrol to live ? "&#xD;
"Though I carry in my heart the love of the green hills and&#xD;
rt~gged mountain heights," said Count Isolani, "I fear this sea-&#xD;
man's life has taught me to rove -to love adventure. But ; "he&#xD;
continued, turning to the Archduke, "if, following the desti-&#xD;
nes of his Highness here, on land or sea, acting always in the&#xD;
h   ble capacity of Sancho Panza, I should be so fortunate as&#xD;
t find some fair Dulcinea, who will be content to think her-&#xD;
s lf happy with me,- the bats and birds may yet be frightened&#xD;
fom the corners of the' old castle in the mountains, and its&#xD;
cobwebbed halls may find new echoes, in the sounds of joy."&#xD;
" God speed you !" cried the Countess. " But I wonder will&#xD;
tl e Archduke ever 'tear himself from the Archduchess and&#xD;
1iramar, to seek adventure again ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JEWELS.&#xD;
" Ah, yes ! " said Lieut. Tegethoff; "do you not know we al-&#xD;
ready have in view a voyage to Brazil ."&#xD;
"And we are to be left here in quiet retirement?" replied&#xD;
the Countess inmnock anger. "But how very modest the Arch-&#xD;
duke is ! " she continued, as he and the Archduchess gave a&#xD;
listening ear to her playful raillery. "Did you not notice just,&#xD;
now, that he. spoke of the Emperor Maximilian as the great&#xD;
Maximilian ?"&#xD;
" He wants u to distinctly understand," said the Archduchess,&#xD;
who till now had been conversing with Count Zichy, that he&#xD;
lays, as yet, no claim to the title!"&#xD;
" As yet," said Lieut. Tegethoff. "His Highness has five years&#xD;
before him in which to strive against his ancestor. You know&#xD;
Caesar had done nothing before he reached thirty-five.".&#xD;
" And who knows what five years may do ? Who knows, Te-&#xD;
gethoff, Isolani, but we may discover a new world in our next&#xD;
voyage ?" said the Archduke.&#xD;
Of which," said Count Isolani, laughing, "we would take im-&#xD;
mediate possession, and establish thereon a kingdom, with His&#xD;
Highness as the ruler."&#xD;
" And certainly, Your Majesty," said Countess Kollonitz,&#xD;
turning to the Archduchess," would give us all honorable po-&#xD;
sitions in your court?"&#xD;
" Yes, yes!" cried the Archduchess. "You and Countess&#xD;
.Zichy should be my first maids of honor, and Count Zichy&#xD;
grand chamberlain. What a model court we should have!"&#xD;
"I would respectfully suggest," said the Archduke, smiling&#xD;
to its members in expectancy, "that we adjourn to the drawing-&#xD;
room. 'The night is growing chilly ; and besides, its after effects,&#xD;
the moonlight, I am afraid,is too conducive to sentiment, or&#xD;
rather sentimentalism, for so august an assemblage."&#xD;
The proposition of the Archduke met with a ready assent,&#xD;
and the evening hours were passed within the castle ; - a contim-&#xD;
nation of lively repartee, and unrestrained pleasantry.&#xD;
Dream on, happy hearts, in all the joyous fervor of the soul!&#xD;
Let no dark-wing'd messenger of Time 4in 'the bright vision,&#xD;
or cast a shadow over the fairy-like mirage of the Future !&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
T is an impressive thought, when, in contemplating the&#xD;
waving trees anc'budding flowers, that glorify the world&#xD;
around us, we bring to mind the truth, that the very&#xD;
I  spot of green sward upon which we stand, has been, at&#xD;
time almost exhausting the history of man, covered by the'&#xD;
rging waters of the rolling flood.; and that we, ourselves,&#xD;
'.th the people of "the earth, are directly and respectively de-&#xD;
ended from the Shem, Ham, and Japhet who were saved in&#xD;
e Ark of Noah's building. It isscarcely in the power of hu-&#xD;
an reason, to make forcible home-application of points and&#xD;
cts so remote; yet the great cosmogonic chain that encircles&#xD;
e universe, and .links the living present with the dead past,&#xD;
rnishes the data by which theorists, and archeologists solve&#xD;
eir problems, and give strength to the foundation, upon&#xD;
ich modern history builds its Temple of Antiquity.&#xD;
A subject worthy the mind of a Newton, it is, testing the er-&#xD;
ition of a Selden, to trace the nations of the earth from the&#xD;
eat one Father in Eden; to follow our first parents out of&#xD;
e beautiful' garden, with its silver-winding river, wandering&#xD;
ward in great grief and tears, mourning the loss of earthly&#xD;
ernity and bewailing their heritage of. sin and death; follow&#xD;
em, not as Adam and Eve of Biblical story, but as our&#xD;
ather and our Mother, erring, weak, and frail, their. human&#xD;
arts throbbing with anguish, and their souls bursting with&#xD;
ony at the weight of their punishment, as it first takes tan-&#xD;
ble shape, and confronts them, in the person of their arch ene-&#xD;
y, Death, whom they see gloating over the pulseless form of&#xD;
eir .well-beloved son, our brother Abel; and they all power-&#xD;
ss to stay his hand. In the distance they behold Cain in&#xD;
e grasp of Sin, fleeing from the bloody work of his fratricidal&#xD;
&#xD;
hand, bearing the stamp of a dark and evil destiny, upon a brow&#xD;
that, like Lucife 's, had lost "its god-like cast."  Continue&#xD;
with them, until -Adam and Eve themselves pass away from&#xD;
the earth, and their children's, children had multiplied unto&#xD;
the tenth generation, and had populated the earth; and then&#xD;
in the pride of their being and strength - for "there were&#xD;
giants in those days "- they filled the land with iniquity and&#xD;
-vain-glorying, forgetting to serve the Creator, so that "the ways&#xD;
of man pleased not the Lord, nor found favor in His sight ;" and.&#xD;
repenting that He had made man, God sent the destroying&#xD;
waters of the flood, that, abating not from fifteen cubit's depth&#xD;
in the space of one hundred and fifty days, swept 'from the&#xD;
face of the earth all record of life--whether it were of man, or&#xD;
beast, or creeping thing-save the chosen few, that were ordained&#xD;
from the dawn of time to become the great progenitors of the&#xD;
human family. Again, the historic record tells us, that, as time&#xD;
passed on, the memory of the flood grew dim in the hearts of&#xD;
those that again gave life to the earth, and they, too, began-to&#xD;
boast of their power, and gathered themselves in might together,&#xD;
and laid the foundat40n of their Temple of Folly. Alas ! how&#xD;
many human hearts even now, in vaunting esteem of the strength&#xD;
that lies in mighty self, doth similar deeds! But .God turned&#xD;
the work of the ancient fathers, to naught and laughed to&#xD;
scorn their efforts to reach to Heaven, as in confused amaze-&#xD;
ment they stood, and saw that there was One 'who ruled in&#xD;
power over all.&#xD;
The tree began to put forth branches; at Babel began the&#xD;
separation of the human race. Brother spake unto brother&#xD;
in strange accents ; and the child mayhap, knew not the&#xD;
voice of the father. From the land of Shinar, the Lord scat-&#xD;
tered the people of different tongues, throughout the whole&#xD;
earth.&#xD;
The classification of the language of the early nations, the ef-&#xD;
fort to bring order out of confusion, has been a task puzzling the&#xD;
brains of learned and erudite philologists for centuries past. They&#xD;
bring to us, as the result of their studies, and gleanings from the&#xD;
Biblical record of the Indo-European family, three great di-&#xD;
visions of tongues ; the Semitic, supposed to have been spoken&#xD;
by the descendants of Shem; the Aryan, and the Sanscrit ; these&#xD;
were enlarged and grafted upon, according to the development&#xD;
of human ideas and the social wants of man; and from them,&#xD;
came the classic phrase of the ancient Greek, the majestic&#xD;
tatial of the Roman, and later the smoothly flowing tones with&#xD;

which the modern Italian woos his inamorata , the sprightly&#xD;
accents of the versatile French, in which flash, and sparkle the&#xD;
brilliant bon mots of an Imperial court; and, too,-we forget not&#xD;
the Red man, who first roamed the hills of America, and pene-&#xD;
trated the depths of her forests before Civilization had pressed&#xD;

freedom; we forget not that, the Indian's rude Druidical in-.&#xD;
vocation, to the "Great Spirit " points likewise to Babel as its&#xD;
natal, day.&#xD;
From one fountain came all the devious streams of life,&#xD;
separating, like the tributaries of a mighty river, one. deepens&#xD;
and widens as it flows onward, fertilizing the plains and meadows&#xD;
through which it passes, until the song of the honest yeoman&#xD;
is heard echoing over its wide-spread waters ;- while another&#xD;
winds its sinuous course, away -away, losing itself amid the deep&#xD;
solitude of nature's uncultivated fields, beyond the reach of hu-&#xD;
man call with no echo save that of its own in laughter voice, or&#xD;
deep-sounding basso, as in some dark ravine its concentrated&#xD;
waters form a miniature Niagara;- both, streams of life flow on&#xD;
to the great ocean of Eternity, and there must unite again.&#xD;
Whether it be the Siberian on his native steppes, the Indian&#xD;
on. the Aztec plains ; the European gracing a modern court -&#xD;
one truth comes home, "all men are brothers! "&#xD;
The question still is mooted, and engrosses the attention of&#xD;
antiquarians, -how this New World was first populated. The&#xD;
course taken by the wandering tribes of Asia, when they began&#xD;
their journeying, with their faces turned to the Far West, has&#xD;
yet to be based upon surer foundation than mere conjecture.&#xD;
Leaving untouched, the-various hypotheses - for such they still&#xD;
remain, -by which different ingenious Orientalists have en-&#xD;
deavored to solve the problem; leaving to the intelligent read-&#xD;
er, who may feel interested in the point, to draw his own&#xD;
conclusion, and make his own decision whether the tribe that&#xD;
peopled first the 'American continent, migrated from Siberia&#xD;
across Behring's Straits, and thence scattered in time from Hud-&#xD;
son's Bay southward, through the tropical regions of Mexico and&#xD;
Peru, to the frosts of Patagonia; or, lending ear to the opinions,&#xD;
of Diodorus Siculus, Plato, and other learned ancients, who&#xD;
held that at one time there existed in the Atlantic Ocean a.&#xD;
broad island ; that the seas flowing' between it and the&#xD;
mainland Were not too expansive, to defy the lmited navigation&#xD;
of the ancient seafaring Asiatic;, who, in their voyages dscov-&#xD;
&#xD;
ered the same continent which Columbus.afterwards.claimed the&#xD;
honor of touching first ; that this fabulous island which lay be-&#xD;
tween, was finally submerged, cutting off the communication, and&#xD;
leaving only rocks and shoals to mark its watery burying-place,&#xD;
and they, too, in time were lost; - knowing neither the truth&#xD;
of this, nor the fact that whether languages, customs, manners,&#xD;
etc., of the aboriginal North Americans bear most resemblance&#xD;
to those of the ancient Hebrews, Hindoos, Phenicians, or Greek ;&#xD;
and not willing altogether to conclude with Voltaire and Lord&#xD;
Kames, who, finding irreconcilable  difficulties in the way of,&#xD;
every theory, "summarily disposed of the whole matter by as-&#xD;
serting boldly; 'that America was not peopled from any part&#xD;
of the Old World"'- amid so many contending opinions, we&#xD;
leave the whole, and pass on ; only suggesting that the knotty&#xD;
question will doubtless ever remain enveloped in the twilight&#xD;
of ages, and will form fruitful and profitless theme for specu-&#xD;
labion and research to the wise men of generations yet unborn&#xD;
though destined to be ever among the many things which God&#xD;
in His Providence keeps back from the eye of human wisdom.&#xD;
Brushing aside the dust and cobwebs that hang about, and&#xD;
obscure the history of the North American continent previous&#xD;
to the discover of Christopher Columbus, we find the single&#xD;
fact, that it was inhabited by wandering, barbarous savages.&#xD;
Further than this we know nothing. In the fifteenth century,&#xD;
after the discovery, we are told that in the New World civili-&#xD;
zation had almost entirely confined itself to the regions in the&#xD;
North known as Mexico; and Peru, in the South; a fact, rea-&#xD;
sonably established, when we remember that an agricultural&#xD;
people,  for such they were - would naturally locate in that&#xD;
portion of country where their pastoral labors were most&#xD;
bouitifully rewarded. In Mexico, and Peru, were found the&#xD;
grandest monuments of art, which was not unknown to this&#xD;
stranger people. From the glowing descriptions. given of&#xD;
their antiquities; the extensive cities of forty thousand inhab-&#xD;
itants surrounded and protected by strong.- walls; the many&#xD;
buildings of stone and- lime, with 'lofty white towers; temples&#xD;
of. worship, ornamented with painting and carving; with long&#xD;
flights of stairs leading out to the courtyards; the House of&#xD;
the Nuns at Chichen and the House of the Governor at Uxmal;&#xD;
their tribunals of justice, and table of laws, - all these relics of&#xD;
v .&#xD;

wrath upon their mighty cities.,&#xD;
History seems but to repeat itself. in regular cycles ; is ever&#xD;
assing around the same orbit. The first written ideas of every&#xD;

architecture, all the arts which Greece has given to the world,&#xD;
ad lived and died with them. In the olden time, before the&#xD;
European touched their shores, may not the voice of a De.&#xD;

which was ornamented by the skill of artists equalling, in the&#xD;
estimation of their people, Phidias or Praxiteles? Yes ! surely&#xD;
orators, warriors, statesmen, and artists, glory, ambition, and&#xD;
beauty had lived and passed away on the new continent, and&#xD;
the relics which are scattered over the hill-tops of Mexico and&#xD;

Southern plains were first settled by an ILdian tribe known as&#xD;
the Toltecs,, who, from an ancient city known as Tula, near&#xD;
the northern limits of -Mexico, dispersed themselves in the&#xD;
surrounding country.  The city of Tula, which they had&#xD;
well-nigh abandoned, was from time -to time- the nucleus of&#xD;
many nomadic tribes, none of whom held much sway. In the&#xD;
lapse of years, the Aztecs came from the North, at the com-&#xD;
mand of their god, which they bore with them in their&#xD;
journeyings, together with the Shekinah, upheld by their priests.&#xD;
An eagle guided th-eir wanderings, going, as the pillar of cloud&#xD;
by day, and of fire by!night, directing their course across the&#xD;
plains, that bear even now the Aztec name, until at last,&#xD;
drooping its pinions, and bowing its crested head, it rested on&#xD;
a gigantic nopal-tree; indicating thereby, that it had led them&#xD;
to the Canaan of their search ; that it had chosen the spot where&#xD;
they should build their altars, and offer their sacrifice. Ac-&#xD;
cepting the token, the Aztecs rested from their journeyings,&#xD;
and. laid the foundations of the primitive city of Mexitli. ;*&#xD;
which, as the Mexico of the present day, has been devoted in&#xD;
its offerings of human victims, to its guardian " spirit of war."&#xD;
After the settlement of the Aztecs in the country known as&#xD;
Mexico, we learn that they increased in power and resources,&#xD;
and extended their dominions, by the conquest of other tribes&#xD;
they found around them. They also had some knowledge of&#xD;
painting and sculpture, and were not novices in the science of&#xD;
government, nor ignorant of astronomy and geography; their&#xD;
knowledge of the latter, however, being of course confined to&#xD;
their- own wanderings. So, they progressed in civilization and&#xD;
strength, choosing their own form of government and their&#xD;
own ruler, until Montezuma, their proud emperor, was startled&#xD;
and dismayed to hear of the approach of foreigners ; men of&#xD;
strange aspect, of whom they knew nothing ; whose purposes&#xD;
were hidden, and whose intentions they suspected.&#xD;
Cortez and his little band came to the New World, and&#xD;
where they expected to meet naught but the wildest barbarism,&#xD;
were astounded to. find, as they penetrated the country, 'a&#xD;
people.that fell but little short, save in the knowledge of the&#xD;
true God, of those he had left behind in his own country.&#xD;
And here, let us pause a moment to note the important truths&#xD;
which are taught, not alone by the early history of Mexico,&#xD;
but by that of any country. There is an inherent principle in&#xD;

the human mind urging it to progress. Surrounded by all that&#xD;
is beautiful and soul-elevating in nature, free in moral and&#xD;
social relations, the controlling, reasoning part of man proves&#xD;
its power to come out of ignorance, and asserts the truth of&#xD;
the axiom, that "ideas are kings.". But we mark, too, the.&#xD;
striking difference between the mind and the soul. While,&#xD;
mentally, man may advance, Science is unable to tear the veil&#xD;
of darkness from the soul. God's own voice is needed, -,to&#xD;
dispel the mists that obscure the spirit's atmosphere. Chris-&#xD;
tianity comes alone by Revelation. Look to ancient ,history;&#xD;
and with wonder and amazement, we see upon richly carved&#xD;
altars,; whose cunning devices tell of the genius of the one who.&#xD;
conceived and executed them, - we see thereon, hecatombs of&#xD;
human beings, sacrificed to senseless idols; the brain almost&#xD;
perfected ; the soul, in the thick darkness of ancient polythe-&#xD;
ism. Such is Nature's teaching, such her power ! Hear ! O,&#xD;
ye false prophets, that would delude human hearts, yearning to&#xD;
worship a true God, into gross Pantheism -hear how inade-&#xD;
quate is your omniscient NATURE to elevate man to the highest&#xD;
state of mental and religious being!  It is Divinity alone&#xD;
that can send a glow through the ethereal spark that has its&#xD;
home in the soul. The infidelity of a Voltaire or Paine&#xD;
cannot cope with the mysterious, gentle workings of the Holy&#xD;
Spirit.,. Man cannot stay the progress of Truth; his efforts are&#xD;
futile before the feet of the great IAm!  "As well might the&#xD;
sunbeam lie folded in the curtain of Night, when the King of&#xD;
Day comes rejoicing in the East ; as well might the exhala-&#xD;
tions of the Ocean linger, when the Sun beckons -them to the&#xD;
thunder's home ; as well might the rosy flowers essay to sleep,&#xD;
when Spring winds her merry horn to call them from .their&#xD;
wintry bed," - as Unbelief attempt to hold the soul in dark-&#xD;
ness, when Jehovah hath said, " Let there belight ! " It hath&#xD;
been decreed in ages long forgotten, that all men shall believe&#xD;
men shallabeleve in&#xD;
Ohrist, and to Him all shall bend the knee ; and we know that&#xD;
Pantheism, and Buddhism, and Paganism, all that would' keep&#xD;
the soul in bondage, must vanish in time, and give over their&#xD;
power, for the "everlasting gates will be lifted up, and the&#xD;
King of Glory shall come in.!"&#xD;
.How plainly does the history of the Spanish conquest of&#xD;
Mexico furnish an example of the truth, that despotism&#xD;
is a worm at the vitals of any government, and will surely&#xD;
work its destruction! With a people, who, confined to their&#xD;
own material mind, gaining naught by attrition with the world,&#xD;
&#xD;
yet raising itself from barbarism, into-a high state of civiliza-.&#xD;
tion dotting the fertile plains of the tropical regions with cities&#xD;
which compared not unfavorably in grandeur, with those of the&#xD;
Old World ; startling the Europeans with their painting, and&#xD;
sculpture; -their aqueducts of extended length; possessing an&#xD;
empire whose archives, whose tribute rolls, codes of laws, po-&#xD;
litical and domestic institutions, geographical maps, records of&#xD;
historic mythology, sacred rights and ceremonies, which invest&#xD;
the Mexican capital with the same dignity, that the Eugubine,&#xD;
the Bantine, and the Twelve Tables of Rome, lend to the infant&#xD;
days of the Uity of the Caesars, - possessed of all these, this&#xD;
power and strength in his kingdom, yet with the fear and in-&#xD;
decision, that in moments of danger, and of trial ever charac-&#xD;
terize the heart of tyranny, Montezuma succumbed before the&#xD;
daring Spaniard, and yielded to a foreign power the city of&#xD;
Mexico.&#xD;
It is said1 of Greece, when she fell before the invinci-&#xD;
ble arms of Rome, and felt the yoke of servitude about her&#xD;
classic shoulders, that she redeemed " the disgrace of her po-&#xD;
litical humiliation by communicating the first impulse of&#xD;
intellectual refinement to the bosom of her conquerors;" and&#xD;
when the fires were extinguished on the altars of the Grecian&#xD;
Muse they were kindled on those of the Roman Goddess.&#xD;
Not so with Mexico ! Subdued, broken in spirit, reduced to a&#xD;
degraded vassalage by her conquerors,-she sank into a state of&#xD;
inanity, which,-from time to time, she has made efforts to throw&#xD;
off finds the inertia of her own mind, too great to be overcome.&#xD;
Of her colonial history, when began her Iliad of woes ; of&#xD;
the various revolutions, which, during the     seventeenth,&#xD;
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries have kept Mexico in a&#xD;
state of perpetual strife ; of the many changes, politically, from&#xD;
empire to republic, and the rulers, under whose auspices each&#xD;
lived and died - of these things, History furnishes such full&#xD;
and able accounts, a repetition here is needless. We therefore&#xD;
leave these oft-turned pages unopened, and hasten to that&#xD;
which forms our task; for it is of the blood, which has so freely&#xD;
flowed upon her soil in these later years, which has' made her&#xD;
truly a deep-dyed Aceldamc&amp;amp;; it is of the tragic deeds, of her&#xD;
misguided sons, who have refused salvation for their country,&#xD;
and have set the brand of desolation as a signet seal upon the&#xD;
frontlets of Mexican liberty, - it is of this, and above all of&#xD;
the crowning horror which forms the climax of the fearful&#xD;

&#xD;
account to be summed up in the end, that with sorrowful&#xD;
heart, we cone to speak.&#xD;
The last twenty years of Mexican history has been no change&#xD;
from the drama, which had been played upon her soil, since the&#xD;
foundation of a government was laid thereon. A constant&#xD;
warfare between the Church and the Liberal party, first one,&#xD;
and then the other in power ; each striving to gain everything&#xD;
for themselves and their own faction, has kept her trammelled&#xD;
in no small degree ; has forbidden and kept away foreign enter-&#xD;
prise, and bound in fetters the genius of her own sons. In&#xD;
the year 1859, it happened that the Church held the power in&#xD;
the person of one President Miramon, whose management of&#xD;
Mexican affairs, and particularly those which concerned her&#xD;
foreign relations and obligations, was most unfortunate. In&#xD;
1861 he was in exile; his place filled by Benito Juarez, of the&#xD;
army, or Liberal party, who assumed chief control, and thereby&#xD;
entailed upon himself, the settlement, if account happened to be&#xD;
called, of all the grievances brought against Mexico by her&#xD;
former rulers. These grievances wore the shape of very heavy&#xD;
sums, due to English, French, and Spanish subjects, besides&#xD;
outrages and insults, offered to the same, during the revolu-&#xD;
tions and. contentions that were tearing the country from year&#xD;
to year. It happened at the period last mentioned, that the&#xD;
troubles in Mexico were accumulating so rapidly, that the inter-&#xD;
ests of their subjects in her domain became a matter of serious&#xD;
concern to the respective powers. Perhaps the consideration&#xD;
of their subjects' good was more weighty with the European&#xD;
powers, since the time seemed propitious for forcing redress&#xD;
to be made ; for the United States, who had kept Mexico&#xD;
heretofore, as a nestling under the shadow of her wing, was&#xD;
absorbed in her own domestic troubles; for the Western conti-&#xD;
nent presented the unusual sight of a nation boasting the best&#xD;
government the world ever saw, sundered 'by dissension and&#xD;
strife ; a broken household -a divided Union ! The South&#xD;
declared that it was not possible to live in peace with the&#xD;
North; and it was given forth by her -sons that she was&#xD;
o longer a part of the United States. The parting of the&#xD;
States was not like that of the brothers of old ; the peace-loving,&#xD;
wrath-averting words of the God-fearing Abraham; "Let there,&#xD;
be no strife, I pray thee, between thee and me. Separate&#xD;
thyself ,from me. Is not the whole land before us?" found&#xD;
no ao wh te Nbor     at the warie segment, couched&#xD;
&#xD;
shall be preserved !" rang over the green hills of Vermont ;&#xD;
was wafted over the blue waters of the Northern bays; was&#xD;
echoed in the clarion notes of bugle and fife through the.&#xD;
metropolitan cities; gathering strength everywhere; until the&#xD;
booming of the loud-mouthed cannon, told that the "die was&#xD;
cast, the strife begun."&#xD;
It was at this period, when the "Bird of American Liberty,"&#xD;
whose gaze peers over the rocky heights of the West 'to the&#xD;
misty shores of the Pacific, found its pinions too small to&#xD;
cover its own brood, without offering wing to Mexico, that the&#xD;
commissioners of England, France, and Spain, after a confer-&#xD;
ence on Mexican affairs held at London, determined that an&#xD;
allied expedition should be sent to Mexico, demanding from&#xD;
the President, reparation for the insults, injuries, and wrongs&#xD;
which their subjects had suffered at her hands.&#xD;
Arrived at Vera Cruz, early in January of 1863, the ambassa-&#xD;
dors who had been sent to represent each power, and who were&#xD;
sustained by 7000 troops on the part of Spain, 3000 on&#xD;
the part of France, and a smaller number for England,&#xD;
lost no time in laying before President Juarez and his offi-&#xD;
cials the reason of their coming; and at once, set forth the de-&#xD;
mands made by their respective Sovereigns, which, though just,&#xD;
yet in the face of Mexican poverty were appalling.&#xD;
Nothing daunted by the .massing of the enemy'sforces, and&#xD;
the flood of financial embarrassments, which threatened to&#xD;
swallow up his government, 'Juarez, through his minister,&#xD;
Doblado, invited the ambassadors to a special conference to be&#xD;
held at Orizaba, where his policy would be; ".Come ! and let&#xD;
us reason together."&#xD;
At this conference, after a great fanfarado and assumption&#xD;
of mock strength on the, part, of Mexico, the treaty known as&#xD;
the " Preliminaries of Soledad " was agreed upon. It was rec-&#xD;
ognized as accomplishing nothing for the allies, but only pro-&#xD;
vided 'for further negotiations.&#xD;
While all this was going on in the republic, in Paris there&#xD;
was an agent at work upon a scheme that threatened to affect&#xD;
the destinies of Mexico far beyond the negotiations of these&#xD;
foreign embassies. General Almonte, a Mexican of high stand-&#xD;
ing, who had left his country years. before, had gained access to&#xD;
the Court of the Tuileries and to the private ear of the Em-&#xD;
peror of France; and his stories of the wealth and treasures&#xD;
rusting in the Western land; the great harvest wastingfor lack&#xD;
of those to gather it; fixed the mind Qf the monarch more than&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
ever upon the claims of France in Mexico; until at last, filled,&#xD;
with the idea of forcing Mexico to become tributary to France,&#xD;
at least until her demands were satisfied, the Emperor Napo-&#xD;
leon, by instructions transmitted to his ambassador at Vera&#xD;
Cruz, inaugurated a new policy ; and it became known to Eng-&#xD;
land and Spain, that upon the prestige of her superior and&#xD;
heavier claims, France had, decided to take the management of&#xD;
Mexican affairs, by force of arms or otherwise, into her own&#xD;
hands, until she should see fit to withdraw.    he   w&#xD;
The Emperor had been materially aided by Juarez himself&#xD;
who, with pitiable short-sightedness, had agreed, in the before--&#xD;
mentioned treaty, that until the close of the negotiations with&#xD;
the allies, their forces should be allowed to occupy the cities of&#xD;
Cordova, Tehuacan, and Orizaba, as well as other natural&#xD;
boundaries, so that the troops should not be affected by the&#xD;
trying clmate of the tierra caliente. True, it was agreed, "that&#xD;
if the negotiations were broken off, the foreign forces should&#xD;
give up these positions, and fall back upon the road to Vera&#xD;
Cruz; " but, ensconced in such comfortable strongholds, it is&#xD;
natural that these little points should have been forgotten or&#xD;
overlooked, when France ignored her obligation to keep the&#xD;
treaty; and President Juarez had the consoling reflection, when&#xD;
he found his chair of state tottering beneath him, and his ene-&#xD;
mies at his door, that he had himself helped them on their&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Seeing the policy of France, England and Spain determined&#xD;
to withdraw and leave her a clear'field, and gave instructions&#xD;
for the return of their troops, which resulted in their embarka-&#xD;
tion for Europe at once. In the meantime, France had sent&#xD;
reinforcements to Mexico; and her troops, then under com-&#xD;
mand of General Lorencez, were ordered to open the campaign,&#xD;
nd commence hostilities.-&#xD;
So ended the allied expedition to Mexico; and so began the&#xD;
rench movement there. Whatever may be the moral view&#xD;
f the question, no power in Europe can point the finger of&#xD;
eproach at France alone ; for although England and Spain&#xD;
thdrew, they manifested in no way, their disapproval of the&#xD;
action of their ally; and for the United States; the love for&#xD;
exico which prompted her to extend such, protecting care is&#xD;
bout as  interested, we think, as that of the goldsmith&#xD;
ho became enamored of the diamond eyes, of the idol of Jag.&#xD;
ernaut !&#xD;
&#xD;
lI['E Emperor Napoleon did not set on foot his plans&#xD;
for the establishment of French power in Mexico, with&#xD;
's     the entire approbation of iis Senate. In the Corps&#xD;
t Jegislatif, the Liberal or Democratic party was led by&#xD;
bold, outspoken men, who, when occasion required, dared to&#xD;
oppose and proclaim aloud their disapproval of the Imperial&#xD;
policy. These speakers or statesmen, were the more to be&#xD;
dreaded, since they stood in high favor with the people, and&#xD;
in a great degree controlled the vox populi.&#xD;
The meeting of the national congress of any country, is al-&#xD;
ways a matter of absorbing interest; and particularly so, when&#xD;
it is regarded, not alone with reference to the pomp and splen-&#xD;
dor, with which it is the pride of a people to adorn their council&#xD;
chambers and surround their statesmen, but also, as the gather-&#xD;
ing of a conclave of men, whose wisdom, experience, and talent,&#xD;
entitle them to be the representatives of a nation; and who are&#xD;
looked to, not only as the guardians of a country's liberty and&#xD;
peace, but also as the framers and enacters of laws, which shall&#xD;
advance a nation in civilization and Christianity.&#xD;
The French Chamber of Deputies lacks none of the magnifi-&#xD;
cence of ornamental adornings, with which Imperial monarchs&#xD;
strive to impress the people with the greatness of their Em-&#xD;
pire, and the statesmen with the dignity. of their position.&#xD;
There was the Seat of State for the Emperor when he opened&#xD;
the session; and near it, on either side, the ~handsome chairs&#xD;
occupied by the various Ministers of State. Farther forward,&#xD;
and below the royal assemblage, was the seat of the President&#xD;
of the Corps Legislatif; and then, came the desks of the mem-&#xD;
bers who make up that worthy body.&#xD;
These seats were not often filled all at once during the ses-&#xD;
sions. Many chairs could be found vacant, their owners pre-&#xD;
ferring the boulevard with its various excitements, to the dry,&#xD;
tedious details of business ; and as they did. not aspire to any&#xD;
higher honor than merely being known as "members"; (to secure&#xD;
which, they had no doubt paid well at 'their election), they&#xD;
contrived to shift the burden, on those who were 'willing to&#xD;
shoulder it, presenting themselves only upon the occasion of great&#xD;

speeches or heated debates, when the war of words was "really&#xD;
exciting!"  Others there were of this most respectable body&#xD;
who, it is true, could be oftener found occupying their seats,&#xD;
but when there; employed themselves mostly with their numer-&#xD;
ous correspondents, and finishing from time to time a huge offi-&#xD;
cial-looking letter, delivered it to the waiting page, who was. to&#xD;
see it safely mailed; others still, up too late the night before,&#xD;
perhaps, might be seen here and there leaning forward upon&#xD;
their desks, and yielding to the somnific influence of the voices&#xD;
around, assumed their true characters, as "sleeping members."&#xD;
But,as we have said before, there were not wanting' in the&#xD;
Corps Legislatif energetic, working men, who neither 'slept&#xD;
away, nor slipped from, the time allotted to their meetings ;&#xD;
but, alive to their duty, took part in, and gave attention to all&#xD;
the long, dry, knotty questions that came up; which, however&#xD;
troublesome to get rid' of, or tiresome to endure, must be con-&#xD;
sidered and decided by some one, either for the country's weal&#xD;
or woe.-&#xD;
The first session held by the Corps in 1862, differed in no&#xD;
wise from those of the preceding years. The opening day,&#xD;
when, in the presence of the royal family, the Ministers of State,&#xD;
and the members, the Emperor delivered his message, was, of&#xD;
course, a time when the Chamber was filled with a crowd of.&#xD;
curious, eager spectators; but after that was passed, and the&#xD;
body went into regular business sessions, its meetings from day&#xD;
to day were subjects of concern to but few besides the members.&#xD;
There are good reasons, however, why we should ask the reader&#xD;
to go with us to one of these meetings; and, if possible, to&#xD;
sten with patience to the discussions of French policies and&#xD;
diplomacy.&#xD;
It had been a long, dry sitting: first the Roman question,&#xD;
which had been left threadbare in 1861, had been taken up&#xD;
gain; then, the financial situation and embarrassments were&#xD;
11 engrossing. Bills -of relief were proposed and discussed'.&#xD;
amendments offered, and finally laid upon the table for further&#xD;
consideration. At last, the relation of France to Mexico came&#xD;
up; the all-absorbing topic of the day, the question full of&#xD;
interest to the -people, who were anxious to discern the real&#xD;
policy of the Emperor, and his true purpose in sending troops&#xD;
to America.&#xD;
SAs the subject of foreign relations was brought forward, the&#xD;
dull, heavy spirit of lethargy that had hun over the assembly&#xD;
was dissipated; and each member waited with eager attention&#xD;

&#xD;
the movement of M. Rouhher, who always set forth the Impe-&#xD;
rial policy. The restless spirits, who retired during the tedious&#xD;
details of business, now filled their seats; for they anticipated&#xD;
with pleasure, the clash of arms between the Democratic leaders&#xD;
and tfhe Imperial-supporters; and they knew that this Mexican&#xD;
question was too fine an opportunity; too advantageous a field&#xD;
for the display of oratorical strength, and forensic ability, to be&#xD;
neglected by the Goliaths of the House.&#xD;
Every eye was turned to M. Rouher, who had risen in his&#xD;
seat and opened the discussion.&#xD;
" Before entering, gentlemen," said he, "upon the particulars&#xD;
of our foreign relations, it would perhaps be well for us to&#xD;
refer again to the message of his Majesty the Emperor Napo-&#xD;
leon, a copy of which I hold in my hand; and which sets forth&#xD;
the Imperial views in regard to Mexican affairs, to the discus-&#xD;
sion of which we shall presently come. You will, gentlemen,&#xD;
have the goodness to listen to the reading."&#xD;
M. Rouher began the message in a deep, impressive voice,&#xD;
that sounded out clearly and distinctly in the large chamber,&#xD;
over which, hung a stillness so breathless that it amounted&#xD;
almost to solemnity. After dwelling upon the "prosperous con-&#xD;
dition of France, which, by the grace of God and the wisdom&#xD;
with which He had imbued her statesmen, still .held her high&#xD;
position among the nations," the message drew toa close;&#xD;
" We would not," read M. Rouher, "atethis time be at war&#xD;
with any nation, had not the actions of the unscrupulous Gov-&#xD;
ernment of Mexico compelled us to ally ourselves with Spain&#xD;
and England in order to protect our subjects, and to prevent&#xD;
further crimes, not only against the laws of nations, but those&#xD;
of humanity itself, which have been so cruelly defied and -out-&#xD;
raged. But in regard to this conflict across the water, France&#xD;
need have no fear ; since nothing can ensue from it to disturb&#xD;
her position, or shake her faith and trust in the future.. A&#xD;
truly Napoleonic non-committal document ! Such all who now&#xD;
heard it, with deep interest, for a second time, felt it to be.&#xD;
NI. Rouher took his seat, and awaited the opening of the de-&#xD;
bate.&#xD;
All looked now to another, who sat quietly listening to what&#xD;
was said. A keen, far-sighted diplomat he was; ever on the&#xD;
alert; from whom nothing could be. hid; who saw a deeper&#xD;
meaning in the nicely turned sentences and delicate phrases of&#xD;
the Imperial message, than was suggested, to the common ear;&#xD;
and who knew that the little cloud, which in the distance, hung&#xD;

over Mexico, and seemed so brightly gilded, would in the future&#xD;
bring tempest and storm, from the wrath of which, France&#xD;
would not altogether escape. With all the intrepidity and&#xD;
boldness of his nature, Jules Favres dared to express his opin-&#xD;
ion in the face of everything; and it was to him that all turned&#xD;
now.&#xD;
"Gentlemen;" said he in a voice full of. irony, as he rose,&#xD;
and turned himself towards the eager listeners, " you. have&#xD;
heard again our Emperor's confidential message! Truly, we&#xD;
are honored in being considered worthy of the very high com-&#xD;
pliment, he has therein paid us ! His Majesty has considered it&#xD;
unnecessary to tell us the truth about this little trouble across&#xD;
the water; which of course can be of no importance to the&#xD;
people ! . We therefore are free to draw our own conclusions;&#xD;
and perhaps some of us may strike upon the truth. Do you&#xD;
understand, gentlemen;- do the people of France under-&#xD;
stand, - this great overweening anxiety of His Majesty the&#xD;
Emperor Napoleon,just at this time, about'the claims of French&#xD;
subjects in Mexico? an anxiety that urges to measures more&#xD;
extreme, and demands more pressing than those of England and&#xD;
Spain, who have accepted the Preliminaries of Soledad, which&#xD;
France upon reflection has refused to do ; preferring to satisfy&#xD;
herself her own way? I will venture to tell you,; gentlemen ! "&#xD;
cried the speaker in a voice, that rang throughout they room;&#xD;
" for it shall never be said, that of all the men placed by the&#xD;
people of France as sentinels upon the watch-towers of their&#xD;
liberty, there was not one bold enough, to cry out in the face&#xD;
of the enemy, and give warning of the coming danger ! We&#xD;

est; I do but proclaim aloud, the end of the private conferences&#xD;
and meetings between General Almonte and the Emperor, and&#xD;
the truth of the mission - of the Mexican archbishop, Mgr.&#xD;
La Basteda, to His Holiness at Rome. For this purpose, and to&#xD;
further this plan, General Almonte has returned to Mexico un-&#xD;
der the protection of the Imperial flag. I am but giving now,&#xD;
gentlemen, tangible shape to the whispers and secret breathings&#xD;
not only of court-circles, but likewise of the people, who have&#xD;
caught the echo from the Tuileries. The time has come for the&#xD;
masque in regard to this matter to be dropped. The nentibn&#xD;
and connection of the Archduke Maximilian's name necessi-&#xD;
tates the declaration of the truth. It would have been better for&#xD;
France, when the first troops set foot on Mexican soil, to have&#xD;
declared her philanthropic intentions; and to have said openly,&#xD;
'We go to civilize Mexico,' than to attempt a deception so&#xD;
flimsy, that the merest child could see through it. No, no  let&#xD;
us give things their right names. France may call her epedi-&#xD;
tion to Mexico what she pleases; but if we are not mistaken, to&#xD;
the world it smacks so strongly of Cesarism, that they are not&#xD;
apt to mistake it's title!&#xD;
"I have but one word more to add; and that is; to beg you to&#xD;
remember in the future, when this Mexican campaign, which&#xD;
seems so plausible now, shall be abandoned as futile and un-&#xD;
profitable; when its sustainment becomes a heavy drain upon&#xD;
the French treasury, and there comes no return for the out-go-&#xD;
ing of French funds ; when the United States shall force .a&#xD;
peace, and then defend her Monroe doctrine; when the Emper-&#xD;
or finds himself on the eve of a war for his great Mexican em-&#xD;
pire, and shall end by ingloriously withdrawing,- for Mexico is-&#xD;
hardly worth fighting over, - then, when reproach is cast upon&#xD;
France, I beg you .to remember that Jules Favres never gave&#xD;
his voice in its favor ! I do not pretend to direct the course of&#xD;
events or to offer suggestions; but if the Emperor Napoleon&#xD;
places a .2uropean prince upon the throne of Mexico, he must&#xD;
be sustained by French troops until Mexico is strong enough to&#xD;
,   support him herself which Will be -never?/  I have therefore&#xD;
simply to add, that it would be better 'to count the cost of the&#xD;
building before it is commenced ! "&#xD;
To this defiant speech of M. Favres, which was received&#xD;
with hearty cheers, and the frequent interruptions of "Hear !&#xD;
Hear!" by his own party, M. Rouher himself made answer.&#xD;
" Our worthy friend," said he, with an inclination towards&#xD;
the last speaker, " seems to have mnaeked out as a line tf con-&#xD;

duct, an abiding opposition to the Imperial administration,&#xD;
In our last session, it was his endeavor to harass His Majesty&#xD;
concerning Roman affairs; and he now tries to find a strong&#xD;
point upon which to hinge an opposition to the movements of&#xD;
the French in Mexico."&#xD;
What if it be the Emperor's purpose to prevent the United&#xD;
States Government from absorbing the whole of that rich and&#xD;
populous country ? England has Canada ; Spain, her Western&#xD;
Isles; nd why not France, too, an Empire in the West ? Shall&#xD;
we stand mincing over questions of national rights, and what&#xD;
is due to Mexico, when she herself tramples upon and outrages&#xD;
the liberties of others ?  Talk of the Government of Mexico !&#xD;
To what period in her history can she point to an institution&#xD;
worthy of the name ? Ask our friend there, to point us to&#xD;
any greatness in the national chronicle of the country for which-&#xD;
he puts his lance in rest ! Show us her constitution, that has&#xD;
been found suitable to her wants ; show us her literature.; her&#xD;
scholars; men of talent and research, known to the world; let&#xD;
her works tell of the progress she has made in the study of&#xD;
those arts and sciences which elevate, cultivate, and refine a peo-&#xD;
ple more than aught else ! No ! gentlemen; you search in vain&#xD;
for (these things ; the darkness that hangs- over the soul of&#xD;
Afric's heathen children is hardly so tangible in its misty&#xD;
form, as that which covers and envelops the intellect of this&#xD;
Mexican people! . Mexico is dead ! She contains within her-&#xD;
self no life-giving, soul-inspiring principle; and she can be&#xD;
brought to life in reality and in earnest only by influences out-&#xD;
side of herself !  Could a country possessing, as she does, the&#xD;
vast wealth of earth embosomed treasures, if properly governed&#xD;
and developed, remain in the degraded condition in which for&#xD;
years past Mexico has been found.?  Torn by contending fac-&#xD;
tions; to-day the army,-to-morrow the church triumphant, each&#xD;
seems in their success viewing with the other in the blows they&#xD;
strike at liberty. Peace is an obsolete word; genius and talent&#xD;
are debarred from their free exercise, and are paralyzed by their&#xD;
political surroundings!".&#xD;
The question, gentlemen, now is brought up; how is an end&#xD;
to be made of all this warring in Mexico ?  Who is to come be-&#xD;
tween the antagonistic parties, and by dashing the hopes of the&#xD;
ambitious leaders of each, end the revolution, in reconciling&#xD;
both t6 the rule of one who is worthy and able to nlift u and&#xD;
ennoble their country and countrymen? Shall we of Europe&#xD;
stit idle and careless until the United States closes he I)r,&#xD;
&#xD;
and permit her to sweep over the South and arrogate to herself&#xD;
the jurisdiction of the whole country, from the Isthmus of&#xD;
Panama to the Canadas ?&#xD;
"PNo   entlemen! No true patriot, no true lover of France,&#xD;
who would see the arms of the Imperial Empire 'extend from&#xD;
land to land,' will raise his voice against this great event of the&#xD;
d y; for I tell you, in the face of all these high-flown prophecies&#xD;
o our clairvoyant opponents, that this Mexican Empire and&#xD;
its establishment will be the proudest leaf in the laurel crown&#xD;
o France !. By opposition speeches and movements we not&#xD;
o ily annoy, and hamper the policies of our Emperor ; but, trans-&#xD;
mitted abroad'as they are, they serve to give encouragement to&#xD;
the weak and turbulent Liberal party in Mexico, who will&#xD;
never yield while France seems to be so undecided. But France&#xD;
is decided! And we shall all live to see, and I trust to appreciate,&#xD;
the greatness of mind of the one, who conceived this plan for&#xD;
benefiting both France and Mexico!"&#xD;
M. Rouher took his. seat. A mingled sound of applause&#xD;
and hissing was heard throughout the house, which grew so loud&#xD;
and boisterous as each party waxed warm,.that the President's&#xD;
voice was heard calling loudly, " Order ! order ! " When quiet&#xD;
was again restored, M. Billault claimed attention. Rising in.&#xD;
his seat among the Imperial adherents, he lent his aid to M.&#xD;
Rouher in the defence of the Emperor's policy.&#xD;
1I cannot be silent," said he, "since I share our friend's con-&#xD;
scientious scruples upon that score," -with an inclination to-&#xD;
wards M. Favres, upon whose face lingered an expression of in-&#xD;
credulous irony - I cannot be silent, and feel that the people&#xD;
will be misled in regard to the Emperor's purposes. Do we not&#xD;
all know that France has insults to avenge, upon this Mexican&#xD;
Government? and shall we stand, in the face of the world, and&#xD;
quietly brook not only these, but the many outrages which Mex-&#xD;
ico has committed upon the personal property of French sub-&#xD;
jects ?  As for the United States which seems to be the lion&#xD;
in the path, she has her hands full just now; and can hardly&#xD;
afford, even for her boasted Monroe doctrine, to threaten out-&#xD;
siders. And for France's purpose in Mexico, she has no thought&#xD;
of forcing either a government or a ruler upon her. Her best&#xD;
citizens and the church party are anxious to join France, or any&#xD;
one who will relieve them from their present evils. 'Everyna-&#xD;
tion, according to the old Machiavellian aphorism, consists of&#xD;
three distant classes: one 'understands for itself; the second&#xD;
understands as much. as is shown to it by others ; and the third&#xD;

understands neither of itself nor aught that is shown to it --&#xD;
that is, literally, -nothing.' We think we hazard nothing&#xD;
when we say that classes two and three have the majority in&#xD;
Mexico; ' for we know that the mass of her population are ignor-&#xD;
ant and degraded, and will follow wherever they are led. - Not&#xD;
only His Majesty, but all thinking men, must see that the high-&#xD;
er classes of society - those whose property is insecure under the&#xD;
Protean changes of the Mexican Government, - will at once&#xD;
unite with the Imperial cause, and give allegiance to a ruler, in&#xD;
whose selection they themselves shall have a voice ; for when the&#xD;
Imperial flag floats over the city of Mexico, it shall be sub-&#xD;
mitted to Mexican8 to choose their form of government, and&#xD;
by popular vote to select their own ruler. Think what a future&#xD;
there might be, (and God grant there may be!) for that Western&#xD;
country, whose murmuring streams wind through uncultivated&#xD;
fields that might be Eden-gardens!' Think of the lovely val-&#xD;
leys and lofty heights that hug to their bosoms, with miser&#xD;
clutch, treasures which should be brought forth to enrich, enno-&#xD;
ble, and build up a government worthy of a spot upon which&#xD;
God has smiled so graciously ; and where Nature has showered&#xD;
her gifts with no sparing hand!- Aye, Mexico must-have banks ;&#xD;
must have railroads ; must have systems of education by which&#xD;
her degraded mongrel masses shall be elevated; and above all,&#xD;
she must have a ruler, who can give her all these great requisites&#xD;
to civilization! Can she find one among her own people ? The&#xD;
revolutionary element with her, is the destroying element ;&#xD;
and seditious conspirators, or. democratic demagogues, with&#xD;
whom self-aggrandizement is the impelling motive; who have no&#xD;
soul to take in the idea of national existence, dignity, or pride -&#xD;
these are not the men to be at the helm, to pilot the ship of&#xD;
state over the stormy billows of party strife ; or to lull the waves&#xD;
of private resentments into the smoothly flowing waters of peace.&#xD;
But, gentlemen, all this is, in the future ;, for the present, our&#xD;
plain duty is to give our hearty support to the plan of elevat-&#xD;
ng Mexico. Let us dismiss this carping, haranguing spirit of&#xD;
opposition, and show to the world that France can fulfil and&#xD;
execute whatever she purposes and undertakes !"&#xD;
One after another the "speaking members " expressed their&#xD;
sentiments m regard to the question. Now, some outspoken&#xD;
follower of the Liberal party brought down a round of ap-&#xD;
plause ; and again, there came the disapproving hiss from the&#xD;
opposite party. The debates were long and excited ; and were&#xD;
only ended by the adjournment of the House, when each muem-&#xD;
&#xD;
ber retired, unchanged in his previous opinion, and still urg-&#xD;
ing reasons for, or against the Imperial policy.&#xD;
But the man who was less moved than all others by the re-&#xD;
ports of these contentions among his statesmen, was the guide&#xD;
ing spirit, the Imperial Emperor himself; who only needed&#xD;
suitable occasion to prove that he had the firmness to repeat&#xD;
the decisive words of a kingly predecessor; "L'atat c'est eoil/"&#xD;
What cared he for the arrogant ideas of haranguing demo-&#xD;
cratic leaders ? They could not change his plans or purposes.&#xD;
By his own sagacity and boldness he had placed the Imperial&#xD;
purple upon his shoulders,, and right royally would he wear it!&#xD;
Opposition only strengthened him; difficulties and obstacles*&#xD;
made him only the more determined. There, he was a true&#xD;
Bonaparte ; he had conceived the plan of this Mexican Empire&#xD;
and by force, strategy, or diplomacy it should be carried outr&#xD;
Yes ; M. Rouher had spoken truly, "France, too, should have&#xD;
her Western possessions ! "&#xD;
What cared he, indeed, for the fuming and fretting of these&#xD;
men?   He held the power in his own hand; and by glorious&#xD;
success in Mexico he would awe into silence their clamorous&#xD;
voices. He had but just finished his Italian campaign; and&#xD;
had proven that he was no carpet knight, no royal dilettante.&#xD;
On the blood-stained fields of Magenta and Solferino, he had&#xD;
shown himself a practical as well as theoretical soldier; had&#xD;
taught his armies, that he, their Emperor, could not only legis-&#xD;
late for them, and study their interest in the ease of a palace,&#xD;
but could himself lead them to victory; and by his own&#xD;
knightly chivalry and prowess could gild more brightly the&#xD;
coronet he wore. He had, too, won the hearty blessing of&#xD;
the Holy See at Rome; for he had verified the truth of his&#xD;
promise to be the true protectorate of the Church ; and with&#xD;
masterly skill had neither given "Italy to the Pope, nor the&#xD;
Pope to Italy." And then, too, he remembered the meeting&#xD;
with the young Emperor Francis Joseph upon  the field of Sol-&#xD;
ferino, where he had wrested from Austria her Italian prov-&#xD;
inces, and sorely stricken her pride; and now, if he could es-&#xD;
tablish this empire, and obtain for the Archduke Maximilian&#xD;
a place at its head, he would have made some reparation for&#xD;
the injuries he had done to the proud House. of Hapsburg,&#xD;
which had received so many blows at the hands of France!&#xD;
So reasoned, in 1862, the royal monarch ; and with all these&#xD;
Weighing upon his mind, he no longer hesitated;&#xD;
but determined at once, to strike the blow at this most op-&#xD;

&#xD;
portune period, that should materially increase the power of&#xD;
France.&#xD;
Not only in' France, but also in Mexico, the Emperor found&#xD;
he was not without those to oppose his plan of progress. In&#xD;
accordance with instructions received from France, General&#xD;
Lorencez attacked with a force of five thousand men the city&#xD;
of Puebla, which lay in the line of march from Vera Cruz to&#xD;
the capital, and at which point the Liberals had massed their&#xD;
forces under General Zaragossa. Ignorant, and misinformed in&#xD;
regard to Puebla, its surroundings, and the feeling of its inhab-&#xD;
itants. towards the Imperialists, as the French troops were&#xD;
called, the result ,of the attack was a defeat to the French&#xD;
arms. It was a cruel disappointment to the French Emperor,&#xD;
but only served to make him more active. General Forey was&#xD;
sent with thirty thousand fresh troops to take command in*&#xD;
~Mexico, and General Lorencez returned to France. Notwith-&#xD;
standing the orders for an immediate advance movement,&#xD;
months were passed by the French army in marching and&#xD;
counter-marching ; an ill-judged procrastination, that only gave&#xD;
the Juarists time to prepare for resistance, and it was not until&#xD;
May, 1863, that Puebla was again attacked. In the .mean-&#xD;
time, however, France had found many adherents in Mexico.&#xD;
The Church party looked upon the Imperial cause with favor,&#xD;
since they hoped to gain from France their mortmain prop-&#xD;
erty, which they were in danger of losing forever at the hands&#xD;
of the Liberals. It cannot be denied, even by the strongest&#xD;
supporters of the Republic, that M. Billault was 'right; the&#xD;
better class in Mexico, -the property holders, - saw with joy&#xD;
not only Puebla, but the capital itself fall into the hands of the&#xD;
French. The reception accorded to General Forey and his&#xD;
victorious troops at the city of Mexico ; and the festivities that&#xD;
followed their arrival, could not have been entered into with so&#xD;
much zeal.and animation, by a people who esteemed themselves&#xD;
captives at the mercy of a foreign power; nor could it have&#xD;
been alone, the pursuance of a diplomatic policy - for in this,&#xD;
Mexico having no Talleyrand toteach her, the true application&#xD;
of language -has ever been found wanting.   However the&#xD;
question may stand ; Puebla, after,a short siege, yielded to the&#xD;
French, who, without resting on their victory, proceeded to&#xD;
march at once to Mexico city, where Juarez, the Liberal Presi-&#xD;
dent, still held position. Upon the approach of .the French&#xD;
forces, knowing that he could not hold his capital, he wisely&#xD;
&#xD;
retreated to one of the northern States; and General Forey&#xD;
took possession of the city.&#xD;
The goal having been reached, the French commandant and&#xD;
Minister, in conjunction with Generals Almonte, Marquez, and&#xD;
other Mexican dignitaries, proceeded to call a Junta or Coun-.&#xD;
cil of State, which, the principal personages of the country&#xD;
were invited to attend; as the purpose was to choose a form of&#xD;
. government, and a future ruler for Mexico.&#xD;
This call was answered; and under the auspices of these no-&#xD;
tables, the " Empire of Mexico" was established, or proclaimed.&#xD;
As the Roman Catholic was to be the religion of, state, it was&#xD;
decided, that the future ruler must also profess that faith. It&#xD;
was further believed that it was best for Mexico to look to&#xD;
a foreign prince for relief from present ills and security in the&#xD;
future ; - a prince of the line, formed by nature and education&#xD;
to think and work for a people's good. An. empire, supported&#xD;
not alone by Mexico herself, but by the united crowns of Eu-&#xD;
rope; with an emperor at its head accustomed to royalty, not&#xD;
raised from the common ranks of men, and "clothed with a lit-&#xD;
tle brief authority,"- such a government would secure to the&#xD;
country a firm and lasting prosperity ; and -Mexico would take&#xD;
her proper position among the nations of the earth ; and her&#xD;
voice, whether advocating the progress of art, science, religion,&#xD;
or laws, would-be potent in their councils. And for the ruler,&#xD;
he, must be the Brahma, before whose presence the Siva spirit&#xD;
of destruction and revolution would quail; and at whose com-&#xD;
mand Liberty and Freedom would descend in an Avatar upon&#xD;
the land !&#xD;
Such was declared to be the future in store for Mexico; and&#xD;
as the Emperor of France had set them thus far on the road,&#xD;
it. was thought by the Junta to be advisable to solicit from him -&#xD;
the suggestion of the person to be their leader.&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
O GUIS NAPOLEON sat alone in his private cabinet.&#xD;
)     Before him, on the large, heavily carved table, lay a&#xD;
confused mass of despatches and papers from all parts&#xD;
of the world. They had just been examined by the&#xD;
royal secretary, who, but a few moments since, left them for&#xD;
the Emperor's private reading.&#xD;
In his hand he holds a paper, whose contents seem to be of&#xD;
deep importance, and absorbing interest. A despatch it is, from&#xD;
General Forey, bearing date from the city of Mexico, and ad-&#xD;
dressed to the Minister of War at Paris. It brings tidings of&#xD;
the success of the French' arms across the water; and a smile&#xD;
of pleasure flits across the face of the royal diplomat, as he sees&#xD;
his ambitious dreams moving on to fulfilment. Yes; he would&#xD;
in truth, found an empire on the North American continent,&#xD;
that in time should equal in richness, splendor, and stability,&#xD;
the much boasted Republic of the United States; that now, in&#xD;
spite of its vaunted strength, was tottering to its very centre !&#xD;
And exulting in the thought of his future triumph, the Em-&#xD;
peror ran his eye again and again over the laconic despatch&#xD;
signed   FOREY:&#xD;
"A French column, under the orders of Colonel De la&#xD;
anorgue, is marching on Tlascala, with a Mexican detachment&#xD;
ommanded by General Gutierrez, who will establish himself&#xD;
t Apan. The troops of General Vicaris occupy Tlalpan and&#xD;
opepo. Some of the troops of General Marquez guard the&#xD;
mbankments of Guanhtitlan and Zumpange.     Colonel Ay-&#xD;
ard, of the Sixty-second, is in position at Pachuca; General&#xD;
eija, who has great influence in Queretaro, is going to that&#xD;
own with a sufficient force. Another column will soon go to'&#xD;
ake possession of Toluca. Lastly, the cavalry is stationed in&#xD;
he environs of Mexico, where it can easily find forage, and&#xD;
ssukg tranquillity.&#xD;
."By these arrangements I assure security in a rather exten-&#xD;
sive zone round the city of Mexico; and shall maintain my&#xD;
communications with Puebla uninterrupted. Nor have I at&#xD;
the same time neglected the occupation of the coast. -FOREY."&#xD;

&#xD;
General Forey had indeed proven himself the man for the&#xD;
situation in Mexico, and one to, whom the confidence and&#xD;
gratitude of France was due.&#xD;
" The eye of Europe had long looked with avidity upon the&#xD;
fertile plains of the Western continent, and dreamed perhaps of&#xD;
conquests there; but heretofore the immutable Monroe Doc-&#xD;
trine of the United States ad throw  it gr  shad   across&#xD;
the sea, and kept back all intruders. It had remained for&#xD;
France'to strike the death-blow to this absurd and arrogant&#xD;
theory, and to exhibit practically to the world its utter extinc-&#xD;
tion! "&#xD;
Such were the thoughts, that, for the hundredth time, ran&#xD;
through the Emperor's mind, as he fancied he saw the power&#xD;
of France safely and securely established in Mexico. "Yes!- he&#xD;
had solved a great problem; and he would clutch the success&#xD;
which had come to him with such unyielding grasp, that the&#xD;
fickle goddess of Fortune should never wrest it from him!"&#xD;
The Emperor touched a silver bell which stood on the table,&#xD;
and in answer to its sound, a page entered and stood in obei-&#xD;
sance, waiting His Majesty's commands..&#xD;
"1You will say to the grand chamberlain, that the gentlemen&#xD;
who are to have audience at twelve shall, upon their arrival, be&#xD;
shown at once to my private cabinet." A profound obeisance;&#xD;
the heavy door turned upon its massive hinges, and Louis Na-&#xD;
poleon was again alone. Rising from his seat, he left the table,&#xD;
trod over the rich carpeting to the window which overlooked&#xD;
the garden of the Tuileries.&#xD;
It was a lovely morning ! The sunlight lay in golden patches&#xD;
on the smooth green sward ; the flowers that were blooming in&#xD;
the gay parterres gave forth a soft breath of fragrance; while&#xD;
the overarching trees shaded delightfully the broad, graveled&#xD;
walks, that wound in and out through the labyrinth of flower-&#xD;
beds and grass-plats. Here and there, throughout the paradise&#xD;
garden, marble fountains threw up the diamond spray that,&#xD;
trembling for a moment with brightness under the glance of the&#xD;
sunbeam, fell at last timidly-into the limpid water of the basin&#xD;
beneath, where myriads of tiny fishes had their home. Hiding&#xD;
in coy bashfulness under the cool, inviting shadow of an ad-&#xD;
joining grove, was to be seen a marble dryad or hainadryad, peer-&#xD;
ing, it may be, from time to time, when all- is quiet and no one&#xD;
near, through the green vistas, at the distant form of some his-&#xD;
toric Grecian, that the nymphs had oft-times seen perhaps in the~&#xD;
forests of their own classic land, before the hand of some modern&#xD;

ong the shaded walk, and stop to linger beside a fountain,&#xD;
using or whispering, over the soft lullaby song of the falling&#xD;

penand the marshal of the household announces:&#xD;
c ci. Rouher! M. Billault!"&#xD;
"You lack the five minutes, gentlemen," said the Emperor,&#xD;
with something of haughtiness in his manner, as they entered&#xD;
and offered the morning compliments.&#xD;
"Your Majesty will grant us pardon," said M. Billault,&#xD;
"when he remembers that royalty has ever the precedence;&#xD;
even Father Time himself on his journey to eternity, or in his&#xD;
daily round, stops first at the palace, while we come after;" and,&#xD;
holding up a magnificent repeater, he displayed on its open face&#xD;
the hand but two minutes past the appointed hour.&#xD;
The Emperor received the pleasant sally with a smile, and,&#xD;
seating himself in a chair of state near the table, motioned the&#xD;
senators to occupy those which stood on the opposite side.&#xD;
"You are doubtless aware, gentlemen," said the Emperor,&#xD;
" that it is a matter of weight and importance, that has induced&#xD;
me to request your presence here to-day ; a matter which re-&#xD;
quires the immediate action, unity, and co-operation of all true&#xD;
and devoted subjects of France. As the opposition party in&#xD;
the Corps L6gislatif has done us the honor to again direct their&#xD;
efforts against the Imperial policy, we are anxious, gentle-&#xD;
men, that you who have so nobly sustained the part of the&#xD;
administration, and have battled so faithfully for the cause of&#xD;
civilization and progress, should be kept officially advised as to&#xD;
the success which France, as an instrument of these two prin-&#xD;
ciples, has achieved. Will you have the goodness, M. Rouher,&#xD;
to read aloud the despatch which has just been received from&#xD;
General Forey?"&#xD;
The two hearers listened with interest and-attention until M.&#xD;
Rouher had finished, when the Emperor was the first to break&#xD;
the silence.&#xD;
"The news, we see, is highly favorable ; and our most san-&#xD;
guine hopes;have been realized. Let ussee ;-" continued he, as&#xD;
M. Rouher unrolled a map of Mexico that lay on the table;&#xD;
"the heart of the Juarez faction was broken at Puebla, which&#xD;
city is now occupied by the French ; the connection between the&#xD;
capital and Vera Cruz can now be maintained. Juarez has re-&#xD;
tired to Nuevo Leon in the north here; his forces are scattered&#xD;
and disorganized, and without doubt will ultimately altogether&#xD;
disband. Mexico calls now for an empire aiid a European&#xD;
prince to rule her. In vain has she tried, under her own in-.&#xD;
stitutions, to give herself peace and order. Forty successive&#xD;

epublican presidents have made the attempt and failed.  I&#xD;
arnestly desire that not only the people of France, but the&#xD;
hole world, shall understand and appreciate the ideas which.&#xD;
ave urged us on, in this interference with Mexican affairs.&#xD;
or more than twenty-five years have we brooked crimes, in.&#xD;
ults, and outrages from the so-called government there; for-.&#xD;
earance has ceased to be-a virtue on the part of Europe; our&#xD;
ubjects ask for protection and redress; we have cut down the&#xD;
um, enormous as it is from long accumulation, which Mexico&#xD;
wes to France, and still Juarez fails in his promises to pay. A&#xD;
government that cannot sustain its obligations, must not expect&#xD;
t  be respected and esteemed as such. The object aimed at,&#xD;
t erefore, by France, is not to impose upon the Mexicans a&#xD;
rm of government antipathetic to them; but is to aid them in&#xD;
ei' efforts to establish a government which shall have some&#xD;
respect of stability, and of assuring to France redress for the_&#xD;
rongs- of which she complains."&#xD;
Your pardon, your Majesty;" said M. Rouher; 'every&#xD;
bject has its two sides,.pro and con 'and as they are always&#xD;
eely discussed by the public, it is also advisable that they be&#xD;
eely discussed between ourselves. You have, of course, al-&#xD;
ady heard the suggestion that the action of France in Mexico&#xD;
ill be regarded in an ambiguous light by the United States&#xD;
overnment; and the opinion is hazarded by some, that it may-&#xD;
t a quietus to her civil war; and that the North and South&#xD;
ay be induced to unite their forces to expel a foreign enemy&#xD;
om American soil. The breach, it is thought, may not be so&#xD;
ide as yet, between the Southerner's and their Northern breth-&#xD;
n, but a common danger might lay the foundation, of a bridge&#xD;
span it.. On the South, the first stroke would fall; so it is&#xD;
gued. An empire built up in Mexico, sustained by France,&#xD;
uld soon grow sufficiently powerful to think of further prog-&#xD;
ss; and Texas, originally Mexican territory, and which cost&#xD;
Srd fighting to win, might be demanded again, and the motto-&#xD;
i et a/rmzs is not among the forgotten policies of the nations.&#xD;
ntess an ally, France would be a dangerous neighbor to the&#xD;
Sth. I have freely, your Majesty, presented to you the view&#xD;
en of the question by outsiders. Of course, I am at all&#xD;
nes keenly alert and alive to aught that concerns France,"&#xD;
d M... Rouher, as he finished speaking.&#xD;
"These arguments seem   good, M. Rouher," replied the&#xD;
peror, "and we thank you for their suggestion ; but they&#xD;
&#xD;
can be easily overturned by others equally as strong. When&#xD;
the Convention was first held in Europe, at London, to consider&#xD;
upon the claims of foreign subjects in Mexico, the United&#xD;
Sates was invited to join it, as she was equally interested in the&#xD;
austment of the affairs of American citizens there. However,&#xD;
t at that period, her attention was needed at home ; and as&#xD;
the case stands now, we think France need apprehend no diffi-&#xD;
culty. The South is weak, and needs foreign assistance. We all&#xD;
know that quarrels between brothers, and family-difficulties are&#xD;
not easily reconciled; and so long as the South entertains the&#xD;
shadow of a hope of success, so long will she contend. A for-&#xD;
eig  all would be very welcome to her; hold out, therefore,&#xD;
te idea here to the Southern Commissioner of recognition, and&#xD;
hint at possible assistance, which, from the geographical posi-&#xD;
tion of Mexico, could easily be given, and the South is quiet."&#xD;
"And the North?" said M. Billault.&#xD;
"Strict neutrality is our avowed policy. France need prom-&#xD;
ise nothing, and there is no danger in non-committalism. We&#xD;
need promise nothing, as I have said, to either North or South.&#xD;
The United States will not commit so great a blunder as to in-&#xD;
terfere, in her present condition, with Mexican affairs; though it is&#xD;
an o pen secret, that she has always intended eventually to extend&#xD;
her domain to the Isthmus, and is-therefore remarkably interested&#xD;
in all that bears upon this future plan ;. but give the Empire&#xD;
of Mexico once established, a few years, and she can take care&#xD;
of herself. Now is the time, and the only time, before it is too&#xD;
late for Europe to prevent the future assumption of Mexico&#xD;
by the Government at Washington, by placing her in an atti-&#xD;
tude and position, to protect and defend herself. And I tell&#xD;
you,entlemen let the outside world attack us, criticise us as&#xD;
it may, I feel that this action is tQ be the greatest event of My&#xD;
reign; and I believe, as surely as we are here together, that in&#xD;
future years, the people of Mexico will bless the hand that was&#xD;
first held out to save them, and aid them in rising from, their&#xD;
moral and political degradation, and in bringing out of eternal,&#xD;
- as it seemed, - chaos and confusion, order and prosperity !&#xD;
The fact that Mexico can never be properly governed by a pres-&#xD;
ident selected from her own politicians,has been clearly demon-&#xD;
stiated by the history of that country for the last twenty years;&#xD;
it is but a monstrous record of intestine feuds, sanguinary strife,&#xD;
pillage, and peculation among both high and low. In a foreign&#xD;
prince lies her future safety;( and to this point we new come,"&#xD;

. And who does Your Majesty think best fitted to fill this&#xD;
important position?" questioned M. Billault.&#xD;
You are right, M. Billault," said the Emperor; "the position&#xD;
is important ; and it requires a- man of no ordinary ability&#xD;
to take it; the sea may be at first a little stormy, but a skilful&#xD;
pilot and a strong bark can breast the waves. There have been&#xD;
several names suggested : the Infanta Louisa Fernanda of Spain;&#xD;
the Count de Flandre of Belgium; the Grand Duke Ferdinand of&#xD;
Tuscany; and the Archduke Maximilian of Austria. Of these&#xD;
persons, the claims of the Archduke of Austria are the strong-&#xD;
est. First, because Mexico herself desires him; then, his con-&#xD;
nections with the Germanic house, and his illustrious ances-&#xD;
try ; and lastly, but, by no means least to be considered, the&#xD;
personal character of the man himself. We could not find&#xD;
among all the princes of Europe, one better suited for the posi-&#xD;
tion. When just verging into manhood, a member of the&#xD;
Austrian navy, he visited our, court at St. Cloud; and even&#xD;
then, he gave rich promise of the noble, accomplished man he&#xD;
has since become. In the Viceroyship of Italy, which he held a&#xD;
ew. years since, he displayed a skill and diplomacy in manage-&#xD;
mg the restless, revolutionary Italians, that would have done&#xD;
~redit to an -older politician. A descendant of the noble&#xD;
House of Hapsburg, as well of the great Charles of Spain;&#xD;
brother to the Emperor of Austria; connected by his mother&#xD;
with all of the Germanic houses; and by his accomplished wife&#xD;
with King Leopold of Belgium and Victoria of England, he&#xD;
deems the man for the place. Should he accept the crown,&#xD;
which, by the action of the Mexican council, will be tendered&#xD;
to him by formal deputation, he will bear with him the mate-&#xD;
d~al support of France, Austria, and Belgium, and the favorable&#xD;
mffrages of all Europe." .&#xD;
.-In offering the crown of Mexico to the Archduke Maxim-&#xD;
Lian, 'said M. Billault, "may we venture to ask is the Mexi-&#xD;
an empire to become in any degree tributary to France, or&#xD;
'w11 she be simply an ally?"&#xD;
"Mexico,"' returned the Emperor, " will be under obligation&#xD;
France, only so far as to cancel her indebtedness. France&#xD;
ustria, and Belgium will aid her by men and money, to sustain&#xD;
r empire until she grows strong enough to become self-reliant,&#xD;
hen the latter, of course, will be returned. France, of course,&#xD;
ill expect to recover all claims, as Mexico prospers. The con-&#xD;
ol of the French troops and other diplomatic affairs will be&#xD;
trusted to Mashal Bazaine, who is to take General Forey's&#xD;
&#xD;

lace in Mexico, and who will act in concert with the future&#xD;
Emperor, whoever he may be. Besides all this, the Archduke&#xD;
being a Catholic, will guarantee protection 'to the Church, and&#xD;
will therefore bear with him the blessing of his Holiness at&#xD;
Rome. So then, gentlemen, you see the whole thing needs&#xD;
action, only prompt action, for its accomplishment. I have&#xD;
given you the relations of France to the future empire ; and&#xD;
she will stand firm, let the world talk as it may!&#xD;
The Emperor, as he spoke, rose from his seat, and his exam-&#xD;
ple was followed by the statesmen.&#xD;
' "Yes," cried M. Rouher, "and the world may justify her ac-&#xD;
tions or not, as they please. It would take the morality of a Kant&#xD;
to discover a flaw in the question, and we may leave these delicate&#xD;
points to physiocratic philosophers or political amateurs ; to a&#xD;
Rousseau with his 'Du Contrat Social,' or to Paine with his&#xD;
'Rights of Man.' Each have given winning and specious, sys-&#xD;
tems of government, national and individual, to both high and&#xD;
low; but unfortunately, the same system of legislation will not&#xD;
do for the whole world. So, until some deep-thinking meta-&#xD;
physician devises the Utopian theory by which all mankind&#xD;
may be placed upon the same platform, and the pulse of each&#xD;
nation be made to beat alike -we are all left to choose that form&#xD;
which, in the opinion of the majority, is best suited to the&#xD;
country's peculiar wants. Mexico has made the trial of a re-&#xD;
public in the past ; in the future, she desires an empire. Who&#xD;
can say aught against it?, Your Majesty, we are united ; and&#xD;
shall, in the future, as we have done in the/past, lift our voices&#xD;
in favor of the Administration."&#xD;
Again, the silver bell is touched, and the door opened. The&#xD;
statesmen make their adieux and take their departure, and the&#xD;
Emperor is once more alone.  He sits again by the table, lost&#xD;
in thought. A resums of the whole case as it had been pre-&#xD;
sented to his adherents, passes through his mind, and occasion-&#xD;
ally a frown flits across the smooth, unruffled brow, that effect-&#xD;
ually conceals the state cares that sometimes press so heavily&#xD;
upon it.&#xD;
Louis Napoleon was honest in this interview with his states-&#xD;
men ; and he had put the case of the empire to them in the&#xD;
same spirit in which he had undertaken to assist in its estab-&#xD;
lishment. It was not so much thel love of conquest that in-&#xD;
spired him, but the hope of en~iching France; not in lands, but&#xD;
by bringing into the French treasury. the sixty millions that&#xD;
was due from Mexico. And then, too, it was not an idle&#xD;
&#xD;

CROWN JEWELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
thought -- that of making a people, of these semi-barbarous Mex-&#xD;
icans, as they comparatively were. And at that hour he did&#xD;
not doubt what the future of Mexico would be. The great mis-&#xD;
take lay in his miscalculation of the Mexican character. And,&#xD;
too, there was an error of judgment; as M. Favres had said, he&#xD;
"should look to the cost of the building."  Though the Empe-&#xD;
ror of France was the man to hold the reins of the Imperial&#xD;
Government ; though he knew when to tighten, and when to loose ;&#xD;
though he understood that the character of the French people&#xD;
was such that the State constitution must be changed and&#xD;
modified to suit the exigencies of the times ; though he knew&#xD;
that the same liberties that are given to the phlegmatic English&#xD;
would run the excitable, volatile French into mad revolution&#xD;
in a week - yet with all, this experience, with France and&#xD;
Frenchmen, he perhaps did not fully take in, the difficulty and&#xD;
peril of the work he had set himself to do in Mexico. .Some one&#xD;
has said in describing the character of this Emperor of France,&#xD;
that, "he was most venturesome in schemes of action ; he could&#xD;
set himself heroic tasks, and yet, when brought face to face&#xD;
with the danger of performance, his heart quailed."  It was&#xD;
called a libel -- truthfully or falsely ?  Qui vinra verra. Years&#xD;
will tell; and the -verdict to-day and to-morrow, may differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.'&#xD;
&#xD;
HILE England, Spain, and France were at work in&#xD;
Mexico, and the latter power was speeding the 'time&#xD;
when the man and the hour should meet, the Arch-&#xD;
duke Maximilian had gone out from the quiet retire-&#xD;
ment of Miramar and had again tempted the ocean wave. The&#xD;
good ship Elizabeth had borne him over the deep to the shores&#xD;
of the Western World; where the heir of the royal house of&#xD;
Braganza was building up an empire in Brazil, that well-nigh&#xD;
overshadowed in strength and prosperity, the Portugal of&#xD;
Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
During the absence of her husband upon this voyage, the&#xD;
Archduchess preserved at her sea-girt castle a ,Penelope se-&#xD;
clusion; passing her time in the companionship of her friends,&#xD;
the Countess Zichy, the Countess Kollonitz, and the other&#xD;
ladies-in-waiting. She also gave many hours to her art studies ;&#xD;
and acquired unusual proficiency in the use of the pencil and&#xD;
the brush.&#xD;
Time slipped away ; and at last, the rolling months brought&#xD;
the period for the wandere's return. Scarcely had he touched&#xD;
the shores of the Old World, before he heard his own name&#xD;
everywhere in connection with the future Mexican empire ;&#xD;
and shortly' after his arrival at Miramar he was the recipient&#xD;
of a communication sent by His Majesty, Napoleon of France,&#xD;
urging his acceptance of the crown, which would soon be pre-&#xD;
sented to him by a Mexican deputation. The Emperor at the&#xD;
same time, gave full and ample promise of support and aid to&#xD;
the said empire; hoping, thereby, to favorably influence the&#xD;
Archduke's decision.&#xD;
Already had the press, not alone of France and England,&#xD;
but also of Germany, begun to hazard speculations as to the&#xD;
Prince's decision ; and, after the fashion of editors and know-&#xD;
ing men, were wrangling over points on which they were pro-&#xD;
foundly ignorant, having scarcely heard, or seen the shadow of&#xD;
the truth. One all-wise oracle gave a determined, unappeala-&#xD;
ble negative to the possibility of the Archduke's acceptance :&#xD;
" A prince of the House of Hapsburg accept a crown from&#xD;
France ! and more than all, from the hand and through the&#xD;
influence, of the arrogant 'Napoleon, who had wrested Lom-&#xD;
bard , from Austria !.! The thought was preposterous; .and&#xD;
was an insult not only to the Archduke, but to the entire royal&#xD;
house !"&#xD;
The leader of another journal urged, that "it was a glorious&#xD;
destiny for the descendant of the Spanish King Charles to&#xD;
again bring back Mexico to monarchical rule; and, moreover,&#xD;
the French Emperor, in using his influence, (for it was 7Mexico&#xD;
that offered the crown) in favor of the Archduke, desired to&#xD;
conciliate Austria, and she would- confer the honor, not only&#xD;
upon Mexico, but upon France, if the Archduke accepted."&#xD;
The echoes of these sage conclusions, vouchsafed by the great&#xD;
oracles who, each with their own especial corps,.constituted a pow-&#xD;
ful Sanhedrim, worthy of due regard, did not in the least 'dis-&#xD;
~ concert the one most nearly interested, who, in the quiet of his&#xD;

castle-home, considered the decisive question in all its bear-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
With Maximilian, it was the moral point that might be&#xD;
involved that weighed most heavily. He could never consent,&#xD;
ambitious as he was, to go to a country and assume the reins&#xD;
of government, unless convinced that the people desired it.&#xD;
He would not take the role of a foreign usurper ; nor should&#xD;
the world regard him in that light.&#xD;
A great struggle arose in the mind of the Archduke. Young,&#xD;
talented, and ambitious, with the power to bear the palm aloft,&#xD;
the temptation to accept this crown, on any terms, was terri-&#xD;
ble. He had but to put forth, his hand, and it was his, And&#xD;
yet, within his inner soul, he could not hush the whisperings&#xD;
of the still small voice that asked, "Is it right'?"&#xD;
Alone in the garden at Miramar ; treading in solitary sentinel-&#xD;
ship the high parapet that overlooked the blue waters of the&#xD;
sea; or, standing on the pebbly beach; against which the tiny&#xD;
wavelets dashed in infantile wrath; by \ daylight, in the sun's&#xD;
broad glare; or, under the soft, witching light of the never-weary&#xD;
stars, whose gentle rays fell tenderly upon him; trusting to the&#xD;
influence of nature and of God, Maximilian sought to make&#xD;
the true choice.&#xD;
Ambition whispered " Go ! " Yet, as Je trod his lonely watch,&#xD;
and oft-times looked upon his home in all its wild, picturesque&#xD;
beauty, where he was happy in the companionship of his&#xD;
friends, his books, and, above all, of the beautiful wife that&#xD;
idealized his life, the thought would present itself, that perhaps&#xD;
it would be better to subdue the restless longing in his bosom,&#xD;
for. nobler action and higher fields, on which to display the&#xD;
powers that were accorded to him    powers and spiritual&#xD;
gifts, that are vouchsafed only to a chosen few. Perhaps it&#xD;
would be best for him to still the voice in his heart that urged&#xD;
him onward, and content himself to remain at Miramarr and&#xD;
to wait. Wait !, For what?   Wait, till Death came to seek&#xD;
him out, and to find.him, at the end of a green old age, and an&#xD;
uneventful life, with his one talent hid in a napkin; and while&#xD;
he went with the Old Reaper, up above, to lay it before the&#xD;
Great Judge that sitteth upon the Throne, the loyal Austrians&#xD;
and his countrymen below would chant as custom, and perhaps&#xD;
love, in the hearts of a feW would bid them do; and they would&#xD;
lay him, "happy Prince !" beside his ancestors in the old church&#xD;
of the Capuchins, ,and- his life would be ended ; the only&#xD;
earth-life he should ever have in which to do his work, and&#xD;
&#xD;
it --it had been a failure ! And then, amid these dreamings,&#xD;
there would come to him that weird, strange voice, half wild,&#xD;
and fearsome, that oft-times speaks 'from  the other world-&#xD;
the land of mists, it may be - to the soul of genius, asking&#xD;
in tones of terrible earnestness; "Is this to be your life?&#xD;
always to hunger, and never be fed? always to struggle, and&#xD;
never attain? always to see the crown shining brightly, and&#xD;
never to wear it ? "&#xD;
"We are born; we laugh, we weep;&#xD;
We love, we droop, we die I .&#xD;
Ah 1 wherefore do we laugh or weep ?&#xD;
Why do we live, or die?2&#xD;
Who knows that secret deep?2&#xD;
Alas! not&#xD;
We toil through pain and wrong,&#xD;
we fight -and fly ;&#xD;
We love; we lose; and then, ere long,&#xD;
Stone-dead we lie.&#xD;
0 Life! isall thy song&#xD;
Endure and die? "&#xD;
Art thou content ?   Alas ! weak spirit !  Back to thy idols&#xD;
of luxury and ease ! Perish ! in their worship !&#xD;
No, no! " cried.the Archduke; "it must not be !.- Are&#xD;
there not men selected by Fate, as chosen vessels, - workers&#xD;
to accomplish her purposes 'on the earth ?     Does she not,&#xD;
even from their birth, guide them, and force them, if need be,&#xD;
into the paths they are to tread ? And though they may strive&#xD;
against this controlling principle ; though they plant themselves&#xD;
in blind rebellion, and fling a mad defiance in her face,:;they&#xD;
are as powerless as the withered leaf before the winter's storm.&#xD;
Circumstances will gather around them, sometimes leading,&#xD;
sometimes driving them forward to their labor ; and when that&#xD;
is done; when their work is performed, there comes the rest&#xD;
that is promised; and for the memorial of duty there is for&#xD;
all simply the " Hic jacet ! "&#xD;
"He does well who does his best.&#xD;
Isheweary?2 Lethimrest"&#xD;
What is to be, will be !&#xD;
The Archduke, impressed with strong faith in an over-&#xD;
ruling power ; confident in the belief of a "Divinity that&#xD;
shapes our ends," seemed to see in this offering of a crown, the&#xD;
finger of Destiny pointing him to pursue the path for which&#xD;
he had been prepared.&#xD;
" To be or not to be ?" that was the question which must be&#xD;

decided before the arrival of the deputation, that had already&#xD;
reached Paris from Mexico, and would soon be at Miramar.&#xD;
Maximilian did not trust the decision to himself alone; did&#xD;
not rely upon his own judgment, to the exclusion of that of&#xD;
others. Though possessed of fine perceptive powers; a keen&#xD;
penetrat on into the future; and a will to execute and carry&#xD;
out, if possible, whatever he undertook ; yet, at this momen-&#xD;
tous period, he sought advice of others whose wisdom and ex-&#xD;
perience entitled them  to high consideration. The spirit of&#xD;
the Archduke was high and lofty; and he feared lest his am-&#xD;
bition, recently fired by seeing what a Spanish prince had done&#xD;
in Brazil might get the better of his-reason, and mislead him&#xD;
in the, face of the world.                           h&#xD;
In his own family at Vienna there was a diversity of feel-&#xD;
ing. The Emperor, Franz Joseph, influenced by the consider-&#xD;
ation, perhaps, that France, had so much to do with it, looked&#xD;
with distrust upon the whole proceeding; while the others&#xD;
hailed with, joy another road to greatness, that was preparing&#xD;
for one o:-their house.&#xD;
King Leopold of Belgium, the Archduke's august father-in-&#xD;
law, who was regarded as the wisest monarch of Europe, gave&#xD;
his voice in favor of the acceptance of the crown; and the&#xD;
Archducl ess Carlotta too, into whom the spirit of greatness&#xD;
and ambition had been breathed from her infancy until it had&#xD;
become almost second nature, was eager to see her husband oc-&#xD;
cupy a position which she felt he would fill with so much&#xD;
honor; and her woman's pride and her woman's. heart beat&#xD;
high with the resolve, that she inwardly made, to be worthy of&#xD;
her place as an Emperor's wife.&#xD;
Often and often, in the privacy of their elegant library at&#xD;
Miramar, adorned as it was with books, paintings, and statues,&#xD;
did they discuss their f ure as connected with this great turn-&#xD;
ing point in their life.&#xD;
Between Maximilian and Carlotta there was that intimacy of&#xD;
thought, and unity of -feeling  that oneness which is the great&#xD;
end of marriage; oneness .of purpose, and of action - which&#xD;
gives to each a double strength. When Maximilian was weary,&#xD;
and perhaps despairing, she was full of hope ; and if the light&#xD;
in Carlotta's soft eyes' grew less bright, there was a tender&#xD;
smile that could recall their look of gladness.&#xD;
"In retrospecting our life, Maximilian  our life together, I&#xD;
mean,' said the Archduchess, as the two sat one morning&#xD;
alone, "for short as the time has. been, it constitutes a blessed&#xD;
&#xD;
1:1&#xD;
&#xD;
past, -.it seems that we are borne asa leaf on the changing&#xD;
breeze; first in Italy; then to Miramar; and now perhaps away&#xD;
to Mexico!'"&#xD;
"Where," replied the Archduke, " if destiny leads us, I&#xD;
trust we shall build our last shrine, and set up our material Lares.&#xD;
Retrospection and introspection are both, my darling, good&#xD;
teachers in this life. The first shows us already that the day&#xD;
laborer, who knows that the State will not call him from his&#xD;
home and bid him go hither or thither, is more a free man than&#xD;
the Prince, who is the servant of expediency; who, when the&#xD;
exigency requires, and the call is made, must go, whatever re-&#xD;
grets are left behind. But tell me, Carlotta, do you begin to&#xD;
fear the change, that we may perhaps make ?  There is a sad-&#xD;
ness in your voice I have not heard before. Do your eyes fill&#xD;
with tears, and your heart with grief, lest we may not find&#xD;
again an Eden-home like this we leave?" He gently passed&#xD;
his arm about her, and drew her nearer to him  on the sofa&#xD;
where they sat.&#xD;
"No, no, Maximilian ! I want to see a crown upon your&#xD;
head. My husband, I want the world to know what manner&#xD;
of man you are ; to know you, as I do ; to -know and see the&#xD;
high, lofty aims of life; the generous love which will be ex-&#xD;
tended to a people. I want the world to understand and ap-&#xD;
preciate the mighty intellect that will -found, and build up an&#xD;
empire that shall challenge.in greatness the powers of Europe&#xD;
and America. . And for our home," continued "Carlotta, look-&#xD;
ing up, first at the frescoed walls adorned with beautiful paint-&#xD;
ings and tiny statuettes; and then, through the open window, at&#xD;
the lovely garden, rich in flowers, deepening in the distance into&#xD;
a curtain of verdure, gilded and brightened by the magic touch of&#xD;
Autumn's finger, " and for our home, - I.can leave that with&#xD;
few regrets; since I know that it is for your good, for I have&#xD;
learned," -and her voice grew softer as she spoke the gentle&#xD;
words,&#xD;
And home without thee cannot be"'&#xD;
"Then, Carlotta," whispered the husband, "you have felt&#xD;
my absence in these months past; you have given a thought to&#xD;
the one gone ? "&#xD;
" Felt your absence ? " said the Archduchess reproachfully.&#xD;
"Maximilian, do you know what it is - to look upon beauty&#xD;
around, about you, all unheeding ; to listen to magic strains&#xD;
that'others call heavenly, and hear no melody ; to smile, and&#xD;

feel no gladness ; to breathe, yet feel no gentle heart beating ;&#xD;
and then when one voice falls upon the ear ; when one pres-&#xD;
ence comes radiant with light, like the glance of the sun upon&#xD;
the frozen water, to feel the spell broken; and where before all&#xD;
was insipid dullness, and aching vacancy, to recognize with&#xD;
your own soul, the spirit of happiness and joy ?"&#xD;
" The fountain of love in my heart, Carlotta," said Maxi-&#xD;
milian jofully, "has gushed forth at your gentle command ; and&#xD;
its dancing spray is leaping high and joyfully, glistening like&#xD;
diamond drops before its queenly fairy-! Ah! it is indeed&#xD;
sweet to know&#xD;
"'There is an eye will mark&#xD;
Our coming, and grow brighter when we come.'&#xD;
God has indeed kept from. us children, but it was because&#xD;
He, knew that we were complete to each other without. Be-&#xD;
lieve me, Carlotta, if we go to Mexico; whatever sacrifices and&#xD;
regrets you leave behind shall be repaid doubly by future de-&#xD;
votion, God being my helper!"&#xD;
" No,   aximilian," replied the wife. " I desire no credit&#xD;
for sacrifices I do not make; no rewards that I do not deserve ;&#xD;
since it is a privilege, nay a pleasure, to lend my weak powers&#xD;
to elevat my husband, not in nature, but in position. If a&#xD;
fear or anxiety creeps into my heart it is not 'for myself, not a&#xD;
romantic clinging to Miramar ; but it is perhaps a dread lest&#xD;
the people, who seem now so graciously inclined toward you,&#xD;
may prove   treacherous in the future; for we know that this&#xD;
beautiful land has been deluged with the blood of both Mexi-&#xD;
cans and their rulers."&#xD;
" Carlotta, in our own hands, I think, we may place our&#xD;
safety. They are fallen now from their high estate, but we&#xD;
must lift them up. We shall go to them-if they see fit to call&#xD;
us, not as strangers ; they must be our own people. Our task&#xD;
will be heavy ; there will be no resting in in-glorious ease : it&#xD;
will be labor; yet will we not welcome it joyfully.? There is&#xD;
a nobleness, a sacredness, in working for a high purpose; truly&#xD;
did the old monks speak,. "Laborare est orare," - "Work' is&#xD;
worship." Give a man a life purpose, and write upon his&#xD;
heart that divine precept, "What thy hand finds to do; do that&#xD;
with all thy might," and then do you breathe into his soul the&#xD;
true celestial spirit ; the sacred, purifying, deifying principle, that&#xD;
is not content, save as it rids the man of the ignorance, the&#xD;
prejudice, the blindness that clings to those who drag the gar-&#xD;
ments of the soul through the dust of the earth. It is this&#xD;
&#xD;
that these Mexicans, need ! Work ! Work for the body and&#xD;
the soul; and should it be:our destiny to rule over them, we&#xD;
ourselves will set them an example; we will give them not only&#xD;
the work to do, but will show them  how to do it. Oh! if&#xD;
Mexico will but help herself now as she did in times long past,&#xD;
what a future there is in store for her! " You remember her&#xD;
greatness at the time of the Spanish conquest; " and rising, the&#xD;
Archduke walked to a case of books, and opening the glass&#xD;
doors, took down the Abb6 Clarigero's Stori Antica del&#xD;
Messica,'and resuming his seat, read to the Archduchess that&#xD;
author's description of the ostentation and splendor with&#xD;
which the Mexican despot surrounded himself; ending with&#xD;
the magnificence of his palace;, and the pomp and circumstance&#xD;
with which his.daily household routine was conducted.&#xD;
"Montezuma was a heartless tyrant ; " said the Archduke,&#xD;
as he closed the volume," with no regard for the life or liberty&#xD;
of his subjects; and though we turn with* disgust from the&#xD;
accounts of the human sacrifices annually offered, yet we -catch&#xD;
an idea of the resources of the country even at that early day ;&#xD;
for until Cortez came, Mexico was confined to herself, to supply.&#xD;
all her wants. If then, she produced architects, artisans,&#xD;
civil and political institutions, and rose to such comparative&#xD;
grandeur, what may she not do now in-the nineteenth century,&#xD;
with the light of civilization full upon her? Ah ! it warms&#xD;
my very heart's blood to think that it may be in my power,&#xD;
that it may be for me, a descendant of that great Spanish king&#xD;
who united in himself the crowns of Germany and Spain, to work&#xD;
out this future for Mexico ! I remember the time when, just as I&#xD;
was verging into manhood, I visited the court at Madrid, and all&#xD;
the places of interest in that palatial city. It was not the&#xD;
State meetings of La Cortes, the national junta.of Spain; nor&#xD;
the lifuseo, where are collected the most glorious.gems of the&#xD;
old masters ; where Murillo and Velasquez, Raphael and&#xD;
Michael Angelo, Titian, and Corregio, are represented by the&#xD;
boldest creations of their genius. Wonderful as they were to&#xD;
look upon, they had not the charm to hold me there ; for my&#xD;
heart drew me to the royal armory, where hung the antique&#xD;
coats of mail as worn in the time of the Cid and the latest period&#xD;
of their use. There was to be seen the armor of the great Co-&#xD;
lumbus, who gave a new world to the nations ; black and white&#xD;
it was, with silver mountings ; there, too, resting as motionless&#xD;
against the dark wall as the mouldering bodies of those who&#xD;
had worn them lay inrthe earth, hung the various suits of&#xD;

But I weary you, Carlotta, with these old reminiscences; a&#xD;

my decision. When Mexico herself calls us, and we feel that&#xD;

of his words, had risen from his seat, and stood before her, his&#xD;
earnest eyes flashing with unwonted fire, and his voice tremu-&#xD;

soul's echo, "if it please God that we go to Mexico, I feel that&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
RIGHTLY, the waters that ebbed and flowed around&#xD;
the palace of Miramar danced in the sunlight.. Gently,&#xD;
the morning dew-drops kissed the tender, blushing&#xD;
flowers that hid in the sheltered garden-nooks ; and&#xD;
softly, the perfumed breeze stole outward o'er the sea.&#xD;
Noiselessly and silently the car of Time, guided by the hand&#xD;
of Destiny, rolls onward; the goddess within little caring for&#xD;
what she dispenses in passing, to the " toilers of the eaith." To&#xD;
the chosen few who stand upon her right hand, are given golden&#xD;
treasures and the wedding garment; but for the hapless myriads&#xD;
that crouch tremblingly on the left, beneath the uplifted rod, for&#xD;
them sackcloth and ashes, and the crown of thorns. So pass&#xD;
blessings and burdens; smiles and tears !&#xD;
The messenger of Destiny had come, this glad autumnal&#xD;
morning, to the palace of Miramar ; bearing in one hand a&#xD;
sceptre, and in the other a glittering crown, and had laid them&#xD;
at the feet of the lord of the castle.&#xD;
The Commissioners sent from the Mexican capital to offer&#xD;
these tokens of power to the Archduke Maximilian of Austria,&#xD;
were received at Miramar with respect, ceremony, and courtesy,&#xD;
though with no display.&#xD;
The library of the palace had been fitted up as a reception-&#xD;
room; and it was there that the Archduke received the depu-&#xD;
tation. By his side, were the friends who felt in his future&#xD;
solemn, deep interest. There was Count Zichy, .the chamber-&#xD;
lain of his'palace, likewise a true and tried friend; Count Iso-&#xD;
lani, the one'"1to whom the shadows of long years extended; "&#xD;
and Tegethoff, who looked with mingled gladness and regret&#xD;
upon the solemnities of the occasion; gladness to bee honors&#xD;
offered to one so worthy ; and regret, that the companion&#xD;
and guide of his ocean life, the gallant Admiral of the Aus-&#xD;
trian fleet, should be taken away.&#xD;
It was a, solemn moment, when the Commissioners entered,&#xD;
and the Archduke looked for the first time into the faces of the&#xD;
men who had such' confidence in one they had-never seen be-&#xD;
fore; and the impressiveness of the occasion was heightened,&#xD;

&#xD;
when Senor Gutierrez Estrada,* who was the chief of the. Com-&#xD;
missionejs, began to set forth, in a beautiful address, the urgent&#xD;
reasons fdr the Archduke's acceptance of the offered crown.&#xD;
" We, Prince, who are but feeble interpreters of that general&#xD;
applause of love, of the hopes and prayers of a whole nation,&#xD;
come to present, in the nation's name, to your Imperial High.&#xD;
ness, the crown of the Mexican empire, which the people offer&#xD;
you, Prince, freely and spontaneously, by a solemn decree of&#xD;
the notables,;already ratified by many provinces, and which soon&#xD;
will be, as every one says, by the entire nation.&#xD;
" The crown is very heavy which our admiration and love offer&#xD;
you to-day; but the day will come, we hope, when its possession&#xD;
will be enviable (thanks to your efforts, which Heaven will&#xD;
know how to recompense!) with our co-operation and unaltera-&#xD;
ble gratitude and loyalty."  . . . . .&#xD;
This was buta small portion of the expressions of love, sym-&#xD;
pathy, and encouragement which the Commissioners bore from.&#xD;
the Mexican people to the man they would call their ruler.&#xD;
Though gratified and pleased, as he could not fail to be, by these&#xD;
testimonials, Maximilian had chosen Truth and Justice as his.&#xD;
guides ; and therefore was not led to hasty conclusions, or into&#xD;
rash, impetuous promises. Neither flattery nor self-love could&#xD;
dethrone judgment, however cunning the plots they laid.&#xD;
The Archduke understood what it was to be called the choice&#xD;
of a party; and as such he did not desire to, go to Mexico. He&#xD;
must go there, not at the bidding alone of those now in power,&#xD;
but he must know that the general voice of the people called&#xD;
him.   Better far to remain forever in quiet retirement, than&#xD;
reign an unloved ruler.&#xD;
" It was not enough," said he to the Commissioners, after&#xD;
thanking them for the high compliments they had paid to him,&#xD;
"it was not enough to say that 'every province in Mexico will&#xD;
desire that he should rule over them;' it must be known that-,&#xD;
they do desire it; he must hear the voice of the whole nation,&#xD;
offering it, before he could accept the crown.&#xD;
"If this came to him freely and unreservedly expressed then,&#xD;
would he go to Mexico; and, confiding in the support of the Al-&#xD;
mighty, would devote his life to her regeneration; but'he could&#xD;
* It will be remembered that sefior Estrada, the speaker here, was the fearless and pub-&#xD;
lia-spirited patriot, who, in 1840, when Mexico was undergoing revolution, issued a pam-&#xD;
phlet urging constitutional monarch, with a foreign, Prince at its head, as the only rem-&#xD;
edy for the dire evils that afflicted the country. He has borne always with the true men&#xD;
o hi cqnr"r heeputaion* ofben a dgvoted iatriot, winling to sacriace every per-.&#xD;
&#xD;
not go there without pledges of good faith from the people ; with-&#xD;
out some stable guarantee that they would aid and assist him;&#xD;
and by forgetting all past differences and quarrels, and uniting&#xD;
in a general pacification, give their country the eminent place&#xD;
which appears to be destined for her among nations, under a&#xD;
government which has for its principles ; 'Equity and Justice."'&#xD;
Such was the answer of the Archduke to the Commissioners.&#xD;
And they took their departure from Miramar, assuring His&#xD;
Highness that ere long a second call from Mexico, bearing the&#xD;
same import, would again be heard ; for the Mexican people were&#xD;
convinced that their only hope of safety lay in the presence of&#xD;
a great and august Prince.&#xD;
&#xD;
.         .&#xD;
&#xD;
The months passed on, and it was understood that the vote&#xD;
had been taken in Mexico; and now the people called for the&#xD;
Archduke Maximilian again. The Commissioners would, in&#xD;
the early spring, wait upon His Highness, to offer him again&#xD;
the crown; and April was the month appointed for their second&#xD;
visit to Miramar.&#xD;
It was necessary that the Archduke and his young consort&#xD;
should go to France, to England, to Belgium, and Vienna, be-&#xD;
fore their final decision was made ; and so, early in March they&#xD;
left their own home, and were soon in the gay capital of the&#xD;
world.  In Paris, they were received as royal guests by&#xD;
their Majesties, the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress Euge-&#xD;
me, and were entertained with the greatest cordiality and cour-&#xD;
tesy.&#xD;
Their visit was limited necessarily to a few days. Though'it&#xD;
had not been openly announced that the Archduke would ac-&#xD;
cept the crown, ye it was well understood in diplomatic circles.&#xD;
During Maximilia's stay in Paris, there were weighty matters&#xD;
of state to be arranged between himself and the Emperor of&#xD;
France, who had contributed so materially towards advancing&#xD;
him to this Western throne.&#xD;
The Emperor guaranteed the support of the French troops,&#xD;
to the future empire of Mexico for a pei-iod- of six years&#xD;
or until it should become firmly established, and could rely upon&#xD;
its own strength ; there, was also financial assistance promised;&#xD;
and the agreement known as the "Treaty of Miramar " was&#xD;
drawn up'; though the signatures were left to be added after the&#xD;
final acceptance of the crown.&#xD;

self a devotee to the fine arts, insisted that one morning should&#xD;
be passed in the Louvre, among the monuments of the immor-&#xD;
tal men of genius.&#xD;
As the royal party, the Emperor Napoleon and the Em-&#xD;
press, the Archduke and Archduchess, walked through the&#xD;
long galleries, and stopped from time to time before some crea-&#xD;
tion of iubens, Rembrandt, or Salvator Rosa; or. paused&#xD;
before th French Raphael, Lesueur, so like, and yet so unlike&#xD;
the Itali n artist - a painter of pure sentiment ; or perhaps,&#xD;
awe-stric en, stood before the tangible dream of the thought-&#xD;
painter, oussin, who glorified himself in his grand conception&#xD;
and mas erly execution of the "-Deluge," where the beholder&#xD;
sees port ayed the horrors of that fearful time, when the moon,&#xD;
floating  through darkling clouds, frowned upon the earth,&#xD;
"that w s being swallowed up in water ; dead bodies drifting&#xD;
here and there, and the last mother yearningly extending her&#xD;
last child~ to the last father, that cannot even save himself;"&#xD;
as 'they t ok in these sublime pictures one after another, and&#xD;
thea turned to the breathing landscapes, the beautiful soli-&#xD;
tudes and luminous horizons of Claude Lorraine who hangs&#xD;
about his scenes an atmosphere that is a halo of glory,-the&#xD;
delight .cf the Archduchess knew no bounds. Her own soul&#xD;
was drawn out; and as from time to time they passed young&#xD;
artists, ho were here and there making copies, and pursuing&#xD;
their studies before some masterpiece, she had for each, a word&#xD;
of encouagement and a gracious smile of sympathy,&#xD;
At last, in an open part of the gallery, where the light from&#xD;
above fel 'full upon it, they came upon a grand, majestic por-&#xD;
trait of "Napoleonthe First," painted by the artist, David. The&#xD;
haughty ip of the hero was curled by a proud smile ; and the&#xD;
eye .seemed almost to burn out of the canvass, and flash as of&#xD;
old with its martial fire. The beholders felt it in their hearts&#xD;
to do homage ; 'and wondered. not that it took but a word, a&#xD;
look, from this man to subdue even the lion-hearted Ney&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
As they turned from the picture, which they gazed on in&#xD;
silence, the Archduchess Carlotta, accepting the offered arm of&#xD;
the Emperor, whispered softly;,&#xD;
"Let us go where his ashes rest!"&#xD;
They left the gallery of 'the Louvre, and entering the royal&#xD;
coach, were soon at the Hotel des Invalides, and entering,&#xD;
proceeded at once to the "Tomb of Napoleon."  Immediately&#xD;
under th~ great dome of the chapel is the crypt containing the&#xD;
&#xD;
sarcophagus, in which rests the mortal remains of the great con-&#xD;
queror. Around are the banners taken in battle from the&#xD;
enemy.&#xD;
And this, was all of the man who had made the world&#xD;
tremble! -Enveloped in gloom; broodeLover by a spirit of&#xD;
silence, which is only disturbed by the voices of those who&#xD;
come to visit him in death, this handful of ashes is all that is&#xD;
.left of the mighty Napoleon !&#xD;
He sleeps&#xD;
"where nothing breathes, save the insatiate worm;&#xD;
And nothing is, but the drear, altering corse ;&#xD;
Resolving, silently, to shapeless dust,&#xD;
In unpierced darkness, and in black oblivion."&#xD;
"But he has left a name," said the Archduke, as the&#xD;
thought ran through the mind of each; "a name, laurel-&#xD;
wreathed, to posterity!"&#xD;
"Requiescat in pace!" said the Archduchess sadly, as&#xD;
they turned to go.&#xD;
Aye," said the Emperor. "Requiescat in pace /   Though&#xD;
there be some who bay at the tomb of Greatness, yet their&#xD;
howling does not vex the immortal spirit; that is gone to&#xD;
eternity; and there is no hand that can pluck a leaf from his&#xD;
chaplet! There are some born," continued the Emperor, as they&#xD;
were again seated in the coach, and driving towards the Tuil-&#xD;
eries, "who occupy the place midway between, and form    a&#xD;
link connecting gods and men. The , ancients, and Pindar,&#xD;
their great lyric poet, called them heroes; and extolled their&#xD;
deeds whileJiving, and in death made their tombs t)e Mecca&#xD;
of many pilgrimages; but in this century, when such men&#xD;
come and startle the world with the accomplishment of Her-&#xD;
culean deeds, it is the cry,,'not to admire, but to pull them&#xD;
down to the common level.' We have a right to speak truth&#xD;
of the- dead; and we owe it to them  not to' be silent. Cer-.&#xD;
tainly, the memory of my uncle has borne itself up against&#xD;
thole who would 'stab him in death ; and their weapons, how-&#xD;
ever pointed, are powerless to injure one. whom Fame has&#xD;
chosen for immortality!"&#xD;
They reached the palace, and retired until later; when, after&#xD;
a drive in the Bois de Boulogne, where the gay, gladsome ,1ite)&#xD;
of Paris are seen in all the grandeur of magnificent equipages.&#xD;
and splendid toilettes, the Archduke and Archduchess were to&#xD;
accompany their Majesties to the Grand Opera. The perform-&#xD;

ances of the evening were, of course, to be unusually fine, in&#xD;
honor of the royal presence.&#xD;
Evening came; and there was gathered in the opera house&#xD;
a brilliant audience, full of life and vivacity.  Many of&#xD;
the elegant private boxes were filled with the families of the&#xD;
nobility, and gave forth one blaze of light, flashing from- gems&#xD;
and jewels.&#xD;
As the royal party were seen entering the private box near&#xD;
the stage, the cry arose, Vive L'Empereur ! .Vive L'Im-&#xD;
peratrice !"&#xD;
The Archduchess, eager to catch a glance of. the-brilliant&#xD;
spectacle of a French audience in full dress, pushed back the&#xD;
magnificently embroidered curtain that shut her in. As she did&#xD;
so, and those without caught sight of her beautiful face, upon&#xD;
the impulse of the moment there came the shout; "Vive L'Jm-&#xD;
peratrice de Mexico ! Vive L'Empereur de Mexico!" and at&#xD;
the same moment the orchestra began the soul-stirring air,&#xD;
" God save the Queen! " while on the stage the handsome drop-&#xD;
curtain, slowly rising, presented the first scene in the Opera of&#xD;
" Lucia di Lammermoor.&#xD;
The play went on to the end; the crowd dispersed; the'&#xD;
opera house was deserted 'by all, save those who lingered -to&#xD;
put out the lights; and through the streets, homeward bound,&#xD;
the equipages of the nobility hurried to and fro.&#xD;
As they drove on, the Archduchess Carlotta expressed her&#xD;
delight at the entertainment of the evening, and above all, the&#xD;
splendid acting of the. artists, who did credit to the French&#xD;
stage.&#xD;
"Ah !" said the .Empress Eugenie, "you should have seen&#xD;
Rachel in her prime;---our own Rachel! She was in truth born&#xD;
for her vocation, for her dramatic talent had its home in her&#xD;
heart ; it was natural, not acquired. She felt all that she por-&#xD;
trayed ! With her, it was not acting, but reality ; she idealized&#xD;
herself for the time into the character she represented; and&#xD;
therein lay her power ; for without that enthusiasm inmthe&#xD;
actor, thre can be none excited in the beholder."&#xD;
" I remember to have seen Rachel once, years ago;" said&#xD;
the Emnperor, when the Empress had finished speaking, and I&#xD;
shall never forget her acting upon that occasion. It was in&#xD;
her paly days, when all Paris adored her, and was at her&#xD;
feet. The play, I forget its name, turned upon the faithless-&#xD;
iaess of a lover on whom the heart and soul of the heroine was&#xD;
centred.- Repeatedly was she warned of his falseness; but&#xD;
&#xD;
with all the beautiful and heavenly trust of woman, she scorned&#xD;
to doubt the idol of her heart; she knew him to be true. In&#xD;
the last scene after having conveyed to the audience the out-.&#xD;
pourings of her heart for him, the beauty and tenderness, her&#xD;
trust in and love for him;- she is given, by one who knows of his&#xD;
treachery and guilt, convincing proof of his unworthiness.&#xD;
Even she, who had clung to him, &amp;amp;nd upheld him in the face&#xD;
of the *world can now no longer doubt, for there is no shadow of&#xD;
hope left to her ! Turning aside from those who stand there&#xD;
witnesses of her agony, -seemingly grief-stricken, - she first&#xD;
mutely lifts her hands to heaven; and then, letting them fall&#xD;
powerless at her side, a cold, stony look crept into her face,&#xD;
and she exclaimed in tones that, sent \ a thrill of -sympathetic&#xD;
anguish through the heart of each listener:&#xD;
"'Enfin, i m'a troops ! At last, he has deceived me !' That&#xD;
was all;" yet in the simple gesture, the voice, and the expres-&#xD;
sion, there was a concentration of agony, of despair over be-&#xD;
trayed faith and trust, that amounted to sublimity ! Your&#xD;
Highness has surely seen Rachel?"&#xD;
"No ;" replied.the Archduke. "I was so unfortunate as to&#xD;
miss the ,Queen of Tragedy; and only console myself for the&#xD;
loss in having seen the magnificent Ristori, who, I believe, was&#xD;
at one time a rival of Rachel's. I saw her at Rome, where I&#xD;
believe she was educated, and where she made her dsbtU in the&#xD;
grand role of Marie Stuart."&#xD;
" Ah, yes ! " said the Empress. "She played in that, here&#xD;
in Paris, some years since. It was, of course, after she became&#xD;
Marquise di Capranica; and though her words were unintel-&#xD;
ligible to half the audience, yet her actions were so, full of pas-&#xD;
sion and fire, that the enthusiasm of our excitable Parisians&#xD;
amounted almost to frenzy. A little anecdote is told of Rachel,&#xD;
in connection with Ristori. It-was said of her, that after the&#xD;
Italian artist's appearance in Paris, that one night returning from&#xD;
the theatre, where Ristori had set the audience almost wild&#xD;
with delight and admirationRachel rghed to her own apart-&#xD;
inent, exclaiming; ' I must show these French people that .Ra&#xD;
chel still lives!' ' And she immediately went on the stage&#xD;
again; from which she had temporarily retired."&#xD;
&#xD;
-        -        -       -&#xD;
&#xD;
-,       S         -&#xD;
&#xD;
And so passed the few days of business and pleasure in&#xD;
Paris ; and the royal couple bade adieu to the Emperor of&#xD;
France, with every confidence in him for the future, and left&#xD;

the capital. He had guaranteed to the Archduke substantial&#xD;
assistance, and encouragement to the Empire of Mexico; and in&#xD;
return the claims of France were to be settled by separate in-&#xD;
stallments as the Government was able to meet them.&#xD;
From Paris, the Archduke and Archduchess proceeded: to&#xD;
England    firm, substantial England ! One feels the. change&#xD;
almost in the tread of the soil, in going from France, where all&#xD;
is revolution and uncertainty restrained, to the solid, time-test-&#xD;
ed govern ent of the Albion isle. Here, in - London, their&#xD;
royal cous   the gracious Queen Victoria, accorded to her&#xD;
relatives the warmest welcome ,at Windsor Castle; and the&#xD;
pleasure o their visit was much enhanced by the presence of&#xD;
King Leo old of Belgium, the Archduchess's father, who had&#xD;
come hither to meet them.&#xD;
But tim  pressed; and farewells must be hastened, for there&#xD;
was still the visit to Vienna to be made, and the tenth of April&#xD;
was near at hand; so, with the heartfelt blessing, the good coun-&#xD;
sel and sage advice of the father whom she was never more to&#xD;
see in life, the Archduchess left London with her husband, and&#xD;
soon they were in Vienna, where the family compact was to be&#xD;
entered into by the members of the Austrian House, in view of&#xD;
the Archduke's acceptance of the crown of Mexico.&#xD;
As the period of their stay was to be so short, and the greater&#xD;
portion devoted to business, Maximilian desired there should be&#xD;
no outward demonstrations;- and as he had not as yet publicly&#xD;
accepted the future crown, all farewell festivities were of course&#xD;
precluded ; and after all, this visit to his boyhood's home and&#xD;
to his family, the last perhaps he should ever make them, had&#xD;
in it more of sadness than of pleasure.&#xD;
There was Schnbrunn, his birth-place; and the Imperial&#xD;
palace in the city; the home of his ancestors for so many years;&#xD;
nd there, his mother, the Archduchess Sophie; who had ten-&#xD;
erly loved him from  his youth, and who had looked with&#xD;
pride upon her noble son as he grew up to be the gallant Ad-&#xD;
miral; there was his father; the brothers, - to all of whom he&#xD;
was united by the dearest ties; to these, dear as. they were he&#xD;
must say Adieu; and, in looking thus over 'the past, over what&#xD;
was to be left behind, and then into the future, that sometimes&#xD;
seemed dima with clouds, there was not all gladness in his heart,&#xD;
for he knew not, 'but only trusted, that success awaited him.&#xD;
Oh ! that some voice had whispered then, "Le 'eu n'en vaut&#xD;
pas ica chandetle!"&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
T is the early spring-time; -the season when   the&#xD;
golden crocuses and modest forget-me-nots lift their&#xD;
tiny heads above the grassy turf; and the blue-eyed&#xD;
violets, hiding in woodland shades, peer through the&#xD;
young leaflets and swelling buds, to catch a glimpse of the&#xD;
warming April sky.&#xD;
The Prater, the fashionable park of Vienna, is again&#xD;
thronged with the elite of the Imperial city. The winter&#xD;
winds, blowing cold and unfriendly over he Danube, had&#xD;
caused the beautiful island resort to be well nigh deserted dur-&#xD;
ing the chilly months that have passed. Right cheerless, and&#xD;
dreary were the fountains, whose softly murmured words had&#xD;
frozen into diamond crystals on their marble lips ; and bleak&#xD;
and desolate seemed the leafless trees of:- the forest, whose&#xD;
silence was unbroken, save by the crackling of the sear and dried&#xD;
grass beneath the tread of the tame deer,: that roam the shaded&#xD;
dells of the vast enclosure.&#xD;
But now the spring-time is here ! The- spirit of 'Ethereal&#xD;
Mildness' has waved her magic wand over the scene, andi all is&#xD;
changed ; the lips of the fountains are unsealed and again their&#xD;
soft voices are heard, chanting love-songs to, the growing flow-&#xD;
ers. The winding walks are thronged with pedestrians; and&#xD;
beneath the spreading branches of the immense trees are seat-&#xD;
ed groups of 'lighted-hearted citizens, engaged in lively dis-&#xD;
course ; while, through the main -avenues roll hundreds of&#xD;
handsome equipages, mounted by liveried 'coachmen, and drawn&#xD;
by stately horses that dance proudly beneath their gilded trap.&#xD;
pings.&#xD;
Occasionally a party on horseback dashes by, affording theme&#xD;
for comment and gossip to the slow-moving pedestrians that&#xD;
follow, and the idle chatting groups that linger beneath the&#xD;
trees.&#xD;
"Ah ! there goes the youngCount Stahremberg! What a&#xD;
dashing, handsome fellow he is! exclaimedmd one. "I wonder'if&#xD;
it is true that he is going to marry the Russian Minister's&#xD;
daughter?&#xD;

hold of anyhing Russian ! I cannot, connect the idea of love,&#xD;
somehow, with the people, since I have read of that barbarous&#xD;
Catharine! Ugh ! when you mention her name, I seem to hear&#xD;
the hiss of the knout."&#xD;
" Bah!   other," exclaimed a bright-eyed maiden of not more&#xD;
than seventeen at her side. "A truce to your horrible allu-&#xD;
sions of wh at happened long ago ! Russia is quite civilized&#xD;
now!"&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Giselle thinks maidens are entitled to be&#xD;
loved everyhere;" said her companion softly, a handsome&#xD;
young German, who evidently regarded her with loving admi-&#xD;
ration.                  I&#xD;
" See ! "  terrupted Giselle quickly, " there they come !&#xD;
How beautfu1 the Archduchess Carlotta looks in her riding&#xD;
habit, and isa't the Archduke splendid?  I knew they'd be in&#xD;
the Prater this afternoon; and there are the young Dukes, Carl&#xD;
and Victor ! Don't they look handsome ?"&#xD;
And intr th, it was a gladsome sight. The Archduke Max-&#xD;
imilian cam  first, in full Austrian uniform; his proud, noble&#xD;
face lit up  th a smile as he graciously returned the saluta-&#xD;
tions of thos he passed. By his'side, rode the Archduchess in&#xD;
a dark cloth habit, that showed to advantage her finely rounded&#xD;
figure, and t e long plume drooping. from the jaunty hat fur-&#xD;
n'shed a sombre background for the lovely face,&#xD;
Behind them, came the Archduke's young brothers, Charles&#xD;
Louis and Louis Victor, two handsome young princes, of whom&#xD;
Austria has  right to be proud..&#xD;
They passed quickly on; exchanging now and then piquant&#xD;
sallies with each other, and the members of the nobility they&#xD;
met, and returning the salutations of those among the humbler&#xD;
classes, who rled out to them, " Long life!"&#xD;
They swep around a sudden curve in the avenue, and, as the&#xD;
long skirt of he Archduchess floated out gracefully in the wind,&#xD;
many an anous, envying glance followed the party till they&#xD;
w ro lost in he distance.&#xD;
Ie A    claimed the coquettish little maidei that had her-&#xD;
al l1ed their approach, --with something of discontent and impa-&#xD;
tience in her voice, "why are some blessed, so much more&#xD;
than others ?.There is the Archduke, who,, they say, is going&#xD;
to be a great King; and the Archduchess will be such a beauti-&#xD;
ful Queen ! Why was not I born at least a Princess, instead&#xD;
of a poor shop girl ?"  -.                     &#xD;

"Giselle, again murmuring?" said her young lover, as they&#xD;
two wandered away from the path.. "What idle words ! why&#xD;
can you not be, content with being happy as you are ? were you&#xD;
a Princess, then would I despair; for I would dare not love&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"Ah.! Carl, you see you have no ambition! But then you'd&#xD;
have no trouble in finding another maiden that, would suit you&#xD;
quite as well as I do ! And I? I would have a prince, .a&#xD;
grand prince, in uniform, like the Archduke Maximilian, for a&#xD;
lover, and I'd wear silks and satins all the day long, and such&#xD;
a coachman and' horses as I would have!"  How small the&#xD;
poor artist lover, with his plain black coat, and his pale, hand-&#xD;
some face, looked at that moment in the, eyes of the dreaming&#xD;
' "Poor Cinderella ! " said Carl sadly, " poor Cinderella ! And&#xD;
do you think all these would make you happy? How many&#xD;
of these noble lords do you suppose, Giselle, love their wives,&#xD;
and are truly contented?"&#xD;
." Love their wives ?  And what if they don't ?  Do their&#xD;
wives care ? Isn't it enough for them to be such grand ladies,&#xD;
and to be so rich, and give such lovely balls and. fetes ? If I&#xD;
am a Cinderella, I wish the kind god-mother would send ine to&#xD;
just one of these great entertainments; for, if I only had the&#xD;
power, in a twinkle what a beautiful Princess I would be, and&#xD;
you, Carl, should be the Prince, my lover ! "  And Giselle&#xD;
pouted out her pretty lips as she added, " But it's no use&#xD;
wishing; we have got to be.just what we are, all our days!"&#xD;
" Ah, Giselle ! " said the young man, as a shadow rested on&#xD;
his brow. "I can never make you happy; for if you loved me&#xD;
as truly as you say, you would leave off saying so many things&#xD;
to wound me ;." and unable to hide his grief, he turned away&#xD;
and left her.&#xD;
,Giselle stood and watched him. At first the love in her heat&#xD;
for she did truly love him-bade her call after him. "'Carl,&#xD;
Carl !  she lalf-way uttered, but Pride whispered -pride, her&#xD;
besetting sin  " Never mind; he'll come back again ! ".. And so&#xD;
she, too, turned off, and went to seek her parents, who still sat&#xD;
not far distant.&#xD;
.Poor Giselle ! she carried home a double weight of care from&#xD;
the Prater; a longing for what could not be; and the knowledge&#xD;
that she had offended, as she too often did,:the true - hearted'&#xD;
lover, who, before the spring-time deepened into summer, would&#xD;
claim her as his own.&#xD;

CROWN JEWELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
While on the Prater hundreds were enjoying the delights of&#xD;
out-door life, and the blessing of the pure air of heaven, in the&#xD;
city the streets are thronged with passers. Perhaps in no place&#xD;
of the Old World, can there be found, a more diverse gathering&#xD;
of the representatives of all nations than at Vienna. It is truly&#xD;
" the connecting link between the barbaric splendor of the East,&#xD;
and the civilization of Europe. Persians, Turks, Chinese,&#xD;
Gr eks, and Germans meet there in one grand Exchange."&#xD;
t is just the hour of the evening when everything wears a&#xD;
bu y look - when business men are hurrying homeward, and&#xD;
those who are seeking the dissipated enjoyments of the night are&#xD;
tur ing out.,&#xD;
s the twilight closed in without, the caf6-room of the Cas-&#xD;
ind the favorite resort of the nobility, was rapidly filling.&#xD;
Ar und the little tables were groups of gentlemen sipping their&#xD;
coffee, their melange, or taking their ices ; at a private corner&#xD;
ma be seen a crusty old bachelor, who prefers taking his ice&#xD;
and coffee aloe, stopping, now and then, to read the evening&#xD;
dispatches in the paper, that lays open before him. Others,&#xD;
w'h their boon companions, having finished both sipping and&#xD;
reading, have fallen back in their seats, and with feet ele-&#xD;
vated on the sides of a neighbor's chair, have given them-&#xD;
selves to the comfort of a German's best friend, "mein pipe,"&#xD;
and whiff and puff away, calling up a dreamland or cloud-&#xD;
land of smok '; without mercy to those who have not pro-&#xD;
gressed so far in the evening programme ; and who, many of&#xD;
them, hasten their indulgence of wine, to, leave the cloudy&#xD;
atmosphere for a quiet game at billiards in the apartment ad-&#xD;
joining, from whence, through the open door, can be heard&#xD;
the clacking of the balls as in rolling over the green baize&#xD;
they strike each other.&#xD;
At a table on the. left of the entrance ; occupying a recess&#xD;
of the side window, and therefore somewhat removed from tie&#xD;
buzz and hum around, sit two young noblemen, who are em-&#xD;
ployed, like the others, in lending their voices -but in more sub-&#xD;
clued tones -to heighten the general murmur of conversation.&#xD;
"1Well !" said a tall, handsome man of three or four and&#xD;
twenty, as he enters and approaches the two, "Isolani and&#xD;
Khevenhiller,! -both here? We are well met ! I am astounded&#xD;
at meeting you, of all men, Isolani ! Here I have been pour-&#xD;

And you, Khevenhnller, how did you leave the'good people in&#xD;
Bohemia?"&#xD;
"One, question at a time, Stahremberg," replied the young&#xD;
man last named, as the new-comer seated himself; and gave&#xD;
his order for wine and ice.  "I have been in Vienna for two&#xD;
days past; and this evening stumbled upon Isolani, who tells&#xD;
me he is just up from Trieste. - And now, tell us something of&#xD;
yourself, my good Count; how goes-the world with you?"&#xD;
"Ah, just so-so; the same old occupation, dolee farniente,' "&#xD;
replied the young man shrugging his shoulders; "and tiresome&#xD;
business it is, too.. I have just come from a race in the Prater,&#xD;
where I met his Highness, the Archduke Maximilian. I sup-&#xD;
pose this is his last visit to Viennaand he is really off to Mex-&#xD;
ico. Give us the truth of -it, Isolani; for I suppose you still&#xD;
cast your fortunes with the Archduke."&#xD;
" Yes," said Count Isolani, "I shall perhaps go with the&#xD;
Archduke to Mexico; there is nothing to hold me here."&#xD;
" Then you are really going to resign your position in the&#xD;
navy, and try your luck in the New World? My ! but I al-&#xD;
most ,wish I was going with you! What a chance for adven-&#xD;
ture ! I say, Khevenhiiller, sha'nt we give Isolani our hand to-&#xD;

troops that are to go over, they say, next autumn? I'm tired&#xD;
of being a waif, floating about on the Continent, no use to my-&#xD;
self, nor to any one else; and change,- a complete change,&#xD;
would be a great relief. If there's fighting in this Mexican&#xD;
programme, why, I had rather fight for the Archduke Maxim-&#xD;
ilian, God bless him! than any man living,-saving, and except-&#xD;
ing my honored self."&#xD;
" Are you really Jin earnest, Stahremberg? " said Count&#xD;
Khevenhuller, laughing. "You are such a wild fellow, that&#xD;
you may be in New Zealand before autumn. But you have&#xD;
quite struck upon my plan, which is, to get up a regiment of&#xD;
Hussars, to go over to Mexico in October."&#xD;
"Ahem ! " said the Count with dignity; "Colonel Kheven.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE Archduke Maximilian had requested an audience&#xD;
with the members of his family, to perfect the riin-&#xD;
quishment of his right to the Austrian accession; and&#xD;
to surrender his claim to any portion of the family&#xD;
estate.&#xD;
The hour for the audience had arrived ; and when Maximilian&#xD;
entered his brother's private cabinet, he found there, awaiting&#xD;
him, not only the Emperor, but the Archduke Charles, his&#xD;
father ; the Archduchess Sophie, his mother ; his younger broth-&#xD;
ers, and. Count Rechberg, the Archduke Wilhelm, and Arch-&#xD;
duke Leopold; all Ministers of State.&#xD;
The Emperor Franz Joseph and his father sat near the ta-&#xD;
ble, looking, over, with Count Rechberg, a pile of documents&#xD;
that lay thereon. The younger brothers, with the Archdukes,&#xD;
their cousins, stood near the window, looking upon the scene&#xD;
without ; while the mother sat apart from the others, in a&#xD;
large arm-chair, and with her head leaning upon her hand,&#xD;
seemed lost in thought.&#xD;
When -Maximilian entered, they all turned towards him. He&#xD;
simply greeted them, and drawing a chair near to his mother,&#xD;
seated himself beside her, and waited for his brother, the Emi&#xD;
peror, to bring forward the business, for the consideration of&#xD;
which they .were assembled.        .-&#xD;
At last the Emperor pushed aside the papers, and claimed&#xD;
the attention of the Ministers.&#xD;
"We are here, gentlemen," said. he, "by request of the&#xD;
Archduke Maximilian. You are doubtless aware that in a few&#xD;
days he will formally accept from the hands of a deputation, al-&#xD;
ready arrived in Europe, the crown which Mexico has a sec-&#xD;
ond time offered to him. In accepting this foreign crown he re-&#xD;
linquishes his claims to the throne of Austria; andalso his share"&#xD;

&#xD;
We have here the terms of relinquishment: Duke Wilhelm,&#xD;
will you dous. the favor to read this paper aloud?"&#xD;
Duke Wilhelm stepped forward, and taking the roll of parch-&#xD;
ment which the Emperor held out, after first glancing over its&#xD;
contents, he read aloud the Prince's unconditional surrender of&#xD;
his rights and privileges in Austria, as an Austrian Prince.&#xD;
As the Minister finished the reading, and folding the docu.&#xD;
ment laid it again upon the table in front of the Emperor, a&#xD;
look of sadness might have been seen 'pon. the brow of the&#xD;
father ; and there was a feeling silence, which was at last bro-&#xD;
ken by the voice of the Count Rechberg, who, rising, turned&#xD;
himself towards the Archduke.&#xD;
" Though it may be ill-timed," he began, "we cannot see&#xD;
the final step taken in a matter of so much importance silently.&#xD;
Doubtless, every consideration for, and against our young&#xD;
Prince's acceptance of this crown have been duly weighed.&#xD;
Doubtless it is right that he should go to Mexico; doubtless he&#xD;
will build up a great nation there. But we must say, that our&#xD;
heart trembles when we think that for so long a time our&#xD;
young Prince must trust to France! Truly she is a powerful&#xD;
ally, but unfortunately not always a-trusty one. France knows&#xD;
that at present it is to her interest to build up Mexico; but if it&#xD;
should turn, France will not hesitate to break any promise ! "&#xD;
" You forget, Count Rechberg," said the Emperor, "that&#xD;
Austria and Belgium, too, have promised troops to the Empire of&#xD;
Mexico; and should an emergency arise, Austria would not de-&#xD;
sert her own! "&#xD;
" Gentlemen," said the Archduke Maximilian, rising, " I can-&#xD;
not but feel that these fears for the future are groundless ! As&#xD;
for placing faith in the Emperor of France, I have no fear that he.&#xD;
will break his promises or ignore his pledges. I believe him to be&#xD;
an honorable man. It is too late now,- though I thank Count&#xD;
Rechberg, with my whole heart, for his kind interest,- but it is&#xD;
too late to- discuss these questions. My decision is made, and&#xD;
there is but one thing, but one consideration, now that could&#xD;
change it. Should anything occur to convince me that I had been&#xD;
deceived ; that Mexico was falsely represented; that she does&#xD;
not, and did not desire that I should be her ruler -there is no&#xD;
power great enough ; no consideration sufficiently heavy, to in-&#xD;
duce me to accept the position of her Emperor. The difficulties&#xD;
and obstacles that lie before me I do not fear ; for courage and&#xD;
labor will overcome everything. If death should come to me&#xD;
earlier there than here, it would only be the matter of a few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
But to place myself in the position of a royal adventurer, ambi-&#xD;
tious of power, usurping the rights of a people -never! never !&#xD;
This, gentlemen, is the stone you can throw in my way; and if&#xD;
you cannot do that, the question is at rest."&#xD;
Maximilian had spoken with much earnestness and feeling;&#xD;
and as he took his seat,'not only the loving mother, but the&#xD;
Ministers, the father, the brother Emperor himself, looked at&#xD;
him glances akin to admiration.&#xD;
" The Archduke, my brother, has spoken nobly," said Fran-&#xD;
cis Joseph; "and since we hav heard his sentiments so fully&#xD;
expressed, we can but speed hiw on lis way ; for we know of&#xD;
no principle of national or individual liberty that he violates.&#xD;
His action m accepting the throne of Mexico after her second&#xD;
petition, will be always considered as right in the eyes of -the&#xD;
world.&#xD;
"May I be permitted, just here, to read aloud this letter?"&#xD;
said Maximilian, taking from his pocket a :letter bearing a for-&#xD;
eign postmark.. " It came to me a few weeks since, from Gen-&#xD;
eral Santa Anna, a man who, in days past, has figured much in&#xD;
Mexican history. It 'is from the class he represents, the Revo-&#xD;
lutionists, that I should fear most trouble; and though Santa&#xD;
Anna is now in exile, yet, as he has adherents in Mexico, his&#xD;
sentiments towards us are worthy of regard."&#xD;
Maximilian opened the letter, and began to read:&#xD;
"ST. TroMAs, December, 1863.&#xD;
"-To His Imperial and Boyal Highness, Archduke Ferdinand&#xD;
Maximilian of Austria.&#xD;
" SIRE:&#xD;
"When I heard that a considerable number of my fellow-&#xD;
countrymen, actuated by the purest patriotism, had fixed upon&#xD;
your Royal Highness to be called to the throne of Mexico; my&#xD;
soul overflowed with pleasure. If it had been in my power to&#xD;
accompany the Mexican deputation, your Imperial Highness&#xD;
would have heard from the mouth of one of the noblemen of&#xD;
independence, from one, who held for many years the first place&#xD;
among his fellow-citizens, the ratification, of what the worthy&#xD;
President of the Commission expressed with so much eloquence&#xD;
and sincerity.&#xD;
" Yes, Sire, in having the honor to greet your Imperial High-&#xD;

from my present place of residence, hoping that your Imperial&#xD;
Highness will receive the expression of my sentiments with&#xD;
your accustomed benevolence.&#xD;
"I may also assure your Imperial Highness, that the voice raised&#xD;
in Mexico to proclaim your respected name, is not the voice of&#xD;
a party. An immense majority of the nation desire to restore&#xD;
the empire of the Montezumas, with your Imperial Highness&#xD;
at its head ; believing it to be the only remedy for existing ills,&#xD;
and the ultimate anchor of its hopes.&#xD;
'"Accept, then, in absolute confidence, the enthusiastic Mexican&#xD;
vote ; and come courageously to the Mexican shores, certain of&#xD;
receiving demonstrations of love and profound respect, believing&#xD;
at the same time that your agreeable presence will suffice to re-&#xD;
store harmony throughout the land.&#xD;
" The occasion is propitious; and your Imperial Highness can&#xD;
make the Mexicans happy, by placing your name among those&#xD;
of the heroes, blessed by posterity.&#xD;
"The vast, beautiful, and fertile soil of Mexico abounds in&#xD;
elements to form a first-class empire on the American conti-&#xD;
nent ; consequently, it is no insignificant power that is offered'&#xD;
to your Highness. True, the country has suffered from anarchy&#xD;
for half a century; but under the auspices of peace, with a pa-&#xD;
tient just, and enlightened government, its resources will be&#xD;
restored in a few years, and it will be the admiration of the&#xD;
whole world. Would to Heaven I could see this before I end&#xD;
my days ! I hope your Imperial Highness will acknowledge in&#xD;
the Dean of the Mexican country, a devoted and disinterested&#xD;
friend ; a very obedient servant, who wishes you the greatest&#xD;
happiness, and fervently kisses the hands of your Imperial&#xD;
Highness.,&#xD;
"ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA 'ANNA.', *&#xD;
"Very fair! very fair !" said Count Rechberg, with an in-&#xD;
credulous shake of his head. " I trust Antonio Santa Anna&#xD;
may be the true exponent of Mexico's wishes and desires; for,&#xD;
* This letter has been proven to have been written by Santa Anna, though, when the&#xD;
tide turned, he attempted to disclaim it. Had the Emperor Maximilian known him as&#xD;
Americans do, he perhaps would have mistrusted his disinterested friendship. As it was,&#xD;
the letter doubtless had its full weight.  -.&#xD;

my young Prince, she has never before been blessed by a ruler&#xD;

"It is exceedingly gratifying, my brother," said the Emperor,&#xD;
"as you have remarked, to receive these private expressions of&#xD;
the feeling with which your coming to Mexico is regarded. Still,&#xD;
we should lack of our duty, knowing state policy and human na-&#xD;
ture so well, if we failed to whisper to you, not to trust too much&#xD;
to these outward seedings and public .obeisance. But we talk&#xD;
to the Archduke," continued the Emperor, interrupting himself,&#xD;
and turning with a smile to Count Rechberg, " as if he were a&#xD;
beardless youth, about to begin his trial with the world. These&#xD;
sage bits of wisdom, and Tupper-like maxims, lie in the fare-&#xD;
wells of our august and tender parents,",with an inclinatih&#xD;
towards the Archduke Charles and the Archduchess. "Time&#xD;
will soon press us; and the business of the morning is hardly be-&#xD;
gun. Your decision is made, Maximilian ? "&#xD;
"It is;" returned Maximilian, coming forward. "I go to&#xD;
Mexico, unless :unforeseen circumstances arise to prevent. In a&#xD;
few days, the deputation will reach Miramar; and after thelast&#xD;
arrangements are made with them, there will be nothing to&#xD;
prevent the immediate departure of the Archduchess and my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"Let us understand each other, then," said the Emperor.&#xD;
"You may rely upon the first division of Austrian and Belgian&#xD;
troops early in the autumn."&#xD;
"Napoleon has arranged that theyshall come over in French&#xD;
transports," replied the Archduke. "I trust," he continued,&#xD;
"by the blessing of God upon the exertions I shall make, that&#xD;
there is indeed a brighter destiny for Mexico than has ever&#xD;
been prophesied; and I trust that not only France, but Aus-&#xD;
tria, too, may be repaid forty-fold for the assistance they lend&#xD;
her now."~&#xD;
"But understand, Maximilian," said the Emperor, "though&#xD;
you leave Austria, she does not give you up.&#xD;
"No, no ! " echoed the voices of all in an undertone.&#xD;
"And should you find your empire in Mexico unable to sus-&#xD;
tain itself," continued Francis Joseph, "remember you are still&#xD;
one of the House of Hapsburg. In order to provide for future&#xD;
uncertainties and contingencies, we have thought best to place&#xD;
in the instrument .a clause, which sets forth that should you&#xD;

prerogatives you now relinquish. Are you ready, gentlemen,"&#xD;
said he, turning to the Ministers, "togive us your signatures&#xD;
Those of the Archdukes will be given at Miramar, after the&#xD;
Archduke Maximilian has finally accepted the crown of Mex-&#xD;
ico."&#xD;
The Ministers came forward, and attached their names as&#xD;
witnesses of the compact between the members of the royal fam-&#xD;
ily and the Emperor-elect of Mexico, leaving the vacant places,&#xD;
for the signatures at Miramar.&#xD;
The Archduke Charles, the Archduchess Sophie, placed their&#xD;
names also; and then came that of Francis Joseph, Emperor&#xD;
of Austria.&#xD;
The business of the morning finished, the Emperor touched&#xD;
the bell that summoned the marshal in waiting, and the Minis-&#xD;
ters were shown out. Each one, as they left, silently extend-&#xD;
ed their hand to the Emperor-elect, for they felt now that he&#xD;
was almost gone from them.      -     -&#xD;
The door closed, and only the members of the family re-&#xD;
mained. State affairs had gone out, and family confidence and.&#xD;
family love had come in. A spirit of sadness,- that indefinable&#xD;
mist of tears that precedes all long partings, -had crept in too.&#xD;
The Emperor Francis Joseph turned from the door, and saw&#xD;
his father standing beside his brother Emperor, with his hand&#xD;
-     upon his shoulder. He stopped, and listened to the charge that&#xD;
he was giving.&#xD;
"My son," said the father, " you have made your choice, be&#xD;
it wise or not. Do your best; and may Heaven's blessing rest&#xD;
upon you ! You have been educated for a ruler, Maximilian ;&#xD;
and I can say but little that you have not heard before ; but I&#xD;
call up now the words of the poet-philosopher, and beg you&#xD;
"These few precepts in thy memory bear:&#xD;
Give thy thoughts no tongue,&#xD;
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.&#xD;
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,&#xD;
Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel.'&#xD;
I will only add: To thy God and thine own self, be true !"&#xD;
The father's voice was tremulous with feeling. Francis&#xD;
Joseph had come near them as he finished speaking, and now&#xD;
silently embraced his brother, and with a whispered "God&#xD;
bless you, Maximilian!" he took his father's arm, and the two&#xD;
together left the cabinet-chamber, and the Archduchess Sophie&#xD;
and her son were alone.&#xD;
The mother sat very still where she had taken her place, after&#xD;
&#xD;
signing, as she almost felt it to be, her son's death-warrant;&#xD;
for, in her woman's heart, she felt that Maximilian was dead&#xD;
to her. For to woman, what are honors, crowns, chaplets,&#xD;
and sceptres, if the dear ones are gone ?  What though the&#xD;
trumpet-blasts of fame proclaim the name of her child from&#xD;
land to land, if she cannot look upon his face: if she can never&#xD;
hear his voice ? A mother's love, though deep and true, cannot&#xD;
rid itself of all selfishness.&#xD;
The Archduchess, as she heard the father's parting, took in&#xD;
the whole truth; and pressing her hands over her face, she for-&#xD;
got all else, save this trial, and this son.  She thought of his&#xD;
infancy, his boyhood, his manhood, and as she remembered him,&#xD;
always tender, always dutiful and affectionate, he seemed to&#xD;
grow dearer to her heart.&#xD;
Maximilian stood for a moment, after his father and brother&#xD;
had left, and waited for the Archduchess to speak ; but as he&#xD;
looked, he saw the tears stealing through her fingers, and in&#xD;
his own heart, he felt all that overcame her.&#xD;
"Mother ! " he cried, starting forward and kneeling by her side,&#xD;
"mother, still the fears of your heart for my future ! You&#xD;
know that I will do right; and believe that all is for the best !&#xD;
Give me your blessing, my, mother; and your forgiveness for&#xD;
all that I have ever done to grieve you. Let me feel, that&#xD;
whatever may betide me in that new home across the ocean, I&#xD;
take with me your forgiveness, your love, your blessing."&#xD;
" Forgiveness? " said the Archduchess, bending down and&#xD;
pushing back the heavy hair, and kissing his brow. " Maxi-&#xD;
milian, from the time you first saw the light at Schnbrunn, you&#xD;
have been a blessing to me.  Never have you forgotten to do&#xD;
all in your power to make your mother happy ! Aye, my son;&#xD;
take with you my love, my prayers, my heart itself, and my&#xD;
blessing. Yes ; as Isaac of old blessed his son, so I bless&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
The Archduchess placed her hands upon the bowed head,&#xD;
and in a voice filled with tearful emotion, uttered her fare-&#xD;
well :&#xD;
"God give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the&#xD;
earth. Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee.&#xD;
Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be every&#xD;
one that blesseth thee ! "&#xD;

MAXIMILIAN, Emperor of Mexico, swear to God,&#xD;
by the Holy Evangelists, that I will try to promote,&#xD;
through all the means within. my power, the welfare and&#xD;
prosperity of the nation, to defend its independence,&#xD;
and to preserve the whole of its territory!"&#xD;
Deeply and solemnly the voice of the Archduke Maximilian&#xD;
Archduke no longer - broke the impressive silence that&#xD;
prevailed throughout the apartment in which was assembled an&#xD;
anxious, interested company. With uplifted hand, Maximilian&#xD;
,tood in their presence, before the mitred Abbots of Lacroma&#xD;
And Miram r, and the friars of Mexico; and, taking the irrevo-&#xD;
cable oath of office' sealed his future for weal or woe.&#xD;
Spirit, that guides and ministers to the chosen ones of earth,&#xD;
and hath their happiness in charge,,art thou slumbering on the&#xD;
watch? Hath some foul-hearted gnome, with cunning sophistry&#xD;
and glozed words, beguiled thee of thy trust ?  Wilt thou not&#xD;
vouchsafe, ere it is too late, one whispered, Beware ! " that&#xD;
shall call up the echo of those wrathful voices of the beasts of&#xD;
prey, that lie hidden adown that flowery path ? Save the&#xD;
pure, the noble, the good, from an untimely sacrifice !&#xD;
There is a hush in ghe assembly'; and the Royal Prince puts&#xD;
forth his hand and grasps a sceptre ; and there, too, is the glit-,&#xD;
tering crown. Alas ! that he can see no farther. Look away&#xD;
in the distance, down the vista of years;&#xD;
"'The war drum is muffled, and black is the bier ;&#xD;
The death -bell is tolling-- Oh ! Mercy, dispel&#xD;
The sight that it freezes my spirit to tell ! "&#xD;
"False wizard, avaunt !"&#xD;
"'Long live the Emperor of Mexico ! Long live the Empress&#xD;
Carlotta ! " rings out in gladsome tones.&#xD;
" Mexico hath been born again ! "&#xD;
Se Hor Gutierrez Estrada, the chief of the, Commissioners,&#xD;
knelt in homage, and' kissing the hand of his newly-proclaimed&#xD;
monarch, was the first to yield allegiance to him.&#xD;
It was a royal assemblage. of princes and nobility, that had&#xD;
&#xD;
come to Miramar from all parts of Germany, to see the Arch-&#xD;
duke accept the crown, and to bid him adieu.&#xD;
There was the Emperor of Austria, Francis Joseph, and the&#xD;
young Archduke Louis, standing near hin. There was the&#xD;
Commissioner of Napoleon of France, General Froissart ; and&#xD;
the Imperial delegate, Sehor Hurbet. Near them stood the&#xD;
Belgian Minister to Austria, exchanging from time to time whis.&#xD;
pered comments with the ladies of honor who stand near the&#xD;
Empress Carlotta.  At the entrance of the door is the Grand&#xD;
Master of Ceremonies ; while near him, are seen Counts Kheven-&#xD;
huller and Isolani, who regard the scene with deepest interest.&#xD;
Near the centre of the room stood the Emperor and&#xD;
Empress elect. Maximilian wore the magnificent uniform of an&#xD;
Austrian vice-admiral, which position he was so soon to resign ;&#xD;
while upon his breast, gleamed the stars and crosses of the var-&#xD;
ous orders to which he belonged. And the Empress Carlotta, at-&#xD;
tired in an elegant rose-colored silk, the diamonds flashing upon&#xD;
her person at every turn, seemed indeed the queen of beauty&#xD;
and dignity, and worthy to wear the brightest diadem of earth.&#xD;
A royal pair they were; they two, whose fortunes lay in the&#xD;
path that stretched out before them now, into an unknown&#xD;
future ; but the star of hope gleamed almost visibly upon the&#xD;
noble brow of the one, while in the gentle eye of the other shone&#xD;
the holy light of love,.devotion, and trust.&#xD;
Just in front of the heavily-carved table, behind which they&#xD;
stood, and on which lay various state and official documents,&#xD;
were ranged the members of the deputation,, forming a half-cir-&#xD;
cle; the President and the abbots standing nearest the Empe-&#xD;
ror.&#xD;
And now the oath of office taken, while the company offer&#xD;
their congratulations and good wishes to the Emperor, the&#xD;
castle guns send their booming messengers out over the waters&#xD;
of the Gulf; until, in the stillness of the morning air the ships&#xD;
in the, harbor at Trieste catch the echo, and answer with thun-&#xD;
dering voice, the signal, that tells of a new-made Emperor to&#xD;
the proud " House of Hapsburg."&#xD;
With smiles and laughter,with joyousness and mirth, the com-&#xD;
pany proceeded to the splendidly-decorated chapel of the palace;&#xD;
where, after thanksgivingand praise, offered before the altar&#xD;
by the abbots, the magnificent strains of the " Te Deum Lauda-&#xD;
mus " sound- forth from the organ. With united voice goes&#xD;
up the sublme prayer, louder and louder grows the chant, as&#xD;
each soul feels the words that fall from the lips, -&#xD;

"o Lord, save thy people, and bless thine inheritance,&#xD;
Govern them, and lift-them up forever !&#xD;
Day by day, we magnify Thee ;"&#xD;
And we praise Thy name forever ; yea forever and ever."&#xD;
Maximilian of Austria is a monarch !&#xD;
The'day passes-away ; and the guests depart, leaving behind&#xD;
their sincere, wishes for the future good and happiness of the&#xD;
young Emperor and Empress.&#xD;
" Maximilian, may God bless you and keep you !" whispered&#xD;
the Emperor Franz Joseph, as, with a tear in his eye, he throws&#xD;
his arm about his brother, and gives him a last affectionate em-&#xD;
brace.&#xD;
They were all gone, when the last beams of the sun -fell&#xD;
across the castle turrets; all, save those who are to accompany&#xD;
the royal party to Rome, where, in their voyage they will stop&#xD;
to receive the blessing of the Holy Father.&#xD;
The day had been so full of bustle and excitement, of coming&#xD;
and going, that Maximilian had scarcely been able since the&#xD;
morning light to collect his thoughts ; and he therefore hailed&#xD;
with joy, the coming of the night, when he could hold once more,&#xD;
perhaps for the last time at Miramar, communion with his own&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
The glorious moonlight tipped with its silvery beams the&#xD;
crested waves of moving water, that shone with brightness, save&#xD;
when now and then a vaporous cloud floated overhead.&#xD;
An air of quiet pervaded the palace. Worn out with fatigue,&#xD;
all had retired to -rest"; all, but the one who kept a voluntary&#xD;
sentinelship on the parapet that overlooked the sea; his favor-&#xD;
ite resort when anxieties or cares pressed heavily.&#xD;
Maximilian trod his stony walk, an Emperor !&#xD;
" An Emperor ! " murmured the waters below ; "An Em-&#xD;
peror !" softly echoed the cooing night-bird amid the dew-kissed&#xD;
flowers of the garden behind ; and gently, the aroma-scented&#xD;
breeze whispered in his ear, " An Emperor ! an Emperor ! "&#xD;
All was in unison, save his own soul, where tumultuous emo-&#xD;
tions warred for the mastery, each striving for utterance !&#xD;
When will Science, - omniscient, as it almost claims to be,&#xD;
fathom the depth of that mysterious current flowing between&#xD;
the heart of man, and what is wrongly called the soulless world&#xD;
around him?&#xD;
What is that strange magnetic influence in the voice of Na-&#xD;
ture, that penetrates the inner sanctuary, the sacred Pomoerium&#xD;
of .the heart, open to none, save the spirit visitors that come&#xD;
from a land-almost beyond the reach of thought ?&#xD;

CRO WY JEWELS.&#xD;

Deep calleth unto deep!"  So does that voice within our.&#xD;
selves, holy and solemn, and always inexpressibly sad, echo&#xD;
the Eolian strain of the wailing wind, or the Electra-like&#xD;
moanings of the sobbing sea, as it surges despairingly against&#xD;
the beach, recklessly dashing to and fro, like a restless, God-&#xD;
condemned, God-forsaken spirit, given up to an insatiate demon&#xD;
of chance !&#xD;
These are sacred hours; when the soul, at the bidding of&#xD;
the mystic voices around, seems almost to take tangible form&#xD;
and stand before us. And these communings come oftenest, not&#xD;
when the Fratres Arvales of the feathered brotherhood are&#xD;
carolling their joyous advent songs in greeting to the spring ;&#xD;
not when the summer's train is scattering peace and plenty;&#xD;
but they come when most needed ; when autumn's royal ?robe&#xD;
has been covered by December's mantle of snow; when perhaps&#xD;
brilliant hopes have been blighted by the touch of disappoint-&#xD;
ment; or lir hours of doubt and of trial, they come, dispelling&#xD;
the wavy shadows that hang over the soul; and breathing into&#xD;
the heart a spirit of strength, bids the man , "rouse up, and&#xD;
go forth, to be a hero in the strife !"&#xD;
Standing upon the farthest. corner of the parapet, looking&#xD;
far away over the sea, which now rises up and now recedes, the&#xD;
Emperor Maximilian put forth his hand, as if to hush the chant-&#xD;
ing- of wind and wave, to still the god-like fugue of Nature's&#xD;
great diapason, that he might give heed to the voice within,&#xD;
that spoke of power to his soul.&#xD;
This must be his last hour of weakness; to-night he must&#xD;
look backward for the last time. He turned his-eye upward,&#xD;
and there, bathed in moonlight, was his home in all its beauty&#xD;
and strength. And yet, to him, the walls seemed to wear a&#xD;
gloomy face, and seemed to frown upon him for deserting them.&#xD;
In three days he would leave this haven of happiness and safety,&#xD;
for a loftier, higher place. God grant that the foundations of&#xD;
the new home be firmly established, and may they stand the tem-&#xD;
pest sweep of years !&#xD;
Within those chambers, peacefully dreaming, was his beauti-&#xD;
ful Carlotta, for whose destiny he was responsible. Had he&#xD;
chosen a happy fate for her ?  Or did he lead her from joy and&#xD;
gladness to a land of terror and woe; even though she, too,&#xD;
said to him, " Let us go "?&#xD;
Had he chosen wisely ? Would he be able to sustain him-&#xD;
self in the position he had taken?  Out of chaos and confusion&#xD;
could he bring beauty and order ; turn anarchy, desolation, and&#xD;

and blossom with the rose; and where had grown thorns, there&#xD;
should " come up the fir-tree, and instead- of the briar, the&#xD;

Why. did he doubt himself ? Where were his early teach-&#xD;

had Mexico called to him; "Come over and help us," and faith-&#xD;

lie.&#xD;
Lifting his hands upward, and turning his eyes to Heaven&#xD;

iould grow brighter, their reflected rays should glance athwart&#xD;
&#xD;

gether the storm-clouds to lower about and destroy him,-their&#xD;
pitiless fury should burst upon her head also; and when some&#xD;
angry wave swept both -from the sea of life to the changeless&#xD;
shore beyond the troubled waters, it should whisper to the&#xD;
rock-bound heights, that the stroke which. blighted his life and&#xD;
palsied his heart, left her own powerless to pulsate.&#xD;
.  It is high noon at Miramar; and the mid-day sun looks down&#xD;
in golden splendor upon a glorious sight. In the city of&#xD;
Trieste an universal holiday has been proclaimed, and the citi-&#xD;
zens, high and low, rich and poor, who love the name of "Max-&#xD;
imilian," have come out; some in handsome coaches and gaudy&#xD;
trappings, others more humble on foot, but all helping to fill the&#xD;
palace, the garden, the beach, with lookers-on, who in their&#xD;
souls echo the " God speed !" that now and then bursts forth in&#xD;
united sentiment of sadness and pleasure.&#xD;
The magnificent Austrian frigate Novara, that is to bear&#xD;
the royal couple over the treacherous main, lay in all her dig-&#xD;
.nity at the mooring. Beside her, the French frigate Thsmi&#xD;
whc is to escort them to Vera Oruz, floats   asproudly from her&#xD;
mast-head the Imperial colors. Here and there, flitting hither&#xD;
and thither like restless sea-birds, are the lesser boats of the&#xD;
Austrian navy, which are-to accompany the Emperor to Rome,&#xD;
where the party will touch, to seek the blessing of the Pontifical&#xD;
prelate on their crown.&#xD;
"Adieu ! adieu ! " has been said, again and again to thin&#xD;
animate and inanimate, echoed with smiles' and tears, with&#xD;
daughter, and with sighs.; and now the Emperor and Empress&#xD;

There is first, the Archduke Louis Victor, who accompanies&#xD;

of the Royal Household, Count Zichy ; and the Chamberlains,&#xD;

There is a moment of silence, and a sound of tinkling music&#xD;
is heard.&#xD;
" There, there ! your Majesty!" cried the Empress, turning&#xD;
to the Emperor; "there is an offering for us! Listen !"&#xD;
Attracted by the Empress's words, the party on deck ceased&#xD;
their gay jests, and looked in the direction to which she&#xD;
pointed. 9n a projecinoladt          rnou ners to th&#xD;
p     vesselet still so far off as to almost drown the sound of her&#xD;
voice-, to  an old woman, dressed in a queer Italian costume,&#xD;
grinding ap organ, and singing in a broken, cracked voice:&#xD;
"over the sea--over the sea,&#xD;
Glory and greatness&#xD;
Are waiting.for thee !&#xD;
Over the sea - over the sea,&#xD;
Power and Princes&#xD;
Shall bow before thee."&#xD;
The old crone had raised her voice to its highest pitch, and&#xD;
in broken syllables, her words just reached the ears of those&#xD;
who listened. .&#xD;
" A  happy prophecy, your Majesty! " cried Count Isolani,&#xD;
who stood near the railing.&#xD;
" Oh! that we could toss her a sovereign!" said the Em-&#xD;
press, as she waved her handkerchief in friendly token to the&#xD;
old Gitan ; while she spoke, there was a great gathering up of&#xD;
the sleeping energies and strength that lay in the Novara, and, ~&#xD;
amid the loudest, heartiest, longest shout of the watching multi-&#xD;
tude she begins her voyage, and is outward bound. The Thrnis&#xD;
falls inthe train; then come the various vessels that make up the&#xD;
little fleet  Onward they move, in quiet dignity, slowly at first,&#xD;
but with each giant heaving they plough 'the main faster and&#xD;
faster, u til even those who stand anxiously watching with&#xD;
spy-glass, to keep sight of the fluttering flag that grows smaller&#xD;
and smaller --see but a little speck ; that is fading --more&#xD;
and more --until the mast-head is almost gone ; then, there is&#xD;
naught t be seen, save the 'waves of the Adriatic rolling in&#xD;
blue beneath, and the cloud-isles floating. lazily in the sea of&#xD;
ether above.&#xD;
Away, away, go the people back to their homes -back to&#xD;
business, to begin again the toil that verifies the old curse, that&#xD;
"man sh 11 live by the sweat of his brow." Some with tender&#xD;
hearts ph ek, as they pass, a rosebud'-in mernoriam- from the&#xD;
garden. lAlas ! now, roses and jessamines may blossom and&#xD;
bloom there, and fling their sweetness to the breeze all unheeded.&#xD;

The gentle changes of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, may .&#xD;
go by unmarked ; for to-night, when the sun in sympathy has&#xD;
hid his face, and the moonbeams are sent softly in to offer con-&#xD;
solation ; so through the rooms of the deserted palace, where all&#xD;
has so recently been pomp, and splendor, and ceremony -that&#xD;
are there still; instead of musical laughter, there is heard a&#xD;
soft echo -that murmurs sadly : "W  are left alone !" There&#xD;
is none, to whom Miramar may whisper the story of its desola-&#xD;
tion, save the Ocean Queen, that, now and then borne on the&#xD;
passing wave, lingers to drop a tear of sympathy.&#xD;
Three days have passed away, and borne onward by wind and&#xD;
wave, the Novara and her train have reached the Italian port&#xD;
of Civita Vecchia ; where, amid the shouts and welcome of&#xD;
those who have come down from Rome to meet them, they dis-&#xD;
embark, and the',eventide finds them in the Eternal City.&#xD;
Two days and nights of banqueting and greeting at the mag-&#xD;
nificent palace which had been prepared for them. Now their&#xD;
Majesties are seen-in the Grand Saloon, surrounded by admiring&#xD;
friends ; or again, standing in the Plaza of St. Peter's, regarding&#xD;
with wonder the stupendous pile; or, dreaming amid the ruins&#xD;
of the Coliseum, as the moonbeams shimmer over the crumbling&#xD;
seats of the old amphitheatre. And lastly, the wonders of. the&#xD;
Vatican attract them; and there, they receive the sacred unction&#xD;
and blessing of the Holy Father, and then they are ready to&#xD;
depart, it may be forever, from the Old World.&#xD;
And now, in truth, the Emperor Maximilian says "Fare-&#xD;
well! " Farewell to Austria and the Fatherland ; and with a&#xD;
heart filled with the loftiest ideas of ambition he seeks his&#xD;
future beyond the broad waters of the Atlantic. Wargus has&#xD;
thrown the grass over his shoulder; has 'overleaped the frail&#xD;
paternal enclosure, and lets his plume float to the wind, and&#xD;
now looks upward, and presses onward greatness&#xD;
that lies in the path he has chosen.'h&#xD;
Through the Straits of Gibraltar, out of the Mediterranean&#xD;
into the wide ocean, the Novara, followed by the Tmis,like&#xD;
a stormy petrel, skims the wave.&#xD;
Almost during the entire day the royal pair remain on deck,&#xD;
watching the shores of the Old World grow fainter and fainter&#xD;
At last the evening sun, rolling in red billows, sinks beneath the&#xD;
boundless horizon, where the sky and ocean blend in misty&#xD;
vaporous unity.&#xD;
The members of the court had gathered together for a social&#xD;
evening in the saln; somne indulging in cards; others engaged&#xD;

and ceremony gave place to the spirit of the sea, - the sea&#xD;

The Emperor and Empress stood alone on deck, leaning over&#xD;
he railing that enclosed the guards.&#xD;
Carlotta looked downward into the blue ocean gleaming with&#xD;
hosphores ent light.  Maximilian's eyes are upward-turned,&#xD;
as if he sought tq ask from the God who controls the mystic&#xD;
movements of the sidereal orbs a solution of the life-problem&#xD;
which he must work out.&#xD;
"Ye starsI which are the poetry of heaven !&#xD;
If in your bright leaves we would read the fate&#xD;
Of men and empires --'tis to be forgiven,&#xD;
That in our aspiration to be great,&#xD;
Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,&#xD;
And claim a kindred with you; for ye are&#xD;
A beauty and a mystery, and create&#xD;
In us such love and reverence from afar,&#xD;
That fortune, fame, power, life, have named themselves&#xD;
A starI"&#xD;
"The moon is up; by Heaven, a lovely eve ! " exclaimed the&#xD;
Emperor, recalling his thoughts.  "Carlotta, my own, are you&#xD;
dreaming ?"'.&#xD;
His tones were soft and low, with that peculiar musical ac-&#xD;
cent that in the very words convey a caress to the one ad-&#xD;
dressed.&#xD;
4"Are you dreaming, Carlotta, of what we have left behind,&#xD;
or of what we are to meet, in the shadowy future?"&#xD;
" Shadowy future, Maximilian?" said Carlotta.   "I see no&#xD;
shadows !  As the old Gitana said ; 'Glory and greatness are&#xD;
waiting for thee !' You go to fill a position honorably and&#xD;
faithfully tendered to you. The voice of Mexico, the voice of&#xD;
nations, call you to a throne, and 'equity injustice,' mercy and&#xD;
love, shall be the national mottos. Ah! Maximilian, I have&#xD;
no fear.  If there be enemies in Mexico, they cannot fail to be&#xD;
overcome by kindness; even Benito Juarez himself will not be&#xD;
able to refuse the olive branch!&#xD;
"-My little diplomat!/ " said the Emperor, half playfully, "you&#xD;
make me feel that the crown should rest on your head, not&#xD;
mine ! Carlotta, how I thank you, how -I bless you for the&#xD;
words of strength and hope, for the faith and trust you give to&#xD;
me, and how I thank God for the gifts of mind and intellect&#xD;
that He has bestowed upon you ! But let us dismiss affairs of&#xD;

As he' spoke he drew her tenderly towards him, And im-&#xD;
printed a kiss upon her brow.&#xD;
"Sing, my darling, the 'Ave Maria.' We will carry it in'&#xD;
our hearts, go where we may."&#xD;
"Ave sanctissima ! we lift our hearts to thee;&#xD;
Ora pro nobis I'tis nightfall on the sea*!&#xD;
Sweet mother, sweet mother, hear ! "&#xD;
The Empress began her song.   With her long dark hair&#xD;
loosened from the comb that had fastened it, falling about her&#xD;
shoulders; her beautiful face, with the soul-lit eyes upturned so&#xD;
ha the moonlight rested softly upon them, she seemed the&#xD;
spirit of music itself, chanting of devotion and faith. Her&#xD;
voice, strong, clear, and   silvery, stole out on the evening air,&#xD;
and the deep basso of the Emperor, joining at the last swelled&#xD;
the requiem-like straps othehe prayerful offeri-tet&#xD;
foam-be mlthat were ever dancing on the wavelets as they came&#xD;
and went, caught the refrain, and whispering one to another&#xD;
echoed it away away, until in the deep heart of the ocean&#xD;
melody and words were hushed.&#xD;
"Ave Maria! 'tis nightfallon the sea!"&#xD;
"One more, Carlotta ! one more," whispered the Emperor&#xD;
Your voice goes to my heart to-night n      n     m o&#xD;
"The one," said Carlotta, "that was sung at  nermaren&#xD;
in your absence lonely hearts mourned for your return."&#xD;
The Empress, who understood English perfectlyun&#xD;
it with a soft, pure accent, began that old air, dear to so ke&#xD;
hearts,                                     erts many&#xD;
"O'er the far blue mountain,&#xD;

have never gotten over the melancholy pleasure that creeps&#xD;
into one's heart. Byron's magnificent 'Farewell to England'&#xD;
involuntarily rises to my lips."&#xD;
"Repeat it, repeat it, Maximilian," cried Carlotta, eagerly.&#xD;
Standing with one hand upon the low railing, and an arm&#xD;
encircling his wife, in low, melodious tones, as if the sentiment&#xD;
found voice in the silent chambers of his own soul, Maximilian&#xD;
repeated: that exquisitely touching lament of an unhappy,&#xD;
lonely heart:&#xD;
"Adieu, adieu! my native shore&#xD;
Fades o'er the waters blue,&#xD;
The night winds shriek; the breakers roar ;&#xD;
And shrieks the wild sea-mew.&#xD;
You sun that sets upon the sea&#xD;
We follow in his flight,&#xD;
Farewell awhile to him and thee,&#xD;
My native land, good-night.+&#xD;
" And now I'm in the world alone,&#xD;
Upon the wide, wide sea;&#xD;
But why should I for others mourn,&#xD;
when none will sigh for me?-&#xD;
Perchance my dog will whine in vain&#xD;
Till fed by stranger hands ;&#xD;
But long ere I come back again,&#xD;
He'd tear me 'where he stands.&#xD;
"With thee, my bark, I'11 swiftly go&#xD;
Athwart the foaming brine;&#xD;
Nor care what landthou bear'st me to,&#xD;

Welcome, welcome, ye dark blue waves!'&#xD;
And when you fail my sight,&#xD;
Welcome, ye deserts and yecaves;&#xD;

-" A dreary plaint ! " said the Emperor, as he finished. -' Poor&#xD;
Byron! truly infelix/     Gifted, impassioned, and erratic; wear-&#xD;
mg a coronet placed upon his brow by Genius herself; yet mis-&#xD;
erable, undone, from his own vices ! Unhappy, lonely, and love-&#xD;
less he died; and found but few to weep over his tomb, and&#xD;
fewer still to do his memory justice.     The bitter, misanthrop-&#xD;
ical nature which was unfortunately his heritage, and for which&#xD;
he was hardly responsible, since it was constitutional, still had&#xD;
many redeeming points; and occasionally, when the mists were&#xD;
dispelled that enveloped his heart, there were glimpses of light,&#xD;
of soft, tender light, discerned amid the flashes of genius, that&#xD;
told of the fires of human love and kindly sympathy burning&#xD;
within."&#xD;

poetic eloquence, plead his cause; and, casting light over the&#xD;
dark shadows of his nature, leave his name and memory within&#xD;
the range of pity and forgiveness. Had Lady Byron clung to&#xD;
her husband, and exercised one-half the long-suffering and for-&#xD;
bearance that glorifies thousands of 'Love's silent martyrs,' who&#xD;
have worn out their lives, enduring and forgiving, perhaps Time,&#xD;
with the holy ministry of love and truth, would have exorcised&#xD;
those 'flesh phantasms' that haunted and polluted Byron's&#xD;
soul; and the seraph watchers that had veiled their faces and&#xD;
wept over his degradation, might have swept with angelic wing&#xD;
through the 'god-like temple;' and as they passed, touched; his&#xD;
harp, and breathed into the strains a divine -spirit, that would&#xD;
have given him a crown of glory in eternity ! And yet," she&#xD;
added sadly, "think of his lonely death in a strange land ! "&#xD;
"But you forget, Carlotta," said the Emperor, "in the im-&#xD;
pulse of your generous heart, and in your admiration of By-&#xD;
ron's genius, that there ran through his nature a vein of wild mel-&#xD;
ancholy, that at times, deepening into nervous despair, betrayed&#xD;
him into acts which perhaps rendered Lady Byron's life almost&#xD;
unendurable. Byron sinned, and his wife suffered ; how deeply,&#xD;
no one can ever know; but there must have been vital causes&#xD;
to induce her to pursue the course she did ; for no true woman,&#xD;
I am convinc d, high or low, so long as she sees the least hope&#xD;
of reforming or saving a man, will desert .him. The spirit of&#xD;
black, bat-like melancholy was, we say, constitutional with By-&#xD;
ron; but, for that reason, it did not call for the sacrifice of&#xD;
Lady Byron's life and peace. She felt, doubtless, that no&#xD;
change of time or place could make her husband aught but&#xD;
what he was : her influence was nothing, and there was no hope&#xD;
in the future; so'she left him, and in the eyes of the world&#xD;
stands justified. Each had their friends who appreciated&#xD;
them; and now the shadow-of the grave has closed over both,&#xD;
and death throws about them the halo through which charity&#xD;
ever views the actions of weak human children."&#xD;
There was a silence, and both Maximilian and .Carlotta were&#xD;
lost in deep musing.&#xD;
" See !" exclaimed the latter at last, ' "how the white foam"&#xD;
rises in the path of the ship, and how the lights in the 'hsmis&#xD;
gleam over the water:! How fast we go ! onward, onward to&#xD;
a new home ! It will seem very strange at first to be in&#xD;
Mexico. The manners and customs of the people are sokdiffer-&#xD;

"Philosophy teaches us, Carlotta, that he is a wise man who&#xD;
esteems himself a citizen of the world, a true, contented cos-&#xD;
mopolite. Learning a lesson from one of the ancient sages,&#xD;
who pointed to Heaven as his country, mere change of place&#xD;
should never bring discontent nor repining. Varro, who,&#xD;
among the Romans was a fountain of wisdom, argued that&#xD;
Nature is the same everywhere ; and that, that single circum-&#xD;
stance should be sufficient to reconcile a man even to exile or&#xD;
banishment. Yes; we have the same God everywhere to send&#xD;
the budding Spring and luscious Summer, the glorious Autumn&#xD;
and the hoary Winter. Neither does humanity, in its general-&#xD;
form, change its aspect. We see everywhere the same great&#xD;
tide of mortal life ebbing and flowing ; influenced by the same&#xD;
principles of virtue and vice, and bearing all onward to the one&#xD;
haven - the death-kingdom, at last. And, Carlotta," he whis-&#xD;
pered, "we shall keep the same:hearts throbbing in unison ; and&#xD;
while we have faith in God, faith in love, and faith in our-&#xD;
selves, we shall be happy ! "&#xD;
" Yes, Maximilian, we shall not only be happy ourselves, but&#xD;
shall make our subjects so. It is no low, selfish ambition, no&#xD;
maddening, insane love of power, that leads you to Mexicp;&#xD;
but a deep, sincere feeling that it is for her good, for your good,&#xD;
and for, the world's' good ; and relying, as you say, upon our&#xD;
strong faith, supported by a stronger will, Mexico, our country,&#xD;
must shine as we would see her in the national galaxy ! "&#xD;
The mists were gathering, and hanging heavy and damp over&#xD;
the vessel, before the Emperor and Empress retired from the&#xD;
deck.&#xD;
Silence in power waves her sceptre over land and sea, and&#xD;
all things bow before the mandate of repose.&#xD;
" Creation sleeps !"&#xD;
And as, in the vision of Zachariah, the messengers answered&#xD;
unto the angel of.the Lord that stood among the myrtle trees.:&#xD;
"We have walked to and fro through the earth; all the earth&#xD;
sitteth still and is at rest," so on the sea, as on the land, there&#xD;
brooded the same unbroken spirit of quietude. -No sound was&#xD;
heard save the rolling waves of the restless ocean keeping time&#xD;
with the dropping sands, as the hours go by, echoing the "All's&#xD;
well! " of the pilot at the wheel.&#xD;
The midnight hours are waning, and the night grows on&#xD;

The Emperor was indeed right. God and nature are the same&#xD;

Empires may rise and fall; nations may shout and groan;&#xD;

in vain over thy bosom, whose movements are controlled only&#xD;

" Adios, Giulian ? You leave Querataro ?"&#xD;
"To-morrow," replied the fir t speaker, a tall, -hand-&#xD;
some young man; bearing in his dark, rich complexion&#xD;
the mark of Spanish blood, had not his words been in that&#xD;
musical language. His companion was a young girl of extra-&#xD;
ordinary beauty, and seemed, from the shade of sadness gather-&#xD;
ing on her face, not well pleased with the communication he&#xD;
had made.&#xD;
They stood near the open casement, at the south end of the&#xD;
drawing-room, and looked out upon the glorious sunset view.&#xD;
There was the valley in which the city of Querataro stands,&#xD;
stretching away - away; now bathed in golden light, now fall-&#xD;
ing into deep shadow, until at last it is lost to sight ; and the&#xD;
distant hills, half enveloped in mist, loom up grandly and&#xD;
solemnly behind. The soft southern breeze that had kissed those&#xD;
giant hill-tops, played through the curtains; lingering for a mo-1&#xD;
ment in the grand drawing-room, listening stealthily to the love-&#xD;
promises of the betrothed ; and then, with sudden thought of&#xD;
those, who on fevered couches in the city beyond, are languish-&#xD;
ing for its soothing breath, impatient at its long delay, with&#xD;
gentle rebuke, and chiding of its careless, thoughtless heart,&#xD;

"No ; General Meija will still remain here ; but&#xD;

bably reach Vera Cruz in a week, and will be receive&#xD;

" Then, I guess rightly," said Inez quickly, a smile&#xD;
passing over her face. " You do not intend withdr&#xD;
the Imperial army, as I feared, but will offer .your&#xD;
the Emperor himself ? "&#xD;
" Withdraw from the Imperial army? " said the yo&#xD;
reproachfully, as he glanced lovingly at the gold-er&#xD;
uniform he wore; "why, the cause of the Empire i~&#xD;
one which will bring peace and prosperity to our poo&#xD;
and any ruler is welcomed as a saviour who will giv&#xD;
blessings, No, Inez; be assured I do not lightly ple&#xD;
to any one; but when once given, my word is as firm a&#xD;
I shall serve the Empire, and the Emperor as long as&#xD;
But, tell me of yourself !- I know that your brotl&#xD;
Juarez, and, now that we are politically enemies, his&#xD;
me is more intense than ever. Inez, you know ho&#xD;
and truly I love you: does this step sever the link be&#xD;
Which will you follow?"&#xD;
"Giulian," said the girl reproachfully, "have we k&#xD;
other from childhood so well, and still you read, n&#xD;
poorly? Gonzales goes his own way. My heart an&#xD;
pathies are with the Empire!"&#xD;
It was now the shadow on the lover's face that lifted&#xD;
and his dark eyes shone brightly beneath the large, fi&#xD;
" Now I am satisfied, my own," he exclaimed, "sin&#xD;
that in thought and heart we are not divided ! An&#xD;
future, Inez, you shall love me, not in the quiet, si&#xD;
that you now do, that makes me fear always, when&#xD;
near to guard.my treasure, another may come and st&#xD;

fervently, while he placed his hand upon his heart,"&#xD;
love in here, beating deep 'and strong, will not let y&#xD;

was something of triumph in his tone, as he so pr&#xD;
claimed to her his love, and his gaze rested tenderly'&#xD;
In a moment, again his voice softened and grew almos&#xD;

His voice sank to a whisper as he bent. over and gently drew&#xD;
her to him.&#xD;
" Giulian," said the girl, " have I not promised you long ago,&#xD;
that no one should take me from you? Even Gonzales with his&#xD;
hatred, cannot move me. Do not fear. I am my father's'own&#xD;
daughter ! " she continued, with sudden energy, " and when my&#xD;
word is pledged, no power on earth, nay, nor in the death-king-&#xD;
doms, can force me to falsify a promise ! "&#xD;
There was a hissing sound near them; and a rustling in the&#xD;
long curtains, that divided the drawing-room from the library.&#xD;
Captain Navarro and Inez looked hastily around. All was still&#xD;
--it was nothing; only the wind, that was again listening to&#xD;
their pledges.&#xD;
"Then I am forever content; for those words are a tower of&#xD;
strength to my heart ! But tell me, do Anita and yourself&#xD;
remain here alone, and unprotected?"&#xD;
" Humph!" said Inez with a little laugh, "old Pietro the&#xD;
gardener is quite strong enough to care for such poor, useless&#xD;
bootyas Anita and myself. As for Juan, -Captain Gonzales,&#xD;
under General Diaz now--you know he has been at home since&#xD;
the fall of Puebla. I do not think he will remain here long,&#xD;
though. Auita and I have no fear; though t.is lonely enough,&#xD;
and it would be more pleasant in Mexico City, where my uncle&#xD;
lives. All joy and happiness is gone from this home, since -"&#xD;
her voice faltered, and a vision of anguish seemed to pass&#xD;
before her.&#xD;
" I know, I know ! " said the lover, "a dark and evil day it&#xD;
was when Don Juan Gonzales was taken out of the world; not&#xD;
for you alone, Inez, but'for one, who, though orphaned, found in&#xD;
him a true father. But these are bitter things; and it is only&#xD;
harrowing the heart to recall them. Be comforted, dear one; and&#xD;
remember there is one who will care for you unto death! How&#xD;
does Anita seem to feel in regard to Captain Gonzales' course ?"&#xD;
" No drop of Aniita's blood runs in Juan's veins; she was the&#xD;
sister of my mother, not his, you remember; and he, thank God !&#xD;
is responsible for himself alone. How he can reconcile himself&#xD;
to- espouse a cause which he knows was, directly or indirectly,&#xD;
connected with his father's death, I cannot understand; but it&#xD;
shows forth most truly his utter want of feeling. No ; Aiita of&#xD;
the old Spanish school, is. heart and soul for the Empire!"&#xD;
" Then with -this good news I must go. There is one thing&#xD;
more, Inez -something you must give me to take with me; some-&#xD;

thing that shall breathe a reality into my life ; that shall make&#xD;
me strong, and brave, and hopeful, in the monthis~that may pass&#xD;
before I look into your face again. Promise me again, that, how-&#xD;
ever we may be parted, you will let none other come between&#xD;
us; that neither fear, nor doubt, nor shadow of doubt may ever&#xD;
separate us!"&#xD;
He drew her tenderly towards him: and in low, soft accents&#xD;
Inez answered solemnly:&#xD;
"I do promise thee, Giulian Navarro, that n' one, - that&#xD;
neither fear, nor doubt, nor shadow of doubt, shall come to&#xD;
separate me from thee."&#xD;
Again, there was a rustling m the curtain, but unnoticed now&#xD;
by the two, who were parting.&#xD;
" Adios, my own ! "&#xD;
" Bendicta, Giulian ! "&#xD;
Inez followed the young officer half-way across the apartment.&#xD;
As he went out, she turned back to hide the womanly tears&#xD;
that rose to her eyes, and found herself face to face with a man&#xD;
of dark, swarthy complexion, some ten years older than herself,&#xD;
dressed in the uniform of a Liberal officer.&#xD;
For a moment Inez stood in silence, looking up into the glit-&#xD;
tering, vengeful eyes that were bent upon her. The man was&#xD;
the first to speak.&#xD;
"Aye, thy father's own daughter !" he exclaimed in a voice&#xD;
of concentrated rage and scorn, "and a creditable descendant&#xD;
he has, truly! One of the house of Gonzalesclotting with a&#xD;
traitor; and Anita, too, the old wretch, has joined this beauti-&#xD;
ful league ! "&#xD;
The weakness was all gone from Inez, and her proud Spanish&#xD;
blood fired and burned in her veins at the taunts that her&#xD;
brother well-nigh hissed into her ear. "And thou, Juan Gonza-&#xD;
les, thy father's own son, in league with his murderers! How&#xD;
dare you," she exclaimed, "come into this house, clad in such&#xD;
guise, -an insult to his memory ?"  The commanding voice,&#xD;
so full of scorn and defiance, suited well the proud, queenly&#xD;
air, the girl unconsciously wore.&#xD;
"aHa ! " exclaimed the brother, 4you make love with an at-&#xD;
tache of the Imperial usurper, and faint at the emblem of Repub-&#xD;
lican freedom. And you, too, in your devotion to your Em-&#xD;
wortlhv uncle - who is prompted by a laudable desire to save&#xD;
his pieoperty - in kissing the dust upon which His Royal&#xD;
Majesty condescends to tread! A loyal pair, Captain Navarro,&#xD;

and his new convert ! May His Majesty have many such&#xD;
honorable followers, is the worst wish I can make for him !"&#xD;
continued the speaker, betraying, consciously or unconsciously,&#xD;
in his splenetic words, the mysterious rustling of the moment&#xD;
before; and disclosing also the honorable position he had occu-&#xD;
pied.&#xD;
"We shall see," said he, mockingly, "what these fine vows and&#xD;
promises between Giulian Navarro and yourself shall amount to !&#xD;
I am your natural guardian; and though naught shall come be-&#xD;
tween him and thee, yet I shall put this slight barrier between&#xD;
you! "drawing his sword fiercely from its sheath-" 1, too, bve&#xD;
an oath to record. I do solemnly swear to you here, by the&#xD;
God above, and by the strength that lies in this good sword, that&#xD;
never while I live shall Inez Gonzales wed this traitorous&#xD;
dog!"&#xD;
" That weak and wicked vow is not heard above: for Truth&#xD;
and Right," cried Inez, lifting her hands upward. "Truth and&#xD;
Right shall clash swords with thee, and dash thy vaunted&#xD;
strength to atoms!  You, my natural guardian ! Giulian Na-&#xD;
varro has been to Anita and myself more a relative and protec-&#xD;
tor than you have ever been ; and I will not 'longer listen to&#xD;
this abuse of one who has more honor and chivalry in one&#xD;
thought, Juan Gonzales, than you dan ever understand ! "&#xD;
A loud, sarcastic laugh greeted the girl's spirited words ;&#xD;
and Gonzales, taking a turn around the apartment, again&#xD;
stopped near her.&#xD;
" Ah! well, our high-tragedy queen ! " exclaimed he, "we&#xD;
have each indulged in. melo-drama quite enough. Navarro and&#xD;
I are enemies ; you and I are, I suppose, enemies too; but&#xD;
take care that I am not found the strongest in the end. I, too,&#xD;
have come to say Adios, but had almost forgotten it. I'have&#xD;
just bid Aflita farewell, -left her weeping, Hof course. How&#xD;

"You would send my soul to Heaven,&#xD;

awhich I very much doubt., I was seeking you, Inez, for an&#xD;
affectionate parting, when I caught a ghmpse through the&#xD;
lbaycurtains of your little- romance ; and though I per-&#xD;
mitted it to go on undisturbed, I quieted the hate in my bosom&#xD;
by whispering to it w'Bidehyour time.' I think, perhaps, you&#xD;

"cSpare me! spare me! " cried Inez, impatiently, "the recital&#xD;
of your victories and your strength!"&#xD;
" Ah! yo would have me off; and, doubtless, are reserving&#xD;
our patience and eagerness to listen to the details of the&#xD;
ompnd slender with which His Majesty will be received.&#xD;
eaven send destroying winds and wave, that he may never&#xD;

re No, no, Gonzales; do not curse Mexico with such a wish !&#xD;
This Emperor Maximilian will bring us life and peace ! No ; it&#xD;
is this opposition to a firm and stable government that would&#xD;
ruin Mexico. And you, Juan, can fight side by side with your&#xD;
father's murderers; aiding an unjust, unholy cause, whose fol-&#xD;
lowers know no mercy, but with greedy brutality shed the&#xD;
blood of their countrymen for a lump of gold ! "  She covered&#xD;
Lher face with her hands, and a convulsive shudder passed over&#xD;
her as she uttered the last words.&#xD;
" Inez, will you never cease your unjust accusations? You&#xD;
have no convincing proof that our father fell by the hand&#xD;
of the Liberals. That they wore the same uniform.is no argu-&#xD;
ment, since it can be easily adopted as a disguise by the bands&#xD;
of independent guerillas or robbers that infest thecountry."&#xD;
"Convincing proof; you say, is needed, Juan?  Ah! had you&#xD;
but seen them, as we did, you would ask no more ! A company&#xD;
of wild-looking men, armed to the teeth,.every word an oath or&#xD;
fearful threat, rushing into my father's room there, crying out&#xD;
in impatient haste and greed for 'gold ! gold!' and when to&#xD;
all the protestations of Anita, my father, and myself, that&#xD;
' there was none here: that all we had, had been sent to Mex-&#xD;
ico;' there was but one answer, 'You lie !' And at last, mad-&#xD;
dened by fruitless search 'and disappointed avarice, they fin-&#xD;
ished their work; and left Anita and myself despairing and&#xD;
weeping over our murdered dead ! Inez covered her face with&#xD;
her hands and a shudder ran over her frame.&#xD;
" But, Inez," said Gonzales, softened by the recital of his&#xD;
father's death, "there are bad men that will join every cause;&#xD;
ou should not condemn it, therefore, as unholy."&#xD;
"These men, you know, Gonzales, are not "the few" who&#xD;
have joined the Republican cause ; there are many such, fighting&#xD;
under the same banner, and God help us, when they are forced&#xD;
to disband, unless they are totally 'defeated ; for Juarez' guer-&#xD;
ima bands are like hungry wolves, ravaging friend and foe."&#xD;

" Well ! " cried Gonzales, with impatience, "they fight now,&#xD;
good and bad; for a noble cause, for the freedom of our country;&#xD;
and we must endure private wrongs for the public good."&#xD;
Our country?" said Inez. "I would die as willingly as&#xD;
Iphigenia, could I but bring peace to Mexico ! But, after all,&#xD;
what is a country and life without friends, with blasted hopes&#xD;
and murdered memories ?    Talk of -Republican freedom!&#xD;
What has Mexico's twenty-three Presidents done to elevate&#xD;
her in all these years past?  See what we are now: neither&#xD;
life religion,law, nor property is regarded; and I do cry out,&#xD;
Welcome-! to the one who will establish these monuments of&#xD;
civilization in our midst."&#xD;
"I have no time to listen to your sentimental raving," said&#xD;
the officer impatiently. 'I have stayed too long already. I have&#xD;
said 'Adios' to Anita ; but to you I will only say 'Au revoir ! '&#xD;
since we shall meet again, ere long, in the capital, where, we&#xD;
shall see the President of the Mexican Republic!"&#xD;
" Heaven forbid! "&#xD;
Heaven speed it ! And bear in mind one little point; that I&#xD;
am afraid you may forget: -never think yourself too secure;&#xD;
for neither prophecies, nor vows are lightly made by Juan Gon-&#xD;
zales! You know me of old, and know what to expect in the&#xD;
future ! Au r evoiI"&#xD;
Such was, the parting; ill-omeged for the future. It seemed a&#xD;
stange thing to call Inez Gonzales and the man who had just&#xD;
let wer brother and sister ; for' they themselves scarcely ac-&#xD;
nowedged the relationship. Their father, Don Juan Goza-&#xD;
les, had been a wealthy citizen of Querataro; and had met his&#xD;
death, a few days after the fall of Puebla, at the hands of a&#xD;
marauding party belonging to the Liberal army; who murdered&#xD;
him, because, as they imagined, he refused to yield to them his&#xD;
hidden gold. In his early manhood Don Juan Gonzales had&#xD;
come from Spain, with a brother; who, like himself, had set&#xD;
himself to work to accumulate a fortune in the new-found El-&#xD;
dorado. Their hopes were in a measure fulfilled; and Don&#xD;
Juan had married, shortly after reaching Mexico, a beautiful&#xD;
Mexican girl, who brought him a handsome property; butwh&#xD;
scarcely lived to enjoy her happiness five years before she died,&#xD;
leaving one son, the Juan Gonzales whom we have already&#xD;
seen. After the death of his wife, Don Juan had taken&#xD;
is   le son and returned to Spain to spend a few years&#xD;
ihis native land. During those years he loved a&amp;amp;nd wedded&#xD;
a beautiful maiden of Madrid; and he had brought her, with&#xD;

&#xD;
fond dreams of future happiness, to fill the void in his home&#xD;
at Querataro. But alas! she had proved too frail for the&#xD;
climate of the tropical region; and the first summer saw her,&#xD;
too, wither and die, leaving behind a little infant, Inez, to the&#xD;
care of the broken-hearted husband, and an older sister, who&#xD;
had accompanied them to Mexico, Donna Auita. From the&#xD;
period of his wife's death, Don Juan' Gonzales was changed.,&#xD;
After the first shock of grief was over, he had become stoically&#xD;
hardened ; and the free, warm sympathy that was before welling&#xD;
up in his heart for others, seemed to have dried up; and he was&#xD;
only a man' of the world, intent upon securing the golden treas-&#xD;
ure. And .he had succeeded ; he had amassed a magnificent&#xD;
fortune, and had made his home in the suburbs of Querataro'a&#xD;
habitation fit for a prince. There was one to whom he seemed&#xD;
to lean with tenderness, and on whom he lavished all care and&#xD;
attention, -the little Inez. Juan, his son, lacked for naught&#xD;
to make his boyhood happy; but it was on Inez, as she grew&#xD;
u   that the father's hopes seemed to centre. The best masters&#xD;
from Havana were procured to give her a thorough and fin-&#xD;
ished education ; so that, upon.reaching the age of seventeen,&#xD;
she was a most accomplished woman, speaking two or three&#xD;
different languages, and excelling in music, particularly on the&#xD;
harp, which was her favorite instrument. And yet, though&#xD;
possssed of so much knowledge of the world, - the natural&#xD;
world, -its wonders and treasures ; brought up in the con--&#xD;
stant companionship of Afiita, her father, and her masters,&#xD;
Inez had no practical ideas of life ; or of the great moving mass&#xD;
of humanity;- coming and going in the world afar :. her books&#xD;
and her home were all the world to her.&#xD;
Giulian Navarro was an orphan, and had been left with his&#xD;
property to the care of Don Juan Gonzales. As his father had&#xD;
been a strong friend, his guardian had taken him to his home,&#xD;
and brought him up as his own child.   Before time came&#xD;
for him to leave Querataro for school, the boy had declared his&#xD;
devotion to the little Inez; and when in later years it became&#xD;
the love of a man for the beautiful mairken, it met the cordial&#xD;
approval of Don Juan, who esteemed his ward for his real&#xD;
worth..&#xD;
But Juan, the brother, with a selfish, vindictive spirit that&#xD;
had betrayed itself in his childhood, and that only strengthened&#xD;
as he grew older, had found it impossible to live on terms of&#xD;
peace with his adopted brother; and when each had reached&#xD;
the estate of manhood, his sarcasms and jibes 'became insults;&#xD;
&#xD;
until at last Giulian had left the home, and gone to the cap.&#xD;
ital, to Don Juan's brother, to begin  life in earnest. The&#xD;
fortunes of war had thrown him, upon the occasion which .be-&#xD;
gins this chapter, in Querataro; and Inez, as a woman, again&#xD;
met her lover.&#xD;
A strange feeling it was Inez had for Giulian; she knew&#xD;
she loved him, and yet it was not that wild, intense emotion,&#xD;
such as she had read of in the old romances, -- an emotion, she&#xD;
could not understand at all. She wished she could feel such&#xD;
love for Giulian; because she knew it would make him so&#xD;
happy. She wished Giulian had been her brother, instead of&#xD;
Juan. Juan would not let her love him; and he hated not only&#xD;
Giulian, but herself, too ; and who cared if he did, tyrannical,&#xD;
overbearing spirit that. he was?  But she was very sorry he&#xD;
had made that vow ;, she was afraid of it - afraid of Juan; for&#xD;
when he tried he was terrible in intrigue, cunning, and re-&#xD;
venge.&#xD;
Inez left the window of the drawing-room, where she had&#xD;
been standing alone, while these thoughts ran through her&#xD;
mind, and passing through the hall~entered her aunt's private&#xD;
sittng-room, where she found Anita engaged as usual, over&#xD;
a    o      Spanish Romances;" so absorbed, that she was&#xD;
scarcely conscious that any one came in.&#xD;
nez quietly seated herself ona low ottoman at her feet, and&#xD;
looked up wistfully at the portrait of her mother, which hung&#xD;
just opposite. A beautiful, girlish face it was, half shaded by&#xD;
the long Spanish veil which was thrown over her head and-&#xD;
twined about her shoulders.  She had been dead now just&#xD;
eighteen years; and for eighteen years that portrait had hung&#xD;
there, draped around with black; and now the one beside it,&#xD;
er noble-lookig father, wore the pall, too.&#xD;
There was a long silence. Inez sat there gazing into the eyes&#xD;
of her dead parents; and Anita, in her stiff black brocade, and&#xD;
the straight-back arm-chair read on: she seemed a stately&#xD;
dame of the generation past.&#xD;
well, Anita," said her niece at length,"they'arebt&#xD;

AfiiA~a's wonderment playing about her lips, "no danger of&#xD;

to sta here through the long summer, and then straight on&#xD;
Sh wter: --only you, and I, and Pietro, and his old&#xD;

"Lonely!" exclaimed Anita; " why, Inez, I. never grow&#xD;
lonely!"c&#xD;
"Al  "no; you have those tiresome old 'Romances;' and&#xD;
then, you are not like I am."            .&#xD;
"But where are your resources? Your music, your books?"&#xD;
"Music, books! Aiita, I have read books until I am sick&#xD;
of them!. I know fictitious people, and dead people enough ;&#xD;
and am I never to know real, living ones, of flesh and blood ?&#xD;
Am I to live and dream away my life at Querataro, and die&#xD;
Swithoutknowingthat there are others in the world beside&#xD;

not have taken me away from this place, where, even in the&#xD;
springtime of my life, the waves of time are spell-bound, and&#xD;
we are in the magic of a dead calm?&#xD;
Inez had touched a new chord in Afita's heart. Never had&#xD;
she heard these restless pinings before, from her idol, who now,&#xD;
from her double orphanage, was more dependent upon her than&#xD;
ever; and though to-night she attributed the changein Inez to&#xD;
Giulian's departure, 'and the ideas he had given her of the&#xD;
gayety of the capital, during his recent stay in Querataro, yet&#xD;
the thought forced itself upon her, that perhaps, it was unkind&#xD;
and selfish to condemn one so well fitted to shme i society, to&#xD;
the strict retirement in which she had always lived. Aulita&#xD;
looked    Iez   lon admiration; andasked herself the girl's&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
INA1TL, timidly, over the blue waters of the passive&#xD;
sea, are creeping the beams of the morning. The rosy&#xD;
4     clouds of the dawn are urpling and paling in their&#xD;
changing tints, and sail over the calm sky in chaseof&#xD;
the fleeing night; and now and then, through the vapory folds&#xD;
eof the cirrus drapery, peer the winking stars, to catch before&#xD;
they go a glimpse of the coming King of Day. Soon, from behind&#xD;
&#xD;
the eastern rim of the distant ocean, the golden car of the mon.&#xD;
arch comes rolling up; changing with its reflective rays the mon-&#xD;
ple above to blue and white, and the crimson to burnished go&#xD;
revealing in every bubble of frothy spray, the rainbow colors&#xD;
of a diamond cluster.&#xD;
Softly the morning breeze kisses the face of the waters; now&#xD;
and then, with coquettish grace, stopping to toy, with aris-&#xD;
igwave, and then gone, like the swift-winged bird of the&#xD;
Fd gloomy days had come and gone since the No.&#xD;
var left the shore;.days when no ray of sunshine comforted&#xD;
the pale, clouded sky, that seemed to have sobbed itself into&#xD;
unmoved, tearless grief; but on this glad mo'&#xD;
One that holdeth the sunbeams in His hand had sent them, as a&#xD;
quiver of golden arrows, to electrify both land and sea.&#xD;
The vessels had sped onward, unmindful of clouds or shadows&#xD;
The exuberance of spirit, and the gayety withwhich the members&#xD;
ofthe troya party hadbegun their voyage, as if pre-determined&#xD;
that there should n edounss n        nnio    ba    d a&#xD;
given place to a quiet, even cheerfulness. Now and then, to&#xD;
while away the long hours of the morning, the gentlemen would..&#xD;
propose a game of cards; while some of the ladies would look&#xD;
over the  latest periodicals, novels, etc., which covered the&#xD;
tabe o th  8aon.Occasionally, sitting n a retiredconr&#xD;
might be seen a couple interested in a quiet game of chessrand&#xD;
judging from the time, that elapsed before the victorious shout,&#xD;
roh     was heard, each one must have been an oppo-&#xD;
ne wth f     a      rphy himself; it being a decided and&#xD;

cause, proves and confirms the skill of the players!&#xD;

hand was stayed by the Empress, who cried out hastily;-&#xD;
"'God save thee, Ancient Mariner!&#xD;
For thou would'st do a hellish thing,&#xD;
And it would work us woe ;&#xD;
For all aver thou'dst kill the bird&#xD;
That makes the breeze to blow."'&#xD;
An exclamation of merriment from those around greeted the&#xD;
Empress's superstitious words.&#xD;
" An albatross 1" exclaimed Senor Velasquez. No, no, your&#xD;
Majesty, not in these American waters.. But how it makes.&#xD;
One shudder to remember that fearful 'Rime!'           It made my&#xD;
blood run cold when first I read it, and truly I sympathized&#xD;
with the 'Wedding Guest.'&#xD;
'I fear thee, Ancient Mariner,&#xD;
I fear thy skinny hand ;&#xD;
And.thou art long, and lank, and brown,&#xD;
As is the ribbed sea-sand ;&#xD;
I fear thee, and thy glittering eyes,&#xD;
And thy skinny hand, so brown."'&#xD;
"Wind dead ahead !" sang out the pilot at the wheel. "CMon&#xD;

all your poetizing, you are bringing bad luck !     If we were in a&#xD;

"But listen, Countess, to the talisman that drives away evil,&#xD;
and unloosed the poor Mariner from the dead calm,-&#xD;
"'The self-same moment I could pray,&#xD;
And from my neck, so free,&#xD;
The albatross fell off, and sank,&#xD;
Like lead, into the sea.'&#xD;
" And you remember, Senor," said the Empress, turning from&#xD;
the Emperor, and the gentlemen, who had drifted into the sea of&#xD;
politics, the relations between France and Prussia, etc., "you&#xD;
remember the beautiful verse near the end,&#xD;
"'There was another, softer voice,&#xD;

a something lacking to make it complete ; a 'je ne sais quoi,,&#xD;
as the French would say," said the Empress.&#xD;
" And Southey?" said the se5or, "the one, who framed of&#xD;
Thalaba, the wild and wondrous song?"&#xD;
" Ah! he gives the low echoes, of the 'still, sad music of&#xD;
humanity!&#xD;
"And   hen, too, your Majesty, he has given to'woman her&#xD;
true place and clothed her in garments of spotless purity and&#xD;
innocence."&#xD;
"Do you know, Sefior," said the Empress,--" do you know, in&#xD;
recalling the names of the dead sons of genius, that my heart does&#xD;
not linger so lovingly about those whom the world delighted&#xD;
to love and honor, but turns rather to those whose spirits were&#xD;
chilled by the frost of criticism; whose hopes, beating strong&#xD;
in outhful ardor, were dashed by disappointment, and the crys-&#xD;
tal waters of the fountain within their souls were frozen by the&#xD;
coldness of those above them, who should have taken them by&#xD;
the hand, and bid them 'come up beside us, for ye are likewise&#xD;
our brothers !' There is a soft, pathetic tenderness about the&#xD;
names, of Kirke White and Keats, that ,commends them to the&#xD;
heart. Why is the world, great spirits and small, so loth to&#xD;
accord the meed to merit when deserved? Many, whose names&#xD;
are worshipped now, and whose tombs form a Mecca for admir-&#xD;
ing posterity, lived unhonored and almost unknown. When&#xD;
the voice of praise can give comfort to a struggling heart, it&#xD;
is hushed; but when the spirit, worn out with earth trials&#xD;
a     of fl ingingits soul's wealth away, soars to heaven,&#xD;
beyond the reach of mortality, then the diamonds are gath-&#xD;
ered together, and the world seems striving to re-animate the&#xD;
mouldering sleeper, by shouting forth, " A King hath been&#xD;
among us ! " Ah ! posthumous fame is a bitter, bootless re-&#xD;
ward for all this toilsome earth-striving !  'No flattery may&#xD;
soothe the dull, cold ear of death! "'&#xD;
Seuor Velasquez had listened, with rapt attention, to the&#xD;
earnest expressive words of the Empress.,&#xD;
" Ali! your Majesty," exclaimed he, with delight, "it takes a&#xD;
heart like your own to feel thus ! Mexico may indeed rejoice&#xD;
at her good fortune; for we know now, that your Majesty will&#xD;
extend a gracious patronage to foster and encourage genius and&#xD;

precepts of wisdom  in the. attractive guise of romance, are.&#xD;
great helpers in the task of elevating and refining the soul."&#xD;
"It is the earnest desire of both the Emperor and myself,"&#xD;
replied the Empress, to raise the standard of everything in&#xD;
Mexico to the proper level; to lift up the lower links in the&#xD;
chain of society, that now drag in the dust of wretchedness and&#xD;
ignorance. To do this, we know, that our-first care must be for&#xD;
the physical man. We must teach them to secure the comforts&#xD;
of life, before we begin to tell them of the cravings of an inner&#xD;
nature. Let the arts; the industrial arts, come first; and the&#xD;
sciences will follow. When the mind once shakes off the pall&#xD;
of ignorance and lethargy; as a prisoner unshackled or a bird&#xD;
uncaged, it delights in its new-found freedom  and power;&#xD;
though it tests them timidly at first, yet it longs'for a wider,&#xD;
broader range. Those who .feel the need of the life-giving princi.&#xD;
.ple in Mexico, I am convinced, will aid us in leading the masses&#xD;
from one stage to another, until educational advantages han be&#xD;
offered, and will be gladly taken hold of by all, both high and&#xD;
. And your Majesty this thing of education, has gotten to&#xD;
be a necessity in the path of civilization. Without it you can&#xD;
scarcely inculcate even a spirit of patriotism, national pride, or&#xD;
individual self-respect. And knowledge is-one of the few jewels&#xD;
that is divisible to infinity, and gains in the ratio that it is&#xD;
separated. Science, and its study is not intended to be a sealed&#xD;
book, open only to a learned few. The more it is simplified,&#xD;
the more it throws aside its technical mysteries and empirical&#xD;
attributes, the nearer it approaches its true mission, which is,&#xD;
to be a lantern in the hand of every honest seeker after truth,.&#xD;
illuminating for them the darkest recesses of nature, and dis-&#xD;
closng the gems that lie hidden there. Though, at the present&#xD;
time, the arts and everything is at such a low ebb in Mexico,&#xD;
yet it has not always been so. Under the Spanish rule,&#xD;
your Majesty remembers, . there were Academies of Sculpture.&#xD;
and Painting established, where pupils were taught free of&#xD;
charge; and, 'every night,' M. Humboldt tells us, 'in the spa-&#xD;
cious halls of these buildings, brilliafitly illuminated by argand&#xD;
lamps, hundreds of young men assembled ; some sketching&#xD;
from plaster-casts, or from life,  others, copying designs of fur&#xD;
nature, bronze ornaments, etc.; all classes were seen mingled to..&#xD;
gether,.- and the instruction was as freely given to the humble&#xD;
Indian youth, as to the son of the richest property-holder.' The&#xD;

Spanish Government. The influences of this tutelage, it is&#xD;
true have been lost among the people since he overthrow of'&#xD;
Spanish power, but they are still to be.seen i the buildings of&#xD;
the different cities, which are finished with poble and simple&#xD;
taste. Mexico has one name to show to j the world ; the&#xD;
sculptor Tolsa, whose work - the magmficent equestrian&#xD;
statue of Charles IV., is said to be worthy of the genius of&#xD;
country. It formerly stood in the Grand Plaza, infront of&#xD;
the National Palace, in Mexico City, but as it afterwards grew&#xD;
to be an eyesore to the Republican leaders, ome of them had&#xD;
it removed to the court-yard of the National Museum."&#xD;
"Ah 1 well! " said the Empress, "I trust we shall waken,&#xD;
up all the talent, which must be hidden somewhere in Mexico,&#xD;
and before five years will have rolled away,.we shall have&#xD;
poets, and writers, and artists enough to for  a literature and&#xD;
a school of painting of our own."&#xD;
"And to which shall we give the precedence -poetry or&#xD;
pose ?" asked Senor Yelasquez, smiling.&#xD;
pr"We shall be thankful for- both or either. The people will&#xD;
call for prose; the romantic, dreaming spirit will welcome the&#xD;
poet's muse. Poetry idealizes life for us; an  by the magic of&#xD;
single word, a half-sentence, reveals, to us a world of imagery&#xD;
and sentiment. In a fictitious story, which orms the majority&#xD;
of prose compositions, we look for something more : a plot,&#xD;
which interests the listener, by hinting at something hidden, to&#xD;
be disclosed at the proper moment. See the skill with which&#xD;
the writers who endeavor .to catch the 'Ivox populi,' who write&#xD;
for the masses, clothe their ideas and, conceptions; they' aim&#xD;
not so much at elegance of style and beauty of diction, but&#xD;
'gaintfavor with the multitude, by 'using pure Anglo-Saxon&#xD;
ut two syllables in length.' Herein lies the great charm&#xD;
of that English writer, Dickens. He has studied the varying&#xD;
humors of mankind, until with every stroke of his pen he&#xD;
gives you a -sketch of yourself, or your ne t neighbor. But&#xD;
what a gale the wind blows ! It doesn't intend we shall stay&#xD;
out much longer ! "&#xD;
Just then the veil that had protected her Majesty's head&#xD;
from the damp of the morning, was wrested away by the wind;&#xD;
and, toying hither and thither, it fell at la~st upon a crested&#xD;
wave, and was swallowed up by the rolling waters.&#xD;
"Your Majesty has been forced to yield 4 tribute," said the&#xD;
Emperor, approaching ; " but, fortunately, not a very heavy one,.&#xD;
It would be best perhaps to retire to the salon; for we are&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
.t&#xD;
&#xD;
likely to have a sharp, rough sea, if the wind continues at&#xD;
this rate. You know these tropical regions, Sefor; think you&#xD;
it will last?"&#xD;
"Not very long, I guess," replied Senor Velasquez, glancing&#xD;
up at the clouds floating in feathery 'lightness over the sky.&#xD;
" We are not near enough to the Gulf, I think, to apprehend&#xD;
a 'Norte,' which your Majesty will fully understand and ap&#xD;
preciate, when I tell you it is the same as the 'Bora' of the&#xD;
Adriatic."&#xD;
"A Bora ! Heaven forbid," cried. the Emperor, as they left&#xD;
the deck to join those within, who had grown tired, listening&#xD;
to the Empress and Senor Velasquez, and had long since sought&#xD;
the enjoyment of the salon.&#xD;
-    -    -    -   -    -         .    .    .   .&#xD;
The Thgmis had left the Nvara, behind, and was. pressing&#xD;
onward go reach the port, and prepare the inhabitants for the&#xD;
arrival of their ruler.&#xD;
As they neared the dreat Southern Gulf, a change began to&#xD;
be felt in the temperature of the atmosphere. The sky grew&#xD;
more intense in its azure hue, and at night the stars shone&#xD;
with increased brilliancy; the constellations were new  and&#xD;
strange to those who came from  northern latitudes; and in&#xD;
the waves, that had changed' their blue to green, could be seen&#xD;
the drifting sea-weed, while the soft breeze wafted the faint&#xD;
perfume of tropical flowers.&#xD;
Anxiously and, eagerly did the sea-wearyp passengers watch&#xD;
for surer indications, that their voyage was well-nigh over,&#xD;
and at last came the little 1 d - birds, as harbingers of goodve&#xD;
Noah's dove bearing the olive-branch could not have been&#xD;
hailed with greater delight by the patriarch's family than were&#xD;
these little visitors from shore, by those who watched them&#xD;
from the deck of the .Novara.&#xD;
At last, early in the morning of the 28th of May, from the&#xD;
look-out, above, there came the thrilling cry:&#xD;
"Land, ho !"&#xD;
Soon the quarter-deck was filled with the personages of the&#xD;
Court, each looking into the hazy distance, to catch the first&#xD;
glimpse of the Eldorado to which they were speeding.-&#xD;
Far away over the western water, rimming the broad expanse,&#xD;
and restig as a cloud against the bosom of the blue sky, rose&#xD;
the peak of Qrizaba, which with its eternal crown of snow, is&#xD;
indleed the "!Citlal Tepetl -the Mountain of' the star " - the&#xD;
frst beacon of hope that greets the seaman's eye.&#xD;

&#xD;
The gentle wind, "la brisa," lent her aid to the Novara, and&#xD;
she went onward with giant strides. Gradually a long sandy&#xD;
line of beach is seen; elevated spires and land-marks, that&#xD;
belong to Vera Cruz, next grow visible ; aid then, in grim&#xD;
majesty, the old fort, San Juan D'Uloa, frowns over the sea.&#xD;
How   many warlike memories thrilled the Emperor Maxi-&#xD;
milian's heart, as this mighty bulwark, with its ribbed sides of&#xD;
gray stone and its moss-covered battlements, loomed up before&#xD;
him in gloomy grandeur. The mounted guns, pointing threat-&#xD;
eningly' over the waters, seemed to, tell of the terrible time&#xD;
when but a handful of Spanish heroes held i for three years,&#xD;
against "God and men," as their historian chronicles.&#xD;
And now, as the Novara comes in sight, and the Themi8 and&#xD;
the French vessels in port go out to meet her, the roar of can-&#xD;
non is heard, and loud shouts from the dense crowd assembled&#xD;
on the beach, to welcome the new sovereign. Amid the cries&#xD;
of "Vive l'Empereur ! Vive l'Tmperatrice ! "in French, Span-&#xD;
ish and Mexican accent, the Novara, with its show of beauty&#xD;
and state on deck,, and the flag of Mexico flying at its mast-&#xD;
head, gallantly rounded to, and neared the quay.&#xD;
A faint, strangely, nervous feeling had tal en possession of&#xD;
Carlotta's heart at. the first cry of land; bkut as they came&#xD;
bearer and nearer, and Maximilian took Ier by the hand&#xD;
and led her to the deck, where the people might see her,&#xD;
and her ladies of honor stood about her, she knew that her-&#xD;
dream was at last a reality; knew that she was now an Em-&#xD;
press; knew that she must say adieu to the careless, unre-&#xD;
strained Princess-life, and bear herself with the dignity and.&#xD;
loftiness of one, who stood beside the chief of ta nation.&#xD;
Now the vessel has weighed anchor. Dignitaries and offi-&#xD;
cials press through the crowd, and are soon upon the deck,&#xD;
offering their words of welcome.&#xD;
Gen. Almonte, in behalf of the people of Mexico, presents to&#xD;
the sovereigns their Plessing, and their future promises.&#xD;
And now the party are conducted to the splendid - coaches&#xD;
which wait to convey them to the rooms fitted up for them,&#xD;
during their stay in Vera Cruz ; and amid the vivas of the&#xD;
people, they are rolled through the street, that -is ornamented&#xD;
and decorated at every turn with triumphal arches. Never had&#xD;
the 'old city seen such a gala time ; never had the hearts of all&#xD;
its citizens gone up in such universal shout of gladness. But&#xD;
alas ! in this joyous hour, when all is enthusiam, and- raptur-&#xD;
ous delight, there is no voice to whisper to the young hero, so&#xD;
&#xD;
full of faith and hope, as in the olden time to the -Spanish&#xD;
Cortez,-&#xD;
" Trust not their fair words: their courtesies, their gifts,&#xD;
their professions, are hollow; their friendships are false."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
o one who visits for the first time "la tierra caliente,"&#xD;
and knows naught of the hills and valleys of the&#xD;
Paradise back from  the sea-coast, nothing -can ex-&#xD;
ceed the aspect of loneliness and desolation that hangs&#xD;
around the city of Vera Cruz and its environs. Built upon the&#xD;
same plan with the other Mexican cities, a Grand Plaza,:or&#xD;
open square, in the centre; a cathedral on one side, and a&#xD;
hotel on the other ; the buildings and streets running at right&#xD;
angles in every direction; now andthen an old stone palace&#xD;
through the gates of whose court-yard is seen a ruined- foun-&#xD;
tain--the place presents .a dreary, deserted appearance, that&#xD;
cannot fail to imbue the beholder with a like impress of sad-&#xD;
ness. About the outskirts. of the city are scattered innuner-&#xD;
able adobe huts, the lowly homes of the half-bred Mexicans,&#xD;
who, living in squalid poverty, and being of daring, desperate&#xD;
disposition, exist like beasts of prey.&#xD;
Now and then, crossing the Plaza, or passing through the&#xD;
different streets, are seen men attired in the Mexican costume&#xD;
with slashed~ pants, and the 'sarape, or Mexican blankethang&#xD;
 mg about their shoulders; and dark, swarthy-looking women&#xD;
wearig, after their peculiar fashion, the rebosos, or bright-colored&#xD;
scarf; twined with an easy grace and becoming effect over the&#xD;
head, and falling loosely behind.&#xD;
This is what the .traveller sees, if he ventures to -look out&#xD;
from his window for a daylight view. Soon the city is vocal&#xD;
with the shrill cries of the morning venders:&#xD;
"Carbon, senor 1"  "  ecinca buena / good salt beef, senior ! "&#xD;
"Caremelos ! Cheese and honey ! Tortillas!"&#xD;
And now things grow more lively. - Ladies in black gowns&#xD;
and mantillas, are seen hurrying on to mass; 'while bodies of&#xD;
soldiery, in -,French uniform, at intervals dash through thestet&#xD;

making a clashing of swords, and a clatter if horses' hoofs&#xD;
striking against the stony paving.&#xD;
Very strange, and withal somewhat gloomy, appeared the&#xD;
prospect, in spite of its being a gala day, to te Empress Car-&#xD;
lotta, as she looked through the latticed windo into the wide&#xD;
streets, the morning after her arrival; and though gayly dressed&#xD;
crowds, as it grewlater, began to gather, the thought would&#xD;
present itself, that "surely over this city the prophet Jeremiah&#xD;
had sounded the denunciation of woe!"  Soo  her attention&#xD;
was called within, to aid the Emperor in receiving and ac-&#xD;
knowledging the welcome of the citizens who came in great&#xD;
numbers to greet them..&#xD;
The Emperor and Empress were both anxious to push for-&#xD;
ward to their capital; and before mid-day they were en route&#xD;
in coaches for Cordova. As the carriages that bore the royal&#xD;
party rolled through the streets, accompanied by an escort of&#xD;
French soldiery, balconies and windows were filled with eager&#xD;
people, watching to catch a last glimpse of their new Emperor&#xD;
and Empress; and, amid the shouts, and, waing flags and&#xD;
handkerchiefs, Maximilian and Carlotta bade adieu to Vera&#xD;
Cruz.&#xD;
The.way led them on, out of Purgatory into Paradise. Not&#xD;
easy it was at first - the rough, jolting roads, npw winding up,&#xD;
and again suddenly downward, as if mules, carriage, and all&#xD;
were going over the side of some precipice.&#xD;
The Emperor, Empress, Gen. Almonte, and Senor Velas-&#xD;
quez occupied the carriage in front ; next came Count Isolani,&#xD;
Countess Zichy, and the Countess Kollonitz; while in a third&#xD;
and fourth carriage were the Count de Bombells. and the other&#xD;
gentlemen of the Court.&#xD;
"Well," said the Countess Kollonitz, gayly, "this certainly&#xD;
is the pursuit of ple ure under difficulties ; but it's a long way&#xD;
that has no turnip, and I guess we shall be repaid after a&#xD;
while !'.-&#xD;
" Ah, yes, Countess; you will tell them, when you go back to&#xD;
Germany, that you found Ponce de Leon's ' Fountain of Youth,'&#xD;
in the beautiful Paradise that we shall presently enter ! "&#xD;
"Indeed, Count Zichy, I am afraid to carry back such a&#xD;
story with me; it would worle trouble for the Emperor, for&#xD;
there would be forthwith such a tide of emigration - old men'&#xD;
aid women, that Mexico could hardly hold them!".&#xD;
" You are not surely going to leave us, Countess ?" asked&#xD;
Count Isolani; " what Will our 0ourt be without you?"&#xD;
&#xD;
9 Yes; I shall go back perhaps in a couple of months. As for&#xD;
getting on without me, I shall miss our circle, I am afraid, more&#xD;
than they will me! I shall leave my place to some beautiful&#xD;
Mexican girl, that will soon teach you all to forget me. Her&#xD;
Majesty, you know, is to have her ladies all Mexicans, except&#xD;
Countess Zichy-here, to whom, with you, good friends, after I&#xD;
am gone, I do bequeath my memory, recommending myself to&#xD;
mercy!-"&#xD;
" Which you do not in the least deserve, since you are guilty&#xD;
of wilful desertion," replied Count Isolani.&#xD;
Just now they had reached the brow of a hill; and the carri-&#xD;
ages were greeted with shouts and cries from a crowd of Indians,&#xD;
who had come from their homes in the country, to see the&#xD;
Emperor as he passed. There were women in parti-colored&#xD;
petticoats, long straight hair plaited down behind, with their&#xD;
infants in slings on their backs; and the men, with dark, ex-&#xD;
pressive. faces looking out from beneath the wide-brimmed&#xD;
sombrero. As they pressed up closely, and with gladness and&#xD;
curiosity regarded the white faces of the Europeans within,&#xD;
their black piercing eyes seemed to dance with delight. As the&#xD;
carriages passed on, they gave vent to their joy in loud shouts&#xD;
and songs. Looking away down into a continuation of vale-like&#xD;
glens, the country was dotted with the little huts, which were&#xD;
their homes, and to which they now were seen returning,&#xD;
having met an era in their uneventful lives.&#xD;
While the Empress, Seuor Velasquez, and General Almonte,&#xD;
who had at Vera Cruz been appointed by his Majesty Grand&#xD;
Marshal of the Court - while they descanted on the increasing&#xD;
beauty of the country, the Emperor Maximilian's mind was&#xD;
filled with far weightier thoughts. To him, every spot of ground&#xD;
over which they passed, every tree, hill, and valley, were elo-&#xD;
quent with the great. events of centuries past. Imagination&#xD;
carried him back to the time when the Spaniards,-- whom. he&#xD;
felt to be his countrymen -pursued their way through this,&#xD;
country, under the guidance of a daring leader. I But Maximil-&#xD;
iap was unlike Cortez. While his heart thrilled at the beauties&#xD;
which now, at every foot of their way, greeted him, there was&#xD;
no thought of fear mingled with his delight, for in his heart&#xD;
there was no dream of conquest: all was love and friendship&#xD;
for the groups who, at every turn of the road, had een waiting&#xD;
for long hours to swear allegiance to him. Ue ad come to&#xD;
this land of eternal spring, at the call of these people, and did&#xD;

the trees in the woody country through which their road lay ;&#xD;
the variety of blossoms, flinging their beautiful purple and&#xD;
red over them as they passed; the delicious ardma of a thous-&#xD;
and tropical flowers and fruits, filling the air with fragrance&#xD;
seemed to his heart the welcoming which Nature herself gave&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
"Heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate,&#xD;
All but the page prescribed our present state !"&#xD;
How truly wise-! For could we but lift the veil that, spark-&#xD;
ling and glittering with a thousand diamond hopes, shuts off&#xD;
the future, and tempts us onward by the halo o~ glory thrown&#xD;
around our path, how often would we sink into despair,&#xD;
horror stricken, as we saw the result of actions and events, that&#xD;
we began with purest motive, actuated by the best intent of&#xD;
doing good. As it is, in the waving to and fro of this myste-&#xD;
tious curtain occasionally we catch a glimpse of our rOle upon&#xD;
the scroll of destiny, and we go down upon  our knees, appalled&#xD;
at the record of coming trials, of which even one glance "makes&#xD;
each separate hair stand on end." Where is the metaphysician&#xD;
whose practical experience or personal observation will sus-&#xD;

studied argument.     ..k&#xD;
But we stand in the presence of royalty! he jessamine-&#xD;
scented breeze that floats over the valleys, whispers naught of&#xD;
evil to the Emperor, and why does our voice of boding still&#xD;
follow him?&#xD;
Maximilian's memory was busy with the pa t; with those&#xD;
exploits of the Spanish band in the sixteenth entury, which,&#xD;
read to-day, seem the wildest dreams of ro ance; and he&#xD;
thought, as they passed along, of the immortal message that&#xD;
Cortez sent to his royal monarch: "At ever step we take,&#xD;
Truth, Religion, and Civilization advance."      .-     .&#xD;
During the-en~tire afternoon the party seemed4 toeexperience&#xD;
1o{ fatigue. Loaded with presents' of oranges and fruits at&#xD;
every- village they' passed, the novelty of their position filled&#xD;

CRO Y JEWELS.               81&#xD;
&#xD;
each heart; and the ladies gave vent to their admiration of all&#xD;
around them, the beauty-of the scenery, etc., in bursts of en-&#xD;
th siastic admiration.&#xD;
The evening shades found the party still -some iniles from&#xD;
the city of Cordova, but, as that was their place of destination,&#xD;
they resolved to press forward, and reach it during the night ;&#xD;
and though it was well spent, before the guard announced the&#xD;
city in the distance, it did not prevent the deputation of the'&#xD;
officials, and a torch-light procession, from coming out to meet&#xD;
and conduct them into the city, where the inhabitants had&#xD;
prepared a magnificent illumination, in honor of their com-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
But why should the reader be wearied by a detail of the&#xD;
banquets and receptions, the Te .Deum and offices of wor-&#xD;
shipful thasgiving that filled up the few days of their stay&#xD;
in Cordova; or, of the continued stream, of people, banners,&#xD;
flowers, and music that greeted them all along the road to&#xD;
Orizaba. Just before their entrance into the last city, in&#xD;
the midst of the immense crowd gathered about the carriage,&#xD;
the Indians, carried away by enthusiasm and joy, began, almost&#xD;
before it was known, to unfasten the mules from the carriage,&#xD;
in which their Majesties rode, and exclaiming, in their rude&#xD;
dialect,&#xD;
"We -your Majesty, your poor Indian children, that love&#xD;
you more dearly than you can know, - we, will draw you, our&#xD;
Emperor into our city;" and taking hold of the straps and&#xD;
irons, began to make good their words.  ,-&#xD;
"No, no ! " exclaimed the Emperor quickly, as he alighted&#xD;
from the carriage, and stood before them. " You are my dear&#xD;
children, and I cannot receive such homage as this. It is&#xD;
pleasant to meet you here, and receive this proof of your love&#xD;
for me, -a love which shall be repaid by the anxious care&#xD;
which I shall take to protect your interests, and to increase&#xD;
your good."     .&#xD;
While he spoke, the mules were placed back, and driving&#xD;
through the crowd, that divided for them to Pass, they were&#xD;
soon in the beautiful city of Orizaba. Here, it was but a repe-&#xD;
tition of their stay in Cordova. Presents from high and low,&#xD;
of fruits and flowers and palm-leaves; banquets, and a mag-&#xD;
nificent ball at the house of the French consul, made their stay&#xD;
a season of festivity indeed. And these cordialities were not&#xD;
unreturned. There were 'donations made by the Empress to the&#xD;
hospitals, which the Emperor and herself visited and inspected&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
in person For the poor they seemed to have especial thought;&#xD;
and not seldom were heard their loving words for the "good&#xD;
Empress and the dear Emperor." All were delighted with their&#xD;
new sovereigns. There was nothing distant and cold about&#xD;
them; and the people began to conclude that an Emperor was&#xD;
-almost as democratic a ruler as a President.&#xD;
At last they left Orizaba, and were en route for Puebla. As&#xD;
the city faded behind them, and they reached the brow of a&#xD;
hill beyond, and looked behind and around  hem, it was a&#xD;
lovely view that presented itself for their admiration. Far in&#xD;
the distance, were broad-spreading fields ofverna green; groves,&#xD;
white with blossoms, echoing with the matin songs of warbling&#xD;
birds; and crowning every ascent or rising height, were stately&#xD;
haciendas or moss-becovered convents, old and gray, while far&#xD;
behind nestled the little city they had left.&#xD;
As the carriages stopped for an instant, and they took in the&#xD;
lovely morning picture, "a breathing landscape," Carlotta and&#xD;
Maximilian exclaimed involuntarily, as if the same thought&#xD;
filled the mind of each :. "What a beautiful country we&#xD;
have !"&#xD;
But soon the aspect of the country begins to change : as&#xD;
they move onward, the solid European herbage succeeds the&#xD;
delicate tropical beauties, and they find themselves entering&#xD;
a barren, rocky, desolate region, through which they must pass,&#xD;
before reaching again the delightful valley.&#xD;
For leagues, as far as the eye can reach, nature wears a&#xD;
bleak, hopeless expression, as if mourning the loss of the clear&#xD;
streams and gorgeous flowers. The distant mountains, with&#xD;
their sides of Tartarean hue, barely support the cactus growth,&#xD;
that clings to them for sustenance.&#xD;
Now and then, in this " Evil Land," as. the .inhabitants call&#xD;
it, is seen a ruined hut or an humble shrine, whose cross, point-&#xD;
ing upward, seems striving to tell the traveller that "all deso-&#xD;
lation is not despair ; heavenly aid is near."&#xD;
Before one of these rudely constructed altars the royal party&#xD;
stopped, and gathered themselves to offer their devotions.&#xD;
It was a wild, picturesque scene, with a tinge of sublimity in&#xD;
it. They stood there with uncovered heads, in the presence of&#xD;
the "Maker of Heaven and Earth," away from the world its&#xD;
pomp and circumstance ; no burning tapers, no deep-sounding&#xD;
organ, no well-trained choir to chant the respo ses.; only the&#xD;
blue sky of God's temple above them, only the  weeping wind,&#xD;
the breath of God, about them ; and naught but the holy flane&#xD;
&#xD;
of heavenly love burning within their hearts, and. the solemn&#xD;
chanting of their own souls in spirit worship, as they rememn&#xD;
bered "The Lord is in his holy temple ; let all the earth stand&#xD;
in awe before Him!"&#xD;
The shrine, too, was left behind, and with the distant peak&#xD;
of Orizaba mount, guiding them as a pillar of cloud, the dis-&#xD;
tance to Puebla grows hourly shorter.&#xD;
The intervening stations, Perote, Nossaluca, and Amozoque,&#xD;
some in turn; and at each one, the hearts of the inhabitants&#xD;
must be gratified by being permitted to offer their attentions.&#xD;
A Mexican breakfast had been prepared at Nossaluca; --fri..&#xD;
joles,  tortillas,=- chili,* and the famous Maguey drink&#xD;
pulque, which no true Mexican ever refuses.&#xD;
And now, though miles away, begins the entranceto Puebla.&#xD;
a city of many thousand inhabitants, and of much wealth.&#xD;
The reception prepared was in keeping with the dignity of&#xD;
the place. An escort of carriages, horseirien, and footmen,&#xD;
numbering in all many thousand, with banners and flags, music&#xD;
and flowers, conduct them, through triumphal arches, which&#xD;
have been raised across the streets, to the magnificently deco-&#xD;
rated palace, where they are to be entertained.&#xD;
As it was near the Empress's birthday, the 7th of June, and&#xD;
a great festival and ball had been planned for its celebration, it&#xD;
was decided to remain over a few days in Puebla.&#xD;
The ceremony of delivering the keys of the city to his Maj-&#xD;
esty, which had been gone through with at every place at&#xD;
which they stopped, was followed by the chant at the cathedral,&#xD;
where the people, led by the Bishop, gave thanks to God for&#xD;
the blessing he had sent to Mexico.&#xD;
On the evening of the 7th of June was the grand birthright&#xD;
ball. Every street was illuminated; the triumphal arches still&#xD;
stood, and were freshly wreathed. The public hall,, where&#xD;
the reception was to be held, there was one blaze: of light ; and&#xD;
the stairway by which the Empress was to ascend was a very&#xD;
path of flowers.&#xD;
A grand and courtly gathering it was. Jewels and magnif-&#xD;
cent brocades adorned the seuoras who leant upon the arms&#xD;
of their dignified lords; while their bright-eyed daughters, -&#xD;
the handsome senoritas, in their hearts thanked the beautiful&#xD;
Empress for this gala occasion.&#xD;
In all these demonstrations, Maximilian and Carlotta read&#xD;

&#xD;
one welcome truth, that their presence gave pleasure to the in-&#xD;
habitants of Mexico; that the people were glad that they had&#xD;
come; and had faith and confidence in them.&#xD;
The pleasures of Puebla must be given over, however reluc-&#xD;
tantly, for the Emperor is needed at the capital, and he himself&#xD;
is impatient to begin the work he knows is before him. .&#xD;
The road leading from Puebla to the capital ascends, with a&#xD;
barely perceptible slope, for a distance of forty miles, to a&#xD;
beautiful table-land, from which, as far as the eye can reach,&#xD;
stretch out interminable fields of wheat and maize. Here and&#xD;
there a white hacienda is seen, half hidden ii. the deep foliage&#xD;
that surrounds it ; while, piled like cumulus clouds in the&#xD;
distance, are the two colossal guardians of the valley, Popocat-&#xD;
epetl, "the hill that smokes," and Iztac-cihuatl, "the white&#xD;
lady," the two belonging to the same range, put separated by&#xD;
a deep gap, that appears as a rift dividing the clouds. These&#xD;
giant sentinels lift up their hooded heads, covered with eternal&#xD;
snow, that gleams in the sunlight, while a thick, woody growth&#xD;
winds as a black belt about their base.&#xD;
The royal party passed over this table-land, enraptured with&#xD;
the beautiful views of Mexican scenery, that like the changes&#xD;
of a kaleidoscope, presented each moment a new feature, and&#xD;
soon came to the wild, picturesque region, kn. wn as the Black&#xD;
Forest. The road led them first'through dar some pines; now&#xD;
up a rocky height, along a narrow defile, on the edge of a pre-&#xD;
cipitous descent; terrors that were sufficient of themselves to&#xD;
frighten the timid heart, even without the knowledge that it&#xD;
was the great robber haunt of the country. Notwithstanding&#xD;
the strong guard of soldiers that accompanied he carriages, and&#xD;
without which even the public diligence never ventures, it was&#xD;
with a breath of relief that the ladies saw this forest in their&#xD;
rear, and found themselves approaching the country formerly&#xD;
covered by the waters of the lagunes, tha -surrounded the&#xD;
ancient city, and that, long since drained oW, have left a flat,'&#xD;
arid plain. .&#xD;
The destination,where they are next to stop, is the village of&#xD;
Guadalupe; where, at the celebrated temple o the Virgin, pre-&#xD;
parations have been made by the people for the celebration of&#xD;
the Grand Mass and Te Deum in honor of their sovereigns.&#xD;
From the capital, which was but a few leagues distant, a depu-&#xD;
tation of citizens had come out to meet them  and, long before&#xD;
the royal carriage approached the little vill ge, the sound of&#xD;
music was heard, and there was seen, winding along the plain,&#xD;
&#xD;
an imposing procession. Troops - of soldiers, glittering in&#xD;
gold-embroidered uniforms; horsemen dashing here and there,&#xD;
on fiery steeds, with Mexican saddles and silver stirrups, and&#xD;
the high boots embroidered or stamped in gold ;. carriages&#xD;
ornamented without, and within, filled with ladies in-their gay-&#xD;
est attire. Banners and pennons floated everywhere ;- and the,&#xD;
shouts of the multitude as the carriage that bore the Emperor&#xD;
and Empress approached, and the soldiers filed off and ranged&#xD;
themselves on either side, almost drowned the music of the fife-&#xD;
and drum. Their majesties were conducted to the Church of&#xD;
Guadalupe, dedicated to the Virgin, that protects the place ;&#xD;
and there, the Emperor answered the addresses delivered by the&#xD;
deputations, who in the name of the people bade them wel-&#xD;
come.&#xD;
Magnificent' preparations had been made for the entertain-&#xD;
ment of the sovereigns for the night; and it was not until the&#xD;
following day, June 12th, that the grand entrance into the&#xD;
capital was made. Everything there was ready. Triumphal&#xD;
arches, garlands, and festoons of flowers decked the houses; the&#xD;
streets were alive with equipages and horsemen, all vying&#xD;
with each other in their gorgeous adornings; and, falling in with&#xD;
the procession from Guadalupe, they increased the length and.&#xD;
splendor of the train, that, amid music and'cheers, and waving&#xD;
banners, made its way to the old Cathedral in the Grand Plaza;&#xD;
where, under a richly ornamented canopy, stood the Reverend&#xD;
Archbishop, waiting to greet them, and conduct them within&#xD;
the holy sanctuary. There was .scarcely a voice in that vast&#xD;
assemblage that crowded the Cathedral, that did not join in the&#xD;
Te Diurn, and the words of thanksgiving. There was no room&#xD;
for doubt in the Emperor's mind; everywhere his gaze fell&#xD;
upon some testimonial of love from his people. In the Cathe-&#xD;
dral, with its grand illuminations and decorations, were hung&#xD;
the ensigns of all the friendly powers, - France, Austria, and&#xD;
Belgium. As they turned to go out, above each door the&#xD;
Emperor saw his own portrait ; himself just as he stood now,&#xD;
in the uniform of a Mexican general, bearing upon his breast&#xD;
the insignia of the Order of Guadalupe.&#xD;
And now, beneath a magnificent canopy, and over the carpet-&#xD;
ing that has been spread across the Plaza, the Emperor and&#xD;
Empress and their train are conducted to the Imperial palace,&#xD;
at the entrance of which stands Marshal Bazaine, the French&#xD;
commander, surrounded by different officers, who wait to re-&#xD;
ceive them, and bid them welcome to their home.&#xD;

It was a strange, weird scene that the ,texican sun said&#xD;
"Good-night" to, on that June evening. Tl4e day had hardly&#xD;
gone out, when the grand illumination and display of fire-&#xD;
works began, and it was not until long past the midnight hour,&#xD;
that the quiet moon was allowed to assume hpr sway.&#xD;
It was with a sigh of intense relief that the young Empress&#xD;
found herself at last in her private room, wita her ladies, away&#xD;
from the crowd, that had thronged the palace since their arrival;&#xD;
and a cry of thankfulness escaped her lips, as she murmured&#xD;
her last midnight prayer, and begged that '"He who had pre-&#xD;
served them on sea and land,,-and had guicied them thus far,&#xD;
would still care for, and protect them in their new home."&#xD;
The convent bells tolled the hour of three ;in the .morning.&#xD;
The lights of the illumination had burned low, and had at last&#xD;
gone out in the windows, and the streets of the capital were&#xD;
wrapped in silence and darkness. Only now and then-a delin-&#xD;
quent soldier lounged out of'a caf6, and ma e his way as best&#xD;
he could through the quiet streets, towards his encampment.&#xD;
The figade of the grand Cathedral looked solemnly down&#xD;
upon the deserted Plaza; while the long gray front of the&#xD;
palace, the moonbeams silvering 'the towers that mounted&#xD;
either end, stretched out upon the eastern side.&#xD;
There, too, all was silent. Wearied with the fatigue of the&#xD;
journey and the excitement of the past week, all were glad to&#xD;
claim the rest, that nature sends in sleep-all, save one, whose&#xD;
soul was awkeful, and from whom repose seemed to flee. ' In&#xD;
the private cabinet, adjoining his apartments, sat the young&#xD;
Emperor of Mexico; and within his brain there were spirits at&#xD;
work, busy thoughts, going backward and forward, that forbade&#xD;
him to call up the power, that "knits up the ravelled sleeve of&#xD;
eare."&#xD;
This was his first night in his capital; and he saw now his,-&#xD;
future home. Everything was strange about him, and still he&#xD;
was at home. He looked up at the cross-timbers above, pol-&#xD;
ished and gilded after Mexican fashion ;. the. floor was inlaid&#xD;
with oak, and his eye rested at last upon the portraits hanging&#xD;
on the dark walls. There were the well-known faces of Fer-&#xD;
dinand and Isabella; and just opposite, was the Mexican-&#xD;
Montezuma, wearing the sad, sorrowful expression that never&#xD;
left his countenance, after he -found that he must yield his&#xD;
kingdom to the Spanish Cortez.&#xD;
The Emperor sat by the window, and looked out from time&#xD;
to time into the court-yard below, where a fountain threw out&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JTEWELS&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
its delicate spray, moistening the roots of a hugempianito tree&#xD;
growing near.&#xD;
Maximilian felt to-night the life, with its reality and its ear-&#xD;
nestness, crowding upon him too fast to. be put aside. The&#xD;
last month had done for him the work of years; had changed&#xD;
him from a free, untrammelled prince, to an anxious, thinking&#xD;
monarch.&#xD;
He turned his eye within, and it rested again upon the face&#xD;
of the old Emperor Montezuma. His mind ran back to the&#xD;
time when it was related of him, "that in an agony of despair&#xD;
at the Spaniards' approach, he shut himself up alone, and re-&#xD;
fused all consolation."  Montezuma, in all his glory, passed&#xD;
away, and so did his Spanish conquerors. One after another,&#xD;
the names of the Mexican rulers that had occupied this palace,&#xD;
now his home, built upon the site of the palace where, Cortez&#xD;
was received, came up, and one after another came to their&#xD;
untimely deaths. It was not a pleasant retrospection, and the&#xD;
Emperor sighed as he bade it pass. -The clock of the convent&#xD;
bell tolled the half-hour ; and still Maximilian sat there, his&#xD;
head leaning against the casement, and his eye fixed upon the&#xD;
Indian portrait. The lamp on the table within threw an in-&#xD;
distinct, weird light over the apartment. Gradually, as Maxi-&#xD;
milian gazed into the gloom of the far -corners of the apart-&#xD;
ment, they seemed to recede, and the dark walls were overhung&#xD;
with a rich tapestry, embroidered with gorgeous feather-work;&#xD;
the whole room was enveloped with a cloud of incense, rising&#xD;
from unseen censers, sending forth a soft, intoxicating odor.&#xD;
Maximilian gazed at the magic scene, breathless; when, sud-&#xD;
denly, before him he saw the figure of the Indian Emperor,&#xD;
his dark eyes wearing the same sorrowful expression, bent full&#xD;
upon him. A crimson tunic, richly bordered with feather-&#xD;
work; sandals embroidered with gold, and fastened with glit-&#xD;
tering clasps ; a low cap upon his head, with a coronal of&#xD;
flashing jewels in front, and the long green plume drooping&#xD;
behind ; a short, square cloak embroidered with gold, hanging&#xD;
over the right shoulder, completed his costume.&#xD;
Raising the sceptre, mounted with a Mexican eagle, he pointed&#xD;
towards the tapestry, and Maximilian heard his own name&#xD;
pronounced:&#xD;
"Maximilian, Prince of Austria! Dost thou come to the&#xD;
kingdom of Montezuma, to meet the curse that is upon it?&#xD;
Young Emperor, Montezuma fell before Cortez, and the Span-&#xD;
iards must likewise fall before Montezuma's people ! The&#xD;

promises of friendship, and black hearts, full of treachery&#xD;
within! -Montezuma's spirit pities thee ! Remember hum; and&#xD;
put not thy faith in promises ! "&#xD;
The Emperor was spell-bound. The incense was dissolving&#xD;
into vapor, the embroidered tapestry was gone, and where the&#xD;
spirit of the Indian Emperor stood, there was only, a .soft,&#xD;
indistinct halo. Maximilian started forward; the vision was&#xD;
gone, and he was awake ! The lamp had gone out. Faint&#xD;
streaks of light were creeping across the horizon, and the misty&#xD;
rays of the gray dawn were stealing in beside him.&#xD;
With a smile, he looked up at the Indian face that had&#xD;
calledjup.the dream of ancient days, but as he went out of the&#xD;
little cabinet to the inner chamber, he whispered again to his&#xD;
heart, " Montezuma's spirit pities thee ! Remember him; put&#xD;
not thy faith in promises !"&#xD;

LETTER from the capital, Inez ?" said Donna&#xD;
Anita, looking up from her book, as her niece entered&#xD;
her apartment, her face beaming with pleasure, while&#xD;
she held, in her hand a couple of letters.&#xD;
Yes, Pietro has just met the carrier going in to the city;&#xD;
he gave him a package for us, containing these ! One is for&#xD;
mine humble self; the other for you, and I am sure comes&#xD;
from Don Ruy. Will you hear Giulian's first?   He gives a&#xD;
grand account of our national affairs ; Mexico City is in an&#xD;
uproar of enthusiasm and joy over the arrival of the Emperor&#xD;
and Empress, and there has been a grand reception at the&#xD;
palace.'&#xD;
"If you please," said Anita,;interrupting Inez's spirited de-&#xD;
tail, "I will take Giulian's own account, giving you permis-&#xD;
sion, of course, to omit all personal messages to yourself."&#xD;
"How kind you are, dear Anita," laughed Inez, as she seated&#xD;
herself near her aunt, ." to request me so politely to carry out&#xD;
my own intentions ! But here we go, to be presented without&#xD;
&#xD;
further ceremony, to their august Majesties.&#xD;

&#xD;
Giulian gives&#xD;
&#xD;
"'The Emperor and Empress, with their Court, have at&#xD;
last arrived. It is useless to attempt a description of the en-&#xD;
thusiastic reception accorded to them  by the citizens of the&#xD;
capital; their way-from Vera Cruz here, was but a continuation&#xD;
of ovations and banquets. The grand procession of carriages,&#xD;
containing noble Dons, seioras, and senoritas; the long array&#xD;
of French and Mexican troops, with their full-dress uniforms,&#xD;
that went out to Guadalupe to meet their Majesties and escort&#xD;
them into the capital; the leperos, who for the nonce had thrown&#xD;
aside their rags, and in holiday attire, crowded the streets,-&#xD;
everything and every one was alive, heart, soul, and body jin-&#xD;
ing in the demonstrations. Imagine, if.you can, in the day, the&#xD;
gorgeous uniforms and nodding plumes of the soldiers, the gay&#xD;
equipages and glittering jewels of the seioras, the bright eyes of&#xD;
the seioritas peering through the flower-bedecked windows of the&#xD;
private dwellings at the throng that, without, rent the air with&#xD;
their shouts and vivas, as the royal procession passed on to&#xD;
the Cathedral.' And the scene in the Cathedral itself beggars&#xD;
description. The magnificent gothic pillars that support the&#xD;
nave were entwined with flags and garlands; the high altar at&#xD;
the extremity decorated with ornaments of gold and silver, and&#xD;
richly chased vases filled with flowers,; while the solid silver&#xD;
railing that enclosed the chancel,\gleamed with light, beneath&#xD;
the burning incense,&#xD;
"' As the Archbishop entered the Cathedral, and approached&#xD;
the altar where stood the other members of the clergy, and the&#xD;
Emperor and Empress followed, a glorious anthem, loud and&#xD;
exultant, was chanted by the choir above; and when the strains&#xD;
of the Te .Deurn began, the whole building shook with the im-&#xD;
mensity of sound that filled it.&#xD;
"'Would that you could have seen them! The Emperor in&#xD;
his magnificent Mexican uniform- the'stars and crosses of&#xD;
various orders glittering upon his breast; h proud, manly form,&#xD;
above the medium height; an open, handsome face, a deter-&#xD;
mined eye, and a proud air of conscious nobility, that hung&#xD;
about him even while he graciously returned the salutations as&#xD;
he passed out of the Cathedral, -all, seemed to elevate the man&#xD;
almost above the position, and carried the conviction that he&#xD;
had condescended, even in accepting a crown.&#xD;

the beautiful, accoinplislhed Empress! What words have I at&#xD;
my command, with which to. describe the perfection of grace&#xD;
and beauty?  Enough to say that she is the wife for our Em-&#xD;
peror Maximilian! One cannot look into her face, youthful&#xD;
and fresh as it is, without reading an energy and determination,&#xD;
of spirit, that are the necessary attributes of a fine character;&#xD;
and yet, over the whole countenance, in the personal- deport-&#xD;
ment, there is a soft expression of sweetness that wins one to&#xD;
admiration and love. After the ceremonies were ended in the&#xD;
Cathedral, as she passed out, leaning upon the arm of the Em-&#xD;
peror, she called.forth the vivas from the multitude waiting,&#xD;
as she bowed and smiled graciously at the crowd of lperos&#xD;
that had pressed up to see her. All this has-been two weeks&#xD;
ago, and even yet, the illuminations and festivities are nightly&#xD;
kept up. Ah! Inez, the people and every one feel-- and,&#xD;
therefore, cannot cease rejoicing - that Mexico has at last a&#xD;
ruler worthy to reign over her !&#xD;
' Last night there was a grand reception at the National&#xD;
Palace. The Emperor has been holding official meetings every&#xD;
day, and each afternoon there is a review of troops ; but this&#xD;
reception was a gathering of the nobility, of the citizens, and&#xD;
the officers of the army stationed about the capital. Every-&#xD;
thing was conducted with European magnificence. The Em-&#xD;
press Carlotta, as she is called, was attended by the maids of&#xD;
honor, who have accompanied her from Europe ; while the, Em-&#xD;
peror at her side was surrounded by the members of his staff&#xD;
and household. They are so, democratic in their manners, so&#xD;
full of gracious affability, that one forgets in meeting and con-&#xD;
versing with them that they are to be addressed by that formal&#xD;
title, "Your Majesty."   -&#xD;
I have met and am fast becoming a firm friend to a young&#xD;
nobleman, Count Victor Isolani, who has been with the Em-&#xD;
peror in the navy of Austria since boyhood, and has now come&#xD;
over with him to Mexico. He is from the Tyrol; and is a per-&#xD;
fect type of a gentleman and scholar. We meet every afternoon&#xD;
when we go down to the Alameda, which you know is our&#xD;
park, filled with long avenues of trees, and musical with the&#xD;
plash of fountains. Being the fashionable resort, it is each&#xD;
evening filled with equipages and gay parties, riding or walk-&#xD;
ing, who come out to hear the band belonging to a French&#xD;
regiment play.&#xD;
'The military has not yet undergone a reorganization, but&#xD;
I shall doubtless obtain a position-in a regiment known as the&#xD;
&#xD;
" Empress's Guards," the command of which is to be given to&#xD;
Col. Miguel Lopez, an officer (Mexican) whom the Emperor&#xD;
seems to esteem most highly.&#xD;
"' I close my journal letter, with the earnest petition that&#xD;
Anita and yourself shall come to the capital. I know it would&#xD;
be best, and certainly pleasanter, for me. Don Ruy sends his&#xD;
letter to Anita with this. And now to you, querid4mid, I send&#xD;
the best love of my heart.' "&#xD;
" But I am treading upon forbidden groundaAnita," said&#xD;
Inez stopping and smiling while she closed the letter. "'Now&#xD;
isn't it a new era, an array of pomp and splendor for poor,&#xD;
broken-hearted Mexico ? How I should have enjoyed seeing it;&#xD;
wouldn't you, Anita ? But we have forgotten your letter fro&#xD;
Don Ruy!" and she threw it to her aunt, as she rose to leav .&#xD;
"Stay, Inez I Read this, too, aloud," said Afiita, breaking&#xD;
the seal with its elaborate crest.&#xD;
" Short, certainly," said Inez, as she began its reading; "but&#xD;
Don Ruy never deals in superfluities ! He always speaks to&#xD;
the point."&#xD;
"' ANITA : - I write simply to express to you -the unabated&#xD;
interest I feel in the welfare of my brother's family ; and to&#xD;
urge upon you, for-your greater comfort and safety, the neces-&#xD;
sity of a residence in the capital, or within the limits of ,some&#xD;
city protected by a garrison-at least during the next year, or&#xD;
until our new government, which every one 'thinks will prosper&#xD;
under the rule of the gracious young Emperor, is 'firmly es-&#xD;
tablished. Let me insist that Inez and yourself come at once&#xD;
to my home, and consider it your own as long as you find it&#xD;
agreeable. Though I am only a crusty old man myself, yet&#xD;
Giulian can, I think, make it pleasant for Inez ; and we all&#xD;
together may drive away some of the loneliness and gloom from&#xD;
the old house. I shall expect you in the early autumn. Don't&#xD;
delay later than October; you can leave Pietro in charge where&#xD;
you are, with all safety.&#xD;

'Ah,. Anita, we shall go now, shan't we? " cried Inez, as&#xD;
she closed the letter. " How like Don luy, to be so kind and&#xD;
considerate !"&#xD;

mode of life, and facing the excitement that I know we shall&#xD;
meet in the capital. I think we should be just as safe here,&#xD;
with General Meija so near, as in the capital."&#xD;
"Ah, Aiita! you have forgotten the days of your own&#xD;
youth ! How often have I heard my father tell of the Spanish&#xD;
cavaliers, who swore allegiance to the beautiful Senorita Anita,&#xD;
the belle of Madrid ! And I do believe, Afnita, that your&#xD;
heart has never left Spain! , I expect some cross old Spanish&#xD;
nobleman is laying the sins of his bachelor life at your&#xD;
door !"&#xD;
" No, no ! nothing of that, Inez! My heart, it is true, still'&#xD;
clings to Spain and our beautiful home near Madrid, and I&#xD;
have a great longing that you should see it ; but all is doubt-&#xD;
less much changed now, and we should find my brother, who&#xD;
was in the prime of life when we left, an old man. You know&#xD;
it has been twenty years since we came to Mexico, your dear&#xD;
mother and I",&#xD;
"And she has been dead how long?"&#xD;
"Just eighteen years last May. She was more a daughter&#xD;
than a sister to me; for I was ten years ier senior, and our&#xD;
mother was taken from us when she was scarcely out of short.&#xD;
frocks. Well," continued Anita, brushing aside a tear, 4"we&#xD;
must write to your uncle, and tell him we shall be with him in&#xD;
October.''&#xD;
" Dear, Anita'!" said Inez, softly, as. she threw her arms&#xD;
affectionately about her, and kissed her warmly. "You make&#xD;
this sacrifice for me ! How shall I ever repay your kindness&#xD;
and devotion - my own second mother ! "&#xD;
Inez left the room, and Anita opened her book again. It&#xD;
was an elegantly bound copy of ancient Moorish ,and Spanish&#xD;
Ballads," filled with legends of the Cid, - the lamentations and&#xD;
penitence of Don Rhoderick, and the chivalry of the great old&#xD;
chieftain, Bernardo del Carpio.&#xD;
. Anita endeavored in vain to fix her mind upon the page&#xD;
before her. The words that Inez had so lightly spoken had&#xD;
awakened deep echoes in her soul, and her heart was softly&#xD;
pleading for one hour with the past. Yes ! Well did Anita&#xD;
remember those courtly days at Madrid, when knightly cav-&#xD;
aliers had acknowledged her charms, and'sung her beauty in&#xD;
magic strains of love and praise ; and too w11 did she recall'&#xD;
the coming of the one, at the sound of whos voice her heart&#xD;
had thrillingly and silently acknowledged its kng. The proud,&#xD;
manly form of Don Juan Gonzales was again before her,, as she&#xD;
&#xD;
had seen him first. He had come from over the seas to revisit&#xD;
the home of his nativity, and he found at Madrid, a charm that&#xD;
made him linger. But it was not Aiita's glance that held him&#xD;
bound: the soft blue depths of another's eye placed -a stronger&#xD;
spell upon him. The struggle in An-ita's heart was not the less&#xD;
severe in its silent working, that the favored one was her own&#xD;
sister - that it was the tender, timid Marina that had. capti-&#xD;
vated his heart ; and it was but a poor return that she was&#xD;
called the most brilliant woman at the Spanish Court. No one&#xD;
dreamed of the heart-misery that made the gayeties of life but a&#xD;
solemn mockery, full of vanity and emptiness.&#xD;
"It was all past, long ago," thought Auita, as she recalled it&#xD;
now. Long, long years had rolled since she had woven the&#xD;
orange wreath, and had imprinted the bridal kiss upon the&#xD;
brow of the younger sister, and had uttered the death-knell of&#xD;
her hopes, " my brother," to the one unconscious of her love.&#xD;
Aye, it was but a memory now - those long-ago hours of sol-&#xD;
itary anguish, when in her own chamber she had striven and&#xD;
prayed for the mastery over her heart, for strength. to cast&#xD;
out a love - a hopeless love, that 'twas a sin to cherish. And&#xD;
God had given her the victory. Time had shown a, true, holy.&#xD;
record for Anita.  She -had put all selfishness out of her&#xD;
nature, and had yielded to the pleadings of her gentle sister, and&#xD;
had come with her to her new home; and God had given her&#xD;
here a work to do. She had proven faithful to her dead sister's&#xD;
trust, and had brought the helpless babe from infancy to wo-&#xD;
manhood ; and, through all the long years of her life in Mexico,&#xD;
had never betrayed one chapter of her sad heart-history. Don&#xD;
Juan Gonzales slept now beside his young wife, and she was&#xD;
the sole guardian of his child; and she would prove true to her,&#xD;
as long as life lasted.&#xD;
Anita passed her hand gently over her brow. Let it all be&#xD;
forgotten! -These memories were wrapped in .their winding-&#xD;
sheet, and buried in the past, and -why disentomb them now?&#xD;
No, no;. cover up again, and forever, their white, ghastly&#xD;
faces! .&#xD;
She unclosed again her book. By some strange. chance her&#xD;
eye rested upon the quaint old ballad, "The Bridal of An-.&#xD;
dalla."  How often in her youth she 'had sung the sad words&#xD;
to the accompaniment of the lute, and softly and touchingly&#xD;
now, chiming well with the- tenderness of her heart to-night,&#xD;
she read the verses over, droppig, now and then, a tear of&#xD;
sympathy for sorrow so like what her own had been.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
HE Emperor Maximilian, now tha ' he was in his&#xD;
capital, proclaimed and acknowled ed head of the&#xD;
Empire by the seemingly unanimous voice of the peo-&#xD;
ple, was impatient to have done wit festivities and&#xD;
gayeties that kept him     from   giving his time      nd attention at&#xD;
once to the duties before him.        Duties!    Th y were manifold&#xD;
as the stars of heaven; and no man could bett r appreciate and&#xD;
understand their imperative nature, and the d licate diplomacy&#xD;
necessary for their satisfactory discharge, than Maximilian.&#xD;
He knew that, amid" all the shouting and cheering that had&#xD;
greeted them in Mexico, there were secret e emies, who were&#xD;
watching closely to discover ",who the man            as " with which&#xD;
the Republican cause must war. He knew th t while the cities&#xD;
were wild with admiration and praise of thei new            sovereigns,&#xD;
that back amid the northern hills there w re men plotting&#xD;
their destruction.     And yet, prompted with         'laudable desire&#xD;
to rule over a -united people, Maximilian's fi st proclamation&#xD;
was to grant a general amnesty, and           pardo    to all political&#xD;
offenders, and to send to Juarez the olive bra ch of peace, in-&#xD;
viting, nay, urging not only him, but all the          epublican lead-&#xD;
ers, to  a   conference with    himself and     his    inisters at the&#xD;
capital, that they might together freely disc ss the speediest&#xD;
and surest plan for securing a permanent peace to the country.&#xD;
But in this, Maximilian had mistaken his man. He did not&#xD;
&#xD;
understand the obstinate doggedness of the Indian spirit of&#xD;
Benito Juarez ; and he was, therefore, not altogether prepared&#xD;
for the contemptuous refusal with which his conciliatory mes-&#xD;
sage was returned.&#xD;
Juarez felt, perhaps, that it '.was better to reign in hell&#xD;
than to serve in heaven;" and though he had been forced to&#xD;
retire before the French forces, almost to the banks of the&#xD;
Rio Grande, and there was not a State that he could call his&#xD;
own ; though his army was. scattered here and there, and was&#xD;
rapidly becoming disorganized and disbanded, in spite of the&#xD;
efforts of the Liberal generals to keep their forces together; -yet&#xD;
he felt that the same Fortune that had first made him a Gov-&#xD;
ernor in Mexico, had then banished, and again recalled him to&#xD;
be the chief ruler, would not desert him now forever; and&#xD;
so he held fast to his title of President, and would not consent&#xD;
to be " even the second man in Rome."  "And as for the high&#xD;
carnival the fickle people were holding in the cities of his Re-&#xD;
public, every breeze that wafted the echoes of it to him, only&#xD;
fanned the fires of hate, burning in his soul. Let them take care&#xD;
that he did not make it for them, indeed, the prelude to a season&#xD;
of Lent!&#xD;
Nothing daunted by his failure to overcome 'the prejudices&#xD;
of the Republicans, Maximilian turned his attention with en-&#xD;
ergy to the affairs of his kingdom. After the selection of his&#xD;
ministers, and the organization of' his cabinet, there came the&#xD;
public debt to be considered; the appointment of foreign min-&#xD;
isters, the adoption of a national flag, and all the innumerable&#xD;
points that must be settled at the beginning of a new regime.&#xD;
Perhaps no monarch in the. record of history, - certainly, not&#xD;
one so young, ever found himself assuming a position as chief&#xD;
ruler, where so many seemingly impossible difficulties were to&#xD;
be reconciled. They confronted him with Hydra heads; and it&#xD;
required no ordinary courage to meet them.&#xD;
First, there was the insurgent or -Liberal party, which he&#xD;
had hoped to .win to him by. offers of peace, and a firm, impar-&#xD;
tial administration. In this, he failed at the outset.&#xD;
Antagonistic to the Liberals, in favor .of the Empire, or,&#xD;
rather of themselves, was the Church party, which hoped to&#xD;
obtain from the, new Emperor the confiscated property that.&#xD;
they had lost during the past ten years. Maximilian's promise&#xD;
to Pope Pius, to sustain the Catholic religion, and to, protect&#xD;
the Church in his kingdom, had been interpreted ~as a virtual&#xD;
guarantee to restore their gr'operty; but as much. of it had&#xD;

&#xD;
fallen' into individual hands, the Emperor saw  t once that he&#xD;
would only sow a fresh elements of strife and discord, to at-&#xD;
tempt to take it from one for the other ; and s here began a&#xD;
trouble for the future. Again, there were the  rench claims&#xD;
staring him in the face, the first instalment of hich would be&#xD;
urged upon him for payment; and as he found the Mexican&#xD;
treasury with its revenue, not sufficient to  over national&#xD;
expenses, something must be done at once to change it, or there&#xD;
would be an awkward situation there.&#xD;
And there, too, were the French troops, whi  were at the&#xD;
command of. Marshal Bazaine, who seemed, at first, anxious&#xD;
to aid the Emperor inany plan he set on foot; and in the&#xD;
autumn the Austrian and Belgian troops would arrive. They,&#xD;
too, were to be controlled by Ministers of tleir respective&#xD;
countries, with whom the Emperor was to conult in dispos-&#xD;
ing of them. It was only the native Mexican soldiers that had&#xD;
been enlisted, over which the Emperor had entire and full com-&#xD;
mand; and he found it no easy matter to organize and harmo-&#xD;
nize, under one banner, so many different elements; and to pro-&#xD;
duce in them such unity of sentiment, that they should feel&#xD;
equal devotion to the country for which they fought.&#xD;
But Maximilian, in his large, generous heart, egadf his work&#xD;
in earnest. He came to Mexico, determined t raise her up,&#xD;
without sparing himself, and his resolution could not be&#xD;
shaken. Full of spirit and energy, he trod down the difficulties&#xD;
before him as "he would the heaving frost-lands of winter."&#xD;
His first movement outside of the capital was o make a tour&#xD;
on horseback, with his staff and ministers, through the different&#xD;
States, in order to become personally known t his subjects,&#xD;
and to inform himself as to their wants and necessities. He&#xD;
also endeavored to discover the resources of every portion of&#xD;
his kingdom, in order that he might begin at once to forward&#xD;
their development': for he knew that Mexico must trust to&#xD;
herself; and knew, too, that she had within he own bosom,&#xD;
treasures sufficient to free herself from 'all outside responsibili-&#xD;
ties.&#xD;
Seeing that the enterprise and energy of the  exican people&#xD;
was not sufficient to carry out his plans, without having infused&#xD;
into it a working element, and desirous of secu being immigra-&#xD;
tion, he returned to his capital, and made most liberal offers of&#xD;
land and protection, to those Who would seek  home in his&#xD;
Empire.&#xD;
The beautiful tierra&amp;amp; caliente, lying in luxurious idleness, its&#xD;
&#xD;
iich harvest wasting for want of laborers! Mexico needed&#xD;
settlers; bold, enterprising men, who would do their part to&#xD;
give her railroads and telegraphs; to establish agricultural and&#xD;
industrial enterprises; factories, banks, and all those national&#xD;
institutions that build up a nation in greatness, and increase&#xD;
it in wealth. And, too, the Emperor felt, by employing the&#xD;
minds of his subje'ets and directing their attention to lucrative&#xD;
pursuits, and showing them the blessings of a prosperous peace,&#xD;
they would be less ready to sound the tocsin of war.&#xD;
Everywhere the Emperor went, he was greeted with enthu-&#xD;
siasm; and everywhere he left some testimonial of his bounty.&#xD;
While he was endeavoring to draw the attention of the capital-&#xD;
ists of the Old World to this new field 'for speculation, and to&#xD;
induce them to invest in- his Empire; while he was growing&#xD;
rapidly into increased popularity by his untiring devotion to&#xD;
his kingdom, the young Empress did not remain idle. Accus-&#xD;
tomed from her childhood to matters of state, and her own:&#xD;
judgment being strengthened by self-reliance, a principle which&#xD;
her royal father had instilled into her, Carlotta was notjwant-&#xD;
ing in the power to sustain. her duties as an Empress, but was&#xD;
indeed a help-mate, and co-worker with her husband.&#xD;
She took first upon herself the task of alleviating the suffer-&#xD;
ings of, and elevating, the lower classes in the capital, where&#xD;
she found the larger portion of the inhabitants belonging to the&#xD;
despised l6pergs, and living by a degrading system of street beg-&#xD;
gary.&#xD;
First, she determined there must be labor provided for those&#xD;
who could earn their living, and they must be taught to work;&#xD;
but for the aged and infirm she established hospitals, under the&#xD;
charge of suitable wardens, where their declining years might&#xD;
be spent, unchilled by the frosts of poverty, want, and dis-&#xD;
tress.&#xD;
She also provided for the children, by establishing free&#xD;
schools, where the poor were always welcome to the teachings;&#xD;
for Carlotta well knew that education is the handmaiden of&#xD;
civilization. All of these charitable institutions were under&#xD;
her especial care and patronage, and the funds necessary for&#xD;
their support were furnished from her own private purse ; and&#xD;
as she gave it, the pure offering of her heart, to her people, she&#xD;
did not withhold from them her presence ; but from time to&#xD;
time visited, them, and always inspected the reports sent in, of&#xD;
their condition, herself.&#xD;

lower classes,. Carlotta did not forget her duty s the head of&#xD;
the Court circle.&#xD;
She endeavored, at the receptions which wer held weekly&#xD;
at the palace, to give a high tone, an intellect al and moral&#xD;
turn to the minds of the guests, and by her ow  example, her&#xD;
fine musical and artistic talent, sought to inspir in the ladies&#xD;
of the Court circle, a desire to attain. perfection ' these accom-&#xD;
plishments. As she desired no germ of talent to remain latent&#xD;
in the Empire, wherever it was discovered, it was t once favored&#xD;
with royal patronage.&#xD;
And so the young Empire began its growth.   ministers were&#xD;
received and accredited from foreign Courts;- consuls were&#xD;
established; courts of justice inaugurated: not ' g was neg-&#xD;
lected that could insure safety for the future. he coming of&#xD;
the Emperor seemed to have broken the heart f the Juarez&#xD;
faction, and in a military point the Empire was q et, save now&#xD;
and then a clash, at the farthest outposts, betwee the garrison&#xD;
and some marauding band of Liberals.&#xD;
Though everything seemed to promise fair, yet Maximilian&#xD;
was restlessly ambitious in his impatient zeal .t increase his&#xD;
strength and power. He desired to see every   itizen of his.&#xD;
Empire a Briareus, to work and accomplish good  r the nation.&#xD;
A gallant ship has put to sea; well built and strong she&#xD;
seems, and manned with sailors brave and true weighted with&#xD;
the hopes of a nation, she rides peacefully over. the quiet&#xD;
waves. God speed her with fair weather and propitious winds !&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
NOVEMBER evening; beautifully clea and starlit,&#xD;
with that peculiar brilliancy of the he vens that is&#xD;
seen only in tropical climates.-&#xD;
It is a fete night at the palace. The  ustrian and&#xD;
Belgian corps have arrived, and this celebration is in their&#xD;
honor. The great reception-room, or Iturbide saloon, is fitted&#xD;
up with unusual adornments and decorations. From the&#xD;
gilded cross-timbers of the ceiling, hang at intervals the im-&#xD;
mense candelabras, bearing up their blazing circles of light.-&#xD;
The faces of the dark portraits on the wall, fron that of the&#xD;

&#xD;
noble Washington, to those of Hidalgo and Morelos, seem to&#xD;
breathe with life, as they watch the coming in of the vast&#xD;
assembly; the seuoras, senoritas, and their escorts, who are fill-.&#xD;
assethe length and breadth of the room.&#xD;
i   Without, on the Grand Plaza, the magnificent Austrian band,&#xD;
belonging to a regiment but recently arrived, is playing the&#xD;
national airs of the different countries, Mexico, France, Aus-&#xD;
triaand 3lgium; while within, all is life and animation. Not&#xD;
only the gr4nd reception-room, but the saloon, with its couchant.,&#xD;
lions watching at the entrance ; the audience chamber, with its&#xD;
walls of crimson damask, bearing in golden embroidery the&#xD;
Mexican eagle, and the motto, "Equity in justice," - all are&#xD;
rapidly filling with maidens, flashing with family jewels a cen-&#xD;
tury old, and French, Austrian, and Mexican officers, to whom&#xD;
the scene, is not less agreeable than novel.&#xD;
It was with feverish impatience that Inez Gonzales made her&#xD;
toilette to-night. The coming of Afuita and herself to the capi-&#xD;
tal, had been delayed a month later than the time at first pro-&#xD;
sed; and it was only a week since they reached her uncle's,&#xD;
Don Ruy Gonzales, who lived in princely style on the Calle&#xD;
de -&#xD;
But now Inez had realized her dreams. She was in the&#xD;
city of Mexico the world to her ; and to-night she was to be&#xD;
presented to the Empress, the beautiful, accomplished Empress!&#xD;
What a change from her quiet, uneventful life1.&#xD;
It was w' h no small degree of triumph that she surveyed&#xD;
herself, tout ensemble, before the long mirror of the drawing-&#xD;
room, where she awaited Giulian's coming ; not that she had&#xD;
more vanity than her sex in general, but then, to-night Aiiita&#xD;
and herself had exhausted their taste and ingenuity, that she&#xD;
should make a favorable impression, and a successful debit in&#xD;
society; and Afiita was not over-partial in her judgment when&#xD;
she exclaimed, as she lovingly clasped the last jewel on her,&#xD;
Well Inez, I don't think you could be improved!"&#xD;
Her dress was perhaps a little antique for one so young ; for&#xD;
Anita had brought out all of her own and her mother's jewels,&#xD;
and had selected a set of handsome diamonds for the evening&#xD;
wear. A splendid crimson brocade swept .in ample folds to&#xD;
a long train behind; and over the beautifully rounded arms&#xD;
was a fall of rich black lace, caught at the shoulder with a dia-&#xD;
mond clasp. An aigrette of the same flashing gem held a crim-&#xD;
son camelia in the waves of the dark hair. And the face itself!&#xD;
A broad, full brow; dark, soul-lit eyes; an exquisitely shaped&#xD;

mouth; a perfect ideal of Spanish beauty!  .heighten the&#xD;
poetic picture, Auita had begged to fasten in h r hair, the long&#xD;
Spanish veil embroidered with golden threads..&#xD;
Anita had gone out, and left her alone in the drawing-room,&#xD;
and Inez stood there in all the beauty of woman ood, regarding&#xD;
herself, perhaps, with a little tinge of vanity.&#xD;
She stood, there to-night, a cultivated, accom lished woman;&#xD;
yet knowing naught of the world's good or ill, t e world's trust&#xD;
or the world's treachery. She'was on the thre hold; to-night&#xD;
the magic boundary would be passed: a -new st r would shine&#xD;
upon her future ; a new light would be thrown o the scenes of&#xD;
her life.&#xD;
There was a step behind her, and a voice hulf whispered,&#xD;
"Not less an empress of beauty, though uncrowed !"&#xD;
" Giulian ! " she exclaimed, starting, and turnin to her lover,&#xD;
who stood regarding her with a smile of admirat on. In a mo-&#xD;
ment it died into almost a shadow of regret.,&#xD;
" What is it, Giulian ? " said Inez anxiously, a she noted the&#xD;
change that swept over his features. " Do I- no please you?&#xD;
Am I at fault in my dress?"&#xD;
" Please me, my Queen! No, no, Inez ! I dread-but perhaps&#xD;
I ought not to tell you - but do you know, that since the time&#xD;
has come, I half-way dread to take my beautiful flower, with&#xD;
the dew still upon it, to this gay Court, where there will be&#xD;
so many that are false and untrue."&#xD;
" But what have they, Giulian, to do with me. I am going&#xD;
to see the Emperor and Empress, and care not  thought for&#xD;
others ! It would be nothing to me if there was no -one there&#xD;
save ourselves, except Count Isolani, your frien . I want to&#xD;
know him. I need not mistrust him; need I, Giulian ?  Is he&#xD;
not good and true'?"&#xD;
"Yes, Inez," cried Giulian, with a strange twinge of pain in&#xD;
his heart as he remembered Isolani's handsome face, and courtly&#xD;
bearing, "he is good and true, and I want him to be your&#xD;
friend. But, my own," he added, seizing her hand and draw-&#xD;
ing her nearer, "promise me again to-night,-as you did at&#xD;
Querataro - promise me that you will never forsal e me for an-&#xD;
other, that you will love me unto death?"&#xD;
There was a passionate earnestness in his voice, an intensity&#xD;
of feeling, that for the, moment almost startled Inez.&#xD;
"Giulian," said she, reproachfully, " whom have ![ to love but&#xD;
you? You have my promise sacredly given; will you not trust&#xD;
me to keep it ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JTEWELS.&#xD;

&#xD;
She looked into his eyes, and saw there the sudden gleam&#xD;
of light that leaped into their blue depths, and she knew that&#xD;
he believed her to .be honest and true -and knew before he&#xD;
spoke that he trusted her forever.&#xD;
"Inez, God bless you! I shall never again doubt you. Come!&#xD;
let us go ! I want them to see you at the palace; and I would not&#xD;
take from you one moment of the pleasure ,and happiness that&#xD;
I trust is before you."  They left the room, and descending,&#xD;
entered the carriage that was waiting in the Court-yard below,&#xD;
and were soon on their way to the "Grand Plaza."&#xD;
" Ah ! aregal Spanish beauty Navarro has there ! ".exclaimed&#xD;
a young French officer near the doorway, as Inez entered the&#xD;
drawing-room of the palace, an half-hour later, leaning on Giu-&#xD;
lian's arm. "Who is she ? do you know? " continued the speaker&#xD;
in a whisper, to his companion, a bright-eyed Mexican beauty.&#xD;
" Something new, n'est-ce pas ?: I have not seen her at Court&#xD;
before. His sister, I trust ! always liked Navarro,.noble fellow ;&#xD;
we must be presented ! "&#xD;
The little maiden did not seem to relish the officer's sudden&#xD;
admiration of this new star, that seemed to threaten an eclipse&#xD;
of her own ; and so, with real gravity, she confessed her ignor-&#xD;
ance of the new-comer's name and rank.&#xD;
" She may be, however," she added upon second thought, her&#xD;
face brightening perceptibly, " Segorita Gonzales, from. Quera-&#xD;
taro, recently arrived at the capital. This is her d&amp;amp;but, I guess;&#xD;
and she is, you know," with vindictive pleasure, "Captain Na-&#xD;
varro'sfiancse /"&#xD;
" Piancse 1Mon .Dieu!" cried the officer, with a comic ex-&#xD;
pression of despair ; "my heart is broken ! Mademoiselle," with&#xD;
piteous pleading in his voice, "will you not in charity bind&#xD;
it up?"&#xD;
" No, no," cried the girl, laughingly ; 4"I am afraid it might be&#xD;
a bad job!  You have said I was something of an iconoclast&#xD;
myself, and might give you further trouble !"&#xD;
" Alas, then I am indeed undone ! I must leave the capital.&#xD;
I've had nothing but trouble from these wicked senoritas since&#xD;
I came. I must go back to Puebla, or to my command at Puces&#xD;
or I shall, be ruined; so that even one of our Paris jewels will&#xD;
never be able to restore me to health and spirits !"&#xD;
" And are there, then, no maidens in Puebla, who will accept&#xD;
the kind office of 'La Sour Seraphe,' and care for this poor&#xD;
soldier with his wounded heart?"&#xD;
"'Mademoiselle ! forbear, 8'il vous plat / You only make me&#xD;

rof beatification, where these maidenly beguilers and tempters&#xD;
ire forbidden to come ! "&#xD;
"Horrible, Count La Croix; you are growing heathenish !&#xD;
Cry out, 'Peccavi!' 'or I'll have you banished from the capital&#xD;
before three days have passed !'"&#xD;
" A compromise," whispered the Count, and his words&#xD;
brought a conscious blush to the cheek of his companion: "place&#xD;
yourself under the ban, too, and give us' the same exile, and I&#xD;
will never seek to be released. A la dispicion da V. /"&#xD;
In the meantime - Giulian had passed through the grand&#xD;
saloon, presenting Inez to various friends he met, until, by a&#xD;
side-door, they entered the audience-chamber, and awaited the&#xD;
coming of the Emperor and Empress. The room was nearly&#xD;
filled with the members of the cabinet, the foreign ministers,&#xD;
the higher municipal officers, and their wives.&#xD;
'The Austrian band was now within the palace, and had begun&#xD;
the magnificent air of national liberty, that heralded the royal&#xD;
coming:&#xD;
With curious, eager interest Inez watched the Emperor and&#xD;
Empress, as they entered, and, followed by their train, passed&#xD;
through the open space left by the guests to the dais in the rear&#xD;
of the apartment...&#xD;
The Emperor, tall, handsome, and erect, wore the Imperial&#xD;
uniform, and his earnest face was lit up by a smile of gratified&#xD;
pleasure at the repeated whispers of "Vive l'Empereur" that&#xD;
greeted him as he passed. The Empress Carlotta leaned upon&#xD;
his arm, and the delicate azure hue of her dress heightened&#xD;
the beauty of her lovely face; her distinguish bearing, her. ele--&#xD;
gant toilette, and her winning manner, as she bowed to those on&#xD;
either side, drew all eyes in admiration to her. On the dais,&#xD;
with its beautifully embroidered crimson hangings, looped back&#xD;
with golden tassels, were two chairs of state, to be occupied by&#xD;
the Emperor and Empress, while about them stood first the&#xD;
Empress's-maids of honor, and then the members of the diplo-&#xD;
matic corps.&#xD;
Near the Emperor was Marslhal Bazaine, and by his side&#xD;
Col. Lopez, who had recently been honored with the appointment.&#xD;
of commander of the "Empress's Regiment." There was Count&#xD;
1 Thun, and near him Count Isolani and Count Khevenhuil-&#xD;
ber, who, true to his promise, had cast his future with the Em-&#xD;
peror Maximilian, In the other persons throughout the room&#xD;
there was a rare .union of beauty wit, and grace. The ladies&#xD;

of Mexico are not surpassed in magnificence of dress by those&#xD;
of any country, and diamonds and pearls are seen to-night in&#xD;
lavish profusion; for a Mexican lady of any pretension what-&#xD;
ever, is considered poor indeed if she be without jewels, and&#xD;
will submit to any privation rather than give up her dia-&#xD;
monds.&#xD;
Inez waited with impatience, while General Almonte,pre-&#xD;
sented various others 'to their Majesties, and her heart bounded&#xD;
as Giulian led her forward, and she heard her own name pro-&#xD;
nounced.&#xD;
"-Senorita Gonzales?" said the Emperor smiling,' "we have&#xD;
heard of La Senorita often before, through our good officer here,&#xD;
Captain Navarro."&#xD;
" And Senorita Gonzales is welcome to our Court," said.&#xD;
the Empress, extending her hand, while she regarded the girl&#xD;
with admiration. " Captain Navarro, we must thank you for&#xD;
giving us such a jewel. You have but just arrived, seno-&#xD;
rita ?"&#xD;
" One week ago, your Miajesty; and things are rather new&#xD;
to me, yet."&#xD;
" Ah! we will not let you pine for the home at Querataro;&#xD;
you must remain with us for a long time."&#xD;
"Ah!" said the Emperor, "I am determined Senorita Gon-&#xD;
zales shall be guarded against ennui and discontent ; for I am&#xD;
going to provide her with two trusty guardians; to keep her&#xD;
secure," glancing at Captain Navarro, and at Count Isolani,&#xD;
who was a silent but interested liatener. "In one of these&#xD;
knights you already have confidence; and. now let me present&#xD;
the other - Count Victor Isolani! Both Captain Navarro&#xD;
and myself do vouch for him. Will you accept these gentle-&#xD;
men, sefyorita, as your stanch defenders and guardians?"&#xD;
" I do accept them, Sire," said Inez blushngly, but catching&#xD;
the Emperor's playful manner, "but only with your Majestysa&#xD;
endorsement; for I am afraid, however true nd-devoted they&#xD;
may be to your Majesty, to me they wil tyrove knights&#xD;
errant."&#xD;
"No, no, seforita," said the Empress; "we do only make them&#xD;
better' officers and soldiers, if 'possible ; for they will never&#xD;
leave the capital now; for-where the treasure isthehere the&#xD;
heart is also."&#xD;
"With your Majesty's -permission," said Count Isolani, pifer&#xD;

pleasures - of my trust at once ; and with the senorita's con-&#xD;
sent, will conduct her to the music-room."&#xD;
if",But remember, good comrade," said Giulian aside, as they&#xD;
passed him, "you are on duty-only one half hour, at the end of&#xD;
which time you shall be relieved by the second watch."&#xD;
They turned to a small room, beautifully fitted up, between&#xD;
the reception-room and the audience-chamber, which was now&#xD;
almost deserted. They stopped near the doorway.&#xD;
"1I shall begin to fear, from the seuiorita's silence," said&#xD;
Count Isolani,- "that she is not over-pleased, and has scarcely&#xD;
confidence in one of his Majesty's appointments."&#xD;
" No, no! " cried Inez, "you must credit everything to-night,&#xD;
that you do not find agreeable in your patron-lady, to inexper-&#xD;
ience; for, you know, this is my debt, not only in Court-life,&#xD;
but in society itself."&#xD;
" Yes," said the Count, "Captain Navarro,-Giulian, I have&#xD;
learned to call him-has told me all about you, and your home&#xD;
at Querataro, and has made me long to meet you, as though&#xD;
you, too, were a friend: we shall be such, I trust. But shall I be&#xD;
so selfish now," he continued, as he stood in the doorway, " as to&#xD;
deny the pleasure of presentation to these young officers," half&#xD;
motioning to a group of gentlemen near, " who have been giv-&#xD;
ing me all manner of signs to that effect ?  If I do, I shall&#xD;
receive their anathemas to-morrow. But see," he exclaimed, as&#xD;
they looked behind~ and saw the music-room was mpty, "here&#xD;
is a haven of rest. Shall we not enter?&#xD;
It was indeed a sacred spot, devoted to the holy Nine by the&#xD;
Emupress ; but there was to-night one little sprite, with danger-&#xD;
ous .arrows, a wicked Cupid, lurking in the temple, that had&#xD;
tried his skill on all that came within. May In z and Count&#xD;
Isolani escape ! In one corner stood a rosewo d piano, its&#xD;
open front revealing a row of beautiful pearl ke; s. Near by,&#xD;
stood a gilded harp, whose tones, in perfect accordI, waited the&#xD;
touch of an Orphean hand.&#xD;
"Captain Navarro has the advantage of me, s uorita," said&#xD;
Count Isolani, as he led Inez to a small sofa, behind the blue&#xD;
and white curtains of the window. " He has already sworn&#xD;
allegiance to our 'ladye fayre,' and obtained the grant of her.&#xD;
favor ; while. I must go through my trial time. However, Giu-&#xD;
lian and I, you know, have agreed to be a second duo, Damon&#xD;
and Phintias, and therefore will not quarrel."&#xD;
" And I," said Inez, smiling 4"am. to take the disagreeable&#xD;
role of Dionysius in this wonderful friendship, am I ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" And we therefore beg that your faithful minister, and&#xD;
executioner, Cupid, be not permitted to use barbed arrows!"&#xD;
"A truce to such raillery," cried Inez, blushing, "and tell&#xD;
me something of the Emperor and Empress. Does her Majesty&#xD;
preside over this little music temple herself?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Count Isolani, " this little room is a favorite&#xD;
gathering-placein the evening, with the members of the House,&#xD;
listening sometimes to the Empress, and again to one of the&#xD;
ladies. The Countess Iollonitz, who left us near a month ago,&#xD;
was a fine performer, and we miss her greatly. But her&#xD;
Majesty proposes to select her ladies from those of the capital&#xD;
soon, which will doubtless add' to our circle."&#xD;
" How fortunate you are, .to. be so near the Emperor and&#xD;
Empress," said Inez.&#xD;
Yes," replied the Count, "being private secretary to the&#xD;
Emperor throws ine much with him; but then we have been&#xD;
together, since our boyhood. While we have peace, this suits&#xD;
very well; but, if there is an issue of arms, I must go to the&#xD;
field."&#xD;
" Ah! but we shall not have that," said Inez; "the dark&#xD;
days for Mexico have passed. But let me ask, my knight, one&#xD;
more question. Do their Majesties intend this palace as their&#xD;
place of residence? "&#xD;
"For the present. The Emperor designs fitting up the old&#xD;
Castle of Chepultepec, just three miles out, you know, for&#xD;
his home ; though the State meetings will all be held here,&#xD;
of course. You have never been through this palace, have you?&#xD;
Guilian or I must show you through, some morning soon. Ah !&#xD;
there he is now ! "&#xD;
" Sleeping on the watch ? " said Giulian, approaching them.&#xD;
"The half-hour has passed, et en quatre;- I. am unselfish&#xD;
enough to come and tell you, that Signor Tortella, our young&#xD;
poet, is about to read his poem in honor of the Empress, and&#xD;

Will you go?"&#xD;
They followed- Giulian into' the audience-room, where the&#xD;
music had ceased, and. the guests were waiting to hear the&#xD;
poem.&#xD;
Signor Tortella, a dark, spirituel-looking young man, stood&#xD;
before the dais, where the Emperor and Empress sat; and while&#xD;
a hush pervaded the apartment, repeated, in an earnest finished&#xD;
style, a tribute of love and gratitude to the young Empress, for&#xD;
her kind patronage of literature and art.&#xD;

&#xD;
As the voice of the speaker ceased, a murmur of applause&#xD;
ran through the guests. Carlotta's face beamed with pleasure.&#xD;
1t was a surprise so agreeable, and unexpected. Rising from&#xD;
her chair, she stood on the first step of the dais; and taking&#xD;
from her finger a beautiful diamond ring, begged him to accept&#xD;
it, as an assurance of' esteem for himself, and all those who&#xD;
endeavored to increase the progress of Art and Science. The&#xD;
Emperor, too, arose, and standing by Carlotta's side, assured the&#xD;
Mexican people that so long as the Empire stood, both the&#xD;
Empress and himself would work for its good, and that noth-&#xD;
ing would be neglected that could elevate Mexico.&#xD;
Taking the Empress's hand, and bowing "good-night," they&#xD;
passed into the Iturbide saloon, and the guests, amid. the&#xD;
music of the band without, began to take their departure.&#xD;
Inez's first evening at the palace had drawn to a close. As&#xD;
she descended to the court-yard with Giulian to enter the car-&#xD;
riage, she remembered nothing of the whirl of pleasure, save the&#xD;
dark eyes, and the good-night of Count Isolani, who had parted&#xD;
with them at the head of the stairs.&#xD;
"Well, Inez ? " said Giulian, as they were on their home-&#xD;
ward way.,&#xD;
"Ah ! Giulian ! " she cried, "how can I thank you enough,&#xD;
for making us come to the capital ? This is indeed the world&#xD;
I have dreamed of ! This is indeed happiness!"&#xD;
" But you say nothing of the Emperor and Empress. I&#xD;
thought you were to see no one beside them," said Giulian,&#xD;
half laughing at her eagerness.&#xD;
"They ? Ah ! it is the old story of the Queen of Sheba: 'the&#xD;
half had not been told me.'&#xD;
"And Count Isolani?"&#xD;
"Ah I" said Inez, not quite so freely, "he is like what I&#xD;
imagined him;-you like him, and I cannot fail to do so. But&#xD;
here we are in our own court-yard. To-morrow must be de-&#xD;
voted to Afita and my uncle, who must hear the adventures&#xD;
of this fairy-like evening. We shall see you to-morrow; shall&#xD;
we not, Giulia? "&#xD;
" I trust so. Our regiment has a dress parade on the Ala-&#xD;
meda in the afternoon; you know we are statio ed near there.&#xD;
But never fear: Isolani will come, if I do not ; your two&#xD;
knights will not neglect you. Pensez a. moi. Gbod-night ! "&#xD;
Giulian left her, and as he made his way thr ugh the quiet&#xD;
streets to the Alameda, and on to the. ene n~ment of the&#xD;

Empress's Guard, his heart thrilled with pride at the remem-&#xD;
brance of the impress that his betrothed had made at the&#xD;
palace. He had thrown all jealousy away; forahe had perfect&#xD;
trust in her now, and there was no shadow of pain in the grati-&#xD;
fied pleasure he felt, that his friend, Count Isolani, must have&#xD;
found her equal to all that he had heard; for on many a moon-&#xD;
lit eve, this friend and confidant had walked with him on the&#xD;
quiet Alameda, when all but themselves had gone, and each&#xD;
had heard the story of the other's life. Giulian had grown&#xD;
familiar with the old castle in the Tyrol, and in his mind's eye&#xD;
had seen the beautiful Miramar again and again, as he listened&#xD;
to the reminiscences of the days Count Isolani had passed with&#xD;
the Archduke. Count Isolani had known the idol of his&#xD;
friend's heart; -knew, before he saw her, of her beauty and&#xD;
accomplishments, and had wished in secret that he could find one&#xD;
that would fill his nature, as Inez Gonzales filled Giulian's.&#xD;
And so, with mutual confidence, and interchange-of sympathy,&#xD;
they had learned to prize each other; and thank the fortune&#xD;
that had thrown them together.&#xD;
And Inez? She, too, ran over the evening in her mind, and&#xD;
as she laid her head upon her quiet pillow, thought of her two&#xD;
knights, a little tremulously, perhaps ; - thought G-unt Isolani&#xD;
like Giulian; and yet so unlike ! She hoped they would both&#xD;
come on the morrow!&#xD;
A  week passed, during which Inez .was 'not forgotten.&#xD;
Count, Isolani came with Giulian to pay his compliments to&#xD;
Anaita and herself. An event it was- to Afita, who went out&#xD;
so little ; and food for thought and comment until something&#xD;
more extraordinary presented itself.&#xD;
The Empress had.been much impressed with the beauty and&#xD;
grace of Senorita Gonzales upon the reception evening, and as&#xD;
she was about to appoint her dames and maids of honor from&#xD;
the Mexican ladies, she had at once decided to offer to Inez&#xD;
the position left vacant by the Countess- Kollonitz, who had&#xD;
already returned to Europe; and a note from the Grand Cham-&#xD;
berlain of the palace was addressed to Inez, requesting her at-&#xD;
tendance.&#xD;
It had been but two weeks since her deb2t, and with the&#xD;
remembrance of the pleasures of that night still on her mind,&#xD;
Inez was delighted with the prospect.&#xD;
Anita and Don Ruy, though complimented and gratified at&#xD;
this mark of favor, raised many objections; but, they at last&#xD;

consented, provided her home should not be entirely given up,&#xD;
that she should be in attendance at the palace when her Majesty&#xD;
desired. She was, however, to g' there for the first month, or&#xD;
until she became accustomed to her duties.&#xD;
To Inez, the change was delightful. Though her uncle's&#xD;
home was elegant and tasteful, yet it had an atmosphere of&#xD;
gloom and stateliness about it that could not be dispelled. But&#xD;
now life wore its brightest, happiest face to Inez. At the&#xD;
palace she would be the constant friend and companion of the&#xD;
Empa ess -- a privilege which Inez felt would be no small one,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
NEZ GONZALES was a good Catholic and a good&#xD;
Christian.  With but few influences, sacred or other-&#xD;
wise, from the outside world and her fell w-creatures,&#xD;
thrown about her youth, she had grown up under the&#xD;
teachings of her own pure heart, which told her of the good-&#xD;
ness and loveof the great Creator. Listening to the voice of&#xD;
Nature without, that spoke as a familiar friend to her soul,&#xD;
she had formed for herself a system of piety and religion, which,&#xD;
though perhaps hartily accepted as orthodox by the Church,&#xD;
yet had in her the viistue of fervent sincerity'.&#xD;
In her old home at Querataro, there had been none, save&#xD;
sometimes to Giulian, to whom she revealed the impulses that&#xD;
stirred her girlish heart. True, Ahita had taught her that&#xD;
nightly she must tell her beads, and whisper her Ave Maria&#xD;
when in the time of danger or of temptation; that, as a daugh-&#xD;
ter of the Church, on Fridays she must eat no meat. Yet in&#xD;
her soul, Inez felt that this was not enough; that the senseless&#xD;
mumbling of careless prayers, as often she had herd them from&#xD;
the old priest that ministered in the Cathedralat Querataro -&#xD;
pxayers hurried through with irreverent haste -this, she felt,&#xD;
* The author has not taken undue liberty here, s the Empress .arlotta had many&#xD;
Mexican dames d'onneur, who resided at their own homes in the sty, and were only&#xD;
in attendance on reception evenings and state occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
could not reach, or come as near the ear of God, as the C"voice&#xD;
of the lark with her singing."  The girl felt that the heartless&#xD;
observance of forms and ceremonies was but mocking the all-&#xD;
loving One ; and that in offering this, as her religion, as the be-&#xD;
ginning and end of her faith and duty, to her immortal spirit,&#xD;
that, burning with holy emotions, craved a higher creed, a&#xD;
warmer devotion, she did but give it a "stone, instead of the&#xD;
bread of life." Not that she dissented from the faith of the&#xD;
.Roman Church: that, she was taught from her childhood, was&#xD;
the "true spouse of Christ; " but it was practical religion, as&#xD;
she saw. it wanting in its followers, that she felt was overlooked ;&#xD;
and she endeavored to bring it, into her daily life.&#xD;
And so, growing up, half alone, following her own inclina-&#xD;
tions, giving play to the dreamy fancies- of her unfettered&#xD;
soul, Inez fell into an ideal kind of life; and perhaps, in her&#xD;
own way, stumbled nearer the truth than wise philosophers,&#xD;
who seek 'to find it, guided by the head, and not the heart.&#xD;
She observed, as has been mentioned, with scrupulous care the&#xD;
ordinances of her Church; yet her faith and practice was to&#xD;
look abroad upon the earth, in its beautiful and gay apparel-&#xD;
ing; in her evening walk, to mark the clothing of the lowly&#xD;
lily; to. watch the sunlight chasing the dew-drop from  its&#xD;
grassy bed, or sinking in glorious majesty behind the distant&#xD;
hills; to feel her soul tremble with thanksgiving and j  as&#xD;
she whispered to her heart, " these are the gifts of my Father,&#xD;
made by Him for me." And when at the vesper hour, she un-&#xD;
clasped the Holy Book of God, and read again of the greater&#xD;
holier gift than all others, she felt that Christ came to die for&#xD;
her; that, had no other man, woman, or child transgressed the&#xD;
law, yet wpuld her Father have given His Son for her souls&#xD;
salvation ; and then, each page of the undying record would&#xD;
shine with a diviner lustre, and her heart would lift itself&#xD;
anew in adoration and thankfulness. She loved the holy God&#xD;
with no craven thought of fear; and the service she offered&#xD;
Him was not to escape punishment, but an expression of deep,&#xD;
and fervent gratitude.&#xD;
Her father's, Don Juan Gonzales', code of morality might .&#xD;
have been summed up in the one word, " Honor." Be honora-&#xD;
ble, and all other virtues come. He taught his daughter  and&#xD;
tried to teach his son, that their word, even though lightly&#xD;
given, must be held sacred; and a breach of faith was a stain&#xD;
upon their escutcheon, that no after repentance could efraice.,&#xD;
lie encouraged JneZ to e xcel in, all that she undertook ; and&#xD;

saw to it that neither she nor Juan, his son, lacked for oppor-&#xD;
tunities to cultivate their mental endowments'; to Anita and&#xD;
the priest he left them, for spiritual knowledge. With one, the&#xD;
t res that grow naturally in the human heart, in greater or less&#xD;
lixuriance, as the soil fosters them, rooted out and. crushed&#xD;
down all the seed, which, when grown up to the period of fruit-&#xD;
bearing, there was iione to be found. There gere no golden&#xD;
sheaves in Juan's field, and so he went-his own way. But with&#xD;
Inez it was different. Deep and impassioned in soul, truth&#xD;
itself in word and deed, she was unswerving in the right path,.&#xD;
and unflagging in energy in the pursuit of all that enriches the&#xD;
mind and ennobles the soul; and so, at the time of her intro-&#xD;
duction to the reader, and of her coming4to the capital, it&#xD;
would have been difficult to find, in Mexico or elsewhere, a&#xD;
jewel so richly set. True, there had been with her that longing&#xD;
to see and know the world, and taste of its pleasures, natural-&#xD;
o youth, and which the soul, later in life, condemns, with the&#xD;
preacher, as all "vanity and vexation;" yet think lesson was one&#xD;
that she must learn, that all must learn-" the emptiness of'life"&#xD;
-- before the earth-loving eyes can be turned towards the other&#xD;
land; those eyes must be opened bySorrow, before they can see,&#xD;
through the mists that hang over the dark river, the crystal&#xD;
pebbles that strew the shining shore beyond. Inez Gonzales&#xD;
began this life-lesson at the palace in Mexico.&#xD;
It was impossible for two persons so congenial, in refined&#xD;
taste and sympathy, as was the Empress Carlotta and her new*&#xD;
naid of honor, to meet, without becoming united by the&#xD;
strongest ties of ;friendship and love.&#xD;
During .the first month that Jnez spent a~ the palace, the&#xD;
admiration with which the Empress had at fi st regarded her,&#xD;
on account of her personal beauty, was deepe ed into respect&#xD;
and esteem, as she daily discovered the many attractions of&#xD;
her mind and heart. She found her a cultivated friend and&#xD;
companion, familiar with the poets, ancient and modern, whose&#xD;
works are household friends in Europe andAmerica ; fond of&#xD;
music, and interested in all the arts and sciences that come&#xD;
within a woman's sphere. Their intercourse with each other&#xD;
took a higher, more intellectual tone than is usually accorded&#xD;
to the interchange of thought with the female mind; and their&#xD;
conversation drifted, perhaps, beyond the $iit allotted to&#xD;
woman's ability and comprehension; and yet, it was not often&#xD;
that either found themselves in danger of wr oking their barks,&#xD;
&#xD;
{I&#xD;

upon the sea o, knowledge: there seemed always ballast&#xD;
enough to save tliem.&#xD;
When the period arrived that had been fixed for Inez to&#xD;
return t? her uncle's, the Empress declared she could not give&#xD;
her up; that the palace must be her home; and arranging that&#xD;
she could see her relatives, whenever she or they desired, Inez&#xD;
nothing loth, consented, and became at once established as one&#xD;
as theroyal family.&#xD;
On the evenings of the weekly receptions at the palace, the&#xD;
different ladies of honor appointed. by Her Majesty since her&#xD;
arrival in Mexico were all present; but Inez and the Countess&#xD;
Zichy were the only two who were with the Empress- as com-&#xD;
panions Count; Frangois Zichy being one of the officers of the&#xD;
household, and a warm friend to the Emperor.&#xD;
Often, there was a drive with the Empress on the Alameda,&#xD;
the park of the capital; or, if the Empress accompanied" the&#xD;
Emperor en chevat to review the troops about the city, or exam-&#xD;
ine the fortifications that were being thrown up for its defence,&#xD;
Inez always accompanied, usually attended by Count Isolani,&#xD;
the Emperor's aid and secretary. Sometimes Captain Navarro&#xD;
joined, them, though he was oftenest on duty with his regi-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Then, there were visits to be made to the -hospitals with the&#xD;
Empress; to the schools that she had established; or some-&#xD;
times it was a stately morning, at some one of the old convents,&#xD;
with the solemn, sad-looking nuns, who received and enter-&#xD;
tained them with a kind of habitual funereal graciousness. On&#xD;
many occasions, particularly upon their charitable missions,&#xD;
the Empress preferred to walk, that her alms-giving might not&#xD;
be paraded through the streets with vain-glorying and ostenta-&#xD;
tious pride. She gave of her plenty to the poor, and it was a&#xD;
pure motive that impelled her to give them her presence like-&#xD;
wise; in love for the souls of her people and pity for their suf-&#xD;
fering the shining coin was given, with a word of encourage-&#xD;
ment and ,comfort, that perhaps fed the.spirit that was all un-&#xD;
used to such.  While she ministered to the body, Carlotta&#xD;
did not forget the spiritual wants.&#xD;
As the Emperor was much engaged in the morning with&#xD;
affairs of business, Inez and the Empress were then much to-&#xD;
gether. In the evening, the little music-room in the rear of the&#xD;
grand saloon was a favorite gathering-place~ with the household&#xD;
and many an hour flitted a-way there unheeded: the Emperor&#xD;
and Empress engaged with some guest, perhaps, and Inez with&#xD;

The Emperor breakfasted alone at an&#xD;

When they were not called out by some&#xD;

which stood a half-finished picture; near b&#xD;

filled with boxes of paint, brushes, pallet, etc&#xD;

adorned with pictures, most of them painte&#xD;
herself at Miramar ; she had brought them&#xD;
irs of that dear home and happy past.&#xD;
Many long delightful hours did Inez and&#xD;
together in this little room. Sometimes,&#xD;

"'Tis Jupiter that brings whate'er is great,&#xD;
And Venus everything that's fair."&#xD;
Surely," said Inez, commenting as she passed on in her&#xD;
reading, "these two powerful divinities lent their propitious&#xD;
beams to the Emperor and yourself; for there seems to be only&#xD;
good fortune attending you both."&#xD;
"Ah, yes I1" said the Empress; " old Seni's fanciful theory&#xD;
does well enough; but there is a truer one, is there not, Inez,&#xD;
that tells us' each soul is the star of its own destiny'? But let&#xD;
us}get on to Thekla and her lover, the noble Piccolomini. We&#xD;
must not be so daring as to place our ideas against, or contro-&#xD;
vert Schiller's; it would be blasphemy in Germany."&#xD;
Inez continued the reading, and came to the scene between&#xD;
the lovers, half-tearful, yet very tender, where Thekla, in&#xD;
answer to his murmurings, answers him softly,&#xD;
"Are we not happy nowi Art thou not mine&#xD;
Am I not thine? There lies within my soul&#xD;
A lofty courage ; 'tis love gives it to me!1&#xD;
I ought to be less open, -ought to hide&#xD;
My heart more from thee: so decorum dictates:&#xD;
But where in this place could'st thou seek for truth,&#xD;
If in my mouth thou did'st not find it?"&#xD;
"Poor Thekla!" said her Majesty, as Inez paused, "it was&#xD;
an evil star that shone upon her love ! - Do you believe, that&#xD;
when the heart centres itself upon another that there is strength&#xD;
enough in. human will to keep it locked within the soul?    It&#xD;
may be hidden from -careless eyes; it may be kept a secret gem&#xD;
from the world; but does not the one to whom it belongs, to&#xD;
whom every thought, every action turns, hold a mysterious&#xD;
power over the heart that yields allegiance, that will discover&#xD;
what we strive in vain to conceal ?"&#xD;
Her Majesty's words hardly formed themselves into a ques-&#xD;
tion, but seemed more a half-murmured soliloquy to herself,&#xD;
and she did not notice the slight blush that overspread the&#xD;
girl's face and the serious, thoughtful look that had stolen into&#xD;
her eyes. . The Empress went on with her painting, and Inez,&#xD;
with the book lying half-open on her lap, apparently, watched&#xD;
her brush. But her thoughts had found a channel, into which&#xD;
she hardly dared permit them flow. She was wondering if she'&#xD;
had ever felt this all-powerful love that her Majesty spoke of.&#xD;
It had been Giulian's gentle chiding that she had kept all these&#xD;
fond emotions, that he trusted she felt for him, hidden too&#xD;
 much; and yet it seemed to her that she expressed all she fdLt&#xD;

to see more truly than ever that she should never love him with&#xD;
that wild devotion, with that stirring intensity that others&#xD;
spoke of. She knew that he was noble     d good; that he&#xD;
would be faithful in the keeping of her hear ; and she would&#xD;
marry him. 4But then, --and Inez trembled as if in the pres-&#xD;
ence of evil at the thought,--she wished she might feel this&#xD;
true love, that passeth all understanding. Had she ever seen&#xD;
one that she thought could call it up ?  He heart was silent,&#xD;
or it dared not give answer. Yes, there was one; perhaps, if&#xD;
iulian were more like him, the waters would ow out unbidden.&#xD;
It came to her for the first time, as she sat there, that she had&#xD;
been deceiving herself: that the charm which Count Isolani's&#xD;
society had for her was not alone because he was Giulian's&#xD;
friend; because he spoke of Giulian as a brother, and loved him&#xD;
as such. 'Surely, surely, she was not learning to love Victor&#xD;
Isolani for himself. And the Empress had said the secret could&#xD;
not be kept back. There was terror in the thought. If her&#xD;
heart was treacherous, O God ! help her to keep it to herself;&#xD;
help her to root it out; let not Victor Isolani despise her for&#xD;
her unsought love, let not Giulian scorn he for her broken&#xD;
faith.'&#xD;
There were footsteps in the little parlor adjoining ; and in a&#xD;
few moments the Emperor appeared at the door.&#xD;
"Is the sanctum sanctorum closed this morning ?" he said&#xD;
'playfully, as he waited for a moment. "'As this is your Maj-&#xD;
esty's private kingdom, I come to beg admittance for Colonel&#xD;
Lopez and myself. He is waiting here, and is anxious to see&#xD;
your Majesty's pictures, and the engraving of Chamounix,&#xD;
which, I believe, is in our collection there, is it not?"&#xD;
As the Emperor spoke, Colonel Miguel Lopez, who had come&#xD;
up with him from his private cabinet, appeare at his side.&#xD;
"Aht Colonel Lopez," said the Empress, rising and putting&#xD;
aside her easel, -"I am glad to fulfil a promise which I be-&#xD;
lipve you hold against me for some time past  o show you these&#xD;
engravings, which are indeed fine. As for the pictures, they&#xD;
are not much: only prized by Maximilian and myself, for their&#xD;
association"-&#xD;
" And prized by all Mexicans," said Colonel Lopez, as he&#xD;
s~ood with the Empress before a little sunset view of Miramar,&#xD;

saoh, they are dearer than a thousand Raphael) or Guidos." .&#xD;
~'Seaiorita Inz, said the Emperor to Inez, who had risen and&#xD;
was standing by the window, "I left a most disconsolate knight&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JEWEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
- 215&#xD;
&#xD;
below, and promised that I would send you with your sym-&#xD;
pathetic heart to comfort him. Count Isolani," continued the&#xD;
Emperor, as Inez looked up inquiringly, "has just lost his&#xD;
magnificent bay, which you know was presented to him last&#xD;
summer by the Prefect here; and he has all the fires of remorse&#xD;
and self-reproach mingled with his sorrow, as the veterinary&#xD;
tells him the horse's death was caused from over-exertion in a&#xD;
race which he and Captain Navarro took to Gaudahtpe yester-&#xD;
day afternoon. Do go down, and comfort him before his heart&#xD;
is quite broken."&#xD;
Complying with the Emperor's request, Inez left the studio,&#xD;
and descended to the reception-room, where- she found Count&#xD;
Isolani waiting  She did not like to meet him now alone. She&#xD;
was afraid that some involuntary tinge of the cheek or tremor&#xD;
of the'voice would betray her heart's secret, and yet it was well&#xD;
enough to begin the struggle to-day, for she knew that she&#xD;
could not face her conscience while she bore this guilty bur-&#xD;
den.&#xD;
Count Isolani rose as she entered, and came forward with a&#xD;
half-comic, despairing face to meet her.&#xD;
. "Ah ! Senorita; you have come ! Did the Emperor lay my&#xD;
piteous case before you? Colonel Lopez has promised to put&#xD;
Captain Navarro on double duty, as it was1he that tempted me&#xD;
to the race ; but for him, I should have gone staidly and soberly&#xD;
along with the'other Christian people on the Alameda, and poor&#xD;
Hassan might have been in life to-day!"&#xD;
" Ah ! Count," said Inez, smiling, " Black Hassan has only&#xD;
paid the debt that his master must pay to nature, too, sooner or&#xD;
later. If there was only a heaven for this nobler order of: the&#xD;
brute creation, there would ofttimes be comfort in the thought.&#xD;
As it is, I can only offer you my profoundest sympathy. It is&#xD;
scarcely practicable just now to build a city, &amp;amp; 1a Alexander,&#xD;
for this modern Bucephalus; or, after Caligula's fashion, canonize&#xD;
Black Hassan; so you must practise the virtue of fortitude and&#xD;
resignation under your affliction."&#xD;
"Yes," said the Count; "I can only chant the great Sir Wal-&#xD;
ter's requiem,-&#xD;
wo worth the chase, wo worth the day,&#xD;
That cost thy life, my gallant gray.'&#xD;
Let us drop a tear to Hassan's memory, and, consecrated with&#xD;
that sacred tribute, let it pass. I have a 'coraimission to fill,&#xD;
Seniorita, and am afraid to trust my memory with it longer;&#xD;

to say, that, with your permission, he would oin you in the&#xD;

ta's benefit."&#xD;
"Ah ! yes, and I can tell you a secret," said nez, "though I&#xD;
suppose it is hardly one now. The Emperor nd Empress go&#xD;
tQ-night, and her Majesty is going to present a Signora with&#xD;
a beautiful set of diamonds, in token of her appreciation of her&#xD;

"How kind, and how like the Empress Carlotta ! " said the&#xD;
Count. "I have not yet heard Signora Peralta, but will of&#xD;
course go to-night. Does she give us Spanish cr Italian ?"&#xD;
' Italian, I think ; we shall doubtless have a fine house."&#xD;
" I had almost forgotten my own petition.- a drive on the&#xD;

Count Khevenhiller has them splendidly mounted and drilled,&#xD;

CHAPTER. XXIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE weeks and days of Inez's life at t&#xD;
slipping away. The novelty attending I&#xD;
passed,, and while she was as much a&#xD;
Empress as possible, she was beginning&#xD;
the exciting pleasure, or the listless ease that&#xD;
time ;- and ofttimes, when, in the moments of re&#xD;
between the coming and going, she asked hers(&#xD;
happier in the world, or as she was at Querata&#xD;
waited to hear her heart's sigh as it gave answ(&#xD;
home there had been no temptation, no test by&#xD;
her strength. She had come here believing, he&#xD;
with. truth and faithfulness, and at the first&#xD;
herself giving way.&#xD;
&#xD;
he palace were&#xD;

attached to the&#xD;
g to weary of&#xD;

elf if she were&#xD;
o, she scarcely&#xD;
r. At the old&#xD;
which to prove&#xD;
self panoplied&#xD;
rial she found&#xD;
&#xD;
Again and again, Inez asked herself what sudden charm had&#xD;
made Victor Isolani so dear to her. What was there in the&#xD;
deep tones of his voice that made it more welcome than all&#xD;
others; and why did his face, instead of Giulian's, haunt her in&#xD;
her hours of -solitude ?  She began to grow nervous for the&#xD;
presence of her betrothed in the evening circle. To see, his&#xD;
trust and love for her, would help her to still the wrongful&#xD;
pleadings of her heart.  Inez was not blind to the fact&#xD;
that Count Isolani was not indifferent to herself. A hundred&#xD;
-things told her each day, that the same struggle had come to&#xD;
him that had arisen in her own heart. She knew that he was&#xD;
too noble to take advantage-of his friend ; that,.although he&#xD;
might know her heart was his, yet she believed that he was&#xD;
strong enough to put aside his happiness, rather than purchase&#xD;
it with his honor.&#xD;
Inez was right. Victor Isolani was trying to keep that pre-&#xD;
cious jewel bright in his soul. He could not blind himself with&#xD;
the false persuasion that he'was attracted towards this beautiful&#xD;
girl, with no deeper, stronger feeling than that of friendship.&#xD;
He had begun to look to the quiet evening hours, when tley&#xD;
were often tite-A-tte in the music-room, while the Emperor&#xD;
and Empress were engaged with their guests, as the centre of&#xD;
the day's happiness. There was a soft gentleness about her-man,&#xD;
ner that fascinated him more each time he saw her, and the&#xD;
chords of her soul, deep-toned, and full of poetic feeling; seemed&#xD;
in unison with his own.&#xD;
Never before had Count Isolani seen the woman to whom&#xD;
he could give his heart's love, free and entire; and he stood&#xD;
aghast with horror, as the bright vision of happiness came to&#xD;
him, o'ershadowed by the pall of despair. Love thefancee of&#xD;
another! the betrothed of his bosom's friend! It was in vain&#xD;
that he brought the philosophy of reason to bear upon the mad-&#xD;
ness of his passion. This current that had swept in to him,&#xD;
from the sea of life, dashed each argument aside, as though they&#xD;
were the toy-mills of childhood. He felt himself borne on at&#xD;
first, without roast or sail. He knew that he loved Inez Gon-&#xD;
zales more than he dreamed it possible that woman could be&#xD;
loved, and in his hours of greatest trial there was a mocking,&#xD;
tempting voice that whispered, "Why should k0 be happy,&#xD;
and you go lonely and loveless, through the weary years that&#xD;
are to come. She may love youd!' And then the solemn truth&#xD;
would mournfully come home to him, as it does to the children&#xD;

" No, no !" cried Fount Isolani, as his soul w ked up from its&#xD;
dream; "he would learn 'to conquer himself. e would not be.&#xD;
a traitor to himself, nor to his friend.." He w uld not throw&#xD;
himself in temptation's way, for he knew there was danger in&#xD;
her paths. He would only see Inez as he did the other ladies&#xD;
of the Court, and perhaps time would aid him  o put aside his&#xD;
love. It was hard to give up those precious hours with the&#xD;
only one he had found that knew the language of his heart's&#xD;
yoice:' and yet it must be done. And so there crept into their&#xD;
casual meetings a mutual embarrassment and restraint, -that&#xD;
told to each, without a word, the bitter truth  While those&#xD;
two struggled in secret, Giulian's life went on in a blissful,&#xD;
happy dream. It was enough, that he had Ine 's promise, and&#xD;
he believed he had her love, as much as she wouldd ever give&#xD;
to any one, and he thanked God daily for the bk ssing; and the&#xD;
friendship and confidence between himself and Victor Isolani&#xD;
went on the same. Victor listened in' silence t his dreams of&#xD;
the future. Alas! there was no picture, save f darkness and&#xD;
despair, for him ! How little Giulian dreamed hat the corner-&#xD;
4tone upon which his temple of happiness was eared, was his&#xD;

It was a cold, raw morning in March. A driyig mist with-&#xD;
out, enveloped houses and street in gloomy haz ess; and gray,&#xD;
lowering clouds drifted slowly across the horizo&#xD;
The Empress was' preparing a budget of letters for Europe;&#xD;
and Inez had the morning to herself. For an hour or more,&#xD;
she sat by the high window of her own room, looking outupon&#xD;
the drearyPlaza, and the cold, stony face of the Cathedral be-&#xD;
yond. At last, growing tired of watching the hapless pedes-&#xD;
trians that now and- then crossed the square, a d of listlessly&#xD;
dreaming over the book that lay open on the esement beside&#xD;
her, she thought of her 'harp that she had sadly neglected of.&#xD;
late ; and, rising, she went' through the cor-ridor, ad softly down&#xD;
the stairs, into the little music-roonm in the rear of the grand&#xD;
loon. There was not a chance that she should bi disturbed,&#xD;
and, scarcely looking about her, she' laid her book upon the&#xD;
piano, and seated herself 'beside the harp.&#xD;

sf , as the spirit of the music crept into her soil, her voice&#xD;
ra ally grew stronger and fuller, and,. floating through the&#xD;
half-closed door that led into the reception-room, filled its&#xD;
legh and breadth with rich melody. As she finished, and&#xD;
he voice died away, she looked up, and Count Isolani stood in&#xD;
the doorway.&#xD;
"Is it wrong, senorita," said he, coming towards her, as he&#xD;
noticed the flush that overspread Inez's face,."that we should&#xD;
sometimes take advantage of circumstances to remit the heart's&#xD;
penance ? I had come down to while away the dreary nworn-&#xD;
i  with Goeithe in the reception-room,-finer temperaments,&#xD;
yo know are true barometers, always affected by change of&#xD;
tem erature;- so say those who have analyzed the invisible&#xD;
wires that control the heart through these mysterious outside&#xD;
influences. Goethe and I are both sad this morning, - a tinge,&#xD;
erhaps of the ffeimweh that clings to German hearts. I&#xD;
should not have disturbed you, but for a longing to hear that&#xD;
old song again. In token of forgiveness, will you sing the last&#xD;
verse once more?"&#xD;
Could'victor Isolani have placed himself back in the, recep-&#xD;
tion-room a moment later, how gladly would he have done so!I&#xD;
Scarcely had those sweet tones, now softened by a tremor of&#xD;
sadness fallen upon his listening ear, than his heart told him&#xD;
" it was not good, that he was here," - that he was not&#xD;
strong enough yet, to overcome the enemy within; but an irre-&#xD;
sistible impulse, a yearning for sympathy that he knew Inez&#xD;
could 'give had led him to her ; and so he stood there, lean-&#xD;
ing one arm upon the piano, and looking, - hopelessly and&#xD;
'tenderly,- into her face.&#xD;
"Dear old'Germany ! " he exclaimed, as she finished again,&#xD;
and struck out the rich chords of the symphony. "llow many&#xD;
remembrances hang about these songs ! "&#xD;
"Yes," said Inez, "we are told by poets, you know, that the&#xD;
perfume of a flower  a half-forgotten melody -have greatest&#xD;
power to bring up past joy, or sorrow!"&#xD;
"Yes," said the Count, "the twilight song of the evening&#xD;
wai4ler calls up the distant chimes; and ofttimes they ring&#xD;
out fiercely, even in the midnight hours, heard by noother&#xD;
ear save our own; and phantom forms, that were realities&#xD;

"This morning, as I look back,' seforita, it is a darksome&#xD;
picture. In our fitful moods, we see things di erently. To-&#xD;
morrow, perhaps, there might be scenes of the past, lit up by the&#xD;

"And yet, in the quiet of solitude, with no tangible sorrow&#xD;

low tones that fell on his ear seemed the teachings of the good&#xD;
spirit of which they spoke.           -&#xD;
"There is a Higher Power, Count Isolani - One who, though&#xD;

'If these jewels aei  agro  en lost, there is a prayer that l&#xD;

head nearer "youknow the battle I am fighting ; helpme!&#xD;
help me to gain the victory! Pray .God to deliver, me from &#xD;
temptation!"&#xD;
He could not trust himself longer. He looked into her face,&#xD;
and he read; there that she had need of the same prayer. He&#xD;
took the hand that lay upon the edge of the gilded harp, and-&#xD;
pressed it to his lips; another moment, and the door closed be-&#xD;
hind him, and Inez was alone.&#xD;
She leaned her head upon the harp, and miserably weak, in&#xD;
spite of her beautiful Christian teachings, she felt ; and in bit-&#xD;
terness of spirit, felt for the moment that she could not pray.&#xD;
Wh should she give up this love for Victor Isolani?  Why&#xD;
should they both be miserable'?&#xD;
It was only a moment that her heart rebelled against her&#xD;
faith. Giulian came before her with the long years of love and&#xD;
kindness that he laid at. her feet. She remembered -her dead&#xD;
father's words as he had placed her hand in his, and blessed&#xD;
them both.  She remembered this, and she rose up strong&#xD;

fair domain of which he was monarch. The Azt&#xD;

quest, into his grave, and his dust long ago has&#xD;
the mother Earth. As time went on, the proud&#xD;
lordly Viceroy of Spain took the place of the old&#xD;
the power passed,.too, from Spain, and Desolatio&#xD;
abode in the regal apartments, once so full of&#xD;
splendor; and in the. solemn hush that hung fo&#xD;
the .spot, there was no sound to be heard, save th&#xD;
Decay, as she crept stealthily to.and fro, or the ca I&#xD;
ring of her feathered children, who, with her, hel&#xD;
possession. The hoary cypress trees without, a&#xD;
against the destroying spirit. They stood there&#xD;
against all attack, as 'grim  sentinels guarding&#xD;
sacred ruins, mournfully waving, with their long&#xD;
arms, at every breath, a funereal drapery of tangl&#xD;
ut to the American heart another memory co&#xD;

&#xD;
dust and smoke of battle; the names of Montezuma and al-&#xD;
vez are forgotten, as Memory whispers those of "Worth and&#xD;
Pillow."&#xD;
u now Chepultepec has awaked ! Old things are passing&#xD;
away, and  l hnsaemkn         new., The Emperor Maxi-&#xD;
mia an, imbued with the love of romance and beauty, always&#xD;
honoring past glories, and seeking the enchantment of old asso-&#xD;
ciations had selected Chepultepec as his future home and pal-&#xD;
ace. Architects and artisans had been set to work, and the&#xD;
aspect of the old castle under their skilful han s and assiduous&#xD;
labor, had rapidly changed. The cobwebs of y rs were brushed&#xD;
away from the grand apartments, and the sunshine looked&#xD;
strangely, wonderingly in, upon rooms that had been long en-&#xD;
veloped in gloom. The bright gilding of the cornice-work&#xD;
lit up the dark walls; pand the great carved doors, that had&#xD;
rusted on their hinges, opened to the new-corner.&#xD;
Without in the old garden, the same renovation has found&#xD;
its way: Careful' hands have unlocked the close embrace of&#xD;
the tangled shrubbery. Again, beautiful walks wind through&#xD;
beds of flowers, and fallen fountains lift up their marble heads,&#xD;
and begin again their songs. Noble avenues of trees lead&#xD;
down the hillside, and a carriage-way comes up under the cy-&#xD;
ress boughs that overarch, to the terrace in front.&#xD;
It was a quiet April afternoon, and the Emperor and Em-&#xD;
press had ridden out with a party of ladies and gentlemen, to&#xD;
inspect the progress the workmen were making. They had&#xD;
gone through the castle from room to room, into the long pic-&#xD;
ture gallery, with its treasures of art; into the grand saloon&#xD;
that would soon echo with the voices of life and gayety, into&#xD;
the little chapel, with its antique oaken altar, its stone widows&#xD;
and vaulted roof, and its dark walls that showed the saints in&#xD;
p ictured prayer, and had now come out to the high terrace that&#xD;
ran in a circle around the castle, to take the view of the valley,&#xD;
as it unrolled itself in front.&#xD;
The members of their suite had wandered in different direc-&#xD;
tions about the grounds; and Maximilian and Carlotta stood&#xD;
alone together. For some moments both were silent, regarding&#xD;
with an admiration too deep for words, the wide panorama,&#xD;
spread by the hand of God, over the plain before them.&#xD;
Far, far in the distance extended the valley, sweeping on-&#xD;
ward in green, embaying curves, until it reached the foot of&#xD;
the mountains that wall in the Hesperides garden. Rising in&#xD;
majesty in the centre of the long range of giant hills, that wind&#xD;

zielite, who was often at the palace, followed while Inez and&#xD;
inhan brought up the rear.&#xD;
A quiet tete-r-tete was indulged in by the couples, who rode&#xD;
sbme distance apart. As the sunlight faded at last quite&#xD;
away, they slackened their pace, and the. horses trod leisurely&#xD;
a ong the gravelled road. It led now into a grove of some&#xD;
tent, of elms and oak, through which a gurglin  stream went&#xD;
dancing over its  rocky bed, between moss-covered lily-fringed&#xD;
banks. Just where it reached the road, stood a clump of low,&#xD;
t ick, growing bushes, that skirted the- rivulet for a little&#xD;
way; and a huge rock, firmly fixed in the bank, half-leaned over&#xD;
the clear water. The party had all gone ahead, and as Inez&#xD;
and Giulian approached the little stream, the first beams of&#xD;
the rising moon stole through the dark branches of the trees,&#xD;
a d cast the shadow of the shining leaves in the crystal mir-&#xD;
Was it -imagination, or in truth a human figure, that, it&#xD;
s emed to Inez, she could dimly see, to rise from behind the&#xD;
lo, trees and move up the stream? Giulian noticed nothing-&#xD;
ari before Inez could speak to him, her spirited horse had&#xD;
taken fright, and dashed off in the direction of the figure, if it&#xD;
were such.&#xD;
9ne of those unaccountable suspicions -- the intuition that&#xD;
never leads woman astray- hadflashed through Inez's mind, if&#xD;
this, was aught human, spying upon the actions of the royal&#xD;
party, it might be, she felt the presence of evil- she&#xD;
knew not how or whence he came but it might&#xD;
brother. i-uan, er&#xD;
Iter horse had stumbled at the root of an old tree some&#xD;
hundred yards in the forest, and as she reined him quickly up,&#xD;
it seemed to her she heard the well-known hissing tone - p'&#xD;
" Take care, Inez Gonzales ! the sun shines upon your cause&#xD;
no, but it may set to-morrow. Think not yourself secure I"&#xD;
Ipez, in her terror, loosed her hold upon the reins, and the&#xD;
bewildered animal would have set off again, when a strong&#xD;
hand seized them, and Inez heard Giulian's voice at her side.&#xD;
" Inez, my own!" he cried in a voice anxious with emotion,&#xD;
you are safe ? you are not hurt? What could have fright..&#xD;
ened your horse ? "&#xD;
"Only an escapade," said Inez, trying to convince hersef&#xD;
who e she was, and collecting her thoughts; '"I am all right,&#xD;
exeta sprained foot; I believe. This wild creature gaem&#xD;
stirup an ugly twist as he dashed off."   .    gv    y&#xD;

&#xD;
It had been the work of a moment, and before they reached&#xD;
the road again, Inez had almost persuaded'herself that it was&#xD;
her excited fancy that had called up the figure, and the voice;&#xD;
and that it had been the shadow of the leaves dancing on the&#xD;
water that had frightened the horse.&#xD;
She would not mention it to Giulian; it would only bring&#xD;
up unpleasant memories; and then, how was it possible that&#xD;
Juan could be in such a place? True, he might be in the city&#xD;
as a spy, and, always watching the Emperor, had taken advan-&#xD;
tage of an accident to-night, to gratify his old love of making&#xD;
her miserable. If this were so, ought she to mention it ? Was&#xD;
the Emperor in danger ?  Would not- the military police dis-&#xD;
cover the presence of spies, if there were such in Mexico?&#xD;
Inez felt humiliated at the thought of Juan's taking such posi-&#xD;
tion, and she resolved to dismiss the whole, as a conjuration of&#xD;
her own brain.&#xD;
" I am afraid you are suffering, Inez," said Giulian, as they&#xD;
rode on, and the silence was lengthened. "I see the lights of&#xD;
the city, and hear the music from the band on the Plaza. We&#xD;
shall soon be at the palace ; but the others will get in before&#xD;
us."&#xD;
" Yes, but we can hurry on, and reach the court-yard before&#xD;
the gates are closed," said Inez, anxiously.&#xD;
They were soon in the Court, and found the others but just&#xD;
arrived, and standing on the corridor waiting a moment for&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Ah ! what laggards lovers are !" cried the Empress, as Giu-&#xD;
lian and Inez came up the stone steps; "after this we shall see&#xD;
to it that you two are not left behind. An accident?" con-&#xD;
tinued the Empress anxiously, as Giulian interposed, and began&#xD;
the explanation of their detention. "You are not hurt, my&#xD;
child ?  Come in with me;" and she took Inez's arm, and led&#xD;
her towards her own apartments.&#xD;
" It is nothing, your Majesty ; only a sprained foot, that will&#xD;
be all right in a couple of days," said Inez, begging to go' to&#xD;
her own room.&#xD;
"Then, good-night," said the Empress, willing to gratify her.&#xD;
" You must not come down again; but how we shall miss you&#xD;
from our circle !"&#xD;
It was more than a week before Inez was able to take her&#xD;
place in the evening gatherings again; but the days of her&#xD;
confiement to her room were relieved by the visits of the&#xD;
EmpressL who -offered every attention to her favorite. And&#xD;

thdn, too, there were little messengers of flowers, and notes each&#xD;
daf from Giulian, telling her again and again how dear she&#xD;
was to him, and how dreary it was not to see her ; assurances&#xD;
-of devotion, that sent a pang to her heart, as she thought of&#xD;
hoW unworthy she was of such noble love. She resolved anew&#xD;
that she would be true to him; that he should never know&#xD;
that she sacrificed her own affection, nay, almost her own hope&#xD;
of jife's happiness, because she honored and respected him be-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
.HEPULTEPEC had been the royal residence for&#xD;
nearly one month. It was so near the .city, that it&#xD;
in no wise interfered with the weekly receptions, but&#xD;
rather gave to the Court gayeties a more varied and&#xD;
agre able character. The Emperor still held his state meetings&#xD;
at the national palace; but the evenings were always passed. at&#xD;
Chepultepec, which was truly a " pleasure palace."&#xD;
Summer had come, and breathed into the flowers the breath&#xD;
of lire, and all nature was alive with beauty.&#xD;
It was reception evening at the palace, and all the slite of&#xD;
the capital had come out for enjoyment.. The, grand band was&#xD;
plays g on the terrace in front of the castle, while the guests&#xD;
were gathering; but as the night closed, and the diawing-room&#xD;
were filled, the musicians were summoned within; that the&#xD;
dancing might begin. Within the dancing-room there gathered&#xD;
a ga assemblage ;. dark-eyed seijoritas and gallant hussars;&#xD;
dignied, duenna-like seiBoras, and stately dons; all enjoying the&#xD;
whirl of the mazy dance, either as participators or lookers-on.&#xD;
Many of the guests lingered in the half-deserted drawing-rooms '&#xD;
and about the open windows were groups of three or four des-&#xD;
canting upon the beauties of the night.&#xD;
Cpunt Isolam 1"said a merry-voiced maiden in one of these&#xD;
group, do you know, they say that in the garden there, down&#xD;
by the little fountain on the east, Montezuma's ghost walks&#xD;

to see it, though doubtless you have heard of its appearance!&#xD;
If I lived here at the castle, like Senorita Inez and yourself, I&#xD;
think his ghostship and I would grow quite intimate 1"&#xD;
"Are you quite sure, Seuorita Altandi, that it is Monte-&#xD;
zuma's ghost, or Dona Marina's? You know she betrayed him,&#xD;
by acting as guide to Cortez !."&#xD;
"Pray don't grow historic, Count! I am not sure of any-&#xD;
thing in that line; but I tell you again that Montezuma's ghost&#xD;
is to be seen in the garden, and as I know you are skeptical on&#xD;
the subject, you shall test the point for us this night., Go now&#xD;
to the marble fountain; stay there thirty minutes; you will then&#xD;
hear the chiming of the Cathedral bell striking ten. Come back,&#xD;
and tell us what you see -tell us that these unearthly spectres&#xD;
are not simply the hatchings of old women's fancies, and we&#xD;
shall be convinced.  There! does ndt that sound like. the&#xD;
.Cumaman sibyl? " she added gayly.&#xD;
They were standing in a group-Senorita Altandi, Senorita&#xD;
Gonzales, Count Isolani, Count Khevenhuller, and Captain&#xD;
Navarro.&#xD;
" What! senorita," said the Count in a voice of mock terror,&#xD;
" you will not surely send me alone? You yourself must ao.&#xD;
company me on this dangerous mission."&#xD;
"I? " said the girl, laughing. "Iventure with an unbe-&#xD;
liever into the presence of theunearthly? -I should not dare to.&#xD;
Count Khevenhuller - no, Senorita Gonzales, you too are an&#xD;
unbeliever ;.you must go with Count Isolani  We shall await&#xD;
your return here by the window."&#xD;
"No, no !" cried Inez nervously, as she turned to Giulian;&#xD;
".Captain Navarro can go; he can ward off danger with more&#xD;
power than I."&#xD;
"Inez, you must go," repeated the girl emphatically. "Cap-&#xD;
taint Navarro, you are willing to trust her to these unknown&#xD;
dangers, are you not?"&#xD;
"With such a knight to;guard her, Famn willing to trust her&#xD;
even with MAfontezuma's. ghost," said Giulian; turning to Count&#xD;
Isolani.&#xD;
TheCount had been silent. So unexpected an emergency had&#xD;
not resented itself to him when he had gayly made his'petition&#xD;
for a companion. While he dreaded to place himself in temp-&#xD;
tation's way, yet courtesy.demanded that he should not refuse.&#xD;
to have Inez accompany him. They were all waiting, and there&#xD;
was' no time left to hesitate, so Inez accepted Count -Isolani's&#xD;
offered-hand. " One moment, Count," cried the Sefiorita. "I&#xD;

It would not do for one moment that either should relax. tAnd&#xD;
in his soul Count Isolani thanked Inez that she rela him A&#xD;

" My heart is most willing, seiiorita," he rele  e-igy a&#xD;

&#xD;
greet it, "my heart is most willing: it is the memoryalone that&#xD;

" Then that treacherous memory must bear the punishment.&#xD;
Let it redeem itself now, or forever lose its trust. Let it show&#xD;
proof that some gem of poetry or prose given to its keeping in&#xD;
the past, has been faithfully guarded."&#xD;
Again there was silence in the garden -   silence, save the tink-&#xD;
ling voice of the silvery-toned fountain, and the soft cooings of&#xD;
the lonely night-bird in the plain below ; a magic silence, a&#xD;
moment of hushed quietude, when the moonbeams trembled as&#xD;
they glanced their timid beams upon the sleeping flowers, and&#xD;
the dew-drops nestled closer to the sheltering rose-leaves.&#xD;
The stillness was growing oppressive, and Inez again spoke.&#xD;
"Will you begin, Count Isolani? or has your poor memory&#xD;
forsworn its allegiance?"&#xD;
It was only a second now he hesitated; and then, as if moved&#xD;
by an impulse that he struggled against, and found himself power-&#xD;
less to overcome, he began in soft, melodious tones:&#xD;
" There are brighter dreams than those of Fame,&#xD;
which are the dreams of love ! Out of the heart&#xD;
Rises the bright ideal of these dreams,&#xD;
As from some woodland fount a spirit rises&#xD;
And sinks again into its silent depths&#xD;
Ere the enamor'd knight can touch her robe.&#xD;
'Tis this ideal that the soul of man,&#xD;
Like the enamor'd knight beside the fountain,&#xD;
waits for upon the margin of life's stream,&#xD;
Waits to behold her rise from the dark waters&#xD;
Cladin a mortalshape! Alas, how many&#xD;
Must wait in vain ! The stream flows evermore,&#xD;
But from its silent deeps no spirit rises!"&#xD;
He stood quite near her now so near, that she could feel,&#xD;
not hear, the deep, impassioned pathos in his voice, that told the&#xD;
echoes of the heart-beatings within.     She looked up, and the&#xD;
dark eyes met her own.      Out of their depths, filled with sad,&#xD;
despairing light, came the story of the love that his lips dare&#xD;
not avow.&#xD;
It was a fearful moment of trial. Count Isolani felt that the&#xD;
flood-gates which he had held down for months past with giant&#xD;
strength, which had stood firm    against the Marah waters =that&#xD;
had angrily lashed, and defiantly surged against them, were ris'&#xD;
ing now, and the bark of his honor was to be wrecked upon the&#xD;
sweeping current. He stood there to-night in this hour of great&#xD;
temptation, no stoic hero conquering his own soul;'he was&#xD;
only a son of the old Adam, tempted of the beautiful Eve he-&#xD;

There was a wild triumph- the exultation of a wicked fiend&#xD;
in his voice - as the passionate *ords fell from his lips.&#xD;
Inez started from his embrace, and for a moment her grief-&#xD;
stricken face was buried in her hands.&#xD;
"Victor! Victor Isolani " she cried at last, in tones of&#xD;
strange fierceness, "unsay those evil words! Let me believe&#xD;
yo~u still the same,;'--'true to~ thy honor, thyself,. and thy&#xD;
friend!"-&#xD;
Drop - drop, fell the water into the marble circle; drop -&#xD;
drop, go the sands through the hour-glass; and drop -drop,&#xD;
fall the tears from.the angel who is making the record of human&#xD;
weakness above.&#xD;
Yes ! there was an angel near, and it had spoken to Inez ;&#xD;
had given her power to save herself -to save the man she&#xD;
loved, in his hour of temptation.&#xD;
She reached out .her hand, and he held it in his own firm&#xD;
clasp. Softly the words came now, tenderly and soothingly,&#xD;
whispered,-&#xD;
"Vireo, my friend, my brother, this will not do ! Better&#xD;
to part forever, than know each other false! ",&#xD;
The struggle was over. She was triumphant now; and per-&#xD;
haps her victory was acknowledged as not the least gloriously&#xD;
won, by Him who marks each sorrow of His suffering children.&#xD;
"Inez," said the Count, as he knelt beside her, and pressed her&#xD;
hand to his lips, "my saviour, you have made me myself again!&#xD;
Go, 'forget - forgive! You are Giulian Navarro's; and God&#xD;
knows he is more worthy to. wear the jewel of your love than&#xD;
I! Victor Isolani prays God to give to you both happiness&#xD;
told u !"&#xD;
There was a tremor in his voice, a plaintive, hopeless sad-&#xD;
ness, that wrung the heart's core to hear. The youth was all.&#xD;
gone from his face as he looked up to her.&#xD;
"And may He keep you, Victor," she wispered, under&#xD;
the shallow of His wing, and may He send peace and comfort&#xD;
to your soul!"&#xD;
She was gone, and he was desolate!&#xD;
Alas! poor human souls ! Full of earthiness and clay, full&#xD;
of sin and cunning wickedness, lying in wait to betray us.&#xD;
Who shall cast the first stone? Oh, saintly Pharisee, undo&#xD;
thy cloak, and look within, ere the condemn ton of thy brother&#xD;
is pronounced. "Ye've aiblins no temptation." Take care that&#xD;

dew, confessed that the wraith had frightened her into desert-&#xD;
ing you; and she left you, trying to quiet M iontezuma's&#xD;
troubled spirit ; and so I was sent to see you safely in."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Giulian; let us leave this haunted fountain,"&#xD;
said the Count, with an effort at cheerfulness, that succeeded&#xD;
well. " Seu'orita Gonzales deserted me at a fearful moment ;&#xD;
and I am afraid my terror-stricken eye, and heart will bring&#xD;
back a meagre report for the Seuorita Altandi. Alh! here they&#xD;
are now -she and Count Khevenhuller by the window."&#xD;
Giunan did not notice the strange light in his friend's eye,&#xD;
his own heart was so - full of gladness ; else he would have be.&#xD;
lieved that Count Isolani had indeed seen visitors from  the&#xD;
spirit-land.&#xD;
"'False faithless knight !" exclaimed the Senorita Altandi,&#xD;
as they approached; "is it thus my commands are obeyed?&#xD;
Senorita Inez is found beside the Empress, and you linger or&#xD;
stroll out again into the garden. .Ah ! there must be penance&#xD;

dispose of yourself," she added, with an arch smile, nodding&#xD;
towards the adjoining parlor, where sat the Empress and her&#xD;
ladies.&#xD;
The dancing went on; but there was more than one who&#xD;
moved mechanically through the evening, who played her&#xD;
part in the comic tragedy, whose heart had no sympathy with&#xD;
the smiles of those around ; to whom, in all the joyous strains&#xD;
there was only one sad echo that filled the deepest. chambers&#xD;
of her soul:-&#xD;
"It might have been, it might have been I"&#xD;
Inez scarcely quitted Her Majesty's presence until the guests&#xD;
had departed. She was afraid to trust herself---afraid that&#xD;
she might lose the power to keep back the hand that-was tug-&#xD;
ging at her heart-strings.&#xD;
At last they were all gone, and she was in her chamber&#xD;
above, alone ! Blessed solitude ! where the sigh of the peni-&#xD;
-tent, and the prayer of the despairing may go forth unheard,&#xD;
*save~ by the One into whose ear it is breathed.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
OUNT ISOLIANI did not give his resolution to resign&#xD;
his position at the palace and leave t e capital, time to&#xD;
be shaken or changed -did not permit his heart to&#xD;
plead for mercy. He was afr id to listen to it,-afraid&#xD;
t extend one favor, lest it should bet ay him again.&#xD;
The morning after the reception e nng, that had marked&#xD;
self deeper than all others in his life calendar, he sought the&#xD;
Imperor's private cabinet, as was his wont.&#xD;
It was a trial that was before him, that took o small cour-&#xD;
age to meet; to ask the Emperor, still the dear friend of his-&#xD;
youth, still the " Maximilian " of old, in spite o his crown, to&#xD;
sekid him away'; and to be able to give scarcely a shadow of&#xD;
re son for the request. The Emperor -had given him the posi-&#xD;
tien as Secretary, that he might keep him near im, and now;&#xD;
tht he should, ask to give it up ! There had been no falling&#xD;
off in the friendship between the two since the coming to&#xD;
Mexico. Count Isolani knew all the pleasures, the hopes and&#xD;
ambitions, or the perplexities and annoyances, th' t lodged with&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
the Emperor; and Maximilian, in turn, had the key that opened&#xD;
to him, the chambers of his friend's soul; opened at his bidding&#xD;
all save one, into which Count Isolani scarcely dared look&#xD;
himself, and which he trusted he had sealed up now, forever.&#xD;
Often, after his duties were performed, would the Count&#xD;
remain with the Emperor, and the two together would go back&#xD;
to that sunny period, that seemed now so far ,off, when, with&#xD;
youthful hearts filled with poetic sentiment, rose-colored dreams&#xD;
and buoyant hopes, they had sailed out from Trieste on their&#xD;
first voyage, and then over the blue waters of the Mediterranean,&#xD;
past "old Egina's rock," to where high Hymettus looks upon&#xD;
the classic plain; and again, in later years, when they stood on&#xD;
the deck of the Eizabeth, and viewed for the first time the broad&#xD;
Atlantic, over whose rolling waves they were bearing onward&#xD;
to the Brazilian shores. All this was pleasure; but for the&#xD;
present the tie must be broken; he must go away, or he should&#xD;
prove himself unworthy to stand by Maximilian or by any&#xD;
honest man's side. To stay here, he knew that he could not&#xD;
conquer his love for Inez Gonzales. He could not see her day&#xD;
after day, and know that she loved him, and keep silent. He&#xD;
must go, until she was Giulian's.&#xD;
He had finished his writing, and his heart misgave him as&#xD;
he rose to go. The Emperor still sat by the table, and as he&#xD;
looked up, and caught sight of the troubled expression that&#xD;
rested on the Count's face, he exclaimed, -&#xD;
" Isolani, what has gotten into you of late? You are getting&#xD;
as mopy and taciturn as an 'owl; I hardly know you for the&#xD;
friend of old. Don't hurry away this morning, unless you&#xD;
have engagements to call you. We shall not be interrupted,&#xD;
and I think we can benefit each other by an hour's interchange&#xD;
of thought. Is there anything going wrong with you, Isolani,&#xD;
that I can remedy?"&#xD;
"No, no, your Highness," - Count Isolani cling to the old&#xD;
name,--"only I am just turning over in mymni1d petition I&#xD;
am  going to make," he added, as he sat down again, "which&#xD;
will seem very strange; but necessity presses- us sometimes&#xD;
quite to the wall, and leaves but one way to escape."&#xD;
"What 'is it?" said Maximilian. "Unto the half. of my&#xD;
kingdom will I grant your requests; only don't ask that I&#xD;
shall sergd you as a Minister anywhere, for you know there is&#xD;
no such word as 'parting' between you and me."&#xD;
4"Ah!l there is a spirit of divination near us," said the&#xD;
Count, with an effort at cheerfulness. " I have been thinkig&#xD;

wl at an idler ITam in the field, and I want to tae a new role,&#xD;
fo a while at least. Will your Majesty permit me enter the&#xD;
' line,' to join Gen. Meija at Oajaca, where I can see something&#xD;
of active service ? " In spite -of his assumed arelessness as&#xD;
he put the request, there was an earnestness abo t his manner&#xD;
thtt Maximilian quickly discerned.&#xD;
'Isolani! " he exclaimed, "what does this me n?  Are you&#xD;
not serving me where youare, as no one else c uld ?  There&#xD;
are, soldiers enough in the field to take care of  exico. Wait&#xD;
until, the United States threatens us more, and hen you can&#xD;
go ut with me, where you have ever been -[by  y side. Un-&#xD;
less there is some other reason, some positive nec ssity for this&#xD;
cha  e, recall your.request. I can refuse you  othing; but,&#xD;
Isolni, I cannot give' you up- easily. When I 1 ok into your&#xD;
faced and grasp your hand, with its firm pressure, know there&#xD;
is ohe friend who will be true to death, -it may ot be so with&#xD;
others about us, -the old German love cannot be rooted-out."&#xD;
"Your Highness is right," said the Count, wi h deep feel-&#xD;
ing; "this German heart will beat true to the la t; and there&#xD;
is not a drop of blood in these veins that I hold to precious to&#xD;
be shed for the Empress Carlotta and yourself. You have&#xD;
never yet found me failing, but now -there is a  ecessity for&#xD;
this petition. I cannot mock my heart, your   ighness, by&#xD;
holding dip to you its weakness. I blush to ow to you the&#xD;
only thing kept back in all our years of confi once. It is&#xD;
a conon story of 'loving too late;' the old chant -&#xD;
"'Had we never met, and never parted,&#xD;
We had ne'er been broken-hearted."'&#xD;
"$ did not think possible that I could be tem ted to love&#xD;
the betrothed of another, and went on, like the pre-adamite&#xD;
Soli ,an trusting too much to the power within, ti 1, like him,&#xD;
the awakening came, and there was not even hope eft behind.&#xD;

fashio. of the mourners there, to pray with the ha d upon the&#xD;

Th~ Count paused, and leaned his&amp;amp; head upon his hand. -&#xD;
"  riend," said Maximilian, almost tenderly,  ,he camne&#xD;
and stpod by his side, " I see it all! And it is the o ly love of&#xD;
your life ! God help you!. Time - Time, is a grea physician,&#xD;

&#xD;
give you up now till this shall pass away, but then,-you will&#xD;
come back?"&#xD;
"God bless you, my friend, my Emperor," said the Count,&#xD;
grasping his hand, and standing face to face. "One more favor,&#xD;
and I have finished. You will take Captain Navarro - he is a&#xD;
noble{ soldier -in my place.?"&#xD;
" No one can fill your place, Isolani," said Maximilian, " and&#xD;
you are to come back when I recall you. Navarro is a gal-&#xD;
lant soldier, and shall not be forgotten.. When do you desire&#xD;
to leave?"&#xD;
"At once -to-morrow, if possible."&#xD;
"Then I will give you a letter to General Meija. I could not&#xD;
give you to better keeping. .Come to me here again to-night,&#xD;
for I think there may be many words of courage and strength&#xD;
that we haVe left unsaid to each other. 'Do you remember how&#xD;
we used to comfort each other, and philosophize in those good&#xD;
old days?  AM   Isolani, we are older men now, and the ,hills&#xD;
of life' seem not quite so green, and the golden shadows that&#xD;
crept down the sunny slopes come forward no longer to meet&#xD;
us; but I think there is manliness enough yet in our hearts,&#xD;
to help us bid defiance to these giants that meet us on the way.&#xD;
If we give up, we shall find ourselves bound with cable cords."&#xD;
Count Isolani had risen to go, but he stopped again long&#xD;
enough to press the Emperor's hand, and only trusted himself&#xD;
to say, "I will come to-night ! " and then closed the door behind&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Count Isolani was gone, and his presence was missed at Che-&#xD;
pultepec  missed sorely by one heart that tried in vain to deny&#xD;
the void it felt ; that tried in vain to think of his nobility and&#xD;
self-sacrifice without feeling the warm, beatings of love, in the&#xD;
admiration that was a lawful tribute.&#xD;
When was this war and strife to end between love and&#xD;
duty ?  One or the other must yield, and it must be the former.&#xD;
There must be an end; and Inez hardly dared toconfess the&#xD;
shudder with which she thought of the event that would make&#xD;
this loving and dreaming sinful;'--sinful it was. now, but it&#xD;
would be doubly so when she was Giulian's wife.&#xD;
Giulian was growing anxious about her ; he said "she was&#xD;
so silent of late;" and he did not dream of the burden she&#xD;
bore. But he was so tender and- kind, so noble and true, per-&#xD;
hiaps he would teach her as his wife to. love him. The other&#xD;
had gone away to forget her ; it was right ; and she must for-&#xD;

get too. She could do it better as Giulian's wife; so at last she&#xD;
began to listen to his pleadings, and beside the same fountain&#xD;
in the garden, with the quiet moonlight looking upon them,&#xD;
just as it had done on the two'who buried thei love there, out&#xD;
of sight for ever, they believed, Inez promise that with the&#xD;
New Year she would walk the path with Giulian. She would&#xD;
not keep his true heart waiting longer ; her dead father's bless-&#xD;
yng rested upon' their vows, and surely his spit would hover&#xD;
near them, and keep them from unhappiness in the future.&#xD;
CHAPTER. XXVIII.&#xD;
HILE Mexico was fast rising and increasing in&#xD;
strength and dignity, and overawing. ler enemies, the&#xD;
war between her mighty neighbors, the Northern and&#xD;
Southern States of the Republic, hac been kept up&#xD;
with unchanged determination and unfinching resolve on the&#xD;
part of -each.&#xD;
'The'South had seceded from the Federal Union upon the&#xD;
principle of State Sovereignty, as"she understood it to be em-&#xD;
bodied in the Constitution. She relied and icted upon the&#xD;
r onviction, that she was not infringing .by secession, in the&#xD;
slightest degree, the rights of the Northern section; and she did&#xD;
ot believe that they would use coercive measures to preserve&#xD;
Union " that was such, only in name. Though she had&#xD;
hoped to be permitted to depart in peace, yet when the issue at&#xD;
rms came, she did not shrink from the conflict, fearful as"it&#xD;
promised to be; for it took no extraordinary powers of clair-&#xD;
voyance to foresee the horrors that were to cone. Calling her&#xD;
sons from every hill and valley, she bade them look to the ban-&#xD;
ner she held aloft; it was to be a new emble  of liberty to&#xD;
them, and it must not trail in the dust.&#xD;
The crisis came; and upon the plains of Vir ia two armies&#xD;
were drawn up in battle array. The dove of  eace, that had&#xD;
hovered so long over a prosperous land, was s ,artled with the&#xD;
(booming of cannon, the clanging of sabres, and he fierce neigh'&#xD;
ing of the war-horse in battle. It was in the q iet of the July&#xD;
morn that she took her flight, and1 the strife be an.  '--&#xD;
&#xD;
"Steel clanging sounds onsteel; helmets are flashed on high ;&#xD;
blood bursts; and smoke around."  Brave men met there at&#xD;
Manassas; and it was "Greek to Greek." When the sun was sets&#xD;
ting amid the smoke of battle, there went up the shout of vic-&#xD;
tory from the soldiers of the Confederacy ; they had won the day.&#xD;
But the moon looked down upon the ghastly picture of a blood-&#xD;
stained field, strewn with dead and dying; together they lay, side&#xD;
by side, gray jackets and blue ; and the angel of Death watched&#xD;
beside them both. But the day was won for the South ; and the&#xD;
success to her arms served perhaps to give undue elation to her&#xD;
troops, and they began to underrate the skill and prowess of the&#xD;
enemy.. Southern statesmen, too, in fancy saw the Confederacy&#xD;
firmly established, recognized by all the world as a nation, and&#xD;
beginning at once to press onward with giant strides to glory&#xD;
and to power. Alas ! it was but Hope's dream of the Future!&#xD;
The defeat of the-Grand Army of the United States at .Manas-&#xD;
sas, was a thunder peal that startled the whole North into ac-&#xD;
tion. "West Point veterans overcome ! The invincible army&#xD;
driven to the gates of the capital itself ! The Rebellion not&#xD;
crushed at a single blow ! To arms ! to arms ! "&#xD;
Then, in truth, did it come to the nation that it was War ---&#xD;
unsparing, unmerciful, devastating War -whose brazen shield&#xD;
bears the strange and solemn device of a new-made   ave ;&#xD;
whose tribute is a broken heart; whose triumph is over deso-&#xD;
late homes ; and whose train is filled with weeping women and&#xD;
orphaned children, -this was the monster it looked upon, and&#xD;
to him yielded the sceptre ; and truly he began to reign like a&#xD;
king. ' Battle succeeded battle; brave men fell, and their lace&#xD;

was retrieved by a victory in Virginia, and for a time the scales&#xD;
of Fate seemed equally balanced. When the "Stars 'and Bars"&#xD;
crossed the Potomac, and startled thLe quaint old farmers of&#xD;
Pennsylvania, Southern matrons in Kentucky and Tennessee&#xD;
trembled at the approach of Yankee cavalry. Weeks, months&#xD;
and years slipped along, and with neither army did the goddess&#xD;
of victory take up her fixed abode. Devoted spirits fought and&#xD;
fell, defending the banner so dear to their hearts and with their&#xD;
latest breath, commended their country and their comrades to&#xD;
the God that "judgeth between right and wrong."&#xD;
In her enthusiasm and firm determination, the 'South at the&#xD;

when she found her armies depleted by sicknes and death, she&#xD;
did not falter, but in great, god-like faith, s uggled on and&#xD;
hoped on In reviewing that four-years' confli t, which stands&#xD;
out as an era in the nineteenth century, is t ere one, be it&#xD;
friend or foe, who will refuse to accord the tri ute of bravery&#xD;
a  devotion to a people haplessly fallen?  ith every port&#xD;
bockaded by the -iron-clad steamers of the eneny, whose deadly&#xD;
cannon threatened destruction to the little barks that now and&#xD;
then dared their vigilance and gained the open  a; cut off from&#xD;
all foreign intercourse; compelled to feed, clot e, and arm her&#xD;
soldiers and her people by her own resources,  as may be sup-&#xD;
posed, the South permitted no talent to re ain idle. The&#xD;
proudest uniform of the Southern soldier wa the gray jeans,&#xD;
that loving hands, perhaps, had woven; and the simple home-&#xD;
spun dress was seen on beautiful women, who had graced the&#xD;
most brilliant drawing-rooms of the land. At first, all was&#xD;
buoyancy and hope. Wives and maidens toiled and prayed,&#xD;
while husbands and fathers fought and died. Again and again&#xD;
the ranks ,of the armies were filled from those in reserve;&#xD;
again and again did the' cry come for "more men."&#xD;
And thecall was met.  Yes! met by old men, whose locks&#xD;
were tinged by the frosts of many winters, and by the beardless&#xD;
boy with the dew of youth upon his cheek. Things were grow-&#xD;
ing desperate with the Confederacy. The North had the whole&#xD;
of Europe to which she could look for men and arms ; the&#xD;
South, but a few impoverished states. Though the nations&#xD;
across the water wondered and marvelled that she should sus-&#xD;
tain herself so -nobly; though they applauded the chivalry of&#xD;
her sons and wept with her over her fallen heroes,- yet they&#xD;
kept back the words that would have made her a nation; the&#xD;
hand that could have saved her was not stretched forth.&#xD;
It had not been the burnings of ambition, not the martial&#xD;
anthem, "Go where glory waits thee," that brought the South-&#xD;
ern heart to action, -it was the solemn chanting of a deeper,&#xD;
holier strain and in the din of battle it was not lost,&#xD;
"Fight for the green graves of your sires,&#xD;
God, and your native land !"&#xD;
But this unequal struggle could not last long. At the be-&#xD;
gnigof the fourth year of the war, the truth came home,&#xD;
thtwhen- a soldier fell there was no other to take his place.'&#xD;
Mothers had seen their Spartan sons, one after another, brought&#xD;
home on blood-stained shields; and now there were no more to&#xD;

&#xD;
go or come. The soldiers were not giants, and despite their&#xD;
deeds of valor were but human, after all. And then, too, Pom-&#xD;
pey could not stamp his foot and raise his magic legions.&#xD;
As the spring of 1865 advanced, the soldiers of the North&#xD;
drew closer and closer around the devoted country and her&#xD;
defenders. The Southern army held out, stout and brave; but&#xD;
the daring raids effected by the Northern cavalry in: the South-&#xD;
west, destroying powder-mills, factories, store-houses of corn&#xD;
and cotton, marking their path with desolation and ruin, took&#xD;
the hope from the heart of the strongest. Starvation looked&#xD;
the people in the face. Want of arms, and the.facilities with&#xD;
which to make them destroyed, left the soldiers powerless.&#xD;
Seeing all these horrors that faced them, and knowing that&#xD;
it was useless to struggle against such' fearful odds; his wagon&#xD;
train cut off; his men hemmed in, and in danger of being cut&#xD;
to pieces by the advancing enemy under General Grant, - the&#xD;
noble veteran commander of the Confederate forces in Virginia,&#xD;
ROBERT E. LEE, whose gray hairs might droop beneath the&#xD;
weight of glory that rests upon them, after holding a council&#xD;
of war with his officers, determined upon an honorable sur-&#xD;
render,; and upon the ninth of April, 1865, the two armies&#xD;
were drawn forth upon the plains, and for the last time the&#xD;
sunlight fell upon the uplifted bayonets of the Southern sol-&#xD;
diers.&#xD;
If - the spirits of Caesar, of Bonaparte, of Washington, of&#xD;
Albert Sidney, Johnson, and Stonewall Jackson, military&#xD;
heroes, ancient and modern, were permitted to look down upon&#xD;
that scene at Appomattox Court-house, where, facing each&#xD;
other, stood the conqueror and the conquered: the one generous,&#xD;
though victorious; the other proud, though failing - when the&#xD;
sword of the hero was returned from the hand of the victor,&#xD;
and he was told that "he was worthy to wear it," did not the&#xD;
echo come from their spirit voices, " Well done, good and&#xD;
faithful servant"?  Aye, well done, living heroes and fallen&#xD;
martyrs . .&#xD;
And so the star of the "Confederate States of America"&#xD;
sank beneath the horizon, and it was proclaimed a "1Lost&#xD;
Cause."  Confederate banners, that had perhaps- ofttimes&#xD;
waved in triumph, were folded. Silently, tenderly, and tear-&#xD;
fully they were laid away, and in Memory's garden was&#xD;
p anted a shaft, enduring as Time itself, towering above all&#xD;
other stones of record, and. graven simply, "JBlium fuit /"&#xD;
and mourning hearts each year make pilgrimage to this shrine,&#xD;

and offer there, the libation of tears and sighs, over hopes&#xD;
buried beneath.&#xD;
The 24th of April, each year is observed as a " memorial day "&#xD;
to the Confederate dead throughout the entire South, and a,&#xD;
tribute of wreaths, garlands, and flowers is placed upon the&#xD;
grave of every Southern soldier. - - -.-&#xD;
We measure centuries by decades, into which fall events&#xD;
both great and small. One after another they pass away, and&#xD;
men, empires, and kingdoms are buried with them. The years&#xD;
stretching from  1860 to 1870 are likely to form an epoch,&#xD;
that shall stand out in bold relief in the record of the nine-&#xD;
teenth century, as giving birth on the American continent, to.&#xD;
two new governments, which at first seemed to bask alike in the&#xD;
smiles of fortune.&#xD;
A mysterious turning of the balances:-'one went down, as we&#xD;
have seen; "the o.other -the Empire of Mexico "'-its for-&#xD;
tunes the reader is still following.&#xD;
Perhaps there is not a more appropriate occasion offered for&#xD;
an historic, political, and moral retrospection than the funeral&#xD;
oration of a fallen government. When the fury of the storm.&#xD;
is past, those that stand upon the beach can see the frowning&#xD;
reefs, the whirling maelstrom, that drove the gallant ship&#xD;
asunder ; and perhaps they think it well there should be a&#xD;
light in future on the rocky height, that shall be seen, even amid&#xD;
the blackness of the midnight tempest, by the tossing bark.&#xD;
Let the statesmen of the United States build now that light-&#xD;
house, for the Ship of State is not yet saved.&#xD;
Let them learn from the old Romans, that the greatness of a&#xD;
country must be founded upon national virtue; for they find&#xD;
that the problem, as to'which is "the best and most enduring&#xD;
form of government," which the Republic of the United States&#xD;
claimed to have answered, is still unsolved. Rousseau gave to&#xD;
the nations a beautiful system, yet none have been able to put&#xD;
it in practice: "Trouver une forme d'association par laquelle&#xD;
chacun s'unissent a tous, n'obeisse pourtant qu'7t lui-meme et reste&#xD;
aussi qu'auparavant." *  And then, too, the poet, has set an&#xD;
easier method and an easier answer :&#xD;
"For forms of government, let fools contest ;&#xD;
Whatever is best administered is best."&#xD;
And we are inclined to fall into the sentiment of the couplet&#xD;
* "Find a form of society according to which each one uniting himself into the whole,&#xD;
~han obey himself only, and remain free as before."&#xD;
&#xD;
in viewing the political status of the kingdoms of the earth, in&#xD;
the nineteenth century.&#xD;
When the Confederacy fell, the shout went up, " that the&#xD;
Union was restored;" but the South calls to the shades of the&#xD;
departed patriots to bear witness to the mockery of the words.&#xD;
She laid down her arms ipn true faith, yet she retained her&#xD;
rights as immutable. She would not see her sons made "hewers&#xD;
of wood and drawers of water; " and so she stood in silence,&#xD;
with the bayonet at her breast, and wondered where was the&#xD;
truth in the words that rang out, " The Union is restored ! "&#xD;
In spite of the oppression, the prejudice and passion, the&#xD;
usurpation of power, that every day shakes the Government to&#xD;
its foundation, yet true, hearts -listen to the silent teachings&#xD;
of reason. They believe that God has pronounced the destiny&#xD;
of the United States; it is to be a Union. They believe that the&#xD;
day of scourging is to pass ; that the sea of politics, which is&#xD;
h       now seething and foaming in surging billows, must be quieted&#xD;
at the bidding of a master-spirit, whose command, " Peace ! be&#xD;
still," shall lull the waves to rest. A second Washington must&#xD;
come. All patriots are not gone from us, we trust. To do away&#xD;
with sectional distinctions, to still the clamor for party rights&#xD;
and benefits, and to inculcate in the hearts of the people the&#xD;
great precept, "A kingdom divided against itself must fall," -&#xD;
this must be done before, in truth, the shout may go up, "A&#xD;
Union restored, -glorious and prosperous!"    "But is this&#xD;
ever to be ?"  So ask they who look with trembling at the&#xD;
Cimmerian darkness of the political-sky, where glimmers no ray&#xD;
of roseate light to herald the coming of the day. In answer,&#xD;
we remember that,&#xD;
"Truth crushed to earth will riseagain,&#xD;
The eternal years of God are hers."&#xD;
And in the meantime, in the midst of anarchy, strife, and&#xD;
schism, the patriot, whose voice is lost in the tumult, can but&#xD;
hug to his heart the memory of those honest forefathers, who,&#xD;
hoping against everything, while right was their. bulwark of&#xD;
defence, at last were victorious. Let him remember this, and&#xD;
lift up his voice again; for though the South has no influence&#xD;
in the council of the nations, though she is shut 'out from the&#xD;
legislative halls, let her continue to cry aloud against the&#xD;
usurpation of the rights of the nation, for the "distant echoes&#xD;
of Liberty will send a thrill even through the hearts of her&#xD;
murderers."&#xD;

of the United States is unchangeable ; is all-su  cient and com-&#xD;
plete. Our Country, our history, bears no record of the occasion'&#xD;
when it was found wanting in power to meet an emergency.&#xD;
That men may set it aside, or soi-disant statesmen may attempt&#xD;
to amend it, does not reflect upon it; though' the waves of&#xD;

will at last roll in quiet, at the base of an A arat, on which&#xD;
rests this Ark of American hope and greatness.&#xD;
But we have left the April sun of 1865 looking upon the&#xD;
grave of the Confederacy. In sadness and great grief had her&#xD;
defenders seen her buried, looked abroad upon their ruined&#xD;
country, and had all gone away to desolate homes. Among&#xD;
the many who had striven for the South, there were some who&#xD;
felt, in the anguish of their hearts, that they could not see&#xD;
their beautiful land, once so full of glory, clad in sackcloth&#xD;
and ashes, mourning like Rachel of Rama ; they felt that&#xD;
voluntary exile, bitter though it was, would be preferable to&#xD;
seeing strangers, that felt- no grief; mocking them in their&#xD;
despair. To these, Mexico, so full of adventure and enterprise,&#xD;
lthe young empire, rich in energy and resource, a d the unusual&#xD;
inducements of the noble young Emperor Maxinilian to induce&#xD;
immigration, seemed to offer a home, and th therward they&#xD;
turned their faces ; and as they bade adieu o their loved&#xD;
South, and floated over the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, they&#xD;
whispered to their stricken hearts,&#xD;
"Let Fate do her worst: there are relics of joy,&#xD;
Bright dreams of the past, she cannot destroy ;&#xD;
-  They come in the night-time of sorrow and careI&#xD;
And bring back the features that joy used to wear.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
N a private apartment of the San Carlos Hotel, at the&#xD;
Mexican capital, was gathered a little assemblage, rep-&#xD;
resentatives of the late Confederacy. Men, they were&#xD;
a who, in the forum and on the field, had right stanchly&#xD;
and boldly defended their country, and who, now that words&#xD;
and swords had proven alike of no avail, had journeyed to&#xD;
Mexico, a land rich in promise of future greatness, and for the&#xD;
present blessed with a ruler who, though young in years, seemed&#xD;
possessed of the wisdom and judgment of an experienced mon-&#xD;
arch.&#xD;
These men had come hither seeking a home; they had started&#xD;
in life, as it were afresh, bearing within brave, manly hearts,&#xD;
that would not shrink from difficulties and privations. - They&#xD;
would, if need be, found a colony in the deep recess of the for-&#xD;
est, or the wildest jungle-haunt, so that they might be per-&#xD;
mitted to call the work' of their hands their own, and them-&#xD;
selves freemen. At even-tide, resting beneath the shade of&#xD;
their own vine and fig-tree, they could breathe the air of free-&#xD;
dom; and though in the stillness of the twilight the lonely notes&#xD;
of the whip-poor-will, or the soft-toned strainsof the Philomela,&#xD;
would call up sad memories of what "mighthave been for their&#xD;
country," yet there would be comfort in the reflection that they&#xD;
would be spared the sight of her future suffering.&#xD;
No, no !  They could not linger weeping beside the tomb;&#xD;
or the whole South was one vast sepulchral urn, in which&#xD;
rested the sacred ashes of her Spartan sons. Let others who&#xD;
were gifted with greater powers of endurance, who could look to&#xD;
the future with faith, who could believe inthe resurrection of&#xD;
liberty, let them 'stay as silent watchers; but they could not&#xD;
witness the ghoul-like revel of army officials and traitorous sons&#xD;
over the corpse of the motherland.&#xD;
They did not love their country less because they had left&#xD;
her. Every spot of ground from the Potomac to the Rio Grande,&#xD;
was dear to their hearts; and then they had not gone entirely:&#xD;
there was a singing to the southern clime; they were in Mexico,&#xD;
just over the river,- where the gentle breeze, laden with the&#xD;
aromatic sweetness of the orange-groves, might bear onward a&#xD;

It was with such feeling animating their earts that each&#xD;
man looked into the other's face, at the co ference on that&#xD;
August morning.&#xD;
The windows of the room in which they met, looked down&#xD;
upon a stone-paved street, and it was a strange sight to those&#xD;
ew Confederate soldiers who stood gazing out, to see the squads&#xD;
pf mounted horsemen, whose bright uniforms blazed in the&#xD;
hun, as they cast a glance up and caught sight of tlhe gray&#xD;
jackets, touch their hats in respect as they passed, and shout&#xD;
half aloud; "Vive la Confederacy ! " and it wa a sad sigh that&#xD;
same from their hearts as .,they turned in t listen to their&#xD;
leaders, who had begun the business of the mo ning.&#xD;
In a large arm-chair, near "a table covered  ith green baize&#xD;
that occupied the centre of the room, was tha veteran officer,&#xD;
wh o never laid aside his uniform,-- General S erling Price, of&#xD;
issouri. His hair, tinged with gray, lay with careless grace&#xD;
pon the open forehead ; and the deep lines in he bronzed face&#xD;
tld of the same spirit still within, that made the man ever a&#xD;
ero.&#xD;
On his right was one who, in the palmy days of the "old'&#xD;
olunteer State," had been pointed to, by the Tennesseans with&#xD;
p ;de as their leader; - one, who had trod the granite halls in&#xD;
their capital in the proud consciousness of rectitude and ability;&#xD;
whose resistless eloquence, whether employed  political can-&#xD;

sell-bound. The star of Isham G. Harris, tho gh obscured by&#xD;
t e clouds of to-day, has not yet set; the hour will come again&#xD;
when he shall be needed.&#xD;
Occupying seats about the table, were other whose familiar&#xD;

a  , Governor Reynolds of Missouri, Genera Magruder, and&#xD;
la t though not least,- Lieutenant Maury, o naval renown.&#xD;
A ound them were grouped the soldiers, in their old gray&#xD;
ur iforms, who had followed their leaders (acting as escort) to this&#xD;

"Gentlemen, said he, " we haveat last reached. our destin.&#xD;
ation. We are in the City of Mexico; and the time has come when&#xD;
we are to leave off planning, and go to working for our future.&#xD;
We came here to seek homes for the families we have left be-.&#xD;
hind. We' are one ; our sympathies are one, and our interests&#xD;
the same. There must, therefore, be- no formality, no false&#xD;
reticence, in this our first meeting. The business before us is&#xD;
the same. The gracious young Emperor here, offers unusual&#xD;
facilities to emigrants, and though we have not yet seen his&#xD;
Majesty, we cannot doubt his sincerity. It is for-us, gentlemen,&#xD;
to determine upon the mode in which to commence action. It&#xD;
is necessary for us; to remember, that in order to have strength&#xD;
we must work together. Our purpose is to found, and iden-&#xD;
tify if possible, an American colony ; to settle in some fertile&#xD;
district, and to invite all true hard-working men in the South&#xD;
who feel inclined, to join us. Let us therefore, this morning,&#xD;
draft our resolutions, set forth our plans, and appoint a. com-&#xD;
mittee to submit them to his gracious Majesty, the Emperor,&#xD;
for approval and endorsement. Let us hear, gentlemen, your&#xD;
individual views upon the subject in which all are so deeply&#xD;
interested."&#xD;
General Price was the next to .speak, and he set forth his&#xD;
ideas in a brief, yet pointed, manner.&#xD;
".While we heartily concur in the sentiments of our brother,"&#xD;
said he, "it suggests itself to me, that perhaps the best and&#xD;
surest plan would be to see his Majesty first, and to learn the&#xD;
feelings of the,Emperor towards us from himself in person, be-&#xD;
fore going any further. Doubtless he will greatly facilitate our&#xD;
purposes by his advice; and it would be well enough to send&#xD;
our petition to-day, requesting an audience at the palace, at as&#xD;
early a date as possible."&#xD;
Acting upon this suggestion, the petition was at once drawn&#xD;
up, and sent to the Grand Chamberlain at the palace, and the&#xD;
conference of the morning ended.&#xD;
The Court was at Chepultepec, but the Emperor signified,&#xD;
through a polite note from his Secretary, the pleasure it would&#xD;
give him to receive the ' gentlemen from the South, at the&#xD;
national palace in the city the next day.&#xD;
The following morning, at the appointed hour, the committee,&#xD;
which consisted of the gentlemen before named repaired to the&#xD;
palace, and were shown into the spacious and elegant audience-&#xD;
chamber, which had been fitted up, when the Emper-or&#xD;

covered with crimson silk damask, on whic  at intervals was&#xD;
richly embroidered in gold, the Mexican coat of arms, and the&#xD;
Emperor's motto, "Equidad enjustia."&#xD;
The Emperor and Empress were seated on  sofa, at one side.&#xD;
year the former was the Minister of State, Ramirez ; and on the&#xD;
left of the Empress was.Rabeles, Minister of Fomento.*,&#xD;
As the marshal of the household announced by name as&#xD;
hey entered, each member of the committee, the Emperor, ris-&#xD;
g, extended his hand, and in turn, presented each to the&#xD;
impress, who greeted them with a kindly wcrd of welcome.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said Maximilian, "I cann t express to you&#xD;
the very great pleasure it gives us to see y:u in our capital.&#xD;
Though you come hither, as you think, strangers, you are not&#xD;
nknown. The devotion, the truth, and the fidelity of the&#xD;

is gone; and now it is the sound of the axe, wielded by the&#xD;
sinewy arm, that is our task ; to build a new temple, where we&#xD;
may worship and live in peace.&#xD;
« I have said this, your Majesty," continued the speaker,&#xD;
"that our purpose in coming to the Empire of Mexico night&#xD;
be understood and appreciated; that it might be known that&#xD;
we do not come -as brokendown warriors or statesmen, to&#xD;

who simply desire a -home, where they may enjoy liberty and&#xD;
quietude; which blessings, your Majesty, none can appreciate&#xD;
properly, until they feel their loss."&#xD;
As Governor Harris finished these impressive and out-&#xD;
spoken utterances of a brave heart, a smile, half sad with sym-&#xD;
pathy, flitted across the face of the beautiful Empress. She&#xD;
rose, and extended her hand to the speaker.&#xD;
"Your Majesty," said she, turning to the Emperor, " we do&#xD;
indeed honor the cause which had such men enlisted under its&#xD;
banner; and these gentlemen may be assured- of our deepest&#xD;

dressing herself with a bright smile to the Commissioners, "is&#xD;
waiting to aid you. We have sorely felt the need of the creative&#xD;
principle in Mexico;--those who understand that it is national&#xD;

"Our fair Empress is right," said the Emperor, "as indeed&#xD;
she always is. The plan of an American colony has been our&#xD;
favorite scheme since the fall of the Confederacy; and we shall&#xD;
be well pleased to see it on the road to fulfilment. - The har-&#xD;

gentlemen, are doubtless as well acquainted with the history of&#xD;
this nation as myself, and can understand that the position of&#xD;
its ruler is no sinecure. The Empress Carlotta has' labored&#xD;
with me, since our first arrival, to build up here such a govern-&#xD;
ment as Mexico deserves,- Civilization is a word of broad sig-&#xD;

and purpose for our country, - a struggle to wake up all the&#xD;

W knew that the way for this to be accomp shed, was not to&#xD;
iss e laws,- against which, perhaps, the perv rseness of human&#xD;
na ure would lead the people to rebel, -bu to appeal to the,&#xD;
motive power ; to create in the mind the ye ring desire for&#xD;
ad ancement and progression. History taught us long ago,&#xD;
that all developments of the internal man tend to the profit of&#xD;
so iety. . We have been endeavoring, during the year past, to&#xD;
sow good seed in the hearts of our people; first, by religious&#xD;
an  educational influences, and then by fostering a love of lit-&#xD;

and art. The reward may not come to this generation, but we&#xD;
sh 11 be content, if the harvest comes at last. We have ex-&#xD;
pr ssed ourselves thus to you, gentlemen, knowing that if you&#xD;
remain with us, we shall be allies in this gveat work. And&#xD;
now to the consideration of your colonial plans. We have-Gov-&#xD;

Lieutenant Maury was at once, mentioned as the chief com-&#xD;
nmissioner for this task of surveying ; and the minor points of&#xD;
the undertaking were discussed between the Emperor and him-&#xD;
sdlf, while the EImpress gave her attention to the others. The&#xD;
two ministers, who had hitherto kept silent, now took a lively&#xD;
psrt in the conversation. The Empress, who was unsurpassed&#xD;
in ready wit and sprightliness of mind, by her delicate tact&#xD;
dispelled all restraint, and the interview assumed an easy,&#xD;
embarrassed tone.&#xD;
An hour passed in pleasant exchange of sentiment; and the&#xD;
party had almost forgotten they were in the presence of royalty,&#xD;
nd therefore amenable to court etiquette.&#xD;
The solemn convent bells renfinded them th y had struck the&#xD;
h ur thrice since they had entered the palace and so they rose&#xD;
Once to leave. The Empress stopped then for a moment&#xD;
I cannot forbear," said she, "making one request, and grati-&#xD;
fyig a desire I have long felt. Though we have been near&#xD;
&#xD;
CRO WY JEWELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
253&#xD;
&#xD;
neighbor to the Confederate States for many months, yet I&#xD;
have never seen a bill issued by their Government."&#xD;
Anticipating her Majesty's request, General Price had taken&#xD;
from his breast a little package, and dropping the wrapping&#xD;
that enfolded it, unfurled a tiny silk Confederate flag.     From&#xD;
its folds fell one of those bills, issued with so much faith and&#xD;
hope in the ability to redeem the promise it bore upon its face.&#xD;
" Your Majesty," said the old General, as he handed the scrap&#xD;
of paper to her, "anything that is connected with the Confed-&#xD;
eracy is dear to my heart, and that little waif is a precious&#xD;
souvenir. I ask no worthier shroud than this uniform of un-&#xD;
pretending gray ; and as the scars on this well-nigh worn-out&#xD;
form were received in the service of the South; may her ban-&#xD;
ner be its winding-sheet."&#xD;
The tears stood in the old hero's eyes as he looked at&#xD;
the Empress; who, passing the bill, which promised to pay to&#xD;
the bearer, "with the seal of the Confederate States, one hun-&#xD;
dred dollars on demand at Richmond," turned to the General&#xD;
and Lieutenant Maury,- who stood by his side, and said, in a&#xD;
voice full of sympathy and feeling:&#xD;
"We look upon these relics as upon mementos of departed&#xD;
friends, with loving, saddened tenderness; yet with unmurmur-&#xD;
ing resignation to a fiat, that it is beyond our power to contro-&#xD;
vert."&#xD;
"And' yet," replied     Lieutenant Maury, "we may hang&#xD;
around these memories immortelles, that to us are ever fragrant.&#xD;
Even this poor Confederate bill, naught now, save an empty&#xD;
reminder of what has been, is invested by the poet's fancy with&#xD;
an eloquence that touches the heart. Your Majesty has never&#xD;
heard the beautiful verses that were found inscribed upon the&#xD;
back of one of these bills, after the fall of our Government?&#xD;
"'Representing nothing on God's earth now,&#xD;
And naught in the water below it,&#xD;
As a pledge of the nation that's dead and gone,&#xD;

To the tale this paper can tell,&#xD;
Of liberty born, of the patriot's dream,&#xD;
Of the storm-cradled nation that fell.&#xD;
Toopoor to possess the precious ore,&#xD;
And too much of a stranger to borrow,&#xD;
We issued to-day a promise to pay,&#xD;
And hoped to redeem on the morrow.&#xD;

But our coffers were empty still;&#xD;

But the faith that was in u was strong ind ed,&#xD;
"  !              And our poverty well discerned;&#xD;
And these little checks represented the pay,&#xD;
That our suffering volunteers earned.&#xD;
We knew it had hardly &amp;amp;value in gold,&#xD;
Yet as gold our soldiers received it ;&#xD;
It gazed on our eyes with a promise to pay,&#xD;
And each patriot soldier believed it.&#xD;
But our boys thought little of price or pay,&#xD;
Or bills that were overdue ;&#xD;
We knew if it bought us bread to-day,&#xD;
'Twas all our poor country could do.&#xD;
Keep it; it tells our history o'er,&#xD;
From the birth of its dream to the last;&#xD;
Modest, and born of the angel Hope,&#xD;
Like the hope of success, it passed.'&#xD;
Truly, ' vanished hopes    ' said the speaker, sadly, as he&#xD;
finished the recital.&#xD;
The Empress had listened with .deep interest to the touch-&#xD;
Ong requiem; and the feeling silence that followed was broken&#xD;
only by the adieux of those who were tak'g leave. As if&#xD;
moved by sudden impulse, as Carlotta extended her hand to&#xD;
ieutenant Maury, she exclaimed:&#xD;
"If Mexico can give homes to such a people, bid them&#xD;
come to us !   And, gentlemen, again let us say, do not hesitate&#xD;
to .apply to us, for any assistance it may be in our power to&#xD;
render you !"&#xD;
" And, in leaving," replied Lieutenant Maury, "we must crave&#xD;
your Majesties' pardon for dwelling so much upon our past; our&#xD;
hope lies now in the future ! "&#xD;
After. this interview with the Emperor and Empress, the&#xD;
colonists lost no time in making preparations and plans for a&#xD;
home for the loved ones who had been left behind, and who&#xD;
Were waiting to come to them.&#xD;
The decree of September 5, 1865, for the encouragement and&#xD;
establishment of American colonization in Mexico was drafted&#xD;
nd published, with the cordial approval and hearty endorsement&#xD;
pf the Emperor; and soon after, his Majesty appointed Lieu-&#xD;
tenant Maury chief commissioner of colonization, placing him&#xD;
kt the head of the bureau of colonization at the capital. General&#xD;
Price, Governor Harris, and Judge Perkins were also appointed&#xD;
commissioners, with instructions to examine the colonial lands&#xD;
in the different States, and report upon the soil, climate, and&#xD;
production; the object being to find 1that best suited to Ameri-&#xD;
pau residents.                       '.                      .&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
Assisted by General Joseph Shelby, of Missouri, and followed&#xD;
by most of the soldiers who had come with them, the coinmis-&#xD;
sioners visited the different departments ; and, after a careful&#xD;
consideration of all points bearing on the success of their colony,&#xD;
decided to settle in the Department of Vera Cruz, near the city&#xD;
of Cordova.&#xD;
It was now necessary that the lands in that district, granted&#xD;
to them by the Emperor, should be surveyed, and the plan of&#xD;
their city laid out. This task fell to General Magruder ; and&#xD;
being quickly accomplished, the emigrants went to work in&#xD;
earnest.&#xD;
The site for their city,. which, in compliment to the Empress,&#xD;
was to be called "Carlotta," was a beautiful eminence on the&#xD;
banks of the little river Seco, only a few miles from Cordova,&#xD;
and overlooked, in the distance, by the snow-capped heights&#xD;
of Orizaba.&#xD;
A forest of mango, mahogany, orange, and lemon trees was&#xD;
to be cleared away; but the brave hearts that rested beneath a&#xD;
simple sheet of canvas, upon that wintry December night,&#xD;
when first the colonists slept within the confines marked&#xD;
out for their future city, were not daunted at the prospect be-&#xD;
fore them. They rose up with the morning sun, day after day,&#xD;
and went to their labor, nerved 'with doubled strength, when&#xD;
they remembered that this was to be the home they had prom-&#xD;
ised to those left behind. Time and labor accomplishes all&#xD;
things.. As the weeks went by, the forest disappeared, and rude&#xD;
huts lifted their heads here and there ; and soon these, too, gave&#xD;
place to dwellings offering more comfort, and the plain was&#xD;
dotted with houses; for the families of the colonists had come&#xD;
out, and others, English and American emigrants, had joined&#xD;
them, until in the circumference of five miles or more were&#xD;
thirty or forty households; the little village, which had now&#xD;
begun to assume the dignity of municipal authorities, being the&#xD;
nucleus, the haciendas or farms, giving promise of a rich harvest&#xD;
from the coffee-trees and orange-groves upon which the owners&#xD;
expended their care.&#xD;
The hooded face of the distant mountain looked down with&#xD;
loving, patronizing care upon the little colony-looked, perhaps,&#xD;
with tender regret; for, with its head soaring amid the clouds,&#xD;
it doubtless saw beyond the present, and knew that all this&#xD;
would be naught-; that the time would come when "GCarlotta"&#xD;
would be a "deserted village," and not a human voice should&#xD;
be heard in those homes now filled with joy and laughte !&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
&#xD;
 IE summer had passed, and the Empress set out for a,&#xD;
. tour, during the autumn months, through jhe southern&#xD;
provinces. Matters of state importance prevented the&#xD;
Emperor's accompanying her Majesty, and so she was&#xD;
attended by her maid of honor, Senorita Gonzales ; Senor&#xD;
Ramirez, Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Belgian and Spanish&#xD;
Mniisters, and an escort of army officers.&#xD;
The excursion, at that delightful Indian-summer season, when&#xD;
n ture wore her. Joseph's robe - and received, ,as t e party was&#xD;
e erywhere, in the cities and villages of the different States with&#xD;
the wildest enthusiasm - was filled with pleasure. There was&#xD;
no place visited, but the Empress, like an angel of mercy, left&#xD;
sone token of love and beneficence behind. Hospitals, schools,&#xD;
all public charitable institutions, had tangible proof of her Maj-&#xD;
esty's goodness, in the deep interest she manifested in their&#xD;
success, and the large sums donated from her own income for&#xD;
their sustenance. Everywhere, Carlotta won the idolatrous love&#xD;
of the people ; and as she passed on her journey through the&#xD;
country, it was told with delight by the poor Indians, who had&#xD;
been so long strangers to kindness and courtesy fr m Mexican&#xD;
rulers, that she did not disdain, when occasion presented, to&#xD;
stop at their humble dwellings and accept their simple hospi-&#xD;
ta ity; and in their hearts, they named her the "W ite Dove "&#xD;
of Peace and }Happiness.-&#xD;
It was late in December, almost the Christmas time, when&#xD;
tht Empress reached the capital on her return, an communi-&#xD;
cated the gratifying and satisfactory account of the prosperity'&#xD;
and good, condition of the States she had visited.&#xD;
The Emperor had been at thi National Palace during the&#xD;
E  press's absence; and when she returned, they decided to re-&#xD;
main with the court in the city, for some weeks, before returning&#xD;
to Chepultepec..&#xD;
There was an additional cause to give -festivity t, the holi-&#xD;
days; Inez had consented that her marriage with Giuian should&#xD;
tage place on the second day of the new year; and there was to&#xD;
be a grand reception at the palace, though the cerem ny was to&#xD;
be performed at the cathedral. The Emperor and. Empress&#xD;
took the deepest interest in the, event, which was to crown the'&#xD;
&#xD;
happiness of the two. But Sorrow always follows in the foot.&#xD;
steps of joy; and in the midst of their planning, lifted her hand&#xD;
to dash all their pleasure. Her stroke fell now upon the Em-&#xD;
press, whose heart received a heavy blow in the crushing intel-&#xD;
ligence that she was left an orphan. King Leopold, the wise,&#xD;
just ruler of Belgium, breathed his last on the 9th of December,&#xD;
and had been laid away to rest, full,%of years and crowned with&#xD;
honors.&#xD;
Early in life, Carlotta had been deprived pf the loving care&#xD;
of a mother, and from that period, her little girlhood, to her&#xD;
marriage, it had been a careful father's hand that had watched&#xD;
and guided her footsteps. He was the one who had developed&#xD;
all her powers, cultivated her judgment and reasoning abilities.&#xD;
He had taught her much of human nature, and had made her&#xD;
a true, sound-thinking woman; the generous, careful Em-&#xD;
press; the devoted, self-sacrificing wife she was: for the princi-&#xD;
ples inculcated in youth, the good seed sown then, had not been&#xD;
forgotten or choked out by the world, but in Mexico were bear-&#xD;
ing fruit, were giving food to thousands of starving minds and&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
But King Leopold had paid the last debt; he was gone, with&#xD;
all his goodness and wisdom, and the people of the earth would&#xD;
see him no more !&#xD;
The Mexican Court went into mourning; there was a gloom&#xD;
cast over the whole palace. The Emperor and Empress wo1et&#xD;
sad, grief-stricken countenances, for it was a heavy loss to them&#xD;
both.&#xD;
The marriage, of course, was postponed for a month, when it&#xD;
would still occur at the Cathedral; only the reception at tho&#xD;
palace would not be held.&#xD;
As the Emperor passed as much time as he could command&#xD;
from his duties, with the Empress in these days of affliction,&#xD;
Inez found herself able to be at her uncle's, with Afita and&#xD;
Giulian, much oftener than before.&#xD;
Anita had grown so quiet and sad that Inez reproached her-&#xD;
self for leaving her ; and determined, after her marriage with&#xD;
Giulian, to give up her position near the Empress, and return&#xD;
to her old way of living.&#xD;
It lacked but a few days of the new year. Christmas had&#xD;
passed; and the day after, the Emperor, desiring to send im-&#xD;
portant dispatches to the commander at Puebla by some trusty&#xD;
officer, selected Giulian for the mission; and, provided with a&#xD;
safe escort, he prepared to leave at dawn on the following day.&#xD;

twas the evening before his dep rture, and h stood with&#xD;
Inez in the corridor, overlooking the court-yard at her uncle's&#xD;
home.&#xD;
The evening shades were gathering about them, and Giulian&#xD;
lingered at his parting. The mists were rising fro  the foun-&#xD;
fain below; and around, the dusky haze of twilight was throw-&#xD;
ing the stone walls and the short pillars of the corridor into&#xD;
hadow.&#xD;
"Inez," said Giulian, taking her hand in his, "why do I&#xD;
Enger so to-night ? You have grown so dear to me of late, that&#xD;
even to say 'adieu' for a day costs a sigh ! Yo  remember,&#xD;
Inez, those noble words of Andromache, at her arting with&#xD;
Hector-' Thou, Hector, art to me - father, moth r, brother -&#xD;
allt!' They come up to me, my own, always wiih your face.&#xD;
'Let me be worthy of her !' is my prayer, night and day. Do&#xD;
you know I have told Isolani, long ago, that it w s too much&#xD;
happiness for me, that you should be mine ; an even now I&#xD;
tremble lest something should take you from md. But could&#xD;

content to walk with me here? aye, and up there , too?" said&#xD;
he, pointing upward. "Mine here, and in the world to come,&#xD;
too? "&#xD;
Oh! if he only knew the bitterness 'that his prds brought&#xD;
to her heart, the pain that the fulness of his love gave her !&#xD;
She would be his here, but up there, -in heaven, ould not the&#xD;
true marriage come ?  Giulian was waiting for her answer.&#xD;
Why could she not prize this jewel that he offe-ed her?  It&#xD;
was a jewel, a crystal, of untold value ; for it was he first, true,&#xD;
abiding love of a noble man.&#xD;
" Inez ! " said Giulian, softly, "I am waiting  Spy to me&#xD;
only once, 'Giulian, I am happy!'&#xD;
Could she not say it ? Was it not happiness e ough for her&#xD;
that she had made him so?&#xD;
"'Giulian," she said, smiling half sadly, "wher is the crown-&#xD;
ing jewel of -trust,--hidden in your nature ? 'Perfect -love&#xD;
casteth out fear.' We shall be happy together ; is not that&#xD;
enough ?"&#xD;
" True love is like the grave that cries 'give, give !'" pleaded&#xD;
the lover. " But I will not weary you with this (restless heart.&#xD;
Let. me whisper once .more ' you are my all,? and then -&#xD;
Adieu ! "&#xD;
He pressed her to his heart, a long kiss upon her brow&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
and then, turning to go down the little steps into the court-&#xD;
yard, stopped a'moment longer, to whisper,;-&#xD;
"I shall be with you on the New Year's morn; until then,&#xD;
your prayers for me !&#xD;
It was the closing evening of the year. At the palace there&#xD;
was a little circle gathered in the Empress's parlor ; and as the&#xD;
wind whistled round the corner without, and then swept over&#xD;
the Plaza, they drew nearer together, and seemed to catch a feel-&#xD;
ing of comfort, and a spirit of thankfulness from their luxurious&#xD;
surroundings.&#xD;
The Emperor and Empress sat a little apart, conversing with&#xD;
the Austrian and Belgian Ministers ; while the Countess Zichy&#xD;
had gathered the other members of the household about her ;&#xD;
and she and Madame Del Barrio, a lady of honor, recently ap-&#xD;
pointed, were entertaining them with old German legends, and&#xD;
Mexican superstitions.&#xD;
Inez sat on a little sofa near the Countess, listening, half to&#xD;
the marvellous stories, and half heeding the whispered com-&#xD;
ments of Count Ducroix, a lively young French officer who&#xD;
sat by her side. But, though she seemed to give attention to&#xD;
those around her, her thoughts would wander away from the&#xD;
little parlor, with every echo of the wind without, and make&#xD;
their way over the lonely plains that stretched out between the&#xD;
capital and Puebla; for she knew that, true to his promise,&#xD;
Giulian was hastening through this night-wind wild, to be in,&#xD;
to greet her with a "happy New Year ! "&#xD;
As she thought of the Black Forest through which she knew&#xD;
his way brought him, dark, dismal, and dreary, haunted by the&#xD;
phantom spectres of the murdered travellers that fell in scores&#xD;
with every moon, victims to the rapacity of the banditti who made&#xD;
their homes in the gloomy caverns of the mountain side, and&#xD;
nightly came down on the unprotected, like.the "wolf on the.&#xD;
fold," a strange, apprehensive, nervous feeling for Giulian's&#xD;
safety, took possession of her mind. With that gift of presci-&#xD;
ence,--mysterious, yet rarely failing to be the peculiar guide of&#xD;
woman, --she seemed to feel that there was a "shadow of coming&#xD;
evil " creeping tower rds her, and whispering the name of her be-&#xD;
trothed, as the one chosen for distress or death. It could not&#xD;
be, that he was not to pass the forest in safety ; for his escort&#xD;
was strong and true, and there was nothing to fear with them&#xD;
near him. And yet, her excited fancy, worked upon by baseless&#xD;
fears, brought before her the terrible picture of Giulian lying&#xD;

dead and alone, and the features of the murderer that bent over&#xD;
him were strangely like those of Juan Gonzales.&#xD;
Juan, Inez knew, had been near the City of Mexico months&#xD;
ago; but, as she had heard nothing of him since that strange&#xD;
meeting in the early spring-time, she hoped that he had at last&#xD;
left them in peace; and yet to-night, the reme brance of his&#xD;
vindictive words, that he shaped into a solemn  vow, at their&#xD;
parting long ago, at Querataro, that he would ut " the sword&#xD;
between Giulian Navarro, and herself," came to her as'a fearful&#xD;
reality. If he had heard of their approaching marriage, he&#xD;
would try to perform that vow ; and Inez thought he was such&#xD;
a faithful servant of the Prince of Darkness, hat she almost&#xD;
believed he was invested with supernatural power to execute&#xD;
his fiendish plans.&#xD;
" Senorita Inez, you are not listening -you are not listen-&#xD;
ing," whispered Count Ducroix.. "We shall have to fine you&#xD;
for contempt' of these august personages !"&#xD;
Just at this moment, the Countess Zichy declared that, "she&#xD;
had indulged in this child's play quite long enough, and her&#xD;
budget of legends was exhausted."&#xD;
"4No, no ! 'one more ! " cried Count Ducroix. " We are ex-&#xD;
cusable on New Year's Eve. Give us something to finish on,&#xD;
- perfectly frightful, -after the fashion of 'The Spectre Bride-&#xD;
groom !'&#xD;
" Ah!" siid the Emperor, who had come towards them just,&#xD;
in time to catch the Count's words, "something that shall make&#xD;
each particular hair stand on end ! Countess, Madame del&#xD;
Barrio and yourself are entitled to a new rank. We .shall have&#xD;
to decorate you with the 'Order of Scheherazade -the Queen&#xD;
of Story-tell rs,' and commend you to all unfortunates who suffer&#xD;
from ennui /"&#xD;
The ladies received their new honor most graciously; but, in&#xD;
spite of the ,nited entreaties of the Empress, and the two Minis-&#xD;
ters, who h d now come up, they could not risk losing their&#xD;
reputation by finishing with a poor story ; and the best had&#xD;
already been told.&#xD;
" Then," aid the Emperor, "since you both are implacable,"&#xD;
we throw ourselves upon Senorita Gonzales' tender mercies.&#xD;
Count Zich , let us have the harp, and Senorita Inez will give&#xD;
us a New Y'ar's chant ! Ah ! if we only had Count Isolani and&#xD;
Captain Na arro here to-night, this would be pleasure!&#xD;
The Emp ror had touched a chord in Inez'is heart, that vi--&#xD;
brated and t grilled with exquisite pain. They were both away;&#xD;

the one she might never see again; and yet there was a feeling&#xD;
that if she could see him once again, before there was a barrier&#xD;
between them, that it would be easier for her to walk in the toil&#xD;
some path of duty. And then, there was this strange, fearfully&#xD;
impressive feeling, that there was some danger threatening Giu-&#xD;
lian, that she tried in vain to shake off.&#xD;
Almost in a dream, she accepted Count Ducroix's arm, and&#xD;
went to the seat before the beautiful gilt harp. She touched&#xD;
the strings; and the deep, full chords came forth in exquisite&#xD;
harmony. Always, when sad and weary, it had been her cus-&#xD;
torn to go to her harp, to pour forth her sorrow through its&#xD;
voice, or listen to the' comfort that lay in the sound of its&#xD;
sweet tones; and to-night, that inanimate friend was faithful to&#xD;
her, and with the first notes sent down into her heart, a soft&#xD;
echo of sympathetic sadness.&#xD;
Forgetting almost that others were listening, and following&#xD;
the impulse of her own heart, she began an old melody that&#xD;
she had learned long ago -a soft, good-night song:&#xD;
"Day is past;&#xD;
Stars have set their watch at last.&#xD;
Founts that through the deep woods flow&#xD;
Wake Sweet sounds unheard till now.&#xD;
Flowers have shut with fading light,-&#xD;
Good-nightI"&#xD;
The tones of inexpressible sweetness floated through the apart-&#xD;
ment, now swelling into rich fulness, now coming so softly that&#xD;
they seemed to hover and tremble with harmony, and at last&#xD;
dying away in the echo, " Good-night! "&#xD;
The listeners were enraptured.   'One more,- one more,"&#xD;
whispered Count Ducroix, who stood beside her.&#xD;
" Inez," said the Empress, "give us that beautiful, touching&#xD;
requiem for a dead warrior, that you sing so often for me. I&#xD;
want Count de Thun to hear it."&#xD;
Inez began the air that the Empress loved so well. They&#xD;
were words that she had set to music herself:&#xD;
"By a mountain stream at rest,&#xD;
We, found the warrior lying,&#xD;
And around his noble breast&#xD;
A banner clasped in dying;&#xD;
Dark and still&#xD;
Antewindonghet were sighing."&#xD;
The tears were welling up from her heart, and as she sanig&#xD;
the last verse her voice was tremulous with emotion:&#xD;

"Yet from festive hi11 and lay,&#xD;
Our sad thoughts oft are flying,&#xD;
To those dark hills far away,&#xD;
Where in death we found him lying.&#xD;
On his breast&#xD;
A banner press'd,&#xD;
And the night-wind o'er him sighing."&#xD;
&#xD;
The words seemed to freeze upon her lips ; her heart grew&#xD;
chill within, or there before her, she seemed to see the picture.&#xD;
there was the young soldier, the same terrible  ncy that clung&#xD;
t her still; and it was Giulian, lying alone o4the mountain&#xD;
side. The conversation had begun around her, when the musio&#xD;
chased, so that her emotion had not been not d. She called&#xD;
softly to Count Ducroix,=--&#xD;
"' Ask her Majesty's permission that I may retire. I am not'&#xD;
well this evening."&#xD;
Anxious at the pallor that the Count saw gn her face, and&#xD;
the change that had crept over her features, Count Ducroix was&#xD;
sbon at the Empress' side.&#xD;
"It is nothing serious, I trust ? " said she, anxiously, as the&#xD;
Count made his petition. "Certainly; Senorita Inez may retire;&#xD;
countess Zichy had, perhaps, better go with her; and I will&#xD;
see her myself soon.".&#xD;
" It's only a little heart-pining, I think, your Majesty," said&#xD;
t e Count, as he turned away.&#xD;
" Perhaps a glass of wine would make you better, Senorita ? "&#xD;
stid he, as he offered Inez his arm to conduct her into the hall.&#xD;
"No, no ! " said she, hastily. "I shall soon, be better, any&#xD;
ay. I am much obliged for your kindness, Count Ducroix.&#xD;
dood-night ! "&#xD;
Inez hastened up the stairs, and was soon alone in her own&#xD;
c amber.   Going to the window-seat, that was her favorite&#xD;
place she sat there looking out upon the night, listening -to&#xD;
the mournful wail of the blasts, that, sweeping by the old con-&#xD;
vents, seemed to bear on to the Plaza -all deserted and lonely&#xD;
as it was now, -"a sound of woe."&#xD;
She sat there, with her head resting on her hands, by the&#xD;
stone casement, gazing vacantly outward, and tried to shake off,&#xD;
o to define what this weight was, that oppressed her so. What&#xD;
had brought before her that fearful scene, that she shuddered&#xD;
tc recall ?  It was with her still; and she felt that to-morrow&#xD;
same mournful truth would come.&#xD;
And there were other thoughts, that forced themselves into&#xD;
h r presence to-night, in spite of the ban she had placed upon&#xD;
&#xD;
CR0 W7N JEWELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
them. Surely she was not afraid now, since the days were&#xD;
slipping away so fast and bringing the sacred vows so near,&#xD;
that she would not be able to be true to Giulian;" that she&#xD;
would not be able. to give unto him a meet return, for the&#xD;
wealth of truth and love that he offered.?&#xD;
She knew that the love- for Victor Isolani still lingered in&#xD;
her heart; but this night she would cast itout. The stroke bf&#xD;
the deep midnight bell fell upon her ear; and she remembered&#xD;
that it was the hour for mass for the dying year.&#xD;
Yes! if it had been a sin to love Victor Isolani, she would&#xD;
lay it, with, all the omissions and commissions, the shortcomings&#xD;
and overreachngs of the past year, at the foot of the cross,,and&#xD;
would pray that one drop of that blood, whiclr cleanseth from&#xD;
all sin, should fal upon the record that eighteen hundred and&#xD;
sixty-five held for her; and, God helping her, with the New&#xD;
Year she would begin a life of honesty and devotion as Giu-&#xD;
han's wife.&#xD;
The last stroke was dying away on the air, Inez rose, and&#xD;
leaving her room, descended a flight of stairs -that led to the&#xD;
chapel.&#xD;
Noiselessly she opened the oaken door and went in. A sol-&#xD;
itary wax taper burned upon the altars; the spangled stars in&#xD;
the blue satin ceiling above, glimmered faintly through the cloud&#xD;
of incense that came up from the pendent censer. Back from&#xD;
the altar, all was gloom and indistinctness.&#xD;
Crossing herself with holy water from the little marble fount&#xD;
near the doorway, Inez trod softly up the aisle, and knelt in&#xD;
front of the gilded railing around the chancel. Before her was&#xD;
the cross, and the suffering Christ. As she looked up, He&#xD;
seemed to cast upon her a tender, pitying glance, and lifting&#xD;
her hands towards Him, she murmured her prayer:&#xD;
- "0O! Lamb of God, that takest away the sins. of the world,&#xD;
have mercy upon me ! 0 Lamb of God, that taketh away the&#xD;
sins of the world, help us this night, we pray thee ! Oh, blessed&#xD;
Saviour ! thou who didst pray at Gethsemane, give thy child,&#xD;
this night faith and strength to overcome evil and to follow the&#xD;
right ! Extend thy care, I0 Lord, to those who travel by land&#xD;
or sea. Deliver them from all danger. - Be with them, and -&#xD;
keep them now, and in the hour of death."&#xD;
She bent her head upon the railing, and continued silently,&#xD;
her prayer.&#xD;
From the organ behind, there came* a still, solemn strain.&#xD;
The notes, at first low and subdued, rolled forth, and a deep&#xD;
&#xD;

voice solemnly chanting accompanied them. Inez listened, and&#xD;
her heart joined Father Fischer in his last mass.&#xD;
The music ceased. The Father closed the organ, and descend-&#xD;
ing from the little gallery went out. Inez too- arose, and left&#xD;
the chapel; for she knew that he would return in a few mo-&#xD;
ments in his robes to-perform his devotions.&#xD;
As she went up the staircase, she found the Empress at the&#xD;
head, waiting.&#xD;
"You are more devotional-than any of us, Inez," she said,&#xD;
taking her hand. "I went up to see you before we retired ;&#xD;
but finding your chamber deserted, fancied you had gone to the&#xD;
chapel. Come!" she continued, as they entered- her Majesty's&#xD;
apartment, " tell me, Inez, what it is that has troubled you so&#xD;
this evening. Is it Giulian's absence that has banished the&#xD;
glad smile from your face ?  I was afraid you might be quite&#xD;
indisposed from  Count Ducroix's anxious manner when he&#xD;
asked to have you excused."&#xD;
The Empress had drawn her to a seat beside her, on the sofa,&#xD;
and her tender, sisterly love touched Inez' heart.&#xD;
" I do not know, your Majesty, that I could give a real rea-&#xD;
son for my unusual feeling to-night. I have been the prey to&#xD;
a nervous feeling of undefined apprehension, which forces upon&#xD;
me a dread of coming trouble."&#xD;
"And this apprehension, quite naturally, hangs itself about&#xD;
Giulian," said the Empress, smiling. " Ah ! child, your heart&#xD;
must learn more fortitude. A soldier's wife has need of all&#xD;
that she can command. Have faith, my darling, in the protec-&#xD;
tion of a good God. You say he has promised to be here to&#xD;
wish you a happy New Year, and even if he should not come&#xD;
to-morrow, -"think,-it is a long, weary ride to Puebla,; and the&#xD;
Emperor gave him leave of absence for three days longer."&#xD;
The Empress' loving sympathy opened inez' heart ; and she&#xD;
told her of the- fancy that had filled her mind, and pictured&#xD;
the worst reality before the eyes of her brain, during the even-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
" Ah! Inez, your love for Giulian leads you away. It is&#xD;
rest you need. Giulian will be here all safely. Dismiss these&#xD;
fears ; sleep quietly to-night, and let us go together at the&#xD;
dawn to the mass at the Cathedral. - Let us begin the year&#xD;
aright. You will be happier to-morrow. Bon nuit?/ "&#xD;
The Empress kissed the tears away, and Inez sought her own&#xD;
apartment ; where at last she fell into a troubled~, restless sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
&#xD;
IS mission accomplished, and the despatches delivered&#xD;
safely to the Commanding General at Puebla, Captain&#xD;
Navarro could not content himself to remain there&#xD;
longer. The leave of absence granted them, gave himself and&#xD;
escort three days more; but though he had promised Inez he&#xD;
would be with her on New Year's day, he found that his escort&#xD;
had gotten into the gayeties of the holidays, and were loth to&#xD;
quit Puebla. So,: in his generous spirit, that always consulted&#xD;
the happiness of others first, he determined to leave his men&#xD;
behind to indulge themselves as long as possible, and he would&#xD;
return to Mexico alone. It would be a dangerous experiment,&#xD;
for the road in some parts lay through a region given up to&#xD;
robbers who defied the military to turn them out of their rocky&#xD;
fastnesses; but love and hope gave triple courage, and he set.&#xD;
forth on horseback alone, just before a gloomy sunrising, on&#xD;
the morning of the thirty-first -of December. The diligence&#xD;
would follow an hour later, and he would, doubtless, be over-&#xD;
taken by it and command the benefit of the'guard which always&#xD;
accompanied it. But that was neither here nor there; he&#xD;
must see Inez on the morrow, and he had never broken eves,&#xD;
the lightest promise made to her.&#xD;
As the spires and steeples of the city were left behind, and&#xD;
the young officer entered the plain that spreads out around it,&#xD;
the morning air, pure and bracing, though a little chilly, came&#xD;
refreshingly into his face. Loosing the reins, he let them fall&#xD;
carelessly in front of him; and gave his trusty steed, that&#xD;
stepped on so firmly and proudly, his own pace.&#xD;
The country through which he now passed was flat and un-&#xD;
interesting, and many leagues stretched out between it, and the&#xD;
beautiful' valley. Though now they took their own time, yet&#xD;
Giulian knew that he could spur up his gallant black in the&#xD;
evening hours, and he would reach the capital before the mid-&#xD;
night bell had given its farewell stroke. So he gave himself&#xD;
up to reverie and pleasant thought.&#xD;
" Another year had come and gone to mingle  with the mys-&#xD;
terious tide of Old Eternity!"  What did it bear away for&#xD;
him?' What record was summed up by the angel above to his&#xD;

account ? Were there any strokes too deep and black to be&#xD;
washed out by Mercy's tear ? He had tried to serve his coun-&#xD;
try and his God ; and if there had been a time when he had&#xD;
been lacking in the fulfilment of his duty to his fellow-man he&#xD;
knew it not. Giulian had no complaint of neglect or ill-usage&#xD;
to enter against the departing spirit that was sighing "fare-&#xD;
well " this day, to the hills and valleys far and near ; for it&#xD;
had "given him a friend and a true, true love ; " and his heart&#xD;
in fancy, chimed an echo to *the distant ringing, "sad and&#xD;
slow," of the church bells that would at the midnight hour toll&#xD;
the knell of a dead year.&#xD;
And there was the New Year, coy and timid, standing upon&#xD;
the threshold, waiting for a greeting, and a smile of welcome !&#xD;
For Giulian, it had caught the same sweet song that had fallen&#xD;
on his ear these months past ; the tiny voice of the new-comer&#xD;
was chanting too of life, and hope, and love ! Let the little&#xD;
lone come in quickly, with its message for each. His, he knew,&#xD;
was filled with joy and happiness, and a fulfilment of the prom-&#xD;
ise made long ago !&#xD;
With such pleasant thoughts as companions, driving away&#xD;
all feeling of loneliness, he rode onward, hardly marking the&#xD;
changes of scenery on the way, or noting that the -sun, though&#xD;
shining through clouds, had well-nigh reached the zenith.&#xD;
He reached a little inn, however, that stood between morning.&#xD;
and afternoon to the traveller; and stopping there, he waited&#xD;
with the keeper, a loquacious old Mexican, who tried to while&#xD;
away the time with the same dribbling of questions and que-&#xD;
ries with which he had wearied the patience- of as many guests&#xD;
as there were days in;the year. Giulia.n waited with the hope&#xD;
of seeing the diligence from Puebla. come up ; but as an hour&#xD;
slipped away, and the old Mexican stood in the doorway and;&#xD;
observed, in his broken Spanish dialect,&#xD;
" She's late to-day ! Behind time  something wrong, I'm&#xD;
raid!&#xD;
Giulian's patience, which had been rapidly diminishing, quite&#xD;
ave out, and he -ordered his horse at once.&#xD;
" Better wait, Cap'n, better wait," said the old host. "'Twas&#xD;
pnly two weeks ago there was a conduct killed in that Black&#xD;
Forest ! There was a regular fight between the guard and the&#xD;
robbers ; but 'twasn't no use ! Wish Juarez had all his men&#xD;
vith him ; for a man's life is not worth asking for on the road&#xD;
Between here and Mexico. The Emperor ought to see to it !"&#xD;
Notwithstanding this terrible picture and pointed example,&#xD;
&#xD;
CROW   JEWLS.            -    .26T&#xD;
Giulian set out again alone; as he had ample confidence in a&#xD;
protecting Providence, and the strength of his own right arm,&#xD;
to defend him from these unknown enemies.&#xD;
Late in the afternoon he found himself but a few miles from&#xD;
the dreaded forest, the solitude of whose lonely pines were&#xD;
haunted by dangerous mysteries. The sun was just setting as&#xD;
he reached the brow of a hill upon its confines, and for a mo-&#xD;
ment he drew up his rein. The last sun of eighteen hundred&#xD;
and sixty-five ! Though its glories were obscured now and then&#xD;
by vapory clouds that floated across its disk, and shut out its&#xD;
brightness, yet it was sinking behind the hills not entirely&#xD;
shorn of its beams; for there was a radiant glow on the purple&#xD;
sky, and the lowering clouds were fringed with brightness..&#xD;
Giulian stopped but long enough to draw from his bosom an&#xD;
oval pearl case, and touching its spring, the beautiful face of his&#xD;
betrothed was before him. He must take one glance of that in-&#xD;
spiring countenance, before the darkness came on without.&#xD;
Raising it to his lips, he murmured,&#xD;
'' She will be mine at last! Only one more short month ! "&#xD;
He put the talisman back again at its old place, nearest his&#xD;
heart; where, if possible, it might feel the warm, soft beating&#xD;
that had pulsated for it alone, through the many years that had&#xD;
brought him from boyhood to manhood.    In a moment, his&#xD;
mind ran back to the time when the youth and the little maiden&#xD;
had strayed together over the hills at Querataro; and to the&#xD;
evenings, when, side by side, they wondered over the same story-&#xD;
book of fairies and fairy-land, with no one save Juan to come&#xD;
between them; and he thanked God, though he had often&#xD;
dashed their youthful sport and childish pleasure, he could not&#xD;
thwart them now - could not take her from him now.&#xD;
The thought of Juan seemed to waken him; to make him&#xD;
feel that he must get nearer to her; and giving the word of&#xD;
command to his impatient steed, he began to descend the hill,&#xD;
towards the forest that lay just ahead.&#xD;
Giulian rode on in silence and solitude. Now the way led&#xD;
along the ledge, of a mountainous precipice, with huge rocks&#xD;
towering above ; and again, downwards into the gloom of silent,&#xD;
mournful pines. Occasionally he passed a rude cross, planted on&#xD;
the roadside to mark the grave .of some murdered postillion or&#xD;
conductor, or set up by some Samaritan hand to cheer the de-&#xD;
spairing traveller through these Plutonian regions, by reminding&#xD;
him that there is One above who is a constant watcher, and&#xD;
cares for all.&#xD;

It wasgowing colder with the night; the air was heavy&#xD;
nd damp with mist, and rough blasts sweeping down the&#xD;
ountain slopes, struck a chilliness through the young man's&#xD;
frame that made him draw his sarape mare- closely, and&#xD;
heer on his steed. It was a'dismal, dreary ride ; and Giulian&#xD;
ad just reached the darkest portion of his route, when he&#xD;
eard behind him the clatter of horse's hoofs Involuntarily,.&#xD;
is hand was upon his sword, and in an inst nt the belt that&#xD;
held his holsters and dagger was slipped to th side, so that he&#xD;
ould seize them in a moment.&#xD;
" A dark night, senor," said the voice near him, "and a&#xD;
lonely ride; you do not object to company, I trust ?  The dili-&#xD;
gence met- with an accident which delays it  or some hours;&#xD;
4nd as I was anxious to get on, the innkeeper furnished me a&#xD;
orse, and told me I should find company through the forest."&#xD;
The voide was strange, and yet there seemed something&#xD;
amiliar to Giulian in it. As he assented to the man's pro-&#xD;
osal, he cast a searching glance .towards hin; but in the un-&#xD;
ertain light shed by the few timid stars, whose rays ventured&#xD;
remblingly through the darkness, he could only distinguish the&#xD;
gure of a horseman, with a sombrero hiding the upper portion&#xD;
f his face, and a heavy black beard covering the remainder ;&#xD;
while the huge Mexican sarape hanging over his shoulder,&#xD;
eached to the high riding-boots, with immense brass spurs.&#xD;
he stranger's tout ensemble was just the san e as. one meets&#xD;
hundred times a day in Mexico, during the wet season.&#xD;
" Do you think we will get in to-night? " was the next&#xD;
uery; for Giulian was rather taciturn.&#xD;
" I think it doubtful," said the officer ; "the clouds are&#xD;
g thering so rapidly, that perhaps we shall be compelled to stop&#xD;
a the in on the other side of the forest."&#xD;
Just then a blast of wind came sweeping through the tall&#xD;
es that waved their heads solemnly to and fro, and in their&#xD;
moving seemed to echo the voice of the com ng storm. The&#xD;
t o travellers rode on together, each keeping pace with the&#xD;
o er, and neither seeming inclined to grow more familiar ; and&#xD;
the silence was only broken by occasional exclamations at the&#xD;
ini easing darkness.S&#xD;
" By heaven! this beats Erebus," cried the stranger, drawing&#xD;
his sarape up. "If it keeps on at this rate, we hall plunge into&#xD;
the lower regions before we know it ! What's that we see&#xD;
yonder ?~ "      .&#xD;
On a little knoll in the distance, there gleamed a white cross&#xD;
&#xD;
'68&#xD;
&#xD;
ROW! JEWEL&#xD;
&#xD;
-- the only distinct object-in all the shadowy gloom. As ,they&#xD;
pressed nearer to it, the trees grew less closely, and it began to&#xD;
grow~ lighter. The stranger, as if leaning forward to discern&#xD;
the heavenly token more clearly, bent a keen, piercing glance&#xD;
into Captain Navarro's face; and turning quickly, he drew up&#xD;
his .rein so tightly and suddenlythat he threw his horse back&#xD;
upon his haunches, and the animal's eyes gleamed out from&#xD;
their sockets with an unnatural fire.&#xD;
The movement startled Captain Navarro, but in an instant&#xD;
he had wheeled his horse about, and for the first time was&#xD;
face to face with his companion. Each looked steadily into&#xD;
the eyes of the other, and there was a flash of hate in those of&#xD;
the stranger, as he threw up his sombrero and exclaimed,-&#xD;
" We are met at last, Giulian Navarro ! Did you think I&#xD;
would forget you and Inez; though you both seem to have done&#xD;
me that favor?"&#xD;
" We are honored, Senor Gonzales," said Giulian, with cut-&#xD;
ting sarcasm in his voice, "by your remembrance -"&#xD;
" This most opportune meeting," said Gonzales, interrupt-&#xD;
ing him, " obviates the. necessity of a dangerous adventure ;&#xD;
for it is dangerous for a free Mexican to venture to:his cap-&#xD;
ital in these days of Imperial liberty  Though I have been in&#xD;
the City of Mexico for more than six months past, and have had&#xD;
it in my power to put this Imperial usurper and some of his&#xD;
good followers out of the way a score of times ; yet I have for-&#xD;
borne, as I' think things are getting in proper train to work&#xD;
themselves out. It is not an idle boast when- Isay that some&#xD;
of his Majesty's favorites, that would lick the dust upon which&#xD;
he treads, out of his presence, hold the hand to aid his enemy.&#xD;
But that is not the point now ; " he continued ; " my -busiess&#xD;
to-night is with you, Giulian Navarro, and can be settled here&#xD;
as well as elsewhere."&#xD;
".I am at Senor Gonzales' command," replied Giulian, with&#xD;
mock courtesy; "and if possible," he added, "his business shall&#xD;
be settled forever!"&#xD;
"Giulian Navarro ! " exclaimed Gonzales, stung by the cool&#xD;
and fearless manner that Giulian had assumed, "there is  o&#xD;
use to waste words between us. Inez Gonzales is a wom n,&#xD;
and has no right to disgrace the name she bears by wedding a&#xD;
traitor. The old, grudge is rankling here still," putting  s&#xD;
hand to his heart,," and the seal has been added to- it, since&#xD;
you have worn thie uniform of this mock Emperor !"&#xD;
.Giulaia's face brned at the insult.&#xD;

"Gonzales ! " he cried, pushing up the large hat that fell&#xD;
ver his brow, and grasping restlessly his half-drawn sword,&#xD;
'you dare not repeat those words !  Not even from you -not&#xD;
yen for Inez' sake, will this insult be taken ! There is but one&#xD;
ay for this, and you force it on me&#xD;
"You or Imust die Navarro ! " cried-onzales, finishing the&#xD;
entence.&#xD;
"sAnddie you shall !" cried Giulian, leaping from his horse,'&#xD;
hrowing the reins back over the saddle, and wrenching his&#xD;
sword from its scabbard.&#xD;
The movements of his antagonist had kept pace with his&#xD;
wn ; and they now stood face to face with drawn swords, each&#xD;
aiting for the other to make the first thrust.&#xD;
When two who should meet as brothers cross swords as deadly&#xD;
enemies, there is no mercy ; and such was the conflict that be-&#xD;
an in the depths of the Black Forest with no witnesses save&#xD;
he stars, that now and then looked half-frightened through the&#xD;
ifts of the gathering clouds.&#xD;
With a savage, grating sound, the swords clashed. Hate&#xD;
erved the arm of the one with more than human strength, and&#xD;
he other fought for life -life, that, with the near approach&#xD;
f happiness, was growing each day more prec ous.&#xD;
"AhI1 fondly youthful hearts can press&#xD;
To seize and share the dear caress;-&#xD;
But love itself could never pant,&#xD;
For all that beauty sighs to grant,&#xD;
With half the fervor hate bestows&#xD;
Upon the last embrace of foes;&#xD;
When grappling in the fight they fold&#xD;
Those arms that ne'er shall loose their hold.&#xD;
Friends meet to part ; love laughs at faith ;&#xD;
True foes once met are joined till death."&#xD;
Captain Navarro parried the thrusts of his antagonist with&#xD;
asterly skill. In youth they had learned together the art of&#xD;
encing from, the same master, and each knew the hand of the&#xD;
other was to be dreaded.&#xD;
The conflict grew more fierce. Death was coming fast to&#xD;
ne. Suddenly throwing himself to the left, Gonzales directs&#xD;
bis sword for a telling blow. Quickly Giuliain turns to meet&#xD;
it. My God ! it is too late ! his sabre is dashed from his hand,&#xD;
nd he staggers backward -- backward -and. falls heavily to&#xD;
bhe earth. From his side a crimson current, his heart's blood,&#xD;
flows out, but there is not a groan, to tell that he is dying.&#xD;
For one moment, Juan Gonzales bent over him, and as their&#xD;
eyes met, the one so full of pain and the death agony, the other&#xD;
&#xD;
lit up with the satanic triumph of gratified revenge, only o e&#xD;
word escaped them both, - - "Inez!"&#xD;
"Inez ! " hissed the brother and murderer, as he held p&#xD;
a large seal ring that he had always worn, and slipped it on&#xD;
Giulian's unresisting finge   - -' this token shall tell her the&#xD;
truth: I did not forget her!   Adieu, Senor Navarro!"&#xD;
" Inez ! Inez ! "  echoed faintly the bleeding lover.         is&#xD;
despairing tones were lost; for Gonzales had -leapt lightly     to&#xD;
his saddle, and the sound of his horses' hoofs striking the ea th&#xD;
in quick succession told that, when the morning dawned, it&#xD;
would-find him many leagues from the scene of his dark niglt's&#xD;
work.&#xD;

"The hooded clouds, like friars,&#xD;

Aye ! the dead lover lieth there, still and cold, with the piti-&#xD;
less rain-drops, - nay, with the, tears shed by the weeping stars&#xD;
falling tenderly upon his whitened, upturned face ; his faithful&#xD;
horse, as if with knowledge of its loss, bending his noble h ad&#xD;
downward, until his jetty mane swept the face of the loved&#xD;
master-the only watcher, yet true and devoed, beside the un-&#xD;
heeding dead.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
HOUGH the night had been misty and dark, the clouds&#xD;
cleared away before the morning, and the sun of the&#xD;
New Year rose bright and strong, dispelling the hazi-&#xD;
ness that had ushered in the dawn.&#xD;
With the earliest rays of light, the Empressand Inez left the&#xD;
palace for the Cathedral. It took, after descending the steps&#xD;
and finding themselves on the stone pavement, but a few.&#xD;
moments to cross the, Plaza and reach the d or of the church.&#xD;
They entered the aisle that led up to the alta , and in the gloom&#xD;
of the early hour could see that there wer but few besides&#xD;
themselves so devotional; and those, kneeli g here and there,&#xD;
scarcely dreamed that the Empress of Mexi o said her matin&#xD;
prayer beside them this morn.&#xD;
The grand altar was still adorned with, he green wreaths&#xD;
and garlands that were festooned about for tle Christmas time.&#xD;
The flowers and red berries were fresh i  the vases, that&#xD;
stood between the massive candelabras;  nd the tall wax&#xD;
tapers, burning with the day, threw a rosy lght on the golden&#xD;
cross above, and the burnished railing below.&#xD;
Already the Archbishop, in his white surplice and violet&#xD;
stole, knelt upon the altar steps, the waiting priest bearing the&#xD;
covered chalice beside him.                  . ~&#xD;
Soleninly the mass was begun, with the * Introit " and the&#xD;
pleading words of the "Kyrie Eleison;" and then the scattered&#xD;
voices were heard in a low murmur, as they fo lowed the Bishop&#xD;
in the, confession of sin. The absolution, as given to the&#xD;
kneeling penitents; the prayer of thanksgivi g offered, and the&#xD;
benediction was pronounced.&#xD;
Silently and apart, the 'pious worshipper passed out, the&#xD;
Empress and Inez ingering for a moment uill all were gone,&#xD;
and then following. As they reached the s eps, a ragged old&#xD;
woman stood there,,and stretched forth a bo y, shrivelled hand&#xD;
for alms.&#xD;
"Seuoritas ! for the sake of the most pur blood of Christ,&#xD;
by the miraculous conception, for the love f the most Holy&#xD;
Virgin, pity and alms ! "&#xD;
This piteous appeal, though in truth but  repetition of the&#xD;
&#xD;
stereotyped phrases of Mexican leperos, touched the good heart&#xD;
of the Empress, who never turned a deaf ear to the poor, and&#xD;
she dropped a shining coin in the woman's palm. The old&#xD;
creature's face lighted with up a grin of delight, and dropping&#xD;
a curtsey and a "God reward you ! " she turned away, chuck-&#xD;
ling at her extraordinary good luck, little dreaming that it&#xD;
was the Empress. to whom she was indebted; for upon the&#xD;
occasions when she went out on foot, Carlotta was the ane as&#xD;
any lady in the capital, always taking care to avoid any inani-&#xD;
festation that would proclaim her rank.&#xD;
"See there! see there, your Majesty ! " cried Inez, stopping&#xD;
suddenly, when they had gone but a few steps further.&#xD;
She pointed to a litter borne, by four soldiers, who, with&#xD;
their burden, were just turning the corner of the street a ead.&#xD;
It seemed.to be the body of a man on the litter, covered entirely&#xD;
by a Mexican blanket.  .&#xD;
It was still quite early, and there were but few on the ilaza.&#xD;
The shopkeepers on the other side were just coming out to open&#xD;
their windows, and array their goods; but just at this moment&#xD;
a man passed near them, and, without thinking, Inez began to&#xD;
question him.&#xD;
".Only a soldier, I believe," said the man, who did not seem&#xD;
to know much about it, "killed by the robbers in the Black&#xD;
Forest last night. Picked up by the diligence from Puebla."&#xD;
" It is he! it is Giulian, your Majesty !" cried Inez, convul-&#xD;
sively grasping the Empress's arm, as they went hastily on to-&#xD;
wards the palace.&#xD;
"Inez !" said the Empress, with an effort to conceal the&#xD;
anxiety which she could not but feel herself "how yoiu let&#xD;
your fears and your imagination run away with you! I{iian&#xD;
is not expected for two days yet. Although he promise you&#xD;
to come, he cannot be here this morning; and then he h's an&#xD;
escort strong enough to defy any number of robbers. No this&#xD;
is, as they say, only some poor imprudentsoldier that has fallen&#xD;
a victim. This Black Forest must be cleared of these terrible&#xD;
bands ! The Emperor must give his attention to it. at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
They had gone in through the court-yard instead of up the&#xD;
front steps; and as they stood together in the corridor before&#xD;
separating, the Empress,.seeing still that. Inez was not satisfied,&#xD;
called after her as she started away.&#xD;
"Inez! you distress me; you need quiet, and we will try to&#xD;
do without you at the palace to-day. Go to Afiita and your&#xD;

uncle, and tell them, I say, send you to us to-morrow, once&#xD;
more, our bright Inez."&#xD;
Inez thanked the Empress, and went up quickly to her own&#xD;
room to make preparations for leaving. She felt that it would&#xD;
do her good to be with Anita to-day, for her heart was not&#xD;
strong enough to enter into the reception, although it was to be&#xD;
a mourning one, that was to be held at the place.&#xD;
The Empress entered the little ante-chamber adjoining her&#xD;
sleeping room. She found the Emperor waiting for her at this&#xD;
unusual hour.&#xD;
" At mass so early?" he said, rising to meet her. "A Happy&#xD;
New Year ! " bending down for a kiss.&#xD;
" A Happy New Year, Maximilian ! Ines and I went this&#xD;
morning to the Cathedral to be sure to begin it well."&#xD;
"Alas, poor Inez !" said the Emperor, as he held out a little&#xD;
ote he held in his hand; "the New Year rises in clouds to her."&#xD;
" How?  What is it?" said the Empress quickly. "What&#xD;
s it?"&#xD;
"This was brought to me a halfhour since, from Colonel&#xD;
Lopez, saying that the diligence frond Puebla, which only got in&#xD;
a few hours ago,,had brought Captain Navarro's body, which was&#xD;
found by the roadside in the Black Forest. Killed by robbers,&#xD;
I suppose. I cannot imagine what could havemade Navarro&#xD;
so imprudent, as to come on without his escort."&#xD;
" Then it was indeed he that we passed, and they were carry-&#xD;
ing him to Don Ruy Gonzales. Inez will know it soon enough,&#xD;
as she has gone already, perhaps." And the Empress related&#xD;
the conversation of the evening before and the morning inci-&#xD;
dent to the Emperor.&#xD;
" Then it must have been that foolish promise to Inez that&#xD;
brought him back yesterday. And his escort, perhaps, wanted to&#xD;
stay in Puebla until the leave of absence was opt, and so Navarro&#xD;
came on alone. Love robs a man of judgment and reason en-&#xD;
tirely. It is the loss of a gallant officer to us. I had deter-&#xD;
mined to take him upon my staff after his  arriage. But I&#xD;
don't understand," continued he, reading over the note in his&#xD;
hand again. "Lopez says 'his horse was brought in, too, and&#xD;
the body was not rifled.' Giulian had no personal enemy that&#xD;
could have done this ?  The bandits must have taken alarm.&#xD;
These robbers must be cleared out, if it takes every soldier&#xD;
in the capital to do it!"&#xD;
" We must send to Inez at once," said t1 e Empress, " ourt&#xD;
sympathy and sorrow within her,"&#xD;
&#xD;
OROW7 JEWELS.                   275&#xD;
" And Navarro must be buried with becoming honors,' said&#xD;
the Emperor, as the Empress opened her writing-case to begin&#xD;
her message to Inez. "Poor fellow ! we shall mis' him&#xD;
greatly."&#xD;
It had required but a few moments for Inez to ma e the&#xD;
necessary changes in her toilet; and she wassoon again n the&#xD;
square, hastening towards her uncle's, which was some di tance&#xD;
off, being near the suburbs of the city.&#xD;
The Plaza was now quite animate with those coming and&#xD;
going. Things seemed to have taken an impetus-with the New&#xD;
Year, and everything wore a busy aspect.&#xD;
Inez hurried on; and it was not long before she turne into&#xD;
the Calle de --, the street in which her uncle lived. The&#xD;
feeling of dread strengthened in her heart; she would soon&#xD;
know the truth; if it was Giulian's body that was upo  the&#xD;
litter, he would be borne at once to her uncle's.&#xD;
As she came nearer, she saw that there was a group o sol-&#xD;
diers standing about the steps that led up to the gallery over&#xD;
the court-yard gate. They were talking earnestly in low ones&#xD;
to each other, and now and then, looking up at the windows,&#xD;
told by their manner that their conversation bore upon hose&#xD;
within.&#xD;
Drawing her -long veil tightly over her face, Inez p ssed&#xD;
hastily up into the gallery; and went by the lazy porter  th-&#xD;
out returning his sleepy morning salutation.&#xD;
Two Imperial officers were walking up and down the 1 ngth&#xD;
of the hall; but, without noticing them, Inez went quickl on,&#xD;
to the farther door of the state drawing-room, which stood ajar.&#xD;
For a moment she stopped, dreading to lift her veil and cross&#xD;
the threshold; dreading to see the confirmation of what sh had&#xD;
felt to be a reality since the night before.&#xD;
At last she went in softly, and closed the door behind still&#xD;
not daring to loo1p  She raised her eyes, and the same  ance&#xD;
that told her there was no'one in the long room save herself,&#xD;
revealed to her a something dark and gloomy, standing be death&#xD;
the arch in the centre. Alas ! those velvet hangings are seen&#xD;
too oft to mistake their name.&#xD;
Upon the bier, in the uniform with which they had cl thed&#xD;
him for the grave, Giulian Navarro lay, still and coldI; and apon&#xD;
the hand that had grasped hers so warm and lovingly but a&#xD;
week ago, Inez caught sight of the token that her brother had&#xD;
Bent, and it delivered its message faithfully.&#xD;
'With a stilled scream, she sprang forward and threw herself&#xD;

eside the dead. A torrent of anguish and grief swept over&#xD;
er soul.&#xD;
"'Oh! that he should have died for one so unworthy ! But I&#xD;
-as not altogether false ! Giulian, I did lqve thee; and I&#xD;
wear to thee here, that, as you gave your life for me, I will&#xD;
evote the rest of mine to your memory. 0 God ! hear me ! "&#xD;
The vow was made, and though there was no echo to it be.&#xD;
ow, no witness to its truth, it was recorded above.&#xD;
All was silent in the drawing-room. The  were alone to-&#xD;
ether -the dead lover, handsome and manly even with the&#xD;
oath pallor on his cheek, a calm, quiet smile upon his lips, and&#xD;
he despairing, grief-stricken woman by his skje.&#xD;
It is a mournful thing to look upon the dust of the departed&#xD;
hen the life-breath has gone out; to look upon, them, so quiet and&#xD;
till, soon t be taken away forever, and to feel that we are pow-&#xD;
rless to awaken them from the deep sleep into which they have&#xD;
allen ; to know that we have no Promethean power to call up&#xD;
ain the beatings of that fond heart, where once we reigned&#xD;
supreme; .to feel as answer to all our passionate avowals of a&#xD;
eturn love, to all our pleadings now for just one word to us,&#xD;
dearest one, still the same deep, awful silence; for our de-&#xD;
s airing grief-plaints cannot reach them amid the voices of the&#xD;
angels and archangels above., We may lay wreaths and offer-&#xD;
ihgs of love about the earth-temple; but the spirit that we wor-&#xD;
'ped has gone to join the high, holy company in the temple&#xD;
'not made with hands..&#xD;
The hours sped on; and still Inez knelt there, pressing that&#xD;
cold hand, with the band of gold upon its finger, close to her&#xD;
eart. She knew with what hate to him and to herself, Juan&#xD;
lhad placed it there, and she could not touch it. It was a ring&#xD;
e had worn from his youth, and had at last served him a cruel&#xD;
urpose. Let it be buried now in the grave with Giulian, as&#xD;
he secret of his murder would be. Anita knew, as herself&#xD;
hat the token meant, but it was not for them to bring him to&#xD;
engeance: leave him to God.&#xD;
At last there was a soft footstep beside her, and Donna Anita&#xD;
ently drew her away.&#xD;
She sat by her all day in her own room, trying to soothe and&#xD;
quiet ~her; 'but neither ventured upon the subject of how&#xD;
iulian had come to his death.&#xD;
.Inez fell into a sleep, and when she awakened, hours&#xD;
emed to have passed; for all was darkness hha quiet around-.&#xD;
he was startled, and looked out, anxosytrying to remember&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JEWELS.Y27&#xD;
where she was, and what had called her from the palace. Anita&#xD;
had fallen asleep in the huge chair by her bedside. Ah.! 'it&#xD;
came sweeping over her now, the mournful reality of her grief,&#xD;
and she buried her head in the pillow. Yes: Giulian was dead;&#xD;
dead forever to the earth, and on the morrow she would bid&#xD;
him adieu until Eternity! She must see him, just once more,&#xD;
to-night.! Rising from her couch, she threw a mantle over&#xD;
the neglige'she wore, and crept softly into the drawing-room.&#xD;
There was but one light, burning dimly in the front. One or&#xD;
two Imperial officers sat near the window; but they wer con-&#xD;
versing together so earnestly, that they did not notice wha was&#xD;
passing behind them.&#xD;
Gently Inez drew back the pall from the face, and be ding,&#xD;
covered the cold brow with kisses. Into the one thatshe&#xD;
pressed upon the dead lips, there was thrown all the long,&#xD;
lingering passionateness of a last "Farewell;" and a  she&#xD;
gazed fondly upon the face, before she drew back the pally and&#xD;
turned herself away, it seemed that she heard again those&#xD;
last loving words, "Inez, thou art my all! " And again she&#xD;
took the vow upon her heart, to devote her life to his memory.&#xD;
The morning came, and before noon a long, solemn tra' of&#xD;
soldiers, with trailing arms, keeping step to the slow beat' g of&#xD;
the muffled drum and the mournful notes of the " Dead Ma ch,"&#xD;
followed the body of the. fallen officer to the cathedral, here&#xD;
solemn masses and holy prayers were offered for the repo e of&#xD;
his soul.&#xD;
Then the services ended; the cortege, followed by a long&#xD;
train of carriages, in the first of which, came the Empero and&#xD;
Empress, moved through the streets towards the little cemetery&#xD;
of " Santa Maria," where he was to be buried.&#xD;
Upon the bier lay the sword, the cap with its plume, once&#xD;
worn so proudly, useless now; and there was the noble teed,&#xD;
that would soon be reined by a stranger's hand, foll wing&#xD;
with the soldier's accoutrements.&#xD;
The procession stopped beside the open grave. Solemy the&#xD;
voice of the priest sounded, as the coffin was lowered, "Dust&#xD;
to dust, ashes to ashes 1" The parting salute was fired by his&#xD;
comrades, the last tribute paid, and Giulian Navarro w  left&#xD;
with the sleepers that wait for Eternity.&#xD;

&#xD;
when, in the autumn of the year just passed, the news came that&#xD;
Juarez had given up, and crossed the Rio Grande into the&#xD;
United States, it was believed that the Empire would have no&#xD;
further trouble.&#xD;
But the military question had been the least consideration&#xD;
with the Emperor since his coming. to Mexico. It was the&#xD;
financial department and its embarrassments that had given his&#xD;
heart most anxious care. He had found the Mexican treasury&#xD;
comparatively empty ; and as the state income did not come&#xD;
up to the government expenses, it was not likely soon to be&#xD;
filled. And there was the support of the army resting upon it;&#xD;
and the immense debt to France, to be discharged by install-&#xD;
ments, the first of which, according to the treaty-between the&#xD;
Emperor Napoleon and the Emperor Maximilian, signed at&#xD;
Miramar, fell due immediately upon the latter's arrival in his&#xD;
empire. It was scarcely possible for the Empire to support it-&#xD;
self, and to meet these immense claims before it had gained a&#xD;
sure footing as a nation. But the Emperor did his utmost.&#xD;
His own salary, and that of his Ministers were reduced to a pal-&#xD;
try sum, when considered with regard to their rank; and every&#xD;
nerve, every sinew was strained to satisfy the - obligations to&#xD;
France. And that power seemed to be content that Mexico's&#xD;
will was good, until outside influences were brought to bear&#xD;
to change the current of her intentions.&#xD;
In the autumn of 1865,,when it was believed throughout the&#xD;
Empire that Juarez had given up the hope of ever establishing&#xD;
his republic, and had left Mexico, there was issued by the Em-&#xD;
peror, with the advice of his- Ministers and at the instance of&#xD;
Marshal Bazaine, as the surest way of at once disarming the&#xD;
remaining band of insurgents, a decree that " all guerilla, or&#xD;
men belonging .to the Juarist party, taken with arms in their&#xD;
hands, should be shot."-&#xD;
This was only giving a retaliative threat to these bandits -.-&#xD;
for they were nothing more- for the many inhumanities and&#xD;
barbarous cruelties that they had practised upon the Imperial&#xD;
soldierswho were so unfortunate as to fall into their hands.&#xD;
When he first came to Mexico, Maximilian had granted a&#xD;
general amnesty and pardon;. and if the turf thrown at&#xD;
them had proven unavailing, now that there was no plausible&#xD;
excuse for holding out against the Empire, which was the de&#xD;
facto government, was it not excusable to throw a few stones?&#xD;
And the four, and only prisoners executed by General Mendez&#xD;
under that order, did but give their blood for that of hundreds&#xD;
&#xD;
that had been shot by the Liberalswho spared, in their ferocity,&#xD;
neither men, women, nor children who favored the cause of&#xD;
the Empire. No one can doubt the magnanimity and generosity&#xD;
of that heart that had spared his enemies from reprisals hereto-&#xD;
fore, and had even pardoned the treacherous Cortina, when he&#xD;
was in his power, and who was now in the field with his force&#xD;
arrayed against him.&#xD;
But, while the Emperor was bending his energies to settle&#xD;
satisfactorily these perplexing questions of Church and State,&#xD;
the Southern Confederacy had fallen before the arms of the&#xD;
North, and the United States had time at last to look about,&#xD;
and see to the status of her neighbors. Senor Romero, the&#xD;
former Minister from Mexico, at Washington, still remained&#xD;
there, and succeeded in claiming the attention of the great&#xD;
power for Mexican affairs. American diplomats at last, were&#xD;
ready to announce, "that the existence of a monarchy, sup-&#xD;
ported chiefly by a foreign power, on the American continent,&#xD;
could not be tolerated. It was an insult to the United States,&#xD;
that France had disregarded her Monroe Doctrine, and she&#xD;
must, now that the United States was at leisure to see to it,&#xD;
withdraw her troops from Mexico, or she should be held to ac.&#xD;
count for it. Let the Empire then stand, if it could, before the&#xD;
Republican party."&#xD;
The Emperor Napoleon, at Paris, gave heed to this threaten-&#xD;
ing message ; and with the Treaty of Miramar, by which it&#xD;
was agreed that "the French troops should remain in Mexico&#xD;
until the Emperor should be able to organize the necessary&#xD;
troops to replace them," staring him full in the face, he still&#xD;
determined to avoid the greater evil; he must not give a&#xD;
" casus belli" to the United States.  Acting upon this, an&#xD;
Imperial commissioner was sent from Paris to Mexico at once,&#xD;
to consult with the commander of the French troops there, in&#xD;
regard to the compliance with these demands ; and to say that&#xD;
the Empire must soon look to herself for sustainment.&#xD;
It was only February, and the commissioner had not yet ar-&#xD;
rived ; but the rumor of his coming, and the withdrawal of the&#xD;
French troops, had flown in before him. All knew what was&#xD;
before the Empire, if France deserted her. She was not yet&#xD;
strong enough to stand alone; and under the patronage of the&#xD;
United States, the Liberal army would gather up again with&#xD;
double strength, and' then -no one dared to look further. A&#xD;
feeling of indignation against France and her- Emperor crept&#xD;
into every heart. Even the French troops themselves cried out&#xD;

against their monarch's broken faith. A thousand surmises&#xD;
arose, as to what would be the action of the young Emperor;&#xD;
and a thousand anxious hearts trembled, lest he, too, should&#xD;
give up Mexico;- and yet, his devotion and nobility convinced&#xD;
them, that he would never forsake them.&#xD;
Count Khevenhuller had been running these things over in&#xD;
his mind, as he sat there with his bbok, which he had in vain&#xD;
tried to read by the dim light of the little lamp on the table be-&#xD;
side him, still in his hand; contrasting the German and the&#xD;
French heart - the faith of one, and that of the other. Per.-&#xD;
haps he wag over partial in his love of country; but he thought,&#xD;
if the worst came to the worst, "he would not give ten of his&#xD;
gallant hussars sleeping just without, in their tents, for a whole&#xD;
regiment of French chassetur-s." The Count was to be par-&#xD;
doned for this unjust estimate, for at this moment ,he was&#xD;
heartily disgusted with everything connected with France.&#xD;
There was a rustling noise near the tent, which aroused the&#xD;
Count from his reverie. He turned, and saw standing in front,&#xD;
with the fly which formed the door half drawn aside, a man,&#xD;
around whose shoulders was thrown A large cloak, which he&#xD;
had drawn up over his head, concealing a brow, from beneath&#xD;
which a pair of piercing black eyes looked out like "lions from&#xD;
their jungles," full into his face.'- A heavy moustache and im-&#xD;
perial told that the stranger had at least caught if not belonging&#xD;
to them, the French style militaire.&#xD;
Count Khevenhiiller reached forward at the unexpected ap-&#xD;
parition, and placed his hand hastily upon his sword, which he&#xD;
had unbuckled, and laid across the table.&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, Count," said the man, coming in and&#xD;
looking anxiously about to see that they were quite alone, be-&#xD;
fore dropping his. cloak, and revealing his Imperial uniform.&#xD;
" It's no midnight ghost or murdered Caesar come to call you&#xD;
to account; though your sins are perhaps not few," he added,&#xD;
smiling, as the Count arose. " Do we need an introduction,&#xD;
or do you know Captain Joubert of the Empress's cavalry ? "&#xD;
" Certainly ! Captain Joubert is no stranger," said the Count&#xD;
with cordiality, offering a seat.&#xD;
"Ah ! yes," said the Captain, "you know my name, but&#xD;
that is about all. We have been neighbors a long while; have&#xD;
seen each other on parade a hundred times; beyond that, we&#xD;
are strangers. This is an unusual hour fot my first visit ; and&#xD;
as it is of a business nature, Ii must of necessity be rather&#xD;
&#xD;
abrupt. Though we know so little of each. other, Count, Itnk&#xD;
we may safely say we are both honest men?"&#xD;
The Count smiled a little incredulously.&#xD;
" Ah ! " said Captain Joubert, noting it, "I am a Frenchman,&#xD;
it is true, and of late 'France's honor is below par here ; but&#xD;
then it is possible for Frenchmen to be honest men. And as I&#xD;
shall have need of your confidence hereafter, perhaps, let me&#xD;
tell you just here, Count, that though born in France, - it was&#xD;
not in Paris, thank God ! where, since this centralization system&#xD;
has gai ed the day, they have concentrated the wickedness and&#xD;
sin of the whole country, but in an humble little cot in Nor-&#xD;
mandy I first saw the light, my father taught me to love my&#xD;
country ; and I was a soldier-boy as soon as I was tall enough to&#xD;
hold a drum..- And even after my poor mother was left a lonely&#xD;
widow, I could not content myself away from the sound of the&#xD;
bugle and fife, and so at last went off to the Crimea. It was&#xD;
only a little affair, that of scaling the wall at Sebastopol, and&#xD;
planting the banner of France ; but it made an ensign of a poor&#xD;
private, and gave me a star ; and helped me to send home a good&#xD;
many more francs a month to the mother that mourned so over&#xD;
her rover. Now she is gone, too ! and here I am in Mexico. I&#xD;
may be a hardened man; but there's a place in my heart that has&#xD;
been kept soft by a mother's prayers, and loves right and jus-&#xD;
tice. Ah ! Count, French soldiers, believe me, are made of very&#xD;
different material from French politicians," he added,"as he&#xD;
brushed a tear aside, and' continued.; "but this is all useless.&#xD;
and you are longing to know what brought me here to-night.&#xD;
Well, nothing, perhaps, after all; only I am in trouble over&#xD;
the record that France is about to send to history.- You love&#xD;
the Emperor Maximilian; and I find myself strangely attached&#xD;
to him. Tell me, what do you think the Emperor Maximilian&#xD;
will do ? Do you think he will accept the invitation that France&#xD;
and the United States will give him, to go back to Mira-&#xD;
mar ?"&#xD;
" Go back to Miramar ?  Captain Joubert, France does not&#xD;
know the man she deals with !. Go back to Miramar ? Never !&#xD;
until his inanimate form is borne there ; and before that comes,&#xD;
this must do its duty," said the Count, laying his hand signifi-&#xD;
cantly upon his sword.&#xD;
"I understand," said the Captain; "there will be rivers of,&#xD;
blood to flow first ! You will fight for this noble.Prince to the&#xD;
death, and so will I. Woe to the day that Mexico loses him !"&#xD;
"Yes !" said the Count: "show us a promise that the Empe-&#xD;

ror has made, that he has not fulfilled, or striven faithfully to&#xD;
do ! He has kept his word and his faith untarnished,; and now,&#xD;
France, at the bidding of this arrogant Republic of the United-&#xD;
States, cares not if he be sacrificed. But I tell you, Captain&#xD;
Joubert, this shall not be ! " continued the Count, excitedly;&#xD;
" the Emperor Maximilian is not a boy, to be trifled with !&#xD;
There may be some deep-laid plot between the United States&#xD;
and France to absorb Mexico, and all this fanfarado now&#xD;
may be a blind, to hide the division of spoils they are looking&#xD;
to, in the future ; or, the United States, since she has gotten&#xD;
through with winding up the Confederacy, which she found&#xD;
rather a tough job, thinks she is powerful enough to browbeat&#xD;
France, and take Mexico herself; but she will find the Empe-&#xD;
ror Maximilian terribly in the way. He may be wronged and&#xD;
deceived by treachery, but he can never be duped! France may&#xD;
take her troops away if she desires to ; the Emperor can still&#xD;
command men, here, and from Austria, to defend his Empire.&#xD;
Our good Francis Joseph will not see him handled roughly.&#xD;
The Austro-Belgian Legion here already, the Mexican regi-&#xD;
ments are all as true as steel; and the sooner Marshal Bazaine,&#xD;
who fetters and trammels the Emperor's movements, and his&#xD;
whole crew, are off, the better ! "                   .&#xD;
" Perhaps," said the Captain, "you are too hard upon Mar-&#xD;
shal Bazaine. He only serves the Emperor Napoleon, whose&#xD;
representative he is here."&#xD;
" Then, let him go ! And let the Emperor Maximilian gather,&#xD;
together his faithful few; let his officers, ministers, and all, be&#xD;
stanch and true, and the EmpireTwill raise its flag triumphant&#xD;
yet," said the Count, hastily.&#xD;
" Ah ! yes," said Captain Joubert, slowly, and looking ear-&#xD;
nestly into the Count's face, "let them be stanch and true /&#xD;
Treachery in high places makes way for it below. If the officers&#xD;
be all loyal, Count Khevenhiler ! "&#xD;
" If, Captain? " said the Count, starting as if the officer had&#xD;
struck some thought of his own, that he had hidden until now.&#xD;
"1If?' Speak out, Captain Joubert ! "&#xD;
The Captain looked around searchingly again to see that they&#xD;
were quite alone; and then, drawing nearer to the Count, he&#xD;
held out his hand, as he said in low, earnest tones,-&#xD;
" Count Khevenhllller, before I go further, there is my hand !&#xD;
There are dark days ahead, I am afraid, for the Mexican Em-&#xD;
pire. But I pledge you here, that, let every Frenchman beside&#xD;
myself go, T will be found at the last fighting under the Empe-&#xD;
&#xD;
ror Maximilian's banner ! What I am about to say to you&#xD;
Count, is not a hasty, immature conclusion;. but I feel that the&#xD;
Emperor stands in danger, not from France alone. ' Judas Iscar-&#xD;
iot went down to disgrace a thousand of years ago, but his&#xD;
spirit still lives, and there are those that will still betray with&#xD;
a kiss."&#xD;
- The Count had risen, and stood by the speaker's side, so that&#xD;
he could catch the whisper to which his voice had fallen.&#xD;
"This is fc-  r ear alone, Count," he continued, "and I am&#xD;
afraid of these      walls, here. It is growing late, and I&#xD;
must be at my du jy, two o'clock, when the guard changes.&#xD;
Since Navarro's death, poor fellow ! te duty comes heavier on&#xD;
the remaining officers. Will you go with me as far as the Ala-&#xD;
meda ? Our encampment is only two or three hundred yards&#xD;
beyond. There is nothing so valuable here, that you are afraid&#xD;
to trust it until you return," he added, taking a careless sur-&#xD;
vey of the camp-stools, soldierly trappings, etc.&#xD;
"No, no ! "said the Count, as they left the tent together;&#xD;
" the esprit du corps is very high among the hussars."&#xD;
"You are quite proud    of your, Hungarians," said the&#xD;
Captain, as. they passed the little tents that shone- whiter&#xD;
than ever in the moonlight ; "and'indeed you have a right&#xD;
to be-they are as brave men as ever fought. But there is&#xD;
your sentry, standing between those trees."&#xD;
The " Halt ! " of the solitary guardsman sounded out on the&#xD;
midnight air. The Count, giving the countersign, passed on&#xD;
with his companion, and the two were soon walking across the&#xD;
graveled road of the Alameda, toward a seat beside a fountain&#xD;
in the distance.&#xD;
The park was deserted. Not a footstep was heard on the&#xD;
pebbly walks, and not a breath- of air stirred the leaves or&#xD;
the branches of the noble trees that stood around. -The two&#xD;
were quite alone.  Captain Joubert was the first to speak.&#xD;
" Count Khevenhiller," said he, " I have come to you, be-&#xD;
cause I know you have the Emperor's interest at heart. Have&#xD;
you an intimate acquaintance with the Colonel under whom I&#xD;
have served for six months past ? Do you know Colonel Miguel&#xD;
Lopez well?"&#xD;
"Do I know him ? " said the Count ,quickly; " hardly well&#xD;
enough to speak advisedly of him. I have seen Colonel Lopez&#xD;
often at the palace, and have been with him on parade. He is,&#xD;

as a relative of his wife, a great favorite with Marshal Bazaine;&#xD;
and enjoys the Emperor's esteem and confidence."&#xD;
"But do you remember, Count, that good human-nature&#xD;
writer who said, 'A man may smile and smile, and be a villain&#xD;
still'?  Colonel Lopez may wear the ribbon of the Legion of&#xD;
Honor, and his heart beat falsely beneath. You have heard&#xD;
it whispered of late, that some of the Ministers were becom-&#xD;
ing disaffected.  I think I would be willing to take oath that&#xD;
one of the officers has been so for months past."&#xD;
"Joubert, let us hear the whole of this ! " said the Count, ris-&#xD;
ing and restlessly walking to and fro for a moment, before he re-&#xD;
sumed his seat. " What is all this ?. Speak out ! "&#xD;
"Listen, Count ; and then form your own conclusions. There&#xD;
have been agencies at work here in our midst, for months&#xD;
past, for Juarez; holding cabals and secret meetings. You know&#xD;
this smooth-lipped, oily-tongued Frenchman, Puillet, of the&#xD;
Cafo de -. He has been in league with these spies ; and they&#xD;
have held their councils in an apartment above the salon, where&#xD;
good Mexicans go to drink the Emperor Maximilian's health.&#xD;
Colonel Lopez and his adjutant, Yablonski, have, to my cer-&#xD;
tain knowledge, attended these meetings within the last two&#xD;
months."&#xD;
"Joubert ! " cried the Count, " can you prove this ? Colonel&#xD;
Lopez has everything in his favor ! A man's reputation must&#xD;
not be assailed lightly."&#xD;
" Can a man trust his own eyes, or do we dream sometimes&#xD;
in waking moments ? You, of course, are ready to ask how I&#xD;
know all this. I have in my command a young Pole, Radetsky&#xD;
by name ; a gallant, handsome fellow, who has been as a bro-&#xD;
ther to me, since we met many years ago ; and we came out to-&#xD;
gether from  France.  Puillet, who keeps the cafe, has a&#xD;
charming little daughter, Mademoiselle Julie, who, it seems,&#xD;
has been quite carried away with Radetsky's brown whiskers&#xD;
and black eyes, and gave him her confidence in return for his&#xD;
little compliments of' bien jolie et ma petite!/' You know how&#xD;
fast these Parisian maidens talk; and in an unguarded moment&#xD;
Mademoiselle confided to her lover, some things, that, if her&#xD;
good pare only knew, he would hang her as high as Haman.&#xD;
She disclosed to Radetsky that secret meetings were held&#xD;
in the third story of her father's house, and had been kept up&#xD;
from time to time for six months past. These important facts&#xD;
Radetsky at once brought to me, and we agreed, that he should&#xD;
persuade Mademoiselle Julie to secrete him, if possible, somne-&#xD;
&#xD;
where near enough to overhear what transpired at the next&#xD;
meeting, as their machinations might bear seriously upon the&#xD;
Empire. Julie at first hesitated, but was finally persuaded, on&#xD;
condition that Radetsky should not come until quite late, and&#xD;
then in some way disguised ; she would meet him at the court-&#xD;
yard gate, and give him his position in the house. Time passed&#xD;
on, and only a week ago Mademoiselle informed Radetsky, who&#xD;
had kept her courage up, that the night had come, and she&#xD;
would see him at twelve, as the meeting was not generally&#xD;
held until the salon was closed below. It was at once deter-&#xD;
mined that I should go in Radetsky's place. We are about the&#xD;
same height, and in this," holding up the long cloak, "and un-&#xD;
der cover of darkness, Julie would never discover us. And as&#xD;
I knew the Ministers of State, and officers, better than he, I&#xD;
would be the best one to- go. So, at twelve, I found myself&#xD;
waiting at the gate of the court-yard. It was very dark, and I&#xD;
could see nothing ; but presently heard a soft voice, 'Emile,&#xD;
are you here ?' The answer I gave was in a whisper, and the&#xD;
girl, taking my hand, led me along through the court-yard, up&#xD;
the steps into the corridor, until we reached a little dark hall&#xD;
or entry leading into a room beyond, which was, I saw, dimly&#xD;
lighted by a single oil-lamp. Hurrying me on, we entered the&#xD;
room, and without waiting to look, Julie pushed me into the&#xD;
recess of a window, over which the long curtains were dropped,&#xD;
and whispering, 'Pll come again for you,' left me in rather a&#xD;
perilous position. As she went through the little hall, I heard&#xD;
the voice of her father calling in coarse French, 'Julie ! ' and&#xD;
her answer, 'I have just carried a lamp, as you bade me.' It&#xD;
was not long before they came in; Puillet, followed by near a&#xD;
dozen others, all of whom were strangers, save two, -and they&#xD;
-- I almost cried out then as I recognized the Colonel and&#xD;
Adjutant of'my own regiment! "&#xD;
" Joubert, is this a well-laid story you are hatching?  Lopez&#xD;
and Yablonski ! " cried Count Khevenhiller, earnestly ; "let us&#xD;
come to the end of this! ,Go on! "&#xD;
"Yes: Lopez and Yablonski were there, and discussed the&#xD;
certainty of the French troops being withdrawn, and the military&#xD;
movements projected by Juarez, and the probable force the Em-&#xD;
peror could command to meet him. I am convinced from what&#xD;
I heard, that Col. Lopez is planning for his own elevation if&#xD;
the Empire falls. As I tell you, he was at this meeting, and&#xD;
left none of -the details of the pverty of the Empire untold.&#xD;
I have no&amp;amp; been able to look upon the man's face with patience&#xD;

since ! After an hour or more, old Puillet gave the signal for&#xD;
adjournment, and, like the thieves of justice and honor they are,&#xD;
they all followed him out into the darkness. I waited impa'&#xD;
tiently enough, my heart burning to tell Radetsky what I had&#xD;
seen; but a half-hour passed, and I was just concluding Julie&#xD;
had forgotten me, when I heard her light footsteps, and her&#xD;
whisper, ' Come quickly!' Old Puillet had taken the lamp, and so&#xD;
we were in the darkness; but we made our way in a few seconds&#xD;
safely down to the court-yard, and on to the gate, where, after&#xD;
a hurried kiss to Julie, and a whisper for Radetsky, that 'I&#xD;
would come to-morrow,' I hurried away, my heart filled with&#xD;
a thousand emotions, to our encampment, where I found&#xD;
Radetsky on guard. We have each kept our own counsel. At&#xD;
this time of perplexity, it may be well enough not to trouble&#xD;
the Emperor with this; but it is left with you, Count., You&#xD;
have his Majesty's ear ; and I am willing .to substantiate my&#xD;
words with my blood."&#xD;
" This is a terrible business, Joubert ! " said the Count, as if&#xD;
lost in deep thought. "Lopez, Lopez, upon whom the Emper-&#xD;
or has heaped so many favors, to whose child he is godfather,&#xD;
- whom he loves like a-brother - Lopez unfaithful ! "&#xD;
"Great events work out from very little things; this girl&#xD;
has given us, perhaps, the means to save the Emperor much&#xD;
trouble in the future."&#xD;
" Captain," said the Count, abstractedly, " keep your eye on&#xD;
Col. Lopez and this fellow Yablonski; but remember, as you&#xD;
have said, that Radetskyland yourself keep your own counsel.&#xD;
I will see what is to be done about it. It is the lion's claw in&#xD;
the gant de velour, but we will try and keep it from clutch-&#xD;
ing anything very valuable. If you discover anything more,&#xD;
let me hear from you. - You are an honest fellow, Joubert ! "&#xD;
The convent bell struck two..&#xD;
" Hear !" cried the Captain, "like the murdered King of Den-&#xD;
mark, my time is out; the guard is changed at two, and, as I&#xD;
am officer on duty, I must be getting in. Good-night, Count.",&#xD;
. Joubert drew the cloak up about his face again, and going in&#xD;
and out between the trees of the avenue leading across the&#xD;
park, was soon lost to sight. A queer mixture he was of hen-&#xD;
esty and candor; a rough, " dare-brute, dare-devil" specimen,&#xD;
whose heart became thoroughly enlisted in the cause he espoused,&#xD;
and who, with all his careless indifference, would die for the&#xD;
right. Ready for any wild escapade that was gotten up by the&#xD;
soldiers to break the monotony of their life, he was an universal&#xD;
&#xD;
favorite among them; and fortune had given him so many hard&#xD;
strokes in life, that he was full of sympathy for others. This&#xD;
united with his reputation for bravery and courage, increased&#xD;
the admiration and love with which he was regarded by his&#xD;
comrades in arms.. In the reorganization of the army, he, al-&#xD;
though a French officer, had been given a command in Colonel&#xD;
Lopez's regiment, which had been stationed at Mexico for&#xD;
months.&#xD;
Count Khevenhiiller stood for a few moments where Captain&#xD;
Joubert had left him, and then began a Napoleonic promenade&#xD;
up and down the avenue, turning over again and again in his&#xD;
mind the revelations he had just heard.&#xD;
He hardly entertained a shadow of doubt as to the truth of&#xD;
Joubert's statements; the question was, "What was his duty&#xD;
as a faithful follower of the Emperor, in the matter ?  Go to&#xD;
him at once and tell him of Lopez's duplicity, prove these charges&#xD;
against him, and let the consequences be what they would ? No :&#xD;
this would cause an open rupture, perhaps, with Bazaine, who,&#xD;
as related to Lopez, would of course endeavor to shield him&#xD;
from public disgrace; and then, too, just at this time the Em-&#xD;
peror was so perplexed and worn out, with the Freneh status,&#xD;
that it would be unkind to destroy his faith in those around&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The Count determined that he, too, as well as Joubert, would&#xD;
keep an eye on Colonel Lopez. He knew that it would l1e months&#xD;
before Juarez could gather force enough to seriou ly Ithreaten&#xD;
the Empire, and until it came to a pointed issue, Lopez's infor-&#xD;
mation could not do him much good. In the meantime, he would&#xD;
go to him and fetter his movements for the future by letting&#xD;
him know, that he was not working altogether in the dark. It&#xD;
would be time enough to mention all this to the Emperor, when&#xD;
it was really dangerous to trust Colonel Lopez; but at present, it&#xD;
would have a bad effect, not only in Mexico, but in the world, to&#xD;
discover that the Emperor's bosom friend, as it were, was play-&#xD;
ing him false."&#xD;
Folding his arms across his chest, and for the first time not-&#xD;
ing the chilliness of the night-air, after forming these conclu-&#xD;
sions, the Count, too, left the Alameda, and made his way to&#xD;
wards his tent.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
SOUNT KHEVENHULLER            of the Hussars!" said&#xD;
the adjutant to Colonel Lopez, opening the door of his&#xD;
private office in the city.&#xD;
Colonel Lopeze looked up from the morning paper, in&#xD;
which he seemed much interested, and removing his lighted cigar&#xD;
simply called, Show the Count in!"&#xD;
In a few moments the door was again opened, and Count&#xD;
Khevenhiiller was ushered in.&#xD;
My dear Count s! "said the Colonel, rising and going forward&#xD;
with extended hand to meet him, "how delighted Iam to see&#xD;
you! It is not often you pay me this compliment. Indeed,"&#xD;
he added, as he offered the Count a large chair beside the table,&#xD;
strewn with papers and writing material, "it seems to me, to&#xD;
be such a young, handsome man, with everything so in your&#xD;
favor, that you hold yourself singularly aloof. I know a score&#xD;
of senoritas here in the capital, that would give their diamonds&#xD;
to see you follow Marshal Bazaine's example, and marry in the&#xD;
Empire; but you are a perfect iceberg!7"-&#xD;
"Indeed?" replied the Count, hardly pleased with Colonel&#xD;
Lopez's facetious flattery, "though,I lay claim to be not much&#xD;
of a court follower or attendant upon fashion just now, I trust&#xD;
the Emperor has no charge to bring against me for want of de-&#xD;
votion to him."&#xD;
"Ah, no!" said Colonel Lopez. "You are all right there;&#xD;
and doubtless your heart already has been laid before a worthy&#xD;
shrine in Bohemia ; for Sappho's muse comes to every one once&#xD;
in a lifetime. But how are things going now, Count?  Have&#xD;
you seen the Diario this mornmg? Salliard, the French Com-&#xD;
missioner, has arrived, and I suppose we are to hear France's&#xD;
zpse dixito I am afraid Louis Napoleon will not hold out for&#xD;
the Emperor..&#xD;
Count Khevenhiiller looked into Colonel Lopez's face. His&#xD;
eyes were bent upon the paper, searching for the announcement&#xD;
of Baron Salliard's arrival and the editorial comments thereon.&#xD;
Could it , e possible, he thought, that this man was the mid-&#xD;
night traitor? So full of pleasant words, such genial bearing,&#xD;
&#xD;
such seeming candor and sincerity?  Was it not possible that&#xD;
Joubert might have been mistaken? But then he remembered&#xD;
the pointed quotation, the honest old captain had used,- "A&#xD;
man may smile and smile, and be a villain still!"  If Lopez was&#xD;
playing double, he would find it out before he left that office ;&#xD;
for he defied him, to baffle his ability to read human character,&#xD;
and he should pass the ordeal of his.scrutin this morning.&#xD;
"Who cares," he replied, suddenly remehering Col. Lopez's&#xD;
last comment, " who cares whether he holds out or not ?  The&#xD;
Emperor Maximilian is not a pensioner upon France; and there&#xD;
are other troops in the world beside French soldiers. If they&#xD;
all go the Foreign Legion and all, there are already organized&#xD;
at San Luis Potosi, ten thousand native troops .under skilful&#xD;
officers, and the Emperor holds the balance of power, in having&#xD;
possession of the rich central States."&#xD;
" But," said Colonel Lopez, "you forget, that if the French&#xD;
troops are withdrawn, it will leave these States liable to be over-&#xD;
run at anytime. You know the Liberals have Diaz, Escobedo,&#xD;
Co-tina to lead them."&#xD;
"nd the Emperor has.Meija, Mendez, and Garcia," replied&#xD;
the Count. " We shall have the summer to prepare in, for the&#xD;
campaign cannot begin for some months yet. The sooner France&#xD;

"But the Emperor does not seem to look so lightly upon this,&#xD;
Count, as the soldiers do. There is a rumor, you know, that&#xD;
General Almonte, who is well known at the French Court, is&#xD;
to be sent to Paris on a special mission."&#xD;
" Let him go," said the Count. "But it will do no good.&#xD;
The Emperor Maximilian, who is the soul of honor himself,&#xD;
cannot be expected to look lightly upon, or. comprehend in a&#xD;
moment, the total want of faith in an ally whom he had .never&#xD;
doubted. The Emperor is unprepared for treachery, and if&#xD;
we wore in country where it was not a spontaneous growth, I&#xD;
should ' ie my life that our Emperor would triumph over every-&#xD;
thing - at I am afraid that it will lurk in his path even here.&#xD;
If he iean but keep his own true!"&#xD;
Cou: .t Khevenhuller turned his eyes carelessly towards Colonel&#xD;
Lopez and let them rest upon his face. He noticed, he thought,&#xD;
a momentary paling as he spoke ; but his reply came very&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;

"I should not like to be too definite or premature, Colonel&#xD;
Lopez, said the Count, assuming a confidential air; "but there&#xD;
are proofs of a want of faith, in a quarter where it would be least&#xD;
suspected."&#xD;
Where, - where, Count Khevenhuller ? " whispered Lopez,&#xD;
drawing his chair nearer, and looking anxiously and earnestly&#xD;
into the Count's face. "You astound me ! "he added, trying in&#xD;
vain to conceal his anxiety.&#xD;
Count Khevenhuller. did not take his eyes from Colonel&#xD;
Lopez s face as he replied,&#xD;
"bu am afraid I am hardly at liberty yet to mention names,&#xD;
but it will perhaps not be imprudent to say that there has been&#xD;
a secret cabal, holding meetings, and organized by spies from the&#xD;
Liberal army, in this city for months past." Colonel Lopez&#xD;
Was biting his lips, and his face seemed to wear a whiter hue.&#xD;
Yes," continued the Count, growing more convinced, as he&#xD;
notd his change of expression, and determined to probe him&#xD;
e quick, and at these midnight meetings there have been&#xD;
seen men who, in the daylight, wear the Imperial uniform, and&#xD;
are respected as true and faithful."&#xD;
Have been seen / have been seen, Count Khevenh "ller?"&#xD;
cried Lopez, earnestly, forgetting the part that he was playing;&#xD;
Who can prove this ? who is this traitor? It must be Mira-&#xD;
mon, or General.      "_&#xD;
"Stop, stop, Col. Lopez," cried the Count, drawing towards&#xD;
e officer, whose emotion was so intense that it was of itself&#xD;
proof against him; "don't slander honest men! We can come&#xD;
nearer the man than that. The name whispered to me was that&#xD;
of Colonel Mfguel Lopez I"&#xD;
"False, false !  cried Lopez, excitedly rising; "and I defy&#xD;
.  proof to be produced! Who says that it can be done, lies&#xD;
in his throat!"&#xD;
Count Khevenhiiller had taken a step- back, as Lopez rose,&#xD;
but he only answered his words,' so full of passion and rage&#xD;
in the same calm, impassive manner as before.&#xD;
" Stay, Colonel Lopez; do not further betray yourself. You&#xD;
now this is truth ; and, if your' reputation is destroyed, it&#xD;
will be your own deeds, that will give it the death-blow. You&#xD;
are safe now, and it is not too late to preserve yourself. These&#xD;
meetings that you and your friend have attended are watched.&#xD;
mperor at present knows nothing about them."&#xD;
"And, Count Khevenhiiller, I dare you," cried Lopez, inter-.&#xD;
rupting him, and raising a pistol that he had wrested from his&#xD;

side until it was on a level with Count Khevenhnller's heart,&#xD;
"I dare you-I dare any one, to whisper these -things, that are&#xD;
infamous falsehoods, against me, to the Emperor! Breathe&#xD;
it again, and your life must pay for it ! I could kill you this&#xD;
distant Count KhevenhUller, where you stand ! "&#xD;
There was not a muscle in Count Khevenhnller's face that&#xD;
mved, but, looking straight into Colonel Lopez's eye, a low sar-&#xD;
motic laugh came from his lips as he reached out his hand.&#xD;
"Ha! ha:! Lopez! And you think to frighten me into&#xD;
silence with that little weapon? You dare no more kill me&#xD;
now than you dare put the muzzle against your own brain, and&#xD;
plunge yourself his instant into eternity. Put up your pistol,&#xD;
Colonel Lopez, and feel safe, as I told you, for the present.&#xD;
There are but few who know this beside myself, and these few&#xD;
wish you no more harm than you deserve. The Emperor will not&#xD;
hear it, if this - treason, shall we call it ? - goes no further ;&#xD;
but remember, Col. Lopez, there is an eye on you. These men,&#xD;
who think they hold their meetings unsuspected, may plot and&#xD;
plan, but they will never be permitted to strike. ' The best-&#xD;
laid schemes of mice and men gang aft aglee.' Good-morning,&#xD;
Colonel Lopez! "&#xD;
With a courteous bow, Count Khevenhiiller left the room.&#xD;
For some moments Colonel Lopez sat, almost palsied in mind&#xD;
from the wor s he had just heard. " Seen -suspected - disco-&#xD;
veredi! " He laid his pistol down beside him, and his head&#xD;
sank upon the table, and in tones husky and low, the words fell&#xD;
from his lips,-&#xD;
" Undone ! undone ! "&#xD;
But a sudden thought seemed to strike him, that gave new&#xD;
hope to his heart, and, rising quickly, he walked to and fro the&#xD;
length of the little room. At last he exclaimed, -&#xD;
"Khevenhuller shall be checkmated! Next week my-regiment&#xD;
is sent to Puebla, and adieu for the present to this surveillance.&#xD;
In the future, Lopez shall be the truest of, the Emperor's follow-&#xD;
ers, and above suspicion; and, my good Count, I hardly think,&#xD;
with all your influence with the Emperor, that you could root me&#xD;
out of his confidence in a day! Ha, ha! But how under heaven&#xD;
has this dropped out ? Old Puillet's neck must be wrung before&#xD;
I get away! Lopez will show these proud Germans that he can&#xD;
be elevated and dictate terms, too ; but he must labor cautiously,&#xD;
and wait. If the Empire fails and Juarez succeeds, it will .be&#xD;
worth the trouble: the reward will come then. Ha, ha I"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
   ARONSALLIARD had arrived at the capital; and the&#xD;
many rumors that had preceded him in regard to his&#xD;
mission and its probable effect upon the Empire were put&#xD;
at rest, when it became known that he bore instructions&#xD;
to M. Dano, the French Minister at Mexico, and Marshal Ba-&#xD;
zaine, the military commander, from His Majesty the Emperor&#xD;
of France, that the withdrawal of the French troops should be-&#xD;
gin early in the following autumn, and be accomplished as soon&#xD;
as possible. It was further added that, "The Emperor of Mexico,&#xD;
having failed- to keep the Treaty of Miramar, in providing for&#xD;
French claims, could not expect France to hold herself under&#xD;
further obligation to sustain the Empire. However, the Emper-&#xD;
or of France would always feel the deepest sympathy with the&#xD;
Sovereign of Mexico." The Emperor Maximilian, unprepared&#xD;
as he was for such total want of faith in his Imperial ally, could&#xD;
not at once take in the idea that France had so suddenly aban-&#xD;
donedl the Government which she herself had established,&#xD;
simply because of the threats of the United States ; for, dis-&#xD;
guise the truth as he would, this stood out a bare fact, at&#xD;
the cause of Napoleon's sudden change of, policy.&#xD;
As the steps to facilitate the evacuation must be taken as&#xD;
once, it was necessary to discuss the situation with his council&#xD;
and the officers at the capital.&#xD;
It was a solemn meeting that was called together in the Cabi-&#xD;
net at the Imperial Palace. Each felt, as they took their seats,&#xD;
that before they left, the fate of the Empire would be decided.&#xD;
Never had the young Emperor's heart been so burdened with&#xD;
care, or his face so clouded by anxiety ; and as he entered the&#xD;
cabinet-chamber, and saw the troubled look that rested on the&#xD;
countenance of his Ministers and officers, he knew that they,&#xD;
too, felt the weight of coming-dire events.,&#xD;
M. Lacunza presided at the meeting. There was Marshal&#xD;
Bazaine and M. Dano as representatives of France; and, besides&#xD;
the regular members of the Cabinet, Colonel Lopez and Count&#xD;
Khevenhaller, on the part of the army, were present.&#xD;
M. Lacunza, the President, opened the meeting. He began&#xD;
&#xD;
by calling the attention of all, and setting forth in a clear, candid&#xD;
manner, the political, financial, and military situation of the&#xD;
Empire ; its terrible- poverty, which had not only prevented its&#xD;
keeping its promise of settling French claims, but put it even out&#xD;
of its power to pay its own troops, who were therefore becom-&#xD;
ing dissatisfied. A true patriot was -M. De Lacunza, and as&#xD;
such he spake out.&#xD;
"G entlemen," he continued, as he finished his detail. of. the&#xD;
evils that would fall upon the Empire by the failure of the French&#xD;
co-operation, "these things are apparent to all. It is useless to&#xD;
prolong the sad picture of our poverty. The qv.estion is for the&#xD;
remedy ! France established this Empire. A large portion of&#xD;
the Mexican nation, who had been educated with republican&#xD;
principles, accepted a monarchy because they expected it to be a&#xD;
permanent Goveiinment. Up to this time, France has acted in&#xD;
good faith; but now, just when troubles press heaviest, when the&#xD;
United States declares for the enemies of the Empire, France&#xD;
has no right to desert her. I repeat it ; this is a Government&#xD;
established by France ! The Emperor Maximilian accepted the&#xD;
chief rulership, and has labored conscientiously and faithfully&#xD;
to build up .the Empire, and -that he has not performed the&#xD;
miracle of financiering which ithwould have taken to have sus-&#xD;
tained himself and met outside claims, does not furnish a&#xD;
shadow of pretext for the message the Emperor Napoleon sends&#xD;
to us: 'We have ao more men nor money for Mexico !   We&#xD;
ask ourselves, can this be true ? We can carcely credit it&#xD;
as coming from the Cabinet that has heretofore been our stanch&#xD;
support. But these messages, unfortunately, are not borne to us&#xD;
by the wind, as treacherous echoes, but come through special&#xD;
commissioners accredited from the Tuileries. No, gentlemen, it&#xD;
is no fault of Mexico that causes the policy of Frahce to be so&#xD;
suddenly changed : it is the voice of the United States calling&#xD;
loudly for the destruction of the Empire ; and, as a preliminary&#xD;
step thereto, urges the withdrawal of France's support!  The&#xD;
Union gives its orders. The question is - will France meekly&#xD;
ob~ey them, as she is now preparing to do ?",&#xD;
There was a solemn silence as the speaker waited- a moment&#xD;
for each one to take in the force of his words, and then con-&#xD;
tinued:-&#xD;
"W1ere is the spirit that animated France in 1864, when, in&#xD;
reply to the vote of Congress against the monarchy of Mexico,&#xD;
she simply asked of the American Reopresentative,''Do you bring&#xD;

us peace or war?' Is the United States to be so much more&#xD;
dreaded now than then?&#xD;
" We come back to the same point in the end ; shall I&#xD;
come out boldly and say what it is that threatens to engulf the&#xD;
Empire?   It is bankruptcy! It is money, to arm and equip&#xD;
and sustain the troops she has, that Mexico needs; and how is it&#xD;
to be raised? His Majesty, our noble Emperor, and the Min&#xD;
isters have furnished an example of economy, by reducing&#xD;
their private expenses..- The Empress Carlotta, who is the&#xD;
jewel of the Crown, prefers rather to dispense with the pomp and&#xD;
grandeur of royalty, than purchase it at the cost of her people.&#xD;
If we can but weather through the coming storm, the Empire&#xD;
will in the end be a grand success! The idea of its establish-&#xD;
ment reflects credit upon the intellect that conceived it and will&#xD;
it now be abandoned, and given up entirely for the want of a&#xD;
few more advances from the French treasury ? This is the&#xD;
question that France must now decide!"&#xD;
M. Lacunza took his seat beside the Emperor Maximilian,&#xD;
who leaned his head upon his hand, so that none could see the&#xD;
terrible struggle that was going on within as he listened to. the&#xD;
discussion. M. Lacunza had kept back none of the embarrass-&#xD;
ments that beset them on every side; and the Emperor waited&#xD;
now for the answer of M. Dano, the French Minister.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said he, rising "as the representative of&#xD;
France, I am forced to make answer this morning, to any&#xD;
charges that may be brought against her. Baron Salliard has&#xD;
but just left us to return to Paris, and the nature of his in-&#xD;
structions are not unknown. In answer to M. Lacunza's-&#xD;
questions as to what France will do for the Empire in the&#xD;
future, I can but refer to the dispatches of M. Dhrouyn de&#xD;
L'Huys, who speaks for the Emperor of France, and who sim-&#xD;
ply lays down as our course, that 'there are t6. be no more ad-&#xD;
vances made to Mexico, and that Marshal Bazaine is to make&#xD;
all necessary arrangements with the Emperor Maximilian, for&#xD;
the withdrawal of the French troops the coming autumn.'&#xD;
This is the only answer we can make to M. L cunza, except, to&#xD;
add the repeated assurances of the Emperor  apoleon's good-&#xD;
will and sympathy."&#xD;
A smile ran over the faces of those who heard this mockery,&#xD;
as it seemed to them, in their troubles: the offering of stones,&#xD;
instead of bread to a starving man; but the slight curl of the&#xD;
lip did not linger long upon M. Lacunza's face, as, his brow&#xD;
&#xD;
flushing and his voice betraying unwonted emotion, he ex-&#xD;
claimed, -&#xD;
"W hat! is this the way in which France thinks to dispose&#xD;
of the whole matter ? While she spends millions for the&#xD;
empty show of an Exposition, is Mexico to be left to drown?&#xD;
No! it was France that asked the people of Mexico to give&#xD;
up the Republic; to accept the Empire, and the Emperor Max-&#xD;
imilian as their ruler; and France must sustain it! .This&#xD;
treaty of Miramar is ' between the Emperor Napoleon and the&#xD;
Emperor Maximilian;' but Fruce owes it the people of&#xD;
Mexico to sustain the Government, and in their name I boldly&#xD;
demand five million francs monthly, for the expenses, until&#xD;
Mexico can do more towards supporting herself! At present&#xD;
all is tumult and confusion. The cry of'Long live the Northern&#xD;
Intervention' is already the rallying shout for Juarez; and,&#xD;
under the conviction that France is going to sacrifice the Em-&#xD;
pire, even those who would support it think it more politic to&#xD;
make friends with those who are to triumph. But this must&#xD;
not be ! France surely does not realize our true position!"&#xD;
" M. Lacunza! " cried the Emperor,. suddenly breaking&#xD;
through his calmness, and interrupting him, " further detail or&#xD;
comment is unnecessary! The whole thing may be summed&#xD;
up in a very few words; -it is either bankruptcy of the Em-&#xD;
pire or the hope of saving it. If the personages who repre-&#xD;
sent France at this meeting are not willing to take the respon-&#xD;
sibility of spending a few millions, they must take that of hav-&#xD;
ing allowed bankruptcy to intervene, which assuredly would&#xD;
not be the desire of the Emperor Napoleon, who has always&#xD;
shown himself to be the friend of the Mexican Empire."&#xD;
"But," said M. Diano, "perhaps your Majesty forgets, that,&#xD;
as we have stated before, we have no discretion of our own,&#xD;
and are compelled, however much we may desire to lend aid&#xD;
to Mexico, to carry out our instructions. We have faithfully&#xD;
endeavored to acquaint the Emperor Napoleon with the evils&#xD;
that would follow the course of policy he has adopted, and the&#xD;
probable downfall of the. Empire; so that we cannot presume&#xD;
upon His Majesty's ignorance of the situation. It has been&#xD;
suggested -though I hardly know that I should mention it&#xD;
here  that: as the Faperor of France sees that the establish-&#xD;
ment and sustainment- of this Empire is to be a profitless in-&#xD;
vestment for him, it will be so to the Emperor Maximilian&#xD;
likewise. Even the most sanguine of the Imperialists hardly&#xD;
hope for success, if the French troops are withdrawn. ' The&#xD;

Emperor Maximilian has the same remedy to save himself,'&#xD;
says the Emperor Napoleon, 'as we have. Let him, too, with-&#xD;
draw; let him not struggle on and waste his energies in vain;&#xD;
let him abdicate, and go )ack to Miramar, when the troops&#xD;
leave the soil of Mexico; and say to this people, that will not&#xD;
help to sustain any government, 'to manage themselves.' This,&#xD;
gentlemen, was the tenor of Baron Salliard's verbal instruc-&#xD;
tions, and I lay it before you this morning."&#xD;
Had a thunderbolt fallen in their very midst, it could not&#xD;
have startled the members of the assembly more than did M.&#xD;
Dano's words. As he took his seat, each one, with various&#xD;
emotions playing upon their features, looked into the face of&#xD;
the other. The Empire to be entirely given up and abandoned!&#xD;
All the time, money, and labor expended on it -all the hopes&#xD;
and prayers for-its success offered in vain ! Given up while&#xD;
there was a man left to raise and defend its standard? Never!&#xD;
"Gentlemen! " cried Count Khevenlifiller, in a voice that&#xD;
trembled with excitement, "what does the Emperor Napo..&#xD;
leon mean by adding insult to the injuries he has already.&#xD;
contemplated for Mexico?  Does he think that France can&#xD;
build up and destroy governments at her bidding?  No! Let&#xD;
France 'do as she will,. those that remain will stand by the&#xD;
Empire to the end; our good Emperor cannot be daunted so&#xD;
easily, thank God ! He is of a House that knows no such&#xD;
word as fail."&#xD;
" Yes! " cried the Emperor, with a mixture of indignation&#xD;
and determination, " a Hapsburg never deserts his post! We&#xD;
thank the Emperor of France, that he has so kindly taken our&#xD;
personal safety into consideration, but his suggestion does not&#xD;
accord with our ideas of honor ; and we say, 'Welcome battle,&#xD;
and strife ; aye, and welcome death and defeat-but, dishonor-&#xD;
never !' Who is it," continued the Emperor, his eye flashing&#xD;
and his lips curling, as he felt in the depth of his soul the&#xD;
words he uttered, - " who is it that would say to us, to&#xD;
ignominiously and disgracefully abandon a people that had&#xD;
placed trust in us?  Abdicate?  Perish the, thought! No:&#xD;
the Empire of Mexico shall stand without the help of France.&#xD;
Gentlemen, you who will stand by my side to the bitter end,,&#xD;
you , who have watched with me faithfully so far shall not&#xD;
the Empire live?"&#xD;
As the Emperor stood there, his hand raised, and his face&#xD;
glowing with emotion, every one of the Mini~ters caught his&#xD;
patriotic spirit, and started to their feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Live ? " cried Colonel Lopez, drawing his sword and laying it&#xD;
with a clash on the table in front of the Emperor. "While&#xD;
there is a hand to^ draw a blade, while there is a voice to cry&#xD;
out 'Vive l'Empereur !' your Majesty will be sustained !"&#xD;
" Gentlemen," said M. Lacunza, who, as President of the&#xD;
Council, thought it best to change the- exciting turn it was&#xD;
taking, "his Majesty knows full well, that, as Colonel .aopez says,&#xD;
while there is a hand among us to draw a sword for the Em-&#xD;
're it shall be done ; and, doubtless, the day is to come when&#xD;
we shall be called to seal these words on the battlefield; but&#xD;
it is our duty this morning to decide 'our relations with&#xD;
France -to know how far we may rely upon her, in our present&#xD;
emergency. We must have money, now, for the support of the&#xD;
army ; the question is, whether France will give it. It is not&#xD;
necessary to repeat our pressing necessities to the gentlemen&#xD;
who represent France: they are known to the good Marshal&#xD;
Bazaine but too well; will he not take the .responsibility of&#xD;
acting on his own discretion to-day?"&#xD;
Hitherto Marshal Bazaine had, preserved an unmoved&#xD;
silence, but this direct appeal called for. an answer. It was&#xD;
with the greatest embarrassment and sadness that he met the&#xD;
question. lie and the Emperor~ Maximilian were personal&#xD;
friends. Since their stay in Mexico, they had counseled and&#xD;
advised. together in all plans for the good of the Empire, but&#xD;
now their paths divided. Though all his sympathies lay with&#xD;
the Emperor of Mexico, his duty to his sovereign forbade him&#xD;
to hold out now a helping hand. He appreciated Maximilian's&#xD;
natural and just indignation at the sudden desertion of France,&#xD;
and yet he must keey silent.&#xD;
As he rose to make answer to M. Lacunza, a shadow of sad-&#xD;
hess clouded his brow.&#xD;
" Gentlemen," said he, slowly, "I have been with you. even&#xD;
longer than your noble Emperor. I know every hope, every&#xD;
dream that has filled the heart of the Mexican patriot since the&#xD;
establishment of the Empire; and you will believe me, when&#xD;
I say to you, that I sorrow to see the beautiful Temple of&#xD;
Liberty that we were rearing together, tottering to its very&#xD;
base. Though here as the representative of France, I think&#xD;
there .is not one among you who has labored more zealously for&#xD;
Mexico; and to hear her calling to-day, through M. Lacunza,&#xD;
to one who loves-her as a brother, for 'help, help! '-to know&#xD;
that she is suffering, perishing, while I have -it in my reach and&#xD;
am forbidden to give,' wrings my heart ! I ask mysel ,is it guit,&#xD;

is it theft in the mother, who takes from another's plenty, to&#xD;
bring back life to her starving child ? - I ask myself this, and&#xD;
my heart gives way !  So long-as I am with you, I cannot hear&#xD;
the voice of Mexico in vain. M. Lacunza asks for a monthly&#xD;
advance of five million francs. It is out of my power to grant&#xD;
so much; but I pledge myself, to place one-half that sum at his&#xD;
disposal, until the Emperor Maximilian can send a special com-&#xD;
missioner to Paris, to receive His Majesty's final and irrevo-&#xD;
cable decision- concerning the action of France. Gentlemen,&#xD;
,I can do no more, and I run the risk of incurring the displea-&#xD;
sure of my sovereign for even this transgression of orders."&#xD;
Marshal Bazaine. was seated, and there was silence for a&#xD;
moment, as they all took in the proposition of a last and special&#xD;
commissioner being sent to France.&#xD;
" Mexico, my dear Marshal," said M. Lacunza, "can only&#xD;
set this as one more to the long list of obligations she owes to&#xD;
you; but it is for our Emperor to decide whether this commis-&#xD;
sioner shall be sent to the Tuileries.'&#xD;
"Yes," said the Emperor, rousing himself from deep thought,&#xD;
and contracting his brow, "though I think it perhaps useless,&#xD;
let General Almonte, already so well known to the Emperor&#xD;
Napole6n, go to France, and insist that he agrees at least to&#xD;
.the guarantees set forth in the Treaty of Miramar. But in the&#xD;
interim," continued the Emperor, turning to the Minister of&#xD;
War, "let us rouse ourselves, let us gather strength,! so that&#xD;
when the worst comes to the worst, we can meet it with the&#xD;
nerve of a Spartan Leonidas."&#xD;
The' Council ended its meeting; and a few days later Gen-&#xD;
eral Almonte, who had been near the Emperor since his first&#xD;
coming to Mexico, left for Paris.&#xD;
The young Emperor, and the Empress too, -for Carlotta took&#xD;
a deep interest, and an active part in all the private counsel-&#xD;
ings, --set to work in earnest to prepare for a coming storm; .&#xD;
for though they would hang a hope upon the slender thread of&#xD;
General Almonte's success; yet they felt there was-small chance&#xD;
of help from France -now.&#xD;
Marshal Bazaine, though confident that it was already de-&#xD;
cided in France that he should .leave Mexico with his troops,&#xD;
did not in the least' relax his efforts to increase the effective&#xD;
force of the Empire ; but, in conjunction with- the Emperor,&#xD;
succeeded in raising new battalions, placing them under skil.&#xD;
ful officers, and assigning them to duty where most needed. '&#xD;

So the spring crept on. Though surrounded by troubles,&#xD;
anxieties, and cares, trembling at each message that came to&#xD;
them from abroad, the Emperor Ma imilian and Empress&#xD;
Carlotta never once displayed a touch of doubt or despair to&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
HREE months had passed, and General Almonte's&#xD;
mission had failed. The reply that came from the&#xD;
Emperor Napoleon was, if anything, insulting in its&#xD;
refusal to even consider the propositions of the Mexi-&#xD;
can Commissioner.&#xD;
The whole Court at Mexico was roused to indignation; for&#xD;
they felt that the Emperor of France was about to sacrifice&#xD;
not only a noble Prince, but their country itself, by giving it&#xD;
again to the old rule of disorder and strife.&#xD;
Maximilian, always inclined to view the actions and motives&#xD;
of. others through the medium of charity, could not longer&#xD;
deceive himself. Napoleon had played him false ! And now&#xD;
at the very weakest period, when he knew that it was to be a&#xD;
death-struggle with the Empire, he made. fihe extraordinary&#xD;
demand, that half the custom-house duties should be placed&#xD;
at the command' of France ! This was taking even the -straw&#xD;
from the drowning man.&#xD;
SFor weeks and months Maimilian had given his whole time&#xD;
to organizing, and'asssigning to duty, the different -army-corps ;&#xD;

&#xD;
had been trying to recruit from the Mexicans, to take the place&#xD;
of those who were to leave; but though succeeding tolerably well&#xD;
in this, Maximilian could not hide from himself the fact, that&#xD;
he would be in a desperate condition, in regard to the means&#xD;
for supporting his army, for months to come.&#xD;
He had been closeted all the long July morning in his Cab-&#xD;
inet, at Chepultepec, with Marshal Bazaine and his Ministers,&#xD;
trying to come to some agreement concerning the division of&#xD;
these custom-house duties, which"would not leave the Mexican&#xD;
Treasury entirely empty. It had already been drained for&#xD;
France; and now, if this new demand was met, Mexico was&#xD;
bereft of her last resource. .&#xD;
Hour after hour passed in useless discussion with the min-&#xD;
isters. Marshal Bazaine could only act in accordance with the&#xD;
reply given to Genenal Almonte, that "Mexico must not rely&#xD;
further upon France, and must accept the terms proposed by&#xD;
her, i  regard to the further payment of her claims or the&#xD;
French troops should be immediately withdrawn." '&#xD;
Maximilian grew sick, contemplating, the future. He felt&#xD;
rising in his heart that despair that at times takes hold of the&#xD;
strongest and the bravest ; that makes them cry out with bit-&#xD;
terness, as David of old did, "I shall one day perish by the hand&#xD;
of Saul;" and brings up an impulse to flee away--if possible,&#xD;
to rid themselves of the cares that are wearing out the heart, in&#xD;
the service of others. Unable longer to keep back these bitter&#xD;
waters that were flowing through his soul, he at 'last exclaimed,&#xD;
pushing the papers away, -" Let us have an end of this ! I&#xD;
have been miserably betrayed! There was a formal convention&#xD;
entered into between the -Emperor Napoleon and myself, in&#xD;
which he guaranteed, absolutely, the assistance' of the French&#xD;
troops until the end of the year 1868. This was not included&#xD;
in the Treaty of Miramar; but it is, nevertheless, binding upon&#xD;
Louis Napoleon, for without it, I distinctly stated to him be-&#xD;
fore leaving Europe, that I would never accept the Mexican&#xD;
throne. . We can all see what is to be the result of this. We&#xD;
know that to attempt.to struggle on, without the bare means of&#xD;
subsistence, we shall soon be reduced to the most dreadful&#xD;
necessities. As great a blow as it will be to my pride, to say&#xD;
what course I intend to pursue, I think I understand what&#xD;
justice to my people calls me to do.. I have no right to entail&#xD;
suffering upon them, whatever I may be compelled to bear.&#xD;
My conscience tells me to give back to Mexico, the power she&#xD;
placed in my hands! Nay, if it'is the national will, the Em-&#xD;
&#xD;
press Carlotta and myself can go back to the home over the&#xD;
waters ; and Mexico may not say that it was Maximilian that&#xD;
plunged her in a sea of trouble! Call it abdication -- what&#xD;
you may, gentlemen ; I desire, before we leave this apartment,&#xD;
to resign the position which I hold, as the chief ruler of Mex-&#xD;
icc.Your Majesty," exclaimed the Secretary, "is not surely&#xD;
in earnest ?"&#xD;
"Deeply so," said the Emperor, without turning to look at&#xD;
the Ministers, who kept silence, but motioning to the Secretary&#xD;
to follow his dictation.&#xD;
It was a terribly distressing and emba-assing moment to the&#xD;
Ministers, as they heard the young Emperor wording the death-&#xD;
warrant of the Empire they had sworn to support ; and yet&#xD;
they could not stay him, for all were in despair. They felt, as&#xD;
he did, that it was to be a terrible struggle, - full of suffering&#xD;
and anxiety, and would end in defeat at last. But yet they&#xD;
could not listen to the solemn voice of the Emperor, as he con-&#xD;
tinued his dictation, without feeling their hearts pulsating&#xD;
sadly within, and a tear-drop rise to the eye, as they remem-&#xD;
bered, that when the Empire passed away, he, too, who by his&#xD;
nobility and generosity had grown; into their hearts, would go&#xD;
from their midst.&#xD;
At last, Maximilian finished ; and drawing the paper toward&#xD;
him, said to his Secretary, in the same hard, calm voice, that&#xD;
was strangely unnatural, -&#xD;
" Have the goodness to say to the Empress Carlotta, that&#xD;
her presence is desired."&#xD;
As the Secretary left the room, M. Lacunza rose, and con-&#xD;
ing n ar the Emperor, offered his hand.&#xD;
" Your Majesty ! " he exclaimed, "this is a day of sorrow and&#xD;
of pain, to all of us. We cannot with calmness entertain the&#xD;
thought that you will leave us.; and we insist that before this,&#xD;
document is made official - that before this step so fatal, to&#xD;
Mexico, and so important to yourself is taken, that your Ma-&#xD;
jesty will reflect further. The evils which afflict us now are&#xD;
great, but we trust that light will break upon us soon. With&#xD;
your Majesty to lead us, and a God overhead to protect the&#xD;
Right, we believe that this darkness shall pass away, and the&#xD;
Empire will yet prosper !"&#xD;
" God grant it !" echoed every voice in the room. "God grant&#xD;
it! " said Marshal Bazaine, coming forward; -and following M.&#xD;
Lacunza's example, taking his stand beside the 1hmperor.&#xD;

&#xD;
The door swung back upon its huge fastenings, and the&#xD;
Empress Carlotta entered.&#xD;
Those that remembered to have seen her upon the day when,&#xD;
at Miramar, she accepted, with the Archduke, the crown of&#xD;
Mexico, would say as they looked upon her this morning, that&#xD;
Time had forgotten her. There was the same lofty bearing as&#xD;
she greeted the Ministers ; -the same queenly air, and womanly-&#xD;
dignity ; -the same beauty of person; heightened by the rich&#xD;
dress she wore.&#xD;
The Empress knew that it was a subject of vital importance&#xD;
that had engaged that little assembly so long; and as she stood&#xD;
by the Emperor's side, near the table, she looked -anxiously&#xD;
into the face ofeach, to discover, if possible, whether things&#xD;
were growing brighter ; - whether there was any rift in the&#xD;
cloud that had, of late, hung like a pall over the court and&#xD;
ministry.&#xD;
Since General Almonte's return, there had been sleepless&#xD;
nights, not alone with the Emperor ; the midnight hours had&#xD;
found the Empress at his side in this little cabinet, running over&#xD;
with him, the reports of various departments; counseling with&#xD;
him, and proposing plans for the future. With her, pride and&#xD;
hope held out triumphant. Never once did she even whisper&#xD;
to herself, that they should fail. Carlotta had proved herself, in&#xD;
these dark 'hours of despair, worthy of her position; a true&#xD;
woman, and a devoted wife. She had proved her right to be&#xD;
esteemed in these. state meetings, by her wise suggestions and&#xD;
energetic disposition; and knowing so well her sanguine tem-&#xD;
perament, and indomitable perseverance, each one of the min-&#xD;
isters dreaded to face her, with what was before them this&#xD;
morning.-&#xD;
For some moments after her entrance, there was silence&#xD;
which was at last broken, by the Emperor himself.&#xD;
"Your Majesty," said he, taking up the article of abdica-&#xD;
tion, which lay on the table unnoticed by the Empress, " we&#xD;
desire to present to you this document for your consideration."&#xD;
The Empress took the paper, and opening it, ran her eye&#xD;
down the page,' taking in its contents; and, as she gradually&#xD;
understood the meaning, her face flushed, and her eyes lit up&#xD;
with the fire of unnatural excitement. Scarcely glancing at&#xD;
the Emperor who stood by her side, she turned to the ministers&#xD;
seated opposite, and in a voice strong with pride and defiance,&#xD;
exclaimed,-&#xD;
" Who has dared to .lay this before the Emperor of Mex-&#xD;
&#xD;
ico ? Does the Emperor of France pile Ossa on Pelion?&#xD;
Does this come from. him?  Abdicate!" continued the Em-&#xD;
press, seizing the document that contained the sentiment, with&#xD;
a kind of hatred, and with a triumphant smile, tearing it into&#xD;
strips, and dashing them from her to the.floor.- "Abdicate!&#xD;
that is the answer," pointing to the scattered fragments, " that&#xD;
the Emperor and Empress of Mexico give ! When those shreds&#xD;
are united again, then may the thought find entrance in the&#xD;
heart of either. No, gentlemen," continued Carlotta, her face&#xD;
still glowing from the vehemence of feeling, "we have not come&#xD;
to quite so bad a pass as yet. General Almonte has failed to&#xD;
bring to the Emperor Napoleon the consciousness of. his treach-&#xD;
ery --but I will go to France. I will go to Paris, and he&#xD;
cannot, he shall not, he dare not refuse to me, to keep his faith&#xD;
with Mexico! "&#xD;
The Empress Carlotta seemed in her earnestness, almost trans-&#xD;
figured. Every feature of her face betrayed the deep workings&#xD;
of her soul. 'Her eyes flashed with defiance ; determination&#xD;
sat upon her brow ; scorn and contempt of wrong gave a haughty&#xD;
curl to her lips. Those who knew her as the queen of the&#xD;
drawing-room, would scarcely recognize her as the Spartan hero-&#xD;
ine she looked this moment.&#xD;
Her last words, uttered with such desperation, roused every&#xD;
heart that heard them.&#xD;
M. Lacunza and the Emperor started forward.&#xD;
" You --a woman, go to France ? " exclaimed Maximilian,&#xD;
forgetting that there were others beside themselves in the&#xD;
room; and then, remembering, " Your Majesty," he continued,&#xD;
"it would be useless to waste one moment in the attempt to&#xD;
recall the Emperor of France to the obligation that he chooses&#xD;
to forget. .Let. us do even an- enemy justice,. That paper was&#xD;
written at our own dictation. Perhaps theta consideration you&#xD;
saw fit to give it, is the best- that it deserves."&#xD;
" Ah ! " said the Empress, softening as she found that the&#xD;
writing had not been offered to the Emperor for his 'signature,&#xD;
"perhaps I was too hasty ; for moments of despair are ex-&#xD;
cusable, since they nerve us in the end, with desperation to&#xD;
meet necessities. Though a woman's voice has no right to be&#xD;
heard in these storms, yet, to-day, I must say, as I look into&#xD;
your anxious faces, take courage ! I -as Empress of Mexico,&#xD;
will go to France, to the Emperor Napoleon; and if I come&#xD;
not back bearing the olive branch as token of success, be as&#xD;
sured that it is beyond mortal power to secure it:.!"&#xD;

The Empress unable to control the tears that were rising as a&#xD;
sequence to th  unusual emotion that had stirred her heart,&#xD;
left the apartme t.&#xD;
For an hour r more the ministers remained together with&#xD;
the Emperor, discussing the proposition, or rather declaration,&#xD;
made by the Empress Carlotta. There was but one that gave&#xD;
his - voice in its favor, and that was Marshal Bazaine. He&#xD;
desired that nothing that. could save both the Empire ,and&#xD;
France, should be left untried.&#xD;
At last, without any definite decision, they all left, and the&#xD;
Emperor was again alone. The rays of the afternoon sun were&#xD;
slanting through the, windows of the little cabinet-chamber,&#xD;
where Maximilian yet lingered. He felt that the time had&#xD;
come to " be still, and commune with his own heart."  His&#xD;
soul demanded solitude. He felt that perhaps he - his future,&#xD;
his past, was being weighed in the scales, and he dreaded each&#xD;
moment to see chronicled in burning letters before his mind's&#xD;
eye, the fatal " Mene, mene ; tekel, upharsin."&#xD;
Despair, to-day, with lion-like grasp, had laid hold of him;&#xD;
and though he grappled with the dark spirit with all the&#xD;
strength that he could command, it was like Sinbad and the&#xD;
old nian of the sea, "it held him so fast he could not get loose."&#xD;
Hours passed ; and still Maximilian trod the apartment&#xD;
alone. At last, as he stood beside the window and looked out&#xD;
upon the garden that surrounds the Castle, he noted that the&#xD;
long dark shadows of. the poplar-trees had crept away to rest;&#xD;
that the golden sunbeams had stolen from the jessamines, the&#xD;
roses, and the murmuring fountains, and were lingering on&#xD;
the distant hill-tops, ere they said adieu. And as he stood&#xD;
there, watching the last one depart, he suddenly called to mind&#xD;
that it was the seventh of July, -the anniversary of his&#xD;
birth.&#xD;
Thirty-four years ago, he had first seen the light of day in&#xD;
his German home. How quickly they had passed ;- those&#xD;
days of childish glee, and youthful dreams !&#xD;
As Maximilian stood watching the twilight, hanging its&#xD;
misty veil tenderly, and carefully about the beautiful earth; as&#xD;
the last flush died away from the face of the day, he gave him-&#xD;
self up to the guidance of that mysterious power that holds in&#xD;
charge the treasury of the past.&#xD;
Again he was a child upon the lawn at Sch~inbrunn; a care-.&#xD;
less, happy chiild, standing, as it were, upon the threshold of&#xD;
life. Again his heart thrilled with the manly pride that had&#xD;
&#xD;
CR0 W2N JEWELS.                  300&#xD;
filled his boyish soul, when he wore, for the first time, -the&#xD;
uniform of an Austrian midshipman; and a touch of the old,&#xD;
joyous freedom, that came to him with the breeze that had kissed&#xD;
old Ocean's brow, for a moment stole through Memory's open&#xD;
door, and then' vanished, to give place to the dreams and real-&#xD;
ities of later years. One by one, they all came and went ; the&#xD;
blissful love times at Brussels,-in haly,-and- at Niramar.&#xD;
And then-the whispers of Ambition; the hope of living for a&#xD;
people's good - of leaving behind a name that Time could not&#xD;
rob of its glory. Alas, alas ! He asked himself to-night, as he&#xD;
stood there, a man burdened with care, -a heart trembling&#xD;
between despair and desperation, "Was this the reward that&#xD;
he had reaped for those hours of study and labor? A crown&#xD;
upon his head, and its brightest jewels falling away ! A throne&#xD;
crumbling by the treachery of another !&#xD;
"Did the fault rest with him?  Had he been lacking in .&#xD;
faithfulness to his trust ? God being his witness, he had never&#xD;
given back from his duty since he had been in Mexico! Come-&#xD;
weal or woe, success.or defeat, all must say that he had striven&#xD;
to uphold the principles of right and justice."&#xD;
But enough of this. To-night, he was heartsick, and soul-&#xD;
weary. He felt that he was going through the test-period of&#xD;
his life. It was the old point that he decided once before,&#xD;
with a new bearing, that had come again--"to be, or not to&#xD;
be."  Should he remain here, and struggle through years, with&#xD;
scarcely a hope of success,_ or should he say, " I have been&#xD;
deceived," and go back to.Europe?_-&#xD;
"Go back to Europe !  Could he go there and hear the ver-&#xD;
dict of the world, "Prince Maximilian undertook more than&#xD;
he could accomplish; his ambition exceeded his ability'? "&#xD;
How bitter they sounded! those words that seemed to ring&#xD;
backward as it were, to him from futurity. No, no ! better the&#xD;
death-blow, -- better the altar, with himself the sacrificial of-&#xD;
fering, than a breath of doubtful credit on a shield he struggled&#xD;
to keep bright.&#xD;
But then, temptation softly whispered those magic words -&#xD;
Carlotta and Miramar!"  Would they not be enough to&#xD;
make him happy without the world? Did he have a right&#xD;
to keep the one who had given him herself in charge, where&#xD;
her destinyr would be obscured by clouds of sorrow ? She.&#xD;
could not be kept aloof,* for her own spirit would e induce her&#xD;
to share his fate.~ Here was anxiety and care, suffering and&#xD;
distress, to wear away the youth from their hearts; andt there&#xD;

was )fihramar / He saw it now as it loomed up in all its beauty&#xD;
and loveliness. The golden-tipped turrets bearing aloft the flag,&#xD;
under the peaceful waving of which he had dwelt so long in.&#xD;
happiness; and in front, the waters of the Adriatic, dancing in&#xD;
the sunlight ! Could he not take Carlotta again to that haven&#xD;
of rest, and let the world go ?&#xD;
"Yes! " cried the Emperor, with desperation. "Vain pomp&#xD;
and glory of this world, I hate you ! Miramar -thou art still&#xD;
true ! thou wilt welcome the wanderer again to thy heart ! "&#xD;
The door was softly opened.&#xD;
"Maximilian, are you alone, and in darkness ? " It was&#xD;
the voice of the Empress that awakened him from his dreams.&#xD;
"Yes, Carlotta," exclaimed he, turning towards her, as she&#xD;
entered. "Alone, and darkness without and within ! "&#xD;
"Do you remember, my husband," said Carlotta, softly,&#xD;
coming to his side and taking his hand in hers, as she noticed&#xD;
[the sadness in his tones, "do you remember that this is your&#xD;
anniversary ? And the whole day has gone, and I have not&#xD;
found a moment before when I could offer my congratula-&#xD;
tions !"&#xD;
"Congratulations, Carlotta?" replied the Emperor, with a&#xD;
bitter laugh. " Is it, then, a matter of gratulation with one in&#xD;
this wide world, that I was born?  Ten years ago, -nay, five&#xD;
years back, when my hopes beat high, and my heart was buoyant&#xD;
with life, within myself I cried out, ' Thank God that He gave me&#xD;
being !' but to-night, - when all is gloom and disappointment&#xD;
- when my best actions are thwarted, my best plans turned&#xD;
to naught, with those whom I esteemed full of honor, miserably&#xD;
failing; bankrupt in human trust, almost bankrupt in hope, -&#xD;
Carlotta, do you wonder, that my heart echoes the Scriptural&#xD;
sentiment, "Better is the day of a man's death, than that of&#xD;
his birth "?&#xD;
"Maximilian!" cried Carlotta, looking up to his face,&#xD;
where is the strength, the faith, the courage that has inspired&#xD;
you heretofore, amid all difficulties ? This is an hour of dark-&#xD;
ness, but we must drive it away. Shall we be found weak,&#xD;
because others are so ? Shall the world laugh that the Mexi-&#xD;
can Empire fell before the mandate of others ?  No, no ! whis-&#xD;
per as I have done, since first I knew you, my husband, " thank&#xD;
God for your birth! Life -life, Maximilian; there is strength&#xD;
in the word! " You still live, and the Empire lives. These&#xD;
troubles that beset us now, will soon be past. Let me but see.&#xD;
&#xD;
the Emperor of France, and I pledge myself that all shall go&#xD;
well with us again."&#xD;
The moonlight fell full upon the beautiful face of the young&#xD;
Empress, and as Maximilian turned, and .looked upon her, he&#xD;
drew her, by a sudden impulse, close to his heart. "Carlotta,&#xD;
my wife," he exclaimed, "I cannot give you up ! I cannot&#xD;
let you go from me ! You have ever been my right hand, and&#xD;
my heart clings to you now ; but yet, if I could but feel that&#xD;
you were safe, that you were going to Miramar, I could bear&#xD;
to say adieu, feeling even as I do, that it will be forever !&#xD;
But to know that you go to France -to know that the Em-&#xD;
press of Mexico, nay - that even the wife of Prince Maximilian&#xD;
should stand before Louis Napoleon- to supplicate, as he will&#xD;
term it ! "&#xD;
"Supplicate ?" cried the Empress. "Nay! he will not so&#xD;
mistake; to demand of him the obligations he owes to Mexico!&#xD;
Maximilian, I must go; I cannot rest here. Napoleon, we&#xD;
know, is a man of policy ; but then he is but a man, with a&#xD;
human heart. I cannot believe that he fully understands how&#xD;
much depends here upon the French assistance. Maximilian,"&#xD;
she added, earnestly, "you give your consent that I go -that&#xD;
I start at once? "&#xD;
" Carlotta -my wife," said the Emperor again, tenderly, "it&#xD;
is a long voyage, and -"&#xD;
"All contingencies and inconveniences are with me," inter-&#xD;
rupted the young Empress, earnestly. General Castillo, Count&#xD;
de Bombells, Madame Del Barrio, and others can accompany me.&#xD;
Maximilian, I claim your permission, not as your wife -not as&#xD;
Carlotta - but as the Empress of Mexico, to sacrifice personal&#xD;
feelings for the good of her kingdom and her people ! "&#xD;
"Empress of Mexico ! " exclaimed Maximilian, as if inspired&#xD;
with sudden determination, "you are right ! As husband and&#xD;
wife we may not be torn apart, but as the Emperor and. Em-&#xD;
press of Mexico we each have a work to perform. Yes!I.&#xD;
Empress of Mexico, may God bless your mission! May He&#xD;
keep you safely; and may He permit the Emperor of Mexico;&#xD;
to survive or perish with his Empire!"&#xD;
The Empress had knelt at his feet as his words of blessing&#xD;
came; and now, as he drew her up again to his side, and her eyes&#xD;
sought his, theywere filled with tears.&#xD;
"Carlotta!" exclaimed the young husband, as he pressed her&#xD;
fervently to his heart, "let us each remember, if this should be&#xD;
our parting forever, that beyond the boundaries of this world&#xD;

there is a spirit-land, where the one that goes first shall wait&#xD;
and watch for the'other."&#xD;
" Maximilian," whispered the wife, "if it should be you,&#xD;
promise me that you will call my spirit there ;-that we shall&#xD;
not be divided long ? "&#xD;
" Carlotta, Carlotta! my heart is faltering at being even here&#xD;
without you. I am almost ready to recall the words that have&#xD;
made me desolate!"&#xD;
"Then,"said Carlotta, softly, "the Empress of Mexico must&#xD;
leave before your permission is withdrawn. Remember, the&#xD;
spirit of your wife, of Carlotta, will ever be near you!  Good.&#xD;
ni ht!"&#xD;
He pressed her again and again to his heart, while a silence&#xD;
too holy, an affection too deep for words stole between them.&#xD;
Carlotta raised his hand. to her lips; a moment more, and her&#xD;
white dress fluttered through the doorway, and the husband&#xD;
and Emperor was alone.&#xD;
What was it that glistened upon his hand, as he turned tow-&#xD;
ards the moonlight?  A tear-drop ; the pearl of the Peri; and&#xD;
as the husband kissed it away, there welled up from the fountain&#xD;
within his soul, as if sent with greeting to this messenger, a&#xD;
crystal as pure, that mutely told of love, devotion, and suffering.&#xD;
The sacrifice bad been made. Yes, let her go, and bid her&#xD;
God speed ! It was enough, if she be spared the scenes of woe,&#xD;
that her woman's heart, though strong and noble, could scarcely&#xD;
stand ;for this night, with a kind of second-sight, the Emperor&#xD;
Maximilian saw -dimly it may be, into the future; saw and&#xD;
felt, that he had given up life and happiness forever. But his&#xD;
resolve was taken, - "he would never leave Mexico."&#xD;
When the moonbeams whispered to the flowers in the gar-&#xD;
den, "Twelve o'clock, and all's, well," the Emperor went out&#xD;
from his cabinet with a smile of triumph on his face. He had&#xD;
left behind in that chamber everything, save a heart that could&#xD;
unflinchingly say, -&#xD;
.     "Now, men of steel, work forth your will,&#xD;
For I can suffer and be still;&#xD;
for, comes it s1ow, or comes it fast,&#xD;
It is but death that comes at last."&#xD;
He now could look into the stern, unchanging eyes of Fate,&#xD;
with a glance of defiance that would rob her of the triumph&#xD;
of her victory!t&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIL&#xD;
&#xD;
jORE than six months had passed away since the new&#xD;
year had brought to Inez the sorrow so peculiarly&#xD;
ournful and harrowing. Giving up her position at.&#xD;
the palace, her life had been passed since at her uncle's,1in retire-&#xD;
ment and seclusion. It was lonely enough in the great, gloomy&#xD;
old house now ; with only Afita,all through the day --still&#xD;
the same loving, tender mother -yet living more than ever&#xD;
in the reahuis of the past.  In the evenig, Don Ruy would&#xD;
sit with them on the corridor overlooking the court-yard, and&#xD;
in his stately fashion discuss the 'troubles of the Empire, and&#xD;
usually throw  away his last cigar to anathematize the Em-&#xD;
peror of France and the United States. There were relief days&#xD;
to Inez now and then, from this dead-calm kind of existence,&#xD;
when the Empress would send a special request for a private&#xD;
visit, and she would go to Chepujtepec, or the national palace,&#xD;
as the case might be, and for a day or more would taste the&#xD;
pleasures of their former companionship. Only once, when&#xD;
with her, had the Empress ventured timidly upon the names&#xD;
of Giulian and Count Isolani; but the spasm of pain that&#xD;
flashed across Inez's face, and the pallor that followed, told her&#xD;
that there was some hidden sorrow that was kept sacred even&#xD;
from her; and though she felt that Count Isolani's resignation&#xD;
at the palace connected itself with Inez, and hoped thAtIhe&#xD;
future would bring all things right, she thought it best tQolet&#xD;
Time direct their destinies, without the interference of eVen;&#xD;
those who loved them best.&#xD;
From Chepultepec, filled with memories of one whom it was&#xD;
a sin to think of now, Inez always brought home t saddened&#xD;
heart. The vow that she had iade in the hour of bitter grief;&#xD;
with Giulian's dead hand in hers -that she-would devote her&#xD;
life to his memory - she believed to be recorded in heaven; and&#xD;
she believed that its keeping would affect her e ernal salvation.&#xD;
Giulian's death, coming so terribly and tragi ly, seemed a&#xD;
punishment, a judgment, for the unfaithfulnes 'of her heart ;&#xD;
and as he had died for her, ivhat sacrifice could she esteem&#xD;
too great to make for him?  Her happiness here, her prayers&#xD;
and vigils, seemed a poor, pitiful offering compared with his.&#xD;

&#xD;
And so she went on, as she trusted, straight forward in the&#xD;
path of duty. Each morning found her at an old convent near&#xD;
her uncle's, kneeling with the solemn Sisters at the gray dawn,&#xD;
and whispering her morning mass, never forgetting to plead in&#xD;
her heart for the repose of the soul of the dead-of her dead.&#xD;
Anita and herself had kept the knowledge of Giulian's mur-&#xD;
derer within their own hearts. Its disclosure could do no good,&#xD;
and they.believed that Juan's punishment for his wicked deeds&#xD;
would come sooner or later without their influence, - if not in&#xD;
this world, in the one where all must be judged, and give&#xD;
account for the sins of the body.&#xD;
As the months dragged themselves along, a change seemed to&#xD;
creep over Inez. Her proud, high nature grew subdued and&#xD;
though there was the same brilliant intellect, the same beautiful&#xD;
face, there was a softness, a gentle sadness, in her bearing, that&#xD;
told she bore a cross, and bore it unmurmuringly. She was&#xD;
trying to purify her soul, so that duty and pleasure would walk&#xD;
together. Yet, there were hours when a wicked fiend would&#xD;
whisper a name that she tried to forget ; and would tell per&#xD;
tauntingly, that her outward devotion was only a Pharisaical&#xD;
cloak; that in her heart she loved Victor Isolani-loved him as&#xD;
a woman can only love once in a lifetime ; and then, on her&#xD;
knees, in the presence of her God, she would renew her vow -&#xD;
would plead for the power to say, " Get thee behind me, Satan ! "&#xD;
And sometimes it seemed to her that the answer would come,&#xD;
softly whispered, " Daughter, be of ,good cheer ; thou shalt be&#xD;
given strength, even as thou art tempted, to overcome."&#xD;
It had been just a month since Inez had gone to the Castle&#xD;
St Chepultepec, to say "farewell" to her friend and Empress,&#xD;
on the eve, of her departure for Europe, just a month since she&#xD;
had knelt in the dim twilight in the little chapel by her Maj-&#xD;
esty's side, and whispered their last' prayer together ; just a&#xD;
month since she promised to watch and pray for the Emperor,&#xD;
while his guardian spirit was away.&#xD;
Since the Empress's departure, a new sense of loneliness had&#xD;
come over her. Another that she had leaned on, was gone; and&#xD;
she began to think that this. earth-life was only a dreary pil-&#xD;
grimage, after all, where every joy had its sister sorrow, where&#xD;
every day of feasting, its night of mourning.&#xD;
Another trial, too, had come -one that shehad prayed to be&#xD;
spared, -one that raised anew the struggle within her heart.&#xD;
Immediately upon the Empress's2 departure, the Emperor had&#xD;
recalled Count Isolani, and had appointed him an officer on his&#xD;
&#xD;
staff. He had been more than two weeks in the capital, and&#xD;
Inez had not seen him, though, had there been none to tell&#xD;
her of his arrival, the communion that one spiriteven on earth&#xD;
holds with a kindred one would 'have found a messenger by&#xD;
whom to send its greeting. A week before, Inez had been sit-&#xD;
ting in the drawing-room by the window, looking out at the shift-&#xD;
ing train that came and went, when suddenly a party of officers&#xD;
came riding by, and as they touched their hats in token of re-I&#xD;
spect, there was one who turned his face towards her.'&#xD;
It took but one glance to tell -Inez who- it was, and it took&#xD;
but one bound of her heart to tell her that it had burst the&#xD;
fetters with which she had tried to bind it. She had seen&#xD;
him -Victor Isolani-only a moment, and it was enough !&#xD;
He had given- her not even a smile.of welcome -only a long,&#xD;
earnest gaze upward to where she sat; and she felt a cruel pain&#xD;
as the thought came that, perhaps, he had forgotten his love&#xD;
for her - perhaps Time had turned it into another channel.&#xD;
It would not do ; there was her solemn vow, whose burning&#xD;
words seemed to mock her now. She could not keep- it faith-&#xD;
fully, and remain here - could not-breathe the same air, be cov-&#xD;
ered by the same circle of blue sky, and keep his image .shut out&#xD;
from her heart as she ought to do. They must leave the capi,&#xD;
tal, must go back tothe old home at Querataro, so long deserted,&#xD;
and there, perhaps, her penance-life would seem less bitter.&#xD;
Inez. found no difficulty in inducing Anita to consent to&#xD;
leave Mexico at once. Often before had she longed to return&#xD;
to the quietude of their own home, and had kept back the wish,&#xD;
because she thought Inez happier near to Giulian; but now she&#xD;
gladly seconded the proposition, that they should go at once to&#xD;
Querataro ; and notwithstanding Pon Ruy's violent opposition&#xD;
and terrible picture of his own loneliness, it was arranged that&#xD;
before another week they should leave the capital.&#xD;
It had come to the day before their departure. The morning&#xD;
had seen-Inez,.as usual, with the Sisters at mass. To them, she&#xD;
had whispered "Farewell," and the afternoon she would devote&#xD;
to the duty that seemed most sacred to her soul;- her vesper&#xD;
prayers must be said beside Giulian's grave ; her heart's last&#xD;
offering must be to him. She had not been to the little ceme-&#xD;
tery where his ashes lay, since the war had begun in.her heart-&#xD;
the spirit with the flesh; and there was a-shrinking feelihignow,&#xD;
as if she were hardly: worthy to go near the sleeping dead.&#xD;
But putting aside all voices that tempted her away, as the shad&#xD;
ows began to lengthen eastward, Inez found herself at the gate&#xD;

&#xD;
of the Panteon de Santa Maria. As she entered, and made her'&#xD;
way past the little chapel, between the graves, to the spot where&#xD;
Giulian rested, in her long mourning veil, with the folds of her&#xD;
black dress sweeping aboutoher, a basket of flowers in her hand,&#xD;
she seemed indeed a Sister of Mercy, bearing a tribute to the&#xD;
dead.&#xD;
For a long time Inez sat in silence, her basket by her side,&#xD;
and her white hands clasped about her knees. In the solitude&#xD;
that hung about the sacred spot, her mind ran back over the&#xD;
days of her life that were past, and those that were to come -&#xD;
so dreary, so lonely, so desolate ! If Giulian had lived, perhaps&#xD;
she might have been happy with him, but he was taken away ;&#xD;
and instead of content, she was left only the cold companion.&#xD;
ship of duty. Ah! what a mockery to her seemed life at that&#xD;
moment; and how she wearied at the thought of the long road&#xD;
that seemed to stretch out between herself and that land where&#xD;
all thing are earnest and true'? Would God take away her&#xD;
cross there, and would he give her a crown instead?  Though&#xD;
she had, been tempted to stray-perhaps from the 'right; though&#xD;
at this moment she felt that it was hard that she should live in&#xD;
the same world with the one who could give her happiness, and&#xD;
never hear his voice,-she was willing to make the sacrifice;&#xD;
willing to say, that, for the' sake of duty, and of heaven, she&#xD;
would never look into his face again, and would try and forget&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Inez-leaned forward, and took up the wreaths that she had&#xD;
last placed on the grave. They were withered and dead, and&#xD;
fell in crisped pieces from her hand.&#xD;
"So it is," she murmured, as she brushed them aside, and&#xD;
placed the fresh flowers she had brought in their stead; " all&#xD;
that is earthly fadeth away."&#xD;
There' was a step near her; she had not heard it before, but&#xD;
she fel now that some one stood on the other side, and was&#xD;
looking down upon "her. That indefinable mesmeric link or&#xD;
curre4 'that connects, and flows from one soul into another,&#xD;
told h e who it was, and she dared not lift her' eyes.&#xD;
"Inez" he said 'at last, in the deep tones she knew so well,&#xD;
"Inez, I am here;, have you no word of welcome ? "&#xD;
Shezaidmherhaid upon herheart to stillits tumultuous beating;&#xD;
but thewords that she would have spoken died upon her lips.&#xD;
"'Inez,"he said again, "'we have met at the right' place.&#xD;
G4iiliaf was our' brother. Look up, and say to me that I am&#xD;
welconte !&#xD;
&#xD;
" Welcome? 'Count-Isolani," she said at last, as she raised&#xD;
her eyes and they met his ; "ought I to welcome you? .Is it&#xD;
right that we should have met -'even; here?  I dare not say&#xD;
that-you are welcome '&#xD;
" No, no, Inez; it is a guardian spirit that watches over our&#xD;
happiness that has brought us together.' An impulse that I&#xD;
could not' control led me here this evening, perhaps with the&#xD;
hope that I should find you; orat least,,I feltthat you had con-&#xD;
secrated this spot by your presence. Oh ! if you only knew&#xD;
the battles I have fought and won with any :on. heart since&#xD;
the night of our parting in the garden at Chepultepec ! If you&#xD;
only knew the'hours of anguish and agony I have passed in&#xD;
the dreary camp-life, when I knew that you were to be another's&#xD;
-lost to me forever -with no ear, no heart, to which my&#xD;
grief might be confided ! How I prayed that the hand, even of&#xD;
an enemy, might do me the kind office-of Brutus' servant! 'But I&#xD;
Guilian was taken and I was left.! God knows my mourning&#xD;
over his death' was sincere!1 Never, as I am an honest man,&#xD;
until I saw your face again, did I whisper to-myself that "his&#xD;
loss might be my gain."  When the Emperor recalled me from&#xD;
General Meija more than a month since, even then my resolu-&#xD;
tion to be true to the memory of my friend 'did not falter. But&#xD;
only a week since I saw you! It was enough. I ask you now,&#xD;
Inez,' as I have asked myself each. hour of the days that are&#xD;
gone, is it wrong to grasp the prize of happiness when it seems&#xD;
so near? is it wrong that we should love 'each otherwhen noth-&#xD;
ing stands between. What is there to part us, now?"&#xD;
Inez 'was silent; and while the tears fell upon: her dress, she&#xD;
pointed simply to the-flower-wreathed grave.&#xD;
"Giulian?" cried the Count earnestly, as'1e noted the action.&#xD;
"Does not your own heart tell you he'was ohr brother?  If in&#xD;
life he had known the truth, would not  he himself have placed&#xD;
your hand in mine, and said, 'Noble soul - be happy.' And can&#xD;
we not believe that, if his'spirit sees us now, it 'says, although&#xD;
we cannot hear it,. ' Be happy'?"&#xD;
"Count Isolani," she answered, looking up intohis pleading&#xD;
face," I cannot-caarnot listento.you! I can only say to you that&#xD;
I am 'bound to Giulian Navarro as irmly now asrwhen he was&#xD;
in life. Beside his dead body, with his handdan mine, I swore&#xD;
that, as he had loved me faithfully, I would make up for all&#xD;

memory.. That vow is in God's book, and it cannot be&#xD;
broken! "&#xD;
"And am I to, give you up to the keeping of a rash vow?"&#xD;
cried the Count, seizing her hand in his, and looking almost&#xD;
fiercely int' her eyes. "Am I to go wretchedly and miserably&#xD;
alone, through life without you?  Does God spare the living&#xD;
only to mourn for the dead? We both loved Giulian Navarro,&#xD;
but he cannot still keep us from happiness. No,no, Inez; you&#xD;
must not, cannot tell me this! I claim the right of a man who&#xD;
pleads,  nay, whofghts for his life, his happiness, to say that&#xD;
no vows, ne power can keep you from me ! I love you, Inez&#xD;
Gonzales! and my claims, living, are greater than Giulian&#xD;
Navarro's, dead!"&#xD;
There was something almost desperate in his voice, and he&#xD;
would havedrawn her.towards him, but she put him back.&#xD;
Ah, In~z," he exclaimed; "this is cruel, cruel ! "&#xD;
"Count fsolani," she said, very calnly at first, but growing&#xD;
- more passionate and earnest as she went on, " you do not, you&#xD;
cannot, know all there is to keep us from each other ! You can-&#xD;
not know i ow, neither may I tell you, why it is that Guilian&#xD;
Navarro's death binds me to him more solemnly than before. -I&#xD;
cannot tell you how it was, that hi. love for me brought him&#xD;
here tohis grave ; and that with him and me, it is 'a life for a&#xD;
life;' mine belongs to him and I cannot give it to another.&#xD;
This is a mystery now," she added bitterly; "but believe me, if&#xD;
there comes a time when it is right, you shall know all; but&#xD;
trust me! By your love for me, Victor Isolani, help me to&#xD;
be strong in this trial hour! To-morrow, I go away to Quera-&#xD;
taro, my own home-; and pray God,-if it be wrong, we may&#xD;
never meet again!"&#xD;
"This is cruel, cruel ! " was all-that he could say, mournfully,&#xD;
despairingly&#xD;
" Cruel, Count Isolani? " she exclaimed earnestly, pressing&#xD;
her hands tight over her face, as if to shut out some dread thought&#xD;
or vision. "Oh! not to you alone !. Do ,you think it costs&#xD;
me nothing to" turn away from you-to give up happiness, to&#xD;
choose darkness, rather than life and joy? - Oh, trust me, trust&#xD;
me ! I dare ot look into your face, dare not stay where I may&#xD;
hear your voice! Trust me when I go away, that it is right,&#xD;
and -forget-me "!&#xD;
A haggard look of despair crept into his face as she spoke, and&#xD;
when she had finished it seemed as if a hundred winters had&#xD;
rolled over his soul. There was a great struggle within, but .&#xD;
&#xD;
the voice that spoke out was that of a man calm in the face of&#xD;
death. " Inez," he said at last, taking her hand in his, "I&#xD;
do trust you; whatever this may be that so strangely controls&#xD;
us both, I know not ; but if your heart tells you it is right, I&#xD;
accept it. We must part-I cannot say nay ; but forget you?&#xD;
Never ! till this heart forgets to beat. Do you know what it&#xD;
is to wrestle day after day with an earthly worship that you&#xD;
doubt is right, and find yourself each returning evening before&#xD;
the same shrine, worshiping still:? Do you know what it has&#xD;
cost me, to keep away from you these months past, what it- will&#xD;
cost me in these months, nay - these years to come ? And yet,&#xD;
you say we must never see each other more!"&#xD;
Never to see him more ! God help her ! There was dark-&#xD;
ness-in the thought. The years would!comie, the years would go,&#xD;
and it would be all the same ; never -never to' see him more.&#xD;
"No, Inez, it will not be so. Sometime down the future, I feel&#xD;
it here," laying his hand on his heart, "since we each have said&#xD;
adieu to happiness, -though you go away now,--sometime, I&#xD;
know not when, nor where, but when: I shall-have sore need of&#xD;
you, you will come to me; perhaps for a day perhaps for an&#xD;
hour; but you will come. That hope;-the looking'for that time,&#xD;
will lead me on, through the'dreary path that stretches before&#xD;
me now."&#xD;
"No, no, Count Isolani, you must forget- forget, and let&#xD;
happiness come to you again! Only remember, when you are in&#xD;
the world, that there is-another, brighter and more glorious than&#xD;
this, where here is no, sorrow, no parting;--- and there'isone&#xD;
who prays, in whatever'path. you; tread, that God.may' lead you,&#xD;
that you may enter His Kingdom at last.. This, (Jount Isolani,&#xD;
is all I ask you to remember. Forget the face of Inez Oonzales&#xD;
until in heaven God' says, ' Look.! "&#xD;
"And this-this" is-6ur parting ! " he whisperedas all hope&#xD;
died out of his voice. "Give me your hand again;' let me&#xD;
press you once to my heart, and' call you mine; and then-&#xD;
pity me, pity me ! My own !i though hopeless atnd despairing, ii&#xD;
thank God that I have known you; that I have loved you, for I&#xD;
have felt, through your influence, my soul has ,grown more&#xD;
tender. This love for you has made it greater, and the suffer-&#xD;
ing now. will take away the dross.  I shall keep the love still&#xD;
there, for it will show me the heavenward path.. It is a bitter&#xD;
thing, Inez, to press down under the coffin lid all' earthly joy;&#xD;

Celestial City."  An instant his voice faltered, and he heard a&#xD;
low, suppressed sob.&#xD;
"Inez," he whispered, tenderly lifting her head, and looking&#xD;
into her face, "when you are gone away from me, pray God that-&#xD;
He may send his Death-angel soon; -pray that He will not let&#xD;
us drag out many weary years apart."&#xD;
He pressed her tenderly to his heart. The sun had sunk to&#xD;
its western grave, and the moment of parting had come.&#xD;
"Give ne, before you go, Inez, your blessing," said Count&#xD;
Isolani at last, as she drew away from him. " Let ne* kneel&#xD;
here before you lay; your hand on my head, and say to me, ' Vic-&#xD;
tor Isolani, may God bless and keep you!-'"'&#xD;
He knelt before her, and her soft hand rested upon the dark&#xD;
waves of brown hair. Slowly and solemnly, in a voice half&#xD;
broken by' tears, the words came,- "Victor Isolani, may God's&#xD;
blessing r st upon. you; may He keep -you under the shadow&#xD;
of His wing, and give you a reward at last."  She leant over&#xD;
and whispered, ",Farewell! "&#xD;
"Farewell! "he murmured, as he still knelt before her. The&#xD;
words were so mournful and despairing; they seemed the echoes&#xD;
of a spirit lost to hope forever.&#xD;
She left him kneeling there beside the grave, and though a&#xD;
moment later le had risen up, he still lingered. The compan-&#xD;
ionship of hedead around suited him well; for now, there was&#xD;
nothing fqr him to look forward. to but the time when death&#xD;
should come to set him free. It was a holy sacrifice he had&#xD;
made to the memory of his friend. He would have gone to&#xD;
battle and given his life for Giulian. But to-day, he had done&#xD;
more. "The soldier's trial task is' not to die."  But he bore&#xD;
with him 4ow the memory of her love; and he believed that her&#xD;
image, enshrined as that of an angel pure and holy in his heart,&#xD;
would help him to purify himself of earthly dross, would make&#xD;
him more worthy of her in heaven.&#xD;
Twilight closed around the little cemetery; it was growing&#xD;
so dusky, hat Count Isolani could not see the graves about&#xD;
him. A tny star-beam glinted against the gold lace of his uni-&#xD;
form, but quickly hid its face again. He could not see the&#xD;
flowers Inz had placed upon Giulian's grave ; all, all that&#xD;
spoke to h  of her was gone, and in darkness and sorrow he&#xD;
too went a ay.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
HE Empress Carlotta had at last arrived at Paris _ IFor&#xD;
weeks past, the French capital had- been alive with&#xD;
speculations concerning the future of'the Mexican Em-&#xD;
pire, whose affairs grew of more interest each 4ay.&#xD;
The change of policy on the part of the Emperor Napoleon, as&#xD;
developed in the answer to General-Almonte, had given rise to&#xD;
two parties ; one, full of sympathy  and feeling for the noble&#xD;
young Prince and Princess, who had led them to .put too much&#xD;
trust in royal promises, declared aloud, the treachery -...for they&#xD;
could call it by no gentler name -of the French Emperor to&#xD;
be a stigma on the escutcheon of France. And on the contrary,&#xD;
there were not wanting those, who, priding themselves on their&#xD;
prescience and patriotism, cried out in praise of the "wisdom&#xD;
of their monarch in withdrawing from Mexico before she ruined&#xD;
France."  But neither party was prepared for the-startling&#xD;
news that the Empress of Mexico had actually landed at St.&#xD;
Nazaire, and in a few hours would be in Paris, to -seek herself&#xD;
an interview with the Emperor Napoleon.&#xD;
Yes, it was true! Brave, womanly spirit, she, had with he-&#xD;
roic fortitude left the side of the one w'ho was her shield and&#xD;
strength, and with only her- Minister, M. Castillo, a single&#xD;
lady of honor, her old friend Count de Bombells, and one or&#xD;
two others of her suite, had crossed the ocean, and was at last&#xD;
in the Great City of Europe.&#xD;
. It was but an hour since she had arrived t the "Grand&#xD;
Hotel." The long weary voyage was over ; -but- he anxietycon-&#xD;
cerning the accomplishment of her mission,  at had made the&#xD;
hours at'sea seem so tedious, and the days o double length, now&#xD;
increased. The hope that buoyed up her s ul, that had moved&#xD;
her to take the burden upon herself, now, s' ce she Wialmost,&#xD;
face to face with the hour and the man, seem d about t falter,&#xD;
and in the effort to keep her spirits up, to  eep her faith in&#xD;
herself unshaken, her nerves had assu - an unnatural ten-&#xD;
sion, that was telling on her mind an health.&#xD;
Without an hour's delay, imrfedi tely upon her arrival, the&#xD;
Empress had sent to demand an interview with the Emperor&#xD;

&#xD;
of Frande, who, with the royal family was at the Palace of&#xD;
St. Clou4, some distance from the city ; and she now, in her&#xD;
apartmet, awaited the answer.&#xD;
Your Majesty needs rest more than anything," said Ma-&#xD;
dame deli Barrio, her lady of honor, who sat watching her with&#xD;
anxiety, s she trod the length of the apartment with restless&#xD;
impatien e. "Will you not give one hour to sleep?".&#xD;
"=Rest Sleep ! Madame," said the Empress, stopping suddenly&#xD;
in front of her, and looking at her. strangely, " with such a&#xD;
turmoil ere," placing her hand upon her heart; "would you&#xD;
tell me t thrust my hand in the flames, and then say to me,&#xD;
'Sleep  hile it burns'?  Alas!" added she, as she- turned&#xD;
away an began again her walk, "rest and sleep belong to happy&#xD;
childhoo , not to men and women with cares that murder re-&#xD;
pose! ' Sleep no more ; Macbeth does murder sleep!'"&#xD;
For a moment the Empress stopped beside the window, and&#xD;
looked out upon the boulevard that ran in front of the Hotel.&#xD;
For a moment she pressed her hands together tightly upon her&#xD;
brow, an1 then again turning to Madame, she exclaimed, _&#xD;
"No, o ! I must see the Emperor of France ! They are&#xD;
waiting ver yonder to hear, and I must not delay. M. Cas-&#xD;
tillo tarries, does he not?"&#xD;
There was an unnatural gleam in the dark eyes, a wildness&#xD;
in the Enpress's manner, that Madame del Barrio could not-un-&#xD;
derstand, and, as she noted the crimson flush on her cheek, she&#xD;
again be ought her, as she valued her health, to compose her-&#xD;
self until the morrow:  Though she knew the Empress was&#xD;
of a pec liarly nervous and excitable temperament, she .had&#xD;
never seen her before so completely under the influence of emo-&#xD;
tion and impulse, as she had been during the last few days,&#xD;
and she dreaded the idea of her seeing the Emperor of France&#xD;
while in this unnatural"state of mind. But it was- useless to&#xD;
urge the Empress.' She had but one answer to every argument:&#xD;
"I must see the Emperor of France ! "&#xD;
There was a rap et the door of the adjoining salon, and the&#xD;
chamberlain announced M. Castillo.&#xD;
"So you have -come at last, M. Castillo ? " said the Empress,&#xD;
going in to meet him, and scarcely noting his salutation; " and&#xD;
what do you bring to us from his Majesty at St. Cloud?" she&#xD;
added, with a curl of the lip.&#xD;
" Your Majesty," said M. Castillo, exchanging a troubled&#xD;
glance with Madame del Barrio, "1I have but. come to beg you&#xD;
to postpone this interview --"&#xD;
&#xD;
"M. Castilo!" said the Empress impatiently, "are yu to&#xD;
dictate the course I shall pursue ?  If you are too much fa-&#xD;
tigued to accompany me, I can go alone to see the Emperor of&#xD;
France. Tell me, what is his message to us?"&#xD;
"Your pardon, my Empress," said M. Castillo, seeing that&#xD;
she could brook nothing now; "it was only my anxiety--"&#xD;
"I understand," said the Empress; "but give us this mes-&#xD;

"M. Dhrouyn de. L'Huys, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,&#xD;
~will call upon your Majesty to-morrow."&#xD;
"iM. Dhrouyn de L'Huys, the Minister !t" cried -the Em-&#xD;
press no longer able to control herself. "M. Dhrouyn de&#xD;
LHuys ! And does Louis Napoleon think to put the Empress&#xD;
of Mexico off with his Minister? Tell me, M. Castillo, all that&#xD;
Napoleon says to our demand- yes, our demand for an inter-&#xD;
view."&#xD;
"The Emperor of France," said M. Castillo, "through his&#xD;
chamberlain, begs leave to express his regret to your. Majesty,&#xD;
that indisposition will prevent his giving the desired audi-&#xD;
ence."&#xD;
"Indisposition! " exclaimed the Empress, as she turned her,&#xD;
flashing eyes full upon M. Castillo; and then, as ifto give&#xD;
vengt to her emotion, beginning hurriedly to walk the apartment.&#xD;
" Louis Napoleon offers this insult to me ! And did his Ma-&#xD;
jesty condescend to mention whether it is indisposition of mind,&#xD;
. or of body-? A flimsy veil he attempts to throw about him-&#xD;
self ! No, M. Castillo," continued the Empress, stopping near&#xD;
him, "we cannot be put off in this way. We must see this&#xD;
French Emperor to-day. Does his indisposition affect him so&#xD;
seriously that he forgets even to be courteous ? Does he send&#xD;
a court-carriage to us?"&#xD;
" The carriage is below, at your Majesty's, command," said&#xD;
M. Castillo; "but let me beseech you," he added, giving way&#xD;
again to his anxiety for the Empress, and willing to meet her&#xD;
anger, since he knew that the fever in her veins had unnerved&#xD;
her, "in the name of the Emperor Maximilian, who charged&#xD;
me that I should guard you from all evil, do not go to St.&#xD;
Cloud to-day. Your Majesty is not strong enough. You can-&#xD;
not do as much for Mexico, as if you were yourself. Rest to-&#xD;
day, my Empress, and to-morrow -to-morrow -we shall&#xD;

were unheeded. The Empress, with her hert full of indigna.&#xD;
tion, resolve, and determination, was inflexible.&#xD;
"No! M. Castillo; delay is useless. I-do not fear to meet&#xD;
Napoleon. I am strong enough, since I have Right on my side.&#xD;
I shall not mock his ear with empty courtesies or compliments.&#xD;
The daughter of the House of Orleans does not come to sue&#xD;
for favors from this Bonaparte-but to demand justice! I will&#xD;
joill you below, M. Castillo, in a few moments, andweilgo&#xD;
at once to St. Cloud."&#xD;
M. Castillo left the salon, and a half-hour, later he handed&#xD;
the Empress (attired in simple travelling costume, with nought&#xD;
to proclun her rank) into the carriage, and taking his place&#xD;
beside her, they were soon rolling through the streets of Paris,&#xD;
in the direction of the Palace so famous in history.&#xD;
St. Cloud! name inseparably connected with the House of&#xD;
Bonaparte ! It was there that the great hero, with the iron&#xD;
will and determination of a Cromwell, dissolved the Convention&#xD;
of Five Hundred, turned out the members, and made-fast the&#xD;
door. Versailles, sacred to the memory of the hapless pair&#xD;
whose devotion to their subjects was rewarded after the manner&#xD;
of French gratitude -Versailles'! with its fountains and groves,&#xD;
stands, only as the Mecca of appreciative travellers, who love&#xD;
the name of Marie Antoinette. But St. Cloud -that tells of&#xD;
triumph to the House of Bonaparte, is still the scene of dis.-&#xD;
play, of pomp and splendor, as a summer palace, with Napoleon&#xD;
III.&#xD;
As the carriage, bearing the Empress of Mexico and her&#xD;
minister, rolled through the beautiful garden that surrounds&#xD;
thepalace, the grounds were filled with visitors, who, wandering&#xD;
here and there, stopping beside the double cascade, whose wa-&#xD;
ters kept up their ceaseless flow, at last, for. a moment, forgot to&#xD;
wonder and admire, as they watched the court-carriage, that&#xD;
was now drawing up in front of the palace.&#xD;
With obsequious courtesy, the Empress Carlotta and M.&#xD;
Castillo were shone into the grand reception-room; the former&#xD;
simply announcing herself as " the Empress of Mexico, who&#xD;
desired ah ininediate audience with the Emperor Napoleon."&#xD;
"His    ajesty the Emperor will have the honor of seeing&#xD;
the Empress of Mexico in his private cabinet," was the answer&#xD;
which thechamberlain returned, a few moments later ;a~nd,&#xD;
breeding; them, he led the way from the reception room to&#xD;
the cabinIt, where Napoleon awaited them.&#xD;
"he Empress Carlotta is welcome to France" said the Em-.&#xD;
&#xD;
peror rising, and cowing forward with extended hand, as the&#xD;
Empress and M. Castillo were announced. With an inflation&#xD;
towards the Minister, he again resumed his seat. "We trust,&#xD;
your Majesty, that the Archd uke - the Emperor Maxiiiiian&#xD;
- enjoys the blessing of health ?"&#xD;
"It is to bear the thanks of the Emperor Maxnnlian&#xD;
said the Empress, who had seated herself upon a handsome di-&#xD;
van that stood near, and who only-noticed the Edperor's un-&#xD;
fortunate blunder over her husband's title, by assummng a kau-&#xD;
tewr foreign to her native affability, "to bear his thanks to&#xD;
your Majesty for your good wishes, that I fid myself in&#xD;
France. We regret that our stay in Paris is. so limited that&#xD;
we could not put aside the necessity of an audience until your&#xD;
Majesty had quite recovered from indisposition."  A slight&#xD;
smile curled the Emperor's lip, as he noted the sarcasm lurking&#xD;
in Carlotta's words, but he went on toying with the pearl paper-&#xD;
cutter, that lay on the table beside him. "The Emperor Maxi-&#xD;
milian has been sorely puzzled- of late," continued the Em-&#xD;
press, "to determine whether the expressions of good-will to&#xD;
himself, had not missed their way from the Cabinet of the&#xD;
United States, and from mere force of habit found themselves&#xD;
in Mexico."&#xD;
"Indeed ? "'said the Emperor, perfectly imperturbable and&#xD;
unmoved. " No ; the Emperor may-feel satisfied. M. Dhrouyn&#xD;
de L'Huys, takes care of our friendship with the United,&#xD;
States.&#xD;
Piqued at the indifference of Napoleon, and finding that her&#xD;
arrows glanced, without the least impression, from the coat&#xD;
of mail in which he seemed morally clad, Carlotta impulsively&#xD;
exclaimed,-&#xD;
"But the time has come, your Majesty, when words alone&#xD;
cannot be taken as the true test of feeling and intention;&#xD;
when something more than empty compliments are necessary;&#xD;
and as your Majesty's actions towards the Mexican Empire re-&#xD;
cently have been of doubtful bearing, the Emperor Maxirmbian&#xD;
is free to confess the anxiety he feels -concerning"the treaties&#xD;
with France, upon which he has hitherto relied with so much&#xD;
faith."&#xD;
" Madame," said the Emperor, as she paused a moment for&#xD;
reply, "the Emperor Maximilian has grown- no more uneasy&#xD;
or, anxious upon this subject; than we ourselves. We scarcely&#xD;
think Mexico can complain of France, in regard to failure of&#xD;

treaties and promises, when she remembers her own extr me&#xD;

,Mexico," said the Empress, her eyes catching fire, " points&#xD;
to the second article of. the Treaty of Miramar, which guaran-&#xD;
tees that the troops furnished by France should'not be with..&#xD;
drawn, until the Emperor of Mexico should be able to organ-&#xD;
ize others to take their place. It is to ask the keeping of this&#xD;
-stipulation, which is now of vital importance to Mexico, that&#xD;
I have come to France, and to your Majesty. I demand no&#xD;
more than justice, when I insist that France should adhere to&#xD;
the original articles of agreement."&#xD;
"Madame," said the Emperor, quite unmoved, "if we go to&#xD;
this Treaty of Miramar, we must take it as a whole: Mexico&#xD;
must not ignore her promise therein, concerning the indemni-&#xD;
fication of France; The Emperor Maximilian, in complaining&#xD;
of us, and of failure on our part, seems to forget that France&#xD;
has but incompletely received the compensation due her, for&#xD;
the great assistance and aid she has lent to the Mexican Em-&#xD;
pire.&#xD;
And what is the amount of the present indebtedness of&#xD;
Mexico to France ?" replied the Empress, an expression of.&#xD;
contempt stealing over her face. " Four hundred thousand&#xD;
francs ! What was it when the Empire was established ?&#xD;
Twelve millions ! Mexico has then, done at least something&#xD;
towards securing France. The Emperor Maximilian forget,&#xD;
French claims !" continued Carlotta, rising, as her 'feelings&#xD;
seemed to grow intense and bitter with, her words. "Not&#xD;
while the Emperor of France lives to remind him of them,&#xD;
and to thrust them upon him, and fling them in his face upon&#xD;
occasions seemly and unseemly ! I tell you, Emperor Napo-&#xD;
leon," stopping before him, and bending her large dark eyes,&#xD;
full of fire and spirit, earnestly upon him, "if the Emperor&#xD;
Maximilian could turn every drop of blood in his veins,-&#xD;
yea, if the Empress of Mexico, who stands before you to-day,&#xD;
couldchange the fountain of life in her heart to golden sover-&#xD;
eigns, to cast into the treasury of France, then would these&#xD;
clamorings cease! We should hear no more of French claims,&#xD;
and Church claims, which, with indecent haste, were urged for-&#xD;
payment upon the Emperor Maximilian, before his foot pressed&#xD;
the soil of his Empire. Give me some Midas power, and, even&#xD;
at the price' of my own life, France shall be- satisfied, though&#xD;
Mexico be ruined !" -The Empress was growing strangely ex-&#xD;
citegI. There was a wild abasndon in her manner, a desperate&#xD;
&#xD;
despair in her words, that startled M. Castillo. Something, he&#xD;
could see, was nerving the'Empress for the moment, and he&#xD;
dreaded a reaction, that might prostrate her, mentally and physi-&#xD;
cally. Forgetting almost the presence of Napoleon, he half-&#xD;
way started forward to the Empress.&#xD;
" Your Majesty," --he began, as if to intercede with her&#xD;
for herself; but, with a motion of the hand, Carlotta waved&#xD;
him to be seated again; -and then, placed her hand upon her&#xD;
heart as if to still its beatings, which were growing painfully&#xD;
tumultuous.&#xD;
"Your. Majesty," said the Emperor Napoleon, endeavoring&#xD;
in vain to conceal the momentary admiration he felt for the&#xD;
noble sentiment of the woman who stood so proudly before&#xD;
him, "you are hardly the proper person with whom to discuss&#xD;
these perplexing and intricate questions."  His tones were full&#xD;
of respectful courtesy and feeling. " Your Majesty is worn&#xD;
out with a long voyage," he added, " and such unusual excite-&#xD;
ment is not well for your health. Let me beg that you leave&#xD;
these matters to be arranged between M. Castillo and my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"The Empress of Mexico is indebted for the consideration&#xD;
expressed for her health ; but she is the best judge of her course,&#xD;
of action, and the consequences are with her. No, your Maj-&#xD;
esty," she added, " I have come to France as the Ambassador,-&#xD;
truly extraordincire-of the Empire, and these points must be&#xD;
discussed and arranged with no other. Shall we proceed ?"&#xD;
"Not before I beg thatyour Majesty be seated," said the&#xD;
Emperor calmly, as he saw Carlotta was determined ; and, rising&#xD;
he offered a chair near the green - covered table. "There&#xD;
is no need, your Majesty," he continued, again, resuming his&#xD;
own seat, "to go back to the origin of the French expedition;&#xD;
and yet, perhaps, a-little introspection. and retrospection 'may&#xD;
help us to make some sound conclusions. But" said the Em-&#xD;
peror, suddenly pausing; as he looked up at the Empress, " it is&#xD;
very disagreeable to inflict these things upon your Majesty."&#xD;
" That is nothing-nothing," said the Empress carelessly, as,&#xD;
with an inclination of her person, she assumed an air of painful&#xD;
attention, and motioned the Emperor to proceed.&#xD;
" I beg your Majesty to ask yourself the. simple'question,"&#xD;
said the Emperor, 'What it was, that first induced France to&#xD;
take any actionin Mexican affairs? It was for the redress of&#xD;
grievances and offences, both personal and national. . Not the&#xD;
least of . these grievances was the immense amount -due to&#xD;

French objects, and those who claimed the, protection of the&#xD;
Imperial ag. After the first expedition to Mexico, by Eng-&#xD;
land, Sp'Sp , and France, it was quickly discerned that the&#xD;
promises president Juarez, and the Republic, were empty&#xD;
not so m''ch, perhaps, from want of -faith, but of ability to&#xD;
fulfil the9  The country was then, and has ever been, so torn&#xD;
by ranarchy and civil commotion, that its revenues were mere-&#xD;
ly=nom   , and its vast resources were. locked, as it were, in a&#xD;
sealed mirne. Moved.no less by the appeals of Mexican patriots,&#xD;
than by' a'ixiety for her own subjects, who had suffered at&#xD;
the hands of Mexico, and feeling that she- had a mortgage&#xD;
upon Me"co, and had. a right to foreclose it ; and believing,&#xD;
moreover, strongly in the regenerative element she believed&#xD;
to be in e 'stence. there,-France undertook to do, not only&#xD;
to Mexic9, but the whole world, a service, by building her&#xD;
up through  the 'influence of the Latin race. The enterprise&#xD;
was admitted to be a grand one, worthy of success. The Em-&#xD;
pire was established, and the Archduke Maximilian was called&#xD;
to the chisf rulership. Full of chivalry and .noble daring,&#xD;
generous   pulses, and elevated ideas of doing his fellow-men&#xD;
good; no1.ing daunted by the dangers and difficulties which he&#xD;
knew woul4 beset his path,- the Archduke accepted; and most.&#xD;
nobly and courageously has he, by his untiring devotion, vin-&#xD;
dicated h' manhood."&#xD;
The Eni eror paused a moment, for he saw a tear-drop fall&#xD;
upon the  hite jeweled hand that lay on the table. He looked&#xD;
up, but the dark eyes were turned away, 'and he knew that&#xD;
their bright ness was dimmed. Carlotta's mind, as she listened&#xD;
to the las words of the Emperor, had gone back over the two&#xD;
toilsome. y are they had spent in Mexico. She thought of Maxi-.&#xD;
milian, his elf-abnegation, his earnest working, days. and nights ;&#xD;
and then _4e remembered the birth-night at Chepultepec, and&#xD;
his despai ' g words rang in her ears, "Better is the day of a&#xD;
man's deat , than that of his birth!" 'Devotion! nay, call&#xD;
it immolation, and the truth was nearer.&#xD;
Carlotta brushed away the tear ; and turned again ,to the&#xD;
Emperor.&#xD;
"Madame," said he, tenderly considerate, as he looked into'&#xD;
the youngbeautifulface, bearing such traces of care and anx-&#xD;
iety, " youk husband is a noble man; and is not wanting in&#xD;
ability to complish anything, when the event rests with him-&#xD;
self alone, addepends for success solely on his exertions. The&#xD;
failure of t~eMexican Empire lies not at his door, but with&#xD;
&#xD;
the Mexican people themselves. They will not sustain any&#xD;
Government- Republic, or Empire; nor any ruler, be it. Pres&#xD;
dent or Emperor. They have never done it yet. They hare&#xD;
been fairly tested in these past four years. They-will never do&#xD;
it in the future."&#xD;
A ray of hope crept into Carlotta's,-heart, and beamed for&#xD;
an instant in her eyes, as in the Emperor's kindly words. she&#xD;
seemed to gather an unbending ofhissiron nature. . A drown-&#xD;
ing man will catch a straw, and in the. darkest hour of despair&#xD;
we eagerly cry. out to ourselves," The day cometh!" at the&#xD;
faintest glmmer of even an ignis fatuus, that may be chancing&#xD;
by us. Far in the distance, at this moment, the Empress. of&#xD;
Mexico sa'w the dark cloud that dung over the future, faintly&#xD;
lifting itself away.&#xD;
Napoleon noted the change of expression, noted the glad&#xD;
light that had stolen into her eyes, and by a breath he extin-&#xD;
guished it. The man of the world -the Emperor ---remem-&#xD;
bered his policy.&#xD;
" But, Madame," he began, turning his eyes inadvertently, as&#xD;
it were, towards the- ceiling, that he might not see the death&#xD;
agony of hope in that nbble face, ",though the Emperor Maxi-&#xD;
milian went to Mexico with the co-operation of Francepit:was&#xD;
clearly understood, that it was not simply to sustain him upon&#xD;
the throne, but to protect and indemnify herself-through 'his in-.&#xD;
strumentality, that France lent men, money, and-infiues.c6 to&#xD;
the Empi-e. We hoped to aid him in a work, which should&#xD;
be of profit, not to France alone, but to the whole world.The&#xD;
result has disappointed every tlng. 1exico;toilt notsbe lifted&#xD;

over to her idols. I repeat it: the fault has not been with.&#xD;

at logic, or has not the friendly voice of the United States had&#xD;
much to do with making these deductions ?"&#xD;
Napoleon gave no token of the irony in her words, save a&#xD;
nervous twitching of his dark moustache, and a slight contract.&#xD;
tion of the brow.&#xD;
"Madame," he said at length, "we fully comprehend the em-&#xD;
bairassing situation of the Emperor, in Mexico, --."&#xD;
" No," replied the Empress suddenly, as if again losing con.&#xD;
trol of herself, as she thought of what she had left behind in&#xD;
Mexico, and of all that was at stake in this interview. "No:&#xD;
you, here, in Paris, with your National Guard at your command,&#xD;
resting in peace, in luxury, in splendor, cannot understand it.&#xD;
You cannot understand the moral effect which the wiithdrawal&#xD;
of the French troops will have, not in the Western Continent.&#xD;
alone, but here in Europe. It is not alone the loss of this city&#xD;
and that province, which, as the French withdraw, the Juarists&#xD;
will occupy ; it is the loss of prestige to the Empire ; the ap.&#xD;
pearance of being deserted by France,. that will dispirit her&#xD;
people, destroy confidence in the stability of the Empire, and&#xD;
deal it the death-blow. The United States comes forward as&#xD;
an ally of Juarez and the Republic; and at the same moment&#xD;
France withdraws from the Empire, and says to her before the&#xD;
'whole world; 'You will never succeed. I can help  o   o&#xD;
longer ; sustain yourself if you can ! "&#xD;
"No, your Majesty," said the Emperor, firmly and slowly.&#xD;
"I do not say 'sustain the Empire;' 11 say to the Emperor Maxi-&#xD;
milian -permit me to speak plainly  'Return to Miramar and&#xD;
your rights as Archduke of. Austria.' What stands in the way&#xD;
of this ? leave Mexico to herself!"&#xD;
For a moment a pallor was on Carlotta's face, then the blood,&#xD;
already burning with fever, coursed wildly through her veins,&#xD;
and, a flush overspread her brow. Napoleon had struck a deep&#xD;
chord when he gave her pride this open blow.&#xD;
"And do you think, Emperor of France," she cried excitedly,&#xD;
rising, "that a Prince of Austria can so easily bow his head&#xD;
before the world, and take unto himself defeat and disgrace?&#xD;
No ! no! Maximilian is not like this; he will never leave Mex-&#xD;
ico, unless she herself bids him go., Let us hear France's final&#xD;
decision. Does she leave Mexico alone to struggle in asea of&#xD;
troubles ? - Does France save herself at the cost of her honor ?&#xD;
When a nation violates her pledged word, she violates her&#xD;
honor. What is France's decision ?"&#xD;
The Empress pressed the point. She leant her hand upon&#xD;
&#xD;
the table-and bent forward with intense earnestness, waiting as&#xD;
it were for a verdict, fatal to life and happiness. M. Castillo&#xD;
rose. He knew not the words she had just spoken, for his eyes&#xD;
had been watching the strange look in the face of his Empress.&#xD;
He had never seen that wild, disturbed manner, those terribly&#xD;
nervous movements, that reckless bearing, before.&#xD;
"Your Majesty," said the Emperor Napoleon, likewise rising,&#xD;
as if impatient to terminate the interview, "this is all useless!&#xD;
The Emperor Maximilian has our good wishes; and if his mind&#xD;
is firmly fixed to remain, we trust that he may be able to ac-&#xD;
complish the great work of civilization he has undertaken. We&#xD;
trust that his devotion, his energy, his patriotism,'may be 're-&#xD;
warded!&#xD;
Carlotta had not taken her eyes from the speaker ; her lips&#xD;
hardly moved, as she asked, calmly and coldly, -&#xD;
"Is this the message of France to Mexico ? "&#xD;
" This is the Emperor Napoleon to the Emperor Maximil-&#xD;
ian," said Napoleon, stolidly. " France transmitted her message.&#xD;
to Mexico through General Almonte."&#xD;
All, then, was gone ! - Hope, faith,*sand justice lay murdered,&#xD;
and the assassin stood before her  Carlotta could no longer&#xD;
control herself; the calm iess.'that had held the storm at bay&#xD;
was broken. The fever within, that she had placed her hand&#xD;
upon and held back from Reason's throne, sat there now, since&#xD;
the sentinel was gone, smiling triumphantly. Raising her hand&#xD;
with a wild gesture, in a voice full of ~strange emotion, she&#xD;
cried out to her Minister, who stood beside her,&#xD;
" M. Castillo, let us go!I . Let us leave Paris, leave France&#xD;
forever ! Yes, hated, detested France, whose soil -lapped up&#xD;
the blood of the beautiful Marie Antoinette, and who, wolf-&#xD;
like, now'scents that of another of the House - of Hapsburg!&#xD;
It shall not be ! Maximilian shall not be offered a sacrifice by&#xD;
the relative of a plebeian Corsican usurper !"&#xD;
M. Castillo seized her Majesty's hand, and tried to lead her&#xD;
towards the door; but wresting it from him, she again took&#xD;
a step towards Napoleon, who stood troubled and moved, as'-he&#xD;
discerned that the Empress Carlotta was stricken worse than&#xD;
death.&#xD;
Carlotta had drawn herself proudly up, and looking him full&#xD;
in the face she exclaimed,"-&#xD;
"Louis Napoleon, it was revolution that wrested the crown&#xD;
from the House of Orleans, and gave it to the Corsican and his&#xD;

the dust, who can still the voices of these French people, or&#xD;
their maddening cry,, 'Long live the people'? Your hand will&#xD;

I The Empress seemed as one inspired.- Napoleon lifted his&#xD;
hand as if to shut her off, but again she spoke.&#xD;
"Never again will the daughter of -Orleans be found at the&#xD;
foot of the French throne! - Come, M. Castillo, let us leave&#xD;
this place,-this atmosphere stifles  one with the smell of&#xD;
blood. Come#!"&#xD;
They were both gone, and Napoleon was left alone ! He&#xD;
threw himself in his chair beside the table, and leant his head&#xD;
upon his hand. Carlotta had left her spirit, aye, the beautiful&#xD;
spirit that' guides this life, behind' to haunt him; and she had&#xD;
gone forth in utter darkness, without hope, without reason, with.&#xD;
out light !  Her life for the future aimless, pointless, worse&#xD;
than blank !&#xD;

within himself; in vain did he whisper that he had acted for&#xD;

he called out to the spirit that brooded, bat-like therein--&#xD;
"Take thy form from off my door,&#xD;

Barrio, and her Majesty's devoted attendants echoed&#xD;
her words, when -the painful" truth forced itself upon&#xD;
them, that the Empress was terribly shaken in mind, as well as&#xD;
body. With anxious care they watched every word, every&#xD;
glance, and every movement; and, as the hours passed, though&#xD;
the glow of intellect was still in the dark eyes, they were com-&#xD;
pelled to admit that the fever was gone, and the Empress was&#xD;
not the same..&#xD;
All anxiety concerning their mission was lost in this absorb-&#xD;
ing trouble; and in their hearts they mourned that sorrow had&#xD;
put its crown of sorrow upon the beautiful lady's head.&#xD;
"Let us.go to Miramar," said 'Dr. Bowslaveck, her Majesty's&#xD;
physician, "and there pray God, that retirement and tender&#xD;
care may restore her ! "&#xD;
So they left Paris, with all its stir and bustle, all its gay-&#xD;
ety and folly, all its gilded vice and hidden sin, a troubled,&#xD;
anxious party. And all things went on the same, save that it&#xD;
was whispered through the court circles "that the Empress Oar-&#xD;
lotta had made nothing by her visit to Paris; that Mexican&#xD;
affairs were growing worse, and that it was perhaps well enough&#xD;
that her Majesty's health would not permit her to return there.&#xD;
It would be better if the Prince Maximilian were with her&#xD;
and safely across the water; for now, since France had decided&#xD;
to withdraw her forces, there could be no hope for the Em-&#xD;
pire!"&#xD;
The morning sun had risen in beauty over the stone turrets,&#xD;
over the corniced balconies, over the marble fountain in the&#xD;
quiet garden, and reaching the meridian summit, with Nar-&#xD;

&#xD;
as we look upon it again, it stands there, - the castle still the'&#xD;
same, a sentinel tower upon "a headlong rock."  Twoyears&#xD;
ago, and the Novara, with pennons flying, guns sounding, and&#xD;
shouts rending the air, had borne from the castled crag two&#xD;
hearts beating high with hope, and pulsating firmly with ambi-&#xD;
tious resolve for the future. To-day, one stricken by disappoint-&#xD;
ment, saddened by grief and wounded pride, comes back alone.&#xD;
There are the same "viva.s!" from true , hearts to welcome&#xD;
her back; there- are the vessels from Trieste, which have come&#xD;
out to meet her, bearing aloft the flags of Mexico and Austria;&#xD;
there is the same blue sky above, the sunlight -rests in' quiet&#xD;
brightness upon the distant hills, and gleams and glances over&#xD;
the wavelets of the gulf, as of yore; but to the Empress, as she&#xD;
stands upon the bow of the vessel, and waits for the mooring,&#xD;
there is no pulsation of joy, no life in all around. The spirit&#xD;
of happiness has gone from her heart and Miramar is forever&#xD;
heneforth ; haunted with sorrowful memories, that in future&#xD;
years will mock her woe with ceaseless echoes of a happy, but&#xD;
a dead past !&#xD;
" See ! see, your Majesty! "exclaimed the Count de Bombells,&#xD;
who stood by her side, "how all nature seems to smile at your&#xD;
return!  Ah! if Miramar could but find voice this moment,"&#xD;
he added, merrily, "how loudly would 'she cry out for joy!"&#xD;
Just at that moment, a dark cloud, that had, unperceived,'&#xD;
crept up the western 'horizon, shut in the face of the sun, and&#xD;
threw the beautiful landscape in front, into shadow, while the&#xD;
distant sound of heaven's artillery hushed the voice of the imi-&#xD;
tating guna of the squadron, and a sudden gust of wind, sweep-&#xD;
ing over the gulf, caught the resisting waves in a wild em-&#xD;
brace, and their frothy spray leaped up, and fell in a tiny&#xD;
shower upon the deck.&#xD;
" Ah! Count," said the Empress, not minding the mist of&#xD;
the spray, though her ladies had retired nearer. the door of the&#xD;
salon, "see how the sunlight shrinks from, and flies my pres-&#xD;
ence. No, no! I bring evil to all; I am to live in the shadow;&#xD;
and be haunted with phantom joys, through all the future ! "&#xD;
"No, no, your. Majesty," said the Count, with an effort to&#xD;
turn the drift of the Empress's thoughts, for her malady' had&#xD;
taken the more quiet form of despondency and mental depres-.&#xD;
sion in the last few days, and from this great hopes were enter-&#xD;
tained o'f rallying her, -- "no, no ; behind the cloud the sunf still&#xD;
shines. ' This is only a summer shower, and we may yet hope&#xD;
for one of our grand sunsets."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hope, hope!" replied-the Empress, with the same dejected&#xD;
air, "the Ignis Fatuussof life, that leads men into darkness and&#xD;
leaves them 'in despair."&#xD;
" Oh ! " continued the Count, without' seeming to. note her&#xD;
bitter words, "if his Majesty were only here ! If the Emperor&#xD;
Maximilian could only be with us, at the castle, through the&#xD;
long, golden days that we are to pass !"&#xD;
The Count's words had the effect he desired., At the men-&#xD;
ti n of the Emperor's - of Maximilian's name, a look of tender&#xD;
gladness stole into her eyes, and, in a tone of animated regret&#xD;
yet of manifest interest in -things present, she exclaimed,&#xD;
" Ah ! if he were only here! .When shall we go back to him,&#xD;
Count Bombells, since he cannot come to us ?"&#xD;
There was time for no more. The vessel had reached the&#xD;
shore ; and the crowds that had come out from Trieste, to greet&#xD;
her home, and who still waited along the beach in spite of&#xD;
the threatening clouds, were pressing forward to catch a glimpse&#xD;
of the young Empress's face, and were drowning all other sounds&#xD;
with their boisterous shouts, "Long life -long life- to the&#xD;
Empress Carlotta! Long life to the Emperor Maximilian-!."&#xD;
As excitement was the one thing to be avoided with the&#xD;
Empress, she did. 'not linger"'in the garden among' those who&#xD;
seemed so anxious to express their love and devotion, even by&#xD;
touching the hem of her garment ; but retired at -once to her&#xD;
rooms in the Palace.&#xD;
The crowd, satisfied that "their beautiful young Princess," as&#xD;
they still called her, was again upon the soil of Germany, were&#xD;
persuaded to return to the city, carrying with them, the united&#xD;
sentiment, " Would that our young Prince were with her, too !&#xD;
Would that they had never left Miramar ! "&#xD;
The summer days passed on. Tenderly and carefully Was&#xD;
the Empress Carlotta watched and guarded; all unfavorable&#xD;
intelligence, or anything that could possibly affect her, was kept&#xD;
back, and to the loving eyes of her ladies and her physician,&#xD;
who looked so anxiously for it; a change for the better seemed&#xD;
daily taking place. The cloud of sadness seemed to lift-itself&#xD;
from her mind.; and the mornings in her- little boudoir, with&#xD;
easel and brush, and the afternoons on the lake, or strolling&#xD;
through the garden, were hours of delight and pleasure. Car-&#xD;
lotta seemed to. have forgotten her position as Empress; she&#xD;
was again the Archduchess Carlotta, waiting the Archduke's&#xD;
return from some distant cruise. The names of Mexico, France,&#xD;

and Napoleon were never mentioned, and all remembrance of her&#xD;
last sad visit to Paris seemed to hye passed entirely away.&#xD;
But; all the hopes that were ch risked, that this, too, would&#xD;
pass away, and leave her laajesty prepared to understand&#xD;
the true state ofthings, and to ace them with the firmness&#xD;
and fearlessness that had always been a characteristic, were&#xD;
destined to be disappointed. Things went on in smooth train&#xD;
for more than a month, and it wa near the middle of Septem-&#xD;
ber.&#xD;
The Empress had risen earlier than was her usual custom,&#xD;
and had gone down alone in the garden to breathe the pure air&#xD;
of the morning. Madame del Barrio would have joined her as&#xD;
she left the Palace, but the Empress had put her back, saying:&#xD;
"No, no, Madame; I must be lone this morning!. I must&#xD;
think, must think;' we have been, eating long enough; " and&#xD;
so she went down to the little sunimer-house, with its trailing&#xD;
vines, and jasmines, and sat there alone.&#xD;
As she looked out upon the wat r, over which hung a vapory&#xD;
mist, listened to the matin song of the birds in the vines that&#xD;
clambered over the -arched doorway of the little garden temple,&#xD;
in which she rested, Carlotta seemed, indeed, to herself, to&#xD;
awaken from a dream. As the strengthening sunbeams caught&#xD;
up the misty curtain from the wa4ers, it seemed too, to shine&#xD;
into her heart and brain, so that s e might look within boldly,&#xD;
and see that the darkness was gon -.&#xD;
Like some distant landscape'seei faintly at first, yet coming&#xD;
nearer and nearer each moment, till at last, just before us, it&#xD;
lies out, and we gaze steadily and purely at objects that begin&#xD;
to lose their strangeness and gro  more familiar, and waken&#xD;
in our hearts a smile of gladness, Or a sigh of regret; as we re-&#xD;
cognize some scene of the past, ar und which hang joyous or&#xD;
sorrowful memories, - so the paMorama of the past two years&#xD;
came before the Empress's men 1 .vision. She remembered&#xD;
each.event as it had occurred; the life in Mexico, the parting&#xD;
at Chepultepec, the long, lonely sea voyage, the arrival at&#xD;
saris, and, last, the terrible, fruitless .interview with the Em-&#xD;
peror of France.                  '&#xD;
Carlotta started, as she called them: up one after another.&#xD;
Was she dreaming ? had she been in Europe,'indeed, for near.&#xD;
two months, and passed one in easb and rest here at Miramar,&#xD;
and her mission for Mexico unfulilled ?. She had failed with&#xD;
the Emperor of France, but there was the Holy Father at&#xD;
Rome ; a hope still lay with him., He could control the Church&#xD;
&#xD;
party for' the Emnpire. He, by the exercise of his .high autho-&#xD;
rity, might sustain the Emperor, and ,they might still succeed.&#xD;
She must go to Rome, go there at once, and intercede with&#xD;
Pope Pius. She, resting quiet, and Mexico relying upon her-&#xD;
waiting for her ! Not another day must be lost !&#xD;
Filled with the impulse, and reproaching herself that she&#xD;
had even let illness interfere with her duty, the Empress has-&#xD;
tened to the Palace, and as she went up to her own apartment,&#xD;
gave orders to the marshal of the household, that M. Castillo,&#xD;
Dr. Bowslaveck, and her ladies should attend her at once in the&#xD;
library.&#xD;
The Empress found them all awaiting her, when she entered&#xD;
the library, a half-hour later.&#xD;
"M. Castillo," said the Empress, seating herself beside the&#xD;
table, and addressing herself to the Minister, "what have we&#xD;
been doing since we left France?  Dreaming, and our mission&#xD;
to Europe only half accomplished!",. The little company&#xD;
looked at each other in dismay. The' Empress ! - was she better&#xD;
-restored - or had her thoughts only entered a broader chan-&#xD;
nel, that would bear her outward, to be shipwrecked upon the&#xD;
open sea?&#xD;
"This will not do, M. Castillo," continued Carlotta, "for the&#xD;
Empress -of Mexico. If she is neglectful and unfaithful, whom&#xD;
can we trust ? Do you forget that we have still to see the&#xD;
Holy Father at Rome ? We must be in Rome, at the earliest&#xD;
possible period."&#xD;
"In Rome, your Majesty? " cried Dr. Bowslaveck, with no&#xD;
attempt to conceal his anxiety. "Your Majesty cannot go !&#xD;
If there is- obliged to be an interview' with the Father, our&#xD;
Minister there and M. Castillo can effect everything. Your&#xD;
Majesty, I entreat you, remain at Miramar! -The quiet here&#xD;
will. restore you."&#xD;
"It has restored me, with your kind attention, and the watch.&#xD;
ful care of my dear ladies," she added, tenderly glancing to-&#xD;
wards them; "and, since I am restored, I cannot, sit quietly&#xD;
here and neglect what may be, - what will be," she added,&#xD;
with sudden energy, "the salvation of Mexico. I have just&#xD;
called to mind that to-morrow is the anniversary of Mexican&#xD;
independence. M:' Castillo may I entrust its celeb ation here&#xD;
to your supervision?  Our consul from Trieste, the Prefect,&#xD;
and all who are interested in our Empire, must be invited to&#xD;
say mass with us in our chapel. Say to them 'that her Majesty&#xD;
the Empress Carlotta is quite restored?' After our celebration,&#xD;

&#xD;
we must go at once to Rome. There, I know we will succeed.&#xD;
The autumn must find us in Mexico."&#xD;
Arguments were useless. The Empress seemed so entirely&#xD;
restored, physically and mentally, that each objection she over.&#xD;
ruled, and good Dr. Bowslaveck, in an agony of fear and&#xD;
anxiety, yet mixed with joy at the Empress' sudden resto.&#xD;
ration, was compelled to yield, and make preparations to ac-.&#xD;
company her. But he could not suppress the fears he enter-&#xD;
tained, lest the excitement of the journey (which was to be&#xD;
Anade by land, in consequence -of the quarantine imposed&#xD;
upon vessels coming from Trieste, which were suspected of&#xD;
cholera), the interview with the Pope, and the probable disap-&#xD;
pointment she would meet there, as at Paris, should bring a&#xD;
second mental disorder, which would not be so easily con-&#xD;
trolled as the first; whereas, if she remained. for some months&#xD;
still free from all outside communication, the blessed change&#xD;
she now manifested would doubtless become permanent.&#xD;
The celebration of the anniversary at the palace, seemed to&#xD;
rouse all the ambition of the Empress into action. Again she&#xD;
felt that she was an Empress; that a diadem glittered upon&#xD;
her brow; that she trod a high and lofty path, and filled an&#xD;
exalted position; and, in the company of dignitaries and officers&#xD;
from Trieste, who assembled. at the palace to assist at the&#xD;
Grand Mass, and partake of the banquet that followed in the&#xD;
afternoon, if curiosity prompted any heart to press forward, in&#xD;
the endeavor to discover in her Majesty's words or manner,&#xD;
some confirmation of the wild rumors that were afloat, they&#xD;
gathered from the quiet countenance, the elegant, queenly&#xD;
bearing, the regal manner, softened by the gentle affability&#xD;
that ever betrays a kindly heart, -proof to say, that "no&#xD;
shadow of cloud obscured the brightness of that brilliant intel-&#xD;
lect. The Empress may have been ill,. but her mind was still&#xD;
the same ; and to-day she was the Empress, both in body and&#xD;
in mind."&#xD;
Shall we follow the pathway, step by step, in which a mys-&#xD;
terious fate is leading the Empress of Mexico?  Shall we har-&#xD;
row the sympathetic heart with the mournful details that hang&#xD;
about that visit to Rome, and point out the hour, when, in the&#xD;
private reception-room of his Holiness at the Vatican palace,&#xD;
where, two years before, she and her noble husband had re.-&#xD;
ceived his blessing, her heart and head were racked again by&#xD;
her old enemies, pride, ambition, and disappointment, as she&#xD;
heard the father say (and he spoke truthfully), " My daughter,&#xD;
&#xD;
I have no power to aid Mexico!"  Alas ! she had not remem-&#xD;
bered when she anchored her hope to this. tenure, that the&#xD;
Emperor Napoleon's power was not limited to France, but he&#xD;
ruled at Rome through the Pope! No, no! !we can gaze with&#xD;
'tearless eye at the sacrifice as it lies upon the altar, already&#xD;
dead, but we shrink from leading it there with our own hand !&#xD;
It is enough, that the demon that had lurked about her foot-&#xD;
steps from Mexico to France, when she left the guardianship&#xD;
of the angels that had kept it back from Miramar, had only&#xD;
bided its time waiting and-watching; only tracked her more&#xD;
closely towards Rome, and there, clutched the victim with&#xD;
such triumphant certainty, that when again the Royal mistress&#xD;
came back, weary and sick in body and mind, the angels had&#xD;
lost their power, and could but silently mourn with all things&#xD;
else:&#xD;
"The Empress Carlotta.is again undone ! God have mercy&#xD;
upon her !&#xD;

CHAPTER XL.&#xD;

N  Mexico, the horizon was growing darker, and the&#xD;
clouds lowered more heavily each day. The United&#xD;
States had grown more importunate in the demand for&#xD;
, the withdrawal of the French troops, or at least in-&#xD;
sisted upon some movement tending to that end being made,&#xD;
and the Emperor Napoleon, now, since the interview with the&#xD;
Empress Carlotta, did not longer attempt to palliate his actions,&#xD;
or conceal his policies, but at once gave instructions to the com-&#xD;
mander of the French troops in Mexico, for their withdrawal;&#xD;
to begin in the autumn, and to end in the following spring.&#xD;
Not satisfied with the transmission.of these instructions -by&#xD;
telegram, and private dispatches, General Castelnau was sent&#xD;
on an embassy from .France, to see 'that they were regarded,&#xD;
and to impress upon- Marshal Bazaine their execution to the&#xD;
letter. In the meantime, preparations had been made by the&#xD;
Marshal to execute them to the best possible advantage, or the&#xD;
least ijury to Mexico. He was very naturally "loath to over-&#xD;

raise;- " so that, even in accordance with the orders of his sover.&#xD;
eign, which commanded him to stab the Empire, he endeavored&#xD;
to do it as tenderly as possible. To have decided upon the&#xD;
order of the evacuation, and the disposition of the remaining&#xD;
troops, so as to protect the strongest points, was a task worthy&#xD;
the skill of a Xenophon. The Marshal determined to withdraw&#xD;
the soldiers from the northern cities first, so that those nearest&#xD;
the capital might be the last'given up. Aftpr the entire with.&#xD;
drawal of the French, the Emperor Maximilian could still,&#xD;
with the assistance of the Austro-Belgian Corps, command a&#xD;
force sufficient to hold the capital, and the towns of the interior,&#xD;
and the seaboard.&#xD;
But through the intricate mazes of the diplomatic web that&#xD;
.had been woven in France, the Emperor Maximilian clearly&#xD;
saw, plainly understood, tle main point of the whole was&#xD;
to force him to abdication; to make things so desperate in&#xD;
Mexico, that he would be glad to get rid of them, and return&#xD;
to Miramar. ,The Emperor of .France was mistaken; he had&#xD;
not to deal with a man of his own stamp, whose principles were&#xD;
decided by the spirit of the hour. Though Maximilian knew&#xD;
that the Juarist generals were every day entering some city in&#xD;
the North, and when the assistance  of France was taken away&#xD;
would press down upon him likes the wolf on the fold, yet he&#xD;
knew that his presence held the turbulent spirit of the masses&#xD;
in check ; his presence, kept back a deluge of blood from.&#xD;
sweeping over the devoted country; and so he resolved to stand&#xD;
firm.&#xD;
As yet, the news of the Empress Carlotta's illness had not&#xD;
reached Mexico. It was known that she had left Paris for&#xD;
Miranar, where she was to remain a short while, to recover&#xD;
from the excitement and fatigue of the voyage, before pro.&#xD;
ceeding -to Rome ; but M. Castillo, with thoughtful care in the&#xD;
transmission of dispatches, had aoided all allusion to the Em-&#xD;
press's mental disorder.  ut after the return from Rome, when&#xD;
it could be kept no loner from tie Paul Pry eyes and tongues&#xD;
of the world, that the Empress arlotta's reason had left her,&#xD;
the arrow was quickly sent to the heart, to whose- happiness it&#xD;
would prove fatal.&#xD;
It came to him at Chepultepec where they had parted; and&#xD;
where, for the last few days, he had been taking rest from-&#xD;
the cares that perplexed him. In the quiet around, he had&#xD;
learned to look calmly on, almost as a spectator of the drama of&#xD;
his life; yet could not shut all hope out of his heart. Again&#xD;

and again had Marshal Bazaine, with true affection, entreated&#xD;
that he would leave Mexico for Europe - temporarily, it might&#xD;
go out to the world, as he could appoint a regency during his&#xD;
absence; and there, out of danger, he might decide whether to&#xD;
make it permanent. The good Marshal could not content him-&#xD;
self, to leave the Emperor to perish but Maximilian; could not&#xD;
content himself to go back to Europe and declare that his Em-&#xD;
pire had proven a failure. There still was a hope of success ;&#xD;
the Empress might induce the Holy Father at Rome to take&#xD;
an active interest in behalf of the Emperor ! Alas, alas !&#xD;
Marshal Bazaine had left the palace, with a troubled heart ;&#xD;
and Maximilian, feeling that he had resolved anew upon his own&#xD;
course, had gone out into the garden for a breath of the even-&#xD;
ing air. As he reached the door at the front of the palace, he&#xD;
slowly descended from the balcony, and stood upon the knoll, to&#xD;
drink in the beauty of the autumn sunset.&#xD;
There were the distant hills and valleys, the gleaming lake,&#xD;
the turrets and towers, of the city standing boldly up against&#xD;
the sky, the little villages half-hidden in the embosoming trees;&#xD;
all, rejoicing with a glow of happiness on their faces in the&#xD;
parting smile of the Western sun, that seemed loth. to leave&#xD;
the day.&#xD;
" Give up this country! " exclaimed Maximilian, enraptured&#xD;
with the scene; "give up this Eden ! Is it not worth being&#xD;
bought with blood? No ! let the French go; let Diaz and Esco-&#xD;
bedo press on upon us ! We shall contest the last inch of ground;&#xD;
and if Juarez enters the capital of Mexico, it must be over my&#xD;
dead body ! " The Emperor had thought he was alone, when he&#xD;
gave way to this burst of enthusiasm, but turning to pursue his&#xD;
walk down the lawn, his eyes, still glowing with determination,&#xD;
met those of his aid, Count Isolani.&#xD;
"Ah, Isolani ! you are here ?" said the Emperor, with more&#xD;
than usual gladness. "Look over the valley there, and you will&#xD;
shake hands and pledge me to the sentiment you overheard. Is&#xD;
it not a glorious view ? It is always new, as often as I have&#xD;
seen it before; and I never forget to watch for, and admire it.&#xD;
Come, join me in an evening promenade below the trees there;&#xD;
the air is cool and fresh And then, Isolani, I must talk with you&#xD;
after our old fashion to-night. I need it -an opening of my&#xD;
heart to some one, before I face what is to come ! "~ And passing&#xD;
his arm through the Count's, they went down the slope together,&#xD;
as the two friends of yore.&#xD;
-Since " Amen" had been said to the ending of the lessons of&#xD;

Count Isolani's love, and he felt that his life was an aimless,&#xD;
purposeless dragging,-to the final resting-place,--yet, knew&#xD;
not for what -A he had attached himself with more devotion&#xD;
than ever before to the Emperor. He would live with, and&#xD;
for him, and when the right time came -he knew it would&#xD;
come -would die for him too. Die! What a pleasant word it&#xD;
had grown to be ! For he knew, he felt, by the workings of&#xD;
some spirit undefined, that she would be with him in that&#xD;
hour ; that her face would be the last he should look upon by&#xD;
the' earth-light, and when the heavenly sun rose upon them&#xD;
together, they should be parted nevermore. He trusted they&#xD;
would both reach that Holy Land ; he knew that she was in&#xD;
her quiet home-life journeying towards it; and he, first for her&#xD;
sake, perhaps, and afterwards for the sake of the Christ to&#xD;
whom she had pointed him, -'he, - was walking towards it,&#xD;
too.&#xD;
Since the Empress Carlotta's departure, the Emperor had&#xD;
been so absorbed, that there had been but few hours passed&#xD;
with Count Isolani; but then, he had known he was there by&#xD;
his side, full of truth and devotion ; always watching and car-&#xD;
ing for this interest, so that he turned to him to-night, with&#xD;
open heart.&#xD;
"Isolani," said the Emperor again, as he walked backward&#xD;
and forward in the shadow of the great poplar and cypress&#xD;
trees, "you have not echoed my sentiment yet. Why do you&#xD;
not say Iam right ?"&#xD;
" My Prince," said the Count, using his old name for the&#xD;
Emperor, "if each soul is 'the star of its own destiny, then you&#xD;
are right!"&#xD;
"Ah ! Isolani, I have learned to deny my old words. Men&#xD;
cannot make and control circumstances. The one great cir-&#xD;
cumstance, -the chance of birth, high or low, in the palace of&#xD;
Europe, or in the wilds of Africa, determines all others. We&#xD;
may make the attempt to overturn this, but ofttimes our giant&#xD;
efforts prove a child's play, simply throwing straws on the&#xD;
storm-lashed waves of the ocean. u' You know, Isolani, how my&#xD;
heart bounded, when I came to Mexico; bow in joy, and ambi-&#xD;
tion, I dreamed of the good I was to do this people by my&#xD;
coming; and see the end.! I made the effort, - God knows I.&#xD;
did, - and see the result. Am I to be held, to account for the&#xD;
evils of to-day? Never. Fate led me here, to be disappointed.;&#xD;
to crush the spirit and life from me, - to destroy me, perhaps.&#xD;
She has thwarted mne in everything; and upon her, this unseen,&#xD;

unknown, yet terribly sensible power, do I lay the burden&#xD;
of failure."&#xD;
Maximilian's voice had lost all the gladness, which it had&#xD;
when he- had greeted his friend; they had come upon the&#xD;
subject, that for days and months had given him no peace ;&#xD;
that was never absent, that would -never pass from him, until&#xD;
he, too, passed away with it; and he spoke now with the&#xD;
same wild, fierce defiance, that had grown to be his spirit of&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
" But, my Prince," said the Count, thoughtfully, "we forget&#xD;
that Fate, Destiny, and Nature are but other names for that&#xD;
Power that does indeed control men and circumstances. In&#xD;
the beginning, when God made man, sinless and pure, and man&#xD;
fell -did he, for that, pronounce creation a failure ? Our plans,&#xD;
our 'hopes, and aims may fail in this life, but we must take care&#xD;
that the one hereafter does not fail. It does not make so much&#xD;
matter now, -for what is' time but a tiny sail upon the great&#xD;
Ocean of Eternity; and it may be, that all this disappointment,&#xD;
all this affliction, comes to us here, to make us lay hold on the&#xD;
promise of a Kingdom, where these things cannot enter."&#xD;
Earnestly, and impressively, Count Isolani had spoken, and&#xD;
as he finished, the Emperor turned and looked at him, a little&#xD;
curiously, perhaps; for he had- never heard him express such&#xD;
sentiments before. There, was something new and strange. m&#xD;
the words he had spoken, that the' Emperor liked, and yet&#xD;
they seemed new and stranger still, coming from Isolani.&#xD;
They were different from the monotonous priestly cant that he&#xD;
had listened to, all his life; they fell into his heart so deeply,&#xD;
that for a few moments he turned them over there, and said&#xD;
to himself, What matter if one does fail here, if he gains the&#xD;
hereafter ?" and then to his friend:&#xD;
" Isolani, come, let us sit here, and tell me where you have&#xD;
learned to speak these things from' your soul! You have grown&#xD;
strange to me ; we have shared all things else, and we must&#xD;
share this too !"&#xD;
By chance, they had wandered up the slope, as they had&#xD;
been speaking, into the flower-garden; and Maximilian now&#xD;
had seated himself on the rustic bench near the fountain, and&#xD;
motioned Count Isolani beside him The old association of the&#xD;
place came back to the Count; and, as they two sat there to-&#xD;
gether, and the sun went slowly down - down, behind the hills,&#xD;
he gave up to his friend the part of his life that he had kept&#xD;
back from his confidence; and when the dusk came creeping&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
stealthily upon them, the Emperor knew all, knew more, much&#xD;
more, than he had even suspected before, -knew of the deep,&#xD;
-wearying love - wearying, from its very power and fulness...'&#xD;
that dwelt in his friend's heart; knew that it had all ended in&#xD;
disappointment here; but knew that this failure would cause&#xD;
him to cry out in triumph,." Eureka ! " at the end !r&#xD;
Though his heart beat with sympathy for him, yet as Maxi-&#xD;
milian grasped his friend's hand, as he finished his-story, there&#xD;
came into his soul a great resolve, a strong promise, that though&#xD;
these trials here seemed to tear him asunder in spirit, he would&#xD;
struggle to endure them unto the end; feeling that God, not&#xD;
Fate, had sent them upon him, to lead him to that Kingdom,&#xD;
not made with hands, beyond this life !&#xD;
Ah! wondering, trembling soul, that stands doubtingly be-&#xD;
fore the stake that is raised, and the fagots that are piled to&#xD;
test thy faith, wherefore shrink from the martyr's death!&#xD;
Surely, thou hast not yet to learn, that these hours of suffering&#xD;
are the strong hours of life ; that only by fire the dross can be&#xD;
consumed. " Endure unto the end, and all shall be well ! "&#xD;
And so, while the stake was raising, and the fagots were&#xD;
piling for the Emperor of Mexico, he was preparing to triumph;&#xD;
and it was the voice of his friend that cried out to him,&#xD;
" Look up ! look up to where the crown that is eternal awaits&#xD;
thee ! "&#xD;
"Isolani," said the Emperor, as they rose to go in, "it is all&#xD;
right. God bless you, my. friend ! you have taught me this&#xD;
night, that evil may be sent, for good-to come ! "&#xD;
"And remember, my Prince, when evil does come, to have&#xD;
faith that God, not Fate, has sent it to work out good for your&#xD;
soul."&#xD;
They parted at the door of the Emperor's cabinet, and&#xD;
Count Isolani, going to his own apartment, the Emperor turned&#xD;
in alone. As he entered the little room, the beams of the rising&#xD;
moon stole through the open window, and lighted up the grain-&#xD;
ing of the plain oaken floor.&#xD;
Maximilian went to his favorite seat by the window, and be-&#xD;
gan the study of the new faith, of which he had but as yet barely&#xD;
caught a glimpse. Moonlight, with its sisters, Stillness and&#xD;
Solitude, offered no jarring outside influence to disturb his con-&#xD;
templations. Hand in hand, the trio wander on, away over hills&#xD;
and valleys, and meadows, and cities full of hurrying and bust-&#xD;
ling people, who 'pass them by unnoticed, and going their&#xD;
nightly round of the earth, come back again with lightning speed&#xD;
&#xD;
to the Emperor of Mexico, who in their absence has been&#xD;
thinking on, still the same.&#xD;
He has been thinking, as he said, if this life, with all its&#xD;
hopes and dreams, was blasted, thank God ! there is another&#xD;
yet to come, which, if secured once, is secure forever; and he&#xD;
silently prays, that both he and the Empress may not fail to&#xD;
reach it !&#xD;
The Empress ! Carlotta! his wife! -where is she at this mo-&#xD;
ment, - is she in spirit with him, as he is, with her? ~And then&#xD;
he runs over again, as he has done so many times in the years&#xD;
that have passed, their life together, from the time of their first&#xD;
love glance, to the anguished moment of parting, when the&#xD;
girl heart of the woman shut out the Empress's pride, and then&#xD;
he said aloud, again, "Thank God, she issafe: Miramar must&#xD;
be her home, whatever betide me."&#xD;
There was a tap at the door of the cabinet, and turning, he&#xD;
saw Count Isolani with the evening dispatches in his hand.&#xD;
" The courier has but just arrived," said the Count, coming&#xD;
forward, and laying the papers upon the table, and then, light-&#xD;
ing the large lamp, that stood .thereon, prepared to withdraw,&#xD;
when his attention was attracted to the Emperor, who had&#xD;
eagerly broken the seal of the first dispatch, and, with a groan.&#xD;
of deep anguish, dashed it suddenly from him.&#xD;
As Count Isolani turned to him, quickly, with an exclama-&#xD;
tion of alarm, he scarcely recognized, in the terribly agonized&#xD;
expression, the same noble face that he had seen but a mo-&#xD;
ment before.&#xD;
" Read,-read - that!/ " exclaimed Maximilian, brokenly,&#xD;
laboring under the effort of speech, and pointing to the crum-&#xD;
pled paper upon the table. " She is mad -insane! /Mad&#xD;
-insane/" he repeated, scarcely conscious. "This is the&#xD;
illness, then, with which we have been cheated of the truth,&#xD;
for a month past ! Isolani, Isolani, where is the God that&#xD;
you have been telling me of, that these things are permitted?&#xD;
Why am I hunted like a deer, and wounded each hour and&#xD;
moment, while death will not come ! I could have borne all&#xD;
-all but this ! She, too, has been, sacrificed to this miser-&#xD;
able, miserable dream! The Emperor of France began what&#xD;
Rome has finished, and she has been taken to Miramar, mad!/&#xD;
Mad ! insane !I" he again repeated, as if trying to convince him-&#xD;
self of the terrible' meaning that was bound up in those two&#xD;
short words.&#xD;
Count Isolani could offer no word of comfort, in this hour&#xD;

&#xD;
of grief, so deep and dark with the Emperor. They seemed too&#xD;
meagre of consolation, for such occasion. The'intelligence had&#xD;
come to him, a shock as unexpected, as to the Emperor, and&#xD;
he had felt that the God who had sent this dispensation, could&#xD;
alone heal the heart on which it had fallen heaviest.&#xD;
For some moments, Maximilian, with the dispatch, firmly in&#xD;
his hand, pow opening it, and reading it again, and now fiercely&#xD;
twistingit into a mere wisp, walked backward and forward,&#xD;
the length of the little cabinet. Count Isolani laid his hand&#xD;
upon the Emperor's shoulder, and would have spoken; but&#xD;
their eyes met, and each read in the depths of the other the&#xD;
words that would not come.'&#xD;
"Leave me, friend -leave me," whispered the Emperor, at&#xD;
last. I must bear this - I must wrestle with this - alone ! "&#xD;
And alone the Emperor did struggle with the giant Despair,&#xD;
that sought to bind him hand and foot..&#xD;
From hour to hour the quiet moon looked in, pityingly and&#xD;
tenderly, upon the strong man that was bidding his soul&#xD;
Suffer, and be still."&#xD;
Now he was truly alone ! Her counsel, her sympathy, and&#xD;
her love were taken from him. What had he to hope for now?&#xD;
What was life?  If he had not already closed and sealed his&#xD;
ear to Temptation's voice, it would have whispered, as lie sat&#xD;
there by the window, desolate and despairing, " Leave Mexico,&#xD;
and go'to her."  But already he felt himself pledged to his&#xD;
destiny here in Mexico. The dread phantom of dishonor that&#xD;
seemed to hover about him when his thoughts turned to a voy-&#xD;
age to the Old World, and a farewell to the New, held highest&#xD;
power in that noble heart ; and to-night, in all his grief and woe,&#xD;
he did but-say anew, " I cannot disgrace the name I bear by&#xD;
leaving Mexico. It is well; life has now lost its last charm! "&#xD;
Let the winds howl on ! The sea of Fortune, with its black-&#xD;
ening, foaming, white-crested waves, lash with fury against his&#xD;
bark. In wild glee the sweeping wind catches them up higher&#xD;
and higher, until the topmost shred of sail feels the dashing of&#xD;
the spray. The life-boatshave been lowered and manned, and&#xD;
many have put off for shore ; but the one who has launched this&#xD;
gallant ship, who has stood at her bow in days of sunshine, and&#xD;
rang his orders proudly out, stands firmly there now, with a.de-&#xD;
voted few; and together, with unflinching nerve, they watch the&#xD;
storm -watch the giant wave that is rolling nearer and nearer,&#xD;
that is to send them downward -downfard together ! watch it&#xD;
&#xD;
with unquailing hearts, though they feel that when the storm's&#xD;
might is past, these creeping waves will chime a ceaseless re-&#xD;
quiem o'er the gallant and the brave that rest beneath.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
i/ HE autumn had, amid many perplexities, dragged it-&#xD;
self away, and the winter was growing old. The bells&#xD;
of Time had rung out the knell of another year. In&#xD;
darkness and in gloom it had passed out, and in the&#xD;
lineaments of its successor, that held weal or woe for 1867&#xD;
locked in his bosom, already could be discerned, as his -eye&#xD;
rested on the Empire of Mexico, something that told' all was&#xD;
darkness for the young Emperor!&#xD;
Napoleon had kept his word to the United States;- and early&#xD;
in February long lines of soldiery, moving over the hills tow-&#xD;
ards the coast, like a ribbon of steel, with flashing bayonets&#xD;
and burnished arms, might have been seen. The French were&#xD;
to be disembarked at Vera Cruz, with as little delay as -possible,&#xD;
and Mexico must begin the death-struggle alone.&#xD;
The Emperor Maximilian waited not until the dust had fallen&#xD;
from theirs feet, to begin military movements ; all thought of&#xD;
abdication had been put aside, and with the giant fortitude that&#xD;
despair ofttimes gives to the hopeless heart, he took in the&#xD;
situation of the different departments; their relative strength&#xD;
and weakness, the position of the enemy, etc., and at once de-&#xD;
termined upon the best disposition of his own forces.&#xD;
The Juarists had been, during the past six months, -rapidly&#xD;
increasing in numbers, and had gradually taken possession of&#xD;
the upper cities as the French withdrew, until, now, the Impe-&#xD;
rial forces were only holding the larger cities of the interior,&#xD;
and preserving the communication with Vera Cruz.   There&#xD;
were three thousand Imperial troops at Puebla, to protect that&#xD;
city from falling into the hands of the enemy under General&#xD;
Diaz, who was besieging it; Mexico City was as .yet safe, and&#xD;
needed only a small force to hold it until the enemy should&#xD;
come nearer ; but at Querataro, some fifty miles to the north-&#xD;
east, there was promise of trouble. The Juarists were-massmg&#xD;
forces there, under General Fscobedo, and though General&#xD;

&#xD;
Meija held possession of the city, it was feared he might not be&#xD;
able to stand a protracted siege. So the Emperor Maximilian,&#xD;
seeing the danger that threatened that important point, deter-&#xD;
mined at once to proceed to Querataro in person, with a force&#xD;
of some eighteen hundred men, leaving Count Khevenhuller and&#xD;
the Hussars, with other troops, to protect the capital.&#xD;
All preparations for the movement of the troops from Mex-&#xD;
ico City had been completed, and they were only waiting the&#xD;
dawn of the morrow to take up their line of march.&#xD;
The Emperor had taken his farewell of Chepultepec,--alas! a&#xD;
last farewell it proved, - and was at the palace in the city for.&#xD;
the last night in the capital.&#xD;
Turn where he might now, whether to Chepultepec, that had&#xD;
almost taken the place of Miramar in his heart, or to the palace&#xD;
where they had first established their court, there was naught&#xD;
for the Emperor, save sahiess of heart and bitterness of spirit;&#xD;
for he could but contrast the buoyancy of soul with which he&#xD;
gazed first upon each, - while Hope pointed out the pleasant&#xD;
picture of a future filled with glory and honor. Now, alas !&#xD;
how changed ! There were no dreams of glory for him; no&#xD;
promise of triumph; no whisperings now that he should ever&#xD;
bear the palm aloft; there was only a stern, unrelenting voice&#xD;
that bade him pursue the path of duty ; only the cold, stony&#xD;
face of Despair met his glance when, for a moment, he&#xD;
turned his eye away from the darkness beyond, with the vain&#xD;
hope of finding one ray of comfort. And she, the one who had&#xD;
always hitherto given those words of strength that cheered him&#xD;
on; the one who had been his pride and his joy, in the beauty&#xD;
of girlhood, and the maturity of womanhood -she was now like&#xD;
" a wandering bark upon an unknown sea, with all stars to shine&#xD;
save the guiding one ! "&#xD;
General Marquez and Senor Aguirre (the Minister of War),&#xD;
who were to accompany the Emperor on the morrow, had but&#xD;
just left his Cabinet, and Maximilian, with but little hope of&#xD;
being able to corlpose himself to rest, had begun a letter to his&#xD;
brother, the Emperor of Austria, when the marshal announced&#xD;
that Count Khevenhiiller desired a few moments' audience with&#xD;
his Majesty.&#xD;
"Show him up," said the Emperor, pushing aside his writing&#xD;
material, and rising, as the Count entered.&#xD;
"Always welcome, Count," said the Emperor, extending his&#xD;
hand, " and to-night more than ever, since. you seem to bring&#xD;
with you a breath of German air."         '-&#xD;
&#xD;
" Would that your Majesty had as many here with you now,&#xD;
as love you in Germany," said the Count, as he took the Em-&#xD;
peror's hand, and seated himself in a chair near the table, which&#xD;
stood in the centre of'the room.&#xD;
"Ah ! well, Count, we are done with sighing and looking&#xD;
over the water now; these things must work themselves out&#xD;
some way, sooner or later, and whatever comes, we must be&#xD;
prepared to meet it ! This is very. kind of you, to come&#xD;
for a last .adieu. I cannot say how long it may be before we&#xD;
shall come back to the capital. If we find Meija too heavily&#xD;
pressed, we may send here for all the troops, save a small garri-&#xD;
son; at all events, Querataro must be held; -if it should fall, we&#xD;
should have the Juarists down upon.the capital here, in less than&#xD;
two days; so be in readiness, Count, with your Hussars, to move&#xD;
at a moment's notice."&#xD;
"Your Majesty, the Hussars sleep upon their arms, and are&#xD;
always found ready to do. or die for the Empire; and I come&#xD;
to-night, even at this late hour, not to say adieu, but to peti-&#xD;
tion that your Majesty will permit the Hussars to go with you&#xD;
to Querataro, in the place of the Regiment of the Empress."&#xD;
" Lopez's regiment remain at the capital ?" said the Empe-&#xD;
ror, with some surprise at Count.Khevenhiiller's petition. "I&#xD;
appreciate sincerely, my dear Count, the attachment to our&#xD;
cause which prompts this petition, but I cannot see that it is&#xD;
practicable to arrange it. It is at Colonel Lopez's own request&#xD;
that his regiment has been transferred from Puebla to Quera-&#xD;
taro. I dislike to deny either of two such brave, devoted offi-&#xD;
cers; but his petition has the precedence."&#xD;
Count Khevenhniller's brow was slightly overcast at the men-&#xD;
tion of his own naine in connection with one whom he still&#xD;
suspected of not being so true as he appeared ; and at the per-&#xD;
plexing intelligence that Colonel Lopez had made such a point&#xD;
of accompanying the Emperor, he was still more troubled.&#xD;
"Your Majesty," said he at last, "LI1am greatly tempted to&#xD;
press my claims, even in advance of those of Colonel Lopez,&#xD;
upon the score of German birth. I have known and loved your&#xD;
Majesty a few years longer than Colonel Lopez has, and to be&#xD;
very candid, I am rather skeptical of Mexican devotion in gen-&#xD;
eral, -and of that of Colonel Lopez in particular."&#xD;
Count Khevenhuller hesitated over the last words, but as he&#xD;
finished, the Emperor started, and looking earnestly at hire,&#xD;
replied, -r&#xD;
"I do not understand you, Count!. Surely you do not mean&#xD;

&#xD;
to cast a slur upon Colonel Lopez, who, if I know him aright,&#xD;
is as true a friend as I can name !"&#xD;
"Your Majesty," said the Count, earnestly, as he drew his&#xD;
chair nearer to the Emperor, and lowered his voice, " you be-&#xD;
lieve that Count Khevenhiller loves your life- as well as his&#xD;
own; you believe that he is true in word and deed, and that&#xD;
nothing could change him, or could tempt him from his duty&#xD;
to the members of the House of Hapsburg ; you believe this,&#xD;
your Majesty ! "&#xD;
"1I believe it, Khevenhiller," said the Emperor feelingly, as&#xD;
the 'Count waited for an answer.&#xD;
" Then," said he, " I can speak out. What I am going to&#xD;
say to your Majesty to-night, has borne upon my mind for&#xD;
months past. I have turned it over and over, and tried to&#xD;
discover my duty in regard to it, and never before to-night&#xD;
has my heart bade me speak. I know it is no light thing to&#xD;
breathe upon a man's good name ; and yet when our dearest&#xD;
hope is at stake, when our treasure is going from us, shall we&#xD;
trust it in the hands of one whom we believe to be a cloaked ,&#xD;
hypocrite ? I feel that I would not be guiltless, if I did not&#xD;
whisper, before your Majesty departs, a word of warning against&#xD;
Colonel Miguel Lopez!"&#xD;
" Miguel Lopez! Colonel Lopez, who is as true as steel to&#xD;
the Empire. Why, my dear Count, you are surely dreaming!"&#xD;
exclaimed the Emperor lightly. "Why, I was beginning to won-&#xD;
der what conspiracy had been gotten up for the Ides of March.&#xD;
I do not know upon what you base your suspicions or prejudice,&#xD;
Count; Lopez has been away for- six months until a few days&#xD;
since and as for doubting his faith - why, if you say much&#xD;
more, I shall grow afraid of Isolani, -yourself, or poor Navarro-&#xD;
in his grave. No, no, Count ! Suspicion seems ubiquitous in&#xD;
these days of Punic faith ; but I think you mistake Colonel&#xD;
Lopez. He only left my cabinet a couple of hours since, and&#xD;
is as deeply concerned for the Imperial success and for my per.&#xD;
sonal safety, as I am myself."&#xD;
" Ah ! " replied the Count incredulously. " A man may&#xD;
smile and smile, and be a villain still. The soil of Mexico, as&#xD;
I have said, does not nourish the strong tree of affection. But&#xD;
I believe your Majesty has more confidence in' my love of truth&#xD;
and of charity for others, than to feel that I would permit mere&#xD;
prejudice or even a personal dislike to lead me irnto traducing&#xD;
the character of another. No, your Majesty ; what I have saidt&#xD;
concerning Colonel Lopez, arises from no prejudice nor personal&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
feeling, but from a knowledge of a few acts of his, which he&#xD;
thought hidden, yet unfortunately for him, transpired to one or&#xD;
two, before his leaving Mexico City in the spring past. He&#xD;
may have changed his policy since; yet when.a principle once&#xD;
takes hold of a man of the world, it is hard to uproot it; and I&#xD;
believe it to be in Colonel Lopez's heart to-day as firmly planted&#xD;
there, as it was six months ago; and his request to accompany&#xD;
your Majesty to Querataro, only confirms me in the belief that&#xD;
he is seeking -with all his seeming devotion - a favorable&#xD;
opportunity to strike the Empire a heavy blow."&#xD;
"Khevenhuller, my dear friend, explain yourself! I feel&#xD;
that you are convinced of what you say; and yet I know you&#xD;
are wrong in your ideas of Colonel Lopez; let us understand&#xD;
this before you go further. What do you know against Colonel&#xD;
Lopez's loyalty to the Empire."&#xD;
"Iknow,"said the Count, earnestly "that before Colonel Lopez&#xD;
left for Puebla,. he was seen by an officer, whom, if necessary, I&#xD;
could name-to your Majesty, plotting with and giving information&#xD;
to spies from the enemy, in a secret apartment at Puillet's caf6."&#xD;
And the Count proceeded to give the Emperor a minute account&#xD;
of Joubert's adventure, as he had related it to him. " I am&#xD;
willing to substantiate this man's words, your Majesty," said he,&#xD;
as he finished; and then, as he noticed a peculiar smile playing&#xD;
about the Emperor's lips, he exclaimed,-&#xD;
" I beseech your Majesty,. not to disbelieve this, nor treat it so&#xD;
lightly ! I have never opened my lips of it before, because your&#xD;
Majesty was never before where Colonel Lopez could betray you;&#xD;
but now, I tremble to think, that he, too, goes to Querataro; and,&#xD;
again I beg, that if it be possible, the Hussars may go, and&#xD;
the Empress's Regiment be left here at the capital."&#xD;
"And I, Count, smiled," said the Emperor, " to think that&#xD;
I have heard the same story you have told me to-night, from\&#xD;
the' lips of Colonel Lopez himself, more than six months before.&#xD;
How we do mistake each other in this -world! While he had&#xD;
merely fallen upon a little ruse to- find out important items,&#xD;
concerning the enemy, by misleading their spies,"he is suspected&#xD;
himself of treason ! "&#xD;
Count Khevenhiiller started. Had he indeed wronged the&#xD;
man ?  Had he been led astray by Joubert, and been guilty of&#xD;
traducing the character of another-? Was Colonel Lopez a true,.&#xD;
honorable patriot, who had counterplotted against the spies&#xD;
that he had discovered in the city ? 'For a moment his con-.&#xD;
science smote him; but then he remembered the morning visit&#xD;

to Colonel Lopez's office, remembered the quailing of the eye,&#xD;
the nervous apprehension, the . cowardly threat upon his life,&#xD;
and 'his returning faith in the man gave place to doubt again.&#xD;
" Your Majesty," he said at last, " I have coyne to you to-&#xD;
night, God knows, with a pure motive. I trust, in my overween-&#xD;
ing anxiety for your Majesty's safety that I have not done&#xD;
Colonel Lopez injustice. I do not believe I have. I went to&#xD;
Colonel Lopez with this matter, and it bore ,a different phase with&#xD;
him, then, from that in which it seems he presented it to you.&#xD;
I can say nothing more. May I beg that your Majesty will&#xD;
not mention what has passed to-night ? God grant that I may&#xD;
indeed be wrong," continued the Count, in a low, earnest,&#xD;
troubled voice.&#xD;
tKhevenhller, you are a noble fellow, "said the Emperor,&#xD;
rising and laying his hand firmly on his shoulder; "but I&#xD;
must insist that you are wrong, in your estimate of character, in&#xD;
this instance. Colonel Lopez, I believe, went to Puillet's for no&#xD;
other purpose than to. find out, as he told me, from the spies,&#xD;
that he had discovered, through means of his adjutant, to be in&#xD;
the city, the real status of the Liberal cause. All that he&#xD;
learned then, he disclosed to me a few days later, and expressed&#xD;
some fear, that, if it were discovered, his actions might be&#xD;
misconstrued ; as it was, however, the information he gained'&#xD;
from them was of much service, in giving us their plan of&#xD;
action at the time. And.now, my dear Count, I, in turn, must*&#xD;
beg that you dispossess your mind of these suspicions against&#xD;
Colonel Lopez; for I feel assured,'that you will never hear of&#xD;
any action of his, but will do. him credit as a brave, high-&#xD;
minded, honorable soldier and patriot."&#xD;
"I trust so, I trust so, your Majesty," said the Count, a&#xD;
little incredulous still; "I wish I could feel as sure for Colonel&#xD;
Lopez's escutcheon in the future, as your Majesty does. May&#xD;
I ask if Colonel Lopez took the precaution to have the spies,&#xD;
he spoke of, arrested before they could leave the city.?,"&#xD;
" Ah ! doubting still; well, 'A wilfu' man maun gang his wa.'&#xD;
Colonel Lopez did not consider it necessary to order their arrest;&#xD;
since, you know, a hundred men,. adventurers, who may act as&#xD;
spies, go in and out each day."&#xD;
Count Khevenhuller had risen to go, and now, as he stood be-&#xD;
side the Emperor, whose noble countenance seemed so full of&#xD;
trust, and so free from all suspicion, he saw that if Colonel&#xD;
Lopez should choose him as. a victim of his treachery, he could&#xD;
stab him in the dark, easily enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is growing late, your Majesty, and I must say Adieu.&#xD;
If reinforcements are needed, may I rely upon it the Hussars&#xD;
shall be ordered ?"&#xD;
"Ah ! I wish you were going with us to-morrow, Count;-&#xD;
and believe me, Ieam grateful to you," continued Maximilian,&#xD;
earnestly, as he reached out his hand, " for the interest that&#xD;
has brought you to me to-night. Isolani and yourself, I&#xD;
feel, are bound to me by hooks of steel. You came from Ger-&#xD;
many for my sake, and, Count, if it should prove that all those&#xD;
hopes we cherished together, should be utterly fruitless; if&#xD;
there should be no repayal for these years of labor, and care&#xD;
- promise me, when you go back alone to Germany, and&#xD;
mayhap, in some noble gathering, the name of the Emperor&#xD;
Maximilian ofJ Mexico is mentioned,- promise me, that his&#xD;
name and his memory shall be handled tenderly, as it deserves ;&#xD;
promise me, that there shall be a voice raised to justify the&#xD;
one who will then be powerless to offer a word in his own&#xD;
behalf ! Say that Maximilian did his duty; nay, more, that he&#xD;
struggled to do good to his fellow-men, and if he was not suc-&#xD;
cessful, it was his misfortune, not his fault. You will sathis&#xD;
Khevenhiiller ?"               is     .     - - ay      ,&#xD;
The Emperor still stood by, his side-; and as Count Kheven-&#xD;
huller listened to the wdrds so full of foreboding and evil, and&#xD;
then again looked up at the tall, erect figure, the open, hand-&#xD;
some face, that wore now a shade of sadness, and his eye resting&#xD;
on the gold buttons and bright lace of the Emperor's uniform,&#xD;
the tears stole into his eyes, and he felt that Mexico had not&#xD;
been worthy of so noble a ruler; that there was no altar holy&#xD;
enough for such a sacrifice.&#xD;
"Your Majesty, neither Isolani ndr I will ever leave the&#xD;
standard of the Emperor Maximilian'!   We will never go&#xD;
back to Germany without you; living or dead our duty, our&#xD;
pleasure is to serve you. How many voices are there in Ger-&#xD;
many now, calling out to you, 'Our Prince, our Prince, come&#xD;
back to us !'"&#xD;
" Ah! Count, I see whither you are drifting now. I have&#xD;
cast anchor here, and if my bark is not strong enough to stand&#xD;
the beating of the storms, it must go. to pieces.I I am willing&#xD;
to give my life to the Empire; but I trust Isolani and yourself&#xD;
may be spared to tell the 'story of our woes, long years to&#xD;
come.' But this will make cowards of us ; whatever Fate&#xD;
has for us, we must 'act.,well our part; there all the honor lies.'&#xD;

You are going, Count? then au revoir. I will not say adieu.&#xD;
Long live the Hussars!"&#xD;
The Count raised the Emperor's hand to his lips, and, with&#xD;
an earnest repetition of his "Au revoir," left the cabinet.&#xD;
Au revoir! not adieu, -not farewell!&#xD;
"For in that word - that fatal word - however&#xD;
We promise, -hope, -believe, -there breathes despair."&#xD;
The Emperor, alone again, turned to a low couch that occu-&#xD;
pied one corner of the room. His mind did not entertain the&#xD;
suspicions that Count Khevenhuller had presented of his friend&#xD;
and officer one moment. Maximilian spoke truly, when he said&#xD;
that he would as soon doubt Navarro in his grave, as Miguel&#xD;
Lopez. Doubtless there were those among his officers and&#xD;
men, who now since the cause of the Empire was failing, felt&#xD;
their hearts turning, after the manner of worldly policy, to the&#xD;
side where the strength lay, but Colonel Lopez was not to be found&#xD;
among this number. As the Emperor looked out upon the&#xD;
moonlit Plaza, and then sankl upon his couch, to steal a few&#xD;
hours of quiet before the morrow's dawn, he exclaimed again, -&#xD;
"How we mistake each other in this little world ! Lopez&#xD;
and Khevenhaller, both true, both willing to die for the same&#xD;
cause, and yet so far apart in their'reckoning of each other ! "&#xD;
And he, alas ! more sadly mistaken than either !&#xD;
The hours wore on, and the Emperor slept ; not the haunted,&#xD;
dreamy slumber of the care-weary man, but once more the in-&#xD;
nocent, conscience-clear sleep of youth. On the morrow he&#xD;
must take up the burden again; on the morrow he will begin,&#xD;
the march to the "unseen kingdom of death; but in these&#xD;
midnight hours, with the song of the breeze without, and the&#xD;
dimming light of the lone lamp within, casting ghostly shadows&#xD;
from the historic faces on the walls, to the oaken 'floor beneath,&#xD;
let him rest ! let him rest !"~       ~&#xD;

CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
&#xD;
Anita, you have''forgotten Don Pedro, for once!"",&#xD;
- said Inez, cheerily, as she entered her aunt's sitting-&#xD;
room at their home, and found Anita engaged in mend-&#xD;
ing a rent in her lace-veil. " What is going to happen ?&#xD;
I think you are growing tired of the Cid, and Don Roderick, and&#xD;
Don Pedro, you neglect them so of late."&#xD;
" Ah! Inez," said Anita, looking up with a return smile,&#xD;
" you know I am growing too old for poetry and romance now.&#xD;
But you too have forgotten something this morning; the look&#xD;
of sadness is left behind ! "&#xD;
"Ah, yes! and do you know why ? The Emperor is coming&#xD;
with his soldiers from, Mexico to-day ; and it is a time of joy&#xD;
for all good Imperialists. We shall be safe now ! See, Anita,&#xD;
Escobedo's tents there, don't seem half so near ; and' the bay-&#xD;
onets that flash so, each morning, wont look half so fierce, will&#xD;
they?  They may sound thei- drums and trumpets at us now&#xD;
in vain, for they can hardly devour us,' while the Emperor&#xD;
stands between!"&#xD;
As she spoke, Inez went to the window, and drawing the cur-&#xD;
tains back, and opening the casement wide, looked abroad with&#xD;
more complacency, perhaps,than she had done in many days&#xD;
before, upon the beautiful prospect of valley and glade, warm-&#xD;
ing in the sunlight. There was but one feature to mar the plea-&#xD;
sure of the contemplation to Inez; away in the distance, half-&#xD;
obscured by the vapory mist that curled about the rising hill-&#xD;
side, and half-revealed,, here and there, where the light was&#xD;
strongest, shone the white tents of Escobedo's forces.&#xD;
As she stands there, looking out quietly, with features all&#xD;
in repose, we may note- that Inez has scarcely changed since'she&#xD;
left the capital, more than six months ago. There have been n6&#xD;
upheaving billows to break the smooth current of her life. It&#xD;
has passed in uninterrupted quietude of thought and action.&#xD;
A visit to Anita and herself, now and then, from the priestly&#xD;
Father who has charge of the little chapel at the Convent where&#xD;
they worship, and the daily walk to the city to attend mass&#xD;
or vespers, is all they have known of the outside world. The&#xD;

&#xD;
look of sadness which had come to be such a sore trouble to&#xD;
Anita, had grown quite natural to the noble face, and the deep&#xD;
light in the large dark eyes, was, perhaps, softer, more tender,&#xD;
more holy, than ever before. The face, with an upward look,&#xD;
would be perhaps that of Faith " waiting and watching."  To-&#xD;
day, though, as Anita said, some of the weariness was gone, and&#xD;
a smile had half driven the shadow away.&#xD;
" Yes, Anita," she said, as she turned away from the window&#xD;
to assist her aunt in arranging the veil that she had repaired,&#xD;
about her head in the old Spanish style, to which Anita still&#xD;
clung ; " the day is here at last; and if we waste'much time we&#xD;
shall be too late to see the triumphal entry. Sister Th6rese&#xD;
charged me, as I came out from vespers last afternoon, that we&#xD;
should meet the Sisters at the cathedral on the Plaza at ten.&#xD;
From the windows of the organ-loft, we shall have a grand&#xD;
view of the whole scene."&#xD;
"Sister Therese is very kind, Inez. My heart is with the&#xD;
Emperor, and I wish him joy and success everywhere; but I&#xD;
am growing almost too old tp mix so much with the world-;&#xD;
you had better take old Pedro with you as far as the cathedral,&#xD;
and I will remain at home."&#xD;
" Dear Anita, you grow old? " said Inez, tenderly passing&#xD;
her arm about her, and drawing her to the window: "not yet,&#xD;
Anita ; you are all I have left, and you must not "think of&#xD;
growing old."&#xD;
"Ali! mia cara / we may not speak of it, but Time does&#xD;
not forget us. He leaves, his touch here," pushing back the&#xD;
folds of the veil, and showing the dark hair sprinkled with&#xD;
silver ; "and each year there is a new furrow on the brow. The&#xD;
old reaper is ceaselessly sweeping the earth with his scythe,&#xD;
and some day, it may be far or near, Anita's turn will come.&#xD;
Well! she will not much care ; it will only be one sheaf more,&#xD;
she..trusts, gathered into the garner. The spring-time is gone&#xD;
from Anita now, and there is nothing for her but the snows of&#xD;
winter, and she does not care to be left for those -if she only&#xD;
knew where her flower here, would be slheltered when she was&#xD;
gone."&#xD;
Anita was not given to much speaking; but in her quiet way&#xD;
her mind was always busy, and she was' right now. She was&#xD;
growing old, and this morning she had touched the one care that&#xD;
the thQught of-Death, whom she saw not so very far in the&#xD;
distance, standing in her pathway, gave her. How would Inez&#xD;
be cared for ? There had been a time, even after Giulian's&#xD;
&#xD;
death, when in casting a horoscope for her future, she had&#xD;
thought that there was another - Count Isolani- who in time&#xD;
might stand in Giulian's place.. But that hope had passed ;&#xD;
while watching her child's life, Anita had discerned the trials'&#xD;
through which she had passed ; for in the great sweeping, tide&#xD;
that ebbed and flowed each day, no wave rolled up to Inez,&#xD;
without touching her feet also. And now, as she looked at&#xD;
Inez, she could but think, in reviewing their past, how depend-&#xD;
ent they two had ever been on each other. Juan gone, they&#xD;
knew nor cared not whither, -for worse than dead he was to&#xD;
them, - and now if either were taken, what desolation there&#xD;
would be for the other !&#xD;
" Anita ! my mother !_" said Inez softly, " you cannever grow&#xD;
old to me. To-day you are the same as in the memory&#xD;
of my little girlhood, and I sometimes wonder, Anita, that&#xD;
God did not take the little infant home, instead of -leaving it&#xD;
here, to wear out your life. My hope is to *see you happy&#xD;
again, Anita;- to see you in Madrid; my hope -for you is, that&#xD;
Anita's sun may set behind the old mountains of Castile ! "&#xD;
"Ah ! it matters little for me, Inez, where, it sets on earth,&#xD;
so that it rises for the second life in Heaven. But you, my&#xD;
child - what will there be for you, when Anita is gone?1"&#xD;
" Have you forgotten, Anita, that the Church provides a&#xD;
place for those who are desolate and'comfortless; where, as one&#xD;
of the blessed Sisterhood, they may fill a higher, holier mission&#xD;
than weeping, and mourning, and tossing upon the billows of&#xD;
life? Anchored in the bosom of the Church, a weary soul may&#xD;
cling to the Rock of Ages ; and I think, Anita, my future will&#xD;
be with those holy women; my feet already turn towards the&#xD;
path in which they tread, and I often wonder why I delay even&#xD;
now, taking up the life to which my heart is driving me.&#xD;
Each morn, when I stand in the little chapel of the old convent,&#xD;
and in the early light look over the dark' bowed figures, and&#xD;
think what their life is, -devotion to their Father's work, min-&#xD;
istering to the afflicted ones, as their Master' bade them do,--&#xD;
when I think then of the great, broad field of the world, and&#xD;
the few who labor thus, my- heart asks itself, ' Why dost thou&#xD;
stand here, all the day idle?  Go thou and do likewise;' and&#xD;
then I go on saying to myself, that perhaps we ought to go to&#xD;
Madrid ;- you, to my uncle, of whom, you have often told me,&#xD;
and I, to the old convent where you and my mother were&#xD;
brought up."&#xD;
"But, my -child, though I feel that there you would be&#xD;

safe, yet the life of a Sister of Mercy Must be taken, not alone&#xD;
from the thought of a moment. It is not merely an asylum for&#xD;
those who are wary and desolate; it is a noble life, for those&#xD;
who love God better than Mammon. The treasure, Inez, must&#xD;
be laid up in Heaven, that the heart may be drawn upward&#xD;
too; there must be no lingering earth-ties."&#xD;
Aiita did not say to Inez all she thought; did not say to&#xD;
her that perhaps, in the starting-point, she was wrong in yield-&#xD;
ing her life's happiness for an idea of duty to the memory of&#xD;
Giulian; did not say to her, that perhaps the mission of wife&#xD;
and mother- woman's true mission -holy and sanctified by the&#xD;
word of God, was a noble sphere, and worthy a woman's life ;&#xD;
and perhaps the labor in the home-circle brought in the end a&#xD;
richer harvest than was gathered by those who sowed and&#xD;
reaped in the world's broad field, where oftentimes the tares&#xD;
choke out the tiny grain. Anita did not say all this; but the&#xD;
hope was alive at this moment, down in -her child-heart, that&#xD;
perhaps Victor Isolani would yet stand between her and, all&#xD;
vows save those which should bind her to him for better .r&#xD;
worse. Count Isolani would come with the Emperor perhaps,&#xD;
and, then Love might take its course. Inez might yet be happy.&#xD;
Anita said nothing of all this.&#xD;
" Ah ! well, Anita, this is all in the future ; and we shall&#xD;
'be cared for, as the sparrows are. God sends each soul to its&#xD;
own field of labor, and in His own time He will send us to&#xD;
ours. Now, our duty seems to be only to sit still and wait."&#xD;
Anita wondered, as Inez spoke, if her duty in life had been&#xD;
centred on that one flower ; and her heart answered to her&#xD;
mute questioning, "Yea." Truly, yes, Anita ! and as noble art&#xD;
thou, who didst teach those infant lips to murmur, " Our Father&#xD;
in Heaven;" who didst guide those little feet into the paths&#xD;
of Truth and Virtue ; who didst bind the precepts of Reli-&#xD;
gion, Mercy, and Love upon that youthful brow, - as noble&#xD;
art thou, and as worthy of homage among men, as 'he that&#xD;
taketh a city ; " and more worthy of a crown above; for thou&#xD;
hast prepared one soul for life eternal ! ".&#xD;
" Well, you will go this morning to see the Emperor?" said&#xD;
Inez, as they turned away from the window ; and then, as she&#xD;
noted the anxious look still resting on Anita's face, she added:&#xD;
" Don't let anything I say grieve you, Afiita! This must be a&#xD;
joyful day. I will come down again in an hour ; and you will,&#xD;
be ready to go with me ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JEWELS.              359&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, I guess I must go to-day; I must see the Emperor&#xD;
again, so I shall be ready."&#xD;
The day was bright and clear, and the great bells from&#xD;
cathedral and convent, tower and steeple, were ringing their&#xD;
joy loudly forth, their brazen tongues shouting out their gladness,&#xD;
in tones of triumph, f4r above all other sounds.&#xD;
Horsemen clad in their brightest uniform were dashing up&#xD;
and down the stony, streets, as if in hurried preparation.&#xD;
The Plaza was throriged with crowds of men, women, and&#xD;
children  in gay holiday attire.  The shop- windows and&#xD;
fronts in the cortal wear the aspect of festive display ; while&#xD;
on the residence streets farther off, from every-window floated&#xD;
a flag ; and through the huge gates .of the court-yard, as one&#xD;
casts a glance, the water of the fountains seems to sparkle more&#xD;
brightly, and the flowers that fill up the parterres between cor-&#xD;
ridors, seem more prodigal of their sweets than they are wont&#xD;
to be.&#xD;
There is but one sentiment beaming in the eye, and speaking in&#xD;
the smile, that rests on every face. "The Emperor is coming !"&#xD;
The people of Querataro were earnestly sincere. With one&#xD;
accord they were gathering to welcome their Sovereign; for at&#xD;
this moment they felt that his coming would relieve them from&#xD;
all care, and all anxiety. Those who have known what it is to&#xD;
be but a day's, nay, but an hour's remove from the power of an&#xD;
enemy, - to know they are only over the hill, waiting to strike;&#xD;
to see them moving to and fro "like leaves of the forest, when&#xD;
summer is green, and the sheen of their spears are like stars of&#xD;
the sea;" to hear, morning, noon, and night, the roll of the&#xD;
drum, that may, to-morrow, sound through their streets, a&#xD;
mocking requiem to their slaughtered dead ; and then, when&#xD;
Despair sits in almost every heart, to look, and see winding&#xD;
afar over the hills a host that bears one's own banner, and know&#xD;
they are coming - those friends, brave and true, who will die&#xD;
to defend that city,.-you who have felt this, cry out in your&#xD;
heart with the people of Querataro, to-day, " Long live the Em-&#xD;
peror ! Long live the soldiers of the Empire ! "&#xD;
True, they had already that lion by their side - the warlike&#xD;
Meija; but he had only three thousand men, and.there over&#xD;
the hill was Escobedo, the enemy, with thirty thousand. So,&#xD;
in the plenitude of joy, great and small, young and old, the&#xD;
nobility in their lumbering carriages, soldiers on horseback,&#xD;
rancheros, lepers, ndian and white, all were out for agala-day.&#xD;
On the Plaza there was a .strange mingling of the priestly&#xD;
&#xD;
Lliii&#xD;

&#xD;
robes of the padres with the sarapes and rebosas of the lower&#xD;
orders and the leperos.&#xD;
Out of the city, the road in the direction of the capital&#xD;
was lined by the multitude that had followed in the wake of&#xD;
the soldiery, which had gone out in rank, to meet the coming&#xD;
reinforcements.&#xD;
At last the shout rang forward till those on the Plaza caught&#xD;
it: "'L'Empereur ! L'Empereur ! "  Louder and louder it grew,'"&#xD;
now swelling on the breeze, and. now softening in the confused&#xD;
murmur of voices.&#xD;
They have entered the city amid the sound of drum and&#xD;
fife, and the shouting of the multitude. Proudly they tread&#xD;
on through the streets; now, a body of infantry, who have&#xD;
marched from the capital, but who to-day have forgotten all&#xD;
fatigue ; the tramping, clattering cavalry are moving past; the&#xD;
artillery rumbles along; and now, escorted by the officers, Gen-&#xD;
erals Meija and Miramon, and followed by his staff, a body&#xD;
of noble, handsome men, comes the Emperor Maximilian&#xD;
himself !&#xD;
More than an hour since Anita and Inez had joined the&#xD;
dark-robed Sisters, and had taken their places at the great win-&#xD;
dow of the Cathedral, overlooking the Plaza; and they, with .&#xD;
the others, who were waiting in anxious expectation, caught&#xD;
the shouts of the triumphant procession that was coming nearer&#xD;
and nearer to the Plaza.&#xD;
The troops that had come from Mexico, are conducted at&#xD;
once to the place of encampment just without the city ; but&#xD;
the clamorings of the people prevent the thought of rest with&#xD;
the Emperor; so, escorted by the welcoming corps; the com-&#xD;
manding generals, and the officers of his Staff, he turns into the&#xD;
Plaza.&#xD;
The "vivas " ring out from a. thousand voices, long and&#xD;
loud, as the Emperor reaches the middle of the square and the&#xD;
company halts.&#xD;
"See, see, Inez ! " exclaimed Anita, as they -leaned over the&#xD;
stone casement of the old window to catch a full view. "See&#xD;
our noble Emperor there, with General Meija beside him! "&#xD;
Not one,-in casting an eye over that body of brave men,&#xD;
could have mistaken the young Emperor of Mexico. In the&#xD;
dark blue habit of a Mexican General, the gold-embroidered,&#xD;
tops of the heavy cavalry boots glistening, and the sword which&#xD;
hung at his side flashing in the sunlight, he sat proudly the&#xD;
splendid war-horse, that impatiently and restlessly chafed the&#xD;
&#xD;
bit, and stamped the stony pavement. A nobler monarch"&#xD;
never ruled a people !&#xD;
"Yes, yes 7"-cried Inez, catching the spirit of enthusiasm,&#xD;
which the Emperor's presence sent from heart to heart ; " the&#xD;
Emperor himself! - Ah ! if the Empress Carlotta could only&#xD;
see him this moment ! Hear how they shout, ' Long live the&#xD;
Empire!1' How can the Empire fail with such a leader ?"&#xD;
"And look there, Inez! " cried Akita, again, as the offi-&#xD;
cers of the staff, rode forward; "there is Count Isolani! Do&#xD;
you remember him? See! he is looking up ! "&#xD;
Inez was leaning forward when Anita spoke. She had been&#xD;
watching the Emperor so closely, that no one else upon the Plaza&#xD;
had been seen or heard ; but as the name of "Count Isolani "&#xD;
fell upon her ear, she was startled-.to herself again, and drew&#xD;
herself back. She had not been quick enough. As she turned,&#xD;
a party of officers passed just beneath, and looking up to&#xD;
the window where the Sisters stood, raised their caps in -re-&#xD;
spectful obeisance. Inez had seen but one, among them,&#xD;
had felt the gaze of but one pair of dark, earnest eyes, that&#xD;
long, long ago, had burned their impress upon her heart. It&#xD;
was Count Isolani!&#xD;
Anita turned as. they passed; and as she noted the pallor&#xD;
that had overspread Inez's face, and the hasty arranging of her&#xD;
veil, she knew that all' earth-love --all earth-ties -- were not&#xD;
dead, were not severed yet.&#xD;
Yes, he was there, and had seen her ; the wave of his hand&#xD;
as he touched his hat told her that her face he could never&#xD;
forget or mistake. It was true, the thought' had come to her&#xD;
before, that he would conle with the Emperor to Querataro;&#xD;
but then she had not realized that she was to see him. She&#xD;
had learned to think of him as she did of the dead; and he&#xD;
would be. no nearer to her in.spirit in Querataro, than if the&#xD;
ocean rolled between them; for, alas! it was not' distance that&#xD;
divided them!&#xD;
There was time for no more; the, noise and shouting had&#xD;
ceased, and the multitude, with uncovered heads, waited to&#xD;
hear what their Emperor would say in greeting them.'.&#xD;
As Maximilian sat there in the midst of his officersand,,in&#xD;
that moment .of silence, cast his, glance over the sea of. up-&#xD;
turned faces, and recalled the shouts of joy, and the acolama=&#xD;
tions of triumphant exultation, scarcely lost upon the breeze,&#xD;
with which the people of -Querataro had welcomed him, his&#xD;
heart, that had of late grown a little unused to such, and had&#xD;

treachery, warmed toward these citizens with tender love.&#xD;
Today there was a burst of sunlight across his path, s'&#xD;
darkened by clouds. Whatever doubts he had for- some&#xD;
months past entertained as to his acceptability as a ruler, were&#xD;
at this moment dispelled ; for he felt that the heart of this&#xD;
people beat in unison with his. They rejoiced with him, and&#xD;
mourned with him; they loved him, and trusted him; and he&#xD;
would be true to them. A feeling of strength not altogether&#xD;
unmixed with hope, came over him, and he swore inwardly that&#xD;
he would protect them. This should be his Thermopylae; if&#xD;
his life must go, it should go in defence of Querataro.&#xD;
The crowd was growing impatient; they were anxious to&#xD;
hear the sound of his Majesty's voice; and the Emperor felt&#xD;
that he must speak now, and think another time.&#xD;
"People of Querataro!" he began, conquering his emotion,&#xD;
"'we need make no explanation for our presence. here to-day.&#xD;
You needed us, and we have-come. Children of my Empire !&#xD;

&#xD;
It is the calm of prosperity, the strength of united parties,&#xD;
the blissful calmness of peace, that Mexico must have, to build&#xD;
up a monument worthy of herself; and it is for this we strive.&#xD;
Without bloodshed; if it was possible, was our hope. We&#xD;
communicated personally with the chiefs who claim to fight&#xD;
in the name of liberty and the principles of progress, to induce&#xD;
them to submit the question of the form of government and&#xD;
ruler, as we are willing to do, to the national vote. What was&#xD;
their answer?  They have responded to me by ordering loyal&#xD;
and distinguished citizens to be executed; they have repulsed&#xD;
the fraternal hand which was.extended; they have worked as&#xD;
blind partisans, who know no other means of governing but&#xD;
the sword. There is nothing left then for us, for those who&#xD;
are the true lovers of liberty, but to work with the greatest&#xD;
energy to restore it to the people, and we shall feel that we are&#xD;
the nation's true defenders. This question, people of Querataro,&#xD;
may be settled here, with the enemy who overlook you. God&#xD;
grant that this may be the end of the struggle ! God grant&#xD;
that the sword of Mexican and brother Mexican may clash&#xD;
for the last time at the conflict for which we now gather&#xD;
strength! And then may Peace--blessed Peace! brood like&#xD;
a dove over the length and breadth of this land. Should the&#xD;
issue be at Empire or a Republic, an Emperor or a President,&#xD;
may all be well with this nation ; it shall be accepted by us. It&#xD;
shall never be said that the Emperor Maximihan stood in his&#xD;
people's way; that he loved himself better than them ! No, no,&#xD;
my people;.remember that your Emperor labors for your good&#xD;
only ; that he loves you first, and his own life, only as he may be&#xD;
spared to save you! "&#xD;
"Viva l'Empire ! We will have the Emperor Maximilian&#xD;
for our ruler ! God bless our Emperor ! " came up again and&#xD;
again in united voice. " They give, up the Emperor for Juarez;&#xD;
they give a noble patriot for an ambitious revolutionist!"&#xD;
Ah! if the decision had but been submitted to the people of&#xD;
Querataro!&#xD;
The day wore on and drew to its close, as all days must,&#xD;
whether filled up with joy and gladness, or with sorrow and&#xD;
mourning.&#xD;
The Emperor and his staff escaping from the clamorous and&#xD;
demonstrative joy of the people on the Plaza, were conducted&#xD;
to the apartments at the Casino that had been fittell up for&#xD;
their use. The Emperor consented to occupy them for only a&#xD;
few days, for he felt his place was with' his soldiers; whatever&#xD;

&#xD;
comforts were accorded to them were enough for him likewise-&#xD;
and the inconveniences and hardships that fell to their lot, he&#xD;
was willing to share.&#xD;
It was long after the' daylight had gone: darkness had&#xD;
closed in, and night had spread a solemn hush over the city.&#xD;
The people, tired out with joy, and secure in the presence of&#xD;
their Emperor, had long since gone to rest, and the streets were&#xD;
well-nigh deserted. A few scattering moonbeams straggled&#xD;
through the breaks in the drifting clouds, and fell over the stone&#xD;
towers of the old cathedral pile, glanced across the open Plaza,&#xD;
glinting here and there on a satined orange-lea, that shone as a&#xD;
miniature crystal sheen in the darkness; while from. the hidden&#xD;
blossoms of the rows of orange-trees that crossed the centre,&#xD;
came forth a soft, exquisite odor.&#xD;
The Plaza, too,was deserted, save, perhaps, a wretched lepero,&#xD;
who finishing, one more day of beggar life; came to the night&#xD;
".without where to lay his head,"- and crept stealthily under&#xD;
the shade of the orange-trees, to wait for another dawn, -de-&#xD;
serted, save one; one who backward and forward kept up a&#xD;
restless step on the stone pavement that looked up to the gray,&#xD;
sombre front of the Cathedral.&#xD;
Victor Isolani had left his companions at the Casino to seek,&#xD;
the rest that was not for him; for while his| heart, his brain,&#xD;
was on fire, it was air, stillness, solitude, that he must have.&#xD;
The bitter drop had not been left out of the day's cup of joy to&#xD;
him. From the moment that his eyes had taken in again the&#xD;
face of the one he had enshrined in his heart as a watching&#xD;
saint when he had seen again the nobility, the goodness, the&#xD;
beauty of the one whom his eyes had forsworn forever to look&#xD;
upon with earth-love, all beside had been lost on him. The&#xD;
turmoil of the multitude, the moving to and fro, the compli-&#xD;
ments that seemed so empty, the jests so pointless, so ill-timed,&#xD;
oppressed and stifled him; he longed for the coming of the&#xD;
midnight hour, when his heart should be free to beat against its&#xD;
bars; should be free to test the strength of its bonds.&#xD;
He had come here, where he had seen her; and as he looked&#xD;
up to the great gothic window where, she had stood,. he seemed&#xD;
to feel that she had left something of her presence behind ; that&#xD;
the atmosphere was purer and holier on this spot than else-&#xD;
where; that there were inspirations of strength here that he&#xD;
could Ifind nowhere beside. He had seen .' her there in the&#xD;
noonday with the holy Sisters, and he had not noted if' she&#xD;
were different from the rest ; but what mattered it, if she wer8&#xD;
&#xD;
one of them? What mattered it if she, too, had taken the holy&#xD;
vows? It did not change her in his heart. She was there, his&#xD;
guardian spirit ; he gave her up on earth, but she was to be his&#xD;
own in heaven. He had thought, when he pledged to her, at&#xD;
their last parting, that they should meet no more, that it wouId&#xD;
be so ; and in coming to Querataro, he had no thought to seek&#xD;
her out; but chance had given them what each; perhaps, needed&#xD;
for strength to press on in their journey. And that journey?&#xD;
When, - where, thought Count Isolani, as he passed his hand&#xD;
over his brow, when should he or they reach its end ? Was it&#xD;
for him away -away down the three-score and ten?- Was it for&#xD;
her, when the raven hair was whitened, and the dark eyes were&#xD;
dimmed ? There was to be fighting here at Querataro; perhaps&#xD;
the end might come to him when the field was hottest and the&#xD;
drum was loudest. Well, come when it would, he had strength&#xD;
to meet it!  There was a tinge, perhaps, of pleasure, in the&#xD;
thought that, should he meet the soldier's fate here, perhaps&#xD;
Inez might come to him; perhaps she' might close his eyes&#xD;
under the coffin lid; perhaps she might enwreath his grave with&#xD;
flowers wet with the dew of tears. His country and his Godi&#xD;
to them his duty was. Her duty, 'she had said, "lay in the&#xD;
keeping of a vow; and for his life's happiness he must not&#xD;
tempt her to sin by breaking it.&#xD;
And so he thought,on, all alone in the still watches of the&#xD;
night ; thought of his life, the part of his life in Germany, shut&#xD;
off by the broad Atlantic, and wondered if the heart that spake&#xD;
to him to-night of duty, of resignation, of heaven, was- the&#xD;
same that, in the olden youthful time, had, known no master,&#xD;
had gone out and come in only at its own bidding! And won-&#xD;
dered too, should his feet ever tread again those sunny slopes&#xD;
of the Tyrol; should his eyes ever look up to the grand hills&#xD;
and the, towering Alps, that lay beyond the old castle where&#xD;
his ancestors had dwelt ?  Ah! that future is curtained wisely-&#xD;
in, and all the calling, here wakes no echo from the hills that&#xD;
are before. Victor Isolani, wondering and asking in, vain,&#xD;
turned away from the Plaza before the first rays of the dawn&#xD;
enveloped it in mist, contented to wait and hear the message&#xD;
-each day as it came and went.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE presence of the Emperor Maximilian at Querataro&#xD;
was as inspiring to the officers and soldiers of the&#xD;
division stationed there, as to the people The hope-&#xD;
less desperation, the utter despair of all things earthly,&#xD;
the indifference to life or death, that filled the Emperor's heart'&#xD;
now since the last stroke had fallen -upon him in the affliction&#xD;
of the Empress Carlotta, gave to him a freedom 'from fear, a&#xD;
daring courage, that was mistaken by all, save those who knew&#xD;
him best, for confident hope, determination, and certainty of&#xD;
ultimate success. And, as faithfully as if indeed he trusted to&#xD;
win again his fortunes upon the die to be thrown here at Que-&#xD;
rataro, did the Emperor labor to-,secure to the Empire all. ad-&#xD;
vantages. Each day saw him in the saddle, overlooking the&#xD;
fortifications which the soldiers were throwing up beyond the&#xD;
city ; and each night he was in the camps of the men, moving&#xD;
among them like a "spirit, giant born," commanding love and&#xD;
homage, yet full of sympathy and condescension. Never before&#xD;
had the soldiers of the army and the officers felt such unity of&#xD;
purpose as now; for all knew that if they were successful here,.&#xD;
there was a chance for the Empire; if they failed, -all was lost:&#xD;
so all worked with heart and soul together. There were Gen-&#xD;
erals Mendez, Miramon, Marquez, Meija, Castillo, all resting.&#xD;
neither night nor day, but lending their aid to the Emperor in&#xD;
the supervision of the fortifications.&#xD;
It was not until The middle of March that the first attack.&#xD;
was made by the forces of Escobedo; and though its result was&#xD;
the repulsing of the Liberals, the Emperor only saw but too&#xD;
clearly that he could never hold out against the superior force&#xD;
of the enemy in a regular engagement, though be might now&#xD;
and then be successful in a sortie. And, too, he had not pro-&#xD;
visions enough to stand a long siege. In view of the latter.&#xD;
event, General Marquez was ordered to the capital, with a&#xD;
thousand men, to obtain re-enforcements and secure provisions&#xD;
and munitions of war, and to return in a space of fifteen days.&#xD;
In the meantime, it was the policy to keep off an attack from&#xD;
Querataro until Marquez should return.&#xD;
A period of' anxious waiting it was; and to better preserve&#xD;
&#xD;
the ignorance of the enemy in regard to his weakness, the&#xD;
Emperor ordered a sortie to be made every few days, always&#xD;
appearing with the troops himself, and always returning to&#xD;
the city successful. Time passed on: the fifteen days were&#xD;
gone, and Marquez had not returned. Provisions were getting&#xD;
scarce, and the poor were beginning to suffer. It was at this&#xD;
period that the noble, unselfish heart of the Emperor displayed&#xD;
itself. In the hospitals, by the bedside 9f the wounded soldier;&#xD;
giving charity to the widows of those who had fallen on the&#xD;
field; reducing the rates of provisions, which, in consequence of&#xD;
the scanty supply, placed them almost beyond reach of the&#xD;
poor, so that all might share alike, -he seemed a spirit of good&#xD;
-everywhere a blessing, a universal benefactor. Nor would&#xD;
he consent to enjoy comforts more than those around him.&#xD;
Taking up apartments with his staff in a little room in the&#xD;
tower of the church of La Cruz, which commanded a view of&#xD;
the enemy's camp, he seemed more than human in his powers&#xD;
of endurance, and the extent of self-abnegation.&#xD;
It had reached the first of May, and still-still Marquez&#xD;
did not come; but instead came the astounding intelligence,&#xD;
that, after procuring the re-enforcements and leavmg the capital&#xD;
to return, he had, by virtue of his power Lugar Yeniente (Lieu-&#xD;
tenant-General) acted upon his own discretion, and had, carried&#xD;
the forces to the relief of Puebla,. which was at this time be-&#xD;
sieged by General Diaz, leaving the Emperor at Querataro to&#xD;
get on without him. Had this movement been successful, his&#xD;
undue arrogance of authority might have been pardoned, as&#xD;
Puebla might have lent aid to Querataro; but as it ended in&#xD;
the fall of Puebla and the utter rout of Marquez's command, it&#xD;
only left the condition of Querataro. more. .hopeless. And&#xD;
matters there were indeed growing desperate. 'With no hope&#xD;
of relief or assistance now from any quarter, there was nothing&#xD;
left for the Emperor but to. arm the citizens; and this seemed&#xD;
a forlorn resort.S&#xD;
The Liberals, still some thirty thousand strong, lay off to the&#xD;
north-west, in their camps, quietly waiting; waiting yet work-&#xD;
ing, working as the mole, who burrows at your feet and under-&#xD;
mines you where you stand. Burnishing the- steel of the bay.&#xD;
onet through the day, and knowing that it was the chinking of&#xD;
gold at night, in a traitor's ear, that should give them adis-&#xD;
graceful victory.heai&#xD;
A cloudy, darksome night, full of chilliness and gloom!&#xD;

&#xD;
All along the hills that encircled the city hung a heavy cur-&#xD;
tain of mist; and beyond, dull and heavy, sounded the drums&#xD;
in the Liberal camp, beating the long-roll.. Hurriedly the list&#xD;
is run over by the officers; and each man answering to his&#xD;
name, the tattoo separates them for' the night. They go, each&#xD;
soldier to his rude pallet, with naught 'to shut out the pen-&#xD;
etrating mist save the piece of canvas, with which he is con-&#xD;
tent; and.before an hour has gone by, all things earthly are the&#xD;
same to him, -forgotten in that mutual friend of high and&#xD;
low, rich and poor, -sleep, blessed sleep1!&#xD;
" Spirits black and white !"  A strange array there was in&#xD;
those Liberal camps, pledged to defend the banner of the&#xD;
Republic; yet a union, perhaps, differing not much from the&#xD;
make-up of every army.&#xD;
Men, doubtless there were, sleeping there, who believed it to&#xD;
be the patriot's fire that warmed their hearts; -men who be-&#xD;
lieved it their duty to God, to oppose the institution of mon-&#xD;
archy, and who therefore cried out for a Republic, even though&#xD;
it kept their country forever deluged in blood:- and beside&#xD;
them, men, who, believing themselves patriots, fought for the&#xD;
shadow of Liberty, and saw not they were rejecting the sub-&#xD;
stance,-beside them slept, perhaps, a thousand adventurers,&#xD;
having no home no countryy.&#xD;
"Outcasts of all foreign lands,&#xD;
Unclaimed by town or tribe, to whom belongs&#xD;
Nothing except the universal sun ;-".&#xD;
men that love the sound of drum and fife -that have nothing to&#xD;
make life dear; that care naught for the soft peace march; for&#xD;
the green garlands and flowery wreaths woven by tender hands&#xD;
with which to greet the home-returning soldier; -men that&#xD;
fight for excitement, not peace ; who love the furious onset, the&#xD;
shock of battle, because there the restless current of life within.&#xD;
them finds vent in full force ; and if they can .but forget them-&#xD;
selves what matters it whose country is sacrificed, whose home&#xD;
is desolated, whose blood is spilled !&#xD;
But now, since the lights are all'out among the men, and silence&#xD;
keeps watch with them, we may steal into that large tent that&#xD;
is planted to the left apart from the 'others, and see why-it is&#xD;
that darkness reigns not there ; for the light burning, still beams&#xD;
out into the mist.&#xD;
Within, around the. little table on which is spread out a&#xD;
map of the city of Querataro, are' gathered. -some standing,&#xD;
others seated-the. officers who command this Liberal army,&#xD;
&#xD;

who fight for Benito Juarez .and the Republic. Thei-e is&#xD;
Palacio, Corona, Veliz, Garza, and other faces that are strange;&#xD;
but there, - there - sitting beside General Escobedo in citi-&#xD;
zen's dress -it cannot be! have we not seen him before in&#xD;
the council of the Emperor Maximhan ?    Oh! would that&#xD;
Joubert's friendly voice, or brave Khevenihuller's penetrating&#xD;
glance could be cast here to-night, that they might cry out&#xD;
so loud as to wake echo around, 'MiguelJopez! what dost&#xD;
thou here?"&#xD;
"And so the Emperor has heard at last what detained his&#xD;
trusty Marquez!" exclaimed General Escobedo, the command-&#xD;
ing officer. "Ha ! ha ! what a marvel of discipline that Impe-&#xD;
rial army must be! How much, think you, the head o%one of&#xD;
these Generals here, would be worth under similar circum-&#xD;
stances ? Would you give a hundred reals for yours, Veliz?&#xD;
But I guess the point with those in the city there is to save&#xD;
their own heads -every man for himself; and the good Emperor&#xD;
would give a good deal for his own in a few days, if we mistake&#xD;
not; eh ! Colonel Lopez?  But enough of this ! You say,&#xD;
since Maximilian has heard of Marquez's defeat, he has given&#xD;
.orders that three thousand of the citizens are to be armed.&#xD;
Well, in the first place, 'he will, from all accounts, find it hard&#xD;
work to find arms for them; and in the second, he might as well&#xD;
put guns in the paws of so many rats, for the good they'lls do&#xD;
him. Heaven help the place that must trust to its citizens&#xD;
for its defence ! But again,--- we will get off the track, -think&#xD;
-yo~u, Colonel Lopez, that the city can be held ten days longer'?&#xD;
Already, we hear, they, are enjoying horse-flesh; think you&#xD;
tat dainty fare will last them a fortnight more ? Come,&#xD;
come! .lhe contined, as Colonel Lopez seemed to hesitate and&#xD;
glance at the officers around, "you need fear nothing here; we&#xD;
al understand this matter ; now is the time for confidence,&#xD;
mutual and unreserved. Y-ou come into our camp undisturbed,&#xD;
and go away with all the knowledge you. please to gather; and&#xD;
now you must give us a favor in return."&#xD;
" Gentlemen! .said Colonel Lopez, turning himself 'to the&#xD;
'officers, and seeming not altogether pleased with Escobedo's&#xD;
freedom of manner and speech, - "gentlemen ! " he continued&#xD;
gavely, "you, whom I have not met before, doubtless wonder&#xD;
in your heart at my presence here to-night, and, perhaps, are&#xD;

Then, turn   to his officers: "These are your friends. Come,&#xD;
give us your hand, Colonel Lopez, and talk to us freely as&#xD;
brother to brother, for such in heart we are. d  i&#xD;
Escobedo himself set the example, and extended his hand&#xD;
warmly across to the new-made comrade. Was it accidentor&#xD;
chance,' that, while the others followed, General Ecerley&#xD;
turned aside, and walking 'to the front of the tent, looked&#xD;
out, absently.  As it was, the action was unnoticed; and&#xD;
when he came back to the little table, the officers were again&#xD;
bending over the map.&#xD;
"Do you think, Colonel Lopez," began General Escobedo,&#xD;
who again took the itiative,-  do you think Maximilian can&#xD;
hold out ten days longer? and  not     ih n  to ste&#xD;
his programme ? Does he intend then to show fight, or to take&#xD;
French leave of us?"&#xD;
A"If I were to hazard an opinion concerning the plans of&#xD;
Archduke Maximilian," said Colonel Lopez, slowly measuring&#xD;
his words, "I should say that Querataro will be evacuated.'&#xD;
"Hazard an opinion!" exclaimed Escobedohathardly inow&#xD;
  him, animatedly. "My good Colonel, t '      nfair,&#xD;
to be so close and niggardly with .your words, after ou unde-&#xD;
standing a few moments since, particularly when we all azard te&#xD;
strong personal ties between Maximilian and yourself. Hazar&#xD;
an opinion ! that is hardly plain enough for soldiers.Do'&#xD;
&#xD;
haggle with us; ", and leaning over, he whispered a few words&#xD;
into his ear, which, if'heard aright, might have been, " We have&#xD;
never haggled over terms with you," but which, whatever they&#xD;
were, caused a flush to overspread Lopez's face, as he answered&#xD;
quickly and shortly, --&#xD;
" Ah ! well, - Querataro, then, is to be evacuated."&#xD;
"But when?   In the coming ten days, think you?  Yes?&#xD;
then we can fall to work in earnest. Colonel Lopez has agreed&#xD;
with me before, gentlemen, to give us the entree of the city,&#xD;
through a break in the wall here," marking the point on the&#xD;
map. "The posts of the city in his command are to be given&#xD;
up to the regiments that enter first ; and while the Imperial-&#xD;
ists sleep and dream away the night, we shall give them not a&#xD;
very pleasant awakening. Quite a grand checkmate to the Em-&#xD;
pire, is it not ? "&#xD;
The commander turned with a triumphant laugh, half-sup-&#xD;
pressed, to his officers ; and each, as they heard for the first.&#xD;
time the cunningly devised plan, revealed in their counte-&#xD;
nances, the feeling with which the knowledge was received in&#xD;
their hearts.&#xD;
" What ? what, General Escobedo'? "cried General Echegary,&#xD;
suddenly stopping his walk beside the officer. "And is this&#xD;
the fighting, this the victory you have promised to your sol-&#xD;
idiers? Are we to take advantage of this -" he scarcely .&#xD;
checked himself from "treachery," in time for another word&#xD;
and finding none to fill its pl&amp;amp;ce, omitted it altogether.&#xD;
"Though our enemy, the Archduke Maximilian is a brave man&#xD;
and for God's sake, let us meet him in the open field, and give&#xD;
him fair fight, as.one brave man should another ! Surely we&#xD;
need have no fear of the end, when he has only nine thousand&#xD;
men, and we thirty. Let us not take advantage of this -&#xD;
let us not steal upon them as a thief in the night. It will be&#xD;
forever a stain upon our banner, to plant it on high thus. The&#xD;
world will never honor such a cause: let us attack the city, to-&#xD;
morrow - when you will; we are all ready--but do us jus-&#xD;
tice; let us win our victory openly and fairly!"&#xD;
"Ah, Echegary, Echegary," exclaimed the General, shaking&#xD;
his head, "you are a brave soldier, and will fight to the&#xD;
death; .but you don't quite understand that important part of&#xD;

So come, come ! content yourself to fall in with our .ideas !&#xD;
Doubtless we could quite annihilate Maximilian and his whole&#xD;

way. Besides, it is not his army, but himself, we wantto put&#xD;
out of the way. For take him off, and I warrant you, in a&#xD;
week, nine tenths of them will shout as loudly for the Republic&#xD;
as they ever did for the Empire. So hush up your pious scru-&#xD;

"cOnly one word before you proceed, General," said Eche.&#xD;
gary. "You know, as a soldier, I must obey all orders you&#xD;
may see fit to give me, now, or in the future; but I beg to have&#xD;
nothing to do with this planning. Permit me to retire."&#xD;
"Well, go, then ! and bad luck attend you!" exclaimed&#xD;
Escobedo, half petulantly, as Echegary left the tent.&#xD;
" But," interrupted Lopez, anxiously, while a smile stole&#xD;
over the faces of those around, "can you trust that man? will&#xD;
he not betray us ?&#xD;
"Trust him ! trust him! " echoed the officers.&#xD;
" No fear of Echegary," continued Corona; "he is blunt and&#xD;
peculiar, but he is as true as steel. He may not work with us&#xD;
now, but he'll never work against us."&#xD;
Through the mist and dampness, over the valley along the&#xD;
hillside, echoing lingeringly, comes, from the city the solemn&#xD;
tolling of the midnight bells.&#xD;
" Ah ! is it so late?" said Colonel Lopez, starting up.&#xD;
" Twelve? I must be in by one o'clock ; so we must say au re-&#xD;

shoulder; "let us understand each other. You will be on the&#xD;
outside of the wall on the night, in question, and will yourself&#xD;
conduct the regiment you may find waiting. In the meantime,&#xD;
keep us advised ; and for the other part of our agreement, you&#xD;
hold a sure claim on us for that;" and again he leaned over, and&#xD;
whispered to Lopez, while the others were preparing to depart;&#xD;
again whispered the something that brought the flush to his&#xD;
face. -.&#xD;
" Here, Colonel Garza, conduct Colonel Lopez beyond the&#xD;
guard. One word more, and then good-night. Maximilian&#xD;
&#xD;
and his staff lodge at present in the tower of La Cruz Church,&#xD;
and take observations therefrom? Veliz, see that you send a&#xD;
shell there with friendly greeting, the first thing after drill to-&#xD;
morrow, and 'continue the compliment 'from time to time, dur-&#xD;
ing the day. Good-night, Colonel Lopez! Heaven's blessing&#xD;
attend you !"&#xD;
Heaven's blessing attend Lopez, the traitor ! Heaven's bless-&#xD;
-ing attend Judas, 'who hath sold his Master for thirty pieces of&#xD;
silver! Heaven's blessing attend the hypocrite.who, to-night,&#xD;
hast taken the patriot's name in vain ! God, who rules over&#xD;
heaven and earth, forbid ! forbid !&#xD;
What is it, who is it, that attends that solitary figure hur-&#xD;
rying over the misty plain?  What spirit is it ? Can it be&#xD;
only a wavy shadow, that, floating above him in mid-air, holds&#xD;
the sword of Vengeance already drawn, above his head, and&#xD;
keeping pace with him, however fast he goes, whispers with a&#xD;
thousand voices, " Lopez, the traitor ! the traitor! "&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE sun, of the Empire was indeed setting ; sinking&#xD;
forever behind the hills of Time. All industrial and&#xD;
prosperous pursuits had long ago been checked. Long&#xD;
ago, the villages of the emigrants-that had given such&#xD;
promise of growth, falling beyond the line of Imperial protec-&#xD;
tion, as the forces were concentrated nearer the interior, had&#xD;
been deserted, and the emigrants gone elsewhere to seek the&#xD;
home of peace which Mexico could not give them.  All other&#xD;
enterprises,:national or private, were  bed in the great life&#xD;
and death struggle of the Empire, which had now well-nigh&#xD;
reached its crisis. The star of the Republic had been gradually&#xD;
rising in the horizon, for months past. Juarez held all the&#xD;
northern provinces; and one by one, the cities of the interior&#xD;

&#xD;
had fallen into his hands ; and now since Puebla was gone, there&#xD;
was only Querataro and the capital left.&#xD;
And Querataro, where the last desperate stand was to&#xD;
have been made, - it, too, was to be given up ! General&#xD;
Marquez had struck the Empire a fatal blow when he deprived&#xD;
the Emperor of the re-enforcements from Mexico City. With&#xD;
those, the army at Querataro might have given battle to Esco-&#xD;
bedo, and won the day. With this success, he could have again&#xD;
rallied, and perhaps gathered an army sufficient to cope with&#xD;
Juarez. -As it was, the Emperor Maximilian was too consci-&#xD;
entious to sacrifice his whole army, by either making or stand-&#xD;
img an attack.  Provisions, too, had grown so scarce, that the&#xD;
troops must fall back towards the capital to obtain subsistence;&#xD;
and so the evacuation was determined upon. General Meija was&#xD;
to be left with twelve hundred armed citizens to cover the re-&#xD;
treat, with orders to surrender at his discretion, after giving the&#xD;
army twenty-four hours' advantage. One thing after another&#xD;
delayed the evacuation, until, at last, the night of the 14th of&#xD;
May was decided upon for the movement.&#xD;
Slowly the day-god sank down beneath a cloudless horizon,&#xD;
and as twilight came and went, one after another the stars&#xD;
crept out, and sent their timid beams down upon the cactus-&#xD;
lined hillside ; while high above all, in mid-heaven, in majestic&#xD;
calmness, shone the quiet moon, sailing through. a sea of blue&#xD;
ether.&#xD;
In the city of Querataro, the soft beams descend on no scene&#xD;
strange or new. From the corridors overlooking the court-&#xD;
yards, comes the sound of merry laughter, telling that the jest&#xD;
and banter go round the social circle just the same. Through&#xD;
the open windows, the passers-by catch the soft, notes of the lute&#xD;
and the guitar, following thedeep, mellow tones that troll out&#xD;
some rich old Spanish melody ; and on the Plaza, promenading&#xD;
in the moonlight under the 'orange-trees, are the whispering&#xD;
lovers, that dream not of a time to come.&#xD;
An hour' passes; one - two - three, and the night grows&#xD;
on. Court-yards and corridors are silent; the windows are&#xD;
closed, and the latest lingerer waits in vain .to catch another&#xD;
note. The' Plaza and the orange-trees, too, are deserted.&#xD;
The' people have gone to rest. Rest, rest ! ye who can! and&#xD;
dream not of the morrow !&#xD;
Throughout the whole city shines no light save the little oil-&#xD;
lamp that flickers and -flares- up now and then in there tower&#xD;
of the Church La Cruz. The dim, indistinct mistiness, the&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
t&#xD;
Y&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
ghostly shadows that creep up now and then upon the walls&#xD;
serve rather to make the darkness visible there, than to dis-&#xD;
pel. it.&#xD;
In'that little apartment there is no rest. Gathered in anx-&#xD;
ious consultation, are the commanders of the. Imperial army,&#xD;
the Emperor in their midst.  There is General Castillo, long&#xD;
ago returned from his hapless nussion with the Empress Car-&#xD;
lotta; and now since diplomacy is no longer required, serving&#xD;
the Empire in the field. There is the lion-hearted Meija,&#xD;
ready to die at his young Emperor's command ; Miramon, the&#xD;
ex-President of the Republic, to whom these scenes of changing&#xD;
governments' are nothing new; there is Prince. Salm-Salm,&#xD;
a German officer, who has but recently joined his Majesty in&#xD;
Mexico, yet ranking high upon his staff; there is Count Iso-&#xD;
lani, always trusted, and always faithful; and there, by the&#xD;
Emperor's side, just as we saw him seven nights since, by.Esco-&#xD;
bedo's, is Colonel Miguel Lopez, alas ! likewise, always trusted.&#xD;
This was, each felt in their heart, though none spake out,&#xD;
perhaps, the last council they should ever hold together over&#xD;
the interests of the Empire, and a spirit of solemnity ,and awe&#xD;
akin to that which haunts the death-chambers of earth, seemed&#xD;
to hover near.&#xD;
The lights had long been extinguished in the camps, and&#xD;
the men were resting on their, arms, gathering strength for&#xD;
the march that was to begin before the day dawning ; and the&#xD;
generals had assembled together in the Emperor's room  to re-&#xD;
ceive the last orders.&#xD;
Sternly and determinedly, though hopelessly, each one looked&#xD;
into the face of the other. They knew that their cause was&#xD;
almost gone ; that this move was a last desperate chance; only&#xD;
a lengthening out as .it were, of suspense. A miracle might&#xD;
save them, human agency scarcely could; and yet, were they&#xD;
determined to fight as long as their noble Emperor would lead&#xD;
them, and though there was no hope of success, they would. die&#xD;
like brave men should. Pride and despair sat haughtily upon&#xD;
each brow, and each resolved that the world should know that&#xD;
they .were true to the end.&#xD;
The last orders were given; the hour for marching was&#xD;
named, and one by one, with a warm grasp of their Emperor's&#xD;
hand, and a fervent "Heaven speed us ! " the officers went&#xD;
down the steep narrow steps that led up to the tower, into the&#xD;
vestibule of the church, out into the quiet streets; where, sepa-.&#xD;
rating, each took his way to his own quarters.&#xD;

Colonel Lopez lingered with the Emperor, when the others&#xD;
were gone. He had always been accustomed to share much of&#xD;
the Emperor's confidence ; and of late, since the coming to&#xD;
Querataro, Maximilian's heart had been opened more to him&#xD;
than ever before. To-night, left thus alone, the two were soon_&#xD;
together on the Plaza, in front of the church.&#xD;
"YourMajesty, perhaps, had best say good-night here, and&#xD;
go up again to sleep for the few hours that are left. You will&#xD;
feel the need of repose to-morrow."&#xD;
" Sleep has forsaken my eyes;" exclaimed 'the Emperor,&#xD;
"and repose, I know not the word. If you are not too&#xD;
much fatigued, Lopez, come, let us take a turn across the Plaza,&#xD;
here; all seems so quiet, we are not likely to be disturbed."&#xD;
Ah ! Lopez, Lopez!" continued the Emperor, mournfully,&#xD;
as the two walked slowly, arm in arm, across the pavement,&#xD;
that it has come to this- to this.! I could weep tears of blood&#xD;
that our cause has come this to last strait. If it were only as in&#xD;
those olden days, when God gave not the battle to the strong,&#xD;
nor the race to the swift! "-- and, as if half-forgetting that he&#xD;
was not alone, he murmured aloud those beautiful stanzas on&#xD;
the destruction of Sennacherib:&#xD;
'Like the leaves of the forest, when summer is green,&#xD;
That host with their banners, at sunset was seen;-'&#xD;
Like the leaves of the forest, when the autumn hath blown,&#xD;
That host on the morrow, lay withered and strewn.&#xD;
For the angel of death spread his wings on the blast,&#xD;
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;&#xD;
And the eyes of the sleepers wax'd deadly and chill,&#xD;
And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still.'&#xD;
Ah! Lopez, my friend, if that angel would but breathe&#xD;
not into the face of friend or foe, but into this face that these-&#xD;
eyes might grow heavy and chill ! And it is to be so! The&#xD;
voices that proclaim in due season the fates of men, already&#xD;
ave whispered mine.to me; they have never before been false&#xD;
prophets, and they will not fail me now; th4y whisper but one&#xD;
word -- dah"&#xD;
"et Wh.&#xD;
What, wlat ! my Emperor,? " exclaimed Lopez, "such&#xD;
despair, such despair? It wrings my heart to see you doubting,&#xD;
when so many stand brave and true beside you."&#xD;
"Despair ? not despair, Lopez ! weariness - weariness with&#xD;
struggling, with living, were better names. My country-&#xD;
for Mexico is my country ; I belonged to her when first I&#xD;
touced 1ese shores -my country gone --my wife -Carlotta,&#xD;
my beautiful, peerless wife !" and his voice, though choked&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JEWELa.&#xD;
&#xD;
'with rising tears, sounded tenderly and softly, as he whis-&#xD;
pered her name. " Ah ! there was the cruel blow, that stabbed&#xD;
hope --life -all- to the heart! What should I care for&#xD;
success, since she may not share the triumphs.?  The defeat,&#xD;
thank God, she may not grieve for that ! "&#xD;
"Defeat, your Majesty ? I beseech you, trust that it will&#xD;
not be so. We' are not yet defeated; we may yet make a&#xD;
stand beYond Querataro; we may yet drive Escobedo back.:&#xD;
the darkest hour only heralds the dawn. You, -you, our&#xD;
Emperor, must sustain us; you must uphold us; the men must&#xD;
see your'eye bright, that theirs be not dimmed; your voice&#xD;
must be firm, that theirs may not falter."&#xD;
"You are right, my true, trusty, friend ! Your words. come&#xD;
with strength to my soul," cried the Emperor, suddenly rally-&#xD;
ing his failing energies. " This has been a moment of weak-&#xD;
ness, of the heart's unburdening; and we shall be stronger on the&#xD;
morrow for it. Even the stoutest need these relief periods,&#xD;
when the billows bear them on too fast. And to whom would&#xD;
I sooner give the " Open Sesame " to the hidden chambers in&#xD;
the heart's cave beneath the sea, than to you?  Thank God,&#xD;
that, with allmy woes, He blessed me with faithful friends."&#xD;
For a whilethe two walked together in silence ; and then&#xD;
Maximilian spoke again.&#xD;
" Lopez, while we are. alone, let me speak freely to you.&#xD;
Saving Isolani, I know no one dearer. I shall go away from&#xD;
Mexico.- to -to -Miramar -:- Austria - heaven, perhaps.&#xD;
I feel the spirit of coming events, and we all see their shadows.&#xD;
You will remain. Your home will be here in Mexico. When the&#xD;
Empire is dead and gone, and the people far and near, even my&#xD;
people, cry out, "Viva Ia R6pubhique" nay, if you, yourself&#xD;
should grow republicanized, forget not the Emperor of Mexico.&#xD;
Separate the cause from the man; and when some wild ran-&#xD;
cheros, in a patriotic hour, may curse the Empire, forbid him&#xD;
the Emperor's name. Compel him to .hold that. sacred; and&#xD;
tell him that the Emperor loved Mexico better than his own&#xD;
life, and would have died freely and willingly to have'given her&#xD;
peace."&#xD;
" I  republicanized, your Majesty?" exclaimed.Lopez, with&#xD;
well-feigned disgust.  "Whatever may be the changes that&#xD;
sweep this land, I trust Lopez will stand firm;. this heart will&#xD;
never grow cold to the name of the Emperor Maximilian, whose&#xD;
friendship has been one -of the blessings of its life."&#xD;
"Yes, we love to call up your acts of devotion; would that~&#xD;

we might reward, and repay them all fifty-fold! And there is&#xD;
your son, our little godchild ; are we so ill off, that we have&#xD;
no gift for him ? Ah ! we shall see that he is remembered.&#xD;
A bright-eyed boy he must be now. I see him,. as he was,&#xD;
when we all stood before the bishop. in the Cathedral, and he&#xD;
lay'in your arms. Do you remember how gleefully the little&#xD;
cherub laughed with delight and threw up his arms, when the&#xD;
holy water fell on its face ? Forget not, as he grows up, to&#xD;
teach him the names of his godfather and godmother. But away&#xD;
with these tender memories," exclaimed Maximilian; " they&#xD;
make a child of me ! Well ! I have done now, and to-morrow,&#xD;
'Richard will be himself again.' See ! it lacks of twelve, does&#xD;
it not? the moon is high above us, and here we are at the door&#xD;
of the vestibule. Isolani and Salm-Salm, who lodge with me,&#xD;
are doubtless wondering if I have deserted them. I saw them&#xD;
go in when we were across the Plaza, some time ago. Well, we&#xD;
part here; go, rest till three ! and then action - action -ac-&#xD;
tion ! Heaven bless you, Lopez!"&#xD;
Did not those words of blessing burn and hiss in the traitor's&#xD;
heart, the last his injured friend and Emperor ever spoke to&#xD;
him?&#xD;
And dost thou dare, 0 Lopez ! by calling out an answering&#xD;
"Heaven bless you ! " summon Heaven to witness the foul,&#xD;
blackening lie, the wicked lie, that this night thou hast been&#xD;
thinking, acting, speaking?&#xD;
The Emperor passed in and closed the door of the vestibule.&#xD;
For some moments, Lopez stood in silence ; and the moon&#xD;
shone down upon his face, pallid axed white. Ah ! Conscience,&#xD;
Conscience is not yet dead! and now, to-night, she lifts her&#xD;
voice, to her murderer : " Could he betray him, the friend&#xD;
that trusted him, and opened to him his innermost heart?&#xD;
The man that was godfather to his first-born, - could he sell&#xD;
him-- and for gold, sordid, paltry,-corrupting gold ? How true&#xD;
had he been to him with his tongue, how false in his heart !&#xD;
Could he not yet turn back? there was one hour yet, be-&#xD;
fore the last step was taken, before the seal was fixed, And that&#xD;
one hour might save him from the climax of his evil deed." Oh !&#xD;
that he had heard this voice, months and months ago ! then,&#xD;
then, if he had only cast out the devil from his heart ! but now,&#xD;
now it was too late ! A hundred voices could proclaim already&#xD;
the lengths to which he had gone. Already, perhaps, Esco-&#xD;
bedo's regiments waited beyond the wall ; and then there was the&#xD;

low.  Clutching that thought to his heart, he turned into a&#xD;
side street, and the Plaza was deserted.&#xD;
Gone, gone, gone to his evil work, while his victims sleep.!&#xD;
A quiet night it is ! The song of the night-bird ,sounds&#xD;
fainter, and more faintly still, from the valley. Now the sweet&#xD;
notes are hushed. Far away - away, has the singer flown&#xD;
to the greenwood's depth. See ! how the moonbeams rest upon&#xD;
the orange-trees, and how broad the shadow of the old Cathe-&#xD;
dral lies out upon the Plaza. Lay your hand upon your heart&#xD;
in this magic stillness. Does the life-pulse still beat ? do the&#xD;
wheels of Time move on?&#xD;
Dong !&#xD;
One -by the bells !&#xD;
Again, silence. An intense, maddening, fatal silence. Is&#xD;
there not one voice that can,-that will, -break the spell,&#xD;
and cry out, with a shout that shall rouse the sleeping hills&#xD;
themselves, "Awake ! awake ! Treason stalks abroad !""&#xD;
Hush !  Was it a footstep?    Another -another - and&#xD;
another. How many ? They cannot be counted.. Tramp -&#xD;
tramp -tramping, on they.come toward the Plaza.&#xD;
Hark !  To the left there must be others; for there too&#xD;
sounds the tramp -tramp --tramp of soldiers' feet. 'The moon&#xD;
has hid her face behind the clouds; and as they come up across&#xD;
the Plaza, we cannot see whether it be friend or foe that comes&#xD;
ungreeted and unexpected. Will no one waken -ah ! there -is&#xD;
the voice of a sentry crying out, "Marquez - Marquez has&#xD;
come to help us ! "&#xD;
That shout has roused the multitude. A thousand doors open&#xD;
wide ; a thousand glad voices echo, "Marquez has come ! God&#xD;
be praised ! God be praised!"  The bells from every tower&#xD;
catch the refrain, and with trumpet voices in wild, mad joy,&#xD;
tumultuously swell the exultant cry.&#xD;
But listen ; there is -a shriek ! Are the Imperial soldiers&#xD;
wild, that they rush at the sound of that voice, from their tents,&#xD;
like madmen. Oh, God ! they hear those fatal words again,&#xD;
ringing out,&#xD;
" We are betrayed, betrayed ! the enemy is in our midst ! "&#xD;
The clouds have gone, and the moon comes out upon a&#xD;
scene of mad confusion - of hurrying to and fro - of com-&#xD;
mands given and revoked in the same breath;. of hastily&#xD;
formed battalions; squadrons that rush hither and thither,&#xD;
seeking the enemy they know not where. Now they have&#xD;
met, and face the foe; there is the clashing of swords, the&#xD;

&#xD;
sound of guns, the shriek of the wounded, the' groan of the&#xD;
dying; and the voice of Meija rises above the' din,&#xD;
" Die -Mexicans, die like brave men! Beat them back!"&#xD;
While this goes on in the left .of 'the city, 'where is the&#xD;
Emperor?   What has befallen La Cruz?&#xD;
Already the officers, -Salm-Salm, Isolani, and Castillo,&#xD;
sleeping near the Emperor in the Convent, are awakened; and&#xD;
hearing the cries and tumult without, the firing of guns, and&#xD;
ringing of bells, rush in to rouse the Emperor. In a moment&#xD;
they guess the truth. They stop not to ask whose deed it is;&#xD;
but only whispering, "We are betrayed]!" throwwide the lit-&#xD;
tle window overlooking the Plaza. Already they hear the&#xD;
sound of footsteps there ; and, oh?! wretched sight ! there is a&#xD;
body of the enemy's infantry turning, this moment, into the&#xD;
square."&#xD;
"Now, now ! " exclaimed Isolani to the Emperor, hurriedly,&#xD;
-" now is our time! We may escape wh le they are forming,&#xD;
before they place their sentinels!"&#xD;
The four rush down the staircase ; they swing back the door,&#xD;
and are upon the pavement --not unperceived. An officer,&#xD;
standing but ten steps off, rushes forward, and while the bat-&#xD;
talion is forming, gives the command, "Halt!"&#xD;
The Emperor and his officers take no heed, and again the cry,&#xD;
" Halt ! halt!"&#xD;
Count isolani, who is behind, seeing that all will be lost,&#xD;
as the officer is now joined' by a score of men, and is advancing&#xD;
upon .them, whispers to Salm-Salm, "On with the Emperor!"&#xD;
and turning, with drawn sword, confronts the Liberal officer&#xD;
and his men.                                        -  -&#xD;
Only a moment he thinks ; he must stop them here, if only a&#xD;
second, to give the others time. With a loud cry in German,&#xD;
(hoping to pass as the Emperor), he rushes on the officer.&#xD;
There are ten to one; and a moment later he-is left with as&#xD;
many wounds, bleeding - dying, perhaps -upon the stone&#xD;
pavement.&#xD;
That moment has-given the Emperor and his officers, who&#xD;
do not notice that Isolani is behind and- does not join them&#xD;
again, time to escape. They hurry on, through the narrow&#xD;
streets, which the enemy have not yet reached, in the direction&#xD;
of the Empress's.Guard, Lopez's Regiment; meeting only now&#xD;
and then a flying cavalry man, who stops to beg the Emperor&#xD;
to take his horse and escape ; and who tells that~ Miramon is&#xD;
&#xD;
wounded and captured; .that Mendez, too, is a prisoner, and&#xD;
that all the posts in the west of the city are in General Corona's&#xD;
possession.&#xD;
They reach the camp of the Imperial escort, and there for&#xD;
the first time -the Emperor hears from -his own men, the name&#xD;
of the traitor. Stunned and overcome by the intelligence, the&#xD;
Emperor, hearing too that General Meija had succeeded in es-&#xD;
caping to a hill, El Cerro de las Campanas, just without the&#xD;
city, with a considerable force, and had- left orders that all&#xD;
shall join him there who can, moves towards him with his&#xD;
escort,&#xD;
The morning dawned; and with the first rays of light Max-&#xD;
imilian and his officers look down upon the lines of thb enemy,&#xD;
for already, are they formed to give them battle.&#xD;
"General Meija, can we break those lines with our little&#xD;
band ? " exclaimed the Emperor, earnestly, turning to the old&#xD;
warrior.&#xD;
Just then two batteries began to play upon them from the&#xD;
Liberal forces, and in the roaring of shot and shell Maximilian&#xD;
could just catch the noble answer, -&#xD;
"Sire, it it impossible ; but if your Majesty orders it, we&#xD;
will try it ; for my part I am ready to die."&#xD;
A deadly pallor overspread the Emperor's face. He gasped&#xD;
for breath; but in an instant a firmness cast his features in&#xD;
an iron mould; and he turned to General Castillo :&#xD;
" We must not lose, then, another moment, -- nor another&#xD;
life ! . Quick ! there, General, a white flag upon the hill-top to&#xD;
stop their fire. My God ! how much we would give' now for a&#xD;
shell to end the matter with us!"&#xD;
The firing ceased. A wild, triumphant shout ran along the&#xD;
Liberal lines, as they saw the, signal from the hill. Their last&#xD;
battle had been fought, and the victory was with them.&#xD;
In another hour, two officers of the Emperor were holding&#xD;
an interview with General Escobedo, offering; in the name ofi&#xD;
his Majesty, Maximilian, to surrender on conditions that the&#xD;
Emperor demanded. First,- that if General Escobedo desired&#xD;
another victim, to take himself, the Emperor; second,-he wished&#xD;
that the men of his army should be treated with all the consid-&#xD;
eration that' their loyalty 'and valor merited ; 'and:third, that&#xD;
he and the men of his, personal service' should bes treated as&#xD;
prisoners of war.&#xD;

and when the evening calm fell on the earth again, Maximilian&#xD;

CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
3 INCE the Emperor's coming to Querataro, Anita and&#xD;
Jnez had made no change in their mode of living;&#xD;
and though repeatedly urged by friends to come to the&#xD;
city for protection, they felt quite safe at their own&#xD;
home; for though on the suburbs, they were sufficiently re-&#xD;
moved from the camp to be out of the enemy's power ; and so,&#xD;
in spite of persuasions, they remained at home.&#xD;
They kept up with the military movements, from the daily&#xD;
journals, and knew that affairs were approaching a crisis; yet&#xD;
they were not prepared for the terrible midnight awakening,&#xD;
nor the fearful intelligence which Pedro brought an hour later,&#xD;
that "the city was in the hands of the enemy ; that Colonel&#xD;
Lopezhad betrayed the Emperor; that his Majesty had escaped&#xD;
with a small force to El Cerro de las Campanas ; that there had&#xD;
been some hard fighting in the city, and the streets in some&#xD;
places. were strewn with the deadand wounded men."&#xD;
Anita and Inez waited not for the dawn to rise and attire&#xD;
themselves; but hastening their toilet, were soon together&#xD;
below stairs, where they sat by the window-side, watching for&#xD;
the coming of the day, whispering in suppressed accents their&#xD;
grief and sorrow.       _ -&#xD;
" Ah, well, Inez," said Alita, at last, as the long hours&#xD;
drew to a close, and the rosy flush that heralds Aurora s car&#xD;
stole over the face of the gray sky ; "it's all over now with&#xD;
the Empire ! But a poor, weak triumph the Liberals have,&#xD;
-a shaming victory they have won. Don't grieve so, child;&#xD;
they haven't-taken the Emperor, and he can go back to-Ger--&#xD;
many."                                           ..&#xD;
""No, no, Aita," replied Inez, sorrowfully and despairingly,&#xD;
as the tears stood in her eyes; "they will have the Emperor,&#xD;

and treachery will finish its work ! That Lopez- Colonel&#xD;
Lopez - upon whom the Emperor has lavished, has heaped up&#xD;
favors, should have done this; it cannot, cannot be possible 1"&#xD;
An hour later, when the mocking sun had risen, old Pedro&#xD;
came in from the city, where curiosity or anxiety, perhaps, had&#xD;
led him as soon as it was safe to venture out.&#xD;
" Ah, senorita ! senorita ! " he exclaimed, as he entered the&#xD;
sitting-room, bringing the fresh water for the morning, "a sad,&#xD;
pitiful sight it is, and it sickens my heart to look upon it. A&#xD;
sentinel, grim and fierce, with his polished bayonet confronting&#xD;
one at every turn; the city alive with the soldiers of the ene-&#xD;
my on foot, on horseback, dashing hither and thither ; and all&#xD;
along on the pavement, in the streets, our poor Imperial sol-&#xD;
diers ; some dead as the stone on which they lie, and others&#xD;
groaning with the pain of their wounds."&#xD;
" But surely, Pedro, they are not leaving them there to die,&#xD;
when some perhaps, might, be saved ! " exclaimed Inez, her&#xD;
face pale, and terror-stricken. Did she think that perhaps&#xD;
among them there might be one dear to her heart?&#xD;
"No, no, senorita ; the good Fathers and some of the people&#xD;
are out; and when I left they were moving them into the con-&#xD;
vents, where the Sisters will do all they can for them."&#xD;
"But oh ! they are so many, and the Sisters so few.. Anita&#xD;
we must go at once-at once, and help them. We cannot sit&#xD;
here idle in the face of so much suffering. I cannot stay an&#xD;
hour longer, when I feel weare so much needed. Pedro!"&#xD;
she called, as the old man closed the door behind him, "have&#xD;
you heard aught more of the Emperor," as he reappeared:&#xD;
"is he safe ? "&#xD;
"Yes, senorita; his Majesty, and the generals, and a good&#xD;
many of their men are over on the hill; but they say they&#xD;
can't make a fight, and they can't get away; so the trouble's&#xD;
not over yet. But poor, poor General Mendez ! he was cap-&#xD;
tured, as he charged with his men a company of the enemy in&#xD;
the street leading into the Plaza; and the order has been given&#xD;
for him to be shot this morning."&#xD;
" 0 -God! '" exclaimed Anita, covering her face with her&#xD;
hands, 4and it is thus they will treat the Emperor. God keep&#xD;
him from their hands!"&#xD;
Afita and Inez entered the little court of the Convent to.&#xD;
gether ; and as they turned to one side, and up on the corridor,&#xD;
Sister 'T;h6rese crossed the hail at which they stood. She&#xD;

stopped an instant and beckoned them to come in. As they&#xD;
reached er side near the door of a little cell, she whispered&#xD;
hurriedly,&#xD;
"We  .re quite crowded with the wounded. They have just&#xD;
carried one in here,"pointing to the cell. "An Austrian officer,&#xD;
I think. Let me 'see, what was his name -Count Iso-"&#xD;
Inez's heart bounded, and then, in a moment, was still.&#xD;
She had moved a step forward, and was looking in through the&#xD;
low doorway.,l&#xD;
Throughthe little end window, with its quaint-cut, vertical&#xD;
panethe sun sent in a quiver of golden beams, and gleefully&#xD;
the shafts dancedwith the shadows of the leaves of the elm that&#xD;
grew just without, foriga mazy whirl upon the stone floor.&#xD;
In te crner, was a low couch, and thereon, one in the uni-&#xD;
frof anImperial officer. Stars glittered upon his breast,&#xD;
forand the belt and sword, unclapsed, had fallen by his side. A&#xD;
profusion of dark brown, matted hair lay out upon the pillow,&#xD;
She fac noble, open, and handsome, was white and pallid,&#xD;
like unto death.&#xD;
He lay there alone; dead, she thought. She did not heed&#xD;
tHa    he and Sister Th6rese had looked into that little cham-&#xD;
that edid o    ear the latter whisper, "Poor fellow! there&#xD;
ps  .hoe for him; he was wounded on the Plaza, they&#xD;
say." n She did not note that Aflita had drawn the Sister away,&#xD;
and   e    left there alone. No, no! Time had but one&#xD;
hour, the world but one spot to her. Victories and defeats,&#xD;
were all alike, all one, to that maiden standing face to face with&#xD;
weeath, hiding in his grasp the one she loved' better than her&#xD;
owDe heg oneshe had never, with, all her striving and&#xD;
oayng been able to shut out from her heart.&#xD;
prShe   een and knelt by the loW bed. One moment her&#xD;
She went in annth  face and then like a stricken one, she&#xD;
ees re uponfloor. That glance: had opened the flood-gates&#xD;
of her u  n    he tide so long pent up came rushing over her&#xD;
no   h seu,  watr t ofh  puo  devoted, unselfish  love, now  so&#xD;
nol woefully intermingled ,with those of grief and agony.&#xD;
She might love him now; she might shed those bitter, bitter&#xD;
ea nmi ovain! forihe was to be taken from her; was going,&#xD;
t perhaps - already gone. All her love, and all her weeping&#xD;
could not hold him back from death. This was the last et-&#xD;
in;the last parting was not far off. ,Ah, 'Duty, Duty ! take&#xD;
i;th ha nowromher heart; se hath served thee faithfully;&#xD;
she hath been th handiaiden through a dreary time; she hath&#xD;
&#xD;
kept her vow, her word, within these last months, when she&#xD;
had but to lift her voice and bid thee depart that Happiness&#xD;
might come in thy place ; deny her not these hours of respite -&#xD;
give her soul now its freedom !&#xD;
An hour passed ; and Anita stole softly in, as women are wont&#xD;
to do into chambers of death, and leaning over the wounded&#xD;
man, was silent a moment, and then whispered to Inez,-&#xD;
"Inez, my child, he still breathes, and will perhaps revive&#xD;
again.. Stay, and watch beside him to-day."&#xD;
She went out, but soon came in again with wine and a basin&#xD;
of water, and whispering to Inez that she must bathe his brow,&#xD;
and, if he roused up,, wet his lips with the wine, left them to-&#xD;
gether alone.&#xD;
The day passed on, the noontide, came and went, and the&#xD;
shadows of the leaves on the the stone floor grew to mammoth&#xD;
size, aad seemed crowding each other away.&#xD;
For hours Inez sat by the little couch, chafing the hand of the&#xD;
unconscious one in hers, moistening the parched lips, damping&#xD;
the heavy locks that grew upon the brow, and striving, if pos-&#xD;
sible, to bring back the breath of life ; wondering, too, the&#xD;
while, if the spirit was to take its flight without, one adieu.&#xD;
That thought steeped her soul in agony. " This -was the end -&#xD;
the end! .He was to go away ; and she was to be left behind.&#xD;
- That heart that had beat so strongly, so truly, s~o constantly&#xD;
for her, would soon be stilled, and the clods of the valley,&#xD;
would rest upon his breast.! Oh, if he would rouse up for&#xD;
one moment-- one moment-- that she might whisper to'him&#xD;
of the'love which she had borne him; that he might know the&#xD;
fullness of that love -that she might tell him all, - so that&#xD;
he could take in the fullness of her suffering also.&#xD;
It was past noon when Sister Therese looked in, and asked&#xD;
if there was aught she could do; and Inez whispered,-&#xD;
"I will watch beside him -he is a friend, -you know-"&#xD;
She could say no more, for her tears choked out her voice. It&#xD;
needed not Anita's word of explanation in the morning, nor&#xD;
Inez's timid effort now, to tell the gentle "Sister "how things&#xD;
were; and as she turned away, she glanced with pitying tender-&#xD;
ness into the girl's grief-stricken face, and then, as if moved&#xD;
by a sudden impulse, stole'to her side again,and pressing her&#xD;
to her heart, whispered,&#xD;
" My child, God help you ! " and then went out.&#xD;
Was he breathing more freely now?  That breath seemed&#xD;
longer and fuller. 'Inez leant over to distinguish if possible&#xD;

&#xD;
the first spark of returning consciousness or life. As she&#xD;
bent her face quite close to his, there was a slight motion of&#xD;
the hand; the eyes opened, and looked up to. hers; strangely&#xD;
and wonderingly at first, and then a great wave of joy rolling&#xD;
up from the happiness and love that flooded his soul, for a mo-&#xD;
ment obscured the light that shone in those windows.&#xD;
"Inez, - you here ?  By my side, -my own - now ! Oh!&#xD;
thank God for this hour ! thank God that He has sent you to&#xD;
me here. I knew it all along.; I knew that there should be some-&#xD;
reward even in this life to this poor heart for all its sacrifice&#xD;
and self-denial; and this is it ! It has come !"&#xD;
He caught her hands in both of his, and drew her towards&#xD;
him, closer, closer -till she heard again those precious words&#xD;
that he seemed to love, to whisper, -" Mine own, now mine&#xD;
own!"&#xD;
Faintly and weakly they came; but strong enough they were,&#xD;
to lift up the flood-gates in the woman's heart, and let loose the&#xD;
deep waters pent-up there.so long. And though she had no&#xD;
power to give.him answer, the tear-drops that fell upon his&#xD;
breast thick and fast were sweeter far, because a surer messenger&#xD;
of the love he believed in, than a thousand crowding words.&#xD;
"Look up, Inez, and let me see your face ; speak to me, that&#xD;
I may hear your voice; aye, the old words that have rung a&#xD;
ceaseless chant in my heart since we have been parted, -' Victor&#xD;
Isolani, may God bless you!' Speak to me now, Inez; you&#xD;
know what I want to hear, - that it is the love of the man, not&#xD;
purely the love of God, that has brought you here, and will keep&#xD;
you with me to the end. When I was strong, and there was&#xD;
power in this poor arm, -power in the heart to suffer and to&#xD;
endure -then it was right, perhaps; I did not question it,&#xD;
though the vow that stood between us has been hung about&#xD;
with the mystery that veils Giulian's death,--then, it was right&#xD;
that you should say me, 'nay;' but now, it is a weak, dying&#xD;
man, done with all things in earth-life save this earth-lorve that&#xD;
pleads, as he plead at Giulian's. grave, for the .sound of your&#xD;
voice, lovingly calling his name!"&#xD;
"Victor, Victor Isolani," she cried, as she bent her head by&#xD;
his side, "'God only knows how I\ love thee! look into the&#xD;
unworthy heart -read there what you will! Oh heart! " she&#xD;
murmured, "confess all -all to him now!"&#xD;
Aye, the time for confession has come; let her speak now,&#xD;
for, soon her voice cannot reach him, and all her wailing&#xD;
and crying against~ the broad blue heaven will not rise higher&#xD;
&#xD;
or nearer to him than the "song of the lark in her singing"&#xD;
Let her speak now. She will keep back from him nothing in&#xD;
this last sacred hour. He shall know that even while Giulian's&#xD;
betrothed; her heart had' wandered to him; shall know that&#xD;
she had striven with that love, as with an evil spirit ; that she&#xD;
).ad fasted, had wept, had prayed over it; and though perhaps&#xD;
not conquering altogether, God had given her strength to do her&#xD;
duty. And he shall know that when Giulian's death, coming&#xD;
simply as death, would have left her free, coming as "murder"&#xD;
on her account, by a brother's hand,.it had bound her soul in a&#xD;
penance that naught but death could end. He shall know;&#xD;
why, loving him better than all else save duty, she had put&#xD;
him back, - put her own heart, her own happiness, in abey-&#xD;
ance, because that stern Druidical Guide had bidden her. Yes,&#xD;
she would tell him all; and perhaps he would bear the record&#xD;
with him to that other land, and would lay it' at the Father's&#xD;
feet, and for the sake of the Saviour, whose seal she trusted it&#xD;
bore, it would mayhap be held sufficient to blot out the mortal&#xD;
sin set to her account in that Great Book wherein all human&#xD;
names are written.&#xD;
Tremblingly and softly at first she began; but forgetting her-.&#xD;
self as she looked into his face; her voice grew stronger, and&#xD;
she went on, unto the end. Victor Isolani listened in silence ;&#xD;
and when she finished, and he understood all that had stood&#xD;
between them,-understood that it was the blood-stained&#xD;
hand of a wicked brother, that lifted itself between the sister&#xD;
and happiness -when he knew fully all, his soul swelled with&#xD;
a devotion to her so unmixed with earthliness, that it was&#xD;
worthy to be laid at the shrine of a Sainted Madonna.&#xD;
" Inez," he said solemnly, as if oppressed and almost silenced&#xD;
by the thoughts that followed her voice. "I am not worthy,&#xD;
save through suffering like unto your own, to touch the hem of&#xD;
your garment. Already the diamonds that shall shine in&#xD;
your heavenly crown are burnished and glittering; and among&#xD;
those that shine brighest there, oh God! place the saving of&#xD;
Victor Isolani's soul! Saved, saved - through love ! It was&#xD;
your hand, Inez, that, while denying' the gift for which I&#xD;
plead, pointed me heavenward ; showed me the path which you&#xD;
have trod, and bade me look from the bleeding Christ on the&#xD;
cross, to the sparkling diadem  in heaven. Inez, the hand&#xD;
that dealt me these blows, there on the Plaza, in the midnight&#xD;
'hour -though the' hand of the enemy, I trust did me good&#xD;
service; it unlocked the prison-door; and when the soul goes&#xD;

forth, it shall be, to. enter as a royal monarch, crowned, the&#xD;
Kingdom   above. And the Emperor - God grant that he&#xD;
escaped! I strove to give them time. I shall not see his face&#xD;
again; but go to him if you can, Inez; tell him from me, from&#xD;
Victor Isolani9 that though our cause is lost, though friends&#xD;
betray here,"- for, Inez in her speaking, had told him of Lopez's&#xD;
treachery,  "tell him, in life or in death, to strive for that&#xD;
imperishable crown, whose diamonds shall not fall away."&#xD;
]Re was exhausted with much speaking, and lay there now in&#xD;
silence, in that breathless, feeling silence that concentrates&#xD;
years past and years to come, sometimes, ii one moment.&#xD;
The day was well-nigh spent; but Inez had taken no note of&#xD;
time. No other day in all her life seemed like this. She had&#xD;
forgotten the Empire, forgotten the Emperor almost, except&#xD;
when the offi er had brought him to mind.. Though at noon-&#xD;
time there had been shouting and crying without, when the&#xD;
Emperor came into the 'city a prisoner, it all passed un-&#xD;
heeded to her. On the marrow the whole weight would come&#xD;
upon her. She only listened now to the voice of the one&#xD;
beside her, when he _spoke again, telling her of the midnight&#xD;
waking, of that scene upon the Plaza, all confusion, when he&#xD;
strove to give the Emperor time to escape; and before he could&#xD;
follow he was on the pavement, left by, the enemy as dead.&#xD;
Whose Samaritan hand had brought him here he knew not;&#xD;
for when he knew aught again, she was with him. "My&#xD;
last day is gone !" he exclaimed as the last golden ray faded&#xD;
softly from the casement ; " where shall I be at the dawn'?"&#xD;
"Sleep now," whispered Inez, "and believe -that all shall&#xD;
be well."&#xD;
"All shall be well!  Soul! soul,! " he murmured,-&#xD;
"'Death comes to set thee free,&#xD;
Oh meet him cheerily&#xD;
As thy true friend! '"&#xD;
He closed his eyes, and there was quiet in the little cell. Is&#xD;
he sleeping?  Aye, see the smile that plays about the full lips,&#xD;
and rests upon the noble face ! But now, only a moment&#xD;
has. gone by, and the smile too is gone. He throws up his&#xD;
arms restlessly, and mutters incoherently. Inez bent her ear&#xD;
close to.his face, and she caught the half-formed sentence, " Your&#xD;
brother did it ! your brother, Inez ?"  And she knew that his&#xD;
mind dwelt on that bold, bare truth that had stamped itself so&#xD;
deeply on her life and his. His mind wanders. He hears agaii&#xD;
&#xD;
the midnight din, and cries out, "My God ! we are betrayed;&#xD;
the enemy is upon us ! Save the Emperor ! save the Emperor !"&#xD;
The purple lips are quiet, and then they whisper softly, "The&#xD;
Tyrol ! Inez, my home - the Tyrol! "&#xD;
And so with Inez, listening and weeping, an hour goes by,&#xD;
and more. The day is quite dead, and the moonbeams steal in&#xD;
through the diamonc panes softly and tenderly, and rest quietly&#xD;
on the stone floor, as though, in sympathy with the grief-stricken&#xD;
watcher, they had given up the- evening's glee. And they&#xD;
know too, perhaps, that they stand in another presence; know&#xD;
that Death has grown weary of waiting without, and stands&#xD;
now, grim and gaunt, on the other side of the couch.&#xD;
He has touched him with his bony hand, chilly and damp.&#xD;
He wakens; and forgetting himself, starts up suddenly.&#xD;
"Where am I? What is this darkness ? Ah ! " with a&#xD;
groan of pain that brings back the truth, "this - is the Valley&#xD;
and the Shadow! " and he fell back heavily upon the pillow. p&#xD;
"Inez, are you here?" he said, reaching out for her hand. I&#xD;
cannot see you; come nearer; put your face close to mine. I&#xD;
am going, Inez, going now; the end has come! Bury this&#xD;
poor body here at Querataro, where you can sometimes place a&#xD;
flower above it ; no atter, if that vacant place at the old vault&#xD;
at the Tyrol is never filled: we are but dust. If I could but&#xD;
see your face again ! The sun has gone, and why do the moon-&#xD;
beams delay their coming so long ! No, no ! the moonbeams&#xD;
have come already, have they not ? and Death stands between&#xD;
us. Here, --put your hand on my heart --poor muffled drum,&#xD;
tired out, it beats softly and slow-too slow to keep pace with&#xD;
the footsteps of Time that is leaving it behind."&#xD;
He placed his arms about her now; as she leant over him, he&#xD;
drew her face to his, and their lips met in a kiss that he should&#xD;
bear with him into eternity.&#xD;
" Mine - mine," he whispered brokenly, "up there ! "&#xD;
"Up there ! " was echoed softly.&#xD;
The white-winged Angel has descended, and hovers above&#xD;
them. She waves her golden 'sceptre, and the weary eyelids&#xD;
close -- close to earth-scenes of toil and strife, close to suffer-&#xD;
ing and sorrow, and waken to the glories of -the Eternal King-&#xD;
dom. Ah! Spectre gaunt and grim, take the heap of dust, the&#xD;
poor cold body ; Victor Isolani hath done with it forever; his&#xD;
soul goes with the Angel to put on that garment of incorrup..&#xD;
tion immortal in the skies.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
HE world was holding high carnival at Paris. The&#xD;
Emperor of the' French had not yielded himself so&#xD;
I .dthecre f d.&#xD;
much, during the years just passed, to the cares o d&#xD;
lomacy and State that he had forgotten to provide his&#xD;
restless people with something to absorb their minds, and at the&#xD;
same time to establish himself as theChief Royal Patron of&#xD;
Art, Science, and Industry. After another fashion, he had fol-&#xD;
loWed the example of his illustrious Bonaparte ancestor. He&#xD;
had gilded the dome of the " Hotel- des Invalides for the peo-&#xD;
ple to look at, and at the same time builded =in Arc de&#xD;
Triornphe" for himself.&#xD;
Napoleon III. had sent abroad to all the world, to every&#xD;
nation, " Greeting," and had bid them come to Paris with what-&#xD;
ever works of art they could' boast ; with whatever triumphs&#xD;
in any industrial department of mechanics, they had achieved,&#xD;
and enter the lists-for the prize. The rude Olympic festivals&#xD;
of the ancient Greeks were to be revived, and to be given a&#xD;
loftier, higher tone., "The Exposition Imperial" of 1867 was&#xD;
to eclipse all others that had preceded it; was to be the grand&#xD;
event of the decade of years stretching between 60 and 70.&#xD;
For months before the first of May, which was to be the grand&#xD;
opening day of the Exposition, the Field of Mars resounded with&#xD;
life and activity. Every nation h d responded to the Royal in-&#xD;
vitation, and had sent workmen and artists to execute their&#xD;
part of the Tower of Babel, which was to be built at Paris.&#xD;
The " Palais de l'industrie," as the temple in which the Exhibi-&#xD;
tion was to be held, was called, was begun. The part of the&#xD;
plan which was to be given to each nation, was. apportioned tt&#xD;
were seen the Rue d'Autricho tecRue de Belgique, Rue deo&#xD;
&#xD;
Russe, etc., etc., crossing each other within the edifice, and or-&#xD;
namented with pillars, arches, and embellishnients after the&#xD;
style of architecture of -each country ; while here and there&#xD;
immense fountains were placed, dividing the different compart-&#xD;
ments. The Champ de Mars was changed, as if by the magic&#xD;
of Aladdin's Lamp.&#xD;
Champ de Mars /  The name calls up the changes that have&#xD;
passed over that Park ! The mind runs back to the time&#xD;
when " Louis, the Well Beloved," established there, the splen-&#xD;
did Ecole Militaire, where five hundred indigent young men&#xD;
were educated at the public expense ; and he hoped to make it&#xD;
the Alma Mater of French marshals, where patriotism and&#xD;
courage should alike be nurtured: but after Louis' day the&#xD;
Ecole declined, and the beautiful- situation became simply' a&#xD;
mancouvring field for the Parisian soldiery, and received its&#xD;
name, Champ de Mars. In later years, during the mad rev-&#xD;
olution of 1789, when the streets of Paris flowed with the blood&#xD;
of innocent citizens, it was from this slope that the Parisian&#xD;
commanders watched the scenes. Again, when the storm lulled&#xD;
for a while, and the new Constitution was to be -signed by the&#xD;
hapless King, it was here that, with wild enthusiasm at the&#xD;
thought of their triumph, the meniand women rushed to aid in&#xD;
the building of the grand Amphitheatre that was -to be the&#xD;
place of the solemn ceremony of the King, the members of the&#xD;
Assembly, and LaFayette, in behalf of the National Guards&#xD;
taking oath. The confederation was formed; but. it did not save&#xD;
Louis the Sixteenth from the' scaffold. , Another year, and&#xD;
the same voices that cried to them on that day, " Long live the&#xD;
King ! Long live Queen Marie Antoinette ! " hooted and&#xD;
hissed at the "Austrian Woman !"" at "Louis Capet ! "as they&#xD;
passed to their bloody death.&#xD;
The Champ de Mars -is eloquent, with history, -not alto-&#xD;
gether to France's credit; but that is past, and set long ago to&#xD;
the national account. Now, in the spring-time of '67, no one&#xD;
thinks of thesethings ; and the lively French men and women&#xD;
who come out to see the. progress of the Palace from day to&#xD;
day, forget that Fnce ever had ,a Revolution; forget, too,&#xD;
perhaps, that she e  r had. so great a ruler before as Napoleon&#xD;
The first of May, --the great opening day, -came. The&#xD;
Palace was ready; and the works of art of each nation were&#xD;
displayed in their own compartment. The judges had been&#xD;
appointed by the Emperor ; and the visitors from all parts of&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
the world crowded Paris. But a dash had come, which damped,&#xD;
perhaps for three -days, - possibly longer, - the anticipated.&#xD;
pleasure. It came through the American telegram, that the&#xD;
Empire of Mexico had fallen; that the Emperor Maximilian,&#xD;
whose name they had heard so oft in these later years, had&#xD;
been sold by one. of his own generals to the Liberal army&#xD;
at Querataro; and that he was there now a prisoner, await-&#xD;
ing whatever fate they might decree.&#xD;
But this was not enough, however unfortunate and mal cpro-&#xD;
pos, to interrupt the round of Paris pleasures in which all&#xD;
Europe participated. The Royal Heads would satisfy their&#xD;
hearts, and Napoleon would satisfy his conscience bj'sending a&#xD;
protest to Juarez in Mexico, by offering a ransom sufficient to&#xD;
buy the whole of Mexico-; by pledges guaranteed without limit&#xD;
for the future, if the Emperor Maximilian be'released: this&#xD;
done, "let the dance go on! "&#xD;
The Czar of, Russia left the domes of St. Petersburg in the&#xD;
distance, and journeyed over his frozen steppes to behold the&#xD;
modern temple that vied with Solomon's, and in which his na-&#xD;
tion held a niche. The Sultan of Turkey, too, came, to compare&#xD;
the splendors of Paris with the mosques and minarets of his&#xD;
own Byzantine City. The young Prince of Wales came up for&#xD;
England ; and the beauty and the chivalry of all the Continent&#xD;
was gathered there.&#xD;
Right royally the Emperor of France received and enter-&#xD;
tained his guests. There were yet lacking the King of Bel-&#xD;
gium and the Emperor of Austria, to fill up the royal circle:&#xD;
but they were to come later, when the summer deepened ; and&#xD;
perhaps the Emperor of Mexico would come with them,&#xD;
again only Archduke of Austria.&#xD;
" Joy was unconfined." Pride reigned in the heart of each&#xD;
monarch, as they went from room to room, in the Palace ; for&#xD;
as they passed dn they could see, that if they had failed in this&#xD;
invention, they had triumphed in that production. Each&#xD;
would bear a prize away. Never had Paris been gayer. Never&#xD;
had the Champ Elysses, the Bois de Boulogne, and the Boule-&#xD;
vards, seen a greater throng; never had the hearts of the people,&#xD;
always touched through pride and the senses, beat more warmly&#xD;
towards their Emperor, who had prepared for them this great,&#xD;
glorious diversion, -this fete "pour passer le temps," than&#xD;
at this period.&#xD;
But another messenger comes, and bids them stop and listen:&#xD;
" The Emperor Maximilian has beentried by court-martial&#xD;
&#xD;
at Querataro, and found worthy of death. Sentenced to be&#xD;
shot until dead, on the 19 h of June."&#xD;
"Helas IMalheureuse /" "Send, oh ! our Emperor ! send&#xD;
another protest, a petition, a memorial-anything that will&#xD;
save his life."  It is done: the petition bearing a score of Royal&#xD;
names is sent; and again, at Paris, "Pleasure reigns!"&#xD;
.                     .    .    .         0&#xD;
" The Convent of the Capuchinas, in Querataro, is an an-&#xD;
cient, spacious building, all over whic the hand of Time has&#xD;
drawn its dingy strokes; and as you  e at its exterior, ob-&#xD;
serving its dimensions, its domes, its statuary and carvings,&#xD;
you are reminded that the pile of silver and gold that reared&#xD;
this massive temple, could be enclosed in no small compass.&#xD;
Year. after year, mite after mite was contributed by rich and&#xD;
poor, to raise its lofty dome toward the heavens, beneath&#xD;
which the ever-faithful daily gathered to offer up, on bended&#xD;
knee, thanks to their Maker, for the many blessings they had re-&#xD;
ceived. Those who gave their mite, those who laid stone upon&#xD;
stone upward -upward rising to the sky,. little thought that&#xD;
they were walling in their descendants, for sustaining political&#xD;
opinions honestly formed and conscientiously advocated. * They&#xD;
never dreamed that they were erecting a warrior's abode, a de-&#xD;
pository for, bristling bayonets, polished swords, powder and&#xD;
balls, where the bugle, the fife, and the drum were to sum-&#xD;
mon the inmates to service;-where the armed sentinel paces to&#xD;
and fro with a measured tread. These workmen reared that&#xD;
costly structure for a house of peace, where the multitude,&#xD;
armed with the word of God only, were to be taught, "Ven-&#xD;
gence is mine, saith Lord."&#xD;
.But, as the sunlight of the dying afternoon in June fell upon&#xD;
it, the stillness was broken-by the ceaseless tramp of the armed&#xD;
sentinel, who trod back and forth, in front of the huge portal,&#xD;
ever watchful of -those who now and then came in, and passed&#xD;
out.&#xD;
Look up at the high-towering, massive pile ! Within those&#xD;
walls is one who does not go out nor come in at his own&#xD;
bidding;- one, proud, noble, just and free; upon whose name&#xD;
they have set the seal of death, and who, they say--those mur-&#xD;
derers of Liberty- shall come- out no more, save to go to that&#xD;
death.&#xD;
It was but too true : the telegram that startled Europe, with&#xD;
the announcement of the Emperor Maximilian's trial and sen-&#xD;
tence, and coming execution, was not merely toying with&#xD;

&#xD;
their fears; the Emperor Maximilian had indeed been tried,&#xD;
before a mock court of justice, before a court-martial of the&#xD;
generals of Escobedo's appointing, and had been condemned,&#xD;
as he had been in their hearts, from the day of his capture,&#xD;
to be shot, as a usurper of the rights of the Mexican people.&#xD;
Everything, all arrangements of the trial had been left to Gen.&#xD;
eral Escobedo, whose declared motto had long been known,&#xD;
"Death to foreigners!" And so the Emperor of Mexico was&#xD;
condemned to die. The protest of the crowned heads of Europe&#xD;
only provoked a smile of contempt from the Indian warrior.&#xD;
What, if the Queen of England- said, that it was- "a near&#xD;
and dear relative for whom England plead "?  So much the&#xD;
more triumph for Mexico. What if the Emperor of Austria&#xD;
prayed for the life of a brother well beloved ?, What, if he&#xD;
assured them, the Archduke Maximilian would leave Mexico&#xD;
forever -would be restored to all his former rights in Austria?&#xD;
No, no ! Austria and her Archduke must be taught a lesson.&#xD;
Mexico must vindicate her rights ; must triumph completely ;&#xD;
must be satisfied' this could alone be done, by the shedding of&#xD;
the Emperor Maximilian's blood.&#xD;
And so time went on, and the 14th of June had arrived.&#xD;
In a small room in the second story of the old Convent, with&#xD;
only a door opening into the corridor that overlooked the&#xD;
court-yard, and one window looking into this corridor, sat&#xD;
the Emperor Maximilian; not alone, for the officers of his&#xD;
staff, who were confined in the same prison, were permitted to&#xD;
visit. him; and this afternoon Prince Salm-Salm sat by the&#xD;
little pine table in the centre, which, saving an iron bed-&#xD;
stead and a few chairs, was the only article of furniture in the&#xD;
room. Without, on the corridor, walk'.g backward and for-&#xD;
ward before the window, and never pass g it without turning&#xD;
his eyes in upon the prisoners, was the guard, with his shining&#xD;
bayonet always ready. Across the court, on a corridor opposite,&#xD;
at the head of the stairs which led up, another guard kept&#xD;
up his pace likewise; so there, under those two watchful eyes,&#xD;
wakeful as the dragon that. guarded the fabled fruit in the gar-&#xD;
den of old, sat the Emperor and his officer. A single word in&#xD;
their own loved German was forbidden, iest some interchange of&#xD;
thought might pass that the rude Mexican soldier might lose;&#xD;
and so, each preferring that eye-language, which ofttimes speaks&#xD;
more fully, mope eloquently than words, they sat in silence,&#xD;
each intently regarding the other.&#xD;
The Emperor leant his arm upon the table, resting his head&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the hand that was raised. But little changed since we&#xD;
saw him last upon the Plaza, within the city, saving a calm,&#xD;
quiet look, that perhaps the hopeless always wear, had taken the&#xD;
place of that burning enthusiasm, that had then lit .up his eyes.&#xD;
He sat there looking calmly at Prince Salm-Salm, looking and&#xD;
thinking, -thinking of the Prince's life. A scion of one of the&#xD;
noblest German houses, young, brave, and daring, he had, come&#xD;
to the United States some years since ; had found there " God's&#xD;
best gift "to man; and later, had come with that wife to the Mex-&#xD;
ican Court. He had followed him in every-movement ; had stood&#xD;
by his side in the storm of battle at Querataro, had yielded him-&#xD;
self a prisoner with him, and was now here by his side;&#xD;
while his wife, stronger, truer than ever, as women are wont&#xD;
to be in the trial hours of life, had gone to throw herself at&#xD;
Juarez' feet, to bese  te President for pardon, -for respite&#xD;
- for delay-  anyl.t1t would keep the Emperor in life;&#xD;
and this afternoon her return was expected. Maximilian did&#xD;
not grow impatient for her coming, for he knew that life now&#xD;
was not for him: he only went on thinking and dreaming, -&#xD;
thinking of his wife ; what she. had done for him, what she had&#xD;
been to him; and he turned aside his face from the Prince, and,&#xD;
as he brushed away a tear, thanked God that the full weight of&#xD;
this blow would not come upon her at once. And. then he&#xD;
thought of the Prince again, as he turned his face towards him.&#xD;
Would they kill him too? would they honor him too with a&#xD;
mock trial and a Mexican grave?  As yet the "Powers that&#xD;
be" had not considered him'; God grant they might spare him!&#xD;
And there was Court Khevenihuiller shut up with the brave&#xD;
Hussars in Mexico City, besieged by a Liberal force sent there,&#xD;
to take the capital; what would be his fate? Ah ! if he had but&#xD;
heeded when he had warned him; he saw now all the train of&#xD;
duplicity of the traitor heart; saw how he had led him on to&#xD;
give him his confidence ; had deceived him, even when he had&#xD;
already sold him to the enemy; saw it all, yet did not curse&#xD;
him; in his noble heart there was but one thought, "Let him&#xD;
be forgiven."  And Isolani! dead ! In life they had been to-&#xD;
gether, and in death they would not be separated. Isolani had&#xD;
given his life to save him! Brave, noble spirit ! he was beyond&#xD;
all recompense of earth-love now; doubtless 'in heaven he had&#xD;
received his reward. While these thoughts passed in and out&#xD;
through the -Emperor's mind, his companion, the Prince, was&#xD;
thinking too; but he saw above' that unnloved figure a presence&#xD;
of light hovering ?road lhim, and upon~ her heavenly brow&#xD;

&#xD;
crowned with radiant. stars, he marked the shining word'&#xD;
"Hope ! "  And he did hope; -hoped that his Sovereign and&#xD;
himself would soon quit these gloomy walls - quit this land of&#xD;
terror, and tread again their native shores; - hoped, through&#xD;
faith in his wife, that her mission would not fail ; that the&#xD;
Republican President at San Luis Potosi would grant pardon&#xD;
to all ; would not lose the opportunity of showing himself a&#xD;
great man. But -if- she should fail!&#xD;
There was desperation, despair, in the thought: he must drive&#xD;
it away; and, so suddenly, that he startled the Emperor, he&#xD;
exclaimed in Spanish, -&#xD;
" La Senora tarries ! "&#xD;
"No, Prince," said Maximilian, calmly; "it is you who are&#xD;
impatient. This is not a place to hasten the march of time.&#xD;
They play only the dead march to enliywus here," he added,&#xD;
with an attempt at pleasantry.&#xD;
" Ahi! we shall leave their solemn marches before long; how&#xD;
welcome will be our Ranz de J7che in the Tyrol, or Strauss in&#xD;
Vienna ! "&#xD;
The sentinel, attracted by the sound of their voices, had come&#xD;
to the window and stopped for a moment, then turned his face&#xD;
toward the court, and placed himself so as to lose nothing of the&#xD;
conversation within. As the Prince's last words fell on his ear&#xD;
he turned quickly and gave him a searching glance, that said so&#xD;
plainly that the Prince answered it, "Do they think to escape ?"&#xD;
" Juarez must listen to the Princess; and then Escobedo&#xD;
cannot keep us ; Austria will make terms with Mexico, if we&#xD;
can only gain a week, until her ambassador may arrive."&#xD;
*     Maximilian quitted his seat, that he might not damp the&#xD;
Prince's hopeful spirit, and walked to and fro the length of the&#xD;
apartment. His.footsteps sounded out upon the brick floor&#xD;
and, annoyed by the continued presence of the guard, who still&#xD;
remained at the window, the two lapsed into silence again.&#xD;
Prince Salm-Salm, taking up the pen, and pulling the writing&#xD;
material which lay upon the table nearer to him, commenced to&#xD;
write, while the Emperor kept up his promenade.&#xD;
It was growing quite late ; the sunlight had gone, and the&#xD;
dusk was gathering in the court-yard. There were no sounds&#xD;
to be heard save the barking of a dog in the street below, and&#xD;
the echo of the soldiers' voices.- Only a few moments, and&#xD;
there is a voice in the court-yard, and footsteps are heard com-&#xD;
ing along the corridor. .Prince Salin threw down his pen and&#xD;
&#xD;
reached the window just in time to see that it was his wife com-&#xD;
ing towards their door.&#xD;
Unable to control himself, in an agony of hope and fear,&#xD;
which in a moment would be decided, he turned quickly from&#xD;
the window, and exclaiming, "She has come at last !" threw him-&#xD;
self in the chair he had vacated, afraid to hear the tidings she&#xD;
had brought.&#xD;
The key was turned, the door was thrown open, and the&#xD;
guard announced with mock ceremony, -.&#xD;
"La Seora !"&#xD;
The door was shut again, and for a moment the Princess&#xD;
Salm stood quite still, just within, her whole form trembling&#xD;
with agitation.&#xD;
The Emperor waited for the Prince to greet his wife. Prince&#xD;
Salm-Salm lifted his head from his hands; he looked up into&#xD;
her face. He read the answer there,-"'Despair ! there is no&#xD;
hope!"&#xD;
It needed not that she should place her hand in his ; that&#xD;
she should look hopelessly towards the Emperor, and then sink&#xD;
upon his breast, whispering, "Nothing -nothing ! I have done&#xD;
nothing! "&#xD;
The Emperor had drawn near, and as she leaned her head&#xD;
upon her husband's shoulder, exhausted with grief and fatigue,&#xD;
he laid his hand upon it, and in those same quiet tones, not&#xD;
one shadow less steady, he said, "Senora, may God bless you,&#xD;
and your husband, for you have both done all you can! Let&#xD;
the issue come; we can meet it ! "&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVII.&#xD;
AVE the Emperor ! save the Emperor ! "&#xD;
-   Only the unconscious murmurings of a dying man ;&#xD;
but when Victor Isolani had been coffined, with the&#xD;
- sword, that he had loved so well placed by his side --&#xD;
when he had rested in the solemn silence of the vaulted con-&#xD;
vent chapel, while the dark-robed "Sisters" and the deep-voiced&#xD;
priest chanted sacred masses for the repose of his soul,-when&#xD;
they, with another dark-robed mourner, whose grief was too&#xD;
deep for tears, whose sorrow. was too heavy for words, had laid&#xD;

&#xD;
him in a vacant niche in the vault, gloomy, and damp, of the Con.&#xD;
vent, and had shut out from him forever the light of day; when&#xD;
they had done all this, and Inez had turned away to follow Anita&#xD;
homeward, with a desolation of heart more dreary than all the&#xD;
desolation.she had known in the years past;- when she reached&#xD;
the "quiet home, and sat down in her own chamber to think,&#xD;
and brought home to herself the reality of the woe that had&#xD;
come, -not to herself alone, but to her poor country, - those&#xD;
words, "Save the Emperor ! ".of all the precious words that he&#xD;
had spoken, seemed to'stamp themselves upon her mind; seemed&#xD;
to stand out from the rest, as if they had power to command&#xD;
her soul.&#xD;
But as yet, the fate- of the Emperor had not been decided,&#xD;
and surely there was no evil in store for him. He would go&#xD;
to the Empress, and would leave Mexico to work out her own&#xD;
wretched destiny. There was nothing for Inez to do at present,&#xD;
save to see the Emperor, if that were permitted by those who&#xD;
held. him captive. She must bear to him the last message&#xD;
of his faithful friend.&#xD;
Day after day passed, and still Inez dreaded to break the&#xD;
sacred quiet which was so soothing to her wounded heart. If&#xD;
she saw the Emperor before he left for Europe, that would be&#xD;
enough.S&#xD;
Unhappily, the fate of theEmperor Maximilian was not left to&#xD;
the judgment of his faithful subjects; was not left to those who&#xD;
loved the Empire and its ruler. The question of life or death&#xD;
remained with General Escobedo, and to hope for clemency, nay,&#xD;
for justice, from him, in this matter, was vain indeed; and&#xD;
yet, though each heart was filled with fear, and doubt, and trem-&#xD;
bling, though they knew the character of the military court&#xD;
that sat in judgment, and before which the Emperor- Maximilian&#xD;
and Ge erals Miramon and Meija were trying, they were not&#xD;
altogether prepared for the end when it came, -could not take&#xD;
in and believe that their Emperor and the two generals were&#xD;
to be shot like criminals, within their hearing, in four days.&#xD;
The fatal day was but a few sunsrising off. Scarcely had,&#xD;
the first glimmering of -the dawn stolen over the hills, when-&#xD;
Jnez Gonzales left,. her pillow. Only the day before had the&#xD;
Emperor's death-fiat gone forth; and when the first shock of&#xD;
grief and indignation had passed, Inez had felt her woman's&#xD;
soul grow strong within her. Surely, if she could do aught to&#xD;
save hini, the time had come now; and there was not an hour&#xD;
to be lost. The night was long and dreary enough to Inez,&#xD;
&#xD;
who, sometimes. treading the length of her. little apartment,&#xD;
sometimes throwing herself across her couch, seeking to collect&#xD;
her thoughts, and shape the thousand fanciful ideas that flitted&#xD;
through her brain into something practicable, wore out the&#xD;
midnight hours. Again and again she asked herself, what&#xD;
could she do -she, a woman? What power had she to save&#xD;
the Emperor ? If they would only take her poor useless life&#xD;
instead, and let him live ; let him who ,was so strong to do&#xD;
good, to bless mankind, let him live, and let her die ! She&#xD;
could do that, if it were possible ! But as often as she clasped&#xD;
her hands across her brow, -as often as she sank in weakness&#xD;
upon her couch, those spirit-tones roused her again, "Save the&#xD;
Emperor !.save the Emperor ! "&#xD;
And when the gray dawn stole into her chamber, she rose up&#xD;
strong and brave; for the inspiration that filled, in days long gone,&#xD;
the soul of Joan of Orleans, that thrilled with noble patriotism&#xD;
and heroic devotion the maid of Saragossa, had breathed its&#xD;
spirit into her soul too; had called to her, "Rouse thee, Inez&#xD;
Gonzales ! rouse thee 1 "&#xD;
Inez had obeyed ; and her heart answered, t1lat she would do&#xD;
something -what she could, for the Emperor who had given&#xD;
-his all for Mexico.&#xD;
She knew that although Anita's heart might be with her in&#xD;
all she did, yet Anita had scarcely strength enough to support -&#xD;
her in any plan she undertook, where presence of mind and&#xD;
delicate tact was necessary ; and so she resolved that Anita&#xD;
should be her confidante, but Sister Th6rese at the Convent, a&#xD;
woman of quick perception, mature but tender judgment, her&#xD;
aid, in all she did.&#xD;
The sun had scarcely finished an hour. of his daily course,&#xD;
when Inez bid Anita " adieu," and, attended by Pedro, started&#xD;
for the city.. She had told Anitaher purpose and determination,&#xD;
and to her oft-repeated question, "But what can you do, Inez? "&#xD;
gave the same answer that she had given to her own heart;&#xD;
"Don'task me now, Aiita; I must do something; the Emperor&#xD;
must be saved, and why should not I help to save him?  Don't&#xD;
ask me, Aiiita, how; for I scarcely know   myself.  Only&#xD;
think, that I am with -Sister Therese; she will be with me in&#xD;
whatever I may do."    And with this Anita was satisfied;&#xD;
though, as Inez turned away, she shook her head mournfully,&#xD;
and sighed,&#xD;
" Ah, Inez! it will all be useless! you cannot save him from&#xD;
Escobedo!"&#xD;

&#xD;
It was but a short walk to the city, and the Convent was not&#xD;
far within. The air was fresh and cool, and Inez hurried over,&#xD;
the green plain so fast, that the faithful old Pedro, whose youth&#xD;
had departed long-ago, could scarcely keep pace with her. In&#xD;
vain he tried to attract the attention of his young mistress to&#xD;
the beauty of the far-away hills, or to the tiny daisies they trod&#xD;
down at every footprint, things that formerly, she had never&#xD;
passed without heeding; this morning, there was but one thing&#xD;
in Inez's mind, and so she hurried on faster each time that&#xD;
Pedro spoke.&#xD;
At last they reached the convent gates; and going in as the&#xD;
porter, who recognized Inez and always gave her ready admit.-&#xD;
tance, threw them open, entered the court-yard, where Pedro,&#xD;
quite exhausted, sank down under the shade of one of the small&#xD;
evergreens growing there, and between panting and puffing, as&#xD;
his young mistress passed up the stairs that led to the first cor-&#xD;
ridor, unburdened his heart in a mournful soliloquy.&#xD;
" Ah, Senorita Inez! " with a shake of the head and a long.&#xD;
breath; "she is not what she used be ! she never chats so light&#xD;
and free with old Pedro now! -It's nothing now but the Sisters&#xD;
and mass; she'had as well be a Sister herself at once, with her&#xD;
ghost look and her solemn eyes.. Ah ! that visit to the grand&#xD;
city, it never did her any good! But poor dear Senor Giulian's&#xD;
death was enough to cut her down." And Pedro seemed to&#xD;
reproach himself for entertaining an impatient thought, at&#xD;
aught that she did. With another shake of the head, he con-&#xD;
tinued his confidential talk with himself.&#xD;
"But everything's changed, - changed,  and changing, in&#xD;
this awful country, all the time. More than twenty years ago I&#xD;
,came from Spain with the senorita's father; and it's been war,&#xD;
-war, -war,-ever since I've been here. Mexicans can't stay&#xD;
satisfied ; I don't believe they ever could live in peace, not even&#xD;
in Heaven, because they can't fight and kill each other there !&#xD;
See how this beautiful young Prince left his own home and&#xD;
caine away over here, just to do them good and fix some laws&#xD;
for them ; and his young wife, as they say is so, beautiful, too,&#xD;
went crazy for them, - they are going to thank him by shooting&#xD;
him, like he had done them some gre4t harm ! Thank.God ! I&#xD;
am not one of 'em, for their time's got to come ! "&#xD;
With this fervent ejaculation, while drawing the worn-sleeve&#xD;
of his surtout across his eyes, Pedro picked himself up, and&#xD;
started homeward,. remembering that he was to return for Ineza&#xD;
in the afternoon. -&#xD;
&#xD;
In the meantime, Inez had passed along the corridor and&#xD;
turned into one of the narrow halls opening into it, and soon&#xD;
stood at the door of Sister Therese's little apartment. Her low&#xD;
knock was answered by the Sister herself, who welcomed her&#xD;
with a smile and a kiss.&#xD;
An hour later, and two nuns, in the dress of their order, went&#xD;
out together through the convent gate. One bore in her hand&#xD;
a covered basket, and the other carried a small prayer-book in&#xD;
the folds of her long veil. They went-up the Calle di  , at&#xD;
the end of which stood the Liberal sentinel. Passing him, they&#xD;
kept on until they reached the street leading towards the Grand&#xD;
Plaza. As they reached the Plaza, they stopped a moment to&#xD;
ask of the sentinel who trod the beat nearest them there, where&#xD;
they could find the Fiscal, and if he was the officer to grant a&#xD;
permit to visit-the prisoners in the Convent of the Capuchinas.&#xD;
A tinge of displeasure seemed to flush the man's cheek, but he&#xD;
answered, with that respect which the garb of the Sister of&#xD;
Mercy ever commands, that the Fiscal's office was in the Hotel&#xD;
across the Plaza, and perhaps they could get a permit from him,&#xD;
" though it's not likely he lets many go there visiting now. He&#xD;
may let you go, though," he added, as they passed on.&#xD;
The Plaza is but little changed since we saw it a few months&#xD;
since. The solemn figade of the Cathedral looms up on bne side;&#xD;
across, the public Hotel, with its huge court-yard; and on&#xD;
either side, the rows of shops make up the square; in the centre&#xD;
the green plats with the smooth walks, and the rows of orange-&#xD;
trees. One difference, one change is marked - the soldiers that&#xD;
lounge about the shops, or under the trees, wear the Liberal&#xD;
uniform instead of the Imperial.&#xD;
The Sisters, whom we follow, have reached the gates of the&#xD;
Hotel ;_-a word in Spanish with tle guard there, and theygo in&#xD;
as he opens the gate.&#xD;
An hour passes, and they come out again, and leaving the,&#xD;
Plaza, turn into the street leading.towards the Convent of the&#xD;
Capuchinas.&#xD;
They go in silence for some time, and at last see the gray&#xD;
walls before them. At the court-yard gate they stop, for two&#xD;
sentinels, armed with musket and bayonet, standing on either&#xD;
side, cry out, "Quien viva?"  The taller of the nuns, an-&#xD;
swers, softly, "Amigo," and passing into the court-yard, they&#xD;
are niet by a sentinel, who conducts them up the steps that&#xD;
lead to the corridor, and into the office of the 'captain of the&#xD;
guard:&#xD;

&#xD;
The Sister whom we take for many years the older of the&#xD;
two, presents a slip of paper to the officer mentioned,- a dark,&#xD;
swarthy Mexican, seated behind a little table, and attended by&#xD;
two armed corporals; He reads their passport, and with a&#xD;
gruff call of " Cabo ! " (corporal), summons a soldier in wait-&#xD;
ing from without, and directs him to show the visitors to the&#xD;
room of the Archduke Maximilian.&#xD;
Quickly and lightly the two followed the sentinel, whose&#xD;
heavy boots sounded along the corridor, as he led the way to-&#xD;
wards a door some distance in advance, and before which was&#xD;
the same grim token of durance, - the watching dragon's eye&#xD;
of the guard.&#xD;
The Sisters do not look up as the sentinels exchange the&#xD;
password; but, as the one on guard steps forward to open the&#xD;
door which bars out the blessed Liberty from the Emperor of&#xD;
Mexico, the deep, dark, piercing eyes of the older Sister&#xD;
are bent upon him, with an intense gaze of scrutiny, and as they&#xD;
pass the soldier, going in, a shining coin falls at the man's feet.&#xD;
Sister Therese turned just in time to see him stoop to pick it&#xD;
up, and as he closed the door she noted a cunning twinkle in&#xD;
his eye ; and she knew that the golden dollars that had placed&#xD;
the Emperor Maximilian within those massive walls, might&#xD;
mould a key to let him out.&#xD;
Time keeps on ; and he has gone forward another hour be-&#xD;
fore the Sisters finish their visit. The guard, an Italian, from&#xD;
his face, had accepted Sister Therese's bribe, and had extended&#xD;
his walk far enough from the Emperor's window, that he might&#xD;
only now and then catch a word, as he passed to and fro.&#xD;
"What purpose," thought he, "could lie hidden beneath the&#xD;
sable, folds of a- Sister's robe, save the good intent of spiritual&#xD;
consolation? "  And so the Italian, felt that if they had stolen&#xD;
a word or two that he had not heard, from the Emperor, it&#xD;
was no harm to the cause of the Republic. Through the court-&#xD;
gate, out into the silent square again, the Sisters pass. Hur-&#xD;
riedly and silently they walk on, until the guard at the gate is&#xD;
left quite behind. There is no one in the street save them-&#xD;
selves.&#xD;
" Sister, Th6rese," said her companion, "what can be done ?&#xD;
Since the failure of the Princess Salm, the Emperor seems hope-&#xD;
less. He does not even seem to think it right, that he should&#xD;
join in a plan of escape."&#xD;
" Softly, Jnez," whispered Sister Th6rese, -laying her finger&#xD;
upon. her lips. " My child, though our dear Emperor seems&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
hopeless, we must not be so; we must think and act quickly.&#xD;
In the name of our dear Lord, who has said, 'when all forsake,&#xD;
' He will take you up,' we must, as His instrument, save His&#xD;
children, whenever we can. There is still a chance,--a thread&#xD;
of hope, it may be, but, still a thread,  that we may save the&#xD;
Emperor."&#xD;
" Save him, Sister ! " said Inez, earnestly ; "but how? How&#xD;
can he escape through that array of bayonets, and the triple&#xD;
guard that surrounds him?1"&#xD;
" My child, when you have studied human nature as long as&#xD;
Sister Therese; when you. have moved through the world,&#xD;
and seen, as one apart, and simply looking on, the different&#xD;
phases of character among men, you will learn that, take them&#xD;
' all in all,' there is an 'Open Sesame,' to their hearts. Some-&#xD;
times we find an honorable exception; we find men whom&#xD;
neither gold, nor silver, nor self-emolument can tempt ; but that&#xD;
is not often the case here in Mexico. The guard at the gate,&#xD;
there, from the firmness in his chin, and the calm, decided look&#xD;
infhis eyes, could not be approached ; but the Italian who ad-&#xD;
nutted us to the Emperor's room, -he is our hope."&#xD;
" Alas ! Sister, a forlorn one, it seems! .And do you hope.&#xD;
to win him with bribery?"&#xD;
" Yes, Inez ! One traitor in a camp can undo an army ; and&#xD;
that same guardsman can give the Emperor his life, with our&#xD;
help. But we must work quickly and quietly. Only you and I&#xD;
can do --nothing. Our Bishop, who says vespers with us this&#xD;
evening, is a man to be trusted in these trying issues. We must&#xD;
consult with him ;. and I think I know a wounded soldier in our&#xD;
convent, who will be able, from his knowledge of the world, his&#xD;
shrewdness, his tact, and his devotion to the Emperor, to serve us.&#xD;
well. I can think of no other whom I would be willing to trust."&#xD;
They had come to their own convent ; and as they entered&#xD;
the court-yard, they found it quite deserted, save a soldier who&#xD;
half-reclined, on one of the seats' beneath the branches of a&#xD;
wild olive-tree. His eyes were half-closed, but as the Sisters;&#xD;
came up, he raised himself.&#xD;
"This is our friend," whispered Sister Th6rese, quickly, as&#xD;
they approached him.&#xD;
"Ah ! Captain, you are well enough to get about very nicely ;&#xD;
we shall have you able to cross the water, soon."&#xD;
It was an honest, open face that was turned towards them ;&#xD;
and Inez, as little as she knew of physiognomy, would have&#xD;
been willing to trust it."&#xD;

" Ahma sxur/I" answered the man, with a sigh, Ic'est&#xD;
sgal/ "it's the same thing to me now, here or in France -..&#xD;
weariness and disappointment."&#xD;
" But you must not despond so ; in a few months you will see&#xD;
Normandy."&#xD;
" Ah, yes ! my foot is but little trouble now, and I am almost&#xD;
ready to throw away my crutch; but it is the heart, the mind,&#xD;
Sister, that takes away the charm from life."&#xD;
Inez had pushed back the little black hood from her face,&#xD;
and the soldier, as she did so, turned his eyes towards her. He&#xD;
bent a keen glance of scrutiny upon, her, and an exclamation&#xD;
of surprise escaped- him.&#xD;
" La Seuorita !" he said, 11I remember you well; you, too,&#xD;
have loved the Emperor . and Empress, and you are here; too,&#xD;
to see this bitter ending ! "&#xD;
"My friend," said Inez, "your name.? your face and voice&#xD;
are strange to me, and yet you seem to know me well! "&#xD;
"I have seen theSenorita Gonzales too often with the Empress&#xD;
at the capital, at our dress parades and reviews. I - have heard&#xD;
her name from Captain Navarro and Count Khevenhaller too&#xD;
often to forget it. Who am I, senorita?  An honest French-&#xD;
man, who came to fight in good faith for the Mexican Empire&#xD;
and her ruler. What am I ? .Alas! I am ashamed to say :&#xD;
I was a Captain Joubert, in the Empress's Guard. Would to&#xD;
God, that the whole regiment and its commander had perished..&#xD;
in battle or had been sunk beneath the sea before this, stigma&#xD;
rested on it! Go back to France! " he exclaimed, "and tell&#xD;
them I. belonged to Lopez's regiment?  Never ! I cannot, I&#xD;
cannot ! "&#xD;
A hot flush overspread his face, and he half rose from the&#xD;
little seat as if he were restless under some burden.&#xD;
" But you," said Sister Th6rese, "my good friend, are not&#xD;
responsible for the actions of yoiur officers. Though he was&#xD;
false and treacherous, no one believed his men to have been so."&#xD;
" Ah, no ! " said Joubert, earnestly ; "if they could uindo&#xD;
this fearful work -if they could sav, our Emperor, by being&#xD;
marched forth and shot in his stead, they would petition it to-&#xD;
day. Dog of a traitor ! May he die the death of the wicked !&#xD;
Gods ! if they would but take my life for the Emperor's ! "&#xD;
" Do'you say this in truth, Captain Joubert ? " said Inez&#xD;
quickly ; "would you do all in your power to save your Em-&#xD;
peror ? would you risk - would you give your' life, if need be;&#xD;
to accomplish that ?" .&#xD;
&#xD;
The soldier looked, first into the calm, determined face of&#xD;
Sister Th6rese, and then into the deep, earnest, eyes of the sen.&#xD;
orita, and he seemed to read the soul of each, for he stretched&#xD;
forth his hand to Inez, and answered her question in a low,&#xD;
solemn voice.&#xD;
"Try me ! try me ! and you will see. I know what you would&#xD;
do; and God being my Helper, if it lies in the power of man,&#xD;
he shall be saved."&#xD;
"Then meet us, whispered Sister Th6rese, as she heard the&#xD;
clanging of the gate, and the porter's cracked voice,  " meet&#xD;
us after vespers in-our chapel."&#xD;
-0 -     -      * 0 -       -         0 .  0&#xD;
Captain Joubert waited behind a pillar in the vestibule of the&#xD;
chapel, until the last strains of the " Gloria Patri" had died&#xD;
away, and the saintly Sisters had passed out in solemn proces-&#xD;
sion; and then he stole silently into the little sanctuary.&#xD;
It was enveloped in a kind of gloom, for the sunlight had&#xD;
well-nigh gone. , Already had the gilded piping of, the organ&#xD;
in the little gallery fallen into the shadow, and there was&#xD;
only a glimmer of light, soft and subdued, glancing athwart the&#xD;
altar, and resting upon the burnished railing of the chancel.&#xD;
The Bishop still knelt, in his embroidered cope and white&#xD;
robe, before the altar ; and it seemed to Captain Joubert, as he&#xD;
sat and watched his upturned face, that he still-heardthe mur-&#xD;
mur of his last blessing, and felt the sanctity of his last prayer.&#xD;
"Our Lord grant us his peace, and life everlasting."&#xD;
The door at the side of the chancel, that led in from the&#xD;
Convent, softly opened, and Sister Therese and Inez entered.&#xD;
The noise of :their footfalls, slight as it was, roused the holy&#xD;
Bishop from his. devotions, and he came forward, -down the&#xD;
steps of the chancel, to where they stood, near Captain Joubert.&#xD;
"Is this our friend, Sister, ? " he asked, as Captain Joubert&#xD;
respectfully arose.&#xD;
" This is he, Father," said Sister Therese, reverently -"Cap-&#xD;
tain Joubert, who has been a faithful follower of his Emperor."&#xD;
"Then he will serve him now, in his time of direst need,&#xD;
more faithfully than ever before."&#xD;
c"I will," said Captain' Joubert, solemnly, crossing himself,&#xD;
so help me God."&#xD;
" My children," said the Bishop, "it is growing late, and we&#xD;
have but little time to hold, counsel together. Since the noon,&#xD;
Sister Th6rese, Inez, and I have been together, thinking, plan-&#xD;

that we might be enabled to preserve, in our beloved Emperor,&#xD;
a great and shining light to our Church., Listen, my son, if you&#xD;
love your Emperor, to our plan. I have never heard, your voice&#xD;
before ; but Sister Therese believes in your honesty, and I am&#xD;
therefore willing to trust you. If we can get the Emperor out&#xD;
of the Convent, he is safe, for he can easily reach the sea-&#xD;
coast ; or, if there was danger, could live for months undis-&#xD;
covered, among the mountains. I have visited his Majesty&#xD;
often since he has been in prison, and can communicate to&#xD;
him the plan we have formed for his escape, by speaking to&#xD;
him now and then, in English, which the guards cannot under-&#xD;
stand. ' Sister Th6rese and Inez have to-day bade him be ready,&#xD;
for his friends would not give him up while there was hope;&#xD;
and though the Emperor himself seems to have accepted death,&#xD;
we must save him, if it be possible. The Convent of the Capu-&#xD;
chinas is built upon thb same plan as this. The corridor on the&#xD;
second floor extends from the door of -the Emperor's room,&#xD;
along the side, into 1a narrow hall, with a window at the back.&#xD;
To reach this window from the Emperor's room, it is neces-&#xD;
sary to pass the office of the captain of the guard, at the&#xD;
door of which are stationed two corporals, whose beats extend,&#xD;
one back to the window, the other along the corridor as far as&#xD;
the sentinel on guard at the prisoners' door. The captain of&#xD;
the guardthough always in his office,is not much to be dreaded,&#xD;
as at night, one could easily pass his door without being seen,&#xD;
were it not for the sentinels. There are three of these to&#xD;
be passed, and as they cannot be gotten out of the way, it is&#xD;
possible they may be bribed. His Majesty is a good sailor,&#xD;
and once at the window it would be an easy descent with a&#xD;
rope; a few steps will bring him to the convent wall. The same&#xD;
rope thrown over, and a strong hand on the outside to draw&#xD;
him up; a fleet horse waiting in the ravine which runs below&#xD;
the Convent ; a few hours of darkness before the.dawn, - and&#xD;
he is safe.&#xD;
Inez had watched the Bishop's face as he spoke ; and now, in&#xD;
listening to his words she seemed to see the Emperor already free;&#xD;
seemed to see a ship outward bound, and seemed to hear a voice&#xD;
of joy at Miramar, crying, " He has come again - he has come&#xD;
again !" Tears of joy stole into hereyes at the thought; for&#xD;
she had known this good Bishop too long; and where he hoped,&#xD;
she believed, - where he trusted, she had faith.&#xD;
But Captain Joubert sat silent and thoughtful; he had&#xD;
listened with earnest attention to every word the Bishop&#xD;
&#xD;
spoke, and now seemed weighing them in his mind. At last&#xD;
he answered, and there was determination in his voice, and&#xD;
his eyes glowed with hope as he looked up to the Bishop.&#xD;
"'Iteshall be done !" he said firmly. " If there is a man in the&#xD;
battalion at the Convent,--- from which the guard is selected, they&#xD;
tell me, - whose ear can be tickled with the chinking of gold,&#xD;
- and I warrant there is more than one,--two days hence, you&#xD;
shall know it. But, Father, nothing but gold will do this work."&#xD;
"And I can command from our Church, here, as many dol-&#xD;
lars, for this holy purpose, as would stretch in a chain to the&#xD;
capital.,'. Sister Th6rese tells us that a single coin to-day had its&#xD;
weight with the guard on duty at the Emperor's door; if you&#xD;
can find him out,-an Italian, I should judge from the descrip-&#xD;
tion,-you may work through him."&#xD;
For an hour longer, there was a whispered consultation in&#xD;
the chapel; and when they came out, all +was arranged. The&#xD;
Bishop was to have money sufficient to bribe the guard, and to&#xD;
purchase the horses for the Emperor and Joubert, who, in case&#xD;
his Majesty escaped, would accompany him to Europe.&#xD;
Joubert was to go, on the morrow, to the encampment of&#xD;
the battalion near the Convent, in the uniform of a Liberal&#xD;
Soldier; and was to hang'about the prison, and work as best he&#xD;
could for the next few days, communicating as often as possi-&#xD;
ble with Sister Th6rese and Inez at the Convent who were to&#xD;
have a (Liberal uniform  for the Emperor also in readiness.&#xD;
Sister Th6rese and Inez were also to visit the Emperor, and&#xD;
apprize him, as best they could, of what was going on, as they&#xD;
could at any time obtain admittance, as Sisters of Mercy at the&#xD;
Convent, and their visits would create no suspicion.&#xD;
Inez would remain, as she often did, at the Convent for a&#xD;
few days; and Pedro and his wife would care for Anita during&#xD;
her absence.&#xD;
Joubert lost no time in setting about his part of the plan.&#xD;
Representing himself as a wounded soldier belonging to a&#xD;
Liberal Regiment at Puebla, but sent to the hospital at Que-&#xD;
rataro for the present, he hung about the battalion near the&#xD;
Convent, where the Emperor was confined. The officers took&#xD;
no notice of him, as lie only sat about the camp, with the men&#xD;
helping them burnish their bayonets, and making himself pop&#xD;
lar, by his ready wit and drollery, and his little anecdotes&#xD;
connected with the various Liberal victories he had been en-&#xD;
gaged in, during the last year's campaign. The men were&#xD;
quite willing to share their rations and their blanket with him,&#xD;

for his company. There was no discipline that required his&#xD;
return to the hospital, and he was a cheery comrade.&#xD;
But Joubert kept his purpose well at heart ; and he had not&#xD;
been at camp two days, as he said, before he had selected his&#xD;
men. The one with whom he began was the Italian, Del.&#xD;
Borgo, of whom Sister Therese had spoken.&#xD;
'Twas the second night of his stay at the encampment, that&#xD;
the Italian and himself were walking alone, near the wall of the&#xD;
Convent, that Joubert made his opportunity.&#xD;
An adventurer, with no character or reputation to lose, loving&#xD;
naught save money, and willing to serve any party that would&#xD;
pay him well, Del Borgo was not hard to win. Five Hundred&#xD;
in gold, to be paid the evening before the escape, and five&#xD;
hundred to be left for him at the Convent, in the city, the&#xD;
day following, and he was ready to assist in the Emperor's&#xD;
escape. He was to arrange to be on guard himself, three nights&#xD;
hence, and he was to bribe the other two sentinels on the cor-&#xD;
ridor, which he felt sure he could do. The Emperor would&#xD;
have to risk the wakefulness of the captain of the guard.&#xD;
At twelve, on the night of the 16th of June, Del" Borgo&#xD;
would unlock the Emperor's door. He should pass unmo-&#xD;
lested to the window, where he would find a rope secured so&#xD;
that he could descend. The sentinel nearest the window&#xD;
would unloose the rope, so that the Emperor could use it in&#xD;
getting over the wall. The rest, Joubert must arrange. It&#xD;
would not be discovered until near the dawn, when the guard&#xD;
would be changed, that the Emperor had escaped; when, to&#xD;
ward off suspicion, Del Borgo would give the alarm himself.&#xD;
The Emperor and Joubert would have three hours the ad-&#xD;
vantage, and that would insure them against a recapture.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVIII.&#xD;
HE convent bell struck eleven.&#xD;
"Eleven, and all well!" cried the guard at the&#xD;
bate  "All .well!" echoed the sentinel in the court-&#xD;
yard.   All well!" sounded along the corridor, from&#xD;
the corporal.a&#xD;
The Emperor turned upon his little iron bed; he rose, an&#xD;
&#xD;
walked to the window. There, upon the corridor, sat his guard,&#xD;
his head leaning against the iron railing, and his bayonet rest-&#xD;
ing upon the floor beside him. It was Del Borgo, the Italian.&#xD;
It was with a strange, confused emotion that Maximilian looked&#xD;
upon him - knew that his destiny, his life or death, lay in this&#xD;
man's hands.&#xD;
Just before the sunset Sister Th6rese and Inez had paid him&#xD;
their last visit, and in broken, interrupted snatches of English,&#xD;
told him of -their strong hope and faith in his escape. "Pure,&#xD;
noble, earnest women-may God preserve them! "prayed the&#xD;
Emperor in his heart; "though he does not bless their labor&#xD;
now, may He preserve them, and lift up their hands in His&#xD;
cause, when I am gone."&#xD;
For Inez, the Emperor had a tender, affectionate regard,&#xD;
that had grown stronger in these last days, when he saw her,&#xD;
not the grand, peerless beauty, full of pride, that he had known&#xD;
at the palace, but stricken, not alone by national sorrow, but&#xD;
bearing a heart-wound, -facing a desolation, -a future from&#xD;
which the light died out when Victor Isolani's sun went down&#xD;
bearing all with a Christian-submission that would not let her&#xD;
sit in idle grief and tears, but bade her be "up and doing,"&#xD;
while the day lasted. Maximilian remembered well when she&#xD;
had come to him first, but a few 'days before, and throwing her-&#xD;
self on her knees beside him, she had cried out, as she clasped&#xD;
his hand in hers, and pressed it to her lips,&#xD;
"My Emperor, you-shall be free! by the love of the dear Em-&#xD;
press, by the love of those in death, by the love Mexico has&#xD;
borne you, by the love of a poor maidenyour faithful subject,&#xD;
--you shall be free!"&#xD;
Ah, well! let her hope on ! another hour, and the tale would&#xD;
be told.&#xD;
The Emperor lifted his eyes, and there went up in  '  art&#xD;
the silent prayer: "As thou wilt, 0 God!" It ma e d little&#xD;
to him how it went. His heart shrank from, leaving his com-&#xD;
rades behind. Meija and- Miramon, were doomed like himself;&#xD;
now, since all his brightest hopes had been blighted, since the&#xD;
rosy mist that enveloped the future 1ad been dissolved, since&#xD;
so far, naught but miserable failure ha been the reward of his&#xD;
most earnest labor, he dreaded, almost, another trial.&#xD;
But then, despite himself, - despite the despair and despera-&#xD;
tion that came to his lips,- there was a tiny hope, a faint dream,&#xD;
that perhaps he should see Oarlotta again ; perhaps he might, in&#xD;
the years to come, at Miramar, lead her back to paths of happi-&#xD;

ness, whereon shone all the stars of heaven. And so, in his&#xD;
narrow room, he went restlessly about, waiting for the moment&#xD;
to come, waiting for the hour that seemed an eternity, to wear&#xD;
itself away ; and the Italian, sitting on the corridor without,&#xD;
hearing the impatient footsteps, bent his head upon his hands,&#xD;
and chuckled with delight at his own thoughts.&#xD;
Down in a deep ravine, behind the Convent, - caused by&#xD;
the washing rains of many winters, - whose banks were&#xD;
overhung with a thick growth of bushes, --in a -little recess,&#xD;
which shut him in from the- moonlight, Captain Joubert sat;&#xD;
he too, waiting and thinking.. Now and -then, a half-uttered&#xD;
exclamation of impatience would escape, as the stamping of&#xD;
horse's feet. from the other side of the ravine, would reach him.&#xD;
It seemed as if old Father Time had forgotten his business,.--&#xD;
that he had never lagged so before; that the moonlight had&#xD;
never shone so brightly; that horses had never been so restless;&#xD;
that he, himself, in all the days of his soldier's discipline, had&#xD;
never, on the eve of battle, in the foray wild, or in the midnight&#xD;
attack, felt so nervously apprehensive of the issue. He had, in&#xD;
the changes of his-chequered life, in France and Russia, found&#xD;
himself, in many places, face to face with death, - with capture;&#xD;
but then, it was only his poor humble self, only the aimless des-&#xD;
tiny, the striking from the lists the name of a soldier of France:&#xD;
out to-night, it was an Emperor, a Prince, above all, a noble,&#xD;
chivalric injured hero, that he would save from death. Jou-.&#xD;
bert's soul swelled within him at the thought. "God grant&#xD;
that he might succeed !" There were Inez and Sister Th6rese at&#xD;
the Convent, with sleepless eyes, keeping a prayerful vigil in&#xD;
their little cells, in trusting faith, looking for the dawn to bring&#xD;
the good tidings that "the Emperor was free!"&#xD;
There were the many hearts in Mexico, in Europe, yea, and&#xD;
in the Republic too, now cast down, that would rise up joyfully&#xD;
tohear the blessed words, "The Emperor is saved!" There was&#xD;
the gentle Empress Carlotta, who would perhaps remember to&#xD;
ask the story of how it came, and who was the man that helped&#xD;
to save her lord.&#xD;
This would be enough. Joubert did not care for honors; if&#xD;
those who loved the Emperor, would but remember Joubert,&#xD;
would but love his name for this deed,-he would be content to,&#xD;
go baok 'to the hills of Normandy, and feel that he had received&#xD;
his portion in life; that wild, adventurous, thoughtless, as he&#xD;
had been from his youth up, his life would not have been a&#xD;
failure,&#xD;
&#xD;
But if Del Borgo should be playing false ? If he should dash&#xD;
all by betrayal?  His last words when they had parted in the&#xD;
twilight behind the convent wall had been, "All's right; every-&#xD;
thing is arranged; be at the corner, where the wall is a little&#xD;
broken, precisely at twelve."&#xD;
Joubert rose; it surely must be coming near twelve. He&#xD;
w ould go up above, among the low bushes, and see"what of&#xD;
the night.",w                                       to&#xD;
Clambering up the steep ascent as lightly as a chamois hunter,&#xD;
catching occasionally the overhanging vines and shrubs, he was&#xD;
soon at the top of the bank. Stealing along through the trees,&#xD;
which grew high enough just at this point to hide him, he&#xD;
stopped and looked out.&#xD;
The moonlight fell full and clear upon the turreted roof of&#xD;
the Convent, and the high arched windows, with their diamond-&#xD;
cut panes, glittered as crystal when the rays came against them.&#xD;
Through the window, he ;could see the light within the room&#xD;
of the captain of the guard, shining steady as. a fixed star.&#xD;
On the other side of the Convent, where the battalion was&#xD;
encamped, all seemed quiet, and not a sound broke the stillness.&#xD;
To reach the long, deep shadow of the convent wall, it was&#xD;
necessary to cross an open space of fifty yards or more, from&#xD;
where Joubert stood.&#xD;
Cautiously, but quickly, Joubert stole across this, and once&#xD;
n the shadow, he crept towards the wall and made his way&#xD;
along its length, to the point agreed upon between Del Borgo&#xD;
and himself.&#xD;
Stopping, he leaned quite close to the wall, and drawing his&#xD;
pistols, which were well loaded, to the front, so that his hand&#xD;
might rest upon them, he stood in breathless, silence. He knew&#xD;
that when the Emperor had made the descent from the window,&#xD;
he would .have to run the gauntlet of the sentry within the&#xD;
garden, which now, naught but a mass of unkept shrubs and&#xD;
trees, hardly deserved the name. But the Emperor could make&#xD;
his way through these, while the sentinel was at the fhrthere&#xD;
extremity of his beat, or conceal himself amid the shrubbery,&#xD;
until he saw his chance&#xD;
The bell struck twelve. Only a few moments more, and all&#xD;
would indeed be. well. The voices of the guard sounded, and&#xD;
then again was quiet.&#xD;
Not a breeze stirred the face of nature ; not a sound broke&#xD;
upo t    ear; but a solemn, oppressive silence such as must&#xD;

&#xD;
have prevailed in the regions of Darkness and Chaos, hung over&#xD;
everything.&#xD;
fist ! Captain Joubert's well-trained ear has heard some-&#xD;
thing : was it a footstep within? He looks anxiously around;&#xD;
steals forward a few paces to reach the corner. There ! he hears&#xD;
it again; it must be the Emperor ; thank God, he is at the&#xD;
wall within ! He turns hurriedly-great heaven ! what is this?&#xD;
His eyes look into the muzzle of a pistol, and a Liberal officer&#xD;
stands at his side, and a voice, sotto voce, hisses into his ear,&#xD;
"We have no traitors in our camp ! Save yourself -your&#xD;
Emperor too, if you can:.                                .&#xD;
- For a moment Joubert looked intensely and earnestly into-&#xD;
the man's face, and it brought back to him the caf6 of old&#xD;
Puillet, and the darkly lighted midnight chamber above.&#xD;
It flashed over him in an instant: Del Borgo  had betrayed&#xD;
their plot, and he himself was to be made a prisoner in this&#xD;
man's hands. ." No, no! not while life lasted. There might be&#xD;
forty behind this officer within call; but they should not capture&#xD;
him; it should be life for life."&#xD;
"-By the God above us !" he exclaimed, drawing his pistol&#xD;
with one hand, and with the other wrenching the one from the&#xD;
hand of his antagonist, "if you have cheated the Emperor of&#xD;
life, you shall give your own for it !&#xD;
A shrill whistle rang out on the air, and a volley of oaths&#xD;
succeeded. His antagonist has given alarm to those who&#xD;
are doubtless in waiting, and is now attacking him with his&#xD;
sabre. Joubert, as he fires and sends a death-message to the&#xD;
heart of the officer, sees, just beyond, a dozen or more Liberal&#xD;
soldiers rushing towards them. A-sudden hope leaps into his&#xD;
heart. If he could but reach the ravine, there might be a&#xD;
chance of escape ! It is death in any event: his opponent lies&#xD;
at his feet, and he will make the desperate risk.&#xD;
A second later, and he is crossing the open space. A dozen&#xD;
balls whiz past him, and he hears the footsteps of the soldiers&#xD;
in pursuit. He turns and fires as he plunges down the descent&#xD;
into the .ravine ; his shot is echoed behind him. If he can&#xD;
but reach the horses on the other side, he is safe. He hears&#xD;
them following him in the ravine. . Upward he climbs, -he&#xD;
has lost his footing -he is lost now ! No ! there is a vine,&#xD;
thank God ! He pulls himself up-he has reached the bank -&#xD;
he has mounted one of the horses tied beyond ! On, on he goes,&#xD;
leaving his pursuers still in the ravine -on, on towards the&#xD;
&#xD;
sea-coast ! Joubert is safe'! but the Emperor  there is naught&#xD;
but death for him!&#xD;
Yes; Del Borgo had played him false; had beguiled, with a&#xD;
promise of life, and had mocked him with death. And as the&#xD;
little Italian kept up his beat through the night-hours, know-&#xD;
ing that his prisoner was waiting for a sound he should never&#xD;
hear, was dreaming of a land, a face, he should n ver see ;&#xD;
as he thought of Joubert duped and captured himself, there&#xD;
was a chuckle again of demoniac satisfaction, that he had over-&#xD;
reached their well-laid plans.&#xD;
The dawn came; and Inez and Sister Th6rese knelt in the&#xD;
chapel, and in their hearts the matin prayer shaped itself into&#xD;
the words that had gone up as holy nocturne through the&#xD;
night-: "God preserve them ! God keep them, and speed them&#xD;
to safety ! "&#xD;
But the prayers were hushed and they were stricken dumb&#xD;
with grief, when, before the day had grown an hour older, there&#xD;
was murmured throughout the convent, that the morning vis-&#xD;
itors had brought the report of "'an attempt made the night&#xD;
before to rescue the Emperor by bribing the guard. One of&#xD;
them, however, had disclosed the plot to Captain Juan Gonzales,&#xD;
of Regiment ., who had, with a few picked men, waited&#xD;
without the convent walls for thedevelopment of the plot. In&#xD;
the contest between Captain Gonzales and the man, who was&#xD;
waiting to assist the Emperor to escape, Captain Gonzales was&#xD;
shot dead before his men could get to him, and the man&#xD;
'escaped.  It was not known how many were concerned in&#xD;
the plot, nor who were the parties, save the one who had, as a&#xD;
Liberal soldier, attempted to execute the plan. In future, the&#xD;
guard about the Emperor would be increased; no visitors&#xD;
would be allowed him, except under the closest surveillance,&#xD;
and he would be doubtless kept secure until the execution,&#xD;
which was now but three days hence."&#xD;
Inez was stunned. Great Father ! he had been permitted to&#xD;
cross her path again. She sank down o her knees beside&#xD;
Sister Therese, in the little cell, and  '  her face in her&#xD;
hands, she exclaimed,&#xD;
" Sister, he is the spirit of evil that has darkened my life ;&#xD;
and his last act, unconsciously, perhaps, with him, has been to&#xD;
strike another blow in hate ! "&#xD;
Sister Th6rese knew of the estrangement of this wicked man&#xD;
from his family.. She knew the character he bore; but knew&#xD;
not half the burden he had laid upon the patient, gentle girl at&#xD;
&#xD;

her side. Yet, she spoke the words that were fittest at this&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
" My child, he has met his reward ! His soul stands before&#xD;
the Great Throne disrobed ; trembling, before the glance of&#xD;
the One who sitteth thereon: It is godlike to forgive, aye,&#xD;
seventy times seven. We have done everything that was&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
i T is the night before the execution. The prisoners&#xD;
have, during the day, been assigned to the room for-&#xD;
merly used as the chapel of the convent, where they&#xD;
are to pass the last night together. A long, dark&#xD;
apartment on the ground floor, with windows looking into the&#xD;
court-yard on one side, and on the other into the garden be-&#xD;
hind the Convent. At one end of the apartment is the altar,&#xD;
draped in black; and the dim light of two or three wax tapers&#xD;
scarcely dispels the shadows lurking in the further corners.&#xD;
Upon a low couch, in one corner, the gallant Meija lay sleep-&#xD;
ing, as calmly unconscious of danger as an infant. His lion&#xD;
heart is not appalled by the vision of death; and God has&#xD;
kindly shut out from his eyes, for a while, the cruel fate that&#xD;
points hour by hour to his waning life.&#xD;
But a little distance from the altar, near a grated window, is&#xD;
General Miramon, and by his side sits Father Fischer, whisper-&#xD;
ing, in a low, half-audible voice, words of heavenly promise&#xD;
and consolation.&#xD;
To and fro, backward and forward from the altar to the fur-&#xD;
ther end of the long room, his proud head bowed upon his&#xD;
bosom as an eagle would droop his crest, apparently lost in&#xD;
thought and deep meditation, the Emperor, Maximilian keeps&#xD;
up a measured tread. -Bearing himself nobly to the last, and&#xD;
steeling his heart against the tender emotions at would now&#xD;
and then rush over his soul, Maxirgilian face the inevitable"&#xD;
wih the same high spirit and noble consciousness of rectitude'&#xD;
that has borne him so heroically throughout his declining for.,&#xD;
&#xD;
tunes. He approached the window, near which Meija slept,&#xD;
and leaning against the stone casement, looked ,out upon the&#xD;
beauty of the night. In the distance, were the misty moun-&#xD;
tains, always the prominent feature in the perspective of&#xD;
* Mexican scenery. The silver moon shining above in the blue&#xD;
sky, with a beauty'unknown in colder climes, and the deep hue&#xD;
of the tropical empyrean vault, set forth the stars as diamond&#xD;
points of light. Now and then, a passing cloud obscured the&#xD;
brilliant faces, but the Queen of the night would ride forth&#xD;
from the shadowy depths, and again bend her chat yant eyes&#xD;
upon the sleeping earth beneath. The saturnalia of animal life&#xD;
had begun in the garden below. A thousainsects whose life&#xD;
would wither at the north wind's blast, kept up a ceaseless song&#xD;
in the shadows of the trees.&#xD;
If there is an unseen power that invests a spirit standing&#xD;
upon the verge of eternity with strength to triumph over&#xD;
human, fear and weakness; with such power to-night was the&#xD;
Emperor enabled to rise above the finite purposes of mor-.&#xD;
tality; and he stood divested of the hopes and fears that hang&#xD;
about the tenement of clay. With him, Thought alone lived;&#xD;
all else was crushed. He knew that;the end was come. Inez&#xD;
Gonzales, in1 her noble, heroicnature had cast the last die,&#xD;
and it had failed.&#xD;
.Standing there in the stillness of the midnight, with no&#xD;
sound save the measured tread of the watching sentry and the&#xD;
low, suppressed breathing of the sleeping warriors near him, in&#xD;
calm reflection his thoughts went back into the past. He num-&#xD;
bered over the rise and fall of the powers of the earth from&#xD;
earliest antiquity down to the last act of his own drama.&#xD;
All along the pathway of history he saw' them,-the fallen em-&#xD;
pires, kingdoms, and nations, and above their ruins, he saw in&#xD;
fancy the ghost of a weeping Marius. There was Rome and&#xD;
Athens. Though the proud eagle fed upon'the vitals of Attic&#xD;
liberty ; though it winged its flight even to Palestine, -yet the&#xD;
shadow of years dimmed the silver stars of the crescent that&#xD;
glittered through the land of Judea.&#xD;
Hush ! Softly and sweetly amid the trees in the garden&#xD;
below, coming up to the lonely prisoner as an echo of that&#xD;
happy time of boyhood, breathing into his soul afresh the mem-&#xD;
ory of the green hills of his native land, that his eyes shall never&#xD;
look on more, -softly and tenderly sounds out the midnight&#xD;
 song of the nightigale; now a wild carol of melody, and now&#xD;
* the subdued notes of sadness, akin to knowledge of human woe.&#xD;

&#xD;
Aye, it does bring up -that midnight song - those years&#xD;
gone by ; Vienna - the Prater -Isolani - Trieste - the blue.&#xD;
waves of the Adriatic- Miramar - Carlotta!&#xD;
He thought of how the world was going on, little heeding,&#xD;
and little recking, perhaps, that he should perish. There was '&#xD;
his royal brother, united at last in- love and concord to his&#xD;
Hungarian subjects. He remembered the heroes of his ancient&#xD;
house; one by one, with all honor, they had been gathered&#xD;
to the tomb of the Hapsburgs. Had he striven less faithfully&#xD;
than they to add a leaf to the crown of the Hapsburgs?  Ah!&#xD;
he had done his best, and there was but one thing left for him&#xD;
now, - to die like a Hapsburg ! A strong, gpdlike feeling lifted&#xD;
his soul, and a glance of triumph. beamed in his eye, as he ex-&#xD;
claimed, half aloud,--&#xD;
" I shall die gloriously, like a king !"&#xD;
He turned from tie window, and his eye fell upon the sleep-&#xD;
ing Meija. He, too, was to die, -to share his fate; he had been&#xD;
faithful unto the end. As Maximilian gazed upon the dark,&#xD;
heavily-cut features, and thought of the battles this hero had&#xD;
fought and won for him; thought of how often they had fought&#xD;
together for the Empire, and now they were to die together,&#xD;
-he placed his hand upon the sleeper's head, and in his heart&#xD;
invoked a blessing on him; prayed silently that together their,&#xD;
spirits might pass through the shadowy land, and together rest&#xD;
before the Eternal Throne.&#xD;
The saddest farewells were yet to come ; there must be a&#xD;
last adieu to his mother and to Carlotta. His mother ! a hal-&#xD;
lowed name ! The first his lips had learned to breathe ; to her&#xD;
lie must send the message, that her son bore with him the&#xD;
memory of her last blessing, through all the days of his absence.&#xD;
And to the wife -the last words of love he penned in the&#xD;
midnight stillness: -&#xD;
" MY BELOVED CARLOTTA:&#xD;
"If God permits that thy health be restored, and you should&#xD;
read these lines, you will learn the cruelty with which fate has&#xD;
stricken thy husband, since thy departure for Europe. So&#xD;
many untoward events, so many sudden blows have shattered&#xD;
all,my hopes, that death is a happy deliverance, 'not an agony.&#xD;
I shall die gloriously, like a king ; vanquished, but.not dishon-&#xD;
ored. If your sufferings are too gr at, and God should call you&#xD;
soon to join me, I shall bless his  iine hand. .Adieu! adieu !&#xD;
(,Your&#xD;
"AXIMILIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
The night is growing old, and the hours are waning. Al-&#xD;
ready the bells have sounded the midnight, and slowly, but&#xD;
surely, it neareth the dawn.&#xD;
Father Fischer has risen, and stands before the altar. Sol-&#xD;
emnly, the three penitents draw near, and kneel before him on&#xD;
the steps of the altar. Together they pray God to have mercy&#xD;
upon His servants, about to pass from earth-life into the mys-&#xD;
teries of Eternity.&#xD;
One by one they receive the holy sacrament, and Father&#xD;
Fischer pronounces the absolution. For hours they kneel&#xD;
there, each one pleading in the holy prayers of the last mass&#xD;
for the salvation of his soul.&#xD;
Now and then, the silence, deep and solemn, is broken by the&#xD;
voice of the Father, as he repeats, again and again, the earnest&#xD;
prayer, " Kyrie Eleison!"&#xD;
" Kyrie Eleison !:" echo the kneeling penitents; "hear, 0&#xD;
Lord, and have mercy upon us ! "&#xD;
As the words oT the requiem tremblingly sound forth, "Eter-&#xD;
nal rest give to them, 0 Lord; and let perpetual shine upon&#xD;
them!" the first faint glimmerings of the Dies Irm, creep into&#xD;
the eastern horizon, and stealing through the grated windows&#xD;
of the Convent, rest in gloomy indistinctness upon the bended&#xD;
forms of those, whose sun of life is nearly set.&#xD;
The first rays of a June sun are gleaming over the empyrean&#xD;
brow of the lofty Cordilleras peaks, and slanting downward,&#xD;
over the sloping descents, dissolving the vapor of the-curling&#xD;
mists, bathing rock, tree, and tower in golden light, and rest&#xD;
at last in - a halo over a city of the tropic. Above, the blue&#xD;
sky, gazing down upon Querataro and its environs, takes in a&#xD;
Paradise picture, richer in romance and beauty, than the cre-&#xD;
ation of a poet's fancy.&#xD;
How truly does the All-seeing One present each day to the&#xD;
children of men His longsuffering and holy. forbearance !&#xD;
and how patiently does he stay'the avenging hand of outraged&#xD;
Justice, until that day of wrath, when he shall claim the time&#xD;
for vengeance as his own! Why does He send His rain upon&#xD;
the just and the unjust alike ?  Why did the glorious bright-&#xD;
ness of that June sun gladden the hearts of the men of evil&#xD;
purpose in Mexico,° who waited for daylight and sunshine to&#xD;
witness' their mocking sacrifice to Liberty ? The sun shines&#xD;
on ; not alone over mountain-side and 4balley, but its beams&#xD;
falling in the city, over the marble facade of some holy temple,&#xD;

over the diamond spray of a jetting fountain, over the orange.&#xD;
trees of the Plaza, flashes upon the burnished steel of bayonet&#xD;
and sabre, and fell on dark, vengeful faces, or the calm, inciif-&#xD;
.ferent- countenances of the soldiery, who were gathering near&#xD;
the Convent of the Capuchinas.&#xD;
At ,an early hour on this fatal day, Inez Gonzales arose.&#xD;
She made a hasty toilette, and, going to the latticed window,&#xD;
threw it wide, that the day and its light might come in. Over&#xD;
the far away hills, the vapors - round the mountain curl,"&#xD;
and below among the trees of the garden, the gleeful birds&#xD;
trilled forth a song of welcome to the dawn. , As few as the&#xD;
hours of the summer night had been, they had dragged along&#xD;
with leaden weight to Inez, for there had been with her that&#xD;
fevered turmoil of thought that, tries the brain and wearies the&#xD;
heart; and this morning, she stood by the open window, sick&#xD;
and faint in spirit, pining to throw down the burden of life.&#xD;
Looking, out over the plains, from which the purple shadows"&#xD;
had fled, the birds of thought sped onward, over the mountain&#xD;
and hill-top, over the fields of cactus, over the-orange-groves, to&#xD;
the shores that are lapped by the waters of the broad Atlantic ;&#xD;
and onward still, over the Adriatic gulf, they reach the castled&#xD;
crag, apd rest with the one who, but a few months since,&#xD;
was her friend and companion, and whose blighted life calls up&#xD;
now a tear of bitter grief. Inez remembers the sweet days of&#xD;
the past ; when those " sweet bells were all attuned in har-&#xD;
mony ;" and as she thinks of her Empress, now as unconscious&#xD;
as the sleeping babe, of the great, dark curtain of sorrow that&#xD;
is to shut out the light from the future, she falls upon her.&#xD;
knees,,and her heart goes forth in a despairing, Tlectra-like&#xD;
plaint:&#xD;
" Oh, my Empress ! I have done all,-all that I could, and it&#xD;
is naught ! " She bowed her head upon the gray stone ledge&#xD;
of the window-casement before her, and her voice was hushed;&#xD;
but remembering, perhaps, the omniscience of that God who&#xD;
destroyed the " rider and his host," who did not hold back His&#xD;
power from His chosen people of old, she could not keep back&#xD;
from her lips the prayer of her heart :&#xD;
" Great God ! great God ! save him, save him, even now, if&#xD;
it be possible ! The hand of man is as naught before thee !&#xD;
Save him now, if it be possible !'&#xD;
In all reverence Inez spoke; in all reverence she plead to&#xD;
the Mighty Being she called her Father. Whiy should He not&#xD;
do this great thing in answer to her .prayer, if she prayed&#xD;
&#xD;
aright, as He had answered Joshua when the sun stood still&#xD;
upon Gibeon, and the,moon in the valley of Ajalon, until the&#xD;
children of Israel had prevailed over their enemies?&#xD;
Ah ! if the prayer be offered aright ! God moves in a mys-&#xD;
terious way, and though it be the right or the wrong that tri-&#xD;
umphs the Judge of the earth will give the reward in His own&#xD;
good time.&#xD;
But leaving Inez Gonzales alone with her grief and her&#xD;
tears, and her efforts at saving faith and trust in God, let us&#xD;
look to those who are to be th actors in the bloody drama at&#xD;
Querataro.&#xD;
At the Convent of the Capuchinas, the burning exhalations&#xD;
of the roseate dawn, have given place to a golden halo in the&#xD;
eastern sky. The large brazen bell of the convent is tolling&#xD;
the hour of seven; and,floating on the morning air, are strains&#xD;
of martial  usic. Coming nearer and nearer to the Convent,&#xD;
is the slow, _ ,easured tread of the Liberal soldiers, who are to&#xD;
form the escort of death. The command of their officer,&#xD;
"Halt !" rings forth, and they form themselves in unbroken&#xD;
file on either side of the court-yard gate, and with burnished&#xD;
bayonets flashing in the sunlight, they wait in silence the com-&#xD;
ing of the prisoners.&#xD;
Not long do they wait. There are sounds of footsteps along&#xD;
the corridor, and in the court-yard within. The huge gates are&#xD;
thrown open, and, coming forward between two armed sexitinels,&#xD;
followed by four darkly clad Franciscan monks, is the Em-&#xD;
peror, General Miramon, and General Meija. Calm and un-&#xD;
moved, with not, a muscle in the face of either betokening&#xD;
aught, save a determination to meet death as braveamen should,.&#xD;
they stop for a moment at the convent gates. With lion-like&#xD;
glance, looking first at the soldiers on either side, General&#xD;
Meija turned to the Emperor, and in a clear, ringing voice, ex-&#xD;
claimed,-&#xD;
" Our Emperor, show us for the last time the example of&#xD;
your noble courage ! We follow in the footsteps of your Ma-&#xD;
jesty! "&#xD;
Maximilian turned to him with a smile of quiet dignity, and,&#xD;
while his lip curled with conscious heroism, as he took the ad-&#xD;
vance, he answered,-&#xD;
" Vamos nos a libertadI/ Let us advance to liberty!" "&#xD;
The soldiers form on either side, and conduct the prisoners&#xD;
to the carriages waiting a short distance in front.&#xD;
The solemn procession wound its way along the outskirts of&#xD;

&#xD;
the city, by the route of the aqueduct, and soon reached a hill-&#xD;
top, near the Cerro de las Campanas, overlooking the plain of&#xD;
execution.&#xD;
The carriages are stopped, and the prisoners decend from&#xD;
them. As the Emperor stood near the wall of the cemetery&#xD;
on one side, he paused for a moment to drink in the beauty of&#xD;
the last earth-picture his eyes should see. The heavy curtain&#xD;
of mist that had hung around the distant mountains, was roll-&#xD;
ing up before the sunshine, and, according to the fancy of the&#xD;
beholder, assumed a hundred 'grotesque shapes ; now curling&#xD;
gently downwards, and conforming to a thousand hillside in-&#xD;
dentations, now.rising upward into the castled battlements of&#xD;
some huge tower. of wild architectural beauty, and gradually&#xD;
dissolving in vapor, floating sky-ward. Above all, the glorious&#xD;
sun grandly and proudly moving in his onward course.&#xD;
Fixing his eye upon that monarch, with his enduring crown,&#xD;
the one who had lost kingdom, crown, and all in life, exclaimed,&#xD;
as if in colloquy with his own soul:&#xD;
" How grand, how glorious, is heaven and earth ! Thank&#xD;
God for death 'neath, the clear sky, on a day like this ! " And&#xD;
then, with the thought of the nearness.of the fatal hour came&#xD;
again the memory of those he was to leave upon earth. He&#xD;
drew from his breast a watch, and touching the spring, re-&#xD;
vealed .the face of her who had been his all in all in life. He&#xD;
pressed it fervently to 'his lips, and, impulsively turning to the&#xD;
priestly Father who stood by him, he whispered,--&#xD;
" Carry this souvenir to her; and should she ever be able to&#xD;
understand you, tell her that my eyes were closed with her&#xD;
image before them, and I bore it with me to Heaven."&#xD;
The sad, dirge-like strains of the dead march, and the sound&#xD;
of the'muffled drum beating before them, tells that they have&#xD;
reached the place of execution; and from behind, where they&#xD;
have left the city, the convent bells begin to toll a solemn knell.&#xD;
The crowd, that has gathered as they came out, press forward&#xD;
with eager curiosity ; but as the three prisoners are led for-&#xD;
ward, and assigned #o places in front of the double row of sol-&#xD;
diers, already formed with muskets charged, the soldiery keep&#xD;
back the idle gazers.&#xD;
On one side are ranged in solemn order the praying monks,&#xD;
who witl devoted piety hold aloft the blessed cross, and from&#xD;
time to time devoutly make the sign of the holy symbol, as&#xD;
they call upon the "blessed Virgin," and dole forth their" Ave&#xD;
Marias !"&#xD;
&#xD;
The Emperor has his position in the centre, and extending&#xD;
his arms, first to Miramon, and then to his favorite Meija, he&#xD;
clasped them to his' heart in a last embrace. As he. turns his&#xD;
face again to the waiting soldiery, the commanding officer rides&#xD;
forward, and, as if in fiendish hate to stab the royal victim at&#xD;
the last,'reads out the inhuman edict*that had been issued the&#xD;
day before:&#xD;
"Soldiers ! in the name of the nation, he who solicits mercy&#xD;
for these criminals, shall be shot as a traitor himself! "&#xD;
The hushed and solemn stillness that hung over the crowd&#xD;
was broken by a piercing shriek; and between the armed sole&#xD;
diery and the three who were waiting the last messenger of&#xD;
death, there rushed a young girl, her long, dark hair floating on&#xD;
the wind, and her eyes turned upward, with an earnest, intense&#xD;
fire. Falling upon her knees before the soldiers, whose mus-&#xD;
kets were already levelled for their fatal aim, and clasping her&#xD;
hands, she exclaimed, --&#xD;
"There is a voice, 0 Emperor ! to plead thy cause -- to&#xD;
plead the cause of virtue, chivalry, and honor ! Oh ! Mexicans,&#xD;
beware, beware ! The.Most High God, will open the vials of&#xD;
His wrath upon, those that do this cruel murder. If ye have&#xD;
human hearts, spare him ! spare him ! "&#xD;
Inez Gonzales fell, fainting and prostrate, before the soldiery.&#xD;
The vindictive voice of the commanding officer rang out again:&#xD;
"Ready ! - Aim ! --Fire ! "&#xD;
Sharp and quick, the shots came in succession. And speeding&#xD;
over the body of-the heroic girl, the deed is done. Amidst the&#xD;
smoke that gathers above them, lie the murdered prostrate forms&#xD;
of Maximilian, Miramon, and Meija.&#xD;
Mexico ! the messenger that struck the life from the heart&#xD;
of thy Emperor, plunged its dagger to thy vitals also ! The&#xD;
star of Empire that had ,paused o'er thee, takes its -onward&#xD;
course, and leaves thee again to darkness and desolation. The&#xD;
hand of .destruction that was laid upon the Halls of the Mon-&#xD;
tezumas, and crumbled their pride into dust, shall not spare&#xD;
thee. In that great day of the nations' reckoning, canst thou&#xD;
plead, "Remember mercy"?    The spirit of the dead of the&#xD;
Alamo - --of Fannin and his murdered heroes, and of the latest&#xD;
noble victims, shall cry out for "Vengeance !" And through the&#xD;
rolling ages of eternity, the words shall. burn in the souls of&#xD;
thy sons, and echo forever, in their ears, in condemnation,&#xD;
" That mercy ILto others show,&#xD;

CHAPTER L.&#xD;
&#xD;
HANDSOMELY furnished library of a private resi.&#xD;
dence near the centre of the beautiful city of La Puebla.&#xD;
d) The room is fitted up with all the comforts and luxu-&#xD;
ries which wealth can procure. A case of well-bound&#xD;
volumes extends across one side ; and opposite is a heavily&#xD;
carved" escritoire, surmounted by a bronze bust of Hidalgo.&#xD;
Upon the frescoed walls hang several portraits, whose dark col-&#xD;
oring and antique frames accord well with the sombre richness&#xD;
of the apartment. Through the vine-covered lattice of the win-&#xD;
dows, the dying sunlight casts a thousand fantastic shadows&#xD;
upon the ingrained oaken floor. Now and then, there comes in&#xD;
a tiny zephyr, like,-_&#xD;
" The sweet south, that breathes, upon a bank&#xD;
Of violets ; stealing and giving odor."&#xD;
But the sunlight, the shadows, and the wooings of the gen-&#xD;
tle breeze are alike unheeded by the occupant of this silent&#xD;
chamber. A man quite at the top of the hill of life, his hair&#xD;
just silvered, and his brow, somewhat wrinkled with the furrows&#xD;
of passing years, contracted now by deep thought, almost into&#xD;
a frown..&#xD;
Colonel Lopez sits-by the table, strewn with papers and books,&#xD;
near the centre of ,the room; his head resting upon his hand,&#xD;
and his eyes cast downward upon the polished oak. What is&#xD;
it that gives him such deep thought? what is it that makes&#xD;
him forget all outside-things ? --&#xD;
Ah ! Judas, Judas ! though thou hast already clutched the&#xD;
shining gold that bought thy honor, thou hast not been able to&#xD;
sell thy Conscience as easily as thou didst thy master!t If thou&#xD;
couldst hush those voices that come to thee in the daylight, and&#xD;
in the midnight, ringing in thine ears, "Remorse ! remorse ! "if&#xD;
thou couldst get away from the dark shadow that follows thee&#xD;
everywhere, that is with thee at thy incoming and thy out-&#xD;
going, in the sanctuary, in the - cafe, in the thoroughfare;&#xD;
&#xD;
CROWN JEWELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
423&#xD;
&#xD;
that points at thee the finger of scorn, and cries out so&#xD;
loudly that the multitude catches the echo, "Behold the&#xD;
traitor !" -if thou couldst murder and silence these, then,-per-&#xD;
haps, in triumph and peace thou mightst count over thy treas-&#xD;
ure, and cry)to thy craven soul, "Eureka!&#xD;
But they are with him, constant and true; damning him to&#xD;
himself, moment by moment, hour by hour.&#xD;
He sits there with his head bowed, listening to the voice&#xD;
that is telling him low, the history of the day well-nigh past.&#xD;
In desperation, he rises, and with a half-muttered oath, strides&#xD;
backward and forward, his hands clasped behind him, and his&#xD;
head thrown up, as if in attempt to bid defiance to those who&#xD;
scoff him.&#xD;
In vain ! He cannot get away ! He flings himself again in&#xD;
his chair, and is silent while the spirit voice speaks. It tells&#xD;
him of-the morning hour, whQn he reached his home at Puebla,&#xD;
and sought the presence of his wife ; and brings up to him&#xD;
again the words of contempt and scorn with which she spurned&#xD;
him from her presence. It points to him -himself -cowering&#xD;
before her calm, earnest eyes, when she tells him, "he is un-&#xD;
worthy to be her husband.". Wrought up in heart. by shame,&#xD;
and a sense of misery and disgrace, he rushed from her presence&#xD;
and descends into the street below. lie goes onward through&#xD;
the street, endeavoring to hold his head aloft, and to whisper&#xD;
to his soul that " he has gold,- and gold, thank God! will com-&#xD;
mand, will buy respect ; for Mammon rules the world!"  A&#xD;
party'of Liberal troopers - a wild, reckless set, are turning into&#xD;
the street just before him. Such a clattering of horses' hoofs&#xD;
have drawn curious eyes to the windws on either side. Colonel&#xD;
Lopez carries his head higher still, and tries to walk proudly&#xD;
on as they pass. But a keen eye has noted him, a whisper runs&#xD;
through the file of soldiers; and, as they put spurs to their&#xD;
horses, a mocking shout is heard,-" Long life to Judas!.&#xD;
Long life to Lopez ! "&#xD;
"Curse those. insolent dogs ! Diaz shall know of this !&#xD;
Specimens of Liberal discipline ! They shall suffer- for this,&#xD;
and learn to fear the name of Miguel Lopez!"&#xD;
Heated with arnger, he turned into a well-known. restaurant&#xD;
and cafe, kept by a Spaniard, on the principal street, and&#xD;
much frequented by the gentlemen of the upper class, and the&#xD;
officers of whichever army happened to be in possession of the&#xD;
city. There were half a score or more to-day, lounging about&#xD;
the caf6; some taking their brandy and refreshments at the&#xD;

&#xD;
little tables towards the back of the room;' others are le aming&#xD;
on the counter near the front, discussing and arguing the pro-&#xD;
gress of military events.&#xD;
As he entered, and ordered brandy and refreshments, there&#xD;
were curious gazes cast upon him by the idlers. He wore the&#xD;
Liberal uniform, but he was not an officer that they had been&#xD;
accustomed to seeing about Puebla. Only over the dark face&#xD;
of the old Spaniard at the bar, there passed a look of recogni-&#xD;
tion, and a momentary smile of contempt.. He remembered&#xD;
Miguel Lopez; many a glass of brandy had he dealt out to him&#xD;
before; for it had been for long years Rinaldo had kept this&#xD;
caf6 on the Plaza of Puebla.&#xD;
Colonel Lopez had finished his brandy, and stood waiting for-&#xD;
Rinaldo to take up the piece of gold that he had laid down upon&#xD;
the counter. There was a glance of triumph, and a wicked&#xD;
smile dancing in the keen black eye of the little Spaniard, as&#xD;
he took up the coin and hurled it through the open door into&#xD;
the Plaza.&#xD;
Senor! "he exclaimed, "we do not receive here the price&#xD;
of blood ! Seunor Lopez may drink our brandy, but we cannot&#xD;
take his gold 1" Reaching forward, he took up the glass from&#xD;
which, a few moments before, Colonel Lopez had drank. " That&#xD;
no gentleman may pollute his lips in our caf6, by touching the&#xD;
glass which a traitor has used, perish it thus !"  He dashed&#xD;
the glass upon the stone floor behind him, and it was shivered&#xD;
into a hundred pieces.&#xD;
Colonel Lopez looked up in surprise. His face flushed, and&#xD;
his heart trembled, as he met the looks of those around; and, as&#xD;
he turned to leave the cafe, conscience-stricken, he heard behind&#xD;
him a ringing laugh, and many voices joining in the words,-&#xD;
"Bravo, Rinaldo ! bravo ! We all drink to your good&#xD;
health! "&#xD;
Maddened almost to. desperation, he hurried away from 'the&#xD;
Plaza. He did not look into the faces now, of those he met ;&#xD;
there was no pride in his bearing, nor in his eye ; he wanted to&#xD;
get away from the crowded street, from human eyes, from him-&#xD;
self. Would to God that he' could !.&#xD;
On -- on - he went, he knew not whither. Up and down&#xD;
the long, stony streets; now by an. ivy-covered convent, and&#xD;
now by a solemn-faced cathedral.  It was in' vain; there&#xD;
was no rest for him. The very stones. over which he hurried&#xD;
seemed to cry out to him, "Traitor ! traitor !There was a&#xD;
mocking spirit in the-breeze --in the jangling of the city bells,&#xD;
&#xD;
as they sounded out, that seemed to echo the words, "Traitor!&#xD;
traitor!" 0 God! he could not stand it ! To be thus hooted&#xD;
at, aid scorned by the lowest of the Liberal soldiery ; to- be&#xD;
publicly insulted by a rascal of a caf6-keeper;. and to feel that&#xD;
it was the truth, -that he could not resent it ! That he had&#xD;
given the Juarists what they wanted - a Republic, had rid&#xD;
them of the Emperor; and scarcely was the life-current stopped&#xD;
in his heart before he, the deliverer, was scorr ed !&#xD;
At last, with the turmoil still in his  t,with the surg-&#xD;
ings of pride and the lashings of conscience beating upon his&#xD;
soul he found himself before the court-yard of his own house.&#xD;
Mechanically, he went in; and avoiding even the looks of the&#xD;
domestics who stood chatting in the court, he hurried through&#xD;
the corridors to the library, and shut himself up.&#xD;
Through the long hours since the noontime, he has been&#xD;
there alone ; and, now at the twilight, the same voice haunts&#xD;
him with -her truthful word-pictures of himself, inadderi~im&#xD;
again with this record of the day.&#xD;
"This -- this, is thy reward, Miguel Lopez!" sounds like a&#xD;
knell to his heart,---" hated -despised - contemned !"&#xD;
A sound of footsteps along the corridor without; the door&#xD;
is softly opened, and' the voice of a servant rouses Colonel&#xD;
Lopez from his bitter meditation.&#xD;
" Seior, a lady below asks permission to speak with you.in&#xD;
private for a few minutes."&#xD;
"A lady?" repeatedColonel Lopez thoughtfully. " Does&#xD;
she send, up her name? "&#xD;
"S She does not, senor. I should call her a Holy Sister, from&#xD;
her dress," added the man. "She bade me say she would de-&#xD;
tain you only a short ' while.A&#xD;
SyThen show her here,"said Colonel Lopez, after some hesi-&#xD;
tation. "There can be no trick in it!" he half whispered.&#xD;
" A nun, did you say, Pietro ? " to the man, who had waited to&#xD;
close the windows, and was now lighting the large, heavy lamp&#xD;
that hung suspended over the table.&#xD;
tI did not see her face, senior, but her dress was black."&#xD;
The servant left the room, and Colonel Lopez walked uneasily&#xD;
back and forth, awaiting his visitor. There was a soft,' subdued&#xD;
light resting upon the dark faces upon the walls, rounding the&#xD;
sharp ctt angles of th6 carved, bookcases, and driving the&#xD;
shadows into the dreamy twilight that lurked still in the cor-&#xD;
ners of the apartment. Around the table in the centre, upon&#xD;
te polished oaken floor, there rested a luminous circleo  h&#xD;

&#xD;
light that came down, steady and clear, from the flame under&#xD;
the crystal shade above.&#xD;
Colonel Lopez stopped and rested his hand upon the table,&#xD;
as the - servant again opened the door, and his visitor entered&#xD;
unannounced.&#xD;
A woman, slightly above medium height, attired in a heavy&#xD;
trailing dress of black, her face- covered by a deep mourning&#xD;
veil, that fell in folds far down the skirt, stood before him.&#xD;
As the door closed behind her, and the sound of the servant's-&#xD;
retreating footsteps were heard growing less distinct, she&#xD;
pushed aside^ her veil, and revealed to Colonel Lopez, who&#xD;
stood anxiously waiting, a face belonging to one, some three or&#xD;
four and twenty, - a face, that was beautiful, in its dark&#xD;
Spanish cast, with a touch of hauteur slightly curling the proud&#xD;
lips ; beautiful in spite of the traces of suffering which rested&#xD;
upon it. As she lifted her deep, lustrous eyes to Colonel Lopez,&#xD;
a look of recognition passed over his face ; and going forward,&#xD;
he exclaimed quickly, -&#xD;
" Do I mistake, or have I the honor of speaking to Seuorita&#xD;
Gonzales ? If my memory serves me rightly, I have seen La&#xD;
Senorita before at -at-"&#xD;
He hesitated, with evident embarrassment; {to be definite&#xD;
with his past, was not pleasant now to Colonel Lopez.&#xD;
"You are right, Colonel Lopez," said Inez calmly finishing&#xD;
the sentence for him. "You have often seen me with the Em-&#xD;
press at the Palace !"&#xD;
" Will the senorita be seated? " said Colonel Lopez quickly,&#xD;
placing a chair ; " and will she let me know in what way I can&#xD;
serve her ? "&#xD;
"Colonel Lopez can do nothing for me," replied Inez, resting&#xD;
her hand upon the chair he had offered, " save to have the&#xD;
goodness to be seated himself ; and I beg the favor of his atten-&#xD;
tion for a very few moments. I find myself here to-night," she&#xD;
continued, as Colonel Lopez complied with her request, and&#xD;
resumed .his chair by the table, " to fulfil a sacred duty. My&#xD;
aunt and myself leave Mexico forever, for Spain, in a very&#xD;
few days; but I could not go without performing the last trust&#xD;
I hold in charge for another ; and as our route to Vera Cruz&#xD;
brings us to Puebla, I find it convenient to deliver to 'night, in&#xD;
person, the message I hold for Colonel Lopez."  -&#xD;
"1A message for me, sefiorita ? and you come from -- ? "&#xD;
" Querataro!" said Inez, slowly and solemnnly.&#xD;
The word startled the listener, as if " murder " had been&#xD;
&#xD;
whispered in his ear ; but turning his head from her earnest&#xD;
gaze, he answered with an effort at ease.: "And who of my&#xD;
good friends has been kind enough to rememember me ? "&#xD;
" Remember you, Colonel Lopez ? "said Inez, with a touch of&#xD;
sarcasm. "Does Colonel Lopez think he will ever be forgot-&#xD;
ten ? Yes," she added after a pause ; " the message is from one&#xD;
who was your good friend, Colonel Lopez, to the last; and,&#xD;
though his lips are sealed now in the siLence of a grave which&#xD;
you gave to him, yet I speak for him to-night. Your Emperor,&#xD;
Colonel Lopez, and your friend, when he stood in the sunlight&#xD;
of the morning, upon the plain of Querataro, his noble head&#xD;
uncovered, and his flashing eyes looking heroically into the&#xD;
faces of the messengers of Death, cried out in the greatness of&#xD;
of his soul, to some lover of justice, to " tell Lopez, I forgive&#xD;
him ! " Through the month that has passed since the Emperor&#xD;
Maximilian has been numbered with the dead; I have borne&#xD;
these words as a trust sacredly reposed. I bring them to you&#xD;
to-night; more godlike than any that mortal lips have uttered&#xD;
since the Holy Christ on the cross prayed, "Father, forgive&#xD;
them!"   Take them, Colonel Lopez; and if there is a place in&#xD;
your heart pure enough to receive them, keep them there, and&#xD;
prize them!!"&#xD;
Lopez had bowed his head upon his hands, so that Inez could&#xD;
not see the pallor that had crept into his face. As she drew the&#xD;
picture of the Emperor's death-scene, and as she ceased speak-&#xD;
ing now, a groan of anguish escaped him.&#xD;
" And have you too come to taunt me ? "he exclaimed, with-&#xD;
out raising his head ; " would that I had never heard the name&#xD;
of Maximilian of Austria ! "&#xD;
" Would that he had never seen Miguel Lopez ! "exclaimed&#xD;
Inez warmly. "The Emperor Maximilian has gone to his&#xD;
grave, proudly, nobly, heroically, wrapped in a mantle of great-&#xD;
ness ; and he has left behind a name that shall be kept green&#xD;
in the hearts of those who love chivalry and honor! But re-&#xD;
member, Colonel Lopez, that you have sold from yourself all&#xD;
but life; your earth-destiny is crowned. When History shall&#xD;
write the names coupled with black dishonor, whose is it shall&#xD;
form a trinity with those of Iscariot and Arnold ! - whose, but&#xD;
Miguel Lopez'! And think you, when, the Republicans hold&#xD;
high revel over poor bleeding Mexico, they shall remember the&#xD;
traitor that gave it to them ? Taunt thee, Colonel Lopez ? No,&#xD;
o    I have come, not only in the name of the martyred dead,&#xD;
but in that of Justice, and Liberty, whom thou hast, sorely&#xD;

wounded, to tell thee the ru  ; to tell thee thy race is run ; to&#xD;
tell thee, there is a voice  shall ceaselessly sound a "memento&#xD;
mori " in thy ears; to t  hee, the Emperor shall be avenged !"&#xD;
Inez's words were d ep and earnest, and as the last sentence&#xD;
rang out in the sile e, the guilty man, who had almost cowered&#xD;
before h r,  rte up from his bent posture.&#xD;
" Girl, you a e mad ! " he exclaimed wildly ; "you have not&#xD;
come here to do this deed!"&#xD;
For a moment he looked earnestly into her face; and then,&#xD;
as he noted the quiet calmness on her features, he shrank&#xD;
before her. There was a dignity, a holiness about her, that&#xD;
awed him ; and the cutting truthfulness of her words stabbed&#xD;
already the life from his heart-&#xD;
Inez spurned with contempt the craven before her ; in spite of&#xD;
herself, it crept into her voice and words, as she answered,-&#xD;
"I-kill -thee, Miguel Lopez? I would not kill the worm&#xD;
in my pathway. You mistake; it is thy Conscience, that shall&#xD;
lash thee into the grave ; it is thy0Conscience that shall make&#xD;
thee hate life ; it is thy Conscience and thy Memory, that shall&#xD;
conjure before thee in the night-time, 'shadows and forms that&#xD;
shall make thee tremble more than ten thousand of earth in bat-&#xD;
tle array.!'&#xD;
" If thou wouldst drink of the Lethean waters, know that&#xD;
there is no virtue in that magic stream for de ds like thine.&#xD;
I kill thee ?" continued Inez, with strange, solemn eloquence.&#xD;
" Nay nay! these hands; that have closed the dead Empe-&#xD;
ror's eyes, -this weary heart, that would have given its life-&#xD;
blood to have seen its poor country blessed with such a ruler,&#xD;
they are consecrated now to higher, holier deeds. I can go to&#xD;
the Holy Order at Madrid now, with a soul given up to God !&#xD;
for my last mission in Mexico, in the world, is accomplished.&#xD;
I leave thee to. thy Conscience, thy Memory, - and thy God.&#xD;
Farewell, - till we both meet the Emperor before the Eternal&#xD;
Throne ! ".&#xD;
Her long black dress swept across the oaken floor ; and&#xD;
Colonel Lopez was alone again..&#xD;
He started from his chair, and looked wildly about him, as&#xD;
one coming suddenly face to. face with the light; and then&#xD;
began again that restless treading to and fro ; his brow con-&#xD;
tracted, his eyes bent upon the -floor, his hand now and then&#xD;
passed through the masses of hair that fell over his forehead,&#xD;
and again pressed upon his side, as if to stop the painful&#xD;
throbbing of the heart within.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miguel Lopez seemed to struggle with some terrible resolu-&#xD;
tion that he was forming with himself. Now he stopped before&#xD;
the arched window, threw open the casement, and through the&#xD;
interlacing tendrils of the ivy looked out upon the night; an&#xD;
again, he would turn suddenly away, and resume his walk. At&#xD;
last he paused before the escritoire, and taking from his pocket&#xD;
a small key, placed it in the lock. Doubtingly he stood for&#xD;
some moments, turning it back and forth; and then, with sud-&#xD;
den nerve, he opens;it, and reveals a set of drawers and little&#xD;
partitions. He touches a secret spring, and a tiny door is&#xD;
opened within, and hurriedly he takes out a small vial, and&#xD;
seizing a wine-glass that stands upon the table, he pours out a&#xD;
few drops of the liquid and raises it to his lips. He hesitates&#xD;
and holds it up between himself and the light. It is ver&#xD;
little; and yet Death lurks therein. "What is his life now but&#xD;
a continued dishonor and disgrace? Gods ! he will rid him-&#xD;
self of it ! He will be forgotten; they shall say Lopez was&#xD;
brave enough to take his own life; there is some honor in&#xD;
that ! "&#xD;
Again he raises the glass, with its dark contents, to his lips;&#xD;
turns it higher -is he brave enough to die ?  An instant more,&#xD;
and there is a ,ringing sound of shivered crystal as the glass&#xD;
strikes the floor, and the dark liquid is in drops upon the oaken&#xD;
graining.&#xD;
"No, no !" exclaimed the wretched man, as he staggered to&#xD;
the chair near the table. "I cannot do it ! I could meet an&#xD;
angry God; but I dare not, -cannot look into the  ale face&#xD;
of the man whose blood is n my hands! Cursed be the hour&#xD;
that I listened to the voice of Temptation ! Cursed be the hour&#xD;
that gave me birth; and cursed be the gold that damned me! "&#xD;
Great drops of moisture stood upon his brow. He bent his&#xD;
head in agony upon the table. The moments and the hours of&#xD;
the night-time passed unheeded. The lamp went out, and&#xD;
the moonlight streamed in upon him through the open window,&#xD;
and the only sound that anon broke the midnight silence was&#xD;
the piteous wail from a traitor's heart, -.&#xD;
"God help me! Ashamed to live, and afraid to die ! God&#xD;
help me, God help me !"&#xD;
"So writhes the mind remorse hath riven,&#xD;
Unfit for earth, undoomed forheaven;&#xD;
Darkness above, despair beneath;&#xD;

CHAPTER LI.&#xD;
OFTLY, over the turreted roof of the old Spanish con.&#xD;
vent, whose towers are greened with the mossy touch&#xD;
of age, and on whose stony walls the clinging ivy&#xD;
creeps upward with the creeping years, fall the quiet&#xD;
moonbeams; and beyond the misty -valley and the dew-covered&#xD;
hills, gleam the spires and towers of the Spanish capital.&#xD;
The world is at rest, and all is peace, save when the deep-&#xD;
toned convent bell sends forth, from hour to hour, to those that&#xD;
wake and watch, the solemn message that" Father Time is pass-&#xD;
ing onward to Eternity.! "&#xD;
The lights in the convent have all been extinguished. The&#xD;
last prayer of the most devoted worshiper has been sent up;&#xD;
the latest lingerer has left the little chapel, stolen noiselessly&#xD;
through the dark corridors, and, with an atmosphere'about sanc-&#xD;
tified by prayer, sleeps in holy calm.&#xD;
But there is one in this sacred place who has not yet heard&#xD;
the voice that, with its whisper, " Peace ! be still," is to bring&#xD;
the great calm o'er the troubled waters of her soul.&#xD;
High above the sleeping earth, the Sister Agatha throws&#xD;
open the latticed window of her little cell, and leaning upon the&#xD;
stone casement, looks forth upon the night, listening to the&#xD;
sound of the midnight bell.&#xD;
Does cloister-life, with.its freedom from contact with the world,&#xD;
and its distr ting influences, rid the soul of all earthliness,&#xD;
the heart ofil humanity?  Does the taking of holy vows give&#xD;
to the heaven-bound pilgrim power to yield all fears and&#xD;
hopes, break all human ties, and change all human into divine&#xD;
love?  Is life within those holy walls an earnest of heaven,.&#xD;
filled- with sanctified devotion and beatific consecration?&#xD;
Surely dod does not grant such divine peace even to those who&#xD;
give their life to His service. Earth-life must be ever the&#xD;
same; and while this "mortal coil " hangs about the soul, so&#xD;
long must it be visited however fenced around with goodness&#xD;
and religion, by the griefs and woes, the thoughts and fancies,&#xD;
akin to its humanity; and doubtless in the long years of life&#xD;
&#xD;
given to sacred duty within monastic walls, there are hours, it&#xD;
may be of sunlight, or at twilight,'when the soul's brightness is&#xD;
clouded by the mist of earth-memories, and the thoughts steal&#xD;
away,-&#xD;
" To dreadful wastes, where footless fancies dwell&#xD;
Among the fragments of the golden day."&#xD;
As the Sister 'Agatha sits by the open window of her cell,&#xD;
her hands clasped before her, the folds of her long veil half-&#xD;
shadowing her face, the spirit of rest seems to *ander. farther&#xD;
from her; and leaning her head against the stone casement as&#xD;
the last sound of the bell dies away, she gives herself upato the&#xD;
memories that link her to the past.&#xD;
Her past ?  Ah ! few golden days had been given to her !&#xD;
What had her life been?  A dream -a cheat -a bitter, bitter&#xD;
mockery !&#xD;
It had been two months since she and Anita had left Mexico.&#xD;
Only two short months! and yet it seemed as many years since&#xD;
she had placed the wreath of ivy and laurel -the lastiribute&#xD;
that should ever rest upon the tomb of the ope whom slie had&#xD;
loved with all the strength of her soul. She saw it now -that&#xD;
crypt, where Victor Isolani sleeps. It had. been her trial task&#xD;
to leave it, yet broken-spirited, crushed, and broken-hearted,&#xD;
with all her idols shattered before her, she had. given that up&#xD;
too. The stars in the Mexican sky would watch as tenderly as&#xD;
those that shone over the hills of the Tyrol; qnd the trump&#xD;
that should call the dead, would reach him there, just as surely&#xD;
as it would burst the sepulchre that held his ancestors; and&#xD;
though the sea should roll between them here, in heaven they&#xD;
would not be divided. The Emperor would be brought back&#xD;
to the Fatherland, and- rest among the Hapsburgs; but Inez&#xD;
Gonzales left her dead resting where he had given his all.&#xD;
They had crossed the ocean, she and. Anita; and she had&#xD;
thought to make pilgrimage to Miramar before coming to Madrid;&#xD;
had thought to look upon the face of her beloved Empress once&#xD;
more in life; had thought it possible to say some word that&#xD;
might call back the wandering fancy and wake up the sleeping&#xD;
memory; but when she touched the shores of the Old World,&#xD;
and heard how heavily God had laid his hand upon her, her&#xD;
courage failed. It would be no use, and she shrank from the trial.&#xD;
She could 'not -she would not, see her. Empress, her friend,&#xD;

Mexico, lying low, blighted and drooping, a bruised reed that&#xD;
did not 'lift its head.&#xD;
So she and A.iita had come at once to Madrid, where there&#xD;
was a brother well advanced in years, and many friends who&#xD;
had not forgotten Auita, and who gave to Inez a welcome for&#xD;
the sake of the proud Spanish blood that flowed, in her&#xD;
veins.&#xD;
At Madrid, Anita made her last effort to win her back to&#xD;

that her mission was ended. All joy and hope had been killed&#xD;
out of life for her, and she yearned to find the rest for her soul&#xD;
that she believed came to those who walk in the paths of right-&#xD;
eousness; and in accordance with her Catholic belief, to wear the&#xD;
habit ofa Sister of Mercy was a high and holy privilege.&#xD;
.Only a few weeks since, in the dark, vaulted chapel, before its&#xD;
marble altar, with its suffering Christ, over which the burning&#xD;
tapers threw a halo of light, before bishops and priests, in the&#xD;
presence of the holy Sisters, and the many that came out from&#xD;
Madrid to witness the ceremony, Inez had taken the holy vows&#xD;
and assumed the penitential garb of a Sister of Mercy. Shem&#xD;
said adieu to the pomps and vanities of the world, and goes forth&#xD;
now, as Sister Agatha, only on- missions of mercy, " to lift up&#xD;
those that do fall, to comfort and strengthen the weak-hearted,&#xD;
to minister to the sick and wounded, whether in mind or&#xD;
body."&#xD;
She is not yet strong herself. Each day, there are battles&#xD;
fought with - and not always victories won, over - her owl.&#xD;
soul. The dark-robed Sisters look strangely and wonderingly, as&#xD;
the Sister Agatha passes to and fro; and, as they catch the worn,&#xD;
weary expression of the dark, lustrous eyes, those who know too&#xD;
well th$ glance of orrow, have no need to hear the story of a&#xD;
blighted life. Thefhave felt, too,, in the "long ago," the cruel&#xD;
prickings of the thorns in the dusty paths of the world, and&#xD;
turned, as this young Sister, into the shade, to wait the Master's&#xD;
coming.&#xD;
There is one older and more loving than the rest, - the Sister&#xD;
Stanislaus, who, as she passes the novice at twilight, in the long&#xD;
corridor, sometimes stops to greet her; and once she had pushed&#xD;
aside the Sister Agatha's veil, and, as they two stood alone,&#xD;
pressed a kiss upon her brow, and whispered. softly, -&#xD;
" Patience, child I only a little longer here, and the rest will&#xD;
come!"&#xD;

The Sister Agatha sits by the open -,window,' listening&#xD;
to the set, slow bell, that, is ever tolling -in her heart. She&#xD;
feels that before her life is truly given to her ,God, -before the&#xD;
service that' she offers can be acceptable to Him, these mem-&#xD;
ories must be given up,- these.repinings, this clinging to the&#xD;
sweet remembrance of a human love, must pass. And yet it is&#xD;
hard; hard, that she has left Victor- Iso1  ' behind, and now&#xD;
must put him out. of her heart. The tears fall thick' and fast&#xD;
upon her dark dress, her head droops upon the clasped hands,&#xD;
and in broken utterance she iurmurs her last prayer for him,&#xD;
as she gives up:his face, his voice, his memory.&#xD;
" 0 Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, grant&#xD;
him eternal rest!"&#xD;
- She has sunk upon her knees, and-the moonbeams rest upon&#xD;
her bowed figure. There is a long,-tearful silence, wherein the&#xD;
Sister Agatha wrestles with her own soul, as Israel of old with&#xD;
the Angel of Lord.&#xD;
There is but One from whom strength cometh ; and lifting he-&#xD;
eyes, at last, towards the Heaven= where He dwelleth,- hungry&#xD;
for God, hungry for rest and peace, she pours forth her anguish&#xD;
before Him, in the passionate cry that He will not forget her,&#xD;
unworthy though she be.&#xD;
"The shadows of the convent towers&#xD;
Slant down the sniowy sward,&#xD;
Still creeping with the creeping hours&#xD;
That lead me to my Lord.&#xD;
Break up the heavens, 0 Lord i and far&#xD;
Thro' all you starlight keen,&#xD;
Draw me, thy bride, a glittering star,&#xD;
In raiment white and clean I"&#xD;
Unheard and unseen, the Angel of Mercy hovers above the&#xD;
weeping suppliant., Tenderly he wipes the tears from her eyes,&#xD;
and breathes into her soul, the "peace that passeth all ,under-&#xD;
standing."&#xD;
Obediently, humbly, and .faithfully will the Sister Agatha&#xD;
- walk in the appointed path, waiting and watching, and when&#xD;
the Death-Angel is seen in the distance, gladly will she rise up&#xD;
and go forth to meet him, and lay her burden down at-his&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
The Kaiserstadt, the Imperial Capital of the Austrian Em&#xD;
perors, has wakened-to a day of mourning.&#xD;
-Still, calm, andzplaeid, the morning air is undisturbed. Light&#xD;
fleecy clouds float lazily and dreamily across the blue sky, and-&#xD;

the hush of the Sabbath pervades the streets usually so animated.&#xD;
The frosts of Autumn have not yet chilled the flowers; nor&#xD;
deadened, the leaves that make the Prater cheerful, and yet but&#xD;
few wander through those winding paths that we have seen so&#xD;
crowded.&#xD;
The proud hearts of the Viennese are filled with sorrow;' and&#xD;
as they move solemnly about, they exchange grief-speaking&#xD;
glances that say, "Comes he thus, my friend ! comes he thus ! "&#xD;
Yes, he has come ! Their Prince, who, but a few years since,&#xD;
went out from their midst, a crown upon his noble brow, and&#xD;
his heart swelling with mingled pride and hope, has been&#xD;
brought back to them, murdered out of the world by those to&#xD;
whom he would have given the labor of his life.&#xD;
The friend of his youth, the companion of his seaman's life,&#xD;
Admiral Tegethoff, had waited with his ship in the Mexican&#xD;
waters, until Humanity found voice among the conquerors of&#xD;
Mexico ; and had borne the body of his Prince, yielded at last&#xD;
by Mexican magnanimity, across the. sea. For three days, the&#xD;
body had lain in state at the grand Cathedral of St. Stephen's;&#xD;
and to-day, the requiem mass is to be offeed for the repose of&#xD;
his soul; and then. forever done with the things of earth, with&#xD;
all his dreams of greatness, Maximilian of Austria, the noble&#xD;
Prince, the Christian ruler, the hero, will be laid beside his*&#xD;
ancestors, to moulderinto dust.&#xD;
From the balconies and windows that erst proclaimed, by&#xD;
gay adornings, the bridal of their Prince, are waving now the&#xD;
sombre hangings that tell of grief and woe ; while sadly and&#xD;
solemnly tolling, the bells of the Great Cathedral are echoed&#xD;
from'the lesser belfries; and the invisible, yet all-pervading&#xD;
Spirit of Sadness whispers in tones that are borne around and&#xD;
adown the quiet streets, "Come to prayer!"&#xD;
Dourner,, divest thy heart of private grief: Sybarite, forget&#xD;
the world its luxuries, its pleasures; leave behind its baubles,&#xD;
its bravado, its blazonry,-and come to prayer !&#xD;
Ambition, put away thy dreams of glory and renown; call&#xD;
back 1hy fancy from the glittering, cheating vision of a future&#xD;
that shall never come ; hush.the syren voice of Fame, and come&#xD;
to pray beside the bier of Honor, Truth, and Fidelity!1&#xD;
Maiden, wife, mother, 'stay the 'beatings of thy happy heart,&#xD;
and come to pray for the heart-crushed, brain-weary, desolate&#xD;
widow at Miramar;. who, through the long years' that are to&#xD;
conie floating on-the sea of Time, shall calling vain, shall watch&#xD;
in vain, for the coming of'the one who in life held' her mind,&#xD;
&#xD;
her heart, her soul. God be m reiful unto her, and keep her&#xD;
under the shadow of His wing !&#xD;
They have gathered in the  reat Cathedral; high and lw,&#xD;
rich and poor; a       ops. and priests, in saintly robes;&#xD;
the royal fath , and the mourning mother, who had seen&#xD;
their Spartan he o brought back dead, yet borne upon a shield&#xD;
with proudest 'cription that ever testified to the renown of&#xD;
a Hapsburg; the Imperial brother, who, as he sits before the&#xD;
upraised catafalque, whereon, glittering through the heavy&#xD;
wreaths of funereal cedar, lies the crown that should never more&#xD;
press his brow, the sword so: heroically wielded on the Aztee&#xD;
plains, useless now, --as the subdued softening rays of; the em-&#xD;
purpling sun light up the ,golden cross, and the towering wax-&#xD;
lights feebly flicker o'er the whole -Francis Joseph remembers&#xD;
the brother before him, as the companion of his boyish days,&#xD;
the Maximilian of his youth, the noble, trusting :spirit that&#xD;
was bound by cords of cable strength to his own; thinks of him&#xD;
then, and thinks of him now, extended within that catafalque,&#xD;
in a calm and lifeless sleep, from which naught but the trump&#xD;
of the Archangel will rouse him,-he bows' his Imperial head,&#xD;
and cries out in his soul, in voiceless agony, the same bitter&#xD;
words,-" Comes he. thus ! comes he thus! "&#xD;
Softly, softly through the aisles and chancel, into the lofty&#xD;
nave, steal the resonant sounds of the organ; now swelling and&#xD;
deepening, and rising in heavenly melody, now softening into&#xD;
a wail as piteous and despairing as the echo of the night-wind&#xD;
o'er the Eolian harp.&#xD;
If aught inanimate e'er grieves for the departed brave, it is&#xD;
the sound of music that wakes up that grief. The dirge-like&#xD;
notes of the requiem find their way to .hearts hardened and&#xD;
stony; and as the low tones of the "Miserere " fall upon the ear,&#xD;
pleading more powerfully than human voice can 'do, "Lord&#xD;
have mercy, Lord have mercy!"- eyes all unused to tears&#xD;
feel them welling up from the heart. As Moses struck the&#xD;
rock of old, and the healing waters came,,so at many a sunset&#xD;
hour, in the dusk and. gloom of some house of prayer, has the&#xD;
voice of the golden reeds found an echo in human hearts, tiat&#xD;
had well-nigh closed the door on all save spirits dark and evil;&#xD;
and that echo has rung ceaselessly, hauntingly, within the&#xD;
secret chambers, till the soul has shaken off the fetters. of Sis&#xD;
and risen up strong and true.&#xD;
The music, the. chanting, the prayers for the repose of thQ&#xD;
Prince Maximilian are ended. The people rise up; and as they&#xD;
