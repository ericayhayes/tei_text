PREFACE, BY THE AUTHORESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year of our Lord 1862, by&#xD;
ROWENA-GRANICE STEELE,&#xD;
in the Clerk's Office of the United States District Court for the Northern District&#xD;
of'"the State of California.&#xD;
&#xD;
In placing this little volume before the puWblic I have endeavored-as in. the-&#xD;
stories hitherto written by me-to bring a moral to' bear upon it; and if&#xD;
my writings are at all deserving, their sole merit lies in their simplicity. I1aving,&#xD;
m ingled much with the world,  with the different classes of which it is com-&#xD;
posed, I usually draw each e  acter fromreal life. When very young, I acted&#xD;
as tract distributor im the great city of New York. To me this occupation was a&#xD;
most pleasing one; for, being naturally of a communicative disposition, -I im-&#xD;
parted freely the history of my own life, and was often repaid by that of t&#xD;
listener in return. I also draw many truths a'nd conclusions from ny own&#xD;
4cekered and eventful life; especially when speaking of home-of a kind7&#xD;
loving mother, and pure, gentle, affectionate, confiding sisters-trials and strug-&#xD;
(de- with pride and poverty; these.ae old,. familiar scenes, and cling to me&#xD;
through all the vicimsitudes of life.&#xD;
1 have frequently heard-he renrk thar t an authoress," or, "blue-stocking,&#xD;
ai they sometimes call us, "should be shunned as a wife; that they are, as a&#xD;
general thing, slovernly and idle in their habits; " but-this is a mistaken.notion,&#xD;
I have had the pleasure of meeting Miss Grace Greenwood, Miss Jane Porter,&#xD;
Fanny Fern, and a number of other authoresses of greater or less celebrity, and&#xD;
I found them plain, neat, tidy, unpretending women, pleasing and lady-like in&#xD;
eonversation- and entirely free f:om  what is called "strong-mindedness" in&#xD;
women. As for myself, every piece I have written, (and they number about&#xD;
sixty,) was composed while engaged in domestic affairs. 'I have often laid down&#xD;
the dish-towel to take up my pen for the purpose of noting down an idea.; and&#xD;
at my leisure would gather up these disconnectedrideas ; and then, mmo1ing&#xD;

my real characters around me, weave them together, as we do the different&#xD;
colored flowers, when forming them into a boquet.&#xD;
The circumstances of the following story are true; that is, the suicide did&#xD;
actually take place on the New Jersey shore, opposite the City of New York.&#xD;
The eveMt, also the dreadful curse, I have 'no doubt, can be found upon the pages&#xD;
of old fles'of the New York HERALD, SUN, TRIBUNE, and other papdrs published&#xD;
about the year 1837-8.&#xD;
Hoping that this little offering will meet the approbation'of an intelligent&#xD;
public, it is submitted to its perusal with the desire that it will receive a general&#xD;
and critical examination,                                    R. G. S.&#xD;

And, if it come -not thence refin'd and pure,&#xD;
I'll be a bankrupt to thy hope, and heaven&#xD;
Shall shut its gates on me!"&#xD;
"And must you really go to-morrow, Nelson?" said Carrie- Dean,&#xD;
in a half ehildish voice, as if she would have it otherwise; "and must&#xD;
you really go?"&#xD;
"I must," answered the young man to whom these- words were&#xD;
addressed in such tender and loving tones. "To-morrow, you know,&#xD;
(arrie, I am twenty-one, and, as I have often told you, dearest, up to&#xD;
this moment, I am entirely ignorant of my parents and all circumstances&#xD;
connected with them-of my birth, their death or desertion, or, of any&#xD;
relative near or distant. My first recollections are of being obliged to&#xD;
takc a little basket on my arm and call at the basement doors of the&#xD;
rich and ask for cold vivtuals, through the pinching frosts and beating&#xD;
Ftoris of winter, and the scorching suns of summer; then retaining&#xD;

LEONNIE ST. JAMES; OR, THE SUICIDES CURSE&#xD;
embrace from  Mrs. Field, who 'was always over-the wash-tub, or&#xD;
ironing-table, when "the plague rheumathz," as she elled it, would&#xD;
permit her to stand. I once heard her say, as I sat crying in one corner,&#xD;
with a cold potato in my hand: 'Poor child, it is a shame that you&#xD;
should live so, and suffer with a poor old w~ooman like me, when he is&#xD;
surrounded with wealth and luxury.' "&#xD;
"Who, Aunty?" Ieagerly exclaimed; who do you mean ; what he?"&#xD;
" Did I say he?  Imeant th, 'ie rich nen, rho keep bigstores.&#xD;
and live in brick houses; you are as good as their children."&#xD;
" I looked at her for a, moment ; a new thought entered my childish&#xD;
brain, and I exclaimed: 'Who am I, Aunty? Did I ever have a&#xD;
father and mother?'"&#xD;
" For a moment she was silent. She stirred the fire; then throwing&#xD;
a few shavings upon the coals; said: - Nelsie, the chips are almost&#xD;
gone, and if you will go to the-ship'yard and get a basket full, I'llcook&#xD;
the nice little piece of corn-beef the lady gave you yesterday,. and some&#xD;
cabbage too.'"&#xD;
"I took the basket and left the house without murmuring my usnal&#xD;
childish "excuses.  That' thought, that, strange thought-who am&#xD;
I?'--still haunted my mind."&#xD;
"I reached the ship-yard andbegan filling my basket with the -chips.&#xD;
While thus engaged, a gentleman, holding a little boy about my own&#xD;
age by the hand, passed through the yard. I heard the child say:&#xD;
'Oh, father! see that poor little boy. Can't I give him nmy mittens:'&#xD;
.fis hands must be cold. See," he continued, 'I can 'put mine in my&#xD;
comforter,-or my pockets, but he has-to keep his in the cold all the&#xD;
time.'"&#xD;
"The gentleman approached me, and while the little 1)oy gave me&#xD;
the mittens, he asked, in kindly tones: 'Who are you, my little man ?'"&#xD;
" That was the question-' who was 1?' I-looked at him and answer-&#xD;
ed: 'I don't know, sir ; my name is Nelson Wardell. I live with&#xD;
aunty Field,. and she lives in the cellar kitchen of that old wooden&#xD;
house there, around the corner.'&#xD;
"' Is your mother and father dead??' continued the gentleman."&#xD;
"'I guess so,' I replied."&#xD;
Poor boy, poor boy,' he said, handing me a sixpence.  ie then&#xD;
left me, saying-' You must- be a good boy'"            .&#xD;
"1 looked at the sixpence and wished that I could buy aunty Field&#xD;
a new dress with it i and after thinking of fifty things that I shoul&#xD;
have liked to buy. I concluded to take it home and let aunty invest it&#xD;

LEONNIE ST. JAMES ; OR THE SUICIDE s CURSA.&#xD;
according to her own judgment."&#xD;
"Fron that morning I became a thinker, and have been thinking&#xD;
ever since-' who am I ?&#xD;
"To-morrow being my twenty-first birth-day, dear arri, the myte-&#xD;
rious curtain is to be drawn which has so long concealed from me&#xD;
all information of my birth and parentage. I expect," 'he said, with&#xD;
a merry laugh, " I shall turn out the son of some exiled nobleman, heir&#xD;
to an immense- fortune'; therefore, be patient, Catrie, dear, in a few&#xD;
days you shall know all."&#xD;
"I don't want to know more than I do," replied the, girl, in a half&#xD;
loving, half pettish tone. "I've known you ten years; and I know&#xD;
you to be a high-ninded, honest, industriousyoung man, whohas risen&#xD;
from errand-boy to head-clerk in my father's establishment. And as&#xD;
such, my father is willing that you should become his son-in-law. But&#xD;
,should you turn out to be a prince or some great titled foreigner, you&#xD;
might forget little Carrie Dean, who led you to her father's door one even-&#xD;
ing when she found you, sick and cold, wandering about the streets of&#xD;
Philadelphia, and marry a princess or lady of honor."&#xD;
Nlson Wardell looked up. A cloud rested -apon his usually placid&#xD;
countenance. At length he addressed his companion:&#xD;
"Carrie, those last words of yours re the only unkind ones I ever&#xD;
heard from your lips., To be reminded of my former . verty' and&#xD;
wretchedness, and your kind and heavenly, act of charity, does not&#xD;
wound my pride. But, to be suspected of fickleness; to he r you say.,&#xD;
'you fear I should forget you amid good fortune,' are wods unworthy&#xD;
of your noble, and usually high-minded nature, I will now be as un-&#xD;
generous as yourself. Suppose that I should turn out to be the son of&#xD;
dishonorable parents-that my father as a thief, a murderer,&#xD;
spending a felon's life within the walls of a prison; or, that my m-&#xD;
ther-"&#xD;
That sacred word died upon his Tips andhe burst into teark.&#xD;
Oh, stop ! stop! " cried Carrie, throwing her arms about his neck&#xD;
and kissing his high, proul forehead; "I did not intend to wound your&#xD;
sensitiv, nature.  Oh! I have done wrong  Forgive me, Nelson&#xD;
forgive me! Oh do not sob so ! IIt was a little foolish pang of girlish&#xD;
tealo usy which caused me to utter those unkind words. Oh, if you&#xD;
will forgive me this time, such a feeling shall never again enter my&#xD;
Nelson embraced her fondly and imprinted a kiss of forgiveness on&#xD;
her tear-bedewed cheek ; but he could not speak. The davt had entered&#xD;

Mr. Dean was not aware of the real object of Nelson 'Wardells visit               a long tim&#xD;
to New York, He gave him letters of introduction to many of tih                     canvas wa&#xD;
leading merchants of that city, and when he left, wished him a pleasant             Its lsIu&#xD;

As the cars left the depot, Carrie kissed her fingers to Nelson, and                Notwith&#xD;
with her cambric handkerchief waved him an adieu. Nelson watched                   'Wardell,&#xD;

gel face was that which smiled upon him from the ivory?  "Beautiful!&#xD;
beautiful !" he exclaimed,; " surely, this is not the picture of a human&#xD;
face ; 'tis but the product of the fertile imagination of some finished&#xD;
artist. Who is this ?" he inquired in eager tones, of Mrs..Field.&#xD;
"After you have learned her history, you shall know her name," she&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
Before twelve o'clock that night he was in possession of the, follow-&#xD;
ing details, gleaned from thematiuscript:&#xD;
"It was one of those bright, calm mornings in May; not a cloul&#xD;
rested. upon the face of the broad, blue heavens. The very air-without&#xD;
the aid of orange blossoms-seemed laden with sweets. The rich tint-&#xD;
ed pink and purple vapors floated in the _air just above the house-lops,&#xD;
and looked like garlands of bright flowers, twined and festooned by,&#xD;
angels' hands.&#xD;
"Such was the appearance of this lovely morning to the eye of the&#xD;
lover of the beautiful, even in the busy, bustling city of New York.&#xD;
.housamjs passed and repassed without heeding its beauty. They only&#xD;
saw the pavement upon which they trod; so busy were their iniuds&#xD;
with the subjects which occupied their thoughts. But the group of&#xD;
young girls sitting in the school-room of the Rutger Institute was not&#xD;
of the latter class. They were six in number--gay, light-hearted, and&#xD;
beautiful. But the most bright and beautiful among them was Leon-&#xD;
nie St. James. Tall and queenly in figure for one (of her years, with&#xD;
heavenly blue eyes, together with a rich musical voico, She was the&#xD;
last of th6 above mentioned group who arrived, and as she entered the&#xD;
school-room the others ran forward to meet her to give and receive the&#xD;
usual good-morning kiss.&#xD;
" Shall we walk out, or remain here until school time? " said Au-&#xD;
guAta Somers, another lovely girl. "We have it half hour to do just&#xD;
as we please in."&#xD;
",Oh ! let us walk, by all means," cried Minnio Trueman, a nymph&#xD;
with-roguish gray eyes. 'We will make quite a conspicuous appear-&#xD;
anco marching along two abreast a la miUlaire."&#xD;
This last remark drew forth a merry laugh from her companions.&#xD;
"0, come!" said Leonnie, "let us walk ; it will do uts good this&#xD;
lovely morning."&#xD;
I would rather not," said Efie Lane, a palo girl with large black&#xD;
eves and sylph-like form.&#xD;

All the girls gathered around ~flie to hear her answer.&#xD;
" I have felt unhappy," she said, "ever since I read the account of&#xD;
the dreadful suicide which took placQ last night."e&#xD;

"0, Yes, it is!" lied Minnie Trueman, while the rest of the girls&#xD;
looked the same sentiment.&#xD;
"What could have induced her to commit such a ras  a   wicked&#xD;

"It is supposed that she badbeen deceived bya. young man;" e&#xD;

"You wouldn't catch me drowning myse                       her&#xD;

pouting lip.&#xD;
" Nor I'1" exclaimed all except Leonnie St. James, whose eyes were&#xD;
cast upon the floor, as if chained there by a spell.h&#xD;
"Why, look at Leonnie" cried Minnie; "how serious she looks.&#xD;
Come, come, Leonnie, let us iear from your wise lips, what you would&#xD;
do, if a young man should gain your heart and then forsale you for&#xD;
another!"&#xD;
"Well," said Leonnie, and a deep, unconscious sigh escaped from&#xD;
her bosom. "As'I have no father or brother to fight a duel in protection&#xD;
my honor, I think that in such a case, I should bid good-by to the&#xD;
world, and&#xD;
" And what?" cried Minnie; "jump intothe river?"&#xD;

lighten us as to what you would do under such trying circumstances.&#xD;
It is well, perhaps, for us to think of these things, as we don't know&#xD;

over her childhood, had no children of their own. Neither did they&#xD;

party. A feeling of mutual love appeared to spring up between them&#xD;
at first sight. A friend of Leonnie's percieving the marked attention&#xD;
he paid her, and 'the pleasure those attentions seemed to give her,&#xD;
wvhisoered in her ear-" Beware of hiim, Leonnie, he is a heartless lib-&#xD;
ertine."  But Leounic heeded not the warning. She could not if she&#xD;
would. Her heart was gone-.-gone from her keeping forever, Philip&#xD;
Wardell was the possessor -of that unblemished gem.&#xD;
"'The next eveninrg after the party, he called at the residence of the&#xD;
Josselyns and inquired for Leonnie. He was shown to the parlor by a&#xD;
domestic. Instead of meeting the sweet smile of Leonnie, he met the&#xD;
stern eye of her guardian, who thus addressed him:&#xD;
"Mr. Wardell, you are an unwelcome visitor at this house. Leontie&#xD;
is my ward.. I love her as a ehild; arid I would not have her despoiled&#xD;
of her parity and virtue by subh a heartlesslibertine as you have pro-&#xD;
ed yourself to be. I know more of your doings than you are aware of,&#xD;
so be gone, and never enter mny door again!"&#xD;
"Burning with anger and insulted pride, Philip left the house mut--&#xD;
tering nurses,&#xD;
X Yes, old man," he said, " I will be revenged i I will plcktyour&#xD;
lovely flower, and Nhen I have blighted its freshness will cast it with-&#xD;
ering at your feet. I'll teach you to insult a gentleman's son.~&#xD;
" After thus unceremoniously dismissing young Wardiell, he summon-&#xD;
ed Leonnie to his study. 'Come, Leonnie he said, 'and sit in this&#xD;
chair beside me' The trembling-girl obeyed. ' Yoiiknow,'he began,&#xD;
' that Mrs.. Josselyn and myself have loved you as well as though you&#xD;
had been our own child. We have done all in our humble power to&#xD;
make your home pleasant; and you have well repaid~ us for our pains&#xD;
by yielding obediently to all our wishes. And now that the trying&#xD;
hour has come, I trust that you wil take our advice  He then related&#xD;
what had taken place between himself an *Piip, and also told her his&#xD;
true character.&#xD;
"Loonnie listened, and when he had finished, she wiped the tears&#xD;
from her eyes and said: 'Friend, father, I will try to do as you wish&#xD;
-forget him ; but oh, it would have been so sweet to have loved hims&#xD;
Still, I will promise never to speak to him; or at least not to listen to&#xD;
hi1s words- of love.' 'And this simple-mninded, inexperienced girl&#xD;
intended to keep her promise. -But, alas!i poor unsuspecting Leonnie,&#xD;
she knew not the wiles and snares that woild be set by the heartless&#xD;
betrayer to entrap her-the tems aions that would beset her on every&#xD;

side. She knew not the honeyed words that would be breathed in her&#xD;
ear. She had yet to learn how delicious was the draught of first lov(e,&#xD;
or how impossible to resist the gentle influence of the practiced deceiver&#xD;
who had two points to gain-her love, that he might toy with her while&#xD;
the charm lasted, and revenge upon the old man, who had insulted&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"On the following morning, as Leonnie was passing on her way to&#xD;
school, to her great surprise, she met Wardell. It was with half regret&#xD;
half pleasure that she returned the warm greeting he gave her.. Tie&#xD;
sorrowful, heart-broken look which he had assumed, a"d the sad tone&#xD;
of voice in which he addressed her had awakened in her a feeling of&#xD;
sympathy for him,&#xD;
"'One point gained,' he murmured, with a smile of satisfdaction, as&#xD;
he left her. ' Gain a girl's sympathy and you are sure of her love.'&#xD;
"4Ere he left her he received a promise from her to' meet him that&#xD;
evening on her return from school. Thus for week they met clan&#xD;
detinely.&#xD;
"On the evening following the morning on which the conversation&#xD;
regarding theasicide in te school-room took place, Leonnie had pro-&#xD;
mised Wardell to go to the minister's to get married; and it was the&#xD;
knowledge of.this which caused her to look so-sad upon that occasion.&#xD;
Sil she felt that there could be no artifice or deception used towards&#xD;
No, no;' she soliloquized, 'there is-no falsehood in the nature of&#xD;
Philip. ie, has never spoken a disrespectable word to me. Ile desires&#xD;
to make me his wife, and my heart tells me that a life of happiness&#xD;
awaits me if I consent. If not I must be miserable, for I can never&#xD;
love, another.'&#xD;
"Alas! the love of woman! It is known&#xD;
To be a lovely and a fearful thing;&#xD;
For all of theirs upon that die is thrown.&#xD;
And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring&#xD;
To them but mockeries of the past."&#xD;
When the school closed for the day, Leonnie made an excuse to her&#xD;
companions for taking an opposite direction from the one she usually&#xD;
took on her return home. After bidding them goad.by she walked ra-&#xD;
pidly for about five squars. At the corner of a small alley crossing&#xD;
Grand street she saw .a carriage, waiting, and as she approached the&#xD;
driver dismounted and opened the door. The next moment she was&#xD;
seated beside the idol of her heart-Philip Wardell, and riding at a -&#xD;
rapid rate down the street; The curtains of the carriage were closely&#xD;

ruined, and will not return to me a beggar. I will go to the city and&#xD;
seek him out. I'll tell him that I am no longer a school girl, but a&#xD;
woman, with a woman's heart; that I will share his poverty   that t1&#xD;
will leave this pretty cottage, where we have spent so many happy&#xD;
hours; this little parAdise where you, my boy, first saw the light of&#xD;
day and received your father's ivarm kiss of welcome. Yes, I will&#xD;
give-up all, I can take a little school in the city, and make enough to&#xD;
keep a neat, comfortable room for Philip"; and when he sees how light-&#xD;
hearted I am, he will bheer up, and fortune may smile again. I would&#xD;
go to-night, but the snow is falling so fast tha't I fear little Nelsie would&#xD;
take cold. I feel as if I could fly. I could pass over to the avenue and&#xD;
get into the stage, but I have not got a sfipence, for I spent the Lst&#xD;
few pennies I.had this morning for bread and milk for Nelsie. I won-,&#xD;
der if there is enough left for his breakfast.' She then arose and laid&#xD;
the sleeping child in his crib, and with a mother's caution she hastened&#xD;
to the cupboard to see how the bread and milk held 'out. 'I am very&#xD;
hungry,' she sighed, as she lifted a smallipait'of a loaf, 'but I must&#xD;
not taste this. No, I will not ,ob my child. Now, if Philip should&#xD;
come, what would I do? Ie would want sonie supper. O, if he only&#xD;
would come ! I could toast the bread, and warm the milk and throw it-&#xD;
over.. le likes milk-toast. But then there is no butter. 0, well, he&#xD;
could get along without butter foi once.'"&#xD;
"Poor teonnie, for it was she, would rob har babe for that heartless&#xD;
mian, and yet would not taste a crumb, to appease her own hunger.&#xD;
'More angel she, and he the blacker devil!' -Hugry and almost&#xD;
heart-broken, she retired to her bed. One thought cheered her; and&#xD;
that was of starting to the city in the morning, and the hope of finding&#xD;
her husband. At length she slept but it was not that sweet, undi1&#xD;
turbed, refreshing stimber of other days. At an early hour in tho&#xD;
morning, she was awakened by the sweet voice of little Nelsie, calling&#xD;
'Mama, mama, Nelsie cold.'"&#xD;
"She arose, and to her sorrow and astonishment, saw that the snow&#xD;
was still falling. She felt that it would be impossible for her to reach&#xD;
the city with'her childin her arms in her weak state of health. Just&#xD;
then a note from her little pet Canary bird fell upon her ear. 'Poor,&#xD;
little thing,' she said, 'you to, will starve.' Then placing the cage&#xD;
upon the table,-she began to make a fire, which soon was blazing cheer.,&#xD;
fully in the grate. She then warmed the milk and fed Nelsie, and aftei'&#xD;
kissing him twenty times, while the tears stole down her cheeks, shie&#xD;
said to him :&#xD;

Will Nelsie be good and not go to the fire optil mama comes back ?&#xD;
S' Yes,' he replied, in lisping accents, 'Nelsie good boy, maMa, bring&#xD;
Nvlsie candy?'&#xD;
"She threw a shawl about her, and taking up the cage, left the cot-&#xD;
tage. A short distance up the road stood a small shanty, in which&#xD;
lived an Irish family, w4ho gained a living by retailing cheap liquors,&#xD;
tobacco, and a few coarse groceries, such as cod-fish, mouldy ham, ,poor&#xD;
tea, and dark brown sugar. The only article fit for a person: to eat&#xD;
was the Irish potatoes. To this shanty Leonnie bent her steps. When&#xD;
she arrived she met a hearty welcome from the fat, good-:natured inis-&#xD;
tress.ta&#xD;
I have come,' she said, 'to ask yoU to give me a little milk, a loaf&#xD;
of bread, and a few potatoes for this bird and cage. The bird cost ten&#xD;
dollars,,and the cage seven, and I will be glad to get two dollars worth&#xD;
of provisions for them.'"&#xD;
" The wonian spoke kindly, and invited her to sit down by the&#xD;
fire. ,Sure,' said she, 'I have no use for the pretty thing, bu" I will&#xD;
let vow have the things you want; and if you want to sell the bird and&#xD;
(age, my old man is going to the city this morning, and he will sell it&#xD;
for you.&#xD;
"'Very well,' replied Leonnie, 'that will do; but please give me&#xD;
the things, for I left my babe, and I am afraid that it will get into the&#xD;
fire'&#xD;
&#xD;
"The bread, potatoes and milk were made ready. 'Come,' said the&#xD;
old lady, 'lc me fix you a nice little warm-drink,,fo,r faith, an' it's&#xD;
hard weather.&#xD;
" Leonnic accepted the offer, and took a drink of Irish whisky punch,&#xD;
which the woman declared was from her own private bottle, and then&#xD;
started for the cottage. There she found little Nelsie safe, and soundly&#xD;
sleeping upon the carpet. That day passed, and still no tidings from&#xD;
Philip."&#xD;
'1Oh !' she exclaimed as she gazed upon the golden sunset, which&#xD;
scorned to be smiling a good-night to the snow-covered hills ; Oh! if&#xD;
it is 'Clear in the morning, I will start for the city. I can get a few&#xD;
pennies from the woman at the shanty on the cage and bird."'&#xD;
"At this moment she heard a knock at the door. She hastened to&#xD;
open it, and as she did so, she saw standing there the husband of her&#xD;
Irish friend."&#xD;
"'I have come,' he said, 'to pay you the balance due you on that&#xD;
bird and cage you left with my wife this morning. I tried to sell it for&#xD;

"The man took the money, and soon returned with the above-men-&#xD;
tioned articles. When it was prepared, she sat down to her lonely&#xD;
meal, and soon after retired to bed. When she arose in the morning&#xD;
the sun'was shining. After dressing hers,.f and child and partaking&#xD;
of a scanty meal, she took Nelsie in her arms and crossed over to the&#xD;
avenue. There she entered an omnibus and yi-oceedd4to the city.&#xD;
She knelv not the- street or number of her husband's place of business.&#xD;
and after wandering around for some time, she at length thought of a&#xD;
directory, inwhgich she found the desired information. His business,&#xD;
place was No. -, Maiden Lane. To this place she proceeded, not ex-&#xD;
pecting to-find him ; only hoping to hear from him. Judge of her joy&#xD;
and surprise upon-opening the store door to behold him in conversation&#xD;
with a gentleman who seemed about to buy something. There was an&#xD;
old.gentleman and two younger ones seated at the back part of the&#xD;
store. - As soon as Philip saw'her he said to the gentlemen:&#xD;
Excuse me a moment, until I see what the lady ,Wants.' He ap-&#xD;
4proached her, and she read in his looks-- be silent.&#xD;
"lHe bent down and said to her: 'Go to the Pearl Street house. I&#xD;
'Will meet you there in half an hour.'"&#xD;
"Without replying, or even a look of reproach, she left and wenv&#xD;
directly to thehouse designated."&#xD;
At the appointed hour he came; but not the fond affectionate lover&#xD;
and husband of other days. His first words were/:&#xD;
Why have you followed me, and how dare you come to the- store?-&#xD;
I have told you that I did not wish my father to see you, or know any-&#xD;
thing of imy secret marriage.'"&#xD;
"At these cruel words Leonnie burst into tears. She couTd not speak.&#xD;
Little Nelsie crowed and laughed at his father; but the hardened wretch&#xD;
took no notice of his childish' prattle. At length Leonnie recovered&#xD;
her self-possession sufficiently to speak, and said:&#xD;

0, yes,' said Leonnie, 'you have been vey kind.'"&#xD;
le then handed her three dollars, one of which she insisted upon&#xD;
his taking in payment for his trouble."&#xD;
"'Divil a ha'porth will I take of It. If there is anything you want&#xD;

'Well, I shall not take the trouble to kill you, andrun the risk of&#xD;

idolize her, I cannot tell."&#xD;
Here,' he said, handing her a ten-dollar bill, 'take this; it will&#xD;
keep you and the young one until you find some one to befriend you.'"&#xD;
"'Oh, Philip!' she groaned, in tones of the deepestagony; 'if you&#xD;
-no longer love me; if I, whom you once loved to,' caress and fondle&#xD;
with, have become hateful to you, don't desert your child, and cast him&#xD;
froin you forever.'",&#xD;

so sure of-that;- it's just as likely to be another's.'"&#xD;
"Leonnie sprang towards him with the fierceness of a' tress. He&#xD;
had aroused a other's pi'ide-insulted a woman's truth."&#xD;
"'Philip Wardell,' she said, 'take back those last words, or I will&#xD;
kill you!'"&#xD;
"She had snatched a large China pitcher from the table a she&#xD;
advanced towards him, and held it menacingly above his head. lIe&#xD;
caught her by the arm and threw her to the floor, and after taking the&#xD;
vessel from her, slapped her face several tinies."_&#xD;
'Take that ! and thatb' he said, as blow after blow fell upon her&#xD;
face and neck. 'I'll teach you to threaten me. I'nm going now; atild&#xD;
before I leave, I have a few words of warning to say to you: Thi&#xD;
must be the last time that we ever meet; and if you ever dare to coin e&#xD;
where.I am, I will have your child taken from you and put where you&#xD;
will 'neve ' see him again, and you shall be sent to the insae 'asylum&#xD;
as a lunatic; and I will take good care to keep you there.' And with&#xD;
these brutal words and a fiendish smile, he took his departure."&#xD;
"Poor Leonnie; her sorrow knew no bounds. She snatched up the&#xD;
child and drew it to her breast. 'Oh, God !' she cried, 'do not let my&#xD;
heart break. Oh, have mercy upon me; assuage the anguish which&#xD;
swells my breast. Do not let these overwhelming trials drive me mad.&#xD;
I would l-ive, and in nmy right mind, for my darling's sake.'"&#xD;

"It was near seven o'clock when Lennie arrived at the cottage, which&#xD;
stood down a little lane leading from the Bloomingdale road. She&#xD;
entered, the little gate and stepped upon the porch. Judge of her&#xD;
astonishment to find it closed, and a heavy ar nailed across the door.&#xD;
'he sat dowil upon the steps, for she felt faint and weary. 'What shall&#xD;
I do ?' she* said, in despairing accents.  "Iusbandless, houseless ;&#xD;
and, if I dare to complain, become childless, and the inmate of a mad-&#xD;
house.' IHer head fell upon her bosoni; hope had fled from her&#xD;
heart."&#xD;

cry. Nelsie get yosey for you in 'e mornin'"&#xD;
The lisping prattle of the child probed the wound within herbreast&#xD;
and caused it to bleed afresh, yet it nerved her to make an effort to feed&#xD;
and lodge her child. She passed out of-the gate and soon reached the&#xD;
door of the shanty."&#xD;
"'0, come in, my lady, you are welcome,' exclaimed the hostess."&#xD;
Upon entering Leonnie found herself surrounded by some rough&#xD;

her and said: ' You will give me some bread for little Nelsie ; wOn'It&#xD;

"' Leonnie,' saidl Mrs. Field, ' go to bed, you are discouragedl;' a good&#xD;
night's sleep will make you well again. In the morning you will feel&#xD;
more light-hearted. The winter is past; it is now the month of May&#xD;

you can get a place at service ; and when you have earned alittle money&#xD;

wretchedness stole across her countenance. 'You go to bed, Mrs.&#xD;

"'No, no,' replied  i rs. Field, I will not leave you. You can write&#xD;

Greenwich street, she aasedat the coi'nbr dp aarclayuntil a carriage&#xD;

the carriage turned the corner, the gentleman looked out of the window.&#xD;
It was Philip Wardell. 'or an instant his eyes caught those of Leon-&#xD;

"At the foot of Barclay street the carriage entered the Hoboken&#xD;

gate who called after her:&#xD;
'liere, young woman, I want three centzfor your fare.'&#xD;
" Just then a crowd of passengers came up, an(a he thought no moore&#xD;

"Searcely had the words passed his lips, when Leonnie, becoming&#xD;
desperate, approached the door of the carriage nearest the lady,&#xD;
and touched : the  soft satin sleeve of the dress of Mercellia-for&#xD;
that was the name of Philip's young wife.* She shuddered as her&#xD;
eyes met those of Leonnie."&#xD;
'What is the matter, young woman ?' she asked, in a kind tone of&#xD;
Viee, at the same time offering her a small purse of money." .&#xD;
Leonnie laughed as she threw it back into the carriage, saying&#xD;

his fingers through his dark, curling lock, "and thereby thought to&#xD;

the forehead of his old nurse and benefactress. Then, after bidding&#xD;
ter good-night, he proceeded to the Astor House, and procuring a room&#xD;
he called for pen, ink and paper. When these articles were brought&#xD;
him he 'dismissed the servant, and closing the door, sat down at a table&#xD;
and wrote the following epistle&#xD;
NEw YoRK, SEPT. 20, 18-.&#xD;
 ALTER DEAN EsQ.-De4r Sir: You will doubtless be much sur-&#xD;
prised at the contents of this communication.&#xD;
Circumstances have rendered it impossible for me to return to Phila-&#xD;
delphia at present Events have transpired of which I was entirely&#xD;
ignorant until ay resent visit to this city.&#xD;
During the few days that I have been here, I have learned facts eon-&#xD;
cernin my birth and parentage which, if known, in the eyes of the&#xD;
superci ious world, would brand me as unworthy of your friendship or&#xD;
your daughter's hand. I will leave you to conjecture the truth; but&#xD;
with a sorrowing heart and eyes flowig with tears, I hereby relinquish&#xD;
all claim to both.&#xD;
You know how much I love Carrie, and can guess how many strug-&#xD;
gles it will cost me to leave her ; but I cannot ask he t share my dis-&#xD;
grace. I would not take her from her purity-fro a-11 that is chaste&#xD;
and refined, to have the finger of Ecorn pointed at her. Oh? if she&#xD;
were poor and humble, I would exclaim, in the language of the Moor :&#xD;
"If heaven would make me a world of one entire nd perfect chrysQ.&#xD;
ilte I would not sell her for it."&#xD;
I will enclose a note to her, which after you have read, you may give&#xD;
to her, if it should please you to do so.&#xD;
You will please excuse the briefness of this letter. You may guess&#xD;
my feelings under the painfkil circumstances. If we never meet again,&#xD;
may-God smile upon you and yours, is the wish  our true, grateful&#xD;
and ever faithful friend.                     Etso WARDELL.&#xD;

At the l eeting of the citizens it was decided that ach one should&#xD;
take a toy trumpet' as they thought that with this novel instrument it&#xD;
wtilde impossible to mistake the sinal of the, banditti for that of&#xD;
their own. The trumpets were ofcourse to be used for signaling the&#xD;
party to repair to the spot in case of an encounter.&#xD;

that darl, lonely ravine. At length the firing of the enemy ceased.&#xD;
It w  evident that their powder had given out.&#xD;
"The are retiring 1" cried Nelson to his companies.&#xD;
"Ye ," answered one, "all of- them who are able."&#xD;
e bandits had leaped intotheir saddles and rode off at a rapid, rate&#xD;
I fly pursued by Nelsoi and party. A hundred rods or so from the&#xD;
3cene of the conflict, the horse of our young hero stumbled over the0&#xD;
prostrate body of a man. A deep groan followed, and Nelson, who had&#xD;
reigned up his horse, asked :&#xD;
"Who are you?"&#xD;
"CA dying man," was the faint reply.&#xD;
Nelson dismounted, and holding his horse by the bridle, stooped&#xD;
down and asked:&#xD;
"Have you anything to -say?"&#xD;
'Yes," whispered the sufferer, "I have been the captain of this&#xD;
bad for two years, and have many crimes to answer for in thie net&#xD;
world; but I need not confess them here to you. All I have to say is,&#xD;
that my real name is Philip Wardell, of New York."&#xD;
" Philip Wardell I" exclaimed Nelson; " id you know a lady by&#xD;
the name of Leonnie St. Jamies?'&#xD;
" Oh I do not torture me with her .menory I  She is un angel! I&#xD;
cannot go where she is. Oh, no I my path in the unknown world will&#xD;
be far from that which was taken by., her saint-like spirit. Oh, Le-&#xD;
ounieo Leonnie!1- why should your -dear name be brought here as a&#xD;
weapon to tortuz'e my dying moments ? But," continued the old man&#xD;
who are you?"&#xD;
I," said Nelson, "am her son, Nelson Wardell."&#xD;
At this moment Nelson heard the tramp of horses' feet, and putting&#xD;
the trumpet to his lips blew a blast, long and shrill, The sign.&#xD;
was answered, and soon a light appeared, and the whole party rode up&#xD;
They had succeeded iii capturing two of dits. When they&#xD;

PS&#xD;
the previous night's labor, they alf retired except Nelon.&#xD;
After changing his clothes, which were covered with the blood which&#xD;
bad issued from his father's wounds, he proceeded to the cabin o&#xD;
an old man whose trade was that of carpenter. This tan was atruo&#xD;
and confidential friend of Nelson's, and he knew that he cou  tran-&#xD;
him.' When he had awakened him, he related to him the circuMtau-&#xD;
f the night. "And," he continued, "Mr. Iall, the deeas Oh&#xD;
so much like my father that I coUld not bear the idea of having him&#xD;
covered up like a brute. I wish you to prepare a box and go with me&#xD;
to the spot.&#xD;
In, a half hour the box was ready, and. Nelson, with a pick and spade&#xD;
in company with old man Hall, proceeded to the place where they&#xD;
found the body of Philip Wardell, mangled and',covered with blood.&#xD;
Thy placed it in the box, and Nelson spread his pocket-handkerehien&#xD;
over the face; then IHall proceeded to nail down the cover. Theythen&#xD;
went a short distance from the place and selected a spot on a little&#xD;
knoll, and there dug the grave which received all that remained Of the&#xD;
heartless libertine, Philip Wardell.                of interring&#xD;
While Nelson was performing, the last sad rites-that&#xD;
the body of his unnatural father, in the ravine-the prisoners were&#xD;

had been rapidly gathering in town a the news spread - b y the&#xD;
capture of the two bandits, and they were doomed to death- by that&#xD;
judge who knows no mercy-" Judge Lynch."&#xD;
Amid the wild excitement which prevailed during tie day, the body&#xD;
loft in the ravine had been entirely forgotten, and when afew days after&#xD;
the Sheriff dispatched two Men to search for it, they brought backthe&#xD;

"While the hor-ible scenes related in the last chapter were heing.&#xD;
enacted, you are perhaps anxious to know what -has become of Carrie&#xD;
Dean. You will perhaps wonder if she ever thinks of her boy-lover-&#xD;
her affianced husband, Nelson Wardell, the poor lonely orphan.-&#xD;
0, yes, dear reader, the imageof Nelson Wardell was never absent t&#xD;
from her mind. His name was mingled with her morning and evening&#xD;
devotions.-&#xD;
Poor Carrie was ignorant of the circumstances which had separated&#xD;
her from the one upon whom she had bestowed the -first gushings (of&#xD;
her young'and pure maiden heart.'&#xD;
Her father,.after reading Nelson's letter, concluded that it would be&#xD;
best to leave her in ignorance of the real state of affairs concerning her&#xD;
affianced husband- and to her eager inquiries,'he only answered-&#xD;
My daughter, Nelson has proved himself unworthy of your love.&#xD;
He preferred. to seek his fortune in California to remaining with us.&#xD;
You see that he is undeserving of the affection that you have bestowed&#xD;
upon him; so therefore, my child, think no more of him."&#xD;
"But, dear father," said Carrie, in a broken tone of voice, "did he&#xD;

valued by hermore than all the rare and beautiful plants whieh deco:.&#xD;
rated her garden. She paused and bent over it; one briny drop min-&#xD;
gled with the pure spring water which she used in irrigating. As she&#xD;
stood, herlbreast heaving with emotion, her thoughts wandering hither&#xD;
and thither like the dove from the ark seeking a resting place, the world&#xD;
was completely shut out; it seemed like spirit mingling with spirit.&#xD;
The sweet trance was still upts her-when the Voice of her father called&#xD;
her back to the reality of her lore1y state of being.&#xD;
Oh, cruel parent I first to deceive your daughter in regard to the&#xD;
truth and constancy of the one she loves, and thrn4 deprive, her of the&#xD;
sweet communion of spirit with spirit.&#xD;
"Carrie, child, come in," he said' 'it is far past nightfall. Your&#xD;
dress is too thin to remain in the dewy air, Come with me -Dougla:s&#xD;
is in the parlor waiting to:see you."&#xD;
For a moment Carrie hesitated, 'fhe naame of Douglas was hateful&#xD;
to her. Not that she would willingly hate any one; but she knew&#xD;
that he only sought the goodwill of her childish father and herself, that&#xD;
he might become the possessor of her hand and the-immense fortune to&#xD;
which she was soleolieir.~&#xD;
Seeing that herfather was about to repeat his request, she approached&#xD;
him, kissed his wrinkled cheek and said&#xD;
"Father, I trust that you will admit that I have ever been to you a&#xD;
confiding and obedient child; thatI have sought your counsel and acted&#xD;
according to your advice, and have obeyed all your commands. I love&#xD;
and reverence you next to my God; and, I know you loveme and would&#xD;
not knowingly case me pain unless you thought that I would'profit by&#xD;
it; and never until within the last few weeks have you urged mew to do&#xD;
aught against my will. You could not have failed to note that the im.&#xD;
portunities of Mr. Douglas have been unpleasant. to me. You know I&#xD;
do not love him; and I have told you that I never could. My love is&#xD;
buried within my heart. I can never love again ; 'nd would not give&#xD;
my hand without my heart to one a thousand timeskmore worthy than&#xD;
that fortune-seeker within there. It is not nece ary that I should&#xD;
marry for the purpose of souring a competency, even though speculation&#xD;
,should ruin you. The fortune left mie by grand-fathuer is sufficient to&#xD;
support us in. luxury for the balance of our days, You know that I&#xD;
would'not be helping you by -rmarrying; you wod be the loser; that&#xD;

Placing the manuscript in her portfolio, she looked at her watch-&#xD;
"So late!1" she exclaimed; "near one o'clock."  Then extinguishing&#xD;
the lamp she sought her bud, and in a few moments was sleeping-.&#xD;
The next morning when she awoke, she felt muc -e-reshbed from the&#xD;
few hours of sleep Which sh bad enjoyed. About tei o'lock A. M., of&#xD;
the same day, she had the pleasure of giving welcome to her maiden&#xD;
aunt, Deborah Dean, one of the most pleasant and apparently contented&#xD;
old maids in the world.&#xD;
One morning, about a week after Aunt Deborah's arrival at the house&#xD;
of her brother, and as she was assisting Carrie in preparing dresses for&#xD;
a tour to a neighboring city, the street door bell was rung violently.&#xD;
The next moment a murmuring of voices was.heard, and a servant&#xD;
0-alled out:&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Carrie, do conic down&#xD;
Aunt Deborah and Carrie, alarmed at the unusual noise and confusion,&#xD;
ran down the stair-way, and in the hall,, to their utter astonishment,&#xD;
they beheld Mr. Dean lying upon the oil-eloth, surrounded by a crowi I&#xD;
of curious gazers.&#xD;
"What is the matter?" asked Aunt Deborah.&#xD;
* A gentleman stepped towards her and' said: "Madam, I fear Mr.&#xD;
Dean is dead. ie fell in a fit some fifteen minutes ago, and-has no&#xD;
spoken or given signs of life since. But here comes Dr. Moore, your&#xD;
family physician.&#xD;
At this moment Dr. Moore entered the. front door. Ile ordered the&#xD;
body to be laid upon a sofa in the parlor, and then shutting out the&#xD;
crord lf speetators, proceeded to make an examination. At the expi-&#xD;
ration of a few minutes, during which both Deborah, and Carrie had&#xD;
stood in almost breathless silence, the Doctor said in a low and solemnu&#xD;
whisper: " It is all over ;he is dead."&#xD;
pon receiving this information, poor Carrie gave a faint cry and&#xD;
sank upon the floor in a swoon. In this condition she was borne by the&#xD;
faithful, grief-stricken-servants to her room. After she was placed upon&#xD;
her bed, the Doctor administered a soothing draught. In a few momnenti&#xD;
0he- opened her eyes. Aunt Deborah.was holding her hand and bathing&#xD;
her teiples with Cologne water.&#xD;

to) his car~eandhope, after reading it, he will not fail to lundtIfae note&#xD;
to you. You remember the conversation which took place between us&#xD;
the day before we parted, in regard to my birth and parentage. I have&#xD;
more than realized my worst fears upon that iniportaInt subject.&#xD;
My mother is dead, and thank heaven, though she died of a broken&#xD;
heart, she died pure ! yes, as pure and spotless as the angels. But my&#xD;
father still lives, or was living a few years ago. .lRe is a villian of the&#xD;
deepest and blackest character. Through his heartlessness and descr-&#xD;
tion of my mother, while I was a mer infant, my dear mother com.&#xD;
mitted suicide. Of course these circumtances, connected with my past&#xD;
lifl'e although no fault of mine, will render a union between us impossi-&#xD;
bde. I do not entertain the least shadow of a'hope that your father will&#xD;
give his consent, even should your generous nature prompt you-to over-&#xD;
look my misfortune. But, dear Carrie, whatever may be your feelings,&#xD;
I wish you to wrote a few lines to me. A few kind words from your&#xD;
.lear hand will comfort rme in my weary, lonely wanderings, and let me&#xD;
assure you that whatever my lot may be, or wherever fate may turn my&#xD;
fotsteps, you will be remembered with the warm, unchanging affection&#xD;
which I have cherished for you for the last ten years. -Nothing shall&#xD;
abusee my heart to change towards you, and if we never meet again on&#xD;
rarth, it will be the memory of your sweet, pure love which shall gpide&#xD;
y wounded heart in the pathof duty to my fellow men. Should you&#xD;
1el inclined, and obtain your father' permission to answer this, I will&#xD;
write to you again. But; do nothing without consulting him. If 1do&#xD;
not hear from you-if I am nt permitted the dear pleasure cA^ reading&#xD;
an epistle from your band, I will strive to bear allwith patience, and still&#xD;
emain unchanged k my fellings ,ftr you. Oh  I could talk to you on&#xD;
paper for hours, but will close- with hoping that this may find you well,&#xD;
anid subscribing myself your devoted  -     Nou    WARDELL.&#xD;

Come, rouse thee, dearest: 't is not wVel&#xD;
To let the spirit brood&#xD;
Thus darkly o'er the cares that swelt&#xD;
Life's current to a fload.&#xD;
As brooks and torrents, rivers, all&#xD;
Increase the gulf in which they fall,&#xD;
iSuch thoughts, by gathering up the rills&#xD;
Of lesser griefs, spread real ills;&#xD;
And with their gloomy shades conceal&#xD;
The landmarks 1ope would else reveal."&#xD;
The funeral was over.    A week had passed, during -which Aunt&#xD;
Deborah and the kind-hearted doctor had used every exertion to divert.&#xD;
ihe mind of the lonely orphan from her solitary condition. But it was&#xD;
a hard task for Carrie to assume a pleasant air. Ifers was a double-&#xD;
sorrow. Now that she couI no longer enjoy the society of her ever&#xD;
kind and affectionate father, she felt more than ever the want of thro&#xD;
ear one who had been the companion of all her maiden pleasures and&#xD;
)1roWS.&#xD;
"Oh! if Nelson had not left," she would murmur, ''his presence&#xD;
would assuage much of the anguish which I now feel."&#xD;
She had confided her secret love and all the circumstances connected&#xD;
with it to Aunt Deborah, who sympathized with her, and in return&#xD;

r1 feeling unequal to this painful ask requested her aunt to  erftorin&#xD;
the duty for her.&#xD;
"With pleasure, dear Carrie,' said the kind-hearted Deborah.&#xD;
As she was engaged in this duty, her eye fell upon a note directed to&#xD;
"Carrie Dean, care of Walter B. Dean," and called out&#xD;
"fHere, Carrie, is somethir belogi.g to you, dear.&#xD;
Carrie reached forth her hand and received the note. The superserip-&#xD;
tion was in the well-remembered hand-writing of Nelson. "What can&#xD;
this mean?" she asked in a trembling voice; "I never received a note&#xD;
from  him. There is somtie mystery and perhaps mistake connected with&#xD;
tIhis. I cannot gather col-rage to read'itmyself, will you do so for me,&#xD;

-adinthe leter, -he was often interrupted&#xD;
by sobs and eca te     t o thelipsof Carrie, such as "Poor. Nel-&#xD;
sonI poor Nlison!"&#xD;
Aunt Deborah, too often paused to clear her throat of a choking sen -&#xD;
sation which  oud rse in spite of her effors ochk it.    She&#xD;
hadfinished, she arose, and taking Carrie's hand within her own, said:&#xD;
Dear girl, dry yur tears; there is peace and joy, perhaps' in store&#xD;
for you. I feel tht he hand of Providence is working for your good&#xD;
Come, come, cheer up"&#xD;
But still Carr  ept. '1h0!" she exlaimed amid her  terwhr&#xD;
could have been my father's object in withholding this letter 'rom&#xD;
mI~3 "&#xD;
Pride; nothing but pride;" sighed Aunt Deborah. "Oh! how&#xD;
Many true hearts have been severed by that curse.! But for pride&#xD;
might ha.ve been a happy wife. But Come, Carrie, you are your owt&#xD;
mistress now;-mistress of an immense. fortune,-mistress of ti"s&#xD;
secret, and' mistress of both these little white hands ; and now, yufl&#xD;
have onlyto beome a woman'; anid-bya lMOP, maneuvering you Mniy&#xD;

him flgse," said Aunt feborah, with a theatrical air,&#xD;
Whistle hini off, and sen&amp;amp;hiun&#xD;
Down the wind, a prey to fortune."&#xD;
Carrie could not help smiling at her aunt's attempt to rouse her; 2and&#xD;
that smile told more than one tale. It told of a bright, golden glam&#xD;
of hope which was entwining. itself around her heart, and playing,&#xD;
bo-peep with the little flutterer.&#xD;
I will pass over one month. A busy month it had been with Carric&#xD;
and Aunt Deborah. In that period, all the property belonging to the&#xD;
estate of the late Mr. Dean had been sold, Carrie had purchased  W&#xD;
elegant mansion, and had it fitted up according to her own taste. All&#xD;
of the old servants of her father's household had been retained by the!r&#xD;
oufg mistress.&#xD;
"Ad n w, said Carrie, one pleasant morning- just after the break-&#xD;
fast was over, ",dear Aunt, that all is settled, I want you to eveal to-&#xD;
me your plan of action in this wonderful plot of yours, which you say,&#xD;
should it prove successful, will render the remainder of my days, days&#xD;
of happiness and peace."&#xD;
"Very well, said Aunt Deborah. with a pleasant smile, "I wil&#xD;
explain, and if my fair niece-approves, which I think she will, like a&#xD;
,ood sensible girl as she is, we will lose no time in putting it into prc.'&#xD;

blessed with much of this world's goods. She is very fond of Carrie,&#xD;
and is anxious, as far as her means will permit, to support her unfortu-&#xD;
xate niece in the enjoyment of every little lnxury. The  or child is.&#xD;
engaged in painting landscapes, which I believe will afford her a very&#xD;
nice little income. But she is too fragile and delicate to perform much&#xD;
labor.&#xD;
I know, dear Nelson, that she loves you still, for I have observed her&#xD;
weeping while gazing'upon your likeness. She does not know that I&#xD;
have written anything about her to you ; but if you still love her, I&#xD;
wish you would write a few lines to her; for I do love her so much,.&#xD;
There was some mistake about the note you told me yon sent her at the&#xD;
time you wrote to her father; at least I think so, for she told me the&#xD;
other day that she'had never read a line from you since you left-; and&#xD;
shethought very strange that yp  efj .wihotone word o her  So, if&#xD;
youlie, I i k  o aJcd  better write  a few  lines, to)  her.."  I  amd  very&#xD;
well; and since Carrie, has been with me, I feel perfectly hapy  I&#xD;
feel, dear Nelson, that God is indeed blessing me in my old days.&#xD;
Write as oft eiaposeible, and believe me&#xD;

It was within cdty thAt Nelsn read the foregoing letter; and the&#xD;
eep gush of reret rand sorrow:which followed, caused the fever to rise,&#xD;
and his nurse, 'anold o6lored man, was obliged to send for the doctor.&#xD;
Some unusual ecictement has' brought on'this"fever;" said the&#xD;
,doctor, some   pterlly.'&#xD;
I think  replied the nurse, "that it was caused by his reading a&#xD;
letter fr   the States." 1 tried to keep him from reading it; but he&#xD;
insisted upon doing so, and I could not prevent him.."&#xD;
During the night Nelson rayed so that it was necessary to call in&#xD;
several gentlemen to assist in keeping him in bed., He sai~l that Oarrie&#xD;
"Was star,viig nd tIhat 'ho must go to her.&#xD;
4bout four o'eJpek in the 'morning, he fell into a quiet sleep, which&#xD;
continued until about seven. He then opened his eyes, and asked in a&#xD;
feeble yoice for the doctor. ~T'e'doctor, who was lying upon a sofa in&#xD;
the'same room, arose and went tthe hedgide. and kindly asked what&#xD;
he wanted.&#xD;
" Doctor" said Nelson, "'do you think that I cam$ live?"&#xD;
"Yes;"4 replied the doctor; "if you will obey my orders, I think&#xD;
that there is ,o doubt but what you will recover. -You must keep per.&#xD;
~cetly quiet, pnd take the medicine just as I order it." '&#xD;
Two Weeks previous to the reception of Mrs. Field's letter, Nelson&#xD;
iad beenge4 t ewn with typhoid fever, and it was just at the crisis&#xD;
that he had received and read the epistle; and although the doctor had&#xD;
butlittle hope of his recovery, he thought it'best t give his patient the&#xD;
beneft -f adgiux  hope; an4 from that moment, a strong will took&#xD;
possession of. the invalid to overcome the disease and live for poor Car..&#xD;

&#xD;
Here, poor Carrie burst into tears. This thoughtwas too such fo&#xD;
her nerves. She arose fron1the table, and throwing herself upon  er&#xD;
couch, sobbed long and bitterly; until ,vercoine by the .tensity of b&#xD;
feelings, a lethargy stole over her, and there she lay in a state of rb&#xD;
dreaminess, forgetful of all surrounding objects. Vhere was  ap upon&#xD;
her door, but she heard it not. Then a figure stole softly'ip and stood&#xD;
&#xD;

rie's sake; and it was with surprise that the doctor witnessed the rapid&#xD;
recovery of the sick man.&#xD;
asedfot the East, he&#xD;
A few days before the day on which the ma i  for hetEot he&#xD;
was able to dictate a letter to Mrs. Field in which he to&#xD;
long illness and rapid recovery; and added tha if New Yoti-  t&#xD;
get better, he should start by the next steamV              h fordNew ork&#xD;
also asked her to keep his intentions a secret from Uarrie, as he wiehe&#xD;
to surprise her.&#xD;
It happened, very fortunately, that at  e t&#xD;
Car-rie had gone out to ride. So Mrs Field said' nothlug ibout the&#xD;
receipt of it; but vith a happiness which she could  y    ea&#xD;
set about making preparations for the :reeeptio fherAdopted&#xD;
Carrie, ' the mneani time often wondered if Mrs-'ield te4 heard from&#xD;
Nelson, but did not venture to make the inquiry t&#xD;
Nearly three months had passed since Caie hrd            notthe humble&#xD;
yet comfortable home of her kind friend,ad  tll Dheboar  duereivedno&#xD;
encouragement to hope that the plot k-id -by Aunt Debora w4Voud, su*e.&#xD;
ceed. She became more pale and delicate every ade; bopeomhiy.&#xD;
ing in her heart, and was taking away theLyouth and bloom which&#xD;
0h4uld have blossomed upon her maiden cheek.&#xD;
e               'out sx wks fter Mrs. Field had received th letter from&#xD;
on   Carrie felt more than usually'depressed in spirits. She had&#xD;
sent the carriage back to the stable without taking her accustomed ride)&#xD;
and to Mrs. Field's eaer inquiry of the cause, she answered ,&#xD;
"I wish to write to my aunt."&#xD;
She then went to her room, and began writing sometmhv lik the&#xD;

great een4. -Of course no pains or .expense were spared on the occa-&#xD;
sion. At the proper time invitations were sent out, and-of course all&#xD;
were s rprised at the sudden, Announcement of a wedding.&#xD;
One Week before theevening on which the wedding was to take phice,&#xD;
Carrie bid good-by to Nelson and Mrs. Field, and returned to her man-&#xD;
sion inPhiladelphia, where she was to remain'until the wedding came&#xD;
"Oh, my sweet love!" said Nelson ;' how shallI live a whole week&#xD;
without you ? Now- that we have been reunited, I feel that life would&#xD;
he a blgnk without your dear presence."&#xD;
During the three weeks'awhich they had remained' together, Nelson&#xD;
had, related to Carrie the history of his unfortunate mother, and also&#xD;
of the terrible death of his father.&#xD;
When Nelson showed Carrie the picture of Leonnie, she was almost&#xD;
struck duMb with admiration.&#xD;
"What a sweet face!' she exclaimed; and vhen they parted, she&#xD;
requested Nelson to let her take the picture with her, to which he con-&#xD;
sented.&#xD;
The week passed. The day--the eventfuly came,. apd Nelson in&#xD;
company with Mrs. Field started for Philadelphiia.At n clock they&#xD;
arrived and fonnd a carriage with Aunt Deborah at the dep(t, waiting&#xD;
to take them to the residence of the bride.&#xD;
Oh, what a-'beautiful place " exclaimed Mrs. Field, as Aunt Ijebo&#xD;
r-l pointed out the park and elegant house, where the wedding was&#xD;
to take place.&#xD;
" Yes," replied Aunt Deboramh, "I think it a very delightful phlee.&#xD;
and I trust that Nelson and Carrie will enjoy a pleasant honey-moon&#xD;
there. It will be much more pleasant than traveling this warm awl&#xD;
dusty weather."&#xD;
Nelson was silent. Ile was too muich engrossed with the happy&#xD;
thought of meeting Carrie to even hear what was passing.- -The reader&#xD;
can imagine his thoughts more easily than I can express them in words.&#xD;
.After long years of snifering, during which time a dark cloud had ol-&#xD;
scried the horizon of his'future hopes, and it seemed that he was thrown&#xD;

in one hand and happiness in the other, while gentle Prudence held&#xD;
forth a banner emblematic of her presence, upon-which was written in&#xD;
golden letters- PLET,"    A whole train of beautiful spirits was&#xD;
riing up before his enraptured gaze when his mind was suddenly&#xD;
brought back to the reality of earthly things by the sweet voice of Car-&#xD;
rie calling to a servant to run:tnd open the park gate. The next mo-&#xD;
ment he caught sight (?f her sweet, smiling face, and received a wave of&#xD;
welcome by a nowy' handkerchief,&#xD;
The wedding was'over, a week had passed, and yet no arrangements&#xD;
had been 'made for the future residence of Nelson and his bride, LIe&#xD;
had placed in a bank upon his arrival in Ner York the sum of fifteen&#xD;
thousand dollars, and thought several times of consulting Carrie in&#xD;
'regard to business affairs. Of course he thought Carrie had rather&#xD;
remain in Philadelphia; and if so, he would make arrangements to go&#xD;
into business in that city. Ile sat thinking this matter over one morn-&#xD;
ing, while Carrie and Aunt Deborah were holding a private cerfer6nce&#xD;
in an adjoining-room. Ile had observed considerable confusion, ard&#xD;
'had heard some whispering ; but thinking that it would be in-&#xD;
polite to interfere with thearrangements of the -ladies, he remained&#xD;
quiet. In a few moments Aunt D~eborah came to the door, and with&#xD;
som'ethingof mystery in her tone, said:&#xD;
WNelson, please to just step into the next room."&#xD;
ie arose and followed her. Carrie met him at the door,' and taking&#xD;
him by the hand, pointed to alife-sized portrait enclosed in a splendid&#xD;
frame, banging upon the wall.&#xD;
" My mother's. pictne! " exclaimed Nelson, in tones of mingled&#xD;
surprise and pleasure.&#xD;
" Yei," said Carrie, "I took the miniature to Mr. ,' the best&#xD;
artist in the United States ; and. do you not think it 'a splendid and&#xD;
perfect production."&#xD;
" I do, Indeed," said 'Nelson, wiping a tear from his cheek. "Oh,&#xD;
arrie, you are an angel! But, dearest, it m t have cost quite an&#xD;
amount of 'money. Permit me   to send him A check upon my banker."&#xD;
" 0, no," cried Carrie, "the bill is settled. And now, dear Nelson,&#xD;
ihat I feel convinced that you love me for myself alone-that you loved&#xD;
me" as the poor, penniless orpha , 'I trust that you will not love the&#xD;
wealthy heiress less."&#xD;
"' What do you mean, dearest ? come, explain;:" said Nelson, hold-&#xD;
.    4g er to his heart. "Come, come, tell nc what you mean."&#xD;
"Oh' nothing ; only, that I have practiced Alittle deception upon&#xD;

' witch of an old aunt,' I am heirees to seventy thousand dollars; and,&#xD;
that thismnension and grounds, which you so much admire,.is to be our&#xD;
future home; that is, if you wish it, to be so. I amyour wife, and&#xD;
all that I possess is yours, my own de r husband."&#xD;
Mrs. Field could not be prevailed upon to shares with her "dear&#xD;
children," as she termed them, their elegant honie.:So, with  kind,&#xD;
faithful female domestic, she returned to her ownquiet home in New&#xD;
York.&#xD;
'Aunt Deborah remained with her niece, the same, good-natured, and&#xD;
apparently happy-hearted creature we found her.' And the lhst time&#xD;
the writer caught sight of her, she held a tiny babe iR her arms wrapt&#xD;
up in any quantity of flannel, while she glided lightly and noiselessly&#xD;
about the chamber, where lay the pale-faced mother, who had fallen&#xD;
into a gentle slumber.&#xD;
4 letter fell from the hand of old Mrs. Field; and taking her 'specs'&#xD;
from her nose to wipe away the tears which had gathered in her dim&#xD;
eyes, she said, in a broken voice:&#xD;
"Got a babe; a little girl. Oh, my God!' spare it to make glad their&#xD;
hearts'; and may they be spared to train and guide it in the ight path.&#xD;
May no rude blast chill'its tender maidenhood. Yes," she cognued,&#xD;
" and they have called 't Leonnie."&#xD;
At this exclamation t ie old woman burst into tears; and falling upon&#xD;
her knees, she breathed forth the following prayer:&#xD;
"Oh, Heavenly Father ! keep this sweet blossom of true love and&#xD;
affection from the wily snares of tlie base betrayer. May the history a&#xD;
of her grand-mother's wrongs and sufferings prove a warning to Ler,&#xD;
and may she have strength, should the hour of trial come, to resist&#xD;
temptation.&#xD;
Not long after this event, the old lady passed away, in a full hope of&#xD;
salvation, through er Redeemer ; and in a quiet spot near theresidence&#xD;
of Nelson, she rests in peace.&#xD;
And nowin taking leave of this happy fainilyNelson and Carrie,&#xD;
with their little pledge of devoted love, and good"Aunt Deborah, who&#xD;
was instrumental in bringing about all this peace and felicity, that for&#xD;
the meekness and patience with which they bore thcii- several afflictions,&#xD;
which Providence, in its all-wise arrangements saw fit to visit upon&#xD;
them,.that they have well earned the happiness, which like a rosy&#xD;
crown encircles them, a al may thejflive long to cnjoy it in undisturbed&#xD;
peace.&#xD;

[Ier carriage was often stopped, that she might descend to relieve the&#xD;
unfortgnate cripple ; and the mendicant was never turned froim her&#xD;
loor, without having cause to bless the little white band and pleasant&#xD;

world through the press, in flaming characters, for the purpose of mak-&#xD;

largely and publicly to orphan asylhms atid charitable instituti ns, she             *&#xD;

Several poor families whom I have myself fisited,4Iave spoken of the&#xD;

And now, dear reader,.a word to you. Do not let misfortune crush&#xD;
you; for when the hand of sorrow presses hardest upon you, then your&#xD;
hitherto pretended friends will floe from you. 'T is then that you will&#xD;
need all your strength of body and energy of mind to stand up under&#xD;
the accumulated load of grief. - But if you keop ,a firm heart, with -&#xD;
consciousness-of doing right, all the combined powers of your endmies&#xD;
will fail to triumph over you. The darkness and gloom will pas saway,&#xD;
and you will be able to cry aloud, in a triumphant voice-Grief aind&#xD;
sorrow, 1e gone! and the smiling angel of Peace will weave a circle of,&#xD;
happiness whichwill cheer you on when the final hour arrives in which&#xD;
y   1, shall lay side the mortal fo the immortal,&#xD;

from their beauty and fragrance. We find her making them her com-r&#xD;
panions even after Reason had deserted'her throne. If she had faults,&#xD;
they must have sprung from lack of careful training during-the tender&#xD;
years of childhood; or, perhaps, disappointed hopes in girlhood. The&#xD;
richest soil often produces the most p6isonous and cankerous weeds, if&#xD;
not properly cultivated. Some early blight or bitter disappointment&#xD;
may have turned the current of the placid stream into rough and angry&#xD;
waters. At a tenderagealone and friendless, she launched her frail&#xD;
bark upon the broad ocean of public opinion; and without counting&#xD;
upon adverse winds, she thought to stebr clear of shoals and quick-&#xD;
sands. There were many ways before her, and if, through lack of ex-&#xD;
perience, she chose the wrong one, there perhaps was no kind voice to&#xD;
call her back; but thousands of brainless, heartless ones to cheer her&#xD;
on to ruin, for the mere satisfaction of witnessing the wreck which they&#xD;
had helped to, make.  or the last fewyears of her life, as if weary of&#xD;
the mistaken course she had pursued, she turned- her mind upon more&#xD;
useful matters, and became an humble follower in that faith which, let&#xD;
us hope, has fitted her for the companionship of the blessed in the realms&#xD;
of that unon9wn shoreto which the great and pioud, as well as the&#xD;
poor and humblejmust sooner or later be summoned,' to answer for the&#xD;
deedscommitted here. I trust her own sex, at least, -,ill never permit&#xD;
a harsh remark to pass their lips inregard to her past life. Dear lady&#xD;
readers, speak only of her good qualities; for had she, like many of&#xD;
you, been surrounded by kindly influencs-her young mind trained&#xD;
to moral worth-her ambition checked by the gentle and loving voice&#xD;
of a mother,; had brothers And sisters, and kind friends gathered&#xD;
around the fireside of her early home and watched her into woman-&#xD;
hood, with her lofty and towering talent, she might have been, the&#xD;
1rihtest ornambent of the present age.&#xD;
