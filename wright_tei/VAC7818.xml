trees, and when the rubies and diamonds drop upon the smooth&#xD;
crust, I hear the fairies laughing at me, and ringing their little&#xD;
silver bells. Hark, mamma ! they are at it now. Listen how&#xD;
they tinkle, tinkle ! Ah ! my mamma, you are so charming&#xD;
when you sport with me,-- when you bend your head and&#xD;
hearken to hear something, it is as if an angel were whispering&#xD;
secrets to you.. The Lady Delight was not half so pretty as you,&#xD;
when she put on the white satin robe she got out of her silken&#xD;
purse, and Prince Alznanzor called her ' peerless water-lily.'&#xD;
Oh, yes, mamma! I know why you are so sweet. It is be.&#xD;
cause you love me with your nice eyes. You look, mother, at&#xD;
me. It is good to be your child. I wish Gracie was it too,&#xD;
mamma. .Why didn't you have Gracie and me babies together?&#xD;
There was plenty of room in my cradle."&#xD;
A boyish voice, rough and hearty, and a stamping of heavily-&#xD;
shod feet outside the door, changed Pauline, in the twinkling&#xD;
of an-eye, from the dreamy, smiling child lying on her mother's&#xD;
lap, playing with her golden hair, into an active, wide-awake&#xD;
young animal,"all frisk and motion.&#xD;
" That's Dick ! He and Gracie and -I are going coasting.&#xD;
Ah, my muffler, where has it got to ?f" She sprang briskly&#xD;
about,, tossing on her hat, battling with her wraps. '" Dick's&#xD;
got him a new pig-sticker, and we are going to make a double-&#xD;
ripper out of it and my PegassusI; but I shall have him by&#xD;
himself some, because Gracie likes him best. She's afraid of&#xD;
double-rippers. You never saw such a scary girl as Gracie is.&#xD;
She'll get white if.a cow looks at her, and she can't bear the&#xD;
dark. Now .my mittens, mamma. Thanks ! Dick calls my&#xD;
sled Peggy-;,and hes sticks to it that he isn't spelt with two s's ;&#xD;
but I know better than he, because Peter had' it painted onto&#xD;
him so, and I guess my big 'brother is a good spelled. Who'&#xD;
was egassus, gmamma?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"A. winged horse, darling. There is a pretty tale about&#xD;
him in the Wonder Book. When you are weary with your&#xD;
frolic, you may come back to me, and we will read it to-&#xD;
gether."&#xD;
"IOh, yes, mamma ! nice, pretty mamma ! but - I suppose&#xD;
those Pegassuses don't grow, except in fairy books. Chris had&#xD;
one in her Lady Delight story. My donkeys do me pretty&#xD;
good. Daisy will trot with me and Gracie both.-' Dick tried&#xD;
to stick on too, but he kept. sliding off at the tail. I wish&#xD;
Daisy had been fixed a little bit -longer, mamma, so that we&#xD;
could all three ride him. You see, Dandy hee-haws so dread-&#xD;
fully, and groans and sticks out his fore-feet, and stands ;there&#xD;
stock-still, just whenever he feels like, it; not an inch will he&#xD;
budge unless he has got a mind to. Last summer, he stopped&#xD;
right in the middle of the road, and he stayed, there so long&#xD;
that Gracie went to sleep ; and a man came, along in a wagon&#xD;
and told us to get: out of the way. And I told him.'how could&#xD;
I get out if Dandy wouldn't go. And he drove past and left&#xD;
us in the rain, and he laughed at us -"&#xD;
"Are you coming, with that Peggy of yours, Pauline?" asked&#xD;
Dick, sticking his rougish face into a crack of the door.&#xD;
"4There, mamma;! didn't I tell you so ! " exclaimed Pauline,&#xD;
in an exasperated voice. "Now tell him that he shan't callhim&#xD;
 .Peggy, and that there were winged horses."&#xD;
" Pho ! I shan't believe that story, Aunt Alice, because, you&#xD;
see,;it couldn't be,; there, isn't any place for 'em to grow, and&#xD;
they couldn't manage two wings and four legs. They wouldn't&#xD;
know whether to run or fly."&#xD;
"Yet, unbelieving Dickon, there was a winged horse in my-.&#xD;
thology, who did wondrous feats.&#xD;
"Wondrous feets I Now, Aunt Alice," said Dick, shaking&#xD;
his head, " where is Mythology? There isn't any segch, pe&#xD;

been clear through Peter Parley and Morse's.'?&#xD;
"You come home with Pauline to dinner, and I'll tell you&#xD;
all about it, dear," said the mother, with her gentle voice, full&#xD;
of smiles.-&#xD;
Yes, Dick ; and we'll bring Gracie too," added Pauline, who&#xD;
rarely left her favorite out of her pleasures. "And you'll cook&#xD;
us some pop-corn balls, wont you, mamma?"&#xD;
"And nut-stick and taffas," answered Mrs. Bradshaw, mak-&#xD;
ing funny round eyes. She was pleased to please her baby-&#xD;
daughter, who, with all her elfin mischief, was so true in her&#xD;
friendships and ardent in her loves. And after the children&#xD;
were gone, she drew her gray shawl lose about her frail figure ;&#xD;
and while her fingers were busy with her embroidery (she was&#xD;
working a set of tidies for Zoe), she fell to wondering whether&#xD;
Pauline and Dick would always be- such fast friends ; and,&#xD;
womanlike, had a vision-of a home with Pauline for mistress&#xD;
and Dick Walsinghanfor master. It was quite natural that&#xD;
her mind should be busy among weddings, with one so close&#xD;
at hand in. her own family, and she. said, with a sigh, to her&#xD;
husband; coming briskly in from his market drive,&#xD;
Peter, I hope I shall live to see Pauline a young lady --&#xD;
and married."&#xD;
"Our Pauline married ! Why, Dainty Pet, how old is the&#xD;
litt e maid?"&#xD;
It does seem a long while in the future, I know ; and that's&#xD;
why-I was thinking maybe I mightn't live to see it."&#xD;
Mr. Bradshaw came and patted the drooping head, every one&#xD;
of whose golden curls were priceless treasures to him, with a&#xD;
tender touch.&#xD;
"My dear Alice, you know that song that Sabrina sings,&#xD;
'We'll sleep together at the foot.'  He stood before the fire&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WINGED HQRSE,&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
looking down at his wife, with his hands beneath his parted&#xD;
coat-tails. And he felt minded to essay the melody, and began,&#xD;
"W-e-ll-ll s-l-e-e-p to-g-e-t-h-e-rr-r," but convincing himself that&#xD;
he had not secured the tune so thoroughly as to give it voice,&#xD;
he left off rumbling among his bass gutturals ; and, wetting his&#xD;
lips, he drew in a deep breath and took to whistling. And he&#xD;
succeeded so thoroughly to his satisfaction, that he went through&#xD;
the whole air, including Sabrina's ornamental interlude, topped&#xD;
off with a mellow trill of his own.&#xD;
"There, Dainty Pet ! that's the way we'll do it; but we'll&#xD;
live to see our great-grandchildren first, please God."&#xD;
She looked at him and smiled. There had been a secret be-&#xD;
tween them once; but after they went together to seeppoor&#xD;
Fred Goldsmith in hiscoffin, she mustered up her strength and&#xD;
opened her heart, and he loved her none the less. Only truth&#xD;
and sweet wifely devotion possessed her soul after that; and&#xD;
so light had he made life's burdens for her, so richly.surrounded&#xD;
her with tenderness, that her early beauty was still untouched&#xD;
by wrinkles, and not a' silver thread had got -leave to- mingle.&#xD;
with her golden hair.&#xD;
"I'd just as soon my girls shouldn't get married, Alice. Il&#xD;
give them money enough ; they shall be independent; not need&#xD;
to run after the men, nor make eyes at them, nor fish for hus-&#xD;
bands anyhow. Let- me see ! Sabrina is sixteen; well, when&#xD;
she's eighteen, I'll settle a nice income upon her, and she may&#xD;
follow out.her tastes. She's-a good sr  t girl; she likes farming;&#xD;
she'd run a place now better than half the men.. If the women&#xD;
ever vote, she'd drive to the polls in her pony-phaeton, and use&#xD;
her elective franchise for the best candidate ; anc:Mhe'dlook&#xD;
so modest, and so womanly strong and secure, thatthi  roughs&#xD;
would take off their hats and, keep in their oaths till she was&#xD;
out of sight. Yes, Sabrina's got excellent sense."&#xD;

HOW ZOE SNUBBED PETER.&#xD;
&#xD;
tBut  I'd rather they'dget good husbands, Peter. It's the&#xD;
truest life and the happiest."&#xD;
"Thank you, Alice. My life has not been a failure, if you&#xD;
can tell me that after a twenty.two years trial of me.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.-&#xD;
HOW ZOE SNUBBED PETER.&#xD;
E feel minded to pay a visit to the Walsinghams.&#xD;
Rather soon, though, after Zoe's return from Rosen-&#xD;
blooim; for this is Christmas day, and she is hardly&#xD;
settled and rested from her tiresome journey.  But I think&#xD;
she looks as fill of merry mischief as ever, and as bright and&#xD;
piquant. Let us see, though, does she.&#xD;
She is sittig i Sabrina Bradshaw's lap, with one arm around&#xD;
her neck, and their -heads so close together that the purple-&#xD;
black tresses mingle -with the heavy masses of sun-touched&#xD;
redWhich Sam Slaughton called "auburn;" and he meant it,&#xD;
and wjs ready to prove the truth of his assertion upon the body&#xD;
of any doubter.&#xD;
Mrs. Walsingham has lain down to rest, after the fatigues of&#xD;
the Christmas-dinner.  The Bradshaws, inclusive, had been&#xD;
there; and little Dick and'Gracie; and Aunt Elinor was over&#xD;
from Merry Bank; and there had been ox-tail soup, pickerel&#xD;
out of the lake, prairie chickens, venison, and Plum-pudding;&#xD;
besides the numberless American pies, which are so good and&#xD;
so indispensable on our sumptuous tables; And there had also&#xD;
been a good deal of talk between the Peters and Aunt'Elinor,&#xD;
about Egyptian wheat; and Aunt Elindr produced her Genesee&#xD;
Farmer, and Peter brought out his RuralAew Yorkerand'they&#xD;
&#xD;
1A4&#xD;
&#xD;
couldn't agree; and Peter the younger promulged new facts on&#xD;
the raising of calves with hay-tea, instead of milk, and pro-&#xD;
duced a leathern contrivance; with a rubber ball attached, which&#xD;
included the pleasure of "bunting" in the imbibing process,&#xD;
making it as natural as possible, - a perfect Alma Mater, in fact.&#xD;
Mrs. Walgingham was never very robust ; and widowed so&#xD;
early, that her married life was but a taste - a sip of happiness.&#xD;
Dr. Jenkins tries every year to coax her off to Cuba or Paler-&#xD;
mo, or some other land of soft breezes, for our rough winter&#xD;
weather tries her sorely ; but she draws her crimson wrap&#xD;
closer, and shakes her head. She had one experience of ex-&#xD;
patriation when Zoe was a wee girleen, and she neyer coiu4&#xD;
get up courage after, to leave the dear home to which she came&#xD;
a timid bride, and where her woman-power carried her bravely&#xD;
through the test-time when the strength of the strong man&#xD;
failed, and his closing eyes grew dim. His head was on her&#xD;
gentle breast, and his hands clasped hers, when the. Death.&#xD;
Angel knocked at the door of his heart. She s-oftly pressed the&#xD;
pale lids upon the soul-mirrors, and shut out the light which&#xD;
had used to gladden her ; and she pondered his good words in&#xD;
the lonely night-watches. She was not a spiritualist ; but she&#xD;
felt her husband's presence around her'; the house was full of&#xD;
memories of him; she is very happy too,  a sunny-tternipered,&#xD;
innocent cheerful little creature, all the tendrils of whose heart&#xD;
are turned about and about her young gypsy of'a .daughter:&#xD;
she is gay in her gayety ; she rejoices in her joy.&#xD;
Miss Elinor has had her bays harnessed and :drivel, up to&#xD;
Craigenfels. Peter  Sre and his Alice have takenthe children&#xD;
home with them, and the two/girls we love ,have_- the drawing-&#xD;
room all to themselves, "curtained, closed, and warm." Just&#xD;
the time and place for confidences : so they-seened to think;&#xD;
or at least Zoe did. Sabrina rarely made canfdences  she&#xD;

thought her thoughts, and lived her independent life; giving&#xD;
much, receiving little.&#xD;
"Did you know that Peter went down to Ball and'Black's&#xD;
before he came up to Rosenbloom?"&#xD;
"No, indeed ; why didn't he go by way of Bombay for a&#xD;
short-cut ; what took.him meandering off there, pray?"&#xD;
"Well, that .-I suppose." Zoe turned away her head with&#xD;
petulant grace, and thrust out her little hand. "At any rate,&#xD;
he brought it away with him; how'do you like it? I think it&#xD;
is just lovely."&#xD;
"Beautiful, Zoe, dear, beautiful! I always did like opals; but&#xD;
opals and diamonds ! absolutely my admiration;- and they suit&#xD;
you, for you do opalesce with every passing moment. You&#xD;
are red, fiery -green, jealous -yellow, suspicious -- orange,&#xD;
whimsical -violet, associative -= and true blue, through all."&#xD;
"Thank your wisdom. Why not go on with your analysis,&#xD;
and resolve "me into my elements?"&#xD;
" «Ah, Zoe darling , no haste for that";'he who sits the pale&#xD;
horse will accomplish his dread mission all too soon.&#xD;
"'So shalt thou in earth,&#xD;
Dwell full cold,&#xD;
Dimly and dark."'&#xD;
Zoe fidgeted impatiently, as well she might, and withdrew her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"You make me shiver and spoil all the pleasure of my ring.&#xD;
How can you conjure up such a ghastly image to be coupled&#xD;
with it?  I'll tell Peter ! Positively, you're like the skeleton&#xD;
at the feast."&#xD;
"Nay, nay, my pretty Zoe ! Precious soul, never show thy&#xD;
red opalescence, glowing hot and fiery, but bring forth that&#xD;
ry hidden hand " and let me see the treasure."  :&#xD;
Zoe answered Sabrina's kiss with a smile through her crim-&#xD;

son pout, and produced, from beneath her apron, a morocco&#xD;
case. She snapped it open, and showed a set of pink coral,&#xD;
cut in roses and buds, lying displayed upon their black velvet,&#xD;
- necklace, ear-rings, brooch, bracelets, and all.&#xD;
"Ah! how many thousand years of toil and death it has&#xD;
taken to perfect those deep-sea beauties !" exclaimed Sabrina.&#xD;
" Sabrina Bradshaw ! what possesses you !" retorted Zoe,&#xD;
shaking her friend's handsome shoulders. "You are worse&#xD;
than Chris Goldsmith. Come! drop your heroic doldrums and&#xD;
your tiresome learning, and be sensible. I begin to think you&#xD;
don't like my presents."&#xD;
Sabrina laughed,&#xD;
"'The primrose on the river's brim.&#xD;
A yellow primrose was to him;&#xD;
And nothing more.'&#xD;
Don't be vexed, Zoe : the fact is, I've been reading "Cos-&#xD;
mos," and I am still rather muddled with it. The everlasting&#xD;
hills feel shaky, and the cooled crust, an uncertain tenure.&#xD;
I do enjoy your presents and your presence," -squeezing her ;&#xD;
"and, of a truth, I'd no idea our Peter was so skilled in jewels.&#xD;
Let us try' them on at once."&#xD;
'Oh, dear, no ! " Zoe shook positively her little head. " Not&#xD;
with this dress ; high-neck," - touching her smooth throat with&#xD;
her pointed brown finger. " I wanted horribly to wear them&#xD;
at the Rosenbloom party; but you know that was impossible.&#xD;
Rose corals with garnet crepe ! Barbarous ! But come -up to&#xD;
my room, and I'll just slip on an evening dress; I couldnever&#xD;
bear to spoil the, first effect : nothing but black lace or white&#xD;
muslin with these. Tulle over creamy silk might do ; did you&#xD;
ever see any thing lovelier than this coronet?"&#xD;
" Never ! superb enough for a countess ; though I don't know&#xD;
why a countess should have any thing more superb than you or I."&#xD;

Sabrina drew herself up ; and if she had glanced across at the&#xD;
mirror, she might have seen a queenly figure there. " Come,"&#xD;
she added, rising hastily, as if the affair was of the last impor-&#xD;
tance, and not a moment to be lost, "let us go at once."&#xD;
"uStay just one instant first, Sabrina."  Zoe stood up, and&#xD;
laid her hand on her friend's arm. "Do you know what that&#xD;
ridiculous Peter wants me to do ?"&#xD;
"Why, yes, I suppose I do."&#xD;
What,, then ?  he declared that he had not spoken to you."&#xD;
" Why, he wants you to get married to him, and be my little&#xD;
sister ; at least I infer as much from - evidence," replied&#xD;
Sabrina, in some surprise. "You may perhaps remember snub-&#xD;
bing me viciously upon one occasion, about 'red-cheeked&#xD;
men,' and I made up my mind, then and there,-'to keep quiet,&#xD;
R    till you chose to speak first; that was when the yellow opal-&#xD;
jiI~ esced in you; now you glimmer and glow, all blue and violet.&#xD;
He's a noble good fellow, Zoe, as his sister can testify; quite&#xD;
worthy even of you."&#xD;
"Oh, yes ! But you've no idea how absurd he can be. For&#xD;
instance: he is begging me to get married right off, now, and&#xD;
not go back to school any more."&#xD;
"Fie upon my silly brother! I would not have believed it&#xD;
of him. I must set his folly straightly before him - read him&#xD;
a lecture."&#xD;
"Oh, no ! you'needn't, because I am going to do it - get&#xD;
married, I mean."&#xD;
"Oh, you are "answered Sabrina, looking rather blank.&#xD;
"Yes, I am. And you will have to be bridesmaid; so there's an&#xD;
end of your school-days for the present, if not forever, you see."&#xD;
"I don't see that at all. You may marry our Peter if you&#xD;
like, but I shall finish my education at Rosenbloom."&#xD;
"That's how I talked at Peter ; but he said I had education&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

enough to keep hiin in a flurry ; and though he promised, of his&#xD;
own accord, not to hurry me, and wait ever so long if I would&#xD;
only agree to take him at some far-off period in the dim future,&#xD;
here he is, you see, in the greatest pucker imaginable ; no time&#xD;
will do but now !r"&#xD;
"Put him off ; tell him you wont," suggested Sabrina.&#xD;
"Well, I don't know as I ought to do that. Mamma-is so&#xD;
delicate ; perhaps it is best for me to remain near her; and,&#xD;
at any rate, ske kissed me and cried ever so much, and thanked&#xD;
me when I told her. I shall have to be married sometime, you&#xD;
know ; so a little sooner or later doesn't matter much. But&#xD;
Peter has got to do one thing."&#xD;
"Well, dear, and that is-?"&#xD;
"lie has got to come here and live in our house."&#xD;
"I don't believe Peter Bradshaw will consent to that."&#xD;
" Oh, yes, he will. He says thi farm is in a dreadful state&#xD;
and the place wants a master. 'He intends to lease it of&#xD;
manna, and put it intoshape. And he conversed ever so long&#xD;
about drainage, and subsoil plough, and patent hand-rollers, and&#xD;
Alderneys, and Dorkings, and Southdowns, and black Ham-&#xD;
burghs.&#xD;
"A pretty mix you make of our Peter's farming talk !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Sabrina, laughing. "What a stupid, silly fellow, to pour&#xD;
such heathen Greek into the ears of a couple of fine ladies 1"&#xD;
"Not at all, Miss Bradshaw. He is not a silly fellow : I&#xD;
like it. I don't understand much of it, but it sounds hearty&#xD;
and nice. He shows his teeth while he is talking, and his-dim-&#xD;
ple in the left cheek gets deeper'every day ; and it is suggest-&#xD;
ive (the talk, I mean) of whole barns full of ripe yellow wheat,&#xD;
and orange pumpkins, and ears of corn, and things, and cellars&#xD;
filled with delicious' root-a-beggar apples, and Murphy pears,&#xD;
and Winter Nelis potatoes.''"&#xD;

Zoe threw a triumphant glance at Sabrina, after this oit.&#xD;
burst of enthusiasm ; and she was decidedly put out by her&#xD;
outburst of merry laughter.&#xD;
" Peter don't laugh at me," pouted she. "I always nod at&#xD;
him in the right places, and say over enough of the long words&#xD;
at the ends of the sentences to show that I'm attending.&#xD;
Mamma gets more puzzled than I, and she don't even try to&#xD;
nod, but pulls on such, a helpless face, that I have to go and&#xD;
kiss her directly. You know Unle Dick always took care of&#xD;
our affairs as long as he lived ; and I daresay Mr. Scraper isn't&#xD;
a very good manager. But Peter will set it all right. He&#xD;
knows all about it."&#xD;
w'Ohi the nonsense of the ideal,&#xD;
With red-cheeked Peter for the real ! "'&#xD;
&#xD;
laughed Sabrina. "But I do know that my big brother holds&#xD;
an opinion with that enthusiastic Genesee farmer who con-&#xD;
sidered it a fatal mistake to describe heaven as a 'city,' when&#xD;
it would be so intensely attractive under figure of a model&#xD;
farm with Yankee improvements."&#xD;
".I think so too, I'm sure. Isn't our pretty Roaring River&#xD;
much nicer than any city?  God made the country ; men make&#xD;
the towns. I don't believe he will ever shut us up behind.&#xD;
walls, even though builded of all manner- of precious stones."&#xD;
"(Wel, Zoe, you have made, up your mind to°'change your&#xD;
condition, as Deacon Proddy says; and you have it all fixed&#xD;
and settled. I don't see'how it ever comes to -pass that a girl&#xD;
brings herself to say 'yes,' and nierge her individuality into her&#xD;
master's. Poor Hetty Peebles used to hook onto me at school,&#xD;
and bore me ,with sighing=confidences. She said it was heart-&#xD;
breaking torefuse so many, and she was so fond of going over-&#xD;

can it be possible that all our school-pleasures are over ? "&#xD;
"Sabrina, look at me !" flashed out Zoe. "Are you not en-&#xD;
gaged?"&#xD;
" Engaged ? no indeed ! ". Sabrina threw back her head.&#xD;
" Do you love Henrique Zambrano?"&#xD;
"No," very decidedly.&#xD;
"rOr Chandy?"                . .&#xD;
"Love the haughty boy Chandos?     e handsome play-&#xD;

of our excellent Deacon Williams, I do, in a manner, as you&#xD;
may say, seemingly, love Sir John ; but prospectively as a lover,&#xD;
and then as a husband - oh, no !"&#xD;
" Well now, be true, Sabrina --:Sam Slaughton ? "&#xD;
Still "no," but more faintly, andvith rising color in her face.&#xD;
" I like them all, Zoe-; but as for love -nonsense ! My&#xD;
father's daughter loves .her home, and her ease, and her sweet&#xD;
liberty. .Why, Zoe, you and I are only sixteen years old !"&#xD;
" I shall be seventeen next month, dear. Mamma was mar-&#xD;
ried at seventeen. She approves of early marriages."&#xD;
" Oh, of course it is all right if you like it. I'm'sure Ishall&#xD;
richly enjoy having you for my sister."&#xD;
"Yes, dear, thank you ! The samer:to you" (bowing).&#xD;
"Peter says he will take you to Paris with us next year."&#xD;
" Oh, will he ! Very kind of Peter, Im sure," replied Sa-&#xD;
brina, loftily. "I'm not in the habit of being taken about. I&#xD;
prefer to make my own plans mostly."&#xD;
Zoe laughed, like the elf of mischief she was.&#xD;
"Very well- You will make your own plans to be my&#xD;
bridesmaid, of course." I shall have Pauline for the other,,nd&#xD;

make a gay little couple. And I want our Chris, if I can&#xD;
match her with a mate."&#xD;
"rWould it not becruel to ask her. We know very well that&#xD;
her mother would not furnish her dresses; and, poor, girl, her&#xD;
heart is too sore to taste any pleasure, even if she gets back&#xD;
health enough.&#xD;
"I am afraid so, indeed; but we wont despair. Peter in-&#xD;
tends asking Jan Vedder to stand with you. I rather wanted to&#xD;
have my cousin, Phil Penhurst, from Canadasset, but he says'&#xD;
he does not know him, and he should not like to remember our&#xD;
wedding so intimately mixed up with a perfect stranger. And,&#xD;
besides, Phil is going to be married to that pretty Annie Tuftii,&#xD;
and she mightn't like to have him stand with you, you know.&#xD;
but if you had only known Phil, Sabrina, he'd just suit you, -&#xD;
'grand, gloomy, and peculiar,' -and, of course, it would be&#xD;
much nicer and more comIete if you had a lover - all in; the&#xD;
family, you see. I should enjoy having Chandy and Sam at my&#xD;
wedding, of all things; but there's no knowing, when they will,&#xD;
come home, and Peter wont hear of waiting. He is getting to&#xD;
put on, plenty of airs lately. I shall have to snub him, I'm&#xD;
afraid.'"&#xD;
Well, I like that ! Snub one's lord and master elect ! A&#xD;
man whom I can snub, wont ever suit me. ! "&#xD;
"What a pity about Phil Penhurst ! ,-You couldn't lay a fin-&#xD;
ger upon his dignity. Such high mightiness.! And I know it&#xD;
will be all thrown away on that Annie Tuftii. However, it&#xD;
can't be helped now. And, really and seriously, Sabrinea, I&#xD;
don't see how you can go back to school, because' you will have,&#xD;
to help me select my trousseau. Mamma is such an invalid, I&#xD;
can't have the heart to drag her about among shops ; and I in-&#xD;

shall have to make a journey to New York, and, of course, she&#xD;
will go, and we'll take the greatest care of her. And we'll coax&#xD;
your darling; dear little beauty of a yellow-haired mother to:&#xD;
come along too, and show them off. Such handsome rmammas&#xD;
don't grow on bushes. I like Peter's kinfolk, that's one" com-&#xD;
fort."&#xD;
"Thank you, Zoe! And Peter's kinfolk like you ; that's a&#xD;
still greater comfort."&#xD;
"Yes, of course! And we'll stop at the Metropolitan. I&#xD;
love to stay there, it is so close by every thing, and right over&#xD;
Niblo's. And we'll go -and see Mr. and Mrs. Florence, and&#xD;
have a good hearty cry over that dear, delightful ' Ticket of&#xD;
Leave Man,' and a laugh with Mrs. St. Evremond, given with&#xD;
a roll. Oh, you/must come along,, Sabrina; positively you&#xD;
must !"&#xD;
"When is this important event to be consummated? (as Miss&#xD;
Dulcet says, who is a happy little woman now, by the way).:&#xD;
"'When shall Hymen light'his torch?'&#xD;
" The first of April, - All-Fools' Day. Appropriate, isn't it ?&#xD;
But there is one thing about it :A the fools began with Adam and&#xD;
Eve, and wont end till the last man and woman. Peter had&#xD;
some practical farming reason for wishing it on that day -I&#xD;
forget if it was a cattle-show or a sheep-washing. Oh, I re-&#xD;
member now, --there's to -be a great Agricultural Convention&#xD;
somewhere,- at Chicago, or Hartford, or - well, never mind the&#xD;
place; at any rate, he wants to include it in our wedding trip."&#xD;
" That's Peter all over," replied Sabrina, laughing; "beware&#xD;
Zoe, dear, how you make an issue~ about any thing, or you'll&#xD;
find, to your mortification, that you come in only second best&#xD;

"'m not afraid; Peter always does as I bid him ; I have&#xD;
him in goody training; he knows 'I've ga to have my-own way,&#xD;
and I intend always to keep a steady hand over him. The&#xD;
point now in debate is, the absolute necessity for iPeter's sister&#xD;
to stop at home till it is all over."&#xD;
"Three months ahead! I certainly can't afford to lose so&#xD;
much valuable time, Zoe. The classes would be far in ad-&#xD;
vanceof-me; rand I shall graduate with my friends, or not at&#xD;
all. You can go on with the minor details, and you may count&#xD;
on me for the New York trip and the grand finale ; luckily,-we&#xD;
have vacation in April.&#xD;
"But, Sabrina," said Zoe, rather ruefully, "'I didn't think&#xD;
you would care about going back without me; Pm sure I&#xD;
shall be. too lonely without you.. Why we have been play-&#xD;
mates ever since 'we could walk; half the fun of getting mar-&#xD;

might do that little for your own Zoe; come now, say you will&#xD;

Sabrina, decidedly. "La patience estamere, mais son fruit est&#xD;

how she is to-day ? of a truth she has need of patience; don't&#xD;

"Ah, yes ! but my cousin Phil is not Otho.Groenveldt, nor&#xD;

"Neither-you nor I, Zoe, are for an instant to be compared&#xD;

" Oh, of course, I'm full willing to admit her sup  rity and&#xD;

"You did glimmer with the green opalescence for a while,"&#xD;
said Sabrina, kissing the ripe lips offered to here&#xD;
Before the sun went down, rosy-cheeked Peter drove up to&#xD;
the door, with a perfect chime and clangor of bells ; seated in&#xD;
the new sleigh, he had just got home from Mansuy's, drawn by&#xD;
his ponies. He threw the reins over their backs ; for he had&#xD;
trained them to stand without hitching ; and ran into the wide&#xD;
hall, and looked into-the empty drawing-room. The great arm-&#xD;
chair, which the two girls had vacated, stood before the rug, and&#xD;
the fire shot out some sparks for greeting ; a long clean "early-&#xD;
rose " potatoe, which he had taken from his pocket, as a&#xD;
specimen of his crop, when he came to dinner, lay on the&#xD;
centre-table, among the Christmas gifts. Rainbow Goldsmith&#xD;
(as Pauline was accustomed to call Chris's pussy), was dos.a-dos&#xD;
with Zoe's King Charles, a round ball apiece, in the corner.&#xD;
Peter heard voices upstairs, and he turned from the pleasant&#xD;
picture, and called at the foot in a hearty, cheery way, {for his&#xD;
betrothed.&#xD;
Presently the little gypsy appeared on the landing, arrayed&#xD;
i a black evening 'dress of airy fabric ; the rosy corals de-&#xD;
pending from  her ears; caressing her arms; the diaden&#xD;
above her glossy hair, and 'the necklace rising and falling&#xD;
with every eager breath. She took a flying slide, with her&#xD;
hand on the balusters, and such light patting of her little feet,&#xD;
that she seemed scarcely to touch the stairs; and as swiftly&#xD;
and softly as a wren drops into her nest, she alighted in Peter's&#xD;
strong arms, spread out to receive her.&#xD;
"Oh, Peter !" exclaimed she, making up a -rosy business&#xD;
g.guth, "you've forgotten something very important."&#xD;
S" Pumpkins and beans ! what is it ?" Peter looked anx-&#xD;

"That's a fact," said Peter, sa ping his fingers. "What a&#xD;

" Oh, no, don't, Peter, please. It wouldn't be the same at&#xD;

colored violently.&#xD;
"I don't.like you any more. You ought to agree with me,&#xD;

AN OLD FRIEND IN THE FURNACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
-" a school-girl ! a mere child !" (Heaven keep us from such&#xD;
children-!)&#xD;
Those of our dear readers who went with us through the&#xD;
trials of Christabel, the Widow Goldsmith's daughter, will recall&#xD;
the exploits and schemes of that beautiful blonde whom Chandy&#xD;
named Mopsa Pandora; and to all such as didn't, we would&#xD;
say in the words of the poet, "Buy me, and I will do you&#xD;
good," because we are now to follow out the lives of some old&#xD;
acquaintances.&#xD;
The glamor was removed, the spell broken, and Ruthie&#xD;
could clearly see the drift of the half-suggestions, artful insinu-&#xD;
ations and skilful maneuvres to secure George Blair's attentions&#xD;
and give them the appearance of devotion, when she 'knew it&#xD;
would gall. And the wife, "the little bud of a woman !" could&#xD;
have beaten herself for. so easily lending her silly soul to the&#xD;
furtherance of such exploits. Her vain longings for a grand&#xD;
house, pretty dresses, and rich ftvniture ; her foolish .ambition&#xD;
for a prominent place in society, in which her good sense had gone&#xD;
to sleep, and all the latent weakness of-her nature had struggled&#xD;
to the surface. The small matron khd meant to hide, thought&#xD;
were hidden in her own breast, and lo ! her noble husband&#xD;
had read and/understood --and pronounced upon her - even&#xD;
her secret weakness, her most carefully concealed follies. Belle&#xD;
Brandon had forced an intimacy upon her. It was none of her&#xD;
seeking; and yet it had borne such bitter fruits that she was&#xD;
brought to ask herself the question, " Am I weaker in character&#xD;
than that child, that -school-girl! 'since the strongest should&#xD;
rule?".&#xD;
Mrs. George Blair had an inborn love for womanly pretti-;&#xD;
nesses which had ever h  natural license. Pure-bred ; gentle-&#xD;
folks on both sides ; orph : - at fifteen ; a teacher at sixteen ;&#xD;
and her nineteenth birthdaynot full-orbed,  she was left alone&#xD;
&#xD;
AN OLD FRIEND IN T'E FURNACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
with her child. The only man she had ever loved, had left 'her&#xD;
to work out her life as she could. He was a noble, goodfellow&#xD;
too ; and thought he was giving her back her only chance of&#xD;
happiness, -freedom and a divorce !&#xD;
We are accustomed to expect that marriage will mature the&#xD;
character as by a miracle ; but the tastes and idiosyncrisie'sare&#xD;
not changed by the utterance of the 'responses. The habits and&#xD;
desires do not disappear, nor the individuality, when thre ring&#xD;
is slipped upon the little, smooth finger. The 'bishop's bless-&#xD;
ing may soften for the time the heart of the' white-robed irl&#xD;
whom he is launching into' her untried life, and bring1tears"to&#xD;
her eyes; 'but that, nor even the first husband-kiss; oes not&#xD;
interrupt the current of her sensibilities, nor medamorphoseh r&#xD;

not a thought had ever strayed from her noble giant. Even in&#xD;
her ambitious dreams, he had'been Lord Paramount.&#xD;
She worked at the tangled skein-; and though many things&#xD;
pointed toward Belle Bragxdon, as the - author of  ; certain&#xD;
heliotrope-scented letter, which George had left upon his desk&#xD;
the night of her' great :trouble (when she had spoken bitter&#xD;
words to'her husband, and shut herself into her roon, and had&#xD;
come forth a lonely, desolate woman), and which she kept&#xD;
safely, and pondered much. She had nothing tangible t&amp;amp; fix&#xD;
on; and could not afford her wily enemy the triutnyh of 'iip=&#xD;
braiding her,- or even disclosing to any the secret of her&#xD;
misery. She fastened upon the painful.certainty, that she"had&#xD;
forgotten God, dropped her religion out of her thoughts;her&#xD;
trust was gone ; she had cut loose from safe- moorings and&#xD;
was drifting  drifting. She prayed for a sight of'the 'Friend's&#xD;
face in the gloom, for, a touch of his blessed hand; she cast&#xD;
her griefs and sins at his feet, .and took up' her 'trial. She&#xD;
schooled herself to bide her time, andi'make' no sig'; she&#xD;

how. First, to purchase a costly Bible and psalm-book for the&#xD;
pulpit (it was rumored that Rev. Dr. Perfect had made&#xD;
scathing comments upon the shabbiness of the old ones, when&#xD;
he exchanged with 'Mr. Growing); second, to constitute Mrs.&#xD;
Deacon Williams, and Mrs. Esquire Hitchcock, life-members&#xD;
of the Tract Society ; leaving a balance unaccounted for, which,&#xD;
it leaked out, had been bestowed upon Belle Brandon, in, re-&#xD;
wardfor the active share she had taken in the Fair ; which was&#xD;
so far true, that a vote had been carried in a small gathering&#xD;
of the sisters; from which Mrs. Goldsmith and Dulcet Pettibone&#xD;
were carefully excluded, to present the lovely blonde with an&#xD;
appropriate offering.  But the kind design got somewhat&#xD;
warped, for Deacon Williams laid hands on'the money, to pay&#xD;
for a certain invisible green habit in which Miss Brandon had&#xD;
shone resplendent up at Craigenfels, on the occasion of the&#xD;
great horseback excursion ; and it was a sort of pity too, for she&#xD;
had been minded to invest the money -which she considered&#xD;
farly earned, and had "laid pipe" to get-in jeweler's wares;&#xD;
and gauds and ornaments - so they were rich and costly-&#xD;
were dear and pleasant to her soul.&#xD;
The nine-days wonder which George Bl     sappearance&#xD;
from Roaring River had caused, and for=wh   manner of&#xD;
reasons were assign edsubsided at length; the stand-up tussle&#xD;
over the new church edifice taking off the attention of the peo-&#xD;
ple, and affording no end of opportunities.for personal encoun-&#xD;
ters, wordy battles, and hard names, in which the sisters freely&#xD;
joined without'the ceremony of inquiring whether or no it were&#xD;
a freefight.&#xD;
Old Miss Pettingill, the tailoress, who lived down on the&#xD;
flats and Mrs. Esquire Hitchcock, wagged their tongues over&#xD;
Girges conduct, and tried hard to get up a report, which&#xD;
Mrs  T onWilliams indorsed conecting his stden disap..&#xD;

pearance with Belle Brandon's going; but that was so palpably&#xD;
untrue, that it died without a gasp ; and Adeliza Euphemia said&#xD;
" she'd always known that that 'ere Blair had another family&#xD;
down South, and probable he'd gone to visit 'em," - adding,&#xD;
"You needn't mention it from me, but I heerd on't from good&#xD;
authority ; such folks makes me drefful sick of gettin' married.&#xD;
Don't they yeau ? Oh, forlornity ! "&#xD;
The gifted Adeliza also paid a-visit of condolence and espial&#xD;
.to. the Horseshoe, without great results. She found 4tuth&#xD;
quiet and collected, and ready to parry all their inquiries with&#xD;
civil indirection,-little Ruth, who never took anybody into&#xD;
her confidence. There was one true young heart, though, to&#xD;
whom love gave clairvoyance to understand her grief without&#xD;
the need of words.&#xD;
She soon settled upon her course : the school was opened&#xD;
to her. The, teacher had got married; Miss Dulcet Pettibone&#xD;
had became the wife of a Gonecusset Captain Slocum, and was&#xD;
keeping house, with vast enjoyment of the change -in her conr&#xD;
dition. Therefore Ruth fitted her, parlor (where she had&#xD;
been so happy, and where her mother's Pleyel stood close to a&#xD;
wonderful barge -chair) with desks and benches, and bought a&#xD;
globe, and a jugof ink, and some maps, and then set to work&#xD;
to drum up her pupils ; but she put the barrel-chain out of&#xD;
sight first. George helped her to make it, and he whistled her&#xD;
cradle-song while he was work g ; and sung it all througA&#xD;
ever so many times.&#xD;

The bird is asleep on the tree,&#xD;

She: opened the piano, and played the melody, and sang it&#xD;

her false, tried to creep in and chill her soul. Butt after. every&#xD;
perusal of his last letter she drove it out, and believed-triumph-&#xD;
antly in his great truth and goodness.&#xD;
At any rate, her duty was plain. ,She must live on, faithful&#xD;
over a few things-; and try to be patient and to be useful... And&#xD;
she bridged over the dismal present, which she accepted as a&#xD;
time of penance and trial and labor, with hopes of reunited hap-&#xD;
piness -hopes which a less elastic nature might have felt no&#xD;
ground for. - And she had hours when her eyes filled with rare&#xD;
light, and her face cleared and glowed; and she gave herself&#xD;
up to the joy of dreaming of her absent husband. His mathe-&#xD;
matical books.-and instruments were very full of him,-and she&#xD;
studied hard, in her leisure; often laying down the volume to&#xD;
recall -his looks, or burying her face among its leaves, the faint&#xD;
odor of the sandal and cinamon woods he was}fond of using,&#xD;
and which.he kept in his chest among his- books and instrua&#xD;
ments, reminded her of him.,  She remembered how he had&#xD;
tossed up his curls and frowned, and how the abstracted scowl&#xD;
had dissolved-'into a kindly smile, when she had come and&#xD;
dropped a little kiss upon his cheek. Among all her memories,&#xD;

AN OLD FRIEND IN THE FURNACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ruthic soon had a helper she had not expected. It hap.-&#xD;
pened on this wise : There was a young Irish lassie, named&#xD;
Sonsie Eagan, in whom Ruth took a lively interest, and who was&#xD;
a diligent and faithful learner of all kitchen-lore which the&#xD;
'thrifty housewife, Mrs. Deacon Williams, could impart by pre-&#xD;
cept and example. And besides this, the girl having one of those&#xD;
restless intellects which must push on, she picked up crumbs&#xD;
of all sorts of knowledge, coaxed or surprised out of the rest of&#xD;
the household.. The Deaconess was forced to confess that Son-&#xD;
sie was a "likely, capable girl," and would have been sorry to&#xD;
part with her. But she dodged or put aside all talk of wages,&#xD;
and gave her faithful maid just as few garments as she could.&#xD;
Mrs. Eagan knew what starving and deep trouble was; but she&#xD;
was getting a decent living now, and she grumbled, and told&#xD;
Sousie to "lave it, and niver put another day into it."  But the&#xD;
girl laughed, and refused with some of her rich, racy Irish fun,&#xD;
and= stuck at her post undaunted by hardship or abuse..&#xD;
".I'll learn all t' auld dragon can tache me, mother, before I&#xD;
lave her ;" said she, " and when IAn ready, I'll find me a ser-&#xD;
vice aisy enough. I must be perfect fust, though ; and she's&#xD;
the tidiest, clanest body, wid her gret fist, that you iver met wid.&#xD;
She just; takes hold"of her work by the handle. It's a real&#xD;
pleasure to see her -turn it off, as perfect'as Ieads; though we&#xD;
might get dumb in her service, for 'tis ne'er a'lilt nor a jig that&#xD;
she'll have piped up in her Ihitchen if she can help it, no mather&#xD;
how , arm the merry sun shines above, nor the light hearts&#xD;
dance inside of us. But danht you'fret, mother. I'll get a ser-&#xD;
vice among the Roaring Rivers,' one fine day   I've -had&#xD;
egu h of the Gonecussets ; they're mostly of the one stripe,&#xD;
barn' Captin Slocum and Mr. Bisbee, and the best 'of the&#xD;
others is just a dose for a grown person."&#xD;
'On the morning of the departure of the young scholars" for&#xD;
&#xD;
Rosenbloom (that was in early autumn, you know), after seeing&#xD;
t e last of Chris, and watching the puffing engine round the&#xD;
bend, Sousie made haste to keep a promise she had given "her&#xD;
white angel," to find a home for the great pussy, Rainbow,&#xD;
whom Chris dearly loved. So she went up to the widow's and&#xD;
coaxed the deft Egyptian with nuts and raisins, of which he&#xD;
was extravagantly fond ; and taking him in her arms, she set&#xD;
off at a good brisk pace on her two-mile walk. He lay in her&#xD;
embrace, with his great, double fore-paws dangling, his mottled&#xD;
tail switching, and his yellow eyes winking and blinking in the&#xD;
sunshine. And he uttered short, little "permous," like barks'&#xD;
occasionally, as his sharp,. pointed ears caught a rustle among&#xD;
the leaves ; luxuriously enjoying the ramble till they. got into&#xD;
Long Meadow ; when he either "smelled a mice " or got sight&#xD;
of a wood-pigeon, or a chipmunk. At all events, he refused to&#xD;
be carried any more, though he raced at Sonsie's side gleefully&#xD;
when she made top-speed, and followed, like a dog, when she fell&#xD;
into a breathless walk, holding her sides and laughing at the fun&#xD;
it was.' And he dived into all the bushes, lapped water out of&#xD;
the running-brooks, and tried his claws on the great tree-trunks.&#xD;
Old Miss Petingill welcomed him joyfully; being, as she de-&#xD;
clared, "clean out of cats ; " and she ambled off into the but-&#xD;
tery, and brought out a pat of butter and greased his double&#xD;
paws.&#xD;
" There ! " exclaimed she, sitting down in her low rocking-&#xD;
chair, with her case-knife in her hand, and gazing at him blandly&#xD;
through her silver-rimmed spectacles, --" there ! I expect that'll&#xD;
wont the creater good. It's the sov'reignest thing I because, you&#xD;
see, they've got to lick, to clean the grease off; and it takes up&#xD;
their minds, so that by the time they've done lickin' they feel to&#xD;
hum."&#xD;

&#xD;
"I think Rainbow feels at home anywheres mostly," said&#xD;
Sonsie, laughing.&#xD;
Law, yes ! he does seem to, and he's, as fat as a pig too,&#xD;
I declare, fort. The widder is a dreadful savin' critter, but&#xD;
'taint likely she'd grudge nothin' o her.only darter."&#xD;
As sharp Sonsie had no fancy for being pumped, she opened&#xD;
her blue eyes wide at the ancient tailoress's feeler, and only re-&#xD;
plied,,&#xD;
" What.a long tail our cat's got 1"&#xD;
Old Miss Petingill laughed.&#xD;
- "The - idea!" said she. " Your're cute, aint you ? 'Tis&#xD;
kinder long, aint it ?  He's a drefful handsome cat ! Come&#xD;
here, Tommy !"&#xD;
Rainbow, having polished off his paws, partook relishingly of&#xD;
the viands offered him, lapped all the milk out of the blue&#xD;
"sercer," washed his nose, and then set himself to explore ;&#xD;
smelling at the orifices which suggested mice, running down&#xD;
cellar, diving behind -the pork-barrel, and coming forth embroi-&#xD;
dered with cobwebs ; racing upstairs and resting, for the space&#xD;
o a couple of minutes or so, on the spinster's maiden couch;&#xD;
which was pounded up as high and round as well-punished&#xD;
geese feathers could be, and covered by a Turkey red and white&#xD;
sunflower bed-quilt. Then he examined the ig.pen ; uttering&#xD;
his sharp " permous," - short barks of greeting in answer to the&#xD;
grunts of the two white porkers who were to buy their owner a&#xD;
"winter-rig " when they should " shuffle off this mortl coil."&#xD;
And he took a roll in the bed of catnip,-and- a nibble at it.&#xD;
Then he dug out a. couple- of meadow moles, and tasted the&#xD;
tender bits. And so, having exhausted the rescources of the&#xD;
maiden's: establishment, he went back to look-,for Sonsie; and&#xD;
finding her not, he made a bee-line for Brookside, where he ar-&#xD;
rived about an hour before sundown,- as fresh as new.&#xD;
&#xD;
A2&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
During the first weeks of Christabel's absence, he sought her&#xD;
daily in all her accustomed haunts ; but having considered the&#xD;
subject carefully, with his eyes shut, and his paws tucked under&#xD;
him, he-made up his mind she was really gone, and not coming&#xD;
back any more ; and after that he cut loose from the premises.&#xD;
He pondered over his favorite duckling a good while,-and had&#xD;
half a mind to eat him up out of harm's way; but it was only a&#xD;
passing temptation; the best of cats are liable to such ; and&#xD;
ducky lived on to flash the sunshine from her green feathers and&#xD;
dip her polished bill into the brook ; and in due time to hatch&#xD;
out a pretty brood of muscovies of her own.&#xD;
Rainbow never asked any thing of anybody, but he looked as&#xD;
sleek' and comfortable, and as "up to snuff," as ever. When&#xD;
Sonsie got a bit of a holiday, she spent it in his company ; and&#xD;
though she 'read and studied all the while, he was no ways put&#xD;
out ; evidently looking upon such a course as legitimate and&#xD;
proper, and just what his mistress would have done in like cir-&#xD;
cumstances.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
SONSIE GOES NUTTING, AND HAS AN ADVENTURE.&#xD;
HERE had been a hoar-frost the night before, and the&#xD;
chesnut-burrs were open, and. the boys and girls&#xD;
were- out -amongst the trees poking away the brown&#xD;
leaves and gathering the great, shining. nuts into their bas-&#xD;
kets. Sonsie saw them go, by the Deacon's, when she was&#xD;
sweeping the sidewalk, and she heaved a natural sigh that she&#xD;
was so shut out from allchildish enjoyments.&#xD;
" I'm Agoing a nutting this blessed afternoon" said she lto&#xD;

Nora, the new cook; as she dumped her splint broom behind&#xD;
the kitchen door.&#xD;
"Nary a nut, me girleen !" spoke back Nora. " The auld&#xD;
dragon'll sing ye another song to that, if ye pitch yer tune in&#xD;
her hearin'."&#xD;
" I'm going a nutting," repeated Sonsie, resolutely. " The&#xD;
blessed sunshine is for me as well as them girls. And I'll be&#xD;
prancin' up a good time this evenin', anyhow !"&#xD;
"Ah, wisha ! but the red roses and the flax-flowers- that we&#xD;
used to be gittin' those times to home -tsit, tsit ! -ochone ! "&#xD;
said Nora, wiping her hot face, and trying her iron against it.&#xD;
Sousie had been upon her feet ever since day-dawn, scrubbing&#xD;
and cleaning, and had worked faithfully through all her tasks ;&#xD;
and "filled in the chinks of her time," as she was ordered to&#xD;
be sure and do, with the carpet-rags, which the Deaconess kept&#xD;
on hand for that purpose. After the dinner-dishes were washed,&#xD;
and rinsed, and drained, and wiped, and polished, and the dish-&#xD;
cloths were scalded and dried and folded, and the last one of&#xD;
her many duties done, she presented horself, and boldly made&#xD;
her request. Her mistress evinced only disgust ; but Sonsie&#xD;
threw in some hints about the chamber-maid's place at the.&#xD;
Millville House, to be hers for the asking (a string she had&#xD;
clanged too -often in the dame's ears of late, as she. knew very&#xD;
well she could not have such a girl as Sonsie for the price of&#xD;
half a dozen chamber-maids), she, with the sourest of visages,&#xD;
gave her an hour's leave.&#xD;
"An hour to go to Bradshaw's woods and back again P' said&#xD;
Sonsie, walking away. "I'll be back when I come, and that'll&#xD;
be when I've me fun all out and me basket full of nuts ; and&#xD;
time enough too for the hard-hearted old -dragon. A day's&#xD;
work is tin hours, and I've put in fourteen already, rinin' the&#xD;

Dressed- as tidily as she could be in her bits of duds, she&#xD;
swung her basket onto her arm, and threw a merry jibe back to&#xD;
Nora (whose thoughts were still lingering in the green pastures&#xD;
of "the place to home"), as the walked away. The golden&#xD;
and scarlet maple leaves fluttered down before her, and she&#xD;
paused now and then and picked up the finest, discarding and&#xD;
replacing as more gorgeous specimens attracted - her color-&#xD;
loving eyes. And sitting down on a log, she wove them deftly&#xD;
together and .garlanded them around the straw hat she wore&#xD;
(it was a cast-off of the Deacon's, which she had cut down and&#xD;
trimmed with bands of her own plaiting); and she stood up&#xD;
and gazed down at the image the round pond showed her -&#xD;
she standing on its brink inside the margin of -brown -leaves,&#xD;
and gazing into its depths, black and still-- and she winked&#xD;
knowingly at the eyes which laughed up at her.&#xD;
"'Tis a pair of round cheeks that ye have, hinney, anyhow,"&#xD;
said she, "thanks to the Deacon's good praties !"&#xD;
She searched and called for. Rainbow, but he would not&#xD;
come ; and she felt as though half her pleasure was lost in his&#xD;
absence. In the edge of the chestnut 'wood, she- saw a column&#xD;
of blue smoke shooting straight up into the sky, and then&#xD;
floating away to mingle with the mists on the mountain, and she&#xD;
made another loitering pause to watch its As .she did so, she&#xD;
heard an odd scratching and pawing among the dried leaves,&#xD;
and the- heavy switch of a lithe whip, followed by shouting,&#xD;
wheezy laughter. Though her heart beat- quick,it iwas not be-&#xD;
cause her stout Irish courage failed her.&#xD;
" Au-ough ! ther 's divelment.beyond that. gret knowe,"&#xD;
said she. "I. must-be hurryin'."  And she henttQ the hill and&#xD;
climbed fleetly and swift, as a hare runs to eart. Her flying&#xD;
feet cleared the low fence dividing the meadow from thewood.&#xD;
lot, and carried.herdround the old gray rock,.which roselike a&#xD;

Bax Williams sat on the ground, hugging his knees,. and see-&#xD;
sawing back and forth in ecstatic delight before an old stump,&#xD;
in the hollow of which he had kindled a fire.&#xD;
There was some object between him and that, which he&#xD;
stopped now and then to 'contemplate in savage glee ; and&#xD;
Sonsie held her breath while he picked a willow off a pile "of&#xD;
cuttings beside him, and ,;struck a couple of sharp blows;&#xD;
which were followed-by a fearful cry of pain, and a struggle for&#xD;
life among the withered leaves. 9The blood swept through-the&#xD;
veins of the young Irish girl. She knew, without looking, what&#xD;
it meant ; and she leaped on with a swift bound. Poor Rain-&#xD;
bow, fallen into the power of-his enemy at last ! his fore-paws&#xD;
were caught fast in a double steel-trap, and he.crouched on the&#xD;
ground helpless, suffering, aid at the mercy of his savage tor-&#xD;
mentor, from whose composition "bowels of compassion " had&#xD;
been entirely left out, and the rapidly kindling stump only a&#xD;
little way 6ff; around which the forked flames were already&#xD;
creeping in frightftl haste. The poor dumb creature must have&#xD;
been in torture fpr along time; because his mouth was covered&#xD;
with foam, and there was quite a little pool of blood around&#xD;
the trap, which was firmly secured, to the ground.&#xD;
g'Auough    murther! further!" It was an eldritch screech&#xD;
with which S onsisprang upon Bax. She. clutched his sandy&#xD;
crop inher firm, strong, little fist.4&#xD;
"This is the way ye'r playing' hookey, an'. ye' mother thinks&#xD;

&#xD;
her attentions, and being an arrant coward as well as bully, he&#xD;
was at first too much terrified to think of defending himself;&#xD;
but he managed to struggle to his feet and get loose, and his&#xD;
scrubby hair stood out like an ill-used besom with Sonsie's un-&#xD;
expected manipulations. All the savage brute in the boy raged&#xD;
as he backed away a step or two, pulled down his jacket, and&#xD;
puffed and blowed, and glared it the girl, whose eyes blazed&#xD;
and deepened with indignation.&#xD;
"I'd like to strangle you !" said she, fiercely. "Come, has-&#xD;
ten and put yer nasty paws to a decent service, and let out me&#xD;
cat from that, before I scratch the two tiger eyes out of ye!"&#xD;
and Sonsie made up her fists and sprang on, as if she longed&#xD;
to begin.   -/&#xD;
"Just the one I wanted to have come up to my jolly show!"&#xD;
Bax kept out of her reach ; backing away, and picking up a&#xD;
big willow. "You've took a front seat to the performance just&#xD;
in the nick of-time. Dear Rainbow is making his debut. His&#xD;
piece wont last him nigh so long as we could wish, on account&#xD;
of his havin' only nine lives. Lord! I wish for his sake, and&#xD;

a street-sweeper, -- that he'd got a, thousand; and I'd give a&#xD;
dollar if that Christabel Goldsmith was here this minute !"&#xD;
He gave Sonsie's basket a wicked kick which sent it spinning&#xD;
behind the log.&#xD;
" Leave yer brattle, and let out the poor cat !. You've no&#xD;
feeling's at all, barrin' bad ones. I'll set all the Paddies in the&#xD;
factory atye to-morrow if ye don't start lively. I'll whisper to&#xD;

skin. He wont catch cold, neither ; cause, you see, we've got&#xD;
a good fire. I'd a cut off his tail, only I want to sell his plaguy&#xD;
old hide. The holes he is makin' in. his paws, cuttin' round&#xD;
so, wont hurt' em none. You needn't make no fuss ; Miss&#xD;

to you, nohow. But I'm sorry I can't give you a programme.&#xD;
There'wasn't time to get 'em up ; bein' 'bout 'lection time."&#xD;
Sonsie was not squeamish, but she turned deathly sick. She&#xD;
feared it was all over with poor Rainbow, -his merry antics&#xD;
and.wild pranks, and his roving, free life. He lay quite still,&#xD;
with shut eyes. She put her hands to her mouth and screamed.&#xD;
The gray rock threw back her voice; and, Bax, who hushed his&#xD;
jeering talk, with scared face, half expecting Butcher and&#xD;
Kind Duck to appear, laughed and wheezed when the echo&#xD;
died and he saw Sonsie's face of despair.&#xD;
" You see hollerin' wont do a mite of good ; me and you and&#xD;
Rainbow has got the woods all to ourselves this afternoon,&#xD;
quite selledt. When I've licked him all I want to, I'll let you&#xD;
see how neat I can peel him. It's time to touch him up now,&#xD;
he's dozin'off ; you shall see him frisk ; I e'ena'most split my-&#xD;
self laffin' at him.".&#xD;
Sonsie had been gazing at the trap,, while Bax, grinned and&#xD;
talked, and she darted forward, essaying to spring it herself.&#xD;
"You tech that pr' trap, if you dare ! I'll give you such a&#xD;
lickin' as you never got yet ; stand off, ye sneakin' tramp, ye !"&#xD;
She paid no heed to his threats, but stooped and pushed her&#xD;
Singer upon the spring, but it resisted her endeavors. .Bax&#xD;
watched her an instant, and rushed' upon her and struck a&#xD;
stinging blow, which fell smartly across her shoulders ; pro.&#xD;
tected only by her faded old gingham, but she did not give up';&#xD;
. again he plied his willow, bringing both hands to bear, and&#xD;
&#xD;
clenching his teeth: she shuddered and put allher strength to&#xD;
her work.&#xD;
" By golly, I'll kill you!a I'd liefer than not," snarled. Bax;&#xD;
and dropping the whip, he took to his fists, raining blows on&#xD;
her head ; and Sousie got dizzy, and fell forward, pale aiid&#xD;
motionless over her half-dead favorite, wetting her hands and&#xD;
garments in his blood.&#xD;
Jan Vedder came crashing through the bushes, his game-&#xD;
bag on his back, and a cocker spaniel at his heels ; and afar&#xD;
off from the dim woods, came the deep bark of Flirt, the' great&#xD;
sheep-dog, who was following their trail. Jan darted upon Ba,&#xD;
who had stopped dead still, regarding the prostrate girl, with'&#xD;
his fists clenched, and his teeth grinding together; but h ita&#xD;
coward's fear stealing into his savage eyes, and curdling-'in his&#xD;
blood.&#xD;
Seizing him by the nape of the neck, he swung him about,&#xD;
and dashed him down with his bullet-head -in fearful proxifmity&#xD;
to the burning stump; then strided-oser him, and stooped to&#xD;
raise- the Irish girl, who staggered to her feet, and gazed' in be-&#xD;
wilderment around her, striving to collect her thoughts.&#xD;
"You young devil, you've nearly murdered the girl. I never&#xD;
heard such a screech as she gave; 'and what's this? =-=blod!&#xD;
Where's your wound, poor child?"&#xD;
Unconsciously Sonsie glanced from her reeking hands to the&#xD;
trap, and Jan exclaimed, "What the deuce have we here, ehl!&#xD;
Ill-begotten brute, this is your game; no wonder your sister&#xD;
screamed."&#xD;
He pulled open the terrible steel-jaws., "YThere, 'poor rtch!&#xD;
go --if you've life enough left in you; now let me help you rey&#xD;
little girl."&#xD;
Sonsie, still bewildered withthe blows she had got, shook her&#xD;
head, though she heard and saw as in a dream. She stod&#xD;

instinctively and picked up her wounded pet, and sinking down&#xD;
upon a log she began to cry over and kiss him, while he lay&#xD;
passive, with half-shut eyes. Jan looked at her a moment, and&#xD;
his indignation- mastered him; he wheeled about upon Bax&#xD;
who still crouched and glowered, and seizing him by the collar,&#xD;
he dragged him to his feet.&#xD;
" I'll teach you to beat your sister, you cowardly whelp!" said&#xD;
he ; and picking up a stout willow from the pile so carefully&#xD;
selected, and intended for poor Rainbow, he laid it upon his&#xD;
tormentor with a vigorous play of muscle worthy of a boat-&#xD;
swain's mate. The first* few strokes, were borne in sullen,&#xD;
silence-; the next brought out a shower of curses and foul&#xD;
language, and then came abject prayers for mercy.&#xD;
"Oh, dear 1 he's killing me,-Sonsie.; he's killing me ! speak&#xD;
to him; call him off; oh,,dear, oh-oo !"&#xD;
"There, leave that ! Mr. Vedder !" spoke up Sonsie, whom&#xD;
the -cene had ' torouht.4&#xD;
the scene had thoroughly brought back to consciousness,&#xD;
though her face was pale yet, and her teeth were - set. "Stop&#xD;
sir . don't be lettin' yqurself down to the level of that young&#xD;
cub of his mother . Holy St. PatrickrI what divils the best of&#xD;
these browsers hawrels are, to be sure!"&#xD;
Whether Jan Vedder heard her voice or no, he stopped, and&#xD;
threw the writhing boy off, as -he would have done a crawling&#xD;
reptile, and sent tie. stump of the willow after him.&#xD;
"There ! said he, panting, "1 reckon you've got about the&#xD;
best dusting you ever had ii your life; and I advise you to&#xD;
skeddadle before my arm gets rested, or you'll very likely fall&#xD;
heir to the balance of the willows.&#xD;
Bax picked up his cap, jammed it down over his ears, and&#xD;
set off on a jog trot, cursing and snuffing; when he had crossed&#xD;
the fence, and got so -far as to feel safe, he turn d and shook&#xD;
hsfists&#xD;
&#xD;
SONSIE GOES NUTTING.&#xD;
&#xD;
" You drunken Vedder. I'll serve you out for this, before I&#xD;
die, as sure as eggs. You wait till I get big as you, old raw-&#xD;
bones.! then you look out ; .it'll be my turn then."&#xD;
"There, by-by ! better wash your face, the first pond you&#xD;
come to; and be very careful .how you beat your sister, or&#xD;
you'll go from the jail to the gallows with murder on your&#xD;
soul, some of these days."&#xD;
" My sister ! that Irish tramp my sister ! You'll find out&#xD;
who you've been poundin'. My father 'll Just put you through&#xD;
the law without any mittens. That'sso !"&#xD;
As Bax stood still in his tracks, cursing and swearing, and&#xD;
making horrible faces, pulling down his eyes, and sticking out&#xD;
his tongue ; and persisted in his course of conduct, paying no&#xD;
heed to Jan'swords, that young gentleman started after hi in&#xD;
a long, loping run; but before he reached the fence, the horrid&#xD;
little monster's courage: trickled out at his fingers'-ends, and he&#xD;
took himself off at his best pace, and Jan came leisurely back&#xD;
again.&#xD;
" Has he hurt you much, my dear ?" he asked, taking off his&#xD;
soft hat and mopping his hot face, as he stood before Sonsie,&#xD;
and looked kindly down at her and Rainbow.&#xD;
" No, sir; I was a bit dazed ; but I'm all right now,; I'm&#xD;
fearin' that he'll die, though " (patting the cat softly); "his futs&#xD;
is hurted dreadful."&#xD;
Jan examined the wounded paws, with tender care.&#xD;
" This wont kill your pet, my girl: he's good for no end of&#xD;
rats and mice, if he has no injuries beside. I wish I had a bit&#xD;
of oldalinen, I'd dress his wounds for him."&#xD;
"Take me hankercher, sir : 'tis just that, and no more," said&#xD;
Sonsie holding to view a clean tatter, and. drawing up her&#xD;
mouth corners into a comical smile, through her "eie.&#xD;
" That's a fact," replied Jan, laughing, " a fai7 specimen of&#xD;

ventilation, a holy relic." He took it and bound up the mangled&#xD;
paws, and Rainbow seemed to understand well that he was&#xD;
helping him ; for he offered no resistance, and licked Sonsie's&#xD;
hand during, the operation.&#xD;
" You set great store by your pussy, don't you ?" remarked&#xD;
Jan, in reply to Sonsie's thanks.&#xD;
"Indade, but I do then, sir ; he's a broth of a cat hisself ; but&#xD;
I love him most for the sake of Miss Chris ; she sort o' left him&#xD;
to me care, and she goin' to school. 'Tis the white angel to me&#xD;
intirely that the pretty'lady is, from the first night i ever sit&#xD;
eyes on her holding a loaf.of white bread in her two little hands,&#xD;
and smilin' into me eyes. Ah, sure, Mr. Vedder, I'd fall down&#xD;
and adore her, 'just if she bid me. Yes, Rainbow's her cat,&#xD;
and he knows more nor half the men."&#xD;
"Miss Chris?" said Jan, ignoring the doubtful ending of&#xD;
Sonsie's speech. "That should be Christabel Goldsmith ; the&#xD;
sour widow's fair daughter ; the marvellous musician, scholar,&#xD;
poet; the; famous horsewoman. She and I rode a gay race once."&#xD;
"The same ! sure, sir; there can be but one Miss Chris in&#xD;
the world; any more than there'd shine on us two moons in&#xD;
the blue night-sky."&#xD;
"And pray, who are you, my dear," said Jan, in a puzzle.&#xD;
"Sonsie Eagan is 'the first letters of'me name, at' your ser-&#xD;
vice, sir; you'll excruge me risin' up, seem' as me lap is full of&#xD;
Rainbow.:&#xD;
Assued of the safety of her pet, the mercurial spirits of the&#xD;
warm-hearted Irish lassie mounted apace ; and her eyes shone,&#xD;
and danced, and her 'lips smiled upon' the astonished young&#xD;
hunter, who looked well at her, which he had scarcely done&#xD;
before. There was nothing attractive in her faded 'old gar-&#xD;

boldly to his, but yet with absolute chaste modesty. She had&#xD;
grown a head taller in the half year, which had passed since&#xD;
Ruth Blair found her sitting in the straw, and half-starved, at&#xD;
the old red school-house, and though her purple-black hair was&#xD;
cropped, it lay in heavy masses about her head ; -and her deep&#xD;
blue eyes (real Irish eyes) looked at him mischievously from&#xD;
beneath her arched black brows; her skin was fine and clear&#xD;
as it could be and milky white ; and her wholesome cheeks had&#xD;
the rich red of the damask rose, with lips to match; and her&#xD;
figure firm, supple, well-rounded, and as straight as an arrow.&#xD;
"Ah ! you are a wide-awake lassie ; and you can be very&#xD;
merry, I know. You might be a gay partner fdr a reel; and that&#xD;
arm of yours would pull a firm oar. I am very lucky to meet&#xD;
you up here, particularly as you needed assistance ; and if you&#xD;
will tell me where you~ belong, I'll see you safe home ; for your&#xD;
enemy, who declines the honor of brotherhood, though he might&#xD;
be proud to acknowledge the relationship (I'm sure I should&#xD;
be), may be lurking in wait for you somewhere."&#xD;
" He's safe off by this time, sir ; and 'twould be small loss if&#xD;
he niver showed his face again among decent folks. I should&#xD;
dool to call such a speckled loon my brother. I'm a true&#xD;
Irish lassie, wid niver a drop of Yankee blood in me lane veins&#xD;

"The Deacon's son!" said Jan, laughing "Well, the worthy&#xD;
papa, whoever he may be, can't shirk the doctrine of total ,de-&#xD;

your face; forgive me the blundering insult to your 'clean&#xD;
Irish blood,' and let me take care of you home."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir; I don't need any particular care. I'm able&#xD;
to take my own part, pretty much; but I'm obliged to you, all&#xD;
the same. I'm thinkin' I'll just go to Miss Ruthie this evenin.'&#xD;
I'd rather not face the ould dragon. I've a dozen of ridges al-&#xD;
ready around my shoulders; and 'tisme belief she'd cross them&#xD;
wid plenty of the, same stripe, along of that dirty blackguard,&#xD;
and I'd always be having' to keep.him in order, leastways, 'tis as&#xD;
well to go home no more.&#xD;
"By the old dragon, you mean your respected mother, I&#xD;
suppose ?" said Jan, laughing.&#xD;
" You're wrong there, sir. I hope I'm better bred than to be&#xD;
callin' me mother names; and if I was to spake at all of her to&#xD;
a stranger, I'd liken her the pretty flax-flower, or the quiet snow-&#xD;
drop that grows aneath the hedges. It.is me big mistress, the&#xD;
Deacon's wife, that I'm speakin' of; and she's all that and more.&#xD;
I know you quite well, Mr. Vedder; I've opened the door to ye&#xD;
often and often, when ye used to come courtin' to Miss Belle&#xD;
those times I lived with Mrs. Williams.&#xD;
"Oh, the deuce you have!" replied Jan, coloring up.&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, sir," answered Sonsie, enjoying his confusion;&#xD;
"and I always took a smell at the bookays ye sent up ; and I&#xD;
helped Miss Belle to dress for all the drives ye used to be takin&#xD;
her, when. 'ye come up in the phetton wid them bonnie red&#xD;

to afnd little pleasure in these reminiscences  "You should have&#xD;
e o gh to do to carry yourself, after your little scene. I hope&#xD;
y don' intend to-make love in the sane fierce; fashion."&#xD;
"I don't know sir I'm sure ; I haen'rtried that yet; I shall,&#xD;
soon as I. get .a good chance. I must have sweethearts first.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I've kept nieself alive to catch Miss Belle's pretty ways: she's&#xD;
a good one at it."&#xD;
Jan sat down on the log, and heaved a deep sigh. Sonsie&#xD;
started back and put her hand before her nose, with a disgusted&#xD;
grimace.&#xD;
"What's in the wind now, my Irish beauty !" exclaimed Jan,&#xD;
looking up and meeting, with surprise, her disdainful face.&#xD;
"Pah ! you've been drinking, sir," spoke up Sonsie, boldly&#xD;
and fearlessly.&#xD;
Jan curiously surveyed her modest eyes, which looked full in&#xD;
to his ; her screwed-up lips, ripe and provoking, and her white&#xD;
neck, and her round, fresh-colored arm, and the little firm, well-&#xD;
shapen hand, she held up so meaningly; and pretty soon he&#xD;
answered, -&#xD;
" Well, and what if I haver"&#xD;
"I wouldn't do it, sir, if I were Mr. Vedder -- a born gentle-&#xD;
man ! A drunkard is a nasty beast, not fit to touch orlook&#xD;
at. I'd never in the world be it."&#xD;
" Let housewives make a skillet of my brain," said Jan mu-&#xD;
singly, "if this is not a queer way to accost a gentleman ; but&#xD;
she's more than half right, I'm afraid.. Still, she'swrong too ;&#xD;
for I'm no drunkard, at least, not yet."&#xD;
"Your face is. awful red, sir."&#xD;
"My face 1" exclaimed Jan, passing his hand up and dow&#xD;
his cheek, and looking sideways at Sonsie. "That is the ,Sun&#xD;
and wind, my girl."&#xD;
She shook her head and pursed up incredulous lips.&#xD;
" Tis whisky; and, by the same token, yer head, «hich shuld&#xD;

now, I'll tell you something. You're'so ready at speaking your&#xD;
mind and giving advice, you may give me a little more. What&#xD;
would you do, if you had a trouble you couldn't get rid of?&#xD;
I'ye tried hunting, and i've tried fishing ; but, 'tis no go."&#xD;
" What is your trouble, that ye take the liquor to be rid of,&#xD;
sir, if you wouldn't nnd naming it to me?" questioned Sonsie,&#xD;
with the true Irish mingling of wild freedom and sweet tender-&#xD;
ness in her clear tones, and her bold, modest air. "And you&#xD;
such a brave well-fashioned gentleman !&#xD;
"I'm in love, child"  Jan looked into his soft hat, and care-&#xD;
uly spelled out the  'Nobby" in the blue silt crown-lining.&#xD;
"1ead over ears :inlove; and I think  indeed I'm sure -the&#xD;
gay ladly doesn't care a rush for me."&#xD;
" You may take an oath of it on the old Gatlad-of-Howth ;&#xD;

therticdsp words, enriched with their racy brogue, -" Sonsie,&#xD;

you must not say"' flit.' F-o-o-t spells foot, you perceive."&#xD;
"Thanks, friendly sir," she replied gravely ; " so it does; I'll&#xD;
remember. I'm always grateful for good advice."&#xD;
" So am I," replied Jan, smiling. " And soyou think I atn a&#xD;
drunkard, Sonsie, do you ?"&#xD;
" People say it of you, Mr.:Vedder. They say, Poor lad, he' s&#xD;
just rnin' his self and braking the sweet-heart of his-purty&#xD;
little lady mother, and him the last son and prop of the family."&#xD;
Jan sat drumming on his hat, and gazing down the hill in si-&#xD;
lence, and Sonsie had too much tact or modesty to interrupt the&#xD;
current of his meditations.&#xD;
" By Jove ! this blueeyed emerald, whose mother is like the&#xD;
flax-flower, is a- free-spoken preacher," he thought; "andsvery&#xD;
likely she's more than half right.. ?eter hinted something: the&#xD;
other day: he has been thinking or hearing in the same vein.&#xD;
My mother never looked a sideways look at me in her life:; but&#xD;
neither would she, if I broke. her heart, I suppose. They call&#xD;
me, 'poor Vedder,' do they? I'd like to'catch anybody with the&#xD;
word on his lips. I'd knock it down his throat. I usedtosee&#xD;
the boys take after old Pettibone. i'ye helped him out. of the&#xD;

'poor Pet;' and his wife went to the grog-shop and begged. the&#xD;

when I like. I am no slave to my appetites; no nor to other&#xD;
people's whims either, if it comes to that. I shall do. as I&#xD;

He reached his hand absently behind him, and took out from&#xD;
his pocket a leathern flask.&#xD;
"What are you going to do, Mr. Vedder ?" exclaimed Son-&#xD;
sie, drawing away in sorrowful surprise.&#xD;
"Just;treat resolution, my good child !"  He held it up be-&#xD;
fore her and shook it, and listened to the "chicker " of the fra-&#xD;
grant-liquor. "Pure Irish whisky," said he ; and he pulled off&#xD;
the cup and half filled it. " Here's long life to yqp, and I, and&#xD;
pussy, Sonsie ; and confusion to our enemies !&#xD;
He drank it oft; replaced the cup, and met the girl's re-&#xD;
proachful, indignant, disappointed glance, with a look half-&#xD;
foolish, half-bravado.  -&#xD;
"I hope Miss Belle will jilt ye, Mr. Vedder ; you deserve it !&#xD;
She's a very proud young lady, and should think too highly of&#xD;
herself'to marry wid a whisky-jug! and that's what ye ar', then,&#xD;
just entirely '"&#xD;
' Come, come. be, careful what you say ; you might make&#xD;
me angry. 'Tis a lonesome place up here, Sonsie; and as to&#xD;
that, Ithink no small beer of myself; and if Miss Brandon wont&#xD;
have me,: there are plenty of handsome girls, good waltzers,&#xD;

fellow as I am for a husband  Oh, yes, Sonsie ! I don't need&#xD;
go begging ; not if I drank,till I fell under the table every day&#xD;

lips, and the baleful fire of it in yer eyes all red and blood-&#xD;
shot."&#xD;
"You think so ?" asked Jan, half'insolently, half in bitterness.&#xD;
"You betray lamentable ignorance of polite society, child, and&#xD;
of your dear, artless sex. You should see the piles of notes in&#xD;
my waste basket, and the sweet looks I get from the young&#xD;
beauties, and the caresses from the mammas ; and you should&#xD;
taste the jolly old brandy and the choice wines the papas bring&#xD;
out in my honor. / But I don't care that for them all!1 I'm&#xD;
tired of the whole string ! They all talk just alike, and-go into&#xD;
ecstacies over the same things. Belle Brandon is a brick IShe&#xD;
can drive four-in-hand, and she plays a capital game of euchre.&#xD;
She's original, and spirited, and clever, and afraid of nothing !&#xD;
But, as you say, she does- not care a pin-for me ; and Jive&#xD;
thought my last thought about her. By Jove, Sonsie1 ;ye a&#xD;
fancy for you. I'll pass by the ladies and. I'll make love'to&#xD;
you. You've got a bright eye, full of mischief, and a thrilling,&#xD;
sweet voice ;, y can sing, I'll engage. I like. your racy&#xD;
tongue, whidh tells your fresh thoughts in such a charming, rich&#xD;
brogue. I'll buy you a Steinway, and you shall have lessons.&#xD;
I'll give you horses, and dresses, and jewels ;- every- thing you&#xD;
ask me for. And one gay morning you will wake up from your&#xD;
rosy slumber and find yourself a fine lady, as fine as the finest&#xD;
of them."&#xD;
He tried to put his armaround her waist, and bro l this&#xD;
mouth close to her's as if he would kiss her ; but she  ther&#xD;
eyes fixed on his.face, and. flashed a look at, him, which fully&#xD;
illustrated her power to take her own part; and caused him to&#xD;
draw back, looking foolish.&#xD;
"You are qite,.right,sir, to insult me," said she, proudly,&#xD;

is far to good to mate wid a drunkard ! And, by the same&#xD;
token, yer not the pathern of a husband for a clean-skinned,&#xD;
right-minded Irish lassie. Faugh ! what a whiff of raw whisky !&#xD;
Yer very breath is burning up wid it ! I'm sick of yes,.entirely!"&#xD;
She drew herself away with her head up, showing her white&#xD;
throat, and began pick up Rainbow into her apron, getting&#xD;
ready to go.&#xD;
"I thank ye kindly, Mr. Vedder, for yer goodness to me&#xD;
agd me poor cat, and I wish, wid all me soul, that ye was a&#xD;
better fellow."&#xD;
Jan laughed, and his eyes deepened; he, involuntarily&#xD;
stigh,1tened his broad shoulders, interested and aroused.&#xD;
"Pen't leavene,;Sonsie. I've made an ass of myself, that's&#xD;
plain;but :don't, bear malice. I didn't kiss you, you know.&#xD;
Youcan afford to forgive me. Come, shake hands, and let's&#xD;
pp. friends.. I shall not forget my lesson. You need not be&#xD;
afraid of me."_&#xD;
And is itsfear that ye'd be spakin' to me about?" retorted&#xD;
Sonsie, scornfully.&#xD;
J   looked smilingly at her.&#xD;
"I've madeanother misstep I-see; pray don't.extinguish a&#xD;
-poor,,innocent fellow. You said you wanted a sweetheart."&#xD;
"Nosir ! Mr. Vedder,. I said not that at all Of course, I&#xD;
shall have one some day ; but the boy that'll touch one -drop&#xD;
of that nasty stuff is not the sweetheart for me - And, oh ,Mr.&#xD;
Vedd  ! "(Sonsie's voice trembled with her earnest feeling), "I&#xD;
wish ye could promise. year soul niver, niver tor touch it no&#xD;
Igore " ,.&#xD;
Jan sprang up.&#xD;
' yve.! P'1l do it, Sousie ! I've taken my last drink, so&#xD;
he4pgnp 3[eatven ! l, 4ropped the flask into the middle, of&#xD;
girmg sggtump; from-whi-h soon a sharp crash ws heard,&#xD;
&#xD;
and a blue flame mounted in spiral tints, like Asmodeus set&#xD;
free from his bottle. " Now am I forgiven, Sonsie?"&#xD;
"'Yes, sir!"  Sonsie thrust out both her hands, which Jan&#xD;
took in his : her humid eyes glistened, and her face kindled with&#xD;
enthusiastic joy. " May the good God give ye strength to be&#xD;
rueto yer vow!"&#xD;
Jansmiled back her enthusiasm one instant, and then he&#xD;
sack doin on the log where she was still sitting ; and the hab-&#xD;
itual listless, indifferent look crept back into his face, and the&#xD;
fire faded from his eyes.&#xD;
"But what am I to do,? What is my'stupidlife good for?"&#xD;
" Augh ! for..shame, sir, to talk like that-! If you had seen&#xD;
the misery I've put me two sorrowful eyes onto, and felt jthe&#xD;
sore gWant pinching yer very life out wid the hunger-pang, and&#xD;
yer sisters and brothers shivering wid :the cold, ye couldn't&#xD;
forget how it feels, anid fold-yer hands, and roll up yer eyes, and&#xD;
say, 'What'll I do wid rme laziness?' Do! .why go -to work;&#xD;
sure ! - Put yer life into stopping the sufferin' and the Woe that's&#xD;
cryin' out everywheres for such as you.to help 'em !"&#xD;
"Very well, Sonsie," replied Jan, to whom the signs of Son-&#xD;
sie's affluent nature, and. her fervid,, impassioned ways were&#xD;
agreeable; "very well ! Tell me where to begin; I'm ready to&#xD;
learn of you. A work that'll be interesting, absorbing. I've&#xD;
had enough of the petticoats; they are a weariness to the flesh."&#xD;
"How old are"you, Mr  Vedder ?-" asked Sonsie abruptly.&#xD;
"Few and evil are the days- of. the years ofthy-servant,&#xD;
barely twenty and one 1"-'answered Jan, with, a half-amused,&#xD;
half-blas6 look into her ,earnest eyes.&#xD;
"And how much nioneyhave ya to show for all that same?"&#xD;
The young fellow:looked curiously.at ha,and wondered&#xD;
what train of thought she was following, and threw out his re-&#xD;
ply as a lure.&#xD;

"nI'n sure I cannot tell you. Cousin Vedder keeps my&#xD;
books. I suppose there might be half a million, or maybe a&#xD;
million. Not enough to buy an honest girl, as you have just&#xD;
S taught me."&#xD;
"Half a million 1" repeated Sonsie, unheeding Jan's sneer.'&#xD;
"Tens, hundreds, millions ! What a thing to be a man, and&#xD;
own money like -that ! And there sits the lazy Dutciman, wid&#xD;
his chin in his fingers, and says he's nothing in his life worth&#xD;
the havin' ! Holy saints-be praised for me, bein, but the slip&#xD;
of a wild Irish lassie, wid the heart and soul inside me to feel&#xD;
for my fellow-sufferers, and a pair of strong arms and willin'&#xD;
hands to work for em ! Whisper now, Mr. Vedder; don't be&#xD;
talkin'. I'll give. ye the sound of someswords that'll take the&#xD;
mockin' smile off yer lip's, and bring the tears to yer eyes;- if&#xD;
ye've the love of yer kind hided up in that gret body of yours;&#xD;
and 'tis thrue for you, yer should have, by the look of ye; so&#xD;
honest and merry. They all say ye's a good chap, as is no-&#xD;
body's enemy but his own."&#xD;
Jan was not over pleased with this estimate of him so care-&#xD;
lessly given, and was-about to throw back a jeering speech in&#xD;
payment, when Sonsie placed her hand on his arm.&#xD;
"EListen, sir," said she, and began reciting,&#xD;
"Her garments were thin, and ragged, and scanty."&#xD;
Jan remained quiet, looking at her- in a lofty, half-amused&#xD;
way; studying the expression of her face.; thinking what an odd&#xD;
bright, fearless. creature she was ; running hist eyes over her&#xD;
crisp curls and crimson cheeks, and following the play of her&#xD;
red hps, and the glistening of her little white teeth, in the poetr&#xD;
which -she rendergd with impassioned ?ane  and rich Irish&#xD;
acce t. - Whenshe put .herhand onthis arr, helooked at.its&#xD;
round, supple fingers, and had half a mind to place his pwn&#xD;
&#xD;
above them; but somehow he couldn't quite do it ; though she&#xD;
was a servant in shabby clothing, and he a gentleman in fine&#xD;
raiment. She had hot gone many lines, when he began to at-&#xD;
tend, and soon became absorbed ; and when she came to the&#xD;
part, -&#xD;
"Yes, ask dear christ to comfort them, and fold them in his Told,"&#xD;
he found it convenient to drop his eyes into his.soft hat, and&#xD;
sat quite motionless till she had finished, and a moment after.&#xD;
Then he stole a look at the fervid speaker, whose hands were&#xD;
clasped, and down whose hot, crimson cheeks great tears were&#xD;
dropping ; and Mr.~Jan twisted his head over his shoulder, and&#xD;
pretended to be busy with brushing the moss and tree-soil from&#xD;
his hinting coat ; but his voice trembled through his assumed&#xD;
carelessness when he spoke.&#xD;
"You have got a fortune in your voice, Sonsie. What a&#xD;
Fanchon- you'd make ! You ought to study for the stage!&#xD;
Pray, where did you pick up that moving little poem? 2-touch--&#xD;
ing, positively!"&#xD;
"I had itfrom my white angel,who will fold her wings close&#xD;
to the Holy Mother in the Palace of the Great King."  Then,&#xD;
with one of the -sudden transitions of which the volatile Mile-&#xD;
sians are so capable, she added, smiling ,queerly,. and showing&#xD;
her white teeth, as she threw-an odd merry look at her neigh-&#xD;
bor, "And there'll be niver the sign of a lazy Dutchmanabout&#xD;
the plate, at-allat-all.&#xD;
Then she wiped her eyes onthe- corner of her apron. "Why&#xD;
don't you be a cooperativ, Mr. - Vedder-; or have a home for&#xD;
the friendless and the orphans?°- There's Teddy and the baby '11&#xD;
start the business for ye; and a likely pair they are  And Pil&#xD;

' learning pinchin' and savin' wid the ould dragon for something&#xD;
I hope."&#xD;
" What's a cooperative, Sonsie ?" asked Jan, not at all im-&#xD;
pressed by the idea. " I don't care a pin about the Gonecussets&#xD;
or their operatives: you must fix on something more taking than&#xD;
that, if you wish to enlist my-sympathies. I say, Sonsie, you are&#xD;
a good child; smart, bright, quick-witted, and nice-looking."&#xD;
He looked fixedly at her. "I'll do something for you, if you wil&#xD;
let -me. Now tell me, what do you:desire most in all the world ?"&#xD;
"Idication," replied Sonsie, concisely.&#xD;
"Ohs very good,.my dear; you, possess the soul of wit, in&#xD;
your communications, which are of the "yea, yea" order, and,&#xD;
idication, you shall, have- all you can. take in. I'll put you in&#xD;
school to-morrow, and you shall stay as long as you like. The&#xD;
nore you learn, the better I shall be suited."&#xD;
"Tst-tst-! tst !"  Sousie made the peculiar call with which&#xD;
the old Irish wives are wont to entice their pigs. "Indade an'ye&#xD;
will, sir? and what for will ye do that same? " She fastened her&#xD;
blue eyes upon his half-averted face in a penetrating gaze.&#xD;
y   you aggravating, suspicous young vixen," answered&#xD;
J4a(stooping down topick up a couple of pebbles which he&#xD;
waskicking about under his boot,and which, when he had got&#xD;
them in his palm, had no beauty to render them desirable), "for&#xD;
.the luxury of doing good, of course : haven't you been 'preach-&#xD;
ing it up to me? Y ou will. do as a specimen to practise upon&#xD;
as well as another, I suppose; and I am quite fired with im-&#xD;
patience to begin. I feel a. glow of all sort s of emotions kind-&#xD;
ling in my soul; I'm reformed! I'm a hero. There's th bottle-&#xD;
inip consigned to his native element to witness for me. It'&#xD;
seems to me possible, that, with careful culture of thegerm of&#xD;
go    which is springing in ny heart, I nay even rise to a&#xD;
pitch of virtue worth the acceptance of the dashing young&#xD;
&#xD;
emerald who is tilting up her precious nose, in such amiable&#xD;
scorn."&#xD;
Before Jan had finished the speech, curiously compounded,&#xD;
from his mannish dislike .to be brought to book,. squirming un-&#xD;
der Sonsie' s contempt for his idle, purposeless life, his adniira-&#xD;
tion of her fresh face, and an underthought, which caused him&#xD;
to drop his eyes beneath her clear-seeing gaze, which was read-&#xD;
ing him like an open book, --he was sorry he had spoken at&#xD;
all.&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Jan Vedder.. No," said Sonsie, after sitting&#xD;
silent long enough to make the pause very unpleasant to.kthe&#xD;
young fellow, "I'll go to Mistress Blair, and be "her servant ;&#xD;
I'll wash her dishes, and scrub her floors, and learn all she' will&#xD;
be heavenly kind enough to teach me. If you had made me the&#xD;
good offer, as a true man that has money to lend, might have&#xD;
made it to a poor girl, 'I'd have-taken up wid it, and blessed&#xD;
ye on me knees. I know quite well, sir, what it is. I've to do;&#xD;
I don't need you nor any persow'else tg  tell' me what I am. I've&#xD;

her faded old garments had disappeared from his sight.&#xD;
As the setting sun ceased to temper the chilly, wind, he rose&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
OLD FRIENDS WITH NEW FACES.&#xD;
ND this is uncle Alec's Mexican abiding-place;' and&#xD;
there is the glorious old fellow, seated on the wide&#xD;
veranda, in the{ airiest of ,ostumes; nothing super-&#xD;
fous about him; no coat, nor vest, over his plaid linen shirt,&#xD;
which is of the finest, and fresh from the laundry of old Chapeta.&#xD;
His iron-gray hair is still moist and curly from his morning bath,&#xD;
and his ruddy cheeks shine with the polishing they got under the&#xD;
cool shower; hislong:silky beard flows down over the delicate&#xD;
Frills he has always wotn upon his;bosomsii ce his early man-&#xD;
hood. His father wore the like before him, and also his grand-&#xD;
father, and 'his father, the Scottish gentleman whoed up at&#xD;
Craigenfels, and was buried beneath a tablet on: the- hillside&#xD;
&#xD;
OLD FRIENDS WITH NEW FACES.&#xD;
&#xD;
close behind the little gothic church; and among the tale of&#xD;
his virtues was the statement that he was "a good and loyal&#xD;
subject to King George."&#xD;
No cramping necktie confines uncle Alec's throat, but' his&#xD;
roomy collar turns away from his pillar of a neck, and the dia-&#xD;
mond-stud which fastens it glistens rarely. Its-fellows hold his&#xD;
snowy wristbands; and the handkerchief across the knees of his&#xD;
linen pants is fine and white; 4is silk braces are 'broidered with&#xD;
marvellous needle-work, and buckled with golden buckles; and&#xD;
slippers of scarlet velvet, rich with silken flowers, incase his&#xD;
feet ; and altogether the genial old fellow looks a very cool,&#xD;
comfortable specimen of a Mexican planter taking his ease-&#xD;
at peace with himself and the whole world.&#xD;
One shapely white hand caresses the head of a young tiger-&#xD;
cat, who crouches at his side, and whose yellow eyes, blink&#xD;
sleepily tinder the pleasant touch, though he=never forgets that&#xD;
one of his great'powerful paws lies across the wide brim of his&#xD;
master's palmetto, of which he considers himself in charge,&#xD;
Spotty has something of his own to watch, too; for:awDiogenes&#xD;
Hermit crab (which he encountered in his morning ramble,&#xD;
climbing a tree,with a great turbo-shell on his back, as uucon&#xD;
cerned as though it had been a.feather-weight}lies 'on the rael&#xD;
walk. HunterSpottybrought him home despite his horrible&#xD;
odor and his 'noisy croaking. The great claw which 'Hermit&#xD;
keeps over the entrance-Hfhit shell, like a dor, doesn't cheat&#xD;
cunning Spotty: he sees it lift a trifle occasionaly, and sees&#xD;
also the projectingfoo stalk in which our crab wearsfhis-sharp&#xD;
eyes like a black bead; and then he growls, forhe knows that&#xD;
his prize meditates getting safe off-presently.&#xD;
A gentle-eyed tapir also is an object of Spotty's surveillance,&#xD;
who comes smelling along, with her head down feeling abut&#xD;

about four feet high, you feel at a loss whether to consider&#xD;
her a very large hog or a very small elephant, and finally settle&#xD;
down to the conviction that she is a connecting link between&#xD;
the two. She is. a very loving.mother to that pretty young One&#xD;
of hers, so beautifully marked with yellowish tan-colored stripes,&#xD;
and diamonds upon its brown-black hide ; and her kind master,&#xD;
with whom she is accustomed to take all sorts of liberties,--&#xD;
sticking her trunk into his pocket and abstracting the pistachis&#xD;
nuts;passing it over his haids and face, conversing occasionally&#xD;
in-'her curious shrill whistle, -is very fond her.&#xD;
Spotty has; often tried his teeth upon Tapir's thick skin, and&#xD;
once he fastened himself on to her back, intending to make a&#xD;
finish of her; but she erected; her stiff mane, and giving voice&#xD;
at intervals, like an engine, she set off, carrying her nose close&#xD;
to theaground, through the thick brush, hoping to sweep away her&#xD;
unwelcome rider. -Not succeeding, she made for the lake, and&#xD;
plunged in.: She, Madame Tapir, is mistress. of two elements.&#xD;
Hunter Spotty has breathing apparatus for but one, and he is&#xD;
glad to leave-go, and swim 'for his dear life. Twenty feet deep&#xD;
of cold water is too deep for him; but though he looked smooth&#xD;
and glossy after his enforced. bath, he does not like -Madame,&#xD;
nor her pretty young one .either, and he shows his teeth, and&#xD;
snarls gat.them both.                          A'&#xD;
An armadillo (Bolita, little ball) lies in the, corner of the&#xD;
wide averanda,- with its head and: feet drawn into its arrgor, as&#xD;
the easiest mode of getting rid of two troublesome scarlet and&#xD;
green parrots, who, while scolding and nipping each other, are&#xD;
making common cause against the mailed ball on which they&#xD;
stand,. knocking and rapping the polished plates, with as -much&#xD;
effect as,.though they had been solid steel. And all he deni-&#xD;

marinonda, who, seated on a perch out of reach, with its prem&#xD;
hensile tail, limb-like, turned around'a rod above itshead, is,&#xD;
watching their motions with the sober, speculative curiosity,&#xD;
which is peculiar to those gentle little creatures, so affectionate&#xD;
and teachable, and so airily fantastic in their gambols with their&#xD;
human associates.&#xD;
Uncle Alec glances from time to time at a friend who-occu.&#xD;
pies a bamboo-chair, on his right, who sits, chin in hand, and&#xD;
eyes looking straight over the cerros into the tree-tops, tossed&#xD;
by a breeze which has- a few light clouds under convoy, and&#xD;
hurries them helter-skelter across the heavens; but which comes&#xD;
not near to the humanity below, sighing and panting for a&#xD;
breath of it.' This reticentfriend, who says nothing about him'&#xD;
self or his family, is a care and a puzzle to kind Uncle Alec,&#xD;
who would gladly make all the world happy, and who is acus,&#xD;
toned to lavish money and kindness with handful heartiness;&#xD;
but he cannot fathomthis melancholy, or understand this -silent&#xD;
grief, to which no willing voice is ever given He is a great&#xD;
bronzed giant of a fellow, this friend; with crisp carl, massive&#xD;
head, anda' determined; powerful face;"strong to do; and also-to&#xD;
endure; but whose repose and strength is half negatived by sor&#xD;
rowful eyes, which gaze out with sad wistfulness and unrea,and&#xD;
whose firm red lips, shadowed -bytheir silky mustache, a'e too&#xD;
closely pressed together to show the strong white teethhis nietry&#xD;
smiles used to reveal. His' deep thest heaves occasionally&#xD;
with unconscinus sighs, and his fingers beat out the-fragmetit. of&#xD;

young mother and her baby, sitting before a cheerful wood-fire&#xD;
in the gloaming ; sitting there and waiting, and his fingers beat&#xD;
outthe tune upon the braided arm of his bamboo-chair, while&#xD;
his thoughts are busy. among his memories.&#xD;
He isa tremendous worker, is the giant,-tireless, unflinching,&#xD;
unsparing of his muscle; nearest to content when his plastic&#xD;
fingers are busy among levers and wheels, and the delicate&#xD;
machines which he delights so curiously to fashion. Many&#xD;
child's toys are cunningly wrought by this silent man, and he&#xD;
hoards them with careful, almost tender devotion, and goes often&#xD;
to repolish and retouch them, and is fond of carving a ,name&#xD;
upon them,-- "Pigeon." I;t is always the same, but is diversely&#xD;
wrought,-in Old English, in German Text, and delicately em-&#xD;
blazoned with colored capitals. He read in a stray newspaper&#xD;
,of a man who made an engine from,:a silver half-dollar, and he&#xD;
got to work directly ; -and it afforded him many quiet hours of&#xD;
engrossing toil; complete and delicate in every part, from the tiny&#xD;
boier, which held about eight drops of water, to the two minute&#xD;
guages; and when he had kept it running five minutes on its&#xD;
supply, he put itsafely aside under the same mark he gave his&#xD;
toys,-"Pigeon." Once he began.a "Ruth," upon a work-box&#xD;
of campeachy wood, but before it was finished,;he rushed out&#xD;
tothe mines and set his- strengthtodig with the Peandres,&#xD;
til dead night; and whenthe returned, he covered the "R" and&#xD;
the box out of his pained sight and hid it away.&#xD;
He has.not been many months at San  histabel; but the&#xD;
miners both fear and love him; they obey his lightest word.&#xD;
Sagacious, practical Uncle Alec has an active coadjutor in&#xD;
all his schemes, which tle g ai"t grasps i full extent.and minute&#xD;
detail, elaborating and working them out successfully&#xD;
= Now that we meet Uncle Alec in his Mexican home, it is&#xD;
easier-to omprehen dthe charm which keeps lim an exile from&#xD;

his native land. EveitrCraigenfels can scarcely compare with San&#xD;
Christabel for beauty. The Quinta is queen of a wide ravine,&#xD;
almost a valley, backed by abrupt and lofty mottntains which&#xD;
were seared and torn with deep lbarrancas abouiding with fear-&#xD;
ful precipices, terrible chasms, which nature kindly veiled tnder&#xD;
a drapery of trailing vines and ever-greenery, and which are&#xD;
the favorite home of beautiful dun-colored squirrels, hares, and&#xD;
divers singing-birds, as well as tiger-cats and monkeys. Stretch-&#xD;
ing away, in view of the broad veranda, rise the cerros, which&#xD;
are cut into a series of terraces, each with-a gravelled walk lead-&#xD;
ing high and higher to the wooded top of the last acclivity, from&#xD;
which the view is simply entrancing, far beyond civilization&#xD;
past cocoa-nut groves and palmclusters, and the'sidewise sweep&#xD;
of the glittering river.&#xD;
The red gravel drive-way-kept scrupulously- free from the&#xD;
the encroaching Bermuda grass -winds through the ground,&#xD;
skirts the piazza, and defines a gorgeous garden full of tropical&#xD;
beauties, and encircles also the sierraa de /os duendes, as Uncle&#xD;
Alec is fond of calling the great enclosure where nature has been&#xD;
scarcely assisted in this terra calicientie in arranging her chanr&#xD;

which droop their pendent blossoms - above the ring and&#xD;
subdued Arroyato, which lingers a little, to sing its song beneath&#xD;
them, on its merry journey of tireless play to the sounding sea.&#xD;
Within the light cane-fence of theiower garden bloom the fne&#xD;

A Spanish maccaw has retired to the azotea for practice of a new&#xD;

It is seven o'clock. Uncle Alec has been in the saddle three&#xD;
hours or more, riding over his cafetele; and he has just told his&#xD;
friend (who came from the reality where Jason the overseer is&#xD;
"pitting through" a new gallery, most exultingly) that he has&#xD;
fifteen trees in full berry, which must yield him twenty pounds&#xD;
each.&#xD;

her petticoat embroidered with a band of -scarlet fern-leaves at&#xD;

neck and arms bare. Her hair is put off her face and fastened&#xD;
in a broad thick plait at the back, which reaches far below, her&#xD;
knee, and finished with silver bells. A great comb of filagree.&#xD;
work crowns her head, from which she has removed the reboza,&#xD;
or scarf, which it keeps in place when she goes abroad. Then&#xD;
Zitella throws one end of her national head-gear over her shoul-&#xD;
der, and the scarlet fringe falls gracefully to her waist ; her slender&#xD;
legs are bare ; so are her feet ; and her bronze ankles are round&#xD;
and firm enough for a model, and every toe is perfect. She is a&#xD;
favorite servant and she wears armlets of virgin silver, and a neck-&#xD;
lace of great Mexican pearls. Uncle Alec-bought them of a&#xD;
lepero, whom he encountered one evening rather unexpect-&#xD;
edly, stretched at full length under the aloe hedge. He said he&#xD;
was waiting to shoot some of the Spanish vultures whidi were&#xD;
roosting in long lines on the trees, black, grave, and silent.,He&#xD;
pointed them out with his brown finger half a mile away, and&#xD;
then he produced the pearls from his bosom. No sooner did&#xD;
he receive his money (a couple of 'Spanish dollars), than he set&#xD;
off to join his friends; and in another hour the "dusky palque "&#xD;
was master of them all.&#xD;
Zitella is a pious girl, and tells faithfully the beads of the&#xD;

her toilet complete without them, and her best friend and pro4&#xD;

the castahets with her'pretty:brown fingers. The old yellow-&#xD;

sing her wild Indian songs,' arid he has a dim intention of send-&#xD;
ing her to Roaring River to be taught, but lazily postpones it.&#xD;
She heard something of such a plan once, which she only&#xD;
understood as a threat of exile from her dear home, and she re-&#xD;
doubled her efforts to please and serve. She simply adores Seior&#xD;
Aleka, .and she has good cause : she made acquaintance with&#xD;

should he ever leave San Christabelj he would do, wisely to&#xD;
marry the little maid to some honest fellow, or' she might fare&#xD;
hardly. "A favorite has no lovers."&#xD;
A caracdlla 'approaches along the winding drive, and Uncle&#xD;
"Alec leaves his frolic with the young tapir and pushes off the&#xD;

brigand might have done, who wooed the Spanish maid, Zitella,&#xD;
beneath the round-orbed moon in old Castile.&#xD;
"George Blair !" exclaimed Uncle Alec. "We have a visi-&#xD;
tor from home!"&#xD;
Both gentlemen started to their feet, but with widely&#xD;
differing welcomes in face and attitude, as ..the traveller&#xD;
descended from his caratella, with weary gesture, like one&#xD;
fatigued with tiresome journeying.&#xD;
"Ye gods and little fishes !" Uncle Alec spread his hands in&#xD;
fantastic astonishment. Unless he be dead, and has arrived at&#xD;
the dignity of a ghost, this should- be my nephew Otho. Why&#xD;
you come upon us like a shooting star! You drop down upon&#xD;
my very door-step, as. easily as my neighbor San Juan, who&#xD;
breakfasts with me three mornings out of the seven; and yet you&#xD;
shrild smell of the salt ocean ; you are fresh from the yeasty&#xD;
waves, the cradling billows, have been wooed by "westlin&#xD;
winds."  Whew! my dear boy, don't you know it is dangerous&#xD;
to astonish a fat elderly gentleman to such an extent ? Make&#xD;
haste slowly, is the only wear with the thermoneter at ninety&#xD;
in the shade."&#xD;
Uncle Alec was entirely oblivious to the fact that his hasty&#xD;
rising had overset his cane-seat upQn Spotty, who withdrew&#xD;
snarling and sneezing; and began to pace up and down, with&#xD;
his head. on one side, licking his lips, occasionally, as he eyed&#xD;
the humans ; but at this point a scuffle and rush, and a piteous&#xD;
cry,-caused the host to turn around., Somehow Spotty had run&#xD;
against the little tapir ; and I suppose he nipped him, because&#xD;
every hair on his mother stood on end, and her tail was wiggling,&#xD;
about and her teeth were champing; and the maccaw shouted&#xD;
out provoking laughter,v.when the marimonda dropped upon&#xD;
Spotty'.s back' from his sightly perch, and he turned tail.and&#xD;
ran away. Not that Mr. Maccaw knew any thing of what was&#xD;
&#xD;
going on, only he heard a yelping and scufflef06m his sightly-&#xD;
perch; and he always, upon principle, helped out any hubbub.&#xD;
" Otho, my dear fellow, welcome to San Christabel .!" said&#xD;
Uncle Alec, after laughing at the fracas. Come, hasten and give&#xD;
us news of little pet. How I should love to see her. pretty&#xD;
face among my flowers ! and, by Jupiter, she'd name every indi-&#xD;
vidual of them for you, without a Flora. Why didn't you bring&#xD;
her along ?-two years not up, hey? and Sir Masterful will&#xD;
not 'bate one jot of his determination. I've .a great mind to send&#xD;
you back for her : give you a good Mexican breakfast, though,&#xD;
first. Here, you Hilario,.you've -stood on one leg long enough;&#xD;
never mind. making any more eyes" at Zitella just now; lift out&#xD;
that valise. American baggage ,is it, nephew?  Inside there,&#xD;
Juan - tenth room. Rosillo, look after this gentleman: cool&#xD;
water, a lime, a bath, and then breakfast."&#xD;
While running on thus, in a hearty voice, and with ruch&#xD;
Yankee hand -shaking, Uncle Alec had been all the while-&#xD;
studying his guest and wondering what trouble had driven him&#xD;
from home. It must be trouble; for his proud, grave face was&#xD;
unlighted by any smile, even while he answered his host's cor-&#xD;
dial welcome in courteous phrase.&#xD;
Still holding the young gentleman's hand, he turned sud-&#xD;
denly.&#xD;
"George Blair, have you forgotten Otho.Groenveldt?"&#xD;
"I assure you no! Mr. Craigenfels," answered George, bow-&#xD;
ing slightly; and his bitter tone said, " I have too good cause to&#xD;
remember him."&#xD;
Otho bowed in return: he could do no less; but the whole&#xD;
story which his Roaring River friends had told him, -how this&#xD;
man had deserted his wife (and the best and sweetest wife in&#xD;
the world too) for no cause, and left her with her boy, shut up&#xD;

In the instant that the two men stood facing each other,&#xD;
Otho weighed the young blacksmith in his ;mental balance, and&#xD;
set hirn down a selfish rascal, who had cut loose from his forge,&#xD;
and 'his duties, that he might seek a fortune out here in the&#xD;

had stood back, with clenched hands and thick-coming breath,&#xD;
turned on his heel and marched off. A blow is the natural&#xD;
sequence of such a look and such 'an attitude as his, but&#xD;
though his muscles worked fearfully and his veins filled, while&#xD;
he looked Otho in the eye, he held himself quietly. There was&#xD;
trouble and anger and bitterness and terrible suffering on his&#xD;
massive face; but. no self-despising, no shame : he saddled his&#xD;
high stepping brascador, and started full passo for bocca Mina.&#xD;

&#xD;
had loitered a. long while among; and brought, one by one,&#xD;
the savory dishes,- for Mexicans never crowd or mix their good&#xD;
things,- emparanda of dried fish, highly seasoned with chile, and&#xD;
mixed with pounded shrimps and oil, and baked between two&#xD;
thin corn-cakes;- ducks stuffed with mushrooms; frigoles; hare,&#xD;
stewed in wine; broiled quails; and, through all, the usual ad.&#xD;
mixture of onions, oil, and capsicums, and the inevitable&#xD;
tortillos, hot with chile, which she fetched in a snowy napkin,&#xD;
and laid-beside each plate, carefully serving Sefior Aleka first.&#xD;
Then came chocolate prepared in the curious little lignuii-vitoe&#xD;
mills, without which no rancho is complete. The frothy beverage&#xD;
thus concocted has a flavor which a stay-at-home cannot even&#xD;
dream of.&#xD;
Uncle Alec watched his guest, in secret amusement atthe In.-&#xD;
dian;stoicism with which he got through a peppery meal, which&#xD;
needed long habit to.endure, much more enjoy.&#xD;
"You.will do to live in Mexico, my boy ! you take to pep-&#xD;
.per as naturally as .a duck takesto water."&#xD;
fullyy intend to live here, sir," replied Otho, without lifting&#xD;
his eyes from his plate.&#xD;
nAcle Alec studied him, and a shade of displeasure crossed&#xD;
his; ,genial face; something in the tone as well as the matter&#xD;
.of the reply fretted and chafed him, and he £elt "like speaking&#xD;
up;" ,but dear old Alec Craigenfels had "suffered and got&#xD;
strong" years ago, and learned a large tolerance. He took up&#xD;
a silver-boundgoblet. of golden crystal at his elbow and began&#xD;
praising the palque it contained, ascribing to it as many good&#xD;
qualities as the " Bonnie Scots",do to whiskey.&#xD;
4It-i's a stomachic, my boy, -a great promoter of digestion ,&#xD;
and good sleep, -a sovereign cure for trouble. Strangers tell&#xD;
us it smells like sour milk, tainted meat, and such like. Perhaps&#xD;
it may, to uneducated nostrils; but we lyexicans know that it is&#xD;
&#xD;
a wholesome and refreshing beverage." And then he launched&#xD;
out into a long description of the process of manufacture, and&#xD;
of the aloe, Agave Americanus; how theIndians know the&#xD;
precise moment of cutting the flower-stalk- to secure the-sap&#xD;
distilled by the, plant for the coming bloom, and -the leathern&#xD;
bottas in which it is fermented; and if Otho knew that this&#xD;
uncle was talking to keep off the relation of difficulties ,he&#xD;
dreaded, and which-he felt was coming, he did not show. it; but&#xD;
he questioned and replied with ready and grave attention.&#xD;
"I must take you out to my Maguy plantation : the yellow&#xD;
and white spinose teethed narcissi which Thomas cherishes up&#xD;
at Craigenfels are babies to these fellows with their leaves eight&#xD;
feet long. I've a thousand in my field, and a hundred.of them&#xD;
bloom every year. Why you see the great scooped out 'cup&#xD;
which. receives our 'honey-water' is two feet 'deep. That-is&#xD;
the name we give the pure sap before we ferment it.it is&#xD;
scentless,,and thin and clear, and we take a. portion of jt for&#xD;
our ' master palque,' or mother of palque, as the Indians call&#xD;
it. They make a yeast from it to ferment the rest; and in four&#xD;
and twenty hours after: setting it is in its most=perfect state} for&#xD;
drinking.&#xD;
"Here, Zitella, bring us a fresh botta. Now. this. was made&#xD;
yesterday, and you perceive that:it is very delicate and pleasant.&#xD;
Many planters make what we call -Mxia  a coarse brandy&#xD;
from our aloe. But I an! content with my palque. The sold&#xD;
Aztecs pound their paper from its leaves, and the' Indians&#xD;
now.pulltita or twinefrom its fibres. So you',see my boy our&#xD;
agace is a useful ,servant,; and it is only one among many which&#xD;
belong to us. Mother Nature is very goodto her 'children of&#xD;
the sun.' Well, after your first trial, what can' you say,. for&#xD;
palque ?"&#xD;

"I think-a taste might be acquired for it. It is said that the&#xD;
Chinese are fond of assafoetida as a perfume."&#xD;
Uncle Alec'laughed. "'Rather hard Qn our native liquor, but&#xD;
you'll find you: prefer it to wines, or., even your dear American&#xD;
mixeddrinks, which are enough to kill a'horse. Howel's saying&#xD;
of sacks and canaries, applies richly to your chamipagn cocktails,&#xD;
brandy smashes, and such like. They are deemed fit only for&#xD;
t '  -those who carry their legs:in their heads, their eyes upon their&#xD;
noses, and an almanac in their bones."&#xD;
"rGraphic and original, at any rate," replied Otho. "But the&#xD;
American drinks are 'all strangers to me. I have no fancy&#xD;
for poisoning my blood and burning up my brain, with any such&#xD;
vile abominations Light German wines are all very well in&#xD;
Germany, but even 'these are out-place, and not needed in our*&#xD;
nothern climate, where the air is as invigorating as chai-&#xD;
pagne.".&#xD;
:Quiteright; my boy; but still, our palque is a friend to man-&#xD;
kind, a corffrter in sorrow."&#xD;
Otho availed .himself of the first pause in the talk to say&#xD;
proudly, like, one needing 'human help:and sympathy, and yet&#xD;
despising it, "Uncle Alec, I have. come to you for work ; give&#xD;
me something to do; the more difficult and absorbing the better.&#xD;
Do notask me any questionsbut put me into something that&#xD;
will keep my head and hands busy, and let me settle Mexican&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
Mr. Craigenfels made no reply but sat looking across at the&#xD;
youngman' in a troubled, anxious way, and his thoughts travelled&#xD;
away tQ Roaring River and busied themselves about a young&#xD;
girl,:named Christabel Goldsmith,-who was the child of Fred the&#xD;
artist, his, boyhood's friend, and who he knew was betrothed to&#xD;
this man.&#xD;
"Poor little pet!" he thought. "I as good as knew that he'd&#xD;

make her suffer, he's 'such a masterful 'chap. It would be as&#xD;
much as my life is worth, I suppose, to inquire into his affairs.&#xD;
Sitting there so proud and provoking I I shall have,'to do my&#xD;
best in the dark. They've quarreled, 'of course: that is the up-&#xD;
shot of it ; and her sweet life is as good as spoiled.- 0 Lord!"&#xD;
"Well, it is odd, Otho," he began aloud; "'very odd-; bht do&#xD;
you know George Blair came to me in the same 'way, -=-asking&#xD;
for work'; said he had left his.life behind him'; didn't want any&#xD;
questions asked, but must begin anew. 'Have you 'had any&#xD;
quarrel with George, Otho ?"&#xD;
" No, sir," replied Otho, loftily.&#xD;
" Ah, well ! he's a wrecked boat, I'm afiaid ; cut adrift from&#xD;
safe mooring ; broken up almost; he is always brooding over&#xD;
something. But I believe he is a true man, after all. I wish I&#xD;
could help' him out of his trouble. Have you any idea what&#xD;
sent him out here ?"&#xD;
" Not the least, sir : it is his own secret," answered Otho,&#xD;
coldly. "I have no wish to discuss Mr. Blair's affair i: my own&#xD;
life is' all I can manage."&#xD;
"We don't manage our lives, my boy'" replied Uncle Alec,&#xD;
seriously and simply; "and happy are we, when we learn'tofeel&#xD;
the Hand which leads us. I aiii very glad to have yoUnith me.&#xD;
I would have proposed it to you; 'if I 'had -supposed you free to&#xD;

States- forever; and I will .enter heart and soul intt your&#xD;

"cWell, well, my boy, that's all very well ; and it is in the dim&#xD;
future. We wont pin ourselves down to any sudden resolve.&#xD;
I have plenty. of irons in the fire, all red-hot; and you shall&#xD;
choose which to take a clip at first. There's my cafetele, I've&#xD;
been-over it this-morning; trees full of berries and as plump&#xD;
and green as peas, and the little ingenio, sugar grove, you know.&#xD;
Before I. fixed my trepiche, I surveyed the ground carefully,&#xD;
and I count it about the neatest thing I've got. My gang&#xD;
of fifty hands can make ten - thousand arrobas of sugar as&#xD;
easy as turn the fistover, and they will do it too. Then there's&#xD;
my indigo lot - that's just the prettiest little trabajo / 'Ifill your&#xD;
pocket with Spanish dollars. The Aztecs thought no small&#xD;
beer of it, to judge from the' name they blessed it with, -'Xiuh-&#xD;

water over the pebbles. I mustn't forget to introduce you toy&#xD;
my red-flowered night beauty; the Yankees keep'it in bottles,&#xD;
and they give it to little boys."&#xD;
Uncle. Alec spread his'hands over his ample stomach, and&#xD;
made a series of puckered-faces.. "Jalap, Otho ! .So I knew&#xD;
you'd remember your early acquaintance with my 'Belle de&#xD;
Zuit.' It is a lovely creature.- to look at. I must send some&#xD;
plants to Thomas. There's a pile of money in any of these, my&#xD;
boy; I've only amused myself. among them as Mexican toys, but&#xD;
I haven't lost a dime,though ; oh, no, 'I make my little sports&#xD;
pay.. This is .a great country, sir ! we ought to annex it; that's&#xD;
gospel truth. Why wax alone would be . fortune (I've a jolly&#xD;
lot of bees down at my hacienda); and there's cochineal, and&#xD;
tabasco peppers, and aguavas, and olives, and pistacho-nuts,&#xD;
ibesides all. the fruits .I've placed before you this morning.&#xD;

&#xD;
Think of the woods ! -campeachy, mahogany, and a thousand&#xD;
others, all beautiful. 0 Lord !"&#xD;
Uncle Alec wiped his face, which was hot with excitement&#xD;
over his favorite topic.&#xD;
"What ever brought you Otho?" (flourishing his, handker-&#xD;
chief, and looking very kindly in his nephew's face). "I'm sure&#xD;
it was nothing mean or unworthy; and whatever it was,i'm&#xD;
glad to have you with me. I love you, my boy ; and I must&#xD;
begin with you directly. We'll commence this very day to look&#xD;
over the different works, and post. you thoroughly."&#xD;
Otho was checked in his reply by the sound of a zittern be-&#xD;
neath the great open window, and a rich voice singing,-&#xD;
" Gentle Zitella, whither away?&#xD;
Love's ritornella,list while I play."&#xD;
Glancing out, they saw Hilario seated on the ground, and&#xD;
the young Indian maid standing a little way off, well pleased&#xD;
with the song and the singer.&#xD;
"Nay, nay, child,, mind thyroses ! Never look so shyly&#xD;
bright; even though his hair is jetty andhis face handsome,&#xD;
never heed his soft Spanish words. I misdoubt me, this Hi.&#xD;
lario is too full of whims and. hot tempers to be a wise guardian&#xD;
of thy innocence. San Christabel is a safe shelter for. thee.;&#xD;
even though the yellow-skinned Chapeta be .cross and fierce,&#xD;
and would be cruel if she dared."&#xD;
While kind Uncle Alec was listening to the voice and looking&#xD;
thoughtfully at Zitella, tramping hoofs came hurrying on ; and the&#xD;
young fellow, the ridgr, would have hunted down the singer who,&#xD;
touched so gaily the zittern-strings, and whose eyes drank in&#xD;
the young. listener's beauty, had he not sprang nimbly aside ;&#xD;
and a flush of wrath deepened his dusky red as he did so, and&#xD;
his ready hand sought his cutlass. Reining up his horse before&#xD;

Zitella, the rider said something to her, with an unpleasant&#xD;
laugh, which caused her to shrink away from him. Uncle Alec&#xD;
frowned and~ looked ill pleased, though he gave the stranger&#xD;
courteous greeting. He was a striping; tall, slender, with muddy,&#xD;
impure complexion'long, straight hair, and pale-blue eyes. He&#xD;
and his fatheit, DonJuan, were guests- at the neighboring&#xD;
racienda, and though frequent visitors at Sau Christabel,"were no&#xD;
favorites with its genial owne. Their ship, moored down the bay,-&#xD;
waited for theit going ; and its queer crew' swore' deep oaths in&#xD;
strange tongues at the prolonged delay. -This eighteen-'year-old&#xD;
boy took':a wilckedpleasure in pursuing Zitella, and the:prefer-&#xD;
ence sbe showed for Hilario gave zest 'to his amusement. 'As&#xD;
he was come for the day, Uncle Alec asked him to join him and&#xD;
Otho in their ride to the mine, simply because he could not&#xD;
safely leave him behind.S&#xD;
Meanwhile -Georgel1afr had reached the boca mina and&#xD;

to their ears, and the call of the' adminstrador was like the&#xD;
summons " Come forth to thy death, Victor Galbraith!"&#xD;
" Here ! you barretero ! give me your hat."  George seized&#xD;
the felt helmet from the head of a 'stolid miner; who stood&#xD;
slouching and stubborn, staring down the shaft. The lighted&#xD;
candle flared'yellow in the daylight, and the cabdlos started&#xD;
tramping on their course. George felt a grim pleasure in tempt-&#xD;
ing the danger below him, and sprang to it bg dly.&#xD;
"Senor !" exclaimed the administrador, grasping the giant's&#xD;
shoulder, "there's death, maybe, at the end of that rope.!"&#xD;
"Stand back all of you ! " shouted George, 'shaking him off.&#xD;
" There's a man's duty there, at any rate, which is muchnore&#xD;
to the purpose !"&#xD;
In the breathless silence which' followed, he descended&#xD;
slowly, and the yellow flame flared red and redder, as it disap-&#xD;
peared ; and the fearful hush was only broken by the creak of&#xD;
the cylinder, as the cord slowly unwound. Oozing water and&#xD;
loosening earth showed -to him by seconds, out of the black&#xD;
darkness; and slimy reptiles looked forth from their crevices;&#xD;
hairy spiders darted out and glared - on him with their eight&#xD;
thousand eyes ; a shining black' scorpion made a jump for the&#xD;
basket as it swung past his lair, and, missing his 'expected prey,&#xD;
he fixed his deadly fangs into a harmless golden lizard- which&#xD;
was watching the light on a tiny shelf of rock, and the bright&#xD;
little eyes saw nothing more. George understood well the&#xD;
certain death he had escaped, and he fixed his thoughts on the&#xD;
danger he was seeking, :dashing aside with resolute 'will, the&#xD;
image of Otho Groenveldt, which kept inti-uding itself; banishing&#xD;
also, with a heart-sick sob, the pretty face of sweet Rnthie in' the&#xD;
Horseshoe. If the matches were'fired -then his minutewere&#xD;

&#xD;
and ran warily and swiftly in quest of the pegador, shouting&#xD;
and whistling as he advanced. In a boveda or vaulted chain.&#xD;
ber he stopped short-the mangled head of the poor wretch&#xD;
was almost beneath his foot, the matches close grasped in his&#xD;
clenched hand; and leaping;across the still body, he pursued his&#xD;
search. He came upon the trains in the new gallery, five of&#xD;
them unfired. Somehow the work -had been carelessly or im-&#xD;
properly done, and the first two had exploded before the rest&#xD;
were laid; and the horrible mingling of sulphurous odors and&#xD;
burnt flesh loaded the thick air ; and bits of rock were scattered&#xD;
all around the place. George took up the body in his arms&#xD;
and carried it down to the shaft and laid him at its mouth, and&#xD;
covered the shattered face with his handkerchief, and turned&#xD;
back to his work. As he hurried past the boveda, he heard a&#xD;
- scratching, scuffling noise, mixed with squealing and squeaking,&#xD;
which sounded oddly enough in the echoing chamber, and,&#xD;
stout:llow as he was, he nearly shuddered to find himself sur-&#xD;
rounded by hundreds of rats, who gambolled about him and ran-&#xD;
over him with every sign of delighted welcome. The lowest level&#xD;
had been unworked for a month or so, and these creatures,.&#xD;
were rejoiced to see humanity once more. That rats inhabit&#xD;
the deepest of the mines is well known, but how they subsist is&#xD;
not so clearly ascertained. After a little civilized creeping of&#xD;
his flesh, George sat down on a tram to observe what they&#xD;
would be at. They climbed up, and filed in squads, leaping a&#xD;
dozen times their length, standing upright and playing their fore-&#xD;
feet like, professional boxers; catching each other by the tail,&#xD;
mixing up in grotesque antics, till he rose to go toward the blast,&#xD;
when they, followed him, and marched in platoons beside and&#xD;
bO Id him.. As soon as he began laying the trains, however,&#xD;
they vanished : they knew all about gunpowder, and scamp&#xD;
ered off. le fired the slow.matches-six of themand hastened&#xD;

from the death at his back. As he neared the shaft, he came&#xD;
again upon his friends the rats, but they had forgotten him:&#xD;
they had discovered the .body of the poor j egador, and strug-&#xD;
gled around and over it, tearing and devouring ; and the basket.&#xD;
had gone up out of George's reach : he saw it, by the light of&#xD;
his candle, slowly ascending. The tremendous, power he put&#xD;
forth for his life could not enable him to leap high enough to&#xD;
seize it. The commotion the rats had made.,scrambling about',&#xD;
it had been mistaken by those at the top for a signal. and-the&#xD;
fatal matches were slowly firing behind him in the new gallery!&#xD;
Just one instant the blood stopped in his heart, and sparks&#xD;
kindled in his eyes ; then his cool courage returned, and he set&#xD;
off to undo his work. He neared the trains with lightning swift.&#xD;
ness ; he tore up the kindling threads -dne ! two ! three!-&#xD;
six! - he was safe ! and after an instant's deep breath he started&#xD;
back, hoping to find the basket in its place again - of course they&#xD;
must instantly send it down, when they found there was no explo-&#xD;
sion and that it had confe up empty ; but a-new peril awaited&#xD;
him, - his candle was burning low, and he must dare the rats so&#xD;
as to be at the mouth before darkness overtook him. He shouted&#xD;
and clapped his hands, and the horrible noise he was approach-&#xD;
ing ceased for an instant ; but before he reached them his&#xD;
taper flared up and expired in its socket, leaving him in a thick&#xD;
darkness that might be felt, and his dreadful neighbors between&#xD;
him and the rope. No human voice could reach the -upper&#xD;
world; and he slowly felt his way, keeping close to the side- of&#xD;
the gallery. Twenty or thirty steps he made in safety, and then&#xD;
he set his foot upon a yielding body, and hastily withdrew it.&#xD;
With a squeal of rage, the rat he had wounded set his teeth into&#xD;
his leg, and his fellows swarmed upon :him to avenge their com-&#xD;
rade. George fought them off and clenched his teeth. Keeping&#xD;
one hand upon the wall, he pushed oh; still there was no&#xD;

basket, anj his utmost efforts could not hold .his enemies long&#xD;
at bay. He thought he must be close to the mouth but could see&#xD;
no light. His hands were covered with blood, his legs had al-&#xD;
ready many wounds from the sharp teeth seeking his life ; he&#xD;
struck out desperately and pushed them off, and ground them&#xD;
under his, feet. Glancing up in grimdespair, he espied a bright&#xD;
star. He was right, then !-this was the mouth of the shaft; but&#xD;
that star ! it was as far off as heaven ; and-- well, it was a horri-&#xD;
ble -death to die, but if' it miiust be. Something struck his&#xD;
face a smart blow, and he seized the basket with both hands&#xD;
and,.swung himself in, but not alone, for his tormentors kept&#xD;
their hold. As he slowly ascended, he managed to rid himself of&#xD;
the half-dozen who were clinging to him; and when he reached&#xD;
at length the boca mina, he held the last one clutched in his&#xD;
fingers, and- he dashed it to the earth as he stepped upon the&#xD;
firm ground once more. His shoes were full of blood, and-his&#xD;
linen clothing streaked and rimmed with the marks of his peril.&#xD;
Uncle. Alec and Otho were waiting anxiously at the top of the&#xD;
shaft, 'and the young Spaniard, Pequillo, who strode away as he&#xD;
came up.&#xD;
"My-dear fellow ! I never was so glad to . see anybody in&#xD;

head. " Iwas afraid you's' come up cold meat.; Good God!&#xD;
what is this ! why George is covered with blood!"&#xD;
George's 'face contracted, and he brushed the trickling&#xD;
drops from his cheek-; he turned deadly sick as he threw one&#xD;
thought downward to the lowest - level where' lay what was left&#xD;
of the poor-egador. Otho spoke hastily, in a voice of still&#xD;
excitement.&#xD;
"You must have help at once ! lean on' my arm, Mr. Blair; I&#xD;
see you can scarcely stand."&#xD;
&#xD;

The vibrating voice in his ear brought back George's strength,&#xD;
and he pushed past them all.&#xD;
"I've a few scratches, Mr. Craigenfels; nothing tremendous.&#xD;
Men must be sent to the lowest level at once,.with: lights. and&#xD;
arms ; there ishorrible work going on down there. The devils of&#xD;
rats are busy with that poor pegador. There's no danger from the&#xD;
blasts; the matches are all safe. Come, you administrador, don't&#xD;
stand staring there- push on your men, quick ! The Thibet&#xD;
dog greeted George with a piteous howl; and the young Dhole's&#xD;
bright eyes suffused with blood, as he kept close at his master's&#xD;
side ; his fierce wild nature kindled within him as he snuffed .the&#xD;
dripping garments, and he drew back his lips from his sharp&#xD;
teeth and gave voice to a dangerous snarl. George had firm..&#xD;
ness of hand enough left tooguide his brazcador, who had stood&#xD;
proudly arching his neck in absolute stillness where he was left,&#xD;
and he- dashed joyously off with his burden. Hilario was gone&#xD;
with his caratella when he reached -San Christabel, but he came&#xD;
upon the old yellow-skinned Chapet, talking with Bequilto, and&#xD;
her parchment claw clutched a bright, gold: piece which she. hid&#xD;
out 'of sight as . he galloped by, and she crept stea;thly be-&#xD;
neath the thick acacias, which closed up behind her.&#xD;
Dismounting -at; the broad ' veranda, George called Zitella,&#xD;
who came tripping. fram the garden her hands full of roses,&#xD;
which she dropped at eightt ofhis blood:and wounds.&#xD;
" Quick ! Zitella, girl ! brh g n some band4g  and  ba in&#xD;

child-! I'm not dead yet ; oh, no, I'm good for any amount of&#xD;
fortune's hard knocks. Men don't die so easily.&#xD;
As the giant set his teeth in grim endurance of the stnging&#xD;
pain, the young Indian girl flew to thehedge and gathered .her&#xD;
arms full of a broad-leaved plant which she made haste to&#xD;

pound and apply to the wounds. While she was still busy, Otho&#xD;
came walking with quick step ; he was very white, and.he spoke&#xD;
with an air of-lofty superiority, which all his desire to serve&#xD;
could not control.&#xD;
"Mr. Blair, pray permit me .to examine your wounds. It was&#xD;
a narrow escape; fortunately I always carry my instruments&#xD;
about me."&#xD;
George lowered the poultice he was holding to his cheek, and&#xD;
held it in his great shapely hand, while he looked in the young&#xD;
doctgris face.&#xD;
" I do not mind such wounds as these : they are only skin&#xD;
deep, and easily healed.  'Go thy way with a merry heart,&#xD;
and eat thy bread with joy.'  I thank my God that he-has not&#xD;
brought me so low as to need help from you ! And turning&#xD;
his back, he impatiently called, "Come, Zitella! hasten, and&#xD;
make a finish with your cataplasms. I must get out of this;&#xD;
my work is waiting for me."&#xD;
Otho Groenveldt's eyes kindled. He had so far overcome&#xD;
his disgust at George Blair's conduct as to offer service, and&#xD;
this was the answer he got ! He was astonished, too, at:the&#xD;
black look which accompanied it --,the deep hate, almost; and&#xD;
he solved the problem to his own satisfaction, thus:&#xD;
"When a man does a deed which' makes him despise him.&#xD;
self, he hates all who knew him in his true manhood. My&#xD;
prefer  here is a reproach to him. I was a dear and tried&#xD;
friend to poor Ruthie."&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
ThE TRIANGULAR DUEL.&#xD;
HE glimmering dawn fought with the yellow gas-light,&#xD;
and a sick girl lay tossing and moaning on her restless&#xD;
bed. All Deacon Williams's household were asleep,&#xD;
and Sonsie Eagan sat watching Mary Ann, in the half darkness,&#xD;
and dipping a soft sponge in the cooling lotion at her side, atid&#xD;
tenderly touching her heated forehead. This young Irish lassie&#xD;
had had the door slammed in her face when she left the Dea-&#xD;
con's service, and her bits of duds chucked at het from the&#xD;
garret window, with hard words enough to give the bundle bal-&#xD;
last; but Mary Ann was"down with fever now. She hardly bore&#xD;
the journey from" Rosenbloom; and sick folks have whims:&#xD;
with her arms around her father's -neck, she 'begged to have&#xD;
Sonsie Eagan to nurse her. 'The thrifty Mamma Williams in a&#xD;
sick-room was like a bull in a china shop, -she knocked every&#xD;
thing over, and picked every thing up, and slashed every thing&#xD;
into place remorselessly ; she banged the doors and:-clattered&#xD;
the dishes.; she bathed the patient's head by the job, and put&#xD;
her muscle into the labor ; and punched the pillows,and scold-&#xD;
ed, in "a loud voice, rising early," about the trouble itwasp and&#xD;
the housework she was neglecting, and the expense and doc-&#xD;

this first sickness among his offshoots. He nursed Mary Ann&#xD;
whenever he got the chance, and inclined a pitying ear to all&#xD;
her whispered requests. As soon as 'he found out this whim,&#xD;
'he put on his tall hat, sneaked out of the back door, and went&#xD;
off to Ruth Blair's to fetch Sonsie.  He hardly dared think&#xD;
how it was to be accomplished, but he trusted much to the posi-&#xD;
tive, bright-skinned, wide-awake girl, for maintaining the posi-&#xD;
tion he was about to beg her to take,,without any W. P. to&#xD;
back him.&#xD;
Sonsie listened with her eyes on his, and comprehended the&#xD;
whole thing at once.&#xD;
"Niver mind going back with me,.sir," said she.; "I'll man-&#xD;
age fqr myself. Miss Mary Ann was always good to me ; and&#xD;
she. shan't ask .me twic't to come to her. I'll get a stitch or&#xD;
two ,of clothes together, and speak a, word to Mrs. Blair, and&#xD;
be off in a half-hour. Ye may set yersel at aise, just, sir."&#xD;
"Yes, Sonsie, we're a band of brothers, as you may say,&#xD;
seemingly. I was 'ena'mpst afraid you wouldn't come.. Miss&#xD;

When the Deaconess came up with a broom in her hand&#xD;
and a towel pinned .around her head, she opened her'eYes.&#xD;
Sonsie was gently bathing the patient's face. She had combed&#xD;
her hair, straightened the bed, and was smiling while she talked&#xD;
in a sweet crooning voice like a lullaby ; and the sick gil fol-&#xD;
lowed all her motions with languid enjoyment and grateful&#xD;
love.&#xD;
"The massey me ! What are you here for, I should admire&#xD;
to know ?  Did you fly in, or how?"&#xD;
"I'm nursing Miss Mary Ann, just," whispered Sonsie.&#xD;
"Don't ye be talking' so loud, mistress : she's dropinvoff. gi&#xD;

Sonsie had met Dr. Jenkins on the' way down, and explained&#xD;
her mission, and knew he was coming up ; and she counted&#xD;
on him to sustain the position she was so positive  asiumin&#xD;
" There's no way but to be raster, you know, Sonsie,} saidshe&#xD;

her capacity.. I am exceedingly glad you sent for her. I was&#xD;
about to 'propose it ; of course, your mother-wisdom has gone&#xD;
ahead of :me."&#xD;
Mrs. Williams said not a word, but picked up her besom&#xD;
and duster and vanished, secretly glad to, be rid of, the oner.&#xD;
ous charge.&#xD;
The sick-room was thereafter Sonsie's kingdom, and the doe.&#xD;
tor her prime-minister. The loud, domineering mother reaped&#xD;
what she had sown.  Her daughter's eyes turned away from&#xD;
her ; -her forehead contracted into a troubled frown when she&#xD;
heard the; maternal accents, harsh andrasping ; and she rested&#xD;
more easily in. her absence. But the ruddy-faced nurse got&#xD;
smiles in return for the hearty, hopeful words she " poured out&#xD;
in her cheery, rich brogue ; and it was she who read the com-&#xD;
fingpsalms, and, theinspiring promises, from the Holy Book&#xD;
whi   sherhad learnedato peruse.&#xD;
"Indade, then, 'twas a good day that ye tached me to read,&#xD;

She sang the plaintive hymns she jgot to love, - " The Shin-&#xD;

and "Down by the Margin of the River."'&#xD;

could banish her fpars and repose in simple trust upon the kind&#xD;
heart of her Christ, and feel the placid joy of sins forgiven&#xD;
stealing intoher soul,  such peace as the world nor gives nor&#xD;
takes away.&#xD;
Sonsie had a secret of Mary Ann's, betrayed in the long,&#xD;
weary night-watches, which made her uneasy.  This thin-&#xD;
skinned, passionless girl had -managed to get in love with Cym-&#xD;
balinus Adolphus Brown, Captain Slocuns exquisite nephew,&#xD;
the great originator of many "riddles;" and she raved of him&#xD;
when the fever kindled in her brain, and Sonsie heard her min-&#xD;
gle his name with her prayers.. The selfish,,supercilious puppy&#xD;
who -thanks to Belle Brandon's egging on, and to her own&#xD;
simplicity - was glorified in her thoughts, ought to have got- a&#xD;
blessing out of the fervent petition.&#xD;
Sonsie also knew the whole ,history of .theianonymous letter&#xD;
which had broken up the Blair family and sent the young hus-&#xD;
band off no one knew whither ; for poor Mary Ann told it&#xD;
over and over to her,; and. wept and grieved sorely over her&#xD;
share in the cowardly performance ; and str igh forward Sonsie&#xD;
took a private .reslution on the subject, which she only waited&#xD;
a suitable tine 'to carry into effect.&#xD;
"'Confession is good for the soul,"' said;she.; "and T'll just&#xD;

and odd jobs, while the sick girl slept, or the Deacon sat with&#xD;
her: hard work never put Sonsie out ; but she had trouble to&#xD;
keep her pert Irish, tongue still under the Deaconess's flings:&#xD;
she saw so many good places for touching her up ; so many&#xD;
flaws in her armor for her arrows of fun and sharp hits.&#xD;
Here, you, Sonsie !-here's a towel to wipe your face on, and&#xD;
not be using other folks's; you'd best mark it with a cross on&#xD;
the corner, you're such a hot Catholic."&#xD;
"Indade, mistress, unless you'd give it me for my own,&#xD;
'twould be a pity to spoil it for yez ; you'd niver get any good&#xD;
of it afterwards, wid the holy cross upon it !" answered Sonsie,&#xD;
taking. the towel in her hands and examining it, while she&#xD;
twinkled her eyes merrily.&#xD;
"Why not, pray?"'&#xD;
" Sure and faith, ma'am, and isn't it onpossible for the Devil&#xD;
ever to tetch any thing that's got the blessed mark upon it?"&#xD;
"Humph ! Better go and mumble some of your lating&#xD;
prayers and keep your sassy tongue busy."&#xD;
"Thank ye kindly, mistress! I don'f need to pray any more&#xD;
this day  I can't expect God will forgit my praying so quick&#xD;
as this; in particular as He knows this house needs the bles-&#xD;
sing I was askin' 'em for; but I shall say a Deo gratias when&#xD;
yer poor ininocent-girl gets up again, and I'm going back to Miss&#xD;
Ruthie, just."&#xD;
As the dame had' a cambric handkerchief she shedd Sonsie to&#xD;
henistitch, she forbore to tax her further, and relieved her sur-&#xD;
charged feelings by a sharp box on Payson's ears instead; and&#xD;
then threw a black shawl over Mary Ann's bobolink, who was&#xD;
carolling a joyous song for his sick mistress, which sable ex-'&#xD;
tinguisher Sonsie quietly removed as soon as her stoutness. dis-&#xD;
appeared; ani then she came smiling back to her" charge,and&#xD;

chatted while she pulled the gossamer threads, and set the dainty&#xD;
stitches.&#xD;
" Listen, Miss- Mary Ann, till I tell you what I heard this&#xD;
morning while I was waiting for yer patherns: 'Tis in, idle&#xD;
hearts,' says Miss Zoe, says she, ' that love and mischief are&#xD;
most nimble. The safest shield against the darts of Cupid, is&#xD;
Minerva's thimble.' And Miss Sabrina said, 'Amen.' Now&#xD;
what do you suppose it means, then?&#xD;
Though Sonsie repeated the couplet in a sing-song way, she&#xD;
had not lost a word; in fact, it had been running in her head&#xD;
ever since.&#xD;
"Oh dear! I don't know," answered Mary Ann, sadly. "I&#xD;
wish I was smart, so that I could tell you all such things; but&#xD;
Belle Brandon always said I was stupid, and I'm afraid 'tis the&#xD;
truth."&#xD;
"Don't give her the breath of your two lane lips to spake&#xD;
her name, Miss Mary Ann I ' interrupted Sonsie, with an energy&#xD;
of disgust, in which the thought of the treatment Jan Vedde&#xD;
had got at the hands of that blonde beauty, mingled unconsciously&#xD;
with her indignation, over the way the poor girl before her had&#xD;
been played upon and cat's-pawed.&#xD;
"Well, never mind; I'll try to be good and true, Sonsi  edr,&#xD;
just as I am. You remember--oh, my dear Mr. Growing" (she&#xD;
held out her thin hand to the'pastor),- "I'm so glad to see you!&#xD;
you always come just in the right time. Now here'sSonsie&#xD;
asking all kinds of hard questions. 1 never could ansiver hard&#xD;
questions; and it is proper nice to have you to set her at- you&#xD;

Maybe'tis the Holy Mary and the saints, just."&#xD;
Mr. Growing rubbed his hands delightedly.&#xD;

health-walk, my good"child,'and I'll give you some books that&#xD;
will help you. "I like girls and boys who are willing to study."&#xD;

" This evening ! Why, Sonsie, what shall -I do without you ?"&#xD;
(Mary Ann's eyes filled); "you are such a comfort to me; but I&#xD;
know you ought to go. Poor Mrs. Blair looked tired yesterday.&#xD;
She was walking with her head down and she would not ride&#xD;
with me. She will hate me, Sonsie, when she knows; wont&#xD;

But Mrs..Deacon had privately made up her mind to retain&#xD;
the services of. handy Sonsie. Her brisk and willing hands&#xD;
turned off so much more work than any other girl she ever got,&#xD;
she hated to part with her ; and she was struggling with her&#xD;
stinginess to make a decent offer of wages.. She broached the&#xD;
subject at a low figure, leaving . herself a margin for rise, and&#xD;
Mary Ann tightened her clasp of Sonsie's warm hand so sud-&#xD;
denly that it took the impulsive Irish girl a few minutes to de-&#xD;
cide what was duty. It was soon plain, however - Ruth Blair&#xD;
lonely, and her weary hands full of work.&#xD;
" I said-to her, I'm coon to be the little mouse to yez, on that&#xD;

" Oh mother, don't !" sobbed poor Mary Ann; ''you kill me.&#xD;
Oh, dear, I'm-,a dreffgilwicked sinner - Ip"&#xD;
" There,-there.! Miss Mary, dear; don't be talkin'.i She&#xD;
knows, and we know, and God knows, and that's -enough,"&#xD;
&#xD;
whispered Sonsie, stoping over to arrange the sick girl's shawl.&#xD;
"St -st ! your pa is coming up the wok. Wipeup your eyes,&#xD;
and don't hurt his kind heart wid yer sorrowful fce. He'll&#xD;
stop along wid yefor a couple of hours, while I get merun."&#xD;
The question of going was;dropped for the present. The&#xD;
Deaconess tramped off to hurry up Nora, and Mary A nobeyed&#xD;
Sonsie, and settled herself for a good, quiet, cheerful talk with&#xD;
her father. She. was convalescent now, and- exceeding gentle&#xD;
and patient. Indeed her nurse complained that she "didn't&#xD;
make trouble enough to pay a girl for setting' up to her." She&#xD;
was fond of reading Christ's life, dand silently thinkingabout&#xD;
Him afterwards. She had some knitting pins, and was raking&#xD;
table-mats, ,which were (she said) for Sonsie's housekeeping;&#xD;
but a few rounds were enough to tire her weak fingers  She&#xD;
had got a couple of letters-from Filer,full of newsabout Christ-&#xD;
abel Goldsmith and praises of .her;i and she kept them under&#xD;
her pillow, and said nobody in the world was ever so good to&#xD;
her as Christabel and Filer (poor red-nosedJiler_ 1the little&#xD;
floating teacher, at Rosenbloom, where she had been so ill and&#xD;
so unhappy), ,except her own, very awn Sonsie."&#xD;
But Sonsie could be spared quite well now ; and so she was&#xD;
going to have what she loved of all things,-a gong&amp;amp;walk.&#xD;
She had not grown thin or pale with her nursing  shehad&#xD;
learned the laws of health; too well for that thanks to Ruth&#xD;
Blair's teaching and her own good sense appleation; andshe&#xD;
never failed to take her exercise and her cold bath every day.&#xD;
The Deaconess looked sour about the use of her var isKed&#xD;
bath-place, wh ch, though elaborately fitted up, was .ept for&#xD;
show; the chi drgn performing their scanty ablutions in the&#xD;
"sink-room," under the, pump, and.,. the,, Deacon g ti.g a&#xD;

errand.&#xD;
The building-committee came out of the new  church, Fnd&#xD;
Jan Vedder stopped to shake hands and inquire after her&#xD;
patient ; and he looked narrowly at the wide-awake girl, and&#xD;
begged her to take good care 'and keep  vel&#xD;

in a shealing."&#xD;
"Sonsie, Sonsie ! said Jan, impatiently, "how exceedingly&#xD;
unpleasant you can be sometimes!"&#xD;
She looked at him half-roguish, half-sorrowful.. "Just wait&#xD;
till I've me idication, sir," she called out, over her shoulders, as&#xD;
she walked proudly away from him. They had many such bits.&#xD;
of tak and-with similar results.&#xD;
 Jade's face was exceedingly sober and a- little downcast after&#xD;
he had parted with the Irish lassie, who stepped briskly on her&#xD;
road, thinking somewhat about him and more about her plans&#xD;
for getting the idication she was so fully resolved to have.&#xD;
Sabrjga.Bradshaw wasvery kind, and gave her, in addition to&#xD;
the books, a bueh of fresh flwers, and some. excellent advice&#xD;
how to read; all of.which kindled a perfect gl ow of gratitude in&#xD;
the fervid breast, so impressible to fall emotions and so grateful&#xD;
for kindness; and after a burst of thanks, which made Sabrina&#xD;
smile, she bade her adieu and hurried away.&#xD;
Down by the drive-way she came upon the gardener clipping&#xD;
the Irish yews; and she stoppedand gathered her apronful&#xD;
of the slender twigs, and carried them to the Horseshoe ; and&#xD;
Tbegng someyarn of Ruth, she wound a crosslet and a wreath&#xD;
for the lonely grave in the corner of the old burying-ground,&#xD;
whose only mark was a rude wooden crux his widow had&#xD;
railed together and planted at the head ; andaf ter a .ittle frolic&#xD;
with Pigeon, who begged her to come back, to him, she started&#xD;
again, feeling how much she had gotten out of her afternoon,&#xD;
both for her oWn pleasure and also for the ears of the sick girl&#xD;
shut up at home-;&#xD;
It -vas guite darik wher she neared the graveyard; and the&#xD;
wind blew keen and sharp, and she gathered her shawl as closely&#xD;
around her arms as she could and safely hol4 her love-offerings.&#xD;

She scarcely noticed a couple of objects close to the fence, as&#xD;
she hurried in at the open gate, nor a cord drawn across. the&#xD;
posts, about two feet front the ground; just high enough to&#xD;
trip any passer's feet ; and she fell prone upon her face before&#xD;
she could free her arms. A coarse wheezy laggh greeted her,&#xD;
and stifled cries of "St-boy! chaw 'e, Plug 1" ungled with&#xD;
low vicious growling. She knew that Bax nWilliams and his dog&#xD;
were her neighbors, and that she was the victim of one ofthe&#xD;
rough jokes his soul delighted in ; but she troubled herself less&#xD;
about the well-matched pair, than for the safety of her precious&#xD;
greens ; and she struggled to get clear of her shawl and rise&#xD;
without breaking them;; but, urged on by his master, whose&#xD;
hatred of Sonsie overcame his cowar dread of consequences,&#xD;
the powerful bull-terrier sprangaupon her andheld her 4own,&#xD;
and seized her shawl and worried it. Sonsie felt his breath 'on&#xD;
her neck, and' her heart stoodstill for a, econd, $h  seen&#xD;
him tear down an ox andhold him by the throat ti he was&#xD;
beaten off with clubs.&#xD;
Bax Williams had never forgotten the scene at the old&#xD;
stumps, nor the beating he had got and hecouldnt pass&#xD;
Sonsie in his mother'shouse without curses and foulness.&#xD;
"You're faster nor that ,old tom-cat was in the trap" aid&#xD;
he, clapping his hands. "Hold her, Plug - ehawy her!,&#xD;
His ferocious bad temers were warming like snakes round&#xD;
a fire, and he had a cruel devil inside of his ugly body. So sie&#xD;
dared not stir; f  t every move she made, the dog growled&#xD;
and set his teeth firmer; and there's no knowing how near&#xD;
it might have got to murder, if Rainbow and Flirt had not&#xD;
been out for a little stroll. Flirt knew that her friend Sonsie&#xD;
was abroad, although sihadnot seen her;-and she was follow-&#xD;
ing her trail,, her black muzzle close to the ground, and barking&#xD;
conversational little barks to her comrade occasional. anut.&#xD;

&#xD;
Rainbow was the first to see the Irish girl, and his eyes gleamed&#xD;
with gteen fire; and his tail got tremendous when he espied also&#xD;
his detested eneny. And while Flirt dashed gallantly at the&#xD;
brutes tiroat, he stuck his nails into his flanks, and clawed and&#xD;
bit, and spit, like "forty cats all rolled into one," and Plug&#xD;
was gladcto leave: his hold rind defend himself from the allied&#xD;

two dogs rolling over in close fight, and'the cat worrying the&#xD;
rear }andi ax kept hoppin  .bout, bestowing kicks upon Flirt,&#xD;
trying to catch Rainbdw by thetail, or get a clip at his head.&#xD;
Sonsie sprang to herfeet and called and shouted at the top of&#xD;
her voice, ear andringingas an Alpine lrn. Though she&#xD;
ha  got a cut onbier lip, from which the blood was trickling,&#xD;
and a bruised nose, already the ,ize of fournoses, she had no&#xD;
notioof ab'andonrifnger favorites, in such hands. She need&#xD;
not have feared'for Flirt, either: Jan Vedder said she was made&#xD;
up of colley and-Newfoundland, with a strain of iastiff blood to&#xD;
give her steadiness ; and she would hold on like grim death'&#xD;
when once her blood was up., Flirt was a noble creature. She&#xD;
despisedPlug's favorite ganie,' flying at little dogs and break..&#xD;

surly bulldoghandsomeiy and her stubborn enduranceiqualled&#xD;
his, While her colley blood gave her vastly the advartage ;&#xD;
for she put such sprightliness and variety into her attacks, that&#xD;
the heavy, sullen iddrsary was bewilkered- and lost his head.&#xD;
They were in the thick oflit,- Flirt giving tongue occasionally,&#xD;
with her deep, mellow voice, and keeping persistentlyat her work,&#xD;
- when who should cone tearing along but Jan Vedder. He&#xD;
was already entering Daisy Meadow, dhinvaylhome, thinking&#xD;
over Sonsie's last, when her clear voice cut the still air, and the&#xD;
pinnacle threwback the echo. He knew instin ctively the tone:&#xD;
&#xD;
he remembered the first time he heard it, and 'the talkwhich&#xD;
had followed, sittiig on the mossy 'log. It had changed his&#xD;
life; and he made speed like a champioi " runnest," till With&#xD;
a last spring, he stood on the battleground, among the combatt&#xD;
tants, and Sonsie welcomed him with a little push.&#xD;
"Oh, do stop them, Mtr.Yedder! make Bax call him off.&#xD;
My poor Flirt will surely be killed; and there's Rainbowtoo,&#xD;
-he's init !"&#xD;
Before Jan had timte to interfere, Plu had got enoughind&#xD;
limped away, the blood streaming front his:lips and onde marin&#xD;
shreds; and his master, 'seeiig his plight, and the new aly in&#xD;
the field, made haste to sneak after him. He had had some&#xD;
little revenges for his whipping, suchas killing off a whole&#xD;
brood of Spanish fowls,'whichid cost Jan nearly:heir'weight&#xD;
in money, and poisoning a beautiful black andawhiteIish et.&#xD;
ter, whose intelligence and tricksere fanous;buthe hated&#xD;
and feared him still.&#xD;
When they'were gone, and Flirt sat'down to lick her wounds&#xD;
in a most methodical and businesslike' manner, she' tried up&#xD;
her bright, mild eye in giswer to Jais praise, and experienced&#xD;
the pleasant consciousness of hinng"acted well her part."&#xD;

"It wasn't pleasant, Mr. Vedder.  His hot breath just&#xD;

"But, Sonsie, I can't leave you here in this eery place. I&#xD;

defenceless girl. You make less of me than that dog."&#xD;
Sonsie laughed. "An' is it 'defenceless,' sir ? 'Tis a brave,&#xD;

walked by her side, and helped.her arrange her love-gifts.&#xD;

would have, had wet eyes,-ti know, if you had seen hers, so&#xD;
lustrous, violet-deep were they ; so full of passionate joy; so&#xD;
brimming with tears which rained down her crimson cheeks. A&#xD;
simple crux of white marble replaced the rude wooden cross&#xD;
she had left, and her faded yew wreath lay at its foot ; the&#xD;
grave wasall turfed and rounded,,and a wlite rose sprung and&#xD;
bloomed from the centre, but that was - well, I must not get&#xD;

"CONFESSION IS GOOD FOR       4E SOUL.     113&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
"CONFESSION IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL."&#xD;
HE next morning Sonsie dressed her patient, "by easy&#xD;
stages," and dressed her carefully ; and during all her&#xD;
brisk stepping about, putting things to rights, the poor&#xD;
girl's eyes followed her motions in meek patience; though she&#xD;
did not know the bit of fun which was twisting the corners of&#xD;
the ripe mouth she watched into such mischievous dingples,&#xD;
she smiled faintly sometimes through her anxieties.&#xD;
Sonsie had been out gathering sorrel for the bobolink that&#xD;
morning; and coming into the yard, with her hands full, she&#xD;
stopped a moment to look at a picturesque charcoal-man, who&#xD;
was coming through the gate. He had given himself a fierce&#xD;
mustache, and brigand eyebrows, with his talley-coal, and wore&#xD;
his old hat with a wild slouch, and pealed - out his cry in such&#xD;
musical tones as proved the pleasure and pride he had in his&#xD;
rich voice.&#xD;
Mrs. Williamsimmediately flew at her favorite amusement,-&#xD;
cheapening and drawing a hard bargain; and Sonsie loitered&#xD;
long enough to hear the final agreement. He was to give-the&#xD;
coal for twelve cents, put it in barrels, and hea them up.&#xD;
Going down afterwards, with her broom (which must be hung&#xD;
on A particular nail behind the door, on pain of death), she&#xD;
foundtihe Deaconess boiling over, and scolding a blue streak.&#xD;
The sunning wag of a peddler had turned the barrels upside&#xD;

down, heaped the heads .scripture measure, and left for parts&#xD;
unknown, and the dame had got about half a peck of coal on&#xD;
each cask for her bargain ; and the hearty mirth in which Sonsie&#xD;
and Nora indulged did not assuage her wrath.&#xD;
The kind, sympathetic nurse soon forgot her amusement,&#xD;
though ; for Mary Ann began to talk about her coming trial;&#xD;
and she set herself to inspire her faint heart with courage to do&#xD;
her duty bravely. It was a phase of character she could not&#xD;
'understand ; because her first impulse was always to spring to&#xD;
any task she saw before her, and confess and repair any wrong&#xD;
she had done ; and a little something akin to contempt mingled&#xD;
with her pity for the invalid's weakness.&#xD;
"She'll despise me dreadfully, wont she, Sonsie ? " said&#xD;
Mary Ann, for the fortieth time. "I know she, will. It was a&#xD;
proper mean trick. I'm sorry. I'd be willing to " (she turned&#xD;
over in her mind the greatest sacrifice she could make)-"I'd&#xD;
,have all my hair pulled out by the roots if I could get back&#xD;
the minute I did it in. I would, truly. . I ought to be willing&#xD;
to let her despise me, I know."&#xD;
"Indade and indade, she'll do no such thing, Miss Mary Ann.&#xD;
Ye were but the handle to the shovel, anyhow ; there's no oc-&#xD;
casion to feel so 'about it. Miss Ruthie is- far too good and&#xD;
sweet to hate anybody, even the bloody villian of a Belle Bran-&#xD;
don hersel; but ye needn't go just to-day, unless ye feel ripe&#xD;
for it; we'll drive around a bit, and come back home, if it likes&#xD;
ye better."&#xD;
"No, Sonsie ; I'll go to-day. I shall feel better when it is&#xD;
over."&#xD;
"Yes,.mavourneen, 'confession is good for the soul.' Our&#xD;
priests tell us that, sure. They lane us of every thing, and&#xD;
le1ss us up s good as new."&#xD;
"'But it isn't good to confess to them, Sbnisie. The Bible&#xD;
&#xD;
"CONFESSION IS GOOD FOk THE SOUL."           116&#xD;
says, ' Confess your faults 'to One another.' They can't give a&#xD;
true blessing."&#xD;
" And they are one another ! aren't they?" replied Sonsie,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
Mary Ann did' not feel strong enough for an argument with&#xD;
her sharp nurse, but she privately thought she'd speak to Mr.&#xD;
Growing about it, and went back to her own trouble.&#xD;
" You'll stay close by me, wont you, Sonsie, and keep 'hold&#xD;
of my hand, and let me lean on your heart ? You're not afraid&#xD;
of folks ; but then you never did the awful things I went and&#xD;
did that time. Oh dear ! "&#xD;
"Miss Mary Ann ! " exclaimed Sonsie, pausing with the&#xD;
hair-brush in her hand,"and gazing reproachfully 'upon her weak&#xD;
charge, "how can-yez.be always forgetting yer promise to Mr.&#xD;
Growing? "&#xD;
"I wont, Sonsie dear, I wont ; don't be hard with me. I&#xD;
feel so bad," said Mary Ann, wiping her eyes. "I want to be&#xD;
good. I think God has heard my prayers, and I hope he will&#xD;
forgive my sins."&#xD;
I'm sure of it'! " answered Sonsie, stoutly. "-Don't it say in&#xD;
the Bible, up to siventy times siven? 'Come, come ! let me&#xD;
freshen ye up now, before the top of the morning is all shaded&#xD;
over.&#xD;
Ruth Blair was gentle and kind to'the penitent, and took her&#xD;
in her arms and kissed her; but the interview cost her a sleep-&#xD;
less night, for she had to go over' all the past, -her follies and&#xD;
her wrongs.&#xD;
That evening Sonsie' presented herself to the Deaconess.&#xD;
She had take ialeave of her young lady, and her eyes=were&#xD;
rather red, 'and hevoice had not quite"its:nsiialonfdenttone.&#xD;

efforts to retain "the girl having been unavailing. "Here's&#xD;
your wages,-a dollar and a half a week. I could'a' done all&#xD;
the nussin' myself! Just like pitchin' money into the road!&#xD;

Sonsie looked at her, and up went. her arms on to her hips,&#xD;
belligerently.&#xD;
"Good nurses get six dollars, ma'am ; and I'll leave it out&#xD;
with Miss Mary Ann if I am not just that ! Dr. Jenkins of-&#xD;
fered-me eight to go into his hospital. It was the Deacon's&#xD;

You just take your money and trot right off."&#xD;
Sonsie looked at Mary Ann, frightened and troubled, and&#xD;
kept her temper.,&#xD;
"Don't be onaisy, mistress-; I'll not be meddlin' with yer&#xD;
Deacon; though he's a kind, easy man, and he's got an eye for&#xD;
a bright cheek and a trim foot, if he is a deacon. I have a&#xD;
great respect for him, especially since-'I've noticed how good&#xD;
and clever he was to his sick girl-as tinder as-a woman; and,&#xD;
'tis- rue for you, I. know some women, not a mile off, as hard&#xD;

Bax and his dog were lounging at the gate.&#xD;
"Good-by, Master Bax; and sure ye'll be glad of the news&#xD;
I'm tellin' ye.  I'm goin' to leave ye," said she, pleasantly.&#xD;
"But yer dog didn't fight as good as he used those timds; did&#xD;

chnge in her daughter aftr. hed sickness. She had&#xD;

MARY ANN AND THE DEAO&#xD;
&#xD;
ter left at the parsonage were. so many hugs from the grateful&#xD;
Deacon. He never mentioned them to his wife, however;&#xD;
nor did he think it needful to.speak of the thousand dollars he&#xD;
handed him as his church-subscription.&#xD;
The warmth and glow of Mary Ann's newly-kindled lamp&#xD;
shed its radiance over her home and lighted up the Deacon&#xD;
and the children with its friendly gleam. A thousand tender&#xD;
actions, pretty attentions, gladdened the father's heart, and&#xD;
made the hours spent with her cheerful and agreeable. She&#xD;
brought his Bible ; and she found the hymns . for him, and&#xD;
chose a place close to 'his side in the family devotions-; and&#xD;
though her voice was thin, and a little sharp, the weakly good&#xD;
man loved to hear it ; and he had to wipe his glasses ,'some-&#xD;
times, after the tune was finished, and clear his husky throat for&#xD;
the prayer. Though he still wandered through mazes of uncer-&#xD;
tain English in his petitions, and." 'ena'most hoped and feared,"&#xD;
and mangled his scriptural quotations, he enjoyed the exercise,&#xD;
and got help out of it. He prayed;- and I have no doubt Sa-&#xD;
tan had plenty of ague-fits; because "he trembles when he sees&#xD;
the weakest saint upon his knees." Not all the twitches and&#xD;
slaps his wife bestowed upon the helpless children, nor her loud-&#xD;
voiced scolding, -.interpolated and intruded among the exer-&#xD;
cises, could altogether spoil their comfort ; and Mary Ann soon&#xD;
contrived to have little Nancy's stool by her; and she coaxed&#xD;
Tip to sit by his father, out of the reach of Bax and 1ysi;&#xD;
and they were as good as kittens, and' even helped out the&#xD;
psalmody with their pipingnotes. True, they strayed hopelessly&#xD;
from the tune and fugued rather sometimes;"and when the Dea-&#xD;
con shut up the books and said "let us pray,",there was rush&#xD;
to see who would kneel first ; and they watched zealously for&#xD;
his "Amen," that they might spring up, exulting in their ni -&#xD;
bleness.&#xD;

MARY ANN AND THE DEACON;&#xD;
&#xD;
Mary Ann Williams looked different too'- more alive ; and&#xD;
she put better heart into her daily tasks; and swept and dusted,&#xD;
and made pastry, and 'darned stockings, all in so industrious,&#xD;
perfect, and methodical a manner, that the Deaconess glorified&#xD;
herself greatly upon her system  of fetching ' on her up."&#xD;
She had a little romance -poor child ! - all to herself. Cyn-&#xD;
balinus Adolphus called occasionally-oftener, indeed, than the&#xD;
Deacon liked; and as he happened to say as much to his wife,&#xD;
one day, she immediately invited him out to "ice cream," which&#xD;
she concocted herself, out of corn-starch and "'skim-milk," and&#xD;
kept Mary Annin the wood-house, stirring, all the afternoon.&#xD;
When the Deacon noticed how pleased his daughter was with&#xD;
theyoung fellow, and. how she chatted and smiled, he tried&#xD;
har d to find some trustworthy qualities in the poor fop, with his&#xD;
silly conundrums, his crush hat, and his glass, which it made him&#xD;
dizzy to use ; but he could not like him, - and he proposed to&#xD;
send the girl to -school for a twelvemonth, thinking to get rid&#xD;
of Cabby in her absence ; but his helpmeet. came down sharp&#xD;
and told him " to stir his stumps and find out how much money&#xD;
old Brown was w    ;uth" and he Was forced to report thous-&#xD;
ands; and then he was comnianded to "hold his tongue and let&#xD;
things wag," and more to the same purpose, but all equally&#xD;
choice antd elegant, and as full of exquisite riiotherliness ; and he&#xD;
was glad to abandon his idea and rush off to his Gonecusset&#xD;
office, as to a stronghold and tower of defence.&#xD;
Mary Ann had some 'hours of quiet happiness too. The&#xD;
Horseshoe was always open'to her, even when it was shut to&#xD;
brighter 'folks; 'and she used often to be there. In Ruth's&#xD;
school-hours she helped Sonsie mend .her clothes, and showed&#xD;
her' all sorts-of fahey kntting and- crocheting, and the like, in,&#xD;
which she =was rarely' skilful and they two made over gar-&#xD;

and so escaped his death ; and Hans, who had .taken several&#xD;

Sonsie Egan had a basket on her arm full of turkeys' eggs,:&#xD;
she was going to try her hand at raising some poults, and had&#xD;
been over to Mrs. Captain Slocum to get the eggs and the di-&#xD;
rections; the first, she paid for in knitting, and the second,.she&#xD;
received with many thanks, though she knew very nearly as&#xD;
much about it as her slim little teacher.; being carefully ob-&#xD;
servant of every thing which came under her keen vision. Dul-&#xD;
cet, though a thrifty, careful housekeeper, would gladly have&#xD;
presented the eggs to Sonsie ; but that lassie had ideas of her&#xD;
own on the subject, and was positive:&#xD;
" I can hold up me head higher, ma'am," said she, if I pay&#xD;
me way."&#xD;
The Captain looked at her, and thought she held it plenty&#xD;
high enough ; but he gave tongue to one of his pealing "haw-&#xD;
haws," and remarked, -&#xD;
"Quite right, my girl ! Independence is about the ticket;&#xD;
but, you see, Miss Slocum she likes to hold her head up too,&#xD;
and she can't unless she squares her bargains handsomely for&#xD;
all she gets. And, by the way, Sonsie, I've got a pig,  I've&#xD;
got lots of pigs in fact, -but this little black feller is an or-&#xD;
phan; his mammy died and left him, Sonsie. to squeal alone.&#xD;

he draws too much upon my sympathies. You shall take him,&#xD;
and fetch him up carefully, and I'll pay you for your kindness.&#xD;
The apple-parings, and pumpkin-rines, and sich, that you have&#xD;
over there to Miss Blair's, '11 fill up his skin as slick as a&#xD;
mitten; 'for who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto&#xD;
more than he?' and when he's fat, UI'l buy him of yo i.&#xD;
Sonsie's eyes twinkled. The oddity of the statement tickled&#xD;
her sense of fun, and she readily consented to adopt the orphan.&#xD;
So she was taking home the turkey's eggs, and thinking how&#xD;
Dennis should build a pen for the black pig who was an or-&#xD;
phan, when she was overtaken by a tall, well-made fellow, with&#xD;
a soft hat stuck'sidewise on his head, a game-bag slung across&#xD;
his back, and a Sharp's rifle over his shoulder; his legs were&#xD;
encased in hunting-boots,'whose red tops reached half-way up&#xD;
his thighs; and his long strides brought him to -the side of the&#xD;
young girl, whom he -greeted with very manifest pleasure.&#xD;
Sonsie Eagan had the deep interest in Jan Vedder which a&#xD;
warn-hearted -woman always takes in a man she has tried to&#xD;
benefit, and she was proud of him, too, in a curious, far-off way;&#xD;
she loved to hear people say, "What a fine fellow he was! what&#xD;
a hunter ! what a fisherman ! what a good worker !"  She told&#xD;
him the pig story, and he laughed heartily.&#xD;
"Why, Sonsie, you'll come .to be a real farmer before you&#xD;
know it. I've got a poor heifer, who is a lone orphan, you&#xD;
had better take her, too."&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Vedder ; but Miss Ruthie, she's got a&#xD;
fine cow of her own, and the two faymales mightn't agree."&#xD;
"But,. Sonsie, how are you to feed your bonnie black pig?&#xD;
You'll have to let me send you some corn.&#xD;
Oh, no, idade, 'sir ;' potatoes are cheap; and me mother&#xD;

"M4D DOGI"&#xD;
&#xD;
"MAD DOG!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"This is a book written by a very learned man, named Good.&#xD;
He was an English priest, who passed many years in Ireland."&#xD;
(Jan reads).&#xD;
"'The Irish are witty, warlike, and remarkable for the just pro..&#xD;
portion of thei- limbs ; their flesh and muscles are so supple that&#xD;
the agility they possess is remarkable. They are a nation greatly&#xD;
to be praised for their strength of body, and for a greatness of&#xD;
soul. They are prodigal of life, hardy i bearing fatigues, cold,&#xD;
and hunger ; courteous and kind to strangers; constant in their&#xD;
love, and in their hating also; seldom forgiving injures, too cre-&#xD;
dulous, greedy of glory, quick to resent insults."&#xD;
"Very nate !" said Sonsie, with her head up. "And now&#xD;
what does the reverend father say about the women? 'r&#xD;
" I don't see anything intarticular about the women, Sonsie ;&#xD;
the description I read you includes them, I suppose; but Sir&#xD;
Francis Head tells us, " there is in the Irish female countenance,&#xD;
an innate modesty more clearly legible, than he ever saw it in&#xD;
any other country."&#xD;
" That's true for yez, sir. Ye might say it and tell no lie at&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"I could say it of one Irish girl I know, at any rate, but I'm&#xD;
afraid she's not pure bred: these are the. native or pagan Irish&#xD;
of whom I have been telling you ; bgt in tie north, there is a&#xD;
strain of Spanish blood. Perhaps that's where you got. your&#xD;
black. hair, Sonsie. It is a matter of history that Spain and Ire-&#xD;
land were close together, in the old days when Spanish galleys&#xD;
rode the high seas ; and anybody who has been about Galway,&#xD;
knows that through all Connemara, there are plenty of Spanish&#xD;
remains, both in dress and feature, and much architecture that is'&#xD;
purely Castilian.. Lynch's Castle, for instance, that I tramped&#xD;
over, has wide entrances and arched galleries; stone uilioned&#xD;
&#xD;
148:&#xD;
&#xD;
windows, and outside staircases ; mayhap you're no true Celt,&#xD;
after all, Miss Eagan, with your beautitl brogue."&#xD;
Jan paused for the roguish, merry rejoinder he expected ; and&#xD;
was startled when he caught the look in her deep eyes. Shie&#xD;
stopped dead still, and laid a quick, light grasp upon his arni, --&#xD;
a proceeding which astonished Mr. Jan, for she was exceeding&#xD;
fond of keeping her hands to herself.&#xD;
"Look! Mr. Vedder -look !" said she, in a low, clear, voice;&#xD;
there's a horrid sight  Plug l-mind -he is shtreelin right on&#xD;
to us!"&#xD;
"Great God! Sonsie, that dog is mad ! run for your life !&#xD;
fly, - over the fence with you !"&#xD;
Before he had finished speaking, two little children,-a boy&#xD;
and a girl,- turned out of a cross-road, and came, laughing&#xD;
and kicking the loose snow and red gravel before them. They&#xD;
had a basket of pears swinging between them, and each i bag&#xD;
of pop-co  in the other hand They were Daniel Prodd y's&#xD;
twins, who had been on a visit to Grandiia Proddy, and were&#xD;
carrying home the spoils. plug, with laboring breath, was upon&#xD;
their he-els, scattering foam from his protruding tongue.&#xD;
Sonsie screamed and put wings to her feet. Seizing one under&#xD;
each arm, it was the work of a moment to drop them over the&#xD;
fence, and seat'herself on top of it; ad it was time too, forthe&#xD;
wretched brute was not two. yards off. He snappedhis teeth&#xD;
together as she darted off, seeing sorme object 4imly tlfrough his&#xD;
bleared eyes.&#xD;
"Bang! a lightning 1 ash from Jan's rifle; the ball lodged&#xD;
in the dogs forehe d, and hedroped inhistiks, stone dead.&#xD;
Jan threw down his gun and took the carcass by its great bras&#xD;
collar, dragged it into the roadside ditch, and threw a couple&#xD;
of rails over it, carefully avoiding the bloody frttli which was&#xD;
oozing from its mouth; and Sonsie' produced the speechless twins&#xD;

them to take a fearful lookat dea  Plug, she assured them&#xD;
tie: would meet Ano more mad dos (P obably), and set them&#xD;
safely out of harm's way, before she and Jai resumed' their&#xD;
homewardroute. Her heart thumped, but she aid, coolly, -&#xD;
"How lucky,   r. Veddeir that you and your rife, the pair&#xD;
of ye happened to be onth road just now! and, ltis, a good&#xD;

to her : "I'll have the doctor directly."&#xD;
" Oh, Sonsie Egan ! Oh,. Mr. Vedder ! -Don't leave me;!&#xD;
Have I got to die ?  Shall 1 be dead to night?. Oh, dear:! I&#xD;
can't die ! I'm afraid ! Mebly he wouldn't 'a bit me if I&#xD;
hadn't cuffed him round so. I'm scared to death! . Whatll&#xD;
mother do'to me ? I wish I had a went to school: I'll allus&#xD;
go arter this. You stay with me, Sonsie, wont you? I. didn't&#xD;
mean to trip- you up that time.' Ol oo ! ohoo ! how my hand:&#xD;
hurts ! It's turning black ! I'm dying.! Ohoot1 ohoo !&#xD;
"Be quiet, Bax ; never mind tellin' them lies now. Come'&#xD;
along wid me," said Sonsie, taking 'him by the sleeve : "I'll&#xD;
wash the blood before the doctor comes. I'll stop by ye, in&#xD;
course, if I can do you good. Come, pluck up ! be a man, can't&#xD;
ye ?"       _&#xD;
"Sonsie ! Sonsie ! " cried'out Jan (he had met the doctor,&#xD;
and came back breathless), "you haven't a scratch on your&#xD;
hands, have you ? Be careful how you peril your precious&#xD;
life! "&#xD;
" Nary a scratch, sir ; sound as a hazel nut !" answered she,&#xD;
holding up her fingers, spread wide, while he anxiously exam-&#xD;
ined them. "Never be thinking so much about me, Mr. Ved-&#xD;

.Deacon's house, from whence she had been twice ignominiously&#xD;
thrust forth. The Doctor said it was clearly providential, and&#xD;
pointed to nursing as her vocation; and Mary Ann came and&#xD;
hung on her neck, and whispered,&#xD;
"How good of you to come, Sonsie dear! Oh, Sonsie, you&#xD;
must stay and help me ; this is fearful ! How do you suppose&#xD;
it will end ? "&#xD;
Mrs. Williams talked loud, and tossed back her cap-strings&#xD;
and spread herself.&#xD;
"Fudge ! I don't b'lieve nothing at all about the dog's bein,&#xD;
mad1 Here 'tis winter, and as cold as Greenland.! I'll whip&#xD;
the young dog's skin well, and trundle him off to school ! "&#xD;
And as if her say so, could make it so, she went on scold-&#xD;
ing,  abusing the Doctor and Sonsie, and threatening her boy,&#xD;
till the Deacon came in breathless, his knees knocking to-&#xD;
gether. He get hold of Sonsie's hand and squeezed it, while he&#xD;
gazed with half-bewildered eyes into her good face, trying to&#xD;
draw comfort from her strength and truth, and he kept mutter-&#xD;
ig.-..&#xD;
"It's a blow, isn't it, Sonsie? The hand of the Lord is&#xD;
upon us, -as you may say, in a manner, seemingly, -- fear,&#xD;
and a pit and a snare."&#xD;
Doctor Jenkins finished his examination, and burned out&#xD;
the-wounds with caustic, and left the boy still dead with chlo.-&#xD;
roform on the -sofa ; and beckoned Sonsie out into the hall.&#xD;
"-Come here, my girl ! He put his fingers on her pulse, and&#xD;
took her chin in his hand, while he peered into her blue eyes.&#xD;
" Plucky, and steady, and quiet ! You will do your duty here,&#xD;
as you always do it;, without noise or- fuss. I wish more&#xD;
nurses like you were to be had for love or money. I fear this&#xD;
poor lad has got to- go. You must stay where you are for the&#xD;
present. I had rather you had not washed the wound, Sonsie ;&#xD;

(he shook his head) "on his naked hand, you see ! nothing to&#xD;
clean off the poison before the fangs entered the flesh. I. incline&#xD;
to the belief that there is electricity in the fatalinfluence, which re-&#xD;
quires the presence of a fluid conductor; forif a dog's teeth are&#xD;
wiped by passing through clothing, no evil effects follow, In some&#xD;
terrible manner, the spirit.of the angry beast seems to be infused&#xD;
into the victim like inoculation; and it is absolutely certain that&#xD;
the virus is resident in the saliva, because the disease has been&#xD;
communicated by the mere touch of a mad dog's tongue upon&#xD;
a healthy wound; and in cases where the sores have been healed,&#xD;
and no evil results have followed, anger will cause the old&#xD;
wounds to flush and throb in unison with the rage:of the bitten&#xD;

Three or foutdays ought to-show us where we' are.~ You seem&#xD;
to be the one to-hold tthis family together in its' troubles; so&#xD;
make haste. It may-pass over.' I've known cases, where the&#xD;
wounds healed, and months or even years elapsed before a seiz-&#xD;
ure ;I'depend°entirely upon you.- That woman has no more&#xD;
idea of nursing than a dromedary of playing the flute. Her&#xD;
daughter would be rotting in' her coffin to-day, if she had 'had&#xD;
the handling of her. There;she-goes! wiping up tracks, with&#xD;
a scowl on' her face ! I wish I had brought in a bushel of mud&#xD;
on-each boot ! The trouble and the 'dirt of -the thing, are all&#xD;
she thinks of. Maternal instinct seems' wanting. You run&#xD;
right off, Sonsie, child, -you've got your orders,  clip away,&#xD;
now !-.&#xD;
"I'll do me best, Doctor Jenkins, --I always do -!" said&#xD;
Sonsie, stoutly. "I never '-was any gret friends wid Bax Wil-&#xD;

Doctor can't you pul him through ? Sure he's the taste of a&#xD;
dirty lie yet on his tongue. Oh, cure him up, and let him git a&#xD;
chance-to behave.&#xD;
"I'd-gladly do it, Sonsie, if IPhad the say; but no cure has&#xD;

"Well, well,:Doctor! if he has to go over the dark river in a&#xD;

they'll consider the home, and the hard 'times, and the auld&#xD;
draggon of a :mother that' he had, and start him again."&#xD;
Doctor-Jenkins placed his spectacles, with a finger either&#xD;

Mrs. Williams kept about her energetic housekeeping.e She&#xD;
was making soap, and tarried near the. cauldron; testing and&#xD;

school in the morning with a halter round his lazy neck!"&#xD;
went back to his office, and tried to enjoy his, profits.&#xD;
For the next three or four.days, the boy was much the same,&#xD;
not inclined to stir. His mother talked about a whip, and his&#xD;
father hoped he only got a cold ; his breathing; was;thick and&#xD;
wheezy, and his eyes were very red; and his young nurses took&#xD;
turns in reading to him and telling hini stories. -Sonsie had&#xD;
used plenty of soap and water-about him, and he looked quite&#xD;
nice in his clean .linen, and neatly brushed .hair ; and she per-&#xD;
sisted in getting him into his Sunday clothes through much trib-&#xD;
ulation. A softening, humanizing influence. was' in the. sick-&#xD;
room, and seemed to' melt into him with the atmosphere of&#xD;
tenderness which surrounded him., His thoughts were'busy;&#xD;
and he had fearful timnes ofahorrible dread of the future, which&#xD;
it took all the moral strength of his two helpers to control.&#xD;
He manifested intense curiosity about the next life, andlistened&#xD;
attentively to the Bible amounts of the New Jerusalem  coming&#xD;

his words were inspiration; his tones, winning sweetness ; his&#xD;

One evening, after Mary Ann, had been singing to her&#xD;

hold of her hand.&#xD;
"You're a real good sister, Mary Ann," said he. " I e'en-&#xD;

$2                  "MAD DOG!".&#xD;
thetboy's flesh, - a white cicatrice surrounded by a livid band ;&#xD;
and the little finger hung powerless ; the tendon was severed,&#xD;
and small atoms of bone had worked out of the wound; but no&#xD;
fatal symptoms appeared. He had a low nervous fever ; and&#xD;
was easily excited, with spasms of trembling and wild weeping,&#xD;
after which he sobbed himself to sleep upon Sonsie's breast like&#xD;
a grieved child; and for hours together he lay with half-shut&#xD;
eyes in a sort of stupor, from which he impatiently refused to&#xD;
be roused; and he saw wild sights) of prancing horses, and packs&#xD;
of dogs, coursing free among his native hills, who looked fixedly&#xD;
at him with their still eyes ; he trapped fierce animals whose&#xD;
savage faces grew human and made him shudder, they glanced&#xD;
so vindictively upon him ; but these things, the Doctor said, might&#xD;
be a part of his fever; and he was trying a new treatment,&#xD;
which he watched narrowly.&#xD;
Fourteen days had crept by, and Bax was paler and thinner;&#xD;
he begged for water and drank eagerly, holding, clutching the&#xD;
glass in his trembling fingers. And Sonsie kept ice about his&#xD;
head, and the palms of his hands ; he lay with wide open eyes,&#xD;
which mechanically followed the floating motes, up and down,.&#xD;
up and down, and his tongue was dry and purple. He talked&#xD;
by. fits and starts, with his young nurses, of every thing he had&#xD;
done and suffered in his short life, and they comforted him.&#xD;
."Sonsie" said he, " there's a whole lot of Dorkings out in&#xD;
.My hen-house that IL-didn't ought to have. I good's stole 'em&#xD;
of Chris Gol4smith, and I want you to :take.and keep 'em for&#xD;
her." Then he told how he had become possessed of the fowls,&#xD;
and begged her to entreat Chris to forgivehis many injuries to her.&#xD;
He went laboriously over his misdeeds and laid them bare to&#xD;
her, and fastened his eyes upon hers while he asked if she really&#xD;
thought Christ would be his Saviour. Another day, he could no&#xD;
longer swallow ; and then the painful paroxysms began to come&#xD;
&#xD;
on, the raging madness ; he was. lashed to the bed, and his fear-&#xD;
ful struggles were horrible to witness, and his half-choked ani-&#xD;
mal howls were enough to blanch the cheek. Sonsie stood&#xD;
close to him, never flinching, and wiped the viscid foam from&#xD;
his purple lips, carefully burning each bit of'linen she used.&#xD;
In an interval of quiet, he whispered to herlaboring to be&#xD;
understood.                                -&#xD;
"I'm going, Sonsie. Thank good Mr. Growing. for all his&#xD;
prayers. I think I see Jesus; I think he-smiles upon one;- I've&#xD;
been a dreadful boy ; so cruel ! so wicked! .He. knows all&#xD;
about it; I've told him; but I think he'll take me home, and&#xD;
let me rest, I'm so tired - so tired ! Mr. Growing said- Jesus&#xD;
loved me-; I guess he does ; ,4:hope he does ; I'm sure he does.&#xD;
Over the river,' Sonsie, sing it please,! Come, Mary Aim, you&#xD;
sing it too. I'll be on the bank, all ready:to meet you when you&#xD;
come. I thinkyou wont be longrafter me, sister. I seem to&#xD;
know it, somehow ;. and-you'll be glad to get into the beautifttl&#xD;
city. It is all peace and sweetness thereisn't it? no quprelling&#xD;
no scolding. Where's the children ? Fetch them all with y etk.&#xD;
didn't have much comfort together here ' but we'll get it over&#xD;
there; and I'll begin to be a good brother to'your. Jesus is going&#xD;
to teach me how. Oh ! I wish I hadn't been so badtt it&#xD;
can't be helped now. .Everybody has forgiven, me -Jesus is&#xD;
smiling; his face is so sweet~ it rests me to have him looksat&#xD;
me. Dear Jesus! he moved childrendidn't he? hewas a child&#xD;
once himself; he knows all about it'&#xD;
He sank back exhausted, and closed his sunken :yes, rad&#xD;
the Doctor took Sonsie aside.&#xD;
"-The time is short now," .sai the; "you must be strong and&#xD;
quick;asave him all the suffering you re able Here is a sponge,&#xD;
and this ois chloroformn. Put it to hisa mouth, whenh beginsto&#xD;

After- a long stupor, Bax roused again, and his poor purple&#xD;

his 4ris, and Soisie and Mary Ann put each a hand into his&#xD;
burning palms.&#xD;
"Sister, will you wear black for me ?"&#xD;
"I don't know, Bax," replied she, glancing timidly at her&#xD;

"Of course .'* she spoke up, in her strident voice ; "we- all&#xD;

Before Sonsie could apply the sponge, the froth was dropping&#xD;
from his bruised tongue, and his eyes were set in the death&#xD;
agony. In an instant, he sank back motionless : his sufferings&#xD;
were over : he was gone !&#xD;

RS. DEACON WILLIAMS was fully alive to the du&#xD;
ties which devolved upon her, and dispatched then&#xD;
with bustling zeal and business promptness. She  had&#xD;
the house furbished up from top to bottom, and all the furniture&#xD;
set out at its best, and every grain of dust carefully removed.&#xD;
Even the bureau drawers and presses had to be laid over.&#xD;
"As like as not, some of em "1 be peekin' in while we're gene&#xD;
to the grave.- Old Miss Pettingill is a dreadful curus crtter.&#xD;
I heard she said she never see a house so full of good t ings&#xD;
as Miss Bradshaw's,_such piles of linning, and blankets, and&#xD;
cotton cloth, and. coverlets, and counterpins, and every dura&#xD;
thing. How'd she know, if she didn't peek into the closet an&#xD;
chists? 'Tain't no ways likely they went reound and shown&#xD;
'em to her!"&#xD;
As for the poor father, he was quite overcome, and grieved&#xD;
sorely. He andMarq Ann stayed in outofthe-way. plaes,&#xD;

prayed together. It was Mrs. Williams who sent for Mr. Plant-&#xD;
, upto take charge of the funeral, and she gave him minute&#xD;
directions.&#xD;
"A rosewood coffin, silver plated and lined with white sating."&#xD;
And she chaffered over the price and screwed him down to his&#xD;
Iowetfigures. She sent for the floral gardener, and ordered&#xD;
the bouquets and crosses.&#xD;
"You needn't spare no expense. Put in plenty of big flowers,&#xD;
 -camelias and sich ; and be sure and fix 'em strong, because I&#xD;
intend to have 'em skelatated afterwards and put into gilt&#xD;
frames. Miss Vedder had her'n done in Toptown after her hus-&#xD;
band died, and they say they're butiful -every bit as nice as&#xD;
pictures to hang onto the wall. So you may have 'em jest as&#xD;
costic as you've a mind to; they wont be lost."&#xD;
This was the dame's firstfuneral; and she meant tyanake&#xD;
tUe. inQt ofthe occasion. When anybody called, she o0k&#xD;
htdsand looked solemn, and said, -&#xD;
"We shall expect to see you to our funeral."&#xD;
Sonsie overheard Mary Ann pleading with her parent, that&#xD;
she, Sonsie, might be allowed to ride by her side in the carriage,&#xD;
and couldn't help listening for the reply.7&#xD;

herlhead up, like" Eve listening at the fougain," and she was&#xD;

"Not by no means !if anybody is let in, 'twill be Mr. Nick-&#xD;

new mournin'. frock hangs. Go right up and try on your bonnet.&#xD;
I wonder if them jets '1l be becoming to you. I think I will&#xD;
ask Mr Nickson - step along !",&#xD;
Mary Ann ran into Sonsie's arms, as she left the maternal&#xD;
presence, with her handkerchief to her eyes, who hugged her&#xD;
heartily before she let her free.&#xD;
" No   no ! mistress, don't ye be throubled," said she, as she&#xD;
stepped briskly about her work. "I'll go to the poor boy's&#xD;
buryin'; he'll be looking' for me to be there, and I'll not be the&#xD;
girl that '11 disappoint him; and he hardly settled and to hoee&#xD;
yet in his new place ; but I'll go on me own two futs, jest. He&#xD;
was a poor mistreated fellow;; andI'll say a couple of prayers,&#xD;

Captain Slocum said Mr. Plantum.had a keen nose for a&#xD;
funeral; he could smell one afar off as the "war horse suffeth&#xD;
up the battle ; and he dressed his face - in gloom and his lank&#xD;
person in black garments, afterhe had finished his arratige&#xD;
ments, - the camp chairs, the ebony table, the black -pall,he&#xD;
showy coffin, the crape for the bearers, the carriages and&#xD;

in the hall during the prayer, and wept copious l into his white&#xD;

and went home. "By the gods of -Vhala!" said he, "that&#xD;

The people in the carriages talked of the crops, and the&#xD;
weather, and the election; and the women commented upon&#xD;
the appearance of the bereaved family in their new 'Morning,&#xD;
and discussed Mrs. Williams's ma agement of her children, and&#xD;
related anecdotes of, the dead boy, which bore rather hard&#xD;
upon-her maternal tenderness.&#xD;
Mrs. Deacon Proddy and Mrs.. Mc'Cross were inthe same&#xD;

above the dead boy's heart, and stepped back as easily as she&#xD;
had approached, and was lost amongthe other people.&#xD;
Mrs. Deacon Williams said she. felt Baxter's death deeply,&#xD;
and she was extremely particular about her mourning. I never&#xD;
heard that she regretted any of the beatings she had given the&#xD;
poor lad, nor the times she had led him to school with a-halter&#xD;
around his neck.; but she told her acquaintances that he was&#xD;
the child of many prayers, and she had no doubt whatever as&#xD;
to his future state.&#xD;
I don't know as it was in the least owing to her, that the young&#xD;
Williamses had a better life, but they certainly did, for Mary&#xD;
Ann went softly and spoke kindly to them;- she gathered them&#xD;
together, and read to them, and her father watched her in&#xD;
silent' delight, and often joined himself to their company.&#xD;
Somehow they were all drifting away from the stout well-to-do&#xD;
mother, into a higher, brighter atmosphere. The poor creature&#xD;
could not see it, she was so busy with her muck-rake she felt&#xD;
no inspiring presence in her household ,&#xD;

The Deacon took good: care to carry out Baxter's wishes in&#xD;
the matter of the mourning, and Sonsie had just received a box&#xD;
full of dresses and aprons, a simple black hat and cloak, and&#xD;
a couple, of pairs pf nice gloves. She turned them over with&#xD;
pleasure, the good bombazine the strong merino, and the two&#xD;
ginghams : they were Baxter's gift, and she prized them:highly.&#xD;
She put on the bombazine and walked up and down the room,&#xD;
looking at its tr ail over her shoulder. It was the first one she&#xD;
had ever worn, and she smiled at herself as she stepped. Now&#xD;
something queer happened, which you must believe, for it is&#xD;
strictly true.&#xD;
Rainbow was lying on the lounge, with his head in his paws,&#xD;
and the third or fourth time Sonsie paraded:past him, he got&#xD;
deliberately down and joined her. Walking by her side, he&#xD;
trailed his great mottled tail on the carpet; .and-looked .at -it,&#xD;
over his shoulder, precisely as- his friend was doing her long&#xD;
robe. Sonsie watched him awhile in:silence, and then pounced&#xD;
upon him and covered him with kisses.-&#xD;
"Ah, Rainbow, me boy! did you think I was too vain?&#xD;
Well, perhaps I might be; but, you -see, I haven't worn mine&#xD;
so long as you, acoushla, dear "&#xD;
Pretty soon Jan Vedder :came in, and he could hardly take&#xD;
his eyes from the. red and white comeliness of the fresh young&#xD;
lassie.  She told him the story, and tried to: put Rainbow&#xD;
through his paces again, bit he provokingly 'refused :to "en-&#xD;
core " the scene, and lay down and frisked amongPigeon's&#xD;
nine-pins instead ; and when they were quietly seatedade&#xD;
leaped upon- Jan's shoulder, and purred vivaciously.  ' Pretty&#xD;
soon, Sonsie came, passing swiftly by'; and stroked him, and&#xD;
said, "Kiss me, Rainbow," and he put up his mouth as sensibly&#xD;
as folks, and seemed thoroughly pleased with what he gt.&#xD;

' when they fow close to each other, with only the films which&#xD;
cover lips and cheek between." Though, the sweet, wholesome&#xD;
face was so close to his, Jan did not dare to put his lips to it,&#xD;
as he might audaciously have done, without stopping to&#xD;
think, a few months before.  He had learned some lessons&#xD;
since then ; and it was but an instant and no more, before she&#xD;
had withdrawn, and sat bending over her new hat, in deep&#xD;
thought, the other side of the table.&#xD;
Jan put down the handsome Egyptian, and walked about the&#xD;
room, touching the books and Sonsie's knitting with uneasy&#xD;
fingers.. He had a proposition to make, and hardly knew how&#xD;
to form itso as to- be safe ; though he had turned it over in his&#xD;
mind so oftenthat it was all clear there as sunshine.&#xD;
" Could I see Mrs. Blair this evening, do you think, Sonsie ?"&#xD;
he asked, after a little.&#xD;
 " No, sir; she studies in her room at this hour, and I must&#xD;
notiinterrupt her, and I must be after studying' py lesson itself.&#xD;
Oh, Mr. Vedder, I get much discouraged those-times." She&#xD;
N aved a deep sigh. "Idication is like going up -a ladder:&#xD;
every step I take there's so-many long ones ahead of me. I&#xD;
think I'll never be aught but a poor,-ignorant girl at last!"&#xD;
Whae the trouble now, Sonsie? I thought you never des-&#xD;
paired ! You are certainly the ;bravest girl I know ; but you&#xD;
need help, o1 course." =&#xD;
Jan felt ,as if a :way was opening for him to introduce his&#xD;
proposition, still he .would not spoil it with hurry; so he&#xD;
added,&#xD;
"iWhat is it, Sonsie ? Perhaps I can enlighten you."&#xD;
"Just this, Mr..Vedder : Mr.Growing gave me this purty&#xD;
book" (showing him the Pantheon). "It tells all about the by-&#xD;
.gone times, when peopleworshipped Jupiter, and Mars, and&#xD;
NIeptune, and the gods of the trees and the streams (we used&#xD;
&#xD;

him what was the old religion of Ireland before the  h&#xD;
Pope, and he said it was much the same as these in&#xD;
and the priests were called Druids.; and I wanted to kn&#xD;
more, but I didn't like to ask other questions: he might think&#xD;
me troublesome."&#xD;
"I can tell you all about that, Sonsie 1" said Jan, sitting&#xD;
down enjoyingly. The crafty fellow was constantly reading up&#xD;
Ireland, so as to be posted upon the diverse points on which&#xD;
the young emerald sought information; and he had to keep&#xD;
tolerably busy, too, for she cropped out in all sorts of unex-&#xD;
pected places.&#xD;
"Ah! that's nice of you, Mr. Vedder ; let me get-me-sewing,&#xD;
till I listen."&#xD;
" I can't see the particular use of it, Sonsie;.but .they say all&#xD;
knowledge is profitable, and so perhaps this will do you, some&#xD;
good. The Milesians,-that s.the ancient, or=pagan Irish,--whose&#xD;
origin was traced back by-their=bards to Milesius; and back of&#xD;

Draoi, or Druids, and :they governed the people as well as sac..&#xD;
rificed for them. Laogare, who was -king at the time of St.&#xD;
Patrick- always swore by the sun and wind; he had a remarka.-&#xD;
ble stone, ornamented with gold, which gave oracles, -answers&#xD;
to questions, you know. Different nations have endeavored to&#xD;
find out the origin of the word Druid: the Germans think it&#xD;
comes from Dru, which means faithful; the Saxons from Dry,&#xD;
which signifies magi; the Milesians got it from Dair, which means&#xD;
oak; and I think that is the -prettiest derivation, at all events;&#xD;
for their. island abounded with towering forests of the acorn-&#xD;
bearers, in the solemn seclusion of which the Druids celebrated&#xD;
their mysteries. - They are not, by many, the only ones who&#xD;
have held- sacred the oak, .and its mistletoe. In Greece the.&#xD;
priest, dressed in white, used to climb the tree and sever, with&#xD;
a golden knife, the clinging vine, and give it to the people to&#xD;
cure their ills; 'and certainly there was one.:use they could make&#xD;
of the good strong ones which was finishing and -complete."&#xD;
"You mean hang themselves, sir.' Sorra .a bit of a cure is&#xD;
that! - Dyin' isn't the end at all! oh, no, we've all got that in.&#xD;
side of us-that teaches different."&#xD;
"Oh, well, you mustn't interrupt me with theological points&#xD;
now.- Some day we'll take up. the ' tobe or not to be' for a&#xD;
question-; but I'm going to tellkyou about the deities, -I've just&#xD;
got to lit. Bell, he-was one, a -rich god who owned land and&#xD;
had his sacred fire, a this sacrifices, and his.golden calf. . He&#xD;
was adored (says the learned Abbe McGeoghegan) till Christ&#xD;
came, and we know that the same fellow is much adored nowa-&#xD;
days, especially by the women, in the form of dollars and cents,&#xD;
diamonds, laces, and so on.&#xD;
"They used to eat each other in those . times, Sonsie ; lucky&#xD;
you didn't open those blue eyes of yours beneath some Dru-&#xD;
idical oak;! the fairest=andYprettiest. young girls were the-vie-&#xD;
&#xD;
tims ; and there is a story of a rurse, -who fed her little-princess&#xD;
on children's flesh to make her strong-and-beautiful."&#xD;
"Ah, auf! I don't believe that tale, anyhow. No true Irish&#xD;
girl would do such horrid things," said Sonsie, who had forgot..'&#xD;
ten all about her  ewing, and was listening with eager eyes and&#xD;
parted lips. - But whisper, Mr. Vedder, sir; -what ever did&#xD;
they wear those old times?"&#xD;
"True woman !t" said Jan, who was enjoying himself hugely,&#xD;
and reckoned the hours well spent which he had devoted to ac-&#xD;
quiring useful Irish knowledge. " The men went very finely&#xD;
dressed: they had a tunic, -and drawers, and leggins, and boots-all&#xD;
made of one piece of leather, and as tight as could be ; and out-&#xD;
side, a purple cloak ; their hair. and beard unshorn .swept their&#xD;
shoulders and breasts, and they had high peaked caps for their&#xD;
.heads, and on their feet sandals,-just a sole, you know, Otied&#xD;
on to their big toes and ankles with many strings. A-most admir-&#xD;
able and becoming attire, Sonsie; I'll originate it. for our next&#xD;
fancy party, and you shall. be lovely Edna, the charming spouse&#xD;
of Ollan Folda, the stubborn."&#xD;
"What might that be, sir?"&#xD;
"A very modest raiment, Sonsie ; no anklets, nor bracelets&#xD;
nor nose-jewels, nor wimples,.nor :crimping pins, nor-tablets&#xD;
but a short' mantle of cloth, to the-knee, worked and fringed&#xD;
over a petticoat; and-their fildeathor headdress a long strip of&#xD;
white linen turned spirally around their .heads, -and tied=into&#xD;
a vail behind; their -hair platted and intertwined with ribbons&#xD;
You must let your shining tresses grow- young-Edna, for our&#xD;

Jan was a little confused by this direct reference to the source .&#xD;
of his information, and had no idea of permitting her to ship in&#xD;
bulk, what it afforded him so much delight to dole out by in-&#xD;
stalnents.&#xD;
" Sonsie, the black dress you have. on becomes you rarely ;&#xD;

one of his yellow gold chains around your neck, with a little&#xD;
Paris watch in your belt, would be a nice finish, wouldn't it?&#xD;

"Yoh think so, indeed! Well, imayhap you are right, but&#xD;
I'm not a lady, only a servant at this present time ; and I shall&#xD;
keep agood watch over me behavior, Mr. Vedder,  that's all&#xD;
the watch I need for now ; thank ye kindly for your unspoken&#xD;

Jan blushed.&#xD;
"It was no unworthy thought, Sonsie;'nothing to feel shame&#xD;

and coughed slightly, before he met the eyes of the young girl,&#xD;
who dropped the work she had picked up again, and darted a&#xD;
keen look at him. He returned it without flinching; and the two&#xD;
kept silence a moment.&#xD;
"You are true and honest, this evening, Mr. Vedder, and you&#xD;
are varee good. I honor you for the kind intent: it does ye&#xD;
credit; but, ye see, it is onpossible."&#xD;
"I don't see it at all!1" replied Jan, eagerly. "That sort of&#xD;
thing is done every day.' Rich 'men choose so to spend their&#xD;
loose cash; they fit young girls to take care of themselves,&#xD;
educate them for singers, painters, sculptors, and teachers, and&#xD;
the good girls work very hard, and they earn a great deal of&#xD;
money, and they do good with it; they educate. their young&#xD;
brothers and sisters, it might be Dennie or Mystie;" and they&#xD;
take care of their old mothers. Yes, indeed!"&#xD;
" But suppose they don't succeed? supposee they die before&#xD;
the time comes ? they die in debt. I couldn't die in- debt, Mr.&#xD;
Vedder."&#xD;
"Look here, Sonsie, you've no right to go back on your own&#xD;
words, -'If you had made me the offer as a true man thathas&#xD;
money to lend might have made it to a poor girl, I'd have&#xD;
taken up with it, and blessed ye for it.' That is 'just what ou&#xD;
said, verbatim. Now I do make it, look at me ! carit you read&#xD;
the truth and honest purpose, that prompts me to beg you to&#xD;
accept a loan from me. I have it ; you need it;- let me lend it&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
" Mr. Vedder, I was wrong to speak those words I didn't&#xD;
know it then, I know it 'now; and you must leave asking me; it&#xD;
is onpossible."&#xD;
Sonsie ! what an unpleasant girl you are ! so stubborn, so&#xD;
unreasonable 1 I should think anybody as sharp as you, could see&#xD;
the force of a strong argumeit better. If I was an old gray.&#xD;

beard, you would not be so silly.  I wish I was as hideous ac&#xD;
the clauricawn, who mends his brogues day and night, under the&#xD;
shadow of the cow-thistle, with a: purse of gold in his pocket;&#xD;
then perhaps you would listen to reason, and act for your own&#xD;
good."&#xD;
&amp;amp;1 don't,: then, Mr. Vedder ; I shouldn't take the pleasure I&#xD;
get now, in looking at your bonnie face, like a gleam of God's&#xD;
blessing;"&#xD;
Jan started, and put out his hand to grasp her's; but sank&#xD;
back again, as she said, with modest, bold firmness in her blue&#xD;
honest eyes, -&#xD;
"I don't see me way clear, sir, to any such idication; and&#xD;
till I do IJ can't step safely. -Yer just wastin' yer breath," and&#xD;
she shook her head half sorrowfully as he opened his mouth to&#xD;
begin again. "''Tis no use talkin', sir ; ye may drop it, or we&#xD;
will be bad friends for stare."&#xD;
You might learn a little music, at any rate, Sonsie, -the Irish&#xD;
harp, for instance ! In old times the Milesians excelled upon&#xD;
that, ' they struck harmoniously the .strings of brass, with their&#xD;
fingersin sweet, quick accord; they drew melody from discord-&#xD;
ance.'- Wont yott have .a harp, Sonsie ?  You might venture&#xD;
that mtich in my debt. I think I'd wait till you'd earned the,&#xD;
ihoney, travellingyou know, and playing beneath the people's&#xD;
windows," said Jan, teazingly. Poor fellow ! he was much- pro-&#xD;
yoked, and out of patience, with the small ground he made.&#xD;
"Thank you, sir ." she replied, in unruffled good temper; "I&#xD;
travelled wid a broom when I was a slip of a girleen, barefoot&#xD;
and :often hungry. I know more about -that life than a gentle-&#xD;
man who slept in down and dined famously those times, could&#xD;
river be tellin' me. I'd that sort of travellin' enough to do me&#xD;
for a lifetime.&#xD;

rose ; tossed back the spools he.had been building tottling&#xD;
towers with, into her work-basket, and stood before her with his&#xD;
chest out and his head up, and his cheek and eyes fired by sud-&#xD;
den emotion. 4"'I'd keep the purse and carry the pack, and you&#xD;
should sing your wild Irish songs, and twang the harp-strings.&#xD;
I could tell you some tales of a life by the hedges under-.the&#xD;
ripe sunshine, careless and free, which would bring the violet&#xD;
into your eyes, till you should feel these Yankee trammels,&#xD;
chains intolerable and you'd long for the wood-quest singing in&#xD;
the sweet meadows, and such freedom as the Bohemians of the&#xD;
world enjoy. I wish I could cut loose and live that way with you,&#xD;
Sonsie. I'd willingly leave society behind me."&#xD;
Sonsie sprang up, and not too soon either ; for the young fel-&#xD;
low was fast surrendering himself to a dream of love which shut&#xD;
out reality, and responsibility, and stern duty, and knew only her&#xD;
for its source of joy.&#xD;
Sonsie felt indignant at his folly; but beneath her indignation&#xD;
there was the faint tremble of an emotion which quickened her-&#xD;
pulses and kindled in her face. It was not love, -only the&#xD;
glimpse of a possibility ; it just fluttered and vanished before&#xD;
Jan had time to catch its glow, -Jan who was a little ash  ield&#xD;
of himself for deviating from the plan of action he had ni  R&#xD;
out; and she lifted her blue eyes, clear, positive, and confidelt.&#xD;
"And will ye be gone now, Mr. Vedder?" asked she, as Jan&#xD;
picked up his hat. "Well, good-evening, then, sir; I'll e'er&#xD;
forget yer kindness."&#xD;
Yes, onsie, I'm going down to the bank to talk up gold&#xD;
stock ; or; no, I believe I'll go and have a game of chess and a&#xD;
bit. of German with Mr. Growing. I need some solace for my&#xD;
disgusting disappointment."&#xD;
He smiled as usual, at her, as he shook her hand: "Plbring&#xD;

He looked teazingly merry, and so fresh and frank and kigd,&#xD;
that the young girl felt thoroughly proud of him.&#xD;
"He's a raal gentleman !" thought she. "I'm glad I spoke to&#xD;

A BOTTLE OF HARMONY SHERRY, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.&#xD;
SQUIRE HITCHCOCK and Mr. John Nickson had a&#xD;
long talk over a bottle of Harmony Sherry, and finished&#xD;
the wine while just in the interest of the conversation.&#xD;
So they breached 'another bottle, and before it was emptied, the&#xD;
Esquire had bought some of the "Sprightly,"' stock, -which he&#xD;
had a perfect right to do if he felt a call to make a fool of himself;&#xD;
but he also let. out a secret, as his tongue got loose, -- a confi-&#xD;
denceinttusted to his keeping which should have been as sacred&#xD;
as . penitent's revelations at the confessional; and Mr. John&#xD;
Nickson knew as much as he did abontt Deacon Williams's will.&#xD;

* Casta Diva's, and display of housewifely acconiplishments,---&#xD;
all her energy and zeal in the, Mission School.&#xD;
Mr. Nickson had been some while saying to himself,&#xD;
"How happy could I be with either,&#xD;
Were the other dear charmer away,"&#xD;
and using his wits to discover which of the young damsels was&#xD;
"most heavily-weighted;" or, as he was oftener accustomed to&#xD;
put it, which of the two old daddies would cut up fattest. The&#xD;
young Williamses outnumbered the juvenile Hitchcgcks; but&#xD;
the Deacon's Gonecusset shares trebled those of the Esquire, and&#xD;
he had, plenty of means beside; therefore he went oyertha&#xD;
same evening and ivited Mary Ann Williams to drive wit him;&#xD;
and her mother being present, she had no choice but to accept,&#xD;
and now the poor girl was going to be married to him. The&#xD;
wedding-dresses were made, and the cards out;. theywere&#xD;
big as a pocket-dictionary. Six of them, -the "at church," the&#xD;
"at home," the Deacon and the Deaconess's names conjointl&#xD;
the bridegroom and the bride's separately, and the monthly recep&#xD;
tion day. And in the corner of the "at home," were thelet-&#xD;
ters R. S. V. P. in gilt and azure. Old Miss Pettingillaskedjaf&#xD;
Vedder what that meant, and he explained that it stood for re-&#xD;
spectable society, victuals provided," and appealed soberly to&#xD;
Mrs. Williams to confirm his statement, and she said with real&#xD;
gravity, equalling his assumed seriousness,&#xD;
"Oh, no, indeed, I guess not; I asked the clerk,ad hetold&#xD;
me how 'twas, 'Rings, silver vases, pianers , to. ive to&#xD;
the bride';' but folks don't need to confine themselves tg them&#xD;
things, if they don't want to,,, you know; they can pay their&#xD;
,money and take their choice, of course."&#xD;

her recent bereavement had not n the least softened. Baxter,&#xD;
her eldest son, was dead and turned to dust; she had done her&#xD;
duty faithfully by him, and given him an expensive funeral. Old&#xD;
Miss Pettingill said " it was such a beautiful hurrying that it was&#xD;
a real pleasure to contemplate upon it, and it seemed a most a&#xD;
pity he couldn't a been there himself to see how nice every&#xD;
thing wentof'."  Now Mary Ann her eldest daughter-was going&#xD;
to be married and she rose equal to the occasion. It was her&#xD;
first wedg and 'she determined to have it gorgeous and com-&#xD;
plete.&#xD;
'Thebridegroom-elect also held opinions upon the proper&#xD;
style of his nuptials. He purchased a showy mansion, a little&#xD;
way up Gonecuset street, upon which he put so many kinds of&#xD;
ornamentation, that the architecture became truly" composite,"&#xD;
and outshone the "two steeples and a doom," which. Captain.&#xD;
Slocum said he'd got upon his house. One corner was a Chi-&#xD;
nese pagoda; one, a Gothic chapel; a third, a tower with a&#xD;
roof so high and steep, that Captain Slocum' asked the banker&#xD;
if he "ownedeall'theway' up " 'andin th  centre italian&#xD;

villa. And over the great gate to his sumptuous barn (which&#xD;
edifice a couple of Druse missionaries, home, begging for money&#xD;
to build a chapel on Mount Lebanon, mistook for a church, it&#xD;
was so imposing and solid), he caused to be erected wooden&#xD;
figures of a fox and a pig. Miss Pettingill remarked of them,&#xD;
"Law, sakes ! what drefful peculiar creatures to stick up&#xD;
onto that Nickson's fence ! Masseyine ! how folks can. But&#xD;
I suppose, mebby they're family statutes."&#xD;
The banker furnished his house superbly; sending to Toptown&#xD;
for upholsterers, and other cunning artificers, and superintend-&#xD;
ing the whole in detail.&#xD;
Adeliza Euphemia went over it the day before the wedding,&#xD;
and said "the pictures wasn't much," and the carpets "would&#xD;
sweep off;" and spoke against the bedsteads, groundlessl for&#xD;
every thing waelaborately elegant. You might almost-have&#xD;
taken the Deaconess and the banker for the lovers, thsre&#xD;
so chatty and familiar together. Poor Mary Ann was}d&#xD;
upon nothing. She was not even permitted to have her dear&#xD;
pastor and friend, Mr. Growing, to perform the ceremony,&#xD;
the Rev. Dr. Perfect, being fetched from Nansook Junction&#xD;
again, to officiate.. Indeed the Growings were not invited to the&#xD;
"at home ; " a slight, it was intended, they should deeply feel.&#xD;
The girl begged with tears to be allowed .to take her first com-&#xD;
munion before she became a wife; she felt as if- it would .om-&#xD;
fort her, and give her strength for her- future. *But she was&#xD;
positively refused by her mother, who had a private planabout&#xD;
that, she was waiting an opportunity to..carry out.. There was&#xD;
a paper in circulation, asking Mr. Growing to resign;- and as in&#xD;
Congregational churches the sister's vote she and  Mrs.&#xD;
Hitchcock had been very busy, and she looked to have Mary&#xD;
Ann come out under the management of the Rev. Dr, who&#xD;
was known to lead off such ceremoies ini dramatic style. And&#xD;

so poor Mary Ann, who never had her say nor her way in her&#xD;
life, was going' to be' married-by a stranger whom she disliked,&#xD;
to a husband she was afraid of.  Married, with ostentatious&#xD;
display, while her'-heart was 'still'sore with her brother's recent&#xD;
horrible death. 'Her mourning was to be put aside, and she&#xD;
decked out in 'bridal finery, and to take her place by side of the&#xD;
banker, a centre figure in the costly show.&#xD;

Knox stuck to his pious friend-and bled him deeply sometimes.&#xD;
The lorig parlor, at32 Gonecusset Street,'was gorgeous with&#xD;

a cunning wreathing 'gf ground pine, and alittle portable altar&#xD;

room afterwards, full of shame and sorrow. Mrs. Williams had&#xD;
wished a hundred times, during her preparations, that she had&#xD;
Belle Brandon to help her.&#xD;
"She is drefful tastey," she said, " and such. a team to work&#xD;
when she's a mind to put in!" and -Mary Ann trembled lest&#xD;
that beautiful blonde should be invited to assist at her wedding.&#xD;
The black cake was baked and frosted ;and the bride's loaf,&#xD;
which was ordered from Toptown, had arrived. The bride,&#xD;
dressed in her costly satin, loaded with orange-flowers, was&#xD;
waiting in her chamber with Sonsie for her only companion.&#xD;
Her . face was chalky white, and her eyes hopeless. The&#xD;
good stun walk" was covered with Brussels carpet ; an&#xD;
there  ere two bands'in' attendance, one outside to discourse&#xD;
music M the passers by,-as the fellows in gilt-lace sit before-a&#xD;
circus tent, -and the other, up stairs in the hall, between the&#xD;
two "nic for stat," which Mrs. Williams found in the architect's&#xD;
plan of their residence ; and mentioned to her friends with&#xD;
pompous accent. The "stat " were a minus quantity, and the&#xD;
" nic " were filled with a couple of " Praying Sammys " backed&#xD;
by peacock's feathers.&#xD;
The gay bridegroom came dashing up to the door in his new&#xD;
carriage,&#xD;
"Like a railroad train, with a queen inside,&#xD;
With directors to poke, and directors to guide."&#xD;
Sonsie, who was talking against time to make Mary Ann smile,&#xD;
announced the fact characteristically ; and when he put his&#xD;
head into the door, shortly after, there came also a strong odor&#xD;
of spirituous liquors ; and his eyes were a trifle watery as well as&#xD;
blood-shot, and the like-ss to an old baked apple stronger than&#xD;
ever about his heavy jaws. hut his dress was perfection, and&#xD;
his manner - Well, the less said of that the better. Sonsie&#xD;
knew very well how to take care of herself, though she could&#xD;

bear his close approach, without shuddering, if she' could ; and&#xD;
his breath ! augh!&#xD;
After he was gone, she put her hands on Songe shoulders&#xD;
and gazed into her face, seeking hope, and begged with dumb&#xD;
lips for help ; till the good, honest girl's eyes filled with tears,&#xD;
and she had hard work to force the needful smile..&#xD;
Dame Williams hustled in, adjusted her cap before the mir-&#xD;
ror, and dabbed her blazing face with' the powder puff.-&#xD;
"There's one fool come," said she.&#xD;
"Yes, mam, -he's just been up here," repliedSonsie.&#xD;
"What do you mean ? You had strict orders not to let. no-&#xD;

" But, mother, I've got to pull off my glove, you know; so&#xD;
that I can't possibly wear it so," answered Mary Ann, who&#xD;
dared not add that she hated the sight of the bauble anywhere..&#xD;
"Well, well tyou needn't put the glove on, 'tinerate,, after&#xD;
the ceremonyy"&#xD;
The. house was full of guests. Old Miss Pettingill care&#xD;
eaxly, and was comfortably swaying back and forth in her rock-&#xD;
ing chair,. with the regularity of the shutje, while she wove the&#xD;
woof of her 'conversation.&#xD;
" Law ! " said she, " how' drefful numerous that young Brown&#xD;

Mr._ Hauxhurst, with Susie Jenkins on his arm, edged in&#xD;

as he espied Mary McCross.&#xD;
"Ah, Miss Mary ! " said he ; "'We met, 'twas in a crowd,~and&#xD;
I thought that you would shun me.' I wonder if you have still&#xD;
identity enough left to be able to say, 'Who is my neighbor ?' "&#xD;
"I hope so, though we certainly are 'pressed to remain,'&#xD;
like a box of Smyrna figs."&#xD;
"Yes, really," replied Cabby, who was making up Miss Mc-&#xD;
Cross, "quite a crush ! I feel like a slice off Mr. Jones welded&#xD;

"Why, don't you see she's robed in sea-green. 'Tis'quite a&#xD;

Mrs. Deacon Proddy and Mrs, McCross stood close to the&#xD;

Deacon Williamsfollowed his daughter uy'to her room, after&#xD;
the parade was over; he wiped his eyes, and sat down, and&#xD;
tookjher on his knee. He hadn't enjoyed himself much; once-&#xD;
or twice he had endeavored to assist in entertaining the guests,&#xD;
and had been snubbed and set aside by his better-half, and he&#xD;
looked chap-fallen and out of spirits; and when he questioned&#xD;

But even while she talked hopefully to her downcast parent,,&#xD;
she dreaded the future of that two doors off; and a dim un-&#xD;
certainty floated through her mind as to how far she would be&#xD;
permitted to enjoy her friends' society. But her trust in Christ&#xD;
coforted her, and. she strengthened her resolution to do all the&#xD;
duties sheC  f ud, mnd leave the event where her interests were&#xD;
safe ; and hand in hand they descended.&#xD;

The bridegroom had disappeared from the festal scene for a&#xD;
short space, and returned in overcoat and wraps, with redder&#xD;
eyes and thicker utterance. He rather stumbled, than other-&#xD;
wise, against his new papa-in-law, and clasped him in his arms.&#xD;
 "'Oh, Romeo !'" exclaimed he, in touching accents, and a-&#xD;
something approaching an interjective hitch in histh&#xD;
"'Oh, Romeo ! wherefore are art thou Romeo?' I     d&#xD;
Stick-in-the-mud, what do you mean by such conduct:  e?&#xD;
Why is this thus?"&#xD;
And he went on spouting bits of plays in jovial accen, and&#xD;
showed an inclination to elevate his voice in song, aid }was with&#xD;
difficulty detached from his embraced support ; and then Mary&#xD;
Ann came and hung on her father's neck and kissed him.&#xD;
"Good-by, pa,".she whispered ; "you've been proper good&#xD;
to me; ever so much better than I deserved. I want you to&#xD;
go and see Mr. Growing, and tell him we couldn't help it, and&#xD;
give him our dear love ; wont you, dear, good, kind pa ? And&#xD;
-take care and not get sick till I come back to you."&#xD;
And then she was shut into-the carriage with her husband.&#xD;
When Lord and Lady Byron were shut.in, in like manner,&#xD;
we are informed that the noble lord announced to his bride.that&#xD;
she had "married a wretch,M- a devil." Poor Mary Ann Nick-&#xD;

Mrs. Williams called the ushers together,-Jan, and Cabby,&#xD;

guage, and told them she considered them " extremely offi&#xD;

AN VEDDER took his loving young mother into his&#xD;
confidence on a certain subject. She cried a little at&#xD;
ngfirsand was unhappy. She wa,s a thoroughbred-lady&#xD;
herself, and it seemed to her simply impossible that Jan could&#xD;
staffer hi'thbghts to restupn a servant;' underbred, common !&#xD;
'thacdvered the whole ground. Peter refused to eat, when&#xD;

any comn oruncleal 'element.' He got a good 'lesson on&#xD;

with God to help them.&#xD;
"Why, mother 'I believe, on my honor as a gentleman, that&#xD;
Sonsie Eagan saved me from a drunkard's grave!,'&#xD;
Th!e little lady, "sitting in. her crinsonicushioned chair;&#xD;
dressed in spotless' silk with dainty finish of} laces 'and jewels,&#xD;
looked up at her boy, andi saw-how hearty and fresh-his face&#xD;
was, and-how strong and' purposeful:l1e looked. She=knew she&#xD;
had cried herself to sleep many nights : and lived through days&#xD;
of pining anxiety for the safety. of this 'her only son,- her&#xD;
"precious darling!" and. she rose and threw her arms around&#xD;
him, and wept onshisfneck, and .bad ethim "Godespeed" with&#xD;
her blessing.;.and resolved to :take up-bravely her 'part, which&#xD;
was, to try to make the most she could out of theIdaughteri Jan&#xD;
was thoroughly determined to give her.&#xD;
Jan had already tried many choice arguments to induce Son-&#xD;
&#xD;
sie to visit his mother in his company; but she firmly de-&#xD;
clined.&#xD;
"There's no occasion, sir," -said she. "Your mother is a&#xD;
lady, and I can afford her no pleasure; ,and I will not be in-&#xD;
truding meself upon her."&#xD;
"That is not 'a proper light in which to view the the subject;"&#xD;
argued Jan. "Of course, you wouldn't take a step to please&#xD;
me; I know that very well. But there are many thingstabdt&#xD;
the place that would be useful to you. The great library is full&#xD;
of books. You might select what you like ; -there's a history of&#xD;
Ireland, in ten-volumes, full of pictures, and fairy=stories,°and&#xD;

"Couldn't ye be fetchhig it wid ye-some of those evenings,&#xD;
Mr. Vedder?" asked Sonsie, laughing.  And is it good&#xD;
stories, all about the Kelpie Queen, and The little hill'folk; and&#xD;
the cauricawn, and the -elves'-gloves, and Puck the Brownie'?&#xD;
You had a' right 'to bring it over, 'Mr. Vedder, or else keep&#xD;
silence about it."&#xD;
"No, Sonsie, 'I'll not bring it you'! If'you will come in my&#xD;
company 'and pay my' mother a visit, and see my home, and all&#xD;
the beautiful things 'I have to show you; I shall think you are&#xD;
a good, sweet, kind' girl; and we'll have a pleasant walk to-&#xD;
gether, and 'fetch back theabook to the Horseshoe, but not&#xD;
else."_ .  ,'&#xD;
"Well, then, Mr. Vedder, they must even bide where they&#xD;
be; for I11 not go!'&#xD;
Mr's.,Vedder' had-never 'visited 'Ruth Blair before her sorrow,&#xD;

for it. I urged and argued my best ; and I got plain ' no' for&#xD;
my answer. She'll get her education, though; she is, getting it.&#xD;
every day. Mrs. Blair says her progress is like a miracle. Oh&#xD;
yes, she'll get it : and she'll work herself to death ; she'll be a&#xD;
broken-down, faded teacher after a while, in spite of me. And&#xD;
I have the money she needs, and the love she don't want;- you&#xD;
see, mother, money isn't of any value ! I believe I'll go to&#xD;
China or Hindostan or the South'pole 1"       .-.&#xD;
"What plan of useful life does she propose to you,my boy?"&#xD;
asked Mrs. Vedder, who could not bear the notion of Jan, leav-&#xD;
ing her and becoming a rover again.&#xD;
" A mission school and chapel, just now. She works there,&#xD;
heart and soul, mother; it would do. you good to see how those&#xD;
rough boys respect and obey her. The fact is, I, don't believe,&#xD;
Sonsie Eagan will ever get married. She is so full of doing&#xD;
good to the many, I doubt if she will ever bring herself to&#xD;
love the one ; and if she does, a reformed-drunkard will not be&#xD;
the man !&#xD;
"Don't speak in that way of yourself, Jan, my dear; I do not&#xD;
like to hear you" said Mrs. Vedder, laying her hand upon her&#xD;
son's arm. "So this wonderful girl wishes you to build a&#xD;
chapel, does she ? What will it cost'?"'&#xD;
" Six hundred dollars or so ; I suppose, there's a lot of lumber,&#xD;
and odds and ends of stuft left over from our- church that I&#xD;
could buy. cheap."&#xD;
"'Take a thousand, Jan, and buy a lot, and commence: direct-&#xD;

them, since they first came over, - but plenty of gentlemen&#xD;
and ladies.&#xD;
Jan took up his mother's small, jeweled hand and kissed it.&#xD;
"EDear little aristocrat !" said he, "you fear that your demo-&#xD;
cratic boy will- bring taint to your pure blood. Ah.! you don't&#xD;
know Sonsie Eagan ! Nature made her a lady."&#xD;
"Well, Jan, bring the lady to me ; let me see and judge foi&#xD;
myself. Tell her the price of the chapel is a visit to Brook-&#xD;
edge, and leave the rest to me."&#xD;
"%Why, mother ! she'll never. come ! It will be of no use ;&#xD;
she'll laugh at me. She's got. the merriest blue eyes, mother !&#xD;
and the prettiest cherry mouth, and such dimples in her cheeks!&#xD;
you never saw the like !  She'll tell me to go and do my duty&#xD;
like a man; and leave her time to do, hers. She always sets&#xD;
her hands on her hips, and looks at me over her shoulder when&#xD;
she-is suspicious or excited."&#xD;
'"True Irish fashion," thought the mother ; but she said,''She&#xD;
will come, Jan, if she is the good, earnest girl, you think her."&#xD;
"Well, mother, I'll try once more, -;".Jan, shook his head,&#xD;
-_ "but I'r-afraid 'tis useless."&#xD;
That very afternoon, Jan called at the Horseshoe, where he&#xD;
11  always had the entree, and found Sonsie just at the tail-end of&#xD;
the week's ironing (she would do all the work of the house.&#xD;
Ruth was not. permitted to wet her'fingers ; teaching, ,being in&#xD;
Sonsie's opinion, sufficiently exhausting, with the care of Pigeon&#xD;
and the sewing), and her. hands were always busy, her head&#xD;
I    clear and cool, and her lessons never-failing. She often got&#xD;
help fromJan; when Ruth was shutinto her room, or out for&#xD;
the d    alk, she compelled herself to take, with her boy for&#xD;
companion. Her boy! who was daily growing more like his&#xD;
fatherland who was so rosy and healthy. and happyfull of tricks&#xD;
and pranks and sportive mischief.-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"But 'mid w his dafin', sic kindness he shows,&#xD;
He's as dear to her heart as.the dew on the rose."&#xD;
In truth, Ruth scarcely knew how much' Pigeon helped to&#xD;
keep her heart alive, ahd her courage up.  "I have him to love&#xD;
me, whatever comes," she said sometimes; "and he'll be a good&#xD;
true man after a While. I must take such care of myself that he;&#xD;
will he 'feel no shame in looking at his mother. Ruth was a dar.&#xD;
ling bud of a woman,- when she thus glanced "adown the vale&#xD;
of time" to Pigeon's manhood; and so good and judicious a&#xD;
mother as deserved every thing from the child to the man.&#xD;
She gave him his father's name, but not at the baptismal&#xD;
font. On that fateful day when she questioned her soul in the&#xD;
sudden stillness of her newloss, and learned that she was alone,&#xD;
she perceived that her child's face was wet with tears, which&#xD;
had dropped from her own eyes; and she signed the cross upon&#xD;
its forehead,' and in those holy drops which welled'up ffom her&#xD;
breaking heart, she christened him George, "in name of the un-&#xD;
divided trinity." *  She was a good Protestant, but in her weary&#xD;
trouble Christ was her nearest friend, her best helper; aaid she&#xD;
thought it rno sin to consecrate her darling by the sign of his&#xD;
Holy suffering,&#xD;
Ruth liked Jan, and believed in him sincerely; her own griefs&#xD;
had not closed her heart to outside good; and she took=the&#xD;
liveliest interest in Sonsie and the greatest-care of her; planning&#xD;
for her, 'teaching and helping her, so that every day: was a step&#xD;
up the ladder; 'and we know how ardently the young Irish las-&#xD;
sie enacted the part of the little mouse to her dear friend and&#xD;
mistress, as she would call her.&#xD;
"Can you' walk with me this afternoon; Sensie'?" asked Jan.&#xD;
"I want your advice.   have nearly made up my mind to set&#xD;
our chapel'inoperation, and 'you must help me  elet the site.'&#xD;
* This beautiful idea isborrowed from that rare writer, F. W. Shelton.&#xD;

Sonsie looked into her basket.,. " A walk, sir ! I don't know&#xD;
about that. I've a deal to finish yet, but I'll work me best.&#xD;
Why, Mr. Vedder, sir, what ails your cheek ?"&#xD;
Sonsie pointed her finger at a purple promontory on the young&#xD;
man's face, angry and swollen,-one of those beauties which gave&#xD;
such zest and variety to the experience of good old Job.&#xD;
"I'm trying to cut a swell," he replied, passing his hand gin-&#xD;
gerly across the spot,&#xD;
"To cut a swell, is it, sir ! then why don't ye send for Dr.&#xD;
Jenkins sure, he'll cut it for yer, as neat as a cat licks her ear."&#xD;
"Never mind your jokes, Sonsie. I was not in safety, neither&#xD;
had I rest, neither was I quiet ; yet trouble came. Tell me&#xD;
you'll come out with me. My mother enters warmly into our&#xD;
chapel plan, and promises to furnish it for us."&#xD;
" Now I call that. nice of yer mother ! and you are really&#xD;
going to do a good thing at last. I'm more gladder then I can&#xD;
tell you!"&#xD;
" Say 'gladder,' or 'more glad,' Sonsie, if you please ; 'more&#xD;
gladdet' is bad English."&#xD;
It is good Irish, then, sir ; but I thank you for taking the&#xD;
trouble to improve me language, and I'll try hard to remem-&#xD;
ber. I'll go out with you. ,I said 'with,' sir. She smiled&#xD;
archly. "Did ye mind that, now!"&#xD;
" Yes; Sonsie, I see .you are Irish clear through."&#xD;
"Yes, troth and I am; descended from Milesius and Japhet ;&#xD;
shall I tell you the rest of it while I am smoothing the linen,&#xD;
or will you help me with, me English history?"&#xD;
Jan took up the book and read aloud the lesson, and ex~&#xD;
plained and enlarged it with knowledge of his own, and descrip-&#xD;
tions of the scenery he had travelled-over (much of it on foot&#xD;
in the most Bohemian fashion, -knapsack on hisback and oak&#xD;
&#xD;
1             SI&#xD;
&#xD;
stick in hand); and by the time the clothes were all on the horse&#xD;
the lesson was finished, and Sonsie thanked him warmly.&#xD;
"I'll just run and freshen up myself a bit," said she, "and&#xD;
be ready."&#xD;
Jan looked at her and thought she was as fresh as a rose al-&#xD;
ready, and sat still thinking over her piquant utterances, and&#xD;
sharp crisp ways, till she came down hooded in green, and well&#xD;
wrapped in peach-meat. Jan would have given her no end of&#xD;
dresses if he had dared, but her sturdy independence, was al-&#xD;
ways in his way, and he never;ventured to offer her so much&#xD;
as a pair of gloves. She was tidy and presentable always, and not&#xD;
wanting either in little finishing articles, -collars, cuffs, and rib-&#xD;
..                                          .-&#xD;
bons; and as for shoes ! no princess ever went in trimmer guise.&#xD;
I'm afraid Sonsie was a little proud of her foot ; at any rate, she&#xD;
always trod with a light step, and airy. And she could keep a&#xD;
brisk pace for miles, without showing fatigue; her cheeks would&#xD;
flush crimson, and her eyes laugh in merry light, while she tossed&#xD;
off her oddities, answering the teazing, Jan loved to engage her&#xD;
in.. And her breath came evenly from her expanded chest, and&#xD;
her good lungs felt no uneasiness. She never told how she&#xD;
furnished herself with what she needed, -clear-starching, fluting&#xD;
and knitting, - nor how she sewed odd times ; all that she con-&#xD;
sidered her own affair. She would accept nothing from Ruth&#xD;
except board and education; and- those she meant honestly to&#xD;
earn. Mary Ann Williams, Mrs. Nickson now, was permitted&#xD;
to contribute a little sometimes ; but she had been useful to&#xD;
Mary Ann, and the poor timid woman leaned on the strong girl's&#xD;
strength.&#xD;
They walked steadily and enjoyingly on through the glen&#xD;
and over Hogsback, and came down around the pinnacle, and&#xD;
by common impulse they paused before an enclosure, - akpas-&#xD;
ture lot of four ior five acres, bordered on oneside by Roaring&#xD;

River, overlooked:by the pinnacle, and backed by gentle hills,&#xD;
among whose pretty dells and wooded shelters lay the village&#xD;
dead. Two or -three sheep, some half grown calves, and the&#xD;
cow ponies, were feeding there, nibbling the hay, rubbing about&#xD;
the stack and sunning themselves by its side.&#xD;
"Captain Slocum's meadows," said Jan.&#xD;
"A sweet, purty, quiet place, Mr. Vedder," replied Sonsie,&#xD;
richly rolling her "r's"&#xD;
"'Pretty,' Sonsie ; do try to say 'pretty.' I wish you could&#xD;
remember."&#xD;
Sonsie,'nothing discomposed, pronounced the word again and,&#xD;
again, but it would twirl in her utterance in spite of all her care&#xD;
as it always did when she was pleased or excited.&#xD;
"-Indade, Mr. Vedder, ye never spake a truer word than that&#xD;
just now, I'm Irish lane through.".&#xD;
"I;daresay Captain Slocum would sell this piece," said Jan,&#xD;
after looking at her a moment. . How would you like it for our&#xD;
mission"&#xD;
"I think it will be.just splendid, sir."&#xD;
"Very well, Sonsie; before I move an inch in it, I'll make a&#xD;
bargain with you."&#xD;
"A bargain, sir!" Sonsie's head was up, and her suspicions&#xD;
alert directly.&#xD;
"aYes, Sonsie, a compact ; so much for so much ; a premise&#xD;
to pay for value received; you must consent to go and make&#xD;
my bother a visit."&#xD;
".That's vey square of you, sir! Mayhap you've forgotten our&#xD;
interestin' conversation on that same subject. I don't at all see&#xD;
S    the connection.; I think I gave you your answer that time."&#xD;
"Answer is the -Latin. for goose, and you're one," said Jan,&#xD;
pettishly. " If I tried to remember all the silly hing you say,&#xD;
I should have my head so full of nonsense, that it would quite&#xD;

&#xD;
drive out my education ; and where would your Irish history be&#xD;
then? By the way, I was looking into that large one in the&#xD;
library this morning; it's from the time of Japhet till now, and&#xD;
full of pictures, and the whole life of St. Patrick,,and a full&#xD;
length engraving of him, with his foot' on a - snake, and the&#xD;
martyrdom of St. Eliph, son of the king, who gave up vast&#xD;
possessions, being persuaded that it was delightful to serve God&#xD;
in poverty. That would just suit you, Sonsie."&#xD;
" Mr. Vedder, what is the Latin for 'teaze'?" asked Sonsie,&#xD;
with a laugh in her eyes.&#xD;
"Well, Ollan Folda the stubborn, the whole thing lies&#xD;
packed in a nut-shell, -no visit, no chapel. I have as good a&#xD;
right to my whims as you to yours; and if you ask me to spend&#xD;
my time and money for a wish of yours, the least you can do is&#xD;
to comply gracefully with any little proper request I feel in-&#xD;
clined to make; at any rate, I wont move a finger tillyou&#xD;
gratify me 'in this. - It will be a useful lesson-to you; teach you&#xD;
to respect the wishes of others, which you haven't thusfar&#xD;
learned to do, as you ought ; and it is but a trifle after all."&#xD;
"An' is it a thrifle-that ye deem it, sir, for me to put meseif&#xD;
out of me station and forget; the hole of the pit from :whence I&#xD;
was rigged, and go visiting to a lady, like yer mother, and let&#xD;
her take notice of me poor English, and  I be hurted at it? No,&#xD;
no ! Mr. Vedder; wait a couple of years, till I've me 'idication."&#xD;
"But my mother wishes to see you, Sonsie; she has often&#xD;
heard me speak about you and she bid me askyou to come;&#xD;
she was much moved by the;ready presence of mind and agile&#xD;
action you, used to save those poor little children. Rainbow&#xD;
took a fansy:to: my other the first time he followed-me home,.&#xD;
and he lies.in her cushion, nearly'every day.- She is, not a very&#xD;

"She's comfortable lookin', sir, and nothing fearsome. I've&#xD;
seen her often riding her purty mare, and looking out of her&#xD;
carriage window, and I've stopped to look at her, too, working&#xD;
among her-flowers ; she's fashioned from different pottery than&#xD;
me. I'm sorry ye make such a coil about this visit, sir ; I don't&#xD;

" There is, Sonsie ! I'm sure there is," replied Jan, eagerly ;&#xD;
"she'll tell you all about it."-&#xD;
Sonsie fixed her eyes upon the 'young fellow, and read him&#xD;
through and through.  "It's true for ye, Sonsie Eagan ; the pair,&#xD;
of them have talked ye over. This gentleman is getting it into&#xD;
his head that he will like to marry wid the Ulster weaver's&#xD;
daughter-; and the. mother will have me to coom and be' looked&#xD;

path, she need. not be a bit worried. I'll mate with a clean-.&#xD;
skinned O'Rouke, plase God. It would kill me entirely to be&#xD;
looked down upon. I'll never be helping meself to such a lot..&#xD;
No, no ! Mr. Vedder, sir ; yer very kind I'm sure, and I hope&#xD;
yer quite reformed; indeed I truly believe ye are ; but I've no&#xD;
call to be loving' any one just now, and Ithink a handsome'&#xD;
young Irish lad with a wise head 'on his shoulders, stuffed full&#xD;
of idication ; and his blue eyes, merry wid divilment, would&#xD;
just please me better nor any Dutch Yankee at all, when I&#xD;
make upi me mind to double nieself. FIl go. and see - the lady&#xD;
in course, sir. -She makes this coil about it, and she'll aisy see&#xD;
there's nothing the least to fear."'&#xD;
To -Jan's surprise, she said, with her eyes full-of fun, and one&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
of the bright, wide-awake looks into his face, both fearless and&#xD;
modest, which he liked so much,&#xD;
" I'll go right away with you, Mr. Vedder, since you and&#xD;
your mother are .so kind as to step down and invite me up.&#xD;
Indade if that is the hinge, I'll be turning on it directly, and&#xD;
the poor boys shall not be kept out of their fine chapel by me.&#xD;
Right glad will Dennie be, sir ; he's boot-black at the Millville&#xD;
House ; my biggest brother, and a brave lad he is ; we've the&#xD;
rest of the children to home along of the babby.  There's a&#xD;
deal of Eagans, sir, and as poor as poor can be. I'm not able&#xD;
to speak much about them in the old country, but* all of us&#xD;
here, is hewers of wood and drawers of water. Dennie and me,&#xD;
we used to sweep the crossings ; and you couldn't believe how&#xD;
hungry we used to get those times."&#xD;
She watched him curiously as she talked; he did not ine&#xD;
at her plain statements, but said regretfully,---&#xD;
" Don't tell me so, poor child ! I cannot bear to.hear it. I&#xD;
was throwing away money by handfuls, and trying to get rid of&#xD;
myself as well; you did not catch me up one minute too soon."&#xD;
Sonsie flushed all over, and tears sprang to  her eyes. "Oh&#xD;
sir, what a good noble life you are able to lead with your money&#xD;
and your manhood !"&#xD;
Jan glanced quickly at her : he was always hoping for some-&#xD;
thing when she spoke like that ; and was alw ys getting disap-&#xD;
pointed. She was not looking at him, but her swimming eye's&#xD;
were fixed upon the gray 'sky beyond, and her bosom swelled&#xD;
with the thoughts she had no words for. He sighed and forced&#xD;
down the utterance which trembled on his lips.  "You come&#xD;
and help me, Sonsie ; be my guide as you are my saviour"&#xD;
She wasso self-reliant, so independent, and put herself sofar&#xD;
away from him in every thought ; she showed so unconsciously,&#xD;
but so plainly, that she was engrossed with workingout her plans&#xD;

strong, straightforward, and honest ; and her way lay so remote&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
ZOE WALSINGHAM ENGAGES A " MAID."&#xD;
E'old Vedder' estate down on the flats, and on both&#xD;
sides of Roaring River, comprised hundreds and hun-&#xD;
dreds of acres, and was' farmed by many tenants.&#xD;
Vast orchards piled -up their fruit; cranberry marshes, which&#xD;
were a fortune in 'themselves.  The wood-lots, which 'were&#xD;
forests of giant trees ; the hbp-yards and tobacco fields ; and&#xD;
young Jan, who loved Sonsie Eagan, and was the only son of&#xD;
his mother, was heir to them 'all. --The estate had been under&#xD;
the care of Cousin'Vedder, as he was called, who superintended&#xD;
the whole, and invested the proceeds. Jan's wants were al-&#xD;
*ays munificently supplied, and every thing looked prosperous&#xD;
and 'correct.  Of late the -young man had 'been thoughtfully&#xD;
watching Peter Bradshaw and turning over matters in his mind ;&#xD;
and now-that his twenty-first birthday had passed, he fully de-&#xD;
termined to try his' hand at' managing his own' affairs ' -e&#xD;
spoke about it to his mother, who expressed the fullest'faith in&#xD;
his capacity 'and rejoicel inthe hope of keeping him near her.&#xD;
H -alsotalked it'over with Peter, who was enthusiastic in sup.&#xD;

He had often seen Jan walking with the Ulster maiden, and&#xD;
thought his own thoughts on the subject; but would not speak&#xD;
them unless it was necessary, and very glad was he to find him&#xD;
true and manly beyond his suspicions. But such a marriage !&#xD;
he shook his head,-and  ade up his mind to confide in Zoe ;&#xD;
fully expecting she would. turn up her nose in scorn, and despise&#xD;
Jan for low-mindedness. There's no telling:what a woman will&#xD;
do in-such cases,and Peter opened his eyes wide in astonish..&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"WhatI send her to school and marry her afterwards ! Oh,&#xD;
Peter, how tice and romantic ! and so noble of Jan ! So few&#xD;
men can see virtues under poverty. I declare I must shake&#xD;
hands with him, and thank him in the name of the sex;,and I&#xD;
should like to help him. She's good: and pretty, too. I was&#xD;
looking at her,last Sunday, in Mission School. She talked&#xD;
earnestly; and her cheeks were-like roses; and really, Peter,&#xD;
she has a lady's hand and foot (Zoe glanced, at her own little&#xD;
slipper). You may tell Jan from-me that I highly approve his&#xD;
plan"&#xD;
«You haven t forgotten that she is a- servant, Zoe; like&#xD;
Bridget, your housemaid ?"&#xD;
"She's quite different, silly Peter ! Bridget is not in the least&#xD;
pretty. You're a nice Democrat, aren't you? Didn't we1have&#xD;
a President who was a tailor, and who couldn't read till his wife&#xD;
taught him? Let everybody find their level, I say. I mean to&#xD;
go right away and see Sonsie, and encourage her."&#xD;
"Well, Zoe, you are a trump ! I am ratherglad, though, that&#xD;
you ,are a boti lady ; I have no fancy for 'moulding a wife ;'&#xD;
but I like Jan, and I hope-he hasn't made a mistake. He is a&#xD;
thoroughly whole-hearted fellow, and has gota will, too. He&#xD;
persists in sticking up-for Kerry.cows; because they're Irish,&#xD;
perhaps. Yo know, Beecher says, 'dirt is'so good for people&#xD;
&#xD;
2oztWHASZANGMtM AAGAcS          M     y    iOr&#xD;
that God rolls them in'it every third or fourth generation ;and&#xD;
we can't any of us go back too far and not-°stumble upon&#xD;
something queer. I know there was a Bradshaw hung-in Bos.&#xD;
ton in colonial times, for stealing a sheep."&#xD;
"That's nothing remarkable.  Those old Puritans rather&#xD;
liked hanging people as a pastime; it agreed  ith their consti-&#xD;
tutions."&#xD;
"But the best of this affair is, Zoe, that Jan is afraid.Sonsie&#xD;
Eagan wont have him. He has made no progress at all thus&#xD;
far."&#xD;
" That's because she's proud, Peter.; afraid of being looked&#xD;
down upon ; as she gets on, and grows sure of herself, she'll feel&#xD;
different. But, Peter, I as good as knew all this before; I've&#xD;
been observing Sonsie a-good while. You know,We found her&#xD;
long ago, down to the old school-house ; and Chris and we&#xD;
gave her her first start. I'll take hold in right earnest now;&#xD;
I'll go this evening, and I'll let her understand that I'm her&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
Sturdy Peter pondered this answer some time, and renewed&#xD;
his conviction that whatever Sonsie Eagan might be, Zoe Wal-&#xD;
singham was certainly the most wonderful girl in the world:&#xD;
Fired with ardor, -Zoe dressed, in her complete, deliately&#xD;
elegant fashion, andpresented herself at the Horseshoe. The&#xD;
door was-opened by Sonsie; ho had on a clean checked apron,&#xD;
and held a knife, and a half-pared apple inther hand; and&#xD;
though she paused in her merry lilt, the niirthoef it til janced&#xD;
in her 'eyes.&#xD;
"How do you do, Sonsie ?" said Zoe, offering her' gloved-fn-&#xD;
gers. "Im glad to fnd you at home"&#xD;
"Thanks, Miss. Walsingham; but Irs. Blair is out for her&#xD;

" You, look- tired, mavourneen !" said she, in a cheery, ca-&#xD;

"No, Sonsie, I cannot ; I came for you to drive with me&#xD;

Sonsie laughed as she shut the door upon her visitor. "The&#xD;
dickens is in all these gentlefolks, I think," said she; "they're&#xD;
determined I shall know their mothers."&#xD;
Zoe went home mortified and discouraged, and wondering.&#xD;
at her ill success. She had seen Sonsie frolic with Pauline and&#xD;
Gracie, and had heard her talk with Mary McCross, on mission-&#xD;
subjects, as one friend talks. with another, and give opinions,&#xD;
and suggest plans, which were solid and valuable. But, though&#xD;
discouraged, she had no idea of giving up ; and after an evening&#xD;
with Peter, she went again to the Horseshoe, and made - the&#xD;
Ulster maiden an offer.&#xD;
"We are going in a party to New York, Sonsie, to purchase&#xD;
the wedding things, and I want you with us to help. I shall be&#xD;
so busy and. full of shopping; and there are heaps of affairs&#xD;
which require attention; and if you'll say 'yes,' I shall take it&#xD;
as a real favor. In fact, I must have you! I can't be married&#xD;
satisfactorily to myself unless you will."&#xD;
"And is it to be yer maid, Miss Zoe ?" asked Sonsie, with&#xD;
her head up. "Ye'd be a gay little mistress, anyhow."&#xD;
" You can pat it that way, of course, if you like, Sonsie: I&#xD;
should rather you would say ' companion,' and should like you&#xD;
to saY 'friend,' if such a strong, useful person as you could feel&#xD;
friendships for a May-iy, like me. But I'm 'going to be good&#xD;
now; I must have you by some title, and I'll pay you any thing&#xD;
you please, foi your double and loss of time.  Jr minutes&#xD;
are so precious, you make them tell; and indeed it'shall not&#xD;
be my fault if you don't enjoy the trip. We'll see all the places&#xD;
of interest; all the picture galleries,"and those, and I thin the&#xD;
days so spent would be quite as educating as any you could get&#xD;
&#xD;

in -Roaring -River ; and, Sonsie, you shall go shopping, and&#xD;
help me buy my dresses and shawls and every thing !"&#xD;
"And the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and&#xD;
the bonnets, and the ornaments for the legs, and the head-&#xD;
bands," said Sonsie laughing. "Oh yes, Miss Zoe, it would be&#xD;
rare indeed; and will Miss Chris be of your party? You said&#xD;
'we,' Ithink."&#xD;
" No, Sonsie, not that I know of; but Sabrina and her mother&#xD;
are going, and Peter, has asked- Mrs. Vedder -a-n-d perhaps&#xD;
Jan also."&#xD;
"Oh 1" replied Sonsie. Then after a moment she answered,&#xD;
"I'll go, Miss Zoe,- if me mistress gives me leave; and I'll serve&#xD;
you faithfully."&#xD;
Sonsie's feelings were curiously mingled, as she questioned&#xD;
with herself aftera"Zoe departed. "Aid is" it',a-step 'upward&#xD;
that yer takin', 'Sonsie, me lass, from Miss Ruthie's kitchen, into&#xD;
Zoe Walsingham's service? but 1111 go anyhow, I think; -and&#xD;
I'l buy that dun cow for my mother ; she's just fretting' for to&#xD;
have the wee creature; and I'll get the shirts for Dennie,' and&#xD;
there's that mite of a Christie 'Malone,-'he shall have a stout&#xD;
coat that'll fit him, and- that'll be a'white day for the-dirty Vega -&#xD;
bond ; and T11 make Mystie come and stop'in dfy place-till I&#xD;
get back ; and I'll see a' bit of the world, with me two good&#xD;
eyes ; and I'll go over the old street, where Dennie andnme&#xD;
starved, wid the cold and: hunger those nights; and I'll' show&#xD;
Miss Zoe and the rest, that I khow who I am-entirely."&#xD;
Ruthwarmly approved;. and though nothing had been said&#xD;
to her about the school scheme, she thought her own 'tiouightsi&#xD;
as to Jan's fondness 'for her young friend's society; and while&#xD;
she carefully observed,,she felt no call to interfere. Sonsie was&#xD;
so proud and-right-rminded, and Jan so out-spoken and istraight-&#xD;
forward. For some unexplained reason, the Celtic lassie failed&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
SONSIE NAMES THE COLT "OLLAM FOLDA."&#xD;
ND now the Irish lassie had promised to pay a visit to&#xD;
Jan's mother. The mansion was 'steep-roofed, many&#xD;
chimneyed, ample and commodious. It was set down&#xD;
in the middle of a garden, full of old-fashioned flowers. The.&#xD;
great-grandfather Jan, had been ajealous tulip-fancier; and he&#xD;
went back to fHolland on purpose to fetch away choice bulbs,&#xD;
and at one time he thought himself very near to producing the&#xD;
much coveted black specimen, which should be priceless, and&#xD;
make his;name famous. Jan, the grandfather, had thought less&#xD;
of tulips, and more of prosperity, and money-bags, and papa&#xD;
Janhad followed in his footsteps ; so that the number of bulbs&#xD;
which had come down to our Jan, was comparatively small,&#xD;
but enough still remained to afford his pretty youthful little&#xD;
mother occupation and delight ; with her Alderneys and colts,&#xD;
and black pigs (who were -descended in a right line from the&#xD;
fierce wild boars, which used to furnish such rare sport to the&#xD;
old huntg barons,' and were as sleek and handsome as&#xD;
tigers, and who lived in architectural pens, and got washed&#xD;
every week-- the very aristocracy of pigdom), her Guinea fowls&#xD;
and musk ducks, white turkeys, and so on ; to say n thing of&#xD;
song-birds and parrots. It was one of those wondro s spring&#xD;
times, for our climate, when March comes to us like a dream&#xD;
of Arcadia; instead of the sour, sloppy, biting, uncanny month&#xD;
we know best ; when we plant peas on the first, and eat aspar-&#xD;
agus from our sun-visited beds, on the fifteenth ; and crocus are&#xD;
all abloom beneathour windows; and grass is springing in our&#xD;
meadows, and the fen-cricket tunnels his hidden ways, in the&#xD;
&#xD;
fallow pieces ; and the sheep cuddle their young lambs around&#xD;
the straw-ricks.&#xD;
"Mighty ugly little wretches they are, too," said Sonsie, to&#xD;
Jan, on this very walk; "I could niver see the potry of a long-&#xD;
legged rough coat like yon, who staggers about and says 'baa.'&#xD;
Now the illigent spry little pigeen ! he's got nimblenessand&#xD;
frisk ; he's both cunning and comely."&#xD;
"'Tis true, Sonsie," replied Jan; "but the squealing pig is&#xD;
father to the hog, who gets clumsy and bad-smelling all too&#xD;
soon."&#xD;
Sonsie hurried up her work, and put on her black dress,&#xD;
modest hat, and her new gloves ; and she stepped briskly off&#xD;
by the side of the -heir' of Brookedge,who was in high good&#xD;
humor, and full of teazing quips, and merry personalities.&#xD;
"Are you in trim for a good walk to day, Ollaa Forda ?"&#xD;
said he ; "you mustn't look tired when we reach home.; what&#xD;
little comeliness you have, it is proper to make the most of?.-&#xD;
" Tired sir ! I niver felt the feel of it ; I could walk clear to&#xD;
Limerick this day, and niver get a sob of weary=breath for zne&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
"Very well; we'll pay a visit to the up-pasture first, then.&#xD;
I've a sick colt there. I bought him of Peter Bradshaw ,Yhe&#xD;
said he was spoiled for life; I.know better; Peter shuts tip his&#xD;
horses too much, and feeds.too high."&#xD;
" Mr. Bradshaw has the name of being a famous farmer, sir.&#xD;
I should think he knew the best course to take with his stock."&#xD;
"So do I, Sonsie. I am as wise in horseflesh, as the two&#xD;
Peters rolled into one-; only I'm modest."&#xD;
"Oh, here's Rainbow ! Come, then, mavourneen delish I he&#xD;
might tell us a deal of what he sees in this round. world, Mr.&#xD;
Vedder, and what comments he makes tipon itfallI; but he's&#xD;

" Very well, Sonsie, I will agree to hand it over to the colt,&#xD;

"You must cure him first, sir ; there's plenty of time to talk&#xD;
when he gets four' legs to stand on.'&#xD;
" That's easy done, you unbeliever. I. have a peck of. bark,&#xD;
steeping in the barn now in twelve quarts :f spring:watr ;-and&#xD;

in his praise. They are as'sweet-tempered and' trusty as he&#xD;
is. Horses are full of love and also of.revenge. Tey never&#xD;
forget . an abuse, and theyoftenrevenge their injuries. Harsh&#xD;
language, used to a .high-bred horse in his stable, will cause&#xD;
his pulse to rise many beats in a minute."&#xD;
"Poor creatures! Mr. Vedder, and 'tis plenty of beats that&#xD;
some of 'em gets inside and out ;',and I hear the folks sayin'&#xD;
that Mr. Nickson's watch-eye is a great horse ; he axes '-big&#xD;

Patience."&#xD;
" He can't be suh a guy,: Sonsie,' if he is a deacon. Why,&#xD;

sob and ciy after their playfellows when they're out of sight.&#xD;
I'm sure yours should be gentle and generous, Mr. Vedder."&#xD;
"I don't keep any donkeys, Sonsie."&#xD;
" Indeed, I meant your horses and cows, and all that belongs&#xD;
to you."_&#xD;
Sonsie burst into a merry laugh, and pointed with her finger.&#xD;
"The dumb animals know their friends, sir. Is not yon an&#xD;
odd sight, now? Rainbow has got his ride before any of us."&#xD;
The- deft Egyptian was perched upon the pretty colt's arch-&#xD;
ing neek, and comfortably purring'between his fine-pointed&#xD;
ears, greatly to. the satisfaction, as it seemed, ofboth parties.&#xD;
"That cat is a gay fellow  He is on friendly terms with&#xD;
everybody except the widow. = Look, Sonsie, how do you like&#xD;
this placed? there's about thirty acres in it. That's the house&#xD;
you see down yonder, with the old-fashioned porch in front, and&#xD;
the tall well sweep.  This is the only hill I've got on my prop-&#xD;
erty; and -that gulley below, is -where I found my handsome&#xD;
Mandrake, dying."&#xD;
"'Twas a wicked deed, sir," replied Sonsie, growing sober on&#xD;
the instant, "but the poor lad was main sorry for it after.&#xD;
wards "&#xD;
"1was not thinking of Bax, Sonsie. I bear no malice, I&#xD;
assure you. - But let your blue eyes glance around you, and tell&#xD;
me what you think. - I am going to send- off my tenant this&#xD;
spring, and Peter advises me to farm the place myself. I have&#xD;
my: own views on that score, though- Those great stacks of&#xD;
poles, are for the hops we raise-here."&#xD;
. F Oh, yes, sir, I know it well. Pauline and Gracie brought&#xD;
me down here one time, and Il-dressed their hats with the purty&#xD;
wreaths,like to a picture I saw in a book at Miss Ruthie's ; you&#xD;
can't tell how lovely they looked. I think 'tis a sweet purty&#xD;

place, itself, sir. I should suppose the tenant would dool to&#xD;
leave it."&#xD;
"He is not the 'noblest work of God, Sonsie, -an honest&#xD;
man, or I should not dismiss him."&#xD;
"And what will ye do with it then, Mr. Vedder?"&#xD;
"I shall make it missionary ground, Sonsie.&#xD;
The Ulster maiden looked -at him, and could not account&#xD;
for the triumph which sat on his flushed face, and they bade -the&#xD;
colt "good-by,'' and walked on together. Mrs. Vedder received&#xD;
them ip a great room, oak-pannelled, and the walls painted in&#xD;
landscapes of boar-hunts and African scenes, palm-trees and&#xD;
elephants, and whole4ungles full of lions and tigers. The pain-&#xD;
ter came over from Holland, on purpose to immortalize himself,&#xD;
on these walls, though unfortunately, his name is lost to us. The&#xD;
carved mantel arrived also in the ship, as well as tie porcelain&#xD;
tiles, which were four deep around the great fireplace ; also the&#xD;
odd jugs, and China monsters on the high shelf, almost out of&#xD;
reach ; also the cuckoo-clock on the wall, and the oaken beau-&#xD;
fets in the corners, heaped and piled with old painted china and&#xD;
solid silver.&#xD;
Sonsie-took in the whole in one sweeping glance, even while&#xD;
she-was answering the kind talk of the small lady, who-stood&#xD;
like a beneficent fairy in the centre of the room, and stretched&#xD;
out her jewelled hand, and gave her visitor cordial greeting.&#xD;
So petite was she, that - she was forced to look up at the -well.-&#xD;
grown lassie ; and she looked in pleased surprise. ; - Evidently,&#xD;
she had not expected so much beauty. Her fancy had fur-&#xD;
nished her with a picture of a coarsish, rather red-fingered&#xD;
young woman, with thick waist, and- heavy shoulders, -who had&#xD;
somehow got a place in her boy's heart ;- and she smiled most&#xD;
glad approval into the well-opened, honest eyes, that met hers&#xD;
so frankly, and she placed her in a chair close to her own,&#xD;

" Mamrna' -mamma-! why don't the men propose ?" in-&#xD;
quired a shrill voice behind Sonsie, which made her start. The&#xD;
tone of the questiontsignified such utter disgust with the dilato-&#xD;
riness of the "m as uline-persuasion," that she could hardly&#xD;

and 'tis thruefor ye, Mr. Jan, they're a deal pottier than Ollam.&#xD;
Folda up yon," said Sonsie, laughing. The youngster explained&#xD;
to his mother's inquiring look, that they had come down. from&#xD;
the up-pasture, and that the Ulster maiden had named his new&#xD;
colt, and promised to ride him when he was cured.&#xD;
"Not precisely just, I think, Mr. Vedder," corrected she.&#xD;
" Mr. Jan asks me to do a many. things which I can't see my&#xD;
way clear to, ma'am. :He's a very troublesome young gentle.&#xD;
man to a poor girl sometimes, through being over kind; but&#xD;
there's no harm in him."&#xD;
Jan was thoroughly vexed with this careless set-down; and&#xD;
walked away without a word; and after they were left alone,&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder set herself to find out the color of Sonsie's&#xD;
thoughts.  Woman's wit against woman's wit. The Celt with&#xD;
her early gotten, sharp -intuition of motives and character&#xD;
would have been an overmatch for the little lady, if she had&#xD;
had any thing to conceal, or pny plot to mature ; but she had&#xD;
come on purpose to talk, and set her hostess at ease; alid she&#xD;
spoke very freely, and very nModestly, about herself, her family,&#xD;
and her future plans.&#xD;
U've a swate hope 'to go back to Ireland, and be a teacher!&#xD;
I seem to remember quite well the green valley and the spring-&#xD;
ing porn, and the little shealing; and the poor barefoot boys to&#xD;
homeend I should think eself happy to carry ideation on&#xD;
me tongue, and work in me hand,3to them. I'm dreamin'&#xD;
abott it oft and oft, and I believe I shall be let somehow to&#xD;
have'me wish."&#xD;
" Oh, you will be falling in love, and getting married before&#xD;
long, my child; and then= where'll be all your fine schemes?"&#xD;
"I-don't think that'likelynia'am. What I've seen of mar-&#xD;

say what I might do if a nice tidy young Irish boy should come&#xD;
along and ask me.?&#xD;
Jan; who could. not-stay long away, came back just in time&#xD;
for this confUssion of faith, and he looked soy abjebtly misera-&#xD;
ble, that his mother pitied him, though all such- talk wenC for&#xD;
nothing in her estimation where her Jan was concerned; and&#xD;
she told him Ito take;-Sonsie tothe library, and show her the&#xD;
books. He took down the History of Ireland, in ten volumes,&#xD;
but all his pleasure in it was spoiled by her last speech. Sonsie&#xD;
readily accepted the invitation to stop to. supper, and acquitted&#xD;
herself beautifully. She was so observing, and so quick-witted,&#xD;
that it was very difficult to take her at disadvantage. Though&#xD;
there were many pieces ofold-fashioned silver on the table,&#xD;
of which she only guessed the use, and some odd Dutch viands,&#xD;
and queer cakes and pickles, she looked as much :at home as&#xD;
though she had taken the like for dinner and supper fregently,&#xD;
and was modest and attentive, and thoroughly charmed with her&#xD;
fairy hostess, and readily promised to'repeat her visit, leading&#xD;
the precise period of time of ther- next cotinng indefinite.. rs.&#xD;
Vedder ordered out her "creams," and took the young people&#xD;
to the Hotseshoe; and all the way :back to Brookedge, after&#xD;
taking leave of Sonsie, she talked about hergt happy Jan, who&#xD;
declared that he'd certainly got the best mother that ever a boy&#xD;
'had. She warmly approved his choice, and promised hin hip,&#xD;
and was so :eager and delighted-that the young fellow could&#xD;
not resist taking her in his arms when the carriage stopped; And&#xD;
he carried her all about the roons, before he finally deposited&#xD;
her on the sofa;' full of plans to get rid of the brogue,' and get&#xD;
on the 'necessary'polish, though, "She's a natal, gaceful&#xD;

purpose, -"Mrs. Vedder, I'll be glad and pleased to go, if you&#xD;
will let me introjuice you to me mother."&#xD;
"I've just come from her, Sonsie," replied the matron, easily.&#xD;
"I carried her a basket .of primroses and iris to plant out in&#xD;
her patch; and a nice clump of yellow and purple crocus all&#xD;
abloom. My Jan took them up so deftly for me in their mould,&#xD;
that they won't ever suspect that we've meddled with them, and&#xD;
you will be surprised at their beauty. Our spring is so early&#xD;
this year, a month ahead of last; this is only the first of March,&#xD;
and-my bulbs are all up. I had a rare frolic with the baby'&#xD;
called -Briefne. I love babies, Sonsie ; I mean to make a gay*&#xD;
grandmother. What ever possessed you to give such a queer&#xD;
name to that youngling, dear?"&#xD;
It  is rather queer, - ,suppose, to you Yankees, but not to&#xD;
me, who've been used to hear it always. It is the country of the&#xD;
old O'Roukes to home. Me mother was an O'Rouke, ma'am,&#xD;
of:lster. We 'call baby =Brenny,' for short; she's a purty little&#xD;
bit; I think.. They say she grows very like me those titles.&#xD;
I'll be afther sending Brenny to school one day -when I've&#xD;
earned ,the nioney."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Sonsie, a capital plan; we'll discuss it as we ride.&#xD;
You're going to let me talk verx plainly to you, I know; you&#xD;
like e, don't: you ?"&#xD;
"ndade, ma'am, ye may well say that wid yer pretty mouth;&#xD;
ye're lovely to look at: such eyes ! as blue as the flax.flower, and&#xD;
fine skin as white as a waxen lily, and soft hair like sunshine ;&#xD;
you're a.winsome lady.- It makes me heart dance to see you."&#xD;
f'Thank you, my dear," .replied the small matron, who took&#xD;
very easily Sonsie's rather particular enumeration of her&#xD;
charms. "I was reckoned quite a beauty when I was a girl like&#xD;
you. They say my Jan is his, mother's boy in face ; though he&#xD;

"Mr. Jan 'I1 bear looking up to, Mrs.'Vedder. Indeed I've&#xD;
a vast respect for him meself."&#xD;
" He'll be getting a 'wife pose, after a while, my dear."&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder watched the&#xD;
"Ohyes, in toutie11 I&#xD;

A fresh, rosy, good-tempered, bright girl, who will love niy Jar&#xD;

She closed with a peculiar smile, which called up the crimson&#xD;
carnation into Sonsie's cheeks."&#xD;
" Will you excuse me 'for minute, ma'an,'while I fetch me&#xD;
hat. I'll not be kapeing ye'longer. Yer colts is prancing and:&#xD;

They drove to Captain Slocum's meadow, and got out of the&#xD;

give tp her life to her new friend. But the&#xD;
all was: with hot tears raining down her cheeks, and&#xD;
her new friend's hand to her lips, she replied, ----&#xD;
"But the debt, ma'am !  Sure I couldn't see my way clear&#xD;
at all. I'll fare on wid Miss Ruthie, till I can keep a little,&#xD;
school ; and then I'll go half the year, and pay my own way.&#xD;
I am young and strong ; don't think me ungrateful.  Don't I&#xD;
wish ye could see me naked heart, how it thanks you- such&#xD;
goodness to a shp of a wild Insh girl! but 'tis possible, just&#xD;

Well, Sonsie, we'll put it differently then, and nicer. Come&#xD;
and be my good daughter, and let me have the right of adop-&#xD;

your presence in my house, your fresh face at my table, your&#xD;
company in my drives, your daughter-love everywhere."&#xD;
"And is it a sister to Mr. Jan that ye'd be makin' of me,&#xD;
ma'am?" asked Sonsie. Her eyes twinkled through her tears&#xD;
with a modest, bold look, half arch, half saucy, and wholly pro.&#xD;
poking; and Mrs. Vedder was covered with confusion by the&#xD;
directness of the question.-&#xD;
" My Jan is a fine fellow, Sonsie Eagan," said she, eva-&#xD;
sively. "You might hunt the world over, and not find a bet.&#xD;
ter brother. -&#xD;
&#xD;
"He's a broth of a gentleman, intirely, ma'am, indeed; and,&#xD;
by the same token, yer the very sweetest lady-mother that I&#xD;
iver looked upon. If the two of us had opened our eyes in the&#xD;
same nest, I'd love your boy dear, and be main proud of him&#xD;
but you see 'twas far otherwise. Mr. Jan was cradled on fine&#xD;
linen, and Sonsie Eagan crawled over the mud floor of an Irish&#xD;
shealing. The O' Roukes was good blood in the olden times ;&#xD;
had lands: me papa was an Ulster weaver, and a very hand-&#xD;
some man, I remember him too. But whisper, Mrs. Vedder :&#xD;
they've a little wanderer up there at Deacon Proddy's from the&#xD;
home for the friendless, and I hear 'em callin' her a 'gutter-&#xD;
snipe'  I could niver bear that indeed ; there's the soil and&#xD;
mud of the streets on me garments yet, and I can scarce shut&#xD;
me eyes but I see little Sonsie Eagan, a wee bit of a dirty lassie,&#xD;
wid a big broom in her fist, wandering up and down ; lookin'&#xD;
into folk's faces for a gleam of God's charity. I must' get up&#xD;
out of that!1 so far up, that I can forget how it felt, and me&#xD;
pride won't all the while be hurted wid every chance word. I&#xD;
must work me way up; tarry by meself. Nobody- shall iver&#xD;
say that -Mrs. Vedder picked up a 'gutter-snipe' out of a low&#xD;
place, and is trying to make a lady of her. I couldn't stand it,&#xD;
and me walkin' by your side, and ridin' in yer carriage, to see&#xD;
folks point wid :the finger, nor look wid the eye. I'd know&#xD;
what their thoughts were, even if they ne'er gave- them breath.&#xD;
I'll-.plase God - make a true, pure woman out-of the stuff&#xD;
he's put into me; and what respect I get from folks, I'll earn,&#xD;
and hold up me head. Im coming on rarely. Miss Ruthie is&#xD;
kind, and me lessons is thriving; and I'll be able to teach me&#xD;
little school in a year's time, she says."&#xD;
"But Sonsie - my dear girl -"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am, I know what ye'd be after saying . I'll pray;on&#xD;

"A bracelet spun from mountain mists, a silvery sash unwound,"&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
WOMEN MAY LOVE, AND NEVER MARRY.&#xD;
HRISTABEL .GOLDSMITH was sitting in the li-&#xD;
brary; where she had been so happy and so very&#xD;
wretched, where Otho Groenyeldt 'had been so hea.&#xD;
venly kind; and were he had turned' his back upon her, and&#xD;
refusedher offered hand; where she had:left the sweet prom-&#xD;
ise of her life,. one sad evening,:when' she had shrunk away from&#xD;
all eyes, in her unsightly robes, and taken up her lot, commun-&#xD;
ing with her ownheart= iithe. stillness of her apartment.. This&#xD;
library had been to her a ;penance-chamber. She: had~ forced&#xD;
herself to tcore gftenand sit in the same corner, and ' had long&#xD;
ago settled with her soul in how much she hadi erred, and in&#xD;
what measure she had been sinned'against;. .and she ,never fal-&#xD;
tered in-;her resolution, nor wavered in -her 'determination to&#xD;
uproot the one unwomanly blemish-weed in. her character.&#xD;
The wood fire burned brightly; .and Bertha Groenveldt- knelt&#xD;
before her friend with hei arms around her waist, and her eyes&#xD;
were fixed., upon the browii, ones which looked beyond her, into&#xD;
the glowing coals. Chris was talking and the'other maid was&#xD;
listening,.&#xD;
"And did they not marry ?" asked she, when the rich voice&#xD;
was hushed, and the speaker sankback into absorbed.silence.&#xD;

somehow, after a certain point, the current of their lives would&#xD;
run strange ; and so I had to be content."&#xD;
"Brt she loved him truly, and, very dearly, did she not ?"&#xD;
ed Bertha, hiding her face.  Chris paled a little, and&#xD;
{ened her clasp of the hand which had sought hers.&#xD;
You and I know, good sister Bertha, that women may love,&#xD;
and never marry."&#xD;
"It is not a nice world at all, Chris. It gets drearier every&#xD;
day, I think."&#xD;
'"Not so, my sister. It is a beautiful world - full of good&#xD;
gifts, full of work ; we can be very happy. I believe t$y best&#xD;
women live in it alone; at any rate imean to have a   h ife;&#xD;
-and have, it to{myself; a life of freedom and art and charity;&#xD;
as.soon.as I .am of age, I shall go abroad; it was my papa's&#xD;
plan for me, and I will follow it out - as far as I am able."&#xD;
"But" - persisted Bertha -half asham ed to speak her&#xD;
thought -."but if only it could have been different."&#xD;
S"There's no use in any such idle whining -it wasn't differ]&#xD;
ent; and now the part for us to ,take,:is to get the most and&#xD;
:best- out. of what:is."&#xD;
Chris pushed her friend away from her, and rose purpose-&#xD;
fully. ,."Come," said ,she, "let's to work : that is happiness&#xD;
enough' for this evening."-&#xD;
"[No !'"answered Bertha;, "I will not work any more to day.&#xD;
'My eyes are tired, and my heart is heavy; I can't go on all&#xD;
the while, and never stop, as you do, -you who never.want&#xD;
rest; I have to creep off and be quiet, and. think, and then I&#xD;
can get stupid, and go to sleep. That is good and restful.&#xD;
Come, Chris, you shall sing to me.".&#xD;
She took up a guitar which lay on the sofa, and running her&#xD;
(Mgers over its chords,'"she changed her intention of giving it&#xD;
&#xD;
WOMEN MA Y LOVE, AND NEVER 'MARRY. 223&#xD;
to her friend, and began chanting a sort of recitative in plain-&#xD;
tive measure.&#xD;
"'I am sick, ,end sad, and weary,&#xD;
And I long to go to sleep&#xD;
Where the hectic wind-flowers blossom,&#xD;
Where the trailing mosses creep.&#xD;
Cross-crowned spruces in a cluster&#xD;
Point to heaven beyond the sky,&#xD;
But the grave is dark and lonely,-&#xD;
All things lovely fade and die.&#xD;
Meadow-lilies in the sunshine,&#xD;
Stately stand with quiet grace;&#xD;
Iris, daily life renewing,&#xD;
Shadows in the brook, her face&#xD;
But stillaround, from morn till even,&#xD;
Mourns the same sad requiem cry,&#xD;
Still the grave is dark and lonely,-&#xD;
Allthings lovely, ade and die."'&#xD;
"Nay, Bertha, do not bring out that dreary ditty          of mine&#xD;
to confound me; let us find something more cheersome, said&#xD;
Chris, gently taking the instrument.      "I wish you would for-&#xD;
get that foolish rhyme     'tis an unhealthy bit' of nonsense, and&#xD;
I'm  sorry it is so often on your lips.      Come, I'll give you a&#xD;
heroic ballad in merry measure."&#xD;
While she tunes the old Spanish guitar, the very same upon&#xD;
which Otho gave her lessons, let us look at her a little.      She is&#xD;
dressed in soft rosy gray, of clinging stuff, and rather peculiar&#xD;
cut; and at her throat and wrists, are little fluted mullruffles;&#xD;
and her hair hangs in heavy curls below her slender waist, kept&#xD;
in place by a narrow gray ribbon; and a clump of snow-bels at&#xD;
her throat, and the like, picturesquely dropped among her tress-&#xD;
es.  Chrs    was not dressed without         hyr flower, but there&#xD;
were no pansies now ; those, for thoughts, were far too sad;&#xD;
and she took such as the dear old Professor brought her daily.&#xD;
Sometimes they were musk roses, and sometimes Provence'buds,&#xD;

and again still jessamines; or daphne odora, which she got but&#xD;
rarely, because the plant refuses to bloom a second time where&#xD;
a wound is made by plucking off its beauties, and the Pro.&#xD;
fessor only cut it for his pupil upon great occasions, when she&#xD;
had done marvels in painting, or mastered a whole sonata up-&#xD;
on the violin, or charmed him with her Portuguese poetry, and&#xD;
she had rare pleasure in the gift thus bestowed, with many&#xD;
caressing words and quaint praises.&#xD;
" He hath had losses." Just so. Our Chris has had losses,&#xD;
and she is quite'a different person from the shy child who sat&#xD;
upon the old wall thatieth 'of May, and talked with Dr. Gro-&#xD;
enveldt, of the life "he could enjoy. The shyness is all gone,&#xD;
the quiet remains; but it is the quiet of a self-poised woman,&#xD;
who has suffered and conquered. . She looks in perfect health,&#xD;
but there is an habitual droop to her lip, which something&#xD;
nws its beauty, and a look of suffering about her wistful eyes.&#xD;
Her friends are satisfied with her cheerfulness, and she has&#xD;
smiles for them, and ready words, and plenty of kind helpful&#xD;
acts. Her strongly marked individuality s unchanged. She&#xD;
drops off into reveries, and has to be roused; and says qier&#xD;
things, and makes odd quotations from unknown sources, but&#xD;
she is womanly, discreet, earnest, and loving.&#xD;
Roger carme in with a couple of letters, which he handed to&#xD;
Chris, who laid aside her guitar to read them,&#xD;
" 'From Chaindos," she exclaimed, tearing open the top one,&#xD;
and reading hurriedly the fun, pranks, and bits-of travel with&#xD;
whieh that lighthearted youngster's epistles were always crammed&#xD;
as a liberal housewife stuffs her pudding with plums. Anen.&#xD;
joying laugh, and a kiss upon the "Chandy" -at the bottom,&#xD;
ended her perusal, and she handed it over to Bertha, who had&#xD;
been watching her with hungry eyes, and who retired to a cor-&#xD;
ner, to .devour it in quiet. Chris read through the second&#xD;
&#xD;
WOMEN MAY LOVE . AND NEVER MARRY.&#xD;
missive, with bent brows, and a contracted face,. and-rose with&#xD;
quick motion, and began walking up and .down, holding the&#xD;
paper in her fingers, and with eyes dwelling on the carpet..&#xD;
" Noble. fellow ! she said, aloud. "My dear Sonsie shallbe&#xD;
reasonable ! nothing shall, hinder the execution of -such a glo..&#xD;
rious scheme. I must write instantly."&#xD;
Bertha looked up in some surprise :at her excited face.&#xD;
"What is it, dear, which, brings .so much of your soul into&#xD;
your eyes?" asked she.&#xD;
"A letter frpm Jan Vedder; a noble manly letter, full of&#xD;
goodness. Why, when he leapt that gate up at Craienfel,&#xD;
I would not have believed he could ever -come out like&#xD;
this and mother said he was improper too"w&#xD;
Bertha gazed in a puzzle at her friend, trying toilecipher&#xD;
the signs about, her mobile'.lips, and ,to' read the emotion&#xD;
which was, evidently a powerful one. of its. kind.; but' Chriss&#xD;
next word chased away her thought.   .     '&#xD;
" He wishes to place Sonsie Eagan, our little Irish, protg6,&#xD;
here, among us; and begs me. to use my influence. withlti-, to&#xD;
moderate her pride, and show her her plain duty. His epistle&#xD;
is full of wit and sharp points, 'and he states his case with con-&#xD;

" How very strange.! does it not strike you that the child's&#xD;
life here would be a daily crucifixion? Poverty and: pride,&#xD;
and her antecedents, and nIrish blood'! .Why, Chris, they would&#xD;
kill her before she'd finishedd her first term; these schoolgirls&#xD;
are nerciess " . .'.&#xD;
" I do not think se, Bertha, at all.. Sonsie despises and walks&#xD;
over all obstacles ; and if she consents to come, theridicule of&#xD;
foolish girls, or their neglect, will be but the small dust of the&#xD;

"Let us go and find Sabrina, and get her opinion."&#xD;
Bertha put Chandy's letter into her pocket for a closer per-&#xD;
usal in the privacy of her apartment.&#xD;
"Nay, good sister, let Sabrina find us here. This is the&#xD;
fittest. place for a good talk that I know of, especially just at&#xD;
the gloaming, when the coals get red, and the shadows flicker&#xD;
and dance, and our crickets are beginning their concert."  She&#xD;
rang the bell. "Roger, please ask Miss Bradshaw to join us&#xD;
in the library,". said she.&#xD;
Prtty soon Sabrina, "the siver lake goddess," came.sailing&#xD;
in, her purple robe trailing  after her, her amber locks&#xD;
adorned with forget-me-nots, and diffusing about her the soft&#xD;
odor of the English violets she always carried. She advanced&#xD;
with a free step, and laid a soft touch upon her friend's arm,&#xD;
who, While waiting her coming, had shut herself among her&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
" Ah 1" Chris exclaimed, starting slightly, and smiling,-&#xD;
Sabrina-fair, devout, and pure,&#xD;
Sober, steadfast, and demure,&#xD;
We' want your opinion." She placed Jan's letter in her hand&#xD;
and waited for comments.&#xD;
"A strange:scheme, truly!" was the first, as she folded the&#xD;
missive-and returnedit. . Fear it willnot do ; and, apregos--&#xD;
I have a letter from Zoe, which I have neglected in my inter-&#xD;
est in Ariosto's capers, which he planted in his garden, and&#xD;
watched impatiently, till they.turned out to be. elder-trees.&#xD;
One who-intends to be greatly attentive to friends, and duties,&#xD;
must steer clear of that- witching poet ; but I beg Zoe's pardon,&#xD;
and will get through her pretty little ep tle' without delay."&#xD;
&#xD;
WOMEN MA Y LOVE, AND NE VER MARR Y 227&#xD;
Sabrina laughed, as she read - one of her musical songs of&#xD;
merry enjoyment, rippling, tuneful, 'sweet.&#xD;
"Our friends are leagued against the poor girl," said she,&#xD;
"I see no help for her. She -has no choice but to surrender,&#xD;
and be made a scholar and a lady of;.for I feel quite sure, Jan&#xD;
wishes to marry Sonsie."&#xD;
Sabrina was conscious of no pride of caste, but she could&#xD;
hardly credit the' story Zoe told her under the rose -that is,&#xD;
secretly among the three friends. Sonsie Eagan was to her but&#xD;
the Irish maiden rescued from starvation, a servant born in&#xD;
the serving class, and nothing more ; and it seemed to her un-&#xD;
natural that Jan should desire to lift her out of it by making&#xD;
her his wife. Jan ! whom she had learned to consider. noble-&#xD;
hearted fellow, endowed with charming social qualities, a dno&#xD;
little culture, beneath his free-and-easy exterior. She promised&#xD;
to help, and look after the young aspirant, in the trials .they&#xD;
all foresaw for her it Rosenbloom; but she could find n sym-&#xD;
pathy with the consummation ; and as for thinking of Sonsie&#xD;
Eagan as her equal ! that seemed to her simply impossible.&#xD;
"Our ardent little Zoe is zealous about it; full of praises&#xD;
of Sonsie ; and the dear girl is coming out strong as a plotter&#xD;
too, perfectly Michievelian, in fact.: only listen to her deep&#xD;
scheme. This Irish. marvel is to accompany her as maid, com-&#xD;
panion, friend, in her New York trip, and: they'll be here next&#xD;
week."&#xD;
"Zoe is indeed wise!" remarked Chris, smiling. "Do you&#xD;
remember that saying of Krumacher's ?  I offer you a golden&#xD;
apple in a silver rind : you receive the rind, and you find the&#xD;
apple ? I think I'll make Qne of your party, Sabrina: Ive iny&#xD;
prize money for expenses, and I'll hunt a pblisher fQr ny&#xD;
book."&#xD;
" What if you cannot," said Sabrina; " these publishers are  I&#xD;

erie creatures, they, say; they frown down any poor author,&#xD;
who makes a humble bow, with a roll of manuscript in&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
"I shall not make a humble bow,'V said Chris quietly.,&#xD;
John Peebles, a pale, large-eyed student, came in at this&#xD;
juncture accompanied, by his chum Dexter, who, Chris, said&#xD;
always reminded her of Lamb's plea for roast pig. "Consider !&#xD;
he is a weakling, a flower!'" They were seeking contributors&#xD;
for the "Chip-Basket," and were never turned empty away by&#xD;
Chris, who seemed to make time for everything, and hearing&#xD;
of the proposed trip, he said looking at her and speaking gen-&#xD;
erally, "I should like to go in your company; and I'll shoul-&#xD;
dermy green umbrella, and pilot Miss Chris safely out of the&#xD;
dens-of the lions."&#xD;
"'That will be conducive," said Sabrina. "Ah, dear Chandy;&#xD;
how hispet expressions cling to one; and flertha shall go too;&#xD;
our quartette must not be dissevered."&#xD;
Filer pattered in, with her hands full of themes, to tell them&#xD;
that they were all invited to the great parlor at eight, to make&#xD;
welcome some new pupils, and 'was pattering away again, rub-&#xD;
bing her red nose, when Chris seized on her, captured the&#xD;
papers, and made her listen to her plan.&#xD;
"~o, my dear, by all means," said she ; "it will do you good;&#xD;
and as for the book, it is a, good book. It has cost me as&#xD;
many tears as it, has given me nice laughs. Heigho, I am&#xD;
tired to death ! Here's a theme for a girl fifteen years old, on&#xD;
'Winter.' ' Winter is the coldest season in the year.  It&#xD;

" You will come away from school in a couple of years or so,"&#xD;
said Chris. "I'll not leave you behind me ; no indeed.! Filey is&#xD;
mine; I bought her with love. I shall be of age by and by,&#xD;
and I am going to carry you off, and see beautiful things. We'll&#xD;
travel up and down, a couple of unprotected females."&#xD;
"That would be nice," said the little, teacher, wiping her red&#xD;
eyes; 'quite too nice for me, but it warms me up-to know. that&#xD;
somebody wishes for me ; it is - such a long time since anybody&#xD;
has said ' dear' to me. Good-by - there's the supper bell !&#xD;
That Jane Muchley and Miss Teazle '11 be picking each others&#xD;
eyes out if I'm not there to keep them in order ; you never saw&#xD;
such a pair of quarrelsome little wasps. -Come ! what do you&#xD;
want?" she added, as a head appeared at the door.  'There ! I&#xD;
told you so. Jane has been at it again ! I hope Madame will be&#xD;
satisfied with her experiment. I assured her those girls would&#xD;
never do here. You may report a cipher, Miss Teazle."&#xD;
Filer walked :ff gimlet-eyed and rasping, and Chris felt heart..&#xD;
ily sorry for her 'vertasked nerves.&#xD;
Peebles singled out 'his favorite as soon as -her silver-gray&#xD;
robe floated into the drawing-room, and his pale face kindled&#xD;
a little at sight of the' slender wearer,. and he stopped to gather&#xD;
a Provence bud, which dropped from her breast-knot, as she&#xD;
glided in.&#xD;
"Miss Goldsmith," he offered his arm whimsically, -&#xD;
"Come spread your wings as I spread mine,&#xD;

of the good old stamp, and I was brought up at the foot of&#xD;
Gamil-hill, but when I was a little shaver I took a notion that&#xD;
I must have a few lessons ini the mazy whirl, and the old gen-&#xD;
tlerman's eyes twinkled, when he told me 'I might get a Couple&#xD;
of stout apple sprouts and come out to the barn, and he'd help&#xD;
me do all the dancing I wanted,' and I've lived long enough&#xD;
to respect his excellent' judgment. Dervishes and Shakers&#xD;
dance upon principle ; but I don't see what need brainy people&#xD;
have to amuse themselves with kicking up their heels, when&#xD;
there are so many rich mines of talk unworked. Look at my&#xD;
friend Dexter, now ! where's the use of'his spinning round that&#xD;
gait, making a pair of shears of himself ?"&#xD;
" Why, Mr. Peebles ! aren't you in rather a bad humor this&#xD;
evening?" asked Chris, laughing. "Is the Chip-Basket in&#xD;
fault, or the Greek roots?"&#xD;
" To tell the truth, Professor Noble has rasped my temper a&#xD;
.little, nagging me over that infernal (I beg pardon Miss Gold-&#xD;
smith) impracticable, flying-machine. I don't intend to fly my-&#xD;
self, and I don't care a groat how many pounds of air it takes&#xD;
to keep a man up, and push him along. There ! --(as a waltz-&#xD;
ing couple hit his shoulder, and disturbed his centre of gravity)&#xD;
-  there! that's just the way ; if you don't glue yourself to the&#xD;
plastering, somebody is -always pitching into you."&#xD;
" We will make haste and plant ourselves among the wall-&#xD;
flowers, Mr. Peebles, till you find your good-nature, which you&#xD;
have certainly mislaid in that unlucky flying-machine. You&#xD;
rail like a Kate. There's a time to dance, you know. I don't&#xD;
feel quite in the mood this evening; though I make it a reli-&#xD;
gions duty 'to stand up whenever I am asked, I must say I&#xD;
don't dote upon the amusementt"&#xD;
They edged away into a cosy bow-window, and talked; and&#xD;
John -Peebles'-tired face cleared, and his overstrung nerves&#xD;

relaxed; and a genial humor playing freely with his subjects,&#xD;
took the place of his carping discontent, andsin. fact anybody&#xD;
but" our preoccupied Chris, might have seen that he would&#xD;
come to the "old, old story," before many more sittings. They&#xD;
were interrupted in a spirited debate upon the "strong and&#xD;
gentle singer of the crusades," disagreeing in merry mood over&#xD;
his Tancred and rare Clorinda, by Madame, who came, wear-&#xD;
ing her hostess-face, and said to Chris with an odd mixture of&#xD;
respect and dislike.&#xD;
"I have a duty for you, my dear. There's Mr. Fosdick,&#xD;
my new young gentleman. I want you to take pity upon the&#xD;
stranger, and make him feel at home. I hear from. his friends&#xD;
that he is made of brains."&#xD;
"But how shall I manage, Madame ?" replied Chris accept-&#xD;
ing her office at once, and pleasantly, and returning the look&#xD;
she got with one of perfect, self-possessed dignity, neither re-&#xD;
tiring nor advancing.&#xD;
"You must draw him out, my dear."&#xD;
"Canst thou draw out the Leviathan with a hook," said Chris,&#xD;
whose eye caught Sabrina's in that unlucky instant, and whose&#xD;
soul fled on wings to Sonsie, her needs and.duties.&#xD;
John Peebles' hearty laugh, and Madame's face, brought&#xD;
Chris back, and she hastened to signify her readiness to amuse&#xD;
the stranger, "all brains," but she stood up to dance with her&#xD;
disobedient thoughts still busy, and the first number of the&#xD;
"Caledonians" was over, before she awakened to the fact that&#xD;
the partner was looking at her, and that she had, as ye&#xD;
no effort to draw him out.&#xD;
."Was Zoroaster an Egyptian or a Persian?" asked she.&#xD;
The mnoulinet hindered any reply, except a stare; and in the&#xD;
next pause, she returned to her conversational duties.&#xD;

" I haven't any idea, Miss, I'm sure," answered the brainy&#xD;
man, beginning to look alarmed, and she finished him off .eeto-&#xD;
tally, by saying in the next rest; --.a&#xD;
" Who preceded Heliogabulus among the Emperors?"&#xD;
As soon as the quadrille was finished, Mr. Fosdick made&#xD;
haste to. hand his partner to a seat, and he watched her nar.&#xD;
rowly, from remote corners of; the room, the remainder of the&#xD;
evening..&#xD;
" Chris, ChrisI what have you been about?" asked Sabrina,&#xD;
who had been near enough to.hear her rather remarkable efforts&#xD;
at making the stranger feel at horne.&#xD;
" Why, I've been 'drawing out' that long-legged monster&#xD;
over there by the window, as Madame directed Me, and I got&#xD;
nothing for my trouble beyond "yes and no.' He:follows the&#xD;
ecept too closely, 'let your communications be yea, yea, and&#xD;
say, nay.'. "ButI wash my hands of him. I've done my duty&#xD;
faithfully, and, by the way, Sabrina, where do you suppose my&#xD;
Sonsie will be classed here ?".&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
SONSIE. GQES TO CONFESSION.&#xD;
HE Ulster maiden was sitting in dust and ashes, figra.&#xD;
lively speaking, being down upon the floor in Ruth&#xD;
Blair's kitchen, with her apron over her head weaving&#xD;
back and forth, sobbing and meaning. Ruth found her in this&#xD;
penitential attitude, wten she came in from "her walk with&#xD;
Pigeon.  ..-&#xD;
"Why, onsiewhat has happened?" she asked-in: alarm.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sonsie thrust out an open letter without removing her veil.&#xD;
"'Tis Miss Chris, who's been writin' to me. She says I'm&#xD;
sinful, wicked, ungrateful, and . fly in the face of Providence,&#xD;
that has raised me up powerful friends."&#xD;
+ "She does! Why, what have you been about, Sonsie, to&#xD;
deserve such hard words at the hand of our kind Chris ? "&#xD;
" Leastways, she says it will be all that, if I don't put me&#xD;
pride in me pocket, and -make meself a debtor for life to Mrs.&#xD;
Vedder, and niver be able to hold up me head any more."&#xD;
" That's very odd, Sonsie; it don't sound like Chris."&#xD;
" Read the letter, please, Miss Ruthie, and see if ye don't&#xD;
find it all there."&#xD;
Ruth ran her eyes down the page, and rattled it back into its&#xD;
folds, full of eager enthusiasm.i.&#xD;
"And so you have a chance to-mske a.woman of yourself !&#xD;
Go down on your knees directly, and thank God for his great&#xD;
goodness!"&#xD;
Sonsie pulled down her apron, and gazed upon her mistress&#xD;
an instant.&#xD;
"Will ye plase say them words again, Miss Ruthie:?"&#xD;
Ruth did, say .thinf, and. even stronger than before, and&#xD;
made the girl tell her the whole story.&#xD;
"I'll go immediately an ese rsVedder myself," said she,&#xD;
excitedly, "and talk it, over with her;; and I only? hope your&#xD;
foolish conduct has not disgusted her, and so shut up her heart&#xD;
that she will refuse to listen to me."&#xD;
Sonsie looked about 'her as. one looks down a precipice over&#xD;
which he has got to leap; and then, she searched Ruth's face,&#xD;
and found only stern determination there. She rose, set her&#xD;
arms akimbo, and turned her head over her shoulder.&#xD;
"No, me mistress; I'll even go meself! Me two friends,&#xD;

me no wrong; ye can't know the bitter taste of dependence-&#xD;
I'll swallow the dose ; but if I must give up my freedom, i'&#xD;
throw it down at Mrs. Vedder's feet meself! I'll not be&#xD;
dragged to her like the prisoners Ollam Folda had chained to&#xD;
the tail of his horse those times."&#xD;
Ruth was amused, beneath her anxiety, by Sonsie's manner -&#xD;
but she took care to keep a serious countenance.&#xD;
Go, then, without delay, and do your work thoroughly."&#xD;
Jan came in, and found the Milesian neatly habited, and just&#xD;
drawing on her gloves.&#xD;
"Whither away, Sonsie ?" asked he.&#xD;
"I'm goin' to confession," she replied, darting a resentful&#xD;
side-glance at him. "Ye can come along Wid me, for a young&#xD;
heretic, and see how a true Catholic makes a clean breast of her&#xD;
 sins. Ye'll have no call for yer teasin' talk, ---' Ollam Folda,'&#xD;
and those, --I'm going' to put my soul into yer mother's hand,&#xD;
and let her do anything she wants wid it. D'ye mind that&#xD;
now !"_o&#xD;
Jan threw a puzzled look at Ruth, beneath which there was&#xD;
a gleam of exultation he was afraid of -showing..&#xD;
"She intends -to be a very good child, Mr. Vedder, and beg&#xD;
to be sent to school," said Ruth, smiling.&#xD;
"AhI you have seen the folly of it, and are about to eat a&#xD;
slice of humble-pie. I remember you once treated me to a.&#xD;
goodly portion.. I found it wholesome. I can recommend&#xD;
the regimen."&#xD;
I' li have a pretty little mother confessor, anyhow."&#xD;
"But you can't touch me there- I had a beauty."&#xD;
If the young fellow hoped for any pleasure from his wall to&#xD;
Brookedge, by the side of the girl who stepped off so fleetly, he&#xD;
was disappointed, for she threw him nothing but jeers and&#xD;
hor answers the whole way. Mrs. Vedder "was reading in&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
her easy-chair, with Polly Ann Maria on the arm, and Rainbow&#xD;
and Flirt on the rug before the wood fire.&#xD;
"Ye can stop there by the door, Mr. Vedder, sir," said&#xD;
Soisie shortly to the young heir ; and "'twould do ye no harm&#xD;
to pater a few prayers for yer own sins, while I am getting' me&#xD;
shrift."&#xD;
She walked proudly up to the 'amazed little lady, and&#xD;
dropped upon her knees before her, looking straight into her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Will ye please let me go-to-school-at-yer-expinse, ma'am,&#xD;
and - make-me-yer-debtor-andslave, till-such-time-as-I'm-able-to&#xD;
Although much amused by the rapidity of the high-keyed,&#xD;
one-toned utterance, Mrs. Vedder was also a good deal moved.&#xD;
She fully comprehended the struggle which the girl had passed&#xD;
through, and valued it as it deserved. -Her son was standing&#xD;
expectantly in. the door, where he had been bidden to tarry&#xD;
and pray; and she smiled at him before she took Sonsie's rosy&#xD;
chin into her jewelled fingers, and questioned the honest eyes&#xD;
which grew violet velvet deep beneath her gaze ; and she was&#xD;
exceeding glad, and kissed her warmly.&#xD;
"Wilt thou also come to my home and be mygood daughter,&#xD;
thou brave child?" said she, softly and slowly. "Say 'yes'&#xD;
quickly, and make us both happy -- me and my Jan."&#xD;
The young man took a step forward, and Sonsie rose to her&#xD;
feet proudly erect, her full bust out, and her round, fresh-&#xD;
colored arm, from which the loose, b lack sleeve fell away,&#xD;
extended independently toward him.&#xD;
" I'm a grateful girl, Mrs. Vedder," said she. "I pray God&#xD;
that he'll let me live to prove it. I'll take thankfully the hand&#xD;
ye kindly reach down to me, and I'll put me soul into the work&#xD;
ye offer, and try hard to be a credit to me purty patron; but&#xD;

I'm a servant, now, ma'am; I've took a place wid Miss Wal-&#xD;
singham, as her maid,. till she comes from New York ; I'm to&#xD;
work for her' wages; that's me. home just now. If I was&#xD;
another girl, that hadn't been where I was, she might accept&#xD;
yer goodness, and slip easily into the station ye offer. But ye&#xD;
remember, ma'am, we talked agood bit, one day, over that&#xD;
same, and I laid me' soul bare to you."&#xD;
" Very well, my dear ; you may.-do your duty then; I will&#xD;
not trouble you any more," replied Mrs. Vedder, as if the&#xD;
service plan were no news to her. "I also shall come in, I&#xD;
hope, for a share of your' kind 'offices on. the journey, because&#xD;
my Jan and I are to be of your party. I love, of all things, to&#xD;
be read toi sleep by a sweet :youpg voice, Sonsie. You should&#xD;
be a rare reader,: with the delicate tones you are always giving&#xD;
- the tips and downs. There's wonderful variety to you."&#xD;
"Miss Zoet spake of yer-going, ma'am; and ivery thing me&#xD;
two hands =an do, I'll do joyfully. ' Me bear is yours intirely."&#xD;
Jant came striding. up.. "Stop to supper,, Sonsie," said he..&#xD;
" Mother'll giveus Dutch pancakes with honey, and olykoeks ;,&#xD;
and well have a game of billiards -while we are waiting."&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, my dear child,-you must stop, because I have&#xD;
to speak with 'you, about my plans. You are to be a school-&#xD;
girl, -and my ward, 'as-son as you have finishes the service&#xD;
with Zoe; andl there:are arrangements to perfect."&#xD;
It Iolly,. put thekette on, 'and we'llsall have tea,",said the&#xD;
green'parrot, launching her order at Sonsie, and changing her&#xD;
eyes iito balls of fiere range light..&#xD;
" She knows quite well, does yon burrd, which is the ser-&#xD;
vant amongst us' three, ma'am;" said Sonsie, wwith provoking&#xD;
brightness, as she took' off: her hat and cloak and hung' them&#xD;
tidily' upon the; rack, and ,prepared, with clear-eyed attention,&#xD;
to take up any occupation; which  her hostess offered her-; and&#xD;
&#xD;
SONSIE GOES TO CONFESSION.               237&#xD;
both mother and son felt that she never for one moment&#xD;
forgot her valuation of herself, or the plan of life she had&#xD;
marked out for her future, though she was sprightly, witty,&#xD;
modestly-bold, through 'it all. - She had never seen a billiard-&#xD;
table in her life ; but while Jan explained the- game, and made&#xD;
some shots, she watched him with the concentrated attention&#xD;
she was capable of, and, inspired by the desire she' had to do&#xD;
every thing she saw others do, and rather surpass them if pos=&#xD;
sible, she comprehended and took up a cue with: the utmost.&#xD;
confidence in -her power to succeed, and made such a good&#xD;
game that Jan declared she must be a secret votary of the art,&#xD;
and might instruct:her teacher.&#xD;
" Indade,: Mr. Vedder, ye were lilting so merrily while I&#xD;
played, that. me balls could not choose" but rin gaily home to&#xD;
yer music ; and I never took a whiff of me breath=to help it&#xD;
either, as I saw you: doing just now, when the' red one tarried&#xD;
on the edge of the pocket, like a burrd on the rim of its nest,&#xD;
till ye just blew it in."&#xD;
His mother laughed, and told him it was only her bright eyes&#xD;
and steady nerves that helped her out. "Sonsie is a good&#xD;
child, I know, and takes 'kind care of the temple. God has.&#xD;
shrined her soul in," said she.&#xD;
Jan laid down the cue softly, and walked away with so sor-&#xD;
rowful a countenance that the quick-witted, sympathetic girl&#xD;
guessed, his thought, and went after him, and engaged hih in&#xD;
such a sharp dispute, and got so signally beaten, that he was&#xD;
in harmony with himself again, and then the three had a charmn-&#xD;
ing supper together.&#xD;
"You see, mother, it% was that first kiss which spoiled my&#xD;
game," said Jan.&#xD;
"A kiss spoils a life, sometimes,-,my boy," she replied; and&#xD;
Jan looked 'at Sonsie, and wondered if she remnerrbered how he&#xD;

had wished to touch her lips, on the hill, that day, and saw in&#xD;
her: face that she had forgotten nothing ; and he would have&#xD;
given anything, done anything, to blot it out from her thoughts.&#xD;
Afterwards he left his mother and his love sitting close to the&#xD;
piano, on which the fairy lady played Irish reels to the young&#xD;
maid, and sang old ballads loved in her youth: " The Captive&#xD;
Knight," "The Blue Moselle," "The Troubadour." She&#xD;
gave them but once, and Sonsie owned them afterwards;&#xD;
could reproduce them at her- pleasure. Jan had business, he&#xD;
said, with his church committee, and would return and attend&#xD;
the guest home in proper season.&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder talked school, and mentioned Rosenbloom.&#xD;
' Ah I Miss Chris is there," said Sonsie, kindling up.&#xD;
"Yes, my child." Mrs. Vedder saw gladly how the warm&#xD;
heart of her proteg6 glowed with love for her first friend, and&#xD;
she smiled. "That, in fact, is a great reason why. I fixed upon&#xD;
the school for you. It is, besides, the choicest one I know,&#xD;
both for pupils and teachers. Some of the best blood in the&#xD;
country is there ; and you will meet culture and grace and&#xD;
fashion, as well as .scholarship.  Madame Groenveldt has&#xD;
comprehensive ideas of what a school should be, and she&#xD;
carries them out magnificently. You can't help getting on,&#xD;
very way."&#xD;
Sonsie listened, with her eyes upon her hostess' face, and&#xD;
replied, -&#xD;
"I can make those fine people to be most useful to me, in-&#xD;
deed. A teacher ought to use all ways to get good manners.&#xD;
It gives them power, that I know. And still, I'll keep neself&#xD;
so quiet, that they'll nivir dream I'm observing 'em. In the&#xD;
Bible, it says, '.be with 'em, but not of 'em.' That's just me,&#xD;
case, isn't it, ma'am? "&#xD;
Though the girl's face and manner were not particularly&#xD;
&#xD;
promising for the elaboration of her plans, Mrs. Vedder went&#xD;
on talking fast and talking well; but she could find no words,&#xD;
no caresses, which would induce her to entertain for a moment&#xD;
an intention to accept an outfit. When she was tenderly im-&#xD;
plored to afford her hostess the pleasure of being kind, the&#xD;
young girl seized the small hand which sought hers, and cov-&#xD;
ered it with kisses, and poured out a flood of eloquence, half&#xD;
sobs, half blessings, and was as firm as a rock.&#xD;
"I'm going to school by yer kindness, Mrs. Vedder. Miss&#xD;
Chris and me mistress says 'tis the right thing for me to put&#xD;
me life into yer purty hand. I don't look like dyin'; do I&#xD;
ma'am?".&#xD;
She straightened herself before the little lady, and threw back&#xD;
her shoulders.&#xD;
" Not much, Sonsie, my dear; at least, not at this present&#xD;
minute."&#xD;
"I think I shall live; -I've prayed that I may, and I believe&#xD;
I shall somehow get back me independence again, along of&#xD;
yer goodness. I can't just see how, but I think it will be given&#xD;
me. Just put yersel' in me place, ma'am, as much as a true-&#xD;
born lady can feel the same as a poor Irish lass, and ye'll see&#xD;
that though I do be thankful for the chance I'm gettin', it is not&#xD;
right for me to take gifts to plaze me vanity --dresses and&#xD;
things -and 'ye'll never be offended, I'm sure. I'll sell me&#xD;
little black pig, and I'll save me wages that I earn with Miss&#xD;
Zoe, and I'll be.decent and trim; and that is all I need. I've&#xD;
a good plan for earning money in the holidays, that'll stead m&#xD;
through."&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder gave up in despair, and dreaded to acknowl-&#xD;
edge her failure to her son ; and after the young people had&#xD;
left her for their walk to the Horseshoe by moonlight, she&#xD;
sat and turned the subject about and about in her thoughts,&#xD;

&#xD;
till she clapped ' her hands in glee over her happy inspiration;&#xD;
the first step of which was to establish an acquaintance with&#xD;
Ruth, and she considered herself justifiable in invading her pri-&#xD;
vacy in such a cause; and the two ladies put their heads&#xD;
together, and plottedlike Jesuits or women.&#xD;
One day,: not long after Sonsie's visit to Brookedge, Ruth&#xD;
took occasion 'to tell her a story of her own school experience.&#xD;
Sonsie heard her attentively, and looking at the pretty&#xD;
woman who' talked, she had little trouble to fill up her word.&#xD;
pictures, of a young, blooming, modest little orphan, in poor&#xD;
garments, slighted and ridiculed by the riders of the ponies,&#xD;
and the wearers of silken robes and gauds ; and she answered&#xD;
indignantly, but with undaunted mien, -&#xD;
"'Tis thrue for ye, Miss Ruthie ! and I'd like to choke the&#xD;
nasty villains for threatin' ye, so, and ye a nicelittle lady yersel'.&#xD;
But I know who I am.    I go to school for the idication, and&#xD;
sorra a fling they'll iver get at me, at 'all, at all, through me&#xD;
kapin mesel' to mesel', entirely."&#xD;
When Ruth changed her ground, and lectured severely, upon&#xD;
the sin of flying in the face of Providence, and being. stiff-&#xD;
necked and ungrateful, Sonsie turned white as a ghost, and her&#xD;
eyes grew velvet. violet, while she thought,' and then she came&#xD;
out clear, confident as ever.&#xD;
"I cannot see that, Miss Ruthie.  'Tis no duty, sure, to&#xD;
dress fine, at another's cost, when there isn't a chance for me&#xD;
ivir in the world to pay the debt. If it was you, now, I'd be&#xD;
joyful to take yer favors;' yer like the dear little mother to me,&#xD;
only yer too winsome to be ary kin at all; but the gentlefolks&#xD;
down 'at Brookedge, they're just strangers. 'Tis me only chance&#xD;
for: a realdrespectable idication, and. I've 'given in to it, and I'm&#xD;
goin' to be thankful. Please leave off tormenting' a poor girl any&#xD;

THY LO0 VE? IS BETTER THAN WINE.         2 41&#xD;
more, and tell Mrs. Vedder niver to spake again to me of&#xD;
clothes."&#xD;
Mrs. Blair confided her convictions . to Jan's 'mother, who&#xD;
spoke hopefully to her son, but she was every day less confi-&#xD;
dent of his success. The more she saw of the: firm strongrna-&#xD;
ture of this girl, who counted all her steps,, the more thoroughly&#xD;
she was convinced that her boy would have no chance with her&#xD;
but what love would give him.  Gratitude, respect, she found&#xD;
in her, and plenty of amusing mother wit, and she somehow&#xD;
knew for certain that Sonsie Eagan had got to love with all the&#xD;
strength of her bountiful nature, when she gave up her coy,&#xD;
independent soul to the keeping of a husband. It was evident,&#xD;
while she watched the two together, that no dream of love had&#xD;
ever ruffled the waves of her being. She was easy and pleas-&#xD;
.                     ..&#xD;
ant with Jan, in a certain way, 'and' always talked unreservedly&#xD;
with him, but it was, as he said, " across a gulf.  However&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder kept her knowledge to herself and' hoped every.&#xD;
thing from the four years she had planned for her prot6g6 at&#xD;
Rosenbloom.&#xD;

to take her hand, he could not help putting it to his lips. The&#xD;
pupils looked on astonished ; none of them had ever gotten&#xD;
such a demonstration ; even Zoe came in only second best;&#xD;
but not one of her friends comprehended the mixed emotions&#xD;
which swelled within her. When her love was new, the hap-.&#xD;
piest hours were mixed up with Sonsie Eagan. She had prom-&#xD;
ised the lass a home in Otho Groenveldt's house ; all the ten-&#xD;
derness and joy of those days awoke ! and she fell upon her&#xD;
neck and wept. Sonsie needed no betterendorsers. Sabrina's&#xD;
elegance, Zoe's wit, and Christabel's scholarship, opened the&#xD;
gates royal wide, and though, when she really became an in..&#xD;
mate of the place, she - was made to suffer some slings and&#xD;
arrows of outrageous girls, this day was all rose color, and&#xD;
she longed for the time to arrive when she could begin, and-&#xD;
conquer a place for herself.&#xD;
Chris seized on the young maid eagerly, with excited coun-&#xD;
tenance, and bore her off to red-nosed, gimlet-eyed Filer, who&#xD;
declared that she was "tired to death of striving with the pots-.&#xD;
herds of the earth" (meaning stupid scholars), and who, after&#xD;
having given a parting cypher to the last of the potsherds, sank&#xD;
back with a weary sigh, dreading to undertake a new lot.&#xD;
"Here, you good Filer," said she, "I've brought you some-&#xD;
thing ! a rara avis ! an emerald ! pure and clear ! a soul un-&#xD;
spotted,-and as sweet as a rose, and she's my friend, but 'll let&#xD;
you share in her love.  We are to have her here; not ',ong&#xD;
your potsherds, though, because I'll. tell you a secret -- she's got&#xD;
the most wonderful gift of story-telling, and the richest brogue..&#xD;
She'll -weave you tales that will make' you wipe your eyes, and,&#xD;
sob for sorrow. She thirsts for knowledge ; she'll work like&#xD;
a cart-horse or a beaver; you may stuff her, Filer, cram her, and&#xD;
&#xD;

she'll go down on her knees and thank you. 'Here, Sonsie,&#xD;
show how your eyes can laugh ; there ! did you ever see the&#xD;
like of that ? This is my teacher, my-good, dear, friend, and&#xD;
she's going to be yours. She nursed me when I was sick, and&#xD;
such toast as she can make. Come here, Sonsie, and kiss Miss&#xD;
Filer, directly."&#xD;
The amused Celt obeyed instantly, taking in the. situation,&#xD;
and comprehending the character offered her at once, and&#xD;
Chris put her arms around them both, and thrust her head be-&#xD;
tween, and kissed two -cheeks, one rosy and tempting, and&#xD;
the other, thin, wrinkled, and old,. and it were hard to tell&#xD;
which of the two recipients felt most pleasure in her affec-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Here !" said she, seizing a bundle of themes the teacher&#xD;
held, "I'm to do those, and you're to get your candle out by&#xD;
ten o'clock this night, or I shall give you a failure -yea, a&#xD;
cypher, Filer."                             /&#xD;

perfection of the gregarious living which Americans&#xD;
delight in so thoroughly, as the favored ones who have basked&#xD;

bles' sensible talk. Oh,. the intolerable bitter of the to seem,&#xD;
when the to be has been wrecked in a life-storm. Still, I think,&#xD;
none of them observed any want in' her. Even John, himself,&#xD;
whose eyes found ever-renewing food for conteniplation. in her&#xD;
face, never guessed how her hungry soul longed for a little&#xD;
taste of its old happiness. Good, quiet Bertha sat apart. She&#xD;
heard Zoe's talk with Sabrina,-"silks, poplins, point-lace, and&#xD;
cashmeres,"-ithad little significance to her. She was thinking&#xD;
of a handsome boy who threw oranges into her lap, and, with&#xD;
her veil down, she indulged herself in recalling every word and&#xD;
look Chandy had given her that day ; and she remembered&#xD;
also Chris's saying, "'We know that women may love, and&#xD;
never marry."&#xD;
The girls flitted from room to room, while the luggage was&#xD;
coming up, and looked through each other's windows; and Son-&#xD;
sie, as soon as she found which was to be Zoe's room, began&#xD;
putting up her things, and was just going for the keys to take&#xD;
out the dresses, when Mrs. Vedder peeped in.&#xD;
"My daughter" (she seemed to take intense pleasure in the&#xD;
word), "come with me. I must have your room next mine,&#xD;
because I like being read to sleep, you know, and your voice is&#xD;
sweet and pleasant to my ear ; and I've fetched along 'Legends&#xD;
of Ireland,' to begin with, till you and I have an opportunity&#xD;
to take a turn among the bookstores and find something nice&#xD;
and new."&#xD;
"Ohyes, Mrs. Vedder, as soon as Miss Zoe has dismissed&#xD;
me, I'll be there gladly."&#xD;
That young lady came flying along, and gave Sonsie a little&#xD;
push.&#xD;
"Go !" said she, "get ready for dinner ; I need not :say&#xD;
'make yourself nice,' because you are always that, and  L know&#xD;

&#xD;
you will never keep anybody waiting :. I wish I could say as&#xD;
much for myself."&#xD;
The lassie was about to speak of the keys and her duties; but&#xD;
she changed he'r mind and did as she was bid.&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder's room opened into Sonsie's; but the door was&#xD;
shut between them, and nobody intruded upon her privacy,&#xD;
while she, arranged her trifles upon the table, and laid out her&#xD;
Bible and prayer-book, walking briskly and enjoyingly about&#xD;
the place, examining every thing, and turning over the events&#xD;
of the journey. -She was well pleased, too, With herself, in her&#xD;
spotless black gown, clear white cuffs and little collar, and she&#xD;
tied back her hair with a bright green ribbon, and looked as&#xD;
fresh as a rose. She had been gazing, for a quarter of an hour,&#xD;
down upon the street, wondering if the hand-organ, which the&#xD;
one-armed fellow ground at so industriously, made any noise,&#xD;
because none reached her elevated position; and thinking&#xD;
about a houseful of street-musicians, and strolling children,&#xD;
she and Dennie used to know ; and of'the hard times they had ;&#xD;
the beatings and starvation; and of the offer she'had got once&#xD;
to travel with a handsome, wicked young Italian stroller, with&#xD;
whom she had lilted and danced, and who played a harp, and&#xD;
.of the free, gay days he had promised her under the trees,&#xD;
among the hay-ricks (which had killed her friendship for him);&#xD;
and then of Jan Vedder and' his Irish harp,- Jan, whQ had&#xD;
said, " I'd willingly put the world behind me to live such a life&#xD;
in your company, Sonsie!" - and she dropped upon her knees&#xD;
before the white bed, and covered her face with her hands. I&#xD;
cannot tell the color of her thoughts, nor what manner of, peti-&#xD;
tions she offered; but I know that when there came a soft tap&#xD;
at her door, and she composedly rose, her lashes were Wet,&#xD;
and her heart was strong and brave. Chris stood before the&#xD;
opened porte, in her rosy gray dress and musk-rose breast-knot;&#xD;

hand a bunch of damask buds, which she held up to the Ulster&#xD;
maiden's -face, and smiled.&#xD;
" Just the color of your' cheeks," said she, "and smell how&#xD;
they have the odor of Paradise. I shall fasten them into your&#xD;
bonny green snood, and every breeze that kisses them will toss&#xD;
you down a thought of me. I can give you no more flowers&#xD;
after these, which, you see, my dear Papa Groenveldt put me&#xD;
into waxen mittens; because he knows I love a blossom in my&#xD;
breast ; but they will all droop before to-morrow. My good,&#xD;
good Sonsie ! howI rejoice ! how glad I am for you ! I have&#xD;
had no privacy, as yet, in which to say how happy it makes me&#xD;
to know- that you are to be mine in Rosenbloom, my very own!&#xD;
I know, quite well, that you can never feel toward any other&#xD;
girl as you feel toward me,; your eyes tell me how pleasant I&#xD;
am tor you. -You never look at anybody else as you look at me,&#xD;
and I am very glad. Your intense loving nature is such a mar-&#xD;
vellously gorgeous treasure-queen, who gives royally and blesses&#xD;
in bestowing as also in receiving. Ah ! how you will adore a&#xD;
husband, some of these days! But mind, I'm first. I know I&#xD;
am one and all to-day ; then I shall be only' somewhat. Oh,&#xD;
how often I have wished for your strong arms to fold me in&#xD;
loving clasp,' and to rest: my head just here, Where I can hear&#xD;
your true heart beat."&#xD;
Sonsie rained kisses upon tge chestnut curls which swept her&#xD;
shoulders, and she held rosy-tipped fingers in her supple ones,&#xD;
over which she breathed such words as a devotee murmurs to&#xD;
her patron saint ; and after a-little Chris stood up and put her&#xD;
haids upon the young girl's shoulders, and studied her, think-&#xD;
ing of her as Jan Vedder's wife in her " absolute perfection of&#xD;
bodily health, and her full capacity for mental pefettability ;"&#xD;
and she intuitively felt that Jan was twiser- than his .fellows.&#xD;

were both watching her ; and she advanced at once. -&#xD;
"Yes, Miss, Zoe," said she in her modest-bold way, "I am&#xD;

"Certainly not. I have full use of my arms, and if I hadn't&#xD;
I should pack my luggage on to Peter ; that's why I. permitted&#xD;

"I thought such offices were part of a maid's duty, Miss&#xD;

" That is a particular and- complete - misapprehension of&#xD;

Peter looked at his fiance in admiring wonder, and Jan took&#xD;

And the bland gentleman in full dress, who had been politely&#xD;
waiting their time, did show the two 'to a. small niche in the&#xD;
corner, where there was a gilded shelf for the finger-bowls and&#xD;
doylies, which made a capital place for their books, and: where&#xD;
they proceeded- to talk it out " on that line ;" though they&#xD;
agreed better as to dinner-edibles than abstruse doctrines, for&#xD;
both ate the simplest fare the bill afforded, and both drank&#xD;
water from the Croton. After dinner was over, Sonsie went&#xD;
up and took Chris's hand reverently, and led her to her apart-&#xD;
ment, and shut the door.&#xD;
"Miss Chris," said she, "what makes a lady ?"&#xD;
Chris replied readily, and wonderfully pleased,&#xD;
" Purity, truth, delicacy, culture, and it may be, purple blood ;&#xD;
but that is as God wills ;'" and as Sonsie held her to- a clear&#xD;
definition of her words, she gave it fully, distinctly. The&#xD;
attentive lassie thanked her, kissed her hand, and went away to&#xD;
her own room and conned over what she had got.&#xD;
"There's the O'Roukes- for the purple blood. Purity !&#xD;
The Bible says, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall&#xD;
see God. That means in heaven ; or no - it means that the&#xD;
pure shall be able to find the purity that God has put into his&#xD;
creatures.. I see it in the face of me white angel. Truth. I've&#xD;
got thatin me soul.- Holy Mother be thanked! Delicacy.". She&#xD;
thought a long time over that, and shook her head despairingly.&#xD;

EINES FREUNDES STIMME.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
EINES FREUNDES STIMME.&#xD;
L but the two mammals, who were too fatigued for&#xD;
any further exertion, and preferred a quiet chat-in the&#xD;
-great parlor, agreed to spend the evening at the Dus-&#xD;
seldorf Gallery, and two young fellows were certainly very&#xD;
happy during that walk- I think I might shy three, perhaps.&#xD;
Jan Vedder had Sonsie Eagan on his arm. It had never hap-&#xD;
pened before, much as he had walked about the country in her&#xD;
company; and when he got the round, supple member to rest&#xD;
lightly on his coat-sleeve, he felt as if he had made a-long stride&#xD;
toward;his wishes. There was a certain brisk power in the tap&#xD;
of Sonsie's firm foot, and an enjoying outlook from her deep,&#xD;
clear eyes, which made it a pleasure to walk by her side, and&#xD;
the two stepped out as though a ten or twenty mile walk:&#xD;
would be play to them; -but Mr. Jan hardly knew his ground,&#xD;
nor the spirit which possessed the soul of the Ulster maid, who&#xD;
had not yet digested her meditations upon Christabel's "lady.",&#xD;
Chris walked with John Peebles, and let him talk about con-&#xD;
cretions and juxtapositions; and, as an hour :with Miss Gold-&#xD;
smith was the highest form of 'happiness John Peebles knew,&#xD;
when enriched by metaphysics andGreek roots, he more than&#xD;
enjoyed it.&#xD;
A Venus de Mer, near the entrance of the gallery, fixed Chris's&#xD;
eyes, and sent her thoughts back to the' old studio, and the sit-&#xD;
tings she had given her papa for his golden-haired picture of&#xD;
the sea-shell goddess ; and she was still standing before it when&#xD;
Sonsie came back to her..&#xD;
"o dear Miss Chris t is there niver ary Irish painting&#xD;
amongst the whole of these ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" No, Sonsie ; there have been Irish painters, -Joe Ellis, for&#xD;
instance, - who 'personified the very creamwof Hibernian good&#xD;
nature.' He was an- original fellow, too; studied his subjects&#xD;
as seemed to him good, and imitated nobody., He went up to&#xD;
London full of Irish life and .hope, and wit and frolic; and he&#xD;
finished some good pictures, and got some success and a;little&#xD;
money, till he fell in with a- crafty rogue, who duped him owt&#xD;
of his best efforts, under the character. of friend; and afterward,&#xD;
till he died in poverty, he slaved for picture-dealers, and re-&#xD;
peated endless views'of Venice, which were colored and sold&#xD;
for antiques. He was a gifted gentleman, but he lacked pru-&#xD;
dence and foresight, 'small loss' and 'divil may care,' being&#xD;
favorite comments of his upon great misfortunes."&#xD;
" Just as Mr. Jan said," thought Sonsie; " Irish folks are&#xD;
always jumping into bramble-bushes. I'll not do that same.";&#xD;
"Then there was that Elniere," went on Chris, "who&#xD;
painted , dreadful- picture of Marie Antoinette. facing the mob&#xD;
of the Tuileries. It would keep sleep from your pillow to look&#xD;
at, Sonsie ; so we won't talk about it. Then there was--let&#xD;
me see--one Maclise, of Cork; he painted the 'Origin of the&#xD;
Harp.'"&#xD;
"Yes !" exclaimed Sonsie,  her quick cheery way of utter-&#xD;
ing this monosyllable when-she was pleased, is indescribable,--&#xD;
"the Irish harp, is it, Miss Chris? Mr. Vedder says I should&#xD;
have one of those."&#xD;
"I quite approve," answered Chris, sedately. "After you&#xD;
have studied the piano it might be an excellent plan. You've&#xD;
such pretty hands and arms, and you will despise the sore fin-&#xD;
gers and the blisters. Zoe tried it and', she got disgusted the&#xD;
first week, and kept her digits in glycerine, and grumbled and&#xD;
scolded for a whole month; but she used' tohave creeping fits&#xD;
when her finger nails hit the piano keys. Sabrina often teases&#xD;

A' pangclutched' Christabel's heart, and blanched her face,&#xD;
and Max went on speaking rapidly.&#xD;
" I am off in a couple of days for Germany.' I hope 'twas&#xD;
my good angel had me in convoy when I came, idly to this&#xD;
place. I 'knew I' was looking for something rich and choice,&#xD;
and I was just thinking of you,- too, when,. I heard your voice.&#xD;
I never forget voices. I 'think we; shall take thern to' heaven&#xD;
with us; of a certainty, no-celestial harp can ever give us such&#xD;
dear music as Eines Freundes Stiere."&#xD;
The young German's leonine eyes' spoke his feelings so&#xD;
plainly that Chris withdrew her hand in trembling. confusion.&#xD;
Max mistook her emotion, and 'read its signs 'to suit his wishes.&#xD;
Men are always making 'such mistakes.&#xD;
"I was about to journey toward Rosenbloon Mees Gold-&#xD;
schmidt, to take leave "ofthe.yGroenveldts 'afid' get news of, my&#xD;
friend Otho, who has been a lo t : Pleiad 'to me ever since we&#xD;

than the valsing,- and also to'execute a commission I had' or&#xD;
her, a sort of bequest which1has been travelling in'search of an&#xD;
owner, like Cinderella's 'slipper."&#xD;
It was a painful'.half-hour; for Chris, but full' 'of fascination.&#xD;
Max's constant reference to 'Oth "in his talk, and his evident&#xD;
delight in this chance meeting which 'he expressed in, his-rich&#xD;
German and. rather inverted;'English, and every flash of his&#xD;
yellow-brown eyes; his embarrassing inquiries=about her life,&#xD;
and' the vivid recollection' he showed for ekery one of her looks&#xD;

&#xD;
crimson gusts,- and her wistful eyes got humid with unshed&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
Sonsie:stood modestly apart while they talked, weighing the&#xD;
young doctor in her mental balance, observant of his attitudes&#xD;
and gestures, - insensibly comparing him -with a young hunter&#xD;
she knew, and noting also her darling's demeanor; and, all un,&#xD;
skilled as she was in love, she guessed the solution of the&#xD;
tumult of emotions which trembled over her and fluttered&#xD;
through her parted lips in sweet warm breath.&#xD;
Before the others had made the tour of the inner galleries,&#xD;
he was .gone, and they found the two young girls standing&#xD;
quietly before the great picture of "Desdemona listening to&#xD;
her Moor ;" and Chris, with a tired face, was explaining the&#xD;
story in a low smooth voice to Sonsie, whose eyes never left&#xD;
the brown ones she loved. She wondered if she would speak&#xD;
of Max, knowing almost beforehand that she could not, and&#xD;
admired the ready attention and patient look she gave John&#xD;
Peebles, who descanted at length: upon a series of Pompeian&#xD;
frescos he had been studying with a view to their mythological&#xD;
meaning, and which lasted him till they entered the St. James&#xD;
vestibule, and he had still something to say about it when they&#xD;
sat down to supper, when Jan rather "troubled the pool" of&#xD;
his thoughts by putting it to the assembled party whether or&#xD;
no they could fully agree with Antoinette- Brown in her "de-&#xD;
nunciation of sentient but irrational natures constituted accord.&#xD;
ing to sentient or qualitative piixiciples co-ordinated with math-&#xD;
ematical ones, all alike incomprehensible to the irrational na-&#xD;
tures themselves ;" which had the effect to hush up good John&#xD;
for the time ; and while they were all laughing, Jan said, -.&#xD;
"What do you think, Sonsie?"&#xD;
"I think you talk as clear as mud, sir."&#xD;
"Thank you," replied he, slipping into the place next her;&#xD;
&#xD;
"and now, then, the next point we'll make will be a good sup..&#xD;
per. What shall you and I have ? Shall we order a chicken&#xD;
and trofles, or kidneys, champagne sauce, or potted shrimps,&#xD;
or -"&#xD;
"An is it supper, sir, an' the clock goin' the half hour past&#xD;
eleven; I'd be grateful for a sup of milk, though, if I might&#xD;
get it-"&#xD;
Jan laid down the bill.&#xD;
"Better take the Croton without the chalk, Sonsie : that is a&#xD;
general rule ; but I'll order some for you. I suppose they've&#xD;
got a farm of their own, these St. James folks, so we may get a&#xD;
pure article, and, apropos of milk, Peter and I are to examine&#xD;
some imported stock while we're here. Ydu remember that&#xD;
farm we overlooked from the up-pasture ? Well, I'm going to&#xD;
put some fine cattle upon that place."&#xD;
" Have you found a tenant, sir ?"&#xD;
"I have my eye upon one now, Sonsie"&#xD;
As he happened to be staring at Peebles, that young person&#xD;
remarked,&#xD;
"Thank you, sir. I am sure you do me too much honor.&#xD;
Cincinnatus went from the plow to the consulship, but I should&#xD;
be fearfully out of place on a farm, if you mean me."&#xD;
"You,"friend John ! Why you'd be feeding the cows Greek&#xD;
roots instead of cabbages. I referred to my mind's eye, which&#xD;
is, at this moment, in Roaring River, admiring an active, tight-&#xD;
built chap, who. is not afraid of any honest work."&#xD;
"A nice, healthy, hearty, young Irishman, then. Isn't he,&#xD;
sir? " asked Sonsie, laughing.&#xD;
"Well,,yes. He does happen to be, and I'm going to put a&#xD;
lot of Irish cows on the farm, too. There's a drove of Kyloes.&#xD;
just over down the bay. I want some of them. I'll bet a hat&#xD;

well. The master of the mills had a packsof the little, short,&#xD;
thick, black creatures, tough and bold, and wild-eyed; they're&#xD;
no milker's butt, only fit for beef."&#xD;
"Well, Sonsie, my new tenant will make his own beef: He&#xD;
is going to farm on enlightened principles; -and he has got a&#xD;
good backer. I must have a couple of Kerry cows. I wish I&#xD;
had cut my eye-teeth when I had the chance to get those at&#xD;
Blarney Castle ; three of them would give twenty-one gallons a&#xD;
day. That beats your Ayrshires all to finders, eh ! Peter"-&#xD;
"Your statements are hollow, sir r as hollow as a pumpkin;&#xD;
give me Guernsey cows for my dairy  or Alderneys - or my&#xD;
noble Ayrshires - who milk pure cream."&#xD;
"You are befogged, Peter, ny boy - the little Kerrys sup-&#xD;
ply all the conditions : in the'first place, they only cost about&#xD;
five pounds; and they eat like women, just a sup and a taste of&#xD;
something nice and delicate. I'll have a Kerry bull anyhow -&#xD;

searchin' for us wid a lantern.'&#xD;
Though Sonsie laughed at the story and Jan's Dutch-Irish&#xD;
brogue, he helped himself to plenty of occupation, because she&#xD;
set at him to know all about lightning-bugs; what they were&#xD;
made of, and how they did it; and the young gentleman soon&#xD;
got out of his depth, and called Chris to his aid.&#xD;
Sonsies enjoyed her sprightly way of picking up the subject;&#xD;
explairfing that this is -one of the exceptions in the insect-world,&#xD;
where the male usually absorbs all the beauty; for 'tis the fe-&#xD;
male who goes glancing about like a pale-blue "star, 6n sum-&#xD;
mer-nights, and her mate is heavy, brown, and dull. She would&#xD;
ask no questions; Chris's eyes were so weary, and her good.&#xD;
nature so evidently an effort ; and Bertha also, who knew every&#xD;
change in her friend's mobile face and -her flexible voice, and&#xD;
had grown used to watch her in the weary days, when she was&#xD;
creeping slowly back from the Dark River into health, and&#xD;
who loved her with a twofold love.&#xD;
Bertha came and laid her hands upon the talker's shoulders,&#xD;
and said it was time to go to rest. They'had to' wait for the&#xD;
elevator to come down: the team was out, and the slow-nov-&#xD;
ing monster creaked and grumbled as if tired out. And Chris&#xD;
leaned absently against the foldingdoor which shuts off the&#xD;
great breakfast-room from the' oface.haill. Three gentlemen&#xD;
were at a table w4itri. They had'Ifihished their supper and&#xD;
were talking. Though they were too far offfor Chris to catch,&#xD;
the words, sorethingin theones stirred her agreeably-- two&#xD;
dissiilar voices, both deep~adnih;°but in the-sub-tones of&#xD;
the one who spoke most there was a certain glad ring:a sort&#xD;
of eager, expectant vibration  which set her thoughts roving,&#xD;
a cosyi quiet room   a  ticking cocak in' t corner - a&#xD;
little mother, and a lovely child ; " and listen,- these three,&#xD;
&#xD;
or four hummed notes - that tenor whistle ! Those sound so&#xD;
familiar.&#xD;
They rose and walked on together. As they passed the door,&#xD;
Chris caught a few words. The voice was" different, and the&#xD;
words were not much ; only an old Spanish proverb she had&#xD;
heard a thousand times: "'Tis not the frock which makes the&#xD;
friar."  Sonsie, whose arm was around her waist, felt the thrill&#xD;
which passed over her darling's slender figure.  She saw her&#xD;
raise her head like a startled deer, and noticed the paleness and&#xD;
the shade together, "as if' lilies had been mixed with violets,"&#xD;
which swept her cheek ; and she tightened her clasp, and whis-&#xD;
pered some soft words, with her deepening eyes seeking the&#xD;
depths of the great wistful brown ones, which prayed for help.&#xD;
The talkers passed on through the:length of the long break-&#xD;
fast-parlor; and out at the door, into the hall, and mounted&#xD;
the wide staircase. And Chris lost the sound of their foot-falls&#xD;
on the thick carpet; and our party ascended in the elevator to&#xD;
their apartments, after agreeing upon the breakfast hour; and&#xD;
Sonsie took Chris, who walked in a waking dream, to her room,&#xD;
)and placed her in the great chair.&#xD;
"I'll be back in a trice, Miss Chris," said she; "lay yer&#xD;
pretty head back' and shut the poor tired eyes I love to see&#xD;
bright, till nI'm here again.&#xD;
She flew down the stairs to the office, and walked straight&#xD;
up to the desk. She had time to count all the bls,: and spell&#xD;
the names 'on the trunks standing in piles, ad exxire the&#xD;
faces passing to and frd, before hebusy clerk waa estlto at-&#xD;

Sonsie listening, got, n  information, aid, returned to Chris,'&#xD;
who looked expectantly in her eyes as she appeared.&#xD;
"It was like .a visionwwasn't it, mraguorneen, but 'tis not&#xD;

and forget it,. anal bring the sweetness back to yer marlin' face;&#xD;

something nice, till, se falls asleep."&#xD;
Sonsie talked on, while she took care of her lady, who was&#xD;
thankfl to let herself be attended, and cuddled, and who&#xD;
folded herhands be eath her cheek, and shut her eyes, and the&#xD;
girl took up an open. volume she -found .upon the table, and&#xD;
read aloud, -&#xD;
"Nay, none but children&#xD;

But violets!deadviolets, methinks'&#xD;
I could live forever on a bank of violets,&#xD;
Or diepmost happy there,"&#xD;
She put the book hurriedly from her, and Chris hoped that&#xD;
the half-gloom would hide the tears which would filter through&#xD;
her closed lids.                           -&#xD;
" It is very very late, good Sonsie," said she presently; "you&#xD;
mpst get to bed.- I am going to sleep, so wish me pleasant&#xD;
dreams.'&#xD;
Sonsie took the hand reached out to her, and, dropped upon&#xD;

God accepteth thy works.' Isent that a good bit of reading ,&#xD;
now?"&#xD;
"Yes, Sonsie," answered Chris, quietly; 'but the summing up&#xD;
of the subject is left out of your quotation. If it were all there,&#xD;
you'd find the rest of it read, 'Vanity of vanities, saith the&#xD;
preacher, all is vanity.' "&#xD;
" Miss Chris," said Sonsie, much troubled, "is there not com-&#xD;
fort in the Bible for all, and. help for all, and strength for&#xD;
all?"&#xD;
"Yes, indeed," answered Chris, very sorry for having spoken&#xD;
out the desolation she felt. " Oh, yes, Sonsie, and it is only me&#xD;
who am disturbed to-night, and not in a fit frame to receive the&#xD;
precious consolations. I am going to try to be, though, before&#xD;

"Why not go to Stewart's 'at once?" 'asked Sabrina, "where&#xD;
they keep every thing."&#xD;
Because," replied Mrs. Walsingham, "they'have such an&#xD;
unpleasant, indifferent, supercilious set of attendants there. I&#xD;
went, last year, to buy a large bill, while I was ordering Pus.&#xD;
sey Ashcroft's trousseau (our little Texas friend, you know),&#xD;
and I asked for the first thing on my list  a lace cape. Two&#xD;
clerks were conversing together, and I spoke twice before they&#xD;
even looked at me. Then one did turn, and stare up and down&#xD;
my graytravelling-dress, and coolly inform me, "they had none&#xD;
likely to suit me; none under fifty dollars!" and the fellow.&#xD;
presented his shoulder and the two brass buttons !in his back,'&#xD;
and'resumed the account of astreet brawl, which I had dar-&#xD;
ingly' interrupted. Quite quenched, I retreated to the glove-&#xD;
counter, andtook modestly a pair des gants, which I got tossed&#xD;
down before me after a couple of entreaties, and I tried the&#xD;
leather, and examined the number and maker's name."&#xD;
"Don't stretch 'those gloves that way, ma'am,if your please !''&#xD;
expostulated the clerk, in a tone of the deepest injury.&#xD;
"Absolutely extinguished, I dropped the hand-shoes and with.&#xD;
drew, thankful to get off with my head on my shoulders, and I'&#xD;
cut loose from Stewart's forever; and I know that mine is not&#xD;
a solitary case. Yes! I know it quite well. A lady who goes&#xD;
in that store in a plain dress has no chance at all, unless she&#xD;
is willing to be  snubbedandi takes joyfully contemptuous&#xD;
looks and supercilious. service, which I'm  quite' willing to&#xD;
admit! do.' not.  If I am about to spend' money, I like to&#xD;
leave 'it with agreeable, cheerful. people, 'who' are 'not too fine&#xD;
to attend to their duties, and who will, not glower at my clothes,&#xD;
and toss their goods about as if the sight of me was hateful, and&#xD;
my gunple inquiries a personal affront;",&#xD;
&#xD;
 Ah!" said Jan, reaching over to pat his mother's little .ew.&#xD;
elled hand, -"ah !L" there speaks the country importance.&#xD;
Our ladies of position, who are accuston'ed to have their say&#xD;
and their way at home, would not make very complaisant atoms&#xD;
of a city mass."&#xD;
"That's where your head is level," replied Peter- " Therets&#xD;
Zoe I It's all my farm is worth to walk the streets withher.&#xD;
She sputters and scolds, at me, if people jostle her, just as&#xD;
if nobody had a right to push along, when      she chooses to&#xD;
loiter. I expect every day I'll have to call out some= fellow&#xD;
who has stuck his foot through her skirt.  I assure you, :I-wilt&#xD;

Chris was arrived.; and John Peebles, who had been walking&#xD;
up and down the' office,-with a book inhis fingers, inspecting&#xD;
each cargo of humanity dumped by the industrious elevator,&#xD;
joined her at the door, hoping  for a nice chat- ;ibut she-was&#xD;
too perturbed in spirit tolafford him any satisfaction, and she&#xD;
scanned drearily the faces of the corners and goers, api4:the.&#xD;

of the great-drawing room, lingered 'in' her ears.  She. could not&#xD;

When John Peebles asked her why she did not eat the pigeon&#xD;
he ordered for' her breakfast, she roused with some effort from&#xD;
her reverie and answered him,&#xD;
"But low was he laid in a grassy grave t"&#xD;
and the mystified young scholar stared with " eyes glaring&#xD;
wildly," like Sintram's, while the vibrations of the harp-strings&#xD;
still resounded.&#xD;
Sabrina, whose breakfasts were always of the simplest, came&#xD;
around, wrapped in her fleecy violet shawl, and placed her&#xD;
little flower-vase at Chris's elbow.,&#xD;
"I picked them out of Zoe's breakfast-posey. She- doesn't&#xD;
care at all for heliotropes ; and do you know, dearest, the lady.&#xD;
kin declares she'll buy an evening dress the color of that cactus.&#xD;
blossom at her throat. I may not gainsay her, for Zoe would&#xD;
scarcely be Zoe without a trail of scarlet upon her hair, or a&#xD;
vivid robe, like the pomegranate which the flower-fairy trans.&#xD;
formed into a woman. Will you come to Vanity Fair, sweet,&#xD;
and help us buy pretties in the great bazaars?"&#xD;
'" I think -not," Chris hesitatingly replied. "I have promised&#xD;
to stay within doors this morning, and' at two o'clock I am&#xD;
to explore, the dens of the lions, with Mr. Peebles as Daniel,&#xD;
to carry the green umbrella, you know."&#xD;
As Sabrina did not know that Dr. Max was to come to the&#xD;
St. James at eleven, she could not understand the flickering&#xD;
blood in her friends .cheek, nor the unrestful, expectant mood&#xD;
which glimmered all over her.&#xD;
Jan had got hold of Sonsie Eagan hours ago. They' were&#xD;
both early risers, and he came across her, in hat and mantle,&#xD;
walking swiftly through the upper hall.&#xD;
"Whither away so fast, Sonsie?"&#xD;
" I'm going to church, sir," she answered, striding on.&#xD;

&#xD;
 "Let me go too. I want to pray a little."&#xD;
It seemed, though, that he wished more to arrange his day&#xD;
to suit his plans than to offer many, petitions.  He hoped&#xD;
to get Sonsie's company in the park, or at Greenwood, or&#xD;
some other quiet place; but the young girl had views of her&#xD;
own, and his wishes went for nothing. But after amonent's&#xD;
thought she opened wide her Irish eyes, and said impul-&#xD;
sively,&#xD;
" I wish you'd throw away these notions, sir, and come alng&#xD;
with me. 1'll take you where you'll get good."&#xD;
"Very well, Sonsie. You know I am willing to follow your&#xD;
leading -in that direction, I mean ; and I'l promise to, trot&#xD;
by your side all day, like your faithful frisky Flirt, or, Rainbow,&#xD;
the Egyptian, if you will engage me your evening,. and we'll go&#xD;
down to Wallack's and see a play, with the glorious Lester&#xD;
himself for 'hero.' "&#xD;
"And is it a the-a-tre, sir.?"&#xD;
" Yes, Sonsie, a choice good one, Splendid acting, gorgeous&#xD;
dresses, perfect scenery, and real standard plays. I know for&#xD;
sure that you will like it, and I appetite beforehand the pleas-&#xD;
ure I shall enjoy in watching you. I hate to takestiff, wooden&#xD;
girls, who can't cry or laugh ; but you, Sonsie ! I'm certain you&#xD;
will enter into the counterfeited semblance and count it real."&#xD;
" But, whisper, Mr. Vedder -could ye take me to see an&#xD;
Irish play, somewheres ?"&#xD;
" Oh yes," replied Jan readily, "there's Arrah na Pogue on at&#xD;
the Olympic. We'll go there. I declare, Sonsie, I wish every-&#xD;
body knew what they want and why they want it as thoroughly&#xD;
as you do. You are such a relief, positively a refreshment,&#xD;
after the namby-pamby things, who think they admire -yes,&#xD;
they're almost sure they do -but don't know either -perhaps&#xD;
really -becalmed, befogged in uncertainty. You. Milesians&#xD;

"Indeed I do. Ireland is the land of the bards. The&#xD;
national airs are full of poesy and religion. They are the&#xD;
echoes of a soul soft and plaintivei Their love-songs are redo-&#xD;

" Thank you, Mr. Vedder," Sonsie replied, smiling. "I'm glad&#xD;
you think so well of me pert ways, because a 'cauld word is&#xD;
as bad as a stab to an Irish heart ;' -and when ye've come until&#xD;
the theatre, I'll be sure to be - livened. up wid the life of it,&#xD;

ening into violet. "I think this might be the place where&#xD;
the little crossing-sweeper found her mother. - See t&#xD;
"Tis the wide-open doors of a church,&#xD;
And she softly crept into the deep sheltered porch ;&#xD;
and oh, Mr. Vedder ! it makes my heart beat. . There now:!&#xD;
"She heard the solemn organ, and the voices of the choir."&#xD;
Mark ! how sweet that music sounds ! When I came in hither&#xD;
by mesel in the gloaming yestereen,, I was creeping all ,over&#xD;
and chilly. I seemed to see the poor child lying down there in&#xD;
yon corner. Ah, let us hasten, sir ; my heart aches wid her.&#xD;
sorrow !"&#xD;
They walked a couple of miles, and looked into a score or&#xD;
so of shop-windows, and were very merry, when they came into&#xD;
the tea-room and jined their party.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
CHRIS'S DAY AMONG THE LIONS.&#xD;
ND so they all went out, and left our Chris dreaming&#xD;
over the voice and the song; and she sat down to the&#xD;
piano in the great drawing-room and played out her&#xD;
dream, and the strain rose insensibly into the melody .she had&#xD;
heard, and the words thrilled through her lips with the keen en-&#xD;
joyment one has in recalling pleasant hai-monies, and she&#xD;
sang, -&#xD;
" Sing-bey ! sing ho, for that land of flowers,"&#xD;
running down onto C sharp, and smiled to herself at the faith-&#xD;
ful copy she was rendering .of the unknown basso; and 2o!&#xD;
she heard a brisk clapping of hands, and "Bravo ! bravissimo !&#xD;
Mees Goldschmidt," and rose hastily to find Dr. Max at her&#xD;
elbow.&#xD;
" You also sing of Sintram's songs, and you also ' seek the&#xD;
bowers where the roses blow.'"&#xD;
" Oh, Dr. Max ! you were the singer then, to whom I listened&#xD;
this morning; I should rtot have feared to come in here, if I&#xD;
had known that."_&#xD;
Yes, Fraulein Creestabel, I was too impatient; I arrived&#xD;
too early to find you, and now I must hasten, indeed I can&#xD;
scarcely stop to sit: I hope you will come out with me immed-&#xD;
iately; I have some commission on my hands -a bequest to&#xD;
dispose of, and I beg your assistance and coperation."&#xD;
.Dr. Max paused at Ball &amp;amp; Black's, and said, " Let us&#xD;
enter here, Mees Goldschmidt, and look at the jewels."&#xD;
He walked down to a side-counter, and asked a question of&#xD;
the clerk, who brought out a box which he aid open upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
CHRIS'S DA Y AMONG THE LIONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
desk, -a bracelet of twelve sapphires, in massive setting of old&#xD;
yellow gold,. hinged upon diamonds. The Doctor examined&#xD;
them critically within, and frowned, bringing his 'yellow eye.&#xD;
brows together over his leonine eyes, which always clouded like&#xD;
the smoke topaz, when he was angry, or fired by emotion.&#xD;
" You have failed to obey my directions," said he ; " lordeed&#xD;
German text, and you have put it in Old English!"&#xD;
" You.told me Old English," replied the clerk, crossly ; " tisn't&#xD;
my fault if you don't know your own mind two days together.&#xD;
I did it exactly to your order, which I took down on a piece&#xD;
of paper and gave to the engraver 1"&#xD;
"You mistake, friend," said Max, "or you mis-state: produce&#xD;
your bit of paper to your confusion."&#xD;
"I can't hunt it up now. I know it is right, and youmay&#xD;
take it or leave it:- those are the proper letters for it, anyhow."&#xD;
"Have the goodness to mind your own business, and leave&#xD;
offering opinions upon my affairs till you're asked. Show me&#xD;
some plain gold rings."  He turned and walked back to Chris,&#xD;
who was watching him with the fascination her association of&#xD;
ideas gave him in her mind, and with Sintram's song floating&#xD;
about her, - Sintram the yellow-haired, composed and:stately.&#xD;
" Could das fraulein lend me ihr klein finger as a'sample. I&#xD;
must make a purchase," said he, reaching after what he; de-&#xD;
sired, with:business air. She extended her hand readily, in its&#xD;
rosy-gray glove, and he fitted it with a.slender circlet of ena-&#xD;
mel and gold, which he .pronounced "vara goot," and put&#xD;
away into his' vest pocket, "after paying the glowering elerk.&#xD;
" Now Mees Goldschmidt, I know you are an erthusiast for&#xD;
art. I remember quite well that I found you and Herk Green-&#xD;
veldt adoring a saint in his studio, a  cause yoti wore a&#xD;
much-daubed apron; I 'kno* yo   a     yourself the pic-&#xD;

tures. What if we were to go and look at some Flemish ones&#xD;
Goupil has to show."&#xD;
They passed a blind man on the pave grinding the most do-&#xD;
lorous of organs, and Dr.! Ma" dropped a bill into his hat, and&#xD;
he excused his charitable impulse, and ridiculed it by reciting&#xD;
Canning's "«Knife-Grinder," and then they were within the gas-&#xD;
lighted room alone together. After a purvey of the white stout-&#xD;
footed roadsters and the rough cart-horses and the sorrel colt,.&#xD;
and a- certain amount- of talk upon .the picture and the odd&#xD;
life the painter had elected to herself, they sat down on a&#xD;
bench, and Dr. Max took out the casket and laid it open on his&#xD;
knee.&#xD;
"There is a.story to that jewel,. Mees Goldschmidt," said he,&#xD;
pointing his finger at it. "I'd like to tell it you. You see the&#xD;
setting is varc. old ; and the sapphires are the. color. of the sky&#xD;
when the, moon is-full. My. father, whom I -never saw" (a&#xD;
shadow and .a kindling light flitted through his. smoke-topaz&#xD;
eyes),-"it' may be that it will be -for me to. speak openly to&#xD;
you of that some day.- My father gave them-to my mother ; he&#xD;
brought them from beyond ,the seas ; there were'ear-rings and&#xD;
brooch to match ; those my mother commissioned me to give&#xD;
t my friend Otho, with her love. He was like a son to her ; so&#xD;
dear, that I got jealous sometimes.. She said' they were for his&#xD;
wife, and I put them into his hand just before we reached Rosen-&#xD;
bloom that Christmas time, when I was so blessed as to dance&#xD;
with Mees Goldschmidt at the great party... I remember quite&#xD;
well how he looked when he took. them, - prouder than I ever&#xD;
saw, him, exulting, arrogant almost. He seized them, like a&#xD;
lawful 'spoil of his bow and spear, and hid there away in his&#xD;
breast. I remember also wondering if he was in love. Close&#xD;
friends' as we are, though, I dared not ask the question. I&#xD;
found afterwards that Otho the Doctor was wedded to his dry&#xD;
&#xD;
275&#xD;
&#xD;
bones, therefore let him alone. He's a glorious old fellow'; but&#xD;
somehow he fails to see the beauty of God's fairest work, so I&#xD;
suppose my mother's gems must rest, shorn of their beams, in&#xD;
dull darkness."&#xD;
Chris stooped to pick up the tin view-horn which had rolled&#xD;
off her lap, and she steadied her face and resumed' her listening&#xD;
attitude, with her eyes upon the carpet, and her small teeth&#xD;
compressing her bloodless lips.&#xD;
" My mother " (he spoke very lovingly the words ; she noticed&#xD;
that, even through her agitation),-"my mother bestowed this&#xD;
upon me also then. 'Take'it, Max,' said she. "I was a happy girl&#xD;
when I first put it on, and I should like you to give it to a&#xD;
good, true, pure maiden, and tell her your mother bid you do&#xD;
it.' 'I believe prayers are answered, 'and I have prayed that the&#xD;
good God will point out the -right one. I am sure it will fit&#xD;
your wrist; so sure, and so hopeful 'that you will permit me to&#xD;
carry out my mother's wishes, that I have ventured to have your&#xD;
name engraved beneath hers."'&#xD;
Chris suffered him- to lift the hand, which he touched cour-&#xD;
teously, and fasten the clasp upon her arm, hardly knowing&#xD;
what- she did. The mention of Otho, his possession of the&#xD;
match jewels, which- were for his wife, her happiness, her&#xD;
misery,,her conflict, and her loveless future, overwhelnedher,&#xD;
and .she sank= back pale, breathless. Dr. Max again read her&#xD;
emotions to suit himself, and read them wrong.&#xD;
"Now, Mees' Goldschmidt, let me finish my story."  He&#xD;
smiled; and with his eyes dropped upon the enpty Casket, of&#xD;
which he kept playing the lock with Iusy fingers, "My mother&#xD;
bid me also marry my love if I could get he to wear the brace-&#xD;
let. I'm sure youi like obedient boys, dq you not  I wish&#xD;
with all my heart to obey n y' good mother. Wnit you, have&#xD;
the little ring P it precisely fits your finger, you know. "&#xD;

- He was deeply earnest, beneath his whimsical wooing, and&#xD;
his heart throbbed with strong love-power; but Chris did&#xD;
not see it; did not think about him, There was no room in&#xD;
her soul for a new love.&#xD;
"Take off the bracelet, Dr. Max," said she, passionately push-&#xD;
ing it with her slender fingers; "it hurts me ! I cannot wear it&#xD;
indeed ! I was dreaming while you put it on; do not speak&#xD;
to me of love. You cannot know how impossible it is for me&#xD;
to care for you1"&#xD;
Dr. Max studied eagerly her tumultuous eyes with their swift&#xD;
thoughts, and noted the startled wild-deer glance, seeking&#xD;
escape; and his face saddened a little.&#xD;
" Ah, it is too sudden ! You think me presumptuous ;&#xD;
you consider me a stranger. I had forgotten you did not&#xD;
know how long your -image ,has been mine. I could tell&#xD;
you every word you uttered .that evening ; I can recall, every&#xD;
light, airy, graceful motion, every smile on your swiftly-&#xD;
changing face : but you did not know that; I was but the ac.-&#xD;
quaintatce of an evening. Mees Goldschmidt, let me wait&#xD;
a little; only wear my mother's bracelet, and let me hope."&#xD;
He kissed the ring, and returned it to his pocket. "I shall&#xD;
not forget whose little finger you have clasped," said he.&#xD;
" Dr. Max," began Chris, " I haven't any love to give you ;&#xD;
I cannot wear this ! I am not the maiden your mother bade&#xD;
you seek ! Oh, no. .I am very unhappy  Why couldn't you&#xD;
be my friend ?" she added, half angrily. "I want good, hon-&#xD;
est friends so much: I don't want lovers ! I've got my life&#xD;
marked out ; I've given my soul to art, and music, and charity.&#xD;
I could have enjoyed your friendship so much ; but love&#xD;
you ! marry you ! Oh, no l Never!.&#xD;
Determined not to break down, and give the tears way,&#xD;
&#xD;
CIjRIS'S DA Y AMONG THE LIONS.            277&#xD;
which were brimming her eyes, she continued with a half&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"'Nay, seek another bride, I pray :&#xD;
Most fair are the maidens of Naples Bay.'&#xD;
'Tis your own song, you lsnow, Dr. Max. I see that you think&#xD;
me trifling, and wanting in heart. I am noti only it is of no&#xD;
use, sir: please forget that you ever uttered the words, and be&#xD;
my friend. Cannot true women have true men for friends,&#xD;
without marrying them ? "&#xD;
She held out her hand,.and looked in his face with searching,&#xD;
wistful eyes.&#xD;
"Yes, truly I believe so, indeed, Mees Goldschmidt. I see I was&#xD;
mistaken: I see.it so plainly, that I will not pain you any&#xD;
more," he replied sorrowfully; " but you are, after all, the 'good&#xD;
pure maiden,' and you ,shall not refuse to wear my mother's&#xD;
gift; that would hurt me too much : and let me believe that&#xD;
you sometimes think about the clumsy fellow .who did not&#xD;
know how to woo you."&#xD;
He kissed the hand he held, and they passed out into the&#xD;
street together. lie left her in the great drawing-room of the&#xD;
St. James, with parting words so kind, and tender, and hearty,&#xD;
that when he walked away, Chris felt that- she had cut loose&#xD;
from a friendly soul, who might have sheltered hers -- and was&#xD;
drifting alone.. Peebles found her on the sofa, with clasped.&#xD;
hands, and, suffering, colorless face, when he came to take her&#xD;
into the dens of tlie lions. . She scarcelyaknew where she was&#xD;
when she entered Besoixm street, and saw on a great white sign&#xD;
board the name, in black letters, of the firm she sought.;&#xD;
"Slightem &amp;amp; Slash."  She got her ideas together, and grasped&#xD;
firmly her little roll of manuscript.&#xD;
"You stop out here, good, Mr. Peebles, please," said she,&#xD;
wetting her lips nervously. " I'd rather face my fate without&#xD;

witnesses;" and leaving her escort in the outer room, she&#xD;
pushed open the green-baize door, to which the clerk with a&#xD;
pen behind each ear marshalled her; and she stood in the&#xD;
presence of the great Mr. Slightem, and extended her hand and&#xD;
her letter.&#xD;
"Oh! " he exclaimed, running his eyes down the page, and&#xD;
then over his visitor. " Good day, miss. I am very busy, but&#xD;
I shall try to give you a few moments."  He motioned Chris&#xD;
to an old horse-hair chair, which had seen better days, and sat&#xD;
down in front of her, -asif she was a dreadful bore,-and&#xD;
shuffled his papers, and his eyes said plainly that he wished&#xD;
she would take herself off.&#xD;
" I regret to interrupt you, sir ; but I don't see how I can&#xD;
well help it, and I will be as brief as I can. I wish to con-&#xD;
sult you about bringing out my book, or rather, to get some&#xD;
information as to how authors go to work to publish."&#xD;
"A novel'?"      -&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"We don't publish any novels, miss; we only take transla-&#xD;
latiois from the German, and scientific works ; and we have&#xD;
such a surfeit of those, that we"keep circulars of refusal ready,&#xD;
to fill out for applicants."'&#xD;
"Perhaps you will be kind enough to reconinend me to&#xD;
some other publisher, who does publish novels."&#xD;
" I could name some to you, but I couldn't request them to&#xD;
publish your book; and if I did,; they'd ask me if I saw any&#xD;
thing green in them. Mr. Slighten applied a finger to his eye,&#xD;
with a gesture rude boys are fond of using. If you will&#xD;
take my advice, you will put- up your manuscript, and go&#xD;
home: not one in a hundred of the books published ever&#xD;
pay.&#xD;
"I know a good many must pay, sir; because we arev a na&#xD;

&#xD;
' tion of readers, and new books are all the time being issued ;&#xD;
and, if it were a. losing business, publishers would soon aban-&#xD;
don it."&#xD;
Mr. Slightem laughed sardonically.&#xD;
" You think your book will be the exception to the rule, of&#xD;
course. They all think that."&#xD;
"I do believe it will sell, sir," replied Chris, firmly.' "I have&#xD;
had it carefully read by good critics, just such as read other&#xD;
books, and their judgment is so favorable that I am determined&#xD;
to get it out."&#xD;
Another laugh.&#xD;
" Partial friends ! of course they praise. It is really odd&#xD;
how anxious everybody is :to get a little fame."&#xD;
" I think I can command spme good fair notices from the.&#xD;
Press."                     -&#xD;
"That does not make any difference."&#xD;
"I have some friends, who will help to push the book."&#xD;
" That won't amount to any thing."&#xD;
" Pray, sir, what does sell books ?" asked Chris, flashing&#xD;
up.&#xD;
" I don't know -- they sell themselves.; but this is certain"-&#xD;
nearly all publishers have determined not to* take up any new&#xD;
authors."&#xD;
"How are new authors to get introduced to the public, Mr.&#xD;
Slightem ?"&#xD;
"I can't tell, I'm sure. One thing is certain, -booksellers&#xD;
have got to live."&#xD;
"Will you read my story ?"&#xD;
" I'd as soon take a dose of medicine as read a novel ! not&#xD;
myself, of course. If you still insist, I'll have it read. If I&#xD;
should peruse all the manuscripts which are thrust upon me,&#xD;
I should not have time to eat my dinner. If you had come&#xD;

unrecommended, I would not have bothered with you ; but to&#xD;
oblige my old friend Noble, I'll have your manuscript examined;&#xD;
but I can't give you the least encouragement."&#xD;
"Very well, sir," said Chris, rising; "I'll not keep you any&#xD;
'longer, from your dinner, nor will I trouble you with my story.&#xD;
Perhaps I ought to say, I thank you for your politeness."&#xD;
She:walked away too angry to be disheartened. Mr. Slight-&#xD;
em took up his work before her back was turned, and left her&#xD;
to find-her way out by herself.&#xD;
"We must look further, good Daniel; so shoulder your faith-&#xD;
ful green umbrella, and lead the way. He glowers and sighs,&#xD;
and I can guess the cause, but who's obliged to spell his&#xD;
'hums and haws ?'" said she, as she turned the corner of&#xD;
Besom Street.&#xD;
When they entered the store of Mr. G. Hazel Fortune, on&#xD;
Broadway, she was rather red-,in the face; a trifle tremulous in&#xD;
the pulse, but prepared for any disagreeable line of conduct the&#xD;
Hazel Fortunes might display towards her, in her defenceless&#xD;
character of "new- author."&#xD;
The young proprietor was talking with a customer, but&#xD;
turned instantly when his clerk approached him, and saidain a&#xD;
low, respectful voice, "A lady to speak. with you, sir; "and ad-&#xD;
vanced with a friendly smile on his clear-cut sagacious face,&#xD;
and invited her to be seated on his own sofa, and, sat down&#xD;
himself beside her, as if he had thousands of years at his com-&#xD;
mand, and she was welcome to any. number of them. He&#xD;
heard all she had to say, and helped her out with pertinent&#xD;
suggestions and remarks, showed her some contracts, and ex-&#xD;
plained the modus o erandi clearly and fully, and looked at&#xD;
her through his, glasses while he talked, turning over the manu-&#xD;
script in his slender white hands, and smiling at her eagerness;&#xD;
and even though she was intent upon her business, she observed&#xD;
&#xD;
that his eyes were large, and clear, and hazel, and that his&#xD;
mouth was pleasant and cordial,. his mustache silky brown,&#xD;
and his clothes handsome, and easy-fitting.&#xD;
"It is your first book, I perceive," said he; " I hope truly that&#xD;
you will be successful.. I will certainly do all in my power for&#xD;
you: the "manuscript shall be read and pronounced upon in a&#xD;
day or two. I sometimes dabble in ink a little myself aadI&#xD;
understand your fondness for your dream pet."&#xD;
Mr. Fortune rose when Chris rose, and walkedeb yhe&#xD;
side to the door, talking easily; and the last she saw of his&#xD;
'     agreeable face was a friendly smile, as she returned his parting&#xD;
bow; and leaving his presence, she felt a glow of gratitude&#xD;
for the manner in which he had conducted the interview, his&#xD;
absolute politeness, his appearance of attentive interest, and the&#xD;
ultimate success of her project became for the time &amp;amp; secondary&#xD;
consideration.&#xD;
Suffice it to say, that Mr. Hazel Fortune did all he promised,&#xD;
and more; and C aris was made happy by a letter from him be-&#xD;
fore the close ofthe third day, saying that her manuscript was&#xD;
accepted; and it was brought out in due time by "the Royal&#xD;
George" (as Chrs always called him afterward),'in splendid&#xD;
style-; real illustrations, not sketches of a woman in flounces-&#xD;
all coarse hard lines, nor two men and a table, nor a chair and&#xD;
a grand piano, which might do duty for an almanac or a fashion-&#xD;
book with equal facility, but real pictures I-which meant some=&#xD;
thing, and enriched and beautified the story ; and such letter-&#xD;
press; on such tinted paper, ah l the very sight and touch of it&#xD;
were positive pleasures.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
SONSIE''S DAY, AND A LETTER FROM, CAPTAIN SLOCUM.&#xD;
AN 'and she took a stage to' the old Museum, and then&#xD;
they walked through street after street, .narrow and&#xD;
narrower, till, they cane to an alley, so choked with&#xD;
old tottering houses, old iron, old rags, old bones, old withered&#xD;
women, and old, skinny, half-naked children, that Jan~ stood&#xD;
still.&#xD;
"Sonsie, you shall go no further into this horrible den," said&#xD;
he.&#xD;
She laughed.'&#xD;
"Ah! whist, Mr. Vedder, take it aisy --I used to live here&#xD;
in this very house ; and, by the same" token, this is the very old&#xD;
rickety staircase that Denny and me pattered up o'nights after&#xD;
me: sweeping the dirty crosses the livelong day. It bore us&#xD;
poor weary children those times, and as it did not tumble down&#xD;
yet (small loss though if it did), I suppose 'twill bear the pair&#xD;
of us this day.'. Coom now, Mr. Vedder, and let a gentleman&#xD;
see the first home the EEagans found in America."&#xD;
The way was' so dark as they ;mounted that she seized his&#xD;
hand and led him on through narrow, dirty passages, reeking&#xD;
with vile smells, slippery with' filth.&#xD;
"-I usen't to .have my place like this one; I scrubbed and&#xD;
cleaned, and me poor mother, she had a laugh those days like&#xD;
the merry tinkle of a water-brook. We'd just coomed then, and&#xD;
the joy and hope were not starved out of her ; but 'tis thrue&#xD;
for you, sir -- we niver. think so much of God's sunshine as in&#xD;
the moonless night-storms, and I didn't know ,the vally of me&#xD;

mother's smile till'twas quenched in tears ; and it came all too&#xD;
soon too; for me father could find no work, and he was a&#xD;
handsome, easy man, and the labor was hard on his careless&#xD;
heart anyhow, and we are all too proud to beg ; and they two&#xD;
died every day .t see the children peakin' and starvin'.  I&#xD;
was ,a wee girleen,' and Dennie only a clip of a boy,. but we -re-&#xD;
member all those times; and often prate over them together.&#xD;
Dennie's a good lad, Mr. Vedder. Ah, wisha ! but these steps&#xD;
is the treacherous villains. I wonder who is in the old place&#xD;
now!&#xD;
She-knocked smartly with her firm fist on the farthest door,&#xD;
and a woman opened it a couple of inches and =stuck one eye.&#xD;
out. It wasn't much of herself she let be seen; but what did&#xD;
show looked so sly and wicked, and she was' so unwilling to&#xD;
let them in, answering their questions in a fat, wheezy growl,&#xD;
that Jan tried to pull Sonsie away, but she persisted.&#xD;
"I used to live here, good wife," said she ; "and I'll just look&#xD;
in for the sake of the old times."  She set her 'firm-shoulder&#xD;
against' the door, and, with a quick push, she shoved off the&#xD;
guardian angel and entered the -room.&#xD;
The wretched child the woman held was hollow-eyed, and&#xD;
half-asleep ; two others lay in an old wooden cradle with their&#xD;
eyes shut ; still another in the corner on the- bare floor; a fifth&#xD;
was tied by the hands to an iron bar, which stretched across,&#xD;
between the tottering walls, and a raw-hide lay on the floor&#xD;
suggestively near him. The woman was greasy and flabby,; and&#xD;
there was bread and meat in the cupboard, and a whiskey-jug&#xD;
on the- shelf, and bits of cheese scattered on the rickety table;&#xD;
but starvation was written all over the skeletons who. opened&#xD;
human eyes and stared at them. And a feeble cry in the corner&#xD;
caught Sonsie's attention. She thought at first it was a. cat, but&#xD;
a stir among the rubbish impelled her to hurry and lift a rag&#xD;

from the heap, and a little mite of a purple baby!. A da old,&#xD;
hydd'y-                                -d'&#xD;
perhaps, and only life enough in its tiny heart to suffer.&#xD;
" Augh ! but this is the divel's den in me old place," said&#xD;
Sonsie, whose eyes grew deep, and whose face blanched to clear&#xD;
marble. "Mr. Jan!" she began in a high key. Jan turned sud.&#xD;
dentureddud&#xD;
deny and gave her a look; she stopped instantly. There had&#xD;
been such unwillingness in the female to permit any looking&#xD;
about, that his curiosity was roused and he put his head through&#xD;
an inner door. It was a terrible sight I a. dead woman lay on&#xD;
dirty bed, and a poor crippled boy crouched in a heap as far&#xD;
off as he could get, but gazing with scared eyes upon the still&#xD;
figure, so full of terror for his childish breast; and so wretched,&#xD;
scared, and hopeless was he in his filth and rags, that Jan turned&#xD;
sick at the sight of him; and the shrinking terror he showed at&#xD;
the opening of the door was painfully hinting,' and Jan read a&#xD;
life in it which filled .lim with indignation.&#xD;
You have a large family," said he, turning quietly to the&#xD;
woman, who stealthily 'watched him.&#xD;
Yes, sir, a large one indeed, sir," she whined. "I'm in great&#xD;
trouble! my poor children here are down with the fever, and&#xD;
the little-dear, in yonder, I took in off the streets last night, and&#xD;
she died on me not an hour ago; and I've nobody to fetch any&#xD;
help, and I don't know what I'm to do, I'm sure. I'm as poor&#xD;
as a cat, and any little help you can give me, I'd bless you for."&#xD;
"You drop your babies about rather promiscuously, don't&#xD;
you?" asked Jan, pointing to the mite Sonsie had picked up&#xD;
and was holding in her arms, while she faced the woman with&#xD;
eyes and manner full of fire and passion --no trace of fear any.&#xD;
where. Jan did not wait to make up his mind; he felt sure they&#xD;
had got within one of the dens where helpless children are left&#xD;
to be slowly got rid of. -And he looked at Sonsie and decided&#xD;
upon his course of action at once. The woman also scanned&#xD;
&#xD;
SONSIE'S DA 1'.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
her fresh face and full figure, rubbing her cheek with the cor-&#xD;
ner of her apron, and there was murder in her hateful eyes--&#xD;
the death that cometh up out of the pit.&#xD;
I'll see that you are cared for," said he. " Come, Sonsie;&#xD;
you've looked over the place and its inhabitants ; let us go!"&#xD;
"Ill take this poor bit along with me, sir, I think."&#xD;
Before he had time to answer, the cripple had crawled to his&#xD;
feet, braving the woman, who glared and shook her fist at him,&#xD;
and reached stealthily behind her for a whip on the wall.&#xD;
"Do not' leave us, good gentleman! do- not ; she kills us all&#xD;
the time. Oh! open the door and take us out with you; she's&#xD;
not our mother ; we are not brothers and sisters. Oh, pity us,&#xD;
we have suffered so much : look at my face - these scars, these&#xD;
blows."&#xD;
" Get out, you ungrateful wretch ! shut your mouth ; do&#xD;
you know what that is ?"&#xD;
The child glanced at the whip with despair' in his eyes.&#xD;
"I can no more than die ; and if you refuse to help me, and&#xD;
yon girl with the brave face. Ah, you can be sorry; for your&#xD;
eyes weep. Don't let her strike - oh 1"&#xD;
It was too late ; for a heavy blow from the -raw-hide felled&#xD;
him to the ground, and Jan flew upon the greasy wretch and&#xD;
twisted the weapon from her hand.&#xD;
" Are you afraid, Sonsie?" asked 'he.&#xD;
"No, sir ; there's been beating' and starving enough here: I'll&#xD;
not leave the place till we carry these poor babes along with&#xD;
us!"&#xD;
Jan threw up the window and shouted "police," and Sonsie&#xD;
set her back against the door, through which the woman tried to&#xD;
escape.&#xD;
"Bide where ye are, till ye get lave!" said 'she, looking her&#xD;
in the eye. "'I'm rnot afraid of yer fist, no, nor your broom&#xD;

" Yer time is up ! .there they come; the stairs are full of then.'&#xD;
She had no friends even among the poor and wicked ,about&#xD;
her, and the mob rushed on, and directly a couple of blue-coats&#xD;
were hustled into the scene ; and, as Sonsie said, her time was&#xD;
up.&#xD;
The cripple's story was clear. He had been there ever and&#xD;
ever so long ; the others came after him.; they were drugged and&#xD;
starved and beaten, She often told them they'd got to die, and&#xD;
Jan and the blue-coats had hard work to keep the, moboff the&#xD;
wretch, who cursed, and gnawed her hands in her impotent futry;&#xD;
and they dragged. her howling away, and Jan and Sonsie brought'&#xD;
the seven children in a carriage to Mr. Van Meter, in the&#xD;
New Bowery, and they told the. story, and waited till they saw&#xD;
them bathed and dressed and made comfortable ; and Sonsie&#xD;
said many sweet words to the little cripple (who kissed her&#xD;
hands and her {garments) ,:and promised to come on the morrow&#xD;
and see him; and she went to: the good matron,-and. begged her&#xD;
to-take, care of the " party babby," and Jan slipped a cheque&#xD;
for five hundred dollars into the hand of the hard-working&#xD;
issionary; andAfter hearing the ",friendless " sing, they hated&#xD;
away::&#xD;
"'Where shall we go now, Sonsie," asked Jan, when they had&#xD;
emerged upon Broadwaygand paused for a: good breath.&#xD;
" Let us go h9me, sire- I want to think a bit."&#xD;
She hardly spoke to him-all the way, though she fixed her&#xD;
eyes upon him often, and when they reached the St. James she&#xD;
followedjiim silently anto the great drawing-room; .then she&#xD;
tookthis hand and kissed it.,&#xD;
"4Oh, how good it is to see you those times ! The manhood&#xD;
sits so-grand. and beautiful in your two eyes !" And breaking&#xD;
downitteriy, she walked sobbing away, and ldeked herself into&#xD;
&#xD;
her room. Half an hour later; she- returned briskly, her coun-&#xD;
tenance clear and joyous, looking into the great drawing-&#xD;
rooml.&#xD;
" Ah, Mr.Vedder, sir ! I hardly thought I'd find you here, and&#xD;
I am glad you stopped a bit."''&#xD;
"Yes, Sonsie," said Jan, pushing off his cap, and pulling out&#xD;
his watch. "You've been gone  bless my soul!  I'd no idea&#xD;
it was so late-! almost dinner-time!"&#xD;
"I've come back to spake a little of me mind to you, sir,"&#xD;
said Sonsie, sitting down. "I've been thinking I should like to&#xD;
tell Mrs. Slocum about our day. She talked often of adopting&#xD;
some poor baby, and maybe her heart'd leadAher to pick up&#xD;
yon little bit ; sure, she'd a bonnie face in her clean frock."&#xD;
" Is that so? Wll, come ! we'll have up some paper and&#xD;
things, and indite an epistle here. It should be an enjoyable&#xD;
affair to write to your dictation, Sonsie."&#xD;
Jan stepped up by Sonsie's side, infront of the great mirror,&#xD;
and took off his cap, which' he had been rather uncivilly weare&#xD;
ing up to this period. "The Irish and' the Dutch," said 'he&#xD;
mischievously; "pretty good samples, ain't-we ?"&#xD;
" Yer extremely well -contrived,. Mr.Vedder, sir; aid to my&#xD;
eye, ye nivir looked so well as 'ye do' at this moment, for fa de-&#xD;
cent, clean-skinned gentleman; and sure 'tis a brave beginning&#xD;
that yer making entirely; and here comes the writing' things.&#xD;
Now sit down; please, and tell them all:tabout those children."&#xD;
Sonsie was well pleased with their joint production; and&#xD;
praised highly Jan's eloquent descriptions.  In due time there&#xD;
came a reply, which it 'is perhaps as Well to give while .'we are&#xD;
on the subject.&#xD;
"DEAR JAN,- We got your letter this morning I'd Juise like&#xD;

Why didn't you let the rabble chop her all to bits. Dulcet says&#xD;
my bark is a good deal worse= than my bite.. Well, never mind;&#xD;
let us drop her. We know the brimstone is a-biling. We'y'&#xD;
been holding matrimonial councils, off and on, all day most,&#xD;
tryin' to make up pur mind. just what we do want. Dulcet'&#xD;
eyes are as red as a rooster's coom, and her nose  well, I&#xD;
won't say what I was going to, because she's comic . But&#xD;
the upshot of the whole is this : Dulcet wants the baby. I&#xD;
kinder hanker after that pair of boys to make farmers- out of.&#xD;
Dulcet, she says, the two girls would be a nice investment; and&#xD;
then we calculated how that would leave the other girl all&#xD;
alone ; they'd been companions in misery, and it seemed al-&#xD;
most a pity to leave her out in the cold ; and that poor cripple&#xD;
that pleaded for their lives'so pretty --little helpless, sufferin'&#xD;
critter ; Them children allers does hey just such faces as you&#xD;
said,-patient and mild, and Jerusalem crickets. We'll have the&#xD;
batch, and hang the expense ! I haven't got a relation in the&#xD;
world I care a barn-cat for, except. Dolphy's folks, and they're&#xD;
a darned sight richer than I am. My wife, she's set her heart&#xD;
on fillin' up our house with them God-forsaken young ones,&#xD;
and I like her for it. Seven is a good number.. There was&#xD;
seven golden candlesticks, seven rams, seven lambs, seven he-&#xD;
goats, seven bullocks in the sacrifice ; and it says the whole&#xD;
assembly took counsel to keep seven days, and they kept them&#xD;
with gladness.  And Dulcet keeps saying a piece of poetry&#xD;
about the churchyard, and one that was gone -away somewheres ..&#xD;
and two was dead; and the little maid sticks to-'it that there&#xD;
was seyenof 'em yet. Yes, Jan, I want you to go right round&#xD;
to Van Meter, and tell him to express on the lot. I'll go the&#xD;
whole hog. My Jemimy! Dulcet, she's smart and spryfand I&#xD;
glory in her spunk ; and I am quite impatient to hear them&#xD;
call us papy and mammy."_&#xD;
&#xD;
Jan laid the affair before the party at dinner, and the two&#xD;
mamnias nimbly agreed to furnish suitable clothing for the little&#xD;
strangers, as their share in the pleasure. - (I suppose the tears&#xD;
they shed over Sonsie's heartbreaking relation didn't count.)&#xD;
And Lord &amp;amp; Taylor sold seven complete wardrobes, a.dozen of&#xD;
everything, as theirs. And extremely well-behaved and obliging&#xD;
was the gentlemanly clerk, while he assisted at the selection.&#xD;
And Sabrina brought corals, Zoe, knives and forks,'Chris, picture-&#xD;
books, and Sonsie was beginning to feel her poverty oppressive&#xD;
when Jan took her to a-toy-store, and bade her select for him;&#xD;
and she bought an estate, elegant mansion, barn-yards, stables,&#xD;
orchards, stock, and inhabitants. And Jan admired the white&#xD;
chip Lombardys, and said, "Are those our poplar trees that&#xD;
rear?" And in less than a week after Sonsie's day, the seven&#xD;
innocents were safely housed in Dulcet's home. The Celtic&#xD;
lassie was jubilant.  She sang in spirit, and exulted to Chris&#xD;
over the good commencement Mr. Veddpr was making&#xD;
"Yes, Sonsie, it was cleverly and noblydone. Jan  ,&#xD;
power for any thing he means to accomplish. He will  iss&#xD;
getting his will in most of his desires. He is of the kind peo-&#xD;
ple call 'successful men.'  And, by the way, I 'have a tresure&#xD;
to show you. I've been to-d4 in- the rarest place! -a wilder-&#xD;
ness of books ! Mr. Peebles took me into Nassau Street,.and&#xD;
there is a store down there where the volumes heap the coun-&#xD;
ters and shelves, and.pile the floor. I had such a good 'time!&#xD;
There was an illustrated Pilgrim's Progress and a Don Quix&#xD;
ote-- you never saw such beauties ! I only fetched -away this,"&#xD;
--(carefully dusting an odd volume of Walpole's Painters)&#xD;
-" and listen, Sonsie. You must know that Henry VIII.,&#xD;
whom your true church calls a Protestant reformer, and we&#xD;
heretics know to have been a cruel, sensual, hard-hearted myur-&#xD;
derer, had a sister, whom he married to his friend Charles Drar#&#xD;

adopt  long with his princess bride :&#xD;
" Cloth of gold, do not despise, though thou be matched with cloth of frieze ;&#xD;
Cloth of frieze, be not too bold, though thou be matched with cloth of gold."&#xD;
Sonsie sat with downcast mien for a long time after Chris&#xD;
shut the book, and when she went away to her room she mur-&#xD;
mured, "Delicacy, ---culture," and she shook her head more&#xD;
absolutely than ever.&#xD;

HRIS sat in the front of the box, at Wallack's, with&#xD;
John Peebles besideher, and Bertha in the other&#xD;
chair. At the- last moment, Zoe had made up her&#xD;
mind to go and hear the serenaders, and Peter, well pleased to&#xD;
have, her to himself, had carried her off in triumph, charging&#xD;
Peebles to see carefully after leis party.  Sabrina, who had&#xD;
"bound up her curls " as did Armida,. " and put some flowers&#xD;
among them,-as jewels might be, put upon gold, and added a&#xD;
rose or two to the lilies of her bosom,"-.Sabrina looked fair&#xD;
and pure as her namesake when she rose from her coral-paven&#xD;
bed to assist the shepherds. Bertha.seemed quietly happy. An-&#xD;
other letter from Chandos had followed them, and she read it&#xD;
the last thing before leaving the St. James, and on the third&#xD;
page he had said, "Give my love to Bertha."  So she was all in&#xD;
tune to make the most out ofc" Rosedale."&#xD;

upon her wrist. The bracelet of sapphires were speaking to her&#xD;
with Max's voice, and her thoughts were busy about him; busy&#xD;
among the looks and words she had got_ in the great parlor.&#xD;
She was thinking of the love, and protection, and care she&#xD;
had turned her back upon. There was a rustle and commotion&#xD;
in the stall below them; and which was also at their side, a&#xD;
waft of sweet odors, and Sabrina, who looked through the lat-&#xD;
tice, uttered an exclamation. Belle Brandon, accompanied by&#xD;
Henriquez Zambrano, and his sister Dolores, had entered, and&#xD;
were getting placed, arranging their drapery, and so on. Belle&#xD;
was enveloped in soft azure satin and swan's-down, and was&#xD;
bewitching and purring and creamy. And Dolores flashed her&#xD;
Spanish eyes, and nodded and smiled to her acquaintance, and&#xD;
appealed constantly to ~her friend, who shook her off rather,&#xD;
and bent her head-to Zambrano's whispers.. The people in the&#xD;
parquette were talking about them; one of the beauties of the&#xD;
season, a belle, engaged to that rich young Cuban." And though&#xD;
Miss Brandon knew perfectly well that many glasses were&#xD;
studying her, and many tongues were wagging about her, she&#xD;
looked simple and unconscious and beautiful.&#xD;
It was not long, however, before she recognized Bertha, who&#xD;
leaned forward to examine the dregs-circle, and with a half-&#xD;
startled face she tried to get 'a view of her companions ; and&#xD;
then dressed her lips and eyes in radiant gladness, and flut-&#xD;
tered her fan, and nodded rapturously. Dolores was delighted,&#xD;
and kissed her hand, and Zambrano bowed courteously.  Ber-&#xD;
tha bent her -head in return ; and seeing that Chris was. still&#xD;
ignorant of their neighborhood, drew back into her place and&#xD;
kept quiet, though she and Sabrina exchanged glances.&#xD;
The curtain rose upon the fourth act - the Gypsy scene.&#xD;

had been crying, began to feel fluttered and uneasy.  She&#xD;
could no longer -fix her attention' upon the' Gypsy tents, and&#xD;
she sighed, and threw a swift glance over the faces before her,&#xD;
which stopped upon the box opposite, empty till now, and she&#xD;
met the gaze of Otho Groenveldt, fastened upon her in sor-&#xD;
rowful, stern intentness. He was ghastly pale, and but a'&#xD;
shadow of himself; and Uncle Alec, who leaned his head&#xD;
upon his white hand, was watching his grave nephew, instead&#xD;
of the Gypsy child creeping forth to the call of the " Lord of&#xD;
high degree."'&#xD;
Chris's lids dropped over her pained eyes, and her forehead&#xD;
contracted into a troubled frown, and 'the whiteness of snow&#xD;
drifted into her cheek, blanching its scarlet glow.  John&#xD;
Peebles spoke to her, reaching down to whisper in her ear,&#xD;
and she forced herself to look up and reply. It was but an&#xD;
instant before a glad exclamation from Bertha, and a mur-&#xD;
mured communication to Sabrina, proved that she had recog-&#xD;
nized her brother, who bowed and smiled ; and then Uncle&#xD;
Alec jumped up briskly, and the two left their box, and came&#xD;
round to where Chris was sitting. She saw in the mirror at&#xD;
her side her floating curls, her breast-knot of fairy lilies, her&#xD;
spotless gloves, her soft, rosy-gray wrap, even the bouquet and'&#xD;
fan in her lap, and she studied also her face, and ruled it to&#xD;
her will. She remembered how he had left her, and why, and&#xD;
that they were thenceforth strangers. She knew the two gen-&#xD;
tlemen were in the box.. She heard Bertha's eager talk, and&#xD;
even the light kiss she dropped upon her brother's cheek, and&#xD;
knew intuitively the 'half displeasure such a caress would&#xD;
awaken in him in so public a place; but she did not turn her&#xD;
head till Uncle Alec touched Peebles' shoulder (who retreated&#xD;
instantly), and took the place beside her, and the look she&#xD;
gave him, with her two hands, was tremulous joy.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, I'm so glad you've come home, dear Uncle Alec; so&#xD;
glad ! " said she. She talked. on, feeling that she must pres-&#xD;
ently meet Otho's eyes, perhaps touch his hand. Pretty soon&#xD;
it came. Bertha whispered in her ear, " Chris, my brother is&#xD;
here," and then he came around in front of her and saluted&#xD;
her gravely, and sat down on the opposite chair, with his back&#xD;
to the stage. She saw his eyes inspect her dress, her hair, her&#xD;
face, and then she felt that his attention was fixed upon.4he&#xD;
jewels clasping her wrist. She -remembered who .owned the&#xD;
match gems, which were "for Otho's wife," and for one instant&#xD;
her eyelids fliddered, and her breath came with a sob; but she&#xD;
let her hands play quietly with her fan, and the sapphires and&#xD;
diamonds gleamed like-stars.&#xD;
"Where are you stopping, Otho ?" asked Bertha, who was&#xD;
still trembling with the excitement of the sudden' meeting.&#xD;
"At the St. James," he answered.&#xD;
Then Chris knew that it was indeed his voice, which had&#xD;
kept her dreaming through the long hours of the silent night.&#xD;
They were all seated again, Otho retaining his place, and con-&#xD;
tinuing his examination of Chris, speaking easily to her, from&#xD;
time to time, and looking in her face for her replies. Sabrina,&#xD;
who could not help watching them, was amazed by what she&#xD;
saw; the absolute power her friend showed over her emotions,&#xD;
or at least over their outward signs, sitting so still and so at-&#xD;
tentive, speaking in such a- smooth, sweet voice, scarcely a&#xD;
thrill beneath its purity. 'Presently Otho leaned forward.&#xD;
"You can give me news of my friend Max," said he.&#xD;
"You mistake, sir: I know nothing of his whereabouts," she&#xD;
replied, keeping her eyes upon the bracelet, though a burning&#xD;
blush suffused her face.&#xD;
"You have seen him since last Christmas," be insisted, put-&#xD;
ting his finger significantly upon the centre sapphire.&#xD;

THE EVENING OF -THE DA 1'.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I parted with him at twelve o'clock today, Mr. Groen.-&#xD;
veldt, in the parlor of the St. James," answered Chris, with.&#xD;
drawing her arm haughtily..&#xD;
"And you do not know whither he went ?"  His look was&#xD;
proud and incredulous.&#xD;
"Simply, no. I think I answered your question before. It&#xD;
is so many years since I said my catechism, that I. am afraid&#xD;
I-ave lost my fondness for answering questions, unless I feel&#xD;
sure the catechist has a right to propose them."&#xD;
Otho leaned back, and looked and felt offended, and spoke&#xD;
no.more to Chris, though he was chatty and kind to his sister.&#xD;
" How odd that we should all be in the same house, and not&#xD;
know it," said she. "Of course you are coming home to&#xD;
Rosenbloom with us?"&#xD;
"Oh, no, my-dear-; he is my boy now," replied Uncle Alec.&#xD;
"'Lochaber no more.'  From an M.D. he is transformed in-&#xD;
to a Mexican planter. Only for a little back-set he .got, and a&#xD;
slight illness,Yyou would not have had a look at your big&#xD;
brother for ever so many years. I'm going to keep him under&#xD;
my eye till he gets well."-&#xD;
"Gets well!f"  He had been ill, then. Chris glanced fur.&#xD;
tively at his pale face. He had suffered also.&#xD;
"Have you been very ill?" she asked, not knowing the lan-&#xD;
guage of her eyes.&#xD;
"I suppose yes, Miss Goldsmith, but it is humiliating to&#xD;
reflect upon my imperfect humanity; pray do not remind me&#xD;
of my weakness. I am quite well now, at all events, having&#xD;
fought it out with disease, and conquered."&#xD;
Uncle Alec felt uncomfortable. Otho finished his speech&#xD;
with a courteous bow, and Chris was inly amused with the&#xD;
Roland she had got for her Oliver, and fingered her bouquet&#xD;
in silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE EVENING OF THE DAZEo&#xD;

&#xD;
"Little Pet."  Uncle Alec"patted her hand.  "You are&#xD;
more like poor Fred than ever."&#xD;
" Do you think so? I am glad of that. There is nobody&#xD;
in the world who comes with my thoughts of papa so often as&#xD;
you, and those good times up at Craigenfels."&#xD;
"We'll try, little Pet, if we can't make the old"place gay&#xD;
again. I am going to have you all up there with me."&#xD;
"I cannot come, sir," answered Chris, sighing. "It will be&#xD;
a long time before I sit in the pleasant library, I believe. rm&#xD;
to be a teacher."&#xD;
" A teacher ! nonsense I Put that crotchet out of your&#xD;
pretty head; leave teaching to those whose vocation it is-to&#xD;
girls whom kind Providence has not blessed with wealth, and&#xD;
who feel the spur of necessity for the exertion of their best en-&#xD;
ergies. There is a richer life for .you; and now you are to&#xD;
come with me to Zoe's wedding. My guest, you know. Ah I&#xD;
Won't Deb go down on her knees and bless met"&#xD;
"But Uncle Alec, you don't understand; I assure you it is&#xD;
impossible."&#xD;
"That is right," whispered Sabrina, "you make her con-&#xD;
sent; she is deaf to the voice of my charming."&#xD;
" Make her ! Why, I hope little Pet will not be so unkind&#xD;
as to refuse her old uncle a pleasure he has set his heart&#xD;
upon," replied Mr. Craigenfels, in a hurt tone.&#xD;
"Please"-Chris laid her hand pleadingly on his-&#xD;
" please. don't speak of .it any more now, dearest uncle, and&#xD;
I'll tell you the whole why when we are alone."&#xD;
As soon as the play was over, Otho lifted courteously Chris's&#xD;
rosy-gray cloak.&#xD;
"Permit me, Miss Goldsmith," said he.&#xD;
" Thanks," she replied, taking it carelessly from his hands.&#xD;

TE EVENING OF 7E- DAY        .&#xD;
4" Uncle Alec is going to, be my knight. Now for courtly&#xD;
grace. Look, Mr. Peebles; study his style."&#xD;
She offered it and her shoulders to the old fellow, who&#xD;
wrapped her close in it, with a little hug.&#xD;
"Charming!" exclaimed Peebles; "I shall put that lesson&#xD;
in practice, the very first opportunity."&#xD;
Mr. Groenveldt examined the young scholar's face more&#xD;
-particularly than he had done, before he turned aside,' a trifle&#xD;
superciliously, and faced Belle. Brandon, who, with the Zam-&#xD;
branos, was waiting at the door of the box, all gushingness and&#xD;
dimples. Her .smiles were not for- him, however, and she ig-&#xD;
nored his presence entirely, and thrust up her little gloved.&#xD;
hands to Uncle Alec.&#xD;
"Oh, dear Mr. Craigenfels! I am so delighted to see you;&#xD;
how nice that you have not forgotten me! I was afraid I&#xD;
should have to say, "I'm little Belle ,Brandon. I've been 'con-&#xD;
stant in the practice of your lessons of piety. I'm very good&#xD;
now."&#xD;
" And very beautiful, too, my dear girl. 'Well, well! this is a&#xD;
pleasure'! So you are very good, are you ?  Yes; I can&#xD;
easily believe it; only a precious pure soul should dwell in&#xD;
such a lovely body. Here, Chris, Sabrina, Bertha! -Heaven&#xD;
bless 'Wallack for bringing together such a host of beauties!"&#xD;
Belle did not in the least mind the chilly greeting she got&#xD;
from the girls, but went on chatting musically. She did not&#xD;
mind Zambrano's black looks, either ; in fact, she was getting&#xD;
tired of his exactions and jealousies, and quite ready to throw&#xD;
him over for a more eligible fiarti; and the instant her eyes&#xD;
lighted upon Uncle Alec's genial face, the idea took possession&#xD;
of her to carry off this easy-going gentleman, appropriate this&#xD;
Mexiarrmine, and queen it at Craigenfels on her own account.&#xD;
She had already had .enough of society to understand that a&#xD;
&#xD;
THE EVENING OF THE .DAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
'297&#xD;
&#xD;
great deal of money is absolutely essential to happiness; and&#xD;
she was ready to give her .dream of a handsome youth. the&#xD;
go-by.&#xD;
"I'll see you to-morrow, -good people," said she, as Zam-&#xD;
brano put her into the carriage. "Meet me t.t PhilippL"&#xD;
"You take care of the ladies, Mr.:Peebles," said Uncle Alec&#xD;
to that youngster, who was wandering about vaguely. "I'l take&#xD;
Miss Goldsmith off your hands ; " and in another instant. she&#xD;
was seated by Otho Groenveldt's side ; but- if the kind old&#xD;
fellow' who sat opposite thought to get any pleasure.out2of his&#xD;
arrangement .beyond:a.fleeting glimpse of her. downcast face,&#xD;
as they whirled past the lamps, he was disappointed; for the&#xD;
two young people scarcely spoke all the way. Every thing&#xD;
seemed unreal to: the poor girl, and she. stepped out of the&#xD;
carriage, assisted by the man she had worshipped, as in a&#xD;
waking dream.&#xD;
Zoe and Peter were the first home, and pretty soon Jan and&#xD;
Sonsie had come in ; he with queer face, fun-lighted, and yet&#xD;
overclouded by vexation. The four were talking before the&#xD;
great window.of the tea-room; Zoe, who was, in the highest&#xD;
spirits, pouring out little snatches of the songs she had heard,&#xD;
and reciting the jokes, 'while they waited for their friends.&#xD;
"Well, Sonsie," said Peter, "how did you like your Irish&#xD;
play ?"&#xD;
"'Tis a very purty play, sir; and the pogue was a sweet&#xD;
thought, and. was well and bravely done of the little girl in the&#xD;
green spencer; nd very trim and nate she looked in it and&#xD;
her blue hosen and 'her short kirtl ; and she'd manage that&#xD;

down-trodden and made game of, and 'tis the fashion of the .&#xD;
Yankees to speer scoffs and, jeers at them; but no true lad&#xD;
would go up and down amongst ye, holding the ould country&#xD;
up to ridicule, - the dear land that'd be a paradise, only for&#xD;
the murderin' villians that's got the rule. of it, bad luck to 'em !"&#xD;
"You ought to have heard Sonsie rave at me," said Jan,&#xD;
laughing, "as if I had insulted her. I shook in my shoes. I&#xD;
was certain she was about to insist upon going behind the&#xD;
scenes, to upbraid Barney with his misbehavings."&#xD;
"Never fear me for that," Mr. Vedder. "I'd not give me&#xD;
lane tongue the job to -scold the silly fool, and he a Kildare&#xD;
boy 'hisself."&#xD;
They saw the carriage stop, and Chris descend, followed by&#xD;
the grave doctor and a stout gentleman, and Sonsie sprang to,&#xD;
meet her, saying, joyfully, " Ah ! my white angel ;" and she&#xD;
kissed her hand with the kind of adoration which her manner&#xD;
always had for Fred's daughter, and which, somehow, sat grace-&#xD;
fully upon her ; and Zoe and Peter and Jan exclaimed, "Uncle&#xD;
Alec! '" and all got hold of him at once.&#xD;
"I hope you have also a welcome for me," said Otho, offer-&#xD;
ing his hand to. Zoe, who glanced quickly at Chris, still and&#xD;
composed, before extending hers. If there was any want of&#xD;
cordiality, however, in her .reception, Peter and Jan, fully made&#xD;
up for it. Both were delighted to see him.&#xD;
4" And this is my dear friend Sonsie Eagan," said Chris, lead-&#xD;
ing, her up to Uncle Alec. "You must take:her into your fold,&#xD;
you kind shepherd.'&#xD;
Sonsie courtesied, in h r bold, modest way, and scanned the&#xD;
hearty, comfortable face before her with evident pleasure..&#xD;
"'Indeed, then, I think innocent lambs might be safe and&#xD;
happy under your guidance, sir," said she, fearlessly. "St.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
John hisself, in the picture of the holy apostles, hasn't a finer&#xD;
beard, nor a sweeter look of kindliness altogether entirely."&#xD;
Uncle Alec laughed, and put his mouth close to Sonsie's&#xD;
ear.&#xD;
"Did you ever hear of the blarney-stone, my dear?" asked&#xD;
he.&#xD;
" Oh, yes, indeed, sir, often ; but it's niver a kiss at all that&#xD;
I've given to it, for the reason that I'm keepin me kisses till I&#xD;
meet wid their lawful owner."&#xD;
"Mr. Groenveldt, allow me to present you to Miss Eagan,"&#xD;
said Zoe, seeing that Chris did not speak.&#xD;
"Sonsie Eagan, and Miss Walsingham's maid, at your ser-&#xD;
vice," replied the Irish girl, whose eyes turned from Uncle&#xD;
Alec, still lighted with the pride and merry mischief his ques-&#xD;
tion had called up. " Mr. Groegveldt is no stranger to me,&#xD;
Miss Zoe. Indeed, you. didn't row very handsome those&#xD;
times, did you, sir ?"&#xD;
Otho scanned Sonsie curiously, and returned her deep cour-&#xD;
tesy with a slight bow, and a little curl of his haughty rp, evi-&#xD;
dently wondering what manner of woman she might be, so&#xD;
downright in her comments, and so careless, of dignities ; and&#xD;
Jan was half amused at Sonsie's doings, and half vexed, but&#xD;
wholly filled with admiration for her lustrous beauty. Pretty&#xD;
soon the others arrived; Peebles still maundering a little&#xD;
vaguely, like a body cut loose- from its controlling attraction,&#xD;
and Sabrina walked up to Zoe in haste.&#xD;
"Who do you suppose we saw at Wallack's to-night ?" ex-&#xD;
claimed she.&#xD;
"Not Prince Arthur, nor Mrs. Stanton, nor tie king of the&#xD;
Cannibal Islands?"&#xD;
"Hush, Zoe ! DOe rarllor. She had the Z mbranos in&#xD;

convoy, and she was, as Chandy used to say, 'blue-eyed and&#xD;
beautiful.'"&#xD;
"Oh, ye tears! that evil spirit again ! What did she say?"&#xD;
"She was dressed like a duchess. Uncle Alec can tell you&#xD;
what she said, for she lavished all her smiles and sweetness on&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Yes ; Miss Brandon ! Oh, really a most bewitching,&#xD;
snperb girl, rarely lovely ! quite a contrast to that flashing&#xD;
Spanish beauty, and the black-browed fellow, -her brother, I&#xD;
suppose. He rather glared at me than otherwise, I thought.&#xD;
Those Spaniards make bad husbands for our free-spoken, inde-&#xD;
pendent girls ; and I hope that confiding, artless child, with.&#xD;
her swimming eyes, that entreat love with every simple glance,&#xD;
won'twhelp herself to sorrow. She reminded me very prettily of&#xD;
our meeting in the cars, and ,n admonition I gave her to prac-&#xD;
tice good works. I must f. ollect to prove to her that I also&#xD;
have a memory."&#xD;
The girls exchanged glances, and Zoe made a horrible face.&#xD;
"We'll all go down to that magazine of wonders, that Alad-&#xD;
din's cave of delights, where rubies and -pearls and diamonds&#xD;
are kept on purpose for good girls. Yes; we'll go to Ball &amp;amp;&#xD;
Black's, and we'll say to them, 'Gentlemren, show us sonle&#xD;
gems worthy of these young women you see before you;' and&#xD;
we'll buy. Do you like bracelets and brooches, brave lady ?"*&#xD;
asked Uncle Alec of Sonsie, who had been watching all his&#xD;
gestures, and listening to his talk in a sort of benevolent rap-&#xD;
ture. 'We came yery near being country-folk, I think, -&#xD;
you and I. I've seen some bonnie blue eyes, in my day,&#xD;
about county Kildare, -- as like to yours as two peas. Can&#xD;
you speak Irish ?"&#xD;
"No, sir; me father could, but; an.d me mother sings'some&#xD;
Irish songs that are sweeter than tlhe notes in the thrushes'&#xD;
&#xD;
throats. Me mother is a O'Rouke, sir." (Sonsie more Hiber-&#xD;
nicO. Uncle Alec straightened himself, and imitated her pose&#xD;
exactly.)&#xD;
"Ah ! county Ulster?" &#xD;
"The very same, sir. God love its braes and bonny&#xD;
fields !"&#xD;
"Well, Sonsie, we must shake hands on that ; .for n y, g t-&#xD;
grandmother was an O'Rouke of county Kildare; an    y&#xD;
grandmother had such a choice selection of tales, and legends,&#xD;
and fairy lore, as kept me pinned to her apron whenever she&#xD;
would open her budget, all about the Kilpies, and the 'has&#xD;
fial,' or crowning-stone, which used to sing when a good king&#xD;
was made upon it, and schreeled and howled if a wicked man&#xD;
but touched it with the tip of his finger. Did you ever hear&#xD;
that story, Sonsie?"&#xD;
"No, sir," she answered, coming a little closer to him, all&#xD;
ardor for the story ; " will ye plase tell it to me? Sure I&#xD;
know a beauty, that ud set it schreeling if. she but sot foot&#xD;
upon it."&#xD;
Uncle Alec laughed at her eager face.&#xD;
"Not to-night, my lass. 'Tis time to part., Thou hearest&#xD;
that hateful watchman's cry. Past twelve o'clock. Good-&#xD;
night."&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
LA HERIDA MAS GRAVE ; SE RECIBE DE QCULTA MANO."&#xD;
HE next morning, Mrs. Walsingham, Zoe, and Uncle&#xD;
Alec had a good long talk in the great parlor, looking&#xD;
down upon Wilson's sewing-machines; and they&#xD;
begged him to take Chris home with him.&#xD;
"I wish her to be my bridesmaid, and I will have her. You&#xD;
must carry her off by force, if necessary."'&#xD;
Yes, indeed," said Sabrina who had come in while Zoe was,&#xD;
speaking. "Yes; and we must see to her dresses. We know&#xD;
quite well how her mother treats her as to money. She was so&#xD;
sour, when we went to Brookside, on the subject of the&#xD;
wedding."&#xD;
'.Dresses ! Of course; get her every thing, any thing you&#xD;
can think of. What-! Fred's child ill-provided! Why he was&#xD;
the daintiest fellow; and he loved to see his darling arrayed&#xD;
like the lilies. I remember quite -well how she used to go in,&#xD;
white, and her Paris slippers and the like ! She was his idol."&#xD;
Zoe enlightened the old fellow somewhat upon Chris's status,&#xD;
and caused him to open his eyes, and the mammals enlarged a&#xD;
good deal, and spoke their minds quite freely tipon the mother-&#xD;
hood of the widow.&#xD;
"How lucky that I came home as I did," exclaimed Uncle&#xD;
Alec, with joyous mien, and jingling the loose cash in his pock-&#xD;
ets,; " the-mines and the indigo, and the coffee, and the rest,-&#xD;
have piled in the money this year.; what a perfect god-send, to&#xD;
find some good young people who can put it into use for me."&#xD;
Belle Brandon entered the parlor just in time to hear these&#xD;
words, and her gushingness and absolute innocence were won-&#xD;
&#xD;
derful. She threw a comprehensive glance around her, and&#xD;
was full of affection. After an ernpressse greeting- to them all,&#xD;
she sank down upon the sofa, close to Uncle Alec, who re-&#xD;
turned her bewitching little smile with one' of expansive benev-&#xD;
olence, including admiration for her loveliness and perfect dress,&#xD;
-perfect, from the costly black velvet cloak down:tox-the tiny&#xD;
buttoned boot, of which, she displayed the tip from under her&#xD;
satin petticoat.&#xD;
"I am very glad to see you, my dear," said he, "because&#xD;
we shall impress your taste into our service, we have arduous&#xD;
labors before us."  Then whispering behind his hand, and close&#xD;
to Belle's peachy cheek, he added, "There's the cadeau to buy&#xD;
for the betrothed."&#xD;
Zoe ran to fetch her mother's shawl, and met. Chris just out-&#xD;
side the door.&#xD;
" Marplot has arrived," said she, concisely. She also ran&#xD;
over Otho and Bertha, who were coming down the hall in close&#xD;
conversation. "That odious girl I she's in there. I wish you&#xD;
had all been in bed and asleep that night; instead of poking off&#xD;
to the old theatre. You can't shake her off any more than&#xD;
you could the old man of the sea."&#xD;
" Oh, a morning call or so won't hurt us," - said Bertha, simil&#xD;
ing, " and, of course, we are not obliged to return them if we&#xD;
don't -choose. I wouldn't be so disturbed, Zoe."&#xD;
"I'll tell you, Miss Bertha, I should not be in the least sur-&#xD;
prised if she wheedled an invitation to Craigenfels. I believe&#xD;
she is fishing for it."&#xD;
"Nonsense, Zoel! I've heard her declare often and often&#xD;
that she'd never set foot in Roaring River again."&#xD;
"Oh, grant that she may stick to her resolve, and keep us&#xD;
safe from her," said Zoe, speeding on her errand.&#xD;
"Yes, Chris and Bertha," said Uncle Alec, continuing his&#xD;
Chrs ad Brth,"                           ;:ii&#xD;

&#xD;
plans for the day. "We'llgo to Ball &amp;amp; Black's, and this young&#xD;
lady will accompany us. I always enjoy taking a lot of beau-&#xD;
tiful girls into a jeweller's shop."&#xD;
"Miss Goldsmith has developed a taste for trinkets since we&#xD;
parted, I think," said - Belle, floating up, and lifting the arm,&#xD;
from which-Max's sapphires had not been removed: "this is a&#xD;
rare gem, indeed.'&#xD;
Chris snatched away her wrist, and could not help glancing&#xD;
at Otho, who was quietly studying her; and Belle Brandon&#xD;
knew instantly that there was some story connected with that&#xD;
bracelet, and was curious to find it out, and eager to ascertain&#xD;
the status of all parties; and readily accepted Uncle Alec's in-&#xD;
vitation, calculating her chances of wheedling something out of&#xD;
somebody for her own adornment. As the girls withdrew, she&#xD;
fastened upon Bertha-&#xD;
"Do you like being in society as much as you expected,&#xD;
Belle?"&#xD;
Bertha did her best to be civil, while she fully endorsed Zoe's&#xD;
opinion of the " marplot."&#xD;
"Oh, yes,. I like it rather ; I have attention enough, and no&#xD;
end of offers, and I enjoy my squabbles with Aunt Isadore.. I&#xD;
have a scene over every article I wear ; and I look passably&#xD;
well dressed, I think."&#xD;
"You see a great deal of the Zambranos, I supposes? "&#xD;
"Toutes lesfoisgquife eux," replied Belle, carelessly. "Do-&#xD;
lores is always hanging about one9'&#xD;
"She's a dear affectionate girl. I became truly attached to&#xD;
her. She was lovely last 'evetiing in her black and gold robe,&#xD;
--as bright as a star."&#xD;
"She is passable, certainly if one likes the deep, intense&#xD;
style ; so manyfeelings get fatiguing, and such constant car-&#xD;
resses; I dontt fancy it myself. She is apt to look rather sal&#xD;
&#xD;
low of a morning after dancing. Brunettes always do. By the&#xD;
way, it seems to me you haven't quite your old bloom, Bertha.;&#xD;
are you not well ?"&#xD;
Bertha drew the long black tresses' she was brushing, down&#xD;
over her face, and felt uncomfortable, and made no reply.&#xD;
" Your brother is changed also : he gangs like a ghost. What&#xD;
ails you all ?"&#xD;
As Bertha had no idea of talking except the baldest general-&#xD;
ities, she replied that Otho was just recovering from a fever;&#xD;
and changed the subject.&#xD;
" Have the Zambranos decided to remain in New York ? "&#xD;
"Oh,-no, indeed ! they return to their plantation this spring,&#xD;
and beg and implore me to accompany them; but' I have no&#xD;
idea of going into a shell at present.- Plantation-life with Hen-&#xD;
riques Zambrano would be just a dose of that person morning,&#xD;
noon, and night, and he rages at anybody who as much as looks&#xD;
at me. I rather liked it at first,-so'romantic,- but he gets&#xD;
monotonous. However, his idea of presents -are magnificent,&#xD;
- I must accord him that praise."&#xD;
Belle arranged her bracelets, and admired her brooch and&#xD;
earrings in the mirror over Bertha's shoulder.&#xD;
"By the way, cherie, do you ever hear, from our old friend&#xD;
Chandos, the spouter of Shakespere?"&#xD;
Bertha blushed painfully, and could hardly reply.&#xD;
"Sometimes,"-she stammered;. " that is," feeling it necessary&#xD;
to be truthful, "I read his letters to Chris once in a while."&#xD;
" Dolores is his most constant correspondent, I fancy.- Not&#xD;
a week goes by that the little simpleton doesn't get a letter ; and&#xD;
such letters ! six, twelve, twenty pages; and I must do Mr.&#xD;
Goldsmith the justice to say, that his epistles are both brilliant&#xD;
and amusing, though the goose of a Dolores hides postscripts&#xD;

and particular-bits from me,- too tender for my melting mood,&#xD;
I suppose."-&#xD;
Bertha got as pale as a ghost, and Miss Brandon's eyes glit.&#xD;
tered as she floated off with Sabrina, who looked in to - see if&#xD;
her friend was ready. Peter and Jan were gone to the cattle.&#xD;
market in search of Kerrys and Guernseys. Zoe and the two&#xD;
mammas went to Lord &amp;amp; Taylor's, and Peebles down to Nas-&#xD;
sau Street, where he wished to work the book-mine he and&#xD;
Chris had struck, and the others were waiting for Bertha.&#xD;
Pretty soon she came, looking so weary and white, that Otho&#xD;
immediately ordered her to stay at home.&#xD;
"Ill ! Bertha, ill! Why she was as hearty as a duck half an&#xD;
hour ago," said Uncle Alec, taking her chin,-in his hand. " You&#xD;
are tired, my pretty! up too late last night, missed your beauty&#xD;
sleep. Ah, well ! we will put off our business another day.&#xD;
Jewels will keep."&#xD;
"Am I the sinner, mea cuffa ?" said Belle, floating up, in&#xD;
virgin innocence, and brushing Uncle Alec's vest with her&#xD;
curls, in her loving anxiety to get a glimpse of Bertha's face.&#xD;
"I made an indiscreet, statement.  I do remember now, she&#xD;
got white directly. Can you forgive me? unfortunate little&#xD;
wretch that I am ! always stepping on somebody's toes. Now&#xD;
I assure you, Mr. Craigenfels, I hadn't the remotest idea when&#xD;
I told Bertha that ---"&#xD;
" I am quite well indeed,!" said the poor girl, hastily pushing&#xD;
off the blonde, who had kissed her cheek in the most childish,&#xD;
cunning penitence. "Nothing ails me,- do let us go at once."&#xD;
Belle was satisfied : she had no idea of losing her pleasure,&#xD;
and her prospective gain, for any of Miss Bertha's sick fancies.&#xD;
But T.ncle Alec still missed some one.&#xD;
"Ah i where is our bonny O'Rouke?" asked he.&#xD;
Belle was all attention at once. Uncle Alec had got Jan's&#xD;
&#xD;
position in a long confidential.talk, before they slept, the night&#xD;
before ; and he heartily approved of his course, and filled the&#xD;
young fellow's soul full of delight by his praises of Sonsie.&#xD;
Chris went quietly and fetched the lassie, who came, briskly&#xD;
stepping and stood before him..&#xD;
An' is it me, sir, that ye'd be after wanting, sir? .Sure I&#xD;
hope there's something I can do for you."&#xD;
"Yes, my pretty O'Rouke, there is. You are to fetch your&#xD;
hat till we have a little step together," replied Uncle Alec, in&#xD;
as rich a brogue as her own.&#xD;
"Who'is this girl ?" asked Belle of Chris,&#xD;
" Her name is Sonsie ; she is a friend of ours, and shortly ; to&#xD;
become a pupil at Rosenbloom," replied Chris, in absolute&#xD;
ease. "Come hasten, dear!" she added, caressingly ; going&#xD;
up to Sonsie, who had heard the question and the reply.&#xD;
"I thought I was not mistaken,' exclaimed Belle; "this is&#xD;
Mrs. Deacon Williams's housemaid ! What wave of fortune&#xD;
brings her here among gentlefolks."&#xD;
Uncle Alec and Otho looked curiously at the erect Milesian,&#xD;
whose eyes were fixed upon the blonde, and who stood erect&#xD;
and fearless.&#xD;
"I can aisy answer that for, ye, Miss Belle ; sure 'twas nary&#xD;
wave at all, but the cars just; and Miss Walsingharp, whose&#xD;
maid I am, can tell ye why I came, not that I had any expecta-&#xD;
tion of seeing you either, though I have no objection in course.&#xD;
Miss Mary Ann has been very ill, and she used often to be&#xD;
talking of you; the picture you made, and the dresses you&#xD;
wore, and all that happened last year,- Faith! ye made a busy&#xD;
year of it,-.nd as ye were sayin', these be real gentlefolks.. I.&#xD;
know now better than I used the makins. of a lady,-- there's&#xD;
truth, purity, culture, delicacy, and purple blood. D'ye mind&#xD;

&#xD;
that now, Miss -Belle ? Oh, yes, Mr. Craigenfels, I'll step out&#xD;
wid ye, and pleased, since ye 'are so kind as ask me."&#xD;
Otho studied Sonsie Eagan's face-in some astonishment, and,&#xD;
Uncle Alec was amazingly tickled with her reply, and 'her up.&#xD;
right, free, graceful demeanor; but at the same time, knowing&#xD;
the world, and its prejudices and customs, he was amused&#xD;
with the artless betrayal of surprise on the part of the "child of&#xD;
society," and was not by any means hard upon her, though he&#xD;
took occasion to change the subject."&#xD;
Otho, my boy, what a lovely show we have got with these&#xD;
four styles of beauty, for wax figures. We'll arrange somlas&#xD;
soon as we get home to Craigenfels.".'&#xD;
"I think I shall not leave New York at present. I intend&#xD;
to get about my engines and presses directly," looking at Chris,&#xD;
who flushed and fluttered."&#xD;
"We won't start an argument on that subject now," replied&#xD;
Uncle Alec, impatiently. "'Sufficient unto the day;' and I've&#xD;
my hands full with these girls."&#xD;
Belle unwittingly did Sonsie Eagan an especial service. Sa.&#xD;
brina had rather stood aloof; now she thought deeply upon the&#xD;
requisites for a lady, and she mentally contrasted the true&#xD;
womanly nature she knew Sonsie owned, with the beauty, and&#xD;
she came out decidedly: It seemed 'that some 'one else had&#xD;
been thinking also ; for when the  rish lassie presently re&#xD;
turned, looking fresh as a rose, clear-eyedand niodest, Otho&#xD;
bowed gravely to her, as they all started out together, and he&#xD;
took his place beside Chris as easily and naturally-as if it still&#xD;
belonged to him; and her eyes, seeking the ground, rested upon&#xD;
his boot,well shaped and perfect, and thence at his gloves, and&#xD;
then mounted to his face,'grave -and pale, and she felt a little&#xD;
kindly sympathy. He had been ill, poor fellow, though he did&#xD;
not like. being reminded of it. Did he have tender nursing?&#xD;
&#xD;
She was very near asking some such question, when he&#xD;
spoke.,&#xD;
"So our sprightly friend, Miss Zoe, is about to marry!"&#xD;
Something in his tone was extremely-unpleasant, and sent&#xD;
the crimson into her cheek, and he quietly studied her counte-&#xD;
nance, her chestnut curls, her dress, and watched the play of&#xD;
her lips while she answered. He was cool, masterful, and&#xD;
courteous through all; but his demeanor irritated her ; his posi-&#xD;
tion by her side, so easily taken, without her consent, was a&#xD;
trial of her nerve-power. If the Doctor knew it, if he saw her&#xD;
flickering color, and the old wistfulness he used to love, steal-&#xD;
ing into her brown .eyes, he made no sign; he was attending to&#xD;
her reply, which she :framed at her best.&#xD;
"It is true, sir, what you have heard. 'Honor, riches, mar-&#xD;
riage-blessing' are ready for Zoe, who. hurries her preparations&#xD;
for the approaching day; all of which she thoroughly enjoys, as&#xD;
she does every occupation she picks up. Zoe is ;a refreshing&#xD;
girl, so positive, so full of merry conceits and pretty whims, one&#xD;
never tires of her."&#xD;
"You praise your friends roundly, Miss Goldsmith (with a&#xD;
provoking smile). The. little gypsy is very charming and&#xD;
piquant certainly ; and the traits you mention are extremely&#xD;
agreeable. 7 In a wife, however something more might be de-&#xD;
sired to insure happiness.' I remember quite well, for in-&#xD;
stance, a summary of matrimonial needs, which I heard' once,&#xD;
which seemed to me quite complete : 'love, respect, repose,&#xD;
satisfaction, iconcord, mutual giving and receiving.',"&#xD;
Chris was startled; frightened. This fearless touching of&#xD;
old days, and that day among the provence buds above al&#xD;
penetrated her very soul. She looked at him grave, upright,&#xD;
"dominant," and she half thought, hard and cruel also, and felt&#xD;
that she would need all, her strength, all her self-poise to carry&#xD;

&#xD;
herself discreetly in his presence, and she would not falter or&#xD;
show any weakness; but she smiled a little bitterly.&#xD;
"I suppose, when I made up that remarkable estimate,&#xD;
whose carefulFrepetition does credit to your memory, that I&#xD;
was interested in the subject. Did/-ever you hear an old say.&#xD;
ing, La Aerida mas grave; se recipe de oculta mano 9"&#xD;
If Chris thought to shelter herself behind her proverb, she&#xD;
was mistaken ; for Otho answered,~-&#xD;
"That reminds me of my good Max. The saying was often&#xD;
in his mouth. He should be of our party, being learned in&#xD;
choice gems."&#xD;
Chris involuntarily dropped her eyes upon her sapphires.&#xD;
"Did the dear boy tell you a story of a brooch he -knows&#xD;
about?  I was promised the tale by his mother; but the time&#xD;
never came for me to hear it. I believe it was wrought&#xD;
among her bridal days. Shall I tell you who.is to have a set&#xD;
of sapphires, if she can be found, Miss Goldsmith ? "&#xD;
Chris was deeply embarrassedand would have plucked off&#xD;
the bracelet and hidden it out of sight, if she had dared, and&#xD;
fully resolved to do so the first opportunity. Meanwhile,&#xD;
Uncle Alec had paused before a window, within which stood a&#xD;
case of gorgeous butterflies, azure, sea-green,.violet, vivid scar-&#xD;
let and cobalt, such as flit about the Brazilian passion-flowers;&#xD;
and he waited till Sonsie. and Sabrina came up.&#xD;
"Roukie, did. ever you. see a collection of moths?" asked&#xD;
he,&#xD;
".Niver, sir, barrin' the cunnin' villians that's sure to be getting'&#xD;
round on old muffs, sir."&#xD;
She was gazing straight at Belle Brandon. A sudden thought&#xD;
possessed her that that blonde beauty w9uld like to-be lady of,&#xD;
Csaigenfels. She couldn't have told why she thought it; but&#xD;
she seemed .to know that she had such a plan, and her blue&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes looked rather threatening, so much so, in fact, that Belle&#xD;
wished her disposed of, even as the good old deacon prayed to&#xD;
be delivered from his scolding wife, -" 0 Lord, let her be&#xD;
gently removed."&#xD;
Uncle Alec took off his hat, and hid his face behind it.&#xD;
"Let us walk on, my dear," said he to Belle.&#xD;
"Why, Sonsie, what induced you to make such a rude&#xD;
speech to Uncle Alec ?"&#xD;
"'Tis Bible truth, Miss Sabrina, and no lie at all. What was&#xD;
wrong with me.saying ?  Sure, I'd niver drame of being rude&#xD;
to such a kind gentleman as Mr. Craigenfels."&#xD;
When Sabrina explained the force and bearing of the re-&#xD;
mark, Sonsie's eyes lighted with fun.&#xD;
" The gentleman 'll kindly forgive me ignorance. And&#xD;
wasn't it the sharp cut that I give yon blue-eyed lass that was&#xD;
niver any good, 'tis me sworn belief, egg nor burd! Look at&#xD;
her ! dear young lady! a leaning on his arm, and peeping into his&#xD;
handsome old face. Ah! wisha ! Craigenfels'11 have a mistress,&#xD;
I'm thinking, .that'll make things spin, if she gets her will. I've&#xD;
watched her tricks and her manners down at the Deacon's,&#xD;
when she usen't to think I was minding; and if it comes, she'll&#xD;
be worse nor the old song, 'she'll cross him and rack him till&#xD;
she'll heart-br'ak him,' and a sore pity for all is- brewing the&#xD;
day he tales her home."&#xD;
Sabrina had good opportunity to test her new conclusions,&#xD;
as. she walked with Sonsie in her black dress, trim gloves and&#xD;
shoes. She found her bright, fresh face and deep violet eyes&#xD;
enjoyable, and owned that she looked like a lady, and eve&#xD;
word she uttered, though richly twirled and twisted on he&#xD;
Irish tongue,'proved that she had the elements of"'gentleness '&#xD;
in her soul; and Sabrina, the lady, pointed out the objects of&#xD;
interest to the companion she had chosen, and chatted: pleas.&#xD;

antly ; and quick-witted Sonsie read her through and through,&#xD;
She had made her point upon Belle, and she felt merry and&#xD;
lively, and she poured forth her witty trifles so mirth-provoking,&#xD;
and took what Sabrina offered "across her gulf." '.&#xD;
Uncle Alec consulted Miss Brandon upon the cadeau, and&#xD;
after remembering that Zoe loved brilliant stones, -rubies, dia.&#xD;
monds, and the like, which suited her gypsy- style, she sug.&#xD;
gested pearls ; and the first thing Uncle Alec asked for was a&#xD;
choice of the treasures of the deep, and he laid aside a magnifi.&#xD;
cent set, and really it was an admirable . selection, because&#xD;
Peter and Jan had been in on their way down, and there were&#xD;
some dazzling things getting engraved 'with a Zoe, in some&#xD;
back apartment, at that very moment.&#xD;
Now Miss Brandon made a discovery: gazing down among&#xD;
the gems, she found a green brooch ; a cluster of pansies, the&#xD;
two lower petals of each a precious opal, like those which are&#xD;
compared, in the Orphic poem, to the delicate complexion of a&#xD;
lovely youth; and the upper ones formed of such amethysts as&#xD;
Heliodorus describes in the king of Ethiopia's ring: "and so&#xD;
saying, he put into his hands a ring, one of the royal jewels, an&#xD;
extraordinary and astonishing thing, the shank being formed of&#xD;
electrum, and,. the beasil flaming with an Ethiopian amethyst,&#xD;
in size, abput the form of a maiden's eye, but in beauty far sur-&#xD;
passing  the  Iberian sort, which  blushes "with a feeble&#xD;
hue like a rose. just unfolding its leaves from  the bud,&#xD;
and beginning to be tinged by the red of the sunbeams;&#xD;
but the Ethiopian amethyst, out of its depth, flames&#xD;
rth like a torch ; a pure, and, as - it were, spring-like&#xD;
auty."  Belle ordered the clerk to. produce the brooch, and&#xD;
she took it in her hand to a window and studied it, keeping&#xD;
her back to the party the while. The four pansies had eyes of&#xD;
Spanish topaz, and were hung upon golden; stems, and reposed&#xD;
&#xD;
" LA HERIDA MAS GRAVE."&#xD;
&#xD;
313&#xD;
&#xD;
among emerald leaves of studded work, exceeding rare. She&#xD;
considered with care. They might not see the brooch.   She&#xD;
hated to put Chris in possession of such a choice beauty, which,&#xD;
she spitefully reflected, was just quaint enough forther; but she&#xD;
turned at length, her mind made up. The delight of stabbing&#xD;
a girl she hated in the presence of all who knew her stoty, face&#xD;
to face with the proud man who had made her suffer, and also&#xD;
inflicting the wound so delicately that Uncle Alec (who, she&#xD;
had assured herself sby adroit strategy, knew nothing of .Otho's&#xD;
affairs) should admire her kind impulses, her pretty eagerness&#xD;
to serve a friend. She floated down to the group, who had&#xD;
their heads together over a "regard ring" Uncle Alec was&#xD;
about to buy; a secret gift to a lady he loved, and never;forgot&#xD;
to please, and exclaimed, throwing her . blue eyes upon the&#xD;
genial gentleman's face, swimming in childish eagerness, her&#xD;
dimples all displayed, and her pearls of teeth, --&#xD;
" Look, Mr. Craigenfels ! look all of you 1 this lovely thing&#xD;
for Chris; her favorite and most cherished flower. She wears&#xD;
them on her bosom ; she weaves them among her curls. She&#xD;
crowned with them the Sapho knot, that day of days when she&#xD;
rode like fair Rosamond her coal-black steed. You remember&#xD;
that day, Mr. Groenveldt, and our dinner up at Craigefels ;&#xD;
she kissed them as they had been lovers. Come, buy it, kind&#xD;
sir; and let me place it, with a wish for her future and a thought&#xD;
for her past."&#xD;
Chris's-dilating eyes were fastened upon the blonde, but she&#xD;
saw not the peachy bloom in her creamy face, nor the scarlet&#xD;
of her lips, nor her soft, floating curls; the melodious tone of her&#xD;
voice jarred on her sense.&#xD;
"A snake's small eye blinks dull and sly.&#xD;
And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head;&#xD;
Each shrunk up to a serpent's, eye,&#xD;
With something of malice, and more of dread."&#xD;

&#xD;
The words so possessed her that she could hardly refrain&#xD;
from speaking them ; and yet Belle had, never looked more&#xD;
radiantly beautiful, and, in the -next passing moment, Chris&#xD;
lived through the wretchedness in the library, when she had&#xD;
stood apart, despised shunned, and Belle Brandon's Geraldine&#xD;
glance," a tongue of, light -ad a flit of flamee" had triumphed&#xD;
in her agony. Uncle {Alec took the eager speaker's hands, box&#xD;
and all, and patted them kindly.&#xD;
"Good little girl!" said he. "You love to give pretty&#xD;
Pet pleasure, don't you? Yes, yes ; she' shall .have the&#xD;
brooch, if it suits her. That's precisely the use and value of&#xD;
such gauds, to gratify nice children. I've a small affair to&#xD;
settle with your bright eyes presently. Come, Chris, darling ;&#xD;
do you like the thing of aiethysts and opals ? An-oddity, is&#xD;
it not?"&#xD;
"That is one reason it suits Cherie. She's an oddity, too.&#xD;
Of course she likes it, only she's modest," put in B3elle, gayly.&#xD;
Before Chris had time to gather up her thoughts, so' that the&#xD;
"sight to dream of, riot to tell," had faded, and left- only the&#xD;
faces of her friends, Sabrina touched her, as'if she would have&#xD;
said, Do not permit her to trouble you," and then Chris drew&#xD;
her hand within Uncle Alec's arm.&#xD;
"Come here, my dearkind uncle," said she; "I will show&#xD;
you what I want. These ornaments are all pretty, but I was&#xD;
early taught to despise them. Here are the gems I delight&#xD;
She led him to a case, of bronzes, an'd poited out an "An-&#xD;
adne," and when they returned the pansy brooch was gone.&#xD;
"Now, Miss Brandon, for the reward of goodworks. Since&#xD;
you flatter an old fellow by remembering what he says, you&#xD;
must let him show his gratitude. Come, pretty one, what&#xD;
shall it be?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Could you match me that bracelet on Chris's arm?"&#xD;
asked she.&#xD;
" Chrs I little pet. I do recollect. I was going to look at&#xD;
it when you mentioned it before. What I sapphires ::ad dia-&#xD;
nonds! Why, this is a. wonderful beauty ! I ,amn afraid our&#xD;
friends Ball &amp;amp; Black cannot show its fellow. Is ita famly&#xD;
jewel, Chris?"&#xD;
" I believe. so, sir, but not of the Goldsmith family."&#xD;
Chris looked deeply pained and unhappy.&#xD;
" Look here, Otho, my boy. Did youever see such an odd&#xD;
setting?"&#xD;
"Very odd, indeed. I have seen itoften.&#xD;
Uncle Alec glanced from Chris's face to. his nephew's, and&#xD;
privately concluded that she was wearmg his g ft, and =he was&#xD;
more mystified than ever." The clerk behind the counter liap..&#xD;
pened to be the same who had attended Max, ande he looked&#xD;
pointedly at Chris's wnst, sayng,-&#xD;
"I hope the engraving. please you, Miss I-Your gentlem an&#xD;
found a good deal of fault ; but it was just as he ordered,.for&#xD;
all that.'&#xD;
Poor Chris was ready todrop, aid Belle went on smoothly,&#xD;
"I could fancy something blue, Mr. Craiggnfels. Pease&#xD;

"pure womanly" to require any charm against the wine-cup,&#xD;
we needn't mind. Show us something blue."&#xD;
"How could you fancy turquoise, sir ?" displaying a mag.&#xD;
nificent set in Etruscan gold.&#xD;
Belle quickly observed that there was a coronet of showy&#xD;
workmanship, and said, modestly,-&#xD;
"Those are as blue as truth, sir. I like them. But if they&#xD;
should be too costly?"&#xD;
"Nothing can be tdo costly to reward good works."&#xD;
Belle began, to regret that she had not selected diamonds ;&#xD;
but, with her possibilities, she saw them hers in the resplendent&#xD;
future. Sonsie and Sabrina were studying the bronzes, which&#xD;
Chris was explaining, and Uncle Alec came up, and said, -&#xD;
"Roukie, my dear, I want to give you a brooch for the sake&#xD;
of the kin blood. Come and chose it."&#xD;
Sonsie's face lighted.&#xD;
"An' is it a brooch, sir, for me breast? Indeed, then,&#xD;
there's the beautiful green glass one over there would plase me&#xD;
rarely. That one,-sir.&#xD;
Uncle Alec laughed heartily, and the clerk could not help&#xD;
joining, as he produced a fine emerald, set around with grad-&#xD;
uated beryls, three deep, and laid it down for inspection.&#xD;
"Excuse the fang," said Belle to Otho;."but that girl is&#xD;
any thing but green."&#xD;
"Roukie, I'll get that trifling esmeralda on these conditions:&#xD;
You shall never offer to return it to me ; you shall never give&#xD;
it away, and you shall let me put on the match jewels when&#xD;
you're married."&#xD;
"I'll promise all that aisy enough sir. I'm not the girl to&#xD;
gve away my fairings; and when married ! Ye're safe enough&#xD;
there. The trim young bachelo that's to say ' Sonsie, will' ye&#xD;
&#xD;
marry me, for bether or for worse,' hasn't come over from&#xD;
Limerick yet - and small loss."&#xD;
Nobody but Uncle Alec and his "fust cousin " knew what&#xD;
Chris's prettiest fairing was, because he tucked her under his&#xD;
arm, and walked off and bought it in secrecy, and chuckled-&#xD;
and he and she had the pleasure of putting it on, with a couple&#xD;
of kisses apiece, -f a delicate frost-work chain, and a little&#xD;
watch.&#xD;
M rs. Vedder came home from her shopping in high feather,&#xD;
she having made a raid on Sonsie's apartment, and carried off&#xD;
the exact measurement of her black bombazine, and purchased&#xD;
a complete school-girl outfit, which she exhibited to Jan, with&#xD;
vast exultation. He admired the purchase, and hugged the&#xD;
purchaser.&#xD;
"Now, mother," said he, " the next thing is to, coax her to&#xD;
wear them."&#xD;
" Coax her 1" replied .Mrs. Vedder.&#xD;
She folded the garments out of sight directly. To tell the&#xD;
truth, she had been visited by sundry misgivings;of the same&#xD;
pattern, though she so indignantly repudiated her son's sug-&#xD;
gestion.&#xD;
Uncle Alec knocked at. Chris's door that evening, and found&#xD;
Sonsie holding her "white angel" in her strong, loving arms.&#xD;
Ie insisted,in a grandfatherly way, that Chris should acconipany&#xD;
him to Craigenfels for her vacation, and Sonsie entreated her&#xD;
to consent. The poor girl desired so much to-see home sights&#xD;
again, and get a breath of native air, to hug Rainbow, and be&#xD;
cuddled by Del, and renew her Horseshoe pleasures, that she&#xD;
was sorely tempted to brave her mother's displeasure, which&#xD;
she felt sure would visit her: heavily, pelt, her with hard words,&#xD;
at any rate, "nail her wi' a scriptur' ;" and a rernark of Uncle&#xD;

eyes fixed upon Belle Brandon's graceful figure, which she saw&#xD;
through the half-open door, awaiting admission to Sabrina's&#xD;
room, opposite.&#xD;
" Ahi!" said he, "is it because you fear to intrude upon"--&#xD;
"Upon yon young lady, sir?  No, indeed; 'tis little regard&#xD;

decided emphasis.&#xD;
Yes, little pet ; she promised me last evening to be of our&#xD;
party," replied Uncle Alec, much disturbed by the expression.&#xD;
of the two honest faces he liked so well.&#xD;
Bertha had turned the cold shoulder to the blonde that very&#xD;
morning in the-most pointed manner, and -Sabrina was loftily&#xD;
polite; and, as for Zoe, she snubbed her so viciously,. that the&#xD;
innocent beauty's appealing blue eyes had haunted him for an&#xD;
hour afterwards. None of them manifested the rapture he&#xD;
expected, when he announced his victory over the reluctant&#xD;
darling, who feared to trespass 'upon his hospitality; was too&#xD;
poor to afford, the journey ; hesitated to leave her mission-&#xD;
people, &amp;amp;c. He could not understand why this lovely, -inno-&#xD;

young folks. It;troubled him.:&#xD;

WHAT BECAME OF ZITELLA.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
WHAT BECAME OF ZITELLA.&#xD;
HE golden moonlight streamed over the Bayo Her.&#xD;
moso, and powdered its ripples with diamonds, which&#xD;
sparkled in the eyes of a young man, who sat in the&#xD;
shadow of an arbor of passion-vines, and struck the strings of a&#xD;
zittern, to which he sang, in a rich, mellow voice, -&#xD;
"Gentle Zitella, why shouldst thou fear ?&#xD;
Love's ritornello tarry and hear."&#xD;
"Hilario waits for me," said the Indian maid, hastening on&#xD;
with springing step. Her rebozza half hid her face, and her&#xD;
little hands fingered her rosary, of which she told the shining&#xD;
beads, as she trod the winding path among the flower-laden,&#xD;
odorous trees. She prayed for Senor Aleka, and for her lover,&#xD;
Hilario,' witl whom she was about to spend an hour by the&#xD;
sounding se. Prayers, mounting from pure souls, have wings&#xD;
to cleave the skies. Ah, pretty Zitella, be fervent ; you have&#xD;
need of heavenly help. There was tumult in the Hacienda.&#xD;
The dogs were out, and the Dohle was running hither and&#xD;
thither, giving tongue to his deep-mouthed bay.  The Indian&#xD;
maid had been singing among her roses at eventide, and Uncle&#xD;
Alec was sure he had seen her shadow on the white curtain&#xD;
which hid her maiden's bower before he went to sleep, but now&#xD;
she was gone -breakfast hour, and no Zitella.&#xD;
George Blair, returning from the Romanza, had come upon&#xD;
old yellow-skinned.Chapeta, counting gold pieces, beneath an&#xD;
acacia, which she hastily covered with her petticoat, as she saw&#xD;
his lengthening shadow in the moonlight, gliding toward her on&#xD;
&#xD;
WH4AT BECAME OF ZITELLA.&#xD;
&#xD;
321&#xD;
&#xD;
the ground. The Spanish ship, so long moored.in Bayo Her..&#xD;
moso, had disappeared. George took old Chapeta by her&#xD;
skinny shoulders.&#xD;
" Where's Zitella ?" demanded he.&#xD;
"Gone to the devil, I hope," she answered, yelping with&#xD;
laughter.&#xD;
"Any news of the poor child ? " asked Uncle Alec, throwing&#xD;
himself off his steaming bracador, and wiping his heated,&#xD;
anxious face.&#xD;
"I believe this Gorgon knows where she is," said George.&#xD;
"Look at the gold she is hiding ! I caught her skulking among&#xD;
the trees last night. She hurried out of my sight, and I re-&#xD;
member thinking she looked as if she had just finished some&#xD;
hag's work. Depend upon it, she knows what has become of&#xD;
the simple child whom she hated."&#xD;
"You, Chapeta!" said Uncle Alec, in surprise.&#xD;
"Me, Senor," she answered, snarling, and showing her fangs.&#xD;
"I count my gold. It amuses me when my work is done.&#xD;
What care I for the silly donceleta? I have enough to do to&#xD;
mind my kitchen. I shouldn't follow her, to kiss her foot, for&#xD;
love of her eyes, like the young men who eat at your table,"&#xD;
leering at George.&#xD;
Hilario, gay in -his jaunty dress, came up in his carrafella,&#xD;
humming his favorite song, " The night is not. darker than thy&#xD;
raven hair," and he sought. with his piercing glances for the&#xD;
little maid he hoped to find.&#xD;
"Ah, Hilario, what have you done with Zitella ?" said Uncle&#xD;
Alec. "Speak up, you rogtp  You need not be afraid to own&#xD;
it, if you have gone and married her in . secret, though there&#xD;
wasn't the least need for you to act a sly part. Have you&#xD;
come to mke your peace, and getforgiven?"&#xD;

WHM BECAME 'OF T'EILA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Though he talked in this strain, Uncle Alec saw nothing in&#xD;
the young fellow's face to give him any hope.&#xD;
"Zitella !" exclaimed Hilario, springing to the ground.&#xD;
"What is this that el Seftor speaks ? What has happened?&#xD;
Where is slze?&amp;amp;.&#xD;
" Come, .come, I heard you trolling out your favorite lure&#xD;
last night, and amazingly well you did it. It .is not the first&#xD;
time I've listened to your zittern, nor the first, either, that I've&#xD;
seen Zitella steal out to meet you. I've had my eye: on you.&#xD;
I knew she was' a -good child, and £U took you for an honest&#xD;
fellow, hottempered, and a trifle quarrelsome, but honest ; and&#xD;
.I-meant you should have her after a while. Come, where is&#xD;
she ?".&#xD;
" I do not know,:Seaor. 'I sang no songs last night. I was&#xD;
over the cerros in the Hacienda-del Marie, and I come thence&#xD;
but now."&#xD;
"I amicertain I heard your, song last night, persisted Uncle&#xD;
Alec&#xD;
"Then it was .that *retch Pequillo 1 Cutses light on his&#xD;
treacherous soul&#xD;
Hilario sprang to;'his seat, and drove swiftly away.&#xD;
"I'm afraid he's right," said George. - "I've seen that young&#xD;
Spaniard following Zitella.:about,'holding her flowers-and chat-&#xD;
ting. 1 wish I hadgiven more heed to him, but' somehow out-&#xD;
ward things only:touch And vanish. 1-""&#xD;
"Have you seen Otho this morning," asked Uncle Alec,&#xD;
considering.&#xD;
""Ha ha," laughed old Chapetg, "he knows where the girl&#xD;
is hid ;'he knows.' I'll swear that. She prayed for him by the&#xD;
shrine of the Roses, and she told his name with every bead. I&#xD;
stole up behind her, and I'd.have'beaten her if he had :not&#xD;
come by, and I know she wited there to meet him. Oh ! he&#xD;
&#xD;
WHAT BECAME OF ZITELLA.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
can tell you ; he can 'tell ; ast him- ask. the still man who&#xD;
never speaks. Still water runs deep."&#xD;
Uncle Alec was yet questioning George's face, with aston.&#xD;
ished eyes, when a cry reached them, and men came running&#xD;
swiftly.-&#xD;
" Oh, Seuior 1 Water ! water in the mine !  Lost ! all&#xD;
lost !"&#xD;
He threw himself upon his bracador, and George hastened&#xD;
away to saddle Nis, and the new calamity put Zitella out of&#xD;
their thoughts. Don't you forget her, dear reader,, because we&#xD;
will find her some day, and have a tale about her life and its&#xD;
sad consequences.&#xD;
They reached the -Romanza together, and found a crowd&#xD;
about it.' The pepandores were talking and howling. A fright-&#xD;
ful accident had occurred. A party of miners were- down at&#xD;
their work, and had cut through' the chamber into another mine,&#xD;
which was old and -undrained since the -time of the ancient&#xD;
Mexicans, and the water rushing in had made quick way for&#xD;
itself, and swallowed them up in its surging flood.&#xD;
Our old friend Jason, of-the cars, of whose child Bertha took&#xD;
such care that Rosenbloom journey, was administrador of this&#xD;
Realito, and his face was very pale when they came up, and&#xD;
he was tightening his belt, making ready to descend and search&#xD;
the level.&#xD;
"Mr. Groenveldt is down there, sir," said he, in a low voice,&#xD;
to Uncle Alec.&#xD;
"What ! Otho down there !"&#xD;
"Yes, sir; he. went early this 'morning,' to inspect the Bo-&#xD;
vieda, 'and I was looking for him up, when the wall gave way. I&#xD;
am going to try once more to get down, but I'm afraid 'tis all&#xD;

"Stand back, Jason," said George, putting a hand on .the ad.&#xD;
ministrador's shoulder, and whirling him about. " This is my,&#xD;
work."'&#xD;
"I fear 'tis too late, Mr. Blair, and the walls keep crumb-&#xD;
ling. There isn't a chance for the young gentleman."&#xD;
"I'll go down and fetch Otho Groenveldt, alive or dead !"&#xD;
and before Uncle Alec comprehended the look of hatred on&#xD;
his massive face, he had begun the descent. Twelve hundred&#xD;
steps, for in this mine the men reached their work by stairs,&#xD;
.and went' down in gangs with lighted tapers in their hats, and&#xD;
singing, as they descended, a morning hymn.&#xD;
The frightful dash and roar of the waters below sounded in&#xD;
his ears long before he reached the level, and corpses floated&#xD;
up to his feet. His red "candle lighted only a little circle in&#xD;
the thick darkness, and he shuddered as he recalled the scene&#xD;
in the Realito, among the savage rats. He grasped eagerly&#xD;
the -drifting bodies, and glared his candle in their ghastly faces,&#xD;
seeking the man who had sent him from his home and broken&#xD;
up his life. He listened, and, thought he heard a shout, and&#xD;
then a splash, like one swimming, and in a moment a corpse&#xD;
came to his hand, yet warm with its last heart-throb. It was&#xD;
the last of the poor miners, and the cry he heard was his scream&#xD;
of agony when he dashed out hislife against the rocks. George&#xD;
plunged into the seething flood, and ploughed his way among&#xD;
the wrecks of the traims, the stones, and the ghastly dead, keep-&#xD;
ing his head well up, and every sense alert. He followed the&#xD;
gallery to a little Bovieda, like that where he stumbled upon.&#xD;
the poor pegador, and there, in that innei dungeon, he discov-&#xD;
ered a red light, and getting carefully around to it, he found the&#xD;
man he had perilled his life to seek, clinging to a pillar which,&#xD;
though trembling, still stood the shock of the waters. Otho,&#xD;
who had been standing close to the cutting, inspecting the&#xD;
&#xD;
seams and cracks, trickling with water-drops, and who had his&#xD;
arm raised and his face lifted, pointing out a little spirming&#xD;
stream, which showered spray upon them, when suddenly the&#xD;
waters rushed through, and swept them  into a confused&#xD;
heap against the opposite wall, and hurled them hither, and&#xD;
thither, and in a few minutes Otho 'was surrounded by the&#xD;
dead, who reached out to him with their tossing, limp arms,&#xD;
and the glare of his lamp showed .him their fixed, staring eyes.&#xD;
The urgingg wave beat against him, and though he kept his hold&#xD;
of the rocky pillar, he was counting the moments of his life, for&#xD;
he had a deep gash in his leg, torn by a ragged rock, and his&#xD;
blood was welling from the severed artery. His relaxing hands&#xD;
refused longer to grasp their support,' and he dropped with a&#xD;
splash into the torrent, so close to-George as nearly to extin-&#xD;
guish his torch, which flickered and sputtered, and then flared&#xD;
up again, and the giant caught his enemy around the waist, and&#xD;
made for the staircase. It was dreary work, among the float-&#xD;
ing sticks and dripping human forms, but he reached it at last.&#xD;
Only six hundred steps now, the rest being submerged-; but&#xD;
enough, with a dead man to carry. He stopped and took his&#xD;
burden by the arms, and. swung him upon his back, and com-&#xD;
menced the ascent slowly. Slowly he struggled on, and as his&#xD;
strength gave way he reminded himself who was the burden he&#xD;
was bearing up to the light of day, and steadied his muscles,&#xD;
and clinched-his teeth, and toiled on with fresh resolution. He&#xD;
neared the top, and staggered.. He tried to wet his lips with&#xD;
his parched. tongue, and to shout for help, but his dry throat re-&#xD;
fused to utter a sound. His head spun round like a top. He&#xD;
planted hi feet mechanically, and his trembling. knees bent&#xD;
beneath him. Daylight ! and only thirty steps more.! It might&#xD;
as well have been five hundred, for he reeled, fell ! No ; he&#xD;
caught a rod projecting from the slimy rock, which held in place&#xD;

the narrow stair, and help was at hand. Strong arms seized&#xD;
him, and the two were soon laid softly down upon the green&#xD;
Bermuda: grass at the top of- the shaft, with pallid faces and-&#xD;
shut eyes..&#xD;
A watcher kept vigil in the sick-room. -George Blair hat&#xD;
.quickly: recovered his" manhood,-and. he was nursing Otho&#xD;
through the fearful fever which wag burning up his blood. He&#xD;
hadalready learned a: secret -his enemy's love for Christabel&#xD;
---and'it added f el to the flanie:of his. hatred. He heard her&#xD;
name coupled with his own-Ruthie's, and: endearing words and&#xD;
loving epithets mingled with both, and be believed him a double&#xD;
villain,.and longed for the.hour to arrivewhen he could tell the&#xD;
sick man how he: despised and loathed him - -when he could&#xD;
strike ;his face --purn hWn with his foot; and he .attended him&#xD;
carefully, watching;every breath with greedy anxiety,hoarding up&#xD;
his hate.     ..&#xD;

Othahe might have; died ons the Bermuda grass,had it not been&#xD;
for an .old :Indian docfr, ho was prowlingaround the Ro-&#xD;

lowed his emotions like a sick girl, and took the: bitter bark and&#xD;
'orange-leaf tea without a murmur. He was submissive.&#xD;
" Only half: a' pomegranate,; George  Just' one more chir-&#xD;
&#xD;
moga. I couldn't treat you so. I'm starving, and you give&#xD;
ne no food, and you grudge me a smile."&#xD;
George looked keenly at the pale, wasted fellow, whose dom-&#xD;
inant huniors were 'so subdued, end while he' hated to supply&#xD;
all his wants, he rejoiced, because his tine was -coming. This-&#xD;
sick man, who depended upon his care, whom disease had so&#xD;
robbed of his masterful pride, would be strong again presently,&#xD;
and then-&#xD;
Hilario brought in a letter, and handed it to Otho.&#xD;
"Any news of Zitella,' yet, boy ?" asked George, kindly.&#xD;
"I shall never know the fate'of my pretty betrothed."&#xD;
He went mournfully away.&#xD;
SPoor fellow I he (carries a sore ieart," 'said Otho. " That&#xD;
villain, Pequillo, :deserves':hanging: I hope he will get his&#xD;
desserts.";&#xD;
" If all villains of his stamp were hung, I would toss away my&#xD;
physic,: for my: occupation would be g one," said-George, with a&#xD;
sneer most unbecoming his good, loyal .face, as he placed a&#xD;
luscious peach in his patient s hand.&#xD;
Otho studied him an instant before he' opened his letter; but&#xD;
he was not strong enough to feel inclined to ask questions, or&#xD;
follow any train of "thought, and he looked at the missive 'he&#xD;
held in-his hand.'&#xD;
"From my mother," 'said he." He read a few lines, and laid&#xD;
it down, and shut his eyes, and 'a pained look crept into his&#xD;
'face, and when he opened there again he fixed them upon&#xD;
George, who was absorbed in his thoughts, before he applied&#xD;
himself to it afreshe&#xD;
" This concerns you deeply, good friend," said he, holding it&#xD;
out, with a faint smile. 'His "voice was low and soft, and his&#xD;
sunken eyes were full of' tears  (Sickness makes us weak.)&#xD;

&#xD;
He kept silence till George had read the letter, though his face&#xD;
worked and flushed.&#xD;
"Come, dear, good, conscientious fellow, you've been nurs.&#xD;
ing a man whom you believed a scoundrel. I wonder you&#xD;
didn't leave me to my fate, yonder in the mine, and I, poor&#xD;
short-sighted fool, I took you for an unprincipled rogue, who&#xD;
had left behind him a rare pearl of a wife for greed of gold.&#xD;
Well, we were .neither of us to blame. We can't take any more&#xD;
out of ourselves than God has put into us. I little thought,&#xD;
when I tried to get a sight of Ruthie's face, and offer help and&#xD;
sympathy, that I was the cause of all her sorrow.  Come,&#xD;
George-friend, preserver-take my hand, and believe me&#xD;
when I say that I love your Ruthie with the pure love I give&#xD;
my sister, and I love you dearer than a brother. I know how&#xD;
rich 'and bountiful you are, in every thing that makes a man."&#xD;
The giant dropped the letter, which was a detailed account&#xD;
of the trouble -George's disappearance, and Ruth's life and&#xD;
sufferings, and spirited comments upon.the whole  and a recom-&#xD;
mendation to her son to endeavor to get some plan afoot, by.&#xD;
which the wedded pair might be brought into harmony again,&#xD;
and to bestir himself vigorously in the matter, since he had&#xD;
been used as an instrument of their unhappiness, and some&#xD;
vacillating opinions of the character of Belle Brandon, whiffling&#xD;
between the belief that she was a demon in the shape of&#xD;
female loveliness, and an idea that she might be, after all, only&#xD;
a thoughtless, fun-loving girl, giddy and rash, carrying frolics to&#xD;
the verge of crimes.&#xD;
George sank upon his knees by the bed-side, and his great&#xD;
frame. shook with his sobs. "My poor, poor'Ruthie ! how she&#xD;
has suffered !" were the first words he uttered. Half an hour&#xD;
later,. he left his patient, composed and quiet, and the two men&#xD;
were friends for life  such loving, tender friends that people&#xD;
&#xD;
wondered when, by chance, they saw them exchanging hugs&#xD;
and kisses like women.  No matter how proud and distant&#xD;
Otho was to others, George got-always soul-full tenderness.&#xD;
The giant came out upon the broad veranda, where Uncle&#xD;
Alec was smoking, with his feet upon Dohle, while the tame&#xD;
tapir's calf rooted his hand.&#xD;
"Mr. Craigenfels," said he, like a school-boy asking a holi-&#xD;
day, " I want to go home."&#xD;
" Had pie enough ?" asked Uncle Alec, laughing. He re-&#xD;
ferred to an old story he was fond of telling, about a -bashful&#xD;
lover, who went to visit his sweetheart, and instead of making&#xD;
love, set in a corner and twiddled his thumbs. Finding she&#xD;
could get nothing out of him, Miss Nancy bethought herself to&#xD;
feed the animal, and she plied him with pie, which he took be-&#xD;
cause he was too diffident to refuse. He finished one ; she&#xD;
brought another ; he swallowed the last piece, stuffed to the&#xD;
lips, but still thankful to have exhausted the supply, and wiped&#xD;
his mouth on his bandana, when lo1 she appeared on the&#xD;
threshold bearing a third f He stumbled to his feet, toes in,&#xD;
elbows. out, and his face screwed into a piteous snarl. "I don't&#xD;
want no more pie1 'I want to go home 1".said he.&#xD;
George was too deeply moved to smile at Uncle Alec's fun,&#xD;
who looked at him observing how all alive he was, and the old&#xD;
fellow felt happy. His troubles and worries were about to end.&#xD;
And when the giant said,-"I want to see Ruthie, sir. I" must&#xD;
start immediately," he was sure that a man who could speak&#xD;
his wife's name with'uch a thrill as that, must be a good fellow,&#xD;
ready to take up all his duties and responsibilities; and the&#xD;
doubts and fears he' had been, carrying, a' heavy, wearisome&#xD;
load, dropped off like Christian's urden. His vicarious suf-&#xD;
ferings were needed no more. Ruth had a good husband, and&#xD;

George a good wife, That one, answer .proved it, backed by&#xD;
the true: soul which set throned in the young giant's eyes.&#xD;
" Well, I callthat odd, now ! Here you have been all these&#xD;
months, and nothing could I get out of you, for all my cross-&#xD;
questioning.", (Deeply as George was stirred, he could not&#xD;
help smiling at the idea of cross-questioning from his genial&#xD;
host, who had so much respected his young friend's reticence&#xD;
as never to make one inquiry.) "And here you burst out all&#xD;
of a sudden, and you must. go home.!"&#xD;
"I have been a deuced fool, Mr. Craigenfels ! and my wife&#xD;
is an angel -- a poor broken-hearted girl!, but I can't talk about&#xD;
it- yet.. When I haveset things straight, and am my own man,&#xD;
in my own place again, I'll tell you the whole -story; but I&#xD;
must start directly, sir.".&#xD;
" We'll all go, my boy," said Uncle Alec, cheerily, tossing&#xD;
away his segar. "I am delighted to hear you say so. Otho&#xD;
has got enough of Mexican mining for the present, and I should&#xD;
like an excuse to get back to Craigenfels, and-will be off in a&#xD;
couple of days. We'll swing our sick man into a hammock,&#xD;
and put him between four stout fellows, and.you and I will lake&#xD;
our horses, and by the time we reach the post he'll be a new&#xD;
creature, and the voyage wm  set him, up completely : and, by&#xD;
the way, what do you suppose was in that box we took out of&#xD;
his pocket, afteryou fished him up ? ,Look here - not that it&#xD;
makes a great deal of difference, only you might like to get your&#xD;
title from your, father better than me --- that Romanza, where you&#xD;
went fishing,, like St. Peter, and caught your man, is yours of&#xD;
right., Otho picked this box out of a queer chest he found in&#xD;
the Bovieda, all rust and falling to pieces. Mercy only knows&#xD;
the motive of the hider -- some deviltry, very likely ; but there&#xD;
it is ! You have, often told me your father sunk his property&#xD;
in an old silver mine, and that the title was stolen from him"&#xD;
&#xD;
uSo he did, sir ; but the title had lost all value, for the&#xD;
machinery was too light for. the work, and he had sunk his&#xD;
money in the nasty hole, which was as full of black mud and&#xD;
dirty water as it is to-day."&#xD;
" Very likely, George. I know quite well that 'much coin&#xD;
is hushed, within the hollow mine of earth at present, whichwas&#xD;
sucked down by bad management or ripe dishonesty.; But=&#xD;
know how the Realito pays for working, and what engines we&#xD;
have to pump it clear again. You had best continue good Ja-&#xD;
son in his office during your absence, and you may draw on me&#xD;
for funds to drain, and start afresh.. I fully believe the mine is&#xD;
exhaustless,,and I must congratulate you upon such a Romanza,.&#xD;
well named prosperity. Only, be mercifulas to arrears, good&#xD;
George, because you must consider that for ten years I have&#xD;
believed the property my own."&#xD;
"Am. I a rich man, Mr. Craigenfels ?  Oh, Ruthie ! dear,&#xD;
good, loving Ruthie.! let me live to make up to her a little of&#xD;
the misery I have caused her, and the bitter, wicked wrong I&#xD;
have done."&#xD;
George,. the athlete, ho towered above his fellows, who re-&#xD;
joiced in his, strength, covered his face. with his hands, and&#xD;
sobbed like a boy. And Uncle Alec, who generally had coun,&#xD;
sel and cheeriness for everybody, was fain to keep silence in&#xD;
his presence, and to "wipe his weeping eyes."  And so it was&#xD;
that Otho met Chris, at Wallack's, where they played Rosedale,&#xD;
wearing Max's bracelet of sapphires -upon her arm.&#xD;

132    THE WIDOW HUGEL Y EN7O YS HERSELF.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
THE- WIDOW HUGELY ENJOYS HERSELF.&#xD;
OHN    PEEBLES declined Uncle Alec's invitation, so&#xD;
pressing, to accompany the young ladies to Craigen.&#xD;
fels. The poor young fellow had asked a question in&#xD;
the great drawing-room of the St. James, and got his answer;.&#xD;
and after a sleepless night, he had made up his mind to try to&#xD;
feed his soul on Greek roots, and take the professorship which&#xD;
awaited him  at , the end of his college course, and eschew&#xD;
women forever. Chris went up and played once more, Max's&#xD;
song-&#xD;
"There wandered a lady upon the strand,&#xD;
Her fair hair bound with a golden band."&#xD;
And there was a little sore spot in her heart as she remem.&#xD;
bered him, the yellow-haired, composed and stately, whom she&#xD;
could have liked so much for a friend ; and the-last notes of&#xD;
the refrain still trembled on her lips, when Otho Groenveldt&#xD;
came striding in, his overcoat upon his arm, and valise in hand.&#xD;
He scanned 'her gray suit, shepherdess's hat, embroidered reti-&#xD;
cule, and the dainty gloves she had laid upon the piano, while&#xD;
her fingers were busy with their farewell to the St. James, and&#xD;
said,.-&#xD;
" How much time have we, Miss -Goldsmith?"&#xD;
" Titne for what, sir?",she asked, in alarm.-&#xD;
" Before starting, of course. Perhaps you are not aware&#xD;
that I intend to make one of your party to Craigenfels. In-&#xD;
deed, I did not decide it till about fifteen minutes ago."&#xD;
Chris's trembling fingers went astray among the keys, and&#xD;
she gazed at the blank wall before her, determined to exhibit&#xD;
no emotion. '&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WIDOW HUGELY EN-OYS HERSELF.           3&#xD;
"That was a very old melody you were singing -not-to be&#xD;
found in young ladies' music books nowadays, I think. May&#xD;
I ask you where you learned it?"&#xD;
Chris looked at him. , He had come around, and was leaning&#xD;
on the piano, in front of her, and she felt sure- he had heard&#xD;
Max sing Sintram's song. His face said as much, antd 'she re-&#xD;
plied quietly, giving, the while, close attention to the sharps of&#xD;
the arpeggios she was trying,-&#xD;
" Dr. Max sung it here one morning, while he was waiting&#xD;
to see me."&#xD;
Zoe came in, chatting to Sabrina and Bertha, Peter fol-&#xD;
lowing with bags and parcels, which he deposited on a sofa,&#xD;
and they all compared their watches.&#xD;
"Just in time for a nice song, Bertha," said Zoe. " Come,&#xD;
Chris, give place, if you please. This cantatrice is about to&#xD;
render the Tyrolean echo and jodel."&#xD;
"I think Bertha will not choose to sing in a hotel parlor,"&#xD;
said Otho, quickly.&#xD;
"Whynot, pray, when she has her dearest friends for audi-&#xD;
ence ?" demanded Zoe, facing about.&#xD;
"That is a whim peculiar to my super-fastidious brother,"&#xD;
answered Bertha, with' a mollifying laugh; "he is so afraid I&#xD;
shall be "conspicuous, and that would entail the probability, you&#xD;
see, of his being pointed out as my kinsman."&#xD;
Zoe wheeled about, uttering a petulant exclaation, which&#xD;
was not flattering to the young doctor. And Christabel 'rose&#xD;
from the piano, looking and .feeling offended with the -pointed&#xD;
reproof, and withdrew to the window, where she 'was soon&#xD;
joined by Sonsie, who studied her face, seeking the 'happiness&#xD;
she lacked'the power to bestow upon her "white angel,"'whom&#xD;
she ardently desired to see always in harmony with herself.&#xD;
She discovered only stormy discontent and unrest' there now,&#xD;

certainly no business of his; and: then she heard Belle Brandon&#xD;
conversing gayly with Uncle Alec, who had been to fetch her&#xD;
and just come in with her on his arm, and in high feather. And&#xD;
poor ,Chris felt sure that. the nice month she had hoped for&#xD;
was spoiled, and the object of her thoughts came up and&#xD;
offered her a couple of books which he extended with a smile.&#xD;
"A pair of old friends, 'believe, Miss Goldsmith. You se-&#xD;

" Indeed, Miss Goldsmith, I had no such intention. Pray&#xD;
do me the justice to believe it."&#xD;
Now he had.got an advantage, and he reaped a benefit' from.&#xD;
it, and made the most of it, for Chris'was so sorry and ashamed&#xD;
of her rude speech, that' she carried herself quite humblydur-&#xD;
in the half hour of waiting.&#xD;
Zoe came up and thrust 'her hand into' Sonsie's, and 'pulled&#xD;
her away into a corner, and'- Jan 'joined them, and the three&#xD;
stood whispering over a magnificent set of opals which the lit-&#xD;
tle Gypsy had purchased for Sabrina,"out of revenge," she. said,&#xD;
"for calling me names," and Belle floated up.to them&#xD;
" Excuse 'me, Zoe; cherie, but 'I think I 'have' dropped my&#xD;
mouchoir on the stairs ; may I' send your maid tofetch it?"&#xD;
Jan colored indignantly,'and Zoe haughtily replied,-&#xD;
"If you mean my friend Sonsie, with whom you see. me&#xD;
busily talking, I must tell you that I cannot spare her 'for any&#xD;
errands, and you-had better go yourself, perhaps."&#xD;
Sonsie was regarding steadfastly Jan Vedder during this col-&#xD;
oquy, and trying to discover whether any spark of his love for&#xD;
the blonde still remained, and' she felt quite :sure that itas&#xD;
dead, yea, and forgotten; andfor some unaccountable reason,&#xD;
she was glad to know it, and her spirits rosewith the knowl-&#xD;

"Oh, do not disturb yourself, Sonsie. I'll hunt the handker.&#xD;
chief for Miss Brandon, and of course. I shall claim the usual&#xD;
reward at the close of the little game. It is out of fashion to&#xD;
do something for nothing."&#xD;
Belle took in the relative situation of the parties at once, and&#xD;
foresaw plenty of nice opportunities for enjoying her favorite&#xD;
amusement. -Jan Vedder's ring was on her finger at that&#xD;
moment. She had nearly forgotten the young man's existence,&#xD;
till she met him so gushingly in the St. James parlor. She had&#xD;
her hands full with an absorbing scheme, but she reserved some&#xD;
cutting flings for him.&#xD;
Chris's conversation in the window was so absolutely enjoya-&#xD;
ble, that she 'forgot her vexation, her past, every thing, in the&#xD;
pleasure -of hearing Otho talk, and it was- not till they were&#xD;
summoned to the carriage that her dreary loneliness settled&#xD;
down afresh upon her. Belle remarked, gushingly,-&#xD;
"It really. seems like old times, to- see you two together. We&#xD;
used to call them Pyramus and Thisbe, Mr. Craigenfels, such&#xD;
enwrapped talkers as they were."&#xD;
The beautiful blonde was thoughtful, full five minutes after&#xD;
she had got her seat by Uncle Alec in the car, trying to solve,&#xD;
the meaning of the look she received from Otho, in exchange&#xD;
for her bit of innocent waggery, and Chlri' was effeetually si-&#xD;
lenced. Little Mrs. Vedder had overworked in New York, and&#xD;
was ill all the first day of the journey, and lay on her big boy's&#xD;
arm, her eyes shut and her forehead contracted with pain; and-&#xD;
really and truly, Jan had never been so interesting to Sonsie as&#xD;
while she watched'him petting his pretty young mother so ten-&#xD;
derly, his soft hat pushed back over his thick curls, and his&#xD;
thoughts busy about her comfort,. and she readily ran his er-&#xD;
rands and felt absolute-symripathy with:them both.. , They were&#xD;
nearing Roaring River now, and Chrxis had been to the full ast&#xD;

uneasy and uncomfortable as even Belle could have desired.&#xD;
After watching for some time the antics of a couple of thil.-&#xD;
dren, who were jubilant over their journey, she went across ard&#xD;
sat down by Uncle Alec.&#xD;
"I wish I was a little girl, going-somewhere, like those over&#xD;
"there. They make frolics out of every thing. Their rising up&#xD;
and sitting down is funny, and the absolute possession of that&#xD;
window to open and shut every other minute-is an untring&#xD;
joy.,&#xD;
." You, pet ! why, you are a little girl."&#xD;
" Oh, no ! not careless and gay like those."&#xD;
" That won't come back in this world, pet. AMhen we get to&#xD;
heaven we shall all be young."&#xD;
" I don't see how that can- be, Uncle Alec. I can't ever&#xD;
know any less than I know now, iior. feel any less; and as for&#xD;
being light-hearted, the time for me to be pleased-with a rattle,&#xD;
and tickled with a straw, is gone forever, anywhere, Vn sure.&#xD;
It is the soul, singing for gladness, that I long for."&#xD;
Uncle Alec put his arm around her, and leaned her -head&#xD;
against his shoulder.&#xD;
"There, there, rest a little, pet. You are going somewhere&#xD;
you are going home with me."&#xD;
After a struggle with herself; and some reflection, she whis-&#xD;
pered in his ear. He took off his Scotch cap, and stroked his&#xD;
long, silky beard, looking down into her eyes, before {he re-&#xD;
plied, -&#xD;
" Certainly not, my queenie! I'll drive you down to-mor-&#xD;
row; or you may ride Zephyr'; but yotu are iny guest for'his&#xD;
vacation. I shall hold onto my prerogative."&#xD;
She 'dropped -her dace,'and her eyes filled.  She was trying to&#xD;
cast from her this sense of quiet security, and kind, atteritie&#xD;

tion she knew was needful, and her red lips settled into their&#xD;
firmest contour; but she could, not quite speak it yet, her true&#xD;
reasons were so very difficult to put into words. - The woods&#xD;
and rocks sped past them, and Roaring River pealed his reso.&#xD;
nant song, and a mile or two more would bring them to the&#xD;
station.&#xD;
"I must, Uncle Alec," said Chris, raising her head, and look.&#xD;
ing into his good,. kind. face. " You 'will not be angry, I know,&#xD;
even if I fail to keep my promise to you. I fear I shall have&#xD;
very chilly welcome, but that is the place for me."&#xD;
The genial old fellow followed a stray eye-beam, which lighted&#xD;
upon the grave young doctor, absorbed in his "Eclectic," his&#xD;
face stern and unsmiling, and he made up his mind to ask him.&#xD;
a straight question, as soon as he got the opportunity. In the&#xD;
meantimelhe said caressingly,---&#xD;
" Must you, little pet? Well, well, we'll see about it. You&#xD;
shall stay just where you can most enjoy your play-time. I'll&#xD;
manage to get you pretty often, and you shall have Zephyrfor&#xD;
yours. Either way, I'm glad you like Zephyr, pet, and I shall&#xD;
,admire you on his back, I know. Your papa talked much about&#xD;
your horsemanship, and he meant you to have a beauty of your,&#xD;
own, and a span for your curricle. I shall have to attend to&#xD;
those things as soon as you leave school.  Il be your papa.&#xD;
Oh dear ! I didn't mean to make you cry. here, there! don't-&#xD;
spoil your pretty eyes. We'll have a good little time. Here&#xD;
we are. Now thent"&#xD;
Belle exulted openly when she heard the order given to drive&#xD;
to Brookside. She had- tried many ways of ascertaining just&#xD;
how the party was to be disposed of. She had an idea that&#xD;
Chris and Sonsie were going up to Craigenfels, and she wanted&#xD;
a clear field for her "little game," therefore she was delighted to&#xD;
find that they were to be dropped on the way, and she counted&#xD;

she.&#xD;
It was just at evening, misty and quiet, when the Celtic lassie&#xD;
followed Chris into the carriage, after bidding a meiry good-&#xD;
night to Jan and his mother, and refusing lightly their offers of&#xD;
assistance, and gayly parrying their pressing invitation to ac-&#xD;
company them to Brookedge, "where," said Mrs. Vedder,&#xD;
" there's a nice room, all in white, looking out to the river and&#xD;
the boat-house, that would just suit you."&#xD;
"Many thanks, ma'am," replied Sonsie ; "me service bein'&#xD;
up wid Miss Zoe, I am just after biddin' her good-by, and I'll&#xD;
go back to me old mistress till school-time comes ; but it is very&#xD;
kind of ye, and I'm iver so glad I went in yer company. I've&#xD;
got a deal of idication amongst all the teachin' things.. And&#xD;
Mr. Jan too ; I think you've got a little, also, sir, and I'll run&#xD;
down in the morn to Mrs. Slocum's, and inquire how comes on&#xD;
the siven children we sent her. Wasn't it a brave letter that&#xD;
he, wrote you, sir ?  Oh! I like Captain Slocum!"&#xD;
Sonsie let Chris out of her arms when the carriage stopped,&#xD;
and kissed her hand as she bade her good-night, and Uncle Alec&#xD;
took her up the long avenue.&#xD;
"I don't fancy this break-up in my plans, child, at all, but&#xD;
I'll not say 'n  to Fred's daughter, if she were as full of&#xD;
whims as a ros  of leaves, though it may be you are right.&#xD;
There is a duty you owe your mother, and you are a good little&#xD;
girl, to be willing to put yourself outside of all the frolics up&#xD;
there, so as to fulfil it."&#xD;
" Oh, Uncle Alec ! It isn't that," stammered Chris, who&#xD;
felt that she did not deserve his praise, "but-I cannot tell&#xD;
you indeed."&#xD;

many pleasant hours, where Chandy had been so kind and so&#xD;
tormenting, and the place was full of them. There was not an&#xD;
article of furniture but spoke of those last months, so. complete,&#xD;
and from which she had drifted so far away.&#xD;
The widow sat before a little table, a pencil in her hand, at&#xD;
work upon some papers, statements, and bonds, which she hud-&#xD;
dled into;her big Bible as she heard the approaching footsteps.&#xD;
"I've o ine, home, mother !" said Chris, feeling the glamour&#xD;
of her pareit's presence, as if she were a child under the iron&#xD;
rule once more ; " I've come home; will you-not give me .a&#xD;
little kiss, and say you are glad to see me?"&#xD;
" The land sakes alive !" ejaculated the fond mother, jerk-&#xD;
ing her head back from her child's proffered lips. "Glad ! I&#xD;
don't tell no lies. What're you home for ? I should admire&#xD;
to know! Walkin' in unbeknown, like a strollin' tramp, this&#xD;

"Done wrong   Yes, you have. What b    ss had you to&#xD;

.Yes, mother; that is, I saw Chandy' letters. You never&#xD;

they urged me so much. Don't take it "hard. This is Uncle&#xD;

"Yes, madam.   Good-evening, madan. 'I brought your&#xD;
daughter," said Uncle Alec, waving his Scotch cap indig-&#xD;
nantly at her, "and I propose to see her'safely returned among&#xD;
her friends in due time. Her feeling"of respectful duty to you&#xD;
-- a feeling which I never honored in her as I do at this moment&#xD;
- a most remarkable emotion, madain -I say, her respectful&#xD;
duty to her mother interfered-with my plan, which. to.give&#xD;
the over-worked scholar a little pleasure up at  aigenfels.&#xD;
She, good child, insisted upon coming to her fath  :house in-&#xD;
stead of mine, which is also hers any time she will' do me' the&#xD;
pleasure to use it."&#xD;
" The land sakes. What highfaluten folderols!" answered&#xD;
the widow, glowering unpleasantly at the old fellow's silken&#xD;
beard and ruddy face, and his bright eyes, which were just now&#xD;
kindled with peculiar light. " I've heard folks talk before, and&#xD;
you are very much mistaken, sirI can tell you-! She'hain't&#xD;
got no, ight just now, except where she come from, and if it's&#xD;

Chris was looking at the widow during this affectionate&#xD;
speech, and sec _ wonderingg if she had always been so ugly.&#xD;
But the perfectionist had progressed in her absence,-and had&#xD;
got so far in her sort of piety at to reject all outward adorn-&#xD;

and false hair, and event her beloved spit-curls were pasted&#xD;
back, and -her scanty gray locks were dragged together and tied&#xD;

had returned' unbidden. She had got her now at her mercy,&#xD;
no Chandos to interfere and be troublesome or loving to the&#xD;
poor child, who would be forced to take up just such a life as&#xD;
she chose to throw at her, and as she mentally said, while de-&#xD;
vouring her with glances, "to put her through a course of&#xD;

" Must I leave school, motherr" asked Chris, in alarm.&#xD;
" Don't say that. I cannot do it."&#xD;
" Can't ? how're you goin' to help yourself? You have left&#xD;

" It appears that you do not quite comprehend the situation,&#xD;

superhuman efforts to keep cool.&#xD;
"This is vacation-time, when the young ladies visit their rel-&#xD;

" I'll sweeten it for her ! She won't want no merlasses."&#xD;

burst out, -&#xD;
"Ye gods and little fishes! I don't wonder poor'red died!&#xD;

when he saw the driver leaving the trunk according to direc-&#xD;
tions, and he dashed out after him.&#xD;
"Here, you fellow ! fetch away that luggage. It don't be-&#xD;
long here. Craigenfels is the place," and he followed the&#xD;
grumbling hackman back to the house to make sure his orders&#xD;
were obeyed.&#xD;
"Let that there box be ! and take yourself off,"'screamed&#xD;
the wvidow ; "and you, Christabel, you come rightback into&#xD;
the house. What d'ye mean ! trampin' off along of that strange&#xD;
man ? Ain't you ashamed ?"&#xD;
As the driver said afterwards, when relating the story in the&#xD;
stable office, "The old beauty sot down on the trunk, and I&#xD;
thought I'd let her sot, and I did."&#xD;
"Thank Heaven 1"You are a strange woman, madam.&#xD;
Whatever sort of man I may be, Fred's daughter has got&#xD;
friends. She shall not stop here, to be brow-beaten and ill&#xD;
treated, while Craigenfels stands on yonder hill; and as for the&#xD;
box, you can sit there till morning, if you like. There are dry&#xD;
goods enough in Millville to fill another, I suppose, and if not,&#xD;
we'll get over a lot from Paris. I wish you a very good even-&#xD;

The widow was triumphantly belligerent. She had alarge&#xD;
amount of pungent juices hoarded up, withered as she looked,&#xD;
and of the bitterest sort. In fact, they had found no natural&#xD;
outlet since her daughter's departure, and she was enjoying&#xD;
herself hugely.&#xD;
"What have you got to say about it ? If you had wanted to&#xD;
order children roind, you'd orter got married, and had some&#xD;
of yer own. My girl's come back of her own accord, and: you&#xD;
just empty her out of that there 'tea, double-quick.  She'&#xD;

Y ur soul."&#xD;
"9She -shall ! "&#xD;
"wShe shan't/"&#xD;
-SHALL1"&#xD;
"SHE SHAN'T!"&#xD;
Chris could only guess the tenor of this, pleasant dialogue,&#xD;
as she laysobbing in Sonsie's arms, not daring to go back, and&#xD;
not daring to go on. Uncle Alec came striding down the ave-&#xD;
nue, pulled open the door, shut it with a slain-bang, and threw&#xD;
himself upon the cushion.&#xD;
"Oh, Uncle Alec ! how dreadful this is. Do let me get-&#xD;
out. , I must not go with you. Oh, why did I come at all."&#xD;
"Don't take on, pet.) You have done nothing wrong ; it is&#xD;

This was a very mild ending of the old. fellow's sentence,&#xD;
compared with what rose to his lips ; very, indeed.&#xD;
They stopped at the Horseshoe, and Sohsie, who, it seemed,&#xD;
must have bestowed no end of her magnetism upon her "white&#xD;
angel,". who was composed, and comforted by her companion-&#xD;
ship, impressed a final kiss upon the hand Ae. held, and mur-&#xD;
mured a fervent prayer over it, and then jumped -out into the&#xD;
darkness, promising to come up on the morrow,-and she and&#xD;
Uncle Alec stood on the porch waiting for admission. - -&#xD;
"Roukie, it seems. not fair for you to cut loosefrom-s in&#xD;

a tough -interview, I can tell yon, with that old .lady. I wish&#xD;
I could make you see your way clear to keeping with. us. I&#xD;
know it would be, of no use to coax, unless you feel the pro-&#xD;
priety of the act."&#xD;
"Indeed, then, I think I'm not to get in here at all!" an-&#xD;
swered Sonsie, peering under the curtain. The house is si-&#xD;
lent, and even the dog is away. I wonder what ever it can&#xD;
mean. Miss Ruthie usen't at all. to go abroad at night."&#xD;
"Nothing alarming, I dare say.  Perhaps some business&#xD;
took her to Toptown. Her money is deposited there, I&#xD;
know ; but it is evident the place is empty, so you will be&#xD;
obliged to have our company. Come, leave off prying abo t,&#xD;
and calling absent people, .and stirring up the sleepy ehoes,&#xD;
and get into the carriage. There is a.lady inside who-wilsbe&#xD;
glad to have you back, and. I'll send Thomas down inb the&#xD;
morning and find out all about Ruthie, or I'll drive you myself.&#xD;
I dare say she'll be home by that time, and you can pick up&#xD;
the service you long for so ardently."&#xD;
Chris, utterly fagged, went straight to bed, without seeing&#xD;
anybody except Deb, .who came and petted; her, and hushed&#xD;
her sobs, for the poor child was a little hysterical, in spite of&#xD;
Sonsie's magnetism, and held. her on -her motherly old-breast;&#xD;
where Bessie used to lie ; and, Deb longed to know what it all&#xD;
mneant ; why her-darling young lady suffered, and why she was&#xD;
permitted to stayin:hidinglike. ac1prit, when the. others were&#xD;

Thomas, she could not sleep for talking about the two -girls in&#xD;
the tower-chamber, looking up the mountain to- the little&#xD;
church-whose spire pointed toward Heaven.&#xD;

HRIS'S eyes were heavy, and her step languid, when&#xD;
she descended to breakfast. Otho was waiting in the&#xD;
hall, and offered his hand.&#xD;
"You have slept ill," said he, studying her face.&#xD;
" I was over-tired last night," she re lied, turning away,&#xD;
his tone was so kind..&#xD;
"A walk in this good, bracing air wi 1 suit you. I must&#xD;
have you to come up the mountain, and we will look in at the&#xD;
little church, and say our prayers together."&#xD;
Chris met his glance, friendly and positive, his smile so&#xD;
grave. and yet so restful-sweet, and she felt that he was mer-&#xD;
ciless. Determined to have his own way, and take his old&#xD;
position, and make all her words in the great ball-room at&#xD;
Rosenbloom of none effect, as far as suited his humor, and she&#xD;
withdrew her hand.&#xD;
"'I've already -disposed of my morning, Mr. Groenveldt,"&#xD;
said she, and passed on into the breakfast-parlor.&#xD;
"You here 1" exclaimed Belle, arching her handsome brows.&#xD;
" I had no 'idea we were to be favored with your delightful so-&#xD;
ciety at so early a- stage of the proceedings." Truly you must&#xD;
have risen betimes."&#xD;
&#xD;
"About fifteen minutes ago, I, think," replied Chris, coolly.&#xD;
" Ah, you sly Chris,"-spoke up Bertha, with a little squeeze&#xD;
of her friend's waist, "you came up last night, and never let&#xD;
us know ! That is so nice ! I told Uncle Alec to beg and&#xD;
plead, and take no denial."&#xD;
"I did," said the host, who came in just in time to hear her&#xD;
speak, "I did. I wrestled with the angel, and I prevailed."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh, dear Mr. Craigenfels ! This is so perfectly charm-&#xD;
ing !" said Belle, going up with both hands out; "absolutely&#xD;
gorgeous. Now we may play at housekeeping, may we not?&#xD;
I do so love to sit at the head of the table, and give orders.&#xD;
We had a magnificent dinner up here last summer, sir, but you&#xD;
were not present then to round the charm. Chris remembers&#xD;
all about that day, don't you, cherie? and what fun we had&#xD;
telling fortunes with the daisies. You do, I am sure, Bertha,&#xD;
Chandos was so gay, and quite devoted to you, but he had not&#xD;
seen Dolores then, you know. IEA, bien / such is life.  Au-&#xD;
jourd'hui tout, demain rien: do come with me and fetch a&#xD;
breakfast-posy. I am afraid of your gardener; but you will&#xD;
not let him hurt me, will you ? and you shall force him to give&#xD;
me some -shall I say pansies, Mr. Groenveldt?"&#xD;
"You can say any thing you please, Miss Brandon," replied&#xD;
Otho, pointedly.&#xD;
"That 'person is as cross as two sticks this morning, isn't&#xD;
he ?" said Belle, pushing her hand within her host's arm.&#xD;
"Travelling tries people's tempers. Do you know, if I were&#xD;
going to be married, I should like 'to take a journey witl the&#xD;
perhaps first,,as a test.  You are so charming a traveller, Mr.&#xD;
Craigenfels ! Really, I don't see how you. can ever leave this&#xD;
delightsome old place ; but it is only we poor houseless, home-&#xD;
less little wretches, who knob how to prize home."  She&#xD;
heaved a deep sigh.&#xD;

If I had half a dozen such young ladies as Miss Brandon&#xD;
to keep me company, I could never tire of it," said Uncle&#xD;
Alec, pleasantly.&#xD;
"Half a dozen, sir !" pouting very prettily. " Am I of the&#xD;
variety which is counted by the half-dozen! I don't like that&#xD;
--there!"&#xD;
"Oh no,, dear child," laughed Uncle Alec; "you should&#xD;
reign supreme."&#xD;
Belle threw a gushing glance, into his eyes, bewitchingly&#xD;
pleading, and Uncle. Alec was still enjoying the sweetness of&#xD;
it, when Thomas came up, and said, -&#xD;
"Breakfast is served, sir."&#xD;
'one along, little simplicity, who wishes to be 'one only;'&#xD;
bring your flowers with you, and begin your housekeeping.&#xD;
Let me see how you will look at the head of my table.. Come,&#xD;
my child."&#xD;
Belle, veiled her eyes beneath their long lashes, lest her ex.&#xD;
ultation should be too apparent, and replied .in a .very low&#xD;
tone, -&#xD;
" If- only you would- not call me your child, sir; it makes&#xD;
me feel such a baby, as if you looked down on me."&#xD;
"Whatshadl   say, 'my precious darling ' ?" asked he, much&#xD;
amused with her artless navete.&#xD;
"That sounds much nicer," she answered; lifting her eyes in&#xD;
absolute, candor. "Say it in Spanish, please, Mr. Craigenfels."&#xD;
"Ja mia Tortolita frecios  -how do your like that?"&#xD;
" It is very sweet on your tongue, sir.": She repeated the&#xD;
yords in her soft accents, making .mistakes and getting cor-&#xD;
reget. " Will yo  te clpue Spanish, sir ?"&#xD;
"Yer willingly my preiou turted.4ove; that is 'what you&#xD;
have just called yourself.- None of te, ,egoritas 'have such&#xD;
beauty as you. I like our girls best."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
,Belle paused before the mirror, hanging on his arm, and&#xD;
smiled to his image.&#xD;
"I am glad my face pleases you.' I have never forgotten&#xD;
yours. It was very good of you to fetch me to this grand old&#xD;
house.  I hate bustle, and parties, and all that ; quiet happiness&#xD;
is so full of content."&#xD;
She took the place he offered, and proceeded to discharge&#xD;
its duties with charming grace., His, turquoise brooch was at&#xD;
her throat, and the bunch of hyacinths'he plucked for her were&#xD;
in her flower-vase.  She lifted it occasionally, and inhaled their&#xD;
odor, and-then he, sitting opposite, saw her beautiful eyes above&#xD;
them, looking smilingly at him, and her creamy face, framed&#xD;
with soft, light floating hair, and he thought for the hundredth&#xD;
time, "a most lovely child."&#xD;
Sonsie came in after- they were all seated --_indeed,.far pro.&#xD;
gressed in their repast.  She had risen early, and been all over&#xD;
the farm-yards, inspected the chicken coops, lookedinto the&#xD;
stables, churned Deb's butter, seen the cheese into press, milked&#xD;
a couple of cows for Thomas, and received a bunch of choice&#xD;
flowers for her "white angel," as a reward, and she walked&#xD;
briskly - fresh, violet-eyed -and she' smiled as she held out&#xD;
the posy, close clasped in her little fist.  Chris also smiled, and&#xD;
put up her lips, for a kiss, as she accepted the love-offering.&#xD;
" Sweet peas on tiptoe for a flight,&#xD;
With wings of gentleflush; so delicate white;&#xD;
Andtaper fingers, catching at all things,,&#xD;
To bind them all about witi twining rings."&#xD;
said she, pointing to the chair at her side, over which Sonsie&#xD;
leaned an instant, her attention concentrated upon Chris and&#xD;
her poetry, trying to, secure every word, rank and file, so that at&#xD;
first she scarcely heard Belle Brandon' s voice.&#xD;

Is this an enchanted castle, where one gets just what one wishes&#xD;
for?  Do you know, sir, it was on my lips to say that our game&#xD;
of housekeeping could hardly be complete without that very&#xD;
girl (pointing to Sonsie), who excels in waiting, as indeed she&#xD;
should, for Itrained her to adroitness, and quick zeal, and lo-!&#xD;
I lift my eyes, and there she stands, all ready to begin her&#xD;
duties.' It savors of magic, indeed; it is very kind of you, sir.&#xD;
You certainly are the perfection of a host." *&#xD;
Sonsie was looking full into the blonde's cloudless faceas she&#xD;
finished, and her own lost all its crimson.&#xD;
" Augh ! is it me, that ye'd be flyin' at as wicked as a weasel,&#xD;
Miss Belle? Sorra a fancy have I for being a maid to the likes&#xD;
of ye, then. I am obedient to Mr. Craigenfels just now, who&#xD;
ordered me to his table, to sit beside Miss Chris ; but rather&#xD;
than eat meat with one I know quite well, I'll go out to the&#xD;
kitchen, where there's a couple of honest old hearts beatin' wid&#xD;
goodness. Excuse me, sir."&#xD;
"Sit down, Roukie," said Uncle Alec, whose face was as red&#xD;
as if he had said an unpleasant thing; and he deeply regrett d&#xD;
Belle's innocent mistake, and blamed himself that he had n t&#xD;
told her Sonsie's position. Poor city child, where Irish girls&#xD;
were invariably Irish servants, how could she possibly under-&#xD;
stand any other phase of Celtic life than the one she was&#xD;
familiar with ? "&#xD;
".Sit down, my child ! Miss Brandon meant no offence to our&#xD;
gentle blood. You are an O'Rouke, and my first cousin and&#xD;
honored-guest."&#xD;
Bertha sat perfectly still, with shocked face, and Sonsie had&#xD;
turned her back upon them all, and reached the door, with her&#xD;
head up, stepping briskly, when Otho sprang forward, and&#xD;
caught her hand.&#xD;
" Do not permit that girl to triumph over you, Sonsie,"&#xD;
&#xD;
said he, with kind authority. "Come to the table instantly,&#xD;
and behave as if she were not there. You must, or you will&#xD;
most seriously hurt and offend Mr. Craigenfels, and slight us all,&#xD;
besides doing an injustice to yourself.&#xD;
" They say bad news travels wid hare's feet, Mr. Groenreldt.&#xD;
I've a couple of minds to speak out what I know of that young&#xD;
lady and her doings. How long do you suppose Mr. Craigen-.&#xD;
fels 'd sit beaming so kindly, if I did? Look at her, pulling&#xD;
them flowers into smithereens, and fixin' up her lips as mourn-&#xD;
ful as irges !"&#xD;
" wouldn't interfere, if I were you," replied the doctor,&#xD;
with a queer smile. "Wait a little. There is not an error but&#xD;
sheathes its retribution. Come directly, without making a&#xD;
fuss."&#xD;
t"Very well, sir ; since you say I ought, I will,",she replied,&#xD;
readily, and she sat down by Chris, and ate her breakfast with&#xD;
as healthy appetite as though Belle's words had been a kindly&#xD;
morning salutation. That young person's strategy had proved&#xD;
a signal failure, and she had not got rid of Sonsie at a blow, as&#xD;
she intended; and she lifted swimming eyes to her host's face,&#xD;
in beautiful, bewildered terror.&#xD;
"Now it is evident that I have made a sad blunder. I&#xD;
meant to pay a compliment, a merited one, too. Believe me,&#xD;
Ididnotknow;* I had no idea. Shall I go down onnmy knees&#xD;
to everybody, Sonsie Eagan included?  Do forgive me, every-.&#xD;
body. I have to-have smiles and petting, to be comfortable.&#xD;
Oh dear!"&#xD;
" Give me some coffee, mea Tortolita preciosa," said --ncle&#xD;
Alec, cheerfully, " and let us get on with our breakfast. T--here's&#xD;
no harm done, and what shall be the order of our day?"&#xD;
But all his kindly efforts could not bring gaiety to the surface&#xD;
again, and the breakfast passed very nearly in silence. .When&#xD;

it was finished, Sonsie went, with her head up, .to Deb, and got&#xD;
a basket of corn, and walked briskly down to the poultry-yard,&#xD;
intending to get rid of her stormy thoughts among the chickens.&#xD;
She had a couple of the yellow balls in her lap, and was begin.&#xD;
ning to look merry, and feel good-humored, when Belle Bran.&#xD;
don called her by name.&#xD;
"I've taken some trouble to come down to you, my good&#xD;
girl, and Jsome in kindness, because I cannot bear to see you&#xD;
put yourlfin a way tobe snubbed. You are too bright and&#xD;
sensible, and I hate to have you get your feelings trodden upon,&#xD;
as you did this morning. These gentlefolks will toss you away,&#xD;
when they get weary of you, as they would an old shoe. I&#xD;
would keep to my'stationy if I were you. You see, , innocent&#xD;
as I am, was led by your false position into a perfectly natural&#xD;
speech, which proved disagreeable, all becauseyou was out of&#xD;
place."&#xD;
"Niver trouble yourself about me at all, Miss Brandon-"&#xD;
said Songie putting back her chickens carefully, and standing&#xD;
up to: toss out her-corn among the fowls,, who gathered around&#xD;
her " I an quite able to have care of meself, and take me,&#xD;
own part. I like being lectured by some, but I've got to feel&#xD;
a deep respect for people tohave advice from them, and I'm&#xD;
afraid the likes of :you sculdn'tdo me any good. There's Miss&#xD;
Chris, now  or Mrs. Vedder, or Mr. Jan (Sonsie's eyes twinkled),&#xD;
or Miss Iiradshaw--sured Ioutl it at their feet days and days,&#xD;
and drink up all their words, as you cock gobbles his corn, but&#xD;
you ! -ah, ya, wisha !"&#xD;
The gesture and accent of supreme disgust with which Sonsie&#xD;
finished her sentence irritated Belle beyond degree.&#xD;
"You have no 'business here! I'll see if you cannot be made&#xD;
to understand it! and I'll have you sent back toyour, work.&#xD;
Set beggars.on horseback ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Sure ye niver spake a truer word than that same, as ye&#xD;
yersel give exaniple," answered Sonsie, showing her teeth pro-&#xD;
vokingly, and smiling out of half-shut eyes. "Can't ye see I'm&#xD;
quite busy at me task now, sure, feeding Deborah's chickens ?&#xD;
You best stand aside, or you'll happen get a spatter pr so on&#xD;
yer bonnie gown, or the toe of yer slipper, along of that old hin&#xD;
scratchin'."&#xD;
"Your impudence shall not save you. I should supposeyou'd&#xD;
be too proud to stay where you're not wanted -where I do&#xD;
not want you," said Belle, haughtily.&#xD;
"And is it you that say them words to me, Belle Brandon.!&#xD;
you, to me !" said Sonsie, setting down her basket, and dusting&#xD;
her hands as shetook a step. toward-the blonde ; "I niver in&#xD;
the world meddled wid what concerns me not, but if ye put yer&#xD;
handsome body in me way, I'll walk over you, as. sure as me&#xD;
name's O'Rouke ! and where'd ye be hiding yer wicked blue&#xD;
eyes, and all them long curls, do ye think, if I was to tell Mr.&#xD;
Craigenfels the half of what I know 'of your doings. He's a&#xD;
true gentleman, and he would despise such tricks and lies as&#xD;
yours. I'd kape a civil tongue in my head, if I was you, and&#xD;
be aisy."&#xD;
Belle's eyes glittered, and she turned on her heel. " Perhaps&#xD;
I had better go and ask Mr. Craigenfels to send and fetch up&#xD;
your brother the boot-black, and your sister the swill-girl, and&#xD;
we might make room for your mother the scavenger,'- still,&#xD;
one must draw the line somewhere."&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
PIGEON DISPORTS HIMSELF AT WATCH. HILL.&#xD;
OHN NICKSON was absent on banking business; so&#xD;
the deacon said, and he honestly believed it. If bank-&#xD;
ing consists in throwing dice, from twelve o'clock at&#xD;
night till six in the morning, in gambling saloons, going to thea.&#xD;
tres, dance-houses, races, and the like, he was banking to a&#xD;
tremendous extent, with aid from his crony, Knox.&#xD;
Mrs. Nckson was ill. Dr. Jenkins feared she was going into&#xD;
a decline, --and said she must have change of air ; he would&#xD;
have prescribed a course of Sonsie Eagan, only that bright-&#xD;
eyed lassie was not to be had for calling, being absent at this&#xD;
time with the' party in New York, as Zoe's maid. Poor Mary&#xD;
Ann was nervous, started with every sound ; a sudden footstep&#xD;
in the hall or a ring at the door-bell would take her breath&#xD;
away.  She was hot and cold, restless, and much given to&#xD;
tears. The family doctor,-who attended her closely, said Watch'&#xD;
Hill was the place, and Sonsie the companion. As she was&#xD;
not to be had, Mrs..Nickson declared she would gladly go, if he&#xD;
would persuade Ruth Blair to come along, and she was quite&#xD;
eager to be off, thinking how much good she could do the&#xD;
small matron, whose pale, still face was a .constant reproach&#xD;
to her.&#xD;
Ruth did not know how to entertain the idea of abandoning&#xD;
the Horseshoe. George might come ! This, though an ever-&#xD;
present possibility to her mind, would have sounded so idle to&#xD;
others, that she never spoke the hope, but gave her school as a&#xD;
hindrance to the trip. Dr. Jenkins set before her the duties&#xD;
devolving upon her : first, to the poor, weak sufferer, Mary&#xD;
&#xD;
Ann; next to her. boy., Such a pleasure to him; what sea-&#xD;
shells he could gather ; what pebbles; and, lastly, to herself.&#xD;
He made her look 'at her face in the mirror, and bade her&#xD;
accept this golden opportunity to persuade back her roses and&#xD;
establish her health more firmly. " Let him see what a pretty&#xD;
mother he has got, and it will not be many years, rugdar&#xD;
Ruth, before your boy will begin to compare your fa.ii~th&#xD;
other faces. Don't let it fade through any wilfulness datg.&#xD;
lect."&#xD;
Ruth consented, and while she gazed at herself, she won-&#xD;
dered if George would find her changed when he came home.&#xD;
So she turned her back on the Horseshoe, leaving her heart&#xD;
behind her, and in March she and Mary Ann were domiciliated&#xD;
in the spot where the winds work their free will, and the waves&#xD;
dash forever and forever on the sounding shore.&#xD;
The three were sole occupants of the Plimpton House, so&#xD;
gay in summer with lively guests and sea-side frolics. The&#xD;
early spring and cheerful sunshine invited them abroad, and&#xD;
Mrs. Nickson somewhat enjoyed sitting in sheltered places&#xD;
and listening to the dashing billows, watching the white gulls,&#xD;
and seeing Pigeon jump about, shouting his delight with the&#xD;
foam-caps, and Ruth gathering shells and mosses.  But' the&#xD;
poor, weak girl had few smiles. " She was sad at heart, and&#xD;
hadn't a word to say."&#xD;

HL.,,eleven o'clock- train was in, and George Blair&#xD;
stepped out upon the. platform of : the Millville depot,&#xD;
 his hag "strappedl across his back, a box in his hand,&#xD;
and set off at a good pace, treading squarely and firm, head&#xD;
up, chest :out, into the starlit night.: He had studied the faces of&#xD;
the new passengers who :got -in at Toptown,. and listened to&#xD;
their talk, hoping to.:learn something of Ruthie ; but they were&#xD;
all strangers, and prated of irrelevant matters. He crossed&#xD;
Peddler's bridge, and remembered his walk with Belle Brandon,&#xD;
in her pilgrim hat and staff; and thenthis, thoughts flew by quick&#xD;
transitionto. Ruthie, as he had found her . that night on .his&#xD;
return, fast asleep,. with wet lashes and crimson cheeks, and&#xD;
he involuntarily tightened: his clasp of the box he carried, and&#xD;
quickened his pace.&#xD;
The Horseshoe was all dark ; not a glimmer ; but then other&#xD;
houses were dark also;. that ,was- to be expected at this late&#xD;
hour. He. trod..softly: upon the porch, and knocked at the&#xD;
door, and tried the. latch. 3 It was fast, of course. Ruthie was&#xD;
a careful little housekeeper. He had gone through that door&#xD;
with her on his arm not three years ago, a joyous, blooming&#xD;
bride, and welcomed her to his home. No sound. He lis-&#xD;
tened, and went on tiptoe to her window among the lilacs and&#xD;
roses. He trod down the cr cus and tulips she loved, and&#xD;
tapped upon the glass, and called her name. No answer. He&#xD;
began to be chilly and pale. What could it mean ?  A great&#xD;
shaggy dog sprang out upon him, growling- and threatening.&#xD;
"Ah, Flirt, good dog! where is she ?"  Flirt lay down at his&#xD;

He might be one of those men. Why not?   H    served it.&#xD;
Flirt was very uneasy, and wished to entice, o enter the&#xD;
deserted house. He took out his jack-knife, a;ruicklcat&#xD;
away the string from the sash.  He- knew prec elyhere  to&#xD;
work, because it was one of his own -setting, and in afew&#xD;
moments he stood within the room, which was still as death.&#xD;
He took a match from his pocket, and lighted the gas. The&#xD;
white bed was perfect ; the work-table, the crimson basket, thi&#xD;
toilette, the bracket -2..herhad helped to arrange them all- --most&#xD;
of them were the work of his fingers -every thing looked in&#xD;
dainty order. He listened for the solid tick of the great lock&#xD;
in the other room, but itwasistifl and he opened the deoi__d&#xD;
stepped in. His desk!was open. It seemed as the ha d sit&#xD;
an hour ago. The tiny cogs and wheels, his. booksa,.arie&#xD;
some half-finished toys, lay scattered upon the black velvet;&#xD;
and a letter,! He -left a etter there, in that very spot, when&#xD;
he deserted his true, good wife. :Was this, the same ? He lifted&#xD;
it, and read his own name, "George Blair," in tiny characters&#xD;
-Ruth's writing -4he kissed themn d tore it_ open.&#xD;

week before, and he told her she should see her again. Oh&#xD;
yes, very soon. Before he slept he looked over the box of toys,&#xD;
which were marked Pigeon, the silver engine made from a&#xD;
Mexican d    dusted and. set out the work-box of Campeachy&#xD;
wood, witli unfinished R, and touched and examined all&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
EXPLAINS WHY MRS. BLAIR DID NOT GET HER BATH.&#xD;
HE made up her mind to have an ocean bath. Mr.&#xD;
rlimpton said the water was cold as ice, and she&#xD;
would catch her death.&#xD;
Ruth pooh-poohed that statement. "Ducks don't find their&#xD;
death in the yeasty brine,"'said she ; and when the gentleman&#xD;
stared, she smiled. He did not know who was used to call her&#xD;
" duck."&#xD;
Mary Ann shivered at the thought of such a plunge ; so Ruth&#xD;
apped her in a warm shawl, and put her in a cleft of the&#xD;
rock, where the sun beat down, and left her with Pigeon to&#xD;
amuse her.&#xD;
Ruthie had donned her crimson bathing-dress, of warm cloth,&#xD;
and her. patient said she looked like little Red Ridinghood&#xD;
going to see her grandmother, and hoped she. wouldn't meet&#xD;
any wicked wolf. ' You're proper pretty, Ruth,". she added, as&#xD;
she hung the little basket on her friend's arm,  proper pretty&#xD;
isn't she, Pigeon?"&#xD;
&#xD;
1'&#xD;
&#xD;
WHY MRS. BLAIR DID NOT GE T HER BATH 359&#xD;
Pigeon declined giving an opinion, but-promulgated a state-&#xD;
nent concerning "precious papa," which got him an unlimited&#xD;
number of kisses. The small matron's crimson shawl was&#xD;
knotted about her, and she was busily stooping among the&#xD;
rocks, hunting her algae, and added some lovely scarlet speci-&#xD;
mens to her collection. She felt particularly gay. Whether it&#xD;
was the bracing air, or her absence from familiar scenes, which&#xD;
were all written over with her sorrow, I cannot tell; but she&#xD;
was sure George would come home. She was thinking about&#xD;
him as she walked up and down. That was nothing unusual;&#xD;
for her handsome giant was always the sub-thought in her mind,&#xD;
no matter what troubled its -surface. She found her shawl&#xD;
heavy, the sun was so hot, and she threw it off, and sat down&#xD;
on the warm sands, and took off her stockings and shoes, pre.&#xD;
paratory to her plunge, and while she tempted the waves with&#xD;
her little foot, round and' smooth, and the color of a pink sea-&#xD;
shell, she pondered what she would get for supper, what she&#xD;
would wear on, the gala night when George. had come.,. She&#xD;
rose, and looked enjoyingly around her at the sky and th sea,&#xD;
and all the while she trolled snatches of her cradle song,....&#xD;
"The cricket sings under the hearth-&#xD;
The bird is asleep on the-tree ;"&#xD;
and then she fell to indenting small impressions of her foot&#xD;
in the yielding sand, and once she fancied she caught her sim.&#xD;
ple refrain echoed back in her husband's voice, and she smiled&#xD;
to think how her intense longing could almost cheat her ears.&#xD;
A saucy billow flirted up and kissed her toes, and she sprang&#xD;
back in haste, it was so cold. "Ugh ! tis -chilly 1" said she;&#xD;
"but a duck who has jumped into freezing water all winter need&#xD;
not be frightened at it, I'll have my bath, anyhow. Now then !"&#xD;
'--she swung her arms, as children do, who propose to- leap'&#xD;

front the big beam on to the hay mow, -- "one to begin, two&#xD;
to show, three to make ready,'four to go !"&#xD;
But Ruth did not "go; 'a...ir:.f eat strong,. ijgarms&#xD;
caulit herand held her fast and the"arin bud of a&#xD;
woman" just fluttered to her biisband's faithful heart with one&#xD;
sob ofj j nd wa4, 'ahp me.&#xD;
The glad sea waves came rolling in, hurrying, and leaping&#xD;
each other's shoulders, to get a sight of her in her crimson gar-&#xD;
ments, and the wind-voices piped tunefully above them, and&#xD;
he white gulls wheeled and screamed and flew out over the&#xD;
green water, to carry the news to their friends, who were riding&#xD;
the froth-caps, and the human souls drank in the bliss which is&#xD;
oought by absence.&#xD;
Ruth was the first to speak. What she said was nothing&#xD;
originall or thrilling, but her husband liked it.' It would have&#xD;
tone you good to get a look at his face while he gazed at her&#xD;
uplifted one.&#xD;
"Oh, George ! how lucky that you came that very instant!&#xD;
I was just going to plunge, and I should have been as wet as&#xD;
a mermaid, and then I couldn't have got this good old-fash-&#xD;
ioned hug, could I? George, George ! are you sure it is you?&#xD;
really and truly ? no dream-?  I have had so many such, where&#xD;
I saw your eyes looking jpst as they do now, and then I have&#xD;
wakened to find myself alone - that was too pitiful !"&#xD;
Ruth's eyes began to fill, and George made haste to reassure&#xD;
her.     .&#xD;
"jThis is no dream, duck," giving her a fresh hug, "nor&#xD;
this;' you couldint dream such kisses as these, could you ? "&#xD;
They were both silent a while, scarcely thinking, only con-&#xD;
sc s of happiness; then George said, NDefore God, who&#xD;
sees us, duck, I meant to do rgt. I *as' aiwajs a clumsy&#xD;

fellow, and I blundered horribly ; but I didn't know what a&#xD;
fool I was till a few weeks ago - a stupid, blind fool."&#xD;
As George went on talking, Ruth's thoughts flew over the&#xD;
past. She saw that he had no idea she had ever coupled Belle&#xD;
Brandon with him in jealous folly, and she considered, with the&#xD;
lightning quickness women are capable of, whether she should&#xD;
tell him, and she decided -little Jesuit that she was -" No,&#xD;
I will not so humble myself, nor shame him.' It is my own se-&#xD;
cret, and I will bury it out of sight. I have suffered enough."&#xD;
Was she right ? The giant's story was told, she knew all&#xD;
about his day in the Romanza and Otho's deliverance, and she&#xD;
tightened her clasp of his hand as the scene rose vividly be-&#xD;
fore her. George struggling with death! and she thanked the&#xD;
merciful Christ, who had restored him to her love.&#xD;
" Have you forgiven me ?" said she. "Am I honest and&#xD;
true and loyal? No spot, no flaw ? Are you sure ,that I&#xD;
never in my life loved any man but you?"&#xD;
" Duck, don't make me blush -a great fellow like me !&#xD;
Come, let's begin anew. Only, if ever Belle Brandon comes&#xD;
in my way!" &#xD;
"Well, George !" said Ruth, fluttering a little, "what&#xD;
would you do?"&#xD;
"I'd -I'd "-the giant clenched his fists -then loosing&#xD;
them with a bright smile, he finished, "I'd think what a fool&#xD;
she made of me!"&#xD;
Ruth hid her face. " Even so," she thought; "and, Ibo&#xD;
will have to think what a fool she made of me." She took&#xD;
from her bosom a worn paper, and kissed it, tore it into frag-&#xD;
ments, and scattered them upon the waves at their feet.&#xD;
"That was your last letter to me, George," said she. "I&#xD;
did not like the tone of it, and so you see I have confided it to&#xD;

letters -will you?".&#xD;
" Never, dearest-! I'll never write you another, if Heaven is&#xD;
kind to me, for I mean always to keep you close to me."&#xD;
A sweet childish voice rung out clear on the rocks above&#xD;
them, "Manma, mamma I"&#xD;
# Ah ! my darling Pigeon," said George, and the two made&#xD;
haste to seek him&#xD;
"Look,= baby, look ! " - exclaimed Ruth'; "look who is&#xD;
coming !"&#xD;
" Precious papa !" said the boy, reaching out his hands.&#xD;
"Ah! you did not forget me."&#xD;
Mary Ann saw them climbing up, the child mounted on his&#xD;
old favorite perch, and throwing kisses from the giant's shoul-&#xD;
der. She clasped her thin hands, and burst into tears. "Oh,&#xD;
my God! I thank thee that I have lived to see this good&#xD;
sight ! Now I feel that my sin is forgiven."-&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
CHRIS HAS A .CHANCE OF BECOMING A SPINNER.&#xD;
S may be supposed, our Chris passed a sleepless nght&#xD;
in the 'Tower-room at Craigenfels after her mother's&#xD;
cordial welcome hone, andsshe made up her mind to&#xD;
do heriduty. So she slipped out of a side door as soon as she&#xD;
could go ' unbserved, and found Thobias Lysy  anong his&#xD;
peach   es&#xD;
"Deaar Thomas, may Lride Zephyr a little this morning?"&#xD;
" Certainly, Miss Chrissie; I'll have him groomed and sad-&#xD;
&#xD;
died directly."  She followed him ,down to, the loose bo .where&#xD;
the pretty creature was looking out for them. "Here you,&#xD;
Tommy!1 step lively, and bring out Zephyr for" this young&#xD;
lady."&#xD;
".Don't speak loud, Thomas,, please, cause I don't want&#xD;
them to know. I'll just pnount here, in ;the yard and have a&#xD;
quiet canter all by myself. The people up onder, won't miss&#xD;
me."&#xD;
She 'was turning out of the gate, when Otho Groenveldt&#xD;
came in behind the old grapery, and stood.ging after her, in&#xD;
displeased astonishment.t. Zephyr, pranced and arched his little&#xD;
head, and pointed his. fie ears, ani uttered short snorts;. re-&#xD;

rather. doubtfully,:.as he noticed the, young -doctor'sanxious&#xD;

for Rainbow. She hardly expected to find him, because she&#xD;
had gotten a full account of his tricks and his manners during&#xD;
her absence, from Sonsie, but still she felt a little more down-&#xD;
hearted thani before, because he did not appear. She stepped&#xD;
upoff the door-stone, where Otho had taken leave of her after&#xD;
her wonderful day up at Craigenfels, when he had asked -if he&#xD;
might come and see her. She turned the handle -it was fast&#xD;
- so she knocked; no one came ; she knocked again; the&#xD;
upper window lifted, and the grim widow stuck out, her head,,&#xD;
enwrapped in an old red handkerchief.&#xD;
" What d'ye want; poundin' down there ?" asked she.&#xD;
"To come in, mother, and see you," replied Chris, humbly.&#xD;
"What ! they got tired on ye so quick up there ?  ['thought&#xD;
'twouldn't last long ; such hifaluten talkin' never amounts to&#xD;
shucks. That old man, that's always running, like a fool's eyes,&#xD;
to the ends of the earth, he's wiser in his own conceit than&#xD;
seven men who can render a reason. - Proverbs xxvi. 6."&#xD;
"May I come in, mother ?"&#xD;
"Come in i Do you. suppose I'm going to leave my work,&#xD;
and keep prancing up and down stairs all the while, to wait&#xD;
on you, just when you take a notion? If you do, your drefful&#xD;

"Oh, mother! please don't -talk so to me. Let me come&#xD;
in." Chris burst inio tears.&#xD;
"You are a wicked, rebellious, wasteful childI As vinegar&#xD;

hardly knew where she was, and let Zephyr gallop as&#xD;
swiftly:as herchose. She hadn't expected much de-&#xD;
monstratib'dof affection, and yet the scene slie had just finished&#xD;
was hard to bear. She bitterly reproached herself for her&#xD;
hasty, undutiful words;, and wished she had bitten her tongue&#xD;
and kept it still, and when Zephyr dropped into a-walk, she&#xD;
thought deeply.. Was it her duty to take up her old life- again?&#xD;
"N !" she said firmly,. "it is not. I have a right to.-some-&#xD;
thing better, 'and-I am resolved to have it. I will finish at&#xD;
Rosenbloom. .  can' manage  it somehow, and I will. One&#xD;
year is mie already."..,&#xD;
. 2Zephyr heard aclatter of hoofs behind him, and picked up&#xD;
his little round sabots in a hurry. He had no idea of being&#xD;
passed by horse-feet, and. he fleetly flew, like a winged wind.&#xD;

" Oh," said she, "he must have turned the corner, or taken&#xD;
that wood-path. Well, Zephyr, you have a clear road now,&#xD;
Let us go where you carried me that day."&#xD;
So they went over Hog's-back, through the. meadow-road,&#xD;
where Dulcet struggled with the cow-ponys, up the glen, paus.&#xD;
ing at the well-remembered places. She dismounted, twice&#xD;
or thrice, to gather pale blossoms, when the gentle steed fol-&#xD;
lowed her like a dog, coaxing for a taste of her wood-flowers.&#xD;
While she stood playing with him, pushing off the inquisitive&#xD;
nose he was determined to thrust among her sweets, she heard&#xD;
a scramble and a loved "purmow," and Rainbow came tearing&#xD;
through the bushes, and leaped upon her, overwhelmed with&#xD;
joy. She sat down on the grass and gathered him in her arms,&#xD;
and had a good cry, and she felt better.&#xD;
" Now I'll give you-a little ride, my dear cat," said she, invit-&#xD;
ing him to a place upon her horse, which he readily took, and&#xD;
lay with his fore-paws dangling among Zephyr's beauty-locks,&#xD;
while he looked out complacently over his head.&#xD;
Chris laughed heartily, and the steed seemed to like it too,&#xD;
and stood quite still, or walked carefully, not to disturb his&#xD;
new friend. They rambled on through the sweet-smelling&#xD;
woods, just bursting into leaf, and when Chris was' tired and&#xD;
ready to mount she took Rainbow in her' arms, and poured&#xD;
out her sorrows to him, as she used in the old days, when he&#xD;
was the treasure-house of her secrets, and she.got a little com-&#xD;
fort out of his purring society. They neared the gate; and she&#xD;
turned her head, and looked and listened.&#xD;
"I think it must 'be the headless horseman, who used to&#xD;
vanish when people sought him," said she, "for I feel certain I&#xD;
heard hoofs behind us. Say, Zdphyr, do you remember how&#xD;

plain as horse could, and Chris pulled the Egyptian close up&#xD;
to her, tightened the reins, and brightly, softly, airily, easily,&#xD;
over they flew, and landed in safety. The maid forgot her sor-&#xD;
row, and her eyes danced, and the gray rocks threw back her&#xD;
joyous laughter. She heard a shout, and swift hoofs behind&#xD;
her, and turned her head just in time to see Otho Groenveldt&#xD;
following her lead, and in another moment he reined in Black&#xD;
Tramp at her side.&#xD;
"So it was you, sir, who have been dodging in and out. be-&#xD;
hind me, putting Zephyr into a foam, till I shall get scolded by&#xD;
Thomas for hard riding," said Chris, frowning.&#xD;
The young doctor looked much amused at the unexpected&#xD;
salutation.&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Chris. It is I. When a young lady is fool-&#xD;
hardy enough to start off alone on a gay horse, who has not&#xD;
been out of his stall for a week, I think she needs somebody to&#xD;
look after her. You are certainly fortunate to come home with&#xD;
your head where it belongs."&#xD;
Chris laughed scornfully.&#xD;
"I should get a sconce for my head, and ensconce it too, or&#xD;
else seek my wit in my shoulders, when I come to grief through&#xD;
Zephyr's treachery. I am a firm believer in the chivalry of&#xD;
horses. Good-by, Rainbow. Thank Zephyr for your ride,"&#xD;
she added as the Egyptian leaped to the ground and trotted on&#xD;
before them.&#xD;
"That is a wonderful cat of yours, Miss Chris," remarked&#xD;
Otho, looking interested.&#xD;
"Yes, sir; I intend to change his name from Rainbow to&#xD;
everlasting steadfastness, because he is always the same  a&#xD;
firm, true friend."&#xD;
"What if I were to remind you of an old contract of ours,&#xD;

some: fine day, pick up our merry contest, and take the ride,&#xD;
and 'a leap also, if you like ? I see you have not lost your&#xD;

ks upon hid glossy faceind a farewell pat, she walked straight&#xD;
up .to the house. She found Uncle Alec in the library, and&#xD;
she laid her'hand upon his houlder.a&#xD;
I've got no friend but you now; no home but this. 'I'm a&#xD;

with her hands full of cut-flowers, and did her best oor-wak&#xD;
lightly, 'spea&#xD;
"I'll takecare of' all such necessities, my child ; give your-&#xD;

"I fear I may be de trop. Shall I. withdraw," asked 'Belle,&#xD;
sniing.&#xD;
"Not at all,. my dear," 'replied the old fellow, beaming on&#xD;
her; "come in, pray, pretty Flora, _iTortolita preciosa."&#xD;
Chris, preoccupied as she was, observed the tenderness into&#xD;
which the soft Spanish melted in his tones, and also noted that&#xD;
his eyes followed the beauty's graceful motions with peculiar&#xD;
pleasure.    .&#xD;
"Do you like blue and scarlet, Mr. Craigenfels ?" asked&#xD;
Belle, wing close up to her host. Her rapid step showed&#xD;
her tiny blue satin slipper, and her floating soft hair, dressed&#xD;
with fuschias; drifted back from her creamy face, and pendant&#xD;
from his turquoise brooch there hung a cluster of the eardrops,&#xD;
and her azure crape tiailed after her in sweeping folds.&#xD;
"I had infinite trouble to coax your gardener, but I made&#xD;
him kind at last, and he gave me these for you and Mr. Groen-&#xD;
veldt.  You see, I am not the selfish girl who forgets her&#xD;
friends-rosemary, and rue, and pansies. You may divide&#xD;
them between you. Ah, here comes your cavaher. I saw you&#xD;
riding in together. There L don't blush. Mr. Craigenfels, we&#xD;
must be sharp with these young people. .We do not approve&#xD;
of their stealing off through by-ways slyly, do we? You must&#xD;
also wear the willow, Mr. Groenveldt, I fear, along with your&#xD;
rue." She took up' Chris's wrist, and flashed the sapphires be-&#xD;

&#xD;
Belle laughed merrily. "Max is such a pretty name," ex.&#xD;
claimed she..           .&#xD;
Otho bowed pleasantly to the blonde.   "Young ladies,&#xD;
thoughts are much given to matrimony, I suppose ; so it is not&#xD;
strange that Miss Brandon should prate of it so parlous sweet,-&#xD;
and, apropos, I have a letter from your adored, which I took&#xD;
from the post but now, H. X. Z. Zambrano has a choice mono.&#xD;
gram, indeed."&#xD;
Belle reddened, and reached out quickly to take the epistle,&#xD;
which Uncle Alec could not help seeing.&#xD;
"It appears that my friend Dolores likes it, since she is-so&#xD;
fond of using it. This is one of her crossed and recrossed&#xD;
epistles, all about the balls and concerts and beaux, I suppose.&#xD;
As for me, I am s' thoroughly happy here, that I have forgot.&#xD;
ten my town-life. I wish everybody would leave me alone."&#xD;
" Her penmanship is something masculine, is it not," asked&#xD;
Otho, incredulously.&#xD;
"I am not aware that it is of the least consequence to you,&#xD;
Mr. Groenveldt," replied Belle, a little crossly.. " However I&#xD;
assure you she writes in the precise style taught at Rosen..&#xD;
bloom."&#xD;
"That is not Dolores' writing," remarked Chris, quietly.&#xD;
"It-is," said Belle..&#xD;
= it is nto," answered Chris, walking off into the drawing.&#xD;
room, where Otho followed her.S&#xD;
" Politeness is a quality which highly adorns a woman.  VMous&#xD;
Pte tres polie, cherie," said Belle, airily, as she thrust the missive&#xD;
into her pocket..&#xD;
"'But how about that handsome young Cuban, rhea preciosa,"&#xD;
asked Uncle Alec, kindly; "Is he to be the happy individual ?"&#xD;
"That boy /" exclaimed Belle.. "Oh no, sir!1 Please don't&#xD;
you jest with me ? ' I cannot bear it; I don't .mind Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Groenveldt and our Chris, because they know I could never&#xD;
fancy such an unformed, immature person."&#xD;
" Why not, my dear ?  He is a mighty good-looking chap."&#xD;
Belle picked out her flowers, and laid them up together, the&#xD;
scarlet and the blue, with her head on one side admiringly. Of&#xD;
course she did not know that her host was watching her.&#xD;
"Perhaps- he may, but you see I don't like him ; that's all.&#xD;
When I marry, I mean to have a husband who has dignity and&#xD;
responsibility and position."&#xD;
" Better be careful how you correspond much with him, then.&#xD;
Those hot-headed Spaniards are hard toy manage; and pretty&#xD;
soon he'll be writing love to you, and it were a pity you should&#xD;
break his heart."&#xD;
"Me, sir!1 I break no hearts ; I correspond with no lovers.&#xD;
You don't know me yet ; and as for love, I had not found out&#xD;
what it meant till I came "-she blushed, and dropped her eyes&#xD;
upon the toe of her slipper, and then lifted them slowly till they&#xD;
reached his, when they were swimming in modest confusion.&#xD;
"Do let me sing to you," said she, tossing away her flowers&#xD;
in a pretty hurry, after a pause, during which she had been pun-&#xD;
ishing the poor blossoms dreadfully - tearing them, as Sonsie&#xD;
would have said, into smithereens=-and manceuvring her lips&#xD;
and her dimples.. Her voice was at its richest, and she was&#xD;
gushing, ardent, coaxing, childish, -delightful. She and her host-&#xD;
were tote4-ete till dinner, and the genial gentleman passed a&#xD;
most agreeable morning. Belle Brandon had a little worry to&#xD;
keep under too, so that when she got to her room to dress, and&#xD;
pulled out and read her crumpled letter, she threw herself&#xD;
wearily down upon her bed, with drooping arms.&#xD;
"Oh dear," said she, 14 I only hope lejeu en vaut la chan-&#xD;

drew from her pocket a handful of Mexican dollars, probably&#xD;
as confirmation of'her statement.  "An old man's darling bet&#xD;

She sat down before 'her mirror, and studied her blue orbs&#xD;
and creamy face for inspiration, and then she indited a tender&#xD;
epistle, full of pet names and endearments, which she signed&#xD;
"Your. own loving Belle," and directed -to  Henriquez Zam-&#xD;

Otho followed Chris into a little morning-room, which was&#xD;
mostly bow-window, and sat down by her.&#xD;
"Miss Chris, I am glad you came into this odd, out-of-the-&#xD;

such praises of George Blair,in such terms that Chris was as-&#xD;

"Ah, my good girl, I perceive you are about to take my ad.&#xD;
vice. That is right. Get a suitable, respectable service, and&#xD;
you may come to me any time for reference."&#xD;
"J'll come to ye for other than that one day, I'm thinkin',"&#xD;
said Sonsie.&#xD;
She was walking briskly through the upper glen, with her&#xD;
head up, which .she tossed a little sometimes, as if she were&#xD;
getting the better of an adversary in her busy thoughts, when&#xD;
Zephyr came close upon her before she saw him, or heard his&#xD;
light hoofs on the springing turf.&#xD;
"Why, Miss Chris, dear [this was the same morning. on&#xD;
which Chris paid her visit of filial duty to Brookside, you know,&#xD;
and she was returning from the same], why, Miss Chris, don't&#xD;
ye ride over a poor walkin' body, vid yer pretty horse. Sure&#xD;
ye look winsome, the pair of ye, and this is .a bonnie green&#xD;
place for our meeting."-&#xD;
Chris drew rein, and the two young faces, both clouded&#xD;
before with unwelcome thoughts, cleared, and rippled all over&#xD;
with smiles.&#xD;
"I saw ye, mavourneen, though ye stole off so sly, and right&#xD;
glad am I that ye got yer dainty Zephyr so brave and early;&#xD;
for there's a Kilpie after him. -But whisper, darlin' ladykin,&#xD;
where's the cheerness that should light yer precious face&#xD;
Chris was just in the humor for unlocking her trouble, and&#xD;
she let it all out to the faithful soul, so good to rest upon.&#xD;
"And what am I to do, Sonsie?" she finished; "no clothes,&#xD;
and no money ! Was ever a poor girl so tried?"&#xD;
The Celtic lassie heard her in swelling wrath. " I'll go&#xD;
down and break open the place wid me two fists, and bring&#xD;
away yer things mesel' ! ivery rag ! Bad luck to the murtherin'&#xD;

Though Sonsie had all the -Irish reverence for parental&#xD;

angel's trouble, and was going on to intensify the occasion,&#xD;
when Chris stopped her.&#xD;
"No, no, Sonsie; hush ! I. must not let you talk so. I&#xD;
feel very unhappy, and I know my behavior was not'just per-&#xD;
fection. I am afraid I rather spoke up ;, and I'm going to&#xD;
think it over quietly, and make up my mind. It is a serious&#xD;
thing for a young girl to cut loose from the mother. Oh, dear,&#xD;
I wish mine loved me ! Good-by, Sonsie, my own Sonsie ;&#xD;
give my dear love to Ruthie and Pigeon."&#xD;
Sonsie watched her slender figure round the bend, and stood&#xD;
still a moment after she had gone out of sight, thinking, before&#xD;
she walked on.&#xD;
"Ah, wisha ! 'tis a wanderin' bird cast out of its nest that ye&#xD;
are, darlin'; ' thy lips are a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is&#xD;
comely.' She read them words to me this very mornin' herself,&#xD;
out of me new Bible, and mighty good readin' it is, for all Father&#xD;
O'Gorman forbidden' it to us. Sure and faith, I've the com-&#xD;
mon sense given me by our great Father in heaven, and I'll&#xD;
use it for guidance the best I'm able, before I give me soul up&#xD;
to be huded and hushed by ary priest at all. These Yankee&#xD;
girls are ladies and Christians, and their ministers tell them to&#xD;
search the Scriptures ; and just listen to them talk ! You&#xD;
can't puzzle them on the doctrines, and we poor Catholics&#xD;
haven't a word to say for our faith, through bein' kept in dark-&#xD;

Her head was bent, and her eyes seeking the ground, and&#xD;
her footsteps soslow that, when Jan Vedder espied 'her, he&#xD;
said to his mother:. "Sonsie has lost something."'&#xD;
He. was driving 'the, creams" up to Craigenfels inquest of&#xD;
this very lassie,: and he stopped to speak to her.&#xD;
"What istit,. Ollan Fo lda'?  Not the green glass breast-pin&#xD;

"Jup in, and I'll drive straight up to Craigenfels and hunt&#xD;

" No, Mr. Jan, thankin' ye "kindly; I feel quite sure that it&#xD;

Jan jumped down. " Sit'by me, Sonsie. I want you most,&#xD;

She hesitated.&#xD;
"Yes, dear da ghter; sit there;: that is right: We women&#xD;

"I will gladly come,. then,' Mrs. Vedder, and 'thank ye truly&#xD;

She proceeded to detail Chris's story, and to give a very&#xD;
forcible opinion of the sour widow and her doings; and Jan&#xD;
took it up, and said no such" proceedings as those would go&#xD;
down, and threw in stinging, comments upon her excessive&#xD;
piety, and closed up by asserting that if such religion was going&#xD;
to take such people to heaven, he had no wish to go there.&#xD;
"Christians are going to heaven," answered Sonsie, with&#xD;
the fixed assurance which her recent solution of the matter,&#xD;
gave her, " They'll take their love, their goodness, and thei&#xD;
truth, and their delicacy, and culture, along with them ; and&#xD;
that's why it will be so pleasant to be among them. I don't&#xD;
believe purple blood will count there. Those are the people&#xD;
I like to live with, and I am goingto try to go."&#xD;
While Jan was studying her, and hoping she wouldn't be in&#xD;
a hurry to get off, a peddler passed them, in a covered cart.&#xD;
" Just the fellow we need, Sonsie," he exclaimed, in an&#xD;
excited voice. He will do bravely. Hillo, Tim ! where are&#xD;

" I'll stop, Mr. Vedder, never fear ; that's just the sort of a&#xD;
cheese I like to cut," replied the peddler, laughing. " Come,&#xD;
git up, ye darned lazy cretter, or I'll swap ye off for soap&#xD;
grease. Git up !"&#xD;
Jan developed a plan as they drove on, which afforded intense&#xD;
amusement to Sonsie, who extolled highly his inventive genius,&#xD;
and caused his mother to say, smilingly, what a giddy pair of'&#xD;
young hopefuls they were, such a queer frolic; and to think&#xD;
&#xD;
SONSIE AND 7AN VISIT TIHE CHILDREN.          381&#xD;
how gay and handsome a couple they'd make. They had a&#xD;
delightful drive, and Sonsie got a lesson in managing the&#xD;
"creams," and Jan hugely enjoyed watching her blue eyes and&#xD;
purposeful face, as she obeyed his directions.&#xD;
"Let us go down to the Clayton mansion," said he, holding&#xD;
his head with both hands' during the fast time.  " Thank&#xD;
Heaven, my wig is all safe. Turn the next corner, Sonsie,&#xD;
take care! don't go round on two wheels, - and we'll look in&#xD;
on our family. That poor little cripple haunts me. I shall&#xD;
never forgot his look when he threw himself at my feet."&#xD;
"Nor the hard blow he got for it, either," said Sonsie.&#xD;
Captain Slocum was in the garden, in his shirt sleeves,&#xD;
directing his men, who were laying out flower-beds of every&#xD;
conceivable pattern, and he took off his straw hat and swung&#xD;
it round his head, as soon as he espied them.&#xD;
"Well, papa Slocum, how are the children?" asked Jan,&#xD;
reaching down to shake hands.&#xD;
"Seven golden candlesticks, seven rams, seven lambs, seven&#xD;
he-goats, seven bullocks," replied the captain. "You never&#xD;
saw such a group of young ones in your life. 'We are seven.&#xD;
We take our little porringers, and we eat our supper there,"&#xD;
pointing over his shoulder with his thumb toward the house.&#xD;
"Come up and see us do it. I thought, for a couple of days,&#xD;
that we shouldn't be but six, but my wife, she set that up&#xD;
square with a young woman she found after diligent search. I&#xD;
mentioned a nanny-goat, but Dulcet turned up her nose. She&#xD;
has peculiar ideas on these subjects."&#xD;
Mrs., Slocum sat in' the midst of her new family, busy and&#xD;
important as a hen. who has just brought .off a large brood.&#xD;
The oldest girl was in her lap, getting her flaxen hair curled ;&#xD;
and the pale cripplersat at her feet with a boek of colored pic-&#xD;
tures, which he wasisedately adrmiring, and his face lighted with&#xD;

a heavenly, smile when ht saw Sonsie; 'and he dropped the&#xD;
book and folded' his hands as if he was going to pray. She&#xD;
stooped, and kissed his passive, uncomplaining eyes, and in.&#xD;
quired how he liked his new home.,&#xD;
"It is, lowly-sweet here !":said he. ""She is so good !" He&#xD;
took Dulcet's stuff gown into ?.his clasp,;and pressed it to his&#xD;
heart. "I'm sohappy; 'and they eat and sleep; they've for.&#xD;
gotten all' about the dreadful times: 'I can't ; I dream of them&#xD;

and when I wake up in my good bed - all nice and warm--&#xD;
I'm so glad.! so glad!."                            .&#xD;
The other five were imbibing nourishment under the charge&#xD;
of a nice red-and-white- young woman,. who held the ibit of a&#xD;
baby to her breast.; and old: Mrs. Petibone, who, with a vast"&#xD;

"Really, Mr. Vedder, and you, Sonsie," said Dulcet,&#xD;
" mother is.quite right ; she always is. ..:We do not know how,&#xD;
appropriately, to thank you for finding us'this. blessed work to&#xD;

" That is the captain's peculiarly forcibleway of expressing&#xD;
himself," said 'Dulcet,.fearing they might think hermworthy hus'&#xD;

these youngsters don't know their names from a general&#xD;
training , and we've got to. fix up something spry for them. Now,&#xD;
that one over there by Dulcet, with the angel's head on- his&#xD;
crooked body, he says the old hag called him ' Crip ;' that is&#xD;
insulting and personal. I declare, Jan ! I've been a great mind&#xD;
to cry forty, times, to look at him and hear him talk. Of course&#xD;
he'll never be the value of a row of baby-pins to work; but,&#xD;
somehow,. I feel softer-hearted towards him than any one on&#xD;
'em."  The captain blew his nose and wiped his eyes. "I&#xD;
wouldn't have missed having' him on no account whatever!"&#xD;
Sonsie came up, all fervor and fire.&#xD;
"Mr. Vedder, they're beautiful, sir, indeed! I never saw&#xD;
such a pair of boys ! I'd be sure they were Irish, only I know&#xD;
no Irish mother could be so cruelto her little ones. Oh, Cap-&#xD;
tain Slocum ! what a blessing ye'll get with these, I'm sure !"&#xD;
"Yes," replied the captain, who was revolving the name&#xD;
question. "Seven golden candlesticks, seven rams- oh, shaw!&#xD;
what am I thinkin' on? Come down stairs, Sonsie, with us,&#xD;
and help find out some good names for them. Dulcet, she's&#xD;
provided handsomely for the girls, haw ! haw ! all they can stag-&#xD;
ger under. Just wait till you come to the christening ! We are&#xD;
going to have a bully one as soon as we get 'em fatted up&#xD;
enough to stand it; yes, sir. Now if ye be ready, ' what time&#xD;
ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,&#xD;
and dulcimer, and all kinds. of music,' you'll see our seven&#xD;
golden candlesticks, seven rams," - the captain hesitated an in-&#xD;
stant, with a hopeless look, while he swallowed down something&#xD;
which seemed to stick in his throat, and then he pushed reso-&#xD;
lutely on, with his fist clenched, which he wagged up and down&#xD;
at every fresh "seven" like an industrious pump-handle,-&#xD;
"'seven lambs, seven he-goats, seven bullocks 1' There, Ved-&#xD;
der, I feel better ! I've been stifiin' them cretturs and keeping&#xD;

them under all the while ; now I've had it out wid'em, and my&#xD;
Mind's relieved. I feel better. I never was so bothered, I&#xD;
vam! Just as-soon as I pitch up. that sharp seven, off I go !"&#xD;
The captain put on his nose-nippers, and took down his&#xD;
family Bible.&#xD;
"Now, I kinder hanker after Bible names. There ! here's the&#xD;
chapter. Zerubbabel the son of Shealtial, and Jethron, Jerahiah,&#xD;
Jeremiah, and Bethpeor, and Ashdoth Pisgah; and Bethjesh-&#xD;
imoth." Captain Slocum took off his glasses, and tapped the&#xD;
page with them.  "There, by Jemima! the long names in&#xD;
that chapter's thicker'n hairs on a cat. What do you think on&#xD;
'em?"&#xD;
"Rather wanting in sweetness, a little jaw-breaking, are they.&#xD;
not, captain?"&#xD;
" Well, I don't know but what mebbe they be," replied he,&#xD;
with a discouraged air; "we'll look furder."&#xD;
" I wish you would let me name them," said Sonsie.&#xD;
" There, come ! you shall! You found 'em, and you shall&#xD;
name 'em. That's fair, ain't it, Jan ? "&#xD;
" Better be careful, sir; you will have a lot of young Patricks&#xD;
about your place -not able to kill snakes - if you trust her."&#xD;
"And is that the fashion of gentlefolks' manners, to turn the&#xD;
tongue against the blessed land?" said Sonsie, with her- head&#xD;
up. "The true Irish boys are brave as lions and gentle as&#xD;
doves ; and I don't know a sweeter name i the whole world,&#xD;
sure, than 'Morris !' It just melts on the lips like the love-&#xD;
song of the wood'quest."&#xD;
Jan ughtit did on hers, at any rate; so he said,-&#xD;
"What is it, Sonsie ?  Say it again."&#xD;
Morris, sir. ArV ye are not able to gainsay me either, nor&#xD;
match it among all yer Dutch things, that tears the mouth to&#xD;
pieces entirely."&#xD;

"Very good! very, indeed!" remarked the captain, approv-&#xD;
ingly. "Go on, Sonsie."&#xD;
" Well, sir, then there's Terrence -only a true, kind boy&#xD;
should bear that - and'tis s re and certain, in the home that&#xD;
you and Miss Dulcet give, y n lad he will learn to carry him.&#xD;
self upright and strong."&#xD;
"Thanks, Miss Eagan ! What a girl she -is, ain't she, Jan ?&#xD;
Yes, indeed, 'upright and-strong;' that's capital ! Two of them&#xD;
named and clenched,--now for the third."&#xD;
"How could you fancy 'Jan,' for a change ?" asked Sonsie,&#xD;
her curling lashes touching her delicately pencilled brows, as&#xD;
she lifted her blue eyes archly to the young man at her side.&#xD;
"Ye couldn't choose the name of a truer gentleman."&#xD;
Done, my girl! bravely done!" sang out the captain, 'seiz.&#xD;
ing both her hands and shaking them.&#xD;
Jan's cheek flamed through the dusky sun-brown, and his&#xD;
pulse leaped, but only for one instant; he reflected that if there&#xD;
were hidden in Sonsie's breast the shy love he desired to have&#xD;
there, she could never name him so lightly.&#xD;
"Now, there's that angel of patience up there ; what shall we&#xD;
do about him?"&#xD;
"Let him choose for himself, sir. Perhaps he remembers&#xD;
his own that his mother gave him. I'll go fetch -him, till he tells&#xD;
us."&#xD;
She stepped lightly off, and soon returned, leading the hump--&#xD;
back boy by the hand. ";He says he thinks he was Clarence,&#xD;
before he got' his fall and this," touching his misshapen-shoul.&#xD;
ders softly; "he -seems to remember it, and hedreaiq Lfen.&#xD;
times of a pretty lady."&#xD;
"'Well, my boy," said the captain, very kindly, " will you&#xD;
choose that for your name, now."&#xD;
&#xD;
"THERE'S NO FOOL LIKE AT OLD FOOL.' 387&#xD;
&#xD;
"May I have what I like, sir ?" asked the cripple, clinging&#xD;
fast to Sonsie's hand, and looking sedately into her face.&#xD;
" Certainly, child, any thing you say."&#xD;
"Then let me be called by her name, sir, if you please" -he&#xD;
spoke in a low, plaintive voice, which had always a memory of&#xD;
suffering in it. " This loveliest, pretty one, that looked heaven&#xD;
into my eyes when I was dying ; let me have her name for&#xD;
mine. I'm going to be a good boy, sir, while I stay, and I'll&#xD;
be sure never to blacken it with a dirty spot."&#xD;
Sonsie gazed down at him an instant, her deepening violet&#xD;
eyes drinking up the pensive sweetness of the look he fixed&#xD;
upon her, and then she flamed crimson red, and trembled all&#xD;
over, and her tears gushed out like a summer shower, and she&#xD;
sank down on the floor, and took him close in her arms. "Oh,&#xD;
my dear Lord Christ ! how good, to let me live that day, and&#xD;
help in this blessed work," sobbed she.&#xD;
Captain Slocum and Jan walked away, and I could not&#xD;
swear that there were no tears in their eyes, as they left the&#xD;
'humpbacked cripple ..and the beautiful maiden -the two&#xD;
"Sonsie's" -'together.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
"THERE'S NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL."&#xD;
HE widow Goldsmith was "cleaning up." It was,Fri&#xD;
day. She always scrubbed and scoured on Friday. It&#xD;
was part of her religion, as much as the Great Tribula.&#xD;
tion or Fast Day, and she had just come upon Chris's Penny&#xD;
Magazines, and poundedthem together, and stood glowering at&#xD;
them, when she heard a knock at the door.&#xD;

" I believe I'll burn 'em up. I hate the sight on 'em," said&#xD;
she, through the blue slit she used for talking, as she stalked off&#xD;
to glare upon the intruder.&#xD;
It proved to be a peddler, - a great, tall fellow, whose striped&#xD;
trousers were tucked into his rusty boots ; who wore a long-&#xD;
tailed coat, high-crowned battered stove-pipe, a check neck-tie,&#xD;
twisted loosely around his neck, and a reddish beard, reaching&#xD;
his waist, reddishshaggy eyebrows, and a stiff, sandy crop stick-&#xD;
ing straight out, all around his head. He' was freckled like&#xD;
the spotted pard, and tanned the color of a well-done sheep-&#xD;
skin,&#xD;
" Want to buy any tin-ware, marm ?" (nasally) "I've come&#xD;
from Bosting, by the way of New Having, with a load of tin&#xD;
ovings, in my one-horse wagging."&#xD;
The widow was just about to slam the door in his face as&#xD;
the quickest and most emphatic mode of reply, when she&#xD;
pricked up her ears, catching at one of his offers.&#xD;
"S wap for.old close, old rags, old ingy-rubbers, old books !"&#xD;
She eyed askance they volumes which were dear' treasures to&#xD;
her only, daughter. She held a couple in her hand; and there&#xD;
were twelve of them all together, and the pious old lady smiled&#xD;
a grim, forbidding smile.&#xD;
" Old books, hey? - and what'll ye give for books - nice&#xD;
ones, full of pictures.? Peddlers are the biggest cheats agoin';&#xD;
I shan't throw away my libry, Ican tell yu ! -"&#xD;
"Why, Lord bless you, ma'am, I wouldn't take in a new-&#xD;
born baby, and I don't believe you would nurther, by your&#xD;
looks (from the told, I mean)," said he, to himself. "Bring&#xD;
along yer 'vollums, ma'am. ''I expect we can make a:Trade !&#xD;
I've got basins, pans, skimmers, collanders, any thing. Whoa,&#xD;
there, youi old she-devillyou " i&#xD;
The widow started back involuntarily. . The' peddler, though&#xD;
&#xD;
"THERE'S. NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL."       889&#xD;
addressing his horse, toward whom he was looking, had shouted&#xD;
his adjuration into her unwilling ears like the crack of doom.&#xD;
't You can holler loud enough, I should hope !" said she,&#xD;
staring indigiaantly at him, and feeling of her left auricle.&#xD;
" I hef to, marm,, my old mare is so. gall-darned ugly. She&#xD;
run away 'tother day and spilt out all my tinware on the'road,&#xD;
I shan't be able to sell any more skimmers on that rout for six&#xD;
months, on account of them the youngsters picked up and toted&#xD;
home to their ma's. They glutted the market. Stan' still, can't&#xD;
ye ! I'll tell ye what, marm; spoken you rig on your bunnet,&#xD;
and come deawn to the gate, where I can give her a yank once&#xD;
in a while ; and I cacalate we'll make a scrumptious trade.&#xD;
Bring along a sample-of your books, tu. I du luv ter fix up a&#xD;
bargain with a real smart woman. There's that pesky critter --&#xD;
Lord ! how she rattles my tinware ! I'll go along deawn and&#xD;
lick her till you come."&#xD;
He shambled off with a long lope, brandishing his whip, and&#xD;
addressing his mare by a string of pet names, of which "blunde-&#xD;
bore " and "stick-in-the-mud " were perhaps the sweetest.&#xD;
The widow tied up her head, took three or four of the&#xD;
dear old books (Fred's gift to his curly-haired darling), stalked&#xD;
stiffly off, and was soon engaged in bargaining and haggling.&#xD;
"Well ! " she exclaimed, at length, " I never see a fellar that&#xD;
could cough and hem so loud as you do! I sh'd think you'd&#xD;
rasp your throat all to bits, scrapin' on't so all the while."&#xD;
"I've got a drefful cold, mrm ! I slept in the field last night&#xD;
with the gate open, and it settled on my lungs, I'm afraid.&#xD;
AHEM!&#xD;
" Little nervous, ain't you ? well here's a stew pan to bile yer&#xD;
catnip and tansy in -thutty.ceants in trade."&#xD;
The old rose-bush close to the kitchen door rattled, nd Son-&#xD;
sie Eagan darted out. She glanced quickly down the avenue,&#xD;

390-   "THERA'S    O FOOL LIXE AN OLD FOOL."&#xD;
where the peddler's "ahems" roared off at intervals, and lifting&#xD;
the latch, she entered the house, and flew swiftly up the stairs,&#xD;
"Why! there's my 'white angel's ' trunk, sure enough! The&#xD;
lyin' old woman, to say she'd put it up garret!"&#xD;
She was passing Chris's door on her way upward, and she&#xD;
stopped, and entered the room; the rosy-gray dresses, the pale'&#xD;
poplins, white aprons, trim shoes, round hats, etc., which had&#xD;
filled the trunk, were spread out on the dismantled bed; and&#xD;
it was the work of .a few minutes for the ambidextrous maiden&#xD;
to fold and replace them, which she did even to a bit of ribbon&#xD;
and a stray hair-pin she found on the floor. She locked the&#xD;
trunk, pulled it toward the window, softly raised the sash, lifted&#xD;
the heavy thing by main strength, and then stood irresolutely&#xD;
balancing it half-in, half-out.&#xD;
"rFve heard that these sole-leather ones can be pitched out&#xD;
of a third-story window without hurting them, but if this should&#xD;
burst open ! I'm afraid to risk it. Ah ! there's a rope 1"&#xD;
Letting her burden easily down, she took from the wall,&#xD;
among cards, hetchels, and other kitchen gear (the widow felt&#xD;
a spiteful pleasure in using Chris's room as a store-place for&#xD;
cast-offs), a clothes-line, tied it to the trunk-handle, and then&#xD;
to the old bedstead, leaving a little slack to start on, and&#xD;
dropped it as carefully as she could down above the lilacs.&#xD;
The peddler's voice reached her, and his "ahem " was so threat.&#xD;
ening, that she let it slip through her hand.. Down it went with&#xD;
a run; the bedpost creaked and groaned, and the rope parted.&#xD;
Sonsie looked fearfully out. " And you can !" said she, tri-&#xD;
umphantly ; "there,'tis as safe as a lady-bug in a rose-bud."&#xD;
The young girl had just latched the kitchen door behind her,&#xD;
acid was standing on the broad step-stone, when the widow,&#xD;
her arms full of pans and basin, turned the corner and faced&#xD;
her.&#xD;
&#xD;
"THERE'S NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL."        S38I&#xD;
" What do you want ?" inquired she.&#xD;
"I came, ma'am, to see after Miss Chris's little trunk, and&#xD;
to bdg you to let me take it up to her," said Sonsie, humbly.&#xD;
"She didn't send me ; but I felt so sorry for the dear young lady,&#xD;
among all those fine-dressed gentlefolks up at the guard-house,&#xD;
I was sure you would kindly give me leave to get it for her."&#xD;
" Oh ! that's your arrant, is it? Well, you may tell the dear&#xD;
young lady" (mimicking Sonsie's manner), "that when she's&#xD;
come back and begged my pardon on her knees, and rolled up&#xD;
her sleeves, and put in and worked and airnt 'em, PIl see about&#xD;
it. Now you've got an arrant back, and you may trot and&#xD;
carry it as soon as you like."&#xD;
The widow's eye blinked black and sly as. she looked at&#xD;
Sonsie. She felt sure that her daughter was deeply mortified,&#xD;
and would be obliged to return and beg for mercy; and she&#xD;
had a quiver full of texts all ready for firing at her,&#xD;
"Ohplease, ma'am, don't send that word by me ; I couldn't&#xD;
bear the sorrow in her two eyes, so soft and kind, brimming over&#xD;
wid grief. I pray you to be merciful. She's a sweet darling&#xD;
entirely. Sure 'tis a blessing from  God, such a beautiful&#xD;
daughter !"&#xD;
" Well, I declare fort! A wicked messenger falleth into&#xD;
mischief. A fool uttereth all his mind.-Proverbs xiii. 17. I've&#xD;
had enough of you; take yourself off."&#xD;
"What's the marter, marn?" asked the peddler, who was&#xD;
coming up with the balance of the trade; "hired girl runnin'&#xD;
off?"&#xD;
"No, 'tis her daughter, the loveliest white angel! as. beauti-&#xD;
ful as a flax-flower. - I entreat this mother to be kind to her&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
" "1r daughter !" said the peddler, looking incredulously up&#xD;

and down the widow, and, stopping his eyes upon her wrinkled'&#xD;
visage, -".'white angel,!'. oh, shaw! get out !"&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith conned his application of Sonsie's statement&#xD;
in grim rage.&#xD;
"If you don't start, I'll take the broomstick to you ! you&#xD;
Irish hussey1". said she.&#xD;
"Come, come ! old woman; fetch the rest of them volumes.&#xD;
I'll be jogging before you females come to blows. I like cock-&#xD;
fights, and I think I should admire to witness a bull-fight; but&#xD;
a woman-fight ! - I'd rather shuffle off."&#xD;
" You may tell the 'white angel' I've sold her magazines for&#xD;
paper-rags," said the widow, jocosely, as she brought out the&#xD;
books, and threw them down upon the door-stone ; "there they&#xD;
be 1,nowshuffleoff, both on ye!"&#xD;
Shelaughed with.such music as a creaking grindstone makes,&#xD;
as she slammed the door and bolted it. Coming round to the&#xD;
window, after a little, she stopped and squinted out.&#xD;
"Seems as if I see a box or sunthin' ! What in the land&#xD;

sendin' that Irish hussey to me / I wonder if, she thought she&#xD;
could coax me /" (up went the widow's case-knife nose). "I'll&#xD;
burn up them, dads, lock, stock, and barrel, before I'll let her&#xD;
have 'em to flaunt up there in ! 'Sorry for her,' hey ? We4l,&#xD;
she'll be sorry for herself afore she's done with me. I'll bring&#xD;
her down on her marrow-bones !"&#xD;
"If you should be sick,"- what ailed the widow that she&#xD;
epuld not get rid of those few simple words,--" If you should be&#xD;
sick?" The lonely, room, the pale, helpless creature, stretched&#xD;
there to die ; ~no daughter love attending her. She gave the&#xD;
chair an unpleasant shove, as she turned from the window.&#xD;
" Eleven o'clock!i I'll have my season of prayer afore I pick -&#xD;

gladness is talken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in&#xD;
the vineyards there shall be no' singing, neither shall there be&#xD;
any shouting ! the treaders shall tread no wine in the presses.'"&#xD;
While the widow was enjoying her,comfortable doctrine, the&#xD;
peddler and Sonsie were driving gayly up the glen road, with&#xD;
Chris's trunk among the "tin .ovings," behind them.&#xD;
" Well, Ollam Folda, how do you like me in my new-charac-&#xD;
ter of Connie Sougah?" asked he, pulling off his stove-pipe,&#xD;
and feeling carefully of his sandy crop.&#xD;
" I think you are just splendid, siri As impudent and full of&#xD;
blarney as Barney hisser, and that is high praise."&#xD;
"Could you fancy playing Katie to me?      She was a&#xD;
sprightly lass, all mirth and pathos, just like you, Sonsie; and&#xD;
as stubborn as Ollam Folda, too.&#xD;
In a corner ofrmy heart, which nobsdy can see,&#xD;
Two eyes of Irish blue are always peeping out at me."&#xD;
Sonsie seemed not to notice the earnest face of the speaker,&#xD;
but she took up his song, and trolled it out so clear, that the&#xD;
deep solitudes of the grassy-glen repeated kindly the echo.&#xD;
" I wish ye'd take off all that hair and stuff, sir.". Sure I&#xD;
like your .face just. as your mother knows it, too well to look&#xD;
at it thus ; and if ye'd just stop by this clear brooklet, and&#xD;
give it a scrub or so, I'll hold the peddler's horse for ye, the&#xD;
while" (reaching out hands coaxingly toward the lines); "I&#xD;
think it was a shame of ye, all the ugly names ye threw at this&#xD;
pretty creature, the morn-! -Ollam Folda is bad enough, in es-&#xD;
pecial, when you fit it on to a Christian lassie."&#xD;
" The colt is honored, Sonsie, because he got his name o a&#xD;

nearly seven feet high, and a true Milesian, everybody knows;&#xD;
and his title fell upon as pretty a creature, to my eye, as ever&#xD;
tripped among the daisies ; and the first letters of her old name&#xD;
are Sonsie Eagan."&#xD;
"Come, Mr. Jan,"interrupted she, "let me hold yer horse till&#xD;
ye wash off the brick-dust from your face ; 'tis clear that ye are&#xD;
not able to speak the truth, with it lyin' so thick on your lips."&#xD;
" First tell me that you will play Katie-; and if you promise&#xD;
fair, I'll let-you drive your namesake, and -make him' step out&#xD;
his best."&#xD;
"I think.I could, sure, if I tried, sir ; I'd have to learn how&#xD;
first ; and do*ye mind how she danced the night, as light as a&#xD;
thistle-down that. floats amongst the lilies.  Oh, that was a&#xD;
brave evening, indeed, sir; better than the other, when Barney&#xD;
made- such a fool of hisself, in bringing the Irish folks into&#xD;
ridicule."&#xD;
Another opportunity lost. Jan felt like a coward ; when&#xD;
he had had the words all ready, and not been able to utter&#xD;
them ; but, poor fellow, her ripe mouth touched up into mis-&#xD;
chievous archness; her positive, self-asserting head, cocked a&#xD;
little on one side, and her merry eyes looking so modest-bold&#xD;
into the depths of his, were confusing, and the golden minute&#xD;
went by unused. - He would not wash his face, though, tilr he'&#xD;
had finished his work.&#xD;
Deb was sitting in her kitchen, like a house-god, with her&#xD;
hands fixed on her knees, and she rose and stepped to the&#xD;
door, in answer to their breezy call.&#xD;
"Here we are, Debby, acushla, ' snug as a pea in a pod '&#xD;
called out Sonsie, clapping her hands in glee. "Come, give us&#xD;
a lift, and we'll just flit it up close and fast, before anybody&#xD;
knows tY&#xD;
"Well, I never !" ejaculated Deb. ."I wouldn't like to be&#xD;

eye, now, I'm  afraid, before ye're done. Did ye coax and&#xD;
wheedle, and 'she eltin' away with her awsome scriptures, till&#xD;
ye tired her down;, or did ye break open the place, and carry&#xD;
it out with a high hand?"&#xD;
" We managed, Debby dear. Sure Mr. Jan is the one for&#xD;
charmin' the old ladies ; he'd steal the sweet notes out of the&#xD;
song-bird's throats, and they sleepin'."&#xD;
Jan blushed through his brick-dust, and fully made up his&#xD;
mind to charm a "yes " from the girl- he loved, before he was a&#xD;
week older, and was thinking how to do it, when she came out&#xD;
again.&#xD;
" All safe and done, Mr. Peddler."&#xD;
"Yes; but here are the books, Sonsie." He handed out the&#xD;
magazines. "Is it true that those are the cherished treasures of&#xD;
her daughter, which the old lady has traded off for tin-ware?"&#xD;
" Yes, sir, they are. Miss Chris showed them to me a thous-&#xD;
and times, and her own papa gave them. I've watched her&#xD;
touch them tenderly, with her pretty hands, as I'd linger me&#xD;
beads; and 'tis thrue for you, they're full of beautiful idication&#xD;
intirely."&#xD;
"Well, Sonsie," said Jan, with a visage 'of absolute disgust,&#xD;
"if you want my opinion upon a theological doctrine, I'll give&#xD;
it freely. I believe that the widow Goldsmith. will toast her&#xD;
feet at the good fire, that they don't rake up nights, in the con-&#xD;
genial society of Judas Iseariot, Esq."&#xD;
"If ye think that, Mr. Vedder, it will be a good place for&#xD;
ye to put some of your money, in masses to help ;her out of&#xD;
Purgatory," said Sonsie, slyly.&#xD;
"Purgatory I You don't believe any such trash as that, do&#xD;
you, Sonsie? And if it was Gospel truth, why should I help&#xD;
that old lady ?"&#xD;

" The fourth motive for praying for the dead, laid down in&#xD;
onr catechism, is our own interest; because the souls deliv-&#xD;
ered by our prayers will intercede for us before God, and aid&#xD;
to get us out of Purgatory, when our time comes.  That is&#xD;
what it says."&#xD;
" Well it don't say true, then ! and I'll tell you why. A bass-&#xD;
wood tree that you cut down to-day don't get to be a sugar.&#xD;
maple to-morrow, just because it has lain on the ground all&#xD;
night; and a treacherous, lying human soul, }that quits its body&#xD;
today, won't be an angel to-morrow; no, nor the day after, nor&#xD;
the, millennium after. If you burn a bass-wood tree, you get&#xD;
bass-wood ashes; and burning the soul of the widow, a thous-&#xD;
and years or so, is not going to change the quality of it. 'If&#xD;
she got out of Purgatory, and St. Peter let her in through .the&#xD;
pearly gateshe would be Widow Goldsmith still, and she'd&#xD;
cross and, rack her- daughter as fierce as ever, if she got the&#xD;
chance. Pain never purifies anybody. Penances don't count.&#xD;
People get tired of suffering, and are glad to get rid of it; but&#xD;
as forcleansing ! there's only one way for the healing of the na-&#xD;
tionsg,,and that is the atonement Christ made forus all. That's.&#xD;
so, Sonsie, just as sure as you're handsome ! all the masses this&#xD;
side of the New Jerusalem won't cleanse a single stain."&#xD;
The young girl took up.the books thoughtfully, and walked&#xD;
off, with her arrps full; and Jan's earnest words so unexpected,.&#xD;
both in tone and quality, still possessed her soul, when she laid&#xD;
them in the tower-room, and even while she explained the rea-&#xD;
son of their being there.&#xD;
Poor Chris's sense of fun was tickled with the adventure, and&#xD;
she laughed merrily, at first. But the sorrow came presently&#xD;
to the surface. Her position, shut out of her father's house,&#xD;
unloved, haken off; and she sat down and took a little cry, and&#xD;
Sonsie come out strong as~ comforter, and Deb trotted up to&#xD;

tell them that the peddler's horse was getting restive, and Son-&#xD;
sie, after a last hand-kiss, came down as bright and fresh as a&#xD;
rose-bud.&#xD;
"Come, Mr. Tin Oving, what'll I give ye to bring down me&#xD;
box to Mrs. Blair's, along wid yer skimmers and things ? Shall&#xD;
it be a sixpence, then ? "&#xD;
"Yes, I'll do it for a Yankee sixpence, Ollam Folda," replied&#xD;
Jan, laughing.&#xD;
" Cheap enough, isn't it, Debby dear," said Sonsie, with the&#xD;
reflective air of one who drives a hard bargain ; "and ye'll en-&#xD;
gage to lave itself up stairs, and not be tiring out me hands&#xD;
wid the weight of it."&#xD;
"Certainly ; on the top of the house, if you say so."&#xD;
"Don't ye think, Debby dear, that living along with the cute&#xD;
deacons and things is makin' me sharp at a contract?"&#xD;
"Don't let Mr.Vedder cheat you, Sonsie, girl," replied Deb;&#xD;
"look at the mischief in his eyes; he means a kiss."&#xD;
"And is it a kiss, sir ! If ye wish to be sweet friends wid me,&#xD;
ye must keep yer saucy tongue from such jests;" retorted&#xD;
the young maid, blushing like a red, red rose, as she walked&#xD;
off with her head up. Pretty soon she descended swiftly,&#xD;
showing an alarmed face.&#xD;
"I've lost me beautiful brooch !" said she. "I've tossed out&#xD;
all me things, and searched the whole place, and not a sight of&#xD;
it can Isee !&#xD;
"Nonsense, child !" Deb answered, stoutly, "'tis on your&#xD;
twilight. I saw it there with my. own eyes; and what's more, I&#xD;
took it into my hand, and looked at the glistening sheen of it."&#xD;
"I wish ye spake truth, Debby dear, as I knowlye meant;&#xD;
but 'tis not there at all; and so bonnie and green as it was;&#xD;
and such kind words as .I got wid it from Mr. Craigenfels!&#xD;
Oh, dear.! whatever'll 1 do I"&#xD;

Jan looked curiously at her, wondering if she knew the value&#xD;
of the gem.&#xD;
"Never mind, Sonsie. I daresay we can find its fellow at the&#xD;
jeweller's below ; don't fret after it ; how much did it cost, think&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
'-Sure, sir, I niver asked. It was for the pleasantness of the&#xD;
pretty day, and the kindness of the giver, that I valued it; not&#xD;
for the bit of money in it! A couple of dollars, it might be, or&#xD;
so, I suppose. I'll ask the young ladies did. they see it, and&#xD;
very soul on the place, till I get it, because St. Patrick hisself&#xD;
knows it didn't walk off alone."&#xD;
Belle Brandon was coming proudly down the broad piazza,&#xD;
dressed for a drive, and Uncle Alec, hat in hand, was keeping&#xD;
pace with her, chatting pleasantly, The glamour of her&#xD;
charms was about him. The harmony of her motions, of her&#xD;
well-chosen attire; the faint odor of heliotrope which she al-&#xD;
ways wafted around her ; the musical ripple of her graceful&#xD;
conversation; and the thousand nameless charms men found&#xD;
in her presence, - were telling upon the kind old fellow, who&#xD;
neither sought nor shunned his guest, but who, thoroughly en-&#xD;
joyed what she lavishly bestowed upon him.&#xD;
Sonsie walked straightup to her.&#xD;
"Miss Belle, did ye see me green brooch any place?"&#xD;
"What do you mean by such impertinence ?" demanded&#xD;
Belle, haughtily. "Where could I possibly see any belongings&#xD;
of yours, pray? except upon your robust personjwhich I will&#xD;
trouble you to remove out of my path), where I certainly&#xD;
should not give myself the pains to examine them." -&#xD;
Uncle Alec was amused with Sonsie's direct appeal, so un-&#xD;
conscious of the affront on the face of it; and he also could not&#xD;
helg admiring Belle's superb attitude of disdainful anger, even&#xD;
while he was obliged to disapprove rather of her reply.. "Edu-&#xD;

cation to blame," thought he; "and how transparently she&#xD;
shows all her feelings - artless girl!1"&#xD;
"Your winged words fly home more Hibernico, Roukie,"&#xD;
said he, quietly. " I don't imagine your emerald fairing is lost&#xD;
past recovery; those trifles have a trick of slipping out of sight&#xD;
occasionally. You will find it, never fear ; only set your Irish&#xD;
eyes peering into corners."&#xD;
"Indade, then, sir, I wish I had 'em as sharp as the Kelpie&#xD;
queen, that can see into the dark sea-caves, and lighten up so&#xD;
plain that folks are able to spy the tiny shells and fishes down&#xD;
there, and the elfin children, and all; and 'tis thrue for ye, if&#xD;
they'd look upon Miss Brandon once you could read ivery&#xD;
thought inside of her. Ah, wisha ! if she'd but rise in her  st&#xD;
mantle out of yon lake, and come amongst us, before the dy&#xD;
were a mint elder."&#xD;
UncleAlec smiled benignantly upon the blonde, counting&#xD;
the statement a choice compliment,; but there was something&#xD;
so like a threat in Sonsie's face that Belle felt half afraid of her,&#xD;
and she said with a pretty gushing smile, -&#xD;
" How full of odd superstitions these emerald Catholics are,&#xD;
sir !'&#xD;
"Superstitions, is it ! and there's not a true Irish girl livin'&#xD;
but would scorn the dirty tricks I've seen a lady do ; and the&#xD;
lyin', decavin' words I've caught off her tongue, and she lookin'&#xD;
like peaches and cream the whilst."&#xD;
Sonsie wheeled about, and Belle waited till she was out of&#xD;
ear-shot, before she said, easily, -&#xD;
"Depend upon it, Mr. Craigenfels, that girl knows what&#xD;
she's doing. She has either sold your beautiful brooch, or&#xD;
given it away to some clod-hopping lover. ' There's no end of&#xD;
deceit and tricking in those creatures."&#xD;
Uncle Alec,cwith the heir of Brookedge in his mind, laughed&#xD;

at the "clod-hopping lover," and was at considerable trouble to&#xD;
correct the young lady's fixed impressions concerning the serv-&#xD;
ing class, which, however, he thought sat rather prettily upon&#xD;
her, taking the form of dainty patrician prejudices ; and he&#xD;
reasoned and jested, and she listened archly, and accepted the&#xD;
role, and permitted herself to be gracefully convinced, and con-&#xD;
fessed to an awakened interest in the subject she had never&#xD;
experienced before, which of course was education again; and&#xD;
she looked bewitching when she exclaimed, " Oh, do tell me,&#xD;
sir, something I can do here. My mission people, at home,&#xD;
were so dirty and stupid, I must own, they did disgust me."&#xD;
The jolly peddler had heard the talk from his seat among the&#xD;
skimmers and pans, and his eyes laughed as he climbed .down&#xD;
and shambled towards the aristocratic pair, who were waiting&#xD;
for Black Tramp and the phaeton. His whip was stuck under&#xD;
his arm, and his rusty hat tilted- over his left ear, as he&#xD;
scratched hissandy crop.&#xD;
"Want to buy any tin notions, marm?  I've come all the&#xD;
way from Bosting, in my one-horse wagging, with a lot of tin&#xD;
ovings."&#xD;
"Now, really, Mr. Craigenfels, you must not scold my hyper-&#xD;
delicacy, if I withdraw a. little from this specimen of Yankee&#xD;
vulgarity, which stands out all over him, like the quills upon&#xD;
the fretful porcupine. Ah, sir, your doctrine is tottering;&#xD;
surely no educating process could ever bring a gentleman out&#xD;
of such material," - Belle stepped back and drew up her robe.&#xD;
"Now, my dear young lady !" expostulated Uncle Alec,&#xD;
how are you going to bear the rough places in life, if you&#xD;
shrink away so, like my mimosas, from all coarse off-shoots of&#xD;
fallen humanity ?"  But while he talked, Belle knew that he&#xD;
did not the less admire her for her daintiness.&#xD;

"TBERE'S NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL."&#xD;

"Skimmers, basins, toasting-forks 1" continuedthe persistent&#xD;
peddler.&#xD;
Uncle Alec waved him off.&#xD;
" No, no, my good fellow ; I'm afraid you are on a fool's&#xD;
errand to-day. Perhaps I ought -to apologize ; but really I&#xD;
don't want any thing in your.particular line. Deborah !"&#xD;
"Fool's arrant! no sir-ee! I kum in special to fetch up a&#xD;
trunk for my particular friend, Miss Goldsmith, and she's far&#xD;
from a fool. She's got the chist all safe, but I feel it my dooty&#xD;
to be diligent -in business. No offence to that young woman,&#xD;
I hope ; she didn't think I was arter her, did she ? not if I&#xD;
know myself. She does stick up that little nose of her the&#xD;
darndest!"&#xD;
"Astonishing, sir, how our dear old Chris makes choice of&#xD;
such odd particular friends, is it not ? You really ought to&#xD;
lecture her, as well as poor little me," said Belle, maneuvring&#xD;
her eyes; "but with that originality she prides herself so much&#xD;
upon, oue never knows what she may do next. Some' of her&#xD;
school experiences were rather remarkable. I must tell you&#xD;
some time about a picture Chandy made of her."&#xD;
Uncle Alec lost half the value of Belle's. speech, and the&#xD;
lissomnes of her supple notions, which she saw a good chance&#xD;
to display, floating down. the steps to pluck a purple hyacinth,&#xD;
which she placed in her bosom. -.He heard Chris's voice, and&#xD;
he stepped to the stair-foot, that he might get a look at his&#xD;
little pet, and pall her " Daught, Queen Pansy-Fredrika," and&#xD;
so on, out of tie abundance of his great kindness and sympa-&#xD;
thy; and he came out again, just in time to hear the peddler&#xD;
make Belle an offer.&#xD;
-"If ye'aud like a lift deaun to teaun, marm, -you seem to'&#xD;

"Spark !" exclaimed Belle. "I do not comprehend your&#xD;
low expression; but though 'tis of no consequence to you, I&#xD;
will inform you that my ruby.is an heirloom --has been in our.&#xD;
family for several generations."&#xD;
The jolly peddler laughed.&#xD;
"Is that so ?" said he, "Well, when I was a boy, I read in&#xD;
my old English Reader a cute story about a Palace of Truth.&#xD;
I should like to see you in it. You'd feel kinder queer,&#xD;
wouldn't you? Well, it looks pretty on your little finger, and&#xD;
you are welcome to it. You won't ride in my cart ! Well,&#xD;
never mind; here's a hansum girl that spriggin' up ; can't make&#xD;
any hansumer: 'I guess I'll ask her instid."&#xD;
" Thanks, brave Connie Sougah," said Sonsie, springing up.&#xD;
"I shall be very grateful for the lift. Good-by, Mr. Craigen-&#xD;
fels."&#xD;
They rattled full tilt down the avenue, the-"tin ovings" clat-&#xD;
tering behind them; and while Uncle Alec was laughing at the&#xD;
amazing grandeur of Belle's reception of the-peddler's advances,&#xD;
which is beyond all my word-painting, he snapped his fingers.&#xD;
" Of course it is,"-said he. "Why didn't I see it before?&#xD;
Some bit of fun; and Sonsie with him.  Deborah!" he called&#xD;
out, as, having seated the blonde in the phaeton, he drove up&#xD;
to the. kitchen door, " Deborah, wasn't that Mr. Jan Ved-&#xD;
der?"S&#xD;
"Yes, sir, it were. He and Sonsie got Miss Chris's clothes&#xD;
$ut of the old lady by a merry trick, which was their errand up&#xD;
here to fetch them. They are a heartsome pair- of children,&#xD;
&#xD;
"=THERE'S NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL."        403&#xD;
sir, and a good morning's work that they did. Miss Chrissie is&#xD;
all right, now, sir!'"&#xD;
Uncle Alec forgot, in listening to Deb's story, all Jan's talk&#xD;
with the beauty at his side, who exerted her varied powers to&#xD;
fix his every thought upon herself, and certainly he passed a be-&#xD;
wilderingly delightful morning.&#xD;
As they were driving through Gonecusset Street, Belle leaned&#xD;
forward, and clasped her hands in lovely rapture.&#xD;
" There is Mary Ann Williams, Mr. Craigenfels ! Do let&#xD;
me speak to her !"&#xD;
Of course Uncle Alec drew rein instantly, and was ,really&#xD;
pleased with the beauty's enthusiastic fondness for her friends.&#xD;
"Dearest Millithy Nilithy !" she called, in musical accent,&#xD;
"come right directly, and say how d'ye to your own Belle. Are-&#xD;
you not glad to see me ? So hard-hearted of you not to run up&#xD;
and kiss me, the instant I got home - to Craigenfels, I mean "&#xD;
(a gushing blush, a bewitching apology with her soft hand laid&#xD;
lightly upon the large white one of her' host); "but I know&#xD;
you're married, and I must congratulate you. Of course, you&#xD;
have got the most wonderful husband, haven't you? and he is&#xD;
not Cabby, after all. Oh, you naughty, flirting Millithy! I&#xD;
must positively scold you, for your inconstant trifling with that&#xD;
youth's-tender heart."&#xD;
Mrs. Nickson's cheek got paler, and she shrank away, as from&#xD;
a deadly serpent; and Belle who made the opportunity to show&#xD;
off her gushingness and her dimples and her voice and her&#xD;
lovingness, went on, -&#xD;
" Come, darling, and tell me where to find you; Imust talk&#xD;
up old times ! 'Do you live in this handsome place ?"&#xD;
"Yes -I do; I have but just returned ;" answered Mary&#xD;
Ann, with some effort :- "but I do not wish you to come here,&#xD;
or to speak to me; you and I are strangers. I don't think I'&#xD;

404    "THIARE'S NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL,"&#xD;
could do you any good, and I fear that you have still some&#xD;
power to do me harm; I am sorry that I have seen you, because&#xD;
your face is like a dreadful nightmare to me."&#xD;
She drew dow~ her veil, and walked inside her gate, and hid&#xD;
herself behind her own door, as from.a hateful enemy.&#xD;
Belle darted a quick look at the gentleman by her side, wh&#xD;
was mentally comparing the two types of womanhood and&#xD;
who fastened his eyes upon the banker's wife in stern dis-&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
Though she had not calculated upon such a reception, ex.&#xD;
pecting to impress her foil with her elegance, and also counting&#xD;
that the passiveness of the subdued girl would prevent her&#xD;
bfeaking out before strangers, even if she still cherished re-&#xD;
sentment for the past, she saw by Uncle Alec's face that she&#xD;
need not despair of making capital out of the scene, and she&#xD;
sank back with a stifled cry, and covered her eyes.&#xD;
"Oh, sir, do take me away !" she murmured, faintly; "I'm&#xD;
so hurt !  And that girl was my friend; she used to cling&#xD;
around my neck.. But times are changed now; I am not useful&#xD;
any more. Iam poor -she shakes me off. Oh, dear Mr.&#xD;
Craigenfels, do take me home, to your home, and let me hide&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
The kind old fellow put his arm around the suffering child,&#xD;
and she did hide her face, -curls, dimples, and all, -upon&#xD;
his ample waistcoat; and it took a deal of comforting to soothe&#xD;
her ruffled feelings. She. executed no end of'pretty childish&#xD;
exclamations, "with her rich voice luting soft," and graceful&#xD;
gestures; and raised her eyes, tear-wet and imploring, and&#xD;
manoeuvred her lips, tremulous with the depth of her sorrow;&#xD;
and she brought out brighter the peachy-bloom of" her right&#xD;
cheek with a dexterous little pinch, so that the afituent gorgeous&#xD;

Deb would have looked very sourly upon the pair, out of her&#xD;
common-sense eyes, and said once again, " There's no fool like&#xD;
an old fool," had she been an eyewitness of the proceedings.&#xD;
And really Miss Brandon accomplished a good deal for one&#xD;
morning. First she improvised a sprightly account of her&#xD;
friendship with Mrs. Nickson, which was a credit to her inven-&#xD;
tive genius. She did -the "friendless orphan" " trusting, un-&#xD;
protected innocence," "lonely poverty," and was absolutely&#xD;
artistic in each. She couldn't attend dearest Zoe's wedding--&#xD;
no dress : her ugly, cross, old ogre of an aunt (the, ogre touched&#xD;
up so elaborately, with heart-softening childish experiences,&#xD;
that I doubt if the selfish, easy-going Tante Isadore, who was&#xD;
simply a woman of fashion, would have recognized the picture,&#xD;
or been able to rememberjall the horrid cruelties she had in&#xD;
flicted upon her niece). "She hated poor little me, Mr. Craigen-&#xD;
fels, simply because people said I was nice, as if that was my&#xD;
fault !" etc.&#xD;
Belle got sympathy, and caresses, and what she valued more&#xD;
than all, -- she got lavish offers of everything that money could&#xD;
buy; and better still, they two proceeded to the telegraph office,&#xD;
and together wrote a despatch ordering from Madam Corsage&#xD;
a costly dress, point-lace flowers, gloves, fan ; and she was so&#xD;
witty and bright, that Uncle Alec considered buying woman's&#xD;
gear by telegraph, the most delightful. of amusements, and still&#xD;
kept on saying,*pendil in hand, with genial, enjoying face,&#xD;
"What next, my dear?   Now do try to think of something&#xD;
more."&#xD;
After the long list was complete, Belle pondered for one&#xD;
instant the .feasibility of mentioning diamonds, in case she&#xD;
should finally have to take Zambrano; but she-thought better&#xD;
of it, and laughingly assured hin that even a wishing-ing could&#xD;
do no more for her, and Watched the process of appending the&#xD;

banker's- order, in a pleasing state of childish ecstacy.  Ah,&#xD;
Deb, what do you think now ?-and such a long-headed, far.&#xD;
sighted gentleman too! Yes, Miss Brandon's pulse beat high;&#xD;
she was very near her . object, -- money, money, plenty of&#xD;
money. Like poor Miss Kilmanseg with her auriferous leg, the&#xD;
beauty's dream was of "gold, gold, gold ; bright and yellow,&#xD;
and hard and cold !" and "really," she speculated, while fur.&#xD;
tively studying her host's face,&#xD;
"Really, the husband-incumbrance I shall be forced to take&#xD;
with it is not so very bad, all things considered. Of course,&#xD;
Zambrano is handsome, of the dark style who would make&#xD;
me look fairer by contrast when I lean on his arm, and there.&#xD;
fore a very becoming husband to have; and he is passably&#xD;
rich. But he sinks into insignificance when I compare him&#xD;
with this Mexican mine ; and then Zambrano is so frightfully&#xD;
jealous, and this golden bowl of an old gentleman she [smiled as&#xD;
she thought how pat was her description of Uncle Alec's rotund&#xD;
figure] possesses the blandest and most manageable of tem-&#xD;
pers."  Ah ! she had never seen him roused by injustice or&#xD;
duplicity; she did not know how his standard demanded abso-&#xD;
lute truth, -absolute purity, in his beloved ones, especially&#xD;
women; and as for going on to a Cuban plantation, - that was&#xD;
out of the question.&#xD;
"What were joys of the Pastoral kind&#xD;
To a bride town-made-heart and mind,&#xD;
Of simplicity never a lover?&#xD;
Who hated lanes, and who hated fields,&#xD;
Who hated all that the country yields-&#xD;
And barely knew turnips from clover."&#xD;
Miss Brandon, had a secret plan, which she scarcely dared&#xD;
breathe to herself; it required such delicatenanipulation.&#xD;
There were so many about her who knew her thoroughly, and&#xD;
&#xD;
"THERE'S NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL."            407&#xD;
who did not love her, - Mary Ann, for instance, who had turned&#xD;
like the worm that objects to being trodden on, that very morn-&#xD;
ing; and that Sonsie ! she was afraid of nothing, and wakefully&#xD;
dangerous; and Ruth Blair ! she had ascertained, to her exceed-&#xD;
ing satisfaction, that she was out of the way, time of absence&#xD;
unlimited.  Any one of these, and many more, might drop.&#xD;
words into Uncle Alec's ears, at some chance moment, which&#xD;
would effectually blast her prospects; and she was inly anxious&#xD;
and unceasingly restless, beneath her sprightly careless gushing,&#xD;
ness, till she could fairly sit down at ease in the. position she&#xD;
was working for.  And as to Zambrano! -"Oh, may some&#xD;
kind mishap tie him close, - a little fever, or the small-pox,&#xD;
till it is over, and he cannot help himself!" she.thought, as she&#xD;
parted with her host in the wide hall of the grand old place she&#xD;
meant to own. Such a look as she gave the dear old fellow!&#xD;
such a dainty, delicate, modest little hand-squeeze before she&#xD;
floated off; and such a kiss as she threw him from -the stair-&#xD;
head, bending her radiant face, and smiling!t Oh, well, never&#xD;
mind; don't talk about it. While she sat in front of her cheval-&#xD;
glass, she let her imagination revel among her coming pleasures,&#xD;
close at hand, almost sure, - their town-house, opera-hox,&#xD;
jewels, her Paris trip; and it were a pity, for the- sake of the&#xD;
true heart she was capturing, to have to add, her many admirers.&#xD;
And she turned her neck "regal white," and cast about her&#xD;
disdainful glances,-and caressed her creamy arms, and smiled.&#xD;
You never saw such a smile ! such steely blue eyes!-&#xD;
"And she dons her silken vestments white,&#xD;
And tricks her hair in lovely plight,&#xD;
And nothing doubting of her spell,"&#xD;
she descends to keep watch over the treasure she fears to lose,&#xD;
fully determined, to put herself; as much as possible, between&#xD;
him and everybody else.&#xD;

<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7818-00000204"/>&#xD;
408    "THERE'S NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL."&#xD;
In the self-same half-hour before dinner, Uncle Alec smoked&#xD;
a cigar in the library; ,and seriously debated with himself the&#xD;
question, -&#xD;
" Have I a right to take this wonderful girl, so rich in charms,&#xD;
so defenceless, so simple, to my heart, and shield her, and watch&#xD;
her sweet blooming, and worship her?  Shall I be so selfish?&#xD;
What have I to offer her?"o-&#xD;
He got up, and strolled across the great room, and gazed at&#xD;
the stout figure his mirror showed him, -the grizzled hair,&#xD;
ruddy face, and powerful manhood which, at fifty, was his in&#xD;
perfection; and while he felt it a pity that there certainly was&#xD;
crows-feet at the corners of his eyes (he had never noticed.them&#xD;
so plainly before, nor the other footprints of spiteful Time, all&#xD;
over his youth), still he felt almost positive that the beauty liked&#xD;
him, and as he heartily meant to gratify her in every wish she&#xD;
could possibly devise, he very nearly made uphis mind that he&#xD;
might at least give her the chance to say "no."  There could&#xD;
be no harm in that, though he stroked his silky beard, while he&#xD;
reflected on the say-so of the talkers, -- "June and November,"&#xD;
and the like.. Well, he would leave it to the pretty child her-&#xD;
self.. But if she. would of her own accord take his hand, and&#xD;
nestle to his heart, his life should be her's -- his wealth, every&#xD;
thing.&#xD;

HE avenue between the elms was scarcely clear that&#xD;
morning of the peddler's cart and the master's phae-&#xD;
ton, before Sabrina's pony-carriage came sweeping&#xD;
over its gravel, and that queenly lady and little brown Zoe de-&#xD;
scended, bearing a square box, which they carried straight to the&#xD;
tower-room, where they found our Chris busied in removing her&#xD;
clothing from the trunk. In setting her belongings in order she&#xD;
had come across.her golden comb; 'and both from a dear love&#xD;
to its giver, - a sorrowful sweet thought of her happy journey&#xD;
up to Rosenbloom, - and the freedom it gave her to work at&#xD;
ease, she kissed it, and twined her curls around it, and fastened&#xD;
them, leaving some luxuriant beauties to stray' over, and caress&#xD;
it at will. Her face looked clear cut, her profile statuesque,&#xD;
and her ,ears like little rosy shells. She had thrown aside her&#xD;
sacque ; and her neck and round arms gleamed exceeding fair,&#xD;
and Uncle Alec's chain of frosted gold and its tiny cross of&#xD;
blue enamel caressed her bosom, and Max's bracelet of sap-&#xD;
phires sparkled upon her arm; but she- was sorrowful and&#xD;
disturbed. In fact, she was weeping bitterly. Her two, friends,&#xD;
who knew every trick of her face, in every one 'of its changing&#xD;
moods, pretended not to observe her tears while they kissed&#xD;
her, because they saw that she wished to hide them ; and they&#xD;
immediately undid the box and laid out its contents, talking&#xD;
busily of the-approaching wedding.&#xD;
"We've ordered your festal apparel, Chris, darling, because&#xD;
we must have the third of our trio before the altar, when I&#xD;
make an April-fool of myself; and is it nota love? We knew&#xD;

you would be a 'white angel,' as Sonsie says, in pearl color.&#xD;
There, I told you so !" - she added, gazing admiringly at the&#xD;
loveliness before her, after she had fastened the last button.&#xD;
"You are just as sweet as you can be, and live ! And Chris,&#xD;
darling, you approve our selection, don't you?  You see Uncle&#xD;
Alec told us to buy any thing we'd a mind for 'little pet.' He&#xD;
just worships you, Chris. We get fearfully jealous some times,&#xD;
I assure you."&#xD;
"iDo you?" said Chris.  "Well, I'll tell you a secret. Deb&#xD;
has been up here, sobbing and crying. She says Craigenfels is&#xD;
to get a mistress, in the person of Belle Brandon; and though.&#xD;
it will break her old heart to leave the old place, where her&#xD;
Bessie used to skipple and frolic, she will never stay to see the&#xD;
disgrace and misery she feels sure will be her kind master's&#xD;
portion."&#xD;
"Impossible !" exclaimed Sabrina, loftily. "Why, Uncle&#xD;
Alec is a wise, sensible man !"&#xD;
" I've thought about it myself," replied Zoe. "I know she&#xD;
means to get him if she can. I wish with all my heart that&#xD;
you'd gone to bed and to sleep, before you packed off to Wal-&#xD;
lack's that night. All our troubles spring from your childish&#xD;
passion for the drama; I couldn't bear to have her come to this&#xD;
dear castle of ours ; it seems like profaning a shrine, to have&#xD;
her plucking our flowers, reading our books, and generally dis.&#xD;
porting herself in a place which we have always called our&#xD;
chateau en Espagne; and as for seeing her Uncle Alec's wife I1&#xD;
I don't feel as if I could possibly bear it."&#xD;
"My darling soul, my- precious opal ! be 'assured, that the&#xD;
idea is simply absurd. Why, Uncle Alec is as old as papa,&#xD;
and Belle Brandon is a month younger than I am."&#xD;
"4My Uncle Tom was-sixty-two, and he married his ward, who&#xD;
was just sixteen," suggested Zoe.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. OTHO -GROENVELDT BIDES HIS TIME. 411&#xD;
"Your Uncle Tom was a fool guo ad hoc. Not so dear&#xD;
Uncle Alec. I shall not think of such a thing for an instant !"&#xD;
"Oh, very well, ' dear, don't, then ; and I fervently hope&#xD;
Uncle Alec won't think of it, either; and Chris, you must come&#xD;
over the hills and far away with us. My pretties have all&#xD;
arrived, and I intend'to pass this afternoon in trying them on ;&#xD;
and we are to have the Vedders (and Sonsie, if Jan can coax&#xD;
her) in the evening, and Uncle Alec, and, I suppose, the bete&#xD;
noire, Belle Brandon ; and papa Bradshaw has promised to&#xD;
bring his violin, and we will have some dancing. Only a few&#xD;
more of our pleasant girl-gatherings, you know; oh dear, I&#xD;
hope you won't count me out afterward, make me an odd&#xD;
one."&#xD;
Zoe fingered the flowers of her breast-knot, pulled to pieces&#xD;
her ptnegranate, and scattered ruthlessly its scarlet petals.&#xD;
"If I thought you would," she pouted, "I'd cut Peter adrift&#xD;
now, and never get married at all."&#xD;
1Ah ! how many a young girl has faltered, and trembled on&#xD;
the threshold of her new life. Yea ! and how many have&#xD;
entered it, to be tricked or tyrannized out of tleir rigfuihappi&#xD;
ness.'&#xD;
Sabrina went up and kissed the little nut-brown Gypsy, and&#xD;
assured her that her place in the trio should never be vacant.&#xD;
"Well! I hope so, and I'll have to trust you anyhow; be.&#xD;
cause I could not get rid of that silly Peter if I tried it - he's&#xD;
such a stick-tight t"&#xD;
Zoe's eyes caught sight of a box on the table, and she flew&#xD;
toward it, exclaiming, " Oh! what lovely something or other&#xD;
have you got inside, Chris ? may I peep a little ?"&#xD;
"Nay, my Eve, you may not."  Chris laid her hand upon&#xD;
the cover. ."Bridle your curiosity, thou daughter of our&#xD;
mother: the time is not yet." And so she kept her secret&#xD;

of a set of mouchoirs, beautifully wrought in monograms of&#xD;
field-flowers, for the bride's cadeau.&#xD;
"Well, of a truth, then, I may see this !"' She lifted a sketch&#xD;
which her friend had but shortly before taken from her trunk,&#xD;
in a frame of braided straw-work, so contrived' that both sides&#xD;
of the card-board were visible.&#xD;
" Chris ! perfect !" Chris about to utter some choice pro.&#xD;
verb ; - "and -what ! whose work is this, pray ?" she ex.&#xD;
claimed, indignantly. "Shameful, abominable."&#xD;
"Oh, that is my skull and cross.bone," replied Chris, quietly.&#xD;
"I kneel and pray before that every morning, though it is the&#xD;
work of no saintly fingers."&#xD;
"What does it mean, Chris ?"-&#xD;
"This side means love and Chandy ; this, means Belle Bran.&#xD;
don."&#xD;
The girls exchanged glances.&#xD;
" Tell us about it," said Zoe.&#xD;
"I have heard something of that picture, Chris, darling ; but,&#xD;
of course I could never mention it to you, unless you chose to&#xD;
let me," observed Sabrina.&#xD;
"But why didn't you tell me, then !" added Zoe, quickly.&#xD;
"Because I never speak of such of my friends' affairs as I&#xD;
think they desire shall not be made a subject of conversation."&#xD;
Deborah entered with a plate - of tartlets for Chris and her&#xD;
friends ; and that young lady put the good creature into an&#xD;
easy-chair, and sat down on her lap, with one arm around het&#xD;
neck while she ate.&#xD;
"She lets me hold her," explained Deb, humbly, "because&#xD;
she knows I love to. She's like my own sweet Bessie to me.&#xD;
Hasn't she got the pretty neck and the bonnie white arm!&#xD;
the dear" (patting her softly); and then she whispered in her&#xD;
favorite's ear, " You should t ought to eat tartlets in -your wed.&#xD;

ding. gown, darlin, cause. 'tis a hateful omen?_an besides, you&#xD;
might spoil it with the flakes of the puff, you know."&#xD;
Chris colored, and jumped up. "Undo it, Debby dear, and&#xD;
let me out of it."  She had forgotten all about her finery, and&#xD;
she feared her friends might think her careless and under-valu--&#xD;
ing their trouble and kindness. "Come !now, I am in my&#xD;
gray frock, and I only took a little bite, and you shall tell me&#xD;
the omen. I love your signs and wonders. How you used to&#xD;
make my flesh creep when I was a child, with those Norse tales&#xD;
you told in the gloaming ! "&#xD;
" Well, darlin', I've heard say that if a girl eats in a new&#xD;
dress she will wear to a bridal, she'll have to see the begin-&#xD;
ning or the ending of a death before she takes it off and the&#xD;
wedding guests have gone home."&#xD;
" Oh, Deborah ! what a ghastly old saw that is ! Lucky you&#xD;
did not swallow the whole of your tartlet,- Chris; though, of&#xD;
course, there's nothing in it," remarked Sabrina.&#xD;
"Tell us about the picture," said Zoe, quickly; "Deb makes&#xD;
me nervous."&#xD;
" I didn't go to, Miss Zoe; but my young lady, she bade me&#xD;
speak it, and I had to. I'm sorry. 'Tis only an old woman's&#xD;
sign, after all, you know."&#xD;
Chris had some trouble to comfort her old friend'; and :the&#xD;
quicker to accomplish it, she bade her listen to the tale of the&#xD;
picture.&#xD;
"What a plotting Jesuit that girl is !"- remarked Sabrina,&#xD;
thoughtfully.&#xD;
"Why didn't you. let us send her to Coventry ?". said&#xD;
Zoe. "I wonder you can endure her near you."&#xD;
" I do not love her, certainly ; but I profited by her lesson,&#xD;
did I notw? That was a true picture of Christabel Goldsmith,&#xD;
as those who love her best knowr full well. Is it true nowv?"&#xD;

414 MR. 0T0 GROENVELDT BIDES HIS TIME.&#xD;
Chris glance into her mirror; and Zoe flew at her and&#xD;
devoured her with kisses. Deb quietly made up her mind to a&#xD;
move on the board in which that picture should serve he&#xD;
the very first minute she could make it successful.&#xD;
Chris put on her hat as she was desired, and the trio went&#xD;
down to the library, to wait while Tommy was bringing round,&#xD;
the ponies.&#xD;
" Heigh hot!" said Zoe, flitting restlessly about, "I wonder&#xD;
who will be married next? We know that poor Peebles went&#xD;
mourning home, even as Rachel mourned for her children, refus,&#xD;
ing to be comforted. Chris, somehow I can see but one des.&#xD;
tiny before you, and that is the one you found among the&#xD;
daisies. I hope you may be endowed with strength to rise&#xD;
equal to it ; and do try to get your own way sometimes, when&#xD;
the .terrible time does come. As for me, my motto is 'Down&#xD;
with tyrants.' I shall train Peter to implicit obedience. I&#xD;
am started correctly, and I intend always to do precisely as&#xD;
I please."&#xD;
Sabrina laughed, remembering the snubbing her rosy-cheeked&#xD;
brother, had gotten, Christmas evening, at the hands of his be.&#xD;
trothed, and she could not refrain from a malicious remark.&#xD;
"Now, really, Zoe, would you go back to school if you were&#xD;
me, or not. I wish you would talk with Peter about it."&#xD;
Zoe.colored, pouted, and then laughed.&#xD;
"We must get a husband that will keep you in order, my&#xD;
topping friend. There's Hauxhurst, or Chandy, or Sam. He&#xD;
used to rave over your auburn tresses. By the way, dear, it is&#xD;
always a mystery how.you became possessed of your amber&#xD;
locks; your mother has hair like finest flax, and your father&#xD;
wears a shock as black as a Tonawanda's." .&#xD;
"I don't know, I'm sure. . Oh yes, I do, though. .It is  i&#xD;
our family. I had an aunt who married a red head."&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. O0THO GROENTELDT BIDES HIS TIME. 415&#xD;
Chris had gone off suddenly into one of her reveries, with&#xD;
eyes dreamily fastened upon her friend, so that she did not&#xD;
hear the solution of the mystery, nor Zoe's laugh. Pretty soon&#xD;
she said, fingering the red braids,-&#xD;
"'Tis -like Jane Shores, Zoe.  We are told that the -Coun-&#xD;
tess of Cardigan had a lock cut from the head of that unfortu-&#xD;
nate_; marvellously beautiful, seeming to be powdered with&#xD;
gold-dust, without prejudice to its silken delicacy.&#xD;
"Very good, Chris; and true, too.. I do enjoy your fashion&#xD;
of bringing out things.  It is ever so nice.  But I want to talk&#xD;
about getting married now.   When 'shall we put -roses and&#xD;
buds into our hair for your adding, Sabrina?"&#xD;
"When the Bobolink courts the owl&#xD;
And the mouse the porcupine,&#xD;
When apple-trees grow in a bowl&#xD;
And topers get merry on brine,&#xD;
When the thistle-down swims on the sea&#xD;
And the nautilus flies in the air,&#xD;
When the king comes a-courting to me&#xD;
And praises my raven hair,&#xD;
in short, when every thing is upside down and inside out,&#xD;
then, perhaps, I may fall into love, and bend my will to a&#xD;
master."&#xD;
The door was open into the octagon room beyond the&#xD;
library, where the Mexican and Brazilian treasures were kept,&#xD;
and the gilded idols stood in silent rows in front of the rain-&#xD;
bow-tinted shells; and Mr. Otho Groenveldt, carrying a bottle&#xD;
of glue in his hand, having his coat sleeves turned back,&#xD;
begirded with a vast canvas apron, came through it, and&#xD;
bowed to the amazed trio.&#xD;
"May I ask whither you are bounds young ladies ?"&#xD;
Instantly each turned her thoughts around what she had&#xD;
been saying since she entered the library ; and Zee made a&#xD;

side grimace, as she remembered the opinions she had aired of&#xD;
the grave young doctor, who was standing before her with a&#xD;
composed mien. If he had heard their talk, there was no evi.&#xD;
dence of it about him, he being as close-faced and polite as&#xD;
usual.&#xD;
" Oh, yes, sir, there are some mortals who seem to have a&#xD;
vocation for asking questions, and we will take it for granted&#xD;
that you are one of them. We are about to carry off our&#xD;
Chris, an unresisting captive."&#xD;
"I am of opinion that you have made an unauthorized&#xD;
statement, Miss Zoe, which events will'fail to corroborate. I&#xD;
have need for Miss Goldsmith to-day among these Brazilian".,&#xD;
butterflies, and I shall be forced to detain her. I'll lend you&#xD;
Bertha, if you like, guid pro guo, who is as good as the best."&#xD;
"Why not keep Bertha for yourself, sir," asked Chris, chafing&#xD;
under his masterful mien and quiet appropriation of her, with-&#xD;
out even the ceremony of asking her consent; but still curi-&#xD;
ously humble in her tone and attitude.&#xD;
"Simply because Bertha would be of no use to me, and you&#xD;
fulfil all the conditions, -memory, accuracy, readiness, atten-&#xD;
tion, and'good Portuguese."&#xD;
Sabrina and Zoe listened, and looked at the' two in surprise,&#xD;
and with a feeling of impatience.&#xD;
"What.if we decline to leave our Chris?  There is a class&#xD;
of whoyi we are told that even their tender mercies are cruel-&#xD;
ties," said Sabrina, a little poutedly ; "and what if she refuses&#xD;
to stay, and being 'a girl of some spirit, I think she will&#xD;
refuse."&#xD;
Permit me to say very politely, Miss Bradshaw, that I&#xD;
shall recognize but one party in our operations, which is Wss&#xD;
Chris herself; and she W-ill choose to stay.; first, because I&#xD;
desire it ; secondly, because she likes the sort of work. I offer&#xD;

her. She possesses (we all know quite well) many admirable&#xD;
qualities; among them, self-denial, kindness, and amazing&#xD;
helpfulness, and she is about to put in use her virtues. You&#xD;
will find Bertha in the drawing-room writing letters; and I feel&#xD;
sure she will pleasantly ride bodkin in, your phaeton, eat salt&#xD;
at your hospitable table, and lend herself readily to any little&#xD;
mysteries you have in hand."&#xD;
The two girls were positive and self-willed enough ; but&#xD;
somehow Mr. Otho's peculiar manner, half-jesting, half-grave,&#xD;
and his politely cool dismissal of them, hindered any show of&#xD;
resentment. Zoe did try one word, though.&#xD;
"'Tis for you to say, Chris, I think ; will you not abide by&#xD;
your resolution and come along with us ?"&#xD;
",No, Zoe, thank you," answered Chris, faintly. "I think&#xD;
perhaps I ought to stay if I.can be of use. I'll come down&#xD;
after dinner ; I'll ride Zephyr."&#xD;
"I told you so, Miss Walsingham! When Sapho turns up&#xD;
her curls in that fashion it means business. In Lesbos it meant&#xD;
sonnets; to-day a paste brush will take the place of a pen in&#xD;
her poetic fingers, and a pot of glue will do for ink. The&#xD;
poetry is ready to her hand ; she is about to- arrange and clas-&#xD;
sify it. Au revoir, young ladies ; I'll keep my captive safe ;&#xD;
and I will promise by my faith to give you a sight of her face&#xD;
before the moon sets."&#xD;
Chris felt shy and awkward when Otho led the way into the&#xD;
cabinet, and she hesitated; and lingered, uncertain of herself,&#xD;
and dreading him; he set her the work he needed, and brought&#xD;
out an apron and bib, which he fastened around her neck, and&#xD;
her slender waist, and in half an hour she was smiling, bright&#xD;
and busy. The cloud'had lifted from her eyes, the droop left&#xD;
her lips, and her interest. and attention were concentrated upon.&#xD;
her occupation and her co-worker. Mr. Otho was- serene and&#xD;

joyous. He had carried his point with a high hand, and had&#xD;
gotten Chris all to himself for a whole morning, and he&#xD;
plunged heartily into the enjoyment he meant to have, both&#xD;
for her and himself. His deep-toned voice was musical, and&#xD;
he knew from the face he loved' to study that Chris was&#xD;
pleased with his gathering of many themes, bringing odd con-&#xD;
ceits and quaint quotations to bear upon their occupation, and&#xD;
he was as fond as De Quincy himself of hunting his topics to&#xD;
earth. He always set Chris's brain working, and afforded her&#xD;
double pleasure, because her absolutely perfect memory ena-&#xD;
bled her to reproduce any conversation in completeness; and&#xD;
she took up her studies with vital energy after one of their&#xD;
communings, quickened and revivified by agreeable converse&#xD;
with his intellect; she knew the color of the familiar delight;&#xD;
she had pined for it in secret, mourned over it as lost ; and now&#xD;
this morning, among the-shining beetles and bugs, and the gay-&#xD;
colored moths, she appetized it with the same keen relish as&#xD;
if the old Christmas had never been. As in water face answer-&#xD;
eth to face, so her soul responded to his. - Even in his love-&#xD;
making there 'had been no small nonsense, few caresses, less&#xD;
of sense and matter than of mind and soul; and, sitting op-&#xD;
posite the only woman he had ever desired to have for his'wife,&#xD;
he was an interesting companion, listening as well as talking,&#xD;
bringing out her best points by his natural comprehension and&#xD;
appreciation of them.&#xD;
"Lift that wing a trifle, Sapho ! 'tis a noble creature, is it&#xD;
not?  Did-you ever hear of the Aurelian,-who fell in love with&#xD;
this Camilla's graceful elegance ; and long after he was too in-&#xD;
firm to follow her airy flights, he used to haunt the woods and&#xD;
sit and watch, and feast his eyes upon her inimitable evolu-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"It seems a pity that these gorgeous beauties have no voice;&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. OTHO GROENVELDT BIDES HIS TIME. 419-&#xD;
the sweet dew of the honey-suckles they sip should make them&#xD;
sing."&#xD;
"It may be that the lack is not in the Papilio, but for want&#xD;
of Fine ears' power to hear ;' the fairies go often to butterfly&#xD;
concerts, where the cicada beats the drum, the bumble bee&#xD;
takes the horn, and the firefly furnishes the illumination. Ah!&#xD;
Sapho, I dare say you would like 'the trees to grow by music&#xD;
and the brooks to murmur articulate.' There is water runneth&#xD;
by the mill that the miller wots'not of. You must also feed on.&#xD;
honey-dew before you get Fine ears' gift. Tlhat is a marvel-&#xD;
lously pretty tale of the 'singing flower,' a Christian knight&#xD;
tells us, and approves the truth, of what he says by his sacred&#xD;
word, and that he himself heard the song 'in calm summer&#xD;
evenings and the stillness of nature.' A pure melodious voice,&#xD;
whose notes went up toward heaven, would suddenly vibrate&#xD;
on the ear. It was the mandragora which thus chanted its&#xD;
nocturnal strains ; those who heard it felt emotions they could&#xD;
not express. Their hearts beat with pleasing violence, and&#xD;
tears of tenderness suffused their eyes. Sometimes the night-&#xD;
ingale endeavored to vie with the mandragora. But soon&#xD;
the charm would act upon herself; her trills would gradually&#xD;
become tamer, her voice would grow weak ; till. at length she&#xD;
would cease, and only listen to her triumphant rival.".&#xD;
The voice of the mandragora brought good fortune to those&#xD;
whose ears it had once entered; ever after they heard it resound-&#xD;
ing from the depths .of their souls. It was poetry that had&#xD;
spoken to -them. " Now I think. I'll have .Belisama next this&#xD;
Marsyas, though they've no business to be nearer neighbors&#xD;
than Brazil and Java. Yet the gorgeous scarlet, perfect cerise&#xD;
color (who was it called a cherry "fragrance and flavor done&#xD;
up in a red' wrapper"), looks vell beside the- ciel azure; 'tis as&#xD;
deep and intense as Sonsie's eyes, is it not ? Did youi know&#xD;

the curious fact that most of the mountain peoples of the world&#xD;
are blue-eyed?"&#xD;
After a little silence, Chris uttered a thought she had been&#xD;
turning over.- "Is it not passing strange-that the great natural-&#xD;
ists and the . lords of science are so. many of them infidels.&#xD;
Nature- shows them her choicest mysteries, and yet they live&#xD;
and die with no divine Creator in their creed, but refer all'&#xD;
things to second causes. One would think a study of this yellow&#xD;
moth, for instance,. its pretty phimes, nicely balanced wings, and&#xD;
delicate coloring, would force them to own it must have a Crea-&#xD;
tor.. I had a Luna come out last week, and I lay awake all&#xD;
night to see it grow. At first the wings were mere specks, and&#xD;
interfolded, and the body was immense,; and I watched it inject&#xD;
the juices through their clear cells till they spread and spread,&#xD;
and grew green and lengthened, and the body shrank and les-&#xD;
sened; and at two o'clock I had a marvellous specimen, a great&#xD;
beautiful gossamer Luna, , flapping. its wings against its old&#xD;
prisonrhouse. Only a Deitycould produce a butterfly, and yet&#xD;
these great men, who know all about it, are content with second&#xD;
causes. ' Prepare to meet thy God ' has no significance to&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"Ah, Sapho.! God is love."&#xD;
Chris liked up. Though the speaker's face was pleasantly&#xD;
grave, his voice had a ring in it, and his eyes smiled into hers&#xD;
with their old kinlding sweetness. " The world has many fear-i&#xD;
less thinkers, and of course some of them get dreadfully mud-&#xD;
4e4 - our theology is not standing still. There is.no harm in&#xD;
stirring it up and sifting it ; and though there are some points&#xD;
beyond our reasoning, we have a right to study, to search.&#xD;
I don't know how a thinking soul can fail to find its God, and&#xD;
I cannot understandl how a loving one can bear to live without&#xD;
its Christ, and everybody as hoping for a heaven. What that&#xD;

shall be we know not yet. 'Gates Ajar' is a bold book ; but&#xD;
Coleridge out-said it years ago, when he told Charley Lamb&#xD;
that there be persons who place the whole angelical beatitude&#xD;
in the possession of a pair of -wings, to flap about with, like a&#xD;
sort of celestial poultry. Apropos to angels,Sapho, do you know&#xD;
what designs Zoe has upon us two? She wishes to drag us in&#xD;
triumph at her chariot-wheels. She will have us for bridesmaid&#xD;
and man."&#xD;
Chris started and blushed. Like the ancient mariner, he&#xD;
had a spell in his full, flowing voice, which would hold her fast.&#xD;
It was glorious music, the echoes of its olden tones were still&#xD;
sounding in the chambers of her soul. She looked at him and&#xD;
wondered what it was about this grave, imperious, proud man-&#xD;
hood, which so charmed and delighted and satisfied her ; but as&#xD;
he was waiting a reply, she stammered,&#xD;
"Yes sir ! Zoe asked me to be one of her train of maidens,&#xD;
but she did not name my companion."&#xD;
" Of course you understood that I must be the man."',&#xD;
Here it came again! The feeling of irritation at his masterful&#xD;
appropriation of her, to mar her pleasure in him; and she replied,&#xD;
quietly, -&#xD;
" I did not indeed ! nor do I even now see the sequence ;&#xD;
in truth,'when she pressed me to come she did not know what&#xD;
spot on the footstool you were pleased to glorify with your&#xD;
sublime presence."&#xD;
"Indeed !" (provokingly). " There's a destiny which shapes&#xD;
our ends, rough-hew them as we may. Bill Shakes, the inspired&#xD;
friend of your handsome brother, never spoke truer words than&#xD;
those ! You see the mine could not'swallow me up, nor the&#xD;
lovely land retain me when I was needed-here, and I am the&#xD;

dark, not knowing whether they shall alight amid flowery&#xD;
meads, or make dismal wreck among bristling rocks. But since&#xD;
Sapho approves, I shall don bridal favors, and walk proudly with&#xD;
her on my right arm, clothed in white, the cynosure of all eyes,&#xD;
the observed of all observers."&#xD;
Christabel did not know how to answer when Mr. Groen&#xD;
veldt chose to talk in such bantering strain, and she went on&#xD;
dipping her brush, and fastening beetle's wings in rosy silence.&#xD;
" Do you find my friend Max a sprightly correspondent,&#xD;
Sapho?" asked he, quietly, dusting a fresh case.&#xD;
"No, sir," she replied, looking quickly up, and unconsciously&#xD;
fingering the sapphires which spanned her wrist.-&#xD;
"A most naive confession, and not flattering to the yellow.&#xD;
haired count. And, by the way, is that a talisman, that your&#xD;
fingers fly to it so often ?"&#xD;
He waited for an answer, but nothing except panting breath&#xD;
came through her partedlips.&#xD;
" Thus 'I commence my new labor, I pray you commend&#xD;
my skill; the soft leafy-green dodo for my centre ; that is&#xD;
comely. It may be that your bracelet is fellow to the wondrous&#xD;
jewel the Koran tells us Abraham wore around his neck, the&#xD;
light of which raised up the bowed down and healed the sick,&#xD;
and after his death was placed among the stars. Yon royal&#xD;
yellow fellow next, yellow in color, is bitter in taste; so&#xD;
botanists tell us, but it sets off the violet of our purple Midam-&#xD;
iras, as the two contrast in the petals of your favorite flower.&#xD;
Do you remember the odd brooch we saw at Ball &amp;amp; Black's,'&#xD;
Sapho?"&#xD;
" Yes, sir," replied Chris, absently, "I think I do." She had&#xD;
laid down her brush, and was dreaming, with her fingers on the&#xD;
table, and studying carefully their evolutions.  "Yes, indeed,&#xD;

prey, a magnificent Papilio Asteria , who flies just before theinm;&#xD;
they rush on, artd he settles on a low bush, and Dick seizes&#xD;
him and tears his plumy wings, and Gracie is sorely grieved,&#xD;
and weeps-- I'll write it out this evening, and I'll have for my&#xD;
motto 'Wordsworth's sonnet to his sister.' My sister Emme-&#xD;
line and I," etc.                            -&#xD;
" What are you planning, most versatile Sapho ?- do you ned-&#xD;
itate a sonata to add to your Lesbian productions?",&#xD;
He stopped his work to watch her, and through the half-&#xD;
teazing, half-inquiring tone of his question there ran a 'sub-cur-&#xD;
rent of eager pleasure, which seemed like pride in the young&#xD;
creature he was studying so closely.&#xD;
"No, sir," she replied, quietly, resuming her work, "only a&#xD;
fantasia. You managed somehow to bring to my mind that but-&#xD;
terfly chase of Wordsworth, and I intend to try to write a&#xD;
piece of music to it. I believe I can do it."&#xD;
"I have not a doubt of it, Sapho, and when you have it com-&#xD;
plete, I'll take it to Huntington, and have it gotten out in good&#xD;
shape, and we will play it together."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," Chris answered; but all the while she felt&#xD;
the same unrestful trouble to mar her enjoyment.&#xD;
"Revenons a moutons, Miss Chris. I spoke of a certain&#xD;
pansy brooch, which Miss Brandon desired Uncle Alec to pur-&#xD;
chase for you; very thoughtful, was she not, and exceeding&#xD;
kind?"&#xD;
"Thoughtful! the fewer thoughts she bestows upon me the&#xD;
better I shall - be suited, and as, for her desires! they are of&#xD;
less account to me than the spider's most attenuated web," re-&#xD;
plied Chris, with curling lip.&#xD;

must admi~t that she is strikingly handsome."&#xD;

"I am told that men believe all women are spiteful toward&#xD;
each other, and I dare say it will sound like it when I tell you&#xD;
that Belle Brandon is not pretty to me, because I cannot look&#xD;
in her face without being unpleasantly reminded of dangerous,&#xD;
or creeping things, and her floating, gliding motions are a pres-&#xD;
ence wonderfully graceful, but somehow they always suggest&#xD;
Geraldine, and Lamia. I am   afraid I must confess to a&#xD;
thorough dislike to her, a dislike grounded upon excellent&#xD;
reasons."&#xD;
"That is no news to me, you transparent pensee. I must&#xD;
read you a lecture upon the charity that believeth all things,&#xD;
suffereth long and is kind, doth not behave itself unseemly.&#xD;
What chance, think you, a young or an old fellow would have&#xD;
of domestic bliss, or of ruling himself, mated with her. The&#xD;
gray-mare the better horse, hey, Sapho !"&#xD;
Chris looked at him, and at the golden lizard he was holding&#xD;
up in its tiny phial, between his eyes and the sunshine, and she&#xD;
felt sure his thoughts pointed in the same direction with those&#xD;
of faithful Deborah ; and now came out one of the oddities in&#xD;
her which Otho especially liked : she left the subject for a side&#xD;
issue, and avoided giving an opinion.&#xD;
"That current saying, sir, refers. to the fact that in old times&#xD;
the gray mares of Flanders were preferred to the finest coach-&#xD;
horses of England, even as those of the Kocklamii are reckoned&#xD;
priceless.by their Arab masters, after a successful endurance of&#xD;
their one terrible trial, - a race of forty or sixty miles, without&#xD;
respite, and a deep-water swim afterwards; then, if the 'animal&#xD;
comes Qut strong, and takes her food with healthy appetite,&#xD;
she is counted worthy of all tenderness, and absolute worship."&#xD;
Otho smiled while she proceeded to relate the horse-anec-&#xD;
dotes she had picked up, no one knew where, -the docility,&#xD;
sagacity, faithfulness of the race, and the wonderful feats of&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. OTIZO GROENVELD      BIDES HIS TIME.     425&#xD;
remarkable steeds, and he thought how, sometimes, one terrible&#xD;
ordeal in a human life proves the value of it, and develops hid-&#xD;
den powers in the soul, and rounds and establishes the charac-&#xD;
ter. And who can tell whether the proud man felt any sorrow&#xD;
for the bitter suffering his love had endured, when he found&#xD;
her so pgarly perfect in all she aforetime lacked. One thing&#xD;
certain, he counted her worthy of all tenderness,.if not absolute&#xD;
worship.&#xD;
"Thanks, Sapho! Learned also in horse-flesh, as-well as&#xD;
poetry. But now, if you have sufficiently exhausted your sub-&#xD;
ject, you shall tell me why                 iend Max's&#xD;
letters."&#xD;
Chris flamed up under his provoking side-ht, and wished&#xD;
shy had held her tongue, and she replied, quietly,-- -&#xD;
" I can form no opinion whatever of his -epistolary powers,&#xD;
because I have never read any letters of his."&#xD;
"Nor written any either for his perusal ?" asked Otho,&#xD;
looking in her face.&#xD;
"No, sir; though I can imagine no.reason for your inquiry,&#xD;
and do not recognize your right to make it, still I don't mind&#xD;
telling you Dr. Max is no. correspondent of mine, nor ever&#xD;
was."&#xD;
"That is strange, now; because I saw an epistle in Miss&#xD;
Brandon's hand this morning; which I could have sworn was of&#xD;
your graphy, and it was directed to Count Max. She stood by&#xD;
the hall table, turning over the letters, and she picked it up,&#xD;
and remarked upon the beauty of 'our Chris's penmanship.'&#xD;
There, my good helper! many thanks; the last of Lepidoptera&#xD;
is placed, and our task is finished."&#xD;
Chris felt a sense of danger, as if there shad been a deadly&#xD;
reptile -in her neighborhood, and she thought, "What can&#xD;
the plot bet? What does she know of Max or his bracelet,&#xD;

seeing that I never mentioned him to her, or indeed to&#xD;
anybody."&#xD;
Otho went on,&#xD;
"Max is a noble fellow. I am told that you sent him home&#xD;
happy, and that you await his return; that you prepare your.&#xD;
self in dainty needle-work, music, study, household Igge, to be&#xD;
a countess."  He smiled. "I know you are often with Debo.&#xD;
rah, and that your pretty fingers are never idle, and I learn&#xD;
that you are promised to my best friend. Is it true?"&#xD;
He was standing before her now, his hands free and quiet,&#xD;
his whole . trude superbly proud and confident.&#xD;
Chris      d. She saw that he was playing with her emo-&#xD;
tions, studying her, and enjoying the amusement and, though&#xD;
she resented the position, she could not help the conscious&#xD;
blood that surged through her cheeks, nor the "no" in her&#xD;
eyes. One swift glance conveyed it to him, and with a smile&#xD;
he captured it.&#xD;
"Ah ! that bracelet again, Sapho. You have worn it long&#xD;
enough,. in my judgment. You do not care for gauds; you&#xD;
told me so on the wall, and again in yonder little summer.&#xD;
house, St. Christabel's arbor. You shall come up thither with&#xD;
me this evening, after Zoe's frolic. Your eyes sought the lily-&#xD;
pads that day. I saw your- eyelids flicker as they do now.&#xD;
Come, change with me! Here are brooch and ear-rings of the&#xD;
same pattern. They were sent from beyond the sea, by a dear&#xD;
motherly friend, who used to call me her 'boy,'--sent for my&#xD;
wife. I have-sworn no other woman shall wear them. / I will&#xD;
not break my oath; but I will sell them to 'you for that spark-&#xD;
ling. circlet you are so fond of caressing with your pretty fingers.&#xD;
I know where you got the bauble, and why. I pity good,&#xD;
nobleMax. He did not understand your soul's history, or he&#xD;
would never have dreamed that you could transfer the love you&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. OTHO GROENVELDT BIDES HIS TIME.         427&#xD;
gave me to him. Such as you, recognize but one master. I&#xD;
had all your heart ; I have got it all now-! I'll be generous;&#xD;
keep your bracelet, and take also. my gems; his for friendship,&#xD;
mine for my wife."&#xD;
In spite" of his autocratical-bearing, his towering pride, his&#xD;
self-assumption, Christabel loved him. He spoke wisely.. Such&#xD;
as she love but once, and she owned it to herself while he&#xD;
talked. It grated upon her to have to own it, and it irritated&#xD;
her to feel how quietly he ignored all she had said to him; how&#xD;
he trampled over' her coldness: and reserve, and took her love&#xD;
fpr granted, and coolly appropriated her, as a master com-&#xD;
mands a slave. She rose in. anger, and pushed away t* gems&#xD;
he proffered, with such a provokingly serene air.&#xD;
"If I had forgotten -how you made me suffer, how. you&#xD;
looked at me, how you let others torture me, I might perhaps&#xD;
be foolish enough to listen to the promptings of the love you&#xD;
count on to subdue me to your yoke. I did love you. I do&#xD;
love you still; but I will not help myself to a tyrant, nor-you&#xD;
to the unquestioning machine you expect. The dogmatic dic-&#xD;
tum of the Church of Rome is not more cruel to her poor&#xD;
votaries than the speechless obedience you demand. I have&#xD;
too much common sense to be a good Catholic, and too much&#xD;
will, too much memory, to be Otho Groenveldt's wife.. No,&#xD;
sir ! every moment of that hateful time is ever present with me.&#xD;
You were hard and cruel then ; you re hard and cruel now."&#xD;
Bitter resentment clouded the tremulous light in her sweet&#xD;
eyes, and she hasted from his presence, uncertain of herself,&#xD;
and shut the door of her tower, and tried to ~collect her&#xD;
thoughts, and to comprehend the tumult of her soul.&#xD;
After the last fold-of her rosy-gray robe had trailed out of&#xD;
his sight, and her lst foot-fall had dropped into silence, Doctor&#xD;
Groenveldt restored the gems to his pocket. His face was&#xD;

clear, his manner absolute ; and he marched up and down,&#xD;
in his usual quiet, sedate fashion; and, though he did not put&#xD;
it into words, his thought, as he lighted his cigar, took the form&#xD;
of the ancient motto on the Boar's crest: "I bide my time."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
BELLE STUDIES THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS.&#xD;
HE four dined together. Otho sat opposite Chris,&#xD;
and addressed much of his conversation to her, trying&#xD;
to engage her in a discussion of some Barcarollos he&#xD;
proposed to sing with her; but though she replied, and even&#xD;
smiled, sometimes, her eyes looked pitiful, her lips drooped,&#xD;
and weary manner denoted suffering.&#xD;
Belle. Brandon was as soft and sweet as cream, coming&#xD;
home from her chateau en Esagne. She spoke little to her&#xD;
host, but she sat at the head of his table, and looked ra-&#xD;
diant. He often fixed his gaze upon her, and lost himself in&#xD;
thou}ht "  nd  t-  .           ....&#xD;
thought; and Belle ate as delicately as Aminie picked up her&#xD;
grains of rice at her husband's table, - the beautiful Aminie,&#xD;
vho was accustomed to go out at midnight to feast among her&#xD;
friends the ghouls, beside the opened grave.&#xD;
While the dessert was coming on, Chris bent her head over&#xD;
her lower-vase, inhaling its perfume, and she forgot to lift it&#xD;
even after Thomas was gone, and the door was shut.&#xD;
Belle watched her a moment.&#xD;
" Her lare blue eyes 'gan glitter bright,&#xD;
And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,"&#xD;
reached out her. plump little hand, and laughed.&#xD;
&#xD;
. "How oddly fate, or somebody, has dealt with us to-day'!&#xD;
Look ! I've got our Chris's pansies, instead of my lilacs [a&#xD;
lovely, shy glance at her host, which met its reward; for the&#xD;
dear old-fellow had yet youth enough to remember the lan-&#xD;
guage of the sweet, purple, old-fashioned blossom] ; and you,&#xD;
Chris, have gotten cinque-foil and lindens. Mr. Groenveldt is&#xD;
justly dealt with. See the narcissus, the white roses, sweet&#xD;
william, and wood-sorrel, twined about with bindweed, which&#xD;
salute him, and speak for him; and, oh, Mr.^Craigenfels, posi-&#xD;
tively Thomas is inspired; he has given: you ash-leaves= and&#xD;
oak, and fennel, to surround your one lily. Poetry, romance,&#xD;
autobiography, every thing! What is that Latin saying, Chtis-?&#xD;
Multa -multu, - come, be kind, and help me out."&#xD;
"Multurn in parvo, I suppose you want," replied Chris,-with-&#xD;
out looking at her.&#xD;
"Yes, dear learned child, I am sorry, but those dead.tongues&#xD;
never would slip readily off my lively one; and now, cherie,&#xD;
you shall play Mr. Interpreter to us good Christians, and read&#xD;
our posies for us.&#xD;
She folded her hands in gushing expectancy, while Uncle&#xD;
Alec complacently beamed from  one beautiful face to the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
"Yes, pet," said he; "Thomas has certainly, for 'some&#xD;
unfathomable reason, crucified his affections to-day, in that he&#xD;
has plucked the leaves from 'his most cherished delights, the&#xD;
lindens and - oaks he is dwarfing; Japanese fashion, and the&#xD;
longi forum he'has cut for me. Now you shall translate. them&#xD;
to us."&#xD;
Chris felt in no humor to comply, but as her kind old friend&#xD;
looked so pleased and expectant, she commenced.&#xD;
"You have oak-leaves, Uncle Alec; those mean hospitality;&#xD;

ash: those are greatness; fennel, strength; and lily, majesty-&#xD;
of a truth, a most delicate compliment."&#xD;
"And now for me," said - Otho, pushing his flower-vase&#xD;
toward her.&#xD;
"You are not flattered, sir. Narcissus, selfishness ; white&#xD;
rose, silence; sweet williams, scorn ; wood-sorrel, joy."&#xD;
Mr. Craigenfels and Belle clapped their hands and laughed.&#xD;
" Thank you, Miss Brandon," said Otho, with a queer look&#xD;
at-the blonde. " Did not the absent Chandy commend your in-&#xD;
dustry at one time?  If he were here, he might repeat the&#xD;
merited praise."&#xD;
" Oh dear," exclaimed Belle, suddenly, pushing up her loose&#xD;
sleeve, and pretending to search for a fly, or nothing at all,&#xD;
but bringing her creamy arm before Uncle Alec's gaze, set&#xD;
off by its simple band of black velvet, and she hoped he had&#xD;
made no note of the half-sneer beneath Otho's speech.&#xD;
" My simple posy needs no reader. We all know the lan-&#xD;
guage of pansies, and Chris better than any; and as for my&#xD;
fragrant hawthorn, I'll enjoy my hopes in secret, and mymusk-&#xD;
pinks -well, I don't mind, being childish so. long as I get&#xD;
loved-; but yours, -cherie; a curious mingling, truly ! First,~&#xD;
you've got lindens, conjugal affection-a little premature,&#xD;
perhaps, and to be taken in a i prospective sense -and&#xD;
lilacs, earliest love, is it not? ?.-Nay, mignone, do not blush so&#xD;
deep ; cinque-foil. Thomas has 'ranged the deep forest-dells,&#xD;
and brought back a. treasure of buds and bells,' and that&#xD;
means -you must help me, Flora, I'm all abroad."&#xD;
"Beloved daughter!" said Chris, speaking in a vibrating&#xD;
voice, and looking full in the blonde's face.&#xD;
There was an instant's painful silence, one of those pauses&#xD;
which startle like a sudden drum-beat, and then Otho took&#xD;
from his pocket a letter, and handed it across the table,-.&#xD;
&#xD;
« Is that yours, Miss Goldsmith?"&#xD;
Belle playfully snatched at the missive, and her eyes looked&#xD;
like Geraldine's, when she these words did, say,-&#xD;
"Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,&#xD;
This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow."&#xD;
"Let discretion pronounce, before giving it into the hands&#xD;
of innocence," said she.&#xD;
"Thank you; 'tis a foolish sheep that makes the wolf its&#xD;
confessor," answered Chris, quietly. She perceived at a glance&#xD;
that it was her writing, and knew from Otho's significant man-&#xD;
ner that this must be the letter he had spoken of in the cab-&#xD;
inet, and she greatly wondered what it would contain.&#xD;
"Me a naughty wolf! oh dear, Mr. Craigenfels ! Is- not&#xD;
cherie cruel ?"&#xD;
"If you intended this as a joke, Belle, I must request you to&#xD;
desist from all such pleasantries in the future," said Chris, fold-&#xD;
ing, and putting it into her pocket.. The blonde was a little&#xD;
nervous. She had no idea Otho would think, of detaining a&#xD;
letter from the post, and it looked dangerous. Still, he had no&#xD;
evidence of any sort, and she turned her swimming eyes be-&#xD;
seechinglyupon her host, who was quite troubled in his mind&#xD;
by this unmerited persecution and most unfeeling conduct on&#xD;
the part of his other guests,,to whom he resolved to speak pri-&#xD;
vately ; and the four sipped their coffee in silence.&#xD;
As soon as they rose from the table, Miss Brandon went up&#xD;
and slid her arm within Uncle Alec's, and said to the others,--&#xD;
"Come,-now, and I will give you some music."  She laid&#xD;
her hand upon Chris's, who twitched brusquely away.&#xD;
"I am going to the conservatory, thank you. I wish to&#xD;
compliment Thomas upon his dinner-posies."&#xD;
"I will accompany you, if I get permission," said Otho,&#xD;

walking off by her side. Belle heard and understood, but she&#xD;
did not even wink. ,.She conducted Uncle Alec to his easy-&#xD;
chair, brought his pipe of golden burnish, which it, had taken&#xD;
years of assiduous puffing to culotter into those glorious brown&#xD;
and yellow tints, which John Nicot did not live to see, that&#xD;
pioneer in the use of Buglos and Nicotiana. She struck a&#xD;
match, and stopped a moment, kneeling on the footstool at his&#xD;
feet, while she inhaled the divine perfume, and then she tripped&#xD;
merrily to the piano, and sang ; and what should. he do but&#xD;
listen, and look at her, and appetite beforehand a life with&#xD;
this wonderful creature, so richly gifted, so absolutely charm-&#xD;
ing. She knew how to give variety to her entertainment, also,&#xD;
for she .told him school-frolics, and how naughty Chandy&#xD;
made a sketch of his sister one day, and left it on her pi-&#xD;
ano, which, though kindly meant, of him, was almost cruel in&#xD;
its faithfulness ; and she floated up the staircase, and pretty&#xD;
soon. she floated down again, a little, out of breah, but very&#xD;
rosy, bearing the bit of card-board in her fingers, apd so pleas-&#xD;
antly did she tell the' tale, that Uncle Alec laughed a little&#xD;
before: he shook his head and said, " How cruel it was, and&#xD;
how wicked," adding that he could not have believed his hand-&#xD;
some boy would have been guilty of such a .deed ; and she&#xD;
was 'spitefully vexed that no undervaluing thought of "little-&#xD;
pet " had. been insinuated into his loyal mind; still, she did&#xD;
not despair.&#xD;

HOMAS'S face was a little sour, but he was glad to see&#xD;
his favorites, and he invitedthen. to cut some blooms,&#xD;
proffering his own, shears-; which was the most positWe&#xD;
mark of confidence and liking he knew.&#xD;
"What funny flowers you gave us, dear Thornas; to-day"&#xD;
said Chris. -"What ever possessed you F'&#xD;
" Possessed .me, Miss Chris I" V  the' gardener made a horrible&#xD;
face -" that blueteyed girl possessed me; she tormented worsen&#xD;
nor the legion of devils did them swine; she clipped all ny&#xD;
best things, knocked over my new Adonis-leaved Seneclo, and&#xD;
snapped up my fullest 'double Sedum with her long, tfrainiu'&#xD;
gown; a meddlesome, troubling' imp of Satan, as ever  plagued&#xD;
an old man. If she comes again, I'll hordes her -hout-quit&#xD;
as a cat can lick her ear."&#xD;
" So it was Miss Brandon who filled the vases, Thomas?"&#xD;
"Yes, it were," replied Thomas, throwing away a handful of&#xD;
cuttings, disgustedly, and spitting after them. ."I wouldn't a'&#xD;
let 'em stay a',table, only I had all my fuschias to pot, and=that&#xD;

This little episode somehow harmonized the odd relations&#xD;
between the two young people, who -looked at each other and&#xD;
smiled, and the doctor -said, as they left the conservator y&#xD;

fianced wife had left him. His cigar had gone out between&#xD;
his fingers; he was gazing at the carpet; brooding would be&#xD;
almost a proper word to describe his look and attitude, when&#xD;
Deb came in, somewhat fearfully, but still with the determina.&#xD;
tion of a strong purpose.&#xD;
"4Mr. Craigenfels, will you permit me to -tell you a short&#xD;
story?" said she.&#xD;
"Certainly, my good Deborah," replied he, rather astonished&#xD;
at the remarkable visit.  "Certainly. I am very glad, to see&#xD;

She refused to sit in his honored presence, but she proceeded&#xD;
to -tell thetale Chris had told, eating tartlets among her friends,&#xD;

sitting on Deb's knee. He heard her to the end, and took a&#xD;
long look at the sketch, which he had inspected once before&#xD;
that afternoon.&#xD;
"Deborah," said he, with dignity, "you are altogether mis-&#xD;
taken. Miss Chris also is mistaken. I shall take an early op-e&#xD;
portunity of speaking with her. on this subject. You are do-&#xD;
ing rank injustice to an innocent, artless girl; who is all warm-&#xD;
heartedness, and as transparent as crystal. I am astonished to&#xD;
perceive how everybody desires to malign and illtreat her. I&#xD;
am fully informed of the true history of this sketch. I know&#xD;

"Who told you, sir, if it be not too bold ?"&#xD;
"Vamiss Brandon herself," answered he, politely dismissing&#xD;
hs old servant, who put up her apron to her eyes, as she&#xD;
walked slowly back to her kitchen.  "Qr Lord 1" ejaculated&#xD;

CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
BELLE BRANDON'S LAST CARD.&#xD;
N unexpected visitor had arrived at Craigenfels, and&#xD;
was in close conversation with its master in the li-&#xD;
brary. Madame, having received a letter on the sub&#xD;
ject of the approaching marriage, and an invitation to assist at&#xD;
the celebration of the same, had hasted .to speak her mind,&#xD;
and so preceded her invitation a couple of days.&#xD;
Belle would gladly have prevented this bidding of an un-&#xD;
welcome guest, and she wasted. many gushing looks and&#xD;
flavored speeches to that end; but when she found it impossi-&#xD;
ble, she begged permission to write the letter, thinking it might&#xD;
get lost, perchance, in the trant, if carefully handled. This&#xD;
went for nothing, because U'ncl Alec sat by her, and waited&#xD;
till she had finished, and kissed he plump writer, and carried&#xD;
the missive himself to the post- so there was no help for it.&#xD;
Madame had got to come, and Belle must manage her. She&#xD;
had done it before, often and often, and did not despair of do.&#xD;
ing it this last time effectually. She had got a promise that no&#xD;
other guests should be invited till Thursday morning; and&#xD;
Thursday evening her position would be established, her wor-&#xD;

t urphantly. ,Sh had a brooch in the secret drawer of her&#xD;
writing-desk, and some whim impelled her to bring it out and&#xD;
try it one&#xD;
"Yes," said she, "with ferns in myhair," She heard footsteps&#xD;
in. dhe passage, and though her - door was bolted, and no one&#xD;
could enter without her leave, she hurriedly displaced it, and&#xD;
thrust it into her,-pocket, with ,her point handkerchief, while&#xD;
she listened intently. . Then she .settled a loose bud of her&#xD;
delicate wreath more to her liking, tossed off her blonde hair,&#xD;
and stepped out into tie hall. Deborah was passing, her arms&#xD;
"-piled with Chris's washing. She observed the fluting and the&#xD;
cleargtarching of the. pretty aprons and things. Deb wouldn't&#xD;
iron  er clothes,-but left them to the laundress ; and Deb&#xD;
scoledaon her, glidingalong.&#xD;
"Where is your master?" said she, haughtily.&#xD;
A darker frown and angry grunt were all she got for answer.&#xD;
"Your time is short,, my .dear I" said. Belle, between her&#xD;
teeth asshe followed the retreating form of the faithful old&#xD;
serent, with her Geraldine eyes; "We'll soon make an end of&#xD;
your a.''s and nonsense."&#xD;
Shegave her dress a finishing pat, and adjusted her face to&#xD;
dimpled joy, before she turned the knob of the library door,&#xD;
andwith her handsome 'head daintily poised, and her glorious&#xD;
chains displayed, she entered.. She was so wondrously, mag-&#xD;
niicently beautiful, that all eyes rested on her, and all tongues&#xD;
kept silence, as she floated gracefully on.&#xD;

with a determined shutting . of her plump hand, and quick&#xD;
steps, which brought her between them and him, so that she&#xD;
stood directly before him, and his eyes drank in her loveliness.&#xD;
He rose, took -both her hands in his, and drew her to the win-&#xD;
dow, she stepping proudly by his side.&#xD;
"Mi a Tortolita treciosa," said he, in a- low voice, while he&#xD;
questioned the eyes lifted trustingly to his, "they have been&#xD;
speaking- evil words of you,' which' I do not wish 5t bdeE;&#xD;
and now that I look at you, I feel more than 'ever certain that&#xD;
they are wrong, and you shall tell them so."&#xD;
"Oh, thank you, sir," she answered, clinging to him; "that&#xD;
dread woman makes me tremble. I suffered so much'while I&#xD;
was in her power ; but you are near me now. You love me.&#xD;
You will not let her hurt me, or-be cross, will you?"&#xD;
"Cross I oh no, mia' Bella:; butl hate to repeat what they&#xD;
sa. Do you know they would fain persuade ne that you are&#xD;
promised to. that young Spaniard. If it is true, 'it is not yet too&#xD;
late. I'll release, and forgive you; and, darling, even if they&#xD;
speak falsely,711 make you rich, and I will be your friend,&#xD;
your papa."- He smiled,  he was so sure of her truth. How&#xD;
could he doubt, with those creamy hands in his, those 'lovely&#xD;
lips, and dimples, and 'curls, and those shoulders, beneath his&#xD;
gaze ?&#xD;
Belle for one instant thought, "Rich and free I but no; the&#xD;
whole is better than 'a part. I'll have it all!'' and her' eyes&#xD;
swam in tears; one great pearl 'dropped upon his hand.&#xD;
"You torture me, sir ! you are cruel, even to speak of such&#xD;
a thing. I have put to the blush my maiden modesty, 'to tell&#xD;
you how entirely I ni yours; how- you captured my poor little&#xD;
heart. A simple heart it is  no image in it but yours -h&#xD;

Madame commenced under; rather discouraging circumstan-&#xD;
ces, and her important queries lost something of their dignified&#xD;
effect, from the.fact that she was obliged to look the&#xD;
smiling culprit, whoe was occupied in beaming h  eliest&#xD;
upon the gentleman upon whom she leaned. With steadf4oice&#xD;
and undisturbed mnien, she denied' the whole. " As: to the&#xD;
sketch, you know, I have already given you its history, and&#xD;
Christabel herself will say she needed and profited "by the sal.&#xD;

Uncle Alec believed every word she uttered, and seeing Deb&#xD;
at the door with a couple of letters, he walked pleasantly to&#xD;
meet her. He was habitually polite to old Deborah, as well as&#xD;
all his servants, who aadored' him, and he felt especially 'benev-&#xD;

"Two, Debby," said he, "and in an unknown hand. I did&#xD;
not know I had a correspondent who dealt so largely in quirks&#xD;

before, she convulsively grasped it, and. her cheek got a shade&#xD;
paler, but she stood quite still, not turning aside ; she kept her&#xD;
face in good order, till she had perused it to the end.&#xD;
"Poor, silly fellow; he is quite beside- himself. I should&#xD;
have been afraid once to get such a letter, but I know I have&#xD;

She had quite overdone her last epistle, and her lover was&#xD;
speed g on the wings of love: to clasp his impassioned mistress&#xD;
i1 his arms. But a little time ! only a little more time! that&#xD;
was what she needed now. 'Uncle Alec was perusing his con-&#xD;
nication, and she waited till he should finish it, and look at&#xD;
hertg.begin anew. She threw a sharp glance at the paper.&#xD;
If she could but know the tenor of his letter, she would be able&#xD;
to proceed more safely; but she must:trust to chance for find.&#xD;

Simple truth ! bewitching -innocence l She, looked the im-&#xD;
personation of modest virtue, and while Uncle Alec began too&#xD;
clearly to see that he could not have her for his treasure, he&#xD;
longed to take her in' his arms, and shield her fromthegaze of&#xD;
those who were looking disgust, anger, horror, at her..&#xD;
We are told that. the angels were hurled out of heaven.. They&#xD;
had been well-beloved up to that time. Is not love eternal?&#xD;
The library door opened wide, and Sonsie Eagan announced&#xD;
visitors. "1Mr..Blair and his wife, Mr.Craigenfels," said she, all.&#xD;
gladness.&#xD;
"Yes, here we are, sir, duck and I," spoke up the giant, in&#xD;
his rich, cherry voice. "We know who we are now. We know&#xD;
all about every thing., She's sweeter than- ever, isn't she, my&#xD;
dear, good Ruthie?"&#xD;
Sonsie went up to Chris, her face glowing. "Is it not beau-&#xD;
tiful to see the bonnie pair of them together once mmore ?"&#xD;
Belle could not help dropping into a chair behind, the great&#xD;
embroidered fire-screen, and a. pang shot through her heart&#xD;
This was the only man who had ever had power to quicken her&#xD;
pulses, or make her dream. She fully believed that he did love&#xD;
her, and her Geraldine eyes deepened to, glitteringsteel while&#xD;

thought, she had time, in-three or four steps she ma4e, to think&#xD;
how she ,could rejoice to belong to the handsome athlete, and&#xD;
to feel bitter spite at the fate which had withheld from her&#xD;
wealth, with such a demigod:&#xD;
"Ah, 'dear Mr. Blair'! old friend! please keep one a little&#xD;
sm ie  oie Jhand-shlake for me. is not this the crowning of&#xD;
all pleasures, to meet you?? I assure you, Roaring River was&#xD;
very insigificant-without your magnificent presence."&#xD;
'eorgestepped back, and drew Ruth closer to him. "Do&#xD;
not look at' her, Ruth; do' not 'touch her.! Mr. Craigenfels, you&#xD;
have oft awalking falsehood here. - Be careful I entreat~you-&#xD;
Come away, deatest; you shall not' breathe the same'air with&#xD;
her ! no, not for one moment. I'l visit you afterwards sir!&#xD;
When you've your house purfied and exorcised."&#xD;
How 'do you suppose Ruth felt--her secret carefully guarded,&#xD;
no seret at tall fto'her grand; 'noble husband, -who had refrained&#xD;
from touching what he saw she wished to hide? -I'l .tell you&#xD;

door through which he had departed, and made a i'step as&#xD;
though she would fly and hide -herself. The light around her&#xD;
became throbbing darkness. She: threw up her beautiful arms,&#xD;
and gasped, 'and fell. 'For the first time in her miserale life,&#xD;
she lost control of her body in the presence-of others, 'andshe&#xD;
lay prone upon the floor before them all. Her long lashes&#xD;
dropped upon: her cheek, herblonde: curls swept back frorn her&#xD;
fair face, and her lips parted so as to show her shdp little teeth.&#xD;
Never had the absolute' perfection of her maidenhood :beensso&#xD;
apparent, as when the lovely casket' lay forsaken by its schem.&#xD;
ing soul. If she had planned it beforehand7 she could not 'have&#xD;
chosen a more graceful pose. Like a tired child-one round&#xD;
arm beneath her head -the other hand grasping the letter, and&#xD;
the rich folds' of the 'costly' satin, whose sheen enveloped-her.&#xD;
It was not till she opened her 'eyes that zyou saw the lurking&#xD;
devil, shameless, determined=; and the sleeping angelfwastrans-&#xD;
formed into a watchful demon.- So sudden was the change,&#xD;
that those about her drew quick breaths, and started back; and&#xD;
questioned each others faces.&#xD;

Deb picked it up, holding it near and far, looking by turns,&#xD;
at it and Sonsie.&#xD;
"'Tis Gospel truth, Mr. Craigenfels! The thief of the world!&#xD;
She'd got the girl's fairing in her pocket"&#xD;
Whether Belle had borrowed the pin, intending to replace&#xD;
it, or not, I cannot tell; but there it was, to witness against&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"And, goodness gracious, Miss Chris! come and look,&#xD;
please. Either my old eyes deceive me, or here's Miss Alec's&#xD;
lace that I gave to you when you goed to school. Oh, law !&#xD;
what'll happen next ? Well, well!"t&#xD;
Belle, coming to herself, fixed her eyes upon Uncle Alec,&#xD;
who stood a little way off, gazing sorrowfully at her. After a&#xD;
hasty survey of those around her, she rose a little dizzily, and&#xD;
fought for possession of herself; shook her robes slightly into&#xD;
place, and went straight up to him with beseeching gesture.&#xD;
"Do not cast me off,sir. It was, at the most, but a flirta..&#xD;
tion.  I've done flirting .now I  Your wife will, be always&#xD;
discreet."&#xD;
He looked sorrowfully at her, and covered his face with his&#xD;
hand,. while a little shudder crept over him.-&#xD;
Take-her- away," said he, very gently. "Poor child!&#xD;
Such loveliness and such depravity ! Unfortunate girl !"&#xD;
Belle saw.here hopes in that quarter dashed to the ground,&#xD;
and she wheeled royally about, and' faced them' all, and&#xD;
laughed.&#xD;
"'Well; good tpeople,,though it is no particular business of&#xD;

"Mia Bella1 in. gorgeous array ! And is it in my honor&#xD;

"Is this true ?" said he, in a fierce whisper; and the trou-&#xD;
bled, anxious -eyes resting sorrowfully upon her answered, even&#xD;
before Madame spoke -&#xD;
"Yes, my poor Henriquez, it is shamefully true, and you&#xD;
must rejoice that you did not sacrifice your brilliant life to that&#xD;
wretched girl, who has been busily plotting to marry my brother&#xD;
while she was betrothed to you ; and she had the-audacity to&#xD;
say not five minutes ago that she would take you as-a last re-&#xD;
sort, though you were not so rich as the man who has just cast&#xD;
her off."&#xD;
"What does this mean, sir?"&#xD;
Zambrano spoke through his clinched teeth, madly wishing&#xD;
to pick a quarrel with somebody upon whom. 'he could wreak&#xD;
his anger. Poor boy!. It was a sad trial, and his hot temper&#xD;
had not learned how to bear crosses in quiet.&#xD;
Uncle Alec got up and went over and took the youth's hand&#xD;
in his, and-shook it softly.&#xD;
" It means, my dear fellow, that you and I have both been&#xD;
fooled to the top of our bent by a heartless flirt, that's all !"&#xD;
Zambrano couldt not bear the tone sof the speech,' half-ban-&#xD;
tering, half  , and appealed to his treacherous adored.&#xD;
"Speak; (lle l" exclaimed he, passionately. "Say they are&#xD;
all liars!"&#xD;

touched his hand*&#xD;
"I'l explain hereafter; dearest," she whispered. "These&#xD;

the rose.  And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and&#xD;
come up to Zion, with songs and everlasting joy upon their&#xD;
heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and&#xD;
sighing shall flee away."&#xD;
Mr. Growing smiled to himself at his thoughts, as the Doctor&#xD;
progressed, and was a little vexed too, he having to preach the&#xD;
following Sunday, and, of course, intending to give a sermon&#xD;
bearing on the new church, had inquired of the reverend gen-&#xD;
tleman, -&#xD;
" What text have you chosen for your dedication discourse,&#xD;
sir !"&#xD;
"You will-know when you hear it," was the concise reply.&#xD;
Mr. Growing was very nearly as absent-minded as Ao to,&#xD;
who, we are told, once walked in slippers all the way fron Ca.&#xD;
pri to Ferrara because he happened to stroll out of doors in&#xD;
that direction ; and, he perpetrated querities enough, while&#xD;
thinking Up-his sermon, to keep his chubby sister, who was&#xD;
called Kate in the family, laughing from morning till night ; and&#xD;
her usual occupation of following after her brother, picking up&#xD;
his belongings, freshening his toilet, and searching missing arti-&#xD;
cles, which, as he said, "were forever falling down behind,"&#xD;
was extremely engrossing. One ,.morning, having taken off his&#xD;
beardie calmly dropped his best razor into the slop-jar, and&#xD;
turned the contents of his shaving cup into the drawer, left&#xD;
conveniently open, among his wife's best laces; ,and so, having&#xD;
completed that occupation decently andin order, he took his&#xD;
coalkhod-out to the pump in the yard, filled it laboriously with&#xD;
cold water, intending to replenish his study-fire,,and would in-'&#xD;
evitably have treated himself -to a small.flood, had not his&#xD;
laughing sister, who was- tripping after-him, stayed his hand in&#xD;
season.'hHe might have eaten paper and drank ink, for all the&#xD;
sense he had of the food he swallowed. He rose in the small&#xD;
&#xD;
hours, and in simple attire he paraded the floor, stopping occa-&#xD;
sionally to jot down a striking thought, which he afterwards&#xD;
dried carefully, squatting for the purpose beside a round object&#xD;
he conceived to be a register, but which -he afterwards identi-&#xD;
fied as an American article of plenishing called a spittoon.&#xD;
And now, the sermon, which was being so magnificently elabo-&#xD;
rated in his hearing, had the same text, and, of course, many&#xD;
similar thoughts. He well knew that he had ill-natured critics&#xD;
in his parish, who would gladly accuse him of plagiarism; but&#xD;
it could not be helped, and he decided, while he sat with folded&#xD;
arms and intent face, to preach his sermon precisely as he&#xD;
wrote. it. - He had put much labor upon it, - considered it a&#xD;
good discourse. He thought well of the child of his:brain, and&#xD;
he delivered it verbatim.&#xD;
Sabrina and Zoe worked faithfully.at the decorations, and their&#xD;
green-houses gave generously of .their treasures. Their zeal,&#xD;
was not without knowledge, for Zoe was to be married to red-&#xD;
cheeked Peter, dedication evening. The pulpit bouquets- were&#xD;
beautiful. The carved font Jan and young Bradshaw had in-'&#xD;
tended to present to the-society, but Captain Slocum took it&#xD;
out of their hands.&#xD;
"No, no, boys," said he, "that fountain business has recently&#xD;
come within my legitimate spear. I am going to bring forted&#xD;
my seven golden candlesticks, seven rams, seven lambs=there&#xD;
I go again ! I vum1I Inever open my clam-sheBl to say any&#xD;
thing about them youngones, butI train off-into Scriptur. Well,&#xD;
as I was sayin', Dulcet, she's going to have them seven-~rrit-&#xD;
ters / christened afore any'ether fOlks' babies are brought up;&#xD;
and so you may hold your horses,.for I shall just ;put my hand&#xD;
into my trousers-pocket, and pay the bill."'&#xD;

The church was -crowded, 'and brilliantly lighted ; double&#xD;

Mr .Hauxhurst said,, "for the mourners" --or wedding guests,&#xD;
he being one'of the{ chief.'L&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith went;'and sat in the corner. Her dress was&#xD;
stiff and black, and tshe huggedakgubrious. shawl around her&#xD;

herself, being a- long, way 6n the road ,to perfection since we&#xD;

&#xD;
been soon ended, so malignant, nay; deadly, was-the gaze which&#xD;
followed her to the altar.&#xD;
Mary Ann Nickson was there, ir costly bridal robes, looking&#xD;
pale and sad; and her husband,' though he diffused an atr os-&#xD;
phere of gin around' him, probably knew quite wellwhat he was&#xD;
doing, for he laid profane' hands on the necks and 'arms of all&#xD;
the girls he could cone at.&#xD;
Eye hath not seen, Ithink, a lovelier sight: thanthe proces-&#xD;
sion which swept up the aisle. Sabrina, a breathing violet, with&#xD;
Jan Vedder at her side-; then Christabel, in trailing:robes of rosy&#xD;
pearl, her curls-'of ,sun-touched chesnut - tucked behind her&#xD;
small ears, a bunch of deeph-hued pansies in her' simple snood,&#xD;
and on her' breast a 'like odorous -cluster fastened, with the&#xD;
curious brooch she just saw, and never forgot, when Uncle'&#xD;
Alec'bought the 'gifts for his nieces.&#xD;

him standing courteously waiting, expectant, certain, absolute,&#xD;
and talking pleasantly.S&#xD;
"#Thereis a neWstatue of you just discovered --a portrait,&#xD;
wrought out of marb  by an unknowns artist. I should like to&#xD;
take you to it, and ascertain fdr myself how much you -are to.&#xD;
day like, your old Lesbian self. Let me see!l those features are&#xD;
perfect Grecian, and the pos6 of the head and handling of lyre&#xD;
are wonderful for grace. She wears ear-rings, a necklace, ahd&#xD;
bracelet, and they are all exquisitely'chiselled."&#xD;
Her fingers trembled; she feared he was about to mention&#xD;
the gems "for Otho's wife," and she dropped her flowers. He&#xD;
picked them up, and restored them, and she made -haste to&#xD;
place them as she was desired, and to clasp above them the&#xD;
precious spray of glittering pansies,&#xD;
"Thanks, Sapho !" said he. " Quickly and prettily done !"&#xD;
And{then he threw in a little of the spice he was fond of using.&#xD;
in his talk with her, both to please some humors of his own, and&#xD;
for its visible effect upon-her. "It is said that the true name&#xD;
of your.flower comes from 'paonsee,' because of its resemblance&#xD;
to a peacock in shape and color, and that it is the vegiss mein&#xD;
nicht alone which has the power to give us thoughts ; but you&#xD;
and I, sweet Sapho, kno'W better than that; and may we never&#xD;
be so poor as to lack- our precious pansies, either here or in&#xD;
those celetia gardenswhere angels are the wardens.,&#xD;
The tremble andfiutter'of emotion his words awake ed still&#xD;
shineuered over her, while;she moved softly upthiroad aisle&#xD;
upon the_ arm of this "dominarit"oung man, whd walked&#xD;
proudlyadwas followed by Zoe and Peter.&#xD;
Thepeople, who know 1*it one way of doing things "the&#xD;
stereotyped folks - drew longbreats;androlled i ateir eyes,&#xD;
whe i they espied ponegran tes=anionghbride'sig bos-&#xD;
&#xD;
soms. Mrs. Walsingham herself had remonstrated, and laid the&#xD;
subject before Peter.&#xD;
" It is not seemly ! Nobody ever heard of such a proceed-&#xD;
ing ! and, besides, the language of that scarlet thing is foppery !&#xD;
That is what the pomegranate means !"&#xD;
"It means Zoe to me," said sturdy Peter, "and its language&#xD;
is perfection. Leave them alone;" and he got what he deserved,&#xD;
a good hearty kiss from  his glowing bride, for his decision.&#xD;
After the pair came Dick and Pauline. Here again the fault-&#xD;
finders had material for their vocation. This little couple were&#xD;
in the full dress of Washington's time -court-train, lace ruffles,&#xD;
powder, shoe-buckles, and all -and extremely handsome they&#xD;
looked, and eminently well pleased with each other. Pauline&#xD;
had insisted that Gracie should also have a dress, and walk in&#xD;
the party.&#xD;
"Why not?" asked she; "Dick's got two arms, and I can't&#xD;
use but one of them."  She was, after a long persuasion, ever-&#xD;
ruled by her little mother, and comforted with the promise of a&#xD;
fancy masquerade, where Gracie should shine resplendent.&#xD;
As soon as the marriage service was ended, the bridal party&#xD;
stepped back in a group around the flower-crowned font, and&#xD;
Mr. Growing placed himself beside it. Dulcet, who was to&#xD;
have the new organ till her place could be more artistically&#xD;
filled, and who had rendered the wedding march in remarkable&#xD;
style, came hastily down from the. choir, and soon reappeared&#xD;
from the minister's room, leaning*upon the captain's arm, and&#xD;
heading the procession of innocents,,or, as the captain kept&#xD;
whispering under his breath, "Seven golden candlesticks, seven&#xD;
lambs," etc.. The pale cripple held the hand of the oldest girl,&#xD;
and the others toddled after themiwthe fresh nurse bringing up&#xD;
the rear with the mite of humanity in her arms which Sonsie&#xD;

THE CHRISTENING OF THE SEVEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
deal of christening robe and very much cap left it to be in.&#xD;
ferred that a baby was hidden somewhere among their recesses.&#xD;
Dulcet had taken good care to have printed in clear type the&#xD;
names of rthe children, fearing that -the captain's truant tongue&#xD;
might run its favorite trip among the sevens. They were chris.&#xD;
tened in couples. The pale cripple had already sought and&#xD;
found:his patron saint, in her ,corner, and his soft, meditative&#xD;
eyes rested upon. her while Mr. Growing sealed him with her&#xD;
name. And then the little girl-"Virginia Marguerita Eglan.&#xD;
tina." Mr. Growing pronounced the words quite distinctly, and&#xD;
the assembled listeners looked at each other. Old Miss Petingill&#xD;
croaked under her breath like a. discontented frog: "Pecu-&#xD;
liar, how folks' can !"  When the next pair approached, and the&#xD;
sweet "Morris" -had been bestowed upon the pretty boy, and&#xD;
the pastor read from his list " Florabella Cassandrina Fenes-&#xD;
trella," he could not help the twinkle in his eyes; but when the&#xD;
third girl left the font, christened "Ludovica Clotildetta Jasa.&#xD;
minta," everybody laughed, and the young minister fixed his&#xD;
eyes upon the ground, and caressed his beard a moment, before&#xD;
he offered the concluding prayer. 'Dulcet had been too much&#xD;
engrossed in her anxieties, lest the seven should disgrace her&#xD;
by crying, to notice the grinning assembly, and though the cap.&#xD;
tain turned rather red,' he' stuck out'his foot, fifth position, and&#xD;
thus consoled himself.'&#xD;
"So long as my 'wife is suited I don't care a darn! Let 'erm&#xD;
laff"    '&#xD;
:And so the wedding and" the christening were over. Now&#xD;
occurred a curious phenomenon. Sonsie Eagan, who, though&#xD;
much urged, hid declined being among the guests - Sonsie&#xD;
watched; them with her brigptpblie eyesIas they passed out,&#xD;
and said' eyes filled with eat;,=all the while being fixed upon&#xD;
Sabrina Bradshaw-and Jan Vedder. A handsome couple they&#xD;
&#xD;
THE: CHRISTENING OF THE SEVEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
were, she thought, and very likely to stand before that altar&#xD;
some day, as centre figures, in just such a ceremony, they being&#xD;
the same in station, of 'the one kind, well-matched, and where&#xD;
would she -Sonsie Eagan --be then? And she experienced&#xD;
an angry pang as Jan stepped proudly along with Miss Brid-&#xD;
shaw on his arm. He had not once looked in her direction;&#xD;
did not even know she was there ! He was in gay holiday-face&#xD;
and exquisite dress, and carried himself handsomely. Sabrina&#xD;
looked well-pleased and very beautiful; and then Mrs. Vedder,&#xD;
who only a couple of days ago had called her "daughter,"&#xD;
flitted past in rustling silken robes, gleaming in jewels, quite&#xD;
different to the pleasant everyday lady she knew-her. Even&#xD;
her dear " white angel" was unconscious of her neighborhood,-&#xD;
"so near, and yet so far"-and she,,the Irish lassie, separated&#xD;
from them all, " across a gulf"-- coarse, rough, unskilled in the&#xD;
graceful acquirements which made them  so self-poised, so&#xD;
quietly, elegant. She had asserted the fact before ; it was no&#xD;
news to her. There was surely no call for the amazing discom-&#xD;
posure, or keen sense of outsideness, which pierced her through,&#xD;
as she walked slowly home, alone, her head bent.;. She fought&#xD;
it out, though, and entered the Horseshoe as bright and cheery&#xD;
as ever. While her brisk feet. patted over the floor she revolved&#xD;
her plans, andfixedly settled her energies among them.&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith stalked out of church, stiff and .grim, resolv-&#xD;
ing to put an .end tp all such wicked foolingg ad ifolderols&#xD;
--fetch home her girl, and put -her'through a course of sprouts,&#xD;
and take the kink out ofher"' Her eyes, as sharp as those-of&#xD;
which Proctor said "they looked as if they could pick up pins&#xD;
and needles" -(though, by the way, who could ever fancy d ar&#xD;

to make her talkf anyhow."-&#xD;
"Well, what d'ye think ont, Miss Goldsmith ?"&#xD;
"I don't think nothing' on't ! Why gaddest thou about so&#xD;
much to change thy way? 'For this, gird thyself with sackcloth,&#xD;
lament and howl. - Jeremiah ii. z6.'"&#xD;
Before she had completed her cheerful utterance she felt a&#xD;
nudge at her elbow, and a voice whispered, "Widder, widder,"&#xD;
and she turned a stony visage upon Esquire Hitchcock, who&#xD;
was winking at her.&#xD;
"You've got a lot of shares in the 'Sprightly,' I believe;&#xD;
haint you?"&#xD;
"What dye ask that question for?" snapped back the widow,&#xD;
setting her gums together for the ill news she saw in his fallen&#xD;
face.&#xD;
" Cause it's gone up ! busted ! that's all. Misery kinder loves&#xD;
company."&#xD;
"Then rny ten thousand dollars is lost!" muttered the old&#xD;
woman through her livid lips; "but it shan't come out of&#xD;
Qhandy's part. I'll fix it yet I Yonder thankless girl shall&#xD;
pinch and worry for it. See her flaunting and lippin, in her&#xD;
finery! I'll never pay a cent for themgewgaws ! never ! The&#xD;
fools that got 'em may look out for their money where they can,&#xD;
and she shan't go, off in that are kerrege, when her poor old&#xD;
mother, trudges afoot, no I" . The widow's eyes glared and&#xD;
rolled, and her face worked hideously, and one corner of her&#xD;
mouth twitched around towards her left ear and stopped there.&#xD;
I'll drag her out! I'll shame the godless creatur before them&#xD;
tall' slap herface! Here,  u good-for-nothing Christabel"&#xD;
She started to run after Fparty. "Cursed be ye all!&#xD;
for behold I will send e   scockatrices among you, that&#xD;
&#xD;
will not be charmed, and they shall bite you.' Stop that girl !&#xD;
Pull her out of them clothes, I tell you !"&#xD;
The crowd parted right and left, and gazed in silence after&#xD;
the black figure, with the working face and wild-glaring eyes,&#xD;
stumbling on into the darkness while the carriage rolled swiftly&#xD;
away.&#xD;

HE subdued noise and flutter of Zoe's reception were&#xD;
at their height. Uncle. Alec, with his Coleridge face,&#xD;
"round, ruddy, and unfurrowed as a holy friar's, and&#xD;
his flowing, silky beard - what a benign, smiling face we all&#xD;
knew it!" though something saddened to-day. -"What a com-&#xD;
fortable, respectable figure."&#xD;
Mr. Lankman, in swallow-tails and white kids; Mrs. Lank-&#xD;
man, in airy costume of sea-green, were the centre of a circle&#xD;
who discussed Christabel's new book. It had appeared a&#xD;
couple of days before in the book-stores, in plain brown bind-&#xD;
ing, and bearing the monogram of the Royal George upon its&#xD;
back, and as it was only a. booklet-three hundred pages or&#xD;
so - it had already been devoured by half the Roaring River-&#xD;
ites, who were ready to pronounce judgment upon it.. Mrs.&#xD;
Lankman sometimes did little. critiques when her worthy hus-&#xD;
band's duties crowded him. She never saw much good in any&#xD;
thing. The lily itself was scarcely white enough to please her,&#xD;
and somehow in perusing her       usions you had a vision&#xD;
of a pug nose turned up in as for her English, she&#xD;
had so strained it through th   of hypercriticisn that it&#xD;

&#xD;
ran as heavy as whale oil in winter, and the- edges and salient&#xD;
points of her conversation were polished into such glassy prim-&#xD;
ness, that' there wasn't left a peg to hang a thought uon.&#xD;
"It deals with no, great problems. The characters are pro.&#xD;
jected with no force: it is a breezy book' said Mrx Lankman,&#xD;
oracularly.&#xD;
"What do you mean by a breezy book?" asked Miss Brad-&#xD;
shaw.&#xD;
"He means, my charming young lady," said the sub-editor's&#xD;
wife (she had great respect forSabrina, as eldest daughter of a&#xD;
wealthy gentleman, whodroye fine horses, dressed elegantly,&#xD;
and spent money), "he means that this poor authoress has&#xD;
conmfitted the Very lantentabie error of putting improper lanJ&#xD;
guage i to then youths of her characters. Theirconversati6n is&#xD;
flaVored with slang--- the kind of slang whichis the ineffaceable&#xD;
stanip' of vulgar society."&#xD;
" Yes,-indeed, that's so,'' said Mrs. Pedlow. "Gentlemen&#xD;
do not talk that way in the presence of ladies."&#xD;
At this juncture Mr. Pedlow approached.,&#xD;
"God-evening, ladies. Quite-ashebang this, isn't it?' The&#xD;
bride coneth -up like a' flower,:doesn't she ? By -   I must&#xD;
get some of- these-peaches to take me up for a second smile.&#xD;
You and I had 'no !such"splendiferous fanfdango when we stood&#xD;
before the altar, Mrs. P. Oh, yes, the world is turning round."&#xD;
"I am inclined to think. that my estimable partner has taken&#xD;
a smile or so already," remarked Mr. Starbird, laughing.&#xD;
"I, for one, am quite surprised. I- knew Mrs. Goldsmith&#xD;
was vulgarly illiterate and mean, but still yI supposed her daugh-&#xD;
ter was to a degree educ   .Her book of course demon-&#xD;
strates that her habits o     nd expression are common&#xD;
and rudeor how cou           put such language into the&#xD;
mouths aFier-characters ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Starbird studied the sea-green lady, and :looked amused.&#xD;
" What a shocking vulgar fellow Dicken must be, upon your&#xD;
hypothesis. The language of some of his,. people is extremely&#xD;
unchoice; and Scott, he should be a swearing, roystering rol-&#xD;
licker ; and Mrs. Stowe, a down-east Yankee. .But we suppose&#xD;
Dickens to be a gentleman, Scott was :among England's peers,&#xD;
and we.know that the, dear womanly author of 'Pearl of Orr's&#xD;
Island' is a high-bred lady."&#xD;
Sabrinad:fixed smiling eyes upon Mr. Hauxhurst, who ques-&#xD;
tioned her for .her thoughts.&#xD;
"I was revolving a day spent'in Toptown lastweek, and&#xD;
wondering if .Kall the-people I met were vulgar, illiterate,&#xD;
slangy people.  They certainly looked like gentlefolks, and&#xD;
some of .them filledresponsible positions. For instance, .papa&#xD;
took me to a bank, where the grave, potent,, reverend seigniors&#xD;
communed together.&#xD;
"' Stocks have gone up higher than a kite."&#xD;
"' Yes, gold took a tumble yesterday.- The Pandam is dead&#xD;
lock, though.'&#xD;
"' I don't see that, You can't safely take stock in-Spriggins s&#xD;
stories. If you do, you will be up in a balloon before yoi&#xD;
know it.'&#xD;
"' Heigho ! I'm afraid we shan't any of us strike ile this year.'&#xD;
 " Two ladies were talking over a. pile of silks 'in the store.&#xD;
'I've been working at a thirty-horse power rate all the month,'&#xD;
said One. I looked in her face, and recognized a witty, distin-&#xD;
guished author, and I went and stood on a corner to wait for&#xD;
the street-car. ,A group of well-dressed, handsome American&#xD;

"'By Jove, I'm in the-same boat. Jordan is a hard road to&#xD;
travel. Who shall find us a remedy for this consumption of the&#xD;
purse ?'&#xD;
"Is that the sort of talk which bears the ineffaceable stamp&#xD;
of vulgar society, Mr. Lankman.? because, if it is, I know a&#xD;
good many magnates who are fearfully vulgar!4"&#xD;
"But, Miss-Bradshaw, waiving that objection, there is noth-&#xD;
ing new about this book --no startling thoughts, no deep-lying,&#xD;
far-reaching truths."&#xD;
Mr. 'Growing had been .listening, and spoke now for the&#xD;
first time.&#xD;
"Boileau tells us, sir, that wit and fine writing doth not con-&#xD;
sist so much in advancing things that are new, as in giving to&#xD;
things already known an agreeable turn, and, in my judgment,&#xD;
our dear young friend has admirably succeeded in precisely&#xD;
that. I, for one, sat up till three o'clock this morning to finish&#xD;
her charming story, and I feel better for its perusal. I hate&#xD;
wickedness, and desire purity and truth more- earnestly, and&#xD;
am altogether refreshed."&#xD;
"Give me force, strength, power," said Mr Lankman;&#xD;
"though, of course, it were .idle to expect all that from a&#xD;
woman. The female mind is not constituted to grasp great&#xD;
subjects, nor is it able to labor continuously."&#xD;
"You would 'heave up truth in spondees, and trundle it&#xD;
down in dactyls,'" said Mr. Growing, smiling.&#xD;
Captain Slocum being appealed.to, said characteristically, -&#xD;
"Well, friends, it is a darned sight easier to pick a volum&#xD;
to bits than to scratch one-together, and if any on you think&#xD;
you could do a story better th an this girl did hem, I advise you&#xD;
to set down and try it; and when you have turned out a sup.e-&#xD;

&#xD;
Their critical interview was rather ludicrously interrupted by&#xD;
Mr. Nickson, who came tugging up his unwilling papa-in-law,&#xD;
whom he held in durance vile, encircling his weazened little&#xD;
neck with both arms, while he plaintively and with tears pro-&#xD;
posed his favorite query again and again, desiring to inform&#xD;
himself why the deacon was the handsome lover of the capulet,&#xD;
to the intense amusement of the bystanders.&#xD;
"Nickson has been drinkin' ! " said Mrs. Esq. Hitchcock in&#xD;
the ear of her wedded lord.&#xD;
"What makes you think so?"&#xD;
"I know so. Why, what do you suppose the creatur up&#xD;
and done? I declare if he didn't take holt and kiss me.'&#xD;
" He must have been drunk, my dear-as drunk as a fool.&#xD;
No outsider, in his sane mind, would be guilty of that !" replied&#xD;
the Esq., in grim enjoyment of his own drollery.&#xD;
" He shall be dealt with for light conduct -cut off for guz-&#xD;
zling !" Mrs. Hitchcock asserted, very red in the face. "I'll&#xD;
bring him up."&#xD;
"We may not fellowship such a man, my dear; that's so, but&#xD;
we will keep quiet till we've settled Growing's hash. Mum's&#xD;
the word now."&#xD;
"Just hear that Nickson gabble-- do !" ejaculated old Miss&#xD;
Petingill. "I swon, he won't never fall down stairs for want&#xD;

Jan Vedder stood before the open window, thinking of a pair&#xD;
of damask "cheeks, and liups to match, and two eyes of Irish&#xD;
blue, which 'had looked merrily into his, while 'their owner par-&#xD;
ried with jokes arid-fun all his arguments to induce 'her to join&#xD;
the wedding party, and show herself 'at Zoe's reception; ard&#xD;
the difficulties in his hedged-up way seemed insurmountable.&#xD;
A quick, firm clasp of four supple fingers' upon his hand sent the&#xD;
blood galloping, and painted his cheeks with celestial rosy red.&#xD;
" Ah, Ollam  Folda the stubborn! 'Your 'Ere's curiosity&#xD;
made you to come and tike a peep after all, then V though your&#xD;
perverse wilfulness kept you from complying with "the' wishes&#xD;
of your best friends to appear here as guest, and you stupidly&#xD;
hid yourself up, like a- perverse little teaze, as you are, and&#xD;
thought I would not see you," began Jan.&#xD;
"Hush, Mr. Veddler, sir! Whisper," interrupted Sonsie,&#xD;
"till I tell you. The wider --she's down of a ethroke and&#xD;

no power to shelter her from sorrow, till we breik it gently to&#xD;

just worships her, for all his high ways. .Well, my dream is&#xD;
coming true - deep water, and trouble, and the: pale woman&#xD;
who beckoned me to take the plunge."&#xD;
Jan's horses were at the door, and not much time had&#xD;
passed before they stood by the paralyzed woman, stricken&#xD;
down in the heat of her anger and remorseless purpose. Her&#xD;
black eyes glittered, as they lighted upon the pale face of her&#xD;
white-robed daughter, with a hateful look, from which the poor&#xD;
girl shrank away shuddering, and hid her face in her hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
SON SIE GOES TO SCHOOL&#xD;
HE fifteenth of April was the commencement of the&#xD;
Rosenblom term, and Sabrina had got to leaveher&#xD;
friend Chris with her young heart full of trouble.&#xD;
Sonsie also, ruch as she desired to stop and 'help, was ordered&#xD;
to go. Fred's child was quiet and strong, and though she loved&#xD;
to feel the warm arms of the brave maiden around' her,, and to&#xD;
rest on her'courageous heart, she dismissed her to the work&#xD;
which she was panting to commence. The sympathetic Mile-&#xD;
sian's face was overclouded, and her eyes were wet, and so were&#xD;
her crimson cheeks, when she bade. her "white angel" "good-&#xD;
by," and her fervid speeches were as Irish as possible, and full&#xD;
of poetic imagery, and her heart throbbed with true love wd&#xD;
the tenderest pity. Her kind offices, however, had _heen out-&#xD;

Rainbow, following, her, had leaped to her shoulder, and looked&#xD;
down upon his prostrate foe. The paralytic's soul was alive&#xD;
and watchful, as her snapping eyes showed, and though her&#xD;
tongue was half dead, she managed it enough to - order them&#xD;
out, and she looked the broomsticks and pokers she could&#xD;
no longer wield; and Captain Slocum, who had been paying a&#xD;
visit of neighborly condolence, walked out with Sonsie.&#xD;
"Good day, my dear," said he, grinning. "You see the&#xD;
widder don't seem to hanker arter. your company. I'd. kinder&#xD;
save up my pearls, if I was you. Dulcet  she was hopin'&#xD;
you'd make time to look in on our seven golden -critters-&#xD;

laws. I've heard that Jan used to drink once in a while, but&#xD;

he's as straight as a string now. He told me he might have died&#xD;
in the gutter, if it hadn't been for a friend who took him by the&#xD;
hand just in the nick of time. [Sonsie's eyes deepened to rich-&#xD;
est violet, and her breast heaved]. He's as straight as a string&#xD;
now, though, and as healthy as a two-year-old colt, and as full&#xD;
of fun, and a regular team for business. Why, what do you&#xD;
s'pose I catched him and that bridegroom, Peter, adoin' last&#xD;

witty, brilliant things that brain of hers conceived, and how&#xD;
skilfully and entertainingly she brought them forth. Oh, yes,&#xD;
full of grace and richness everyday.".&#xD;
"I wish I could give you a dose of that water that Mr. Jan&#xD;

his large, fair hand, "but, I really loved the child."  He leaned&#xD;
backhand clasped his fingers behind his white head, and the&#xD;

that cunningest pattern of excelling nature, couldn't have been a&#xD;

I care in the least about that. I. wonder what will become of&#xD;

Roukie, she walked out of this room that dreadful' day, friend-&#xD;
less, with her handsome head up, and her face, beaming with&#xD;
defiant smiles. Oh Lord ! Oh Lord! Well, well, 'tis a pity-&#xD;
a fearful pity."&#xD;

Craigenfels, because I could not endure the familiar' sights, all&#xD;

didn't love me ; I love her  yet -; and though I was very&#xD;
wretched for a long while, I was young and it wore off; and&#xD;
my heart got light again,' but I am 'old now. I can't dream&#xD;
again of any home-joys or' home ties; but there was none of&#xD;

feel through this girl. My first love is a true, pure woman.&#xD;
Do you know, child f - of course it is terrible nonsense  but&#xD;
I hate the smell of those heliotropes. She never shook her&#xD;

the four lines it contained, directing her to give it to Missy&#xD;

As soon as she was alone (which was not, until she had&#xD;

&#xD;

an unclaimed waif, whom nobody owns, was not inspiriting&#xD;
but she had long before resolved to get all the flavor and relish&#xD;
out of her existence she could, coax or force it to yield, and she&#xD;
still meant to have it.  The crevices of the rocks were full of&#xD;
reindeer moss, and at her feet, behind the asclepias spikes' and&#xD;
last year's mullein stalks, were springing the tiny fronds of the&#xD;
sensitive fern, which she remembered shrinking from her touch&#xD;
that day; and she plucked some of the pale-green lichens,&#xD;
crimson-tipped cetaria, and fragile maiden's-hair and' bound&#xD;
them thoughtfully together.&#xD;
"Sapho !" said a well-known voice at her elbow, "I felt&#xD;
sure of finding you here, because I know you have never forgot-&#xD;
ten the day nor the place.  No other day in any of our years&#xD;
(Heaven grant that they may be many) can ever have precisely&#xD;
the color and flavor of'that 2oth of May. Those vivid fuchsias&#xD;
are gorgeous; Mr. Bradshaw's lawit is emerald velvet ; the&#xD;
sweet scent of the rosy-tinted apyle-blossoms is marvellous ; but&#xD;
that afternoon, when the crescent moon hung pale and clear&#xD;
right over there, and the crimson hammock swung from yonder&#xD;
tree, and Chris wore her sun-bonnet on her shoulders, and&#xD;
Pauline and Gracie danced' and laughed before her, was won-&#xD;
drous in its completeness. Do you suppose that little Alder-.&#xD;
ney has been croping the grass ever since ?  It seems that&#xD;
she dipped her creamy head in that very spot three hundred&#xD;
and sixty-five days ago. Here comes some fluttering petals&#xD;
from yon topmost'bough, falling like voiceless snow-flakes at&#xD;
her feet. The tree was covered with blooms that day. Nr-&#xD;
member, Captain Slocum told me, as I came up, that t&#xD;
had been a terrible blowth on the orchards, and the spring,&#xD;
which lingered then, and produced her treasures slowly, is&#xD;
speeding past us now with flying footeps. All the buds and&#xD;

 " THY PEOPLE SHALL BE MY PEOPLE."&#xD;
&#xD;
fallow deer lift their stately crests, and calmly "eye us over."&#xD;
I suppose they studied and admired us then. Ah, Sapho!I&#xD;
could look around, and imagine that I had but just listened to&#xD;
a sweet voice, which flows in musical cadence, reciting the&#xD;
'Cateral.' 'Tis only when I gaze in the Lesbian's face that&#xD;
I find change ; that shy child-life has blossomed into orbed&#xD;
maidenhood. Last year she was afraid to show me her eyes;&#xD;
to-day she is unwilling. Those mosses -please leave them in&#xD;
peace, and look at me. Come, dear, dearest Sapho ! You&#xD;
know me quite well now. You have seen me at my worst and&#xD;
best, and you love me just as I am -Ican make you happy.&#xD;
There walks not another man on the footstool who can ever&#xD;
be Otho Groenveldt to you. I believe, nay, I know, that God&#xD;
made this great self-willed fellow -:full of terrible faults, and&#xD;
also full of love and tenderness- to be the husband of Chris-&#xD;
tabel Goldsmith.&#xD;
He smiled joyously, and reached out his Mand. Chris had&#xD;
been looking at him as he desired, and her eyes filled with tears&#xD;
before he finished.&#xD;
"I hope so, indeed, Otho," she said, as she softly laid her&#xD;
little yielding fingers upon the strong, nervous ones, which&#xD;
clasped them instantly in spirit of ownership, and he noted and&#xD;
understood-her gentle sigh, half wearinesshalf content.&#xD;
" Bertha says I am a terrible tyrant.  You do not be-&#xD;
lieve it."&#xD;
"I kinow it thoroughly, Otho -nobody so well as I; but I&#xD;
am not afraid ; at least, not much. You must be as merciful&#xD;
a j~our haughty, imperious temper will let you, and I shall&#xD;
sometimes rebel - oftener submit."&#xD;
Nay, my darling, sweet Sapho, you shame me. If ever I&#xD;
feelminded to play' the tyrant, I'll remember the rare glimmer&#xD;
of your pretty eyes, their wistfulness, and their ,timid faith at&#xD;
&#xD;
this moment ; that will surely keep me in order, or I must be a&#xD;
monster indeed. I am sure'that love. is a vital principle, and I&#xD;
know it. is immortal, else mine for you must have died long&#xD;
ago. But fighting could not -subdue it, starving could not, kill&#xD;
it.' It conquers courage, defies manhood, and I am willing&#xD;
to be its obedient slave."&#xD;
"You set me a terrible lesson, Otho. I think I learned it so&#xD;
faithfully, that it will serve me for a lifetime."&#xD;
"I also got a lesson, I believe," he replied grimly, "which&#xD;
sent me adrift, cut loose from all I desired, a lonely man, trying&#xD;
to leave myself behind me and to forget my love. But I could&#xD;
not lay violent hands upon Sapho's image, nor-so shut the door&#xD;
upon it that it was not ever present with me. I don't think I.&#xD;
shall make the worse husband though, for my lesson."&#xD;
" Truth is serious, and has few friends, but I have accepted&#xD;
it even when it cut 'deepest, and I'll- try my best to make a&#xD;
more perfect wife for mine," replied Chris, simply.&#xD;
After a long pause, during which both were thoughtful, Otho&#xD;
said in his peculiar, quick, sedate fashion, " When will you go&#xD;
in at the door of the little church on my arm, and come- forth&#xD;
my very own ?"&#xD;
"When, Otho I I cannot answer that. I must go to school&#xD;
Thursday, and there are three busy years before ne, you know,&#xD;
of hard study."&#xD;
"Now I am going to begin to play tyrant, Sapho, and say&#xD;
you shall-not return to Rosenbloom."&#xD;
Chris raised her -eyes - a 'little shade of disappointment&#xD;
dropped over them, which cleared off into smiling radiance in&#xD;
an instant, drawing light from his true, earnest, steady ones,&#xD;
and she replied quietly,&#xD;
" As you please, Otho.&#xD;
"Perhaps you do not know that your betrothed is an indigo&#xD;

fashion, passing sweet, of relinquishment. You shall not give-&#xD;
over study, though ; and we will begin to. live outour dreams,&#xD;
and see the world together."&#xD;
Chris glanced down at her black robes. Otho's eyes followed&#xD;
hers-&#xD;
"'Take them off, Sapho ! I do not like them. They are part&#xD;
and parcel of some old-time customs I count folly, and I cannot&#xD;
bear- to see you' in their sombre shadow. Your brother is in&#xD;
Egypt, and very likely will go to Hindostan before he comes&#xD;
home again. The say-so of the world is of no moment to us.&#xD;
Yoei best friends would sanction your immediate marriage,&#xD;
though it would not matter jn the-'east if they didn't." Chris&#xD;
smiled. He saw it, and 'the grave, pleasant, answering sourire&#xD;
played abouthis masterful mouth, which Chris loved to see,&#xD;
aid he continued, "You have a dear friend at Brookside, ar-&#xD;
rived in the absente of its mistress, who is all ardor to fall upon&#xD;
your neck and give you her blessing."&#xD;
Chris colored; her thoughts flew to Madame.&#xD;
"It if your-faithful old teacher, Miss Filer. I brought her&#xD;
away with me, because" I seemed to know you desired to have&#xD;
her. I Uder-stodd that you would not turn your back upon&#xD;
your fathers house till you, are mine, and I could not permit&#xD;
you to stay alone. You should have seen her when I. proposed&#xD;
the arrangement: Nothing except my height, saved me from&#xD;
a kiss."      '&#xD;
"Dearest Filey !" exclaimed Chris.  "I must hasten to&#xD;
her."'&#xD;
."9Yes, Sapho, -- and my father and mother are shorty com-&#xD;

ing to bless their daughter. If any thing in the wide world could&#xD;
heap my joy, it would be my dear, good father's pleasure in&#xD;
you. He loves his pupil very dearly. And my mother -nay,&#xD;
do not hide your face-my mother also loves you. She told&#xD;
lie so, with some words of confession I hated, to hear her speak&#xD;
- and I entreat you to meet her half-way, as you can grace-&#xD;
fully afford to do - you, who have youth, beauty, and every&#xD;
good and precious gift to bestow upon her only and well-beloved&#xD;
son.  And now tell me, darling, when will you begin to be&#xD;
my slave? That' was your own word, remember ; you gave me&#xD;
the right to use it."&#xD;
"'Thy people shall be my people,' "said Chris, firmly, putting&#xD;
away some uinwelcome intruding memories. "Arrange my life&#xD;
as you like ; it is all yours."&#xD;
"Thanks, sweet, noble Sapho ! I am glad you hagT *s-&#xD;
posed of that cloud. Don't let it come again. You arMve&#xD;
both bought our experience, and paid for it. If we had the&#xD;
nine hundred and ninety-nine years of the Patriarchs before us&#xD;
we might reasonably expect to live the last one in tolerable&#xD;
perfection, but as we have somehow got cut down to a brief&#xD;
span, we must even act our parts as -well as we can, and waste&#xD;
no time in idle regrets. Now, my bride, I want my way en-&#xD;

wore when you threw away my pansies, and afterward took&#xD;
my Provence buds. Dress your hair in that wondrously lovely&#xD;
fashion, and let me come down with Tramp and Zephyr, and&#xD;
carry you off secretly."&#xD;
Chris laughed.&#xD;
"Well, Otho, for a grave, silent man, I must say you hide&#xD;
away a good deal ,   _of very nice, enjoyable romance. I shall&#xD;
like that sort of bridal of all things."&#xD;

Pansy, my Sapho ! now indeed you are mine. Only death shall&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVII.&#xD;
"BLESSED IS THE BRIDE THAT THE SUN SHINES ON."&#xD;
HE few guests were assembled=- the Walsinghams,&#xD;
Bradshaws,Vedders, Slocums, and Groenveldts. Mary&#xD;
Ann Nickson could not come, to her great.grief. She&#xD;
was too poorly --fainting and dizzy, and keeping her bed,&#xD;
half the time. Ruth Blair, clinging to her grand giant; and&#xD;
Uncle Alec, courteous, and rather silent. Mr. Growing walked&#xD;
about under the pines, and talked with his dear friends. The&#xD;
day-was a solemn and touching one, because it was the last&#xD;
couple he expected to join in holy matrimony, of his first flock.&#xD;
Though he confided his intentions to no one except his old&#xD;
friend George,- with whom he had enjoyed many restful,&#xD;
strengthening talks, --and was quietly awaiting the developments&#xD;
of ripening time, he felt pretty well convinced that his course&#xD;
struck off from Roaring River. 'Miss Filer, red-nosed and tear-&#xD;
ful, but very happy, sat on a rustic bench, and looked expect-&#xD;
antly down the winding path. Sonsie, with Rginbow in her&#xD;
arms and Flirt at her feet, was beside her, and of course Jan&#xD;
Vedder leaned against a tree-trunk close by-Sonsie, who&#xD;
hadset her face as'a rosy flint to oppose his entreaties for her&#xD;

&#xD;
presence at this very festivity, and who gladly yielded to Chris's&#xD;
imperative commands, and grasped eagerly the proffered plea-&#xD;
sure made rightfully hers.. The sky was adorned with light&#xD;
masses of cumulus clouds;. softer than carded wool, and the&#xD;
sapphire beyond them was as deep as Sonsie's eyes at the zenith,&#xD;
and melted away down by the horizon into palest azure.. If&#xD;
they had prayed for the day (they did, for aught I know), it&#xD;
couldn't have been more perfect.&#xD;
"'Blessed is the bride that the sun shines on ! " said Sonsie.&#xD;
" I could fancy that other white angels are watching behind&#xD;
yon fleecy veil, to get a look at mine. Ah! I wonder if poor&#xD;
Bax can see her. He's up there somewhere's, and my little&#xD;
sister Malley, and my handsome father, - they're -all there,&#xD;
sure and certain, though no masses were iver said for their&#xD;
souls, and their poor bodies went to rest in unconsecrated&#xD;
ground."&#xD;
"Sonsie !" exclaimed Filer, "are you a Catholic ? "&#xD;
" The O'Rourkes is, ma'am, and the Eagans. I can't justly&#xD;
be said to be, because there was no money for me confirmation&#xD;
frock, and we bein' too poor to pay church dues after we come&#xD;
to Roaring River, Father O'Gorman didn't take the' trouble to&#xD;
hunt us up, and saving the time he interfered to prevent little&#xD;
Briefne from gettin' the good home wid Mrs. Blair, -bad luck&#xD;
to him, -he just left us alone entirely ; and so I am .a kind of&#xD;
outsider. He says I'll go straight to hell, if I don't come to&#xD;
confession, and take Holy Communion, and die at the end in the&#xD;
bosom of the Church ; but Christ is merciful, and -if I'm likely&#xD;
to get left out of heaven on account of not tellin' him what I&#xD;
know, why, the blessed Mary, she'll intercede, I'm sure."&#xD;
" Do 'you pray to the Virgin?" inquired Filer, severely.&#xD;
"Sometimes, ma'am. The ayes slip' easily off. my tongue,.&#xD;
because it is hard to forget what' the good mammy teaches&#xD;

at her knee. 'Twill not harm me if I do ; will it, M&#xD;
Growing?&#xD;
The pastor smiled.&#xD;
" Wasted breath, Sonsie," said he. " Christ bids us come to&#xD;
him; he nowhere directs us to pray to his mother. If it had&#xD;
been wise or expedient for us to do so, he would surely have&#xD;
told us. He neglected several excellent opportunities: for in-&#xD;
stance, when they came and said to him, 'Behold, thy mother&#xD;
standeth without, desiring to speak to thee,' he replied 'Who&#xD;
is my mother ?' and stretching. forth -his hand to his disciples,&#xD;
exclaimed, 'Behold my mother and my brethren.' If he had&#xD;
intended that Mary should be. exalted or adored, surly he&#xD;
would' have made them understand his wishes then ; but oh the&#xD;
-.a                --                          h&#xD;
contrary, we are not informed that he complied with her request&#xD;
to see him. And again, at the marriage in Cana, when his&#xD;
mother told him they had no wine, he replied, ' Woman, what&#xD;
have I to do with thee ?' And the idea of Mary's intercession&#xD;
is unprofitable, because it removes our dear, tender, loving&#xD;
Christ afar from us ; makes him seem a hard master, unwilling&#xD;
to listen to our cries for the help and mercy he died to give us.&#xD;
He who is all sweetness and compassion, he says, 'Come&#xD;
unto me, Iwill give you rest' ; and he always means what he&#xD;
says.'"&#xD;
"I do pray to him!" exclaimed Sonsie, with glistening eyes;&#xD;
"I love him !"&#xD;
Pretty soon the pair came slowly riding up the hill, holding&#xD;
sweet converse. Otho took care to keep his bride's attention&#xD;
with pleasant topics, so that the %trangeness of her .position&#xD;
should not press upon her heat ; and her face was smiling, nay,.&#xD;
radiant, when they drew rein among their friends, and Thomas&#xD;
came and, led away the horses after she had been qietl lifted&#xD;
into her bridegroom's arms. Sonsie observed the sparkling&#xD;
&#xD;
gems she wore, but she did not know that they had beensent&#xD;
from beyond the sea "for Otho's wife."  She observed, also,&#xD;
the loveliness of her "white angel," in her quaint attire,. and the&#xD;
pansy-wreath which bound her shining hair, and the cluster at&#xD;
her throat, and the blossoms, rare, velvet, odorous, which she&#xD;
carried in her hand, as she knelt before the altar. Mr. Grow-&#xD;
ing's earnest prayer and tender benediction were passing sweet.&#xD;
Chris had got Otho's ring upon her finger, his husbandekiss&#xD;
upon her lips, and they walked down toward the great .mansion.&#xD;
The pair paused by common impulse.when they reached the&#xD;
little summer-house, and proud Otho took his wife in his ars,.&#xD;
and promised to himself to be good to her ; and ,hisidea of&#xD;
goodness was exceedingly comprehensive.,  He thorugily&#xD;
knew the ins and outs of the sort of man he had got ,to fight;&#xD;
and if we live, dear reader, we will follow out his married ac-&#xD;
tions, and be our own judges as to how far he kept his word.&#xD;
The dear old Professor came softly to his new daughter, and&#xD;
she threw herself upon his breast. She remembered how she&#xD;
had nestled to his heart in her deep sorrow, and found comfort&#xD;
in his fatherly kindness.&#xD;
" Papa! papa!" said she.&#xD;
His ears drank in the musical accents. They came from&#xD;
her inmost soul, and when she slid down upon her knees at his&#xD;
feet, her husband knelt also and received a share in the pater-&#xD;
nal blessing. Deb was watching for her beloved child when&#xD;
she came down and hoveredaround, longing to take her to her.&#xD;
fond old heart, and have a.little cry over her; and pretty soon&#xD;
she got her desire, for Chris turned and saw her eyes, s wist-&#xD;
ful, and she put her two arms around her neck, and got a&#xD;
good mother's prayer, in which the living Chris and the dead&#xD;
Bessie were all commingled.&#xD;
Sonsie's face was a study; such deep, lustrous eyes ! such&#xD;

smiles!  I almost think that if Jan had asked her then and&#xD;
there to be his wife, he might have surprised her into an an-&#xD;
swer which would have satisfied him, but he did not know it,&#xD;
though he watched and wished for her all the while ; and as for&#xD;
her, he was not in all her thoughts, which were fluttering about&#xD;
her "white angel," caressing her, wondering at her, rejoicing in&#xD;
her, and so expansive was her rich delight, that Mr. Otho also&#xD;
grew glorious in its radiance, and she began to see him worthy&#xD;
of his bride.&#xD;
They were quite a party at the. cars. Uncle Alec, George&#xD;
Blair and his duck, and the pair, all going to Mexico together.&#xD;
And Sonsie saw Christabel's happy face smiling at her, and got&#xD;
the kiss she threw back as the train puffed slowly round the&#xD;
bend, and they caught the shout of " adieu," George sent to them,&#xD;
and Pigeon's little piping echo.; and then Sabrina Bradshaw,&#xD;
the well-bred, delicate, dainty lady, who was chary of forming&#xD;
friendships, who had said that Sonsie Eagan was but a servant&#xD;
in the serving-class, who' could not possibly be her equal or&#xD;
companion, -Sabrina, the queenly, who had been standing&#xD;
with her arm around this girl's waist, and had been sobbing on&#xD;
her shoulder, put up her mouth and kissed the burning, damask&#xD;
cheek, and sought sympathy for their common loss in the great&#xD;
violet eyes, whose lustre was 'veiled beneath their unshed tears.&#xD;
"Cone, now, friend," said she, "let you and I go home."&#xD;
And the Irish lassie knew all the deep value of the earnest&#xD;
words, and was exceeding grateful aid well-pleased " across&#xD;
her gulf."&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Bradshaw, it is indeed time ; we've naught more&#xD;
to keep us here, and I must say you good-by."&#xD;
She picked up Rainbow, whomr his departing mistress had&#xD;
consigned to her new housekeeper, and derfriendiFe'with&#xD;
many fond kisses, and buried her wet face in his soft fur-.&#xD;

"BLESSED IS THE BRIDE."&#xD;

&#xD;
" My 'white angel' is married, for sure, but she is an angel&#xD;
still," said she.&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder's creams were waiting, as well as Sabrina's&#xD;
ponies.&#xD;
"Come, my daughter," said the fairy lady, patting the&#xD;
cushions by her side, " come home now. I have much need of&#xD;
you !&#xD;
"Oli, no," interfered Sabrina, " she is my guest to-night, be-&#xD;
cause I need her, and also because we must rise and journey&#xD;
betimes on the morrow."&#xD;
" It seems expedient that Sonsie should sleep to-night be-&#xD;
neath my roof," said the new housekeeper, with fussy, laughing&#xD;
dignity.&#xD;
Captain Slocum had his cow-ponies ready for Dulcet, and he&#xD;
remarked,&#xD;
"Now, my wife and me, we kinder reckon she ought to tale&#xD;
a look at our seven golden -"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly," put in. Dulcet, laying an impressive hand&#xD;
upon her husband's arm; "our seven beautiful,- precious&#xD;
children."&#xD;
" Massy me," grumbled old Miss Petingill, who had somehow&#xD;
got wind of the private wedding, and had posted down to the&#xD;
cars to examine the party, " what a fuss them people air a&#xD;
akin' over that poor Irish critter ; enough to turn her silly&#xD;
head ! Law ! how folks can !"&#xD;
Sonsie, who had been turning from one to another, much&#xD;
amused and also a little softened, said, with fervid feeling,-&#xD;
" How good you all are tome ! I'll try to be worthy of&#xD;
the kind, respecting feelin's you show me. Oh, yes, I will, in-&#xD;

marriage, -- like a book-story, - of the precious lady she loves&#xD;
and could$not see. Ah, wisha, I'll never forget this bonnie&#xD;
day ! "&#xD;
" But, Sonsie," said Jan, after the Slocams, Bradshaws,-and&#xD;
the rest had left her to him and his mother, "I think a dutiful&#xD;
daughter's first thought should be for her parents, and I know&#xD;
for sure that you have not beep home yet. Of course you are&#xD;
my mother's by adoption ; she insists upon that ; but there's&#xD;
the Eagan family who have claims upon your attention."&#xD;
"You speak truly,'sir," answered Sonsie, trying to fathom&#xD;
his excessive anxiety for performance of her duties. "You say&#xD;
the echo of my very purpose. I'm goin' to kiss me mammy,&#xD;
when fust I've put this bokay, that has the pressure of Miss&#xD;
Chris's putty lips upon it, above me poor father's heart,&#xD;

 "Very well, my dear child, quite right; akid as full of poetry&#xD;
as you always are. Jump up, and I'll drive you," said Mrs.&#xD;
Vedder, well pleased.&#xD;
Again Jan interfered.&#xD;
"No,dearest mamma; you shall not spoil Ollam Folda;&#xD;

,wihyou know, mamma, is of the&#xD;
choicest."&#xD;
The fairy lady laughed, and clapped her jewelled hands.&#xD;
"Oh, my Jan is a rare boy!" said she.&#xD;
ks moter mine! and so we will bid you a good-by,&#xD;
because our 'hour are  unted, and we have much to accom-&#xD;
pliish ry  ust drive thecregms yourself, and I shall deposit&#xD;
this grl safely in the maternal arms."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Come, sir," said Sonsie, briskly ; "-as you say I need a&#xD;
little step ; and I'll try if ye're able to hold the old pace still."&#xD;
As they turned down the pleasant road, which was nearly&#xD;
a lane, walled in by mossy rocks, they met Mrs. Hitchcock,&#xD;
and the charniing Adeliza Euphemia.&#xD;
"Law, ma !" said the young lady, with the spite engendered&#xD;
by seeing Sonsie among the gentlefolks at the station, and the&#xD;
friendly terms they put her, on. " Law ! if there isn't that&#xD;
gutter-snipe again, and dressed up to fits, I do declare 1"&#xD;
For a moment Sonsie had a mind to turn back and leave&#xD;
Jan; and she felt as if she must be out of place, since he was&#xD;
subjected to such insults in her company ; and, if ever she had&#xD;
wavered in her fixed purpose, this would'have made 'her firm&#xD;
as iron; but Jan took the affair easily out of her hands.&#xD;
"You are unlearned in ornithology, I perceive, ladies, else&#xD;
you would know that this is a rare specimen of paradise bird.&#xD;
Permit me to present you to my mother's adopted daughter !"&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Vedder ! you don't say so !" exclaimed the&#xD;
maternal Hitchcock, who had long and ardently desired to put&#xD;
the dweller at Brookedge on her visiting list. . "Do come.,&#xD;
right along and see us, and bring yourparent."&#xD;
"Yes ! pretty creatur, ain't she ! Mrs. Vedder's adopted!&#xD;
Well, I declare !  Adeliza Euphemy, you must. be intimate&#xD;
with her."&#xD;
As soon as the ladies had sailed out of hearing, Sonsie&#xD;
flamed up.&#xD;
"Mr. Jan, you'd no right to say that,". said she; "and it is&#xD;
false, sir !"&#xD;
"Yes, I had. a perfect right; you know my mother always&#xD;
calls you daughter.. I heard her, to-day, and you. can't help&#xD;
yourself. She can adopt you if she pleases, and make you her&#xD;
heir, also, if'it comes to that."&#xD;

"BLESSED IS THE BRIDE."       49,&#xD;
&#xD;
Sonsie was absolutely breathless, very nearly frightened, he&#xD;
put it so much as a finished thing,--a matter of course,.-&#xD;
and she made haste to assert herself.&#xD;
"You'll have to drop that kind of 'talk, Mr. Vedder, or you&#xD;
will force me to take leave of you once for all. I am Sonsie&#xD;
Eagan, and you know it; and I count it real unkind of you too,&#xD;
when I can't go back on my word to Miss Chris, and am forced&#xD;
to be a debtor to your mother for a season. But I'll get me&#xD;
independence again, sooner nor ye think; and, as for that&#xD;
young woman, with her tallow face and her corkscrew curls,&#xD;
she is far wiser nor you are ; and she speaks but as the world&#xD;
speaks."&#xD;
Jan saw that he was on dangerous ground, and made haste&#xD;
to change the subject, and talk about the up-pastre farm, and&#xD;
to enlarge upon the manifold virtues of his new tenant.&#xD;
"Oh, dear, how purty 1" exclaimed Sonsie, who gladly fol-'&#xD;
lowed his lead, and gave herself up to hearty enjoyment of her&#xD;
walk. They paused in sight of the old stone house, railed in&#xD;
with its trim garden; its great hop-yards, vast barns, and&#xD;
latticed corn-cribs, and the green croft, where turkeys, ducks,&#xD;
Spanish fowls, and quacking geese were enjoying themselves&#xD;
in luxurious plenty, and ever so many motherly hens were&#xD;
calling their broods together, and handsome, sleek cows were&#xD;
waiting to" be milked, and a couple of heavy farm horses were&#xD;
drinking at the great trough, through which flowed a running&#xD;
spring, limpid, and clear and some half-grown colts rubbed&#xD;
about the hay-ricks, and the tall well-sweep poised in full view&#xD;
the dripping, mossy old bucket. "How purty! purty!".&#xD;
"Couldn't you as easily 'say pretty ?" asked- Jan, soberly,&#xD;
who -cunning fellow   sometimes used his superior English&#xD;
as. a power to help keep the wilful lassie in order, especially&#xD;
after he had made a, mis-step, as to-day, and knew thiat he had&#xD;
&#xD;
lost groutr d and saw and felt that she was thinking over her&#xD;
position and his, and weighing every thing, "across her gulf."&#xD;
" Pretty,-sir," said she, easily. " Thanks ! and all the asturs&#xD;
and hollyhorks, and stercions, and those ; they're pretty, too."&#xD;
A tall, well-knit, active boy came through thegate with a&#xD;
hoe on his shoulder, followed by a stout laborer, to whom he&#xD;
was giving directions for clearing the green corn. His hair&#xD;
was red as hair could be, and his eyes as blue as Sonsie's, and&#xD;
his face clean and fresh and wholesome, and though his teeth&#xD;
still projected, they were white and clean.&#xD;
"0 Mr. Vedder, sir !". he exclaimed, in glad tones. "Come&#xD;
and see me colts !" Then, observing the young lady in black,&#xD;
who was transfixed with astonishment, he pulled off his straw&#xD;
hat, and grinned; and Sonsie Eagan dashed through the gate,&#xD;
and hugged her beloved brother, the partner of her early trials,&#xD;
the idol of her inmost soul.&#xD;
"Dennie, my blessed, darlin' ! you are workin' on the up-&#xD;
-pasture farm for Mr. Vedder, and you never told me a word.&#xD;
Dear, dear Dennie ! and you're so grown !"&#xD;
"No, .faith, mavourneen ; 'ti meself that I'm workin' for,&#xD;
sure," replied he; "I'm  me own man. And look, Sister&#xD;
Sonsie, at the height I've got! as gret as his own; and he's me&#xD;
model of a man intirely."&#xD;
"Yes, Ollam Folda," answered Jan, observing the pair with&#xD;
pleasure. "This young Irishman is his own master ; and it is&#xD;
a widow's home that I have made of the place. You know it&#xD;
was yourself who proposed the enterprise to me; and I hope&#xD;
you will approve of my first widow. There she. stands! She&#xD;
employs this mirthful youngster.- who, I must say, develops&#xD;
remarkable capacities for. work, as well .as blarney - as&#xD;
steward."&#xD;

ing to meet her. The quick sight of mother-love had espied'&#xD;
her much wishedifor child, whose helpfulness and bravery had&#xD;
kept her alive in her deep troubles, and she yearned to get a&#xD;
good kiss from her ripe lips; and as Jan stood back and&#xD;
watched- the meeting, he was reminded of the Celt's descrip-&#xD;
tion, " Eyes as blue as the flax-flower, and smile like a gleam&#xD;
of God's blessing;" and he thought it still 'applied to the&#xD;
comely woman, to whom comfort was ;bringing back the bloom&#xD;
of her youth. She was very nicely dressed. in dark stuff, and&#xD;
had on a silk apron, and her fair hair, still abundant, was&#xD;
smooth and glossy. The gentle blood of the O'Rouke's was&#xD;
very imanifest m her quiet bearing; an; Sonsie's face was glad&#xD;
and happy.&#xD;
"Is not this farm, yours, Mrs. Eagan ?" asked Jan. "Your&#xD;
daughter is an infidel !&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, my darling, The holy saints have raised us,&#xD;
up kind friends, and this young gentleman is-the best of them&#xD;
all.. , The lease of this beautiful home is ours; and I am more&#xD;
thankful nor I can tell."&#xD;
"Ah, Sonsie! 'tis jolly to be  farmer. I mean to be a rich&#xD;
one. Mr.. Bradshaw says I may, and I'll work for it. Yes,&#xD;
indeed, I mean to be somebody. This is better than boot-&#xD;
black -'Shine your boots, sir ? union shine1' _-no more of&#xD;
that, dear, and no more street-sweeping, nor starvin' either.&#xD;
You, who are a real lady already,. shall not blush for your&#xD;
kindred. We'll school the. little ones, and we'll keep the&#xD;
mother nice. (Isn't she fresh as a rose, mavourneen?  I've&#xD;
the chance now that you and me- used to talk of in the long&#xD;
nights when we couldn't sleep for starving wid the cold; and&#xD;
you may just stand by till I show you what a brave boy can&#xD;
make of hisself."&#xD;
Sonsie -gave, him another bug. She was crying, and her&#xD;
&#xD;
cheeks were wet, and red as the crimson carnation; but she&#xD;
didn't care. She flew to the children, and caught them up and&#xD;
ueezed them; and how her blithe tongue did run ! and how&#xD;
ichl she twirled her "r's!" and what a queer mingling of&#xD;
ssia and Burns there was in the whole family, - Mickie,&#xD;
and Mistie, and Kate, and Briefne, the wonderful baby.&#xD;
Jan' enjoyed himself hugely, and they had a famous supper&#xD;
to ether, and he talked up the Irish stock with Dennis i and&#xD;
then they all went and examined the Kerry cows, and the&#xD;
Kyloes, and the Ayrshires; and Sonsie found. her little, blayk&#xD;
pig in a nice tidy pen of his own, munching yellow corn ; and&#xD;
he knew her, and came to have his back scratched with a stick,&#xD;
and grunted out his satisfaction.&#xD;
Poor Jan tried half a dozen times to make an opportunity&#xD;
to get the honest girl he loved to himself, and ask her the&#xD;
momentous question, but couldn't see it just come right; and&#xD;
so he left her, as he ,had promised, in the maternal arms, and&#xD;
returned to think about her, at Brookedge.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVIII.&#xD;
FRIPON THE JOCKEY.&#xD;
HE Rev. Fred Growing was quite aware of the move-&#xD;
ment which was crawling toward his removal from his&#xD;
field of labor, but he would not help it with a finger,&#xD;
or notice it in any way. The paper being tolerably covered with&#xD;
names, and much drumming not adding more to their number,&#xD;
the committee waited upon the pastor, to call his attention to&#xD;
it, expecting to overwhelm him with consternation. They&#xD;

&#xD;
found him in the clerical apartment -of the new church, where&#xD;
he was fond of sitting, perfect quiet being insured to him in&#xD;
this his sanctum, no wife nor babies having the entree, to up.&#xD;
set his meditations. Opposite the arm-chair he occupied in&#xD;
the great window, sat, in a duplicate chaise-de-ehne, a gentle.&#xD;
man, whom he introduced as " My friend Laprise." The two&#xD;
were talking earnestly, and as it seemed enjoyingly, for both&#xD;
were smiling, and looked alive.&#xD;
The ease, cordiality, nay, absolute friendliness, of his recep.&#xD;
tion, made it difficult for the visitors to open their rather un-&#xD;
pleasant business, and Deacon Proddy nudged Deacon Wil-&#xD;
liams, and Deacon Williams made faces at Esq. Hitchcock,&#xD;
who stroked his Saturday-night beard, and tilted his chair onto&#xD;
its hind legs, and kept silence. Mr. Nickson took the mat-&#xD;
ter into his own hands, as he was very fond of doing, and&#xD;
tramped straight down to the point, regardless- of polite forms&#xD;
or amiable conventionalities. He had been drinking, and his&#xD;
tongue was limber, and his eyes rather bloodshot ; but he was&#xD;
still far from the state of mind which frequently impelled him&#xD;
to press the inquiry concerning'the identity of his papa-in-law&#xD;
with the love-sick Montague. -&#xD;
"Got a little business with you, friend Growing. Perhaps&#xD;
we had better see you alone."&#xD;
"No occasion for that, I igiagine, sir. My friend Laprise&#xD;
is a very old friend, tried and weighed, and knows my affairs&#xD;
quite well."-&#xD;
Mr. Nickson treated Mr. Laprise to a stare. He had no&#xD;
idea of such friendship, and there was something in the gentle-&#xD;
man's face which affected him unpleasantly, and he experien-&#xD;
ced a sort of resentment at his interfering presence.&#xD;
"Don't go, Ernest, I insist. We won't be long. -These&#xD;
gentlemen are all men of renowned capacity for dispatch of&#xD;
&#xD;
affairs, and understand the value of time. I cannot permit&#xD;
you to leave me till we have settled our 'planes of being' argu-&#xD;
ment. It has got to be comprehensively talked up before I&#xD;
can rest -ins quiet, and I have you so nearly cornered that I&#xD;
long to"go in andfnish you. Now, then, i am quite at your&#xD;
service, gentlemen."&#xD;
" Oh, well, if you don't care, Idon't know why we should.&#xD;
We have been appointed to wait on you, and inform yon that&#xD;
the people are of opinion that your usefulness is about used&#xD;
up here. ,Preaching don't suit. You don't study enough. I&#xD;
mysef am obliged to-read up a couple of sermons a week; for&#xD;
fodder, from Sunday to Sunday. You don't visit enough.&#xD;
They say they don't see nothing of you. You haven't got- any&#xD;
tact -don't notice the children, and such things, and-you don't&#xD;
live within your salary."&#xD;
'That is certainly true," remarked Mr. Growing, pleasantly,&#xD;
"inasmuch as I have been living without it for the past six&#xD;
months, thanks to the dilatoriness of my financial committee,&#xD;
of whom Mr. Nickson-is one."&#xD;
"Well, you can't form any idea' how difficult it is to raise&#xD;
money for you. You see you are so confounded unpopular,&#xD;
the folks get baulky right off. We got the sense of the con-&#xD;
gregation before we came, as this document will show," unfold-&#xD;
ing a long paper, as he spoke. e -know just what- horses&#xD;
'll run."&#xD;
The young pastor took it, ran his eye down the page, and&#xD;
smiled, though there were some names there he had not expected&#xD;
to see - Dr. Jenkins's, for instance. He observed -that it was a&#xD;
MilIville document. No Roaring River people, except a few&#xD;
of Jan Vedder's tenants, and a new man who had set up a&#xD;
fulling mill down below, almost over the border into Pleasant&#xD;
Valley, andmany of the signers were perfect strangers=to him.&#xD;

It looked as though they had been out into the highways and&#xD;
hedges, and compelled them to come in.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said Mr. Growing, placing very quie'q y the&#xD;
listn the table, and laying his hand over it, "if I cse to&#xD;
remain, I cpuld do it, in spite of you... This paper i purely&#xD;
sectional. Not only could I stay, but I could force you to ac-&#xD;
cept me as your pastor, or, secede altogether, divide the con.&#xD;
gegation, take .the IRoaring River side for rny own, and this&#xD;
begtiful church, which I have livedto;see completed, I&#xD;
know precisely where I stand. -I am. not taken by surprise.&#xD;
I have been aware from the first of this movement, and could&#xD;
tell you who have egged it on. Don't be uneasy, gentlemen; I&#xD;
am no promoter of schism. You, Deacon, Williams, and Esq.&#xD;
Hitchcock, have stood shoulder to shoulder with me on the&#xD;
building committee, and I owe you thanks. You have&#xD;
contributed generously, and worked bravely and well. But&#xD;
the field is the world.. I shall never forget my first parish. I&#xD;
have gained a large experience among you; have been taught&#xD;
many useful things. If God spares my life, I can work better&#xD;
for my stay here. You. took me, a boy, and you have borne&#xD;
all my blunders and mistakes, and. I go, out a man, and I thank&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Deacon Williams got up,and took hold of the young minis-&#xD;
ter's hand. He had come    e meeting, wife-driven, most un-&#xD;
willingly. The memory o   is dead 'boy was clinging about&#xD;
him. The sick-room days, so rich in blessing to.them all,&#xD;
binding their souls with the three-fold cord which cannot be&#xD;
broken, were full of the prayers and holy ministry of this slight&#xD;
dreaming, hard-working enthusiast, whom they were forcing&#xD;
him to conspire gainss, and weak and faint-spirited as he was,&#xD;
the poor, weazened, Deaconfelt, c9nstrained to lift his voi e in&#xD;
feeble protestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
" We love you, Mr. Growing. For my part, I want you to&#xD;
stay, though my name is down on that pap,0  As you may&#xD;
s, in a manner, I didn't ought to put it there, and e'na&#xD;
ho ed I could scratch it off afore you seenit. You=seem as&#xD;
to meas if you was my own boy. You do, really. I do&#xD;
know of no mistakes. I never see you make noblunders. I&#xD;
believe the speerit of the Lord is upon you, as much as ever&#xD;
it was on young Sam'el in the temple. I shan't get no minis-&#xD;
ter that will ever be the same to me as you are. My dear,&#xD;
dear boy. I somehow feel as if I wasn't going, to stop long,&#xD;
and I wlod like to hey you by my.bedside when the dread&#xD;
summons comes. I don't care so much about preaching , but 1&#xD;
do think your is drefful siritooal, and your prayers air worth&#xD;
all the sermons in the world."&#xD;
The Deacon shook Fred's hand up and down, while 'his&#xD;
watery eyes were fixed'upon the young man's working face,&#xD;
and his voice trembled, broke down in fact, before he pulled&#xD;
out his handkerchief, and mopped his cheeks, and went and&#xD;
sat down in a corner, comforting himself with the couplet"&#xD;
which seemed to be an unfailing bah in the most distressful&#xD;
circumstances.&#xD;

could not in the least understand the magnetism of per.&#xD;
sincerity, honest singleness of heart, and absolute. sympa-&#xD;
which the pastor carried about with him like an atnos-&#xD;
phere, which took him out of himself into the inmost souls of&#xD;
his hearers. So great was his power, joined to a peculiar voice&#xD;
of marvellous depth and sweetness, speaking irresistibly to the&#xD;
emotional nature, that Iremember, on one occasion, a brother&#xD;
minister of his' told me he was affected to tears by hearing him&#xD;
offer a prayer at a funeral, though he was too far off to catch&#xD;
the words of the petition. Of a truth,.a coarse-fibred person&#xD;
like the jockey banker could not be touched by any such in-&#xD;
fluences; and he uttered some angry, abusive, personal words&#xD;
in enforcing the necessity of a change in, the pastorate, which&#xD;
no gentleman could have spoken, which were a trifle horsey&#xD;
and underbred, if not actually profane for a Christian hero.&#xD;
Mr. Growing's eye kindled, but he kept his temper, and&#xD;
calmly waited for the supply of billingsgate to exhaust itself, or&#xD;
for the speaker's breath to give out. Not so his friend Laprise.&#xD;
He took up the conversation, nd addressed Mr. Nickson in a&#xD;
cutting, sarcastic tone, wa g_ the "mebbys" and "Jes&#xD;

into his eyes with the same genial, fond look he had used to&#xD;
wear when the two were boys together.&#xD;
" You need not interfere, Fred, my lad," returned Laprise,&#xD;
" Just you keep quiet.' I'm going to do a little talking now.&#xD;
Sit down, gentlemen. Let us consider this minister-business&#xD;
settled. It was as good as arranged, I think, before you came&#xD;
in. Frederick Rutter Growing won't have to hunt for work to&#xD;
do. Rest is what he needs just. now.. You have nearly used&#xD;
him up here ; worked him like a cart-horse. He has been&#xD;
spinning along, steam up, top speed, no brakes on, and I'll en-&#xD;

take care of that fine-strung body of his, or he won't stay to&#xD;
enjoy many more such pleasant committee interviews. Cali-&#xD;
fornia will about fit his case for a summer trip. Come, Dea-&#xD;
con Proddy, don't let brother Nickson hurry you off. I'm go&#xD;
ing to tell a story. You- love good stories, -I know by your&#xD;
double chin. You see this minister, who has been dispensing&#xD;
the word to you, was a college chum of mine. We hung to-&#xD;
gether upon the breast of our Alma Mater. I am afraid- we&#xD;
were rather wild fellows. Fred thinks so now. We found&#xD;
plenty of scrapes and larks and fun, upon which to expend&#xD;
our surplus vitality. The vineyard was not open to us then,&#xD;
or, if it was, we did not know it. My dear .Fred's pastorate&#xD;
among you has not improved his muscle, but in- those jolly&#xD;
days he could pull stroke-oar, and make the best time in the&#xD;
class ; and as for base-ball, quoits, billiards, tenpins nothing&#xD;
could touch him, an when he put on the gloves, it waytime&#xD;
for his man to     his elbows." 'Mr. Laprise threw up his.&#xD;

gotten his youthful lessons in the manly art of self-defence,&#xD;
whatever his reverend friend might have done. " Our class&#xD;
got perfectly mad on the subject of horses ; and those of us&#xD;
who could afford it kept our fast trotters. Nay, Jackey Fripon,&#xD;
I insist. Positively, I shall take it ill of you to leave me in&#xD;
the lurch, before I have spun out my tale. Well, gentlemen,&#xD;
we got up a race -the best three in five, under the saddle&#xD;
over at Dodd's Four Corners. We had to do it all on the sly,&#xD;
and you may be sure we did not call each other any long&#xD;
names in our meetings. -But though we wickedly disobeyed&#xD;
college rules, we made it up in -royal lessons - did we not,&#xD;
Fred ? and in all the tight places we stood by each. other in&#xD;
those days, and we do still. By Jupiter, don't we, old boy?"&#xD;
To the intense astonishment of the Deacons, the chums&#xD;
reached over and grasped each other's hands, with glistening&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"I got hold of a fellow for my trainer and, jockey, and I&#xD;
thought myself lucky. I believe he' hailed from Canada -&#xD;

was a done thing, though I must say Jackey 'promised like a&#xD;
hogmy, and performed like a pigmy.' The bets were heavy,&#xD;
much heavier than we would have liked to tell our governors,&#xD;
or write home about. I had spent no end of money that term,&#xD;
and I looked to pay up out of 'my winnings, but when it came&#xD;

made a clean breast of my follies, and he paid' my debts, and&#xD;
that ended my betting forever. but, as I was sang, Fred,&#xD;
here, who' had been watchingthe horses, eager for me to win,&#xD;
&#xD;
shouted in everybodys ears that the jockey did it by a trick&#xD;
and blazed up, and told him he was a ''scoundrelly, cheatin&#xD;
puppy,' and deserved 'hose-whipping, and was all ready to&#xD;
kick him out neck and heels, in 'his 'hot indignatioini  Fred&#xD;
Rutter never could beiarny trickery. Jockey Fripon was in-&#xD;
solent; showed his fists, talked filth, knockedoff Fred's new&#xD;
beaver, and this pastor of yours 'went in and olished off&#xD;
Jackey handsomely. You 'ought to have seen the battle, Dea-&#xD;

you ever witnessed ! and:I see poor Fripon sports a couple of&#xD;
false teeth, to supply a vacancy which occurred that evening&#xD;
after the race at Dodd's Four Corners:"&#xD;
His explaining finger pointed'the moral, and of course all&#xD;
eyes rested upon the banker. The good deacons were quite&#xD;
excited with the racy story, which had about it a strong, smack-&#xD;
ing relish, and flavor of plucky- youth; and their tongues got&#xD;
extremely limber over their own exploits, and the fights and&#xD;
frolics they 'had known in their "juicy period," and they&#xD;
laughed, one and all, when they contemplated the unfortunate&#xD;
jockey, overthrown and discomfited.&#xD;
SI'm 'a selfmade niah," he'growled.  'I never said but&#xD;

whole on't. I want to blame for your mare breaking up, no&#xD;
more than I am for your reeling off such a lot of d--d&#xD;
nonsense just now in our business meeting.".&#xD;
" Look here, Fripon ; you are are rightly named. Look&#xD;
here !"  He-took a darning-needle from his pocket-book, and&#xD;
held it up before the' banker. " Tom Knox gave me that ! I&#xD;
saw him pull it out of Polly's shoulder, and I've kept it ever&#xD;
since, and - hold on, Fripon !-- I've a couple of witnesses I&#xD;
can produce any time, besides your particular friend Tom&#xD;
(whose oath might not be good for much), who will swear how&#xD;
it got there."&#xD;
Mr. Nickson looked like a whipped dog. He caught up his&#xD;
hat and slunk away, and none of them moved a finger to stay&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Deacon Williams, as may be supposed, was not especially&#xD;
delighted with the relation of these jockey experiences of, his&#xD;
son-in-law, and he went over the affair in .his wife's hearing,&#xD;
when he reached home, with a most disgusted countenance,&#xD;
which changed into pitiful sorrow when he thought of his'&#xD;
dear daughter.&#xD;
"Well, what of it ?" was the reply his spouse gave him,&#xD;
when he had finished. "Nickson has got apast all that are&#xD;
now; he's made his money. -I ain't .goin' to trouble myself to&#xD;
go pryin' and peekin' round, to nose out what he used to was.&#xD;
I don't make no account of the thimble-rig you played along&#xD;
with the. drivers, when you was a young feller, though'they do&#xD;
say you got your start, out o'that and old sledge, two cents a&#xD;
game, when you kep' the. toll-gate down to ' The Devil's Half&#xD;
Acre."'        '&#xD;
" I have repented of those deeds long since, Miss Williams,&#xD;
in dust and ashes, as you .may say, in-a manner, and I've done&#xD;
my best to make it up too," replied the Deacon, with some&#xD;

dignity ; "and I'll right other wrongs before it is too late, if&#xD;

ing anything about this man. You've gone and married my&#xD;
poor girl to him. I hope he treats her well. She seems to be&#xD;
ruther 'fraid of' him a'ready."&#xD;
"Nonsense, Deacon ! don't you be gettin' up bugbears, and&#xD;
fightin' of 'em.., Mary Ann has got a rich husband, a hand-&#xD;
some house, and the best horses in Millville, and I should-&#xD;
really admire to know what she could ask for more ! Don't&#xD;
be a fool, I beg on ye, no more than ye can help. Why can't&#xD;
ye keep yer boots still on the rug there, and not be all the&#xD;
while prancin' round, wearin' out the carpet ?"  The kind,&#xD;
weak, anxious. father was silenced, but not satisfied, and he&#xD;
put on his.hat, and went up to visit his daughter, and he looked&#xD;
at her, trying to believe she was not unhappy. She had Nancy&#xD;
and Tip with her, and was teaching them the game of authors,&#xD;
and the Deacon was coaxed to join them, half-afraid, half-&#xD;
ashamed of the novel ide of contributing to the pleasures ,of&#xD;
his children, by assisting at a forbidden game ; and then he&#xD;
wound up with a quiet, comfortable talk with this growing&#xD;
young Christian, who demonstrated every day the power of&#xD;
Jesus' love to strengthen, refine, and round the character; and&#xD;
he went home revolving in his mind certain obligations which&#xD;
he had lately become convinced devolved upon him, and with&#xD;
which his grasping love of money was constantly interfering.&#xD;
He was about to make restitution where he had -il&#xD;
frauded, and was thinking up the cases he could remnem&#xD;
noting them carefally:down.&#xD;
The very first thing he did in- the Gonecusset=office, on the&#xD;
Monday following, was to take his will from the safe; button it&#xD;
into his pocket, looking through the glass door as he turned&#xD;
the key, and making quite.sure nobody saw}him. But he did&#xD;

RE new' church was full the next morning after the&#xD;
dointitte mraeeting and Mr. Growing preached a&#xD;
splendid discourse. His friend Ernest Laprise, and a&#xD;

Dr. Perfect gave out whe he Yohanged 9ceato the, pulpit&#xD;
of the old stone church, " Melchisedek, theg  hgHpri4st,"&#xD;
which they sung to "Mear," and cut into- riru: fragments,&#xD;
But then the soul of the reverend. divine was not attuned.te&#xD;
minstrelsy. He preached sermons an hour, ad a -quarter&#xD;
long, all about "wrath,", and considered _the services o.the&#xD;
sanctuary. in which he had no voice -as de tra.nd waste of&#xD;
time.         '..&#xD;
I am clearly getting, old ! I must, 1eto pratw.and xamble&#xD;

and prayed, and labored together long -enough, and that a&#xD;
change would be desirable, oblige me by standing up for one&#xD;

Mrs Williams, exceeding -red in the face, nodded to Mrs.&#xD;
Esq ."Hitchcotkwho chewed her dried fennel, and shook her&#xD;
head about, and- sat still. -John Nickson got half-way u , but&#xD;
as he saw nobody else was, going to rise, he slouched down&#xD;
again, and fumbled about, pretending to hunt for something he&#xD;
had not lost. Deacon Proddy pulled his hair up over the bald&#xD;
place, and 'Deacon McCross murmured "jes so, jes so,"-.-&#xD;
with his eyes fixed upon the minister, and his underlip hanging,&#xD;
and Deacon Williams sobbed in his handkerchief. The Roar-&#xD;
ing Riverites looked indignant and surprised, the paper having&#xD;
been' sedulously kept from their knowledge; and while the&#xD;
young'pastor's eagle glance swept the congregation, a dead&#xD;
stillness fell upon them all.&#xD;
"What, nmy friends' are there none who will stand up to&#xD;
their opinions?' That 'is : strange, since so many of you have&#xD;
been willing to put-your names here.&#xD;
He lifted the paper in full view of the audience.&#xD;
"Just give me youi attention one moment,-&#xD;
He read the-preamble 'and "resolutions, which were personal&#xD;
and very ,nearly abusive in their tenor,/and the list 'of names&#xD;
which endorsed 'them.' Some of the men picked up their hats&#xD;
from under theseats, and threw their bandanas into them;&#xD;
Mrs. Williams fanned herself'°violently, and looked very hot;&#xD;
old Miss- Petingill audibly whispered to-Marsha, 'Peculiar!&#xD;
how folks can,"and some of 'the other sisters wriggled about&#xD;
and made faces, and sniffed;and wished they were beyond the&#xD;

it was as the stature of a man, and beside it, a rounded mound,&#xD;
with smooth-cut turf, and fresh blossoms at its. head and foot,&#xD;
and a little. .pathway,'daily trodden by loving feet, led up to it&#xD;

her up. Consumption is an ugly word, but broken heart is a&#xD;
worser, and her stepmother may feel it yet, strong as she is.&#xD;
She's got to: take her turn. Oh, if mothers could only see what&#xD;
their children has got to-go through, and they a-dying. . I seem&#xD;
as if they'd fight off death and stop till they'd growed a spell.&#xD;
To think of the times that poor Bessie's been through. Well,&#xD;
well,--she'll forget 'em all when she gets up to her dear, sweet&#xD;
ma -_seventeen, eighteen. Why, it must be Mary Ann NicX.&#xD;
son: I saw her look like a ghost to ineetin' last night. I told&#xD;
the. Deacon when we was coming home, that girl wasn't long&#xD;
for this world.. I declare, if it isn't tolling yet.- Massey me!&#xD;
got up to sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two. It must be old Miss&#xD;
Petingill. I haven't heard she was down with any thing, but that&#xD;
must be about her age. She don't let on, but I know she was&#xD;
born -same year as Jedidiah,' and he's going on sixty-three.&#xD;
Green corn, or cucunibers, niebby, or veal. Well, poor soul,&#xD;
weve all got to go. Bless me, if that don't beat the Dutch.&#xD;
There's the creatur' comin down the road, as chirk as a gimlet,&#xD;
when I was just thinkin' probably she was dead. How de do,&#xD;
Miss Petingill, ain't it desput queer ? I 'heard the bell when it&#xD;
went sixty-two, and I thought it was tolling for you, but you are.&#xD;
worth twenty dead cats, ain't you ?"&#xD;
"Pretty peculiar, I should say. What had sixty-two to do&#xD;
with me, pray ? you must be sick, to be~ layin' the passin' bell&#xD;

"Deacon Williams ! Why, du tell. What did they think&#xD;

" You'd best ask me, if you want to find out, Miss Proddy.&#xD;
I just come from there," said Miss Petingill sharply, still turn-&#xD;
ing over the sixty-strokes in her mind. " I've got life enough&#xD;
left to answer questions yet a while, if you did think I was&#xD;
dead."&#xD;
" Law, Miss Petingill, don't be offended. It might have&#xD;
been you well enough, and 'twill before long, likely. * Come,*&#xD;
what was it?"&#xD;
" Ship fever ! I watched last night. He dropped off as&#xD;
slick as a mitten."&#xD;
" Well, I - declare, and I never knew he was sick! 'How&#xD;

- "No more didn't anybody. He only got up from New York in&#xD;
the four o'clock train yesterday. Of course it was sudden ; it&#xD;
allus is. He's a beautiful corpse, the wrinkles all smoothed&#xD;
out, and as peaceful as-a baby. We've just done layin' him&#xD;

Mrs.-De con Williams got over her second funeral occasion&#xD;
creditably, and as soon as the house was set to rights, she&#xD;
and Mr. Nickson had the will opened. It was a trial to wait&#xD;
that long, but they did.. When Esq. Hitchcock got as far as&#xD;
"I give and bequeath to my wife Silence," she put up her grief.&#xD;
bordered handkerchief, and heaved a deep sigh; but when she&#xD;
became aware that she got only the interest of ten thousand dol-&#xD;
lars, to be forfeited: upon. a second marriage, she vehemently.&#xD;
stormed.  MrNickson considered it, a. capital joke, and&#xD;
"gunned, consmedly," but he left off in a hurry when they&#xD;
reached the codicil. Baxter's portion added to Mary Ann's,&#xD;
and, in event of her death without heirs, both to go to her kind-&#xD;

CHAPTER LI&#xD;
PRIDE AND POVERTY, AND SONSIE.&#xD;
OR a year and moreSonsie Eagan had been a diligent&#xD;
student at Rosenbloom. The little disagreeables of&#xD;
her position.soon wore off. She kept firmly to her res-&#xD;
olution to attend to her business and ignore all taunts and jeers,&#xD;
and as she had assured Ruth, " Sorra ailing thepupils ever got at&#xD;
her, it :being impossible to.neglect a girl. who kept.sedulously&#xD;
apart, wasting no minutes.": Sabrina Bradshaw was kind, con-&#xD;
siderate, and helpful before Chris's wedding, and after that she&#xD;
was loving. Peace Pelican was a host in herself,- and she,&#xD;
espoused Sonsie's interests, at first "out of contrariness" and&#xD;
love of mischief, slyly contriving to get amusement out of the&#xD;
Celtic lassie's quaint English and frononcs character, but very&#xD;
soon from warn liking for the comely, blooming maid, who, as&#xD;
Professor Noble said, " worked like a cart-horse"&#xD;
Jan Vedder was seeking a match span of roans for the up-&#xD;
pasture farm, and announced as much in a brief note to the&#xD;
Ulsterlassie,-andalse his intentin tQ pay b  little&#xD;

Sabnna was in Sonsie's room when Sarah came up to an&#xD;
nounce -his arrival.&#xD;
'% 'd put on a fresh dress and some new ribbons, if I were&#xD;

cambric, I know, and I shall come down in my purple percale ;&#xD;
and Susie Jenkins has just got a new nansook, with fifteen ruf-&#xD;
fles on the skirt, beautifully fluted."&#xD;
Sonsie flushed up, and sat awhile with her eyes fixed on the&#xD;
great trunk, marked&#xD;
SONSIE EAGAN,&#xD;
Roaring River,&#xD;
which was locked and corded in the corner, and then she got&#xD;
up, and brushed her merino, and rubbed away at some spots on&#xD;
the front breadth, and put a few fresh stitches into a darn in the&#xD;
sleeve, and lamented a little over its general faded appearance,&#xD;
and wished Jan Vedder would stay away and leaveher;.in&#xD;
peace.&#xD;
She passed a delightful evening notwithstanding, and enjoyed&#xD;
his home news, all particulars of the lives of the inmates of the&#xD;
up-pasture farm, and about the mission boys, and the letters&#xD;
he read from Mr. Craigenfels ; and then she brought forth hers&#xD;
from Ruth and Chris, and talked up their absent friends :to&#xD;
minute particulars, :and the New York trip, and the. seven&#xD;
children ; and really she discovered that she had many subjects&#xD;
in common with the young Dutchman. She was unconsciously&#xD;
proud of his dashing ways and manly carriage. He sat down&#xD;
at the study table, and divided his attentions between her and&#xD;
Sabrina, and -his whimsical applications of the lessons, which&#xD;
he enriched with many items not laid down in the text.. He&#xD;
attended her at table, while conversing with Herr Groenveldt&#xD;
and Professor Noble on church architecture and farming, and&#xD;
she listened eagerly. When he sang duets, with Sabrina she&#xD;
came and sat down by the piano, and somehow the .same sense&#xD;
of outsideness possessed her afresh which she had felt in&#xD;
watching them up the aisle at Zoe's wedding.&#xD;
" I've heard you sing, Sonsie, in Mission. School. Suppose&#xD;

heard Dennie come out on 'Marching on,' last Sunday. He&#xD;
leads the boys now. He has a wonderful. voice."&#xD;
" Deax Denaie I he's. a brave, good lad," said Sonsie, with&#xD;
deepening eyes.&#xD;
"He is indeed a noble, honest fellow, and is making a capi-&#xD;
tal farmer,'" replied Jan quietly, "and he is fully determined to&#xD;
be a rich man. The proud young O'Rouke begins to talk&#xD;
about founding a family. -There is no limit to his ambition;&#xD;
and with hishealth and vigor he can do anything he likes."&#xD;
Sabrina could not help curiously regarding this couple, so&#xD;
oddly drifting towards each other out of thedifferent grades,&#xD;
and felt"that Seusie looked -as worthy to fill the place as any&#xD;
lady of them all. Pace Pelican said as much, and added,&#xD;
A Nature makes-. gentlefolks once in a while, and out brave&#xD;
Sonsie is one of hers. She can'thelp rising, anymore than the&#xD;
cream can help coming to the top of the milk "_&#xD;
Sabrina nodded and smiled.&#xD;
"Sonsie, dear," said she with a little authority, "come and&#xD;
sing 'Shamus O'Brien' for Mr. Vedder, and I will company&#xD;
you.'&#xD;
The maid rose instantly, and if you wished to get an opinion&#xD;
upon her singing, Jan was the.man for you. Words certainly&#xD;
failed to express his delight, and then she played some marches&#xD;
and quicksteps, agd" some of the prettyareels his ,mother had&#xD;
playedouposw the occasion of the first tea-drinking, and Jan&#xD;
could hardly believe hig ears.&#xD;
" Itseems like magic, Ollam Folda; " how did you manage&#xD;
to doait so~quickly ?".&#xD;
Hard work did it, Jan," said Sabrina, "aided by a quick ear&#xD;

"I hope madame will make you pay well for yer keeping, if'&#xD;
you come so often," said Sonsie saucily. "You've a brave ap-&#xD;
petite of your own,"&#xD;
" I am a farmer, Sonsie, cultivating muscle by hard labor. A&#xD;
useful member of society, thanks to you. No whiskey in my&#xD;
breath to-day, is there?"&#xD;
"I didn't notice it yet, sir ; and 'tis true for you, the manly&#xD;
strength is written all over your face, though 'tis rather red or&#xD;
so still."&#xD;
"Sun and wind, Ollam Folda. You did not believe me that&#xD;
day on the hill, when.I told you so."&#xD;
"I was very rude that time, sir," she replied,laughing'; " but&#xD;
I'd not me fine school.manners then. I know better now than&#xD;
to say such truths, Mr. Vedder ; and, -sir, I do so want to&#xD;
graduate with these young ladies, Miss Bradshaw and' Miss&#xD;
Pelican -- I like her. She's as frank and outspoken as an&#xD;
O'Rouke, and 'tis my white angel's class ; I am sure she'd say&#xD;
I could do it."&#xD;
"Impossible, Sonsie ! smuggle four years into three, and you&#xD;
such a novice.&#xD;
" Yes, sir, I know that quite well, but I can work. Look at&#xD;
me face ; isn't 'it healthy. See, 1im as straight as an arrow. I&#xD;
never neglect me exercise. I take good care of me body, and&#xD;
I do wish it with all me soul."&#xD;
"Buts I cannot 'consent that you should kill yourself, and&#xD;
proud as you are of your=abundant vitality and perfect health,&#xD;
you will find that you can use them up. I'm your guardlan now,&#xD;
you know. 'My mother has appointed me to lodkafter you; as&#xD;
long as you  re her ward, and I shall be held responsible if&#xD;
any thing bef ls you."&#xD;
" Nothing 'ill, Mr. Vedder.  I'mabundantly ableindeed."'&#xD;
Jan opposed her wishes till her2 blue 'eyesnegan tos deepen&#xD;
and fill, and then he agreed to take the subject to Professor&#xD;

Noble, and they set off in search of him. They had along talk,&#xD;
the upshot of which was, -&#xD;
" She's a rare scholar, Mr. Vedder ; for besides being quick&#xD;
and ready, she's a digger, and if she has constitution enough to&#xD;
stand the hard work, she'll do it, and with credit :too."&#xD;
Jan hardly knew what to think of his visit. Sonsie had come&#xD;
much nearer to him in these six months, and yet she was&#xD;
farther off than ever; and when she got out her map of Ireland,&#xD;
and made him study up Ulster county, and dilated enthusiastic.&#xD;
ally upon the school she would have, there in the old place,&#xD;
and the music she would teach, and the needle-work, and the&#xD;
housekeeping, he felt almost sure that the only way to get her&#xD;
for his wife would be to go out a missionary, in which case he&#xD;
might be useful in furtherance of her plans. After he was gone,&#xD;
Sonsie missed him, and she paused in her tasks to think about&#xD;
him, and she put carefully away a little pen-knife he had left&#xD;
upon her desk, after pointing a lead-pencil for her, and also&#xD;
a handkerchief, marked ".Jan Vedder." She did not give it&#xD;
out to the wash, but folded it carefully, and patted it, and it&#xD;
needed washing too, for there was a crimson stain on it, of his&#xD;
blood, from a cut he had made in his thumb while working for&#xD;
her, and she pondered Christabel Groenveldt's estimate of a lady,&#xD;
-- "truth, purity, culture "-and =so on, and compared herself&#xD;
with others, and measured, herself by the standard which had&#xD;
always been peerless with her -- "the white Angel"--and she&#xD;
watched carefully, and tirelessly fought the treacherous idioms,&#xD;
which were her rock ahead on her road to perfection. -&#xD;
Six monthsmore filtered away, and Jan. was coming again.&#xD;
Sabrina went into Sonsie's room, and found her sitting on the&#xD;
floor, with her apron over her head. She pulled :it down, and&#xD;
got a view of a hot, disturbed face..&#xD;
"'~ What's the matter, Sonsie ?" iL&#xD;
&#xD;
PRDE AND POVERTY, AND SONSIE.           523&#xD;
"It's a struggle between me pride and me poverty," ex-&#xD;
claimed the maid.&#xD;
" How is that, dear. I don't understand."&#xD;
" Oh, Miss Sabrina, I'm afraid I shall have to put on one of&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder's dresses in spite of meself; look at the darns of&#xD;
we !"&#xD;
" Certainly, my dear girl; of course you will. I have been&#xD;
waiting for you to see it so, and I felt sure you would work out&#xD;
clearly the proprieties of the case in your own time. You cer-&#xD;
tainly owe it to Jan Vedder, the best-friend you have in the&#xD;
world, to appear your nicest when he comes to visit you."&#xD;
"But, oh dear, Miss Sabrina."&#xD;
"Well, what now ? You sit in dust and ashes, but you&#xD;
lament, like Ezekiel, on the hill-top."&#xD;
" Don't you see, dear young lady, that I'd be putting meself&#xD;
under such fresh obligations if I-did; and don't think ill of me&#xD;
-please don't -but I'm awful proud.'&#xD;
"It would be a terrible blow if Mr. Vedder should ask you&#xD;
to marry him, I suppose, some fine day."&#xD;
"They are gentlefolks, and I am Sonsie Eagan !"  She was&#xD;
standing in her old attitude, and. looking at Sabrina over her&#xD;
shoulder, and her blue eyes deepened to rikhest violet. " And&#xD;
I've made all me plans to go-to Ireland and be a teacher."&#xD;
" That's nonsense, Sonsie l headstrong nonsense ! There is&#xD;
plenty of work for you to do here, among your own people,&#xD;
too, Don't you love Jan Vedder ?"&#xD;
"He's a handsome, well-contrived gentleman, and almost a&#xD;
Providence to me, and - but I don't love him for a husband ;&#xD;
at least, I don't inean .to, and I don't believe I. do. I never&#xD;
think of him and me in the one breath. I've always kept me&#xD;
independence good and clear, as far as I was able."&#xD;
"You are quite worthy to be Mr. Vedder'stwife, 'Sonsie. I&#xD;
hope you will be. I could look forward to long years of de-&#xD;

lightful intercourse with you as a neighbor. I am sure you will&#xD;
be a useful woman anywhere, and where so useful as wife to a&#xD;
splendid fellow, who has loved you so long and so faithfully."&#xD;
" Miss ,Bradshaw, I-thought you and Mr. Jan a fine couple,&#xD;
the day ye walked up the broad aisle at Miss Zoe's wedding,"&#xD;
said Sonsie, who was more deeply moved than she desired to&#xD;
appear.&#xD;
"Did you? Well, I believe we were a presentable party,&#xD;
Chris never looked so handsome but once, and that was when&#xD;
she came riding up to the little chapel, in her suit of ancient&#xD;
cut, and her bidegroom by her side. Oh yes, Jan and I looked&#xD;
nicely that day  i remember thinking so myself."&#xD;
"I didn't know but ye might stand by that altar, wid yer two&#xD;
hands joined."&#xD;
"Me, Sonsie! and Jan Vedder! Oh no. I shall be a free.&#xD;
woman all my life, I think, Sonsie  but come, let us unlock&#xD;
the trunk and see what you will wear."'&#xD;
Very reluctantly Sonsie -complied, and, Sabrina selected a&#xD;
black silk, and when the Celtic maiden was robed therein, the&#xD;
young lady took good care not to show the admiration she felt,&#xD;
lest she should alarm Sonsie's pride, and o  her labor; but&#xD;
really her comeliness was perfect, and she looked the lady'too,&#xD;
with her magnificent hair, her shapely hands andfeet; and her&#xD;
motions, though.brisk and positive, were supple and.harmoni-&#xD;
ouslygraceful.&#xD;
" Come- down now, directly, dear," said Sabrina, hasting&#xD;
away to dress.&#xD;
They waited a little while in the library, and, began to won-&#xD;
der that Sonsie did not appear, when they heard her quick foot.-&#xD;
steps, and she entered with her head'up, her cheeks flaming,&#xD;
and clothed in her faded gingham.&#xD;
Sabrina was terribly yezed; but Jan rose eagerly and cour.&#xD;
teously to greet her,.&#xD;
&#xD;
PRIDE AND POVERTY, AND SONSIE.           525&#xD;
.I am the bearer of a message and a commission to. you,&#xD;
Sonsie. I begged the pleasure of coming, from Judge Sistaire,&#xD;
who has irtuted mewith acopy of Deacon Williams's will, and&#xD;
he desires me to-infotmyou, that you are inheriter of Mary,.&#xD;
Ann's portion of his estate, and also of the share which should&#xD;
have belonged to poor Bax, by. special request of the brother&#xD;
and sister, whose joint wishes he took the utmost pleasure in&#xD;
carrying out; so that I congratulate you upon being absolute&#xD;
mistress of fifty thousand dollars."&#xD;
Sonsie sat down breathless, "'Tis the merciful goodness of&#xD;
the dear Christ, who puts it into the hearts of me two friends&#xD;
to give me back nme independence," said she presently. " Now&#xD;
I can repay all the money I've cost your mother, and be me&#xD;
own free girl once more. .Oh, you don't know how good it&#xD;
feels! Dear' Miss Mary and Bat! 'Ah, ye truly loved me,&#xD;
then ! did ye not?"&#xD;
Sonsie slipped out after a little, and in an incredible space of&#xD;
time she returned, and Jan, highly as he thought of her beauty,&#xD;
was astonished 'at it, in his mother's black;silk and lace collar.&#xD;
The girl was all fervor and fire.- " I am glad it was you- who&#xD;
brought me the gift, Mr. Vedder," said she, with both hands out.&#xD;
" I could not have liked it from the 'lips of another body half so&#xD;
well. Youhave always beensuch a friend to me."&#xD;
"Thanks, Sonsie; and also for this," touching lightly her robe.&#xD;
" My dear mother's kindness is' too true and real to be de.&#xD;
spised. Yoi are a good girl, an I feel sure you *ill ake vise&#xD;
use of your. fortune ; and now,in this attire, I dare prefer a re-&#xD;

sends her kind dishes, and desires you toy spend the 1g=vaca-&#xD;

&#xD;
grandly, gloriously accepted her position, and nobly-filled it, and&#xD;
when, after a day at Brookedge, Mrs. Vedder said,-&#xD;
" Now, Sonsie, you are a rich heiress, and have paid me all&#xD;
off-.every dime, with compound interest--now, will you&#xD;
come and be my daughter'?"&#xD;
The heart-full lassie took the jewelled hand extended to her,&#xD;
and kissed it. "My lovely little mother, teach me my duties,&#xD;
till I begin directly."&#xD;
Jan came in and surprised this tableau. "Congratulate me,&#xD;
my son," said the fairy matron slyly. "I've got a daughter.,&#xD;
Come and kiss her, and promise to be a good brother to her."&#xD;
"Not any sister for me, thank you, mother; but I'll tell you&#xD;
what I will do, -I'll' be the best husband that ever the sun&#xD;
shone on, if Sonsie Eagan will take me."&#xD;
"And is that the way ye Dutch-Yankees make love," replied&#xD;
Sonsie, glowing. "I never thought I would let you ask me,&#xD;
sir, but since you've spoken the pretty words, and me mother&#xD;
wishes it, I'll. do me best  I always do. I'm getting a little&#xD;
out of that, you know- thank God and this sweet lady  and I,&#xD;
can bring ye truth and purity, and I'm striving for the culture,&#xD;
arid the purple blood. There's a dash of it in me veins. 'Twas&#xD;
NMiss Chris who taught me the makings of a real lady, and&#xD;
I love and prize you, Mr. Jan, beyond the whole world.&#xD;
There, how."&#xD;
Mrs. Vedder took her new daughter in her arms with a&#xD;
thankful heart,. and.Sorisie, all miles and tears, said, crisply,&#xD;
"And there goes me new independence, that:I butjust got&#xD;
the taste of, and I belong to the pair of ye intirely " .&#xD;
"Mamma, mamma, why don't the men propose," inquired.&#xD;
the green parrot. - "They do, you silly Polly,"-replied Mrs.&#xD;
Vedder, picking up the bird, who was doing her, best to be of&#xD;
the party, climbing her :iitress's;dress with beak andchlaws.&#xD;
"WPolly put -the kettle on, and we will all have tea," said&#xD;
&#xD;
Polly, ' in an ecstatic state of spread wings and orange-fiery&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Yes, Polly, so we will;, and you and I will go and order it,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Vedder here walking off and leaving her, son and&#xD;
daughter together.&#xD;
CHAPTER LII.&#xD;
THE MEETING ON THE ALPS.&#xD;
YOUNG couple, in Tyrolean costume, sat on a rude&#xD;
li bench before a Swiss chalet, to all appearance well-&#xD;
pleased with the delightful sunset and with each other.&#xD;
The lady had long brown curls, and great wistful eyes, and her&#xD;
companion, who smoked a pipe, was dark and grave. She&#xD;
was putting the last touches to a picture, which she held up&#xD;
for his inspection.&#xD;
" I can scarcely believe that we have been four years married,&#xD;
Otho," said she.&#xD;
"Thanks, Sapho. That compliments me, and yet they have&#xD;
been busy years, and full of variety. Your picture is admir-&#xD;
able. It surpasses the high expectation I had on that 2oth of&#xD;
May, when you told me you must see foreign lands. You are&#xD;
fully entitled to the trifles I have faithfully kept for you; and&#xD;
now for the song. You have added to your instruments, even&#xD;
more than you looked to do that day. I think piano, violin,&#xD;
harp, and guitar will do for a lady. You are a rare woman-&#xD;
darling. I thought I knew all your graces and possibilities,&#xD;
but I had not dreamed the halfI find you ever fresh and ever&#xD;
new ; and, Chris, tell me truly, if you were back under the sun-&#xD;

THE MEETING ON THE ALPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Otho was an exacting man, but he was fully .satisfied with&#xD;
his wife's answer, and was still enjoying its flavor, when a little&#xD;
toddling beauty came up and rested her small hand on his knee&#xD;
-a brown-eyed, lovely creature, as like as possible to Chris&#xD;
in her childhood.&#xD;
"IPapa, see !" said she, pointing down the mountain with her&#xD;
baby finger.&#xD;
"iThey are here, darling," exclaimed he, rising ; " but we will&#xD;
have our song after the moon comes up. I will not be de-&#xD;
frauded of the pleasure I have patiently waited these four years&#xD;
for, even by these our dearest friends;"&#xD;
Ruth, and George, and Pigeon, and Uncle Alec, and Jan&#xD;
Vedder. A stately girl was leaning upon his arm, straight as&#xD;
an arrow, with a complexion of lilies and roses, whom the young&#xD;
fellow very proudly presented to ,octor and Mrs. Groenveldt&#xD;
as "my wife."  There was a rich twirl still to her tongue, but&#xD;
her English was of the choicest, and she had gotten all Chris's&#xD;
requisites now - " truth, .purity, culture, delicacy" -leaving&#xD;
nothing to be desired. She had seen Ireland - its palaces and&#xD;
shealings - and had a good deal to say about them. She had&#xD;
richly endowed a school in the old place, and waited long&#xD;
enough to see it prosperously working, and was satisfied to&#xD;
leave it, having found and taken her proper lace in the station&#xD;
she was formed to adorn. "Her price is far above rubies; the&#xD;
heart of her husband doth safely trust in her; she will do him&#xD;
good, and not evil, all the days of her life."&#xD;
