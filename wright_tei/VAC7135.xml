CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE TEMPLE-INTRODUCTION oF ONE oF&#xD;
OUR CHARAcTERs.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE Temple, London-there is some-&#xD;
thing venerable and antique about the&#xD;
very name; it awakens reminiscences&#xD;
of events totally unconnected with the&#xD;
present age ; it speaks of manners,&#xD;
customs, and institutions long passed&#xD;
away and extinct in the civilized&#xD;
world. Small patches of ancient Lon-&#xD;
don exist in divers localities; but these&#xD;
are fast dwindling into points, such as&#xD;
single houses, old church-towers,- and&#xD;
crumbling walls. The Temple exhi-&#xD;
bits still a fair" assemblage of build-&#xD;
ings on which rests the shadow of days&#xD;
long departed. We do not mean to&#xD;
assert that the firstedifices erected by&#xD;
the Knights Templars in 1184, when&#xD;
they removed hither from their house&#xD;
in Holborn, are now standing; the&#xD;
noble Round in the church, however,-&#xD;
where the prostrate effigies of the&#xD;
knights are seen slumbering in armor,&#xD;
dates back to that period. In ,1308&#xD;
ended the glory of the Order of the&#xD;
Knights Tenplars, for in that year&#xD;
Edward II., following the example of&#xD;
Philip the Fair of France, summarily&#xD;
arrested the half-warlike, half-religious&#xD;
brotherhood. William de la More, the&#xD;
last master in England, sighed over the,&#xD;
extinction of his - order and the confis-&#xD;
cation Qf its wealth. He was, never--&#xD;
theless, happy in not suffering death&#xD;
at the stake, like the grand master&#xD;
in France, whom the merciless Philip&#xD;
burned in an island of the Seine.,&#xD;
Shortly-after this event, the Temple&#xD;
was assigned over to the practitioners&#xD;
of the law, and it has remained, we&#xD;
2.&#xD;
&#xD;
scarcely need add, under their quiet&#xD;
jurisdiction to the present hour.&#xD;
The Temple has suffered much at&#xD;
various periods from fire, Wat Tyler's&#xD;
wanton conflagratio in the time of&#xD;
Richard II. being t e first, we believe,&#xD;
on record. Many houses, in conse-&#xD;
quence, of con  atively modern date,&#xD;
have sprung up; yet, in spite of the&#xD;
strange and diversified appearance of&#xD;
several -of the courts and ranges of&#xD;
building, where the spirit of the pre-&#xD;
sent seems mocking the spirit of the&#xD;
past, still, we repeat, Antiquity has&#xD;
made here a determined stand. Yes,&#xD;
Antiquity looks from the high-perched&#xD;
attics, gables, and sloping roofs; his&#xD;
broad face laughs out on the red-brick&#xD;
fronts; his -old shoulders support the&#xD;
round stone arches of many a passage&#xD;
and doorway leading to spiral stair-&#xD;
cases; he watches the elm-trees along&#xD;
King's Bench walk, so black, so wither-&#xD;
ed about the stout old trunks, yet bear-&#xD;
ing in summer fresh green leaves, like&#xD;
hopes- springing out of sorrow. lHe&#xD;
passes in scorn the modernized terrace&#xD;
and garden, but sits in pride on the&#xD;
ancient hall overlooking the splashing&#xD;
fountain; the turrets of that hall,&#xD;
crowned with crosses, seem limbs of&#xD;
his strength ; and the curiously stained&#xD;
windows, gleaming in the sunset, re-&#xD;
flect his purple smile.&#xD;
Ay, brave Antiquity, though droop-&#xD;
ing, mourning elsewhere, is strong and&#xD;
joyful here,; and let no cold, unimagi-&#xD;
native utilitarian, by pulling down, re-&#xD;
erecting, and "beautifying," destroy&#xD;
his pleasant dreams I-&#xD;
Should there be one among our&#xD;
readers who has never visited the time-&#xD;
honored abode of the Knights Tem-&#xD;
plars, we despair" of giving him any-&#xD;

on his face, approached Hartley. H~e ."M1y dear Roland-"&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
" I want not your sympathy-I need&#xD;
not your pity."&#xD;
"What can I do for you ?-how can&#xD;
I serve you ?  If you think yourself&#xD;
aggrieved-if it would at all advance&#xD;
your happiness-I freely,) gladly agree&#xD;
to make, over to you half my, estate."&#xD;
This generous proposal was no idle&#xD;
offer, spoken for the sake of effect.&#xD;
Somerset meant what he said.&#xD;
"Man, I am   no miser. I despise&#xD;
your wealth."&#xD;
"But we must not continue enemies.&#xD;
Something must be done to reconcile&#xD;
you to me. You are my only brother,&#xD;
and as such I must ever regard you&#xD;
with affection."&#xD;
"Pshaw !-you waste breath. Our&#xD;
paths in life are now in opposite direc-&#xD;
tions.  Leave me to myself.   Go-&#xD;
prolong not this interview."&#xD;
Hartley turned his back, and walked&#xD;
towards the window. He looked out&#xD;
upon the ground infront of the Temple,&#xD;
and, as if to evince his utter indifference,&#xD;
began to hum a tune. No anger, but&#xD;
anxiety and deep sorrow, were depicted&#xD;
on the countenance of the elder brother.&#xD;
" Hear me, Roland!-bear with me !"&#xD;
cried the flatter, laying his hand on&#xD;
Hartley's arm. "You still love Isa-&#xD;
bella; your heart bleeds. Oh! I can&#xD;
fully enter into your feelings ; I can&#xD;
imagine your distress !"&#xD;
"IDistress?" exclaimed Hartley, turn-&#xD;
ing sharply around, a fierceness in his&#xD;
accent which made the other start.&#xD;
"I have no distress ; and as for loving&#xD;
Isabella, the unworthy, the mad passion&#xD;
I once experienced, has passed into-&#xD;
another feelitig."&#xD;
Somerset was much relieved. He&#xD;
secretly rejoiced to think that his&#xD;
brother had achieved that ever-difficult&#xD;
victory-the conquest of self.&#xD;
"Right, -right !  I thought your&#xD;
strong mind; your excellent sense,-&#xD;
would' prevail. Your natural intel-&#xD;
lectual power, aided by your severe&#xD;
studies, places you far above myself,&#xD;
Roland, in controlling the inclinations,&#xD;
and bringing the' passions under the&#xD;
dominion of reason."&#xD;
"You are pleased to speak in enig-'&#xD;
mas: I am at a loss to understand what&#xD;
you aim at."&#xD;
"In plain language, then, for your-&#xD;
future peace and happiness, as well as&#xD;
for my own, I am not a little gratified&#xD;
at hearing you assert that your love-&#xD;
for Isabella has given- wauy to other&#xD;

feelings. Believe me, she esteems you&#xD;
as a friend-a dear friend ; and you&#xD;
have our mutual good wishes, our&#xD;
prayers, for your prosperity and happi-&#xD;
ness in life."&#xD;
Hartley turned slowly, and cast a&#xD;
withering glance at the speaker. His&#xD;
brow was gradually contracting ; his&#xD;
cheek was becoming momently more&#xD;
pale, and his limbs trembled. All gave&#xD;
evidence that he wasstruggling with&#xD;
some strong internal emotion-an.emo-&#xD;
tion he desired to veil, but which made&#xD;
itself apparent in spite of himself.&#xD;
" Listen to me !-understand mel"&#xD;
he exclaimed at length, in a deliberate&#xD;
measured tone ; but, as he proceeded,&#xD;
the words fell from him rapidly, and&#xD;
he spoke with vehemence. "I admit&#xD;
that my love for Isabella has ceased, is&#xD;
extinct ; but it has been succeeded, as&#xD;
I said, by another feeling. That feeling&#xD;
I cannot describe -to you: contempt&#xD;
and hatred are weak terms to represent&#xD;
the sentiment I now entertain for her.&#xD;
Her beauty to me seems but the beauty&#xD;
of a Hecate just risen from below.&#xD;
Her late iniagined virtues have all&#xD;
vanished. Oh, how could I have ever&#xD;
listened to that voice and deemed it&#xD;
music! The recollection of the tones,&#xD;
like horrible discord, grates on my&#xD;
memory; her image rises before me,&#xD;
foul, detested-"&#xD;
"Cease !" cried Somerset, seizing&#xD;
his brother's arm, and griping it with.&#xD;
a force that made him utter an in-&#xD;
voluntary cry.. " Speak not thus of&#xD;
the gentle being whom I am about to&#xD;
make my wife. I am bound to protect&#xD;
her from insult and slander as if I were&#xD;
already her husband."&#xD;
"Nay, I will neither insult nor&#xD;
slander her., I wish only to show you&#xD;
how my once tender feelings have been&#xD;
converted into something more than&#xD;
apathy. Her refusal has made me the&#xD;
man I am. Circumstances bind me in&#xD;
their iron chain. A short time since&#xD;
I could not conquer my lovb, and' now&#xD;
I cannot repress my hate. For your-&#xD;
self-" he paused an instant, dooped&#xD;
his eyes, and when he lifted the  again&#xD;
the late flaccid lids were drawn up,&#xD;
the pupils were distended, and they&#xD;
seemed full of that savage fire peculiar&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE MARRIAGE-DAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
WE must transport the reader to a&#xD;
quiet rural district in Norfolk, not far&#xD;
from the sea.&#xD;
The traveller, in passing through&#xD;
that fine. English county, cannot but&#xD;
have .observed .the numerous very an-&#xD;
cient villages which nestle in the valleys&#xD;
or dot the sides of the green hills. Each&#xD;
village boasts, like a heavenly protector,&#xD;
its old Norman or Saxon church. Some&#xD;
of these sacred edifices are entirely&#xD;
covered with ivy even to the summit of&#xD;
the square rude towers ; and the gazer&#xD;
beholds them with feelings of deep&#xD;
interest mingled with awe. Worship&#xD;
has been going forward within their&#xD;
&#xD;
as a brother no more, but a foe, whos&#xD;
death would not rejoice me, for then&#xD;
could not hope to behold you living is&#xD;
torture. You have won, the woman&#xD;
whose hand I likewise sought-go, we(&#xD;
her ; and ere you leave these rooms&#xD;
never to re-enter them, receive m)&#xD;
blessing on your approaching marriage&#xD;
or call it, if you like-my curse!'&#xD;
"May you continue to love you&#xD;
wife, dote on her, only to find her false&#xD;
May the nuptial pillow prove to both&#xD;
of you a pillow offthorns ! May you&#xD;
have children only to turn scorpions in&#xD;
your own bosoms ! May each fawning&#xD;
friend prove a traitor, and work you&#xD;
disgrace and ruin ! May the Heaven&#xD;
you place confidence in frown on you,&#xD;
and forsake you in your old. years!&#xD;
And may your last hour be-without&#xD;
hope !"&#xD;
While the unnatural brother pro-&#xD;
ceeded with his malediction, Somerset&#xD;
remained perfectly still, as if under the&#xD;
influence of.a spell. His feelings were&#xD;
harrowed, and his amiable nature was&#xD;
shocked. He now gradually, as without&#xD;
consciousness, moved backward, still&#xD;
gazing on the incensed and excited&#xD;
speaker, whose. every word fell like a&#xD;
drop of gall, or a spark of fire, on his&#xD;
heart. Overpowered at length, he sank&#xD;
into a chair, and, slowly bending down&#xD;
his head, covered his face with his&#xD;
hands. His breast heaved, his manly&#xD;
cheek was wet with tears, and he&#xD;
groaned audibly, " My brother! my&#xD;
brother !"7&#xD;
&#xD;
e walls generation after generation ; the&#xD;
I dead of a thousand years are gathered&#xD;
n around them. Empires have been over-&#xD;
n thrown, dynasties have been changed ;&#xD;
d but there they stand in lowliness and&#xD;
, quiet, speaking of rude and earlier&#xD;
y times, whose ill-recorded events are&#xD;
fading into fables, or utterly forgotten&#xD;
-breathing of God, and pointing with&#xD;
r their gray towers like finger-posts to&#xD;
! heaven.&#xD;
Over the hills that embosom one of&#xD;
these villages morning had just dawned.&#xD;
i It was a pleasant sight to watch the&#xD;
sun gradually ascending, as it were,&#xD;
from behind the sea, shooting up his&#xD;
divergent rays like ten thousand arrows&#xD;
of gold. His great broad disk at length&#xD;
! emerges from the brim of the waves,&#xD;
and ocean, like .an immense chalice,&#xD;
seems full of sparkling rosy wine.&#xD;
Higher yet he mounts above the float-&#xD;
ing vapors, and the gold changes to&#xD;
silver ; higher yet, and all is dazzling&#xD;
lustre.&#xD;
Beautiful, all-powerful sun! land-&#xD;
ward dreamy nature wakens up ; the&#xD;
hills throw  off their. night.robes of&#xD;
mists ; and the woods hail him with an&#xD;
anthem from the throats of countless&#xD;
rejoicing birds. He is an enemy to&#xD;
none but the fairies: they fly at his&#xD;
approach, and bury themselves in&#xD;

In the old Norfolk village the spar-&#xD;
rows had quitted their nests beneath&#xD;
the thatch, and the peasants their beds.&#xD;
Yet no husbandman, with scythe or&#xD;
spade, was seen trudging forth-no&#xD;
horse was harnessed to the plough, or&#xD;
bullock yoked to the wain. Is it the&#xD;
Sabbath-day ?-no. Are they oppress-&#xD;
ed with a sudden fit of idleness ?-we&#xD;
are bound to-deny it. The inhabitants&#xD;
of that hamlet were never more active,&#xD;
and never seemed more full of business.&#xD;
The foung girls were tripping here and&#xD;
there into the gardens, heaping their&#xD;
laps with flowers, and the old women&#xD;
were dressing the children in their&#xD;
best attire.   T&#xD;

clothed in a green garment of luxuri-&#xD;

&#xD;
designation of forehead: ascending,&#xD;
however, in an oblique fashion, it&#xD;
assisted in forming a remarkably lofty&#xD;
head, which might contain, within its&#xD;
spacious chambers, a sufficiency of&#xD;
brain to satisfy the most exacting&#xD;
phrenologist. That pyramidal or sugar-&#xD;
loaf shaped head was adorned with&#xD;
straggling tufts of red hair; his eye-&#xD;
brows, too, were red; and his small,&#xD;
narrow whiskers, projecting' like two&#xD;
claws along his cheeks, were of the&#xD;
same fiery hue. His mouth was wide,&#xD;
but perfectly straight, and, being dry&#xD;
as parchment, appeared to be exempt-&#xD;
ed from those natural adjuncts-lips.&#xD;
His nose was his best feature; it was&#xD;
large, and hooked like the eagle's beak,&#xD;
and completely saved the face from&#xD;
insipidity. , The  eyes, too, though&#xD;
small, were black and very brilliant.&#xD;
They were restless eyes, turning like&#xD;
beads of jet, and darting their quick&#xD;
rays in all directions, giving evidence&#xD;
that the soul, whose dictates they&#xD;
obeyed, was of remarkable activity.&#xD;
The impression produced by Mr.&#xD;
Pike's whole appearance seemed to be&#xD;
that he- was clever, crafty, daring-&#xD;
he might be a rogue, or he might be&#xD;
an honest man: his general conversa-&#xD;
tion, and the excellent sentiments&#xD;
which: he sometimes -expressed,~ led&#xD;
you to infer that his conscience was&#xD;
tender, and that he had a high regard&#xD;
for principles of integrity and 'virtue.&#xD;
The little lawyer, with hat in hand,&#xD;
bowed low to Mr. Hartley.. That&#xD;
gentleman received him with unusual&#xD;
urbanity, drew for him a chair, and&#xD;
pushed towards him the decanter of&#xD;
Madeira which stood on the table.&#xD;
Mr. Pike was not insensible of the&#xD;
courtesy, for he smiled blandly, as he&#xD;
placed his tall hat upon the floor near&#xD;
his chair. Yet he was not a man to be&#xD;
deceived by any one: in short, he knew&#xD;
the other intended asking of him some&#xD;
favor.&#xD;
After a few observations on ordinary&#xD;
matters, Mr. Hartley opened the busi-&#xD;
ness on° account of- which he had sum--&#xD;
moned the attorney to his chambers.,&#xD;
"I have known you, Mr. Pike, for&#xD;
several years.  We are pretty well&#xD;
acquainted, I believe, with each other's&#xD;
pursuits and position in life."&#xD;
" Well acquainted, certainly-very&#xD;
well," said the little man, who opened&#xD;
=r_    his round eyes, being rather puzzled,&#xD;
Sand also surprised, at this preamble.&#xD;
&#xD;
KJ?&#xD;
&#xD;
16&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have served me on more than&#xD;
one occasion, and I have paid you for&#xD;
it," said Hartley.&#xD;
"You ' have, sir ; and I am always&#xD;
thankful for any little business you&#xD;
may throw into my way. These are&#xD;
hard times, Mr. Hartley. It is very&#xD;
sad that people won't apply oftener to&#xD;
attorneys-that they begin to show a&#xD;
contemptfor the beautiful laws of this&#xD;
country, and will settle their own quar-&#xD;
rels. Ah ! I say, it is very sad." And&#xD;
Mr. Jeremiah Pike heaved a deep sigh.&#xD;
" Attend to me. We can benefit&#xD;
each other. I am assured of your&#xD;
ability and your expertness., Serve&#xD;
me faithfully, and I will make it worth&#xD;
your while.  I will not seek to bind&#xD;
you by any solemn promise, or any&#xD;
oath, to carry out my plans and never&#xD;
to betray me; for promises between&#xD;
man and rhan I regard as dust in the&#xD;
balance, chaff in the wind."&#xD;
" Say not so, Mr. Hartley.. Do not&#xD;
entertain so bad an opinion of human&#xD;
nature. I, at least, never violate a&#xD;
promise. My word, once given, is&#xD;
sacred. I would rather die than betray&#xD;
a trust."&#xD;
As he gave utterance to these ami-&#xD;
able sentiments, a deep solemnity&#xD;
shadowed Mr. Pike's long face, but on&#xD;
Hartley's lip played a cold, sneering&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"Far be it from me, Mr. Pike, to cast&#xD;
a doubt on your good faith.or integrity;&#xD;
yet I confess I would rather bind you&#xD;
by the strong chain whose links extend&#xD;
from the prince on his throne to the&#xD;
beggar on his dunghill-self-interest.&#xD;
I would so arrange matters that, while&#xD;
serving me, you should serve yourself.&#xD;
Pray, may I ask what you usually&#xD;
make per annum by your profession ?'&#xD;
Pike turned uneasily in his chair,.&#xD;
scratched one of, his red eyebrows,&#xD;
then the tip of his large .ear.; looked&#xD;
steadfastly on the floor, as if examin-&#xD;
ing the patterns of the carpet,.coughed,&#xD;
again glanced up, and shook his head&#xD;
sorrowfully at the decanter of Madeira.&#xD;
" Your question is rather personal&#xD;
-rather awkward, Mr. Hartley.; How-&#xD;
ever, since, a close connection, it, ap-&#xD;
pears, is to be established between us,&#xD;
of course I willhide nothing from you.&#xD;

ther, being dead, and having no rela-&#xD;
tions, except a few very distant ones,&#xD;
the brothers were almost alone in the&#xD;
world, the last representatives of their&#xD;
line. Their estrangement from each&#xD;
other, therefore, was the more to be&#xD;
regretted, for the enmity, though it ex-&#xD;
isted on one side only, did not the less&#xD;
form an insurmountable barrier be-&#xD;
tween them.&#xD;
Brookland Hall was a venerable-&#xD;
looking pile. Built in the early part&#xD;
of the reign of James I., it displayed&#xD;
the architectural peculiarities which&#xD;
distinguished the mansions erected in&#xD;
the reign cif his predecessor. So mark-&#xD;
ed, indeed, was the character which&#xD;
the domestic architecture of Elizabeth's&#xD;
time assumed, that the style has ac-&#xD;
quired for itself a fixed designation:&#xD;
namely, the Elizabethan.&#xD;
The, building occupied three sides of&#xD;
a quadrangle; it was low, compact,&#xD;
but of considerable dimensions. The&#xD;
red brick, of which material mansions&#xD;
of the period were almost invariably&#xD;
composed, was relieved by white stone&#xD;
buttresses and raised facings, tech-&#xD;
nically termed quoins, at the angles of&#xD;
the walls. A low balustrade, marking&#xD;
a later date of erection, ran along the&#xD;
edge of the roof, which was also adorn-&#xD;
ed at the corners with - large - and&#xD;
quaintly-carved urns. A clock-tower,&#xD;
surmountedby a metal vane, rose above&#xD;
the centre of the building. Such a&#xD;
tower might now be thought a disfigure-&#xD;
ment, but in ancient days it was re-&#xD;
garded as yielding dignity to the main&#xD;
portion, and harmonizing with the ad-&#xD;
vancing wings.&#xD;
The front windows, having been&#xD;
somewhat modernized, were square;&#xD;
the others displayed the narrow Tudor&#xD;
arch, having strong stone mullions and&#xD;
diamond-shaped panes.. The principal&#xD;
doorway was of massy oak, the posts&#xD;
and lintel being elaborately carved.&#xD;
The portico, round on the -summit and&#xD;
of stone-work, was- supported by four&#xD;
Tuscan pillars, which had been origi-&#xD;
nally cased with marble. A lofty and&#xD;
handsome pediment, gave almost an&#xD;
air of majesty to this antique entrance.&#xD;
In truth, the pediment had long been&#xD;
an object of admiration ; and it was&#xD;
evidently the work of a classic hand,&#xD;
for the tympanum, or inclosure within&#xD;
its sides, was filled with figures carved&#xD;
in high relief, and of exquisite work-&#xD;
manship.&#xD;

AN OLD ELIZABETHAN MANSION-THE&#xD;
FIRST-BORN.&#xD;
MR. SoMERsET'S seat in Norfolk was&#xD;
situated in the windings of a beauti-&#xD;
fully wooded valley, a few miles from&#xD;
the sea-coast. He possessed Brookland&#xD;
Hall and the domain attached by right&#xD;
of his mother, who had been sole heir-&#xD;
ess of that very ancient property. As&#xD;
we have already stated, the lady had&#xD;
one child by her second marriage, Ro-&#xD;
land Hartley, and who was amply pro-&#xD;
vided for.    -&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER.SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
The terrace in front of Brooklan&#xD;
Hall, and the gardens beyond, ha&#xD;
,nothing about them of the quaint Eli&#xD;
zabethan era. They were essentially&#xD;
Italian. Long lines of white balus&#xD;
trades, ornamented with balls and ston&#xD;
rosettes ; huge vases at every corner&#xD;
and statues on tall pedestals ; broa&#xD;
flights of steps, flanked also by balus&#xD;
ters, leading from the terrace to the&#xD;
parterre below; ponds with little green&#xD;
islands, the last being adorned with&#xD;
summer-houses or grottos of spar-al&#xD;
betrayed a southern taste. The park&#xD;
which was extensive, swept away in&#xD;
gentle wave-like undulations, until the&#xD;
opening country -nearly lost the ch'a&#xD;
racter of a valley. A small brook, from&#xD;
which the manor took its name, divided&#xD;
the park, and over this stream several&#xD;
rustic wooden bridges were thrown.&#xD;
The trees, dispersed in groups, were&#xD;
principally sycamore and oak, some of&#xD;
them being of gigantic size and of ex-&#xD;
treme age. Herds of deer, drinking at&#xD;
the brook, or standing on the green&#xD;
knolls in relief against the sky, gave&#xD;
animation to the picture.&#xD;
Hugh Somerset, at the time this chap-&#xD;
ter -pens, was alone in his library.&#xD;
He stood at the window which over-&#xD;
looked the park. -Great anxiety was&#xD;
depicted in his countenance, and yet&#xD;
his face strangely expressed the coun-&#xD;
ter feeling of pleasure. That his mind&#xD;
was much disturbed appeared evident&#xD;
from his gestures and his incessantly&#xD;
moving from place to place. Now he&#xD;
turned hurriedly, from  the window,&#xD;
caught up a book, flung it down again ;&#xD;
next he threw himself into his great&#xD;
morocco-covered chair, and, looking at&#xD;
the door, which stood ajar, intently&#xD;
listened. A low cry was heard as of&#xD;
some person in extreme pain; it ceased,&#xD;
and again the voice of suffering fell on&#xD;
the ear- more distinctly.&#xD;
The face of Sonerset changed, and&#xD;
the moving muscles, especially the&#xD;
tremulous motion of the lips, evinced&#xD;
how strongly -those sounds jarred on&#xD;
his feelings, and excited his sympathy.&#xD;
He now clasped his hands, and seemed&#xD;
absorbedin prayer. -The husband pray-&#xD;
ing for the young wife that, Heaven&#xD;
would look down in mercy and love,&#xD;
support one so gentle and good through&#xD;
Nature's trial, and lighten in this in-&#xD;
stance, if Eternal Justice could not&#xD;
suspend, the curse of Eve.&#xD;
The cries succeeded to each other&#xD;
&#xD;
d with shorter intermissions, and light&#xD;
d steps, as of agitation and fear, were&#xD;
- heard passing up and down the stair-&#xD;
y case. Somerset could support that&#xD;
- state of suspense no longer. He quit-&#xD;
e ted the library"on the ground-floor, and&#xD;
, ascended to the room communicating&#xD;
d with the chamber of his wife. His look&#xD;
- was now haggard, his limbs trembled,&#xD;
e and his accustomed presence of mind&#xD;
n was fast deserting him. To every in-&#xD;
quiry which he made, a whisper only&#xD;
l was returned or a slight motion of the&#xD;
, head.&#xD;
The sounds of pain ceased. It was&#xD;
a moment of intense anxiety. The sud-&#xD;
- den stillness might be a sign of'good,&#xD;
or it might forebode ill.&#xD;
He was proceeding towards the room,&#xD;
l with an intention of entering'it, in&#xD;
spite of the injunctions previously given&#xD;
hinwhen he was met by the medical&#xD;
f man. The good doctor placed his fin-&#xD;
ger on his lip, but Somerset beheld&#xD;
only the quiet smile which covered his&#xD;
face, and read there in an instant all.&#xD;
he was so desirous of being assured of.&#xD;
She lives! the worst is over! and a&#xD;
child is born into the world !&#xD;
How many myriads of fond hearts&#xD;
this announcement has caused to beat&#xD;
wildly with joy!&#xD;
Somerset seized and wrung the doc-&#xD;
tor's hand, unable himself to ask any&#xD;
questions, or even to speak.&#xD;
"I congratulate you, sir; your wife&#xD;
is doing well," said the kind-hearted ac-&#xD;
coucheur. "Ah! Mr. Somerset, she&#xD;
has borne her trinl with wonderful&#xD;
fortitude-patient as an angel. r She&#xD;
often called for you, sir, wishing to see&#xD;
her husband ; but of course that could&#xD;
not be allowed-of course not."&#xD;
And again Mr. Somerset shook the&#xD;
doctor's hand ; but while he was ask-&#xD;
ing permission now to enter the cham-&#xD;
ber, an elderly woman appeared at the&#xD;
door.aShe bore something in heraarms&#xD;
swathed in a dozen flannels and inde-&#xD;
scribable wrappers. Approaching the&#xD;
master of the house with a courtesy, she&#xD;
presented to him, in accordance with&#xD;
the nurse's practice, the little stran-&#xD;
ger.&#xD;
Somerset received it with the awk-&#xD;
wardlness of a man to whom such family&#xD;
affairs are a novelty, but with a heart&#xD;
brtniming over with-joy and gratitude.&#xD;
A profound silence=ensued for a mo-&#xD;
ment. A tear trembled in the- eye&#xD;
of the agitated father ; -iui-ing that&#xD;
&#xD;
silence, Somerset invoked mentally a&#xD;
blessing on his first-born daughter.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
A DARING AND CRIMINAL ACTION.&#xD;
Two months had barely elapsed from&#xD;
the birth of Somerset's child, when a&#xD;
man in a light vehicle, which we may&#xD;
term a gig, put up at an obscure, host-&#xD;
elry on a rather solitary road in Norfolk.&#xD;
He stated that he had travelled from&#xD;
Wells, although in reality he had come&#xD;
in an opposite direction-from London.&#xD;
His name, he said, was Smith--a name&#xD;
so abounding in all places, that very&#xD;
probably the good publican had usually&#xD;
a dozen customers called Smith within&#xD;
a week. . Why the gentleman should&#xD;
have had recourse to these fabrications,&#xD;
a satisfactory reason no doubt existed;&#xD;
but we, who are well acquainted with&#xD;
his person, at once pronounce the&#xD;
counterfeit Smith to be Pike: yes, the&#xD;
little active frame, the sugar-loaf shap-&#xD;
ed head, the great eagle nose, and the&#xD;
round lyilliant sloe eye, could be Jere-&#xD;
miah Pike's nose, head, and eyes, and&#xD;
no other man's.&#xD;
Heintended ,to drive out in his gig&#xD;
every morning, his business being, as&#xD;
he affirmed, to collect small bills for the&#xD;
Wells merchant who employed him.&#xD;
The task might occupy him two days&#xD;
or double that time, the farmers who&#xD;
owed the money living widely apart.&#xD;
All this was very probable.. The pub--&#xD;
lican respected commercial men; so he&#xD;
provided everything very comfortable,&#xD;
and Mr. Smith was to pay his reckon-&#xD;
ing punctually each- day before starting&#xD;
on- his rounds.&#xD;
We. view Mr. Pike, for we must call&#xD;
him by his' proper name, busy at his&#xD;
breakfast the first morning of his arri-&#xD;
val. 'He occupied a private room.' His&#xD;
appetite was usually keen even to vora-&#xD;
ciousness ; but on the present occasion&#xD;
some secret anxiety appeared entirely&#xD;
to have -destroyed his relish. for good&#xD;
things. Indeed,, he ate every morsel&#xD;
much like a man who fears being&#xD;
choked.&#xD;
3 Havingbeen satisfied with his scanty&#xD;
repast, he drew from his side-pocket a&#xD;
liteIndian' rubber bottle, and began&#xD;
to.pour into it some new milk. While&#xD;
roring with the process of " fill-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing," Mr. Pike whispered to himself,&#xD;
but in tones so low that no ear but a.&#xD;
fairy's might have caught the words.&#xD;
"Nay, nay, whatever Hartley may&#xD;
urge, I'll never do that. I'll riot have&#xD;
the memory of a murder pressing on&#xD;
my soul. My nature is too humane,&#xD;
and endowed with principles too noble&#xD;
for an assassin. So, this will keep life&#xD;
in the babe until we reach town.- I&#xD;
think I shall make a tolerable nurse--&#xD;
hal ha! Twist the innocent's neck?&#xD;
Never ! Yet if it will die through the&#xD;
moving, after all my exertions, it can-&#xD;
not be helped." A smile, that sought&#xD;
to express the soul's rectitude and&#xD;
mercy, flitted across the lean visage of&#xD;
the little attorney of St. Mary Axe ;&#xD;
and with that smile fixed on his face,&#xD;
he bade the landlord good-day, and set&#xD;
forth in his gig.&#xD;
The horse, a docile, but a remarka-&#xD;
bly strong and fleet animal, was driven&#xD;
in the direction of Brookland Hall, that&#xD;
place being situated at a considerable&#xD;
distance. When, however, Pike ar-&#xD;
rived within three miles of Mr. Somer-&#xD;
set's house, he alighted, and left his&#xD;
horse and vehicle in the court-yard of&#xD;
a pothouse. Here, again, he thought&#xD;
proper- to have recourse to falsehood.&#xD;
He boldly informed the hostler that he&#xD;
was on the look-out for smugglers, and&#xD;
probably should be absent for some&#xD;
hours. Meantime, his horse must re-&#xD;
main feeding in the harness, since he&#xD;
should want his gig the instant he.re-&#xD;
turned, his business requiring the ut-&#xD;
most dispatch. Five shillings made&#xD;
the hostler very courteous, and fully&#xD;
convinced him, in his simplicity, that&#xD;
the liberal gentleman was indeed a&#xD;
government officer.&#xD;
The active attorney,' now on foot,&#xD;
soon reached byta circuitous route the&#xD;
thick wood which bounded Brookland&#xD;
Hall towards the north. He was soon&#xD;
lost amidstitsshades; butwell acquaint-&#xD;
ed with the ground by hpreviousrecon-&#xD;
notehe passed through" the tail trees,&#xD;
and threaded the brushwood, entertain-&#xD;
ing no fearof losing his way. At last&#xD;
hefound himself on the confines of the&#xD;
park, and springinginto the deep turf&#xD;
ditch or fosse, which extended outside&#xD;
the palings, was completely concealed.&#xD;
Whatever Mr. Pike's object might&#xD;
have been, he approached the house-as&#xD;
near as possible without incurring the&#xD;
risk of discovery. The hall was now&#xD;
within a quarter of a mile, when, with&#xD;

2pv&#xD;
&#xD;
his hat off, peering over the edge of&#xD;
the fosse, he seemed to consider his posi-&#xD;
tion an eligible one. Accordingly, tak-&#xD;
ing out, his handkerchief, he spread it&#xD;
on the turf at the bottom of the ditch,&#xD;
and sat down to-watch!&#xD;
It was about eleven o'clock in the&#xD;
forenoon, and the slight mist which&#xD;
had obscured the morning gradually&#xD;
cleared away. From his hiding-place&#xD;
Pike could see the entrance-door of the&#xD;
hall ; the garden, too, in front, with its&#xD;
winding gravel walks, was entirely&#xD;
commanded by his eye, while a narrow&#xD;
footway, leading down the park, swept&#xD;
not more than twenty yards from the&#xD;
place where he sat.&#xD;
Often rising and creeping up the&#xD;
bank, and casting around him his little&#xD;
brilliant eyes, then returning to his&#xD;
station, frowning and muttering, Mr.&#xD;
Pike was evidently in a state of much,&#xD;
perturbation.&#xD;
To any one who could have seen him&#xD;
there, he had offered a singular specta-&#xD;
cle. From the nature of his low seat&#xD;
he was obliged to bend forward, his&#xD;
hands resting on his knees, so that his&#xD;
body, being nearly doubled,-formed an&#xD;
acute angle. Those hands, in their&#xD;
long skinny length, resembled - claws&#xD;
rather than human members. Having&#xD;
forgotten in his excitement to place&#xD;
on his hat, his red matted hair fell&#xD;
from his high-crowned head, covering&#xD;
his low, flat forehead nearly to his eyes ;&#xD;
the last, incessantly turning about, and&#xD;
never winking, burned like sparks of&#xD;
fire. His old brown garments were&#xD;
drawn closely around him, and the&#xD;
thick pendent branches of trees, waving&#xD;
-above his head, invested him in their&#xD;
deep shadows. Such a figure, seen in&#xD;
a tropical climate, would have suggested&#xD;
but one idea: the traveller would have&#xD;
thought him an orang-outang.&#xD;
Between his risings up- and sittings&#xD;
down, Mr. Pike held a running dia-&#xD;
logue with himself, the object of which.&#xD;
seemed chiefly to be the quieting'of his&#xD;
conscience, and the setting forth of cer-&#xD;
tain arguments in justification of his&#xD;
conduct.&#xD;
"Does Mr. Hartley act wrong? No&#xD;
doubt of it, very wrong. His motive&#xD;
is black revenge, unnatural black re-&#xD;
venge. Am I right in assisting him?&#xD;
I think I am. If I refused to do his&#xD;
business, some other party would be&#xD;
sure to undertake it for that three hun-&#xD;
dred a year ; some scoundrel perhaps|&#xD;
&#xD;
-some unprincipled, hard-hearted vil-&#xD;
lain-who would even more than carry&#xD;
out Hartley's orders. Now I, yes I,&#xD;
will blunt the edge of his hatred, and&#xD;
temper each act with mercy. Any one&#xD;
else, no doubt, would murder this child,&#xD;
but I will be its preserver ; it shall not&#xD;
perish. Ah ! who knows"-he had be-&#xD;
gun to.nibble at a biscuit, for he, felt&#xD;
hungry-" who knows but I shall be&#xD;
even doing Mr. Somerset's child an&#xD;
essential service ? If left here, sur-&#xD;
rounded by superfluities and luxuries,&#xD;
very probably she would grow up proud,&#xD;
haughty, and even vi'cious-ay, repro-&#xD;
bate in this life and lost in the next.&#xD;
Now, by carrying her off from the scene&#xD;
of temptation, and dropping the babe&#xD;
at that -    workhouse, she may be-&#xD;
come hereafter a good, modest, virtuous&#xD;
servant, marry an honest-laborer, and&#xD;
be loved, respected, and happy."&#xD;
Pike was not altogether a hypocrite,-&#xD;
but one of the large -family of casuists&#xD;
and deluded quieters of conscience. A&#xD;
placid, self-approving smile was dif-&#xD;
fused over his countenance. He was&#xD;
charmed by the vision his fancy had&#xD;
conjured up-charmed by the idea of&#xD;
his own amiability. In short, he wish-&#xD;
ed to feel, while undertaking a mest&#xD;
criminal and cruel deed, how philan-&#xD;
thropic and merciful in reality he was.'&#xD;
But his biscuit, being finished, the&#xD;
little man took out his pinchbeck watch&#xD;
to consult the hour. - It was past one&#xD;
o'alock.. Again he peered cautiously&#xD;
over the brink-of the fosse. His quick&#xD;
eye perceived a female figure descend&#xD;
the steps of the terrace in front of the&#xD;
hall and enter the garden. She bore.&#xD;
something in her arms. It was the&#xD;
nurse with the -'child, taking the' ac-&#xD;
customed airing.&#xD;
Pike's eyes followed her motions like&#xD;
those of the boa-constrictor watching&#xD;
its prey. He was in a fever of expecta-&#xD;
tion and eagerness.&#xD;
Suddenly a cloud came over his face&#xD;
and he muttered an oath, for a serving-&#xD;
man made his appearance, and Mr. So-&#xD;
merset himself entered the garden,&#xD;
slowly walking, and reading' a book.&#xD;
" Nothing is to be done to-day, that's&#xD;
certain," said the little attorney, shak-&#xD;
ing his bony fist at Somerset in the dis-&#xD;
tance. " That scoundrel has balked me&#xD;
this time. Never mind ; I can wait."&#xD;
Turning away, he indignantly quit-&#xD;
ted his lurking-place, cast another&#xD;
glance at the party, again anathema-&#xD;
&#xD;
tized Somerset, and plunged into the&#xD;
shrubbery.I&#xD;
The following day saw- Mr. Pike at&#xD;
his post precisely in the same spot ; but,&#xD;
as fate would haveit, the weather being&#xD;
rather unfavorable, no one appeared.&#xD;
He was not, however, a man to be dis-&#xD;
heartened ; the spirit of Mr. Pike was&#xD;
essentially a persevering spirit. We&#xD;
find him accordingly for the fourth&#xD;
time in the character of government&#xD;
officer, leaving his horse and gig  the&#xD;
little pothouse ; for the fourth time&#xD;
ensconced in the deep ditch, watching&#xD;
and peering about as anxiously as ever,&#xD;
and at intervals sitting in the same&#xD;
posture, his lean body stooping for-&#xD;
wards, and his hands resting on his&#xD;
'knees.&#xD;
He had learnt that the master of&#xD;
Brogkland Hall would be absent that&#xD;
day on business, and therefore it was&#xD;
that his black eyes beamed doubly&#xD;
bright, and his heart leaped up within&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The weather was remarkably fine,&#xD;
the air being mild, and the sun warm&#xD;
and unclouded. All was propitious.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, the woman will venture&#xD;
out todayy" whispered Pike, "and per-&#xD;
hapsalone."&#xD;
His smile was no longer bland, but&#xD;
had something ghastly and diabolical&#xD;
in it. It was a sneer that would have&#xD;
made you shudder.&#xD;
He waited, and waited-counted by&#xD;
his watch the hours, the quarters, the&#xD;
minutes--looked and    ted himself,&#xD;
and looked again. H1~ restlessness&#xD;
and impatience increased every mo-&#xD;
ment, untilthe perspiration stood in&#xD;
large beads on his forehead.&#xD;
The birds were singing among the&#xD;
branches overhead, the deer were,&#xD;
standing in quiet groups in the park,&#xD;
and the old hall, half shaded by trees,&#xD;
and half in the sunshine, looked the&#xD;
image of repose. Ah! what a contrast&#xD;
to the calm scene was the tumult of&#xD;
feelings in that mans heart ! Here&#xD;
was serenity and beauty; there, strife,&#xD;
storm, deformity-here was paradise,&#xD;
there was hell. -&#xD;
The starting eyes of the watcher, as&#xD;
he looked out of the ditch, intimated&#xD;
that he perceived something. -A figure&#xD;
moved in the garden. He could not&#xD;
be deceived ; it was the woman with&#xD;
the child, and a young groom, or page,&#xD;
a stripling of fifteen years only, was&#xD;
with her.&#xD;
&#xD;
_ _ _&#xD;
&#xD;
Ji&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
22&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, man with the black, self-deceiv-&#xD;
ing soul ! thy time approaches. Somer-&#xD;
set is from home ; the invalid mother&#xD;
is confined to the house, and there,&#xD;
borne in careful but feeble arms to in-&#xD;
hale the sweet breath of heaven, comes&#xD;
the helpless, unconscious victim. Oh !&#xD;
guardian angels of innocence! will ye&#xD;
behold the foul deed done and make no&#xD;
effort to' avert the evil? or must ye,&#xD;
like mortals, yield to destiny, whose&#xD;
purposes are to be worked out?&#xD;
The stripling swung back the gate&#xD;
which opened into the park. They&#xD;
passed- through, and, lured by the&#xD;
beauty of the morning, the woman pro-&#xD;
ceeded slowly onwards with her charge.&#xD;
A path, we have observed, wound&#xD;
through the park, approaching in its&#xD;
serpentine course to within some twenty&#xD;
yards of Pike's hiding-place, A row&#xD;
of trees stood opposite to hiih, shading&#xD;
the footway, so that parties who walked&#xD;
beneath their low drooping branches&#xD;
would not be visible to gazers from the&#xD;
windows of the hall.&#xD;
Pike now hastily made his prepara-&#xD;
tions. He buttoned his garments close-&#xD;
ly about him, drew a small silk mask&#xD;
across the upper part of his face, to&#xD;
prevent the possibility of future re-&#xD;
cognition, and grasped firmly a short&#xD;
thick stick-short, for it was no more&#xD;
than three feet long, but it was knotty,&#xD;
and loaded at one end with lead.&#xD;
Would they enter the path just al-&#xD;
luded to and approach his lair? that&#xD;
was the question. The hideous spider&#xD;
had spread its net and was watching&#xD;
the unsuspectingfly. The tiger, crouch-&#xD;
ing amidst the jungle, meditated his&#xD;
deadly spring upon the defenceless&#xD;
antelope. Pike looked no longer the&#xD;
little' crafty, smiling- attorney of St.&#xD;
Mary Axe; his situation had converted&#xD;
him into a savage, a worse than beast&#xD;
of prey.&#xD;
He thought of the resistance which&#xD;
the young groom might possibly make,&#xD;
but the uneasy idea was instantly re-&#xD;
moved by a glance at his heavy stick.&#xD;
Everything like fear was merged in&#xD;
wild and anxious- expectation. His&#xD;
nerves seemed strung by a supernatural&#xD;
energy. In a word, he felt himself&#xD;
equal to the undertaking.&#xD;
The youth ard the female bearing&#xD;
the child had entered the path. They&#xD;
approach nearer and nearer. Fearful&#xD;
was the excitement manifested by hin.&#xD;
who watched them; each limb trem-&#xD;

bled ; every muscle, in its . quivering&#xD;
action, sympathized with the intense&#xD;
eagerness of the spirit. His red hair&#xD;
bristled, his yellow teeth, like fangs,&#xD;
were apparent through his thin parted&#xD;
lips; his bony hand grasped the end&#xD;
of his stick, relaxed its hold, and again&#xD;
closed on the cudgel like the iron sides&#xD;
of a vice.&#xD;
Already Pike's glittering eyes mea-&#xD;
sured the distance between himself and&#xD;
his prey. Forty yards-thirty yards&#xD;
-closer still. When they have reach-&#xD;
ed the trees, and their backs are slightly&#xD;
turned from him, then must he bound&#xD;
upon them. The moment was come !&#xD;
Up from.the ditch he sprang-over the-&#xD;
palings, light as a wild-cat of the&#xD;
mountain, he leaped. His staff was&#xD;
raised in the air-it descended upon&#xD;
the head of the youth, who at once fell&#xD;
to the ground stunned. The woman&#xD;
had no time even to shriek, for she was&#xD;
struck down by the same formidable&#xD;
weapon. Then the assailant snatched&#xD;
the infant from her arms.&#xD;
The trees, by their hanging branches,&#xD;
hid the atrocious scene ; but Pike, to&#xD;
make certain that an alarm should not&#xD;
be raised too soon, and himself pur-&#xD;
sued before all traces of him might be&#xD;
lost in the neighborhood, struck the&#xD;
boy and the woman again on the tem-&#xD;
ples as they lay on the ground. In&#xD;
truth, his heavy cudgel did all but beat&#xD;
in their skulls. Self-preservation was&#xD;
the only plea our conscientious friend&#xD;
could urge for such cowardly and cruel&#xD;
conduct. But Pike tarried notto reason&#xD;
or philosophize now. The prize was&#xD;
won ; and his income of three hundred&#xD;
pounds a year was doubly assured to&#xD;
him.,&#xD;
Like an arrow from a bow, he darted&#xD;
with Somerset's child into the thick&#xD;
grove. Rapid must be the foot, and&#xD;
fleet even the steed, that would over-&#xD;
take the flying miscreant. The wild&#xD;
Indian, who on his native prairie out-&#xD;
strips the wind, might have found a&#xD;
rival in the lean and nervous dweller&#xD;
of the city of the civilized. In half an&#xD;
hour from that time, even before his&#xD;
victims had recovered from the stun-&#xD;
ning blows they had received, Pike was&#xD;
galloping off in his gig, urging his&#xD;
powerful horse to the top of his seed.&#xD;
His course was unhesitatingly and&#xD;
boldly directed towards the metropolis.&#xD;
He had taken his measures, arranging&#xD;
befopehand the places for feeding the&#xD;

Fox the first time since Hartley had*&#xD;
been refused the hand of the woman&#xD;
he once loved, pleasure was an inmate&#xD;
of his bosom. That pleasure might re-&#xD;
sult from the gratification of one of the&#xD;
worst passions incident to our nature ;&#xD;
yet the heart was not the less filled&#xD;
with a stern, bitter, and savage delight.&#xD;
"I thank you," he- said, addressing&#xD;
Mr. Pike, who had been communicat-&#xD;
ing to him the success attending his&#xD;
adventure in Norfolk ; "you have&#xD;
carried out my wishes in an admirable&#xD;
manner: you have indeed managed this&#xD;
affair with passing skill."1&#xD;
Mr. Pike Ming his head, as a man is&#xD;
wont do when applauded for some&#xD;
magnanimous action. He glanced out&#xD;
of the window, as if engaged in survey-&#xD;
ing the old trees, coughed, and brushed&#xD;
the top of his hat with- his brown&#xD;
sleeve.&#xD;
"And where is the child ?" asked&#xD;
Hartley, in a cautious -whisper. " Did&#xD;
the 'urried journey cause----"&#xD;
"Its death, you would add, sir. No,&#xD;
I am no murderer-thank Heaven ! my&#xD;
conscience is light. Itook due precau-&#xD;
tions. I fed it during the journey with&#xD;
milk-new, wholesome milk ; and now&#xD;
it is in the hands of a nurse."&#xD;
The countenance of Hartley assumed&#xD;
an expression of distrust and fear.&#xD;
"S'death ! Mr. Pike, can you depend&#xD;
on the party to whose charge you have&#xD;
consigned the infant? What if she&#xD;
should betray as?"&#xD;
"That's impossible.  She believes&#xD;
the poor innocent to be my-my-own&#xD;

you utter falsehoods, and heap on:me&#xD;
insults: as regards all else, I am entire-&#xD;
ly in. the dark."&#xD;
" Thou liest ! Roland Hartley. Thou&#xD;
art my brother-yet I say thou liest 1"&#xD;
The muscles about Hartley's mouth&#xD;
began to contract and his eye to dilate;&#xD;
but the fire of rage was instantly smo-&#xD;
thered, and gave place to a feeling ap-&#xD;
parently of intense sympathy.&#xD;
"I forgive you-I forgive-you this,&#xD;
language, supposing some terriblemis-&#xD;
understanding to exist on your part.,&#xD;
What is it? Inform me, Hugh, what&#xD;
is my crime?",&#xD;
"You have stolen my child!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Somerset, tightening his grasp&#xD;
on Hartley's collar. 1&#xD;
" Monstrous accusation I"&#xD;
"Oh I give me back my child," cried&#xD;
Mrs. Somerset, rushing forwards from&#xD;
her chair with frantic energy. " Do&#xD;
not deny you have taken it from'us-&#xD;
in pity do not! Say it is with you-&#xD;
say that it lives! Have mercy on a&#xD;
mother's breaking heart !"&#xD;
He whom she so ardently supplicated&#xD;
regarded her for a moment earnestly;&#xD;
but in silence. A light broke across&#xD;
his countenance ; it was not mockery,&#xD;
it was not pity, that strange unintelli-&#xD;
gible expression. The soul was in-&#xD;
wardly exulting, yet he- .dared not&#xD;
betray and lay bare its hidden springs.&#xD;
The woman who had rejected his suit,&#xD;
preferring another, was now a sup-&#xD;
pliant before him-now felt an agony&#xD;
it was in his power to relieve. He had&#xD;
suffered ; she in turn should suffer, and,&#xD;
if it were possible, tenfold as much as&#xD;
himself.      o&#xD;
" Madam, I entreat you, compose&#xD;
yourself and listen to reason.   I&#xD;
solemnly declare this is the first time&#xD;
I have heard of your loss. I forgive&#xD;
you your suspicions, your wild accusa-&#xD;
tions; perhaps they are natural. I am&#xD;
an unfortunate man  I bear the cha-&#xD;
racter of a harsh solitary ascetic; and&#xD;
untoward circumstances have unhap-&#xD;
ily made me my brother's enemy.&#xD;
In the first heat of your bereavement,&#xD;
then, to suspect me of being accessory&#xD;
to the - infamous act spoken of, is, I&#xD;
repeat, natural and excusable. But&#xD;
oh ! do me justice! do even an enemy&#xD;
who is candid, justice l I have made a&#xD;
confession of my faults which I cannot&#xD;
mend, and, of my bitterness which I&#xD;
cannot soften. Do not lay this atro-&#xD;
-cious deed to my charge. If, however,&#xD;
&#xD;
you wish to be revenged on me-to&#xD;
make the iron enter my soul beyond&#xD;
the pangs I have already endured-&#xD;
then indeed .you will persevere in call-&#xD;
ing me the purloiner of your child."&#xD;
The subdued manner, the mournful&#xD;
look and voice of Hartley, were emi-&#xD;
nently calculated to mislead. What-&#xD;
ever his acknowledged errors might&#xD;
be, a person listening to him might&#xD;
well be induced to acquit him of hy-&#xD;
pocrisy and falsehood. -Somerset, up-&#xD;
right and honorable himself, was ever -&#xD;
ready to view the bright side of human&#xD;
nature. He was a man easily moved&#xD;
and easily persuaded. He had, in re-&#xD;
ality, no direct proof to substantiate&#xD;
the charge, being influenced merely by&#xD;
strong suspicion. That Hartley had&#xD;
made an impression on him was evi-&#xD;
dent ; and the wavering state of his&#xD;
opinion might have been read-in the&#xD;
comparatively mild look with which&#xD;
he now regarded his brother, and the&#xD;
glance of surprise he cast on his wife.&#xD;
" Why, Roland, who but yourself&#xD;
.could have had a motive in taking the&#xD;
child? We have, hurried to London,&#xD;
fully persuaded of your guilt ; but if&#xD;
-if, indeed, you are innocent, then&#xD;
Heaven forgive me for having accused&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"He is not innocent!" cried Mrs.&#xD;
Somerset; " of course he did not pur-&#xD;
loin the child himself, but he employed&#xD;
some villain to do it. Tell- me, Mr.&#xD;
Hartley, if this be not the truth. Oh !&#xD;
restore me my child ! On my knees I&#xD;
pray-with tears I beseech-inform me&#xD;
where it is,.and I will pardon you,-T&#xD;
will bless you !"   -&#xD;
The wretched mother had, indeed,&#xD;
fallen on her knees, wringing her hands,&#xD;
and sobbingwith unrestrained violence.&#xD;
Her pale and worn face was, yet paler&#xD;
from that agony which " bleaches the&#xD;
cheek" while it rends the heartstrings ;&#xD;
and- her disordered hair fell=over her&#xD;
bosom, wet with her tears.   :&#xD;
" This will not do," said Somerset,&#xD;
raising his- wife from the floor. "If&#xD;
Hartley be guilty, forgiveness is out of&#xD;
the question ; the law will transport&#xD;
the man hehas employed, and himself&#xD;
also; and if the infant has died, the&#xD;
gallows must be their portion. On the&#xD;
other hand, if my brother is innocent,&#xD;
we have to regret the wrong done him,&#xD;
and to upbraid ourselves for the pre-&#xD;
cipitancy with which we have acted."&#xD;
" Hugh I how shall: satisfy you?'"&#xD;
&#xD;
said the wily Hartley. "To prove t&#xD;
you how deeply I sympathize on you&#xD;
behalf, I confess I seem to have forgot&#xD;
ten my late antipathy, the aversion&#xD;
which my weaker or my darker natur&#xD;
entertained for you. I am ready t&#xD;
accompany you to a magistrate. I an&#xD;
ready to do all in my-power to assist&#xD;
you in discovering the offender. Bu&#xD;
whether the robber be a professed child&#xD;
stealer, or one of those vagrant wretche&#xD;
whom we call- gypsies, I think, in thf&#xD;
first place, a reward ought to be effere(&#xD;
for his apprehension."&#xD;
" And for the restoration of th(&#xD;
cehild!I" cried the mother.&#xD;
" Certainly," said Somerset, vacillat&#xD;
ing between two opinions, and shaker&#xD;
in his first belief more and more. Hi&#xD;
doubts were beginning even to affect&#xD;
his wife. She looked at Hartley, and&#xD;
shuddered less. Her indignation visibly&#xD;
subsided, and her manner, though ful&#xD;
of sorrow, gradually softened towards&#xD;
him,&#xD;
"Children of a very young age,'&#xD;
sId Hartley, addressing her, "cannot,&#xD;
I believe, be easily identified, or de-&#xD;
secibed. Are you aware, madam, that&#xD;
the lost infant had any peculiar mark&#xD;
whereby it might be distinguished from&#xD;
another ?"&#xD;
"Yes; a mole near the elbow."&#xD;
"That peculiarity, then, should be&#xD;
named in the description. Had we not&#xD;
better at once repair to a magis-&#xD;
trate ?".               - a&#xD;
Mr. Somerset hurriedly for a few&#xD;
moments conferred with his wife.&#xD;
Hartley, as he stood behind them un-&#xD;
seen, surveyed them from beneath his&#xD;
bent brows. There was a singularly&#xD;
malicious, as well as an exulting ex-&#xD;
pression in the look which stole side-&#xD;
ways from those half-shut eyes ; and a&#xD;
sneer of ,.intense bitterness lurked in&#xD;
the slight smile which, for'an, instant,&#xD;
raised his thin upper lip. The speakers,&#xD;
their conference over, turned,-and the&#xD;
face of Hartley was calm and anxiously&#xD;
sorrowful as before.,&#xD;
"aRolad,"asaid the duped and kind-&#xD;
hearted, brother, extending his hand,&#xD;
"can you forgive us ? The, anguish&#xD;
we felt in the first moment of our loss&#xD;
impaired our better judgment. We are&#xD;
now satisfied. We believe you to be&#xD;
an innocent man I"-&#xD;
Hartley did not consider it prudent,&#xD;
this time, to refuse returning the court-&#xD;
esy of him whom, nevertheless, he still&#xD;
&#xD;
o regarded with sentiments of unmiti-&#xD;
r gated hatred.&#xD;
-   "Isabella," pursued Somerset, "is&#xD;
n fatigued with her journey, and requires&#xD;
e rest ; I will take her to the hotel, and&#xD;
o return in half an hour, when we will&#xD;
consult further together, and proceed&#xD;
t to a magistrate."&#xD;
t   Hartley approved of what his brother&#xD;
- proposed, and Somerset and his wife&#xD;
s immediately quitted his chambers.&#xD;
e   It was with a feeling of indescribable&#xD;
d pleasure and with much self-congratu-&#xD;
lation that Hartley now, enabled to&#xD;
e breathe freely, threw himself into a&#xD;
chair. He had steered through the&#xD;
- Scylla of a terrible difficulty, and had&#xD;
not fallen into the whirlpool of Charyb-&#xD;
s dis. So far he was triumphant, and&#xD;
t all he desired had come to pass.&#xD;
, But his pleasing .meditations were&#xD;
disturbed- by a low knocking. in the.&#xD;
l adjoining room, and he suddenly be-&#xD;
thought himself of his coadjutor,-the&#xD;
imprisoned attorney.  Hartley forth-&#xD;
with proceeded to the closet, and set&#xD;
him at liberty.&#xD;
Mr. Pike, when he came forth,:was&#xD;
pale, haggard, and trembling. He had&#xD;
overheard portions of the late conver-&#xD;
sation, especially that part which re-&#xD;
ferred to transportation. beyond the&#xD;
seas. Though conscious-of Hartleys&#xD;
ability,,he had feared lest some chance&#xD;
word, or unguarded burst of passion,&#xD;
might have; betrayed their cause. , All,&#xD;
however, had terminated satisfactorily;&#xD;
and, receiving a full assurance of their&#xD;
mutual safety, the little man grinned&#xD;
a pleasant smile, nodded his head&#xD;
briskly two or three times, and rubbed&#xD;
together his lean hands.&#xD;
" Now go," said Hartley; "for he&#xD;
will very soon return. Stay a moment;&#xD;
had you not better take the child and&#xD;
the woman immediately into the coun-&#xD;
try?"&#xD;
"By no means. . The densely crowd-&#xD;
ed districtof Whiteehapel, where every&#xD;

offers a safer place of concealment ;than&#xD;

MEN SOMETIMES- LOVE WHEN THEY DO NOT&#xD;
KNOW IT.&#xD;
THE wiles of craft baffled the lynx&#xD;
eye of the law. Pike had taken his&#xD;
measures so well that the child of&#xD;
Hugh Somerset was never recovered.&#xD;
Whether it died, or whether it was&#xD;
subsequently received'into some me-&#xD;
tropolitan workhouse as a foundling&#xD;
dropped at their doors, did not appear.&#xD;
The mystery remained unsolved. Pike&#xD;
exulted in his cleverness, Hartley en-&#xD;
joyed his revenge, and the parents&#xD;
mourned ; but the world-the great,&#xD;
cold, selfish world, including the magis-&#xD;
trate, and the humbler police function-&#xD;
ary-soon forgot everything respecting&#xD;
the circumstance. That world had&#xD;
something else to occupy itself withal;&#xD;
and the dispensers of the law, busied&#xD;
with new cases of crime, gave quietly&#xD;
to oblivion that -which was past and&#xD;
could not be remedied.&#xD;
Yet Hartley had made a discovery&#xD;
which startled himself as well as stag-&#xD;
gered his philosophy. Up to the mo-&#xD;
ment that Isabella had last entered his&#xD;
chambers, he conceived the love he&#xD;
once entertained for her had given place&#xD;
to feelings of a precisely adverse na-&#xD;
ture -that he hated, abhorred'her.&#xD;
But his thoughts which, in defiance&#xD;
of all his efforts, still reverted to the&#xD;
image of her beauty--the never-ceasing&#xD;
manner in which the tones of her voice,&#xD;
low, tremulous; like mournf 1, music,&#xD;
haunted his spin  is rest  ness; the&#xD;
involuntary way in w ich her name&#xD;
would frequently spring to his lips-&#xD;
all convinced him that he had not, as,&#xD;
he believed, -subdued a passion now&#xD;
hopeless, and worse than insanity.&#xD;
Solitude is the nurse of love. The&#xD;
ethics of the schools, the frigid studies&#xD;
of science and philosophy, fail to quench&#xD;
&#xD;
its fire ; the lightnings of daring and&#xD;
evil aspirations will not blast the stub-&#xD;
born plant, nor will the commission of&#xD;
crime, though it hardens, root its&#xD;
tenacious fibres from the heart.&#xD;
Hartley was a lonely man; his studies&#xD;
were cold and gloomy ; his mind har-&#xD;
bored daring and skeptical opinions:&#xD;
and we have seen that he was no&#xD;
stranger to criminal actions. Thus&#xD;
situated, and his disposition moulded&#xD;
of such elements, he was a man to love&#xD;
and to hate, not as others who mix&#xD;
freely with the world, but with a depth,&#xD;
a strength, and an endurance, calcu-&#xD;
lated to urge him to any 'kind of mis-&#xD;
deed, and to steep his own soul in&#xD;
wretchedness for a lifetime.&#xD;
Whether Hartley paced up and down&#xD;
in his chambers, his sinister eyes half&#xD;
concealed by the drooping lids, and&#xD;
fixed on the floor; whether he walked&#xD;
the street abstracted, unobservig, un-&#xD;
delighted with all that allures and&#xD;
charms others; or whether he sat in&#xD;
the Temple gardens beneath the trees,&#xD;
the busy Thames -before him, and&#xD;
children, with their light feet and&#xD;
happy voices, gamboling around ; still&#xD;
his mind brooded on one subject-the&#xD;
envied position of his brother, blessed&#xD;
with the woman he himself had loved.&#xD;
And Hartley abandoned himself to&#xD;
the promptings of the soul. He strug-&#xD;
gled no longer. He clung to his pas-&#xD;
sion ; he: fed upon it, as the Oriental&#xD;
despot* is said to have banqueted upon&#xD;
poisons. He wooed the image during&#xD;
his waking dreams, and, in the wild&#xD;
visions of sleep, his fancy, unchecked,&#xD;
flew unto her side. He cursed her&#xD;
beauty, yet still dwelt upon its witchery&#xD;
with thoughts of fond delirium.&#xD;
Yet what was Hartley's love ? Oh 1I&#xD;
not the heaven-born unselfish flame&#xD;
which seeks only the welfare and de-&#xD;
light of the being adored. He wished&#xD;
Isabella, now that she could not be his,&#xD;
to experience no feeling but wretched-&#xD;
ness.  He would lacerate, her heart&#xD;
with every pang. He would drive kher&#xD;
to despair, to madness, all saving death,&#xD;
for death would defeat his purpose by&#xD;
at once suspending her suffering, and&#xD;
dissipating his dreams of solitary de-&#xD;
light.&#xD;
For how long a period would the&#xD;
revenge he- had already taken satisfy&#xD;
his soul? His life was monotonous,&#xD;

&#xD;
and consequently time, having few long ago in the centre of the panels on&#xD;

&#xD;
cheeks were healthy and florid ; the&#xD;
eyes clear and open'; and his smile had&#xD;
so much benevolence in it, was so full&#xD;
of honest, joyous feeling, that its fas-&#xD;
cination was irresistible.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset, as he held his book in&#xD;
his hand, at times glanced up from the&#xD;
page. It was not to survey the park&#xD;
without, the groups of old trees, or the&#xD;
church-tower beyond: his eyes fell&#xD;
with inexpressible pride and fondness&#xD;
on- a slight figure near him: -it was&#xD;
that of a girl about eleven years of age&#xD;
-his daughter Hester.&#xD;
She was sitting at the table bending&#xD;
over a sheet of drawing-paper. A&#xD;
bunch of flowers lay before her, and&#xD;
she was endeavoring to emulate their&#xD;
colors by the sweet mimicry of the&#xD;
painter's art. Her chair being rather&#xD;
elevated, she was compelled to stoop,&#xD;
so that the bright waves of her long&#xD;
auburn hair, falling forwards, half con-&#xD;
cealed her features, and many a round&#xD;
earl lay on the paper, like glittering&#xD;
gold rings on a surface of snow. How-&#xD;
ever beautiful in this position she&#xD;
looked, the girl did not appear to like-&#xD;
the intrusion of the hair thus shading&#xD;
her face, for, ever and- anon, with her&#xD;
little white hand, she impatiently flung&#xD;
back the mass of ringlets, and in that&#xD;
action her head was thrown backwards,&#xD;
and the exquisite contour of every fea-&#xD;
ture perfectly revealed.&#xD;
The face of a child of eleven years&#xD;
-ah I when the face of childhood is&#xD;
handsome, there is nothing so lovely, so&#xD;
fairy-like, so angelic in created nature.&#xD;
It seems as if the shadow of man's fall&#xD;
had not yet- reached those joyous sun-&#xD;
-bright features. The light of Eden is&#xD;
still undimmed in those innocent eyes,&#xD;
and the withering influences of care,&#xD;
of thought, and-sorrow-the curse pro-&#xD;
nounced upon man-have not come to&#xD;
steal one hue from those fresh peach-&#xD;
like cheeks. Holy cherubimare painted&#xD;
as children. Is it because these little&#xD;
ones, their span of life being so short,&#xD;
cannot have wandered far from their&#xD;
original source-Deity ?  Or is it be-&#xD;
cause their love, unmixed as yet with-&#xD;
earthly passion, is the type of all purity&#xD;
and holiness ?'&#xD;
Hester, the light-hearted, the beauti-&#xD;
ful fairy, free and gay as the butterfly&#xD;
of spring ; merry as the summer bee ;&#xD;
thou -pearl beneath the waters of life !&#xD;
thou rosebud with thy delicate leaves&#xD;
still folded up in their coy unblown&#xD;
&#xD;
EARLY TRAITS-" HE WOULD BE A&#xD;
SOLDIER."&#xD;
LEAVING, our heroine, Hester, and -&#xD;
her father in the oak drawing-room of&#xD;
.Brookland Hall, we must quietly pro-&#xD;
ceed to a spot about two miles distant.&#xD;
There, in a small field, a lad, who&#xD;
might be thirteen years of age, was&#xD;
&#xD;
sweetness I  Wouhrf it were in our&#xD;
power to paint thee as thou oughtest to&#xD;
be painted, fair young child.! but thy&#xD;
sweet features, scarcely developed, like&#xD;
some star behind its silvery cloud,&#xD;
must remain undescribed in their soft&#xD;
haze. Little Hebe, with the pouting&#xD;
cherry lip, with the full laugh of delight&#xD;
ringingfrom the soul ; or with the tear&#xD;
of infantine tenderness hanging on the&#xD;
long lashes of thy deep blue eyes ; the&#xD;
picture must be left to the imagination.&#xD;
We cannot fix the magic hues of the&#xD;
prismatic bow on earthly canvas ; we&#xD;
cannot, therefore, hope to delineate the&#xD;
ever-changing elements of such loveli-&#xD;
ness, bright child, as thine.&#xD;
The father hung over the chair of&#xD;
his daughter, and watched the progress'&#xD;
which she made in her painting. - The&#xD;
pride he felt'in possessing for his child&#xD;
a creature so purely beautiful as Hes-&#xD;
ter was excusable, and- Mr. Somerset&#xD;
spoke no word, but held his very breath&#xD;
for the delight which he experienced.&#xD;
Hester was so intent on her odcupa-&#xD;
tion that, for a few minutes, she was&#xD;
unconscious her father was near her..&#xD;
A shadow, as he intercepted the light.&#xD;
from the window, fell on the drawing-&#xD;
paper ; then she became aware that he&#xD;
stood behind her, and the young girl,&#xD;
flinging aside her curls with both hands,&#xD;
let her head fall back over the chair,&#xD;
looking up into his face with a peal of&#xD;
merry, silvery, musical laughter.&#xD;
Somerset stooped and kissed' her&#xD;
forehead. Happy moments overbrim-&#xD;
ming with pleasure I reckless age of&#xD;
the heart's gushing glee and trusting&#xD;
fondness. The earth, with all its dark-&#xD;
ness and misery, has still scenes and&#xD;
transitory hours which  shine  like&#xD;
glimpses of lost Paradise-those scenes&#xD;
are scenes of home felicity and hal-&#xD;
lowed love-those hours are the hours&#xD;
of joyous bounding childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
sitting on a bank. He was attired in&#xD;
a little blue smock-frock ; a black lea-&#xD;
ther -cap, its only adornment being a&#xD;
button in front, covered his head; his&#xD;
stockings were ofcoarse worsted, saved&#xD;
from the disfigurement of holes through&#xD;
the compassion of sundry darns ; while&#xD;
his heavy unpolished shoes were tied&#xD;
with thongs, and full of bob-nails.&#xD;
Nevertheless, the countenance of the&#xD;
boy was remarkable, and-looking on it,&#xD;
you entirely forgot the meanness of his&#xD;
habiliments. There was a boldness in&#xD;
the profile, and a pride, a resolution,&#xD;
expressed in every glance he gave, to-&#xD;
tally at variance with the usual cha-&#xD;
racteristics of the peasant's child. The&#xD;
forehead was high and large, the nose&#xD;
aquiline, the chin beautifully rounded ;&#xD;
the features altogether were singularly&#xD;
marked, as well as prematurely deve-&#xD;
loped; but the expression, which other-&#xD;
wise had been hard and stern, was&#xD;
relieved by the playful dimples of the&#xD;
cheek, and the arch, penetrating, mer-&#xD;
ry eye. His complexion was fair, but&#xD;
the short crisp curls which escaped&#xD;
from beneath his leathercap were black&#xD;
and glossy as jet.&#xD;
And what influence could the des-&#xD;
tiny of this poor lad, with the hob-&#xD;
nailed shoes, exert on the- fortunes of&#xD;
tlje wealthy owner of Brookland Hall?&#xD;
Men, short-sighted, too often ridicule&#xD;
the notion of the obscure and little&#xD;
rising over, and eclipsing, the already&#xD;
illustrious or great. But genius never&#xD;
stands still. Ambition breaks down&#xD;
the strong walls of conventionalism;&#xD;
and, w, long; as the world endures,&#xD;
some will be incessantly struggling up-&#xD;
wards, and climbing, by all .possible&#xD;
and never-dreamt-of steps, above the&#xD;
heads of their fellows.&#xD;
Lewis Banks was the son of a snall&#xD;
farmer, a poor but industrious man, a&#xD;
tenant of Mr. Somerset. He little re-&#xD;
sembled.other children of his age; the-&#xD;
rustics, who knew nothing of character,&#xD;
because the lad, had no relish for the,&#xD;
toil in which their lives were passed,&#xD;
considered him idle.  Some, seeing&#xD;
him  moody, .absent, and thoughtful,&#xD;
declared him to be mad; while all&#xD;
agreed he was the most Junpromising&#xD;
cub that ever tried the patience .of a&#xD;
father. His mind had-taken a peculiar&#xD;
turn from the time when he first heard&#xD;
in the village alehouse a London news-&#xD;
paper'read by a political blacksmith; de-&#xD;
tailing the particulars of a great battle&#xD;
&#xD;
-- -        .-..~--~-ago"--~-&#xD;
&#xD;
30&#xD;
&#xD;
fought on the continent ; from that day&#xD;
he thought of little else but marches,&#xD;
sieges, drums, banners, and all the&#xD;
paraphernalia of glorious war.&#xD;
It appears to be pretty generally&#xD;
agreed, that what we usually denomi-&#xD;
nate "genius," is innate, not acquired.&#xD;
One is said to be bora with a genius for&#xD;
oratory ; another for inditing verses;&#xD;
a third- for painting; and a fourth&#xD;
for the mechanical arts. So we'-must&#xD;
conclude that our little peasant-boy&#xD;
came into the world with a genius for&#xD;
fighting, or, in other words, was de-&#xD;
signed by nature to be a successful&#xD;
destroyer of his species.&#xD;
Lewis had been seat into his father's&#xD;
field to weed and "bank" potatoes.&#xD;
With lusty hand he plied his task for a&#xD;
short-time; .then, as the humor seized&#xD;
him, he turned aside, and commenced&#xD;
very busily raising a mound of earth.&#xD;
Childish and simple as the action was;&#xD;
his whole soul seemed absorbed in it.&#xD;
The mound was intended to represent a&#xD;
fortification, such as he had seen in&#xD;
pictures, and the old village veteran&#xD;
with the wooden leg had described to&#xD;
him. He raised ramparts of turf, and&#xD;
a central tower by means of, a few&#xD;
stones. He drew around it with his&#xD;
hoe the "deep encircling moat," across&#xD;
which a stick laid down served for a&#xD;
bridge. Then erecting his hoe in the&#xD;
centre, he attached to it his little red&#xD;
neckerchief, which the breeze blew out&#xD;
-and this was the enemy's standard.&#xD;
Lewis was now sitting on the bank,&#xD;
regarding with quiet complacency his&#xD;
finished performance. His elbow rest-&#xD;
ed on his knee, and his cheek was&#xD;
leant on his hand. His countenance&#xD;
was perfectly grave, and he seemed to&#xD;
be intently thinking, for his lips moved&#xD;
at intervals, and a smile, half expres-&#xD;
sive of melancholy and half of fierce&#xD;
pleasure, flitted across his intelligent&#xD;
and beautiful face. Suddenly the boy&#xD;
rose, as though he had formed a reso-&#xD;
lution on which pended .a matter of&#xD;
high, importance. ..He drew from his&#xD;
pocket a piece of wood about six inches&#xD;
long:; a hole had been drilled.in it, and&#xD;
-the work of many an hour-it had&#xD;
assumed under the plastic power of his&#xD;
stick-knife the form of a cannon. The&#xD;
same magazine, his pocket, furnished&#xD;
forth, the ammunition, a halfpenny-&#xD;
worth of powder, wrapped carefully in&#xD;
a morsel of brown paper.&#xD;
The process of loading commenced;&#xD;

&#xD;
the cannon-shot, a marble, was duly&#xD;
lodged in the throat of the "engine of&#xD;
death," At this moment, on the far-&#xD;
ther side of the hedge, a man might&#xD;
have been observed cautiously stealing&#xD;
along : his back was bent low ; an omi-&#xD;
nous frown was on his face, and a long&#xD;
carter's whip in his hand.&#xD;
Wholly occupied by his task, Lewis&#xD;
steadied his cannon between two stones,&#xD;
and, falling on his knees in the dirt,&#xD;
pointed it with the gravity of a veteran&#xD;
artilleryman at the color flying over&#xD;
his fortress. With a flint and bit of&#xD;
iron (the lucifer-match was then among&#xD;
the secrets and mysteries of earth), he&#xD;
struck a spark above the touch-hole.&#xD;
The wooden cannon exploded with a&#xD;
report which sounded sweeter than the&#xD;
burst of a hundred musical instru-&#xD;
ments, in the ears of the embryo sol-&#xD;
dier. The marble had struck the color-&#xD;
staff-it fell, and the fine eyes of Lewis&#xD;
glittered with phasure ; while giving&#xD;
vent to the ardor of his bosom, he ut-&#xD;
tered a faint applauding shout.&#xD;
"1Holloa! you rascal I" cried a gruff&#xD;
voice, and the man, before alluded to,&#xD;
sprang over the hedge, and the next&#xD;
moment, with his whip raised in the&#xD;
air, stood before the affrighted stripling.&#xD;
His great brawny hand trembled with&#xD;
passion, and his red cheeks were puf-&#xD;
fed out with rage.&#xD;
"I've found thee again, have I?" ex-&#xD;
claimed the farmer-; "thou young imp&#xD;
of idleness !-thou torment of thy fa-&#xD;
ther!-thou good-for-nothing disgrace&#xD;
to an honest family !--thou born to&#xD;
the gallows!  But I'll cure thee, I&#xD;
warrant-I'll whip the Evil One out&#xD;
of thee."         ,&#xD;
Lewis, while this paternal address&#xD;
was being delivered, had retreated a&#xD;
few paces, but still,.as he went slowly&#xD;
backwards, the incensed father fol-&#xD;
lowed. The lad uttered not a word in&#xD;
self-defence, but kept his dark express-&#xD;
ive eyes. fixed on that bloated- peony&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"And how much hast thou done of&#xD;
the work I set thee, sirrah ?" continued&#xD;
the peasant, shaking his_ whip in a&#xD;
more threatening manner.&#xD;
"1What, not one row of 'tatoes bank-&#xD;
ed, nor a dozen weeds pulled up ? and&#xD;
you've been here four mortal hours t-&#xD;
Now, you needn't try to run off, for I'm&#xD;
going to flog thee."&#xD;
"I don't mean to r'n off," said the&#xD;
boy, doggedly, his fear, it was evident,&#xD;
&#xD;
having considerably subsided. "Fa-&#xD;
ther," he added, firmly, "I advise you&#xD;
not to touch me with that whip."&#xD;
"And why not ?" said the farmer.&#xD;
" Zooks ! my lad, I suppose you think&#xD;
I'm afraid of thee-a man afraid of a&#xD;
child-that's a good joke, ha !" and the&#xD;
honest ploughman's huge sides shook&#xD;
with laughter.&#xD;
Banks, however, was incapable of&#xD;
comprehending his own sensations,&#xD;
and as Lewis's bright eye was still&#xD;
riveted on his bluff face, he did fear the&#xD;
child he affected to scorn. Mind, even&#xD;
ii such a frail tenement, exerted its&#xD;
never-failing influence on mere brute&#xD;
matter ; the whip gradually lowered,&#xD;
and was less tightly grasped, ye he&#xD;
bull-dog in the man was not su -&#xD;
dued.&#xD;
"And what's here ?" cried the far.&#xD;
mer, approaching the little fortification,&#xD;
and with his great shoes kicking down&#xD;
the turf battlements. " Odso ! this -is&#xD;
the way you spend your tint, is it?&#xD;
The boy's cracked, quite mad, that's&#xD;
certain.  Here's  your  gun, too."&#xD;
(Lewis, in his hurry, had left his can-&#xD;
non on the ground, but he now made&#xD;
a plunge to secure what he valued so&#xD;
highly.) "No, I'm too quick for thee,&#xD;
this time, young rascal!" said the&#xD;
farmer.-&#xD;
Lewis had, indeed, missed it, and the&#xD;
luckless lad beheld his treasure-the&#xD;
idol thing-on the ,*workmanship of&#xD;
which he hied expended so much labor,-&#xD;
in the grasp of his irritated parent.&#xD;
The farmer looked at it, shook his head&#xD;
in philosophic sorrow, and then delibe-&#xD;
rately broke it across his knee!&#xD;
Lewis, for the first time, was visibly&#xD;
affected. He stamped his little foot in-&#xD;
unavailing rage ; and presently, as the&#xD;
full amount of his loss seemed to im-&#xD;
press itself on his mind, his eyes filled&#xD;
with tears. Then the child spoke out&#xD;
boldly, resolutely, but -he made no&#xD;
allusion to his lost cannon.&#xD;
"Father, you can. do nothing with&#xD;
me. I tell, you again, I can't spend&#xD;
my time working in the fields. Ibe-&#xD;
lieve I was born for something better&#xD;
and higher. You may laugh at me, if&#xD;
you please; but I-cannot weed, I can-&#xD;
not -dig, I cannot drive the horses.&#xD;
There is something in me, I don't know&#xD;
what it is, that makes me discontented&#xD;
with those things, and weary of them;&#xD;
they lead to nothing; you go on from&#xD;
year to year, and leave off just where&#xD;
&#xD;
you began. You work, you eat, an&#xD;
then, father, you die."&#xD;
"I tell you, boy, you're demented&#xD;
stark mad!" cried the honest farmer&#xD;
staring bewildered on his son, with hi&#xD;
mouth open.&#xD;
"Perhaps I am   mad. Give me&#xD;
half year's schooling ; let me learn t&#xD;
read and write, and I will trouble yoi&#xD;
no more. You shall then have one les&#xD;
to provide for."&#xD;
" Schooling? learn to read? wha&#xD;
next? Are you better than your owi&#xD;
father, I should .like to know? andI&#xD;
can't read. Learning only makes th&#xD;
poor idle and rebellious. There's mor&#xD;
evil than good in it. Thank God! .&#xD;
can dig, plough, and cut down a fielc&#xD;
of hay without the help of any stupid&#xD;
stuff they .teach in schools. So, lool&#xD;
you, my man, I sha'n't do you tha&#xD;
great wrong by putting you to school,&#xD;
Besides, I can't afford it."&#xD;
The boy's countenance assumed an&#xD;
expression of deep dejection, and he&#xD;
muttered to himself: " Can't afford it-&#xD;
true, true, he can't afford it." Then&#xD;
he seized his hoe, and looking at the&#xD;
farmer, said, "Father, if you will let&#xD;
me, Ill work now."&#xD;
* "But for how long? When I turn&#xD;
my back, I suppose you'll be making&#xD;
another cannon. Ah! I can't trust&#xD;
thee, idle one! But there, PIl not flog&#xD;
thee this time, so work away, my lad ;&#xD;
bank the'tatoes, and root up the weeds.&#xD;
I hope, by .teaching and patience, to&#xD;
make thee a sensible, industrious youth,&#xD;
after all." &#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
A BOLD DETERMINATION--THE PRETTY&#xD;
PLEADER.&#xD;
THE mind of the very young has&#xD;
alwa1y"een considered a curious and&#xD;
an in resting study; but the problem&#xD;
has ever been satisfactorily solved&#xD;
why one person, at an early age, should&#xD;
conceive an insatiate, thirst for know-&#xD;
ledge, or the acquisition of a certain&#xD;
science, while another, placed in pre-&#xD;
cisely similar circumstances, appears&#xD;
to be dead to the higher impulses of&#xD;
mind, possessing neither curiosity nor&#xD;
ambition of anykind. The first awakes,-&#xD;
as it were, at a .slight touch, from the&#xD;
torpor of mere animal existence; the&#xD;
&#xD;
32&#xD;
&#xD;
d last slumbers on through life, in spite,&#xD;
too, of every spur that may be applied&#xD;
, to rouse him from his lethargy.&#xD;
The mind of our little peasant had&#xD;
s cast off this sleep so fatal to the myri-&#xD;
ads of his class, and had sprung into&#xD;
a a consciousness of its powers. He&#xD;
o felt a longing for something unobtained&#xD;
u -a burning curiosity to look behind&#xD;
s the veil which ignorance hangs before&#xD;
the eyes of the spirit. At the same&#xD;
t time, he had sufficient knowledge&#xD;
n already (a rather rare acquisition, be it&#xD;
I said) to be convinced that he knew&#xD;
e nothing. Still the boy prayed his&#xD;
e father to place him under the care of&#xD;
I the village pedagogue.   The same&#xD;
answer was returned on all occasions--&#xD;
I the farmer could not, or would not,&#xD;
"afford it."  The spirit of Lewis was&#xD;
t irritated, but not subdued, and in order&#xD;
to enjoy the *advantages which the&#xD;
schoolmaster's reputed learning held&#xD;
out, he had recourse to a plan, the&#xD;
boldness of which,- when it became&#xD;
known, astounded his father, and filled&#xD;
his rustic companions with amaze.&#xD;
One fine day, having put on a clean&#xD;
smock-frock, and brought, by dint of&#xD;
hard scrubbing, to something like a&#xD;
polish his bob-nailed shoes, the adven-&#xD;
tigrous youth set out for no less a&#xD;
locality than Brookland Hall. Yes,-he&#xD;
intended to, pay a visit, on his own&#xD;
account, to the 'squire of the parish.&#xD;
When he drew near the fine old&#xD;
building, with its arched, traceried&#xD;
windows, clock-tower, and stately por-&#xD;
tico, he thought that the man who&#xD;
possessed such a dwelling had no occa-&#xD;
sion to envy a king, and must, as a&#xD;
natural consequence, be happy. Long-&#xD;
ings, ambitions-mixed, however, with&#xD;
no dishonest feelings-stirred within&#xD;
him; fancy leaped in the gulf of years,&#xD;
and some wandering demon or fairy&#xD;
seemed to whisper in-his ear, "Brook-.&#xD;
land Hall shall-one day be thine!"&#xD;
Then his large eyes sparkled, and his&#xD;
little heart palpitated beneath his&#xD;
coarse check shirt.&#xD;
Nothing  abashed, Lewis walked&#xD;
around one of. the wings of the build-&#xD;
ing, and entered the gravelled space&#xD;
in frqnt.- He well knew that if he&#xD;
applied to the servants. at the back of&#xD;
the mansion they would drive -him&#xD;
away, and this would have annihilated&#xD;
his hopes, as regarded his contem-&#xD;
plated interview with Mr. Somerset.&#xD;

but I don't wish to remain so. The&#xD;
parson has not set up any Sunday-&#xD;
school, and father says he's too poor to&#xD;

What I would ask is-" the boy drew&#xD;
a long breath, and continued, "I'll&#xD;
.speak it out at once. Will your honor&#xD;
treat me with a half year's schooling?"&#xD;
" Upon my word, Master Lewis, you&#xD;
are a bold beggar," said Mr. Somerset,&#xD;
endeavoring to look grave.&#xD;
There was a minute's pause, during'&#xD;
which brief interval a slight rustle&#xD;
was heard in the far corner of the&#xD;
library, where stood a high painted&#xD;
screen. A table'appeared to be pushed&#xD;
away, and a book dropped on the floor:&#xD;
then a fair young face was seen timid-&#xD;
ly peering forth, a mass of golden ring-&#xD;
lets half hiding her cheeks and white&#xD;
-arching neck. Presently the whole&#xD;
figure emerged; the girl, we scarcely&#xD;
need add, was Mr. Somerset's daugh-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
Light as a fairy, -walking over&#xD;
flowers, little IIester bounded up to&#xD;
her father's chair.&#xD;
Strange was the effect produced on&#xD;
Lewis by that beautiful apparition.&#xD;
His eyes were fixed on her, but fixed&#xD;
in astonishment and admiration, rather&#xD;
than in rudeness or familiarity.&#xD;
" Father," said Hester in her soft&#xD;
silvery voice, " do not refuse him. Let&#xD;
him go to the village school."&#xD;
"Heyday, pretty pleader, and why?&#xD;
What is the lad to you ?"&#xD;
" Nothing," said Hester, hanging&#xD;
her head, her little cherry lip pouting,&#xD;
"but he's the boy who the people say&#xD;
is a 'genius.' "&#xD;
" A genius ! ha, ha !" laughed Mr.&#xD;
Somerset good-humoredly.-&#xD;
"-He's always building castles, and&#xD;
making cannons and firing them ; no&#xD;
doubt he wishes to be able to read about&#xD;
battles and sea-fights,,so don't refuse'&#xD;
him what he asks ; pay for his school-&#xD;
ing at Mr. Sharp's."&#xD;
Hester, as she finished her petition,&#xD;
ventured to glance at Lewis ; her look-&#xD;
was timid and given sidelong ; and as&#xD;
.she encountered his great brilliant&#xD;
eyes, with the beautiful instinct of her&#xD;
sex felt and obeyed even at that early&#xD;
age, she hastily turned away her head,I&#xD;
her young cheek flushing, and the lily1&#xD;
even of her forehead converted to a&#xD;
rose. The next moment she glided&#xD;
softly across the room, and again dis-&#xD;
appeared behind the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
84&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
35&#xD;
&#xD;
V'&#xD;
&#xD;
Lewis spoke no more, but looked on&#xD;
the carpet, at the cap in his hand, then&#xD;
at the screen: $nally he cast an in-&#xD;
quiring glance at the 'squire.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset was not acute or sus-&#xD;
picious enough to observe anything&#xD;
extraordinary in the manner of the&#xD;
children ; nor was he sufficiently phi-&#xD;
losophical to speculate on character, 'or&#xD;
consider how secret and subtile is the&#xD;
magnetic chain which extends from&#xD;
heart to heart,; how early in life its&#xD;
links can be forged; and how small&#xD;
are the incidents which sometimes&#xD;
point man's destiny, and color the&#xD;
events of after years.&#xD;
"My lad," said Mr. Somerset, as he&#xD;
drew a sheet of paper towards him and&#xD;
began to scribble upon it, "you are a&#xD;
smart fellow, and your father, though&#xD;
poor, is industrious and honest ; per-&#xD;
haps I shall lower his rent next half&#xD;
year."  The letter was finished and&#xD;
folded.. "Here, take this," he added,&#xD;
" to the village schoolmaster, and he&#xD;
will give you a twelvemonth's tuition&#xD;
on my account."&#xD;
Lewis received the note, and stan;-&#xD;
mered forth his thanks, his hand trem-&#xD;
bling with delight, and his eyes filled&#xD;
with tears of gratitude.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
FIRST LOVE.&#xD;
IT was only six o'clock in the morn-&#xD;
ing, yet the July sun, sworn against&#xD;
sluggard habits, had been up for some&#xD;
two hours. No human being, how-&#xD;
ever, was yet seen in the wide-extended&#xD;
park, saving one; a stripling was lean-&#xD;
ing against a tree, just within the iron&#xD;
palings on the northern boundary.&#xD;
Behind him swept; the deep ditch in&#xD;
which Pike had concealed himself when&#xD;
he committed the, outrage on the in-&#xD;
fant child of Mr. Somerset.   Lewis&#xD;
Banks, for he it was, had heard of the&#xD;
tale, but he thought nothing of it now.&#xD;
The peasant-boy was smitten by love&#xD;
of reading, a few months with the&#xD;
village schoolmaster having enabled&#xD;
him to acquire that accomplishment;&#xD;
but his eyes were not fited on his book&#xD;
now. The "Wars of -Marlborough,"&#xD;

hand of misfortune or change ? Such flhe intruder looked around, trembling&#xD;
&#xD;
lest any eye   should observe him.&#xD;
The splash of the fountain sounding&#xD;
in his ear, he was guided by its mur-&#xD;
murs, and darting behind a trellis-work&#xD;
thickly covered with flowering shrubs,&#xD;
reached the entrance of the grotto. A&#xD;
moment more, and Lewis was safe&#xD;
within the sparry labyrinth. In addi-&#xD;
tion to the reflection of the sunbeams&#xD;
at the entrance, light was admitted&#xD;
through a large crystal in the roof.&#xD;
In this place Hester spent much of her&#xD;
time, and everything arounfti announc-&#xD;
ed her industry and her taste. Lewis&#xD;
seated himself behind a pedestal,&#xD;
which was surmounted by the statue&#xD;
of a nymph, and resolved to wait there&#xD;
until the girl might pay her accustomed&#xD;
visit.&#xD;
Meantime, his heart was a prey to&#xD;
misgivings, as well as secret apprehen-&#xD;
sions of detection.- Then the antici-&#xD;
pated meeting with Hester filled his&#xD;
bosom with painful, yet ecstatic flutter-&#xD;
.ings.  Thus thinking, listening, and&#xD;
half trembling, did he pass the time ;&#xD;
but now heavy steps were heard on the&#xD;
gravelled walk without, and a man, with&#xD;
a hoarse voice, seemed to be keeping&#xD;
up a running dialogue with himself.&#xD;
"Who's been trampling on my beds?&#xD;
That's not Miss Hester's foot,I'llswear.&#xD;
Ha ! it's that young groom; if he comes&#xD;
into my garden again, I'll chop off his&#xD;
toes with the spade. But where's the&#xD;
spade? where is she ? I think I put her&#xD;
into the grotto last night."&#xD;
Lewis started up in alarm. Should&#xD;
he at once rush out and effect his es-&#xD;
cape, or should he stand and boldly de-&#xD;
fend himself? He was in a stooping&#xD;
attitude, apparently in the  act of&#xD;
springing, yet he did not move ; the&#xD;
heavy steps were approaching, and&#xD;
still the gardener talked of his spade&#xD;
within the grotto, when a silvery voice&#xD;
was heard, not far distant, calling him&#xD;
by name. The man instantly trudged&#xD;
away, and Lewis, relieved from his&#xD;
fears, was again able to breathe.&#xD;
She was, then, in the garden, among&#xD;
the flowers-the sweetest, the freshest&#xD;
flower of them all-the little adored&#xD;
one--the light-footed fairy. Lewis felt&#xD;
a dizziness come upon him, and he held&#xD;
by the pedestal for support. His heart&#xD;
beat so wildly that his breast seemed&#xD;
too small to contain it. The gardener&#xD;
did not return; probably he had found&#xD;
his spade: but instead of him-was it&#xD;
the light caroling of a bird hovering&#xD;
&#xD;
enamored over the flowers, and winging&#xD;
nearer and still nearer to the grotto?&#xD;
Yet those notes, joyously musicals and&#xD;
aerial as they might be, were also&#xD;
human. It was the happy song from&#xD;
the sweet throat of gay-hearted child-&#xD;
hood-the spontaneous gushing forth&#xD;
in melody of bright and pure thoughts.&#xD;
Hester stopped before. the fountain&#xD;
at the entrance, and the boy from his&#xD;
hiding-place could distinctly see her.&#xD;
She began to throw crumbs of bread&#xD;
into the water, for the silver-fish to&#xD;
nibble at. The attitude, as she bent&#xD;
forward, was well calculated to display&#xD;
the grace of her sylphlike figure. Her&#xD;
dress, too, became her well, although&#xD;
somewhat fantastic. A little straw hat&#xD;
was perched upon her sunny curls ; a&#xD;
scarf of blue silk was passed carelessly&#xD;
over her neck, being tied in a knot be-&#xD;
hind; beneath this her snowy muslin&#xD;
frock spread to unusual dimensions,&#xD;
but, at the same time, it was very short,&#xD;
so that her beautiful little legs, cased&#xD;
in open-work thread stockings, were&#xD;
seen almost to the knee. Blue morocco&#xD;
slippers completed, so to speak, her&#xD;
picturesque attire.&#xD;
The eyes of the peasant boy were&#xD;
riveted on the fair form at the fountain.&#xD;
His fears and apprehensions had de-&#xD;
parted ; admiration and eagerness only&#xD;
possessed his heart. -He longed fqr&#xD;
her to approach. Every second he was&#xD;
about to quit his retreat, but some-&#xD;
thing held him back. Would she again&#xD;
fly, and deprive him of the opportunity&#xD;
of,speaking?&#xD;
Again Hester poured forth her notes&#xD;
-clear, melodious, glad: and, as the&#xD;
breeze wafted them inwards, - they&#xD;
seemed to fill the grotto. A little bird,&#xD;
also, in a wire cage, behind where&#xD;
Lewis stood, now warbled an answer&#xD;
in its low, soft trill. Then Hester, in&#xD;
childish sport, knelt on the brim  of&#xD;
the fountain, and, baring her snowy,&#xD;
rounded arm to; the shoulder, plunged&#xD;
it into the water, vainly endeavoring&#xD;
to catch ongof her favorite fish. She&#xD;
sprang up, shook the water-beads from&#xD;
her satiny skin, and. laughed a peal of&#xD;
ringing laughter. But now   moving&#xD;
back her straggling ringlets, she ap-&#xD;
peared to recollect some unperformed.&#xD;
task, and exclaimed,&#xD;
Ha I I hear him. Must bring the&#xD;
bird out into the sun; he wants his&#xD;
breakfast."&#xD;

the bird in the cage near Lewis; and&#xD;
Hester had no sooner uttered them&#xD;
than she glided into the grotto.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
LOVES'S FIRST LESSON.&#xD;
THERE was a start, a slight shriek ;&#xD;
for the first feelings of Hester, as she&#xD;
perceived the intruder, were alarm and&#xD;
astonishment. Her gleesome course&#xD;
suddenly checked, she moved back-&#xD;
wards on tiptoe, yet kept her eyes fixed&#xD;
on Lewis in fearful curiosity. The lat-&#xD;
ter now sprang towards her."&#xD;
" Stay one instant. Fear nothing.&#xD;
Do you not remember me ?"&#xD;
His bright eyes, his maanly little&#xD;
figure, his black, curly head, and, more&#xD;
than all, the penetrating and strikingly&#xD;
intellectual. expression of his face,&#xD;
could not be forgotten by Hester; and,&#xD;
looking on him, she felt reassured, and&#xD;
her alarm subsided.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I remember you. But&#xD;
what do you want ? Why are you&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
"I have long wished to thank you&#xD;
for your kindness, when you prevailed&#xD;
on Mr. Somerset to place me in the&#xD;
school, but I have had no opportunity.&#xD;
I am driven to this. Forgive me, then,&#xD;
and let me thank you now."&#xD;
Hester was. at a loss to account for&#xD;
there eagerness and the agitation of&#xD;
Lewis ; yet nature's book is early&#xD;
opened, -and some of its- plainer pas-&#xD;
sages are easily read. True, she under-&#xD;
stood not' his feelings, nor. her own;&#xD;
and yet a glimmering of the sense at-&#xD;
tached to the word "love" broke on&#xD;
her young mind   -&#xD;
" must go. You have now thanked&#xD;
me ; that is enough."&#xD;
" Not yet !" exclaimed Lewis, who,&#xD;
with his grave precocious intellect, saw&#xD;
deeper, into things than the other.&#xD;
"You' must first decide my fate."&#xD;
" I do not know what you mean,"&#xD;
said Hester, opening her sunny eyes.&#xD;
" And even if you did, perhaps you&#xD;
would only laugh at -me, and spurn&#xD;
from you the ploughman's son. Your&#xD;
family is high," he continued, de-&#xD;
jectedly ; " mine is low.  You are&#xD;
wealthy, and I am poor. Forone like&#xD;
yourself to talk to me at all is a stoop.&#xD;
ing-a kind of condescension.s Yes,"&#xD;
&#xD;
added Lewis, looking steadfastly at&#xD;
her, "no doubt you despise me."&#xD;
Despise such a countenance-such&#xD;
cleverness. It was impossible. Child-&#xD;
hood but slowly learns the science of&#xD;
veiling the sentiments, and the lip&#xD;
promptly utters what the heart sug-&#xD;
gests.&#xD;
" No, no I" cried Hester, eagerly ; " I&#xD;
admire you-not despise."&#xD;
These words called up light in the&#xD;
countenance of Lewis, and he felt en-&#xD;
couraged-eperhaps emboldened. ' But&#xD;
were we to pursue the scene further,&#xD;
we might incur the charge of tedious-&#xD;
ness. A dialogue between two chil-&#xD;
dren must needs be made up of&#xD;
littlenesses ; and their petty remarks,&#xD;
however' interesting to themselves, the&#xD;
chronicler cannot presume would be&#xD;
such to the general reader. Before&#xD;
Hester returned -to the house, Lewis&#xD;
had convinced her that their minds&#xD;
were near akin, though their lots in&#xD;
life might be wide apart. He spoke,&#xD;
of advancing himself in the world,,and&#xD;
of one day probably occupying a posi-&#xD;
tion- very different from that in which&#xD;
heinow stood. She shook her head at&#xD;
the bright dreams of his' fancy, but a&#xD;
strange feeling already possessed her&#xD;
in favor of the peasant boy..- The only&#xD;
thing which caused her pain and- un-&#xD;
easiness was that their present meet-&#xD;
ing, as well as any other which might&#xD;
follow, Lewis wished to be kept a pro-&#xD;
found secret from Mr. Somerset.&#xD;
"Good-by !" said Hester, as she&#xD;
went fluttering'out of their " trysting-&#xD;
place." " I will call off the gardener,&#xD;
and do you return by the same way as&#xD;
you entered."&#xD;
Has nature been overstepped and&#xD;
probability outraged in the incidents&#xD;
narrated? ' Ponder on the early deve-&#xD;
lopment of intellect in some children,&#xD;
and we think,,reader, thou wilt answer,&#xD;
No. Yet the conduct of these children&#xD;
may stand in need of some excuse or&#xD;
defence. As.for -the peasant's son, his&#xD;
character is suaiciently apparent, the&#xD;
chief elements-of which were boldness,&#xD;
a thirst of knowledge, and a most rest-&#xD;
less ambition. Our plea for Hester--&#xD;
the unthinking; guileless child of the&#xD;
flowers andsunny fields-must be her&#xD;
utter simplicity, and her entire igno-&#xD;
rance of the world. Do not condemn,&#xD;
do not even judge, until. more of her&#xD;
history be unfolded; for'the sunshine&#xD;
must be succeeded by the cloud, the&#xD;
&#xD;
sweet draught of rural felicity must be&#xD;
exchanged for the bitter cup of trial, in&#xD;
the wide and unsympathizing world.&#xD;
Again and again, before the sun had&#xD;
despoiled the grass and the trees of&#xD;
their diamonds, did Lewis find his way&#xD;
into the garden. Stronger and stronger&#xD;
became the links which bound the heart&#xD;
of the fair girl to the bold and beau-&#xD;
tiful scion of poverty. Deeper and&#xD;
deeper grew her feelings, until her&#xD;
young, wreathing smiles were changed&#xD;
into tremors and blushes, and often,&#xD;
when alone, into tears, But stolen&#xD;
bliss, "the sweeter for the theft," is&#xD;
commonly short-lived. The paradise&#xD;
of our little lovers was not fated to con-&#xD;
tinue long, and their precocious passion&#xD;
was compelled to resolve itself into a&#xD;
memory.&#xD;
"What do all this mean ?" said the&#xD;
sturdy gardener one day to himself,&#xD;
look ing suspiciously on the gravelled&#xD;
walks. " I find strange steps every&#xD;
morning which wer'n't here over night.&#xD;
There's something wrong, that's cer-&#xD;
tain. I'll watch."&#xD;
And watch the man did, concealing&#xD;
himself behind certain trees in the&#xD;
neighborhood, when Hester and Lewis&#xD;
believed him  out of they way. The&#xD;
{      consequence was, that. the gardener&#xD;
made, a full discovery of the identity of&#xD;
the bold intruder,.as well as the pur-&#xD;
2      pose for which he visited the place.'&#xD;
One morning, just after Hester had&#xD;
taken her tremulous "adieu," and left&#xD;
Lewisto effect his way out in- the usual&#xD;
lianner,,the, gaunt, hard-faced Scotch-&#xD;
.man (for the gardener was a native of&#xD;
the land of cakes) might have been&#xD;
seen creeping cautiously around from&#xD;
the back of the grotto. A malicious&#xD;
smile distorted hisfeatures, and he not&#xD;
only felt a pleasure in the anticipated&#xD;
punishment of the audacious ":genius,"&#xD;
or, in his opinion, the plague. of the&#xD;
village, but expectedfor the discovery&#xD;
he: had made to receive high praise&#xD;
from his master, 1r. Somerset.,&#xD;
Lewis was walking quietly forth, his&#xD;
.head full of dreams and his heart of&#xD;
sweet emotions,.when he suddenly felt&#xD;
as iron grasp upon his shoulder.&#xD;
.,        "Holloal I've caught thee at last,&#xD;
have I? thouyoung vagrant!l thou imp&#xD;
of the Evil One 1"-&#xD;
Lewis beheld his.enemy, and: com-&#xD;
prehended instantly the disastrous con-&#xD;
sequences that would attend his cap-.&#xD;
&#xD;
ture. His first actwas aviolent struggle&#xD;
to disengage himself. He thrust his&#xD;
head into the gardener's chest, and&#xD;
twined himself around his body.&#xD;
" Be still, rascalI" growled the man,&#xD;
" or I shall shake the life out of thee."&#xD;
The gardener for an instant lost his&#xD;
balance, and staggered backwards ; but&#xD;
he held in his gripe the boy's jacket,&#xD;
while his left hand was around Lewis's&#xD;
throat. Still the lad tugged at the&#xD;
huge legs, winding about them like a&#xD;
small constrictor. The man, reeled&#xD;
again, caught hold of a tree to save&#xD;
himself from falling -- the slender&#xD;
branch broke off in his hand, and he&#xD;
fell heavily on the ground. Could&#xD;
Lewis have freed himself now, his swift&#xD;
foot might have saved him. No; the&#xD;
iron hand was still around his neck.&#xD;
He could not move. He-was choking.&#xD;
The Scotchman swore, raised himself&#xD;
on his elbow, sprang again upon his&#xD;
feet, and holding Lewis at arm's length,&#xD;
was now certain of his prey.&#xD;
" Come along, you young viper i you&#xD;
hang-dog! you gallows-bird! we'll cure&#xD;
thee of these cunning tricks. We'll&#xD;
see what the 'squire will say to thee,&#xD;
so we will. This comes of thy learning,&#xD;
and thy playing with gunpowder, do&#xD;
it ? trespassing on gentlemen's private&#xD;
grounds, and, worse than=all, a-trying&#xD;
to deceive a poor innocent child, and&#xD;
to bring disgrace upon a noble family.&#xD;
A public whipping and the stocks&#xD;
would be too good. for thee. Thou'tIt&#xD;
at least be put into prison for a year,&#xD;
and worked at the treadmill."&#xD;
.All the while that the brawny tar-&#xD;
dener was. delivering this very pleasant.&#xD;
and consoling speech, hecontinued to&#xD;
drag Lewis. onward. Resistance was&#xD;
vain. - The muscles- of fourteen had&#xD;
little chance in fair contest with the&#xD;
muscles of forty. The boy yielded&#xD;
passively, but with, feelings of stifled&#xD;
indignation and burning-shame. The&#xD;
Scotchman,:with his prisoner, reached&#xD;
the flight of steps leading to-the terrace.&#xD;
One last, one desperate effort more on&#xD;
the part of Lewis--it proved.unavailing:&#xD;
Ie was hurried forwards, and now they&#xD;
were within a}few yards of the portico&#xD;
of the mansion.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset had just-risen, and was&#xD;
in his-library. - His quick eye espied&#xD;
the scene, and he immediately came&#xD;
out of the house. His perplexity and&#xD;
surprise were great as-.he beheld the&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
trembled and foamed with rage, and&#xD;
recognized in the little prisoner, whose&#xD;
round blue jacket was torn into shreds,&#xD;
the lad he had placed at school, the&#xD;
promising, son of his honest tenant,&#xD;
Caleb Banks. The gardener com-&#xD;
menced stammering something not at&#xD;
all calculated to enlighten Mr. Somer-&#xD;
set's mind;.at the same time, 'he shook&#xD;
the lad, his huge hand being still&#xD;
placed between the fragment of jacket&#xD;
and shirt, and the boy's neck.&#xD;
"Man, you need not hold me in this&#xD;
manner," said Lewis, feeling acutely&#xD;
the : disgrace of his situation ; "the&#xD;
'squire is here. I have no thought of&#xD;
escaping now.".&#xD;
His head was erect; his eyes flashed,&#xD;
in spite of two large tears of shame&#xD;
and anger which trembled on their&#xD;
lashes. 'The expression of his face,&#xD;
and his whole manner, were not those&#xD;
of a culprit, but rather of a hero.&#xD;
"What has the boy been doing,&#xD;
Allen ?" asked Mr.- Somerset, quietly.&#xD;
"Doing, your -honor? he is the&#xD;
vilest, wickedest reprobate in the whole&#xD;
country-he is."&#xD;
"Iam sorry to hear it. But what&#xD;
proof have you of this ?"&#xD;
"Every proof, your honor.    For&#xD;
one whole mortal month, every morn-&#xD;
ing, he's been entering my-your&#xD;
garden. I suspected the thing long&#xD;
ago, but only found it out for certain&#xD;
yesterday. So I've taken good care to&#xD;
seize him to-day, and bring him before&#xD;
your honor."&#xD;
"But what has been his motive,&#xD;
Allen? What has the lad been doing&#xD;
in the garden ?-stealing flowers ?"&#xD;
The curl of scorn on the lip of Lewis&#xD;
was a fine contrast to the .wide grin on&#xD;
the bluff features of the gardener. The&#xD;
latter, however, was confused. Though&#xD;
coarse enough, he had still some sense&#xD;
of regard for his master's family pride,&#xD;
and for a father's feelings.&#xD;
"Excuse- me, your honor, but I&#xD;
don't know exactly how to go on.&#xD;
He's an awful daring character is this&#xD;
boy, and I think, maybe, was born on&#xD;
purpose to swing on the gallows. The&#xD;
truth is, your honor, through some vile&#xD;
and wicked means, he's been a-trying&#xD;
to gain-I don't say more than a-trying&#xD;
-but, you see, Miss Hester&#xD;
Mr. Somerset slightly started, and&#xD;
his brow  grew dark.  He perfectly&#xD;
understood now the gardener's hints.&#xD;
At this inoment Rester ran out upon&#xD;
&#xD;
the terrace. Sie&amp;amp; had just caught a&#xD;
glimpse of Lewis from one of the upper&#xD;
windows, and, seeing him in the clutch-&#xD;
es of the dreaded gardener, was at&#xD;
no loss to divine the truth. Another&#xD;
person, too, entered upon the scene ; it&#xD;
was the tall footman, who, suspecting&#xD;
his presence might be needed, came&#xD;
forward with a stick in his hand. Mr.&#xD;
Somerset, anxious to avoid an exposure&#xD;
before his domestics, was about to order&#xD;
the gardener to lead his prisoner into&#xD;
the house ; but the precaution was too&#xD;
late. Hester, with a cry of terror, ran&#xD;
up to her father, and clung to his arm.&#xD;
" Do not punish him! do not injure&#xD;
him ! It is not his fault, but all my&#xD;
own.   He respects and loves you,&#xD;
father, and is grateful to you. , He&#xD;
will obey you in everything. Only&#xD;
give him his liberty; let him go."&#xD;
- These words were mtetered in such a&#xD;
piteous .accent, and followed by such&#xD;
sobs and such torrents of tears, that&#xD;
the indulgent father found 'hi angry&#xD;
feelings, soften, and was disposed to&#xD;
view the question in the mildest light.&#xD;
The fondness contracted by the two&#xD;
children thrown accidentally together&#xD;
was in no way surprising. True, the&#xD;
intimacy-though a subject now to be&#xD;
treated, he'thought, lightly-might, if&#xD;
continued, lead to very serious results.&#xD;
It was, therefore, incumbent on him at&#xD;
once to terminate it.&#xD;
" Boy," said Mr. Somerset, gravely,&#xD;
but with mildness, "your conduct in&#xD;
entering my grounds so frequently and&#xD;
in so secret a manner is highly to be&#xD;
blamed, but not unpardonable. Allen,&#xD;
you have done your, duty in making&#xD;
him your prisoner and bringing him to&#xD;
me, but now you will set him at liber-&#xD;
ty.".,&#xD;
The Scotchman looked black, being&#xD;
bitterly disappointed 'in-regard to the&#xD;
expected:punishment of the stocks; .&#xD;
whipping, or imprisonment which he&#xD;
had prophesied would be Lewis's fate.&#xD;
Like,a bull-dog drawn away from his&#xD;
antagonist,: he reluctantly loosed his&#xD;
hold.&#xD;
"But, surely, your honor," said the&#xD;
worthy gardener,-"you will let us give&#xD;
the young villain some punishment for&#xD;
insulting your honor."'&#xD;
" Has he, then, insulted master ?"&#xD;
said the tall footman, for he had heard&#xD;
nothing of the story. "Why, tfien,&#xD;
this is worse-than he behaved when he&#xD;
raidg;'some time ago, at our front door'.&#xD;

very jet-on, on, through the long&#xD;
heavy hours, like a remorseful memory&#xD;
which strives to 'sleep, but cannot'.,&#xD;
Little change might have been per-&#xD;
ceived in the countenance of Hartley,&#xD;
His physiognomy was one on which&#xD;
years produce small visible effects: the&#xD;
forehead, though it betrayed no wrinkle,&#xD;
was more massy, and the cheeks had&#xD;
parted with some of their freshness,&#xD;
but the jetty black of his hair conti-&#xD;
nued unaltered ; his teeth had lostnone&#xD;
of their dazzling whiteness ; the firm-&#xD;
ly-compressed mouth had its old ex-&#xD;
pression of austere, serenity and un-&#xD;
bending resolution; while his eyes,&#xD;
usually half closed; and always averted&#xD;
from the person whom he addressed,&#xD;
retained, when lit up by.anger, all their&#xD;
sinister fierceness and, withering fire.&#xD;
We have represented Hartley of that&#xD;
peculiar disposition which led him to&#xD;
brood over one subject for a great&#xD;
length of time.* Hence his love and&#xD;
his hatred were passions, not of anmonth,&#xD;
or a year, but of*a life's .duration.&#xD;
The image of her he loved, long, ago&#xD;
was as vivid to his fancy as it was era,&#xD;
she had accepted his rival.' His hatred&#xD;
for that rival had resigned not one&#xD;
particle of its bitterness, and his de-&#xD;
termination, of- regarding .him as a&#xD;
victim whom, however the final stroke&#xD;
might be delayed, he was resolved to&#xD;
crush, remained unshaken. 'Having&#xD;
contented himself with dreaming for&#xD;
years over "the, vengeance which he&#xD;
bad already obtained," he now awoke;&#xD;
from a'state that had, begun to resem-&#xD;
ble, so to speak, a reasoning sleep,.&#xD;
During the; time which had elapsedhe&#xD;
found that Soaeraet and his wife had&#xD;
conquered old sorrows, banished early-&#xD;
remembrances, and werenow perfectly-&#xD;
happy. Strange to, say, he rejoiced at&#xD;
this last circumstance, for had he not,&#xD;
in a measure, suspended- his perseen-.&#xD;
tions, and allowedthem to bask for&#xD;
awhile in the sin of peace and good,&#xD;
fortune, the, storm with which .he in-&#xD;
tended to overwhelm, them would be&#xD;
less severely felt. All conditions,-of&#xD;
pain as well as, of pleasure are height-&#xD;
ened by. contrast ; Hartley, therefore,&#xD;
was not hasty or headlong, but refined&#xD;
and methodical in the execution of his&#xD;
designs.&#xD;
Somerset and Isabella, then, were&#xD;
d happy ; lHartley was miserable, and&#xD;
they had occasioned, he believed,.his&#xD;
wretchedness. He; must drag them&#xD;
&#xD;
down to the same condition of moral&#xD;
suffering as that which he conceived&#xD;
his own to be, and until they were in&#xD;
the abyss-an. abyss from which they&#xD;
could not hope again to rise-his ven-&#xD;
geance -would not be satisfied or com-&#xD;

H.EST'ER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nebuchadnezzar's capital, yet, were we&#xD;
much pleased to witness this struggle&#xD;
after rural beauty in such a. spot. A&#xD;
flower in a nosegay, even to a cockney,&#xD;
is nothing compared with a flower&#xD;
really growing. The red earthen-pots&#xD;
were ranged in rows ; they boasted&#xD;
dwarf lupins, emaciated geraniums,&#xD;
and sickly mignonette, which sent&#xD;
forth all the odor their consumptive&#xD;
natures possibly could. The place is&#xD;
comparatively retired and quiet ; a few&#xD;
noisy children at times play on the&#xD;
broad flat stones with which the court&#xD;
is paved, or .disport themselves in the,&#xD;
gutter which,-like the Rhine separating&#xD;
two countries, pours gently its mud&#xD;
along, and divides " Brown's Build-&#xD;
ings" into two equal parts.&#xD;
Mr. Pike was not a householder ; he&#xD;
escaped all onerous responsibilities by&#xD;
hiring, at a cheap rate, a second floor.&#xD;
The stranger who entered his office&#xD;
found that, unlike many lawyers, he&#xD;
actually was a man of business. Bun-&#xD;
dles, tied with red tape, thumbed and,&#xD;
blackened by frequent reference-&#xD;
heaps of paper recently written on,&#xD;
lying about in great confusion-suffi-&#xD;
ciently intimated that Mr. Pike did&#xD;
not always dream or sit idle in that&#xD;
room. Yet the apartment was mi-&#xD;
serably furnished ; the chairs were&#xD;
cane-bottomed, withholes worn through&#xD;
the centre'; the table was worm-eaten,&#xD;
and cracked across the top, while the&#xD;
coarse Kidderminster carpet did not&#xD;
exceed two yards square.&#xD;
The door; standing ajar, revealed an&#xD;
apartment beyond. 'There the   eye&#xD;
was refreshed by the sight of sundry&#xD;
cooking utensils: a display of half-&#xD;
broken caps and saucers on a little&#xD;
sideboard; an old iron coal-scuttle ;&#xD;
and, in the corner, a turned-up bed-&#xD;
stead.&#xD;
These- were Mr. Pike's two rooms,&#xD;
and formed his only place of dwelling.&#xD;
We are led, therefore, to conclude that&#xD;
the attorney was either extremely poor&#xD;
or a remarkable miser. He was now&#xD;
alone in his office.; his posture indi-&#xD;
cated 'thought, for he * leant with his&#xD;
elbows on the 'table, his lean hands&#xD;
being buried 'beneath the bunches of&#xD;
his red hair. His hatchet face time&#xD;
had elongated, and rendered even more&#xD;
sharp ; his body, also, was more worn&#xD;
and meagre. In every other respect,&#xD;
Mr. Pike appeared the same active and&#xD;
intelligent individual he was a dozen&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
years previously. Between his elbows,&#xD;
as he stooped over the table, stood a&#xD;
small japanned iron cash-box ; on&#xD;
this object his round, brilliant, sloe&#xD;
eyes fixed themselves at times lovingly,&#xD;
while his thin, bloodless lips-for they&#xD;
had no hue in them--moved with rapid-&#xD;
ity, although no articulate 'sounds&#xD;
were produced. Pike, indeed, was a&#xD;
miser: the addition made to his annual&#xD;
income through the liberality of Hart-&#xD;
ley had awakened the desire of saving,&#xD;
and this passion steadily increased&#xD;
with his increasing hoard, and strength-&#xD;
ened with his age.&#xD;
* It is a solitary joy that of accumu-&#xD;
lation, yet an intense, soul-wrapping,&#xD;
devouring flame. The miser's raptures,&#xD;
as he gathers heap on heap, casting&#xD;
more and yet more into the great&#xD;
whole, none but the miser himself can&#xD;
understand or imagine. All other&#xD;
pleasures derived from the finer feel-&#xD;
ings, or the exercise of the mental&#xD;
faculties, seem to him poorE and profit-&#xD;
less. He lives in his gold for his gold,&#xD;
smiles over it, weeps over it, dreams of ,&#xD;
it; the only pang he. ever experiences&#xD;
is when some darker and desponding&#xD;
'moment forces upon, him the convic-&#xD;
tion that silver and gold cannot be&#xD;
taken with him beyond the confines of&#xD;
this world. Death is the cruel de-&#xD;
spoiler, theunsparing bankrupt-maker&#xD;
even of the miser.&#xD;
"Fifty-a hundred-four hundred,"&#xD;
Mr. Pike began softly to mutter.&#xD;
"Yes, I think I shall add four hundred&#xD;
pounds to the stock this year, which&#xD;
will make that sum in consols, let me&#xD;
see-ten thousand six hundred and&#xD;
fifty pounds. Is this well? No; my&#xD;
domestic expenditure has been, far too&#xD;
great during the past year. I have&#xD;
lived too well-much too freely. Why,&#xD;
the year's expenses, not including&#xD;
house-rent, amount to' no less than&#xD;
thirty pounds four shillings and three-&#xD;
pence--enormous ,wasteful! ruinous!&#xD;
I must reform."&#xD;
His brow was knit, and a dark cloud_&#xD;
settled upon it. But as his eyes glanced&#xD;
again at the cash-box, and certain'&#xD;
schemes for retrenchment or domestic&#xD;
saving passed through his mind, the&#xD;
.frown Lradually softened, until his&#xD;
wide nouth puckering upat the corners,&#xD;
a smile of deep satisfaction fairly over-&#xD;
spread his meagre visage.&#xD;
A low tapping outside of the office&#xD;
disturbed th awyer's reverie. "Comea&#xD;

me. Go. I don't care how you obtain&#xD;
the amount, so you get it. Good-day.&#xD;
Remember, three o'clock to-morrow-&#xD;
I must have my money !"&#xD;
The man left the office with a sigh,&#xD;
but Mr. Pike experienced a singular&#xD;
description of pleasure, if the smile on&#xD;
his lip might be considered an evidence&#xD;
of such satisfaction.&#xD;
" This is the way to munage the low,&#xD;
uneducated classes," he whispered.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, we must govern them by&#xD;
fear. Humanity? I am as humane&#xD;
and merciful as most men, I believe;&#xD;
but lawyers must live. Were I to&#xD;
forgive this man his debt, by the same&#xD;
rule I might extend like lenity to every&#xD;
other person -who owes me money.&#xD;
Such a proceeding would be absurd,&#xD;
highly reprehensible. I act then per-&#xD;
fectly right, and in strict accordance&#xD;
with honor, equity, virtue, and good-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
At this pleasing conclusion of Mr.&#xD;
Pike's little  self-examination, the&#xD;
worthy man smiled again. He felt,&#xD;
or imagined he felt, all that warms&#xD;
the philanthropic breast ; and he ab-&#xD;
solutely was not aware (so entirely:&#xD;
may a man deceive himself) that his&#xD;
heart was as cold as December's icicle,&#xD;
and as hard also. Another visitormade&#xD;
his appearance, but he did not belong&#xD;
to that class which Mt. Pike was ac-&#xD;
customed to browbeat. The lawyer&#xD;
instantly rose, making a profound-&#xD;
almost a servile-bow. Roland Hart-&#xD;
ley stood before him.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SECRET CoNsULTATION-HOw SHALL&#xD;
THEY RUIN EIM?&#xD;
Tims was not the first visit which&#xD;
Hartley had paid to the attorney of St.&#xD;
Mary-Axe. He called at times on Mr.&#xD;
Pike, lest the too frequent appearance&#xD;
of the latter person at his chambers&#xD;
might attract attention, or awaken&#xD;
suspicion, the character of Pike being&#xD;
known to some of the. honorable mem-.&#xD;
hers of This profession. The doors were&#xD;
made fast, and the two, drawing chairs&#xD;
close to each other, commenced their&#xD;
consultation in a low tone of voice.&#xD;
It had been a -curious, stu4g to have&#xD;
watched the varying expression, indi-&#xD;
cative of the workings of the mind,&#xD;
visible on the 'countenances of these&#xD;
&#xD;
men. Their physiognomies, as much&#xD;
as their dispositions, were opposed to&#xD;
each other. The massive features of&#xD;
Hartley, the still, reflective forehead,&#xD;
shaded by jet-black hair, and the&#xD;
down-bent eyes, were in singular con-&#xD;
trast with the sharp profile, low brow,&#xD;
red bunchy hair, and eternally restless,&#xD;
twinkling, little visual organs of Mr.&#xD;
Pike. The one was' slow, moody,&#xD;
severe, and bitter of heart; the other&#xD;
was all activity, observance, curiosity,&#xD;
and craft.An aptillustration ofthe posi-&#xD;
tion and characteristics of these men&#xD;
may be found among animals: Pike&#xD;
was the attendant jackal who scents&#xD;
and "points" the prey ; Hartley was-&#xD;
the sullen, but fierce and terrible lion.&#xD;
The lawyer stooped forward in his&#xD;
chair, listening attentively, and nod-&#xD;
ding his head from time to time, as&#xD;
Hartley disclosed to him some new&#xD;
wish he entertained, or some new duty&#xD;
which Pike would have to perform.&#xD;
" The time is come," pursued Hart-&#xD;
ley, "for this decisive step. He has,&#xD;
enjoyed his triumph long enough; and'&#xD;
she, too-she has been happy long&#xD;
enough. The wheel of fortune must&#xD;
revolve. The property shall change&#xD;
hands. Brookland Hall must be held&#xD;
by another !"&#xD;
" True," said the attorney. "I ad&#xD;
mit you are more deserving, far more&#xD;
deserving of that fine property than&#xD;
your elder brother ; therefore, in spite&#xD;
of the common notion of hereditary&#xD;
right which prevails in this country, I&#xD;
maintain the worthy and the most&#xD;
capable should inherit what their pa-&#xD;
rents leave. This is real justice ; this&#xD;
principle, if carried out, would indeed&#xD;
advance and exalt the social system."&#xD;
"You mistake me," observed Hart-&#xD;
ley, smiling; "I am neither ambitiouns&#xD;
of broad lands nor eager for the ac-&#xD;
quirement of wealth. In other words,&#xD;
I do not desire to hold Brookland&#xD;
Hall myself."&#xD;
"Not ? I marvel at it." Pike was&#xD;
indeed surprised. With his strongly&#xD;
developed organ of acquisitiveness, he&#xD;
could not well conceive how it was pos-&#xD;
sible for any man to resist coveting a&#xD;
fine old mansion and a valuable estate.&#xD;
" I merely intend, if possible, to de-&#xD;
prive the present owner of his posses-&#xD;
sion. Do not question me concerning&#xD;
my motive. I wish to place Somerset&#xD;
in a position that shall give me full&#xD;
power over his fortunes, and, perhaps,&#xD;
&#xD;
his personal liberty. We must devise&#xD;
means of bringing this about."&#xD;
"Certainly, certainly !" said Pike ;&#xD;
and in his anxiety to catch every low-&#xD;
spoken word, he slid forward to the ex-&#xD;
tremity of his chair, holding his head&#xD;
on one side.&#xD;
" The estates of my brother, though&#xD;
well cultivated, are not every large. The&#xD;
entail has been cut off ; consequently, it&#xD;
is in his power to dispose of all he&#xD;
possesses."&#xD;
"Ay, he can turn his houses and&#xD;
lands into bank-notes; I am aware of&#xD;
that."&#xD;
" Gold is a thing which slips easily&#xD;
through the fingers," pursued Hartley.&#xD;
" I am desirous that Somerset should&#xD;
spend or lose all this gold, and so-be&#xD;
driven to the necessity of borrowing.'&#xD;
Pike, judging from his own feelings&#xD;
and habits, considered such an event&#xD;
or crisis almost impossible.&#xD;
"Why, I have reason to think Mr.&#xD;
Somerset a man of sound sense ; how,&#xD;
then, may the least chance exist of our&#xD;
inducing him to part-first with his&#xD;
estates, and then to squander away the&#xD;
entire proceeds? No, no," observed&#xD;
Pike, shaking his head ; " forgive me:&#xD;
we must not, sir, because we are cau-&#xD;
tious and prudent ourselves, believe fall&#xD;
the rest of the world fools-not quite."&#xD;
"Every man, Mr. Pike, has his weak&#xD;
or vulnerable point. There is scarcely'&#xD;
a fortress, however strong, into which&#xD;
an enemy, by skilful and persevering&#xD;
efforts, may not at length win an en-&#xD;
, trance."                  -&#xD;
" True, very true.  Sage remark-&#xD;
profound philosophy."&#xD;
"I give you credit for invention, Mr.&#xD;
Pike-that is, you have a lively fancy,&#xD;
as well as deep penetration."&#xD;
The lawyer bowed at this compliment,&#xD;
and coughed. He was unable to blush,&#xD;
for his parchment visage had not be-&#xD;
trayed the crimson hue of modesty&#xD;
since boyhood.&#xD;
f 2      "Can you, therefore, devise a plan&#xD;
whereby Somerset may be induced to&#xD;
mortgage or sell his estates, and in the&#xD;
end be driven to borrow money ?".&#xD;
Pike remained silent for a few min-&#xD;
utes, his head being bent, and his&#xD;
linger placed on his chin. He was in&#xD;
profound thought.  The little crafty-&#xD;
face and the glittering eyes were raised&#xD;
at length, and he spoke slowly and&#xD;
{      cautiously.&#xD;
" May went, Mr. Hartley-may we&#xD;
&#xD;
not excite in him an ambition, to pur-&#xD;
chase more land ? May we not, by&#xD;
certain devices, draw him into ruinous&#xD;
bargains ?"&#xD;
" Pretty well,' said Hartley: "But&#xD;
such a scheme, I fear, would only em-&#xD;
barrass and impoverish, and never&#xD;
completely ruin him. Try again."&#xD;
" May we not, through certain visit-&#xD;
ors or example; inflame his vanity,&#xD;
and induce him to live in a more ex-&#xD;
pensive manner? He might build a&#xD;
new seat, give great entertainments,&#xD;
keep a pack of hounds and race-studs.&#xD;
Such a course would inevitably plunge&#xD;
him into debt."&#xD;
"No doubt of it. But that line of&#xD;
conduct, I am fully assured, Somerset&#xD;
would never pursue. Vanity, and a&#xD;
love of pleasure, are not his vulnerable&#xD;
points. I know him."&#xD;
The attorney's face suddenly beamed&#xD;
with smiles, and he clapped his hands&#xD;
together.&#xD;
" I have it !" he cried. " Let us lure&#xD;
him up to town ; let us beset him by&#xD;
'touters,' in the guise of gentlemen,&#xD;
and entice him at first to billiard-rooms,&#xD;
and then into houses of deeper play.&#xD;
No fortune can stand against the gam-&#xD;
ing-table. Once inside -a gambling-&#xD;
house, and your victim is' secured.&#xD;
Believe me, I have had some experience&#xD;
in this kind of proceeding. Not that I&#xD;
ever gamble myself-no, my principles&#xD;
oppose that-but I've crushed an ene-&#xD;
my by sending him to one of those&#xD;
fascinating sinks of perdition. I caused&#xD;
one man to cut his throat, and another&#xD;
to blow out his brains ; but all ,were&#xD;
evil-doers, and far better out of the&#xD;
world than in it. So, 'you perceive,&#xD;
such acts as mine cannot be called re-&#xD;
prehensible, sincethey bring aboutgood&#xD;
to the community at large.'. Mr. Hart-&#xD;
ley," he added, with great warmth,&#xD;
"by all means, trust to the irresistible&#xD;
spell of gaming."&#xD;
The words of Mr. Pike evidently car-&#xD;
ried weight with-them; and if ,Hart&#xD;
ley was not. quite satisfied, he never-&#xD;
theless seemed disposed to attach con-&#xD;
siderable:importance to the advice last&#xD;
given. He remained for some time&#xD;
without offering any observation, Pike&#xD;
watching the expression of his counte-&#xD;
nance with great anxiety.&#xD;
"This," said Hartley, _at length-&#xD;
"this certainlyiappears to me the best&#xD;
idea you have yet started.- But the&#xD;
scheme involves a difficulty, I fear,&#xD;

golden fancies and wild chimeraswhich&#xD;
characteried the day.,&#xD;
Somerset, we have observed, was&#xD;
standing near, the hearth wrapped in&#xD;
deep thought,:andit was-evident, from&#xD;
the sucden changes of expression visi-&#xD;
ble in his countenance, that his reflec-&#xD;
tions were of-an anxious and painful&#xD;
nature. His mind was torn by con-&#xD;
flicting feelings and sentiments. Some&#xD;
old passion was striving for the mass&#xD;
tery, and its approaches were met and&#xD;
opposed by principles and convictions'&#xD;
of a -later growth. Philosophy and&#xD;
calm prudence were at variance with&#xD;
the wild suggestions of afeverish fancy;&#xD;
indeed, the struggle going forwards&#xD;
within seemed -every moment to in-&#xD;
erease. He walked up and down the&#xD;
oom, then - approached the window&#xD;
which overlooked the; park: his eyes&#xD;
were directed to the:garden, to the fine&#xD;
clumps of -aged trees, to the groups of&#xD;
deer-but the sight no longer yielded&#xD;
him pleasure; histhoughts and feelings&#xD;
were wholly.engrossed by another snub-&#xD;
ject..&#xD;
Somerset returned to the table, and.&#xD;
stood beside it, looking earnestly on the&#xD;
pile of -miscellaneous papers, but for-&#xD;
bearing to touch them, as if they con-&#xD;
tained some terrible secret, or might,&#xD;
by contact, impart some deadly pesti-&#xD;
lence. Yet did those documents exer-&#xD;
cise upon him a spell, for he bent. over&#xD;
them nearer and nearer. Slowly and&#xD;
hesitatingly he raised one, but flung it&#xD;
down again. - His lips moved, his hand&#xD;
was pressed to his forehead ; and then&#xD;
he sank into a chair, stooping forwards,&#xD;
with his eyes fixed, and remaining in&#xD;
that posture quiet and motionless as a&#xD;
statue.-&#xD;
A man yielding to temptation, yet&#xD;
disputing, inch- by inch, the ground&#xD;
with the tempter-fiend--the study of&#xD;
such a character is ever replete with&#xD;
Interest. Yet we shall not attempt to&#xD;
enter into an analysis of the varied&#xD;
feelings and antagonistic passions call-&#xD;
ed into play within the bosom of So-&#xD;
merset.&#xD;
" I thank a Heaven for what "I pos-&#xD;
sess," he said, softly, to himself. " My&#xD;
income is amplefor all my wants; and&#xD;
yet I should be enabled to do more&#xD;
good to my fellow-creatures if I had&#xD;
ten instead of three thousand a-year.&#xD;
I have also long wished to be returned&#xD;
for the county, but. always dreaded&#xD;
the expense of a canvass. eSo, what a&#xD;

are to take pearls yearly to the amount&#xD;
of 15,0001. each ship. Deduct 50001.&#xD;
for expenses, and the net annual profit&#xD;
to be divided will amount to one mil-&#xD;
lion sterling !"&#xD;
He ceased-whispering; his eye was&#xD;
lit up, his foot beat the floor, and he&#xD;
seemed fast approaching to a determi-&#xD;
nation. But suddenly recollections as&#xD;
of some former promise or resolve re-&#xD;
curred to his mind. Gloom oversha-&#xD;
dowed his face, and he was thrown&#xD;
into the same state of cruel uncertainty-&#xD;
and irresolution as that which agitated&#xD;
him a few minutes before.&#xD;
But the door was opened, and she&#xD;
who, had license at all times to enter&#xD;
her father's library walked into the&#xD;
room. A child still in form and fea-&#xD;
ture was Hester, yet thoughtful and&#xD;
intelligent beyond her years. Her&#xD;
step was less-buoyant and giddy than&#xD;
when we last saw her. A pensiveness,&#xD;
and a habit of frequent reflection, had&#xD;
succeeded to light airs and joyous&#xD;
prattle. Her character was softened,&#xD;
but at the same- time rendered -more&#xD;
energetic, while she was capable of&#xD;
stronger feeling. Hester had remarked&#xD;
the restlessness and anxiety which had&#xD;
recently oppressed her father. What&#xD;
knew she of public companies, specu-&#xD;
lation , in mines, or pearl-fisheries ?&#xD;
Such things to her were incomprehen-&#xD;
sible mysteries, -and raised no ideas to&#xD;
excite her fancy. She only felt as-&#xD;
sured that something was wrong--that&#xD;
something in the- strange maps and&#xD;
long printed circulars -lately arrived&#xD;
drew her father's attention away from&#xD;
his usual pursuits, and.distracted his&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
- Hester had been several minutes in&#xD;
the room, and still her father did not,&#xD;
appear aware of her presence.- She&#xD;
quietly approached him  as he stood&#xD;
bending over the table.&#xD;
"What are all these papers about,&#xD;
father? They seem greatly to annoy&#xD;
you."&#xD;
qtr. Somerset returned no answer.&#xD;
"'Why do you not -speak ? Have I&#xD;

"Quite right, Mr. Somerset ; take.&#xD;
time. You, can write to the " board"&#xD;
in London by and by; and as for in-&#xD;
vestigation, we court it."&#xD;
" But," suggested Mr. Pike, rather,&#xD;
alarmed at the idea of a postponement&#xD;
of the business, "suppose the shares,.&#xD;
in the mean time; should be all sold,&#xD;
this golden opportunity lost.&#xD;
"   must, -investigate," repeated.&#xD;
Somerset,.firmly.&#xD;
'"By all means," rejoined the director.,&#xD;
A luminous thought flashed upon the&#xD;
mind of Mr. Pike.&#xD;
" Pardon me, gentlemen," .he said,&#xD;
" but listen.  In these stirring and&#xD;
glorious fimes, when every-Englishman&#xD;
possessing a small capital to start with&#xD;

The words of Pike sank into the&#xD;
heart of Somerset, and, though the&#xD;
latter made no direct'observation, these&#xD;
honeyed, crafty words were not soon 1&#xD;
forgotten. He asked a few more ques-&#xD;
tions, and invitedthem to take luncheon; 1&#xD;
so :the stout London' director and the&#xD;
little lawyer eat cold partridge, and sip-&#xD;
ped Mr. Somerset's Madeira.   Suc-&#xD;
cess was drunk to the "Great Consoli-c&#xD;

&#xD;
great director was going to make visits&#xD;
to other capitalists.  His carriage,&#xD;
with his "fellows" in the rumble,&#xD;
dashed along the gravelled terrace, the&#xD;
grays  prancing, and   the  postilion&#xD;
cracking his whip, while Mr. Somerset&#xD;
returned' to his study to  meditate and&#xD;
to dream.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FIRST sTrP DOWN THE HILL oF RUIN&#xD;
-FAREWELL TO THE COUNTRY.&#xD;
AotrT a weekhad elapsed from the&#xD;
date of our last chapter. The doors of,&#xD;
the old oak',drawingroom, already de-&#xD;
scribed in our pages, were closed. - Mr.&#xD;
Somerset was standing near a panelled&#xD;
recess, motionless as a person under&#xD;
the influence of a spell. One foot was'&#xD;
advanced, his body being drawn back,&#xD;
as if he half retreated from some object.&#xD;
His hand shaded his eyes, but the'&#xD;
lower part of his countenance, being'&#xD;
visible, expressed deep emotion and'&#xD;
pain.&#xD;
Before him, kneeling on the floor.&#xD;
and clasping his right hand in both'&#xD;
her own, was. seen his wife. Fifteen&#xD;
years younger than himself, Isabella&#xD;
was still eminently beautiful.' Her&#xD;
figure, though full, had lost none of'&#xD;
the elasticity of- early youth. Her&#xD;
complexion was very fair, and her har-&#xD;
monious features preserved their ex-&#xD;
quisite outline, their general expres-&#xD;
sion betokening great placidity of mind-&#xD;
and warmth of heart. Her eyes were=&#xD;
now raised to her husband's- face be-&#xD;
seechingly, and brimming with tears,&#xD;
and as her neck in that attitude swayr=&#xD;
backward, her hair, escaping from its&#xD;
band, fell in a black mass over her'&#xD;
shoulders. Still no word was~ spoken&#xD;
by either, 'looks being :the only lan-&#xD;
guage of Isabella. -But Somerset&#xD;
averted his- face gradually more and'&#xD;
more, unable to withstand the pleading-&#xD;
of those beloved and eloquent eyes.&#xD;
The rays of the evening sun, steal-&#xD;
ng through the gold-fringed damask&#xD;
curtains, fell upon them. The very air&#xD;
seemed glowing and soft, until their&#xD;
[russ and their features assumed that&#xD;
deep rich peculiar -tint which charac-&#xD;
erizes the picture-groups of the paint-&#xD;
er Murillo.&#xD;
"Isabella," sa  Somerset, at length,&#xD;

trials, nor sufferings, shall ever entirely&#xD;
dissolve.&#xD;
She approaches the fountain where&#xD;
the gold and silver fish are sporting,&#xD;
revived.by the return of sunshine. She&#xD;
does not stoop to plunge her arms&#xD;
playfully into the sparkling waters&#xD;
now, but stands pensively looking at&#xD;
the crowd of little finny inhabitants&#xD;
who, perceiving her, and expecting the&#xD;
wonted crumbs, flock to the surface&#xD;
with their crimson gleaming backs.&#xD;
Hark! to the note of the canary, as&#xD;
from his suspended cage within the&#xD;
grotto he welcomes his mistress. She&#xD;
will not, at least, part with him, and&#xD;
he is destined to accompany her to the&#xD;
great city.. Go! bird,. go! nor regret&#xD;
the sparry home thou dost leave, for&#xD;
thou wilt be a solace to thy mistress in&#xD;
many a coming weary hour; and while&#xD;
she listens- to thy plaintive note, the&#xD;
tears will stand still upon- the heavy&#xD;
lids of sorrow, and dreams of home-&#xD;
that which wasonce her home--will call&#xD;
up a smile on her faded cheek..&#xD;
Hester leans against the pedestal&#xD;
which supports the statue of the wood-&#xD;
nymph. Here long ago Lewis %Banks&#xD;
had concealed himself when he entered&#xD;
the garden by stealth. Her eyes are&#xD;
fixed on the spot where she well recol-&#xD;
lects he stood. His .image is before-&#xD;
her; his coarse little jacket, his heavy&#xD;
shoes, his fine intellectual face, and his&#xD;
bold, independent bearing, .all are&#xD;
present to the gaze of her ardent&#xD;
imagination. Her arms are listlessly&#xD;
leant on the smooth surface of their&#xD;
pedestal; her dress, worn longer nowl&#xD;
and more closely fitting, displays only&#xD;
her taper feet, and one of them, during&#xD;
that abstraction or wandering of the&#xD;
mind, is raised slowly up and down.&#xD;
Gone--gone"--said Hester, in a&#xD;
scarcely audible whisper-" to a distant &#xD;
land, they say, where suns are hotter&#xD;
than they are here, and wars, which hec&#xD;

be; I only know that-I dream of him, f&#xD;
hope for him, pray for him, and that i&#xD;
nothing in the world will ever cause&#xD;
me to forget what is past, even if I i&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
&#xD;
BUSY LIFE IN LONDON--ROLAND HARTLEY&#xD;
VISiTS HIS VIETIMs.&#xD;
Ir was mid-day in the great metropo-&#xD;
lis. Life was everywhere; but in some&#xD;
localities beyond others the stir, the&#xD;
toil, the energy of animal existence,&#xD;
made themselves apparent. A tide of *&#xD;
human beings was pouring through&#xD;
Fleet-street, chafing arnd-fretting be-&#xD;
neath the -contracted archways of vene-&#xD;
rable Temple-bar, sweeping through&#xD;
the Strand, rushing up and down the&#xD;
multitudinous streets and   avenues&#xD;
which branch therefrom, arms : and&#xD;
tributaries, as it . were, of the great&#xD;
main current. Then the mighty human&#xD;
river, having reached Charing-cross,&#xD;
divided itself into two principal chan-&#xD;
nels, the one stretching on to West-&#xD;
minster, and the other flowing up Pall-&#xD;
mall and Regent-street. All the time,&#xD;
as in the natural stream an adverse&#xD;
current frequently sets by the sides,&#xD;
there was a backward eddy of parties&#xD;
hurrying in the opposite direction, so&#xD;
that the motion, turmoil, and general&#xD;
confusion were incessant.&#xD;
With the exception of a few loiterers&#xD;
around the print-shops, -and in front of&#xD;
small hotels, every one seemed busy on-&#xD;
his own account. Every man appeared&#xD;
a strange- to his neighbor. None&#xD;
cared which - way his fellow  went,&#xD;
provided he could advance with due&#xD;
celerity on his own path. Each. indi--&#xD;
vidual, in short, was a little world in&#xD;
himself; yes, not one of those countless&#xD;
heads, thick as "leaves in Vallombrosa,"&#xD;
but -was a..microcosm, full of hopes,&#xD;
fears, schemes, and ambitions. His&#xD;
nterests, his fortunes, were all in all.&#xD;
,The old and the young seemed alike&#xD;
nfected with-this, malady of restless-&#xD;
ness, and to lie under a spell or curse&#xD;
embodied in the words, "Stay not,&#xD;
hink not, but press onwards."'&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
And is it always so? may ask. a&#xD;
visitor from the country; ay, always,&#xD;
if we except a very few hours during&#xD;
the night; and even then this great&#xD;
thoroughfare is never deserted, for in&#xD;
those hours abound early marketmen,&#xD;
police-constables, houseless wanderers,&#xD;
the drunken returning from their revels,&#xD;
women of dissolute character, and very-&#xD;
frequently small armies of paviors and,&#xD;
sewer-men, who must prosecute their&#xD;
labor while others are supposed to sleep.&#xD;
Sunday closes the shop fronts, though&#xD;
not all, and diminishes the amount of&#xD;
toil; but still the multitude is there;&#xD;
the carriage, the many-formed vehicle&#xD;
for the people, and the pleasure-seekers,&#xD;
pour along. And thus has it been for&#xD;
unnumbered years, for ages, no  inter-&#xD;
mission, no repose, in the great and&#xD;
ancient metropolitan highway of the&#xD;
Strand. A busy being, nowstays his&#xD;
course, and - dies; another takes his&#xD;
place ; the last hastens by the little&#xD;
burial-grounds of St. Clement-Dane&#xD;
and St. Mary-le-Strand, but he thinks&#xD;
not.of his brother who may rest there.&#xD;
A generation passes away; a generation&#xD;
of nep;faces succeeds, as full of activity&#xD;
and recklessness as that which went&#xD;
before. Again and again this process'&#xD;
is repeated. The wheel eternally moves,&#xD;
..     around. The man of to-day toils, and&#xD;
earns his money; the past is nothing,&#xD;
'M      the present to him is everything. He&#xD;
asks no sympathy, for he seems wholly&#xD;
unconscious of the perishing nature of&#xD;
[       things around him, and the;mutability&#xD;
of his own lot. Philosophy only, like&#xD;
another Xerxes, surveys the crowd, and&#xD;
sighs over their inevitable fate.&#xD;
Emerging from beneath Temple-&#xD;
bar, and proceeding west, might have&#xD;
been seen an individual who, though&#xD;
among the throng, appeared by no&#xD;
means in that state of excitement and&#xD;
bustle which affected others.- His step&#xD;
was slow, but .not listless or loitering.-&#xD;
Others elbowed him on one side, yet-&#xD;
he neither resented nor was aware of-&#xD;
that sometimes   necessary; though=&#xD;
rather -uncourteous, usage. The jeW&#xD;
eller's glittering mart, and-the enticing&#xD;
picture-shop, were alike passed by un-&#xD;
noticed. His eyes "seemed rather en-&#xD;
gaged'in counting the flat stones of&#xD;
the pavement than in ranging over the&#xD;
divers attractive and-lively scenes by&#xD;
which he was surrounded.&#xD;
Yet, the person was not a philan-&#xD;
thropi'st, or a sage mourning over the&#xD;
75&#xD;
&#xD;
57&#xD;
&#xD;
follies of the human race ; nor'was he&#xD;
a politician, or great moneyed specula-&#xD;
tor. We recognize in the man Roland&#xD;
Hartley: he was pondering on his&#xD;
favorite theme, congratulating himself&#xD;
on the success of his plans, and weav-&#xD;
ing in=his mind the web by which his&#xD;
revenge, the spider-reptile, was to&#xD;
capture his victims. To obtain a few&#xD;
minutes' release from the crowd, he&#xD;
now passed under one of the heavy&#xD;
arches which lead into the great court&#xD;
or area of Somerset House. This vast&#xD;
pile of Italian architecture, raised by&#xD;
Sir William Chambers, in 1778,-on the:&#xD;
site of the Duke of Somerset's palace,&#xD;
affords a most welcome refuge to the&#xD;
wayfarer from the noise and tumult of&#xD;
the Strand. Here he may collect his&#xD;
thoughts, and meditate in comparative.&#xD;
quietness ; a. colony of tame pigeons&#xD;
only will be constantly flying around&#xD;
him, or perching, perhaps, at his feet,&#xD;
in expectation of being fed. Hartley&#xD;
paced before the  numerous public&#xD;
offices into which the spacious building&#xD;
is divided ; but dismissing other sub-&#xD;
jects of reflection, he now yielded to&#xD;
the promptings of his unreturned and&#xD;
defeated passion-that. strange endur-&#xD;
ing love which still burned, like lava,&#xD;
in his breast ; and then he exulted in&#xD;
his approaching triumph over his rival&#xD;
and enemy.&#xD;
"I will go-1 will linger no longer;&#xD;
I will once again ravish my eyes with&#xD;
her fatal beauty. I will address him&#xD;
kindly, and proffer-yes, a show of&#xD;
friendship will increase my power over&#xD;
him tenfold. I will wind around them&#xD;
both the chain of their destiny ; they'&#xD;
shall never escape me.''&#xD;
Such were the thoughts which passed&#xD;
through Hartley's mind as he quitted&#xD;
Somerset House, and turned again into&#xD;
the busy Strand. About twenty mi-&#xD;
nutes' walking brought him into Pall-&#xD;
mall; and, passing through St. James's&#xD;
Square, he knocked ai the door of a&#xD;
house in Jermyn-street;&#xD;
"Is Mr. Somerset at home ?" asked&#xD;
Hartley&#xD;
'The footman replied in the' affirma-&#xD;
tive; and, in a few minutes, Hartley&#xD;
was in the drawing-room-alone.&#xD;
'he feelings which- for. an instant&#xD;
crowded upon him we attempt not to&#xD;
portray. He was in the house of his&#xD;
foe ; the man whom, by a train of ma-&#xD;
noeuvres which, he had brooded over&#xD;
for years, he intended to crush., Gall&#xD;

was in his heart, but honey was now&#xD;
to distil from hislips. As he thought&#xD;
of the approaching scene, his brow&#xD;
darkened and contracted from an uncon-&#xD;
quered feeling of hatred, and his frame&#xD;
was agitated, by, the secret passion&#xD;
which he indulged. - But these out-&#xD;
ward revealings of-what passed within&#xD;
were quickly subdued, and he stood&#xD;
prepared for the part. he resolved to&#xD;
perform.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset entered the room. His&#xD;
surprise at seeing his brother was&#xD;
great ; but whether the visit were made&#xD;
with a view of establishing between&#xD;
them a friendly intercourse suspended&#xD;
during so many years, or whether Hart-&#xD;
ley had some unpleasant business to&#xD;
transact, he was entirely at a loss to&#xD;
imagine.  A quiet smile overspread&#xD;
Somerset's face, and seemed the index&#xD;
of unmistakable kindly feelings ; he did&#xD;
not, however, extend his hand to Hart-&#xD;
ley lest the courtesy, as on a former oc-&#xD;
casion, should not be returned.&#xD;
"Hugh, hearing that you and your&#xD;
family have come to town," said Hart-&#xD;
ley, in a subdued tone of voice, " I&#xD;
take the liberty of calling on you just&#xD;
to bid you welcome, and to offer-that&#xD;
is, if you do not greatly object-any&#xD;
poor services of mine that might con-&#xD;
duce towards rendering your . visit&#xD;
agreeable."&#xD;
Such friendly -language was so en-&#xD;
tirely unexpected from  the gloomy&#xD;
ascetic of the Temple, and from one&#xD;
who, Somerset had every reason to be-&#xD;
lieve, regarded him with unmitigated&#xD;
aversion, that he could only stare on&#xD;
the speaker without offering any ob-&#xD;
servation.&#xD;
"I know," pursued the hypocrite,&#xD;
"that on many occasions I have ex-&#xD;
pressed myself, and behaved towards&#xD;
you, in an unbrotherly manner. But,&#xD;
believe me, the bitterness of past&#xD;
days has long ceased:-I perceive my&#xD;
error, and heartily repent of the hos-&#xD;
tile feelings once cherished by me. I&#xD;
am ignorant of your own sentiments,&#xD;
but I frankly acknowledge I am the&#xD;
aggressor, and, if not too late, wish&#xD;
now for reconciliation and peace."&#xD;
Somerset, though taken by surprise,&#xD;
did not for an instant doubt the genu-&#xD;
ineness of Hartley's overtures of friend-&#xD;
ship; his unsuspecting nature was at&#xD;
once blinded and deceived, and his&#xD;
generous? heart subdued; -warmeet.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
cited her sympathy, and rendered him&#xD;
almost an object of interest in her&#xD;
eyes. Ah! could she have rent away&#xD;
the shrouding veil, and beheld the&#xD;
blackness, the hell within that bosom ;&#xD;
recognized there the friendly spirit that&#xD;
strove to) hurry on her father to ruin,&#xD;
that would one day turn her mother's&#xD;
gentleness into something worse than'&#xD;
the ravings of anguish, and follow her&#xD;
own steps in the world with unceasing&#xD;
persecution, heaping on her head trial&#xD;
after trial-how would she have shrunk&#xD;
into herself I while that young fair face,&#xD;
instead of wreathing with smiles, as&#xD;
she gazed on the human monster, would&#xD;
have been blanched with dismay.&#xD;
&#xD;
emotions filled his bat6in, while his&#xD;
eyes beamed with unmingled delight.&#xD;
"Roland ! my brother, my longer&#xD;
estranged beloved brother !" he cried,&#xD;
grasping Hartley's hand, " this is grati-&#xD;
fication indeed ; this is pleasure, the&#xD;
extent of which I have not words to&#xD;
describe. You know I loved you yeats&#xD;
ago, and would have done anything&#xD;
to repair the sad breach between us.&#xD;
That [ pardon-no, such a word shall&#xD;
not be uttered by me-that I love you&#xD;
still deeply, truly, affectionately, let&#xD;
the old man's tear (for I am old com-&#xD;
pared with you), and this embrace bear&#xD;
witness."&#xD;
With all the abandonment and frater-&#xD;
nal fondness of a too trusting heart, he&#xD;
passed his arm over the shoulder of&#xD;
Hartley, and leant on his neck. An&#xD;
enemy entering his rival's country, bent&#xD;
on hostility but feigning peace ; a Judas&#xD;
saluting with a kiss while resolving to&#xD;
betray ; a coiled-up serpent counterfeit-&#xD;
ing sleep when meditating only the&#xD;
fatal spring-such was Hartley in his&#xD;
brother's house.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset, impelled    by  the&#xD;
warmth of his feelings, called his wife,&#xD;
who quickly appeared ; Hester, too,&#xD;
with her lithe airy figure, presently&#xD;
tripped into the room. Isabella had&#xD;
never credited in times past the&#xD;
statements of Hartley; she believed&#xD;
his disposition essentially depraved,&#xD;
subtlety,hardness ofheart, and agloomy&#xD;
moroseness appearing to her its lead-&#xD;
ing characteristics. With the intuitive&#xD;
quickness and penetration of her sex,.&#xD;
she half saw now through the disguise&#xD;
he had assumed.   That her husband-&#xD;
had long ardently desired to be recon-&#xD;
ciled to his brother was well known to&#xD;
her, therefore it would have given her&#xD;
great pain to have raised obstacles, and&#xD;
become a bar between them. Feeling&#xD;
this, she returned the greeting of Hart-&#xD;
ley with as much cordiality as she was&#xD;
able to show ; yet, as his searching&#xD;
eyes were bent upon her, and his&#xD;
fevered hand touched hers, a shudder&#xD;
crept through herframe, while astrange&#xD;
sense of fear, like a presentiment of&#xD;
coming evil, oppressed her heart.&#xD;
Hester did not share her mother's&#xD;
feelings, but responded to the welcome&#xD;
of her father's brother with the frank&#xD;
and open spirit peculiar to the young.&#xD;
She regarded him as unfortunate, and&#xD;
the victim of some secret and unex-&#xD;
plained sorrow; indeed this belief ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. SOMERSET AT THE STOCK EXCHANGE--&#xD;
THE CONFIDENTIAL DINNER.&#xD;
Ir was a busy day on the Stock Ex-&#xD;
change. A great fluctuation prevailed&#xD;
in the prices of stocks,.,and the prices&#xD;
of all manner of shares in the foreign&#xD;
mines, canals, and other public com-1&#xD;
panies which had recently sprung into&#xD;
existence.&#xD;
Bartholomew-lane was alive with&#xD;
human beings, all in quick motion.&#xD;
Here, speculators, face. to face, were&#xD;
eagerly debating ; there, brokers, with&#xD;
slips of paper in their hands, were&#xD;
running to their respective offices in'&#xD;
the neighborhood, and anon hurrying&#xD;
back again. Men, becoming thirsty&#xD;
through excitement, were rushing to&#xD;
the- coffee-houses around- the corner,&#xD;
calling for soda-water and lemonade,&#xD;
and then, like the brokers, returning&#xD;
to the scene of action.&#xD;
The entrance of Capel-court, in Bar-&#xD;
tholomew-lane-and Capel-court is the&#xD;
stronghold of the jobbers, members of&#xD;
the Stock Exchange only having access&#xD;
to the spacious building at the further&#xD;
end-the entrance strikingly resembled&#xD;
the aperture of a beehive when beaten&#xD;
by a stick, and all the honeyed inhabit-&#xD;
ants rush out, and round about, hum-&#xD;
ming in curiosity and alarm. Only to&#xD;
have gazed upon that crowd of eager,&#xD;
bustling men, would have been suffi-&#xD;
cient to give an indifferent spectator,&#xD;
the vertigo, and he might, at least,&#xD;
have imagined that the fate of king-&#xD;
doms depended upon the result of their&#xD;
&#xD;
59&#xD;
&#xD;
proceedings. Then the divers passions&#xD;
making themselves visible in the ex&#xD;
pression of men's countenances and the&#xD;
motion of their bodies : here suspense,&#xD;
as the value of-shares fluctuated, might&#xD;
be read in quivering lips, the contraction&#xD;
of muscles, and the unceasing restless-&#xD;
ness and trembling of limbs. There,&#xD;
as some good bargain was struck, ex-&#xD;
ultant joy flashed forth in sparkling&#xD;
eyes, in the brisk rubbing together of&#xD;
hands, and the bold throwing back of&#xD;
heads. Anon, as certain stocks fell,&#xD;
in which some unhappy holders had&#xD;
staked their all, white faces, set'teeth,&#xD;
and clenched hands, betrayed the in-&#xD;
ward struggle of exasperation and die-&#xD;
spair.&#xD;
Such was the picture which this&#xD;
great theatre of insane speculation dis-&#xD;
played a short time previously to the&#xD;
memorable commercial panic of 1825.&#xD;
And whose gray head is that among&#xD;
the crowd in Capel-court? He is not&#xD;
noisy ; he seldom speaks, but he watches&#xD;
the proceedings, and listens to the float-&#xD;
ing rumors with intense eagerness. He&#xD;
changes his position with feverish anx-&#xD;
iety, and frequently walks' away to&#xD;
the office of a certain broker in the&#xD;
neighborhood, to give, - perhaps, in-&#xD;
structions as to the shares which that&#xD;
gentleman shall purchase for him ; but&#xD;
speedily he returns.  Now he -looks&#xD;
through his spectacles, now over them;&#xD;
smiles joyously, but the next moment'&#xD;
frowns; and then he takes off his hat&#xD;
to wipe away, with his silk handker-&#xD;
chief, the great drops of perspiration&#xD;
which the excitement of the occasion&#xD;
has drawn out on his forehead.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset, led on by degrees, and&#xD;
yielding little by little, had now fairly&#xD;
delivered himself up to the Tempter.&#xD;
The passion of younger days, long&#xD;
kept, in subjection or in a state of&#xD;
torpidity, had revived, and in that re-&#xD;
snscitation acquired a tenfold energy.&#xD;
Not content with joining a few comh-&#xD;
panies, he bought shares in almost half&#xD;
the schemes brought into the market.&#xD;
To raise money for the purchase, and&#xD;
to pay the consequent "calls," he had,&#xD;
unknown to his wife, sold out his family&#xD;
stock, and even mortgaged' his estate&#xD;
of Brookland Hall. The course he was&#xD;
pursuing was ruinous-frightful; and&#xD;
yet, all the time, he never entertained.&#xD;
the slightest doubt of realizing in the&#xD;
issue a large fortune.&#xD;
There was another individual well&#xD;

&#xD;
known to us among 4hat crowd. Mr.&#xD;
Pike was in the court among the Jews,&#xD;
busily at work. His sharp eyes con-&#xD;
stantly followed the movements of Mr,&#xD;
Somerset. Unobserved by the latter,&#xD;
he dogged him everywhere-his evil&#xD;
genius, his. Mephistophiles. Mr. Pike&#xD;
had still one object in view. Assisted-&#xD;
in his task by several Jews, who, for a&#xD;
small remuneration, agreed to abet him,&#xD;
he endeavored, by circulating good ac,-&#xD;
counts of certain American mines or&#xD;
Spanish bonds, to induce Mr. Somerset&#xD;
to purchase in the same : then, as soon&#xD;
as-he ascertained he had done so, the&#xD;
tables were reversed; for he and his&#xD;
Jews ran about, as if intelligence had&#xD;
only that instant arrived, deploring the&#xD;
failure of the gold veins, the vanishing&#xD;
of the silver lodes, and the complete&#xD;
bankrupt condition of the Spanishna-&#xD;
tion. By means like these, such was&#xD;
the feverish, state of the times, prices&#xD;
rose and fell to so great an extent that&#xD;
it was no uncommon thing for parties&#xD;
to gain or losethousands in an hour.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset that day, through the in-&#xD;
defatigable but unsuspected exertions&#xD;
of Pike and his Hebrews, lost, four.&#xD;
thousand pounds,!&#xD;
The money-market was over ; the&#xD;
doors of the inner pandemonium were.&#xD;
closed, and the crowd was gone.,&#xD;
We must enter a gay-looking mansion&#xD;
at the west end of the town. There&#xD;
were footrien with powdered heads,&#xD;
and men out of livery-; , there was&#xD;
elegant:furniture; there were statues&#xD;
and valuable paintings-everything&#xD;
bespoke luxury and wealth.,&#xD;
The master ofthehouse had finished&#xD;
his; dinner, and;was seatedover his&#xD;
wine, in company with one friend.&#xD;
The face of Mr. Abercrombie, natu-&#xD;
raly broad and f orid, was flushed with&#xD;
the good cheer of whieb he.had par-&#xD;
takgen, Even the thin:sallow, visage of&#xD;
Mr.Pike: had caught, in.its ext me&#xD;
points, a -slight rosy tint,, So seldom&#xD;
did the latter gentleman afford himself&#xD;
a good dinner, that the one he bad just,&#xD;
eaten had, caused his impeverished-&#xD;
blood to circulate in anunusualmanner&#xD;
throughhis withered veins.&#xD;
The ex-cheesemonger, the great direc-&#xD;
tor of the famous Diamond Company of&#xD;
Brazil, had been remarkablyconle-&#xD;
scending and affable in his communica-&#xD;
tions with Mr. Pike, whose sagacity&#xD;
he daily appreciated. They had talked&#xD;
much during the dinner; but now the&#xD;
&#xD;
hearts-of both being opened by the&#xD;
generous wines, their conversation was&#xD;
less reserved, and they imparted to&#xD;
each other- their secrets in, the most&#xD;
trusting manner possible. Mr. Aber-&#xD;
crombie, resting both his elbows on the&#xD;
table, and leaning towards Pike, looked&#xD;
inquiringly into his face.&#xD;
"So you don't think he can be induced&#xD;
to venture another five thousand, do&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Impossible; he; is in difficulties,&#xD;
already-his.estate is mortgaged. You&#xD;
must be content with the ten thousand&#xD;
you have already gained of his money."&#xD;
"Good; but I've only ninety thou-&#xD;
sand pounds in my hands. However,.&#xD;
this sum  is better than nothing. I&#xD;
wish, Pike, you would accompany me&#xD;
to the other side of the water."&#xD;
"No, I thank you.. I would rather&#xD;
keep the little I possess snugly at&#xD;
home,,than surround*myself with lux-&#xD;
uries in a foreign. land."&#xD;
"Well, every man to his taste* I&#xD;
like display ; it's my hobby, and I&#xD;
don't wish to hoard."&#xD;
"You'll pay me the two thousand=too&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
" Certainly; that is, when you have.,&#xD;
obtained, my passports, and we have&#xD;
laid everything in right train."&#xD;
"Leave that business to me," said&#xD;
Mr. Pike. "Of course I do nothing&#xD;
wrong in assisting you tofget off, since,&#xD;
if youdid not take this money, the&#xD;
other directors most certainly would.&#xD;
I consider you the most worthy man&#xD;
of the 'board,' and therefore entitled,&#xD;
on moral-grounds, to-carry off the cash&#xD;
in preference to your fellows. This is,&#xD;
mysview of the case," added-the law;&#xD;
yer; "this seems to me equity and jus-&#xD;
tice."&#xD;
Mr. Abercrombie -smiled a pleasant.&#xD;
smile, and, filling his. glass,. winked&#xD;
and nodded his large bead-several.&#xD;
times, for agreeable thoughts-werepass.&#xD;

Mr. Pike's parchment face exhibited&#xD;
a broad grin. Hetdrank the toast, and,&#xD;
presently, in a whisper; proposed one&#xD;
himself.--.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RUINED SPECULATOR.&#xD;
MR. SoMERsET, in great nervous ex-&#xD;
citement, was poring ove1r the morning&#xD;
papers. They might inform -him  of&#xD;
something which possibly had transpir-&#xD;
ed in the city,-since he-left on the after-&#xD;
noon of the preceding day.&#xD;
A few months spent in that inces-&#xD;
sant change from hope to disappoint-&#xD;
ment, from success to failure, conse-&#xD;
quent onppeculation, had deepened the&#xD;
wrinkles on his forehead, and added&#xD;
considerably to his gray hairs. Pro-,&#xD;
ject after project, in which he had en-,&#xD;
gaged had burst like bubbles. Foreign&#xD;
loans and Mexican mines had alike to&#xD;
him proved ruinous affairs. He seemed&#xD;
fated never to turn up a fortunate card.&#xD;
Still he clung with desperate tenacity,&#xD;
like -a wrecked seaman embracing a&#xD;
floating spar, to all of hope which was&#xD;
left him ; and chiefly that hope was&#xD;
placed on the Great Diamond Company&#xD;
of Brazil.&#xD;
We saw Mr, Somerset, on one occa-&#xD;
sion, busily engaged in calculating&#xD;
what his gains might be; now the pro-&#xD;
cess was reversed-he was counting his&#xD;
losse l     -&#xD;
The money raised by the sale of his&#xD;
stock was absorbed; the advance for&#xD;
which his house and lands stood mort-&#xD;
gaged had melted away, He could not&#xD;
command another hundred pounds in&#xD;
the world; and--harrowing thought&#xD;
for an honest and fond heart-his wife&#xD;
and child knew nothing yet of the state&#xD;
of his affairs. On the contrary, the&#xD;
elated spirits which he usually dis-&#xD;
played in their presence led them to&#xD;
conclude that high success attended, his&#xD;
undertakings.&#xD;
-Newspapers and price-currents drop-&#xD;
ped from his trembling hands. The&#xD;
gray-headed ifian leant back in his chair&#xD;
and sighed. He thought of Brookland&#xD;
Hall, and the quiet pursuits he once&#xD;
followed there. He compared that&#xD;
life with the turbulent scenes amid&#xD;
which he had passed the last six'&#xD;
months. And what .was the reward&#xD;
&#xD;
61&#xD;
&#xD;
for the sacrifice he had made ?-what&#xD;
the result of his toil? Must they be&#xD;
utter ruin? No ! he would not yet&#xD;
yield, he would not despair. The altar&#xD;
of hope still burned, and he would feed&#xD;
it with the oil of perseverance.&#xD;
"These large shares in the Diamond&#xD;
Company of Brazil will retrieve all,"&#xD;
he said to himself. " The concern must&#xD;
succeed ; the profits must be very great.&#xD;
Abercrombie is a shrewd man, a man&#xD;
of powerful intellect. I am glad he is&#xD;
at the head of the 'board'  No, I'll&#xD;
not sell my shares. The profits of the&#xD;
first year, unless I am very greatly mis-&#xD;
taken, will enable me to reinvest the&#xD;
old amount of stock, and, perhaps,&#xD;
purchase back Brookland Hall."&#xD;
He rose from his seat reassured, his&#xD;
usual firmness returned, and a bright&#xD;
smile took the place of the recent cloud&#xD;
of sorrow on his brow. About half an&#xD;
hour passed, during which he was in-&#xD;
dulging in happy reveries, when a ser-&#xD;
vant knocked at the door, and delivered&#xD;
to him a note, brought, he said,,by a&#xD;
messenger from the city. Eagerly Mr.&#xD;
Somerset opened it, for the handwriting&#xD;
was that of his broker, and, as the ser-&#xD;
vant retired, he read as follows:-&#xD;
"Sin-It is my painful duty to in-&#xD;
form you of a fact only this morning&#xD;
come to light. Mr. Abercrombie, the&#xD;
chairman of the 'Great Diamond.Com-&#xD;
pany of Brazil and Gold-Dust Associa-&#xD;
tion of South Africa,' had been absent&#xD;
from the office for the last, three days&#xD;
on account, it was stated, of indisposi-&#xD;
tion. ('Poor fellow 1' said Somerset;&#xD;
'J am sorry for it ; I'll go and-see him.")&#xD;
It now appears, on the other directors&#xD;
opening the strong-bdx to pay into&#xD;
their bankers all bills and moneys ad-&#xD;
vanced to the company, they find the&#xD;
said box entirely empty. On applica-&#xD;
tion at the bankers, they likewise find&#xD;
that Abercrombie, who had power to&#xD;
draw checks with one countersign, has&#xD;
swept away and cleared the whole ac-&#xD;
count. In short, it has been ascer-&#xD;
tamed, beyond the shadow of a doubt,&#xD;
that the said Abercrombie has de-&#xD;
camped with the company's entire&#xD;
effects. He obtained passports to the&#xD;
continent under a false name ; pursuit&#xD;
is considered useless, since the authori-&#xD;
ties abroad will not give him  ups;&#xD;
therefore the remaining directors, being&#xD;
insolvent, have closed their offices, and&#xD;

Like a man suddenly overpowere&#xD;
by some deadly intoxicating liquid&#xD;
like a duellist who receives his antago&#xD;
nist's ball in his heart, so Mr. Somer&#xD;
set staggered, still holding the fata&#xD;
letter in his grasp. He endeavored t&#xD;
support himself by leaning his weigh&#xD;
on both his hands upon the table. H&#xD;
did not utter an exclamation or even a&#xD;
groan. His heart was riven with an&#xD;
anguish which had no words. The&#xD;
shock had caused a vertigo, which&#xD;
every moment increased until all ideas&#xD;
were obliterated from his brain.. He&#xD;
gave one wild stare around him, and&#xD;
then the unhappy schemer, the less&#xD;
criminal than thoughtless, the man&#xD;
irremediably ruined, sank insensible&#xD;
on the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ANGLER ENSNARES HIS PREY.&#xD;
&#xD;
BLESSINGS On the forgiving heart of&#xD;
woman! She may feel mueh, upbraid&#xD;
much, and weep long, when suddenly&#xD;
plunged, by the errors of those she loves,&#xD;
from happiness or wealth, into the gulf&#xD;
of misery and poverty. Yet soon does&#xD;
the harshness soften away, the tear&#xD;
dry up, and she is ready to soothe, in-&#xD;
stead of to ask consolation herself;&#xD;
ready to -battle with fate, and face the&#xD;
pitiless storm of fortune, forgetting her&#xD;
former luxuries and "dainty estate,"&#xD;
all but -her affection, whether that af-&#xD;
fection warm the bosom of the wife,&#xD;
the mother, or the child.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset was supported in the&#xD;
arms of Isabella and Hester. They&#xD;
had heard from his lips the confession&#xD;
of his mad, deeds, and the tale of his&#xD;
ruin. They knew Brookland Hall was&#xD;
no longer their home, and that they&#xD;
were reduced to poverty, perhaps ab-&#xD;
solute want. Yet natural feelings of&#xD;
anguish were forgotten in their regard&#xD;
and anxiety for him they loved ; and&#xD;
M. Somerset, instead of being bitterly&#xD;
reproached, as he expected, instead of&#xD;
beholding them borne down by a flood&#xD;
of unavailing sorrow, received condole-&#xD;
ment at their hands. Such a return&#xD;
&#xD;
h 'for his;folly increased his love, but, at&#xD;
the same time, deepened his-remorse.&#xD;
Somerset was a man of high honor&#xD;
and stern principle ; he was therefore&#xD;
resolved to meet all his liabilities, and&#xD;
d settle his affairs in a straightforward&#xD;
, manner. Convinced of his errors, he&#xD;
- would withdraw  entirely from  the'&#xD;
vortex of speculation, and gain his liv-&#xD;
1 ing by'his own endeavors in some&#xD;
o honest way.&#xD;
t   One evening, as. he was arranging&#xD;
e his accounts, and pondering on the&#xD;
probable manner in which he should&#xD;
now earn his bread, Roland Hartley&#xD;
entered his room. There was a singu-&#xD;
lar expression on the face of the latter;&#xD;
a deep studier of the human physiog-&#xD;
nomy might have been baffled in his&#xD;
aim to read the perplexing page it pre-&#xD;
sented. There was an endeavor to&#xD;
tranquillize and soften the hard fea-&#xD;
tures, as if the spirit felt sorrow' and&#xD;
sympathy ; yet a sneer half wreathed&#xD;
the lip, and the heart within, bounding&#xD;
with exultation, sent a fiery light into&#xD;
the eje.&#xD;
"Roland, I am glad you have called,"&#xD;
said Somerset, rising. " I want much&#xD;
to consult with you. Come, I am aware&#xD;
you know of my losses. I don't wish&#xD;
to make a secret of my position, at&#xD;
least to you. In a word, Roland, you&#xD;
see before you a ruined man !"&#xD;
'KNot so; not quite so, I hope," ob-&#xD;
served the hypocritical Hartley.&#xD;
"Yes, a mad dreamer-a man who&#xD;
weakly yielded to temptation, and who&#xD;
now reaps the harvest of his deeds in&#xD;
misery and disgrace."&#xD;
" Do not despond: something must&#xD;
be done."&#xD;
"True, something shall be done.&#xD;
I will pay every penny that I owe."&#xD;
Hartley moved uneasily, and knit&#xD;
his brow, but he instantly checked&#xD;
himself. If Somerset, indeed,, paid&#xD;
" every penny," he should be cheated&#xD;
of half of his revenge.&#xD;
" Excellent ! I am delighted. Then&#xD;
you think you can discharge all your&#xD;
liabilities ? " You are quite sure of this&#xD;
-" added Hartley, endeavoring to&#xD;
lead his brother on.&#xD;
" Why, I will do it. The truth is, I&#xD;
have delivered up Brookland Hall to&#xD;
the mortgagee ; the struggle. was a&#xD;
hard one; but--but---" stammered the&#xD;
poor man, "it can't be helped. I have&#xD;
since, with my remaining property, met&#xD;
every claim except--"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Except--" repeated Hartley, look- not worth a straw.  The coveted op&#xD;
ing keenly at Somerset from beneath his portunity presented itself-the wished&#xD;
bushy brows.                       for moment had arrived,. He might&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSET..&#xD;
&#xD;
some difficulty, through the interest of&#xD;
a friend, he obtained an engagement as&#xD;
a contributor to the columns of an&#xD;
evening paper. His talents and his&#xD;
industry were appreciated, and he was&#xD;
shortly appointed to a permanentsitua-&#xD;
tion in the newspaper-office.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset took a small house, or&#xD;
rather cottage, in the suburbs of Lon-:&#xD;
don, at the very moderate rent of twenty&#xD;
pounds per annum. Here Isabella and&#xD;
Hester domiciled  themselves.  The&#xD;
contrast of this cottage in the Holloway-&#xD;
road, with its four little windows in&#xD;
front, and -patch of garden, six yards&#xD;
square, to their late residence of Brook-&#xD;
land Hall, might be very striking, but&#xD;
the wife, as was natural to expect, felt&#xD;
the  difference far more than the&#xD;
daughter.  The happy heart -of the&#xD;
young does not continue bowed down&#xD;
by misfortune; thoughts of sorrow and&#xD;
regret, like birds of passage, never with&#xD;
them remain long, and their fancy in-&#xD;
vests the rudest scenes with the beauty&#xD;
reflected from their own sunny souls.&#xD;
Hester's busy hand soon garnished&#xD;
their little home. Within and without,&#xD;
the cottage bore evidence of her taste&#xD;
and her industry. Flower-pots lined the&#xD;
short walk from the garden-gate to the&#xD;
doorway;.the clematis wreathed around&#xD;
and hung its white bells over the lower&#xD;
windows ; there, too, the canary-bird,&#xD;
the only relic left to her of Brookland&#xD;
Hall, enjoyed the sun.&#xD;
When Mr. Somerset returned in the&#xD;
evening, after the publication of the&#xD;
paper, warm was the welcome he re-&#xD;
ceived. Hester's wild fervent kiss, and&#xD;
Isabella's quiet embrace, repaid him&#xD;
for allihis toil. They, at least, in word,&#xD;
act, or seeming, never caused him to&#xD;
regret the luxuries and the wealth he&#xD;
had forfeited. His mind, long tossed&#xD;
by anxieties, grew serene. Happiness&#xD;
had not yet for him-like the aerial]&#xD;
forms of the Greek poet, scared from&#xD;
earth by Guilt and Misery-winged&#xD;
her flight back to heaven. 'The divine&#xD;
presence of Love hallowed that humble&#xD;
home, and therefore Joy could not flee&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Two circumstances only raised at&#xD;
times uneasy sensations in the breast&#xD;
of Somerset. Hester informed him that,&#xD;
daring his absence at the offitte, she&#xD;
had frequently observed a man lurking&#xD;
around the house, and peering, with&#xD;
an extraordinary degree of curiosity,&#xD;
ever the garden rails. His object was&#xD;
&#xD;
evidently to watch the' movements of&#xD;
the inmates. She described him as a&#xD;
small, thin man, with scanty red Fhair.&#xD;
The same individual, she had learnt,&#xD;
had been making inquiries respecting&#xD;
them at some of the houses in the&#xD;
neighborhood. Hester once suddenly&#xD;
came upon him sitting behind the&#xD;
holly hedge, where he had been watch-&#xD;
ing, it seemed, for a considerable time.&#xD;
She asked him what he wanted, but he&#xD;
returned no answer, leaping actively&#xD;
up, and darting away.&#xD;
- Who was the man? and what was&#xD;
his purpose ? Neither Hester nor her&#xD;
mother had seen Pike, when he called&#xD;
at 'Brookland Hall in company with&#xD;
Mr. Abercrombie, and thus they were&#xD;
unable to identify the present intruder.&#xD;
Whether he were a-thief, a speculator&#xD;
with whom Mr. Somerset might have&#xD;
had former dealings, or an enemy having&#xD;
some secret design upon them, the fact&#xD;
of their being so watched caused them&#xD;
all, we repeat, not a little uneasiness.&#xD;
The other circumstance alluded to&#xD;
was connected with the loan of money&#xD;
made to Mr. Somerset by his brother.&#xD;
True, every debt, but this one, was&#xD;
liquidated, and Hartley, when the bill&#xD;
should fall due, might not, so Somerset&#xD;
thought, demand immediate payment.&#xD;
Still he owed the amount, and the&#xD;
merchant, on whom he :depended for&#xD;
just a similar sum, might fail him in&#xD;
the hour of need.&#xD;
Thus were they situated, contented&#xD;
in their altered circumstances, and&#xD;
happy, but for the -drawbacks above&#xD;
named. Hartley's visits at the cottage&#xD;
had been frequent of late, so that one&#xD;
morning, when he entered the house,&#xD;
his appearance excited no surprise.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset, as Hartleywell knew, was&#xD;
absent at the newspaper office ; Hester,&#xD;
also, chanced to be from home. Hart-&#xD;
ley, then, was shown by the servant&#xD;
girl into the parlor. - His business,&#xD;
he said, was rather important; but&#xD;
since the girl's master was absent, he&#xD;
would speak with her mistress. Mrs.&#xD;
Somerset, being informed of this, did&#xD;
hot hesitate a moment to see the visitor,&#xD;
and notwithstanding a little .reserve&#xD;
and embarrassment, she   addressed&#xD;
Hartley with that mildness and com-&#xD;
posure of manner peculiar to her ; she&#xD;
was friendly for her husband's sake,&#xD;
and endeavored to hide those feelings&#xD;
of mistrust and fear which secretly&#xD;
agitated her breast.&#xD;

&#xD;
mind-her own dishonor and her hus-&#xD;
band's impending fate. That Somerset&#xD;
would be in Hartley's power, she could&#xD;
not doubt for a moment. To avert his&#xD;
doom, then, must, she sink her-soul in&#xD;
infamy?   Virtue, womanhood forbade&#xD;
it. On the other hand,,too weak and&#xD;
timid affection pointed at the sacrifice.&#xD;
The villanous Hartley still whispered&#xD;
his unhallowed   tale, and  Isabella&#xD;
moved backwards, pale and affrighted.&#xD;
Then, as if her mind were overpowered,&#xD;
or she had taken a resolution, she&#xD;
sank upon her knees.&#xD;
"Roland ! Roland ! have pity 'upon&#xD;
me I" she cried, raising her clasped&#xD;
hands in supplicating agony. "How&#xD;
can you love me, and yet feel a pleasure&#xD;
in causing me torture? Were I to&#xD;
consent to your base proposal, were I&#xD;
even to fly with you, do you suppose I&#xD;
could ever be happy again?  Do you&#xD;
think Somerset would wish to avoid a&#xD;
prison by such a means? You know&#xD;
not his character, and you are ignorant&#xD;
of me, if you imagine this. Oh! awake&#xD;
to a sense of what is right, abandon&#xD;
your evil designs, think no more of a&#xD;
miserable being like myself, and I will&#xD;
forget all that has passed. Be merci-&#xD;
ful to Somerset, nor plunge him into&#xD;
deeper misery than the trials he has&#xD;
already known. I ask you not tocan-&#xD;
cel the debt, but consent to receive it by&#xD;
degrees. Listen to this appeal! pity&#xD;
my tears! No, no, you will not, Ro-&#xD;
land, doubly ruin your brother and&#xD;
break my heart !"&#xD;
As she ceased, Hartley observed a&#xD;
profound silence. He did not stoop to&#xD;
raise her from the floor, but regarded&#xD;
her with a freezing air. He crossed his&#xD;
arms on his breast, and his head gra-&#xD;
dually sank until' his eyes, beneath the&#xD;
projecting brow, were entirely unseen.&#xD;
Whatever passed in his mind, it was&#xD;
not divulged ; yet no softening of the&#xD;
features denoted that he felt the slight-&#xD;
est sympathy with the sorrows of Isa-&#xD;
bella. He stood there, as far removed&#xD;
from allthe warmer and gentler human&#xD;
feelings as an effigy of wax or a statue&#xD;
cast in iron. -&#xD;
"This is useless, madam. 'Be calm,&#xD;
Y beg of you. Your ravings affect me&#xD;
not. The time of chivalry and romance&#xD;
for me is. over. You refuse to accept&#xD;
my love., Be it so." A fierceness was&#xD;
now stealing into his abrupt manner,&#xD;
and the serpent was beginning to un-&#xD;
coil itself. "Nevertheless," he added,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am firm in this ; if I cannot have&#xD;
my love, I must have my-revenge 1"&#xD;
"Your -revenge !" - cried: Isabella,&#xD;
rising, and drawing herself proudly&#xD;
up. " Have you not seen us suffer sufil-&#xD;
ciently already ? Is not your revenge&#xD;
satisfied yet?"&#xD;
" No," said Hartley, between his&#xD;
teeth; "not yet. Why, Somerset, in&#xD;
spite of his losses, is getting contented&#xD;
again, serene, even happy ; while I-&#xD;
no-matter; this quiet life of his must&#xD;
be changed. But blame me not, ma-&#xD;
dam; rather thank yourself for the fate&#xD;
which awaits him."&#xD;
Hartley moved towards the door for&#xD;
the purpose of leaving the room.&#xD;
"Stay !" cried Isabella, still seeking&#xD;
to avert the calamity from her husband.&#xD;
"Will nothing move you?--no promise,&#xD;
no humiliation, no sacrifice ?"&#xD;
" You are acqTinted with the con-&#xD;
ditions."&#xD;
"Then Heaven help Somerset, and&#xD;
protect me !" The woman's pride was&#xD;
risingin her heart, and fear was giving&#xD;
place to the firmness of virtuous recti-&#xD;
tude. She slowly turned, and pointed&#xD;
at the~ door-" Go 1-leave this room&#xD;
-leave our humble cottage; you have&#xD;
yet to learn that some, though losing&#xD;
all of this world's wealth, are rich still&#xD;
in honesty and honor. Go, sir !-do&#xD;
your worst. Somerset and his family&#xD;
will not stain their reputation, come&#xD;
beggary- come imprisonment-come&#xD;
death !"&#xD;
Hartley, with a sullen air, strode&#xD;
away, breathing inwardly a curse upon&#xD;
the occupiers of that house, and resolv-&#xD;
ing never to relax in his efforts, but to&#xD;
go forward and "work out his vow."&#xD;
Isabella, now left aloe, found that&#xD;
high stern spirit, which had supported&#xD;
her in the hour of need, gradually for-&#xD;
sake her. The terrible fate which hung&#xD;
over her husband filled her with dis-&#xD;
may. Already fancy painted to her&#xD;
mind's eyethe horrors of a prison; she&#xD;
saw him there,' pining, wasting away,&#xD;
his energies crushed, and his proud&#xD;
spirit brought low.  With both her&#xD;
hands she covered her face, as iflto shut&#xD;
out the appalling picture; yet she shed&#xD;
no tears: there is an anguish which&#xD;
cannot sigh-which cannot weep.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LAW DOES ITS WORK.&#xD;
&#xD;
UNWILLING to inflict another pang&#xD;
on her husband, Isabella did not ac-&#xD;
quaint him with the insulting conduct&#xD;
of Hartley. She would rather for him&#xD;
to imagine that the unnatural brother&#xD;
was- swayed by mercenary motives,&#xD;
than the motives which in reality influ-&#xD;
enced him. That Hartley's determina-&#xD;
tion remained unaltered soon became&#xD;
evident: the bill had been placed in the&#xD;
hands of a banker, and on the day it fell&#xD;
due waspresented by a clerk in the&#xD;
usual manner. A notary-public, also,&#xD;
in the evening made his appearance at&#xD;
the cottage, demanding why-and where-&#xD;
fore the bill was refused payment, and&#xD;
duly " noting" the -same as dishonored.&#xD;
Somerset wrote to his brother, but&#xD;
received no answer. In a few days,&#xD;
however, the following letter reached&#xD;
him through'the post:-&#xD;
"Sin--I have had the honor to receive&#xD;
instructions from Mr. Hartley, of the&#xD;
Temple, to address you on the subject&#xD;
of a promissory note of yours, for five&#xD;
hundred and fifty pounds, of ,which he&#xD;
is the holder. He is surprised that the&#xD;
said promissory note, being due, and&#xD;
having been properly presented at your&#xD;
house, should remain in his hands un-&#xD;
paid.  I beg, therefore, to call your&#xD;
immediate attention to the subject;&#xD;
and if the said promissory note be not&#xD;
immediately taken up and covered,&#xD;
with the notarial. charges, the aforesaid&#xD;
bolder, Mr. Hartley, will be compelled&#xD;
promptly and instantly to adopt such&#xD;
measures as the law authorizes and&#xD;
directs.&#xD;
"Ihave the honor to be, your obe-&#xD;
dient servant,&#xD;
JEREMIAH PIIE.&#xD;
"Er6wn's Buildings, St. Mary-Axe."&#xD;
" Pike-Pike!" said Mr. Somerset,&#xD;
with blanched lips, as the letter fell&#xD;
from his hand-; "why this is the man&#xD;
who accompanied Abererombie, when&#xD;
that villain called on me at Brookland&#xD;
Hall.  Strange, at all events, that.&#xD;
Hartley should employ such a low&#xD;
rascal for his attorney."&#xD;
" Pike is the name," said Hester,&#xD;
" written on the back of the letter which&#xD;
I found in our garden, near the holly-&#xD;
hedge, where the strange man hadheen&#xD;
lurking."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Extraordinary !" observed Mr. So-&#xD;
merset  " What could Hartley's attor-&#xD;
ney want here? There must be some&#xD;
singular connection-between them."&#xD;
" Very likely, both being villains,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Somerset, in a tremulous&#xD;
voice, striving to hide the emotions&#xD;
which were overpowering her.&#xD;
Nothing transpired for a few days&#xD;
after the receipt of the attorney's let-&#xD;
ter. It might seem as though further&#xD;
proceedings were dropped. But the&#xD;
calm was deceitful; the stealthy work&#xD;
of the law was going forwards; an ac-&#xD;
tion had commenced, and the defend-&#xD;
ant not replying, judgment was ob-&#xD;
tained. " Then were sundry writs made&#xD;
out, and duly stamped - mysterious&#xD;
instruments of power not to be with-&#xD;
stood. The result of all was'that, one&#xD;
morning, a gentleman of a rather som-&#xD;
bre and sedate appearance knocked at&#xD;
the door of the cottage in Holloway-&#xD;
road ; he was admitted,,being followed&#xD;
by another person who walked close at&#xD;
his heels. Mrs. Somerset naturally .p-&#xD;
quired" whether he wanted her hus-&#xD;
band.&#xD;
" No, it's no matter, ma'am, though&#xD;
the gentleman is absent. -I don't want&#xD;
him-at least not yet ; I'm come to take&#xD;
the things."&#xD;
" The things ! What do you mean?"&#xD;
"Why, the furniture, to be sure."&#xD;
"No doubt the person has made&#xD;
a mistake," obsei-ved Hester.  "He&#xD;
should apply at the next house, where&#xD;
they are going to remove."&#xD;
The sombre-looking gentleman smil-&#xD;
ed ; the man at his heels laughed out-&#xD;
right.&#xD;
"It's no mistake, pretty miss. I'm&#xD;
-sorry, certainly, to be troublesome,&#xD;
ladies, but law is law, and it can't be&#xD;
helped. Look you, I'm a sheriff's offi-&#xD;
cer, and this is my man. I come here&#xD;
by the instructions of Mr. Pike, at&#xD;
the suit of Mr. Hartley, to put in an&#xD;
execution. -So remember, you won't re-&#xD;
move any of the goods. They'll be&#xD;
sold in due course by our auctioneer."&#xD;
Hester, who knew nothing of the&#xD;
law, was astonished. Mrs. Somerset&#xD;
stood, a' picture of silent dismay.&#xD;
The bailiff peeped into one room, and&#xD;
then into another ; after which l1e&#xD;
gravely shook his head.&#xD;
, " Bad-badI   I fear .there  ain't&#xD;
enough things in the house to satisfy&#xD;
one-quarter of the judgment. No doubt&#xD;
I-sliallh ave to serve another writ, for -&#xD;

the 'body,' by, and by. But let it be.&#xD;
Law is law. Ma'am, I shall leave my&#xD;
man here in possession ; you will give-&#xD;
him  meat and drinks recollect. Per-&#xD;
haps in two or three days our business&#xD;
will.be finished."&#xD;
Mr. Somerset,.if he wanted any other&#xD;
proof than the proofs already given&#xD;
was, now thoroughly convinced of the&#xD;
blackness of his brother's heart. His&#xD;
situation was the more trying. and bit-&#xD;
ter, inasmuch as he was beginning,&#xD;
-  by his perseverance and industry, to&#xD;
retrieve his circumstances.: The= little&#xD;
lac   furniture: in the cottage he ,had pur-&#xD;
chased ,out of his scanty savings, and&#xD;
all would now be taken from them.,&#xD;
He had imagined Hartley would have&#xD;
been the most lenient of his creditors,&#xD;
but,: on the contrary; he was likely&#xD;
to prove the hardest and-most inexora&#xD;
ble.-&#xD;
As the sheriff's officerforetold, the,&#xD;
auctioneer came, and everything in the.&#xD;
cottage was disposed of, including even&#xD;
the beds on. which the inmates lay.&#xD;
One thing only out oftthe wreck Hester,&#xD;
with many supplications and tears,.suc-&#xD;
ceeded in saving-that was her canary-&#xD;
bird.&#xD;
The unhappy family beheld them-&#xD;
selves in an empty house. Mr. Somer-&#xD;
set had a pound i his pocket. This&#xD;
enabled him to procure a small lodging.&#xD;
in the neighborhood; and, with two&#xD;
bundles (all the worldly goods they&#xD;
possessed), they sat down in their attic&#xD;
room, sorrowful-crushed, indeed, yet&#xD;
not in despair. So long as Somerset&#xD;
could follow his employment in the&#xD;
newspaper-office, they would not abso-&#xD;
lutely starve.&#xD;
In a short time the smile and the&#xD;
happy activity of Hester returned ;&#xD;
but the wild bursts of sorrow to which&#xD;
Mrs. Somerset had yielded were suc-&#xD;
ceeded by an unnatural stupor. Again,&#xD;
after the lapse of days, a flood of an-&#xD;
guish would break forth, and which&#xD;
tasked all Hester's soothing powers to&#xD;
check or mitigate ; yet her frame was&#xD;
not enfeebled, and -she betrayed no&#xD;
physical ailment. Meantime Mr:Pike&#xD;
was hunting for them, although for&#xD;
some time without success, and he&#xD;
blamed the sheriff's officer for losing&#xD;
sight of the "body." Like a blood-&#xD;
hound, he tracked them at last, for he&#xD;
discovered their attic; and then, smil-&#xD;
ing pleasantly and rubbing his meagre&#xD;
hands, he returned to the city.&#xD;
&#xD;
6V9&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are early-to-day," said a man&#xD;
to Mr. Somerset, as the latter was in&#xD;
the act of leaving his room, with the&#xD;
intention of proceeding to his place of&#xD;
business. It was the same person who'&#xD;
had levied the execution.on his furni-&#xD;
ture. " Ha I Isee you, know me. Well,&#xD;
it is as I- thought ; the goods. didn't&#xD;
fetch more than fifty pounds. The&#xD;
judgment ain't satisfiedas you may-sup-&#xD;
pose, so I've now-a writ to take the&#xD;
'body'"&#xD;
Although this last stroke did not&#xD;
come quite unexpected, Mr. Somerset&#xD;
for a moment lost his presence of mind.&#xD;
He drew backwards,-and-the movement&#xD;
brought him to the door of the room,&#xD;
where Mrs. Somerset and hester caught&#xD;
sight of him. In an)instant they were&#xD;
by his side, and.the appearance of their&#xD;
old enemy, the bailiff caused them the&#xD;
wildest alarm.&#xD;
"Now don't .be-frightened, ladies,"&#xD;
said the man; " there's no need ,of&#xD;
fear, no use in it, Itassure'e. Only'&#xD;
want 'the gentleman to'-come quietly&#xD;
along with me-; for law is.law."&#xD;
"With you?" cried Hester; ''and&#xD;
where ?"&#xD;
" Only to Mr. Stronglock's in Chan-&#xD;
cery-lane ; and afterwards, perhaps,- a&#xD;
little farther on, to the 'house.' "&#xD;
" What house ?" exclaimed   Mrs.&#xD;
Somerset.&#xD;
" Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.&#xD;
There's nice lodgings in that house,&#xD;
believe me ; that is, for those who can&#xD;
pay for 'em; for, you see,-the Fleet's&#xD;
rather expensive."&#xD;
Mrs. Somerset shrieked, and clung&#xD;
to her husband; Hester kissed him&#xD;
weeping bitterly, it is true, but whis-&#xD;
pering at the same time words of com-&#xD;
fort into his ear. The officer, long&#xD;
accustomed to such scenes, remained&#xD;
unmoved, feeling not the slightest touch&#xD;
of pity at witnessing the poignant dis-&#xD;
tress of that unhappy group.&#xD;
"Now, I say, good people, all this&#xD;
crying is of no manner of.use, depend&#xD;
on it. Law is law ; and, you see, we're&#xD;
bound to submit to it, or what would be&#xD;
the good of the fine institootions of this&#xD;
country, if we didn't, work 'em' out?&#xD;
Come along, mister; I've no time to&#xD;
spare."&#xD;
"But my situation, on which every-&#xD;
thing depends-if I am not at my post,&#xD;
I shall lose my situation."&#xD;
" Of course, that must go," said the&#xD;
officer, bluntly, "unless your gentle-&#xD;

men will bring your writing-work toi&#xD;

Mr. Somerset turned away his head.&#xD;
It was a spasm of unutterable anguish&#xD;
which came upon him ; but it passed,&#xD;
and for the sake of those whom he&#xD;
loved he strove to calm his agitated&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
"Be composed," he softly said to&#xD;
his wife and daughter. "We must&#xD;
bear this finishing-stroke to our des-&#xD;
tiny, or, rather let us say, we must be&#xD;
resigned to the will of Heaven. Good-&#xD;
by ; I will write to you from-"&#xD;
But they clung to him with an ago-&#xD;
nized, a wild tenacity it was piteous&#xD;
to behold., The matter-of-fact bailiff&#xD;
buttoned up his coat, being prepared&#xD;
to do his duty, and " work out," as he&#xD;
termed it, "the institootions of his&#xD;
country." He had some difficulty in&#xD;
untwining the arms that so closely em-&#xD;
braced his prisoner, whose person the&#xD;
bailiff now considered to be the pro-&#xD;
perty of the law.&#xD;
They would go with him ; they&#xD;
&#xD;
would be near him, and share his pri-&#xD;
vations and sufferings. But Mr. Somer-&#xD;
set could not accede to their prayer,&#xD;
and conducted them gently back into&#xD;
the room, repeating his assurances&#xD;
that he would shortly see them again.&#xD;
Thus he left them   to their bitter&#xD;
thoughts and tears, closing the door&#xD;
after him, and accompanying the officer'&#xD;
down the stairs.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset and the bailiff had just&#xD;
issued from the house; a hackney-&#xD;
coach was standing near, and on the&#xD;
other side of the road a man might&#xD;
.have been seen intently looking at it;&#xD;
he had remained for a long time&#xD;
motionless, but, on perceiving the officer&#xD;
and his prisoner, he moved a few steps&#xD;
nearer to the coach ; his hat was drawn&#xD;
over his brows ; there was a malicious&#xD;
sneer on his swarthy features, but the&#xD;
light of some triumphant and gratified&#xD;
feeling burned' in his eyes ; they were&#xD;
now fixed on Mr. Sognerset, who felt&#xD;
a thrill creep through him, for'the man&#xD;
who stood gazing on him so exultingly&#xD;
was Roland Hartley.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE RUINED GENTLEMAN IN THE FLEET&#xD;
PRISON.&#xD;
WELL has the Fleet Prison been de-&#xD;
nominated the "house of sighs :" well&#xD;
has the old structure, within the last&#xD;
few  years, been levelled with the&#xD;
ground., A  popular movement de-&#xD;
stroyed the Bastile in Paris; but here&#xD;
no national convulson, no blood-stained&#xD;
revolution, no uptearing of the founda--&#xD;
tions of society, were-required to-effect&#xD;
the demolition of the hoary pile. A&#xD;
quiet enactment of the legislature&#xD;
brought about the desired event ; and&#xD;
now the house of mourning, of cruelty,&#xD;
and extortion ranks only among the&#xD;
things which were.&#xD;
But our story is retrospective, em-&#xD;
bracing events- which occurred some&#xD;
twenty years ago. Then the Fleet&#xD;
Prison, though shorn of its ancient&#xD;
terrors, when a NeWton, a Bambridge,&#xD;
and a Huggins, memorable wardens,&#xD;
plied chain and starvation to wring the&#xD;
last farthing from the miserable debt-&#xD;
or; then, however, it saw quite suffi-&#xD;
cient suffering, and heard within its&#xD;
walls an amount of sighs large enough,&#xD;
to render it, at best, a very ominous,&#xD;
unenviable, and fearful place.&#xD;
We may remind the reader that the&#xD;
old prison, situated between Newgate&#xD;
and the thoroughfare now called Far-&#xD;
ringdon-street, was surrounded by a&#xD;
lofty brick wall, the outer portion of&#xD;
which remains, standing at the time&#xD;
we write. Access was had to the prison&#xD;
through an iron-bound door beneath a&#xD;
stone arch. After passing the porch,&#xD;
you perceived on the left hand a small&#xD;
room, and there sat the grim Cerberus,&#xD;
the keeper. Beyond the coffee-room,&#xD;
you reached the area, or yard, where&#xD;
the melancholy debtor contrived at&#xD;
times to kill weary time, and drown&#xD;
thought by plunging desperately into&#xD;
the exciting games of skittles and rack-&#xD;
ets.&#xD;
"Remember the ' poor debtor !"&#xD;
sounded in your ear. The pitiful ap-&#xD;
peal came from some prisoner placed&#xD;
&#xD;
for the time, as it was termed; "on&#xD;
the grate :" but whether the charita-&#xD;
ble pence dropped by the visitors into&#xD;
his box really went to relieve his own&#xD;
wants, or to fatten the warden and re-&#xD;
gale the tipstaffs, seemed to be a point&#xD;
never exactly ascertained.&#xD;
Burnt down by the great fire of Lon-&#xD;
don, 1666-rebuilt, burnt, and burnt&#xD;
again during the Gordon riots, and&#xD;
still, like a huge phoenix, rising from&#xD;
its ashes-the strange nondescript pile&#xD;
of buildings within the high encircling&#xD;
wall now spread before you. The at-&#xD;
tempt were hopeless to describe the&#xD;
place. Long passages, extending from&#xD;
one extremity -of the prison to the&#xD;
other, pierced with countless doors&#xD;
opening into single rooms: galleries&#xD;
above, and galleries below; large&#xD;
square apartments, in which debtors,&#xD;
unable to pay for private accommoda-&#xD;
tion, were lodged half-a-dozen together;&#xD;
damp rooms below the level of the&#xD;
yard; narrow, dark paths, sweeping&#xD;
around the entire buildings, and sepa-&#xD;
rating them from the great outer wall;&#xD;
a little town in itself, here exhibiting a&#xD;
heart-touching picture of misery, and&#xD;
there a scene of low, riotous mirth;&#xD;
bakers, with baskets of loaves on their&#xD;
backs for those who could purchase&#xD;
them; Jews, with- great black bags,&#xD;
driving bargains with gentlemen for&#xD;
their coats, the said gentlemen being&#xD;
content, until some kind friend from&#xD;
the outer world should transmit them&#xD;
new garments, to perambulate the lob-&#xD;
bies in their shirt-sleeves; the stout,&#xD;
facetious tipstaffs, with . red bottle-&#xD;
noses ; the lean man of letters, invoking&#xD;
inspiration with a sigh, and wetting&#xD;
his paper with his tears; the new-comer,&#xD;
staring 'around him in bewildered&#xD;
alarm: the initiated of thirty years&#xD;
pacing slowly along, and hanging his&#xD;
white head in pensive resignation to&#xD;
his fate ;-such was the scene which&#xD;
this ancient establishment, this cele-&#xD;
brated prison, presented.&#xD;
It was, early in the morning, and&#xD;
few of the inmates were yet stirring,&#xD;
being too happy to shorten the long&#xD;
bay by indulging in slumber. One&#xD;

&#xD;
man, however, was awake, and had&#xD;
risen. The room which he occupied&#xD;
belonged to those situated in the low-&#xD;
est part of the building. It was about&#xD;
four yards square ; the sides and roof&#xD;
were of stone ; the floor was of the&#xD;
same cold material, relieved only, by&#xD;
narrow.,slips of wood placed across-&#xD;
very welcome indeed to the solitary oc-&#xD;
cupants, especially in winter. A. low&#xD;
truckle-bed, with scanty clothes, but a,&#xD;
few sacks providentially kept in reserve,&#xD;
in case the sleeper should feel chilly ;&#xD;
two chairs, withoutthe convenience of&#xD;
backs; a single round, table, standing&#xD;
unsteadily on half-demolished claws ;&#xD;
a, deal box belonging to the inmate,&#xD;
containing his linen-these comprised&#xD;
the garniture of the room.&#xD;
He sat on the corner of his truckle-&#xD;
bed; his elbows rested on the table&#xD;
which he had drawn towards him, and&#xD;
his gray head reclined on his palms.&#xD;
The light which shone through the&#xD;
sinall-window above the door rendered-&#xD;
his features distinctly visible. No vio-&#xD;
lent paroxysm of sorrow now affected&#xD;
him ; his brow was slightly contracted,&#xD;
his eye was .fxed on the opposite wall,&#xD;
and his breathing was low and steady.&#xD;
The mind appeared to be wandering-&#xD;
can we assign limits to the ethereal&#xD;
spirit?-can we chain the rainbow&#xD;
wings of fancy?-it was wandering&#xD;
away from that miserable room, from,&#xD;
that house of, darkness. and sorrow,&#xD;
from the vortex of. busy, and to him&#xD;
fatal, London. Where was it-wander-&#xD;
ing ? In some imaginary land ?- some&#xD;
elysium of its own creating ?-no.&#xD;
Hugh Somerset was again in the old&#xD;
Elizabethan mansion  of Brookland&#xD;
Hall.  He sat in his study, his favor-&#xD;
ite volumes around him, with all the&#xD;
charms, the luxuries,, of an ancestral&#xD;
home. His eyes, directed-towards the&#xD;
large traceried window,roamed over&#xD;
the extensive park; the trees were&#xD;
rising there in picturesquegroups ; the&#xD;
deer were gambling on the knolls, and&#xD;
the stream, spanned by the rustic&#xD;
bridge, was bubbling along and sparJk-&#xD;
ling in the sun. His ear was attracted&#xD;
by a sound ; it was the silvery merry&#xD;
laugh of Hester, a child once more,&#xD;
chasing a butterfly on the terrace.&#xD;
Swiftly with her tiny feet she darted&#xD;
along the white shining pebbles, down&#xD;
the flight of polished steps, to the gar-&#xD;
den, and up again : around the large&#xD;
urns and vases; off to the fountain,&#xD;
&#xD;
cooling her arms in the liquid crystal;&#xD;
then flying, with the long golden hair&#xD;
like a stream behind her, towards the&#xD;
house : a thing of joyous impulses, to&#xD;
whom the mere sense of being seemed&#xD;
a rapture. So, flushed, breathless, but&#xD;
still all loveliness and laughter, she&#xD;
entered her father's study. She rushed&#xD;
up to his knee and hid her face on his&#xD;
arms, while Somerset stooped: down&#xD;
and showered kisses on the neck, the&#xD;
brow, the hair, of his loved and beauti-&#xD;
ful child.&#xD;
Ecstatic dream of hours never to re-&#xD;
turn! Kind fancy . which can thus&#xD;
restore to the bereaved heart scenes of&#xD;
such exquisite bliss Oh ! if, by some&#xD;
happy process of mental alchemy,&#xD;
these moments of golden imagination&#xD;
could endure through life, theseeming&#xD;
wretched would be wretched no more;&#xD;
but the silvery mist floats away ; the&#xD;
sun of reason must rise. A brawling&#xD;
in the outer court of the prison between&#xD;
some tipstaff and pugnacious debtor&#xD;
awakened Somerset to the reAity of&#xD;
the scene around him.. Slowly he turn-&#xD;
ed his gaze to the stone roof, the stone&#xD;
floor, and, the wretched-pallet. Brook-&#xD;
land Hall, the park, the trees,. the,&#xD;
young child, all the fairy scene ha4&#xD;
vanished, and he was alone--ruined&#xD;
-without hope. The once-envied, the&#xD;
wealthy and h appy man, was a prisoner .&#xD;
in a squalid jail. , Again his head&#xD;
dropped on his supporting palms, and&#xD;
his eyes were riveted on the- rough-&#xD;
table ; yet he uttered no complaint to&#xD;
himself; he did not sigh, but remained&#xD;
there silent and immovable as a sta.&#xD;
tue.          '&#xD;

HESTER VIsITs HER FATHER IN PRISON.&#xD;
PRIsoNERS unable to pay anything&#xD;
towards their lodging or support were&#xD;
placed in that part of the building&#xD;
called the "common side." There they&#xD;
were quartered in large rooms, capable&#xD;
of holding several beds, and they ate&#xD;
their scanty fare at a common table.&#xD;
Anxious to avoid such a mode of living&#xD;
altogether repugnant to his feelings,&#xD;
Mr. Somerset preferred a room apart&#xD;
in the lower story, even though it&#xD;
might be damp and cold. For this the&#xD;
terms were one shilling and three&#xD;

But the daughter was now to act the&#xD;
part of the good housewife; her bonnet&#xD;
was thrown off, her fair hands were&#xD;
ungloved, and she was busily searching&#xD;
in the corner of a small basket which&#xD;
she had carried on her arm. The roll&#xD;
appeared at last, and the butter, the egg,&#xD;
and the coffee ; and Hester kept prat-&#xD;
tling all the while of a thousand ide-&#xD;
scribable things-trifles to which the&#xD;
sweet tongue of woman only can give&#xD;
interest and significancy. Then she&#xD;
invited her father to partake of the pre-&#xD;

man did eat, and talked to her, and at&#xD;

beseeches Heaven to grant her strength,&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER IN SEARCH oF A sITUATION.&#xD;
THE - original sum owed by Mr. So-&#xD;
merset to Roland Hartley was- 5501.&#xD;
The sale of the furniture in the Hol-&#xD;
loway cottage had reduced the amount&#xD;
to 5001. This debt, then, did Hester&#xD;
purpose, by her single unaided efforts,&#xD;
to liquidate.&#xD;
How   should she commence ?   By&#xD;
means of what occupation might she&#xD;
hope to: save money gradually and&#xD;
surely, after . providing for her own&#xD;
wants, and allowing her father a small&#xD;
weekly sum?    This question for a&#xD;
considerable time had: occupied her&#xD;
mind, and puzzled her brain. Any&#xD;
situation to which a certain annual&#xD;
stipend might be attached, such as&#xD;
that of a teacher in a school, or a go-&#xD;
verness in a family, would not answer&#xD;
the purpose. No hope could possibly&#xD;
exist of effecting the freedom of her&#xD;
father, if she could gather together no&#xD;
more than the limited sum of 151. or&#xD;
201. a year. The pursuittnecessary for&#xD;
her to adopt must be one from which an&#xD;
increasing remuneration may be ex-&#xD;
pected, and it must be one whereby&#xD;
extra exertions shall beattended with&#xD;
extra gain.&#xD;
The eyes of Hester had been dazzled&#xD;
by the splendid shops of milliners and&#xD;
dressmakers in the west end of. the&#xD;
metropolis. Were it possible, thought&#xD;
the girl in her far-stretching hope-&#xD;
were it possible for her to rise gradual-&#xD;
ly to be mistress of one of such esta-&#xD;
blishments, her aim would be accom-&#xD;
plished; her father would be free, and&#xD;
she should be able to support him and&#xD;
her afflicted mother in comparative&#xD;
affluence.&#xD;
These golden dreams were filling her&#xD;
head, when one morning she set forth.&#xD;
from Fleet-lane towards the aristocratic&#xD;
regions of the west, Eagerness gave&#xD;
her wings as she passed up Holborn ;&#xD;
her, heart -began to throb when she,&#xD;
entered Great Russell-street; more and&#xD;
more these palpitations increased, as&#xD;
she proceeded along Oxford-street: her&#xD;
step grew slow, and her limbs trembled,&#xD;
as she approached nearer to the place&#xD;
where she designed making her first&#xD;
application. Hester was a novice yet&#xD;
in the business of the world,,and she&#xD;
had not, alone and unsupported, come&#xD;
into collision with the merciless and&#xD;
scornful.&#xD;

HESTER SOMERS"ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Her agitation, caused by uncertainty&#xD;
and suspense, did not subside, and she&#xD;
stopped before a print-shop for a few&#xD;
moments, to collect her thoughts, her&#xD;
eyes being fixed, notion the pictures,&#xD;
but the card that bore the number of&#xD;
the'house in Regent-street to which&#xD;
she was proceeding. Who cared for&#xD;
her ? The throng passed up and passed&#xD;
down ; what to them was the little&#xD;
world within her bosom? What cared&#xD;
those reckless passers-by for the fears,&#xD;
.the anxieties,.the sorrows, which wrung&#xD;
her heart? Yes, she was in solitude&#xD;
amidst that vast busy. crowd. None&#xD;
asked her whom she sought, or what&#xD;
she wanted. Sc there did Hester&#xD;
stand, leaning on the window-sill, look-&#xD;
ing on her card, her cheek pale and&#xD;
her hand trembling. At length she&#xD;
felt a slight tap on her shoulder; it&#xD;
awoke her to her recollection, and she&#xD;
looked up at the -person who touched&#xD;
her. It was one of the newly-organ-&#xD;
ized police, who, about this period, be-&#xD;
gan to perambulate the streets of Lon-&#xD;
don. "You must move on," said the&#xD;
man ; "you mustn't block up the pave-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
The idea of such a fragile creature&#xD;
as-Hester blockingg up the pavement"&#xD;
was novel and preposterous enough ;&#xD;
but the functionary said so, and his&#xD;
word was sufficient. Casting a piteous&#xD;
look at the man, whose face was&#xD;
"made" stern for the occasion, the girl&#xD;
obeyed. The. incident, however, was&#xD;
not without its good effect, for it roused&#xD;
her spirit, and by, urging her into&#xD;
action, enabled her, in part, to conquer&#xD;
her agitation.&#xD;
Reaching the Circus, she turned&#xD;
down Regent-street. It was now by a&#xD;
desperate effort that Hester strung her&#xD;
nerves, and resolved to go through her&#xD;
intended task. The magnificent shops,&#xD;
with their huge panes of plate-glass,&#xD;
and 'gorgeous display of fashionable&#xD;
trifles, blazed around her. Carriages&#xD;
were drawn up in front of the doors,&#xD;
and tall footmen, with their gilt staves,&#xD;
were standing, grave as Oriental eu-&#xD;
nuchs, on the edge of the pavement.&#xD;
Hester reached the house which she&#xD;
sought. It had a private entrance and&#xD;
no shop-front, resembling in this re-&#xD;
spect many other great fashionable es-&#xD;
tablishments of its kind in London.&#xD;
Several splendid equipages, in waiting&#xD;
outside, denoted the place to be one of&#xD;
no small consequence. Ringing the&#xD;
&#xD;
bell (the daughter of the ruined 'squire&#xD;
was no longer a lady, so she dared not&#xD;
knock), Hester was questioned by the&#xD;
porter in livery as to her business.&#xD;
"I wish to see the mistress of the&#xD;
house."&#xD;
The man, with the scrutiny peculiar&#xD;
to his class, eyed her from  head to&#xD;
foot. Her clothes were plain, but not&#xD;
vulgar. . Her beautiful figure was now&#xD;
erect, and her veil, half removed, dis-&#xD;
played her striking countenance. The&#xD;
worthy janitor of the house saw nothing&#xD;
objectionable in her appearance, and&#xD;
thei'efore condescended to be civil.&#xD;
" You want madame ?-good. Do&#xD;
you bring an order, miss ? Excuse me&#xD;
for asking ; as we don't permit every&#xD;
one to enter madame's room."&#xD;
" No ; I am recommended to apply&#xD;
here for employment."&#xD;
The man's manner changed, and he'&#xD;
was immediately coarsely familiar.&#xD;
"So, so, my prettygirl, that's it, is&#xD;
it? Well, you did right to ring, and&#xD;
not knock. The girls who oon{f a-&#xD;
knocking after situations, we, that's&#xD;
me, always turn away. I don't allow&#xD;
'workers to knock at my door. But&#xD;
come inside, my near, and don'tblush.&#xD;
I never take liberties--that's against&#xD;
the rules."&#xD;
"Let me see Madame Mongolier !"&#xD;
said Hester, in an impatient and rather&#xD;
indignant tone.&#xD;
"Can't !" exclaimed the man. "Ap-&#xD;
plicants for situations never see ma-&#xD;
dame, or she might be pestered all day.&#xD;
But follow me; you may speak to the-&#xD;
forewoman."&#xD;
Hester walked   after the  porter&#xD;
through a long passage. Several doors&#xD;
opened on either hand, revealing with-&#xD;
in splendid assortments of all kinds&#xD;
of dresses, and indescribable nicknacks&#xD;
intended for the adornment of the fe-&#xD;
male person. Ladies also were there,&#xD;
choosing, admiring, purchasing, and&#xD;
envying; while the music of soft sweet.&#xD;
tongues was    floating  everywhere.&#xD;
Meantime Hester was hurried forward,&#xD;
and at the end of the passage her guide&#xD;
mounted a few steps, and, turning&#xD;
shortly to the left, reached a door which&#xD;
opened into a very spacious room.&#xD;
Here was discovered a multitude of&#xD;
heads, all bending down in the same&#xD;

&#xD;
starch-faced woman who happened just&#xD;
then to be near.&#xD;
"Mademoiselle, this young person&#xD;
wishes to speak with you."  Having&#xD;
thus delivered himself, he hurried&#xD;
back to his post at the front door.&#xD;
The forewoman, Mademoiselle Har-&#xD;
fleur, was a genuine Parisian, about&#xD;
thirty-five years of age, small in her&#xD;
person, but strong and active. She was&#xD;
sharp in her countenance, and sharp&#xD;
in her intellect. Her skin was dry and&#xD;
sallow, but a little rouge skilfully laid&#xD;
on gave an unchanging freshness and&#xD;
piquancy to the face. She had superb&#xD;
and ravishing curls, subject only to a&#xD;
slight drawback-they were all false !&#xD;
The pearly teeth, said to have beautified&#xD;
Una, Beatrice, the  Floras, and the&#xD;
Sylvas, were brown in comparison&#xD;
with the stain   masticators of Ma-&#xD;
demoiselle  arfleur. Oh! divine den-&#xD;

Nature, defeated, bends to thee, and&#xD;
confesses thy superiority, surpassing&#xD;
Parisian dentist!I&#xD;
Madenmoiselle was busily employed&#xD;
giving directions to one of the work-&#xD;
women, so that several minutes elapsed&#xD;
before she took any notice of Hester.&#xD;
Having finished her story, she turned&#xD;
quickly around, and spoke in a rapid&#xD;
manner, with a strong French accent.&#xD;
"Ha! the porter, I think, said some-&#xD;
thing about you. Well, what do you&#xD;
want, my girl? Speak !"&#xD;
Hester answered in French, suppos-&#xD;
ing her knowledge of that language&#xD;
might be considered advantageous, and&#xD;
win her the good graces of the fore-&#xD;
woman.&#xD;
"HaI ha !" laughed Mademoiselle&#xD;
Harfleur, holding her sides ; "you are&#xD;
no Parisian, I perceive. No foreigner&#xD;
was ever yet perfect in our immortal&#xD;
language.  You are English; -speak&#xD;
your own tongue, child."&#xD;
"Forgive me; I did not presume to&#xD;
pass for French. I am recommended&#xD;
to Madame l\iongolier; I am in want&#xD;
of employment."&#xD;
"Oh !well, very well !" cried the&#xD;
little woman, turning every moment,&#xD;
and darting here and there her restless&#xD;
eyes. "We need a few extra hands&#xD;
just now. What can you do? Whose&#xD;
employ have you been in ?"&#xD;
emI have as yet been in no person's&#xD;
employ. I have taken a few' lessons."&#xD;
"Where i7"&#xD;
&#xD;
79&#xD;
&#xD;
" In the suburbs of London-at Hol-&#xD;
loway."&#xD;
" Ha! bad, very bad !"  And Made-&#xD;
Inoiselle Harfieur shrugged her shoul-&#xD;
ders, and shook her -luxuriant false&#xD;
curls.&#xD;
"I do not expect high remuneration,"&#xD;
said Hester.&#xD;
"Of course not. Your employment&#xD;
must be that of a seam-runner."&#xD;
"Most willingly, madam."&#xD;
"You can aspire to nothing higher.&#xD;
Well, we want some good seam-run-&#xD;
ners, being rather busy. What is your&#xD;
name ?"&#xD;
As Hester answered, the little wizen-&#xD;
faced lady took a small book from her&#xD;
pocket, and, producing a pencil, was&#xD;
prepared to write.&#xD;
" You will pardon my questions, but&#xD;
we always make inquiries respecting&#xD;
those we employ.    Where do you&#xD;
live ?"&#xD;
"In Fleet-lane."&#xD;
"Where is that? Stay, I think I&#xD;
know ; it is a dirty place somewhere in&#xD;
the city. Well, what is your father ?"&#xD;
He was a country gentleman."&#xD;
Was ?-then perhaps he is dead."&#xD;
"No, thank God, he is still alive."&#xD;
"Then, what is he?"&#xD;
Hester knew not how to answer the&#xD;
question: at length she said-" No-&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"h6 Oh ! he is 'nothing ;' that is very&#xD;
bad again. He won't support his fami-&#xD;
ly, I suppose? Where is he now ?"&#xD;
This was terrible interrogatory.&#xD;
It took Hester by surprise, and she&#xD;
found it impossible to return a reply.&#xD;
The paleness which overspread her&#xD;
face, and the agitation which suddenly&#xD;
oppressed her, raised a singular suspi-&#xD;
cion in the mind of the Frenchwoman.&#xD;
"Excuse me, my girl, but it is ne-&#xD;
cessary these little particulars should&#xD;
be known before we engage young wo-&#xD;
men, for we are select, very select.&#xD;
Where, Irepeat, is your father now ?"&#xD;
" Spare me !" gasped Hester; "ask&#xD;
me any question but that."&#xD;
"  a, foi! ma cthre, this is strange 1"&#xD;
"I beseech you, have compassion on&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
In her eagerness, clasping her hands,&#xD;
she had moved up close to, Mademoi-&#xD;
selle Harfleur.  The curiosity of the&#xD;
latter was awakened, not her pity, and&#xD;
she drew the girl a little apart from the&#xD;
workwomen. Hester spoke in a low&#xD;
voice, and did not conceal the truth.&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
This was sufficiently evident from the&#xD;
strong pantomimic action of the foreign&#xD;
lady, for Mademoiselle Harfieur elevat-&#xD;
ed her eyes until little more than the&#xD;
whites were seen ; then raised, her&#xD;
hands--gestures intended effectively to&#xD;
express the greatness of her surprise&#xD;
and horror.&#xD;
"A prison ?" whispered mademoi-&#xD;
selle,; "how dreadful!  But I spare&#xD;
your feelings, I will be silent. Your&#xD;
father in a prison ?-that's surpassingly&#xD;
dreadful, young woman. What a de-&#xD;
praved character he must be ! Never&#xD;
mind-you need not explain-say no&#xD;
more about the matter, I pray you; my&#xD;
nerves are shocked-quite upset. Of&#xD;
course I pity you, but I don't think,&#xD;
under these unhappy and most dis-&#xD;
agreeable circumstances, that you are&#xD;
suited to our establishment."&#xD;
The trembling of Hester increased,&#xD;
and bitter disappointment was added&#xD;
to the, sorrow she already felt.&#xD;
"Give me a trial! I will be diligent;&#xD;
I will do all in my power to give you&#xD;
satisfaction.  You know the person&#xD;
from whom I bring my testimonials."&#xD;
"Why, yes; Madame .Mongolier&#xD;
knows her slightly," said the fore-&#xD;
woman, with a freezing accent. " She&#xD;
does recommend you for honesty,&#xD;
diligence, and so on, which is all very&#xD;
well." The little woman meditated for&#xD;
an instant, placing her forefinger on&#xD;
her tawny brow. "Well, let me see ;&#xD;
Madame Mongolier leaves the business&#xD;
of engaging assistants entirely to my-&#xD;
self. We, are in want of hands, I re-&#xD;
peat.. You shall have a trial. . You&#xD;
may come."&#xD;
" And when may my duties com-&#xD;
mence ?" asked Hester, with delighted&#xD;
and palpitating heart. -&#xD;
"Lose no time-we are busy-come&#xD;
to-morrow."&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
NEsTER'S FIRST STRUGGLE IN THE GREAT&#xD;
METROPOLIS.&#xD;
THE hours during which Hester&#xD;
worked in the large establishment of&#xD;
Madame Mongolier were from nine in&#xD;
the morning until nine at night. She&#xD;
was allowed two meals, and the remu-&#xD;
neration she received exceeded that&#xD;
usually given by other houses to young&#xD;
women in, her capacity. It was 9s. a&#xD;
&#xD;
week. From this amount Hester pur-&#xD;
posed to expend, during the same length&#xD;
of time, 3s. on herself, 3s. on her father,&#xD;
as an addition to his prison allowance,&#xD;
and the remainder was to be put by for&#xD;
the grand object she had in view. The&#xD;
last sum would, indeed, be a small&#xD;
niite towards raising the 5001.  But&#xD;
Hester did not stop here ; she intended,&#xD;
after the. cessation of her labors in&#xD;
Regent-street, to work half the night&#xD;
at her lodgings in Fleet-lane, and all&#xD;
thus gained would be clear profit, to be&#xD;
appropriated entirely to what may be&#xD;
termed her "general fund." -- The&#xD;
weekly accumulation might further re-&#xD;
ceive a small increase, in the shape of&#xD;
interest, by being placed in a savings-&#xD;
bank.   These monetary schemes and&#xD;
devices, although strange at first, soon&#xD;
became familiar to the child of neces-&#xD;
sity, thrown on her own resources ; and&#xD;
poor Hester became a financier, a,&#xD;
Necker, a Pitt, in her small way ; a '&#xD;
hoarder, a miser-but, oh, for what a&#xD;
purpose !     -&#xD;
It was three o'clock in the afternoon,&#xD;
and Hester was seated among her sister&#xD;
laborers in the great depot of fashion&#xD;
in Regent-street. Carriages were drawn&#xD;
up before the door as on previous occa-&#xD;
sions;, loud knocks were heard, and&#xD;
the footman in waiting was hurrying&#xD;
to and fro. Fashionable ladies crowded&#xD;
the show-rooms, where the august Ma-&#xD;
dame Mongolier herself did the honors.&#xD;
The room, we have already observed,&#xD;
which contained the " workers," the&#xD;
fabricators of the gay things for those&#xD;
who themselves "toil not nor spin,"&#xD;
was very spacious, but little care had&#xD;
been bestowed with regard to its venti-&#xD;
lation. This latter circumstance,' we&#xD;
need not remark, was calculated seri-&#xD;
ously to affect the health of the inmates.&#xD;
There was a mass of heads confused&#xD;
and mixed, and bowed down like pop-&#xD;
pies when charged with rain. Hair of&#xD;
all colors, from the light auburn to the&#xD;
jetty black; complexions of most shades&#xD;
saving those of the tropics; figures an-&#xD;
swering to our ideas of deformity and&#xD;
our notions of elegance ; beauty :of&#xD;
many descriptions-these were blended&#xD;
together in that room of toil, and af-&#xD;
forded a striking picture.&#xD;
The little Frenchwoman, with her&#xD;
rouged cheeks and false curls, reigned&#xD;
the queen of the place; and as a voice&#xD;
was heard, or a half-laugh broke forth&#xD;
from some younger creature not yet&#xD;

Such were a few of Hester's compan-&#xD;
ions, whose positions and appearance&#xD;
we have endeavored briefly to sketch.&#xD;
We need scarcely say that, among all&#xD;
the group, no one was found more&#xD;
anxious to give satisfaction, or more&#xD;
diligent than she. . Blessed with glow-&#xD;
ing health and a strong constitution,&#xD;

affected  by  the  confinement.  She&#xD;
labored in Regent-street twelve hours&#xD;
during the day; but, when she return-&#xD;
ed to Fleet-lane, it was not to retire to&#xD;
her bed.- No; if she sought the luxury&#xD;
of rest at the ordinary time, small pro-1&#xD;
gress would be made in accumulating&#xD;
the nzoney. Every hour given to toil,&#xD;
she considered an hour taken awayE&#xD;
from the term of. her father's cap- t&#xD;
tivity.  -_I&#xD;
Hester was skilful at netting purses,'&#xD;
and designed by this means to aug-c&#xD;
ment her earnings. Seated at her t&#xD;
small table, the blind ofRher window c&#xD;
drawn down, there might she have&#xD;
been seen laboriig while .the surround- t&#xD;
ing neighbors were asleep.- Her rush- b&#xD;
light afforded a dull and varying light,n&#xD;
yet it was sufficient to enable the busy t&#xD;
fingers to ply the red and green silk p&#xD;
threads. St. Paul's clock struck hour&#xD;
after hour, for, scarcely heeded by day, e&#xD;
during the profound stillness of the F&#xD;
night those loud, far-pealing, tremen- s&#xD;
dous tones drown the chime of all other .&#xD;
clocks in the vicinity, and sound like n&#xD;
the solemn voice of incarnate Time o&#xD;
announcing the gradual approach of his fc&#xD;
last foe-Eternity!                  h&#xD;
Deep into the night, far on towards b&#xD;
morning, toiled the prisoner's indefati- n&#xD;
gable daughter. It was some consola- w&#xD;
tion to reflect that, while divided, she g&#xD;
was still near her father ; a few houses T&#xD;
off-a few steps, and there stood the l&#xD;
walls of the gloomy prison. She would o&#xD;
think-but while she thought, would&#xD;
not suspend her netting-she would d&#xD;
think, was he then asleep? or did his w&#xD;
perturbed spirit meditate and mourn? a&#xD;
Was he using on Brookland Hall, on&#xD;
his ruined fortunes, on the fate of her m&#xD;
mother, or was he thinking of her ?- F&#xD;
&#xD;
A tear-a low sigh-a gradual closing&#xD;
of the eyes, as fatigued nature was&#xD;
nearly worn out-a sudden waking up&#xD;
and renewal of her task-L--another hour&#xD;
tolled on the deep solemn bell-again a&#xD;
dropping of the languid hands, and&#xD;
the falling forward of the fair head;-&#xD;
so passed the time, until the natural&#xD;
weakness and weariness of humanity&#xD;
could be resisted no longer, and Hes-&#xD;
ter would creep to her pallet, and--&#xD;
slumber.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE HUNOBACK MUSICIAN.&#xD;
SEVERAL other lodgers, both male&#xD;
and female,.were domiciled under the&#xD;
same roof with Hester. Two of these&#xD;
lodgers we shal now introduce to the&#xD;
reader.&#xD;
The persons alluded to were an only&#xD;
son and his mother, who rented a sit-&#xD;
ting-room and closet immediately be-&#xD;
.ow the garret occupied by Hester.&#xD;
The apartments, if they may be so&#xD;
called, were miserable in appearance,&#xD;
the furniture being half broken, or&#xD;
clumsily patched and mended. Thus&#xD;
a table, shattered in the centre, served&#xD;
he office of two; a worm-eaten form,&#xD;
having met with a similar fate, gar-&#xD;
nished both sides of-the hearth. Carpet&#xD;
here was none, its place being sup-&#xD;
plied by a thin layer of yellow sand..&#xD;
Jester's apartment was    cheerless&#xD;
nough, but the dwelling-place of Mark&#xD;
Flemming and his mother was far more&#xD;
0.&#xD;
At the fragment of' table the young&#xD;
man was now seated. He was probably&#xD;
older than his appearance indicated,&#xD;
or his complexion was very fair, and&#xD;
is person diminutive. -A large music-&#xD;

veloped intellect, assuring him that&#xD;
mind like his would eventually triumph&#xD;
over difficulties, and bear him on to th&#xD;
honors and the fame which he coveted&#xD;
Flemming had for some time filled ao&#xD;
situation in.the orchestra of a minor&#xD;
theatre. This precarious source of in&#xD;
come was all he-possessed, and barely&#xD;
put bread into the mouths of his parent&#xD;
and himself. His musical talents had&#xD;
never been appreciated. The fine notes&#xD;
of his violin, and the highflights of his&#xD;
tasteful, exuberant fancy, were lost at&#xD;
the low City Theatre, where the musi-&#xD;
cians, only intent on striking the vul-&#xD;
gar ear, blew their trumpets, shrieked&#xD;
on their clarionets,and beattheir drums,&#xD;
imagining that the loudest music was&#xD;
of necessity the best. Who would be-&#xD;
lieve genius could exist in Fleet-lane ?&#xD;
or the soul of an Orpheus be enshrined&#xD;
in a hunchback seated on a broken&#xD;
stool, amidst squalor and wretched-&#xD;
ness ?&#xD;
Flemming's instrument was silent,&#xD;
his fervor had abated, and his features&#xD;
settled into their accustomed stillness,&#xD;
expressive of thought and melancholy.&#xD;
He remained for several minutes with-&#xD;
out moving or speaking: and so ab-&#xD;
stracted was he, that he did not feel&#xD;
the light passing of fingers over his&#xD;
face. His mother, stationed Behind his&#xD;
stool, was bending over him, and those&#xD;
fingers moved across the cheeks under&#xD;
the eyes, but chiefly over the forehead.&#xD;
This was the only method the blind&#xD;
woman possessed of discovering the&#xD;
sorrowful or happy feelings which, at&#xD;
different times, might affect her son, and&#xD;
it rarely deceived her. She did not&#xD;
find the traces of tears on his cheek,&#xD;
and she felt no contracting of the lips&#xD;
indicating harsh or bitter feelings; but&#xD;
the brow was gathered in a manner&#xD;
which plainly assured her that he was&#xD;
not simply studying music, or reading.&#xD;
"Now, what ails thee, my boy? You&#xD;
played that piece exquisitely, and it will&#xD;
be sure to attract attention."&#xD;
&#xD;
m    Flemming did not speak,&#xD;
d    " I know you ought to perform solos&#xD;
d in order to be judged fairly by the au-&#xD;
, dience ; but you say they will not per-&#xD;
e mit this at the theatre."&#xD;
o   Still the hunchback made no obser-&#xD;
d vation. The blind woman found his&#xD;
, hand, which had been buried beneath.&#xD;
h his waistcoat.&#xD;
h    " My boy, what means this agitation?&#xD;
You are in a fever !1&#xD;
a   "Not of the body, but of the mind,"&#xD;
said Flemming, at length.&#xD;
e   " A fever of the mind," repeated the&#xD;
. mother, in an anxious tone ; " then this&#xD;
comes of your deep study."I&#xD;
"It does not arise from that-no,&#xD;
- no !" The meagre arm rested on the&#xD;
table, the pale forehead was leant upon&#xD;
t the hand, and the thoughtful eyes were&#xD;
I fixed on-the mother's face. That look&#xD;
of intense sadness turned instinctively&#xD;
to her-instinctively, for a moment's re-&#xD;
flection would have told him that is&#xD;
- sorrows so expressed could not be made&#xD;
known to one who was blind. Much'&#xD;
of the same feeling came over the heart&#xD;
of the great conqueror,* when, his&#xD;
armies at length defeated, and his em-&#xD;
pire lost, he turned, in the anguish of&#xD;
his spirit, though she who had given&#xD;
 him birth was not there to hear him,&#xD;
and exclaimed-"My mother! my&#xD;
mother 1"&#xD;
"Here are two nosegays," said the&#xD;
woman, feeling about the table ; " why&#xD;
have you divided the flowers which&#xD;
you got for me this morning into two&#xD;
nosegays? I would rather have had&#xD;
them in one bunch."&#xD;
. "One is for you, and one for her,"&#xD;
said Fle-mming., And his pale cheek&#xD;
glowed, and his lip quivered.&#xD;
"One for ier ? Who is that ?"&#xD;
" For the young lady up stairs."&#xD;
The blind woman started, but her&#xD;
surprise soon gave place to anxiety and&#xD;
distress.&#xD;
" That young lady, Mark;' she said,&#xD;
hesitatingly, some sudden and strange-&#xD;
suspicion having awaked in her mind--&#xD;
"that young lady, though she is so&#xD;
poor, though she labors sohard night&#xD;
and day, is the daughter of a fallen&#xD;
gentleman-she would not accept your&#xD;
nosegay."&#xD;
"I do not mean to offerit to her ; I&#xD;
only place flowers or ,e ,mantle-shelf&#xD;
during her absence "&#xD;
- *&#xD;
Nar&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Have you done this often before,&#xD;
then, silly boy ?"&#xD;
No answer was returned ; therefore&#xD;
the mother presumed her son had been&#xD;
guilty of the folly.&#xD;
" Surely," said the woman, in a&#xD;
hurried and anxious tone, "you are not&#xD;
in love with Miss Hestr Somerset ?"&#xD;
"In love with her ?" said Flemming,&#xD;
rising from his stools and walking to&#xD;
and fro in the small apartment ; "it&#xD;
is not love, mother, which I feel, for the&#xD;
sentiment I entertain for you is love ;&#xD;
but it is a hopeless bitter dream, a long-&#xD;
ing after that which can never be ob-&#xD;
tained, a frenzy, a consuming fire-a&#xD;
passion which has no name !"&#xD;
The -hunchback stopped before the&#xD;
window, and slightly raised the sash&#xD;
to let in the air, for he gasped for&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
" Mark, you have strong sense, and&#xD;
an aspiring intellect; 'subdue these&#xD;
idle feelings, which can only bring&#xD;
with them disappointment, and embit-&#xD;
ter-your life.''&#xD;
It cannot be.  I have struggled&#xD;
long and much, but the torrent cannot&#xD;
be stemmed ; I am borne away in the&#xD;
whirlpool of my mad passion. Do not&#xD;
reason with me; do not endeavor to&#xD;
show me my folly,.for I am conscious of&#xD;
it already-wretched abortion! mise-&#xD;
rable deformed monster that I am !"&#xD;
"Hush ! hush!"&#xD;
"Men regard -me only as an object&#xD;
of ridicule; women turn from me with&#xD;
'     horror."&#xD;
"Pity  me, Mark ! For :my sake,&#xD;
hush !" cried the mother, clasping her&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
''Why fell upon me this heavy curse?&#xD;
Oh! why, why did I come into the&#xD;
world ?"&#xD;
His .hands were pressed upon his&#xD;
forehead ; his white cheeks, quivering&#xD;
lips, and straining eyes all evinced the&#xD;
agony of his working and perturbed&#xD;
spirit; but these passionate gestures&#xD;
from the poor mother were kindly con-&#xD;
cealed ; she could only hear his words&#xD;
yet they were sufficient to overwhm&#xD;
her with distress. She strove to sp ak,&#xD;
but utterance failed her.; yet no tears&#xD;
filled her eyes. That woman had not&#xD;
wept for years, for, with her sight,&#xD;
seemed also to have departed the capa-&#xD;
bility of shedding those drops which&#xD;
relieve the heart.&#xD;
Her arms were now thrown around&#xD;
the neck of her wayward son-the boy&#xD;
&#xD;
85&#xD;
&#xD;
all beauty to her fancy, all perfection&#xD;
to her partial judgment. She was able&#xD;
to speak at length, and prayed him not&#xD;
so to upbraid Heaven, not so to curse&#xD;
his own -destiny. Then she strained&#xD;
him to her breast, kissed his forehead,&#xD;
his neck, his hands, his hair, in all the&#xD;
wild abandonment and blind devotion&#xD;
of the mother for her offspring. Wo-&#xD;
man ! woman! in joy and in wretch-&#xD;
edness, in youth and in age, who&#xD;
among God's creatures can love like&#xD;
thee?&#xD;
Flemming relented, his heart soften-&#xD;
ed, and every sentiment of bitterness&#xD;
vanished. He returned his mother's&#xD;
fond endearments, beseeching her to&#xD;
forgive him. The wilder and harsher&#xD;
passions, indeed, subsided, yet, in spite&#xD;
of the seeming calm to which he was&#xD;
restored, an undercurrent of strong&#xD;
feeling ran beneath the tranquillized&#xD;
surface ; the eruption was over, but&#xD;
the lava still boiled'in the dark depth&#xD;
of the volcano. The love of the poor&#xD;
deformed for the child of grace and&#xD;
light, hopeless though it might be, con-&#xD;
tinued the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TWO VILLAINS.&#xD;
"WHAT    news ?-what have    you&#xD;
learnt?" asked Hartley of Mr. Pike,&#xD;
as the latter gentleman entered, the&#xD;
Templar's chambers. ,With his usual&#xD;
quiet sneaking air when in the presence&#xD;
of his superiors, Pike shut the door&#xD;
after him, placed his hat upon the&#xD;
ground, and with his red silk hand-&#xD;
kerchief began to wipe the perspiration&#xD;
from his forehead. This action, simple&#xD;
as it might be, was performed so slowly&#xD;
and quietly, that it spoke better than&#xD;
words a happy confidence on Mr. Pike's&#xD;
part, while at the same time he seemed&#xD;
to say-" I don't mind.~fatigue; I am&#xD;
most willing to labor, even to the&#xD;
sweat of my brow, in the service of my&#xD;
patron." The lawyer then seated him-&#xD;
self, and significantly smiled.&#xD;
"Pretty good success, Mr. Hartley,&#xD;
pretty good ; I have discovered the&#xD;
place where she lives, and her employ-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"Very well," said Hartley, nodding&#xD;
his head; "and where does she re-&#xD;
side ?"&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not far from her father-in Fleet-&#xD;
lane."&#xD;
"And her occupation?"&#xD;
"To support herself, and supply Mr.&#xD;
Somerset with a few little comforts in&#xD;
the prison-for prison-fare, you must&#xD;
know, is not far removed from starva-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
" Comforts ? supply Somerset with&#xD;
comforts ?" and Hartley suppressed an&#xD;
oath.&#xD;
" She has obtained a situation in a&#xD;
certain establishment in the west end&#xD;
of London; they pay her, I learn,&#xD;
rather handsome wages."&#xD;
"This will not do !" exclaimed IHart-j&#xD;
ley ; " my object will be defeated--the&#xD;
keeping of Somerset upon bread and&#xD;
water ; for. through him," he added,&#xD;
speaking in an absent manner, as if to&#xD;
himself, "I have lost this woman for-&#xD;
ever. . Have not her anxiety, her love'&#xD;
for him-ay, for him I destroyed even&#xD;
her intellect?  Go on, Mr. Pike."&#xD;
"1I have to tell you a little in addi&#xD;
tion to this. Not contented with labor-&#xD;
ing through the day, she sits up half&#xD;
the night manufacturing purses, for&#xD;
which she obtains a good remunerating&#xD;
price at the shops."&#xD;
"Worse and worse! What can the&#xD;
miserable child be aiming at?"&#xD;
Now it was Mr. Pike's interest to&#xD;
throw as many difficulties and dangers&#xD;
around the subject as possible, where-,&#xD;
by he might awaken Hartley's alarm,&#xD;
and impress upon his patron's mind&#xD;
how veryvaluable were his (Mr. Pik4's)&#xD;
services.&#xD;
"What is she aiming at, ask you,&#xD;
Mr. Hartley? Ha! I have learnt that&#xD;
as well 1" exclaimed the little -man,&#xD;
knowingly shaking his head. " You&#xD;
will smile, perhaps, when I name the&#xD;
fanciful, and apparently preposterous&#xD;
design which this young girl has con-&#xD;
ceived. A blindowoman in the house,&#xD;
whose acquaintance I have nIade,- in-&#xD;
formed me of it, for Miss Hester, in a&#xD;
moment of childlike fervor, hinted as&#xD;
much to her. What think you of the&#xD;
possibility of her saving from her shil-&#xD;
lings a week a sufficient sum to liqui-&#xD;
date her father's debt, and so release&#xD;
him from prison? This, I assure yoti,&#xD;
is the daughter's grand object, the end&#xD;
for which she so unceasingly toils."&#xD;
Allthe bitterness of Hartley's nature&#xD;
was awakened by these words. The&#xD;
mere idea of his victim thus, at length,.&#xD;
escaping from his hands incensed him&#xD;
&#xD;
to a degree which kindly and forgiving&#xD;
spirits might, indeed, marvel at. His&#xD;
hatred had a onenesswhich gradually&#xD;
absorbed into itself all other passions;&#xD;
and his vengeance, like some ravenous&#xD;
vulture, though it constantly devoured,&#xD;
was never satisfied. The foul bird of&#xD;
the soul remained there hanging over&#xD;
the prey, nor would it depart while&#xD;
one remnant was left for a future&#xD;
feast.&#xD;
"The debt," said Hartley, "for&#xD;
which I detained Somerset in prison is&#xD;
now 5001. I have taken measures to&#xD;
influence distant relatives, for near&#xD;
ones we have none ; therefore I have&#xD;
no apprehension that the sum will be&#xD;
advanced him. -wBut, Mr. Pike, do you&#xD;
indeed imagine it ® possible that the&#xD;
wretched child can save up the mo-&#xD;
ney by following the occupations you&#xD;
name?"&#xD;
" Can't say," answered the wily; attor-&#xD;
ney. "Your question is a difficult one&#xD;
to answer, Mr. Hartley. We have read&#xD;
and heard of very wonderful things per-&#xD;
formed by children for their parents,&#xD;
especially, I may add, sir, by daugh-&#xD;
ters."&#xD;
He coughed, and looked obliquely&#xD;
from out of the corners of his twin-&#xD;
kling black eyes.&#xD;
"'We -must put a stop to this," said&#xD;
Hartley, in a decided tone.&#xD;
"How? what power may the law&#xD;
give us to' restrain the actions of this&#xD;
young woman ?"&#xD;
" Never mind the law; I tell you we&#xD;
must stop .this; even if the daughter&#xD;
should not eventually succeed. in her&#xD;
aim, the very hope of such a consum-&#xD;
mation will buoy up the father in pri-&#xD;
son. A man who has hope burning in&#xD;
his breast, though it'tells falsehoods,&#xD;
will never sink, never be crushed."&#xD;
"He will not. I echo your senti-&#xD;
ments," said Mr. Pike.&#xD;
" Then listen. - You seem at a loss to&#xD;
understand how we shall frustrate this&#xD;
Hester Somerset's designs,; the thing&#xD;
may be done in the simplest manner.&#xD;
Cause her to be dismissed from the&#xD;
situation she now fills."&#xD;
" Ha ! truly; that will be striking at&#xD;
the root-cutting off her chief. re-&#xD;
source."&#xD;
" Let your task then be the effecting&#xD;
of this object."&#xD;
The little man pondered, leaning his&#xD;
bristly chin on his bony hand. Good&#xD;
and virtuous thoughts were passing&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
through his mind; at least he himsel&#xD;
thought so. In a few minutes he spok&#xD;
in a subdt ed tone, his eyes fixed on th&#xD;
ground:-,&#xD;
" So, I must devise a plan to csus&#xD;
and obtain Miss Somerset's discharge&#xD;
I must be the instrument used in de&#xD;
feating a virtuous child's pious design&#xD;
Is this line of conduct consistent wit]&#xD;
the principles of honor, justice, an&#xD;
humanity, which, -I am proud to say,&#xD;
have always advocated? Tell me, Mr&#xD;
Hartley, is it?"&#xD;
The   Templar impatiently kicke(&#xD;
away a stool near him, and-" pshaw'd!'&#xD;
only - adding, "remember your annu&#xD;
Mr. Pike turned himself uneasily it&#xD;
his chair. "Well, let me see. ThI&#xD;
young lady works so extremely hard&#xD;
at present, and must do so, if unmter&#xD;
rupted, for a series of years, that ten&#xD;
chances to one but her labor will de&#xD;
stroy her health ; ay, bring on consump-&#xD;
tion; and consumption in this country&#xD;
is certain death. What then? the&#xD;
question is whether a man shall remain&#xD;
in prison, where he may muse on philo&#xD;
sophical subjects, and read books all his&#xD;
ife, or whether a human-being shall&#xD;
die-prematurely, I say, die, drop into&#xD;
her grave in her young .and virgin&#xD;
bloom. Alas l I perceive I must not&#xD;
hesitate ; I must suspend the labors of&#xD;
the child and so save her life, while the&#xD;
father must remain in jail.  This is&#xD;
humanity -this is justice! this is the&#xD;
part of a Christian!1-Mr. Hartley, I&#xD;
will most readily do what you desire."&#xD;
".Thank you; see that she be dis-&#xD;
missed from the place, and cast upon&#xD;
the stream, within a week."&#xD;
"You may depend upon me. Yes,&#xD;
yes," added Mr. Pike to himself, as he&#xD;
walked down the, stairs, " I will save&#xD;
this innocent female from a prema-&#xD;
ture grave; it's only my duty."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. PIKE'S FIRST MANCEUYRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was a subject of deep regret to&#xD;
Hester that she was not able to spend&#xD;
daily a longer time with her father ;l&#xD;
the prison doors, for the admission of&#xD;
strangers, did not open before eight in&#xD;
the morning, and were closed at sunset.&#xD;
&#xD;
f Her occupation in Regent-street confin-&#xD;
e ed her from nine to nine ; consequently&#xD;
e the only time allowed her was in the&#xD;
morning, from eightuntil half-past, the&#xD;
e remaining half hour being occupied by&#xD;
. her walk to the scene of her labors,&#xD;
- We have been thus particular, because&#xD;
. on the above apparently trifling cir-&#xD;
h cumstance hangs an event of no small&#xD;
d importance. Mr. Pike, from whose&#xD;
I keen scrutiny little could be hid, when&#xD;
. once he.resolved fairly to search into&#xD;
matters, soon made himself acquainted&#xD;
d with Hester's position. He also learnt&#xD;
" the rules of the establishment to which&#xD;
she belonged. One rule in particular, as&#xD;
expressly calculated to favor his design,&#xD;
he kept in view ; namely, a workwoman&#xD;
who was late at her post in the morn-&#xD;
e ing, and repeated the offence, was sum-&#xD;
d marily dismissed.&#xD;
" I think this will do," said the little&#xD;
gentleman to himself, as he turned his&#xD;
- plans round and round in the sour&#xD;
- churn of his mind. "I'll proceed that&#xD;
way ; it is as good, and perhaps as easy&#xD;
as any other ; it won't either cause the&#xD;
poor creature much pain or mortifica-'&#xD;
- tion, which pis a great poipt gained,&#xD;
humanity considered ; yes, I'll never&#xD;
l inflict pain on a fellow-creature; that&#xD;
is, unless some high moral purpose is&#xD;
to be served."&#xD;
Thus soliloquized the casuist of St.&#xD;
Mary-Axe, as passing down Ludgate-&#xD;
hill he turned into Fleet-market. Anx-&#xD;
ious to serve Hartley, and to lose no&#xD;
time, he- was come to watch the mo-&#xD;
tions of his unsuspecting victim. Mr.&#xD;
Pike walked to and fro, at a distance&#xD;
from the .prison; his hands - in his.&#xD;
pockets, and his head hanging down.&#xD;
Every now and then his eyes glanced&#xD;
toward the prison doors, where he ex-.&#xD;
peeted the girl would present herself&#xD;
for admittance, the hour of eight draw-&#xD;
ing near. No doubt she would come;&#xD;
Hester never missed coming, in rain, or&#xD;
cold, or storm-he well knew that.&#xD;
Even when weak and indisposed, still&#xD;
she was there, patiently stationed at&#xD;
the gate, until the regulations allowed&#xD;
the porter to open it. Oh 1 yes, Pike&#xD;
knew the strength of a daughter's love,&#xD;
and built upon7it.&#xD;
" I see her 1" he . muttered, a smile&#xD;
puckering up the corners of his long&#xD;
thin mouth, which seemed to have no&#xD;
lips ; and then he turned into an alley&#xD;
on the opposite side of the street to&#xD;
conceal himself.  Meantime Hester&#xD;
&#xD;
;"--&#xD;

&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
had'approached the gate, and after the&#xD;
lapse of a few minutes it was opened.&#xD;
They met-7*the father and child, with&#xD;
the usual welcomes, the usual inquir-&#xD;
ies, and the usual fervent embrace.&#xD;
Such a repetition of endearments might&#xD;
tire an observer, but themselves it could&#xD;
never tire. Hester endeavored to im-&#xD;
press upon her father the excellence of&#xD;
her situation, but concealed from'him&#xD;
the knowledge of the fatigue which she&#xD;
underwent. She said pleasant things&#xD;
to cheer his heart--pleasant things,&#xD;
with smiles of hope, and bursts of de-&#xD;
light, still pointing-to the day when he&#xD;
should be-free.&#xD;
Limited, indeed, was the time, as we&#xD;
l7ave observed, allowed to these inter-&#xD;
views. The minutes hurried on as if&#xD;
each had a wing. The hands on the&#xD;
dial of the prison-clock seemed to pos-&#xD;
sess a cruelty in them-they moved so&#xD;
fast.&#xD;
But the half hour was spent, and she&#xD;
must not peril her situation, for her&#xD;
duties demanded her presence in Re-&#xD;
gent-street at nine. Again the embrace&#xD;
of affection, a little trembling . of the&#xD;
limbs, a choking of the voice, but no&#xD;
tears, these the daughter always spared&#xD;
the father, and then she hurried away.&#xD;
Hester had proceeded about half the&#xD;
distance to the place of her destination,&#xD;
when she saw a man with a quick step&#xD;
cross from the other side of the street;&#xD;
he faced around, appearing to have&#xD;
missed his way, and then, meeting her,&#xD;
suddenly stopped. He slightly raised&#xD;
his large hat, for he recognized Hes-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
" How fortunate I" said Mr. Pike;&#xD;
"my dear young lady, how fortunate !"&#xD;
Hester stared at being thus accosted.&#xD;
" I have wished to.see you above all&#xD;
things, but knew not where to find you.&#xD;
My name is Pike-Mr. Pike, the soli-&#xD;
citor."-&#xD;
I recollect," said Hester, recover-&#xD;
ing from her surprise; "you are Mr.&#xD;
Hartley's attorney."&#xD;
"Exactly; employed at his suit&#xD;
against your father, poor Mr. Somerset&#xD;
-unfortunate, but:noble-hearted Mr.&#xD;
Somerset. I regret the business sin-&#xD;
cerely: I bleed for him ; I lament-,his&#xD;
fate, and-I sympathize with-,you, my&#xD;
dear young lady; , but it cannot be&#xD;
helped.-s 1 have acted throughout a&#xD;
reluctant part; believe me, quite :con-&#xD;
trary to my feelings.  Alas ! .alas !&#xD;
such are the unpleasant and sad tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
which we men of the law are oftentimes&#xD;
compelled to perform!1"&#xD;
Hester's interest was awakened, and&#xD;
there was so -much plausibility in Mr.&#xD;
Pike's words, and- so much apparent&#xD;
genuine feeling in his manner, that her&#xD;
candid heart did not suspect him, She&#xD;
perceived not ther-fiend in the little,&#xD;
smiling, insignificant man before her;&#xD;
she detected not the serpent beneath&#xD;
the flowers.&#xD;
" Sir, I am much obliged, and very&#xD;
grateful for your kind remarks. What&#xD;
business may you have with me? I am&#xD;
rather pressed for time."&#xD;
They had, for a few minutes, been&#xD;
standing still on the pavement.&#xD;
" Business? ha-yes," said Pike ;&#xD;
" rather important business, Miss So-&#xD;
merset; it concerns the fate of your&#xD;
poor father. We must arrange matters;&#xD;
we must get him out of prison."&#xD;
Hester uttered an exclamatio 1, her&#xD;
eyes sparkling with pleasure.&#xD;
" Can this be, sir ?" she cried. "Oh !&#xD;
there is too much rapture in the thought&#xD;
of such an event to believe it possible."&#xD;
" Certainly, it is possible. Why, you&#xD;
are laboring, are you not, for his re-&#xD;
lease? excellent, dutiful young lady&#xD;
that you are.".&#xD;
Mr. Pike looked at her with his&#xD;
quick penetrating eyes, and the beams&#xD;
they shot seemed to enter into her&#xD;
brain, for she was fascinated, spell-&#xD;
bound, and could not withdraw her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
Your business, sir?" she murmur-&#xD;
ed. "Will you not kindly talk to me&#xD;
as we walk along? I must-forgive&#xD;
me-I must be at Regent-street by nine&#xD;
o'clock."&#xD;
Pike took out his watch, looked at&#xD;
it, and quietly returned it to his fob.&#xD;
" Nine o'clock-certainly--nothing&#xD;
like punctuality. I have something&#xD;
most important to communicate to you,&#xD;
but it is rather unfortunate that I have&#xD;
a pressing engagement myself in the&#xD;
city at the same hour, and I cannot&#xD;
get off. Suppose, for once, you are a&#xD;
little after your time ; tell your em-&#xD;
ployer that. business which respected&#xD;
your father detained you, and I am cer-&#xD;
tain she will not find fault. Come,&#xD;
walk my way."&#xD;
Hester was at a loss how to acts and&#xD;
her look expressed extreme uneasi-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"I'll tell you all as we proceed down&#xD;
Holborn. ULpon my word, I can't stop&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
another minute, my engagement in the&#xD;
city is so urgent. What! your father's&#xD;
welfare, his very release dependent on&#xD;
my communication, and still you hesi-&#xD;
tate ? I did not expect this of you,&#xD;
young lady.&#xD;
The last appeal was sufficient, and&#xD;
it decided Hester. She would break&#xD;
through, for once, the rules of the es-&#xD;
tablishment, and so turned back with&#xD;
the lawyer.&#xD;
And what was the subject of Pike's&#xD;
"important communication ?"  What&#xD;
light or hope did he throw on the dark-&#xD;
ness of Mr. Somerset's lot? True, he&#xD;
talked very fast, and he talked a great&#xD;
deal. He spoke of bills, judgments,&#xD;
detainers; of sheriff's powers, and&#xD;
warden' rapacious propensities ; of&#xD;
plaintiffs and defendants: in a word,&#xD;
he succeeded in interesting, but, at the&#xD;
same time, quite puzzled and perplexed&#xD;
the mind of Hester. She listened and&#xD;
strove hard to understand him, but it&#xD;
passed her capacity to do so. The&#xD;
words "release from prison" were&#xD;
often repeated, but how that release&#xD;
was to be effected, Pike, by some&#xD;
means or other, did not, or could not&#xD;
explain.&#xD;
When they reached the Old Bailey,&#xD;
the attorney said he had finished, and&#xD;
wished Hester a good morning. All&#xD;
the way was now to be traced back; but,&#xD;
this she cheerfully did, and proceeded,&#xD;
lost in thought, endeavoring by recall-&#xD;
ing the words of the lawyer, to compre-&#xD;
hend their meaning.&#xD;
As soon as Mr. Pike had passed&#xD;
around the corner, he chuckled to&#xD;
himself, and again drew forth his&#xD;
watch.&#xD;
"'Tis nine o'clock; she will be half&#xD;
an hour after her time., This is a very&#xD;
good beginning. Yes, I'll get her dis-&#xD;
charged within the week."  And then&#xD;
the little man, quoting some beautiful&#xD;
moral passage in support of his con-&#xD;
duct, shot off to his office in St. Mary-&#xD;
Axe.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. PIKE IS INDEFATIGABLE-A SCENE AT&#xD;
MADAME MONGOLIE E'S. .&#xD;
THE following morning saw Hester&#xD;
Somerset on her accustomed way to the&#xD;
place where she obtained her livelihood.&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
Having passed through Holborn, and&#xD;
entered Oxford-street, she had proceed-&#xD;
ed more than two-thirds of the distance,&#xD;
when a man might have been observed&#xD;
following her with hasty steps.  He&#xD;
speedily gained her side, and touched&#xD;
her arm. Mr. Pike appeared com-&#xD;
pletely out of breath through the rapid-&#xD;
ity of his walking, so that, whether&#xD;
his exhaustion were feigned or not, he&#xD;
spoke with difficulty.&#xD;
"Miss Somerset ! Miss Hester Somer-&#xD;
set 1"&#xD;
The, girl instantly recognized Mr.&#xD;
Pike.&#xD;
"I just entered the prison this&#xD;
morning to see your father on business.&#xD;
It must have been a few minutes only&#xD;
after you left."&#xD;
"Well, sir ?" cried Hester, startled&#xD;
by the speaker's manner, for he was in&#xD;
great excitement.&#xD;
" He was taken suddenly--"&#xD;
"Ha 1 what do you mean ?"&#xD;
" Suddenly ill-ill, young lady-des-&#xD;
perately ill, and he begged me to hurry&#xD;
after you-to overtake you, if.possible.&#xD;
Thank Heaven !" he added, wiping his&#xD;
forehead, "I have succeeded."&#xD;
The alarm, the terrible dismay of&#xD;
Hester, may be imagined, and for an&#xD;
instant she stood rooted to the spot.&#xD;
That was not a moment to weigh well&#xD;
men's words and sift their motives ;&#xD;
that was not a moment calmly to pen-&#xD;
etrate the veil of the hypocrite, .or&#xD;
elude his snares. Judgment was in-&#xD;
capable of exercising her powers ; fear,&#xD;
apprehension, and anguish only swayed&#xD;
her mind.&#xD;
"Ill -very ill ?" at length she, ex-&#xD;
claimed. "Will you-call a coach ?"&#xD;
"Now, can't you walk back to the&#xD;
prison, dear young lady? I'll support&#xD;
you," sail Mr. Pike, in his blandest&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"I cannot walk ; I can scarcely stand.&#xD;
This intelligence is so sudden, so over-&#xD;
whelming."&#xD;
Pike perceived her situation ; so, a&#xD;
hackney-coach-passing at the time, he&#xD;
lifted. his finger, which sign quickly&#xD;
brought the vehicle to the pavement.&#xD;
He assisted her in, but, before he fol-&#xD;
lowed, took the opportunity of Whisper-&#xD;
ing into the ear -of the coachman,&#xD;
"Drive slowly to the Fleet; the young&#xD;
lady is an invalid, and cannot bear&#xD;
quick driving."&#xD;
Hester thought an unusual time had&#xD;
elapsed; and still they did not arrive at&#xD;
&#xD;

the prison.  She expressed. her sur-k&#xD;
prise, but Mr. Pike told her there was&#xD;
a stoppage of carriages in the street,.&#xD;
which circumstance annoyed him ex-I&#xD;
ceedingly. Now he leant out of the&#xD;
window, and order ed the driver to&#xD;
proceed another way, of course a&#xD;
further one, for he (Mr. Pike) was cer-&#xD;
tain the street before them was being&#xD;
paved, and consequently the thorough-&#xD;
fare blocked up. The driver, although&#xD;
he knew the gentleman was mistaken,&#xD;
conceiving he had some private reason&#xD;
for prolonging the journey, implicitly&#xD;
obeyed the directions given him. Thus,&#xD;
before the coach drew up in front of&#xD;
the prison, a very considerable as well&#xD;
as unnecessary time had passed.&#xD;
" Here we are," said Pike. -"Now,&#xD;
get out, Miss Somerset."&#xD;
" My fare!" demanded the driver,&#xD;
addressing the gentleman.,F&#xD;
" No," said the attorney, buttoning&#xD;
up his coat; " that young lady will&#xD;
settle with you. 'Tis her business.",&#xD;
The girl, in her anxiety to join her&#xD;
father, rushed towards the gate. The&#xD;
driver followed her.&#xD;
" Stop, if you please, miss ; the gen-&#xD;
tleman says you are to pay."&#xD;
" Pay!" cried Hester, wildly. " Oh!&#xD;
do not detain me. Where is Mr.&#xD;
Pike ?"&#xD;
That individual was moving off.&#xD;
"I can be of no use to your father,&#xD;
young lady. I dare say the--the doc-&#xD;
tor is with him now; besides, I've urg-&#xD;
ent business."&#xD;
"My money !" demanded the coach-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"I would pay the fare," said Pike,&#xD;
"though it isn't my concern, but un-&#xD;
fortunately I left my purse at home-&#xD;
good-morning."&#xD;
"Now, then, miss, if you please !"&#xD;
repeated' the man, in a rather angry&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"What is it ?" cried Hester, hur&#xD;
riedly.&#xD;
"Eighteen-pence; for I must have&#xD;
something extra, taking you so far&#xD;
around."-&#xD;
"Taking us so far around? We&#xD;
were most anxious to get here."&#xD;
The man only smiled, still holding&#xD;
out his horny hand for the demanded&#xD;
fare. Hester said not anotheraword&#xD;
ut ill as she could afford it, paid the&#xD;
m ney, amounting to-one day's wages&#xD;
an hurried into the prison. Great&#xD;
was the surprise of Mr. Somerset ai&#xD;
&#xD;
seeing his daughter return in such an&#xD;
alarmed and excited state.KAs the&#xD;
reader will be led to anticipate, the d&#xD;
gentleman was perfectly well,    or&#xD;
had he seen anything that day of Mr.&#xD;
Pike.&#xD;
Hester was thunderstruck, casting&#xD;
around her a bewildered look,sand Mr.&#xD;
Somerset was totally at a loss to con-&#xD;
ceive what motive the attorney could&#xD;
have in fabricating such a falsehood.&#xD;
haWe knowhe is a villain, Hester--a&#xD;
crafty, designing scoundrel-the tool of&#xD;
my cruel and unnatural brother Hart-&#xD;
ley. Yet cheer thee, child; you will&#xD;
not be imposed on a third time."&#xD;
"No," said - Hester, confidently.&#xD;
"But we will talk more of this when&#xD;
we next meet. I must leave you; for&#xD;
look, father, at the clock ! I shall be to-&#xD;
day at Regent-street one hour after my&#xD;
time."&#xD;
Hester saw nothing more of her&#xD;
enemy, Mr. Pike, for a few days - but,,&#xD;
on the-Saturday morning of the same,&#xD;
week, just as shehad entered Oxford-&#xD;
street, where it joins High-street, St.&#xD;
Giles's, she caught a glimpse of his&#xD;
thin brown visage. There were several&#xD;
people standing about ; for St. Giles's&#xD;
was ever famous for its numerous idlers,&#xD;
drunkards, and thieves. Hester could&#xD;
not pass without entering among some&#xD;
of these people, but she hurried for-&#xD;
ward with trembling step and averted&#xD;
head. Presently Mr. Pike might have,&#xD;
been seen edging towards her. He&#xD;
walked by apparently with an: absent&#xD;
air, but, at the same time, brushed-&#xD;
rudely against her. Then he stopped,&#xD;
thrust his hands into his pockets, and,&#xD;
searching them hurriedly, the next in-&#xD;
stant raised an outcry.&#xD;
"I am robbed !    I have lost my.&#xD;
purse !"                    .   --&#xD;
The men gathered around him, for&#xD;
the least outcry in the streets of Lon-&#xD;
don speedily collectsa mob. The cir-&#xD;
cle of curious idlers enclosed Hester&#xD;
and Pike, so that the former was&#xD;
unable to escape, and all were mixed&#xD;
together.&#xD;
" Who has robbed you ?" asked, one&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"How much have you lost, sir ?"&#xD;
I demanded another.&#xD;
,  " I hope you don't accuse me 1" said&#xD;
e a third, fourth, and fifth, whose shrewd,&#xD;

you," cried Mr. Pike, gazing around.&#xD;
"I am sure it was a female who thrust&#xD;
her hand into my pocket; but she has&#xD;
escaped; better, perhaps, that it should&#xD;
be so, poor unhappy creature I I'm not&#xD;
one, gentlemen, who loves to prosecute&#xD;
women. Let her go."&#xD;
"But she 'ain't gone," exclaimed a&#xD;
man, who rudely laid his hand on Hes-&#xD;
ter's arm. "I saw this young lass&#xD;
only a minute ago close by the gentle-&#xD;
man, and as he passed she seemed to&#xD;
spring away from him."&#xD;
" True," observed Pike. "That is&#xD;
the female. Well, since she has not es-&#xD;
caped, hold her fast--'tis our duty to&#xD;
do so. Poor chatureI" added Pike,&#xD;
shaking his head, his heart melting, it&#xD;
appeared, with compassion.   " How&#xD;
young she is, too ! A sad thing tQ turn&#xD;
thief so early in life ; but, perhaps, she&#xD;
is starving."&#xD;
Hester, as much in astonishment as&#xD;
in alarm, gazed from face to face; she&#xD;
seemed paralyzed, being unable to&#xD;
speak; and there, like a condemned&#xD;
victim, powerless, submissive, she stood&#xD;
trembling in the ruffian grasp of the&#xD;
man who had seized her.&#xD;
"Do you understand, young woman,&#xD;
the charge against you?" asked the&#xD;
fellow.&#xD;
"No," answered Hester, at length.&#xD;
" What is the meaning of all this ?"&#xD;
A, horselaugh broke   from  those&#xD;
around her ; they thought her crafty,&#xD;
and therefore they laughed. That&#xD;
mirth to her ear was horrible, and she&#xD;
shrank away and coveted her face ;&#xD;
but Mr. Pike now came forward with&#xD;
a police-constable, who quietly told&#xD;
Hester that she was accused of robbery.&#xD;
Then did she comprehend her situation;&#xD;
her face turned deadly white, and a&#xD;
shriek sprang to her lips.&#xD;
"You had better, I think," said&#xD;
fr. Pike to the constable, "take her&#xD;
to the station-house at once."&#xD;
"I robbed a person!     Oh! you&#xD;
mistake-you mistake ! Hear me-I&#xD;
am innocent. - I would perish sooner&#xD;
than be guilty of such an act."&#xD;
" That's what all you girls say," ob-&#xD;
served -the constable, calmly. " It&#xD;
won't do, however. Now just come&#xD;
along, young woman; it's of no use&#xD;
struggling." -&#xD;
" But search me I" urged Hester, in&#xD;
her agony. " See if I have the purse&#xD;
in my possession."&#xD;
"9We'll do that," said the police&#xD;
&#xD;
., "                                   Jeh _ru                                                                   , 'NVt. h .:f" AFik'tb'PnT.h    4nM4°R                                     °_??; W* ,&#xD;
&#xD;
functionary, drawing  her forward,&#xD;
"by and by at the station-house."&#xD;
"Poor thing !" murmured Pike, fol-&#xD;
lowing them. " I won't prosecute-&#xD;
I can't do it--she is so young. We&#xD;
ought to pity her, gentlemen; however,&#xD;
the laws must be obeyed."&#xD;
Owing to the pressure of the crowd,&#xD;
some time elapsed before they reached&#xD;
the spot. Moreover, Hester had fainted,&#xD;
and the constable was obliged to carry&#xD;
her. When they entered the station-&#xD;
house, the doors were closed against&#xD;
the mob. The usual process of reviving&#xD;
those who faint was resorted to, and&#xD;
Hester at length opened her eyes and&#xD;
recovered her senses. The necessary&#xD;
questions were asked by the inspector&#xD;
of police, and the search was made ; no&#xD;
money could be- found upon the girl's&#xD;
person except one shilling, which her&#xD;
own poor purse contained. Mr. Pike&#xD;
and his witness looked confounded ;&#xD;
the former was peculiarly restless, now&#xD;
looking into his blue bag, and now&#xD;
busily hunting again through his&#xD;
pockets.&#xD;
"Well," said the ins ctor,'"we&#xD;
can't find the purse, it is true ; but&#xD;
this, I am sorry to say, doesn't prove&#xD;
the young woman innocent. 'Tis an&#xD;
easy thing to-.drop money when the&#xD;
theft is found out."&#xD;
" Or," added the witness, " to slip&#xD;
it into the hands of an accomplice."&#xD;
"Hold your tongue !" said the in-&#xD;
spector, jealous of his prerogative to&#xD;
offer suggestions. " It isn't your place,&#xD;
my man, to fancy this, or fancy that ;&#xD;
you can only answer to facts. Silence!.&#xD;
This is an awkward case; the gentle-&#xD;
man accuses the girl of taking his&#xD;
purse, but the purse isn't to be found&#xD;
upon her. Now, don't speak," said the&#xD;
inspector to Hester ; " prisoners are&#xD;
never called upon to speak here ; be-&#xD;
sides, perhaps you'd do your own cause&#xD;
harm.- I think we must lock you up,&#xD;
and on Monday you.can be examined&#xD;
before the magistrate."&#xD;
These were terrible words to Hester ;&#xD;
her gentle, ,pure, and innocent soul&#xD;
quailed within her at the thoughts of a&#xD;
public examination. -But Mr. Pike, at&#xD;
this juncture, was seen to draw forth&#xD;
from his deepest pocket a quantity of&#xD;
papers, consisting of bills, rough drafts&#xD;
of deeds, writs, and other legal docu-&#xD;
ments. He hunted among them, and&#xD;
suddenly starting, exclaimed,&#xD;
" Surprising! gentlemen; -I am&#xD;

to the portico of the house. On the&#xD;
right and left, the grass forms an ex-&#xD;
tensive sweep, relieved by beds filled&#xD;
with choice flowers ; while trees of&#xD;
various descriptions, from the laurel and&#xD;
silver fir to the ash and lime, beautify&#xD;
the grounds, and offer their grateful&#xD;
shade.&#xD;
All this is rendered doubly pleasing&#xD;
and delightful, inasmuch as the scene,&#xD;
though not in the most thickly popu-&#xD;
lated'district, is still in dusty, smoky,&#xD;
busy London, some of the very worst&#xD;
and most squalid streets lying in the&#xD;
immediate neighborhood.&#xD;
But the edifice itself now strikes the&#xD;
beholder. The size is at once apparent,&#xD;
and much exceeds that of the National&#xD;
Gallery, or the Royal Palace at Pimli-&#xD;
co. Yet the magnitude of the building&#xD;
does not detract from its beauty. The&#xD;
far-stretching balustraded wings are in&#xD;
perfect harmony with the grand centre.&#xD;
The Ionic portico of six columns, sur-&#xD;
mounted by a handsome pediment, in&#xD;
the tympanum of which are displayed&#xD;
the royal arms, has a very airy and&#xD;
elegant effect. -Immediately above rises&#xD;
the majestic doie already alluded to.&#xD;
And who occupies this edifice ? or&#xD;
for what design was it raised ? Curious&#xD;
questioner, do not start, do not turn&#xD;
aside in dissatisfaction, and say, "Can&#xD;
so muchbeauty be appropriated to such&#xD;
a purpose ?" It is not a house of jus-&#xD;
tice; it is not a convent of nuns, fast in-&#xD;
creasing as convents are in England ; it&#xD;
is not a musical hall; it is not a theatre ;&#xD;
it is a hospital for the diseased in&#xD;
spirit-it is a madhouse !&#xD;
A madhouse--the very word chills&#xD;
our hearts ; we can enter, without be-&#xD;
ing appalled, a hospital where bodily&#xD;
tortures wring the sufferers, and death&#xD;
seems to breathe in every low and sti-&#xD;
fled groan. But to walk through the&#xD;
place where the inmates exhibit the&#xD;
sickness of the soul, the godlike intel-&#xD;
lect wrapped in darkness, we shrink&#xD;
with a feeling somewhat, akin to that&#xD;
we might experience if brought in con-&#xD;
tact with disembodied spirits.&#xD;
Away ! it is an illusion-a morbid&#xD;
fancy that cheats us: there is nothing&#xD;
in'the spectacle of our rained brother&#xD;
which should excite such sentiments.&#xD;
Pity, treat kindly, but fear not the in-&#xD;

Bethlem Hospital, which derives its&#xD;
name from the Convent of Bethlehem,&#xD;
founded in 1247 by Fitz Mary, a citi-&#xD;
zen of London, on the nprth side of the&#xD;
&#xD;
Thames,. is one of-the most famous&#xD;
institutions of its class in England.&#xD;
The arrangements now, and the treat-&#xD;
ment of the insane, differ very widely&#xD;
from the system prevailing even forty&#xD;
years ago. Then chains clanked, and&#xD;
the frequent scourge raised dolorous&#xD;
cries through, the galleries and cells of&#xD;
those  melancholy abodes.*    In the&#xD;
present day mildness and persuasion,&#xD;
rather than force, characterize the treat-&#xD;
ment here, as well as elsewhere. The&#xD;
men, those at least whose insanity is of&#xD;
a harmless description, are allowed to&#xD;
amuse themselves in divers ways ; they&#xD;
play at trap-ball and leap-frog in the&#xD;
airing-grounds ; the women are en-&#xD;
couraged to employ their time in needle-&#xD;
work; and occasionally the younger&#xD;
ones may be seen, on a fine evening,&#xD;

but scenes of tranquillity and happi-&#xD;
ness. Those iron bars which fence all&#xD;
the windows in the male and female&#xD;
wings, for so are the extreme portions&#xD;
of the building termed, betray that the&#xD;
mad there will shatter and destroy.&#xD;
Those massy stone cells in the base-&#xD;

send forth still, in the dead of night,&#xD;
howlings that may wellfreeze the blood.&#xD;
The long galleries on the second floor&#xD;
contain the hopeless and - melancholy,&#xD;
whose faces, looking as if turned to&#xD;
stone, chill the beholder into awe.&#xD;
It was about three in the afternoon,&#xD;
at the date of our narrative, when a&#xD;
young woman presented herself at the&#xD;
gates of the asylum. The grounds&#xD;
then were not so extensive as they are&#xD;
at present, nor was the lodge,which we&#xD;
now see, built. The woman appeared&#xD;
well known to the porter, and he silent-&#xD;
ly admitted her. She was dressed in&#xD;
mourning, and her eyes expressed a&#xD;
deep, but quiet sorrow-the woman&#xD;

was come to see her husband. In a&#xD;
few minutes another personfollowed-&#xD;
a man. His worn and haggard look&#xD;
betrayed a grief very different from the&#xD;
sorrow of the woman. His soul was&#xD;
the prey of remorse, and he visited the&#xD;
place to inquire respecting a young&#xD;
girl whom he had loved, but forsaken;&#xD;
his conduct towards her had destroyed&#xD;
her intellect.&#xD;
A pause ensued, during which the&#xD;
porter sat on his bench in the sun. He&#xD;
had long ago, ceased to be affected by&#xD;
the anguish of the visitors, or the&#xD;
scenes of woe and fear which took&#xD;
place within the walls. So there he&#xD;
sat, admiring 4 flower with which he&#xD;
had garnished the button-hole of his&#xD;
coat, knocking his heels together, or&#xD;
humming a low song.&#xD;
The porter arose with his keys, for&#xD;
another applicant for admission stood&#xD;
at the iron gate. The old man smiled&#xD;
now as he espied a young face between&#xD;
the bars, fresh as the freshest flowers&#xD;
he could boast in his gay asylum-garden,&#xD;
yet pale and sorrowful, too, as they&#xD;
appear when drooping in the moonlight,&#xD;
all steeped with the tears of night.&#xD;
" So,.miss, you are come again, are&#xD;
you? Ha ! I fear I let you in too&#xD;
often."&#xD;
"The matron will not be angry, nor&#xD;
any person here, I am sure," said Hes-&#xD;
ter. "I have a written order for ad-&#xD;
mission."S&#xD;
" Oh! I don't doubt your order,"&#xD;
said the porter. "(ome in, my dear&#xD;

now, would be just your age. Heaven&#xD;

they say-  "&#xD;
"What.?" asked Hester, eagerly.&#xD;
"That she's- better."&#xD;
"Heaven bless you !" cried Hester,&#xD;
taking the old man's hand between her&#xD;
two little ones. The girl's heart was&#xD;
full, and she hurried towards the asy-&#xD;
lum.                             '&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER AT BETELEM HOSPITAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
How small looked the slender figure&#xD;
of Hester as she mounted the stone&#xD;
steps, and. paused for an instant be-&#xD;
&#xD;
9T&#xD;
&#xD;
neath the lofty portico ! She entered&#xD;
the hall where the two fine statues of&#xD;
" Raving aid Melancholy Madness"-.&#xD;
the work of Cibber for the old hospital&#xD;
-looked down upon the visitor. But&#xD;
Hester was familiar with the place, so&#xD;
she commenced at once ascending the&#xD;
stairs to. the second floor, where pa-&#xD;
tients whose insanity isof a harmless&#xD;
nature are confined.&#xD;
Meantime, we will glance down one&#xD;
of the galleries, some of which are of&#xD;
great length, opening on each side into&#xD;
rooms and dormitories. We are in-&#xD;
duced to follow the woman in black,&#xD;
who had arrived at the hospital a short&#xD;
time before Hester. She paused before&#xD;
a cell, the occupant of which was af-&#xD;
fected at times with fits of madness of a&#xD;
furious description, and therefore he&#xD;
was lodged on the basement floor. The&#xD;
woman now, with her dark veil thrown&#xD;
back from her face, sat tranquilly on&#xD;
the outside of the bars, looking at her&#xD;
husband. The man within was walk-&#xD;
ing to and fro, and did not appear to&#xD;
notice her.  His garments were com-&#xD;
posed of a coarse stuff, like sacking, so&#xD;
that the material being very strong he&#xD;
was unable to rend them. His beard&#xD;
was long, for he would allow no one to&#xD;
shave hini.  Beheld in certain posi-&#xD;
tions, his face was handsome, and had&#xD;
a highly intellectual cast. In a corner&#xD;
of the cell laya bundle of green rushes,&#xD;
for he was continually calling for&#xD;
rushes, and when the keepers- refused&#xD;
to supply him he became furious.&#xD;
Stooping now, he gathered up a few in&#xD;
his long fingers, and began busy&#xD;
weaving them into a circlet. In a few&#xD;
minutes his task was completed, and&#xD;
the maniac, placing his rush crown&#xD;
proudly on his head, strode up to the&#xD;
front of the bars.&#xD;
"Yes, I will wear it," he cried, ex-&#xD;
ultingly. "If the world will not crown&#xD;
me with the bays of Parnassus, I will&#xD;
crown myself. Petrarch was crowned&#xD;
by the senate in the eternal city of&#xD;
Rome ; and for what ?-inditing a few&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
improving; she has raved less of his&#xD;
cruelty ; her thoughts have more coher-&#xD;
ence, and her affections seem wander-&#xD;
ing back to their former channel ; she&#xD;
now leans on his arm, and her sleepless&#xD;
eyes, that lately burned with fire, are&#xD;
filled with tears. Low, soft, endearing&#xD;
words are breathing from her lips,&#xD;
which assume again their fresh coral&#xD;
hue. How plaintively fall those tender&#xD;
accents !&#xD;
"My heart was broken, but it may&#xD;
yet healif you never forsake me again.&#xD;
You were a heaven to my miserable&#xD;
lost soul, and still I am  yours, only&#xD;
yours, in time and eternity. My brain&#xD;
wanders-I am mad--I am lifted above&#xD;
the earth-but still my madness is love&#xD;
for you. Then say'you will not fly&#xD;
from me ; let me live here, here in your&#xD;
bosom, my home, my palace, my de-&#xD;
fence, my all. And if you will not take&#xD;
me as a wife, let me be your servant---&#xD;
a faithful dog following your footsteps&#xD;
.- a bird-anything rather than be&#xD;
sent away. Do not, oh, do not cast me&#xD;
from you !"&#xD;
Then the fair arms were thrown&#xD;
around him, and passionate entreaties&#xD;
were poured forth, with the wild apos-&#xD;
trophes of the still unsettled spirit.&#xD;
Woman ! beautiful thou art in thy love-&#xD;
ly and loving nature, even in madness.&#xD;
The intellect may be a wreck,,the high&#xD;
aims of life forgotten, and religion blot-&#xD;
ted out from the frenzied soul; but what&#xD;
shall quench the enduring spark of the&#xD;
affections?&#xD;
Hester crept towards the door of the&#xD;
small room in which her mother was&#xD;
confined. The people of the asylum&#xD;
well knew her, and therefore she had&#xD;
been allowed to pass unquestioned.&#xD;
The door in a few minutes wassopened&#xD;
by the nurse.&#xD;
Mrs. Somerset, we have elsewhere&#xD;
observed, had always been in her de-&#xD;
portment tranquil and reserved, while&#xD;
her beauty was of that description&#xD;
which may be termed the dignified.&#xD;
She appeared now to be in a state of&#xD;
apathy, leaning back in an easy chair,&#xD;
with her feet on a stool. Her cheek&#xD;
was colorless ; her hand, which dropped&#xD;
over the chair-arm, was cold as ice:&#xD;
and her eyes listlessly wandered from&#xD;
object to object. She rarely whispered&#xD;
to herself, as the insane are accustomed&#xD;
todo'; nor were any gestures made by&#xD;
her, except that occasionally she would&#xD;
raise her right'hand, and wave it im-&#xD;
&#xD;
99&#xD;
&#xD;
periously, as if repulsing some object;&#xD;
at the same time, her face would as-&#xD;
sume a severe, even fierce, expression,&#xD;
and she would mutter, "Fiend, fiend !&#xD;
thine is not love !" These were the&#xD;
only intelligible words she had spoken&#xD;
for a month, but they had been repeat-&#xD;
ed every day.&#xD;
Such was Mrs. Somerset, still stately&#xD;
in her bearing, and handsome in her&#xD;
person, though the fine threads of the&#xD;
brain had become entangled, and the&#xD;
mind paralyzed by suffering, the work&#xD;
of him who sought revenge, and had&#xD;
gained it-Roland Hartley.&#xD;
Hester approached without speaking,&#xD;
and seated herself close by the chair&#xD;
of her mother. She glanced at her by&#xD;
stealth, and asked questions in whis-&#xD;
pers of the nurse. A slight but favor-&#xD;
able changed seemed to have taken&#xD;
place in the invalid ; her manner was&#xD;
less abstracted, and there was more in-&#xD;
telligence in the expression of the face.&#xD;
For a very long period the mother had&#xD;
not returned any direct or reasonable&#xD;
reply to the daughter's inquiries, and&#xD;
she seemed to have lost all recollection&#xD;
of events, persons, and things, being&#xD;
dead to the living world.&#xD;
"Mother!" Hester ventured to say,&#xD;
taking the hand of ice, and kissing it.&#xD;
That word, associated in woman's&#xD;
heart with so many sweet and holy&#xD;
feelings, evidently affected Mrs. Somer-&#xD;
set, for she raised her head, and gazing&#xD;
around, faintly exclaimed,&#xD;
"Mother ! What does that mean?&#xD;
Who calls?"&#xD;
The gentle appeal was repeated.&#xD;
"I know that voice. Girl, who are&#xD;
you? -What do you want?"&#xD;
This gleam of reviving sense filled&#xD;
Hester's heart with hope and pleasure.&#xD;
" I am your daughter-your child,&#xD;
Hester."&#xD;
"Hester !" said the poor woman,&#xD;
placing her hand on her forehead, and&#xD;
beating rapidly with her fingers, like&#xD;
one who strives to rouse dormant&#xD;
memory. "I think I have heard that&#xD;
name before. Yes, Brookland Hall-&#xD;
Hartley-no, "Hugh, Hugh."&#xD;
"Hugh," repeated Hester, desirous&#xD;
of leading her on to talk of Mr. Somer-&#xD;
set. " Father is quite well."&#xD;
4 Who is well? I wish I was, for I&#xD;
nearer sleep. Ten thousand figures are&#xD;
dancing before my eyes, and a fire is&#xD;
always -burning here -here, in my&#xD;
brain." -&#xD;
&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You sleep at night, dear mother ?"&#xD;
"I never close my eyes. I have not&#xD;
slept for two years. Oh, no !-I shall&#xD;
never sleep- again." She lifted both&#xD;
her hands, and repeated: "Never sleep&#xD;
again, until my bed is the grave."-&#xD;
There was a pause ; Hester leant&#xD;
forward, and covered her face - she&#xD;
then heard her mother move7aew&#xD;
steps from her chair, and, turning, saw&#xD;
her gesticulating in the manner al-&#xD;
ready mentioned. _ Alas ! a lucid in-&#xD;
terval was notyet come. The unhappy&#xD;
woman waved herihand, slowly moving&#xD;
backwards as she spoke:-&#xD;
"Hypocrite! I defy thee-! Monster!&#xD;
work out thy revenge ! All the fiends&#xD;
below have entered into thy soul-but&#xD;
I defy thee!"&#xD;
Her hands, as if suddenly arrested,&#xD;
remained above her head ; her teeth&#xD;
were set ; her black eyes were dilated,&#xD;
and darted fire ; her high brow con-&#xD;
tracting, seemed to speak indignation;&#xD;
her look was beautifully terrific-=the&#xD;
look of the Pythia, when, on the Del-&#xD;
phian tripod, she delivered her oracles&#xD;
in passionate inspiration and poetic&#xD;
madness.&#xD;
The daughter approached the mother&#xD;
as the latter stood in that fixed attitude;&#xD;
and the young, fragile girl hung upon&#xD;
her arm, and looked piteously into her&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Be calm, mother-you remember&#xD;
me now.".&#xD;
The stately lady looked down upon&#xD;
her child with a meaningless stare.&#xD;
The large eyes were fixed upon her,&#xD;
yet Hester did not turn away in fear.&#xD;
Gradually the eyes resigned their fero-&#xD;
cious expression, and the pallid, face of&#xD;
the maniac stooped nearer. The lips&#xD;
moved, but the low   murmurs did&#xD;
not shape themselves into articulate&#xD;
words.  A. softened expression stole&#xD;
over the countenance, and the arms&#xD;
falling, slowly enfolded the form of&#xD;
Rester. The light of old affection was&#xD;
gleaming through the mist of forgetful-&#xD;
ness ; the heart was struggling with the&#xD;
brain. Close, more closely, the parent&#xD;
strained her child to her breast; in spite&#xD;
of rebel Reason, omnipotent Nature&#xD;
claimed her sway; and Mrs. Somerset&#xD;
found in Rester something she had&#xD;
known and lost, though unconscious&#xD;
where - something which s4e loved,&#xD;
yet knew not why.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER AMONG THE PICTURE-DEALERS.--&#xD;
THE BROKER oF THE "SEVEN DIALS,"&#xD;
THE INGENIOUS "MAKER OF THE OLD&#xD;
MASTERS."&#xD;
IT was about eleven in the forenoon,&#xD;
when the light figure of Hester might&#xD;
have been seen gliding along Fleet-&#xD;
street. Under her arm she carried a&#xD;
small portfolio, which contained the&#xD;
produce of a fortnight's artistic labor,&#xD;
consisting of four pieces in water-colors,&#xD;
and the little oil landscape of which&#xD;
we have had occasion to speak. She&#xD;
had toiled exclusively on these draw-&#xD;
ings, having suspended even her night-&#xD;
ly occupation of netting purses. To&#xD;
equal, therefore, her' former gains, and&#xD;
defray the expense oficanvas, paint, and&#xD;
paper, it was necessary that she should&#xD;
receive for her performances about&#xD;
three pounds.&#xD;
On Hester tripped, anxious to learn&#xD;
what success might await her new&#xD;
speculation. Reaching the entrance of&#xD;
the Temple, where the old doors open&#xD;
upon Fleet-street, she turned pale, and&#xD;
trembled. The image of the dreaded&#xD;
Hartley within those walls seemed to&#xD;
rise before  her.  Mechanically she&#xD;
crossed to the opposite side, and looked&#xD;
over her shoulder, to see that he was&#xD;
not actually following her ; and this&#xD;
natural gesture of fear.was continued&#xD;
until the black arch of Temple Bar&#xD;
having been passed, that massy relic&#xD;
of by-gone days concealed Fleet-street&#xD;
and the Temple from'her sight.&#xD;
The first shops that Hester entered&#xD;
were those of fancy-dealers,' whose&#xD;
windows displayed an endless variety of&#xD;
articles of an ornamental nature. Some&#xD;
of the shopkeepers treated her with*&#xD;
neglect, and a few with rudeness. In&#xD;
one place, however, she met with court-&#xD;
esy; the master was an elderly man,&#xD;
and, looking kindly at the vendor and&#xD;
her wares, expressed an inclination to&#xD;
become a purchaser. With his spec-&#xD;
tacles on his nose, he scrutinized the&#xD;
flower-drawings, smiled, shook  his&#xD;
head, but still his look was very bene-&#xD;
volent.&#xD;
Pretty well-may do for screens,"&#xD;
said the fancy-dealer. " Many nice&#xD;
touches ; must have taken you, miss,&#xD;
some time. Sorry we can give so little&#xD;
for these kind of things now; but the&#xD;
fact is, so many artists in the field."&#xD;
&#xD;
101&#xD;
&#xD;
t I do not expect a high price," said&#xD;
Hester.&#xD;
.Right - sensibly spoken.  High&#xD;
price ?-no, indeed.  But let me see,&#xD;
you shall have their worth-that is, the&#xD;
trade price.  Two fruit pieces: two&#xD;
flower ditto. I'll give you a shilling&#xD;
each."&#xD;
Hester's blank countenance express-&#xD;
ed surprise and sorrow.&#xD;
"You don't speak, my girl. Isn't it&#xD;
enough ?"&#xD;
" The paper ;alone cost me half the&#xD;
money. If I sell them at the price you&#xD;
name, I shall have labored five days&#xD;
for two shillings."&#xD;
"Sorry for that, my dear child, but&#xD;
must learn to paint faster. Quantity,&#xD;
swiftness, that's the order of the day-&#xD;
ha, ha, ha ! But come, won't be hard,"&#xD;
added the man, taking out five shil-&#xD;
lings from his till ; " say three pence&#xD;
more-fifteen pence apiece-therec!"&#xD;
Little as this was, Hester, fearful she&#xD;
might be offered even less elsewhere,&#xD;
received the money with an inward&#xD;
sigh, and, returning her quiet thanks,&#xD;
stepped out of the shop.&#xD;
Her chief hope remained-her oil&#xD;
landscape, representing the Norfolk&#xD;
farm, the cattle, and the peasant boy.&#xD;
This might set all right, and handsome-&#xD;
ly remunerate her for her labor. There&#xD;
was no lack of picture-marts; the&#xD;
Strand, Pall Mall, Piccadilly, were&#xD;
dotted with then; they abounded in&#xD;
every street ; but their showy entrances&#xD;
abashed and daunted Hester, and it&#xD;
*as some time before she could muster&#xD;
sufficient courage to open one of the&#xD;
high glass doors.  At length she en-&#xD;
tered a shop in Piccadilly ; it displayed&#xD;
bright new paintings, and dingy old&#xD;
ones, and was garnished with great&#xD;
gilded, staring frames.  Hester, in&#xD;
nervous agitation, approached him who&#xD;
appeared to be the master, but her&#xD;
hand trembled to such a degree that it&#xD;
was with difficulty she could unie her&#xD;
portfolio, and produce her painting.&#xD;
As the "great dealer," the man of&#xD;
Titians, Claudes, and Dominichinos,&#xD;
took the landscape into his hand, he&#xD;
just glanced at it, and then politely&#xD;
asked the name of the artist.&#xD;
"Oh ! yourself," said the gentleman.&#xD;
4I confess I never heard of your name&#xD;
before;" and a look of surprise over-&#xD;
spread his dark and solemn'face. Hes-&#xD;
ter considered this -a good omen; he&#xD;
&#xD;
n,            -    ,.y.a....a v               -,              s.. .ti.                              i...,&#xD;
&#xD;
might be surprised that an obscure girl&#xD;
could produce the painting he saw.&#xD;
The connoisseur, whose dignity per-&#xD;
mitted him to utter but a few words,&#xD;
returned the landscape with one hand,&#xD;
and, with the other, pointed at his&#xD;
glass door.' "Good-morning," he said.&#xD;
" Do you not purchase paintings,&#xD;
then?"&#xD;
"Certainly we do."&#xD;
"Will you not kindly offer some-&#xD;
thing for mine ?"&#xD;
The look of surprise increased, and&#xD;
the eyes opened to a staring width.&#xD;
"I am astonished, young woman,&#xD;
at your asking such a question. Don't-&#xD;
you know great firms, like' ours, never&#xD;
buy obscure pictures ? We sell nothing&#xD;
but first-rate names, and therefore; of&#xD;
course, cannot purchase any   but&#xD;
them."&#xD;
tm""I -don't say,"' observed Hester;&#xD;
rather puzzled by the gentleman's&#xD;
words, that mine is a good painting;&#xD;
but this, perhaps, is your meaning--&#xD;
however good my performance might&#xD;
be, you could not purchase it."&#xD;
"Certainly n t."&#xD;
"Is that picture," asked Hester,&#xD;
emboldened, for her spirit was rising&#xD;
-is' that little picture which I see;&#xD;
against the wall yonder by a high&#xD;
name?&#xD;
It was a small landscape, somewhat&#xD;
resembling her own, except that the&#xD;
farm-house ,was one daub, the cattle'&#xD;
like round red spots of ochre 'dropped&#xD;
at random on the canvas, while the&#xD;
figures resembled orang-outangs rather&#xD;
than human beings. The gentleman,&#xD;
the servile worshipper of fashion and&#xD;
names, gravely told her the landscape&#xD;
was invaluable-worth at least five&#xD;
hundred guineas ; it was a real-.&#xD;
Rester could not recollect the Dutch-&#xD;
man's hard and barbarous name; she&#xD;
only felt assured that, were the picture&#xD;
by her hand, the highest sum she should&#xD;
dare-ask for it would be about asmany&#xD;
shillings as the dealer asked hundred&#xD;
guineas. Alas ! she had yet'to learn a&#xD;
stern lesson,, and become acquainted&#xD;
with a most -melancholy prejudice&#xD;
which prevails;in the world of art.&#xD;
Paintings are rarely or never judged&#xD;
by their intrinsic merits, but are valued'&#xD;
in an exact proportion to the notoriety&#xD;
or fame .attached to the party by whom&#xD;
they may happen to be drawn. A&#xD;
very memorable instance of this truth&#xD;

e&#xD;
&#xD;
mittee of "enlightened men," great&#xD;
critics and judges of the fine arts, pur-&#xD;
chased for our National Gallery, at the&#xD;
cost of many hundreds of pounds, a pic-&#xD;
ture said to be a real Holbein. In a&#xD;
few months this painting was discover-&#xD;
ed to be not a real Holbein. There it&#xD;
hung, its merits, if it possessed any,pre-&#xD;
cisely the same as-before the discovery,&#xD;
the difference only existing in the feel-&#xD;
ings of the trustees. It was without&#xD;
delay degraded from its place, cast forth&#xD;
in scorn, and the- picture for which&#xD;
nearly a thousand pounds,.we believe,&#xD;
had been given, would not now very&#xD;
probably fetch the sum of one guinea.&#xD;
The connoisseur of Piccadilly, deigning&#xD;
not to say another word to Hester,&#xD;
again stretched his ringed hand towards&#xD;
the door, and the fair artist, convinced&#xD;
that any further appeal would be use-&#xD;
less, quitted the, room  of renowned&#xD;
names and enlightened criticism with a&#xD;
heavy heart.)&#xD;
Other picture establishments in the&#xD;
neighborhood Hester in turn visited;&#xD;
but the same answer, varying only in&#xD;
the mode of expression, was given her&#xD;
as by the connoisseur of Piccadilly.&#xD;
We do not say her painting was a fine&#xD;
one; it was only a passable performance&#xD;
by a young hand; but had its merit&#xD;
been great, its fate, we believe, would,&#xD;
under the circumstances, have teen&#xD;
precisely similar. She was advised to&#xD;
apply to a small broker, pnd this, in-&#xD;
deed, was the best course the poor girl&#xD;
could now pursue. Already exhausted&#xD;
by her long and weary journeyings to&#xD;
and fro, we see her passing through sun-&#xD;
dry narrow and dirty streets in the vici-&#xD;
nity of Covent Garden. At length she&#xD;
perceives the name of a certain street,&#xD;
which, forgetting its previous crooked-&#xD;
ness, runs in a direct line to a. point&#xD;
where seven other streets meet, giving&#xD;
to the locality the picturesque name of&#xD;
the " Seven Dials." .&#xD;
" Ah i this is the place," said Hes-&#xD;
ter, to herself; " I shall find the shop&#xD;
they spoke of here."&#xD;
Ina-few minutes she paused before&#xD;
a house, the front of-which, protruding&#xD;
rather beyond its fellows, formed a&#xD;
shop of .a very, singular description.&#xD;
Old spinets were here mixed up with&#xD;
cane-bottomed chairs; dingy tables and&#xD;
rusty fire-irons were relieved by pieces&#xD;
of bright-colored carpet, all warranted&#xD;
nearly new. Monsters, and curiosities,&#xD;
in the shape of serpent's skins, stuked&#xD;
&#xD;
103&#xD;
&#xD;
monkeys, and-one real alligator's mail-&#xD;
like case, hung from the ceiling. The&#xD;
display of pictures, too, was consider-&#xD;
able. Old and new, oil and water-&#xD;
colored, little and great, were piled up,&#xD;
and suspended on the walls in beauti-&#xD;
ful confusion. Hester entered this em-&#xD;
porium, and, advancing a few steps,&#xD;
perceived a, man sitting in the centre&#xD;
of the room on a low stool. His coat&#xD;
was off; his legs, for ease and comfort,&#xD;
were hoisted upon a neighboring chair,&#xD;
and he was quietly smoking a pipe. His&#xD;
sallow cheeks, his eagle nose, and the&#xD;
crafty but very intellectual expression,&#xD;
of the dark eyes, betrayed him to be a&#xD;
member of that wondrous family-the&#xD;
people who have preserved their reli-&#xD;
gion and their personal characteristics&#xD;
unchanged, through all their troubles,&#xD;
their wanderings, and the persecutions&#xD;
.which have assailed them, since the&#xD;
age when hoary Nile saw the mighty&#xD;
Pharaohs enthroned on his banks.&#xD;
Mr. Methuselah Moses,y perceiving&#xD;
Hester enter with her portfolio, partly&#xD;
guessed her business. He did not rise {,&#xD;
from his stool,.but merely nodded his&#xD;
head, and continued his smoking, so&#xD;
that the-white and odorous vapor, issu-&#xD;
ing at stated periods from one drawn-&#xD;
down corner of his mouth, mounted&#xD;
in picturesque wreaths, half veiling his&#xD;
large hooked nose, -and hanging like a&#xD;
crown of glory above his head.&#xD;
"You purchase pictures, I believe ?"&#xD;
began Hester, hesitatingly,     4&#xD;
" Purchase?  Certainly, my dear ;&#xD;
yes, yes, yes," answered Mr. Moses,&#xD;
with a sharp nasal twang ; " but I&#xD;
would rather sell, any day-rather sell;&#xD;
yes, yes.'-&#xD;
"I have a small oil-painting, repre-&#xD;
senting a landscape in Norfolk-"&#xD;
" Well, never mind where the land-&#xD;
scape is, let's see it," said the Jew,&#xD;
holding his pipe .in his left hand.&#xD;
Hester opened her portfolio, and gave&#xD;
the painting to .the broker. As his&#xD;
sharp eyes scrutinized the piece, he&#xD;
nodded his head briskly, and smoked&#xD;
with quicker and-more ferocious puffs.&#xD;
"What d'ye call this?-oil-painting.&#xD;
What master is it after ?-Gainsbo-&#xD;
rough, Moreland, Cuyp, or Teniers ?"&#xD;
"I have copied it from no master ; it&#xD;
is my own."&#xD;
" So much the worse. Buy?     I'd&#xD;
rather sell, I say-rather sell. Young&#xD;

4&#xD;
&#xD;
a dignified manner, "look around you;&#xD;

Hester cast a melancholy glance in&#xD;
the direction intimated. What to her&#xD;
were the broker's pictures, good or&#xD;
bad? they would not put bread into&#xD;
her mouth, or assist her in her grand&#xD;
design of releasing her father from&#xD;
prison. Oh! she felt she was toiling'&#xD;
for something dearer, holier far than&#xD;
fame.&#xD;
"Real ones, a'n't they ?" said the&#xD;
Jew ; " and all done by the right&#xD;
masters: yes, yes, yes. That's a Cuyp,&#xD;
that's a Teniers; and that's a Moreland.&#xD;
Ho ! ho ! I've got them !"&#xD;
"Strange," thought Hester, as she&#xD;
stood musing for a moment; "here, in-&#xD;
this mean shop, I find the same spirit&#xD;
actuating the owner as prevails in the&#xD;
fashionable marts of St. James's ; the&#xD;
same bowing down to names ; the same&#xD;
hero-worship ; man the very slave of&#xD;
prejudice and fashion, and wholly un-&#xD;
able, or, if able, not daring, to. form a&#xD;
judgment for himself."&#xD;
" Ah ! could you come up to that&#xD;
Teniers, now-"     The Hebrew sud-&#xD;
denly checked himself, and rose from&#xD;
his stool. "But 'tis of no use talking.&#xD;
You want to sell the picter ?"&#xD;
" Yes, I do."&#xD;
"Well, listen to me," pursued Mr.&#xD;
Moses, after he had meditated for some&#xD;
minutes. "You don't want ability, I&#xD;
think; but this piece, fair little laad-&#xD;
scape as it is, done by a modern, and&#xD;
a painter, too, without a name, is just&#xD;
worth nothing at all, or, at most, four&#xD;
shillings."&#xD;
" Four shillings ?" cried Hester, in&#xD;
a tone of voice betraying too plainly&#xD;
the keenness of her disappointment.&#xD;
" Stop, young woman, not so fast. I&#xD;
say its present worth is four shillings;&#xD;
but," exclaimed Mr. Moses, turning up&#xD;
his little canning eyes, and winking&#xD;
significantly, "do you think you could&#xD;
make it into something else-say a&#xD;
Cayp ?"&#xD;
"Make it into a Cuyp ? What do&#xD;
you mean ?"&#xD;
" Ah !rsee you don't take ; not been&#xD;
long in London, I suppose. Now, I'll&#xD;
tell you a secret, for you shall paint for&#xD;
me, and then it won't be to your inte-&#xD;
rest to tell tales. My chief business is&#xD;
to collect Uuyps, Tenierses, Morelands,&#xD;
and so on. I don't expect to sell them&#xD;
here; people are to poor in the 'Dials'&#xD;
for that; but I supply great West-End&#xD;
&#xD;
dealers with these choice picrs by the&#xD;
old masters. I employ several painters,&#xD;
young hands who job cheap; for cheap-&#xD;
ness, my dear, is everything. Well, I&#xD;
think you'd suit me ; for this landscape,&#xD;
with the cows, the fields, and the ragged&#xD;
boy, might be made into a bootiful&#xD;
Cuyp, or, at least, into avery respect-&#xD;
able Moreland."&#xD;
Hester was still rather perplexed,&#xD;
though her mind was gradually becomi-&#xD;
ing enlightened.&#xD;
"Now," said this collector, or maker&#xD;
of the old masters, " just take your&#xD;
landscape home; give it a dingy and a&#xD;
brown hue all over. I think if you&#xD;
were to hang it up your- chimley for&#xD;
about twenty-four hours 'twould be as&#xD;
well; that is, if the chimley hasn't a&#xD;
register-stove."&#xD;
"Hang the picture up the-himney I"&#xD;
said Hester, astonished; " and why ?"&#xD;
" To smoke it, of course ; for then&#xD;
'twill look old. My artists generally&#xD;
find this the best plan ; and I alwys&#xD;
recommend the chinley-back, espe-&#xD;
ciallyn in making the Cuyps and the&#xD;
Tenierses."&#xD;
Hester now perfectly understood the&#xD;
object which the ingenious Mr."Moses&#xD;
had in view, yet she was unable to re-&#xD;
gard such a proceeding in any other&#xD;
light than that of base fraud. Only&#xD;
surprised was she that any respectable&#xD;
dealers could patronize such a man, or&#xD;
wink at practices so thoroughly unprin-&#xD;
cipled. She marvelled, too, that the&#xD;
public could be so dupedl; but Mr.&#xD;
Methusaleh Moses was better acquaint-&#xD;
ed with the world than Hester Somer-&#xD;
set, and was profoundly skilled in the&#xD;
philosophy which teaches the many to&#xD;
follow the few.&#xD;
"Then you won't take the drawing&#xD;
home, and do as I tell you ?" said the&#xD;
broker, observing that Hester hesitated.&#xD;
"No, I cannot be guilty of such a&#xD;
deception."&#xD;
"Oh I never mind," observed the&#xD;
Jew, resuming his place on his stool,&#xD;
and taking his pipe. " Don't put it up&#xD;
the chimley then ; I never force artists&#xD;
to make money against their will; if&#xD;
they refuse to get their fortunes by&#xD;
doing as I tell them,' 'tis their own&#xD;
fault. I never push sovereigns into&#xD;
their hands. Good-day."&#xD;
"But will you not take the landscape&#xD;
just as it is?"&#xD;
"What I all fresh and fair, and done&#xD;
by somebody living, and, worse than&#xD;

all, by  somebody  nobody  knows?&#xD;
Why, such a picter, I say, is worthless&#xD;
in the trade ; however,"' added Mr.&#xD;
Moses, musingly, scratching his ear,&#xD;
with the tip of his pipe, " as you seem&#xD;
a good girl, and a young hand, I'll&#xD;
encourage you, though 'tis like giving&#xD;
money for nothing ; you shall have&#xD;
seven shillings for your landscape-&#xD;
there !"&#xD;
"Seven shillings ? Night and day,&#xD;
have I labored at this piece for more&#xD;
than a week."&#xD;
" I can't help it if you've worked&#xD;
more than a yearyoung woman. That's&#xD;
my price, and I°don't think you'll get'&#xD;
any broker to give more.".&#xD;
The head of the Jew, with his fine&#xD;
Rembrandt-like profile, was again ob-&#xD;
scured by wreaths of fragrant smoke.&#xD;
Hester, who thought of the cold treat-&#xD;
ment she had already experienced at&#xD;
the hands of other picture-dealers, felt&#xD;
loath to quit the place.{&#xD;
"Well, will you take the money, or&#xD;
are you going?" said Mr. Moses fromi&#xD;
out of his impenetrable cloud.&#xD;
Hester drew a few steps nearer, and.&#xD;
her low sigh might have been heard.&#xD;
"1The poorest artisan gets double by&#xD;
his labors.. Even if I were to sweep a&#xD;
corner of a street-"&#xD;
" Now, never mind artisans and the&#xD;
streets ; sell the drawing, or go !"&#xD;
"Say," exclaimed Hester, with' a&#xD;
desperate effort, " say nine shillings !"&#xD;
" Not a farthing more. In selling I&#xD;
sometimes 'bate, but in buying never'&#xD;
rise. Here's thecash."   -&#xD;
The bony hand was thrust forward&#xD;
beyond the cloud, and seven shillings&#xD;
lay in the man's palm. Hester, with&#xD;
a sad and slow motion, .took the few&#xD;
coins, and then quitted the residence of&#xD;
Mr, Methusaleh Moses, the celebrated&#xD;
" maker of the old masters."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
[R. PIKE AND HIS SOLITARY DINNER.-&#xD;
'THE FAIR ARTIST'S LAST HOPE.&#xD;
"WHAT! she'has taken to drawing,&#xD;
has she'?" said the attorney of St. Mary-&#xD;
Axe, as he threw himself into a chair&#xD;
in his kitchen with a black dissatisfied&#xD;
countenance. The door communicdting&#xD;
with his office stood ajar, so that he&#xD;
could espy any client, if such aniindi-&#xD;
&#xD;
vidual should happen to enter. Mr.&#xD;
Pike was busily employed in cooking&#xD;
his dinner, for, though -possessingmany&#xD;
thousands of pounds, he did not commit'&#xD;
the extravagant enormity of keeping a&#xD;
servant.&#xD;
"Drawing! That's vexatious. Some-&#xD;
thing may be got by that. The girl-&#xD;
will make money," pursued the solilo-&#xD;
quist. "Have we labored, then, for&#xD;
nothing ?-caused her to be discharged&#xD;
from Regent-street only to throw her&#xD;
on another track ? Why, she may even&#xD;
improve her fortunes. What will Hart-.&#xD;
ley say to this ?"&#xD;
Mr. Pike scowled an ominous scowl.&#xD;
He then rose, and turned his red herring&#xD;
on the gridiron. This was his dinner;,&#xD;
for the. fundholder indulged in the&#xD;
luxury of animal food only once a week.&#xD;
He couldn't afford it oftener.&#xD;
"She'll make money. Ah! now I.&#xD;
think of money, I'll just add that eight&#xD;
hundred pounds at once to the sum in-&#xD;
consols, for the stocks are very favorable&#xD;
for an investment. I'm getting on a&#xD;
little-getting on. Well, it's- every&#xD;
man's duty to provide for his old age.&#xD;
Heaven and reason bid him do it. Yes,&#xD;
'tis a solemn and religious obligation.&#xD;
Pooh! the girl need not think of this&#xD;
yet. She is young, but I am growing&#xD;
old. Therefore, if I can get anything&#xD;
by stopping her proceedings, I act but&#xD;
fairly, and in accordance with the&#xD;
dictates of justice ands reason. Yes,&#xD;
yes, I am all right;.and my conscience,&#xD;
I rejoice to think, is perfectly clear."&#xD;
Then the worthy gentleman, be-&#xD;
coming more composed and happy,&#xD;
spread his cloth, and placed his dinner&#xD;
on the table. A frugal meal, in truth,&#xD;
it might be, a herring and potato ;&#xD;
but so many sweet and pleasurable&#xD;
visions of saving and amassing hovered&#xD;
above the scanty board, that we doubt&#xD;
much whether an epicure ever expe-&#xD;
rienced more satisfaction over his&#xD;
venison and - champagne than that&#xD;
miser derived from his solitary rand&#xD;
miserable repast.&#xD;
"We must stop her," murmured Mr.&#xD;
Pike, at every interval which occurred&#xD;
in his eating. " We will stop her,"&#xD;
he still said, as he placed down the&#xD;
glass, having drained the cold water it&#xD;
contained. " Ay, we will stop her."&#xD;
Putting away his dinner things, and&#xD;
raking out his Aire to save the expense&#xD;
of coals, Mr. Pike stepped into his&#xD;
office. There he remained alone, lean.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET,&#xD;
&#xD;
ing back in his chair. Yet it was not&#xD;
to enjoy an afternoon siesta. No; the&#xD;
mind was too active to suffer the body&#xD;
to indulge in sleep, so long as the sun&#xD;
continued above the horizon. He was&#xD;
wrapped in meditation. First his law&#xD;
business claimed his thoughts-; then&#xD;
his connection with Hartley, -and the&#xD;
best method of frustrating the designs&#xD;
of Hester, put his mind on the stretch.&#xD;
But these themes for reflection ultimate-&#xD;
ly gave place to the cherished subject&#xD;
of his heart. le mused on his increas-&#xD;
ing hoard ; guinea added to guinea,&#xD;
thousand to thousand. Oh, the dear,&#xD;
delicious, soul-absorbing dream! Say&#xD;
:nt themiser, while he starves his body,&#xD;
and drops by inches, through emacia-&#xD;
tion and feebleness, into the grave-say&#xD;
not he has no reward on earth. Shut&#xD;
out from his brain the imageofthe&#xD;
tomb, and it is the wild, sweet intoxica-&#xD;
:tion of the opium-eater that he feels.&#xD;
.Eis very frenzyis an excess of rapture;&#xD;
and helaughs at the astronomer- and&#xD;
his glittering stars when he surveys his&#xD;
heaps; more bright and precious;in his&#xD;
eyes than the golden orbs of heaven..&#xD;
And did Hester, after the little en-&#xD;
couragement she received, relinquish&#xD;
her. efforts with the pencil and brush?&#xD;
Notyet. -She resolvedon concentrating&#xD;
.her powers, and bestowing a greater&#xD;
length of time on one piece.' The sub-&#xD;
ject of the intended paintingwas Brook-&#xD;
land Hall and the surrounding scenery.&#xD;
Each spotwhereier infancy was passed&#xD;
had so inpressed.itself on her mind,'&#xD;
that she experienced no dif iculty in&#xD;
drawing entirely-from memory. The&#xD;
painting, when completed,wasintended:&#xD;
to be hung for sale in -one of the ba-&#xD;
saars. Week after week passed, and&#xD;
still Hester toiled at her easel. Mean&#xD;
tinie she lived on the little which she'&#xD;
had previously contrived to save. It&#xD;
was or a great stake 'that ;he thea;&#xD;
success would be triumph4  .utshuld&#xD;
the. performance prove a"lure, the&#xD;
defeat to her would be ca  ous=in-&#xD;
deed.&#xD;
Mr. Somersetwas aware of his daugh-&#xD;
ter'spursuit, and the subject on-whieh'&#xD;
her ;pencil was employed.   Hester&#xD;
assured him that her labor would-be&#xD;
certain this tinie of gaining a handsome'&#xD;
recompense, and the ol-l gentleman&#xD;
hoped andf prayed such  ight beathe&#xD;
case. Brookland Hall-how   dear it'&#xD;
was to-thememory of the ruinedaand&#xD;
captive man! how lovely the house and&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
105&#xD;
&#xD;
domain of his ancestors;still shone on&#xD;
the mirror of his fancy! Such a pic.-&#xD;
ture, he thought, even - if indifferently&#xD;
executed, must needs be beautiful.&#xD;
And Hester completed her task. As&#xD;
as work of art, independently of its&#xD;
associations, the picture was good. -In&#xD;
truth, the 'indefatigable young artist&#xD;
had surpassed herself. And now, at&#xD;
his urgent request, she was to take it&#xD;
to her father in the prison; for Mr.&#xD;
Somerset would delighthis eyes with&#xD;
it, and congratulate his child previously&#xD;
to its being exposed for sale. With&#xD;
feelings of pride and happiness, Hester&#xD;
consented to his wish. As, however, the&#xD;
painting was - of rather large diinen-&#xD;
sions, she could not herself very well&#xD;
transport it to the Fleet- Prison ; but&#xD;
she hired a boy, *rho, for a small sum,&#xD;
would ,carry it on his shoulder. One&#xD;
thought gave her great satisfaction:&#xD;
Mr. Hartley's solicitor, Pike, could not&#xD;
persecute her now, for what shouldlhe&#xD;
know of her present movements ? Even&#xD;
if he discovered, her  ainting in the&#xD;
bazaar, it was not likelyshe'thoughi,&#xD;
he would remain there all day depreP&#xD;
ciating its merits, so as toprevent&#xD;
people 'from. purchasing it  No, she&#xD;
was secure from his miachinations now.&#xD;
Crafty, subtle, sneaking little'Pike I&#xD;
peering into corners with untiring in-&#xD;
dustry, and gaining intelligence we&#xD;
scarcely know -how, 'thy secret' agency,&#xD;
we grieve to say, was not so easily elud-&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
" Take great care," said Hester to the&#xD;
boy, as he carried the painting before&#xD;
her down Fleet-lane in'the direction&#xD;
of the prison. "When we reach the&#xD;
door I will knock, and you have only&#xD;
to walk straight through the passage&#xD;
into the further yard. Oh ! stop one&#xD;
instant; I have left something at my&#xD;
lodgings, and which my father must&#xD;
I have."&#xD;
She had indeed forgotten her purse .&#xD;
the last shilling in which was to be&#xD;
given to her "father that morning.&#xD;
Lightly Hester'tripped back, while the&#xD;
boy remained stanZig  on the pave-&#xD;
npent, the picture on his shoulder, le&#xD;
was an honest youth, and Hester knew&#xD;
him well.&#xD;
".My goad lad," said a ,man who,&#xD;
wrapped in agreat coat,:walkedupto&#xD;
him immediately that ,ester had.van-&#xD;
ished .into the house, "can you tell me&#xD;
where Hollybush-alley is ?"&#xD;

HESTER S OMERS-E=T.&#xD;
&#xD;
The boy looked puzzled, for he did&#xD;
- not know of such a place.&#xD;
"Holybush-alley, sir? Take care,&#xD;
sir; this is a painting I've got here';&#xD;
don't knock against it, please."&#xD;
"I won't hurt it, my dear youth.&#xD;
Here's twopence for you, if you'll just&#xD;
tell me where Hollybush-alley is."&#xD;
One hand of the boy, as he took the&#xD;
money, was    necessarily withdrawn'&#xD;
from  the picture-frame ; and a very&#xD;
slight knock which the man gave, as if&#xD;
by accident in turning around, caused&#xD;
the painting. to "fall, from the lad's&#xD;
shoulder upon the pavement.&#xD;
" Oh! whatwill the lady say ?" cried&#xD;
the boy, in great consternation.&#xD;
"I'm very sorry, but it is not injur-&#xD;
ed," sa : the man; "the wrapper has&#xD;
saved.it; the picture is not even soiled.&#xD;
Now let me place it on your shoulder."&#xD;
"Quick, then: .for miss will be here&#xD;
in a minute," exclaimed the trembling&#xD;
youth.&#xD;
* As the stranger lifted the picture,&#xD;
and .the boy :turned from  him, the&#xD;
former.might have been observed to&#xD;
draw hastily fromhis large side-pocket&#xD;
a. common painter's brush, smeared&#xD;
with black paint.. What his object&#xD;
might be himself only knew : and why&#xD;
he lifted the cloth covering, thrusting&#xD;
his arm beneath.it at the very moment&#xD;
he was settling the -picture in the de-&#xD;
sired position, was equally a mystery.&#xD;
"It is all right," said the man. "I&#xD;
won't trouble you any more about 1ol7&#xD;
lybush-alley, for I think I know it now.&#xD;
There, you may keep the twopence ;"&#xD;
and the speaker, who in truth had not&#xD;
expected this golden opportunity of ac-&#xD;
complishing so easily what he meditat-&#xD;
ed, vanished around the'corner, just as&#xD;
Bester came, up, out of breath with&#xD;
climbing and descending the countless&#xD;
stairs of the high lodging-houses. The&#xD;
'boy'did not mention the incident-which&#xD;
had occurred, since no damage seemed'&#xD;
to have been done. They reached -the'&#xD;
prison:;°and the picture having been&#xD;
carried to the room of Mr..Somerset,&#xD;
the lad went away.&#xD;
The "father and the daughter stood.&#xD;
before the painting, as it leant, conceal-&#xD;
edby its -overagainst the wall.  .&#xD;
Somerset was, anxious to- see it;but&#xD;
Histe- repressed his ardor, and would&#xD;
2not,' for  a.few minutes, perrnit lim to&#xD;
'raise the Canvas.&#xD;
M4[Now, you expect too much," she&#xD;
said. "KBrookland Ball and the coun-&#xD;
&#xD;
try around, we know, are very beauti-&#xD;
ful"--the old gentleman sighed-" but&#xD;
I have not done justice to the subject,&#xD;
although this piece has occupied me&#xD;
exactly six weeks."&#xD;
" Six weeks, my poor child, laboring&#xD;
for me I" eaid Mr. Somerset.&#xD;
"But for myself, too, father," ob-&#xD;
served Hester, smiling.&#xD;
"Well, I trust you will receive a&#xD;
due reward for your toil. Perseverance&#xD;
is a noble virtue. It will sell-it mut&#xD;
sell-yet I shall grieve to lose it.- Now,&#xD;
Hester, gratify me."&#xD;
The girl playfully put back the in-&#xD;
truding hand.&#xD;
" One instant stop, dear father. Let&#xD;
me open the door, that more light may&#xD;
fall upon it. Much 'of the effect of a&#xD;
picture, you know, depends upon the&#xD;
light in which it is placed."-&#xD;
Hester moved 'back the door, and&#xD;
drew aside the little curtain which&#xD;
hung over the single ,window., Then,&#xD;
with a girlish pleasure and an artist's&#xD;
pride, she stooped to raise thecanvas&#xD;
which covered the fair representation&#xD;
of Brookland Hall. Already,in fancy,&#xD;
the late .-proprietor- saw his beloved&#xD;
Elizabethan mansion, the smooth velvet&#xD;
park, the fresh green trees, the deer, the&#xD;
running brook, the hills,-and the dis-&#xD;
tant sea. He half-shaded his eyes with&#xD;
his. hands, until 'e t delightful.vision&#xD;
should be realized to his senses. But&#xD;
his daughter, suddenly started'back,&#xD;
and a shriek sprang -to.her lips. She&#xD;
tottered towards him, unable-to:articu-&#xD;
late words ; but her hand was pointed&#xD;
in the.direction of the uncovered paint-&#xD;
ing&#xD;
Oh, that piteous, agonizing look! It&#xD;
sent a thrill to the father's heart. And&#xD;
there was the performance-not a beau-&#xD;
tiful landscape now ; but on the fairy-&#xD;
like colors stood large daubs of black&#xD;
paint.  The blue, delicate sky, the&#xD;
greendfelds, the ancient mansion, were&#xD;
crossed and-recrossed by-broad belts&#xD;
and smears" of;thea'same obliterating&#xD;
paint. The ruin had been done quick'.&#xD;
ly, but done eompl4tely.&#xD;
The pale fae of=Hester layon her&#xD;
father's shoulder; and tears, relieving&#xD;
the first shock and the .agonyt "were&#xD;
flowingnow."M. Somerset saw all,&#xD;
and understgod at brce lher feelings.&#xD;
None bat anemy cold'r have perspe-&#xD;
trated the infamrous act ; and who that&#xD;
enemy was he had little diffienltyiin&#xD;

drooping 'child, whosehopes wer&#xD;
crushed; and whose labors were all i&#xD;

dignation.-Another injury was heape&#xD;
on his head; another stabihad been in&#xD;
stigated by the cruel 'brother ! , Wil&#xD;
the law give him no . redress? Wil&#xD;

resources, without 'a single pound&#xD;
Who would engage attorneys ? ---wh&#xD;
fee counsel for him? ie must bear it&#xD;
patience-his destiny was tosuffer.&#xD;
The injured man turned slowly, fo:&#xD;
he heard a step approach the door. -.A&#xD;
figure now darkened the entrance, thi&#xD;
figure of a person-well known. Th&#xD;
intruder stood still, with his arms&#xD;
'quietly folded. This was not the first&#xD;
time he had made his appearance in'a&#xD;
-similar manner. Roland-Hartley came&#xD;
to indulge in the luxury of certain&#xD;
feelings, and tb behold the humiliation&#xD;
-of hisenemy. The lids were half raised&#xD;
from his; glowing eyes, and the pupils&#xD;
dilated with singular expression-of&#xD;
malicious enjoyment.&#xD;
-The two brothers gazed on each other,&#xD;
.:strange to say, -without uttering a&#xD;
single word. Their 'looks seemed to&#xD;
lascinate each other by some deadly&#xD;
influence, and theyedid not advance a&#xD;
step or move a limb.;- Hester 'only&#xD;
cowered away, sinking gradually from&#xD;
her father's embrace, until-her fair form&#xD;
half lay upon the floor, one hand-being&#xD;
tremulously extended towards him who&#xD;
stood at the entrance, as if she would&#xD;
entreat his forbearance and-mercy.&#xD;

Hartley at first was surprised, but&#xD;
presently, comprehending the truth,&#xD;
laughed, if that hideous writhing of the&#xD;
I hard features might be called laughter.&#xD;
" I am not guilty,, Hugh. I did not&#xD;
f besmear that fair picture. I faith!&#xD;

- "-You- employed, then, some villain&#xD;

" If so, brother, mind:it is your place&#xD;
to discover- the instrument, and then&#xD;
prove me to be the employer. The law&#xD;
does not call on me to assist you in the&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
I need no assistance. Your tool,&#xD;

"Very well;.proceed against us; we&#xD;
are ready to :appear. In the Temple,&#xD;
and at St. Mary-Axe, you will 'always&#xD;

him, and added, " Snug quarters-&#xD;

walls--cool, pleasant in the summer,&#xD;
exceedingly so; but--winter is coming&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hollybush-alley, now first told to her,&#xD;
sufliciently explained the truth,; the&#xD;
description, too, given by the boy of&#xD;
the stranger's appearance---though his&#xD;
face had been muffled up in an old great&#xD;
coat-convinced her that the person&#xD;
was Pike. Urged by her father, she&#xD;
consulted a magistrate, who, consider-&#xD;
ing the case, requested Mr. Pike's&#xD;
presence at the office. So plausible,&#xD;
however, were that gentleman's state-&#xD;
ments, so mild his manner, and sound&#xD;
his arguments, that the.magistrate soon&#xD;
became convinced Mr. Pike could not&#xD;
have been the ,man who accosted the&#xD;
lad and destroyed the painting.&#xD;
"Alas 1" said the worthy attorney,&#xD;
" we gentlemen of the law, your wor-&#xD;
ship, are frequently placed in a very&#xD;
unenviable position,. being -considered&#xD;
enemies when, in reality, we are friends.&#xD;
This young woman's father has the&#xD;
misfortune to be in prison, having run&#xD;
through all his property by means of&#xD;
unsuccessful:speculations. I was em-&#xD;
ployed on behalf of one of the creditors,&#xD;
and was compelled,/in carrying out the&#xD;
law,. to be , the reluctant instrument&#xD;
of causing his 'present -confinement.&#xD;
Hence it is that the good, innocent,&#xD;
and affectionate daughter, mourning&#xD;
her father's condition, regards me as a&#xD;
bitter enemy. Everything that goes&#xD;
amiss she ascribes to me. All the ills&#xD;
she endures are traced to my agency,&#xD;
as'if I could have any motive or pleasure&#xD;
inpersenuting a poor.defenceless girl.&#xD;
Alas t I wish.I could convince her that&#xD;
I pity both herself and her father, and&#xD;
would assist them to the utmost of my&#xD;
ability."&#xD;
Mr. Pike smoothed down the tufts of&#xD;
his red hair, drooped his little watery&#xD;
eyes. and looked the picture of candor&#xD;
and benevolence.&#xD;
"Wretched, hypocritical man!" cried&#xD;
flester, her cheek-flushing with honest&#xD;
anger; "you well know that all you&#xD;
now assert is a tissue of falsehoods.&#xD;
our malignant, your fiendish nature&#xD;
"{hush, girl, if ou please.t" said the&#xD;
. magistrate, frowning ;." these  hard&#xD;
words must notbe used, in my presence,&#xD;
against a respectable attorney. I make&#xD;
very; allowance for the -state of your'&#xD;
feelings, and can well imagine why&#xD;
you consider Mr. Pike an enemy, when,&#xD;
,as he :justly observes, he .is no such&#xD;
thing. le is an attorney, miss, and&#xD;
austat in conformity with the law,&#xD;
&#xD;
109&#xD;
&#xD;
and consult the will of his clients. - The&#xD;
lad is unable to swear that the man in&#xD;
the great coat, who encountered him in&#xD;
Fleet-lane, is this gentleman ; no proof,&#xD;
therefore, exists of the identity of the&#xD;
two individuals. The case, consequent-&#xD;
ly, must be, dismissed. Mr. Pike," I&#xD;
have no further question to ask; you&#xD;
may leave. Now, hush, young lady;&#xD;
don't utter another word.; the question&#xD;
is decided. What! you will speak !-&#xD;
you ,brave my authority, do you?&#xD;
Fang," said the worthy magistrate,&#xD;
turning to, one -of the functionaries,&#xD;
"you had better lead her out of the&#xD;
court."&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
HESTER ENTERS A NEW FIELD OF EMPLOY-&#xD;
MENT.-THE AVOWAL OF LOVE.&#xD;
HESTER was alone in her room, pon-&#xD;
dering on past events.  During the&#xD;
time she had been painting, nearly all&#xD;
the money previously saved by her had&#xD;
been expended. Illsuccess as an artist,&#xD;
and her late terrible misfortune, caused&#xD;
herinexpressible grief, and for the time&#xD;
crushed her spirit. Moreover, she be-&#xD;
gan .to doubt her ability to produce,&#xD;
pictures sufficiently meritorious to com-&#xD;
mand a sale, so as. to be a source of&#xD;
remuneration. Fame she did not covet;&#xD;
the possession of the sum  of money&#xD;
necessary to effect the liberation of-her&#xD;
father being all her heart desired. Her&#xD;
brushes and her palette, then, were&#xD;
thrown aside; she would paint no more.&#xD;
In a word, Hester abandoned the idea'&#xD;
of prosecuting an art which, circum-&#xD;
stanced as she was, held out no hope.&#xD;
A tap at her door disturbed the train&#xD;
of her thoughts, and the blind woman,&#xD;
Mrs. Flemming, crept into the room.&#xD;
"I have heard of the great' wicked-.&#xD;
ness of some persons unknown," she&#xD;
began, "who have destroyed your paint-&#xD;
ing ; ;but I am not come to -speak of&#xD;
=that ; I bring.a message from my son."&#xD;
"From Mr. Flemming?"said Hester,&#xD;
in a tone of surprise.&#xD;
"If you. would let -him have the&#xD;
honor of stepping ug for five minutes,&#xD;
he-thinks &amp;amp;could inform you of some-&#xD;
thing, or advise  something, which&#xD;
:might be to your advantage.",&#xD;
"Certainly he may come,.Mrs. Flem-&#xD;
ming. You will accompany him."&#xD;

&#xD;
-When- the hunchback entered the&#xD;
room, with his slender spindle legs,&#xD;
long arms, and stooping head, the,&#xD;
hunch being seen like a small hill be-&#xD;
hind;it, the object he presented might&#xD;
be-pitiable; yet, unlike some misshapen&#xD;
uulfortunates or monsters, his appear-&#xD;
ance, did not excite disgust or fear.&#xD;
Gazing only at his countenance, you&#xD;
were interested by -its highly intellec-&#xD;
tual expression, while the quiet melan-&#xD;
choly which softened every feature&#xD;
touched the heart. His thin face now&#xD;
glowed, and his eyes were lit up, but&#xD;
his limbs trembled ; and, as he looked at&#xD;
Hester, the agitation he betrayed every&#xD;
moment increased.&#xD;
The blind woman stood by the side&#xD;
of her son, proud of her ofspring-the&#xD;
child of deformitybutof genius. Hester&#xD;
had only one chair; she drew it to Mrs.&#xD;
Flemming, and the latter seated herself.&#xD;
""Now, Mark, tell'the lady what you&#xD;
think about the music."&#xD;
The hunchback, being thus brought&#xD;
face to face with her he secretly adored,&#xD;
suffered some moments to elapse before&#xD;
he- could summon courage to address&#xD;
her."' At length he spoke:-,&#xD;
"I am not ignorant, Miss Somerset,&#xD;
of the great design you cherish with-&#xD;
respect to your father.  Would we&#xD;
were able to assist you; but I can only&#xD;
offer my poor advice. I am told you,&#xD;
play the -piano, and that you under-&#xD;
stand music well. Why, then, devote&#xD;
your time to the thankless unprofitable&#xD;
employment of drawing?-an employ-&#xD;
muent by which one 'gains a living and&#xD;
twenty starve."&#xD;
"But I have no piano -now; mine&#xD;
was sold with my father's furniture,&#xD;
and I have not sufficient money to buy&#xD;
another." .&#xD;
- "No matter ; obtain the few neces-&#xD;
sary music-books, and you can give&#xD;
lessons to 'young ladies in families.&#xD;
supplied with instruments."&#xD;
'Yes,". said the blind- woman ;&#xD;
"thergis nothing easier or more com-&#xD;
mon than, for teachers to attend at the&#xD;
parents' houses. -Much money may be&#xD;
made thatsway, depend on it."'&#xD;
Hester was. thoughtful, but; she did&#xD;
not long hesitate in expressing her&#xD;
opinion; Gifted with 'an ardent and&#xD;
hopeful spirit, she, was one easily to be&#xD;
illed&amp;amp; with bright dreams." In truth,&#xD;
Flemming's-scheme 'seemed -to her -a.&#xD;
very happy one, and she thanked  him&#xD;
for his- suggestions,-and would imme-&#xD;
&#xD;
diately use he best endeavors to profit&#xD;
by his advice.&#xD;
The next, day an advertisement&#xD;
appeared in one of the morning papers,&#xD;
setting forth Hester's intention ofteach-&#xD;
ing the rudiments of music in private&#xD;
families, her terns being unusually&#xD;
moderate. This appeal was not 'attend-&#xD;
ed- with much success. Two'.pupils,&#xD;
however, were gained; and the beauty&#xD;
of Hester, her-gentle manners, and her&#xD;
fine natural talents, were soon appreci-&#xD;
ated. The parents of the two children&#xD;
she taught recommended her to others,&#xD;
and thus she progressed, the circle of&#xD;
her labors gradually enlarging, and her&#xD;
gains consequently increasing..&#xD;
We see her, then, after her usual call&#xD;
at the Fleet Prison-for never yet had&#xD;
she passed one day without visiting her&#xD;
father-hurrying forth to the different&#xD;
houses where she gave music lessons,&#xD;
Her step was light, and her heart was&#xD;
happy. She pleased, for with her the&#xD;
art of pleasing was a natural, and not&#xD;
an acquired talent. Her pupils might&#xD;
be dull, but her patience triumphed&#xD;
over their stolidity ; some of the mo-&#xD;
thers might be coarse and overbearing,&#xD;
but Hester's humility and unvarying&#xD;
good-humor disarmed and"conciliated&#xD;
even them.&#xD;
Three months from-the commencement&#xD;
of this career, Hester, for the first time,&#xD;
proceeded to a certain old and sub-&#xD;
stantial-looking house in the Strand-&#xD;
it was a savings' bank. The indefati-&#xD;
gable daughter of'the imprisoned ian&#xD;
deposited there, towards her great de-&#xD;
sign, the sum of thirty pounds!&#xD;
But we must now relate an inci-&#xD;
dent which much affected her peace of&#xD;
mind, and' subsequently led to a scene&#xD;
that well, might terrify a young gi'ri,&#xD;
alone and unprotected 'in the great&#xD;
world of -London. -Mark Flemming,&#xD;
the hunchback, heard of Hester's suc-&#xD;
cess, and rejoiced at it. The unfortu-&#xD;
nate and apparently hopeless ,passion&#xD;
which he had conceived for her had by&#xD;
no means lessened in its intensity.&#xD;
Still his love was of the most" timid&#xD;
and reserved description. His-actions&#xD;
might have betrayed:his secret, buthie&#xD;
lips were mute. The hour, however,&#xD;
was coming which must decide his fate,&#xD;
for' he felt ,it impossible to maintain&#xD;
silence much longer. He struggled day&#xD;
after day to imprison the whirlwind in&#xD;
his heart until that heart was bursting.&#xD;
Nature! with all thy running skill,&#xD;

and harmonious adaptation of part to.&#xD;
part through creation's, range, dost&#xD;
thou not sometimes commit melancholy&#xD;
errors ? How else should we find a&#xD;
spirit like Flemming's imprisoned in&#xD;
such a body? His deformity was not&#xD;
the result of an accident, for so he had&#xD;
come into the world.  Listless had&#xD;
Flernmming grown in prosecuting his&#xD;
musical studies ; :his violin, once so&#xD;
worshipped,,his second self, was cast&#xD;
aside, or only played on when necessity&#xD;
compelled; his new passion usurped&#xD;
the place of all other affections of the&#xD;
mind and heart.&#xD;
The hunchback was standing in his&#xD;
room, being too restless. and feverish&#xD;
to-sit; for he had come to a resolution&#xD;
that dayof1dressing  Hester. She&#xD;
was - alen , giving one of her music&#xD;
lessons, but he expected her every min-&#xD;
ute. His motherwas asleep in her ac-&#xD;
customed corner, a circumstance which&#xD;
favored his design. -Flemming, anxious&#xD;
not to disturb her, crept to and fro on&#xD;
tiptoe. The poor young    man had&#xD;
dressed himself for the occasion with&#xD;
great attention and care; his long locks&#xD;
had been ,combed, his linen changed,&#xD;
and his threadbare coat scrupulously&#xD;
brushed. _ What mnad fancy entered his&#xD;
soul? What mocking demon whispered&#xD;
in his ear, that woman could love, could&#xD;
accept a being like him ?&#xD;
Flemming gazed from   his window&#xD;
into the squalid street, but Hester was&#xD;
not to be seen. Oh ! that, she would,&#xD;
hasten and relieve his suspense ! for,&#xD;
having now formed his resolve, the tor-&#xD;
ture of'that uncertainty was terrible to&#xD;
endure. A quarter of an hour passed&#xD;
-a .few minutes more--still his eyes&#xD;
were- riveted on the pavement below.&#xD;
9isrestlessness andagitation increased.&#xD;
Suddenly he stepped back from   the&#xD;
window; he perceived her at last.&#xD;
Hester was come.&#xD;
'She was sitting in her chair; her hat&#xD;
lay on the floor, and her shawl had fall.&#xD;
enbehind her; except this, her dress&#xD;
'Was notdisarranged; but her hair, hav-&#xD;
ing: escaped fom its comb ,fell in wave-&#xD;
like and glittering'-masses; rather than&#xD;
ringlets, down her shoulders.'She&#xD;
looked inexpressibly 'heatiful,:yet nei-&#xD;
ther ,blushing. timidity nor anger was&#xD;
apparent in _her face;:pit bore.only' the&#xD;
stamp of sorrow. Her cheek was pale,&#xD;
and the long fringe of the lids, as-her,&#xD;
eyes were cast on the floor, sustained&#xD;
&#xD;
tears, which, one by one, fell into .her&#xD;
lap. She- did not move or speak, for'&#xD;
the thoughts which oppressed her heart&#xD;
admitted not of utterance.&#xD;
Fleminingremained at a short dis-&#xD;
tance : his attitude half stdoping, half&#xD;
kneeling, betokened supplication.- His&#xD;
thin hands were clasped before him;'&#xD;
the colow on his usually ashy cheek-&#xD;
fluctuated every moment ; and his&#xD;
breathing was hard and hurried. His&#xD;
secret, then, had -been revealed ; he&#xD;
had declared his love for Hester-the&#xD;
passion which half paralyzed his facul-&#xD;
ties,- and -daily and hourly consumed&#xD;
him. He felt by ono means confident of&#xD;
success, yet, in spite of all he knew, in&#xD;
spite of the consciousness of the blight&#xD;
and curse fallen on his miserable body,&#xD;
the poor hunchback was not entirely&#xD;
without hope.-&#xD;
"You are alarmed-you shrink from&#xD;
me," said Flemming,'stealing an ardent&#xD;
glance at Hester. " I am award that&#xD;
to an ordinary woman I must be an&#xD;
objectof contempt; perhaps of loathing;&#xD;
but the belief that you possess a high&#xD;
soul, endowed' with genius, has -em-&#xD;
boldened me to address you. Oh! re-&#xD;
gard me not as I appear ! Let our love&#xD;
be of the immortal spirit! letour union&#xD;
be a union of souls!".&#xD;
Alas ! Hester was still flesh and blood,&#xD;
and had not conquered the instincts of&#xD;
humanity. She had not become an&#xD;
idealist, capable of living out of matter,&#xD;
or soaring above it. Her hopes, her.&#xD;
fears, her joys, were still associated&#xD;
with things of earth, and her whole&#xD;
nature was tremblingly alive to the&#xD;
beautiful.&#xD;
" You do not speak !" pursued Flem-&#xD;
ming. " Perhaps you condder my&#xD;
station in life below your own; and it&#xD;
is, I am conscious, of it, notwithstand-&#xD;
ing all the circumstances of distress&#xD;
which now surround you."&#xD;
" No,"  answered  Hester, softly,&#xD;
"'What have I to do with pride? 'iny&#xD;
father and myself cannot be reduced&#xD;
more low."     a&#xD;
Flemming's eyes brightened, forehe&#xD;
felt encouraged, anddrawing a step&#xD;
nearer, he spoke Tapidly and 'with vehe-&#xD;
mence:-&#xD;
"If to watch around you, to obey&#xD;
your slightest command, to love you&#xD;
respectfully but ardently,-to-be a pro-&#xD;
tector while' asubmissive-slave, to join.&#xD;
my: efforts with your own in- raising&#xD;
that money which shall setgdur father&#xD;
&#xD;
H:E S T-ER, SOMERSET.,&#xD;
&#xD;
at liberty; to appreciate your high men-&#xD;
tal gifts as well as your beauty, to cen-&#xD;
tre all my hopes, mayjoys,- my-life, in&#xD;
your own welfare and happiness, and&#xD;
to consider even fame and the 'world's&#xD;
applause second to your love--if all&#xD;
this may-entitle me to your attention,,&#xD;
your regard, hear me ! I beseech you,&#xD;
hear me 1"&#xD;
The arms of Flemming were raised&#xD;
imploringly, and, as he knelt on the!&#xD;
-floor, his head was thrown backward :&#xD;
his features at the moment looked&#xD;
strikingly fine, but behind was the&#xD;
disfiguring hump on the_- summit of&#xD;
his crooked back. Could the young&#xD;
fair flower; ;the bright-eyed Peri, the&#xD;
Psyche without her butterfly wings, be&#xD;
linked to aa, being like this? Our&#xD;
human feelings recoil at such a union..&#xD;
We overlook the- soul which animates&#xD;
the formless clod. We cannot help our&#xD;
sensations: we obey but the laws of&#xD;
our nature.&#xD;
Rester, who had long struggled to&#xD;
repress what she felt, spoke at length,&#xD;
but with mildness,'carefully abstaining&#xD;
from=,very allusion that might pain the&#xD;
unfortunate man.&#xD;
"I am very young, Mr. Flemming,&#xD;
very unprotected, and possess little ex-&#xD;
perience of the world. Situated as I&#xD;
am,:and laboring for my father, I can-&#xD;
-not accept-it is utterly impossible for&#xD;
me to accept--that is, I mean I cannot&#xD;
listen to your proposals."&#xD;
"Well, I may hope-some future&#xD;
time-     You do not decidedly reject&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"It would be wrong in me, to lead&#xD;
you astray. I feel it my duty to speak&#xD;
plainly. I admire your genius, your&#xD;
noble mind, and your filial affection in&#xD;
supporting  your blind  mother.  I&#xD;
will esteem you as a friend-as a bro-&#xD;
ther-"&#xD;
While she spoke these words, Flem-&#xD;
muing's agitation was pitiable to wit-&#xD;
uess: his projecting breast heaved&#xD;
-with rapid :convulsions, his muscles&#xD;
worked, and over the swollen veins of&#xD;
his, forehead spread a moisture-which-&#xD;
gradually gathered into beads.-&#xD;
"A friend-a brother !" he gasped.&#xD;
"Go on!"&#xD;
But never can I regard you in any&#xD;
other-light.*'&#xD;
".Then I hear myfate-! Heaven sup-&#xD;
port me Lthe dream is.over 1"_&#xD;
'He moved back, a few -steps, and&#xD;
leanedonthetable..As hestooped his&#xD;
&#xD;
111&#xD;
&#xD;
head on his long a'mshis face was uhh-&#xD;
seen. That attitude, although it gave&#xD;
more grotesqueneseto his misshapen&#xD;
frame, indicated the last degree-of suf-&#xD;
fering and prostration ofsoul.&#xD;
Hester could not see him thus mise-&#xD;
rable and broken down without being&#xD;
sensibly affected. Her young heart&#xD;
bled,-and the very fact of his hideous&#xD;
deformity operated as an appeal to her&#xD;
commiseration.  Drawing her chair&#xD;
towards him, she placed him gently&#xD;
into it, for he yielded passively to her&#xD;
guidance.&#xD;
"Mr. Flemming," said Hester, in&#xD;
her low, silvery accents, "be calmn. I&#xD;
am utterly unworthy of this regard-&#xD;
this grief. -You must not be angry&#xD;
with me : I have said only what duty&#xD;
compels, and the respect I have for you&#xD;
renders necessary."&#xD;
"Duty, respect !" said Flemming,&#xD;
bitterly ; "-these are words I would&#xD;
-not have you utter ; yet why should I&#xD;
find fault with them? Love, hopeless&#xD;
or happy, you have never known, and&#xD;
if it must bring torture like mine, may&#xD;
you ever be a stranger to it1"&#xD;
Heater was silently meditating. Her&#xD;
absent manner betokened that her&#xD;
thoughts wandered away from the un-&#xD;
happy man before her, and the room&#xD;
in which she stood. . Flemming ob-&#xD;
served her averted countenance and&#xD;
her thoughtfully-fixed eyes.  He ad-&#xD;
dressed her by her name, and she&#xD;
turned abruptly.&#xD;
"You said I had never.loved,"whis-&#xD;
pered Hester, her voice quivering with&#xD;
emotion.&#xD;
"Because one so young as you, so&#xD;
beautiful and pure as you, would never&#xD;
have met with a fitting object."  The&#xD;
hunchback suddenly raised hie hands:&#xD;
"Dotard ! presumptuous wretch that&#xD;
I am! and did I, in my madness,&#xD;
dream that I was a 'fitting' object?&#xD;
I, on whom rest the curse of nature&#xD;
and the ban of God.. Could a-seraph of&#xD;
light like thee love a demon?2 a foul&#xD;
hideous thing whom   a veil, should&#xD;
enwrap, whom the earth should co-&#xD;
ver ?"&#xD;
A peal of laughter, the spirit's bitter&#xD;
mockery, rang through the room. Hes-&#xD;
ter shuddered:&#xD;
"But. I will be calm, dear Miss&#xD;
,Somerset ; I will not distress you. I&#xD;
will bow to my destiny. I will endure&#xD;
my lot.. But tell me,have you indeed&#xD;
met -with one whrom you can regard&#xD;

with-those feelings you can never en-&#xD;
tertain for me:?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Hester, frankly ; "and&#xD;
this, beyond any other circumstance,-&#xD;
shouldexplain why Icannot listen ,to&#xD;
the addresses of another; your up-&#xD;
right mind must allow that falsehood,&#xD;
is a black crime."&#xD;
" It is," observed Flemming, mourn-&#xD;
fully.  -&#xD;
"From - childhood I have been,&#xD;
pledged to one who is now---"&#xD;
"Do not hesitate. Think not in my&#xD;
misery I shall utter maledictions. My&#xD;
prayer :will be, 'Heaven bless you, and&#xD;
bless him1'&#xD;
"One who is now in a distant- coun-&#xD;
try-the East Indies."x&#xD;
" A great officer,, perhaps ?"&#xD;
" No ; he is a poor lad, a peasant's&#xD;
son, self-taught-without money and&#xD;
without friends."&#xD;
Flemming was eagerly attentive, but&#xD;
evidently surprised.&#xD;
"As you cherish an intense love for&#xD;
music, so did he conceive a passion for,&#xD;
military life." -&#xD;
"You hear from him frequently?"&#xD;
"No; he is ignorant of the calamity&#xD;
that has befallen my father, and if he,&#xD;
writes, his letters do not reach us&#xD;
now."&#xD;
" Then he may have died of one of the&#xD;
diseases of the climate-he may havel&#xD;
been killed in battle."&#xD;
"God grant otherwise !" exclaimed&#xD;
Hester, her quiet, sorrowful face grow-&#xD;
ing-more pale.&#xD;
" Or," suggested Flemming, " he -&#xD;
may have altogether forsaken you."&#xD;
"That is: probable, very probable,"&#xD;
answered Hester, her eyes filling with&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"Should this be true, can you not,&#xD;
in turn, renounce him ?"&#xD;
The girl's features became animated,&#xD;
her hands were clasped, and her eyes&#xD;
raised.&#xD;
" Renounce him,!- woman's heart&#xD;
does not so soon forget; we cannot soi&#xD;
readily-obliterate impressions of early&#xD;
years.F Never, even- though he desert&#xD;
me, can I be false to him-never can l&#xD;
I cease to cherish hismemory."&#xD;
The ardor evinced byHester carried&#xD;
a conviction to the heart of Flem--&#xD;
ming that she spoke the-truth. The o&#xD;
knowledge that her affections were'&#xD;
placed .on another did not .cool his&#xD;
own passion, butAit gaveS this feel-a&#xD;
ixgs a harshness and a bitterness they&#xD;
&#xD;
did not before possess:; he was neither,&#xD;
tranquillized nor satisfied, but in. his,&#xD;
bosom the evil- principle began to war&#xD;
with. the ;good; and-this struggle was&#xD;
doomed thenceforth to divide his being,,&#xD;
now prompting him to acts of gene-&#xD;
rosity, -and now leading him to crime.&#xD;
Flemming did. not take a formal&#xD;
leave of Hester, or endeavor to excite&#xD;
her sympathy by dwelling on his own&#xD;
hopelessness and suffering. Pride as-&#xD;
sisted him now in smothering all that&#xD;
burned within, and he quitted her&#xD;
presence, apparently resigned to inevi-&#xD;
table circumstances, and the defeat of&#xD;
his pretensions.&#xD;
The heart.of Hester rejoiced at the&#xD;
mastery which Flemming seemed -to&#xD;
have gained over himself.. She beheld,,&#xD;
the sunlight restored to the surface- of&#xD;
the smooth stream, yet her eye could&#xD;
not penetrate into the dark and trou-&#xD;
bled waters beneath.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.        Y&#xD;
THE VISITING MEMBER Or THE "RAUD-&#xD;
PREVENTING SOcIETY."&#xD;
HESTER's success, as a teacher of&#xD;
music, exceeded her expectations and-&#xD;
her prospects daily grew more bright.&#xD;
The monotony of Mr. Somerset's. ex-&#xD;
istence was relieved and cheered by the&#xD;
assurance of his child's=welfare. That&#xD;
she would ever,-by any exertions, al-&#xD;
though extending through a series of&#xD;
years, savesufficient to procure his re-&#xD;
lease, he held to be a chimera and a&#xD;
dream; yet he did not discourage her;&#xD;
in the prosecution of her design,-for&#xD;
whatever money-might be accumulated&#xD;
would be her own, when death should-&#xD;
put an end to his trials, and hischild,&#xD;
be thrown without a protector on the&#xD;
world. Nevertheless, he was surprised&#xD;
when Hester informed him how much,,&#xD;
in so short a period, she hadlaid by.-&#xD;
Her progress, too, was- a sufficient&#xD;
prdi6f how: greatly she was esteemed&#xD;
by the families into which she-had the.&#xD;
good fortune to=obtain an introduction.&#xD;
Meantime, we must not imagine the-&#xD;
venom of Hartley's hatred was staydd,-&#xD;
or that' Mr. Pike had fallenasleep;=&#xD;
The, latter. had  made-limselfac-&#xD;
quainted with the fact that- Hester-&#xD;
had; deposited a sum of anoneyina&#xD;
avings:' bank. -Thei information was&#xD;
&#xD;
HES-TER S O MERSTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
duly communicated- to the revengeful&#xD;
Hartley, and .caused him great irrita-&#xD;
tion and rage. The: two consulted to-&#xD;
gether, and the happy scheme which&#xD;
they concocted for.defeating their puny'&#xD;
enemy will presently appear.&#xD;
Day after day,.the indefatigable at-&#xD;
torney dogged at a distance the steps&#xD;
of Hester; when he saw her enter a&#xD;
house, he would with his pencil quietly-&#xD;
mark down the address. This course&#xD;
was persevered in for a week, until the&#xD;
respective places at which Hester called&#xD;
amounted to twenty-a number, he had&#xD;
reason to believe, including the entire&#xD;
round of her musical engagements.&#xD;
It was about five o'clock, just after&#xD;
the family; dinner, that a gentleman&#xD;
knocked at the door of a house in the&#xD;
neighborhood of Bedford-row. His ap-&#xD;
pearance was that of a clergyman, for&#xD;
he was dressed. in black, with a stiff&#xD;
white neckerchief,. shovel hat, and&#xD;
black silk stockings. His look was&#xD;
very respectable and very sedate, al-&#xD;
though he might not have been called&#xD;
a personable man, so broad was his thin-&#xD;
liplessamouth, so small and round were&#xD;
his twinkling eyes, and so fiat in the&#xD;
front his receding skull.&#xD;
"is the lady of the house at home?"&#xD;
asked the stranger.&#xD;
The servant girl said that she was,&#xD;
and inquired the gentleman's name.,&#xD;
"'The Reverend Mr..Smith. I have-&#xD;
business, my girl, which interests your&#xD;
mistress"&#xD;
The-reverend gentleman was accord-&#xD;
 ingly introduced into the little parlor,&#xD;
for the owner of the house was not a&#xD;
wealthy, though a respectable trades-&#xD;
man. Mrs. Greatheart (such was the&#xD;
female's name) presently- appeared,&#xD;
and courtesied to the visitor with that&#xD;
respect: in her manner which his walk&#xD;
inSlife seemed to demand,&#xD;
"Madam," began the, Reverend Mr.&#xD;
Smith, "my visit is one of philanthropy&#xD;
-no, no," he quickly added, perceiving&#xD;
'the lady look grave, and press her hands,&#xD;
to her sides, as if forming a strong de-&#xD;
termination not: to introducethem-into.&#xD;
her pockets-"I4do not call to beg for,&#xD;
any charity-I do not go about:collect&#xD;
ing money for the building of churches&#xD;
-oh, no-; my object is to do you,&#xD;
madam,. a personal service."&#xD;
Mrs. Greatheart, at this assurance,&#xD;
was immediately all smiles,; and seated&#xD;
herself opposite to Mr..Smith:.Alasli&#xD;
for human nature  so widely different,&#xD;
&#xD;
11$&#xD;
&#xD;
are the sentiments we experience,- wben&#xD;
our own individual intests°are eon}&#xD;
cerned, and those of-the' great family&#xD;
of mankind!is  &#xD;
" I amn a.member, madam,;of a'iso&#xD;
ciety whose object is to prevent fraud&#xD;
being practised on innocent and unsus-&#xD;
pecting families. We, the members&#xD;
take it in turn to visit allhouses where&#xD;
we suspect or fear evil designs are&#xD;
meditated."&#xD;
" An excellent society, truly; but,;&#xD;
bless me ! I hope no wicked persons&#xD;
are plotting evil against us."&#xD;
The. gentleman in black shookhis&#xD;
head, which shake seemed to intimate&#xD;
a great deal, and, more thapi words&#xD;
perhaps would have done, excited Mrs.&#xD;
Greatheart's curiosity and alarm.&#xD;
" I trust you will not suffer any ina&#xD;
jury, madam;: however, information&#xD;
has been ,given   at the 'Society's&#xD;
Rooms'".-for we employ many officer&#xD;
in this good work-that certain- evil-'&#xD;
disposed parties have gained:occasional&#xD;
access to your house."&#xD;
"I am   astonished, sir, and: yet I&#xD;
thank  you for this - timely notice.&#xD;
Where, pray, "may your 'Society's&#xD;
Rooms' be, that I may communicate&#xD;
if necessary, with you ?"&#xD;
"Excuse me, madam, answering&#xD;
that question; we-we," added the&#xD;
reverend  gentleman, with a short&#xD;
cough-" we are compelled to-be very&#xD;
secret in our laudable exertions; ,if our&#xD;
rooms-in fact, if-the ' Fraud-Prevent-&#xD;
ing Society'-were once generally known&#xD;
to exist, we should soonibe crushed by&#xD;
a coalition of the wicked, and the- ends&#xD;
of justice and' virtue would thus be&#xD;
defeated."&#xD;
"Very well-I understand -your&#xD;
reasons are quite satisfactory. But&#xD;
pray, tell me, sir,: what suspicious&#xD;
characters visit our-house ?"&#xD;
" Fraudulent ;persons, madatm --&#xD;
thieves, madam. Our great aim isto&#xD;
save  private families from   being&#xD;
robbed.'&#xD;
"Ah! perhaps the servant-"&#xD;
" No, our officers have learnt thatshe&#xD;
is an. honest creature; but they have&#xD;
seen entering your door occasionally a&#xD;
young female, who assumes.the guise of&#xD;
a lady'"&#xD;
Mrs. Greatheart started, uttering a&#xD;
slight exclamation.&#xD;
" Thereis a gang of thieves, madam,&#xD;
just now employing young girls, edu-,&#xD;
cated for:the :purpose, to teach music&#xD;

ner-yes, it requires all the exertions&#xD;
of such societies as ours to combat&#xD;
with, and put down, the iniquity of&#xD;
the times P"&#xD;
The Reverend Mr. Smith's eyes were&#xD;
raised to the ceiling, and she sighed&#xD;
from the bottom of his philanthropic&#xD;
breast. ,&#xD;
" Sir," said Mrs. Greatheart, much&#xD;
moved, "this is, indeed, terrible, and&#xD;
yet to us housekeepers, most useful&#xD;
information. But I don't think," con-&#xD;
tinued the lady, visions of brooches&#xD;
and silver spoons flitting through her&#xD;
'brain-" I am  not quite certain we&#xD;
have lost anything yet."-&#xD;
"Very probably -not, ma'am; the&#xD;
opportunity hasn't come."&#xD;
" Of course, reverend sir, you allude&#xD;
to the young lady who teaches my&#xD;
children music ?"&#xD;
"Yes; by what 'name do you call&#xD;
her ?"&#xD;
"Miss Somerset."&#xD;
"Oh-ah !" said the wily gentleman,&#xD;
careful not to commit himself too far--&#xD;
" I don't know thatname-Miss Somer-&#xD;
set ! 'tis a pretty and an'innocent kind&#xD;
of name. The officer who traced the&#xD;
young woman here told me she is&#xD;
called Mary Sparks--the youngest lass&#xD;
employed by the gang."-&#xD;
That is strange," observed Mrs.&#xD;
Greatheart.&#xD;
" Not at all strange, madam. 'I dare&#xD;
say the unhappy female goes by a dif-&#xD;
ferent -name at every place where she&#xD;
teaches music. , Bless you I London&#xD;
thieves are the most adroit set of peo-&#xD;
ple on earth."   ',&#xD;
" But then the girl is so gentle, so&#xD;
kind to the children, so= beautiful, and&#xD;
so ladylike, that I can scarcely believe&#xD;
her guilty."  Mrs.-Greatheart said this&#xD;
in a sorrowful tone, for her' heart&#xD;
yearned secretly to Hester, and human&#xD;
nature spoke out. The Reverend Mr.&#xD;
Smith smiled; and' brushed the crown&#xD;
of his clerical hat with his coat-sleeve.&#xD;
"Madam, a a clergyman, I respect&#xD;
your sentisnents and feelings ; they be-&#xD;
speak a generous- heart; yet, believe&#xD;
&#xD;
O MER-SET.&#xD;
me, it will be wrong to.yield to such&#xD;
kind but mistaken notions. These&#xD;
young thieving-girls are taught bland,&#xD;
gentle, and insipuating manners; in&#xD;
fact, it forms a part of their education-&#xD;
and their trainig.'"&#xD;
" True," cried Mrs. Greatheart, thus&#xD;
enlightened;  'I dare say you are&#xD;
right. But, reverend sir, what shall I&#xD;
do when this Hester Somerset-----"&#xD;
" Mary-Sparks, madam."&#xD;
"This Mary Sparks calls again; shall&#xD;
I give her in charge to the police ?'&#xD;
"I think not,',answered the mem-&#xD;
ber of the Fraud-Preventing Society.&#xD;
"You say you have lost as yet no-&#xD;
plate or other valuables; therefore,&#xD;
though morally convinced that she in-&#xD;
tends theft, being employed by the&#xD;
gang, we lack proof to convict her. I&#xD;
am of, opinion, in order to save need-&#xD;
less trouble and unpleasant proceed-&#xD;
ings, you had better quietly at once&#xD;
dismiss the young woman, cautioning-&#xD;
her never again to enter your house,&#xD;
Thus your interests willbe protected,&#xD;
and the wicked deigns of the knaves&#xD;
upon a respectable family defeated."&#xD;
"I will follow .your advice,.sir,"&#xD;
said' Mrs. Greatheart; "and I most&#xD;
sincerely thank you, and the excellent&#xD;
society to whichyou belong, foryour&#xD;
timely information. Bless my soul&#xD;
what an escape I have had !     But&#xD;
won't you honor me by takingaglass&#xD;
of wine before you leave ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Greatheart brought forward the&#xD;
decanters, at the contents of which Mr.&#xD;
Smith :cast a very longing eye: he,&#xD;
however, shook his head, and mur-&#xD;
mured something about its being con-&#xD;
trary to his principles and his prac-&#xD;
tice to  indulge in vinous drinks : and&#xD;
yet, smiling benevolently, he said, on&#xD;
second thoughts, as he felt much ex-&#xD;
hausted in prosecuting the duties of&#xD;
his office, he would take one glass.&#xD;
This beingdone, the reverend function-&#xD;
ary retired to pursue his philanthropic&#xD;
way through, the streets of iniquitous&#xD;
London; while the excited Mrs. Great-&#xD;
heart -hastened to reveal:all she had&#xD;
learned to the divers members of her&#xD;
astonished family.&#xD;
-Mr. Pike having, as we have -seen,&#xD;
made himself acquainted withthe ad-&#xD;
dresses of the respective- parties in-&#xD;
whose families Hester gave her =music&#xD;
lessons~ found no-diffeulty in following&#xD;
up rapidly: his plan of action. The&#xD;
consequence was that, in two days, he&#xD;
&#xD;
HES TE"R   S1&#xD;
had-called at all the houses frequented&#xD;
by the poor piano-forte'teacher. We&#xD;
have given theabove visit as an example&#xD;
of his iode of proceeding; and since&#xD;
he carefully concealed the wheret&#xD;
about" of the Society's Chambers,,and&#xD;
had adopted the widely-spread- and'&#xD;
most blinding appellation of' Smith,"&#xD;
he ran little or'no risk of detection.  1&#xD;
Hismission being done the Reverend-&#xD;
Mr. Smith, with his white neckerchief&#xD;
and blacrsik stockiiigs; vanished'from'&#xD;
the scene, and the "'raud-Preventing&#xD;
Society" was solemnly entrenched in&#xD;
its accustomed secrecy  the terrible&#xD;
effects, as they bore on the fortunes of&#xD;
Hester, only remained..&#xD;

"Madam ! what does all this mean?&#xD;
tell me l" cried Hester, in her eager-&#xD;
ness and distress seizing the arm- of&#xD;
Mrs. Greatheart.&#xD;
"Off! girl !" exclaimed the other,&#xD;
repulsing her. " Pollute ne not with&#xD;
your touch."   But presently, half&#xD;
relenting, she added, "Poor ,child! I&#xD;
pity you nevertheless so early. to be&#xD;
led into the paths' of vice-but not you&#xD;
* so muchuas your employers are-guilty&#xD;
-that dreadful gang !"&#xD;
"A gang, madam ?"&#xD;
"Of course: thatgang; that regularly&#xD;
organized body of thieves,_those clever&#xD;
adepts at knavery who send young girls&#xD;
such as you into respectable London&#xD;
families. Your name is not Hester&#xD;
Somerset ; that is only an assumed one.&#xD;
But words are useless. The labors of&#xD;
the excellent 'Fraud-Preventing Socie-&#xD;
ty' are fast breaking up the iniquitous&#xD;
system."&#xD;
" Where is this society, that I may&#xD;
fly to them and defend my character ?"&#xD;
cried Hester, wildly.&#xD;
"I don't know," said Mrs. Great-&#xD;
heart, in a cold accent; " it is a secret."&#xD;
" Ah ! did a man-did a lawyer&#xD;
named Pike tell you this?"&#xD;
"Certainly not ; I know nothing of&#xD;
such a person ; my information was&#xD;
given me by a clergyman. But words,&#xD;
I repeat, are utterly thrown away. I&#xD;
cannot attempt to reform you; I can&#xD;
only pity.; and since no plate, or_ any&#xD;
other valuable article seems to have&#xD;
disappeared--&#xD;
"This is dreadful! insupportable ."&#xD;
cried Hester, feeling acutely the implied&#xD;
accusation of theft.&#xD;
"I shall not,-young woman, give you&#xD;
in charge to a constable. Indeed, Iam&#xD;
instructed to let you go."&#xD;
'Hear me, mnadam !" exclaimed&#xD;
Hester; sobbing and dropping on her&#xD;
knees; "=you are :deceived in; ;the&#xD;

MISFORTUNES ACCUMULATE ON- HESTER.&#xD;
IT so happened that the house of&#xD;
Mrs. Greatheart was the -first which&#xD;
Hester visited after the labors bf Mr.&#xD;
Pike'had been brought to a close.&#xD;
Little suspecting what a tale had been&#xD;
communicated to the inmates,- the&#xD;
young teacher came, as usual,-to give&#xD;
musical-instruction to Mrs. Greatheart's&#xD;
two daughters. The servant opened&#xD;
the door to her as at other times, and&#xD;
she proceeded to the drawing-room ;&#xD;
but the piano remained locked, and&#xD;
there was something extraordinary in&#xD;
the demeanor of the children, who did&#xD;
not welcome- her, or hang upon her&#xD;
arm as on former occasions, but shrank&#xD;
away in aversion or fear.&#xD;
Presently Mrs. Greatheart, in a cold&#xD;
and stately manner, entered the room.&#xD;
She gazed slowly around, apparently&#xD;
in search of some object, and muttered&#xD;
to herself: "No, nothing is gone, and&#xD;
there is nothing here to take--we are&#xD;
safe."&#xD;
The lady then bent a keen inquiring&#xD;
look 'on Hester, neither bowing nor&#xD;
nodding. The surprise of-the latter&#xD;
incraased.-:&#xD;
" So, you are come, Miss Innocent.&#xD;
Very well; now, perhaps, you will have&#xD;
the goodness to leave.the houseasgain."&#xD;
*And why, dear madaa ?" asked&#xD;
Hester, in great trepidation.&#xD;
"Of course you- don't know why-&#xD;
you are ignorant of everything-ah!&#xD;

" Ti  fountain has been cut off again,&#xD;

Pike to Hartley. "You see I grow&#xD;
quite poetical, sir-halI ha ! In plain&#xD;
words, our plan has answered admi-&#xD;
rably, the people have all shut their&#xD;
doors against the girl, so her money-&#xD;
making in that way is for ever at=an&#xD;
end."&#xD;
" You are a clever knave, my friend&#xD;
-a very clever knave 1" said Hartley,&#xD;
shaking the little man by the hand.&#xD;
"Not a knave, sir, if you please.&#xD;
Thr ugh these exertions, do I'not gain&#xD;
a title to my annuity, which, being&#xD;
laid by, will form a 'provision for a&#xD;
peaceful and happy old age ?'Do I&#xD;

place he so richly deserves ? I should&#xD;
rather deserve the character were I to&#xD;
assist him in escaping from prison, and&#xD;
so violate the laws of this. country.&#xD;
No, no, Mr. Hartley ; call ne not a&#xD;
knave."    =&#xD;
The moody Templar smiled, and beg-&#xD;
ged the attorney's pardon. The word&#xD;
was not uttered as a term of reproach,&#xD;
but of commendation. Mr. Pike was&#xD;
satisfied, and bolted his office door,&#xD;
lest any client might enter- without&#xD;
first knocking.&#xD;
"But your inner door," observed&#xD;
Hartley, "stands open; I hope your&#xD;
servant is not there to overhear us."&#xD;
"I have no.servant,",said the-fund -&#xD;
holder: " I-I can't afford such a thing.&#xD;

"Can we not put an end to this alto.&#xD;

" How?" said Pike,:turning upin-&#xD;

"By removing the girl."&#xD;
"RenovingCher,?"&#xD;
"Yes, that she may trouble usno&#xD;
more."&#xD;
"There is danger in that," said Mr.&#xD;
Pike, thoughtfully ; "dangerto your--&#xD;
self as well as to me."&#xD;
"Pshaw! danger."&#xD;
"Miss Hester is -no infant; the other&#xD;
was an infant, and couldn't tell tales;&#xD;
we, carried that other of), and it was&#xD;
dropped in the street. Wherever the&#xD;
child may now be-if she isn't dead-.&#xD;
I hope she is.an honest servant;atd so&#xD;
not the worse for the change. Oi?!es,&#xD;
I trust the dear innocent I-'bore away&#xD;
from- the halls of pride and luxuryis&#xD;
now happy."&#xD;
"Never mind that child, and lten't&#xD;
allude to things of past'years _ intruth,&#xD;
I had nearly forgotten that' matter:4f&#xD;
'Somerset's eldest ,hild,"  observed&#xD;
Hartley, moving'in his chair {rather&#xD;
1menisily.&#xD;
"What can-we do with this young&#xD;
woman ?" asked Mr. Pikes&#xD;
"Thrust hernout ofthe waystop&#xD;
her hand, and silence hertongue."&#xD;
The emaciated Jtimbs of' the miser&#xD;
trembled in his oldblack clothes and&#xD;
his cheek'took a livid, huea sle slowly&#xD;
turned' his eyes to Hartley.&#xD;
"What ails thee, friend ?" whispered&#xD;
the Templar.&#xD;
'Tis dangerous, I say; far too-dan-&#xD;
gerous."&#xD;
"What?"&#xD;
" The-spilling=--of--her blood l"&#xD;
"Dismiss such a thought; youmis'&#xD;
take me entirely. I would not' have&#xD;
thee burden thy sensitive conscience&#xD;
with, the memory of a murder.   I&#xD;
meditate nothing algainstthe life of the&#xD;
girl "&#xD;
Mr. Pike breathed again, and, wiping&#xD;
his forehead with his coarse cotton&#xD;
handkerchief, hisagitation  passed&#xD;
away; while a -satisfied.sbile drew up&#xD;
the corners =ofhisthin mouth.&#xD;
" I simply1wish?,".observed-Hartley,&#xD;
that she' should be =taken out gi&#xD;

"Mr. Hartley, I have, on several&#xD;
occasions, run considerable risks. The&#xD;
matter of the Regent-street mi liner,&#xD;
with the feigned illness of Mr-. Snierset,&#xD;
and the alleged robbery in Oxford-&#xD;
street, went offwell enough,:;but the&#xD;
affair of the spoiled picture was rather&#xD;
an awkward business, for I wa ssum-&#xD;
moned before the, magistrate; while&#xD;
this last transaction-my personating&#xD;
the Reverend 1r. Smith,.member of&#xD;
the Fraud-Preventing:Society,' would,&#xD;
if discovered, place -me in a very dan-&#xD;
gerous -position; ,nevertheless, Iwill&#xD;
never flinch-L am again at your ser-&#xD;
vice."&#xD;
Worthy man," said Hartley, "you&#xD;
shall lose nothing'by your fidelity, de-&#xD;
pend uponit."'&#xD;
"It has just occurred to me that we&#xD;
might cause Miss Hester tc be carried&#xD;
away from- London in a very natural=&#xD;
manner. ,..mean that the act, should&#xD;
it come to light, will appear to the&#xD;
world by no means strange; but .only&#xD;
one of those, bold deeds.which so fre-&#xD;
quently occur, prompted, by human&#xD;
passions.  At the same time,.;come&#xD;
what maysthe party who decoys the&#xD;
young woman will have to bear all the&#xD;
odium that may attach to the 'outrage."&#xD;
"A very good'-a capital idea., But&#xD;
who will be.fool;enough to elope with&#xD;
this needy child "&#xD;
"I have gained information that a&#xD;
youngman, is deeply in love with, her,&#xD;
and, that Miss Hester has rejected his&#xD;
suit, probably;because he is' defoi-medb&#xD;
-a~ hunchback."&#xD;
Pike's meditated project was in-&#xD;
stantly apparent tothe clear head- of&#xD;
Hartley, and he saw how much might&#xD;
be made of the incident.&#xD;
" Ahunchback ?-is he in a low walk&#xD;
oflife ?".&#xD;
"He is a violin-player in the.orches-&#xD;
tra of a minor theatre."&#xD;
Anotheridea rose in the fiendish&#xD;
minad otartley. Evenhis familysp'ride&#xD;
was second to his revenge. He would&#xD;
rather that his niece were the wife of a&#xD;
ploughman than: of   , peer. Hester&#xD;
borne off, and married to a theatrical&#xD;
musician, a hideous deformed being--&#xD;
here again he should humiliate his&#xD;
enemy,:proud, although in prison ; and&#xD;
hereturn one screw more in the instra-&#xD;
ment of.torture.&#xD;
"Mr. Pike, I approve of your scheme,&#xD;
but I leave the details, and the carrying&#xD;
e         out of the business, entirely to yourself,&#xD;
&#xD;
being satisfied as to your sound judg-&#xD;
ment and unvarying sagacity.    Re-&#xD;
member, my friend,,however great&#xD;
your exertions may be, you shall lose&#xD;
nothing, I repeat, by your fidelity."&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
A COFFEE-HOUsE NEAR THE RLEE PRIsON.&#xD;
-THE HUNCHBAnK MUSICIAN is raMr-&#xD;
ED TO COMMIT A VILLANY.&#xD;
A6 the .pedestrian.:passes through,&#xD;
Farringdon-street,.the paving stones of&#xD;
which cover the renowned Fleet River,&#xD;
up which, in days of old, Dutch and&#xD;
other European ships were wont tosail,&#xD;
on hostile or commercial, purposes -in-&#xD;
tent, as far as thebridge =that spanned&#xD;
the streamat the foot of Holborn-hill&#xD;
-as the pedestrian, we say, wends&#xD;
through the;time-honoredthproughfare,&#xD;
his attention is drawn to a remarkable&#xD;
fact. It consists in the melancholy&#xD;
exhibition of a continued, series of&#xD;
spirit-vaults and undertakers' shops.&#xD;
On the east side above the Fleet Prison&#xD;
the principal portion of the houses be-&#xD;
longs to publicans and undertakers,&#xD;
and their places ofbusiness occur, as&#xD;
if by the mutual consent of the owners,&#xD;
nearly alternately. The common ob-&#xD;
server ;will conclude that the men of&#xD;
black, those friends of death, those-&#xD;
familiars of- the charnel-house, have&#xD;
ensconced themsa ves there because&#xD;
spirit-shops abound, well knowing that&#xD;
these invariably bring great custom to&#xD;
their dark profession. They might&#xD;
naturally reason on the advantage. of&#xD;
being upon the spot, for as the draught&#xD;
of fiery poison kills, so no time would&#xD;
be lost in huddling the victims into&#xD;
their narrow homes, and bearing them&#xD;
away where the "dram" shall cease to&#xD;
excite, and the tavern brawl be heard&#xD;
no more.&#xD;
We are, however, induced to ascribe&#xD;
the phenomenon to another cause. We&#xD;
must travel back even a few centuries&#xD;
on the great dusty'road of London&#xD;
records, in order to obtain-a solutionof&#xD;
the enigma. We think, then, 'the&#xD;
memorable, "House" connetedwith&#xD;
our narrative, the Fleet Prison, origi-&#xD;
nally gave rise to this superabundance&#xD;
of spirit-marts and undertakers' shops.&#xD;
Who so thirsty as prisoners?- The&#xD;
lBed1 Indian, pants after the' "fire&#xD;

rally speaking, the man of sorrow and&#xD;
of debt.. Spirits might not have been&#xD;
publicly-sold in *the'prison, but the old&#xD;
wardens, for a small.bribe, winxked at&#xD;
their introduction through the gate.&#xD;
Where .did men die'so fast as within&#xD;
those damp unwholesome dens? .Phy-&#xD;
sical suffering was there, when Newton&#xD;
and Bambridge -had recourse to the&#xD;
chain, and plied the scourge;:'broken&#xD;
.    hearts were ,there, when many an un-&#xD;
happy inmate,, virtuous but unfortu-&#xD;
nate,s pined without hope.&#xD;
Oh . yes, the Fleet Prison was the&#xD;
great patron of the spirit-sellerdadthe&#xD;
coffin-maker. The "House" brought&#xD;
them large custom; theydrove a thriving&#xD;
business. within the shadow of its-grim&#xD;
walls; -and therefore these merchants&#xD;
established marts close by; while,&#xD;
generation after generation, the: sons&#xD;
have' perpetuated the trade;, and 'are&#xD;
loath, even at :the .present. hour,.to&#xD;
quit the scene where' their forefathers&#xD;
amassed so much money.&#xD;
At'the time of'our story, the.street&#xD;
was called-Fleet; Market, vegetable&#xD;
stalls and butchers' shambles being&#xD;
ranged along the. centre of the thorough-&#xD;
fare. We must enter a smallcoffee-house&#xD;
which stood at' the corner -of an alley&#xD;
on the west side.    Theroom -was&#xD;
divided, into a series of 'little boxes&#xD;
painted red, the 'partition between each&#xD;
box being about five feet high. In the&#xD;
early part of .the day, the hduse was&#xD;
much "frequented, because gardeners'&#xD;
and othermarket-folks usuallyrise.with&#xD;
the sun; after its setting, the place was&#xD;
solitary enough.&#xD;
At this coffeehouses, Flemming,&#xD;
when   not engaged at the theatre,&#xD;
frequently spent :his evenings.  He&#xD;
had .now drawn   himself up in the&#xD;
corner of the inner box. His usual&#xD;
cup.of coffee, was drunk, and he. was&#xD;
busily engagedwith the old stump of-&#xD;
a pen copying' music.' He continued&#xD;
for a considerableatime absorbed-in-this&#xD;
occupation, when a gentleman, dressed&#xD;
inrusty black, quietly -stole into the&#xD;
box, and seated himself on therextre-&#xD;
mity of the form. The coffee-room was&#xD;
almost deserted; Flemming, therefore,&#xD;
turned rather angrily towards the in-&#xD;
truder,a&amp;amp;nd looked at shim as much- as&#xD;
to say,"Gould you' not seat yourself&#xD;
elsewhere? there is plenty of-room?&#xD;
But the' stranger did not take the&#xD;
implied hint;he only looked hard and&#xD;

fled a little-nearer Otowards him.&#xD;
"Oh! .is it youMr. Jones'?" said&#xD;
Flemming. ":I beg pardon; I am glad&#xD;
to see'you."&#xD;
"Mr. Jones-extended:his hand tothe&#xD;
hunchbacksmiling='benignantly. :e&#xD;
did not" take off-his. hat, the' brim of&#xD;
which was ,remarkably wide,.but he&#xD;
quietly pressed it furtherover his-eyes;&#xD;
his drawn-up shirt-collar, too, concealed&#xD;
much sof the lower part of his-face, the&#xD;
mouth only being seen extending-from&#xD;
one white linen-point to the other.'&#xD;
It was at this coffee-house thatilem-&#xD;
ming firstmet Mr. Jones, who appeared&#xD;
to himia singularly discreet and quiet&#xD;
person. Mr. Jones:introduced-himself&#xD;
as a man of letters, and an author;'but,&#xD;
becomingTacquainted with'Flemming's&#xD;
pursuits, he immediately, in additidh&#xD;
to his literary predilections, professed&#xD;
a great love for the divineart of-musie&#xD;
Indeed, Mr. Jones-had seemed 'to take&#xD;
a strong=interest in -the welfare as well&#xD;
as the occupation of the solitary young&#xD;
man;. and the poor deformed, rarely&#xD;
receiving courtesy or attention,-felt'his&#xD;
gratitude awakened while his heart&#xD;
warmed towards the=stranger.&#xD;
"May Ipresume," said the gentle-&#xD;
man in rusty black, after, a-little 'de-&#xD;
sultory conversation, and edging'more&#xD;
closely to Flemnming-" may I presume&#xD;
to wish you joy?"&#xD;
"Joy Ion what account?:Becautse&#xD;
we brought out a.neW-piece last night&#xD;
at the theatre-? -Yes, it was gather suc-&#xD;
cessful."&#xD;
"'Nonsense l" said Mr. Iones. "I&#xD;

me, will greatly affectyour happiness&#xD;

dear young gentleman, but I have taken&#xD;
a great fancy to you ; my heart yearns&#xD;

Upon this, the worthy man looked&#xD;

Mr. Jones was silent for a few mi-&#xD;
nutes his mannerswas deeply abstact-&#xD;
ed; yet, in familiar phrase,:we 'Cmay&#xD;
say'he was meditating on the:best way&#xD;
to spring upon his'game, and was beat-&#xD;

Yes, my dear;youth, I wishyou to&#xD;

Has not =theydear young creature ac-&#xD;
cepted your suit?"&#xD;
Deep ,gloom :shadowed the counte-&#xD;
nance of Flemming, and he cast at the&#xD;
man who addressed him look full of,&#xD;
anguish, but did not speak.&#xD;
" Pooryouth !- -unhappy child!"said'&#xD;
the sympathining Mr. Jones, alias our&#xD;
old friend, 'Mr. Pike.  I 'read:the-&#xD;
truth ; shehas-refused you. :But why&#xD;
1o8cast down ? There is hope ret."&#xD;
"None-none 11"said Flemmmg with&#xD;
a groan.&#xD;
"Oh! yes,there is, hope. -I know&#xD;
what woman is; experience has taught&#xD;
rue thegrand 'secret.. The love of wo-&#xD;
mfan is-always tobe-won."&#xD;
"But not by. 1e-not by a being'&#xD;
like me 1"&#xD;
Yes,f by one like you. Your fea-&#xD;
turesare ,ine-Antinous-like--your&#xD;
mind is theinind of a philosopher and&#xD;
a poet. I affirm, Mark Flemming, you&#xD;
are in every:respect worthy of Miss&#xD;
Somerset!"&#xD;
,:The poor hunchback looked incredu--&#xD;
lously at the speaker, and shook his&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"Partiality, 'my:'rgood friend, has&#xD;
rendered you blind."&#xD;
"No.; Lean 'see,"'said Mr. Pike,,for&#xD;
-   so shall :e nowcall the counterfeit&#xD;
Jones ; "and I can appreciate,' too.&#xD;
But listen. If the dear nd beautiful&#xD;
girl has, through ,ignorance, ofUyour&#xD;
merits,; indeed refused you,I an not&#xD;
one to advise:huinility on your part.&#xD;
Rinility never won;a=victory overthe&#xD;

cause man is the superior animal; yes,&#xD;
remember, this-.the superior animal,&#xD;
my boy. 'Tis ours not to cringe and&#xD;
pray, but toconquer and command I"&#xD;
The :little lawyer, on making this&#xD;
bold, and, in.his opinion, manly and&#xD;
philosophical assertion, struckthe table&#xD;
with his clenched fist.&#xD;
"Alas !" said Flemming, "what you&#xD;
say may be true or false; it concerns&#xD;
me little. I only feel that Miss Somer-&#xD;
set is lost to me forever--she loves&#xD;
another!"&#xD;
"That's it,-is it? So much-the bet'&#xD;
ter; more glory in triumphing over a&#xD;
rival.",&#xD;
"Why, you speak as 'though the task&#xD;
were nothing :to -conquer a wqman's&#xD;
antipathies, and bend'her to our will."&#xD;
" And it is nothing," said Mr. Pike,&#xD;
in -a confident tone; "that is, nothing&#xD;
when: one is resolved to do ,it. .The&#xD;
brave;of heart must-triumph ; it is, the&#xD;
law of nature. but tell me candidly,&#xD;
do 'yourthink your happiness would be&#xD;
enhanced by Miss Somerset-becoming&#xD;
your wife ?"&#xD;
The eyes of 'the hunchback sparkled&#xD;
andiflashed,,until, like-diamonds, they&#xD;
seemed 'to be:instinct; with light; the&#xD;
glow of,-enthusiasmmounted' from his&#xD;
cheeks 'to his -forehead. 'Rising from&#xD;
the form,, he whispered into Pike's ear :&#xD;
"To possess' her would be paradise&#xD;
.4o live without heris --"&#xD;
"Very well ; I: understand. Your&#xD;
passion -is precisely whatit :should{be,&#xD;
and, if gratified, will form.the, spring&#xD;
of all earthly bliss. My:dear youth----&#xD;
my adopted son--if- Imay be' allowed&#xD;
to call you so--the young lady, never&#xD;
fear, shall be'yours;I",&#xD;
Mr.= Pike moved out of the box, and&#xD;
looked cautiously-aroun d; no listener&#xD;
was near ; one old man, only, at the ex-&#xD;
tremity of the room, hung asleep over&#xD;
his toast. The time had come when-the&#xD;
houseiwas usuallyclosed for the night;&#xD;
b'ut he crossed to the'waiter and ordered&#xD;
two cups ;of coffeessaying that:he and&#xD;
his friend wished remain half an&#xD;
hour' longer', having some particular&#xD;
businessto transact.&#xD;
a= Pike returned -o Flemming, and he&#xD;
now-spoke in 'lowj cautious whispers.&#xD;
For a=longe time the.hunchback was a&#xD;
patient=listener, while the other ap-&#xD;
peared to be proposingsome plan  r&#xD;
execution. Pike wa~s isold and cn,&#xD;
&#xD;
but the nervousness and excitability of&#xD;
Flemming Were roused to a fearful&#xD;
degree.&#xD;
, "I would win her-I would marry&#xD;
her !" cried the latter; "but to disre-&#xD;
gard her own feelings and wishes-to&#xD;
compel her to become my wife-this is&#xD;
base ; this is an outrage not to be con-&#xD;
templated."&#xD;
"'You reason falsely, dear youth.&#xD;
I am a man of experience ; I know the,&#xD;
world, and human nature ; I am a&#xD;
strong advocate, too, for all that is&#xD;
humane and honorable.    Look you,&#xD;
what peasant or beggar-boy is this she&#xD;
has set her affections on? A scamp,&#xD;
no doubt ; a drunken, idle vagabond,&#xD;
who, fit for nothing else, enlisted as a&#xD;
common soldier, and is now sunk in&#xD;
dissipation, or worn by disease, in a&#xD;
foreign land."&#xD;
":Ah!" saidFlemming, eagerly,"that's&#xD;
a good view of the question ; such an&#xD;
idea never struck me before. Thank&#xD;
you, thank you! I will believe this."&#xD;
" Why, to save her from such a&#xD;
wretch would be a meritorious deed.&#xD;
Women will not understand, or believe&#xD;
what is good for them. Obstinacy is&#xD;
the besetting sin of the dear, pretty&#xD;
creatures. But be it yours to rescue&#xD;
Miss Somerset from her evil position,&#xD;
and make her happy."&#xD;
"Againsther will?"askedFlemming,1&#xD;
"Yes, against her will."&#xD;
This is singular.reasoning, I con-&#xD;
fess, and quite new to me."&#xD;
"It is philosophical, , sound, ,and l&#xD;
good, nevertheless."&#xD;
"But ,a serious difficulty occurs :toa&#xD;
me.   How, in the name of law and I&#xD;
the holy church, shall I induce Missa&#xD;
Somerset to marry me ?"^t&#xD;
"Why," answered Pike,. "in these i&#xD;
cases, we cannot always do as we wish. t&#xD;
Circumstances are our masters. We&#xD;
must use compulsion."&#xD;
"Fiend?" said Flemming, winding&#xD;
his muscular, trembling fingers about&#xD;
Pike's arm; "are you a man or a&#xD;
devil?'"&#xD;
S"The first, I hope ; and, perhaps,&#xD;
your good genius,"&#xD;
- ",An infernal one,. rather, leading&#xD;
me on to sin and perdition I"      b&#xD;
Mr. Pikesaw at once that Fleruming b&#xD;
possessed high and. stern principles, a&#xD;
he had, therefore, to call into requisi-&#xD;
tion all hislogipal powers in order to t&#xD;
bear; these principles down., .His so- d&#xD;
phistry so far succeeded, that, in a s&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
ME:RSET.                        121&#xD;
brief -time, he lulled to.rest the first&#xD;
rebel emotions which virtue and a sense&#xD;
of right raised in Flemming's,reast.&#xD;
"But admit you reason. rightly"&#xD;
said the hunchback, "in asserting that,&#xD;
to work out good ends, we rmustfre-&#xD;
quently have, recourse; to means ap-&#xD;
parently evil, is iS probable or possible&#xD;
that Miss Somerset, after such &amp;amp; ter-&#xD;
rible transaction, would ever love me?"&#xD;
" Certainly she would; your kind-&#xD;
ness will soothe her; she will become&#xD;
acquainted with your worth and super&#xD;
rior intellect. Her former preposses-&#xD;
sions will vanish, and love, the deep&#xD;
and entire love of a wife,.will be the&#xD;
result."&#xD;
"Now could I believe this, or that&#xD;
such indeed would be.the happy con-&#xD;
sequence, I would risk breaking for&#xD;

The clock on St. Andrew's-hill struck&#xD;
twelve.&#xD;
" Please, gentlemen," said the waiter,&#xD;
drawing near to the box, "the alf&#xD;
hour is, up, and .we, must shut.the&#xD;
house."&#xD;
The two rose together, and, having&#xD;
paid for their, refreshment, walked&#xD;
forth into the street. A little longer&#xD;
Pike urged his friend to make up his&#xD;
resolve on the subject under considera-&#xD;
tion. Flemniing wavered and argued,&#xD;
being tossed on a sea of perplexity.&#xD;
One moment he repulsed his .coun&#xD;
panion as a monster, and ;the.next,&#xD;
listening to his reasonings, and blinded&#xD;
by his own passion, he regarded him&#xD;
as an oracle of wisdom. Nevertheless,&#xD;
he' prayed for another day to, consider&#xD;
of the matter; and once more thanidng&#xD;
he pseudo man of letters for the warm&#xD;
interest which he took in his welfare,&#xD;
he hunchback returned to his lodgings.&#xD;

HESTE-R SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
w&#xD;
&#xD;
her this grievous wrong cut him to the&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
Alas ! poor wanderer on the desert&#xD;
of a despised existence! weak strag-&#xD;
gler with the strong passions of hu-&#xD;
manity ! we would throw, a veil over&#xD;
that night of mental conflict and keen&#xD;
suffering.  Thou  didst strive  long&#xD;
against the sweeping tide of all that&#xD;
is evil in our nature ; but the Tempter&#xD;
was there. The fiends held out to thee&#xD;
the intoxicating joy of sin, and, the&#xD;
barren bliss of virtue.  They mad-&#xD;
dened thy soul with their hellish cup,&#xD;
and they triumphed. ' Thou wouldst&#xD;
make the helpless one thy victim.&#xD;
&#xD;
like wave on wave, followed each&#xD;
other, and flooded his soul. Y et the&#xD;
fair being; the subject. of all his wild&#xD;
cogitations, was asleep in the apart-&#xD;
ment above him. Her mind, though&#xD;
steeped;in sorrow, was free from guile,&#xD;
therefore .the angel spread his downy&#xD;
- winnowing wings over her, and soothed&#xD;
her with visions of radiance and beauty,&#xD;
and opened to her pure spirit glimpses&#xD;
as of a fairer world.&#xD;
Flemming regarded Hester as his&#xD;
victiin, and yet in the light of his&#xD;
cherished wife. Then the-idea pre-&#xD;
sented itself of her aversion, of her&#xD;
horror at 'his deformity; and such&#xD;
thoughts were followed by the con-&#xD;
virtion that nothing short of stratagem&#xD;
or force would ever make her his.&#xD;
The wily arguments of the Tempter&#xD;
possessed their due weight ; yet Flem-j&#xD;
ming's judgment was sound enough to&#xD;
enable him to distinguish right from&#xD;
wrong ; and he could not disguise the&#xD;
fact that, in carrying Hester away&#xD;
from  her home and her father, and&#xD;
urging her to become his wife against&#xD;
her will, he should commit a heinous&#xD;
crime. - The question to be decided&#xD;
was, should he, preserving his honor&#xD;
and honesty, stoically abandon her, or,&#xD;
listening to his passion, perpetrate thea&#xD;
wrong ?                        -&#xD;
Had his mind, by a course of profli-&#xD;
gacy, become hardened, or had his&#xD;
principles been -less high and fixed, his&#xD;
line of-conduct would soon have been&#xD;
adopted, and -the struggle, if any,&#xD;
easily brought to a close. But now,&#xD;
all that was pure and noble was op-&#xD;
posed- to all that was black and selfish.&#xD;
Virtue combated with Vice. His heart,&#xD;
in a 'word, was like a battle-ground,&#xD;
where the fiends strove with angels.&#xD;
"Mine-mine 1" he muttered to him-&#xD;
self; ."she shall be mine. The despised&#xD;
hunchback, the mocked, the trampled&#xD;
on, the loathed, shall know one bliss at&#xD;
least before he dies."&#xD;
His hands clutched the bedclothes ;&#xD;
his eyesin the darkness gleamed&#xD;
wildly, and he lay for some moments&#xD;
in a dream of happiness.. But speedily.&#xD;
his better feelings revived; the voice of&#xD;
conscience sounded through thecham-&#xD;
bere of his soul : the distress of -Hes-&#xD;
ter, theeanguish of :the imprisoned&#xD;
father, appalled"his fancy,and above&#xD;
all, the: unprotected, friendless -posi-'&#xD;

THE MEETING IN BARTHoLoMEw-CLosE--&#xD;
THE WEB IS ~WEAVING MORE CLOSELY&#xD;
AROUND HESTER.&#xD;
MR.- PiRE and. Flemming met, by&#xD;
appointment the next day, in the small&#xD;
square north of Christ-Church Hospi-&#xD;
tal,, known by the name of Bartholo-&#xD;
mew-Close. The attorney was all en-&#xD;
ergy, good-humor, and, buoyancy of&#xD;
spirits, but the hunchback was reserv-&#xD;
ed, stern, and silent.&#xD;
" How is it with thee, my dear young&#xD;
friend ? You look pale, and your man-&#xD;
ner is disordered ; but take courage-&#xD;
yes, courage -is the noblest attribute of&#xD;
man ; without it we can achieve nothing&#xD;
great, nothing worthy of our destiny."&#xD;
"And nothing stupendously wicked,"&#xD;
added Flemmiag.&#xD;
" That which constitutes wickedness&#xD;
is a matter of opinion-quite a matter&#xD;
of opinion.  Some call Alexander,&#xD;
Casar, and Napoleon wicked ; others&#xD;
hail them ?as heroes and deni-gods.&#xD;
To. pluck the flower of beauty, to bear&#xD;
away the goddess of your worship, this&#xD;
is not wickedness. You do but follow&#xD;
the great examples of the worthies of&#xD;
old; the names of Paris and Theseus&#xD;
are crowned with the deathless bays of&#xD;
poetry for the abductions they made.&#xD;
That whieh French and other Euro-&#xD;
pean kings, enjoying every gratification&#xD;
besides, did not scruple to do, surely a.&#xD;
subject; whose means of pleasure are&#xD;
so contracted, may well be excused in&#xD;
performing.  But we must descend&#xD;
from the classical and the past to the,&#xD;
life-of the present hour. AhI my&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER S OM E R S E'T.&#xD;
&#xD;
friend, this existence of ours is lament-&#xD;
ably short ; let us enjoy the dream&#xD;
while it is in our power ; let us not&#xD;
dash away the' cup of rapture when&#xD;
offered to our lips !"&#xD;
"A truce to this philosophy 1". ex-&#xD;
claimed Flemming, impatiently; "you&#xD;
are a man of letters, Mr. Jones, and I&#xD;
am a devotee of music ; we cannot,&#xD;
therefore, exactly understand  each&#xD;
other."&#xD;
" Speak not so, my adopted son ; I&#xD;
wish'our sentiments'to be in harmony,&#xD;
And our esteem and love to be mutual.&#xD;
But how say you ? will you possess the&#xD;
being of your- heart, or will you re-&#xD;
nounce her? Will you render yourself&#xD;
and her happy, or will'you be content&#xD;
to be lonely- and miserable ? What&#xD;
determination have you formed ?"&#xD;
"1The struggle is over-passion has&#xD;
triuinphed -hell has prevailed," said&#xD;
Flemming, groaning inwardly.&#xD;
Mr. Pike seized his hand, and cor-&#xD;
dially shook it. The little smiling&#xD;
visage of the lawyer offered, indeed, a&#xD;
striking contrast to the countenance of&#xD;
the other, which was livid, and had a&#xD;
ghastly expression.,&#xD;
'Right, my dear friend, right ; your&#xD;
decision is-that of a man of sense and&#xD;
of courage. But, out'on you, boy ! you&#xD;
are always dreaming of the bugbear&#xD;
crime.  Had you lived as 'long, and&#xD;
studied as much as I, these mists which&#xD;
now float around your intellect would&#xD;
have vanished, and in the pure sun-&#xD;
shine you would behold 'the sublime&#xD;
forms of'Reason and Truth.""&#xD;
",To business, Mr. Jones.  What&#xD;
now is your advice ?"&#xD;
" Yes, certainly, to business. I have&#xD;
got up the programme of that imagin-&#xD;
ary concert, which, we. must suppose,&#xD;
will be held in the West-end of London.&#xD;
Let me see; on what night had we bet-&#xD;
ter fix it?"&#xD;
Mr. Pike, as he spoke, drew from his&#xD;
pocket a long slip of, paper, which re-&#xD;
senibled any 6theit theatrical or.concert&#xD;
bill, except that it was 'in manuscript,&#xD;
he himself being too cautiousto einploy&#xD;
afprinter.&#xD;
"What night, I say, ;shall our con-&#xD;
cet e e?"&#xD;
"Sir," said Flemming, "you speak&#xD;
as if I were ertainof winning Miss&#xD;
&amp;amp;onierset'5 coseit toaccompany us."&#xD;
"" True'' Ioalfnfoiot th t little&#xD;

obtain money for that father of 'hers.&#xD;
Mr. Flemming, let us moveto the"dead&#xD;
wall yonder ; I don't like these houses&#xD;
here--some one may be listening."&#xD;
The com panions walked to the spot&#xD;
named, and there, in cautiously why&#xD;
pered words, the apparently kind pa=&#xD;
tron and the blinded prote9 consult-&#xD;
ed further together, and settled their&#xD;
plans.&#xD;
The day succeeding the above 'meet-&#xD;
ing, Flemming resolved to address&#xD;
Hester: By a long and violent strug-&#xD;
gle, he had thrust aside his better prin-&#xD;
ciples, and brought his' mind to em&#xD;
brace a black determination. Fo the&#xD;
first time in his life ie'was about to&#xD;
act the hypocrite and villain.&#xD;
Flemming entered Hester's room,&#xD;
holding a printed programme in his,&#xD;
hand ; for, at the suggestion' of Pike,&#xD;
to carry out a seeming of reality, le&#xD;
had caused a few bills tQ be printed.&#xD;
His step was steadyand his hand did&#xD;
not tremble; his countenance only.wa&#xD;
deadly pale.&#xD;
"Miss Somerset, may I say ' word&#xD;
to you'? May I ask you a question ?"&#xD;
"Walk in," exclaimed Hester, cheer=&#xD;
fully ; for, endeavoringd toforget' her&#xD;
late 'sorrows, she had -been busily en-&#xD;
gaged thinking of some method-to rg-&#xD;
trieve her fortunes. At present she&#xD;
was without employment, and had&#xD;
formed no definite plans forthe future.&#xD;
Hester did -not regard Flemmningwith&#xD;
feelings of aversion, but had forgotten&#xD;
and forgiven the past. She hopedand&#xD;
believed that his: good sense had en-&#xD;
abled' him to conquer the unfortunate&#xD;
passion he once entertained. 'Perceiv-&#xD;
ing now the bill in his hand, she ad-&#xD;
dressed him without embarrassmenti&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Flemming, you offered&#xD;
good advice to me on one occasion,;and&#xD;
I profited by it, until the enemy worked&#xD;
my ruin. What have you to propose&#xD;
noW ?"&#xD;
"Not much," said Flemming7 in- a&#xD;
husky voice ; "but believirig'that your&#xD;
time just at present is unoccupied, and&#xD;
that a few pounds gained by';a' 'little&#xD;
exertion Wduld not altogether be unac&#xD;
ceptabl-"&#xD;
"They would be mot -acceptable.&#xD;
My poor-father's weekly' allowance,&#xD;
whether I labor or not, must 'be Tpad'&#xD;
and I wish to procure for hini'some&#xD;
necessaries which he has lot gsto'od in&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSE-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
These words of the innocent, unsus-&#xD;
pecting, and dutiful child powerfully&#xD;
affected Flemming. Hegazed in her&#xD;
beautiful face wistfully. And must he&#xD;
overthrow her fond 'filial projects, and&#xD;
link the lot of this lovely confiding&#xD;
being to that of a monster like himself ?&#xD;
He was unable to proceed with the&#xD;
words he had intended to utter, but&#xD;
presently subdued the choking in his&#xD;
throat:-&#xD;
"I have here the programme of a1&#xD;
concert in which I am interested, being&#xD;
one of the projectors. It takes place at&#xD;
the Hanover-square Rooms in a few&#xD;
days' time. The instrumental and vo-&#xD;
cal performers have all been engaged,&#xD;
except one ; we are still in rant of a&#xD;
good piano-forte-player."&#xD;
"Impossible !" exclaimed Hester ;&#xD;
" I have never played in public."&#xD;
"But every one must have a begin-&#xD;
ning, dear Miss Somerset ; and this&#xD;
debAt-may be highly advantageous to&#xD;
you ; it may lead to other engagements,&#xD;
and ultimately prove -the means of&#xD;
your gaining much money."&#xD;
Much money-this was the hre, the&#xD;
all-powerful spell, that ever operated&#xD;
on the mind of Hester. The obtaining&#xD;
of her father's freedom was the subject&#xD;
always uppermost in her thoughts. To&#xD;
advance this end, what feelings would&#xD;
she not sacrifice? what project would&#xD;
she not dare ?-&#xD;
" But even if I were inclined to offer&#xD;
my services, do you think, Mr. Flem-&#xD;
ming, I can play well enough to fill the-&#xD;
part assigned to me,?"&#xD;
"There is no question of it.",&#xD;
"I doubt it," said Hester, shaking&#xD;
her head.&#xD;
"The sum is small," observed Flem-&#xD;
ming, anxious to bring his task to a&#xD;
close ; "'very small, I allow,; the piano-&#xD;
forte-player for the evening is to receive&#xD;
five pounds."&#xD;
"Five pounds. I.Ithink it a great&#xD;
deal-very handsome.   Five pounds&#xD;
would support my father and myself&#xD;
for a month."&#xD;
"Then make yourself mistress of&#xD;
the money, dear Miss. Somerset; no-&#xD;
thing, I: assure'you, will be easier."&#xD;
"Let me see the programme," said&#xD;
rester, eagerly ; "what tunes shall I&#xD;
have to play? there is so little time for&#xD;
preparation."&#xD;
"The tunes selected are very simple;&#xD;
I think you  nothem all. Iut say&#xD;
the wo-d, that you will attendhe eon-&#xD;
&#xD;
cert, and I will immediately hire a&#xD;
piano, so that you may at once begin&#xD;
to practise."&#xD;
You are kind-verykind. I do not&#xD;
know how to express my obligations,&#xD;
to you. This concert, coul4 I muster&#xD;
courage to attend it, might indeed be&#xD;
a desirable opening for me. Well, I&#xD;
will endeavor," ,she exclaimed, her-&#xD;
heart palpitating, and the color rush-&#xD;
ing to her cheeks-" I will endeavor to&#xD;
conquer my timidity; I will consider&#xD;
the step as a great-and a solemn duty,&#xD;
and then I shall be supported. Heaven&#xD;
bears me witness that I am influenced-&#xD;
by no promptings of vanity, no desire&#xD;
of public applause. My heart and my&#xD;
soul are devoted to the cause of a suf-&#xD;
fering and imprisoned father."&#xD;
"Then we have your consent ?" said&#xD;
the exulting Flemming. "I will ac-&#xD;
quaint our gentlemen that the parties&#xD;
now filled.. Everything shall be ren-&#xD;
dered easy to you,; and I doubt not&#xD;
you will give high satisfaction to all en-&#xD;
gaged in this musical entertainment."&#xD;
When Flemming had retired to his&#xD;
room, he crept into a corner. Anguish&#xD;
of the most poignant description min-&#xD;
gled with his happy dreams. 'Hisrun-&#xD;
couth limbs'shook as with a frightful&#xD;
palsy, and he struck his forehead'with&#xD;
his bony hand.&#xD;
"Wretch! liar ! worseJhan murderer&#xD;
that I am ! What do Imeditate ? Into&#xD;
what an abyss would I plunge this&#xD;
child of innocence and nature?9 But I&#xD;
adore her-my passion devours me&#xD;

THE HOUSE OF MOCK-MARRIAGE AT&#xD;
wEsTMINsTER.&#xD;
Nor far from the venerable abbey at&#xD;
Westminster, and lying in a south-&#xD;
west direction fromthat ;building, is a&#xD;
district which has long been famous&#xD;
for 'the profligacy, drunkenness and&#xD;
other vicious propensities of itsinhabait-&#xD;
ants.  What the Alsatga of-White-&#xD;

hall, and the gay park of St. James's,&#xD;
has imparted no polish to the rough&#xD;
and ragged colonists; nor has the&#xD;
divine harmony of the bells of St. Mar-&#xD;
garet,=though' pealing over the spot,&#xD;
solemnized their souls, or, by remind-&#xD;
ing them of a hereafter and a God, de-&#xD;
terred-them from one act of low iniquity.&#xD;
The place, in a word, seems entirely to&#xD;
have been given over to the, squalid-&#xD;
ness of poverty, and the }dominion of&#xD;
vice.&#xD;
-iAt the south extremity of this region,&#xD;
and lying back from one of the main&#xD;
thoroughfares, there existed, at , the&#xD;
time of our narrative, a short street al-&#xD;
most--destitute of inhabitants. The&#xD;
reason- of this comparative solitude&#xD;
might be that the houses were in a very&#xD;
dilapidated- condition, some having&#xD;
their windows and doors battered in,&#xD;
and others presenting large apertures&#xD;
in their roofs, which circumstance&#xD;
might lead to the conclusion that they&#xD;
proved such bad property to the land-&#xD;
lord, that he felt no inclination to ex-&#xD;
pend any money in repairs. On the;&#xD;
other, hand, the inhabitants of the&#xD;
neighboring district might, by mutual&#xD;
consent, have appropriated these houses&#xD;
to the transaction of certain business,&#xD;
turning them into depots for the recep-&#xD;
tion of merchandise which had not&#xD;
been paid for; or into places of ap-&#xD;
pointment for the commission of sundry&#xD;
criminal acts. Consequently, thieves&#xD;
and murderers, having a common in-&#xD;
terest in the premises so well suited to&#xD;
their designs, guarded the spot with&#xD;
peculiar care and zealous love.&#xD;
That one house, however, contained&#xD;
some sort of inhabitants was apparent,&#xD;
inasmuch as smoke was seen issuing&#xD;
from a half-fallen chimney, and, in the&#xD;
windows, fragments of brown paper&#xD;
were pasted over divers shattered panes,&#xD;
with a view, evidently, of protecting&#xD;
the inmates from wind and rain.&#xD;
A man, now in the dusk of the even-&#xD;
ing, approached the door of the forbid-&#xD;
ding:and ominous-looking domicile.&#xD;
He tried to turn what appeared to be a.&#xD;
loek, but it would not move ; he pushed&#xD;
against the door, .imagining it might&#xD;
yield to pressure, but he pushed to no&#xD;
purpose; then, for knocker there was&#xD;
none, he struck smartly the lower panel&#xD;
with his boot. This painful and awk-&#xD;
iard application for admission having-&#xD;
been made again and again, a little&#xD;
window was obseved at length to open&#xD;
&#xD;
125&#xD;
&#xD;
above the door, and the next -minute a&#xD;
head presented itself, rendered huge&#xD;
and. uncomely'by a frightful mass of&#xD;
red matted hair; -at the same time, two&#xD;
bloodshot eyes glared down suspicious-&#xD;
ly on him who sought entrance into&#xD;
that house of dilapidation and mystery.&#xD;
"What do you want?" said a gruff&#xD;
voice, issuing from between two huge&#xD;
flame-colored whiskers.&#xD;
"The parson."&#xD;
"What do you mean? there's no&#xD;
parson here. We don't preach, man&#xD;
we are honest tradespeople."&#xD;
" Of course you are ; but I want the&#xD;
parson, for all that."&#xD;
The large head drew in for -a few&#xD;
inches, and seemed to be meditating.&#xD;
Again it spoke :--&#xD;
" I don't know you. Who sent you&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
" A friend."&#xD;
" That's nothing. Friends turn-trait-&#xD;
ors and enemies. 'Tis so in the great&#xD;
world, and so in ours."&#xD;
The visitor mentioned a name which&#xD;
seemed well known to the occupier-of&#xD;
the house, for he instantly exclaimed,&#xD;
"Ho, ho ! we're understanding each&#xD;
other nQw. Perhaps the parson is in&#xD;
the house. Anything else ?"&#xD;
"The password- Free marriage-to&#xD;
all the earth.' Now are you satisfied?".&#xD;
"Yes," said the owner of the head,&#xD;
which instantly disappeared.&#xD;
In a few minutes the un drawing of&#xD;
a rusty bolt was heard, and the black&#xD;
door opened just wide enough to admit&#xD;
the body of the applicant, who glided&#xD;
in. The passage where the men stood&#xD;
was almost dark, one tallow candle only&#xD;
burning in a hole in the wall, formed&#xD;
by the removal of some bricks. The&#xD;
doors of the two rooms -on the ground&#xD;
floor were carefully closed ; but un-&#xD;
washed, wo'rmeaten stairs, flanked 'by&#xD;
half-broken balusters, intimated that&#xD;
dwelling apartments might be found'&#xD;
above.&#xD;
Mr. Pike was constitutionally bold,&#xD;
or his heart would have failed him,&#xD;
thus placed in such a den, face to face&#xD;
with the ferocious man of the huge&#xD;
head. The fellow was 'dressed in a&#xD;
brown fustian jacket; his brawny chest&#xD;
was open, rough as the chest of Esau,&#xD;
except that the hair, matching with his&#xD;
whiskers, was"of a fiery hue. His&#xD;
nether .person  displayed  corduroy&#xD;
breeches ard yellow leather gaiters.'&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
" I am the keeper of the house. .A&#xD;
customer, I suppose ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Pike. " This is th&#xD;
first time I have had any business ii&#xD;
your way, but it may lead to more."&#xD;
"Thank'ee," said the man, whose&#xD;
name was Judkins.&#xD;
"A good institution yours, friend&#xD;
when people want quick nuptials. _ Bu&#xD;
don't think me a fool; I know, o&#xD;
course, your marriages are worthless.'&#xD;
"1Worthless !'' said Mr. Judkins&#xD;
with a frown.f&#xD;
" Come, come, friend, we understand&#xD;
each other," said Pike, taking the&#xD;
man's rough hand. " Good blind to&#xD;
satisfy girls, scrupulous. damsels, who&#xD;
else woul  never, listen, perhaps,, to&#xD;
those whql want to be their husbands.'&#xD;
Saying which, a pleasant smile showed&#xD;
Mr. Pike's sharp yellow teeth from ear&#xD;
to ear. The man also grinned, and&#xD;
smoothed his great whiskers.&#xD;
"Why, we do transact a little busi-&#xD;
ness in that way. The girls who come&#xD;
up to London from the-country don't,&#xD;
of course, know very much ;. but then&#xD;
they're remarkably shy,; so we pacify&#xD;
them with our parson here, and they&#xD;
live very peaceable and easy with their&#xD;
husbands afterwards. Yes, asyou say,,&#xD;
ours is a fine institution."&#xD;
"Well, friend, can I see this parson,?"&#xD;
" No ; he don't manage' the business.&#xD;
The concern is mine, and I make the&#xD;
bargains."&#xD;
As Mr. Judkins said this, he took&#xD;
the candle out of the hole in the wall,&#xD;
and, touching a spring, one of the doors&#xD;
in the passage flew open.&#xD;
"We.won't stand here in the draught.&#xD;
Come into the church," said the mas-&#xD;
ter of this house of mock-marriage._&#xD;
As Pike- entered, he cast his. eyes&#xD;
around the room, the original windows&#xD;
of which appeared to have been blocked&#xD;
up. The smoky flame of the dripping&#xD;
candle -which his companion carried&#xD;
in his hand enabled him faintly to dis-&#xD;
tinguish objects. The brick floor was&#xD;
sanded; two wooden forms stood in&#xD;
the centre, while, .at the head of the&#xD;
apartment, was a small desk made of&#xD;
smoothly-planed boards, ,painted red.&#xD;
A pillow, covered with ,a green cloth,&#xD;
served for a cushion, and on it was&#xD;
seen a clasped book, that might or&#xD;
might not have, been a Bible.&#xD;
N1 ow, then," said'Mr. Judkins, "I&#xD;
usually make bargains in the church,&#xD;
as the most fitting place." Relieving&#xD;
&#xD;
I his hand of the candle by placing it on&#xD;
the desk, he continued, " Who's to be&#xD;
e married ?-yourself, eh ?"&#xD;
n    " Not now--not I-no, no 1" said Mr.&#xD;
Pike; "I'm rather too old for that, Mr.&#xD;
e Judkips."&#xD;
"Not at all-better late than never.&#xD;
, Bless you ! we marry gentlemen here&#xD;
t double your age. 'Tis very strange,&#xD;
f but I remark the old ones are always&#xD;
more eager after this sort of thing than&#xD;
, the young."&#xD;
"Well, the bridegroom, in the pre-&#xD;
sent case, is a young man, and the&#xD;
lady a few years younger than he."r&#xD;
"Is-the gentleman wealthy,?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Judkins; "we always square our&#xD;
. charges with the circumstances of the&#xD;
parties.  That's fair and just, I think&#xD;
-oh yes, we are honest men here."&#xD;
" I am sorry to say," observed Mr.&#xD;
- Pike, shaking his head, " that the&#xD;
young man is poor ; so you mast be&#xD;
as moderate in your charge as possi-&#xD;
ble."&#xD;
" But the lady, perhaps, is rich ?"&#xD;
"Poorer still-her father is in the&#xD;
Fleet."&#xD;
At this unwelcome intelligence, a&#xD;
shadow came over the countenance of&#xD;
Mr. Judkins; the huge head dropped&#xD;
a little 'as if in thought, and the blood-&#xD;
shot eyes half closed. " Bad--bad;&#xD;
however, friend, we must- make the&#xD;
best of it, and so I'll name my lowest&#xD;
price-ten shillings for myself, five&#xD;
shillings for the parson, and a half-&#xD;
crown each for the witness and brides-&#xD;
maid."°&#xD;
" Which just make a. pound," ex-&#xD;
claimed Mr, Pike, with a severe look.&#xD;
"I must say your terms are rather&#xD;
high."&#xD;
"Can't take less," said Mr. Judkins.&#xD;
" Higher than.I was led to expect."&#xD;
"We never lower our price when&#xD;
once named."&#xD;
;'Higher than those of the Estab-&#xD;
lished Church of England."&#xD;
" Of course, because we are more&#xD;
accommodating-can't say a shilling&#xD;
less."'&#xD;
"Hark'ee, my friend, I agree to your&#xD;
terms, if you will oblige me in one&#xD;
particular."&#xD;
"What is that ?"-&#xD;
" Canthe witness .and bridesmaid&#xD;
appear like a gentleman and lady ?",&#xD;
" Of course they can, if I lend-them&#xD;
clothes."&#xD;
" Thenlet them assume the dress and&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
air of foreigners, and speak broken En-&#xD;
glish."&#xD;
"What possible use can that be ?"&#xD;
"I will send a coach for them," con-&#xD;
tinued Mr. Pike; "they will drive to&#xD;
the lady's house in the- character of&#xD;
professional singers, and the bride-&#xD;
groom being with them, they will suc-&#xD;
ceed in getting the young lady quietly&#xD;
off."&#xD;
Mr. Judkins was remarkably quick&#xD;
in diving-into the meaning of every-&#xD;
thing which bore upon his peculiar&#xD;
line of business; 'e therefore readily&#xD;
comprehended the half-explained pro-&#xD;
ject of Pike.&#xD;
"Perhaps," said he, thoughtfully,&#xD;
"I sha'n't be able to spare the SWit-&#xD;
ness and bridesmaid: besides, there is&#xD;
the dressing of them up-the clothes,&#xD;
the mustaches, the gold chain, and the&#xD;
female turban-oh ! I must have more&#xD;
money for all this!"&#xD;
"I can't give more than the pound,"&#xD;
said Mr. Pike, firmly.&#xD;
"Must have more money," urged&#xD;
Judkins.&#xD;
Mr. Pike walked about with his&#xD;
hands in his pockets.   He himself&#xD;
would be called on to pay the pound,&#xD;
for Flemming, he knew, did not pos-&#xD;
sess so. much- money in the world.&#xD;
The thing was like drawing the blood&#xD;
from his veins-; but a bright thought&#xD;
now struck him: possibly,, on repre-&#xD;
sentation, Mr. Hartley might be in-&#xD;
clined to defray the expenses; yes, it&#xD;
was but reasonable, he thought, that&#xD;
the burden should fall on Hartley.&#xD;
Without further murmurs, then, he re-&#xD;
solved to meet the demands of Judkins.&#xD;
" That's like a gentleman," said the&#xD;
latter, as Mr. Pike consented to an&#xD;
increase of the fee. "We always work&#xD;
better when paid fairly-'tis human&#xD;
nature, sir. I'll meet your wishes in&#xD;
everything, and no doubt all will go&#xD;
off smooth and comfortable."&#xD;
"To-morrow, then," said the attor-&#xD;
ney, "the coach shall be here. But&#xD;
look you, suppose the girl is difficult to&#xD;
manage, and should swoon or shriek."&#xD;
"Oh, that's- nothing," observed Mr.&#xD;
Judkins; "'tis generally the case with&#xD;
our younger customers. Shrieks and&#xD;
other noises are rather common in our&#xD;
quarter ; the police, through custom,&#xD;
seldom take- notice of them. Ah ! we&#xD;
have gone through several rough jobs&#xD;
in our house, sir; so I do not much fear&#xD;
&#xD;
127&#xD;
&#xD;
of performing your little business.in a&#xD;
respectable and satisfactory manner."&#xD;
A half sovereign being placed in the&#xD;
broad palm of ~Mr. Judkins, to " bind&#xD;
the bargain," that worthy, with his&#xD;
flaring candle, preceded his visitor out&#xD;
of the church. Mr. Pike followed at&#xD;
his heels,.and the next minute, stealthi-&#xD;
ly as a fox, glided through the half-&#xD;
opened door of the notable house of&#xD;
mock-marriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ICTIM.IS LURED INTO THE SNARE.&#xD;
Sr. PAUL's bad just struck six, yet&#xD;
it was already dark, for the month of&#xD;
October' had begun-a period of the&#xD;
year peculiarly cheerless in our great&#xD;
metropolis.&#xD;
A  hackney coach, -slowly passing;&#xD;
down the Old -Bailey, entered Fleet-&#xD;
lane, which contracted, thoroughfare&#xD;
just admitted of its progress, the&#xD;
wheels extending almost from curb-&#xD;
stone to curbstone. The=vehicle rcon-&#xD;
tained a man in foreign attire, having on&#xD;
a thickly-braided frock-coat, a hat very&#xD;
high in the pole, and wearing a massy&#xD;
gilt, chain, while, his mustaches were&#xD;
large and black as jet. By his side&#xD;
sat a woman, finely but tawdrily-&#xD;
dressed; yet her robe of staring col-&#xD;
ors, huge turban, and sundry mosaic&#xD;
and glass ornaments might be in keep.-&#xD;
ing with the general costume of a thitd-&#xD;
rate Italian cantatrice.&#xD;
These-two persons were Signor and&#xD;
Signora Ruboni: they called themselves&#xD;
brother and sister, and the part they&#xD;
had to perform had been fully explained&#xD;
to them.&#xD;
The coach stopped at the house where&#xD;
Hester lodged, and the driver, knowing&#xD;
his business, without any intimation&#xD;
from the parties he carried, knocked at&#xD;
the door. Presently, Flemming, made&#xD;
his appearance. In, spite of his,:en-&#xD;
deavors to be calm, there was something&#xD;
hurried in his manner, and.a wildness&#xD;
flashed in his eyes which singularly&#xD;
contrasted with the quiet, cold self&#xD;
possession of Signor and Signora Ru .&#xD;
boni.&#xD;
" Is the lady ready ?" asked the sig-&#xD;
nor.&#xD;
Flemming replied that she would be&#xD;
with them in two or three minutes.&#xD;

&#xD;
HE'S-TER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
"There is no time to lose," said the&#xD;
signora, in good English; casting a sig-&#xD;
nificant look at the hunchback.&#xD;
But even at the last moment Hester&#xD;
hesitated, for she dreaded appearing in-&#xD;
public.  A timidity and a shrinking&#xD;
now seized her, and it was with diffi-&#xD;
culty that her trembling hands could&#xD;
arrange her hair, or place on the last&#xD;
article of her dress. Flemming knocked&#xD;
at her door ; she would come instantly;&#xD;
he retired, but again returned, saying&#xD;
that the concert conmenced at half-past&#xD;
seven, and they ought to be early at&#xD;
their posts.  '&#xD;
"Shall I abandon it?" said Hester&#xD;
to herself. Then the thoughts of the&#xD;
money, and the hope of making more&#xD;
in furtherance of her great design, rose&#xD;
in her mind, lent her energy, and set-&#xD;
tled her determination.&#xD;
"Signor and Signora Ruboni send&#xD;
their compliments, and hope you will&#xD;
not be much longer," said Flemming.&#xD;
This was sufficient.. Hester left her&#xD;
room, and, her music-book under her&#xD;
arm, hurried down the;atairs. Flem-&#xD;
ming, in silence, assisted her into the&#xD;
coach, sprang in himself, and the&#xD;
vehicle drove off.&#xD;
They proceeded through Fleet-street&#xD;
and the Strand. The heart of Hester&#xD;
was ,too full to admit of her speaking&#xD;
much, but she addressed a few words&#xD;
to the female at her side in reference&#xD;
to the approaching concert ; the signora&#xD;
was one of the. singers, so Flemming&#xD;
had, informed Hester, and,- residing&#xD;
with her brother in the city, had kindly&#xD;
agreed to take the two friends in the&#xD;
coach hired for the occasion. Hester,-&#xD;
however, was sorry to find that the lady&#xD;
in the bright turban could speak no&#xD;
language but Italian, which she herself&#xD;
did not understand; all the signora&#xD;
could do was to nod her head, and&#xD;
make gestures with her gloved hands.&#xD;
Though her features in the lamp-light&#xD;
were only- faintly distinguished, she&#xD;
appeared to be a remarkably coarse&#xD;
.and vulgar woman.&#xD;
The signor talked in broken English,&#xD;
his voice sharp, and his manner abrupt.&#xD;
But what struck Hester as being most&#xD;
strange, was the complete taciturnity,&#xD;
of Flemming; he sat in a corner of the&#xD;
vehicle; =his- arms were folded, his&#xD;
cheeks were deadly pale, while his eye-&#xD;
brows were contracted until they met&#xD;
each other.  His whole countenance&#xD;
&#xD;
H ES TER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
expressed intense thought and inexpli-&#xD;
cable sorrow.&#xD;
Hester regarded him with feelings of&#xD;
the liveliest interest and pity.&#xD;
" You are very silent, Mr. Flemming.&#xD;
Does anything perplex you connected&#xD;
with the concert? I hope I have not,&#xD;
by my little delay, caused 'the party&#xD;
inconvenience."&#xD;
Flemming returned no answer, but&#xD;
Signor Ruboni did. Hester shrank&#xD;
from this man with an instindtive feel-&#xD;
ing of dislike. He might be an Italian&#xD;
singer, she thought, but certainly one&#xD;
of the lowest description; in spite of,&#xD;
his gold chain and frogged coat, he re-,&#xD;
sembled a brigand rather than a gentle&#xD;
professor of Melody's divine art. - She&#xD;
leant back, and remained silent for&#xD;
several minutes ; but again glancing at-&#xD;
the sad countenance of Flemming, she&#xD;
could not resist addressing him.&#xD;
"Nay, rouse yourself, and let us talk&#xD;
of the parts we' have to go through. Of&#xD;
course I feel anxious and uncertain as.&#xD;
to my success, having never sung in&#xD;
public before, Mr. Flemming, will you&#xD;
not speak to me ?-are you ill?"&#xD;
He heard her now, and started. The"&#xD;
color rushed :to his faded cheek, and&#xD;
light beamed in his eye. He stooped&#xD;
forward, and seized her hand --&#xD;
"Forgive me-forgive me! I am a&#xD;
fiend, but when the storm is passed, the&#xD;
sunshine will again smile. I am not so&#xD;
black in soul as I may-appear. I will&#xD;
protect you-I will devote myself to you&#xD;
forever-Ionly ask you to forgive me."&#xD;
Hester was astonished   at  these&#xD;
strange in herent words, and almost&#xD;
began to ink that Flemming's intel-&#xD;
lect was disordered.  The unconcern&#xD;
and apathy of the two Italians might&#xD;
be attributable, she imagined, to their&#xD;
slight acquaintance with the English&#xD;
language. Flemming,bythe lamp-light,&#xD;
perceived the expression of wonder&#xD;
which her countenance betrayed.-&#xD;
" Ahi I strangely forget myself," he&#xD;
said, appearing to awake to a conscious-&#xD;
ness .of his position. "I believe I was&#xD;
half-dreaming, or thinking of a scene&#xD;
in some play. Well, your songs-you&#xD;
will get through them with applause.&#xD;
How slowly the coach-moves ! We have&#xD;
only reached Charing-cross."&#xD;
The driver, however, had been flog-&#xD;
ging his horses to a rapid pace. The&#xD;
anxiety of Flemmingpand the fever of&#xD;
his mind, might well cause -all motion&#xD;
to appear -tardy. Hester glanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
129&#xD;
&#xD;
through the window, but she perceived&#xD;
now that, instead of turning to the&#xD;
right towards Regent-street, they were&#xD;
proceeding down Whitehall to West-&#xD;
minster.&#xD;
"Mr. Flemming, the coachman has&#xD;
misunderstood your order; he is taking&#xD;
us in a wrong direction."     -&#xD;
"-Oh, no, miss," said Signor Ruboni.&#xD;
"The concert is to be held at the&#xD;
Hanover-square Rooms, is it not?",&#xD;
"Yes," said Flemming;- "but, dear&#xD;
Hester--amiss Somerset-I, I had for-&#xD;
gotten to tell you that we go to West-&#xD;
minster first." He suddenly thrust&#xD;
his- head out of the window, and de-&#xD;
sired the coachman to drive faster ;&#xD;
upon which the whip was heard to-play&#xD;
around the horses' sides, and they&#xD;
broke into a gallop.&#xD;
" This is extraordinary," said Hester;&#xD;
" why go to Westminster ?"&#xD;
"e have agreed to take up a lady&#xD;
there-a singer-to save her the coach-&#xD;
hire)" said Flemming, shading his face;&#xD;
"she lives in a street behind the ah-&#xD;
bey."&#xD;
"Yes, and when she gets in, I shall-&#xD;
turn outside on the box," observed Sig-&#xD;
nor Ruboni.&#xD;
Hester appeared satisfied, and yet,&#xD;
unsuspecting as her nature was, the&#xD;
vulgar manners of the Italians, and&#xD;
the singular demeanor of Flemming,&#xD;
together with their- present route to a&#xD;
district so far from Hanover-square,&#xD;
raised feelings of surprise and mistrust&#xD;
in her mind. Swiftly turning out of&#xD;
Parliament-street, with the abbey on-&#xD;
their left hand, and proceeding down&#xD;
Great George-street, and along the west&#xD;
side of St. Margaret's Churchyard, they&#xD;
soon entered the region, where squalor,&#xD;
idleness, and low iniquity begin.&#xD;
" It is nearly seven o'clock," observ-&#xD;
ed Flemming.&#xD;
"We are in the Broadway," said&#xD;
Signor Ruboni; "we sha'n't be long&#xD;
now."&#xD;
Few lamps were seen, except in the&#xD;
immediate neighborhood of the gin-&#xD;
palaces. All -shops of a respectable&#xD;
appearance had vanished ; costermong-&#xD;
ers, small grocers, dealers in marine&#xD;
stores, and owners of coal-sheds, being&#xD;
the chief tradesmen in the locality.-&#xD;
Groups of people stood here and there&#xD;
on the pavement, men leaning against&#xD;
posts smoking, and women without&#xD;
bonnets discussing domestic questions&#xD;
before the spirit-shops. Now a fight&#xD;
&#xD;
was got up, the crowd nearly blocking&#xD;
the way ; and now the shrieks of fe-&#xD;
males frenzied with drink, and tearing&#xD;
each other's hair, rang in the ears.&#xD;
The scene, although  Hester'caught&#xD;
only a passing glimpse of it as the&#xD;
coach hurried along, excited in. her&#xD;
strong sensations of fear.&#xD;
"I hope we shall soon pass out of&#xD;
this dreadful neighborhood," she ob-&#xD;
served to- Flemming. "Where does&#xD;
the' lady who accompanies us to the,&#xD;
concert live ?"&#xD;
-"Not far off-we have nearly reach-&#xD;
ed the house."&#xD;
'-Oh ! surely she° cannot reside here.&#xD;
Fleet-lane, where I lodge, though mean&#xD;
and wretched, is quiet and retired-&#xD;
this place is horrible."&#xD;
The coach dashed down a narrow&#xD;
turning on the left; the noise of the&#xD;
more populous streets was left behind,&#xD;
yet what the place gained in one re-&#xD;
spect by the change, it lost in another.&#xD;
The aspect of the houses herewas cheer-&#xD;
less, dirty, anddesolate; a-few wretched&#xD;
beings in rags moved to and fro, and&#xD;
even the spot seemed forsaken by dogs&#xD;
and cats, as though aware they could&#xD;
find no food in that poverty-stricken&#xD;
region.&#xD;
The vehicle jolted over the rough&#xD;
stones. It reached, at last, the myste-&#xD;
rious little street already-described in&#xD;
our pages; the street of thieves, and&#xD;
their depots for stolen merchandise--&#xD;
the street where was situated the silent&#xD;
house of mock-marriages.&#xD;
"Here we are, then," said Signor&#xD;
Ruboni; " mam'selle will be anxiously&#xD;
expecting us."&#xD;
"How dark -it is!^ I do not see a&#xD;
single lamp," observed Hester, trem-&#xD;
bling now for the first time, and shrink-&#xD;
ing into a corner.&#xD;
"Oh, there are plenty of lamps,"&#xD;
said the signor:,"only they have not&#xD;
lit them yet."&#xD;
"Mr. Flemming," cried Hester, turn-&#xD;
ing quickly to the hunchback, " there&#xD;
is something wrong-there is some-&#xD;
thing in all this which I do not com-&#xD;
prehend. Tell me the meaning of it,&#xD;
I beseech you."&#xD;
But Flemming seemed to have re-&#xD;
lapsed into his former state of abstrac-&#xD;
tion and'stupor.&#xD;
"Mark Flemming-dear Mark," said&#xD;
Hester,in a tone of entreaty, ''"speak to&#xD;
me--I am in your hands-you-you&#xD;
are my protector."&#xD;

CHAPTER 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERST Is IN THE PowER Or&#xD;
* THE HUNCHBACK.&#xD;
THEY carried Hester into the room&#xD;
where the mock-marriages were per-&#xD;
formed in the house at Westminster,&#xD;
and there, by means of strong remedies,&#xD;
they succeeded in restoring her to'-con-&#xD;
sciousness. Opening her eyes, she found&#xD;
herself on one of the wooden forms in&#xD;
frontof the rude desk, and the group&#xD;
had gathered around her, as if anxiously&#xD;
awaiting her, recovery.  Conspicuous,&#xD;
stood Mr. Judkins, a smile upon the&#xD;
coarse mouth, that was half concealed&#xD;
by the large red whiskers. The coun-&#xD;
terfeit Italian singer had taken off his&#xD;
mustaches, and the signora had doffed&#xD;
her false hair and bright turban. A&#xD;
little man, with a brushed-up foretop&#xD;
onz a bullet head, and dressed in a dirty&#xD;
white robe, held a book and a glass of&#xD;
water in his hand. This individual&#xD;
represented the parson-the kind qui-&#xD;
eter of the consciences of country ladies,&#xD;
and all those who were weak enough to&#xD;
be enticed into a belief that a ceremony,&#xD;
performed by him, would sanction their&#xD;
runaway loves.&#xD;
Hester did not seem to notice any of&#xD;
these persons; her eyes were fixed on&#xD;
Flemming, who'stood half bowed down&#xD;
.by a sense of shame, and half exulting&#xD;
in the prize he had won. But the first&#xD;
shock of fear being past, Hester ex-&#xD;
hibited a singular firmness: when&#xD;
placed in situations of danger, real and&#xD;
understood, woman sometimes will re-&#xD;
tain her presence of mind, while man,&#xD;
similarly circumstanced, will by no&#xD;
means act the hero.-&#xD;
"Mark Flemming, I address myself&#xD;
to you; speak the truth ; falsehood will&#xD;
no longer avail you, for I understand&#xD;
all. Vile has the scheme been to lure&#xD;
me to this horrible place, and you have&#xD;
been the contriver of it-you have con-&#xD;
nected yourself with these miserable&#xD;
men."&#xD;
"Pshaw !'' said Mr. Judkins, "we&#xD;
t      are not miserable men."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ay, the deed rests with me!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Flemming.-; "my excuse is-"&#xD;
" Can such villanyfind an excuse?&#xD;
And this is your protection--this is&#xD;
your professed love !"&#xD;
"Love!" cried Flemming, drawing&#xD;
close to her ; "that tame word but ill&#xD;
expresses what I feel. Mine is a wor-&#xD;
ship,a wild adoration that would sacri-&#xD;
fice - at its shrine - self-esteem, peace,&#xD;
earthly hope, all things. I am like the&#xD;
poor devotee of the-East, driven on by&#xD;
his fervor, ready to commit all-excesses,&#xD;
and to cast himself at length beneath&#xD;
the crushing wheels of his Juggernaut."&#xD;
-1 You would also sacrifice me?"&#xD;
":No, no ; I have endeavored to dream&#xD;
that you might be happy. I loved you;&#xD;
I threw myself at your feet ; I was re-&#xD;
j ected ; but I grant your refusal was&#xD;
natural, and such as my mocking fel-&#xD;
low-men would approve of.- But the&#xD;
hunchback had a soul,though repulsive&#xD;
the clay in which it was enshrined.&#xD;
Despair goaded me on; I would possess&#xD;
you, reckless of{the means by which I&#xD;
accomplished my purpose. Hope whis-&#xD;
pered, that when your spirit should&#xD;
know my spirit, when habit should&#xD;
have familiarized you. with all which&#xD;
now appears hideous to your{ eyes,&#xD;
esteem might be succeeded by interest,&#xD;
and interest at last beget love?&#xD;
The fire of passion in the eyes of the&#xD;
speaker struggled with the softer light&#xD;
of that deep melancholyfeeling habitual&#xD;
to him. After a short'pause, during&#xD;
which Judkins and his associates be-&#xD;
trayed much impatience, Flemming&#xD;
continued:&#xD;
"Thus have I had recourse to strata-&#xD;
gem, dark hellish deceit, convinced that&#xD;
by no other means I could win you.&#xD;
Pardon me, then; my, great love is-my&#xD;
plea, the only excuse I have-to offer for&#xD;
my sin, my cruelty, my madness. Con-&#xD;
sent to be mine-link your lot toxiine-&#xD;
place your happiness in my hands-I&#xD;
swear to be all, ay, more to you than&#xD;
man ever was to woman;before. Dear,&#xD;
dear Hester, listen to my prayer !"&#xD;
"Now, young lady," said Mr. Jud-&#xD;
kins, advancing, "wethink quite enough&#xD;

&#xD;
has been said; the young man can't&#xD;
speak fairer, so -marry him quietly,&#xD;
there's a good girl. Mr. Bumpus," he&#xD;
added, addressing the parson, "you&#xD;
had better, I think, go to the desk and&#xD;
begin."&#xD;
There was much that was ludicrous&#xD;
in the scene, and yet the half-lighted&#xD;
miserable appearance of the room, the&#xD;
savage countenances of the men, and&#xD;
the compulsory nature of an act which&#xD;
might lead tothe ruin of one who, had&#xD;
no one there to protect her, and who,&#xD;
if she shrieked, might'shriek in vain-&#xD;
these had something in them fearful&#xD;
and horrible..&#xD;
Stay ! your mummery is useless,"&#xD;
cried Hester, springing up from  the&#xD;
form on which they had placed her.&#xD;
"You--are mistaken," said Mr. Jud-&#xD;
kins;- "we have married hundreds of&#xD;
ladies here, I assure you, some from&#xD;
the country and some of the town.&#xD;
'Tisquite right;:you will be man and&#xD;
wife when you leave this place ;'tis my&#xD;
duty to tell you so ; however," added&#xD;
the, considerate gentleman, "if you&#xD;
should like to do as they do at Gretna&#xD;
Green, you can,'by and by, be married&#xD;
again in the regularChurch of England,&#xD;
just by way of satisfaction. -'Now, Mr.&#xD;
Bumpus."&#xD;
"False and wretched man !" cried&#xD;
Hester, with desperate resolution; "free&#xD;
will and mutual consent hallow the&#xD;
union of those who fly to the North;&#xD;
here fraud is used with force ; you&#xD;
commit a. crime which the law will&#xD;
severely punish."&#xD;
The heavy eyes of Judkins grew in-&#xD;
flamed, and he muttered an oath.&#xD;
"You are rather impertinent, mfy&#xD;
dear," he- said; "but there, never&#xD;
mind;- we dogi't take much account of&#xD;
words here;.we epcuse you; but don't&#xD;
let us have a rough business of it, I&#xD;
beg; -it will be wasting strength and&#xD;
time to no purpose."&#xD;
These coarse threats, which seemed&#xD;
to imply more:than was expressed,&#xD;
made the girl shudder;-her blood ran&#xD;
cold- ;:all, color forsook her'face, and&#xD;
she sank on the' form as if overcome,&#xD;
but presently rose again on her feet.&#xD;
Mr. Flemming hear me! II appeal&#xD;
to -you,I address-myself to your better&#xD;
nature, if there is anything generous,&#xD;
left there. You perceive my situation;&#xD;
that I am in your power, weak, - and&#xD;
without help, relying -only on God and&#xD;
my own innocence. Would you compel&#xD;
&#xD;
me into marriage? Would you possess&#xD;
me without a particle of my affection? I&#xD;
have esteemed you, respected you, loved&#xD;
you as a brother; shall I not now, if&#xD;
you proceed to this length,despise and&#xD;
abhor you? and will you not, by de-&#xD;
stroying my hopes and peace, fix a&#xD;
pang in your conscience, and impose a&#xD;
burden on your own soul so long as you&#xD;
live ? Think of this, pause, and trem-&#xD;
ble f.&#xD;
The beautiful girl stood a4 her full&#xD;
height ; one arm was extended, her&#xD;
eyes were raised to heaven, and her&#xD;
disordered hair fell back over her shoul-&#xD;
ders in a wavelike shining mass. Thete&#xD;
was an energy, a wild majesty in her&#xD;
manner, which seemed to awe even the&#xD;
black and daring spirits around, for no&#xD;
one spoke, and each gazed steadfastly&#xD;
on her. Such is the influence virtue,&#xD;
which is of heaven, willfsometimes ox-&#xD;
ercise over crime, which is of hell.'&#xD;
" But you will not, Mr. Flemming,"&#xD;
continued Hester, relapsing into a tone.&#xD;
of entreaty more natural to her wo-&#xD;
manly nature-" you will not commit&#xD;
this cruelty, this sin. Think of my,&#xD;
father now in prison-what will be his&#xD;
sufferings added to his present misery,&#xD;
when he hears of this outrage on his&#xD;
child ! Think of my mother, whose mind&#xD;
sorrow -arid misfortune have wrecked,&#xD;
and let her very madness plead on my -&#xD;
behalf! Mark!Mark !" she cried,seizing&#xD;
him by the arm, hanging on his clothes,&#xD;
and looking up into his face in an agony&#xD;
beyond any grief yet manifested by her,&#xD;
"think, too, of' one now far distant,&#xD;
whose story I have told you-to whom&#xD;
the-heart of the child was given, and&#xD;
my after vows have all been pledged-&#xD;
if you love me, think of my love, my&#xD;
despair, and have mercy. May a God&#xD;
of justice and-of pity soften your soul!&#xD;
May the darkness depart which now&#xD;
shadows you, and the sunlightof honor&#xD;
and goodness light again your noble&#xD;
nature! Mr. Flemming !-dearMark !-&#xD;
listen to my supplication-may I not&#xD;
plead in vain-hear me--protect me-=&#xD;
save me-have mercy-mercy!"&#xD;
Gradually, as she held by his clothes,&#xD;
she sank lower and lower, her face still&#xD;
upturned to his, and her eyes now brim-&#xD;
ming with tears ; and thus she knelt on&#xD;
the floor before him. Flemming saw her&#xD;
on her knees, but did not stoop or move.&#xD;
Her fate might be said to quiver in -the&#xD;
balance, and the ruler of her destiny&#xD;
was that deformed being in whose.,&#xD;

CHAPTEI II.&#xD;
THE FATE OF HESTER IS DECIDED.&#xD;
THERE is no fiercer trial, no more&#xD;
violent excitement to which the mind&#xD;
can be subjected, than the contests of&#xD;
antagonistic passions ;,ad of all other&#xD;
emotions, perhaps, those raised by the,&#xD;
struggle of the two reat principles of&#xD;
od and evil, are the strongest. Mark&#xD;
Flemming was an illustration -of, this&#xD;
fact. We have seen him during his&#xD;
connection' with Pike in a state of con-&#xD;
stant and painful vacillation. .Like a&#xD;
penddluni, he swung to that -side, and&#xD;
stillreturned. Like Mohammed's coffin,&#xD;
he wasphalf in the heaven of honor and&#xD;
virtue, and half on the earth of crime.&#xD;
The evil at length predominated ;-he&#xD;
had been vanquished, and came hither&#xD;
with his victim.&#xD;
Now, at the eleventh hour, roused&#xD;
by the appeal of Hester, and stung by&#xD;
remorse, his resolves were shaken. The&#xD;
angel of good had flown back again to&#xD;
dispute the mastery of his heart-all'&#xD;
his old struggle was renewed.&#xD;
What passed within his breast might&#xD;
- not have been divined 'by the expres-&#xD;
sion of his countenance, for, in, the,&#xD;
presence -of Judkins and his men, he&#xD;
struggled hard tosuppress what fain&#xD;
would have burst forth, 'and to assume&#xD;
a tranquillity he was far from feeling.&#xD;
He regarded Hester for several minutes&#xD;
in profound silence; then, turning from&#xD;
her, abruptly walked across the room,&#xD;
'and back again.' Judkins stared, and&#xD;
the little parson grew restless and-un-&#xD;
easy ; probably the latter feared. after&#xD;
all he might lose his expected fee.&#xD;
"Come,. young man," said Mr. Jud-&#xD;
kins, "we can't stop any longer; we've&#xD;
heard all the speeches out now:.it's&#xD;
quite time the affair was settled. Take&#xD;
up your bride from the floor, and bring&#xD;
her forward."     '&#xD;
Flemming advanced tothe man, and&#xD;
said, in a husky tone,&#xD;
"Have you iron in your breast? Is&#xD;
your blood ice ?"&#xD;
Mr. Judkina broke into loud laugh-&#xD;
ter.'7&#xD;
&#xD;
138&#xD;
&#xD;
"What! puling are you, my doughty&#xD;
knight ?  Come, let us have no non-&#xD;
sense. Surely you won't listen to the&#xD;
little-speeches of a child like that?-we&#xD;
are used to such things here-ohI yes,&#xD;
tears, and sobs, and all those fine sen-&#xD;
timental things-but.we never listen&#xD;
to them; we know our duty, and act&#xD;
up to it. Here, I'll carry the lass for-&#xD;
ward, for I see you.need help. dMr.&#xD;
Bumpus, go into, the desk, and begin.&#xD;
Why, we shall be all night marrying&#xD;
the young people, at this rate."&#xD;
s-Mr. Judkins spoke, he laid: his&#xD;
rough hand on7TIester, with the inten-&#xD;
tion of dragging her to the front of'the&#xD;
desk, in which the parson had stationed&#xD;
himself. Suddenly Judkins was thrust&#xD;
aside, and felt-a hand at his throat.&#xD;
"1Forbear, ruffian! Add not the pol-&#xD;
lution of thy touch to the other indiggi-&#xD;
ties this lady has suffered."&#xD;
Flemming, though small as well as&#xD;
deformed, was possessed of extraordi-&#xD;
nary vigor: the Herculean frame of&#xD;
Judkins staggered, and, unprepared for&#xD;
the sudden attack, he was borne against&#xD;
a wooden form, over which, he stum-&#xD;
bled, sinking on one knee. -He gained&#xD;
his. legs again, muttering an oath; hut&#xD;
the giant was tioo conscious of his own&#xD;
superior strength'to take any vengeance&#xD;
on the stripling.&#xD;
"That was cleverly done, I must say;&#xD;
Who would have thought those thin&#xD;
fingers and spider legs of thine could&#xD;
manage such a feat ! - Don't fear; I'm&#xD;
not in a passion: we never give way to&#xD;
anger here, for there's nothing got by&#xD;
it. However, my man, what do you&#xD;
mean?, I am your friend, and only&#xD;
want to do you;a service."&#xD;
"That service is no -longer needed,"&#xD;
said Flemming, with compressed.lips.&#xD;
"Not? Strange 1 Why, my parson&#xD;
hasn't married you yet-of course you&#xD;
need our services?"&#xD;
Flemming turned ' towards Hester.&#xD;
Though the struggled ceased-&#xD;
though the demon was quelled-great&#xD;
was the agitation he betrayed. Oh !&#xD;
hard was it to surrender all which his&#xD;
heart clung to--ifficult to renounce&#xD;
that for the possession of which he had&#xD;
bartered his peace. and his honor but&#xD;
his- resolve was taken; and his life&#xD;
thenceforth-mustbe; a .blank and a&#xD;

performed ere it was too -late. The&#xD;

&#xD;
choking of the threat subdued,- and&#xD;
the eye assumed its wonted expression&#xD;
of thoughtful sorrow.1&#xD;
"Miss Somerset, to speak to you of&#xD;
my repentance and remorse were idle;&#xD;
idle also to asks you to forgive me-to&#xD;
excuse my conduct on account. of my&#xD;
hopeless and miserable love. Enough-r&#xD;
that I have awaked to a sense of right ;&#xD;
that I am- an altered man. I expect&#xD;
not your pardon, then, and I ask not&#xD;
your pity. You, are free. You shall&#xD;
leave this place untainted, unmolested.&#xD;
Heaven and the angel of your own&#xD;
pure nature have been your guardians,&#xD;
and ever, ever may they protect you!"&#xD;
Hester was" unable to return -her&#xD;
thanks in words, or express the deep&#xD;
gushing joy which overpowered her.&#xD;
Impelled'by the feelings uppermost&#xD;
that moment in her heart, she- threw&#xD;
herself into Flemming's arms, and the&#xD;
repentantiman bentover her, feeling the&#xD;
full satisfaction arising from the per-&#xD;
formance of a virtuous deed-; and how&#xD;
immeasurably'greater is the happiness&#xD;
it gives than any wild, unholy bliss re-&#xD;
sulting from the indulgence of crime!&#xD;
Both remained silent; the low breath-&#xD;
ings of Hester only being heard, while&#xD;
scalding tears trickled down the cheeks&#xD;
of Flemming.&#xD;
As Judkins witnessed the scene, a&#xD;
black scowl gathered on his brow; he&#xD;
crossed his arms on his brawny chest,&#xD;
and looked menacingly on their.&#xD;
"This is all very well for you, my&#xD;
friends, no doubt; but if you will be a&#xD;
fool, Master Hunchback, I am'not. I&#xD;
look to interests and the security of&#xD;
my house. You don't leave us quite yet&#xD;
-no, no; you're both in my power!"&#xD;
What' mean you, villain ?" cried&#xD;
Flemming; "would you offer us vio-&#xD;
lence?".&#xD;
As he spoke, he sprang: out into the&#xD;
room, as - if preparing for' a defence ;&#xD;
the next instant he caught;up a short.&#xD;
iron bar which he saw lying onthe&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
"AhaI" 'exclaimedJudkins, "you're&#xD;
arming yourself, are you? A very&#xD;
good precaution; but, look you, Master&#xD;
hunchback I can'do the same thing."&#xD;
The man with the ferocious' bulldog&#xD;
head dived his hand'into the pocket of&#xD;
his=fustian coat, and brought to light&#xD;
a large' horse-pistol;'he deliberately.&#xD;
cocked it, and presented-it at the head&#xD;
of Flemming.&#xD;
"Take care,4tis loaded," said Juda&#xD;
&#xD;
kins. "Now say, my lad, who has the&#xD;
best of it?"&#xD;
"Be- calm, Mt. Flemming !" cried&#xD;
Hester, shivering with fear; " do what&#xD;
ever he tells you."&#xD;
"Fire, scoundreli!-I-reck not. What&#xD;
is life now to me?",&#xD;
'"Nay," said Judkins, "we don't do&#xD;
these things here, unless driven to it.&#xD;
I only want you to know what we can&#xD;
do. Quietness and a fair living are&#xD;
all we'ask. Well, you've altered your&#xD;
mind, and won't marry the girl-good ;&#xD;
I care nothing for that; I only demand&#xD;
two things-secrecy and mhy money.&#xD;
Swear, young man and woman, that&#xD;
you won't inform against our house."&#xD;
" If you will let us go," said Hester,&#xD;
in her terror, "we will swear."&#xD;
The required promise was given.&#xD;
" However," continued Mr. Judkins,&#xD;
"these oaths are just for form's sake,&#xD;
and I accept them; but my best secur-&#xD;
ity is the full certainty you must have&#xD;
that, if you betray us, your lies won't&#xD;
be worth a week's purchase."'&#xD;
Hester, at this cool intimation Of&#xD;
murder, shuddered,&#xD;
"And now,",added Mr. Judkins, "for&#xD;
the money. You must pay exactly the&#xD;
same sum as if the marriage had been&#xD;
performed;,for-we've had all the trou-&#xD;
ble of it."&#xD;
"What is your demand ?" asked&#xD;
Flemming.&#xD;
" I've received ten shillings 6n ac&#xD;
count of the business--I want twenty&#xD;
more ; this was the agreement.",&#xD;
The money having been paid, Flem-&#xD;
ming was permitted to conduct Hester&#xD;
to the coach; he placed her inside, but&#xD;
feeling now his own unworthiness, and&#xD;
that the tie even of friendship must be&#xD;
severed between them, he himself did&#xD;
not accompany her. The, driver, who'&#xD;
was to have proceeded a few miles into&#xD;
the country, was not a little surprised at&#xD;
receiving orders to return to Fleet-lane;&#xD;
and there, in a brief time, Hester, with&#xD;
a heart full of gratitude -to-'Heaven,&#xD;
found herself in safety at her old lodg-&#xD;

the issue of the affair, to his mother.&#xD;
The blind woman, at first, bitterly con-&#xD;
demned his conduct; but her heart be-&#xD;

she could only mourn over the unfor-&#xD;

He quitted the house; whither he went&#xD;
none knew, but days elapsed and no&#xD;
tidings were heard of him.&#xD;

my toy ? He is my all-my more than&#xD;
life. Oh! let people call him deformed,&#xD;
and regard him as a monster ; to me he&#xD;
is passing beautiful. You know not&#xD;
the mother's yearning to her offspring ;&#xD;
how lovely to her the unloved and de-&#xD;
spised can be, or you would pity me !"&#xD;
She bent her head before Hester;,her&#xD;
hair wat prematurely gray, not with&#xD;
age=but sorrow ; her thin pallid face,&#xD;
once beautiful, expressed anguish, yet&#xD;
her sightless eyes shed no tears-their&#xD;
fount was dry. Hester took her hand,&#xD;
and endeavored to console her.&#xD;
"I pity you, Mrs. Flemming; my&#xD;
hert would be of stone if it did not,&#xD;
indeed, bleed for you. I allow that&#xD;
this man, this villain whom you call&#xD;
Jones, by urging on your son, is.guilt-&#xD;
ier than he. The description which&#xD;
Mr. Flemming has given you of him&#xD;
convinces me his name is not Jones--&#xD;
he is a bitter enemy to my father. Oh!&#xD;
when will this miserable being cease&#xD;
to persecute us?"&#xD;
"Promise me- again," said Mrs.&#xD;
Flemnming ; "promise me that you will&#xD;
take-no steps against my son, so as to&#xD;
expose him to the penalties of the law.&#xD;
AW! .girl, I will tell you," added the&#xD;
blind woman, seizing the arm of Hes-&#xD;
ter, while her face assumed an unac-&#xD;
countable expression ; "you know not&#xD;
who he is-what he is-my secret I&#xD;
have kept for long years -shame,&#xD;
shame has sealed my lips; but now,&#xD;
to'render him service, and obtain for&#xD;
him a pardon, the, truth shall be di-&#xD;
vulged, at least to you. Bend nearer,-&#xD;
child, for my voice fails me. Mark&#xD;
Flemming"-she continued to speak&#xD;
in low tones, an interval between each&#xD;
word-" is your blood relative-he is&#xD;
of the .famil- the ancient -family-of&#xD;
Brookland hall P"&#xD;
Hester started back, incredulity and&#xD;
amazement depicted in her counte-&#xD;
nance.&#xD;
&#xD;
185&#xD;
&#xD;
"Impossible! I have no sister, no&#xD;
brother, no relation living except ir.&#xD;
Hartley; and he and my father are the&#xD;
last of their line."&#xD;
" Believe me, or believe me not; I&#xD;
can say no more. 'Pardon him     in&#xD;
whose veins runs the blood of your&#xD;
father's family."&#xD;
"On account of your own lonely&#xD;
situation, and your' own sorrows, I&#xD;
grant all you require..- The past is&#xD;
forgotten; your son shall receive no&#xD;
injury through my means."&#xD;
The blind woman thanked, blessed&#xD;
her, and returned to her solitary room.&#xD;
There she sat by the hearth, whisper-&#xD;
ing the name of Mark; it was all the&#xD;
happiness which she seemed to have.&#xD;
Then taking his -violin fromthe wall,&#xD;
she touched tremulously those strings&#xD;
from which her son had been wont to&#xD;
draw such sweet inspiring sounds; and&#xD;
thus she would remain for hours, think-&#xD;
ing, .sighing, but never weeping-the&#xD;
mother with the broken heart.&#xD;
"I must know all; nothing shall be&#xD;
hidden from me !" cried Mr:'Somerset,&#xD;
vehemently, as Hester disclosed to him&#xD;
a few of the incidents which had re-&#xD;
cently occurred. She softened the tale,&#xD;
and endeavored to render her position&#xD;
less fearful than in reality it had been ;&#xD;
but the father saw through the little&#xD;
artifice, and understood her motive.&#xD;
Overcome by his importunities, and&#xD;
yielding to his command, Hester con-&#xD;
cealed the facts no longer. The first&#xD;
impulse of Mr. Somerset was to thank&#xD;
Heaven for the. preservation -of his&#xD;
child ; and like the Oriental, who ne-&#xD;
ver hesitates to kneel,, whether it be&#xD;
in the street or the desert, to address&#xD;
his God-in this far more devout than&#xD;
the Christian of Europe-he dropped&#xD;
on his knees on the stone'floor of the&#xD;
room. --Fervently and audibly he offer-&#xD;
ed up his thanks, and Hester, stooping&#xD;
close beside 'hir, followed the words&#xD;
he uttered in her own sweet angelic&#xD;
whispers.&#xD;
That was a scene rarely witnessed&#xD;
within the walls of such a 'den 4as the&#xD;
Fleet -rison. A few. yards off there&#xD;
was uproarious mirth, and in the neigh-&#xD;
boring rooms drinking' and rioting&#xD;
went forward ; while across the yard,&#xD;
or sounding from the lobbies, oaths&#xD;
might have been heard, or shouts of&#xD;
abuse from parties in fierce contention.&#xD;

you. Of course I, in my office of turn-&#xD;
key, speak to all--that's nothing."&#xD;
"Now, Reuben, I thought you knew&#xD;
me better. I suppose you mean Julie.&#xD;
T haveroften seen her in your doorway&#xD;
as I have passed; but you shall intro-&#xD;
duce me to her. Show me at once to,&#xD;
your rooms, and she herself shall tell&#xD;
me what she wants."&#xD;
The turnkey,-after a little hesitation,&#xD;
complied with Hester's request, and in&#xD;
a few seconds they reached the hole&#xD;
in the wall. When they entered, Julie&#xD;
was sitting on a stool, her hands in her&#xD;
lap; she had evidently sent forth her&#xD;
father to speak to Hester, and was&#xD;
waiting an answer to her message. The&#xD;
girl now rose in confusion, and blushed&#xD;
deeply.&#xD;
" I did not mean this, father; I-did&#xD;
not wish the lady to trouble herself to&#xD;
come here."&#xD;
"But I proposed it," said Hester,&#xD;
"and it is no trouble. ,I wish I could&#xD;
do anything for Reuben, and you, too,&#xD;
for Reuben's kindness to Mr..Somerset.&#xD;
You have something, Julie, to ask of&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"You know my name, then" said-&#xD;
the turnkey's daughter, looking up&#xD;
more assured, and faintly smiling. "I&#xD;
am glad ,of that. I did not suppose&#xD;
you knew that a poor person.like my-&#xD;
self lived in the prison."&#xD;
" Then you see I take more notice&#xD;
than you imagine. But tell me in what&#xD;
I can please you."&#xD;
Julie looked at her father, and looked&#xD;
at the ground.. At length she spoke-&#xD;
"have thought, Miss Somerset,&#xD;
that T can be of some little service to&#xD;
you, if you will permit me. You are a&#xD;
lady, and, it-does nt seem right that&#xD;
yeou should do what I hear you do-&#xD;
darnMr. Somerset's clothes, mend his&#xD;
linen, and .sometimes attend to his&#xD;
rooms. Let these things be my task.&#xD;
I am :accustomed to work which you&#xD;
+annotbe."&#xD;
"And how am I to pay you, Julie?&#xD;
I would willingly be the means of af-&#xD;
fording you a"little pocket-money:; but&#xD;
all my endeavor is to save, not expend&#xD;
money."_&#xD;
Thegirl'aface became crimson, but&#xD;
the next instant her eyes filled with&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh! it is not for this. Do not&#xD;
think me so mean-so base. And yet,"&#xD;
she added with energy, "I am presump-&#xD;
tuous .enough to ask for something in&#xD;
return. Will you bestow upon me, say a&#xD;
half an hour a week? I never go out&#xD;
of the prison, and no one here will&#xD;
teach me. I am ignorant, and long to&#xD;
learn. Will you, then, give me a few&#xD;
lessons in reading and writing ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Reuben, seconding his&#xD;
daughter's suit, " this is all the girl&#xD;
has been thinking of for a long time&#xD;
past. I can't read or write myself,&#xD;
and am too poor to send her to school;&#xD;
so you see how the matter stands."&#xD;
" Reuben, say no more. I cannot&#xD;
allow Julie to mend my father's linen'&#xD;
or do other little things for him. The&#xD;
task is a pleasure, a source of happi-&#xD;
ness, which I cannot abandon to an-&#xD;
other."&#xD;
Julie, though she perfectly under-&#xD;
stood Hester's feelings, betrayed in her&#xD;
look deep disappointment, for she con-&#xD;
*sidered her prayer refused.&#xD;
"But this I will do" continued&#xD;
Hester, after a pause. "I am already&#xD;
under deep -obligations to Reuben;&#xD;
therefore, most willingly, three times&#xD;
a week, I will give you an hour's tui-&#xD;
tion, and will attend you here. Let us&#xD;
commence to-morrow."&#xD;
"Gad bless you I" said Reuben, his&#xD;
cheeks, eyes, and very forehead return-&#xD;
ing in smiles his honest thanks. "This&#xD;
is kind indeed. Julie now wilL have&#xD;
her heart's content; and be a learned&#xD;
lass after all."&#xD;
The girl 'did, not speak, but drew&#xD;
nearer, to Hester. Knowing nothing of&#xD;
the conventional ways of the world, she&#xD;
was influenced by a spontaneous feel-&#xD;
ingi ofnature-a feeling which might&#xD;
have prevailed in, the primitive ages of&#xD;
the world. She stooped, raised a part&#xD;
of Hester's dress, and fervently kissed&#xD;
it; thus expressing at once the grati-&#xD;
tude of her heart and the humility of&#xD;
her mind.      -&#xD;

engaged in his accustomed duties, we&#xD;
walking about the prison, and his wi&#xD;
was busy with her knitting in -a come&#xD;
Hester found Julie an apt schola&#xD;
and the progress which she made we&#xD;
rapid. In truth, the girl's intellec&#xD;
though it had never been develope&#xD;
was of a high order. The' diffiden&#xD;
andsquietude of her manner- were i&#xD;
beautiful contrast with the prompt&#xD;
tude andanimationwhich distinguishe&#xD;
that of Hester. But a very few word&#xD;
will suffice to point out the diserepanco&#xD;
physical and mental, prevailing b&#xD;
tween these two young women. Heste&#xD;
was tall and commanding, inheriting&#xD;
to a certain extent, the majestic depor&#xD;
ment of her inothpr. Julie was littl&#xD;
timid, and retiring, being formed rathe&#xD;
to lean on than to be the support of an&#xD;
other. Hester's features were -full o&#xD;
life ; her large eyes beamed with fir&#xD;
and -energy. The face of Julie had&#xD;
still, pensive expression, which- ar&#xD;
proached the sorrowful, and that fac&#xD;
was not cast, like Hester's, in a fauli&#xD;
less classic mould.- Their hair, how&#xD;
ever, was precisely of a similar color&#xD;
and the complexion of each was th&#xD;
true English blonde.&#xD;
The untaught mind of the turnkey'&#xD;
daughter was like a patch of ground&#xD;
f'or the first time receiving the beams o&#xD;
the genial sun afteradark and protract&#xD;
-ed winter. It imbibed with gratefu&#xD;
delight the new ideas-called up by th&#xD;
teaching of Hester.= The world of let&#xD;
tears was to her an essentially new&#xD;
world.  The notion of countless coun&#xD;
tries besides. her own,.natural truths,&#xD;
history - that dream  of the past&#xD;
-seemed to, her as gorgeous as they&#xD;
were novel, and her mind expanded,&#xD;
throwing off the chain with which it&#xD;
had so long been bound.&#xD;
One day, as Hester continued her in-&#xD;
structions, by an irresistible associa-&#xD;
tion of ideasher thoughts were carried&#xD;
back to the time when the peasant boy,&#xD;
Ernest Banks, thirsting, also, for know-&#xD;
ledge, came to her father, begging to&#xD;
be placed in the village school. In fan-&#xD;
cy, Hester- was again in the library at&#xD;
-Brookland Hall, listening to the boy's&#xD;
solicitatious.- ,.-She saw his cap iin his&#xD;
hand, his coarse jacket, and hobnailed=&#xD;
shoes; his manly front, great black&#xD;
eyes, and beat ifully chiselled features&#xD;
-all were before-her with the vivid-&#xD;
ness of reality. Her mind was so ab-&#xD;
~sorbed by the picture that she sat. ni-&#xD;

as face ; and yet tears, one by one, drop-&#xD;
t, ped from the long lashes of her down-&#xD;
d, cast eyes.&#xD;
ce   Julie was surprised and troubled at&#xD;
n -the singular absence of mind betrayed&#xD;
i- by her teacher. She would not; how-&#xD;
d ever, disturb herb reverie, but-sat oppo-&#xD;
Is site to her, silently looking into'her&#xD;

e- contemplation.- Like the nup, who-&#xD;
3r while gazing at-the pictured lineaments&#xD;
g, of the divine Cecilia, grew breathless&#xD;
t- with delight and adoration, so Julie ex-&#xD;
e, perienced a strange pleasure approach-&#xD;

1- garded Hester as a superior being, and'&#xD;
)f in her humility, believed herself born&#xD;
e only reverently to love and to serve her,&#xD;
a Hester at length recollected herself, and&#xD;
- observed her pupil sitting near her, the&#xD;
e book she had been studying having&#xD;
t- fallen on the floor.&#xD;
r-   "Go on, Julie; you have not yet fin-&#xD;

&#xD;
if there is another scene so fine as&#xD;

Hester smiled, at the simplicity of&#xD;
her pupil, and patted her on her cheek.&#xD;
"There are scenes nearly as fine, I1&#xD;
dare say,in, a few other places ; and I&#xD;
hope, one day,yeu will see them, Julie."&#xD;
Hester looked at the girl, earnestly&#xD;
for some time without speaking, and&#xD;
there was something unusual and pierc-&#xD;
ing in her scrutiny.     I,&#xD;
"Julie," she said at length, "it may&#xD;
be onlya fancy o°:mine, but your voice&#xD;
remind me forcibly of one who is very&#xD;
dear-to me."&#xD;
JThe interest of the turnkey's daugh-&#xD;
ter was excited.&#xD;
" Your words give me great pleasure.&#xD;
I am glad that I resemble in any slight&#xD;
thing those you love."&#xD;
"The dear person I mean is my mo-&#xD;
ther."&#xD;
Alas! poor lady !" said Julie; "my&#xD;
father his told me where she is."&#xD;
"Yes, she is still in the asylum," ob-&#xD;
served Hester, with a deep sigh. " But&#xD;
another word, Julie. More than one&#xD;
person here has told me that there is a&#xD;
likeness between yourself and me."&#xD;
The poor child of seclusion and low-&#xD;
ly birth, who was 'fully conscious that&#xD;
she was not handsome, while Hester&#xD;
appeared,,in her eyes, the type of all&#xD;
perfection, sprang up and laughed.-&#xD;
Unbelief°was; expressed in her laugh-&#xD;
ter, yet joy:too.. That she resembled&#xD;
the beautiful lady before her seemed a&#xD;
thing utterly impossible;. yet,:even for&#xD;
a distantand faint shadow of Hester's&#xD;
loveliness to be-reflected on her filled&#xD;
her -heart with pleasurable emotions.&#xD;
"Ilike you, -Miss Somerset ?-no, no.&#xD;
How could such a notionenter people's&#xD;

"I can:tell you, then, the primrose&#xD;

and kissed again her companion's dress,&#xD;
and even ventured to press:her hand to&#xD;
her lips. Hester looked at her thought.&#xD;
fully, and seemed to watch her emo-&#xD;
tions with deep interest.&#xD;
" Julie," she said, smich moved by&#xD;
the betrayal of her artless affection, "I&#xD;
feel an interest in you which I cannot&#xD;
account for. This distance must not&#xD;

"But he is a gentleman, and you&#xD;

"Speak not in this way. In spite of&#xD;

as good and as worthy as mine ?"&#xD;
"No, not so exalted--not so good."&#xD;
"Our spirits are attracted to each&#xD;

Hester drew the girl towards her in&#xD;
a fond, endearing manner; but the lat.&#xD;
ter, though trembling with delight,&#xD;
still considered the act too great a con,&#xD;
descension on the part of her compan-&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
&#xD;
HARTLEY VIsITS MRS. SOMERSET Ar BETH-&#xD;
LEHEM HOSPITAL.&#xD;
Ma, SOMERSET, .two or, three times,&#xD;
had purchased   a "liberty ticket."&#xD;
This term may be explained, by stating&#xD;
that for a :certain sum, usually four&#xD;
shillings, the warden of, the prison&#xD;
granted leave to prisoners to be absent&#xD;
for the space .of a day, good, security&#xD;
that they should return to their quar-&#xD;
ters having been previously given.&#xD;
Such a practice, as may be supposed,&#xD;
was a source of great emolument to the&#xD;
wardens, so that we find them making&#xD;
many hundreds 'a year by it. The&#xD;
system, as regard debtors' prisons, in&#xD;
the present day is entirely abolished.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset obtained his " liberty&#xD;
tickets" for the purpose of- accom-&#xD;
panying Hester to Bethlehem Hospital,&#xD;
for, however painful to.-him might be&#xD;
the sight sof his unhappy wife, he felt&#xD;
it his duty to see her, and to watch the&#xD;
progress of her distressing mental dis-&#xD;
ease. On no occasion had Isabella yet&#xD;
recognized her husband. It is fre-&#xD;
quently the case with the insane, that-&#xD;
the 'whom they once loved -the most&#xD;
dev  dly, they regard with total apa-&#xD;
thy or dislike. The' fixed eye, or the&#xD;
meaningless stare, the waving of the&#xD;
hand at some=imaginary object, still&#xD;
marked her..demeanor; and she con-&#xD;
tinued, in every respect, much in the&#xD;
same, state as when we described her&#xD;
in a previous portion of oar history.&#xD;
But we do not intend now to accom-&#xD;
pany the husband on one of his visits:&#xD;
we must direct our attention to another&#xD;
person-.&#xD;
A man with a moody and contem-&#xD;
plative aspect presented himself one&#xD;
morning atthe iron gates of the asy-&#xD;
lum.. He had obtained the usual order&#xD;
of admission from one of the governors,_&#xD;
for he represented thata relative was&#xD;
&#xD;
OMERSET.&#xD;
'confined within the walls. Crossing&#xD;
the gravelled. walk, he slowly mounted&#xD;
the steps of'the beautiful Ionic portico.&#xD;
He did not raise his eyes to admire the&#xD;
grace and majesty of that entrance,&#xD;
but, within the hall, he stood several&#xD;
minutes before Cibber's statues of&#xD;
Raving and Melancholy Madness. , An&#xD;
expression of strange pleasure flitted&#xD;
across his saturAine countenance, as&#xD;
though he experienced a morbid grati-&#xD;
fication in gazing on that embodiment&#xD;
of human frailty breathing in the&#xD;
marble.&#xD;
This was the first time Hartley had&#xD;
visited Bethlehem Hospital. He had&#xD;
long resisted the desire of going thither;&#xD;
but the wish of seeing the woman he&#xD;
had loved, and still loved even in her&#xD;
melancholy condition, grew so strong&#xD;
upon him, that he could .combat with&#xD;
his inclination no longer."&#xD;
The spirit of Hartley was never so&#xD;
scornful and, gloomy as when he wit-&#xD;
nessed' happiness in his fellow-crea-&#xD;
-tures. It seemed to him that the joy&#xD;
manifested by them was either hypo-&#xD;
crisy or an infallible s ign of mental&#xD;
weakness. He looked upon all men as&#xD;
moths whirling around the glare of a&#xD;
lamp-as being sporting about the edge&#xD;
of a grave. Such a mind, as a natural&#xD;
consequence, was coldly indifferent to&#xD;
the spectacle of suffering and misery.&#xD;
Sorrow, discontent, and gloom accord-&#xD;
ed with the nature.of his own internal&#xD;
world. Man, he considered, was not&#xD;
born to laugh, but _to think and mourn.&#xD;
To the eye of that despondent muser&#xD;
the heavens wore a pall of blackness ;&#xD;
the sunbeams, the flowers, and the&#xD;
gushing streams, were not types of,&#xD;
beauty, the reflected snile of the Be-&#xD;
neficent One ; they possessed no spell&#xD;
to soften his sdul or charm his sense.&#xD;
In a word Hattley's philosophy was&#xD;
steeped in darkness, and the very at-&#xD;
mosphere he breathed seemed charged&#xD;
with misery.&#xD;
And yet there were moments when&#xD;
he experienced a sort of pleasure, or&#xD;
he had not- otherwise belonged to the&#xD;
human family. That pleasure- sprang&#xD;
from the recollection of his passion for&#xD;
Isabella, and from the indulgence of it&#xD;
still in his waking dreams. Another&#xD;
and more debased source of gratification&#xD;
was the conviction that his envied and&#xD;
hated brother, like .Job of old, suf-&#xD;
fered now as much as he once enjoyed ;&#xD;
and that the revenge pursued through&#xD;

will not," thought Hartley, " recognize&#xD;
orrepulse me how."&#xD;
The thia fngers were clasped in his&#xD;
own, and Isabella did not move. He&#xD;
kissed that hand again and again. At&#xD;
length, roused by the action of Hartley,&#xD;
she turned in her chair.;&#xD;
"Who is this'? I do not know you.&#xD;
Are you the surgeon ? I am not ill.&#xD;
Leave te room, sir."&#xD;
"It is not thesurgeon, dear madam,"&#xD;

The poor lady, usually so tranquil,&#xD;
was now in 4 fit of frantic violence,&#xD;
such as the nurse -never beheld her&#xD;

stamped, waved her hands in agony&#xD;

soothe her to no purpose; and not until&#xD;
Hartley had quitted the room did that&#xD;

the object of her indignation being re-&#xD;
ruoved, sorrow and lamentation sue-&#xD;

took her place in her chair. Gradually&#xD;
her features resurned their wonted com-&#xD;

fixed on vacancy.&#xD;

had just witpessed much matter for&#xD;
profound thought. When he reached&#xD;
his, chambers in the Temple, he threw&#xD;
himself into a seat, and remained for a&#xD;
long time wrapped in deep meditation.&#xD;
To dissipate the gloomy images which&#xD;
so thickly crowded upon him, he had&#xD;
recourse to his favorite philosophers;&#xD;
but not long had his book been open&#xD;
before him, when he heard steps on the&#xD;
stairs, They appeared to be those of a&#xD;
person who mounted with difficulty,&#xD;
for the ascent was slow, and often in-&#xD;
terrupted, while a short distressing&#xD;
coughs was frequently heard.&#xD;
"This way, ma'.am, if you please ;&#xD;
here is the door,"'said some one with-&#xD;
out, whose sharp, voice was evidently&#xD;
that of a child. The next instant a low&#xD;
tapping was heard.&#xD;
" Come in," said Hartley, carelessly.&#xD;
The doer opened,-and a woman,&#xD;
stricken with blindness, being led by a&#xD;
little girl, advanced into the room. It&#xD;
was Mrs. Flemming.&#xD;
"Mr. Hartley lives here ?" she said,&#xD;
in a. low tremulous tone.&#xD;
"My name ,is Hartley," answered&#xD;
the Terplar, marvelling much what&#xD;
business the. woman could have with,&#xD;
him, for he had not the .slightest re-&#xD;
collection of her person.&#xD;
~9" That will do,my dear," said Mrs.&#xD;
Flenming to her little guide; "leave&#xD;
the room, and shut the door after you;&#xD;
when I want you again, I will call."&#xD;
The blind woian stood still, her&#xD;
hands crossed on her, breast, and her,&#xD;
face turned towards the spot where she&#xD;
believed Hartley- sat. There. was a&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER S&#xD;
firmness, a quiet dignity in her look,&#xD;
which the countenance of Mrs. Flem-&#xD;
ming never expressed before,. She&#xD;
uttered no word, still standing there,&#xD;
like one whom some sudden spell had&#xD;
turned to stone. The surprise of Hart-&#xD;
ley increased.&#xD;
"Oh ! that I .could see thee I" she&#xD;
said, at length ; " worlds would I give&#xD;
only to see thee for a moment !"&#xD;
"Who are you, woman? I know you&#xD;
not."&#xD;
" Roland Hartley ! have time, and&#xD;
sorrow, then, worked sqch change upon&#xD;
me, that even each mark of humanity,&#xD;
all likeness of what I was, is oblite-&#xD;
rated?"&#xD;
Hartley gazed searchingly on her.&#xD;
"Woe has wrinkled my forehead,&#xD;
and turned my hair gray before the&#xD;
natural course of time-the tears of&#xD;
long, long years have made me blind,&#xD;
and now they have ceased to flow-I&#xD;
am&#xD;
"Impossible !" cried Hartley, rising&#xD;
suddenly from  his chair;- "I do not&#xD;
see-"-."&#xD;
"Yes, you see her-her you wronged,&#xD;
ruined, deserted in her youth-her&#xD;
who, too proud to accept alms from&#xD;
him who refused to fulfil his vows, fled&#xD;
with her child. I am Flora Arundel !"&#xD;
"Flora Arundel ?" repeated Hartley.&#xD;
- "I hid my shame from the knowledge&#xD;
of all, and, under another name, toiled&#xD;
for my own living and the .support of&#xD;
my child. I knew where to find you,&#xD;
but never revealed myself,,never sought&#xD;
you; and I would have died unknown,&#xD;
but--"&#xD;
The callous-hearted man for a moment&#xD;
appeared moved. The flame in the&#xD;
lamp of Nature and feeling, though&#xD;
nearly out, rose for an instant. He&#xD;
took his victim by the hand :-&#xD;
" You did wrong, Flora; I would&#xD;
have rendered you .assistance; you&#xD;
shall have money now."&#xD;
" No, no; your gold I despise; I&#xD;
have not struggled with poverty for&#xD;
twenty years to receive alms at last.&#xD;
One, motive only brings me here. I&#xD;
am wrapped up in my child, my loved,&#xD;
my talented son ; they called him a&#xD;
hunchback, but to me he was all beauty&#xD;
and perfection. I have lost him now&#xD;
-he has left me forever."&#xD;
She bent her head, and mechanically&#xD;
raised her hands to cover her eyes.&#xD;
- .~"Be composed Flora," said Hartley,.&#xD;
" He is your child, Roland."&#xD;
&#xD;
0ME-RS-E T.&#xD;
&#xD;
145&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mine !" be repeated, sullenly--&#xD;
" yes, yes, let that pass."&#xD;
"The, hunchback is your child,"&#xD;
said the mother, in a louder tone.&#xD;
"Well, I admit it."&#xD;
" To whom, then, should" I come in&#xD;
my bereavement, my distress, but unto&#xD;
the .father ?-I-Roland ! Roland ! pity&#xD;
me-assist me 1"&#xD;
The scene was becoming, annoying&#xD;
to Hartley, for he hated to have his&#xD;
sympathies appedied to, or his peace&#xD;
disturbed. The first natural surprise,&#xD;
and the first touch of feeling being&#xD;
past, his hardness aind apathy returned.&#xD;
"Now we will not multiply words,&#xD;
Flora. Tell me at once-what you want."&#xD;
"Oh ! Father in heaven 1" cried the&#xD;
blind woman ; "Thou who hast afflicted&#xD;
thy poor sinful servant with the heavy&#xD;
course of bodily darkness, hear him who&#xD;
should have been- my protector, my&#xD;
husband, ask-what do I want ?"&#xD;
" This is mere raving, woman. Talk&#xD;
reasonably. The lad, you say, is a&#xD;
hunchback; what name have you given&#xD;
him ?"&#xD;
" The name ,I had assumed-Flem-&#xD;
ming, Mark Flemming."&#xD;
The Templar started; paleness over-&#xD;
spread his cheek, but he speedily re-&#xD;
covered himself.&#xD;
"Strange-singular   coincidence,"&#xD;
he muttered. " Flora, this is the young&#xD;
man who formed a-a design to carry&#xD;
off Miss Somerset."&#xD;
" Yes, lbut he repented, of his evil&#xD;
conduct. Roland, you and some other&#xD;
person were his abettors in that un-&#xD;
happy affair ; I am  confident of it.&#xD;
But now that you know Mark Flem-&#xD;
ming is your own son, save him-find&#xD;
him-restore him to me-1"&#xD;
A smile passedover the frigidfeaturbe&#xD;
of Hartley. The interestatfirst excited&#xD;
in his breast had entirely ceased.&#xD;
"Hear me ! this is why I seek you&#xD;
Mark knows you to ,be,.his' father., I&#xD;
discovered to him the secret before he -&#xD;
left me, and the intelligence seemed to&#xD;
overwhelm him. Roland, assist me in&#xD;
ascertaining where he has led. YJa&#xD;
have sight, you have strength and&#xD;
energy-oh!ChowI need them all nowI"&#xD;
" Advertise in the papers," said&#xD;
Hartley, turning away, and walking to&#xD;
the window.&#xD;
" That will be useless.. If he should&#xD;
see the advertisement, he will-not heed&#xD;
it. I must find him-I will draw him&#xD;
home by force-I must, I will have my&#xD;

son," sihe continued, raising her voi fe.&#xD;
" Is he not all to me ?-more than&#xD;
riches, and even good fame in this&#xD;
world? Oh ! villany, cruelty shall not&#xD;
deprive me of my child. Haste, then:&#xD;
let us fly to him before madness be his&#xD;
portion, or death overtake him. Igrow&#xD;
frantic without: him; every moment&#xD;
lost seems an age of agony, and wrings&#xD;
a drop of blood from my heart. Roland !&#xD;
come-Roland Hartley! I say, let us&#xD;
search for our child '"&#xD;
" Flora, this is folly. To tell you&#xD;
the truth, I cannot mix myself up with&#xD;
this affair. If the $d has left you, and&#xD;
refuses to return, I cannot help it ; and&#xD;
aif you are resolved on finding him, you&#xD;
must seek him yourself, for I shall take'&#xD;
no steps in the matter. Understand-&#xD;
this distinctly. Now, you had better&#xD;
leave my office."&#xD;
The'calm cold words of Hartley were&#xD;
as -swords piercing the heart of the&#xD;
bereaved mother. Oh! the bitter pang&#xD;
that wrings the soul when, in our&#xD;
wretchedness,,we seek for support and&#xD;
sympathy, and find none ! The heart&#xD;
recoils upon itself, and our loneliness&#xD;
is doubly lonely. The- blind woman&#xD;
hung upon the arm of him who had&#xD;
betrayed her in younger, years. She&#xD;
called upon him mildly, pathetically,&#xD;
to hear her, by her sorrows, by her&#xD;
blindness, caused through weeping for&#xD;
him; but he remained deaf to her&#xD;
entreaties. Her prayers were breathed&#xD;
more passionately, and her gestures&#xD;
became more ,vehement; then, as the&#xD;
mother's impatience and agony mo-&#xD;
mently increased, Hartley, wearied by&#xD;
her appeals, thrust her rudely and&#xD;
forcibly from him.&#xD;
The pride of the woman for an in-&#xD;
stant returned ; she stood at a short&#xD;
distance, and drew herself up. Raising&#xD;
her hand, she spoke in a deep and&#xD;
measured accent:_&#xD;
"Roland Hartley, I loved you once,&#xD;
and believed your affection for me was&#xD;
not feigned, was not all a lie. You&#xD;
have destroyed my happiness in this&#xD;
world and that whichis to come. I&#xD;
ask you now only a small favor--to&#xD;
search for our child-and Iam refused.&#xD;
What have I then left but to pour my&#xD;
malediction on- the false lover and&#xD;
unnatural father?  Take then   the&#xD;
curse of the wronged and the broken-&#xD;
hearted woman ; and may it cling to&#xD;
thy soul like a canker and a leprosy ;&#xD;
may it ring in thineears like the knell&#xD;
&#xD;
of dead Happiness by night and day.&#xD;
Roland Hartley, man of iron and&#xD;
cruelty-"'.&#xD;
- She lifted her sightless orbs to&#xD;
heaven, and seemed "preparing to&#xD;
speak, but words would not flow.&#xD;
Some revulsion of feeling suddenly&#xD;
took place within   her bosom-the&#xD;
rigidity of her features relaxed, and a&#xD;
softness stole over her thin cadaverous&#xD;
face. Recollections of past years, and&#xD;
sympathies long dormant, woke to life;&#xD;
her old and ill-starred love, the cause&#xD;
of her ruin and all her woe, came back,&#xD;
like a revived dream, upon her soul,&#xD;
and Flora Arundel could not curse the&#xD;
worshipped one of her youth, the father&#xD;
of her child.&#xD;
Her head drooped, her arms fell by&#xD;
her sides, ands the ifext minute, Sub-&#xD;
dued and comparatively calm, she knelt&#xD;
on the floor.&#xD;
"Oh, GodI whose laws I have&#xD;
broken, pardon me, and forgive this&#xD;
man! Thy unhappy servant will curse&#xD;
no one ; let.'me bear my heavy load-&#xD;
the burden of my misery-alone !"&#xD;
Mrs. Flemming, arose from     her&#xD;
knees, and, turning from Hartley, in-&#xD;
stinctively passed towards the door.&#xD;
She called the child who stood outside&#xD;
on the stairs, and then the blind wo-&#xD;
man,- with her little guide, silently&#xD;
pursued her way from the precincts of&#xD;
the Temple.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE DEATH-STRUGGLE IT HYDE PAR.&#xD;
"I HAVE you again-I clasp you&#xD;
again-I call, you mine again-my&#xD;
loved one, my joy, my more than life !&#xD;
I reek not blindness now, for you are&#xD;
the sun of my soul; I defy sorrow and&#xD;
pain now, for you will comfort me !"&#xD;
Thus spoke the mother, as she strain-&#xD;
ed her son in her arms. Flemming&#xD;
had returned after the absence of a&#xD;
fortnight : and why had he deserted&#xD;
his parent? 'For the first time she had&#xD;
informed him he was base-born, for&#xD;
hitherto Flemming had imagined his&#xD;
father died when he was an infant.&#xD;
Remarkably sensitive and keenly alive&#xD;
to all that the world considers dishonor,&#xD;
his mother's position, and the blot on&#xD;
her name, affected him powerfully.&#xD;
His first feelings towards her were in-&#xD;
dignation and shame, amounting al-&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
most to abhorrence; and, in this frame&#xD;
of mind, he fled from the unfortunate&#xD;
woman, resolving never to behold her&#xD;
again. But Nature's pleadings were&#xD;
soon heard; the thought of her unpro-&#xD;
tected situation, her wrongs, and her&#xD;
sorrows, melted downthe iron of pride,&#xD;
while filial love urged him back to her&#xD;
whom his heart clung to, in spite of the&#xD;
past, with a strength of affection ex-&#xD;
ceeded only by her own.&#xD;
" Then you forgive me ?" said Flem-&#xD;
ming. " The feelings I entertained I&#xD;
acknowledge to be unjust and wrong.&#xD;
You are to be pitied, my dear mother,&#xD;
not condemned."&#xD;
"I have no -forgiveness to grant, my&#xD;
son; I feel only gratitude to Heaven.&#xD;
I have nothing but love to pour upon&#xD;
you."-&#xD;
"But on one," pursued Flemming&#xD;
-" on one man must justice, the bolt&#xD;
of vengeance, fall.. Too long, too long,&#xD;
have your wrongs been unredressed."&#xD;
The mother could not behold the&#xD;
working features and the clenched&#xD;
hand of him who spoke: and. well it&#xD;
was so. Had she known all which&#xD;
burned in that bosom-the - hatred&#xD;
cherished for Hartley, the determina-&#xD;
tion to obtain revenge, her nature had&#xD;
shrunk, and all her recent, anxiety for&#xD;
the fate of her child would have been&#xD;
renewed.&#xD;
Days passed. Flemming had called&#xD;
several timesson Hartley in the Temple,&#xD;
since his mother's visit; but after two&#xD;
or three interviews, Hartley, annoyed&#xD;
and wearied, would see him no more.&#xD;
The hunchback, persevering in his&#xD;
calls, the Templar employed one of the&#xD;
porters to-prevent the youth's entrance&#xD;
at the door; and finally the police took&#xD;
himinto custody, and he was cautioned,&#xD;
never again to repeat his ofence on&#xD;
pain of imprisonment.&#xD;
Flemming was doggedly obstinate.&#xD;
He.would not bend from his purpose,&#xD;
or relinquish the idea of .obtaining&#xD;
justice for his mother. Since he could&#xD;
not gain access to his father's cham-&#xD;
bers, he would watch him in his walks.&#xD;
Hartley's solitary habits frequently&#xD;
led him to the suburbs of London, and&#xD;
one of his favorite rambles was in&#xD;
Hyde Park. It was about ten o'clock&#xD;
in the evening, when, returning from&#xD;
Kensington-gardens, he crossed the&#xD;
park in the direction of the Piccadilly&#xD;
entrance. The moon, in   her first&#xD;
quarter, hung over the clumps of trees,&#xD;
&#xD;
147&#xD;
&#xD;
the tops of which were faintly silvered,&#xD;
while all below was black massy shade.&#xD;
It was profoundly still, but the air was&#xD;
cold, the latter circumstance having&#xD;
caused loiterers and pedestrians to re-&#xD;
turnto theirhomes. Hartley passednear'&#xD;
the Serpentine River, the crisp wave-&#xD;
lets of which glittered at intervals as&#xD;
the moon's rays fell obliquely on them.&#xD;
The stream thus doubly answered to&#xD;
its name, for' it wound its sinuous&#xD;
course, and shone also, like a serpent&#xD;
trailing his scaly length through the&#xD;
green grass.&#xD;
At a short distance on his- right,&#xD;
Hartley perceived a dark spot close by&#xD;
the water. It moved, and he imagined&#xD;
it to be a dog.. As the path, however,&#xD;
conducted him nearer, he discovered&#xD;
the figure to be that of a human being.&#xD;
The man was sitting on the ground,&#xD;
coiled up in the ,form of a ball; but&#xD;
now, as it were, he unrolled himself&#xD;
and sprang upon his feet. In the short&#xD;
deformed body, and long legs,,Hartley&#xD;
at once recognized Mark Flemming.&#xD;
The hunchback placed himself "i.&#xD;
front of the solitary walker; -his eyes&#xD;
glared beneath the black mass of his&#xD;
uncombed hair, and his white - face&#xD;
shone yet more white in the faint and&#xD;
sickly rays of the moon. Hartley, at&#xD;
the unexpected appearance'of hin who&#xD;
had recently watched his movements&#xD;
and harassedhim in no small degree,&#xD;
drew involuntarily backward. Flem-&#xD;
ming did not move, and the other, re-&#xD;
covering from his surprise, was about&#xD;
to proceed without speaking.&#xD;
"No," said Flemming, "y6u will not&#xD;
escape me. --I have not followed you&#xD;
from your chambers, and waited here&#xD;
two hours, for nothing. Mr. Hartley,&#xD;
my father, we must now come to an un-&#xD;
derstanding with each other."&#xD;
"Boy, my answer is the answer I&#xD;
have returned before.'- ' I will. have&#xD;
nothing to do with you. Being of age,&#xD;
you possess no claim on me. Gain a&#xD;
livelihood in the world in any way you&#xD;
choose, and torment me no mere."&#xD;
"Not for myself do-I plead: the son&#xD;
has no personal favor to ask of his&#xD;
father ; Ionly demand again, and-if it&#xD;
be not granted, I'must continue to de-&#xD;
mand it while I have breath-justice&#xD;
for my mother !"&#xD;
"Folly! you know not what you ask ;&#xD;
I-cannot listen to you-out of my way:!"&#xD;
"Not yet: by Him who framed thee&#xD;
and me, and beholds -us now, thou&#xD;

&#xD;
shalt hear me ! Look at me, my father!&#xD;
Have I not sufficient to bear in this&#xD;
blighted misshapen body?  Am I not&#xD;
the scorn and ridicule of my fellows ?&#xD;
My calamity weighs down my soul,&#xD;
and bids me think death would be a&#xD;
blessing. Now, in addition, I have&#xD;
the knowledge qf my being base-born&#xD;
-a thing thrust out from the pale of&#xD;
law and society. I cannot lift my head&#xD;
for shame-I am stricken to the dust-&#xD;
the ineradicable spot clinging to my&#xD;
name forever. Who has done this ?-&#xD;
thou: what has caused my deep degra-&#xD;
dation -thy falsehood to my mother :&#xD;
art thou not, then, instead of a father,&#xD;
my blackest foe ?- Yet I forgive thee&#xD;
on one condition--be just and honora-&#xD;
ble at last; it is not even now too late :&#xD;
fulfil thy early vows-restore to thy&#xD;
victim an honest name before she dies&#xD;
--be true to thy promise, though it be&#xD;
at the eleventh hour."&#xD;
"JDreamer and fool !". interrupted'&#xD;
Hartley, " I understand not your sense-&#xD;
less babble-I can'remain listening to'&#xD;
you no longer.",&#xD;
"Father l" cried Flemming, seizing&#xD;
him by the arm, "justice to my mother&#xD;
-keep your oaths-wipe from her name&#xD;
the foul stain--wed her, and then per-&#xD;
mit her to die in peace."&#xD;
Haftley laughed aloud.&#xD;
Bitter mocker! cruel betrayer!&#xD;
her misery and her blindness have a&#xD;
double claim upon you."-&#xD;
"Your utter ignorance,:boy, makes&#xD;
me laugh. Know you so little of the&#xD;
world as to believe it possible for me to&#xD;
marry your. mother? She does not,&#xD;
and never did belong to the class of so-&#xD;
ciety entitling her to become my wife."&#xD;
"Then why did you tender-her vows&#xD;
of honorable attachment ?"&#xD;
"Pshaw! that is the young man's&#xD;
common practice. He vows, prays,&#xD;
and promises, of course, but it is un-&#xD;
derstood that his words mean nothing.&#xD;
He forgets them afterwards. 'Tis the&#xD;
way of the:world-'tis human nature."&#xD;
Flemming was goaded to frenzy by&#xD;
these light bantering words. " I have&#xD;
been guilty," he cried; "my deeds&#xD;
have been black enough, yet I had no&#xD;
intention to- embitter by dishonor the&#xD;
life of her I rashlyloved. Heaven be&#xD;
praised ! she -is taintless, restored to&#xD;
her father again, And free forever from&#xD;
my polluting touch. But your cruelty&#xD;
and falsehood were pursued on system;&#xD;
your villany has never been repented&#xD;
&#xD;
of; and now, even when an opportunity&#xD;
offers to repair the past, you refuse to&#xD;
do it.".&#xD;
"Yes, I refuse,; and, in addition&#xD;
to this," continued Hartley, "know,&#xD;
wretched and insolent boyI that I&#xD;
never loved your motherr"&#xD;
"Never loved her ! after all that&#xD;
passed? Oh ! villany on villany !"&#xD;
" Ay, and as much as I loathe you,&#xD;
vile piece of deformity! I now detest&#xD;
her. Away ! I east you both from me ;&#xD;
I- renounce all connection with you;&#xD;
and here I command you never to cross&#xD;
my path again !"&#xD;
" Cross your path ?" cried Flemming,&#xD;
fiercely detaining Hartley as the latter&#xD;
was about to proceed-"I will never&#xD;
cease to do it. .I scorn your commands;&#xD;
I laugh at your threats. I will pursue&#xD;
you through life. Thou shalt be an&#xD;
Orestes followed by the Furies, for-thou&#xD;
art worse than he. Where thou art,&#xD;
there shalt thou behold me' - thy&#xD;
haunter, thy demon. And never will&#xD;
my efforts cease., Can my task be com-&#xD;
pleted .until I gain redress and ven-&#xD;
geance for my mother's wrongs ?"&#xD;
As these words were spoken vehe-&#xD;
mently, the countenance of Hartley&#xD;
underwent a fearful change. Difficult&#xD;
to be moved from his wonted cold col-&#xD;
lectedness and stoical hardness, when&#xD;
his passions were aroused, he lost all&#xD;
command of himself; his rage com-&#xD;
pletely metamorphosed his nature. It&#xD;
was not with him an honest storm,&#xD;
which blusters and blows itself to rest;&#xD;
it was the fearful tornado which suc-&#xD;
ceeds the calm, and brings with it the&#xD;
lightnings which shiver and consume.&#xD;
Hartley fixed his eyes on the youth&#xD;
with fiery malignity ; his overhanging&#xD;
brow was contracted into thick lines ;&#xD;
his thin lips, drawn back, showed dis-&#xD;
tinctly his white .dazzling teeth; and&#xD;
his throat swelled like the throat of the,&#xD;
constrictor when about to spring on its&#xD;
prey.&#xD;
"Thou will cross me, thou sayest; .&#xD;
thou wilt not cease to-follow and tor-&#xD;
ment me. And is my peace to be,&#xD;
broken by a thing like thee ?"  -&#xD;
"Yes, a thing like me!--a misera-&#xD;
ble, creeping reptile, like me, who am,&#xD;
nevertheless; thy son."&#xD;
"What matters ?" said Hartley, as&#xD;
though speaking to himself;. "if a,&#xD;
part of me, I have a greater right to&#xD;
cast it from me, and to quench its ener-&#xD;
gies when it embittersjiy own exist-&#xD;
&#xD;
H E S TER S O ME IRS E T.&#xD;
&#xD;
ence. Whether it sleep now or thirty&#xD;
years hence, it can make little differ-&#xD;
ence."&#xD;
As he ground these words through&#xD;
his teeth, rather than spoke, Hartley&#xD;
continued, to drag Flemming nearer to&#xD;
the Serpentine. The latter, half com-&#xD;
prehending the meaning of the action,&#xD;
struggled in his grasp. The hunch-&#xD;
back was vigorous, but in the iron&#xD;
gripe of the athletic Hartley he seemed&#xD;
a mere child.&#xD;
"Would you murder me ?" cried&#xD;
Flemming--" would you-kill your son?"&#xD;
"Send thee to slumber, unhappy be-&#xD;
ing, only a little while before thy natu-&#xD;
ral time."&#xD;
The bank sloped away to the edge of&#xD;
the water, which in that place was of'&#xD;
an unusual depth. The air was still;&#xD;
the moon had sunk behind the trees,&#xD;
and there was no human being, besides&#xD;
these two, in that part of the park. All&#xD;
favored the unnatural father's design.&#xD;
Down towards the water they still went&#xD;
reeling. With a violent effort, Hartley&#xD;
bound Flemming's arms together, and,&#xD;
thus manacled, he would be unable to&#xD;
swim. The margin -of the bank crum-&#xD;
bled beneath their feet-would the&#xD;
murderer relent?&#xD;
Night ! draw thy veil over the -scene.&#xD;
Humanity 1 hide from Virtue's eye the&#xD;
spectacle of cruelty and horror. When&#xD;
will the spirit of Cain cease to walk&#xD;
the earth, andithe demons be chained&#xD;
in their adamantine caves, to stir up no&#xD;
more to madness the hearts of men?&#xD;
" My mother ! my mother 1" were the&#xD;
last words that gurgled over-the water;'&#xD;
then:quietness fell around. The stars&#xD;
shone placidly on high, the little waves,&#xD;
crept "on with faintest murmurs, and&#xD;
the flowers on the bank drank the night-&#xD;
dews with their odorous lips. Nature&#xD;
changed not in her aspect of peace and&#xD;
beauty,, but all things .continued to&#xD;
smile, as if no soul that instant had&#xD;
been disunited from its fleshy bonds,&#xD;
and sent from life and light into the&#xD;
dark unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER .X.-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PAUPER FUNERAL-THE PRoSPECTs&#xD;
-     oF RESTER BRIGHTEN.'&#xD;
TrE truth was not discovered. A&#xD;
person was found drowned in the Ser-&#xD;
&#xD;
149&#xD;
&#xD;
pentine--an event of very frequent oc-&#xD;
currence in connection with that sub-&#xD;
urban river. All marks of violence&#xD;
being absent, and the man's arms&#xD;
having been bound with a handkerchief&#xD;
bearing - initials  which  afterwards&#xD;
proved to be those of his own name,&#xD;
the case was considered one of despe-&#xD;
rate self-destruction, and a verdict at&#xD;
the coroner's inquest was returned ac-&#xD;
cordingly.&#xD;
She who might have guessed the&#xD;
perpetrator of the deed was unable to&#xD;
give her testimony or state her convie-&#xD;
tions to the world. Therecognition of&#xD;
the lifeless Flemming, who lay at the&#xD;
workhouse to be claimed by his friends,&#xD;
proved a shock too great for the already&#xD;
enfeebled mother. There are cords of&#xD;
the heart which anguish can literally&#xD;
strain and break; there is a grief that&#xD;
can kill. The parent died on the body&#xD;
of her child.&#xD;
A pauper funeral-the two victims&#xD;
at least received this last acknowledg&#xD;
ment of humanity from their fellow-&#xD;
creatures. A few boards hastily nailed&#xD;
together ; a hurrying away of- the ide-&#xD;
ceased on the shoulders of men who;&#xD;
being allowed no " dram," do their work&#xD;
sulkily; no one to follow, no one to drop&#xD;
a tear over remains so mean and de-&#xD;
spised ; a thrusting of the coffins into&#xD;
shallow holes, rather than- pits, in one&#xD;
corner of the crowded parish grave-&#xD;
yard; no-stone, no raised turf to mark&#xD;
the spot, but a trampling and beating&#xD;
down to make-the place level with the&#xD;
surrounding soil, so that new-comers&#xD;
may be piled upon the last without sus-&#xD;
picion-such is a pauper's funeral!&#xD;
Well may we sigh to muse on thy lot,&#xD;
Flora  Arundel I -to think of thy&#xD;
youth's spring, thy beauty, thy loving&#xD;
heart, thy betrayal and. desertion, thy&#xD;
anxious character as a toiling mother&#xD;
thy poverty, thy bereavement, and-thy&#xD;
pauper's grave at last I Sad destinyif&#xD;
God's created! Ohbd Heaven, the eter-&#xD;
nal fount, of justice, if, another world&#xD;
did not await us, where the sufferers&#xD;
of earth shall be comforted and -receive&#xD;
their-good things, how might we recon-&#xD;
cile the acts of Providence with the&#xD;
laws of equity and the attributes of&#xD;
mercy ?&#xD;
Time passed, and the tragic occur-&#xD;
rence began to be less thought of by&#xD;
Mr. Somerset and his daughter, for&#xD;
these two alone it affected. The pros-&#xD;
pects of Hester daily brightened in her&#xD;

&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
school near Doctors' Commons, The&#xD;
young mistress was universally liked,I&#xD;
and her pupils became so numerous&#xD;
that the task of superintending them&#xD;
was one of close application and unre-&#xD;
witted exertion. Julie, the turnkey's&#xD;
daughter, never failed to assist her&#xD;
every day in the more laborious por-&#xD;
tions of her duties. Hester, however,&#xD;
wished her to relinquish these menial&#xD;
offices, but the girl, in her humility and,&#xD;
anxiety to be useful, would not abandon&#xD;
her accustomed tasks; yes, her pride&#xD;
and happiness seemed to consist in -be-&#xD;
ing considered Hester's servant ; her&#xD;
intense love and devotion were tem-&#xD;
pered by a meek spirit of distant re-&#xD;
spect,-and this mingled sentiment; while&#xD;
it urged her to embrace one towards&#xD;
whom her heart so yearned, imposed&#xD;
on her silence, and prompted reserve.&#xD;
The income which Hester derived&#xD;
from  her pupils, forty in  number,&#xD;
amounted to about 1201. a year. Of&#xD;
this she saved more than   one-half.&#xD;
Should she be able to maintain her&#xD;
present position, the happy calculator,&#xD;
the clever and thrifty financier,, con-&#xD;
sidered that in five years she should&#xD;
have accumulated   the sum  desired.&#xD;
Already had she labored six years, but&#xD;
the fruits of her toil, at. that moment,-&#xD;
amounted to no more than forty pounds.&#xD;
Brighter skies now spread above her,&#xD;
and richer harvests seemed to wave at&#xD;
her feet. " Five years"-how : often&#xD;
Hester whispered these words to her-&#xD;
self!-five short years, and the neces-&#xD;
sary sum would be in her hands ; then&#xD;
Hartley's schemes would be baffled, and&#xD;
his malignity defied, for her father&#xD;
would be free t "Five short years'-&#xD;
had any one at the still hour of night&#xD;
hung over her couch, her lips in.sleep&#xD;
might have been    heard  breathing&#xD;
these words. She dreamed of money,&#xD;
of bills of exchange, of saving pound&#xD;
after pound for one holy purpose. The&#xD;
once  reckless, frolicksome  girl of&#xD;
Brookland Hall-had beenconverted into&#xD;
a plodding merchant, an-,anxious accu-&#xD;
mulator of thst sordid dust-gold and&#xD;
silver. So her fingers, in her dreams,&#xD;
would move quickly,;as if .in the:actiof&#xD;
counting; then the words, "Lawyers,&#xD;
Insolvent Court, Debtors' Prisons,"&#xD;
would follow at intervals, being always&#xD;
succeeded by:the "five-short years-&#xD;
free-! free l"-while smiles would steal&#xD;
across her face, and tears of the heart's&#xD;
full ~rapture well. from beneath the&#xD;
&#xD;
snowy lids, which lay so tranquilly on&#xD;
her sleeping cheek.&#xD;
Thus the daughter of the poor debt-&#xD;
or in the Fleet continued to press on&#xD;
towards the goal of her desires. Beau-&#xD;
tiful dream of affection ! bright hopes&#xD;
of coming joy!1 and must they, too, be&#xD;
scattered and dissolved ?&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XI-&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. PIKE AND HIS NOTABLE PLAN. FOR&#xD;
BREAKING UP HESTER'S SCHOOL.&#xD;
MR. PIKE in his last project had suf-&#xD;
fered a defeat, and this was occasioned,&#xD;
thereader will remember, bythe repent-&#xD;
ance of Flemming, who, after the fear-&#xD;
ful scene through which Hester passed,&#xD;
had sent her back in safety to her&#xD;
lodgings. The circumstance caused&#xD;
the little attorney much chagrin and&#xD;
anger, for failure in anything he under-&#xD;
took was almost unknown to him, his&#xD;
sagacity and professional wisdom usu-&#xD;
ally triumphing over every difficulty.&#xD;
Thinking of his discomfiture, he stamp-&#xD;
ed to and fro in his office in St. Mary-&#xD;
Axe ; anon he stopped, apd beat the&#xD;
table savagely with his fist, uttering,&#xD;
at the same time, many threatening&#xD;
words..&#xD;
At length the indignant gentleman&#xD;
-consoled himself byborming plans for&#xD;
the future, and in dressing his frugal&#xD;
dinner.; the :last was prepared inthe&#xD;
inner room, and consisted solelyof cheap&#xD;
vegetables: thus engaged, the fund-&#xD;
holder sank into deep meditation ; and&#xD;
whether. his thoughts were of a plea-&#xD;
sant description, or the savory fumes&#xD;
of his favorite viands gratified his ol-&#xD;
factory sense, certain it was that-he&#xD;
smiled till his broad mouth puckered&#xD;
up at the corners, his three .solitary&#xD;
teeth obtruded- th selves, and his&#xD;
little round eyes twinkled like' black&#xD;
glass beads.'&#xD;
"Hai ha ! she thought I shouldn't&#xD;
find her out, did she ?" whispered the&#xD;
happy gentleman. "To be sure I have&#xD;
had considerable trouble in tracing her;&#xD;
and odd it was to stable upon her in&#xD;
that way, amidst all her scholars. What&#xD;
a nest of them, too, the young creature&#xD;
has contrived to gather around her!-..&#xD;
There's money coming in, no doubt of&#xD;
it ; but the thing must not go on-no,,.&#xD;
no."&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.-&#xD;
&#xD;
The face of Mr. Pike assumed a more&#xD;
serious and anxious expression. He did&#xD;
not,. however, soliloquize again until&#xD;
he had finished his repast, and drunk&#xD;
his usual tumbler of springwater: that&#xD;
beverage agreed with him far better,&#xD;
than ale or other strong drinks, the&#xD;
love of which, he maintained, in his&#xD;
rigid code of morals, ranked among the&#xD;
greatest of crimes.&#xD;
"I wonder," said Mr. Pike, "if Hart-&#xD;
ley did make away with that youth,&#xD;
after all. If I were sure of this, what&#xD;
a hold I should have upon him !-,-I&#xD;
would not drag him to justice-no, no,&#xD;
that would never answer my purpose ;&#xD;
moreover, I am averse to the system of&#xD;
hanging, for it cuts off a man from, the&#xD;
possibility ofrepentanee, and of amend-&#xD;
ing his life. I should act most wicked-&#xD;
ly if I brought Hartley to the gallows,;&#xD;
but -instead,. making good flow from&#xD;
evil, I would demand from him, for&#xD;
keeping silence, in lieu of my paltry&#xD;
annuity, say one thousand a year ; or he&#xD;
should pay me a large sum at once, as&#xD;
a provision for my old age.,. Thus&#xD;
Flemming's death would serve him and&#xD;
serve me, while= the youth himself,&#xD;
spared the troubles and temptations of&#xD;
this evil world, would be happy in an-&#xD;
other-at least, I hope so."&#xD;
With a placid and benevolent smile,&#xD;
Mr. Pike rose from his table, and began&#xD;
to brush up the faded nap of his large&#xD;
hat; he brushed, too, his threadbare&#xD;
coat, and his little black trousers, worn&#xD;
very white down the seams; he then&#xD;
passed his straps under his broad heavy&#xD;
shoes, which, to save the expense of&#xD;
blacking, were oiled,,so that they look-&#xD;
ed in dull but respectable mourning&#xD;
all through the year. These things&#xD;
Mr. Pike did preparatory to his going&#xD;
abroad, for he hated slovenliness, and'&#xD;
prided himself on being-not smart&#xD;
indeed inhis toilet-but always" neat."&#xD;
The attorney was gojpg to the print-&#xD;
er's office,,to urge en the completion of&#xD;
certain placards.. As usual, he assumed&#xD;
in :the business a feigned name ; and&#xD;
from this habitual precaution arose the&#xD;
difficulty of ever tracing an act to the&#xD;
agency of the politic lawyer.&#xD;
A few days after the little scene just&#xD;
described, a man might have been ob-&#xD;
-served walking slowly up and down in&#xD;
the vicinity of- Wardrobe-place; he&#xD;
wore .atop coat-for the weather was&#xD;
rather cold-and round his neck was&#xD;
wrapped alarge woollen comforter, into&#xD;
&#xD;
151&#xD;
&#xD;
which, his chin was plunged, little of&#xD;
his face beiug seen besides his eyes.&#xD;
He looked at his watch ; it was almost&#xD;
five o'clock; and as that apparently&#xD;
wished-for hour approached, he drew&#xD;
nearer to the entrance of Wardrobe-&#xD;
place.&#xD;
".They'll not be long now," said the&#xD;
little gentleman as he took a large&#xD;
packet of what appeared to be letters&#xD;
from his side-pocket, looked at them,&#xD;
and returned them once more to the&#xD;
deep repository.  "The school is al-&#xD;
ways over at five-that I- know; we&#xD;
will put a stop to this money-making,"&#xD;
he =added. " If I was defeated last&#xD;
time, I'll try not to be defeated this.&#xD;
Why, I learn she saves money fast-a&#xD;
very annoying circumstance to Mr.&#xD;
Hartley; but I'll please him-I'll do&#xD;
his business for him cleverly, and~ he&#xD;
shall not upbraid me again with a fail-&#xD;
ure. What do I meditate doing?-an&#xD;
evil action ?-certainly not. First, I&#xD;
serve my employer-and every man's&#xD;
duty is to be faithful to his employer.&#xD;
Secondly, Mr. Somerset must not be&#xD;
freed from prison ;,he is better there, I&#xD;
say again, and leads a more quiet and&#xD;
virtuous, life than' he would do if at&#xD;
liberty, surrounded by the.temptations&#xD;
of the world. Lastly, the close atmo-&#xD;
sphere of a room filled with children&#xD;
must be highly injurious to the health&#xD;
of this young woman.. Oh1 yes, Iam&#xD;
justified in my conduct, and I feel quite&#xD;
satisfied and happy in my conscience."&#xD;
Saying this, Mr. Pike, with a cheer-&#xD;
ful step, walked under the covered way&#xD;
which leads to Wardrobe-place. He&#xD;
took his station at the corner, opposite&#xD;
one of the old lime-trees;she looked up&#xD;
among the branches, and a red-breas&#xD;
was there singing merrily.; the little&#xD;
chorister was harmless, and free from&#xD;
all guile, just as Mr. Pike believed his&#xD;
own spirit to be.&#xD;
St. Paul's clock struck, five; the&#xD;
attorney gazed. anxiously at the house&#xD;
in which Hester held her school.-The&#xD;
dooropened, and the children, one by&#xD;
one, not noisily ori in confusion, issued&#xD;
forth. They walked toaartis the covered&#xD;
passage where our afriend;stood,_each&#xD;
proceeding- to -her , home. Then Mr.&#xD;
Pike might have been seen with his&#xD;
larrge packet.ofletters in his handjhia&#xD;
snipy face half; buried in the.great&#xD;
woollen comforter, and his hat drawn&#xD;
over his eyes. The orderly condut of&#xD;

gather, facilitated the performance of&#xD;
what he had in view. Quickly, as they&#xD;
severally passed, he -placed into the&#xD;
hands of each one of his letters: it was,&#xD;
carefully wafered, and addressed " To&#xD;
theiMother of this Young Lady." Some&#xD;
of the children stared; but letters ten-&#xD;
dered to them by such an amiable-look-&#xD;
ing old gentleman, and directed to their&#xD;
mothers, awakened their curiosity, and&#xD;
they willinglyreceived them.&#xD;
",Don't give them  to any one but&#xD;
your excellent mothers, my dear' chil-&#xD;
dren," said Mr. Pike, in his mildest&#xD;
and most winning tone of voice. " Go&#xD;
home-now, sweet innocents!1 and take&#xD;
an old man's blessing !"&#xD;
Reaching the main street, the chil-&#xD;
dren dispersed to their respective dwell-&#xD;
ings; and Mr. Pike also turned away&#xD;
from Wardrobe-place.&#xD;
"I think that will do," he said; " I&#xD;
have done it quietly-very comfortably.&#xD;
A happy thought it was, ant- far bet-&#xD;
ter than the plan I adopted on the for-&#xD;
nmer occasion, when I called on the&#xD;
parents. We shall see how the society's&#xD;
name in this way will work. Pike, you&#xD;
are an ingenious fellow-a clever dog-&#xD;
yes, yes, but a conscientious man too.'7&#xD;
So the attorney went home pleasantly&#xD;
chuckling, and feeling all the while&#xD;
"satisfied and happy" in his own con-&#xD;
science.&#xD;
Now, what might be .the contents of&#xD;
the letters' or circulars which Mr. Pike&#xD;
had so carefully distributed among&#xD;
Hester's pupils? Each,- as we' said,&#xD;
was addressed "To' the Mother of this&#xD;
Young:Lady," and it ran as follows :-&#xD;
"REsPEOTED MADAM-Perhaps you&#xD;
are aware that, i our great metropolis,&#xD;
two excellent societies exist, whose-ob-&#xD;
jects are to protect private families from&#xD;
thedesignsof thieves,-and to watch over&#xD;
the morals of the people-their names&#xD;
being 'The Fraud-Preventiig Society,'&#xD;
and the,'Society for'the Abolition of&#xD;

dressed by the last-named association.&#xD;
Oar officers' and visitors; in'their&#xD;

a certain schoolhas been set up,'pur-&#xD;
portingo-to bekept by a young [,ady ;f&#xD;

&#xD;
duty must be performed. One.motive&#xD;
only influences 'us in our exertions-a&#xD;
desire that the rising generation should&#xD;
be honest, virtuous, and worthy of the&#xD;
parents who bore them. How import-&#xD;
ant is it, then, that children, and espe-&#xD;
cially young females, ,should be placed&#xD;
under the tuition of those only whose&#xD;
principles are correct,;. The school&#xD;
alluded to has been started by a young&#xD;
woman who appears to be a lady, and&#xD;
possessed of amiable manners.: alas !&#xD;
so ihuch greater the danger !-Our of-&#xD;
ficers have discovered that she is not&#xD;
'what she should be;' in a word, that&#xD;
she is an impostor. The unhappy crea-&#xD;
ture has borne two or three different&#xD;
names, to hide her previous actions, and&#xD;
aid her designs in getting money. She&#xD;
is well known at the police courts, and&#xD;
has been in custody several times for&#xD;
divers offences-and among them, theft.&#xD;
At this very moment, her father is a&#xD;
prisoner in a common jail!&#xD;
- " Under these circumstances, respect-&#xD;
ed Madam, we feel it our duty to give&#xD;
you a friendly warning. If you desire&#xD;
the well-being of your child, take her&#xD;
away from that school. Our letter will&#xD;
be tendered to your daughter by one of&#xD;
our visitors ; this mode of. communica&#xD;
tion, for certain reasons, appearing to&#xD;
us most expedient.&#xD;
(Signed)&#xD;
The Society for the Abolition of Vice,&#xD;
"cJOHN  Jons, Secretary."&#xD;
In addition to the above alarming&#xD;
epistle, the indefatigable Mr. Pike had&#xD;
caused; in the dusk of the same even-&#xD;
ing,= several printed .-placards to be&#xD;
posted on the walls near Wardrobe-&#xD;
place. The men-who with their cans&#xD;
of paste and long poles make their&#xD;
employment a regular profession-per-&#xD;
formed their duty well; for, in the&#xD;
morning, all who could read -might&#xD;
learn that a certain young female of a&#xD;
very doubtful and dangerous -charanter&#xD;
had come -to that neighborhood, and&#xD;
established a school. -'The codnterfeit&#xD;
name she then bore, it would be need-&#xD;
less--the: paper hinted-to mention&#xD;
but mothers were urgently called upon&#xD;
to-.-beware!&#xD;
What-effect all this might have, may&#xD;
easily be divined; alarm is-so soon ex&#xD;
cited in the breasts of women,- nd peo-&#xD;
ple, for tthe most part, so readily give&#xD;
credence to evil reports concerning&#xD;
their neighbors.&#xD;
&#xD;
158&#xD;
&#xD;
Xa. PIKE'S SCHEME PRODUCES REsULTS.&#xD;
AT the accustomed hour, Julie made&#xD;
her appearance to assist Hester before&#xD;
the school opened for the day; but, as&#xD;
the latter welcomed her with her usual&#xD;
happy smile,, the turnkey's daughter&#xD;
seemed agitated and alarmed..&#xD;
" I have seen a most strange placard&#xD;
against the walls this morning."&#xD;
"Very likely," observed   Hester,&#xD;
laughing ; " for Londonu is a strange&#xD;
place, and contains strangepeople."&#xD;
"Oh! I hope I may be mistaken.&#xD;
The school it describes as rapidly in-&#xD;
creasing cannot be "&#xD;
"But it can be.   You teach the&#xD;
smaller scholars admirably; and I be-&#xD;
lieve, my dear Julie, it is chiefly owing&#xD;
to yon that my school has become so&#xD;
flourishing."&#xD;
The poor girl caught her mistress by&#xD;
the dress. " Do not jest-; but perhaps"&#xD;
I am   deceived ; perhaps I read it-&#xD;
wrongly ; there may be other schools&#xD;
in the neighborhood."&#xD;
Hester seeing Julie so serious, and&#xD;
struck by her vague words, altered her&#xD;
manner, and asked her what she meant.&#xD;
"The infamous placard, Miss Somer-&#xD;
"Well, what does it say ?"&#xD;
"I have drawn one from the wall&#xD;
just outside," stammered Julie. "Here&#xD;
it is!"&#xD;
Hester took the square piece of red&#xD;
paper, and her eyes were riveted on it.&#xD;
At first her countenance expressed in-&#xD;
credulity, then a gradually awakening&#xD;
conviction of some dreaded fact, and&#xD;
-lastly, bitter and sharp anguish. The&#xD;
paper fell on the ground, and she moved&#xD;
backwards, sinking into a chair. Oh!&#xD;
the piteous look which Hester cast at&#xD;
Julie, as she felt that a cloud had'sud-&#xD;
denly come over the delightful prospect&#xD;
which lately spread before her1!-' He&#xD;
has found me I" she said, in a low tone&#xD;
of voice, betokening an agony words&#xD;
may not express.  All that her poor&#xD;
companion could:do was to stand b&#xD;
-her side, kiss her hand, and cover it&#xD;
with tears.  At 'length Julie spoke,&#xD;
with a-hope of encouraging her mis-&#xD;
tress.&#xD;
"Grieve not thus-may we not both&#xD;
be wrong in supposing this paperdi-&#xD;
rected against yourself? Even if it is,&#xD;

-                     +t&#xD;
&#xD;
can you not prosecute your wicked per-&#xD;
secutor ?"&#xD;
" There lies the difficulty, Julie. So&#xD;
cunning and-cautious is this man, that&#xD;
while we are certain of his evil deeds,&#xD;
we have no proof to convict hini in a&#xD;
court of justice. You observe, no ad-&#xD;
dress is given on this placard-no real&#xD;
name ; and the 'Society,' put forth so&#xD;
pompously, is merely an imaginary one.&#xD;
But people will believe.all!" she cried,&#xD;
yielding again to her wild grief-" be-&#xD;
lieve all, and I am ruined !"&#xD;
"But wait the event--be patient for&#xD;
a short time," suggested Julie. "Per-&#xD;
haps we shall find every fear ground-&#xD;
less. Yes, yes, no doubt all the scho-&#xD;
lars will attend as usual."&#xD;
Hester listened to her companion;&#xD;
but it was not without great anxiety&#xD;
that she tarried for the hour when the&#xD;
pupils were accustomed5to:flock to the&#xD;
school. That hour came ; two children&#xD;
only appeared. , Still she waited, and&#xD;
expected ; but so well had Mr. Pike's&#xD;
measures succeeded, that not one more&#xD;
arrived.  The -parents of' these two&#xD;
children were all out of, the. entire&#xD;
number who did not attend to, and be-&#xD;
lieve, the malicious statements, of the&#xD;
attorney. Even these 'children evinced&#xD;
a kind of shrinking and fear, and spoke&#xD;
of letters given them by some gentle-&#xD;
man on thepreceding day.&#xD;
About an hour had passed, when&#xD;
several women were seen entering to-&#xD;
gether Wardrobe-place. Their steps&#xD;
were hurried, and their eyes sparkled&#xD;
with anger. They looked at each other&#xD;
in surprise, for their business seemed&#xD;
to be the same. By a simultaneous&#xD;
.movement they advanced to the house&#xD;
where Hester resided, and so eager&#xD;
were they to gain admittance that two&#xD;
or three extended their hands to the&#xD;
knocker together. The unsuspecting&#xD;
Jalie opened the door,-and the women,&#xD;
without naming their business, in-&#xD;
stantly proceeded to the school-room.&#xD;
"You are here, then-?" said the fore-&#xD;
most woman,, throwing back her hair&#xD;
from her'inflamed cheeks.&#xD;
"'Found out at last!i" exclaimed a&#xD;
second.&#xD;
"Oh, what hypocrisy and guilt'we&#xD;
have around us in this evil world'!"&#xD;
cried a third,' sentimentally lifting her&#xD;
hands and eyes.&#xD;
Hester'noved back from the group&#xD;
with feelings;of terror, but they kept&#xD;
gradually-advancing upon her.&#xD;

" What do you mean? Please e4-&#xD;
plain yourselves, I beseech you."&#xD;
" Oh!1 that's of- no use !" cried the&#xD;
foremost-; "you know.your own cha-&#xD;
racter, young woman, so you cannot be&#xD;
ignorant of our business."&#xD;
"We are come, ma'am," said ano-&#xD;

bin's, Mrs. Montmorency's, and Mrs.&#xD;
Stubbs's sentiments-we are come just&#xD;
to speak our mind, and serve you as&#xD;
you deserve."&#xD;
Again the group drew nearer, and&#xD;
their gestures became more threaten-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"We love virtue, ma'am; and gen-&#xD;
tility," said the sentimental one, "and&#xD;
you appeared to possess both; therefore&#xD;
we loved you, and sent our poor inno-&#xD;
cent children to your school. Our eyes&#xD;
*are opened now. Your ;school would&#xD;
be to them the nursery of perdition,&#xD;
and the road to the gallows.-Oh, un-&#xD;
happy young female I what mercy can&#xD;
you expect at our hands ?"&#xD;
The other women applauded this lit-&#xD;
tle speech ;{but Julie, perceiving their&#xD;
passions grow every moment more vio-&#xD;
lent, threw herself before them, and&#xD;
endeavored to plead on behalf of her&#xD;
beloved mistress.&#xD;
-"What. !"cried they, "are you in&#xD;
league? ?and do you both pretend not&#xD;
to understand us yet? At least, then,&#xD;

enlightened, and how -poor deluded&#xD;
mothers have been warned to save their&#xD;
offspring from contamination and ruin&#xD;
-thanks to that excellent Society for&#xD;
the Abolition of Vice I"&#xD;
Each woman now drew forth Mr.&#xD;
Pike's letter; Hester eagerly seized one,&#xD;
and read it. as well as her swimming&#xD;
eyes and sinking frame would permit&#xD;
her. The women regarded her in bit-&#xD;
ter and-silent indignation, yet curious&#xD;
to observe hew she might bear the full&#xD;
'discovery of'her presumed guilt.&#xD;
The:plausibility, the hellish cunning-&#xD;
displayed bylthe writer, surpassed even&#xD;
what she mighthave expected from her&#xD;
persecutor Pike., She could no longer&#xD;
blame-the conduct of those before her,&#xD;

even more. exasperated,.;During -that&#xD;
morning, her nerves;had undergone a&#xD;
strain siufciently severe; this 'last&#xD;
stroke exceeded 'almostwhat nature-&#xD;

&#xD;
she could exclaim ; and the poor victim&#xD;
of her father's enemies, like a flower&#xD;
bowed down to the earth by the step of&#xD;
some reckless passer-by, seemed crush-&#xD;
ed by the weight of her calamity, for&#xD;
she sank, without sense or motion, into&#xD;
the arms of Julie.  4&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER'S nIFE IN DANGER--THE DISTRESS&#xD;
of THE IMPRISONED FATHER.&#xD;
IT was nearly twelve o'clock, and the&#xD;
night was profoundly still. The spar-&#xD;
rows= were 'asleep in the trees of the&#xD;
little square ; the overlabored mechanic&#xD;
had crept to his bed ;, and the measured&#xD;
step of the police on the pavement was&#xD;
the only sound that fell at intervals on&#xD;
the ear.&#xD;
Wearily drag on the hours of night&#xD;
to the sick who cannot sleep.p The cur-&#xD;
tains were drawn around the bed; on&#xD;
the floor stood the shaded candle; ,the&#xD;
small table displayed sundry bottles&#xD;
with labels, some being half emptied of&#xD;
their contents; there, too, the divided&#xD;
orange spoke of the patient's thirst-&#xD;
grateful fruit, which fever and pain&#xD;
hold dear, and even the dying loveI&#xD;
Mohammed should have placed it in&#xD;
his paradise, to bloom by the. rivers of&#xD;
amber, and by the throne of Allah.&#xD;
An anxious quiet reigned in that&#xD;
room. Two persons were watching the&#xD;
sick;, an elderly . gentleman, with a&#xD;
placid, benevolent face, sat near the&#xD;
head of the bed: notwithstanding the&#xD;
great danger in which the patient lay,&#xD;
he was perfectly calm, as a medical&#xD;
man ever should be. His- gold repeater&#xD;
rested on his knees, and every now and&#xD;
then he consulted. it, as he stretched&#xD;
out his hand to feel the pulse of the&#xD;
invalid. .Occasionally a smile softened&#xD;
his Wrinkled countenace, but it was&#xD;
quickly succeeded by an expression of-&#xD;
anxiety and severe thought : he was&#xD;
evidently watching a crisis.&#xD;
The other attendant was the turn-&#xD;
key's daughter; and she stood by the&#xD;
.table, in readiness to give to the doctor&#xD;
anything that might be required.,The&#xD;
anguish of the heart was checked, lest&#xD;
it might interfere withthe duties of the&#xD;
nurse;,but it was not felt the less. Her&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes might be filled with tears, and her&#xD;
bosom might be bursting, yet not for&#xD;
an instant did Julie turn away to vent.&#xD;
her natural feelings: there she re-&#xD;
mained by the doctor's -side, all eye&#xD;
and ear, only at times stooping forward,&#xD;
and cautiously moving back the curtain&#xD;
to look for a moment on her who was&#xD;
so near the portal of death.&#xD;
Yes, occasioned by the severe conflict&#xD;
of her harrowing feelings, since her last&#xD;
hopes had been crushed by the ma-&#xD;
noeuvres of Mr. Pike, Hester had been&#xD;
seized with a fever: it was one which&#xD;
did not affect the brain, but the disease&#xD;
had taken a very dangerous form. And&#xD;
there she lay on the pillow, calm and&#xD;
still as the night around them, but&#xD;
feeble as an infant. Her forehead, not&#xD;
contracted' by pain, was smooth and&#xD;
beautiful, but her face had no. hue of&#xD;
life, except a red spot burning in the&#xD;
centre of the cheeks. Her eyes were&#xD;
half closed, the long lashes shading the&#xD;
blue, as. strips of black cloud conceal&#xD;
the azure of the "rainy April" heaven.&#xD;
Her hair (they had not found it neces-&#xD;
sary to deprive her of that adornment)&#xD;
lcy in its dishevelled length over the&#xD;
pillow and on the coverlet of the bed-&#xD;
golden, wavelike, abundant hair, such&#xD;
as the heads of angels are painted&#xD;
with-hair, the loveliness of which dis-&#xD;
ease cannot affect, and death would not&#xD;
triumph over.&#xD;
No word, 'no groan fell from the lips&#xD;
of Hester; she continued without mo-&#xD;
tion, and apparently without breathing.&#xD;
Julie now whispered into the surgeon's&#xD;
ear:--&#xD;
"Has the crisis you speak of passed ?"&#xD;
The medical man did 'not answer,&#xD;
but placed his finger on his lip,'and.&#xD;
the profound quiet was unbroken dur-&#xD;
ing another hour; then, for the first&#xD;
time that night, Hester feebly spoke&#xD;
"Where is he-my father ?"&#xD;
Julie looked painfully at the surgeon.&#xD;
She -knew the reason why Mr. Somerset&#xD;
was not there, but felt reluctant to name&#xD;
it to Ifester:-&#xD;
" My dear young lady," said the doc-&#xD;
tor, ."do not distress yourself about&#xD;
that now."   -&#xD;
"I must see him."&#xD;
"He.will be here in the morning."&#xD;
"The, morning ?"-Hester paused,&#xD;
and sighed-" I shall not-live-to see&#xD;
the morning."'&#xD;
"Oh! yes, yes, you will, my dearest&#xD;
'child," said the good man encourag-&#xD;
&#xD;
ingly; "and many mornings more, I&#xD;
hope."&#xD;
" Let me see him. Is he reluctant&#xD;
to look on death? Is his fear of being&#xD;
infected by my complaint stronger than&#xD;
his love ?"&#xD;
Julie now scrupled no longer; she&#xD;
resolved to tell the truth, and the medi-&#xD;
cal man gave her liberty to speak.&#xD;
"You do your father wrong,- dear&#xD;
Miss Somerset, in 'supposing him un-&#xD;
willing to come. When he left this&#xD;
afternoon, we believed you better. I&#xD;
have been to the prison to-night, but&#xD;
unfortunately the hour was past when&#xD;
the mates have liberty to go out on&#xD;
payment of money. The turnheys re-&#xD;
fused, on any consideration, to permit&#xD;
him to quit the walls."&#xD;
" Not even to see, his dying child !&#xD;
Oh ! cruel laws of the hard and merci-&#xD;
less ! but let it be," continued Hester,&#xD;
turning her head on the pillow. "I&#xD;
can pray for him, if I cannot see him;&#xD;
I can bless him, if I cannot weep my&#xD;
last tears in his arms. Father, you are&#xD;
growing - old ; trials and -misfortunes&#xD;
will shorten your natural days-it will&#xD;
not be long, ere we shall meet again."&#xD;
Her look was placid and resigned, and&#xD;
the expression of her face was one, of&#xD;
trust and hopefulness. Her lips niur'&#xD;
mured at intervals: "Bless thee-bless&#xD;
thee-God protect thee! May some&#xD;
kind heart at last do that for which I&#xD;
have labored in vain-give thee liberty;&#xD;
and-may thy closing days be yet bright&#xD;
and happy .&#xD;
" Who is this loitering in the pass&#xD;
sage ?" said one of the chief officials of&#xD;
the Fleet Prison to the turnkey then&#xD;
doing duty at the gate.&#xD;
"'Tis No. 10, inner-yard, Mr. Somer-&#xD;
set, sir."&#xD;
"Mr. Somerset ?-what does the man&#xD;
want here? 'Tis time -he were in his&#xD;
bed: you know the new rules-prison--&#xD;
ers are not to keep these late hours."&#xD;
" I've ordered him baeh to his room,&#xD;
sir; buthe'won't go.".&#xD;
"Disobedient 2-disorderly-eh:? We&#xD;
will soon-see what he means by this."&#xD;
Saying:which, the gentleman function-&#xD;
ary strode up to the prisoner,who was&#xD;
leaning against the wall near a lamp,&#xD;
his eyes fixed on the prison door open-&#xD;
ing into the ,street. -He did not at first&#xD;
hear the voice of theyperson 'who ac-&#xD;
costed him. "What! do:you pretend&#xD;

"But may I not see her ?" stammered&#xD;
out Mr. Somerset, in his delight.&#xD;
" Certainly : only piomiseto be calm,&#xD;
for we must be careful not to agitate&#xD;
her nerves. I will return to the room&#xD;
with you."&#xD;
Quietly Hester lay in the embracing&#xD;
arms of her father. Happy she felt,&#xD;
and grateful as happy.&#xD;
"  thank God," she whispered, "for&#xD;
this. He has heard my prayer for your&#xD;
sake ; a little longer shall I be spared&#xD;
to love you, father, to be near you, and&#xD;
to hope-hope that your present mis-&#xD;

than the loss of which he could con-_&#xD;
ceive no stroke or affliction more ter-&#xD;
rible. "In a word, you can't and you&#xD;
sha'n't leave the prison. Return to your&#xD;
room, or I shall order the turnkeys to&#xD;
drag you there by force."&#xD;
The wretched father, perceiving that&#xD;
all was over, yielded to his fate.. He&#xD;
addressed not another word to the in-&#xD;
human man who thus controlled his&#xD;
destiny, but slowly walked back to the&#xD;
prison yard, where his own apartment,&#xD;
was situated. There he passed the re-&#xD;
mainder of the night in anxiety and&#xD;
sorrow only to be imagined; Yet he&#xD;
was not alone, for Reuben insisted on&#xD;
sitting up with him, the poor turnkey,&#xD;
in his rude and honest way, endeavor-&#xD;
ing to render him consolation.&#xD;
The morning-the prayed-for morn-&#xD;
in g-at, length dawned.  The, usual&#xD;
liberty-ticket was procured, and the&#xD;
moment the rules allowed, eight o'clock,&#xD;
the ,impatient father hurried through&#xD;
the opened gate of the prison. With&#xD;
feverish haste he passed up Ludgate--&#xD;
hill, and a few minutes brought him to&#xD;
Doctors' Commons. As he drew near&#xD;
to Wardrobe-place, his anxiety and&#xD;
suspense were intolerable.  Did his&#xD;
child live ? or was she no more,? Dread&#xD;
and hope alternately filled his heart.&#xD;
He reached the covered passage, and&#xD;
entered the little square; there his agi-&#xD;
tation became so excessive, that ' his-&#xD;
palpitating heart seemed as though it&#xD;
would burst his bosom, while his knees&#xD;
smote each other.&#xD;
He saw the house-the shutters-were&#xD;
not closed-thank Heaven for that !&#xD;
Death, at least, was not there. He&#xD;
knocked softly, and the door was opened&#xD;
by a servant-girl. He was too much'&#xD;
excited to ask a question, but at that&#xD;
instant the surgeon was descending the&#xD;
stairs. The good gentleman had been&#xD;
sitting up all the night, and was now&#xD;
going home to obtain some rest. As -he&#xD;
saw Mr. Somerset, he hurried forward&#xD;
to meet him. There was no shaking of&#xD;
the head-no gloom now in that benevo-&#xD;
lent face. Oh! what a light his smile east&#xD;
on the darkness of the father's soul!&#xD;
" Good-morning," said the doctor,&#xD;
taking Mr. Sopierset cheerfully by the&#xD;
hand; "I am the bearer of happy tid-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE COTTAGE AT BROMPTON.&#xD;
THEY removed the invalid, whose&#xD;
health was daily improving, to Bromp-&#xD;
ton-a locality generally esteemed for&#xD;
theinildness of the air. She would.not&#xD;
consent to reside at a greater distance&#xD;
from her father ; and an hour's drive&#xD;
would-take her from that place to the&#xD;
Fleet Prison.&#xD;
Brompton was not then, as- now, to&#xD;
accommodate a plethoric ,and over-&#xD;
grown population, covered with bricks&#xD;
and mortar. Green fields refreshed the:&#xD;
eye of the exploring and adventurous&#xD;
citizen. For Bow-bells, and the. crush&#xD;
of wagons in Thames-street, he -heard&#xD;
here the low of cattle and the bleat of&#xD;
sheep;' the thrush sang in the thickets,&#xD;
and the winds that, sweeping over east-&#xD;
ward-spreading London, whirled about&#xD;
only dust and smoke, were=here sur-&#xD;
prised and gratified at being able to&#xD;
load their pinions with rich fragrance,&#xD;
breathed upwards: from countless gar-&#xD;
dens.&#xD;
Oh! ye destroyers ! Civilization and.&#xD;
advancing Prosperity lye arch-enemies&#xD;
to Nature and Nature's delights-! that&#xD;
scene now is blotted out.-The tuneful&#xD;
blackbird has winged away to regions.&#xD;
that still offer a covert ; the lowing cat-&#xD;
tle have been driven to Smithfield, and&#xD;

A&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
waved, where hawthorn-hedges divided&#xD;
the velvet meadows, and the odorous&#xD;
gardens laughed in the awakening eye&#xD;
of day, little now is seen but long, long&#xD;
rows of red-brick domiciles-a wilder&#xD;
ness of chimney-pots, which discharge&#xD;
their black or yellow clouds, generated&#xD;
by inferior "Inland" or Wallsend&#xD;
coals ; while omnibuses-, rattle along,&#xD;
and legions of shops-draper, grocer,&#xD;
and costermonger-stare at the sorrow-&#xD;
ful muserr from every corner. Alas!&#xD;
for that once rural suburb-for 'plea-&#xD;
sant, pleasant Brompton-!&#xD;
The cottage in which Hester lodged&#xD;
belonged to a gardener. It- was not&#xD;
surrounded by trees, for medical men&#xD;
have an aversion to trees, shutting out&#xD;
the free air, and breathing at night&#xD;
pernicious gases into windows ; but it.&#xD;
stood embosomed among flowers and-&#xD;
aromatic shrubs. The place was near&#xD;
to'London, and yet so retired, so still,&#xD;
so rural, that it well might seem a&#xD;
hundred miles away.&#xD;
The afternoon is warm, the air soft&#xD;
and sweet, as-if breathing over Shak-&#xD;
speare's " bank of violets."  Hester is&#xD;
resting on a rustic seat near the porch&#xD;
of the cottage. Her faithful attendant,&#xD;
Julie, is also there, for the turnkey's&#xD;
daughters=now seldom quits her side.&#xD;
Each has a book in her hand, but they&#xD;
seem wrapped in their own thoughts,&#xD;
heeding,not the page over which they.&#xD;
bend.- The eyes of Julie now wander&#xD;
across the garden, then along the mea-'&#xD;
dows beyond, and, lastly, are fixed on&#xD;
the ,crimson clouds which are begin-&#xD;
ning -in the west to roll themselves,&#xD;
around the sinking sun. There is an&#xD;
expression of simple wonder, and in-&#xD;
tense adoration, in the young girl's&#xD;
look, as if she sees in those masses of&#xD;
gorgeousness and glory the sky-throne&#xD;
of Nature's:God.; or fancies she looks&#xD;
through their long vistas of branching&#xD;
gold into paradise. Hester watches&#xD;
her, and, as the rays grow -deeper and&#xD;
richer, their reflection is cast on each,&#xD;
girl's countenance, on their long, wavy&#xD;
hair, and on their garments, until they&#xD;
appear surrounded by an atmosphere&#xD;
of soft and living'purple.&#xD;
Heliotropes turning to the sun seemed-&#xD;
those fair, motionless eings--worship-&#xD;
pers of the Persian Mithra, praying in&#xD;
sileice, and mourning that the God-of&#xD;
Day should number now so few disci-&#xD;
ples on earth. Hester at length spoke,&#xD;
to her companion:-&#xD;
&#xD;
"You admire the scene, Julie. It&#xD;
does not much resemble the prospect&#xD;
which, for twenty years, spread before&#xD;
you within the walls of the Fleet Pri-&#xD;
soti ?"     1&#xD;
" No, Miss Somerset ; but I told you&#xD;
I was once at Hampstead,-and father&#xD;
said the scene there is the finest in the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
i' Then Reuben has been a travel-&#xD;
ler ?"&#xD;
"He says so, for he has been at Bar-&#xD;
net, .at Norwood, at Gravesend, and&#xD;
even at Margate. I once thought, the&#xD;
last place was almost at the end of the&#xD;
world ; but, thanks to your teaching, I&#xD;
know better now."&#xD;
"Yes, by reading and by patient&#xD;
study, Julie, you are advancing won.&#xD;
derfully.  That mind of yours is a&#xD;
bright star which has long been ob-&#xD;
scured by the mists and clouds of igno-&#xD;
rance ; these fogs are fast passing&#xD;
away."'&#xD;
" Would that they were ! but I am&#xD;
still a poor, ignorant, uncultivated, and&#xD;
blind being. I feel I was born to serve,&#xD;
and to look up to another for direction.&#xD;
I do not understand the feeling that&#xD;
prompts some to elevate themselves&#xD;
above their fellow-creatures. Ambition&#xD;
seems to me a curse rather than a no-&#xD;
ble passion -of the mind. My happi-&#xD;
ness has been, and I trust long will be,&#xD;
to wait on and serve you."&#xD;
"Now, Julie, you are- most obsti-&#xD;
nate. I tell you again, you are not my&#xD;
servant, but my companion and friend.&#xD;
For your care of me, and your unwea-&#xD;
ried attention during my late illness, I&#xD;
owe you a debt I shall never be- able to&#xD;
discharge. Listen to me. ' Shall we&#xD;
henceforth live entirely together, toil&#xD;
on together, and assist each other in&#xD;
buffeting the assaults of fortune-sworn&#xD;
friends in good and evil ?"&#xD;
." That is too much to hope, far too&#xD;
much for me to expect. Your proposal&#xD;
overwhelms me with happiness, and-yet&#xD;
fills me with sorrow-sorrow, because&#xD;
I am so unworthy of your regard."&#xD;
.." Dear Julie," said Hester, " you are&#xD;
all I ask, all I desire in a friend.-&#xD;
Would that a nearer tie than friend-&#xD;
ship's existed between us !"&#xD;
"A  nearer tie ?-you must mea,&#xD;
then, that of a cousin or a sister ; such&#xD;
a thing to me would be strange, yet in-&#xD;
expressibly delightful, for I have no re-&#xD;
lation in the world but my father and&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER       SOMERSET.&#xD;

&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Remember me, when stars unclose&#xD;
Their golden lattices on high,&#xD;
To watch, like angels, Earth's repose,&#xD;
And soften Sorrow's tear and sigh.&#xD;
For oh! my heart can ne'er forget&#xD;
The joyous days of life's sweet prime;,&#xD;
The rose of Memory bloometh yet,&#xD;
Unseared hy grief, undimmed by time.&#xD;
Lands, seas, our lots may severwide,&#xD;
In fancy's dresm I'm still with thee, r&#xD;
Unchanged, still thine, whate'er betide-&#xD;
Repay my truth, remember me!&#xD;
how often are trifles, or what appear&#xD;
to be accidents, followed by important&#xD;
results i ,While Hester had been sing-&#xD;
ing, and, in the fervor of the moment,&#xD;
singing, perhaps,, with a greater degree&#xD;
of pathos and power than she had dis-&#xD;
played on any former occasion, a gen-&#xD;
tleman, walking in the. path beyond&#xD;
the garden,,might have been observed&#xD;
to stop. He was listening attentively.&#xD;
A  hedge of prickly holly completely&#xD;
screened him from the viewof the two&#xD;
companions. ' As Hester proceeded, he&#xD;
appeared fascinated and struck, while&#xD;
an approving smile, such as a connois-&#xD;
seur, when pleased, betrays, lit up his&#xD;
countenance.    Creeping  under the&#xD;
hedge, the stranger drew   nearer to&#xD;
the songstress; and when     she had&#xD;
finished her warbling notes, that had&#xD;
seemed to thrill the air, as if poured&#xD;
forth by some spirit of the flowers, the&#xD;
charmed listener stood motionless and&#xD;
thoughtful.  Yet he speedily formed&#xD;
a resolution, for he entered the garden&#xD;
gate,;and, advanced without ceremony&#xD;
to the bench where Hester and Julie&#xD;
sat.,&#xD;
He was a man :above sixty years of&#xD;
age, of the middle height, and dressed&#xD;
in black: his appearance was gentle-&#xD;
manly, and his countenance singularly&#xD;
mild and prepossessing. As-he ap-&#xD;
proached, he slightly lifted his hat.&#xD;
"I have to beg athousand pardons,"&#xD;
he said, looking at Hester, "for the&#xD;
liberty which Itake in accosting you;&#xD;
but fear and surprise must be my&#xD;
pleas:  fear that, since you   are a&#xD;
stranger, remaining'at Bronpton pro-&#xD;
bably but a short time, I may not see&#xD;
you again-and surprise at what I&#xD;
have this moment heard._ Do not be&#xD;
angry with me, my dear young lady;&#xD;
as you perceiveI am an old ,man with&#xD;
a white head, and. am.more suited to&#xD;
act the father than to playthe lover."&#xD;
The gentleman smiled so benevo-&#xD;
lently, that Hester felt her heart warm&#xD;
towards him.         -&#xD;
&#xD;
"That is my house yonder among&#xD;
the trees, and I have .occupied it now&#xD;
thirty years. I have a wife and three&#xD;
daughters-my name is---"&#xD;
Hester started.&#xD;
What ! sir, have I the honor to be&#xD;
addressed by the great composer and&#xD;
professor of music of that name ?-a&#xD;
name long familiar to me ? '&#xD;
The gentleman, whom we shall call&#xD;
Kellerman, again smiled.&#xD;
" Not great, but little-a gleaner in&#xD;
the wide field of art, after the renowned&#xD;
masters who have preceded me. But&#xD;
if I still compose a few bars, I can sing-&#xD;
no more,; my voice is broken and de-&#xD;
parted, and yet I am passionately fond&#xD;
of singing. ,In a word, I am in search&#xD;
of some voice-some English female&#xD;
voice, which, by training and tuition,&#xD;
may eclipse the voices of these foreign&#xD;
ladies, with whom, to the disgrace of&#xD;
English art, our country is inundated.&#xD;
I think," added the professor,. "you&#xD;
have never appeared in public, for&#xD;
your face is quite unknown to me.".&#xD;
"Never," said Hester,,quickly.&#xD;
" Pardon my presumption--I know&#xD;
not your position or your prospects in&#xD;
life ; but should they not be adverse to&#xD;
my views, then, I believe, judging from&#xD;
what I have heard, my search is over.",&#xD;
." I cannot understand you. I am&#xD;
no singer-I have no voice."&#xD;
"Forgive me if I differ from you :&#xD;
the ear that has attended to musical,&#xD;
sounds for forty years mustneeds have&#xD;
some quickness of appreciation. A&#xD;
dozen notes always enable me to judge&#xD;
hether a voice is worthy of being cul-&#xD;
tivated.  Allow me, then, to repeat,&#xD;
my search is over."'&#xD;
" No, no," said Hester, laughing&#xD;
outright ; "you must, at least, be mis-&#xD;
taken here. I have no musical talents&#xD;
-no strength of lungs, or execution ;&#xD;
and every person who is acquainted&#xD;
with me knows it."&#xD;
But the professor was persevering.&#xD;
"°I am no idle enthusiast in the art,&#xD;
my dear young lady-I always form&#xD;
quiet, unbiased judgments, and I tell&#xD;
you I am right. But to be very plain&#xD;
--are your predilections against culti-&#xD;
vating your natural talent, or would&#xD;
you bie famous and gain much money?&#xD;
--the matter rests entirely with your-&#xD;
self."'&#xD;
The earnest and serious manner of&#xD;
Mr. Kellerman fixed Hester's atten-&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET;&#xD;
&#xD;
tion. Surprised, as she might be, she&#xD;
was compelled to believe him sincere.&#xD;
" I am willing to improve any poor&#xD;
talent I may possess ;. but, believe me,&#xD;
I have no ambition to be famous. If,&#xD;
however, I thought money could be&#xD;
gained-"&#xD;
" To be sure it could. Then you are&#xD;
desirous of gaining money? You are&#xD;
too young, I know, to love gold for&#xD;
its own sake ; but you wish to obtain&#xD;
a livelihood, perhaps ;-let that neces-&#xD;
sity act as a spur."&#xD;
t I want it," said Hester, hesitating-&#xD;
ly, "not for myself, but my father.&#xD;
He is unfortunate. -Oh ! if"I could&#xD;
get money-that is, sufficient -he&#xD;
would be happy again.'&#xD;
Mr. Kellerman seemed to read a tale&#xD;
in the expressive countenance of the&#xD;
speaker, for he regarded her thought-&#xD;
fully for several minutes.&#xD;
"Not ffe worlds," he said, at length,&#xD;
"would I pry into your domestic af-&#xD;
fairs ; but perhaps your father is in&#xD;
embarrassed circumstances ?"&#xD;
"He is," said Hester-" he is more&#xD;
than embarrassed, sir-he is in pri-&#xD;
son."&#xD;
"For child-poor gentleman !" said&#xD;
the professor. " And can no one as-&#xD;
sist him ?"&#xD;
" His only relative persecutes him,&#xD;
and they who were his friends con-&#xD;
.sider his misfortunes deserved, for he&#xD;
lost his property in speculation; so-no&#xD;
one will help him in the hour of need.&#xD;
havee been endeavoring to 'do some-&#xD;
thing-yet, shame on me ! during six&#xD;
years; I have saved little or nothing.&#xD;
True, I have had my misfortunes---the&#xD;
will is strong, but the hand is weak."&#xD;
"You are a good child, and a dutiful&#xD;
daughter ; but what can you possibly&#xD;
do'? No doubt the sum for which he&#xD;
is detained is large."&#xD;
"It is," said Hester..&#xD;
"Many thousands ?"&#xD;
"No; about five hundred pounds."&#xD;
Mr. Kellerman smiled.&#xD;
"Upon my word," he exclaimed,-&#xD;
"sad is the existing state of the law,&#xD;
which suffers a gentleman to be de-&#xD;
prived of his"liberty for years on ac-&#xD;
count of-such a paltry sum."&#xD;
Hester stared. The sum, to her, by&#xD;
brooding over it, and .dreaming of it,&#xD;
had become of fearful magnitude.&#xD;
"A paltry amount,, I say--that is,-&#xD;
speaking comparatively.  Why, my&#xD;
dear young lady, if I -did not think, in&#xD;
&#xD;
161&#xD;
&#xD;
one year, you could gain double as&#xD;
much by the, exercise of your voice,&#xD;
never should I advise you to cultivate&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Oh! impossible-you ,dream,;. the.&#xD;
very thought of such a thing fills my&#xD;
heart with delight."&#xD;
"Then be guided by me; consent to&#xD;
study and practise under my tuition.&#xD;
Your advance, I am persuaded, will be&#xD;
rapid."&#xD;
" How long do you imagine it would&#xD;
be necessary for me to remain as your&#xD;
pupil?"&#xD;
" That entirely depends on your ca-&#xD;
pabilities-probably fifteen months, or&#xD;
it may be two years."&#xD;
Hester shook her head, and her&#xD;
happy smile vanished.&#xD;
"I thank you, sir; but it will not do.&#xD;
Even if I possessed talents - a very&#xD;
questionable thing-I could not neglect&#xD;
other duties, and means of "gaining a&#xD;
livelihood,. during that protracted pe-&#xD;
riod. The truth is, I have to support&#xD;
myself, and make a small allowance to&#xD;
my father in prison."&#xD;
The professor paused, his eyes being&#xD;
fixed in an absent manner on the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
" I see, I see ; by working honestly&#xD;
together, we shall be mutual gainers.&#xD;
Listen to me. We can easily over-&#xD;
come the difficulty you name, for dur-&#xD;
ing the time of your tuition I. will al-&#xD;
low you a maintenance. Stay, cease,&#xD;
your surprise; I am not so generous,.&#xD;
as you imagine. In return for my out-&#xD;
lay, I should expect you to enter into.&#xD;
a certain compact--that is, agreement&#xD;
to pay me, for two years after your&#xD;
dd bt, one-half of the proceeds arising&#xD;
from the exercise of your art."&#xD;
Hester knew not what to answer.&#xD;
Her whole communication with this&#xD;
musical professor had been so, brief&#xD;
and extraordinary, and the ideas and&#xD;
expectations he entertained appeared&#xD;
to her so unwarranted and extrava-&#xD;
gant, that she- was bewildered, and&#xD;
believed him half a madman.. On the&#xD;
other hand, his fame in the world had&#xD;
been so long 'established, while his&#xD;
manner to her was so kind, that she&#xD;
could not doubt his abilities or sincer-&#xD;
ity, nor help feeling greatly interested&#xD;
in his proposals. She begged him,&#xD;
however, to grant her time for reflec-&#xD;
tion, and chiefly, she was desirous of&#xD;
askiig the advice of her father.&#xD;
'-Dy all means," said Mr. Keller-&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
A DISCOVERY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mn. SOMERSET at first expressed -a&#xD;
great objection to Mr.-Kellerman's pro-&#xD;
posal.  Family pride, or, it may be&#xD;
termed by some, prejudice, was not ex-&#xD;
tinct in his breast ; and the idea that&#xD;
his: daughter should study an art which&#xD;
would unavoidably bring her before&#xD;
the- public, much galled him. .-But&#xD;
what trials had she not already gone&#xD;
through ?-what indignities had she-&#xD;
not suffered?. And when Hester re-&#xD;
presented the possibility, although she&#xD;
doubted it in her heart, that this one&#xD;
project might free them from their&#xD;
persecutors, and all their sorrows ; and&#xD;
when Mr. Kellerman himself assured&#xD;
him how certainly Hester would com-&#xD;
mand success, and how easily obtain&#xD;
the money required, the proud man&#xD;
considered it his duty to yield. Ac-&#xD;
cordingly, he consigned his daughter to&#xD;
the care of the venerable professor,=the&#xD;
man who had recognized in her what&#xD;
others'had failed to discover; and what-&#xD;
ever the result might be, he would be&#xD;
resigned and patient.&#xD;
Hester commenced her lessons with&#xD;
little confidence, and less hope; but as&#xD;
the training of her voice, and its deve-&#xD;
lopment,-proceeded, her natural cour-&#xD;
age arose, and she resolved to conquer&#xD;
difficulties by assiduity and painstak-&#xD;
ing. The master never doubted her&#xD;
genius, but the pupil continued blind&#xD;
to it. The problem  remained to be&#xD;
solved. Hester, however, was not so&#xD;
much engrossed by her studies but that&#xD;
she found time daily to visit the Fleet&#xD;
Prison. Julie resided constantly with&#xD;
her; but far from being a burden, the&#xD;
turnkey's daughter more then earned&#xD;
her own living by the exercise of her&#xD;
needle. But we must here describe a'&#xD;
&#xD;
scene whichoccurred not long afteriHes-&#xD;
terhad entered upon hermusical career&#xD;
"Julie," she said one morning, "I&#xD;
must take you to -the prison to-day ex-&#xD;
pressly to see my father."&#xD;
" What can a gentleman like him&#xD;
care about me ?" observed the turnkey's&#xD;
daughter, as her hands were busily en&#xD;
gagedinbraiding her companion's hair.&#xD;
" He tells me that he has never yet&#xD;
spoken to you, or properly seen you;&#xD;
for when he used to come to Wardrobe&#xD;
place, during my illness, his -eyes and&#xD;
his whole attention, dear man, were&#xD;
directed to my poor self."&#xD;
"That is true ; he never, I believe,&#xD;
even glanced at me when in the room;&#xD;
and very natural it was, considering his&#xD;
daughter's situation."&#xD;
1" Well, he wishes now to return you&#xD;
his sincere thanks for all your kindness,&#xD;
to me. Let us go.&#xD;
"I want no thanks.   Stay, I have&#xD;
not yet finished your hair."&#xD;
And still the girl's fingers twined the&#xD;
silky and'glittering threads, until, her&#xD;
task being completed, she wound the&#xD;
mass round and round, coiling it up&#xD;
at the back of Hester's head, where,&#xD;
fastened by a pin, it looked like a&#xD;
beautiful serpent asleep in the sun.&#xD;
" We must, and we will go now,"&#xD;
repeated Hester.&#xD;
Julie obeyed, and the two proceeded&#xD;
together to the Fleet Prison.&#xD;
So often had the turnkeys and other;&#xD;
inmates seen the gentle, unobtrusive&#xD;
figure of Mr. Somerset's daughter pass.&#xD;
along the lobbies and steal across the&#xD;
yard, that they began to regard her ap-,&#xD;
pearance  almost as natural as the re-.&#xD;
volving days, while it was as expected&#xD;
too. Not one of the 'well-disposed but&#xD;
felt an interest in her; not one but&#xD;
would offer her a kindly greeting : even&#xD;
the coarse and the callous refrained&#xD;
their jest, and never insulted her-&#xD;
proof that virtue can make itself re-&#xD;
spected even among the profligate; and&#xD;
that filial affection and duty are regard-&#xD;
ed as beautiful things-by those to whom&#xD;
the - domestic virtues themselves are&#xD;
practically unknown.&#xD;
" Let me be at least your attendant,&#xD;
your servant here," said Julie, t'What&#xD;
will the people of the prison say if I&#xD;
talk with you familiarly? I would not&#xD;
that Mr.~Somerset should think me as-&#xD;
suming or forward';&#xD;
And the girl dropped Hester's hand,&#xD;
and walked behind her. In a few&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER MAKES-HER DEBUT AS A SINGER&#xD;
FRoM what we know of the character&#xD;
of Hester, we shall not doubt that she&#xD;
studied very diligently under the inusi&#xD;
cal professor. The more brief the term&#xD;
of her tuition, or initiation into th(&#xD;
mysteries of the art of song, the more&#xD;
speedily would her object be accom&#xD;
Polished, or,. at least, her fate decided&#xD;
Mr. 'Kellerman, himself, was surprised&#xD;
at the, progress which she made. He&#xD;
felt assured of her ability, and of the&#xD;
excellence of the voice with which Na-&#xD;
ture hadendowedher; butknowinghow&#xD;
fluctuating a thing is public taste, and&#xD;
how fashion, the whim  of the hour,&#xD;
sweeps all before it, he could not gua-&#xD;
rantee for her that triumph which&#xD;
others, far less gifted, have achieved.&#xD;
At the earnest request of Mr. Somer-&#xD;
set, Hester was to assume another&#xD;
name ; hence heA identity, when she&#xD;
might appear before the public, would&#xD;
not be discovered. She had resolved,&#xD;
too, never to sing on the stage, but to&#xD;
confine herself to the concert-room.&#xD;
Time passed. Week after week, and&#xD;
month after month, did Hester practise&#xD;
and toil. She spent hours daily with&#xD;
the venerable professor; and when by&#xD;
herself, the poor;songstress.would-shut&#xD;
herself in her room, warbling, those&#xD;
notes which she hoped, ere long, might&#xD;
avail to melt away the iron bonds-of&#xD;
her father's captivity. . -&#xD;
The chorister of the green-wood sings,&#xD;
amuse himself, and give vent to the&#xD;
exuberant joy of his swelling heart.&#xD;
The cantatrice of theopera burns-for&#xD;
fame,.or her every note is a sordid one,&#xD;
exchanged for, a coin-money that is&#xD;
to minister perhaps to her own gratifi-&#xD;
cation and luxuries. But neither for&#xD;
&#xD;
165&#xD;
&#xD;
s. amusement, fame,' nor' self-aggrandize-&#xD;
d meant, did the young pupil of Keller-&#xD;
's man pour from her dulcet throat the&#xD;
g magic of sweet sounds. She dreaded&#xD;
g notoriety, shrank from  popular-ap-&#xD;
e plause, and the thoughts of her ap-&#xD;
w preaching debt filled her ,heart with a&#xD;
. fear little short of any agony. Yet ies-&#xD;
i- ter felt that, having entered upon the&#xD;
s undertaking, the terrible trial must be&#xD;
s gone through.&#xD;
-   It -cane at last-the day on which&#xD;
she was to make her appearance-the&#xD;
day when she should be rewarded for&#xD;
her long and unremitted studies, !or,&#xD;
meeting with no. success, be thrown&#xD;
back again on her-own resources, her&#xD;
. time lost,: and farther than ever from&#xD;
the goal of her hopes and wishes.&#xD;
r   The occasion was a grand concert of&#xD;
e sacred music, to be held- at Willis's&#xD;
- Rooms. The projector Wasthe veteran&#xD;
Kellerman, and one of the pieces to be&#xD;
e performed was Handel's "Messiah?&#xD;
It being the height of the London sea-&#xD;
- son, the concert, it was expected, would&#xD;
. be very fully and fashionably attended.&#xD;
Hester proceeded in a.carriage -from&#xD;
Brompton, accompanied by Mr.:Keller-&#xD;
man and his three daughters. Pale&#xD;
she was and agitated; but very differ-&#xD;
ent were her feelings from those she&#xD;
experienced  two , years previously,&#xD;
when,.entrapped by-the snares of Pike&#xD;
and the hunchback, Flemming, she was-&#xD;
to be carried to a concert which existed&#xD;
only in the imaginations of those men;&#xD;
The company was assembling. There&#xD;
was a rapid whirling of carriages into&#xD;
King-street, a great letting-down of&#xD;
steps, and slamming of carriage-doors&#xD;
there was a mighty rushing to and fro&#xD;
of powdered footmen .with gilt staves,&#xD;
and. as confusion; was caused by the&#xD;
darkness, vehicle jostling against vehi-&#xD;
cle, coachmen were heard to swear on&#xD;
their broad hammer-cloths, while.the&#xD;
pushing and shoutingrof policemen,&#xD;
who -were very zealous in  endeavoring&#xD;
to restore order, had only the effect=of&#xD;
increasing the excitement and hubbub&#xD;
in a tenfold degree.&#xD;
Within 'the building; there were&#xD;
chandeliers casting a brilliant light on&#xD;
plumes, turbans, and-an indescribable&#xD;
variety of jewels..Men were there,&#xD;
critics, connoisseurs;, the Aristarchs 'of&#xD;
music, and men who, pretending to be&#xD;
no judges, could judge the best. Old&#xD;

Up sprang Mr. Pike, and, in his as-&#xD;

theatre, so he dared not- hiss, but he&#xD;
ventured to whisper to those nearest&#xD;

" Hush " said several voices at once.&#xD;
Mr. Pike, careful not to proceed too&#xD;
far, again seated himself.&#xD;
Hester, at. this critical juncture,&#xD;
-gainedher self-possession. She thought&#xD;
no more of Pike, but the idea of hin&#xD;
gave place to the image of her father;&#xD;
she saw the latter in prison, and felt&#xD;
how his future lot, his liberty, his hap-&#xD;
piness,-hung, as it :were,. on that mo-&#xD;
nent. Holy as powerful was the feel-&#xD;
ing that now sustained her ; her voice&#xD;
was no longer uncertain ; every note&#xD;
was distinct and perfect, from)the low-&#xD;
est that died away like the scarcely,&#xD;
audible murmur of the harp of Al.olus,&#xD;
to the highest that filled the room.,&#xD;
The solo-was but-half completed when&#xD;
Hester thus obtained the full command&#xD;
of her voice. The audience was now&#xD;
convinced that Kellerman's pupil was&#xD;
worthy to undertake the arduous task&#xD;
assigned her. There:was a continuous&#xD;
stream of under melody, each birdlike&#xD;
note gushing full as the nightingale's,&#xD;
yet rich.as the tones of4he flute. Anon,&#xD;
where the anthem required, the-voice&#xD;
broke forth with solemn cadence and&#xD;
sublime power; and it was truly won-&#xD;
derful that a frame so small could send'&#xD;
forth such a volume of sound. A note&#xD;
'of thrilling power, sustained.for an en-&#xD;
tire minute, took the audience by sur-I&#xD;
prise; and few present, except some oft&#xD;
the elder ones who remembered Cata-&#xD;
lani, had ever heard it equalled.&#xD;
How glowed the-eye now of the 1&#xD;
white-headed Kellerman; as he-lookedg&#xD;
around him with an air of triumph!&#xD;
"I said she 'could sing, and I knew it I"t&#xD;
were the words expressed by his mean-t&#xD;
ing looks., But hushed; was theassemn--&#xD;
bly';: not a-whisper was breathed ; for t&#xD;
each seemed wrapped in admiration of'&#xD;
the anthem, and to hang spellbound 1&#xD;
on the lips of-the youngmsinger.    t&#xD;
Hester finishedSher part at length, v&#xD;
and stepped modestly back. .:Then feel- b&#xD;
ings, long- repressed; gave themselves t&#xD;
vent,: and, like &amp;amp;pent-up whirlwind,'the t&#xD;
applause burst-foilr;not a few decorous 1&#xD;
&#xD;
rounds, but shout upon shout, each&#xD;
person vying with the other who should&#xD;
applaud the loudest. One voice only&#xD;
was heard in- dissent; it proceeded&#xD;
from the critic with red hair.&#xD;
"She is no singer-she can't sing!"&#xD;
vociferated Mr. Pike; 'she is an i.m-&#xD;
potor--I tell you her voice is execra-&#xD;
ble !"&#xD;
But a-gentleman who wa near seiz-&#xD;
ed him  by the " black-revived" coat,&#xD;
which, from1its rottenness,.threatened&#xD;
to part in his hands.&#xD;
"You are no critic, but an enemy, I&#xD;
perceive now," said the gentleman; "I&#xD;
command you to be silent, if you would&#xD;
not be choked l"&#xD;
-Then .the' applause was renewed.&#xD;
Three cheers also,-were given for the&#xD;
composer, Kellerman, whose well-earn-&#xD;
ed fame was thus enhanced by the suc-&#xD;
cessful efforts of his pupil.. Hester re-&#xD;
tired, followed by the good wishes and&#xD;
admiration of all; but, flattered as she&#xD;
could not help feeling, one thought was&#xD;
uppermost in her bosom, and,' in her&#xD;
excitement, covering her~face. with'her&#xD;
hands, she murmured,&#xD;
"Kind fortune, I thank you! Now,&#xD;
perhaps, the task will no lorigermbe im-&#xD;
possible-now I may, indeed, be, en-&#xD;
abled to gain the sum that shall setmy&#xD;
father at liberty."&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
THE SINGER'S SUCCESS--THE EQUANIMITY&#xD;
OF MR. PIKE IS DISTURBED.&#xD;
M. KELLERMAN, as well as being a&#xD;
proficient in his:prt, was acquainted&#xD;
with the world and humanmnature. He&#xD;
had promptly judged of Hester's capa-&#xD;
bilities, and judged correctly; he had&#xD;
prophesied, and .his prophecy had be-&#xD;
gun to be fulfilled. In England, as&#xD;
elsewhere, he knew that success, ob-&#xD;

&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
The professor was right.' Hester,&#xD;
under the name she has assumed,&#xD;
weekly, almost daily, increased her ce-&#xD;
lebrity.. She was eagerly sought after&#xD;
by the projectors of concerts; and the&#xD;
town being full, large audiences were,&#xD;
generally insured. The young singer&#xD;
became the rage, and not to admire her&#xD;
was considered bad taste. The result&#xD;
may be anticipated ; at the end of four&#xD;
months, when the London season clos-&#xD;
ed, the delighted Hester found her por-&#xD;
tion of the receipts to amount to no less&#xD;
a sum than five hundred and twenty&#xD;
pounds.&#xD;
Oh, blissful realization of the fond&#xD;
daughter's far-stretching dreams! After&#xD;
all her toils, her privations, her disap-&#xD;
pointments, her persecutions, is the-&#xD;
prize won-is the triumph achieved at&#xD;
last?&#xD;
But we must direct attention to ano-&#xD;
ther character in our history. Mr. Pike&#xD;
was walking to and fro in his office ;&#xD;
his manner was greatly disturbed ; a&#xD;
scowl sat on his brow, and every now&#xD;
'and then he muttered an oath.&#xD;
"What! the girl found-recognized-&#xD;
proved to be his daughter? Would I had&#xD;
-sent its tiny spirit, to heaven, instead&#xD;
of dropping the child at the prison&#xD;
gate ! Hartley is incensed-I know he&#xD;
is; he blames me for want of precau-&#xD;
tion, and I may lose my annuity-yes,&#xD;
my . annuity-my three hundred a&#xD;
year-ten thousand furies I",&#xD;
The miser, in anticipation of this&#xD;
falling off of his annual stipend, which&#xD;
hitherto had been punctually-paid him&#xD;
by Mr:. Hartley, grew  furious ; he&#xD;
groaned, and struck his forehead with&#xD;
his clenched hand.&#xD;
"Then,too, this persevering, obsti-&#xD;
nate, and miserable girl-is not her&#xD;
conduct enough to exasperate the mild-&#xD;
est spirit? -But that rascally music-&#xD;
master has been her chief assistant in&#xD;
the business; he first brought her into,&#xD;
notice, and raised a current too- strong&#xD;
for me to.oppose. Ha,-the-villain !"&#xD;
cried-Pike,grinding 'his teeth;. " what&#xD;
would I give to see him: dangling at a&#xD;
rope's end in the Old Bailey!- They are&#xD;
all getting g=the better--of-Hartley and&#xD;
me-Hartley, I tiemble to meethim-&#xD;
I dread to hear him say,'Pike,=1 must&#xD;
now stop your: salary. Oh, my three&#xD;
hundred a year i-whatewill become of&#xD;
ine in my old' age? Pshaw! that-fif-&#xD;
teen thousand which I have-in Consols,&#xD;
I won't think of it-'tis nothing ; I&#xD;
&#xD;
shall lose my annuity-I shall be a&#xD;
beggar, ruined-undone I"&#xD;
In the paroxysm of his distress, he&#xD;
struck his bony hands together, and&#xD;
tore his red hair. He then cast his&#xD;
empty purse upon the ground, type of&#xD;
himself and his dreaded expected po-&#xD;
verty,&#xD;
Mr. Pike was standing gazing on the&#xD;
purse, and ruefully shaking his head,&#xD;
when Hartley, dispensing with the&#xD;
usual ceremony of knocking, opened&#xD;
the door and walked in. The Templar&#xD;
was' not in a passion-as far as the fea-&#xD;
tures may be considered the index of&#xD;
the mind, he was calm; but there is a&#xD;
thoughtful,-quiet bitterness, a subdued&#xD;
anger, as fearful in their effects as the&#xD;
choler which breaks forth like the un-&#xD;
ruly tempest. Hartley fixed his eyes&#xD;
on the little attorney without speak-&#xD;
ing; the latter quailed and shrank, in-&#xD;
stinctively looking up, while his knees&#xD;
knocked each other..&#xD;
" No bad news-no worse intelli-&#xD;
gence, I hope, Mr. Hartley ?" said&#xD;
Pike, stooping still lower.&#xD;
"Yes," was the monosyllable.&#xD;
"Why, they surely have not disco-&#xD;
vered that we were the purloiners of&#xD;
that child, now a woman ? Oh, no, it&#xD;
is-impossible !"&#xD;
"Let that matter rest; it is a' bad&#xD;
affair,' and your doing."&#xD;
"My doing, good Mr. Hartley?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir; 'you have been outwitted.&#xD;
You played the fool; instead of trans-&#xD;
acting my business properly."'&#xD;
"-Say not so, dear sir," whispered&#xD;
Mr. Pike, in a tremulous tone. "My&#xD;
whole study has been-and still shall&#xD;
be-to serve, you, and carry out your&#xD;
wishes."&#xD;
"That- young woman ought never to&#xD;
have been restored to her family; you&#xD;
should have found her in the Fleet, and&#xD;
lured her away;anywhere-even to her&#xD;
grave-rather than have suffered such&#xD;
a discovery to take place. But let the&#xD;
matter rest; I :repeat.  The greatest&#xD;
-triumph-of our enemies is in reserve.&#xD;
Fool!,what hast thou.been doing ?'how&#xD;
hast thou tamely permitted this- mise-&#xD;
rable child of Somerset's to collect such&#xD;
a sum? Why,-sixw months have not&#xD;
elapsed since she commenced singer.&#xD;
I thought you were to attend all the&#xD;
concerts at which she was engaged, in&#xD;
order to prevent her-success ?"&#xD;
" And'so I have, -Mr. Hartley," ex-&#xD;
postulated Pike. - iverys concert and&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
musical party, to which I could gain&#xD;
admittance, have I attended+-thanks t&#xD;
you for defraying the expense of th&#xD;
tickets ; I have spoken, I have insinu&#xD;
ated, and I have hissed; but somehow&#xD;
the stupid people have not been dis&#xD;
posed to listen to my opinions. In fact&#xD;
the party got up by that rascally Kiel&#xD;
lerman, to applaud the girl, has beer&#xD;
too strong for me."&#xD;
"Wretched imbecile! knave withou&#xD;
brains !"&#xD;
"Don't blame me-don't be severe&#xD;
good Mr. Hartley," cried the eringin&#xD;
miser. "I'll do anything to serve yoi&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
" It is too late, fool."  As Hartley&#xD;
spoke, he drew a letter Irom his pocket&#xD;
"'Here, read this; I received it to-day;&#xD;
and then confess how well'you have&#xD;
served me."&#xD;
The letter was addressed to Hart-&#xD;
ley by Mr. Somerset's attorney, and,&#xD;
couched in legal phrase, gave him no&#xD;
tice that his client was now prepared to&#xD;
meet and discharge the bill of exchange,&#xD;
or promissory note, held by Roland&#xD;
Hartley, and bearing the signature of&#xD;
Hugh Somerset, in default of payment&#xD;
of which, the said Hugh Somerset had&#xD;
8o long been detained in prison. The&#xD;
said bill would be duly honored on its&#xD;
presentation .at the banking-house of&#xD;
Messrs. Candy, Sparks &amp;amp; Co.London.&#xD;
If, after this notice, the bill was not&#xD;
presented for payment, he, the attorney,&#xD;
would lave the pleasure-of waiting with&#xD;
the money at Mr. Hartley's chambers,&#xD;
demanding the delivery of the said&#xD;
promissory note, so that Mr. Somerset-&#xD;
mightforthwith-be releasedfrom prison.&#xD;
- Mr. Pike's face assumed a most me-&#xD;
lancholy and blank expression.. " This&#xD;
is, indeed, bad=--very bad," he said.&#xD;
"Who should have expected it? The&#xD;
girl, I well know, a few months since,&#xD;
through.my'assiduity in defeating her&#xD;
projects, did not possess forty pounds.&#xD;
Ah I 'tis all owing to this villain-this&#xD;
music-master, Kellerman."&#xD;
" Rather say it is owing to yourself,&#xD;
. Mr. Pike ; -you have been remiss and&#xD;
inactive."&#xD;
!- remiss! I inactive !" -.cried the&#xD;
little attorney, raising his hands and&#xD;
eyes, astounded by the charge.' "Do&#xD;
not say so, good'sir, after all mrn long&#xD;
' and faithful se vices."&#xD;
"rLook you, the money:has'been&#xD;
gained by. the daughter-my enemy&#xD;
will be r-free, -and triumph over me-I&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
n have allowed- you three hundred a&#xD;

e   " Yes, generous Mr. Hartley-three&#xD;
-hundred a yeai--I thank you."&#xD;
,   " For what purpose ?-to obtain the&#xD;
- imprisonment of my ene py, and when&#xD;
, in prison to keep him there. You suc-&#xD;
- eeded in the first-you have failed in&#xD;
n the last. Ih afew days, Somerset will&#xD;
be at large."&#xD;
t   "Confusion!" cried Pike.    "Oh,&#xD;
that the girl, Hester, could be burnt&#xD;
for a witch I"&#xD;
 "These are idle words ; our con-&#xD;
u nection must cease. Your annuity-"&#xD;
"My annuity-yes--what ?" gasped&#xD;
Pike.&#xD;
  "Must be suspended."&#xD;
"Heaven forbid !" cried the miser,&#xD;
in an agony. ".Believe me, I can still&#xD;
serve you., You can't do without rme-&#xD;
no, no, you can't do without ne 1"&#xD;
Hartley cast on the man crouching&#xD;
before him a look of withering con-&#xD;
tempt.&#xD;
.I tell thee thou art nistaken. No-&#xD;
thing now can prevent Sonierset from&#xD;
obtaining his freedom.; so- Ihave no&#xD;
further use of thee. But surely,". an,&#xD;
thou dost not covet, thy annuity any&#xD;
longer, for thou art nch enough.'?&#xD;
Rich enough!    Ohi when, did-a&#xD;
miser ever feel he was rich enough=?&#xD;
"No, I am poor, good Mr: Hartley,&#xD;
very poor, I assure you. - T only-want'&#xD;
to make a little provision for'my old&#xD;
age. Oh ! it -is a -horrible thing, the&#xD;
idea of starving when one is old and&#xD;
infirm.. If you take away my annuity,&#xD;
I shall soon want a crust-a bed' tolie&#xD;
on; but you will not be so unjust and&#xD;
cruel."&#xD;
" I can see no injustice or crtueltyirn&#xD;
the matter; I am' resolved on doing it;&#xD;
say no more."&#xD;
" Ha !" cried Pike, in a sharp ac-&#xD;
cent, looking askance at Hartley hi&#xD;
manner throwiiig off its usual abj'et&#xD;
servility, and his face assuming an e-&#xD;
pression' of viperous malignity-- I&#xD;
will have my annity-I dare you to&#xD;
stop 'the payment."&#xD;
Hartley- was astonished at thebold- -&#xD;
ness of the  an whnm he had made&#xD;
his tool.&#xD;
"I do 'not understand you, Mi-.&#xD;
Pike:"&#xD;
"I;mean, I will have my three hun-&#xD;

purer air than the-close London streets&#xD;
afford. At the same time, they pos-&#xD;
sessed the advantage of having for&#xD;
their neighbors Mr. Kellerman and&#xD;
his family, whom they might well re-&#xD;
gard in the light of protectors.&#xD;
The sisters were walking up and&#xD;
down in the flower-garde'n. The heart&#xD;
of Hester was full of joyous anticipa-&#xD;
tion, for it appeared, by the arrange-&#xD;
ments of Mr. Somerset's attorney, that&#xD;
in two or three days, at-furthest, the&#xD;
money was to be tendered to. Mr.&#xD;
Hartley; consequently-the "detainer"&#xD;
against her father would be withdrawn,&#xD;
and his dismissal from the prison, as&#xD;
a matter of course, would- -instantly&#xD;
follow.&#xD;
"Julie," said Hester, " the blissful&#xD;
moment is fast =approaching when,&#xD;
after so many years, so many hopes&#xD;
defeated, and -so many sufferings and&#xD;
privations on the part of our father, we&#xD;
shall see him free. Ought we not to&#xD;
be thankful to Heaven, and bless God's&#xD;
kind providence, which has thus heard&#xD;
the prayers of the children, and smiled&#xD;
upon their efforts ?"&#xD;
"My sister !" said Julie.  "How&#xD;
dear is that new name !. , I cannot re-&#xD;
peat it too often. You kindly couple&#xD;
our names together ; but all, all the&#xD;
credit-is due to yourself. You alone&#xD;
are the good benefactress, the giverof&#xD;
freedom and joy. to'our father."&#xD;
"No, let us share the happiness of&#xD;
having served him, as we intend to&#xD;
share everything else in the world.'&#xD;
At this instant the postman was&#xD;
seen approaching the garden gate. He&#xD;
held a letter in his hand: it was for&#xD;
Hester. She carelessly broke the seal:&#xD;
but the writing, which was a loose run-&#xD;
ning hand, was unknown to her. At&#xD;
first, so-reckless was she, that her eyes&#xD;
seemed scarcely to trouble themselves&#xD;
to glance at the words ; but, continuing&#xD;
to read, she :grew pale and agitated.&#xD;
The contents of the letter were as&#xD;
follows :-&#xD;
&#xD;
"MAAM---I make no apology for ad-&#xD;
dressing you, since I write entirely on&#xD;
business. I am one: of the clerks in&#xD;
the banking house of Messrs. C., S.,&#xD;
and Co.; and.by our books Iperceive&#xD;
you have a deposit in our hands. I&#xD;
may be acting wrong with regard to&#xD;
my employers,;or rather their-creditors,&#xD;
but having, by chance, learnt the,&#xD;
praiseworthy purpose for which your&#xD;
&#xD;
r'T&#xD;
&#xD;
money has been saved, common hu-&#xD;
manity prompts me to the disclosure&#xD;
I am about-to make. Madam, I would&#xD;
spare you a bitter pang, and I sincere-&#xD;
ly trust your poor father may obtain&#xD;
his freedom at -last. -I write, then, to&#xD;
apprise you, as a profound secret, that&#xD;
our bank is :in difficulties. The firm&#xD;
must suspend payment in a few days&#xD;
at furthest. In fact, they cannot go on.&#xD;
Consequently, your money, unless&#xD;
promptly drawn out, must be sacri-&#xD;
ficed ; for, from the state of- the eac&#xD;
counts, I much fear the firm will not&#xD;
pay one shilling in the pound. Do&#xD;
not, however, hurry yourself. Your&#xD;
check,: if presented  to-morrow, no&#xD;
doubt will be duly paid,; that is unless&#xD;
a heavy demand should be made on us&#xD;
this afternoon, in which case,,the house&#xD;
most probably will close to-morrow, and&#xD;
the firm  announce themselves bank-&#xD;
rupts.&#xD;
"I am, madam, with every feeling&#xD;
"of respect and-sympathy,&#xD;
"Your obedient servant,&#xD;
"* * -*.,&#xD;
Hester re-read theletter aloud to&#xD;
Julie, and both were in a state of ter-&#xD;
rible excitement and alarm.   What&#xD;
motives- could the clerk have in address-&#xD;
ing her but those of humanity? Sure-&#xD;
ly no mercenary feelings swayed him,&#xD;
for he would gain'nothing by disclosing&#xD;
the state of his employer'saffairs. But&#xD;
was the letter a hoax,,to raise in her&#xD;
needless fears-a forgery of their ene-&#xD;
my's ? Oh, no, reasoned Hester; it&#xD;
bore- the stamp of truthfulness and&#xD;
honesty in every line. The clerk had&#xD;
learnt her situation, and was moved by&#xD;
compassion..&#xD;
But time pressed. It was now four&#xD;
in the afternoon; and London banks,&#xD;
she knew, closed at five. To- delay&#xD;
drawing out the money until the mor-&#xD;
row might be a fatal procrastination.&#xD;
The firm might then be insolvent ; and&#xD;
the very chance of such an event it&#xD;
was dreadful to contemplate. Was&#xD;
there time to hurry to the Fleet Prison&#xD;
and consult with their father?  She&#xD;
thought not.   Hester's resolve was&#xD;
taken ; for promptness, in- cases of&#xD;
emergency, is frequently the best-po-&#xD;
licy. At her request, the master of&#xD;
the cottage ran to the nearest mews for&#xD;
a fly, and the sisters were whirled off&#xD;
to Chariag-cross, in, the vicinity of&#xD;
which-the banking-house was situated.&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSE T.&#xD;
&#xD;
WhenHester entered the bank,-she&#xD;
was rather surprised at seeing such&#xD;
large bundles of =Bank Hof England&#xD;
notes, and such piles of'gold, in the&#xD;
possession of:parties, said, by ler in-&#xD;
ormant, to be on the -point of ruin.&#xD;
But, no doubt, the sight was fallacious,&#xD;
the display of wealth being meant for&#xD;
a " blind."  She wrote the check&#xD;
hastily on the counter. Her signature&#xD;
was well known to the head clerk, and&#xD;
he did not for a moment scruple to pay&#xD;
her the full amount of her deposit.&#xD;
When she left the bank, it wanted only&#xD;
a few minutes of the-time when pub-&#xD;
lic business would be closed, and the&#xD;
poor girl congratulated herself on hav-&#xD;
ing thus saved her all from the ima-,&#xD;
ined approaching wreck,.&#xD;
It was already growing dusk, it&#xD;
being the middle of November. The&#xD;
first question that presented itself was,&#xD;
where for the night should she deposit&#xD;
'the money? p ester would have hast-&#xD;
ened to her father; but the idea of car-&#xD;
rying such a sum into the Fleet Prison,,&#xD;
where numberless rogues and sharpers&#xD;
were lodged with honest men, could&#xD;
hot be entertained. With the timidity&#xD;
and suspicion natural to those who&#xD;
earntheir money hardly, she feared to&#xD;
place it, without proper security, into&#xD;
the hands of her father's attorney.- So&#xD;
she stood on the pavement irresolute.&#xD;
Julie, too, knew not what to advise. At&#xD;
that moment a man, wrapped in a great&#xD;
coat, passed them  hurriedly, crossed&#xD;
the street, and stationed himself near&#xD;
the door of the bank which they had&#xD;
just .quitted.  There was something&#xD;
suspicious about the- person, for he&#xD;
seemed carefully to hide his face, and&#xD;
yet to peer about him quickly and&#xD;
constantly.,                -&#xD;
"That man watches us," said Hes-&#xD;
ter, uneasily, to Julie, -concealing the&#xD;
reticule'which held the money beneath&#xD;
hex cloak. " We had better, I think,&#xD;
call a' coach; and return at once to&#xD;
Brompton."&#xD;
Julie was of the same' opinion.&#xD;
"Certainly," she' suggested, "we&#xD;
may keep the money in our possession&#xD;
safely enough until to-morrow; then,&#xD;
in the broad daylight, we might go to&#xD;
our fatherland, consult with him."&#xD;
" Yes, we will ask him," said Hes-&#xD;
ter, "' if we shall not, accompany.the&#xD;
lawyer immediately to Mr. Hartley's,&#xD;
demand the delivery of tha bill he&#xD;
&#xD;
holds, and so, without further delay,&#xD;
complete the business."&#xD;
'That arrangement seemed a very&#xD;
satisfactory one to Julie; but as they&#xD;
proceeded in:the coach, Hester, look-&#xD;
ing through the window, perceived an-&#xD;
other vehicle rapidly following them.&#xD;
" Why does that cabriolet track us?"&#xD;
she observed to her companion.  In-&#xD;
to whatever street we turn, it turns&#xD;
also."&#xD;
" I saw that man in the cloak jump&#xD;
into a cabriolet as we drove off: yes,&#xD;
it is the same--I know it by the white&#xD;
horse."&#xD;
"Julie," exclaimed Hester, "I feel&#xD;
very uneasy.."&#xD;
"'Oh 1 we need not be alarmed--&#xD;
why should we ? Of course the man&#xD;
can know nothing of what we have&#xD;
with us; he only happens to be going&#xD;
the same way.\ There, he has turned&#xD;
down another street: I dare say we&#xD;
shall see-no more of him."&#xD;
Julie in this was right. They saw&#xD;
no more of him. His object, perhaps;:&#xD;
was accomplished; for be now knew&#xD;
they were proceeding home.&#xD;
Hester, by the time they had reached&#xD;
Brompton, had entirely dismissed her&#xD;
fears ; but it'was now dark, and the&#xD;
sisters did not, by any indiscreet word&#xD;
or action, betray to the gardener who&#xD;
owned the small house that they had,&#xD;
anything valuable in their possession.&#xD;
At the usual time, they .wished him&#xD;
and his wife good-night, and retired to&#xD;
their bedroom.- In spite of her usual&#xD;
self-possession, Hester could not help&#xD;
feeling great nervousness regarding:&#xD;
the safety of the money. She wished,&#xD;
when it was too late, that they had pot&#xD;
scrupled to trust her father's attorney.&#xD;
The muffled figure of the man in the&#xD;
cloak again began to haunt: her, and a&#xD;
fearful idea rose in her mind, but she&#xD;
did not mention it to Julie. Suppose,&#xD;
after all, the banker's elerk was in&#xD;
league:with some:London rogue, and&#xD;
had frightened her into a withdrawal&#xD;
of -the money only to.rob her of it I&#xD;
However base aman Mr. Pike might&#xD;
be; she could not believe he had sunk,&#xD;
so low as to become a common thief;&#xD;
and yet he might have incited the&#xD;
clerk to commit the villany,:and even&#xD;
employed the .rogue&#xD;
"What are you thinking of, lies-&#xD;
ter?  asked Julie, observing hersis-&#xD;
ter's absent manner.     -&#xD;
" Nothing, iibthing--only," whis-&#xD;
&#xD;
pered Hester, "I cannot forget that&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"Now, to me, nothing seems more&#xD;
groundless than your apprehensions."&#xD;
" You are right.'- However, I shall&#xD;
not go to bed to-night," she added in&#xD;
a scarcely audible tone; " I shall sit&#xD;
up and- watch."&#xD;
"You will -injure your health. I&#xD;
hope you will not do this."&#xD;
"It will be the safest plan. Be-&#xD;
sides, I shall be unable to close my&#xD;
eyes. Think, Julie, of-the great im-&#xD;
portance of our trust.  A  father's&#xD;
freedom  from an imprisonment that-&#xD;
might be, continued to the end of his&#xD;
life depends on the possession of this&#xD;
little packet. Yes, public taste and&#xD;
fashion are- so changeable, that, ano-&#xD;
ther season, I might be unable to save&#xD;
any money.- .Here, then-here are&#xD;
garnered all our hopes."&#xD;
"Well,. ,dear Hester, be it is you&#xD;
will; but don't think I shall rest my&#xD;
sluggard head, and leave you.to watch&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
An amiable contention now took&#xD;
place between the sisters--a conten-&#xD;
tion carried on chiefly by kisses. It&#xD;
was who should sleep; and who should&#xD;
remain awake. At length it was de-&#xD;
cided that ~they should act sentinel&#xD;
- by turns, the one alternately waking&#xD;
the other every few hours, or as they&#xD;
might feel tired.&#xD;
"We must burn a light," said Julie,&#xD;
"until daybreak."&#xD;
"Yes, it will be an additional safe-&#xD;
guard.""&#xD;
Hester resolved to watch first; her&#xD;
sister accordingly crept to her bed,&#xD;
and was soon asleep.   The money&#xD;
drawn from the bank consisted of&#xD;
Bankof England notes, being chiefly&#xD;
fives and tens, and one hundred sove-&#xD;
reigns. Suspicion and fear again had&#xD;
prompted her"to this. Had she chosen&#xD;
large notes, and any one happened to&#xD;
be forged, if it could not be :traced to&#xD;
solvent parties, the loss would be ter-&#xD;
rible.. Smallnotes, she imagined, would&#xD;
be saferpwhile sovereigns were safest&#xD;
of all. The poor girl had been cheat-&#xD;
ed so many times, and Pike had ha-&#xD;
rassed her by so many villanies, that&#xD;
this general mistrust was very natu-&#xD;
ral, and almost excusable. She had&#xD;
taken the precaution to copy on a&#xD;
sheet of paper the numbers and dates&#xD;
of the :several notes; they-formed a&#xD;
rol, whichL, -together with the sove-&#xD;
&#xD;
173&#xD;
&#xD;
reigns, could not be containedin her&#xD;
pocket; so from her reticule she had&#xD;
transferred the money, first placing it&#xD;
all in a bag, to the drawer of a bureau&#xD;
near the bed;, this- drawer she. care-&#xD;
fully locked, and placed the key in&#xD;
her pocket.&#xD;
Hester Seated herself at ,a table&#xD;
which stood between her and the fire,&#xD;
which was burning -steadily, though&#xD;
not brightly ; on her left was, the bed;&#xD;
where Julie now placidly slumbered:;&#xD;
and near her, so that her outstretched&#xD;
hand could touch it, stood the bureau.&#xD;
The window of the room overlooked&#xD;
the garden;- it had no shutters, but- a&#xD;
thick curtain was drawn across it.&#xD;
The gardener and his wife slept, in&#xD;
the apartment behind, which was divid-&#xD;
ed from the one we have been describ-&#xD;
ing by a narrow passage.&#xD;
It was about half-past eleven; the&#xD;
night was calm, and all without was&#xD;
silent, except that occasionally a slight&#xD;
gust blew against -the front -of the&#xD;
house, causing the rose-trees to wave,&#xD;
and the climbing honeysuckle to make,&#xD;
a flapping noise as it brushed against&#xD;
the pane, The moon was nearly at&#xD;
her full, but diffused a very uncertain&#xD;
light through the patches of dark&#xD;
clouds which overspread the sky.&#xD;
Hester -had a volume open before&#xD;
her,. but her anxious look, and her&#xD;
glances, so frequently cast towards&#xD;
the bureau containing her treasure,&#xD;
betrayed that she was ill able to read.&#xD;
Then her eyes would wander to the&#xD;
window, back to the fire, and at last&#xD;
fix themselves on the placid face of&#xD;
her sister.  Now that the -newly-dis,4&#xD;
covered  relationship  endeared  the.&#xD;
slumberer to her, the mild disposition&#xD;
of Julie, her trustfulness, her simpli-&#xD;
city, and her intense love, were as so&#xD;
many ties that bound her to her heart.&#xD;
By the feeble rays of the half-shaded&#xD;
candle, Hester might have been seen&#xD;
approaching on tiptoe, and- bending&#xD;
over the-couch. Like an infant;-Julie&#xD;
lay there in sweet unconsciousness;&#xD;
Hester kissed her cheek, and then re-&#xD;
tired to her seat  Hush=I what sound&#xD;
did she hear?-it seemed like.a rustling&#xD;
among the shrubs of the garden, ac-&#xD;
companied by a light-step: mechani-&#xD;
cally, she went to thee bureau, and&#xD;
ascertained that the keyswas safe in her&#xD;
pocket ; then,; advancing to the win-&#xD;
dow, she moved the curtain a little&#xD;
on one side; everything was still with-&#xD;

out the private drawers, and turned&#xD;
over the papers, but no money was&#xD;
there. He softly felt Hester's pocket&#xD;
with his left hand, still holding in his&#xD;
right the bludgeon above her; which&#xD;
action plainly intimated that he should&#xD;
not scruple to stun- her, in case she&#xD;
awoke prematurely. No roll of notes,&#xD;
no sovereigns, were about her person;,&#xD;
of this he felt satisfied. Gazing from&#xD;
object to object, the bureau quickly&#xD;
attracted his attention. Ife tried the&#xD;
drawers, but those which remained un-=&#xD;
locked, he cared nothing about, for&#xD;
thieves are well aware that property is&#xD;
seldom deposited in open drawers. Ha !&#xD;
he found one that was fast; now, no&#xD;
doubt,, the prize 'was near. He dared&#xD;
notwaste time in searching for the real&#xD;
key, but plucked from  his pocket a&#xD;
bundle of keys, called skeleton, and&#xD;
which were of all sizes.&#xD;
On the first trial he made a slight&#xD;
noise, and the drawer would not open.&#xD;
That grating sound had no effect on the&#xD;
deep sleep of Julie, but it caused Hes-&#xD;
ter to move in her chair. The man,&#xD;
perceiving the last circumstance, in-&#xD;
stantly stepped up on tiptoe behind her.&#xD;
His leaded staff was raised above her&#xD;
head, and we shudder to think what&#xD;
Hester's fate might have been, had she&#xD;
chanced that instant to awake! But,&#xD;
after a few words feebly murmured in&#xD;
her dream, she remained quiet as be-&#xD;
fore, her forehead resting on her arms,.&#xD;
which were crossed on the table. 'The&#xD;
man in the mask again plied the keys.&#xD;
His perseverance was at length re-&#xD;
warded with success, for the drawer&#xD;
was opened.   Oh, how   eagerly he&#xD;
peered into it!  His band clutched&#xD;
something-it was a bag; this bag con-&#xD;
tained a soft substance, which proved&#xD;
to be a roll of bank notes; that-slight&#xD;
jingle-his practised ear could never&#xD;
be mistaken-it was the chink of sove-&#xD;
reigns!&#xD;
The treasure-the precious treasure,&#xD;
thus fell into the possession of the&#xD;
miscreant, and no one-was there to&#xD;
arrest his flight ; excited by his-success,&#xD;
and trembling with joy, he retreated to&#xD;
the window, and, as he passed by Hes-&#xD;
ter, extinguished her candle, leaving&#xD;
the room  in total darkness.  Then,&#xD;
creeping through the opened window,&#xD;
and closing the sash after him, he hur-&#xD;
ried out of the garden.&#xD;

HESTER S MONEY HAS VANIsHED--THE'&#xD;
POLIoE-oFoICE.&#xD;
IT was notlong before Hester awoke,&#xD;
and her first-sensation was surprise at&#xD;
finding herself in the dark. She struck&#xD;
alight; and that surprise was increased&#xD;
when she perceived that her candle had&#xD;
not burnt down, but that some person&#xD;
had placed the extinguisher upon it.&#xD;
Julie was awakened by the movements&#xD;
of her sister, and had begunto dress&#xD;
herself in order to take herturn as sen-&#xD;
tinel. A slight scream from Hester be-&#xD;
trayed that she had now discovered the&#xD;
fatal truth. The drawer of the bureau&#xD;
was open, and empty,; the treasure--&#xD;
the hoarded hope of a father's freedom&#xD;
-all the money was gone!&#xD;
Pitiable was the picture of consterna-&#xD;
tion, anguish, and despair, which the&#xD;
girl' presented. For the first' few mo-&#xD;
ments she was speechless, and, could&#xD;
only bygestures make Julie aware of&#xD;
the terrible-stroke which had befallen&#xD;
them. By degrees, however, she gained&#xD;
self-possession, and was enabled, amidst&#xD;
the whirl of her feelings, to act and&#xD;
think. She rushed to the door, but no&#xD;
one -could have entered by that way,&#xD;
since it was looked on the inside. The&#xD;
window, with its cut pane, quickly told&#xD;
the tale-; and as she threw open the&#xD;
sash, the ladder of ropes was ,seen still&#xD;
dangling from the iron bar, the thief,&#xD;
in his hurry; having neglected to take&#xD;
it away.&#xD;
Hester's first suspicion fell on the&#xD;
gardener, but the old man seemed the&#xD;
very personification of honesty; and&#xD;
when she saw his little dog, that at one&#xD;
time had roused her by his bark, lying&#xD;
dead in the garden, the idea was in-&#xD;
stantly dismissed. -But Julie now awoke&#xD;
the inmates of the house, andi all was&#xD;
excitement and-consternation.  The&#xD;
gardener hurried through the fields,&#xD;
and down the lane ; but, as- might be&#xD;
expected, nothing could be seen'or&#xD;
learnt of the housebreaker.&#xD;
Morning -dawned.    Unfortunately&#xD;
their-neighbor, Mr. Kellerman, was ab-&#xD;
sent -from home, and, ,therefore,no ad-&#xD;
vice or assistance-could beobtained&#xD;
from that quarter. Julie proposed go-&#xD;
ing to-the Fleet Prison without delay;&#xD;
but Hester, even-now kindly consider-&#xD;
ate, overruled her sister.  She was well&#xD;
assured that the poor prisoner, their&#xD;

HESTER SOMERSE.T.&#xD;

&#xD;
father, could render them no aid, and&#xD;
anxious was she to spare him the know-&#xD;
ledge of the bitter stroke, so long as any&#xD;
hope of recovering-the stolen property&#xD;
existed. One mode of proceeding offer-,&#xD;
e4itself, and the most rational one it&#xD;
seemed to be-it was to apply to a ma-&#xD;
gistrate, in order that- efficient steps&#xD;
might be taken for the discovery and&#xD;
apprehension ofthe robber.&#xD;
The master of the house in which&#xD;
they lived accompanied the sisters to&#xD;
the police-oflce, and they arrived at&#xD;
Bow-street before the magistrate had&#xD;
taken, his, accustomed place. Sad it&#xD;
was, under such circumstances, to be&#xD;
obliged to wait; but rules of office are&#xD;
stubborn things-iron, that refuses to&#xD;
bend: a magistrate will not sit before&#xD;
his time._&#xD;
The court opened at last, and some&#xD;
uninteresting  business having  been&#xD;
gone through, Hester was permitted to&#xD;
make her statement,&#xD;
Even in her distress, there was an&#xD;
air of superiority about the ruined gen-&#xD;
tleman's ; daughter which . conianded&#xD;
respect. The ushers, clerks, and mat-&#xD;
ter-of-fact functionaries of such a place&#xD;
are not readily charmed, yet the beauty&#xD;
and grace of Hester had an evidentef-&#xD;
fect upon them. -.She, detailed, in a&#xD;
plain and straightforward manner, the&#xD;
circumstances of the robbery. The ma-&#xD;
gistrate-not the one who had harshly&#xD;
treated, her on a former occasion--ap-&#xD;
peared to take great interest in her case, -&#xD;
the mare especially when he learnt for&#xD;
what object the money had been accu-&#xD;
mulated.&#xD;
"But, my dear young lady," he said,&#xD;
"had you takes, the trouble to inquire&#xD;
respecting the bankers you name, you&#xD;
would have found they are among the&#xD;
richest in London. The letter, raising&#xD;
an alarm as to their stability, was evi-&#xD;
dently written by a party connected&#xD;
with therobbery. But Ican feel for&#xD;
you; timidity, and suspicion are not&#xD;
always readily conquered,; the money&#xD;
was designed for a purpose so import-&#xD;
ant, that, by a;dutiful daughter, like&#xD;
yourself, it must have-been valued al-&#xD;
m4st like life itself. ut,.no doubt, you&#xD;
are impatient; you are anxious:for; a&#xD;
way to be pointed out whereby the lost&#xD;
property may be recovered: We will&#xD;
do kwhatwe can, and if our efforts prove&#xD;
vain, I shall.very sincerely pity you.&#xD;
In the first place, have youpreserved&#xD;
nimlier~s and dates of the notes?"&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hester produced the list of which we&#xD;
have spoken, and it was passed to the&#xD;
magistrate.&#xD;
"Bless me, all fives and tens, andone:.&#xD;
hundred sovereigns! Tlgis is valuable&#xD;
booty; the villain will pass the small&#xD;
notes easily in the country, and the&#xD;
stoppage of them at the Bank of Eng-&#xD;
land will, I fear, be of little use."&#xD;
The countenance of Hester assumed&#xD;
an expression-of anguish which a paint-&#xD;
er might have depicted, though words&#xD;
may not describe. But two police-con-&#xD;
stables now stepped forward, and one&#xD;
of them addressed the magistrate-.&#xD;
"Please your worship, Bateman and&#xD;
I think we can throw some light on this&#xD;
business, if your worship gives us leave&#xD;
now to speak."&#xD;
"Speak on," said the magistrate.&#xD;
"Last night, or rather this morning,&#xD;
for 'twas near four o'clock, I found a&#xD;
man lying across the pavement in Pic-&#xD;
cadilly; he seemed to be in a fit, so I&#xD;
raised him off the stones, and called&#xD;
assistance, when Bateman came up.&#xD;
Searching his pockets. to find out -his&#xD;
address, that we might carry him home,&#xD;
we discovered a bunch of skeleton-keys,&#xD;
a small crowbar, and other housebreak-&#xD;
ing implements; then, from another&#xD;
pocket, we drew forth a heavy bag-it&#xD;
was full of money!"-&#xD;
Hester uttered afaint cry at the bare&#xD;
possibility that. this might prove her,&#xD;
lost treasure.&#xD;
"A bag of money," said the magis-&#xD;
trate; "go-on."&#xD;
"We carried the man to a surgeon's,&#xD;
who said the fit was a bad one, and&#xD;
brought on, he thought, by over-excite-&#xD;
ment of mind. I put a seal upon the&#xD;
bag, and gave it to the inspector; and&#xD;
he, your worship, has the money now.&#xD;
in court."&#xD;
"Very well; let the inspector pro-&#xD;
duce it. If .the sum is composed of&#xD;
bank-notes, the numbers of which cor-&#xD;
respondwith those marked on the sheet&#xD;
before me, of course the matter is de-&#xD;
cided. that the property is the young&#xD;
lady's."&#xD;
the inspector of police came forward,&#xD;
and at once placed the bag of money on&#xD;
the table. OhI to have seen Hester's&#xD;
glistening eyes, her clasped hands, and&#xD;
to have heard her exclamations of rap-&#xD;
tare, might have touched the hardest,&#xD;
and warmed the'coldest heart..&#xD;
"-That is mine!-ours?-J-I know it-&#xD;
thank Heaven! I am happy now!"&#xD;
&#xD;
i[&#xD;
&#xD;
self at last, .His hypocrisy would&#xD;
avail him nothing now; his hardihood&#xD;
could not face out the. terrible andpal-&#xD;
pable truth: the wretched man knew&#xD;
it, and felt it.&#xD;
Ay, he felt it, and therefore he&#xD;
shrank into himself; - therefore his&#xD;
lean and withered limbs trembled, and&#xD;
his teeth chattered. In a word, his&#xD;
moral and physical courage had fled.&#xD;
A-miserable object, he appeared, of&#xD;
fraud unmasked, and long-flourishing&#xD;
iniquity receiving retribution at last.&#xD;
He answered no word to the questions&#xD;
of the-magistrate ; in sullen silence he&#xD;
was, removed from the police-ofice, and&#xD;
in sullen silence locked up. - On the&#xD;
following day, he was placed again at&#xD;
the bar, and examined ; the depositions&#xD;
were taken against him, and no doubt&#xD;
of his guilt being entertained, Mr. Pike&#xD;
was fully committed to take his trial&#xD;
for housebreaking and robbery.&#xD;
&#xD;
And, overwhelmed by the - feelings of&#xD;
the moment, and scarcely conscious of&#xD;
what she did, Hester ardently embrac-&#xD;
ed her sister, while tears filled her eyes.&#xD;
Meantime, the moneywas turned out&#xD;
upon the table, and the magistrate's&#xD;
clerk began to count the sovereigns.&#xD;
They proved to be a hundred. JThe&#xD;
notes were enrolled, and their dates-and&#xD;
numbers exactly agreed with Hester's&#xD;
account.&#xD;
"Well," said -the good magistrate,&#xD;
taking off his spectacles, with a happy&#xD;
and beaming look, "this is, indeed, a&#xD;
fortunate affair; and I congratulate the&#xD;
young lady most sincerely on the prompt&#xD;
and unexpected recovery of her lost pro-&#xD;
perty. But," he asked, "where is the&#xD;
criminal? Did he recover from the fit?"&#xD;
"Yes, your worship," replied the in-&#xD;
spector; "he is now quite well: we&#xD;
have him here-locked up."&#xD;
"Then bring him before the bench,"&#xD;
said the magistrate.&#xD;
There was a movement among the&#xD;
people, and a turning of heads in the&#xD;
direction that the prisoner was expected&#xD;
to 'come. Already. the- housebreaker&#xD;
seemed to be an object of morbid inte-&#xD;
rest, and each one asked the other if it&#xD;
was known who he was., But the pri-&#xD;
soner now appeared, and was led for-&#xD;
ward by the constables, and placed in&#xD;
the dock. Then an -involuntary ex-&#xD;
clamation of wonder burst from the lips&#xD;
rof many present, to whom the person&#xD;
of the unhappy man was well known.&#xD;
"It is Mr. Pike !--Mr. Pike, the at-&#xD;
torney !--.impossible !" were the-words-&#xD;
echoed around.,&#xD;
Hester and Julie, too, were taken by&#xD;
surprise ; for they had not conceived&#xD;
that their.~ father's persecutor , and&#xD;
Hartley's tool would have proceeded&#xD;
to such a length-committing at once&#xD;
an act of the lowest, vilest description,,&#xD;
and yet of consummate daring. And&#xD;
how  did Mr. Pike comport himself,&#xD;
with the eyes - of all fixed upon him,&#xD;
and his guilt revealed so completely&#xD;
that no loophole was,: left him for&#xD;
escape..&#xD;
There ha stood, the black, relentless&#xD;
persecutor of the innocent, the ,pan-&#xD;
derer to the evil passions of an. un-&#xD;
natural brother-; his 'career having&#xD;
been pursued for years, long years-&#xD;
his one object the amassing of money.&#xD;
There he stood, the plotting, the cau-&#xD;
tious, the crafty; .spreading snares for&#xD;
others, but caught in the snare him-&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. PIKE IN NEwGATE.&#xD;
THE money was safe, and the heart&#xD;
of Hester was full of.happiness, .yet&#xD;
she did not exult over a fallen enemy.&#xD;
That enemy was now in a ,prison-mi&#xD;
Newgate-awaiting his trial.    -&#xD;
From the serious nature of the crime&#xD;
with which he was-charged, and other&#xD;
considerations, Mr. Pike was not lodged&#xD;
,in one of the common wards, where it&#xD;
'has been the custom to place. three,&#xD;
six, and sometimes even twelve pri-&#xD;
soners together.. He was confined in&#xD;
a separate cell, with liberty to take air&#xD;
and exercise in the yard twice a day.&#xD;
The cell was not altogether cheerless,&#xD;
light being admitted through a grating&#xD;
about eight feet from  the ground,&#xD;
There was a little iron bedstead, with&#xD;
a Straw mattress;:in the corner; he&#xD;
was allowed a wooden chair, with a&#xD;
small; deal table, and, enjoying the&#xD;
privileges of prisoners before-con-&#xD;
viction, writing materials were .,sup-&#xD;
plied him.&#xD;
That he deeply felt his degradation,&#xD;
may be supposed. He,-the respectable&#xD;
gentleman-the upholder, :by profes-&#xD;
sion, of the laws of his country-the&#xD;
flourishing fundholder--to be confined&#xD;
in Newgate jail! the fact was enough&#xD;

dared to touch one penny of that money&#xD;

amount somewhere in the ground.&#xD;

soothe my spirit-I know it would.&#xD;
But, alas 1 these are idle dreams. I&#xD;
shall-lose my money. I am undone,&#xD;

With an air of abandonment he flung&#xD;
himself into his chair. His lean body&#xD;
was bent double as he rocked himself:&#xD;
to and fro; and in his agony the miser-&#xD;
wept.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
MR. PIKE IS VISITED IN PRISON BY HIS&#xD;
OLD PATRON.&#xD;
THE door of the cell was opened, and&#xD;
one of the jailers of the prison entered.&#xD;
"Here's your counsel come to see&#xD;
you, Mr. Pike," said the man. "This&#xD;
is the first time, I believe," he added,&#xD;
addressing the stranger. "How long&#xD;
do you want, sir?"&#xD;
"A half an hour, perhaps, will be&#xD;
sufficient."&#xD;
The jailer retired,- closing the door&#xD;
after him. : In no othet capacity than&#xD;
that of legal adviser would Mr. Hartley&#xD;
have been allowed this - private inter-&#xD;
view with Pike; but since the former&#xD;
was known to be a barrister, however&#xD;
little he practised, the liberty had been&#xD;
4very easily obtained. Hartley now stood&#xD;
&#xD;
179&#xD;
&#xD;
before the.prisoner, but remained for&#xD;
several minutes without speaking, and&#xD;
all that Pike did was to raise his-eyes&#xD;
imploringly, and fix them on him who&#xD;
had been so long his employer and&#xD;
patron.&#xD;
"You are come to do something for&#xD;
me-come to save me," said the attor-&#xD;
ney.&#xD;
"You are past that," observed Hart-&#xD;
ley; "I will not buoy you up--there is&#xD;
no hope for you."&#xD;
Mr. Pike groaned.&#xD;
"'I thought your last game was to be&#xD;
.your best-it has proved 'your worst,&#xD;
for , you have disappointed me, and&#xD;
ruined yourself."&#xD;
"Don't upbraid me; the calamity no&#xD;
human foresight could guard against.&#xD;
I had succeeded in my enterprise, as&#xD;
you know, when that bodily ailment&#xD;
struck me down. I lost my senses be-&#xD;
fore I had time to dispose of the money,&#xD;
or throw away the implements I had&#xD;
used. The fit passed, and I found my-&#xD;
self in custody, discovered-ruimed!&#xD;
Mr. Hartley, I have sold myself for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Not at all; you have been liberally&#xD;
rewarded for everythingyou have done.&#xD;
Pike, I believe we"understand each&#xD;
other.  I well know, if you imnagineit&#xD;
may benefit yourself, you will not scru-&#xD;
plc to be tray me."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Hartley  said Pike, look-&#xD;
ing obliquely at him, "iou have been&#xD;
my master, as it were, my abettor, my&#xD;
inciter, through all the business, and I&#xD;
have 'thought that, were I-to tell this to&#xD;
the jury, it might go far to soften the&#xD;
rigor of the punishment which might&#xD;
be awarded me."&#xD;
"Miserable man!" exclaimed Hart-&#xD;
ley ; "but I expected this of you. It is&#xD;
not enough that the'power I once pos-&#xD;
sessed over the fortunes of my enemy&#xD;
has passed from my hands, but the vile&#xD;
tool I used is turned into a dagger to&#xD;
stab me."&#xD;
"Ay," said Pike, with a grin of ma-&#xD;
licious pleasure; "and-I can tell them&#xD;
of something more. I don't see whyI&#xD;
should be transported, and you escape.&#xD;
I'll tell them that Flemining, the hunch-&#xD;
back, met-"&#xD;
I."Liar! and -slanderer!" interrupted&#xD;
Hartley.&#xD;
" Thy victims lie in a pauper's gravel"&#xD;
said Pike.&#xD;
"Do you'wish to die yourself? Hush!&#xD;

"Strive,:then, to save me.&#xD;
"I cannot do it; but this I will do, d&#xD;
and to make the proposal I came here p&#xD;
to-day. You will be found guilty ; there n&#xD;
is no help for that-transported, per-It&#xD;
haps,-for fourteen years.; Whatever&#xD;
money you possess, as a matter of i&#xD;
course, must be forfeited."&#xD;
"Ha!" cried Pike, clenching his,&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
" Listen to me-accuse me not-men- x&#xD;
tion not my name in connection withs&#xD;
your, own, and  I swear that, on your&#xD;
return, all you have lost shall be made I&#xD;
good to you from my private prperty." I&#xD;
Mr. Pike mused, his long chin resting&#xD;
on his hand, and his eyes fixed on the t&#xD;
'wall of his cell. He shook his head, and"&#xD;
counted on his fingers: at length he&#xD;
spoke without lookingat Hartley.,&#xD;
"It won't do-fourteen years-a long&#xD;
thne it is to one who is growing old;I&#xD;
besides, the sentence may be for life,&#xD;
and of what use then will your money&#xD;
be ? On the other hand,iflI=pove to&#xD;
the jury that you have set me on, that&#xD;
you are the principal, and I only the&#xD;
agent, I calculate it will make a great&#xD;
difference as regards the severity of my&#xD;
sentence-perhaps I may get off with,&#xD;
"seven years. It won't do, I say-I&#xD;
can't listen to you.",&#xD;
"Be reasonable; think again; mine&#xD;
is the best plan."'&#xD;
"No," said Pike, firmly;."you shall'&#xD;
not get off. The truth is, I think I shall&#xD;
be transported for life, unless you are&#xD;
shown to be my prompter and abettor:&#xD;
I can't help accusing you-I must do&#xD;
it; so that's settled."&#xD;
Hartley was acquainted with the cha-&#xD;
racter of the man so well that he - de-&#xD;
spaired of moving him; and. he knew&#xD;
Pike would not lift his little finger to&#xD;
save the life of a-fellow-being, if nothing&#xD;
personally was to be got by the action.&#xD;
e flt in his heart the truth of the-&#xD;
other's reasoning, and believed, under,&#xD;
any:circunstances, that Pike, would&#xD;
tra sported for life;}consequently, the&#xD;
promise of miakingover to him property.&#xD;
on his .presumed return would, hoW-&#xD;
ever urged, possess no weight in influ-&#xD;
encing his conduct. In a word,.Hart-&#xD;
ley was now assured that Pike-would&#xD;
betray their connectiona.ud bring him&#xD;
to shame.&#xD;
An idea crossed his mind.: might it&#xD;
not be possible to remove the evidence,&#xD;
&#xD;
nd silence the man's tongue forever,&#xD;
or he had that concealed about him&#xD;
which would enable him to effect the&#xD;
eed? What then?-should he aim&#xD;
prove his position? no; for pn ignom'&#xD;
ious death on the gallows would be&#xD;
he inevitable consequence.&#xD;
On all sides he saw himself hemmed&#xD;
i: here, certain accusation; there, if&#xD;
he sought to prevent that accusation, a&#xD;
doom of shame; while the gratification&#xD;
he had received from carrying out his&#xD;
revengeful projects was at an end,&#xD;
and the triumphant countenance of his,&#xD;
enemy rose like a mocking vision upon&#xD;
his waking dreams. Half his life had&#xD;
been wasted in the morbid indulgence&#xD;
of oneb.dark and demoniacal passion---&#xD;
the offspring of an unhappy, disap-&#xD;
pointed love. He had fed, as it were,&#xD;
on the poison of revenge: the pains,&#xD;
trials, and sorrows of his enemy had'&#xD;
formed the only. source of happiness&#xD;
he had known, and, with fostering&#xD;
care, he had; spread his persecutions&#xD;
over a wide space of years. -His heart&#xD;
was now not the seat of remorse, but,&#xD;
of cankering wretchedness-of gloom&#xD;
deeper than that of a Cain-of a wear.&#xD;
ness, a loathing of mankind and the&#xD;
world, which words may not describe.&#xD;
Anger or excitement was no longer&#xD;
betrayed by, Hartley: his manner&#xD;
settled into a deep imperturbable calm;&#xD;
and, he now addressed the man who&#xD;
had been his tool and accomplice.&#xD;
" Hear me; you will be banished to&#xD;
a distant land; you will be made to&#xD;
work in chains; every farthing of your&#xD;
property is lost forever. You will be&#xD;
a wretched being-a blot on the earth&#xD;
-a loathed thing of shame, for men to&#xD;
wag their heads at. Will you escape&#xD;
all this?-I know a way.".&#xD;
Mr. Pike sprang up breathlessly,&#xD;
hope and joy beaming in his counte-&#xD;
nance.&#xD;
"A' way ? Then tell me; dear Mr.-&#xD;
Hartley; show me the way, and I will&#xD;
not accuse you-I will bless you V'&#xD;
" There is a passage in :one of the&#xD;
Greek writers which-teaches-'when the&#xD;
ills of life counterbalance the good,when&#xD;
misery is stronger.than happiness, then&#xD;
it is the part of.wisdom-:to die!'"&#xD;
" To die?" repeated Pike, staring on&#xD;
Hartley-"to die? I don't understand&#xD;
you. That's not the way you mean,&#xD;
is it?"&#xD;
"Yes; are you reluctant to leave a&#xD;
world which has no moi-e good to offer?'?&#xD;
&#xD;
181&#xD;
&#xD;
"Rather," said Pike, turning pale;&#xD;
' I think I would rather not leave it--&#xD;
at least not just yet."&#xD;
"Do you fear to sleep in the earth&#xD;
instead of in your bed ?"&#xD;
"Don't talk so, dear Mr. Hartley-&#xD;
I don't like to hear you talk like this.&#xD;
I tell you, I would rather not die-a&#xD;
great deal rather not. Sleep in the&#xD;
earth?-'tis horrible to think of."&#xD;
"This is the only method, then, I&#xD;
can recommend, if you wish to escape&#xD;
the evils which surround you."&#xD;
" Thank you; I would rather be&#xD;
excused following your advice," an-&#xD;
swered Mr. Pike. "Under any 'cir-&#xD;
cumstances, I am resolved to live."&#xD;
"Poor coward " said Hartley, mus-&#xD;
ingly; "governed by the instinct that&#xD;
governs the unreasoning brute-cling-&#xD;
ing to life fe life's:sake. Pitiable man,&#xD;
live and be wretched! I envy thee not.&#xD;
Betray me--say what thou wilt-it&#xD;
will be the, same to me now."&#xD;
Hartley turned away, and searched;&#xD;
for something~ beneath his vest. He&#xD;
again approached Pike, and the latter&#xD;
perceived. that he held in his hand a&#xD;
small pistol. The attorney, who only,&#xD;
thought-'of himself, started back in,&#xD;
terror.&#xD;
"What ? you don't mean to murder&#xD;
me, Mr. Hartley? In pity, forbear!&#xD;
think of the consequences to yourself.&#xD;
I don't wish to die, I say-I will live.&#xD;
-I rnust live!"&#xD;
"Fear not, timorous idiot! live, for&#xD;
I can wish thee no deeper curse than&#xD;
the life thou dost cling to. Here," he&#xD;
said, looking at the pistol, and speak-&#xD;
ing to himself rather than his com-'&#xD;
panion,-" this little thing will give me&#xD;
all I now covet-oblivion and peace,&#xD;
It will solve the grand secret. It will&#xD;
send me, perhaps, tojoin company with&#xD;
Cato, Brutus, and all who, to escape&#xD;
defeat and the ills of life, dared to cut&#xD;
the thread. of their own destiny, rather&#xD;
than to-wait patiently for the dividing,&#xD;
shears of the dark  sters. Welcome&#xD;
-welcome the future, whatever it be!"s&#xD;
:Mr. Pike, paralyzed by terror, re-&#xD;
main ed in the corner of the cell. He;&#xD;
could not call the jailer-he could not&#xD;
utter a word; his "limbs shook, his&#xD;
teeth chattered, and his eyes were,&#xD;
riveted '-on Hartley.  But he  who&#xD;
meditated suicide appeared suddenly&#xD;
to alter his determination, and return-&#xD;
ed the pistol to his pocket, muttering'&#xD;
to - himself, "Not here-not here; 1&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;

THE FAREWELL TO THE FLEET PRISON-&#xD;
THE, LAST VIsit TO BETHLEHEM HOS-&#xD;
PITAL.&#xD;
EvIL as Hartley was, and though he&#xD;
had followed hie brother, during so&#xD;
many years, with bitter; relentless&#xD;
persecution, that brother mournedhi s&#xD;
untimely end. ,But it was' feeling of&#xD;
terror and awe, rather than of sorrow,&#xD;
which oppressed Hester and Julie, when&#xD;
they heard of thetragic occurrence.&#xD;
Ere the scene described in our last&#xD;
chapter took place, the bill of -&#xD;
change held by Hartley had been paid,&#xD;
andlthe day was now come when the&#xD;
prison doors were to be opened to the&#xD;
captive.  Ten years had   Somerset&#xD;
languished within those walls, but free-.&#xD;

&#xD;
would not be carried forth from  a&#xD;
prison." One silent, contemptuous&#xD;
look he cast at the unhappy attorney,&#xD;
and moved to the door of the cell; he&#xD;
passed out, and Pike, much to his&#xD;
relief and satisfaction, found himself&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
That evening, when all was calm and&#xD;
quiet in the Temple, and the lawyers.&#xD;
had closed their offices-when the dews&#xD;
were lightly falling on the -shrubs and&#xD;
flowers in the Temple Gardens, and&#xD;
the first stars were shedding down their&#xD;
silver threads of light on the old hall,&#xD;
.the p saying fountain, and the church&#xD;
where the dust of centuries is laid=-&#xD;
the report of a pistol was heard. It&#xD;
proceeded from chambers in the King's&#xD;
Bench-*alk. and a porter, hastening&#xD;
up the stairs, found Hartley on the&#xD;
floor. The ball had entered a vital&#xD;
part, but, as the porter raised the bleed-&#xD;
ing -man, he still breathed.&#xD;
" Tell people I committed this act-&#xD;
pshawl you need not fetch a surgeon;&#xD;
it is of- no use. Somerset-" he'&#xD;
gasped, endeavoring to raise his hand,&#xD;
"my enemy--it is your turn to triumph&#xD;
now; so moves round the wheel'of&#xD;
inevitable fate!"&#xD;
lIe sank back-; his fierce and malig&#xD;
nant eye grew diim; and the unhappy&#xD;
Hartley-the mnan whose nature disapa&#xD;
'pointed love had changed almost into&#xD;
a demon's-the brooding recluse-the&#xD;
'incarnation of a revengeful spirit-ha&amp;amp;&#xD;
ceased to breathe.&#xD;

&#xD;
once; it was a lovely spot, the fine old&#xD;
house-"&#xD;
"And the oak drawing-room, the&#xD;
terraces, the gardens," said Mr. Somer-&#xD;
set, assisting her, "the quiet lawn, and&#xD;
the clumps of trees-"-&#xD;
" Yes, yes; but how should you know&#xD;
this, sir?"-&#xD;
" The-infant that was carried away,&#xD;
and the fruitless search for it in Lon-&#xD;
don."&#xD;
"Oh, yes, I remember all; that time&#xD;
comes back to me now like a dream&#xD;
long forgotten. - What have I been&#xD;
doing all these years?"A&#xD;
Mr. Somerset made a sign to Julie,&#xD;
who drew close to her mother.&#xD;
" Isabella! that infant had a peculiar&#xD;
inark on the arm; here, look here; say,&#xD;
will not this prove what we have&#xD;
stated?"&#xD;
Mrs. Somerset stooped, and, looking&#xD;
at Julie's arm attentively, seemed lost&#xD;
in thought. The web. of reason was&#xD;
evidently disentangling itself-one idea,&#xD;
prompted another; trifles sometimes&#xD;
are impressed on the brain, when the,&#xD;
recollection of great events is oblite-&#xD;
rated,-and smallincidents will bring&#xD;
about what years of training and dis-&#xD;
cipline may have failed to accomplish.&#xD;
The poor woman took Julie's hand;&#xD;
she also seized Mr. Somerset's, while&#xD;
Hester stood close behind them. She&#xD;
looked, bewildered, from one to- the&#xD;
other, as if some light, for the first&#xD;
time was pouring in upon her soul.&#xD;
" What does this mean?" she cried,&#xD;
in a breathless accent. "You tell me&#xD;
this is Hester's sister; I am assured of-&#xD;
it now-she is my lost child! A veil&#xD;
seems-to be drawn back, and scales to-&#xD;
fall from:my eyes. The whirling and&#xD;
ringing have ceased in my brain, and,&#xD;
1, appear to be a new being, full of new&#xD;
thoughts, feelings, and energy. My&#xD;
child, my little one!- you shall share-&#xD;
my heart with Hester; and you shall&#xD;
both comfort your wretched - no!&#xD;
wretched no longer-you shall, both be&#xD;
a delight to your restored-and happy&#xD;
mother.. Ah, blind that I was," she&#xD;
continaed,:turning to Mr. Somerset-.&#xD;
"blind that I was'; but I see you-I&#xD;
know you now. - Hugh, High, -my&#xD;
husbandI1"&#xD;
And the wife rushed into the open-&#xD;
arms of him who felt a rapture beyond&#xD;
the power of words.to express -&#xD;
"She is weeping," said the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
"This is the first time I have seen her&#xD;
in tears. No sign could be better."&#xD;
And weeping, sobbing, she remained,&#xD;
nor did they strive to check that soft-&#xD;
ened and tender grief. It was human,&#xD;
and betrayed that the functions of the&#xD;
mind and the fount of feeling had&#xD;
awakened from their torpid state. Yes,&#xD;
memory had' first been roused, and its&#xD;
beautiful mechanism, as it were,' being&#xD;
readjusted, imparted life and action to&#xD;
the reasoning powers: the godlike soul&#xD;
again claimed her sway, and Mrs. So-&#xD;
merset's intellectual faculties, by a pro-&#xD;
cess simple as effective, werecomplete-&#xD;
ly restored. The next day she left the&#xD;
walls of Bethlehem Hospital, never to&#xD;
enter them again.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
RESTER AND THE~TEoPESSoR or MUSIC-&#xD;
WE TAKE oURF AREWELL OF R. PIKE.&#xD;
Mn. SOMERSET, we have elsewhere&#xD;
observed, had 'felt very reluctant 'for&#xD;
his daughter to appear before a public,&#xD;
audience, even as a singer at concerts;&#xD;
but, fortunately, Mr. Kellerman's repre-&#xD;
sentations, and Hester's earnest wishes&#xD;
in connection with her great object, had-&#xD;
borne down his scruples. What was&#xD;
she now to do? continue the career ,say&#xD;
successfully begun? Her own feelings&#xD;
were as much adverse- as the feelings,&#xD;
of her father to a line of lfe that una-&#xD;
voidably placed her-in a public position.&#xD;
Yet her engagement with the musical&#xD;
professor could not be broken. Mr.&#xD;
ellerman's good faith, the pains he&#xD;
had taken with her as a pupil, and his&#xD;
unvarying kindness, were also claims:&#xD;
upon her no less strong than those of&#xD;
honor. Hester, then, was to sing an-&#xD;
other season under the name previous-&#xD;
ly assumed, the professor, as agreed,&#xD;
receiving half her gains.&#xD;
The duty was entered on; but more'&#xD;
and more the sensitive and, retiring&#xD;
nature of Hester turned- with aversion&#xD;
from apublic exhibition of her talents.&#xD;
Happy, indeed, was she when her last&#xD;
piece was sung, and-her last instalment&#xD;
of money placed'into the Mands of Mr.'&#xD;
Kellenrman. I taking leafe of that&#xD;
gentleman, she- expressed, herself in-&#xD;
terms of the warmest gratitude; Mr.&#xD;
-Somerset equalled his daughter in the&#xD;
fervor with which he acknowledged his&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
obligations, and hoped, so long as h&#xD;
lived, that he should be honored by th&#xD;
acquaintance of one who had prove&#xD;
himself to be his true friend and bene&#xD;
factor.&#xD;
Meantime, the trial of Mr. Pike hat:&#xD;
come on at the-Old Bailey; but in spite&#xD;
of all his talented pleading--for he de&#xD;
fended his own cause-in spite-of hi&#xD;
innocent and demure looks, and the&#xD;
grievous wrongs which the deceased&#xD;
Hartley and other evil men, in shori&#xD;
the combined world, had showered&#xD;
upon his head, he, Mr.: Pike, the inof-&#xD;
fensive old man, whose only aim had&#xD;
been-" and surely, gentlemen of the&#xD;
jury," he said, "it can't be called a&#xD;
crime"-whose only aint had been to&#xD;
make a comfortable provision for his&#xD;
decliningyears-this excellent old man,&#xD;
we say, was found guilty of common&#xD;
housebreaking and an atrocious robbery.&#xD;
The judge passed sentence on the de-&#xD;
fender of English laws, the once&#xD;
respectable fundholder, and the man&#xD;
who had been such an active member&#xD;
of the Fraud-Preventing Society; that&#xD;
sentence was - "Transportation be-&#xD;
yond the seas for the term of his natu-&#xD;
ral life!"&#xD;
Mr. Pike did not bear his fate with&#xD;
the equanimity and fortitude which&#xD;
might have been expected from a man&#xD;
of his education, and one who had been&#xD;
engaged in so many undertakings of&#xD;
spirit and.daring  He shed tears one&#xD;
minute, and shook his fiats at the judge&#xD;
and jury the next. But it was of no&#xD;
avail; his sorrow and his ferocious in-&#xD;
dignation were alike useless. They&#xD;
took him out of the court, and barred&#xD;
the respectable old gentleman in his&#xD;
cell; they took him away to the hulks,&#xD;
and in due time transferred him to the&#xD;
convict-ship. There they chained him'&#xD;
to another felon, who proved to be the&#xD;
man of Greyhound-alley, whom    he&#xD;
once served with a letter, threatening&#xD;
prosecution for his. maltreatment of&#xD;
the costermonger's donkey. So the&#xD;
ruffian was to be his companion, and&#xD;
now, resolving to be revenged, swore&#xD;
and grinned at him, and mocked the&#xD;
sorrows of the fallen attorney. He&#xD;
asked Mr. Pike what had become, of&#xD;
his office, and his papers tied with red&#xD;
tape, and all the poor lawyer could&#xD;
return in reply was to call him a foul&#xD;
insulting demon; he asked the ex-fund-&#xD;
holder what had become of his proper-&#xD;
.ty--and all the hard-working, penuri-&#xD;
&#xD;
185&#xD;
&#xD;
ous gentleman could do was to gnash&#xD;
his teeth, and howl out curses on his&#xD;
tormentor and those who had robbed&#xD;
him. So, while in this situation, one&#xD;
fine morning the vessel weighed anchor,&#xD;
and our old friend and companion-he&#xD;
who has accompanied us through so&#xD;
many scenes of this history-set out on&#xD;
his pleasant voyage to the far-off land&#xD;
of Botany Bay.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
UNFORGOTTEN LOVE-THE coNFESSIoN.&#xD;
TEN years' imprisonment had unfit-&#xD;
ted Mr. Somerset for any active duties ;&#xD;
though his health was pretty good, his&#xD;
frame had become enfeebled. He was,&#xD;
however, cheerful, and the restoration&#xD;
of his wife to the full enjoyment of heir&#xD;
faculties was a source to him of su-&#xD;
preme happiness. . Still, it appeared&#xD;
that on Hester devolved the task of&#xD;
supporting her parents; Julie, who&#xD;
had obtained a situation, uld do little&#xD;
more than provide for h rself. Hester&#xD;
commenced teaching     sic in private&#xD;
families, and having no  nger any ene-&#xD;
mies to contend with, her  ils steadi-&#xD;
ly increased. Such a life   'ght be&#xD;
laborious, but she greatly prefe edthe&#xD;
duties it imposed to any other ode of&#xD;
livelihood it had been her fate at dif-&#xD;
ferent times to follow.&#xD;
Yet, not unfrequently, a sadness&#xD;
came over the spirit of the ruined gentle-'&#xD;
man's daughter, and which neither her'&#xD;
parents nor Julie were able to account&#xD;
for. The great object for which she had&#xD;
labored was obtained; the plans that&#xD;
hitherto had put her faculties on the&#xD;
stretch wereunneeded now; theturmoil,&#xD;
thefears, the bitter disappointments and&#xD;
sorrows, all were over.  Why, -then,&#xD;
was she not happy? ,In the 'absence&#xD;
of excitement, the spirit had time to&#xD;
think, and the past rose before her.&#xD;
There was an image impressed on her&#xD;
heart. Like the characters traced irm&#xD;
sympathetic ink, though they may re-&#xD;
main for years invisible, yet, place&#xD;
them before the fire, bow the lines&#xD;
spring into sight, as if by the spell of a&#xD;
magician! So the image on the heart&#xD;
of Hester, never obliterated, though&#xD;
none knew of its existence, was. now&#xD;
called forth in vivid colors by.quiet&#xD;
and contemplation. It waste image&#xD;

of one with whom her early dreams&#xD;
and young affections were entwined-&#xD;
the image of one she strove to forget,&#xD;
but could not-the image of one loved&#xD;
in girlhood's days, when scarcely she&#xD;
knew what love meant, and whose&#xD;
memory still, through tie mist of years,&#xD;
shone like a star. Talk not of the fick-&#xD;
leness of woman, nor say the love of&#xD;
her childhood will never survive the&#xD;
joyous spring-time of life; marvel ra-&#xD;
ther at her constancy, and confessthat&#xD;
love, then formed, is the blossom of the&#xD;
heart-a blossom which In time pro-&#xD;
duces the full and perfect fruit.&#xD;
"Father, again you ask me why I am&#xD;
unhappy. I will conceal nothing from&#xD;
you; I will confess my folly-for- such&#xD;
it is. -Bear with me; do not condemn&#xD;
me, although I may deserve reproof."&#xD;
"Reproof! never, my child--my bene-&#xD;
factor-never shall you receive reproof&#xD;
from me."&#xD;
As Mr. Somerset sat in his chair,&#xD;
Hester leant forwards, and rested her&#xD;
head on his arm. Oh how he loved&#xD;
her The idolatry of his affection might&#xD;
even be a sin, but the blot of such a&#xD;
sin the "recording angel" would surely&#xD;
wipe out with the tears of mercy and&#xD;
pity.&#xD;
"Do you think he is still alive?"&#xD;
asked the girl, looking up.&#xD;
"Who alive, Hester? I do not knovt&#xD;
what person you mean."&#xD;
"Ah! how could I suppose you&#xD;
should? So many years have passed,&#xD;
and I have not even mentioned to.you&#xD;
his name. I thought, too, at one time,&#xD;
I had forgotten him ; but I was mis-&#xD;
taken.  Well, father, you remember,&#xD;
long ago, when we lived at Brookland&#xD;
Hall-"&#xD;
Ashade overspread the countenance&#xD;
of Mr. Somerset; he turned in his chair&#xD;
and sighed. Brookland Hall, the seat&#xD;
of his ancestors, but long in the posses-&#xD;
sion -of strangers-what thoughts of&#xD;
happy hours, and pursuits of former,&#xD;
days, did the name call up in the breast&#xD;
of the ruinedman!--the oldElizabethan&#xD;
pile, the venerable rooms and family&#xD;
paintings, the slopes, the gardens,-the&#xD;
trees, and sweeping park-:-the picture&#xD;
rose before his fancy in all the fresh-&#xD;
ness of reality. But not for him-&#xD;
never again for him-must the scene&#xD;
spread its beauties; his eyes must close&#xD;
far away, and he must not even sleep&#xD;
in the old church where his forefathers&#xD;
for centuries have reposed..  --&#xD;
&#xD;
HESTER SOMERSET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Somerset stooped his head, and&#xD;
covered his face with his hands:- '&#xD;
"Go on, Hester," he said, after a&#xD;
pause. "What of Brookland Hall?"&#xD;
"You remember one of your tenants&#xD;
called Banks? He had a son, placed&#xD;
by you in the village school."&#xD;
"I recollect perfectly. Yes, I think&#xD;
too much and too often of Brookland&#xD;
Hall for any incident of old times to-&#xD;
escape my memory.    Banks--Lewis&#xD;
Banks, that was the lad's name-a bold&#xD;
little fellow, who called once at the&#xD;
hall, begging to be sent to school-a&#xD;
lad of most precocious intellect, smitten&#xD;
with the love of military life, forgetting&#xD;
to drive the oxen 'afield,' or hoe pota-&#xD;
toes, in his ardor to read Vauban on&#xD;
'Fortification' and the battles of Marl-&#xD;
borough. You see my memory is good,&#xD;
Hester."&#xD;
"I rejoice at it, father.  But you&#xD;
sent him away afterwards, and dared&#xD;
him to trespass upon your grounds."&#xD;
"So: I did, poor youth; yet was I&#xD;
sorry in being compelled to do it.&#xD;
Bless me! I had almost forgotten that&#xD;
little circumstance. He took it into&#xD;
his head to love you, I believe, child.&#xD;
At that time I considered such a thing&#xD;
daring and presumptuous on his part;&#xD;
and, of course, situated as we then&#xD;
were, I was justified in my sentiments.&#xD;
But, Hester, why do we allude to all&#xD;
this now? What have the fortunes of&#xD;
a peasant's son to do with ours?"&#xD;
"He went to aforeign land. He wrote&#xD;
me several letters ; but when Brookland&#xD;
.Hall was taken from us, none of his&#xD;
letters, if any more arrived, reached me&#xD;
in London.- So perhaps he is dead, or&#xD;
has-has forgotten me."--  -&#xD;
A low sob burst from Hester; and&#xD;
when Mr. Somerset raised his child&#xD;
from her stooping posture, he saw that&#xD;
her face was bathed with tears. Then&#xD;
he knew her secret; then he understood&#xD;
the cause of her melancholy--a love&#xD;
that was ill placed and without hope.&#xD;
" Do not yield to this -distress. I-&#xD;
will not, I cannot reprimand you,"&#xD;
said the old man tenderly. "Yet little;&#xD;
did  I imagine these   recollections&#xD;
and early feelings would be cherished&#xD;
by you during so many years. Bit&#xD;
whether such constancy be a weak-&#xD;
ness or a virtue, your peace of mind&#xD;
and your welfare in life demand that&#xD;
you should make efforts to conquer an&#xD;
attachment which, in any case, can&#xD;
bring you no-happiness. Most proba-&#xD;
&#xD;
bly-I feel it my duty to speak plainly&#xD;
-the young man is dead. If he be&#xD;
alive, good conduct or cleverness may&#xD;
have advanced him to the rank of' a&#xD;
corporal or a sergeant; but with such&#xD;
a person, you are aware, no female&#xD;
much above a menial servant could&#xD;
form an alliance. Therefore, I repeat,&#xD;
consult your mind and your judgment'&#xD;
in this matter rather than your heart.&#xD;
Renounce feelings that can only be a&#xD;
source of disquiet, and forget that such&#xD;
a person as this poor youth ever ex-&#xD;
isted."&#xD;
" I will strive, father ; but your ad-&#xD;
vice will be difficult-very difficult--&#xD;
to follow. One thing let me say ; the&#xD;
mind of Lewis Banks was not the&#xD;
mind of an ordinary person ; it was&#xD;
noble by nature. And I will believe&#xD;
But it is enough. Let us speak&#xD;
no more of a subject which crushes&#xD;
my spirit, while it" gives you pain.&#xD;
Father," said Hester, after a pause, "I&#xD;
have a favor to ask of you.",&#xD;
"A favor ? What would I not grant&#xD;
or do for you, my child ?"&#xD;
"I have long wished-my mother&#xD;
and Julie, too, are very desirous-we&#xD;
have long wished to godown to Nor-&#xD;
folk, just to see the place where we&#xD;
passed so many years-to look once&#xD;
more on the well-known spots, and the&#xD;
old house---"&#xD;
" What? go to Brookland Hall ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Somerset, who turned pale,&#xD;
while his lip quivered-" the house-&#xD;
that was once mine, but- is now ano-&#xD;
ther's-the place so dear to my heart&#xD;
that scarcely a night has passed for&#xD;
twelve years without my dreaming of&#xD;
it?  Oh, no!" he cried, waving his&#xD;
hand ; " I could not bear the trial--I&#xD;
could not support the sight !"&#xD;
" Now  you are mistaken, father.&#xD;
You would be soothed and gratified ; I&#xD;
feel confident of it. And perhaps the&#xD;
present owner is a kind' man, and&#xD;
might allow us to look over the rooms.&#xD;
Let us pay a visit to Brookland Hall."&#xD;
Mr. Somerset remained for a con-&#xD;
siderable time without speaking. At&#xD;
length he raised his head.&#xD;
" Well, Hester, I confess that, while&#xD;
I have shrunk at the thought, I have&#xD;
sometimes longed to see that spot&#xD;
again. -There is a strange fascinating&#xD;
interest about the home of my ances-&#xD;
tors which attracts me to it. I will&#xD;
see the old hall again, and the sweet&#xD;
village, and the venerable iviedahurch,&#xD;
&#xD;
187&#xD;
&#xD;
before I die. Yes, we will go down to&#xD;
Norfolk."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
IN WHICH OUR HISTORY DRAWS TO A&#xD;
CONCLUSION.&#xD;
IT was a beautiful afternoon in&#xD;
spring when Mr. Somerset, his- wife,&#xD;
and two daughters, alighted from the&#xD;
stage-coach near the village of - , in&#xD;
Norfolk. They stood upon the slope&#xD;
of the well-known hill, contemplating&#xD;
in silence the scene before them.&#xD;
Lovely and picturesque, as in former&#xD;
days, spread the verdant landscape.&#xD;
The warm sun, shining obliquely from&#xD;
the west, tinged with yellow light the&#xD;
tops of the tall elms that rose around&#xD;
the old Norman church, and threw its&#xD;
lustre on the stream which wandered&#xD;
away in the direction of Brookland&#xD;
Hall. The clear song of the black-&#xD;
bird was heard from the thicket, and&#xD;
the low of cattle came softly from the&#xD;
opposite hill.&#xD;
The little party walked into the vil-&#xD;
lage.- Every step they took awoke&#xD;
some old remembrance, except in the&#xD;
breast of Julie ; yet she, having been&#xD;
born in the neighborhood, could not&#xD;
consider herself a stranger ; faces,&#xD;
however, were altered ; the merry&#xD;
young children that had gambolled&#xD;
under the trees had grown into sturdy&#xD;
peasants, and the old slept in the vii.&#xD;
lage churchyard.&#xD;
They entered the cottage where Mr.&#xD;
Somerset's tenant, honest Banks, had&#xD;
lived; he and his wife were no more,&#xD;
and the sexton occupied the hovel.&#xD;
Mr. Somerset differed so greatly in&#xD;
appearance from the jovial and. rosy&#xD;
squire of a former day, that a recog-&#xD;
nition seemed improbable; even Hes-&#xD;
ter and her mother might not have&#xD;
been remembered, but they took the&#xD;
precaution to draw their veils closely&#xD;
around their faces.&#xD;
The sexton was verycomplaisant, con-&#xD;
sidering himself honored by this visit&#xD;
from strangers. "You seem tired,&#xD;
sir," he said. " And will the ladies be&#xD;
pleased to rest themselves on this set-&#xD;
tle? 'tisarough and poor seat, I confess.&#xD;
Any business, sir ?"&#xD;
"No," answered Mr. Somerset, en-&#xD;

An extraordinary expression broke&#xD;
over the countenance of the soldier, as&#xD;
if, while he witnessed the old man's&#xD;
emotion, a sudden light had flashed&#xD;
upon him.&#xD;
"lBe not offended," he said, taking&#xD;
the poor gentleman by the hand, " but&#xD;
I am no longer to be deceived. Thank&#xD;
Heaven, my search is finished at last I&#xD;
This packet is for yourself; for, honor--&#xD;

" What does this mean ? ~How should&#xD;

Why, these are the title-deeds of the&#xD;
Brookland estates, and-and--  You&#xD;
mock me, Colonel Gordon."&#xD;
But as the open-hearted soldier re-&#xD;
garded him with moistened eyes, Hes-&#xD;
ter, who had retired to the window-&#xD;
recess, was heard to sob violently, and&#xD;
the next minute, overcome by her con-&#xD;
flicting feelings, she .sprang towards&#xD;
her parent.&#xD;
"Father! father ! look at him!--do'&#xD;
you not know your generous friend ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Somerset," said Colonel&#xD;
Gordon, "you see before you the once&#xD;
poor ploughboy, that, many years ago,&#xD;
you kindly consented to place=in-the,&#xD;
village-school."&#xD;
know it-I see it now !" cried&#xD;
the ol man. "Brave, noble-hearted&#xD;
Lewis Banks ! Heaven, then, has&#xD;

"Not more, I hope, than Heaven&#xD;
will from this hour smile on you, my&#xD;
dear sir; for surely Providence means&#xD;
well in having thus, when we little ex-&#xD;
pected it, brought us together again."&#xD;
And now came explanations of past&#xD;
events, pressings of the title-deeds on&#xD;
Mr. Somerset, and, at last, their ac-&#xD;
ceptance : then followed allusions to&#xD;
early affection on the part of Colonel&#xD;
Gordon, showing how, times without&#xD;
number, he had written to England,&#xD;
his letters, from a good cause, having&#xD;
failed to reach their destination; while&#xD;
Hester, wishing to spare him pain, had&#xD;
never, informed him of the ruin which&#xD;
had overtaken the family.&#xD;
This conversation at length came to&#xD;
a close. Mr. and Mrs. Somerset, with&#xD;
Julie, walked into the room beyond,&#xD;
examining the paintings there; but&#xD;
Hester, gently objecting though not&#xD;
unwilling, for some unaccountable-rea-&#xD;
son fund herself detained by Colonel&#xD;
Gordon ; she tqlso heard him, in low,&#xD;

&#xD;
tremulous accents, urge many things&#xD;
about first and only love, and con-&#xD;
stancy never shaken; so that, quite&#xD;
unexpectedly, and, as it were, unknown&#xD;
to- herself, her eyes filled with tears,&#xD;
and her trembling hand was clasped in&#xD;
his.&#xD;
When Mr. Somerset returned to the&#xD;
room, he soon perceived- how matters&#xD;
stood, and the colonel begging to speak&#xD;
privately with him, the old gentleman,&#xD;
then and there, without hesitation, con-&#xD;
sented to give his daughter to one she-&#xD;
had loved as a peasant boy, and who&#xD;
had proved himself to be as generous&#xD;
and noble as he was endowed with&#xD;
abilities and genius-genius which,&#xD;
triumphing over-all obstacles, had&#xD;
raised him to the rank he now enjoyed.&#xD;
The good father pronounced his bless-&#xD;
ing upon them ; and it were difficult&#xD;
to say which heart of the respective&#xD;
persons who made up that pleasing&#xD;
group overflowed with the most intense&#xD;
happiness.&#xD;
On the following day, when it was&#xD;
known in the village and among the&#xD;
surrounding peasantry, that the good&#xD;
squire and his family had returned to&#xD;
them once more, old and young, linked&#xD;
together, walked up to the manor-&#xD;
house to welcome them back; and for&#xD;
days afterwards there was nothing but&#xD;
feasting and ringing of bells.&#xD;
What has the.chronicler now to add,&#xD;
ere he writes "end" to his history? It&#xD;
is this*while the once bitter-souled&#xD;

Abercrombie, the swindling director of&#xD;

with his wife and daughter Julie. From&#xD;
the park they could see a neat cottage&#xD;
standing at the foot of a green knoll;&#xD;
there lived Reuben 'and his wife; and&#xD;
Mr. Somerset had given the-m a plot of&#xD;
ground for a.garden; the ex-turnkey of&#xD;
