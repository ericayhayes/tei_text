&#xD;
they had simply fallen upon a topic that always 'proved in-&#xD;
harmonious. George Coleman's essay for that day reflected&#xD;
a little adversely tpon the better half of creation: Amy&#xD;
'Denbrook was angry about it: sh~had diligently 'studied&#xD;
the history of Napoleon, that she might have his defects at&#xD;
her command, when George lauded him: she was in love&#xD;
with every imbecile king or prince who gave. het' opportunity&#xD;
td say, "I suppose you think such an oAne more worthy of&#xD;
his~position than his wife."&#xD;
She expressed' herself with an exceeding latitude and&#xD;
asperity, which was partially the result of having lived but&#xD;
sixteenn years, and partially from a desire to make her posi-.&#xD;
tion strong. Whenever she had been able to silence George&#xD;
into sudden thoughtfulness, she felt as if lifted upon wings,&#xD;
but as she kept on her way home that. October day, she was&#xD;
seIzed with an aching sense of failure in her whole being: she&#xD;
was not niaking the most of herself: she was not usino' the&#xD;
divine subtlety bestowed upon woman to help George :2-this&#xD;
came to her vaguely in the shape of repentance and yearn&#xD;
ing; \it came to be effaced by a thousand mdods, by a world&#xD;
of childish and selfish fancies, but the yearning and repent.&#xD;
ance struck root that day, as some tree Abegins its .lif~ in the&#xD;
soil without much seeming cause: perhaps this stirring in&#xD;
the tangled garden of 1~er soul, l~ ad taken place before'&#xD;
,she remembered it because it was a preludeto a higher kind&#xD;
of life; it was an episode in a fa ~eful day. Sh~ reached&#xD;
home, and before entering the hous4, noticed the soft, strong&#xD;
wind that swayed among the elm 4 in slow niowment, and&#xD;
&#xD;
/'&#xD;
&#xD;
then lifted up and around the heavy mass of cedar&#xD;
foliage: the door yard was slightly strewed with brilliant&#xD;
red and yellow leaves: a thin gray vapor moved from the&#xD;
north-east over an upper sea of dimmed silver: the long,&#xD;
muslin curtain of her chamber window had loosened itself&#xD;
from its rude bracket, and floated outward: the vine which&#xD;
was twined thickLy about the porch moved from stem to&#xD;
topmost leaf: the grain-tields~~ waved, the wooded hills&#xD;
breathed in unison, and the breeze coming freshly from Long&#xD;
Island Sound, swept through the open door and out into the&#xD;
vegetable garden with a pleasant murmur. She ascended&#xD;
noiselessly to her chamber, and sat down by the open win-&#xD;
dow: the restless wave of the eternally grecn cedars dis-&#xD;
quieted her: for the first time they seemed to suggest rest-&#xD;
less endeavor: the hastening sky rolled dull shadows over&#xD;
the water: so het' hasty words someti\~ies rolled shadows&#xD;
into the sea of family life, and even beyond it, as they had&#xD;
done to-dayb That very morning her invalid father had&#xD;
said to her, handing her his overcoat, "I wish, my dear, you&#xD;
would mend this: I f~el pretty comfortable today, and will&#xD;
try to walk a few' rods."&#xD;
She had answered, "0, papa, I am right in the 'midst of&#xD;
my lesson. Can't you wear it this once as it is ~"&#xD;
"Yes !" he had replied  1 gently with a look that now smote&#xD;
her more than it had d ne at the time: she sti'ove to still&#xD;
the remorseful 'throbbi g within her, that she might go&#xD;
down to him, and strolfe his hair, and say with unwanted&#xD;

love, "Are you still better, father dear? Where is the&#xD;
oVercoat? I am just in the mood fur mending it now&#xD;
Brushing away a few drops, she looked down the roai to&#xD;
a graceful gateway among the treetops, which indicated a&#xD;
curve toward the beach: even thence there seemed to float~&#xD;
the low sigh with which her father had resumed his ~hair:&#xD;
after his fruitless request to her1: she felt that it was her&#xD;
careless lack of tenderness which occasioned it: when first&#xD;
he was sick, she was so eager to do him sohie little service,&#xD;
but he had been ill so long, and had seemed to grow no&#xD;
worse, so that she was used to it all.&#xD;
"Ab, that I might be newly created, and cast i~fto dis-&#xD;
tanc9 my old self !' she murmured, still looking toward&#xD;
the archway against the clouded heavens, as if it strength-&#xD;
ened her: her spirit, like her eyes, sought a mysterious&#xD;
something beyond he.i' ken: she laid her face on the ~vindow-&#xD;
sill and prayed, and when she lifted it, there was an earnest,&#xD;
tender outlook upon it; she felt that she should sometime&#xD;
meet a~ tide of peace as she travelled on.&#xD;
"I will ask George's pardon for my rudeness," sh&amp;amp;&#xD;
thought, "I will be tender, tender, tender to my father."&#xD;
She went down stairs, and looked out of the back door&#xD;
into th~ garden as she passed: her younger sister Isabel sat&#xD;
swinging under the butternut tree, and nodded her heed air-&#xD;
ily and condescendingly to her; she went intQ her mother's&#xD;
bedroom, and found her quietly sleeping; every day she took&#xD;
a nap, because her rest was much disturbed at night by Mr.&#xD;
Denb.rook's cough.&#xD;

"What a pretty pThk color, mother has in her cheeks !"&#xD;
thought Amy, looking at her with a daughter's exaggerated&#xD;
admiration; she did not think how much fairer she was her-&#xD;
self: she was not wholly beautiful, yet her hazel eyes were&#xD;
bright and dewy with good thoughts; her lips were red with&#xD;
the tide; there was a suggestion of innocence about the&#xD;
white temple, from which the chestnut hair was gathered&#xD;
back in waves; the lines of her face were soft, scarcely&#xD;
representing the abrupt depth of her passions: of these she&#xD;
knew little herself except that she often became angry, and&#xD;
often repented. She wished she were obedient by nature as&#xD;
Isabel seemed. to be: she looked out of th&amp;amp;win~ow; there&#xD;
the child sat and swung, touching her foot to a stone every&#xD;
other moment to give impetus to her motion. She sang&#xD;
"Old Dog Tray !"&#xD;
"1kw childish she is for a girl of thirteen !" mused Amy,&#xD;
not knowing that it was as well to be a. child as long as possi-&#xD;
ble: she noticed that the curls of her golden-brown hair&#xD;
were gathered into a dignified twist at the back ~of her head,&#xD;
which circumstance probably accounted for the airy style of&#xD;
her recognition a moment before. Bel had forgotten her.&#xD;
hair now; for her white chin was a little elevated as she&#xD;
watched the scudding clouds, and trilled and quavered softly&#xD;
through the air she was singing with a comical pathos.&#xD;
Amy entered the sitting-room, and went to her father's&#xD;
arm-chair, the back of which was toward her. "Are you&#xD;
watching those sloops, father ?" she asked, drawing the wifl~&#xD;
dow-shade a little higher. "One two, thrue, four, five yes-&#xD;

sels, I see ~" She turned and 'laid her hand upon his, which&#xD;
rested upon the arm of his chair: her eyes simultaneously&#xD;
fell i~pon his face. She struck her hand ~ipon her heart,&#xD;
with a stifled, " oh !" and sank upon the floor in a kneeling&#xD;
posture, her eyes startlingly turned to the open door of her&#xD;
mother's bed-room. Mrs. Denbrook sprang up from h~'&#xD;
~'ecIining position, and cried,&#xD;
~'What?" with frightened eyes and accent.&#xD;
"He's gone !"&#xD;
"No!"&#xD;
And the wife was at his side': she saw that he was dead,&#xD;
and her right hand, which had been unconsciously uplifted&#xD;
as she crossed the room, fell with a gesture of despair; she&#xD;
shook violenti~r, and held to his chair a moment, then she&#xD;
sat down, and after wiping the cold brow, laid her white&#xD;
face upon his breast without any tears: he had told her that&#xD;
he would be apt to die thus.&#xD;
Amy rose and looked in the ghastly face: there seemed a&#xD;
heavenly shining iR the half-closc'd eyes. "Mother, is he&#xD;
gone ?" she breathed, touching her shoulder.&#xD;
Her mother lifted her face, and uttered "Forever I" in a&#xD;
strange tone of anguish and triumph.&#xD;
Then rolled with a stunned bewilderment through Amy's&#xD;
brain, the great flood of self-reprc~ach and love.'&#xD;
"Gone !" slL0 said, as she staggered from the room.&#xD;
"Gone /77 she repeated, as she mounted the 'stairs with a&#xD;
swaying wiotion, holding by the banisters. "Gone !" she&#xD;
gasped with a cry, as she closed her door,' and dropped upon.&#xD;

the carpet prostrate. "Aye, forever! I can never reach&#xD;
after him until I die, ana tell him I said; I would be tender,&#xD;
tender, tender to him,"&#xD;
Nearly an hour went by, filled with startled shocks, for&#xD;
the gate opened frequently, and each, time the click seemed&#xD;
so sudden and terrible, Amy could scarcely restrain her&#xD;
shrieks. Isabel's hand shook her door, and her voice called,&#xD;
"Amy, Amy, let me in !"&#xD;
The girl had half unconsciously turned the button, of her&#xD;
door, when she fled up stairs to be alone with her remorse:&#xD;
she admitted IsaI~el silently, and the two dropped down by&#xD;
the bed and laid th~ir faces upon it: Bel shuddered, clutched&#xD;
her sister's hand, and whispered, "Do you hear the rain? it&#xD;
began to get dark down stairs !"&#xD;
"Where's mother, Bel ?" at this instant the door was&#xD;
softly rapped upon, and then pushed open. George Cole.&#xD;
man's mother entered; she was a pale, gentle woman, yet&#xD;
there were certain indications of character about her mouth:&#xD;
she saw deep excitement in the countenances of the children,&#xD;
and a solemn trouble in their eyes as they regarded her&#xD;
questioningly. She bathed Amy's forehead as she talked&#xD;
'wfth her about some household details, then she said,&#xD;
"Your mother is very frail; child; she will require all your&#xD;
courage !"&#xD;
Amy abruptly pushed away the hand 'that was bathing&#xD;
her forehead, while a crimson flood surged over her face.&#xD;
"Do you mean," she uttered with difficulty, "that my&#xD;
mother is sick ?"&#xD;

"I mean that she is very much worn out with the care of&#xD;
your father." Mrs. Coleman did not reflect that the death&#xD;
of a loved ohe fills the heart with a superstitious dread lest&#xD;
another may be snatched aWay: this feeling now trembled&#xD;
at Amy's heart, but she arose with a self-controlled expres-&#xD;
sion, laid 13e1's hand in Mrs. Cok man's, and left them: she&#xD;
wanted to see her mother alone, and she passed uncon-&#xD;
sciously among the kind neighbors h1 the hall, seeking her&#xD;
in her chamber. Mrs. Deubrook sat by the window: the&#xD;
exceeding paleness of an hour before had gone, and instead,&#xD;
there was that pretty pink color.&#xD;
"hectic !" thrilled through Amy's spirit. She wa~s going&#xD;
to say, "Mother, I will attend to everything !" but instead&#xD;
of that, she sank at her feet, and buried her face in her lap:&#xD;
she was going t&amp;amp; comfort her~ and she saw a singular splen~&#xD;
dor in her mother's face.&#xD;
"Amy, it is ILig morning.! he has reached the break of&#xD;
day !" Amy looked up into the heavenly countenance, and&#xD;
her mother went on: "I am surprised to feel that his ph-&#xD;
tient heart will never again be strained Ito lift a burden: a&#xD;
strange, deep fountain of assurance is reached in my soul.&#xD;
All is well--aye, all is amazIng. My child, you and I may&#xD;
looked into    eyes: she took her face in&#xD;
take new courage: our      g draws near also-I see it in&#xD;
the distance. My dear !" she softly pushed back her daugh-&#xD;
F ter's hair, and&#xD;
her two palms. "He has jus~t now entered another world:&#xD;

Amy put her hand over her eyes, and sobhed,4 "0&#xD;
mother !" then passionately caught her beloved hands and&#xD;
laid them on her forehead with a deluge of tears.&#xD;
"He talked to me last night, Amy. I did not believe&#xD;
his death was so near, but there was a seraphic calmness&#xD;
about him-such hole, such expectation: all that he said&#xD;
and looked, has overspread me ever since 'likea cloud for&#xD;
a covering.' The future seems so near: the days so filled&#xD;
with room to work for it."&#xD;
"I am so young, mother, the great future is not near to&#xD;
me. I must be religious some day, but if I could only&#xD;
mount a material Jacob's ladder step by step every day,&#xD;
instead of this hard, hard work of holding fast to that&#xD;
which is good: oh! that bodily fatigue could satisfy the&#xD;
Lord! oh! that I could travel to some shrine to be a Christ-&#xD;
ian. I pray sometimes !-once in a great while I pray&#xD;
spontaneously, aside from my regular morning and evening&#xD;
devotions: but, mother, I scarcely ever attend family pray-&#xD;
ers with real pleasure: there is rarely anything in me that&#xD;
craves them. I want to push away religion often, and yet&#xD;
oh! I feel that I must have it! Talk to me! talk to me P&#xD;
"Your father talked about you and Isabel last night 1"&#xD;
"V/hat did he say ?"&#xD;
"He said he pitied you most~ because you would have to&#xD;
acquire an equable temper and the sort of religious rever-&#xD;
ence that belongs naturally to isabel-but he believed you&#xD;
would conquer, and would ere long rivet your eyes upon&#xD;
the Morning Star."&#xD;

fully, serenely. "Then, dear mother, he will not be pained&#xD;
about-about my conduct, where he is, if he believes I will&#xD;
try to do better."&#xD;
"Tie said, 'I shall leave them with perfect trust behind&#xD;
me, for I know that their destiny requires just such discip-&#xD;
line as they will have: entreat them to look up as they&#xD;
journey along.' Jie had suffered incredibly in mind for&#xD;
many monthss, knowing that our little substance was wast-&#xD;
ing, but that feeling has of late beer~ utterly taken from&#xD;
him.'&#xD;
"Are we poor, mother? haven't we enough to live on&#xD;
"We are very poor, my child !" answered her mother,&#xD;
and a shadow fell on her face.&#xD;
"Well, I don't seem to mind that: we never were rich."&#xD;
The sense of property was not very keen in Amy unless&#xD;
some dear association was connected with an object: nor&#xD;
did she naturally appreciate care: her mother was one of&#xD;
those rare spiritual souls within whom pressure de~~elopes&#xD;
a spring of strength: whet~ the Father's hand touched her&#xD;
most nearly, sh~ saw his glorious plans the best: it had not&#xD;
always been so: she had striven much.&#xD;
Isabel came in softly: her blue unquiet eyes sought her&#xD;
mother, and an expression of relief passed into her face as&#xD;
she noticed her outstretched arms: she sat in her lap, and&#xD;
laid her head upon her shoulder: Arny~s head rested upon&#xD;
Bel's knee. And thus long hours passed away, while the&#xD;
&#xD;
16&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
mother's lips seemed touched with inspiration: she was for&#xD;
the time lifted above herself-she felt that she was soon to&#xD;
cross the bridge and change worlds: the vitality of her&#xD;
inward life rose supreme, and sublimated her maternal love&#xD;
~o that its whole strength condensed into a desire to prepare&#xD;
her orphans for the journey that lay before them: her pity&#xD;
for them took a higher aspect: as Christ changed the, water&#xD;
into wine, so evei}y throb of her soul was alehemised into&#xD;
'something vigorous ere it passed to them. Mr. Denbrook&#xD;
had been a scientific man, an unrequited inventor, but~ the&#xD;
bitterness of his lot became salutary in the highest sense:&#xD;
so he felt towards the last : he had bent over fiery furnaces&#xD;
with sweat pouring from his brow: he had worked late at&#xD;
night in his dark, grim shop: he had strained endurance to&#xD;
complete a delicate design, and when he f~Wed of means, he&#xD;
sold his invention and his knowledge for a trifle to keep the&#xD;
wolf~ from his door: he never entered the palace that his&#xD;
genius first made possible to its owner. Yet perhaps he&#xD;
was a successful man: his trial in the workshop of the&#xD;
world doubtless wrought for him ~a palace in the upper&#xD;
kingdom: thus he came to think, and every honest struggle&#xD;
in God's name came to ~eem to him like a pearl ordiamond&#xD;
in his crown of life. So he went Qut of the door of this&#xD;
world with a smile in his heart, and he knew that his child-~&#xD;
m'en must toil for far-off palaces as he had done.&#xD;

CHAPTER 11.&#xD;

Two years after, Amy Denbrook stood before a looking-glass&#xD;
*                                         0&#xD;
in a third story front room the windowss opined upon a&#xD;
S~poor, retired street in New York. Isabel w4s tying her&#xD;
shoe, for it was six o'clock in the morning. A dead silence&#xD;
prevailed, for Del was reckoning ~ip in her unmatbernatical&#xD;
br'un just how much money she had earned during the few&#xD;
months she had been book-folding in the same establishment&#xD;
~vith Amy. After an ineffectual attempt to be a seamstress&#xD;
in her native village, Amy had followed the advice of Mrs.&#xD;
Coleman who had removed to Ne~v York, and had gone there&#xD;
~ to commence life as a book-folder: a small stun of money&#xD;
~ had been realized from the sale of books and various articles,&#xD;
of furniture: this amount, together with Ainy's industry had&#xD;
~ supported the two girls. Isabel had attended a public&#xD;
school until recently, and now her added IThor made the&#xD;
~little parlor and bedroom which she called hon-ic, quite beau-&#xD;
~iful with new embellishments. To be sure, the floor was&#xD;
~vered with the carpet she had seen from her childhood:&#xD;
t~ie old mahogany spfi~. stood against the wall, so did the&#xD;
&#xD;
?&#xD;
&#xD;
ancient table and chairs, but the window-sills were gay with&#xD;
plants: dainty temples of moss and shells adorned the man-&#xD;
tel, and above it hung in an oval gilt frame, the face of a fair&#xD;
child; this had been a Christmas gift from George Coleman&#xD;
to Amy just under it stood a delicate white vase of ancient&#xD;
design and tracery this was George's gift to Del, and many&#xD;
were, her efforts to keep it filled with something fresh and&#xD;
green. The orphans ha&amp;amp; wept many tears during the first&#xD;
year of their lonely estate, but youth is recuperative, and&#xD;
they might be called happy girls nuw: very often they be-&#xD;
came tired of their work, but a return to their beloved par-&#xD;
lor' was always a holiday. They lived as simply as if they&#xD;
had been European peasants: how indeed could they afford to&#xD;
live otherwise? Would it not spoil their room to cook&#xD;
much in it? Was not cold water friore healthy than tea&#xD;
ahd coffee? and was it not lucky for them that they were&#xD;
obliged to drink it, else what a trial it might have been, if&#xD;
they could have had it, and yet fdlt it a duty to resist. Not-&#xD;
withstanding these congratulations, it sometimes happened&#xD;
that on a Sunday afternoon, an old coffee-pot steamed on a&#xD;
tiny new stove in a most fragrant and suggestive manner.&#xD;
What a love of a ~tove that was! Del bought it herself; and&#xD;
sometimes stood looking at it entranc~d, particularly before&#xD;
going to church; even there she reproached herself fbr won-&#xD;
dering if pancakes could be baked on it: she hoped it was&#xD;
not wrong to get up a beautiful tea on the Sabbath, they&#xD;
had so little time to make a joy out of the stove on week-&#xD;

days: gratitude and delight must be acceptable to the Crea&#xD;
tor. George Coleman often came in Sunday afternoons to&#xD;
read essays to Amy: he was studying law in the city.&#xD;
It was of George Coleman that Amy was thinking SO in-&#xD;
tently as she stood before the absently curling' her&#xD;
hair.&#xD;
"Belt" she at length exclaimed.&#xD;
"What?" briskly inquired that young lady, holding her&#xD;
third finger in order not to lose the place in her reckoning.&#xD;
"Do you think, eh-would you like crackers and milk for&#xD;
breakfast ?"&#xD;
0,1 tfl~it                                b&#xD;
ou~ you were going to say something' else.&#xD;
Yes! suppose we do !"&#xD;
Amy fastened her collar fastidiously, then with an averted&#xD;
face said "Bel, do you think George likes me? that is, do&#xD;
you suppose he is-what any on~ would call-in love with&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"Amy Denbrook, you don't say so !" cried Bel in raptur..&#xD;
ous excitement. "I never thought of it. Isn't it roman~&#xD;
tic ?"&#xD;
"I don't know that it is !" returned Amy a little sulkily,&#xD;
for she did not enjoy Isabel's demonstrative manner upon a&#xD;
subject tha~ she had just dared to breathe into words. The&#xD;
two busie4 themselves' for an hour about their domestic&#xD;
deities, say ng very little: during this time, Bel had in&#xD;
imagination~ got George and Amy to hou~ekeeping in a inure&#xD;
pleasant street, after a charming bridal tour in which she&#xD;
&#xD;
shared: she was receiving a lover one evening whom she&#xD;
had met on this trip, when it occurred to her that it was as&#xD;
yet all a dream.&#xD;
"Amy,~~ she inquired, in a very respectful tone, "shall&#xD;
you marry him ?"&#xD;
"lie has not asked me yet," said Amy, coldly, though&#xD;
her color rose a little. "I would not have spoken of it,&#xD;
Bel, only it occurred to me a few days ago that-that he&#xD;
might care for me particularly; and if so, I shall see him&#xD;
less frequently, and you must help me."&#xD;
"Now, Amy! I've heard you say we had not a friend in&#xD;
the world that you thought so much of as George."&#xD;
"That may be! I4may not want to come under ~his yoke&#xD;
for all that! his father was a Spaniard: I have often&#xD;
thought that George inherited a certain feeling of disdain&#xD;
toward women: education has done much for him, but&#xD;
there is a well-spring in his nature that I do not fancy."&#xD;
Why, Amy!' you said not long ago that he was so&#xD;
honest and manly, and I thought his father was an English-&#xD;
man&#xD;
"No! he lived in England a dozen years: he was a poor&#xD;
man there, and he probably overlaid his chivalry with prac-&#xD;
tical ideas about the domestic usefulness of the fair sex.&#xD;
Did you notice the other day that when I was on my knees&#xD;
washing the oil-cloth, and George came in, he said, "That's&#xD;
right, Amy, I like to see you industrious!" It made me&#xD;
angry: I like industry myself; and I like elegant poverty,&#xD;

but I don't want any man to love me becan e I am an in-&#xD;
dustrious girl. It may be all right for me to work at very&#xD;
commonplace duties-I don't complain of it, but if Ihad~i&#xD;
husband, I should rather ha would sayj '1 wish I could save&#xD;
you from such humble labors: you are fitted for nobler&#xD;
work."'&#xD;
"I think no man of sense would want an indolent s~rife.&#xD;
You want George to think you an ~riel goddess 1" said Bel.&#xD;
"I'm sure I thought he was complimentary the other day:&#xD;
I hever should have been angry abbut that, especially whe~i&#xD;
he seemed so bright and joyou~ U'&#xD;
"1 suppose I was foolish, and I dare say George merc~l&#xD;
thinks of me as an old friend, otilyl wish "&#xD;
Amy did not complete the expression of her wish : she an&#xD;
Bel put on their bonnets, and went to their work. Or~ their&#xD;
way, they met George Qoleman, who bowed rather care-&#xD;
lessly, looking chiefly at Isabel: there was a reason for thiu:&#xD;
Amy had been somewhat cold and perverse on the day that&#xD;
her industry was admired. ~George was piqued by it,&#xD;
though he could not guess the causp: his indifferent manner&#xD;
restored Amy's equilibrium, and convinced her that her bus-&#xD;
picions had been very egotistical. All that was noble and&#xD;
attractive in him came to her ~fre~h, when she believed that&#xD;
he sought only her friendship: ~he was so heartily glad the.&#xD;
old footing could be retained: she felt quite xxilling now&#xD;
that George should tyrranize over her reading.&#xD;
The next morning just as she and Bel were ready to go to&#xD;
their work, George came in with his old, cheerful smile.&#xD;

'1-Jere is a book for you to read,, Amy !" he said, as he&#xD;
threw one on the table.&#xD;
"Thank you !'~ she replied, cordially; then with an ani-&#xD;
mated smile, she called his attention to a white rose that&#xD;
was inbloom.                           4&#xD;
lie nodded, as if pleased with. her ~leasnre, but he did&#xD;
not seem to care about examining the fiowe'~. "Have you&#xD;
finished this yet ?" he ~inquired, taking D'A4igne's history&#xD;
from the table.&#xD;
"No! I've been reading something else~ A most be-&#xD;
witching book !"&#xD;
What ~"&#xD;
"Ivanhoe !" she answered, bending toxyara the floor for&#xD;
a pin which she had dropped.&#xD;
"I asked you to leave that until you had finished the&#xD;
history."&#xD;
"Gui, monsieur U' *she looked up from her kneeling posi-&#xD;
tion with a particularly smiling, provoking expression in her&#xD;
eyes; he could not withstand the playful malic~ of her air,&#xD;
and responded with a smile,&#xD;
"I believe you refrained from reading the history just be-&#xD;
cause I happened to ask you n~t to let ~ny thing else inter-&#xD;
fere with it." ~&#xD;
"Was it safe to ask me if you did not wish me to run in&#xD;
an opposite direction ?"&#xD;
~He looked suddenly very grave: Amy observed it, but&#xD;
she said joyously, "Come, my little friends, take flight! I&#xD;
want to lock up the castle !"&#xD;

When they were on the street, George said, "You seem&#xD;
to be perverse just for the love of it !"&#xD;
." Yes} I enjoy it !" giving her shawl a graceful little&#xD;
shake. "You are wilful because you like it; are you&#xD;
not ?"&#xD;
"Me?"&#xD;
"Yes, you !" an~ Amy laughed with a mixture of mirth&#xD;
and satisfaction, knowing that it always nettled him to be&#xD;
supposed amenable to the same rules as herself.&#xD;
"1 arA older than you, and-"&#xD;
At. this moment they met a well looking gentleman of&#xD;
forty who lifted his hat to the young girls; they bowed&#xD;
with a pleased, respectful smile, as they said, "Gbod morn-&#xD;
ing, Mr. Second !"&#xD;
"Isn't he good to lift his hat to us, with that courtly air,&#xD;
just as if we were as rich as he ?" said Isabel.&#xD;
"Your landlord ?"' demanded George laconically.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Bel, "and ~he also~ owns the building&#xD;
where we work: the first time we ever saw~ him was when&#xD;
he came there on business: we lived where we do now for&#xD;
six months, su~5posing that the agent who collected the rent&#xD;
was the owner. Mr. Second calls himself now every month&#xD;
for it, and he always seems so friendly; he had the two&#xD;
little closets made each side Qf the fire-place in our parlor,&#xD;
without our even suggesting it, and ho told Amy she must&#xD;
not f'eel diffident about speaking of any little improvements&#xD;
we should like."&#xD;
"I didn't ask him to put up new blinds to the windows,"&#xD;
&#xD;
struck in Amy. "J had spoken to the agent about it, but;&#xD;
he paid no attention to me whatever. That is just the dif-&#xD;
f'erence between a gentleman and a clown. As soon as Mr.&#xD;
Second saw those shattered blinds, he said, "I am sorry I&#xD;
V&#xD;
did not know what a condition these were in before !"&#xD;
"Where does he live ?" asked George, "has he a large&#xD;
family?"&#xD;
"1 don't know !" responded. Amy. "It seems as if he&#xD;
must have daughters at home, because he is so fatherly and&#xD;
considerate toward us&#xD;
A few months passed away, during which George Cole-&#xD;
man alternately attracted and repelled Amy, according to&#xD;
the side of' his character which was towards her: one side&#xD;
she loved,, and it drew her heart with power into his grasp:&#xD;
theother,~ her whole passionate nature rebelled against: it&#xD;
ignited the pride that w~s rarely astir except under his&#xD;
touch. It came into her consciousness often that he intended&#xD;
to make her his wife, and under his melting smile, it seemed&#xD;
as if there was no way for her, except to glide along at his&#xD;
side in the future. When he was prosaic and exacting, she&#xD;
coiled, and showed the recoil outwardlywonly by tossing into&#xD;
the air every serious idea which he was disposed to endow her&#xD;
with: when he would fain instruct her in regard to~ the&#xD;
intricacies of a symmetrical female character, she was in-&#xD;
variably full of levity and jest :-so provokingly heedless&#xD;
and high.mninded that he could not have believed his ears,&#xD;
had he heard some of her earnest conversations on the same&#xD;
subject with Isabel. If one day there was upon her face, a&#xD;

&#xD;
sudden outlook of love and sunshine, the next time he saw&#xD;
her, he was surprised at the indifference of her manner: he&#xD;
set these change~ down to womanly caprice, not knowing&#xD;
that they were all controlled by causes which he did not&#xD;
perceive: her inconsistencies were regulated by nice laws,&#xD;
and hung upon his moods: if she had pained him, she was&#xD;
gentle afterward: if he presumed upon her gentleness, she&#xD;
strove to define a certain distance that must be observed be-&#xD;
tween them. When he resented this by absenting himself&#xD;
from her for a week a1~ a time, there grew such a fear at her&#xD;
heart that he might be very deeply displeased with her, that&#xD;
she was docile and sunny and joyous under his returning&#xD;
beams of approbation. She lived in the happy present un-&#xD;
til some chance remark struck the wrong chord, and made&#xD;
her see that he supposed she would inevitably become his.&#xD;
One night she went to bed saying to herself; "I fear I love&#xD;
him !" This was after he had been singing, or after his&#xD;
voice had unconsciously fallen in speech upon a rare, deep&#xD;
tone :-the next night she went to bed saying, "the idea,&#xD;
the bare idea of my electing him to be my lord and master!&#xD;

the girls in the morning when they w~re on their way to&#xD;
woi~: he was not obliged to go to his office so early, but he&#xD;
chose tQ do so.&#xD;
Upon one of these mornings, Amy exclaimed, "Guess&#xD;
what I am studying !"&#xD;
"Mother Goose's Melodies ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DE~BI~OOK.&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not precisely. I am getting more profound. 'Locke&#xD;
on the Human Understanding'"&#xD;
"Would it not be as well to keep to your poetry and&#xD;
history ?"&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Well, women do not need to fill their pretty heads with&#xD;
heavy lumber. A young~girl ought to remember that home&#xD;
is to be her sphere, and that she may become a wife some&#xD;
day. I don't know that it would make iaer husband as hap-&#xD;
py to find her reading "Locke' as it would to see her mend-&#xD;
ing his stockings. She ought of course to know enough to&#xD;
pass creditably in society, but where there is on a woman's&#xD;
part too great a passion for research, there is~ usually too&#xD;
little taste for domestic affairs."&#xD;
A slight approach to a smile curved Amy's lip: her cheeks&#xD;
grew brilliant with suppressed disdain; she was too angry&#xD;
to trust herself to speak. George was half in jest and half&#xD;
in earnest in his remarks. "What do you think, little one&#xD;
he questioned after a few moments' silence.&#xD;
Amy dropt her veil before he caught the expression of her&#xD;
face, and replied in a low voice, "I think a woman should be&#xD;
the judge of her own capabilitiesand duties."&#xD;
"Usually: but in the family circle it sometimes happens&#xD;
that a husband and wife may disagree in a practical matter:&#xD;
a certain course of action is to be pursued: one must give&#xD;
up: which one&#xD;

&#xD;
only way to begin married life would be to have it under-&#xD;
stood that there must be a head to a family, and an umpire&#xD;
in case of disagreement."&#xD;
Amy's whole sWriv revolted at this conversation: it was&#xD;
so matter of fact for a lover, and underneath its current she&#xD;
recognized the arrogant assumption that 84e was to be the&#xD;
individual who was to give up. She did not see that George'&#xD;
was so honest he would not beguile her into a new position&#xD;
upon the understanding that she was always to have her&#xD;
way; that is the ordinary style, but it was not his style: she&#xD;
did not know h6w yielding George could often be, and how&#xD;
easy she would generally have found it to have harmonized&#xD;
herself with his wishes. She was at an age when the heart&#xD;
expects a perfect sympathy in disposition and mental en-&#xD;
dowment: she was too sanguine about life, too penetrating&#xD;
in detecting dissimilitudes of nature, and she had too little&#xD;
charityfor these dissimilitudes. When the sun's light and&#xD;
heat fall equally tempered upon the earth, they create sum-&#xD;
mer bloom and fragrance: light and love had not created&#xD;
this~garden of geiuiuine freshness in Amy's spirit yet: a win-&#xD;
try brilliance shone upon it, though she believed with the&#xD;
multitudB that there was no dew of youth separate from the&#xD;
springtide of years: it was more vital to her symmetrical&#xD;
growth that thorns and briars should be removed by a disci-&#xD;
pline suited to her character, than that she should 'marry this&#xD;
man or that: she had often given way to an impulse of un-'&#xD;
diluted coquetr5~; she had sometimes exulted in her power&#xD;
over her lover's haughty spirit, and had arrogantly said to&#xD;
&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
herself that it was not he who was master of the situation.&#xD;
It was i~n accordance with her free-will that she gave a turn&#xD;
tq her destiny at this epoch which she could not foresee.&#xD;
When she parted from George, he little dreamed that his&#xD;
seemingly'sensible remarks had like a pebble turned the cur-&#xD;
rent of his life: the woman who seemed drifting toward&#xD;
him, swirled around in the eddy, and was borne away from&#xD;
his side.&#xD;
Amy and Isabel went up a broad, dark stairway to the&#xD;
room where they folded books: Isabel was light-hearted irnd&#xD;
frolicsome with the yQUng girl who was beside hei': her sis-&#xD;
ter worked diligently ud silently with a fire in her eyes and&#xD;
glow upon her cheek -after an hour, the angry defiant fire&#xD;
was quenched by that she bit her lips hard to re-&#xD;
press. Her companions remarked hoxV very quiet she was,&#xD;
but there was no silence within her, and that passionate in~&#xD;
ward utterance which God hears broke forth thus, "Never!&#xD;
never! I have hesitated before to-day! I have been so wrapt&#xD;
around with his influence, that I saw no force within myself&#xD;
strong enough to make a change. Now I ask God to help&#xD;
me withstand myself 'and hi~'n. I. ask Him to show me why&#xD;
I can turn my face to George no more! I know too well! I&#xD;
cannot have combative feelings aroused by him: I caiinot&#xD;

changed a ring which she 'had wor~n for many years fropi one&#xD;
hand to the other. "There, my vow is made: my pledge&#xD;

would exact my duties: he could not look over an occasion-&#xD;

fanciful,-heaven knows my days are chained to hard prac-&#xD;
ticalities. Why should he prison one poor faculty? I slip-&#xD;
pose his intellect is superior to mine, but my little fancies&#xD;
are dear to me. I will never be broken in by him: I ~~'il1&#xD;
be my natural careless self. Sometimes when I have been&#xD;
defiant in regard to his advice, I have seen a flash in his eye,&#xD;
and a sudden settii~g of his lip, which revealed the thought&#xD;
passing in his mind, 'Snme day you may find yourself in&#xD;
my hands.' George needs to find out that every woman is&#xD;
not to be had for the, asking. I don't think I love him be-&#xD;
y()nd all things: when there is tenderness in his looks and&#xD;
voice, I-I am captured, but only for a season. I reflect his&#xD;
Iox~e on the surface, but the waves are stirred into billows&#xD;
when he shows that arbitrary disposition: now I don't intend&#xD;
to spend my life in trying to surmount such billows-~---l,&#xD;
don't want to quarrel with him forever. I want to have a&#xD;
pleasant time: my whole being has i~ot been moved o~ sat-&#xD;

MR. SECORD sat thoughtfully in an easy chair: he was not in&#xD;
his own house, for he was a bachelor; near him sat a lady&#xD;
of thirty-five; she was handsome, but her expression nega~&#xD;
tived her attractions, and did not create pleasure, although&#xD;
her features gave a sort of artistic satisfaction. Two girls&#xD;
of the respective ages of twelve ~nd fourteen, were playing&#xD;
a duett at the distant ~nd 6Ci the long parlor.&#xD;
"Girls i&#xD;
~, f you sound another note, I won't answer for the&#xD;
consequences !" cried the lady. "Pray stop, and go up&#xD;
stairs to study. I am sure you have ascertained the beau-&#xD;
ties of the piano by this time."&#xD;
"Let them enjoy it !" said her husband, who was slowly&#xD;
pacing up and down the spacious apartment.&#xD;
The lady merely waved her h~nd backward with an im-&#xD;
perative motion toward the door, as she eyed her daugh-&#xD;
tei's; they obeyed her, and quitted the room. After a few&#xD;
moments' silence, she looked at the gentleman who was sit-&#xD;
ting by the lace-curtained window, and exclaimed, "Justin&#xD;
Second! why don't you say how you like our new establish~&#xD;

nient? You have not been in the house before since it was&#xD;
completed and furnished !"&#xD;
"It 'is all very recherchc-very magnificent, and displays&#xD;
my sister in-law's good taste. Some of these days I must&#xD;
get a wife, and have a home like this."&#xD;
Mrs. Ashley smiled at the compliment to her taste ;all&#xD;
her interest in life was invested in outwqrd appearance and&#xD;
style. Her husband, who was only a half 'brother to his&#xD;
guest, exclaimed dryly, "Women never count the cost of&#xD;
anything !"&#xD;
"We never should have beautiful things if they thought&#xD;
much about such considerations, Clinton," responded his&#xD;
brother. "No one likes a fine house and turn-out better&#xD;
than you !'~&#xD;
Pshaw !" Mr. Ashley ran his hand through his bl:~ek,&#xD;
curling hair as he spoke: he was two or three years older&#xD;
than Mr. Second, morel handsome; but ~vith the same fine erect&#xD;
port: he was in his mental and rn~i'aI undress now; in so-&#xD;
ciety he never said "p~haw," but was exceedingly polite to&#xD;
every one, and had a slight precision in ~is tone and man-&#xD;
ner; he talked flowingly upon all subjects, as if he had a&#xD;
supply of prepared conversation at all times.&#xD;
Mrs. Ashley excused herself to her brother-in-law, under&#xD;
the pretext of answering notes of invitation, but in reality,&#xD;
she knew that the two gentlemen would feel more free to&#xD;
talk of politics or business, if they were left alorw~.&#xD;
As soon as she left the i'oom, and~ her hUsband's look had&#xD;
ascertained that the door was shut, he said, "Justin! your&#xD;
&#xD;
idea of, getting a wife is a poor one. iRemain as you&#xD;
are&#xD;
"You made a mistake, Clinton, in marrying a rich and&#xD;
fashionable girl: I should exorcise more judgment !"&#xD;
"Judgment !" echoed the other, with a bitter laugh.&#xD;
You'll find yourself deceived as well as the rest of us! Let&#xD;
well enough alone !"&#xD;
"here I am, forty years. old, Clinton, and I' have no&#xD;
family ties. I am rich, and I see no reason why~ I should&#xD;
not select a loveable little girl, and have a few cherubs frol-&#xD;
icking around tue. I should avoid a fashionable woman like&#xD;
a pestilence, and would seek a pretty witless creature who&#xD;
would adore me for myself. I shall get married 'some&#xD;
day!"'&#xD;
"Devilish agreeable you'll find ~t !"&#xD;
"So I think! glad you agree with me&#xD;
"Poh !" said his brother.&#xD;
"Any man, can get along comfortably with a wife, if he&#xD;
makeup his mind to it. I am alone in the world; I have&#xD;
tried various ways of being happy, and have failed: I can&#xD;
keep a wife handsomely, give her plenty of servants that she&#xD;
may have time to amuse me, and I think ~he ~peration&#xD;
will work. It makes a man selfish to have no one to care&#xD;
for 1"&#xD;
"Suit yourself! but let me tell you it is easier tQ get&#xD;
into the trap than out of it. All may seem fair at first. I&#xD;
was deluded fool that sighed like a furnace after that very&#xD;
woman who has just gone out of the door: there have been&#xD;

times since, when I felt as if I could raise heaven and earth&#xD;
to put a space between us. What does she care for me? I&#xD;
give her money and jewels, that is all she wants! Bah!&#xD;
she cares as much for me as I do for her, but you see~ it is&#xD;
necessary that we should be amiable ~before the world."&#xD;
'~ Yes," was the dry answer, "I think ydur pretense is in&#xD;
the style of high art. S~he loved you once: how is it that&#xD;
the genuine passion has etherealised itself' to such a degree&#xD;
that it is not to be found, ~and has left only the counterfeit&#xD;
upon your hands ?"&#xD;
"Loved me! she never loved anything but herself."&#xD;
"1 seem to recollect a certain letter you wrote me many&#xD;
years ago, in which you dilated upon~.-.."&#xD;
"Don't recall those silly rhapsodies! i've got past that&#xD;
foolish age !"&#xD;
In which you said, ''when I was thrown~ from my korse&#xD;
the angel fainted.' Didn't the passage run in that way T'&#xD;
A relentless smile was on Justin Secord's lip. "You know&#xD;
I never liked her, and advised you not to marry her; but I&#xD;
can tolerate her now much better than you can. As you&#xD;
intimate, you are in the trap, and you may as well make&#xD;
the best of it."&#xD;
"Am I not doing so?"&#xD;
~' After a fashion! The fact is, I am sorry for you,&#xD;
Clinton, but I can't help you,~you are the best of the two,&#xD;
for you have a soft spot under your waistcoat. There are&#xD;
those daughters of yours; they ought to be a comfort to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I do love my children: but they are not what they&#xD;
would be, if they had had a different mother." The two&#xD;
lapsed into silence, and Mr. Second finally rose, sayThg,&#xD;
"Well, I must go to my hotel: good night !"&#xD;
"Good hight !"&#xD;

ChAPTER Iv.&#xD;
AM~ sat by the workstand in her parlor a~one, for Isabel&#xD;
had gone out to spend the evening with one4ff her friends&#xD;
of the book-room: a lamp was lighted, and th~rou~h the par-&#xD;
tially closed blinds the soft air of September ~tole in, sway..&#xD;
lug the flame a little: Amy scarcely noticed~ this, for her&#xD;
thoughts were burdened with a restless wish that everything&#xD;
mig~t be different. She had noj seen Geor~o alone since&#xD;
the day that his conversation had been so distasteful to her:&#xD;
she had avoided meeting him often, but when he had seen&#xD;
h~r, she had looked a little pale, and seemed ~o gentle, he&#xD;
believed he saw her crowned with the very gPace that was&#xD;
needed to make her perfect. She knew that she was to&#xD;
stab his hope: she felt as if she could give him everything&#xD;
that she possessed-save herself! She hac~ a vague sense&#xD;
of having injured him, and a dread of the hour when he&#xD;
should be undeceived. She looted up from her work with&#xD;
a sudden recollection that even now he might find her&#xD;
alone: the street door closed: she started as if at the sound&#xD;
of approaching 1~attle, and sprang for 'safety into her little.&#xD;
chamber: she heard a step coming up the first flight of&#xD;
stairs, then up the second, quicker, lighter, happier in its&#xD;
&#xD;
tread: his familiar hand knocked at the parlor door; then&#xD;
*it flashed over her that. he could see a light beneath it.&#xD;
She wrung h~r two hands together with a senseless appeal&#xD;
for deliverance :-then came forth to give herself up to&#xD;
whatever lay before her: the excitement of his step&#xD;
sounded the depth of her resolution and her love: she grew&#xD;
~vhite at thot~ght of the combat with him: he seemed the&#xD;
stronger party. She opened the door, and inclined her&#xD;
head with scarcely a smile as she met the loving baptism of&#xD;
his dark eyes: she strove to speak and smile, but her lips&#xD;
had lost their mobility.&#xD;
"Amy, how very pale you are 1" ~he said with dangerous&#xD;
anxiety in his voice, "What is the matter~ ?"&#xD;
She turned her face a little aside from him as she closed&#xD;
the door. "What is the matter, dear !" he ~continued, plac..&#xD;
ing one arm almost unconsciously about her, atid leading.&#xD;
her to the window: she drew herself away as one might&#xD;
slowly turn against a strong, strong wind, and lai4 her hand&#xD;
upon the window-blind to push it open a little fur~her.&#xD;
"Is it anything that concerns me ?" he       asked&#xD;
with a shake in his voice.&#xD;
"Yes !" she answered, clenching the tassel of the window&#xD;
curtain: almost without looking, she saw that his chest rose&#xD;
and fell: he stood a moment then turned and walked up&#xD;
and down the room many times. At length he came to her,&#xD;
offered her a chair by which she stood, and gently touched&#xD;
her shoulder to make her sit down. She had resolved to&#xD;
stand, but she did not seem able to do otherwise than obey&#xD;

his gesture, and she seated her~eIf as he also did opposite&#xD;
her: he did not speak for an instant, then as if he disdained&#xD;
the timorous silence, he asked&#xD;
Amy, have you not known that I loved you ?"&#xD;
She was very silent.&#xD;
"have you knozvn it ?" he repeated more gently..&#xD;
She 'made a restless motion as if she would fain escape:&#xD;
he took her hand, "will you be my wife ?" he spoke&#xD;
scarcely above a breath, yet distinctly.&#xD;
She had seemed to herself prison-bound, as she strove to&#xD;
repress the tide that trembled through her: it was with&#xD;
effort that she answered, "I ~cannot !"&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
She tried to remove her chair a little, hoping thus to inti-&#xD;
mate that she was not to be persuaded, but his tone was&#xD;
half command, half entreaty, as he persisted, "tell me why,&#xD;
Amy !"&#xD;
"I should no~ like to' be your wife !"&#xD;
A dead silence fell between them, but the blows seemed&#xD;
lead that struck against George's heart. He said at length,&#xD;
"you hav~ not told me why yet !"&#xD;
"You would not let me be myself: act for myself:&#xD;
choose for niyself. You do not understand me !"&#xD;
"Would to God I did! wherein do I fail, 4rny ?"&#xD;
lie spoke with a humility so new to him, that her heart&#xD;
grew faint with pity. "Do not let us talk about it !" she&#xD;
entreated "only say good bye to me, and forgive me."&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is my right to know why you refuse me, when I have&#xD;
-had some reason to suppose you would not !"&#xD;
There flowed out in this remark somewhat of an impera-&#xD;
tive spirit: it was not natural to accept defeat.&#xD;
"George, you say I am too romantic, too self-willed:&#xD;
you have intimated that I have follies: that may be, but-"&#xD;
"I would only seek your best goad, Amy! I have been'&#xD;
too sincere to flatter. I have only desired that you should&#xD;
be still more lovely and perfect."&#xD;
"That is it !" she returned with a little petulance. "I&#xD;
am not lovely enough to suit you ! When I amend, I want&#xD;
to do it from my own impulse, and not be constrained to it&#xD;
by another. I appreciate domestic virtues in a woman's&#xD;
character, but I have no wish to cultivate them, to the ex-&#xD;
clusion of all higher tastes~ I know your feelings and&#xD;
tastes by casual remarks from your mother: you cannot ex-&#xD;
4      cuse any deviation from the ordinary track. We are both&#xD;
poor: if we were rich, you would not object to my painting,&#xD;
studying, embroidering, to my writing little tales to amuse&#xD;
myself. I like to do these things, but your' veto would be&#xD;
upon them, even if 'I neglected no household duties for&#xD;
them: you would imagine something must be amiss about&#xD;
the dinner if you saw me cultivating my fancy. I know&#xD;
that I have often seemed petulant and defiant: I am free to&#xD;
be so now, through it is wrong perhaps, but if I were mar-&#xD;
ried to you, policy 'might restrain my lips, when my heart&#xD;
K        was burning with a sense of injustice: I never would quar-&#xD;
rel as I have seen some women do :-but I will not place&#xD;

myselff in a p~sit~on where I might be tempted to. I wtsh&#xD;
from my soul, you had never thought of being more than a&#xD;
dear friend to me !"&#xD;
'You have not half comprehended me, Amy," he an-&#xD;
swered huskily, "I may have been exacting; I may be arbi-&#xD;
t~'ary, but there isa wretched depth of love within me, that&#xD;
I never fathomed until to-night :-if you understand it, you&#xD;
would have no fear in coming to me! I have no fear ex~&#xD;
ce~pt that you may vanish from my life! you are my daylight!&#xD;
God will teach me, to be gentle with you !"&#xD;
She softly shook her head, and rose to leave his side.&#xD;
"Amy !" his touch was very light, and instantly loosened,&#xD;
but she dropt powerless into the chair which she had quitted:&#xD;
all the pathos of his soul thrilled in his tone: that reverence&#xD;
for her womanhood which she had longed for, was in it also:&#xD;
she met his impassioned look, all unconscious that the lumi~&#xD;
nous, melting fire in her eyes showed how he swayed her&#xD;
heart: again he took her hand: she laid her face upon the&#xD;
* windowsill, but as a trembling bird, whose strength is in-&#xD;
sufficient to escape: passionate tears dropped from her eyes:&#xD;
only the word "farewell" sounded in her spirit.&#xD;
When George next spoke; his perfect honesty brought out&#xD;
* the prosaic side of his character. "I have never deceived&#xD;
y ou, Amy, when I have hoped you might cast your lot with&#xD;
mine. I believe you would be happier than you fear, though&#xD;
you might flQt be a plaything as some men's wives are:&#xD;
your duties would be many and not easy, but would not&#xD;
love be a compensation for a little toil? Would I were rich&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
for your sake ~ you know that I am heir to my uncle who&#xD;
lives in Spain, but I pave no right to* count upon his&#xD;
death !"&#xD;
She lifted her head, strong once more. George had mis-&#xD;
taken her emotion for a partial asset to his hopes, and he&#xD;
had again thrust before her a life of duty; she withdrew her&#xD;
hand; "love in a cottage". might be fascinating with a poet,&#xD;
but the view which George took of their wedded life, turned&#xD;
away her pleasure4hirstiflg spirit: somehow reality and&#xD;
common-sense are apt to be repugnant to young girls. She&#xD;
arose resolutely, saying, "George, I shall never be your&#xD;
wife 1" and then she went to her little workstand, took up&#xD;
her sewing, found the place where she left off, and seated&#xD;
herself; with an earnest pretense at work: she looked very&#xD;
calm and pale: George sat by the window : there was utter&#xD;
stillness in his attitude: the light breeze lifted tenderly the&#xD;
loose rings of dark hair from his shapely head: it passed&#xD;
over his forehead, his cheek, his lip: he knew as. little of its&#xD;
touch, as he did of God's love, which remembered him in&#xD;
his darkness. He sat thinking whether he could ~capitulate&#xD;
to despair; whether he could bend his proud nature to make&#xD;
a wild and last appeal: she was so young, just~ eighteen, how-&#xD;
could she be beyond entreaty? He went to her, "Amy&#xD;
will you not re-consider your words ?"&#xD;
"No !" she uttered in a low voice.&#xD;
"Is this your last word to me&#xD;
"The last !"          -.&#xD;
His handsome motith closed firmly: his listening figure&#xD;

grew erect, his pale face paler; though he was b~it little&#xD;
over twenty, he looked as if all the. iron determination of&#xD;
middle lift were concentrated in his breast, and as if he&#xD;
could tread out of existence any feeling that he willed should&#xD;
die: he had humbled himse1~ and she had rejected his ex-&#xD;
ceeding love. lie turned from her abruptly, took his cap,&#xD;
and went toward the door. She lifted the lamp, and foh&#xD;
lowed him into the narrow passage, not speaking until he&#xD;
had descended two or three steps.&#xD;
* "George!" she leaned over the banister, and held out her&#xD;
hand. "Good bye !"&#xD;
The light fell upon his black hair and Spanish features:&#xD;
the sternness passed from his brow, and an Unutterable soft-&#xD;
ness revealed itself in his gaze, as he studied the meaning of&#xD;
hers tremulous voice and most sorrowful eyes: he' pressed&#xD;
the little, cold hand that was extended to him: she drew&#xD;
away with a gentle inclination of the head-..with a shadow&#xD;
of decision upon her downcast face,&#xD;
It was all Over: they both felt it.&#xD;
When Amy was alone, she threw herself into a chair and&#xD;
abandoned herself to weeping: she was unconscious that she&#xD;
had lost a thing that might be regretted: she did not pity&#xD;
herself: she was very wretched because George was: the&#xD;
world was very large) there must be plenty of all kinds of&#xD;
love in it: plenty of success of all kinds, but only anguish&#xD;
was dealt out to her now. She ~vas wrestling against her&#xD;
first love: if she had h~id parents or guardians, she would&#xD;
without doubt have been engaged to George, for do not oldei'&#xD;

people make half the marriages that are consummated?&#xD;
Would they not have said to her, "My dear child, you do&#xD;

principles, of a reliable intellect, of a handsome address, of a&#xD;
noble heart, of good business capacities,-and last but not&#xD;
least, he loves you above all other women: and you like&#xD;
him better than any other man; if you live to be a hundred,&#xD;
you Will probably have worse offers, but no better: you&#xD;
xviii fade, and grow unattractive to eligible men: your natu-&#xD;
ral protectors will die, and you will be a most forlorn old&#xD;
maid : your friends will not want you in their families, and&#xD;
the earth will be entirely too small to accommodate you !"&#xD;
This style of influence was not brought to be ar.upoi~ the&#xD;
young gil'1, hence she acted upon her own sweet will, and&#xD;
found herself crying' because George Coleman would not&#xD;
come to see her any more: she wondered if he would pray&#xD;
that night; as the thought occurred to her, she dropt upon,&#xD;
her knees, and prayed for him with her whole soul. Isabel&#xD;
came home with blooming cheeks, and took off her bonnet,&#xD;
saying, "0, such fun, Amy, as we have had! I thought I&#xD;
never should stop laughing. I made one line of poetry,&#xD;
you see, and Jennie matched it with the most ludicrous&#xD;
turns !~' Thereupon Bel repeated some of the verses, and&#xD;
was aggrieved that Amy did not see the point of the&#xD;
joke.&#xD;
Amy saw only two pictures shifting alternately before&#xD;
hei' ;-one represented her standii~ at the altar with&#xD;

turned toward her. The other represented her as a weary,&#xD;

stricken out by her master's hand! 4&#xD;
*        *         *        *         *&#xD;
Ere a week had passed away, George Coleman was on&#xD;
his way to India as a sailor: his proud heart was stung and&#xD;
embittered, and ye~ could not save itself from the sudden&#xD;
softness and agony of love: the bounding of the billows&#xD;
gave a wild delight, and seemed at times to dulIthe sharp&#xD;
edge of Amy's woi~ds: but when the moon looked tran-&#xD;
quilly upon the waves, he saw only the luminous melting&#xD;
fire in her eyes : he believed that he would have been illib-&#xD;
eral in his requirements, had he gained his object without&#xD;
hindrance: when he looked into the silent sky, he thought&#xD;
he saw in the hush that the Great Supreme had detected his&#xD;
imperfection, and with relentless precision had sent an&#xD;
arrow through it, to transfix his every hope.&#xD;
The pilot-boat brought to land two letters from the new&#xD;
sailor: one was directed to Mrs. Coleman: the other fell&#xD;
into Amy's hands and read as follows:&#xD;
"Amy, I wish you well, and shall always remember you&#xD;
as a friend, should we never meet again. I am going to&#xD;
India! Your coquetry has sent me from my mother, from&#xD;
my native land: forbear hereafter to encourage love, when&#xD;
yoji mean to trifle with it: to reject it. Forgive my plain&#xD;
speech ~ it boots little to utter soft words! May God bless&#xD;
you!                                      GEORGE."&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DE~BR00K.&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
The pilot-boat had not passed from sight, ere George would&#xD;
have given all he possessed to have been able to recall his&#xD;
reproachful words: they had appe sed his pride, but they&#xD;
had gone: all that night he lay aw ke thinking, " if I had&#xD;
written generously, forgivingly, tenderly, it might have&#xD;
been that a year's absence would have changed Amy !-I&#xD;
might have won her at last! Aye, I have made the breach&#xD;
wider I',&#xD;
Amy read the cruel charge against her: it went down&#xD;
deeper every moment.&#xD;
"Do I wholly deserve this, Bel?" she asked, handing her&#xD;
time note.&#xD;
"No !" cried Bel, with indignant energy, after she had&#xD;
read it. "I'm sure you often avoided him~"&#xD;
Amy could not bear to have George blamed, and she said&#xD;
after a short silence, "I think it very natural he shoi4ild feel&#xD;
as he does-you know I did like him, and--perhaps I&#xD;
showed it sometimes-then I was ogten contrary. I thought&#xD;
1 was behaving as well as I could, but yet I suppose that&#xD;
coquettes act just as I did. He says, "May God ~bless&#xD;
you !" that is a comfort, but" her lip piivered; she rose&#xD;
and went into the little bed-room: there she moaned, and&#xD;
threw herself on the bed, and wept, and felt sure the dread-&#xD;
fQl sea would swallow up the friend ~vho seemed dearer to&#xD;
her even than Isabel: she blushed amid4 her tears as she&#xD;
acknowledged this, and believed that she was the most un-&#xD;
natural wretch living to feel so: it seemed treachery to.&#xD;
her sweet sister: she had not known that she eared so much&#xD;

"Poor soul !" sighed Isabel, without suspecting treachery&#xD;
toward herself: after a little reflection, she added, "Why,&#xD;
Amy, you needn't feel so wretchedly: write a letter, that&#xD;
will meet George when he reaches India, and tell him you&#xD;
will marry him: he'll forgive y~ou !"&#xD;
"Another woman might do that, but not I!" answered&#xD;
Amy, proudly: she arose and gathered up her h~Ur reso-&#xD;
lutely, saying, "Th~ past is dead, and will never bear fruit&#xD;
again. I ~an endure it, and I hope God will sustain&#xD;
George I" His letter had led her to sound her character&#xD;
and motives: it did her good, for it pointed out to her a&#xD;
tendency which she had not thoughtDf: she had in her com-&#xD;
position the elements of coquetry: she loved admiration,&#xD;
and' did not object to the influence it gav~ her: she remem-&#xD;
bered that at the room where she worked, there 'was a&#xD;
young printer who regarded her with a shy worship; some-&#xD;
times she had fouhd a white rose lying on her table when&#xD;
she arrived in the morning; she had usually placed it in&#xD;
her hair, sometimes in a little glass of water, but she had&#xD;
alwa~ s carried the gift home at 'night: the donor she had&#xD;

&#xD;
A~Y D~NBROOX.                    47&#xD;
only exchanged a few friendly words~ with once in a while:&#xD;
all this took a new aspect, when she searched her heart&#xD;
-she knew by the young man's changing color when he&#xD;
met her, that she was far more to him than he was to her:&#xD;
it is easy to be merciful when we are unhappy: sh~ made&#xD;
a simple and firm resolve to find no pleasure in that which&#xD;
must ultimately wound a f'ellow-creature~ After George's&#xD;
letter came, she wore no white roses in her hair when she&#xD;
was at work, and carried none home ~vith her. It was not&#xD;
in vain that George and Amy had met, had loved, and w'ere&#xD;
now suffering: it was the pain they felt that made them&#xD;
recognize the flaws in their natures. Yet methinks they&#xD;
saw no compensation; no coming brightness for that'which&#xD;
had retreated. Where does God keep all the splendor that&#xD;
is to come?&#xD;

"I was thinking that if we go through e~r~ry' moment&#xD;
doing all we ought, all \viil be perfect in the~ end. I have&#xD;
always thought of ha;?~'ing, and not of doing. I mean to&#xD;
take up my old studies! I can't fold books 'forever; there&#xD;
is too much time to think. I will prepare myself for ~a&#xD;
teacher."&#xD;
"Can you on with Latin without Georoe 2"&#xD;
"Yes, of course&#xD;
At this instant there was a knock at the door. Isabel&#xD;
opened it, and both girls saw with pleasure that it was Mr.&#xD;
Second: it was his evening to call fQr the rent. Bel placed&#xD;
a chair for him with alacrity, and Amy obtained the money&#xD;
due him, and gave it into his h end.&#xD;
"You are always prompt !" he said, with a kind smile:&#xD;
he had taken up a Latin grammar while Amy had gone into&#xD;
the next room for' the money. "Do you study this?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"I mean to study it more faithfully than I have hereto-&#xD;
fore done !" she replied; "I want to become a teaclThr 1',&#xD;
"Ah! perhaps I could, help you in your wish'!"&#xD;
"Help me !" she joyfully asked.&#xD;
"Yes! I have influence in one of our best schools, and I&#xD;
think if you wish it, I can get you a scholarship for a year:&#xD;
it will cost you nothing, and it will be an advantage to&#xD;
graduate from such an institution !"&#xD;
Amy's face was radiant; then she remembered that she&#xD;
must live, and how should she earn money.&#xD;
'"You are looking thoughtful now !" said Mr. Scored.&#xD;

Oi~ evening the sisters sat together sewing. Isabel was&#xD;
disposed to be social and agreeable, and Amy replied to&#xD;
her remarks, but not iyi a very animated strain.&#xD;
"Do, pray, be funny a few minutes !" said Bel, laying&#xD;
her fore-finger impressively upon ~he other's chin. "I&#xD;
thought you didn't like to see people get sober and prosy !"&#xD;
"I did not; but it seems to me now that I could never&#xD;
wholly love a person who was always gay: that is, after&#xD;
learning what real life is. I have been thinking lately how&#xD;
few friends we have! Did you notice that Mrs. Coleman&#xD;
treated me a little coolly when we called there the other&#xD;
morning?"&#xD;
"Why, yes! but she was 'as cordial to me as ever !"&#xD;
"Bel, I suppose there is such a thing as falling into a&#xD;
gloomy way of looking at things! I am cheerful by&#xD;
nature: I won't be overcome. Shall I read aloud to you?&#xD;
I borrowed this book on 'Thankfulness.' I feel so unthank-&#xD;
ful, it may help me!"&#xD;
She 'read awhile, then lapsed into thought. "That has&#xD;
done me good already !" said Bel. "What are you think-&#xD;

"Not because I am ungrateful !"&#xD;
"No, but because you are wondering if you can afford to&#xD;
accept thy proposition !"&#xD;
"You are good at guessing, sir !" she smiled with a certain&#xD;
lightness of heart, for Mr. Scored seemed good and helpful&#xD;
and strong, as if he saw a way through her difficulties.&#xD;
"Can you copy neatly'?" he asked.'&#xD;
"Shall 1 show you my writing, sir'?" She brought him a&#xD;
sheet of paper on which some verses were transcribed, and&#xD;
stood timidly watching his countenance for signs of con.&#xD;
demnation or approval.&#xD;
"This hand will do very well, if made larger and more&#xD;
distinct. I hire a man to copy for me, or rather have done&#xD;
so:, he has sought a more lucrative situation, as I c )uld not&#xD;
keep him employed steadily. If you will copy for me four&#xD;
hours on Saturdays, and one hour a day the, rest of the&#xD;
week, it will cancel your rent, and leave you something for&#xD;
other e4enses."&#xD;
"Oh that would be earning money so easily t"&#xD;
"If you do the same amount of work, Miss Amy, is it&#xD;
not fair that you should receive the same compensation that&#xD;
a man would 2"&#xD;
"I suppose it would be just, Mr. Second, but women are&#xD;
not compensated as men are 1"&#xD;
Amy looked with a pain in her heart at Isabel. " Bel,"&#xD;
she said softly,. "I. will te~ich you evenings everything that&#xD;
I learn !"&#xD;
"Thank you !" Isabel was thinking how lonely she&#xD;
&#xD;
should be, to go to the i~ook.room without Amy. Mr.&#xD;
Second arose: he laid, his hand on Isabel's head, and said,&#xD;
"Are you disposed to be studious too, my little girl'?&#xD;
Would you like to become a teacher'?"&#xD;
"0, so much !" she answered, and a tear rolled suddenly&#xD;
down her cheek.&#xD;
"Then I must get a scholarship foi you, and get you to&#xD;
do some copying for me. Will that suit you'?"&#xD;
"Will there be work enough for both of us'?" inquired&#xD;
Amy quickly. "I might find copying elsewhere."&#xD;
"My brother will be glad to get such work done through&#xD;
me, so have no fears !"&#xD;
"When shall we begin'?" said Isabel with a glowing, smil~&#xD;
ing, half tearful face. Mr. Second smiled at Amy, and then&#xD;
the child remembered in whose stately presence she stood.&#xD;
"You may begin next week, if it will suit you both !" he&#xD;
answered.&#xD;
"You have made us so happy !" said Amy: her lip&#xD;
trembled, as she dashed away a tear. "You have always&#xD;
been so kind to us since you knew ~&#xD;
"Ah! it is nothing at all. I chance to ~e so situated&#xD;
that I can do you a service as well as not. Miss Isabel,&#xD;
will you allow me to see your penmanship?"&#xD;
"0 Amy, what shall I show him'?" she whispered.&#xD;

laugh, said, write,&#xD;

&#xD;
To her thought, Mr. Second stood transfigured on Zion's&#xD;
hill: she glanced at him with a shy, smiling gratitude, while&#xD;
a sense of refreshment entered her heart, to think there&#xD;
were such good beings on earth.&#xD;
What did he think as he met her innocent expression&#xD;
and then leaned his head slightly over Isabel's shoulder? he&#xD;
thought her far more captivating then he did the day he&#xD;
first saw her: she was the "Loveable little girl" whom he&#xD;
had selected to marry, should she prove all he hoped. lie&#xD;
was a man of excellent judgment and due caution: he&#xD;
wished so to act that Amy shoiAd not suspect his object&#xD;
until he had won her heart: he looked most frequently at&#xD;
Isabel, and addressed her perhaps oftener in his ordinary&#xD;
calls: he was always dignified iii his graceful courtesy: yet&#xD;
nothing about Amy had ever escaped hin~i; her accent in&#xD;
speaking, the fit of her dress, the size of her hand, her&#xD;
changing color when she was in earnest, her method of sew-&#xD;
ing were all as familiar to him as to Isabel: he had re-&#xD;
volved many plans in his mind for sending her to ~chool,&#xD;
but he had never opened the subject, lest it should seem odd&#xD;
and startling; hence when the matter came up naturally, he&#xD;
was prepared for his part. The scholarship was a conve-&#xD;
nient term under which to conceal the fact of his bounty: it&#xD;
was enough to excite her gratitude, without oppressing her&#xD;
by a sense of obligation. She was a pretty vision to him:&#xD;
she had caught his~ fancy, and her presence came every day&#xD;
nearer his heart, though he did not seek her often as yet.&#xD;
When he had gone that evening, the sisters flew into each&#xD;
&#xD;
others' arms and cried and laughed: they found that they&#xD;
were so tired of their book-folding, so glad to enter upon a&#xD;
different lire: their sweet young faces shone as did that of&#xD;
Moses when he came down from the mount, and their&#xD;
happy talk and laughter rippled musically over dresses&#xD;
school-books and Mr. Second. They got down all the&#xD;
dresses they had, and began to make some desirable changes&#xD;
in them.&#xD;
"1 suppose nobody but himself knows how much good&#xD;
he does !" broke out Amy~&#xD;
"If we were rich, Amy!" suggested Isabel, "don't you&#xD;
think we should be delighted to find two orphan girls like&#xD;
us to help ?"&#xD;
I hope we should !"&#xD;
"If our dear parents only knew it !"&#xD;
"I always think of them when any good fortune happens&#xD;
to us. They taught us such a sweet and bright philosophy."&#xD;
"1-low would you like to open a boarding-school in the,&#xD;
country, Amy? You could be the principal, and I would&#xD;
be the assistant! I should think we could become compe-&#xD;
tent in a year !"&#xD;
It would be delightful! Would we be old enough&#xD;

I guess so!" decided Bel.&#xD;
K        flow    should you think Mr. Second is, Bel ~"&#xD;
0, why, forty or fifty, should'nt you think so&#xD;
"Yes! when people are not young, they look forty or&#xD;
fifty, or somewhere along there!"&#xD;

"Js'nt he gentlemanly and benevolent looking ?"&#xD;
"Very !"&#xD;
"Don't you wish he was an uncle of ours, or some rela-&#xD;
tion 3"&#xD;
"Yes1 indeed I do! I reverence him so&#xD;
"I'd be a butterfly born in a bower 1"&#xD;
sang Isabel joyously, then added, "Shall we wear our&#xD;
best bonnets to school 3"&#xD;
When Am~ and Isabel knelt with their arms around each&#xD;
other that night, and committed themselves to the Father's&#xD;
care, Mr. Second was pacing his room saying to himself,&#xD;
"What a perfect little angel she is !" and his idea of an&#xD;
angel was different from theirs. had Amy known his&#xD;
thoughts, she would not have fallen asleep with a smile on&#xD;
her lips-with an "All hail !" to the new future in her heart.&#xD;
She would have repelled her joy with a shock of pain, and&#xD;
would have turned back to her toilsome existence. Love&#xD;
for woman is most sure of a final return, when it drifts&#xD;
toward h5 without her knowledge: there was nought to&#xD;
startle the selected maiden, nothing to keep her grateful&#xD;
spirit from seeing the shining halo around her benefactor's&#xD;
head.&#xD;
The next morning Mr. Second took his prot6g~s to the&#xD;
school which he had chose~m for them: their i'epressed glad-&#xD;
ness, their sudden smiles, and childlike, admiring pleasure in&#xD;
him, which was mingled with a tender reverence, all gave&#xD;
him a keen refreshment. When they reached the handsome&#xD;
buildings before which they paused, a trepidation seized&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DE~BR00K.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
them, and half cau~lit away their rapture. It was too early&#xD;
for the assemblage of the pupils. Mrs. Barker, the principal~&#xD;
of the school, met Mr. Second with many smiles and bows&#xD;
and professed a deep 5n~erest in the dear girls. After a little&#xD;
*     conversation, Mr. Second left, and Isabel was removed to a&#xD;
*    distant department. ~The'lady inclined her head to Amy&#xD;
and asked, "What ar~ your acquiremnents, Miss Denbrookl'&#xD;
The young girl gav~ her estimate.&#xD;
"Then you have never taken lessons in music, my dear 3"&#xD;
"No mna'am !"&#xD;
"Mr. Second wishes particular attention given to it, ~s&#xD;
you heard him say !"&#xD;
"Yes ma'am V' was the reply, with a very willing look.&#xD;
"Italian 3"&#xD;
"I should like to study it, if Mr. Second think best!"&#xD;
+      "You draw, it seems, but do not 'paint! that you must&#xD;
learn! Is Mr. Sedord your uncle or guardian 3"&#xD;
"lie is our guardian n 1" was the answer after an instant's&#xD;
b&#xD;
consideration.&#xD;
Mrs. Barker left her, and then Amy looked around the&#xD;
room, and saw that it' w~ms occupied by but one person be-&#xD;
*    side herself. A young girl, apparently of her own age, was&#xD;
seated with negligent grace upon a long low bench: her&#xD;
elbow rested upon a dusk, and her hand supported her head&#xD;
as she looked at Amy.&#xD;
"It is a pleasant morning!~' she said smiling.&#xD;
"Yes !" returned Amy with an answering smile, and with&#xD;
the quick bound of frankness to her whole expression: she&#xD;

&#xD;
did not look like the reserved young ladf whom Mrs. Barker&#xD;
had addressed a moment before. "You are a scholar here,&#xD;
I suppose?"&#xD;
"Yes, I have been a pupil i~.ere a short time !"&#xD;
"Do you like it?" -&#xD;
"Very much ! I love study better than anything else !"&#xD;
"Doyoa? sodol!"&#xD;
"Then we shall be good friends 1 most of the girls study&#xD;
because they ?nu8t 1"&#xD;
"What is your name? Mrs. Barker did not introduce&#xD;
us!"&#xD;
"Agnes Leonard I"&#xD;
"I think you rather look as if that were your name 1"&#xD;
Amy said a little reflectively, then she smiled, and then&#xD;
laughed, as Agnes did.&#xD;
"Come sit here !" she indicated a place next her: Amy&#xD;
was sitting on a chair by herself: she arose immediately and&#xD;
obeyed; indeed there was something in the whole gentle&#xD;
aspect of the girl that won trust, and made Amy look up to&#xD;
her, as if she was in some way superior to herself; and yet&#xD;
like her. Agnes had looked at her quietly as if measuring&#xD;
her endowments: Amy could not so calmly have met her&#xD;
fixed regard, had she been caught in the s~me studying atti-&#xD;
tude; the stranger's eyes were of a dark blue, and they&#xD;
were very clear: her jet blaQk hair was swept back from&#xD;
her brow almost too severely: her mouth was firm and&#xD;
sweet, yet not fascinating: the nose and forehead were alto~&#xD;
gather beautiful: she was ~ handsome maiden~ upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
whole, although not showy or very striking 4 first sight.&#xD;
Her dress was of the finest material, and ~very neat: at a&#xD;
distance, one could not have said which of the VWQ was the&#xD;
better dressed, for Amy selected delicate patterns, if the ma-&#xD;
terial were coarse. For a moment she was silent, consider-&#xD;
ing the probable difference of position between herself and&#xD;
her new friend: and these same thoughts were passing in&#xD;
Miss Leonard's mind; she discovered that Amy's French&#xD;
chintz as she had supposed it, when taking an inventQry of&#xD;
her appearance, turned out to be a cheap calico. Miss&#xD;
Leonard was not wholly untouched by the prestige that&#xD;
wealth gives to an object: she liked refinement from the&#xD;
soul down to the shoes, though her rich tender nature could&#xD;
spare it in materialities: she looked again at Amy's profile,&#xD;
at her rosy finger nails, tipped with white. The silence that&#xD;
followed upon their girlish freedom said a greet deal to&#xD;
Arn5r: she had taken a fancy to Miss Leonard, a~ dhad di-&#xD;
vined her thoughts as her eye fell upon her dress: an indig-&#xD;
nant feeling stirred within her, but the belief that there was&#xD;
something congenial in her new acquaintance and a desire&#xD;
for such a friend overcame her pride. She lift4 her head,&#xD;
which had a little drooped as she played with the tassels Qf&#xD;
her silk apron, and said, "Your experience of life and mjne&#xD;
must have been somewhat different? Look !" she held ~&#xD;
fold of each dress between her thumb and finger, and strove&#xD;
to smile, but she blushed instead.&#xD;
Agnes laid her hand impulsively upon her~, and n~Jced;&#xD;
"Do you think I cannot appreciate anything but ~u~faee-&#xD;

life? I feel as if you and I shall begin today such a&#xD;
friendship, as 1 have always longed for. You think about&#xD;
the experiences of life, do you i? I wonder what the future&#xD;
will bring !"&#xD;
They talked earnestly and cordially for a few minutes:&#xD;
Amy was only conscious of a sensation of delight at having&#xD;
met a friend who seemed to understand her, and who was&#xD;
educated and refined: she felt as if Miss Leonard had occa-&#xD;
sion to rejoice also. Sudden and beautiful attachments are&#xD;
very easy to form in youth, when such deep treasure&#xD;
seems lodged man attractive face, and doubt and ddibera-&#xD;
tio~ never tjirow hindrances in the way of impulse~ The&#xD;
two girls were very sorry when the door opened, and ad-&#xD;
mittect another pupil, whose glance settled upon Aigy.&#xD;
"This is Miss Denbrook, Miss Blake !" exclaimed Agnes&#xD;
Leonard, without any of the embarrassment which school-&#xD;
girls are apt to feel in making an introduction.&#xD;
Miss Blake bowed slowly, and then came forward and&#xD;
offered her hand, with a hearty "How ar~ you ?"&#xD;
Amy received her greeting rather bashfully, for her per-&#xD;
fect ease and assurance took from her the u~e of the same&#xD;
qualities. Miss Blake was rather pretty, with an arch, in-&#xD;
telligent smile, and brown eyes in which intensified fun&#xD;
seemed to be asleep.&#xD;
"New scholar ?" she questioned, as she untied her bon-&#xD;
net-strings.&#xD;
Amy bowed and answered "Yes !"&#xD;
The demoiselle stationed herself ~t the window, which&#xD;
&#xD;
she opened, with her back to the two occupants of the&#xD;
room; she had a book in her hand, but she was constantly&#xD;
looking up from it, to observe the passers-by in the street.&#xD;
Agnes touched Amy's elbow, and motioned her to watch&#xD;
her. She xvas at the instant nodding with a coquettish air&#xD;
to a young gentleman who paused on the side-walk: she&#xD;
threw out a tiny bouquet, and then waved her hand for him&#xD;
to pass on: he caught the flowers, ~nd with a delighted&#xD;
smile, bowed, and obeyed her. When he was out of sight,&#xD;
she clapped her hands, and laughed gleefully: her school&#xD;
mates were laughing too.&#xD;
"You won't tell her high mightiness, will you 'I" de-&#xD;
manded, the sinner, turning around *as she heard their&#xD;
laughter.&#xD;
"Certainly not !" replied Miss Leonard.&#xD;
Amy only shook her head, but her interest was so appa-&#xD;
rent, Miss Blake laughed again delightedly, and asked,&#xD;
"'Don't you wish you had such a dapper little beau to make&#xD;
a fool of?"&#xD;
"Are ycu making a fool of him, Miss Blake? I thought&#xD;
you were in earnestt !"&#xD;
"0, you thought I was concentrating my imperishable&#xD;
affections upon a nose like that! a pug nose! no! he is to~&#xD;
genteel for me! I hate a genteel man&#xD;
"Don't make fun of him !" said Amy.&#xD;
"Why not ?" demanded the girl with a look of interest.&#xD;
"State the reasons logically !" she placed her hand on her&#xD;

side, aud stood in a listening attitude, contemplating ker&#xD;

"It isn't treating him as you would like to be treated&#xD;
is it?"&#xD;
" Good! what a little saint it is! I'll make it my spirit-&#xD;
ual adviser !"&#xD;
Amy reddened and set her lips together, taking up a&#xD;
book as she did so: her action said that there was no&#xD;
moral meeting-ground between her and Miss Blake: she&#xD;
did not like the ridicule that met her remark. There was&#xD;
something in Miss Blake's nature that made her symupathise&#xD;
with the quick, wounded exp~'ession that passed over the&#xD;
girl's face: she felt sorry that she had spoken so, but she&#xD;
did not want to yield. She spoke in a diffi~r5t tone.&#xD;
"Now why shouldn't I captivate him? I want to hang his&#xD;
heart at my belt, as the Indians hang the salps of their ene-&#xD;
mies! He is all scalp, he hasn't got any brains inside! he&#xD;
never had an original idea, except to adore the side of my&#xD;
bonnet in church, and to ~try to look into my bewitching&#xD;
countenance at all other times. I want to make him&#xD;
happy, you see&#xD;
Amy smiled ironically and incredulously, and replied,&#xD;
"Of course this matter does not concern me, only I feel&#xD;
sorry for him. You would, if he were a brother of yours,&#xD;
and I werO doing as you are doing toward him. I havc&#xD;
thought of such things lately I"&#xD;
A grave shadow passed over Miss Blake's conntenance:&#xD;
an expression full of feeling, but she said nothing, as several&#xD;
&#xD;
pupils were entering the school-room. lEre long the bell&#xD;
was rung, the school was opened, and the regular business&#xD;
of the day began. Amy made observations upon her school-&#xD;
mates, whenever she was not watched herself: many looked&#xD;
at her, and treated her as ladies treat each other at an even-&#xD;
ing party-as though they should never meet again: she&#xD;
particularly observed the movements of Miss Leonard and&#xD;
Miss Blake: the former wa1s the best schohir, and was ap~&#xD;
patently looked up to by all the pupils: she seemed to ac-&#xD;
cept her positioli as if it belonged to her-she was very&#xD;
kind, but a little queenly in her supremacy. Miss Blake&#xD;
exerted an equal influence but it was of a different character:&#xD;
she caused the teachers to~i h, and pretend they did not ob-&#xD;
serve her capers: she made some girls laugh beyond con-&#xD;
trol, and cover their        their two hands, or throw&#xD;
up the lids of their desk spasmodically for a screen-and&#xD;
other girls whose peculiarities she touched off with irresista-&#xD;
ble humor, glared at her with hurt and angry faces. rn&#xD;
the midst of this popular commotion, she would frequently&#xD;
cast a beneficent glance and smile at the new scholar; it&#xD;
lighted her features up. most attractively, and as it was half&#xD;
inquiring, Amy would send back a smile that was at once&#xD;
friendly and reproving, provided she was not laughing her-&#xD;
~elf: she found that she could not watch Miss Blake profita-&#xD;
bly, and anxious to gain a good reputation, she resolutely&#xD;
refused to take note of the corner in which the gay girl&#xD;
flourished. No one seemed able or willing to brave her, ex-&#xD;
cept Miss Leonard: ~t noon-time she accosted her with the&#xD;

words, "Miss Blake, if you have no wish to improve your&#xD;
own time, you certainly have no right to interfere with the&#xD;
studies of other pupils, as you did this morning !"&#xD;
"Stop !" cried the offending one, laying her pretty hands&#xD;
over .her ears, and shaking her white shoulders. "I've got&#xD;
but one life to live, and-"&#xD;
"And that should be lived worthily I"&#xD;
"You got that idea from me, my dear duchess. I forgive&#xD;
you, because it's flattering to be quoted !" ~she removed her&#xD;
self to a distance, and Miss Leonard turned to Amy, asking,&#xD;
"Did you ever see such a girl~"&#xD;
"She seems very wild !"&#xD;
"I never know how to take her! I cai'i't understand her. I&#xD;
wonder if she has a heart: she has more talent than any 01&#xD;
those girls around her: one can't help feeling an interest in&#xD;
her because she is not like every body else."&#xD;
"Do you think she is heartless ?"&#xD;
"I hardly know! what do you think? I saw you observ-&#xD;
ing her a good deal !"&#xD;
"I rather like her but I am a little afraid of her."&#xD;
"She likes you !"&#xD;
"Do you think so&#xD;
"Yes! if she didn't, she would have mimicked you all&#xD;
day, and would have performed all sorts of maneuvers be-&#xD;
hind your unconscious back."&#xD;
"0, you frighten me to think of what might have been !"&#xD;
laughed Amy.&#xD;
During the afternoon; when Amy's new experiences were&#xD;
&#xD;
less imperThtive upon her attention, she fell into reficetion up-&#xD;
on the life that seemed opening befoi~e her: the disparity of&#xD;
circumstances between herself and Miss Leonard oppressed&#xD;
her somewhat; she was as *proud in a certain way as that&#xD;
lady herself; she saw that there was no one in the whole&#xD;
school who was a fitting or beloved companion to her: in the&#xD;
morning her heart sprang with a careless joy to her, and her&#xD;
quick fancy clothed her with all perfection, but reverence&#xD;
was not indigenous to the soil of Amy's mind: she venerat-&#xD;
ed only intellect and goodness, the former far the more, and&#xD;
her friends must find these satisfactory in herself, or leave&#xD;
her. As her head was turned to Miss Leonard, the young&#xD;
lady who sat next her observed in a whisper, "Yqu knew&#xD;
her beforee you came to school, I suppose 1"&#xD;
No f"&#xD;
"She's an heiress! They live in grand style, and she don't&#xD;
forget it. She's a first rate girl, although we call her Queen&#xD;
Victoria sometimes !"&#xD;
"XVhy?"&#xD;
"0, she's so dignified, so kind o' stately. But it's against&#xD;
the rules to talk."&#xD;
When the school closed for the day, the two sisters met&#xD;
in the hail, and exchanged warm greetings. "11 ike it !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Isabel, dragging forward a fourteen~year-old maiden&#xD;
with whom she had interchanged vows, of never-ceasing&#xD;
fidelity. Amy took the little girl's hand with a smile, say-&#xD;
ing, "I am glad Isabel has found a friend in you: she will&#xD;
not be lonely."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Which way do you go, cara mia 9" inquired Miss Leon-&#xD;
ard, coming up, and encircling Amy's waist with her arm.&#xD;
An answer was given, and the two sallied forth into the&#xD;
street together: they walked silently a few minutes, then,&#xD;
with a brave effort, Amy said, "I suppose you ~ know,&#xD;
Miss Leonard, that Mr. Scored sends my sister and mc to&#xD;
school from pure kindness. Perhaps it would be best that&#xD;
you should understand, before entering into an intimacy."&#xD;
This was spoken candidly, but with pride; it riveted&#xD;
the kindness of Miss Leonard's regard it deepened her&#xD;
fancy into sincere affection, because it appealed to that&#xD;
which was truly good within her.&#xD;
"You know me very little, if you judge me by the&#xD;
many!" she said, "If I loved you, I would cling to you un-&#xD;
til death, if you were worthy, though all the world laughed&#xD;
at me for it."&#xD;
Amy returned the pressure of the soft hand that cl:isped&#xD;
her~, but she was not unmindful of the self appreciation that&#xD;
lay in the remark, nor that Miss Leonard believed that it&#xD;
was a valuable thing to gain her friendship. She said,&#xD;
"Love must make all things equal, else our attachment must&#xD;
begin and exid to-day. I must be judged by my heart, and&#xD;
mind, and by nothing else, inferior as these may be."&#xD;
"We understand each other !" responded Miss Leonard,&#xD;
and her eyes beamed with a starry softness: Amy smiled&#xD;
with an expression full of childlike trust, gratitude and&#xD;
admiration. They were very happy in this morning of their&#xD;
&#xD;
love: they found it pleasant to worship human nature with-&#xD;
o u~suspicion.&#xD;
"I shall not be as frank with others as I have been with&#xD;
you. It does not matter to the other pupils how Bel and I&#xD;
are sent here.~~&#xD;
"No! you're right !"&#xD;
"I could be frank with Miss Blake: she, I know would&#xD;
like people for what they are."&#xD;
"Still I wouldn't tell her! she wouldn't care."&#xD;
This heed of public opinion, so naturall to young&#xD;
girls, Miss Leonard's after-life was to defy, to disdain. We&#xD;
hear much of the innocence and simplicity of youth, and&#xD;
among retrograding characters there was once doubtless a&#xD;
freshness which time killed in its advance, hence the sorrow-&#xD;
ful eye that looks backward, and the hopeless one that&#xD;
looks forward. But true candor and freshnesssometime~&#xD;
become more actual and living qualities with years: foolish&#xD;
little arts are discarded: restless hopes settle into one great&#xD;
hope, and the light that beams from God floods this mortal&#xD;
existence with just perceptions of others and ourselves.&#xD;
The world holds a large class of people who look, at middle&#xD;
life, over the ocean of the past, only to descry a fairy isle,&#xD;
whose like they never shall meet again: perhaps these un-&#xD;
happy ones h'~ve stumbled on to riches and honor, pouring&#xD;
Qut strong energies to attain them, bu tthey have not won&#xD;
such wishes as yield a delight daily, and bear transportation&#xD;
to the land that looms to sight at the end ,~f earthly&#xD;

As the young girls walked on, they were overtaken by a&#xD;
gentleman of abdut twenty-five; he was travelling rapidly,&#xD;
but took time to look in Miss Leonard's face with the cx-&#xD;
ejamation, "fley, Agnes !" then his quick tread hastened&#xD;
on; in a moment he joined Miss Blake, who was sauntering&#xD;
slowly along.&#xD;
"Shall I carry your books, Miss Diana ?" he asked&#xD;
laughingly, after he had lifted his hat and bowed.&#xD;
"Certainly !" she replied, with a coquettish light playing&#xD;
over her fhce. Amy and her friend purposely dropped be-&#xD;
hind, to be out of hearing distance, but they could see the&#xD;
pretty bearing of Miss Blake, and the pIeasi~re that beamed&#xD;
in her companion's face as he jested with her: he was tall&#xD;
and well proportioned, but rather attractive-looking than&#xD;
handsome in feature; his air and laughter, for his voice&#xD;
could not be heard distinctly, were full of character and in-&#xD;
telligence.&#xD;
"That is not the gentleman to whom Miss Blake tossed&#xD;
the flowers this morning ?" observed Amy.&#xD;
"He is my brother !"&#xD;
"Indeed! you do iiot much resemble each other !"&#xD;
"And yet in many respects we are alik6. I have often&#xD;
wondered how he could be so pleased with Miss Blake: she&#xD;
is without principle in everything that she does, and Marcus&#xD;
is so high-principled, so studious, and noble in his aims."&#xD;
"There may be a few points of character where they can&#xD;
meet heartily, and he takes it for granted that she is charm-&#xD;
ing in all other respects."&#xD;

"He always insists that I don't understand her, if I in-&#xD;
timate that he had better lessen his admiration. She is very&#xD;
fascinating when she chooses to be: the most beautiful girls&#xD;
fall into the shade beside her in company."&#xD;
"Do you stop here ?" questioned Amy, as Miss Leonard&#xD;
laid her hand upon a stone balustrade that led up to the&#xD;
front door of a stately house.&#xD;
"Yes! I live with an uncle and aunt: I am an orphan a~&#xD;
xvell as you, Miss Deubrook. Call for me in the morning, as&#xD;
you go to school, xviii you ?"&#xD;
"I don't know! if you will sit at a front window I will !"&#xD;
"Well, I'll be watching for you at the dining-room win-&#xD;
dow! I'm so glad we have met: we think and feel so much&#xD;
alike about everything!"&#xD;
They parted, believing that they should always see things&#xD;
alike, as they had seen them that day, for the seal of syinpa-&#xD;
thy had dropped upon every uttered thought.~&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
AMY and Isabel h~d attended school hut a few weeks,&#xD;
when the former encountered Mr. Second one afternoon on&#xD;
her way home: she looked up in his face with an ex-&#xD;
pression of bright confidence, which he answered by turning&#xD;
about, and offering his arm, with the words, "how are you&#xD;
getting on with your studies, my dear ?"&#xD;
"Very ~velJ, I think! I am going to a party to-morrow&#xD;
evening, at one of the girl's houses." Seeing that he looked&#xD;
a little grave, she added, "If you approve, of course !"&#xD;
"You had bcttem~ go this time, as you are expecting it:&#xD;
but while you are at school. I had rather your mind should&#xD;
not be directed from, your studies."&#xD;
"I will stay at home, if you say so, sir! I want to do&#xD;
exactly as you would have me !" she lifted her grateful&#xD;
eyes so earnestly, that he was assured the deepest wish of&#xD;
her heart was to obey him: a pleased satisfaction passed&#xD;
over his countenance, and he said with some heartiness,&#xD;
"Go this time! Where is it to be? who gives the&#xD;
party ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Harrington dives ~t, but she permits her niece,&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Leonard, to invite a few of her school-mates, and I am&#xD;
of the number."&#xD;
are you intimate with Miss Leonard'?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir! we think everything of each other: she is the&#xD;
noblest girl I ever saw&#xD;
Mr. Second smiled peculiarly, and said, "You are very&#xD;
school-girl ish-you haven't lived in the world long, Amy !"&#xD;
She reflected on his meaning, and thought if he supposed&#xD;
that anything upon earth could ever lessen her new friend-&#xD;
ship, how mistaken he was, but she regarded him as too&#xD;
much above her in years and experience to dispute the&#xD;
point.&#xD;
"Do you visit Miss Leonard often ?'~&#xD;
"Yes, sir! two or three times a week: some of our las-&#xD;
sons we always study together; I pass her house in return-&#xD;
log from school, and she persuad'~s me to go in and run up&#xD;
in her room an hour or two."&#xD;
"Do you like Mrs. Ilarrington ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir! she is a very gentle lady."&#xD;
"Does Miss Leonard ever come to study with you?"&#xD;
"Nqt very ~ften! she comes Saturdays sometimes for&#xD;
to take a walk with her. Once she came in a carriage,&#xD;
and took Bel and me ridin~"&#xD;
"I always supposed Miss Leonard was an exceedingly&#xD;
proud girl!"&#xD;
"Are you ~vell acquainted with her, sir?"&#xD;
" Yes,~ have known the family some years. I am in-&#xD;
vited to the party to-morrow night !"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Is it possible?" She was a trifle disappointed, for she&#xD;
felt as if he would watch her,~ and desire her to appear well,&#xD;
when she feared that she should be far less at ease, than&#xD;
when she was tripping along at his side.&#xD;
"1 will call for you, and take you thei~e !"&#xD;
"Thank you, sir !"&#xD;
"Had von an escort provided ?"&#xD;
"No, sir! Miss Leona~rd said I must come before dark,&#xD;
and then I could help her with the flowers; but I might soil&#xD;
my dress, and I had rather not be there so long in magnifi-&#xD;
cent array!"&#xD;
Mr. Second gave a light~ laugh, and said, "You have a&#xD;
superb wardrobe, little friend !"&#xD;
"When I come out in my white dress tomorrow evening,&#xD;
I shall look deceitfully aristocratic, because the most gorge-&#xD;
ous silk is not so pretty an evenIng dress as a light snowy&#xD;
one."&#xD;
"That's true !"&#xD;
With her own father, Amy had hardly felt more free than&#xD;
with Mr. Second: he always seemed interested in little&#xD;
things that concerned her, and was so patient and indulgent&#xD;
in his goodness, that her heart reverenced him beyond any&#xD;
other human being; it wus this childlike trust that made her&#xD;
very frank and careless in the expression of her thoughts at&#xD;
times.&#xD;
The evening for the party arrived, and Amy donned the&#xD;
Swiss muslin that was already two years old: it had passed&#xD;
through her busy fingers for a remodelling, after she had one&#xD;
&#xD;
afternoon promenaded- Broadway, and looked at handsome&#xD;
ladies, and slowly eyed showcases With tissue-paper sleeves&#xD;
an~ waists: her observations had been summed up, and with&#xD;
her labors, they culminated in her modernized white dress.&#xD;
She had but one jewel to wear, and that gwas a bracelet of&#xD;
her mother's; a breastpin she possessed, but it was of an&#xD;
ugly fashion, so it was laid aside as unsuitable, and a crim-&#xD;
son rose took its place; this rose and a half blown white&#xD;
one blossomed on the plants that George had given her and&#xD;
Ri: she picked them with a sweet, sad ru~h of thought, but&#xD;
the prospect Qf a brilliant evening prevented her from de-&#xD;
voting much melancholy to the past: her luxuriant chesnut-&#xD;
brown hair was twined in a world of ringlets to fall over a&#xD;
comb at the back, apd Qthers shaded slightly her brow and&#xD;
neck; the w!~itc rose with many green leaves trailed upon&#xD;
one side. While Isabeiwas saying, with her pretty head&#xD;
turned critically aside, "Why, Amy, if you were born to a&#xD;
A knock at the door announced Mr. Scored, and inter-&#xD;
rupted the remarks of 13e1. Amy looked at hini a little&#xD;
anxiously, fearing he might deem her dress plain for the&#xD;
occasion, but the ad miring smile that broke over his fhce,&#xD;
set her at rest. She flitted about the room, picking up rose-&#xD;
leaves, and dancing a little when Mr. Scored'~ head was&#xD;
turned, then subsided with a solemn eye upon Isabel. Mr.&#xD;
SecQrd laughed as he discovered this pantomime, and then&#xD;
took her shawl from a chair and wrapt it around her.&#xD;
When they left, Amy said, "You shall go to parties too&#xD;

&#xD;
when you reach my age, Bel. Don't sit up for me, darling!&#xD;
I shall have so much to tell you to-morrow. Go down in&#xD;
Mrs. Walcott's room."&#xD;
When 'they were stated in the carriage, Mr. Scored asked,&#xD;
"Are you in the habit of associating familiarly with the peo-&#xD;
ple i n~ the house ?"&#xD;
"B ~l is intimate with Lizzie WaleQtt; we are hot very&#xD;
social with any one else !"&#xD;
fir~t time I called, I went into ,the rooms of the two&#xD;
families in the house, and I thought they were not partieular-&#xD;
ly refined !"&#xD;
"No! they are not! but Lizzie Walcott is an honest little&#xD;
soul, and I am always sure Bel will learn no harm from her."&#xD;
"It is a harm to her to have her manners tinctured&#xD;
with the ways of such people."&#xD;
Amy felt a warm tide mounting to her brow: she was&#xD;
struck with astonishment that her companion's heart did not&#xD;
overflow with kindness toward the families in the house;&#xD;
but her trust in him was a beautiful lever to adjust anything&#xD;
that momentarily surprised her: she thot~ght that he had&#xD;
'measurably adopted herself and Bel, and that he desired that&#xD;
they should be very pure and delicate in all respects, and&#xD;
should learn no coarseness or evil of any one: she remem-&#xD;
bered that he was unaware of the real goodness of the people&#xD;
he referred to, and that it was 'exceedingly thoughtful in him&#xD;
to desire to protect them from harm. How often, and how&#xD;
unweariedly have we seen noble natures giving to doubtful&#xD;
sentiments or actions, a blessed motive. After a mental&#xD;
&#xD;
process of this kind, Amy said, "They are good, Christian&#xD;
people, I esteem them~ although our tastes are different: I&#xD;
never 'thought particularly about Bel's catching unrefined&#xD;
habits from Lizzie !"&#xD;
"These things ought to be considered: perhaps it would&#xD;
be well for you to che~k Isabel's pen4~~hant a little."&#xD;
Again an uneasy sensation sent the color ~o her face:&#xD;
she answered slowly, "I'll try to manage i~ so that Lizzie's&#xD;
feelings won't be hurt: the intimacy can tbe gradually less-&#xD;
ened, sir !"&#xD;
"You can manage it, Amy !" he spoke in a tone of con-&#xD;
fidence, and then conversed upon other things, until they ar-&#xD;
rived at Mrs. Harrington's.&#xD;
When Mr. Second entered the parlor, with his ward lean-&#xD;
ing upon his arm, half-clingingly, half-confidently, his heart&#xD;
rose with secret ~ratification to see that others thought her&#xD;
very lovely: after greetings had been exchanged with the&#xD;
host and hostess, Miss Leonard took Amy's two hands with&#xD;
a warm smile, whispering, "You look like a little syiph !"&#xD;
Mr. Scored's attentive ear caught this ~remark, and she was&#xD;
v~dued all the more, because others praised her. When&#xD;
Miss Leonard's attention was demanded elsewhere, Mr.&#xD;
Second l~d Amy directly to a lady. and gentleman who had&#xD;
been observing them from the moment of their entrance :&#xD;
he introduced her first to the gentleman; as the lady turned&#xD;
away to speak to some one, when sure of their approach:&#xD;
this did not confuse Mr. Second, for he was an unusually&#xD;
self-possessed man: he spoke urbanely, "Brother, thi5 is&#xD;

AMY DENJ31~O0K.                           AMY DENBROOK.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Amy Denbrook of whom you have heard me speak!&#xD;
Mr. Ashley, Amy !"&#xD;
She accepted the offered hand almost in silence, wonder-&#xD;
V             ing if the lady turned away at that moment accidentally or&#xD;
intentionally.&#xD;
"Mrs. Ashley !" called her brother-in-law in a low&#xD;
* voice: she was not speaking at the moment: she turned&#xD;
around all smiles, as if she had not the most remote suspi-&#xD;
don of his intention. "Miss Denbrook-Mrs. Ashley !"&#xD;
His tone was a little determined.&#xD;
The lady bowed with some hauteur in her black eyes.&#xD;
Mr. Second partially turned Amy to his brother, who imme-&#xD;
diateJy began a conversation with her, into which he scat-&#xD;
tered, a few artful compliments : Mr. Second removed him-&#xD;
self to a slight distance, but his attention was not diverted&#xD;
from the blushing girl, who timidly replied to the easy flow&#xD;
of talk addressed to her. Mrs. Ashley devoted herself to&#xD;
Miss Leonard, for whom she had evidently an exceeding&#xD;
fancy. "Do you like Miss Denbrook ?" she whispered.&#xD;
"Yes! I more than like her: I have a fr~endshi p for.&#xD;
her !" she replied, looking steadily into the haughty face&#xD;
before her: she had observed the cool manner in which&#xD;
Amy had been received; it awakened resentment, and&#xD;
II&#xD;
made her own heart gush out with generous love.'&#xD;
"She possesses talent, I suppose, if you like her !" Mrs.&#xD;
Ashley found it difficult to understand how' so stately a girl&#xD;
as her young friend Agnes could have formed an intimacy&#xD;
with Miss Denbrook.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yes'! Nature has crowned her with beautiful gifts 1"&#xD;
Mrs. Ashley perceived that she ~vould not be alone, if&#xD;
she supported th~ poor, obscure girl, and thinking Justin&#xD;
Second might consummate his~ present folly by marrying&#xD;
her, ~he resolved to be a little n~ ore affable.&#xD;
"Don't you find it warm here, Miss Deubrook ?" she,&#xD;
0&#xD;
asked, after having turned toward her with a brief silent&#xD;
inspection.&#xD;
"It is a little warm !" was the quiet reply: involun-&#xD;
tarily Amy's eyes turned to Mr. Scored: she did not feel&#xD;
at home, and she wished he would take her to another part&#xD;
of the room: he met her look very calmly, and' she saw&#xD;
that he had no intention of paying heed to her wishes: she&#xD;
wondered at this, not knowing that he did not care to have&#xD;
his relation to her talked about. Miss Leonard came to the&#xD;
rescue, after she had been to Mrs. llarrington's side with&#xD;
therequest, "Aunt, please pay some attention to Miss Den-&#xD;
brook-Mrs. Ashley treated ier c6olly !"&#xD;
"Yes, dear !" was her aunt's reply.&#xD;
Amy was soon made to feel at ease, and saw herself in&#xD;
the iiiidst of a group of people, laughing and chatting with&#xD;
a very witty young gentleman: she did not however lose&#xD;
the opportunity of taking general observations: she saw Miss&#xD;
Blake performing ~he part of a belle with an infinite charm;&#xD;
arnoiig the lively circle that surrounded her, Marcus&#xD;
Leonard appeared, and to him were the sunniest smiles&#xD;
given, and for him were the merriest sallies spoken. Agnes&#xD;
turned again and again to the coquette with grave 'obser-&#xD;

&#xD;
vance: the difference in the demeanor of the two girls was&#xD;
most striking.. Agnes, unmindful of her youthful years,&#xD;
exacted an almost reverential manner from gentlemen: if&#xD;
they trifled with her, as they might with Miss Blake or&#xD;
Amy, she did not meet them on their own ground: her&#xD;
calm and deeply cutting sarcasm remindec~ them that she&#xD;
0&#xD;
thought herself superior to their nonsense: yet she was&#xD;
cordial and gay with many, and when at Amy's side, she&#xD;
laughingly entered into the merry jesting that was going on&#xD;
between her and the witty young gentleman: her fondness&#xD;
for her friend made her enter ii~to her feelings. Diana&#xD;
received compliments believing only half of them, while&#xD;
Agnes was in reality more accessible to flattery-she quietly&#xD;
believed the whole. When the dancing commenced, Amy's&#xD;
hand was perpetually sought: it delighted Agnes to see the&#xD;
homage divided between her and Miss Blake, and yet to her&#xD;
chagrin, she perceived\ that her brother was conscious only&#xD;
of the letters presenc~. In the sudden sunshine of adula-&#xD;
tion, the once, checke~1 fault of Amy's nature broke out&#xD;
anew: she revelled in~ the admiration* that she excited with&#xD;
a joyous abandon: it inspired her with grace, and bewitch-&#xD;
ing woxds and ~zaivete: unmindful of all but the present&#xD;
moment, she was deep, her will was active and not passive&#xD;
under temptation; in all the; intricacies of coquetry: she&#xD;
was more timid in manner then Miss Blake; she wag less&#xD;
brilliant, but more winning: her kind heart and tact pre.&#xD;
vented her from wounding the feelings of others, butt they&#xD;
&#xD;
were dangerous allies in her present crusade. Mr. Second&#xD;
was a rein upon her-she desired that he should be satisfied&#xD;
with her, and her looks and words were more subdued after&#xD;
slip had encountered his obsePving eyes: but he was an out-&#xD;
ward rein only, for the inward control of will and high&#xD;
principle was temporarily wanting. lie marked all that&#xD;
occurred well: he was pleased and proud to see the position&#xD;
of the pretty orphan: he saw the effect that she produced&#xD;
but did not care for the moral harm that might touch her:&#xD;
on the other hand, it galled him to see how lightly and&#xD;
heartily she entered' into the spirit around her; he saw that&#xD;
she might easily b~ ~von away from him by younger men,&#xD;
~ and he resolved that this should be the last party that she&#xD;
should attend before they were lighted: her happy and&#xD;
careless manner toward others assured him that she did not&#xD;
ypt suspect herself appropriati~d by one: something with-&#xD;
held him from taking the character of a lover before her&#xD;
astonished eyes then; the way must be gradual to her&#xD;
afThctions, and yet the wealthy landlord found himself actu-&#xD;
ally in love that evening, and he could not throw off the&#xD;
embarrassed sense of weakness: he felt as if his eyes&#xD;
would drop to the ground if the hazel ones of the girl were&#xD;
lifted to his with their childish trust. He wrestled against'&#xD;
his fully, and his characteristic secretiveness triumphed, and&#xD;
gave him power to conceal the current of his emotk~n~: he&#xD;

h~s prot6g6 occupied. A little after twelve o'clock, he found&#xD;
himself near her, and asked, "Are you ready to go,&#xD;
Amy?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir !" she answered, quite disappointed that she&#xD;
must leave the fascinating scene long before many others.&#xD;
"Then leave the rooms quietly, and I will be in the hail&#xD;
'V when you come down stairs 1"&#xD;
"Shall I bid Mrs. Jlarrington good evening' sir ?"&#xD;
"No! it is not late, and she would n~t wish the leave.&#xD;
V taking to put others in mind to go."&#xD;
She stole from the room, but when on the stairway, she&#xD;
cast a lingering look into the parlors, and said to herself;&#xD;
"0) if the dear man could only rem ember how he felt when&#xD;
he was young himself; he would not tear me away in the&#xD;
IlIf          'midst of such a splendid time !" sudde~ily she espied him&#xD;
iii&#xD;
makiun- his to the hail, and she incontinently ran up the&#xD;
~ way&#xD;
stairs, lest he should see her looking back to Paradise.&#xD;
If1             In a few moments she joined him in the hall with a smiling&#xD;
face; as the carriage rolled toward home, she forced her&#xD;
thoughts from their natural channel, to chat about the peo~&#xD;
plewhom sh~ had seen. When she entered her little home,&#xD;
and saw Bel sitting alone at the table, fast asI~ep, she thought,&#xD;
"lie was more con~iderate than I, to make me come home&#xD;
in season to this poor child !"&#xD;
~he threw off her shawl, before she awoke Isabel from her&#xD;
profound slumber.&#xD;
" You can tell me to-morrow !" said the half aroused girl,&#xD;
as she undressed and instantly sped into dream-land again.&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
Amy's faculties were all awake; she seated her-&#xD;
self in the little rocking chair, and a delicious tide&#xD;
of thought ran oyer her light heart: she murmured&#xD;
inly, "1 shall have many years of such happiness as&#xD;
this! I have at last reached just such careless joys as&#xD;
I used to dream about after reading novels. I neVer knew&#xD;
before to-night that I was attractive, like many girls I&#xD;
have seen! It seems so strange, so wonderful! I thank God&#xD;
for it! Ah! perhaps 1 thank him selfishly, but I love to&#xD;
dance on roses !" She buried her face in he~' hands and&#xD;
dreamed a long while, then ~he thought. "I must read a&#xD;
verse in the Bible, I can't read a chapter to-night !" but&#xD;
when she raised her head, the lamp had just died out; she&#xD;
was conscious of a feeling of relief; for she was not in a mood&#xD;
for scripture reading: she undressed herself in the darkness;&#xD;
involuntarily her soul broke forth, "Fath5! mother!&#xD;
what would you say to me now? I know that a flood of&#xD;
worldliness is sweeping in upon me! I know that to angels'&#xD;
eyes I am not lovely this i~ight! I have exulted in myself!&#xD;
not one unspotted thought for others, pleasure has had birth&#xD;
within me! I turn to earth too passionately, I shade my eyes&#xD;
from heaven! only sweet, seducing laughter reaches me, and&#xD;
itssiren sound is lulling! Ah! I must drink the bewitching&#xD;
draughts; I cannot mount a step of my Jacob's ladder at&#xD;
this time !" Amy did not know it, but it was the remem-&#xD;
brance of Mrs. Ashly's cold look that bad led her mind from&#xD;
satisfaction to reflection. For an instant she stood in the&#xD;
deep gloom around her, with her clasped hands dropped be-&#xD;

fore her: she hesitated whether to pray, COnSCiOUS that she&#xD;
felt no desire to become spiritual: religion seemed so cold&#xD;
and prosaic; it had no charm, no rainbo~v glory, no exalt-&#xD;
ing poetry: it simply said, "The happiness of tlis night S~&#xD;
not healthy, for it d4racts from your enthusiasm fur Godi&#xD;
and the right." She wavered still, almost unconsciously&#xD;
asking herself "Shall I throw myself on the Lord's side,&#xD;
and beseech him to make this experience an ascending step&#xD;
in the £cale of my life? Does not the Lord's prayer mean,&#xD;
'Lead u~ not into temptation, but to deliver us from evil V&#xD;
and I have seen an evil tendency in myself this night. I am&#xD;
not willing to turn away from such adulation! I desire to&#xD;
exercise the power I have been made conscious of !~No!&#xD;
If I pray, it will be mere hypocrisy !-I don't want to amend&#xD;
now I perhaps in a few days, I shall feel differently !" so she&#xD;
sought her bed, and sleep fell balmily over her senses, but in&#xD;
all its extent she did not read the effect of her de~ision.&#xD;
Even if she should arise, and take up her march to her&#xD;
Father's Hou~se very soon, she had lost some of the splendor&#xD;
that might ha~ e accrued? to her. The Great Creator did not&#xD;
so quietly resign her good: He did not hesitate in his design&#xD;
to stay her faults, that her aforetime appeal might be grant-&#xD;
ed. She had with yearning heart and tearful eyes read the&#xD;
words, "Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us !"&#xD;

When Amy went to school the next morning, Agnes and&#xD;
Miss Blake were already there with a few other pupils; 'as&#xD;
&#xD;
it was early, the latter damsels went into a recitation room&#xD;
to talk over a secret; Diana immediately stationed herself&#xD;
at the windoW to dash off some little fascination to the inno-&#xD;
cent young man who was expected to pass. Miss Leonard&#xD;
watched her with a severe expression, for her brother's&#xD;
charmed affections were in her thought: at length she said&#xD;
in a cold cutting voice, "Miss Blake, you may trifle with&#xD;
others, but I wish you to understand that I will not have my&#xD;
brother trifled with !"&#xD;
Miss Blake turned around like a Pythoness at bay: her&#xD;
eyes filled with defiance, her lip curved, and she haughtily&#xD;
answered, "I shall please myself; Miss Leonard, in all my&#xD;
actions," and thereupon, she turned her back upon Agnes,&#xD;
and gloomily looked down upon her book: for ten minutes&#xD;
she was motionless, during which time the cloud had grad-&#xD;
ually disappeared from her countenance: she then abruptly&#xD;
went to Miss Leonard, and held out her hand, saying, "I&#xD;
should feel as you do under the circumstances! You are a&#xD;
true sister !"&#xD;
The coldness all vanished from the manner of Agnes:&#xD;
she took Miss Blake's hand with an appreciative smile, and&#xD;
pressed it, but she said nothing, and soon quitted the room.&#xD;
"Wasn't that prettily done; fellow-sinner ?" Diana ex-&#xD;
claimed with an instantaneous return to her usual manner,&#xD;
as she nodded at Amy.&#xD;
The latter colored deeply, and asked, "Why do you say&#xD;
fellow-sinner ?"&#xD;
Diana laughed a peal of infinite amusement: then she&#xD;

laid her hand over Amy's mouth with th~ word, "Hush !"&#xD;
erhphatically uttered, and seconded by her merry iook.&#xD;
"Do you know you read me a touching lecture the first&#xD;
morning I ever saw you? and don't you know there is an&#xD;
ocean of coquettish wickedness in our composition as well&#xD;
asInine? Forgive you-you cant help it! It's easier to&#xD;
preach than practice, isn't it ?"&#xD;
"A great de~U, Miss Blake !" returned Amy when power&#xD;
of speech was given her. "I know better than I do, still I&#xD;
think you mistake me a little. I would not go so far as to&#xD;
m~ke a person love me, if I did not mean to return it: I&#xD;
like to please but I would not excite, or trifle with deep feel-&#xD;
ing!"&#xD;
"Can you say to the tide, 'Stay!' when you have directed&#xD;
its course?" Diana spoke earnestly.&#xD;
A regretful feeling settled upoii the features of Amy; it&#xD;
rose up~ from her bt~tter soul* she grieved at the weak good&#xD;
that was so powerless within her: she saw th4 her, own cx-&#xD;

better," she said after her companion had stood looking at&#xD;
her, "let us try to make others better !"&#xD;
"How can I?" questioned Diana, whose quick heart&#xD;
seemed to catch the mood of her school-mate.&#xD;
Amy pointed with an entreating, doubting smile to the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
"It's of no use! it's my nature !"&#xD;
"Still do right this once! I'm not good, but I want to&#xD;
be !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'm dreadfully impulsive, Amy! I can't stay good more&#xD;
than an hour, but this is to please you !" she went to the&#xD;
window, closed it, and unrolled the curtain even to the sill,&#xD;
then she took the little bouquet that hung at her apron&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
A YOUNG physician sat in his office with an open volume be..&#xD;
fore him-it was a medical ~vork: once he had studied such&#xD;
books with ardent interest, but now '~ cares for the morrow"&#xD;
overshadowed him. He had selected his profession from a&#xD;
love of it ; he had weighed his powers, his proclivities, and&#xD;
his character, and had decided that nature, or rather God,&#xD;
had ordained him to minister to the suffering. He hoped to&#xD;
become well known and rich, but these were not hg first&#xD;
considerations; it was a peculiar delight to him to turn his&#xD;
love of science to a practical use; he had ~spent days in&#xD;
roaming through the country adjacent to New York collect-&#xD;
ing plants, and then days and even weeks were spent in his&#xD;
laboratory, which was in one corner of his office-to furnish&#xD;
this, he had fared and dressed in a manner that 'vould have&#xD;
cut a dandy to the quick, and yet he was a gentlemanly&#xD;
looking young man too; he supported a dog and a cat, not&#xD;
altogether to gratify his social interests but that he might&#xD;
try experiments upon them. During four years Ralph&#xD;
Kendrick had lived his lonely life, keeping up his hope&#xD;
&#xD;
amid bitter discouragements; he was now twenty-six, and&#xD;
he was scarcely a whit better off than he was the day that&#xD;
he had received his diploma: he had patients, quite a good&#xD;
many of them, but they were in the main poorer than him-&#xD;
self: the few of ample means never seemed to suppose his&#xD;
wages would l~e acceptable, and he hesitated ~o appear per-&#xD;
sistently in the character of a dinner lest he should lose&#xD;
practice. As to the greatly indigent, he thanked God that&#xD;
he did not quite live in vain, while he could instil health&#xD;
into their bodies and minds: the brightness of his simple&#xD;
career came in largest measure from the blessedness of&#xD;
giving~to those who had not so rich a field of enjoyment as&#xD;
himself-~--his gifts were time and skill, and they were&#xD;
treasures to one who valued their use, rather than their pos~&#xD;
session. His pleasures lay in books gained through great&#xD;
pecuniary straits-an occasional attendance upon the lecture&#xD;
of a gifted man-and a rai~nble in the country: he could&#xD;
not afford to go much into society, nor did his nature&#xD;
demand lighted evening parlors, and small talk;. upon a&#xD;
few well chosen friends, his heart would have cast all its&#xD;
social sunshine, but these he had not.&#xD;
Inasmuch as all people are subject to diverse states of&#xD;
feeling, Dr. Kendrick had his variations also: he was not&#xD;
always philosophical and calm, as careless observers might&#xD;
have supposed.&#xD;
As he sat alone in his office, the bright side of his life&#xD;
went down below the horizon; the driving September rain&#xD;
swept against his window panes, and darkened the grey sky&#xD;

more gloomy tint as he glanced towards it; the&#xD;
lirowni sh floor took a homeless aspect, so did the blue-&#xD;
painted wood-box, which had preserved its winter quarters&#xD;
for lack of' a better place to stow it: excessively hot weather&#xD;
had been succeeded by raw, chilly days-had his fuel been&#xD;
abundant, he might not have deemed a fire absolutely neces-&#xD;
sary, but as he h~td none, he eyed his little empty stove, as&#xD;
if it had been the enemy of his place----it looked of a bright&#xD;
rust colors where quondam fires had burned the lustre off;&#xD;
this disgusted him suddenly, for although he was neat in his&#xD;
person, with his books and papers, and chemicals, he was&#xD;
very helpless in the art of domestic embellishment. He&#xD;
was not in hi~ best mood; he closed his book with an&#xD;
emphatic bang, and walked the floor, exclaiming, "It is&#xD;
confoundedly annoying to live as I do! Look at ekety&#xD;
chair !" he contemplated it a moment, and then relieved him-&#xD;
self' by giving it a slight kick: he was not demonstrative&#xD;
mans or the force of his feelings would have sent it over and&#xD;
demolished it. He resumed his walk, and stopt at the&#xD;
other side of the office. "What a dismal, heaven-forsaken&#xD;
look the whole room has! carpetless! meagre and mean as&#xD;
the abode of a miser! What is the matter? Other men&#xD;
succeed? haven't I ability? am I lazy? or is the world at&#xD;
fault? Nd! that is too silly! I am willing to help my-&#xD;
self; does God never mean to help me? does He intend for-&#xD;
ever to thrust me into the traces, and goad me~ on in the&#xD;
same rough track? If I had trampled upon rhy better&#xD;
nature, and had set in full play all the artifice and acquisi-&#xD;

tiveness that is dowered to me, I should not now be looking&#xD;
upon this dreayy room perhaps! Ah well! My con-&#xD;
N&#xD;
science ~vill not permit m~ even now to wish I were a&#xD;
morally wors~ man, for the \sake of worldly prosperity. I&#xD;
should be no happier today} for having driven the necessi-&#xD;
tous into deeper po~'erty t~ pay me: we suffer together;&#xD;
they groan under the same lash; they must appear what&#xD;
they are not, as I must. Hark! there comes the man&#xD;
for the rent! I know his infernal rap! poor dog! it is his&#xD;
business !"&#xD;
Dr.. Kendrick opened the office 4oor, and bowed with a&#xD;
dignity that would have adorned a court; he looked well as&#xD;
he stood there confronting his visitor; his straight brow,&#xD;
well-cut lips, and very clear, dark eyes inspired trust. "My&#xD;
friend, you must call at another time !" he said with an ac-&#xD;
cent Qf decision, as if he were in the ascendant.&#xD;
"This is the fifth time I have called, sir! the rent has&#xD;
been due a month. I am very sorry you are so hard up, and&#xD;
I would make it easy for you, if I could, but I must look to&#xD;
head-quarters for approval, or I shall lose my agency. Mr.&#xD;
Second is strict about business-he lays down the rules, and&#xD;
I must follow 'em.\ lie said I must get another tenant if you&#xD;
did not pay to-day !"&#xD;
A deep scarlet rose in the young physician's cheek, but&#xD;
otherwise his reserved countenance did not alter;. his look&#xD;
did not remove itself from the agent's face: he was siknt a&#xD;
moment, and then he replied, "You must do your duty, sir,&#xD;
of course. I cannot pay you, but I will see Mr. Second my-&#xD;

self to..day: perhaps some arrangement can be made, so that&#xD;
I need not move."&#xD;
"Mr. Second don't like to be troubled about the business&#xD;
he delegates to me, sir! It isn't every tenant I'd be willing&#xD;
to have go to him, but If' you will, I suppose I can't help it."&#xD;
" You can't help it, sir !"&#xD;
The man left him, and he turned to his cheerless room&#xD;
with a darker look than he had yet worn. He had never&#xD;
spoken with 'Mr. Second, although he knew him quite well&#xD;
by sight; there was nothing in his looks indicative of a hard&#xD;
man, and he believed that he would accommodate him when&#xD;
he understood the real state of the case. He seized his hat&#xD;
and umbrella, and wended his way to th9 hotel where his&#xD;
landlord boarded: he was shown into a private parlor; after&#xD;
waiting until dinner was over, he had the satisfaction of wit~&#xD;
nessing the entrance of Mr. Second. ~r. Kendrick proceed-&#xD;
ed at once to speak of' his business, after stating his name.&#xD;
"I was told by your agent this morning, sir, that he had&#xD;
orders to get a new tenant for the office I occupy, provided I&#xD;
did not pay to-day. I have r~o money at present."&#xD;
"How long has the rent been due~ sir ~" inquired Mr.&#xD;
Scored.&#xD;
"About a month !"&#xD;
"We are obliged to have regular rules in these matters,&#xD;
sir, and rules are of no avail unless tl~ey are enforced. I&#xD;
don't like to put you to inconvenience, but cannot see&#xD;
how your ease can be an exception. You have some prac.&#xD;
tice ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Certainly! I have enough due me to live free from&#xD;
debt, if I could get it; my income would keep off starva-&#xD;
tion. I hope to pay you soon, sir, if I partially relinquish&#xD;
my profession to do it. It depends upon you, sir, to give&#xD;
me the fruits of studious years;. if you press me now, I&#xD;
may be obliged to sacrifice, everything to earn a mere sub-&#xD;
sistence. If you will wait, you shall not be a loser."&#xD;
"I might wait a long time. It's hard for you, doctor, but&#xD;
in justice to myself I am obliged to demand the rent or the&#xD;
office."&#xD;
A dead silence followed this unexpected' remark; Mr.&#xD;
Second experienced an uneasy sensation of pity, but he had&#xD;
so long schooled himself to follow his judgment in matters&#xD;
of business, that corn passion always glided away from his&#xD;
thoughts in a subdued condition: his judgment invariably&#xD;
demanded temporal, and not moral success. Dr. Kendrick&#xD;
took up his hat, which he had placed upon a table, with&#xD;
firmly-set lips; "You shall have the office to-morrow, Mr.&#xD;
Second !" he responded, with his clear look upon the rich&#xD;
man's face; he felt that he was the superior person, and the&#xD;
feeling penetrated to the landlord's consciousness-.he did&#xD;
not like Dr. Kendrick from that moment.&#xD;
"Money !" soliloquised the doctor fiercely, as he went to-&#xD;
ward home. "What an advantage it gives one man over&#xD;
another; here I stand in the universe endo'ved with gifts&#xD;
equal to that man's, and he is my tyrant! here I stand over-&#xD;
flowing with the desire to do some great, good work for my&#xD;
fellow cr~atures-l thirst to be generous, and I must bQ&#xD;

mean even to my washerwoman : I must put back the hand&#xD;
that appeals to inc-I must turn from the supplicating faces&#xD;
that are pinched with hunger, and: such I meet every day in&#xD;
my rounds. Meanwhile the rich man's heel grinds upon hi~&#xD;
brother's neck. Ah! rich man! you have done me no&#xD;
harn~! you have aroused me! you have struck out the "I&#xD;
will!" from the depths of my spirit. I will live and die in&#xD;
my profession-the evil one shall not tempt me to abandon&#xD;
it in this my hour of extremity. I vegetate in a circle so&#xD;
narro~v that I cannot draw a free breath. 0, the sun is&#xD;
shining, is it? and I've got my umbrella up! And here's&#xD;
the alley where. that poor wretch lives who broke his leg the&#xD;
.other day and who never will be able to pay mc :-J must&#xD;
see to him, or he may die for want of care, while I'm taking&#xD;
care of myself." The doctor went up the alley, and into a&#xD;
dilapidated house, where his presence ~vas sunshine to a&#xD;
numerous family; he spent a half hour over his patient,&#xD;
stroked a flaxen head or two, said an encouraging word to&#xD;
the anxious wife with his rare, illumining smile, and to an&#xD;
old woman on the hearth, he rern~mrked, "Your eyesight&#xD;
must be pretty good, grand~rnother, to enable you to mend&#xD;
those stockings." All these little common-place things were&#xD;
not costly, and yet they settled rainbow-like over the hearts&#xD;
of the poor~ family, for they sprang from human kindness-&#xD;
and their mission did not ~nd with the recipients: the rain-&#xD;
bow spanned the doctor's heart also; the clouds rolled a~ray,&#xD;
and the ~un of trust shone do~vn upon him: when he fc~und&#xD;
himself on the street, he perceived that the panorama of~ his&#xD;
&#xD;
existence had undergone a changQ; he thought of the same&#xD;
things in a different light: after steering his course toward&#xD;
a reading room, he began a new soliloquy. "One aiway s&#xD;
has a very crooked vision, when in a passion with his fate.&#xD;
Poverty has certainly laden me with blessings: it has made&#xD;
me more sympathising ~and considerate; it has sharpened&#xD;
my wits to see if there were no gifts beside those which&#xD;
wealth can bestow; it has caused me to test the exceeding&#xD;
value of kind tones and words and deeds: they are magical&#xD;
in their effect. This moi~ning I could have sworn unmiti-&#xD;
gatedly, if I had given the rein to my wishes, and now I&#xD;
seem to see everything disposed with a certain tendency to&#xD;
harmony. The agent called, and driving me to desperation,&#xD;
I went to see the landlord: the first appearance to an un-&#xD;
philosophical mind would be that I had a fruitless visit-~--but&#xD;
just the contrary; a crowd of beneficial results fallow. flis&#xD;
hardness deepens in my breast a determination to exercise&#xD;
greater charity toward the suffering: it shows me the power&#xD;
one person has of imparting pain or pleasure by a few words&#xD;
and an accompanying tone and manner. I passed the alley&#xD;
on my way home--I 'should not have gone there but for the&#xD;
visit--I was solicitous to cheer the family under the influ-&#xD;
ence of my mental investigations, and I saw the bright looks&#xD;
that I desired to call out-they were in reality worth more&#xD;
than Secord's thousands of silver-figuratively speaking,&#xD;
perhaps I had better say. if he had been lenient, I should not&#xD;
have bestirred myself to look up some light work to fill my&#xD;
hours aside from my piofessio~-as it is, I shall pitch into&#xD;

something with the spirit of John Adams. "Sink or Swim!&#xD;
live or die! survive or perish, I am for bread and butters&#xD;
and rent and money." The doctor wound up his mental&#xD;
remarks as he reached the reading..room; he looked over&#xD;
many papers, and found some advertisements of rooms to&#xD;
let, and one that desired writing done. He copied them in&#xD;
his mind, for he had a good memory, and set forth upon his&#xD;
walk again: the writing he obtained, then he went to two of&#xD;
his influential patrons, and obtained, reference as to his hon-&#xD;
esty; with these he secured him a new office. Before night&#xD;
he had removed all his effects from his old home, with the&#xD;
aid of ~wo Irishmen whom he had gratuitously attended.&#xD;
His shingle was hung out. When evening came, he sat&#xD;
once more alone; his chair was tipped back, and his boots&#xD;
rested on the edge of the table; it wanted yet a few&#xD;
moments to his usual hour of lighting up: as he surveyed a&#xD;
pile of papers to be copied, and reviewed the incidents of the&#xD;
day, and of many previous days, in his usual dissecting&#xD;
style, he half audiiAy murmured:&#xD;
"How can a man doubt that there is a Divine Providence&#xD;
over him, disposing both the good and evil of his fellows to&#xD;
his actual advantage, if he will seek out the behests of cii'-&#xD;
cumstance ?" how long or how wisely the lonely doctor&#xD;
xnighf have meditated ~annot be known, for through the&#xD;
twilight and the glass Window in his door, he saw a well&#xD;
dressed gentle~nan preparing o to meet him. "This is&#xD;
probably a superior locality for ~my business !" he thought&#xD;
as he arose to meet his expected patient: he opened the&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
door, and greeted him with the quiet reserve of manner&#xD;
which was peculiar to hin~i, and attractive because one&#xD;
naturally supposed from his countenance that beauty of&#xD;
character lay behind it. The stranger desired him to accom&#xD;
pany him in baste, as a lady had fainted, and had been&#xD;
carried into a store; as the two entered upon tl~e street, the&#xD;
doctor asked two or three questions about the lady's illness,&#xD;
and then relapsed into silence; his companion directed&#xD;
rather interested observations to his countenance when they&#xD;
passed a brilliantly lighted store, or a street lamp. The&#xD;
ady was soon in a condition- to ride home, and as the.&#xD;
l~tranger was only one among several who had cared for her&#xD;
he resigi~ed her to others, and when Dr. Kendrick took leave,&#xD;
he stept out of the store also, saying frankly, "I go your&#xD;
way, doctor; I~lI walk with you as far as your office, if it is&#xD;
agreeable."&#xD;
Qertainly, sir !" responded the doctor smiling, and offer-&#xD;
ing his hand. They fell into conversation quickly, as intelli-&#xD;
gent and thoughtful men are apt to do when they meet one&#xD;
whom they suppose can understand their cast of mind.&#xD;
"Will you spend an hour in my den, sir V' asked the&#xD;
physician, as they reached his office.&#xD;
Not to-night, sir. I thank you! I will do myself the&#xD;
pleasure of calling at another time !" with these wordg, the&#xD;
stranger handed his card to the doctor. ~' Marcus Leonard"&#xD;
was engraved upon it. They shook hands heartily, and&#xD;
parted. The one was wealthy and gifted, fitted to shine in&#xD;
society, or to enloy solitude. The other was such as we&#xD;

to accompany her home, although they were very neain&#xD;

swept to her face, then it retreated again to her stunned&#xD;
heart: she looked downward !-she was helpless! She had&#xD;
called him father in her thoi~ght: he bare no likeness to the&#xD;
glorious lover of her fancy.&#xD;
"Amy, would you like to be my wife ?" The words were&#xD;
terrible to her. She walked beside him, speechlessly, h~r&#xD;
nerveless arm dropping its hold upon his.&#xD;
"You are very much surprised, Amy 1',&#xD;
Ii'&#xD;
"Yes, sir !" she faltered with great difficulty, as her head&#xD;
drooped low.&#xD;
"1 have loved you from the first, Amy I"&#xD;
"May 1 go, sir !" she lifted a frightened look to him. He&#xD;
replaced her hand upon his arm, and pressed it down as if&#xD;
to strengthen her.&#xD;
"You are agitated now! walk with me slowly. I would&#xD;
only have you think of this! your happen ss is mine!" he:&#xD;
iI~          threw himself upon her generosity, and  he stroke went&#xD;
deeper. With a beseeching look, she drew her hand away,&#xD;
and hurried on alone: she turned the first orner, and then&#xD;
with a vague fear that he might overtake h r, she fled ~s if&#xD;
for life, gasping, panting like a hunted gazell she was cone&#xD;
[41           scious only of misery when she entered he home. From&#xD;
Iii           her benefactor's increased kindness and care, she had been&#xD;
led to believe that she and Bel would become the daughters&#xD;
of his heart, and the shares of his luxury; he had intimated&#xD;
that it would be a joy to share his wealth with them. But&#xD;
the price! the price she was expected to pay.&#xD;
111             "What is it, Amy ?" cried Isabel coming in from school,&#xD;
&#xD;
and tossing her bo~inet on the sofa hastily, as she approached&#xD;
her sister's chair.&#xD;
"0, it is too dreadful! Oh! if I should come to it! oh,&#xD;
if I must come to it !"&#xD;
Bel fell on her knees beside her, and took hold of her two&#xD;
hands with a look of startled entreaty. Amy tore away her&#xD;
hands as if she could bear nothing in her present state, and&#xD;
then with a burst of tears, she laid them on Bel's shoulders,&#xD;
and groaned, "Mr. Second wants me to be his wife."&#xD;
"Gracious !" the child turned quite pale, "he's old enough&#xD;
to be your father !"&#xD;
"He's twenty-three years older than I am 1"&#xD;
"What did you say ?"&#xD;
"I don't know! I broke away! I wished the world&#xD;
would roll between him and me, so that I might never see&#xD;
him again; a revulsion of feeling overwhelmed me: it was&#xD;
so dreadful to know that he was selfish in his kindness to&#xD;
us, when I thought he was the best man that glorified the&#xD;
earth-he was buying me, and oh, my God! I am bought !"&#xD;
she started to her feet, and walked the floor awhile, then with&#xD;
a very bitter~ smile, she said, "I have said I would kneel&#xD;
phere, so that I might be bathed in the very glory of God.&#xD;
only to love supreme! I have had such dreams of a won-&#xD;
drous heart that would take me to itself, and shield me from&#xD;
all hard things, while it would lift me up into a purer atmos.&#xD;
thought I should be so happy-that I should some day&#xD;
strong friend to help me to be good. But he! would&#xD;
take~mne if he knew how I felt !"&#xD;

"I don't believe he would, Amy. You are not going to&#xD;
marry ~im! You never, never shall, if it1 makes you so un~&#xD;
happy!' Bel pressed her sister's face close to her own, and&#xD;
dropt tears upon it, continuing brokenly. "We have energy&#xD;
we have health! we can work !" she paused here, and with&#xD;
trouVled brow confronted the idea of poverty and toil,&#xD;
wondering if they could still look upon Mr. Second as a&#xD;
father and guardian if Amy refused him. "lie is so be-&#xD;
nevolent: you have often said he found his happiness in&#xD;
doing good. Would he wholly cast ~ cii; ~f "&#xD;
"0, Bel, there is another sword to threaten me !" cried&#xD;
Amy starting up. "If I refuse Mr~ Secord, do you suppose&#xD;
I would be the object of his charity ?" A new conflict&#xD;
arose in Amy's spirit; it was more fearful than th~ first:&#xD;
that was pitiful, for it displaced her ideal lover, and&#xD;
gave her a middle-aged parent in his stead: the suddenness&#xD;
of the revulsion swept away her former footing, but only&#xD;
transitoyily: at bottom she. had a liking, a partiality for her&#xD;
guardian: when Bel's words suggested the alternative of&#xD;
accepting him or leaving him, every gentle deed and look&#xD;
of his came before her, and upbraided her: closely knitted&#xD;
to this feeling was another, that revealed to her all the weak-&#xD;
ness and selfishness that had slum bered in her being. She&#xD;
could z~ot get away from the thought that glared at her per&#xD;
tinacioi~sly: Mr. Scored's wealth would save her from effort&#xD;
and la}~or twid that motive ranged itself beside griititude to&#xD;
him: then with h~r lay the power to keep Bel in luxury or&#xD;
to thrust her into poverty.&#xD;
&#xD;
Amy went into tl~e next room that she might be alone&#xD;
while the contending forces battled for mastery: she had an&#xD;
inward sense that it would be the nobler course~ to go back&#xD;
to the old life, but instantly there came upon this sense the&#xD;
words, "0 how can I seem ungrateful, and leave him soli-&#xD;
tary and unhappy '?"&#xD;
The "I will" uttered itself as it had done a dozen times&#xD;
against the "I will not." She believed that she was decided,&#xD;
and hoping to push away the subject, she took up a book.&#xD;
11cr eye fell upon a passionate sonnet of Mrs. Browning's,&#xD;
which smote her with an agony of' longing for such love:&#xD;
the cry and protest burst from her heart wildly: but&#xD;
strong as her emotions were, she fell woman-like into the&#xD;
groove ma~le by another's will: it had been her habit to&#xD;
obey Mr. Secord~s slightest wish, because she was grateful&#xD;
not because she was docile: it had always seemed to her a&#xD;
paramount duty and pleasure: she had often playfully&#xD;
acceded to his suggestions, and had seemed lightly to think&#xD;
of them, that he might not see th~ principle of obedience&#xD;
that governed her, and thus feel free to demand an$rthing.&#xD;
This had been wi.tI~x Amy an intuition rather than a plan&#xD;
of action. A new insight into his character had come to&#xD;
her: she felt his iron determination: time, and circum-&#xD;
stance and trial had not sounded the depths of her&#xD;
own character: she knew not what she was worth, or of&#xD;
what she was capable: she had not put off the child-&#xD;
like habit of dependence in thought and action thpse&#xD;
who were older, seemed wiser: actual contact and friction&#xD;

often open the. eyes that were veiled. A certain precocity&#xD;
of intellect and feeling sometimes forerun strength of char-&#xD;
acter, without indicating it: this precocity is not incoiisist-&#xD;
ent with a great measure of ignorance and weakness. The&#xD;
comparative ease of her present life, and the class of young&#xD;
girls whom she met at school had a tendency to make her&#xD;
over-rate the value of' style and position: her nature was&#xD;
not by any means as large as it was capable of bQcoming:&#xD;
she took a small measure of spiritual reaches and outgrowths&#xD;
and saw far more clearly narrow distances: she was too&#xD;
limited as yet to walk in a wide path, therefore she did not.&#xD;
Yet the prison learning of her soul made its moan, as she&#xD;
sighed, "He asks me never to look into the eyes of my&#xD;
ideal: he asks me to resign the dream of meeting a wholly&#xD;
congenial heart, I have expected utter gladness: thei~e was a&#xD;
blessed river of hope in my being that sent forth tides of&#xD;
life! I see it now, but the river is dry! this is why people&#xD;
laugh at dreams: they know how it will end. 1 ant told&#xD;
that love-matches after a few years are rarely as happy as&#xD;
those founded 'n judgme~it! Judgment! I hate the word!&#xD;
O George! would to heaven I had married you! I turned&#xD;
from you unsatisfied, and yet I shall fall into the hands of&#xD;
one who satisfied~ me less. Shall I love Mr. Scored as well&#xD;
when I have known him as long? Wives, who seem very&#xD;
happy often say they did not love their husbands when&#xD;
affection was first solicited. I shall love him more, shall I&#xD;
not ?" she looked up prayingly, as if God would 'deliver ~er~&#xD;
from a fatal error. Ab me! God does not always do this:&#xD;

&#xD;
He allows our weaknesses to work out their own cure. She&#xD;
went on, "It seems as if Mr. Second loves me because he&#xD;
thinks I may be ornamental: he has often spoken of my&#xD;
beauty: George never did, and yet I felt that 1 was a de-&#xD;
light to hint. Jn my simplicity I expected my life would&#xD;
bloom under a rarer heaven than his love arched over me:&#xD;
if I had not looked for measureless happiness, deeper than&#xD;
that which wealth can give, I might deem myself fortunate.&#xD;
I like splendor, but I thought of it as the frame to a glorious&#xD;
heart-picture." She dreamed a moment of this picture, then&#xD;
resolutely banishing it, ~he said; "Mr. Second is a good man:&#xD;
a xvise man: perhaps I need just such an one to guide me:&#xD;
I think I have the heart to do good, and he will give me the&#xD;
means. Should I forget this thought of rebeving suffering,&#xD;
may my right hand forget its cunning !" A vague fear that&#xD;
a sordid reason might preponderate and soil- other motives,&#xD;
made her cleave to the idea of atonement.&#xD;
The next day she sat alone and idle in her chair, with a&#xD;
marble pallor on her face:. she still swayed between rejec-&#xD;
tion and acceptance: when the street bell rang, a flush rose,&#xD;
lest Mr. Second sought her, and then it died away. It was&#xD;
a letter frm him; after the bearer of it had disappeared,&#xD;
she held it in her hands, looking at it, not daring to break&#xD;
the seal, knowing that her destiny hung upon its words: it&#xD;
dropt upor~ the floor, and lay there, while she prayed feebly&#xD;
and received neither light nor strength.&#xD;
"Well, the matter must be decided in some way! all the&#xD;
wishes in the world will not ~et me out of this position.'&#xD;

She picked up the letter, tore it open and read,-.~-&#xD;
"DEAR A~r,-J did not say all to you that I wished&#xD;
yesterday, as you were SO startled-a very natural conse-&#xD;

have watchedd you long, loving you better every day, and&#xD;
feeling as if you of all the womeI~ in the world, are suited&#xD;
to my peculiar character and disposition. I have passed by&#xD;
women both rich and beautiful, to fix my heart upon the&#xD;
violet that bloomed in my path. I will devote my life to&#xD;
your happiness! Although you ~viclent1y had not thought&#xD;
of me as a lover, yet I h~ve seen trust and affection in your&#xD;
looks. If you do not yet love me, as you will upon a clearer&#xD;
understanding of my id~latry for you, you will wholly re-&#xD;
turn my feelings in time. I have long sought happiness, but&#xD;
it has eluded me! you alone can give me the boon! You&#xD;
will not withhold it, will you, dear, dear Amy '~ 1 shall ex-&#xD;
pect an answer from you by this afternoon's post-an an-&#xD;
swer of some kind-a line, if nothing more. blind that I&#xD;
am not patient now that I have revealed to you my affection.&#xD;
I look with assurance for a favorable reply.&#xD;
Your devoted lover,&#xD;
JtX5Tfl~&#xD;
She arose impulsively, and procuring pen, paper and ink,&#xD;
wrote:&#xD;
"Mi- BENEFACTOR~-'~ I was greatly startled by your words&#xD;
yesterday, as you say. You must know my heait before&#xD;
&#xD;
you seek such a possession. I honored you! I loved you as&#xD;
my adopted father! 'I looked up to you, but I had no feelii4~&#xD;
that should belong to a betrothed wife-I, have not now ! 1~&#xD;
have loved another better, I still love him better. I rejected&#xD;
him, because there were points in our characters where we&#xD;
should have disagreed. Every one of your acts of kindness&#xD;
is burned imperishably upon my heart, could I repay them&#xD;
by making you happy, I would do so, but I sadly fear, kind&#xD;
friend, that I would not be the companion you would hope&#xD;
to find in me. You have seen me when I was gay and&#xD;
trffling, pleased with everything-but I am passionate,&#xD;
quick in temper, and can imagine that in the trials of life I&#xD;
should not be found a cheerful console. I am so young, to&#xD;
think of marriage! last month I was eighteen. I have now&#xD;
told you my thoughts !-4 caflnot xvithhcdd the poverty'&#xD;

"AMY."&#xD;
She directed and sealed her letter, then, throwing on her&#xD;
bonnet, she carried it to the nearest post-office: when she&#xD;
returned, she cast herself on the floor; after vehement&#xD;
weeping, she fell asleep, which she had not done the night&#xD;
*&#xD;
before. At sunset, Mr. Scored's second letter came; the&#xD;
sisters sat together when it was handed to them. It read&#xD;
thus:&#xD;
"DEAREST AMY,-YOU can well imagine that your letter&#xD;
wounded me deeply. I had little thought that the heart&#xD;

out you. Tomorrow, I shall come to see you: perhaps at~&#xD;
twelve o'clock. Ah! Amy, love me a little--my affection&#xD;
muit and will win a fond return.&#xD;
'~ Your devoted lover,&#xD;
"JUSTIN SCORED."&#xD;
The girl then lifted her white face and looked from the&#xD;
window with a half bitter smile. "You see how it is 1" she&#xD;
said to Isabel, "he loves me madly, a very suitable word !"&#xD;
the smile died away, and the whiteness turned to an a shy&#xD;
hide about her lips: BeT rose affrighteU, as her head sank&#xD;
back against the window frame, and her eyes closed;~ her&#xD;
breath came gaspingly; she could not speak or move as a&#xD;
lethargy stole over her, but she was not unconscious: a dash'&#xD;
of water, and fresh air after a while revived her. This&#xD;
physical illness seemed in a measure to subdue the anguish&#xD;
that had possessed her;' it removed the bitter feeling that&#xD;
had turned her life to gall: she saw that her fate was decid-&#xD;
ed, that her romantic dreams were swept away without the&#xD;
&#xD;
prospect of a realization, and she called upon all that was&#xD;
wise within her to embellish her sacrifice. For an hour or&#xD;
two she sat in utter silence, with her head leaning back on&#xD;
the rocking chair which Bel had brought for her; the 5oung&#xD;
sister only held her hand, and glanced at her quiet face oc-&#xD;
casionally. At length, Amy exclaimed, taking Isabel's hand&#xD;
in both her own, "Bow hot you are, Bel! your hand is&#xD;
like fire! Are you sick V'&#xD;
"I guess not !" Isabel returned in an evasive manner.&#xD;
"My head aches a little 1"&#xD;
"You have been waiting on me, dear, and I never thought&#xD;
you needed my care."&#xD;
"I'll be well enough in the morning, Amy 'if you'd only&#xD;
be happy as you were before, I should be so glad. I don't&#xD;
want you to marry Mr. Second, if it will change you so."&#xD;
After a moment, she said, "I'll, take a little nap! I don't&#xD;
want anything to eat." She went to the sofa, where Amy ar-&#xD;
ranged the pillows for her, and then took a seat beside her,&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
"Bel! don't trouble yourself about me! you know I&#xD;
don't' take things to heart much except for a little while. I&#xD;
couldn't get a kinder husband then Mr. Second if I were to&#xD;
search the world over. I was very cruel and ungrateful to&#xD;
him in my thoughts yesterday~L~~and to.day. People can&#xD;
make themselves miserable if they try-I am going to look&#xD;
on the bright side. We shall have a beautiful home, and it&#xD;
will be a joy to see you coming in my boudoir !'~ she&#xD;
smiled for the blue eyes that so earnestly regarded her:&#xD;

&#xD;
they were~ satisfied, and closed theni in sleep. The watcher&#xD;
turned her chair slightly aside to conceal her face; once&#xD;
more she laid her had back, but this time slow tears rolled&#xD;
over her cheek, one after another-one after another! She&#xD;
uttered "George !" with such an appealing spiritual cry,&#xD;
she half believed it must reach him, and bring him to her&#xD;
sight. She had no right to think of him now: she must be&#xD;
an honest betrbthed wife as far as she could control herself.&#xD;
She left her chair' and by the fading twilight gathered out of&#xD;
the table drawer a few notes, poems and withered flowers:&#xD;
it was her imp~ilse to clasp them to her heart, but she laid&#xD;
them on4he ta1~le, and lighted a lamp. Then she took them&#xD;
to the little sto ~e, but ere she dropt them in, she did hastily&#xD;
press them to l~er lips, mentally saying, "They are the last&#xD;
records of my joy! how little I dreamed when I so wantonly&#xD;
cast that love away, that the world was not full of it-I&#xD;
asked for more, and I have met with less."&#xD;
She consumed her treasures, lighting them by the flame of&#xD;
the lamp: and~ during the dreary evening she sat and&#xD;
thought-.--and asked herself~ if she had acted rightly: she did&#xD;
not know! ~he was young and had no counsellor.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
"THE fact is, I hate to take a bird's-eye view of the condi-&#xD;
tion of my heart-my mind I won't consider at all, for it&#xD;
has been of small account for a few months past," said&#xD;
Marcus Leonard to himself; as he contemplated a daguerre-&#xD;
otype of Miss Blake, which he had stolen from her moth-&#xD;
er's parlor table, and put in his vest pocket before the young&#xD;
lady's eyes,~-meeting with no rebuke for the act; only a&#xD;
blush. "It is remarkable how a man's whole nature can&#xD;
change under such an experience-how his steadily pursued&#xD;
aims can grow insipid-how the scientific discoveries in the&#xD;
papers can grow trifling-4he minister in the pulpit can be-&#xD;
come tame, the lawyer at court dull in his most fiery&#xD;
speech. I look at uncle Harrington, in his counting room!&#xD;
-he thinks he is engaged in important business: to me the&#xD;
loss or gain of thousands seems less moving than the arch-&#xD;
smile of Diana! A year ago I was deep in the classics-I&#xD;
was deep in scientific studies-no thought gave my life&#xD;
such a start as the hope of entering deeply, ifito the arcan~&#xD;
of the universe. I thanked God that there was no bottom&#xD;

much to 'say to her, and now that thought is rapid, burning&#xD;
and poetic I cannot communicate with her; she has no wor-&#xD;

But now moral and intellectual vigor are swallowed up in&#xD;
my infatuation for Diana-'-.iufatuation! that is the word, for&#xD;
I still have a little 'reason sitting coldly on the top of my&#xD;
head, overlooking the fireworks of feeling. She fascinates&#xD;
me-she would not help me and elevate me as the ideal wo.&#xD;
man of my choice would-I would point out the glories of'&#xD;
the earth to my beloved; I would have her represent to me&#xD;
the loveliness of heaven-would have her otiide me by her&#xD;
intuitions into the intricacies of the soul-world within her-&#xD;
self and others. Diana has no religious tendencies; nature&#xD;
has not made them strong with me, but they are very valu-&#xD;
able-.--! would lay down all I possess rather than have my&#xD;
&#xD;
spiritual nature blunted or disused." The young man walk-&#xD;
ed the floor of his study uneasily-it was a large room, and&#xD;
served also as a bed-chamber: after pacing up and down&#xD;
awhile, he looked at the likeness; it smiled at him, and re~-&#xD;
gained flr its original unlimited power. lie took his hat&#xD;
and went to the house of Mrs. Blake. Diana was more irre-&#xD;
sistable than ever, and they exchanged betrothal rings that&#xD;
evening.&#xD;
A few weeks passed away, during which Mr. Leonard was&#xD;
in a perfectly satisfied cQndition; much of the time he was&#xD;
engaged in pitying the rest of the world: a humdrum&#xD;
phase characterized all people's lives save his own, and&#xD;
Diana's. But his pity soon returned upon himself, for with&#xD;
all Diana's love for him, he saw that she was not quite Will-&#xD;
ing to give up her former admirers: he turned away from&#xD;
the conviction that he could not trust his loved one, for it&#xD;
came upon him perpetually. Not that she was intentionally&#xD;
unworthy of trust, not that one' thought of Leonard's was&#xD;
not more dear than an ocean of ideas from another, but it&#xD;
was in her nature to hunger with an insatiable longing to&#xD;
sway the hearts that loved her; it was a brief satisfaction&#xD;
to see the suddenly fiery eye, paling cheek, or trembling lip&#xD;
of a worshipper: she could be self-forgetting, noble and de-&#xD;
voted in all but this; her impulses led her to magnanimous&#xD;
acts but not in this 'shape: only the deepest religious&#xD;
principle could make her consistently merciful to suitors,&#xD;
and that she had not. Her lover understood her; he saw'&#xD;
his place in the temple of her heart, but it was bitter to&#xD;

&#xD;
his proud soul to realize that he was not sufficient for her,&#xD;
as she Was for him. One evening after he had left her, he&#xD;
walked the street f6r hours musing upon their two characters.&#xD;
lie s~w that his love was weakness in the strength of its&#xD;
tyranny over him ;~ it had from the first pleaded against his&#xD;
judgment: it had brought her girlish figure before him&#xD;
with the arch smile that he loved, and with the eyes that&#xD;
interpreted her sweeter self: it had robed her faults in a&#xD;
draper~r so seducing and airy, that they took the form of&#xD;
bewitchments: with his intellect he apprehended that they&#xD;
might bring anxiety in iJie future, yet he hoped that for him&#xD;
they would be subdued, and then Diana would be more&#xD;
'~~recious than ever. He had not mentioned his engagement&#xD;
to his sister, feeling instinctively that she would regret it:&#xD;
as he chafed under his jealous pangs, he wished that he had&#xD;
talked with her freely before he was bound~-had looked&#xD;
with her clear eyes upon Diana, rather than his own.&#xD;
His next visit to his betrothed awakened no slumbering&#xD;
fears: she had been grieved that day, and it made her&#xD;
doubly thoughtful and kind. Marcus had dropped in to see&#xD;
her on his return from his uncle's eoun.ting-room: he left&#xD;
her full of hope, at peace with all the world. lie was ready&#xD;
now to disclose his engagement to Agnes; he was not there-&#xD;
fore disappointed when he heard her gentle tap upon his&#xD;
door a moment after he had entered his room.&#xD;
"Come in !" he ca]le~1 out, as he xyas raising a window-&#xD;
shade to admit the western sunshine.&#xD;
She entered without a smile, and advancing to his escri-&#xD;
&#xD;
toir, stood leatilug against it, until he handed her a chair,&#xD;
and took one himself; with the words, "Sit down, Agnes!&#xD;
why do you look so serious '?"&#xD;
"I have heard some news to-day that surprises me, Mar-&#xD;
cus !" she said, looking steadily at him. "1 came to ask if&#xD;
it were true-are you engaged to Diana Blake ?"&#xD;
J' I am!" lie answered,~coloring ~ little, and closing his&#xD;
lips after he had spoken with a cha r~acteristic expression of&#xD;
firmness; it likened him to his sister, although the expres-&#xD;
sion was habitual to her, and occasional with him* she&#xD;
had never moved him from a purpose after she had thus&#xD;
seen his lips close together: she sat ~ilentIy thinking what to&#xD;
say, until he said, "Who told you&#xD;
"Diana herself."&#xD;
"At school to-day ?"&#xD;
"Yes 1"&#xD;
"Was she surprised that I had not told you myself?"&#xD;
"No! she knows how I regard her 1" Agmes lifted her&#xD;
eyes, and looked at her brother.&#xD;
"What do you think of it, Agnes ?" he observed her&#xD;
keenly as he put the question.&#xD;
"I am very sorry, Marcus 1"&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"I have heard you speak of &amp;amp;rngeniality of aim and&#xD;
character as requisite to a happy m rriage."&#xD;
" Well ?"&#xD;
"Are Diana's aims yours, Marcu ?"&#xD;
"They may become so! she has glorious nature !"&#xD;

"Did she ever cast upon the elevation of the race an&#xD;
earnest thought ~ can she sympathise with you in this&#xD;
respect ?"&#xD;
"Agnes! I find there has been .a vast deal of humbug&#xD;
about me !"&#xD;
"Marcus! you are changed! H~ve you forgotten all we&#xD;
used to talk about in our twilight walks ?" her self-posses-&#xD;
sion gave way, and she burst into tears-it was very bitter&#xD;
to see that her brother's spirit had gone from hers-he had&#xD;
carried his brightness to another; his inmost heart was not&#xD;
open to her, and if it were, it would only grieve her.&#xD;
He supported his forehead upon h~s hand as he sat by the&#xD;
escrituir. and the shadows of thought swept over his grave,&#xD;
flushed face; he sat with his eyes b~t upon the floor while&#xD;
Agnes wept: when she ceased, ~e took her hand gently, and&#xD;
spoke in a low tone. "I have not forgotten my better aims,&#xD;
Agnes! I have not forgotten our blessed twilight walks.&#xD;
You forget'that Diana may in~prove through my ardent&#xD;
love for heF: she is to be my wife-she has my affection--&#xD;
my passionate affection. I acknowledge that she is not the&#xD;
woman whom I once described as my imaginary wife, but&#xD;
now I would turn from that picture ~o clasp Diana-.--.I&#xD;
prefer the real object of my love."&#xD;
"Because you clothe her with the halo that belongs to&#xD;
your ideal-you see her through it, but when close intimacy&#xD;
shows her as she is, she will pain you !"&#xD;
"Stop, Agnes !" he said rising and walking the floor as&#xD;
her spoken arrow pierced him: it was too keen when flying&#xD;
&#xD;
from ~another hand than hi~ own: after a few moments, he&#xD;
returned to a gentler voice. "People rarely act as they&#xD;
think tney will in a given case. You do not see all that is&#xD;
noblest and best in Diana~!"&#xD;
"Perhaps not 1"&#xD;
"She is a young creature of eighteen; a school-girl&#xD;
still !"&#xD;
"She has a strong character; many girls do not show&#xD;
what they will b~ when so young: she does."&#xD;
"Do yott fore-see that the merriment of her nature will&#xD;
never be subdued ~o, riper virtue ?" asked Marcus with a&#xD;
little sarcasm in his tone.&#xD;
"I see that she and I are eighteen, and that we are very&#xD;
different."&#xD;
This was another arrow, and he paced the room a long&#xD;
time without speaking: at last when tender feelings gained&#xD;
the ascendancy he went behind his sister's chair, and bending&#xD;
over, kissed her forehead. "Agnes! you are the best sister&#xD;
a brother ever had! I wish that I could have satisfied you&#xD;
K&#xD;
in my choice--I wish that we could have walked along hand&#xD;
in hand in regard to our mental experiences, so that nothing&#xD;
could have stept between us-but this is our fate-we are&#xD;
acted upon by circumstance, or by providence. Of what use&#xD;
is it to talk of the impossible? resign yoursel~C to this en-&#xD;
gagement. If at some future time, you should disappoint&#xD;
me in your choice, I will try to have charity for you-I will&#xD;
try to recognize the feelings that will act as a necessity upon&#xD;
you. There are few as young as we are, who have thought&#xD;

&#xD;
over the problems of life so seriously-do not regret that 1&#xD;
may be the meais of causing Diana to think, feel and act&#xD;
differently from what she has been taught."&#xD;
"1 should not regret that: You know that I desire her&#xD;
real good, and if it can be promoted by you, I will believe&#xD;
that it is best she should be my sister-our interests must&#xD;
not be divided, dear Marcus. Diana and I are good friends:&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE day after Amy received the letter which bound her to&#xD;
Mr. Scored, Bel arose and declared herself 'veIl enough to&#xD;
go to school: her wish was not opposed, for Amy was anx-&#xD;
ious to be alone: out of the thousand blessings she had de-&#xD;
sired in times past, she selected one to pray for-she had&#xD;
no speech nor language" for any tither-it was resigna~&#xD;
tion: and one who looked upon her haggard face, upon the&#xD;
dark circle around her eyes, and upon the compression of her&#xD;
flexible lips would have seen that the spirit would have de-&#xD;
voured the body slowly but surely, unless it came. She&#xD;
was in the habit of prayer, but never before had she prayed&#xD;
i1 such abandonment; every faculty of her being sent out a&#xD;
cry for resignation,-a cry for light! It is a fearful hour&#xD;
when the fabric of hope first gives way completely-when&#xD;
the splendor of life breaks and' fades from the astonished&#xD;
grasp. Our cherished habits of thought, our peculb~rities of&#xD;
mind plunge us into trials that others would altogether&#xD;
escape, were they similarly situated. In Amy's condition,&#xD;
many young girls would have settled the matter by pro~&#xD;

&#xD;
flouncing it a sin against heaven to marry without lore, and&#xD;
with some tears and a thousand uncomfortable sensations&#xD;
would have continued free. All this she thought of also;&#xD;
all this she trembled to consider, but there was a stronger&#xD;
force in her nature that urged her to give the only equiva-&#xD;
lent in her power for benefits received: she had no higher&#xD;
light than that which sacrificed her. As she knelt by the&#xD;
hour, sometimes with far-wandering thoughts, and again&#xD;
with intense entreaties, these words came to comfort her.&#xD;
"Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin,&#xD;
and in whose spirit there is no guile." An ambition to&#xD;
become pure, she still might cherish, for although she might&#xD;
he weak, blind and erring, her conscience exempted her from&#xD;
wilful sin: the words of IJoly Writ shone with broadening&#xD;
ray upon her for an instant, and awakened a fleeting hope&#xD;
that she might help to shield from guile, one who had&#xD;
choose her as a life.cornpariion.x. She took her Bible and&#xD;
went to the window to read; her eye fell upon this passage.&#xD;
"Thou hast showed thy people heavy things: thou hast&#xD;
given us a drink of deadly wine." This she read over and&#xD;
over again,~ and after passing on, she returned to it, a~ to t~e&#xD;
echo of' her life: while with a sort of consolation she&#xD;
repeated it, she heard uneven steps, and a girlish voice in&#xD;
the hail. With a, sudden fear that Bel was returning frorn~&#xD;
school very ill, she sprang to the door and found her lean-&#xD;
ing heavily upon a schoolmate, with her eyes half closed-~&#xD;
Afriy received her, and laid her upon the sofa, frightened at&#xD;
her condition : she was soon able to speak and smile, and&#xD;
&#xD;
she whispered," I'll soon be better, Amy! it was coming up&#xD;
stairs," but there was a yearning sense of illness in her look&#xD;
-an appeal that she should be taken care of.&#xD;
"She was very sick in school: Mrs. Barker said she&#xD;
should be placed under a physician's care," said the young&#xD;
girl who had accompanied her home.&#xD;
"Will you go for one 1" demanded the elder sister, laying&#xD;
her hand upon the girl's arm.&#xD;
"For Dr. Kendrick? he is our physician !"&#xD;
"For anybody's-for your mother~~.~~&#xD;
Mary Brown cast an affectionate look upon her friend, and&#xD;
quitted the apartment. Amy sat down by Isabel, whose&#xD;
he~vy eyes were again half closed; her lips were red and&#xD;
thrQwn apart slightly, and a faint pink hue was deepening&#xD;
in her cheeks: a paler face was gently touched to hers, ~"~d&#xD;
a loving voice uttered, "You must not die, Bel, for my sake&#xD;
-I could not bear it,"&#xD;
"I won't die, Amy !" said the invalid, as if her fate de-&#xD;
pended upon her own sweet will. "Won't you fan me&#xD;
When Bel's lovely face reposed upon the white pillow,&#xD;
with her tangled golden curls pushed b8ck from her delicate&#xD;
temple, and held there with her snowy hand, Amy stood&#xD;
* contemplating her in surprise; she had not realized her&#xD;
loveliness, and now she felt it with mingled pain and ~atis-&#xD;
fhction. "You are almost sixteen, BeP?" came slowly from&#xD;
her lips. "I have so much experience now, how I shall&#xD;
watch you, and advise you, as I have never been ~ad-&#xD;
vised-that is, if you should need it," she bathed her&#xD;

face, and then sat down to fhn' her, thinking how soon a&#xD;
woman's responsibility would be upon her, if she lived, and&#xD;
she entreated that she bight live: as she looked upon the&#xD;
child, she was for the first time perhaps, herself far less&#xD;
beautiful; all soft and bright lights had left her countenance,&#xD;
or they only gleamed upon it~ for an instant: her chestnut&#xD;
hair was drawn back, and carelessly knotted; her dress was&#xD;
neat, but without any of the trifling embellishments which&#xD;
go so far ~towards making an ~agreeable toute ensemble.&#xD;
When she dressed that morning, it was a satisfaction to&#xD;
make herself look as plain as possible; she said, "After we&#xD;
are married, he shall not tell me I always took extra pains&#xD;
with my toilette, before the wedding."&#xD;
Dr. Kendrick returned with Mary l3rciwri. As nis 'eye&#xD;
fell upon Amy, he thought she must be his patient, but she&#xD;
pointed to Isabel. sudden admiration passed over his&#xD;
grave face, and he lingered over the lovely' sight crc he ap~&#xD;
preached her: when he did thei'e was something akin to&#xD;
reverence in his 'voice as he questioned her; she hardly&#xD;
noticed him, but said wearily, ~'Te1l him, Amy !"&#xD;
And Amy told hir*k all her symptoms, while he listened&#xD;
thoughtfully, now and then putting a question: he reg~irded&#xD;
her attentively while she spoke, and even after she had&#xD;
ceased speaking, as if he were thinking of her; the regard&#xD;
was sp grave that it did 'not annoy her. "You are not well&#xD;
yourself !" ~he remarked quietly.&#xD;
'"Q yes,' I am !" she returned$~' rising, and going to her&#xD;
&#xD;
sister, but a bright scarlet drove 'away her paleness momen~&#xD;
tarily.&#xD;
"Keep your mind upoh her-she will get well !" he said&#xD;
as he followed her to the sofa: he had discovered in her&#xD;
aspect an anguish th~ cause of which lay deeper than Bel's&#xD;
illness: he hoped he had prescribed 'for it by giving an&#xD;
active direction to her thoughts. TJe~ portioned out his&#xD;
medicine, and bade Amy be careful in following out. his&#xD;
directions; her pro-occupied expression showed that she&#xD;
needed his hint: yet she liked him and trusted him; his&#xD;
motions were all quiet and to the purpose; he looked&#xD;
around very little; he did not once smile, or remark upon&#xD;
any matter unconnected with his profession; y~t he was&#xD;
suddenly interested in that quiet room, and when he reached&#xD;
the street he gave many thoughts to its occupants.&#xD;
After putting ~ cloth saturated with cold water upon&#xD;
Isabel's head, Amy took her old seat beside her, with a*&#xD;
little sewing in her hand; the city clocks struck twelve: it&#xD;
was the hour that Mr. Second had named for his first visit&#xD;
to his betrothed: she wondered to see herself so calmly go&#xD;
through her duties, when her life was so ~hanged-wheu&#xD;
her pulsations were those of double anxiety.&#xD;
She heard his approaching step-her first impulse was to&#xD;
sit in silence, and not disguise the coldness that suddenly&#xD;
froze her whole being, then recollecting that she had given&#xD;
herself to him, she arose and met him, and laid her hand&#xD;
within 'his: he put ~his arm around her, not noticing her&#xD;
sister's couch, but she drew back, and pointed to it-her&#xD;

husky 'voice could not second her gesture. He started to&#xD;
see the sick girl; she had fallen asleep. Amy handed him&#xD;
a chair, and took one a little removed from him.&#xD;
You have growi~jjl from anxiety !" he said.&#xD;
"Thedoctor thinks she ~vill get well !" said Amy, striving&#xD;
to fasten her whole mind as well as her eyes upon her&#xD;
sister.&#xD;
"How long has she been ill ?"&#xD;
"Not long !"&#xD;
"She must have every comfort, Amy! when~ she is&#xD;
stronger, you had better re ove to pleasant rooms. She is&#xD;
not able to ride, I suppose !"&#xD;
No, sir !" She went o the window to conceal the&#xD;
agitation which she could n longer master; fiery tears fell&#xD;
over her cheek as she sto d in silence not wiping them&#xD;
away. Mr. Second's kindness to Bel melted her: he joined&#xD;
her, after watching her a few minutes-he would have used&#xD;
words of endearment, but her manner repelled him: she&#xD;
mechanically strip ~ofl' some dead geranium leaves from a&#xD;
plant that stood before her, but this employment she sud~&#xD;
denly desisted from, least Mr. Second should take the hand&#xD;
that was at work: she could scarcely refrain from fleeing&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
"You are very cold to me~ Amy !" he said in a wounded&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
The genuine feeling in his mariner; his lips which had&#xD;
grown white and stiff, revealed him in a new aspect: he re~&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DENBROOK.       121&#xD;
&#xD;
moved himself a step from her. She covered her face with&#xD;
her hands, and sighed, "I am so sorry !"&#xD;
Sorry for what, Amy?"&#xD;
"That I do not feel as I ought."&#xD;
lie sank on a chair-speechless: man of the world as he&#xD;
his blow struck hard; he ~ad supposed love might be&#xD;
her grateful regard: he was unprepared for her&#xD;
manner, so at variance with her former frank confidingriess.&#xD;
She felt the darkness that came over him ;~ the shock which&#xD;
her want of gratitude gave.&#xD;
"Forgive me!" she entreated, "I had never thought of&#xD;
your caring for me in this way."&#xD;
his pained, reproachful look broke off her words: she&#xD;
sank on a chair, and after weeping passionately, said, "I&#xD;
will do anything, everything you say-I will try to-"&#xD;
"That is all I ask, dear Amy! try to love me, and you&#xD;
will do so: you cannot remain insensible to devotion such&#xD;
as mine-you have cut me to the quick."&#xD;
She looked up, and saw that he had ~poken the truth;&#xD;
she sawn that he truly believed his desire ~o make her happy&#xD;
would succeed-he was a d!gnifled man, proud in his bear-&#xD;
ing: his fixed pursuit of her was the effect of a strong will&#xD;
that did not believe in the word fail. The sligh resent-&#xD;
me~t in his tone gave him an attraction which craven&#xD;
homage alone could not have done-a new interest invests a&#xD;
strong man when he bends under the weight of feeling.&#xD;
Isabel moved restlessly, and Amy hastened to cool her&#xD;
forehead: the fever was going off, and she relapsed into&#xD;

sleep ~gain. The young nurse took a low seat by her lover,&#xD;
noticing as she did so, the sad look he still wore: with a&#xD;
kind 'impulse, and an attempt at her former light manner,&#xD;
she said, "I shall soon get accusk)med to my new relation&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
Mr. Second was silent several minutes, considering&#xD;
whether' it would jeapordise his final possession of her to&#xD;
say, "You shall be free, Amy, if you prefer it." lie con-&#xD;
eluded not to run the risk, but said, "Leave the future to&#xD;
care for itself: think -of yourself only as a beloved friend&#xD;
to me. You are a school-girl yet: continue so as long as&#xD;
you please, only let me surround you with means of&#xD;
pleasure and improvement."&#xD;
Her grateful smile shone on him in reply: but he did not&#xD;
mean to delay' their marriage for years, as she supposed.&#xD;
Her mental condition after this conversation~ was variable:&#xD;
she was drawn tQward him as her best fri ei~d. and protect.&#xD;
tor, and then with swift impulse her very heart fled away&#xD;
desquieted by itself and by him. She studied him. some-&#xD;
times with satisfaction sonletimes with doubt.&#xD;
Isabel had a long and tediop6 fever: when she was able to&#xD;
sit up, Mr. Second daily drove the two girls out into the coun-&#xD;
try; they enjoyed it, both of them : he was too shrewd to&#xD;
spoil Amy's tranquility by assuming the bearing 'of a lover;&#xD;
he rather turned his kindnesses and attentions to the young-&#xD;
er sister for they won him most frequently the frank smile&#xD;
of his betrothed: he did not visit the little home of the&#xD;
orphans except to bring a book, some fruit, or to inquire if&#xD;
&#xD;
Bel would he strong enough to visit the opera or a gallery&#xD;
of paintings on a certain evening. This judicious course on&#xD;
his part gradually restored a measure of Amy's old frank-&#xD;
ness; she could not help admiring his gentle consideration&#xD;
for Bel's weakness-and when sometimes the little conva-&#xD;
lescent laughed heartily at an amusing remark from him, it&#xD;
struck Amy as very amusing too, simply because she saw it&#xD;
through her sister's mind-thus she came to glide into -her'&#xD;
position without the shock which it had first occasioned her.&#xD;
*      Mr. Second said one morning as he handed her into the car-&#xD;
riage for their usual drive, "1 am going to take you to look&#xD;
at the new home I have talked of for you. I hope it wUl&#xD;
please you, little friends! What do you say, Bel ? don't&#xD;
you think you and-Amy could bear a little more style?"&#xD;
"That is - as you say, I suppose sir !" Two days before&#xD;
Mr. Second had made light of Amy's religious convictions,&#xD;
and the matter preyed upon her mind ceaselessly.&#xD;
lie would have glanced at her but she turned her head&#xD;
away, under pretence of gathering her dress into the car-~&#xD;
riage: a sort of agony, shot through her and again it seemed&#xD;
as if the walls of a prison were about her: his elected wife&#xD;
must live more fittingly for her future destiny; he spoke&#xD;
with a settled purpose: he seemed very strong, and her in-&#xD;
4-&#xD;
voluntary 'mental cry was, "Oh!' that I was not bound !"&#xD;
"See! there is the doctor !" cried Bel delighted, she&#xD;
bo~ved smilingly and gracefully as he looked at her fron~ the&#xD;
pavement with a quick lighting up of his usually quiet' ace:&#xD;
he was so intent upon her radiant presence that he did~ not&#xD;

&#xD;
observe her companions: it had chanced that he and Mr.&#xD;
Scored had never met by her sick bed; his reserve had pre-&#xD;
vented his knowing how the young girls lived; he wondered&#xD;
about it, but naturally supposed they must have some small&#xD;
means Of their own, as Bel had begged him to cure her&#xD;
speedily, so that she could go to school again.&#xD;
A cloud gathered upon Mr. Second's brow as he recog~&#xD;
nised the doctor. "What did you say that young man's&#xD;
name was, Jsabe~ ?"&#xD;
"Dr. Kendrick !"&#xD;
"Ithink you mentioned it once, but did I not think about&#xD;
his being identical with this person."&#xD;
"Do you know him, sir ?" questioned Bel with interest.&#xD;
"Slightly! as much as I care about knowing him. J&#xD;
presume you would have been well long before if you had&#xD;
had a do or who knew anything !"&#xD;
"He'kn wsa great deal !?' retorted Bel coloring indig.&#xD;
nantly.&#xD;
"'We'll let that matter go !"&#xD;
The maiden had very red cheeks for an hour after this,&#xD;
and not so gay an expression as she had worn for a few&#xD;
days. They alighted: at a handsome house, and were intro~&#xD;
duced to a matronly lady as Mr. Second's cousin. "Will&#xD;
you show us, the rooms now, Mixs~. Brooks ?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Second in a business-like manner.&#xD;
"Did you say the lady was a cousin of yours, sir ?" asked&#xD;
Amy in a whisper, as she preceded them up a broad fli~,h&#xD;
of sttirs to the second story.&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DENBROOK.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes! yes: she is obliged' to hire out the rooms-sh~&#xD;
will have an interest in you 1"&#xD;
They were ushered into a richly furnished parlor, with&#xD;
marble hearth, mantle, and large windows that opened tc&#xD;
the floor, and led out upon little balconies; bedroom, pantry&#xD;
and drawers were attached.&#xD;
"flow do you like these arrangements, Amy ?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Secora observing her carefully: she knew his thoughts,&#xD;
and that she would seem unthankful if she looked as she&#xD;
felt, lie was so good, yet his goodness was so costly to&#xD;
her: so high priced.&#xD;
"Everytling is very pleasant-very beautiful !" she&#xD;
answered turning to the window to try how it opened; the&#xD;
sh of dependence was ~eating her heart like fire; an&#xD;
attempt at independence would only cause Mr. Scored to&#xD;
hasten the marriage. Mr. Second w~nt to her, removed her&#xD;
little gloved hand with his own, and opened the French&#xD;
window. "Thank you !" she said, "you have provided too&#xD;
beautiful a home for us-I would rather stay where we are,&#xD;
if you will consent, I have said so from the fiYst."&#xD;
"I will 'not consent !" he said, pleased that she admired&#xD;
his tastes: "Amy will grace a room like this!" It gave&#xD;
him p~culiar pleasure to see in her no disposition to gain&#xD;
gifts from him-no overweening love of fine things: he&#xD;
thought her in this respect a rare exception to the women he&#xD;
was in th~ habit of meeting: he contrasted her with his&#xD;
/&#xD;
brother's wife, and congratulated himself upon his choice.&#xD;
"Wont it be nice to have Agnes come to see you here,&#xD;

&#xD;
and Diana too ?" ask~d Del in a whisper, as Mr. Second&#xD;
talked with Mrs. Brooks in a low voice. Amy did not re-&#xD;
ply; a scornful light gleamed in her large eyes, and her lip&#xD;
arched with ~. like disdain. It irritatod her that Is~ihd did&#xD;
not feel that this dependence was ignoble. Bel looked&#xD;
wounded; her innocent nature saw no occasion for this re-&#xD;
ception of her kind rei~ark. Amy soon laid her hand upon&#xD;
her shoulder as an appeal for forgiveness, and said, "Sit&#xD;
down and rest! aren't you tired stand in&#xD;
She remembered 4hat a short time ago, it all scorned right&#xD;
to Aer that Mr. Second should do therr~ a world of kind~&#xD;
nesses; she looked with pity and tenderness upon Del, per-&#xD;
ceiving that no deep knowledge of the world had burned it-&#xD;
self into her life with the events that had happened : she did&#xD;
not desire to destroy her girlish pleasure in their pretty&#xD;
home.&#xD;
In the evening, Amy said, "I happened to think this&#xD;
morning when you spoke of Agnes and Diana, I wi~heJ&#xD;
that. home was ours from our parents, like other girls'&#xD;
homes; I suppose that is what made me look cross at you.&#xD;
I feel utterly unworthy to night."&#xD;
"Don't you think it was strange; Amy, the way Mr.&#xD;
Second spoke of the doctor? You know he has shown me&#xD;
how. to..dissect flowers, and he has dropt so many remarks&#xD;
about them and about insects and a great many other things.&#xD;
I never saw a man that had so much knowledge."&#xD;
"Mr. Second has probably fallen under a wrong impres-&#xD;
sion about him. I should like the doctor if a hiAdred&#xD;
&#xD;
'1&#xD;
&#xD;
people did not think of him as we do: Mr. Second said he&#xD;
knew him slightly; we know him well-I'd trust him with&#xD;
anything, and in any place."&#xD;
"So would 1!" replied Bel withher loveliest smile.&#xD;
At this moment, there was a knock at their door; Amy&#xD;
expected to see Mr. Second as he had promised to call and&#xD;
say when they would inov~. She was a little surprised&#xD;
when Isabel admitted Dr. Kendrick.&#xD;
"Ah ~" she said, rising and giving him her hand with an.&#xD;
animated smile, "we feared, doctor, you would forsake us&#xD;
when Bel no longer needed you !"&#xD;
"I wish she did need me in some way !" he replied laugh-&#xD;
ing and coloring.&#xD;
"Well I do! come look at my herbarium !" said that&#xD;
damsel lightly: everybody had always admired Amy, as&#xD;
she was the elder, and Bel had grown to believe that all&#xD;
gentlemen must of course direct serious regard to her sister,&#xD;
if it were expended upon either, so she was pleased with the&#xD;
doctor's i~emark, but she did not see in it all that Amy. saw,&#xD;
considering herself a child, and an escape-valve for other&#xD;
people's devotion, as she had frequently been in the case of&#xD;
George Coleman, and as she was in regard to Mr. Scored. It.&#xD;
was one of her pretty weaknesses to imagine that everybody&#xD;
must be struck with her sister: everybody was not struck&#xD;
with her, and Del, when she occasionally realized this, was&#xD;
quite surprised. "See how many pages I have filled in two&#xD;
weeks !-it i~ two weeks since you have been here, you&#xD;
know V' she said, opening the herbarium, and laying it on&#xD;

the table before the doctor. "Sit down !" she carried him&#xD;
achair, and then placed one for herself next it.&#xD;
"Where did you ge~ these wild flowei~s, Miss Jsabcl ?" he&#xD;
asked directing his at mentionn to them, and experienci-og a&#xD;
sensation of extreme ai~noyance at the idea of her being pro&#xD;
vided with them by ~ one but himself~&#xD;
"0,1 gathered them ~nyseli or Amy and I did !"&#xD;
"AhI where do the~e grow plentifully?" pointing to a&#xD;
page.&#xD;
"We got them at Bloomingdale !-but we saw a great&#xD;
many at Yorkville; and Astoria-.--and a few on Staten&#xD;
Island."&#xD;
"You have been out in the country frequently then ?"&#xD;
he said taking out his penknife, and erasing a tiny blot.&#xD;
"Yes! every pleasant day. I meant to have scratched&#xD;
out that little blot, but I forgot it. Amy ! see how pretty&#xD;
these flowers look, now that they are dry !" she held up the&#xD;
volume a moment.&#xD;
"Yes! they are beautiful !" replied Amy, looking up from&#xD;
her sewing rather to contemplate the two persons than the&#xD;
flowers: there was a charm in Bel's innocent freedom, and&#xD;
in the doctor's repressed manner.&#xD;
".W e're going to move! did you know it ?" questioned&#xD;
the convalescent,&#xD;
"No! how should I? Where are you going?"&#xD;
"In street !"&#xD;
"Who is going to move you ?" he asked regarding her&#xD;
with a smile.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Second! he is our guardian! You will come and&#xD;
see us in our new home, won't you?"&#xD;
~' Does Miss Amy second the invitation ?" turning toward&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Ceiainly, doctor, we regard you as a friend, rather than&#xD;
as a physician now."&#xD;
Mr. Scored joined the liltIe party the next moment; he&#xD;
bowed distantly to Dr. Kendrick, and then motioned Amy&#xD;
to a seat on the sofa next hjm, where he entered into the de-&#xD;
tails of the following day's moving. It was his plan to take&#xD;
the two girls to their new abode, order what they would&#xD;
want sent to them, and then have everything else go to an&#xD;
auction room.&#xD;
"I want to take that little roeking.chair !" said Amy.&#xD;
"You don't want that, do you ?" touching it with his boot.&#xD;
"Yes! it was mother's !"&#xD;
"Then keep it by all means 1"&#xD;
"I would rather superintend the moving myself."&#xD;
"It will be a tedious business for you-too fatiguing !"&#xD;
"But the woman you speak of, will not know what I&#xD;
want to take. Some things are dear to me."&#xD;
"Lay aside what you want 1"&#xD;
"That can't be done in a short time !-I will stay, while&#xD;
you take Bel to the new house."&#xD;
'"Very well, if you are suited that is all that is necessary:&#xD;
I th~nik we shall move harmoniously."&#xD;
The next evening 'Dr. Kendrick received the following&#xD;
Liote, to intimate that his professional visits were at an end.&#xD;

"DR. KEi~DnIoI~ :-~r: I should feel obliged if you&#xD;
would send me the bill Miss Isabel Denbrook's illness, at&#xD;
an early date.&#xD;
"Yours, &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
"JUSTIN SECOND."&#xD;
"We will see if you are to be my tyrant in this case,&#xD;
sir !" mused the young physician, as he tQok up his pen, and&#xD;
instantly made out his bill.~&#xD;
"He intimates in this way that my intercourse with isa..&#xD;
bel is dissolved..~he is mistaken. I have brain and strength,&#xD;
and they shall win me the right to sue that others have-I&#xD;
am a man, and in myself have as much to offer the woman&#xD;
of my choice, as that man has: and yet, my little fragile&#xD;
one, I will be the last to bring you to toil arid hard service,&#xD;
should you ever give yourself to me." The doctor put an&#xD;
end to his musings with the abruptness of a man who has a&#xD;
motive to work; he copied until after niidnight, and when&#xD;
he pushed back his chair and threw down his pen, his cheeks&#xD;
were deeply flushed and his eyes glittered with the energy&#xD;
of determination: he arose at daybreak, and continued his&#xD;
writing until his usual hour for making professional visits.&#xD;
The "I will !" had gone~down more deeply into his spirit,&#xD;
and it asserted itself the conquerer~ of difficulties, for it&#xD;
stood obedient only to the mandates of the Supreme Will&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
"AMY, it is too bad we have not been to see Mrs. Coleman&#xD;
in such a great while !" Is4abel exclaimed one day as they&#xD;
were returning from school together. It must be three&#xD;
months since we called. Let us go now, I know she must&#xD;
be lonely."&#xD;
"You may go, Bel! I wish you would, but I want to.&#xD;
study, and must go directly home."&#xD;
"0 no! she will think we are proud since we live and&#xD;
dress more handsomely than we used to do."&#xD;
"She wouldn't be so silly. Perhaps I had better go!&#xD;
They accordingly went, but found that Mrs. Coleman was&#xD;
boarding like themselves, and was in a new place; this&#xD;
they sought, and half fearing it was too stylish a house to&#xD;
be the right one, they rang the bell. They were ushered&#xD;
into a room as fresh and handsome as their own, and Mrs.&#xD;
Coleman came forward to meet them kindly; the~ next&#xD;
instant George entered from a back room: his presence&#xD;
was so unexpected Amy turned red and white alternately;,&#xD;
he had the advantage of her for he had heard her voice.&#xD;
He greeted Isabel first, and with much cordiality, and' then,&#xD;
with some pride~and more feeling, shook hands~ with Amy.&#xD;

&#xD;
"We thought you were at sea !" she said as soon as the&#xD;
.~hokin~ in her throat would allow her to speak.&#xD;
"I returned two week's ago !" he answered, surprised to&#xD;
see how speca ly she took a quiet and self controlled air;&#xD;
she was reser~ ed; not the laughing Amy~of his renlem&#xD;
branee.&#xD;
"You have oved since we saw you, Mrs. Coleman !"&#xD;
she said turning to her.&#xD;
"Yes! we c me here a week ago. Ge2rge's uncle has&#xD;
left him a large property, and that made his return neces-&#xD;
sary. He has been to Spain !"&#xD;
"Indeed !"&#xD;
"He won't have as hard a time'as formerly," the mother&#xD;
smiled fondly.&#xD;
"Poverty is sometimes a valuable test, mother. If my&#xD;
uncle had died a year ago, I might have seemed different in&#xD;
the eyes of my friends." George's lip wore the scornful&#xD;
curve that it had worn upon the evening of his parting with&#xD;
~ my: she saw that he must have heard of her relation to&#xD;
r. Scored, and deemed her mercenary: she looked at him&#xD;
proudly; he could not meet her eyes: he Was still too&#xD;
weak for that.&#xD;
"Shall you become a lawyer ~" asI~ed Isabel, hoping to&#xD;
turn the unfortunate direction which conversation had&#xD;
taken.&#xD;
"I shall. You are going to school, Bel !"&#xD;
"How did you know ?~ have you been to see us durin~&#xD;
our absence from home ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"No! I have not been to see you. Dr. Kendrick is an&#xD;
acquai~itanCC of mine: he. told me that you and Amy had&#xD;
been attending school for some time past. , I saw Mr.&#xD;
Second yesterday-you have become acquainted with him,&#xD;
it seems." Anothcr look was directed to Amy: it stung&#xD;
her acutely, the more so that she must submit to be meas-&#xD;
urably misjudged: it was very bitter to have George think&#xD;
her an artful, scheming girl; had he been near her, when&#xD;
heP landlord first become her benefactor, she would have&#xD;
been enlightened as to the n~otive of Mr.~ Secord's gene-&#xD;
rosity when it was first offered: George's knowledge qf the&#xD;
world was far wider than had been that of the credulous&#xD;
orphans. Mrs. Coleman did all in her powor to atone for&#xD;
the bitterness of her son, which she well understood; 'she&#xD;
saw that Amy was taxing all the pride atid bravery of her&#xD;
nature to bear up with lady-like quietness under the wounds&#xD;
that struck her, and her manner therefore was as gentl&amp;amp; as&#xD;
it had been on the day that the children had been left father-&#xD;
less. Amy would not instantly retreat as had been her&#xD;
impulse when she saw, George; she determined to stay ~a&#xD;
qi~rter of an hour and talk on common-place subjects until&#xD;
she could regain an indifferent manner-she would not&#xD;
leavo him with the impression that ne could agitate her~&#xD;
for more than a surprised moment, so she sat under her tor-&#xD;
turing ordeal, conversing and even smiling with his mother,&#xD;
knowing that her profile was watched by him, as he vainly&#xD;
strove to talk connectedly with Bel on ordinary topics.&#xD;
She had a subtle dignity that compelled his respect for the&#xD;

moment. When they parted, there was neither hauteur nor&#xD;
Coolness ~in hers graceful adieu, but something~ more cutting'&#xD;
still-a something that said, "You and I are mere-&#xD;
mere acquaintances !" Yet he could no forbear offering&#xD;
his hand as he saw her passing from h rn-as it were,&#xD;
eternally.&#xD;
When the two girls reached the stre t, Amy hastily&#xD;
drew down her ~.rei1 to conceal the tears hat fell-.-Isabel&#xD;
observed the motion, and detected the suffe ing face.&#xD;
"I suppose George suspects that you ar engaged to Mr.&#xD;
Second !"&#xD;
"I Suppose so !, I don't like to have him think I tried to&#xD;
interest Mr. Second because he was rich !"&#xD;
"I believe George would be glad to marry you yet,&#xD;
Amy!"&#xD;
"We are as unsuited to each other as we always were-&#xD;
you see he does not judge me tenderly-with allowance !"&#xD;
"Perhaps not, but you and he are better suited, than you&#xD;
and Mr. Second."&#xD;
"Hush, Bel !"&#xD;
"Why !" demanded she after a short obedience.&#xD;
"There is no use in talking about these things !"&#xD;
"But you said once that Mr. Second had bought you-I&#xD;
am sure "&#xD;
~' Mr. Scored lobs me, sincerely. If I could not marry&#xD;
George when he was poor, I cannot marry him when he i~&#xD;
rich-I have already hurt Mr. Second: it would be doubly&#xD;

base to seem ~bo~h ungrateful and mercenary. You know I&#xD;
am engaged to him: engaged."&#xD;
lEven as she spqke, she hid frqm Isabel the doubts t1~at&#xD;
,wrenched her heart.&#xD;
"You love George best 1"&#xD;
"Cease tempting me !" uttered Amy, grasping her sister's&#xD;
hand with the force of sharp feeling.&#xD;
"I don't mean to tempt you, Amy-but your happiness is&#xD;
' so dear to me-it seems as if I can't help saying what I&#xD;
think. I know it wou1~d seem dreadful to break your en.&#xD;
gagement to Mr. Second when he has idolized you so long,&#xD;
and has been ~a benefactor to us. I can't help thinking if&#xD;
things had been a little different--"&#xD;
"If things had been a little different, we should live a ro-&#xD;
mance, but the story of life is broken, disjointed, full of un-&#xD;
welcome surprises-circumstances are too much for us-we&#xD;
cannot weave the plot: God's hand is too powerful; all we&#xD;
havt~ to do is to look through the great darkness, and follow&#xD;
the path that seems right at the time-if it turn out the&#xD;
wrong one, God forgive us."&#xD;
"But it caDnot turn out the wrong one in our Heavenly&#xD;
Father's sight, if the motive has been sincere, can it ?"&#xD;
"No! that is true: it often rests in my heart, Bel, that it&#xD;
would be a species' of cruelty and dishonesty not to devote&#xD;
my life to Mr. Scored. I know that ~i torturing array of ar-&#xD;
gument can be brought against my position; one set of my&#xD;
faculties and feelings has thus argued, but at the end of&#xD;

place.. I seem called to x~alk with a man whose natural&#xD;
goodness I may perhaps* deepen into Christian grace;. hi~&#xD;
love for me, and the singular web of incident about me irn~&#xD;
pels me to believe th~i t my mission may be oi'dered by a&#xD;
will higher than my own. if he were bad-if I had reason&#xD;
to* believe that he never ~would become religious then I&#xD;
should fling every other motive to the winds--I should be&#xD;
free-there has been a wearing conflict in my mind ever&#xD;
since I have been engaged-I want to put off the marriage&#xD;
until I am at r~est-I have suffered so much, Bel, that it&#xD;
would bring me peace to know that I was the child of right&#xD;
even though I could not be the child of happiness. I never&#xD;
meant to tell you thcse thoughts, for the lips [of a promised&#xD;
wife should be sealed, if they cannot speak of joy, but it&#xD;
seemed as if my heart would break without utterance.&#xD;
Agnes and Diana are going to leave school this fall; and&#xD;
make their regular debut in society-I should leave too, only&#xD;
I fear it would make Mr. Second think it was time to be&#xD;
married?&#xD;
"0 dear !" sighed Bel. "I wish I could bear half of your.&#xD;
sorrows, Amy!"&#xD;
"A great many people suffer more, I suppose, I3e1: some&#xD;
of the time my spirits are good, you know: it xviii all&#xD;
come out right sometime."&#xD;
"We must walk a little faster. Mr. Second was to come&#xD;
at half past five for you to return Mrs. Ashley's call, and&#xD;
you must put on your very handsomest apparel."&#xD;
"1 dbn't care what I w~ar-she hated to call on me, I&#xD;
&#xD;
know, or Mr. Scored would not have brought her-she is so&#xD;
haughty. I wouldn't stir a step toward her house, if he did not&#xD;
seem so desirous that I should make her acquaintance.&#xD;
Probably I am  an artful girl   her eyes, as well as&#xD;
in Gcorge's."&#xD;
"Well don't put on your pr~Gd look, as if the earth&#xD;
were too mean for your step. If you go to oblige Mr.&#xD;
Second, behave as he would like to have you."&#xD;
"I will ! I'm glad you mentioned it, for I was just think-&#xD;
/ ing what a satisfaction it would be to meet Mrs. Ashley in&#xD;
haughtier style than her own."&#xD;
"And you must dress handsomely: he likes to see you&#xD;
well dressed-he is always bringing you something that is&#xD;
costly."&#xD;
An hour after this,, Amy emerged from her home, leaning&#xD;
on the arm~of her lover and wended her way to Mrs. Ash-&#xD;
ley's with him: when he saw her seated in the magnificent&#xD;
apartment of his sister4n.law, he regarded her xv ith secret&#xD;
exultation; he rejoicedin her youth, grace and beauty: she&#xD;
possessed in herself enough to make her charming in the&#xD;
circles of fashion, and he possessed the wealth to surround&#xD;
her with the eclat that he desired: her manner toward him&#xD;
before company suited him exactly; it was respect-&#xD;
1 and considerate, [hut neither distant nor familiar: he.&#xD;
wished that when alone with him, she seemed as much at&#xD;
rest by his side.&#xD;
'"Have you seen your frh~nd Miss Leonard within a few&#xD;
days, Miss Denbr6ok?" inquired Mr~. Ashley.&#xD;

&#xD;
"I have flot! she has not been at school this week."&#xD;
"She is to be my guest this winter !" Mrs. Ashley&#xD;
smiled as if very much pleased.&#xD;
"How is that ~ it is a n~w movement, isn't it V' asked&#xD;
Mr. Scored.&#xD;
"Yes! quite new. Mrs,, Iiarrington's health is delicate,&#xD;
and her husband is anxious to take her to Cuba for the&#xD;
winter-when I put in my plea for Agnes, she consented to&#xD;
go."&#xD;
"I am very glad she wiil be here I" said 'Amy with anima.&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Mrs. Ashley condescended to a gracious expression of&#xD;
countenance at this-she thought Amy must like her, and it&#xD;
flattered her; but the real reason of the maiden's satisfac-&#xD;
tion was, that Mr. Second inclined to urge her to an inti-&#xD;
macy with his brother's wife, and the lady w~s profuse 'in&#xD;
hollow invitations: it would not be difficult to visit fre-&#xD;
quently the house where Agnes dwelt. As they were speak-&#xD;
ing with more ease then at first, a lady entered the parlor,&#xD;
with her bonnet in one hand; the twilight prevented her&#xD;
countenance from being seen distinctly, but her form and air&#xD;
were graceful. She bowed to Mr. Scored, who rose and&#xD;
shook hands with her as with a previous acquaintance.&#xD;
Amy was introduced to her as the friend 6f Mrs. Ashley-&#xD;
Mi's. Collins. She did not utter a word save the compli-&#xD;
ments of the evening after her' entrance; the visitors took&#xD;
their 1e~we soon after; Mrs. Collins also left her hostess&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
"GOT a new beau, too--you know-to exhibit!' whispered&#xD;
Diana to Amy as they sat at their desk in school; s14&#xD;
flourished l~er jewelled hand towards her left as she spoke.&#xD;
"Have you snapt his head off yet?" asked Amy careless-&#xD;
ly, as she leaned back to survey a botanical drawing.&#xD;
"I haven't had time yet--he only appeared on the arena&#xD;
last evening. Splendid! perf-.~plen 1" these last syllables&#xD;
meant perfectly splendid: it sometimes happened that Diana&#xD;
affected to overflow with so much delight that she had not&#xD;
time to dress her emotions in whole words. Pin goin~ to&#xD;
have him at my jubilee next week! What a little goose&#xD;
you are not to'leave school ~oo."~&#xD;
"0, keep stIll! you're forever talking and exposing me&#xD;
to suspicion. Mrs. Barker's eye will be on us in a minute."&#xD;
"Come to my party, and I'll stop! if you don't I'll tor-&#xD;
ment your life out until' I leave school. Will you come ?"&#xD;
she laid one haid on Amy's back comb and with the other&#xD;
susp~ded an inkstand over her drawing, looking so un-&#xD;
speakably malevolent, that Amy suddenly hovered her&#xD;
I&#xD;
mouth to keep back her laughter, and closed her eyes in ex-&#xD;
pressive winks, not daring to nod lest Mrs. Barker should&#xD;
&#xD;
suppose her an accomplice in Diana's disorder, rather th'an a&#xD;
victim to it.&#xD;
"I'll tell MIr. Second you make faces at me ?" she veti-&#xD;
~tiired as soon as she could speak.&#xD;
"Are you subjugated? say 'yes' or your hyacinthine&#xD;
locks will be given to the breeze, and your dress will be del-&#xD;
uged with a sable flood !~' whi.'~pered the tormenter in a&#xD;
friendly and confidin~ voice.&#xD;
"Yes, I'll come in the middle of the afternoon."&#xD;
Diana put back the inkstand and released the comb with&#xD;
a patronizing pat on her companion's head, saying, "The&#xD;
little thing means xvell enough but she's weak !"&#xD;
V&#xD;
"Miss Blake, I consider your conduct extremely unlady-&#xD;
V       like !" sounded across the school-roornfrom Nt ts. Barker's&#xD;
desk.&#xD;
After this the two scholars went on with their drawing in&#xD;
&amp;amp;ouimendable silence.&#xD;
"lie used to study law wjth father, and he's going to be-&#xD;
gin again !" broke out Diana after as long a silence as she&#xD;
could possibly preserve.&#xD;
"Who?"&#xD;
4,        " iMiy new beau !"&#xD;
"Who is he ?" questioned Amy with a startled blush, for&#xD;
she knew that George Coleman had been a student of Mr.&#xD;
Blake's , although he had neYer made the acquaintance of his&#xD;
family.&#xD;
"lie's a Mr. Coleman! stately, majestic, intellectual,&#xD;
lordly. He has lately received a fortune, and I suppose that&#xD;

&#xD;
made my beloved father think that his society would not be&#xD;
unsuitable for his family."&#xD;
"I don't see how you ~an flirt so, Diana, when you are en-&#xD;
*&#xD;
gaged !"&#xD;
"hush! I'll never tell you anything again, if you mention&#xD;
that so loudly. Thei'e's no harm in it, for 1 would lay down&#xD;
my life for Marcus--I would go with him to a prison or a&#xD;
hovel."&#xD;
"I know that! but you would not refrain from wounding&#xD;
him every day."&#xD;
"0 he! he thinks all the more of me for being on the&#xD;
anxious seat part of the time."&#xD;
"If he has anything of Agnes' disposition, he ~vill beay so&#xD;
much, and no mor~. Some fatal day Diana, you.will w~ep&#xD;
bitter tears, if I am not mistaken !"&#xD;
"Well, Amy, the truth is this, Mr. Colem~tn was so in~lif~&#xD;
ferent to me as to ihake the fact most conspicuous to ~ny&#xD;
observation: it came very near piquing m~ into a deterniina.&#xD;
don for revenge. There! I'm a better girl than you sup-&#xD;
posed. I only flirt, a very little !"&#xD;
Another silence fell, and continued until the school was&#xD;
dismissed.&#xD;
The next week Amy went with Mr. Second to Diana's&#xD;
party. It was painful to her to go into company with her&#xD;
lover; she felt the disparity in their ~es, still she ~vent.&#xD;
She met George there; a dark and scornful look flashed&#xD;
upon her as she accidentally encountered him in the hall:&#xD;
he bowed coldly; many times during the evening his eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
were fastened upon Mr. Scored, and when he saw him speak&#xD;
to Amy or show her any casual attention, the slight disdain-&#xD;
fiil curve passed over his lip, and was gone again: he was&#xD;
not one to nurse spiteful thoughts in secret; they looked&#xD;
out candidly from his countenance. He was most particu-&#xD;
tar in his devotion to Miss Blake, probably forgetting the&#xD;
heinousnesS with which coquetry had struck him, when he&#xD;
thought ~{iss Denbrook addicted to it. He did not of&#xD;
course know that Mr. Leonard considered him the most&#xD;
wretched apology for a man extant; that person kept his&#xD;
9&#xD;
own counsel, and his gentlemanly bearing did not indicate&#xD;
the unrest within him: he did not watch Diana after the&#xD;
first moment, he had no desire to aggravate the difficulty of&#xD;
his behavior, after having witnessed the joyous and laugh-&#xD;
ing face with which she n~et Mr. Coleman's jests-most in-&#xD;
significant jests they were, he knew, and George also-but&#xD;
people laughed as if they enjoyed them.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
DIANA BLARE was an only child; she had been petted from&#xD;
her birth and had ruled the family always. Even when a&#xD;
school-girl, her mother could not resist her entreaties to in-&#xD;
troduce her into society: she soon became a belle, and&#xD;
every evening when she was at home, the gas was lighted.&#xD;
iii the parlors-upo~i these occasions; she flitted into the&#xD;
rooms tastefully dressed, ready to r~cciye any gentlemen&#xD;
who might chance ti call; her mother unwisely kept aloof,&#xD;
as American mothers are apt to do, and the pretty coquette&#xD;
was left to obey every freak of her most wilful nature.&#xD;
Two evenings after the party which had celebrated her&#xD;
emancipation from school life, she made her entrance into&#xD;
the parlors robed in white; the evening was balmy, although&#xD;
it was early in November; her fair neck and round arms&#xD;
glittered with jewels; she was a showy girl, and ornaments&#xD;
became her; roses were wreathed in her brown hair, hot.~&#xD;
house roses from her lover; they blushed in the bosom of&#xD;
her dress, and hung from her girdle. She expected Marcus&#xD;
Leonard, and she had arrayed herself with especial pleasure&#xD;
for him: he did not come as early as usual, and she was&#xD;
&#xD;
particularly jealous of'any event, or even aceiden~t that could&#xD;
not be conquered immediately for the sake of i'eaching her';&#xD;
Leonard usually visited every evening, or they had en gage.&#xD;
ments at the same places; on the previous evening he had&#xD;
sent her the flowers, without a note, or any comment on his&#xD;
absence. She felt vexed every time she took out her watch&#xD;
to observe the time; at length there was a ring at the street&#xD;
bell, and a gentleman was ushered into her presence; it was&#xD;
a bitter disappointmeift to her, when she saw Mr. Coleman;&#xD;
he did not visit her in the expectation of being made very&#xD;
happy, but she was lively and amusing enough to divert&#xD;
him as he was not aware of her engagement, he hoped that&#xD;
she would report his visits to Amy, and he was wicked&#xD;
enough to think such a report would be annoying to her, and&#xD;
would make her realize the mistal~ she had made in not ac-&#xD;
cepting him. Diana was too shrewd not to have detected&#xD;
that there was very little heart in Mr. Coleman's attentions;&#xD;
she resolved that he should feel what he assumed-she put&#xD;
on a careless manner, and began to talk upon topics which.&#xD;
were calculated to interest him, and to display her own in2&#xD;
tellectual abilities, foi~ these were of a high order; it was an&#xD;
agreeable ~surprise to him to find unsuspected depths of'&#xD;
thought and acquirement in the merry girl-she had the&#xD;
faculty of using what she did know to capital advantage.&#xD;
When he was really aroused and interested, she went off in&#xD;
her usual light and witty style, as if she disdained to show&#xD;
her worthier self long. They jested to the point, and with&#xD;
actual zest after a deeper insight into each other's characters;&#xD;

Diana saw that he was thinking her absolutely charming.&#xD;
"May I ask for this?" he inquired, lightly pointing, to a&#xD;
moss rose with which she was toying. "I have distracting&#xD;
fears that you will tear it in pieces."&#xD;
"Yes, you shall have i !" she good humoredly replied,&#xD;
glying it into his hand. A she raised her eyes, she encoun-&#xD;
tered the stern gaze of Ma cus Leonard; he had not heard&#xD;
the light Conversation of th two; he had only seen his gift&#xD;
transferred into the palm o another, as if it had been of no&#xD;
value: he walked forward a step and bowed to the two, then&#xD;
beckoning to her, went through the back parlor and into the&#xD;
conservatory. She impulsively followed him without a&#xD;
word of explanation or excuse to her companion.&#xD;
"Diana! take your ring !" Leonard's voice was husky,&#xD;
but he handed the circlet to her x~ith a bitter laugh, as ~he&#xD;
joined him.; her face looked perfectly white in the bright&#xD;
twilight of the conservatory.&#xD;
She took it, and, with all the power withi+x her nature&#xD;
stirred, drew from her own finger the ring which he had&#xD;
placed there; she was ill-used to bearing the rebuke which&#xD;
his whole action had administered.&#xD;
"Have you anything else to say to me, Mr. Leonard?&#xD;
any other business to transact ?" she asked with a plentitude&#xD;
of haughtiness.&#xD;
"' I have nothing more to say henceforth !" he returned&#xD;
bowing, and his action was as full of bitter pride as hex&#xD;
own. He left her, and she heard his step ring along the hail.&#xD;
she heard the street door close after him ; then she dropped&#xD;

uj~on the floor senseless; no ohe heard her; when she re-&#xD;
covered and entered the parlors, they were deserted.&#xD;
Marcus Leonard walked the streets for many hours that&#xD;
night, and they were all filled with vehement bitterness; his&#xD;
good angels, if they looked ix~ upon the tempest within him,&#xD;
gave no token of their presence. But the next day he was&#xD;
more quiet, and with less jaundiced sight reviewed thelife&#xD;
which he had lately led; he was free from the slavery of infat-&#xD;
uated passion, although its effects lingered upon him: he ha&amp;amp;&#xD;
reached the point toward which his e4eriences had been&#xD;
tending; they demanded freedom from jealousy-they asked&#xD;
in his loved one, a singleness of affection equal to his own-&#xD;
they asked for rest and peace, they dent anded a different&#xD;
person from his erring, too fascinating Diai a He was fixed&#xD;
in his purpose to give her up-he was unshaken in judgment&#xD;
although deeply shaken in feeling: her sweetest looks her&#xD;
heaviest tears could not have undone the results which his&#xD;
study of her had brought about: the event that parted them&#xD;
was such a circumstance as would have happened sooner or&#xD;
later: it precipitated the purpose that had been forming&#xD;
almost unconsciously in his own mind: he had a horror of&#xD;
women that are solicitous for the adulation of many, rather&#xD;
than for the deep love of one. He was impatient at the&#xD;
misery that gnawed his heart. lie ~aid "I am free !" as he&#xD;
paced his room, and there was a half smile on his lip as he&#xD;
spoke, but the smile was in self disdain: his eyes, which were&#xD;

handsome face was pale, and its intellectual cast was more&#xD;
observable in its gloom; he looked severe, but nut happy in&#xD;
his strength-he looked the exact reverse of the man who&#xD;
spoke with his friends, for in his darkness there beamed out&#xD;
no iiAications of a genial and attractive nature.&#xD;
"I'll return to books !" he mused, as he glanced toward&#xD;
his library. "I'll be governed after this by my head and not&#xD;
my heart-they are superficial, (they meant woman) hasty,&#xD;
but not reliable-this superficiality I abhor! A man is bet-&#xD;
ter off to remain in the cold domain of his intellect, than to&#xD;
trifle with them. And yet why were they created, if not to&#xD;
fill a void in our nature, that craves something out of itself?&#xD;
I was well enough satisfied with the manner of man I was,&#xD;
before this episode with Diana-I was filling my brain with&#xD;
new and strong food-~-now there is a singular craving as if&#xD;
I had been introduced into a new chamber of my soul's&#xD;
house, and an influence issued therefrom that debarred&#xD;
me from being what I was ere it was revealed to me. It'&#xD;
Diana had been what I hoped, if she could have filled this&#xD;
new want of my life, I should then have been ,~t rest to pur-&#xD;
sue old aims. But what folly to muse thus! why not force&#xD;
myself back to what I was ?--this can be done in a measure.&#xD;
I started upon the race of life with streaming banner and&#xD;
bold defiance. More than this, my forgotten God, I kn&amp;amp;lt&#xD;

myself-with deeper devotion to the cause of righteousness.&#xD;

I have held to the outward forms, while I have made small&#xD;

ly draitied the essence of Diana~s life, th~t I have lost some&#xD;
of my own. I return to myself as I break from her--I re-&#xD;
turn to find that no new strength has accrued to me during&#xD;
my life of passion-and yet is it her life that I received, or&#xD;
did she reveal to me only what existed in myself? Agnes&#xD;

misery were a sure consequence of this act, I would take up&#xD;
the burden and leave you." lie sat down by his desk, and&#xD;
loxyered his head upon his arms-he was not given to weep-&#xD;
ing, but his tears fell there, and he was ashamed of them -&#xD;
there was no need of shame, for they came from a source&#xD;
almost as pure as the source of his praj*ers.&#xD;
Marcus Leonard's uncle, Mr. Harrington, had for several&#xD;
months past desired him to take up his evidencece abroad as&#xD;
a partner in his business: he was a merchant, ~nd he&#xD;
thought the limited time which it would take to buy goods&#xD;
in England, France and Germany would leave Marcus an&#xD;
opportunity for tra~eV and study during a large part of tim&#xD;
year. The gentleman who was to undertake this business&#xD;
was averse to it: it would have been peculiarly acceptable&#xD;
to Marcus had it not involved a separation from Diana. Tie&#xD;
was now free to g6; one day, shortly after his parting with&#xD;
Miss Blake, he passed the door of his sister's room, it stood&#xD;
ajar, and he saw her kneeling before a~ trunk which she was&#xD;
packing. "Come in, Marcus !" she cried,, as she stowed a&#xD;
glove boK in its place.&#xD;
lie entered; and stood a little behind her, looking down&#xD;
upon her. "You seem to be terribly busy !" he said.&#xD;
"Yes! I want to leave to-morrow immediately after uncle&#xD;
and aunt do. I hate to have the family broken up-uncle and&#xD;
aunt at Havana, and you boarding at a hotel-you must&#xD;
come and see me every day at Mrs. Ashley's, will you ?"&#xD;
"No! that will be impossible !"&#xD;
She looked up hastily, and then rose to her feet. lie had&#xD;
&#xD;
preserved his ordinary manner until this moment. What is&#xD;
the matter, Marcus ~"&#xD;
"I am going abroad. You know uncle has wanted me to&#xD;
for some time !"&#xD;
"Yes! but you are in trouble sit down !"&#xD;
He obeyed, and she laid her head on~ his shoulder, and&#xD;
put her arms around him. "What is it, dear2 wom~t vuu&#xD;
tell me ~" her voice was dif the gentlest, tenderest tone.&#xD;
"My engagement is broken I" he abruptly said.&#xD;
She did not make any inquiry as to the cause of it: she&#xD;
guessed. it. "I will not ask yr~u to stay then, Marcus.&#xD;
You need the change of scene."&#xD;
"Will you be a faithful friend to Diana ?"&#xD;
~ will ! I will be most faithful !"&#xD;
his sternly-set lips and sombre eyes were more than she&#xD;
could easily bear, and she dropt her h~ead upon his shoulder&#xD;
after she had lifted it to answer him; his noble heart and&#xD;
kingly brain were her wo~'ship-she saw none of his faults-&#xD;
she believed only in his aspirations :-in the approaching&#xD;
future she saw men growing better and wiser, as they&#xD;
- gleaned pearls of trut  from him.&#xD;
After he had made arrangements to. embark for England&#xD;
in two days, he sat down and penned a letter to Diana; he&#xD;
told her of his deep affection, and also of the great fault&#xD;
which had driven their lots asunder; he gave her liberty to&#xD;
gather to her breast the floating homage which had weighed&#xD;
against his love. He withheld his communication until a&#xD;
few h~urs before he xvent on hoard the vessel. When in his&#xD;

little state-room, he clasped Agnes to his heart for the last&#xD;
time, there came before his mental sight a vision of a pallid&#xD;
and yearning face-it was fancy ! SO we say, yet a strong&#xD;
and thrilling consciousue~s caused him to believe that at that&#xD;
instant Diana was reading his farcw~ll. A second time he&#xD;
repeated his ehai~ge to Agnes. "Be a friend to Diana ~" and&#xD;
then he was left alone.&#xD;
Of a truth; the soul of the stricken girl had reached him ;.&#xD;
at that very hour she sat in her luxuiloPs chamber, with her&#xD;
eyes upon the fatal letter, but the spirit was turning toward&#xD;
the vessel that was making ready to sail-she turned to see if&#xD;
the unutterable light that had beamed upon her from his gaze&#xD;
were lost-she received no assurance-it was fancy all, that&#xD;
he could comprehend the tide of anguish and yeatning~that&#xD;
s~t toward him, yet her every life-beat as she looked toward&#xD;
the sea, was an entreaty to stay his cruel purposQof departure.&#xD;
lie quitted his state-room, and watched the sailors casting&#xD;
off the lines: when the steamer first ploughed the w~ives, he&#xD;
mentally uttered, "Now the impossible has come between&#xD;
me, and this sudden impulse to retrace my course: it is well&#xD;
perhaps that the machinery of this vessel, and the uncon-&#xD;
scious will of another man shou-ld keep me steady in. my&#xD;
chosen path. So we help and hinder one anotheix Sc,&#xD;
Diana, my life parts from yours." The strength of his wilt&#xD;
had triumphed over all emotions ~ but when he no longer&#xD;
needed to exert it, the rein seemed given to his tnadness of&#xD;
desire once more to behold her-once more to pour out the&#xD;
rich argosy of his idolatry.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE Eastern sunrise shone into the room. Isabel was in the&#xD;
adjoining chamber dressing.. Amy looked from the window&#xD;
through which the glory streamed: she smiled as she stood&#xD;
in the brightness. " Thus I can stand in God's love" she&#xD;
murmured, as she gazed over the housetops at the rising&#xD;
illumination. After a while she went to a richly-carved&#xD;
book-ease; below the shelves were two drawers-one was&#xD;
appropriated to Isabel, and one was all her own: she kept&#xD;
the key; for in the drawer was deposited a record of her&#xD;
secret thoughts. She had kept i~ journal since her engage-&#xD;
ment, for it had by its very nature thrown her back upon&#xD;
herself-she was no longer the frank girl that she had been.&#xD;
To Del she usually revealed a comparatively cheerful outer-&#xD;
most-4o hen lover she wore a visiting aspect-she talked&#xD;
of European politics, of new books, lectures, and of her&#xD;
studies-to the white pages of her journal she turned with&#xD;
sad, happy or wayward thoughts-she did not receive con-&#xD;
solation by refleding, without writing. When her ~ uP&#xD;
thirsted to pour forth its locked-up life, she took her diary&#xD;
from its hiding place, and penned her eager thoughts-exist-&#xD;

gushed from her inmost heart-she kept no statistical&#xD;

her frequent devouring desire to break her betrothal chains&#xD;

~that she might in some way pour out her soul arid treasure&#xD;
at. the feet of the suffering: her cry for a deep draug~it of&#xD;
joy: her importance in the great, world if she acted by her-&#xD;
self-all these things formed the ~taple of her written&#xD;
words.&#xD;
While she was unlocking her drawer, a hasty knock dis-&#xD;
turbed her. Shie went to the door, and saw Diana standing&#xD;
there.&#xD;
"Why Diana! so early in the morning? how pale you&#xD;
are! come in and sit down !" she led her friend to a sofa,&#xD;
turning pale herself as the shock of' her suffering smote&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Are we alone ?" whispered the visitor.&#xD;
"Yes! I will tell Bel to remain in the bedroom, or go&#xD;
down to breakfast without me, if you wish."&#xD;
Diana nodded: when Amy returned to her, she took her&#xD;
hand witha wringing pressure, and looked into her eyes.&#xD;
speechlessly, ere she covered her face and broke into passion,&#xD;
ate sobs. "I am the most besotted fool upon this eai'th !"&#xD;
she cried out at last. "Tell me what to do, and I will do&#xD;
it, though I die."&#xD;
Amy regarded her wonderingly; she kissed her, and then&#xD;

stroked her hair in silence, for she had drawn her head upon&#xD;
her bosom, as ~he ceased her weeping.&#xD;
"Marcus has left me, Amy ! You predicted it-tell me&#xD;
how to bring him back !" she related the cii'cum~tances of&#xD;
their parting.&#xD;
" XYhere is he, dear ?"&#xD;
"lie sailed for Europe yesterday-there is a strange&#xD;
cruelty and hardness in him, or he could not have done it."&#xD;
"Not that perhaps altogether," said Amy, " his judg-&#xD;
mnent has led him to believe that you iixe a coquette to , t~he&#xD;
very centre-he thinks it would peril his future, rest to yield&#xD;
to his feelings now, but it is all in your power to bring him&#xD;
back, if you will-I can see a straight way out of your&#xD;
trouble !"&#xD;
how? how ?"&#xD;
"First resolve in God's strength, not your own, to resign&#xD;
nih your coquettish tendexicies. Resolve to conquer in every&#xD;
little temptation: we women understand this, Diana-you&#xD;
know with ~ fullness of knowledge that you can turn to Mr.&#xD;
Leonard wholly, or not, 'as you will-if you are willing, to&#xD;
do it, he will joyfully return to you-if you yield to your&#xD;
proclivities for interesting every gentleman within your&#xD;
reach, you must live on such miserable husks as such pas-&#xD;
time affords-"&#xD;
"But I will return to him alone."&#xD;
"So you have said before, my dear, but in ,a week the&#xD;
purpose has been forgotten,-and a new masculine face has&#xD;
only suggested the idea of a new victim."&#xD;

"Q what ~id God make .me in this way for ?" groaned&#xD;
Diana, with a solemnity of regret~ that caused a smile to&#xD;
shine across Amy's lip a moment--it was so strange to see&#xD;
the madcap in grief. "Amy, I don't care that," she snapt&#xD;
her finger, "for any mixn on earth but Marcus Leonard.-I&#xD;
wish all the rest were in the bottom of the sea. 'But tell&#xD;
me what to do !" she looked up with keen anxiety into her&#xD;
companion's face.&#xD;
"Write to him, and tell him you have been to blame,&#xD;
that you repent and ask his forgiveness, and will try hence-&#xD;
forth to be-to be more thoughtful. Thoughtful is the word&#xD;
isn't it? it isn't quite as humble as saying you wil ~ry to&#xD;
be worthy of him."&#xD;
"It is too hard--too hard so !" answered the proud girl,&#xD;
slowly shaking her head. "Is there no other way? Advise&#xD;
Agnes to write that she believes I still love him, and that he&#xD;
has been hasty-cruei----let her tell him that I am i~npulsivc&#xD;
but faithfuL 0, do this for me, Amy, and I will love you&#xD;
to the last day of my life t"&#xD;
"This is too hard for me, dear Diana! You know bow&#xD;
willingly I would serve you-but knowing your temperament&#xD;
-knowing above all, that you do not draw your strength&#xD;
from the Divine ]3eing, I dar~ not, as it xvcrc, promise that&#xD;
your future life will be different-you ar~ the one to make&#xD;
both the resolve and the written promise. You will be&#xD;
happier and better for having acknowledged your fault.&#xD;
Mr. Leonard has the right to expect it from you before he&#xD;
returns to you-it is not treating him well, to have in-&#xD;
jured him, and then to ask him to make the first advances."&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have not injured him. Hundreds of men would have&#xD;
thought nothing about my little flirting ways."&#xD;
"Do you really think so, Diana ?"&#xD;
"They would not. have taken the matter so seriously:&#xD;
they would have hastened the wedding, if they could have&#xD;
done so."&#xD;
"That would have been because they were less far-seeing&#xD;
as to consequences: Mr. Leonard not only desires to possess&#xD;
you, but he desires to possess a heart that reflects his own,&#xD;
purposes, aspirations and affections."&#xD;
"You seem to know a great deal about his aspirations."&#xD;
"Not a great deal !-I never spoke with him except to ex-&#xD;
change the compliments of the day, but I read his character&#xD;
from many. little incidents which Agnes has told me. He&#xD;
has always been too much occupied with you, to notice other&#xD;
young ladies."      /&#xD;
"0, Amy, if I could write to him !" Diana wrung her&#xD;
hands in lamentation over her stubborn pride.&#xD;
"You can! you know you can! You said you would do&#xD;
as I advised-don't be so blind, so mad as to destroy your&#xD;
happiness: I believe it ought to be secured at any honorable&#xD;
priee-.--you may thin it will come again in s~me shape, if&#xD;
you let it go now, bu it may not."&#xD;
"Do you think he 'ill ever write to me&#xD;
"Agnes says he is very determined when he has once&#xD;
made up his mind on any matter."&#xD;
"0 !" murmured the miserable girl weeping bitterly. "I&#xD;
wish I had die&amp;amp;---'I wish I were dead this moment !"&#xD;
"Now, dear Diana, how absol~e~ly foolish you are !-.~&#xD;

A deep carnation suffused Diana's pale cheek; her eyes&#xD;
shone proudly thro gh her tears. "If a lover of yours had&#xD;

This was a home-question; An~iy wished to r~st6rc&#xD;

evasively. " I think when I commit a fault, it relieves inc&#xD;

"I cannot confess mine. I was so wretched, I thought&#xD;
you could show me some hope that I could make a Mailable."&#xD;
She looked so truly miserable as she spoke, and so determin-&#xD;

farther, so she tried to comfort her.&#xD;
"J dare say he'll write to you, dear. Have a little&#xD;
patience !-he perhaps will see that he was too abrupt and&#xD;
severe-he will learn how deeply he loved you by being ab-&#xD;
sent from. you: it is far better for him to know that he can-&#xD;
not reach you when he will, because that will make him&#xD;
'groan in spirit' at the separation, so you must try to be&#xD;

"I Would acknowledge all my folly-all! I woul d~ be so&#xD;

Diana's head was resting like a wearied child's on Amy's&#xD;

"You would be such a delightful girl, if you would only&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
"You are going to Mrs. Ashley's to-morrow afternoon, I&#xD;
suppose, Amny-you and Isabel !" said Mr. Second.&#xD;
"Yes, sir! she says in the note that she will have no com-&#xD;
pany-only Agnes and Mrs2 Collins will be there !"&#xD;
"1 will meet you theme at tea!"&#xD;
"Well, sir, that will be right. I should be glad' if we&#xD;
could leave quite early !"&#xD;
"Why ?"&#xD;
She 6olored, and then replied, ~' 'We ~xpect a friend to&#xD;
spend the evening with us at home 1"&#xD;
"Who is that, Amy ?"&#xD;
"Dr. Kendrick is' going to bring us some minerals to&#xD;
examine !"&#xD;
"I think it would be a good plan for Dr. Kendrick to&#xD;
stay at home !" Mr. Second said with a smile, but there was&#xD;
an under current to it that showed he was not jesting.&#xD;
"Why, sir ?" asked Amy, gravely; catching his real feeb&#xD;
ings~ she found it impossible to appear as if' she did not&#xD;
under4~and them. Mr. Second had stood with his hand on&#xD;
&#xD;
the door ready for departure, but observing her expression,&#xD;
he took her hand and led her to the sofa from which they&#xD;
had risen a moment before: they were alone.&#xD;
"Jt will not do for IsabQl to ~become interested in this&#xD;

young man.&#xD;
"She has, never said that she was, sir-nor has he profess.&#xD;
ed an interest in her."&#xD;
"Yet it exists on both sides !"&#xD;
"Is there any harm in that. sir? he is very good and&#xD;
honorable !"&#xD;
"Amy, do you never mean to drop the ~ir in speaking to&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir !"&#xD;
"There it is again !"&#xD;
"I will drop it!"&#xD;
"Well, don't look so convicted of impropriety; it is time&#xD;
that you had got acquainted with your privilege of flimiliar-&#xD;
ty." He held her hand; she did not withdraw it, although it&#xD;
lay like a dead and passionless thing in his clasp. "You&#xD;
must use your influencewith Isabel, and oblige this young&#xD;
man to stop his visits."&#xD;
I ought to know why !"&#xD;
ttle girl  are!~ If you will&#xD;
"What an unsophisticated li     you&#xD;
reflect, you will see that Isabel as the sister of my wife will&#xD;
be~ble to make a much more advantageous match."&#xD;
"But you did not seek an advantageous match, when you&#xD;
chose me."&#xD;
"I could afford to follow my heart, this young man cannot !"&#xD;

"May not they decide whether they would prefer each&#xD;
other with poverty, to ethers with wealth ?"&#xD;
"No!"&#xD;
Amy looked up as the calrii "no '~ wa s pronounced: it&#xD;
was singularly decisive in its freedom from excitement.&#xD;
"You see, Amy, these young people are full of romantic&#xD;
notions, and it will not do for them to act upon them: it is&#xD;
your duty to guard Isabel from an intimacy with Dr. Ken-&#xD;
drick, I rely upon you! your gratitude to me should insure&#xD;
compliance with my wishes."&#xD;
She had sacrificed her heart to gratitude, but it was too&#xD;
vast a tax upon it, to ask her to break away the tendrils of&#xD;
her young sister's love from a worthy object: she saw her-&#xD;
self entering upon a field where heP will and Jsabel  were&#xD;
always to be subservient: not one act alone, but a life of acts&#xD;
would be demanded by Mr. Second as payment for her&#xD;
debt. But she had learned to love luxury, and to hate the&#xD;
toilsome life which she had once led--she looked with dread&#xD;
at the idea of being launched again into the ocean of poverty&#xD;
and barrenness, and struggle-she was not yet goaded to&#xD;
the last extremity. Mr. Scored loved her; she had not&#xD;
sufficient power to wring hk spirit. She sat in' silence, and&#xD;
pleaded to heaven to have a way opened before her; she re-&#xD;
solved to make an appeal.&#xD;
"You love me ?" she asked, looking in his face with&#xD;
trembling lips: she clasped both his handy in her slender&#xD;
~ uger~ with entreaty.&#xD;
"Love you, sweetest? my every deed shows it !" he fold-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed her close to his breast, and for the first time she laid her&#xD;
head upon it a moment, while she wept.&#xD;
"0, do not ask inc to interfere with Dr. Kendrick and&#xD;
Bel ! don't!"&#xD;
"We woift talk of this now, dear, if it distresses you!&#xD;
there! don't cry!"&#xD;
"I am not crying now !" she raised herself'. "I pant&#xD;
you to think about this !-do, for my sake. If they care for&#xD;
each other, l~t them be happy."&#xD;
"But, my dear, it will not guarantee their happiness to&#xD;
let them rush into all sorts of straits-the doctor is exces-&#xD;
sively poor! poor to starvation! and it is not honorable in&#xD;
him to seek a wife."&#xD;
"But he is not seeking a wife :-I think he has no idea of&#xD;
reducing Bel to starvation, and I am sure he would not ask&#xD;
her hand, if he had not means to support her. What harm&#xD;
is there in their being friends for years, and then marrying,&#xD;
if he is able? Bel don't thiiik of such a thing as being any-&#xD;
body's wife at present."&#xD;
"You don't understand him: he is deep, I can assure you.&#xD;
lie knows if he marries Isabel, I would not let them live&#xD;
discredi~tably: he counts upon help from me&#xD;
There caine upon Amy's heart a tide of repulsion: it did&#xD;
not lessen, when Mr. Second said, "I think, Amy, that the&#xD;
wealth which will surround you, should make you consider-&#xD;
ate in wishing Isabel similarly circumstances: it will be for&#xD;
your interest to have the past obliterated from people's&#xD;

&#xD;
minds, and if your sister should live in a narrow way&#xD;
people would naturally ask about-" he hesitated.&#xD;
A deep scarlet flamed in her cheek: her tongue was dip-&#xD;
pod in scorn as she replied. "I am not able to discover but&#xD;
what I have occasion for pride in my antecedents; poverty&#xD;
is an accident, but mental and moral wealth are the gifts of&#xD;
God; my early life was not passed aloof from these."&#xD;
"Certainly not, aiid it was the marks of these, together&#xD;
with your air of refinement and beauty that attracted me to&#xD;
you as a suitable wife."&#xD;
"I used to think you did not care for tl~e eclat of&#xD;
wealth !"&#xD;
"On the contrary, no man cares more for it: I value&#xD;
wealth for what it can do. It gives a' man power to please&#xD;
himself-and a woman too."&#xD;
"Have you granted my petition ?"&#xD;
"What's that? oh !"&#xD;
"You will, wont you! make mc happy by not asking me&#xD;
to pain Isabel. You said 'once that your happiness was&#xD;
mine !"&#xD;
"My dear child, you are too inexperienced to judge in&#xD;
this matter. Manifest your love for me, and your confidence&#xD;
in my judgment by doing as I wish."&#xD;
"But suppose my will is as dear to me, as yours is to von&#xD;
-what shall we do-?" Amy looked up as if she were put-&#xD;
ting a very serious question. ,&#xD;
Mr. Second smiled, then "he' ha'd" as if impelled to the&#xD;
irresistible discharge of mirth: the idea of that pretty little&#xD;

AMY   DENBROOK.                  165&#xD;
girs will crossing his own after she was his, was unique:&#xD;
he patted her under her, chin, and said, "I think we shall&#xD;
get along first rate, Amy! who could resist such a little'&#xD;
witch as you ?"&#xD;
"Then you consent ?"&#xD;
"No! no! Do you refuse to do as I ask, Amy ?"&#xD;
"I am afraid I do !" she responded with a deprecating&#xD;
look at him.&#xD;
"You do?"&#xD;
She lowered her eyes in silence, and began to cry. Mr.,&#xD;
Scored would melt at this she knew-but she did not know&#xD;
that the transitory s')ftness would not affect his purpose in&#xD;
the least; however she would not be comforted, she would&#xD;
not allow her hands to be taken down from her face; she&#xD;
would not allow her erect position against the sofa-back to&#xD;
be altered.&#xD;
"Don't feel so badly, Amy !"&#xD;
4&#xD;
" You make' me&#xD;
"Not willingly, I am sure I"&#xD;
"Yes, you do 1"&#xD;
"But, my love, you are unreasonable: we will let the&#xD;
subject go. There! dry your tears, aud bid me 'Good&#xD;
Night !'&#xD;
Good night !" she answered, sitting still with hei~ hands&#xD;
yet over her face. lie kissed a little spot on her forehead,&#xD;
and repeating, "Good bye, pet,"' and left her.&#xD;
She uncovered her face and listened to his retreating&#xD;
step, then she laid her head on the arm of the sofa, sighing,&#xD;

"Jt is'nt the kind of love I want !-I can't comprehend it-it&#xD;
seeks his will, and not my happiness."&#xD;
The next day she did not tell her sister of the conversation&#xD;
about Dr. Kendrick: she desired that she should still con-&#xD;
sider herself a little school-girl, and should not trouble her&#xD;
head about the possible event of being married some day:&#xD;
more Vhan this, she was ashamed to say that the sentiments&#xD;
of her betrothed lover were not generous. Th~e they started&#xD;
for school, she said abruptly, "Del, I have no idea that we&#xD;
shall return early from Mrs. Ashley's; suppose we stopia&#xD;
at the doctor's office, and ask him to come to-morrow even-&#xD;
ing, instead of this evenino'"&#xD;
"Dear ! will we have to spend the whole evening at Mrs.&#xD;
Ashley's ?"&#xD;
"I suppose so! and if we did not, you know I could riot&#xD;
look much at the minerals, for Mr. Second would be here,&#xD;
and I should be occupied with him: he and the doctor are so&#xD;
stately to each other, we could not expect it to be pleasant."&#xD;
"That's true! well! we 'II stop at the office."&#xD;
They accordingly stopt at the office, and met Dr. Ken-&#xD;
drick's smile: it seemed to come from some deep well ~bf&#xD;
brightness; his writing was scattered over the table, yet&#xD;
there was a method in the, various piles of letter paper; un-&#xD;
consciously, there was in Amy's manner, a sisterly frank-&#xD;
ness; and Isabel was as gay as a sunbeam. They stayed&#xD;
but five minutes: when they had gone, the doctor remarked&#xD;
mentally.-&#xD;
"Yes! Amy understands my hopes, although she does not;&#xD;

&#xD;
my poverty is not the greatest sin of which a man ~an be&#xD;
guilty in their eyes, although it may be in the estirna~ion of&#xD;
Amy's proud lover: how did it ever happen that she 'should&#xD;
~ngage herself to him? she does not seem mercenary'! I am&#xD;
at last in the narrow road that leads to modest sUccess,&#xD;
sweet Isabel! To-rn ~rrow evening! heaven bless her sunny&#xD;

In the afternoon, when the sisters went to Mrs. Ashley's,&#xD;
they were met by Agnes Leonard, who conducted them to&#xD;
her chamber.&#xD;
"There is really a wonderful woman dwn stairs, girls,"&#xD;
she said enthusiastically, as she folded B il's shawl, and laid&#xD;
it on the b~d, "such a scope of intellect 1! such insio'ht into&#xD;
human nature I never saw ! she has told me of things I have&#xD;
only dreamed of in myself! she seems to understand every&#xD;
want of mind and heart. I am completely captivated by&#xD;
her, and she manif't~sts a deep interest in me."&#xD;
"What is her name ?" questioned Amy, with eager grati-&#xD;
fication in her looks. "I am all impatience to see her.&#xD;
Pray help me with this rebellious knot !"&#xD;
Agnes beset the bonnet strings, and replied a~ she un-&#xD;
fastened the knot. "She is a widow-her name is Collins."&#xD;
"0, yes! I was introduced to her the other day, but it&#xD;
was nearly dark at the time."&#xD;
"You may not be pleased with1 her at-'first sight! I was&#xD;
not! but now I think she is the most fascinating being Lever&#xD;
met, and she is not handsome either-not even pretty."&#xD;
"How old is she ?" inquired Isabel.&#xD;

"About thirty! she is going to spend the winter here.&#xD;
She is from Philadelphia !"&#xD;
"I hope she'll like us, don't you, Amy ?" said Bel.&#xD;
"Of course I do !"&#xD;
"She is prepared to like you; she said you called the&#xD;
other evening, Amy, and that she 'was delighted with the&#xD;
little she saw of you !"&#xD;
"0, indeed !" exclaime~ Amy, a little surprised, not~ rcA-&#xD;
membering that she had a peered unlike ten thousand y~.ing&#xD;
ladies might have appear d, in making a formal call at twi-&#xD;
light.&#xD;
The three fair girls went down into the parlor, where&#xD;
Mrs. Ashley welcomed them with an: air of friendliness.&#xD;
Mrs. Collins was kind, but a little reserved; she evidently&#xD;
listened to every remark that drop~ from Amy with atten-&#xD;
tion. Once the young girl raised her eyes to have a good&#xD;
look at the wonderful lady, whose countenance was tranquil&#xD;
and expressionless, until she darted an intensely bright&#xD;
glance upon her; it seemed blazing with infernal fire, capa-&#xD;
ble of burning though every impediment in its search for&#xD;
mdtive-life: it impressed Amy mast powerfully and disa-&#xD;
greeably, although it was withdrawn with a smile. The un-&#xD;
pleasant sensationwore oW when Mrs. Collins said frankly,&#xD;
and with an air of interest, "This is the friend @f whom&#xD;
you have spoken, Agnes "-she believed in calling young girls&#xD;
by their christian names. I am glad to believe, my dear,&#xD;
that you are not a sample of a class who live after general&#xD;
rules, and never seek to develope their own individuality: 1&#xD;
&#xD;
bAiove you are one of the few fitted for a higher life." Be-&#xD;
fore Mrs. Collins said this she had ascertained that Mrs.&#xD;
A8hle.y was absent: she played a different role in her&#xD;
presence.&#xD;
Amy smiled: it did seem rather gratifying to be so high-&#xD;
ly esteemed by such a gifted person: but the higher life,&#xD;
what did she mean by that? and why should she try to de-&#xD;
velope her individuality, when it developed itself Past&#xD;
enough for her comfort?&#xD;
"What do you understand by a higher life, Mrs. Collins ?~'&#xD;
she asked a little timidly: the expression rather charmed&#xD;
her after all, and she was pleased that her new acquaintance&#xD;
said something ~uggestive immediately, instead of wasting&#xD;
time on the weather and the gay world.&#xD;
"I simply mean that every person should act as he or she&#xD;
feels: I mean th4t perfect f~anknes~ should characterise the&#xD;
intercourse of rational beings-I mean that we should dis-&#xD;
card all bonds-the bonds of conventionalism, of fashion, of&#xD;
ungenial acquaint~nce-it~ fact I mean that the inner life&#xD;
should never be a lie to the outer life: there should be har~&#xD;
mony all through-thought and speech should act as one, the&#xD;
latter should always clothe the former truthfully."&#xD;
"We can only live thus in heaven !" responded Amy, as&#xD;
a heavy shadow gathered oVer her. "We should make&#xD;
C&#xD;
people unhappy if we always expressed ourselves as we&#xD;
felt."&#xD;
" We should not seek to live with friends who Will not&#xD;

"You say, Mrs. Collins, that we must act as we feel---we&#xD;
do not always feel rightly."&#xD;
"You are correct, my friend-but we n~st be pure wit L~-&#xD;
in: there must always be a few brave spirits to inaugurate a&#xD;

will not forgive us for thus wronging ourselves; we lo~se&#xD;
half the glory that is stored up within us if we do not give&#xD;
the key of our spirit-life to the true magician." Mrs. Col-&#xD;
Jins looked around and saw that Mrs. Ashley was still ab-&#xD;
sent frdm the room. "You have seen the evil that arises&#xD;
from want of congeniality in this family. Agnes: we will&#xD;
leave friendship, and' speak of love, as both are governed by&#xD;
similar principles. Mr. and Mrs. Ashley are a wretched&#xD;
pair, although in each there are elements of a glorious life:&#xD;
each acts upon. the other di~astrously."&#xD;
"Not necessarily !" said Amy, she received a slight&#xD;
shock at this discussing the private affairs of her host and&#xD;
&#xD;
hostess: she believed that Mrs~ Collins' frankness was con-.&#xD;
sistent with her principles, but it made her uneasy: she&#xD;
guessed that Mrs. Ashley or Agnes might naturally have&#xD;
spoken of her engagement, and she dreaded lest Mrs. Col-&#xD;
lins should deem it her duty to talk with her about it, and&#xD;
ask her if she lqved Mr. Second beyond all the world; she&#xD;
felt as if taken possession of by her powerful will: she felt&#xD;
as if the strong woman could read her through in time, and&#xD;
as if the study would be ruthlessly undertaken.&#xD;
"I think people can get along well enough, if they are&#xD;
disposed to," she added after a brief pause. "If the two&#xD;
you have spoken of~ should become sincere christians', much&#xD;
of their trouble would vanish."&#xD;
"My dear," Mrs. Collins laid her hand upon Amy's&#xD;
arm, "I reverence christianity a~ much as you do, but do&#xD;
not igflore the very constitution of your mind !-the Creator&#xD;
made us for happiness-all the misery in the world arises&#xD;
from our not obeying His laws: I grant that the two we&#xD;
speak df sinned innocently-they supposed they could be to&#xD;
each other w~hat time has proved that they ~cannot; now&#xD;
that they have discovered their error, it is a lie for them to&#xD;
live together, and pretend to the world that they are mar-&#xD;
ried, when they are in truth divorced by the laws of nature&#xD;
and of~spirit: to be holy and truthful they should part, and&#xD;
each should~seek the one with whom there is a real affinity !"&#xD;
"Suppose they should seek and should not find, as mil-&#xD;
lions have done before them ?" returned Amy, with a very&#xD;

slight curl of her red lip: the uneasiness within amounted&#xD;
almost to anguish.&#xD;
"Those who are in earnest always do find !"&#xD;
"Or thi~dc they do !"&#xD;
"You are incredulous !" said Mrs. Collins, with a singular&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"Bel, hand me the scissors !" demanded Amy, abruptly.&#xD;
The smile of Mrs. Collins deepened as she bent over her&#xD;
work and then it disappeared: she augured well from the&#xD;
young girl's impatient tone : she had stirred up the warfare&#xD;
in her breast: she had set the match .to the train of&#xD;
smothered thoughts: from Agnes she had learned enough&#xD;
of Amy's character to know what must be the state of&#xD;
things between her and Mr. Second.&#xD;
"I should think that those who are not married, Mrs.&#xD;
Collins," said Bel, " would learn to be very Qareful how&#xD;
they step into the noose, if they calculated to step out&#xD;
again, if it didn't fit."&#xD;
~ That is a very sensible remark. A.n unwedded person&#xD;
cannot be too careful: it is a misfortune when married per-&#xD;
sons are surprised at their want of congenialIty, but it is a&#xD;
crime in single persons to enter so holy a state, knowing&#xD;
that God hath not joined theni together."&#xD;
The fire burned at Amy's heart-burned to its centre.&#xD;
At this moment, Mr. Scored entered. "God hath not join-&#xD;
ed us together !" were the words that sprang up in her soul:&#xD;
she greeted him with a bow, and a hastily uttei~ed "Good&#xD;
evening!" lie noticed that sh~ did not smile, and he a~tribut-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed it to the pet of the evening before: the other ladies were&#xD;
social and lively: Mrs. Collins displayed a new side of her&#xD;
character: she was humorous, gentle and fascinating; there&#xD;
was not the least trace of the solemn earnestness that had&#xD;
characterized her a few moments previous. When Mr. and&#xD;
M rs.~ Ashley had jofried the circle with their children, Mr.&#xD;
Second rose with the word "Amy !" and j~roceeded to the&#xD;
distant end of theapartment where the piano stoQd: she&#xD;
followed him.&#xD;
"Let me look at the bracelet you have on, my dear !"&#xD;
She pushed back her flowing sleeve a little, and showed&#xD;
his gift which eneit~cled her arm just above her wrist Next&#xD;
it, he clasped a new diamond bracelet, or began to do so,&#xD;
ere she guessed what he was about.&#xD;
"No !" she uttered, laying her hand upon it to hinder&#xD;
the fastening. "This is all I can wear~! I thank you, but I&#xD;
would rather not take it !"&#xD;
"Are you angry still, Amy? this is childish! hold out&#xD;
your arm&#xD;
She held it out, unfastened the cameo circlet herself and&#xD;
laid it on the piano while he waited-then she pushed away&#xD;
the hand that held the other, toward the old one.&#xD;
"What do you mean ?" he questioned with a frown.&#xD;
"I don't want either! You intend to buy my consent to&#xD;
interfere with Dr. Kendrick." She xvas~ultimating Mrs. Cob&#xD;
lins' ideas of frankness.&#xD;
He set his teeth together hard: after some reflection, he&#xD;
looked upon her downcast face and slightly trern-bling form;&#xD;

&#xD;
there was grief in her countenance; her folded arms un~&#xD;
clasped that she might brush away a tear.&#xD;
"Amy !" he said softly.&#xD;
She looked at him, and saw only gentleness in his face;&#xD;
a sudden dread of losing her, had darted into his mind,&#xD;
bringing up all his love, and enhancing her peerlessness: he&#xD;
remembered th~it George Coleman was rich uo~v, he had pre-&#xD;
vailed on her to tell him who it was that she had loved: he&#xD;
resolved to speak no more about anything that could trouble&#xD;
her until after they wei'e married.&#xD;
"0 you are passionate Amy. J love you in spite of'&#xD;
this cruelty, but you mistake me greatly, if' you suppose I&#xD;
can insist upon anything that causes you real unhappiness-&#xD;
I will give up my wish. My very life is centered in you; do&#xD;
not wound~ me so carelessly-it is no light thing to hold my&#xD;
happb:iess at your mercy."&#xD;
"Forgive me !" she besought, conquered by his forbear-&#xD;
* ance toward her.&#xD;
"Shall I put on the bracelets ?" he asked;&#xD;
She laid her snowy arm upon the piano, and he clasped&#xD;
on her fetters; he looked with a smile upon his work when&#xD;
it ~vas done, and then turned over the betrothal ring on her&#xD;
finger:, she, felt as if the costly gems were all badges of&#xD;
her servitude: and yet his love and kindness had soothed&#xD;
the pain that had arisen in her heart.&#xD;
La e in the evening' the two girls ascended to Agnes' room&#xD;
to g4 ready for their short walk home.&#xD;
"II~Iow do you like Mrs. Collins ?" demanded Agnes.&#xD;
&#xD;
"She is an original woman, and can make herself very&#xD;
fascinating," answered Amy to whom the question was ad-&#xD;
dressed.&#xD;
"But her ideas, they startled me at first, but don't you&#xD;
think she is correct ?"&#xD;
"Partly, perhaps !"&#xD;
"0, Amy, how much I have thought of you for a long&#xD;
time, and I have not dared to utter my sentiments on your&#xD;
approaching marriage, but it seems a duty now. I know&#xD;
too well that you are not going to marry for love-i know&#xD;
that Mr. Scored is not such a person as you would choose."&#xD;
"You have not gained your supposed knowledge from my&#xD;
lips, Agnes. Leave me free to act as I wish."&#xD;
"Certainly, dear, but we have loved each other so well, I&#xD;
felt as if' I had a~ right to speak."&#xD;
"You have 1" murmured Amy, clasping her in her arms&#xD;
and kissing her lips, " but do not !"&#xD;
When Agnes retired to her room for the night, Mi's. Cob&#xD;
lins tapped at her door, and entering at the same moment,&#xD;
exclaimed, "Agnes dear, can you lend me a towel? the ser-&#xD;
Vant has forgotten them today !" Mrs. Collins often&#xD;
sought Agnes for private' colloquies.&#xD;
"Sit down, Mrs. Collins, I'll give you one in a moment !"&#xD;
The lady carelessly seated herself' on the bed.~" What&#xD;
beautiful hair you have, Agnes, when it is unbound! why do&#xD;
you always wear \t plain?"&#xD;
"It suits my style, I think " returned Agnes, with a&#xD;

WH]~N Mrs. Collins returned to her chamber, she stood be-&#xD;

head-when she stood alone at the window, none but my-&#xD;
self saw the scornful curve of her lips! who did she scorn'?&#xD;
herself or him? and yet when ~he did speak with him, there&#xD;
was a singular kindness in l~er tone-a passionate regret in&#xD;
her eyes! It is this that I fear! her benevolence and his&#xD;
wealth, which will save her from a hard life, may master me&#xD;

twice her age, and yet he is' enslaved by her every cap nec!&#xD;
I never thought this of Justin Secord--I believe the most&#xD;
prosaic men becomes the greatest fools in such matters~&#xD;
he is one who never gives up his will to any one !-he, would&#xD;
tire of her if she could be easily won-if she manifested fond-&#xD;
ness to any degree, he would thrust his foot upon her heart.&#xD;
I care nothing about winning his love, except as a means of&#xD;
winning his wealth-and this must have, yes, and I will&#xD;
have it. I have a great deal of artillery yet-she asked tue&#xD;
to visit her with Agnes-she desires to understand 'me&#xD;
I&#xD;
yet shrinks from hearing what say. It is a glorious&#xD;
thing to make slaves of men and women-and they&#xD;
are all my slaves in a measure: Mr. Ashley, in the&#xD;
silent den of his thought, boils over with a mad desire&#xD;
to cast his wife to-Well-I won't say . where to-~-&#xD;
and she, the red hot fires of passion seethe on him&#xD;
often. But better than all, Agnes is slowly coming under&#xD;
my magnetism-there is an intense enthusiasm under her&#xD;
calm exterior-fate throws me kindlings-sh~ pities Mr.&#xD;
Ashley-she could 'brave the worl~i, ~nd the higher the fire&#xD;
of her enthusiasm rises, the greater will be her influence&#xD;
over Amy, so let matters take their course: I care not&#xD;
what is consumed, so that the tie between that girl and Sc.&#xD;
cord is consumed with the rest. Ashley fancies Agnes-she&#xD;
don't understand it-she 'is innocent, and thinks that she is&#xD;
doing him good becausQ he listens to her pure sentiments&#xD;
with de1ep attention~! Bah! if they were uttered by an ugly&#xD;
old man in the pulpit, he couldn't keep his seat under their&#xD;
&#xD;
tediousness: she thinks he is a good atid suffering man!&#xD;
Pish! I help her in the opinion!, but if ~he knew as much of&#xD;
men as I do, she'd believe their assertions with allowance.&#xD;
A man like him pure! Ha! She little thinks that I hold&#xD;
her in my hand !-when I praise her intellect, (and she is&#xD;
an uncomm~m girl,) she little thinks that I am guiding it to&#xD;
results that may startle he~~ friends-she is cut out for a&#xD;
inartyr-she has bravery enough for it. Well! let her&#xD;
think she is one-let her be baptised in the fiery flood of&#xD;
condemnation for the truth's sake-The word' truth strikes&#xD;
a note in her life-h4manity! holiness! bravery! these&#xD;
help me. I got that .n~oney out of her adroitly, by pictur-&#xD;
ing the poverty of my gifted friend. I hould be rather un.&#xD;
willing that she should discover that y touching letter&#xD;
enclosing the funds, still lay in my draw r. I'll burn it! the&#xD;
fire is not extinguished. Thirty dollars !" the lady's white&#xD;
fingei~s opened the bureau drawer and passed amid the&#xD;
money. "This will keep me awhile! ere are those taw-&#xD;
dry swiss muslin aprons I am stitching with colors for the&#xD;
servants, to show my practical benevolence !-~--my desire to&#xD;
promote happiness !" she turned over the pile of work with&#xD;
a derisive smile. "The world is full of fools! Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Ashley do not siispect the vkws I am putting in Agnes'&#xD;
head: yes, she is my ally in cutting Amy Denbrook's&#xD;
chains."&#xD;
Mrs. Ashley had for years made it a point to be as dis-&#xD;
agreeable to her husband as possible-he had a kind heart,&#xD;
~hc had not; but a kind heart is a poor protection from&#xD;

n~any evil passions; it is not always protection from the&#xD;
exercise of cruelty. The gall in the wife's composition was&#xD;
distributed as freely as ever after Agnes became a gijest at&#xD;
her house-it was in fact intensified, although the lady was&#xD;
often lively, and always agreeable to her guests.-sWe visited&#xD;
her husband with sarcasm, with undisguised contempt in the&#xD;
very presence of Agnes, until her cheeks burned with dis-&#xD;
tress and shame, and pity for the object of this wrath be-&#xD;
came a present and powerful emotion: it lent a humid&#xD;
sweetness to her eyes as she spoke with him-'--it toned her&#xD;
voice to the gentlest cadence-it made her hasten uncon-&#xD;
sciously t&amp;amp; get his mislaid papor-and sometimes when they&#xD;
were ~lone it gave to her Words a bearing that was all the&#xD;
more appreciated fur her reserve of expression. Perceiving&#xD;
the effect which his persecution had upun the lovely girl, he&#xD;
quite rejoiced in it-that is in secret: he rather withered in&#xD;
public under her eye. It chanced occasionally that Mi's.&#xD;
Ashley would be away from home at twilight: if her hus-&#xD;
band came in, Mrs. Collins always had some excuse for&#xD;
leaving him alone with Agnes: he read beautifully, and then&#xD;
in a voice rich with expression he would give forth the&#xD;
thoughts of the great and gifted: if perchance, there was&#xD;
aught in the reading that touched upon his own lot, the sud~&#xD;
denly deepened tone brought an unbidden tear to the clear&#xD;
eye of hi~ auditor: he never spoke directly upon his domes.&#xD;
tic trials, but sometimes he uttered sad words that could&#xD;
only come from such a source: then from the lips of Agnes&#xD;
flowed a soft and earnest consolation, a timid entreaty that&#xD;
&#xD;
he would look higher than earth for his joys. When they&#xD;
parted after' such conversations, he smiled in triumph; she&#xD;
knelt at her white bed and poured forth to the Creator her&#xD;
appeal that he would bend down with his rich grace to the&#xD;
disappointed one-and she saw no tempter nigh, although&#xD;
she realized that her voice and look were those of an angel&#xD;
to the world-weary man: she had trulyrnoved his better&#xD;
nature somewhat, but alas! it was far off and he had his&#xD;
being in the earth rather than the heaven of his spirit.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
IT was six months from the hour of Mareus Leonard's part-&#xD;
ing with Diana Blake. During two. or three months she&#xD;
had looked with a sickening impatience for a letter frpm&#xD;
him: each day it had seemed as if the merciful sun could&#xD;
not go down without lending her light to read such words as&#xD;
she panted to decipher. But no letter came; the subdued&#xD;
manner and pale ~heeks that had revealed the strength of&#xD;
her suffering, gradually disappeared under the effect of pride&#xD;
-she could not suffer for naught--she rushed into the field&#xD;
as a coquette with all the reckless energy of her character-&#xD;
she devoted every talent and grace that had been bestowed&#xD;
upon her to wreaking upon other hearts such pangs as she&#xD;
had known.-...it was a bitter pleasure to wring the spirits&#xD;
of those whom she judged incapable of suffering long-&#xD;
Leonard could not have suffered long, or he would have re-&#xD;
turned to her. Her small feet trod upon human hearts with&#xD;
an impious nonchalance: she looked to see if perchance an-&#xD;
other could be found to rivet her affections as het' proud&#xD;
lover had done, but she hoped in vain, and dashed away the&#xD;
&#xD;
importuning effects that would not seem like his. Often she&#xD;
walked her chamber until daybreak, filled withself-reproach&#xD;
as she reviewed her conduct under the solemn fall of the&#xD;
night season; she sent agonised cries over the ocean, and&#xD;
prayed to Marcus as to one who could ~alone win her to&#xD;
peace and goodness; but with the next evening, she invoked&#xD;
a different set of feelings; she stood before her mirror&#xD;
radiantly robed; prepared for her insane crusade against&#xD;
those who, were hapless enough to love her: she was not&#xD;
all heartless therefore her course of life held her always&#xD;
balancing between gratified vanity and remorse: sometimes&#xD;
with a wild impulse to atone to the All-seeing, she statte(l&#xD;
from her home laden with money to bestow upon the miser-&#xD;
able: it solaced her to see the pleasure that broke over hag..&#xD;
gard countenances ;it was more soothing than the idolatrous&#xD;
rhapsodies that sought h~r ear; it convinced her that she&#xD;
was not yet too bad to walk in woman's sweet, appointed&#xD;
path-.-.-she was not ~oo bad to lift up the bowed down: after&#xD;
these rare missions she was more thoughtful about entrap-&#xD;
ping the hearts of men, for under the light of a performed&#xD;
duty, she saw how wide a field might be hers: although&#xD;
youthful, both men and women were attracted to her by a&#xD;
strong magnetism; she could elevate these, if she would:&#xD;
she could not but impress herself upon others in some way:&#xD;
she either won enthusiastic friends or' met with strong an-&#xD;
tagonism.&#xD;

Diana's looks; he waited to hear a regretful word from her;&#xD;
he had resolved not to return to her without this word, and&#xD;
to resolve was, to execute his xviii: even the letters of Agnes&#xD;
brought a little pang of disippointinent, for the small white&#xD;
envelope had given hopes that it might be from Diana, ere&#xD;
it reached his hand from the postmaster. At length these&#xD;
letters related the unprincipled coquetries into which Diana&#xD;
had thrown herself; grief had not bettered her nature, and&#xD;
Leonard gave her up completely; although his aching heart&#xD;
did not easily relax its bold up~n 'her.&#xD;
Upon his arrival in England, he had presented his letters&#xD;
of introduction; one of these brotight him in contact with&#xD;
the family of a merchant at whose country house he was a&#xD;
welcome guest: Mr. Stonehouse was a widower, and his&#xD;
establishment was under the supervision of his eldest&#xD;
daughter Margaret; she was a plain girl of twenty-eight&#xD;
perhaps, absolutely coarse in her exterior, and it was not un~&#xD;
til she spoke that her beautiful enunciations and choice lan-&#xD;
guage led one to regret that a delicate spii'it h~d been so&#xD;
rudely set; she was thoughtful, timid and secretive, living&#xD;
in the world which poets had created for her; if all the&#xD;
glory of her actual being had ,been frankly given forth&#xD;
some noble man might have loved her, for there are many&#xD;
to whom the outer vesture is riot all the woman; she felt&#xD;
keenly the unprepossessing exterior that had beei~ lent her for&#xD;
the use of her earth-life-.--the veil of flesh was hateful to hei',&#xD;
and she felt that it ~is little betrayed the spirit within, as the&#xD;
clumsy veil of the Turkish women betrays the charm of&#xD;
&#xD;
life, color and proportion in the face underneath: she w~s&#xD;
often awkward from a sense of her lack of attractiveness-&#xD;
sometimes she was a little bitter and sarcastic, but her gen-&#xD;
tlest self was lived in her quiet home-there she strove to&#xD;
be to her father and younger sister what she believed&#xD;
she could not be to, the world. There she strove to&#xD;
bestow upon her young Sylvia such sweet excellences as she&#xD;
could receive; she taught her such music as seemed fi1~ted to&#xD;
gush from her lovely lips-she pointed out ~he richest gems&#xD;
of thought in the authors which she read to her, or obliged&#xD;
her to read aloud. Sylvia was in truth lovely to look upon;&#xD;
~she gratified every sense: she was as timid as Margiixet but&#xD;
infinitely graceful in all her motions, with the rose deepening&#xD;
and retreating from her cheek at ~ word from a stranger;&#xD;
she looked as if sweetest dreams came from afar to her&#xD;
spirit, nor was the impression dispelled when her voice b~-&#xD;
trayec] in its exquisite intonLition the culture that was re-&#xD;
flected from Margaret's mind-her words were unfrequent,&#xD;
but they only made one long to learn of the rich treasures&#xD;
that seemed held too charity. It was Margaret's delight to&#xD;
arrange daily her masses of golden hair, according to her&#xD;
own taste, and when every fold of her delicately tinted dress&#xD;
.pleased her, she would quietly kiss her brow or lips, saying&#xD;
"That xviii do,' Sylvia." In her secret soul she said, "she's&#xD;
the loveliest vision ever poet looked upon !" When Sylvia&#xD;
bent over her guitar and sang her sweet song, Margaret's&#xD;
soul xvas conjuring up remembrances of heroines, and won-&#xD;
dering if any could have surpassed her sister in grace or&#xD;

beauty: we have described the young girl as she often&#xD;
seemed--as friends and acquaintance saw her; she had a&#xD;
little identical self of her owli, aside from all the cloud-like&#xD;
splendor that invested her; this Margaret understood very&#xD;
well, but the real and the apparent were frequently separate&#xD;
in her mind as she contemplated her.&#xD;
When Leonard first saw Sylvia, she broke upon his vision&#xD;
with such sweet forc~, he involuntar4y murmured to him-&#xD;
self, "I have found the unknown woman! I have found&#xD;
my own !" They met at a party which Mr, Stonehouse&#xD;
gave; Margaret could not be said to give it, for parties&#xD;
annoyed her either in the giving or the attending. Mi'.&#xD;
Leonard was not so void of good sense as to trust to his&#xD;
imagination alone in regard to the beautiful Sylvia; he re-&#xD;
treated into a corner, and artfully watched her; when he&#xD;
saw with what timid grace she strove to withdraw from the&#xD;
rapid compliments of fashionable young men, and yet how&#xD;
kind was her look and smile, he contrasted her with Diana~;&#xD;
he almost adored her7fo-r this innocent for~getfalness of the&#xD;
power of her beauty-she did not care to use it as a means&#xD;
of captivating. He sought 'an introduction to her as she&#xD;
stood by a table, where she had for a moment sheltered her-&#xD;
self; her little hand was laying like a snowflake upon a&#xD;
volum.~ of Teirnyson's poems. After a few common-place&#xD;
remarks, Mi'. Leonard asked, "What book have you there&#xD;
prisoned to its glace ?" he had been lifting up and looking&#xD;
at the titles of several.&#xD;
She named it, and turning over the leaves, pointed out&#xD;
&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
187&#xD;
&#xD;
one of his favorite poems, saying, "That is the sweetest&#xD;
song to me&#xD;
This singular a~n~ty of taste struck the young man as&#xD;
most peculiar the effect of this little incident could not&#xD;
have been undone by many seemingly contradictory phases&#xD;
of character. Almost ere he could reply, Margaret called&#xD;
her to look after the supper-table a little, and arrange the.&#xD;
lights; his next view of the fairy was when she flitted from&#xD;
guest to guest offering a dish of fruit or carrying a silver&#xD;
basket, and he remarked that her occasional directions to&#xD;
the servants were given with the same gentle, "Please,&#xD;
John," that she would have used in saying "Please, sir, let&#xD;
inc pass !"&#xD;
It is rather surprising that after one has loved and lost&#xD;
the object, instead of being faithful as we would romantical-&#xD;
ly wish, the empty heart seeks for a new idol; it may not&#xD;
supply the place of the old one, but it se~nis better th~u&#xD;
vacancy: the absolutely faithful people are rare, and de-&#xD;
serve unlimited admiration, such as they receive from those&#xD;
who cannot follow their example. Men never marry so&#xD;
abruptly as after a rejection, or a quarrel.&#xD;
The next time Marcus Leonard saw Miss Stonehouse, it&#xD;
was a beautiful afternoon in May: he had contrived some&#xD;
business that rendered it necessary for him to ride out to&#xD;
the home of h~is merchant friend. The picturesqi~e dwelling&#xD;
was halt' concealed by trees, as he approached~ it: a gable&#xD;
could be seen here, a bay window there, and a balcony yon-&#xD;
der; at all these portions of architecture, the young man.&#xD;

looked scrutinizi ngly as he dismounted from his horse: he&#xD;
was very slow in securing the animal, owing to the time oc-&#xD;
cupied in his observations; but he saw no fiUry flitting&#xD;
around; the vines that clustered about the porticoes climb-&#xD;
ed and drooped in a thousand graceful curves; he fancied&#xD;
the taste of Sylvia had directed the arrangement of these,&#xD;
and doubtless her snowy hand had often gleamed amid the&#xD;
- foliage as she gathered the flowers that were less lovely&#xD;
than herself: the trees were many of them jewelled with&#xD;
blossoms: as he entered within the gate, the short grass&#xD;
was bathed in a tender, shimmering, light; it was embellish-&#xD;
ed with bunches of golden dandelions; as he was noticing&#xD;
the effect of the~e, his eye wandered to a distance, and there&#xD;
he saw Sylvia reposing on the grass in a white dress and&#xD;
sky blue scarf: she was looking at him, with a book in&#xD;
her hand, and with some embroidery at her side, but per-&#xD;
fectly confident that he would not detect her, she had kept&#xD;
her place. Wher~ he bowed, she hurriedly rose, as if she had&#xD;
been guilty of a great impropriety in thus carelessly enjoy-&#xD;
ing a day that was rare in Thgland: she hesitatingly start-&#xD;
ed toward him; he needed only this invitation to join her,&#xD;
~ o look over her book, and to talk of many things. But&#xD;
he had no idea of conversing much; she directed her steps&#xD;
the house, and guided Mr. Leonard to a sitting-room,&#xD;
where Margaret was painting in water colors, and Mr.&#xD;
Storehouse was reading: she took her seat at a window,&#xD;
and industriously set herself to xvork on her embroidery,&#xD;
quite conscious that ~ pair of dark eyes were altemmate-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly perusing her countenance, and then dropping lower to&#xD;
observe the motion of her pretty fingers.&#xD;
A month from that evening, Sylvia Stonehouse became&#xD;
Mrs. Leonard; another month elapsed ere the married pair&#xD;
had travelled, seen company, and subsided into the quiet of&#xD;
domestic life. It was a sincere delight to both to sit down&#xD;
at ease in their pretty London home the first evening. Syl-&#xD;
via lighted the lamps herself; and drew out a little stand in&#xD;
the middle of the floor, but she also drew forth the news-&#xD;
paper that peered fromh her husband's coat pocket, and p~it-&#xD;
ting it in the stand drawer with a laugh, turned the key&#xD;
upon it. "You must talk !" she said, with her hand on the&#xD;
key, as her inquiring look asked if she had presumed too&#xD;
far.&#xD;
He laughed, and took from another pocket a copy of&#xD;
"Othello," "Read to me, Sylvia !" he said, handing it to&#xD;
her, with the book open at the place where Emilia reveals&#xD;
to the Moor the innocence of his wife.&#xD;
"Do you like that play ?" questioned the silver voice of&#xD;
the bride. "Othello is such a terrible man: I like anything&#xD;
that is soft and tender and flowing"&#xD;
"But we cannot always be soft, and tender, and flowing"&#xD;
j      responded Leonard with a smile, "we are not all such little&#xD;
doves as you are-I like to see passion expressed as Shakes-&#xD;
p~are expresses it. Give inethe book, little darling! I will&#xD;
read to you because I can apprehend Othello: you are the&#xD;
gentle Desdemona 1', Leona d read well, because his whole&#xD;
soul moved to the passions f the play; his rich voice was&#xD;

scarcely richer when it gave to Sylvia's ear his tenderness;&#xD;
his cheek glowed and his smile was half repressed, as he&#xD;
closed the volume with the words, "Isn't that glorious?&#xD;
wasn't that man a master in portraying human passion ?"&#xD;
"I don't like him! I think it Was awful for him to&#xD;
smother Dcsdemona so! I don't see how she could like a&#xD;
black man."&#xD;
"Which don't you like? Othello, or Mr. Shakespeare ?"&#xD;
demanded her husband laughing.&#xD;
"Why, Othello!"&#xD;
"Couldnt you lik9 me, if I were black and ugly ?-~I'm&#xD;
very handsome, bear in 'mind."&#xD;
"You're not black and ugly-I like handsome people the&#xD;
best: I do at first."&#xD;
"But is that just, Sylvk~ ? Suppose I were in all respects&#xD;
the very man that I am, but that the beauty of my counte-&#xD;
nance had disappeared; suppose my skin had drawn into&#xD;
wrinkles atid my two front teeth had been knocked oLt.&#xD;
Don't you think you could have liked rue, after you found&#xD;
out that my external man lied most unaccountably in trying&#xD;
to represent the internal ?"&#xD;
"I never should have found out the internal to such a&#xD;
looking creature."&#xD;
Leonard threw hack his head and laughed heartily. "But,&#xD;
my little beauty, we ought to like people for what they are,&#xD;
and not for what they appear; it is pricing the clothes more&#xD;
than the wearer, to like people only for their looks." lIe&#xD;
had conspicuously committed this error himself.&#xD;

"I wish Margaret was handsome: she has such a beau ti-&#xD;
ful mind and heart, bat nobody tries to discover it: she&#xD;
asked rue once if J would be willing to give her part of my-&#xD;
part of my looks"-Sylvia blushed, and did not dare to say&#xD;
beauty, "for a part of her intellect !"&#xD;
"But what do you want of her intellect when you have a&#xD;
noble one of your own? you are full of poetry and appre-&#xD;
ciati6Vi of everything that is beautiful !"&#xD;
"I'm not as fond of books as I ought to be, but if you&#xD;
like me, I don't care&#xD;
"Not fond of looks, Sylvia ?" questioned Leonard.&#xD;
"What do you mean ?"&#xD;
"Why, I don't like to read: Margaret made me read&#xD;
every day. Shall you think I had better?"&#xD;
Leonard looked at his wife, and a grave shadow~ spread&#xD;
itself over his whole countenance: he fell into dead silence,&#xD;
as the shadow spread itsElf over his whole heart. "Was&#xD;
she teasing him? probably she ~was, for whenever she had&#xD;
spoken of books, she had always shown a highly cultivated&#xD;
taste in selecting passages for him: he did not know that&#xD;
she knew they must be good, because Margaret said so:&#xD;
she had not intended to deceive him: she was not deep&#xD;
enough for that, but she had naturally desired to appear well,&#xD;
and as if she knew more than she did. He arose and walk-&#xD;
ed the floor awhile, then he abruptly said, "Sylvia, repeat&#xD;
the poem you recited last night for me, will you? beginning&#xD;
"The splendor falls on castle walls."&#xD;
She did not answer: his manner had wounded her to the&#xD;

heart: she saw that he was disappointed in her. "What's&#xD;
the rnittcr, Sylvia?" he asked, going behind her chair, and&#xD;
lifting up her face by placing his fingers under her chin:&#xD;
her cheeks were wet with tears. " What's the matter, little&#xD;
darling ?" he repeated in an accent full of tenderness.&#xD;
"You looked so gravely at me !" she sobbed, already&#xD;
consoled by' his voice.&#xD;
He only remembered that he had promised to shield her&#xD;
from sorrow; everything but her timid loveliness was&#xD;
forgotten, as he took a great arm-chair, and held her as if&#xD;
she had been a little child in his arms, whispering words of&#xD;
fondness, and smiling when her April teais were gone, and&#xD;
she sat upon his knee, softly laughing, as she said, "how&#xD;
foolish I was! shall [repeat the poem now, Marcus ?"&#xD;
"Yes, dear !"&#xD;
She repeated it well, and all the fond light was in her&#xD;
husband's eyes, as he pressed her to his heart after she had&#xD;
finished her appointed task: she was happy, and she laid her&#xD;
head on his shoulder as quietly as a kitten, toying with the&#xD;
buttons of his coat, and talking the pretty nonsense which&#xD;
he had deemed so artless and captivating when he had sup-&#xD;
posed it light play of a mind capable of poetic excellence.&#xD;
"0, Marcus! you ought to hear Margaret repeat poetry-&#xD;
she walks the floor and recites whole cantos sometimes:&#xD;
she only taught me a few short pieces. You have'nt&#xD;
noticed my new cuffs !" She straightway displayed the&#xD;
articles upon each wrist. " I embroidered them all myself&#xD;
-don't they look pretty? have'nt you got an industrious&#xD;
&#xD;
wife? wife! it almost frightens me to think what a digni~&#xD;
fled woman I ought to be! do you wan't me to be digni-&#xD;
'V&#xD;
fled?"&#xD;
"Oycs, of course !" he replied, thinking~ meanwhile that&#xD;
Margaret had taught her the pieces which he supposed her&#xD;
own choice had selected.&#xD;
"You did'nt think I was such a little rattle-head of a&#xD;
talker before we were married, did you? I am afraid to talk&#xD;
to gentlemen, that is the reason I am so still in company,&#xD;
but I'm not afraid to talk to you."&#xD;
/ her husband stroked her soft hair as she prattled on, but&#xD;
when he did speak he probed her mental capacities-he de-&#xD;
I:&#xD;
sired with characteristic boldness, to ascertain the extent of&#xD;
his misapprehension: she did not understand the object of&#xD;
his seemingly casual questions, nor did she dream of his&#xD;
sufThring-.when every answer revealed an absolute incapaci-&#xD;
ty to apprehend him from his own stand point: he had&#xD;
looked eagerly to the time when they should be less occu-&#xD;
pied, and should discover rich resources in each other. He&#xD;
did not blame her; God 'had created her tu be a "phantom&#xD;
of delight" to one fitted for her; it was worse than foolish-&#xD;
ness to wish her. differently constituted-but it was very&#xD;
bitter to him that with his desire for inward sympathy he&#xD;
had been misled by the dazzle of appearance,-he who&#xD;
above many, scorned the incessant folly that seemed to link&#xD;
a beautiful interior to a similar exterior, lie was only like&#xD;
the rest of us; he simply committed the innocent error&#xD;
that millions had done before him; that millions are doing&#xD;

every day, and that they wilido for a long time; unwit-&#xD;
ting mistakes are legion, but the Providence of God over-&#xD;
rules them, and makes them work together for good to&#xD;
those who love Him. Alas! in that hour of discovery, th~&#xD;
*     brilliant mind and passionate heart of Diana were glo ~ious&#xD;
to him :-she had seized his thoughts with quickness ~ she&#xD;
understood them, although she sometimes broke away from&#xD;
them, as from a bondage to something that demanded of&#xD;
her more than she was, or was willing to be. lie turned&#xD;
his thoughts from her, conscious that it was wrong to allow&#xD;
them to run in that direction: he talked kindly to Sylvia,&#xD;
fondly even, for he regarded her ~s a gentle child given to&#xD;
his care; the bridal glow of love had not lost its power; it&#xD;
had received its first blow-the fascination, the rich ro-&#xD;
mance, the sweet glory were fi~ding, not into 'nothingness,&#xD;
but into friendship, that sad exchange for idolatrous love.&#xD;
When the hour grew late, Marcus said, "I have a~ little&#xD;
writing to do, dear, wheii you cans pare me !" he kissed her&#xD;
as he spoke.&#xD;
"What makes you write so much V' she pouted, but she&#xD;
left him, and went into the next room: when the silence&#xD;
proclaimed her at rest, he dropt his forehead into his two&#xD;
hands, and mused in a strange and painful bewilderment; so&#xD;
extraordinary were the shocks of 'temptation, disappoint-&#xD;
ment and anguish, that cold drops of sweat started to his&#xD;
brow; as her beauteous presence left him, he saw her as&#xD;
she was truly and spiritually: he reviewed a thousand&#xD;
things which she had said since their marriage which had&#xD;
&#xD;
glanced off from his thought without conveying a true im-&#xD;
pression of her. Now he had the real and not the false key&#xD;
to her character; she was an amiable little woman, with&#xD;
narrow views, utter incapacity for an exalted enthusiasm,&#xD;
and as little able to conceive or execute an original idea as a&#xD;
babe: but her narrow affections were pure and innocent ;-&#xD;
perhaps it was mere lack of mental vision that would have&#xD;
rendered it impossible to her to sacrifice a ne~V dress to, th~&#xD;
good of her country. 'When Margaret or her father suiThr-&#xD;
ed she was the tenderest of nurses, but if all humanity hid&#xD;
hung in peril for need of her life or theirs, she could never&#xD;
have understood that sacrifice was a duty-she could be&#xD;
commanded to do a noble deed, but the principle of obedi-&#xD;
ence would have been at the bottom, rather than that of&#xD;
benevolence. All this perception of her nature came to her&#xD;
husband's mind as he kept his solitary watch; it struck into&#xD;
his heart, as a hammer drives the unwilling nail to its place-~:&#xD;
he had hoped that he dould have cooled the fever of his dis-&#xD;
tress by writing and destroying his thoughts, but he had&#xD;
nothing to say. "To write well, one must feel truly, but&#xD;
not heart-breakingly." It was more easy to commune with&#xD;
th~ "Master of Life~~ who looks on pityingly at our stumb-&#xD;
ling walk toward IJim. He softly closed the door of his&#xD;
wife's bedroom, and then knelt in new and strange humility&#xD;
to ask such guidance as hi~ own proud intellect could not&#xD;
assure to him. Did any one ever dry from ~tbe depths of&#xD;
the spirit unto the Lord in vain ~ The more intense the cry,&#xD;
the more clear the answer. The life which has so suddenly&#xD;

stilled revealed its difficulties, but they were viewed from. a&#xD;
height, and were seen to be necessary to the develope-&#xD;
ment of wider schemes than his own: the childlike bein~&#xD;
who had been laic~ on his heart by the Divine hand-who&#xD;
had been a gift to his blindness rather than his knowledge-&#xD;
this little one needed him to lead her up higher-to walk&#xD;
with one like herself through this perilous world would not&#xD;
have enriched her for the world to come, for with all her&#xD;
sweetness, Sylvia had no reliance upon Omnipotence: the&#xD;
husband saw that he was to bend to her sunny, heart, that lie&#xD;
was called upon to assimilate to her, because to him it was&#xD;
possible; he could keep from her tro~~bled sight the intellect&#xD;
that worried instead of pleasing her, when she was expected&#xD;
to respond to it; if it grew less pliable from lack of contact&#xD;
with an equally developed xvomanlv mind, his heart would&#xD;
grow rich for its unselfish devotion. As he rose to retire,&#xD;
he repeated, "I will be faithful unto death, my gentle Sylvia&#xD;
.-.I will be to you what I ought to be. I sought unlimited&#xD;
happh~ess, but I see now that the All-Wise seeks my good&#xD;
first, L ud bid~ me seek yours-we are joined together fbr a&#xD;
purpose more important than our present happinet~s; this&#xD;
unrest will settle into content 1" Aware that unrest seldom&#xD;
does settle into~ repose without a cause, and, knowing that&#xD;
his thoughts would fly into the realms of discontent, he cast&#xD;
about for a rnea~s of perpetuating his good intentions by&#xD;
strengthening his memory of them. He went to a drawer,&#xD;
where he kept papers and various small articles; from thi~&#xD;
&#xD;
he drew an old-fashioned breast-pin, and fastened it in his&#xD;
plaited bosom. " When I look on 'this unseemly trinket, I&#xD;
shall remember the purpose for which I place it there," lie&#xD;
mused.&#xD;
The next morning Sylvia exclaimed in sbme little disgust,&#xD;
"Goodness gracious, Marcus, are you going to wear that&#xD;
ugly pin ~ I wanted to get you a diamond one, and you&#xD;
wouldn't have it !"&#xD;
"This is my breast-plate, little Sylvia: it stands at the&#xD;
door of my heart to turn away wicked thoughts. Don't&#xD;
you remember the flaming sword which the cherubim&#xD;
wiLided to protect the garden of Eden ?"&#xD;
Oh !" answered Sylvhi, anxious to know whether he was&#xD;
in jest or earnest, and not able to discover from his counte-&#xD;
nance what she desired. "I should think a handsome~ pin&#xD;
could protect you ju~t a~ well."&#xD;
"No! a handsome pin would not disturb my placidity. I&#xD;
shall he rather surprised whenever my eye falls on this."&#xD;
"I don't like it !" said she, busying her fingers with it,&#xD;
and then beginning to take it out.&#xD;
Marcus prisoner her hand, and removed it without smiling&#xD;
so she did not dare to say anything more about it. After a&#xD;
moment he said, "Sylvia, Ii think it would be safer for us to&#xD;
begin life with the habit of family prayer. Where is the&#xD;
Bible ?"&#xD;
She colored, and, looked surprised, but instantly procured&#xD;
it for him. As~ he read, he was conscious that the pro-&#xD;

had not been accustomed to anything of the kind. Jie&#xD;
offered up a fervent petition that the two who had started&#xD;
in life together might find at death occasion for rejoicing&#xD;
that they had been brought to act, each upon the other-~--he&#xD;
prayed that they might learn to forbear, and being merciful&#xD;
to weakness and sin, might learn the blessed art of reveren-&#xD;
cing all that was sincere and pure in the other: he entreated&#xD;
that in every phase of the life that was hurrying toward&#xD;
them, the Angel of the Lord would appear by day and by&#xD;
night, and would teach them to appreciate their many bless-&#xD;
ings, and to draw lasting wisdom from apparent trials-&#xD;
more especially he entreated that his own harsh nature&#xD;
might be saved from bringing sorrow in any shape upon the&#xD;
head of her who had committed herself to his earthly care.&#xD;
Sylvia went impulsively to his side as soon as his service&#xD;
was over; her eyes were full of tears: she laid her head&#xD;
on his breast, and murmured, "I wish I were good like you,&#xD;
Marcus."&#xD;
"You can be good by appealing to One who is' more&#xD;
powerful than your husband, dear," he tenderly responded.&#xD;
"I will help you if I can, but my little wife, you have as&#xD;
yet seen only my best side-sometimes I shall be hasty and&#xD;
impatient, and sometimes momentarily unjust, but let us&#xD;
bear with one another 'and trust in the omnipotence of a&#xD;
puze afThction." He felt that his love for her was purer&#xD;
than before, although it had lost its element of delight: he&#xD;
loved her now, not so much because she could minister to&#xD;
&#xD;
his happiness, as because he could help her to her place&#xD;
among the angels of heaven.&#xD;
"I wish I were talented so that you could be~roud of&#xD;
me, Marcus !"&#xD;
"And I would not alter your mental organization if I&#xD;
could, Sylvia. I would not interfem~ with the handiwork of&#xD;
God: you have a hem~lthy mind, and to alter it would be to&#xD;
disturb the chain of being: your place in the creation could&#xD;
never be filled by any other. All that I ask, and all that&#xD;
your Maker asks is that you obey his will, and cultivate the&#xD;
faculties that you have."&#xD;
"And you wouldn't alter me?" she questioned with ra-&#xD;
diant pleasure.&#xD;
"Only to make you better."&#xD;
"0, thank you! thank you !" she gratefully repeated,&#xD;
pressing her arms around him as she once more laid her&#xD;
beautiful head on his breast: humility was a touching trait&#xD;
in her character. His tenderness was all satisfying to her,&#xD;
~tud she resolved to do her little best to make a good wife,&#xD;
happily ignorant that interchange of ideas niust be a neces~&#xD;
sit~ to her husband's perfect happiness. It was well she did&#xD;
not know that it was more easy for her to be happy in her&#xD;
position, then for him to be in his: he was capable of strpg~&#xD;
gle and conquest-it was meet he should leari~ to be patient&#xD;
und~r the dispensation of life. And so they walked toaeth~r&#xD;
and even thus they won some divihe treasure which coild&#xD;

CHAPTER' XVIII.&#xD;
DIANA BLAKE had long ceased to mention to Miss Leonard&#xD;
her brother's name, but she daily ran her eye over the&#xD;
papers to read the arrivals from abroad. She sat one even-&#xD;
ing alone in the dining-room of her father's house, whither&#xD;
she had gone to glance over the news; her countenance was&#xD;
pale; she sat down as if faint, and pressed one hand against&#xD;
her forehead. She had an instant before passed through sueli&#xD;
an experience as coquettes sometimes encounter. She bad&#xD;
just parted at the front door with a m~n of dark and singu-&#xD;

love that would have slain~ rather than have lost its object,&#xD;

hiss~d, "Diana! may God never blessyou! may you drink&#xD;

come upon her, that it must ,con~e upon her;' already its&#xD;
gloomy folds seemed ready to shroud her: she paced the&#xD;

shaking bands folded the paper and she carried it to her&#xD;
room-there she abandoned her spirit to its agony. TA~&#xD;

messages ineffectual, her mother sought her, and found her&#xD;

"My poor child !" she uttered in alarm. "What ails&#xD;

&#xD;
"A thousand things!" her mother gently laid h~r finger&#xD;
upon her lip: the moment it was removed, she persisted in&#xD;
speaking.&#xD;
"Did I mention th~ name of Marcus Leonard V'&#xD;
"You did sometimes !"&#xD;
"Has Agnes bi~en to see me V'&#xD;
Yes often! but I only allowed her to see you once when&#xD;
y~u were asleep 1"&#xD;
"Amy and Isabel?&#xD;
"Yes; Amy sat beside you a couple of hours once," she&#xD;
was silent a long time afVer this, then with her wea1~ fingers&#xD;
she sti~ove to reach her mother's hand; she could i~ ot, but&#xD;
the thin fingers xVere tenderly pressed. "Thanks, other&#xD;
for you devotion to me-you are pale and tired. T~mrc is&#xD;
no love on earth like my mother's !" she closed her eyes, hut&#xD;
tears forced themselves from under the1 lids and slowly flow-&#xD;
ed over her cheeks: she soon fell into a tranquil sleep. A&#xD;
week later, she was able to sit up in an arm-chair, and even&#xD;
to take a few steps. her mother had resisted her entreaties&#xD;
to see company in her room, but at last gave her consent fr&#xD;
Amy to visit her, when she herself expected to be occupied:&#xD;
it happened' that Amy did not receive her message, as she&#xD;
was at school. The next day, Diana wrote a characteristic&#xD;
note in. pencil to her. It ran as follows:&#xD;
"DEAR AMY :-I cried' yesterday until I 'made myself&#xD;
look beautiful because you did not get my message, for you'&#xD;
to spend the day with me. I am just weak enough to be&#xD;
&#xD;
touched at the pathetic side of events. You'll find me&#xD;
looking intensely interesting from loss of color and sub-&#xD;
stance! Come, Amy! come and do me good Come and&#xD;
help your loving,                        "DIANA.'~&#xD;
This note was received and joyfully obeyed. It cheered&#xD;
Amy's whole heart to hope that Diana had at la~st purposed&#xD;
to become what she had wished to ~become, yet had' not&#xD;
earnestly attempted. The hour was early when her light&#xD;
tap announced her to the invalid-she entered the airy and&#xD;
well furnished chamber with a smile that was quickly re~&#xD;
pleated on the lips of her friend. As soon as she had re-&#xD;
moved her bonnet and shawl and had 'taken a seat at&#xD;
Diana's side, the latter exclaimed, laying her thin hand up-&#xD;
on Amy's: "I am going to tell you of all my follies and&#xD;
errors, and then tell me if it will be of any use for me to try&#xD;
to become good. The past is full of bitter memories, the&#xD;
future God knows. I have told you that I loved Leonard,&#xD;
and yet after he went away, few were the days that I did&#xD;
not listen to words of love from others. He is married !"&#xD;
"Yes, so I heard." responded Amy.&#xD;
"And did you think it would so prostrate the heartless&#xD;
coquette ?"&#xD;
"Why, no ! I did not !"&#xD;
"The heart is a strange thing, Amy. Had I heeded your&#xD;
advice I should have escaped much suffering. I fear I shall&#xD;
ever be in the iron grasp of pride. He will never will find&#xD;

one to love himn more than I have done, but his wife will&#xD;
value him more. I have suffered deeply, and now I shall&#xD;
become a mor&amp;amp; reckless, or a better woman"&#xD;
"Diana, can you affirm the possibility of' growing mcre&#xD;
reckless than you have been? think of the eternity ~that&#xD;
abides your choice 1"&#xD;
"Yes, I think of it! I would give anything for an hour's&#xD;
contentment: I crave continually for something to hilL ~iiy&#xD;
meni6ry! Will the future ever be cheered? Ifeel as though&#xD;
I must, and would be satisfied.&#xD;
"F~l1 sorrows tooth doth never rankle more&#xD;

"But, Diana, it seems so very beautiful to inc to know&#xD;
that sorrow makes it possible for us to begin with more zeal&#xD;
a better course of life."&#xD;
"I feel that a little, Amy !"&#xD;
"Surely you and I would not be so earnestly talking, ~if&#xD;
sorrow had not caused you to lift the mask from your&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"From the first, Amy, I believed that to you I might&#xD;
show myself !-with all my errors~ I am not so heartless as&#xD;
I am esteemed."&#xD;
"I know that, Diana,. by your ardent love for a poor girl&#xD;
like me."&#xD;
"You don't think I am best6wing a favor !" Diana smiled.&#xD;
"No! We give each other treasures of the heart."&#xD;
"New for my confession, Amy !" Without removing her.&#xD;
&#xD;
hand from her companion's, she related circu mstant~l1y a&#xD;
course of coquetry so heartless and wicked, that it pained&#xD;
Amy's ear t6 liten: she did not extenuate- her fault; she&#xD;
did not withhold the rebukes that she had received, nor did&#xD;
she shrink from pointing out one young man who had ruined&#xD;
his fortunes by dissipation, and who in his degradation had&#xD;
~    er, and bade her look on her work-he slept in &amp;amp;&#xD;
drunkard's grave. After rapidly relating many incidents,&#xD;
she closed with the words, "You see how much good I&#xD;
have done! You see that I have listened to curses-you see&#xD;
that I deserve them. But, Amy, I sicken of all this! Oh! if&#xD;
I were strong! Oh! if you were beside me in the hour of&#xD;
peril! Oh! if temptation were not so powerful, but mark&#xD;
me, don't suppose I saw the end of my folly at its begin-&#xD;
ning! I yielded to the pleasure of the hour, and that has&#xD;
dragged in its wake all my misery; 0,' if by one great&#xD;
sacrifice, I could save myself and others from my faults, I&#xD;
would make it, though it were to open a vein in this thiu&#xD;
arm, and let my life-blood out. Amy, do you think I am&#xD;
doomed to become a mere woman of the world? will my&#xD;
heart be drained of all its purity! Shall I become what I&#xD;
hate, when there are in my breast aspirations that are earn~&#xD;

know it! I feel it! 0, help me! No one helps me, no one&#xD;
inspires nw! I am pushed down the current. No one but&#xD;

&#xD;
preaching years stare at me laden with temptations! Can~&#xD;
you give me hope ?"&#xD;
"Ah, yes, Diana! infinite hope: you have only to resolve&#xD;
fur the future, there is no need to take its burdens in ad-&#xD;
vance. 'As thy day is, so shall thy strength be.' You&#xD;
will prove that the Lordyis strong enough to guide you&#xD;
through all things, if you will throw yourself upon his ten-&#xD;
der compassion. Do you attend to the little passing hours&#xD;
and He will weave out of them a wonderful glory. Do&#xD;
you bole for the temptations that will come, and entreat di-&#xD;
vine aid to meet them; they will not grow insurmountable&#xD;
unless they find yon sleeping on your watch."&#xD;
"I should be so happy if I could be rescued from my old&#xD;
self!" said Diana hopefully, "I am sarcastic, prone to&#xD;
ridicule others, I will strive to overcome this fault. 0, if&#xD;
I should gain an entrance at last into the beautiful world&#xD;
that is so dear to you, Amy. This quiet life in my sick&#xD;
chamber is good for me."&#xD;
As she spoke, a servarmt entered the room, and placed in&#xD;
her lap a bouquet and a ote, saying, "The gentleman down&#xD;
stairs asks if you are no yet ~vel1 enough to see him !"&#xD;
"Wait in the hall a w minutes, Mag! Shut the door !"&#xD;
she then turned to Ai y, saying : "I have trifled with&#xD;
hint !" his note was on of tender inquiry--.-.its last lines&#xD;
spoke of his devoted affe. tio~m-his hope that the time would&#xD;
come when no one woul have the right to debar him her&#xD;
presence.&#xD;
"Amy! I'll delude him no longer? I'll cast that tempta-.&#xD;
&#xD;
tion out of my path. Give me paper and pencil from my&#xD;
seci'~tary."&#xD;
Amy handed them to her, with a book for her to write&#xD;
the following upon:&#xD;
"KIND FRIEND :-For many light words, I will speak&#xD;
one true one. Your attachment is utterly wasted on me.&#xD;
It will never be reciprocated by one who is not worthy of it.&#xD;
Forgive!                          "Di~m~ BLAKE."&#xD;
She called th~ servant who waited without, and directed&#xD;
her to give her note to the gentleman below.&#xD;
"When he reads that, Amy, he will think me more heart-.&#xD;
less than he ever dreamed I could be !-and yet at this&#xD;
moment 1 am better than I was when he deemed me good.&#xD;
So people judge our actions, calling the evil good, and the&#xD;
good evil."&#xD;
When Diana variedd of talking, Amy took out her sew-.&#xD;
ing: suddenly the work was touched by the invalid, with&#xD;
the words. "Tell me of yourself; Amy, are yo~i happy ?"&#xD;
"0," returned Amy, lightly. "I don't find the world per-.&#xD;
feetly delectable, still I have a great many bright hopes !"&#xD;
"What are they ?"&#xD;
"Guess !"&#xD;
"I can't, unless they centre in your marriage prospects.&#xD;

"Mr. Second has named the autumn."&#xD;
"Shall you live in the new stone house he has built ?"&#xD;
"No ! I have preVailed on him not to furnish it for us&#xD;
said Amy, reddening.&#xD;
"Why? I should live as handsomely as~j could! what is&#xD;
money gpod for if you don't use it to embellish life?"&#xD;
"I don't want to keep house the first year!'&#xD;
"But why ?" said Diana, pertinaciously. "I've heard&#xD;
you say you didn't like boarding'"&#xD;
"Do you suppose I want to be burdened with the cares of&#xD;
a great establishment ?" demanded Amy. "No, indeed!&#xD;
I like my freedom !"&#xD;

"For one who loves me too well to ".-.---she did not finish&#xD;

." Yes, it is pretty! what an industi~ious little soul you&#xD;
are! what do you make your own dresses for ?"&#xD;
"~It is such a bore to go to a dressmaker !"&#xD;
"I never touch a needle. I hate sewing !"&#xD;
While the two girls thus chatted, they had small appre-&#xD;
hension of the gloom that was to fall over an affectionate&#xD;
home~~ through the little note which the servant handed to&#xD;
the young man who had called to see Miss ~Blake. The&#xD;
shadow of her sin did not fall on ~him alone; it settled&#xD;
&#xD;
grievingly upon the hearts of a mother and sister, to 'whom&#xD;
he was a sunshine; they wept when they sought their pil-&#xD;

smiles that had lieen so easy once! When after long&#xD;
months they came as freely as ever, they did not erase the&#xD;
bitterness that had banished them for a time.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX~&#xD;
A ~w week~ after Amy's visit to Diana's sick chamber&#xD;
Isabel was one day slowly walking home from school with&#xD;
a couple of books in one hand; with the other, which held&#xD;
her drawing book, she occasionally fanned herself~ for the&#xD;
afternoon was warm: the impromptu fan caine to an&#xD;
abrupt cessation of its motion, and her heart gave a, start-&#xD;
led leap, as in a gig that rolled onward, she discovered Dr.&#xD;
Kendrick; he was carelessly eyeiug his horse, and . his lips&#xD;
were in motion, as if he were singIng an air; he very&#xD;
naturally glanced toward the lady on the side-walk as he&#xD;
neam~ed her; his musical capabilities suddenly ceased, and a&#xD;
short, quick pull on the rein brought his horse to a stand.&#xD;
lie had not intended this, but as he bowed, a swift thought&#xD;
passed through his mind; how delightful it would be to&#xD;
have Isabel sit beside him all alone, and if he could not con-&#xD;
ve~y her to sotne enchanted island to live with him forever,&#xD;
he j~7ight at least dream of such a thing as they rode a few&#xD;
miles into the country.&#xD;
"Wait an instant !" he cried, driving to the curb-stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now will you take a ride with me, Miss Isabel ?" he&#xD;
questioned hopefully, yet doubtfully, ere leaving his seat.&#xD;
"Yes !" she smilingly replied, for her while heart assent~&#xD;
ed. "how did you happen along at this very time, when&#xD;
I was thinking how lonely I should be at home without&#xD;
Amy !"&#xD;
"I think my go6d angel was in an indulgent mood, and&#xD;
ordered me down this street, instead of the next one 1" he&#xD;
laughingly responded, as he sprang out, and assisted her in&#xD;
the carriage.&#xD;
"Do you believe in good angels ?" she asked as they&#xD;
started.&#xD;
"' Yes! I've been a very happy man to-day, Miss Bel,&#xD;
and I believe that angels have leaned 'down, and rejoiced&#xD;
with me. Shall I tell you the prosaic origin of my joy ?"&#xD;
"Yes!" she returned, looking toward him with a warm&#xD;
smile that seemed to break from his exultant spirit and. fall&#xD;
over her as the sunset casts lights upon the opposite etirth&#xD;
and heaven.&#xD;
"Don't pronounce 'me unromantic, when I say it is oc-&#xD;
casioned by my having found and cured a very rich and&#xD;
grateful patient."&#xD;
The smile still lingered on her lips; it was full of trust;&#xD;
as she said, "And it will enable you'to do something that&#xD;
you have wantedd to do ?" she thought of his paying his&#xD;
debts, or helping some one.&#xD;
"Yes?" he answered, still looking upon her as if unable.&#xD;
to remove either his smile or gaze; her eyes slowly droop-&#xD;

ed and the roseate color deepened in her cheeks, but her&#xD;
happy smile did not, could not fade; although a revelation&#xD;
of his love and her own, broke into her spirit with delicious&#xD;
power ; she sat as one enchanted, overcome by a sweet sur-&#xD;
prise, yet introduced into a most familiar Paradise.&#xD;
Dr. Kendrick said no more, and with- a consciousness&#xD;
that he could not break the silence without thrilling her&#xD;
more than she desired, she strove to turn with, womanly&#xD;
tact to a new theme.&#xD;
"I thought you didn't keep a gi"&#xD;
"I don't ! I get one from the livery stable when I need it.&#xD;
I have been' to see the patient I spoke of: his good-will per-&#xD;
haps may aid me in reaching forth to the one beautiful hope&#xD;
of my life. Shall I tell you what it is ?"&#xD;
"I am very curious!. Let me hold the whip, won't you!"&#xD;
she was timid .in the presence of her new -emotions; she&#xD;
could nott meet his look, now that his power over her .seem-&#xD;
ed absolute ; with child-like bashfulness she would have put&#xD;
back any~ expression of the love that so deeply startled her.&#xD;
" What is it you want to hold'?" he asked, pretending&#xD;
not to understand, and purposely keeping the article. out of&#xD;
her reach, that she might be obliged to look at him in&#xD;
making a second demand for it.&#xD;
" The whip !". she answered, laughing and blushing, and&#xD;
catching it froni his hand;.with this in her possession, she&#xD;
felt as if it, had been a talisman to restore her to common&#xD;
life. " How do you spppose these handles are braided ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A MY DENB3ROOK-&#xD;
&#xD;
213&#xD;
&#xD;
she queried, passing her gloved fingers over it, and looking&#xD;
itently upon the curiosity.&#xD;
"I have no idea whatever. I think we ought to know:.&#xD;
to-morrow we will drive out to a whip factory and investi-&#xD;
gate the matter, shall we&#xD;
" No, sir ! I haven't time to be idling every day!"&#xD;
lie laughed happily, and then asked in a tone that trem-&#xD;
bled as it fell to a deep cadence, "Would your life be idled&#xD;
away if it were spent with me, Isabel?"'&#xD;
She grew pale, and her lips had no power to form words;&#xD;
she turned her head away from him, as if it could conceal&#xD;
the hastened beating of her heart,&#xD;
'could you live 'with mne for myself alone ? Could you&#xD;
choose me ?" there was an accent of deepest anxiety in his&#xD;
voice, for he did not understand why she turned from him.&#xD;
She hid her hand impulsively upon his, in assurance, and&#xD;
then hastily removed it, murmuring, "I could, if others&#xD;
thought it were best. I am too young to know."&#xD;
lie took the hand that had touched hip, replying: " This&#xD;
is all I ask at present; and this is what I did not mean to&#xD;
ask for a long time yet."&#xD;
As they talked, -they did not observe th t the twilight&#xD;
shadows were falling and that they were proceeding at a re-&#xD;
markably easy pace along the Bloomningdale road. A his-&#xD;
tory of the past fell from the lips of the lovers. Dr. Ken-&#xD;
drick did not conceal the poverty that had beset his way,&#xD;
nor the very moderate success that had at- last crowned his&#xD;
patient efforts. Bel had always had romantic ideas of " love&#xD;

in a cottage ;" she had no true perception of the actual mis-&#xD;
ery which want entails upon rn~rried life~ All she thought&#xD;
ot was herself and Dr. Kendrick illuminating a clean rodm,&#xD;
and rejoicing at a simple repast: she thought it would be&#xD;
beautiful.&#xD;
"And you often felt unhappy because you were so poor?&#xD;
you thought itwould make a difference With me ?" she said,&#xD;
as they turned about, Ifaving reached Harlem Bridge.&#xD;
"I did not think it. would make a difference with you, but&#xD;
I could not consent myself to bring you to trials which you&#xD;
could not realize before t~hey came; and I feared that you&#xD;
might become prejudiced against me ere my fortunes would&#xD;
mend enough for me to seek your favor boldly."&#xD;
"Who did you think would prejudice mc ?" she asked.&#xD;
"I felt that Mr. Second's influence would be against inc&#xD;
-an* perhaps Amy's through his representations."&#xD;
u are mistaken! Mr. Second does not like you, I im-&#xD;
agine;\ but I do not believe he has ever spoken to Amy&#xD;
about us, or she would have told me. She has fhitlj in&#xD;
you ! I believe she would rather trust me to you, than to&#xD;
any Orcosus on earth-but she thinks I ought to be studying&#xD;
my lessons, I expect, instead of talking in this way."&#xD;
"You shall be a child as long as you desire, Isabel.&#xD;
From the first, I feltthat you must be transplanted into the&#xD;
garden of my life-i felt that God had led me to you, and a&#xD;
closer approach arid knowledge of your nature deepened&#xD;
this impression. Yo~ did not know how intently I watched&#xD;
you, when I seemed occupied with other things, nor hoxv&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
many hours I spent in meditating over all you said arid did&#xD;
for you talked with the freedom of a child before me, and&#xD;
unconsciously revealed 'your mind and heart. Every day&#xD;
and every hour your picture rose on my view; it tinged all&#xD;
my life: every evening 1 felt impelled to seek you, and yet&#xD;
ii only caine once in two or three weeks-wasn4t that a stu&#xD;
pendous sort of self-martyrdom ?" he looked by the light&#xD;
of the early risen moon into her down-cast face: she met&#xD;
his smile with a tremulous one, ~but did not speak.&#xD;
'The doctor had, through inobservance, taken a wrong road&#xD;
in the early part of their ride; it was this which made their&#xD;
return home quite late: he looked at his watch, as they&#xD;
reached the house, and found that it was after nine o'clock.&#xD;
"What will Amy think of me ?" said Bel, looking up at&#xD;
their parlor windoww crc she left the carriage; the lace cur-&#xD;
tains were swept back by Amy's hand, and she stood there&#xD;
looking down; Mr. Scored~ stood beside her with his arm&#xD;
around her waist; it was suddenly withdrawn, as the moon-&#xD;
light revealed the erect figure of Dr. Kendrick. A thrill of&#xD;
distress passed through Amy's heart as she caught the&#xD;
angPy light on her lover's ~ountenance, and then, as if irre-&#xD;
sist~bly impelled to follo~ his eyes, she saw~ the doctor&#xD;
~eaoh forth his arms, and tenderly lift Isabel to the ground.&#xD;
In another rhoment, she heard the street door open, and Bel&#xD;
ran up stairs; but she went in the' back room, which was&#xD;
their bedroom.&#xD;
"Dr. Kendrick, wasn't it ?" asked Mr. Second, flashing&#xD;

such a glance of displeasure upon Amy, as she had never&#xD;
expected to see.&#xD;
"It looked like him !" she returned.&#xD;
"Yes !" was his brief comment; his countenance assum-&#xD;
ed for an instant an expression of deterniluation and will&#xD;
that made Amy feel as if she should be perfectly helpless&#xD;
were she his wife, and were he disposed to exert his power.&#xD;
He cleared his brow, and relaxed his firm lips, putting his&#xD;
arm around her once more. "The evening is very clear 1',&#xD;
he remarked in his usual tone.&#xD;
"Yes !" she faltered, feeling still as if a shock had struck her.&#xD;
"You didn't know where JsabJ was, you said ?" he look-&#xD;
ed down at her.&#xD;
"No! I have been with Diana to-day. She is going to&#xD;
Cape May, to-morrow !"&#xD;
"Is Isabel in the habit of riding out at all hours with&#xD;
young gentlemen ?"&#xD;
"No, of course not !" This is her first ride with Dr.&#xD;
Kendrick.&#xD;
"She is young and thoughtless: it is not exactly proper&#xD;
for her to ride alone with geutlemen-.--with mere acquaint-&#xD;
ances&#xD;
"1 think they must have been accidentally detain~.d 1"&#xD;
"Probably! shall I go on. reading to you, Amy ?"&#xD;
"If you please !" tltey sat down by the ~marble table,&#xD;
Mr. Second reading from the book which he had' laid&#xD;
down at the sound .of carriage wheels stopping before the&#xD;
house~ and Amy resuming her sewing; she did not hear, or&#xD;
&#xD;
understand a word he read-his angry look was daguerreo-&#xD;
typing itself constantly upon her heart: he seemed perfect-&#xD;
iy tranquil; his mind was evidently upon the book-she&#xD;
suspected what this ~neant: she suspected from long ohserv-&#xD;
ance of him that all things were to go on peacefully until&#xD;
they were married&#xD;
He laughed out suddenly and heartily.&#xD;
"0, read that over again !" said Amy, "I happened to&#xD;
be thinking of something else."&#xD;
"You did! well, pay better attention, or you shall read&#xD;
yourself; you careless child."&#xD;
She contrived to smile as the amusing passage was re-&#xD;
peated, and then as he went on, she fell into thought about&#xD;
him. Did he so speedily get over his anger, because it was&#xD;
of no comparative importance to him, if Bel and Dr. Ken-&#xD;
drick liked each other? did he get over it, because on reflec-&#xD;
tion he saw that she was not to blame for the ride, and that&#xD;
it was no usual performance Z or did he rely upon his pow-&#xD;
er to stop the intimacy at a future time? He had not been&#xD;
frank with her.&#xD;
He ceased reading. "I should think those little fingers&#xD;
had worked long enough !" he said, putting her sewing ox~&#xD;
the table, and turflil)g her chair around beside his. "What&#xD;

"What put that into your hea%1 ?" he said, good naturedly.&#xD;
"You have some strange ideas in this little cranium !" he&#xD;
rolled a ringlet over his finger, and flattered her with abai~-&#xD;
don. It made her heart impatient, for she knew that she&#xD;
was not charming to him when she lifted the veil! from her&#xD;
best thoughts.&#xD;
"Shall, I tell you what I have been thinking about,&#xD;
Amy?"&#xD;
"Yes I" she spoke slowly and hesitatingly.&#xD;
"1 have been thinking that *we must be married before&#xD;
October! What do you say to such thoughts ?"&#xD;
"I say nay I" she softly answered.&#xD;
"I gave up my cherished idea of living in the house I&#xD;
have built," he said, "and consented to board a year to&#xD;
please you, can't you consent to be married in a month&#xD;
from this time t~ please me. Hey? you don't need to go&#xD;
to school any more? You and Bel and I will travel several&#xD;
months, wouldn't you like that ?"&#xD;
"Oh no! Please not speak about it! I cannot think of&#xD;
it! I cannot think of it! Let the time be later, rather than&#xD;
earlier! I don't want to assume any new dignities." She&#xD;
sat partly turned from him as she spoke; her passionate&#xD;
heart had almost given forth its struggles into words.&#xD;
"You are very perverse, Amy. Turn around, and don't&#xD;
get in a passion." He laid his hand on her arm: he was hurt,&#xD;
bL4t he strove to hide it.&#xD;
She arose and went to the window; the young moon and&#xD;
stars were full of strength.~' 0, God! that I were as&#xD;

'looked up to the tlrma~ment. "Almighty God! wilt Thou&#xD;
leave me in doubt forever? wilt Thou never teach me&#xD;
whether it will be a greater sin to forsake him, or to marry&#xD;
him when I know that we are not one before Thee ?"&#xD;
She went to him, and took the seat which she had left;&#xD;
he looked pale aijd did not notice her: she rested her&#xD;
forehead on his shoulder, and said in a trembling voice,&#xD;
"Justin! I have not learned to love you well enough yet;&#xD;
don't urge me! I don't wantto be perverse. I cannot keep&#xD;
my heart in keeping with my position! I cannot control&#xD;
it! I wish it were dumb, for its beats are alipainful."&#xD;
"Amy, do you love another better ?" he asked huskily.&#xD;
"I love no one now. I am as cold as death; the very&#xD;
capacity for love has died within me." He sat motionless&#xD;
for a long time: he would not give her up, but saw that he&#xD;
must seen~ t~. Do you wish to break our engagement,&#xD;
Amy?"&#xD;
She quickly covered her face with her two hands, and&#xD;
broke into a passion of weeping: he did not seek to console&#xD;
her; after a few moments, he repeated in a deep, sad voice,&#xD;
"Do you wish our engagement broken, Amy ?"&#xD;
"0, forgive the wish !" she sobbed, bowing her face still&#xD;
lower.&#xD;
"You are free; I will, not hesitate to sacrifice my hap1jfl-&#xD;
ness to yours !"&#xD;
Her tears were suddenly stayed, and a dead silence fell&#xD;

over them. At length she said, "You are good." "S~ie&#xD;
did not dare to look at him or she ~would have seen the&#xD;
slight raising of his head at this, and the hopeful light that&#xD;
gleamed across the pale disquietude of his face: both were&#xD;
long silent again; his mind SQOfl seized upon a course of&#xD;
action.&#xD;
He said, "Before ~ve part, Amy, let me say that you and&#xD;
Isabel must remain wards of mine, let me be a friend ~till !"&#xD;
Her thoughts were in a wild chaos; they pressed upon&#xD;
her too confusedly to permit any clearness of purpose or&#xD;
speech, but at his words there surged through them the&#xD;
feeling that she was in his power, and that she could never&#xD;
get away from hhm; this feeling was swept aside by an op-&#xD;
posite one !-he had risen! he stool before her wounded,&#xD;
yet with no hard words fQr her strange unthankfulness.&#xD;
"Farewell, Amy !" he held forth one hand hesitatingly,&#xD;
and then laid it gently upon her head: "I forgive you free-&#xD;
ly, my child: remember me only as one who loved too&#xD;
deeply tor his own peace; henceforth look upon me as your&#xD;
guardian and faithful friend."&#xD;
She looked up with a grateful, agonized, affectionate ex-&#xD;
pression: she lifted her small hand, and pressed his upon&#xD;
her head as if she needed his blessing, then she faltered&#xD;
"Good bye !"&#xD;
The words struck like eQid iron upon his heart; his lips&#xD;
grew a shade paler; he touched them to her brow, and then&#xD;
turned from her. When he reached the door, he gave her&#xD;
one long look of regret. As~soon as she was alone a sense&#xD;

of freedom exhilerated her: it alternated with fiery suffer-&#xD;
ing: she felt that her stay in life was gone; she f5lt that&#xD;
she had given up a devoted love, and she trembled to brave&#xD;
the great, careless world, for the thought of still living up~&#xD;
on his bounty was impossible to her. She sank upon the&#xD;
floor, and buryftig her face in her arms upon a chair, yield-&#xD;
ed to all the pictures that floated before her.&#xD;

With emotions hardly less miserable, Mr. Scored left&#xD;
the house: he was almost stunned by the turn which the&#xD;
evening? befoi'e had taken; lie paced the streets a long time&#xD;
ere his plans rose before him clearly; the little summer&#xD;
moon had disappeared; the July heat had passed away, and&#xD;
freshening breezes blew from the bay, as he unconsciously&#xD;
strode down the great thoroughfare toward the Battery: he&#xD;
entered its cool precincts, and walked backward and for-&#xD;
ward in view of the water; lights gleamed from Castle&#xD;
Garden, and the sound of music was heard; many. poor&#xD;
strollers lingered near the melody, and enjoying it perhaps&#xD;
better than the people within; then the crowd caine out, but&#xD;
'Mr. Second pursued his walk unmindful of all this.&#xD;
"'Twas a mistake to have spoken of a change in the&#xD;
time !" he mused. "I thought I might venture upon it,&#xD;
and now I have got all my winning to do over. Give&#xD;
her up? Never! There was no other way for me to act-&#xD;
No other course would have gone so far toward winning&#xD;
her kind feeling! Her love! Why should it be so hard&#xD;
for ~me to gain it'? I must have it-I will have it !-.-this&#xD;

energy. She loves no one else-the way may be long, bu t&#xD;
it must be run. Give her up'? that is simply impossible!&#xD;
she cannot do without me; if sh~ try, she will find herself&#xD;
surrounded by anxieties, and she will at last be glad to find&#xD;
shelter in my faithful affection-she may bear up with a&#xD;
seeming of courage for awhile, but she will find the world&#xD;
hard and cruel, and poverty will have a thousand stings&#xD;
that it had not before. has she not a latent love for that&#xD;
Coleman? I have seen hauteur in her glorious eyes at his&#xD;
approach. ~-ive her up? No! her very coldness has rivet.&#xD;
ed my Io e, by keeping before me the possibility of losing&#xD;
her. I have long been considered an eligible match by&#xD;
young ladies-their repressed eagerness to get my wealth&#xD;
disgusts A~e. It will not be easy for Amy to resign her&#xD;
flattering ~ osition in prospect, hut 8he can do it, and one~&#xD;
who ~an ~ibandon riches, is capable of such unselfish de-&#xD;
votion as 1 desire, She wondered what kind of a man I&#xD;
was! I have more reason to wonder at her-she is full of&#xD;
caprices, wilful to excess one moment, and then as gentle as&#xD;
she can be. I can't understand her [-when I have con-&#xD;
cluded that she is only a careless, nonsensical child, an4 can&#xD;
be led by a look or word, she startles me by a passionate&#xD;
and determined opposition to me. Women are never gov-&#xD;
ern~~d by reason: you never know where ~ find them-&#xD;
can't live with them; or without them. Sh~'will get over&#xD;
this impulse: she is yielding in the main, and I am strong&#xD;
and patient when it i~ iweessary? she has ~he habit of look-&#xD;
ing up to me; she will find that she loves me. She ~cornes&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
223&#xD;
&#xD;
toward me, and then retreats-there seems to be no con-&#xD;
stancy in her regard, but after we are married it will be&#xD;
different. I wish it were well over. I could find it in my&#xD;
heart to punish her a little for the torment she occasions&#xD;
me: wheti the knot is ti~d, she will discover that however&#xD;
extravagantly 1 may love her, I will be the master, and not&#xD;
the slave. Nothing could give me happiness without her:&#xD;
if she angers me, her look of distress drives the feeling&#xD;
away. I must keep away from her a fe~4 weeks, or I must&#xD;
encounter her accidentally; if she sees me grave and dis-&#xD;
tant, she will be anxious to establish the old cordial friend-&#xD;
ship of long ago: I will not return to it speedily; Lwill be&#xD;
brief in words and visits; she shall not suspect a possi-&#xD;
bility of a renewed offer until I have drawn her safely to-&#xD;

her occasionally with Mrs. Collins-that will make her&#xD;

Amy arose 'from the floor with a sudden thought of Isa-&#xD;

alabaster lamp, and went into her bedroom; to her sur-&#xD;
prise the pale rays fell upon her sister, who was seated on&#xD;
the bed, with her bQnnet still' on, and her hands clasped as&#xD;
if she had' been lost in a world of thought. Slowly unfold-&#xD;

blissful emotion,&#xD;
"0, Bel, tell me of it all !" said Amy, with an instant&#xD;
perception of the beautiful change th at had passed over her'&#xD;
young sister.&#xD;
Isabel laid aside her bonnet ere she tr-usted herself to&#xD;
speak, then she put both arms around Amy's neck, and&#xD;
resting her face on her shoulder, said, "I couldn't be hap-&#xD;
pier than I am !-you said one day that you would live a&#xD;
year of common-life, to taste but five minutes of such joy&#xD;
as angels must feel. I do not envy any angel in heaven,&#xD;
Amy ; I would not part from my life for any other. Can&#xD;
you ever guess the cause of this ?"&#xD;
" Yes, dear Bel ! I know it all-vyou have learned that&#xD;
Dr. Kendrick loves your" there swept a wild. tide through&#xD;
Aiy's breast to feel the difference of their lot-her whole&#xD;
inward life seemed meagre, she saw that; her sister loved as&#xD;
she could have loved, but had not.&#xD;
" Did you suspect it, Amy~ ?" Bel lifted her head with a&#xD;
glad smile, for it was a delight to know that another~ had&#xD;
recognized the love that shad been undreamedof by her.&#xD;
" I saw it; it went to my heart many a time like exqui-&#xD;
site music, awakening only sadness-I knewy that you 1oved&#xD;
him too, Bel !"&#xD;
"' 1 never thought of it-I ever thought that he could be&#xD;
my husban i, or :that any one could love rhe so ! I always&#xD;
felt as if I could go anywhere that he could take me-that&#xD;
he could protect me, if all the world rose against me-I al-&#xD;

he smiled over my heart, and translated its follies into&#xD;
something beautiful. lie said I should be transplanted in-&#xD;
to the garden of his life-I believe I have lived in that gar-&#xD;
den almost from the first, without knowing it !"&#xD;
They sat down on the low French bedstead. " Why did&#xD;
it make you sad, Amy ?" Isabel drew her arm around her,&#xD;
and gently pressed Amy's head to a resting place :on her&#xD;
shoulder ; she passed her hand over her flushed cheeks.&#xD;
"Why, dear ?"&#xD;
"It was so pitiful to contrast the love of Mr. Secord with&#xD;
it; and to be forcing myself to feel what I could not. I&#xD;
saw that Dr. Kendrick loved you for what was deepest, and&#xD;
sweetest, and holiest within you-that he drew nearer to you&#xD;
when- you revealed yourself most truthfully. And I-when&#xD;
my most real self flashed out, it made Mr. Secord ill at&#xD;
ease !" the tears rolled unheeded down her face. "lie&#xD;
wanted me to be perfect, but it annoyed him if I ventured&#xD;
to talk about any spiritual experiences, so I never did but&#xD;
once,-he said he didn't want mp any better ! I .know I suit&#xD;
him when I conceal my real feelings under a lively manner.&#xD;
lie thinks I am beautiful, Bel~ and it is the casket that&#xD;
pleases him. 0, when he has praised me, by the hour for&#xD;
my looks alone, I have -so wished he loved me for my&#xD;
thoughts and feelings instead, f r these will be mine eternal-&#xD;
ly, and I shall throw off the shell that he admires, as food&#xD;
for worms. I have feared that he would cease to take pleas-&#xD;
ure in me, when this bright garment of flesh fades: he some-&#xD;

tines speaks lightly and scornfully of old maids: he never&#xD;
seems to realize thiit they may be more beautiful within&#xD;
than many young girls. If one could be married without&#xD;
caring for a husband's affection or approbation, I could have&#xD;
him. If I could sit in my room, and see him enter, without&#xD;
centering any feelings save indifference upon him, I could&#xD;
get along: if I couid live an independent life, and have my&#xD;
hooks and work arid pleasures to in yself; I could get along&#xD;
-but I could not live with him without identifying myself&#xD;
with him-i could not help clinging to him, and yearning&#xD;
for such love as he could not give. His smiles would b~&#xD;
necessary to me-i should be wretched if he were displeased&#xD;
with me. He might get tired of me when I was fairly&#xD;
caught and caged, and our life might tend to a gradual de-&#xD;
cline of affections, as As the case in the majority of instances."&#xD;
Amy sighed as if it relieved her to unburden her mind.&#xD;
* "What do you niean, Amy'? You speak as if you con-&#xD;
templated parting with Urn !"&#xD;
"I ha~~e! our engagement is broken, hut I feel as if still&#xD;

give u~ a thing which he has once undertaken: he said once&#xD;
in a moment of confidence, that if I had not accepted him,&#xD;
he should have persevered to the end of his life. I fear his&#xD;

so meek and impulsive that patience may triumph over me.&#xD;

of winning daily bread, and the fear of its being taken away.&#xD;
I am more afraid of people than I used to be--I have learn-&#xD;
ed lessons in the selfishness of human beings within the&#xD;
last year or two-what hard gossip have we heard about&#xD;
others and ourselves'? I do not wonder that young girls of-&#xD;
ten marry for money, and for a home. You may think I.&#xD;
am very bad, dear Bel, but it has been a teinpation with me&#xD;
-I have discovered it since I have been hesitating what to&#xD;
do, and I have hesitated for many months-I have ~seen&#xD;
that if Mr. Second had not in his wealth everything to grati-&#xD;
fy my' tastes, it would be far easier to break away from him.&#xD;
I have no rich love to protect me from desiring the lesser&#xD;
pleasures which money can buy-I want to travel all over&#xD;
the world, and gain some beauty and romance to embellish&#xD;
my life. I con Id lay all such delights down smilingly for a&#xD;
love like Dr. Kendrick's---you are rich. Freedom makes me&#xD;
richer than I was, and y~t when I have thought 'of' breaking&#xD;
away from Mr. Second, it has been such an anguish to feel&#xD;
that I 'would make him unhappy-everything seemed strong&#xD;
against me-everything that is gratifying to my easy and&#xD;
pleasure-loving nature is appealed to on one hand-I don't&#xD;
like to depend on myself-I don't like to take the lead in&#xD;
anything-I want to be irresponsible, and be cared for as&#xD;
Mr. Second would care for me. But against all this weak-&#xD;
ness, my conscience is arrayed! my conscience! it stings me&#xD;
- to rise above what is unworthy! it arms the faith that we&#xD;
were taught in childhood with a strange power! we have&#xD;
been taught that for every created soul there is a mate-and&#xD;

Mr. ~ecord is not mine. I feel it with tenfold power when&#xD;
I see you and Dr. Kendrick together! How often has Mrs.&#xD;
Collins stabbed me with the sword of truth, and set my&#xD;
heart bleeding when it would have lulled itself to rest! per-&#xD;
haps she has nerve me to forsake all this !" she looked&#xD;
around the room.&#xD;
"Where shall we go, Amy? what shall we do ?"&#xD;
"We shall go somewhere: we shall do something! od&#xD;
knows what it shall be. L~t us kneel down, and ask irn&#xD;
to take care of us !" They knelt down, and each in si1e~ee&#xD;
poured out prayers-how different! yet how sincere!&#xD;
When they arose they sat do\vn~again on the bed, as if they&#xD;
still could not retire for the excitement of their thoughts.&#xD;
Isabel said, "I am glad you are not going to marry Mr. Se;&#xD;
cord, yet I almost dread, Amy, to have you make a change&#xD;
without consulting any one."&#xD;
"I shall not consult any one regarding our new manner&#xD;
of life, if we escape to a new life: if this effort is to end in&#xD;
submission to my fate, I will sink down conquered, and&#xD;
never try again, to evade the web of influence that has de-&#xD;
tained me at Mr. Scored's side. Haven't you noticed that&#xD;
Agnes and Mrs. Collins have brought their influence to bear&#xD;
on me for a separation from him whenever we have met,&#xD;
and yet so subtly on the latter's part that few save myself&#xD;
would know what her aim was? I think she rather likes&#xD;
Mr. Second, Bel, else why'should she seem to cast over me&#xD;

had just past. "Let us go to bed 1" Ere long they walked&#xD;

angels talk with men while the door of external conscious-&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
&#xD;
A BaEEZY caress from the ocean stirred the leaves and flow&#xD;
eras that had languished under the midday heats at Cape&#xD;
May; the sun had turned from his fiery work, and lingered&#xD;
upon his banners of purple. and gold, shedding upon the&#xD;
earth .his beneficent smile, and touching the rippling and&#xD;
heaving waters with' colors of glory. Diana Blake satin at&#xD;
the window of her room; the blinds were half closed : she&#xD;
was lost to all the sounds of hotel life, and avs~ke only to&#xD;
~out-door views: she was restored to health, and the old life&#xD;
and impulses were stirring within her; she noticed the idlers&#xD;
who strolled out to catch the freshened air that came from&#xD;
the sea-one such was George Coleman ! This was a sur-&#xD;
prise to Diana, for she had seen but little of him for&#xD;
months. -He lifted .his straw hat to let the breeze play&#xD;
through his hair ; the loose rings that curled about his tem-&#xD;
ples, the peculiarly stately carriage of his head, the hand-&#xD;
some throat from which the broad collar was laid back, con-&#xD;
fined by a careless tie of black ribbon--all this was observ-&#xD;
ed by the brown eyes that peered at him through the hotel&#xD;
blinds. "He is very handsome certainly," mused the&#xD;
&#xD;
-t&#xD;
&#xD;
watcher, "he don't look as though he doated on his clothes&#xD;
like the rest of them: yes ! I like him bettei- than any one&#xD;
I have seen yet: I like that careless way of sauntering,&#xD;
along; it looks as though he was not troubling himself&#xD;
about the effect he was producing. I wonder why he has&#xD;
not visited me more lately. He probably took offense the&#xD;
night Marcus and I parted. Hie ought to know that I'm&#xD;
here-it's a great loss to him not to know it. Let me see !&#xD;
there he goes to that clump of trees. H~e11 sit down there.&#xD;
I ought to walk out, and what place so natural as that, with&#xD;
a book and my gypsy fiat concealing everything from my&#xD;
view but the pages before me ! A lions!"- She rose, and&#xD;
looked complacently in the glass at the smoothness of her&#xD;
hair, then she glanced 'down upon her white dress: she&#xD;
opened a drawer, and took froin it a broad pea-green rib-&#xD;
boni, which she -tied around her waist, leaving the long&#xD;
streamers loose ; then she set her gypsy coquettishly on&#xD;
her head, and after tying it under her chin, exclaimed,&#xD;
" That will do, my dear-very rustic 1" She plucked a few&#xD;
green myrtle leaves from a carefully arranged bouquet, and&#xD;
fastened them in her hair, under her bonnet, with a delicate-&#xD;
ly-tinted rose-bud: a few glistening leaves she also placed&#xD;
in her belt. " Heroines are always opportunely startled by&#xD;
admiring gentlemen with an apron full of flowers!" she&#xD;
thought. "1I can't quite equal that ! Heigho ! I never was&#xD;
designed for a saint. But its' such a bore not to be interest-&#xD;
ed in somebody or something. I maya as well strike my&#xD;
colors first as last-its of no use for me to attempt being&#xD;

die! This book will do !" she took a volume of poems&#xD;
from the table, and after glancing fmm the window again,&#xD;
turned the blinds close, and went forth; her steps turned to&#xD;
the grove, and very bewitching she certainly looked, 'vith&#xD;
her hlebe-like figure robed as freshly as nature itself: as&#xD;
she retreated from the vicinity of the hoteb she bent her&#xD;
eyes upon her open book and slowly strolled along until&#xD;
she approached the spot where Mr. Coleman was seated&#xD;
upon a rustic bench. As she was reading in, a half whisper,&#xD;
"My hair is gray, but not with years-&#xD;
Nor grew it white "-&#xD;
a "hem" proceeding from the bench, made her look up&#xD;
with a musical scream. Mr. Col~man was sitting there;&#xD;
~     she closed her book emphatically, and meeting the smile in&#xD;
his eye, she laughed with unaffected heartiness, saying in&#xD;
the next breath, "Do pardon me: poetry will carry me&#xD;
away so, you know !" The sarcastic mirth in her look and&#xD;
voice, met Mr. Coleman's mood : he laughed lightly, and&#xD;
rose, asking her to sit down. She declined, but leaned&#xD;
against~ a tree in front of him. "When did you come'&#xD;
here ?" she demanded.&#xD;
"About two weeks ao'o 1"&#xD;
0~&#xD;
"And where have you been this long time ~&#xD;
"Are you interested to know ?"&#xD;
"Yes, ~f~ourse. Make up a good story, for I wish to&#xD;
be amused I"&#xD;
"I have been away from the city some of the time !"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"And the rest of the time im the city I Did you&#xD;
know I had been sick ?"&#xD;
"Yes! I heard from you frequently. I should have call-&#xD;
ed myself, but supposed it would be a matter of indiffer-&#xD;
ence to you."&#xD;
"Beautiful thought! why should the calls of my ac-&#xD;
quaintance be a matter of indifference at one time\ more&#xD;
than another? Why did you have so little conscience as to&#xD;
ijiflict your fashionable visits upon me some time ago ?"&#xD;
"I wanted to be amused !" he returned with a frank&#xD;
look, and a slight laugh of mischief A little color deepen.&#xD;
ed 'loon her cheek; she smiled a half-smile that revealed&#xD;
and concealed a great deal; it was fascinating to George,&#xD;
and provoked a desire to look into her thoughts, but she&#xD;
bent down, and pulled some of the airy grass blossoms,&#xD;
and then sang a snatch &amp;amp;f&#xD;
"A life in the woods for me."&#xD;
"Well, good bye !" she said, abruptly, "we wont fatigue&#xD;
each other: you've interrupted the flow of my poetic feel-&#xD;
ings, and now I'll go home.~,&#xD;
"1 must go too I there's the great tea-bell ringing-.-we&#xD;
shall hear that. hideous gong presently !" They started&#xD;
away together~&#xD;
"I heard a little gossip about you some months ago, Miss&#xD;
Blake I"&#xD;
her heart gave a distressed leap to her throat, but upon&#xD;
the instant she replied. "A little! you're quite fortunate&#xD;

then, I hear an immense deal :-pray tell me how the fiction&#xD;
ran?"&#xD;
"That Mr. Leonard was to give you his name !"&#xD;
She laughed ironically. "That's a very absurd story Mr.&#xD;
Coleman, as the gentleman is in a state of connubial felicity&#xD;
with an altogether different person !"&#xD;
* "Married, is he ?"&#xD;
"Certainly! haven't you heard of it? the lady is very&#xD;
beautiful."&#xD;
"But-" said Mr. Coleman, remembering the evening&#xD;
when Miss Blake went into the conservatory with Leonard,&#xD;
and did not return to him.&#xD;
"But you are thinking of the last time I saw you !" said&#xD;
she saticily, fluttering her green ribbons upon the breeze.&#xD;
"I was mad, and wouldn't come back to show you how in-&#xD;
efflibly charming I can be, when I try~ You received my&#xD;
*n ote of apology." She spoke so carelessly that the action&#xD;
took a less serious aspect than it had worn previously.&#xD;
"But in earnest, Mr. Coleman," she proceeded, "Mr. Leon~&#xD;
ard and I had a vexation to settle that evening, and we did&#xD;
settle it effectually." Mr. Coleman had replied to Miss&#xD;
Blake's note, but she had never received his missive.&#xD;
From her whole manner, George was led to infer that&#xD;
Mr. Leonard bad never deeply interested her feelings: they&#xD;
talked jestingly until they reached Diana's hotel.&#xD;
"Will you be in the ball-room to night ?" he asked eager-&#xD;
lyas they were about parting.&#xD;
&#xD;
284&#xD;
&#xD;
"I &amp;amp;uppose~ so, if I am in the humour. Mamma won't let&#xD;
me dance long at a. time."&#xD;
"And can you find it possible to obey her, and resign&#xD;
your precious will to any body? asked George, laughing.&#xD;
"I can yield to her more than to 8ny one else," she sin~l-&#xD;
ingly answered; but a shade of genuine feeling followed the&#xD;
gay expression, an cast a softened gr~ity upon her young&#xD;
face.&#xD;
lie bowed and ~eft her, but within his heart he carried&#xD;
the look of feeling, and he spread it as a mantle of loveliness&#xD;
over her whole nature; he regarded it as an under currenV~&#xD;
beneath her wildest mirth. In our judgmeXt of other~ we&#xD;
are usually one-sided ; if we seize upon fair traits, we will&#xD;
not believe in the existence of propensities that will lead to&#xD;
the commission of folly. If we are suddenly disappointed,&#xD;
we feel as if we have been deceived, whereas, we ihave only&#xD;
judged our friend by half his character--we are then~ often&#xD;
reluctant to. give him credit for his actual virtues! Deceiv-&#xD;
ed ! yes! persons of the keenest insight are deceived a&#xD;
thousand 'times! Why complain? we deceive others in the&#xD;
same way. Take a dozen friends, and we know that to each&#xD;
we are different; there be few on earth that know us, and&#xD;
sometimes those who have lived with us many years are ig-&#xD;
norant of us: it is well enough perhaps, if we only shoxv the&#xD;

rare few or a rare one to whom we can show the protean&#xD;

artificial !-the agony and the merriment! the evil and the&#xD;
good ! the heart, and the heartlessness&#xD;
In the evening Mr. Coleman and Miss Blake met in the&#xD;
ball-room; she affected not to see him for some time, during&#xD;
which she industriously danced, laughed, and conversed ; in&#xD;
due season, she promenaded past him, leaning on the arm of&#xD;
a gentleman; by some inconceivable chance, her dainty&#xD;
handkerchief xvent floating to the floor, very near the spot&#xD;
where he stood, he immediately picked it up, and presented&#xD;
it to her, when her gay sallies gave him permission to walk&#xD;
beside her. XVhen she was left alone with him fora mo-&#xD;
ment~ he asked her hand for one cotillion. She nonchalently&#xD;
refused, but he could not take offense; he had never been&#xD;
more tr~dy captivated by her fascinating man nw's; with her&#xD;
tact ~nd intellect, they did for her more than unparalleled&#xD;
beauty would have done. She was in her element, casting&#xD;
her spell over many hearts; she was free from passion her-&#xD;
1 self, and the chalice of adulatioiv was seized in the vain hope&#xD;
that it ~might surpass that of love.&#xD;
"I have a cruel message to bring, Miss Blak~e!" said a&#xD;
gentleman approaching her, "cruel for the poor wights&#xD;
assembled here. Your mother sends a request that you&#xD;
will leave us, on account of your still delicate health."&#xD;
"Mamma thinks, and always will, that I'm not well yet !"&#xD;
responded Diana laughing, "wheieas I know that I am!&#xD;
But au revoir I" she gracefully saluted the little knot of&#xD;
friends around her, and taking the arm of the gei~tleman,&#xD;
left the ball room.&#xD;

When she found herself in her room, she sat down by the&#xD;
mother, who was preparing for sleep in the adjoining chain.&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Di, do come to bed! are you tired? have you enjoyed&#xD;
yourself ?"&#xD;
"Very much !"&#xD;
"I wonder what father would say to your dancing? He&#xD;
said you must live a quiet life here, and not get sick again:&#xD;
he's coming to. stay over Sunday with us&#xD;
"Is he? poor man, he works hard enough to have a l~tt.le&#xD;
rest."&#xD;
Mi's. Blake 'sank among. her pillows, and soon fell asleep.&#xD;
As Diana sat in the dreamy silence, hearing the distant&#xD;
waves as they broke in murmurs upon the shore, the&#xD;
brilliance faded from her spirit, and the fiend came to gnaw&#xD;
her heart: she called it "the fiend,'~ but it was "the still,&#xD;
small voice" of the Lord, ~triving to arouse the better&#xD;
life in which she had for a brief time found some peace:&#xD;
the anguish preyed upon her so resolutely, that she started&#xD;
up, and lighting a fresh lamp, drew out her writing ma&#xD;
trials, to converse with Amy De~brook; she Mt as if&#xD;
guilty not to show how she had gone back from her ardent&#xD;
resolves. She commenced-&#xD;
"I'm in a wayward humor to-night, dear friend. There&#xD;
come old thoughts across my brain. My bark is out, who&#xD;
has the helm? where is it driving ~ Amy, mine own&#xD;

dear friend~ had 'you been at my side from childhood, I&#xD;
would not now have to say that I am sinking-you opened&#xD;
my thoughts in a new direction, and once, oh! that the&#xD;
time is past, I thought I reached up my hands to God-but&#xD;
life and the world ~re too much for me. I have followed an&#xD;
igni~ fatuus, and each one palls the very soul-I have rush-&#xD;
ed with impetuosity over the head sea of life within ea~th-&#xD;
ly aim or future hope. Do you remember that you once&#xD;
told me, it was a fearful thing to forget to worship in the&#xD;
holy of holies? I am forgetting-I have forgotten! I cannot!&#xD;
Temptati&amp;amp;ns beset me, and I yield. I have already lured&#xD;
new hearts into my net since I have been here. Do I care&#xD;
fur them? no! one interests inc a little-he can help inc to&#xD;
kill time. There is such mockery and hollowness in the&#xD;
world-there is here-how young I am to find this out! I&#xD;
cannot but sport with the feelings of others. A man might&#xD;
sooner wed the ocean, than~Diana Blake. There is a levity&#xD;
about me that I cannot resist-a new face has for a time&#xD;
a cijarm that is all absorbing. Gossips of first' notoriety&#xD;
say that I am to be married soon, but you and I know that&#xD;
the victim will not be executed at the appointed season. I&#xD;
- have no prospect of ever being called by. theendearing name&#xD;
of mother: none of d5ling little expressive faces, and comb-&#xD;
ing raven locks, and stifling 'little wailings with bread and&#xD;
sugar. Amy! Your candid words are to me the rarest&#xD;
gems of earthly love I' hear so much flattery, that truth&#xD;
comes like water from the wells of salvation! but, plead&#xD;

Do I weary you, friend? I will to another theme. I hear&#xD;
something of spiritualism here: it has roused a tornado of&#xD;
curiosity in my heart: what do you think of it? I wish to-&#xD;
night I could be psychologised into rest! rest that is satisfying.&#xD;
At times I am wildly happy-no, excited, I flirt, .and the&#xD;
~ moment, I feel almost a repugnance to the deluded&#xD;
men who seek me. see visions of the "might be," but&#xD;
I ~hal1 never realize them. 0, I wonder if on God's greeli&#xD;
earth there exists a being so contradictory as myself-the&#xD;
fine gold and the clay ~re forever at war, and people appeal&#xD;
to the clay-at least such people as I am cast with. I will&#xD;
not tease you longer with my foolish thoughts. Ho~V goes&#xD;
life with you? shall you soon be anchored h~i the quiet&#xD;
haven of d domestic peace? You will win the 'vi~to ry what-&#xD;
ever your lot. Wherever you may be, you will find&#xD;
Diana's heart turning to you with it~ depest honesty of love&#xD;
-and oh, be faithful to me!&#xD;

P. S. You have a monstrous fault, Ari~y, and christian&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
WEEKs had passed away since the evening that Mr. Scored&#xD;
had parted with Amy Denbrook. lie had been to the home&#xD;
that he had provided for her, and to his anxious inquiries&#xD;
for ~the young girls, Mrs. Brooks could only inform hiiit that&#xD;
they had left the premises, while she was in the country:&#xD;
upon her return she had found a letter of farewell, and a&#xD;
request that the key of their rooms should be given to Mr.&#xD;
Second, with a tiny sealed packet. This she gave i~im, and&#xD;
with a strange mixture of agitation and anger he hastened&#xD;
to the deserted apartments. Their, quiet and darkened&#xD;
aspect fell over him like the~shadow of death; "Never-&#xD;
m~re" was chanted through his spirit; he felt that he was&#xD;
growing to be an old ~man; he had passed his meridian-...-he&#xD;
had~ realized one dream of his boyhood-he had become&#xD;
rich with an unspotted name. But the other' dream! it had&#xD;
died perpetually as it arose. The beautiful home, 'vith the&#xD;
fair wife and innocent children, where were they? it was for&#xD;
them that the riches were gained through ceaseless toil of&#xD;
mind and body. Mr. Second never gave himself up will-&#xD;
&#xD;
in gly to unhappy reflections; he was a man of action rather&#xD;
than studious thought: he never stopped to say to his ~oul-.&#xD;
"Work into thy thought intelligence of the kind ~f' pain,&#xD;
b&#xD;
that thou mayest never inflict it on another~spirit. Then its&#xD;
work is done; it will never search thy whole nature again."&#xD;
ITo gave way to the desolation that came over him but a&#xD;
short time, then he arose to see if there were a letter from&#xD;
Amy: he opened the window shutters, and untying his&#xD;
packet found two small keys; one belonged to the book.&#xD;
case, and the other to the bureau; he hastily opened the&#xD;
drawer of the former which had been Amy's: it c6utained&#xD;
bitt a single article, and that was an epistle directed to him&#xD;
self. He pressed his lips together firmly as he saw it, and&#xD;
sat down where the red sunset fell upon the paper as he&#xD;
tore it open. Each word went to his heart with torture.&#xD;
It was thus written&#xD;
"DEAR FRIEND :-I sit ~lown to the hardest task of my&#xD;
life. How c~n you forgive so much? I am going to leave&#xD;
your forever !-~as benefactqr, guardian, friend, lover. It is&#xD;
two days since you laid your 1han~ upon my bead, and told&#xD;
me I might be free. I hold the Bible to my heart as if it&#xD;
could strengthen me to say such cruel words as must ex~&#xD;
plain my act I The experience of a long year has convinc.&#xD;
ed me that I cannot walk through life beside you, and re~&#xD;
tam such fervid spiritual aspiration, as I must have,, to&#xD;
gain the kingdom of God. We are exactly opposite each&#xD;

other in opinloix To m~ religion is the Alpha and Omega&#xD;
of existence. I have not bored you with it, for I have seen&#xD;
that you had only a light laugh for my deepest religious&#xD;
feelings-I have seen them die under your influence-I have&#xD;
long been tempted to pluck th~ f4al apple, and turn from&#xD;
God. But at this crisis of my fate, I dare n~t hesitate:&#xD;
either I must always conceal my soul from you, or show&#xD;
you 'thoughts and feelings that will forever utter a protest&#xD;
against your own. Views that you approve, I hate. You&#xD;
say, "Every man for himself!" I pray, "God deliver me&#xD;
from this propensity within me." You say, "This world is&#xD;
go6d enough 'for me !~' I pray, "Amid its l~l~ssings, oh&#xD;
God, keep eternally before me the light that breaks over~&#xD;
the Dele~table Mountains." I do nbt say this in the belief&#xD;
that it will draw your heart toward me; it will rob me of&#xD;
the light in which you have looked at me. It w ~show you&#xD;
that I am not a little wilful girl, as you esteeii~~ e, but a&#xD;
woman who would have no fascination for yo1~~atever,&#xD;
if wholly understood. I desire that you should see that&#xD;
your own happiness could not be promoted by taking me&#xD;
into near companionship. The froth of life' is well enough&#xD;
in its place; it is not happiness, to ignore the true hunger&#xD;
of the soul. I could not have over you the kind of&#xD;
influence that would give content with my lot. Your habits&#xD;
of life, and your Opinions are formed, and alas! they have&#xD;
always 'turned me away from the green pastures and still&#xD;
waters. of divine' promise, to bend me to the world. You&#xD;
&#xD;
have not intentionally won me from the Lord, but the tenor&#xD;
of every life is for, or against Him.&#xD;
"Justin! ever kind friend, I would not have said what I&#xD;
have done, if I did not believe it would make it easier for&#xD;
you to dismiss me from your heart. It ~vould be dearer to&#xD;
my vanity and my true friendship for you to be remember-&#xD;
ed as the affectionate and grateful Amy, rather than as the&#xD;
cold observer who noted even in mOIflel)tS of abandon,&#xD;
the cast of every thought and expression. I can make no&#xD;
return for your candor that I may break the illusion of&#xD;
your love. 0, if I could make you happy in iome way !-&#xD;
but I cannot! 'If you grieve to read this, know that I suffer:&#xD;
But I hear the words sounding as if from heaven. "This is&#xD;
the way, walk ye in it," and we mu~t part. You' have a&#xD;
strong will, so have I !-what I should desire, you would&#xD;
oppose-for example-My sister should never break her&#xD;
heart to live magnificently with a man not of her own elec-&#xD;
tion. Even if you said not a word on the n atter, I should&#xD;
be aware that you could not think with me. To me, un-&#xD;
spoken opposition in a husband would be oppressive-I&#xD;
would not ask silence, but accord. There are many' points&#xD;
where we should diverge-some, where I should deem it&#xD;
right to act in exact opposition to your wishes, and were I&#xD;
married to you, I would do it, if the consequences were nev-&#xD;
er so disastrous to our apparent happiness--I would sacrifice&#xD;
the peace of the hour, to a satisfied conscience. It is a delicate&#xD;
thing to touch upon the gratitude I Qwe you; it can never&#xD;

much for years-perchance with some rare outbreaks of ~&#xD;
* tensest passion! but when the. cup suddenly overflowed-&#xD;
only a little! I would spring into liberty, and shut back&#xD;

couj'se, by such necessities of instinct, as she could not re-&#xD;

The other jewels you will find in the upper drawer of the&#xD;
bureau. I wept over them as I laid them away-it seemed&#xD;
like laying down some brightness. Isabel is sittii~g on the&#xD;
floor by her trunk crying as if her heart will break, and&#xD;
raising her head every other instant to exclaim, '0,&#xD;
entreat him to forgive us, and tell him how we love him&#xD;

again be as happy as I have been; perhaps I shall die a&#xD;
poor old maid, but I shall carry within my heart your&#xD;
remembrance with anguish, friendship, and gratitude.&#xD;
Good-bye, Justin, dear Justin!&#xD;
"Your miserable,&#xD;
"AMY."&#xD;
Mr. Scored finished the letter with contradictory feel-&#xD;
ings; a fieicc anger burned against Amy: he hated the&#xD;
rcsolute spirit that had taken possession of her yielding&#xD;
form--he hated her calm arguments--her scrutiny of him-&#xD;
self--her cool defiance of his will and sentiments-her pas-&#xD;
siona~e style of feeling small things, as they seemed to him.&#xD;
But the spell of beauty was still around her, with youth&#xD;
and laughing looks, and voice of music, and tears of feeling&#xD;
pettish words followed by repentant accents-gentle&#xD;
smiles when he was grave-saucy and defiant flights whea&#xD;
he presumed upon them. He loved her' as she seemed under&#xD;
the guiseof her every day manner, bitt not as she was.&#xD;
With a heavy sigh he went into the back room, and un-&#xD;
locked the dressing bureau: there lay the bracelets, the&#xD;
ring, the watch and chain, with many other costly gifts: he&#xD;
did reverence to Amy's worldly sacrifice-he realized her&#xD;
honesty of~ purpose, and his tears dropped upon the resign-&#xD;
ed gifts: he dashed them away with sorrowful impatience,&#xD;

but his loss sighed through his soul with the same desola-&#xD;
tion as when he entered the lonely rooms: he bowed above&#xD;
the open di'aw, as one might bend over a grave, he wept for&#xD;
her and himself. She said his influence bad turned her&#xD;
fi~ora things religious, to things temporal--it xvas the tenor&#xD;

was uns(iuIldness in his morality if it had thus affected her&#xD;

them ,from his jesting ridicule, In hi~ misery he even sent&#xD;
up a prayer to God to make him a better man.; an angel&#xD;

broke out, "But the business? what is it fdr? why should&#xD;
I go on amassing mo4 money? must I work only to keep&#xD;
off misery? must I never work to win happiness? Perhaps&#xD;

she might have loved me better if I had made allowances&#xD;
for her different education, for her plebeian tendencies: I&#xD;

she shrank from a wife's~ cares in her day of early youth:.&#xD;
we men never think of this, when we press our suit with a&#xD;
'Now or never!' I thought I conferred everything, and&#xD;
she had but to accept, while she yielded up nothing save her&#xD;
lowly fortunes for my wealth-she saw all this, and she has&#xD;
left me! 'There are as good fish in the sea as ever were&#xD;
caught.' That's a lie! a thing is valuable not so much for&#xD;
itself as for the happiness it can bring us! But, tush!&#xD;

pulse bade her fly and bury herself in some secluded place,&#xD;
that she might never again behold Mr. Ashley, who had&#xD;
gained over her 'a powerful and extraordinary influence;*&#xD;
'. but this impulse died away2 when she saw him, or listened&#xD;
to the artful sophistries of the woman who was ever at' her&#xD;
side. She deceived herself into the l elief that' her intellect&#xD;
and conscience were the umpires which she appealed to, when&#xD;
the poison of unlawful love had permeated her whole being,&#xD;
aiid her prejudiced heart decided every question.&#xD;
As his wife declined to accompany him, Mr. Ashley fell&#xD;
into the habit of calling alone at I~Ir. Harrington's-it&#xD;
vaguely passed through the minds of Agnes' uncle and aunt&#xD;
that this was a little singular, but their unlimited confidence&#xD;
in her, set them at ease, and they regarded the visits as&#xD;
friendly and social, and designed for the whole family.&#xD;
They did not observe, as Mrs. Collins did, that a 'world of&#xD;
passionate emotion was kept in cheek, as Agnes uttered a&#xD;
quiet, "Good evening, Mr.Ashley,~~ when she passed. into&#xD;
the parlor, and sat down in shaded corner. To Mrs. Col-&#xD;
lins, Agne~ poured 'out eve~y thought and struggle of her&#xD;
soul; this ~vas usually listed ed to in silence; sometimes a&#xD;
few words were spoken, which were calculated to lead the&#xD;
bewildered girl a little nearer to the brink of ruin. The&#xD;
two occupied the same chamber, which gave INA~5. Collins&#xD;
an opportunity to watch every mood that came to her corn&#xD;
panion. One evening after Mr. Ashley had left, and they&#xD;
were sitting alone in their apartment, Mrs. Collins exclaim.&#xD;
ed, abruptly: "Agnes, what are you going to do ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"hush! don't startle me with the thought that thereris&#xD;
aught to do, but to see him once in one or two weeks !" re-&#xD;
plied Agnes, trembling. "I ask no more-thereiflust be no&#xD;
change, or I must fly ! Don't tell me that I must separate&#xD;
him from his wife! my love is of the spirit. I am satisfied&#xD;
to love him, and to kno~v that he loves me. 0, if' an angel&#xD;
would point the way, I would follow though I were taken&#xD;
away from him during all my life 1?' she fell on her knees&#xD;
before the fcmptress, and her tears dropt as she implored&#xD;
"teach me what is right teach me the truth,, and I will lay&#xD;
my heart on burning coals to obey. You are wise !-you&#xD;
are older then I am. You say you love me, and desire the&#xD;
development of my highest instincts. I am fainting and&#xD;
fevered under this passion that has stolen upon me 'as a&#xD;
thief in the night.' 0, if 1 should be wrong !a0~ if it wei'e&#xD;
sin ~to love one who is bound by legal ties to another! I&#xD;
have struggled so long between conflicting views! I have&#xD;
looked upon t ~e world, and have grown sick at the picture&#xD;
of' its misery, but is present happiness the first thing that we&#xD;
must seek? 0, Mrs. Collins, if I should act with the fright-&#xD;
ful decision that you seem to counsel, what would my&#xD;
brother say? what would my uncle and aunt feel? Mrs.&#xD;
Ashley is already jealc~us-she would be ready to tear me&#xD;
in pieces. I think as you do sometimes, but I have doubts&#xD;
-terrible doubts! 0, my God, that I should have been&#xD;
hurled into this wild sea of conflict I"&#xD;

strong enough to bear it. I can tell you why you are ir~&#xD;

"Speak on! I ask foi~ truth though it slay me !" The&#xD;
whole countenance of Agnes glittered with feeling.&#xD;
"Then, my friend, you must permit me to tell you that&#xD;
fear is the controlling power that enslaves you; if you&#xD;
could be emancipated from this, you would take a wise,&#xD;
calm view of your duty. You have a grand mission before&#xD;
you, if you have courage to embrace it. You have intellect&#xD;
and purity, and you should be a guide to weaker sisters-~&#xD;
you should help them to break their chains. Do you sum&#xD;
pose that you are not responsible for the use which you&#xD;
make of your talents? Do you suppose you can innocent-&#xD;
ly settle down in the accustomed routine, when you are call-&#xD;
ed to give light to others? What is preaching worth, if all&#xD;
men and women are cowards, who shrink from practice?&#xD;
There are ftindamental principles that you assent to. Do&#xD;
you not believe that the regeneration of the world will take&#xD;
place When those who are in affinity come together ?"&#xD;
Agnes was silent, and Mrs. Collins continued, "our&#xD;
prisons are filled with those who have been constrained to live&#xD;
with uncongenial companions : we must come into bar&#xD;
monious relations with the persons who are fitted to make&#xD;
us happy. We must have courage to snap false ties. Do&#xD;
you not see that the millennium will commence when love&#xD;
dwells in eyery circle? you and Mr. Ashley experience a&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
love that will crown you both With peace and sunshine, but&#xD;
you are trampling upon it: you will not ultimate it before&#xD;
the world. You are a hypocrite. You per ut him to be&#xD;
bound with false legal chains-they are as false to Mrs.&#xD;
Ashley as to him-they cover a yawning pit of discord. She&#xD;
is riot able to release herself from the current superstition;&#xD;

being: a legal restraint, a gossiping world forbid you the&#xD;

purity, and live out your convictions in the face of a scornful&#xD;
multitude 1"&#xD;
Agi~es shuddered as if an icy wind had penetrated her;&#xD;
the fevered carnation of her lips faded, the glittering bril-&#xD;
liancy of her eyes faded into a haggard steadiness: she look-&#xD;
ed as if turned to stone, but she uttered no words, ~nd still&#xD;
knelt in her place.&#xD;
"I have not said much of what you owe to one whose life&#xD;
is bound ~ip in yours," proceeded Mrs. Collins, after obser-&#xD;
ving her with the keen coldness of a naturalist. "You, out&#xD;
of all this vast creation; have power to develop that which&#xD;
is. deepest and truest in Mr. Ashley's character: you should&#xD;
strengthen him until he can emancipate himself from the&#xD;
thra]doxn of years: you can make him happy and good, and&#xD;
your life belongs to him;, his life belongs to you. You are&#xD;
in spirit truly married to each other, and it is wicked to be&#xD;
ashamed of so true a union. Do you wish your good to be&#xD;

Agnes spoke in a low voice. "Mrs. Collins, the degraded&#xD;

flush! or I shall leap the precipice! I shall spring to&#xD;
heavefl or hell! It is heaven, I, believe !" Agnes spoke&#xD;
like a fanatic, and rose from the floor with her hands&#xD;
clasped, her countenance kindled, and her whole frame&#xD;
trembling as her soul swayed in the balances. There was&#xD;
about her no trace of the calm, collected being of other&#xD;
days. She quitted the apartment, and entered another&#xD;
chamber, unmindful of the darkness-she panted for soli-&#xD;
tude. She opened a window, and looked out upon the&#xD;
clouded firmament; there w ~s dense blackness alone, no&#xD;
star stole out from the' hidd ~n sapphire: one or two mid.&#xD;
night lamps gleamed in the distance, trembling through the&#xD;
mist. She sat down, and laid her cheek upon the window-&#xD;
sill, reckless of the damp night winds; she sat there the&#xD;
livelong night, save when with unslippered' feet she paced&#xD;
2 the floor. Thiswas one night out of many: she was not&#xD;
yet prepared to sacrifice her fl~ir fame. Months passed&#xD;
away, during which time, Mr. Ilarrington's family ~vere~ in&#xD;

her to cast her lot with his. Every day, every hour she.&#xD;
grew stronger in the views that would justify her in yield.&#xD;
ing to her heart; she came to embrace them at last with an&#xD;

aunt, neither in any one ~vho would have opposed her&#xD;
course strongly. She was secrefive, during the long&#xD;
months of indecision and wavering; she blushed to be&#xD;
frank, until she was wholly eluded; her head was steeped&#xD;
in fallacies that rose from her heart. Mrs. Collins smiled&#xD;
to herself to see her zeal and sincerity--she had aroused the&#xD;
martyr-spirit: she had in the hour of temptation given her&#xD;
the false ~Christ, and she had no pity. as she saw her pros-&#xD;
trate in adoration. She was no wonder to this powerful&#xD;
woman, who intrigued, and enslaved human souls from an&#xD;
inherent love of dominion, and from a restless mental activi-&#xD;
ty that found it necessary to expend itself: principles and&#xD;
systei~s were valued only as means of power; she was&#xD;
too cold and strong to feel the glow of generous enthusiasm&#xD;
-she could as easily go from one theory to another, as&#xD;
change her dress, carrying with her a faculty of convincing&#xD;
others, where she herself was not convinced.&#xD;

CHAPThR XXIII.&#xD;
WHILE many others had been inhaling country ,,breezes,&#xD;
Amy and Isabel had been the occupants of a small chamber&#xD;
in the upper part of the city: from school girls they ha4&#xD;
become seamstresses-~-the panorama of their past life had&#xD;
rolled away completely. They saw no one but Dr. Ken-&#xD;
drick. Agnes and Diana did not even know where they&#xD;
lived, for their letters were directed to "New-York City,"&#xD;
at Amy's request. Isabel was happy, because her affection-&#xD;
ate heart was satisfied , and she had neither fear nor care for&#xD;
the future. She was often weary and annoyed, but except&#xD;
at infrequent intervals, she was more proud and joyous in&#xD;
her very soul than she had ever been. Not so Amy! some&#xD;
brave elixir, ~oine spiritual strength had lifted her above&#xD;
herself for a time, but sh~ relapsed, and often found herself&#xD;
uttering, the inward exclamation: "I must be equal to the&#xD;
life I have chosen."&#xD;
She sighed for intercourse with the gifted and refined:&#xD;
she had by her own act deprived herself of.this privilege.&#xD;
She found herself everywhere treated with less attention&#xD;
than when she dressed handsomely; both men and women&#xD;

seemed to find her of less worth than formerly. At the&#xD;
store where she obtained her embroidery, and where she&#xD;
had often been a purchaser, she saw a nice but mean dis-&#xD;
tinction made between the f~ishionable young lady, and the&#xD;
dependent girl it seemed difficult to her to confine her&#xD;
fingers to the shaping of vines and flowers, while her miiid&#xD;
was receiving no rich material for future use. She could&#xD;
not obtain books that would encourage and inspire her, or&#xD;
if she did, she had~ little time to read them. Sometimes&#xD;
when pressed with, thought she would say? Is there not a&#xD;
corn mon-sense view to take of every subjec~? I think I&#xD;
acted according to the highest intuitions of rn~ mind-they&#xD;
have led me to a path that is tedious. But the step is&#xD;
taken. I follow my convictions of right."&#xD;
"0, how ~hot it is! not warm, but hot !" cried Bel, one&#xD;
day breaking in upon these cogitations; she drew a long&#xD;
breath, pushed back her hair, and fanned herself a moment&#xD;
with her work . "I don't think I was cut out for adver~&#xD;
sity! I declare! one would think it was the last of July&#xD;
rather than~ September. Do you ~think, Amy, that we fully&#xD;
realized how we should sit here in this den, and work&#xD;
and ________"&#xD;
9&#xD;
"I don't know anything about it !" returned Amy with a&#xD;
sharpness that showed l~er unrest.&#xD;
Isabel Was silent, for she was accustomed to seeing Amy&#xD;
angelic and 'cross in the same day: nature and grace were&#xD;
at warfare in her breast. After the fapse of half an hour,&#xD;
she said: "It seems, B~l, as if everything that is irritable&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
and wicked in my nature has been stirred up lately. I&#xD;
thought I had almost conquered myself and was quite good,&#xD;
hut I believe God is determined to show me to myself re-&#xD;
lentlessly, that I may know a life-time is needed to bring me&#xD;
into spiritual symmetry. I expected a kind of' divine rest&#xD;
after I had crossed the Rubicon. Sing to me and charm&#xD;
away the evil spirit that tyrannizes over me&#xD;
Isabel obeyed, and sang a chant in a low, touching voice;&#xD;
she sang from the Scriptures: "Surely lie hath borne&#xD;
our griefs and carded our sorrows." Perhaps in the whole&#xD;
domain of the Inspired Word, there was hardly another&#xD;
chapter so full of moving consolation for Amy: her tears&#xD;
fell in a soft shower, and when her sister had finished, she&#xD;
smiled with trembling lips, as she said "You have done roe&#xD;
so much good Bel. I know now, that I am where I ought&#xD;
to be. It is my spiritual rather than intellectual nature that&#xD;
needs cultivation; and these experiences are best for me, or&#xD;
God would take me away frolA them."&#xD;
Isabel listened with interest, but at the sound of carriage&#xD;
wheels, she gave a delighted bound . from her seat, with the&#xD;
exclamation: "There's the doctor's gig: you roust ride to-.&#xD;
day, Amy !"&#xD;
No! I don't want to! I won't !"&#xD;
"But he said he was coming for you to-day '!"&#xD;
"Tell him I am going out !" she laughingly pushed Isabel&#xD;
out of the door, and as she closed it, remarked to herself;&#xD;
"The idea of my going with him, when he would be wish~&#xD;
ing every minute that I were Bel! Not 1!"&#xD;

&#xD;
The doctor secured his horse, and then ran up stairs with&#xD;
Isabel, and with such cordial and merry kindliness insisted&#xD;
on having Amy for a companion, that she promised t~ go&#xD;
next time; she saw that he had from his heart adopted her&#xD;
as a sister, and she believed that it would be an actual pleas-&#xD;
ure tq him to converse with her about one so dear to both.&#xD;
label equipped herself; and proceeded down stairs with her&#xD;
lover, looking extremely happy considering~ her anxiety that&#xD;
Amy should go in her place.&#xD;
The sun was yet two hours high: Amy speedily dressed&#xD;
herself with the intention of calling at Mrs. Tlarrington's, in&#xD;
order to ascertain whethev~Miss Leonard had returned from&#xD;
the country: the letters of Agnes had grown shorter and&#xD;
shorter, and the spirit they breathed was unlike that of&#xD;
old: formerly she had talked of conquering, self; now she&#xD;
spoke of selfassertion: she wrote with contempt of the&#xD;
tyranny of custom: she referred to the weakness and nar-&#xD;
rowness of individuals occasionally, regretting the common&#xD;
inability of mankind to live true lives. She made no dis-&#xD;
closures of her private experiehees, and Amy, conscious&#xD;
that some powerful change had passed over her, was soli-&#xD;
citous to learn the whole truth; that Agnes had less tender'&#xD;
charity than she had formerly she could not but perceive:&#xD;
that she loved her less ardently, she sighed to realize; but&#xD;
she could not lose her, wjth all the other embellishments&#xD;
that had passed away, and so she sought her in a mood that&#xD;
was both sanguine an~ doubtful. She did not so misjudge&#xD;
her, as to opposee tl~at her present extreme poverty would&#xD;

rington's and stood once more upon the great stone porch,&#xD;
recalling the first t~me that she had passed the house with&#xD;
her schoolmate at her side. A servant ushered her into the&#xD;
parlor; the obscurity was so great at first that she could&#xD;
see no one, but 'after an instant she saw Agnes rise, and&#xD;
slowly approach her from the farther end of the room. Her&#xD;
impulse was to run to her wish open arms, but at thisiack&#xD;
of eagerness in her friend's manner ~she desisted, and waited&#xD;
her coming wiTh an indefinable sensation of sorrow and re-&#xD;
proach. They kissed each other, and sat down in silence,&#xD;
ere either could resolve to speak of common-places; but&#xD;
they did at length ask after each other's health, and the&#xD;
health of friends; Amy had partially related in her letters&#xD;
her mental conflicts relative to her position: she had often&#xD;
thought how she ~hou1d relate verbally~9o Agnes all the&#xD;
changes that had passed over her inward world, but there&#xD;
was no flow of frar~kness to her lips: an intangible barrier&#xD;
seemed to have risen up between them. Determined that&#xD;
she would not strengthen it she said, in an agitated voice,&#xD;
"You are changed, Agnes.! you are going away from me!&#xD;
You do not love .me as you did 1"&#xD;
Agnes hastily clasped her to her heart, and kissed Ler,&#xD;
murmuring, "love you, darling ~ I do love you deeply, but&#xD;
I am altered as you say-so altered that you may go from&#xD;
me, rather than I from you. I have that to tell you, which&#xD;
n~ay cost me your friendship. I have desired to tell you&#xD;

&#xD;
could not go on speaking; she rose. and walked the floor to&#xD;
regain her calmness. "Come with me to my room !" she&#xD;
said, after a moment. Amy followed her: when they reached&#xD;
the luxurious chamber, Agnes locked the door, and passing&#xD;
h&amp;amp;r arm around her friend, seated herself with her on a&#xD;
divan. Her resolute will gave her a steady voice. "You&#xD;
may ~wt agree with me, Amy," she began, "but you will&#xD;
not judge me as the world will: you know me intimately;&#xD;
you will give me credit f4r honesty of purpose at least-&#xD;
you' will believe that I am true to such principles as my&#xD;
reason approvess"&#xD;
A~ the utmost, Amy only expected to hear her say that&#xD;
she had become a complete convert to Mrs. Collins' system&#xD;
of Free Love; a cloud of regret passed over her counten-&#xD;
ance, but she pressed 'the hand of Agnes, anti waited.&#xD;
"I love Mr. Ashley, and I shall proclaim myself his wife.&#xD;
I am such in the sight of heaven !" was firmly enunciated.&#xD;
Amy started as if an earthquake had opened at her feet:&#xD;
then for five 'minutes a dead silence prevailed. "A ~nes,"&#xD;
she uttered at length, "For' your reputation's sake," for your&#xD;
friends' sake, for your immortal soul's sake, recover from&#xD;
this delusion! It will drag you down from every hope of&#xD;
heaven. It will cast you upon the world a lost woman !"&#xD;
"' You don't understand me, Amy. I am a truer woman&#xD;
than I everwas before. I am on higher ground !" returned&#xD;
Agnes with singular composure; her high color alone be-&#xD;
tray ing excitement. "The assertion may sound 'arrogant,&#xD;
but I believe that I have higher truth than you. I shall give&#xD;
&#xD;
myself up to be burned at the stake of public opinion. I&#xD;
shall drink every bitter draught the world can offer me, but&#xD;
I shall not waver. I shall live with Mr. Ashley! Tell me',&#xD;
now, have .1 your friendship, or not? Know me. as I am,&#xD;
and choose !"&#xD;
Without hesitation, Amy laid both hands in those of&#xD;
Agnes, and then burying her face on her shoulder, wept&#xD;
with abandonment, "I will cling to you until death,&#xD;
Agnes! you are sincere, but oh! how terribly wrong !"&#xD;
"I believe you will think ,as I do, Amy, ere tong. You&#xD;
must see as I do, for you are liberal in your ~very nature."&#xD;
"No! you are blinded by passion , and I still have my&#xD;
reason~ left. I have no confidence in Mr. Ashley-he is&#xD;
worldly and sensual; he is not an enthusiast like you!&#xD;
'You are his victim-he is your seducer !".&#xD;
"Amy! I cannot hear such language !" Agnes spoke With&#xD;
icy decision. "There is not on~ woman in a thousand, who&#xD;
is so true a wife as I am. You don't know Mr. Ashley:&#xD;
he is the noblest being I ever met; he loves me with the&#xD;
pent-up feeling of years; with perfect purity."&#xD;
"So all women believe! so they have said for centuries,&#xD;
going down, to infamy with the words on their lips !"&#xD;
"Infamy !"&#xD;
"Yes! what you call virtue, the world calls imfamy.&#xD;
Agnes! I comprehend how you have, succeeded 'in deceiv-&#xD;
ing yourself !-you are so' shrouded in the mist of fallacy,&#xD;
that you seem to believe your seduction will take a different&#xD;
name from that of others. I will speak truth to you now,&#xD;

as I expect to meet you at the judgment bar of heaven.&#xD;
You will simply be Mi; Ashley's mistress to every one&#xD;

"No more!" whispered Agnes, with uplifted hand-her&#xD;
countenance was haughty in its sudden paleness, yet its an-&#xD;
guish sniote Amy with remorse.&#xD;
"Take my ci~ue1ty for the motive's sake !" she entreated.&#xD;
"You have he~4rd Mrs. Collins and Mr. Ashley talk until&#xD;
you have lost all true ideas of the world's judgmeiit. You&#xD;
must have youz~ eyes opened! you must be saved from this&#xD;
error! J cannot live unless you are saved. 0, Agnes!&#xD;
I have so loved and honored you! I have thought you so&#xD;
superior to myself. I could brave almost anything rather&#xD;
than see you prostrate as you are, your fine intellect de-&#xD;
throned, your once clear perceptions lost, your tender re-&#xD;
gard for others trampled upon by this evil passion. I have&#xD;
spoken of the world's judgment, not because I think that&#xD;
the most important consideration, but because you are in-&#xD;
fatuated in regard to it, and cannot see' what it will be.&#xD;
Those who love you will deem you deluded, and those who&#xD;
do not will deem you fallen."&#xD;
"I will have patience! it is the first draught! Goon!"&#xD;
came from Agnes' lips, ~s she sat with her eyes upon her&#xD;
companion. "You denounce as wrong the deepest aid&#xD;
holiest feelings of my, soul."&#xD;
"Would holy feelings condemn 'Mrs. Ashley to torture ?"&#xD;
"She does not love him !"&#xD;
"You and he can force her on the rack of torture never&#xD;
&#xD;
theless. Can God look upon you at this work with&#xD;
approval ?"&#xD;
"You have no idea ~of her violent and selfish character,&#xD;
Amy! She only cares to debar Mr. Ashley his single&#xD;
happiness, and that is found with me."&#xD;
" What is more nittural? then she knows it !"&#xD;
"Yes! she has long suspected it, and one week ago, when&#xD;
I gave Mr. Ashley my promise to cast my lot with his, he&#xD;
proposed to leave his sumptuous home in her possession!"&#xD;
"lie will forsake his children?"&#xD;
"He will leave them with her; he is so bei/ievolent that&#xD;
he is willing to grant her every happiness in his power."&#xD;
"Do your uncle and aunt know that you are going to&#xD;
live with him ?"&#xD;
"No! I shall let them know tomorrow. They know&#xD;
that I love him; Mrs. Ashley came to see them the day&#xD;
Mr. Aakley left hei~, and she denounced me to them by&#xD;
every vile name lips can utter. I simply told them that I&#xD;
loved him, and made no response to other questions."&#xD;
"Does it not touch your heart to wound so deeply the&#xD;
relatives who have taken pride in you, Agnes ?"&#xD;
"I shall explain my views at length to them, and they&#xD;
will not suffer deeply on my account."&#xD;
"I cannot believe that; you are driving a sharp knife to&#xD;
the core of your aunt's heart-she loves you as if you wero&#xD;

"0, Agnes! I fear the harm you are doing your soul,&#xD;
t~~ore than I fear the loss of your spotless name. I fear the&#xD;
A~parture of the Christ-like spirit that you once possessed.&#xD;
I t~'ear to see you blot the glory of the future that might 'be&#xD;
yours, for the blind enjoyment of a day. Since you have&#xD;
yielded to this affection, the happiness of 'others weighs as&#xD;
nothing against your own. 'He that would save his life&#xD;
shall lose it' says Holy Writ. You allow Mr. Ashley to&#xD;
prefer himself in ceasing to cherish the wife whom he wed.&#xD;
ded at the altar?"&#xD;
"She is not his wife; he hates her."&#xD;
"Jesus says, 'Love your enemies.' You 'encourage him&#xD;
in hating her, rather than in looking mercifully upon' her.&#xD;
Can your soul be in unison with his, when, he possesses no&#xD;
religion, no principle, no spii'it of paternal sacrifice? can you&#xD;
permit yourself to' love a man who can abandon hi~ own&#xD;
offspring ?-who loves wine and horses and hThdsome&#xD;
women ?-.who "-~--Amy hesItated, then said, "who has se-&#xD;
duced one misguided girl before you ?"&#xD;
A viVid blush passed over the face of Agnes: she did&#xD;
not reply for many minutes, then she said, steadily:&#xD;
"What you say is entirely false, Amy., You have been&#xD;
misinformed: I will no longer hear him aspersed by you.&#xD;
Speak of some other theme, or we must part now. Yet&#xD;
tell me huw you heard this base story."&#xD;
"From one to whom Mrs. Ashley 'told it 1" Amy arose&#xD;
&#xD;
266&#xD;
&#xD;
267&#xD;
&#xD;
as she spoke the' words, 'or we must part flow,' stinging&#xD;
her to the quick: she went toward the door, but a miser-&#xD;
able, impotent yearning held her back: she looke~l around&#xD;
with streaming eyes, s~iying, "I never believed that we&#xD;
should thus divide? thus take our separate ways of life.&#xD;
The irrevocable rnu.Tnot, cannot take place between us!&#xD;
Forgive the 'frankne~ that is born of love! Remember, 1 say&#xD;

They were locked in eadi other's embrace. "This is so&#xD;
bitter! If you understood rjne, A my, I could bear the in is-&#xD;
apprehension of those on whom 1 have lavished little love."&#xD;
"Agnes! my good, toy noble Agnes !" besought Amy as&#xD;
she stroked her hair, and pityingly kissed her brow.&#xD;
"Wait one mouth hefbre you take the step you contem-&#xD;

&#xD;
"No! No !" sighed Agnes, tiot releasing herself from&#xD;
her friend's arms. " To live one year with Mr. Ashley, 1,&#xD;
would consent that all the rest of my life should be steeped&#xD;
in wretchedness."&#xD;
"Poor Agnes! what sane person would make such a&#xD;
bargain !"&#xD;
"It is right. I have prayed for hours to see aright, and&#xD;
the blessed affirmation came at last with startling convic-&#xD;
tion. It would be a sin for him to live with Mrs. Ashley&#xD;
sin for me not to devote myself to him."&#xD;
"When you first accepted his admiration, the enemy en-&#xD;
tered into yu, Agnes. had you turned away then, when&#xD;
you had strength,. you would not have grown so infatuated."&#xD;
You have never loved, Amy; it has elevated my whole&#xD;
nature: it has 'elevated Mr. Ashley's."&#xD;
"Agnes! I shall never cease to believe you one of the&#xD;
most intrinsically 'chaste women I have ever seen. You&#xD;
cannot believe how much sensualism there is in Mr. Ash-&#xD;
Icy's att;ichment for you; if you were c6arser, you could&#xD;
believe it more easily."&#xD;
"Unju~t ! unjust !"&#xD;
'~ I give him credit for many noble qualities; he has&#xD;
great natural benevolence and generosity, but I do not be-&#xD;
lieve he will be faithful to you, except as Louis Fourteenth&#xD;
was constant to Madame Maintenon, or Henry Eighth to&#xD;
Catharine Pair. He is too old to expect devotion like&#xD;
yours again !"&#xD;
"It would be easier to forsake his own soul !" Agnes did&#xD;
&#xD;
268&#xD;
&#xD;
not look haughty or impatient: she looked eiitirelv fixed in&#xD;
purpose, and it passed into Amy's thought that no knife-&#xD;
stroke of hers could cut the chains of her soul-bondage.&#xD;
She abandoned her arguments-and casting herself upon&#xD;
the floor, buried her face in the divan ~nd wept over the&#xD;
broken friendship that could never be riveted, except by&#xD;
congeniality of sentiment and feeling': the cravina&#xD;
impulse&#xD;
of affection would not be silenced-she had so fe~V to love,&#xD;
and she had loved Agnes so 'well.&#xD;
Agnes sat down beside her. "Remember our days of&#xD;
happy sympathy, Agnes !" sh~ said, looking up, "remem~&#xD;
ber how we used to pace the piazza at school, and dream&#xD;
out our future! Remember me in love, and do not look at&#xD;
me through the pain I have given you. I would pluck it alL&#xD;
out, if it can do no good.. Our lives can nevef' bear the ~'ela.&#xD;
~ion to each other that they did: you go from me. I cannot&#xD;
help going from you. how cai~ we meet, without frank-&#xD;
ness, and that Will distress both. Yet I shall come to see&#xD;
you sometimes, and my heart and arms will always be&#xD;
open to you,!" she could not 'bring herself to ask where&#xD;
Agnes would be found, after she went to live with her lover.&#xD;
The room was enveloped in darkness; so intently had&#xD;
the' thoughts of the two been engaged, that they had not&#xD;
noticed the flight of time. Amy started up ifl amazement,&#xD;
saying "I must go this instant~ !" After a hasty good bye,&#xD;
she opened the door and started to go down stairs followed&#xD;
by her companion.&#xD;
"Let me send a servant with you, Amy !" said Agnes.&#xD;

&#xD;
* Amy laid her finger on her lip and listened involuntarily,&#xD;
as a too familiar voice reached her from the parlor. It was&#xD;
that of Mr. Second. A light laugh from Mrs. Collins ensued,&#xD;
and then careless fingers ran over the keys of the piano.&#xD;
"I ~c~h~tely h~we th~ blues to-night, if I do langh!"&#xD;
said Mrs. Collins' voice. "Shall I play for you, Mr. Sooord,&#xD;
and thus cheer myself V'&#xD;
"Yes! play and sing both !"&#xD;
Then commenced a soft sweet harmony; Mrs. Collins&#xD;
was a skilful musician. Amy did, not w~iit to hez~r hei' rich,&#xD;
delicious voice; she waved Agnes back with an imperative&#xD;
gestu~'e, and then stole swiftly and silently down the stairs,&#xD;
and through the lighted hall, without attracting the atten-&#xD;
tion which she deprecated. She went out into the street&#xD;
alone; ~she felt forsaken, and a jealous anger rose in her&#xD;
heart against Mrs. Collins: her lip curled scorn fully to&#xD;
find how soon Mr. Second solaced himself for her ldss, then&#xD;
she rebuked herself, and tho.~ght how it would console her&#xD;
to see him look upon her as kindly as of old. It was a&#xD;
dark, terrible world! Agnes had fallen by the wayside!&#xD;
she who stood a queen among women. Amy seemed to&#xD;
herselC as if staggering under the weight of a dream, as she&#xD;
threaded her way through the lonely streets to her home.&#xD;
She felt as if~she stood in a slippery place; she trembled&#xD;
lest in palliating the small beginnings of sin she might so&#xD;
befog her own mind, as to 'become incapable of distinguish..&#xD;
ingright and wrong, as Agnes had done: she put forth her&#xD;
arms unto God as one bewildered, and hesoug'ht his protec..&#xD;
&#xD;
tion. She thought of her meagre lot, at present uncharted&#xD;
by one ray of earthly splendor; the passionate love of&#xD;
Agnes had struck hei with amaze, yet it gave her a pained,&#xD;
quick consciousness of her own capacities in this direction.&#xD;
$h~ sighed out: "Almighty Father! let my heart be&#xD;
folded up for heaven, rather than led into selfishness and, sin&#xD;
by its affections. Teach me to b~ content with my duties&#xD;
-with a sister's love. Teach me gratitude that I may still&#xD;
walk in the path of innocence and truth--.walk onward to&#xD;
everlasting brightness." She repeated to herself verses&#xD;
that had often cheered her when she flagged in hope. They&#xD;
were thesc&#xD;
"I will hope forever, though pain and blighc&#xD;
O'er my pathway ceaseless roll,&#xD;
Fot I know that his name is Love and Light&#xD;
Who ruleth o'er the whole.&#xD;
And it seemeth but little, in all the count,&#xD;
What shadows are on our way,&#xD;
So the light of our being shall only mount&#xD;
To the pure and perfect day.&#xD;
The purer and clearer if all be won,&#xD;
For the clouds that cradled the carly gun.&#xD;
Bring pain and sadness with all their thorns,&#xD;
I will drink the bitter cup,&#xD;
So the light of my spirit be like the morn s~&#xD;
Forever ascending up!&#xD;
Be it hidden by earth-clouds, ~nd donned with tears,&#xD;
Be its glory paled awhile,&#xD;
If it only burst from the gloom at last&#xD;
In the great All-Father's ~rnile!&#xD;
And come what may of 'woe to me&#xD;
I will hope throi~gh all that this sh~ll be."&#xD;

AMY DENBROOK.&#xD;
She reached home, and as she passed through the hall to her&#xD;
room, she heard Dr. Kendrick's happy laugh in the parlor&#xD;
and some playful words that fell from Isabel's lips. Again&#xD;
she felt forsaken; her pathway seemed lined on either side&#xD;
by human beings who tasted the poetry of existence. She,&#xD;
in her strange craving for a perfect destiny, had twice&#xD;
dashed away an insufficient draught: others were easily&#xD;
satisfied, why was not she?&#xD;
Arrived in her room, she tossed her bonuct upon the bed,&#xD;
and falling upon her knees abandoned herself to the most&#xD;
ardent grayer: she implored, that it might be her work to&#xD;
win Agnes back from her error: that she might not weary&#xD;
although years might elapse ere success came. She entreat-&#xD;
ed for a charitable judgn~~~t, for her pQwer to see clearly,-&#xD;
for strength to keep the narrow way herself.&#xD;
When at eleven o'clock, Isabel came from, the parlor,&#xD;
Amy had retired, but she had not closed her eyes; for&#xD;
three hours they talked about Agiies, about Mr. S~~rd and&#xD;
Mrs. Collins, and about Dr. Kendrick, then Isabel dropped&#xD;
asleep. Amy's brain was too b~isy with thoughts which&#xD;
she hoped might weigh with Agi-ies, to grow weary;&#xD;
thought trooped upon thought, bdpe upon hope, until flush-&#xD;
ed with eagerness2 she sat up in bed~ and ran over in her&#xD;
mind such arguments as she believed were perfectly con-&#xD;
vincing. Poor child! she had not learned that love some-&#xD;
times annihilates reason, and revolves only around its own&#xD;
center, ignoring every other. At daybreak she was sleep.&#xD;
ing prc~Ioundly. Isabel ~hook her gently and bade her get&#xD;
&#xD;
ready for breakfast: finding this had no effect she dropped&#xD;
a little water on her forehead.&#xD;
"Oh, Bel, you 'ye perfectly heartless!" she dreamily said,&#xD;
covering her face.&#xD;
"But you know, Aipy, that w~ must get that embroid-&#xD;
ered band done by twelve o'ci9ck. if we don't keep our&#xD;
engagCm9nt5~ they wont give us ~ny moi'e work !"&#xD;
This was sufficient: Amy had entirely forgotten that her&#xD;
life was that of a seamstress.L ~he arose, and workedd&#xD;
diligently until the embroidery wa~ finished, then she&#xD;
dressed herself for the street, and after her errand at the&#xD;
fancy store was d9ne, she bent her steps to Mrs. IIarring~-&#xD;
ton's. She dreaded to go, to meet Agnes, and speak words&#xD;
that were painful to both; but her conscience would not&#xD;
release her from this duty: she felt that it would eternally&#xD;
reproach her, if she did hot use every faculty of her mind,&#xD;
to prevent her friend from taking the plunge from which&#xD;
no woman nse~. Alas! after she had left Agnes, the night&#xD;
before, every arrangement had been made for an elope-&#xD;
ment. Miss Leonard had gone with Mrs. Collins to the&#xD;
ho~se of a mutual friend, over whom the latter had great&#xD;
influence. In a back parlor Mr. Ashley waited .to con~mu-&#xD;
nicate with his victim. As she entered the room, he came&#xD;
forward, and clasped her to. his heart, wPh passionate&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"Is it over ?" she interrogated, looking in his face with&#xD;
hope and apprehension.&#xD;
"It is over !" he answered. "I have left. her! I have&#xD;

'r To-morrow ?" she repeated, yet not with fLltering. The&#xD;
fatal morrow came, and wit~j it Mr. Ashley took from her&#xD;
native land, Agnes Leonard.&#xD;
Unaware of this, Amy went to Mrs. JIarritigtou's~ A&#xD;
servant admitted her with the exclaination, "0, Miss Amy,&#xD;
it's sorry news you'll hear! Miss Agnes has run away&#xD;
with a married mane! The mistress hinted when she found&#xD;
it out."&#xD;
"Where is Mrs. Jlarrington ?" questioned Afr~y faintly.&#xD;
"She's in bed, the poor lady! oh! if you'd seen the mas-&#xD;
ter! you know it's a jolly man he is-~---but he looks like a,&#xD;
ghost. It's little breakfast or dinner that's been eaten to-&#xD;

"jI won't intrude on Mrs. Ilarrington to-day, Mary.&#xD;

Mr. Harri ngton suddenly appeared from the parlor.&#xD;
"have you helped to craze that girl w~th this inferi~al Free&#xD;
Loveism ?" he asked in a ster excited tone. "Mary !" he&#xD;
painted to the kitchen stairs, t ward which Mary travelled&#xD;
with p~'ecipitation.&#xD;
Forgiving his rudeness, Amy~ answered, "I abl~or it fi'om&#xD;

"Excuse my savageness, Amy. I believe I'm not in my&#xD;

down rapidly. Amy was turning the knob of the door,&#xD;
when he stopt before her, saying: "What do you know of&#xD;
that Mrs. Collins ?"&#xD;
"Nothing, except that she is an advocate of the views&#xD;
that have misled Agnes."&#xD;
"That woman is rotten to the core: to the very core!&#xD;
that woman is lost to virtue. I believe it as firmly as if I&#xD;
could prove it !-and I will prove it. I'll track her until I&#xD;
find out all her anteceAents. Never until I learned it from&#xD;
Agnes' letter this morning, did I know she was ,disseminat-&#xD;
ing her poison in my house. I'll find her out, and then I'll&#xD;
send Agnes a history of the woman whom she has trusted&#xD;
beyond her own kindred. Agnes never darkens my door&#xD;
again. She has made her bed, she must lie in it."'&#xD;
An~y stood in embarrassed silence. Tears of grief and&#xD;
excitement roIled down her cheeks.&#xD;
"Go up stairs and comfort my wife 1" he said more&#xD;
softly. "Your sympathy will do her more good than my&#xD;
anger." He went into the parlor, and Amy went to Mrs.&#xD;
Harrington' s room with hesitation: she tapped very lightly&#xD;
at the door, and a low "Come in !" gave her admission.&#xD;
At sight of her, Mrs. Harrington burst into a fres~ flood&#xD;
of tears, for it was :evident from her appearance tl~at she&#xD;
had been weeping profusely. She sat in an easy chair, care-&#xD;
lessly clad in a wrapper.&#xD;

('hair beside her, "or I would not have ventured into youi&#xD;

"I am restless anywhere, Amy. You know our trouble&#xD;
of course&#xD;
"Yes !"&#xD;
"Did Agnes confide in you ?"&#xD;
"Not until yesterday afternoon! and then she told me&#xD;
that you would know all to-day! I had no idea that she&#xD;
was going to elope so soon."&#xD;
"Mr. llarrington is so excited that it distressesme to see&#xD;
him, lie says he would a~k no greater privilege than to&#xD;
blow Mr. Ashley's brains oi~t. It is well thatMrs. collins&#xD;
is out of the house !"&#xD;
"Then she is gone ?" Amy quickly said.&#xD;
"Yes! the deceitful woman! I supposed that Agnes was&#xD;
only going to ride a little distance with her, to the house of&#xD;
other friends in the city: Mrs. Collins, bade rni~ 'good bye'&#xD;
with the coolest suavity, and told me smilingly that she had&#xD;
borrowed a large trunk belonging to Agnes, as her ward-&#xD;
robe had increased of late, but she would return it in a day&#xD;
or two. I have discovered that she packed up Agnes clothess&#xD;
in it, and she went with her to the wharf where a pilot boat&#xD;
lay, that was to take Agnes and Mr~ Ashley to a packet&#xD;
ship: they have gone to Europe. Here is her fatal letter !"&#xD;
Mrs. Harrington handed a closely writtenn manuscript to&#xD;
Amy, who read it eagerly: There was a singular excite-&#xD;
ment in it~Vhere were no regrets, some affectionate express.&#xD;
sion, and, a tone of superiority all through: it spoke of free.&#xD;
C&#xD;
&#xD;
dom in love and marriage, 6f individual sovereignty, and of&#xD;
the rapid advances that the world was making toward truth,&#xD;
whose waters were rising higher and higher; they might be&#xD;
a little discoloi~ed at present, but they ~yould become clear&#xD;
until all men should discover a pearly and pure foundation&#xD;
The letter closed with the expressed conviction that her&#xD;
aunt would soon sympathize with her.&#xD;
"Isn't it pitiable ?" asked Mrs. 1larringto1~, as Amy l~iid&#xD;
it down.&#xD;
"Too pitiable! but she is so ~adly self-deceived !-~so&#xD;
fearfully honest that God must lead her to hirn~elf at last:&#xD;
lie can see why lIe should have mercy, when we can only&#xD;
see occasion to grieve and tremble. Will you meet her as&#xD;
a relative if she ever comes back ?"&#xD;
"1 shall, but my husband says she shall never re-enter&#xD;
the door she has so heartlessly left. In time I think I can&#xD;
make him comprehend the sophistries by which she has de-&#xD;
luded herself. You know it is more difficult for a man to&#xD;
understand her, than for us. lie classes her with profligate&#xD;
~ thinks we ha~~e always been deceived in tier,&#xD;
and that she never was so pure as the majority of young&#xD;
girls."&#xD;
"That is a cruel mistake !"&#xD;
"You see in her letter she says she wishes her friends to&#xD;
know her view~, and the mode of life which she has calmly&#xD;
chosen from the deliberate deductions of her reason. Alas!&#xD;
she believes her judgment never was ~o blinded by affection&#xD;
and excitement. She says she will do nothing in secret,&#xD;

that she is not willing should be proclaimed upo~i the&#xD;
housetops. Mr. Ilarrington says that is only a bold strike&#xD;
to appea~ as well as she can, after having plunged~ liersojf as&#xD;
low as sl~e could reach: while the w~rld could be deceived,&#xD;
e kept silent, but when she chooses self gratification on&#xD;

"I believe she thought of nothing but her love, and that&#xD;
she seiz~d~anything that seemed to justify it, and turned it&#xD;

CHAPTER~ XXIV.&#xD;
IN a lovely English cottage, situated in the suburbs of&#xD;
London, Marcus Leonard lived with his fair young wife,&#xD;
and baby daughter: there was a quit melody flowing&#xD;
through their simple lives, which alternated with unrest on&#xD;
the husband's part: his commercial business was not of an&#xD;
absorbing character, and it left him time to think-to feel&#xD;
that he was not sufficiently engaged in such labors as his&#xD;
head, heart and hand fitted him for: his thinking and feel..&#xD;
ino* brought about some favorable results, but the disparity&#xD;
between what he could do, and did do, was often great, it&#xD;
pressed upon him with a heaviness that impelled him toa&#xD;
sudden start in the field -of benevolence. Sylvia did not&#xD;
comprehend this style of experience: she never thought it&#xD;
was a wife's privilege to quicken the heart of her husband&#xD;
to such schemes as his 'brain could execute. She had a&#xD;
sweet smile for him when he happened to relate with some&#xD;
enthusiasm that he had just passed an evening with two or&#xD;
three gentlemen who desired his co-operation in a benevolent&#xD;
enterprise: this sweet smile of hers pleased him, but the&#xD;

next evening that he went to meet the aforesaid gentlemen,&#xD;
she would turn her lovely thee regretfully toward him, say~&#xD;
lug, "0, are you~ going to leave me alone? please hurry&#xD;
back, Marcus, do !"&#xD;
It must be confessed that he sometimes closed the door&#xD;
and his lips in silence at this, and stalked away with a&#xD;
chafed feeling', wishing that his wife were a help, rather than&#xD;
a hindrance to hi~ weak virtue. A half hour's reflection&#xD;
however, never failed to restore the little wife to her proper&#xD;
position in his mind, as a child who was to be guided safely&#xD;
by him to heaven: he almost invariably returned to her&#xD;
with tenderness in his dark eyes, and the gentlest encourage&#xD;
ment in the stroke of his hand upon her hair. 11e was hasty&#xD;
in temper, naturally severe in expression when his anger&#xD;
wa~ excited; the profound grief of Sylvia at a quick tone,&#xD;
Gr sharp look had in 'a great measure cured him of this&#xD;
tendency: she grew to love all things that tended heaven.&#xD;
ward as he did, almost without being aware of the great&#xD;
change that had been slowly wrought in herself: she leaned&#xD;
greatly upon those around her) and measurably became&#xD;
such as their influence made her; realizing this, her husband&#xD;
sought to strengthen her, until the fibres of her soul should&#xD;
enclasp as of themselves the divine truths which might sup-&#xD;
port her. The shock which had seized him upon discover-&#xD;
ing her unlikene4s to his ideal Sylvia had passed away !~&#xD;
so had the delicious poetry of his passion, but a fondness'&#xD;
reniained, taking its hue from the early love; it was cher-&#xD;
ished, by her deep tenderness~although to him the witchery&#xD;
&#xD;
of Jove had departed, ~angels perceived in his patient self-&#xD;
forgetfulness a higher element than entered into his&#xD;
'ooing: they saw that his mistaken marriage was one of&#xD;
those providential circumstances which God uses to lead&#xD;
soulS forward into heavenly places.&#xD;
One day the lovely babe was brought into the parlor&#xD;
fresh from her bath: mother and child formed a beautiful&#xD;
picture as they sat by the open window about which trailed&#xD;
late autumn vines: the day was warm for the season:&#xD;
Sylvia pointed out to the baby the loaded wains that pasted&#xD;
through the meadow and entered upon the winding ro d.&#xD;
Mr. Leonard took the little one, saying, " i'll carry h~r&#xD;
about the lawn, and show her. the artemisias."&#xD;
"0, papa, she'll take cold unless I wrap her up."&#xD;
"Fie, Sylvia, you never give her fresh air! Here! ill&#xD;
E&#xD;
this answer?' be caught up a gossamer handkerchief and&#xD;
threw it over the child's head.&#xD;
"Marcus, it is too early in the day to take her out.,&#xD;
Please mind what I say !"&#xD;
"I'll compromise! You may wrap her up to your&#xD;
heart's content. You have ,a mania for preserving May's&#xD;
life, when it is perfectly secure I"&#xD;
Sylvia darted to the table exclaiming, "A letter came for&#xD;
you yesterday afternoon, but I forgot to give it to you !"&#xD;
lie paid no attention to the document, thinking it a ruse,&#xD;
but settled his regard~ upon his daughter.&#xD;
"This is your uncle Harrington's writing! I mean to&#xD;
read it myself 1" proceeded Sylvia, inserting her delicate&#xD;

"I.~ that a letter ~OU little, witch ?" with the words, May&#xD;
was deposited in her mother's arms, and he received the&#xD;
letter: he took ~ chair by the window, and unfolding it,&#xD;
read the following:'&#xD;
"My DEAR NEPHEW :-lt is my misfortune to communi..&#xD;
cate most unhappy intelligence. Agnes has eloped with&#xD;
Mr. Clinton Ashlpy~: they will probably be in France when&#xD;
this reaches you. I enclose you her address, which she left&#xD;
in a letter to your aunt. Go to her at once, and tear her&#xD;
from the villain, if it be possible-but do not return her to&#xD;
her friends here, as it would be an unhappy situation for&#xD;
her and them. You will see that her life should henceforth&#xD;
be passed among strai~ gers. You have m~r profiundest&#xD;
sympathy. We are ov ~rwhelmed with trouble at this oc-&#xD;
currence, as you will be God support you, as He has not&#xD;
supported me under this ~blow! Write as soon as you have&#xD;
seen her.             I&#xD;
"Your affectionate uncle,&#xD;
"JOHN IIARRINUTON."&#xD;
Marcus Leonard sat dumb and pale for a half hour after&#xD;
his eye had encotintered this revelation, save that twice he&#xD;
lifted the letter and' reread it. Once he sThiled a ghastly,&#xD;
derisive smile, and passed his hand over his brow, pushing&#xD;
back his hair, as if to find out whether he dreamed, or was&#xD;
&#xD;

S&#xD;
&#xD;
still a safe man ; he at length arose, and walked the floor&#xD;
he touched the mantle, and removed a little dirt with his&#xD;
fingers; ah ! it told him that he was in waking life. He&#xD;
looked towards his wife and child ; the former had watched&#xD;
him in vague terror, as she had seen his pallid features&#xD;
stiffen into fiei'ce severity, as if he were bracing himself for&#xD;
conflict With deadly suffering; he sat down again, for a con-&#xD;
fused darkness gathered over his brain, and his heart beat&#xD;
with a choking pain, as it rose to ,its momentary task,&#xD;
panting for freedom.&#xD;
"May I read the ktter ?" timidly questioned the wife,&#xD;
with whom curiosity was an active trait ; she had not the&#xD;
tact to know that she should seem unobserving for a little&#xD;
season; she picked it up from the carpet, where it had&#xD;
fallen, and turned upon him her steady, anxious look. He&#xD;
turned away his face restlessly, and then walked to the&#xD;
window as if unconscious of his movements. After the&#xD;
lapse of five minutes, Sylvia held out the letter, repeating~&#xD;
"May I read it, Marcus ?"&#xD;
He nodded an impatient affirmative, ~nd then entered&#xD;
his chamber to be, alone ; it chafed him to be spoken to on&#xD;
the matter before his shaken mind was steadied.&#xD;
Sylvia read the letter through, and turned pale with the&#xD;
shock it gave her. She wrung her little hands together,&#xD;
with the cry "Gracious !" and then sat lost ii~i thought for&#xD;
several minutes before she continued. "What is the world&#xD;
coming to ~ 1 always thought she was so much' better and&#xD;
wiser than 1, and now to think she should have turned out&#xD;

&#xD;
in this way! P.ior Marcus! it will make him so sober, he&#xD;
wont notice baby and me in ever so long, I wish I could&#xD;
comfort him, but when he gets b it seems as&#xD;
thinking'  hard,&#xD;
if he wanted to put me away until he had finished ; he goes&#xD;
by himself until he gets all right, and then he comes to me,&#xD;
as if I had no wise counsel for his hour of greatest need&#xD;
when I am troubled, if he caresses me, it takes it almost&#xD;
all away. I suppose he prays when he is alone."&#xD;
This supposition Was not incorrect, ftr as Mr. Leonard in&#xD;
his solitude, dropt upon a chair and bowed his head on a,&#xD;
table, appeals of questioning went up to the throne of God;&#xD;
they would scarcely be called prayers. lIe had been very&#xD;
proud of Agnes; he had spoken of her to the English&#xD;
friends, whom he most valued, and had confidently expected&#xD;
to present her to~ them some time when she should visit&#xD;
him. But flQW ! the crimson burned in his emples to&#xD;
think of this; he did not believe her story co Id be kept&#xD;
secret, and the sneer and scorn that would awai her, stung&#xD;
him intolerably, as his imaginatiQ1~ pictured thet ; he ~as&#xD;
fastidious regarding ~lelicacy in women ; he kn w how his&#xD;
own censure fell upon such as did not possess it n manner&#xD;
alone; how then would reputation light upon one who had&#xD;
discarded it altogether, and had embraced a Ii of open&#xD;
adultery ! There was a deeper source of misery to him,&#xD;
and this was the reflection that she had harmed her own&#xD;
spirit; he had no clue to the sophistries by which she had&#xD;
travelled to her present position; the stupendous fact alone&#xD;
stared at him; she was a fallen woman; one light gleamed&#xD;
&#xD;
through the gloom, and that was the hope that she might be&#xD;
rescued and restored to her former ~el.f. The thought of&#xD;
disowning or discarding her never crossed his mind ; her&#xD;
eternal good lay deepest in his heart, yet a flame of pa~on&#xD;
blazed in his cheek, to realize that no consideration for her&#xD;
kindred had held her back. lie was angered that his uncle&#xD;
refused even to receive her, and yet stayed his reproach'&#xD;
when he remembered that Mr. Harrington was a type of&#xD;
many worldly men, and that one in a thousand would.&#xD;
scarcely have acted differently ; those who make the world&#xD;
an~ idol, rarely treat the fallen as if God could redeem them.&#xD;
Mr. Leonard suddenly entered the sitting-room, saying,&#xD;
"I am going to France to-day, Sylvia. I must leave imme-&#xD;
diately 1" his grey eyes looked densely black, and the&#xD;
former paleness of his cheek was supplanted by a fevered&#xD;
glow. Syhia wa~ kneeling on -the floor as he spoke,&#xD;
d4r~gling ~ne long ouri within reach of the baby's hand, and&#xD;
then withdrawing it-she ceased this pantomine, as the&#xD;
chamber door opened, and rose to her feet, encountering her&#xD;
husband's look with one as grave.&#xD;
" When shall you come back, dear ?" she questioned~&#xD;
"In a ~ay or two! Good 1~ye!" he passed his arm&#xD;
around her, and kissed her forehead.&#xD;
"But shan't I put something in your portn-ianteaii?" she&#xD;
inquired as he lifted his beautiful infant in hIs arms for a&#xD;
last caress.&#xD;
"No! No'! I want nothing. I may bring Agnes back&#xD;
with me to live9 What do you say to that '?"&#xD;

Her countenance fell, but she i~esponded, "That is just as&#xD;
you say, Marcus, but-~"&#xD;
But 'vhat ?"&#xD;
'~Vhat will people say, if they find out about her ?"&#xD;
"That is not the question, Sylvia. This is the best home&#xD;
for her !" ~IIe left the house without an added word, aiid&#xD;
Sylvia sunk into a chair, and began to cry; the decision and&#xD;
sternness of his manner pained her; her heart did not leap&#xD;
at the hope of Agnes' deliverance; it sunk to think she&#xD;
could never praise or defend her: she felt within herself a&#xD;
shuddering reserve toward the strange girl: it sprang from&#xD;
a total incapacity to understand her; the boldness and im-&#xD;
morality of the step were inexplicable. Letters to Marcus,&#xD;
which 'revealed so fully the character of Agnes gave no in-&#xD;
sight into the' nature of the affection which had governed&#xD;
her. Sylvia r~proaehed her husband in thought, and con-&#xD;
sidered him unkind in his intention of bringing then-i to-&#xD;
gether. This was not unnatural, for it is proverbial that&#xD;
wives are not partial to forming a household with their hus-&#xD;
band's relatives~ it is more agecable to do as one wishes,&#xD;
unchecked aiid 4iwatched.&#xD;
Speedy       brought Mr. Le~nard to an 'old chateau,&#xD;
not many miles from Paris;, he did not stQp to note the&#xD;
grey old stone of the building, nor the lacing of a thousand&#xD;
ivy-vines about the deeply imbedded windows ; the pleasant&#xD;
paths and grand old trees, arid distant view of river, hill&#xD;
and field, purpling under the setting sun, had for him no&#xD;
meaning; the fragrance of vineyards scented the air, and&#xD;
&#xD;
when he had ascended the sloping lawn, the perfume was&#xD;
borne to him like tender memories that rolled in upon him,&#xD;
and then passed away. As he advanced toward the arched&#xD;
entrance of the dwelling, he lifted his eyes at the sound of&#xD;
voices above him; they came from a balcony, where Agnes&#xD;
sat holding a book, and listening '~vith happy smiles to&#xD;
words from Mr. Ashley, who toyed with br~ids of her hair.&#xD;
A sudden exclamation' from her brother, called her attention&#xD;
to him; a rapid change passed over her countenance; almost&#xD;
at the same instant, she inclined her head, and breathing the&#xD;
word "Marcus !" she arose. In a moment more she had&#xD;
met him silently, and he had followed her to a small morn-&#xD;
ing re~in; they sat down, for their hearts only could be&#xD;
heard, as they strove for strength and calmness; neither&#xD;
could immediately over-power feeling~ After a hurried&#xD;
glance at her brother, Agnes looked out of the open&#xD;
window by which she sat; she was driving down the wild&#xD;
tumult that choked her, and serving ~herself for a defence of&#xD;
her conduct; her graceful figure grew more stately in its&#xD;
carriage, as she lifted her w hite hand to support her cheek;&#xD;
she was very simply dressed in a robe of tissue, whose pale&#xD;
lavender tint gave her an almost ethereal look ;. a rosy&#xD;
cloud from the western sky threw over her its soft attn os-&#xD;
pheric glow; she had grown thinner and paler since they&#xD;
had met, and had her inward nature suffered no change,&#xD;
Marcus would have said, lovelier in her intellectual beauty.&#xD;
Upon a small table near her lay a few books, a few minia-&#xD;
tures, and some embroidery. The volume of excitement&#xD;

had seemed to swell with every league that brought the'&#xD;
brother nearer his sister, and her seducer. At last he said,'&#xD;
"Agnes I" in a voice low with concentrated feeling.&#xD;
She turned to him with a mingled look of love and&#xD;
defiance, answering, "Do not 'you misjudge me, dear&#xD;
Marcus ii"&#xD;
"Misjudge you? are you x~ot then the paramour of Mr.&#xD;
Ashley ?-the mistress of a man of fashion'? Are you not&#xD;
GodA'orsaken? Are you not devil-possessed ?"&#xD;
She had not looked for the passion that broke from his&#xD;
tongue and eyes; he kept some rein upon himself, as was&#xD;
evident from the not loud intonation of his voice, yet&#xD;
never had she 'seen all the strong elements of his character&#xD;
so fiercely aroused; she had relied upon his respect for her&#xD;
and upon his knowledge of her native purity, and desire for&#xD;
actual truth4&#xD;
"Do you know me so imperfectly, Marcus ?" she whis-&#xD;
pered, "as to suppose I would act contrary to my con-&#xD;
science? IJow little you compreheiid me !"&#xD;
"What do you mean? what is there for me to compre-&#xD;
hend I" he interrogated quickly, as a faint, 'bewildering&#xD;
hope of some mistake broke into his mind.&#xD;
"Did you not receive a letter detailing my whole past&#xD;
history to you, with my present views ?"&#xD;
"I received no such letter U'&#xD;
"Marcus! I have heai'd you say that you did not dis-&#xD;
believe every man's spirit had a counterpart in some woman's&#xD;
spirit !"&#xD;

He nodded impatiently; she bowed her face upon the&#xD;
broad window-seat to gather up her strength, for a tide of&#xD;
qn(Tujsh shook her as with a chill.&#xD;
"Do you say, that that man is your counterpart? that&#xD;
you are mated to one like him ?" he arose, and walked the&#xD;
floor a moment, and then stopped befoPe her, regarding her&#xD;
with mournful compassion. Agnes ! your reason is shaI~en,&#xD;
You could not have acted thus, unless it were so. You are&#xD;
a dupe! You have been mesmerised! 'Let me take you to&#xD;
my home, sister? Let me c~irry you in my heart, and&#xD;
prove your shield against one who has crept in, serpent-like,&#xD;
and beguiled you of all that is lovely and of good report?"&#xD;
She looked up with a firm aspect, even with icy rebuke;&#xD;
her will stilled the trembling of her nerves. "Is it possi-&#xD;
ble, Marcus, that you can believe me guilty of an act un-&#xD;
worthy Agnes Leonard? I do not expect the multitude to&#xD;
understand me, but from you 1 have anticipated sympathy,&#xD;
patience, respect. I pardon your injustice to Mr. Ashley,&#xD;
believing you know nothing of his interior life and motives&#xD;
-to me he is almost god-like !'~&#xD;
A sharp, scornful laugh rang from her brother's lips-&#xD;
with 'such a laugh men sometimes receive tidings of misfor-&#xD;
tune.&#xD;
Agnes proceeded in a tone that would have cut through&#xD;
mountains, had it been physically embodied "In living&#xD;
'with Mr. Ashley, I am living out my highest idea of God's&#xD;
truth. I may not be his wife in the eyes of men, but I am. in&#xD;

other. I should be guilty of treachery to my highest per-&#xD;
ceptions of truth-I should outrage my holiest womanhood&#xD;
did I refrain froi~ accepting his love openly and proudly.&#xD;
Marcus dropt his head between his hands, for his soul&#xD;
writhed: he felt that if his spiritual sight could be opened,&#xD;
he should see his once loving sister surrounded by a band&#xD;
of persuasive demons to whom she was utterly obedient1 !-&#xD;
their tyranny was absolute; shehad listened to them, and&#xD;
they came in flocks to justify the love that she had cherish-&#xD;
ed; at first she had cherished it with a sense of its sin ;at~&#xD;
last with a sense of her incapacity to part with it-.and then&#xD;
the demon-crew exerted all their skill to counsel her as dis&#xD;
sembling angels of light. Not rarely do we meet with men&#xD;
and women who draw us within the spiritual sphere that en~&#xD;
compasses them, sometimes for good, and sometimes for&#xD;
evil; it behooves us to watch whether our natures are ole-&#xD;
vated or lowered by this contact. Agnes had been drawn&#xD;
within the influence of Mr. Ashley's nature; it wa~ fused&#xD;
throughout her own, until her former self was quiescent.&#xD;
This was also the case with him; her purity tempered his&#xD;
sensuality, and he uttered sentiments that would have&#xD;
astounded his *boon companions; yet was self-gratification&#xD;
his leading object, as it had ever been: it took a different&#xD;
form only, putting on the "harmonial, affinitive" type to&#xD;
suit his circumstances.&#xD;
Believing from her brother's silence and attitude that his&#xD;
mood was changed, Agnes continued in a less steadfast voice:&#xD;
"0, Marcus, if you had thought, and wept, and prayed for&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
t~'uth as I have done, Y0N' would believe me to be in a more&#xD;
exalted state than formerly. I strive to do good-I have&#xD;
x isit~d the p~1', and Mr. Ashley never refused to succor a&#xD;
suffering fellow creature; he would spend his thousands to&#xD;
flake those I love happy: hs cares for tfie least object that&#xD;
I regard. lie is worthy the esteem of one like you, and the&#xD;
time must come when you will accord it to him !"&#xD;
Marcus stifled his impatience at this, and said, "Truth&#xD;
is it Protean-visaged, Agnes? Is it to you one thing, and to&#xD;
me another? has the Creator left us to wander and stag-&#xD;
ger about in a labyrinth, with no rules 'for the conduct of a&#xD;
blameless life? No! he who runs may read, and wilful&#xD;
wrong alone on man's part can throw a cloud between him&#xD;
and his God. I have spoken to you hastily in the sharpness&#xD;
of my feelings. I am an erring man myself-I have suc-&#xD;
cumbed to many temptations1-temptations of thought&#xD;
rather than deed. I desire to have some charity for diversity&#xD;
of character and education in others. I desire to remember&#xD;
that all human beings tire looked upon with hopes of amend-&#xD;
ment by the 'company of heaven.' It would gratify me to&#xD;
kill Mr. Ashley. But I will judge him from his standpoint&#xD;
and not mine-I remember that his early training has been&#xD;
different, and that the seeds which have germinated such sor-&#xD;
row for your friends, have been dropt into his heart for&#xD;
many a year. lie has his passable points, no douiht, but&#xD;
from my standpoint he is-villanous !" he passed his hand&#xD;
across his forehead, and rising, paced the room.; there was&#xD;

"Marcus! tfri~ is not so! his children will honor him all&#xD;
the more when they understand his motives! neither am I&#xD;

"Nay, Agnes, hear me out. I am simply drawing a pic-&#xD;

among whom are men of business and men of fashion-few&#xD;
of these may be too good to sin discreetly, yet among theni-&#xD;

Agnes paled and reddened under the torture, but her eyes&#xD;

"Marcus! when his love was mine, would you have seen&#xD;

"He would have deserved honor had he resisted tempta-&#xD;

did not-I despise him: less perhaps than I should have&#xD;
done, had he sought to retain his position before men. In&#xD;
his infatuation, he has fallen with yOU in public Opinion : he&#xD;
has taken a stand from which he can never rise. I believe&#xD;
his passion at first cOntemplated only your downfall, but it&#xD;
has wrought his own. But to the picture. In another&#xD;
house, a tender natural heart laments as Rachel lamented,&#xD;
but far more bitterly-the ewe-lamb that she loved is gone&#xD;

fugitive went forth in her foreign home to do good: doubt-&#xD;

the heart that she had bruised: her ears were deaf to its&#xD;
pain. Beside this suffering woman sits a man who has no&#xD;
God to go to-almost he has been persuaded to be a Chris&#xD;
Pan by the virtues of his wife and adopted child, but now&#xD;
the doubts of a former' time rise with tempting vigor in his&#xD;

"Uncle Harrington stipulates for, this ?" faltered Agnes.&#xD;
"Aye! it is so, and the influence upon him is not unlike&#xD;
the effect of your conduct upon the many friends who have&#xD;
respected you. It is idle to tell you that you have given&#xD;
me the cruelest pain of my life, Agnes! this strange meet-&#xD;

his band upon hers, as he bent ovei' her : his low, thrilling&#xD;
cadence moved her, alas! deeply, but she responded'.&#xD;
"No, Marcus !"&#xD;
"Would to God that light from heaven codld reveal you&#xD;
to yourself, Agnes !" he uttered. As he was about to speak&#xD;
again, she said, "I have listened to you, my brother! no~v&#xD;

sweeps all you have said away, and reveals to me my duty~&#xD;
Mr. Ashley is my true, spiritual husband, and to cleave to&#xD;

"Your principles would become rottenif~ss, Agnes, should&#xD;

was this not so? Did your embrace the Free Love prin-&#xD;

She preserved ~ cold silence~ foi' she could not dent the&#xD;
truth of this: he proceeded "Agnes, when you first wil-&#xD;
lingly listened to seducing tones from. that man, the serpent&#xD;
went hissing through the garden of your soul-the aspect of&#xD;
all former truths was- changed: you were persuaded to eat&#xD;
from the-tree of death. Principles, to be of worth, must be&#xD;

of temptation is no time to seize upon new theories&#xD;
&#xD;
such hours we have enough to do, to cling to the landmarks&#xD;
that we trusted, when judgment and no~ feeling was om nipo-&#xD;
tent. I pity you from my soul, Agnes, for you ar~ in a&#xD;

love-but~yOu tax every faculty to justify it-you glory in&#xD;
your misfortune, and would say to others, 'Eat! ye shall&#xD;
be as gods, knowing good and evil! Ye shall not surely&#xD;
die!' The passion has struck into your marrow, my poor&#xD;
sister: if it ever be extracted, you will cry out, 'The ar-&#xD;

in~ sore!' Oh! come with me now! awake from your soph-&#xD;

She rose and cast herself upon his breast, weeping wildly.&#xD;
"I mind me of all our love, Marcus !" she sobbed, as soon&#xD;
as she could speak, "Because you love me, I would not&#xD;

Ashley is the high priest of my spirit. I am in truest&#xD;

self, and stood a little way from him, then as her limbs&#xD;
trembled, she sank on her chair.&#xD;

"What do you mean, Agnes ?" he questioned, resuming~&#xD;
his own seat.&#xD;
"You are living with one who can never understand or&#xD;
appreciate you. 1 judge from Sylvia's letters that she. is&#xD;
childish and 'superficial. God never mated you to her; she&#xD;
can nqver enter the sanctuary of your soul; she can never&#xD;
satisfy the cravings of your heart. I believe yet that you&#xD;
will cut the Thise tie that binds you to her !"&#xD;
"Qood Heavens, Agnes! would yo'u bring about the&#xD;
wickedness of the French revolution, by throwing disrepute&#xD;
on the marriage-coven afit? Would you let loose upon society&#xD;
the blackest dregs of the human soul? Would you have me&#xD;
break my sweet wife's heart? Would you have me go in&#xD;
search of some other woman to love? Would you have my&#xD;
tender Sylvia given over to any scoundrel who might pretend&#xD;
to love her? Would you have her left dying by the way side&#xD;
panting out her heart at desertion? Would you have&#xD;
child separated from one of her natural protectors ?"&#xD;
"You draw an extravagant picture, Marcus! Both you&#xD;
and Sylvia will fail in developing the highest elements with-&#xD;
in you, irntil you are each mated to your own !"&#xD;
"Thou shalt not commit adultery" is a mandate I can&#xD;
violate only at peril of my soul. We shall developed&#xD;
angeltically only as w~ give heed to the Bible. The fhncy&#xD;
often glorifies an actu~d being into the desired ideal; ~'our&#xD;
fanny has done this; ~the fancy of many another has done&#xD;
'the same; when the i fusion is dissolved, the rev~dsion of&#xD;
feeling is so great, that the most explicit commands of God&#xD;
&#xD;
are sometimes necessary to keep the tempted in the path of&#xD;
right. I agree with you, that 'the Divin.e Being whose&#xD;
wisdom and love are infinite, has created His creatures with&#xD;
wonderful capacitics~of attachment; but lie has hedged our'&#xD;

over, though it be with breaking heart, the pages which the&#xD;

She strove to speak, but only shook her head dissentingly.&#xD;
"Once," he continued, "you were ready to embark all&#xD;
the energies of your soul in doing gQod: you went into&#xD;
society with a deep purpose 1-you mingled with the world,&#xD;

head wqs drooped low: her pale hands were still and&#xD;
strengthless: ~he was insensible: he raised the head, and laid&#xD;
it upon his heart, he rubbed the cold hands, and looked to&#xD;
see the breath return. When consciousness was restoi'ed&#xD;
she was borne to her chamber, where she languished in ill-&#xD;

heart watched over her. When she xva~ able to read, Mr.&#xD;

"Perhaps he broke it, Diana !"&#xD;
"No!" was the decided response. "I'm going to see her&#xD;
this instant, though it rain a deluge, and I float there in an&#xD;
ark."&#xD;
"Yan can't go today, my dear. The carriage was broken&#xD;
yesterday !"&#xD;
"N'importe! where there's a will, tl~ere' s a way. I'll&#xD;

'to the door.&#xD;
"Sois tranquille, ma chere mere! it won't hurt me !"&#xD;
"If you will go, give my love to the girls !"&#xD;
In a very few minutes, Diana was equipped for her walk.&#xD;
or rather ride in the omnibus; for, after she started, she dis~&#xD;
covered one that bore her within a block of her destination.&#xD;
She found the house without difficulty, and being directed to&#xD;
the room occupied by her friends, she tapped at the dool',&#xD;
and was admitted by Amy, who exclaimed, "Diana Blake !"&#xD;
and then embraced and kissed her heartily, adding as she&#xD;
offered the chair from which she had risen, "Did you rain&#xD;
down ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I did that very thing. Where's Bel ?"&#xD;
"She's ironing muslins in the dining room below! she&#xD;
~i'ill be in presently."&#xD;
"iDid you ever see such weather? is'nt it scandalous? its&#xD;
enough to spoil one's disposition !" Diana tried to smil?,&#xD;
but the change in her school-mates' circumstances was so&#xD;
great, that she broke down, and fairly cried: Amy's patient&#xD;
face touched her deeply: the little chamber seemed like a&#xD;
prison. Amy more than half guessed the cause of Diana's&#xD;
tears: her courage rose exultant, yet so affecting is it to be&#xD;
ge~iuinely pitied and to contemplate ourselves through corn-&#xD;
&#xD;
passionate eyes, that she came near dropping a tear over&#xD;
herself as she asked, "What is the mattel', Diana ?"&#xD;
"The juiriping toothache, I guess; or something like iii !"&#xD;
responded the gay girl, brushing away her tears, and try-&#xD;
ing to keep them back.&#xD;
Amy laughed; one drop fell over her cheek as she did so,&#xD;
but the disposition to pity herself fled as if by magic.&#xD;
"Are you sorry for Bel and me ?" she asked.&#xD;
Diana nodded, not yet quite restored to herself.&#xD;
"Well, my dear, you know that imagination is powerful&#xD;
in making us happy or miserable." Amy philosophically&#xD;
replied: "To be sure, this room is slightly contracted, but&#xD;
then Bel and I have. been used to poverty, and that makes a&#xD;
great difference. Now if we gain a real good by living as&#xD;
we do, we are richer than if we lived handsomely. We are&#xD;
copying the character of Diogenes, and it has benefited us&#xD;
already. I confess, Diana, that I am not as candid by&#xD;
nature as I hope to become. I want to call things by their&#xD;
right names; I want, to cease to be ashamed of the lot that&#xD;
is, and has been mine. I am trying to be and not to seem;&#xD;
it is ' a daring effort, and I often fail, but to you I will be&#xD;
frank."&#xD;
"Then tell me if you found it easy to take your present&#xD;
position! eli me, if you 'stood in no dread of unfriendly&#xD;
gossip ?"&#xD;

"Did you ~ break your engagement on the impulse of the&#xD;

"I did it from impulse and reflection both !"&#xD;
"Why ?"&#xD;
"1 did not love Mr. Second as a wife ought to love a&#xD;
husband !"&#xD;
"Was he repugnant to you ?"&#xD;
"No! I had, and have a strong friendship for him !"&#xD;
"Have you seen him lately, Amy ?"&#xD;
"No, he does not know where we live. I have not spoken&#xD;
with him since we parte~."&#xD;
" I saw him at the ope ~a last evening with Mrs. C~Alins !"&#xD;
Diana hoped to ascei.tain\ the depth of Amy's friendship for&#xD;
her lover, else she would ~not have told this fact. A painful&#xD;
blush overswept Amy's face. Feeling that her friend's&#xD;
searching lonk was upon h6r~ she somewhat bitterly said,&#xD;
"The old proverb is true." Men have died, but not for&#xD;
love.&#xD;
Diana smiled at the adage, but responded with eager-&#xD;
ness: There was a vast difference in his manner to Mrs&#xD;
Collins, and that he formerly used to yow,: he loves you&#xD;
still, and I believe that you love him better than any one,&#xD;
Amy."&#xD;
"I understand myself! I am glad to be free !"&#xD;
"But let him know where you live! let hint see you&#xD;
I'll give a party and invite you both. You shan't have such&#xD;
a ~iard life as this !-~you an.d he would beth be happier to-&#xD;
gether. You have grown thin and pale, and you won't live&#xD;
&#xD;
long in this way. As his wife, think wh~t your position&#xD;
would be! we would go to watering places together, read&#xD;
together ride together shop and have such&#xD;
together,             high&#xD;
times! You could go to Europe with him! remember&#xD;
what a desire you have always had to travel! Now, Amy,&#xD;
I wouldn't say this, if you loved any one else better. You&#xD;
are as fond of pleasure as myself, and this life of drudgery&#xD;
is dreadful: it is slavery. You are burying your talents,&#xD;
and toiling like a servant, when you might be an ornament&#xD;
to society : think of the poor that you could minister to, if&#xD;
you had plenty of money. I like Mr. Second: I always&#xD;
did."&#xD;
"Diana! the deed is done, and if I were to live a&#xD;
thousand years, 1 would not recall it. I could not so de-&#xD;
mean myself as to act from motives that I condemn. I see&#xD;
now that I might never have 1)rOken the en~agemen tif a&#xD;

her views developed slumbering fears that had often~stirred&#xD;
my heart. I think 1 am a better woman for having acted as&#xD;
I did: I. may occasionally crouch in weaknesss under the&#xD;
present results of my work: to others I may seem to have*&#xD;
acted unwisely, but I believe that a wonderful Providence&#xD;
has led me on ray way, and that it even turned Mrs. Col-&#xD;

you act against your feelings. You are right, but "-Diana&#xD;
fell into thought, and twisted the fringe of her velvet man-&#xD;
tilla, at the risk of destroying its be.auty.&#xD;
"But what ?" demanded Amy, taking her hand from its&#xD;
employment.&#xD;
"I do say you have not used what we call practical, com-&#xD;
mon sens~ in your late proceedings !-2You and Bel can't&#xD;
get along by yourselves. I know more of the World than&#xD;
you do."&#xD;
"0, nonsense, Diana!"&#xD;
At this moment, Isabel entered carrYing in her arms a&#xD;
quantity of newly.ironed collars and laces." Why, Diana,&#xD;
I am so glad to see you !" she cried cordially. "Don't we&#xD;
live in a nutshell? wait until I put my i~uslins on the bed,&#xD;
and I'll kiss you!"&#xD;
Diana noticed how great was the cohtra~t in the appear-&#xD;
ance of the sisters. BA looked joyous and fresh an~ smiles&#xD;
came readily to her lips; hard thoughts evidently had not&#xD;
pressed upon her, nor did it seem to tax her heavily to beai~&#xD;
her lot. Amy might utter the strongest and most cheerful&#xD;
words, but they were coined from faith, rather then sen-&#xD;
~ation.&#xD;
"Did I write you of Bel's engagement ?" asked Amy-,&#xD;
pleased to see that Diana looked upon the by ely girl with&#xD;
satisfaction.&#xD;
"0 don't !" pleaded Bel, " or I shall go down stairs&#xD;
again !"&#xD;
"You told me, Amy, and Bel is happy, I. know! I am&#xD;
&#xD;
glad of this, Bel !" Diana clasped her hand cordially, bu~&#xD;
teasingly ~tdded, "Just think of the making, mending, and&#xD;
tl~dng, before you, Miss." Seeing that she did not design to&#xD;
tease hey very much, Isabel ~rniled her thanks for the con-&#xD;
gyatulation, atid sat down on the bed. " I wish I were more&#xD;
like you, Bel !" continued Diana, "1 wish one person could&#xD;
satisfy me. Diana is Diana, and always will be !"&#xD;
"Tell us about yourself !" said Rd, who loved to hear&#xD;
Diana talk.&#xD;
"Ask me to describe the origin of the pyramids of&#xD;
Egypt, and P11 tell you all about it, but as to myself I know&#xD;
nothing, except that I am one thing one day, and another,&#xD;
the next. Wait until I become a grandmother, and I'll tell&#xD;

Isabel laughed, and then shook her head; a sort of pity&#xD;
diffused itself over her countenance, after her smile died&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"You \vould not exchange your fate for mine, Isabel?'&#xD;
Again the fair girl shook her head with a grave smile,&#xD;
which was reflected upon the countenance of her questioner.&#xD;
"Aye! you ~perhaps are wise, for an idiot is happier than&#xD;

"That is a child's pantalet: our pi'ofession is to em-&#xD;

Diana rapped a light tattoo on the window sill with her&#xD;
gloved fingers, and then suddenly exclaimed, "There comes&#xD;
- old Sol himselft; breaking through the clouds. When I&#xD;
have the 'blues,' they disappear as briskly as those bleak&#xD;

"It is so desperately wet, Diana. Stay until after dinner&#xD;
and the pavements will be dry."&#xD;
"Impossible! I expect the most beautiful of my beaux&#xD;
to bring me a bbok, this morning, and I must see him, of&#xD;
course. Come !" she rose, a~nd stamped her pretty, arched&#xD;
foot imperiously.&#xD;
"Amy obeyed, and that her walk might not be altogether&#xD;
useless, she rolled up a little parcel of embroidery to take&#xD;
with her. The two started away together: it was pleasant&#xD;
to Amy again to walk at Diana's side, as she had so often&#xD;
done before.&#xD;
"Do hold up your dress a little when you co~ne to the&#xD;
lakelets !" she exclaimed as they circumnavigated a puddle&#xD;
of water.&#xD;
"What's the difference? returned Diana, looking down.&#xD;
As she spoke George Coleman passed them; he was not&#xD;
observed by her, although he bestowed uppw her such a&#xD;
glance. of interest as had formerly belonged to another ;t he&#xD;
&#xD;
did not even look to see who might be the companion of the&#xD;
lively belle. Simply noting the fact that she was not walk-&#xD;
ing alone. Did not the heart of the little sewing girl cry&#xD;
out against being forgotten? Did not his love seem more&#xD;
beautiful to her when she saw it reflected upon another?&#xD;
Aye! this was so; it seemed to her as if a sob sounded&#xD;
through every chamber of her spirit; she clung to Isabel as&#xD;
to the only one left to her upon earth.&#xD;
"Amy, darling, I seem to develop into a different being&#xD;
under your spiritual touches 1" said Diana affectionately.&#xD;
"I do not deceive you as I do the rest of tiw world. I wish&#xD;
you and Bel would spend the winter with me !-I believe I&#xD;
should grow quite good by spring: you see how changeful I&#xD;
am, you only can steady me in better purposes !"&#xD;
"Ah! there is your error, dear: you would lean on the&#xD;
human, rather than the Divine. I thank you from my heart&#xD;
for your invitation, but the impossible is written against it.&#xD;
The little chamber we have left, is less humbling to me,&#xD;
than would be one in your house, because I have alright to&#xD;
it. I shall be a self-supporting friend t9 those who love&#xD;
rue! Your invitation is more generous than ~ny acceptance&#xD;
would be."&#xD;
"Amy, I can't get through the winter unless I have com-&#xD;
pany. Sacrifice y~ir inclination for my benefit. I am&#xD;
purely selfish-I thought of this during all my ride to see&#xD;
You.&#xD;
Amy persisted in her refusal, and turned the conversation.&#xD;

"I think you said once that he interested you ?"&#xD;

"He's not in the unfathomable ocean yet, but he will be:&#xD;

should arouse perhaps he would be the awakened."&#xD;
"If he w&amp;amp;re, would you marry him, or would you repeat&#xD;
the old experience ?"&#xD;
"Je ne sais pas! I don't Want to marry, Amy. I like the&#xD;
life I lead in many respects. If I could retain my good&#xD;
looks I should live and die a maiJen;as Queen Elizabeth&#xD;
did. If Marcus had been more patient with me, I should&#xD;
have been his wife to-day perhaps, but I am changed: 1 am&#xD;

"One woman like you Diana can do far more harm than&#xD;

then to the humble sweetness of her voice. ".1 don't care&#xD;

"You would not like to have your rule work both ways.&#xD;

"I never said so! he had a boyish fancy for me once. I&#xD;

from George; present silence might then betray to Miss&#xD;

told this circumstance, thinking that; then clearing a cloud&#xD;

Amy told the story, giving it a light, careless cast, such&#xD;

the gentlemen F have b~en in the habit of meeting. We&#xD;
may brush by people in the street who are more suited to&#xD;
us, than many whom we love, but circumstance and Prov-&#xD;

not because it pleased me, but because it is best so&#xD;
"Faith! faith! you possess it, Amy! how happy it&#xD;
makes you! You think everything is right !"&#xD;
"Not just so, Diana! I think everything is right for us&#xD;
only 'vhile we are striving to walk by the light we have&#xD;
I think when we cleave to God we are shielded from every&#xD;
harm in reality: it is as though we were enclosed by a crys-&#xD;
tal wall, with missiles of war flying thick and fast about&#xD;
us. It is one thing to suffer, and another to receive harm:&#xD;
we can feel that we are growing rich while we suffer: I&#xD;
have felt this. I have suffem~d much, but life never seemed&#xD;
to me more sublime than at present : and yet," she added&#xD;
with a smile, "many may be exclaiming, 'Poor thinol'&#xD;
I may sometimes wince under my lot, but there is strength&#xD;
lying far back in my soul! I can walk the path, even if I&#xD;
sometimes hesitate, and* pray for a different one." While&#xD;
the young girl talked, she saw a light upon her pathway,.&#xD;
and she believed that always thus the Mer~iful Father&#xD;
would vouchsafe his consolations: she dreamed not, that at,&#xD;
the moment many human hearts were crying out "They will&#xD;

Diana went to her sumptuous home. Mindful of her&#xD;
promise to Amy, she attempted rn fascinations, and exer-&#xD;
cised no little bewitching arts, of which she could compute&#xD;
the exact value. Her impulsive nature seemed for the time&#xD;
permeated by the spirit of her friend. She actually sat by"&#xD;
the window demurely sewing, when George Coleman was&#xD;
ushered into her presence. True., she pricked her fingers&#xD;
frequently, owing to her rare use of the needle, and her&#xD;
velocity was not great enough to make her head swim, yet&#xD;
she felt a childlike pleasure in thinking that she was&#xD;
behaving well, ~.nd she ventured to violate custom ,sut~-&#xD;
ciently to take a stitch in her work now and then, during&#xD;
the call. She hastily shut every crevice in conversat~Ofl,&#xD;
which could open an arena to flirtation. This did not disap-&#xD;
point her guest on the coiltrary, it seemed to invest her&#xD;
with a peculiar and graceful womanliness: it is always&#xD;
pleasant to see a woman, whose intellectual gifts have been&#xD;
highly cultivated, busied in the sweet, small field of domes-&#xD;
tic industry. Diana talked of politics and of books, and&#xD;
upon these subjects she discoursed so readily and eloquent-&#xD;
ly, that George found his own fine intellect glowing health-&#xD;
fully from contact with hers. Yet, so small a thing will in-&#xD;
fluence in a serious matter, that, had not her dimpled hands&#xD;
held her sewing, he would have pronounced her too strong-&#xD;

Omnipotent reigneth :" he did not realize that a good&#xD;
woman finds her sweetest happiness in pleasing the company~&#xD;
ion of her choice, and her heaviest sacrifice in braving his&#xD;
censure. Both wilful husbands and wilful wives can be&#xD;
best tamed by magnanimity. Yet Was George a frank and&#xD;
noble ~'ellow, capable of~ being changed into the gentJestof&#xD;
men, by a woman-who united the guilelessness of the dove,&#xD;
with a subtle wisdom. We believe that our Lord has&#xD;
dowered woman with peculiar insight, that she might influ-&#xD;
ence the stronger sex wisely. A selfish woman does not&#xD;
use this insight as a divine light; men wonder at the artful-&#xD;
ness that gains her object, when they have endeavored to&#xD;
circumvent her.&#xD;
When George left Diana, he began to think of her as a&#xD;
wife.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
AMY had parted from Diana with smiling lips and affection~.&#xD;
ate feelings, but no sooner was she left to herself than she&#xD;
found it necessary to clasp closely, still more closely to her&#xD;
breast, the sweet and solemn faith that upheld her; it was to&#xD;
her, as if the firmament of her spirit were studded with stars&#xD;
of clearest justre; the stars were truths of God: she looked&#xD;
up to them, and they gave her assurance, but when she bent&#xD;
her eyes down upon her daily walk so sorrowful a pain&#xD;
caine to her that she was driven to lift her drooping head,&#xD;
and utter, "Thy Providence! Thy Providence is over me,&#xD;
oh God !'~&#xD;
She had thought herself brave, and self-sustaining: she&#xD;
had dared with haughty hand to put away from her the of-&#xD;
fering of affection, saying, "It is not sufficient for, me&#xD;
Now that the love seemed lost to her, a longing to sleep on&#xD;
a faithful heart for the moment seized her she recalled&#xD;
George's idolizing eyes, his cordial laugh, his merry repartee,&#xD;
his protecting care! her heart yearned for such dew and&#xD;
sunshine as had fallen upon her in her days of innocent ar-&#xD;
rogance: she recalled the fond, earnest look with which Mr.&#xD;

Second. had sometimes i'egarded her. Oh! were no~ that&#xD;
better than to be isolated as she was? it seemed to her that&#xD;
d~y that it would be easy, nay, blessed, to forget and forgive&#xD;
all dissirnilitudes of character, so that tender arms should&#xD;
enclasp her. and lips should sometimes say, "Thou art the&#xD;
world to me&#xD;
When she sat down in her I ttle chamber, and took out a&#xD;
new piece of muslin from he reticule to embr idei', after&#xD;
her walk, Isabel exclaimed: 'how mean our 'oom must&#xD;
have looked to Diana! What an original girl he is! she&#xD;
don't care for conventionalities at all !"&#xD;
"Yes, she does, and she care for high life. T ese things&#xD;
have a great value with her, but they are not o primary&#xD;
iniportance, as with many: she would not ~sacri ce friend-&#xD;
ship to them; with her, the individual has the k'st place,&#xD;
and his surroundings the second, yet a commonplace rich&#xD;
person would have for her a greater attraction than a coin-&#xD;
i~~onplace poor person, though each had precisely the same&#xD;
degree of education and refinement. There is a subtle aura&#xD;
about the heads of the wealthy, at sight of which, the real&#xD;
inan seems to undergo a change, and become more than I~e&#xD;
is.",&#xD;
"The rich man professes a kind of 'power out of himself&#xD;
that can. affect others !" said Bel. " He can write a few&#xD;
words, that will make another happy or miserable: he can&#xD;
make little hungry children laugh and shout for joy: he&#xD;
can clear from the brow of his debtor a cloud oFauxiety, or&#xD;
fasten upon his heart a devouring uneasiness: he can he of&#xD;
&#xD;
A~[Y DEN13ROO'~.&#xD;
&#xD;
service by his very look and smile, and hearty shake of the&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
"I've thought about all this a great de~il, Bel, and with&#xD;
such a scornful bitterness against human nature; there has&#xD;
seemed such injustice everywhere. Why should the honest,&#xD;
ragged laborer receive a cufi; a jeer, an impudent threat, ~f&#xD;
his soiled shoe leaves a mark upon a Wilton carpet as he&#xD;
toils in a fine house, when if the rich man's boot has made&#xD;
an ugly impress in the house of an acquaintanCe, and he re-&#xD;
grets it politely, the sweetest smiles await him?. Why&#xD;
should the dry goods' clerk bow obsequiouSly to the rich&#xD;
lady, and speak gri~ffly to the meek) pove~ty~stricken woman&#xD;
whom he next waits upon? I understand the difference that&#xD;
wealth and position make, far better than I used to do. I&#xD;
see that these give great actual advantages, but with this&#xD;
knowledge, a truer ~nderstandiflg of myself has come also.&#xD;
I did not know in old times that affection was s~ necessary&#xD;
to my happiness: now I know that I would choose it with&#xD;
the deepest poverty, and let all the glory of the world go by,&#xD;
if it could not give it to me. George is interested in Diana,&#xD;
Bel! Ii saw it in his look; we met him.&#xD;
"0, people are so different frorA what one would think !"&#xD;
said Bel. "He used to look and act as if you were the&#xD;
most delicious, bewitching little angel on the f~~tst~ol I I&#xD;
used to think he adored you~ just like Lord Mortimer adored&#xD;
Amanda, in 'The Children of the Abbey,' and I thought he&#xD;
always would.&#xD;
"so did II" returned Amy with a smile that was half&#xD;

pity for herself; half derision. "I thought so frequently, yet&#xD;
when I l~qkcd around, and observed how men and women&#xD;
conducted in real life, I believed he would soon recover from&#xD;
his attachment for me. It is two years since he used to&#xD;
cometo our dear little sanctum. Two years !" She looked&#xD;
dreamily out of the window, bu.t her hands were clasped.&#xD;
"I wouldn't care a straw for him, Amy. lie isn't worthy&#xD;
of you, if he can be so fickle !"&#xD;
"Doii't be irrational, Bel !" returned Amy, looking&#xD;
around with an attempt at a smile. "What right have I to&#xD;
expect constancy from him? I sent him away! I am not&#xD;
heart-broken; I wa~ a little taken ~&#xD;
ysulp~lse to see that he&#xD;
gave Diana the very looks that I had thought sacred to my..&#xD;
self. My heart is empty, that is all that ails me: I happen.&#xD;
ed to look back upon the dream that filled it. Perhaps&#xD;
George only taught me that I could love, and he left me&#xD;
pecting the magician !-but the magician does not Come, and&#xD;
I look back to him who~\threw open the doors ~f my heart."&#xD;
She was again looking out of the window as she spoke the&#xD;
last words.&#xD;
Isabel's silence; and a stealthy journey of her pocket..&#xD;
handkerchief to her eyes~, (the pantomime flitted sideways&#xD;
past Amy,) caused her to look around. Bel was trying to&#xD;
sew, while the fast dropping tears made her vision dim.&#xD;
"Now,. Be], you dear little Be], don't imagine that lam&#xD;
miserable! Ddn't you know that people's moods change&#xD;
with every sun'? my feelings are not very deep."&#xD;
"But, dearest I am so happy! I have such affection as&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
you would barter the glory of the world for. It gives me&#xD;
such a pahi in my heart, to know that you are lonely, and&#xD;
that your inner temple is not lighted up with such radiance&#xD;
as mine is !"&#xD;
"But it will be some bright day! I know that! I feel it.&#xD;
If I do not rejoice on earth, I shall in heaven, if I cheerfully&#xD;
make the best of everything. It always does me good to&#xD;
feel downright unhappy. for a little while: it seems as if some&#xD;
sweet spiritual sunshine is distilled from the tears that lie iii&#xD;
my heart; so just think that the Lord is preparing me for&#xD;
g~cat happiness when I am a little disturbed-it makes me&#xD;
go to Him so entreatingly. it is delightful to me to look&#xD;
upon your happiness and the doctor's; it smiles upon me,&#xD;
as if it ~vere a prophecy for myself. You and he are so&#xD;
frank with me, that I can enter into your feelings. I do&#xD;
sometimes feel like a 'little forlornity' when I hear your&#xD;
happy laughter, but be assumed, my darling, your engage-&#xD;
ment has embellished my own lot more than I can express.&#xD;
110w many anxious thoughts should I have had about you,&#xD;
if he had not been your anticipated protector! .I1ow~ could&#xD;
I see you prisoned here at work by rue, if I did not know&#xD;
that you had it talisman against suffering ?"&#xD;
The afternoon was wiled away in such conversation as&#xD;
cheered and elevated the hearts of the two girls. In the&#xD;
evening, Isabel went down into the pri~iate parlor to meet&#xD;
her lover. Amy was left alone ;she weptalittle as she&#xD;
thought of the past, and of the weak heart that God had&#xD;
given her, to struggle through the world with-a heart that&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC8253-00000163"/>&#xD;
326            ~MY DENI3Rooi~.                                             AJ~IY £~ENBROOl~.            327&#xD;
&#xD;
she had not known, and never should know perhaps, so&#xD;
chan~ ful was it mG its arrogance an d its humility. But angels&#xD;
caine down to talk with her as she wept, and they bade her&#xD;
look u&#xD;
p, and gaze With them out of God's beautiful Eden&#xD;
upon her clouded way. Lot everytJ~ing grew light and&#xD;
clear! the glorious ones took her willing hand, and pointed&#xD;
out to her a thousand causes for rejoicing. her sadness&#xD;
passed away, and it was no longer a night of stars with her;&#xD;
the morning broke, and.the sun of promise arose, flushing the&#xD;
heavens with delicate splendor, and revealing the earth&#xD;
lying beneath, filled with forms of wondrous power, whose&#xD;
tinting came fron-i the very home of God. She raised her&#xD;
head, and with a happy smile brushed away her tears, pene-&#xD;
trated to the soul with grati~ide that she existed, and held&#xD;
within herself the 'image of od' which ~ould reflect beauty&#xD;
upon all things: she turned to look upon her fellow-creatures&#xD;
with a tender joy, knowing that this image dwelt within&#xD;
each one; beautiful did it seem to her that good men were&#xD;
laboring everywhere, to remove the dust which had conceal-&#xD;
ed this shapelier self. What work could be so blessed, as&#xD;
that which would restore to the Father's hand his children,&#xD;
robbed of some of their spiritual deformities? iDid lie not&#xD;
knock at the door of every heart, and bid it receive his&#xD;
divine truth, that this labor might be performed?&#xD;
Amy arose, and taking from a trunk her diary, sat down&#xD;
to write upon the window sill; she carefully closed the&#xD;
blinds, lighted a small lamp, and then with a sense of happi-&#xD;
ness gave to the blank Volume, all, the beautiful thoughts&#xD;
&#xD;
that came to her. She flr~t noted in detail all the reasons&#xD;
why she should be grateful, and so wonderfully cheering did&#xD;
she make her situation appear, that she could not forbear&#xD;
writing, "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty God hath&#xD;
shined." Tier youth, her health, her education, her loving&#xD;
sister, her faithful friends, her love of the beautiful, her&#xD;
ability to make others happy; her power to work rather&#xD;
than 'to sit idle -all these seemed bT~sings of great&#xD;
m~.gnitudC. But above all this, she gave thanks for the faith&#xD;
that her parents had taught her: she SaW almost every-body&#xD;
looking upon the present world as the oply real world,&#xD;
while that beyond was fair only to christi ans; to the&#xD;
majority of' these, it was' shadowy and awful; to her, it was&#xD;
as real, and as joyously looked forward to, as a journey to&#xD;
Europe would have been by an enthusiast. She did not' for-&#xD;
get the solemn injunction, "By thy works thou shalt be&#xD;
iustifi~d, and by thy works thou shalt be condemned,"&#xD;
but even a around this trath. lingered an inspiring halo:&#xD;
there was something to work for, to suffer for, to hope&#xD;
for: she could stretch out her arms to receive all bliss&#xD;
and glory, if her soul were immortal, then it could&#xD;
never lose one hun~ian trait; it must be bent into some ac-&#xD;
cord with the Divine Soul, else heaven itself would be unin-&#xD;
viting to her :-but this accord! God has promised it to' alP&#xD;
who seek it!'&#xD;
11cr cheeks were glowing as she bent over her writing;&#xD;
the door of her room softly opened, and turning around, she&#xD;
saw 'Isabel standing there: the child looked encha'~ting~&#xD;

Huntington himself would have delighted to have painted&#xD;
Ler golden curls, her ey~s of blue, so tender in expression,&#xD;
her complexion which wa~ as delicate as a rose-tinted se~m&#xD;
shell, an~~i her sweet, ruobde mouth.&#xD;
"0, Del! I'm full of new' thoughts and plans !" cried&#xD;
Amy. "How delicious it is that I can do as I please! [am&#xD;
going to teach in a school! I khow that I can d'o far more&#xD;
practical good in such, a position, than if I were married.&#xD;
Think how many, many young spirits I can influence."&#xD;
"Yes!' but I think after all, that a wife and mother&#xD;
stands at the head of all philanthropy, if she fulfil her&#xD;
dutxr !" answered Isabel, coming forward, and laying her&#xD;
soft hand upon Amy's chestnut hair.&#xD;
"Yes, I give up! I only thought of the husband, and not&#xD;
the children !"&#xD;
"Ralph is full of new thoughts and plans to-night, Amy!&#xD;
He sent me for you,!"&#xD;
"I thought he had gone !" Amy gathered up her writing&#xD;
materials, and after putting them away, accompanied her&#xD;
sister to the back parlor below stairs, where she found Dr.&#xD;
Rendrick 'eagerly looking for their appearance.&#xD;
"Amy, if you are ~ot all ~nthiXsiasm~n at my plans, I shall&#xD;
never forgive you !" he exclaimed, smiling, as he took her&#xD;
hand, and led her to a seat on the sofa. Isabel sat down&#xD;
upon a little bench at her feet, and resting her arm upon&#xD;
her knees, looked up into the faces of the two.&#xD;
The doctor continued. "I have been collecting my bills&#xD;
lately, and, so niuch has my business increased, I think&#xD;
&#xD;
it will warrant me in taking this little child under my&#xD;
care !" hp laid his hand fondly upon the head of his be-&#xD;
trothed. "May I take her within a few weeks 3"&#xD;
It seemed to Amy that her darling was to be transplanted&#xD;
from her garden to his: she bent forward, and impulsively&#xD;
kissed her. "This may be as you wish !"~ she answered,&#xD;
looking from one to the other. "Bel is so young, if I did&#xD;
not have the utmost trust in you, doctor; I should never oc&#xD;
willing that she should leave her girlhood so soon 1"&#xD;
"Shall I be less tender of her than you, Amy 3" he ques-&#xD;
tioned. "Shall I ever place my own happiness before hers,&#xD;
think you 3 She is to me both child and angel-I shall pro-&#xD;
tect and reverence her. If you trust me, you do mc wrong&#xD;
to think I would lay upon her sunny head one burden that&#xD;
she would hesitate to bear. She is to me, the gift of God 1"&#xD;
he looked upon her with a thoughtful, tremulous smile.&#xD;
"Your destinies should be joined! I see it 1" responded&#xD;
Amy. "Some untoward fate might part you 1" she strove&#xD;
to smile, then rallying herself, she asked with her usual ani-&#xD;
mated manner, "And what are we going to do 3 how are&#xD;
we going to live 3"&#xD;
"That is what we have been talking about 1" eagerly ex-&#xD;
claimed Isabel. "We are going to board all together in&#xD;
some pleasant house up town. We have concluded to get&#xD;
pretty near the sky, because we can have larger rooms at the&#xD;
same price in the third. story. What do you think of it 3&#xD;
your room is to be next ours, 'ar~d we shall be like a prince&#xD;

you like the plan. He can't go with us, but then-----"&#xD;
Dr. Kendrick laughingly placed his hand over BeVs lips,&#xD;
saying, "Not so fast, little one! let Amy say whether we&#xD;
have been talking nonsense, before you go farther !"&#xD;
I&#xD;
Bel bit his hand with her pearly teeth, and then relapsed&#xD;
into silence, with a smile flitting about her mouth. Amy&#xD;
caught the glow of their innocent enthusiasm, and exclaim-&#xD;
ed. "0, 1 like the plan! But can it be executed? There&#xD;
are a good many et ceteras, doctor, that you may not have&#xD;
thought of! We might be stranded upon a financial crisis&#xD;
in the midst of our rejoicing ! Even if we board, ~ve should&#xD;
want various items to make our home comfortable, and this&#xD;
little lady may prove an expensive luxury even, to a prince&#xD;
like you 1"&#xD;
The doctor laughed,. and fell into thought. The three&#xD;
were habitually candid in regard to their circumstances.&#xD;
Bel started with, "Why, Amy, I--"&#xD;
Amy laid her fmn~er upon the child's parted lips, for she&#xD;
knew very well that she was going to say, "I could work&#xD;
as I do now !" It was not in accordance with Dr. Kendrick's&#xD;
wishes that his wife should labor for the bread which it was&#xD;
his place to earn. Amy knew if this were hinted at, that&#xD;
he would defer the' marriage, so strong wasimis pride, and so&#xD;
greatly did he pret~r that hi~ own right arm should support&#xD;
as well as shield his wife.. It should be after necessity, not&#xD;
forethought, that would compel a tn~n to consent to his wife's&#xD;
toiling out of her home-sphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Amy, tell me how much it will cost weekly, for Bel and&#xD;
m~e to live as we design? Count all the magnificent robes&#xD;
that this child must have V' Dr. Keudrick looked half&#xD;
regretfully upon his affianced: he would fain have cast at her&#xD;
feet, a wealth 'of pallid pearls, aud rubies red as blood.'&#xD;
Amy named a small but sufficient sum; her experience&#xD;
in this line of calculation h~1 been more ample than her&#xD;
wishes; necessity and skill h~i6l taught her the art of embel-&#xD;
lishing out of a little.&#xD;
"I can come up to that mark !" said the doctor. "liar-&#xD;
ra, Bel! we shall live in our enchanted palace yet."&#xD;
"Now listen to me, and don't suppose everything interest-&#xD;
ing centres in you !" said Amy, playfully, taking Isabel's&#xD;
hand, and tapping the doctor's. " I intend to teach in a&#xD;
large, flourishing ~ in this city, where I shall have an&#xD;
opportunity of handing down my airs and graces to the&#xD;
rising generation. I shall leave my new apartment near&#xD;
the sky, at half-past eight every morning, and shall return&#xD;
at four in the afternoon, when Mrs. Kendrick will so be en-&#xD;
raptured to see me, that she will forget her husband ever ex-&#xD;
isted 1"&#xD;
"Exactly! that is very interesting so far, to me !" re-&#xD;
sponded the doctor, gaily. "When did you learn about this&#xD;

" This evening! I have concluded to discover just such&#xD;

" Let us talk more ~&#xD;
"You can tell me all you say! particularly all the noli-&#xD;
sense !" replied Amy, releasing herself~ and extending her&#xD;
hand to Dr. Kendrick with a cordial "Good night !"&#xD;
She had no sooner gone thati the young physician took his&#xD;
~1 eparture; the gradual increase of his business had not in-&#xD;
duced him to give up copying. One hour at least was de-&#xD;
voted to it every day; though the hour was midnight, unless&#xD;
extraordinary occupation or fatigue prevented. This little&#xD;
source of revenue was the only constant one that he could&#xD;
rely upon : if he were weary at his task, the thought of&#xD;
Isabel inspired him. There was method in all that he did;&#xD;
though his time was broken in upon, as a physician's must&#xD;
be, he would not allow a week to pass without having ful-&#xD;
filled his prescribed task of medical reading; thus even&#xD;
Isabel found sometimes an hour, or a half hour taken from&#xD;
his visits to her. She and Amy marvelled at his syste-&#xD;
matic firmness, and often tried to imitate him; they would&#xD;
be beautifully rigid in the disposal of their time for ~ week&#xD;
or two, theti one would relapse, and the other would delight-&#xD;
edly follow the pernicious example. Yet in many things&#xD;
they were steadfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
TuE next morning the two girls started in search of a new&#xD;
home, and a school for Amy: she had seen two advertise-&#xD;
ments in the paper of the day before. After they had ar-&#xD;
rayed themselves neatly, they went forth talking earnestly.&#xD;
"You look so young !" said Isabel, remarking her sister'&amp;amp;&#xD;
fhce attentively when they were a ~block from their boarding-&#xD;
house. "That is such an objection in a teacher 1"&#xD;
"I fear it will be in my case U' returned Amy, stopping&#xD;
in her walk. "I'll put on a solid expression I rfhere I don't&#xD;
I look as if I could awe ~i regiment of young people !"&#xD;
"No !" laughed Isabel, "you won't do. that way I"&#xD;
"Well, I thought last night of getting out mother's gold&#xD;
spectacles. You always said I looked about forty in them&#xD;
when I didn't laugh! Let us go back I"&#xD;
"flow ridiculous I" cried Isabel, taking a step forward.&#xD;
Amy went laughing back, and Bel joined her. In a few&#xD;
minutes, the spectacles were adjusted to their place, and&#xD;
gave to the beautiful young countenance a different expres-&#xD;
'sion, by concealing Amy's bright eyes. She did not wear&#xD;
them to walk in, but when they reached the house to which&#xD;
the advertisement had directed them, she put them on, and&#xD;

&#xD;
rang the bell; her companion shrank partially behind her,&#xD;
for she was laughing, and if she bad not been, she was timid&#xD;
in regard 'to the new enterprise. In due time, a gaudily&#xD;
dressed lady opened the loor, and asked with a scowl and&#xD;
an overwhelming aspect, what was wanted.&#xD;
"I came to see about ~the situation as teacher that was ad~&#xD;
vertised!" returned Am ~r, with dignity.&#xD;
"We want a gentle n~ an !" retorted the overwhelming&#xD;
Woman, closing the dooP without ceremony in the girl's&#xD;
faces.&#xD;
"Did you ever ?" exclaimed Amy, looking at Isabel with&#xD;
unaffected seriousness. "Why didn't she stay long enough&#xD;
for me to ask her if the pupil's 'manners were to be formed&#xD;
after her style? I am astonished, yerily ! Well! let U's go&#xD;
to the iiext place !" she took off her glasses, and put theTh&#xD;
in her reticule with a spiteful dab, then seeing that Jsal el&#xD;
was nearly convulsed with laughter, she was struck with&#xD;
the ludicrous side of the afThir, and laughed with her whole&#xD;
heart: in fact, every step of their way to the next place&#xD;
4as devoted to' such exquisite nonsense and jesting as&#xD;
young people give way to, when they are in the vein.&#xD;
When they reached their second destination in the crowd-&#xD;
ed part of the city, they found that they must mount a dark&#xD;
flight of stairs, and search in the upper hall among a dozen&#xD;
small signs, for the hame they desired; their hearts fluttered&#xD;
uneasily, as they penetrated into this business den, where&#xD;
gentlemen were passing to and fro. At length they dis..&#xD;
covered the lawyers office that they sought; several gentle~&#xD;
&#xD;
men were gathered around a table, but they Were all unob-&#xD;
served, though they looked up at the entrance of the new&#xD;
corners: one came forward, and bowing pohtely, asked if&#xD;
they came upon' ~ch~~l business. Amy inclikled her head&#xD;
with a blush of embarrassment, for she felt out of place.&#xD;
Seeing, this, the lawyer led the way to a recess, and entered&#xD;
upon the matter in hand so easily and urbanely, that her&#xD;
usual self~posSC5Sion returned, He stated the salary that&#xD;
she would receive, after having questioned her upon her ac&#xD;
quirements, and said he had 'no doubt that she would obtain&#xD;
the situation, if the prificipal of the school were as favor&#xD;
bly impressed as he had been. lie penned a brief note to&#xD;
him, and handed it to Amy with his address upon the&#xD;
envelope. While h~ was writing, she cast a look at the&#xD;
table tosee what lawyers did in their offices: all the heads&#xD;
;vere bent over papers but one; that was partially turned&#xD;
aside, and the face was concealed by a supporting hand; as&#xD;
if her look had a magnetism in it, the hand was taken away&#xD;
and Mr. Second looked ~full at her an instant, and then re-&#xD;
suited the perusal of the paper he held, without the&#xD;
slightest token 'of recognition. It was the first time they&#xD;
had met since their parting. her cheeks, which had been,&#xD;
flushed with excitement, grew quite pale, 'and then her color&#xD;
returned. Isabel, who s~t next the window, had hardly once&#xD;
taken her eyes from the street, and was therefore unaware&#xD;
of Mr. Seconds presence. Amy believed that her former&#xD;
lover triumphed in her present circumStances; her heart&#xD;
was filled with sudden pride and anger, and she took her&#xD;

leave of the polite lawyer, as if she had been ,a queen, who&#xD;
could confer great thin's, but should never find herself re-.&#xD;
ceivino' them.&#xD;
"I think it is perf'~ctly insulting to require la dies to call&#xD;
at a place where there are so many gpntlernen !" she cx-&#xD;
claimed, as soon as they had~emerged int~ the street.&#xD;
"It is too bad !" responded Isabel, "~ ut how fortunate&#xD;
that you have the prospect of getting tl~ e situation. Two&#xD;
hundred dollars is not much, but how much more pleasant a&#xD;
way to earn it, than to s~w for it."&#xD;
"Mr. Second was there, Bel !"&#xD;
" Where'? at the table'?"&#xD;
"Yes! and he never even bowed, lie must be dreadful-&#xD;
ly angry with me; he must think very hardly of me. I&#xD;
don't care. I shall not trouble myself with pitying him, if&#xD;
.he is enraged, rather than grieved !"&#xD;
"You are unfair now, Amy. I should think he would be&#xD;
angry: you have said so yourself. I suppJse he didn't&#xD;
speak, because he didn't wish to attract attention to us. He&#xD;
was always jealous about having gentlemen rn3tice you;, he&#xD;
wa~ always taking you oUt of their way !"&#xD;
"Have we taken the right direction'?" Amy looked at&#xD;
her note, and said, "yes !"&#xD;
Here Mr. Second, who had left the office a moment after&#xD;
their departure, overtook them. He lifted his hat, with a&#xD;
courteous "good morning," but did not offer his hand.&#xD;
"You have been well, I suppose'?" he questioned.&#xD;
They answered in the affirmative. There was an indefina-&#xD;

ble something which assured Amy that her power over him&#xD;
xvus not gone: his cold looks were heavy upon her heart;&#xD;
she desired to remove them. He had not addressed her,&#xD;
though he walked beside her, as ~he was nearest th~ curb-&#xD;
stone. She lifted her face and looked in his! she saw his&#xD;
stern e~pressiOU relax almost instantly. "You haven't&#xD;
shaken hands with me !" she said with a faint smile.&#xD;
"You don't deserve it !" he returned with a smile still&#xD;
more faint thaa her own, yet he put forth hi~ hand and took&#xD;
within his own the little one, which had been all the world&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
"Can you remember our friendship if I do not deserve it'?"&#xD;
she asked with a shake in her low voice: she set her lips&#xD;
though her chin trembled.&#xD;
"Yes I" he replied aftei~ an instant's pause: the forgive-&#xD;
ness was not full and free. Who could expect that it should.&#xD;
be, with a man like him'? What had he not offered her'?&#xD;
all that seemed of most worth to himn-.all ! and how terri-&#xD;
bly she had injured him. Yet when he saw her friendless&#xD;
and seeking to win her bread, it took away much of his&#xD;
bitterness: it gave him a little triumph.&#xD;
"You are~ braving the world to-day," he said, addressing&#xD;
both, "how do you like it'?"&#xD;
Bel did not reply, feeling that he was watching for Amy's&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
"Very well !" answered that maiden, brushing a little&#xD;
dust from her reticule, and perceiving the latent triumph.&#xD;
"We shall succeed as we have done heretofore."&#xD;

"Experieiice has made you wise and strong probably !"&#xD;
he returned, then said to Isabel:&#xD;
"Is she as wicked as ever ?"&#xD;
"I don't know indeed! she is wise and wicked by turns."&#xD;
Isabel looked down as she spoke, remarking on Mr. Scored's&#xD;
part a disposition to sting Amy, mingled with an attraction&#xD;
toward her: the elder sister did indeed look peculiarly love..&#xD;
ly, as changeflul emotions overswept her face; she strove to&#xD;
render her mobile mouth firm, to drive back the lustrous&#xD;
tears that did i~ ot overflow, to keep smooth the sweet brow&#xD;
that knit with ~n instant's pain: the morning air had given&#xD;
her cheeks a rosy tint. She did not resent her former lover's&#xD;
probing words: she was glad that he had come to speak&#xD;
with them: she wished ~that she might sun herself in the old&#xD;
kind looks-that she might make herself charming to him,,&#xD;
might provoke his hearty laugh, his eager, happy glance.&#xD;
But the matter might not have ended t}iere: she was&#xD;
heartily gratified at the amount of friendliness bestowed&#xD;
upon her: she had expected more angei\ She involuntarily&#xD;
turned upon him a soft, thankful look, when they paused at&#xD;
a corner to take an omnibus. Mr. Second touched her arm&#xD;
to remove her from contact with the passers~bv: she went&#xD;
the other side of Bel, and he saw that the slight familiarity&#xD;
wa~ not to be repeated. After handing them into a stage,&#xD;
he walked away muttering, "I was a fool to start after them,&#xD;
when they left Stebbins' office! i'll visit the widow ~Collins&#xD;
this evening! she'll make me forget the foolish girl."&#xD;
Amy and Isabel alighted from the stage when the&#xD;
&#xD;
reached the street which they desired, and this was in the&#xD;
upper part of the city. Without any difficulty they found&#xD;
a large doublehollsewith the words ~" Young Ladies' Scm&#xD;
mary," over the door, cut in brown sth ne. Upon the silver&#xD;
door-plate, was engraved, "Mr. and Mrs. Alonzo Hawks."&#xD;
"Don't you dread to go in ~" asked Isabel. "Suppose,&#xD;
they should not accept you ~"&#xD;
"There are other schools in the world beside this 1" re-&#xD;
plied Amy, affecting more composure than she really ex-&#xD;
perienced. They rang the bell, and inquired for Mrs. Alon.&#xD;
zo Hawks: Mr. Hawks they held in greatest awe, and had&#xD;
no desire to see. A servant ushered them up stairs into a&#xD;
large parlor: in the adjoining room, some new beginner&#xD;
was running over the scales, upon a piano whose tone was&#xD;
not perfectly exquisite. A small lady apparently in a con-&#xD;
sumption, entered the parlor, and greeted them gently and&#xD;
smilingly. Amy gave her, her letter of introdiw4Aon.&#xD;
After a little conversation, Mrs. Hawks went down stairs&#xD;
after her husband. She returned with a gigantic man&#xD;
~vhose black eyes, bushy hair, resolute mouth, and heavy&#xD;
bass voipe alarmed the applicants. He merely nodded, and&#xD;
then bade Amy perform a difficult problem in Algebra: he&#xD;
handed her a slate and pencil. She tried her best, but so&#xD;
bewildered was she, that she could xiot succeed at all.&#xD;
"The young lady is a little embarrassed dear !" said Mrs.&#xD;
Hawks. "I remember that I once failed at an examination,&#xD;
when a young girl, who was far more ignorant than. I, got&#xD;
the certificate that should have been mine.~~&#xD;

Amy smiled gratefully, and said, "If I x~ere alone, that&#xD;
would not trouble me !"&#xD;
"We want a teacher who always has her mind at her&#xD;
4&#xD;
command !" answered Mr. Hawks in his terrifying bass.&#xD;
Amy colored with distress, but determined to triumph&#xD;
*       over her bashfulness, if possible. "Perhaps you inspire me&#xD;
with more awe than many persons would, sir !" she answer-&#xD;
ed with a half ironical, half timid smile.&#xD;
lie looked at her quickly, smiled, and said, "Try this!&#xD;
Parse this sentence !" she found no trouble in' mastering the&#xD;
grammar, nor in any other studies in which he was pleased&#xD;
to examine her. He had an inscrutable face, yet Amy be-&#xD;
lieved that he was pretty well ~atisfled. "Thkt Algebra !'&#xD;
hQ said, shaking his head, that is the only trouble !"&#xD;
"I'll try again !" she said, taking the slate and pencil to a&#xD;
window. Mrs. Hawks talked to Isabel; in a short time&#xD;
Amy, returned to the preceptor, and gave him the elate.&#xD;
He nodded approvingly. "Do you suppos~c you can keep&#xD;
young ladies in order, some of whom are taller than your-&#xD;
self? Is there any snap about you? This is a very&#xD;
necessary quality, Miss Denbrook!"&#xD;
"I can't tell how I shall succeed, sir !" she answered, not&#xD;
well pleased at the style of his address. " I think I can ac-&#xD;
complish the part I have oflhred lo undertake !"&#xD;
"Well, it's a bargain 1" he exclaimed, striking the gram-&#xD;
mar which he held upon a table, "if you are satisfied with&#xD;
our terms. We shall expect punctt~ality.-punctuality to&#xD;

She obeyed, a little chafed at his arbitrary manner. "Can&#xD;

My wife is not really able to teach another day."&#xD;
"I can come, sir 1"&#xD;
Come down in the school room&#xD;
They left the parlor. Isabel remained in the hall, but&#xD;
Amy went through the trying ordeal of an introduction to&#xD;
the assembled scholars. There was a buzzing to be heard&#xD;
before they entered the room, bu~ as Mr. hawks struck his&#xD;
grammar upo:~ a desk, and looked around, one could have&#xD;
heard a pin drop. Amy 9nly inclined her head, as x~ith much&#xD;
formality she was presented to the young ladies: every eye&#xD;
was fixed upon her. After this was over, she was introduced&#xD;
to several teachers. Then she was permitted to escape, and&#xD;
join Isabel.&#xD;
"I am perfectly quenched !" she exclaimed, "leb us hurry&#xD;
out of the houseor Mr. hawks will seize me, and make~&#xD;
me go through something else I" They emerged upon the&#xD;
street.&#xD;
"1 feel sorry for you, Amy, for I should be frightened to&#xD;

&#xD;
"I am very, Very grateful f~r my good fortune, Bel! I&#xD;
shall get along !"&#xD;
The young girls now proceeded in search of a new home.&#xD;
They. had several directions written down, which they had&#xD;
copied from the newspapers. After a very tiresome and cx&#xD;
haunting day, they finally suited themselves. Perhaps they&#xD;
Were not exactly suited, yet they determined upon resignation.&#xD;
Their rooms were in the fourth story, of a five stoi'y house; a&#xD;
large front chamber with a grate in it was for Del :-thi~ shc&#xD;
said should be called the "family room." here Amy&#xD;
should come in from school on wintry days, and should find&#xD;
their mother's little rocking chair next the fire' for her.&#xD;
Amy's apartment was a long, narrow room over, the hall; it&#xD;
joined the "fam~1y room," and what she prized most of all,&#xD;
it was moderately heated by a large pipe that ran through&#xD;
the floor from the hall-stove below: she should thus be able&#xD;
to hie to a retreat of her Own, and read, write, and study,&#xD;
when the happy wedded pair would naturally desire to be&#xD;
by themselves.&#xD;
*         *        *        *         *&#xD;
A few weeks after this, a small group was gathered in the&#xD;
parlor of a clergyman: a soft light fell upon a golden.liairtj~d&#xD;
girl who stood beside her lover: they pronounced holy VOWS.&#xD;
After the ceremony was over, the wife looked in her&#xD;
husband's Countenance an instant, as if to see that her&#xD;
innocent soul was n~iri~ored in his, and then she turned&#xD;
timidly away. As' Amy saw the brief look of each, a&#xD;
&#xD;
strange yearning broke up from the deep heart within her&#xD;
shu knew that ~he had flever so loved.&#xD;
Kid the next day began the new life in the five story&#xD;
house, for which all preparations had been previously made.&#xD;
Often when Amy returned from school, she found Isabel sit-&#xD;
ting at a table, carefully imitating the bold, even chirography&#xD;
of her husband: she often visited him at his office; upon&#xD;
one of these visits, she stole the papers which he intended&#xD;
to copy, and taking them hoffie, did this work for him.&#xD;
she looked so delighted a&#xD;
Upon his return,                      , nd laughed so&#xD;
charmingly at his surprise, when she showed him what she&#xD;
had done, that he found this occupation must be handed&#xD;
over to her, in order to keep peace in the family.&#xD;
Diana's residence was directly in Amy's way, as she went&#xD;
to school: she thus frequently stopt in to make a call, when&#xD;
she would not have had the time, had a long distance been&#xD;
before her. One afternoon she ~topt to spend two or three&#xD;
h(urs. When the servant admitted her, she said, "I will&#xD;
go up to Miss Blake's room&#xD;
She did so, but no one replied to her familiar tap; she&#xD;
therefore descended to the parlors, and finding them un-&#xD;
occupied, she sat down by a window; untying her bonnet&#xD;
strings and taking off her gloves she bestowed her attention&#xD;
upon a book which she had with her. It was a clear, glorious&#xD;
day in early winter: she had not waited long, when her at-&#xD;
tention was attracted by a lady and gentleman a clieval, they&#xD;
cantered up to the sidewalk where a servant stood waiting&#xD;
to receive the lady's reins. had Amy seen the pair any-&#xD;
where else, she would have recognized Diana at once from&#xD;

&#xD;
her peculiarly graceful carriage, and the careless abandon&#xD;
with which she threw the reins from her hand. She wore&#xD;
a black velvet riding habit, and a plume in her velvet hat&#xD;
her hair hung h~ brown ringlets, which waved in profusion&#xD;
against her dark robe. There was in her whole figure and&#xD;
air a superb and regal joyousness. The countenance of her&#xD;
companion, which was that of George Coleman, did not lack&#xD;
in animation : they made indeed a splendid picture, as their&#xD;
brilliant eyes and white teeth shone in laughter, contrasting&#xD;
with the rich blood that glowed upvn their cheeks. Mr.&#xD;
Coleman dismounted and made a slight pretence of bending&#xD;
his knee before Diana, then with a laugh and shake of his&#xD;
head, he received her, standing at his full height, an ci placed&#xD;
her upon the ground : she gathered up her habit, displaying&#xD;
a richly embroidered skirt, and her daintily arched fbot, that&#xD;
looked as if made to tread upon willing slaves. Amy&#xD;
caught his admiring e~pres~ion as it fell uponi the fair equcs.&#xD;
trien1~e; he was leading h~r to the stone steps of the~ house;&#xD;
ere they mounted them, Amy sprang to the piano and&#xD;
hastily seating herself began to' play a lively waltz: she felt&#xD;
conscious that she should appear more unembarassed if she&#xD;
were employed: she wished she were in Ethiopia-in the&#xD;
Great Desert of Sahara, or in any place where she should&#xD;
not be obliged to meet her quondam lover. There is a&#xD;
melancholy charm, "pleasant yet mournful to the soul," in&#xD;
meeting an old lover, if he seem a little dejected; but it is&#xD;
provoking to encounter him in a happy frame of mind, look-&#xD;
ing into another lady's eyes with the identical expression&#xD;
that convinced you he would go into a decline, if you re-&#xD;
&#xD;
fused him. Fortunately, Amy was spared this trial, for&#xD;
Diana entered the parlor alone, having parted with her com-&#xD;
panion at the door.&#xD;
"Why, Amy, this is you at the piano, is it ?" she cried,&#xD;
kissing her heartily, and taking off her hat at the same in-&#xD;
stant. "Come to my room while I take off my habit!&#xD;
Come, you blessed little child! I am so happy, happy at&#xD;
last !" she threw her arms around her, and kissed her again.&#xD;
"You'll be surprised at what I have to tell you ~"' She led&#xD;
h~r friend from the room, with her arm around her.&#xD;
When they had entered her chamber, she threw off her&#xD;
habit with impetuous has~e, and donned an elegant dressing&#xD;
gown: without waiting to fasten it with her brooch, she&#xD;
swept back her curls, and cast herself at Amy's feet, who was&#xD;
sitting upon an ottoman: she buried her face a moment in&#xD;
her fair arms, for her flowing sleeves fell back and revealed&#xD;
them, and then lifted her radiant countenance with the ex-&#xD;
clamation, "I am a queer girl, am I not ?"&#xD;
"Yes, rather; and yet you are not queer to me! You've&#xD;
been riding, I see by your habit !"&#xD;
"With whom?"&#xD;
Amy guessed three or four of her admirers, placing Mr.&#xD;
Coleman~s name in the middle; she spoke with a careless&#xD;
accent.&#xD;
"Not so fast," exclaimed Diana, "Mr. Coleman is the&#xD;
one. He is in the unftithomable ocean-he loves me, Amy!&#xD;
be un~lerstands me, and-look !" she held out her dimpled&#xD;
fingers, and upon one gleamed a new ring.&#xD;

"And you are happy, you say !" murmured Amy, bend..&#xD;

"Yes! Yes! I love bun better than my soul ! better&#xD;
than I ever loved Marcus. I thought I could never love&#xD;
again, and I could follow him to the ends of the earth with&#xD;
a mad devotion. My other affection was a mere- "&#xD;
"Nay, stop th6re!" said 'Amy, laying her finger upon&#xD;
Diana's lip, with a half incredulous smile. "It has been&#xD;
my happy fortune to be the repository of some heart;&#xD;
histories !-some women who are twice my age, have un&#xD;
locked their experiences t'o me; I have learned that when a&#xD;
person loves the second time, he or she invariably pronoun-&#xD;
ces the first love a mere-a mere something; as you were&#xD;
going to designate you&amp;amp;"&#xD;
"Now, Amy, you have no idea-"&#xD;
"Now Diana," interrupted Amy, who wished to drive&#xD;
away the narration of George's ~ew love," don't you re-&#xD;
member that you accused gentlemen of telling you un-&#xD;
truths, when they declared that they had 'never been in~&#xD;
fluenced by any woman save you? and here you are acting&#xD;
in precisely the same way. Haven't I seen you turn pale&#xD;
and red, when Mr. Leonard came upon you suddenly.?&#xD;
And didn't you say one day that your heart throbbed as if&#xD;
it would burst through your side, when he passed your&#xD;
window 'I"&#xD;
"0, Pshaw !" I wish your memory were as short as&#xD;
mine! I was young !"&#xD;
"It is a stiipendous mystery to me how you have re-&#xD;

covered from being young so soon! It seems to me if I had&#xD;
ever been in such a case as you&#xD;
"Stop!" cried Diana. "it's all nonsense about first&#xD;
love's being everlasting, and I won't be called to account&#xD;
for getting over it. Listen to this story !" she related in&#xD;
her graphic, heart-thrilling style all the tides of feeling that&#xD;
had swept over her of late-afld~ she told of George's love&#xD;
-of its eager a iid yet proud manner of expression. She&#xD;
closed with saying, "I am going to be so good and con-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
AND the deserted wife! how fared she while others were&#xD;
moving on in the world? S.ome tranquilly, some wearily,&#xD;
some blissfully, some patiently, and some staggering~y, un-&#xD;
der the tremendous magnitude of aroused passions ! A few&#xD;
days after the enlope~ment of Agnes, Mrs. Ilarrington&#xD;
sought the house of Mrs. Ashley; she suffered so acutely&#xD;
herself; that she could think of no relief; save that of trying&#xD;
to sympathize with one more wretched. She was refijsed&#xD;
admittance at first, but she insisted up0n being sh owr~ to&#xD;
the chamber Occupied- by Mrs. Ashley~ When the door&#xD;
was opened, the unhappy woman glared upon her ~almost&#xD;
fiercely, saluting her with, "It is my desire to be left alone!&#xD;
Why must you come to look upon my misery ?"&#xD;
"I have known what misery is! my heart turned to you&#xD;
so strongly that I could not resist its impulse !" Mrs, lIar-&#xD;
rington answered.&#xD;
"Take a chair !" said Mrs. Ashley~a little softened; after&#xD;
a moment she uttered, "0, God! it seems as if I shall go&#xD;
mad! mad! but I will not-he would rejoice ~at it !"&#xD;
"It is so sorrowful I am terrified to believe it," returned&#xD;
&#xD;
her companion, for the first time looking steadfastly at her:&#xD;
her black hair was thickly bestrexvn with white, her haughty&#xD;
mouth was drooped, and many lines seemed to have gather-&#xD;
ed about it-her pale, hollowed cheek loQked as if ages of&#xD;
suffering had passed over her.&#xD;
"Do you see this ?" pointing to her hair. "Do you&#xD;
believe that God will forget to smite that girl with a curse?&#xD;
'With what iricasure ye mete, it shall be measured to you&#xD;
again!'"&#xD;
Mrs. Ilarrington shuddered, but made no answer. Mrs.&#xD;
Ashley went on, "For years I have had dreadful days&#xD;
sprinkled through my life-I knew that Mr. Ashley was not&#xD;
faithful to me years ago, and I have hated him insatiably&#xD;
since then. I smiled, and smiled on; there wasapit in my&#xD;
heart; it seemed covered over with flowers, when I looked&#xD;
into the pit I groaned. Lately I have foreseen all this! I&#xD;
have been frenzied at my impotence. Do you believe that&#xD;
God will forget to visit them for the scorching fires they&#xD;
have lighted in my brain and heart? Will lie forget that&#xD;
they have ushered me into a living hell ?"&#xD;
"It was a guilty deed !" Mrs. llarrington tremblingly&#xD;
said, feeling new horror at it, as she saw its effects upon the&#xD;
miserable wife.&#xD;
"I have read His anathema~ against the unmerciful! I&#xD;
feast upon them !"&#xD;
"0, remember the words which you just now quoted'&#xD;
'With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you&#xD;

"I would be willing to be roasted in Ilades,, for the sake&#xD;

insanity. I&#xD;
"You did not love Mr. Ashley! it would have been more&#xD;

"No! but you are a wife, Mrs. ilarrington, and can&#xD;
understand a wife's pride, and agoi~y and humiliation, ~at see~&#xD;
ing herself scorned and deserted !"&#xD;
"No man can give a more mortal stroke."&#xD;
"I hear that she thinks Mr. Ashley pure 1" the excited&#xD;
woman laughed wildly. "I am as much, surprised at that&#xD;
old fool as at her; he has always been a slave to gentility&#xD;
and conventionalisi~s. She must have bewitched him&#xD;
strangely to make l~iin willing to be the laughing stock of&#xD;
his acquaintances.&#xD;
"They have sadly erred, but I fear we shall err if we do&#xD;
not cherish a right spirit toward them. They are in the&#xD;
hands of God."&#xD;
"It is vain to talk to me in this style; Agnes once prated&#xD;
piously to me-I hate the very sound that reminds me of&#xD;
the hypocrite."&#xD;
"She was a true and fervent christian once," replied Mrs.&#xD;
llarrington. "Religion is the same in itself; though the&#xD;
lives of its professors may fall short of its demands; If&#xD;
you would only turn to~ it now, Mrs. Ashley, it would&#xD;
afford you the only solace you can experience."&#xD;
Mrs. Ashley suddenly gave way to a flood of tears; she&#xD;

ChAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
SEVERAL months had passed ~ince Mr. Leonard's unsuccessful&#xD;
visit to his sister; months i 4 which he had heard nothing&#xD;
from her. The husband and wife sat together. Sylvia was&#xD;
recovering from ~ long and dangerous attack of fever: the&#xD;
daylight was ~t last admitted to her room-once more her&#xD;
fair head lay back against he~favorite easy chair-.-her little&#xD;
girl was now permitted to toddle about the room: the face&#xD;
of the invalid was yet pale and thin; her rich hair loosely&#xD;
floated about her, for she could not bear its weight when&#xD;
fastened with a comb; neither friends nor physician had&#xD;
been willing to sacrifice such a wealth of wavy gold. 'As&#xD;
Mr. Leonard held her hand, he bent the little emaciated&#xD;
fingers, ~nd called her attention to them, saying, "This will&#xD;
never do, Sylvia, I must take you to France, to Germany,&#xD;
perhaps to Italy, and we will see if your worn figure ~vil1&#xD;
not fill up with a softer outliiib: it will do you good to see&#xD;
something new."&#xD;
"how sadly I have altered, Marcus," sighed the wife, "it&#xD;
made me feel so badly when I looked in the glass a few days&#xD;
ago. You will not call me beautiful any more. Do you&#xD;
love me as well ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
A kiss upon her forehead accompanied the answ~r. "Do&#xD;
t judge inc so unworthily, sweet wife. I loved you for&#xD;
your beauty first, but now I love you and judge you by the&#xD;
temper of your spirit; this has always been most gentle to&#xD;
me. You will be the same to me in old age that you were&#xD;
in youth."&#xD;
"I thank you, Marcus !" murmured Sylvia, as tears roll-&#xD;
ea down her pale cheeks. "If J am a better woman than&#xD;
I was once, it is because y6u have been so patient in teach-&#xD;
ing me how to be good. God was very wise and merciful&#xD;
in giving me a husband like you."&#xD;
"Our lives are arranged according to a divine and perfect&#xD;
plan,~ and our marriage is one of the heaven-ordained inci-&#xD;
dents of the scheme. God forbid thatwe should not grow&#xD;
better for it: only after we enter upon eternity shall we be&#xD;
able to see the strange and subtle effects God designs to&#xD;
produce."&#xD;
A look of satisfaction passed over the wife's face: after a&#xD;
moment, she said thoughtfully, "Marcus, some lives are&#xD;
not arranged pErfectly, it seems to me. I have a cousin&#xD;
who is intemperate and cruel: he breaks his mother's&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"Wickedness is not an element of perfection, certainly,&#xD;
but each life is filled with opportunities to overcome it, and&#xD;
this conquest constitutes the "exceeding and eternal weight&#xD;
of glory." Your cousin's mother will doubtless become&#xD;
eventually capable of larger happiness through the suffer-&#xD;
ing her son causes, her: if he should not repent in this&#xD;

world, I more than half think God will in the next, pursue&#xD;
him with such nicety of discipline arid punishment, that his&#xD;
sins will weake~ before the strength of his Maker. And&#xD;
then-niay not some higher light come? some more cheer-&#xD;
ful warmth ?" Mr. Leonard was talking half to himself; half&#xD;
to Sylvia in the last sentences: his mind was borne ofl&#xD;
upon the deep sea Qf meditation: the child-like creature&#xD;
who leaned upon his breast did not like his problems when&#xD;
they took his thoughts from her. Would the fibres of her&#xD;
surface-love untwine from him, when yonder supernal&#xD;
light should break revealingly upon them.? It might be&#xD;
that one who was hers from the beginning, one to whom her&#xD;
soul was wedded when it was created, would find in her&#xD;
every want of his nature satisfied. It was enough that in&#xD;
the crude childhood of h~r being, she had fallen to the e~re&#xD;
of one who could make her lovelier, by the very dissimili-&#xD;
tude that was rooted in his nature. Occasionally a circum-&#xD;
stance transpired when Mr. Leonard keenly felt how little&#xD;
his wife was fitted for the society that was most congenial&#xD;
to him.: his discomfort was transitory; he grew- more great-&#xD;
hearted for bending down to study her good and her&#xD;
happiness.&#xD;

* After a week or two, Sylvia wa~ duly enveloped in&#xD;
shawls and wrappings, by her, nurse, and with her husband&#xD;
and little May, was conveyed on board a vessel bound for~&#xD;
the continent. When the party arrived at Pari~ she en-&#xD;
&#xD;
treated to stay and see some of the sights there. Mr.&#xD;
Leonard consented, although it haJ been his intention to&#xD;
leave immediately, and travel slowly along the banks of the&#xD;
Rhine. Sylvia was somewhat pleased with pictures and&#xD;
works of aPt, but she was truly in her element when she&#xD;
was shopping: an ambient sense of importance diffused&#xD;
itself within her bosom, when she was examining a "love of&#xD;
silk," or a piece of embroidery. Every day her wan face&#xD;
looked out of her carriage upon the busy streets and shops:&#xD;
little May's joyous countenance pressed beside hers, its&#xD;
English bloom contrasting with the mother's pallor.&#xD;
'While Sylvia was thus regaining a little of her former&#xD;
strength, Mr. Leonard received business letters that re-&#xD;
quired his immediate presence at Marseilles. lie left his&#xD;
wife in charge of May's nurse, for she had to take care of&#xD;
Mrs. Leonard during her illness, and set out upon his&#xD;
journey, expecting to be gone about a week. 'Released from&#xD;
her husband's watchfulness, Sylvia could not resist a long&#xD;
and thorough shopping expedition. Feeling unusually well,&#xD;
she started out the very day he left her, and went from&#xD;
street to street, and from store to store in search of a bon-&#xD;
net, a pair of gloves, and a pair of gaiters which would&#xD;
suit a rich silk dress lately purchased: at home or abroad,&#xD;
she liked new~ toilette; not one of the new articles would&#xD;
she put on, even in an emergency, before she could wear all&#xD;
together. Impressed with the importance of her mission,&#xD;
she battled with an extreme sensation of fatigue, and en-&#xD;
tered one more shop~ resolved that it should be the last for&#xD;

the day, whether she could be suited or not. A faintness&#xD;
overcame her as she reached the counter; she looked up at&#xD;
her maid imploringly, and sank upon a seat; she would&#xD;
have fallen ~to the ground, had not the women supported&#xD;
her. A grisette hastened for water, and after a little flutter&#xD;
among the customers, and a great flutter at Mrs. Leonard's&#xD;
heart, she was sumciently revived to be carried to her&#xD;
caleche: the poor child closed her eyes, consciouss only that,&#xD;
her head was whirring strangely she did not know any-&#xD;
thing properly until she found herself lying upon her bed,&#xD;
very ill. The nurse was especially alarmed, as Mr.&#xD;
Leonard had charged her to permit no imprudence; he&#xD;
thought his wife would be tis docile to her nurse, as to him-&#xD;
self; but this was a mistakefor Sylvia sometimes enjoyed&#xD;
having a little authority. She desired to do just right, but&#xD;
her child-like nature led her to be too intimate with her&#xD;
servants, and then to repair this defect, she resorted to an&#xD;
air of command that was uncalled for. She had been in a&#xD;
dignified frame of mind upon this day, henec the expostula-&#xD;
tions of her nurse had not availed in the slightest degree to&#xD;
curtail her movements. Now in ~ weakness, she sighed&#xD;
out, "0, Giles, I wish I had~ done as yoti wanted me to&#xD;
-Mr. Leonard will say I haven't a bit of judgment, when~ he&#xD;
is away! Send for the doctor, and perhaps he will cure ~-n e&#xD;
by the time my husband comes back; he was so kind ~to&#xD;
take this journey on my account. ' Take May from the&#xD;
room A her voice rings thro~igh and through my head !"&#xD;
A physician was balled, but his skill could not avert the de-&#xD;
&#xD;
lirium that came on at midnight: for th~'ee days Sylvia&#xD;
raved incessantly; upon the third night she lay perfectly,&#xD;
silent and motionless, and the weary nurse suffered herself&#xD;
to fall into a profound sleep; her head rested upon the cot-&#xD;
bed where little May slept. When the sick woman heard&#xD;
her heavy breathing, she lifted her head, and contemplated&#xD;
her a moment with dilated eyes, as if she had 'been a Gor-&#xD;
gon, then she murmured almost inaudibly, "I'll get away&#xD;
from her ! I'll go to Marcus !"&#xD;
* ~'She stole from her bed, and with the cunning of ir~s~nity&#xD;
robed herself in 'the nurse's coarse clothes, which hung in a&#xD;
closet hard by: as she did this, she kept her terror-stricken&#xD;
eyes upon the nurse, apparently driven to energy by the fear&#xD;
of her awaking: she took from a table the woman's bonnet,&#xD;
and then wrapping an old shawl about her, she softly&#xD;
advanced to the ,door in her bare, unslippered feet; she&#xD;
glided down the stairs, and through the dimly-lighted hall&#xD;
the heavy key of the front door baffled her, a moment, but&#xD;
with a desperate effort she turned it, closed the door&#xD;
noiselessly behind her, and then she found herself out upon&#xD;
the street: the night was damp and misty. Supernatural&#xD;
strength seemed to bear her on, as she glided like a spirit&#xD;
along the quiet ways, striving only to find darkness in which&#xD;
she might be concealed; her busy brain wa~ confounded,&#xD;
her sight was bewildered, yet she flew onward.&#xD;
It was broad daylight when the nurse awoke at the sound&#xD;
of May's exclamations. The chld sat up in the bed, look-&#xD;

ing toward the vacant one which had so recently been&#xD;
occupied by h~r mother.&#xD;
"Mamma! where's mamma ?" she uttered in a grieved&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
Mrs. Giles looked toward the bed, and gave a cry of&#xD;
alarm: it was indeed empty. She sprang from her chair&#xD;
and looked under it, lifting the valence; then she threw&#xD;
open the door of the closet, but she found no little thin&#xD;
figure crouched there ~ she searched her own chamber, her&#xD;
cheek growing whiter and whiter as she searched in vain:&#xD;
she felt like one accused of crime as she thought of Mr.&#xD;
Leonard's return. Overcome by the sudden fright, she sank&#xD;
fainting upon the floor. When she recovered, she commit-&#xD;
ted May to the care of the landlord's wife, and beginning at&#xD;
the garret, examined every room in the hotel: it was filled&#xD;
by strangers, yet many of them eagerly asked a description&#xD;
of the missing lady, and turned out to hunt for her. Mrs.&#xD;
Giles dressed May, and leaving her at the hotel she roved&#xD;
through the streets, and toward the river: she wandered&#xD;
out into the country, sitting down only to give way to a&#xD;
burst of tears. At nightfall, ~he returned to the hotel faint-&#xD;
ly hoping for good news. The landlord had dispatched men&#xD;
in various directions: he had caused handbills to be printed,&#xD;
d'eseribing h~r as a delicate English lady, who had driven&#xD;
through the streets every day for two weeks in a calech&#xD;
usually accompanied by her husband: latterly by a nurse&#xD;
and child: some few remembered her, but that was all.&#xD;
&#xD;
When Mrs. Giles asked, "Has she been found V' as she&#xD;
entered the dbor, the landlord replied;&#xD;
"Perhaps so! Mon Dieu, perhaps so&#xD;
"Where is she ?"&#xD;
"We don't know that! last night a policeman saw a&#xD;
woman running wildly toward the river, with her hair&#xD;
streaming loose. He could not follow her, foil he had a&#xD;
man under arrest !"&#xD;
"0, my heaven! my soul !" moaned the nurse. "And&#xD;
Mr. Leonard! has he come&#xD;
"No! I did not send a dispatch to him until ten&#xD;
Q'Cl0Ck !"&#xD;
Wringing her hands, the woman turned away, and mount-&#xD;
ed the stairs, meeting at the landing her foster-child, whose&#xD;
unpracticed feet were hastening to her: she carried the little&#xD;
one to her mother's chamber, and sat holding her in her&#xD;
arms during the whole night. Ere the dawn quite brdke,&#xD;
she heard sounding along the passage, her master's step: he&#xD;
opened the door of the room, and entered without any&#xD;
salutation; he looked eagerly around as if; against the&#xD;
assurances of his landlord, he might find that his wife had&#xD;
stolen to her chamber. his face was very pale, and his lips&#xD;
were shut hard together. ~ Is the child well '?" he asked,&#xD;
going to Mrs. Giles, and looking upon the face of the infant.&#xD;
The woman nodded, unable to speak: he questioned her&#xD;
rapidly of every minute circumstance connected with Sylvia&#xD;
-'he particularly inquired how her thoughts ran while she&#xD;

five minutes, he turned t ward the door to depart.&#xD;

impatient wave of the hand. "' The deed is don !" lie&#xD;
left her, and without taking food or rest, set abou making&#xD;
preparations to have the river dragged: everything~ seemed&#xD;
to point to the supposition that Sylvia had cast her elf into&#xD;
H            its silent waves: a boy, whom illness bad made restless,&#xD;
K&#xD;
was peering from an upper window not far from t e hotel,&#xD;
and had seen a slIght, small woman flying from that&#xD;
direction toward the wharf. One of the lodgers at t e hotel,&#xD;
testified that he heard some one unlock the door, as the city~&#xD;
clocks tolled three; it was but a moment after this, that the&#xD;
*       boy saw the flying figure: the policeman also testified that&#xD;
he had arrested the burglar a few minutes before three,&#xD;
hence when he saw the woman, it could have been but a&#xD;
short time after; he had had a short but desperate struggle&#xD;
with his captive, ere he had maimed him sufficiently to make&#xD;
him submit to his authority.&#xD;
During two days, the vicinity o the river was searched;&#xD;
a great lart of this time wa~ s ent by Mr. Leonard, in&#xD;
company with several men, upon he river; their boat was&#xD;
moored in a hundred different pl ces. At last, as the sun&#xD;
was settir~g upon the second day, swollen body was hook- ~&#xD;
ed, and dragged into the boat: m uch of the slight clothing&#xD;
had burst its fastenings, and had been swept away by the&#xD;

current: the sight was revolth~g-most revolting. Only&#xD;
the long ~vaves of hair retained any trace, of human attract-&#xD;
iveness; this wastangled about the disfigured and discolor.&#xD;
ed face; its golden tint was changed to brown by being&#xD;
saturated with the water. The figure was Sylvia's&#xD;
height: it was the face and form upon which the husband&#xD;
looked with a groan of horror: he turned away in deadly&#xD;
faintness; the tension of his nerves was gone; he sank&#xD;
upon a seat in the boat, and covered his face with his hands&#xD;
shudderingly. A human corpse is the most fearful sight&#xD;
~under heaven, nor are its ghastly terrors wholly lessened,&#xD;
when there is no fear of meeting death itself. Nearly all of&#xD;
life, and love, and glory that we know is shriried within a&#xD;
temple of flesh; the Almighty himself is apprehended by&#xD;
what we learn through man when the fire that He has&#xD;
enkindled retreats from its o~iter tenement inward, the&#xD;
dismantled habitation i~ terrific in its rum, it is left upon&#xD;
the face of the earth the briefest time, to tell its strange&#xD;
myth, and then it is buried from sight: what the corpse is&#xD;
without its informing spirit, man would he without God.&#xD;
Marcus, Leonard, carefully, yet with horrible emotions,&#xD;
examined the length of the hair, ahd the beautifully shaped&#xD;
teeth: other marks of identification were impossible.. He&#xD;
felt as if it were cruel to confound his wife with the&#xD;
loathsome mass of corruption before him: a blanket ~vas&#xD;
thrown over the remains: as the men pulled toward the&#xD;
shore, the waves were flecked with vermilion patches from&#xD;
the sunset sky. The pale American. kept his abstracted&#xD;

upon earth, though with far greater helps, still grow in&#xD;

Mo~ than a year had passed since the marriage of Dr.&#xD;
Kendrick and Isabel Deubrook. Few changes had fallen&#xD;
upon the little home which was i~hen instituted by the&#xD;
married p~1ir. They had left the five story house to occupy&#xD;
a small one in which they began housekeeping: moderate&#xD;
prosperity had attended them; Dr. Kendriek's steadily&#xD;
increasing practice, and Isabel's industry in copying law&#xD;
papers had enabled them to live in greater comfort than&#xD;
fok'merly. They had just moved into their new residence;&#xD;
two or three upper rooms were rented to lodgers ;Amy&#xD;
had her apartment upon the second floor; it was a pleasant&#xD;
room, into which the afternoon sunshine glimmered in&#xD;
scattering patches, as it broke through the rifts of a grape-&#xD;
vine; this thrifty vine was the glory of the house; the&#xD;
trellis had been built higher from year to year, until it over-&#xD;
topped the roof of the piazza, and even reached as high as&#xD;
the third story window~. It was about the middle of May,&#xD;
and Amy had just give~ the last adjusting touches to her&#xD;
room; its appointtnents~ were of the simplest description, for&#xD;
although she had been promoted in Mr. Hawks' school, and&#xD;

consequently received a larger salary than formerly, it&#xD;
would by no means -cover the purchase of any elegancies.&#xD;
Tngrain carp ting, new maple chairs, a small wash staind,&#xD;
looking glass and bedstead, with a cheap table containing a&#xD;
drawer, com41eted the furniture-of her apartment. She was&#xD;
well satisfied with this, for the room was her home, arid her&#xD;
soul lived as rich a 'life in it, as it could have done in a&#xD;
palace. She dreamed, and thought, and read, and sang&#xD;
within its limits : when she was exultant, she opened her&#xD;
table drawer, and wrote down the light poetry that over-&#xD;
flowed her heart: when she was- annoyed and discouraged,&#xD;
she wrote also, until she won to herself a sort of brightness&#xD;
that she could gain in no other way. Her time had passed&#xD;
cheerfully in the main, since she had become a teacher ; her&#xD;
heart was unoccupied by strong passions, and sometimes&#xD;
yearned for less quiet- experiences, yet she was too busy&#xD;
every day to be unhappy ; she had become ardently attach-&#xD;
ed to several of her pupils, and she delighted uto form their&#xD;
minds and hearts, and to be to them such a friend as they&#xD;
needed. .Mrs. Hawks had died about nine months after&#xD;
Amy entered the school; contrary to her expectation,&#xD;
she was called upon to till her place as principal; this&#xD;
position she had supposed would be given to a teacher .ho&#xD;
was older than herself, but Mr. Hawks thought otherwise-.&#xD;
Amy did not like to -govern, but she was able to do it, and&#xD;
she did it well, more to please Mr. Hawks than herself, for&#xD;
had it been her own school, she would have allowed far&#xD;
more freedom to the pupils ; the other female teacher laugh-&#xD;

41&#xD;
if&#xD;
&#xD;
ed out heartily at amusing incidents, and could be coaxed&#xD;
into anything, so that the school under her governance was&#xD;
often most disorderly. Partly on this account, and partly&#xD;
sethogher o reproof from Mr. Hawks, Amy taxed her-&#xD;
sel todo erbest: and thus she became the chief teacher&#xD;
under the great law-giver himself; even after she had&#xD;
ascended this dizzy height of fortune, she did not lose her&#xD;
awe of her superior ; if he spoke a little sharply to her, she&#xD;
was confounded, and explained the matter :he never rebuk-&#xD;
ed her enough to arouse her spIrit ; for some unexplain-&#xD;
able reason she could never be her free and careless self in&#xD;
his presence; if she wer'e tiptoeing around the room after&#xD;
school, humming a tune, and laughing to herself as she read&#xD;
a ludicrous conversation upon a slate which she had picked&#xD;
up, the entrance of Mr. Hawks gave a marked sobriety to&#xD;
her step, and she could no more hum on, than she could fly.&#xD;
She knew that lhe thought her a nice, prudent, quiet girl, and&#xD;
she could only display these virtues in his presence.&#xD;

set, and I shall go to it, God knows, unwil tingly. A woman&#xD;
,can break an engagement, and no 6ne blames her, but let a&#xD;
man do the same thing, and he is branded as dishonorable.&#xD;
I shall get to hating her; she will attempt to hold the reins,&#xD;
but she does not know Justin Secord, if she imagines that&#xD;
she will be successful.&#xD;
A knock at the door of his office, aroused Mr. Second&#xD;
from his unpleasant reverie: it was late in the evening, and&#xD;
his clerks had all left, oP retired ; the knock sounded upon a&#xD;
door that communicated with the street: he arose and&#xD;
opened it, and as the light~ fell upon tue stranger, he ex-&#xD;
claimed, " Why, I~arri~1gt9~~, is it possible ?"&#xD;
"It is possible, my good fellow !" returned Mr. ilarring-&#xD;
ton, entering and taking an office chair, "and the worst of it&#xD;
is, that I come on a graceless errand !"&#xD;
"Ah! hard up?"&#xD;
"No! nothing of that sort! I come to do you a kind-&#xD;
ness, and to be heai~tilv cursed for it !?'&#xD;
"Disinterested !" observed Mr. Second with a short&#xD;
laugh, and an uneasy expression of countenance. "Well,&#xD;
disclose the business ! the sooner the better !"&#xD;
"You expect to be married next week to Mrs. Collins !"&#xD;
"That is the arrangement, sir !"&#xD;
"When I tell you what I know about her, you will break&#xD;
with her !"&#xD;
"Hey ?" was the quick rejoinder, with an eager look,&#xD;
that was not all despair.&#xD;
Mr. Harrington looked infinitely relieved, and shaking&#xD;
&#xD;
[&#xD;
H&#xD;
&#xD;
hands with his companion a very long time, proceeded,&#xD;
"Now I can go on with a will! Y6u don't take it as hardly&#xD;
as I feared you would !"&#xD;
" Go on, sir! I want the ~vhole truth !" Mr. Second's&#xD;
countenance fell a little; after the first hope of breaking&#xD;
his engagement passed through his mind, he began to dread&#xD;
being coi~nected with public scandal.&#xD;
"You think Mrs. Collins is a widow, sir ?"&#xD;
Isn't she ?"&#xD;
"She is a divorced wife, and has no right ~to marry ac-&#xD;
cording to the laws of this state. Her husband is living in&#xD;
Georgia: he is married to a second wife, and has a family&#xD;
of children !"&#xD;
"Hu~ph !"&#xD;
"4 always rnarvel~d at you, Secord, that you would bave&#xD;
anything to do with her, when she advocated the doctrine&#xD;
of Free Love, and had so fatal an influence in leading&#xD;
Agnes astray !"&#xD;
"Is that so? She is then deceitful beyond the average&#xD;
of women! I understood from her that she lamented most&#xD;
profoundly the step which Miss Leonard thought best to&#xD;
take; she stated that the whole thing burst upon her like a&#xD;
thunderbolt from a clear sky! You know I have been r&amp;amp;&#xD;
served upon the subject with Mrs. Ashley."&#xD;
"The hag! it was her work, and she gloried in it I"&#xD;
muttered Mr. Harrington.&#xD;
"Good heavens! I am confounded !" cried Mr. Second,&#xD;

rising to walk the floor. " Why did I not know this&#xD;
before ~"&#xD;
"I supposed you had heard it mentioned, or hinted at, at&#xD;
least. I have beei on that woman's track from the time she&#xD;
left my house, nearly two years ag% and although various&#xD;
rumors reached me, it was not until this week that I ttaincd&#xD;
incontrovertible evidence of her infamous, most infamous&#xD;
character. Look at these statements !" Mr. Ilarrington&#xD;
drew from his pockets several letters and affidavits coming&#xD;
from different parts of the country, mostly from Southern&#xD;
cities, showing Mrs. Collins to be a woman whose career&#xD;
had been one of vice and shamelessness; a breath was&#xD;
stronger than her virtue; and yet so transcendent was her&#xD;
intellectual power that she was enthroned in hundreds of&#xD;
unsuspecting hearts as a very apostle of goodness and&#xD;
purity. The details of vice are always disgusting, and we&#xD;
will throw them into the shade as much as possible. Mr.&#xD;
HarPington had a last story for his companion's ear: the&#xD;
woman was even then cherishing a passion for a n~an of&#xD;
congenial character; a man whom she had won from a&#xD;
wicked paramour.&#xD;
These disclosures ocep pied hours, and the two men sat hi&#xD;
the counting-room until da~ break. XV hen Mr. Ilarri n gton&#xD;
rose to take his leave, Mr. Scored exclaimed, grasping&#xD;
his hand : "Ilarringtoi~, if I believed in special Provi.&#xD;
dances, I should say that such an one had directed you&#xD;
to come to me to-night. When you knocked at the door, I&#xD;
was saying to myself; that I would cheerfully part with two-&#xD;
&#xD;
ft&#xD;
&#xD;
thirds of my fortune to berid of that intriguing woman,&#xD;
yet 1 saw no honorable path out of my difficulty. I was&#xD;
entrapped into the engagement, although I seemed to form&#xD;
it of my own free-will: we were to have sailed for Europe,&#xD;
as you know : that was against my wishes also; her art in&#xD;
committing me to the plan was so subtle and powerful, I&#xD;
could scarcely say that the idea arose with her. I can&#xD;
manage men, and carry my point, but this woman is beyond&#xD;
inc. Thank God, I am a free man again! Keep this matter&#xD;
as quiet as possible."&#xD;
When Mr. Second was again left alone, scorn and indig-&#xD;
nation against Mrs. Collins took possession of him: yet with&#xD;
these sensations a glow of satisfied revenge mingled. lie&#xD;
took up a pen, and wrote to her as follows:&#xD;
"MADAM :-Having learned your history from authentic&#xD;
sources, permit mc to say that our engagement is at an end.&#xD;
"JusTIN SEcOnD."&#xD;
4&#xD;
When Mrs. Collins received this brief note, she was as&#xD;
usual stopping at the house of an acquaintance, whom she&#xD;
affectionately styled friend, so long as she needed. her&#xD;
hospitality. She was in her chamber, an elegantly furnished&#xD;
apartment, when a servant handed her the billet. She sat&#xD;
down miugligently upon a sofa to read it; the moment she&#xD;
had mastered its contents she sprang to her feet, and throw-&#xD;
ing it upon the floor, stamped upon it, muttering, "This is&#xD;
a cursed world, and everybody in it! I'll hunt my adver&#xD;

sary to the death! I'll blacken his or her name, and push&#xD;
the traitor to extremity; they shall swear my fame is tin-&#xD;
spotted as snow. But who has lone the work ?" she stood&#xD;
like a wild beast at~ bay, calling upon ~all the diabolism&#xD;
within her, to set in motion her mental powers. After&#xD;
thinking, with locked hands, and eyes upon the floor, for half&#xD;
an hoi~, she nodded to herself approbatively, and went to&#xD;
her secretary to pen a letter to Mr. Second. It was a&#xD;
singular letter, and conveyed no idea of the fierce passions&#xD;
that were wild within her. She asked as a simple act of&#xD;
justice that she should know her accusers: she spoke of&#xD;
one enemy who had done her harm, and she could conceive&#xD;
of no other person who bore her malice. her letter was&#xD;
brief; firm, temperate mid lady-like. When Mr. Second re-&#xD;
ceived it, he read it with a contemptuous smile, and threw&#xD;
it in the fire. She waited a few days in fiery impa-&#xD;
tience to receive an answer from him she that might&#xD;
know the extent of her power over him, and also the&#xD;
magnitude of the reports against ~er. She found that she&#xD;
must xvork alone, and in the dark, and she set herself to&#xD;
watching the people about her with cat-like slyness. She&#xD;
went into society perseveringly, and weighed every p~rsin&#xD;
with whom she came in contact, in the balances, tO ascer-&#xD;
tam, if possible who had betrayed her to the rich lover&#xD;
whom she had ~o nearly wedded. As often as the family&#xD;
carriage of her hostess was at leisure late in the afternoon,&#xD;
she rode out in it, with the blinds drawn closely; invaria-&#xD;
bly' she directed the coachman to drive slowly through the&#xD;

AMY DENBR001~.&#xD;
&#xD;
371&#xD;
&#xD;
business streets: she never failed to pass the tall stone&#xD;
I)LtIIding where Mr. Scored passed his days as a merchant&#xD;
prince; it was a week before she saw him emerge from it,&#xD;
and was able to follow him, that she mightlearn where he&#xD;
spent his evenings. 11cr suspicions turned toward Amy&#xD;
Denbroo k; judging her by her own character, she believed&#xD;
that revengeful feelings must slumber in her breast; she&#xD;
thought it natural that the toiling girl should weary of her&#xD;
homely lot, and sigh for the splendors which she had once&#xD;
rejected. Contrary to his usual custom upon leaving his&#xD;
store, Mr. ~ecord did' not proceed to his hotel; he went to&#xD;
Mr. Ilarrington's counting-room, to ask some questions&#xD;
about Mrs Collins which had occupied his mind for several&#xD;
days not finding~ him there, he ~vent to his house up town.&#xD;
Mrs. Collins' carriage fell behind the omnibus which h&amp;amp; en-&#xD;
tered; she saw' him go into the house of Mr. Harrington;&#xD;
driving around the block, she rode by the door again, and.&#xD;
this time, as fortune would have it, a light young figure trip-&#xD;
ped quickly along the sidewalk; a fair face looked casually&#xD;
toward the carriage; the cheeks ~vere softly flushed with&#xD;
earnest thoughts, and the whole brilliant expression of&#xD;
countenance night have been mistaken for joy and triumph,&#xD;
rather than interest and eagerness. Amy Denbrook (for it&#xD;
was she, and Mrs. Collins recognized her) mounted the&#xD;
steps that had been trodden a moment before by Mr. Se-&#xD;
cord, and was admitted by the san~ servant. Believing&#xD;
that she had found her most active eaemy in 8 rival, Mrs.&#xD;
Collins bit her lips, and felt her powerlessness: she cried&#xD;

&#xD;
out in her evil soul, "0, to be as a God 'that I might&#xD;
destroy them."&#xD;
Unconscious of the two who were iii her vicinity, Amy&#xD;
inquired for Mrs. Harriigton, and wa~ shown into her sit-&#xD;
ting-room, an ample apartment that connected with the&#xD;
parlor by folding-doors: these were closed, but the hum of&#xD;
masculine voices could be distinguished through them,&#xD;
although distance prcyented the recognition of pee ulkir&#xD;
tones.&#xD;
"See! I have a letter from Agnes !" exclaimed Amy, as&#xD;
soon as she had saluted Mrs. Jlarrington, whom she found&#xD;
alone; and she 'held out a white missiye.&#xD;
"Ah! is there any hope? tell me before I read it 3" en-&#xD;
treated Mrs. Jlarrington. "Will shc~~~~!'&#xD;
Amy shook her head, saying, "The letter is kind, and&#xD;
sounds, in some respects like her former self. Read it, if&#xD;
you wish, or shall 13"&#xD;
"Read it tq me, Amy, if you please !"&#xD;
It must be premised that a broken correspondence had&#xD;
been carried on between Amy and Agnes; the latter had&#xD;
written after the lapse of .a few months, inquiring about her&#xD;
aunt's family. Mr. llarrington had forbidden his wife to&#xD;
communicate with her niece, hence she only learned about&#xD;
her through Amy. * As Miss Leonard wrotexyith freedom&#xD;
regarding her happiness, it placed Amy in a position that&#xD;
had two alternatives: eitiiers she must write freely, or not&#xD;
at all. She followed theirnpulse of her heart, and penned&#xD;
every thought that can~ to her-her first epistle was irn-&#xD;
&#xD;
passioned, severe, tender, beseeching: it elicited a cold and&#xD;
haughty answer, albeit it was an elaborate defence of the&#xD;
system of free love. Several letters passed between the two&#xD;
that brought about no change of opinion on either side, then&#xD;
Amy said, "God is aboVe us both: we each think that we&#xD;
are right! Let us only love one another! Let us wait 1"&#xD;
It was a reply to this that Amy held in her hand:&#xD;
the greater part of the letter was filled with sight-seeing&#xD;
descriptions, but at the close, Agnes said, "There are many&#xD;
things in my life, which I could wish had not been, but of&#xD;
the events of the last two years, I can say, 'Allis well.'&#xD;
All my friends must feel upon reflection that I have been&#xD;
true to my convictions of right, and what else can they ask&#xD;
for me 3 Would that you, Amy, could understand the fi4-&#xD;
*      ness of rest and love that my spirit enjoys. You can never&#xD;
judge me truly, until you have been elevated by an equally&#xD;
pure and absorbing affection. I must say that contrary to&#xD;
your predictions, I still reverence Mr. Ashley as one of' the&#xD;
*     noblest of men. I feel sorry for you, dear friend, for with&#xD;
your understanding of my position, it must seem a guilty&#xD;
one. You have said many hard and cruel things to me, but&#xD;
I forgive you freely, because you have deemed it a duty to&#xD;
say them. .1 love you! I trust you! sweet old memories&#xD;
gather about me in the dim twilight, and I oft en put forth&#xD;
the arms of my spirit to fold, you to my heart. There is a&#xD;
deep tenacity in my affections, and Though shadows may&#xD;
,temporarily fall between me and those whom I have loved,&#xD;
there are times when I feel that they are still a part of me..&#xD;

&#xD;
My uncle Harrington will not at least forbid that you&#xD;
should tell m'y aunt that I remember her with fond and&#xD;
gr~~teful affection, flow willingly would I be the solace of'&#xD;
her declining years, if his prejudices did not keep me aloof!&#xD;
Your last letter gave me no pain: it gave me sincere hap.&#xD;
pines. I shall always be glad to rec&amp;amp;ve such letters. If&#xD;
yoi~ do not object, address your letters to 'Mrs. Ashley,' as&#xD;
I am called here by my husband's name.&#xD;
Yours faithfully,&#xD;
"AGNES ASHLEY."&#xD;
While Amy was reading. this letter in a low voice, Mr.&#xD;
Harrington and Mr. Second left the house, the latterlittle&#xD;
dreaming he had been so near the Once loved-maiden~; the&#xD;
sound of her voice would have aroused a strange sadness in&#xD;
his breast; the sight of her face would have been welcome&#xD;
as a vision of happiness: it would have responded to the&#xD;
cry of longing? that sometimes broke up from the soul of the&#xD;
business man, when labor and care were temporarily for-&#xD;
gotten. *Many there be who with tranquil countenance pace&#xD;
familiar pathways, while the heart is going forth in entreaty&#xD;
to meet 6y chance one banished face; it would so light up a&#xD;
dreary life, that one who tri~sts God's mercy can scarcely&#xD;
believe he will ~5Ieny the boon; and yet, every countenance&#xD;
is that of a stranger, and the pilgrim goes on his way,&#xD;
famishing; five minutes after, his footprints are touched by&#xD;
the desired one, and he never knows it. But Providence re~&#xD;
Lused the prayer, and threw in the moments that kept the&#xD;
&#xD;
two apart; years after, some sweet beseeching strain of&#xD;
music may recall that insatiate yearning, and in quiet grati-&#xD;
tude, the soul may murmur, "It was wise that the prayer&#xD;
was denied." If this acknowledgement never come on&#xD;
earth, it xviii break forth from the souls of the good, when&#xD;
the books are opened in heaven; the books of the past, and&#xD;
those of the future.&#xD;
While Mrs. Harrington and Amy were conversing upon&#xD;
Agnes, some fashionable callers were announced, and the&#xD;
younger lady arose to take her leave; the elder passed into&#xD;
the parlor through the folding doors.&#xD;
As Amy was passing through the hall, a sweet, childish&#xD;
voice called "Lady ?" she looked, around, and sitting upon&#xD;
the stairs, saw a little creature of three years old; she was&#xD;
an enchanting picture as she peered at the stranger a&#xD;
rnornen t, and then covered her eyes shyly with one little&#xD;
hand ; her attitude and looks were full of grace and' intellect.&#xD;
Amy paused, and looking through the banister, whispered&#xD;
smilingly, "0, what is your name? Araminta, R~xabella,&#xD;
or Cherubina ?"&#xD;
The child shook her head with an observing look at her&#xD;
questioner.&#xD;
"Say ?" continued Amy in the same confidential whisper,&#xD;
putting her hand through the railing, and touching the&#xD;
dimpled hand of the little one, with her forefinger: this the&#xD;
child appropriated, and with her two little hands pinched to&#xD;
the last degree of her strength, keeping her glance mean-&#xD;
while upon the countenance before her, and smiling as she&#xD;

376             AMY flE~flROOK.'&#xD;
&#xD;
began a fresh pressure. Amy at length closed her eyes, as&#xD;
if endurance had gix~en way, and withdrawing her hand,&#xD;
seized the banister, for a pretended support: when she ~igaiu&#xD;
looked at 'the cherub, her face was overspread with the&#xD;
deepest pity and concern: Amy smiled faintly and forgiving-&#xD;
ly, and this' was slowly repeated in the eyes, and upon the&#xD;
lips of the beautiful little girl.&#xD;
".Pince mine !" she asked, holding out her finger: her&#xD;
request 'was complied with. "P~nce harder !" she was&#xD;
again obeyed,. and w h.~en the little member was flattened a&#xD;
trifle to appease her sense of justice, she made, a motion to&#xD;
release it, with a i'ad hint and sati~fled expression.&#xD;
"Now if you'll kiss me, Ar~ininta, and put your arms&#xD;
around my neck, I may find myself able to walk home with&#xD;
this !" holding LI~ her finger, Amy went to 'the foot of the,&#xD;
stairs, and kneeling upon the second step, upturned her love-&#xD;
ly face for the kiss which she received: there was a window&#xD;
at the head of the stairway, and through i~ a sun-ray pour-&#xD;
ed) glinting across a little golden head, and illumining the&#xD;
aspect of the maiden: a step and 'hem!' With the xvord,&#xD;
"May !" uttered in a half remembered, half forgotten' voice&#xD;
from above, together with a moving shadow on the stairway&#xD;
wall, convinced Amy that her colloquy had been ovei'heard:&#xD;
she retreated toward the front door, while the child answer-&#xD;
e~i, "Yes, dear papa !" but followed after hem~ catching ~mer&#xD;
dress with the exclamation, "I'm May-May Leonard !"&#xD;
The young girl looked at her with a new interest, and&#xD;
thought th~t her father's spirit beamed through the softer&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DENBRO0l~.                   377&#xD;
beauty of her eyes, and gave to h~r the peculiar air of'&#xD;
intellect that prevaded her ~hi1dish bearing; the little arms&#xD;
were uplifted for a second caress, but Amy bent, and only&#xD;
kissed one sweet hand, with a smile that made compensation&#xD;
fur more elaborate endearments. Then she went out upon&#xD;
the street, and remembered that she had heard the voice of&#xD;
Marcus Leonard for the fir~t time in four years: she felt a~&#xD;
if she understood him sufficiently to know, that those years&#xD;
of his manhood were filled with rich treasure. Circumstan-&#xD;
ces had prevented her from regarding kim in any light that&#xD;
interested her feelings, yet there had always attached to him&#xD;
the charm that surrounds a person whom we can compre-&#xD;
hend. lie had never known her except as a rather shy,&#xD;
pretty, round-faced girl, who moved dimly in the baekgroui~d&#xD;
of a picture, whose foreground held Diana. Four years&#xD;
'had changed Amy's manners and countenance; the former&#xD;
were simple and unrestrained, as if she did not think about&#xD;
them: consequently she expressed herself in them more&#xD;
truthfully than when shyness held her a prisoner; formerly&#xD;
her physical beauty struck the observer, and in noticing her&#xD;
bright eyes and richly tinted cheek, with its full, soft out-&#xD;
line, few felt compelled to go beyond; but now the rose&#xD;
was a shade paler, and the soft outline less fuji~ it was as if&#xD;
her soul,. in living its own life, and gathering its own&#xD;
harvests, had stepped out from :its deep seem sion, and had -&#xD;
impressed itself upon her countenance, so that with the&#xD;
recognition of her beauty, came somewhat more of a per-&#xD;
ception of 'her character. This change is more frequently&#xD;

WHEN Amy reached home, the fading sunshine was meltir&#xD;
into the spring twilight. Diana Blake, who was now ti&#xD;
wife of George Coleman, gave a party upon this evening&#xD;
and as the sisters were to attend it, Isabel watched xvi&#xD;
some eagerness for Amy's 'eturn: ~he met her at the do&#xD;
with the exclamation, "Why Amy, there is hardly day hg&#xD;
enough to arrange our hair ! I've been expecting you eve~&#xD;
irUnute for an hour, and see what a figure 1 am !" Vexed b&#xD;
smiling, Bel pointed to the loose ringlets of bright h~&#xD;
that floated around her, waiting for Amy's skillful adjui&#xD;
ment. The two i'an up stairs fo Bel's chamber, and in&#xD;
few minutes the curls were incomparably settled to th&#xD;
position, combining in their twist and fall, the dignity 4&#xD;

un. After lo king at herself in the glass, she turned&#xD;
around wi9i a happy smile, to say, "isn't it pleasant, Amy,&#xD;
to know th~t I can never go to any l)lace with Ralph, whei~e&#xD;
he will see a human being who seems su fliir to him as I?&#xD;
You know this is not vanity, because I know that I am not&#xD;
thus viewed by others ; how easy it is to be good, when&#xD;
one is always judged indulgently; perhaps I should say,&#xD;
seem good."&#xD;
Amy smiled, and thought how easy it was to seem fasci-&#xD;
natin~ also to idolizin~ hearts: there Was often in Bel's&#xD;
manner to her husbaxid a pretty, winning archness that- was&#xD;
seductive even to Amy the very capacity for this pretti-&#xD;
ness is killed in woman's heart, by the loss of her husband's&#xD;
devotion, and she is upbraided, for the dimness that has&#xD;
fallen over her, by his acts.&#xD;
"It is not vanity ! I understand, Bel. I see ~o little of&#xD;
true conjugal affection, that I never tire of being convinced&#xD;
of its existence by you: this love is a poem that is sung by&#xD;
the few, not the many; it does not often bear the test of&#xD;
daily association, and xise higher and higher in the breast.&#xD;
When you sang in the choir la~t sunday, I noticed that&#xD;
Ralph looked at you from below, and then sent ~a gaze of&#xD;
scrutiny over all the female faces in the church; the quiet&#xD;
look that returned to your face an instant, and then dropped&#xD;
to the floor, was such an one, as many a neglected wife&#xD;
would have bartered a year of life for."&#xD;
Isabel blushed, and the thrill at her heart sent a tear to&#xD;
her eyes~&#xD;

At this moment, Dr. Kendijek called out from the foot&#xD;

can I read to you, if you won't come and hear me'?"&#xD;
"Yes! Yes !" they respondeQ remembering that they&#xD;
were to enjoy "Hypatia" for an hour or two before they&#xD;
went to the party. They hurried down stairs, where they&#xD;
fou~id the doctor walking up and down the parlor~ with the&#xD;

"One at a time !" he exclaimed, shading his &amp;amp;es from&#xD;

his look rested longest upon his girlish wife, whose dress&#xD;
set off bewitchingly her fresh roses and, blonde ringlets.&#xD;
Arriy's eyes followed his, and when their smiles met, she&#xD;
asked, "She looks a little shabby, don't she'?"&#xD;
Very !" he answered with his light laugh, which was full&#xD;
of music. "I never saw you look better, Amy !"&#xD;
"Didn't you'? 0, I'm delighted 1" The ladies took ota a&#xD;
little sewing from a work-basket, and busied themselves&#xD;
with it while Dr. Kendrick read aloud to them.&#xD;

While this domestic scene was transpiring, another quiet&#xD;
one was passing in the more elegant sitting-room of Mrs.&#xD;
Ilarrington: she sat beside her nephew, Marcus Leonard,&#xD;
in party dress also. Laying her hand upon hkl shoulder,&#xD;
she remarked affectionately, "You have been h~ re a week,&#xD;
Marcus, and this is the first quiet talk we have l~ ad ! You&#xD;
return to your fatherland satisfied, do you'? you x~tr ill be con-&#xD;
tent to make it your home?"&#xD;

AMY DENBROOK.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, most certainly! I have no household hearth of&#xD;
my own now, and yours, Aunt, seems most near to me. I&#xD;
have often looked back to it with a kind of longing, as if it&#xD;
could restore x~y childhood once more; with~ maturity,&#xD;
comes the heat and burden of the day !"&#xD;
"1 have often wished I could have seen your wife,&#xD;
Marcus! Does May look like her ?"&#xD;
"Yes! May is more beautiful than Sylvia was, and yet&#xD;
less so: her features are less perfect !" he took from his&#xD;
vest pocket, a small miniature~ and handed it to his aunt.&#xD;
"She looks like an angel !" said Mrs. Iiarrin~ton with a&#xD;
smile of pleased surprise.&#xD;
"Don't she? when I first saw her, she looked as if she&#xD;
had come down from heaven itself. She ~vas the gentlest,&#xD;
the most devoted of wives."&#xD;
Mrs. Harrington sighed, and then inquired, "have you&#xD;
seen or heard from Agnes since your first visit to her?"&#xD;
"I have received several letters from her, and written a&#xD;
number of times; we write mainly of common-places.&#xD;
There is no change in her."&#xD;
"I know. that, for I heard a letter from her read to-daly!"&#xD;
"Ah! who corresponds with her ?"&#xD;
"You recollect Amy Denbi'ook !"&#xD;
"Yes, and I saw her this afternoon, I think. Was she&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
"Yes !"&#xD;
"Then it was she, I heard a sweet-voiced woman talking&#xD;
to May, as I went from my room to call her. I never&#xD;
&#xD;
383&#xD;
&#xD;
thought Miss Denbrook so beautiful as she seemed to-day,&#xD;
when she knelt on the stairs and looked in May's face with&#xD;
~e light falling around her from the bay window above.&#xD;
She married Secord, I believe !"&#xD;
"No! she is not married: she teaches in a seminary !"&#xD;
"How's that ?" questioned Leonard, abruptly.&#xD;
"I hardly know, but I suppose the match was broken ~ff&#xD;
from want of congeniality !"&#xD;
"Which of the two discovered this want ?"&#xD;
"Amy, I suppose. She and her sister left the home&#xD;
which he had provided for them clandestinely. This must&#xD;
have been so, fo~' Mr. Second's manner of asking me if I&#xD;
saw the Misses Denbrook frequently, assured me that he did&#xD;
not know their whereabouts."&#xD;
"Strange! Why should they run away? Women have&#xD;
a curious way of doing things. He was their legal guar-&#xD;
dian, was he not ?"&#xD;
"No! he was their self-constituded friend; he sent them&#xD;
to school; and bestowed iPany benefits ~upon them, for which&#xD;
Amy's hand was to be the guerdon: she promised it, but&#xD;
as she grew older, more mature in character, she probably&#xD;
found that her whole heart could not accompany it, so she&#xD;
recalled it."&#xD;
"Aye! aye! It was a sad predicament for both. She&#xD;
loved another, did she ?"&#xD;
"No, but she evidently did not love him. I think the&#xD;
circumstance had a great effect upon her. I suspect that the&#xD;
person to whom Mr. Second has since been engaged, used&#xD;

some 'influence that determined Amy's course: the poor&#xD;
child heard a great deal about the sin of not seeking&#xD;
spiritual affinities."&#xD;
God only knows whether it be a sin or virtue to think&#xD;
too much4' of these things !" broke out Mr. Leonard, rising,&#xD;
and walking the floor, as was his habit when his mind was&#xD;
active. "There is a bound to such reflections: a solemn&#xD;
promise should lead one to deep questioning ere it be&#xD;
broken; it may be the finger of God pointing out the path&#xD;
of present self-renunciation; it may be a door opened&#xD;
toward well-doing, rather than happiness. But each honest&#xD;
spirit must judge of its own circumstances. Scored is very&#xD;
wealthy ~&#xD;
"Yes!"&#xD;
"It was well in him to choose a poor young girl: it ~as&#xD;
well in her to put away the prospect of riches. Heigho !" after&#xD;
a f~w turns across the room, Marcus stopt before the mantle,&#xD;
and looked at a small picture of 'Beatrice and, ~ante.' lie&#xD;
turned to his aunt- with a sad smile, saying, "She looks like&#xD;
Agnes I"&#xD;
"That is the reason I bought it!'&#xD;
"This person to whom Secord was recently engaged is&#xD;
the woman whom Agnes trusted so fatally, aunt ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Collins-yes !?'&#xD;
"Is Miss Denbrook infatuated with the same views?"&#xD;
"0 no ! quite the contrary !"&#xD;
"But she writes to Agnes, and you have said that Mrs.&#xD;
Collins had influence over her.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Doubtless she had, but she could have none now. 0, 1&#xD;
must not~orget to hand Amy her letter to-night; she diopt&#xD;
~ it as she went out of the room&#xD;
"She might drop it again at the party. Send it to her;&#xD;
it would be more safe, would it not? I should not like a&#xD;
letter from Agnes to be found; she has created too, much&#xD;
gosSip already !'~ after a libtie silence, he continued, "Amy&#xD;
had a sister ?"&#xD;
"She is married to the Dr. Kendrick whoni you fancied&#xD;
so much !"&#xD;
"tia! he was able to marry, was he?" Marcus smiled&#xD;
cordially. "And Diana, aunt? is she happily married?&#xD;
he blushed a little.&#xD;
"It was a true love-match, but; she will flirt a little&#xD;
A look of disapprobation passed over the countenance of&#xD;
Marcus. The hour fur going to Mi-s. Coleman's had arrived,&#xD;
and the sound of carriage wheels stepping before the house&#xD;
could be heard. Mrs. Harrington wrapped her shawl around&#xD;
her, and threw a veil over her head, then with her nephew,&#xD;
sought the street. The full moon was rising through clouds;&#xD;
broken masses touched with silver, went scudding across the&#xD;
heavens: a light wind blew hurry ingly: thQ scene awoke in&#xD;
the breast of Marcus a thought of vigor, of romance; a&#xD;
thought of something rich and new in destiny.&#xD;
Wifehood had made little change in the' gay manners of&#xD;
Diana: she was devoted to society as she had ever been.&#xD;

ing a moment In sileri he,. he wondered that he had ever&#xD;
thought her very pretty but when she smiled, he recog-&#xD;
nized the old attractiveness; she wore a dress of heavxr&#xD;
brocade, that exposed her beautiful neck and arms; she was&#xD;
more stately and polished than of old, save when her ring..&#xD;
ing, gleesome laugh broke out, and yet as Mr. Leonard&#xD;
observed her at a distance, he read 6n her brow and lip a&#xD;
change that set them far 4art; it reached him in the sound&#xD;
of her voice; he recognized the alteration for the better&#xD;
Which he had undergone himself; as he watched her, arid re-&#xD;
mernbered the sympathy that existed once between them : a&#xD;
coquettish style had become habitual to her; she ht~d grown&#xD;
superficial while his spiritual life had deepened, until he was&#xD;
no longer the gay young man whose heart ran over with&#xD;
gladness to catch her merry words he believed that the&#xD;
Divine fountain in her soul was hidden, and imperfectly re-&#xD;
flected the. light from above. When he looked within him-&#xD;
self; the words of insjiration arose in his thought. "All&#xD;
my fresh springs, are in Thee !" the path of life which had&#xD;
brought him to this acknowledgement seemed to him good:&#xD;
it saddened him to think of the wasted years that had goi~e&#xD;
over Diana's head. Not thus did his hostess muse regard-&#xD;
ing 1dm; there came to her heart an instant desire to&#xD;
awaken the old interest; she loved her husband passionatQ-&#xD;
ly, yet she sometimes looked back with a sigh to the days&#xD;
of her queenly power. Seeming accident threw the former&#xD;
lovers together; Diana's undisguised and laughing coquetry&#xD;
was responded to in a light vein, but it went very far toward&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DENBROOK.&#xD;
&#xD;
387&#xD;
&#xD;
divesting her of the charm that had clothed her, when Mr.&#xD;
Leonard had sometimes looked back upon the dream of his&#xD;
first love. As they talked, Mr. Coleman occasionally sent&#xD;
a look of anxiety toward them; Am y, who could not keep&#xD;
from noticing the three, understood George's character.&#xD;
sufficiently, to divine the uneasy current of his thoughts: he&#xD;
at length approached his wife, and joined in the conversation,&#xD;
which immediately turned upon Mr. Leonard's residence&#xD;
abroad; in due time he led Diana to a lady, who ~ad&#xD;
expressed a wish to s~e her; the brief; sudden compression&#xD;
of her lip showed that she understood his motive: with&#xD;
characteristic perversity, she said, after she had gone a few&#xD;
steps with him, "I'll take another direction, if you please,&#xD;
sir !" and quietly threading the crowd, she sought Amy,&#xD;
instead of the person who had asked for her: there was an&#xD;
excited flash in her eyes, as she talked of the weather and&#xD;
the company, while she almost unconsciously followed her&#xD;
husband's movements. Amy spoke of the beauty of a&#xD;
young bride who was present.&#xD;
"Yes! how long will it be before her husband turns Blue&#xD;
Beard, I wonder !" exclaimed Diana. '%M~~ chains are of&#xD;
gold, but still I sometimes remember that they are chains!"&#xD;
Amy who had only heard her friend speak in joyful&#xD;
strains of her wedded life before, was a little surprised at&#xD;
the bitter accent that fell upon 'her ear, kit she answered in&#xD;
a whisper: '"Sh! be a g6od child to-night, and to-morrow&#xD;
you will 'remember how happy your lot is !"&#xD;

" she did not finish the sentence, for as she strove to&#xD;
smile, her lip quivered with the real anger that trembled at&#xD;
her he4rt. This same species of anger had lived in Amy's&#xD;
breast in the old times, although arising from a somewhat&#xD;
different cause. She feared to see it sway Diana, whose&#xD;
impetuous will could brook control. with little patience.&#xD;
This was proved in a short time,~ for leaving the corner&#xD;
where she had been for a moment secluded, Mrs. Coleman&#xD;
called to her aid all the enchantments of her wit, and made&#xD;
herself the centre of such a circle as she had not gathered&#xD;
about her~ since her marriage. She forgot he~' sacred wife-&#xD;
hood in thus endeavoring to show her husband that she&#xD;
would resign adulation only at her pleasure, and not at his&#xD;
bidding. Amy's eyes were fixed upon her regretfully;&#xD;
there was a pain at her, heart, as she realized how weak Was&#xD;
her personal influence :-Diana had said but the week&#xD;
before that it was strong over her.&#xD;
"Miss Denbrook, have you forgotten me '1" asked Mr.&#xD;
Leonard, who stood unexpectedly at her side; he had been&#xD;
observing her, and in his mind had pronounced her the white&#xD;
rose of the collection: her simple history had interested&#xD;
him more deeply than his manner had shown.&#xD;
"Not entirely, sir !" she answered, turning toward him,&#xD;
and extending her hand with a smile. "Old acquaintances.&#xD;
are not so easily forgotten."&#xD;
It was not exactly pleasant to him that she said "ac-&#xD;
quaintances" rather than friends, but he continued: "Time&#xD;
has touched all people with his alchemy in' four years; there&#xD;
&#xD;
a~e twenty people here whom I knew before I went to&#xD;
England, it is strange to see care-~vorn countenances where&#xD;
so short a time ago, we saw smiles but one can get over&#xD;
this arid see the old familiar face breaking through: it is&#xD;
less' agreeable to read a growing hardness in some of the&#xD;
~young faces that promised better."&#xD;
"Yes!" responded Amy, "for in the first case we can&#xD;
hope that there is genuine youth within, which will appear&#xD;
-" she hesitated, smiling, and added "up there !" ~vith a&#xD;
slight lifting of her finger.&#xD;
Mr. Leonard bowed, with his thoughtful smile which said&#xD;
more than words, and sometimes took the place of them.&#xD;
Amy had hesitated, because sometimes when she had as it&#xD;
were, involuntarily giyen expression to her thoughts she&#xD;
had discovered a sudden loss of sympathy on the part of&#xD;
her companion: thus she had learned to keep tiiany of her&#xD;
sweetest thoughts. tp herself, when she met others. It was&#xD;
not so now, for as she talked she~ realized that she was corn-&#xD;
prehended; Mr. L&amp;amp;onard had flung around her lisad a rain~&#xD;
bow of light-his imagination had pictured the hour when&#xD;
she should stand among the angels,'in the upper world. A&#xD;
little confused and startled by his earnest, admiring look ,she&#xD;
dropt her eyes and opened her fan, that most delightful re-&#xD;
source in embarrass ~nt; in another moment, they were&#xD;
discussing some antique trifles that ornamented the table by&#xD;
which they stood: and then, they danced together once;&#xD;
after this Mr. Leonard conversed with old friends; he took&#xD;
an early leave with his aunt, and Amy' knew the exact&#xD;

&#xD;
moment of his departure, although she did not look toward&#xD;
the door, but continued a lively chat with a portly old&#xD;
;gentleman who seemed delighted with his own happy style&#xD;
of wit.&#xD;
Arrived at home, Mr. Leonard immediately sought his&#xD;
room; the old roam where he had slept and studied in the&#xD;
"long ago." He sat down by the same escritoire, and after&#xD;
a long, wistful look upon the floor, where he of course saw&#xD;
nothing but the past and present, he began to write, and to&#xD;
wonder 'why his eyes had been sealed when a vision of "The&#xD;
unknown woman" had passed before them years befQre:&#xD;
when he had first seen Sylvia Stonehouse, he had believed&#xD;
that his counterpart stood before him; n ow, he again&#xD;
believed that he had seen his embodied ideal: hisprevious&#xD;
error suggested monitions of prudence, lest he should&#xD;
repeat a similar mistake: it wa~ this prudence that had re-&#xD;
moved him from Amy's side, and that restrained him from&#xD;
bidding her "good night," least his eager dreams 'should flash&#xD;
into her consciousness: he marvelled that her rare presence&#xD;
had not riveted his spirit before; having known her&#xD;
imperfectly, he did not see that she was more worthy than&#xD;
she had been; her whole being was now tinged with' a&#xD;
golden warmth from God; to the superficial, she was&#xD;
perhaps less charming than she had been, but with the good,&#xD;
her'soul bloomed out in all its frLinkness, and innocePee, and&#xD;
enthusiasm.&#xD;
And Amy ! she sat alone in her chamber that night, with&#xD;
a smile upon her lips, and a tremulous beating at her heart;&#xD;
&#xD;
with a half fearful look upward, she prayed, "0, deliver&#xD;
me not to uncontrollable passion, Almighty Father, if&#xD;
renunciation must, be required of me !" She felt as if she&#xD;
stood upon the brink of some tremendous change; a vision&#xD;
of her awakened spirit passed in review before her, and she&#xD;
cowered under the tyranny of such love, as seemed now&#xD;
possible to her for the first time: she cowered to see what&#xD;
her helplessness might be; yet she thanked God that he had&#xD;
endowed her thus'= though at the' risk of suffering. In&#xD;
former days, all that she had ever understood of love, had&#xD;
been revealed to her by George Ooleman; even when&#xD;
engaged to Mr. Second, her fettered heart had turned to him,&#xD;
as to the only one who had unlocked its chambers vet he&#xD;
had but the key to the outer courts; she had some~mes felt&#xD;
a kind of arrogant pride in knowing that she could be the&#xD;
conqueror of herself-that judgment could triumph over&#xD;
feeling. The calm 'and solitary places within her vibrated&#xD;
no longer to the' past; she had never upon intimate&#xD;
acquaintance, seen a man who had not some point of&#xD;
character that seenied better fitted to another woman than&#xD;
herself; pretty and intelligent, she could not be without&#xD;
admirers at any time, but they remained such, or turned to&#xD;
others, without assuming the character of suitors; in fact, she&#xD;
'had' interested no one whom she had~ liked and respected as&#xD;
heartily as Mr. Second or Mr. Colemam Her youthful&#xD;
belief that "the right one" existed, and would come to her,&#xD;
was still in her heart. When after absence, she and Mr.&#xD;
Leonard met, they had each entered upon a new~ phase of&#xD;

lifc: they clung to no fancied idols; they looked at each other&#xD;
attentively and untrammelled for the first time, as it were;&#xD;
each had somewhat of a clue to the other's c~ist of A~honght,&#xD;
and to the effect which the experiences of life had prod uced.&#xD;
He had asked "Is it she? the unknown woman ~" as a&#xD;
peculiar, spiritual loveliness invested her, and set her apart&#xD;
from other women. If Amy had obeyed her impulse,&#xD;
which she did not, she would have dashed upon paper a&#xD;
thousand thoughts and feelings that night; she looked forth&#xD;
upon the future which lay before hei' like a shoeless sea-a&#xD;
beauteous sea; she reached upward through the splendor&#xD;
unto God~ But she hushed the poetry. that sprang unbidden&#xD;
from h~r heart, and after an hour had gone in dreaming,&#xD;
started up in bashful self-reproof: she unbound her hair&#xD;
and resolutely took out her breast-pin, saying, so that ~he&#xD;
oould l~ear the chiding, "Amy! Amy! because he is-so&#xD;
different from other men, his look appears a' different, and&#xD;
seer~s to convey-" here she came near getting into&#xD;
another vision; she broke, it oil; by taking off her belt with&#xD;
unusual dispatch, and continuing: "It is so incredibly fool-&#xD;
ish in a person to' become interested in another, when that&#xD;
person may never have dreamed of such a thing; particular-&#xD;
l~ foolish in a woman-I do despise it so heartily! yes! so&#xD;
heartily !" now this last " so heartily " was a mechanical&#xD;
repetition of thei former, and as she said it, she slowly&#xD;
unclasped a bracelet of ~ hair, and looked at it, and&#xD;
then fastened and unfastened it; and then she laid it down,&#xD;
and folded her hands together, and smiled as she mentally&#xD;
&#xD;
repeated some words which Mr. Leonard had spoken; thus&#xD;
was she again borne out in fancy upon the scoreless sea, and&#xD;
who shall say how long ~he dreamed, and how sweet were&#xD;
the dreams~&#xD;
She remembered that she must have left her letter at Mrs.&#xD;
Ilarrington's, as she had not folded it when~ she had finished&#xD;
reading it, and must have dropped it in her hasty exit from&#xD;
the apartment, when a fresh call was announced to Mrs.&#xD;
Harrington: consequently it seemed to her certain that Mr.&#xD;
Leonard would soon bring it to her, or that he would call to&#xD;
renew his acquaintance with Dr. Kendrick.&#xD;
The next day, every duty seemed linked with a gracious&#xD;
presence; she knelt at her bedside, and her morning prayer&#xD;
was rather a smile of love and trust to God, than a&#xD;
petition; 'she felt as if another prayer winged its way to&#xD;
the same throne, and as if she were not forgotten in it. She&#xD;
sought for songs of joy and triumph when she turned to the&#xD;
saCred page. She added several slight graceful touches to&#xD;
her dress, and gave to her soft ringlets a thoughtful pare,. as&#xD;
if there were happiness in bestowing upon her persQn some-&#xD;
thing that might reflect the new harmony within. Perhaps&#xD;
all this care had not so poetical an origin; perhaps she&#xD;
.should not wish to ornament herself when she returned&#xD;
from school, as if she expected a guest. The day passed&#xD;
away unlike all other days, and the eVening came; the&#xD;
young teacher sought her room after tea, and sat down to~~&#xD;
write a letter; leaving it unfinished, she busied herself with&#xD;
hemming a ruffle; har~lly had she taken a dozen stitches&#xD;

&#xD;
when through her open door came the tones of voice which&#xD;
had sounded in her heart all day; she heard the light,&#xD;
cordial laugh with which Mr. Leonard said, "Doctor, I have&#xD;
come to see you in. your own home! How is the little wife&#xD;
to-night? tired of dissipation ?"&#xD;
"No, sir, not at all !" said Isabel's voice at the parlor&#xD;
door; it closed in a moment, and Amy hemmed serenely -&#xD;
for a quarter of an hour oi~ her ruffle; at the expiration of&#xD;
this period, the door below opened; and Bel's footsteps were&#xD;
beard mounting the stairs. We do n~t always feel equal to&#xD;
disclQsing the current of our reflections, even to the dear~t&#xD;
friend on earth, and Amy would have blushed to have&#xD;
given any sign of hers to a human being, so she hastily re-&#xD;
sumed her pen and bent over her discarded letter.&#xD;
"Come down in the parlor, A~ny !" exclaimed Isabel,&#xD;
entering the room. "Mr. Leonard has called to see the&#xD;
doctor !"&#xD;
"0, has he ?" was the reply. "1 thought I heard some&#xD;
person come in !'~&#xD;
"Come down, will you ?"&#xD;
"After awhile! I haven't finished this letter yet! Look!&#xD;
I've sewed all this beside-.-havn't I been quite industrious ?"&#xD;
she held up the ruffle.&#xD;
"Yes, but let the writing go now !"&#xD;
"Well! I'll be down in a few minutes !"&#xD;
And so she went down; the conversation was for a&#xD;
moment interrupted between Dr. Kendrick and Mr.&#xD;
L~onard, as the latter arose and shook hands with her; she&#xD;
&#xD;
took a seat by a little stand where Bel sat with some netting&#xD;
ifl her haifd, which she only occasionally consulted: Amy&#xD;
occupied herself with similar work, and frequently threw in&#xD;
a general remark, while Isabel joined with animation in the&#xD;
discussion, which related to the condition of the lower class-&#xD;
es in Europe. There was nothing in the manner or conver-&#xD;
sation of Mr. Leonard to indicate that Amy had any con-&#xD;
nection with his visit, save that when she spoke he looked&#xD;
toward her with a more listening attitude than before. lie&#xD;
took an early departure, saying as he arose, "Mrs. ilarring-&#xD;
ton sent you this letter by me, Miss Deubrook! I believe&#xD;
it has your address upon it !" and he gave her the docu-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Thank you! I was careless to leave it !" she returned.&#xD;
"I am very glad that it was safe !"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
&#xD;
"UPON leaving Dr. Kendrick's house, Mr. Leonard went&#xD;
to the city Post Office, where he expected to find letters&#xD;
* from abroad. lie was not disappointed; among the nuni-&#xD;
ber was one from Agnes: this he did not read until he had&#xD;
returned home. A part of it ran thus:&#xD;
"We shall leave in the next steamer for New-York; un-&#xD;
expected and rather unfortunate business will require Mr.&#xD;
Ashley's immediate attention there. Marcus? shall I meet&#xD;
* you? I do not expect to occupy my former position among&#xD;
my friends, but I thinI~ there are two or three, who will not&#xD;
be afraid to clasp my hand once more for the sake of&#xD;
earlier days. I shall not go to aunt's, nor I fear will she&#xD;
come to see me, against uncle's will. There is but one&#xD;
thing that I would like to obtain from home, and that is a&#xD;
box of papers: it would be of trifling import to any one&#xD;
else, and perhaps its contents have been thrown in the fire.&#xD;
ere this. There were old school compositions in it; some&#xD;
of them were mine, and some of them I begged from the&#xD;
dearest of my school-mates. There were a doz9n of your&#xD;
letters; you wrote them to me from Yale, when we thought&#xD;
&#xD;
no change of opinion could ever estrange us. It may be&#xD;
that. you will care enough for the past, to read these records&#xD;
which were freighted with affection and hope; it may be&#xD;
that some lonely evening y~u will bend above them, and&#xD;
perusing the story of your brotherly tenderness, xviii, find&#xD;
it revivified for me! 0, Marcus! Marcus! do not be unjust&#xD;
still! do not forget that I am Agnes! that the same father&#xD;
and mother left us orphans! that when we returned home&#xD;
from the last grave, you folded your arms around me, and&#xD;
said 'Death itself shall not loosen our love, Agnes!'&#xD;
"Your letters now do not upbraid me, but you are stern&#xD;
and severe; you do not always feel for me a Christ-like&#xD;
charity. I am a Magdalen to you! This is not so in&#xD;
truth; it is the unloving wife who is the Magdalen, n otJ,&#xD;
who am a genuine consort, legalized by the most sacred&#xD;
affection."&#xD;
With a sigh, Marcus laid down the epistle; he unlocked&#xD;
a deep drawer in his escritoire where the well-known box&#xD;
had heen deposited by Mrs. Harrington, when Agnes' room&#xD;
had been turned into a guest chamber. He drew forth hfs&#xD;
own letters, hardly recognizing his once beautiful chiro-&#xD;
graphy which had undergone the change consequent upon&#xD;
much and rapid writing; this change in his style of pen-&#xD;
manship symbolized the alteration which had taken place&#xD;
in himself; he thought now much more of an idea than of&#xD;
its vesture-.---much more of spirit than matter, hence his pen&#xD;
no longer betrayed in its careless ease, the nice grace of'&#xD;
old. He sat until past midnight reading the letters: ~iot&#xD;

39S          AMY DENBROOK.                                       AMY DENJ3ILOOK.          399&#xD;
&#xD;
~unfrequently did he pass his hand across his eyes to make&#xD;
the words clear; he opened one of his sister's compositions,&#xD;
and pressed his lips upon the writing ere he gave up his&#xD;
task, and retired. When he awoke in the morning his first&#xD;
thought was of Amy :---perhaps some of her com positions&#xD;
were in the package. Knowing how ho had inve ted one&#xD;
beautiful woman with the intellect 'which he had de ired her&#xD;
to possess,' he was most anxious that the attract n which&#xD;
drew him to Amy, should have its foundation ii herself,&#xD;
rather than in his own imagination: hence a recor of her&#xD;
simple thoughts acquired importance.&#xD;
He found a compositAon which had been written 'when she&#xD;
and Agnes were about seventeen: it was a spirited satire&#xD;
against superficiality and foppery in man and woman: Mr.&#xD;
Leonard smiled at its witty, girlish scorn, and then with&#xD;
dreamy eyes upon the floor, smiled more softly to recall the&#xD;
mellowed, spiritual sweetness that exhaled from her every&#xD;
look and thoughtful word now: her light words were light&#xD;
as ever, but they carried no sting as they sometimes did&#xD;
aforetitne: he tore himself from his reverie to read with&#xD;
graver interest the burst of indignation that closed her&#xD;
essay, and the wide soaring belief in humanity's best possi-&#xD;
bilities. 'The unformed style of her composition had to his'&#xD;
partial heart a charm: he was not critical as to manner, for&#xD;
he sought only to find indications of character, and these he&#xD;
found: Amy would have shed almost tears of vexation,&#xD;
had she known of his inspection into her crude, saucy&#xD;
pages: he saw the deepening, etherializing glow that had&#xD;
&#xD;
come to her since. As he folded the document, and once&#xD;
more in fancy gazed within her eyes, he said of her, "Most&#xD;
human most heavenly." He found in the box letters&#xD;
from the schoolfriends of Agnes :-there were several,&#xD;
directed in Amy's handwriting. An eager curiosity to de-&#xD;
vour them, seized him, but he put them out of his sight,&#xD;
pervaded by. a new sense that was delicious: henceforth&#xD;
every gate of his soul's temple should be thrown open to&#xD;
the white feet of his priestess: every thought, every act of&#xD;
his 'nature should be laved in waves of purity that she&#xD;
might hear and see the motion of the life that was, asby a&#xD;
mii'aele attracted to her it surrounded her as the sky&#xD;
bends to the sea: as the sunshiny air drinks deeply of the&#xD;
rose's heart, and wins its perfume: he listened as if spell-&#xD;
bound to the entrancing poem that had come to him so sud-&#xD;
denly. Where indeed had the splendor been kept by God&#xD;
so long ~ this deepest spring of hope. had broken from its&#xD;
fathomless deeps at sound of the electrical voice: at sight&#xD;
of the spiritual face: aye, the very motion of her gliding&#xD;
form, moved him as if she were walking through all the&#xD;
rarest gardens of his being: he thought he had loved deep-&#xD;
* ' ly, but such 'love he had never dreamed of': it thrilled&#xD;
all the sleeping world within him, as Eden moved musically&#xD;
when the foot of Adam entered its precincts.' He wonder-&#xD;
ed if this spring were now unsealed in Amy's nature.&#xD;
With singular faith, he felt that he was the magician; that&#xD;
he should unlock the mysterious kingdom all flushed With&#xD;

&#xD;
tropical splendors, that lay per~1u so long. Perhaps she&#xD;
heard his approach. Aye, she heard the step of her king!&#xD;
Though possessed of poetic tendencies Marcus Leonard&#xD;
was not a poet: he dreamed sweet idyls, but he usually&#xD;
awoke to the, requirements of common sense, and lowered&#xD;
his visor when he went into action. lie emerged from his&#xD;
warm dreams to look at facts: he recalled with disquiet the&#xD;
incident that had shadowed his heart a little the night be-&#xD;
fore. Amy had not hastened int~ the parlor, when it seemed&#xD;
to hini that she ought to have had a presence of ~iis&#xD;
coming: she had been somewhat reserved, and had appe~ir-&#xD;
ed to show more, interest in Dr. Kendriek's remarks than&#xD;
his own. her vis9r was down to conceal the thrillings of&#xD;
her heart: she was ashamed of them : she had no right to&#xD;
thrill, when she had iiot been asked to. .Yes, she had been&#xD;
wooed with subtlest, spiritual asking, and the voiceful&#xD;
presence was ever taking possession of her thoughts, her&#xD;
feelings, her heart-beats: she had no need to blush, and&#xD;
to strive to put away the image: methinks it was true;&#xD;
it was a strong man's spirit praying to her in yearning;&#xD;
methinks it was not her fancy that she contended with, but&#xD;
the resolute will of Marcus Leonard.&#xD;
While he was scheming for an excuse that evening to call&#xD;
at Dr. Kendrick's, his aunt requested hi&amp;amp; company for the&#xD;
opera, which she anticipated attending': he of course could&#xD;
not decline. When he was on his way there, Amy sat at&#xD;
home, endeavoring to solve a. mathematical problem, which&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DENBROOI~.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
would benefit a certain pupil, and herself also. Dr. Ken.&#xD;
drick came into the room, exclaiming, "Upon my word,&#xD;
Bel, if your head did not ache so, I should stay all night&#xD;
with the Bryne's: that woman's gloomy face goes straight&#xD;
to my heart: she can only live a few days and her husband&#xD;
is prostrate with a fever !"&#xD;
"Is there no one to take care of them ?" inquired Isabel.&#xD;
"You are called up so much nights, Ralph, you ought not&#xD;
to go !"&#xD;
"If the man were not there, I ~would stay tonight with&#xD;
the woman !" said Amy. "Is. he in the same room&#xD;
"No! he is in a little room adjoining. I wish you would&#xD;
go, sister; he needs attention also. I believe you could&#xD;
make the death-exit of Mrs. Bryne less dreary if you would&#xD;
talk to her !"&#xD;
"I'll go !" answered Amy, closing her book. "Shall I get&#xD;
ready now&#xD;
"Yes! I am going there immediately. I'll be back in a&#xD;
short time, dear !" The doctor stroked his wife's hair, ask-&#xD;
ing, "No better yet ?"&#xD;
"Not much !"&#xD;
Twenty minutes after this conversation, the doctor and&#xD;
Amy, stood within the lowly tenement of Michael Bryne.&#xD;
lTpon a small cot in the larger room lay the wife, in the&#xD;
last stages of consumption; as the young girl approached her,&#xD;
she exclaimed, "0! Miss Amy !" with a look of surpi~ise.&#xD;
"Do you know me ~ Why Mary, is it you '~ returned&#xD;
her visitor, as the wan face broke over her recollection. I&#xD;

thought you were still at service in Mrs. Harrington's&#xD;
family. I have been there so seldom for a year or two.&#xD;
How long have you been married ?"&#xD;
"Almost a year !"&#xD;
"Does Mrs. Ilarrington know of your sickness ?"&#xD;
"0, yes, she often visits me; but she has not been here&#xD;
since N~Iichael was taken down."&#xD;
"I am going to ~ta~ with you to-night," said Amy unty~&#xD;
ing her bonnet a~ d sitting down by the bed-side. The&#xD;
doctor, gave several simple directions relative to both his&#xD;
patients, and then the young watcher was left alone to her&#xD;
task: it seemed a grateful one, since she ~had discovered in&#xD;
the woman a servant of Mrs. Harrington's, who had&#xD;
fancied her in times past.&#xD;
A worn bible lay upon the stand. "You are a protestant&#xD;
Mary !"' said the young girl taking it up; she observed that&#xD;
a deep melancholy settled upon the sunken countenance&#xD;
after the surprise of meeting was olYe2r.&#xD;
"Yes ma'am !" was the quiet reply.&#xD;
"Shall I read the chapter that begins, "Let not your&#xD;
heart be troubled ?"-~-or would you like to be quiet ?"&#xD;
"I'd like to hear the chapter 1"&#xD;
Amy shaded the woman's eyes from the light with a fan,&#xD;
and' read in a low voice a part of the chapter. "Did you&#xD;
ever t~ink Mary what a beautiful Providence it is," ~he&#xD;
said, "~hat as soon as these frail bodies, become useless we&#xD;
can thr~w them aside and, enter another world where we&#xD;
shall not need them ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
The invalid turned upon her the eyes which sickness had&#xD;
made so large, and answered with pathos, "I don't want to&#xD;
die! I can't leave Michael! I don't want to be laid in the&#xD;
cold ground !"&#xD;
"You will never be laid in the cold ground !" replied&#xD;
Amy-" God did not create you for that !"&#xD;
"I'm dying." She held forth her skeleton hand and&#xD;
whispered, "this will soon be under the sod. I thought I&#xD;
was a christian, but I don't love the Lord's will."&#xD;
"You don't understand it~, dear. You think the Lord is&#xD;
less good than 'he is. 'There is a natural body, and there'&#xD;
is a spiritual body.' 'Do you see this glove?' she lifted&#xD;
the article from her lap and drew it on, continuing, "~Can&#xD;
you see any thing of my hand now ?"&#xD;
"No, ma'am !"&#xD;
"And yet I can do a thousand things through this glove;&#xD;
you know that my hand is within it; when the leather be-&#xD;
comes worn from constant use I can throw it aside; it will&#xD;
be worthless, like the poor earthly body that yoI4 regret to&#xD;
part with. Immortality does not resume corruption; the&#xD;
spiritual body spoken of 'by St. P~ul, first begins to act&#xD;
without its material covering in the next world: it does not&#xD;
resume its shell; it is compared to ~rain the seed of which&#xD;
springs from the earth leaving behind its outer covering."&#xD;
An expression of ~eagerness and hope answered the&#xD;
speaker, but th~ cloud returned, and 'Mary Bryne said,&#xD;
"The Bible says that at the last day the dead shall be calL.&#xD;
ed from their graves. It is a long time from this to the&#xD;

"Th~ dead in trespasses a~d sins, shall be called to judg-&#xD;
ment, as was shown in th story of the rich man and&#xD;
Lazarus; we are taught that the rich man went immediate-&#xD;
ly to judgment; Lazarus w~eiit to his reward ~ Dives is&#xD;
represented as talking with Abraham, and crying for water&#xD;
to cool his tongue. This shows that he was in a spiritual&#xD;
body, while his natural body lay uselessly embalmed in his&#xD;
sepulchre. When Moses and Elias appeared beautiful ~ind&#xD;
glorious, talking with Jesus upon the mount of transfigura-&#xD;
tion, could they have talked and listened unless they had&#xD;
possessed organs of speech and hearing? When you die,&#xD;
Mary, you will, not have need of your material body as&#xD;
they had not of theirs. 'There are also celestial bodies,&#xD;
and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of th&amp;amp; celestial is one,&#xD;
and the glory of the terrestrial is another.'"&#xD;
"I see It! I see it !" cried the sick woman with a look&#xD;
of rapture. "0, where has been my faith? how could I be-&#xD;
lieve that God would imprison my body, and leave my&#xD;
soul to float about like wind, until it was joined to it. I&#xD;
used to think about playing upon a golden harp in heaven,&#xD;
but for a few days I have kept saying to myself, 'Though&#xD;
worms des troy this body,'~-it seemed as if I could not&#xD;
finish the text. I bless God that you caine to rne~ I shall&#xD;
see God in the spiritual body that Paul spoke of."'&#xD;
"That is it," said Amy with a delighted smile.&#xD;

"Do you think the Lord will place me on the right hand,&#xD;

nave yOU tried to obey His commandments ?"&#xD;
"I have sinned a great deed, but I have tried to follow my&#xD;
Saviour."&#xD;
"Then He will take you to His kingdom."&#xD;
A beautiful light passed over Mary's countenance: she&#xD;
smiled, and folded her hands in still and rapt devotion n.&#xD;
Amy moved her chair to the table, and took out her sew-&#xD;
ing7 after having looked into the chamber occupied by Mr.&#xD;
Bryne; he looked fixedly at her from under his bushy brow;&#xD;
she retreated, 'a little frightened, without putting fresh ice&#xD;
upon his head as she had intended to do; after a moment&#xD;
she arose and put down~ her work to wait upon him,&#xD;
ashah~ed of her weakness. Ere she could reach him he&#xD;
called impatiently, "Woman !"&#xD;
She was not reassured by this, but went to him, saying,&#xD;
"I am going to put fresh ice upon your head as the doctor&#xD;
told me." She took the napkin which was nearly dry&#xD;
from the intensity of the fever, and filling it with ice placed&#xD;
it upon his head again; she then asked him if he would&#xD;
have anything, but he only glared at her without reply.&#xD;
She would have questioned Mary about him, but on return-&#xD;
ing to her, found that she had dropt asleep. Re-seating her-&#xD;
self upon the little wooden chair frofri which she had risen,&#xD;
she began involuntarily to think of a delirious patient of Dr.&#xD;
Keudrick's who had required four men to hold him.&#xD;

"Pere, you strange woman ! Water ! Give me water,&#xD;
or I'll kill- ye !"&#xD;
Her heart leaped into her throat at the low fierce&#xD;
whisper, but seeing no alternative, or escape from her duty&#xD;
as an attendant, she obeyed his call, and hastily pouring- out&#xD;
a cup of water, would have given it to him ; with a sudden&#xD;
spring. he raised, himself in the bed, and taking it from her,&#xD;
drained it. "Colder ! Give me mnor&amp;amp; !"&#xD;
I'll get some ice from the hall and .put in the pitcher,"&#xD;
she articulated, leaving the chamber and passing through&#xD;
Mary's room 'to the entry, where she discovered a large&#xD;
quantity of the desired article. JJpon returning to Mr.&#xD;
Bryne she found him resting on one elbow, waiting for her ;&#xD;
she handed him arsecond cup of water.&#xD;
"Sit down ori that chair !" he said, taking it from her,&#xD;
and nodding his head toward ghe seat designated.&#xD;
"1I am your nurse, and you must do as I say," she falter-&#xD;
ed, leaning against .the wall.&#xD;
"I want to look at you," he persisted more wildly.&#xD;
"Sit down there !"&#xD;
She took -the seat, looking at him the while as' if he had&#xD;
been a, wild animal- who bright make a second spring: he&#xD;
put the water to his lips. At this moment the knocker of&#xD;
the street~door sounded. .Amy started to her feet gasping,&#xD;
" Oh !" she was so thoroughly frightened that the sound&#xD;
connected itself with something terrible and undefined&#xD;
about to happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
" There was a knock at the: door, please," said Mary's&#xD;
quiet voice. "Such a beautiful dream I had !"&#xD;
The wvatcher proceeded down stairs and opened the&#xD;
front door.&#xD;
"Good heavens, Amy !" exclaimed the voice of Mrs.&#xD;
Harrington. "'Are you here ? What is the matter ? is&#xD;
she dead ?'&#xD;
The candle that lighted Amy's pallid face wavered in her&#xD;
hand;- she stept back and sank upon the stairs, uttering,&#xD;
It's nothing !"&#xD;
Mrs. Harr'ington took the light from her, saying to a&#xD;
gentleman who accompanied her, "She is going to faint,&#xD;
and-?'&#xD;
" No she isn't going to faint," replied AMny, taking hold&#xD;
of her friend's dress~ with one trembling hand to assist her&#xD;
in rising. ".Please go up stairs, I will follow in a moment."&#xD;
" But what has frightened you ?"&#xD;
" Mr. Bryner is delirious ; I'm so glad you've come !"&#xD;
Amy looked up into Mr.- llarrington's face as she supposed,&#xD;
but it was Mr. Leonard's. Seeing that he hesitated to go&#xD;
and leave her, she continued, "Il come now !"&#xD;
" Lean on my arm, Miss Denbrook."&#xD;
.She accepted the offer, and -they ascended the stairs to-&#xD;
gether, preceded by Mrs. H~arrington.&#xD;
" Who's that woman ? Come here !" came from the&#xD;
little bedroom the moment they ha~d all entered Mary's&#xD;

Amy's terror, and went to the sick man; the pale nurse sat&#xD;
down quietly by Mary's bed.&#xD;
"I mean't to have called here many hours ago, Mary,"&#xD;
said Mi's. Harrington bending over her, "but company de-&#xD;
tained m&amp;amp;; we are on our return from the opera! I have&#xD;
something for you in the carriage. Here comes Ben with&#xD;
the basket now !"&#xD;
The coachman entered a~d deposited his burden upon the&#xD;
floor. "I am surprised to find Michael sick," observed&#xD;
Mrs. llarrington. After a kind conversation with her for-&#xD;
nier servant, sha turned to Amy and said, "Marcus will&#xD;
stay I suppose, and take care of one of your patients."&#xD;
"I devoutly hope so !" answered Amy, looking toward&#xD;
Mr. Leonard, who approached from the other apartment.&#xD;
"Indeed is it Mr. Marcus got home !" exclaimed Mary,&#xD;
who' had not observed him before; she held out her hand&#xD;
with a look of welcome.&#xD;
"Yes, Mary, it's pleasant ~o see you once more, although&#xD;
I am sorry to see you so ill."&#xD;
"I am very happy, Mr. Marcus! I'll not hold back wjien&#xD;
the Lord calls."&#xD;
Mrs. Harrington rose, and bade Mary good night.&#xD;
"You won't object to my sharing your~ watch, Miss&#xD;
Denbrook ?" said Mr. Leonard with a smile.&#xD;
" No, sir ?" was the ready answer.&#xD;
"You must make a cup of tea for yourself; for you are&#xD;
still pale as a lily," exclaimed Mrs. Harrington, patting&#xD;
Amy's head, and then stooping to kiss her. "You will find&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
what you want in the basket." After she had gone, Amy&#xD;
endeavoured to tempt the invalid woman's appetite with the&#xD;
various delicacies, which had been brought in; in this she&#xD;
did nOli succeed very well; she yielded herself to Mary's&#xD;
eager solicitations to put upon the table some refreshments&#xD;
for herself and Mr. Marcus: the latter personage kind ledal&#xD;
fire in the little cooking stove, and filling an ancient tea..&#xD;
kettle, placed it upon it.&#xD;
"I shall consider this supper an admirable~ feature, if my&#xD;
patient will allow me t~ partake of it with you, Miss Amy"&#xD;
observed Mr. Leonard as the voice of Mr. Bryne summon-&#xD;
ed him to his place in his room.&#xD;
Steam went up in' wreaths from the kettle, and the Hyson&#xD;
steeped many minutes in the little brown tea-pot ere the&#xD;
continued silence in the adjoining apartment induced Amy to&#xD;
call out softly, "Mr. Leonard ?"&#xD;
He came out, and they, sat down to the table ivhich was&#xD;
furnished from Mrs. Harrington's larder; the cups ar.d&#xD;
saucers were bedecked with flowers of blue, red, and green.&#xD;
Under any other circumstances, neither o( the watchers&#xD;
would have thought it possible to have enjoyed such a mid-&#xD;
night repast. As it was, Amy looked toward the bed,&#xD;
before pouring out the first cup of tea, saying, "Isn't this&#xD;
nice, Mary?"&#xD;
Mrs. Bryne smiled in, reply, but shook her head when&#xD;
Amy offered her some of the fragrant beverage. A church&#xD;
clock very near at hand struck the hour of one with a deep&#xD;
reverberating sound.&#xD;

"It seems so," she responded, laughing, "I wonder if&#xD;
friars and nuns have little suppers like this ?"&#xD;
"Not like this," he answered with an emphasis that sent&#xD;
the color to her cheek, hitherto so pale.&#xD;
"Mr. Bryne is asleep, I suppose," she said, passing a.&#xD;
saucer of jelly. "I believe it is my fault that his fever ra.ri&#xD;
so high; I was talking with Mary and forgot to renew the&#xD;
cooling applications."&#xD;
When the meal was concluded, Mr. Leonard returned t~&#xD;
his patient. Amy washed the dishes as noiselessly as&#xD;
possible, atid then sat down by Mary.&#xD;
"Rest your head down here, and go to sleep now, Miss&#xD;
Amy. 1' shall not need any care until morning; if I do I&#xD;
xviii waken you."&#xD;
Believing that Mary would feel more at ease if she follow-&#xD;
ed her suggestion, the fair nurse laid her cheek upon the&#xD;
bed, and apparently composed herself to slumber: sleep&#xD;
was far from her, although the burden of her care had fallen&#xD;
away. An hour elapsed and then Mr. Leonard passed&#xD;
through the room to get some ice from the hall; Amy did&#xD;
not move, but in a moment she felt that her light shawl&#xD;
which hung upon a chair, had been carefully wrapped&#xD;
around her: the fire had gone down, and the night had be~&#xD;
come a little cool.&#xD;
At the earliest break of day the watchers were startled&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DEI~13R001~.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
by a summons to the street door; it was Dr. Kendriek,&#xD;
who had come 'to relieye his sisteriri-law.&#xD;
"how are they? and how did you happen here, sir," he&#xD;
asked, surprised at meeting Mr. Leonard, who admitted him.&#xD;
The incidents of the night were related~&#xD;
"Mr. Bryne is conscious now, is he? said the doctor~&#xD;
after he had listened to the story; he wouldn't l~ave been&#xD;
delirious if my directions had been followed, Amy, you&#xD;
deserve to be- "&#xD;
"Revered ?" she suggested, stepping back as if to shield&#xD;
herself front his rebuke. "I ant very sorry, Ralph."&#xD;
He smiled, and replied, "you've done very ~vell; put on&#xD;
your bonnet and run home now-the neighbors can take. care&#xD;
of Mrs. Bryne duPing the day. I'll relieve you also, Mr.&#xD;
Leonard. Tell me which medicine you gave last I" The&#xD;
two gentlemen went into Mr. Bryne's room.&#xD;
Amy, who was putting on her bonnet, kissed the brow of&#xD;
her whose days were numbered, and calhin~ "Good&#xD;
morning, Mr. Leonard ! I thank you for helping me&#xD;
disappeared from the scene of her late vigils. Mr.'&#xD;
Leonard's heart suddenly fell at' her abrupt departure; he&#xD;
had half expected ~to walk home with her in the morning&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
MRS. COLLINS was pacing the floor of the handsome apart-&#xD;
ment in which we have seen her; her intriguing brain was&#xD;
laying stratagems upon false premises. It had been forced&#xD;
upon her mind from Mr. Second's stern silence, that he was&#xD;
~lost to her; she was considering whether it would pay to&#xD;
persecute him, and her scipposed rival: this would have&#xD;
been an interesting pursuit,. if it did not involve the proba-&#xD;
bility of, her own more public exposure. Her condition&#xD;
was nearly desperate, for the coldness of her host and&#xD;
hostess increased daily, and she had contracted many debts&#xD;
which were to have been discharged from Mr. Second's&#xD;
revenues. She ran over in her mind every eligible bache-&#xD;
br, widower, or young man whom she had the faintest hope&#xD;
of charming; but time and study 'were needed to storm&#xD;
rind capture the fortress of their affections and weaknesses,&#xD;
and time she had not. She cast herself upon a sofa, and&#xD;
buried her forehead in her hands; her heart was full of irn-&#xD;
potent, revengeful misery. The voice of the postman in&#xD;
the hall below, aroused her; she hastened down, to inquire&#xD;
if any letters had come for her;, she was rarely away from&#xD;
&#xD;
the house; whefl the letter-carrier arrived, for she had much&#xD;
correspondence that she preferred to keep secret: her trust&#xD;
in others did not permit her to believe that a seal was a&#xD;
safeguard to a letter under a~l circumstances. She found&#xD;
what she expected and more, for she looked with curiosity&#xD;
and apprehension upon a package of papers, which were&#xD;
directed to her in a strange hand. Upon returning to her&#xD;
room, she locked the door, that she might be free from in~&#xD;
terruption, and broke the red wax that fastened the enve-&#xD;
lope: several sheets of foolscap were sewed together, and&#xD;
upon them followed a dozen letters i.rm succession; turning&#xD;
to the first page; the bewildered Wo'mnan read:&#xD;
"MADAM&#xD;
"The enclOsed letters have been copied from&#xD;
originals which I have in my possession. I send them for&#xD;
your careful inspection: if. hfter reading them you deem it&#xD;
best to haunt respectable society, I shall make it a point to&#xD;
present the prdof of your character, which is herein&#xD;
contained, td each and all of the persons who have harbored&#xD;
you, or countenanced you under mis-apprehension. I shall&#xD;
not hesitate to say what I know of you, at any time&#xD;
occasion may demand.&#xD;
"Yours &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
"JouN HARRINGTON."&#xD;
It would be vain to attempt a description of the malig-&#xD;
nant anguish 'that devoured the betrayed woman; she saw&#xD;

&#xD;
appended to the several letters the names of gentlemen who&#xD;
had known her for a term of' years; they were men of&#xD;
principle and standing in their separate communities : they&#xD;
had learned that she was a serpent by the poisoned sting&#xD;
which she had left upon her victims. Never before had sh~&#xD;
operated upon so large a field as New York had afforded&#xD;
her, and never before had so rich a matrimonial prize seem-&#xD;
ed within her reach. One of the 1e~ters was from her hus-&#xD;
band, whom she had infamously wronged. Perfect as was&#xD;
Mrs. Collins' self-control before others, it gave way complete&#xD;
ly when she met misfortune in solitude: she flung her hair&#xD;
down, as if' its weight distracted her, and wrubg her hands,&#xD;
while her lips hissed words of profanity and shame. After&#xD;
her passion had spent itself; her keen intellect began to&#xD;
make the best of circumstances; she sat down, and pushing&#xD;
from her white face, her disordered hair, bent her eyes,&#xD;
flaming with infernal suffering, upon the cai'pet. If one&#xD;
could have looked in upon her spirit, could have read its&#xD;
history and retribution, he would have recoiled from sin,&#xD;
knowing that it carried its punishment within its bosom,&#xD;
and was heaping up its burning coals even in momentsof&#xD;
triumph: the present suffering of the unfortunate woman,&#xD;
scarcely shadowed forth the tremendous wrong which she&#xD;
had for years been doing hersoli'; the temple of'her spirit&#xD;
was burned and charred by unholy fires; though its deso-&#xD;
lations could be partially concealed by blandishments oii&#xD;
this side of death, a time was hastening when all should&#xD;
* yield to expositions of character. "For there is nothing&#xD;
&#xD;
covered, that shall not be revealed: and hid, that shall not&#xD;
be known."&#xD;
She had but one course open before her~and that was to&#xD;
fly to some strange place; she fixed upon a southern city&#xD;
where she had never been; she was reduced to the&#xD;
humiliating necessity of' asking her host to lend her the&#xD;
means of transportation: this he did with actual cheerful-&#xD;
ness ,glad to be relieve&amp;amp; of her at so light a price.&#xD;
Within twenty-four hours of the receipt of Mr. Harriug-&#xD;
ton~ s message, Mrs. Collins was on board a train of cars for&#xD;
the South; she spoke freely of the. place where she intended&#xD;
t9 go, but it was not of course the place, that was to receive&#xD;
her.&#xD;

CHAPTER xxxiv.&#xD;
A WE~H or two after the watch at Mrs. Bryne's, Amy Was&#xD;
going to school as usual; as she passed Mrs. Coleman's&#xD;
windows, she glapeed up at them, and saw Diana. who&#xD;
nodded imperatively, and tapped upon a pane of gla~s, ore&#xD;
she disappeared, and then re-appeared at the front door~&#xD;
exclaim in~, 0, come in a moment! I want to talk to&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
"Can't !" responded Amy, laconically, as she hesitated,&#xD;
smiling. " It is almost nine o'clock ?"&#xD;
"Agnes has com~! I saw Mrs. Harrington last night,&#xD;
who told me. I'm going to see her; will you go with me ?"&#xD;
"Yes! with pleasure! When ?"&#xD;
"This afternoon !"&#xD;
"I'll go? where is she ?"&#xD;
"$he is keeping house in a little suburban cottage, near&#xD;
harlem. I'll have the carriage ready at four o'clock, when&#xD;
you will be returning from school !"&#xD;
"Will you drive past hozine, so that I can stop. a&#xD;
moment ?"&#xD;
"Ceitainly! don't fail !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"George is willing, I suppose !"&#xD;
0, 1 presume so! I can mollify him, if he isn't I"&#xD;
Dia~ia smiled contentedly, from which Amy judged that all&#xD;
was smooth between the pair.&#xD;
"I'll be here in time! Good bye !" and the teacher&#xD;
hastened on.&#xD;
Amy was true to her word, and appeared at Mrs. Cole-&#xD;
man's door at four o'clock. In a few moments they were&#xD;
seated in the carriage; after a brief call at Dr. Kendrick's,&#xD;
they proceeded to their place of destination.&#xD;
"have you seen Mr. Leonard lately ?" asked Diana.&#xD;
"lie called to have a chat with the doctor a few evenings&#xD;
ago; I saw him but a moment in the hall, for I was just&#xD;
going out with Mr. Hawks to buy some drawing books for&#xD;
the pupils."&#xD;
"With M. Hawks? a widower I believe ?"&#xD;
"Yes, a few weeks ago I heard that he offered himself to&#xD;
a very wealthy widow, who refused to be borne off in his&#xD;
matrimonial talons; I'm not afraid of him any more-he&#xD;
has fallen to the ordinary level."&#xD;
There was something in Diana's appearance that led Amy&#xD;
to believe she had been deeply disturbed; after trying to&#xD;
keep up conversation, she said:&#xD;
"'What is the matter, Diana i?"&#xD;
"I hate men 1" was the passionate answer. "I said&#xD;
sum thing at dinner about the return of Agnes, whereupon&#xD;
George exclaimed, Your connection with her is forever&#xD;
ended; of course.'"&#xD;

"Why !" cried. Amy, surprised. "Did be ~nall'y&#xD;
consent to your calling on her ?"&#xD;
"No! he don't know I am going! I thought I would&#xD;
take a little latitud~ behind the scenes."&#xD;
Her companion looked out of the carriage window&#xD;
thoughtfully, and then replied:&#xD;
"Diana, I think you are not doing exactly right. Pcr&#xD;
haps if you had talked to him quietly when he was in the&#xD;
proper mood, he might have consented. Don't go if he is&#xD;
opposed to it."&#xD;
Diana's lip curled scornfully. "Tell me why he should&#xD;
dictate to me! give me a just reason for it! I have brain,&#xD;
and will, and predilections, a&amp;amp;well as he! so long as I am a&#xD;
docile toy, George is pleased with me; when I act upon my&#xD;
own God-given instincts he ceases to love me~ unless they&#xD;
accord with his own. Agnes is as pure as a l4ly in spirit&#xD;
although worse Women whom I associate with regard her&#xD;
with disdain. What is the difference betwixt her and me?&#xD;
She would sacrifice herself to Mr. Ashley's happiness far&#xD;
more than I would to George's. I love the world too well&#xD;
to have courage for such a step as she has taken. But I will&#xD;
not cast a stone at her. Men rebuke us for our coldness to&#xD;
fallen women, but if we stretch out a h~nd to help lifL theni&#xD;
up, our fathers, husbands, and brothers, forbid our (dlaritv."&#xD;
~1*&#xD;
But in this case, said ~-~my, half smiling, your&#xD;
charity can lift no one up, and Agnes would lie the last one&#xD;
to raise dissensions between you and your husband. Let&#xD;
&#xD;
AMY DEN BR0OI~.                  419&#xD;
me go to her alone, and I will tell her that you still feel&#xD;
the deepest interest in her."&#xD;
"No !" was the determined response.&#xD;
"But we gain so much by seeming to yield I" Amy laid&#xD;
her hand upon her ~ generous man is always&#xD;
overcome by an affectionate self-sacrifice."&#xD;
"l've yielded and yielded, Pm tired of it."&#xD;
"And I'll warrant George has yielded and yielded; I&#xD;
know you well enough for that. You and he have each an&#xD;
extraordinary amount of self-will. You used to say you&#xD;
liked his lordly ways."&#xD;
"lie is too arbitrary."&#xD;
"You should remember that this fault of arbitrariness is&#xD;
his heritage; he has a thousand noble qualities beside it;&#xD;
help him to overcome it !-tell him of it lovingly some&#xD;
time after you have given up your will to his. Begin&#xD;
to-day to do him good by not acting contrary to his wishes.&#xD;
Stop the carriage, and 1 ct me go to Agnes alone; we are&#xD;
nearly there, and I dan return home by the cars!"&#xD;
A soft shadow came over Diana~ s countenance~ She&#xD;
meditated a moment hnd then shook her head slowly, say-&#xD;
ing, "George requires too much of me. I would have told&#xD;
him wherein Agnes differed from the unfortunates ~vith&#xD;
whom he classed her, but ho forbade my uttering a word&#xD;
about her; he said the subject ~vas hateful ~o him. I will&#xD;
not bend my neck before such injustice." The carriage&#xD;
rolled on, and sh~e fell into silence. She ~oon resumed,&#xD;

&#xD;
'~You know me thoroughly, Amy; you know I am a&#xD;
coquette by nature. When I married George I wanted to&#xD;
be a faithful and devoted wife; I cared for no man's admi-&#xD;
ration save his for a long time, but the novelty of our&#xD;
union wore off a little, and I missed the stimulus of&#xD;
flattery to which I had been accustomed. I remember the&#xD;
very day when I thought it would be pleasant to be a belle&#xD;
again as I had been; I fled before this thought, knowing&#xD;
that if cherished, it would destroy my domestic happiness.&#xD;
I never was created fbr a mere housewife. I cast about for&#xD;
something to engage my intellect, and divert my feelings;&#xD;
suddenly I thought I would write for publication under a&#xD;
nom de plume; .1 wrote a story, and i'ead it to George;&#xD;
he praised it, but said he disliked literary women, and he&#xD;
hoped that my ambition would never reach in that direc-&#xD;
tion. A few days afterward I told him I thought I would&#xD;
be happier if my time were occupied in literary pursuits:&#xD;
I told him there w~s a restless craving 'in my heart. and&#xD;
that I should care less for society if I could dr6am out my&#xD;
tl~oughts on paper. lie only answered, 'Diana, I shall&#xD;
never consent to your beco~ning a blue-stocking!'&#xD;
"dne link in the chain of my affection broke at his&#xD;
words. I should have been a better wife had he consulted&#xD;
my l~appiness in this respect ."&#xD;
" I think you are mistaken, Diana, in giving to circuit~&#xD;
stances such power to make you good or bad. You c~n&#xD;
still 1e the faithful and devoted wife you intended to be,&#xD;
&#xD;
notwithstanding what has happened. If we really try to be&#xD;
come what we wish to be, all incidents will help, and not&#xD;
retard ~&#xD;
"I can't forever remember to check my impulses; I&#xD;
hate this compulsory process of amendment."&#xD;
"Angels are never made in any other way. We are not&#xD;
always borne on pinions to right states of feeling."&#xD;
"If I should gall George beyond just such a point, woe&#xD;
is me. He would be desperate when thoroughly aroused.&#xD;
I cannot be humble because he thinks I should be."&#xD;
"I think you are perilling your happiness and his love by&#xD;
flirting as you do."&#xD;
"You misjudge me, Amy ;. I rarely ask any thing but the&#xD;
light of his smiles: I only flirt a little when he vexes me."&#xD;
"Perhaps you do not realize how such conduct burns into&#xD;
George's very heart; he does not revenge himself by a like&#xD;
course, hut doubtless he ponders these things, and sometime&#xD;
you may be terrified to find what you havc done."&#xD;
"When I am with you, Amy, I s~e and feel as you do,&#xD;
but I am like the house whose foundation was of sand, my&#xD;
purposes are swept away by the first flood of temptation.&#xD;
0 that I had been circled about from childhood by influences&#xD;
like yours." She sighed heavily, as the carriage drove up&#xD;
before a pretty cottage with a flower garden in front.&#xD;
Upon inquiry it was ascertained that Mr. Ashley lived&#xD;
there. The ladies were ab\ ut to descend upon the sidewalk,&#xD;
when it occurred to Diana o send her own card with Amy's&#xD;
wune upon it, to the door, to ascertain if Agnes were ulj&#xD;

&#xD;
home. She was not; this was a relief to Amy, who thought&#xD;
Diana was in no mood to listen to the sophistries of Agnes.&#xD;
When they were on their way home, Diana exclaimed,&#xD;
"I am glad we didn't find her! I don't feel as wicked as I&#xD;
did; I'll please George. lie is a magnificent fellow, isn't&#xD;
he ~ The other day he was in the basement when a feeble&#xD;
old woman came' to the door to sell thread and needles; he&#xD;
gave her ten dollars, and spoke so kindly to her, I thought I&#xD;
never should be angry with him again as lqng as I lived."&#xD;
Diana's spirits eVidently rose as she contemplated the&#xD;
bright side of her husband's character. She showed Amy&#xD;
with childlike pleasure a costly diamond cross which he had&#xD;
given her on her birthday. When they parted her face&#xD;
beamed with sunny affectionate smiles.&#xD;
Ere Mrs. Coleman reached home she saw 'her husband&#xD;
upon the pavement; he called to ~he driver, and entered the&#xD;
vehicle, fqr as soon as he looked toward it, Diana leaned&#xD;
forward with a friendly nod of, invitation. She intimated&#xD;
no remembrance of her displeased manner at the dinner&#xD;
table but laying her hand in his, said archly, "I am glad to&#xD;
see you !"&#xD;
He smiled and lifted the hand to his lips. After a little&#xD;
chat upon the fineness of the weather, he asked, "Where&#xD;
have you been ?"&#xD;
"I have been taking a drive with Amy; we went on the&#xD;
Harlem road."&#xD;
He looked at her quickly and suspiciously. "I think you&#xD;
told me Miss Leonard lived in that direction ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"She does !" dreading his anger, she added, "I haven't&#xD;
been near her." This was literal truth, but it was not can-&#xD;
dor, and Diana blushed. Her husband observed that she&#xD;
rather averted her eyes from him.&#xD;
Not many days after, a little note was laid upoW Mrs.&#xD;
Coleman's table* it was from Agnes, and expressed a&#xD;
simple and affectionate regret that she had not been at home&#xD;
the day she called; she hoped for the pleasure of meeting&#xD;
her soon. When George entered the room at twilight, he&#xD;
saw the billet; supposing it a mere note of invitation he&#xD;
carelessly opened it; after reading it, he thrust it angrily in&#xD;
his pocket, with the intention of presenting it to his wife,&#xD;
who was out upon a shc)pping expedition. A friend&#xD;
accompanied her home to tea, so that nothing cottld be said&#xD;
upon the subject. It was about eight o'clock when they&#xD;
'~ crc left alone. Diana's first exclamation was, "Now I&#xD;
must dress for the party in hot haste. Will you be ready,&#xD;
George ~"&#xD;
"No !" was the brief answer.&#xD;
"Why ?" she quickly asked.&#xD;
"I prefer to stay at home." his cold peremptory man-&#xD;
ncr, which Diana thought entirely uncalled for, aroused all&#xD;
her haughtiness. " I don't 1" she rejoined, going toward the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"1 shall not consent to your going alone."&#xD;
"I did not ask your consent." She regarded him de-&#xD;

"You will retain my love and respect QUly by obedience,&#xD;
Diana."&#xD;
"I have no wish to retain the love of a despot." She left&#xD;
the room and closed the door after her in haste.. Swift&#xD;
thoughts ran in this wise through her mind as she ascended&#xD;
to her dressing-room: "lie linows that I must have some-&#xD;
thing to pursue, or I shall die. I'll fling all his restraints a&#xD;
thousand leagues away. I'll go to parties whenever I&#xD;
choose. I'll visit Agnes to-morrow. I'll write for publica-&#xD;
tion. I'll flirt to the end of my days. I wont be dictated&#xD;
to. I wfll have my freedom. My own father and mother&#xD;
studied my happiness, and never thwarted me; George&#xD;
promised a thousand times more love when he lured me into&#xD;
this matrimonial trap. I was a credulous fool to pass under&#xD;
the yoke." Arrived in her room she rang the bell vehe-&#xD;
mently, and ordered the carriage to be ready in half an hour.&#xD;
When she was dressed she went down into the parlor under&#xD;
the pretext of getting her fan, but in reality to show her&#xD;
husband that she was going, so that he might j~in her if he&#xD;
ch )se.&#xD;
"Diana !" he sternly called,' handing her Agnes' note.&#xD;
A bright scarlet flew to her cheeks, but she looked di-&#xD;
rectly at him, saying, "'Very well r'&#xD;
"J thought you told rue you 'had n~t been to see her."&#xD;
"I said I had not l5een near her, which was perfectly&#xD;
true, because she was not at home."&#xD;
"You deceived me&#xD;
&#xD;
"Perhaps so~ Tyranny is an effectual agent in making a&#xD;
wife secretive, and injustice is the best means of keeping&#xD;
her so. You sealed my lips, 'and treated me like a child.&#xD;
I have the right to be listened to as an equal. You forbid&#xD;
mc to amuse myself at home as I wish; you object tomy&#xD;
going abPoad; you forbid my approach to a dear friend."&#xD;
"My wife must permit me to judge of the safety of h~r&#xD;
reputation. If she associate with a married man's para-&#xD;
mour, she must disconnect her name from mine."&#xD;
The hint contained in these last words, struck deeply into&#xD;
Diana's proud spirit. "We can discuss this matter when I&#xD;
have more time," she said with forced calmness.&#xD;
lie gave her a look that bade her be silent; as she&#xD;
turned toward the door, he menaced in a voice deep with&#xD;
passion, "If you go out to-night, Diana, you go against my&#xD;
express request."&#xD;
"Very probable !" ' Her voice was low, distinct, and&#xD;
defiant, although her heart shook and seemed to send&#xD;
through her limbs a tremulous chill; she left him and went&#xD;
to the party. "Come for me at eleven, Tom," she said,&#xD;
looking back from the doorstep of a brilliantly lighted&#xD;
house.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was a sunny June afternoon when Amy made her second&#xD;
attempt to see Agnes Leonard. As she went up the path&#xD;
that led to her door, her friend saw her from the window,&#xD;
and hurried to meet her; in a moment they were in each&#xD;
other's arms, exchanging tenderest greetings. The little&#xD;
home into which the visitor was ushered, was tasteful and&#xD;
modest. After Amy had laid her bonnet upon a chair, the&#xD;
two entered into conversation. Agnes seemed the gentle&#xD;
one of yore: the feverish enthusiasm of the past was not&#xD;
visible in her manner or conversation.&#xD;
"Do you ititeud to associate with those who advocate&#xD;
your views publicly ?" Amy inquired, after they had con-&#xD;
versed with the utmost freedom upon the alienation of&#xD;
friends and acquaintances.&#xD;
"No, not much. I shall seek my happiness at home. I&#xD;
find there are not many who could safely take the step that&#xD;
we have taken; there are a few however."&#xD;
"Then you cannot think as you did, that the world is in&#xD;
a state to act upon your principles?"&#xD;
"I have changed in this respect: there is so much yile-&#xD;

ness in the world, liberty cannot be granted to all to follow&#xD;
out their impulses. I rejoice every day that Mi'. Ashley&#xD;
and I came together; I think he has grown a better man&#xD;
under my influence.&#xD;
"It may be." Amy dropped her eyes musingly to the&#xD;
floor; lifting them, she added, " I think you must morally&#xD;
have retrograde to be able to meet him on his own ground;&#xD;
you will let me say so, Agnes, I can't help thinking it."&#xD;
Yes, I can bear to hear your sincere thoughts, however&#xD;
much they may wound me."&#xD;
Amy's eyes filled with tears, and she forbore further&#xD;
remark, save that she said, "I think that you will have&#xD;
courage to forsake Mr. Ashley, if you ever realize that~ your&#xD;
course is sinful." Each seemed anxious to be forbearing,&#xD;
and to avoid useless arguments. It was a sad, sweet after-&#xD;
noon ; Amy had something to tell of the little grey years&#xD;
that had glided into eternity each looked back yearningly&#xD;
tox~rard the season when their affection glowed in its primal&#xD;
warmth.&#xD;
About five o'clock Mr. Ashley came home. Amy was a&#xD;
little embarrassed a~ the meeting; the last time she beheld&#xD;
him, he was surrounded by his family. lie entered into an&#xD;
elaborate conversation on the pleasures of school-teaching;&#xD;
upon which subject his visitor was happily at home., The&#xD;
worshipping love of Agnes was visible in every look 4nd&#xD;
tone ; the manner of Mr. Ashley was also unrestrainedly&#xD;
affectionate, yet, it seemed as if he exulted iii showing&#xD;
his unlimited power over the gifted woman who had&#xD;

&#xD;
sacrificed so much for him. / She passed by him as he stood&#xD;
leaning on the mantel ; he clasped his arm around her&#xD;
cn~ressingly ; the soul Qf Amy recoiled at th6 sight of this,&#xD;
for she felt that ther~ never had sounded through the&#xD;
depths of his nature a voice that said, "Be pure, as God&#xD;
is pure !"&#xD;
The arrival of an upholsterer called Agnes from the room.&#xD;
"Don't go until I come back," she said to Amy, seeing that&#xD;
she laid her hand upon her bonnet.&#xD;
When they were alone, Mr. Ashley immediately threw&#xD;
aside his formal manner, and said. " Amy, doubtless it&#xD;
seems strange to you that Agnes and I live as we do; ~ve en-&#xD;
countered many persons in Europe who were living in the&#xD;
same way. . I have enjoyed more rest and happiness in the&#xD;
last two years than in the previous twenty. I have made&#xD;
up my mind that I will not sacrifice my peace and comfort&#xD;
to, the world's opinions I did that too long. You can have&#xD;
no, idea of the intolerable life I led with Mrs. Ashley."&#xD;
A feeling of kindness touched his listener's heart, for she&#xD;
knew too w~ell that his married life had been miserable. She&#xD;
answered, "I do not care much -for the world's opin ion&#xD;
in this matter, but I think you are not acting rightly."&#xD;
Mr. Ashley bowed gravely, without arguing the point at&#xD;
large he proceeded, "This attachment has elevated my&#xD;
spiritual nature."&#xD;
"It seems, to me,1' returned Amy, "that our spiritual&#xD;
natures become elevated when we overcome an affection&#xD;
which is not legitimate; if we do so, we shall fiud ourselves&#xD;
&#xD;
largely capable of loving when we enter the future life, for&#xD;
we shall be more akin to God.&#xD;
Again Mr. Ashley bowed. "Very few people love with&#xD;
all their capabilities. Those who do, know that the affection&#xD;
is God-given, and they feel that it should triumph over&#xD;
all other considerations."&#xD;
Amy believed that this deification of individual desire&#xD;
wa~ opposed to the spirit of him who taught self-sacrifice in&#xD;
his life on earth; but she made no answer. Mi'. Ashley&#xD;
went on. " If I had not lived with Agnes, J should have&#xD;
separated from Mrs. Ashley. I should have taken up my&#xD;
residence abroad, where I should probably have entered it~to&#xD;
some dissipation, for you know a man cannot live alone."&#xD;
This was the man whom Agnes thought noble, god-like,&#xD;
and pure the man who cared for no woman~s ministry&#xD;
save her's; the m~in who held higher views of woman than&#xD;
any other whom she had ever met. Any thought of the&#xD;
pale horror that would have over spread her countenance&#xD;
had she. heard the remark ; she distinctly recalled words on&#xD;
the part of Agnes, which proved that Mr. Ashley had built&#xD;
up her reverence for him by telling untruths. Verily, Love,&#xD;
thou art terrible in thy deceits ; Amy had no more to say;&#xD;
it had been made plain to her, that little actual improvement&#xD;
had accrued to Mr. Ashley from his association with her&#xD;
friend. She did not care to repeat to her the observation&#xD;
that would have touched her so deeply ; she knew that in a&#xD;
few hours she would convince herself that there had been&#xD;
some misapprehension. She was docile to her lover's&#xD;

influence, which permeated her whole spirit. As soon as&#xD;
Agnes returned to the apartment, Amy took her leave.&#xD;
After partaking of tea, Mr. Ashley and Agnes returned to&#xD;
their little parlor. Twilight had slowly dropt down from&#xD;
the day; Agnes sat down by the window; her companion&#xD;
joined her.&#xD;
"hay e you received no answer from Mrs. Ashley yet,&#xD;
Clinton ?" she questioned.&#xD;
" No! she torments me purposely with suspense."&#xD;
"Will it embarrass you very much if she will not consent&#xD;
to selling the lots r'&#xD;
"Desperately! and she suspects it."&#xD;
"I' wish it were SO that my property could be transferred&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
"1 wish it were, so that I could prove to, your proud rela-&#xD;
tives that I would meet pecuniary ruin, rather than lay my&#xD;
hand upon it"&#xD;
".1 met MIrs. Ashley on the ~ti'eet, this morning, Clinton."&#xD;
"Ha! how did she appear?"&#xD;
"Sh&amp;amp;~l~ anced at me with scorn and hate; she looked as&#xD;
if she feared contamination from the rustle of my dress."&#xD;
"Of course! of course !"&#xD;
As they talked, a note was handed in to Mr. Ashley,&#xD;
which ran as follows&#xD;
"SIR :-.--I shall be accessible to no requests from you, until&#xD;
you have separated from the woman whom you live with.&#xD;
"AMABEL ASHLEY."&#xD;
&#xD;
431&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then I am ruined! Then my honorable name as a mer-&#xD;
chant is stained beyond redemption I" sighed Mr. Ashley.&#xD;
"Mv note wilt be protested in two weeks: it will be im-&#xD;
possible for me to raise the money I require except by the&#xD;
sale of those lots." Tie laid the letter upon Agnes' knee,&#xD;
and buried his face in his hands; the deepening twilight&#xD;
scarcely permitted her to read the words, yet she distinguish-&#xD;
ed them; the same twilight concealed the pallor that over-&#xD;
spread her countenance; she needed not a moment's thoi~ght&#xD;
to mature her purpose. "Clinton," she said tremulously,&#xD;
laying her hand upon his bowed head, "We must separate-&#xD;
you have received unmerited opprobrium on account of&#xD;
your affection fot~me. I will not stand in the way of your&#xD;
mercantile credit."&#xD;
"Oh hush, darling," he passionately uttered, folding her&#xD;
t@ his heart. "I cannot live without you. That inflexible&#xD;
woman must. relent-the property is wholly mine; I ask&#xD;
only h~r signature to the deed of sale. It will require hut&#xD;
half its amount to relieve me from all embarrassment; I will&#xD;
give her the rest if she will consent." He started to his feet&#xD;
with some animation saying, " I'll write to her this moment,&#xD;
and make her the offer." After the communication was dis-&#xD;
patched, the writer took his fori~er seat, aud pillowed his fair&#xD;
companion's head upon his breast. She did not give utter-&#xD;
ance to the woe that was breaking over her spirit-she saw&#xD;
the dread handwriting on the wall, and it prophesied evil to&#xD;
come. Her lover murmured, "You are the noblest of wo-&#xD;
men, Agnes."&#xD;

~C Do you think she will consent ?" she painfully breathed.&#xD;
"0, 1 think so," he replied, soothingly. "You must re-&#xD;
member, my (lear, that all people are actuated by selfish&#xD;
motives; she is extravagant, and her revenge will probably&#xD;
yield to her pecuniary interest. Would to heaven we could&#xD;
fly to some sweet Paradise, where her power over us would&#xD;
be at an end."&#xD;
"0, that we could !" she moaned. "If she accept your&#xD;
offer, Clinton, shall we not bury ourselves in a foreign coun-&#xD;
try, after yoiAr business is settled ?"&#xD;
"There are two sides to this case, love. When I meet&#xD;
coolness from old friends, or when anything occurs to make&#xD;
~xie regret that our union is not sanctioned by law, I would&#xD;
fain live in seclusion: but I have found that a man must be&#xD;
engaged in active pursuits to be happy: after a while a&#xD;
little Paradise would become a bore, if I could not* work&#xD;
like other men."&#xD;
"You are not as well as you used to be, Clinton. If we&#xD;
were to go to some island of the Mediterranean, you could&#xD;
go to Paris and transact business sometimes, as you did&#xD;
when we were in Europe before."&#xD;
"We'll think about it," he returned caressingly.&#xD;

When Mrs. Ashley returned from the walk in which she&#xD;
had encountered her husband's favoi'ite, all the worst pas-&#xD;
sions of her soul were stirring: with eager step she sought&#xD;
the seclusion of her room: throwing her bonnet upon the&#xD;

bed, she sat down by it, and hid her face for a moment in the&#xD;
white counterpane. "Oh !" she ejaculated, "I could serve&#xD;
Satan many years, if he ~rould give me power to trample&#xD;
~ their hateful heads in the dust. The wretch! she looked&#xD;
at me with her eternal calmness and self-possession, as if s~e&#xD;
bore herself above me still." She raised her hand. "My&#xD;
signature! it shall cost him a price! I will harass him with&#xD;
care! I will make him repudiate her! if the scratch of my&#xD;
pen will save him from ruin, I will not make it unless he&#xD;
sends her from the country, and return to this house. He&#xD;
will receive my note this evening; I shall know hi a day or&#xD;
two how severe his strait is, and how heavy the rod thatl can&#xD;
hold over him. Wealth and luxury I prize, but I prize re-&#xD;
venge more. They have not cared for me, they have shown&#xD;
me no mercy~; the deyil they have made shall rend them.&#xD;
0, my God! am I the trusting girl that stood beside him&#xD;
twenty years ago? he vowed to love me! we had not jeen&#xD;
wedded two years before he looked flatteringly upon every&#xD;
young female face, and thought it fairer than mine." The&#xD;
memory of the unhappy woman went back to the summer&#xD;
morning of her youth; she had then looked forth with laugh-&#xD;
ing heart upon the future.&#xD;
The evening came, and Icirought with it her husband's&#xD;
reply to her communication. A look of gratification passed&#xD;
over her face after she had read it. She had sent back an an-&#xD;
swer containing the precise words of her former letter. For&#xD;
days Mr. Ashley strove to gain his object, but without sue-&#xD;
c~ss.; his aiixiety of mind told upon his health: seeing this,&#xD;

Agnes strove to conceal the unutterable anguish that preyed&#xD;
upon hei', and insisted that they should part for a time, at&#xD;
least, until the disquietudes of business had passed away,&#xD;
and fortune iwas more propitious. "We can write to each&#xD;
other," she said, "and perhaps we can see each other occa-&#xD;
sional ly."&#xD;
Mrs. Ashley sat in the back parlor, reading, late one after.&#xD;
noon: there was a ring at the do6r-bell, and suddenly her&#xD;
husband stood before her; she grew perfectly white with&#xD;
agitation, although she was not, gi~eatly surprised: she had&#xD;
thought that by a personal interview he might seek to change&#xD;
her purpose. He stated th~tt their children would be ~eft&#xD;
nearly penniless, if she persisted in her present course, 4d&#xD;
uro~ed her for their sakes to listen to reason.&#xD;
She answered, "It depends upon you, sir, to see that they&#xD;
are not penniless. I have nothing to do with it. You have&#xD;
cast upon them the shame with which you have covered&#xD;
yourself; bring them to poverty if you will ; it will be a&#xD;
lighter wrong."&#xD;
Yielding to extremity, he reined his anger, and said, mild-&#xD;
ly, "Sign the paper, Amabel1 and I will separate from&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"That is not all," she coldly said. "The ocean must roll&#xD;
between her and me. You must return to your family, and&#xD;
appear as my husband before the world-before the world&#xD;
only, mark you! You and I will exchange few words&#xD;
thoughwe live under the same roof."&#xD;
He was hardly prepared for this. After some converse.&#xD;
&#xD;
tion, he answered, smoothly, "I agree to your proposition,&#xD;
A mabel."&#xD;
"These things must be done ere I sign the paper. My&#xD;
brother will go on board the vessel to bring me proof that&#xD;
the woman sets sail. You will come here to reside, and&#xD;
appear with me at the opera, and at church: after this is&#xD;
done I will sign The deed."&#xD;
11cr husband bowed, replying, "~ All this shall take place&#xD;
within one week."&#xD;
*      *      *       *      *&#xD;
And within one week all this was don~ Agnes Leonard&#xD;
was on her lonely way to Europe. Mr. Ashley was within his&#xD;
old home, showing that upon emergency the spirituality of&#xD;
his love did not prevent his returning to the " false life"&#xD;
which he and Agnes had pronounced so culpable. Two years&#xD;
before she had condemned in unmeasured terms unhappy&#xD;
pairs who "lived a lie" in remaining together. He did not&#xD;
cease to be her derni-god though he had proved recreant&#xD;
in this respect to his free-love principles ; he had resigned&#xD;
spontaneity of action for a life o~' outward deception and&#xD;
Coere oil. She had pronounced herself a martyr to God's&#xD;
truth when she had ultimate before men her belief that she&#xD;
was Mr. Ashley's true, ~nd only wife; she had braced her-&#xD;
self in her position, by asserting that it would be wrong&#xD;
and criminal in him to bear the legal character of Mrs.&#xD;
Ashley's husband. It was in the mind of the lovers to&#xD;

A SMALL group was gathered at the hour of sunset in the&#xD;
drawing room of Mrs. Tlarriugton; it consisted of Mrs.&#xD;
Harrington, Mrs. Kendrick, and Amy Denbrook: the~ ]at-&#xD;
ter had just entered.&#xD;
"I feared you were not corning !" cried the elder lady,&#xD;
as she assisted in divesting her of her m~ntilla. " Mrs&#xD;
Kendrick and I have been talking as fast as we could for&#xD;
two hours."&#xD;
"I was obliged to go home," said Amy. "An unfortunate&#xD;
young lady spilled some blue pailTit on my dress; I could&#xD;
not come directly from school, as you bade me."&#xD;
"You have not heard the news, Amy ?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Ilarrington, as soon as they were quietly seated.&#xD;
No"&#xD;
"Agnes and ~ Ashley have separated. He has re~&#xD;
turned to his family, and she has gone abroad."&#xD;
Gone?" repeated Amy, with a sensation of surprise&#xD;
and thankfulness "I believed she was capable of sacri-&#xD;
ficing her happiness to 'a~ sense of right." Ere she had&#xD;
finished pronouncing the words, an infinite, compassk~nate&#xD;
tenderness swept away her thanksgiving.&#xD;

You mistake, dear. From the little J can leari~, it&#xD;
seems to be only an ar~ifi~e resorted to, to obtain Mrs.&#xD;
Ashley's signature to some important papers. Poor&#xD;
Agnes ! I never saw such woe depicted on a human&#xD;
countenance."&#xD;
"Then yQU have seen her ?"&#xD;
"Yes ! When Marcus told me she was going, I&#xD;
persuaded my husband to let me visit her. When I&#xD;
entered the room where she wa , she laid her anguish-~&#xD;
stricken face upon my~breast, and ept as if her heart were&#xD;
breaking. She said but little, m king no complaint, and'&#xD;
seeking only to vindicate and exal M~'. Ashley's character&#xD;
in my eyes. She said that it wa she who insisted upon&#xD;
a temporary separation."&#xD;
Certainly !" returned Amy xvi h glowing cheeks, " what&#xD;
woman of delicacy would not suggest ~a separation, if it&#xD;
were shown her that she were a stumbling block in the&#xD;
path of the man she loved? He was her world, her sun,&#xD;
her single joy, for which she bartered all things else, and&#xD;
he has banished her. This is man's love !" The young&#xD;
girl's tremulous lip ~urled. A slight inclination of Mrs.&#xD;
Harrington's head toward the door, caused her to look that&#xD;
way. Mr. Leonard was about entering, and had overheard&#xD;
her words. Ah ! it seemed to hei' as if his love fell over&#xD;
her in a sudden shower of glory: the curve of her lip gave&#xD;
place to a smile of greeting, an&amp;amp; the bitter thoughts that&#xD;
were moving within her, fled as if before the dawn of a new&#xD;
day. Mrs. Hari~ington beckoned him to her side after he&#xD;

~.M.r DENI3RO OK.               429&#xD;
had spoken with Isabel that lady had caught sight of her&#xD;
husband's approach from the window a moment previous.&#xD;
'It ~Tas a perverse satisfaction to Amy, to rise up and walk&#xD;
to the window, at the exact moment that Mr. Leonard sat&#xD;
down near his aunt. She had in times past received many&#xD;
a wound, on account of the disparity between her social&#xD;
position and that of Mr. Second ; she had heard it insinuated&#xD;
in her very presence, that she had entrapped him thi~&#xD;
experience was remembered, and perhaps colored her&#xD;
d~ineanor toward Mr. Leonard.&#xD;
"Please give me a little sewing from your reticule, Bel !"&#xD;
she said, then turning to Mrs. Ilarrington, "Isabel always&#xD;
cuts out, and arranges my work, so that I need not trouble&#xD;
my tired brain with it When I come home from school."&#xD;
"I oive her my own work to do, half the time !" return-&#xD;
ed Bel, laughing.&#xD;
The party was joined by Mr. Ilarrington, ai~d Dr. Ken.&#xD;
drick.&#xD;
"You have heard of' Mary l3ryne's death, of course, sir ?"&#xD;
Miss Deubrook said, taking a seat not very distant from&#xD;
Mr. Leonard.&#xD;
"I have," he, responded. "I am glad to find Dr. Ken..&#xD;
rick's skill has restored her husband to health."&#xD;
Little May came running into the room with light, noise-&#xD;
less footfalls; either really, or pretendedl~ abashed, she hid&#xD;
her face upon her father's knee in profound silence for three&#xD;
minutes: he quietly stroked her hair without making any&#xD;

reference to her. She raised her head at length, and looked&#xD;
around observantly upon every face in the room.&#xD;
"I know you !" she whispered, pointing her finger toward&#xD;
Amy. "I hurt you, one day, but I was in fun."&#xD;
"Ask the lady if she ~s in earnest when she hurts&#xD;
people ?" her father said, looking at Amy with a half smile.&#xD;
"Are you ?" propounded May, going to her, and leaning&#xD;
upon her knee with one elbow.&#xD;
"I can't remember," was the response.&#xD;
"Did you ever see this ~" asked the little girl, holding up&#xD;
a locket, which was suspended by a fine gold chain around&#xD;
her neck,.&#xD;
"No. Can you open it?'&#xD;
"Yes 'in, i can open it 4i11 myself. See 1" With her&#xD;
tiny thumb nail she pressed the spring, and it flew open&#xD;
revealing Sylvia, in the hour of her sweetest bloom: tend or,&#xD;
timid trust beamed from her eyes and smiled upon her lips:&#xD;
it 'was a face that asked protection and fondness. The one&#xD;
who gazed upon, it thought of the love it had inspired; in&#xD;
its dazzle of loveliness she forgot to study its traits of&#xD;
d~aracter. A sense of inferiority passed through her soul;&#xD;
who could ever compare with her in his mind.&#xD;
"She is very beautiful." she said, resigning it to May,&#xD;
who seemed impatient to receive it.&#xD;
"Now let me show you my papa on the other side !"&#xD;
Mr. Leonard's miniature was immediately displayed its&#xD;

for a gaze into all mysteries: deep, strong passions slum-&#xD;
bered in it, but the lips and brow showed that they were&#xD;
atteinpered by conscience and j udginent. After a brief&#xD;
examination, Amy hastily .glanced at Sylvia again ,and&#xD;
closed the locket: no sense of inferiority oppressed her&#xD;
now; she saw by contrast, that the beautiful wife could&#xD;
nevei' have satisfied the highest demands of her husband's&#xD;
nature ; she could not have ascended his spirit's throne like&#xD;
a queen. It had not been unobserved by Mr. Leonard, that&#xD;
the rich carnation deepened in Amy's cheek as she looked at&#xD;
the likenesses, nor that as her glance fell upon his picture, a&#xD;
bashful mist passed over her eyes, as if she were afraid to&#xD;
regard it attentively. Prom this hour the position of the&#xD;
two changed; fear~ and doubt no longer invaded Mr.&#xD;
Leonard's mind, see ~n ing to change the mai~Iy frankness&#xD;
which was natural tK him into edward ice: suddenly, and&#xD;
that quite unexpectedly, Amy found she could not assume a&#xD;
light, itulimereiit, or independent manner; her little wand&#xD;
of power had been transferred to him, silently, but positive-&#xD;
ly. As lie furtively regarded her, she seemed his, his alone&#xD;
-he, believed that God himself had reserved this lovely&#xD;
giUt until chastening and disappointment had diverted his sel-&#xD;
fish ambition into nobler channels: perhaps this flower, ah!&#xD;
how far lovelier than the last, would be given to his keep-&#xD;
ing to become his inspiration: hope winged with all exult-&#xD;
ant glories shone down upon him-a strange thanksgiving&#xD;
broke up to heaven; the greatest joy of his life lay hef~re&#xD;
him-his affections were arousing in their fullest strength.&#xD;

Not caring to draw observation upon himself; he went to&#xD;
Mrs. Kendrick, and asked her if she had read a new work&#xD;
which had been lately issued from the press; they felL into&#xD;
a quiet conversation, yet sometimes the voice of Arnxr&#xD;
reached his ear, thrilling along sweet chords of his life. As&#xD;
she talked to little May, half unconscious of her words, an&#xD;
inf1i~ite attraction drew all her thoughts to him-these&#xD;
thoughts were tinted from the present, and taxed no antici-&#xD;

When Amy returned from school the next afternoon, she&#xD;
found that Isabel had gone to visit an old schoolmate with&#xD;
whom she had kept up a friendship: the half weary teacher&#xD;
went to the bookcase for a volume of poems, that she might&#xD;
read how other hearts sang the hymn of love: A ring at the&#xD;
door bell summoned Mrs. Kendrick's little maid from the&#xD;
kitchen to answer it; supposing it a call for the doctor,&#xD;
Amy looked around, when a person entered the room, clos-&#xD;
ing the door behind him. Mr. Leonard was there! She&#xD;
read all in his countenance; she saw his pale lips that&#xD;
seemed to motion for a smile in vain ; he inclined his head,&#xD;
regarding her with an expression, which burned away all&#xD;
disguise and conventionality: she met it like a startled&#xD;
gazelle, overcome of force; her fair hands, slightly clasped,&#xD;
fell before her; an unsteady rose flitted to her cheek, and a&#xD;
soft, sweet fire appeared in her alarmed eyes, which were&#xD;
mao'netized to his as he approached her: then her lids slow-&#xD;
ly shut down, as if ufider his look. She turned toward the&#xD;
&#xD;
bookcase and laid her hand upon a volume, as if it might&#xD;
protect her from hearing that which must sluke hei~ heart:&#xD;
her hand was captured with a light, reverent touch..&#xD;
Amy !"&#xD;
1-Ici' head drooped a little forward. "Not now," she&#xD;
breathed, within att&amp;amp;~npt to leave him.&#xD;
"Aye, now !" he answered, "noW! my life swings On&#xD;
the n6w."&#xD;
lATith swift impulse she looked up, to read on his counten~&#xD;
ance the deep passion that broke upon her in his voice; she&#xD;
covered her eyes ~with her unfettered hand; impassioned&#xD;
tears rolled down beneath it. "And you love me ~" she&#xD;
faltered, sinking her chesnut curls upon his shoulder.&#xD;
life made no answer, save that he pressed his arm around&#xD;
her with a thrilling, tender movement, and touched with his&#xD;
lips her hair.&#xD;
She withdrew -herself; and he permitted it.&#xD;
"I dare not that you should come so near," trembled&#xD;
from her lips, "until you know my faults and weakness!&#xD;
Do not exalt me beyond the promise of my nature."&#xD;
"N on are human, I know," he took her hand, "but a&#xD;
balsam has dropped upon my eyes, and will translate all the&#xD;
motion of your life to sweetness." He led her to a lounge,&#xD;
where they sat down. Broken thoughts and still more&#xD;
V&#xD;
broken words fell from their tongues, ere the great deep of&#xD;
feeling sunk from tumult into a tren~lous hush; then utter&#xD;
frankiiess seemed open on the part of each to the other;&#xD;
past experiences poured out as simply as if they had been&#xD;

angels of heaven. Amy listened to the story of Sylvia's&#xD;
life, and character, as she might have listened to the story of&#xD;
a gentle sister, lifting her head from his shoulder sometimes,&#xD;
to look with soul-lit eyes and half parted lip into his face.&#xD;
She told how hcr life had gone, with solemn fervor, but&#xD;
when she had finished, quick smiles afternated ~vith blushes,&#xD;
as he kissed her lips, and murmured, "The never~n ore is set&#xD;
upon such a past." They looked back with thankfulness to&#xD;
the paths which they had traveled, but when they looked&#xD;
forward, they gazed far on, until they saw the earthly, melt-&#xD;
big into the heavenly life; they were glad that they had not&#xD;
met in knowledge of each other until God's hand had touch-&#xD;
ed them with chastenir~gs, and had opened within them a&#xD;
perception of spiritual truth and beauty.&#xD;
The deepest twilight had fallen over the room, when Amy&#xD;
heard the click of Dr. L{endrick's night key in the door, and&#xD;
in a moment his voice and Bel's sounded in the hall.&#xD;
"Amy must be up in her room," said Bel. "'Tis dark as&#xD;
Egypt here."&#xD;
"No, Amy is getting a light," returned the young girl.&#xD;
"And has company," followed Mr. Leonard. The next&#xD;
instant the lamp rays fell over the four. It was easy to&#xD;
read the brilliant truth that looked out from the faces of the&#xD;
lovers. Isabel dropped her eyes confusedly, smilingly Dr.&#xD;
Kendrick looked straight at the two with his clear hazel&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Do you give her to me, brother and sister '?~' asked Mr.&#xD;
Leonard with deep irgonation, leading his affianced to the&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX Vi I.&#xD;
AFTER Diana had gone to the party with her husband's&#xD;
Words rankling in her heart, he sat with his forehead ci&#xD;
ped hard upon his palm; the other band was clenched. She&#xD;
defied him to the utmost: she smote upon a propensity that&#xD;
would not bear it; so perchance had he dealt with her-of&#xD;
this he did not think so much : he could not be just while&#xD;
his breast was blistered~ with the memory of her flirtations.&#xD;
The freedom of her manners made him acutely anxious that&#xD;
no gossip should connect itself with her name; he could 'not&#xD;
bear that it should be linked with that of Agnes Leonard.&#xD;
She had let loose upon him all the evil and darkness of his&#xD;
natiwe: entreaty and compromise were not a part of his&#xD;
char\rcter. It was his theory that a wife should be govern~&#xD;
ed b4~ her husband's judgment: he did not in his present&#xD;
mood believe in the melting and moulding process which wo~&#xD;
men use with success when there is a little love, and good&#xD;
material: he thought that the stature of his wife should be&#xD;
made to fit the iron bedstead of his opinions, lie resolved&#xD;
to subdue 'her will completely, once for all; the indignity&#xD;
with which she had treated his wishes, hissed like a hot iron&#xD;
upon his bare soul. The tender flower of conjugal love was&#xD;
&#xD;
rent from his breast and lay at his feet;. perhaps he might&#xD;
choose to pick it up again, but no airs that blow on this side&#xD;
of heaven, could brush the dust from its leaves.&#xD;
When Diana returned home, her heart ~beat to hear his&#xD;
rapid strides across the room; h~ halted~ and leaned upon the&#xD;
mantel when she entered..&#xD;
" Diana !" he said with compelled quietness, "I think you&#xD;
and I havettied the experiment of living together amicably&#xD;
long enough as husband and wife. You may be assured&#xD;
that I will be master in my own house. I will not have my&#xD;
wishes outraged by you, and still forgive. Henceforth, we&#xD;
will meet only at table."&#xD;
Dana bowed her haughty head, and lifted her hand as if&#xD;
to loosen the veil which was tied under her chin. Alas!&#xD;
she could not play out her r6le of indifference: with a wild&#xD;
shriek her hand let go its hold; she fell, as if shot by her&#xD;
executioner. George lifted her and carried her to a sofa;&#xD;
he even pressed his lips with sudden passion to her pale&#xD;
unmoving ones. After he had restored her to full conscious*&#xD;
ness, he left her without any words: perhaps her insensible&#xD;
face prevented him from plunging more deeply into cold re~&#xD;
sentments,* but it did not change ~his purpose: he sought ~au&#xD;
unoccupied room.&#xD;
She sat stricken, gazin~ around upon the ruin of, her&#xD;
idols, but sh~ sat not long .1 her own nature was forgiving-&#xD;
she could not believe he would carry out his cruel purpose,&#xD;
ani banish her front his heart: She rose and went to her&#xD;
chamber, hoping to find him there: with a burst of bitter&#xD;

disappointment, she flung herself in her rich robes upon&#xD;
the bed. For the first time in h~r life, she craved that&#xD;
oruameut of Woman, a "meek' and quiet spirit," not that&#xD;
she might have submitted easily! to tyranny, but that gentle-&#xD;
ness might have made her great in warding off the ills that&#xD;
encompassed her-through her faults her husband's. had&#xD;
sprung hydra-headed into action-~with her self-reproaches'&#xD;
alternated a sense of being unmercifully treated; she felt a&#xD;
mad desire that he should see herein he was cruel and un-&#xD;
generous-she could riot go to him and show him this, for&#xD;
he would not listen. He did not ask reason, or clear-sight-&#xD;
edness from her, only submission such as dumb beasts&#xD;
yield; she had influenced him much, and in many ways,&#xD;
but now his mind was set to attain one point-her unques-&#xD;
tioning fealty. hiei' high spirit chafed at this, as a prairie-&#xD;
horse springs from th~e bit. All night her mind went up&#xD;
~nd down, amid the theories of Woman's Rights and Free-&#xD;
Luvoism. But she loved him; else, with reckless impetuos-&#xD;
ity she would have left his home that starless night, and&#xD;
sought her father's roof: she said to herself that she dread-.&#xD;
ed the scandal of a gossiping world, but she could not go&#xD;
out with the door of his love shut upon her. Acknowledge-&#xD;
ment she would not make, but she wbuld no~t widen the&#xD;
reach. If he would but lay his hand upon her head, and&#xD;
say, "Diana !" in the voice she loved, she could yet learn&#xD;
the. ways that pleased 'him, and find her home dearer than&#xD;
all the world beside.&#xD;
When at dawn, the miserable sunshine crept into her&#xD;
&#xD;
*4&#xD;
&#xD;
chamber, she was sitting on the bed holding her temples-&#xD;
she had fitinted under the blow of the night b fore, ~he&#xD;
must be stronger now, so she arose, and with unsteady hand&#xD;
commenced laying off her costly garments: she meant to&#xD;
receive with calmness, the anguish which his once fond hand&#xD;
c&amp;amp;uld inflict. When the business ~f her morning toilette~&#xD;
was over, and she stood alone in the center of hem~ desolate&#xD;
chamber, her transient fortitude gave Way, 'and ~he burst&#xD;
into an agony of sobs, flinging away all efforts at restraint&#xD;
-~---forsAkeu she stood, and lifted her eyes to God for corn-'&#xD;
passion. When th&amp;amp; breakfast hour arrived, her face was so&#xD;
ghostly pale and her eyelids so red with weeping, that she&#xD;
did not appear. Mr. Coleman did not usually come home&#xD;
to dinner. At tea time Diana was, aroused from a fitful&#xD;
slumber by a servant; she' hastily smoothed her hair, and&#xD;
donned a little fanciful apron of green 'silk, for she 'was still&#xD;
in her morning wrapper, and went down stairs: with every&#xD;
step her pride increased; sleep had lent a fevered bright-.&#xD;
ness to' her cheek; there were no traces upon her face of&#xD;
the tears she had shed. She ordered the bell to be rung,&#xD;
and waited at a window for her husband. He ca e down,&#xD;
and they seated themselves at the table in silen e: when&#xD;
Diana poured the tea, her husband looked at her with&#xD;
furtive eagerness; he was evi~lently disappoint d in the&#xD;
smooth proud face before him, and set his lip mo e sternly&#xD;
than before. He would have loved her more, ha he seen&#xD;
his power to make her suffer in her aspect. After the&#xD;
evening meal, acquaintances called in. Diana met thorn&#xD;

with lively courtesy, and while they remained, never flinch-&#xD;
ed from wearing smiles, and speaking word~ of jest and&#xD;
commonplace. Gorge xVas gravely polite, lie did not&#xD;
possess this faIlit~ at disguising his feelings, and it angered&#xD;
him that Diana ~vas so light in her g~'ief.&#xD;
When they were left together, she went from the room,&#xD;
quietly, without looking at him. Her chamber was 'dark:&#xD;
she sank down by the window, as if the Supreme could be&#xD;
better found through its pale light, and moaned, " 0, m~r&#xD;
God! how can I live through this ~~retched farce ?"&#xD;
Morning and evening passed away-no word of meekness&#xD;
escaped the wife's lips, no word of concession the husband's.&#xD;
The two were congenial in character, but congeniality will&#xD;
not secure happiness unless a man "leadeth an uncorrupted&#xD;
life, and doeth the thing which is right."&#xD;

Two weeks had passed away since Mr. and Mrs. Coleman&#xD;
had ceased their friendly manner of living-it has been a&#xD;
singular two weeks to Diana; never had sh~ been so calm,&#xD;
and cold, an~1 stately, so unutterably unlike her former self:&#xD;
this outward seeming was like snow upon the mountain top,&#xD;
giving no sign 'of fires that raged beneath. Every day a&#xD;
fierce conflict~ went or~ within hei', and every day it grew&#xD;
more possible to her to contemplate the idea of separating&#xD;
from her husband, and seeking freedom and loving smiles in&#xD;
hey' fathers house. Sometimes the thought of appealing to&#xD;

its mad hearings with a hush. The world had called her&#xD;
self-sustained, heartless, but her heart cried out with all its&#xD;
strer~gth, for the love that was departing; it drooped, wound-&#xD;
ed and panting, under his averted look : it listened to his&#xD;
voice when he conversed with friends, and groaned to know&#xD;
that the treasure of his thought would not be open to her,&#xD;
after they had gone. 'When invitations came, she handed'&#xD;
them to him, saying, with slightly scornful accent, "Shall&#xD;
we go, or stay at home ?" His answers were, "Perhaps we&#xD;
had better," or, " I think n&amp;amp;t." She followed out these hints&#xD;
without c minent. They entered brilliant rooms to-&#xD;
gether, she leaning upon his arm: there, she was the wom-&#xD;
an of 'society, but a little distant and haughty when fine&#xD;
speeches were tendered her. Sometimes she caught a look&#xD;
of interest in her husband's eves that recalled happier days:&#xD;
then her heart beat with a joy as sweet and sudden as&#xD;
when she was a bride. As soon as they were alone each&#xD;
shut the gates of gentle courtesy upon the other, though&#xD;
each had found it pleasant a moment before, to give, and&#xD;
meet a smile. Sometimes, as if to learn whetherr the old&#xD;
kindness had come baek, the ~vife made a remark in a nQt&#xD;
unfriendJy tone. The monosyllable that replied to her,&#xD;
drove her back into a sea of temptation.&#xD;
But a change came, and her really loving heart sprang up&#xD;
with the cry, "Get thee behind me, Satan." Mr. Coleman&#xD;
was seized With a sudden and dangerous fever~: his life&#xD;
swayed to and fro, between. the days; then it was that&#xD;
'she laid aside the proud demeanor which had steeled him to&#xD;

persevere in his coldness toward her-she bent low to hear&#xD;
his feeble words, and answered, in tones that seemed oblivious&#xD;
of his past severity, and melted away all ~the hardness&#xD;
between them. Night and day she ministered to hi r~i,&#xD;
like some sweet saint: often he watched her, as she moved&#xD;
noiselessly about the room, and brightened it with her&#xD;
touches, more quiet than a hireling's; he puzzled hi~ br4ia&#xD;
to comprehend how pity could change a faulty woman into&#xD;
an an~e1 of devotion, lie loved womanlincss, and she was&#xD;
most womanly in her quiet service. One afternoon when&#xD;
he was getting better, she arranged his pillows so that he&#xD;
could sit up: he had not conversed any during his illness.&#xD;
A tender sounding "Diana ?" "I thank you," had been the&#xD;
limit of his talk. She sat beside him and leaned her head&#xD;
upon his pillow, for she was weak and tired.&#xD;
"Poor chiLd !" he said, stroking her hair. "Poor child!&#xD;
You have broken my strong pride-will you forgive inc&#xD;
She hid her face with a quick movement,    With his&#xD;
returning health and former kindness, came the memory of&#xD;
his injustice. His hand lay upon her hand caressingly. But&#xD;
between it and her heart, there rolled two fearful weeks:&#xD;
now that the '~anguish of "hope deferred" and wrestling&#xD;
passion were over-now, that the coveted tenderness was&#xD;
gained, it was not quite the same to her as before; she was&#xD;
not quite willing to glide over the business of the past&#xD;
with a simple, "I forgive." She lifted her head, and said,&#xD;
~n.ana~itated voice," I do forgive, and I crave your forgive-&#xD;

estate, and henceforth your finger must not be laid upon inc&#xD;
in restraint. God never placed an erring creature like my-&#xD;
self ov~r me in judgment. You plunge me into an abyss,&#xD;
and I rise from it a different woman. I have sounded the&#xD;
height and depth, the length and breadth of my forbearance:&#xD;
if you were to draw me before you through the eternities,&#xD;
you would never conquer me. If you cease coercing me,&#xD;
and will use with me only such gentle reasoning and per-&#xD;
suasive arguments as dear friends use with one another, I&#xD;
will stay, and be your wife and companion, but if y~ou set&#xD;
your foot upon my liberty, I will go tG my father's house&#xD;
and leave you. George! I love you still, but I was never&#xD;
made for a captive."&#xD;
lie covered his eyes with his hand as if he had received&#xD;
a blinding blow. " I will think of it," he said. He saw&#xD;
that he had slain some of the sweetness of her love : he had&#xD;
thought that it would all blosomn again for himnif he&#xD;
carressed her and forgave her. A drear dtirkness came&#xD;
about him. Diana comprehended it, and laid her flushed&#xD;
cheek upon the palm that had stroked her hair; her warm&#xD;
tears fell upon it one after another. "I have greatly erred,&#xD;
Diana~ Be patient with inc." This concession from his&#xD;
pale lips went straight to her generous heart ; she knew&#xD;
how much it cost him.&#xD;
"Let us each begin anew," she sobbed.&#xD;

strength of his will against himself. Perhaps there had&#xD;
long slumbered in his heart religi ous aspirations - the&#xD;
seed of the -world h d choked them, he had stood upon, the&#xD;
brimk of death's awful river, and there he had seen himself&#xD;
in a, new light. He- made little reference to the solemn&#xD;
purposes which he formed, but leaning upon God, he held&#xD;
fast to them. His. friends still called him a moral man,&#xD;
-as before: they saw not the new principles which had struck&#xD;
mnto the soul of' his nature. - His wife walked well beside&#xD;
him for a while, but the world was too much for her,&#xD;
and~ she was borne out upon its waves almost imperceptibly.&#xD;
George had been more religiously trained :from -childhood&#xD;
it had not been an unusual thing for him to seek. Divine&#xD;
assistance ; he was one to profit by an exposition of his&#xD;
faults. Wi h returning prosperity angels leaned over him-,&#xD;
and said, " Good cometh out of things evil." Less per-&#xD;
sistent in nature, the idle arid perilous traits of Diana's-&#xD;
character started into full play when affection was removed ;&#xD;
perceiving this in her thoughtful hours, she threw the blame&#xD;
upon circumstances, sighing, "1 might have been different if&#xD;
George's hardness during that fatal two weeks had not&#xD;
changed my love into a fitful flame, and laid me open to a&#xD;
desire for others' interest." When in 'her husband's coun-&#xD;
tenance she read a sudden uneasiness, marked the self-&#xD;
control that withheld his former severity, a tide of self-re--&#xD;
proach rushed over her, and for days she was all tenderness.&#xD;
'To a man of his peculiar disposition she was an acute trial;&#xD;
her faults struck bare across his proud quivering heart. He&#xD;
&#xD;
often wondered, as all tempted souls wonder, why&#xD;
disquietudes which his manlinless e-ould better bear had not&#xD;
been given himi-, but God saw more wisely than he, and&#xD;
knew that a meek saintly woman would. have: fastened his&#xD;
prime fault by her unquestioning allegiance. Such an one&#xD;
would have ensured him a more easy life on earth, but the&#xD;
wounds that Diana gave him, like the strokes of a sculptor's&#xD;
chisel, fashioned him into a more symmetrical man for the&#xD;
life to come. She who had ever been so sweet and genial to&#xD;
the female friends she loved, and to little children, had ever&#xD;
held out a crown of thorns to men who had settled their&#xD;
best hopes upon her.&#xD;

Amy sat down by her chamber window, and threw up the&#xD;
sash that she might better catch the air, and see the purple&#xD;
grapes that nestled in green and gold upon the autumn vine.&#xD;
She looked np with a soft slow smile, into the heaven&#xD;
that arched itself SO t~ndei.lxr above her. She smiled to&#xD;
think how sweet it was to find her heaven on earth-she&#xD;
smiled to think that an infant angel had lately come from&#xD;
God, to live in the house after shie should have gone to&#xD;
travel in storied lands with her husband. Isabel lay in the&#xD;
room below, with her pale hands clasped, though she slept;&#xD;
two weeks before, her baby ha~ been laid upon her breast&#xD;
since then it had seemed holy ground, arid involuntarily, her&#xD;
hands had folded themselves over it in prayer ere she&#xD;
slept.&#xD;
Amy had named the first morning of the year as her&#xD;
marriage day. When she came from school every day she&#xD;
loved to busy her fingers with something that she should&#xD;
wear as L eo~rard'~ wife: A linen travelling collar which&#xD;

it now; one han~1 was tangled amid the ringlets which she&#xD;
pushed back from her snowy temple, as she leaned forward&#xD;
and looked into the blue above: some few, fair pictures of&#xD;
the earth she had seen, but they had not touched her heart&#xD;
as did the simple sky : this was not strange, for now, no&#xD;
unsatisfied cry broke up to God : the walls of her spirit&#xD;
were hung with pictures that could answer back to outward&#xD;
nature. intelligently: the beauty of wooded shore, deep&#xD;
river, and ethereal hills had saluted her with varying&#xD;
force-they had even seemed like semblances of an inner&#xD;
world to which she had no key. She had said to herself,&#xD;
Patience, patience, I slicdl find the key, and the glory."&#xD;
Ihe time had come, and she extracted hope from everything.&#xD;
The sapphire of the spiritual heaven seemed to gleam&#xD;
through the material, and shine round about her. Her&#xD;
most passionate dreams of love were more than fulfilled.&#xD;
She sometimes put forth her hand to clasp with faith the&#xD;
duties of actual life, lest God might leave her, ~in her&#xD;
worship of the human her life so thrilled under the&#xD;
prodigal and extraordinary affection which flowed to he~&#xD;
from her lover, that she sometimes wondered if she listened&#xD;
to the speaking of others as she used to do.&#xD;

and kissing her, as he stood before h'er holding her two&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
She saw that he smiled, and a light smile born of his,&#xD;
rippled across her lips. '~You must go ?" she asked, ~ee~&#xD;
lug that he did no~ sit down.&#xD;
"Yes, some news awaits me."&#xD;
She looked up appi~ehensively. "What ~"&#xD;
"That I do not know myself. I was preparing letters&#xD;
for England an hour ago, (one told ~f our apProaching mar-&#xD;
riage,) when I received a note from uncle bidding me hasten&#xD;
home, as business of serious, and exceeding importance&#xD;
might require my presence in Euglan~d immediately."&#xD;
A pale shadow swept over Amy's face, but her eyes&#xD;
were riveted Lo his.&#xD;
"Nay," he said, hiding their j;ainful expression upon his&#xD;
breast, "no ocean shall pass between us two. Will you&#xD;
go with me? In three days ?"&#xD;
"If they say so," she answered, pointing to the next room&#xD;
where Bel lay.&#xD;
"And they will."&#xD;
"It can't ~be about Aghes ?"&#xD;
"0 no, I think not. You ladies always suppose that a&#xD;
serious business 1~s something to do with the affections. I&#xD;
fear a commercial disaster.'7&#xD;
"That would be very bad," she spoke as if she did not&#xD;
appreciate how bad it xvould be; as one might speak of a&#xD;
tire in a distant city. She raised her head, as if an antici-&#xD;
pated storm had passed by.&#xD;
&#xD;
Seeing this, he said, "Amy, Marcus 'Leonard thought&#xD;
himself a rich man this morning; he may find himself a&#xD;
poor one to~~nio'ht To4norrow he may be wrestling with&#xD;
0&#xD;
anxieties."&#xD;
"I may go with hin~ ?" she sank her head upon his&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
"And while he has this sweetest mouth to speak to Idtn&#xD;
he can find no anxieties. The heaven of providence is&#xD;
over us; we can give up some pleasures, if it be God's will."&#xD;
"0 yes !" after a moment she added, "I can hardly be&#xD;
sorry if we must resign our plan of visiting the fairest&#xD;
Edens of the earth; it would he too beautiful for realization.&#xD;
It' we have some cares, I shall not feet that the vision which&#xD;
has dawned over us, will dissolve away in mist." She&#xD;
smiled radiantly-securely.&#xD;
"The days of my. life," he said "blow out like roses upon&#xD;
the tree: they fall away as the petals fall to the earth, filling&#xD;
the air with fragrance; each new day that opens, is drunk&#xD;
with the perfume of the yesterdays. Through all the tu..&#xD;
mult of business, a subtler life of joy penetrates. But I must&#xD;
leave you now. I will be back before ten o'clock, and will&#xD;
then tell you how this news effects us." He left her ~nd&#xD;
went home. As the spell of her blessed presence passed&#xD;
away, he sent out his thought in search of the news that await-&#xD;
ed him: he could think of nothing save that a friend who had&#xD;
engaged in an important enterprise with him, had proved Un-&#xD;
faithful, and sunk the greater part of his fortune. He was&#xD;
no~t living so far above the world that this supposition did not&#xD;

thinking how entirely he and Amy would agree in their use&#xD;

Mr. Leonard had not gone ten paces from the house~, when&#xD;
his betrothed entered her sister's chamber with noiseless&#xD;
hasty step; the young mother was awake.&#xD;
"Why are you not riding ?" she asked.&#xD;
"Possibly business may take Marcus to England very&#xD;
soon," was the t'esponse; she took Bel's hand and stroked&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"Will he be back by the first of January to be married&#xD;
"Perhaps, not. What would you say if I were to go wi ~h&#xD;

A surprised verrniilioi~ struck into Isabel's pale cheeks.&#xD;
"I don't know," she murmured. "The day of parting must&#xD;
come some time."&#xD;
The nurse entered the room, and Amy left it, after kissing&#xD;
her sister, and turning down the coverlet to look at the ba-&#xD;
by. She hastened, to her chamber; her whole being was&#xD;
astir with changeful thoughts; hope hovered above her, and&#xD;
then a ghostly shadow took its place, and breathed, "Think&#xD;
not to outrun fate by i~xaking preparations for this journey."&#xD;
'She opened her trunk and took out of it such articles as she&#xD;
should not require, but suddenly her resolute hand was stray-&#xD;
ed; a darkness overwhelmed her, and the splendors of her&#xD;
life went down in it. She turned partially around like one&#xD;
blind, and groaned," 0, Marcus! ifarcus! the bolt has fal-&#xD;
len !" she lay with her face upon the trunk; her heart was&#xD;
&#xD;
stunned in the waves that surged over her; her breath caine&#xD;
suflbcatinolv. Was it true that her spirit stood so near to&#xD;
his, that she caught the blow which fell upon him !-the&#xD;
iron blow? It was true. A dumb agony seized her. She&#xD;
had received the intimation of woe: the manner of it was&#xD;

reached his room, had torn open a letter and had gathered its&#xD;
contents. It was from his father-in-law, and was worded&#xD;
"My DEAR SON :-" The intelligence which I have to&#xD;
communicate is of the most gratifying and astounding charac-&#xD;

picked up by a sister of charity, and conveyed to a hos-&#xD;
pital. A few weeks ago, the superior of the hospit~U&#xD;
wrote to me, asking if her story were true. I flew&#xD;
with Margaret instantly to Paris, and we bore away the&#xD;
child; she is improving daily, and expresses the most earnest&#xD;
desire to meet her husband and little May. Come to us&#xD;
immediately, dear son, and, the tarrying roses will blossom&#xD;
on Sylvia's cheek again. There are many happy years&#xD;
in store for you! Hasten to 'ifs!&#xD;
"Your father,&#xD;
JAMES STONEHOUsE."&#xD;
In Sylvia's delicate chirography, words were traced-&#xD;
"0, Marcus, my beloved husband, come to me, that I&#xD;
m~iy rest my tired head on your heart.&#xD;
"SYLVIA.~&#xD;
Verily men are not angels. Was he glad that the dead&#xD;
was restored to life? No. It was the hour of night: drops&#xD;
of sweat started upon his forehead: and no angels came and&#xD;
mii~istered unto him. Ah! the difference between Christ!&#xD;
and man. Jesus sweat great drops of blood, because sin&#xD;
shut out his light from his creature. Man groans because&#xD;
his individual joy retreats. Satan took the christian man to&#xD;
the mountain, and tempted him-selfish passions like wild&#xD;
beasts, set upon him. There was no doubt about the right&#xD;
way; he saw it all clearly, but his life clung to his newly&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
risen star! his love! 0, to bear her away from human&#xD;
eyes with him, as if the letter had not come! Did the&#xD;
fierce onslaught of the foe triumph? Did he' who had&#xD;
preached so wisely, turn aside from the narrow way when&#xD;
the flames of temptation went into his Gethsemane, and.&#xD;
scorched him? He fell upon his face, and strove to say,&#xD;
"Thy will be done," but it was midnight in his soul: he&#xD;
went f~rth to bear his cross.&#xD;
She who waited for him, breathed through the hours until&#xD;
he came: the 'hand of the clock pointed five minutes after&#xD;
twelve when her strained ear caught his step upon the side-&#xD;
walk. She admitted him, and they stood fhce to face.&#xD;
"'Tis so," she said reading his countenance, and laying&#xD;
her quivering palms in his. "'Tis so! I knew it."&#xD;
"How ?"&#xD;
"Sot~ciething has parted us." She laid her white face&#xD;
upon his breast, as if for dying there. "I have prayed,"&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
"There is need," he answered, taking her to the lounge,&#xD;
and holding her face against his heart as he did so. They&#xD;
sat quiet-quiet, through an hour. His mute cheek touched&#xD;
hers.&#xD;
"Little Amy !" he softly, slowly uttered, "God has part..&#xD;
ed us."&#xD;
"Sylvia lives."&#xD;
She started back, while a flame ran over her cheek, and&#xD;
glea mied upon her lips in scarlet; *the fire awoke in her dull&#xD;
eyes: it awoke with devouring energy inher dulled heart,&#xD;

to goad it to swift, unflinching sacrifice, she remembered&#xD;
Agnes. Martyrs i~uh to the stake, lest dallying, and look-&#xD;
ing back, with fainting limbs, their souls drop out of heaven.&#xD;
She comprehended her woman's mission-she was his&#xD;
vestal, to give him inspiration, that he might scale celestial&#xD;
heights-not hi~ Circe, to drown his courage by her sed tic-&#xD;
tions. She looked (lown with folded hands. At length,&#xD;
"2Beloved! " she said, with heavenly tenderness. "lie that&#xD;
hath clean hands and a pure heart shall enter there," point-&#xD;
ing upward. " Clean hands and a pure heart."&#xD;
"Aye, clean hands and a pure heart," he repeat6'd.&#xD;
She did not contend with her fate; she heard the voice of&#xD;
the living God within her, and knew that lie could bear her&#xD;
through the hour. She took from her finger the ring which&#xD;
he had given her. "We shall meet in heaven," she said.&#xD;
A spasm passed over his countenance. "Keep it! wear&#xD;
it."&#xD;
She looked on him with her tender, pitying eyes. "A.&#xD;
pure heart," she murmured. "H&amp;amp;~ceforth no signs&#xD;
betWeen us! Henceforth, God and silence."&#xD;
"Keep it! 'tis little !" he moved her hand away steadily,&#xD;
persuasively.&#xD;
"'Tis too much !" she could not say more; his tone so&#xD;
thrilled her, she drooped over the abyss of temptation: she&#xD;
longed to wear the once sacred emblem: she felt that her&#xD;
love for Marcus Leonard sto6d between her and heaven; it&#xD;
occurred to her that Agnes would have been saved from&#xD;
sophistries, if she had repudiated the first temptation: with&#xD;
&#xD;
a wild voiceless appeal to God to save her and Marcus from&#xD;
the very shadow of evil, she withdrew the hand which her&#xD;
lover still held toward her, and flung the ring from the open&#xD;
window: he understood her wholly-her agony of aspire.&#xD;
t~on was translated ~y h~r upraised eyes: it passed into his&#xD;
spirit: he closed the window gently, trei~nbling all the&#xD;
while, and then, drew her head once more to his breast.&#xD;
An exaltation breathed over her. ~" You said, Marcus, that&#xD;
Sylvia told you yQU taught her God was love. She too&#xD;
may meet hours of. self-abnegation. Still teach her! we&#xD;
only faintly apprehend now that God is love, but it is so:&#xD;
tell her so! she is our sister, our little one."&#xD;
"Aye, I hear !"&#xD;
The story of Sylvia's restoration was brokenly told: the&#xD;
clock struck four. Leonard arose: Amy faintly arose also:&#xD;
he kissed her forehead: he reverently kissed her hair; with&#xD;
speechless lips they parted. Then her exaltation left her:&#xD;
her heart seemed withered, at the root: the well of tears&#xD;
was dry: no scanty drops moistened' the fiery desert upon&#xD;
which she had fallen. "0 Christ! 0 God I" panted&#xD;
through her beseeching lips. It were sad to tell how she&#xD;
staggered under the days, combating with consuming pain-&#xD;
sinking, rising-perishing, reviving. It were almost sad to&#xD;
tell how in the hushes of suffering, a spiritual light trembled&#xD;
through, and then-oh despair! was lost. It were not&#xD;
altogether sad to speak of more quiet hours that came&#xD;
when the spirit dared look back, seeing' that God shone&#xD;

down out of his heaven; He had meant well by His&#xD;
descipline--na~, more! He had meant munificently.&#xD;
Six months after the parting, Amy sat again in the&#xD;
parlor; the twilight came down duskily. She x~as no longer&#xD;
a teacher at Mr. Hawks' schol; he had asked the gift of&#xD;
her poor hand, sand she had left him. A week or two after&#xD;
Mr. Leonard's 'departure, Dr. Kendrick had taxed his small&#xD;
means tO rent a piano for Amy, he hoped it would cheer&#xD;
her; it had suggested to her the idea of giving lessons upon&#xD;
it, and now she was a music teacher. It was too late to&#xD;
read; the booK she held was closed upon her finger; it had&#xD;
played thrillingly along the chords of. her heart, working up&#xD;
an irrepressible yearning: its tone mingled with a song&#xD;
which she had heard that day from the lips of a sweet.&#xD;
voiced girl. She went to the piano, and the song flowed in&#xD;
pathos from her tongue:&#xD;
"Oh, that we two were Maying&#xD;
Down the stream of the soft spring breeze,&#xD;
Like children with violets ~playing,&#xD;
In the shade of the whispering trees.&#xD;
Oh, that we two we~'e Maying&#xD;
On the sward of some sheep-trimmed down,&#xD;
Watering the white masts streaming,&#xD;
Over river, and mead, and towa.&#xD;
Oh, that we two lay sleeping&#xD;
In our nest in the ohuroh~yard sod,&#xD;
With our limbs at rust in the quiet earth's breast,&#xD;
And our souls gone home to God."&#xD;
Her hands lay silent on the keys; her soul was drowned&#xD;

xviii rescue me from these sad dreaming. I will hold him&#xD;
against my breast, and he shall be my protecting angel."&#xD;
She left her seat, a~d was going from the room, when the&#xD;
door opened, and Mr. Second stood before her.&#xD;
"Amy !" His voice had the old kindness. She was so&#xD;
startled by his unexpected appearance, tl~at she made no&#xD;
show of courses~ She reached out her hand in silence;&#xD;
sorrow had made~ her tender to every living thing.&#xD;
He held her hand. "Amy, has not the world proved&#xD;
hard ~"&#xD;
"So hard."&#xD;
"Will you reject me now, dear child ?"&#xD;
"Oh, Justin, I must." She dropt her forehead humbly up-&#xD;
on the hand which detained her own. "I am not arrogant&#xD;
any mor~ dear Justin. You are too good-too merciful to&#xD;
rue: but my way lies where yours does not. I could not&#xD;
make you happy." She raised her head, and stood apart.&#xD;
He pleaded as men plead for a great boon. She was still&#xD;
and pale-she was immovable. Two months after thi~, she&#xD;
heard that he had wedded a young fair wife,&#xD;

CHAPTER. XXXIX. .&#xD;
WHEN Marcus Leonard sailed for England, he did not ask,&#xD;
" Why is this ? Why do I suffer ?" lie knew that his&#xD;
human schemes did not accord with the Divine : he had&#xD;
faith in the Creator. Yet a tempest rocked his ship of life&#xD;
until its timbers were strained ; it threatened to go down&#xD;
when it made shocks of advance. How quiet and clear-&#xD;
headed we can seem when we speak to the little ones&#xD;
though within us we see complaints tossed from other&#xD;
passengers, up to heaven. At nightfall, Mr. Leonard sat&#xD;
apart from other~ passengers, and-held his little daughter up-&#xD;
on his Isnee. " We are livig in a fairy .land," he said to&#xD;
~her, "and our Lord is the 'Great Enchanter. If' we keep&#xD;
the rules of his Sacred Book, son'ie day you and I, sweet&#xD;
child, shall be like Cinderella: we shall" feel the touch of&#xD;
the fairy's wand? and shall find ourselves in a world more&#xD;
beautiful- than this." Then little May would look up and&#xD;
ask many, questions: the pure commands, the sweetest&#xD;
balms of Scripture would be dropped into her childish&#xD;
heart-and so they helped each other, the father and child&#xD;
-and she saw not that the hours passed him with their&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
solemn torture. lHe put on hits wedding ring with an&#xD;
appeal that cleaved1 the heavens, and fell at the Father's&#xD;
feet. It was an amulet of power, for upon it, .he saw&#xD;
written his vow to devote himself to Sylvia. When his&#xD;
thoughts turned in anguish upon the drooping blossom he&#xD;
had left behind, he looked upon the circlet, and angels&#xD;
strengthened him. -One can almost at will open the gate&#xD;
of he'aven, and be baptized into a higher life.&#xD;
When Mr. Leonard arrived in England, Mr. Stonehouse&#xD;
mnet him at the wharf. They journeyed to the old man's&#xD;
home together, and he little dreamed that the strong, cheer-&#xD;
full voice to which he listened, the old .kindness of manner,&#xD;
hid a sacrificing, not a happy spirit. They reached their&#xD;
destination: May was radiant with delight. Two women&#xD;
stood upon the piazza, as the carriage rolled up the avenue&#xD;
that led to the house: the younger bounded down the walk&#xD;
to) meet them: her childlike, joyous grace was not to be&#xD;
mistaken. A tender pity moved her husband's heart ; he&#xD;
sprang from the carriage and caught her in his outstretched&#xD;
arms, murmuring, "Mf innocentt lamb!, my 'innocent&#xD;
lamb !" He. felt as if he were wronging her, though he&#xD;
could not help it, when he saw the passion of her love. He&#xD;
lifted her small, slight form in his strong arms, and carried&#xD;
her to the house;- she clung about his neck with both arms.&#xD;
Poor child ! she felt as if all vigor and power were his to&#xD;
give her. Her tears fell in torrents over the sweet face of&#xD;
her child. That evening the husband and wife spent inwtheir&#xD;
room together : she sat upon his knee, and laid the golden&#xD;

ripples of her hair agair~st his brave, good heart. It was&#xD;
seldom absent' from his thought, that he was passing through&#xD;
a spiritual crisis which prayer could turn to victory. Sylvia&#xD;
told her story briefly.&#xD;
"0 Marcus, did you ever think your little Sylvia would&#xD;
languish so long in a public hospital, with her memory&#xD;
gone, and. with her eyes and ears half dulled to outward&#xD;
things by disease? My bed was by a window that opened&#xD;
in the garden. I remember how one morning I heard a&#xD;
thrush singing in a tree, as I lay with my eyes closed. I&#xD;
thought I must be in our home; I put out my arm to feel&#xD;
if you and little May were with me: then I opened my&#xD;
eyes and saw fifty 'narrow whit9 beds ranged side by side in&#xD;
a long room. I raised my head and looked around frighb&#xD;
ened. The doctor and nurse came to me; they spoke&#xD;
in Freiich. He said the same thing over three times,~ or I&#xD;
should not have understood him, "The new treatment has&#xD;
succeeded ! she knows ! she remembers !" 0, 1 did remem-&#xD;
ber, and was bewildered. I told them all about~ myself:&#xD;
they said that they would write to you and father; they&#xD;
said that you would come for me. It seemed a year before&#xD;
my father came.    *    *    *    And you are with&#xD;
me now, dear Marcus, and I shall go no more out of you&#xD;
heart foreVer."&#xD;
'He answered by a tender pressure.&#xD;
They returned to thek former mode 6f life. Fortunately,&#xD;
Mr. Leonard was called upon almost immediately upon his&#xD;
arrival in 'England, by some gentlemen with whom he&#xD;
&#xD;
470&#xD;
&#xD;
471&#xD;
&#xD;
had formerly been associated, to give lectures among the&#xD;
laboring classes. He bent himself to the work with ardor:&#xD;
it was such work as he needed : he inspired the discouraged&#xD;
and weary, with heroic zeal: he experienced' the blessed&#xD;
power that lies in man to help his fellows.&#xD;
Sylvia often languished in a morbid melancholy that&#xD;
sprang from physical causes. his supporting words seemed&#xD;
to come to her when she would 'have died without them ; he&#xD;
was more patient than of old: when writing or reading, he&#xD;
never stopped her talk by an abrupt word, or imperious&#xD;
gesture sometimes when he looked up and saw her wan&#xD;
face, he pushed back his writing materials and held out&#xD;
his hand: a soft light would strike into her face at this, and&#xD;
she would go to him, like the child-wife that she was, and lay&#xD;
her head where she best loved to lay it. The little tender&#xD;
starling! she never knew that he had seen the unknown wom-&#xD;
an of his dreams, and that her lips had said, of her-" She&#xD;
is our sister-~our little one." And ~o the year went by.&#xD;
ChAPTER XL.&#xD;
Ma. ASHLEY lived a second time in his married home; he&#xD;
sat opposite his wife at the table;' he appeared with her at&#xD;
the opera, and at church; he was the suave husband, the&#xD;
patient father. When sometimes Mrs. Ashley saw him&#xD;
leaVe the house, a smile of bitter triumph would curl her&#xD;
lip as she' said&#xD;

"I have succeeded-I have separated them!"&#xD;
lie obtained his ends from her: he escaped the quick-&#xD;
sands of commercial disaster, and saw his business om~e&#xD;
n~ore in 'a prosperous state. Anxiety and disquiet threw him&#xD;
upon a bed of illness after this ; when he rose from it, the&#xD;
cough which had occasionally startled Agnes, had not left&#xD;
him. He had entered his home from selfish motives, and,&#xD;
the desired advantages gained, he did not hesitate to leave&#xD;
it: it was a little thing ~'to him that, he had cajoled his wife.&#xD;
As we have said, he was not an unfeeling, or a cruel man:&#xD;
he was simply weak and unprincipled. Seven weeks after he&#xD;
entered his family, he deserted it again, and sailed for&#xD;
Europe to meet Agnes LeOnard. When she received him&#xD;
did\ she still hold fast the words with which she had begun&#xD;
her career of sophistry ?-" We do nothing in secret which&#xD;
we would not have proclaimed upon the house-tops." Alas!&#xD;
her love ran like fire through her intellect, and gave to her&#xD;
perceptions of false hue. She did not think of her lover's&#xD;
actions except hi the light in which ~he saw them. She&#xD;
deemed it but another proof of the spirituality of their love,&#xD;
that he had found himself unable to live apart from her.&#xD;

xvith Mrs.' Ashley.&#xD;

Two years later, thesunset poured a golden flood over the&#xD;
Mediterranean; the delicately clear waves caught every&#xD;
variation of the sky-its~ dreamy blue, its warm ethereal&#xD;
&#xD;
clouds, that seemed to woo the sopl to glorious hopes. A&#xD;
young woman, robed in white, stood upon the shore of a fair&#xD;
island; she looked through the atmosphere toward an&#xD;
opposite shore, where the distant hills died at last into the&#xD;
glory overhead; beneath them a vermilion glow rested up-&#xD;
on a line of feathery tree-tops; light and shade played over&#xD;
upland slopes, and broke with united. force upon a 'chapel&#xD;
which was set down amid a clump of orange-trees and&#xD;
tropical verdure: the silver chime of bells swayed clearly'&#xD;
over the water, and fell upon the woman s ear.&#xD;
"No vespei~ bells! no vespers bells !" she breathed, un~&#xD;
locking her' hands, and covering her ears, to shut out the&#xD;
sweetness of their voice. She turned around toward her&#xD;
home; this was a cottage and villa united: a trellis partially&#xD;
hid the piazza; over this clambered 'a vine which ran in&#xD;
luxuriance upon the roof' of the house; its gorgeous scarlet&#xD;
flowers drooped in profusion everywhere. Between t~e&#xD;
slender columns of the portico, a man could be seen re-&#xD;
dining upon an easy chair the sunset struck upon one or&#xD;
two marble statues in the harden-the man looked, beyond&#xD;
these, upon the fairy isles that lay upon the sea; 'they were&#xD;
purpling in the departing day, and their shores were mist-&#xD;
like as the clouds above. As the white-robed figure slowly&#xD;
advanced up the path, a nightin~ale poured out a hymn of&#xD;
joy; she looked up, and knitted her sad brow, as if it&#xD;
wounded her.&#xD;
"This 'sunset scene revives me, Agnes," the pale man&#xD;
said, as she approached him.&#xD;

"It's glorious' beauty is a fading flower," her heart an&#xD;
swerved. She sank at his. feet, and hid her mute lips upon&#xD;
his knee. He laid his hand upon her jetty hair.&#xD;
"You did not stray far, love," he said.&#xD;
Far enough, my master ~ my idol !"&#xD;
" Are you weeping, dearest ?"&#xD;
"It does me good."&#xD;
"I am better, dear."&#xD;
Weary with the c~are of the irwalid, soothed by her weep-&#xD;

sleep long, and she awoke, dreaming that evening dews&#xD;
touched the forehead of her beloved. She looked up. if is&#xD;
head had fallen back; his chin ha&amp;amp; dropped; the spirit&#xD;
had flown. A screarn---~a gasp-a motion of her fainting&#xD;
arms toward him, and she sank glidingly to the floor. The&#xD;
sea-breeze played over her prostrate form, and blew with&#xD;
lightsome touch the dead man's hair: the vines waved their&#xD;
shadows to and fro; the nightingale pealed loud, then soft,&#xD;
his rapturous flute. A female domestic came upon the&#xD;
silent figures: the woman caine back to life.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLl.&#xD;
JT was morning! It was morning! Amy paced her room&#xD;
with quiet steps. Pale an~I spiritual she had grow n;as the&#xD;
thoughts that broke over her stayed her in her walk, sh~&#xD;
was a beautiful sight. She trusted Almighty God rejoicing~&#xD;
ly~ She had stood in the shadows of the years, with her&#xD;
sense of youth depressed, and her buoyant nature in abey-&#xD;
ance. Not so now! she had deemed all jubilance go ne for-&#xD;
ever, but a clear, still spring, had burst up from the fiery&#xD;
desert upon which she fell; it taught her a way that led to&#xD;
the uplands of her soul; she found among them the dew of&#xD;
the morning ; a freshness lay upon the heaven within her.&#xD;
Five years had passed away since the parting, and no mes-&#xD;
sage had come from Marcus, nor had any been sent, from&#xD;
her. It gives a cruel heart~wrench to pluck from off the&#xD;
brows the crown of youth, saying, "Not yet." An agony&#xD;
thrills along the years, ere the lips can peacefully say, "The&#xD;
joy ~s but postponed! the dreams, the golden dreams, were&#xD;
true. I stand upon the threshold of my life, waiting-pre-&#xD;
paring. I see' the elysium." Something 'of this had begun&#xD;
to arise within Amy, ere eighteen anguished months of&#xD;
separation had been told into eternity. After that she am&#xD;
pear6d much like her former self. Later, her tweet laugh&#xD;
had tinkled out at little things. She lived at her brothers&#xD;
house a simple music teacher. They who put their glory in&#xD;
fine trappings, turned away from her, for she walked with&#xD;
toil and poverty as she httd done aforetimne. No fashionable&#xD;

ladies touched her hand in greeting, save Diana Coleman&#xD;
and Mrs. Harrington. Dr. ICendrick could never have con~&#xD;
tinted a rich man, had a fortune been left him. As it was,&#xD;
various little disasters had kept him poor, though he was&#xD;
prosperous in his profession; one unfortunate day, hq en-&#xD;
clorsed a large note . for a worthy friend; upon another, he&#xD;
lent several, hundred dollars which he did not immediately&#xD;
require, to a worthless one. Still his life was a pure suc-&#xD;
cess: his chief aim had not been temporal wealth. And so&#xD;
poverty and economy reigned in the house. But it was a&#xD;
happy home nevertheless, for the sweet wife appreciated her&#xD;
husband's motives heartily, and when he was a trifle indis-&#xD;
creet with his money, for he was indiscreet with nothing&#xD;
else, she said of the consequent annoyance, "Providence&#xD;
permits it, dear."&#xD;
Four years after he had left New York, Marcus Leonard&#xD;
had sent to his aunt a paper containing a notice of Sylvia's&#xD;
death. Poor lamb! she was harvested among the angels&#xD;
at last, where she. stood in no one~ s way. her spoken&#xD;
~rords had not been strong, her personal influence had been&#xD;
faint, but the Great Disposer had appointed her her work&#xD;
though she was unconscious of it. 11 r small, slight form&#xD;
stood between two stronger souls, and ade them glorious&#xD;
with sacrifice ; she had given them a enedict~on, andthey&#xD;

door of a. stately, graceful dwelling, and stept upon its&#xD;

She paused upon a terraced slope, and overlooked the bay,&#xD;
with its lighthouse, the distant city, the New Jersey hills,&#xD;
and the landscape at her feet, that was gorgeous in autumnal.&#xD;
glory. A September sun was still high in heaven. Et~er&#xD;
to spend a part of an afternoon in~ reading to Isabel, she&#xD;
descended the steps near which she stood, and pursued&#xD;
a broad, winding path that led to the gate, that she might&#xD;
hasten tothe ferry. In a bosky place, where the~summer-&#xD;
house cast its shadow, -and spring~ bushes and the sweet&#xD;
scented shrub grew thick under an elm, a man stood,,&#xD;
as if waiting for her-expecting her. The sun shone in her&#xD;
face, and she caught but an imperfect glimpse of the figure.&#xD;
Supposing him to be a gentleman of the family who had'&#xD;
frequently paid her compliments in a tone which she did&#xD;
not like, she dropped her glance in involuntary embarrass-&#xD;
rnent, while an unwilling blush hurried to her cheek&#xD;
almost instantly, th~ lifting of her hazel eyes was queenly,&#xD;
and her proud lip set itself against presumption. She did&#xD;
not notice the man.&#xD;
"Amy !" said a low voice.&#xD;
She started, but did not look; she stepped on falteringly-&#xD;
then turning, the swift truth overtook her.&#xD;
She sought to utter "Marcus !,' but the word died fro~n&#xD;
her parted lips, and she swayed like a sapling before a&#xD;
heavy wind, lie reached her, and bore her to the syringa&#xD;
shade, placing her upon a rustic seat: consciousnessleft her&#xD;
for a moment wholly: when it returned., I~is tears were&#xD;

falling upon her forehead hke rain: his blessed face bent&#xD;
above her. He pressed her to his heart with transport,&#xD;
kissing lips and brow and cheek and hair.&#xD;
"Not here!" she at length besought, pushing him gently&#xD;
ba ~k, and striving to rise.&#xD;
"Nay, here!" he ansWered, drawing her down beside.&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"The ground not panteth so for summer rain,&#xD;
As I for one 'soft look of thine."&#xD;
Waking and sleeping I have dreamed of this ecstacy, since&#xD;
~-.-since it ceased to be sin to look toward you: my will&#xD;
was strong, and I stayed in England a year after I was free,&#xD;
that no kind friend should-say, "His baste showed little&#xD;
respect to the memory of Sylvia." But now, n~ow, the&#xD;
prisoning doors are opened.! I ~ee ~y beautiful one, I&#xD;
breathe her life! I have entered my Eden !" his voice fell,&#xD;
and he added, clinging to the soft hand, "I seem to have&#xD;
come forth from my sepulchre by contrast: this world, with&#xD;
you in it, is so warm, so divinely allu}Ang, so fresh! it was&#xD;
a daily miracle that kept me in the path of duty. Next to&#xD;
God, the remembrance of your saintly strength kept me&#xD;
still and steadfast." With tender, tremulous hand, he&#xD;
touched her silken hair.&#xD;
"l'm fading!", she said, looking into his deep eyes sho&#xD;
smiled trustfully, reading in them that an aureole of joy&#xD;
surrounded her.&#xD;
He looked as angels do, who know that "Love is its own&#xD;
great loveliness always." He read her countenance over&#xD;
and over again, as if to gather there the history which her&#xD;
soul had written since the parting; then, shaken with the&#xD;
passion Which swept through him, he rested his forehead on&#xD;
her shoulder.' He, who had seemed - so calm through the&#xD;

She stroked his hair, unused to see men so moved.&#xD;
"Coihe !" she said, "come where the woods are deep and&#xD;
still."&#xD;
They passed behind a hedge of - osage orange, and went&#xD;
down into a dell, where the trees kept silence, and the birds&#xD;
twittered low, "shivering for very joy ;" the uneven&#xD;
hillocks, the mossy roots, sweeps of greensward, the tiny&#xD;
brooklet's edge, were jubilant with flowers.&#xD;
"1 have been here before !" said Amy, pointing to a&#xD;
wreath of withered fern leaves that lay on the ground. "I&#xD;
never dared stay long."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Nature was too sweet and powerful; it set my heart to&#xD;
aching for the summer that~ was lost. I could bear the&#xD;
woodlands' in the spring season, but not in the autumn. I&#xD;
mind me of the first April morning when I came to this&#xD;
spot, after having given a music lesson in yonder house; I&#xD;
came with a little child, and plucked the pure hepaticas with&#xD;
sudden tears that seer~ied to wash away my spiritual blind.&#xD;
iress. I knelt in the Lord's beautiful sunlight, and thanked&#xD;
him !-I thanked Him that He parted us I-I saw that&#xD;
heaven could come nearer to us for the anguish! I saw&#xD;
thit Sylvia was being perfected for the one who was created&#xD;
for her. I saw that all was well: that I should yet rejoice&#xD;
and bless my Creator for the gift of being: I realized that&#xD;
there was boundless light and love to come."&#xD;
"It has come, love, ere -we expected it !" They sat&#xD;
beneath a tree, and talked until the setting sun flung its&#xD;
gorgeous banners on the sky. . Smiling as they observed it&#xD;
through a vista in the trees, they arose to return hoime:&#xD;
they ar&amp;amp;se to return to the everyday life which had become&#xD;

A few months ,. pair were wedded with a new&#xD;
ring. Twenty-seven years lay upon the head of the bride;&#xD;
rich years ha4 been the last ten, through which we have&#xD;
seen her traveling; weaknesses and faults she had laid down&#xD;
beside the road-weaknesses and faults clung to her still.&#xD;
The deepest wealth of her nature gushed forth, when God&#xD;
had struck the rock-for this she smiled up to him, and&#xD;
gave herself childlike into his arms. He had borne her&#xD;
through the wilderness, and looking back, she saw that it&#xD;
blossomed as the rose.&#xD;
The husband and wife set o.ut upon their course of foreign&#xD;
travel; they visited first the island home of;Agnes, and won&#xD;
her willing consent to join them. She cast her lot with&#xD;
them, when after a year, they reared a home of their own.&#xD;
Into her deepest heart, only~ G~d looked. She never&#xD;
sought to guide tremulous feet into the path which her own&#xD;
had taken, in the morning of her youth.&#xD;
Q'e afternoon, when Amy and Agnes sat upon the porti-&#xD;
Co of their Hudson river house, a letter was handed to the&#xD;
former. It was from Diana, whom Mrs. Leonard had not&#xD;
seen since her return from abroad. It read thus&#xD;
"My DEAR AMY: "You say that you want to learn if I am&#xD;
the veritable lady that I used.to be? You are impatient to&#xD;
hear from me. Tleigho! and again I say, height! Where&#xD;
shall I begin? Permit me to say with my usual abandon&#xD;
and courtesy, that I am flourishing in the vicinity of the&#xD;
Mammoth Cave at present. If I could hide~ a way in said&#xD;
cave, and meet nobody wicked, I should be a most exem~&#xD;
&#xD;
plary person. Behold me installed in a hotel, with a ~gay&#xD;
dashing set of friends around me !-wftlftime weighing~ like&#xD;
an incubus Ppon me. George leaves the hotel early every&#xD;
morning, with gun and hunting pouch, and usually returns&#xD;
the same evening. In the interim, I am to be amused. I&#xD;
watch the maid as she tidys my parlor, yawn, go in the pub-&#xD;
lic parlor and impose myself on whomsoever I fin4 there! if&#xD;
it be an interesting young gentleman, I am compelled to do&#xD;
the agreeable-fearing I may forget how. I return to my&#xD;
room; read, dress for luncheon--take a ramble, and then&#xD;
go home to meet my husband. lie lilies to be alone in our&#xD;
room evenings: but I never was made for that, so he reads&#xD;
while I go where I can be edified by somebody. There,&#xD;
Amy, is a true picture of my life. The winters at home are&#xD;
of the same cast. As for George, I know that I have a&#xD;
treasure: he is wonderfully c~ianged : he never attempts to&#xD;
control me except by reasonable argument. I am making&#xD;
an angel of him very fast, but not by being one myself.&#xD;
lie don't expect much from me; he would be disappointed&#xD;
if he did. He looks monstrous grave sometimes, but when&#xD;
I try to behave he smiles with the dear old smile. I'm go-&#xD;
ing to be intellectual-if much learning makes me mad,&#xD;
believe me, there will be method in the madfess.&#xD;
"Dear friend, my thoughts often embrace the past-the&#xD;
early time when girlhood sat so pure upon my soul, ere I&#xD;
had taken the world to be my God, its atmosphere my&#xD;
home. I shudder as I look inward, and see what the furnace&#xD;
of society has left of me? What was I when I viewed the&#xD;
world at a distance! Could I have conquered, think you?&#xD;
Alas! Write me soon, dear Amy. Remember me&#xD;
affectionately to Agnes.&#xD;

As to Mrs CollIns, she lived in a Southern city for awhile&#xD;
under an~ assumed name; in this place she made' the&#xD;
acquaintance of a wealthly elderly gentlernsii of' the Roman&#xD;
Catholic faith; she abjured all her former opinions, and&#xD;
one Sabbath day ~when the old gentleman was present,&#xD;
she was solemnly baptised into the Rornish Church. Not&#xD;
long after, she perjured herself at the same altar, by&#xD;
naming nuptial vows, and giving her hand 'to the man&#xD;
whom she had deceived by a show of zeal and goodness.&#xD;
She was untracked and undiscovered, and lived a life of&#xD;
outward luxury. Did the law of~ retribution fail in her&#xD;
case? Nay! God holds the law in His Almighty hand,&#xD;
and it rules His creation, whether or not human eyes can&#xD;
receive its workings.&#xD;
If over these pages a weary, suffering, spirit bend, let&#xD;
such an one toil on, and compensation will come. Let the&#xD;
anguished eyes take in the sweep of all-dll. Let this life&#xD;
perform its discipline! let the sword strike to the marrow!&#xD;
there is meaning in it for the aspiring. Patience ~ the story&#xD;
of every life can swell to notes of triumph and success. The&#xD;
liosanna can begin on earth, through an atmosphere of&#xD;
trial. It matters little whether the splendor of reward be&#xD;
fully received here, or yonder: it matters to us, that we&#xD;
earn it-that we know it is coming!&#xD;
