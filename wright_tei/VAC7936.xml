TO GEN. S. F. CAREY,&#xD;
The Apostle of Temperance in the West, these un-&#xD;
pretending pages are inscribed. His eloquence and&#xD;
pathos, upon Temperance, are associated with our&#xD;
recollections of early school days. Before he left&#xD;
his Alma Mater, in the morning of life, he espoused&#xD;
the cause, from convictions of duty.; and again&#xD;
and again have we heard the old college hail ring&#xD;
with his eloquent voice upon this measure, then in&#xD;
its infancy, and at a time when very much moral&#xD;
courage was requisite to face the tornado raised&#xD;
by an effort to check the fearful ruin. After cn-&#xD;
tering upon the more active duties of life, he gave&#xD;
much of his time, talents and energy, to the cause,&#xD;
and is now growing gray fighting powerfully and&#xD;
effectually its, battles. May he live to enjoy the&#xD;
plaudits of a redeemed and disenthralled human-&#xD;
ity.                          THE AUTHoR,&#xD;

U                       PREFACE.&#xD;
AN apology might, by some, be deemed neces~&#xD;
sary for throwing before the public a work upon a&#xD;
subject which has already employed the pens of&#xD;
many of the most gifted authors of the age, yet&#xD;
there remains much, very much, to be done before&#xD;
that dreadful incubus, intemperance, is driven from&#xD;
our land,&#xD;
Great ingenuity has been displayed by the poet,&#xD;
as well as the writer of fiction, in portraying in&#xD;
glowing colors this great sin of the day, and still&#xD;
its turbid waves seeni to roll on, desolating the&#xD;
brightest hopes of the human heart, little impeded&#xD;
by the hitherto obstructing barriers,&#xD;
The pulpit may become clamorous upon this&#xD;
subject, and religionists may exhaust their powers,&#xD;
without reaching the fastnesses into which this evil&#xD;
has taken refuge. If' this great reformation shall&#xD;
be effected, it must receive essential and valuable&#xD;
aid from a different direction. The destiny of this&#xD;
moral enterprise is now, to a very great extent, in&#xD;

&#xD;
the hands of lawyersjudges, and politicians; their&#xD;
action involves the fatc of this p1iilai~tb'opic incas-&#xD;
ure; and hence, our characters are judges, mciii-&#xD;
bers of the bar, and politicians. Even a suiperli-&#xD;
cial glance at the springs of society, will teach us&#xD;
that lawyers and politicians not only make and&#xD;
enforce our laws, but manufacture a public senti-&#xD;
ment that sustains or repeals those laws at their&#xD;
1le asure;-&#xD;
Unjust decrees they make, and call them just,&#xD;
And we submit to them-because we must."&#xD;
-and, therefore, th~ necessity of making allies ot&#xD;
that class of men. It would be quite as ~eiisibie to&#xD;
throw across a structure, wtih the view of drying&#xD;
up the deep, wide, and rapid current of the mighty&#xD;
river at the point where it mingles its waters with.&#xD;
and becomes lost in the ocean, instead of cutting&#xD;
off the numerous streams and fountains that lent&#xD;
it power and force, as to attempt to stay the pro-&#xD;
gress of intemperance by moral suasion with the&#xD;
masses. This stream of burning lava that is, as with&#xD;
the besom of destruction, sweeping over the land,&#xD;
must be cut off at its source; and who can deny that&#xD;
the influence of the bar and the bench has ever been&#xD;
one of its main tributaries?&#xD;
In the following pages we have drawn upon the.&#xD;
bench, the bar, and the political arena, for materi-&#xD;
&#xD;
al out of which to weave our web; and though&#xD;
some passages may appear pointed and personal,&#xD;
we disclaim any such intention, but insist that they&#xD;
are leveled at the idiosyncrasy of a class, and not&#xD;
at individuals.&#xD;
A desire to arrest the attention, of the legal pro-&#xD;
fession and politicians, and fix it upon the noble&#xD;
enterprise of staying the tide of moral death that&#xD;
is devastating the best interests of society, has&#xD;
dictated the following work. If it shall fall short&#xD;
of the object of our aim, we shall draw consolation&#xD;
from the conscious integrity of our intentions.&#xD;

"What is the condition of your health and spir-&#xD;
its," said Leblond, as with a careless air, he en-&#xD;
tered the room of Judge Jones.&#xD;
"My spirits are at rather a low ebb," replied the&#xD;
Judge. "I have been retrospecting; ay, and pros-&#xD;
pecting too, since we separated last evening. Con-&#xD;
science, the great regulator of human actions, al-&#xD;
ways troublesome on such occasions, has been do-&#xD;
ing its work. I sought oblivion in balmy sleep,&#xD;
but the god of dreams refused to come to my aid,&#xD;
or to harken to my appeals. Anti to consummate&#xD;
my misery, I've received, this morning, an item of&#xD;
news from a friend and highly respectable member&#xD;
of the bar, in the Northern part of the State, which&#xD;
distresses me beyond measure." Handing the&#xD;
letter to Leblond, he read as follows:&#xD;
"My DEAR JoNEs:-&#xD;
A rumor is afloat here I regret most profoundly.&#xD;
It charges you with having been under the influ-&#xD;
ence of mint julips to such an extent you were&#xD;

10             THE UNJUST JUDGE.                                                  THE UNJUST JUDGE.             II&#xD;
&#xD;
incapable of giving the law correctly in charge to&#xD;
the jury, in the case of the State vs. TTamlin, in&#xD;
consequ~n~e of which, an innocent man has been&#xD;
convicted of murder.&#xD;
Much excitement prevails. I will exert my ut-&#xD;
most influence to allay it. Its effect upon your re-&#xD;
election is to be dreaded.&#xD;
I am, dear sir,&#xD;
Very sincerely yours,&#xD;
A. P. JEWLTT."&#xD;
"This FJamiin~" continued Judge Jones, "was&#xD;
indicted on a charge of having murdered his&#xD;
brothei~. The testimony was xvholly circumstan-&#xD;
tial, but tended to show that tile brother, who was&#xD;
an inmate of the defendant's family, had been pois-&#xD;
oned., Circumstantial testimony, when convincing&#xD;
and irresistible, is at all times more satisfactory&#xD;
than positive. While living witnesses, from inter-&#xD;
ested or malicious motives, may falsify; an unbro-&#xD;
ken chain of circumstances pointing convincingly&#xD;
to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, may be&#xD;
safely relied upon in the most important criminal,&#xD;
as well as civil, cases; but always dangerous when&#xD;
ambiguous or disconnected, and has ever been re-&#xD;
garded by enlightened jurists, with suspicion and&#xD;
distrust. Beating one or two circumstances of&#xD;
doubtful character, there was no evidence of the&#xD;
defendant's guilt. Of the utter groundlessness of&#xD;
the charge, I entertained not even a doubt, and&#xD;
was two or three times, during the trial, upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
eve of requesting the Prosecutor to node pros~jid&#xD;
his indictment, b pt perrriitted the case to progress&#xD;
until the testimo i~y on both sides closed. While&#xD;
counsel were engaged in the argument of the cause&#xD;
to the JUry, I was absent, intending after my re-&#xD;
turn to the bench, to charge the jury that the tes-&#xD;
timony was entirely insufficient upon which to&#xD;
~found a verdict of guilt; and of course, upon my&#xD;
return, I charged the jury; but of that I have only&#xD;
a vague and indistinct recollection. The evidence&#xD;
of guilt, thot~gh slight, involved some of the most&#xD;
intricate and interesting questions known to mcd-&#xD;
ica~l jurisprudence, and very lialSle to be misunder-&#xD;
stood by the jury, without a clear, concise, and ex-&#xD;
plicit charge from the court* yet I am unable to&#xD;
recall a single idea, or even a single sentence, I&#xD;
gave in charge to that jury. All that, however,&#xD;
might have been correcte(l had "Richard been him-&#xD;
self again," before the final adjournment of the&#xD;
court. I could have, upon motion, granted a new&#xD;
trial; but true to the instincts of insanity, I re-&#xD;
mained deaf to all intercession."&#xD;
"Well, Judge, that is rather an unfortunate oc-&#xD;
currence, and you have my prayers that it may&#xD;
never again happen. I suppose, during the argu-&#xD;
ment of the case you were out 'liquoring up.' You&#xD;
must learn to touch modestly upon such occasions"&#xD;
"Oh! it is more than unfortunate," said the&#xD;
Judge; "it is. criminal, highly criminal! had I&#xD;
dealt out the fatal drug which so tragically termi-&#xD;

12             THE UNJUST JUDGE.                                                   THE UNJUST JUDGE.             13&#xD;
&#xD;
nated the life of one of the most brilliant young&#xD;
men in that part of the State, I could not have&#xD;
suffered more from conscious guilt; and as for&#xD;
your admonition, it does not go far enough, I&#xD;
ought not to have, under the circumstances; in-&#xD;
dulged at all. It is the most difficult of all under-&#xD;
'takings for a man, already under the influence of&#xD;
liquor, to moderate, or to keep himself within&#xD;
1)OUflds."&#xD;
Leblond here interrupted the Judge, by remark-&#xD;
ing, that as to the effect it would have upon his&#xD;
re-election, that vvas all fudge-a mere chimera of&#xD;
Jewett's brain-but if adroitly managed, could be&#xD;
made to tell powerfully in his favor-would se-&#xD;
cure his election beyond the possibility of a&#xD;
doubt! " Why," continued he, "rally around&#xD;
your standard those of all parties whose sympa-&#xD;
thies are with the hero of mint julip, and they&#xD;
might as well hope to pluck yonder sun from&#xD;
the heavens, as to attempt your defeat, under any&#xD;
cm~curnstances. Their name is legion, and their&#xD;
influence is beyond conception."&#xD;
"Thqugh defeat,"' said the Judge, "from a&#xD;
charge so grave would necessarily involve loss of&#xD;
character, and my ultimate ruin, I would consider&#xD;
it as dust in the balance, when compared with the&#xD;
perpetual consciousness I shall carry with me, of&#xD;
having been intrusted with power and position, and&#xD;
that while in the exercise of that power I became&#xD;
recre ant to the trust--lost sight 9f duty, and was&#xD;
&#xD;
guilty of judicial murder-worse than maliciously&#xD;
imbruing my hands in the blood of a fellow-be..&#xD;
ins'&#xD;
The fearful pangs of the deepest remorse had&#xD;
seized the Judge, an&amp;amp; was drinking up his very&#xD;
blood. The more he contemplated his unfaithful-&#xD;
ness, the more criminal it appeared to him, until he&#xD;
knew not how to act, or what disposition to make&#xD;
of himself.&#xD;
Jones was formed, intellectually and physically,&#xD;
m nature's finest mould. The son of wealthy an-&#xD;
cestors, he had been cradled in the lap of luxury&#xD;
and aflluence~-had received a finished classical&#xD;
and legal education, hnd had but fairly entered&#xD;
upon the duties of the legal profession when he&#xD;
ivas called, by the almost unanimous voice of the&#xD;
people, to a seat upon the Supreme bench of his&#xD;
native State, with high hopes and a soul as pure-&#xD;
as spotless as the ermine that enveloped him.&#xD;
Judge Jones, in company with Leblonci and sev-&#xD;
eral other distinguished members of the bar and&#xD;
politicians, had, during the previous evening, been&#xD;
discussing law, politics, and matters and things in&#xD;
general, over a basket of sparkling Catawba, little&#xD;
dreaming of the extent of the terrible tempest that&#xD;
was about to pervade his soul-desolate his peace&#xD;
and drive him to the verge of madness.&#xD;
At the close of his interview with Leblond, Judge&#xD;
Jones repaired to the Court room and adjourned&#xD;
the Court sine die, amid the wonder and amazement&#xD;

14                 THE UNJLtS~I' JUDGES                                                               TilE IJNJtJST 5UDGI~.               15&#xD;
&#xD;
of the bar, under the pretence of important dome~&#xD;
tic duties which imperiously demanded his atten~&#xD;
tion at home- -ordered his carriage, and was soon&#xD;
on his way to the pleasant village of B~ in the&#xD;
Southern part of the State, where he expected to&#xD;
meet a woman, "beautiful as the hourss" who had&#xD;
"blessed him with her love and made him the fa-&#xD;
tlier of her children." But, with his haggard coun-&#xD;
tenance and perturbed feelings, how was he to&#xD;
me'~t the amiable partner of his weal and his woe,&#xD;
was a question that had not until now occurred to&#xD;
him. He determined to acquaint her with all the&#xD;
facts and circumstances connected with this in ost&#xD;
unpleasant affair, an(l then consoled himself with&#xD;
the reflection that his devoted wife, whom he re-&#xD;
garded as the very impersonation of all that was&#xD;
good and lovely, would at least sympathize with&#xD;
him, if she did not pour balm into his wounded&#xD;
heart and administer to his lacerated feelings,&#xD;
and in the extacy of the moment he exclaimed-&#xD;
"A wife! AL gentle deities~ ! uui he&#xD;
W1O has a wife &amp;amp;re feel aJver~ity ?"  /&#xD;
But how fitful is hope, though the anchor of the&#xD;
soul, and without which life, from the cradle to the&#xD;
tomb, would be a dire ary passage-a dense dark-&#xD;
ness, without a ray of light to cheer us on our dis-.&#xD;
mal way.. The bliss of hope is often short lived as&#xD;
the meteor's flash, which, when extinguished, tends&#xD;
to make the darkness more keenly felt. When&#xD;
hope ceases to illumine our path, despair occupies&#xD;
&#xD;
its place, in degree proportioned to the fervency&#xD;
of the former occupant.&#xD;
Home gained, the horses were handed over to&#xD;
the servant, and the Judge entered his mansion,&#xD;
upon the threshold of which he was met by his&#xD;
smiling and faithful wife, and two or three little&#xD;
prattling pledges of their love, with "pa's turn,&#xD;
ia's turn !" In the midst of this friendly greet-&#xD;
ing, the following lines occurred to him-&#xD;
hope fortim&amp;amp;s cheating lottery.&#xD;
Where, for one vrize, an hundred blanks there bc."&#xD;
That from which he had hoped produced torture&#xD;
more exerutiating than the rack. The Judge was&#xD;
the soul of honor, and he felt himself degraded-&#xD;
unworthy of such unmeasured devotion and affec-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Sink a man in his own estimation and you carry~&#xD;
unerringly, the fearful havoc of certain ruin into&#xD;
his future hopes and prospects, more eilectua.llv&#xD;
than if you rob him of the confidence and regard&#xD;
of the entire human family.&#xD;
The condition of the Judge's feelings were not&#xD;
long unobserved by the affectionate eye of Mrs.&#xD;
Jones, who immediately, in the kindest and most&#xD;
amiable in anner possible, set about ascertaining&#xD;
the cause. He fully unbosomed himself to her,&#xD;
and she supposing, what was the fact, that it was&#xD;
his first flagrant departure from the path of integ-&#xD;
rity, attempted to sooth his crushed feelings as&#xD;
none but fond and doting wife know:&#xD;

"My dear, you have your own forgiveness-you&#xD;
have mine. Ask and obtain God's, who giveth freely&#xD;
and upbraideth none, and then console yourself&#xD;
with the thought, that though to err is human, you&#xD;

no man, whose esteem and regard are worth re-&#xD;
taining, will attach any importance to your having&#xD;
this once been so foolish as to permit yourself to&#xD;
become intoxicated. If this is your last offence,&#xD;
as I know it will be, it will neither impair your in-&#xD;
Iluenee nor your standing among your political&#xD;
friends. May I now entertain the hope you will&#xD;
swear upon the altar of our affections that you&#xD;
will never again touch, taste, or handle, the intox-&#xD;
icating cup ?"&#xD;
"I swear," said the Judge. "Though that may&#xD;
save yourself and these dear little cherubs from&#xD;
penury and want-from wretchedness and woe,-&#xD;
tell me, oh! say how am I to snatch my unfortunate&#xD;
victim from the ignominious scaffold? A doomed&#xD;
man, around whom a tender daughter's affections&#xD;
are convulsively bound-for whom a wife's heart&#xD;
&#xD;
i~ bleeding at every pore; an innocent man-from&#xD;
this cruel, this undeserved fate. Will my reforma-&#xD;
tion rescue this injured, this wretched man, from&#xD;
shame, infamy, degradation and death? It will&#xD;
save those immediately dependent upon me for&#xD;
character and support; but, alas ! alas ! it is im-&#xD;
potent to save him, for whose safety and redemp-&#xD;
tion, [ would separate with every dollar I have on&#xD;
earth-even death would he a welcome messen-&#xD;
gerif by the sacrifice Hamlin could be restored to&#xD;
his rights, to safety, to his friends; and I relieved&#xD;
from~ this bitter, 1)iting remorse."&#xD;
"Is frequent drinkiiig a common habit among&#xD;
urn members of the bar?" remarked Mrs. Jones.&#xD;
She had, iii this inquiry, the two-fold object of as-&#xD;
certaining the extent of the temptation to which&#xD;
her husband (who wa~ coimtantly mixing with le-&#xD;
gal gentlemen in different parts of the State,)&#xD;
would be submitted, and to divert his mind grad-&#xD;
ually from the contemplation of a subject which&#xD;
was so well calculated to destroy his peace.&#xD;
"There are many exceptions, but I regret the&#xD;
truth compels me to admit that a very large ma-&#xD;
.j ority of the members of the bar; everywhere, are&#xD;
in the habit of tippling," said the Judge.&#xD;
"That is hmost strange and unaccountable," re-&#xD;
plied Mrs. Jones; "as I have always regarded&#xD;

themselves to become emitangled in the meshes of&#xD;
trouble of any description."&#xD;
"Your views of the profession arc correct," said&#xD;
the Judge. " The nature of their pursuits make&#xD;
them the kind of men you describe. It is their&#xD;
itinerant and social habits that make them incline&#xD;
to this sin, which is, in its incipient stages at least,&#xD;
if not through its entire course, a social vice. The&#xD;
younger members of the bar, more particularly,&#xD;
are all more or less addicted to it. Some, as age&#xD;
increases, drink less, and finally quit entirely ;&#xD;
while others drink more and more, until they ga&#xD;
over the dam. The vice ha~ made heavy (h~aft8&#xD;

functionaries, is a fearful spectacle; one over which&#xD;
humanity drops the syml)atIietic tear."&#xD;
I             "It is a most insidious vice," said the Judge. " its&#xD;

the allusion, or delicately made. He regards it as&#xD;
an impeachment of his skill and ability-his feel-&#xD;
ings are wounded, and he, probably, alienated for-&#xD;
ever from a friend."&#xD;
Judge Jones now arose and walked the room in&#xD;
silence for nearly an hour, while Mrs. Jones would&#xD;
occasionally attempt to break in upon his media~&#xD;
tions by interrogatories, but he answered none,&#xD;
and appeared unconscious of her presence. At&#xD;
length he exclaimed, "In less than seventy-two&#xD;
hours from this time, Hamlin expiates upon the&#xD;

Mrs. Jones, in the meantime, had become ex-&#xD;

Though she fully appreciated the strength and&#xD;
vigor of his intellect, yet she feared the fierce con-.&#xD;
tention of conflicting emotions might drive his&#xD;

the fertile resources common to women of culti-&#xD;

Judge the propriety of seeking executive clemency&#xD;
in behalf of Hamlin.&#xD;
A gleam of light flashed across his disturbed&#xD;
mind, and he cried out, "Why did not that thought&#xD;

On leaving Judge Jones, Leblond i~eturned to his&#xD;
office, lie had closed the business of a protrac-&#xD;
ted and laborious term of court, in which he had&#xD;
woii golden opinions and reaped a rich harvest in&#xD;
the shape of numerous and heavy retainers. Af&#xD;
te~' depositing hi~ green bag, and adjusting and&#xD;
arranging in pidge on-holes numerous notes, bills,&#xD;

chair--his feet upon a table-lighted a cigar, and&#xD;
amid&#xD;
Thick curlino' clouds&#xD;
Of smoke around his reeking temples"--&#xD;
began the fohloxving soliloquy: "Well, I have done&#xD;
a fine business this term--have been engaged in&#xD;
every cause of importance tried at bar, and have&#xD;
succeeded, in each, beyond my most sanguine ex-&#xD;

his pride, and frequently transforms him from a&#xD;

human heart. I must avoid every thing that has&#xD;
the slightest appearance of vanity,, and if I can re.&#xD;

"If Amelia could but know how fate was smiling&#xD;

as more than "a poor and unlettered boy." I would&#xD;
have freely given one half of my fees for the term,&#xD;
if that lovely girl could have been present and wit~&#xD;
messed my display and my triumph, (after several&#xD;
years of toil and privation) particularly in that case&#xD;
for breach of marriage promise. But, in the ab~.&#xD;
sence of that gratification, I must content myself&#xD;
with the consolation afforded from a large verdict,&#xD;
one half of which, in the shape of a thousand dob&#xD;

owner. Had she been there, would she have turned&#xD;
up her pretty little proboscis, as usual, and repeated,&#xD;
"he i~ a poor and unlettered boy, with a strong&#xD;
proclivity to dissipation?" No, sir-ee! She would&#xD;
have done no such thing. She loved me; of that&#xD;
I have never entertained a serious doubt. It was&#xD;
her austere and aristocratic father who was inca~&#xD;

"Now," continued Leblond, "I must make some&#xD;
arrangements for the coming campaign. Before I&#xD;
leave, I must deposit with sonic eight or ten gro-&#xD;

he, "I must confess, I am unable to see the phi-&#xD;
losophy of "lead us not into temptation," unless&#xD;
they mean that temptation only strengthens virtue&#xD;

Leblond was from the very vale of obscurity.-&#xD;
flis parents in extreme indigence) wcre wholly un-&#xD;
&#xD;
able to afford him the means of even a common&#xD;
English education. Necessity, therefore, compelled&#xD;
him to leave the parental roof at the tender age of&#xD;
twelve, with ardent aspirations for distinction, gui-&#xD;
ded in the rugged path of life alone by his lofty&#xD;
intellect and intuitive sense of right and wrong.&#xD;
It is seldom that one, so young is ambitious of fu-&#xD;
ture distinction. But his mother, a woman of more&#xD;
than ordinary intellect, fair education, and consid-&#xD;
erable reading, had taught him to read almost a~&#xD;
soon as he could distinctly articulate words. It&#xD;
was her common practice to devote some three&#xD;
hours, out of every twenty-four, to the instruction&#xD;
of her son. When other duties drew unusually&#xD;
heavy upon her time, which was not infrequent,&#xD;
she spem~t a portion of those hours that other moth-&#xD;
ers generally give to sleep and repose, to the moral&#xD;
and intellectual culture of her boy, pointing him&#xD;
frequently to illustrious characters living, as well&#xD;
as those who had left their impress upon time anti&#xD;
gone to their reward, and would stimulate him to&#xD;
emulate their example. During the three years&#xD;
previous to his leaving home, the daily aliment of&#xD;
his soul was ambition.&#xD;
Somewhat remote from home, he entered into&#xD;
the employ of one of nature's noblemen-an hor~-&#xD;
est cultivator of the soil. This connection, which&#xD;
lasted for about the period of two years, was not&#xD;
without its advantages to young Leblond. Though&#xD;

scarcely sufficient to flirnish him with the coarsest&#xD;
clothing, he was taught industry and integrity,&#xD;
which lie at tho foundation of success in every pur-&#xD;
suit in life.&#xD;
Before leaving home, his mother had taught him&#xD;
to right a legible hand, and therefore required him&#xD;
to write her two letters per week, and embrace the&#xD;
first opportunity that presented, of sending them&#xD;
to her by private conveyance. These she woul(l&#xD;
sometimes receive in packages of seven or eight&#xD;
at once, owing to the want of opportunity to send&#xD;
them at the time of writing. When they arrived,&#xD;
she would invariably aiiswer theni at the earliest&#xD;
possible moment. One of those replies was as&#xD;
follows:&#xD;
"IN/li DEAR SON :-Your package of letters&#xD;
came to hand to-day, and their perusal afforded&#xD;

g~es, relying upon the integrity of his employer and&#xD;
his determination to make himself useful; where&#xD;
he remained for the period of four years. During&#xD;
business hours he devoted his undivided attention to&#xD;
the interest of his employer, and consequently, be-.&#xD;
came highly esteemed, not only by the proprietor&#xD;
of the establishment, but the favorite clerk of the&#xD;
village. His habit was, immediately after busi-&#xD;
ness hours closed, to retire to his private r~oni,&#xD;
where he had a small but well selected library, and&#xD;
when his health would permit, remained there,&#xD;
pouring over his books until one, and occasionally,&#xD;
two o'clock in the morning. And thus, in the&#xD;
course of the four years, he acquired an accurate&#xD;
knowledge of English Grammar, Geography, Arith-&#xD;
nietic, ai~d Algebra, together with considerable&#xD;
knowledge of history.&#xD;
At the close of his apprenticeship, with improved&#xD;
manners, business habits of the first order, and&#xD;
four hundred dollars in his pocket, he took up his&#xD;
line of march for college; where, by the most rigid&#xD;
economy, he was enabled to remain for about three&#xD;
years. Leblond acquired, during the period he&#xD;
was in school, about the same usually accomplished&#xD;
by a college routine; and at the age of twenty-one,&#xD;
found himself in possession of a vigorous and well&#xD;
disciplined intellect, but without means-indeed,&#xD;
in abject poverty. His education now completed&#xD;
to the extent of his means he determined to enter-.&#xD;
upon the study of the law, and accordingly ap~.&#xD;
&#xD;
lv&#xD;
&#xD;
plied to Sibley, a lawyer alike distinguished for&#xD;
his legal acumen and oratorical powers; but not&#xD;
less distinguished for his habits of tippling.&#xD;
Sibley, once the pride of a large circle of friends,&#xD;
with a practice that bid fair to make him speedily&#xD;
rich, from the known and acknowledged social hab-&#xD;
its of the bar, had gradually contracted the ruin-&#xD;
otis habit of occasional dram-drinking, was now&#xD;
in the whirlpool of that most destructive vice; in&#xD;
imminent danger of gliding over the cataract. With-&#xD;
out practice-without friends-without character.&#xD;
and destitute of property, he supposed that a stu-&#xD;
(lent of Leblond's superior intellect and integrity,&#xD;
would attach some importance to himself, and was&#xD;
therefore induced to receive him into his office.&#xD;
Leblond remained two years in Sibley's office,&#xD;
and assiduously studied the law, occasionally teach-&#xD;
ing or writing in some of the public offices, suffi-&#xD;
dent to keep soul and body together, and was&#xD;
finally admitted to the bar with as bright prospects&#xD;
as talent of a high order, a xvell stored, highly cul-&#xD;
tivated, nicely trained mind could possibly harbin-&#xD;

or imagined they saw, in his conduct, the effects&#xD;

Judge J;ones reached the seat of government in&#xD;

After having patiently heard Jones narrate the&#xD;
circumstances connected with the charge of mur-&#xD;
der, the Governor, with no little sang [Thid re-&#xD;
marked, "This man Hamhin, we are bound to sup-&#xD;
pose, has lad a fair and impartial trial? Why&#xD;
disturb the result of that investigation ? 1 under-&#xD;
stand you to say, Judge, that you presided upon the&#xD;
trial of this cause. Now, Judge Jones, a lawyer of&#xD;
your ability ought not to allow a man to be im-&#xD;
properly convicted. Yet if that should happen&#xD;
without evidence and in violation of right and jus-&#xD;
tice, you had a sovereign remedy for all this&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
"Governor," interrupted the Judge, "1 have ever&#xD;
detested a Judicial tyrant; and have, therefore, in&#xD;
my administration of justice, contented myself&#xD;
&#xD;
with simply giving the law in charge to the jury.&#xD;
To go beyond that, would be a most unpardonable&#xD;
innovation of the peculiar province of the jury,&#xD;
and~ a flagrant violation of the spirit, if not of the&#xD;
letter of the constitution and laws of our State,&#xD;
which I am bound by the solemnities of an official&#xD;
oath to observe."&#xD;
The Judge had very minutely detailed to the&#xD;
Governor the testimony in the case, and his Ex-&#xD;
cellency being an able lawyer, and once a bright&#xD;
luminary of the bench which Judge Jones, with&#xD;
equal ability, had so signally disgraced with ap-&#xD;
parent great carelessness, inquired of the Judge&#xD;
what he had ruled the law to be upon certain close&#xD;
and interesting' points arising on the facts stated.&#xD;
This was a poser for which Judge Jones was en-&#xD;
tirely ninprepared. He stammered, evaded, and&#xD;
was silent. The Governor pressed the inquiry.&#xD;
Jones hesitated, but being incapable of the base-&#xD;
ness of falsehood, remarked: "I nmst have the&#xD;
frankness to admit that I know not upon what&#xD;
points, nor how I iwilecl the law."&#xD;
"how can that be possible ?" immediately re-&#xD;
plied the Governor. -&#xD;
"Your Excellency is well aware that your honor&#xD;
and myself have a strong partiality for an occa&#xD;
sional mint julip."&#xD;
"Mint juhip h-h,. and partiality the d-l!"&#xD;
sharply retorted the Governor; quite as much dis-&#xD;
turbed by the allusion to his own besetting sin, as&#xD;

tinu~d he, "rely upon it, Judge, if a similar derelic-&#xD;
tion of duty should come under my observation,&#xD;
measures shall be taken for your immediate im-&#xD;

Judge Jones had passed through an ordeal which&#xD;
humbled his pride no little, but his success in pro-&#xD;
curing the pardon he regarded as a sufficient off-&#xD;
set. lie, therefore, pocketed the paper and pro-&#xD;

the letter from Jewctt, intending to pass directly&#xD;
on to N. and deliver to the Sheriff the pardon be-&#xD;
fore the expiration df the time assigned for the ex-&#xD;
ecution, but while at the depot during the water-&#xD;
ing operation of the train, Leblond, anxious to&#xD;
meet the Judge, made his appearance, and thus&#xD;
accosted him:&#xD;
"I am happy indeed, sir, you have received our&#xD;
dispatch," and without giving Jones time to reply,&#xD;
Leblond continued, "we will have a sumptuous&#xD;
&#xD;
~ast and a glorious old-fashioned time of it, to-&#xD;
night; a perfect burst-up, and no mistakee"&#xD;
"I have received no dispatch," said the Judge,&#xD;
"but regret to inform you that it is utterly impos-&#xD;
sible for me to be with you."&#xD;
"Then you have not received our dispatch," said&#xD;
Leblond. " That is very disagreeable news. I&#xD;
had hoped you received it, and were now here in&#xD;
obedience to it. We shall have an exceedingly&#xD;
pleasant time."&#xD;
"I have no doubt of it," said the Judge, "but I&#xD;
have been to the Governor and procured a pardon&#xD;
for Hamlin, which II must proceed with, lest some&#xD;
accident may detain me; and in that event, my&#xD;
friend Ilainlin and I may never meet until in the.&#xD;
presence of a very different tribunal from the one&#xD;
before which you have been appearing, and I con-&#xD;
s tituting."&#xD;
Leblond insisted upon Judge Jones remaining,&#xD;
and partaking of the hospitality of the bar; and&#xD;
after exhausting every other inducement his fertile&#xD;
imagination could conceive of, finally remarked,&#xD;
that the train would leave at six in the morning,&#xD;
which would afford him ample time to reach N.&#xD;
before the execution could take place; and that, of&#xD;
course, was all that Jones could desire; and add-&#xD;
ed, if the Judge would consent to remain, he would&#xD;
accompany him to N. the next morning, and that&#xD;
was no inconsiderable inducement to a gentleman&#xD;
fond of good company.&#xD;

&#xD;
After considerable hesitation, and expressing to&#xD;
Leblond many doubts, as to the propriety of his&#xD;
remaining over, permitted his baggage to be car~&#xD;
ned to the hotel.&#xD;
About eight that evening, Judge Jones was con~&#xD;
ducted, by Leblond, into a room most brilliantly&#xD;
lighted, in which was a table groaning under the&#xD;
weight of every luxury of the season, and inter-&#xD;
spercee plentifully among the dishes, were numer-&#xD;
otis well filled bottles, of every size and complexion,&#xD;
containing liquors of every character and descrip-~&#xD;
tion, from sparkling champaign down to old Mo-&#xD;
nogahela whiskey.&#xD;
If demons and lost spirits are supposed to be&#xD;
conscious of what is transpiring on earth, and ca-&#xD;
pable of rejoicing at the danger and depravity of&#xD;
those who are upon the probationary side~ of the&#xD;
spirit land, what a general jubilee there must be&#xD;
in perdition, over these drunken banquets.&#xD;
"Ali Brandy, Brandy; bane of life,&#xD;
Spring of tumult, source of strife;&#xD;
Could I but half thy curses tell,&#xD;
The wise would wish thee safe in hell."&#xD;
Our friends, numbering twenty-five lawyers,&#xD;
three judges, and several officers of court, all seated&#xD;
around the festive board, now partook bountifully&#xD;
of the viands, spread in rich luxuriance before&#xD;
them, nor did they fail to make heavy draughts&#xD;
upon the bottled death that graced the repast.&#xD;
The 'cloth removed, Judge Jones was called upon&#xD;
to preside, but positively refused. his feelings&#xD;

THE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
were not in unison with the occasion. His active&#xD;
mind was, alternately, in the past and the future,&#xD;
engaged in other matters of more weighty moment,&#xD;
~-the bacchanalian revelry around him had but lit-&#xD;
tie of his sympathy. What would he not have&#xD;
given could he, on that evening, after he had time&#xD;
for thought and reflection, been present with 11am-&#xD;
lin in his solitary cell, relieving him from the dread&#xD;
horror of impending dissolution? But-&#xD;
"Experience teaches us&#xD;
That resolution 's a sole help at need."&#xD;
'This resolution th~ Judge lacked, and hence he&#xD;
was drunk on the flamlin trial. He wanted reso-&#xD;
lution when he was met by Leblond, at the depot;&#xD;
and hence he was at the bar supper. He lacked&#xD;
resolution when invited to preside over the dis-&#xD;
graceful scenes of that evening; hence the post of&#xD;
honor was conferred upon him.&#xD;
A long list of unfortunate individuals who have&#xD;
l)een guilty of imprudence, of folly; ay, of crime;&#xD;
would have been saved had they been taught, in&#xD;
carly life, the importance of decision of character.&#xD;
resolution, and firmness of purpose.&#xD;
"The indications are that we shall have-&#xD;
"The feast of reason and the flow of soul,"&#xD;
said Judge Alban.&#xD;
"Rather a feast of nonsense and a flow of whis~&#xD;

" Where is Barber," enquired some one 'present,&#xD;
"he is the soul of sociality and convivialitjy, arid&#xD;

Leblond took advantage of the occasion, by ac-&#xD;
r~moniously charging' Barber with giving in his ad-&#xD;
hesion to the temperance organizations of the day,&#xD;
and wound up by remarking, that lie lIa(l actually&#xD;

(lifliCuit to detc~ mine to what lengths he would not&#xD;
go 'upon that and kindred fanaficisrn; that he was&#xD;
quite to ilhbei'aI to enjoy a tete-a-tele with a few&#xD;
friends, or even a good supper, when the fa tues of&#xD;
alcohol were about the board.&#xD;
Judge Jones repaired to the head of the table,&#xD;
and took his seat as president, and thereupon.&#xD;
(Irank the following toast:-&#xD;
"The Bar-a pioncet' in the marit of mind. In&#xD;
science and in morals it occupies the front rank.--&#xD;
It has ever been conspicuous for its influence, in-&#xD;
telli gence, integrity, and liberality."&#xD;
To which all quaffed their glasses and responde(l&#xD;
in three long, loud, and deafening cheers.&#xD;
.Tones here turned and whispered to Leblond,&#xD;
that the bar was not over-rtocked with morality,&#xD;
taking that, and similar occasions, a.s a criterion&#xD;
'by which to estimate it.&#xD;
Leblond replied, that no class of men could in&#xD;
truth, boast of a purer morality than the bar. That&#xD;
their intercourse with their clients, and with soci-&#xD;
ety generally, would bear the test of the most rigid&#xD;
&#xD;
scrutiny, and would compare more than favorably,&#xD;
with any portion of our fellow-citizens.&#xD;
"So far as your views of the integrity of the bar&#xD;
are concerned, you are correct," said the Judge.&#xD;
"But I am at a loss to know by what rule in ethics&#xD;
you would make drunkenness a virtue; and dis-&#xD;
guise the fact as you may, the bar is fond of spi~ee-&#xD;
ing, and drinks too ixmcii."&#xD;
Leblond was now loudly called to give a senti-&#xD;
ment, and anxious to deal a blow at his absent corn-&#xD;
petitor for Con2i'e~ d~x~111~ LL~~ iuiiuxiuig toast&#xD;
The lawyer who has'nt suffleient nerve to face&#xD;
this array of bottles is unworthy of public confi-&#xD;

Judge Alban, and several others, by this time&#xD;
quite " mellow," siniultaneously hiceoughed, "that&#xD;
am a f~ et ;" and all joined in a boisterous laugh-&#xD;
icr except Judge Jones, who felt 'that it would have&#xD;
been better for himself, for I tamlin, and the public,&#xD;
if he had lacked upon that trial the rascally virtue&#xD;
of facing a mint julip.&#xD;
But, as hilarity and uproa~iowA joy constituted&#xD;
the order of the evening, and Judge Jones feeling&#xD;
~omewliat comfortable over his l)ardon, aided by&#xD;
an occasional bumper, let himself doxvn-and still&#xD;
lowei-until finally he became one of them.&#xD;
The scene soon began 'to beggar description!&#xD;
While some were hurrahing for Jackson, for old&#xD;
Zack, for Matty Yan, for Lundy's Lane~-others&#xD;
were attempting repartee and speech-making. At&#xD;

&#xD;
this moment, the proprietor of the hotel, who had&#xD;
been absent during the evening, made his appoar-&#xD;
ance at the door, and stood for a few moments,&#xD;
unobserved by his drunken patrons. Cowpcr&#xD;
says that-&#xD;
Even bacchanalian madness has its charms."&#xD;
But it had no charms for their worthy host, who,&#xD;
after viewing the scene before him, for a brief pe-&#xD;
riod, turned in disgust, and remarked to a friend&#xD;
It is claimed that Judges and lai&amp;amp;yers are privi-&#xD;
leged characters, but that transcend~ all privilege.&#xD;
These are "priests who minister at the altar in the&#xD;
sacred temple of human justice." These are the&#xD;
men who make the laws and administer them.-&#xD;
These are the men who give tone and character to&#xD;
society, and rule the political world. I pray I may&#xD;
ever be protected from such justice, from such laws&#xD;
and from such rule. The Bar," continued he, "are&#xD;
usually educated, and from the nature of their pur-&#xD;
suits, become eaTly acquainted with human nature,&#xD;
-are generally good public speakers-acquire&#xD;
confidence in themselves-take the lead in politics,&#xD;
and all the great enterprises that favor the growth,&#xD;
prosperity and happiness of our country. With&#xD;
some three exceptions, all the Presidents of the&#xD;
United States have been lawyers, and their Cabi-&#xD;
nets have been lawyers; forty-nine fiftieths of all&#xD;
our United States Senators have beeii lawyers; our&#xD;
diplomatic corps has been filled with lawyers; in&#xD;
short," continued he, "all our great statesmen and&#xD;
&#xD;
distinguished men, have been lawyers; and yet,&#xD;
this is a fair specimen of their habits."&#xD;
Though none had passed out of the room, it was&#xD;
observed the crowd began to lessen, and upon ex-&#xD;
amination, Judge Alban, Prosecutor Lahm, the&#xD;
Sheriff, and a number of others, were under the&#xD;
table and in the corners of the hall, locked in the&#xD;
arms of morpheus.&#xD;
Two of these disciples of Lycurgus, less up than&#xD;
some, and lcss down than others, aided Jones to&#xD;
his sleeping apartment for the remainder of the&#xD;
night; where, in unconscious stupor, he remained&#xD;
until after the departure of the six o'clock train&#xD;

CHAPTER W~&#xD;
A politician. Proteus-like, must alter&#xD;
his face and habit, and like water) seen~&#xD;
Of the same color that the vessel is&#xD;
That doth contain it, varying his form,&#xD;
With the chameleon, at each object's change.&#xD;
2ifason.&#xD;
Barber was an eminent lawyer, and some years&#xD;
Leblond's senior. A man of kind impulses, strict&#xD;
integrity, and temperate in all things. Never&#xD;
stooped to baseness, nor would he allow another&#xD;
to be guilty of meanness with impunity when he&#xD;
was the object of attack. lie had heard of Le-&#xD;
blond's toast, and as it had been publicly made,&#xD;
he supposed that even magnanimity did not ye-.&#xD;
quire him to go privately to Leblond and request&#xD;
a retraction, but prepared for the press, and pub-&#xD;
lished in a newspaper 'of the village, the following&#xD;
article:&#xD;
"LUCIUS LEBLOND, Esct:&#xD;
Sir :-Because we are competitors for the&#xD;
same office, it does not necessarily imply that we&#xD;
should engage in wholesale and retail slander and&#xD;
detraction of each other. I have hitherto supposed,&#xD;
that among gentlemen, the sanctity of private&#xD;
character was never invaded, even in warm polid-.&#xD;
&#xD;
cal contests. It is barely possible I may have been&#xD;
in error all my life upon this subject.&#xD;
I am a candidate, and should the people regard&#xD;
me as "honest and capable," and elect n-ic, I shall&#xD;
be highly gratified; but if success is to be at the&#xD;
cost and expense of a sacrifice of principle-if, in&#xD;
order to succeed, I must lay off the gentleman and&#xD;
assume the ruffian, then I shall not succeed.&#xD;
"Some rise by sin, and seine by virtue fall."&#xD;
I infinitely prefer the latter. Will you occupy the&#xD;
same platform? If so, I have no fear as to the re-&#xD;
suIt. Should you, howev'~r, continue to stab me&#xD;
in the dark, as I am informed you did at the bar&#xD;
supper, a few evenings since, I shall regard you in&#xD;
your true chat'acter, and act upon the principle&#xD;
th at-~&#xD;
"Kites, hawks and wolves tieserve their fate."&#xD;
And here I may as well say, I hope not to survive&#xD;
the day when I shall have "nerve sufficient to face"&#xD;
as many bottles as, in your opinion, would entitle&#xD;
meto "public confidence."&#xD;
Very Respectfully,&#xD;
J. BARBER."&#xD;
Leblond had been, for some time, anxious to en~&#xD;
tangle his competitor in the meshes of a personal&#xD;
difficulty, with the hope of covering his own de~&#xD;
fects, as well as obscuring the purer character and&#xD;
more elevated principles of Barber; and it was&#xD;
with that view he 4~de the attack upon him at&#xD;
the bar supper. Leblond was a demagogue, though&#xD;

42            THE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
48&#xD;
&#xD;
a young man of superior intellect and consider~&#xD;
ble popularity, yet he feared an open field and a&#xD;
fair fight with Barber! He, therefore, determined&#xD;
to attack him personally, and in case Barber re-&#xD;
pelled with severity the attack, to fight it out as&#xD;
best he could-turn everything to the best possi~&#xD;
ble account, and as it aproximated the close, cry&#xD;
out persecution, and in that way enlist the syrnpa~&#xD;
thies of a class of men whom he could not, by any&#xD;
other means, hope to reach.&#xD;
The above note from Barber furnished Leblond&#xD;
with what he deemed a sufficient excuse for attack-&#xD;
ing him personally, in the next issue of the Ga-&#xD;
zette, as follows:&#xD;
"J. BARBER, Es~:&#xD;
$ir :-In the last Gazette, you say you have&#xD;
been in error all your life if I am a gentleman.&#xD;
That you have been in error all your life few men,&#xD;
who have known you during that time, will doubt;&#xD;
and that you will continue befogged for the baN&#xD;
ance of your days, their can be as little doubt.&#xD;
Before the campaign closes, I will enable you&#xD;
to see yourself as others see you, and that will be&#xD;
in no favorable light. You manifestly desire a&#xD;
personal quarrel. If this is your wish, you shall&#xD;
be gratified to the extent of your inclination. I&#xD;
will expose to the public gaze some of your infamy&#xD;
in your private relations and professional charac-&#xD;
ter, which will cause the 1*od to mantle your&#xD;
~beek if you are not an entire stranger to sensibil-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ity. How far you will then be able to avail your-&#xD;
self of advantage from an alliance with temper-&#xD;
ance organizations, will remain to be seen.&#xD;
Very Respectfully,&#xD;
L. LEBLOND."&#xD;
The Congressional District was composed mainly&#xD;
of new counties, and numerous public improve-&#xD;
ments in, and through the territory, were in a state&#xD;
of progression, and Leblond flattered himself if he&#xD;
could raise the temperance issue with Barber, he&#xD;
could defeat him with entire ease; that if he could&#xD;
rally around him the whole of the foreign popula-&#xD;
tion upon the public works, and the undivided&#xD;
liquor influence; victory must necessarily perch&#xD;
upon his banner. It was for this purpose Leblond&#xD;
sought to draw Barber out upon the temperance&#xD;
question.&#xD;
Barber was frank and honest, if possible, to a&#xD;
fault. Intendii~g nothing but fairness, was slow&#xD;
to suspect its opposite in others.&#xD;
Peeling himself deeply aggrieved by the personal&#xD;
attack of Leblond, in the last Gazette, replied to&#xD;
h~m as follows:&#xD;
"L. LEBLOND, Es~:&#xD;

From me, sir, you have received more than from&#xD;
all the rest of the world. I took you by the hand&#xD;
when destitution was your only portion. With&#xD;
more than parental interest and solicitude, I watch-&#xD;
ed the budding of what I regarded, at that time,&#xD;
of a superior intellect. XYhile I mourned over&#xD;
your tendencies to vice and immorality, I lifted you&#xD;
into the profession which you have disgraced, and&#xD;
so long as you remain intemperate, will continue&#xD;

In the prostitution of your talents, you do your-&#xD;
self and community great injustice. I need scarce-&#xD;
ly say, you are in the possession of sufficient in-&#xD;
tellect, if properly dircctedio make yourself emi-&#xD;
nently useful. But, most unfortunately for your-&#xD;
self and those with whom you are, and ever will&#xD;
be associated, you have entirely omitted the culti-&#xD;
vation of the heart and the moral faculties. When&#xD;
&#xD;
the head has been cultivated, and moral culture&#xD;
overlooked-when the whole region of the heart&#xD;
and soul becomes a desolate waste, inhabited only&#xD;
by the fiercest passions of our nature, and over-&#xD;
grown with noxious plants, the possessor be-&#xD;
comes dangerotis to the most important inter-&#xD;
ests of God and humanity, in proportion as he&#xD;
has povvcr and vigor of intellect.&#xD;
You may blacken my character for the time be-&#xD;

gold, cannot be impaired, though they may both&#xD;

aiul the other by foul aspersion.&#xD;

of my every act, public and private. Sift the mat-&#xD;

mediately to withdraw my name from before the&#xD;

Fairness is a duty we alike owe ourselves and&#xD;
the electors of our district.&#xD;
You seek, I doubt not for a base purpose, to&#xD;
draw from me an admission of an alliance with&#xD;
the temperance organizations of the district. This&#xD;
I could not do for the very plain and simple reason&#xD;
that it is not the fact. I am, however, in favor of&#xD;
temperance and sobriety in all things. But here I&#xD;

will say, I should regard the universal reign of the&#xD;
Maine law, or a p'ohibitory law, similar in its fea-&#xD;
tures, in every State in this Union, as an indica-&#xD;
tion that God, in the plenitude of his mercy, was&#xD;
smiling upon our highly favored Republic; Why&#xD;
we should have in common use, as a beverage, al-&#xD;
coholic drinks, from which no man can derive any&#xD;
advantage, but from which unnumbered scores are&#xD;
deriving serious detriment, while the moral atmos~&#xD;
phere, through its influence, assumes the shape of&#xD;
contagion itself, and life, happiness, intelligence&#xD;
and all the social virtues are suffering from it~ con-&#xD;
tact is, and ever has been to me, a profound mys-&#xD;
tery. And why a man of sober and temperate&#xD;
habits could not with as much ability and distinc-&#xD;
tion, represent the people of this district in the halls&#xD;
of our national legislature, as if he had " strong&#xD;
proclivities to dissipation," is also somewhat mys~&#xD;
serious.&#xD;
The object of your temperance allusion is dis-&#xD;

in the virtue and wisdom of the masses, enables&#xD;

Leblond, now that Barber had completely com-&#xD;
mitted himself upon a prohibitory liquor law, was&#xD;
satisfied he had him in the net he had been spread-&#xD;
ing for him, and that all he had to do was to spring it.&#xD;
&#xD;
40&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
This he determined to do with adroitness and dis-&#xD;
patch, lie, accordingly, abandoned all idea of vis-&#xD;
iting the home of his early youth-entered vigor-&#xD;
ously into the campaign, upon the principle that&#xD;
"eternal vigilance is the price of" political success.&#xD;
his first move was tQ procure a copy of the Ga-&#xD;
zette, containing Barber's communication. This&#xD;
he carried with him, and invariably, but cautiously,&#xD;
felt about and sounded every man whom he met,&#xD;
and if he found him opposed to the Maine law he&#xD;
would carefully read to him that portion of the ar-&#xD;
ticle in which Barber expressed his desire to see&#xD;
the Maine law in force in every State in the Union;&#xD;
usually remarking, that it was a fearful invasion&#xD;
of our rights, and that if these fanatics were per-&#xD;
mitted, with their wild and extravagant opinions&#xD;
and notions, to govern us, our liberties would cease&#xD;
to be little else than an empty name-that" fanat-&#xD;
ics are governed rather by imagination than judg-&#xD;
inent." That if an individual saw proper to get&#xD;
drunk and continue in that condition until he chose&#xD;
to do differently, it was a matter that concerned&#xD;
and interested himself, and him only. Carefully&#xD;
evading an allusion to the mighty retinue of dis-&#xD;
case, wretchedness, 4sery, woe, debauchery, pau-&#xD;
perism, crime and d$ath that followed in the train&#xD;
of this unbridled liberty of getting drunk at pleas-&#xD;
nrc.&#xD;
Leblond was amply skilled in the use of the&#xD;
weapons of that most detestable character-the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7936-00000025"/>&#xD;
demagogue; and was in addition, a ~hrewd, saga~&#xD;
cious, and far-seeing politician, lie was, literally,&#xD;
all things to all men. While he was carrying&#xD;
around his money and depositing it in the taverns&#xD;
and groceries, for the wicked and abominable pur-&#xD;
pose of treating his friends upon election day, and&#xD;
thereby indirectly, if not directly, buying votes, he&#xD;
was cautioning those with whom he left the money,&#xD;
to be exceedingly careful that the old deacons, and&#xD;
certain others whom he supposed would reprobate&#xD;
that practice, should know nothing about his lib-&#xD;
erality, lest they might use it against him in cer-&#xD;
tain quarters.&#xD;
When he came in contact with the sober, virtu-&#xD;
ous, and better portion of community, he professed&#xD;
to detest dissipation in all its various forms-said&#xD;
he would occasionally take a dram, but not often&#xD;
-was actually opposed to the practice of tippling&#xD;
-thought tippling begat drunkenness; that drunk-&#xD;
enness ought to be, by law, severely punished as a&#xD;
crime. His close observation of men enabled him&#xD;
to determine with unerring certainty, whether he&#xD;
could talk temperance, or anti-temperance; and&#xD;
always suited himself to the occasion. We find&#xD;
him making it convenient to be in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood of a temperance meeting where he had sent&#xD;
one of his satellites, who called him as he was ri-&#xD;
ding by. Leblond stopped, tied his horse, an(l&#xD;
went into the crowd; and aftem' having been in-&#xD;
formed, by his friend who had invited him to stop,&#xD;
&#xD;
g&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
that all were temperance men, and that he could&#xD;
with safety discourse temperance sentiment, he&#xD;
went on to remark, that he had heard some men&#xD;
claim that it was an improper abridgement of our&#xD;
liberties to restrain us from immoderate drinking,&#xD;
but that was all consummate nonsense. The pub-&#xD;
lic had rights-society had interests that must not&#xD;
be overlooked. We had laws for the prevention&#xD;
of profanity and the violation of the Sabbath-Li-&#xD;
bel-a thousand and one other crimes and offen-&#xD;
ces, which the good of community required should&#xD;
he prohibited, and yet those laws were universally&#xD;
regarded as good and wholesome-as laws that&#xD;
tended to promote the best interests of the people;&#xD;
and therefore, were not only tolerated, but deemed&#xD;
essential to the welfare of community. And added,&#xD;
if it could be shown that drunkenness was an of-&#xD;
fence against society, (and no sane man doubted&#xD;
it,) then it was not an invasion of our liberties to&#xD;
restrain intemperance.&#xD;
Leblond then went into a very learned discus-&#xD;
sion of the difference between natural liberty-that&#xD;
which man enjoyed before the organization of so-&#xD;
ciety-and civil liberty, which grew out of his re-&#xD;
lations to mankind. Admitted that a man had, in a&#xD;
state of nature, before society was formed, a right&#xD;
to do what he chose, or desired; but when he enter~&#xD;
ed into the compact, he voluntarily gave up and sur-&#xD;
rendered that part of his natural liberty that con-&#xD;
flicted with the good of community, or'the rights of oth-&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
Accidents&#xD;
Somethucs combine to cast a shade of doubt&#xD;
Upon the innocent.       colma~?,&#xD;
LEMUEL HAMLIN, the convict, was about the me~&#xD;
ridian of life, and had been, from early boyhood.&#xD;
remarkable for his habits of industry and sobriety.&#xD;
He had, at about the period of twelve years of age,&#xD;
become a church member, aiul for nearly thirty&#xD;
years lived strictly xvithin the canons of the order&#xD;
and precepts ef the Bible; and had, therefore, in&#xD;
the community in which he lived, a character above&#xD;
reproach. The malevolent tongue of slander had&#xD;
never dared asperse his fair fame; *and though in&#xD;
the midst of affluence and the various comforts&#xD;
and conveniences that await upon wealth, he made&#xD;
no display-no pomp, no flourish; but was kind&#xD;
and amiable in his intercourse towards all with&#xD;
whom he came in contact in the various relations&#xD;
of life; and hence, even the shafts of envy failed&#xD;
to reach him. Having obtained considerable cc-&#xD;
lebrity and distinction at the bar, he was about&#xD;
permitting his name to be used as a candidate for&#xD;
the State Senate, at the time the suspicion of hav-&#xD;
ing murdered his brother began to attach to him.&#xD;
&#xD;
'The father of Ilamlini had died tea years pre~&#xD;
vious to the period of which we are now writing;&#xD;
and left, at his deceased, a large estate to be divided&#xD;
equally between Lemuel and his younger bi~other,&#xD;
Joseph, whom, as we have seen, was poisoned.&#xD;
Lemuel married early, and though he posSessed&#xD;
personal attractions of no ordinary character-su..&#xD;
l)erior talents, and no inconsiderable amount of&#xD;
wealth, (most of the latter, it is true, in the fa-&#xD;
tare,) yet with the position these advantages neces~&#xD;
~arily gave him, lie selected his wife from the more&#xD;
obse are walks of life ; remarking to a friend, at the&#xD;
time, that more than nine-tenths of the town and&#xD;
city girls had their hearts entirely covered with sic~&#xD;
atriecs by arrows shot from Cupid's quiver, long&#xD;
before they reached womanhood, that lie there-&#xD;
fore preferred a virgin heart, that he might have&#xD;
domestic peace and comfort; that many of them&#xD;
were rat her quixotic, and would acquire more time&#xD;
and patience to tame, than he had either leisure&#xD;
or inclination to devote to that subject; that it&#xD;
was easier to stimulate the intellect and develop&#xD;
it, than to give new directions to the moral facul-&#xD;
ties.&#xD;
The union of Lemuel Hamlin and his wife was&#xD;
one of affection. No sinister motive weighed on&#xD;
either ~side in determining in favor of this happy&#xD;
coaneThon. It was formed with the single view&#xD;
of attaining domestic happiness; that which Dr.&#xD;

"flomestie happiness Vthon oniy bliss&#xD;
Of Paradise, that has survived the fall ~"&#xD;
No discordant sounds were heard around that&#xD;
hearth, All was peace, love, devotion, with all&#xD;
those ten thousand little kind acts and attentions&#xD;
which in their aggregate go very far in making up&#xD;
the sum total of domestic comfort.&#xD;
His two eldest children were girls-~one seven-~&#xD;
teen, the other fifteen; both beautiful, sprightly.~&#xD;
and intelligent; and were, at tue com.menccinent&#xD;
of his trouble, finishing their e(iucation at a dis-&#xD;
tant school. his remaining three were boys, one&#xD;
thirteen and the other two younger.&#xD;
Conscious of his iiinocence, he did not inform&#xD;
his daughters of his perilous condition until after&#xD;
his trial was over. Though the circumstances coim&#xD;
nected with the charge, were positively suspicious,&#xD;
he apprehended no danger of conviction, and&#xD;
hoped to be able, before the period assigned for&#xD;
the trial should arrive, to explain some of the&#xD;
more mysterious circumstances. Yet he knew not&#xD;
how, nor could he begin to divine how to account&#xD;
for the most extraordinary fact, of having about&#xD;
his person, a phial containing a small quantity of&#xD;
deadly poison which, upon post mortem examina-~&#xD;
tior~, was discovered by medical skill to be identi-&#xD;
cally the same as that which was found in the&#xD;
stomach of young Hamlin.&#xD;

Sooi~ after his conviction he wrote to his absent&#xD;

"Mv DEAR J)~ueuT~Rs&#xD;

received them in turn,-&#xD;
In all the silent man]iness of ~iicf.''&#xD;
He conversed coolly to his family, for some time;&#xD;
but when he alluded to his (lenuse on the follow-&#xD;
ing day, his daughters gave vent to a pent up ag-&#xD;
ony intones-&#xD;
So madly shrill, SO piercing Wi[d,&#xD;
that the father, no longer ablo to control his infelt&#xD;
pangs, proposed invoking heavenly aid,-.-kneeled&#xD;
amid the clanking of his chains with his family&#xD;
around him, in the deepest devotional feeling.&#xD;
~)Payed as follows:&#xD;
" IJEAATENLY FATHER; thou erderest all tlui~ws&#xD;

arc inscruta1ble ~nd past finding out. Thou, who&#xD;
knowest all things, kn owest that I am innocent of&#xD;

deep affliction--this terrible cal amity-to come&#xD;
upon thy servant. Sustain and support him un-&#xD;
dei' the weight of this fearful infliction. Thou in&#xD;
thy holy book, hast taught us that all things work&#xD;
together for the good of those who love and serve&#xD;
thee~ Increase our faith, and euakle us to rely&#xD;
&#xD;
with entire confidence upon thy sacred promises.&#xD;
Enable us to realize that this visitation is a blessing&#xD;
in disguise, and is meant to save. Sustain this af-&#xD;
flicted and distressed family, and forbid, Almighty&#xD;
and merciful Father, that at the great day of final&#xD;
retribution, one of this number shall be found want-&#xD;
ing in any of the virtues of thy saints. Be a hus-&#xD;
band to the widow, and a father to the fatherless.&#xD;
Save them from sin. Throw around them the&#xD;
broad ~gis of thy saving grace, and enable them&#xD;
to feel the necessity of a continual application of&#xD;
the blood of a crucified and risen Redeemer. In&#xD;
the name of thy beloved Son, save them from the&#xD;

through the merits of Christ. Amen."&#xD;
After the family arose, the youngest little boy,&#xD;
about six years old continued upon his knees, with&#xD;
his eyes closed and his little hands clasped, while&#xD;
the tears were trickling down his infantile face, he&#xD;
exclaimed, with great fervency: "Oh, Dod, ma&#xD;
says you opened a prison and let Peter go way.&#xD;
Open this big jail door, and let my poor pa go&#xD;
home; do, Dod; oh, do!"&#xD;

attempt to delineate it, but leave our reader to~&#xD;
draw upon his imagination for the occurrences of&#xD;
the next half hour.&#xD;
Some three hours before day the youngest daugh-&#xD;
ter and three little boys took an affectionate leave&#xD;
of their father aiid returned home. The mother&#xD;
and oldest daughter remained with him without&#xD;
eating or sleeping, until sometime the next day,&#xD;
and till the Sheriff appeared to dress him in the&#xD;
habiliments of the grave.&#xD;
As soon as the younger members of the family&#xD;
had left, he turned to his wife, anti thus. addressed&#xD;
her-~&#xD;
"My dear; our attachment has been long, deep,&#xD;
ardent, uninterrupted. It is now about to close&#xD;
forever. There are many things T would like to&#xD;
say, hut the time allotted me is too short. It i~&#xD;
said that-&#xD;
Endure an(l -~-i~ie,&#xD;
is all of life; but that is not correct. There are&#xD;
many thing's in life to make it desirable. I have&#xD;
strong desires to live-not that I am afraid to die.&#xD;
Death has no terrors that I cannot face with as&#xD;
much composure as I could contemplate a beauti-&#xD;
ful landscape. 'It is appointed to man once to&#xD;
die.' If he has 'fought a good fight,' it can mat-&#xD;
ter but little to him, when, or under what circum~&#xD;
stances, he is called to shake hands with time.&#xD;
The only thing that could induce one lingering re-&#xD;
gret, is our relations with. others. My only desire&#xD;
&#xD;
to live at this time, is for the benefit of my fam-&#xD;
ily; and I sometimes fear that even that desire is a&#xD;
djstrust in the goodness of God. But when I recur&#xD;
to those dear, dear little boys; oh! how rhy heart&#xD;
bleeds! They have been the joy and the pride of&#xD;
my existence. Ihave watched their expanding in-&#xD;
tellects and their moral development with a solici-&#xD;
tude none have known; and now, we separate for-&#xD;
ever! This may be intended by a kind Proyidence&#xD;
to save. By the erring hand of indulgence I might&#xD;
have laid the foundation for their ultimate ruin,&#xD;
temporal and eternal. Exert all a mother's influ-&#xD;
ence over their. tender, ductile minds. You may&#xD;
make them what you will. May God grant you&#xD;
may make them what you ought. Impart to them&#xD;
your own high and holy notions of virtue-of prin~&#xD;
ciple-of integrity. Teach them that to depart&#xD;
from these, is to be like&#xD;
"A boat at midnight, sent alone&#xD;
TO drift llPOfl a inoonle~s Sea."&#xD;
Put your trust in the widow's God. Let your con-&#xD;
fidence in his promises be implicit. Let not a&#xD;
(ioubt pervade your s~oul. Oh ! what would now&#xD;
be my insupportable condition but for the solaces&#xD;
of religion-for faith in Christ-&#xD;
"lie taught us how to live; and (oh! too high&#xD;
~ price o~ knowledge.) taught us how to die."&#xD;

trhe Sheriff had been standing at the door, an un-&#xD;

willing to break in upon the solemnity of the -sep-&#xD;

daughter, with less emotion than could have been&#xD;
anticipated; while they both svvooned-fell to the&#xD;

On entering the room, the Sheriff took a seat&#xD;

guilty-that all had hoped that some development&#xD;
would have disclosed his innocence before the fa-&#xD;

" That," replied Hamlin, " avails me but little&#xD;

have failed to restore me to niy rights, or remove&#xD;

"if Judge Jones had been sober," remarked thc&#xD;
Sheriff,)' you would not have becit convicted."&#xD;
"If he had not charged the Jury at all," contain~&#xD;
ued Hamlin, "they could not have hesitated a mo-&#xD;
ment as to my innocence ; but if he had charged&#xD;
the law as it is laid down in the books, they would&#xD;
have returned a verdict of not guilty without leav-&#xD;
ing their box. But I was astonished that twelve&#xD;
as good men as composed that jury, did not utterly&#xD;
disregard his ruling, notwithstanding he told them&#xD;
that their oaths and affirmations bound them to&#xD;
take the law to be what the Court ruled, which was&#xD;
as false as the rest of the charge. The law makes&#xD;
the jury the judges of the law as well as the facts,&#xD;
and had Jones become sober before the court ad-&#xD;
journed, and made acquainted with the character&#xD;
of his charge, I have no doubt he would have&#xD;
granted a new trial, without argument. My fate&#xD;
and his conduct upon that investigation, will annoy&#xD;
hirn'till the latest period of his earthly existence, if&#xD;
not infinitely beyond it."&#xD;
"Yes, yes ;" said the Sheriff, "you have fallen&#xD;

He was now dressed in his grave clothes and&#xD;
taken to the scaffold, through the living mass of'&#xD;
human beings, who had congregated from every&#xD;

Turning again to the multitude, he continued:&#xD;
"I declare before God, I am wholly ignorant of the&#xD;
manner in xvhich the phial containing prussic acid,&#xD;
came into my possession. Some wicked person&#xD;
present at the bar-supper, must have placed it in&#xD;
my pocket, while he contemplated precisely the state&#xD;
of things which have resulted. The guilty has&#xD;
gone unwhipt of justice; while I, quite as inno.~&#xD;
cent as the victim of the diabolical deed, who now&#xD;
sleeps his last sleep, am about to die for the crime.&#xD;
I have a distinct impression as to who is the guilty&#xD;
wretch, but I might do him injustice; and shall,&#xD;
therefore, decline to give that impression to- the&#xD;
world. I would not at this moment exchange sit-&#xD;
uations with him. And let me now assure him,&#xD;
that before many weeks shall have passed, Cod&#xD;
will avenge this base wrong-vindicate my char -&#xD;
acter and save my family from the foul imputa-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
At this moment, Jerome Jenkins, who for many&#xD;
years, had been the competitor of Lemuel Ham&#xD;
lin at the bar, gave a piercing scream, that attrac-&#xD;
ted the attention of all, present-fell to the&#xD;
ground near the foot of the structure upon which&#xD;
&#xD;
64&#xD;
&#xD;
Hamlin stood, and was carried by his friends to his&#xD;
lodgings.&#xD;
For the first time since Hamlin left the prison,&#xD;
he now became pale, and exhibited deep emotion.&#xD;
He had witnessed the fall of Jenkins, and had&#xD;
seen him borne from the ground. He, however,&#xD;
soon rallied, and remarked, that intemperance had&#xD;
brought this work of destruction upon him ,though&#xD;
he had ~ot tasted liquor for very many years. He&#xD;
hoped that all who heard him would profit by his&#xD;
misfortune, and wage a war of extermination&#xD;
against tippling and intemperance.&#xD;
The crowd had now become impetuous, and&#xD;
made a rush to the stand, with a view of releasing&#xD;
Ilamlin, but were repelled by a strong military&#xD;
guard, at the point of the bayonet.&#xD;
The Sheriff here communicated to him that he&#xD;
had but five minutes to live, took leave of him, and&#xD;
was about drawing the cap over the eyes of Ham-&#xD;
un, when a man was seen in the distance, coming&#xD;
in the direction of the place of execution, as swiftly&#xD;
as his exhausted steed could bear him forward,&#xD;
crying, as he~came,-"hold! hold!! hold!!!" The&#xD;
messenger, as he ran his foaming animal into the&#xD;
midst of the dense mass of people, threw himself&#xD;
from its back, and was immediately upon the scaf-&#xD;
fold in conversation with the Sheriff.&#xD;

Jerome Jenkins had been carried home, where&#xD;
he remained delirious for several clays, with an&#xD;
occasional lucid interval. During his lucid mo-&#xD;
ments, he would constantly talk of the cruel fate&#xD;
of the 1I~m1ins, but when in delirium he would in-&#xD;
sist that he, with his own hand, had murdered them;&#xD;
and in the most wild and incoherent manner talk&#xD;
about his struggles at the bar with Lemuel, and&#xD;
the bright and glorious future that axvaited Joseph,&#xD;
had he lived. And then, at the top of his deep,&#xD;
sonorious voice, that carried dismay to every heart,&#xD;
exclaim, "Pluto, I see you! Why don't you take&#xD;
the devil out of my room? He is after me. help I&#xD;
help!! help I I1" While it would require three or&#xD;
four athletic men to keep him in bed.&#xD;
Jenkins and Hamlin practiced in their profession&#xD;
at the same bar, for some twenty years. They&#xD;
started in the profession about the same period,&#xD;
and at the time of commencing, both were in mdi-&#xD;
&#xD;
gent circumstances. Jiamlin's father, soon after&#xD;
his admission to the bar, put him into the posses-&#xD;
sion of a handsome property, to which by inJustry,&#xD;
economy, and careful management, he had made&#xD;
large accessions.&#xD;
Jenkins, stimulated by the thought of Hamlin 's&#xD;
becoming rich, embarked in a hazardous enter-&#xD;
~)rize; and he, too, after a few years, and a fortui-&#xD;
tons turn or two of the wheel of fortune, became&#xD;
wealthy. So that at the death of Joseph Hamlin,&#xD;
they were each in affluence, and were beginning&#xD;
to entertain political aspirations, and both accord~&#xD;
iiigly, had their names announced as candidates&#xD;
for the State Senate.&#xD;
When admitted to the bai', Jenkins and Hamlin&#xD;
were members of a temperance organization, and&#xD;
with the strictest fidelity each kept his pledge until&#xD;
Jenkins began to feel an inclination to court public&#xD;
favor with reference to political promotion, when he&#xD;
violated his pledge, and was finally cut loose from&#xD;
the society of which he was a member, by th~&#xD;
unanimous vote of the association, as unworthy of&#xD;
their confidence.&#xD;
Feeling now, no restraint, and mir~gling frec1y,.~&#xD;
and indeed, almost constantly, among the sove-&#xD;
reign people, of all classes and conditions, (for he&#xD;
was resolved to win,) he was incessantly exposed&#xD;
to the, danger of treating and being treated;&#xD;
and whenever exposed, invariably yielded to the&#xD;
temptation, until among the more sober and tei~~&#xD;

p crate portion of the community, he was regarded&#xD;
as an inebriate-gone beyond the hope of redemp-&#xD;
tion; while his drunken associates only consid~&#xD;
ered' him a clever-souled fellow, who could drink&#xD;
or let it alone, at his pleastire.\ But he found it&#xD;
much easier to drink than to let it alone. Yet he, as&#xD;
is universally the case, had not, even begun to sus-,&#xD;
pect that he was sliding notwithstanding lie was&#xD;
very near the base of the declivity.&#xD;
Some of his friends, (and he had many among&#xD;
the best men of the country,) would occasionally&#xD;
rr~odestly intimate to him that he was in danger,&#xD;
but Jenkins would seem not to understand the ab&#xD;
fusion until it was made tqo palpable, and then&#xD;
would repel the idea of his becoming intemperate&#xD;
as utterly impos~ihle and not to be contemplated&#xD;
for a moment. The recklessliess of such men, who&#xD;
can doubt, had much to do in originating the say-&#xD;
ing among the ancients, that " whoiri the gods&#xD;
wish to destroy they first make mad ?"&#xD;
On the evening of the death of Joseph Ilamlin,&#xD;
I&#xD;
the bar had met at one of the hotels of tii~ village,&#xD;
for the purpose of knocking oW or rather washing&#xD;
off, the sharp points created during a recent term&#xD;
of their Court; and Joseph hlamlin being a law&#xD;
student, and quite a favorite, had an invitation to&#xD;
be present, and met with them.&#xD;

liamlin was majestic, and in intellect was vastly&#xD;
above mediocrity; and had the refining and polish..&#xD;
ing touches of a finished education. His brothel'&#xD;
had bestowed much attention upon his moral and&#xD;
mental training, and until within the last twelve&#xD;
months previous to this evening, he had been con-&#xD;
sidered a paragon of excellence and moral worth.&#xD;
During his collegiate course he had stood' at the&#xD;
head of his class, and graduated with the highest&#xD;
honors the institution could confer upon him. He&#xD;
returned home, and with an intermission of but a&#xD;
few days, entered upon the study of the law with&#xD;
his brother. lIe had fixed his standard high. Had&#xD;
taken onc or two of the first lawyers of the Re-&#xD;
public as his model, with a firm resolution to attain&#xD;
to their excellence. During the first twelve months&#xD;
of his studies, Coke, Plowden and Blackstone, were&#xD;
his constant and only companions, but about the&#xD;
close of that period, some of his duties as Clerk in&#xD;
his brother's office, brought him frequently, for&#xD;
some time, in contact with Jenkins, for whom he&#xD;
formed a' warm attachment, and at the same time&#xD;
some fondness for the "flowing bowl." His brother,&#xD;
who regarded moral character as paramount, and&#xD;
of the utrriost importance to a young man about&#xD;
to enter upon the legal profession, had been notic-&#xD;
mug, witl~ the deepest anxiety, his declension, and&#xD;
had embraced every opportunity of impressing&#xD;
upon his mind the necessity of the strictest tem-&#xD;

&#xD;
he had chosen as the theatre of his future hopes;&#xD;
now and then directing his attention to distin-&#xD;
guished members of the bar whose sun had set be-&#xD;
hind a cloud because of this vice. Lemuel 11am-&#xD;
un's anxiety had becop§ie chronic, and he resolved&#xD;
to terminate it by breaking up the intimacy that&#xD;
existed between Joseph and Jcnkins~ He there-&#xD;
fore sought his brother's society, and o~ what he&#xD;
regarded as a suitable occasion, insisted upon his&#xD;
quitting the company of Jenkins, and urged as a&#xD;
reason, that he was immoral, reckless, and unprin-&#xD;
cipled, and was fast verging to the drunkard's fate,&#xD;
and that his association was having a demoralizing&#xD;
effect upon him. But Joseph, unwilling' to believe he&#xD;
stood in need of such admonitions, very readily at-&#xD;
tributed his brother's views of .3 enkin's character&#xD;
to the acrimonious feeling provoked by conflicts at&#xD;
the bar, and ~he political campaign just opening.&#xD;
in which they were competitors, and both more or&#xD;
less jealous of each other's power with the people~&#xD;
It was for the purpose of throwing a restraint&#xD;
around Joseph, that Lemuel was induced to attend&#xD;
the fatal bar supper.&#xD;
Jenkins had been sick for about two weeks, and&#xD;
for the most part of that time his case was con-&#xD;
sidered, by his medical advisers, as desperate. his&#xD;
fever having now, to some extent, abated, he was&#xD;
again rational. After enjoying, for some eighteen&#xD;
hours, an ~incloudccl jptellect, " a sou~id ~nd dis-&#xD;
posing mind and memory," and supposing himself&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
i&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
in ext rem is, began seriously to think of the "leap&#xD;
in the dark ;" "duly made and executed" his will.&#xD;
By this will he disinherited each of his four sons,&#xD;
if after they should respectively arrive at the age&#xD;
of twelve, they should "be known to drink aleholic&#xD;
liquors." And then added this singular clause:&#xD;
"not that a very few drains would be a great det-&#xD;
riment to my children, but drunkenness is nearly&#xD;
certain to ensue ; then follows idleness, profanity,&#xD;
and kindrid vices in the trein, and hence this&#xD;
clan se."&#xD;
After completing his will and disposing of all&#xD;
his mundane possessions, he sent for a clergyman,&#xD;
who soon arrived, and was seated by his bed-side.&#xD;
A few moments having in silence elapsed, Jenkins&#xD;
remarked to the manof God, " You l~Crceive, my&#xD;
dear sir, that my sands are nearly run out. I have&#xD;
now to finish in a few bricf hours, a work, for the&#xD;
completion of which a whole lifetime is too short&#xD;

"During the past two years I have permitted&#xD;
myself to fall into that most de~t~'uctive of all vices&#xD;

was fond of either the taste or effect of liquor, but&#xD;
in mixing with, the people I was Yrequently invited&#xD;
to drink, and) drank for no other reason than that I&#xD;
lacked courage to say no, and then in turn, treated&#xD;
and of course drank; and thus in a few months, if&#xD;
I did not acquire a fondness&amp;amp; for both the taste and&#xD;
effect, I acquired the habit of drinking frequently,&#xD;
and was ruined.before I was aware of the ground&#xD;
I occupied. If I possessed the ability to reform,&#xD;
which was doubtful, when a candidate for an im-&#xD;
portant office in a drinking community, all will ad-&#xD;

I drank, and continued to drink, excessively. But&#xD;
I attended that bar-supper, with a heart as free&#xD;
from guilt as it had ever been since my earliest&#xD;
recollection. After having been there for some&#xD;
time, drinking freely, I conceived the fiendish idea&#xD;
of attempting to) strike down the character and&#xD;
moral standing of Lemuel Hamhin. I observed he&#xD;
drank no liquor, and as I drank immoderately, it&#xD;
occurred to me he would be likely to use my in-&#xD;
temperate habits against mc in the coming cam-&#xD;
paign; and I, therefore, went to the work of man-&#xD;
ufacturing an offset against his charge, and while&#xD;
revolving the matter in my mind, it struck me with&#xD;
irresistible force that if I could administer to Jo~&#xD;
seph ilamhin a very minute portion of poison-suf-&#xD;
ficient to produce nausia, and make it a marked&#xD;
effort at poisoning, and then fix the suspicion on&#xD;

was with much difficulty that I could get my qwn&#xD;
consent, but after drinking often and freely of the&#xD;
accursed liquor that filled the board,. I quietly pas-&#xD;
sed out of the hall, unobserved-returned to my&#xD;
house, procured a small phial containing prussic&#xD;
acid, I had obtained several months previously,&#xD;
for pharmaceutical purposes-returned to the room&#xD;
of conviviality and dissipation, and seated myself&#xD;
between Lemuel and Joseph; and while Lemuel&#xD;
was engaged in conversation with a gentleman&#xD;
on his left, I potired the contents of the phial into&#xD;
Joseph's glass, lie being by this time so much intox-&#xD;
icated that he was scarcely conscious of any thing&#xD;
that was transpiring about him, and immediately&#xD;
put my hand around behind Lemuel and placed&#xD;
the phial, withoutbeing noticed, into his coat pock-&#xD;

drinking, but I had poured more of the fatal drug&#xD;
into the glass than I bad intended; I attempted by&#xD;
an apparent accidental jostle, to knock the glass&#xD;
from his hand; but being quite as much under the&#xD;
influence of liquor as he was, I, consequently,&#xD;
missed my aim-he drank it to the bottom. Soon,&#xD;
a deathly sickness seized him, and he fell to the&#xD;
floor.&#xD;

moment the phial fell from his 1)ocket, which was&#xD;

whispering in his ear, "it had better be carefully&#xD;

last few days, to which we have invariably resp on-&#xD;
ded, most certainly not, unless he has infinitely less&#xD;
confidence in the virtue and intelligence of the&#xD;
people than we supposed. It cannot be that a man&#xD;
steeped to the chin in infamy, and bed aubed with&#xD;
the slime of drunkenness and debauchery, will ask&#xD;
a virtuous and intelligent community to endorse&#xD;
his judicial course, and by their suffrage retain&#xD;
him in the high and responsible position he has so&#xD;
thoroughly disgraced.&#xD;
"An ordinary case of murder is mitigated homi-&#xD;
cide, when compared with this judicial murder of&#xD;
Hamlin. The pinching want of a destitute family&#xD;
may occasionally be plead in extenuation of the&#xD;
crime of the misguided wrctch who kills for gain.&#xD;
Avarice, revenge, and the various motives which&#xD;
prompt the murderous act, may, and frequently&#xD;
have, mitigating circumstances; but what imagi-&#xD;
nation so fertile as to conceive of an apology for&#xD;
this murder by Judge Jones?"&#xD;
The above publication had escaped the obser-&#xD;
vation of Judge Jones, until it was sent him, by&#xD;
some friend, some weeks after the issue of the pa-&#xD;
per containing it. He had seen numerous attacks&#xD;
upon him, but none that roused him like this. lie&#xD;
read it ever attentively several times. His first&#xD;
impulse was, to meet the editor and chastise him&#xD;
personally, but a few moment's reflection enabled&#xD;
him to determine that a personal rencountre with&#xD;
the 'editor would make a bad matter worse. While&#xD;
&#xD;
attack upon those who were traducing him would&#xD;
appease his wrath and vindicate his wounded pride,&#xD;
it might add to the dangers already clustering&#xD;
about hi~ political hopes. His next thought was&#xD;
to institute his action for libel, and make him re-&#xD;
spond in damages; but again it occurred that the&#xD;
editor was wholly irresponsible. When he finally&#xD;
determined to defer the matter until he had an op-&#xD;
portunity of consulting with his friend Jewett, to&#xD;
whom he wrote the following letter;&#xD;
Mv DEAR JEWETT&#xD;
"You will please find, enclosed, a slanderous&#xD;
attack upon me, which I have clipped from a num-&#xD;
her of the Jeffersonian, published a few weeks since,&#xD;
concerning the Hamlin trial, which you have doubt-&#xD;
less seen. For baseness and malignant feeling it&#xD;
surpasses any of the Junius letters. lit annoys me&#xD;
no little, and I am wholly unable to determine what&#xD;
disposition to make of it. Is it the production of&#xD;
the editor, or some other political scullion, who&#xD;
has more responsibility and probably more chara&amp;amp;&#xD;
ter than the editor, and who thus expects to attack&#xD;
me with impunity, by skulking behind the misera~~&#xD;

that contemptible sheet?&#xD;

this crisis of my political career. My defeat, at&#xD;
this time, would be the death-knell to my hopes;&#xD;
and with the prostration of my political hopes, my&#xD;
happiness, also, for I have no taste for the tame&#xD;
pursuits of professional life. 1 had in my mind's~&#xD;
eye the position I now occupy, when I first entered&#xD;
upon a legal course of study. It was the dream&#xD;
of my youth-the aspiration of mature years, and&#xD;
the culminating point of my ambition.&#xD;
"I use freedom in writing to you, for ' talking to&#xD;
a friend,' we are told, 'is only thinking aloud.'&#xD;
"I have flattered myself I could become u~efuI?&#xD;
if not distinguished~ upon the Bench. And now,&#xD;
to have my fondest aspirations thus nipped in the&#xD;
bud-to be thus sent back to the private walks of&#xD;
life, degraded and forever disgraced, with a great~&#xD;
gulf carved out-beyond which I cannot pass-be-&#xD;
tween me and the ohj ect for which I have lived,&#xD;
and upon which I have set my heart, is absolutely&#xD;
insupportable. The bare thought wrings anguish&#xD;
frona~my soul. The dereliction of duty, if I have&#xD;
been guilty of any, will not, in fact, be increased&#xD;
by my defeat; nor will my election actually&#xD;
lessen it, yet success covers a multitude of sins,&#xD;
while failure augments them. Thompson, though&#xD;
not a politician, understood this subject when he&#xD;
wrote-&#xD;
"It is 5UCC~S5 that colors all in life;&#xD;
Success makes fools admired, makes villains honest."&#xD;
What 8hall I do? Meet him and compel a retrac-&#xD;
&#xD;
Lion, or punish him on the spot? Or, shall I reply&#xD;
through the press? This might be objectionable,&#xD;
as it would elicit, through the public prints, a full&#xD;
discussion of the entire circumstances connected&#xD;
with the Hamlin affair, which would be unpleasant,&#xD;
not to say dangerous, at this time. Perhaps I had&#xD;
better bring an action against the rascal, even if it&#xD;
should be thought advisable to discontinue it after&#xD;
the election, as that would probably put a quietus&#xD;
upon him for the present. Let me hear from you&#xD;
by return mail. I am, my dear Sir,&#xD;
Your ob't. serv't,&#xD;
J. L. JONES."&#xD;
A. P. Jewett was, at this period, a zealous and&#xD;
eloquent advocate of the Maine Law, but ~ad&#xD;
formed a strong attachment for Jones, personally,&#xD;
and entertained a high opinion of his legal ability&#xD;
and judicial talents, and had, therefore, determined&#xD;
to give him his most cordial and energetic support.&#xD;
At the earliest possible moment after the recep.~.&#xD;
tion of the above note from the Judge, he replied&#xD;
as follows:&#xD;
"MY DEAR JONES:.&#xD;
"The subject in your communication, had&#xD;
cost me much thought and reflection, for sometime&#xD;
previous to receiving your favor, and it has not&#xD;
been without difficulty that I have been able to de.&#xD;

finally concluded your better policy will bc to treat&#xD;
it, for the present, at least, with silent contempt;&#xD;
and when an allusion is made to this and similar&#xD;
charges, your friends must insist that it is the want&#xD;
of responsibility in the editor of the Jeffersonian&#xD;
that saved him from eondign punishment.&#xD;
"And a very short time hence, the ground must&#xD;
be assumed in different parts of the State, simul-&#xD;
taneously, that you are cruelly persecuted-that&#xD;
a strong disposition prevails in certain quarters, to&#xD;
victimize you-that the charge is without founda-&#xD;
tion-is intended to strike you down, for the simple&#xD;
reason that you're not a fanatic-will not advo-&#xD;
cate a prohibitory law, but will occasionally indulge&#xD;
in ~. glass of brandy. If this course is prudently&#xD;
adopted, and the matter carefully managed, it can&#xD;
be made to recoil with powerful force; and if so,&#xD;
your election, by a large and very decided majority,&#xD;
is rendered certain.&#xD;
"You are well aware of my position upon the&#xD;
temperance question. I am in favor of prohibition;&#xD;
yet, so anxious am I for your success, I would make&#xD;
any reasonable sacrifice to accomplish it. In the&#xD;
course of some four or five days, I will make a tour&#xD;
through the State and moderate our temperance&#xD;
friends, as much as in my power, and occasionally&#xD;
furnish the opposers of the Maine Law with a few&#xD;
items that may h~nefit you essentially.&#xD;
'Very truly yours,&#xD;
A. P. JEWETT."&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
A few days previous to the election, in pursuance&#xD;
of Jewett's plan for operation, articles appeared&#xD;
thi'ough the State, in all the different papers friendly&#xD;
'to Jones, charging that a most unholy persecution&#xD;
had been waged by the Maine Law advocates&#xD;
against Judge Jones; the object of which was to&#xD;
rouse the liquor inthience, nor is it necessary to&#xD;
add that it worked lik~ a charm.&#xD;
As our narrative would be incomplete without&#xD;
a specimen of the political writers of those times,&#xD;
we will copy, ntire, an article which appeared in&#xD;
the Herald, a aper published in the Lastern part&#xD;
of the State:&#xD;
"Since the dawn of political warfare, no man&#xD;
has ever been required to pass through the fiery&#xD;
ordeal that has fallen to the lot of Judge Jones.&#xD;
We have always been in favor of fair, open, manly&#xD;
political struggles for principle; and will add, we&#xD;
care not how warmlyy such contests are conducted.&#xD;
We have ever believed that political parties neces-&#xD;
sarily grew out of human nature in organized so-&#xD;
ciety; that the existence of party is as unavoidable&#xD;
as necessary; hence we never expect to see party&#xD;
annihilated, neither in Republican, nor any other&#xD;
form of government, in the old or new world; nor&#xD;
do we think it desirable, if it were possible.&#xD;
"We ask, what would be the condition of our&#xD;
country if party did not exist? What would be-&#xD;
come of government? What would become of&#xD;
the country and the interests of the people, but for&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7936-00000044"/>&#xD;
86                     THfl UN3trS1~ JUflW.&#xD;
&#xD;
the lynx-eyed political editors and partisans? It&#xD;
is absolutely necessary, then, for the purity of the&#xD;
government, that there should be some person or&#xD;
persons sufficiently interested to watch every move&#xD;
of the governmental officials, and to discuss the&#xD;
propriety of every movement; ferret out their&#xD;
frauds and expose their lackes-their want of saga~&#xD;
city arid foresight. But for this watching-this fer~&#xD;
reting-out .-this investigation - government , of&#xD;
whatever character or complexion they may be,&#xD;
would soon fester, garigreen, and fall to pieces&#xD;
from their own inherent corruption, or become a&#xD;
most insupportable burden, rather than a blessing&#xD;
to the people. But, again, who is to sustain po-&#xD;
litical editors and political partizans, hut political&#xD;
parties? "The laborer is worthy of his hire," is a&#xD;
truism if stripped of its divinity, and that hire must&#xD;
come from partizan zeal or not at all. And hence&#xD;
we argue the necessity, as well as the wisdom, of&#xD;
party.&#xD;
"For the above reasons, with numerous others&#xD;
we might offer, we expect ever to be a warm and&#xD;
decided politician; ever willing to stand firm and&#xD;
immovable for the interest and measures of our&#xD;
party; believing, as we do, that the interest and&#xD;
welfare of our country are involved in the iiiterest&#xD;
and welfare of the party of which we have been&#xD;
a zealous member from our youth up. But we&#xD;
can never be tempted to assail private character,&#xD;
for the purpose of carrying - a. political measure,&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
however important it may be; and we certainly&#xD;
could not be induced to do it for the baser purpose&#xD;
of striking down a politic-al enemy.&#xD;
"I low different the course pursued by the perse~&#xD;
~. utors of our worthy and distinguished friend,&#xD;
Judge Jones? 1-us private character has been sifted&#xD;
and held up to the public gaze, distorted and black-&#xD;
~mcd so ~ not to be recognized by hk friends ~x-&#xD;
cept as a mo~t ridiculous caricature. Even the&#xD;
sanctity of the domestic hearth has been invaded&#xD;
by these worse than hyenas, who are yelping upon&#xD;
his track! And for no other reason than that he&#xD;
will not give in his adhesion to a prohibitory liquor&#xD;
law, and shout, frantic with fanaticism, to the ut-&#xD;
most capacity of his lungs, Maine Law.! Which&#xD;
we think, with due deference, ought to be dubbed&#xD;
the Maine folly. Such conduct is infamous beyond&#xD;
the power of language to characterize, and can&#xD;
have no other effect than to rouse the liberal of all&#xD;
parties, in support of the Judge. And we shall&#xD;
be most egregiously disappointed if the moderate&#xD;
and liberal of all parties do not rally around the&#xD;
staiidard of Judge Jones, to such an extent as to&#xD;
carry dismay into the ranks of these fanatics.&#xD;
"Who does not know that the best men among&#xD;
us are in the habit, now and then, of drinking a&#xD;
glass of liquor whenever they need it? And who&#xD;
does not know that it has neither injured them&#xD;
physically nor intellectually, nor has it incapaci-&#xD;
t~ted them for business."&#xD;

drunkard is the impersonation of audacity. The&#xD;
man who is base enough to manufacture and make&#xD;
such a charge against the Judge, is lost to shame.&#xD;
and deserves to have "ia~unoas" branded upon&#xD;

hope our friends will look closely to this 1natteI~&#xD;
lest he be literally lied out of the office he has~&#xD;
filled with so much credit to himself and advantage&#xD;
to the public.&#xD;
"We have the ho~or of a ~sonal qua~ntance&#xD;
with Judge Jones, and regard him as the best man&#xD;
upon our ticket, and feel 1)ound to contribute our&#xD;
utmost effort to promote his election, because of&#xD;
his qualifications and peculiar fitness for the posi..&#xD;
tiou~ And even if he lacked some of the essential&#xD;
qualifications for the bench, still we should support&#xD;
him, and support him with all the energy we are&#xD;
capable of putting forth, for the reason that great&#xD;
jnjustice has been done to the Judge. We are so&#xD;
constituted that when we see a man outraged, and&#xD;
the flood-gates of billingsgate let loose upon him,&#xD;
our sympathies are enli~t&amp;amp;d and our comba~tative-&#xD;
&#xD;
ness aroused, and would be more inclined to over~&#xD;
look imperfectioiis. We have frequently met him&#xD;
in the social circle, and around the festive board;&#xD;
and while we have never seen him drunk, we have&#xD;
never seen him refuse to take a glass when re-&#xD;
quested by a friend. He is endeared to his friends&#xD;
by every social tie. lie is none of your narrow-&#xD;
contracted, pinched-up, sanctimonious, long-faced,&#xD;
little seven-by-nine down-eastern puritans, but lib-&#xD;
eral to a fault, and generouui beyond his means;&#xD;
always manly, always candid and frank; no con-&#xD;
cealments to make, but always appears to be what&#xD;
he is. Again we would say to our friends, come&#xD;
to the rescue, and stamp the defamers of the Judge&#xD;
with falsehood."&#xD;
To the above article, a reply appeared in the&#xD;
next issue of the Journal, a paper printed in the&#xD;
same town, which, for the p~npose of giving both&#xD;
sides a hearing, we will copy:&#xD;
"The Herald, of last week, is out in an article&#xD;
of some length and considerable acrimony, in sup-&#xD;
port of Judge Joncs.&#xD;
"Our neighbor of the llerald~s first effort is, to&#xD;
create the impression that Jones is being most&#xD;
fiercely persecuted. We have but little doubt that&#xD;
the facts, recently made public, in connection with&#xD;
the trial of liamlin, are anything but agreeable to&#xD;
Judge Jones and his friends.&#xD;

TIlE L~NJUST JUDGI~.&#xD;
It would'~be quite as sensible for the criminal to&#xD;
charge the court, that was meeting out to him the&#xD;
reward of his infamy and his crime, with persecu-&#xD;
tion; though we confess it would be less politic.&#xD;
"Judge Jones is either guilty or innocent of the&#xD;
charge of sacrificing Ilamlin. If innocent, then&#xD;
he has a remedy in our courts of justice, which&#xD;
will make him abundantly whole, and forever si-&#xD;
lence his traducers. Why has he not already re-&#xD;
sorted to this means of redress, instead of allow~-&#xD;
ing his friends to raise the doleful howl of perse-&#xD;
cution? The- answer to this inquiry is easily anti-&#xD;
cipated. Jones could not enter court with "clean&#xD;
hands ;" and, consequently, would come out with&#xD;
a worse character than when he xvent in. lie is&#xD;
too familiar with courts of Justice to ask any in-&#xD;
vestigation of the grave charges that are now be-&#xD;
ing made against him in every portion of the&#xD;
State. Had there been no foundation for these&#xD;
attacks upon his character, they were grossly&#xD;
libelous, and no sooner had the charge been&#xD;
made than he would have instituted his ac-&#xD;
tion; and as often as reiterated, would lie have&#xD;
been seen seeking his remedy before the judicial&#xD;
tribunals of his country.&#xD;
"But why, we ask, does not the herald, and other&#xD;
sheets friendly to Judge Jones, positively deny&#xD;
that he was intoxicated upon the trial of that im~&#xD;
portent criminal cause? We have not seen a plain,&#xD;
positive denial of the charge, and we apprehend&#xD;
&#xD;
THE tTNJtTST JPiiGF~.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
it has not been made, for the only reason that it&#xD;
could not be. Is it persecution, then, to charge&#xD;
him with being incapable of discharging his duty*&#xD;
upon that trial? If it is, we plead guilty. If drunk~&#xD;
enness and debauchery are judicial virtues, he&#xD;
l)055055C5 them in an eminent degree. But if tem-&#xD;
perance and sobriety are requisite in a judge, then&#xD;
Jones is not fit for ti~e position. If to expose his&#xD;
drunkenness and debauchery, and urging the fact&#xD;
as a reason for regarding him as unfit for the bench,&#xD;
is "assailing private character," then we plead&#xD;
guilty to that charge. If charging him with hay-&#xD;
ing bacchanalian feasts at his own house, is "in-&#xD;
vading the sanctity of the domestic hearth," we&#xD;
pfcad guilty to that.&#xD;
"We have opposed Judge Jone's election, and&#xD;
we expect to continue that opposition until the last&#xD;
ballot is deposited in the box, not out of any unkind&#xD;
feeling towards him, for we have none, but for high-&#xD;
er and more holy reasons.&#xD;
"XYe agree with Jones in politics, and admit he&#xD;
possesses splendid talents, and quite as much legal&#xD;

icated, and their is no remedy. It is worse than&#xD;
madness to advocate the claims of such a man.&#xD;
We never can consent to entrust the adjudication&#xD;
of questions involving such momentous interests&#xD;
to a man, admitted by his friends to be constantly,&#xD;
more or less, under the influeiiee of liquor. Infi-&#xD;
nitely sooner would we prefer a sober man upon&#xD;
the bench who differs with us politically; for in&#xD;
h~s hands, the liberty and the lives of citizens would&#xD;
at least be safe, however he might differ with us&#xD;
in relation to the character and rights of corpora-&#xD;
tions. Our fealty to party has iiever been ques-&#xD;
tioned; yet our fidelity to the people, to society, to&#xD;
virtue,, to morality~ religion and the best interests&#xD;
of humanity, demand our Opposition to Judge Jones.&#xD;
We do it reluctantly, but we do it with the ap-&#xD;
proval of our conscience as well as our judgment&#xD;
"The Herald claims "the honor of a personal&#xD;
acquaintance with Judge Jones," and adds, that&#xD;
"while we have never seen him drunk, we have&#xD;
never seen him refuse to take a glass with a friend."&#xD;
Now, while no sober man acquainted with Judge&#xD;
Jones, will admit the truth of the fii~st part of the&#xD;
above, every man equally well acquainted with&#xD;
him, will attest the truth of the last.&#xD;
There is, perhaps, a preliminary question that&#xD;
we ought to have settled with the editor of The&#xD;
herald before we entered upon the discussion of&#xD;
the question as to whether Jone.s is an inebriate,&#xD;
and from that cause disqualified for discharging,&#xD;
&#xD;
ThE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
i~ait1ifully, the duties of a high judicial functionary,&#xD;
and it is this-" how much liquor can a man be&#xD;
under the influence of without being considered in-&#xD;
toxicated?" It is said, but with how much truth&#xD;
we do not pretend to say, that the Herald will not&#xD;
admit a man to be drunk, "until he cannot sit,&#xD;
stand, nor lie in a ten-acre field, nor distinguish&#xD;
between his mouth and a hole in the ground." If&#xD;
this is the language of the herald and the crite-&#xD;
rion by which he estimates the moral qualities of&#xD;
men, then we shall be unable to agree with him&#xD;
upon the preli1m1iaI~)T question, and consequently,&#xD;
have no controversy with him.&#xD;
We observe, the Herald, in his justification of&#xD;
Judge Jones, says, he "baths, hates, abhors, and&#xD;
detests a drunkard." In these epithets we see the&#xD;
evi(lence of more grace than usually falls to the&#xD;
lot of political editors. They seldom exhibit much&#xD;
cont~4tion for past offences.&#xD;
But, to be serious, we do hope Jones may be&#xD;
defeated. Should lie be elected, with all his infirm-&#xD;
ities clinging to him, our confidence will be vast-&#xD;
ly impaired in the perpetuity of our Republican&#xD;
institutions and the ability of man for self-govern-&#xD;
men&#xD;
Judge Jones saw, at a glance, the effect this ar-&#xD;
ticle would have upon the thinking and better por-&#xD;

to counteract it; but what should that 'something'&#xD;

an electioneering tour. lie carried it to his room,&#xD;
at the hotel, where he stopped, and read it over;&#xD;

Barber, oui~ readers will recollect, was not pres~&#xD;

He returned upon the train about five in the morn-&#xD;
ing, in pursuit of Judge Jones, to whom he had&#xD;
sent a record for the allowance of a writ of error&#xD;
and supersedeas in an important criminal case.&#xD;
On reaching the Judge's residence he learned,&#xD;
from Mrs. Jones, the fact that the Judge had gone&#xD;
to the State capitol for the purpose of procuring a&#xD;
pardon for Hamlin, and hoping to overtake him,&#xD;
he followed to the seat of government, but was a&#xD;
very few moments too late, and consequently com-&#xD;
pelled to wait for the evening train upon which&#xD;
he reached home, as above stated.&#xD;
While at the ticket office, he was informed that&#xD;
Judge Jones had remained over, and intended going&#xD;
out on the six o'clock train. He, therefore, repaired&#xD;

TIlE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
When he called he found the house closed, but&#xD;
after considerable "noise and confusion," he suc-&#xD;
ceeded in rousing a porter, who knew nothing&#xD;
about Judge Jones. He, accordingly, made his&#xD;
way to the apartments of the landlord, and after&#xD;
some: delay, ascertained the number of the room&#xD;
occupied by the Judge. "But," remarked the&#xD;
hotel-keeper, "you had better let the Judge sleep,&#xD;
and call down after breakfast and see him. it has&#xD;
not been long since he retired, and he was most&#xD;
'gloriously fuddled.' I doubt very much whether&#xD;
you can do any business with him, even if you&#xD;
should be so fortunate as to get him up."&#xD;
I must see him immediately," answered Barber.&#xD;
"He intends going out upon the train which leaves&#xD;
in less than half an hour, and he is probably now&#xD;
up."&#xD;
The landlord protested. Barber insisted, and&#xD;
finally snatching a lighted candle, which stood upon&#xD;
a table., he started for the Judge's room; on reach-&#xD;
ing which, he found Judge Jones incapable of be-&#xD;
ing roused. After several ineffectual efforts to&#xD;
awake him, he turned to his carpet sack, which&#xD;
chanced to be unlocked, and took from it a bundle&#xD;
of papers containing the "aforesaid" record, and&#xD;
among the papers, his eye fell upon a sealed letter,&#xD;
addressed, in the hand-writing of his Excellency,&#xD;
the Governorto the Sheriff of the counting which&#xD;
Ilamhin had been tried, convicted, and was that&#xD;
day to suffer the extreme penalty of the law. Bar-&#xD;

ber stood a morn~ent, though usually cool and de-&#xD;

try in g exigences of his life he had before experi-&#xD;
enced, he exclaimed: "Is that a pardon, a commu-&#xD;
tation, a respite, or any thing to do with the Ham-&#xD;
un execution ? "-answered his own interrogation&#xD;
by saying : "It must have something to do with it,&#xD;
else why writtdi ?"&#xD;
Again he attempted to arouse Jones, hut was&#xD;
no more successful than before: all that he could&#xD;
get from the drunken official was an inarticulate&#xD;
grunt, quite as unsatisfactory as could be imag-&#xD;
ined.&#xD;
Barber here took ~ut his time-piece and discov-&#xD;
ered that he had scarcely time to reach the depot&#xD;
before the train would leave. With the prompt-&#xD;
ness and decision of a man of intellectual and&#xD;
moral worth, determined to deliver the letter to the&#xD;
sheriff; and accordingly started for the train at the&#xD;
top of his speed-which he reached, and upon which&#xD;
he stepped, just as it had gained a motion that a&#xD;
second later would have precluded the possibility&#xD;
of safely accomplishing.&#xD;
Barber seated himself in a car, entirely alone.&#xD;
The agitated state of his mind was better felt than&#xD;
described, and wholly unfitted him for compan-&#xD;
ionship: though several gentlemen and ladies were&#xD;
on board with whom he was intimately acquainted;&#xD;
he preferred to commune with hi~ own thought~.&#xD;

THE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
After the lapse of an hour he broke out in the&#xD;
~foIlowing soliloquy: "Jones doubtless knows! It&#xD;
is scarcely possible that it is a pardon. If so, would&#xD;
Jones have incurred the risk of not having it reach&#xD;
its destiny in time to save the victim of his folly?&#xD;
Impossible!! It cannot be a pardon. Well, is it&#xD;
a commutation of his punishment, or a respite?&#xD;
If either, and not a pardon, it is quite as impor-&#xD;
tant that it should reach its destination before the&#xD;
time for the execution shall have expired. "I,"&#xD;
continued he, " doubt if it is either or any of them.&#xD;
But what it is? Jones has been to see the Coy&#xD;
ernor; and I recognize that superscription as the&#xD;
hand-writing of his Excellency: and if not a par-&#xD;
don, a respite or coinrntitatioii, why should Judge&#xD;
Jones be carrying this thing to the Sheriff, at this&#xD;
particular time? It must be one of the three. Why&#xD;
did he not proceed on his way last evening, and&#xD;
not defer till to-morrow?&#xD;
Tomorrow is that lamp upon the marsh which the traveler never&#xD;
reacheth:&#xD;
To.morroW. the wrecker's bcacou--wily snare of the destroyer.&#xD;
Theoncile conviction with delay, and to-morrow is a fatal lie 1"&#xD;
"But," continued Barber, "thia folly yes, moro&#xD;
than folly-this crime of the Judge, is~ upon rc-&#xD;
flection, easily accounted for. I have no idea he&#xD;
intended to become drunken at the time of the&#xD;
Hamlin trial: yet he was quite intoxicated through&#xD;
its entire progress. The Bar of N. ought to share&#xD;
with the Judge the ignominy of that affair. He&#xD;

&#xD;
is amiable and rather passive in such matters, and&#xD;
drank at their solicitation, oftener than he would&#xD;
if left to his own volition. Intemperance is a so-&#xD;
cial vice, into which a good man is liable to&#xD;
fall. It is seldom that a man not distinguished&#xD;
for his social qualities falls into the sin of drunk-&#xD;
enness; and it is quite as seldom that the penu-&#xD;
rious, close-fisted individual is submerged by the&#xD;
waves of intemperance: and hence Jones has been&#xD;
victimized. It is scarcely possible that a man of&#xD;
his peculiar temperament and mental organization,&#xD;
traveling over the State, and constantly coming in&#xD;
contact with members of the Bar, who are as con-&#xD;
stantly urging him. to drink, should escape the vice&#xD;
into which he seems to have irretrievably fallen.&#xD;
it is a theme for tears, to feel the soft heart hardening,"&#xD;
I have not a doubt but he reached our town last&#xD;
evening, en route for N., and was met ~t the de-&#xD;
pot by Leblond and other kindred spirits, and per-&#xD;
suaded to remain over, and I have as little doubt&#xD;
he was by the same influence induced to drink im~&#xD;
moderately."&#xD;
Barber ~vas now nearing the place of his desti-&#xD;
nation, when the engineer who had charge of the&#xD;
train, was discovered to be quite intoxicated, and&#xD;
putting the train through at a rate without a pre-&#xD;
cedent.&#xD;
The conductor stepped forward and charged&#xD;
him with being under the influence of liquor, and&#xD;
having it concealed about his person; all of which&#xD;

be doggedly denied, and refused to surrender his&#xD;
post; telling the conductor, that, while he had his&#xD;
duties assigned him by the superintendent, he was&#xD;
entirely independent of the conductor, and woul(l&#xD;
act his own pleasure.&#xD;
The conductor had scarcely retired to the back&#xD;
end of the train, when the engineer, in passing&#xD;
through a deep cut, and around a curve at the&#xD;
extremity, saw some cattle upon the track, only a&#xD;
few hundred feet before him-he attempt ted to re-&#xD;
verse the power, but slipped, or rather stumbled&#xD;
upon a stick of wood, he had left carelessly in his&#xD;
way, missed his aim, and in an instant the locomo-&#xD;
live was upon the cattle ; three of which were kil-&#xD;
1~ed-the train off the track, and its engineer un-&#xD;
der its ponderous wheels, a mangled mass of las-&#xD;
cerated flesh.&#xD;
Barber was now about eight miles from the ~'il.-&#xD;
lage of N., with sufficient time to reach it upon a&#xD;
fleet horse bat where was it to come from?&#xD;
He started for a farm house, in the immediate&#xD;
vicinity of the disaster, in front of the door of which&#xD;
he saw a horse fastened to a ~)ost, and upon reach-&#xD;
i~ng it he untied the animal and mounted, while the&#xD;
owner stood at a distance, in amazement at the&#xD;
1.oldness with which the dextrous thief, as he sup-&#xD;
posed, galloped off his favorite animal.&#xD;
Barber pushed his horse, which was somewhat&#xD;
logy, to the top of his speed; and would occasion-&#xD;
ally take out his watch, and as he flew along, count&#xD;
&#xD;
the minutes he had lcft. While descending along&#xD;
and steep declivity, his horse fell, and threw Bar-&#xD;
ber some distance from him, but without either&#xD;
lmorsc or rider sustaining any serious injury. For-&#xD;
tunately, the horse rose and stood perfectly still&#xD;
until Barber again mounted and was ready to pur-&#xD;
sue his journey. Very soon after this second dis-&#xD;
aster, Barber came in sight of the multitude and&#xD;
the scaffold. And as our reader has been al-&#xD;
ready apprised of what occurred between this and&#xD;
the delivery of the letter, we shall not stop to re-&#xD;
capitulate.&#xD;
The Sheriff immediately tore off the envelope&#xD;
and i'ead aloud, not a complete pardon, but a com-&#xD;
mutation of the death penalty to perpetual con-&#xD;
finement in the State pr~~n; at which a greater&#xD;
manifestation ofjoy was evinced by the crowd than&#xD;
was exhibited by the convict.&#xD;
Judge Jones, whom we have left in a death-like&#xD;
siLlinber, at length arose; and finding he was left&#xD;
by the train, repaired to the telegraph office; but&#xD;
there had the pain and mortification to learn that&#xD;
the wires were severed and no communication could&#xD;
be had with N. His feelings, now wrought up to&#xD;
a perfect pbrcnzy, he immediately employed ami&#xD;
extra train of cars, at a heavy expense-deter-&#xD;
mined to repair the wrong if in his power-and&#xD;
reached the scene of Barber's first disaster, but a&#xD;
few minutes after the latter had started on horse-&#xD;
back for N,&#xD;

THE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The extra train was upon the ruins of its prede-&#xD;
cessor, before it was discovered, and the crash was~&#xD;
frightful. But Judge Jones was among the few&#xD;
fortunate who received no material injury. After&#xD;
he recovered from the confusion occasioned by the&#xD;
shock, he concluded that all hope of reaching N~&#xD;
in time to save Hamlin was cut oW and he entirely&#xD;
lost self-possesion, and raved like a mad-man. As&#xD;
soon as the paroxism had subsided, he became a&#xD;
pitious picture of agony, and exclaimed:&#xD;
"Why did not Heaven, in its just wrath, crush&#xD;
me beneath that broken and chaotic mass? If&#xD;
this train shall fail to reach there in time, I shall&#xD;
terminate my troubled existence, if there is death&#xD;
in that instrument;" laying his hand upon a well&#xD;
charged revolver, ensconced in his breast pocket.&#xD;
The lives sacrificed by the collision of the trains,&#xD;
it is no part of our present purpose to stop and re~&#xD;
count; but suffice it to say, they were offered&#xD;
upon the altar of rum; and that the tears of scores,&#xD;
by it made widows and orphans, have embalmed&#xD;

thisplan, he was, a few days subsequently, sitting in&#xD;
his office, which had been closed for several weeks,&#xD;
arranging papers, accounts, and dispatching busi-&#xD;
ness with his usual facility, when he was aroused&#xD;
by a large crowd about the door. lie was taken&#xD;
1)y surprise, and a little startled, at tbe moment.&#xD;
Various thoughts flashed across the horizon of his&#xD;
mental vision. 1-fe, previously confiding, had lost&#xD;
confidence in the integrity of his fellow men. his&#xD;
first impulse was to escape through the back-door,&#xD;
and in that way to leave the mob-for such he, at&#xD;
that moment, regarded it-to the empty enjoy-&#xD;
ment of disappointment. But, again, it occi~rred&#xD;
to him that no harm could be intended; that&#xD;
though he had occupied the f~lon's cell and the&#xD;
felon's gibbet, yet subsequent developments,&#xD;
"strong as proofs of holy writ," had established&#xD;
his innocence; and then, it would be unmanly to&#xD;
exhibit fear; and he decided, in less than half the&#xD;
time it has taken us to write it,, to wait the result.&#xD;
In a f~w moments a huzza for ilamhin went up&#xD;
that mate the wilkin ring, and he was loudly called&#xD;
for. He rose, stepped to the door, and bo~ved;&#xD;
when one-a gentleman of some celebrity, and&#xD;
considerable notoriety, from an adjoining county&#xD;
-stepped upon a store-box, which chanced to be-&#xD;
lying in the neighborhood of Hamlin's office, and&#xD;
remarked, that the concourse of people then before&#xD;
his Honor, Mr. Hamhin, was a delegation from dif-&#xD;
if~r~ut poi~tion~ of the Senatorial districtt ;mctj~&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
that time, for the purpose of respectfully request-&#xD;
ing him to be a candidate for the Senate. That&#xD;
many prominent reasons had dictated the move-&#xD;
ment, butt most prominent, was his fitness for the&#xD;
position. That he had suffered all that could he&#xD;
inflicted upon man, but death; which infliction had&#xD;
grown out of an evil that was increasing apd&#xD;
spreading, and destined, if not arrested, to deso-&#xD;
late the fairest portions of the globe.&#xD;
The speaker here paused for a reply.&#xD;
Ilamlin, from the door of his office, said that no&#xD;
man could more fully appreciate their kindness&#xD;
than himself; that lie had suffered much-every-&#xD;
thing butt death and a consciousness of guilt;-&#xD;
that during his darkest hours he had enjoyed-&#xD;
What nothing earthly gives or can destroy;&#xD;
The souls calni sun~hiue, and the hearifolt joy&#xD;
Of virtues prize."&#xD;
lie was now willing to make any sacrifice to ban-&#xD;
ish the evil of drunkenness from the land; and,&#xD;
indeed, from all lands; but he could not, as he&#xD;
he thought, be made believe that his promotion to&#xD;
a seat in the State Senate, would accelerate the&#xD;
happy day when no man would dare make his&#xD;
neighbor drunk; that if lie conid be persuaded of&#xD;
the fact, he would consent to be a candidate, not~&#xD;
xvithstanding it would be exceedingly unpleasant&#xD;
for ~him to come before the public. That there&#xD;
were other gentlemen's names now before the peo-&#xD;

pie, for the office, who would be able to render the&#xD;
cause much more valuable service than he could,&#xD;
and therefore he would, most respectfully, beg&#xD;
leave to positively decline the honor they had so&#xD;
kindly sought to bestow upon him.&#xD;
"You must be a candidate !" went up from scores&#xD;
and hundreds; "arid no other ~vill answer our&#xD;
purpose !"&#xD;
Again their was comparative silence, and the&#xD;
speaker upon the box proceeded to say, he was&#xD;
inclined to the opinion, that however averse Mr.&#xD;
Hamlin might be, to the use of his name in con-&#xD;
nection with the office, the people would vote for&#xD;
him-most gladly with his consent, but most cer-&#xD;
tainly with, or without it.&#xD;
Hamlin remarked, that the 'synagogues ofsatan'&#xD;
were numerous in the di~tvict, and as it was uni-&#xD;
versally known, in every county of which it was&#xD;
composed, that he had suffered severely from the&#xD;
evil of intemperance, it would' of course be pre-&#xD;
sumed, he would advocate, to the extent of his&#xD;
ability, a stringent prohibitory law; and that, there-&#xD;
fore, the liquor influence would present an unbro-&#xD;
ken front in opposition to his election. That in&#xD;
or~.inary times, and under ordinary circumstances,&#xD;
to be a target, and receive the shots of malice from&#xD;
unprincipled and irresponsible demagogues, was&#xD;
quite as much as a man of common sensibil-&#xD;
ity could' endure; and that having passed so re-&#xD;
cently through a world of trouble, to come ii~ con-&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
tact with this army of drinking men-goaded to&#xD;
desperation by the thought of having the liquor&#xD;
traffic interfered with, many of the more reck-&#xD;
less and desperate would not hesitate to fling into&#xD;
his teeth his late misfortune, and he would come&#xD;
out of the fight, certainly not more than second&#xD;
best, covered with the filth and the slime of the&#xD;
contest, without remedy; and, therefore, must be&#xD;
permitted to decline the honor of being their stand-&#xD;
ard-bearer.&#xD;
"We," exclaimed numerous voices, "will take&#xD;
care of your character, and of the rum influence,&#xD;
too ! " And at this moment the crowd pressed&#xD;
upon him, while two of the more sturdy yeomanry,&#xD;
present, seized Hamlin, and bore him off upon&#xD;
their shoulder~ to the front of the printing office,&#xD;
where he was detained until a deputation was sent&#xD;
in ~itli orders to xvithdraw the name of every man&#xD;
previously announced, and to run up Hamlin's.&#xD;
This done, they proceeded, in like i~~ani~erto two&#xD;
other printing establishments in the village, and&#xD;
produced like results. Heavy delegations were&#xD;
sent to each county-seat in the District, and the&#xD;
name of the other candidates for the office ordered&#xD;
out of the papers and Ilamlin's inserted.&#xD;
ilamlin and his friends soon discovered that&#xD;
he had not been mistaken in anticipating unflinch-&#xD;
ing opposition from the liquor influence. On the&#xD;
evening after Hamlin was forced to be a candi-&#xD;
date, a caucus ~vas held in a liquor store, with&#xD;

from whom the liquor traffic had no mercy to expect,&#xD;
would be elected.&#xD;
"Past hope of safety 'i was his 1ate~4 care,&#xD;
Like fallen Cre~ar, deeciitly to die."&#xD;
Admiring the philosophy of Dryden, one of&#xD;
Jiamlin's most formidable competitors chose xol-&#xD;
untarily to withdraw from the contest, a few days&#xD;
previous to the election, and so informed his friends&#xD;
by every possible facility.&#xD;
Now came the tug of war. All the horses and&#xD;
buggies in the Distri6t, were brought in requisition,&#xD;
and for the two days preceding the day of elec-&#xD;
tion, hundreds of men were in motion, and actively&#xD;
passing from point to point in the District, and&#xD;
from house to house. In passing around, a friend&#xD;
of Hamlin chanced to come in contact with one of&#xD;
the patrons of the groceries, who was attempting&#xD;
to make his way home, but had fallen by the way~&#xD;
side and was lying in a helpless condition. lie&#xD;
raised him up and helped him on to his desolate&#xD;
abode, which was not far distant. On his way, the&#xD;
poor drunken wretch urged our friend to use all&#xD;
his influence against Ilarulin's election, and took&#xD;
from his pocket a bundle of handbills, which h~&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
said he was to circulate in his neighborhood.&#xD;
These bills, which were, without delay, carried to&#xD;
iLlamlin and his friends, contained inflammatory ap-&#xD;
peals to the friends of the traffic, urging them to&#xD;
spare neither time nor money in procuring every&#xD;
man in the District opposed to a prohibitory law,&#xD;
to be early at the polls, nor cease their exertions&#xD;
until the ballot-box should be closed.&#xD;
To counteract the effect of' these hand-bills with&#xD;
which the country had been flooded, th.e Flamlin&#xD;
party threw out one, and thousands of copies were&#xD;
sent into all parts of the District. About Hamlin's,&#xD;
there was nothing of the inflamatory character. It&#xD;
~vas an earnest and powerful appeal to the sober,&#xD;
moral, and better portion of community, to rally&#xD;
and save themselves, their friends and the country,&#xD;
from the blighting and scathing curse of intempe-&#xD;
rance.&#xD;
An excitement now perx-aded the District, with..&#xD;
out precedent ther , or elsewhere. The morning&#xD;
of the election dawned upon hundreds of&#xD;
horses harnessed f2r the purpose of conveying the&#xD;
sick and infirm to the polls; nor was there any&#xD;
abatement of exertion, upon either side, until after&#xD;
six o'clock, when the statute declared the ballot&#xD;
box should be closed. On one side there was a&#xD;
contest for principle-for morality-for peace, pros-&#xD;
perity. and every thing that tends to promote the&#xD;
welfare of society. Upon the other side, it was a&#xD;
contest into which eAtered all the baser passions&#xD;

District was, during the following night and the&#xD;

But virtue and temperance triumphed. The&#xD;

liquors; and when they heard his name mentioned,&#xD;
they were reminded of their duty to society. They&#xD;

the time appointed, Barber appeared and discus~.&#xD;
sed his political opinions, for about two hours, be-&#xD;
fore a large crowd; and when about to close, a&#xD;
drunken tavern-keeper, of the vicinity, whom Le-&#xD;
blond had sent to annoy Barber, called on him to&#xD;
define his position upon the Maine Law.&#xD;
1-lere Barber was somewhat nonplussed, but re-&#xD;
solved to make the most of it, by an effort to cx~&#xD;
pose Leblond as well as the landlord.&#xD;
See here, old customer," said Barber, "you&#xD;
keep a tavern down here in the country three or&#xD;
four miles, I believe ?"&#xD;
"Well, Ido."&#xD;
" You sell liquor, I suppose ?"&#xD;
"Well, I don't d.o any thing else."&#xD;
"You don't do anything else, eh? It must be&#xD;
profitable ?"&#xD;
"Yes; I suppoi4 my family honestly, and that&#xD;
is more than you htwyers do, unless you are terri-&#xD;
bly lied on."&#xD;
"Hoxv many children have you, my old fellow ?'~&#xD;
"Just the same number that followed John&#xD;
Rogers to the stake, only, I believe, there is none&#xD;
at the breast."&#xD;
"Well," said Barber, "that is quite a respecta-&#xD;
ble family. Oh, J)ardOn me; I mean respectable&#xD;
in point of number.~~&#xD;
"Well, I guess as how my family is as respecta-&#xD;
ble as yours."&#xD;
&#xD;
j&#xD;
&#xD;
That may be, but if you continue to sell liquor&#xD;
it may soon become questionable."&#xD;
"1 am an honest man; I want you to mind that,&#xD;
as you go along, old lawyer!"&#xD;
"Certainly, certainly!" said Barber; "men of&#xD;
your profession are all honest. But to whom do&#xD;
you sell liquor?"&#xD;
"Why, to my neighbors, to be sure; who else do&#xD;
you think I would sell to? I never sold any to&#xD;
you, that's sartin."&#xD;
"No," said Barber; "nor that is not all, you&#xD;
never will."&#xD;
"Did you ever spend any thing to treat your&#xD;
friends with?" said Boniface.&#xD;
"Not very lately," said Barber, "nor, do I think,&#xD;
I ever will. If I can't get votes~ without buying&#xD;
them with whiskey, I shall be content to do with-&#xD;
out them."&#xD;
"That's just the difference between.you and Mr.&#xD;
Leblond. lie drinks a horn with me, every time&#xD;
he comes along; and that is pretty frequently,&#xD;
about these times; and he always pays for it, too;&#xD;
and I don't think it's anybody's business but his&#xD;
own, neither, if he pays for it. And if he happens&#xD;
to leave a few dollars with me, to treat his friends,&#xD;
I don't think that any of your business. If I give&#xD;

"Oh, yes," said Barber; "1 can tcll very soon&#xD;

Well, old lawyer, you think you 'r smart; but&#xD;

nobody is cheated bad but the candidate that's dc-.&#xD;
f~ated, because was too stingy to treat a little."&#xD;
"That may comport with your notions of hon..&#xD;

Before Barber had closed the above sentence,&#xD;
the tavern-keeper was seen making his way out of&#xD;

&#xD;
{           Barber now went on to remark, that his opin~&#xD;
were well understood in that 'community-that he&#xD;
ions, as to the necessity of a prohibitory liquor law,&#xD;
never had any concealment to make-that his&#xD;
views upon that subject, could have nothing to do&#xD;
I          with his duties, as a member of CongTess, no more&#xD;
than his notions of the divinity of the Koran-that&#xD;
4          there could be no legislation by Congr~ss, involv-&#xD;
ing the heavenly authority of the one, or (he ne~&#xD;
cessity of the other,-that, as he disdained dis-&#xD;
guisc, he would say he was in favor of a law that&#xD;
would amount to prohibition; and that he cared&#xD;
'V&#xD;
not by what name it should be known, as it might&#xD;
be quite as efficacious by one as an other.&#xD;
He had no doubt Leblond would derive great&#xD;
satisfaction from the public avowal he had just&#xD;
made. "No declaration's for the public eye," was&#xD;
his competitor's motto-that he did not know butt&#xD;
A          the result would prove it the true policy; yet he&#xD;
could not reconcile it with his views of manliness.&#xD;
Though he had made no public declarations upon&#xD;
that, or any other subject, he had made numerous&#xD;
contradictory private ones; and as he had a speci-.&#xD;
men of the private communications of the gentle.-&#xD;
rnan-about as non-committal as anything he had&#xD;
seen in print, or elsewhere,-though private, it was&#xD;
in answer to a public challenge he had made him.&#xD;
Drawing from his pocket the note of Leblond,&#xD;
which we have given at the beginning of this&#xD;
chapter, ~read it, and then added,, that if he had&#xD;
jtii&#xD;
&#xD;
~?elt inclined to trifle, he might have 'sent the gen-&#xD;
tieman, in answer, the following lines from Young's&#xD;
Love of Fame:&#xD;

As men of wealth may venture to go plaint&#xD;
I find the fool, when I behold the screen,&#xD;
For, 'us the wise mans ii~tcrest to be seen?'&#xD;
~LBtlt,)~ continued Barber, "I am iir favor of a prr&#xD;
hibitory law that xvill effectually protect us against&#xD;
the greatest curse with which Go cI has ever per-&#xD;
mitted the human family to be ailhicted; and in&#xD;

into utter iflSi~"I1ihCaIWC. This foulest whelp of&#xD;

He went on to say, that he would not stop to&#xD;
delineate the tendency of this vice to annihilate all&#xD;
the finer feelings of the human heart. That he&#xD;
should not stop to show hoxv effectually it con-&#xD;
verted the kind husband and indulgent father into&#xD;

earth with tears and woe----how it brutalizes all&#xD;
that come withi~i its fatal grasp; petrifying every&#xD;
thing by the magic of its touch; but would content&#xD;
himself, by noticing its effects upon us as tax-pay-&#xD;

He argued that in this golden age, things were&#xD;
judged of in the light of the~ big dollar. That&#xD;
which reached into the pocket received immediate&#xD;
attention, and was the only avenue through which&#xD;
some men cotild be reached. That the pocket ar-&#xD;
guinent was usually successful when all others&#xD;
failed. here, he showed, by facts and figures, the&#xD;
expenses of the county to be about six thousand&#xD;
dollars, for the three years preceding; and that, by&#xD;
a careful inspection of the causes that led to the&#xD;
commission of crime, the startling statistical fact&#xD;
was derived, that a fraction over four-fifths of all&#xD;
the crime committed in their county, during that&#xD;
period, had been produced, either directly or indi-&#xD;
rectly, by the use of alcoholic drinks as a beverage.&#xD;
That if they would add to this the expense of sus-&#xD;
taining the poor, made so by intemperance, they&#xD;
might have some idea of the amount they paid&#xD;
annually, in the shape of a county tax, for the sup-&#xD;
port of this vice. A sum suflici~nt to support a&#xD;
first class academy in their county. That when&#xD;
they added the cost of the liquor, the time spent in&#xD;
drinking and recovering from its effects-the de-&#xD;
struction of property by fire, and other accidents&#xD;
corwtantly oceuring from its use, they had an eno~-&#xD;

mous sum-an amount sufficient to endow and&#xD;
sustain an excellent College in their midst; from&#xD;
which would flow out streams of intellectual and&#xD;
moj~al culture, irrigating and fertilizing the entire&#xD;
community.&#xD;
He insisted, that if a sister county would at-&#xD;
tempt to lay their county under a contribution&#xD;
equal to the one extorted by this vice, that instead&#xD;
of laying down under the oppression, they would&#xD;
soon evince the spirit of "76." That from lad to&#xD;
gray-haired sire, all would "draw the sword and&#xD;
throw away the scabbard," in maintenance of their&#xD;
rights. Yet they were submitting to an oppres-&#xD;

them by the rum traffic.&#xD;
"Your duty, my fellow-citizens," said he, "to&#xD;

There is now going off, in our Congressional&#xD;

two eminent lawyers, both distino'uished for their&#xD;
ability, but not alike distinguished for their fair-&#xD;
ness and candor.&#xD;
'Tis great, 'tis manly, to disdain dis~nse,&#xD;
It ShOWS our spirit, oY jj ~YOYCS OilY&#xD;
Though we differ with Mr. Barber, politically,&#xD;
we are pleased with his frankness, and his manly&#xD;
method of electioneering, while we cannot accord&#xD;
to Mr. Leblond our entire approbation.&#xD;
"There is a disease, extensively prevailing,&#xD;
among the political aspirants of the present day,&#xD;
we loath and detest; and we can find for it no&#xD;
more appropriate name than that of demagogue-&#xD;
ism. Whether Mr. Leblond has contracted the in-&#xD;
fection is a question we shall not now stop to in-&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
vestigate, but we will, say, if Mr. Leblond should&#xD;
choose to 'stoop to conquer,' the record made by&#xD;
Barber, thus far, justifies us in the conclusion, that&#xD;
he has no disposition to imitate Lebloiid's example.&#xD;
'Stoop to conquer,' is a sentiment unworthy of a&#xD;
talented, virtuous, and high-minded man, aspiring&#xD;
to be a statesman. It is unworthy of the enlight~&#xD;
ened age in which we live.&#xD;
"We very much reget the position Leblond has&#xD;
deemed it important fQr him to occupy upon the&#xD;
temperance measure. It is not involved in the&#xD;
light; and it is, therefore, neither honest nor manly&#xD;
in him to drag it into the controversy, and attempt&#xD;
improperly, to make capital out of it against a&#xD;
man too honest to disguise his sentiments upon&#xD;
that or any other subject upon which the people&#xD;
focI an interest. But what is worse, he is said to&#xD;
be at every point of the compass upon this subject.&#xD;
Chameleon like, he assumes the peculiar hue of&#xD;
those around him at the moment. If this be true,&#xD;
it is base, and eXhibits him unworthy of public&#xD;
confidence. We have lono'~ince come to con-~&#xD;
the&#xD;
elusion, that the man who will deceive you for the&#xD;
purpose of getting your vote, will betray you in&#xD;
sacrificing y our interests after he has your vote,&#xD;
if he has any motive to actuate him; for most cer-&#xD;

"The Maine law ean scarcely be said to be a&#xD;

That it will eventually become a political ques-&#xD;
tion we have no doubt. Why it should not-and&#xD;

can imagine. Why a question, involving the inter-&#xD;
ests and welfare of the people-the whole people,&#xD;

than the question of a prohibitory liquor law. It&#xD;
is claimed, upon no less authority than the lion.&#xD;

Edward Everett, that ardent spirits, within the&#xD;
last ten years, has cost this nation a direct expense&#xD;

That it has, within that lime, destroyed over three&#xD;
hundred thousand lives; and consigned to our jails&#xD;
some two hundred thousand more; and made pau-&#xD;
pers of over one hundred thousand of our children.&#xD;
That it has, within that period, caused some two&#xD;

children-instige ted over fifteen hundred murders;&#xD;
and within the same length of time, burnt and de-&#xD;

If these are facts, and who can doubt them, sup-&#xD;

they not startling, and sufficient to rouse every&#xD;

following&#xD;
"Halloo, there, you man of the Gazette, please&#xD;
tell us; When did you stop drinking? We shall&#xD;
very soon expect from you an essay on moral phi-&#xD;

we may go further, he is an honest man and a sin-&#xD;

could not vote for our father, nor a brother, if he&#xD;
differed with us in politics. Barber is spending&#xD;
his energies in pulling down, what we are attempt-&#xD;

self to establish. Now, it strikes us with consider-&#xD;
able Three, that consistency, as well as fealty to&#xD;
party, requires us to use all honorable means&#xD;
within our reach, to sustain the nominee of our&#xD;
party. We are supporting measures, and not men.&#xD;

would sustain and vote for the representative of&#xD;
our principles if he were the merest 'man of straw&#xD;
without reference to the ability, qualifications, or&#xD;

fore he takes upon himself the responsibility of de~&#xD;
eating our candidate for Congress. That he can&#xD;
produce much dissension and trouble in his own&#xD;
county, if not in other portions of the District, we&#xD;
have no doubt. If from personal dislikes, or other&#xD;
reasons, he is unwilling to give Mr. Leblond that&#xD;
support to which he, as the regular nominee of the&#xD;
party, is entitled: we hope he will, at least, remain&#xD;

All the papers of the District, belonging to Le-&#xD;
blond's political school, chimed in with the Repub.-&#xD;
lican-the Gazette standing isolated and alone in&#xD;
its opposition to Leblond. To thc above article,&#xD;
the Gazette, in its next issue, replied as follows&#xD;
"This gulping process, and blind adhesion to&#xD;
party-particularly, when there are no political is-&#xD;
sues; no principles upon which the American peo-&#xD;
pie are, or can be divided-a mere scramble for&#xD;
patronage; a contest for the 'loves and fishes '-&#xD;
we regard as one of the most unfavorable indica-&#xD;
tions in the signs of the times, and one that har-&#xD;
bingers anything but th~ growth, progress, and&#xD;
welfare of our country~&#xD;
"The religious and literary press present an unbro-&#xD;
ken front, in hostile array against intemperance.&#xD;
Now, is there any reason-can any reason be urged&#xD;
why the political press should not fall into the&#xD;
ranks, and labor unitedly for the banishment of&#xD;
&#xD;
4-&#xD;
&#xD;
this great and fearful curse of our race. Let us&#xD;
suppose this state of things for the brief period of&#xD;
two or three years: who could estimate the result?&#xD;
Tippling would in1med~ately become unpopular.&#xD;
The manufacturers of, and dealers in liquors, would&#xD;
seek other investments, upon the principle that&#xD;
rats desert a sinking ship, and the traffic would&#xD;
cease almost as by magic.&#xD;
"We cannot be in error as to the potency and&#xD;
influence of the press; all will acknowledge it. It&#xD;
makes public sentiment-regulates the actions of&#xD;
men-brings men, measures, and systems into no-&#xD;
tice, and renders them popular or odious, tt.t its will.&#xD;
What a responsibility! What a coming to judg-&#xD;
ment awaits those who wield the press, if it shall&#xD;
I&#xD;
~)e found they have compelled the scale of virtue&#xD;
to kick the beam. Are not those, then, who stand&#xD;
at the helm of. the press-who guide and give di-&#xD;
rection to it-bound by every tie that can bind&#xD;
man to man; by every tie that can bind him in the&#xD;
relation he sustains to heaven and the arbiter of&#xD;
worlds, to throw the entire weight of its influ-&#xD;
ence in the side of virtue? Vice is, and has been&#xD;
since the fall~ we had almost said, the only formi-&#xD;
dable enemy of the human race; and in whatever&#xD;
shape it may rear its deformed head, it is every&#xD;
good man's pleasure, as well as duty, to contribute&#xD;
his utmost effort to strike, it down. How much more&#xD;

&#xD;
~'~Before we close this artiel~, we will give our&#xD;
readers an item that will be news to most of them.&#xD;
Last Spring we jumped upon the cars, and in a&#xD;
few hours, was ii~XVashington city. After the&#xD;
lapse of a short time we strolled down to the cap-&#xD;
itol, and was there met by two or three members,&#xD;
in the hall of the house, who took oui' arm and&#xD;
invited us to accompany them-which wedid-first&#xD;
up one flight of stairs, and then another, through&#xD;
one nari~ow passage after another, until we finally&#xD;
came to a door, upon which our friends gently rap-&#xD;
pcd~, and was answered fvom the inside, by "who's&#xD;
there?" The pass-word was given by us, and we&#xD;
were admitted into a room where we found a ta-&#xD;
ble covered with provisions and liqmiors, and we&#xD;
were requested to cat and drink. We lingered&#xD;
there, purposely, for near an hour, to solve, if pos-&#xD;
sible, the enigma. During our stay, we saw some&#xD;
thirty or forty members come and go, but observed&#xD;
no money was paid. The more we tried to un-&#xD;
ravel this strange affair, the more mysterious it&#xD;
appeared to us. After leaving the room, we in-&#xD;
quired of one of the members what it meai~t; and&#xD;
~vas told the clerks, doori~eepers, nwssengers,&#xD;
post-masters, and other hangers on, im.~ ~nd about&#xD;
the capitolhad raised by subscription among them-&#xD;
selves, the amount necessary to defray this expense.&#xD;
But still we did not fully comprehend it until du..&#xD;

of two hundred and fifty dollars each. Now, it&#xD;
was, that the object of this grdcery in the Nation-&#xD;
al Capitol, flashed across our mind. Members by&#xD;
the score, had visited this room, during the (lay and&#xD;
evening, and had drank of their liquor, and now&#xD;
they were called upon to put their hinds into the&#xD;
public treasury, and take out about the round sum&#xD;
of one hundred thousand dollars. It was too late&#xD;
for discussion. Several distinguished gentlemen&#xD;
endeavored to obtain the floor and expose the&#xD;
glaring outrage, but were unable. While some&#xD;
of the patro~is of the Congressional grocery were&#xD;
crying "order, order!" others were bawling, "ques-&#xD;
tion, question! Give us a chance to vote! Let us&#xD;
have no speeches! Question, question !" And&#xD;
the bill passed in the midst of a scene that would&#xD;

That is only one item," continued he, "and, should&#xD;

"It cannot be denied that drunkenness has a di-&#xD;

"You have seen how the extra allowance was&#xD;
voted through. The probability is, that not a mem-&#xD;
ber was spoken to upon the subject. The liquor&#xD;
and refreshments were puPchased and taken to the&#xD;
capitol, and members invited to partake, with a&#xD;
kind of implied understanding that they were to&#xD;

and this is done with out regard to party. And as~&#xD;
the members of both political parties are generally&#xD;
implicated in these frauds upon the government,&#xD;
the party papers dare not attack the villany. There&#xD;
is usually a mutual dependence between political&#xD;
editors and politicians, and hence these enormi-.&#xD;
ties are tolerated and not exposed."&#xD;
"Why, that is a terrible state of things&#xD;
"It is nevertheless true~ Before men, as society&#xD;
has hitherto been organized, cai~ become success-&#xD;
ful politicians, they must contract the habit of tip-&#xD;
pling, more or less; and before they pass through&#xD;
the various grades and stations that fit them for a&#xD;
seat in Congress, many of them become regular&#xD;
and confirmed drunkards; and the cupidity of th~&#xD;
unprincipled scoundrels, who will lend their agency&#xD;
in this crusade against the national treasury, seize&#xD;
upon this vice and use it for their base purposes."&#xD;
"Do these plunderers of the treasury, often suc-&#xD;
ceed?"&#xD;
"Much more frequently than you would un-&#xD;
agine. The men you elect and send for the pur-&#xD;

grand and magnificent frauds upon the public&#xD;

"The above is the testimony of an intelligent&#xD;
and conscientious young man, who unhesitatingly&#xD;
refused to take the extra allowance, and who had&#xD;
all this kind of thing for two years under his ob-&#xD;
servation. Upon evidence so clear and free from&#xD;
suspicion, who would dare claim that a dissipated&#xD;
and drunken man was fit for any position of trust&#xD;
or responsibility? For our 'own part; we never&#xD;

he unlocked the door of his office; "and mother&#xD;
wishes you to call round as soon as convenient.&#xD;
Where have you been so long, Mr. Leblond? I&#xD;
have been here three or four times a day, for the&#xD;
last two weeks, and have not found you till now."&#xD;
"Oh, I have been in the country, visiting my&#xD;
friends," answered Leblond. "What is wrong&#xD;
with you, sis, this morning?"&#xD;
"Father has been acting so badly-lie has been&#xD;
treating us so unkindly! He turned us all out in&#xD;
the rain, the other night, and we got as wet as ducks,&#xD;
and little George is quite sick since. Mother tried&#xD;
to get in with the little fellow to prevent him from&#xD;
getting wet, but when she went to the door, fa-&#xD;
ther would push her back, slam the door in her&#xD;
face, arid stand against it! Poor little dear, how&#xD;
wet and cold he got! Mother has rocked him ir~&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;

L&#xD;
&#xD;
"Is your father at home?"&#xD;
"No indeed; he is in jail, and has been, nearly&#xD;
ever since you left."&#xD;
"In jail ?" Inquired Leblond, "For what ?"&#xD;
"They say he broke into a warehouse, one night,&#xD;
and took a dram of whiskey, and that he must go&#xD;
to the Penitentiary. You will not let them send&#xD;
him there for that little thing, will you, Mr. Le-&#xD;
blond?"&#xD;
"Certainly not, if I can prevent it. lie ought&#xD;
not to go to the State prison for so petty an offence&#xD;
as that."&#xD;
"Ma does nothing but cry and rock little George,&#xD;
since pa went to jail. We are all so sorry for pa,&#xD;
he has talked so good, and been so kind to us since&#xD;
he went to prison, lIe has been sober all the time,&#xD;
wants us to get him out, and says he will never&#xD;
drink any more. WThen he is sober, he is very&#xD;
good and kind to mother and the children. We&#xD;
want him home again; you will help us, Mr. Le-&#xD;
blond, won't you?"&#xD;
"I will," said Leblond, and immediately locked&#xD;
his office, and started to see Mrs. Sibley.&#xD;
Upon entering her door he remarked, "Your&#xD;
daughter has been narrating a most unfortunate&#xD;

Sibley. You are the only person of his acquain~&#xD;

No sooner had you left then he became entirely&#xD;

that the curtain would drop upon this scene ! I&#xD;
sicken and grow faint at the thought of its exten-&#xD;

~sooner or later, be able to reform him; but en~&#xD;
treaties, tears, and prayers, are alike unavailing ;&#xD;
and he seems to be letting himself downy lower and&#xD;
lower, and every succeeding day cutting himself&#xD;
more and more effectually loose from every re~&#xD;

minutes, and then sobbed-" Misery and suffering&#xD;
is my doom until the grave, which I trust is not&#xD;

"Jane informs me he is in prison. What are the&#xD;
circumstances which led to his arrest?"&#xD;
~' The facts are few. I was present at the ex~&#xD;
examination before the magistrate, and it appeared&#xD;
that Thomas Johnson, about nine o'clock, two&#xD;
weeks ago to-morrow night, had occasion to step&#xD;
into his warehouse; and after he had unlocked hi~&#xD;
door, he heard a noise-immediately struck a light,&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;amp;~~d discovered Mr. Sibley concealed behind a cask&#xD;
ofliquor; that he enquired of him how he got therc~,&#xD;
and what he was doing; to which Mr. Sibley replied,&#xD;
lie raised a window sash and entered; that he&#xD;
had taken nothing, and intended to take nothing&#xD;
but a glass of whiskey; and that, having got it,&#xD;
he was ready to leave; that he was induced to go&#xD;
in, for the reason he had been without liquor nearly&#xD;
all day, and without the means of getting it other*&#xD;
wise. You will now tell me, frankly, what you&#xD;
think of his case, so I may be prepared for the worst&#xD;
feature it can assume? Can it be, be is liable to&#xD;
be sent to the State prison for taking only one glass&#xD;
of liquor? XVe feel that the poor, unfortunate man&#xD;
deserves our sympathies rather than our censure."&#xD;
Lebloiid said he had no doubt a technical bur~&#xD;
gi ary had been committed, for the commission of&#xD;
which, Mr. Sibley, if vigorously prosecuted, might&#xD;
bc sent to the State prison; but as Sibley had few&#xD;
personal enemies, he hoped the prosecution could&#xD;
be suppressed. lie would do all he could to avoid&#xD;
a prosecution, but if he should find himself unable&#xD;
to prevent it, then he would defend him with all&#xD;
the power he possessed.&#xD;
Mrs. Sibley hoped to God he would. She said&#xD;
he had been very cruel to her and the children, but&#xD;
it was now more his misfortune than his fault.-.&#xD;

it was useless to urge farther; when he became&#xD;

When I recovered my children were standing&#xD;
around my bed, where they had darned me, weep-&#xD;
ing. I saw no more of Mr. Sibley, for two days,&#xD;
and have not since seen the six shillings. When&#xD;
I fell I suppose he took the money from my bosom.&#xD;
I thought so, not only for the reason the money&#xD;
was gone, but because of his long absence. The&#xD;
unprincipled liquor retailers would not have kept&#xD;
him about them a moment longer than his money&#xD;
was exhausted. Mr. Leblond, you may think it&#xD;
pretty strong language for a lady to use, but I must&#xD;
say, if the devil do not catch these scamps, 1 am&#xD;
unabl~ to see the use to which a hell could be put,"&#xD;

unfortunate ~tnd ruined husband; but that, not-&#xD;

V.;&#xD;
&#xD;
withstanding, she could not endure the idea of his&#xD;
going to the Penitentiary.&#xD;
"I have," continued she, "been frequently at&#xD;
the jail, since his imprisonment, and he promises&#xD;
reformation; and it may be if he can be saved&#xD;
from the consequences of this folly-for it was not&#xD;
a crime-he may yet live to be a blessing to his&#xD;
family, and useful to society. I have nothing with&#xD;
which to compensate you, hut hope you will spare&#xD;
no pains."&#xD;
Leblond said he wanted no pay, and would'&#xD;
exert himself to save him. The term of Court&#xD;
at which he was to be tried, was approaching;&#xD;
and Leblond, anxious to see his old friend and&#xD;
preceptor again enjoying his liberty, called up-&#xD;
on the public Prosecutor to ascertain if the pros-&#xD;
ecution could not be stopped, but was informed,&#xD;
"that such had been the base and infamous char-&#xD;

the twenty-seventh-of last month, the Defendant,&#xD;
~jblev; had entered the warehouse of Thomas&#xD;
&#xD;
Johnson, by hoisting a window sash; and stole one&#xD;
gill of whiskey."&#xD;
Barber said that he had no language adi-&#xD;
quate to the task of 'conveying a faint idea of his&#xD;
feelings upon so solemn an occasion. That when&#xD;
he reflected, the Defendant was a member of the&#xD;
bar-once an. honorable and distinguished mem-&#xD;
ber-with as high hopes and, flattering prospects&#xD;
as any man in, or out of the State; it pained him&#xD;
to the heart to see him now ajuiseral~ie wreck of&#xD;
his former self; without. hopes, without money,&#xD;
~vitho~t every thing-.ev en without friends, except&#xD;
his unfortunate wife and children ; and they, and&#xD;
they alone, of all the world, notwithstanding his&#xD;
brutal treatment of them, still clung around&#xD;

him. The man, once the pride of the community&#xD;
in which he lived, now so low that&#xD;
"None S) poor as do him reverence.&#xD;
It was not only painful to the feelings, but was&#xD;
deeplyy humiliating, to see a ma:~ of such brilliant&#xD;

teresting prosl)eets beckoning him onward and&#xD;
upward, he had allowed a beastly appetite to dis-&#xD;
troy him, regardless of the fate of an affectionate&#xD;
wife and dependent children. Jilis duty compelled&#xD;
him to insist upon a verdict of guilty. The pen-&#xD;
alty, he conceded, was very severe, yet the man who&#xD;
would commit a Penitentiary offence for the sake&#xD;
of three cents worth of liquor, could be of no poe-&#xD;

of indictment for burglary. Upon this charge, if&#xD;
found guilty, you must have been confined for a&#xD;
series of years, in the Penitentiary, and there kept&#xD;
a.t hard, labor-shut out from society-a branded,&#xD;
degraded crimh~al. Your fragile physical consti-&#xD;
tution, which has already begun to give way, from&#xD;
xrour dissolute habits, would probably have sunk&#xD;
beneath the restraint there imposed upon you; and&#xD;
it would, in all human probability, have been your&#xD;
grave. But for an inexcusable blunder on the part&#xD;
of the officer of this Court, charged with preparing&#xD;
the indictment, it would now be my painful duty,&#xD;
in pursuance of the laws of the State, to consign&#xD;
you to a felon's cell; to deprive you of~ liberty; to&#xD;
take from you the blessings of society-7-the atten-&#xD;

you of all that could attach you to life. And I&#xD;
am by no. means satisfied that it would not be bet-&#xD;

for yourself-if that mistake had not occurred.&#xD;
Had you went to prison, in the solitude of your lone&#xD;
cell, you would have had ample time for thought&#xD;
and' meditation; and had you survived the period&#xD;
allotted, you might have come out a better man;&#xD;
and you might, to some extent, be better prepared&#xD;
to resume those duties which you once so faithfully&#xD;
discharged to your family and society. It is true,&#xD;
an indelible mark would have been set upon you,&#xD;
but an honest, upright course of conduct, for a few&#xD;
&#xD;
years, would partially have restored you again to&#xD;
f       the confidence of society; and though you would&#xD;
be in a crippled condition, you could, I doubt not,&#xD;
have passed down the stream of time much more&#xD;
agreeably to yourself, and others with whom you&#xD;
might chance to be connected. II3ut now, you are&#xD;
soon to be mixing again with the world, and by&#xD;
your 'profligate habits, carry pestilence into the&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
Men are but children of a larger growth;&#xD;
Our appetites arc apt to change as theirs,&#xD;
And full as craving too, and full as vain.L~Dryde~i.&#xD;
A few evenings subsequent to Sibley's trial,&#xD;
Judge Alban, Prosecutor Lahm, Sheriff Sikes and&#xD;
four or five members of the bar, met in a saloon,&#xD;
~and after drinking freely, Leblond commenced&#xD;
i~ arratm g Judicial anecdotes, which Judge Alban&#xD;
inunediately rccogniz ~d as a part of his own his-&#xD;
tory. For sornetinie the Judge attempted to i'epel&#xD;
the force of them by an assumed dignity, but it&#xD;
was too thin a covering to conceal his wounded&#xD;
pride. By this time the company was joined by&#xD;
several other legal gemitleniian, who aided in pour-&#xD;
ing in upon the Judge, hot shot from every direc-&#xD;
lion. While some were quoting portions of his&#xD;
charges to the Grand Jury, and other weak sayings&#xD;
~of the Judge, in which he had evidently been court~&#xD;
ing public favor, others were pretending to give&#xD;
the 'Judge's experience and want of success in his&#xD;
political struggles and electioneering schemes.&#xD;
"Now," said the Judge, "a truce to this, and I'll&#xD;
call in the whiskey punch."&#xD;
"Agreed! agreed!" responded the crowd.&#xD;

THE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No," said Leblond, "I must reserve the privi~&#xD;
lege of telling one joke at the Judge's expense."&#xD;
"And I shall insist upon the same right," re-&#xD;
marked Lahm~&#xD;
"I have one that is new," said another, "and&#xD;
has, probably, never been published. I can scarcely&#xD;
agree not to tell it."&#xD;
"Why, d-n it," said the Judge, quite petulently,&#xD;
"you intend to get my whiskey, I suppose, and&#xD;
then continue your annoyance ?"&#xD;
This produced quite a roar of laughter, and&#xD;
loud calls for the hot punch.&#xD;
Presently, the whiskey punch arrived, piping&#xD;
hot, and our professional gentlemen seized it with&#xD;
as much avidity as if it had been the elixir of life,&#xD;
or the dissolved pearls of Cleopatra, while it sa~&#xD;
vored more of the hemlock of Socrates.&#xD;
"Well," said the Judge, with a pompous air,&#xD;
"this reminds us of olden times, when we traveled&#xD;
the circuit on horseback, and after reaching Court,&#xD;
through the mud and over swollen streams, we&#xD;
would try causes all day, and play cards and drink&#xD;
whiskey all night."&#xD;
"I know but little of the usages of other days,"&#xD;
exclaimed Leblond, "but it reminds me forcibly of&#xD;
modern times and recent events."&#xD;
"Perhaps, after all," said the Judge, "there has&#xD;
not been so much change. The bar always drank&#xD;
too much."&#xD;
"How do you account for that?" said LeblondJ&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
153&#xD;
&#xD;
"1 account for it in this way," replied the Judge.&#xD;
"Lawyers frequently attend foreign Courts, where&#xD;
they not only meet their brethren of that particu-&#xD;
lar bar, but of distant bars, and often have but one&#xD;
or two causes, which are not reached upon the&#xD;
calendar for several days, and in the meantime,&#xD;
they are sauntering about town with time hanging&#xD;
heavily upon them; while they are invited to drink&#xD;
often twenty times per day, and after having drank&#xD;
repeatedly and freely, it becomes their turn to treat,&#xD;
which they must do or be thought penurious; so&#xD;
the babit is formed unconsciously. We are terrb&#xD;
bly exposed; terribly, gentlemen, terribly !" While&#xD;
IIC guzzled down his hot punch without seeming&#xD;
t 6 know, or care, what he was saying.&#xD;
"You, I am told, Judge, have heen able to play&#xD;
a strong game at old sledge, poker, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.," said&#xD;
Lahm."&#xD;
"in my younger days," replied the Judge, "I&#xD;
was hard to beat;" swelling to near twice his&#xD;
ordinary dimensions with pure, unmixed dignity.&#xD;
"Indeed? I have understood you lost frequently,&#xD;
and in fact, all you made for many of the first&#xD;
years of your professional life."&#xD;
"Do you intend to insult me sir?"&#xD;
"Not at all," replied Lahm, "but common ru~&#xD;
mor says you were troubled with the shorts, about&#xD;
those times, from that and kindred causes."&#xD;
"I was most cursedly alarmed for Sibley, at one&#xD;

time during the progress of the trial," said the&#xD;
Sheriff. "It looked very much like conviction."&#xD;
"You didn't understand it," said Alban. " Why,&#xD;
do you suppose I would allow a man to be sent to&#xD;
the Penitentiary for stealing three cents' worth of&#xD;
liquor? No, sir! II have too much sympathy for&#xD;
that class of men."&#xD;
"From the manner in which you Ic turned Sibley~&#xD;
I might add, insulted him ; J would readily suppose&#xD;
your bowels of compassion yearned e~ or him&#xD;
But I would be glad to know by what authority y ou&#xD;
could interpose between a cruninol and his fate,&#xD;
when his destiny was fixed beyond cavil, by the&#xD;
testimony and the well settled law of the land ?"&#xD;
Well, sir," said the dodge ; while he seem~ ]&#xD;
to be gathering the ermine around his inflated and&#xD;
polluted person ; "you would have had th~ pleas-&#xD;
ure of witnessing the authority by which I would&#xD;
have interposed between Sibley and his fate, had&#xD;
not your blunder saved me the necessity."&#xD;
"My blunder, as you term it, was innocent, hav-&#xD;
ing resulted from oversight; but, had I averred&#xD;
Johnson the owner of the property, you could not&#xD;
have saved him, and regarded your official oath.&#xD;
You could have committed moral perjury, by a&#xD;
total disregard of that oath, and so you could in&#xD;
every cause tried at bar. But bad the infamous&#xD;
Jeifreys attempted as flagrant an infraction of the&#xD;
law, and disregard of official duty, even the down-&#xD;
trodden people of that iron age, would not have&#xD;
&#xD;
tolerated it. So far as principle and law are con-&#xD;
cerned, I can see no difference between your inter-&#xD;
posing code, and the code of Judge Lynch. You&#xD;
can run riot over law, justice, and equity; as you&#xD;
have the power, and frequently the will-and his&#xD;
Honor, Judge Lynch, can do no more."&#xD;
"There are many things you do not comprehend.&#xD;
You could not, or did not, see the importance of&#xD;
averrm g the warehouse to be the property of John-&#xD;
son. Your pitiful allusion to my peijury fell short&#xD;
of its mark; my feelings are proof against vulgar&#xD;
persoi~alities. I will take care of the jury, and you&#xD;
too, when it shall become necessary."&#xD;
Taking your history," said Lahm, " as the&#xD;
standard by which to judge, I would suppose you&#xD;
about as illy qualified to discharge the important&#xD;
duty of taking care of yourself, as any man in the&#xD;
community in which you have lived. And I would&#xD;
suggest to you the propriety of taking some care&#xD;
of public opinion, which, if t have properly inter-&#xD;
preted the signs of the times, will very soon give&#xD;
you 'fits.' You can have but little idea, I appre-&#xD;
hend, of the deep-toned thunder muttering, every-&#xD;
where heard in disapproval, when you interposed&#xD;
between justice and the negro who committed the&#xD;
outrage upon the young girl, below B. But I med-&#xD;
itated no assault upon your feelings. I am quite&#xD;
too well acquainted with the obtuseness of your&#xD;
sensibility, to attempt anything of the kind. There&#xD;

are some men whose feelings can only be reached&#xD;
by pounding their fingers with a hammer?&#xD;
The Judge was a large corpulent man, and slow&#xD;
in action, as well as in speech; but was leisurely&#xD;
gathering himself up for the encounter. When&#xD;
Lahm, rising to his feet and assuming a belligerent&#xD;
attitude, said: "Permit me to say, sir, you are the&#xD;
greatest judicial tyrant that ever disgraced the&#xD;
bench in ancient or modern times, Lord 'Jeffreys&#xD;
not accepted."&#xD;
Before our worthy Prosecutor had closed his&#xD;
bitter sarcasm, Judge Alban had thrown aside the&#xD;
ermine in a heap, with no inconsiderable amount&#xD;
of his assumed dignity, if he had not done it be-&#xD;
fore, and was upon his feet in a fighting posture,&#xD;
ready for a fisticuffs. And had not an ex-Judge,&#xD;
who happened to be present, interposed, it would&#xD;
have terminated in more than a war of words.&#xD;
Here, the Sheriff proposed an amicable adjust-&#xD;
ment of all differences, over an additional bowl of&#xD;
hot whiskey-punch, at his expense. The Judge&#xD;
and Prosecutor swaggering assent.&#xD;
Leblond insisted that Alban -and Lahm should&#xD;
shake hands, and go through the ridiculous farce&#xD;
of drinking each other's health from the same&#xD;
flask, which he drew from his pocket filled with a&#xD;
choice article of brandy, as a condition precedent&#xD;
to bringing forward the punch. Lahm took the&#xD;
bottle, and before drinking, said: "Here is hoping&#xD;

But added,-in an under tone, distinctly heard by&#xD;
Alban, and all present-" he 'IL have to change&#xD;
like h-~-ll, if he do,"-imrnediately drank, and hand-&#xD;
ed the bottle to Judge Alban; who took it, and af-&#xD;
tei' holding it up and looking at it a moment, said:&#xD;
"Here is regretting that you are what you are, but&#xD;
hoping for a reformation is hoping against possi-&#xD;
bilities."&#xD;
iNow," exclaimed the crowd, as with one voice,&#xD;
"for the punch, for the punch !-ptinch! punch ! !"&#xD;
But the punch was a little tardy, which was unfor-&#xD;
tunate for Leblond's bottle, as it was called for,&#xD;
passed round, and emptied of its contents.&#xD;
At length, the new recruit of punch was on&#xD;
the tapis, and all in silence for sometime contin-&#xD;
ned to sip the nectar, when the stillness of the oc-&#xD;
casio a was interrupted by Lahm remarking, that&#xD;
he had great difficulty in getting witnesses before&#xD;

now, Pm damned if odium for keeping witnesses&#xD;
away from the Grand Jury, shall not lie at the&#xD;
door of somebody. I used every effort in my power&#xD;
to have John Smith, Abner Jay, and others, sub-&#xD;
p~naed before the Grand Jury, but failed. I even&#xD;
went so far as to procure an attachment, which&#xD;
the Court reluctantly granted, but that attachment&#xD;
was never served; and I very much suspect it is&#xD;
still in the hat of Mr. Sheriff, if he has ~ot de-&#xD;
stroyed it.&#xD;
"This thing is all wrong, and the people are in-&#xD;
quiring into the " whys and wherefores," and are&#xD;
not satisfied short of a direct and positive answer,&#xD;
and I am resolved to give it-crinijuate whom it&#xD;
may. Drunkenness is deQimating the land, and&#xD;
fearfully increasing our taxes, and the better por-&#xD;
tion of community are waking up to their true in-&#xD;
terests upon this subject. Why is liquor sold by&#xD;
every grocer, merchant, and tavern, in our town&#xD;
and county, in violation of law, and in defiance of,&#xD;
law, is a question that must be answer; and all&#xD;
I have to say at present is, " stand from under," I&#xD;
am conscious of having done my duty."&#xD;
" You will p1~ the d-l, and smash things,"&#xD;
said the Sheriff.&#xD;
"I shall let the facts be known," retorted Lahm,&#xD;
"and if they shall 'smash' the prospects of some&#xD;
of your drunken deputies, and nip their hopes of&#xD;
promotion to the Sheriffalty, you must blame it&#xD;
upon their failure, to discharge their duty."&#xD;

"Would it not be well for you," said Alban, "to&#xD;
wait until you. get sober before you commence lec~&#xD;
touring on temperance? It is silly nonsense for you&#xD;
to assume so sa.intly a position. 'We all know&#xD;
you, and your habits; and th~t you have derived&#xD;
as much political aid from winking' at that sin, and&#xD;

worse than if be had stolen his property; and&#xD;
through the night following, gamble and become&#xD;

Judge Alban, pleased with the prospect of more&#xD;
liquor, remarked, it has been said, 'music hath&#xD;
charms to soothe a savage '-though he repelled&#xD;
the idea that they were savages, yet he thought it&#xD;
might have a beneficial influence upon their angry,&#xD;
turbulent passions, and make them in love with&#xD;
all about them; and that he would, thereibre, give&#xD;

cordingly, went off into one of those happy moods&#xD;
which always indicates the amoiint of canvass he&#xD;
had flung to the breeze.&#xD;
"Judge," said Leblond, "you are of Scotch ex-&#xD;

"'Yes," answered Alban, as he swelled like the&#xD;
toad in the fable: "I am a lineal descendent from&#xD;
that noble, noble woman -' Mary, Queen of&#xD;

"A descendent of kings, eh?" retorted Lahm.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Alban, "more-of Queens."&#xD;
"Ye gods !" paid Lahm: "how the blood has&#xD;

&#xD;
What is the benefit, when our appearance as well&#xD;
as our actions, stamp us every inch a plebian?&#xD;
'Tis silly; oh, it is ludicrous, in this plain republi-&#xD;
can country, to attempt to borrow importance from&#xD;
the nobility of a fictitious ancestry.&#xD;
~'\TiPtiie alone, is true nobility"&#xD;
True worth and " modest merit" never take airs&#xD;
and assume dignity because of the pecuniary, or&#xD;
intellectual, distinction of ancestry; and where&#xD;
that spirit is manifested, it can with entire confi-&#xD;
dence be regarded as evidence, conclusive that&#xD;
their fathers belonged to the vulgar herd, and not&#xD;

f~r very far removed from the parent stock."&#xD;
Alban was in a position, anything but pleasant,&#xD;
yet his folly his weakness-had invoked it, and&#xD;
hence he had to submit as best he could.&#xD;
The Judge was a man of fair intellect, an d hi&#xD;
early life, was pos~e~.sed of generous and manly&#xD;
impulses; but in consequence of domestic vex a-&#xD;
tion, and political disappointment, hi~ temper had&#xD;
become soured, and it occasionally appeared to&#xD;
carry a secret joy to his heart to be able to vent&#xD;
his spleen upon some unfortunate individual com-&#xD;
pletely in his power.~ lie never was known to at-&#xD;
tack any person, unless he was protected by his&#xD;
privilege as Attorney or Judge, from reply; and&#xD;
his refined and elevated pleasures were drawn&#xD;
from the pain he inflicted upon others, and the&#xD;
more excruciating, the more extatic his enjoyment.&#xD;
Lawyers, from some cause not yet understood&#xD;
--probably from habit-have a practice of getting&#xD;
their feet upon a table, stove, or any thing that&#xD;
may chance to be in their neighborhood more ele-&#xD;
vated than the seat upon which they are, at&#xD;
the time, sitting. This pi~actice the Judge re-&#xD;
garded as not strictly Chesterfieldian, and there-&#xD;
fore, attempted to break up the habit, which afibrd-&#xD;
edone of the most laughable, not to say ludicrous&#xD;
scenes, we ever remember to have witnessed. It&#xD;
reminded us of an old-fashioned Irish pedagogue,&#xD;
hectoring his half frightened urchins. While dc~~&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
livening an opinion in an important case he would&#xD;
stop and exclaim, "your feet off the table, sir!"&#xD;
Down went the feet, but in the course of a few&#xD;
minutes, some member who had been engaged du-&#xD;
ring the previous reprimand, would throw himself&#xD;
back into his chair, and up would go his feet upon&#xD;
the counsel table; then, the Court would come&#xD;
down upoh him, with " Your feet off the table, sir !"&#xD;
He loved t-o indulge, when partially intoxicated, in&#xD;
vital stabs at Private character, by dark insinua.&#xD;
tions and meaning glances, but lacked the manli~&#xD;
ness and courage for an open and direct attack~;&#xD;
and thus was he engaged, frequently, in under-&#xD;
fining, insidiously, the character and standing of&#xD;
certain members of the bar.&#xD;
his honor J)ossessed another imperfection, in&#xD;
common with the rest of the human race. WhiIe&#xD;
all men love that delicious aliment called flatters,&#xD;
.1 udge Alban had this rascally virtue in a most pre-&#xD;
eminent degree. It may be said, with truth, that&#xD;
the entire Adamic race are fond of flattery, and that&#xD;
the only difference between men consists in this,&#xD;
that while you must serve it up exceedingly delicate&#xD;
for some, you can pitch it down the throats~of oth-&#xD;
ers with a barn-floor shovel; and to the latter class&#xD;
belonged the Judge. The coarser the article the&#xD;
more agreeable to his taste. This frailty of his&#xD;
honor was the only avenue through which he could&#xD;
be approached with any tolerable degree of&#xD;

"Of praise a mere glutton, lie swallowed what carn~,&#xD;
And the puff of a dunce, he mistook it for fame,&#xD;
Till his relish grew callous almost to disease;&#xD;
Who peppered the highest was surest to please."&#xD;
The acumen of the bar, in different portions of&#xD;
the circuit, was not slow to discover this xveakness&#xD;
of the Judge; and hence, it was not uncommon to&#xD;
hear, on the trial of unimportant as well as the&#xD;
most important causes, the grossest flattery flung&#xD;
in the face of his honor, for the purpose of secur-&#xD;
ing his favor and carrying a l)Oint. That which&#xD;
would have called up a blush on the cheek of mod-&#xD;
osty, xvas gulp~l down with greediness by Alhai~,&#xD;
and regarded as more w~'ighty than poxverful logic,&#xD;
consecutive argument, or oven indisputable author-&#xD;
ities.&#xD;
The Judge had, in evei~y county of his district,&#xD;
one or two favorites; generally the more unscru-&#xD;

took po~sessicn of his heart, controlled his judg-&#xD;

their causes frequently sacrificed; and when com-&#xD;
pelled to carry their causes into a higher court in&#xD;
oi~der to obtain justice, Judge Alban would often&#xD;
Thllow them and manifest all the anxiety to sustain&#xD;

advocates of zealous, sanguine temperaments, with&#xD;
an eye single to success, without reference to jus-&#xD;

Have you heard the difficulty into which A. P.&#xD;
Jewett has got himself?" said a sprightly young&#xD;
lawyer to judge Jones as he drove up to the door&#xD;
of a hotel, in one of the western villages of the&#xD;
State.&#xD;
"No," quickly replied Jones, "what difficulty,&#xD;
pray, has he got into?"&#xD;
"So, you have heard nothing about it?"&#xD;
'~ No, certainly not," sai(l the Judge, impatient&#xD;
to learn the character of Jewett's trouble.&#xD;
Then," said his informant, "you had better go&#xD;
immediately to the jail and learn the fa&amp;amp;ts from&#xD;
himself."&#xD;
"Jewett in jail !" exclaimed Judge Jones.-~&#xD;
"What, upon earth, does all this mean?"&#xD;
Certainly, he is," replied the young man.&#xD;
The Judge, without further delay, repaired to the&#xD;
jail, and found Jewett in prison, and learned from&#xD;
him the cause of his " capture and detention."&#xD;
Jewett, for several weeks had been perambula-&#xD;
ting the State, electioneering for Ju(lg~.Jo nes; and&#xD;
&#xD;
in his travels, he caine in contact with those of the&#xD;
Judge's opponents who were circulating against&#xD;
him the charge of his intemperance, as well as&#xD;
those who were repelling the charge; and among&#xD;
the latter he found, or imagined he found it ne~&#xD;
cessary to take an occasional dram; and being&#xD;
unaccostomed to drinking, it produced the impres-&#xD;
5Lon, where he was unknown, that he himself was&#xD;
addicted to intemperance.&#xD;
But, as the Judge and Jcwett are now together,&#xD;
Jewett must be permitted to give his own account&#xD;
of the matter..&#xD;
"Why, What in heaven's name are you doing&#xD;
here? enquired Jones.&#xD;
Well, Judge," said Jewett, "I am truly glad&#xD;
to see you, whether I have gotten into trouble re-&#xD;
mains to be seen."&#xD;
But,~' exclaimed the Judge, "how, and by what&#xD;
possible means did they get you into prison?"&#xD;
In passing through the State," said Jewett, "1&#xD;
occasionally find it necessary to get up the impres-&#xD;
sion that you are persecuted-that the temperance&#xD;
organizations are bringing all their appliances to&#xD;
bear upon you. rrhat they have singled you out&#xD;
from among a host of candidates with a view of&#xD;
striking down your character and prostrating you&#xD;
forever. And for the purpose of showing my con-&#xD;

&#xD;
and up North, some fourteen miles, while pretty&#xD;
well "fuddled," Tom harris came along and&#xD;
charged me with being drunk, and added that it.&#xD;
was very appropriate for one drunken loafer to&#xD;
electioneer for another. Thereupon, while under&#xD;
the influence of a violent fit of passion. I immedi~&#xD;
ately wrote him to meet me at such time and place,&#xD;
and with such weapons as he might designate, and&#xD;
I would chastise him for his insolence; and incred-&#xD;
ible as it may appear, the cowardly puppy, instead&#xD;
of accepting the challenge, immediately filed his&#xD;
affidavit, and I was required to enter into a recogn-&#xD;
izance of two thousand dollars, and in default, to&#xD;
be committed to jail. Being wholly unacquainted&#xD;
in this section of the State, I. of course, could not&#xD;
give the required bail; hence, your honor finds me&#xD;
in jail, not quite as calm as a May morning. had&#xD;
I kept myself perfectly sober, as I ought to have&#xD;
done, this terrible disgrace would not have hap-&#xD;
pened to me."&#xD;
"I have no distinct recollection of the precise&#xD;
character of the challenge, as I was both angry&#xD;
and intoxicated when I penned it; and at the time&#xD;
of my arrest and commitment, I was still under&#xD;
the influence of liquQr; so II was incapable of fully&#xD;
knowit~g and appreciating what was transpiring&#xD;
arour~d me; but I have no doubt it comes within.&#xD;
the purview of the. statute; ar~d, from the cowardly&#xD;
and malignat feeling Iharris has manifested, he&#xD;
~i1l car~r this criminal proceeding a fearful length~&#xD;
&#xD;
Can I escape conviction? I must confess I am&#xD;
~rc~ tly alarmed, and can see no hope if ik shall&#xD;
be prosecuted. I would be unwilling to derive&#xD;
any benefit from the plea of. drunkenness, even if&#xD;
it were available. I will never attempt to shield&#xD;
myself from the consequences of one crime, by&#xD;
taking shelter under another. I would as soon go&#xD;
to the Penitentiary as urge my incapacity to com-&#xD;
mit crime from (Irunkenness."&#xD;
You have, really, got into serious trouble. It&#xD;
is most unfortunate. I know that harris is a most&#xD;
unprincipled villain," continued Judge Jones, "and&#xD;
have frequently wondered how such a creature,&#xD;
fit for treason, stratagem, and spoils," got in-&#xD;
to the profession he so shamefully digraces. lie,&#xD;
as well as the scamp who certified for him at the&#xD;
time of his admission, ought to be throwif over the&#xD;
bar for want of integrity and moral worth."&#xD;
"Judge," said Jewett, " our wonder at the ad-&#xD;
mission of such men into an honorable and liberal&#xD;
profession, abates when we recollect that a Judas&#xD;
was in the cabinet of the Saviour of the World ."&#xD;
"While you ~vere narrating the facts of your&#xD;
case," said Judge Jones, " I was trying to con-&#xD;
ceive of a defence. and have been entirely unable&#xD;
to satisfy myself with any you can interpose with&#xD;
safety, and have finally determined the case must&#xD;
never come to trial."&#xD;
How is it to be avoided ?" inquired Jewett.&#xD;
~' Every ma.m~ has his price," replied the Judgc~&#xD;

harris must be bought oil'. rl llat challenge must&#xD;
be destroyed, and the prosecution suppressed.&#xD;
That is your only salvation."&#xD;
"In making that arrangeine ut, Judge," said&#xD;
.Tewett, "you must take into the account the fact,&#xD;
that fortune has never smiled propitiously upon&#xD;
your humble servant, except by furnishing him&#xD;
with a very liberal share of baby responsibilities,&#xD;
which in a negotiation, such as you speak of,&#xD;
would not be 'a present help in time of need.'"&#xD;
You must be cut loose from this dilemma, cost&#xD;
what it may. And, of course, it would neither&#xD;
be manly nor honest in me to let you pay the pen-&#xD;
alty of my dereliction to duty. That I must be&#xD;
permitted to settle " continued Jones, "entirely&#xD;
myself as a pai't of the ~)unishment due on the 01(1&#xD;
score of getting drunk on the hlainlin trial."&#xD;
But, Judge," said Jewelt, "this expenditure&#xD;
which you are now contemplating, would not, and&#xD;
could no~ have been required, had I maintained&#xD;
the character due my position on the temperance&#xD;
question; and, therefore, I ought, at least, to be&#xD;
allowed to divide the expense with you."&#xD;
"Not at all, sir!" instantly replied Judge Jones.&#xD;
" You are not to make any additional sacrifice---&#xD;
no more immolations upon the altar of my folly.&#xD;
Had I maintained the character~ due the position I&#xD;
occupie(l, you would not have been called upon to&#xD;
aeriflee principle, and could not upon my account,&#xD;

The Judge returned to th~ hotel, and after par-&#xD;
taking of some refi~eshments di~ew up the applica-&#xD;
tion for the allowance of the writ ; carried it to th~&#xD;
jail and l~roeured vhe~signature of Jewett; allowed&#xD;
the writ to issue ; and, in a very short period, Jew-&#xD;

one hundred dollars, for which Jones became&#xD;
personally responsible to the individual who bailed&#xD;
Judge,~' enqui~'ed Jewett, " would it not have&#xD;
been better to have put the bail bond at least one&#xD;

two thousand, and I very much fear your enemies&#xD;
will manufacture some capital against you out of&#xD;
the fact, that you have Ict me to bail upon a mere&#xD;

twy used it to your disadvantage. If it happen&#xD;

your bond so low, I supposed was apparent to you.&#xD;
In case we shall find ourselves unable to reach&#xD;
harris, and should be compelled to forfeit your bond,&#xD;
one hundred dollars is a little matter, and will&#xD;

" That is all true, Ju(lge, but it is yet some time&#xD;

both moderately and immoderately, are enlistedjn&#xD;
my favor. Their name is legion. You will find,&#xD;
sir, they will come up to the ballot box, from hill&#xD;
top and valley, Hamlet and village, town and city&#xD;
&#xD;
-all over the State, and deposit their votes for&#xD;
me without distinction of party."&#xD;
"You are more of a politician then I, yet, I fear&#xD;
you are calculating without your host; and," con-&#xD;
tinued Jewett, "the class of voters, upon which you&#xD;
are relying, often constitute a kind of floating vote,&#xD;
and frequently take a "stampede," and there is no&#xD;
controlling' them&#xD;
This very circumstance, if hand-billed over the&#xD;
State, might have the effect to create the "stani-&#xD;
pede," and defeat your election."&#xD;
Our two friends had now reached the Judge's&#xD;
I~OOifl.&#xD;
Jones rang for the servant, and ordered two bran~&#xD;
dy slings; then turning to Jewctt remarked that&#xD;
he had made up his mind to break off entirely, and&#xD;
never a~'a&#xD;

ITo ~vent on to say, he had been drinking for many&#xD;
years, and during all that period he had not got&#xD;
into any trouble, nor had he been sick, or met&#xD;
with aiiy misfortune, that he could not, upon re-&#xD;
hectioi, trace directly, or indirectly, to his indis-&#xD;
cretions in the use of alcoholic drinks.&#xD;
4       "1," said Jewett, "have had but little personal&#xD;
experience in the use of liquors, but from that lit-&#xD;
lIe, I am inclined to think its use more than a&#xD;
Pandora's box-that it is the source of universal&#xD;
evil."&#xD;

"Intemperance, like the fearful siroc's blast.&#xD;
spreads in its course, ruin, devastation, desolation.&#xD;
and death. The brightest human interests, (Lfl(l&#xD;
the fairest prospects of imperishable fame, are&#xD;
nipped in the bud; and even the sanctity of our&#xD;
hopes beyond the tomb are invaded by this fell&#xD;
d istroycr."&#xD;
Notwithstanding I have been guilty of very&#xD;
many follies, tp use the mildest possible term for&#xD;
it," said Jones, "while under the influence of liquor.&#xD;
yet I cannot' say I now or ever loved the taste of&#xD;
spirituous, or malt liquors, of any description&#xD;
Nor can I say that the c~xhi1erating or exciting ef~&#xD;
feds produced by it, so very pleasant to some, has&#xD;
even been agreeable to me.&#xD;
"My drinking has been on account of irresohi-&#xD;
tion-want of decision-because I have never&#xD;
learned to pronounce the little monosyllable "noi&#xD;
The most important word in the English language.&#xD;
and yet the most difficult to pronounce."&#xD;
The brandy now before them, they drank with&#xD;
apparent relish; and why? We have just heard&#xD;
from Judge Jones that he had neither a natural nor&#xD;
acquired fondness for it, and we are bound to sup-&#xD;

Woman~ lovely wonmu! Nature madc thee&#xD;
To temper man; we ha4 becu brutes without thee.&#xD;
0/way.&#xD;
"I have always maintained, Mr. Tompkins,&#xD;
that moral suasion was the remedy, and the only&#xD;
remedy, in this enlightened age, and country of&#xD;
freedom of thought and action, for the correction of&#xD;
certain vices and prominent among them, was&#xD;
intemperance; "but, a change has come o'er the&#xD;
spirit of my dream.'&#xD;
"Ah, indeed! May I inquire, what has been the&#xD;
character of that change? Well, I trust that it is&#xD;
not about to spoil a good wife and make a poor&#xD;
politician," replied Tompkins, to a dignified and&#xD;
highly cultivated lady, about the meridian of life,&#xD;
who had the honor of calling him her lord and&#xD;
master.&#xD;
No sir," said Mrs. Tompkins. "I shall at all&#xD;
times endeavor to take care of these little responsi-&#xD;
bilities of ours, and see that your rtieals are pre-&#xD;
pared in order and in season, and that other house-&#xD;
hold duties are properly attended to; and yet II&#xD;
hope to have the privilege of expressing my oprn-&#xD;
ions upon great moral questions involving the hap-&#xD;
&#xD;
pnwSS, here and hereafter, of millions of human&#xD;
souls."&#xD;
"But, my dear, you have still left me in the dark,&#xD;
as to the nature of the change of which you have&#xD;
spoken. Yea must not assume the character of&#xD;
a "strong minded woman" and aspire to the ele~&#xD;
vated position of a leader in the affairs of State.&#xD;
That would be thwarting nature, and when nature&#xD;
is perverted, disorder ensues."&#xD;
"You must not, my dear husband, expect to&#xD;
evade the discussion of the temperance question,&#xD;
hy attempting to get up an issue with me as to the&#xD;
rights of women. I have no discussion with you&#xD;
as to woman 's right, or ability to rule and govern&#xD;
the State, at this time. If agreeable to you, upon&#xD;
some future occasion, you can have my views upon&#xD;
that subject."&#xD;
"But for the 'change that has come o'er the&#xD;
spirit of your dream,' upon the temperance ques-&#xD;
tion. If that must be discussed, let us g'et at it im-&#xD;
mediately. It will not, probably, occupy but a few&#xD;
minutes ;" somewhat tartly responded Tompkins.&#xD;
"To come directly to the point, then, Mr. Temp..&#xD;
kins, I am no longer in favor of moral suasion for&#xD;
the restraint of intemperance. Its mission and&#xD;
purpose has been fulfilled. It has spent its force,&#xD;
and it has done much. To refuse to go further is&#xD;
to retrograde in this great moral. enterprise. It is&#xD;

not in the nature of reformations to be stationary.&#xD;
I am, therefore, in favor of legal suasion. And,&#xD;
by the time legal suasion has spent - its force and&#xD;
closed its mission, the greatest emissary his satanic&#xD;
majesty ever commissioned and sent forth to ruin&#xD;
and destroy, will have breathed his expiring groan."&#xD;
Why, that is quite a speech," said Tompkins.&#xD;
Well, my dear, you "make quite a speech,"&#xD;
and II will make another. I have enlisted for life&#xD;
in this cause," replied Mrs. Tompkins.&#xD;
"You reason correctly from your pi'omises, but&#xD;
are they correct? Is it true that moral suasion&#xD;
has spent its force?"&#xD;
"I aver, most solemnly, that I believe it has spent&#xD;
all the force it possessed in shaping the views and&#xD;
sentimentS of that Portion of society, willing to&#xD;
listen to the voice of reason, which I am happy to&#xD;
say, constitutes a large and decided majority in&#xD;
this, and indeed, in all other countries where wis-&#xD;
dom and virtue' are predominant among thc&#xD;
masses. That portion of our citizens who are&#xD;
deaf to the voice of reason, and who from avarice,&#xD;
~r some baser passion, are unwilling to desist from&#xD;
their traffic in spirituous liquors, notwithstanding&#xD;
the moral deadi that follows as connectedly as ef-&#xD;
fect follows cause; must be restrained by the strong&#xD;
~ 1&#xD;
arm of the law. Treat such men as enemies of&#xD;
the public p~ace and welfare. Public policy re~&#xD;
quires it. The good of community requires it.-&#xD;
&#xD;
The welfare and happiness~temporal and eter-&#xD;
nal-of unborn millions demand it.&#xD;
"So, there, Mr. Tompkins, is another speech&#xD;
for you; and as you have not answered the first,&#xD;
if you decline answering- this also, I will make&#xD;
still another."&#xD;
"May I inquire, when you experienced this&#xD;
change, my dear?" said Tompkins, with more&#xD;
sane- froid, than suited the pride of his better part.&#xD;
"I first began to view this subject in the light&#xD;
in which I now look at it, some ten days since,&#xD;
when I happened to be at our neighbor Dudley's,&#xD;
across the way. lie had carried every thing out&#xD;
of the house that would purchase a glass of liquor&#xD;
for him; and finally, just before I dropped in, he&#xD;
had taken a small pocket-Bible lie had presented&#xD;
her before she wore his dishonorable name, and&#xD;
old it to the grocery~keeper for two shillings worth&#xD;
£ liquor, and was then lying in the back yard,&#xD;
under a shed, so drunk that he could neither sit nor&#xD;
~4and; and that at the cost of the only Thble in the&#xD;
house; while poor Mrs. Dudley was overwhelmed&#xD;
~ grief at the loss of it. What a dark l~icture is&#xD;
spread out before her; and, how slight the hope that&#xD;
her condition will assume a more favorable phase!&#xD;
"Now, please tell me," continued Mrs. Tomp-&#xD;
kins, "how long you might preach faith and re~&#xD;
entrance to two such degraded specimens of hu-&#xD;
manity, as Dudley and the wretch to whom h~&#xD;
sold the Bible."&#xD;

"I will concede," said Tompkins~ "that preaching,&#xD;
in the case you put, would be a little like casting&#xD;
p earls before ~uneE&#xD;
"How are they to be reached? There are hut&#xD;
two ways~pCr5Ua5iO~~ and law-by which they can&#xD;
be reached; if the former is not effectual, ~esort&#xD;
must be had to the latter. humanity, to say noth-&#xD;

be permitted to murder another; slowly, it is true,&#xD;
but certainlY."&#xD;

said Tompkifl5~ in an und~~ and rather subdued&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"With the consent of the injured, cli? The&#xD;
man who takes advantage of the minor, or an in-&#xD;
sane person~ invariably does it with the consent of&#xD;
the injured yet the law, I believe, steps in and&#xD;
says, these injured individuals are incapable of&#xD;
giving their consent, and compels the dishonest&#xD;
man to disgorge his ill-gotten gain. The man who&#xD;
meets you upon the highway, and with a pistol at&#xD;
your breast, demands your money, gets it with&#xD;
your consent. You choose between two evils and&#xD;
surrender the money in preference to surrendering&#xD;
your life. You will insist that in the last case&#xD;
put, the man was under duress. Who, we inquire,&#xD;
is more effectually under duress, than the unfortu-&#xD;
nate man who is a slave to his passions-ifflPri5&#xD;
oned by a depraved and vitiated appetite? lie&#xD;
as much entitled to the protection of the law as&#xD;
&#xD;
the minor, the lunatic, or the man met upon the&#xD;
I ugh way.&#xD;
"Now do tell me whether the country is not full&#xD;
of such cases? Anti whether they are not as far&#xD;
beyond the reach of public opinion, as the men&#xD;
who will steal or rob ? In either case, you can&#xD;
alone reach them by heavy penal enactments.".&#xD;
"Well, that makes four speeches, and if I (10&#xD;
not soon make one, you will imagine they are un-&#xD;
answerable. What have you to say to the hun-&#xD;
dreds and hundreds of men, in different parts of&#xD;
the State, wl~o have all they ~OSSC55 in the world,&#xD;
invested in liquors? Must they pour out their sub-&#xD;
stance, and be reduced to penury and want ?"&#xD;
"There is this Iexv to be taken of that state of&#xD;
hings. The men who invest their means in the&#xD;
business of dealing in liquors, are in no worse&#xD;
condition than the man who throws a dam ~eross&#xD;
a stream of water, below which he constructs a val-&#xD;
uable mill and m achinery-prodiices stagnation,&#xD;
and thereby generates malaria, causing disease&#xD;

the law would abate the i~uisance, without refer-&#xD;
ence to the amount invested in the erection of the&#xD;

&#xD;
"Let me, in closing, again urge you, by all that&#xD;
is high on earth or holy in heaven, earnestly to ad-&#xD;
vocate this law. If this traffic is stopped, drunken-&#xD;
ness must stop from necessity, and misery, wretch-&#xD;
edness, and crime, lessen from the same cause.&#xD;
Enlist in it, and you have the, prayers of thou-&#xD;
sands, while the curses of the drunkard will recoil&#xD;
in blessings upon his own head.&#xD;
I am, my dear sir,&#xD;
Very truly,&#xD;

While reading the above letter, Tompkins se-&#xD;
cretly determined to use all honorable means in&#xD;
his power to procure the passage of the law, and&#xD;
let consequences take care of themselves.&#xD;
After he had read the letter, he handed it to his&#xD;
wife, who perused it attentively; and, while fold~&#xD;
ing it, she looked her husband imploringly in the&#xD;
face, and said, ~Mr. Tompkins, 'you will support&#xD;
the Temperance bill, won't you?"&#xD;
Tompkins admired the disinterested devotion&#xD;
his wife was giving this benevolent measure. She&#xD;
had actually changed his views upon this impor-&#xD;
tant subject; for which he had the manliness to&#xD;
give her the credit.&#xD;
"Mary," said Tompkins," I have no doubt I can&#xD;
effect the passage of the Maine Liquor Law&#xD;
through the Senate. Different Senators are in&#xD;
doubt as to how they ought to vote upon this bill,&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours,&#xD;
And ask them what report they've l)orfle to heaven,&#xD;
And how they might have borne more welcome news.&#xD;
iOl~flq,&#xD;
Sibley had now nearly finished the period fur&#xD;
which he was consigned to prison, when, as soon&#xD;
as the outer door of the jail xvas opened, in the&#xD;
morning, one of his boys appeared at the door of&#xD;
his cell, and informed him that his little son which&#xD;
his brutality had exposed to the inclemency of the&#xD;
weather, was a corpse~&#xD;
Stung by remorse, and lashed by a guilty con-&#xD;
science, he raved for several successive hours like&#xD;
a maniac. Alternately praying God for mercy,&#xD;
and imprecating the vengeance of heaven upon&#xD;
the jailor, for not throwing open the door of the&#xD;
prison and allowing him to attend his child's funeral.&#xD;
He would prostrate himself upon the prison' floor,&#xD;
and beseech the man in "brief authority," to let&#xD;
him out, if but for two hours; and would pledge&#xD;
himself, by all that was sacred, to return to his&#xD;
confinement as soon as he had performed this last&#xD;
solemn duty to his departed infant. When all&#xD;
other arguments had failed, he proposed serving&#xD;
him for the period of five years, in the most menial&#xD;
&#xD;
capacity, if he would allow him to follow the re-&#xD;
mains of his child to its grave.&#xD;
But the Jailor, who had become callous-hearted,5&#xD;
~nd lost to the better feelings of our nature, from&#xD;
habitual intemperance, remained inexorable; and&#xD;
poor Sibley, during the afternoon, was doomed to&#xD;
the mortification of seeing, through his iron-grated&#xD;
window, the funeral procession pass his prison.&#xD;
Sibley spent the few remaining days in prison,&#xD;
reviewing his past life; and frequently did differ-&#xD;
~nt members of his family, on visiting him, find&#xD;
him bathed in tears.&#xD;
"Acquaint thee with thyself, 0 man! so shalt thou b~ humble,&#xD;
Ilie hard, hot desert of thy heart shall blossom with the lilly and the&#xD;
rose&#xD;
Flie frozen cliffs of pride shall melt as an iceberg in the tropics&#xD;
The bitter fountains of self -seekiug, be sweeter than the waters of the&#xD;
Nile."&#xD;
From the retrospect, he discovered the indiscretion&#xD;
and the weakness that led him into folly, dissipa-&#xD;
tion and crime, and resolved with all the firmness&#xD;
and resolution he had left, to avoid, in the future,&#xD;
folly and dissipation by guarding against their pio-&#xD;
neer, indiscretion.&#xD;
As soon as his liberty was restoi~ed, he returned&#xD;
to his family, believing himself ~ changed man,&#xD;
and was so regarded by his friends and neighbors;&#xD;
and after the lapse of a few days opened an office,&#xD;
and vigorously entered upon the duties of his pro-&#xD;
fession. Business began to flow in upon him, and&#xD;
he found men of influence and position in society&#xD;

&#xD;
among his patrons and friends-men who, a few&#xD;
brief weeks previously, would not, upon credit,&#xD;
have sold him a pound of coffee, were now willing&#xD;
ing to endorse for him to the amount of hun-&#xD;
dreds of dollars, so great was their confidence&#xD;
in the permanency of his reformation. lie pur-&#xD;
chased a lot of ground, and erected upon it a com-&#xD;
fortable little home for his family. Again he was&#xD;
respectable ami happy. Peace and plenty were&#xD;
once more inmates of that recently desolate house.&#xD;
Some two months after Sibley's reformation, a&#xD;
term of the Supreme Court was holden in his vil-&#xD;
lage, and a number of young men were admitted&#xD;
to the bar; and, as was the custom, they gave " a&#xD;
bail supper," to whieh Sibley was honored with an&#xD;
invitation.&#xD;
After some hesitancy, and much urgency upon&#xD;
the part of his wife, he consented and attended&#xD;
the supper.&#xD;
Sibley found the Court, the officers of ~he Court,&#xD;
and his old friends and associates at the bar, ready&#xD;
to greet him with the warmth of renewed friend-&#xD;
ship.&#xD;
Supper being over, any quantity of bottles was&#xD;
introduced, containing e very variety and descrip -&#xD;
tion of liquors that modern invention has been&#xD;
able to produce.&#xD;
Judge Alban, presiding, drank a toast, which,&#xD;
for the credit of the bench, we would gladly sup-&#xD;
press; but, as we profess to be accurate in our nar-&#xD;
&#xD;
ration of the facts, necessity compels us to give it&#xD;
as nearly as we can recollect, which is as follows:&#xD;
"The improvement in liquors in this age of ad-&#xD;
vanceinent, has kept pace with the discoveries in&#xD;
steam and electricity; and palsied be the arm that&#xD;
would stay their onward progress. Blessed be the&#xD;
man who invented eating and drinking'"&#xD;
Three cheevs for Judge Alban were called for&#xD;
and given with deafening applause.&#xD;
Sibley, being the eldest member of the bar pres-&#xD;
ent, was next called upon for a toast. lie rose~&#xD;
and with great calmness and deliberation took up&#xD;
his glass; aiid from a mug of sparkling cold water,&#xD;
that stood near, filled it to the brim, and drank a~&#xD;
follows:&#xD;
"Pure cold water; the only beverage fit for man&#xD;
or beast; and he who advocates any other, must&#xD;
sink in the estimation of virtuous men and women,&#xD;
while the curses of heaven will ~rest upon him and&#xD;
his posterity."&#xD;
For several seconds, after offering the above&#xD;
sentiment, Sibley stood pale and motionless, while&#xD;
th~ house was as silent as the chamber of death.&#xD;
At length Sibley broke the stillness of the occasion&#xD;
in the following strain:&#xD;
"Mr. PRESJDENT-~--I know I will not in. vain ask&#xD;
the indulgence of my friends present, for a few&#xD;
moments, while I briefly give my re~son~ for offer-&#xD;
ing this sentiment,"&#xD;

Mr. Sibley," quickly replied Alban, *" this is&#xD;
not a Temperance meeting. You are out of order&#xD;
and cannot proceed."&#xD;
Leblond rose and. said, he felt inclined to go any&#xD;
reasonable length, by way of indulging his brother&#xD;
Sibley, but this was no occasion for a temperance&#xD;
lecture ; and, therefore, hoped he would desist fr )ifl&#xD;
fu~ tiler trespassing up on their patience.&#xD;
Some gentleman, present, moved that Sibley be&#xD;

Have I a true friend who would throw this cable&#xD;

you are a man of talents, and ought to be a man&#xD;
of sense.' Now, will you not aid me in attempting&#xD;
to be 'a man of ~ense?'"&#xD;
Alban, by this time, was too drunk to appreciate&#xD;
the appeal or even understand the hit.&#xD;
"A man," continued Sibley, "under the infin-&#xD;
ence of this vice, is like homer's giant quaffing&#xD;
from the goblet of Ulysses, cr~ ing 'more, give me&#xD;

"1 appeal to you, then, as men-as members of&#xD;

"'Will you give up your cups and sign the tem-&#xD;

"We will! We are ready to help you K Bring&#xD;

Sibley drew from his pocket a temperance pledge&#xD;
which read as follows:&#xD;
"NYc, the undersigned members of the bar, and&#xD;

To the above pledge, Sibley signed his name,&#xD;

Leblond, Alban, and several others, the meeting&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
When impious mew bear sway,&#xD;
The post of honor is a private StatiOll.--Add~SOu.&#xD;
in a large and splendidly furnished room, at one&#xD;
of the most fashionable hotels in the city of ~,&#xD;
a few days after the election, might have been&#xD;
seen Judge Jones, Leblond, Judge Alb an, and Jew-&#xD;
ett, with numerous other distinguished politicians&#xD;
of the State, with a table in their midst, covered&#xD;
with all kinds of hiquoim&#xD;
"Jones," said Leblond, "you must either regard&#xD;
me as a prophet, or a man of great political sa-&#xD;
gacity; and I believe I should prefer the latter. I&#xD;
told you, you remember, that the hanging matter,&#xD;
up North, if adroitly managed, would elect you&#xD;
and, now let me add, that alone saved you4"&#xD;
"Well," replied Jones, "Mr. Leblond, you do&#xD;
not, in that opiniQn, pay a very high compliment&#xD;
to the virtue of the people."&#xD;
"That may be true," said Leblond; "yet, such&#xD;
is the fact. And neither you nor myself ought to&#xD;
quarrel with those imperfections of our nature&#xD;
xvhich we have seized upon, pressed into our ranks,&#xD;
and from which we have gained such sig~ial ad-&#xD;
vantage."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Leblond," replied Judge Jones, "I do not think&#xD;
it very creditable, to either of u~,to have it said&#xD;
that the better portion of our fellow citizens were&#xD;
against us in the contest, and that we were sup-&#xD;
ported by the less respectable and virtuous because&#xD;
xx' e were kindred spirits."&#xD;
Leblond remarked that he felt free to acknowb&#xD;
edge the deep debt of gratitude he was under to&#xD;
the bottle, and its influence for his election; and&#xD;
that it was a part of his nature never to abandon&#xD;
his friends. He had nothing further to say as to&#xD;
the influences that brought about the Judge's elec-&#xD;
tion; seeing that he took it in high dudgeon.&#xD;
I," said the Judge, " acknowledged no indebt-&#xD;
edness to the bottle, and have no league with vice."&#xD;
Yes," said Leblond, "you are now out of the&#xD;
woods, you can afford to be saintly."&#xD;
Leblond, I am at all times just what I appear&#xD;
to be. My enemies, though they have followed&#xD;
me with the ferocity of blood-hounds, have, never&#xD;
dared charge me with dissimulation or hypocrisy.&#xD;
'hypocrisy is the necessary burden of villainy.'"&#xD;
"Judge Jones, do you intimate that I am a vib&#xD;
lain, sir ?" said Leblouid, with much feeling.&#xD;
"By no means," answered Jones. I merely re-&#xD;
pelled the charge of hypocrisy, and called it vil-&#xD;
lainy. And I am wholly unable to see by what&#xD;
rule of construction you could infer a charge of&#xD;
villainy against you; and I am quite as unable to&#xD;
account for your sensitiveness upon this subject.&#xD;

&#xD;
It does now occur to me, however, that you were&#xD;
charged with professing friendship, in one part of&#xD;
your District, to temperance; while in another,&#xD;
you were a rabid anti-temperance man."&#xD;
"You are, doubtless, unable to see many things&#xD;
now that you do not need votes, that yOu could&#xD;
have clearly discerned before the election. The&#xD;
man in whose composition demagogisni is not a&#xD;
proinii~ ent ingredient, is ide ntic ally the s a inc ma ii&#xD;
after, that he was before his election."&#xD;
"That rule Mr. Leblond, would make demagogues&#xD;
of a vast majority of those who have been before&#xD;
the public, ai~d probably include your Honor an(l&#xD;
myself. But there is so much of human nature in&#xD;
being a little more affal)le, a little more disposed&#xD;
to please, and a little less inclined to take um-&#xD;
brage before, than after the contest. A man ought&#xD;
not to be charged with dissimulation and dema-&#xD;
gogism unless there is a clear and marked de-&#xD;
parture from integrity, and fair, manly conduct.&#xD;
But, a truce to your restless thQughts; I am glad&#xD;
you have beaten Barber, and hope' you will dis-&#xD;
tinguish yourself among the Solons at the Capitol.&#xD;
Let us drink. This rum is a new drink to me. Is&#xD;

"I have not tried it, Judge," said Leblond. It&#xD;
will take but a short time to test its qualities."&#xD;
"Jew ett," said Jones, after partaking very bouiv&#xD;
tifully of the new drink, "that rum is a superb ar-&#xD;
ticle. Try a little of it. The election is now over,&#xD;
&#xD;
and we are elected all round; therefore, we can&#xD;
eat, (Irilik, and be merry" -&#xD;
" For 'to-morrow we die !' " exclaimed Jewett.&#xD;
"I hope not," replied Jones. " So sudden an&#xD;
exit as that would lcave me deeply in your debt&#xD;
~ p~ favors, all of which I trust I shall live long&#xD;
enough to cancel."&#xD;
Get inc out of this confounded dilemma with&#xD;
Tom IJarris, and you will expunge them all with&#xD;
one fell swoop," said Jewett.&#xD;
~,rrl~at is a facts" said Jones ; that thing nmst be&#xD;
attended to })roIflptly. I hope, Mr. Jewett, you&#xD;
will borrow no trouble from that source.&#xD;
"1 seldom borrow trouble, Judge," replied Jew-&#xD;
efl. "The real ills of life are sufficiently afflictive,&#xD;
without drawing upon our imaginations for ideal&#xD;
()IW 5."&#xD;
That is ti~ue," sai(l Jones, as a thoug'htfnl shade&#xD;
stoic over his countenance ; and added: "how&#xD;
many, oh ! how vei~y many of the actual evils of&#xD;
life do we invite, and even woo '~ "&#xD;
Ay, and win," quickly aided Jewett.&#xD;
As true as the book of Cenisis," said Jones.&#xD;
If I had been true to the impulses of my better&#xD;
nature, this Tom Harris difficulty would never&#xD;
have occurred."&#xD;
"If I had been true to my professions, Judge,"&#xD;
said Jewett, "ii could not have happened."&#xD;
"The difference, then, between us, is this: that&#xD;
while you refused to obey good impulses, which&#xD;

The question now~ Judge,-and you know we&#xD;

greater transgressor, you or I; but how shall I get&#xD;
freed from this difficulty? harris is a malicious&#xD;

More fell than the tigers of the Lybian Plane.',,&#xD;
"My dear fellow give yourself no further unea-&#xD;
siness about this matter, I will attend to it," sai(i&#xD;
Jones.&#xD;
" ' The wages of sin is death,' " said Leblond,&#xD;
who had been attentively regarding Jewett and&#xD;
Judge Jones.&#xD;
"Jewett fancied he saw no little acrimony in&#xD;
Leblond's manner, immediately replied:&#xD;
"Tell me, what shall thy wages be ?" And ad..&#xD;
ded, "we can quote Scripture, too, Mr. Leblond."&#xD;
Jones, seeing the turn it was likely to take-Le-.&#xD;
blond being impetuous-and feeling desirous to&#xD;
change the subject again, reinin~kd J~wett that he&#xD;
had not partaken of the rum.&#xD;
Jewett took up the bottle, and after looking at&#xD;
it a moment, repeated from Milton:&#xD;
"Of man's first disobedience and the fruit&#xD;
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste,&#xD;
Brought death into the world; and all our woe."&#xD;
"When you are among wolves you must howl,"&#xD;
said Leblond,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Most certainly," replied Jewett, and quaffed&#xD;
his glass.&#xD;
Judge Jones rose, and stepped forward to .the&#xD;
table, took a glass, and said, "Come gentlemen,&#xD;
come; let us forget our troubles. They are un-&#xD;
bidden guests at this time. Come, Jewett, partake&#xD;
of a little more of this nectar, this drink of the gods,&#xD;
and dream of diadems, and 'ribbons red and blue."&#xD;
" A diadem of beauty?"&#xD;
rather quisically enquired Leblond.&#xD;
"The election is now over," said Jo~ies; "and&#xD;
the ladies, I suppose, have entered the heart, or&#xD;
head-and perhaps both-of Mr. Leblond, and de-&#xD;
throned politics ; and you must not be astonished&#xD;
if you find him, for the next six months, practicing&#xD;
in Cupid's court."&#xD;
"Come, gentlemen; don't be backward. Come&#xD;
all, and drink."&#xD;
All, ace ordin~l~?, having gathered around the ta-&#xD;
ble, and drank first of one description of the "nec-&#xD;

to judge of the merits of each.&#xD;
"Now," said Judge Jones, "about this Harris&#xD;
matter. XYh4 shall we do? The bond for Jew.&#xD;
ett's appearance at Court, is only one hundred dol-&#xD;

"No, Judge," said Leblond; "that will never&#xD;
do. It will come up in judgement against yon, on&#xD;
some future occasion, when you would give all&#xD;
you possess, and ten times that amount, for the&#xD;
power to recall it."&#xD;
Well," sai(l Jones, "what then ?&#xD;
"Procure some man to go and see IJarris,'~ said&#xD;
Leblond. I would, at all times, and under all cii'-&#xD;
cunmtanees, prefer walking fifty miles, on foot and&#xD;
after night at that, to have an interview with a pol-&#xD;
itician, than to write him a letter. When it he~-&#xD;
comes necessary, you can deny any charge brought&#xD;
against you, growing out of the interview ; while&#xD;
if the charge is 'in black and white, you will occa-&#xD;
sionally find it difficult to manage."&#xD;
"That idea," said Jones, "did not strike me~&#xD;
It would hok rather bad upon paper."&#xD;
"Politicians must have Argus eyes," said Le-&#xD;
blod. " And," continued he, " I would send some&#xD;
sharp fellow to see him, with a proposition of this&#xD;
character, that in case he would not appear and&#xD;
prosecute Jewett, he should have twenty-five, or&#xD;
even fifty dollars; and be sure to clothe your rr~inis-&#xD;
ter plenipotentiary with discretionary ~ er, o he&#xD;
can rise and fall-go and come'-to suit the exi-&#xD;
gencies of the occasion. Every man has his price.&#xD;
we are told upon high ~.uthority. it may be that&#xD;
his price is twenty-five dollars, and hence the ne-&#xD;
~essity of a discretionary power. Lie must be told&#xD;
that the bond is only one hundred,~ and that if&#xD;
&#xD;
Jevvett apprehend any danger, he will not appear,&#xD;
but forfeit his bond; in which event, Harris (being&#xD;
a lawyer), will know the amount of the bond will&#xD;
go into the public treasury and nothing into the&#xD;
pockets of' Mr. lilarris. He is a mercenary crea-&#xD;
tare; and with a littl.~ diplomacy, may be reached."&#xD;
Judge Alban remarked, that there was an easier&#xD;
and ~afcr way of disposing of the trouble than&#xD;
had yet been suggested.&#xD;
"116w?" immediately interrupted Jones.&#xD;
"Just leave the matter to me," said Alban.&#xD;
Certainly," said Jones ; "this cursed thing did&#xD;
take place in Alban's Judicial Circuit. Why did&#xD;
not xve think of that before ?&#xD;
"I can fix it all up," said Alban. "I can charge&#xD;
the Grand Jury they arc not bound to notice in~-&#xD;
fractions of the law growing out of excitement con-&#xD;
sequent upon the election; but, on the contrary.&#xD;
wholly to disregard them-that the public good de-&#xD;
mands the sacrifice."&#xD;
(doing upon the supposition," said Jones," that&#xD;
the Grand Jury should disregard your charge, and&#xD;
find a bill; what then?"&#xD;
"I will then advise the Public Prosecutor to&#xD;
node the indictment."&#xD;

"Jn my Court, sit," said Alban, an advi&amp;amp; is as&#xD;
imperative as an order, and must be obeyed what-&#xD;
ever the eonseqUeflCes may be."&#xD;
"Where, Judge Alban, do you get your author-&#xD;

ecutor? Ii think you can find nothing in the stat-&#xD;
ute, in the common law, or in thc practice of in.&#xD;
telling cut Courts to justify such a practice."&#xD;
"What difference does that make ?" said Albang&#xD;
The prosecuting Attorney has no remedy. lie&#xD;
has no right to a bill of exception, a writ of error,&#xD;
nor an appeal. I kick it out of court, and that i~&#xD;
the last of it. I dislike that d ~i Prosecutor up&#xD;

But you have a reputation to look after," said&#xD;
Jones, " and that is dearer to every jurist than afl.&#xD;

Well, well," said Alban, " we arc told by a&#xD;
great state5fl1~i~, that 'in revolutioI~ai~y times we&#xD;

man adapts his measures to his exigencies."&#xD;
"If you will take the responsibility," replied&#xD;
Jones, '~ it is the safe~st and most criedtablc plan&#xD;
for Jewett, as the impressloll will then go abroad&#xD;
that there were no merits in the case, and hence&#xD;
no indictment was found ; or, if found, that the&#xD;
Court regarded it as vexatious and without merit."&#xD;
" Cpurt sits up there, next week, and," contin-&#xD;

recognizance; and I will take care of the balance."&#xD;

That will do!" said Leblond. " I like to hear&#xD;

"My (lear fellow, said Alban, " a man who is&#xD;

Jewett's eyes flashed, and he was about to re-&#xD;

ones, discovering what might be the result, inter..&#xD;

him up to the table, poured out a quantity of brandy&#xD;
into two glasses, one of which he handed to Jewett,&#xD;

"It is now late," said Leblonci, " and it seems to&#xD;
me something lass 'than a month since we have&#xD;
~eaten any thing. 'Boy, bring us up twenty dishes of&#xD;
oysters !"&#xD;
The boy re piied that the' servants had all retired&#xD;
several hours since, and that oysters, at that late&#xD;
hour, or rather at so early an hour, (it being about&#xD;
two in the morning,) could not be cooked in that&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Alban hiccoughed, "this is a d-d pretty tavern,&#xD;

after the In p~c of more than an hour, our xvorthy&#xD;
Ji~dges, C on re:~men, and Politicians, were not in&#xD;

is ~artin. I have been up all night; and now, they&#xD;
wont be ate. Well, that is not my business; ~&#xD;

"Lord 'a massy !" said the boy; as he passed&#xD;
down stairs, "Jack Blacl~ and Ned Brown, don't&#xD;

Here, Harris picked up his chair and placed it&#xD;
down by the side of the public Prosecutor, who&#xD;
had been taken by surprise with the charge of the&#xD;
court.&#xD;
"Why," said Harris, Lord Jeffi'ies' was a saint)&#xD;
when compared with Alban ! Mr. Prosecutor, did.&#xD;
you ever witnes~such a scene? Who, even in the&#xD;
darkest days of JFudicial tyranny, ever heard such&#xD;
language fall from the lips of a J udge ?"&#xD;
"I was anticipating it," said the h'oseeutor.-&#xD;
" He is a most c6rrupt man, and has di~graccc1 the&#xD;
'bench every time he has sat upon it. I~assion and&#xD;
prejudice rule the man."&#xD;
I should think he had soiled the ermine."&#xD;
"Ermine," said the Prosecutor. " He scarcely&#xD;
knows what it means. I will bring liiii to his fe.eb&#xD;

"Take good care, said harris "that he does&#xD;
not bring you to your feelings." You must re-&#xD;
member that he has the power all in his own hands~&#xD;

"I can expose hint;" said the Pr~secutor, "be-&#xD;

"lie has the advantage of you; and, if you in-&#xD;

a~ man in danger from this vice. While strong&#xD;
heads may save men from the commission of crime,&#xD;
virtuous hearts can alone save them from contract-&#xD;
ing vicious habits. The universal experiencee of&#xD;
ages will attest the fact."&#xD;
Leblond, unable to reply, and feeling his situa-&#xD;
tion was becoming more and more uncomfortable,&#xD;
made another effort to change t1~ e subject, by in-&#xD;
sisting that Sibley would very soon be drinking&#xD;
again.&#xD;
Lie will sot," said Barber.&#xD;
lIe will ," replied Lel)lond.&#xD;
He will not," repeated Barber.&#xD;
He will," continued Leblond.&#xD;
You are entirely mistaken in the man," said&#xD;
Barbei'. "lie has too much firmness of purpose."&#xD;
"Perhaps you would risk a little money upon&#xD;
your opinion of Sibley's firmness of purpose ?"&#xD;
No, sir !" said Barber. " A wager is a fool's&#xD;
last argument."&#xD;
" Yes, sir ! and fools often lose at the game,"&#xD;
retorted Leblond. "I am always icady to back&#xD;
up my opinions with money."&#xD;
"I, upon the contrary, usually back mine with&#xD;
argument of a different character," said Barber.&#xD;
"You dare not bet," said Leblond.&#xD;
"I dare do anything that an honest man cando&#xD;
with a clear conscience," said Barber.&#xD;
&#xD;
223&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'll bet you one hundred dollars," continued&#xD;
Leblond, "that Sibley is drinking again in less&#xD;
time than one month. Now, cover it, if you are a&#xD;
man ; and, if not, be a little more modest, and&#xD;
make less parade of your opinions."&#xD;
In violation of principle, and my convictions&#xD;
of right, Eli cover your money," said Barber.&#xD;
\Yl~ere shall we make the deposit? " inquired&#xD;
Lebiond.&#xD;
Any where," replied Barber. "With lAir. Ames,&#xD;
across the street, Ii suppose.&#xD;
They walked over the way, and deposited with&#xD;
Mr. Ain(s, each, 0110 hundred dollars, in pursuance&#xD;

that lie had compromised his character, his prin-&#xD;
ciples, and his dignity-felt that he had disgraced&#xD;
himself, and had been guilty of gross folly.&#xD;
Now," soliloquized Leblond, " we'll see who is&#xD;
ihe fool. Eli bleed the sage gentleman, to the tune&#xD;
of one hundred, certain."&#xD;
Barber walked directly to Sibiey's office, and in-&#xD;
lormedi him of what was done. And urged him,&#xD;
by all he valued in life-by his hopes in the future&#xD;
~VOrld, to abstain.&#xD;
Sibley was aficeted oven to tears, and replied:&#xD;
Barber, I have every thing to gain, and noth-&#xD;
ii~g to lose, in clinging to principle; while I have&#xD;

Leblond, after an absence of a few hours, re-&#xD;
turned to his office, ill at ease. lie had accom-&#xD;
pushed his purpose, in part, but the more he re-&#xD;
volved the matter~ in his mind, the less he felt in-&#xD;
clined to draw ~ibIey into the whirlpool from which&#xD;
he had so recently escaped.&#xD;
Finally, he was heard to say "What am I to&#xD;
do; let old Barber have my money? No, that&#xD;
will not do. I have earned it 'in the sweat of my&#xD;
face,' and he shall not appropriate it to his "own&#xD;
benefit and. behoof," that is as certain as 1 live!&#xD;
What then? Qo to Barber and tell him this bet-&#xD;
ting is all foolish, and that I would prefer losing'&#xD;
the money, to seeing Siblcy drink again; and pro-&#xD;
pose drawing the bet?" After a moment's re-&#xD;
flection, he continued "1 don't like that idea; it&#xD;
would be humiliating. I dogged him into this bet,&#xD;
and now, to back out of it would l)c yielding more&#xD;
than I ought. I won't do it."&#xD;
lie sat, wrapt in thought, for a considerable&#xD;
time, ~yhiie fierce passions were at war in his bo-&#xD;
som. " A capital idea! That is it ! I can tell&#xD;
Sibley that I have made the bet, and have hint&#xD;
take a dram---and but a dram-by which I cai~&#xD;
win the money; and that, by way of considera-&#xD;
tion, I will give him one half of the prize I shall&#xD;
bear off. But, how am I to approach Sibley? And&#xD;
then"suppose, after he takes one dram, he should&#xD;
insist upon another and another, and relapse into&#xD;
hi~ old habits? That would be horrible!. horrible !!,&#xD;
&#xD;
it was only last Sabbath I saw 'him genteel dress~&#xD;
ed, with his wife and family, all neatly and taste-&#xD;
fully attired, on their way to Church. Incur the&#xD;
risk of breaking up this felicity-this beatic joy ?"&#xD;
He sprang to his feet, and exclaimed: "No, by&#xD;
hell! I can't!" And began, in a deep state of agi-&#xD;
tation, to walk back and forward, across the floor&#xD;
of his office.&#xD;
1-Je calmed down and muttered, "d-n it, our&#xD;
first thoughts are always the best. I will go to&#xD;
sibley; he is not a fool; and, for fifty dollars, he&#xD;
can take one glass and then quit. But it will not&#xD;
do for me to go with him.&#xD;
"We must draw in somebody that may stand&#xD;
'Twixt us and danger."&#xD;
That is, however, easily got along with. I can&#xD;
see Jake Infamy, the grocery keeper, and send&#xD;
Sibley to him, with the understanding that 'he is&#xD;
to have one glass, and one only. But, I will dream&#xD;
over this thing, and to-morrow, if I am of the&#xD;

fore he passed by here~ This confounded affair&#xD;
has annoyed me more than any little incident in&#xD;
the whole course of my life; and then, it may&#xD;
prove more than a little incident.&#xD;
Leblond rose, next morning, feverish and still&#xD;
debating with himself whether he ought not to go&#xD;
to Barber-frankly acknowledge his er~or.-and&#xD;
draw the bet. And thus he continued 'suspended&#xD;

&#xD;
between duty and avarice, until near the close of&#xD;
the month, having, in the meantime, been drinking&#xD;
freely. On the morning of the last day of the&#xD;
time ~peeifled, Leblond dropped into a grocery and&#xD;
took, in the course of two hours, three or four&#xD;
heavy potations, and then repaired to Sibley's of-&#xD;
fice, remarking to Infamy as he left, that he would&#xD;
I      ''try him on, at all events."&#xD;
"The wager, ~s related to Sibley, by Barber,&#xD;
had entirely passed from his memory; and, con-.&#xD;
sequently, when Leblond entered his office, the&#xD;
object of his visit did not occur to Sibley.&#xD;
Mr. Sibley," remarked Leblond, "I have a fa-&#xD;
vour to ask of you, this morning. It is of a very&#xD;
delicate character, yet I have no doubt you ~vi14&#xD;
confer it."&#xD;
"1 am under many obligations to you, Mr. Le-&#xD;
blond. Name your desire, and if it is within the&#xD;
range of possibilities, it shall be gratified."&#xD;
Leblond hesitated, but finally gave Sibley to un-&#xD;
derstand that he wanted him to drink a glass of&#xD;
brandy at the grocery.&#xD;
"Sir," exclaimed Sibley, you have drawn a draft&#xD;
upon    that I must dishonor."&#xD;
"Leblond was so much under the influence of&#xD;
liquor that he was void of the little sensibility he&#xD;
usually possessed; and, therefore, went on to enu~&#xD;
merate the very mauy favors he had bestowed&#xD;
upon Sibley and his family, and wound up by al-&#xD;
luding to the fact, that Barber was not and nevcr&#xD;
&#xD;
had been his. friend, and that while he had stepped'&#xD;
forward and defended him upon his trial, Barber&#xD;
allowed himself to be used against him upon the&#xD;
part of the State.&#xD;
Sibley remembered the manner of Barber's at-&#xD;
tack upon him, and while it ought to have roused&#xD;
his pride and strengthened his resolution, by re-&#xD;
minding him of his degi'adation, it fired his re-&#xD;
venge and inclined him to favor LebIond~s propo~&#xD;

"I acknowledged that I owe you a debt of grati-&#xD;

remarked Sibley.--" That you have claims upon&#xD;
my gratitude and regard, no other man ever has&#xD;
had, or can have; and," continued he, "it is with&#xD;
the deepest regret that I now refuse to comply with&#xD;
your present request. YOLI could make no requi-&#xD;

involve my shame, my degradation, my complete&#xD;

would rather borrow teii times the amount of the&#xD;
bet and give it to you. I would rather, at this mo-&#xD;

grant your request."&#xD;
"Can't you," said Leblond, "take one dram and&#xD;
then stop?"&#xD;
"That is exceedingly doubtful, sir;" said Sib-&#xD;

rob me of the confidence of my patrons and friends,&#xD;
and be the death knell of all my hopes in life."&#xD;
Leblond, with all the archness of a fiend, as~&#xD;
sumed a tone of voice in unison with Sibley's&#xD;
lacerated feelings, and remarked that the wager&#xD;
was a most unfortunate incident, and that if fifty&#xD;
times the amount involved, would recall the fol-&#xD;
lies of that hour, he would willingly give it; but&#xD;
it was more than a mere matter of dollars and&#xD;
cents-it involved his wounded pride and disgrace.&#xD;
But," returned Sibley, "it involves my wounded&#xD;
pride, my disgrace. It goes beyond that-it in-&#xD;
volves my ruin-and that of my family-in time,&#xD;
and, may be, in eternity."&#xD;
"Come, Sibley, come; let 's take a stroll and dis-&#xD;
pel this~melancholy that's mantling your count&amp;amp;&#xD;
nance."&#xD;
They walked down street, and as they passed&#xD;
along, Leblond suggested an ice lemonade.&#xD;
$ibley opposed going into a saloon.&#xD;
Leblond insisted the~ drink proposed, was quite&#xD;
as harmless as coffee.&#xD;
They entered a saloon, and Leblond called for&#xD;
~the ade which was immediately prepared and&#xD;
placed v~pon the counter. After drinking about&#xD;
one fourth of the contents of his glass, Leblond&#xD;
~ear~fiilly raised a decanter, and while Sibley's atten-&#xD;
4~ion was in another direction, poured a small quan-&#xD;
tity of iirandy into his glass. Without having no-&#xD;
ticed what had occurred, Sibley quaffed his glass,&#xD;
&#xD;
and instantly turned upon Leblond and exclaimed:&#xD;
"You emptied brandy in my glass, sir!"&#xD;
Leblond drew down his brows, and cautiously&#xD;
began a reply, without knowing precisely what&#xD;
shape to give it-whether to deny the charge or&#xD;
attempt a mitigation of his baseness.&#xD;
While Leblond was stammering aI~d taxing his&#xD;
mental energies for an answer, Sibley seized the&#xD;
bottle and filled his glass to the brim with brandy,&#xD;
and impelled by an insatiate appetite, roused by&#xD;
Leblond~s imposition, drank it to the bottom, and&#xD;
immediately left the saloon.&#xD;
Leblond, stupefied as well a~ alarmed at the re-&#xD;
sult of his villainy, in sullen silence followed Sib-&#xD;
1ev, at a distance, until he saw him enter a grocery.&#xD;
lie quickened his pace, and was at his side in time&#xD;
to seize his arm, as lie was in the act of raising&#xD;
a glass of liquor to his lips, exclaiming, almost at&#xD;
the top of his voice, "In heaven's name, Sibley,&#xD;
what are ~ doing?"&#xD;
Sibley turned upon him, and cried out, "In hells&#xD;
name, what have you done, sir?"&#xD;
Contrary to Leblond's remonstrance, and in spite&#xD;
of all his efforts, Sibley drank his glass-reeled&#xD;
out and staggered up the street-entered his office&#xD;
a moment, and then proceeded to his house. As&#xD;
he crossed the threshold of his door he fell. Mrs.&#xD;
Sibley rose, and as she raised up both hands, ex-&#xD;
claimed, "Oh! Sibley, Sibley! De~olation has&#xD;
again entered our humble abode!"&#xD;

"There are many things to be considered,'~ said&#xD;

The marriage relation is, of all others, the&#xD;
most sacred; and, unless it is based upon pure, as&#xD;
well as reciprocal affection, there is great dan-&#xD;
ger of discord, and the thousand other troubles that&#xD;
break up and ruin families. I would rather fob&#xD;
low Ameliato he: grave than witness her mercenary&#xD;
marriage1" "As to his success in business," con-&#xD;
tinued she, "how often do we see the most disso-&#xD;
lute, for a time, ' flourish like a- green bay tree?'&#xD;
And in politics, generally, the greater the scamp,&#xD;
and the more unprincipled the man, the more cer-&#xD;
tain is success. With a plentiful supply of villainy,&#xD;
and a moderate portion of cunning it requires but&#xD;
little intellect to secure temporary political success.'&#xD;
"Is Amelia engaged ?" enquired her father.&#xD;
Not that I. know of," replied the mother.&#xD;
Well," continued he, "why talk about afl'ec-&#xD;
tions in another direction? '~&#xD;
Because," replied she, " this tampering with&#xD;
the affections-this match-making, and match-&#xD;
breaking, is a very delicate business; and hence,&#xD;
I instituted the inquiry. It is seldom that attach-&#xD;
ments formed late in life, have anything like .per-&#xD;
manency about them; and why? Because the en-&#xD;
tire i~ egion of the heart has been occupied and re-&#xD;
occupied, until it has become sterile, unproductive,&#xD;
and incapable of producing anything licyofid the&#xD;
respect or regard an individual would have for one&#xD;
of his or her own sex. And hence, late marriages&#xD;
are always to be avoided, unless there is sufficient&#xD;
&#xD;
sterling good sense, on both sides, to keep in check&#xD;
the less amiable qualities of our nature."&#xD;
Here, he interrupted, by reminding he~r that&#xD;
she was always moralizing and philosophizing on&#xD;
every thing, li oxvever trivial.&#xD;
She answered him, by hoping that he did not&#xD;
consider the temporal, and possibly the eternal,&#xD;

large rocking' -chair, near by.&#xD;
After the confusion of the meeting' was over,&#xD;
Amelia said-&#xD;
It has been a long time since we have had&#xD;
the 1leasuire of seeing you in this part of the&#xD;
country; " and added, "it has been as much a~&#xD;
eight years since I saw you."&#xD;
"I have seen you, very frequently, since that ;"&#xD;
replied Leblond.&#xD;
"When an] where ?" exclaimed Amelia, with&#xD;
some surprise.&#xD;
"In visions of the night," answered Leblond.&#xD;
Amelia blushed, and was silent.&#xD;
Our lovers felt deeply embarrassed. The thoughts&#xD;
of other days were upon them. The reminiscences&#xD;
&#xD;
of childhood and early youth were crowding upoi~&#xD;
their minds, and it stopped their utterance The&#xD;
silence was at length broken by Amelia, who&#xD;
thought Mr. Leblond had grown considerable since&#xD;
8he had last seen him.&#xD;
Leblond replied, that when he left, his height&#xD;
was five }~et ten, and that it was now six feet and&#xD;
two; and added that Miss Amelia had changed&#xD;
quite as much as he had.&#xD;
"Mr. Leblond," said Amelia, " You must have&#xD;
enjoyed excellent health; at least you have that&#xD;
appearance."&#xD;
"Very good," replied Leblond. "I have labored&#xD;
very hard, and studied some; and yet my appear-&#xD;
ance wouId~ probably, not indicate that I had done&#xD;
much at either."&#xD;
" You haxre had some out-door exercise, I hope ?"&#xD;
remarked Amelia.&#xD;
aid Leblond. "I have confined&#xD;
myself to my office but very little for the last few&#xD;
months. I have been engaged in what we polite~&#xD;
clans call ' campaigning.'"&#xD;
You made it pay, I have had the pleasure to be&#xD;
informed;" blushing slightly as she recollected the&#xD;
source and Occasion of the information.&#xD;
That remains behind the curtain of the future,"&#xD;
said Leblond. "There is little advantage to be&#xD;
derived from entering the arena and turning polit-&#xD;
ical gladiator. There is alxvays some wear and&#xD;
tear of conscience."&#xD;

"I hope," exclaimed Amelia, "you came out of&#xD;
the struggle unscathed?" Discovering that she&#xD;
threw a little too much feeling into the inquiry,&#xD;
she colored ~lightly, and was again silent.&#xD;
Leblorid, feeling that he could not answer in the&#xD;
affirmative without a misrepresentation, bow ed,&#xD;
and proceeded to say, that so numerous were the&#xD;
political aspirants, at the present day, that it was a&#xD;
constant process of pulling down and climbing up.&#xD;
That as soon as a man acquired some position,&#xD;
there were so many interested in pulling him&#xD;
down and pushing him out of the way, that unless&#xD;
he was a man of much more than ordinary caliber,&#xD;
his political course was a brief one; and when he&#xD;
was forced from the arena, he was generally in a&#xD;
crippled conditioTh and usually disqualified for&#xD;
grappling With any other pursuit in life."&#xD;
"Forbear, you things&#xD;
That stand upon the pinnacles of state,&#xD;
To boast your slippery height; when you do fall&#xD;
You dash yourselves in pieces, never to rise."&#xD;
is the sentiment of Ben Jolmson," said Amelia, and&#xD;
then expressed the hope that he would get out&#xD;
without being pushed out and dashed in pieces.&#xD;
Leblond replied that there was an ucca~ional&#xD;
instance, such as she had suggested, but they were&#xD;
"Like angels visits, few and far between."&#xD;
Men," continued he, love "power-love excite-&#xD;

Leblond, having remained longer than fashion&#xD;
or policy would sanction, rose to leave, when Arne-&#xD;
ha expressed the hope they would have the pleas-&#xD;
ure of his society again, during the evening.&#xD;
Leblond bowed assent, bade her good afternoon,&#xD;
After he reached his room, he threw himself upon&#xD;
and soliloquized as follows:&#xD;
the ' Spectator,' which is good British au~&#xD;
thority, at least, tells us "lovers are always allowed&#xD;
the comfort of soliloquy.' Things are right if I&#xD;
have not misinterpreted the signs of the times.&#xD;
So far as the old gentlenmu is concerned, he is now&#xD;

ed intellect. What a sensation a woman of her&#xD;
appearance and versatile acquirements would pro-&#xD;
duce at the National Capitol. Well, we shall see,&#xD;
in the course of a very few days, in what all these&#xD;
things ~vill result. She is the only woman that&#xD;
has ever awakened in my bosom the tender passiofi.&#xD;
I came very near acknowledging it, too, when IL&#xD;
told her I had frequently seen her in visions of the&#xD;
night. That was making a declaration rather too&#xD;
soon; but she has not forgotten olden times. They&#xD;
seem to steal over the chords of her memory, like&#xD;
the mild, ethereal tones of the A~olian harp, or&#xD;
strains of distant melody."&#xD;
Here the idea flitted across his mental vision,&#xD;
that it was singular a lady of such rare accomplish-&#xD;
ments, to say nothing of the solid wQrth and shining&#xD;
charms in the shape of one hundred thousand dol-&#xD;
lars in stocks, and those not 'fancy,' should no4t&#xD;
have suitors and. he exclaimed, "if she has been&#xD;

"What need a man forestall his date of grief,&#xD;
And run to meet what he would most avoid ~&#xD;
if they be but false alarms of fear,&#xD;
lIow bitter is such self-delusion 2"&#xD;
After some time spent in silent thought, he rose&#xD;
and gave every possible attention to his toilet that&#xD;
the most exquisite taste could require, and then&#xD;
started for the house of Amelia, wher&amp;amp; all his&#xD;
\hopes now centered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Though he reached his intended father-in-law's,&#xD;
early, he found the house crowded. The rumor&#xD;
had gotten afloat, either through surmise, or some&#xD;
casual remark of the old gentleman, that the sup-&#xD;
pur was given in honor of the future son in-law;&#xD;
every person, son and maiden, grey-haired father&#xD;
and mother, beau and exquisite, honored with ~v&#xD;
bid, was present; and at an unusually early hour.&#xD;
When Leblond entered, he was astonished at the&#xD;
sensation he produced. Tie found himself the&#xD;
observed of all observers." Tie unostentatiousjy&#xD;
took a scat, and engaged in conversation with a&#xD;
gentleman who happened to be in his neighbor-&#xD;
hood.&#xD;
After the abatement of the sensation produced&#xD;
by the appearance of Leblond, who was tall and&#xD;
finely proportioned, the evening, passed off with-&#xD;
oi~t any occurrence to distinguish it from an ordi-&#xD;
nary occasion of the kind; and Lebknd returned&#xD;
to the hotel-retired to rest; and again saw Ame-&#xD;
lia in the vision of his pillow; but more beautiful&#xD;
than~ ever. Seven o'clock, the next morning, found&#xD;
Leblond in Amelia's parlor, listlessly turning over&#xD;
the pages of some choice books upon her pier~&#xD;
table, awaiting her arrival.&#xD;
Amelia soon made her appearance. Leblonci&#xD;
rose, and greeted her with a cordial shake of the,&#xD;
hand. Their attachment h~d commenced in th~&#xD;

life, and had ripened into devotion; but had been&#xD;
buried in the silent chambers of the heart, xvith-&#xD;
out either being conscious that the other possessed&#xD;
it. An ~~knowledgemCnt would have, doubtless,&#xD;
been made of its existence upon the part of Le~&#xD;
blond, and reciprocated by Amelia, had it not&#xD;
been for the opposition of the father. lie had&#xD;
carried it so far as to positively interdict any asso-&#xD;
ciation. The extent of his unkindness, Leblond&#xD;
had never known until he, that day, learned it&#xD;
from Amelia. lie had suspected its existence from&#xD;
her reserve and affected indifference for him,&#xD;
which he had the shrewdness to perceive was&#xD;
affectation. Stung by the repulse, he entered&#xD;
college and nearly became a martyr to his books.&#xD;
lie entered upon the study of the law with the&#xD;
same high and holy purpose of making himself&#xD;
worthy of Amelia. lie seldom entered upon any&#xD;
enterprise without having her present in his mind.&#xD;
her mellow and flute-like voice was constantly&#xD;
ringing in his eat's; and when he engaged in the&#xD;
trial of an important cause, he imagined her by&#xD;
his 5ide, listening to each word as it fell from his&#xD;
lips. Reader, imagine his felicity, when he was&#xD;
informed by liet', that he had never ceased to oc~&#xD;
cupy the big armed chair in her affections.&#xD;
The unkind remark, that he was" a poor unlet-&#xD;
tered boy," was the legitimate fruit of affection&#xD;
provoked by little flirtations carried on by Leblond,&#xD;
among her cotempbraries of the village.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dinner was now announced; when, Leblond&#xD;
said, "You dine early."&#xD;
Amelia replied that the servants, from some&#xD;
cause, had anticipated the usual time; that they&#xD;
diped at twelve.&#xD;
Leblo~d took out his watch, which m;ade it after&#xD;
two.&#xD;
They immediately proceeded to the dining room,&#xD;
where they found the old gentleman, apparently&#xD;
much pleased with himself and the rest of man~&#xD;
kind; while the old lady was in a more thought..&#xD;
ful mood.&#xD;
Leblond rose from the table with the intention&#xD;
of procuring a conveyance, and visiting his parents,&#xD;
who then resided some two or three miles from the&#xD;
village. Before leaving he must see Miss Amelia&#xD;
a moment alone. lIe accordingly entered the&#xD;
parlor; soon after which, Amelia was seated by&#xD;
his side; where they remained, unconscious of the&#xD;
lapse of time, until they were summoned to tea.&#xD;
They had lighted their faith-were affianced.&#xD;
Amelia pressed him to remain for tea, but he tore&#xD;
himself away, and was soon in the humble abode&#xD;
of his parents, where he was the recipient of the&#xD;
hospitalities of their frugal board.&#xD;
After rusticating for several days, and fui'nish.-&#xD;
ing his father the means of purchasing him a&#xD;
small but comfortable home, he returned to the&#xD;
village and spent some two days in the society of&#xD;
Amelia; realizing the beauty of Tupper, as he&#xD;

it often.&#xD;

A mighty spiritual force, warring with the dullness of matter;&#xD;
Au Angel-mind, breathed into a mortal, though fallen, yet how&#xD;
beautiful I&#xD;
All the devotion of the heart in all its d~pth and grandeur."&#xD;
All was now done but the most difficult part.-&#xD;
To submit the negotiation for the ratification of&#xD;
her parents, was neither a business matter nor a&#xD;
legitimate part of the practice in court of the lit-&#xD;
tie god Cupid. The more he revolved the thing in&#xD;
his mind, the more difficult it became. Amelia&#xD;
had left the parlor some thirty minutes, and it&#xD;
seemed to him an age. lie' finally rose, and bid-&#xD;
ding Mr~ Leonard good night, walked some&#xD;
tanee north of the village, and was soon in the&#xD;
midst of a delightful grove of sugar maple. In&#xD;
that sequestered spot he sat upon a moss covered&#xD;
mound-thrown up by a tree that had probably&#xD;
been torn out by the rude storm, but had long&#xD;
since mouldered to its former elements-viewing&#xD;
the varied hues of a distant forest as the mellowed&#xD;
rays of an autumnal sun, retiring beyond the west~-&#xD;
em hills, lingered upon its foliage-while he re-&#xD;
peated from Tupper the following exquisite lines:&#xD;
"There is a fragrant blossom, that maketh glad the garden of the head;&#xD;
Its root lieth deep; it is delicate, yet lasting, as the lilac crocus o~&#xD;
autuluhl!&#xD;
Loneliness and thought are the dews that water it morn and even ~&#xD;
Nlleiuory and Absence cheri.Th it, as the balmy breathiuge of the soutk&amp;amp;:&#xD;
&#xD;
Ws sun' is the brightness of affection, and it bloozneth in the borders&#xD;
of hope;&#xD;
It~ companions are the gentle flowers, and the brier withereth by its&#xD;
side.&#xD;
I saw it budding in beauty; I felt the magic of its smile."&#xD;
Leblond felt as he had never before. His sym-&#xD;
pathies were all upon the si(le of virtue, lie sat&#xD;
forming resolutions and plans for future life, until&#xD;
the dews of evening began to distil around him,&#xD;
and the shades of night settle upon the beautiful&#xD;
landscape spread out before him.&#xD;
Among the resolutions he had formed was that&#xD;
he would never again drink anything that would&#xD;
intoxicate. And, for the purpose of freeing him-&#xD;
self from the temptation that would beset hiiii&#xD;
upon his return home, he determined to come out&#xD;
an open and av6wcd Thiend and advocate of the&#xD;
Maine law, and embrace all suitable opportuni-&#xD;
ties of publicly discussing the necessity and im-&#xD;
l)o1'tance of its passage.&#xD;
lie returned and spent the evening with Amelia.&#xD;
Before leaving the hotel, he attempted to pen&#xD;
Mr. Leonard a line, and in that way, invite a rati-&#xD;
fication of the treaty, but he invariably came to a&#xD;
halt as soon as he had written, "L. Leonard;&#xD;
Esq., My Dear Sir :" and, after several ineffectual&#xD;
efforts, quitted the unpleasant task, for the more&#xD;
agreeable one of a tete-a-tete with Amelia.&#xD;
In the course of the evening, Mr. Leonard came&#xD;
into the parlor; and, thereupon, Amelia left it.&#xD;
"Now," thought Tdeblond, "is my time; and&#xD;

he stammered it out more awkwardly than he had&#xD;

and sitting a few moments, Mr. Leonard rose up~&#xD;
took his hat and left the room; when, in the course&#xD;
of a few moments, Mrs. Leonard entered the par-&#xD;

whether the'~y had her coiisent. She nodded asse~it&#xD;
~nd sobbed, "Amelia is a good girl ;" and imme-&#xD;
diately left the room.&#xD;
Leblond and Amelia fixed the period for their&#xD;
union, which was to occur as he was passing&#xD;
through, on his way to Congress; and separated&#xD;
as do lovers usually.&#xD;

Tupper.&#xD;
Judge AlbanPiiosecutor Lalim, and Sheriff Sikes,&#xD;
had engaged actively in the political campaign,&#xD;
Previous to which no one of whom had been re-&#xD;
garded as a confirmed inebriateyet each was fond&#xD;
of a glass, and were in the habit of drinking, more&#xD;
or less, every week; and would, occasionally, be-&#xD;
come quite intoxicated.&#xD;
During the political contest, the Sheriff confined&#xD;
hi~ operations to the county in which he resided,&#xD;
travelling from town to town, drinking freely, and&#xD;
as freely treating the friends and sttpporters of Le-&#xD;
blond-It was said-with Leblond's money; but&#xD;
of that we are not certain, and therefore, will not&#xD;
venture the positive assertion.&#xD;
4        The field of Alban and Lahm was more extended.&#xD;
They went from county to county, and from town&#xD;
to town, in each county in the Congressional&#xD;
District; and, as they passed, called, not upon the&#xD;
sober, thinking, and better' portion of the commu-&#xD;
nity, bu~ mingling with that class of our fellow-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7936-00000125"/>&#xD;
citizens who constitute the floating vote in every&#xD;
political contest-charging Barber with being a&#xD;
temperance man, liberal and contracted in all&#xD;
his views; while they claimed for Leblond, that he&#xD;
had' no connection with any of the fanatics of&#xD;
the day-was generous to a fault-liberal in all&#xD;
his notions and views-would drink a dram when&#xD;
he needed it, and always had a few dimes with&#xD;
which to treat his friends.&#xD;
On one occasion, after our two worthies had left,&#xD;
the following conversation took place, between a&#xD;
clergyman and one of his deacons, who had been&#xD;
closely observing Alban and Lahrn in their efforts&#xD;
to make votes for Leblond:&#xD;
~ I have sometimes thought it strange," said the&#xD;
Deacon, "that such characters, should be able to&#xD;
exert any influence on their fellow men."&#xD;
"Men have, in all ages of the world," said the&#xD;
clergyman, "been more easily reached through&#xD;
their vices than their virtues."&#xD;
"That is a dark picture of human nature."&#xD;
"It is nevertheless true. The history, of every&#xD;
age and country establishes the fact."&#xD;
"It is a picture," exclaimed the deacon, "over&#xD;
which the heart sickens. You do not mean, I hope,&#xD;
that all men are more under the influence of vice&#xD;
than virtue?"&#xD;
"No," replied the clergyman. "Heisod said,&#xD;
many centuries ago, that the gods had placed la-&#xD;
bor before virtue. To be virtuous you must strug-&#xD;

gie up stream against wind and current while to&#xD;
he vicious is to throw, or-unresistingly allow your-&#xD;
self to get into the stream and float upon the cur-&#xD;
rent wit hout effort. Hence the injunction, "watch&#xD;
p~ud pray lest ye enter into temptation.'&#xD;
"I have noticed," said the deacon, "that while&#xD;
you, and I, and other sober and industrious men,&#xD;
are pass ~d by these politicians, without being re-&#xD;
garded as possessing any power over our neighbors,&#xD;
worth soliciting; while Torn Snooks, Joe Haynes,&#xD;
and Dick Bumpers, are courted, treated, and con-&#xD;
ferred with. Why is it? They are by no means a&#xD;
inaj ority in. any community."&#xD;
"No," i'ephied the clergyman, "this poor unfor-&#xD;
t~uiiatc class of men you mention, are not more&#xD;
than a tenth of the community, and yet they con-&#xD;
trol the other nine-tenths."&#xD;
"Can you inform me how this thing is brought&#xD;
about?" inquired the deacon.&#xD;
~I ~trn very little of the politician," said the&#xD;
clergyman, "yet I have fancied the thing wa~&#xD;
easy of solution. Such men as Snooks, Haynes,&#xD;
and Bumpers, with a few kindred spirits generally&#xD;
infest every community. They have no charac-&#xD;
ters to lose; and hence they assert anything and&#xD;
everything, without any regard, whatever, to truth.&#xD;

incredible as it may appear, in process of time this&#xD;
class of men will manufacture a public sentiment&#xD;
which carries the election. They exert an influ-&#xD;
ence upon better men than themselves; .and they,&#xD;
in their turn, upon still a better class; and thus,&#xD;
until the entire community is permeated."&#xD;
"That reminds me, of the story of Themostocles&#xD;
who said that his little son about three years 01(1,&#xD;
governed the people of his State, and his explana-&#xD;
tion was, the child governed its mother, she gov-&#xD;
erned him and he governed the people."&#xD;
Exactly so," said the clergyman. hence poli-&#xD;
tician~, who are for the most part close observers,&#xD;
and well schooled in human nature, secure ~hi~&#xD;
class of men, and through them secure others they&#xD;
could not otherwise reach. Often a few glasses of&#xD;
liquor and a little familiarity accomplish the task."&#xD;
"What remedy would you suggest for these ills?"&#xD;
"The same," replied the clergyman, "that the&#xD;
Grecian ought to have adopted with his wife and&#xD;
child."&#xD;
"Whatis that?"&#xD;
"Sent the child to the nursery and his wife to&#xD;
the kitchen, and governed the people himself. Now,&#xD;
the great mass of the people ought to send those&#xD;
panders to vice,' howling to their kennels, and gov-&#xD;
em themselves. Then, aiid not till then, will they&#xD;
cease to have an undue influence."&#xD;
During the campaign, Alban, Lahm and Sike~&#xD;
had been, more or less, all the time, under the in-&#xD;
&#xD;
fluency of liquor; now, that the election was over,&#xD;
determined as soon as the season of rejoicing had&#xD;
passed, to fall back into the habit of occasional&#xD;
dram drinking; but they found it more difficult to&#xD;
return than go forward.&#xD;
Numerous, ratification meetings, as they called&#xD;
them,' were held in different parts of the Congres'.&#xD;
signal District, to all of which Alban and Lahm&#xD;
had an invitation, and to each invitation they in-&#xD;
variably responded, by being personally present,&#xD;
unless the meetings conflicted so a~ to render at-&#xD;
tendaiice upon all impossible. At these convivial&#xD;
meetings, Alban-Judge of the Judicial Circuit,&#xD;
composed of the same counties which made up the&#xD;
Congressiowd District,----took the lead, and the&#xD;
members of the bar followed. On some of these&#xD;
occasions might have been, seen Judges and Law~&#xD;
yers, office-holders and expectant, editors and&#xD;
deacons, grey-headed men and boys, united in tiw&#xD;
mazes of bacchanalian revelry.&#xD;
Two considerations would seem to argue against&#xD;
attempting a portrait of these drunken rows. The&#xD;
public is already too familiar with such scenes;&#xD;
and again, the bar-the van-gua~d of very many&#xD;
virtues-might not admire the picture.&#xD;
Sikes, now out of office and out of employment,&#xD;
and sure of one customer, at least, started a small&#xD;
doggery, and commenced selling spirituous liquors,&#xD;
which he kept Li operation, for some two months,&#xD;
while his 'habits of dissipation became more and&#xD;

more inveterate. At length his stock of liquors&#xD;
began to lessen, and for the purpose of recruiting&#xD;
them he procured a horse and wftgon and visited&#xD;
a neighboring distillery. After tasting the qual-&#xD;

heavy potations from the bung of the cask by&#xD;
means of a rye straw, and satisfied it was the&#xD;
article he wanted, loaded it upon his wagon.&#xD;
True to the instincts of degradation, he must&#xD;
now sponge a drink or two more by way of trying&#xD;
several other casks, he professed to think he might&#xD;
want to buy within the lapse of a few weeks. He&#xD;
accordingly had recourse to the straw, which he&#xD;
used freely upon three or four different kegs, and&#xD;
until he reeled; when he staggered to his wagon,&#xD;
and with the aid of the good Samaritan who pre-&#xD;
sided over the destinies of the still-house, he got&#xD;
in along side his barrel and began beating hi~&#xD;
horse, which evinced more restiveness than com-&#xD;
ported with the distiller's notions of Sikes' safety.&#xD;
There was now another draft upon the magna-&#xD;
nimity of this manufacturer of death. The horse&#xD;
must be quieted, which he accordingly did, and&#xD;
oi~r hero of the straw went, not on his way rejoic-'&#xD;
ing, but alternately hallooing, nodding and whip-.&#xD;
ping his animal, which was possessed of more&#xD;
sense than his poor besotted driver, or at least he&#xD;
had the merit of sobriety. He had not proceeded&#xD;
far, when, in passing down a slight declivity hi~&#xD;
wagon struck a stump and turned over; after&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
rearing and pitching for some time, the horse&#xD;
finally drew the vehicle off him, but his spirit had&#xD;
departed.&#xD;
The spirits in the barrel had also departed.~&#xD;
The head of the cask as well as Sikes, had been&#xD;
driven in, and his lifeless body was swimming in&#xD;
alcohol.&#xD;
At this moment one of the grocer's best custom-&#xD;
ers came up to the scene of disaster, and like thc&#xD;
bee when its empire is invaded and its comb&#xD;
broken, unmindful of the wreck and ruin around&#xD;
it, sips the honey. Staggering along he raised&#xD;
his hands, and in horror exclaimed, "Oh! what a&#xD;
pity to have it wasted, and knmediately got down&#xD;
or rather fell down, and guzzled from a puddle the&#xD;
liquor crimsoned with the blood of its recent&#xD;
owner.&#xD;
The natural conclusion, and one to which a so-&#xD;
ber man would be likely to arrive, is, that so sad&#xD;
an accident, induced by intemperance, would have&#xD;
caused Alban and Lahm to pause in their mad&#xD;
career and reflect. It is said that the soldier upon&#xD;
the battle field is made more furious by each addi-&#xD;
tional man who falls around him. And such wa~&#xD;
the effect of Sikes' misfortune upon Lahm and&#xD;
Alban. While it is easy to account for the in-&#xD;
creased madness under the circumstances to which&#xD;
we have alluded, of the infuriated soldier, it is be~&#xD;
yond the ken of philosophy to give a good and&#xD;
sufficientt reason for the impetus the tragical end&#xD;

Lahim-&#xD;
Lalim now began to neglect his professional as&#xD;

all his time lounging about groceries and hotels,&#xD;
and thus he would spend weeks without appear-&#xD;
ig to know or care what it mast necessarily lead&#xD;
to inthe end.&#xD;
" Mr. Lalim," said a personal and political&#xD;
friend whom he chanced to meet at one of his pla-&#xD;
ces of resort, " you must quit drinking or y ou will&#xD;
go over the dam."&#xD;
" Well," replied Lahm, " then I shall probably&#xD;
go over."&#xD;
" Why should you," exclaimed shis friend.&#xD;
"I doubt very much whether I could quit if I&#xD;
were to make the effort."&#xD;
"To doubt, is to be damned," said his friend,&#xD;
" and," continued he, " there are many things&#xD;
more difficult of accomplishment than abandon-&#xD;

I should say you were unequal, you woulthnI&#xD;

and then you can fight as becomes a man."&#xD;
Lahmi interrupted him by remarking that decla-&#xD;
mation and action were as different as could be&#xD;
well imagined. That it was easy to. theorize and&#xD;
formi plans for life, but to carry out those plans, to&#xD;
reduce them to practice, was entirely another and&#xD;
more difficult matter. " You,'' continued he,&#xD;
knoww but little about the force of this habit.--&#xD;
' When I would do good evil is present with me."'&#xD;
And then many there are who instead of reaching&#xD;
forth the helping hand, are pushing me deeperiand&#xD;
yet deeper into the slough. Men who are not hin-&#xD;
pelled by this irresistible habit to drink, are fre-&#xD;
quently encouraging me and extending invitations&#xD;
without its occuri-ing to them that I need their aid&#xD;
and assistance to avoid the pit falls that are await-&#xD;
ing my slow but certain approach-that lead me&#xD;
to the haunts of dissipation and fix the habit&#xD;
more and more indelibly."&#xD;
"Regard such men as your most deadly ene-&#xD;
mies, and stand aloof from them," said his friend,&#xD;
-" That," replied Lahm, " is easier to say than&#xD;
"No, more easily," exclaimed his friend, when&#xD;
your reputation, your all, your very life, temporal&#xD;
and eternal, is at stake. Continue this drinking&#xD;

"I know it all," returned Lahm.&#xD;
"And yet," said his friend, "you will stand in-&#xD;

"How am I to extinguish them," enquired Lahm.&#xD;
"How! why, be'a man."&#xD;
" I once was a man," mournfully said Lahm,&#xD;
"but"-&#xD;
"But what ;" quickly exclaimed his friend.-&#xD;
"Cross the Rubicon, and destroy all hope of re-&#xD;

his friend, considering further exp ostulation&#xD;
useless, left him to his apparent doom.&#xD;
Lalirn continued for several weeks to drink, and&#xD;
the only change observed was that he grew worse&#xD;
and more hopeless, lie now determined to visit&#xD;
his relatives living in another State, and was soon&#xD;
on his way. Previous to leaving he provided him-&#xD;
self with a quantity of brandy, some of which. he&#xD;
tarried in his carpet sack, to protect him against&#xD;
the contingency of passing through a temperance&#xD;
t'egion, where the article could not be had. Hay-&#xD;
it with him, he drank freely, but succeeded in&#xD;
caching his former home, where the entreaties,&#xD;
tears and prayers of a pious mother were alike&#xD;
expended upon him in vain. He remained a few&#xD;
days, but it appeared less like home than upon&#xD;
~hy former visit. It had ceased to be "home&#xD;
~xveet home" His friends were even more kind&#xD;
~han usual. Every little attention and every kind&#xD;
act that could possibly contribute to his happiness&#xD;
and comfort, were done with the object so appa-&#xD;
rent that he could not but observe it. In the midst&#xD;
of this kindness a sense of degradation and un-&#xD;
worthiness would steal across his mind and mar&#xD;
his peace.&#xD;
Finding himself unable to enjoy home, he pre-&#xD;
pared to return. As he was about to leave, his&#xD;

aged and infirm mother took him by the hand and&#xD;
said, while the tears like rain, fell from her almost&#xD;
sightless eyes, 'My son, promise me before&#xD;
heaven, you will quit drinking."&#xD;
No, mother !" he replied, " I can't." I would&#xD;
break the pledge if I made it. You taught me in&#xD;

never forgotten it'."&#xD;
Would to God." sobbed the mother, " I had&#xD;
taught you an additional lesson-the folly of drink-&#xD;

Lahui was too much affected to make any re-&#xD;
ply. his mother again said, " Won't you make&#xD;
the promise.&#xD;
Lahm, too full of emotion to answer, shook hi5&#xD;
head. " Then," continued the mother, I shall&#xD;
never see you again; never, never, shall I again&#xD;
behold my son !" and returned to the house in an&#xD;
agony of grief, while he stepped into the stage&#xD;
and was oil'.&#xD;
lie now aPpeal'ed~ to hhve cut himself loose&#xD;
from all sense of shame; though several genteel&#xD;
ladies were in the coach, he would in their pres-&#xD;
ence take from his pocket his flask, and drink free-&#xD;
ly several times in the course of an hour; and&#xD;
continued this course until some time the next&#xD;
day, xvhcn he was seized with a fit of delirium trc-&#xD;
incus; and while in this condition he would ex~&#xD;
claim in the language of David, "Deliver me 0&#xD;
my God! from the hand of the wicked."&#xD;
&#xD;
And again he would say, " Deliver me not over'&#xD;
to the will of my enemies !" " Save, oh God! or&#xD;
I pQrish."&#xD;
Moderating, he would utter all kinds of incon-&#xD;
PTuitics~dj5t~ connected and broken sentences-&#xD;
when suddenly he rose, opened the, door of the&#xD;
coach and sprang out, and went howling into a&#xD;
dense forest of many thousand acres, owned by&#xD;
distant speculators; while the coach p~'o~eeded on&#xD;
to the next station some three miles farther, where&#xD;
the people were notified of xvhat had happened.&#xD;
During the afternoon of the same day a rigid&#xD;
search was instituted, and incessantlx~ kept up&#xD;
until he was found, on the third day after the o&amp;amp;&#xD;
currdnce with his lower extremities in a small&#xD;
rivulet, with his head and upper part of the body&#xD;
upon the sloaping bank, lifeless. He was convey-&#xD;

Within the last few months we have noticed&#xD;
the death of Sibley, Sikes, and several others less&#xD;

the same cause, this accursed intemperance. It&#xD;
appears to love a shining mark. It is striking&#xD;
down the best men among us. There are scores&#xD;
of men in this community who have not yet fallen&#xD;

it go forward or backward? We cannot as an hon-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
An open foe may prove a curse,&#xD;
But a pretended friend is worse.--- Gay.&#xD;
The influences had taken' a most happy turn,&#xD;
and it was now sanguinely hoped by the philan-~&#xD;
thropic, that through the magic of this sudden&#xD;
change, Judge Alban would b~ saved from what&#xD;
had previously appeared to be his inevitable doom,&#xD;
a drunkard's grave and a drunkard's eternity.-&#xD;
But there xvas little hope for a man whose bosom&#xD;
did not contain one generous impulse, one noble&#xD;
sentiment, one manly feeling; who was a stran-&#xD;
ger to virtuous indignation, whose heart beat with&#xD;
its every throb in unison with vice and immo-&#xD;
rality; the springs to whose policy were1 oppress~&#xD;
sion, cowardice, hypocrisy, ingratitude and decep-&#xD;
tion! He heeded not the influences around him,&#xD;
nor the solemn warnings which seemed to speak&#xD;
from the graves of Sibley, Sikes and Lalim, and&#xD;
no sooner was he out of one excess than he&#xD;
plunged into another and still another, until scenes&#xD;
of debauchery and dissipation seemed to be the~&#xD;
only element in which he could "breathe, move&#xD;
or have his being."&#xD;
A few' weeks after the death of Lahm, Alban&#xD;
was loafing in the office of a lawyer whom we&#xD;

constantly studied to deceive by the wiles, arts&#xD;
and appliances of the heartless demagogue.&#xD;
"Judge," said Yellow Coat, "are you aware&#xD;
that a bill has already passed the United States&#xD;
Senate which contelnl)lates a division of our State&#xD;
into two Districts ?"&#xD;
Judge Alban, stupefied from the excesses of the&#xD;
previous night was in a state of semi-repose, par-&#xD;
tially opened his eyes and drawled out-&#xD;
What is that you are talk-talking about-&#xD;
about there ?"&#xD;
Our State is about to be divided and we will&#xD;
have two United States' Courts instead of one,"&#xD;
repeated Yellow Coat.&#xD;
"Would it benefit you or myself any, if there&#xD;
xyere twenty new courts," responded Alban.&#xD;
"I am not so certain," said Yellow Coat, " but&#xD;
one might benefit us essentially."&#xD;
"how !" exclaimed Alban. "' If I can be taught&#xD;
to believe that it may result to my benefit, then I.&#xD;
Mhall feel an interest in the movement; if not, of&#xD;

"To what ?" exclaimed Aihan.&#xD;
"Why, to a Judgeship, and that too, for life,"&#xD;
said Yellow Coat.&#xD;
"That life feature I like," said Alban. " This&#xD;
being dependent upon the vulgar herd for posi-&#xD;
tion, constantly living in dread of their disappro-&#xD;
bation- and this crawling, creeping and cringing&#xD;
to the mass for favor, is, and always has been&#xD;
greatly at war with my feelings; but then, I sup-&#xD;
pose, if the district should be made, the bench is&#xD;
entirely beyond my reach."&#xD;
" Why should it be ?" said Yellow Coat; "cci'-&#xD;
tainly with judicious management you may se~&#xD;
cure the appointment."&#xD;
"Do you think so ?" said Alban.&#xD;
"I most assuredly do," replied Yellow Coat.&#xD;
"But," continued Judge Alban, "who is to&#xD;
manage this matter? We are remote from Wash-&#xD;
ington City, and in order that it be reduced to~ a&#xD;
certainty some person must go there immediateiv~&#xD;
and every appliance within the range, ay, be-&#xD;
yond th6 range of convenience, brought to bear&#xD;
upon the President and the appointing power, that&#xD;
is necessary to effect the object, and that will re~&#xD;
quire time and money."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
204&#xD;
&#xD;
All that will be wholly unnecessary," replied&#xD;
Yellow Coat. "It can all be accomplished by&#xD;
writing to a few friends in Congress."&#xD;
~r1~his thing of writing to friends about matter~&#xD;
in which you and not they are interested, is a bu-&#xD;
siness in which I have long since ceased to have&#xD;
any confidence," exclaimed Alban.&#xD;
Oh, you nmst second the movement by money.&#xD;
Money is the fulcrum, the lever, and the whole&#xD;
moving power. That must accompany our CXCI'-&#xD;
tion at the Proper time," said Yellow Coat; "and&#xD;
now, Judge, continued he, "we are so made and&#xD;
constituted that we must learn every thing we&#xD;
know-we can know nothing by intuition. Now.&#xD;
while you have been acquainting yourself with the&#xD;
occult mysteries of science, and fathoming the&#xD;
profundities of ancient and modern legal lore, you&#xD;
have neglected the less abstruse science of politi-&#xD;

will keep you constantly advised as to the part&#xD;
you must play in the drama. It will probably be&#xD;
necessary for you to procure the recommendation&#xD;
of the Governor, Legislature, and other State ofll-&#xD;
cers."&#xD;
"You have been my friend-my warm and de-&#xD;

been down upon me; I will therefore leave the&#xD;
matter wholly in your hands," said the Judge.&#xD;

Certainly, certainly," said Yellow Coat ; I will&#xD;
however make one suggestion, and that is, you&#xD;
must have some of the nccd!ui ready for ernergeu~&#xD;
cies.&#xD;
"'I will endeavor to," rc~)lied the Judge.&#xD;
A few days after the above conversation, Yel-&#xD;
low Coat c~lIed upon the Judge fbr the nccdful,&#xD;
saying he was upon his way to the city of C-.-~-,&#xD;
for the purpose of obtaining the signatures of the&#xD;
dignitaries of the State-procured his money and&#xD;
proceeded upoli his way.&#xD;
But quite as soon as Yellow Coat could reach&#xD;
the seat of government and return, we find him&#xD;
with Judge Alban, saying he could not procure&#xD;
an endorsement of his honor the Judge, until he&#xD;
would first resign the office he held, after which&#xD;
they would all join in recommending the Judge to&#xD;
the favorable notice of the President and Cabinet.&#xD;
Immediately after Yellow Coat met the Judge,&#xD;
and before he communicated to him his want of&#xD;
success , lie swaggered and ~h~ugged up his should-&#xD;
ers with an affected involuntary shiver, and with a&#xD;
look and blink peculiarly his own, as he threw a&#xD;
massive quantity of' the weed from his cadaverous&#xD;
countenance, invited the Judge across the street&#xD;
to liquor up, to see which, was to comprehend it&#xD;
and its objects; but with accuracy and justness to&#xD;

swagger, in his countenance and demeanor, would&#xD;

After Yellow Coat and the Judge had been qui-~&#xD;
etly scaled in a genteel Saloon and drank a bran-&#xD;
dy smash, Yellow Coat~ without informing' the&#xD;
Jud~'e of his bad luck, but upon the contrary con-&#xD;
stantly avoiding any allusion to the matter, called&#xD;
in a hot whiskey punch---still trembling or affect.&#xD;
lug to shiver from the cold. Nor was it until the&#xD;
whiskey j)uncli was swallowed, and the Judge in&#xD;
turn called in the liquor two or three times, that&#xD;
the tremulous Yellow Coat ventured to mention&#xD;
to the drunken dignitary the unfavorable rel)ort ol'&#xD;
his mission, taking care to preface it with the re-&#xD;
mark that he would immediately return to the seat&#xD;
of government upon his errand of kindness.&#xD;
Alban by no means sanguine when sober, would&#xD;
not at this time have given a - groat to have had&#xD;
success insured, without ceremony or further in-&#xD;
quiry wrote out his resi0'nati on, a~d requested the&#xD;
governor to appoint Esq. Yellow Coat his sue-&#xD;

Yellow Coat, now with the resignation and r~-&#xD;

4arted for the seat of government, from whence&#xD;
in due time lie returned with his own commission,&#xD;

268            THE UNJUST JUDOE~&#xD;
&#xD;
Soon after Yellow Coat's return, Alban called&#xD;
at his office without finding him in, and then at&#xD;
his residence, but he sent the judge word lie was&#xD;
not at home. Finally, howeVer, the Judge met&#xD;
him; but, as neither Alb~n nor Yellow Coat has&#xD;
reported the result of that interview, we are una-&#xD;
ble to give it to our readers; but this much we do&#xD;
know--Judge Alban called upon Yellow Coat, of&#xD;
ten; indeed, every day, and sometimes several&#xD;
times in the course of a day; we don't know cer-&#xD;
tainly, but suppose to listen to the delusive and&#xD;
hypocritical professions of old Yellow Coat, until&#xD;
finally the new made judge, as we have been in-&#xD;
formed, and verily believe, grew impatient under&#xD;
the annoyance, when he is said to have made this&#xD;
laconic remark-&#xD;
Go home, Alban, and be patient! This thiW&#xD;
can't be accomplished in a day, nor can it be done&#xD;
in weeks."&#xD;
At this meeting', Alban, we are told, was sober,&#xD;
and as a sense of his true situal;ion stole over his&#xD;
demented mind he fixed his eye-wacant from va-&#xD;
grancy-upon the new Judge, and exclaimed with&#xD;
a tremulous voice, in tones that wrung tears from&#xD;
the eyes of the callous old Xr~llow Coat-"EI 14&#xD;

From the flattery and professions of old Yellow&#xD;

"I'll show Charles Edward that there are other&#xD;

"What!" replied his wife, "Ed., the Irish dray-&#xD;

"You usually look upon what you call the vulgar,&#xD;

"Immense nonsense-" retorted Mrs. Alban..-.-&#xD;
"Ed. is not worth a dime, and you will find that it&#xD;
~s an immense hoax he is practicing upon your&#xD;

"Oh! fudge," said the Judge, "let me have&#xD;

"Consult my interest this once," said Alban,&#xD;
" and you~ may live to see the day when you will&#xD;

" I will live to see you laughed .at extensively,&#xD;

The Judge unwilling to trust his note in the&#xD;

want of confidence-carried it himself.&#xD;
When the Judge reached a small hovel in the&#xD;
suburbs of the town, where he supposed M'Gugin&#xD;
resided, he knocked for admission. Soon the door&#xD;
opened, and a female not remarkable for the neat-&#xD;

" Yes, Madam, I wish to see 'Squire M'Gugin,"&#xD;

Judge Alban that he had just stepped into the&#xD;

ty thousand dollars-which she .did with great&#xD;

" Then," exclaimred the Juidge, " the 'Squire has&#xD;

* nya small amount," was the ready response.&#xD;
" Sufficient to pay- expenses in getting the bal-&#xD;
ance," exclaimed Alban, as he threw the note of&#xD;
invitation down at her feet, and broke at the top&#xD;
of his speed like a tiger upon a fresh trail of&#xD;
blood, for "'Squire M'Gugin" and the bank. But&#xD;
before he came up to "'Squire M'Gugin," the&#xD;
bubble had burst, though not until a score or more,&#xD;
(and many of them young lawyers,) had been let&#xD;
into the secret and who had been watching his&#xD;
movements upon the street, enjoyed a fine&#xD;
laugh at the expense of the unfortunate digni-&#xD;

Flattery being the oniy avenue through which&#xD;
Alban could be approached, he fell into the too&#xD;
common error of estimating others by his own ca-&#xD;

and villains ; and hence he invariably attempted&#xD;
to accomplish his purposes through a free and libe-&#xD;

To the sins which, as we have seen, covered&#xD;
Alban as with a mantle, he added others which&#xD;
involved the most sacred inteifest of man as well&#xD;
as woman, and would have enabled him to pass&#xD;
par excellence in the regions of Mecca and Salt&#xD;

The throne of the Stuarts which excited him&#xD;
when first it engrossed his thoughts, had now less&#xD;

mint julep, or the fumes of a whiskey punch.&#xD;
But the avenger of virtue and injured innocence&#xD;

had at this time but little relish. The allurements&#xD;
of an enchanted home were not his ; no interest,&#xD;

upon her health, which was perceived by her hus-&#xD;

she should retire at her usual time.&#xD;
" And have you come cold, and perhaps hungry~"&#xD;
said she. "I could not think of that."&#xD;
Coming home one morning, he saw the light in&#xD;
the sitting room, as usual, and curious to know how&#xD;
his wife whiled away the tedious hours, softly step&#xD;
ped to a window and, through the crevices in the&#xD;
shutters, he saw her in apparent deep devotion,&#xD;
but could hear nothing except an occasional sob.&#xD;
After some moments, he walked up to the door and&#xD;
entered, near which she met him as usual, all kind~&#xD;

or trouble.&#xD;
Jones took a seat near the fire, in a more thought-&#xD;

more than he could endure without emotion, which&#xD;
he chose not to exhibit, and accordingly left the&#xD;
room to give vent to his pent up feelings. After&#xD;
some fifteen minutes he returned, but partook&#xD;
sparingly of the tea, and soon retired.&#xD;

took his old position at the window.&#xD;
Soon after his departure, she opened the family&#xD;
bible and read a chapter or two, and then kneeled&#xD;
down, and again he beheld her engaged in prayer.&#xD;
She was not far from the window, where he stood&#xD;
a silent spectator of the (to him) imposing scene.&#xD;
lie could distinctly hear her, in a tremulous voicc~&#xD;

"Lord lay not this sin to his charge-' snatch&#xD;
him as a brand from the burning.' Restore hini&#xD;
to sobriety. Thou hast endowed him with much&#xD;
1~leiit. Oh God, forbid that he bury it."&#xD;
He could only catch an occasional sentence,&#xD;
~oxne of which we have given above; but he was&#xD;
conquered, lie stepped upon the threshold of the&#xD;
door and entered, after an absence of iiearly an&#xD;
hour. She met him with a countenance beaming-&#xD;
with joy, and exclaimed, "Why, my dear) you are&#xD;
home early this evenino-"&#xD;
"Not so early as I 6hall be tomorrow evening,"&#xD;
he replied; and continued, "It is all over. You&#xD;
have conquered me, and I am myself again."&#xD;
She threw her arms around him, and cried aloud&#xD;
from very joy.&#xD;
"I am," exclaimed Judge Jones, "from this mo~&#xD;
inent, a 'Maine Law' man, come ~vhat may."&#xD;
They took a seat by the fire, and while she wa~&#xD;
i~ extacics he was sombre and thoughtful. In a&#xD;

few moments he turned and looked her full in the&#xD;
face, as he said, "You knew it all, then ?"&#xD;
She smiled as she nodded, and said: "Gray tel1~&#xD;
us-&#xD;
"Where ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise."&#xD;
He quickly replied, that a greater man than&#xD;
Gr~y has said-&#xD;
"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty."&#xD;
With a sweet voice and a smiling countenance,&#xD;
she said, "The wjse man from whom you have&#xD;
just quoted, says, 'Wine is a mocker, strong drink&#xD;
is raging, and whosoever is deceived thereby is not&#xD;
wise.' I knew you could not long be deceived.&#xD;
XTOU have too much mind for that."&#xD;
"But," returned he, "why 4id you not scold, get&#xD;
mad, and smash things?"&#xD;
"That would have done no ~ood, and might&#xD;
have done much harm."&#xD;
"I think that is likely-your course was the&#xD;
better."&#xD;
She was well acquainted with the Judge's vir~&#xD;
tues as well as his imperfection's. Now that he h~d&#xD;
determined to quit, she felt he could not be driven&#xD;
from his purpose; and, therefore, conversed with&#xD;
him freely, and ventured to enquirer how the sud~&#xD;
den change came.&#xD;
He replied that he was seldom ignorant of what&#xD;
was going o&amp;amp;around him.&#xD;
She did n~A frilly comprehend him, and inquired&#xD;
how she was to understand him.&#xD;
&#xD;
286&#xD;
&#xD;
287&#xD;
&#xD;
lIe replied, "You have saved me." And, after&#xD;
musing a fexv moments, he exclaimed, "what a&#xD;
fate I have escaped! "When I look back, now&#xD;
that I am sober, and not excited, how I shudder.&#xD;
Oh, what a perilous race I' was running! How&#xD;
few that enter upon that course, stop short of the&#xD;
goal-ruin and death."&#xD;
"Since your unfortunate Hamlin trouble, I have&#xD;
been, during my every waking hour, (and my&#xD;
slee&#xD;
ping ones have been few) brooding over your&#xD;
dangers, but I have never despaired of your ulti-&#xD;
mate return to virtue.&#xD;
"'low much I am indebted to you."&#xD;
No," said she; "but on the contrary, hdw&#xD;
many ten thousand obligations I am under to you,&#xD;
my natural protector, for turning your back upon&#xD;
a most seductive vice, w~iich, when persisted in,&#xD;
must end in wreck and ruin."&#xD;
Mrs. Jones, that night, retired to pleasant slum..&#xD;
hers without any dread of the future.&#xD;
Next morning who should make his appearance&#xD;
but Leblond? Neither knew of the change that&#xD;
had taken place in the other. Each, however soon&#xD;
({iscovere(I that his friend was perfectly sober, and&#xD;
free from the influence of liquor, and it was what&#xD;
could not have been said of either for many months&#xD;
previous to thefr recent reformation.&#xD;
Our two friends were soon engaged in conver-&#xD;
sation upon the fate of Sikes, Lahm, Sibley ahd&#xD;
Alban. When alluding to Sibley, Leblond was&#xD;

I&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
affected to tears, and paid a handsome tribute to&#xD;
his memory.&#xD;
"I," said Leblond, "am now in easy circum~tan-&#xD;
ces, and expect to be wealthy at no distant period;&#xD;
but if as poor as Lazarus, I would be bound by&#xD;
every principle of right, and of honor, to support&#xD;
his destitute family. I now have the two boys in&#xD;
college, and there they shall remain at my expense&#xD;
until their education is complete, after which I in-&#xD;
tend taking them into my office, and give them&#xD;
each a thorough legal education; and that is prob-&#xD;
ably more than the unfortunate father could have&#xD;
done, h~d he lived. That angel that hovered&#xD;
about his path and was instrumental in his refor-&#xD;
mation when in prison, but who dropped the cur-&#xD;
tain upon his earthly career, is now in the Lunatic&#xD;
Asylum, also at my cost."&#xD;
"Why," said Jones, now choked with emotion,&#xD;
and relieved only by a shower of tears, "Leblond,&#xD;
that is manly."&#xD;
"It i~ naked justice to the wretched family whom&#xD;
I have robbed of their protector; and, could I have&#xD;
persuaded myself there was no God, no heaven,&#xD;
no hell, no retribution nor happiness beyond the&#xD;
grave-~till, I would have done what I have done.&#xD;
Yet, if it is true philosophy and good morality, that&#xD;
the moral turpitude of the act is estimated by the&#xD;
intention, then, indeed, am I guiltless of the blood&#xD;
of poor Sibley. It is true that the man who wreck-&#xD;
lesely discharges hg rifle into a crowd, and kills,&#xD;

without intending so to do, is guilty of murder-&#xD;
this is probably good law as well as good sense.&#xD;
Upon that principle, I would have been responsible&#xD;
had I been sober when I went to his office."&#xD;
"But, brother Leblond," said the Judge," drunk-&#xD;
enness does not excuse crime."&#xD;
"Then," said Leblond, "I am guilty of murder;&#xD;
and, had liamlin been executed, which he would&#xD;
have been but for the interference of Providence,&#xD;
you would have occupied a no less enviable posi-&#xD;
tton.&#xD;
"XYhile I have been more guilty than you," re-&#xD;
plied Judge Jones, "I have been more fortunate."&#xD;
"Judge, I sometime, and of late particularly,&#xD;
feel very much like quarreling with that principle&#xD;
of law that refuses to make drunkenness an ex-&#xD;
cuse for crime."&#xD;
"It works hardship occasionally," responded&#xD;
Jones; "But, perhaps, not more often, nor greater&#xD;
than other general rules. Suppose the general&#xD;
rule was established that drunkenness could be&#xD;
urged as a defence. Then, sir, all a man would&#xD;
have to do, if he meditated a deadly injury against&#xD;
his neighbor, would be to get as drunk as bacehus,&#xD;
or even to affect drunkenness; and under the rule&#xD;
he could with impunity, commit any and all sorts&#xD;
of crime and outrage."&#xD;

tried in Judge Lynch's Court. It would have made&#xD;
my crime none the less to have made it public,&#xD;
while it might have crippled me in my efforts to&#xD;
repair the injury. But there has not been siuce&#xD;
the occurrence a day, i~or scarcely an hour in the&#xD;
day, when the remembrance of this melancholy&#xD;
event has not come rushing upon my thoughts&#xD;
with the fearful effects of the desolating tornado;&#xD;
and did I not possess an iron will and the power&#xD;
of saying, 'thus far and no farther, and here let&#xD;
thy proud waves be stayed,' I should have been&#xD;
overwhelmed, and met a more tragical cud than&#xD;
the unfortunate victim of my folly."&#xD;
"You have," said Jones, "done all that could&#xD;
have been done; and you will allow me to con-&#xD;
gratulate you upon your ability to drive back the&#xD;
unbidden thoughts that would have haunted me&#xD;
till the ~'latest syllable of recorded time,' had&#xD;
Ilamlin been executed. I also think you acted&#xD;
wisely, concealing your agency in the fatal tra~-&#xD;
gedy of the lamented Sibley, from the public, as&#xD;
it could have done no good and might have done&#xD;
great harm. But," continued Jones, "I believe I&#xD;
wonld have dreaded .Judge Alban's Court quite as&#xD;
much as LyncVs."&#xD;
~ By no means;" immediately replied Leblond-.&#xD;
Aiban-Judge Alban and myself were upon&#xD;
most intiina~ terms of friendship at that time.-&#xD;
It is true that since I have become, as II fancy, a&#xD;
better man, he is down upon me."&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
That would have afforded you no protection,"&#xD;
said Jones. "A man is always unsafe in the&#xD;
hands of a Court, more under the control of ~pre-&#xD;
,j udice and passion, whims and caprices, than&#xD;
sound legal principles or morale worth; and by the&#xD;
way, I have heard, it seems to me, that the old&#xD;
bloat was dead."&#xD;
Yes, he is," said Leblond, "and his death was&#xD;
tragical-nearly as much so as Sibley's, Sikes,' or&#xD;
Lahtn's. Lie had become much more corrupt than&#xD;
any of them."&#xD;
I knew," said Jones, "very little of Sheriff&#xD;
$ikcs; but from what I have seen of Sibley and&#xD;
Lahm, I would think them men of considerable&#xD;
talent, and disposed generally in all their acts and&#xD;
doings to be governed .by the strictest rules of&#xD;
i~ight.-whiJc I have never had any confidence&#xD;
in Alban, and certainly less, since he got Jewett&#xD;
out of his trouble. elATe love the treason but hate&#xD;
the traitor."&#xD;
"We should tread lightly upon the ashes of' the&#xD;
dead,' is a sentiment that wells up from the bot-&#xD;
tom of all hearts of ordinary sensibility, yet be-&#xD;
tween us, Judge, who are alike acquainted with&#xD;
the frailties, imperfections and vices of Aiban, he&#xD;
had not only his weak, very weak points, but he&#xD;
was corrupt; perhaps not exactly corrupt with&#xD;
iiialice pr~1pcrssc, but from the force of passion and&#xD;
prejudice; he usually manifested great reckless~&#xD;

"Justice sooner or later overtakes men of that&#xD;
character-it is sometimes slow but always cer~&#xD;

"To this tardiness," "responded Leblond,&#xD;

Dinner was now announced, and our friends&#xD;

"We've had a general time of rejoicing," said&#xD;
Mrs. Jones, while the unbidden tear gathered and&#xD;
stole down her face, now flushed with emotion.&#xD;
"The rejoicing is of rather a recent date," re-&#xD;
marked the Judge; but with sombre brow and&#xD;
strong ~pb~sis, ad~kd-'~' better late than never.'&#xD;
The ladies," continued he, "hive much more pen-&#xD;
etration than we gentlemen have been in the habit&#xD;
of ascribing to theim It might be well for you to&#xD;
look to this matter, as you are already in the liv-&#xD;
menial trap."&#xD;
"Not in," replied Leblond, yet I must confess I&#xD;
may find it exceedingly difficult to bxeak away&#xD;
from its influence, if it was thought desirable."&#xD;
"'F hat 'if it was thought desirable,' is a most&#xD;
interesting and important provision," said Mrs.&#xD;
Jones.&#xD;
Leblond, feeling that he occupied tender ground,&#xD;
changed the conversation by remarking, that he,&#xD;
too, felt considerable interest in this r~jo~eing, to&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7936-00000148"/>&#xD;
which an allusion had been made. "I would in-&#xD;
fer," continued Leblond, addressing himself to Mrs.&#xD;
Jones, "that the Judge supposed these sprees in&#xD;
which we have been indulging were sub rosa so far&#xD;
as you were concerned?"&#xD;
Remarkable for her great prudence as well as&#xD;
her sterling good sense, Mrs. Jones looked at the&#xD;
Judge, and significantly smiled, but made no fuv-~&#xD;
ther reply.&#xD;
"Mr. Leblond," said the Judge, "these wives&#xD;
are excellent in their place. But~for them and their&#xD;
happy influences upon man and his destiny, we&#xD;
should have, very soon, an entirely different state&#xD;
of things."&#xD;
Leblond, so recently from a visit to Amelia,&#xD;
could have said pretty things, strong things, and&#xD;
tender things, but was afraid to trust himself upon&#xD;
the subject of wives, and their excellences, lest he&#xD;
might say soft things; looked wise, but was silent.&#xD;
Mrs. Jones' keen eye, and sensitive P~eling', dis-&#xD;
covered Leblond's embarrassment, and she sought&#xD;
to relieve him by remarking that Wives were like&#xD;
husbands-good, better, best; and probably, bad,&#xD;
worse, worst-and sugge stedto him the importance&#xD;
of having his the best, as the marriage relation&#xD;
would have an important influence upon all his&#xD;
relations in life, for good or evil, unless he should&#xD;
happen to be so unfortunate as to marry a nega-&#xD;
tive character-a kind of nondiscript-one who&#xD;
has not sufficient 'force of character to make a&#xD;
&#xD;
294&#xD;
&#xD;
mark of ahy description. She now discovered that&#xD;
he was still more embarrassed than before.&#xD;
The Judge came to her aid, by remarking, that&#xD;
one who could niake no ntark was certainly more&#xD;
harmless than one who makes a strong mark, and&#xD;
averse to his interest.&#xD;
Table talk over, Jones and Leblond entered the&#xD;
drawing room.&#xD;
Leblond," said the Judge, " what about this&#xD;
Maine Law,' this coming winter ?"&#xD;
"I am iii for it," said Leblond, "until its passage&#xD;
is affected, aftei~ which the law shall be executed&#xD;
in my neighborhood at least."&#xD;
"That gives me unmixed pleasure," said the&#xD;
Judge, both simultaneously rising and grasping&#xD;
each other's hand with a cordiality they had never&#xD;
before manifested.&#xD;
"IBy what means have you been converted from&#xD;
the error of your ways ?" said Leblond.&#xD;
"My wife has done iL" said the Judge.&#xD;
What blessed beings these wives are!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Leblond. "i[ am indebted to the same&#xD;
influence for a change which, a few weeks since,&#xD;
I little dreamed of."&#xD;
"What," quickly replied the Judge, "you are&#xD;
not married?"&#xD;
"No," stammered Leblond, " but 1 expect to be."&#xD;
"That is sufficient,'~ said the Judge, "I under-&#xD;

"Ndw," said Judge Jones, "this Maine LaiV&#xD;
must be passed by the next legislature; and ,'~&#xD;
continued he, "it can be accomplished, if prop-&#xD;
erly taken hold of. I for one am willing to devote&#xD;
one year's toil to it !"&#xD;
"No man has greater atonements to make than&#xD;
myself' for past offenees," said Leblond; "but I&#xD;
confess I scarcely know where to commence or&#xD;
how to begin."&#xD;

Against the weather.gage of laws,"&#xD;
was one thing, while managing a warm contest in&#xD;
which a great moral question was involved, was a&#xD;
different matter; and one in which he had no ex-&#xD;
perience, yet he had resolved to make his mark&#xD;
without regard to the many friends it might alie~~&#xD;
nate.&#xD;
"Leblond," said the Judge, "we must be&#xD;
"heroes iu the strife."&#xD;
"Ay, and martyrs too, if necessary," replied&#xD;
Leblond.&#xD;
"That sacrifice will not be required," said the&#xD;
Judge, "unless I have failed to comprehend the&#xD;
indications. The masses are beginning to think,&#xD;
and think correctly upon this subject, and all we&#xD;
have to do is to procure the enactment of the law&#xD;
and the people will sustain it."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"The people seldom disregard their tru-e inter-&#xD;
ests; and if they think candidly in relation to this&#xD;
matter they will unUoubtedly sustain it upon that&#xD;
ground," said Leblond. "But what are your tac-&#xD;
tics, Judge ?"&#xD;
"We must observe system in this fight. It will&#xD;
be a fierce one, and if we engage in it without&#xD;
first marshaling our strength and drilling our for-&#xD;
ces, we arc vanquished; rely upon it!&#xD;
"My plan is to secure the press, a most potent&#xD;
and powerful influence; and that must be effected&#xD;
at as early a date as possible; and immediately&#xD;
after the meeting of the legislature we must be~&#xD;
siege the State Capitol, and infest the law making'&#xD;
power until they capitulate upon our own terms.&#xD;
"Another idea has just occurred to me, "con-&#xD;
tinued the Judge; "female influence must be&#xD;
brought to bear upon this question. Our wives&#xD;
must accompany us to the city. Do you under-&#xD;
stand that? Mr. Leblond. Kames tells us that&#xD;
'Gijef as well as joy is infectious."&#xD;
"Now, we must infect the city with our sentiment.&#xD;
Sympathy is quite as contagious as grief or joy.&#xD;
rfei~perance men and women must be thrown into&#xD;
the city until they are as numerous as the locusts&#xD;
of Egypt: an excitement must be got up and the&#xD;
thing carried by storm."&#xD;
~~rrhat looks well as a theory," said Leblond&#xD;
but will it work well in practice. Where arc&#xD;

"IL have an extensive acquaintance among the&#xD;

and they are the active men-the thinking men&#xD;
and the speaking men-the men who give tone&#xD;
and character to public sentiment-can set them&#xD;
all in a blaze. And they will shape the course of&#xD;
the public prints in their respective localities, and&#xD;
we will soon have a vast army in the field 'armed&#xD;
and equipped according to law,"' said the Judge,&#xD;
with great fervor.&#xD;
"That will do," replied Leblond. "But would&#xD;
it not be well to write immediately to Jiamlin,&#xD;
Jewett, Barber, and some twenty other active law-&#xD;
yers in different parts of the State, and secure&#xD;
their, immediate co-op oration?"&#xD;
"No," returned the Judge," "we must see them&#xD;
personally."&#xD;
Our two friends next morning, in different di-&#xD;
rections, wei~e on their mission of "peace and&#xD;
good will to men."&#xD;
In about ten days after they separatede, Jones&#xD;
received the following note:&#xD;
M~ DEAR JONES :-Your plan is working like a&#xD;
charm. I find no difficulty in enlisting the editors&#xD;
generally, and the lawyers almost universally.-&#xD;
The clergymen are, with scarcely an exception,&#xD;
engaged in this reformation. A few demagogues,&#xD;

of the storm we shall raise.&#xD;
Keep the ball in motion, and let me hear from&#xD;
~rou soon.&#xD;
I am very truly yours,&#xD;
L. LEBLOND."&#xD;
The election was now over; and hence the ob-&#xD;
jeet of Jones and Leblond in traveling the State&#xD;
was to create an excitement they could bring to&#xD;
hear upon the Legislative body, soon to meet at&#xD;
time seat of government.&#xD;
Jones had seen Ilamlin and had a long inter-&#xD;
view with him; and the day after Jones and Ham-&#xD;
un separated, Jewett and the Senator started-&#xD;
~~ne east and the other west, animated with the&#xD;
hope that the days of the fell monster, intempe-&#xD;
iance, were numbered.&#xD;
Leblond in company with Barber, spent some&#xD;
three weeks in passing from city to city, and from&#xD;
town to town. They made no speeches, but qui-&#xD;
etly pursued their way through different parts of&#xD;
the State, securing as th~y went along, the bar and&#xD;
the press, with the promise of flaming editorials&#xD;
and heavy delegations to the State Capitol, du-&#xD;
ring the session of the Legislature.&#xD;
Leblond resolved on having Amelia witness his&#xD;
efforts at the State Capitol, took up his line of&#xD;

march for Mr. Leonard's, where a few days after&#xD;
his arrival, his marriage was solemnized amidst&#xD;
great pomp and splendor, and was soon thereafter&#xD;
on hi~ way to the seat of government, where he&#xD;
expected to meet Jewett, Barber, Judge Jones and&#xD;
numerous other distinguished legal gentlemen and&#xD;
prominent politicians from different parts of the&#xD;

Two or three days previous to the meeting of&#xD;
the Legislature, Judge Jones repaired to the seat&#xD;
of government, xvhere he had the gratification of&#xD;
finding Jewett, I3aiber, L&amp;amp;blond, Hamlin, Tomp-&#xD;
~~ins and numerous other members of the bar, edi~&#xD;
tore and supporters of the Maine Law, clad in ar~&#xD;
mor for the coming fight.&#xD;
A meeting of the friends of the measure was&#xD;
privately called, to which Judge Jones submitted&#xD;
a bill he had previously prepared with great care.&#xD;
In some respects it xvas more stringent, and in&#xD;
oilers it was less so, than the Maine Law.&#xD;
After some discussion the bill was adopted with&#xD;
an additional provision, which made the third in-&#xD;
fraction of the law, a Penitentiary offence; and&#xD;
in case the Prosecuting Attorney neglected or re-&#xD;
fused vigorously to prosecute the same, it was&#xD;
made the duty of the Judge of the Court, to dis-&#xD;
miss him from office-appoint another in his&#xD;
stead, and to strike his name from the list of pro-&#xD;

The bill thus prepared and amtmdcd, was take3~&#xD;
by Tompkins with the promise that at the earliest&#xD;

No sooner had the Senate elected its officers&#xD;
and appointed the committees, than Tompkins&#xD;
rose in his place in the Senate, and offered the&#xD;
Bill, by which the Senate was taken by surpri~e~&#xD;
and quite a sensation produced.&#xD;
Tompkins was a leading spirit in that body, and&#xD;
at the head of a Political party which it was sup~&#xD;
posed would generally oppose the passage of the&#xD;
Bill; and hence it struck terror in the ranks of&#xD;
the enemies of the measure.&#xD;
At the period of which we are now writing, the&#xD;
city was filled with strangers beyond precedent;&#xD;
and while the temperance cause had scores upon&#xD;
scores of the most prominent members of the bar&#xD;
from different portions of the State, the whiskey&#xD;
influence had got up no inconsiderable outside&#xD;
pressure.&#xD;
The distillers, grocers and retailers of ai~1eut&#xD;
spirits, in every nook and corner of~ the ~iate.&#xD;
were immediately after the introduction of the&#xD;
Bill, notified of their danger, and very soon had&#xD;
their representatives in the city. Their calling&#xD;
was in jeopardy, and they had spilled out their&#xD;

money like water, resolved that the work of death&#xD;
should go on.&#xD;
Jt was soon ascertained that the Bill was in lit-&#xD;
~le danger in the Senate, yet it was desirable that&#xD;
it should pass that body by as large a majority as&#xD;
possible, for the prestige it would have upon the&#xD;
lower house, where the great fight would be made.&#xD;
At Judge Jones' room as well as at Leblond~s,&#xD;
a caucus was held every few evenings, where, the&#xD;
iwoper time for bringing up the measure in the&#xD;
Senate, was discussed and finally determined.&#xD;
Now, that the period for discussing the Bill in&#xD;
the Senate was fixed, Ilamlin, Tompkins and five&#xD;
or six other prominent members of the Senate.&#xD;
of each of the political parti Cs, began vigorously&#xD;
to prepare for~ the conflict.&#xD;
While Ilamlin was to argue the constitution~&#xD;
ahity of the "Law," Tompkins, who was distin-&#xD;
guished for his rhetorical as well as oratorical&#xD;
powers, was designated to make a popular speech,&#xD;
in which all the evils upon domestic happiness,&#xD;
upon social life, upon the body politic, upon our&#xD;
hopes beyond the tomb, were to pass in revision.&#xD;
Several other accomplished and powerful advo-&#xD;
cates of the Bill, were detailed to enter the fight,&#xD;
armed with wit, sarcasm, declamation or argu-&#xD;
nient at such time and place in the progress of&#xD;
~he debate, as exigencies might seem to require.&#xD;
The day at length arrived for the discussion&#xD;
and three or four hours before the time fixed by&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7936-00000153"/>&#xD;
the Senate to assemble, the hail of the Senate&#xD;
was filled to its utmost capacity.&#xD;
As Leblond and Judge Jones, now recognized&#xD;
as the great champions of the Law," entered arm&#xD;
in arm, the ladies in the gallery began and kept&#xD;
up for several minutes, a waving of their white&#xD;
handkerchiefs. "Leblond," said the Judge, "we&#xD;
must be content with being silent spectators of all&#xD;
this glory."&#xD;
"I," returned Leblond, " would give the guber-&#xD;
natorial chair, if 1 owned it, for six years, ye''&#xD;
"added he, "I would exchange a seat in the Uni-&#xD;
ted States Senate for twelve years, for an oppor-&#xD;
tunity of meeting these champions of Rum in this&#xD;
debate."&#xD;
"Rave you seen an article which appears in the&#xD;
Forum, printed at C-~," said Leblond.&#xD;
"No, I have not," replied the Judge.&#xD;
Leblond took the paper from his pocket and&#xD;
handed it to Jones, who read as follows:&#xD;
"We have been watching the signs in the po-&#xD;
litical horizon since the election, with more than&#xD;
ordinary interest, and have come to the conclu-&#xD;
sion there is every where in the State, exhibiting&#xD;
itself a deliberate, yet a quiet and unobtrusive&#xD;
purpose, to enact the Maine Law; certainly none&#xD;
the less dangerous on account of its being co-&#xD;
vertly gotten up, and clandestinely managed.&#xD;

"Our political opponents can have from principle,&#xD;
no strong partialities for the Maine Law; nor&#xD;
can we see how they can consistently support ~&#xD;

"No party, of which we have any knowledge&#xD;
as a party, has ever been more grossly addicted&#xD;
to intemperance, than the party now evidently try.~&#xD;
lug to ride this last and most contemptible of all&#xD;

horror at the evils of intemperance, manifestly for&#xD;
the purpose of gaining' the political ascendency.&#xD;
"Now, we call upon our friends in the Legisla-&#xD;

party was a vast army of drunkards; and this ob-&#xD;
viously for the purpose of drawing largely upon&#xD;

party.&#xD;
"We would say to our friends in the Legisla-&#xD;

" We claim always to -have been in favor of&#xD;
temperance, and still are ; and yet we oppose the&#xD;
Maine La w for the reason that we believe it is at&#xD;
this time thrust into politics by designing knaves,&#xD;
for the purpose of dividing and conquering ; and&#xD;
the men who are bawling temperance the loudest&#xD;
care the least for the interests of outraged, suffer-&#xD;
ing humanity."&#xD;
After reading the abovc article, Judge Jones very&#xD;
coolly remarked, that it impecached the head as&#xD;
well as the heart of the editor, and was well cal-&#xD;
culated to destroy confidence, as well in his integ-&#xD;
rity as in his ability, and impair any influence he&#xD;
might have been able, from the position he occu-&#xD;
pied, to have exerted over his fellow men.&#xD;
" That. thought," said Leblond, "1bas never&#xD;
sufficiently moulded the actions and shaped the&#xD;
course, of our public men-too many of them&#xD;
seek a gratification of their feelings or a present&#xD;
interest, at the cost of future usefulness and dis-&#xD;
tinction."&#xD;
" There are," replied Judge Jones, " so many&#xD;
methods by which public men lose caste, and are&#xD;
reduced to a level with the people, that it is by no&#xD;
means strange that prominent public characters&#xD;
find it a most arduous task, for any considerable&#xD;
length of time, to retain public faVor."&#xD;

THE UNJUST- JUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Ah !" responded Leblond, " as we look down&#xD;
the declivity of entombed ages, what mournful&#xD;
proofs meet our vision, of the fearful fickleness of&#xD;
public favor. In ancient times, to become a great&#xD;
master or benefactor of our race, was to court a&#xD;
violent death, often by the axe of State, but more&#xD;
frequently by the private dagger."&#xD;
" Modern times," answered the Judge, "have&#xD;
only improved upon the usages and cruelties of&#xD;
remote and barberous ages. When a master spi-&#xD;
rit arose and became troublesome to the ignorant&#xD;
.masses, in battling their prejudices, crushing and&#xD;
demolishing forever their errors and false theories,&#xD;
they decapitated him to make room for less men.&#xD;
" But in these days of Christian illumination&#xD;
and benevolence-amid the effulgence of science&#xD;
and the progress of arts, civilization and refine-&#xD;
ment-as soon as a man renders himself conspi-&#xD;
cuous and distinguished for valuable service ren-&#xD;
dered the State, whether in the cabinet or in the&#xD;
field-envy, jealousy, hate, ambition and desire&#xD;
for place-commission their emissaries and send&#xD;
them forth to hurt and destroy, and soon a great&#xD;
statesman, philosopher and philanthropist, lies&#xD;
festering in his wounds, equally unable to live and&#xD;
unable to die."&#xD;
"I think too," exclaimed Leblond, "that there&#xD;
was more humanity in the barbarity that struck&#xD;
off their heads and placed their victims beyond&#xD;
the reach of .physical ills, than there is in the&#xD;

tainly a shipwrecked politician and broken down&#xD;
statesman, enjoy fewer of the sweets and endure&#xD;
more of the bitters of life, than any other descrip-&#xD;
tion of character. But we have wandered," con-&#xD;
tinued Leblond, "from the point, and now to re~-&#xD;
turn to that article; what will be the effect of it ?'~&#xD;
" One effect will be," said Judge Jones, " to&#xD;
read you and myself out of the party."&#xD;
And if that, then more than that," replied&#xD;
Leblond. "All of our political party who attended&#xD;
and took an active part in the recent tempe-&#xD;
rance convention held in this city. The largest&#xD;
convention ever held here for any purpose; and a&#xD;
large majority of those in attendance 'belonged&#xD;
to our political party, and some of the most dis-&#xD;
tinguished men in the State; and yet that little&#xD;
petty editor of a little petty country paper, will&#xD;
take upon himself the responsibility of attempt-&#xD;
ing to ostracise us all. It is a most fortunate cir-&#xD;
cumstance for us that he does not wield a power-&#xD;
ful pen."&#xD;
"If he had been worshiping at the shrine of&#xD;
Bacehus for a series of years," said Jones, "that&#xD;
kind of squib would not be unaccountable; but I&#xD;
am told he is a sober man."&#xD;

"Oh! yes," replied Leblond, quite a temperate&#xD;

churches of his village."&#xD;
"That can't be possible," exclaimed Jones.-..&#xD;
Leblondyou must be in error. A man kneel and&#xD;
pray for the coming o~ Emanuel's Kingdom, and&#xD;
at the same time pander to this vice, which like&#xD;
the mighty oak, towers above all the sins of our&#xD;
race, is showing its horrid and gigantic head-the&#xD;
mother of all vice-the head and front of old Dia-&#xD;
boles', army. There is in this too much incon-&#xD;
sistency for even fallen and erring humanity."-&#xD;
It is so," said Leblond. "I am well acquainted&#xD;
with him."&#xD;
"Well," exclaimed Jones, "I suppose he con-&#xD;
tributes occasionally for nhissionary purposes ?"&#xD;
"I believe he does," answered Leblond.&#xD;
"Well," continued Jones, "we ought to raise a&#xD;
fund for the purpose of having a few hundreds of&#xD;
the Chinese imported into this country as tempe-&#xD;
rance missionaries. They refused, you will rec-&#xD;
ollect, to have the British opium crammed down&#xD;
their throats, until the superiority of English sci-&#xD;

cities, ~nd slaughtered them with a barbarity and&#xD;

And yet opium eating is attended with less fear-&#xD;

distinguished more than the other for 'bacehana-&#xD;
han revelry,' is that any reason why it should not&#xD;
reform? upon the contrary, is it not a~ sufficient&#xD;
reason if no other existed, for its taking the lead&#xD;
in removing the rock upon which it split ?"&#xD;
"From my observation," said Judge Jones,&#xD;
"drunkenness is confined to neither party, nor&#xD;
does it prevail to a greater extent in one than&#xD;
another."&#xD;
ilamlin now obtained the floor and proceeded&#xD;
to address the Senate.&#xD;
He commenced by saying: Though lie had&#xD;
from early boyhood to the present moment been&#xD;
an advocate of temperance~ yet the evils of that&#xD;
monster vice had fallen upon him with most crush-&#xD;
ing weight, but that his purpose at that time was&#xD;
simply to remove doubts which he understood ex-&#xD;
isted in certain quarters, as to the constitutionality&#xD;
of the measure.&#xD;
He went on to remark, that it was strange how&#xD;
any well informed mind since 1813, could doubt&#xD;
upon that question. "in that year," continued&#xD;
he, "Congress passed an act entitled 'An act&#xD;
for laying duties on licenses to retailers of wines,&#xD;
spirituous liquors and foreign merchandise,' which&#xD;
contained a provision he read as follows:&#xD;
"Provided always, that n-o license shall be&#xD;
granted to any person to sell wines, distilled spir~&#xD;
ituous liquors or merchandise, who is prohibited&#xD;
therefrom to sell the same by the States"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
310&#xD;
&#xD;
And maintained with great force and power,&#xD;
that it was clearly and manifestly implied in the&#xD;
passage of the law, that a State had the right to&#xD;
prohibit the manufacture, sale or barter of any&#xD;
article which was detrimental to the public web&#xD;
fare; and insisted with equal clearness and&#xD;
poxxTem' that the control of the internal trade was&#xD;
reserved to the States.&#xD;
But," "continued he, "all doubts must be&#xD;
forever dissipated, since the decisions of the Su-&#xD;
preme Court of the United States made in 1845,&#xD;
omi three different cases, one from the State of&#xD;
Mass achusetts-..--prohibiting the sale of spirituous&#xD;
liquors in less quantities than twenty-eight gab&#xD;
Ions-one from New hampshire, and one from&#xD;
Rhode island, of a similar character."&#xD;
ITo here read the remarks of Chief Justice Ta-&#xD;
1C, as reported in S howard; p. 504.&#xD;
Every State may regulate its own internal&#xD;
traffic, according to its own judgment and upon&#xD;
its own. views of the interest and well being of its&#xD;
citizens. If any State deems the retail and inter-&#xD;
nal traffic in ardent spirits injurious to its citizens,&#xD;
and calculated to produce idleness, ruin and de-&#xD;
bauchery, I see nothing in the Constitution of the&#xD;
United States to prevent it from regulating gand&#xD;
restraining the traffic, or from prohibiting it alto-&#xD;
gether, if it thinks proper."&#xD;
"In these cases, the Chief Justice had the con-&#xD;

bench," continued Hamlin, "from the remarks of&#xD;
whom, with your indulgence, I will read."&#xD;
"I admit," says Judge Catron, "as inevitable,&#xD;
that if the State has the power of restraint by li~.&#xD;
cense to any extent, she has the discretionary&#xD;
power to Judge of its limits, and may go to the&#xD;
length of prohibiting sales altogether."&#xD;
Judge M'Lean holds the following:&#xD;
"Merchandise from a port where contagious&#xD;
disease prevails, being liable to communicate dis~&#xD;
case, may be excluded, and in certain cases may&#xD;
he thrown into the sea. This comes In direct con~&#xD;
hot with the regulations of commerce, and yet es~&#xD;
sential to preservation, and exists necessarily in&#xD;
every organized community. It is, indeed, the&#xD;
law of nature, and is possessed by man in his in-&#xD;
dividual capacity."&#xD;
~' Again," continued Jlamlin, "Judge Crier&#xD;
says:&#xD;
"Quarantine laws which protect public health,&#xD;
compel mere commercial regulations to submit to&#xD;
their control. They restrain the liberty of the&#xD;
passengers; they operate on the ship which is the&#xD;
instrument of commerce, and its officers and crew,&#xD;
the agents of navigation. They seize the infected&#xD;
cargo and cast it overboard. All these things are&#xD;
done, not from power which the State assumes to&#xD;
regulate or interfere with the regulations of Con~&#xD;
gross, but because the police laws for the preven-&#xD;
tion of crime ~nd the protection of the public&#xD;
&#xD;
welfare, must of necessity have full and free ope&#xD;
ration according to the exigency which requires&#xD;
their interference. If a loss of revenue should&#xD;
accrue to the United States from a diminished&#xD;
consumption of ardent spirits, she would be the&#xD;
gainer a thousand fold in the health and happi-&#xD;
ness of the city."'&#xD;
"WhilQ another of the Judges holds the fob&#xD;
lowing language," continued Hamlin:&#xD;
"It is not necessary to array the appalling sta-&#xD;
tistics of misery, pauperism, and crime, which have&#xD;
their origin in the use and abuse of ardent spirits.&#xD;
The police power, which is exclusively vested in&#xD;
the State, is alone competent to the correction of&#xD;
these great evils; and all measures of restraint or&#xD;
prohibition necessary to effect that purpose, are&#xD;
within the scope of that authority. All laws for&#xD;
the restraint or punishment of crime, or the pres-&#xD;
ervation of the public peace, health, or morals are&#xD;
from their very nature of primary iniportance and&#xD;
lie at the foundation of social existence. They are&#xD;
for the protection of life and liberty, and necessarily&#xD;
compel all laws on subjects of secondary impor-&#xD;
tance, which relate only to property, convenience,&#xD;
or luxury, to recede when they come in contact or&#xD;
collision.&#xD;
"The question, then," continued Hamlin, "has&#xD;
been adjudicated and settled affirmatively, by the&#xD;
highest judicial power of the land. If it was an&#xD;
open question, who could doubt how it must ne~&#xD;

cessarily be settled? The framers of the coflsti-&#xD;
tution never contemplated taking away from the&#xD;
citizen, the natural right of self preservation."&#xD;
As soon as Hamlin closed, a' young man from&#xD;
the Southwestern~ portion of the State, rose and&#xD;
talked flippantly, for some thirty minutes, about&#xD;
the immense amount of money his constituents had&#xD;
invested in the manufacture and traffic of spiritu-&#xD;
ous liquors, and wound up with an attempt at&#xD;
rhetorical flourish, in which he claimed, that there&#xD;
was, in the entire State, about ten millions of dol-&#xD;
lars invested in the business of manufacturing and&#xD;
vending alcoholic drinks, which would seek other&#xD;
investments, and for the-most part out of the State,&#xD;
in the event of the passage of the law.&#xD;
Tompkins now arose, amid the waving of hand-&#xD;
kerchiefs and deafening applause, which lasted for&#xD;
several minutes in spite of the efforts of the Pres-&#xD;
ident and officers of the Senate. Order being re-&#xD;
stored, he commenced by portraying&#xD;
"In eloqueiice that charms and burns,&#xD;
Startles, sooths, and wins by turns,"&#xD;
the inroads upon domestic happiness made by this&#xD;
great curse. After dwelling upon this branch of&#xD;
his subject for about forty minutes, during which&#xD;
eyes "unused to the melting mood" were seen to&#xD;
weep, he delineated its baleful effects upon social&#xD;
life, in a most graphic and masterly manner.&#xD;

lIe heaves the ponderous thought;&#xD;
Now pours the storm of eloquence&#xD;
With scathiiig Ii ghtning fraught."&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
&#xD;
He then, for sometime, discussed the effects of in-&#xD;
temperance upon the body politic in which he&#xD;
showed by startling facts and figures, that more&#xD;
than nineteen-twentieths of all the crime in the&#xD;
land was, caused, either directly or indirectly, by&#xD;
this vice-~that it peopled our alms-houses and our&#xD;
prisons, nursed litigation and engendered disease;&#xD;
and wound up by following the wretched inebriate&#xD;
to the regions of pandamoniurn, where the raven&#xD;
wing of despair flapped in betoken of the endless&#xD;
durability of his torment.&#xD;
"He ceased; and solemn silence now was broke&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
"It tells mc every cloud is past&#xD;
Which lately seemed to lower,&#xD;
That Hope bath wed young Joy at last,&#xD;
And now's their nuptial hour."&#xD;
The Bill having 'passed the Senate with but few&#xD;
dissenting voices, was now sent to the Hall of the&#xD;
House of Representatives where, it was hoped by&#xD;
the enemies of the measure, it would be defeated.&#xD;
At the commencement of the session of the Leg-&#xD;
islature, the bill had but few friends in the lower&#xD;
House, yet those were among the most active and&#xD;
influential members of the body&#xD;
The supporters of the "Maine Law" were quite&#xD;
sanguine of ultimate success, but dreaded imme-&#xD;
diate action, while the opposes of the measure&#xD;
were resorting to every artifice that ingenuity could&#xD;
invent to bring the matter to an issue. The daily&#xD;
and hourly accessions to the "Maine Law" force,&#xD;
induced them to regard delay as fraught with imi-&#xD;
iient danger.&#xD;
In the meantime, the aid of Barnum, Cary, Jew-&#xD;
ett, and other patriarchs in the cause of temper-&#xD;
~nce, was invoked and their presence hourly ex-&#xD;
pected9&#xD;
&#xD;
While our temperance friends, prompted by the&#xD;
I)Cst feelings of our nature, with a patriotism and&#xD;
love of their race, that would have done honor to&#xD;
the sages and soldiers of our memorable revolu-&#xD;
tionary struggle, were encompassing sea and land&#xD;
fbr the purpose of procuring the passage of this&#xD;
philanthropic measure, the whiskey influence was&#xD;
by no means inactive. The emissaries of the traP&#xD;
tic were hovering around, a~ numerous as the frogs&#xD;
of Egypt, with neither the disposition nor ability&#xD;
to meet the question fairly, and manfully discuss&#xD;
its merits, but were as near omnipresent as finite&#xD;
creatures could be. Now, decoying by some petty&#xD;
artifice, a member of the House into a saloon, or&#xD;
drinking establishment-then indulging in vulgar&#xD;
witticisms at the expense of men as far their supe-&#xD;
riors in every thing that enters into our estimate&#xD;
of a great and good man, as virtue is above vice.&#xD;
The ladies now determined to give the friends&#xD;
and supporters of the "Maine Law" a free sup-&#xD;
per. Conscious that many of the members of the&#xD;
house could not be reached through either head&#xD;
or heart, resolved to try the living argument; and&#xD;
bence they were invited to be present and partake&#xD;
of this sumptuous repast.&#xD;
in the preparation for this festive occasion, nei-&#xD;
ther pains nor expense was spared to make it a&#xD;
most brilliant and magnificent affair. Instrumen-&#xD;
t~d and vocal music were secured, and everything&#xD;

done to m~ake the occasion fascinating and en~&#xD;

The evening at length arrived. The largest hall&#xD;
in the city had been procured, and was now&#xD;
crowded to its utmost capacity.&#xD;
"The glad circle roupd them yield their souls&#xD;
To festive mirth and wit that knows no gall."&#xD;
Speeches were the order of the day, or rather of&#xD;
the night. Judge Jones was called for, and re-&#xD;
sponded in thrilling eloquence, for about ten min-&#xD;
utes; then Leblond, Barber, Jewett, Tompkins,&#xD;
and Hamhin, each in his turn, held that vast as-&#xD;
sembly spellbound with "thoughts that breathe&#xD;
and words that burn."&#xD;
Judge Jones now stepped upon the table and&#xD;
remarked, in a deep-toned voice, heard distinctly&#xD;
in the most remote corner of the hall, that he&#xD;
wished to make pro fert to members of the house,&#xD;
of some of the trophies of the demon alcohol,&#xD;
which he had procured at considerable trouble and&#xD;
expense, to grace this occasion; and hoped they&#xD;
would come forward and occupy a position in&#xD;
front of the table, upon which he stood. The&#xD;
members were soon before him, as requested; when&#xD;
he caused, by previous concert, suddenly a sliding&#xD;
door to be thrown open, which exposed to the gap~&#xD;
ing vi~w of the astonished and awe-stricken leg~&#xD;
islators, about thirty women and children robed&#xD;
in the habihirnents of the deepest mourning.&#xD;
&#xD;
"These, my countrymen," exclaimed Jones,&#xD;
"are some of the trophies of this unrelenting de-&#xD;
stroyer. Behold the aged mother of Lahm! crush-&#xD;

"We will, we xviii !" exclaimed fifty voices or&#xD;
more.&#xD;
Leblond, from his intuitive knowledge of the&#xD;
human heart, saw that this was the propitious mo-&#xD;
ment, sprang upon the table, and amid sighs and&#xD;
sobs adjourned the meeting, when the people slowly&#xD;
* disappeared.&#xD;
A council of the sachems was privately called.&#xD;
immediately after the meeting dispersed; and&#xD;
upon consultation and deliberation, it was thought&#xD;
advisable to force the Bill through at the earliest&#xD;
possible moment. Accordingly on the following&#xD;
morning the Bill was called up, and. to the amaze-&#xD;
ment of the friends as well as the enemies ot thc&#xD;
measure, four or five of the most prominent oppo-&#xD;
sers of the Maine Law, had, during the previous&#xD;
evening, enlisted for the war under the "Main&amp;amp;&#xD;
banner, and were now like the prancing war steeQ&#xD;
impatient for the coming conflict. Nor were they&#xD;
long in suspense.&#xD;
A frothy young limb of the law, from that region&#xD;
of the State where distilleries were numerous and&#xD;
corn in abundance, rose and said, that many milh&#xD;
ions of money were invested in the State, in thr&#xD;
manufacture and sale of liquors, nearly all of&#xD;
which would be an entire loss if the bill passed;&#xD;
and that which might be saved from the wreck&#xD;
would seek investment in sister States-that corn&#xD;
&#xD;
and rye, which were now commanding a highprice&#xD;
in consequence of the-~ immense amounts used in&#xD;
distilling liquors, would become a drug in our mar-&#xD;
kets-that the reduction in the prices of these pro-&#xD;
ducts of the farm would very materially affect the&#xD;
agricultural interests, and lessen essentially the&#xD;
value of the productive lands of the State; and&#xD;
closed With an over wrought declamation, in which&#xD;
he asserted that the ~emperance advocates in their&#xD;
zeal) closed their eyes upon facts, and trampled&#xD;
upon the rights of their fellow citizens.&#xD;
The member. who now obtained the floor was&#xD;
one of the recent converts. Tie maintained in all&#xD;
the zeal of new born faith, that there was not one&#xD;
half the amount invested in the manufacture and&#xD;
traffic which the gentleman claimed; but insisted&#xD;
if there were fifty millions, instead of five, it&#xD;
would be infinitely better for the State, for society,&#xD;
for religion, for education, for everything that&#xD;
characterized and distinguished civilization and&#xD;
refinement from barbarism and heathenish dark-&#xD;
ness; that a mill-stone be hanged about its neck,&#xD;
and it cast into the uttermost depths of the ocean,&#xD;
than that it should be permitted to remain among&#xD;
us, infecting society with vice, with indolence, and&#xD;
with crime.&#xD;
He argued that the money now invested in&#xD;
manufacturing this fearful instrument of misery,&#xD;
wretchedness and death, would readily and with&#xD;
great facility, in this active, moving, restles.~ ago&#xD;

of invention, seek investment in other channekr,&#xD;
from which would flow blessings instead of curses,&#xD;
upon society. That the thousands now made&#xD;
drunken debauchees, and hence weights upon the&#xD;
body politic, would be saved by this measure;&#xD;
would become sober, industrious men, and their&#xD;
energies would be spent in felling our forests and&#xD;
draining our lands; in constructing internal im-&#xD;
provements and enhancing the wealth of the&#xD;
country.&#xD;
"Could the gentleman," continued the speaker,&#xD;
"visit one of our large cities and there witness,&#xD;
~as I have, in its two or three thousand liquor gro-&#xD;
ceries, the pernicious facilities furnished to thou-&#xD;
sands of husbands, wives and children, who but&#xD;
for these sinks of iniquity might never have&#xD;
been tempted, and might have been, many of&#xD;
them, among our most useful citizens: and there&#xD;

these dens of degradation, their last dime; when.&#xD;
their money is gone, then pawn the furniture of&#xD;
the house, article by article, until not even the&#xD;
beds upon which the family slept are left, and then&#xD;
carry their own and the clothing of their children,&#xD;
and pledge them for whiskey; would he not re-&#xD;

after seeing them, he could, in this noon of the&#xD;
nineteenth century, amid a blaze of moral light&#xD;
that is flashing in every direction, stand erect in&#xD;
this legislative body and vote in favor of 'the per-&#xD;

He closed by adding:&#xD;
Heaven and earth will witness,&#xD;

Now another of the champions of alcohol rose,&#xD;
and assumed the position, that to pass the Bill&#xD;
would be an invasion of the rights of the citizen.&#xD;
Claimed that in a state of nature man had a&#xD;
right to eat, drink, wear, and in short, do what he&#xD;
pleased. That the passage of the "Maine Law"&#xD;
would be an infraction of one of those rights;&#xD;
that citizens would not submit to an invasion of&#xD;
their rights. That the time was not far distant,&#xD;
if the Bill under consideration passed, when men&#xD;
would undertake to restrict us as to the quality&#xD;
and quantity of food we should eat; and perhaps&#xD;
claim the right to say what we should, and what&#xD;
we should not, wear.&#xD;
This speaker was very brief, and evidently&#xD;
spoke against the convictions of head and heart.&#xD;

the floorand for about twohours, discussed the sub-&#xD;
ject. Heclaimedthe last gentleman hadbeen most&#xD;
signally unfortunate, when he urged as a reason&#xD;
for the defeat of the Bill, that citizens would soon&#xD;
be in danger of having their kitchen and dining&#xD;
room arrangements interfered with. lie insisted&#xD;
that when the general good of the whole demands&#xD;
the sacrifice, the police and municipal law would&#xD;
cut off any article of food, and without reference&#xD;
to the value or the amount of money invested in&#xD;
it. That when an epidemic or infectious disease&#xD;
prevails in a city or town, any and all articles of&#xD;
food, which are supposed to lend 'facilities to the&#xD;
spread of the epidemic or infection, may be by&#xD;
police and municipal regulations immediately de~&#xD;
dared contraband gpods, however epicures-&#xD;
the less thoughtless and more reckless portion of&#xD;
the community, might rave. That the inherent&#xD;
power existed in society to protect itself against&#xD;
harm, whatever shape the wrong might assume.&#xD;
That no intelligent gentleman, much less an able&#xD;
jurist, would controvert the position that this was&#xD;
one of the rights which could not be taken from&#xD;
the citizens.&#xD;
"What," exclaimed he, "would be thought of the&#xD;
sanity of the individual whose house is broken&#xD;
and entered by the midnight btirglar, who should&#xD;
not immediately rise and defend\ his domicil and&#xD;
its inmates; but would await redress by the slow&#xD;
process ot the law. Would not the slaughter of&#xD;
&#xD;
himself and family often follow in the wake of&#xD;
this kind of philosophy? Does not necessity oc-&#xD;
casionally require in conflagrations, the blowing&#xD;
up and pulling down of whole blocks of buildings,&#xD;
for the purpose of saving a city? while those en-&#xD;
gaged in the work never stop to enquirer as to the&#xD;
right, nor has the. right ever been questioned.&#xD;
Nec~s~ity would impel the father and husband&#xD;
~o repel the burglar by violence, for the safety of&#xD;
his property, his wife and children. And aM like&#xD;
necessity imperiously demands the destruction of&#xD;
large arno unts of property in case of fire, in order&#xD;
that still greater amounts m~y be saved.&#xD;
"If then," continued he, "necessity is above&#xD;
all law, and individual c ens can avail them- ~&#xD;
selves of this necessity for the purpose of saving&#xD;
themselves and their property, might it not vvith&#xD;
much show of reason, be argued that individuals&#xD;
have a right upon the same principle to sieze spi-&#xD;
rituous liquor wherever and whenever found, and&#xD;
indiscriminately destroy it? He would not insult&#xD;
that body by attempting to prove the use as well&#xD;
as abuse of ardent spirits, a great evil, as that&#xD;
would be impeaching their intelligence~ and good&#xD;
sense."&#xD;
lIe argued at great length, that society was or~&#xD;
ganized for mutual protection and defence. That&#xD;
if society possessed not the innate right to protect&#xD;
itself, then the great object and aim of its forma-&#xD;
tion had not been attained. But it was conceded&#xD;

that a ch~munity had a right without regard to&#xD;
law, to repel an invasion, arrest an infection, or&#xD;
stop a destructive fire, at the cost of the sacrifice&#xD;
of private property; and yet strange as it might&#xD;
appear, men respectable in point of intellect, and&#xD;
having some claims 1o morality, would stand in&#xD;
their places upon that floor, and insist that the&#xD;
passage of tho IBill would be an invasion of the&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
And lead us not into temptation&#xD;
Bat deliver us from cvil.~Lord's Prayer.&#xD;
"Ma, ma," said a sprightly girl, about seven&#xD;
years of age, as she came bounding into her&#xD;
mother's room, her cheeks glowing like the ruby&#xD;
and her eyes flashing like beautiful gems, while&#xD;
she was clapping her hands in transports of j oy;&#xD;
"Pa, can't get any liquor, pa can't, he can't: I&#xD;
saw him try many places; he can't get it, I know&#xD;
he can't. Oh! wont we now be happy, ma&#xD;
Wont we soon have shoes and good new clothes,&#xD;
like Doctor Baker's little children ?"&#xD;
Her mother now raised her eyes slowly from&#xD;
her work for she was plying the needle with all&#xD;
the energy which want impels, and coolly re-&#xD;
marked; "my daughter, aint you mistaken ?"&#xD;
"No, indeed, ma! I saw him go down to Jake&#xD;
Infamy's grocery, and as he passed along, I&#xD;
heard one gentleman ~say to another, 'will Jake&#xD;
Infamy give that man liquor? If he do, he&#xD;
ought to be attended to promptly, and put&#xD;
through."&#xD;
"And then I quietly followed him; and when he&#xD;
went into the grocery, I went Just inside of the&#xD;
&#xD;
door ~and set down behind a barrel of fish,&#xD;
where neither pa nor Jake could see me. Pa.&#xD;
asked fur whiskey, but the grocery keeper told&#xD;
him he had none. Then pa said, 'I know you&#xD;
have plenty of it; you had several barrels last&#xD;
night, and he must have some; that he ha&amp;amp;-been&#xD;
a little high yesterday, and wanted some on which&#xD;
to taper off."'&#xD;
But Jake said he couldn't let him have any-&#xD;
not a drop.&#xD;
"Then pa said, 'why? hadn't I always paid&#xD;
you-and here is the money.~~&#xD;
"Then pa threw down on the counter three&#xD;
cents, but Jake said he shouldn't have any; that&#xD;
the Maine Law went into force yesterday; and&#xD;
that the Maine Law men were watching him, and&#xD;
would sue him and break him up, if he sold any.&#xD;
Pa then asked Jake to give him one dram, but&#xD;
Jake said he dare not give it away; that was just&#xD;
as bad; that they would sue him quite as soon for&#xD;
that as if he sold it.&#xD;
"Oh! ma," said the child, "that Jake is a wicked&#xD;
man," as she approached her mother more closely,&#xD;
and in a half whisper, said, "he did swear such&#xD;
big oaths at the Maine Law."&#xD;
"Well, my dear," said the mother, "it is the&#xD;

uight, and come home, I fear, quite as di:unk as&#xD;

"No, no," quickly retorted the little girl; "ma,&#xD;
he can't get any; he went to all the groceries in&#xD;
the village, and as I saw him go into the last one,&#xD;
I slipped in between some boxes near the door,&#xD;
and heard the grocery man tell him they had no&#xD;
liquor there; but pa wanted some so bad, and the&#xD;
nasty man said he vvould'nt give him a glass if it&#xD;
would save his life. Was'nt that mean, ma? only&#xD;
think of it, wouldn't give pa a glass to save his&#xD;
life, and then, ma, you never heard how the grocery&#xD;
man did swear and curse the Maine Law. Who&#xD;
is the Maine Law, ma? He must be some very&#xD;
good man, these wicked grocery keepers all hate&#xD;
him so."&#xD;
"It is not a man, my dear child, but a law."&#xD;
"What is a law, ma? It must be a good law.&#xD;
Didn't God make it ma&#xD;
"No dear God did not make the Maine Law;&#xD;
but good men who love God, and their fellow men,&#xD;
made the law to prevent men from getting drunk,&#xD;
and spending for liquor the money they ought to&#xD;
spend for food and clothing for their families."&#xD;
"Ma," said the little girl, pa will never get&#xD;
drunk any more, and come home and be cross and&#xD;
abuse us! He will save his money now, and he&#xD;
will buy us a house, wont he, ma? Ma, maint I&#xD;
then plant a honey-suckle, ajessamine and a rose,&#xD;
like Hetty Smith's? don't they look sweet, ma&#xD;
&#xD;
while she danced around the room in a delirium&#xD;
of childish ~glee. Could every father wedded to&#xD;
his cups, or in danger of becoming so, realize for&#xD;
a moment the pleasure that filled that infant&#xD;
breast at the thought of having a temperate&#xD;
father-a home where the tender hand could train&#xD;
and rear the plant-watch its budding and bloom-&#xD;
ing into emblematic purity, would he not be less&#xD;
than parental, if he did not stop, shake off the&#xD;
habit, with however much inveteracy it may have&#xD;
fastened itself upon him?&#xD;
"Tom," said a half clad, sturdy loafer, as he&#xD;
came rather hastily into a grocery, some months&#xD;
previously his familiar haunt, "give us a dram,"&#xD;
as he threw down three cents, the price of whis-&#xD;
key sufficient to make a fool of him, and fit him&#xD;
for the commission of crime of any grade.&#xD;
"We don't sell here," gruffly responded Tom,&#xD;

will climb over the counter and break your con-&#xD;

"Why," exclaimed George, "what the devil is&#xD;
tlie matter with you, I never saw you so before?'&#xD;
"Well," said Tom, "I'm not in a very good&#xD;
humor, and don't like to be insulted."&#xD;
"I did not intend to insult you, and never knew&#xD;
before it was any harm to come in and ask for a&#xD;
glass of liquor. It never before insulted you."&#xD;
No, nor it wouldn't now," said Tom, "if it&#xD;
wasn't for this infernal Maine Law, that these&#xD;
cursed, hypocritical fanatics and saintly fools,&#xD;
have been passing."&#xD;
"Maine Law," said George, "what do you&#xD;
mean ?"&#xD;
"What I say, to be sure," grunted Tom.&#xD;
"Do tell me; when was that passed," inquired&#xD;
George.&#xD;
Tom, still indoubt whether George was in good&#xD;
faith or attempting to annoy him over his misfor-&#xD;
tune in the liquor traffic, enquired of George where&#xD;
he had been for the last six months.&#xD;
It now became George's turn to lose his balance,&#xD;
and rave a little, supposing Tom had, from the be-&#xD;
ginning, been practif5ing a hoax upon him, said-&#xD;
"It is true I have been in the work-house for the&#xD;
last six month~, but I am as good a man as you.&#xD;
I was sent there for getting drunk upon your liquor&#xD;
~-whiskey, got from you, Sir! While I was in&#xD;
prison, shut in. from the world-associated with&#xD;
&#xD;
villains and cut-throats-living on the convict's&#xD;
stinted and miserable rations, and sleeping on a&#xD;
pallet of straw-familiar with creaking grates,&#xD;
iron bolts, clanking, chains, a~'id the overseer's lash,&#xD;
-you, sir, were happy with your family, enjoying&#xD;
your liberty; while, through the influence of the&#xD;
money you have obtained by robbing myself, and&#xD;
other poor, unfortunate fellows, you have become&#xD;
the little end of 'upper-tendum' whittled down;&#xD;
and, if you don't believe it, just come over that&#xD;
counter if you dare, and I'll tramp you, you coward-&#xD;
ly puppy. You have desolated the home of my wife&#xD;
and children-you have made me a miserable, de-&#xD;
graded convict; and now you will add insult to&#xD;
injury ! "-while he beat the air with his l)onderous,&#xD;
great, clenched fist, as near the face of Tom as he&#xD;
could get it for the counter.&#xD;
The truth in the premises, now flashed upon&#xD;
the mind of Tom. He discovered that George had&#xD;
been in prison for six months, and during that pe-&#xD;
riod the Maine Law had been passed, and the&#xD;
liquor traffic had beep stopped; but George, just&#xD;
out of prison, had not, as yet, learned the fact-&#xD;
Tom, therefore, attempted to explain the difficulty&#xD;
thus:&#xD;
"George," said he," there is no occasion for un-&#xD;
kind feeling between you and myself-none in the&#xD;
least. You supposed I was intending to make&#xD;
sport of you, while I was quite certain you knew&#xD;
all about this cursed Maine Law, which I have no&#xD;

&#xD;
doubt John Bunyan made about the same time he&#xD;
made the Pilgrim's Progress~, and was trifling alike&#xD;
with my feelings and misfortunes. I am now sat~&#xD;
isfied we were both mistaken. I did not know you&#xD;
had been in prison."&#xD;
"All right!" exclaimed George, as he took Tom&#xD;
by the hand and said, "I want a little, if you have&#xD;
a drop about the establishment?"&#xD;
"I have not a drop, nor the hundredth part of&#xD;
a drop, nor have I a vessel or cask about my store&#xD;
from which you could smell your old friend, and&#xD;
d-d sorry am I, too, for it."&#xD;
"Well," said George, "You can tell me, I sup-&#xD;
pose, where I can get the worth of these three&#xD;
cents?" rattling them in the face of Tom. "I&#xD;
have had these three cents six months and a few&#xD;
hours. They happened to be in my pocket at the&#xD;
time I was sent to the work-house. You would&#xD;
have had them, Tom, long since, if the scamps up&#xD;
there had let me come down town to see you."&#xD;
"You will not be able to get one drop in the&#xD;
city," somewhat petulantly replied Tom.&#xD;
"Well, I will ;" was the quick response of George&#xD;
Summers.&#xD;
He immediately started; and, from grocery to&#xD;
grocery, and from store to store went George, un-&#xD;
til he had passed over the entire city; and finally&#xD;
returned to Tom's establishment, and pulled from his&#xD;
head that which bore some slight evidence of hav-&#xD;

ter-~--wiped off the sweat from his his face with the&#xD;
sleeve of his old coat, and exclaimed," Well, Tom;&#xD;
this is a terrible state of things! the devil will&#xD;
certainly get all those fanatics! If those that he&#xD;
has got could only come back, occasionally, a few&#xD;
of them would soon teach those here to mind their&#xD;
own business; then we could get a glass when we&#xD;
wished it. Well, now Tom, I dont like to walk&#xD;
out home five miles, without a horn. I could stand&#xD;
it, but then I have had none for six months, and&#xD;
that is most too long between drains; I can get it&#xD;
out where I live in some of the groceries as soon&#xD;
as I reach home, that is certain.&#xD;
"It is very certain you will be unable to get the&#xD;
article anywhere," again gruffly rejoined Tom.&#xD;
George Summers started for the village in which&#xD;
his family lived; and though he had not seen nor&#xD;
heard from them, nor any of them, since his incar-&#xD;
ceration, he went not directly to his home, but to&#xD;
a grocery where he had been accustomed to get&#xD;
liquor at his pleasure, but found none-from thence&#xD;
he went to every grocery and store in the village&#xD;
with a like result.&#xD;
"Well," said George Summers; "things aint as&#xD;
they used to was, that am sartin; but I know&#xD;
bravely where I can get some. Old Ben Burns&#xD;
keeps the article. This devilish fanaticism can't&#xD;
possibly have reached the still-house of that old&#xD;
saint. It is some distance up there-let me see,&#xD;
about six miles-can you stand that, George, be-&#xD;

&#xD;
fore you see the babies? It is pretty hard, yet it&#xD;
is harder to do without the liquor; so here we go."&#xD;
And away started George Summers to old Ben-&#xD;
jamin Burn's distillery, but when he reached the&#xD;
spot where strife, contention, debauchery and crime.&#xD;
from its lightest to its darkest shades-where dig-&#xD;
ease, death, and damnation, had, for nearly a half&#xD;
century, been manufactured-4o his great disap-&#xD;
pointment, and chagrin, he found the fire had been&#xD;
put out by this messenger from the throne of the&#xD;
Eternal, the-~--Maine Law-which had for many&#xD;
long years heated the worm that has for ages upon&#xD;
ages thrown its fatal coils around fallen hum~nity.&#xD;
George Summers stretched himself up-took off&#xD;
his old cap-wiped with the sleeve of his old coat.&#xD;
the respiration that was oozing from every pour&#xD;
of his face-while he ran his fingers through the&#xD;
disheveled hair that hung over a high and massive&#xD;
four-head, patting the ground with his left foot he&#xD;
was heard to say, "Well, this is truly a new order&#xD;
of things, no whiskey in the city, no whiskey in&#xD;
the village, no whiskey in the country. Even old&#xD;
Vesuvius, has ceased to voinet forth its blessings&#xD;
upon the poor as well as the rich man. It is now&#xD;
vacated-inhabited alone by the bat and night-&#xD;
hawk. I would prefer the work-house at once to&#xD;
such liberty. But I'll go and see John Taite, Pete&#xD;
Craft, and Jake Rex, and know what account they&#xD;
have of matters and things. I guess, if they can&#xD;
live without, I can." And accordingly away he&#xD;

'~ how the old Harry do you get along these tunes.&#xD;

Very well," replied John Tait.&#xD;
"Very well, eb!" rejoined George Summers, "thc~&#xD;

you. I would not give two figs for as much of this&#xD;
kind of liberty as you could write in fifty declara-&#xD;

if these 01(1 blue-stockings-these ~natical Puri-~&#xD;

we shall eat and what we shall drink."&#xD;
~'No," said Tait, "you can eat what you choose.&#xD;
and drink what you please, provided you let that&#xD;
drink alone which makes at fool of you-injures.&#xD;
most sadly, yourself and family, and not unfre-~&#xD;

~'Can it be possible," exclaimed George, "that&#xD;

"Yes," said Tait, "if you arc in favor of&#xD;
drinking, then they are aif against you. George,&#xD;
you couldn't get Pete, or Jake, or any of them, to&#xD;
drink a drain for a kingdom."&#xD;
"P11 bet my cap, old Vulcan," said George, "any&#xD;
of them, or even yourself, could be bought with a&#xD;
very small kingdom-not bigger than my p otatoc&#xD;
patch."&#xD;
Why," said Tait, " they are all industrious&#xD;
men, comfortably living and handsomely sustain-&#xD;
ing themselves and their families, sober at iir~t&#xD;
from necessity, but afterwards from choice; now&#xD;
educating their children and living like men, and&#xD;
not like brutes."&#xD;
Well," said George Summers, as he drew his&#xD;
left hand two or three times over his face and&#xD;
eyes, "I believe P11 go home and see how things&#xD;
look there."&#xD;
" I would exhort you," said Tait, "to let liquor&#xD;
alone, if I did not know you couldn't get any, and&#xD;
therefore you must keep sober, for the same rea~&#xD;
son that myself and others did. After a time you&#xD;
could not be persuaded, nor even driven back, to&#xD;
your cups."&#xD;
"Wife, how do you do?" said George Suinmer~,&#xD;
as he entered the door of his former home.&#xD;
"Why," George Summers," exclaimed his wife,&#xD;
"by what accident is it you are sober ?" while&#xD;
she seemed to say through every feature of her&#xD;
face, "my good fellow you are done drinking, so&#xD;
&#xD;
~ong as you live in this land of wholesome laws."&#xD;
George understood her quizzical glances, and&#xD;
~~eplied, "not by accident, Madam, I thank you-&#xD;
but from 'sheer necessityy"&#xD;
George Summers was a first class mechanist,&#xD;
as soon as the question was settled that lie&#xD;
~ould have no more liquor to use as a beverage,&#xD;
he immediately applied for, and procured, a situ-&#xD;
~tion at~good. wages, in an extensive machine&#xD;
~hop of the village in which he resided; where&#xD;
ho continued to work for some six or seven weeks,&#xD;
when in consequence Oi breakage, George was&#xD;
~for several days out of employ, and therefore re-&#xD;
turned home.&#xD;
While playing with his boy upon the carpet,&#xD;
(for carpet as well as many other luxuries they had&#xD;
procured soon after George became temperate,)&#xD;
he con'anence(l laughing outright, and ~o immode-&#xD;
rately as to attract the attention of Mrs. Sum-&#xD;
mers, who inquired what it mcant.&#xD;
"I was thinking," exclaimed George Summers,&#xD;
"if I were to put on that splendid suit of black&#xD;
~nd walk up into the city, as sober as a judge&#xD;
ought to be, what a sensation I would produce.-&#xD;
~t would make the Governor and Warden of the&#xD;

George rose from the floor, put on his Sunday&#xD;
regalia, and started for the city; soon after he&#xD;
reached which, he was passing the Governor of&#xD;
the State, who, in conversation with some gentle-&#xD;

man, remarked that he had it in his power at on~&#xD;
time just previous to the passage of the Maine&#xD;
Law, to defeat the Bill, and he regretted that he&#xD;
had not slaughtered the thing.&#xD;
It sounded upon the ear of George Suinmcr~&#xD;
like a voice from the haunts of crime and foB~~&#xD;
nai~ery and woe ; and with the swift lunged spe~i~&#xD;
of thought, he reviewed his life previous to tb~&#xD;
passage of the law, and contrasted it with il~~t&#xD;
portion spent in the discharge of duty and th~&#xD;
service of virtuc ; while he fixed his large, pier -&#xD;
cing' black eyes upon the Governor, and exclaimed,&#xD;
"I'll pay your excellence 'that money very soon.&#xD;
What money ?" inquired the Governor.&#xD;
Wh)r, the price and cost of divers and' sundry&#xD;
articles, too tedious to mention."&#xD;
You talk in enigmas, George, entirely beyond&#xD;

less beyond the value of rubies, the conscmousne~&#xD;
that I'm a man, and my reason is constantly on&#xD;
her throne, while I am not liable to do wrong t~&#xD;
myself or others."&#xD;
The Governor looked at George Suinumers foe&#xD;
~everaI consecutive minutes, lost in the thick iaby-&#xD;
&#xD;
rlntlis of thought, without uttering a syllable, but&#xD;
finally broke the ominous silence by exclaiming&#xD;
to his friend in a loud and excited tone of voice,&#xD;
accompanied with energetic and violent gesticula-&#xD;
tions, " Such a salvation is of more value than all&#xD;
the inconveniences that could grow out of enact-&#xD;
'~'~g and enforcing this law. One such change in~&#xD;
finitely over-balances and outweighs all devils and&#xD;
objections that could be interposed by the most&#xD;
e~ptiomis. With such evidence of its salutary&#xD;
effect, I would not at this moment for my right&#xD;
arm, have defeated the Bill."&#xD;
if statesmen, and men in elevated positions in&#xD;
life, could lose sight of party incentives, party&#xD;
trammels and party hindrances, and could realize&#xD;

Some weeks after the Maine Law had been&#xD;
enacted and gone into force, Judge Jones, chanced&#xD;
to be stopping in a village over night, in a remote&#xD;
part of the State, where two somewhat extensive&#xD;
liquor dealers had been boasting of their intention&#xD;
to disregard the enactment, and avowed their de-&#xD;
termination, to hurl defiance in the very teeth of&#xD;
the law. Of these facts, Judge Jones, during the&#xD;
evening became acquainted, and had an interview&#xD;
on the following morning, with the officer charged&#xD;
with enforcing the enactment; after obtaining&#xD;
which, he said: "Sir, procure your process and&#xD;
authorize me to accompany you in the discharge&#xD;
of your official duty, and you have my word for it,&#xD;
that before the expiration of three hours those&#xD;
liquor stores will be emptied of their contents."&#xD;

"But," said the officer, "one of these men is a&#xD;
desperado, and will shoot! Some person will be&#xD;
killed."&#xD;
"Lie is not insane, I imagine?" very coolly re&#xD;
plied Jones.&#xD;
"No," said the officer, "but he is notorious for&#xD;
his physical power and malicious heart."&#xD;
"Evince a disposition to enforce this matter," said&#xD;
Jones, "and he will quail before the superior pow~&#xD;
er and majesty of the law."&#xD;
"But he don't know what fear is, and is a~&#xD;
courageous as a tiger."&#xD;
"Well, well," said Judge J6nes, do as I direct,&#xD;
and he will soon know how to submit-will soon&#xD;
rival the pet kitten in docility.~7&#xD;
The officer, accordingly, procured his papers and&#xD;
summoned the Judge to his aid, and was about in~&#xD;
creasing his posse, when Judge Jones protested,&#xD;
saying, "We are equal to this work. Make more&#xD;
show of the power and majesty of the law, and&#xD;
less display of physical force, and you will be much&#xD;
less liable to be met and ~repel-led with brute force.'&#xD;
Jones and the officer immediately repaired to the&#xD;
liquor establishment of the man whom the officer&#xD;
most dreaded, and found him standing upon the&#xD;
threshold of his rum-shop, armed to the teeth, hax.&#xD;
ing been previously notifiedby some of his satellites,&#xD;
of his impending danger; swearing vengeance&#xD;
and death to the first man who should attempt to&#xD;
invade his rights.&#xD;

Judge Jones stepped up to him, and thug ad-&#xD;
dressed him: "Sir, we have come here clothed&#xD;
with the power of the law, and resistance is folly.&#xD;
We are unarmed-have nothing, save the strong&#xD;
arm of the lavv; but, should you resist, you will&#xD;
realize, to your sorrow, that it is more than a Da-&#xD;
~nascus blade." After saying which, with firmness,&#xD;
resolution, and courage beaming from every line-&#xD;
ament of his face, he deliberately walked up to Mr.&#xD;
Mars, acting upon the motto, "that to falter was&#xD;
to fail," and passed between him and the door&#xD;
post, into the store-took up a small cask, the first&#xD;
he came to, and threw it into the street, without&#xD;
being very 1)articfllar whether or not it came in&#xD;
contact with its courageous owner; and by the&#xD;
lime Jones had another in readiness to, hurl into&#xD;
the street, its late owner, now interested in the&#xD;
safety of his lower extremities, gave way, and the&#xD;
door was entered by the officer; who, with two or&#xD;
three others that had came to their assistance,&#xD;
goon roiled over two hundred casks of the "dear&#xD;
critter' into the street, from whence it was carried&#xD;
to a place of deposit prepared for the purpose;&#xD;
and, in due time, condemned and emptied. into it~&#xD;

tinguished champions of the measure, were simi-&#xD;
lady engaged in other portions of the State.&#xD;
Some few months after the law went into force,&#xD;
Jones, Leblond, Jewett, and Tompkins, met to&#xD;
compare notes-all anxious that the operation of&#xD;
the law should not disappoint the hopes of the&#xD;
friends of this great measure.&#xD;
"Jones," said Leblond, after having been wrapi&#xD;
in thought; and, for many minutes, apparently&#xD;
unconscious of the presence of his friends, "1 have&#xD;
just been contrasting this interview with the one&#xD;
we had at the city, some months since, when I&#xD;
ordered the oysters, as you Vvill recollect."&#xD;
"These disgraceful occurrences have ceased to&#xD;
have a place in my memory. II seldom permit my&#xD;
mind to recur to them; and iiever, except to stimu-&#xD;
late nie to deeds of more noble daring," replied the&#xD;
Judge.&#xD;
"What a fearful, and most terrible account will&#xD;
the bar have to render at the great day of reck-&#xD;
fling," said Jewett.&#xD;
"Won't politicians have a still greater?" said&#xD;
Tompkins.&#xD;
"But," replied Leblond, "all lawyers are politi-&#xD;
cians. You can scarcely find a lawyer in the State&#xD;
who is not quite as much of a politician as lawyer;&#xD;
and wields, if not elsewhere, in his particular local-&#xD;
ity, no little 'influence."&#xD;
"Yes," ssld Juxlge Jones, "if the united bar of&#xD;
the country would give their undivided support to&#xD;
&#xD;
it, an entirely prohibitory enactment, embodying&#xD;
the spirit and principles of the Maine Law, would&#xD;
grace the the statute books of every State of this&#xD;
vast confederacy before twelve moons would wax&#xD;
and wane."&#xD;
"That's as true as revelation," said Jewett.~-~&#xD;
"No body of men in society exert the influence-.&#xD;
indeed, all other classes combined, if you except the&#xD;
press, are incapable of exerting the same amount&#xD;
of 'influence in the enactment and enforce ruent of&#xD;
laws, that the combined effort of the bar can put&#xD;
forth."&#xD;
"Well, gentlemen," remarked Tompkins, " now&#xD;
to the object of this meeting. How does the law&#xD;
opeilate so far as you have been able to judge from&#xD;
a transit through the State?"&#xD;
Gloriously, most gloriously!" said Judge Jones.&#xD;
In the small city of D., numbering a population of&#xD;
about twenty-five thousand, I was informed by his&#xD;
Honors the Mayor, that at the 'time the law took&#xD;
effect there were in full operation, at least three&#xD;
hu ridred groceries-at this m oinent, gentlemen,&#xD;
there is not one. These groceries would average&#xD;
from the sale of liquor at least two dollars and iff-&#xD;
ty cents per day, and that is moderate-less would&#xD;
make the traffic unprofitable-and we have the&#xD;
sum of two hundred and seventy-three thousand,&#xD;
seven hundred and fifty dollars. This may appear&#xD;
rather startling, but it is the computation of his&#xD;
Honor, the Mayor; a very intelligent and candid&#xD;

man. Now, when we contemplate the fact, that&#xD;
we have diverted an annual expenditure of over&#xD;
~ quarter of a million of dollars in a city of only&#xD;
twenty-five thousand; and, that instead of its run-&#xD;
ning down the throats of bad men making them&#xD;
worse-a complete lqss-it is now expended in*&#xD;
food, clothing, and education, for destitute families;&#xD;
while their hearts and heads are better cared for.&#xD;
if this was an isolated instance in our State, we,&#xD;
gentlemen, would be more than compensated for&#xD;
all the sacrifices we have made. But, in large&#xD;
cities and small towns the ett~ct is proportionate;&#xD;
and hence, who can compute its blessings upon the&#xD;
people of our State?"&#xD;
"My testimony," said Leblond, would not essen-&#xD;
tially differ from the Judges; and I will not, there-&#xD;
fore; occupy your time by narrating it. I must,&#xD;
however, mention one little incident. While pas~&#xD;
sing along, I met with an old college acquaintance,&#xD;
~ lawyer of some distinction, who was opposed to&#xD;
this temperance movement-a kind, amiable man,&#xD;
and unusually interested in the welfare of his fain-&#xD;
dy-after he had offered some reasons against the&#xD;
law, which doubtless appeared to him cogent; with-&#xD;
out attempting - to answer his arguments, I said,&#xD;
"My dear sir, you and I have had sense sufficient&#xD;
to avoid the intoxicating cup; what assurance have&#xD;
we that. our sons will escape the sin of drunken-&#xD;
ness? We can not foresee the ten thousand temp-&#xD;
tations that may beset them, and guard them&#xD;
&#xD;
against yi~ding? But, should our counsel save&#xD;
them, what evidence have we that our daughters&#xD;
may not form alliances with gentlemen who have&#xD;
not had the advantage of wise and early counsel.&#xD;
and consequently become drunkards ?-a calamity&#xD;
that no man would feel more poignantly than&#xD;
yourself.&#xD;
Well," said he, hesitating some, " that's a fact~&#xD;
I have never looked iitj~on it ifl that light. I don~t&#xD;
know but the safety of all requires the removal of&#xD;
the temptation, and all that might lead to tempta.-&#xD;
tion. Drunkenness is a ~terrible vice ! You arc&#xD;
probably not far wrong. Drinking, even moder-&#xD;
ately, benefits no man.'&#xD;
"I find the law not in advance of public opmm-&#xD;
ion, but sustained wherever I have been," said&#xD;
.Iewett. So frightful has been the destruction&#xD;
from this cause of the~ citizens of our State, that&#xD;
any mea~surc calculated to save, attracts attention.&#xD;
and meets with favor.&#xD;
"Sir Mathew Ilale, after twenty years experi-&#xD;

coy cry of Sir Matthew, and generally ~cribe more&#xD;
than nine-tenths of all the crime committed, to&#xD;
the use of intoxicating drinks, and hence invoke&#xD;
the aid of any measure the tendency of which is&#xD;
to remove this evil."&#xD;
"The law works admirably," said Tompkins.-&#xD;
"In a tour through the State, I have not seen a&#xD;
drop of liquor, nor a drunken man, except in one&#xD;
village; but more of that hereafter. In the county&#xD;
of II-, I was told by the Jailor that the Jail was&#xD;
entirely empty; an occurrence which had not be-&#xD;
fore happened within the last twenty-five years.&#xD;
And," continued he, "I cannot forego ihe pleas-&#xD;

my great astonishment, there stood a pensive little&#xD;
girl with down cast countenance, clad in the habi-&#xD;
liments of the most abject poverty. I took her by&#xD;
the hand and kindly inquired the object of her&#xD;
mission, sd early in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Mi'. Tompkins,' said she, 'I was afraid you&#xD;
would leave town before I could get up; and&#xD;
when I went to bed last night, I thought I could&#xD;
keep awake all night, and as soon as it was day-&#xD;
light, I could come up, but I couldn't keep awake.'&#xD;
In as tender a tone as I could assume, I enquired&#xD;
what was the trouble.&#xD;
"Won't you see my pa before you leave? May&#xD;
he you can coax him not to drink any more? Oh,&#xD;
if he would do as you told everybody, last night,&#xD;
how happy we would 1)0 ! Sister and I had pa go&#xD;
with us to the lecture, and when he came home he&#xD;
cried for more thaii an hour ; and we all cried, and&#xD;
pa J)vomised mother he would quit drinking; but,&#xD;
as soon as lie goes down street he gets into some&#xD;
of the wicked taverns, or groceries and forgets his&#xD;
promise, and we are then all so unhappy."&#xD;
I enquired how long' he had been drinking.&#xD;
"It has beeti about two years. 'When he com-&#xD;
menced we had a good home, hut pa went to drink-&#xD;
ing and paid no attention to his business ; and Mr.&#xD;
~JftCOi)S, the tavern-keeper, two months ago, sold&#xD;
our house to pay- for whiskey pa had got from him;&#xD;
and now, every time Mr. Jacob's little girls meet&#xD;
us they say 'your father is a drunkard, and you&#xD;
are dirty, ragged, little girls, and we won't play&#xD;
with you.' Mr. Toinpkinsis not the man who sells&#xD;
~he liquor to pa, as bad a.~ he? Sister and I can't&#xD;
help pa's drinking; we coax him every day to quit;&#xD;
and we pray for him every night, and it is too bad&#xD;

T4&#xD;
&#xD;
3~2           Th~ UNJUST JUDGE.&#xD;
for Mr. Jacob's little girls to abuse us so, ain't it,&#xD;
Mr. Tompkins? Won't you go down and see pa?&#xD;
He hasn't been drinking any this morning. Ma&#xD;
told me about the Maine law, but I couldn't under-&#xD;
stand it. XYiIl it hang all the wicked men thw&#xD;
sell liquor? I don't like it if it does that, Mr.&#xD;
Tompkins. But they are no better than pa, and&#xD;
other poor men they will Kill, if the Maine law&#xD;
don't conic and stop them."'&#xD;
Here this poor, crushed child xvept as if hci&#xD;
little heart would break; and, thoytg hyou may- re-&#xD;
gard it as an indication of weakness in me, I cried.&#xD;
too; nor could I have avoided it had a kingdom&#xD;
been tendered me. After' I became calm, for iii&#xD;
was some time before I could either conceive a&#xD;
thought or give utterance to one; I said, 'go home,&#xD;
my dear, and be a good girl, and in less than three&#xD;
days yoi~r father will again be a sober man; for.&#xD;
before I leave the village, we will close the liquor&#xD;
establishments and remove all temptation from&#xD;
him."'&#xD;
'~Did you redeem your promise?" inquired Judge&#xD;
Jones.&#xD;
"The first day was sufficient for the work! 'Ws&#xD;
made sad havoc among the groceries; and oi~ yes-&#xD;
terday, I received a letter from the little girl ,~'-&#xD;
which he drew from his pocket and read, amid th~&#xD;
sobs and tears of these men who have left their&#xD;
Foot-prints on the sends of tirne."&#xD;
