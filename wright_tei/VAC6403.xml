               <head type="sub">A DOLLAR BOOK FOR TEN CENTS!</head>
               <p>THIS series comprises many of the choicest Works of Fiction and Romance yet
                  offered to the public. They are descriptive of Border, Indian, Trapper and Hunter
                  Life. Each book will be a complete novel of itself. Authors of first class
                  reputation will furnish the tales which will far surpass in interest and graphic
                  power any similar works.</p>

                  <item>
                     <title>No. 1. THE DEAD BOXER; or Secret Blow.</title> It is exceedingly
                     interesting to travel through this beautiful story, with such a descriptive
                     writer, and to follow the hero of the tale through all his manly
                     bearings.</item>
                  <item>
                     <title>No. 2. MILDRED; or Forbidden Love.</title> There is not a single person,
                     who once having taken up this book, will willingly lay it down until he has
                     read every line. The plot is thrillingly interesting; the language full of
                     fiery eloquence; the love passages will find a responsive answer in every
                     loving heart.</item>
                  <item>
                     <title>No. 3. THE MIDNIGHT LAMP; or Life in the Empire City.</title> This
                     admirable romance far surpasses any similar work, in the rapidity with which
                     incident follows incident and in the bold and strikingly painted
                     characteristics of each actor.</item>
                  <item>
                     <title>No. 4. MARK MYRTLE; or the Maniac Hunter.</title> The hero of this novel
                     is one of the most interesting characters ever delineated, and his exploits
                     surpass in boldness and brilliancy the most glowing.</item>
                  <item>
                     <title>No. 5. WOLF CAP, or Button Shooter's Last Tramp.</title> Fearfully
                     interesting are the strange scenes in this book; wild hunters, wild beasts, and
                     wilder savages run riot in its exciting pages. No book of its class can begin
                     to compare with it.</item>
                  <item>
                     <title>No. 6. THE RIVAL PLOTTERS; or the Patriots and Loyalists of '76.</title>
                     This novel is one of touching and thrilling interest, well calculated to
                     enchain attention and to create remark. It gives a true picture of the patriots
                     and loyalists of the war for Independence.</item>
                  <item>
                     <title>No. 7. IANTHE; or Slaver's Last Cruise.</title> It will be hard to
                     choose among sea and love stories, one more alive with the spirit of the waters
                     and the heart than this really excellent production. Smugglers, wreckers and
                     red hand pirates are the actors in this work.</item>
                  <item>
                     <title>No. 8. BOB ROCK; or Prairie Scout.</title> This famous scout was the
                     terror of the demon red-skins, with a heart of steel and an eye keen as a
                     scalping-knife, he could out-ride, out-shoot and out-fight the greatest chiefs
                     ever known.</item>
                  <item>
                     <title>No. 9. TENESEPA; or Friendly Sioux.</title> The reader seems actually to
                     hear the yell of the demons in their cruel work of massacre and to see their
                     bloody scalping knives dripping with blood. Terrible adventures crimson every
                     page.</item>

                     <title>No. 10. KING DICK; or Steel and Shoulder.</title> This is just the book
                     to please every one. The characters introduced, and the drama in which they are
                     made to play, are alike singular and pleasing. To the lovers of what is
                     stirring in person and incident this novel will afford great pleasure.</item>
                  <item>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Which introduces a nice little girl, and an accident.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I must have been about eighteen years old, or thereabouts, when, on a holiday in
                  June, I walked out, and strolled by the high road to the country beyond Puttenham.
                  The highway led me to a common over which it crossed; and there, musing over the
                  commonplace events of the week, I wandered over the knolls of gravelly soil, and
                  among the furze-bushes, watching the donkies as they cropped the scanty blades of
                  grass, and indulged occasionally in a tit-bit, in the way of a juicy thistle.
                  Tired at length, I sat me down to rest under a thorn-bush by the road-side, and
                  was thus seated when I heard the sound of voices. Looking up, I saw a man
                  approach, who was leading by the hand a little girl who appeared to be about ten
                  years of age. I was struck with the appearance of the couple, and so scanned them
                  closely.</p>
               <p>The man was short, thick-set, and well-stricken in years. He was clad in a plain
                  suit of black, considerably worn, and much dusted by travel; and he wore a black
                  felt hat, with a very wide brim. His complexion was swarthy, and his eyes were
                  keen and deeply set beneath long and bushy eye brows. On his face he wore a thick,
                  grey moustache—a thing quite uncommon in England at that time In fact, it was the
                  first I had ever seen off the stage of a theatre. His hair was jet black in color,
                  streaked here and there with white, and fell in glossy curls to his shoulders; but
                  when he removed his hat for a moment to wipe the perspiration from his fore head,
                  I noticed that the hair in a wide circle over the crown was not ever a half inch
                  in length, as though it has grown after having been recently shaved. His walk was
                  slow and steady, and, although he occasionally threw searching glances around him
                  his eyes were generally bent on the ground.</p>
               <p>My gaze, however, was riveted most firmly to the little girl. She was the very
                  perfection of childish beauty and I had never seen before, nor have I beheld
                  since, anything so exquisitely lovely. Her complexion was clear and delicate, with
                  that thin skin, in which the color comes and goes at every fleeting emotion. Her
                  features were of as perfect an outline as ever poet imagined, or painter drew
                  There was but little color in the cheeks, but the lips were intensely red, and the
                  lower one looked like a ripe, pulpy<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6403-00000004"/> cherry.
                  Her form, well shown by a closely-fitting dress, seemed to be most symmetrical;
                  and the mould of her ancles and feet would have delighted a sculptor. But her eyes
                  were the most striking of all. Large, lustrous and passionate, in color of the
                  deepest hazel, with the iris floating in a sea of liquid pearl, they beamed with a
                  mingled fire and softness from beneath their long, dark lashes, in a way to haunt
                  the memory of the gazer for many days afterward. She was a mere child—a little,
                  innocent, dreamy-looking girl; but I rose to my feet as she came forward, and felt
                  an emotion of tenderness for the beautiful being, which, had she been older, could
                  only have been inspired by love. As it was I was fascinated.</p>
               <p>The man saw me, stopped, removed his hat, and addressed me a question in a foreign
                  tongue. I knew the language to be Spanish, for I had heard similar sounds once
                  before; but I could not understand the meaning. I showed, this, doubtless, by my
                  looks, for he replaced his hat, bowed slightly, and moved on. It happened,
                  however, that the music-teacher of my adopted sister, who was a Frenchman, had
                  given me frequent lessons in his language, and having labored to acquire it during
                  a whole year, I managed to speak it fluently enough, though with a defective
                  accent. My admiration for the child made me forget this, and almost everything
                  else; and it was only when the couple had turned, and the spell of the little
                  girl's eyes had passed, that I recalled to mind my accomplishment. Thinking the
                  man might possibly understand me, I called after him in French, and asked how I
                  could serve him. He turned instantly, his countenance expressing great
                  satisfaction, and replied in the same tongue:</p>
               <p>"I should be glad, my son, if you could tell me the distance to the town of
                  Puttenham."</p>
               <p>"Two miles from the milestone which stands at the mouth of yonder quarry, sir. You
                  can see the town from the rising ground just beyond."</p>
               <p>As I spoke I joined them in their walk toward the town. The man resumed his
                  questions.</p>
               <p>"How far thence is the chateau of the Lord Landeeze?"</p>
               <p>"Landys Castle, I suppose you mean. The park commences about a mile on the other
                  side of town, but the castle is at least two miles farther, and stands back nearly
                  a half mile from the high road. There is a near path which cuts off much of the
                  distance."</p>
               <p>"Is milord at home?"</p>
               <p>"I believe so."</p>
               <p>"He is a very tall, stately gentleman, is he not? He has dark grey eyes, and brown
                  hair, not unlike your own, in color I mean, for yours is straight and his is
                  curled?"</p>
               <p>"No; you describe his second-cousin, the former earl, who died about two years
                  since, and who rarely visited the place. The present earl is stately enough, and
                  tall; but he has light grey eyes, and light, reddish, yellow hair, such as we call
                  sandy."</p>
               <p>The man seemed staggered at this.</p>
               <p>"Dead!" he exclaimed, "about two years since!"</p>
               <p>I nodded my head affirmatively.</p>
               <p>We walked for a few minutes in silence. Then he turned suddenly and questioned me
                  again.</p>
               <p>"How did he die?"</p>
               <p>"I can only tell you what is generally rally believed here," I replied. "He had
                  been absent from England for many years, traveling restlessly all over the world.
                  He was last heard from at Valparaiso, where he took passage in a schooner bound to
                  Mazatlan, whence he intended to cross over-and to Vera Gruz, and to go thence by
                  way of Havana to the United States. The vessel was wrecked near her port, and all
                  on board perished, except his lordship's valet. He returned about a year and a
                  half since, and brought the news of his master's death."</p>
               <p>He muttered something in Spanish, and then resumed his questions.</p>
               <p>"And the second-cousin succeeded. Ah, yes! I know your English law—the nearest
                  heir-male."</p>
               <p>"Not exactly," I replied. "His second-cousin did succeed him, undoubtedly; but as
                  the nearest heir, and not as the nearest heir-male."</p>
               <p>"I do not understand the distinction. "What is it?"</p>
               <p>"Because," I said, "the earldom of Landys is unlike many, and for all I know,
                  unlike any other title in the peerage. It is of a very old creation, and the title
                  and estates are entailed on the senior heir, without regard to sex. If a female,
                  and she marries, the husband becomes earl through his wife's right, to the
                  exclusion of the next of kin. The grandfather of the late earl was a commoner, but
                  on his marriage with the young Countess of Landys, entered on the wife's title and
                  estate. The late earl was childless, having never married, and so the next heir,
                  the son of his father's cousin, succeeded."</p>
               <p>The Spaniard seemed to be revolving something in his mind, and walked along for
                  awhile in silence. I pleased myself during the interval by watching the movements
                  of the child, who tripped along, walking naturally and gracefully, as most girls
                  of her age do. At length the man raised his head and inquired:</p>
               <p>"The present earl—is he married?"</p>
               <p>"He is," I replied, "and has a child about four years old, a son."</p>
               <p>The eyes of the stranger flashed angrily, but the gleam of passion passed, and was
                  followed by an expression half smile and halt sneer.</p>
               <p>"What kind of man is the earl," he asked, "I mean as to mind and manners?"</p>
               <p>"That," I answered, "would be hard for me to tell. I have no opportunities of
                  judging of either."</p>
               <p>"I should have supposed," said the stranger, "from your familiarity with the
                  family history, that you were a connexion or friend."</p>
               <p>I laughed at this, and said:</p>
               <p>"You will not be in Puttenham long before you learn that the townsfolk are
                  naturally interested in the Landys family, since the earl owns about one-half the
                  town—the rest belonging to old Sharp, the miser. My position debars me from any
                  special intimacy with a peer."</p>
               <p>"Your position; may I ask, 'without offending you, what that is?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, I am a printer's apprentice at your service—apprentice and adopted son
                  of John Guttenberg, printer and stationer."</p>
               <p>"You! a printer?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing more sure."</p>
               <p>"Do printer's apprentices in this part of the world usually learn French?"</p>
               <p>"I believe not; but I have a taste for languages."</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6403-00000005"/>
               <p>We had now reached the edge of the town, and my companion having asked where he
                  could obtain lodging, I directed him to the Crown and Angel, a respectable,
                  middle-class inn, situated on the main street. He bowed formally, gave me a
                  profusion of thanks for my courtesy, and so we parted. I stood and gazed after him
                  and the little girl as she walked by his side, her body, gently swaying, and her
                  glossy hair, which hung in unrestrained waves down her back, glistening in the
                  sunshine. A turn of the street hid them from my sight; and then I walked to the
                  lodgings of a friend with whom I purposed to spend the remainder of the day.</p>
               <p>This friend was a young London artist, fastly rising into note in his profession,
                  who came annually to Puttenham, and spent a couple of months' time there and
                  thereabouts, partly to sketch, for there was some beautiful scenery around the
                  place, and partly to fish, for there was an excellent trout stream in the
                  neighborhood. His name was Paul Bagby. We had met while I was spending a Saturday
                  afternoon—a half holiday always allowed me—fishing on the banks of the
                  Willowfringe; and, from the admiration I expressed at a huge trout he dexterously
                  captured, we became acquaintances. He had his sketch-book with him, and I begged a
                  sight at the drawings, which he was good enough to let me have. Finding that I
                  admired art and artists, he invited me to call at his lodgings, and I was glad to
                  accept the invitation. Being John Guttenberg's adopted son, I had received a fair
                  English education, and was not, in either manner or language, what the world
                  expected to find in an ordinary apprentice-boy. Paul was struck by some boyish
                  remark I made when looking at his sketches—its oddity tickled his fancy—perhaps my
                  unfeigned admiration for his productions tickled his vanity too—and we became
                  friends. He gave me lessons in drawing, and during his stay would frequently come
                  to the shop and beg a holiday for me that I might accompany him in his sketching
                  rambles. My master never refused this, for Mr. Bagby was becoming distinguished,
                  and was patronized by the Landys family, the last fact, of course, a high
                  recommendation to the favor of the townsfolk. Beside this he was a very good
                  customer to our circulating library, taking out a fresh book nearly every day,
                  merely to dawdle over a few passages, and then throw it aside. He was lively, made
                  many queen remarks, and used to drop in at the shop along with the officers and
                  others, and to tell all kinds of funny stories to Mrs. Guttenberg and Mary, who
                  had charge of that part of the business. He was a great favorite with the family,
                  as he appeared to be with every one else.</p>
               <p>But Bagby was not at home, having left in the morning on a sketching tour, and I
                  turned to go elsewhere. Longing to have another look at the little girl whose
                  childish beauty had so impressed me. I made my way to the inn, knowing that by
                  taking a street which ran diagonally, I would reach there before the Spaniard and
                  his daughter, who had taken the longer and usual way.</p>
               <p>The Crown and Angel was in Charter street, which was the principal avenue of the
                  town, and the house stood at the corner of the market square. By going through
                  Billet lane I arrived at the inn first. On entering the public room I called for a
                  mug of ale, not that I wanted a drink, but because I desired a pretext for
                  remaining. The waiter sat it before me, and it was still untasted when I heard an
                  uproar without, and ran to the door with the rest, to learn the cause.</p>
               <p>Two runaway horses attached to an empty phæton were galloping furiously down the
                  street, everybody getting out of the way, and no one attempting to stop the
                  infuriated animals. As they came near the inn, the Spaniard and little girl
                  emerged from the cross street, and walked toward the Crown and Angel. A dozen
                  voices called to them to go back; but the man, not understanding English, did not
                  think the words to be addressed to him, or was probably so lost in thought as not
                  to hear the noise. He still advanced, the little girl accompanying him. I called
                  to him in French to take care, and springing forward, dragged the child out of the
                  horses' path. The man saw his danger, and leaped desperately forward, but the hub
                  of one of the wheels struck him on the hip, and threw him forward violently on his
                  face. The horses, as though startled by the occurrence, stopped suddenly, and were
                  at once secured by the bystanders.</p>
               <p>The stranger was picked up insensible, carried into the inn, and a surgeon sent
                  for. The little girl was almost frantic at first, but soon calmed when she
                  recognized me as one whom she had met before, though only for a few minutes; and
                  though she understood none of my words, I was enabled by soothing looks and
                  gestures to reassure her. In a few minutes her father recovered his senses, but
                  was evidently seriously injured, as the blood on his face denoted—even more
                  seriously hurt than at first appeared, for when the surgeon came he pronounced the
                  hip to be dislocated. The patient was at once removed to a chamber, and the
                  dislocation with great difficulty reduced. The operation was doubtless very
                  painful; but the Spaniard, during its continuance, merely set his teeth firmly
                  together, and did not even groan. So soon as the head of the bone resumed its
                  proper position, he fainted, but quickly recovered, and in a short while, although
                  the parts around the joints were much swollen, enjoyed comparative ease.</p>
               <p>The child would not be separated from her father, but obeyed every order given by
                  signs to remain quiet—keeping her large eyes fixed on the sufferer during the
                  operation, and wiping the large drops of perspiration from his forehead.</p>
               <p>As I was the only person present who could act as interpreter, I was forced to
                  remain nearly an hour. During that time the Spaniard, who gave his name as Jose
                  Espinel, requested me to tell the landlord that he preferred to remain there
                  rather than to go to the public hospital, and that he had sufficient means to pay
                  for the required accommodation. This I did, and at his further request made the
                  landlord send by the carrier to the next town, Puddleford, for his own
                  portmanteau, and his daughter's trunk, both of which had been left there. He
                  explained to me that he could not obtain a conveyance that morning, and, being
                  anxious to get to Puttenham, had walked over, getting a lift for himself and the
                     child<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6403-00000006"/> part of the way in a farmer's
                  cart. He requested me to visit him often while he lay there, which I promised to
                  do if permitted. I pressed his hand, patted the child on the shoulder, and left
                  the two together.</p>
               <p>When I got home I found that the news of the accident had preceded me—indeed by
                  that time had been spread throughout the town. Captain Berkeley, of the stationed
                  regiment, was commenting on the matter as I entered the shop, and complimented me
                  as a "doocid plucky little fellah." Mrs. Guttenburg, who looked upon me as a kind
                  of hero for having pulled, the child out of the way of the horses, made a great
                  many inquiries about the couple, and seemed very proud of the compliment paid me
                  by the captain. Mary asked if the little girl were pretty, and on my answering in
                  the affirmative, said that when we grew up we would be married—as that was the way
                  in all the novels and plays. As for John Guttenberg, he merely said that I had
                  acted properly enough; and when I told him of the Spaniard's request, added that I
                  might spend two hours with him during the day, and the entire evenings, if he
                  desired it—a permission I was not slow to accept.</p>

                  to be, up to the commencement of the story, he shall hear at once.</p>
               <p>Mr. John Guttenberg, although born in England, was the grandson of a German
                  printer, and was himself a master of the printer's art and mystery. He came of a
                  race of printers, and boasted that from the time of his great ancestor, who had
                  divided with Fust and Schœffer the honor of introducing moveable types, the
                  eldest-born of the family had always been a typesetter. Mr. John Guttenberg was a
                  staid, sober and respectable tradesman, the master of a well-conducted
                  printing-office, and the publisher of a country newspaper at the town of
                  Puttenham, in the Southwestern part of England. He was also a book-seller, and
                  kept a circulating library, whereof the officers of a marching regiment, quartered
                  in the neighborhood, and all the people of consequence there, as well as many who
                  were of no consequence at all, were patrons.</p>
               <p>Puttenham was a place having pretensions to size and respectability. It boasted of
                  several public buildings, including a Retreat for Decayed Malsters, founded by the
                  will of Gervase Thompson, a retired brewer; the County Jail and Court-house, for
                  Puttenham was the shire town; the stocks and public pound; a fine old church,
                  planned by Sir Christopher Wren, and erected in 1701; three Dissenters'
                  Meeting-Houses, each rectangular and many-windowed; and a public square,
                  highly-ornamented by the stocks, a pump and two long horse-troughs. The church had
                  a most excellent clock, made by a famous clock-maker in London, and had four
                  dials, placed to face the four points of the compass.</p>
               <p>Of all these things, I insist more particularly on John Guttenburg and the town
                  clock, since both have a deal to do with the early part of my life. To the one I
                  am indebted for my rearing, and to the other for my name; and I hold both my
                  benefactors in grateful remembrance.</p>
               <p>Mr. John Guttenberg, I repeat, was a staid, sober, and respectable tradesman.
                  Physically, nature had not been lavish of her choicest gifts upon his person,
                  since he was but five feet five inches in height, but as he was nearly as rotund
                  as one of his own ink-balls, the deficiency of length was compensated for by the
                  extent of breadth; and in like manner, a brevity of nose was balanced by an
                  extreme length of chin; and a mouth in shape and size like the button-hole of a
                  great coat, atoned for by a pair of ears whose length caused them to invade the
                  domain of the hat above, and encroach on that of the shirt-collar below. Mentally,
                  he was rather above the greater part of his neighbors, having energy,
                  quick-sightedness in business affairs, and some concentration of purpose. Morally,
                  he was well endowed, and in addition to a warm heart, possessed a fair share of
                  honor, as he understood the sentiment, and an abhorrence of what he deemed a mean
                  action. The robbers of old, those fellows who went robbing and ruffianizing over
                  the country in sheet-iron coats and trousers, would not have recognized him as a
                  chivalrous gentleman. Yet, I assert that John Guttenberg, tradesman as he was, and
                  therefore by occupation supposed to be devoid of such feeling, had as much of such
                  chivalric impulse in his nature as ever shed its lustre upon the Knights of the
                  Round Table or the Peers of Charlemagne. It is true that he had some prejudices,
                  and he evinced a slavish deference to those above him in social position; but
                  these were common to the tradesman of that time and place, and, judging from
                  history, not incompatible with knightly acts. And if he were occasionally betrayed
                  into a slight excess, it was only at rare intervals, and upon great occasions.</p>
               <p>Two and thirty years ago to a day—I am writing this upon the third day of
                  December, in the year of grace one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine—the
                  publisher of the Puttenham <title>Chronicle</title>, being a Councilman, attended
                  a meeting of the Corporation. After the council had closed its session, he
                  accepted an invitation to dine with the Mayor, a wealthy soap-boiler of the town,
                  and sat late with his worshipful host and friends over the wine and walnuts.
                  Although, as he afterwards explained to Mrs. Guttenberg, he was exceedingly sober
                  when he left the Mayor's house, yet the sudden emergence from a warm to a cold
                  atmosphere, and the change from the bright, cheerful fire within, the more
                  cheerful company, and the still more cheerful wine, to the coldness and quiet
                  without, had a bewildering effect upon him. Instead of turning to the right, he
                  turned to the left, and pursued his way for some distance before he discovered his
                  error.</p>
               <p>He stopped and looked around him. It was difficult at first to find to what
                  quarter of the town he had strayed. At length he recognized a barber's pole, which
                  stood before a low house at the street-corner, and thus knew that his nearest road
                  homeward would be obtained by retracing his steps. Before he could turn he felt
                     a<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6403-00000007"/> hand upon his elbow. He looked
                  around and saw a tall, dark figure, with a coat closely buttoned up, and a heavy
                  fur collar over its shoulders. All that he could discover about the face was a
                  pair of flashing eyes that were fixed steadily on his own.</p>
               <p>"Well?" said the printer, enquiringly, and not without some apprehension, lest his
                  new companion might be a foot-pad.</p>
               <p>"Mr. John Guttenberg, I believe," said the other, in good enough English, but with
                  an accent that sounded foreign.</p>
               <p>"That is my name," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"You can do me an essential service."</p>
               <p>"I should be glad enough to do it," said the startled tradesman; "but it is rather
                  late, and Mrs. Guttenberg will wonder what detains me so long beyond my accustomed
                  hour. If you will call at my shop to-morrow, or rather to-day, for it is now long
                  past midnight, I shall be happy to hear what you may have to propose."</p>
               <p>The church clock struck two.</p>
               <p>"At this moment, or never," said the unknown. "When the day dawns it may be too
                  late."</p>
               <p>John Guttenberg was about to reply, when the other seized his arm with a firm
                  grasp, and urged his steps onwards in a direction opposite to his own house.
                  Resistance was useless, and although the printer was rather startled, he saw no
                  one to afford help, and so gave in to the will of his captor. Fifteen minutes
                  sharp walking, but through what streets he could not tell, sufficed to bring the
                  couple to the outside of a dilapidated building in an unfamiliar place. Into its
                  narrow and unlighted hall, and up its creaking stairs, the unknown led the
                  tradesman. Before the back-room in the third story, the stranger stopped, and
                  without announcing his approach, entered, dragging his companion after him, and
                  then closing the door.</p>
               <p>John Guttenberg, though greatly astounded at the whole matter, when he saw no
                  personal harm was intended to him, took a good look at the apartment into which he
                  had been so unceremoniously thrust.</p>
               <p>The room was devoid of comfortable furniture. There was an old and creaking deal
                  table, and a three-legged, oaken stool. On the former was a farthing candle,
                  inserted in an ordinary iron candle-stick. A scanty sea-coal fire glimmered at the
                  bottom of the grate. In the corner something lay wrapped up in a pile of ragged
                  clothes, over which a cloak was partly drawn. Near there, on the three-legged
                  stool, sat a woman, meanly clad, and, for the weather, insufficiently. She was
                  handsome, though her skin was dark, almost tawny—her hair especially being of an
                  unwonted blackness and glossiness, and, from the mass gathered at the back of the
                  head, exceedingly luxuriant in growth. She turned her eyes on the new-comer, and
                  seemed about to rise. The unknown raised his finger with a menacing motion, when
                  she sank back in her seat, and covered her face with her hands.</p>
               <p>"You have the reputation of being an honest and humane man," said the
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>"I hope so," said the printer.</p>
               <p>"You have, and I dare say it is deserved."</p>
               <p>The stranger paused a moment, and the woman sighed. John Guttenberg took a good
                  look at both. The woman, though dressed so commonly, had a well-proportioned hand
                  and wrist; and a portion of her underclothing, which protruded from the bosom of
                  her dress, was edged with what appeared to be costly lace. As for the stranger, he
                  was tall, handsomely dressed, though without cloak or surtout, and wore around his
                  neck a heavy collar, or rather a half cape of fur. His eyes were dark, but whether
                  grey, black, or hazel, could not well be seen, for his hat was so slouched over
                  his face as to throw them in shadow. He also wore a heavy beard and whiskers.</p>
               <p>"Take this child," he said; and as he spoke he lifted a young babe from the pile
                  of clothes in which it had been snugly stowed. The woman made a motion as though
                  to wrest it; but the stranger said something in a foreign tongue, when she shrank
                  back. "Take it home with you," he continued. "Here—this collar of fur will protect
                  it still further from the cold. Here are fifty pounds. Do with the brat as you
                  like. Make a printer of him—bring him up as you think fit—give him what name you
                  choose. You shall hear from me again. Come, it is time for you to go home."</p>
               <p>"But," remonstrated the printer, holding the babe at arm's length, "I don't choose
                  to—"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said the woman, rising, and commencing to speak.</p>
               <p>"Diyum!" cried the unknown, angrily.</p>
               <p>The woman was cowed, either by the strange word, which she apparently understood,
                  or by his manner, for she resumed her seat, wringing her hands, piteously.</p>
               <p>The babe looked up in the printer's face, and smiled—at least, that contortion of
                  the lips which passes for a smile in new-born babes made its appearance. John
                  Guttenberg, whose married life was childless, found himself involuntarily pressing
                  the little innocent to his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Come," said the stranger, "it is time to go."</p>
               <p>The woman darted forward, snatched the child, and gave it a kiss—then returned it
                  with a sigh. As she did so, she slipped into John Guttenberg's hand a small paper
                  packet.</p>
               <p>"Come!" said the stranger again, and he led the bewildered printer, who seemed to
                  have lost all power of resistance, out of the room, down stairs and along the
                  streets—by what route it seemed impossible to say—to the door of the latter's
                  house. There the bearer of the child plucked up courage, and was about to return
                  the charge thus thrust upon him, when he discovered that the other had turned the
                  nearest corner and disappeared.</p>
               <p>"Oh, well! never mind!" said the printer to himself, as he opened the door with
                  his latch-key, "I'll send the little fellow to the poor-house in the morning."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Guttenberg had not retired to rest. She knew that her husband had dined with
                  the Mayor, and expecting him to return a little flushed with wine, had prepared a
                  series of moral observations, specially adapted to his case. To her great surprise
                  his face had a look far more sober and melancholy than usual, and to her greater
                  surprise she saw him unroll from a bundle of furs and clothing, a very little
                  child. The babe, which by this time had grown hungry, began to wail.</p>
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6403-00000008"/>
               <p>"Bless me.!" said the wife, "if the man hasn't a baby! Who's is it?"</p>
               <p>"That's precisely what I'd like to know," replied the husband.</p>
               <p>"But how did you come by it?"</p>
               <p>"That's precisely what I mean to tell you, if it will only stop its whining."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Guttenberg took the babe in her arms. It was dressed in a long frock of
                  cross-barred muslin; but around one arm was a strip of yellow lace, of an
                  exceedingly rare and costly kind; and the short sleeves of the dress, with those
                  of the silk and flannel underclothes, were looped up and joined together by two
                  bracelets of turquoises, chained with gold after a quaint and peculiar fashion.
                  Around the babe's neck was suspended by a coarse flaxen thread, a plain gold ring.
                  Inside of this were some peculiar characters. The letters M and T were to be made
                  out distinctly; but the others seemed to be mere hieroglyphics. The inscription,
                  which was deeply engraven, was as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The fur in which the child was wrapped was of the richest Russian sable, and
                  underneath it was a shawl whose material was afterwards ascertained to be true
                  cashmere. The babe raised its large grey eyes to the face of the good woman, and,
                  curling its little lip, renewed its piteous wailing.</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I don't know what to do with it," said the printer's wife. "It wants
                  feeding, poor thing, and I don't believe there's a drop of milk in the house. Jane
                  gave the last to the cat before she went to bed."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, Jane has a baby herself, and—"</p>
               <p>"Dear me! so she has. I never thought of that. I'll wake her."</p>
               <p>And she did. Jane came. As she was about to take the child, it again indulged in
                  that facial contortion which young mothers call a smile.</p>
               <p>"Why," exclaimed Mrs. Guttenberg, "it is the sweetest babe. There, Jane, take care
                  of him until morning. He seems to be very hungry."</p>
               <p>Jane experimented before reporting. "It feeds uncommon strong, mum," she said.
                  "It's a rare, hearty babe, mum."</p>
               <p>And presently off went Jane, with the new comer in charge.</p>
               <p>John Guttenberg told his wife all that had occurred to him, including the fact
                  that the apparent mother had slipped a packet in his hand; but when he came to
                  that part of the story, for the first time he missed the paper. It was neither in
                  his hand nor on his person, and, after an unavailing search, he came to the
                  conclusion that he had dropped it on the way home.</p>
               <p>"What will you do with it?" inquired the wife.</p>
               <p>"Do with it! Give it up to the parochial authorities along with the money. I think
                  that is the proper course."</p>
               <p>"Is it like the man?"</p>
               <p>"I am not sure whether it is or not. He hid his face so that I cannot say. It's
                  not like the mother, I'm sure. Its eyes are grey, and hers are the blackest I ever
                  saw."</p>
               <p>"It's a pretty baby, John; a very pretty baby."</p>
               <p>"That's what you women say about all babies. It looks to me to have about as much
                  expression as a sheet of brown paper. However, its good or bad looks don't concern
                  us. The parish will have to take care of it."</p>
               <p>"John, we've been married four years come next May-day, and we have no
                  children."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"It's a boy, John."</p>
               <p>"Is it? What then?"</p>
               <p>"Suppose we keep him."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed! I have no idea of supporting other peoples' babies—at least not to
                  bring them up at my expense."</p>
               <p>"But it seems like the gift of Providence; and then the fifty pound, and the lace,
                  and the jewels, and the fur, and that beautiful soft shawl! It is not a poor man's
                  child, you may depend on that, and I think it will bring good luck."</p>
               <p>"Do you really want to keep it, Martha?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I do, John."</p>
               <p>"I should be annoyed to death with all kinds of ridiculous stories. People would
                  invent all kinds of strange stories, and some of them might even fancy—"</p>
               <p>"Well, let them fancy. I wouldn't believe that, nor any one that has eyes, for it
                  isn't a hair like you; that's easy to be seen."</p>
               <p>"It won't do, Martha."</p>
               <p>"Well, just as you choose; but it's very hard that you won't grant a little favor
                  like that, when I've taken a fancy to the child."</p>
               <p>"Little favor! very little to be sure—to be kept awake all night by some other
                  man's crying brat."</p>
               <p>"Do you hear it cry now?"</p>
               <p>"No, but—"</p>
               <p>"John, dear!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, well!" exclaimed the printer, inwardly delighted at his wife's perseverance
                  in a whim which accorded with his own wish, "you can keep it, if you will. But
                  what will you name the young fellow?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll find a name, never fear."</p>
               <p>The church clock struck three.</p>
               <p>"There!" she exclaimed, "there is a name now, and a very pretty one. You can see
                  it any day on the north dial of the clock. We'll call him Ambrose Fecit."</p>
               <p>"Ambrose <foreign xml:lang="LAT">fecit!</foreign> Why, my dear, do you know what
                  that means?"</p>
               <p>"Of course, I do. It means that Mr. Fecit made that clock. And a very good clock
                  it is, and a very pretty name too, and not very common either; for I never met any
                  of the Fecits in the course of my life."</p>
               <p>"I dare say not," replied the husband; and he leaned against the bedpost—the
                  latter part of the conversation occurring as they were disrobing for rest—and
                  laughed immoderately.</p>
               <p>And thus it was I had my name, and that was why I was bred a printer.</p>
               <p>As for the unknown couple, no inquiries could find them out, nor could John
                  Guttenberg, in his after rambles through the town, ever recognize the house from
                  whence he had taken me.</p>
               <p>The after history of my life, up to the period when I met the Spaniard and his
                  daughter, would show nothing remarkable. I was a healthy child and went through
                  the perils of teething and the measles safely. John Guttenberg and his wife
                  fulfilled their self-imposed task like good and conscientious people. I was
                  treated as though I were their own child, being duly lectured and birched when I
                  was naughty, and cuddled and candied when I was not. When I was about four years
                  old, Mrs. Guttenberg presented<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6403-00000009"/> sented her
                  husband, greatly to his gratification and her delight, with a daughter.
                  Everybody—for people knew me to be a foundling, though they did not know the
                  circumstances of my finding—declared that "my nose was put out of joint," and that
                  I might now look out for neglect, if not positive ill-treatment. Everybody was
                  mistaken. I was treated the same as usual. As for myself, I was too young to
                  understand these predictions, of which I knew nothing until afterwards. But I was
                  vastly delighted with the new-comer, on whom I used to gaze in the cradle with
                  wrapt admiration. It was the dawning of an amiable weakness which followed me
                  through life—a love and esteem for the opposite sex. As we grew up together I
                  loved the little Mary more and more. I brought her home all my trophies in the
                  shape of marbles and peg-tops; I expended my scanty pocket-money in hard-bake and
                  barley-sugar for her particular benefit; and after I had left school to be
                  instructed in the mysteries of my protector's craft, I used to take surreptitious
                  impressions of wood-cuts in colored inks, to ornament her play-house. I thought my
                  sister—for such I believed her to be until good-natured strangers taught me
                  better—to be the prettiest child in the world, my idea of beautiful eyes being
                  those of a mottled, light hazel hue, and my type of symmetrical noses the pug.</p>
               <p>During the early part of my life, and more especially in the first year of my
                  apprenticeship, I thought the Puttenham <title>Chronicle</title> to be the leading
                  newspaper of the world; and I felt more awful reverence for Mr. Hincks, the
                  editor, than I did for the Earl of Landys, whose estate lay within a mile of town,
                  or even the <choice>
                     <sic>ady</sic>
                     <corr>Lady</corr>
                  </choice> Caroline Bowlington, who came in her own coach once a year to make the
                  Dowager Countess of Landys a visit, and was the sole daughter of a Duke. For, did
                  not Mr. Hincks handle not only Dukes and Marquesses without gloves, but even
                  boldly attacked her Majesty's ministers—they being of the opposite party to ours?
                  Did he not sneer at the French, who, to be sure, were not much, as they all wore
                  wooden shoes, and lived on frogs, and spent the principal part of their lives in
                  hair-dressing, and giving dancing-lessons to one-another—a poor, lean set of
                  fellows, for any ten of whom a hardy Briton was a match at any time? And did he
                  not give, at times, a good setting-down to the Yankees, a nation of savages who
                  spoke a kind of will English, and scalped and ate their prisoners—whose women
                  chewed tobacco and spoke through their noses a people who had behaved so badly
                  that his Majesty, George the Third, after whipping them at Banker Hill and
                  Yorktown, and New Orleans, and I don't know how many more places finally cast them
                  off, and sent them about their own business, where they have been miserably ever
                  since? Then there was my fellow-apprentice, Tom Brown, who set up all the leaders,
                  and, in the absence of his master, even made up the form. My opinion of him was
                  that he had great force of character, combined with great knowledge of the world,
                  and had only to say the word, after he was out of his time, to be made a
                  prime-minister, or a member of parliament, er a beadle, or something else equally
                  important. And the fishermen who came on market days, with fish from the little
                  port of Puddleford, about five miles off, I regarded as men who went down into the
                  sea in ships, bold navigators who were ready to sail to the bottom of the
                  Maelstrom, if needed; though I did find fault with them for not frequently
                  hitching up their trousers by the waistband, and imprecating their tarry
                  top-lights, as the gallant sailor, who appeared in "Black-Eyed Seyeusan," when the
                  players made their annual visit, invariably did.</p>

                  the little girl.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.,</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein I become almost a Spanish Scholar, but lose both my Teachers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>The next day Paul Bagby, having heard of my adventure, called at the
                  printing-house. Learning that I was about to visit the patient, he volunteered to
                  accompany me, saying that in his two years' sketching tour on the Peninsula he had
                  made himself a tolerable master of the Castilian. We found the Spaniard lying upon
                  a couch, reading, while his little daughter sat near. He seemed glad to see me,
                  and when I presented the artist, received him with all the courtesy that his
                  constrained position would allow him to show. They entered into conversation in
                  Spanish, at my instance, and while they were thus engaged, I watched the child,
                  and noted the play of her features as she listened. Occasionally I joined in the
                  conversation, Espinel appealing to me at times in French. Their conversation, I
                  found by this, had turned upon the Earl of Landys, who seemed to be a subject of
                  deep interest to the Spaniard. The latter at length said to me in French:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur Bagby seems to admire milord Landees very much."</p>
               <p>"My faith!" said Paul, in the same language, "the admiration is merely gratitude
                  for patronage, of which I have received a deal through the Landys' interest."</p>
               <p>"D'Alembert pronounced quite a panegyric upon Louis XIV., because the king sent
                  forty arm-chairs to the Academy," said the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>"Exactly," replied Paul, laughing, "I might have bought as many as forty sofas
                  with the proceeds of Lord Landys' direct patronage, throwing aside the sitters he
                  has sent me; consequently, common gratitude requires that I should admire him as
                  much as D'Alembert did Louis XIV."</p>
               <p>"He is fond of pictures then. Has he many?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and some very fine ones. His gallery contains a picture from every modern
                  artist of note, with some fine specimens of the masters. By the by, he has a
                  picture painted by a foreign artist, the portrait of a monk, which, odd as it may
                  seem, bears a striking resemblance to you, senior."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! by one of the old masters?"</p>
               <p>"No; modern, undoubtedly."</p>
               <p>The surgeon now entered the room, and told us that the senior would not be able to
                  go about for some days, as the internal injuries were severe. Bagby translated
                  this to the patient, who merely replied that it was unfortunate, as he desired to
                  visit London at an early date. Bagby now rose to leave, and I, promising to return
                  in a few minutes, accompanied him down stairs.</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6403-00000010"/>
               <p>"What do you think of the couple?" I asked, when we were fairly out of the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"I think the child is the most beautiful creature of her age I ever saw," was the
                  answer, "and I intend to paint her portrait. As for her father, he is no father at
                  all, I fancy."</p>
               <p>"How do you come to that conclusion?"</p>
               <p>"A child always bears some resemblance to each parent. It may be only such as
                  those acquainted with those matters can point out; but it is always there.
                  Sometimes the upper part of the head is that of the father, and the lower that of
                  the mother, or <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice versa</foreign>. Then the face may be
                  that of one parent, when the back part of the head will have the configuration
                  peculiar to that of the other, or the reverse. Again, there may be a mingling of
                  the facial points. I have been studying the two with the eye of a naturalist, and
                  the analytical habit of an artist, and the girl's face, head, and physical
                  conformation, are totally unlike his, except in points that might be accidentally
                  similar. Besides, he is a monk, or has been until recently."</p>
               <p>"How do you make that out?"</p>
               <p>"His head bears the mark of the tonsure. The hair has been only suffered to grow a
                  short while."</p>
               <p>"It may have been shaved through illness."</p>
               <p>"Not a bit of it. In that case the shaving would not have been so regular, and
                  scarcely on the top of the head. Then you must remember, that although she called
                  him 'father,' and he addressed her as 'daughter,' he spoke of her to me all
                  through as 'this child,' 'this dear little girl,' and so on."</p>
               <p>"But," said I, "he spoke of her to me as 'the child he was bound to protect.'"</p>
               <p>"Precisely. It is not a parental obligation, you see, on which a parent, taking it
                  as a matter of course, would not insist. But you had better return to your
                  Spaniard. I'll see you again, and we'll talk the matter over farther. Call on me
                  to-morrow before you come here, and I will show you how far I have gone in the way
                  of painting her."</p>
               <p>"Do you expect her to sit, then?"</p>
               <p>"Sit? No. A face so remarkable is easily painted from memory. I won't get its
                  character and expression out of my mind for a twelvemonth."</p>
               <p>He left, and I returned to Espinel. The latter was reading when I came in, but put
                  the book down.</p>
               <p>"Do not let me interrupt you," said I. "If you are interested, go on; but first
                  tell me if I can order anything new for you of the landlord."</p>
               <p>"No; I am quite comfortable, and if you will, would prefer to talk."</p>
               <p>He then asked me a great many questions about the town and its vicinity, more
                  particularly about the Landys family, all of which I answered as well as I could.
                  At length he said:</p>
               <p>"How long since you commenced to study French?"</p>
               <p>"About a year since."</p>
               <p>"Are there many French people in this town?"</p>
               <p>"Only one that I know—the gentleman who gave me lessons—M. de Lille."</p>
               <p>"You must have great aptitude for acquiring languages Your accent is defective in
                  part, but wonderfully good to have been acquired during a year. How would you like
                  to study Spanish?"</p>
               <p>"Very much."</p>
               <p>"Repeat this;" and he uttered a few words in Castilian.</p>
               <p>I obeyed.</p>
               <p>"Very good; very good, indeed," said he, while the little girl clapped her hands
                  in delight. "You have caught the accent perfectly. You would find the Spanish
                  quite easy to master. Once learn the alphabetical sounds, and all after that is an
                  effort of memory. I know most European languages, but not English. I have been
                  thinking, as I have nothing better to do while fastened here, that I would like to
                  change lessons with you. I could get along fastly, for I am familiar with the Low
                  Dutch, which is nearly identical with the Low Saxon, one of the parents of the
                  English tongue. You shall teach me English, and I will return it with
                  Spanish."</p>
               <p>I acceded to the proposition, and the lessons began.</p>
               <p>We continued our studies all the time the Spaniard remained in Puttenham. In a
                  little time I had mastered the sounds of the Spanish language, and a good many
                  phrases, as well as the forms of its verbs. I was less fortunate as a teacher than
                  pupil. Espinel found it very difficult to get over some of our peculiar sounds,
                  and our exceptional orthography became a great stumbling-block. Fortunately there
                  was in our printing-room a Spanish grammar and dictionary, kept to determine the
                  proper spelling of Spanish words, when such had to be used in the
                     <title>Chronicle</title>, and these books were of great assistance.</p>
               <p>It was nearly four weeks before Senor Espinel was able to rise and walk about the
                  room. The shock had been a severe one to a man over fifty-six—for such he told me
                  was his age—and his recovery was slow. So earnestly did I labor during this time
                  that I had acquired quite a smattering of Castilian, and managed not only to
                  translate rapidly with the aid of the dictionary, but to keep up a brisk
                  conversation on ordinary subjects. I found myself, however, better able to
                  converse with the child than the old man Her prattle, simple as it was, I readily
                  understood, and my interest in her was so deep, that it became my greatest delight
                  to talk with her. Zara, for such was her name, had by this time grown quite
                  attached to me, and would come and sit on my knee, and lay her head on my
                  shoulder, while I told her some nursery ballad, or fairy story, in my imperfect
                  Spanish; or would prattle to me in a curious mixture of her own language with
                  English, which last tongue she acquired faster than Espinel. The Senor Jose,
                  meanwhile, with a table wheeled up to where he sat, worked hard in translating
                  some English book, and occasionally interrupted Zara and me to ask me the proper
                  form of some verb, or an explanation of a difficult idiom. How tenderly I loved
                  that pure and affectionate child! How delighted I was with her growing attachment
                  to me!</p>
               <p>At length the Senor Espinel was able to walk without serious difficulty, and
                  managed to call on Mr. Guttenberg, and thank him for permitting my attendance. My
                  protector received him civilly enough, but did not feel prepossessed in his favor.
                  This arose from the fact that Paul Bagby, then in London, had intimated,
                  previously to his departure, that Espinel was, or had been a monk. With all his
                  many good qualities, John Guttenberg had a strong sectarian prejudice.</p>
               <p>I left the Espinels one night about<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6403-00000011"/> ten
                  o'clock, having shaken hands with Don Jose, and kissed little Zara, who always
                  remained up from rest until I left. She said, as we parted:</p>
               <p>"Good night, brother Ambrosio. Some day Zara grow great big; then she spick
                  English much gooder as now."</p>
               <p>I smoothed her hair with my hand, and turned to go. As I left the landlord came
                  with a letter which had arrived by the evening mail, directed to the Senor Jose
                  Espinel. I noticed that it had the London mark.</p>
               <p>The next day, at noon, I went to see my friends as usual, and was told that the
                  Spaniard and his daughter had taken places the night before in the mail-coach for
                  London, and had departed at daybreak.</p>
               <p>"He left this for you," said the landlord.</p>
               <p>I tore open the letter. It was in French, and read in English thus:</p>

               <p>About two months after Zara and her father had left the town, Tom Brown, who had
                  been over to the shop for copy, told me that a package addressed to me had arrived

                  building, in the rear of a piece of ground on which the book-shop and
                  dwelling-house was built, and faced on a ten foot alley behind. I asked Tom what
                  the package was like, and why he did not bring it with him.</p>
               <p>"It is thin," answered he, "and looks like a big atlas, wrapped up in brown paper.

                  it, only they wouldn't let me. The Governor," meaning thereby his master, "said
                  you were to come in the shop shortly, as he wanted to see you. He is in a terrible
                  state of excitement, I can tell you, about the skeleton they picked up this
                  morning, and has got the traps they dug out with it."</p>
               <p>"I'll go as soon as I fill my stick," said I. "What skeleton, and where did they
                  find it?"</p>
               <p>"You know Sharp's old rookery, in the Ram's Horn?"</p>
               <p>The Ram's Horn was the cant name given to a crooked lane in the outskirts of the
                  town, inhabited by the poorest class of people.</p>
               <p>"Yes," I replied, "it tumbled down during the last storm."</p>
               <p>"Exactly; very much tumbled; went all to crash. Sharp sold it a little while since
                  to Bingham, who also bought the three next to it, and is about to build his new
                  brew-house there. They've been clearing out ruins and digging foundations all last
                  week. This morning, right in the center of what used to be the cellar of Sharp's
                  house, they came across a skeleton, in some rotten clothes. Old Dr. Craig says
                  that the bones belonged to a woman. The gold sleeve-buttons of the chemise were
                  there, and a gold pin, with a sky-blue stone in it, and some queer-shaped letters
                  on the back; the woman's name, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"What was the name?"</p>
               <p>"Queer—very—V. M. Taw. Mrs. Taw must have been made away with, and buried there;
                  at least that is everybody's say-so. They found a dagger there, the rummiest kind
                  of a knife, with a blade as crooked as a dog's hind-leg, and a carved wooden
                  handle, partly rotten. The Governor heard of it, and he bought all the things. I
                  think he means to keep 'em in the shop to draw custom. Old Sharp tried to get them
                  for the Museum, but the Governor was too quick for him. He is in a terrible pother
                  about something."</p>
               <p>"Who? Sharp?"</p>
               <p>"No; our old man. He and the mistress are holding a grand confabulation. I heard
                  'em mention your name as I went in."</p>
               <p>I finished my task, washed my hands, put off my apron, and went to the house. Mary
                  Guttenberg, a girl of fourteen, just turning into womanhood, was sewing in the
                  back part of the shop. Her father and mother were inside of the counter. Before
                  them were various articles, including the things Tom had spoken of. As I came
                  forward, Mrs. Guttenberg pointed to the larger package. I undid the fastenings,
                  and, after removing the wrapper, and two stout bits of binder's bands, placed on
                  either side to preserve it from injury, I found a portrait, one-fourth size, of
                  Zara Espinel. From the P. B. in the left-hand corner, I knew it to be the work of
                  Paul Bagby. As I opened it I discovered a letter, addressed to me. When I had
                  admired the portrait sufficiently, I opened the letter. It was from Paul, dated at
                  London, and these were the contents:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"<hi rend="i"/>My dear little type-slicker:</p>
                  <p>"Herewith you have a copy of my portrait of little Zara, whose untimely fate in
                     being whisked away by a grim, grey-bearded ogre, you have so much lamented. I
                     think that I have not only caught the features, but the whole spirit of her
                     extraordinary face. I should like your criticism on that point, for you were so
                     fond of her that her expression must be firmly fixed on your mind.</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Apropos</foreign> to Zara—who do you think I saw in
                     the Park yesterday? No other than that mysterious Don the Senor Espinel, My
                     conjecture concerning him was right. Don Jose is Fray Jose. He wore the suit of
                     black, with the out and style of the ecclesiastic. He was in a coach, with a
                     coat of arms on the panel, but it drove off and past before I could make out
                     more than a ducal coronet. I was on foot—what right has a
                        <unclear>poor</unclear> devil of an artist to ride anything but Shank's
                     mare? Our eyes met, and I bowed. He looked at me superciliously, as much as to
                     say, 'And who are you, pray? It was a cut—cool as a cucumber—unless I am very
                     much mistaken. There seemed to me to be a twitching about the corners of his
                     mouth, as though he enjoyed my discomfiture. I felt annoyed, and have made up
                     my mind to pick up a quarrel with his reverence on the first opportunity. Zara
                     was not with him. I should like to know where he has bestowed her. Would not
                     you?</p>
                  <p>"I have a famous commission. I am to make a series of paintings for a wealthy
                     Yankee—at least he came from New York, and I presume he is an American. He
                     wants a set of pictures, without limit as to number, of English life and
                     scenery. He is a perfect magnifico—as stately and proud as a baron of old—and
                     has lots of tin. His name is Archbold.</p>
                  <p>"Give my compliments to the worthy publisher of that astounding print, the
                     Puttenham <title>Chronicle</title>, and tell the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >redacteur-en chef</foreign> that ministers tremble at the thunders he
                     hurls, and the world generally shakes at his fulminations as usual. I have
                     three pictures ready for the exhibition of this year wherefrom I expect great
                     fame, unless the hanging committee treat me unfairly, and elevate my offspring
                     forty on bits high I have down vagabonds to do such things."</p>
               </q>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6403-00000012"/>
               <p>The rest of the letter was filled with gossip. I put it down and turned to view
                  the picture again, which Mary Guttenburg, who had laid down her work for the
                  purpose, now held in her hand.</p>
               <p>"How pretty she is!" exclaimed Mary, and her father and mother echoed her comment.
                  The likeness was wonderfully correct. The artist had caught the expression of
                  tenderness peculiar to her face, the liquidity of her dark eyes, and all the
                  poetry of her clouds of dark hair. He had brought to his task the whole force of
                  his genius, and every resource of his art.</p>
               <p>"What a sweet face!" continued Mary.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful, indeed!" said a voice behind us.</p>
               <p>We turned, and to our astonishment stood the Earl of Landy's, who bowed slightly
                  and apologetically. But the bend of his body was entirely wasted on a part of the
                  by-standers. Mr. John Guttenberg was filled with all that servile deference to a
                  peer which marks the true English tradesman. Had the Right Honorable John, Earl of
                  Landys, ex-member of the Privy Council, condescended to have thrown a flip-flap
                  then and there—an outrageous impossibility to suggest, I admit—my worthy patron
                  would have thought it in nowise incompatible with the dignity of the peerage. He
                  would have gone into ecstacies at the agility of the nobleman, and would have
                  avowed at once that no one below the rank of a marques could have thrown such a
                  flip-flap as that. He felt honored by the ill-bred peeping of the peer.</p>
               <p>All the Guttenburgs bowed profoundly; and the head of the family, with a smiling
                  face and a rubbing of the palms of the hands together—a trick of his when desiring
                  to be very courteous—inquired in what way he could have the honor of serving his
                  lordship.</p>
               <p>"I called, Mr. Guttenburg," said the Earl, "to say I would like to have the last
                  new novel, if it be in."</p>
               <p>I said to myself—</p>
               <p>"That is not true, my lord. You would have it sent you by the carrier from London;
                  or, had you wanted it from us, would have despatched a servant to obtain it. You
                  have some other motive for this extraordinary visit."</p>
               <p>However, though I thought all this I said nothing aloud, of course, but merely
                  stood there in a respectful attitude waiting to hear more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Guttenburg took down the book from the shelf, and did it up carefully in white
                  paper, offering to send it by me, but the Earl said he would take it himself, and
                  threw down the subscription-money.</p>
               <p>"Can I have the honor to serve your lordship in any other way?" inquired the
                  zealous bookseller. "Will your lordship condescend to accept a copy of this week's
                     <title>Chronicle?</title> You will find your lordship's recent arrival at
                  Landys Castle respectfully noticed under the proper head. Will your lordship deign
                  to be seated?"</p>
               <p>But his lordship preferred to stand.</p>
               <p>"Is that picture for sale?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Of course, your lordship. That is, it belongs to my adopted son there, Ambrose,
                  (pay your respects to his lordship, sir,) and no doubt he would be glad to dispose
                  of it if your lordship wished." And the bookseller contorted torted his brows and
                  looked at me as much as to say—""Why don't you offer it to him at once?"</p>
               <p>But I was determined not to part with the picture at all and said—</p>
               <p>"It is a gift from a friend, and therefore your lordship will see, cannot be
                  sold."</p>
               <p>"It is a very fine picture. What artist?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Paul Bagby my lord."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes! I see his mark. I might have known his style. I would like to have a
                  copy."</p>
               <p>"This is a copy, my lord. He retains the original."</p>
               <p>"Is it a fancy sketch or from life?"</p>
               <p>"From life, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! a very beautiful child then. I am much struck with the face and will
                  write to Mr. Bagby on the subject. By the by, Mr. Guttenberg, what is this story
                  about a skeleton having been found in the town? They tell me that you have some
                  curious relics."</p>
               <p>"Yes, your lordship," replied the printer; "and Mrs. Guttenberg, and myself—let me
                  have the honor of presenting Mrs. Guttenberg to your lordship's notice—were
                  discussing the matter just before your lordship entered the shop. It is very
                  singular taken in connection with the other circumstances; very singular indeed,
                  your lordship."</p>
               <p>"Is there a story, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, your lordship. Pray be seated, my lord. I am pained to see your lordship
                  standing. Mary, my dear, you may resume your former seat back there."</p>
               <p>Mary retreated to the rear of the shop, with a vexed expression on her
                  countenance; but she endeavored to listen as well as the distance would
                  permit.</p>
               <p>"You see, your lordship, that my wife and I are of the opinion that the skeleton
                  is connected with the history of this boy. If your lordship will deign to listen,
                  you shall judge for yourself. Don't go, Ambrose," continued he as I made a motion
                  to leave, "I intend to give his lordship your real history which you have never
                  heard yourself."</p>
               <p>He then detailed the circumstances I have before given to the readers of the
                  events of the night in which I came into his charge, and displayed the jewelry and
                  articles received with me, dwelling on the fact that the pin or brooch recently
                  found matched the bracelet before had, and bore an inscription similar to that on
                  the inside of the ring. I took up the pin as he spoke, and saw, deeply engraven on
                  the back:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"And was the package the woman gave you ever found?" inquired Lord Landys, when
                  the printer had finished his narration.</p>
               <p>"Never, your lordship?"</p>
               <p>"Your adopted son does you credit," said the Earl. "I hear that he is a young man
                  of correct deportment and very studious, as well as proficient in two or three
                  languages. If he desire it, he can have the use of my library occasionally. I will
                  speak to Mr. Osborn, my steward, to that effect on my return to the castle."</p>
               <p>I bowed my acknowledgment of the favor, and Mr. Guttenberg rubbed his hands and
                  bobbed his head with great assiduity.</p>
               <p>"And this portrait, you say Mr.—Mr.—"</p>
               <p>"Fecit, my lord." suggested Mrs. Guttenberg.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6403-00000013"/>
               <p>"Ah, yes! thank you. This portrait, you say, Mr. Fecit, is from life. Did I hear
                  you mention the name of the party?"</p>
               <p>"Her name is Zara, my lord. She is the daughter of a Spaniard who was in this town
                  some few months back, and who met with an accident which delayed him for several
                  weeks."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes! I remember. You rescued the child, I believe. I think I read some
                  account of it either in, or copied from the <title>Chronicle</title>. I believe
                  also," and here the nobleman fixed his eyes full on mine, "that this same Spaniard
                  did me the honor to inquire concerning me."</p>
               <p>How did he know that? I had never mentioned it to any one. I felt a a little
                  embarrassed, having no idea how far the queries might be pushed; but I
                  answered:</p>
               <p>"He did make some inquires concerning matters of interest in the neighborhood,
                  among the rest about your lordship's place and asked questions about your
                  lordship's family; but those were such as strangers are apt to put."</p>
               <p>"May I ask who he was and what he was?"</p>
               <p>"Senor Jose Espinel, my lord, I do not know his profession, if he had any; that is
                  not beyond doubt."</p>
               <p>"You conjecture then?"</p>
               <p>"Another does. It has been suggested to me that he was a monk or something of that
                  sort."</p>
               <p>"Was the child his daughter?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot say, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Will you do me the favor to describe the man?"</p>
               <p>"I complied as accurately as I was able, for though I felt the querist was
                  endeavoring to get from me all the information he could, there was no reason why I
                  should withhold what he wanted, and I was anxious to discover the cause of his
                  manifest interest, and thought that full replies might lead to a probable
                  conjecture on my part. The Earl mused a moment and then said:</p>
               <p>"Did you notice anything peculiar in his person or manner?"</p>
               <p>This was said carelessly, but at the <choice>
                     <sic>lattea</sic>
                     <corr>latter</corr>
                  </choice> part of the sentence his voice, as I thought trembled a little. I
                  watched him, therefore, curiously as I replied:</p>
               <p>"Nothing, my lord, in his manner, more than the profusion of gesture common to
                  most foreigners; and nothing on his person except a blood-mark on his right wrist
                  shaped like a cross."</p>
               <p>The Earl turned pale and shivered as though he were cold. He dropped the subject,
                  and turning toward the counter took up the rusted and crooked dagger.</p>
               <p>"I recognize this kind of weapon," said he. "This is a krees, a dagger used by the
                  Malays. I passed three months on the island of Sumatra, with my late cousin, years
                  since, and became well acquainted with their language and costume. Indeed, one
                  reason why I have proffered Mr. Fecit here the use of my library is that I learn
                  that he is fond of the study of languages. Having some pretensions to be a
                  linguist, myself, I sympathise with his pursuit."</p>
               <p>"May I presume, said my patron to ask your lordship a question?"</p>
               <p>"Do so."</p>
               <p>"The tall dark man of whom I told you, spoke to the lady in a strange <choice>
                     <sic>lenguage</sic>
                     <corr>language</corr>

                     <corr>one</corr>
                  </choice> word which seemed to have a powerful effect. It was, near as I can make
                  out the sound, diyum!"</p>
               <p>"The word, I think, is Malay. It sounds very near the word for silence in that
                  language."</p>
               <p>"Pray, my lord," said I, "is this inscription in the Malay character?" and I
                  pointed to the letters on the brooch.</p>
               <p>"No; these seem to be the rude attempts of some foreigner to form English
                  characters."</p>
               <p>After some general conversation, Captain Berkely and another officer came in the
                  shop, and his lordship, after nodding to them, turned to leave the shop,
                  accompanied to the door by the obsequious printer.</p>
               <p>"Well, old fellah," said Berkely, when the printer returned, "what was Lord
                  Toplofty doing here, eh?"</p>
               <p>"His lordship has been paying his subscription to the library, captain. Bless me,
                  if his lordship hasn't left the novel. His lordship has only gone a few steps. Run
                  after him, Ambrose, and hand it to him, with my respectful compliments."</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which I meet with the Dowager Countess, and see a strange portrait.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>His lordship kept his word as a nobleman should. Mr. Osborne, the steward, called
                  at the shop a few days afterward, and told me that I had permission to read in the
                  library of the castle at suitable hours. These suitable hours I found, upon
                  inquiry, were from three to six in the afternoon, while the family were there, and
                  at any hours I might choose when the family were away. The time first named
                  interfered with my duties in the composing-room, but Mr. Guttenberg looked upon
                  the permission as an express command from an authority not to be contemned, and
                  insisted that I should spend the time set down for me among his lordship's books.
                  I was readily obedient, for I thus had a field of study opened to me, otherwise
                  far beyond my reach. I found the library to be a full one—the rarest and finest
                  editions of new and old works occupying the shelves. It struck me that neither the
                  earl nor his visitors ever troubled the library, unless perchance to lounge there,
                  since none of the works on the shelves bore traces of frequent use. My mind did
                  not dwell on that fact. I thought only of enjoying the advantages which I
                  possessed. Among the volumes were grammars and dictionaries of all the European
                  languages, and some of Asiatic tongues, besides a few hundred of the writings of
                  various foreign authors in the original. My fondness for acquiring languages found
                  new stimulus and satisfaction, and I applied myself earnestly to a pursuit which
                  some would have called a task.</p>
               <p>Time passed for several months with little incident worthy of notice. I heard
                  nothing of Zara or her father in the meanwhile, and it was only at rare intervals
                  that they came to my memory. I was lost in my rambles through a new world. My
                  ordinary life was simply monotonous, the same round of employment in the printing
                  room or circulating library, and I made no acquaintance beyond our circle of
                  patrons, with whom I was a favorite. The officers of the regiment, through
                  Berkely, had me in to assist when they gave amateur dramatic performances, but
                  this was only an occasional amusement. The servants at the castle got to know me
                  very well, and often amused me by a bit of gossip concerning the family, or an
                  anecdote of one of its members. To all these I listened, but made no<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC6403-00000014"/> comments. I was naturally fond of talking, but I
                  was naturally prudent. This was soon discovered, and I became gradually the
                  depository of a deal of secret history, useless enough, but very amusing.</p>
               <p>Among other facts, I speedily learned that the Dowager Countess of Landys, the
                  mother of the late earl, was nearly imbecile—so much so that she was constantly
                  attended to by her maid, a woman who had been brought up in the family; and that
                  the present earl suffered her to retain the apartments she had occupied during her
                  son's life-time. She was said to have become insane on receiving the news of her
                  son's shipwreck; but the violent paroxysms ceased, leaving her mind in a state
                  approaching idiocy, and giving rise to a few harmless peculiarities. Her cousin,
                  Lady Caroline Bowlington, was the only one who had the power to interest her.
                  During her short yearly visit the countess seemed to rally, and her mind resumed
                  its normal condition. On the departure of her cousin there was an apparent
                  relapse.</p>
               <p>I also became well acquainted with the steward, Mr. Osborne. He was quite a fine
                  gentleman in manners, and had the entire confidence of his noble master. Indeed it
                  was remarked by many that the consultations between the two were conducted on a
                  footing of equality, and that the manner of the steward to the peer was that of
                  one who felt secure of his position under all circumstances. No one knew the
                  origin of this Mr. Osborne. He came when the wearer of the title succeeded to the
                  earldom, having been summoned from a distance. It was said that they traveled
                  together abroad, and had been connected for many years. People wondered how the
                  servant maintained such absolute control over the master, for it was evident that
                  the smooth, smirking and dapper gentleman lost a portion of his deferential manner
                  when conversing with his patron, and paid but little heed to the commands
                  generally put as suggestions of the latter. There was some secret in this which
                  none had been able to discover. I made no effort to penetrate it. It was no affair
                  of mine.</p>
               <p>Thus it passed until about a year after the rescue of Zara, when, as I sat one day
                  in my customary place in the library, Lord Landys entered. I rose to go, but he
                  bade me remain and be seated. He took up the book I had been reading, the
                     <title>Dejing Navodu Creskeho</title>, of Francis Palacky, and put me some
                  questions as to its contents, possibly to ascertain what progress I had made in
                  the language in which it was written. At length he said:</p>
               <p>"Do you keep up communication with your mysterious Spanish friend still, Mr.
                  Fecit?"</p>
               <p>"No, my lord," was my answer. "I have not heard of him or of his daughter, for a
                  long while."</p>
               <p>"I should have thought Mr Bagby would have kept you advised of their
                  movements."</p>
               <p>"No, my lord. He never mentions them in the occasional letters I receive from him,
                  and I suppose is as ignorant of their whereabouts as I."</p>
               <p>"Hardly since he painted the little Zara's portrait."</p>
               <p>"That was a sketch from memory, my lord. She has a striking face, apt to fix its
                  features in an artist's mind."</p>
               <p>"You are to be free of your indentures in a couple of years, I believe," continued
                  the earl. "Have you thought on your future pursuits?"</p>
               <p>"Not particularly, my lord. I shall be a printer, of course."</p>
               <p>"Your information and quickness," said he, and I rose and bowed an acknowledgment
                  of the compliment, "lift you out of that sphere of life. There are few avenues for
                  ambition in England, without the command of money and connexions, but abroad you
                  might rise rapidly."</p>
               <p>"It is possible, my lord," I replied; "but it would require means there too."</p>
               <p>"Those might be found. I have influence with the present ministry, and could
                  procure you a creditable position in India. The road there to reputation and
                  wealth is not yet choked up. At least, youth, health, talent and enterprise might
                  remove all obstacles."</p>
               <p>"I thank your lordship, but I have no desire to abandon the land where I was
                  born."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure that you were born here, at all?" was the quick reply.</p>
               <p>I was startled at the question, and the tone in which it was uttered. Before I
                  could frame an answer, he continued—</p>
               <p>"I do not mean to wound your feelings at all, but you know your own history, and
                  you might have been born in France, you know. Think on my proposition well before
                  you reject it. It gives you an opportunity which you can never have upon the soil
                  of England. But perhaps you are determined to remain here in order to investigate
                  the mystery of your birth."</p>
               <p>"No," I replied, "I have thought of that, but there seems to be no clue. The loss
                  of the packet of papers by Mr. Guttenberg is irreparable. I shall not waste time
                  in a fruitless pursuit. When I come to grapple with the world I will do it boldly,
                  and I will allow no vain object to weaken my efforts."</p>
               <p>"You are ambitious, then," said the earl, as he arose to leave the room. "Think
                  well on India—wealth and distinction."</p>
               <p>Without reflecting any more on his offers, I resumed my reading, when he had
                  retired. How long I read it is impossible to say, but I had certainly gone through
                  a great number of pages, when I heard the rustling of silk, and, looking up,
                  beheld a very old woman regarding me with apparent interest.</p>
               <p>There was something startling in the apparition.</p>
               <p>The features, from the indications presented, must at one time have been handsome;
                  age had not entirely destroyed their pleasing regularity of outline; but the soul
                  which formerly animated them was clouded. In strange contrast with the brilliant
                  black eyes, and the white hair which escaped in masses from beneath the laced cap,
                  was the vacant expression about the mouth, whose puckered lips, slightly parted,
                  disclosed the toothless gums. The old woman looked at me intently, and then
                  muttered something which I could not distinguish. This was followed by the words,
                  plainly uttered:</p>
               <p>"<emph>Her</emph> son! it must be; yes, look at the ear."</p>
               <p>I recovered from my astonishment at length, and, rising, bowed respectfully; for I
                  was sure that this was the Dowager Countess of Landys. She motioned me to resume
                  my seat, and when I hesitated, sank in a chair, and waving her hand, said in a
                  peremptory way:</p>
               <p>"Sit, sir!"</p>
               <p>I obeyed, and she still kept her eyes fixed on me, the features lighting up,<pb
                     n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6403-00000015"/> and the vacant expression quite gone. I
                  was meditating how to escape the painful scrutiny, when she spoke again, and this
                  time in a voice of tenderness:</p>
               <p>"I have not seen you for many days, my son. Why do you mourn her loss still? She
                  was not worthy of you. I told you in the beginning how it would be. Let her
                  go."</p>
               <p>I made no answer. What could I have said?</p>
               <p>"He will come again," continued the Countess, now apparently talking to herself.
                  "I know it. He will come again. What the living promised the dead would do, were
                  the body a hundred fathoms beneath the sea. The dead has never come, and the
                  living will."</p>
               <p>The interview with one thus crazed became so embarrassing that I was about to
                  escape it by flight, when the steward entered the room. The Countess glared at him
                  for a moment, rose, and walked with a haughty, and, for her years, a vigorous step
                  from the library.</p>
               <p>"Were you much disturbed, Ambrose?" inquired Osborne.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; and in some fear, though she has been here but a few minutes. It is the
                  Dowager Countess—is it not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. It is singular that she said nothing to you. She is very apt to make queer
                  remarks to strangers."</p>
               <p>"She did say something," I said, and repeated her words.</p>
               <p>"Do you understand it?" he inquired.</p>
               <p>Now, why should he ask that? Why should I understand it? Is there some secret here
                  they fear I may fathom?</p>
               <p>These were the questions that I instantly put to myself. But to Osborne I merely
                  gave a negative to his question.</p>
               <p>"She sometimes eludes the vigilance of her attendant," he said, "and goes
                  wandering about in this strange kind of way, startling visitors with all kinds of
                  queer sayings. She often fancies if she meets with a stranger that he must be her
                  son. She has never recovered the late earl's loss."</p>
               <p>"Her ladyship seems to be very old," I said.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but I merely came to get a book, and will not disturb you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Osborne selected a book from the shelves, and left the room.</p>
               <p>I resumed my study, but was doomed to another interruption. I heard the door open,
                  and on looking around, saw another stranger.</p>
               <p>The last intruder was a woman, neatly clad in black, apparently a kind of
                  domestic. She was about forty years of age, with bold, strong features, short in
                  stature, rather stout, but not fat. Her eyes were grey, and were fixed on me in
                  some surprise.</p>
               <p>"I beg pardon, sir," she said, "but I have missed the Countess Dowager, and looked
                  to see if she were here. She sometimes comes in the library."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you are her attendant then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"She was here, but left when Mr. Osborne came."</p>
               <p>"She does not like him—who does? I hope you won't think me impertinent, but pray
                  who are you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Ambrose Fecit. I am Mr. Guttenberg's apprentice and adopted son."</p>
               <p>"A printer's boy! How singular!"</p>
               <p>I was amused at the tone in which the words were uttered, and the look of wonder
                  in her face.</p>
               <p>"Pray," I inquired, "is it singular that I should be a printer's apprentice, or
                  that, being a printer's apprentice, I should be seated here?"</p>
               <p>"No, it was not that; but the likeness was so strong."</p>
               <p>"What likeness?"</p>
               <p>"Yours; you look like the portrait in the north gallery."</p>
               <p>"Whose portrait?"</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I don't know. The butler says he was a pirate. It has hung there for
                  years. The late earl brought it here. Would you like to see it?"</p>
               <p>"Very much," I replied.</p>
               <p>"Come with me, and I will show you."</p>
               <p>"But," I said, "I have only the privilege of the library, and doubt if that
                  permission extends to any other part of the castle."</p>
               <p>"Oh, the north gallery is a showroom?"</p>
               <p>"But the Countess may want you."</p>
               <p>"No, she always keeps herself alone for an hour or so after she meets a
                  stranger."</p>
               <p>I was curious to see the portrait, and so, without farther objections, I
                  accompanied the woman, who told me that her name was Gifford. She led me to the
                  north gallery, and there pointed out the portrait.</p>
               <p>Certainly the features on the canvass and my own were strikingly alike—at least as
                  far as the upper part of the face went; but the mouth in the portrait was broader,
                  and the chin heavier and squarer than mine.</p>
               <p>The portrait was a full length likeness of a man apparently about twenty-five. The
                  costume was oriental, but of what particular country in the east I could not
                  say.</p>
               <p>"You say this was a pirate," I asked, after I had looked at it well.</p>
               <p>"The butler, who served the former earl, says so," answered she. "For my part, I
                  know nothing about it. He was a foreigner of some kind. My lord sent it home from
                  abroad, when he was a young man. Before he went away for the last time he would
                  stand before the picture for hours, or rather he would walk the gallery for hours,
                  and stop every now and then before the picture, and look at it. He did not appear
                  to be fond of the man it was like, either. He would scowl at it in a way that was
                  fearful. The servants say"—and here she looked around cautiously—"that every year,
                  on the day my lord was born—that is the late earl—the picture walks."</p>
               <p>I laughed.</p>
               <p>"It is silly, I know," she said, "but there is one thing quite certain; I saw that
                  face once—whether a ghost or alive, I don't know. It was the year before my lord
                  came back the last time. I had to cross the gallery late at night. I had a candle
                  in my hand, and stopped to look at the picture as I passed. I went on, after I had
                  taken a look, and just as I reached yonder door, which was my lord's chamber, it
                  opened. As the door was kept locked always during my lord's absence, it startled
                  me a deal. I turned to look, and saw a figure wrapped in a dark cloak. My light
                  fell on the face."</p>
               <p>"Well?" said I, for she paused.</p>
               <p>"It was the face of the picture," said she. "I could not be mistaken. I dropped
                  the light and ran. The house was alarmed, and when all gathered there, the door
                  was found locked. It was opened, and as no trace could be found of any one, they
                  all said I dreamed<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6403-00000016"/> ed the matter."</p>
               <p>"What did the earl say to it when he came back?"</p>
               <p>"He never knew it. My lady, his mother, forbade any of us to tell him. But I must
                  go, lest my lady want me. You <emph>do</emph> look like the picture—very
                  much—especially that look from the eyes."</p>
               <p>And Gifford left me alone.</p>
               <p>I looked a little while longer at the portrait, and then returned to the library,
                  where I sat down, and began to think. According to Guttenberg, the man who gave me
                  in his charge was a foreigner. Could this be he? His likeness to me, too! Could he
                  have been my father? How was I to learn more of this strange portrait, and the
                  name of the original? While I was engaged in these reflections, the steward came
                  in to replace the book he had taken away.</p>
               <p>"Has the Countess Dowager been here since?"</p>
               <p>"No," I replied, "but her attendant has."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" he ejaculated. "A strange creature is Gifford—a woman of strong prejudices.
                  I have had to talk sharply to Gifford, once or twice, and she don't like me
                  much."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Osborne," I said, looking him full in the face, "there is a portrait in the
                  gallery yonder, which is said to be that of a pirate. May I ask who he was?"</p>
               <p>"Did you see it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, it is nobody; a mere fancy piece. The servants have an absurd notion that
                  it represents a pirate."</p>
               <p>"Does it not, then?"</p>
               <p>"No more than it does his lordship, or his lordship's son, or me. It was picked up
                  abroad by the late earl, I believe, at a sale somewhere on the continent. It is a
                  very odd picture, but is said to be a very good piece of painting."</p>
               <p>"The likeness to me, then, would appear to be accidental, after all?"</p>
               <p>"Entirely so."</p>
               <p>I did not believe him, and for a plain reason. The gay cloak or robe on the
                  picture was fastened by a belt, clasped by turquoises; the striped jacket was
                  buttoned at the neck, with a brooch exactly like that found in the old house in
                  the Ram's Horn; there was a crooked dagger in the sash around the waist; and on
                  the dagger's handle were several characters similar to those on the inside of the
                  ring which had been found suspended from my neck.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI.,</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein another Chip is thrown into the current of my Life, and I hear from
                     Zara.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>All these events began to shape themselves into a problem. "Who am I? What am I?"
                  were the questions to be solved. Thus it was that I frequently reviewed the
                  incidents connected with my life, and wondered whether the missing links in the
                  chain would be supplied. The facts might be connected with a common-place
                  origin—perhaps a base one, after all; still there was an air of romance about
                  them, and I was at an age when romance had full control over the mind.</p>
               <p>There was first a child with certain tokens, delivered to a printer in the town of
                  Puttenham. One of these tokens was a wedding-ring, with a singular posy; the
                  other, a packet. The packet, which I conjectured to contain the proofs of a
                  marriage, was gone, but the ring remained. Then in the house that would seem to be
                  the one where the child had been entrusted to the printer's care, certain relics
                  were found, one of which contained letters similar to those in the ring.</p>
               <p>Then the portrait in the gallery, with its strange resemblance to me, and with the
                  same sort of mysterious letters on the dagger-blade; and the singular appearance
                  of the original to Gifford.</p>
               <p>The bones in Sharp's house—were they those of the woman? Was she my mother? Had
                  she been murdered? Admitting the packet to contain evidences of marriage—a
                  conjecture—and that it were ever recovered—a remote possibility—how to identify
                  me?</p>
               <p>These questions, and others as useless, frequently occurred to me. To what end?
                  The packet was gone irrecoverably—trampled in the snow of that night—utterly
                  defaced; the mother dead; the mysterious stranger dead too, perhaps, or interested
                  in keeping silence.</p>
               <p>Suppose all elucidated. I might prove after all to be a—my face reddened then.
                  Better to be a child of mystery than of shame. And yet the questions would come
                  again—"Who am I? What am I?"</p>
               <p>Time went on in the meanwhile. I studied hard at the earl's books, and each step
                  made the next easier. The people of the town thought me a prodigy of learning, and
                  I was not displeased with the vulgar admiration. I had vanity—who has not? and it
                  was tickled. No foreigner, high or low, ever entered the town, but my name was
                  mentioned to him, and we were speedily brought in contact. I was, beyond dispute,
                  the great linguist of Puttenham. This was of service to me. I acquired greater
                  colloquial intercourse with several modern languages, and ease of manner. The
                  municipal dignitaries honored me with their nod; and even the proud Earl of Landys
                  condescended to speak of me as a remarkable boy. With the military officers, and
                  the patrons of the library, I still continued to be a favorite. As I was tall for
                  my age, well-knit, and with handsome features, the young ladies of the place
                  looked on me pleasantly, and the matrons with a forbidding air. For you see I was
                  nobody; my very name was not my own; and, though Mr. Guttenberg had adopted me, I
                  might not be co-heir with his daughter after all. I was not a desirable match in
                  the eyes of prudent mothers, among the trades-folk of the town.</p>
               <p>A strange kind of friendship sprang up between me and Gifford. She would often
                  slip into the library when I was there, and interrupt my reading with
                  reminiscences of the Landys family, of whose history she was a walking chronicle.
                  I asked her but few questions, contenting myself with playing the part of a
                  listener; but there were two points on which I wished to be enlightened. One was
                  about the portrait that Bagby mentioned as resembling Espinel; the other what the
                  dowager countess meant, if there was any meaning to the words, by saying: "The
                  dead has not come, and the living will."</p>
               <p>Gifford readily answered both questions.</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about the picture. I recollect there was one in my lord's chamber,
                  such as you describe, but it has been removed, I think. As for her<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC6403-00000017"/> ladyship's words, they refer to a promise of her
                  son. The old lady believes in spirits coming back to this world and appearing to
                  their friends, if they want to. Why shouldn't she? You do, don't you?"</p>
               <p>As Gifford evidently did, and I had no desire to discuss the point, I said
                  evasively:</p>
               <p>"Oh, that point is settled among all sensible people; but I don't see what that
                  has to do with the words."</p>
               <p>"Why, you see, the late earl was very fond of his mother, and she of him. Somehow
                  he never believed in ghosts and such things—though there was a spirit in the
                  family once—I'll tell you about that some other time; and they used to dispute
                  about it a good deal, only in a good-natured way. I was busy doing something one
                  day in the countess's chamber, and her son was there, and they'd been talking over
                  the matter. Said his lordship, said he:</p>
               <p>"'We'll settle the matter practically, mother. If I die before you, and am able to
                  do so, I will come to see you after death, and let you know how I like the other
                  world; and you shall do the same with me.'</p>
               <p>"The countess she spoke up and said, says she:</p>
               <p>"'That I solemnly promise to do, George.'</p>
               <p>"Now as he has never made his appearance to her, and she knows he would keep his
                  word, that's what she means by saying that the dead hadn't come, and the living
                  would."</p>
               <p>"But," said I, "there can be no doubt of the earl's death."</p>
               <p>"It seems not, but her ladyship don't believe it."</p>
               <p>One thing Gifford was not communicative upon—her own history; but I learned that
                  from others. She was an orphan child, reared by the dowager countess's direction,
                  and in due time promoted to be her maid. Despite her apparent love of tattling,
                  she was close in regard to some things, and was, beyond doubt, the confidante of
                  her noble mistress. What she said to me, therefore, I at once divined was not
                  meant to be a secret, at least from me.</p>
               <p>Beside Gifford, I made another friend, and a very singular one, about this time.
                  The reader will remember that the old house in the Ram's Horn belonged to one
                  Sharp. This Sharp, whose Christian name was Abner, was a singular character. No
                  man was more generally execrated and abhorred by his townsmen. He was a thin,
                  pinched, cadaverous old man, apparently about sixty, with a high and narrow
                  forehead, a thin nose, ornamented with a knob, like a mighty pimple, at the tip,
                  and a round, long chin. His eyes were small, keen and restless, keeping up an
                  uneasy motion all the while; and he had a remarkable and noted habit of casting
                  alarmed glances from time to time over his shoulder. He was said to be enormously
                  rich, owning houses upon houses, holding bonds and mortgages innumerable, and
                  loaning money at usurious interest. Yet he was so parsimonious that he denied
                  himself necessary food and proper clothing; and he lived in the garret of one of
                  his own houses, the other floors being let to the poorest class of people. This
                  Sharp I knew by sight very well, as did every one else in town, and I had had at
                  times some conversation with him. He owned the house and premises which Mr.
                  Guttenberg occupied, and used to come on quarter day, exactly on the stroke of
                  twelve, to receive his rent. He was also the proprietor of the Museum of the town,
                  a place got up by a Yankee speculator, as a resort for the people of the
                  surrounding country, on holidays; but which proved to be a failure. However such a
                  thing might do in America, it failed here; but Sharp had taken it in lieu of a
                  debt, and it became his only apparent delight. He used to gloat over its quaint
                  treasures, its mummies, stuffed beasts, stones and butterflies; its pickled heads
                  of New Zealanders, birds and wax figures. Nay, he even expended money on it, not
                  only buying any double-headed calf, or four-legged chicken that came along, but
                  absolutely going to some expense by advertising each new possession in the
                     <title>Puttenham Chronicle</title>, and having placards printed to post upon
                  dead walls and pumps, and to place in the tap-rooms. Through his visits to the
                  printing-room, I came to know Sharp tolerably well, and as I treated him with a
                  sort of patronizing deference, we became quite familiar. The truth is that I
                  pitied the poor wretch in spite of his large possessions, and felt commisseration
                  for the miserable being who, in the midst of wealth, felt the pangs of poverty. He
                  returned this by a number of parsimonious proverbs, and much good moneymaking
                  advice. There was no obligation incurred on either side. Each could well spare
                  what he parted with, and the gifts given were not of the least use to the
                  recipients.</p>
               <p>A striking incident made us quite intimate.</p>
               <p>One day in winter, the quarter-day, Sharp came to collect his rent. The weather
                  was more damp than cold; the snow which had fallen the night before had melted,
                  and when Sharp entered he presented a pitiable sight. His face looked blue, with
                  the exception of his nose, which glowed like the tip of a carbuncle, and he
                  trembled with weakness and cold. He was thinly clad, as usual, without a
                  great-coat, and his patched shoes had evidently not kept out the snow-water. I
                  offered him the loan of my great-coat, but he declined it, saying that he had a
                  very excellent wrapper of his own, which he had forgotten to put on in the
                  morning. Toward night-fall he came to the printing-room again, on his way home,
                  and stood by the grate to dry his feet and warm himself. He looked even more ill
                  than before, and I renewed the offer of the great coat.</p>
               <p>"No!" he answered sharply, "I've one of my own, I tell you. "Besides," he added,
                  more pleasantly, "you might want to go out to-night; and I might injure your coat
                  too."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" I said, "I know you'll take care of it; you never injure any thing
                  that costs money, and as I'm not going out to-night, I shan't want it. You'll be
                  ill if you don't take it; and if you do wear it out a little, that's no matter. As
                  I'm not quite so rich as you, I'm not so close."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" he muttered, "wilful waste makes woeful want. If I were to be as extravagant
                  as you I'd soon be a beggar. It's very comfortable though," he continued, as he
                  put it on, "and wadded, too. A printer's apprentice with such a coat as this. Dear
                  me! West of England cloth, at that. Why don't you wear shoddy? Your master allows
                  you this, eh? He'll never be rich—never!"</p>
               <p>And off he went, grumbling.</p>
               <p>That night at supper I mentioned<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6403-00000018"/> the
                  occurrence laughingly to the family.</p>
               <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Guttenberg, "what a mean man he is; and so rich. To be
                  sure, he was poor enough once—a wild spendthrift."</p>
               <p>"<emph>He</emph> a spendthrift, mother! That's the last I should expect to hear of
                     <emph>him</emph>. Why he might stand to a sculptor for a model of Avarice. It
                  seems to have been born with him."</p>
               <p>"It was in the blood, that's a fact," said the old woman, "but he was a
                  spendthrift at first; and his father threatened to disinherit him. The old man
                  would have done it, too, everybody said; but he died suddenly, and there was no
                  will found, so, as Abner was an only son, he fell heir to about ten thousand
                  pounds."</p>
               <p>"Which he has screwed and scraped, and swelled into a hundred thousand at least,"
                  said Mr. Guttenberg. "When his father died he cut loose from his riotous
                  companions, and for forty years he has been a miserable, sordid, griping miser,
                  without a friend in the world."</p>
               <p>"He is much to be pitied then," I said.</p>
               <p>"I do not pity him," said Mary. "He is a mean old hunks; and I don't believe
                  you'll get your coat again, Ambrose."</p>
               <p>"He was wiser in one thing than you, my boy," said Mr. Guttenberg, "for you really
                  will want your coat tonight. He signed the receipt I wrote for the rent, and by
                  mistake I have made it up to the end of the coming quarter. It is very odd that he
                  did not notice the blunder. I wish you would go to his lodgings and have the error
                  corrected at once. Here is the old receipt, and a new one stamped. You can run
                  along fastly, so you wont need any overcoat while you're going; and you can get
                  your own to return in."</p>
               <p>"Won't the morning do as well?" inquired his wife.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! As the old fellow would say himself, 'never put off till to-morrow what
                  you can do to-day.' Ambrose rather likes the errand, I dare say."</p>
               <p>"Of course I do," I answered. "I want to see how the old miser lives at home." And
                  without further words I took the receipt and started.</p>
               <p>I cantered along briskly through the sloppy, half-melted snow, to the house where
                  old Sharp had his den. Like many other of his buildings, it was in a dilapidated
                  condition. I knocked at the door, and after considerable delay it was opened by a
                  half-grown girl, who held a flaring tallow candle over her head with one hand,
                  while she kept the door half closed with the other.</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" she inquired.</p>
               <p>"I wish to see Mr. Sharp on particular business," I answered.</p>
               <p>"I don't know that he'll want to see you. He never does business after dark. Who
                  are you?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Fecit, and I come from Mr. Guttenberg."</p>
               <p>"Oh," said the girl, after scrutinizing me closely, "I know you. You can go up to
                  his room, but I don't think you'll get in. He bolts up at dark, and won't speak to
                  way one. It's the topmost room of the house. You can't miss it. You can take this
                  light, and leave it on the stair-head."</p>
               <p>I took the candle, and made my way up the creaking staircase to the garret. I
                  knocked at the door, but there was no reply made. I tried the knob, and to my
                  surprise the door opened.</p>
               <p>I entered.</p>
               <p>I had never seen a room so meanly furnished containing so many tokens of wealth
                  There was a heavy iron box, a wooden chest of drawers, a table covered with
                  papers, jewelry and money, and a pallet. The windows were furnished with iron
                  bars, and there were three bolts to the door, and a chain. Around the room in a
                  confused litter were articles of vertu, piles of handsomely bound books, beautiful
                  pictures, and an old suit of armor. Hanging on hooks in the walls were several
                  curious swords and two pairs of pistols, richly mounted. Upon a large silver
                  salver, which lay on the chest of drawers, were a number of pieces of plate, and
                  on the corner of the table lay a diamond-studded snuff-box. As a sort of mockery
                  of the valuables, there was a wooden platter in the midst of the table, containing
                  a crust of bread and a red herring. The supper had been untouched.</p>
               <p>I turned toward the pallet. Sharp, still wrapped in my great-coat, lay upon it,
                  breathing heavily. I shook him, but there was no answer. He did not recognize me.
                  I felt his pulse—it scarcely beat. His head was hot, but his feet were cold as
                  ice. I ran to the door and called down the stairs. Some of the inmates of the
                  rooms put their heads out from their doors, among the rest the girl who had
                  admitted me.</p>
               <p>"Send some one for the nearest doctor," I said, "Mr. Sharp is quite unwell. And
                  bring me some hot water, somebody. I'd be obliged to any one who'd go for Mr.
                  Guttenberg." They were all for entering the room, but I kept them back. As soon as
                  I had pacified them I threw some old clothes over the money and valuables that
                  were exposed to view, so that when the girl came with the hot water there was
                  nothing in sight of which she could babble to excite the cupidity of her
                  hearers.</p>
               <p>I removed Sharp's shoes. His feet were icily cold. I propped him half upright in
                  the pallet, and placed his feet in the hot water. I then opened the dormer window,
                  and obtaining some snow from the roof, made a temporary bag of my handkerchief,
                  and placing the snow in it, applied it to his head. These simple measures soon had
                  their effect. The pulse began to beat more quickly and firmly; the temperature of
                  the body became more even, and the breathing grew natural. At length Sharp
                  recognised me.</p>
               <p>"What are you doing here?" he asked, endeavoring to rise. He was too weak,
                  however, and fell back again.</p>
               <p>"You can let him lie down now," I said to the girl who was aiding me. "Go down
                  stairs, and when the doctor and Mr. Guttenberg come, show them up at once."</p>
               <p>The girl left the room. Sharp looked at me in wonder.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" he asked. "I don't want a doctor. He'll ruin me."</p>
               <p>"Pray be quiet," I said. "You are very ill, and must have a doctor. He'll be here
                  presently."</p>
               <p>"I won't pay him. I didn't send for him—mind that."</p>
               <p>"Very well; we won't quarrel on that score. A doctor is necessary, and if you
                  won't pay for him I will."</p>
               <p>"You can't; you haven't the money; you're only a prentice boy. What's your
                  business here, anyhow? Do you think you'll get any money from me?"</p>
               <p>I was thoroughly provoked, but I<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6403-00000019"/> kept my
                  temper, as there was no use of quarreling with such a madman. So I told him my
                  errand there. It seemed to calm him at first, but at the next moment he glanced
                  uneasily at the table.</p>
               <p>"All right," I said, in answer to his look. "I threw those clothes on the table
                  and chest, that the girl's prying eyes might not fall on the money and plate you
                  had left exposed."</p>
               <p>"It was thoughtful," he said, after a moment's pause. "I must trust some one—why
                  not you? Take those keys from under my pillow; there, pick only the second-sized
                  one from the bunch; open the chest, and put the money and jewelry away."</p>
               <p>I obeyed him, locked the chest, and returned the key. I had scarcely done this
                  when the doctor entered, closely followed by Mr. Guttenberg. The doctor wasn't a
                  physician; he was not a regular M. D., but what in Puttenham is called an
                  apothecary. In London he would have styled himself a general practitioner. He was
                  of some eminence in his profession, and bore the reputation of being a very worthy
                  man.</p>
               <p>"I didn't send for you," said Sharp, when he saw him. "Remember, if you prescribe
                  I won't pay you. I call Mr. Guttenberg to witness."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gray, the doctor, smiled, and asked me the history of the case. I told him how
                  I had found the old man, and what I had done.</p>
               <p>"You couldn't have done better if you had been the whole Royal College of
                  Surgeons," said Mr. Gray. "You have probably saved his life. Without your prompt
                  action, the congestion of the brain might have been fatal."</p>
               <p>"Do you think he saved my life?" inquired Sharp, leaning on his elbow, and peering
                  in the doctor's face.</p>
               <p>"I think it very probable."</p>
               <p>"Well, well!" exclaimed the miser, "I suppose I ought to be much obliged to him.
                  But he isn't a regular practitioner; he can't make me pay."</p>
               <p>The air of the old man as he said this was so absurdly earnest, that we all burst
                  into a simultaneous peal of laughter. Sharp looked annoyed, but the next instant
                  his features relaxed into a faint smile.</p>
               <p>"I am well enough now, at all events," said he, "and I don't want any one here
                  now."</p>
               <p>The doctor told him that he was not well enough at all, and that it was necessary
                  some one should remain with him during the night, to carry out the directions
                  left.</p>
               <p>"I won't have any one here," persisted Sharp.</p>
               <p>"But you must," reiterated the doctor.</p>
               <p>"If Ambrose will stay, he may; but I'll have no one else," returned the miser.</p>
               <p>I looked at Mr. Guttenberg inquiringly. He nodded his head.</p>
               <p>"Very well," I said, "I'll stay."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gray told me what medicines he should send, how to administer them, and what
                  to do in case certain unfavorable symptoms came on. Then off he went, and Mr.
                  Guttenberg with him. Previous to the departure of the latter, he handed me a
                  letter.</p>
               <p>"This came," said he, "during the afternoon. I forgot to hand it you at supper.
                  We'll keep your breakfast ready for you in the morning."</p>
               <p>I was left alone with my strange charge. I turned towards him. He was fast asleep.
                  I found a couple of tallow candles in a tin box, and laid them in readiness by the
                  candlestick; put some of the books that were scattered about on the table to read
                  during the night; took the medicine from the doctor's boy, who had now come,
                  awakened my patient and gave him the powder according to directions, and then sat
                  down to read my letter.</p>
               <p>It was from Paul Bagby, and read as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"<hi rend="i"/>My dear Ambrose:—Read this letter as carefully as you like, and
                     then—burn it.</p>
                  <p>"Zara is in my charge—<emph>where</emph> you will learn some day by word of
                     mouth. I dare not, for her sake, write it, lest some accident should befall
                     this letter.</p>
                  <p>"Espinel, who is a Spanish nobleman, and her uncle, has disappeared. He has
                     been either killed or abducted; which I cannot say.</p>
                  <p>"Keep all this secret. What I desire you to do for me, and for Zara's sake, is
                     to ascertain, without provoking remark, if Mr. Osborne left the castle
                     recently. If so, when, how long he was absent, and whether he has now
                     returned.</p>
                  <p>"The blow at Zara comes from that quarter. I would like to tell you all; but
                     this is not the proper place nor time. I shall see you shortly if I can leave
                     London.</p>
                  <p>"Make some excuse for examining the records of the parish-church of St.
                     Stephen. See the marriage-register, and get me the exact date of the marriage
                     of the present Earl of Landys with Miss Ansleigh. I wish to see if it
                     corresponds with the statement in Burke's peerage."</p>
               </q>
               <p>I read the letter twice, and tearing it in strips, consumed them one by one in the
                  flame of the candle.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.,</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Which contains singular revelations, and tells of the growth of an odd
                     friendship.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I was musing over the contents of the letter, when I heard Sharp speak. I went to
                  the pallet. The old man's eyes were staring wildly, their whites injected with
                  blood, and his face deeply flushed. The fever, as the doctor had warned me, had
                  evidently come on. It was with some difficulty I could get him to swallow the
                  draught sent for such an exigency.</p>
               <p>He lay there restlessly tossing about, while I paced up and down the room,
                  striving to keep myself warm. There was a grate, indeed, at the chimney-place, but
                  it was quite empty, and it was too late in the night to order coals. All I could
                  do to defend myself against the cold was to keep myself in motion.</p>
               <p>The rustling noise of Sharp's movements stopped. I turned to look at him. He was
                  sitting erect on the bed, his eyes dilated and almost starting from their sockets
                  with terror.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" he cried, in a tone of horror that made my very flesh creep, "there he is,
                  cold and stiff; and he is my father! Have I murdered him? Take him away! Take him
                  away!"</p>
               <p>Was this, then, the terrible secret of the old man's life, or was it the creation
                  of the fever?</p>
               <p>"There! there!" he said, "they are coming—for me! There is the gallows! and the
                  rope—how it dangles and swings! The hangman—I see <emph>him!</emph> and the crowd!
                  how they yell and howl! Oh, God! how they yell!"</p>
               <p>This, then, I thought, was the cause of those watchful glances which he cast over
                  his shoulder from time to time as he walked—this was the spectre that haunted
                  him.</p>
               <p>I hoisted the window again, obtained some snow, and applied it to his head.</p>
               <p>"Heavens!" I said, as I was thus engaged, "is this miserable old man a
                  parricide?"</p>
               <p>He caught at the word.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6403-00000020"/>
               <p>"Parricide!" he exclaimed. "No, my lord, and you, gentlemen of the jury, I did not
                  mean to murder him. No; mean and cold and cruel as he was to me, he was still my
                  father. Murder!—me! Why I would not harm a worm. I meant to rob; yes, I meant to
                  help myself from his hoard; for she—she was starving—dying of want—and he spurned
                  me from him—he would not give me a farthing to save her—her! my poor Margaret!
                  Yes! I was a spendthrift—a reckless young man; but I was a husband! I thought to
                  make him sleep the sounder that I might get the keys. He slept, and he never awoke
                  again. Ah! the money came too late! too late! my poor Margaret was dead!"</p>
               <p>I still applied the snow, and he calmed under it, but his fancies were busy with
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Yes! I know—he died of disease of the heart—they said his death was sudden; but
                  did not the laudanum hasten it? He comes at night," he murmured, "at night, when
                  all is still, and sits and looks at me with his cold eyes and pale face; he tells
                  me that I have his money; but I have no Margaret—and then he goes to only come
                  back again—again—again. You are there now, and your touch is cold as ice."</p>
               <p>"It is I, Ambrose Fecit," I said. "Don't you know me?"</p>
               <p>"But I wonder what is in the packet," he continued. "Shall I open it? I think
                  not."</p>
               <p>I renewed the snow application to his head.</p>
               <p>"My poor Margaret!" he said. "She is dead, and I have nothing to love now but
                  gold—gold—gold! I am rich—they do not know how rich I am; but I atone; yes, I
                  atone. Men hate and despise me for a miser. They'll never know me better; but the
                  grave will cover me, and then the worms will find it out—ha! ha! the worms will
                  find it out!"</p>
               <p>It was a trying position for one of my age to fill—alone in a cold and cheerless
                  room, in the dead hours of the night, listening to the ravings of a remorseful
                  man, whose sensitive conscience, excited by disease, exaggerated his crime, and
                  unmasked his soul to a stranger. What he meant by saying that he atoned, I could
                  not even conceive. His sordid life, his denial of pity and kindness to others, and
                  even to himself, was a worse crime than the robbery of his father. The one was
                  prompted by the suffering of his wife; the other had no palliation. But with these
                  and other thoughts within me, I still sat there applying the cooling snow to his
                  head, and administering his hourly draught. Two or three hours more of raving and
                  delirium passed, and then he sank into an uneasy slumber. I gathered what spare
                  clothes I could find around, and muffling myself in these to secure a portion of
                  warmth, I took up one of the books on the table, and sat down to read. With the
                  exception of once, when he awakened, and took the draught ready for him, I
                  remained thus until long after the grey streaks of dawn had stolen through the
                  dusty window-panes.</p>
               <p>He did not wake until after nine o'clock. He was evidently much better; his skin
                  was moist and his mind clear, though his body was weak. He looked at me
                  curiously.</p>
               <p>"I have been very sick, have I not?" he inquired at length.</p>
               <p>"Yes," I answered, "you have had a high fever during the greater part of the
                  night, talking all sorts of nonsense, and seeing all kinds of dead people."</p>
               <p>He looked a little alarmed.</p>
               <p>"What did I say?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, you saw your father, and told me all about him."</p>
               <p>I fixed my eyes on him closely and curiously as I said this. He did not seem so
                  discomposed as I expected.</p>
               <p>"Tell me what I said."</p>
               <p>I repeated it nearly word for word.</p>
               <p>"Well," he said, when I had done, "do you think me a murderer, or was it the
                  fever?"</p>
               <p>"I am willing to put down two-thirds, at least to the fever."</p>
               <p>He raised himself up.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," said he, "that you've been sitting there without fire all night,
                  and your great coat on me? Why didn't you get it?"</p>
               <p>"I couldn't well disturb you for such a purpose. I got along very well."</p>
               <p>"Help me off with it now. There, there. You ought to whisk it well. It is full of
                  lint. The brush never injures clothing so much as dust. Remember that. You should
                  never have suffered me to lie in your coat. It injures a coat very much. You'll
                  never be rich, if you're so extravagant."</p>
               <p>"Why, you miserable old man!" I exclaimed, provoked at his folly, "do you suppose
                  great coats were not made to be of service? I wouldn't have your feelings for ten
                  times your money."</p>
               <p>"And the doctor said you saved my life; I remember that. And yet you despise
                  me."</p>
               <p>"You despise yourself. As for me I only despise your parsimony. Do you think
                  people can respect any man who walks through life alone, doing no good to kin or
                  kind?"</p>
               <p>"I have no kin, and men are not of my kind."</p>
               <p>"God forbid they were," I said to myself.</p>
               <p>He seemed to read my thoughts by his remark.</p>
               <p>"Shall I tell you my secret, then?"</p>
               <p>"As you choose about that. I covet no more confidence than you have already given
                  me without intending it."</p>
               <p>"I will tell you. I have watched you before this. You have prudence and discretion
                  beyond your years; and I would sooner trust you than graver and older men. Your
                  feelings are fresh yet—you will understand me."</p>
               <p>The old man evidently could not repress the desire to pour out his whole history,
                  and I sat there and listened.</p>
               <p>Parsimony ran in the blood. His father, Jacob Sharp, had acquired a fortune of
                  twenty thousand pounds, by saving and pinching. Abner was brought up to his
                  father's trade, that of a silver-smith, and became an expert workman; but the
                  family taste for hoarding did not at first betray itself in him. On the contrary,
                  his vice ran the other way. Young Abner spent as fast, and faster than he earned,
                  to the great disgust of the father; and to add to the chagrin and anger of the
                  latter, the son fell in love and married a poor orphan girl. The elder Sharp grew
                  furious at this last act of folly, turned his son out of doors, and swore he never
                  would see his daughter-in-law. Abner grew more prudent in money matters, but an
                  accident to his right hand threw him out of work, his surplus means were soon
                  exhausted, and he and his wife were reduced to want. She, indeed, obtained a
                  pittance by sewing, but fell sick, more through hunger than disease, and
                     languished.<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6403-00000021"/> Abner made up his mind to
                  rob his father of a sufficient sum to pay the passage of himself and wife to
                  America, where he believed he could get employment. Now, old Sharp, in spite of
                  his avarice, indulged in one luxury, namely, a night-cap of old ale before he went
                  to bed. Into this night draught Abner managed to pour some laudanum, a dose of
                  which he had in the house. It was not an overdose by any means, but it set the
                  miser soundly asleep. The son obtained the keys, helped himself to sufficient
                  money from a spot where he knew it would not be missed for awhile, and left the
                  house. The next morning, while he was preparing to leave for Liverpool, word was
                  brought him that his father had been found dead in his chair. The coroner's jury,
                  on the evidence of the surgeons who made a post-mortem examination of the body,
                  rendered a verdict of "Death from disease of the heart;" but Abner was filled with
                  the belief that the dose of laudanum had hastened his father's death. Hence the
                  remorseful feelings which embittered his life. He succeeded to the father's
                  property as heir-at-law, but all the money came too late for his wife, who died
                  the day after his father. From that time the family propensity broke out on him
                  fiercely; he gave himself up totally to the accumulation of money, and for forty
                  years had devoted his energy, backed by unmitigated parsimony, to gain.</p>
               <p>"Young man," said he, when he had closed his story, "I owe you my life. I am not
                  ungrateful. I will show you more of myself than the world knows. You shall not
                  entirely despise me. Hitherto I have had no particular care for one human being
                  beyond another, and no one has cared for me; but I can confide in you. I like you.
                  If you will promise not to reveal it, I will acquaint you with a secret."</p>
               <p>"As you choose. I do not cove your confidence, as I told you before but if your
                  secret be one I can honor ably keep, I'll hear it."</p>
               <p>He arose, and I assisted him to arrange his dress. He went to the iron chest where
                  I had placed his money and jewelry, and took out a book.</p>
               <p>"No one but myself," said he, "has ever looked at these entries. The book will be
                  destroyed when I feel death approaching. Before you examine it, let me tell you
                  something. You remember that James Meadows, the carpenter, was burned out last
                  spring?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"His tools, his household furniture, the clothing of the family, everything he had
                  was destroyed. He and his family barely escaped with their lives. They were in
                  great distress. Every one pitied them, and the pity took the substantial shape of
                  one pound, fourteen shillings and nine pence."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken," I said, "fifty pounds were sent by an unknown hand from
                  London. On this Meadows commenced his work again, and is doing well. There was one
                  good Samaritan."</p>
               <p>"No; it was merely the payment due from discriminating wealth to honest industry
                  crippled by misfortune. Meadows was an honest and industrious man, and the fire
                  came through no carelessness of his. He was my tenant, and I lost a house by it—a
                  loss only partly made up by the insurance. The money came from me through my
                  London bankers."</p>
               <p>"From you!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, from me. I sent it with a written charge to Meadows that he should repay the
                  unknown lender, by sending anonymously, from time to time, as he could afford it,
                  small sums of money to poor and honest persons in distress. I hope and believe
                  that he will be honest enough to pay the debt in that way."</p>
               <p>I was much astonished at the statement, but more so when I glanced over the book
                  which he placed in my hand. It was a record extending over many years, of sums
                  secretly sent to needy persons, running from hundreds of pounds down to a few
                  shillings, and amounted in the aggregate to a heavy sum.</p>
               <p>How the world misjudged this man! But it was not the world's fault. I handed him
                  back the book.</p>
               <p>"You have promised to keep my secret," said he. "I spend nothing on myself; but I
                  have on others for many years, wherever I think it deserved. It is my only relief
                  from the terrible remorse that weighs me down. But it makes no diminution to my
                  income. Everything I touch prospers. Even that ridiculous Museum, which ruined its
                  former owner, yields me a handsome profit. By the by, you must visit that. Your
                  name will be left with the doorkeeper. You will find a deal to interest you there.
                  Come when you like—but not if it wastes your time. Time is money—remember
                  that."</p>
               <p>The doctor came, pronounced the patient all right, and so I went off to my
                  breakfast, leaving Sharp, for all I knew, to luxuriate on the red herring left
                  from the night before.</p>
               <p>From this date began my intimacy with old Sharp. Every one was amused and amazed
                  when they heard of it, attributing it to the fact of my nursing him all night
                  through his illness. People thought that the "old wretch," as they called him, had
                  one redeeming trait in his character. Captain Berkeley told me, before a crowd of
                  the officers, that I had bound myself apprentice to Sharp to learn the art of
                  making money; and Tom Brown called us "Sharp &amp; Co." But all that wore off, and
                  people found other topics for discussion. I used occasionally to drop in at the
                  Museum, and sometimes I would meet the old man there. Then he came to the
                  printing-room more frequently. One way or other I saw a good deal of him.</p>
               <p>He never lost an opportunity to impress on me lessons of economy, or modes of
                  making money, all of which I listened to without reply. One piece of advice I
                  took, however. I was looking at the collection of minerals in the Museum, during a
                  half hour's leisure at noon, when he came in.</p>
               <p>"Do you understand mineralogy or geology?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"No! I scarcely know one mineral from another."</p>
               <p>"Learn both those sciences. The knowledge might be profitable sometime. Even a
                  smattering is better than nothing. I picked up some knowledge of the kind when I
                  was working at my trade, and that enabled me to tell gozzin when I saw it, and so
                  I was led to buy the Bury property. I afterwards sold the mining right for
                  twenty-five thousand pounds."</p>
               <p>I never expected to find a copper-mine, but I had a thirst for knowledge of all
                  sorts; and, aided by elementary works, with the collection at the museum, and the
                  geological features of the<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6403-00000022"/>

               <argument>
                  <p>Which tells of the Entertainments at the Castle, and of a Finale not
                     Rehearsed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>It was within a few weeks of the term of twenty-one years from the time I was
                  first placed in the hands of John Guttenberg, when the events occurred which I am
                  about to relate.</p>
               <p>There were always a large number of visitors at Landys Castle during the Christmas
                  holidays, when the family was there; but this year there were even more than ever
                  before, for the Countess, an invalid, was in much better health than usual, and
                  sometimes drove out to take an airing accompanied by her little boy. I had
                  frequently seen her at the Castle, a pale, thin young lady, who had been a blonde
                  beauty, but who was wrecked by ill-health. Her ladyship had recently so far
                  recovered her strength as to occasion great rejoicing among her friends; and the
                  Earl, who appeared to be a fond husband, did his best to minister to her
                  amusement. Among other matters devised to add to the pleasure of the season, it
                  was proposed to get up an amateur dramatic performance, and the manager of a
                  circuit of provincial theatres not far from London was sent for to supervise the
                  affair. It was found, however, even after obtaining the aid of the army officers
                  in town that there was not available material for casting a tragedy—a fortunate
                  thing for the tragedy and the audience—so they settled upon the old comedy of "The
                  Poor Gentleman," which they fell to rehearsing with great earnestness. The little
                  programmes of the play were printed at our establishment, and I noted that Captain
                  Berkeley, a very clever amateur as I knew, was set down for the part of Frederick
                  Bramble; the Honorable Mr. Wickham, and M. P. for the county, as Doctor Ollapod,
                  and the Honorable Mrs. Leigh for Emily Worthington. The Emily of the occasion was
                  a young, rich, and fashionable widow, very popular in the town, on account of her
                  beauty and affability, and the dextrous manner in which she drove her own phaeton
                  through the streets on her visits. I knew, as I said, that Berkeley was clever,
                  but I marvelled at his choice, Dr. Ollapod being his specialty, as Frederick had
                  been mine, but I saw that it was done to oblige his noble host. I, of course,
                  never expected to witness, much less to partake in these performances; for I would
                  not stand among lackeys, and though the proud Earl of Landys might allow a
                  printer's boy the use of his library, to receive him as a guest was another
                  matter.</p>
               <p>And yet I did participate, nevertheless.</p>
               <p>The day before the evening set for the performance, Captain Berkeley came to the
                  printing-room in company with a stranger whom he introduced as Mr. Haresfoot, the
                  manager.</p>
               <p>This new acquaintance was a man about forty years old, tall and inclining to
                  stoutness, with a rubicund face, a slightly pompous manner, and a shuffling walk,
                  as though he were moving about in Turkish slippers. He had a ridiculous habit of
                  emphasizing or rather punctuating his sentences, by closing and opening first one
                  eye and then the other, like a sportsman taking aim at his game from either
                  shoulder alternately—a curious feat, which I tried afterwards to imitate by way of
                  amusement, but found it to be to me physically impossible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hincks was absent and I was managing the <title>Chronicle</title> in his
                  stead—having been sub-editor for some time. I was knee-deep in a pile of
                  newspapers, from which I had been clipping and arranging paragraphs; but I gave my
                  visitors seats when they entered, and waited to hear what they had to say, for
                  their manner spoke of business.</p>
               <p>Captain Berkeley introduced his companion.</p>
               <p>"Happy to make your acquaintance, sir," said Haresfoot, winking his left eye. "I
                  have come down here to act as director to the amateur entertainment at the castle,
                  at Captain Berkely's request"—here the right eye was put through its exercise—"but
                  we find ourselves at the last moment in some trouble, from which I am told you can
                  extricate us." And then both eyes opened and shut alternately.</p>
               <p>I looked my astonishment.</p>
               <p>"You must know, then, Ambrose," said the Captain, "we cast the 'Poor Gentleman'
                  very nicely indeed, and were getting along famously, when Wickham receives news of
                  his uncle's alarming illness in Yorkshire—"</p>
               <p>"The said uncle personating twenty thousand a year," interrupted Haresfoot, "and
                  valuable props."</p>
               <p>"And off he posts," continued Berkeley. "I am up in Ollapod"—</p>
               <p>"And down on it," again interrupted the manager</p>
               <p>"Oh, be quiet, will you! We have nobody to play Frederic, and reading a part is a
                  bore. You have played it for us more cleverly than I should. I mentioned that to
                  the Earl and ladies, and told them I thought you might be induced to do it, under
                  the circumstances. So Haresfoot and myself were commissioned to say they would
                  feel obliged if you would oblige them."</p>
               <p>"Captain," said Haresfoot, "that was very well done. If you sell out and want
                  employment come to me. You shall announce all the new plays, and make apologies to
                  the audience when my leading man has set too late to dinner, and my leading woman
                  has a fit of the sulks."</p>
               <p>"Oh, bother!" cried the Captain. "What do you say?"</p>
               <p>"Well," I replied, "I'd be very happy to do so; but why couldn't Mr. Haresfoot
                  fill the gap?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," said the manager, winking his left eye, "that would never do." Snap went the
                  right eye. "I should only mar the—well, the unity of the performance."</p>
               <p>Berkeley laughed.</p>
               <p>"That, translated into plain <choice>
                     <sic>Enlish</sic>
                     <corr>English</corr>
                  </choice>," said he, "means that he thinks we are a set of muffs. Won't we show
                  him? But what do you say, my fine fellah?"</p>
               <p>"My time is not at my own disposal quite. You must ask Mr. Guttenberg."</p>
               <p>"Oh, if that's all, we'll expect you at rehearsal at twelve o'clock
                  to-morrow—twelve o'clock, sharp! Not your friend of the money-bags, though."</p>
               <p>The chuckle that broke from Haresfoot at this miserable attempt at pleasantry by
                  Berkeley, showed that the latter had been talking to the former about me, and
                  served to embarass me<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6403-00000023"/> a little. After
                  some little conversation on indifferent subjects, they bid me good-day, and with a
                  nod to Tom Brown, now our foreman, who had just come in with some proof-slips,
                  left the room.</p>
               <p>Tom had an enquiring look on his face, so I told him their errand.</p>
               <p>"Now there's luck!" cried he enviously. "Here you, a prentice, get an invitation
                  to the castle among the nobs; and I'm a journeyman, and a ten times better actor
                  than you, and get none."</p>
               <p>And Tom went out again feeling perfectly aggrieved at my good-fortune. For my part
                  I heartily wished he could take my place. I felt myself to be in no pleasant
                  position. Not being among my equals in rank, I expected to be unnoticed except
                  when wanted on the stage; and not being a professional actor I should not even
                  have the privilege of sneering at the bad acting.</p>
               <p>Of course, Mr. Guttenberg was only "too happy to oblige his lordship," and thought
                  "you ought to be keenly sensible of the honor, Ambrose," though Ambrose was not.
                  But when did a true, manly and independent British tradesman not feel delighted at
                  a service demanded by a peer of the realm?</p>
               <p>That evening I saw Sharp, and mentioned to him my proposed participation in the
                  performance at the castle.</p>
               <p>"Umph!" he growled. "Don't let them look down on you then. They're no better than
                  you, blood or no blood. You owe no man anything, while they're in debt, every one
                  of them."</p>
               <p>"Not the Earl?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; he too. That Mr. Wickham owes me nearly ten thousand pounds, spent in his
                  last election. It's well secured, though—well secured, or he wouldn't have had a
                  ha'p'ny from me. If his uncle dies there's a nice windfall. Your Sir Robert

                  pretty penny. In fact, I've had dealings with every one, ladies and all, who are
                  to play with you, except the Honorable Mrs. Leigh and Captain Berkeley."</p>
               <p>"Captain Berkeley is very prudent about money-matters," I said.</p>
               <p>"No, he isn't. He's a wasteful dog—buying all sorts of nick-nacks just because the
                  expense don't go beyond his income. 'Many a mickle makes a muckle,' as the Scotch
                  say, and he'll want his money some day. But you've no furred coat—you want a
                  furred coat in order to play Frederick."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I can trim an ordinary surtout with a little plush. That will answer very
                  well."</p>
               <p>"No, it won't. Those fellows shan't sneer at you. I have a furred robe that has
                  lain in tobacco these three years It is trimmed with the finest sable—none of your
                  catskin humbugs, and belonged to a gay, young attache of the Russian embassy. Mary
                  Guttenberg can take the fur off carefully, and sew it on the edges of your
                  coat."</p>
               <p>"I'm very much obliged to you, I'm sure."</p>
               <p>"Yes; you ought to be—the fur might get injured. But I'm getting extravagant—like
                  a fool. I shouldn't wonder if I came to want yet. Today I was silly enough to
                  waste my money. Yes; there was a little brat spilt some milk from her
                  pitcher—spilt it all, in fact. She was crying. I took hold of her pitcher to look
                  at it. As there was nobody looking I slipped a sixpence in her pitcher, gave it
                  back to her, and went away. I watched her from round the corner. She found the
                  money presently, and—well it was right funny, I declare, to see her tears dry up,
                  and a grin get on her dirty face, and then see the puzzled look that followed. I
                  was a fool."</p>
               <p>"I think not. The enjoyment was certainly worth the sixpence."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but don't you see," returned Sharp, argumentatively, "she only lost a
                  pen'orth of milk. Now, if I'd put in a penny she'd have been just as delighted,
                  and I threw away five pence. Five pence at compound interest for fifty years—"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sharp," I interrupted, "you'll allow me to say that it isn't Abner Sharp whom
                  I know, that is talking now, but the Abner Sharp the public know; and I prefer my
                  own acquaintance to the public's a good deal."</p>
               <p>"You're an impudent boy," retorted Sharp. "But let me get you the coat."</p>
               <p>I pass over the details of the rehearsal. They were spiritless, of course, as all
                  such things are, whether amateur or professional. Mr. Haresfoot was nearly driven
                  frantic by people persisting in coming on at the wrong cues, and going off by the
                  wrong exits. The ladies were even more provokingly stupid than the gentlemen, and
                  every few minutes the voice of Mr. Haresfoot, saying—"That is <emph>not</emph> the
                  entrance, my dear!" interrupted the business.</p>
               <p>"Pray, Mr. Fecit," asked our Emily Worthington, "what does the man mean by
                  'dearing' me so absurdly?"</p>
               <p>I explained to her that it was a technical term applied by all stage-managers to
                  all females, old or young, during rehearsal, and that Mr. Haresfoot was merely
                  following a professional habit without reference to the different position of the
                  parties addressed. "You will observe, madam," I said, "that the more he is vexed
                  the stronger grows the emphasis on the term. If he should murmur 'my dear," very
                  tenderly, he is extremely put out; and when he brings it out with unction, 'my
                  d-e-a-r!' he is in a terrible passion."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Leigh laughed heartily. "He is a very singular person," she said. "What a
                  ridiculous habit the man has of winking both his eyes."</p>
               <p>"That, madam," I observed, is <choice>
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> language of Nod, and means—'Good characters are to be murdered
                  to-night.'"</p>
               <p>"Pray, answer for yourself, sir," she cried, gaily. "I intend to play with spirit;
                  that is, if I have a Frederick who will make love to me properly—on the stage—as
                  he is in duty bound to do."</p>
               <p>At length it was all over, and I was about to go, when a footman informed me that
                  the ladies wished to speak with me in the drawing-room. I followed him and he
                  ushered me into the presence of the Countess of Landys, Mrs. Leigh and several
                  others.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Fecit," said Mrs. Leigh, "we have arranged some tableaux, to be shown after
                  the play. We are desirous of adding another—Conrad and Medora. You have such a
                  charming piratical look about you" (here she laughed gaily and I bowed ironically)
                  "that I have ventured to request you to be my Conrad for the occasion."</p>
               <p>"With great pleasure, madam. But I am at a loss, on so short a notice, for the
                  costume."</p>
               <p>"We have discussed all that, sir,"<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6403-00000024"/> said
                  Lady Landys. "Gifford, the dowager's maid, to whom we mentioned it, tells us that
                  there are a number of dresses in the lumber-room, and among them one that will
                  answer. I have directed her to have it properly aired, and sent to the
                  dressing-room for you this evening."</p>
               <p>I thanked her ladyship and bowed myself out.</p>
               <p>At night we assembled in one of the drawing-rooms, used as a temporary green-room,
                  awaiting the call, and I slipped out for a moment to get a view of the theatre
                  that had been improvised for the occasion. The stage had been arranged at one
                  extremity of the great hall, and the part reserved for the spectators had been
                  fitted up with seats very neatly. The scenery and appointments, which had been
                  prepared under Haresfoot's supervision, were very complete. Peeping through a hole
                  in the curtain (however new it may be every theatrical curtain has a peep-hole) I
                  saw the audience gradually gather in, and presently they were all seated. On the
                  extreme right sat the dowager Countess, attended by Gifford; and in the centre
                  were the Earl and Countess of Landys, attended by their intimate friends. In the
                  background stood the servants. Mr. Osborne, whose position was intermediate
                  between servitude and equality, stood a little apart leaning against the wall. I
                  took in this survey, and then returned to the green-room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Leigh chatted with me while I was waiting for the call, and when she was not
                  on the stage herself. I readily saw through her purpose. She had noted that I felt
                  isolated, and in the kindness of her heart endeavored to set me at ease. I knew
                  that my history had been told to the guests, and that I was the subject of
                  observation and curiosity, perhaps pity—a still more galling position for me to
                  take. These reflections caused me a deal of embarrassment at first, and when I
                  made my appearance in the third act, I did little to justify the panegyric on my
                  histrionic ability which Berkeley, as I learned by Mrs. Leigh, had given to the
                  party. This did not last long. The excitement of the scene soon roused me up, and
                  I dashed out vigorously. The part itself is not much; but as Humphrey and Sir
                  Robert were but poorly represented, and as Emily supported me well, the part stood
                  out strongly in relief. The audience began to warm, Ollapod was very quaint and
                  funny, and the curtain fell on the final scene amid the applause of the noble and
                  aristocratic spectators. Everybody complimented me—even Haresfoot condescended to
                  say that it was a very clever performance (sinister eye winking) for an amateur,
                  (dexter eye snapping); and if I ever chose to go on the stage he would find a
                  vacancy in his company for me; the whole of which was emphasized by at least three
                  double winks fired off with the utmost rapidity.</p>
               <p>The stage was now cleared for the tableaux, and I went into the dressing-room to
                  prepare for my share of the closing scene. I found a bundle there with a note sent
                  by Sharp, the latter stating that having heard that I was to appear as Conrad in
                  the closing tableau, he had sent me something I might need. I examined the bundle
                  and found it to contain a Turkish yataghan and pistols and a dagger, which I
                  recognized as similar to the Malay krees found in the old house, but longer, and
                  with the guard at one side, extremely wide. The dress laid out for me was not
                  Turkish, however, nor could I tell of what nation. It consisted of a red cap,
                  shaped like a brimless hat, a long full embroidered robe, red trousers trimmed
                  like the cap, and a black, gilt-edged belt. The hat, jacket and trousers were very
                  well, but I could not arrange the robe to my satisfaction. At length I girt it
                  around me with the belt, and let it fall to my feet. When I had done so, I looked
                  into the mirror to try the effect, and started in surprise.</p>
               <p>I was made up to look exactly like the portrait of the pirate in the gallery, and
                  the resemblance was certainly striking. This was a trick of Gifford, but I had no
                  time to conjecture her object, for the call-boy run his head in the door and
                  called out: "Mr. Fecit for the last tableau!" and I ran down stairs to take my
                  place in the final scene.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Leigh looked at me and said: "That is a very becoming dress, certainly, Mr.
                  Fecit; but it doesn't belong to Conrad."</p>
               <p>I agreed with her, but what was I to do?</p>
               <p>The bell tinkled and the curtain rose. Mrs. Leigh was seated at my feet, lute in
                  hand, and my head was turned nearly full front to the audience. As the curtain
                  went up I could see the Earl rise slowly, as though in perfect amazement. The
                  elder Countess leaned forward with an expression of wonder and dismay
                  overspreading her countenance. The next moment she raised herself from her seat,
                  and with the words, shrieked rather than spoken: "He is alive! Bugunda Jawa!" fell
                  back in violent hysterics.</p>
               <p>All was confusion in an instant, the tableau became alive at once; and the guests
                  were gathered in groups, wondering at the circumstance, as they bore the dowager
                  Countess to her apartment. I knew nothing of that until afterwards, for when the
                  curtain had suddenly fallen I hastened up stairs, resumed my Frederick dress,
                  which I had worn to the castle, and taking the bundle containing the arms, came
                  down to leave. As I reached the stair-foot I met Mr. Osborne.</p>
               <p>"Youngster," said he, "what did you mean by putting on that dress? Answer me
                  that."</p>
               <p>"Mean!" I retorted, "What should I mean, Mr. Osborne? It was the dress left out
                  for me and I put it on. What do <emph>you</emph> mean, sir, by addressing me in
                  that tone?"</p>
               <p>"Where did you get it?"</p>
               <p>"Her ladyship had it sent to me; Lady Landys."</p>
               <p>"How did she know of it?"</p>
               <p>"Gifford pointed it out, I believe,"</p>
               <p>He left me suddenly, coupling Gifford's name with an expression too profane to
                  print.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>When Mr. Guttenberg learned of the occurrences at the castle he was alarmed lest
                  the Earl might be vexed, and withdraw his favors and patronage from our
                  circulating library and printing-rooms. This would have been a serious blow, for
                  although directly these were not much, yet as his lordship, by virtue of his title
                  and property set the fashion in those parts, indirectly they were a great
                  deal.</p>
               <p>"It's a very sad affair, Ambrose,"<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6403-00000025"/> said
                  he, "very stupid on your part to get yourself up in that way. I am astonished at
                  you."</p>
               <p>"But it was not my fault, sir. How could I help it? The dress was prescribed for
                  me, and I took it. It is no great matter for complaint that an old lady should
                  take a whim into her head and go off in hysterics. And it's no great matter, sir,
                  I should think, to the Earl, who must be used to her eccentricities."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is. His lordship don't like to have an occurrence which will set every
                  one to talking. And then you mustn't call her an 'old lady.' It isn't proper."</p>
               <p>"Isn't she an old lady, sir?"</p>
               <p>"An old lady! Good gracious! Why her husband was a peer of the realm!"</p>
               <p>"It was not my fault, I am sure, sir. I did not invite myself to the castle."</p>
               <p>"Now, hush! I am ashamed of you. It was an act of condescension to ask you. You
                  ought to feel it deeply, and your remark sounds like ingratitude."</p>
               <p>And very ungrateful the bookseller thought me. However all my adopted father's
                  fears were dissipated on the following day by a visit from Mr. Osborne, who came
                  to thank me for having assisted at the play, and to say that I was expected to
                  visit the library while the guests were in the house, as usual. He said the
                  dowager had recovered from the events of the night before; her momentary insane
                  fit had passed apparently away; and added that the ladies thought me a very
                  interesting young man, with manners above my station."</p>
               <p>I chafed under this. This man who talked about "my station," was only one remove
                  above a lackey, and I felt convinced that his language was his own. I preserved a
                  contemptuous silence until he had gone, and then I broke into a torrent of wrath,
                  innocent of effect, as there was no one to listen but Mr. Guttenberg, and he
                  thought me mad. It had one good effect, however, it relieved me of my suppressed
                  vexation, and next moment I smiled at the consternation of the printer and my own
                  folly.</p>
               <p>Berkeley came into the printing-room during the afternoon.</p>
               <p>"Ambrose," said he, "your'e a doosid lucky fellah! you've made a sensation. The
                  whole town is talking about you. You're the observed of all observers. The ladies
                  declare there never was such a printer since types were invented. The Honorable
                  Mrs. Leigh raves about you and declares you are a young eastern rajah in
                  disguise."</p>
               <p>"It's all very annoying," I said, picking away at the letter, for I was at work at
                  the case.</p>
               <p>Tom Brown and the two apprentices (for we had two new ones) laughed.</p>
               <p>"I'd like to have been in his place," said Tom.</p>
               <p>"Would you?"</p>
               <p>"Wouldn't I?"</p>
               <p>"Sensible fellah, Thomas, you!" answered the Captain. "Annoyed, eh! If I could
                  have made half the impression I'd have been content to have put types in that
                  what-d'ye-call-it-there for the remainder of my existence. You're famous, I tell
                  you. Your friend Sharp would do a good business to exhibit you at the Museum along
                  with the nick-nackeries. By the by, where did you get that magnificent sabre you
                  wore in the tableau?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sharp was kind enough to send the arms for me," I replied, "when he found I
                  was to stand in the tableau."</p>
               <p>Berkeley whistled.</p>
               <p>"And that magnificent fur on your surtout—was that from Sharp too?"</p>
               <p>"It was."</p>
               <p>"Worse and worse; or, rather, better and better. Stranger than the Sphynx, by
                  Jove! Old Sharp was never known to do a kind thing to any one before. I am quite
                  sure he would never have loaned that sword to me without twice its value left as
                  collateral security. Your power over him is very odd. Do you know they say when he
                  gets in company with you, he is absolutely genial! What is your secret? Are you
                  Dr. Faustus come back, and in league with the old gentleman below?"</p>
               <p>The Captain ran on for some time in that way until he remembered an engagement to
                  dine, and left with the quizzical caution not to run off with the Honorable Mrs.
                  Leigh, as he had designs matrimonially on that lady himself, and should certainly
                  kill and eat his successful rival.</p>
               <p>To satisfy Mr. Guttenberg, I resumed my visits to the library. The visitors to my
                  Lord Landys were not of studious habits, and I seldom met any of them amid the
                  books. When I did it was because they dawdled in there for a partial refuge from
                  ennui; and then in a little while dawdled out.</p>
               <p>On Monday after the performance I was at the castle. I had not been seated a
                  minute after hanging up my overcoat, before Gifford came in.</p>
               <p>"I have been watching for you," said she. "Pray come to my lady."</p>
               <p>I followed her, and she ushered me into the presence of the Countess dowager.</p>
               <p>The old lady half rose as I entered, and pointed to a chair. I seated myself.</p>
               <p>"Gifford," she said, "see that no one disturbs us."</p>
               <p>The waiting-woman retired.</p>
               <p>"Now, young gentleman," said the Countess, "I have heard something of your
                  history, but not fully. Will you do me the favor to recite it so far as you
                  can."</p>
               <p>I told her all I knew or had heard—at least the essential parts of it. She
                  listened attentively, and when I had concluded, came towards me, scanned my
                  features carefully, laid her hand on my ear, and then resumed her seat, much
                  agitated.</p>
               <p>"It is very singular," she muttered, "and it cannot be. Yet that peculiar mark.
                  Does Mr. Marston know your history?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Marston?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I see. You call him the Earl of Landys. I had forgotten. But the true earl
                  will return—yes, he will return. He is not dead or his spirit would have come to
                  tell me. But what did I ask you? I forget; for my brain wanders sadly of
                  late."</p>
               <p>"If the present Earl knew my history. He knows as much as I have told you," I
                  replied.</p>
               <p>Have a care then. He suspects you, and will do you a mischief. And beware of
                  Osborne. I may send for you again. Will you come?"</p>
               <p>"Should I receive your ladyship's message, I will strive to obey it," I answered,
                  as I bowed myself out.</p>
               <p>I returned to the library and had not been there long before the Earl<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6403-00000026"/> came in. He smiled as he returned my bow.</p>
               <p>"We had quite a scene the other night, Mr. Fecit."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
               <p>"The Dowager Countess's infirmity gives her strange fancies. Your performance of
                  Frederick was very spirited."</p>
               <p>I bowed my acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>"Be seated. Have you thought on what I suggested once concerning India?"</p>
               <p>This was the third time during the year that he had asked me a similar question,
                  and it was to be the third time I was to make him a similar answer.</p>
               <p>"I am sincerely obliged to your lordship for the kind offer, but for the present I
                  have determined to remain here, and find employment at the business which I have
                  been taught."</p>
               <p>How we sin through courtesy and the rule of the world! I was by habit and
                  principle opposed to falsehood; and yet I here caught myself lying outrageously. I
                  was not sincerely obliged to his lordship at all; on the contrary I was angry at
                  the persistent offer. Nor did I think it kind, for I believed it to be prompted by
                  some sinister motive, the nature of which I could scarcely conjecture.</p>
               <p>His lordship took snuff and laid the box on the table.</p>
               <p>"Don't let me interrupt your studies," said he, and took up a book. I resumed
                  mine, not to study but to think. On looking up a few minutes after I found the
                  Earl had gone. His gold snuff-box lay on the table. I thought it a piece of
                  forgetfulness, but went on with my reading, and just then seeing a passage which I
                  wished to note, opened a box lying near me to get a sheet of paper. The lid of the
                  box was lined with looking-glass, and it remained up and slightly back from the
                  perpendicular. While I was writing before it Mr. Osborne came in. He bade me a
                  good day, and went to the book-case, selecting and rejecting books.</p>
               <p>I read on, and on turning a page my eye rose from the top of the book, and fell on
                  the looking-glass in the lid of the paper box. It chanced to be that angle which
                  brought the right side of the room before me. My very flesh crawled. What infamous
                  work was this!</p>
               <p>I distinctly saw Mr. Osborne with the gold snuff-box in his hand, with his eye
                  fixed upon me, advance to where my great-coat hung, and, after slipping the
                  snuff-box in the breast-pocket, gather up a couple of books from the table and
                  make a noiseless departure.</p>
               <p>I arose in alarm and excitement, but my course of action was decided on at once. I
                  removed the box, and placing it on a small table in the farthest corner of the
                  room, threw a newspaper carelessly over it.</p>
               <p>I sat there for a little while, but no one came. The warning of the old Countess
                  recurred to me. What could it all mean? At length the anxiety became
                  insupportable. I rose and put on my great coat in order to go out. I trembled with
                  excitement, and was steadying myself for a moment against the chair, when the Earl
                  accompanied by Brewis, his butler, entered.</p>
               <p>"And so, Mr. Fecit," said the peer, "you won't go to India? Why, where is my
                  snuff-box? I left it on the table. Didn't you see it here, Mr. Fecit."</p>
               <p>"I did, my lord; but it has not been here since Mr. Osborne left. Perhaps he took
                  it to hand it to your lordship."</p>
               <p>I said this in order to see if his lordship were a party to the affair.</p>
               <p>"No, I met him this moment. He would have told me, you know It is very
                  singular."</p>
               <p>"Very," I said, playing with him.</p>
               <p>"I am quite sure I left it on the table. Has any one else been here?"</p>
               <p>"No one but Mr. Osborne."</p>
               <p>"It's very odd; and I don't know, but—"</p>
               <p>It's coming now, I thought.</p>
               <p>"I am quite sure you couldn't have taken it, of course, but, as a matter of form,
                  you had better allow Brewis here to examine your pockets. It will prevent false
                  reports, you know."</p>
               <p>He felt his degradation, I was sure. He looked meanly. I put my hand to my breast
                  pocket for the express purpose of leading him on as I said:</p>
               <p>"No, my lord. I allow no man, under any pretext, to thus degrade me."</p>
               <p>"Brewis, do you hear?" asked the peer. "This is extraordinary. If you know nothing
                  of the box, why do you object to being, searched? Under such circumstances I shall
                  insist on it."</p>
               <p>"Pray," said I, "did it never occur to your lordship that you might have left your
                  box elsewhere in the room?"</p>
               <p>"No! for I am positive that I left it here."</p>
               <p>"Brewis," said I to the butler, "do me the favor to lift the paper on yonder
                  table."</p>
               <p>Brewis obeyed me, and revealed the box.</p>
               <p>"Is that what you seek, my lord?"</p>
               <p>His lordship reddened, but took the box without a word.</p>
               <p>"I ask your lordship if that be the box?"</p>
               <p>The Earl muttered "Yes!"</p>
               <p>"I owe you a thousand apologies, Mr. Fecit," he said after a pause. "The mistake
                  was mine, but your manner—"</p>
               <p>I might have affected to believe him, though I knew it to be a
                     <unclear>lie</unclear>. But I was young and hot-headed, so I interrupted him at
                  once.</p>
               <p>"I would like to believe that your lordship was not engaged in a plot that would
                  disgrace the lowest minded man in the world. But you were. What your motives may
                  have been I can't tell; but you have the comforting reflection of knowing that you
                  have failed."</p>
               <p>"Do you dare to accuse me, you beggarly brat?" he demanded angrily.</p>
               <p>"Fine language for a peer," I replied. "Do you see that mirror, my lord? Seated
                  before that, I saw your tool at his dirty work, and I have baffled him. I see
                  through you and despise you."</p>
               <p>The stupid surprise on the butler's features satisfied me that he, at least, was
                  not in the conspiracy. The contents of Paul Bagby's letter came to my mind and I
                  could not refrain from a parting shot at random.</p>
               <p>"Let me tell your lordship one thing. I am more prudent than Don Jose
                  Espinel."</p>
               <p>The shot told. The Earl's features grew livid with rage and apprehension, and with
                  a laugh I turned on my heel and left him.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the Storm becomes so fierce that I Scud before it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I went home immediately from the castle, and entered the printing room in no
                  pleasant frame of mind. I felt that I had been led by my passion into a serious
                  error. The allusion to Espinel's abduction, or murder, whichever it might be, was
                  entirely wrong—not only unnecessary of itself, but a breach of confidence. The
                  Earl would know very well the source from whence I had my information, and thus I
                  had compromised myself. The attempt against myself I could trace to nothing but a
                  belief that I was acquainted with the secret of Espinel; and unfounded though that
                  belief was, the boast would confirm it. In any view of the case I had let my
                  resentment get the better of my prudence—no very wonderful position for a youth to
                  take.</p>
               <p>Tom Brown expressed surprise at my quick return and commented on my fretted
                  countenance; but I parried his thrusts and answered his questions by evasive
                  monosyllables. I took my composing stick in hand and commenced to set up one of
                  Mr. Hinck's ponderous leaders. But I was too moody and restless, and emptying my
                  half-filled stick on a galley, I left the copy on the case, threw off my apron,
                  and started for the shop. Here I found Mr. Guttenberg behind the counter serving
                  some customers with stationery.</p>
               <p>"You are soon back from the castle to-day, Ambrose."</p>
               <p>The fact that I went to the castle regularly by invitation of the Earl was a
                  matter of pride with the printer, and he was fond of alluding to it before
                  strangers.</p>
               <p>I answered him in the affirmative and passed on to the back room. As I did so I
                  heard him say, in reply to some remark made by one of the customers—</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! a great favorite with his lordship."</p>
               <p>"Why, dear me, Ambrose!" exclaimed Mrs. Guttenberg, looking up from her work as I
                  entered the apartment where she was engaged in sewing, "you look quite ill. What
                  is the matter? Are you sick?"</p>
               <p>"Heart-sick, mother," I answered; for I often called her mother, though I never
                  called her husband father; "heart sick."</p>
               <p>"What's the matter now, Brosy?" inquired Mary, "you are pale as a ghost."</p>
               <p>"Mary, I want to talk to your father and mother a while. Suppose you go into the
                  shop and ask your father to come here when he is disengaged. You can take his
                  place awhile."</p>
               <p>"What's it all about? Can't I know too?"</p>
               <p>"Do as Ambrose bids you," said her mother.</p>
               <p>Mary went out pouting, and in a few minutes Mr. Guttenberg came in I told the
                  couple all that had occurred between me and the Earl, with the exception of my own
                  parting speech.</p>
               <p>"The vile wretches!" exclaimed Mrs. Guttenberg, indignantly.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Guttenberg only looked grave.</p>
               <p>"There seems to be no doubt about Mr. Osborne," he said; "but you did wrong to
                  insult his lordship. He no doubt thought you <emph>did</emph> take the box. It was
                  natural enough under the circumstances, he not knowing you well."</p>
               <p>"Why," said I, "he was in the plot."</p>
               <p>"That can't be," was the rejoinder. "A peer of the realm! Impossible!"</p>
               <p>"A peer of the realm may be a rascal as well as a peasant of the soil."</p>
               <p>"But he could have no motive."</p>
               <p>"He has one, depend on it. I have reason to suspect it, and know why; but it is
                  quite enough, I think, to recall the warning of the old Countess."</p>
               <p>"She is half crazy—wholly so at times. You look at it wrongly."</p>
               <p>We talked the matter over without coming to any agreement. While still engaged in
                  the discussion, Mary came in to tell us that a footman was at the door with a
                  message from Lord Landys who desired to see Mr. Guttenberg immediately, and his
                  lordship's own carriage was in waiting to convey the stationer to the castle.</p>
               <p>"To see me! Bless me!" exclaimed the tradesman, in a flutter of excitement. "Get
                  me my best coat, Mrs. Guttenberg. Mary, tell the servant I'll be ready presently.
                  His lordship's own coach! What an honor! Thank you, my dear. Tidy my cravat a
                  little, Mrs. Guttenberg. It's all about you, Ambrose. I'll be conciliatory, but
                  firm."</p>
               <p>Firm! a tradesman with an earl!</p>
               <p>"There, my dear, that will do. Ambrose, take charge of the shop till I
                  return."</p>
               <p>When we left the back room we found Berkeley and the lieutenant-colonel of the
                  regiment, a gray-haired, ramrodish individual, named Carden, chatting with
                  Mary.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, gentlemen, but I have to go to the castle on a little business. His
                  lordship has sent for me, and his lordship's coach is waiting, and Ambrose and
                  Mary will attend to you"—and with this off went the delighted printer, riding
                  grandly for the first time in his life, in a coach with a coronet on the
                  panels.</p>
               <p>"He's in a doosid hurry, to be sure," said Berkeley. "Miss Guttenberg, the Colonel
                  wants that novel I had yesterday. Is there a copy in?"</p>
               <p>"Two of them, Captain. Which will you have, Colonel?"</p>
               <p>"Whichever you choose."</p>
               <p>"Take care, Colonel," laughed Berkeley. "One is dog's-eared, and the other
                  mortally wounded in the last leaf. Now, the question is, dog's-ears, or the
                  veteran."</p>
               <p>"The complete one, by all means, then."</p>
               <p>While the Colonel was examining some stationery, I took the Captain aside.</p>
               <p>"Are you engaged to-night?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"No—at least to nothing which can't be put off. Why?"</p>
               <p>"Can you spare me a couple of hours?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then meet me at the Crown and Angel at seven."</p>
               <p>"Of course, my boy, if it will oblige you. What's up?"</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you then."</p>
               <p>Out went the brace of officers. I went to the desk and wrote a note to Sharp,
                  requesting him to meet me at the Crown and Angel at seven, if he were at all
                  interested in a matter that concerned me very much. I gave this to a neighbor's
                  boy, with directions to hunt Sharp up, and get a verbal answer. In about an hour
                  the lad returned with the reply that he would attend to it.</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6403-00000028"/>
               <p>Mary was on nettles all the time to know what was going on.</p>
               <p>It was quite late in the day when Mr. Guttenberg returned in the noble man's
                  coach. He was filled with news, and called me into the back room, where Mrs.
                  Guttenberg impatiently awaited us.</p>
               <p>"I have arranged it all properly," he said. "It was all as I conjectured. His
                  lordship has been very much deceived in his steward, whom he has discharged. His
                  lordship is very much hurt at what you said to him, but sends his regret at having
                  suspected you even for a moment; though I must agree with him that, under the
                  circumstances, the suspicion was not unnatural. Of course I promised that you
                  would apologize for your very rash, and, I must say, notwithstanding the
                  provocation, very offensive words."</p>
               <p>"This I cannot do, sir. His lordship was a party to the whole affair."</p>
               <p>"How unreasonable and absurd you are, Ambrose; and after his lordship, a peer of
                  the realm, has condescended to make the first advances, too. <emph>He</emph> a
                  party! Why he is perfectly furious against Mr. Osborne!"</p>
               <p>"Is he? Will he have his steward arrested for his attempt to fasten crime on
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"He has sent him away."</p>
               <p>"He will bring him back in good time."</p>
               <p>"Now, my dear boy, you surely won't refuse, when I've made a promise. There's
                  nothing disgraceful in a frank apology for such words to a superior."</p>
               <p>"True, sir; but here the apology would involve a falsehood. I am not the least
                  sorry for my conduct, which was proper enough."</p>
               <p>"Ambrose," said Mr. Guttenberg, "I need not remind you that I have always done my
                  duty by you. I have treated you like a son. Can you refuse <emph>me</emph> a
                  favor, and not only lose me a patron, but gain me an enemy?"</p>
               <p>I was a little affected by this appeal, but none the less firm. I answered
                  promptly:</p>
               <p>"I am grateful to you—I would serve you in almost anything; but I will not
                  apologise to Lord Landys, and certainly will never hold any intercourse with him.
                  He is an unprincipled man, and my enemy."</p>
               <p>"What nonsense! He's your friend—spoke of you in the warmest manner, said you were
                  a young man of the highest promise; and even offered to have you appointed to a
                  post in India, and to advance a thousand pounds for your outfit. A thousand
                  pounds! Think of that!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, for some motives of his own he is quite anxious to exile me to India."</p>
               <p>"Motives! What could he have?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know; but I do know that he's a scoundrel."</p>
               <p>"Goodness! the boy is mad! A scoundrel! An earl! a nobleman that will be a duke
                  when his grace of Sellingbourne dies—a scoundrel! What folly! I tell you what,
                  Ambrose, you are standing in your own light. You will be of age in a few days. I
                  have the papers drawn up, all ready to sign and seal, making you a full partner,
                  not only in the printing and stationery business, but in the
                     <title>Chronicle</title>. I had always meant you should share equally with
                  Mary, as though you were my own son; and now you make me go back of my word."</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, but I can't help it."</p>
               <p>"Then there'll be no Guttenberg &amp; Fecit, I can tell you. No, sir! you'll be no
                  partner of mine—no anything here. You shall leave this house. I'll have no further
                  to do with you!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't say that, John," sobbed his wife. "Give him time. He won't be so
                  obstinate if he has time to consider."</p>
               <p>I shook my head.</p>
               <p>"I'll give him twenty-four hours, and not one moment more. Let him make up his
                  mind by this time to-morrow. If he chooses to sacrifice his home and his
                  prospects, and to repay me with ingratitude, all through his selfishness and
                  obstinacy, let him do it—that's all."</p>
               <p>Off flounced Mr. Guttenberg into the shop, really believing himself a much-injured
                  man, and I absolutely and positively heard him speak snappishly to a customer.
                  Mrs. Guttenberg cried, and pleaded with me. I answered the good old soul kindly
                  and affectionately, but I was determined, nevertheless. Mary came in and looked on
                  in double distress—a two-headed misery on her part—firstly, on account of the
                  general unhappiness, and secondly, because she couldn't tell what it was all
                  about.</p>
               <p>That night I went to the Crown and Angel, called for a private room, and directed
                  the waiter to send in those who inquired for me.</p>
               <p>Captain Berkeley came in about ten minutes before seven.</p>
               <p>"Here I am, old fellah," cried he, "in advance of time. Now, what is it?"</p>
               <p>"Wait awhile, Captain. I don't want to tell the same story twice."</p>
               <p>"A council of three, eh? Who's the third?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sharp."</p>
               <p>"Whew!" whistled Berkeley. "Old money-bags, eh? This will be a queer
                  confabulation."</p>
               <p>"You won't have to wait long, Captain, for there goes the first stroke of my
                  godfather."</p>
               <p>The last peal of the great bell of St. Stephen's was still echoing when a tap at
                  the door announced the servant who came to usher in old Sharp. The latter stared
                  in surprise at Berkeley, and then, recovering himself, said:</p>
               <p>"Well, what is it, Ambrose? Don't keep me waiting. Time is money."</p>
               <p>"I wish the bankers agreed with you, old fellah," said Berkeley, gaily.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!"</p>
               <p>I hastened to prevent a threatened explosion by telling the story of the Earl's
                  attempt, as I had told it before to the Guttenbergs. I did not give my own
                  history—it was not needed. Had I done so it might have saved me some after
                  trouble. But who knows his future?</p>
               <p>"Now," said I, when I had finished, "the question is—what shall I do?"</p>
               <p>"The Countess is mad, and the Earl is madder, and Guttenberg is maddest. Mad or no
                  mad," said Berkeley, "he wants to get you out of the road, for some reason best
                  known to himself. It is quite clear to my mind that if you don't go he'll do you a
                  mischief. My advice is, cut and run. What do you say, Mr. Sharp?"</p>
               <p>"The Captain is right, Ambrose. You must leave Puttenham for the present, and
                  quickly."</p>
               <p>"But how, and when?"</p>
               <p>"At once. Four wagons start for London at two to-morrow morning. One of these will
                  take you. The wagoner will not disoblige me; he owes<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC6403-00000029"/> me nine pound five shillings nop'nse ha'penny. You
                  can get into the wagon just out of town, and I'll instruct him what to do. Don't
                  attempt to leave the wagon for the mail, no matter how slowly you go. When you get
                  to London—but have you any friend there?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; one I can rely on, I think, Mr. Paul Bagby."</p>
               <p>"Well, go to him, and keep quiet. Have you any money?"</p>
               <p>"About five pounds; that will last me until I get employment in some
                  printing-house."</p>
               <p>"Let me give you some money, or you may get into trouble."</p>
               <p>Berkeley raised his eyebrows at such an offer from Sharp, and then a second time
                  when I declined it.</p>
               <p>"Very foolish," muttered the old man. "Better lean on a friend's staff than be
                  struck by an enemy's cudgel. However, I'll give you a sealed letter to my bankers
                  when you leave, and you must promise to avail yourself of it when you are in
                  need."</p>
               <p>I promised.</p>
               <p>"Now, go home," said Sharp, "get what you want at home; but don't encumber
                  yourself with a large bundle. Light load, more speed. Slip out unobserved, and
                  meet us at the Reindeer an hour after midnight."</p>
               <p>"But this looks like flight, and I am not sure—"</p>
               <p>"Not a word," said Berkeley. "You asked us to do your thinking, and we have done
                  it. The enemy is too strong, and you must retreat. Leave us to cover your
                  rear."</p>
               <p>I could see no help for it. It was a choice between going at once of my own
                  accord, or of being kicked out the next day by Mr. Guttenberg. So I returned home,
                  and when the family had retired, made a bundle of a spare suit and some shirts,
                  took the ring and other tokens connected with my history, rolled up Zara's
                  portrait, which I cut from its frame, and at a few minutes after one o'clock, let
                  myself quietly out into the street.</p>
               <p>I found the Reindeer. There were several large wagons in the yard. I was about to
                  go to them, when some one tapped me on the shoulder. It was Berkeley, cloaked. He
                  whispered to me:</p>
               <p>"Keep from the wagon. We have talked with the wagoner, who will take you up at a
                  distance from town. You know St. George Clyst."</p>
               <p>This was a church on the high-road, nearly five miles from town.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, walk on, and remain in the by-road there. The wagon has one grey horse in
                  the lead; the rest are bays. There are three other wagons, and yours will start
                  last. When you see it approach the mouth of the bye-road, step up to it, and say
                  to the driver, 'fine night for a race.' He'll tell you to get in. Keep close until
                  you arrive in London."</p>
               <p>Sharp, who had come forward during the utterance of these instructions, slipped
                  the promised letter into my hand. They both wished me good-speed, and I promised
                  to write to them, and give them the name I should assume, for it was not deemed
                  advisable to retain my own in London. We shook hands and parted, and I pushed on
                  to the place of rendezvous.</p>
               <p>I waited at the spot pointed out for a long while. At length I heard the jingling
                  of bells, and watched first one and then two other wagons pass as I lay in the
                  shadow of the wall. The fourth, with the light horse in the lead, came according
                  to promise in its turn. The wagoner was walking with his horses, evidently
                  expecting some one. I advanced, spoke as had been agreed on, and was helped into
                  the wagon, which only contained hay and a couple of bags of feed. The train was
                  returning empty. I buttoned my great coat closely around me, and was soon fast
                  asleep.</p>
               <p>I waked up about an hour after day-dawn. We had stopped at a road-side tavern,
                  called the Fair-Mile Inn, and here the wagoner secured me a lunch. The second
                  night I got out of the wagon before we arrived at our stopping-place, and took
                  lodgings as though I were a foot-passer. In the morning I went out before the
                  starting of the wagon, which picked me up two or three miles farther on. And this
                  was the daily manner of the journey.</p>
               <p>On the fifth day after our departure for London, when within two miles of the town
                  of Coppleton, the fore axletree broke short off in the middle, and our progress
                  was suddenly checked. After a consultation between the wagoner and myself, it was
                  agreed that I should walk to the town, and send back a wheelwright. I did so,
                  although I had some trouble to find an artizan disengaged, and more trouble to
                  induce him to go so far. As I was now within forty miles of London, I concluded to
                  remain in the town a few days to recruit myself after my five days' shaking. So I
                  took lodgings at a quiet looking inn, sent for my scanty luggage, and bestowed it
                  and myself in a snug apartment, where I passed a very pleasant night.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XI.,</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>In which I find a former acquaintance, and make new ones.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>The town of Coppleton is of modern growth, and owes its importance principally to
                  its glove manufactories, and two large establishments for the manufacture of
                  chemicals. In the morning I took a stroll through it, to see what was most worthy
                  of note. As I roamed up one street and down another, my eyes frequently rested on
                  flaming placards, announcing that the theatre would open on the following Monday,
                  with a new and efficient company; and that the performances, by command of his
                  worship the Mayor, would be "Speed the Plough," and "The Turnpike Gate." I
                  concluded that the performance would be as good, at all events, as any I had
                  hitherto seen in Puttenham, and so I said, thinking aloud:</p>
               <p>"I think, if I remain here so long, I'll go. Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Why not, indeed?" said some one at my elbow.</p>
               <p>I turned. My echo was a broad-shouldered man, rather over the middle size, with a
                  square chin, large mouth, and deeply-set eyes. He was rather shabbily dressed in
                  an old body-coat, buttoned closely up to the chin, trousers polished on the knees,
                  boots long guiltless of Day &amp; Martin's manufactured lustre, and a hat
                  garnished with brown on the edges of the crown. The presumption was that he wore a
                  shirt, that being supposed to be a necessary part of an Englishman's apparel, but
                  there was no ocular evidence of the fact. I made up my mind as to his profession,
                  from his tone of voice and manner, and rejoined:</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6403-00000030"/>
               <p>"One of the company, I presume?"</p>
               <p>"Sir, I have that honor. My name is Fuzzy—Oliver Fuzzy. You will observe my name
                  in large letters on the posters. I lead the business on this circuit—play the
                  Hamlets, Richards, and others—and occasionally demean myself by assisting in a
                  broad-sword combat between the pieces. However, that keeps my hand in for Richard
                  and Macbeth, and 'I dare do all that may become a man; who dares do more is' not
                  Oliver Fuzzy. For all of which old Hare, the Gov., allows me a miserable sal.,
                  when we are playing, and nothing and nopence a week when we are not."</p>
               <p>"You have a prominent position, Mr. Fuzzy, and it ought to be profitable."</p>
               <p>"'I do believe your grace,' it ought to be, but it isn't. We don't play here till
                  next week, and as I'm up in every thing we do for the first fortnight, I have
                  nothing to study, and so I am roaming through the town, 'a looker-on here in
                  Vienna,' cogitating on the ways and means of raising a pot of 'arf-and-'arf."</p>
               <p>Here was a character, and I resolved to study it.</p>
               <p>"Suppose you join me in a pot," I said. "I have played a little myself <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">en amateur</foreign>, and have a sympathy with the
                  profession."</p>
               <p>"Will I? 'Come on, Macduff.'"</p>
               <p>"But you'll have to point me out the proper place, for I am a stranger here."</p>
               <p>"Point! nothing easier, as long as you'll point when we get there. 'I do remember
                  me that hereabouts there lives,' not 'a starved apothecary,' but a well-fed
                  publican, who deals in most excellent potations. Shall I attend your grace?"</p>
               <p>"Lead on; I follow," I said, catching his humor.</p>
               <p>We soon found ourselves in a little, quiet ale-house, in an alley just back of a
                  plain and dingy-looking building, which my companion informed me was the theatre.
                  By the numerous portraits of leading actors on the walls, as well as from its
                  proximity to the playhouse, I inferred that the place was a resort for actors and
                  their friends. A couple of pots of half-and-half were soon foaming before us, and
                  Mr. Fuzzy, blowing off the froth, and exclaiming, "Off with his head! So much for
                  Buckingham," took a hasty draught, and replaced the half empty pot on the
                  table.</p>
               <p>"With some bread and cheese, and a pipe to follow," he said, "this were a banquet
                  for the gods."</p>
               <p>"Wouldn't a chop be better?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Chop! if there be anything for which this house is famous, outside of its malt
                  liquors, it is a chop."</p>
               <p>So I ordered the chops, and while they were preparing, I asked him concerning the
                  actors.</p>
               <p>"A very fine company, sir," said he. "It's true that our juvenile man is rather
                  shaky—the Governor goes in for that line himself, and he's past it now—fifty if
                  he's a day; but juvenility is his weakness. Then he chews his words like Charles
                  Kean—that young man'll never make an actor; I know it. I've seen him. Otherwise
                  the company is tip-top, for a poor circuit. Cripps is our low comedy man—more than
                  passable; we've a very honest fellow who makes an admirable villain lain; and then
                  there's Finch—a good old fellow is Charley Finch—he does everything well, and has
                  to do everything, second old man, heavy fathers, high-priests, eccentric comedy,
                  and so on Then there's myself—well, I don't boast; but I could have trod the
                  London boards before now. Lots of city managers have made me offers; but my
                  health, my health, you see—here's to you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"And the women?"</p>
               <p>"The ladies of the company are clever—one especially—Cecilia Finch. She's a
                  prodigy; the best little juvenile, the best daughter, and in chambermaids—well,
                  they haven't anything in London can hold a candle to her. Ah, she's a gem! and
                  everything she does is—done to a turn, I declare."</p>
               <p>The last observation had reference to the chops, which the waiter then placed upon
                  the table, and which my new friend attacked with a vehemence and vigor highly
                  complimentary to the grazier who fed the sheep, and the cook who prepared the
                  meal, not neglecting his speech in the intervals of mastication.</p>
               <p>"We have a vacancy in the company, though; we want a light comedy man. We had one
                  engaged, but a screw's loose somehow. I suppose the Governor will scare one up
                  somewhere in time. And here he comes, and Charley Finch."</p>
               <p>I looked up, and there was my old acquaintance, Haresfoot, in company with a
                  slender, pale and gentlemanly old man. Haresfoot caught my eye, and recognized me
                  at once.</p>
               <p>"Pray, my dear sir," said he, shaking me by the hand, "what lucky wind has blown
                  you to our coast?"</p>
               <p>"An accident," I replied; "but I am right glad to see you. You're the manager, I
                  see."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and a very troubled one just now. The most unfortunate thing in the world.
                  I've announced 'Speed the Plough,' and here my light comedian sends me word three
                  days before we open, that he is laid up with a rheumatism which will prevent his
                  playing for two months."</p>
               <p>"Very unfortunate."</p>
               <p>"Unfortunate! ruinous!"</p>
               <p>And here the manager fired off his peculiar winks, right and left, with startling
                  rapidity.</p>
               <p>"By-the-bye, are you up in Bob Handy?"</p>
               <p>"I've done it a good while since."</p>
               <p>"Do it again. I'll announce you as a distinguished amateur; give you every chance.
                  They're a most discriminating and fashionable audience, the wealthiest glovers in
                  all England; fine women too; set 'em all crazy. It's a chance that only occurs
                  once in a life-time."</p>
               <p>I thought over the matter a little while. There was a love of the stage in me. I
                  liked the experiment of the thing, and had never any of its rough experiences, and
                  I consented.</p>
               <p>Mr. Haresfoot was in a state of delight at once, and fired off his double winks
                  more rapidly than ever. It was arranged that I should appear on the Monday
                  following, and if I made a hit a permanent engagement was to follow, at a salary
                  about equal to what I could earn as a journeyman printer, with two one-third
                  benefits during the year. It was also arranged that my stage name should be
                  Neville, that of Fecit not being considered eligible; and as Mr. Neville I was
                  formally introduced to Mr. Finch and Mr Fuzzy,<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6403-00000031"/> over a pot of porter a-piece, which Mr. Haresfoot
                  insisted on providing in honor of the occasion</p>
               <p>General conversation ensued, in which old Finch bore his part, and I was struck
                  with the manner and spirit of the old man's remarks. He was evidently a man of
                  education, and the style of his conversation and movements betokened the
                  gentleman. How such a man could ever have become a strolling actor was a mystery,
                  and I determined to fathom it if possible. Finch was a stage name; what his real
                  name was I felt certain I would yet know. I was not of a curious nature, in
                  general, but here there was something that provoked prying.</p>
               <p>I pass over our conversation. As soon as it closed I accompanied the party to the
                  theatre, where rehearsal was about to begin, and was there introduced to Billy
                  Nuts, who combined in his person the offices of prompter, property-man, and
                  wardrobe-keeper to the rest of the company, male and female.</p>
               <p>The rehearsal commenced. As it was manifestly to the interest of every member of
                  the company that I should succeed, one would have naturally supposed that I should
                  have received every assistance and encouragement. But actors have a contempt,
                  generally well founded, for amateurs; and do not believe that any one can ever
                  leap to a position in their profession. They think that the only way to attain
                  eminence is to climb the ladder, round by round; a belief in the main correct
                  enough, although, those who have self-possession, occasionally form exceptions to
                  the general conclusion. I knew of this feeling, and was therefore careful to make
                  no attempt at acting during rehearsal, but walked through my part in the most
                  hurried and business-like manner. Modest as was my demeanor, it did not save me
                  from sneers and contemptuous looks from every one on the stage except from Finch
                  and his daughter. Instead of daunting me, this put me on my mettle, and I took no
                  apparent notice of it, much as I chafed under the malicious looks and words of my
                  colleagues.</p>
               <p>The announcement of "a distinguished amateur, his first appearance on the regular
                  stage," set the good people of Coppleton in a fever of excitement, and to the
                  great delight of the manager, every seat in the lower tier of boxes was taken in
                  advance. The treasurer informed me as I entered the theatre on Monday morning for
                  the last rehearsal, that the box-sheet presented "a be-yu-tiful appearance," and
                  Billy Nuts said to me, as I came on the stage:</p>
               <p>"'Ere's a go! Coppleton's waked up! There'll be a crushin' 'ouse, and if you fail
                  after hall this blowin', my heyes! won't there be a jolly row!"</p>
               <p>When the night came, the little house was jammed long before the certain rose, and
                  on my appearance I was warmly received, my stage-presence being rather striking,
                  and my features prepossessing. But, to my utter dismay, a powerful stage-fright
                  took possession of me; the audience seemed to be sitting in a mist, my tongue
                  refused to move, and my knees trembled so much that I was scarcely able to stand.
                  A dead and painful silence fell over the house like a pall, interrupted by a
                  titter from one of the side-boxes. I was about to turn and flee from the stage,
                  when I caught a glimpse of the face of Fuzzy, maliciously triumphant, at the
                  wing.</p>
               <p>It recalled my powers instantly. The stage-fright left me as suddenly as it had
                  come. Through the part I rattled vivaciously, my spirits rose with every scene,
                  never was I more mercurial; and every fresh round of applause gave me new spirit.
                  The curtain dropped on the epilogue amid a deafening shout of the audience, and I
                  was called before the curtain (a rare compliment in the town) with the utmost
                  enthusiasm. I was announced to re-appear in the same character on the Wednesday
                  following, to the apparent delight of the house; and the performers crowded around
                  me on the stage to offer their congratulations on my success.</p>
               <p>"Hit's the greatest 'it, sir," said Billy Nuts, "has 'as been made 'ere, by hall
                  hodds. You're no hamachure; you're a hactor."</p>
               <p>And Billy, in the exuberance of his delight, qualified his assertion by an
                  expletive more earnest than pious, and quite unnecessary to repeat.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein Selgrove quite undoes the work of Coppleton, until we set two Richards
                     in the field.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Our season at Coppleton was a great success. I became the fashion, and it was
                  considered high <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ton</foreign> among the glove-makers to
                  witness the performance of Mr. Neville, "an artist," as the Coppleton
                     <title>Journal</title> observed, "without a peer in his line of business." This
                  should have been true, as Haresfoot was an undoubted judge of acting, and as he
                  wrote the puff and paid for its insertion, it was naturally to be presumed that
                  such was his unbiased opinion. But the plain truth was merely that I was no actor
                  at all, and owed my success to a fine figure, a rather handsome face, a strong
                  verbal memory, and a full flow of animal spirits. So long as I pleased the public,
                  the manager did not care to enlighten me as to my deficiencies; and because I
                  pleased the public, my fellow-actors did not dare to; and so I believed myself to
                  be a capital performer. I know better now; but fortunately I did not know then;
                  and the occasional sharp criticism of the judicious few fell from my self-love as
                  harmlessly as the rain-drops from the back of a water-bird. I did not forgive
                  these candid critics, nevertheless, for I believed, as a matter of course, that
                  each had an especial spite at me, and looked at my performance with the eyes of
                  envy and hatred.</p>
               <p>I became intimate with none of the company except Finch and his daughter, both of
                  whom interested me very much—wonder mingling with the interest in his case, and
                  delight mingling with the interest in hers. Cecilia Finch was at that time about
                  the age of seventeen, and though her features were neither classical in their
                  outline, nor striking in their general effect, they were nevertheless beautiful
                  from their sweetness when in repose, and their archness of expression when lit up
                  by conversation. I have said that her features were not regular, her nose being
                  too small and her forehead too high; but she had clear, hazel-grey eyes, large and
                  lustrous, and a pair of lips that were delightful to look at in repose, and were
                  highly mobile under emotion. In general her manner was extremely quiet; but on the
                  stage she was dashing, without being bold, and<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC6403-00000032"/> piquant without being pert. She was a deserved
                  favorite with the public, for she had a deal of talent, capable of still further
                  development, while she was respected by the actors in the company, and petted by
                  the actresses. This popularity was not courted. She kept herself apart from the
                  rest, and devoted herself to her father, to whom she was a shadow—seeming never
                  more cheerful than when with him.</p>
               <p>That Finch had been born, or at least bred a gentleman, I had no manner of doubt.
                  His manner, language, and evidently liberal education, betrayed the fact. It was
                  not very long before I became sufficiently intimate with him and his daughter to
                  gain his confidence, and, little by little, I obtained the leading points of his
                  history. He had been the son of a man of wealth and family, and at the age of
                  twenty had gone off to join a company of strolling players. His father, after
                  endeavoring to reclaim him in vain, had left his whole estate, which was not
                  entailed, to the younger brother, and shortly after died. Finch married a member
                  of the company to which he was attached. This completely severed him from his
                  family connections, and his lot in life was fixed.</p>
               <p>I should have said, however, that my intimacy in the company extended to one more.
                  I became well acquainted with Billy Nuts, necessarily; for Billy was the
                  ubiquitous and energetic factotum of the company, and whether he prompted the
                  performers, painted scenery, made properties, picked out dresses, or murdered the
                  King's English, he did it with a thoroughness quite his own. I soon grew to be a
                  great favorite with Billy, principally, I believe, because I admired hugely a new
                  scene—an interior—which he painted for us at Coppleton, and which, especially when
                  we consider the scanty materials at his command, was a really clever bit of art.
                  Billy was full of stories, too. He had been nearly everywhere, had tried almost
                  every line of life, and had a yarn apropos to every occasion. I used to spend a
                  deal of time, after rehearsal, in the paint-loft, where Billy, when he had nothing
                  else to do, would patch and re-vamp the old scenery, changing a worn-out English
                  landscape, by the introduction of a palm-tree here and a pyramid there, with
                  divers daubs of ochre and amber, into a passable oriental view; and by a few
                  upright strokes, surrounded by zig-zag lines, and some harlequin patches of color,
                  converting a plain English interior into a Moorish palace. In all this my former
                  intercourse with Paul Bagby enabled me to give Billy a hint or two at times, which
                  seemed to increase his respect for me amazingly.</p>
               <p>Finch, who had a taste for the fine arts, used to climb to the paint-room
                  occasionally, and there we three held confabulation on various matters to our
                  hearts' content.</p>
               <p>I had been about two months in the company, and our season at Coppleton was about
                  to close, when I learned the cause of Finch's continued melancholy. The poor man
                  had been doomed to death by his doctor, who informed him that he labored under a
                  disease of the heart which might take him away at any moment. This was the spectre
                  that haunted him night and day; that clouded his life with a darkness the most
                  terrible, and which neither the regard of those around him, nor the affectionate
                  ministrations of his daughter could for a moment disperse. If it fostered
                  melancholy, however, it begat gentleness; and Charles Finch had never had a harsh
                  or unkind word for any one, and never appeared, under any circumstances, to lose
                  either patience or temper.</p>
               <p>The very day after I had obtained these facts from Finch, we were in the
                  paint-room, as usual, and I was sketching out a scene in charcoal on a flat, for
                  the use of Billy, when the latter said:</p>
               <p>"That's a worry good idear, Mr. Neville; Spanish, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"No, Billy; it is a sketch of a spot where I was bred."</p>
               <p>"It looks Spanish. Lord bless you, we haint no scenery here can hold a candle to
                  some in Spain. That flat the Governor's so fly on, I painted from memory, but it
                  don't come up to the real thing. If I could draw like you now, I'd show 'em some
                  paintin'."</p>
               <p>"So you've been in Spain, too?"</p>
               <p>"I was a walley, sir, to a gent as traveled in the Peninzelay—an' that minds me of
                  an event. I've been puzzlin' my 'ead hever since you've been with us, about your
                  face, which I know'd I'd seen afore—and now I know why. I seed a young 'oman as
                  looked as like you as two peas—let me see—the matter of twenty odd year ago. My
                  master, Mr. Teignham an' I was in Cadiz."</p>
               <p>Finch started, and colored, for some unexplained reason, but resumed his
                  self-possession in an instant. Nuts went on with his story.</p>
               <p>"One night, he sez to me, sez he, 'Villiam, we're goin' to the Consulate.' 'Wery
                  vell, sir,' sez I. Ven ve got there I found he vos to be a vitness to a veddin'. I
                  seed the marriage myself. I didn't know their names; but the young 'oman vos the
                  von as resembled you. There; that kind o' startled look you put on brings her face
                  back to me right away."</p>
               <p>"What kind of looking man was the bridegroom?"</p>
               <p>"Vell, a tall, dark-complected man; a leetle stiff, but a nob, every hinch of 'im,
                  or I'm no judge."</p>
               <p>"Were they Spaniard's?"</p>
               <p>"I think not. They vouldn't 'a been married at the Consulate hunless they vos
                  Henglish."</p>
               <p>The conversation soon changed, but I thought over it for some time. Was I always
                  to be reminding every one of some one else, and never to know even the names of
                  the party to whom I bore so strange a resemblance?</p>
               <p>Other matters drove the conversation away from my mind. Our season at Coppleton
                  closed, and we next went to Selgrove. We had no regular theatre there, merely a
                  temporarily-fitted room, used at other times for concerts and assemblies, spacious
                  enough, however, and likely to afford ample room for our audience. For although
                  Selgrove was a theatrical town, the residence of a population fond of amusements,
                  circumstances robbed us of our power to attract. A religious revival had taken
                  place just before our advent, and the clergymen of the place preached furiously
                  against the drama. In spite of the reputation I bore from Coppleton, in spite of
                  the most flaming placards, and the most labored advertisements, our houses were
                  meagre at the commencement, and fell off visibly every night, until an audience of
                  six, all told, caused the utmost consternation to both manager and actors.</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6403-00000033"/>
               <p>Well might we be alarmed. The time for opening at Potterburn, our next town, was
                  not for three months, and as all of us, except Finch, were rather improvident,
                  there was but a gloomy prospect. Haresfoot managed adroitly enough, changing the
                  pieces every night, and trying every expedient his wits could invent; but all was
                  in vain. The theatre had been tabooed, and the people would not come. The treasury
                  was soon emptied of the surplus gained at Coppleton, and though half salaries were
                  submitted to, the houses did not afford even these. At length a council was held
                  to determine some plan by which we might retrieve our losses, or fight our way
                  until the time announced for opening at Potterburn.</p>
               <p>A most forlorn and distressed set of comedians, to be sure, gathered in council
                  upon the stage one Saturday morning. Some had been confined for a week to a single
                  meal a day, others were in debt for their lodgings, and none knew what to
                  attempt.</p>
               <p>"Now, gentlemen," said Haresfoot, when we had all assembled, "the treasury is
                  barren. Unless some one can suggest a movement likely to be profitable, we shall
                  have to suspend our performances until the season at Potterburn opens."</p>
               <p>"I can think of nothing but an empty belly," growled Fuzzy. "I've been living for
                  the last week off a pair of boots, and I can get through next week on a coat; but
                  I can't eat everything I have on my back, you know."</p>
               <p>I was aghast at this for a moment. I had read of people who had eaten leather and
                  cloth in shipwrecks, but such a thing was strange in civilized England in the
                  nineteenth century. The explanation soon flashed over my mind that the articles
                  had been sold and the money devoted to the purchase of food, and I grew easier.
                  Then, as no one had any plan to propose, I spoke up myself and said:</p>
               <p>"Have you ever given an entirely new local piece on the circuit, Mr.
                  Haresfoot?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, never. In the first place there is never any occurrence here to
                  dramatise, and in the second place the London play-wrights ask too high for their
                  pieces."</p>
               <p>"Why," I said, "the occurrences may be invented, and as for the piece, fudge
                  something out of six or seven forgotten plays, give the thing a local name, paint
                  new scenery, with views of all the principal places in town, announce it with a
                  flourish of trumpets, and the thing is done."</p>
               <p>The suggestion was hailed rapturously by all save Billy Nuts.</p>
               <p>"Hit's all wery fine," said that worthy, "hit's a hidea; lots o' tin in it, I
                  dessay; but where's the money to come from to paint the scenery? I can't daub up
                  with nothin'. Prooshin blue and chrome yaller, an' rose pink, costs money. There's
                  ten pound o' whitin', an' a paper o' lampblack, an' a pound o' glue in the
                  paint-loft; an' them won't do. Mebbe Mr. Neville 'll show us how to make paint, as
                  he's so clever."</p>
               <p>"There's a chance to get money to mount a piece," said Haresfoot, "tho' I don't
                  like the way. You know young Phipps, the butcher, That young man is bent on making
                  an Edmund Kean or a Judy of himself, and he offers twenty pounds to let him play
                  Richard for one night. It will be a sorry exhibition; but the money is tempting.
                  Still, Richard by Phipps—ugh!"</p>
               <p>We all laughed but Fuzzy; he was indignant.</p>
               <p>"Richard!" exclaimed the tragedian. "Why, who's to play Richmond?"</p>
               <p>"We expect you to do that," answered the manager.</p>
               <p>"Me! I'm only to play second to a London star, you know."</p>
               <p>"True, Mr. Fuzzy, but under such circumstances, and on an occasion—"</p>
               <p>"Occasion me no occasions, Mr. Haresfoot. Second to a butcher! Never! It's a
                  desecration of the dramatic temple—an insult to the memory of Bill Shakspeare. My
                  love for the glorious art will not stand it. Besides, Richard falls to me as the
                  leading man."</p>
               <p>"We can arrange all that," replied Haresfoot. "You two can play scene for scene
                  alternately; and then all you have to do is to play him down."</p>
               <p>"Yes, play him down," we all chorused.</p>
               <p>"Well, I rather like that. I'll do it," shouted Fuzzy; "but I must have the combat
                  scene."</p>
               <p>"Unfortunately, Phipps, to whom I have already suggested the doubling, insists on
                  being killed by Richmond. Mr. Neville is to revenge the murder of the tyrant,
                  Gloster, on his representative, and butcher the butcher."</p>
               <p>"That can all be arranged," I interposed, for a mischievous idea entered my head.
                  "I'll undertake to bring Mr. Phipps to reason. Let us consider that as all
                  settled, and now we'll sketch the plot and incident of the piece. The first point
                  is the title."</p>
               <p>"It'll have to be a taking one." growled Fuzzy, "or the jailor of Selgreve will
                  take us."</p>
               <p>"The very thing!" exclaimed Finch. "The Jailor of Selgrove—a superb title."</p>
               <p>"Who is to be a miser and a ruffian?" I said, "and yet neither one nor the other.
                  Supposed to be cruel to his prisoners, he is really studious of their comforts;
                  and supposed to be a sordid miser, he spends the money he amasses by economy in
                  secret charities to the deserving."</p>
               <p>Haresfoot laughed, for he recognized the prototype of my character.</p>
               <p>"And aids a young man," said he, "who is poor and deserving, and in love with a
                  duke's daughter, who looks down on him."</p>
               <p>"The young man turns out to be his nevvy, to whom he leaves lots o' tin,"
                  suggested Billy Nuts.</p>
               <p>"And the jailor an eccentric nobleman, who takes the position in order to effect
                  good," chimed in Finch.</p>
               <p>"And the young man is charged with murder, with the evidence strong against him;
                  but it is all cleared up in the last scene," put in one of the company.</p>
               <p>"The murder being really committed by his rival, a gloomy baronet, who commits
                  suicide in the last scene but one, and, by way of atonement, leaves half his
                  fortune to the young man aforesaid, and the other half to found a lunatic asylum,"
                  added another.</p>
               <p>"With a screaming funny man," said our low comedian, "the miser's half-starved
                  servant, who has two comic songs, and a hornpipe in fetters."</p>
               <p>"And a duett with the lively maid of the duke's daughter," I said.</p>
               <p>Thus suggestions were thrown in and noted down; incidents were stolen from other
                  plays, and held ready<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6403-00000034"/> to be dovetailed
                  in. Haresfoot and Finch agreed to put the thing into proper shape; I was to make
                  sketches of the interior of the county jail, the market place, the main street,
                  and other spots of interest, and Billy was to paint the new scenery.</p>
               <p>The next morning "the first appearance of a young gentleman on any stage, in the
                  character of the Duke of Gloster," was duly announced, and the bills were all
                  underlined with the announcement of the new piece, "a startling local drama, to be
                  produced with entirely new scenery, costumes, properties and effects."</p>
               <p>The bait took. Selgrove woke up. The old taste for theatricals revived. There was
                  every prospect that in addition to a crowded house to witness the debut of Phipps
                  we would have a perfect jam on the first night of the new piece.</p>
               <p>As to Phipps's night, it was soon placed beyond doubt, for every available place
                  was bespoken long before, and when the doors were open, the check-taker was kept
                  busy for over an hour without intermission, and long before the rising of the
                  curtain a large board, with the words chalked upon it, "No MORE STANDING-ROOM,"
                  had to he placed at the door.</p>
               <p>Matters did not go so smoothly on the stage. Phipps had expected to be furnished
                  with the proper costume, and was quite astounded, when he waited at the wardrobe,
                  to be shown a red regimental coat and buff breeches, as the dress assigned.</p>
               <p>"Oh, come!" said he, "that won't do, you know, I want my ten pounds' worth."</p>
               <p>"Ain't you goin' to git it?" inquired Billy. "What have you, or any man, got again
                  that dress, I'd like to know?"</p>
               <p>"Why, that's a soldier's coat."</p>
               <p>"Vell, vosn't King Richard a soldier? That's the hidentical coat that Garrick
                  vore. I 'ope you don't think you're a better hactor than Garrick, Mr. Phipps."</p>
               <p>"Yes—that's all well enough; but Richard was king."</p>
               <p>"So he vos; in course he vos. And didn't his late majesty vear a red coat an'
                  bluff breeches? An' vosn't he a king? In course he vos."</p>
               <p>"But look at the dress you've given Mr. Fuzzy."</p>
               <p>"Fuzzy perwides that hisself; and if he's goin' to make a fool of hisself, by
                  puttin' on such crinkums, that's <emph>his</emph> business."</p>
               <p>There was no help for it; Mr. Phipps was obliged to don the regimentals, or go on
                  in street costume. Of two evils, he wisely chose the least. He came to me with his
                  troubles, and I comforted him by asserting that the costume was a minor matter,
                  and that spirited acting would replace any deficiency in that line, especially <choice>
                     <sic>among among</sic>
                     <corr>among</corr>
                  </choice> an audience made up largely of his personal friends. The summons of the
                  call boy cut short our discussion, and at it we went.</p>
               <p>I had seen a few performances before, and a great many since; but I never beheld
                  any so peculiar as that I witnessed on that evening. Phipps was not only an
                  untaught amateur, but he had not a particle of natural genius, and bellowed,
                  stamped and roared after a fashion which beggared description. The alternation of
                  scenes made it-worse, by contrast; for Fuzzy was an actor, though a poor one, and
                  did not outrage all the proprieties by his performance. As a large number of
                  Phipps's friends were in the house, the hisses were always drowned by a storm of
                  applause; but the whole scene was the most laughable ever witnessed there; a
                  hilarious tragedy. The final scene was too much, however, for the most staunch
                  friend of the debutant.</p>
               <p>Both performers expected to have a monopoly of the last scene, and simultaneously
                  made their entrances. The audience stared, and when the two frantic Richards
                  demanded each a horse, some mad-cap in the audience shouted out:</p>
               <p>"Better take a coach and pair!"</p>
               <p>At this the house burst into a loud guffaw; but the Richards were too bent on
                  their business to notice it. Besides, the blood of each was up, and they were
                  determined to play each other down. When they simultaneously told me that they
                  hated me for my blood of Lancaster, I was well satisfied that they hated me for
                  something else, and so vigorously did they assail me, that I had some difficulty
                  in preserving my head from being cut open by the foil of one or the other.
                  However, I fought vigorously, the audience cheering at the unusually prolonged
                  combat, until my arm grew tired, and I was forced to run for it. This they, did
                  not mean to let me do; both had their blood up at the trick I had played them, and
                  assailing me from separate sides, cut off my retreat. Finding my strength failing,
                  I dodged between the two, and overleaping the narrow orchestra, sheltered myself
                  amid the audience in the pit. The two Richards would have followed me to wreak
                  their revenge, but the fiddlers drove them back, and they attacked each other. How
                  long they would have continued amid the cheering of the audience, it is impossible
                  to say, but an accident changed the character of the combat. Fuzzy's foot tripped
                  on the edge of a trap-door which had not been entirely closed, and falling
                  forward, his head struck Phipps full in the stomach. Both fell, and their swords
                  flying out of their hands, the curtain fell on the rival crookbacks engaged in a
                  supine position, in a game of fisticuffs.</p>
               <p>To prevent the house from being torn down by the excited audience, the rival
                  Richards were forced to appear before the curtain; Richard No. 1 with his left eye
                  in mourning, and Richard No. 2 with the blood streaming from his royal nostrils,
                  while the Earl of Richmond looked upon his late antagonists from his sure refuge
                  in the centre of the pit.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIII.,</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Which, after a brilliant success, brings about a catastrophe and a warning.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>The performance of Richard, which I have described in the last chapter, was not
                  only unique in itself, but serviceable to the company, since it drew attention to
                  the theatre, and set the good people of Selgrove a-gog in regard to the new piece.
                  I received no gratitude, however, but a deal of ill-will, in return for my share
                  in this desirable result. The manager declared my conduct to be highly
                  unprofessional, as no doubt it was, and took me roundly to task for having
                  compromised the dignity of the stage, and the reputation of the theatre. Fuzzy was
                  sulky and morose, and laid his bruised nose at my door. The offended amateur,
                  whose friends informed him that he had been made a butt of, threatened<pb
                     n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6403-00000035"/> ened vengeance, and endeavored to
                  organize a cabal for the avowed purpose of hissing me from the stage. A nice piece
                  of hot water I had dipped in, to be sure; and though I was under no alarm as to
                  consequences, I mentally resolved to allow my love of mischief less rein in the
                  future. Finch spoke to me very sensibly on the subject, and pointed me out that
                  the consequences of such freaks was to raise me up enemies who might at some
                  inopportune moment do me an evil turn. At the same time he admitted the temptation
                  to have been great for a lover of the ludicrous.</p>
               <p>Partly to avoid expense, and partly to impress the public with the extent of our
                  preparations, the theatre was closed for a week previous to the production of our
                  new play—the actors, when rehearsal was over each day, lounging in knots on the
                  steps, or betaking themselves to such porterhouses in the neighborhood as were
                  liberal of their credit. As for me, I divided my hours between the pursuit of my
                  favorite study of languages at home, the yarns of Billy Nuts in the paint-loft,
                  and the conversation of Finch and his daughter at their lodgings, which I
                  frequently visited. In the last case Finch was the main attraction, for though I
                  was young, and Cecilia agreeable, I was not in the least in love with the young
                  lady, nor had I the most remote reason to suspect that she regarded me in any
                  other light than that of a pleasant acquaintance.</p>
               <p>The new piece was announced for Monday night. The Saturday night previous I
                  climbed to the paint-loft to watch Nuts give the finishing touch to the great
                  scene of the Market-place of Selgrove. Billy was as loquacious as usual, and
                  Finch, who was there, more melancholy than ever. After Billy had got off one of
                  his most marvellous yarns, he turned to me and said:</p>
               <p>"An' that minds me, Mr. Neville, that there vos a gent as inkvired wery pertickler
                  arter you yisterday."</p>
               <p>"Ah! who was he?"</p>
               <p>"That's vot I don't know. He's a gent as seed me lookin' unkimmon dry, an axed me
                  to vet my vissle. I know'd he vos a gent by his behavior as sich."</p>
               <p>"What did he ask?"</p>
               <p>"Vy, he said you vos a clever young hactor, an' ax'd if you 'adn't some other name
                  besides Neville, an' vere you come from, an' vere you lodged, an' if you were
                  steady or fond of a drop. 'Vell,' sez I, 'most young hactors takes fancy names;
                  but vere Mr. Neville comes from I never ax'd, an' vere he lodges you'll git from
                  the box-hoffis', sez I, 'an' has for his steadiness, there haint a steadier or a
                  properer-behaved young man in the perfession', sez I, 'though Mr. Fuzzy does think
                  he's a leetle too fond of a lark.'"</p>
               <p>"What kind of a looking man was the questioner, Billy?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"A short, stout gent; kvite the gent in his dress an' manner he vos too; kvite
                  nobby."</p>
               <p>Finch said to me:</p>
               <p>"When you have been in the profession as long as I, you won't mind these sort of
                  inquiries. Some people take an absurd interest in the history of actors, and their
                  sayings and doings off the stage, especially if they be popular favorites. It's
                  only a troublesome way of showing their regard."</p>
               <p>"A very impertinent way."</p>
               <p>"The penalty of popularity; nothing more."</p>
               <p>I thought that probably the conjecture of Finch was correct; but the circumstance
                  gave me some uneasiness, nevertheless. This was momentary. Finch left the
                  paint-loft, and I followed and joined him on his way home, as I had promised to
                  take tea with him at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>On our way Finch said:</p>
               <p>"I have a trust for you, if you will execute it."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; if I can."</p>
               <p>"I have been troubled with a difficulty of breathing for several days past, and so
                  I consulted a doctor about it."</p>
               <p>"And he told you that you had the phthisic, I suppose," I rejoined.</p>
               <p>"Nothing of the sort, I am sorry to say. He sings the same tune with the rest. He
                  says that—well, I can't remember medical jargon, but it is something about valves
                  and auricles—and the long and short of it is that I shall not last long."</p>
               <p>"That has been the doctors' prophecy for a long while, hasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and a true one it will prove. I am prepared for the worst. I have endeavored
                  to do my duty, and the old stroller is ready to have his bones laid in earth
                  whenever it pleases Providence to so order it. I have looked death so long in the
                  face that he has no terrors for me. But Cecilia—"</p>
               <p>"Have no fears for her, my friend. She has talent, determination, and good sense,
                  and there is no one in the company who would not guard her from harm."</p>
               <p>"True; but she is young, and I have the fears of a father. I do not wish her to
                  remain on the stage. If anything should happen to me, there is a slight favor that
                  you can do me."</p>
               <p>"Name it."</p>
               <p>"Here is a letter which I have prepared. It is addressed to Adolphus Teignham,
                  Esquire. Here is his proper address on this card. If I should be carried off
                  suddenly, enclose it in one announcing my death, and post it as soon as possible.
                  It is addressed to my younger brother. He is a widower, but has no children; and I
                  think he will take charge of Cecilia, from pride of blood, if not from
                  affection."</p>
               <p>I took the letter and gave the promise required, though at the same time I tried
                  to disperse the cloud of fears which hung so heavily on the old man. It was a vain
                  attempt.</p>
               <p>The night for the new play came, and the theatre was crowded. As a drama the piece
                  was good for nothing, having neither unity of plot, coherence of incident, nor
                  novelty of character; but the local scenery which illustrated it, and the telling
                  hits which had been ruthlessly plundered from all authors, tickled the public
                  fancy, and won a complete success. For weeks and weeks it filled the house
                  nightly, until the close of the season, when the final performances was marked by
                  a tragic incident.</p>
               <p>The drama closed with the discovery of the jailer's true character, the
                  frustration of the villain, and with all those who were good being made happy, and
                  all those who were bad being made miserable—a most conventional ending.</p>
               <p>Finch played the old miser, while Cecilia and myself were the lovers of the
                  piece.</p>
               <p>The last words of Finch, which<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6403-00000036"/> brought
                  down the curtain, were:</p>
               <p>"I owed my self-mortification to the past. I have endeavored to atone for my
                  former follies, by a course of good to others. How I have succeeded is for the
                  future to determine; but for to-night it is enough if our kind friends are pleased
                  with the Jailer of Selgrove."</p>
               <p>During the entire performance Finch had hesitated several times, and seemed to
                  find difficulty in utterance. In the last scene he had got so far as the words
                  "for the future," when he stopped, burst into tears, and staggered. I caught him
                  on the instant. His features were convulsed—he repeated the words "the future,"
                  and then uttering with great difficulty, "the letter," fell back. Cecilia sprang
                  forward shrieking, and clasped his hand. He smiled on her, and the next moment was
                  dead.</p>
               <p>The stage was in confusion in an instant, and the house, which divined the event,
                  was hushed to stillness, as the curtain fell. Haresfoot went in front and
                  announced the unexpected tragedy, when the audience quietly dispersed.</p>
               <p>That night I posted the letter to Mr. Teignham, and in forty-eight hours Cecilia's
                  uncle arrived. He took charge of Finch's, or rather Frederic Teignham's body,
                  which was to be interred in the family vault at Staffordshire; at once
                  acknowledged his niece, thanked me for my attention in a polite but cold way, and
                  left on the following day.</p>
               <p>The morning of Mr. Teignham's arrival, I received by mail, bearing the Puttenham
                  post-mark, the following letter:</p>
               <p>"Honored sir—I have learned from a conversation which I have overheard, the place
                  you are at, and the name you bear, and that some harm is meant you. My lady, to
                  whom I told it, has ordered me to write and let you know. So no more at present
                  from yours to command."</p>
               <p>The epistle had neither date nor signature, but I felt well assured that it came
                  from Gifford. The inquiries, then, had been made with an object, and probably by
                  an agent of the earl, or Osborne. After reflection, I concluded the best thing for
                  me to do was to seek my original destination. I sought Haresfoot in order to tell
                  him my determination, and found him not in the best of humors.</p>
               <p>"Here is a nice piece of business, to be sure," said the manager. "They have made
                  Miss Finch break her engagement, and here I shall have to open at Pottenbury with
                  no chambermaid nor juvenile lady. Who's to fill her place, I wonder? There's
                  Parker, whose place you took, wants an engagement; but he's no lady."</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to hear you can get him," I answered, "as I will have to leave."</p>
               <p>"What! what!" exclaimed Haresfoot, firing off a dozen winks in his dismay. "You
                  going too!"</p>
               <p>"I shall be obliged to. I am glad that my going won't inconvenience you."</p>
               <p>"But I don't choose to have you leave in that way. If I suffer every one to
                  violate engagements in that kind of way, I shall be at the mercy of the
                  company."</p>
               <p>I explained my reasons as well as I could without letting him know too much of my
                  history; and as Mr. Parker was really the better actor of the two, left him
                  mollified. My affairs were soon arranged, and in a few hours I was in the city of
                  London.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Which brings back little Zara, and introduces a real Duke.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>The sensations of a provincial on his first entry into the metropolis, soon
                  change. At the beginning there is an impression of vastness, of hurry, of
                  bewilderment, and the apprehension that his dress, person and manner, are the
                  subject of the crowd's contemptuous observation; but this is soon followed by a
                  sense of dullness, the novelty wears off, indifference follows, and the
                  self-assurance that the glances around have no meaning, and that he is in some
                  measure invisible to those who have no time to spare from their own affairs by
                  wasting a thought on him.</p>
               <p>I found no trouble in regard to lodgings, readily engaging a scantily furnished
                  room in an obscure and quiet street. After making the necessary arrangements about
                  coal and candles, I went to bed early, and enjoyed a quiet sleep.</p>
               <p>I started early in the morning to seek employment. I found printing-houses enough,
                  but no vacancy at a case, and became rather disheartened. As I was wandering along
                  I came to Rathbone Place, and looking up saw that I was at No. 38. I saw the sign
                  of Winsor &amp; Newton, the leading artists' colormen in London, and in fact in
                  all Europe. As I knew that Paul Bagby used their tube colors in preference to all
                  others, it occurred to me that he might deal there direct, so I went in and asked
                  his address. One of the shopmen was kind enough to write down the street and
                  number for me, and to tell me the distance, and by what omnibuses I would reach
                  nearest the spot. I set off, and in the course of a half hour was at Paul's
                  studio.</p>
               <p>It was <choice>
                     <sic>sitnated</sic>
                     <corr>situated</corr>
                  </choice> on the first floor of a rather handsome house, in a fashionable
                  thoroughfare. I climbed the stairs, and seeing the words, "Mr. P. Bagby, Artist,"
                  on a door, knocked. The summons not being answered, I repeated it, when the door
                  suddenly opened. A tall man, his face nearly covered with a thick beard, grasped
                  the door-knob with one hand, and held his palette, brushes and mahl-stick with the
                  other.</p>
               <p>The bearded gentleman, whom I did not at all know, inquired my business by the
                  monosyllable, sharply uttered, "Well?"</p>
               <p>I was about to apologize, and state whom I expected to find there, when he
                  released the door-knob, grasped me by the hand, and dragged me into the room.</p>
               <p>"Why, what wind blew <emph>you</emph> here, Ambrose?" he asked, as we mutually
                  recognized each other. "You're the last one I expected to see."</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you that," I answered, "when I am quite sure this is Mr. Paul Bagby,
                  and not el Conde O'Samayer."</p>
               <p>He laughed.</p>
               <p>"All your provincial friends shave, I suppose; but London just now is visited with
                  an overflow of beard. Esau is a man-about-town. But you shall dine with me to-day.
                  As the dinner hour is some time off, we'll have a famous confabulation first."</p>
               <p>He turned the key in the door.</p>
               <p>"There, bring yourself to an anchor in that easy chair. I won't see any one until
                  we've had our talk out, that's<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6403-00000037"/> flat. Tell
                  me what brought you here, and I'll listen while I work away on the face of this
                  fat dowager. It would be a superb portrait, only it lacks color—on the nose. If I
                  only dared to paint her grace's proboscis in all its radiant glory, it would it
                  would illuminate the place like ten wax candles. But, proceed. As my Yankee friend
                  and patron, Archbold, would say, 'Go a-head!'"</p>
               <p>"Do you know my early history?"</p>
               <p>"Bits of it. Found like Moses in the bulrushes, or something—wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"I'd better begin at the beginning, so you'll understand what follows"</p>
               <p>"By all means. Begin at the beginning, and Cousin Sally Dilliard it as little as
                  you can."</p>
               <p>"What's that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, one of Archbold's queer stories. I'll recite it for you at another time.
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Commencez mon ami!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>I narrated briefly the main points of my life, he commenting from time to time.
                  When I came to my parting shot at the earl, and expressed my regret at my folly,
                  he said:</p>
               <p>"Don't concern yourself. He and I are no more friends, and I defy him."</p>
               <p>"Now," said I, when I had closed, "What do you think of it all?"</p>
               <p>"Think! why that you would have been a mine of wealth to Mrs. Radcliffe. You are
                  no doubt the long-lost heir to the crown of China, and I expect, on your accession
                  to the throne of your august ancestors, to be appointed court-painter, with an
                  income of a million a minute. Seriously, I see no mode at present of fathoming the
                  mystery. If we had that packet. As this new play of Richelieu says, 'your witness
                  must be that same dispatch.' But I can possibly assist you a little. Have you a
                  copy of those inscriptions with you?"</p>
               <p>"I have the things themselves with me, that is, the ring and brooch."</p>
               <p>Very absurd that; leave them here or you may lose them. Let me see—yes, copy them
                  on that slip of paper for me. I remember 'Bugunda Jawa'—let me have the others. I
                  know a sort of Dr. Dryasdust who knows several times more languages than you—can
                  talk fluently in fifty tongues or more, and yet in general he hasn't words enough
                  to throw at a dog. I'll make it my special business to see him to-night, and force
                  him to translate. But where are you staying?"</p>
               <p>I told him. He knew the place very well, apparently, for he curled his lip, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Miserable locality. You must have better lodgings."</p>
               <p>"They're fully as good as prudence warrants at present."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, they're not. Bring your traps—they're portable enough, I fancy—here.
                  There is a good bed in the other room, which is principally used by friends of
                  mine—late gentlemen, benighted on this side of town. There is a chest of drawers
                  for your clothes, a small drawer in it, with a lock and key, for your papers and
                  trinkets. Stay with me until you get settled employment, and as long after as you
                  like."</p>
               <p>"You are very kind, and I thank you; but a poor printer shouldn't lodge with a
                  fashionable artist."</p>
               <p>"Printer! why, man, it is an art imperial; the monarch of all crafts and
                  mysteries. If I were not an artist, I would be a printer. Then, you're the heir to
                  the empire of China, you know and, if your majesty will deign—but you must come.
                  If you don't, you shan't see Zara."</p>
               <p>"Zara!"</p>
               <p>"Ha!" I thought I should bring you. Fetch your things to-morrow, and take
                  possession, and you shall see the pretty Spaniard."</p>
               <p>"Where is she? Tell me about her—and him."</p>
               <p>"About her—very easy. About him—impossible! Zara is at a ladies' school in the
                  suburbs—a parlor boarder. She is under the joint guardianship of another and
                  myself. Several months after I saw Espinel in the Park—as I wrote you, you know—I
                  met him at a <foreign xml:lang="ITA">conversazione</foreign>. I found that he was
                  very intimate with the Duke of Sillingbourne, one of my patrons. He declared that
                  he did not recognize me, when he saw me in the Park, and I had no reason to doubt
                  his word. We became intimate. I soon learned that he was a Spanish nobleman, and
                  had been a monk, but had been released from his vows, for family reasons, shortly
                  before he came to England. I cannot tell you his object here, nor who Zara really
                  is; for that is a secret confined to two others beside himself—that is, to the
                  Duke and me. All that I can tell you is, that she is his niece."</p>
               <p>"Then your old conjecture proved to be right after all."</p>
               <p>"Precisely so. Just previous to my last letter to you, Espinel went from his
                  lodgings one day for a stroll, and never returned. We have traced him to a certain
                  part of London, where he was met by a person, whose description tallies with that
                  of Osborne; but your information that he was so many miles off on that day has
                  relieved him."</p>
               <p>"I am not so sure," I said, "but what, from my friendship to you, the object of my
                  inquiries, carelessly made though they were, may have been suspected; and I may
                  have been intentionally misinformed."</p>
               <p>"That must be looked to. I thought you wrote to me from personal knowledge. But
                  come here early in the morning, and we'll see Zara."</p>
               <p>About ten o'clock next morning I removed my scanty luggage to Paul's apartments,
                  and took possession of the chamber assigned to me. I had no more than locked up
                  Sharp's letter and my trinkets in one of the drawers, <choice>
                     <sic>befor</sic>
                     <corr>before</corr>
                  </choice> Paul called me into the studio. There I saw a tall, thin and
                  sickly-looking, but nevertheless commanding old gentleman, who scanned with
                  earnest but not offensive curiosity.</p>
               <p>"Ambrose," said Paul, "I wish to present you to the Duke of Sillingbourne. This,
                  your grace, is Mr. Fecit, of whom I spoke."</p>
               <p>The Duke shook my hand.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to meet you, young gentleman," said his grace. "I may as well mention
                  that it is not merely your singular history, which Mr. Bagby has confidentially
                  mentioned, which interests me; but the acquirements which he tells me that you
                  possess, and your general character."</p>
               <p>I bowed; I, a poor young printer, and a foundling, complimented by a duke. It was
                  like a dream.</p>
               <p>"I have had my Œdipus at work on your riddle," said Paul. "The words of the
                  Countess were Malay. 'Baganda Jawa,' mean literally, 'The Prince of Java.' The
                  inscriptions, the Professor says, are in the Korinchi character, though they give
                  Malay words. The Malays, it appears, use the Arabic<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6403-00000038"/> bic characters, but it is supposed that they
                  formerly used the Korinchi letters. The words on the ring are, 'chinchin baganda,'
                  meaning 'the prince's ring;' and the letters on the brooch stand for 'piniti
                  baganda,' 'the prince's pin.' After all, it does not amount to much."</p>
               <p>"It is a step in the investigation," remarked the Duke.</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible," I inquired "that I am Javanese?"</p>
               <p>"Quite impossible, I should say," answered Paul. "The Javanese face belongs to a
                  peculiarly marked race; its features are as distinctive as those of the Mongolian
                  or African. Yours bears no resemblance to it whatever. Your face is as thoroughly
                  European as mine. But we must visit Zara, and you had better get ready."</p>
               <p>It was not long before I made the necessary changes in my dress, and rejoined
                  them. As we were going down stairs, I said apart to Paul:</p>
               <p>"Do you know that I have been thinking a deal about the old Countess noticing my
                  ear."</p>
               <p>"Poh! don't let that mislead you. Your ear is slightly malformed; the back of the
                  lobe is drawn tightly to the jaw. She has a quick eye, and was attracted by an
                  unusual trifle. The oddity of the thing struck her—that was all."</p>
               <p>"The Earl, you know," I suggested, "asked me if I were quite sure I was born in
                  England."</p>
               <p>"Merely because he didn't know what else to say."</p>
               <p>I had great confidence in Paul's judgment, but I weighed all these little things
                  in my mind a great deal.</p>
               <p>We soon reached the "Home Seminary," and on sending up our names, the principal, a
                  formal and precise middle-aged maiden lady, joined us. With a triple air,
                  compounded of deference to the Duke, courtesy to Paul, and graciousness to me, she
                  engaged us in conversation while Zara was summoned from the school-room.</p>
               <p>Presently the door opened—Zara made her appearance, hesitated at the sight of a
                  stranger, and then advancing, laid her hands in those of the duke and Paul.</p>
               <p>She had grown in height, but had not changed in features. Though not yet fourteen
                  years of age, she had reached the height of woman, and had a woman's form,
                  although lacking in roundness of outline. And she was so beautiful. I fairly drank
                  in her wondrous beauty, as I had done between three and four years before on the
                  high road to Puttenham.</p>
               <p>"You don't recognize old friends, Zara," said Paul, smiling. "Have you forgotten
                  Ambrose Fecit?"</p>
               <p>Her eyes dilated, the blood rushed to her face—a single glance, and she sprang to
                  me impulsively, and grasping both of my hands, carried them to her lips.</p>
               <p>She recovered herself presently, and seeing the scandalized look of the lady
                  principal, said, with the slightest amount of foreign accent in her speech:</p>
               <p>"It is my good adopted brother, Madame; and my dear uncle loved him so much."</p>
               <p>"Come, Mr. Bagby," said the Duke, "we will leave these youngsters to talk awhile.
                  They havn't seen each other for so long, that an hour will be little enough for
                  their conversation. Miss Myrtle, I have heard much in praise of the perfect
                  arrangement of this institution. Will you honor me by taking ing my arm, and
                  accompany us over the house and grounds?"</p>
               <p>Miss Myrtle was only too much delighted to oblige his grace, and so Zara and
                  myself were left together.</p>
               <p>It was delightful to sit there and listen to the dear child, as with her dark,
                  lustrous eyes beaming with pleasure, she told me the simple story of her life from
                  the time we parted until then. I returned this with much of what had happened to
                  me, and there we both chatted with full hearts—both children of mystery—both
                  feathers blown hither and thither by the <choice>
                     <sic>brseze</sic>
                     <corr>breeze</corr>
                  </choice>, ignorant of our origin, and uncertain of the future. What a dear memory
                  that hour is even now! We could scarcely believe our hour had passed when the Duke
                  and Miss Myrtle, followed by Paul, returned.</p>
               <p>"Now, Zara," said his grace, "I have made arrangements with Miss Myrtle, by which
                  Ambrose will spend an hour with you on every Saturday afternoon; and you must
                  continue to be a good girl as Miss Myrtle says you have been hitherto."</p>
               <p>"She is very docile, your grace, and all her teachers and school-mates are
                  delighted with her. I hope, the Count, her father, is well."</p>
               <p>The Duke bowed to avoid an answer, and Zara's lip quivered. She knew, then, of her
                  uncle's disappearance.</p>
               <p>As we retired, Zara and I were somewhat in the rear of the others—Miss Myrtle
                  relaxing her dignity so far in favor of a duke as to attend his grace to the
                  door—and I bent over and kissed Zara on the forehead. She drew down my head
                  gently, pressed her lips to my cheek, and then, frightened at her own temerity,
                  glided blushingly away.</p>
               <p>Miss Myrtle was horrified to find that Miss Espinel had gone in without bidding
                  her noble guardian a respectful farewell.</p>
               <p>The Duke undertook to set us down at the studio. On our way there, he said to
                  me:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Fecit, you must really abandon your tr— business for the present."</p>
               <p>"How shall I live, your grace, without a mortifying sense of dependence on
                  others?"</p>
               <p>"That is easily arranged, sir, without the necessity of your incurring any
                  obligation. I have at present no secretary. It is the situation of a gentleman. We
                  shall not disagree about the amount of salary attached. Will you accept the
                  position?"</p>
               <p>Young as I was I had the power of prompt decision, but the proffer was one I could
                  not well refuse; so I answered:</p>
               <p>"I think I understand your grace. I accept your kindness gratefully, and shall not
                  forget the obligation."</p>
               <p>I was soon installed as his grace's secretary. It was merely a delicate way of
                  providing for my support. The Duke had very little correspondence, was not in
                  public life beyond his duties as a peer of the realm, and lived retired from the
                  busy world. His financial affairs were under his steward's supervision, and I had
                  next to nothing to do. The greater part of my time was spent with Paul Bagby, in
                  whose charge my papers and trinkets remained, with the exception of hours devoted
                  to my favorite study, and the pleasant ones passed with Zara on the afternoon of
                  each Saturday.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Introducing a new acquaintance and more mystery.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>In despite of the privacy of life sought by the Duke, his grace had numerous
                  visitors. While I was nominally acting as secretary, although my years and station
                  gave me no intimacy with these, yet the contact with so many of high rank and
                  position was likely to be useful. Paul pointed out to me the chance that this
                  speaking acquaintanceship with distinguished personages might turn to account at
                  some time. I did not build on that, but I felt that the casual conversations I
                  held with these men, all of them well-bred, and the insensible example of their
                  manner, served to give me greater personal confidence, and ease of demeanor. My
                  intimacies ran in another way. Among Paul's many acquaintances I found some who,
                  without being entirely congenial, attracted me. These were artists and literary
                  men half way up the ladder of reputation—men who had undergone a deal of privation
                  on the road to distinction, and who had a certain gay and almost reckless manner
                  which amused me exceedingly Now and then some of them seemed to remember that they
                  had a body to care for in this world, and even a soul to care for in the world to
                  come; but the majority lived for to-day solely, taking good and ill-fortune with <choice>
                     <sic>philsophical</sic>
                     <corr>philosophical</corr>
                  </choice> indifference. Paul, at first, was rather uneasy at my taking so kindly
                  to these roistering fellows; but he possibly reflected that I had no inclination
                  to semi-vagabondism, that I drank but sparingly, and had the habits of quiet life,
                  for he soon ceased to trouble me with advice about my companionship.</p>
               <p>One afternoon I had been dawdling about the studios of several artists, and wound
                  up by a visit to Paul's apartments. The first thing that I noticed there was a
                  sketch in oil, which I knew was not in Paul's style. It represented a scene in an
                  eastern court, showing the audience given by the ruler. So far there was nothing
                  striking about the composition. But what was surprising was the fact that the face
                  and costume of the vizier beside the throne was unmistakably that of the Baganda
                  Jawa, having even the very pose of the figure in the portrait at Landy's
                  Castle.</p>
               <p>"Wonder away, old fellow!" said Paul, as he caught my eye, "you can't possibly
                  wonder more than I do."</p>
               <p>"But where did you get it, and what does it mean?"</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you where I got it. I received a note yesterday from a German artist,
                  named Diemer. I never heard of the man before. He said that he was a stranger
                  here, and in distress; that he knew me by reputation, and thought if I would call
                  that I could render him a service with little inconvenience to myself. Well, I
                  went. He has miserable lodgings enough in a house over in Milton street, up three
                  pair back. I found him in bed. He said that he was subject to sudden attacks of
                  paralysis of the lower limbs, accompanied by neuralgia in the face. He had been
                  taken off his pins the week before, but expected the disease would pass off in a
                  day or so. He had come to England from Dusseldorf, hoping to find sale for his
                  pictures, of which he had two <choice>
                     <sic>comyleted</sic>
                     <corr>completed</corr>
                  </choice>, together with the studies for several more. The pictures were not
                  much—a little clever, perhaps—both bearing the Dusseldorf stamp, and both in
                  entirely different styles of treatment. This sketch struck me more than the
                  pictures. He says it is a mere fancy picture, but I don't believe it. I borrowed
                  it to show you. I tried to pump him, but failed. And now you've had the whole
                  story."</p>
               <p>'I should like to see him."</p>
               <p>"So you shall. I am going to return the sketch, and you can accompany me. You must
                  wait awhile, however, as he prefers to receive visitors at night it seems."</p>
               <p>At night-fall we-started. The German was found in a chair, into which he told us
                  he had been helped, and was seated before an easel, on which was an unfinished
                  picture, with the paint dry, as though no one had worked on it recently.</p>
               <p>I did not notice that particularly then, but I recalled the fact afterward. The
                  artist himself made a rather queer picture. His face and jaws were muffled up in
                  cloths, to sustain the anodyne applications, as he told us, that were necessary in
                  his case. From these his hair escaped in one or two places, but all the features
                  of his face that were visible were his eyes, his beard and heavy moustache, and a
                  huge, red nose. The face, or what little we could see of it, was strange; but the
                  eyes seemed wondrous familiar, though I could not tell where I had seen them
                  before.</p>
               <p>I addressed the man in German, but he spoke a kind of patois, very difficult to
                  make out. His English I could understand better, so we used that. Our conversation
                  turned upon the strange similarity between the face of the vizeer in the sketch
                  and mine. He told me so often that this similarity was entirely accidental, that I
                  felt quite sure it was not. I offered to buy the sketch, but he replied that it
                  was a study—the base of a picture in which other figures would be introduced to
                  complete the story. Hence it was not for sale.</p>
               <p>I asked him the locality intended.</p>
               <p>He hesitated, looked at the sketch, which we had brought back with us, and said,
                  "Persia."</p>
               <p>"You'll have to alter the costume, then," I remarked. "The dresses are
                  Javanese."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so?" he inquired.</p>
               <p>"I am sure of it," I said; "you will find them in the quarto book of plates
                  appended to Sir Stamford Raffles's book on Java."</p>
               <p>He made no answer to this, and after a little more conversation we left. As we
                  were going he specially invited me to come speedily again, which I promised to
                  do.</p>
               <p>"How did you learn about the costume?" asked Paul, as we were going homeward.</p>
               <p>"By inspection. The book I cited is in the Duke's library."</p>
               <p>"What do you think of my German?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what to think, but I intend to visit him. Perhaps he may drop
                  something at some time or other."</p>
               <p>"Do you know, Ambrose," resumed Paul, after we had walked some distance further in
                  silence, "I think I have seen this Herr Diemer somewhere before."</p>
               <p>"I have seen his eyes," I rejoined, "though I can't tell where. I intend to find
                  out."</p>
               <p>And so I did, but not in a hurry, nor in the way I expected. I could learn<pb
                     n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6403-00000040"/> nothing at my various visits, for I
                  called on him frequently during evenings, but I patiently waited. I noticed one
                  thing more, namely, that though the palsy went off, the neuralgia remained, for
                  the head of Herr Diemer was kept muffled, and some kind of tincture freely
                  applied.</p>
               <p>One evening when I called I found him in bed. He told me that he had just
                  experienced another attack of palsy in the legs, and asked me to remain awhile. I
                  had gotten to be quite familiar with him, but on that night I found him even more
                  communicative than usual. I drew him on, and at length brought up the subject of
                  the sketch.</p>
               <p>"I can tell you now," said he, "where I must have caught the face so like yours.
                  There, hand me down the bottle of Rhine wine from yonder cupboard, and a couple of
                  glasses. Do you ever drink Rhenish?"</p>
               <p>"Rarely," I answered.</p>
               <p>"It is good for the health. Try it."</p>
               <p>I sipped it, and told him that it had a peculiar flavor which I did not like.</p>
               <p>"It will change when you drink the first glass," he said.</p>
               <p>I drank a glass as he desired, but it seemed to me as though the taste grew
                  stronger at every mouthful. He went on, meanwhile, to tell me how he had been in
                  England some years before, and while in the southwestern part had visited the
                  various show-places, among the rest, Landys Castle The narrative, though tedious,
                  and full of digressions, was interesting, because I was trying to detect where the
                  falsehood lay; but I felt all the while a drowsiness stealing over me.</p>
               <p>"The wine has affected you," he said. "It is headier than it seems, but it will
                  pass away."</p>
               <p>It did not, however. I grew drowsier every moment.</p>
               <p>"I can remedy that," said he. "Pray hand me that bottle and sponge from the table.
                  It contains ammonia and other things that I use to clear the head in such
                  cases."</p>
               <p>He poured out a liquid, with a peculiar, penetrating odor, on the sponge, and
                  loosely folded it in a napkin.</p>
               <p>"There," said he, "let me hold that to your nostrils. Draw it in strong a few
                  times."</p>
               <p>I obeyed him, for I was desirous of getting to the end of his story. I felt my
                  head soothed, but not cleared. I grew more drowsy, and made an ineffectual attempt
                  to remove the sponge. He held it firmly, and I struggled slightly. As I did so the
                  cover and false nose fell from his face. I recognized Osborne, and at the same
                  moment lost both sense and motion.</p>

               <p>My return to consciousness showed me that I was lying in bed. There was a dull
                  light around me, which came apparently from a round hole at a short distance. I
                  felt for the edges of the bed. One was clear, the other was bordered by a cold
                  wall. I arose, and stepped on the floor As soon as I could determine the point, I
                  found that I was in a narrow room, and that the hole was in the door, immovable,
                  and apparently fastened from the outside. I shouted aloud, but received no answer.
                  At length, I heard a number of cries, confused and smothered, with a dull echo, as
                  though they came from a number of apartments opening on a common corridor.</p>
               <p>I thought it must be all a dream; but a second thought showed that it was real,
                  for in a dream we never doubt whether we are dreaming or not. Where, then, could I
                  be?</p>
               <p>By the dim light I saw the apartment was narrow, high, and arched. The narrow bed
                  on which I had lain was a hard mattress, resting upon a frame, or lattice-work of
                  strips of iron, and let into the wall at the head and foot. There was no other
                  furniture in the place, not even a chair. Back of the bed was a door which would
                  not open. I tugged at it, when it slid, and showed a private closet about two feet
                  square. Though there was no trace of fire-place, furnace; nor flue, the
                  temperature of the apartment was mild.</p>
               <p>Could it be the cell of a prison? I thought not. There was a grated window high up
                  and beyond my reach, over my bed; but the grating was not made prison-fashion,
                  being merely a piece of ornamental iron-work.</p>
               <p>I tried again to call the attention of some one, but received no response. I put
                  my hand to my head in thought, and to my surprise and dismay, discovered that my
                  head had been shaved close. In an instant the truth flashed over me.</p>
               <p>I was in a lunatic asylum.</p>
               <p>I shuddered, and felt a sickening sensation crawl over me. All the stories I had
                  read concerning unhappy victims who had been buried in these horrible bastiles,
                  recurred to my memory. I staggered to the bed, yielding to a nervous prostration,
                  and cried like a child—no, not like a child; but with the noiseless, burning,
                  bleeding, agonizing tears of a man.</p>
               <p>Those tears relieved me. My mind grew clearer, and I sat myself down to
                  deliberately shape some plan of action. I could see no way visible, nor even
                  conjecture any. I drew the counterpane over me, and lay there. Singularly enough,
                  it was not long before I fell fast asleep.</p>
               <p>It must have been near day when I awoke. It was several minutes before I could
                  realize that I was shut up in a cell, a helpless prisoner. The glimmering light
                  still came through a hole in the door, showing that there must be a light burning
                  all night in the corridor, and I looked at it as a sort of comfort.</p>
               <p>Close by the head of my bed there was a rat gnawing in the wall. It seemed a
                  singular taste of his, too. I could hear his teeth working away at the mortar
                  between the bricks. If I could only pick so! But I had nothing—not even a rusty
                  nail. Ha! my pocket knife!</p>
               <p>I felt around. Clothing was on the bed, but not mine. It felt as though made of
                  some coarse cloth. They had stripped me while I was insensible, and left me these
                  instead. I laughed convulsively at my own folly. Why, of course they would leave
                  their prisoner no tool, no weapon—they were too wise for that. Still the gnawing
                  went on. How I envied the rat his sharp teeth!</p>
               <p>Day came at length, the light in the corridor was extinguished, and the sunlight,
                  crawling in through the grating in the upper part of the cell, met and wrestled
                  with the colder rays that crept in at the little hole in the door. I could see the
                  cell very clearly then<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6403-00000041"/> It was about six
                  feet by eight; the walls were naked, plastered rough-cast in mortar, and washed
                  with lime. I examined the closet to see if I could communicate with my
                  fellow-prisoners by that way, but the iron drain-pipe ran outwards and downwards,
                  and was set firmly in cement.</p>
               <p>The rat stopped his gnawing with the approach of light.</p>
               <p>About an hour after day-break, the light before the round hole was darkened, a key
                  turned in a lock, a square portion of the door below the hole was let down,
                  forming a kind of shelf, and a tin can, with a square ingot of bread was placed
                  upon it. A face appeared at the aperture, the features stolid, coarse, and by no
                  means well-favored.</p>
               <p>"Breakfuss!" growled the newcomer.</p>
               <p>"Pray," said I, "why am I here, and what place is this?"</p>
               <p>"You're a new man, an' doesn't know the rules," was the reply. "No talkin' of
                  payshins to attendins, nor wisy warsy, which I doesn't mean to explain to you no
                  more. I'm a goin' of my rouns. If the tin's here empty when I comes back, I takes
                  it away. If the wittals is here, why I takes them away. Them's the rules."</p>
               <p>The face disappeared.</p>
               <p>I reflected a moment. Now, I had not much appetite under the circumstances, yet it
                  would be rank folly to starve myself; I might want all my strength. I tried the
                  bread—it was not unpalatable. The tea was liberally qualified with sugar and
                  milk—it was of a fair quality. I ate the one, and drank the other—a meagre
                  breakfast, quality considered, but sufficient in quantity. I laid the tin cup on
                  the shelf, and looked through the aperture. The hall was about six feet wide. As
                  far as I could see, there appeared to be no rooms on the opposite side, and there
                  were certainly no doors there. I put my head through the aperture—the man was
                  returning, and I withdrew it.</p>
               <p>He came up to take the can.</p>
               <p>"See here," said he, "keep your head inside, or I'll punch it. It's agin
                  rules."</p>
               <p>"To punch my head?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>The man grinned, and closed the aperture. As he locked it, I heard him mutter to
                  himself:</p>
               <p>"Rum young chap that; werry."</p>
               <p>I put on the clothes which lay on the bed—a loose, grey jacket, with strings
                  instead of buttons, and loose, wide trousers—and then sat down. I reflected
                  carefully on the whole affair, and at length came to the conclusion that the best
                  thing to do was to remain quiet, and let events take their course. In fact nothing
                  else could well be done; but men under such circumstances are not always rational
                  in act. I took the common sense view of the case, and acted accordingly. Had I
                  screamed, yelled or raved, it wouldn't have been an unusual thing to have done;
                  but I mastered all impulses of that kind. My first attempt would be to gain a
                  gradual intimacy with my grim jailor. I did not hope much to soften him. He would
                  scarcely have been placed there if made of penetrable stuff; but I hoped to throw
                  him off his guard, and by that means pick up something as to the place of my
                  detention, and the object of my imprisonment.</p>
               <p>I was not without conviction as to who was the author of my confinement. That was
                  easy enough. Mr. Osborne was, of course, the Earl's agent, and as he had been
                  concerned in putting away Espinel, who might, indeed, be there under the same roof
                  with me, the cause of our imprisonment was similar.</p>
               <p>Espinel was evidently the master of some secret highly dangerous to the Earl of
                  Landys, and his lordship thought me to be privy to it. I assumed that his mistake
                  would be discovered, and that my release would come at some time, and all I could
                  do meanwhile was to wait.</p>
               <p>At noon the same face made its appearance; a pan of soup was put on the shelf, and
                  a horn spoon and large slice of bread placed alongside of it. It was not part of
                  the system to starve me, at all events, for the soup was good, and there was
                  enough of it.</p>
               <p>I kept up my plan of amusing my keeper, and as he was taking away the pan and
                  spoon I said to him, in a mock dramatic style, "remove the banquet." He grinned
                  again, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>Supper was similar to breakfast; but a tin full of water was added, which I
                  retained, understanding it to be for drink during the night, and the remainder for
                  ablution in the morning.</p>
               <p>I lay down to sleep that night with a terrible sense of loneliness and weariness.
                  About midnight I awakened, and felt no more disposition to sleep. The rat had
                  resumed his work at my bed-head. I lay and listened to him, or got up and paced
                  the narrow limits of my cell, and thus the dreary night passed away.</p>
               <p>The solitude and want of occupation threatened to make me really mad. So on the
                  third day I asked the attendant, as he brought my dinner, if I could have a
                  book.</p>
               <p>"Talkin' to attendins is agin the rules," he answered.</p>
               <p>"Oh, very well," said I. "All right; but if anybody calls, send up their
                  cards."</p>
               <p>He grinned as usual, and left.</p>
               <p>So then I was to be buried alive there; no companionship, no books, no relief. I
                  sat on the bed-side and thought of my early days; of honest old John Guttenberg
                  and his wife, of Mary, of my schoolmates, of the heaths and fields on the
                  outskirts of Puttenham, and of my meeting with Espinel and Zara. Zara! at the
                  thought of her, and the pleasant life I had led for a short while before, my tears
                  flowed again. Those tears seemed to save me from frenzy.</p>
               <p>There were two spiders, rivals in trade, who had established fly-traps far up in
                  the cell, in opposite corners. I watched them curiously, and speculated as to what
                  kept them awake at that season, and alive at any time, for the place was too
                  gloomy for flies. Then I got in the habit of dozing by day, and lying awake at
                  night, waiting for the rat to begin. There was companionship in him. About
                  mid-night he would commence work, and keep on indefatigably until day-break He was
                  an industrious rodent. I tried to make a calculation how long it would be,
                  admitting that he wore off the thousandth part of an inch from his teeth every
                  night, before he would get them even with his jaw, and so perish miserably. Then I
                  should lose the companionship of his labor, and have neither company nor
                  amusement. I grew very anxious to see that rat.</p>
               <p>About six weeks had passed away in the same monotonous round. Once a week,
                  however, my attendant thrust<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6403-00000042"/> a brush and
                  narrow dust-pan through the square aperture, just after breakfast, with the
                  words:</p>
               <p>"Sweep your room!"</p>
               <p>That was a great luxury. I used to protract the operation as much as possible. The
                  day after the sweeping, the coarse bed linen was changed. I made my bed, as the
                  door never opened.</p>
               <p>About six weeks had passed, as I said, when I thought I had secured a sufficient
                  amount of my jailor's good will by my forced fun, to get him to listen to me. So
                  when he came that day to remove my dinner dish, I whispered:</p>
               <p>"The Duke of Sellingbourne would give a hundred pounds to find where I am."</p>
               <p>The man chuckled, and before he closed the aperture, put his thumb to his nose,
                  and waved his fingers in a derisive motion, classic through age, but not
                  picturesque. I thought the bait might still be swallowed; but when one, two,
                  three, four weeks had gone, and he did not in any way allude to the offer, I began
                  to despair.</p>
               <p>At length, one night it struck me that my rat had nearly gnawed his way through,
                  the sound of his teeth growing plainer and plainer. I listened, and heard small
                  pieces of the plaster falling to the floor. I leaned over the bed and tried to
                  peer underneath, but the light from the corridor was too dim. Suddenly the truth
                  flashed upon me. Some one from the next cell was breaking into mine.</p>
               <p>I was startled. This might be a real maniac, desperate and dangerous. Should I cry
                  out? It might be a fellow-prisoner trying to escape. And yet what folly, merely to
                  get from one dungeon into the next. I determined to wait and watch.</p>
               <p>The loosened bricks were cautiously removed. Some one was coming through. I bent
                  over and grasped the intruder by the shoulder, saying:</p>
               <p>"Who are you? What do you want?"</p>
               <p>The only reply was a despairing groan. I spoke again.</p>
               <p>"Tell me who you are. I am immured in this cell. Are you a prisoner too?"</p>
               <p>A hoarse whisper answered me:</p>
               <p>"Yes. Santa Maria! is there another cell yet?"</p>
               <p>"Come through," I whispered, for I thought I recognized the voice.</p>
               <p>The man crawled in, and we were presently standing together on the floor of the
                  cell.</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" he whispered.</p>
               <p>"Ambrose Fecit."</p>
               <p>"Cosa rara! Caspita! I am Espinel."</p>
               <p>We hurriedly consulted together. He had been under the hope that the one left was
                  the last cell on the range, and had worked through his own and the others
                  succeeding, which happened to be vacant, by means of a strip of iron which he had
                  detached from his bedstead. He had been at work for over four months; but a part
                  of the time his labor had been interrupted by the tenancy of an intermediate
                  apartment. He thought, if mine were the last cell, we could get through in four to
                  six weeks more.</p>
               <p>"But why," I inquired, "did you not try the outer wall, the back part of the
                  cell?"</p>
               <p>"Because I know the plan of the building. It is an oblong quadrangle, the cells
                  backing on a garden well-hole, from which there would be no escape There is a <choice>
                     <sic>corirdor</sic>
                     <corr>corridor</corr>
                  </choice> completely around, and we can get into it at the end without attracting
                  observation. Then we must fight, if necessary."</p>
               <p>I was too impatient to wait for this slow burrowing, and struck on a bolder
                  plan.</p>
               <p>"Do they ever open the cell doors?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"I think not," he answered, "unless you are sick. I was unwell the week after I
                  came here, and the doctor, the keeper of the place, I think, came and prescribed
                  for me. That was the only time my cell has been opened."</p>
               <p>"We might seize him, and force our way."</p>
               <p>"No! he is always armed, and they are continually on the watch."</p>
               <p>"Armed! so much the better. With his arms we can fight our way out."</p>
               <p>"But how to take them."</p>
               <p>"I will be sick to-morrow. Watch, and when the attendant goes to bring the doctor,
                  arrange your bed clothes so that a passing glance would make any one think you
                  were lying there, remove the bricks and come to me at once."</p>
               <p>"And then?"</p>
               <p>"And then I will show you on the instant what to do. Now go, and replace the
                  bricks carefully."</p>
               <p>He left, and I quietly went to bed, where I lay awake, quietly maturing my plan,
                  and leaving it to be modified by circumstances. I fell asleep at length, but woke
                  at day-light.</p>
               <p>I did not go to the grate when the attendant came, but lay under the covers with
                  my clothes on, tossing and moaning as though in great pain.</p>
               <p>"Sick?" inquired he.</p>
               <p>I muttered that I was dying—a doctor.</p>
               <p>He removed the victuals, and I heard him hurry off. In a couple of minutes Espinel
                  was in my cell. It was the first time that I had seen him since our imprisonment
                  by day-light, and a very bearded savage he was, to be sure.</p>
               <p>The door of the cell was not in the centre, but a little to the right. I placed
                  Espinel on the side next its hinges, close against the wall, and crouched down.
                  Presently, some one came to the door, and I resumed my tossing and moaning. I
                  heard the attendant say:</p>
               <p>"Shall I wait, sir?"</p>
               <p>The face of the doctor placed itself at the hole.</p>
               <p>"No," said a strange voice, "I shan't want you, Bill. If I do I'll call. Go on
                  with your rounds."</p>
               <p>As he opened the door I rolled in a fresh paroxysm of simulated agony, so as to
                  draw his gaze on me. He came forward to the bed, and said, sharply:</p>
               <p>"Now, then, Number Twenty-eight, what appears to be the matter with you?"</p>
               <p>The answer was given in a startling way. Espinel leaped upon him like a tiger, and
                  clasped his throat so tightly that not only could he not cry out, but was in
                  imminent danger of strangulation. His face began to blacken, his tongue protruded,
                  his eyes seemed bursting from their sockets, and his arms made convulsive efforts
                  to free himself from that fearful grasp. I passed my hands over his person. There
                  were a pair of small pistols in his skirt-pockets, and a short club, like a
                  constable's mace, in his bosom. As I secured these, he fainted. We saw that he was
                  not dead. Espinel released<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6403-00000043"/> leased his
                  throat. We gagged him with a rude contrivance made of the piece of broken iron
                  brought by Espinel, and his own cravat; and hastily tying his hands and feet with
                  strips torn from the sheets, we threw him on the bed, and covered him with the
                  counterpane. I then went to the door and peered out. The attendant was delivering
                  food at the cell doors. I imitated the doctor's peremptory tone as near as I
                  could, and called out:</p>
               <p>"Bill."</p>
               <p>He came at the summons. As he neared us I handed a pistol and the club to Espinel,
                  and with the other pistol cocked stood waiting. As Bill came, I sprang out, and my
                  left hand was on his collar, and my right had the remaining pistol at his head in
                  an instant.</p>
               <p>He was too much petrified by terror, which intensified at the sight of Espinel, to
                  make any attempt at escape.</p>
               <p>"Silence!" I said sternly, "if you value your life. You know what this pistol
                  holds; it is cocked, and my finger on the trigger. A cry, a motion more than I bid
                  you to make, and I spatter the floor with your brains. We will not be retaken
                  alive. You must lead us out by the shortest and safest way. Attempt to betray us,
                  and I kill you on the spot. Now, lead us out."</p>
               <p>"I hadn't the keys of the private doors, sir; the doctor has 'em," he replied,
                  trembling.</p>
               <p>"Espinel, get them."</p>
               <p>The Spaniard re-entered the cell to rifle the doctor's pockets, and soon
                  re-entered with the keys.</p>
               <p>"Now," said I, "quickly and silently."</p>
               <p>With one hand on the collar of his coat, and the other grasping the pistol, I
                  followed him down stairs to a private entrance, with a double door. Espinel opened
                  these, and by my direction, closed and locked them after him. It was well to take
                  this precaution, for no sooner had we done so than a thundering upon them from the
                  inside showed we were pursued. We emerged on a back street, and led our man to a
                  corner where we dismissed him. He needed no advice to hurry off. We were now in a
                  crowded thoroughfare, where our strange, wild figures, no less than our dress,
                  drew a mob around us. Fortunately a policeman was near, and came up. We
                  surrendered ourselves to his custody, and desired to be transferred to Bow street.
                  It was not long before we were safe under the guardianship of the magistrates.</p>
               <p>Our story was soon told. Policemen were at once sent to the asylum, and messengers
                  despatched to seek the Duke, the Spanish minister, and Paul Bagby. The former came
                  back to report that the doctor had escaped, but that the attendants were in
                  custody. No direct charge was made against them—they were mere hirelings—but they
                  were held to testify. The messengers from our friends returned, followed by Paul
                  Bagby, and an attache of the Spanish legation. These identified us at once. Our
                  parole was taken to send sureties for our appearance against the doctor, if he
                  were apprehended; a coach was procured; and we were driven, amid the parting
                  cheers of the crowd, to the Duke's house.</p>
