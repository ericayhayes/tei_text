CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
STORY OF THE HAUNTED~ CASTLE.&#xD;
AUNT PHEBE continued her story:&#xD;
"Bad men fear haunted places. I knew there was a&#xD;
Castle 'near the coast that was believed to have 'ghostly&#xD;
visitors; and many were the stories of unearthly revel-&#xD;
lings through the halls of that spacious old building.&#xD;
Tli~ leg~iid of the Castle ran thus:&#xD;
"A great many years ago, an immensely rich miser&#xD;
lived there, who had a daughter of great beauty; her&#xD;
ha~nd s sought 'by wealthy and distinguished suitors,&#xD;
all o hom she turned aw~y without the coveted prise.&#xD;
She loved only one, and that was a Page in the house.&#xD;
He could play the harp and sing with more melody than&#xD;
the lovely maiden had ever heard before. The old man&#xD;
never suspicioned what was going on, until an occur-&#xD;
rence took place in the house Which brought the whole&#xD;
matter to light. The young lady was affianced to a&#xD;
young nobleman by 'the 'positive commandd of her father.&#xD;
The engagement had been made and arranged by the&#xD;
parents of the 'couple.&#xD;
"One evening this young nobleman: was in the' parIo~&#xD;
with his affianced. The Page was present. He seemed&#xD;
to be arranging the sheets of music for his' young mis~&#xD;
tress, and really paying little attention to what was&#xD;
going on Lu the room. The young lady excused herself&#xD;
&#xD;
MADELINE.&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
and withdrew for a moment, and the nobleman walked&#xD;
to a table, upon which was a decanter of wine. Pouring&#xD;
out a goblet full he turned to the Page and said, as he&#xD;
drank:&#xD;
"'Here is to your beautiful mistress and my affianc&amp;amp;t'&#xD;
"The Page walked boldly up to the the table, with a&#xD;
hai(ghty expression of contempt depicted' upon his face,&#xD;
and filling a goblet, said:&#xD;
"'May the young lady bye me with the intensity of&#xD;
feeling that she detests you, and may her devotion to&#xD;
me be as constant as her disgust is for the man who&#xD;
seeks to obtain his object by parental coercion, and not&#xD;
by any merit possessed by himself.'&#xD;
"The keen black eye of the Page evinced the anger&#xD;
he felt, as he drank the wine.&#xD;
"'What! ~jou dare insult me? villain, servant!'&#xD;
"At this moment the Page felled the nobh~ an to&#xD;
the floor with~ his fist; and he lay there sense~ ~' for&#xD;
some time. The proprietor of the house, hearing the&#xD;
noise in the parlor, rushed in to ascertain the cause.&#xD;
"There stood the Page, cool and resolute, and his&#xD;
antagonist stretched out on the carpet.&#xD;
"'What does this mean? inquired the old man, evinc-&#xD;
ing great excitement.&#xD;
"'It means that I have knocked that man, you see&#xD;
lying there, down.'&#xD;
"'And for what cause?'&#xD;
"'Because he would impose on the weak.'&#xD;
"'Upon whom do you mean?'&#xD;
"'Your daughter, 8ir!'&#xD;

"~ Begone from here, instantly !~ replied the 01(1 man;&#xD;

(laughter of the proprietor of the Castle. The- bride&#xD;
was adorned in the costliest silk~ and satinss, and da~-&#xD;
zling jewels. But this was to her an empty pageantry.&#xD;
The maiden felt that she had rather be dressed in ~&#xD;
burial clothes. The liveliest strains of music were dis~&#xD;
coursed; but it was not, to one ~heart, worth anything&#xD;
compared to the tender notes of a harp she had heard&#xD;
&#xD;
in other days,' 0!'. how this pure heart reoolled'~at this&#xD;
empty, heartless festival-as from a crueVmai'tyrdom!&#xD;
"Thou father! sell honor-.-.rcputation----all-..-.but seal&#xD;
not your fate with the deeper damnation of selling' th.&#xD;
matchless wealth of your daughter's heart--c6ndemu~&#xD;
ing her to the companionship of a' man she does not and&#xD;
cannot love!&#xD;
"'But I will not be a victim,' muttered the maiden.&#xD;
'No, let me sleep in the garderi-sweetly sleep-beneath&#xD;
the bending willows, away from the din and treachery&#xD;
of this world; and perchance he may come at evening&#xD;
and weep over my narrow bed!'&#xD;
"There was gt'e'at confusion in the 'Castle. One of&#xD;
the bride's-maids entered her chamber and' found th&amp;amp;&#xD;
maiden lying upon a couch. She thought the bride was&#xD;
asleep, and caught hold of her hand to awaken her. It&#xD;
was icy cold! She shook her, and asked,&#xD;
"'What! asleep qt the bridal hour!' but tli air&#xD;
sleeper moved not. S~he was dead!&#xD;
"A scream startled the crowd beloW, in the hall, and&#xD;
they rushed into the bride's apartment.&#xD;
"In the midst of the alarm and c~nfusiou of this scene,&#xD;
a tall handsome man entered and'forced his way through&#xD;
the crowd to the dead body, and frantically gathered' it&#xD;
in his arms.&#xD;
"In the maiden's hand was a pale, beautiful rose-bud,&#xD;
and a small miniature.&#xD;
"Don Leon stood aghast for a moment, andsudidenly&#xD;
exclaimed:&#xD;
"'The Page! The Page!!'&#xD;
"' ha! ha!' answered the frantic stranger; 'Ha! ha!'&#xD;
and his voice grew husky; 'yes, the Page!'&#xD;

* "Siiiiultaueously every one recoiled back, as if ter-&#xD;
rifled by this fearful tragedy. The lovers were facing&#xD;
each other.&#xD;
~ "The sharp report of a pistol, followed by a stream&#xD;
of blood from Don Leon's breast, sent a thrill of ter-&#xD;
ror through the crowd of spectators. The father fell&#xD;
down upon the floor and cried wildly:&#xD;
"'Retribution! Retribution!'~&#xD;
"Don Leon staggered back, fell and expired.&#xD;
"'Ha! ha! they thought to rob me of my lady love.&#xD;
I see her now!' His eyes was fixed wildly upon the&#xD;
ceiling. 'I a coming, Adelaide!' and, as he spoke,&#xD;
he stabbed himself, and fell, clinging to the cherished&#xD;
~' hziage."&#xD;
"How strange !" exclaimed Madeline; "but, pray,&#xD;
what has this to do with &amp;amp;Iour narrative?"&#xD;
ill tell you. It was to this old Castle we fled&#xD;
afte e occurrence of what I told you last evening.&#xD;
As 1~said, it was reputed to be haunted; and, for this&#xD;
reason, it was ~seldom frequented. The house stiTi re-&#xD;
tained its furniture-the carpets, table, beds, pictures-&#xD;
although they looked old and dusty enough. As we&#xD;
arrived at the Castle, the clouds were just breaking up&#xD;
-floating about in the blue sea above, lik~ so many dark&#xD;
images from the Infernal Pit. Anon, the moon showed&#xD;
her mild face, as she was permitted by the passing&#xD;
clouds. The scene was one I shall never forget. My&#xD;
own peculiar feelings-the awful thought that I was,&#xD;
probably, a murderess-before me spread out the token&#xD;
of a great Presiding Genius of worlds-made an im-&#xD;
pression upon my mind never to be effaced.,&#xD;
"But I must hurry on with my story.&#xD;

"I s~nt my carriage and Mr. Carson back to my resi~&#xD;
dence, while I and my faithful servant, old Juan, re- *&#xD;
gained at the Castle. The arrangement was, that Mr.&#xD;
Carson should secrete himself in a subterranean vault&#xD;
under the mansion. They were to return the n'~&amp;amp;~t&#xD;
night.&#xD;
"The carriage rolled away, and left me standing on&#xD;
the huge marble steps. How I felt my heart sink with-&#xD;
in me, as I saw it disappear. There I stood for some&#xD;
moments' hardly knowing which way to move. Fortu-&#xD;
nately, we had brought with us a lamp and some match-&#xD;
es. I at length walked up the steps into the great high&#xD;
passage, and felt a chill of horror run through me as I&#xD;
entered and heard my foot-steps echo through the great~&#xD;
building.&#xD;
"We wandered about through the different apartments&#xD;
to find the~ best quarters for the night; and I zed cu-&#xD;
riously at the~many mildewed objects I saw. n the&#xD;
walls hung old and unique pictures. Scattered~ ere and&#xD;
there was fine furniture. But, at length, we fonr~d our&#xD;
quarters on the second floor. I threw myself uprni an&#xD;
old couch, overcome with the excitement of the night's&#xD;
adventure.&#xD;

STORY OF A NIGHT IN THE CASTLE.&#xD;

fo~ndax~ apartment in the Castle in which to spend the&#xD;
night decliningg on the couch, I soon fellinto a dreamy&#xD;
sle~p.~ ~ suppose, I had not slept long before I was&#xD;
aro~s~d~by a noise in the passage below. My servant&#xD;
had h1ow~i out the lamp, and was snoring away on the&#xD;
flo~, ~Th~ noise sounded like the dragging of a chain&#xD;
up and down the long passage, accompanied by a groan&#xD;
ind4~gre~t distress. I was terrified. Presently I&#xD;
heard a wild, though very musical voice, in low,. sooth~&#xD;
ing strains, in which the accompaniment of ~ guitar~&#xD;
mingled-all the while the chain noise was kept up.&#xD;
This was continued a great while, until I, at lengthfell&#xD;
asleep, although I ~truggk~d to overcome the drowsiness&#xD;
that came over me.&#xD;
"Again I awoke, and that was my terror to ~beh,~14&#xD;
a young woman, scarcely older than myself, seated by&#xD;
&#xD;
my side, with a candle in her hand, looking intently in&#xD;
my face! At first her eyes gleamed fiercely upon me, and&#xD;
then seemed to inch into tenderness.&#xD;
"'Who are you?' I asked.&#xD;
"'The Prophetess of Fire,' ivan the reply.&#xD;
"'And what has your prophecies to do with fire?'&#xD;
"'It obeys me.'                            /&#xD;
"'How shall I know this?'&#xD;
"'Ha! I can showyon!'&#xD;
"And she put the candle to my clothing, and would&#xD;
have set them on fire if I had not given her a pu~hthat&#xD;
sent her tumbling across the room, putting out the can-&#xD;
dle in the fall. ~It was now perfectly dark; n~y unwel.~&#xD;
come, mysterious visitor arose, with a s~riek, rushed to ~&#xD;
the place where I was lying; but hearing her approach,&#xD;
J scrambled. to another part of the room. I heard her&#xD;
fall over the couch. I hoped that this great UQ ~~ould&#xD;
arouse my servant, but he snored away on the At&#xD;
this4 she set up the most hideous groans I ever heard,&#xD;
while I sat trembling in anothercorner, filled~with terror.&#xD;
At this moment I heard the chain noise, which at Urst&#xD;
alarmed mc, coming u~ the stairs, and then. along the&#xD;
passage that lcd to the room that we were in. I ~heard&#xD;
it near the door, and then the light of a candle' fIa~Iw4&#xD;

me. II felt that I was now doomed. The monster's&#xD;
eyes flashed wildly upon me, and laid roughly hold of&#xD;
my shoulder. I trembled with fright. I knew the de-&#xD;
mon would be deaf to my supplications, as I saw that&#xD;
madness, instead of reason, had possession of him.&#xD;
"'I will brhig my coffin,' said the womar~.&#xD;
"'Goffin P thought I! 'am I to be buried alive, or&#xD;
murdered?'&#xD;
"Here came the woman with the coffin upon her back.&#xD;
Deliberately, she put it down upon the floor, and took&#xD;
the sor~ws out of 'the lid and laid it aside. Inside of&#xD;
the cofflh was some linen, nicely folded, and as white as&#xD;
riven~ snow. it was to be my winding sh~at! It was&#xD;
soon around ~and then they laid me down in the cof-&#xD;
fin--here they stopped for funeral services; and began&#xD;
to ehaunt a most solemn dirge, which the woman accom-&#xD;
panied ~with her guitar. This concluded, they knelt&#xD;
down d the man began a most fervent prayer. I was&#xD;
pr~afrd for as one who had died a natural death. This was&#xD;
noVel, certainly, the hearing of one's own funeral! I&#xD;
imagined that I could almost hear the clods rumbling&#xD;
on ?my coffin.&#xD;
"The vicissitudes of an hour! Who can tell? It is&#xD;
often the work of one short hour to unhinge enterpris-&#xD;
es, overthrow governments, and inaugurate new systems.&#xD;
Human destiny turns upon the small pivot of an instant.&#xD;
A Louis Phillipe of one hour, with the insignia of Roy-&#xD;
ality; may in the next be a trembling fugitive, fleeing&#xD;
from an angry populace; and a Napoleon springs to the&#xD;
throne from obscurity, and for~ the rough chair, has a&#xD;
splendid ~hroie-~-for dusty garret rooms, has the splen-&#xD;
did chambers of a palace! I seemed the creature of&#xD;
&#xD;
quickly varying circumstances, whirled from one event&#xD;
to another.&#xD;
"As this service was going on, I arose softly from~ the&#xD;
coffin, and got out without making any noise, and slip-&#xD;
ped to my servant and shook him. lie sprang up and&#xD;
gazed, aifrighted, at the scene~before him.&#xD;
"'Courage! courage!' I exclaimed; 'out with the&#xD;
fiends.'&#xD;
"In a moment he grappled the man by his long hair&#xD;
and hurledhim, headlong, out into the passage. Quick-&#xD;
ly after him followed the woman, while I closed the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"And they \vere ghosts !" interrupted Madeline.&#xD;
"No; I afterwards learned that t14 woman; who had&#xD;
so grievously tormented me, was a maniac, and that the&#xD;
man, a poor* lunatic, was laboring under the delusion&#xD;
that he was her attendant. I know not wha 2 becomes&#xD;
of the spirits of the dead; yet I feel that i They do&#xD;
linger for awhile about this earth, they are invisible to&#xD;
human ken-that, in a state of spiritual essence, they&#xD;
can no longer be viewed by mortals. As soon expect&#xD;

When w~ have our spiritual sight, we may beh4d what-&#xD;

at a parapet wall, which I soon discovered, to he ~u .in~&#xD;
closure around a burial ground~ We walked on rot~nd&#xD;
the wall until we~ found an entrance. As my eyes~ srn~-&#xD;
veyed that sacred ground, one monument attracted me&#xD;
above the rest-a beautiful marble shaft. , I walked&#xD;
thither; it stood over two graves; and on that pure,&#xD;
white Italian marble was the inscriptionn: 'The LQvers&#xD;
Faithful in Death.' I could not refrain from shedding&#xD;
a tear over the last resting place of those faithful by-&#xD;
ei's. Surely, I thought, their unioxW *n heaven?&#xD;
"By this time I felt greatly exhausted; for I had&#xD;
slept but little, and had taken no nourishment since I&#xD;
left home; but I dreaded to return to that old Castle&#xD;

"No; when asked for her story, she raived, tore her&#xD;

A. OLOoMY, cold evening in th. last days of January,&#xD;
the prairie was covered with deep snow, which was en-&#xD;
oru5tedIwith thin ice. The clouds hung heavy and som-&#xD;
lire, and indicated a bitter, stormy night.&#xD;
White Fawn, an Indian girl, (so-called, on account of&#xD;
her ~'clearwhite skin, and her graceful form,) set out&#xD;
upon a fleet, wild Indian pony across the prairie, in a&#xD;
full :gallop, just as trio broad, red rim of the sun tipped&#xD;
the Western plain of snow, and seemed to be sinking&#xD;
into a sea of molten gold. She rode on, facing the rude,&#xD;
chilling blast, as if upon some mission of 'great impor-&#xD;
tance. In her countenance was a sternness, a heroinism,&#xD;
which evinced a degree of prowess of which your fash-&#xD;
ionable, belles would never think of possessing.&#xD;
White Fawn was the daughter of an Indian chief.&#xD;
She 4was just blooming into woman-hood--au intelligent~&#xD;
beautiful gix'l. You ~uId hardly believe that ske was&#xD;
an Indian. True, her cheeks were slightly bronzed-&#xD;
and very alightly-but her forehead and chin was. per-&#xD;
feet~fair; her face possessed a peculiar attraction; the&#xD;
o~ix~toii~ was ~bold and well ;marked; her eyes fl~st~ drew&#xD;

"C~rtainly! why not?"&#xD;
"I w~s thinkii~g of another affair," was the reply-&#xD;

WhiWFawn, benumbed with ~eold, was wrapped in warm&#xD;

rester~ed her to comfortable~ feeling.&#xD;

knew fro~n the time they ~tarte&amp;amp; from a certain point,&#xD;

LET us relate the story of the captive and Lover of&#xD;

down to the beach on a beautiful ~pring morning, to&#xD;
view the many objects of attraction to be seen along the&#xD;
"sounding shore," he met with a man who seemed to be&#xD;
selecting shells.&#xD;
"What is your name ?" asked the stranger.&#xD;
"Percy Carson, sir," replied the lad, raising ,hi~&#xD;
bright eyes to the questioner's face.&#xD;
The man started back as if an,~ apparition was before&#xD;
him, and then recovering his self-possesion from '~he&#xD;
shook, assumed an air of perfect indifference. Like&#xD;
Lucifer, in the shape of i~ toad, to whisper in the ear of&#xD;
Eve while sIi~ reposed beneath the fragrant bower in the&#xD;
Garden-while the silver 8tars glittered above Par~adise&#xD;
and trembled uponthe four rivers, and the iingel wateh~&#xD;
ers winged through the mystic light-.-this man had as-&#xD;
sumed a shape, a countenance, not his own, and to be-&#xD;
guile, like a lurking demon, an innocent child.&#xD;
"Come, my boy,~' he said in a tone of great kindness&#xD;
"come help me select some pretty shells, and let me&#xD;

how sad it is to see such beating along the dusty path-&#xD;
way: of life, all lonely and dreary-feeling the heart&#xD;
yearn for the music of a soft word and the joy of a&#xD;
kindly glance!&#xD;
The pleasure of this moment nearly repaid our little&#xD;
hero for days nd nights of tears and heart-throbs&#xD;
Mr. Shelley took Percy into an adjoining apartment,&#xD;
and said, as he came to a covered statue: "This, Percy"&#xD;
-and he i~emoved the veil as he spoke-" this is a bust&#xD;
of my wife and your aunt !"&#xD;
The piece of sculpture was exceedingly beautiful, and&#xD;
looked like a thing of life-of beating pulse and breath-&#xD;
ing vitality.&#xD;
They stood for minutes and looked upon the cold mar-&#xD;
ble face-at an image that seemed to transcend earthly&#xD;
loveliness, and the admirers were mute and motionless&#xD;
as statues themselves.&#xD;
"This is the image of my heart," said Mr. Shelley,&#xD;
breaking the profound and s6lemn silence. "It is my&#xD;
good, my blessed angel; that ever hovers around me,&#xD;
whether in the dreams of the still night, when she comes&#xD;
and whispers peace to my troubled spirit, or wending my&#xD;
way along the bustling highway of life-whether brood-&#xD;
ding over ills and misfortunes, or standing before an ap-&#xD;
plauding theatrical audiQnce-whether praised or scan-&#xD;
dalized she is ever with me, exercising a spiritual control&#xD;
over my thoughts and actions~"&#xD;
We will exp1aii~.&#xD;
Mr. Shelley married Aurelia Carson about two years&#xD;
after her brother's flight with Phebe Laniz. The fate&#xD;
of these two fugitive lovers, was, to her, wrapped in&#xD;
mystery-a mystery that was not dissolved to the day&#xD;
&#xD;
'MA D E LUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
69&#xD;
&#xD;
of 'her death. The events which followed their flight&#xD;
were the direct cause of her acquaintance with Mr. 'Shel-&#xD;
ley, and led, 'two years after, to a most felicitous mar-&#xD;
riage. The circumstances were briefly as follows:&#xD;
Aurelia's estate and her brother's were in a state of&#xD;
amalgation. When Don Montie came with the officials&#xD;
to Seize the goods of Mr. Carson for confiscation, Au-&#xD;
relia protested against the appropriation of her 'own es-&#xD;
tate for the so-called offence of her brother.&#xD;
The officers gruffly pushed her aside and tauntingly&#xD;
insinuated that she herself was,, in all probability~ privy&#xD;
to the crime for which her brother had fled, unwhipped&#xD;
of justice, and that a little impertinence might invoke&#xD;
an investigation.&#xD;
Rising proudly, and her eyes flashing with the spirit&#xD;
of true independence, she hurled the false insinuation&#xD;
back in the following words, that evinced a republican&#xD;
heart that could not yield to the gascoriade and over-&#xD;
bearing tyrants. An Americam imbued with the great&#xD;
principles of this glorious land of freedom, can never&#xD;
be overawed by tyranny. The words of Crittenden,*&#xD;
who fell nobly by ignoble hands, illustrate this fact.&#xD;
She said-&#xD;
"It is 'false that my brother fled for the commission&#xD;
of a crime. It is meanly false that I have had any coin-&#xD;
plicity in a conspiracy against the government of this&#xD;

garded by many as a fearless Mid desperate man, and it&#xD;
*was believed that Percy would rue this language.&#xD;

~I~rtip~p! ~ tramp 1. 5~tilJ sounde4, mo~iotonously&#xD;
through the huge building; butt the outward ~storin had&#xD;
passed, ~and the light of the moon glowed ~brightly from&#xD;
pendant water-drops and spreads silvery gauge ~overjake&#xD;
a~id forest,:and turret, a0d tQwer! and peace reigned in&#xD;
8~'lyan bowers and in the walks of the city; where noise&#xD;
and bustle were supreme a few hours before.&#xD;
N&amp;amp;ture was as: calm as a sleeping infant-a holy, sub-&#xD;
lime stillness prevailing, inviting the way~woru chiWren of&#xD;
the earth to repose.&#xD;
But there was no quiet for the troubled spirit of Don&#xD;
Montie-the unrest of a guilty conscience he must cnn-&#xD;
tmue to possess.&#xD;
As well attempt to flee from one's own shadow, as to&#xD;
endeavor to hide from a sense of guilt.&#xD;
Don Montie was walking the floor, when a light rap&#xD;
on the door knob aroused him, and he asked hastily:&#xD;
"Who's there?"&#xD;
"A friend," returned a soft and gentle voice, "please&#xD;
let me in."&#xD;
The door was opened. In stepped the strange woman&#xD;
who so unceremoniously leaped up behind Don M~ontie&#xD;
at the pld cathedral, and rode home with him. She was&#xD;
dropped in a piece of clean, white linen, which served&#xD;
as a sort of gown. or wrapper.&#xD;
Don Montie ~t~ggered back and asked:&#xD;
"What do you Want?"&#xD;
"I will," said the woman, approaching &amp;amp; step ~r 'two,&#xD;
and 'drti~wing herself up sternly, "I will that you shall&#xD;
&#xD;
MID~I~Pr~.                  83&#xD;

As tfie ~bo~ ~rei~iark~ were tittered; ~ b~it 6f~eapons&#xD;
was~&amp;amp;~eie~sly~ bxp&amp;amp;s~d.&#xD;
"C6riscien~e makes cowards of us all!" In his own&#xD;
house, surrdii~ded by a crowd of servants, Don M6i~iie&#xD;
suc6i~ibs to a fe~iiale. He~ is afraid to disobey. 1'he&#xD;
ghostLy ~ftguieis a perfect terror to him. He straight-&#xD;
way commanded the ostler to bring forth hi~ horse.&#xD;
DoiiMontie mounted hi~ horse, and the woman sprang&#xD;
up b~hihd.&#xD;
Firmly seated, the woman slapped the horse with a11&#xD;
her might-.--.using her open palm-and exclaimed:&#xD;
"NoW go!"&#xD;
She held the reins in her own hands and guided the&#xD;
horse.&#xD;
On and on they dashed, not a word was spoken, ~x-&#xD;
cept the frequent exclamation-.-&#xD;
"Faster! faster~&#xD;
Turning from the main road, they plunged into the&#xD;
forest, and finally halted in a thicket of undergrowth.&#xD;
They dismounted, and altering the horse securely to&#xD;
a tree, the woman said:&#xD;
"Ooixie; go with me."&#xD;
Taking Don Montie by the hand, she led him along,&#xD;
sibrhis~i9~iy, as the culprit goes to the gibbet. Pres-&#xD;
ently they came in front of a vaulted cave. ?ei~ha~s&#xD;
nature had done a p&amp;amp;rt of the work, but art h~d evi-&#xD;
dently given its present shape and .dimen~ions. Run-&#xD;
ning into a bhtfl' ~t tht4 foot of 'a hill~w~ a l~ge ~irault,&#xD;
walled up ~nd a~ched overhead with granite. 'A h~avy&#xD;

iron door ~h~sed the entrance~ and it was fastened by a&#xD;
secret spring.&#xD;
A~great while ago---perhaps more than a !entury-&#xD;
thta subterranean vault was to a wealthy Spanish family&#xD;
what t1V.~aepelah was to father Abraham and his descen.&#xD;
dants, a family burial place. The wom~n touched the&#xD;
hidden magic spring, and the door turned upon its&#xD;
things slowly, and with a heavy grating noise, the dark&#xD;
va7ult dungeon was opened before theme&#xD;
Don Montie was commanded to enter, which he did&#xD;
reluctantly, and the woman followed after him,, closing&#xD;
~he door and lighting a small lantern which she had&#xD;
brought with her. After walking some ten paces, they&#xD;
entered a square apartment, which was the end of the&#xD;
vault.&#xD;
The view was at once awful-they were in a charnel&#xD;
house-a~ Golgotha. Human bones lay profusely about,&#xD;
while in the centre there was a heap of bones some two&#xD;
or three feet high.&#xD;
"Now, sir," spoke the woman, as they came to the&#xD;
vault, "I have brought you hither to show you the place&#xD;
where yqur bones will soon be piled. No grave yard&#xD;
shall be your resting place, but here your body shall&#xD;
remain until the day of final accounts. Do you know&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
Don Montie shook his head solemnly in reply to the&#xD;
interrogation.&#xD;
"Ah! you feign forgetfulness of one whom you in-&#xD;
jur~dvietimi~pd-~-robbe.d of her chastity," continued&#xD;
tY1e woman, ~ ~h~er9 WS~ a: f~a4ul ~h~sis ii~ h~er~ex-&#xD;
'kneel; villain, at my feet V&#xD;

&#xD;
M41)ELUTE.                 85&#xD;
"Swear thyself a villain!"&#xD;
"I8Wear!"&#xD;
"You have only lived," said the woman, looking&#xD;
down angrily., at the form kneeling at her feet;~ '~you&#xD;
have only lived to persecute-to blast the happiness of&#xD;
others~-to lurk about and accomplish inischief~-to 'war&#xD;
upon women and children! You are a forger-a mu~-&#xD;
derer-and-and-"&#xD;
The woman paused for a moment, and laughed fran~&#xD;
tically, and then continued-&#xD;
"A 8edu~er! You turned me loose upon the world,&#xD;
covered 4with shame and scorn and misery; blasted-..---&#xD;
robbed of hope-debarred from virtuous society-with&#xD;
no claim for sympathy, while you mingled in the festive&#xD;
throng, and was admitted in society-and all the while&#xD;
you laughed at the credulity of woman. You shall now&#xD;
realize that a woman,, weak though she may be, is yet&#xD;
strong enough and capable of avenging herself. In this&#xD;
place you must remain until I have done what I will&#xD;
with you. Arise, and take your seat upon that pile of&#xD;
bones."               £&#xD;
Don Montie obeyed, and the woman disappeared.&#xD;
There he sat upon that heap of human bones, shut up&#xD;
in a dark vault, with no hope of delivery from the&#xD;
hands of one whom he had deeply wronged years ago-&#xD;
whose life he had made miserable and valueless.&#xD;
Than rob a woman of her chaste reputation-which is&#xD;
a jewel beyond value-'twere better to take away her&#xD;
life.&#xD;
For a long time Don Montie sat reflecting upon his&#xD;
career through life. And as death inevitabiy'~tood 1e-&#xD;
fore him, the mind naturally turned to Eternity!&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7790-00000048"/>&#xD;
M&amp;amp;DELINR.&#xD;
~Eternity! The word seemed to f~Jl free4ngly upon&#xD;
the heart; and the life-current flowed coldly through&#xD;
vein and artery. Awful thought 1 to the man stp~n4ing&#xD;
up~n~ .tjte crumbling brink of hfe and can almost feel the&#xD;
dark c~irre~s of that boundless ocea~n. cutting awq the&#xD;
sand beneath his feet, with not one ray of h~peto ~heer&#xD;
the heart for the voyage upon which it must soon enter!&#xD;
Ite thought first of kneeling and imploring the mercy&#xD;
of the Great Judge; but the thought of the great ex-&#xD;
tent of his guilt, made him feel unworthy to raise his&#xD;
prayerful eyes towards heaven. Musing for a great&#xD;
while, sleep came, as a ministering spirit to the "v&amp;amp;ult-&#xD;
prisoned" sufferer-but there was no repose fQr~ the&#xD;
troubled spirit,&#xD;
A corpse stood before him, with long fingers-a skel-&#xD;
eton face, and deep sunken eyes. It was Mrs. Shelley.&#xD;
The apparition said, waving her right arm in a solemn&#xD;
gesture, and the bones rattled in the joints.&#xD;
"Man! you sent me to the lonely grave, away from&#xD;
the man Iloved!"&#xD;
The dreamer sprang up-the vision had fled-the&#xD;
vault was dark, and the bones beneath him all seemed to&#xD;
stir and send forth a grating sound that made Don&#xD;
Montie's hair rise and his flesh shiver.&#xD;
He sat for a great while, afraid to go to sleep, yet&#xD;
desiring relief or escape from his own thoughts. In&#xD;
spite of resistance, sleep overcame his exhausted nature,&#xD;
and he fell into a slumber. An angel of tho Infernal&#xD;
Pit, poised upon great outspread pinions, having feet&#xD;
and~hands with great ~sharp claws, and fierce burning&#xD;
eye-ball; hovered over him. After a while th~ demo-&#xD;
niacal spirit said-&#xD;
&#xD;
MAI~BLINE.                 8't&#xD;
&#xD;
"We will be companions; when man is deserted both&#xD;
~y his fellow and heaven, we always embrace him in the&#xD;
~ rms of our never failing sympathy." /&#xD;
This time Don Montie sprang to his feet, and his tor-&#xD;
entor.'-4he woman who had brought him into the vault&#xD;
was standing by his side with a lighted candle in her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Oh! wretched life!" he exclaimed, and ho seized&#xD;
the candle and rushed towards the passage that led to&#xD;
the iron door.&#xD;
In a moment the woman wheeled upon him with. a&#xD;
pistol in her haud-.-.flred !---.and Don Montie leaped into&#xD;
the air, yelled and expired!&#xD;

Upon a gathered lily almost withered.&#xD;

my child, in the end. You should not yield so readily&#xD;
to these' trials. It is in vain that you endeavor to con-&#xD;
ceal the promptings of your heart. Those sunken eyes-&#xD;
that hectic cheek, "tell what you would feign conceal.&#xD;
If~he does not love 'you-"&#xD;
"0! hush, Aunt!" said the sick girl to the kind old&#xD;
lady who leaned upon the bed, and as she spoke she&#xD;
covered~ her eyes and wept. "I know this is foolish&#xD;
and childish," continued the girl; "but I can't help it.&#xD;
If you knew all, then you might excuse a part of my&#xD;
weakness; but here are cold words that chill my heart."&#xD;
She read the letter, which ran as follows:&#xD;
"November, 18-.&#xD;
Miss MADELINE LINDSEY: I do not wish to hold you&#xD;
to a disagreeable engagement-and to say the truth,&#xD;
your letters express so little of affection for me that I&#xD;
already feel my own ardor abating. 'Let our engage-&#xD;
ment, ~th~ref9re, end just here.&#xD;
~ truly, &amp;amp;c.,            DOUGLAS hARDY."&#xD;
Th~i~ scene is going on at 'Woodland. Madeline and.&#xD;

{&#xD;
&#xD;
Douglas hardy have been engaged over tw4VemoJith8.&#xD;
He has been in the North-west, 'with his friends, nearly&#xD;
two years.&#xD;
"Well, to my mind, this is singular," began Aunt&#xD;
Phebe, after thoughtfully considering the letter she had&#xD;
just heard read, for a short time. "You have often&#xD;
represented him to me as a brave, sincere man. Now;&#xD;
if this be true, and you have been at no fault in the&#xD;
premises, I cannot conceive what could have led to this,&#xD;
result."&#xD;
"I never realized before how fondly-how profoundly&#xD;
I love him! but it' is all' over now!" remarked the in-&#xD;
valid mournfully.&#xD;
"Let us' hope for the best,' replied Aunt Phebe;&#xD;
"this is, perhaps, only one of those little quarrels that&#xD;
most kvers have, and may not last long.' When 'yo~u&#xD;
get calm and feel well enough, you must sit down and&#xD;
write to him, in a moderate and dignified tone."&#xD;
"I think' I' could do that now,", replied Madeline, if&#xD;
you will have the kindness to supply me with the mate-&#xD;
rial for' writing,' and raise me up in the bed."&#xD;
Aunt Phebe furnished the necessary material-raised&#xD;
her young friend in the bed to a sitting posture, and&#xD;
propped her with'pillows.&#xD;
Madeline began her letter. It ran thus:&#xD;
"December, 18-.&#xD;
Mu. DOUGLAS llAuiY: Your favor reached me this&#xD;

a reply; although I have doubted whether the fore-gone&#xD;

The letter was sealed and dispatched to the office~&#xD;
"~Wi1l flerbert Leslie come this evening?" enquired&#xD;
Aunt Phebe.&#xD;
#'i~e appointedd to come this evening," answered&#xD;
M~delii~e, ~"and to read for me some fugitive poems that&#xD;
he. has collected. I love the ideality of poetry-its&#xD;

tu     she whispers from the dark blue pavilion of&#xD;
night, or gleams forth in the resplendent glory of her&#xD;
stars--" peace on earth and good will to man "-all of&#xD;
these are attributes of poetry. Nothing so touwhingly&#xD;
attests the divine image in man as the ability to create&#xD;
those wonderful images that are everywhere to be found&#xD;
in true poetry.&#xD;
"I do hope Herbert will come and read for me this&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
herbert Leslie was a young gentleman of excellent&#xD;
schol~mhip; rand possessed some attractive qualities;&#xD;
bu4~ he ~was' one of those secretive characters th~t you&#xD;
&#xD;
can never understp~nd. ,There was a. reseh~e, ~&#xD;
ness, about him, and at times he was exeeedi~igly ~gIoomy&#xD;
and taciturn-and even repulsive, except to these to&#xD;
whom he wished to appear agreeable.. He had enpu~h&#xD;
poliC-44ypQ~riSy-&amp;amp;b9ut hi~ to appear a~iakle An~l&#xD;
cheerful, frequently. when his feelings wore tke i~everse.&#xD;
"Ih~te the necessity of this dissimulation," remarked&#xD;
Herbert Leslie to a friend. "I~ut, then, you know,&#xD;
Tom, we must sometimes appear to be what we really&#xD;
are not, or else make ourselves obnoxious in the eyes of&#xD;
the world. I would be detested and shunned in. less&#xD;
time than one fortnight, if I should present myself to&#xD;
the world as I am; for, to tell you the truth, I have no&#xD;
sympathies, in common, with the mixed multitude of&#xD;
society. If I should doff the false show of enjoyment&#xD;
-cease the smiles that are mockeries, my prospects of&#xD;
"a good time coming" would go to nothing. I intend to&#xD;
succeed in my plan, and I know that the world is ~very&#xD;
practical income things, and thus I am induced ~o~nake&#xD;
a heavy sacrifice of feeling to appear affable and £, y&#xD;
to every one, when, in truth, I am a perfect ma*1ut~e P&#xD;
There was very little of "the milk of human kind-&#xD;
ness~' in Herbert Leslie's bosom. It is plain to be seen&#xD;
from his own words as recorded above, that there was a&#xD;
bitterness in his nature towards almost every~ one. He&#xD;
is a narrow, selfish, ovei~bearing man. But' we shall get&#xD;
further index to this mai~i's character by the colloquy&#xD;
which followed:&#xD;
"I say, Herbert!" said Leslie's friend, Tom Martin&#xD;

t~t~1ou8v~ntraction ~f his eye4ids, and' drawing his&#xD;
fa~e full ~ wrinkles. "This 'is punctilious indeed!&#xD;
are getting over-sensitive. IL imagine you' have&#xD;
boon leading a ~Sabbath School tract, or some other&#xD;
pi9us nonsense, and you are now ready to march up to&#xD;
th~ 'CQnfessional.' All things in courtship, as well as&#xD;
in war, are held to be fair-and nothing can be any&#xD;
fairer than the plan that bears off the fair prize. The&#xD;
whole business every body understands to be a system&#xD;
of systematic deception."&#xD;
"No, Herbert Leslie! there is no deception in Made-&#xD;
line Lindsey. If you could win her by this sort of&#xD;
fraud, it would be base and cruel.. Your weapons, cun~&#xD;
ning 'and address, are legitimate only in a contest with&#xD;

as a good husband, an&amp;amp; we will laugh it all over as a&#xD;
clever bit of pleasantry. It will no doubt divert her,&#xD;
that ~Qu' could so successfully counterfeit Douglas Har-&#xD;
dy's handwriting."&#xD;
"By thunder! Herbert never mention my name in&#xD;
connection with this disgraceful affair. No, let the&#xD;
curse $~ Douglas Hardy 'and Madeline Lindsey fall&#xD;
upon the head~ of the one who persists i4~ this 'diabolical&#xD;
sol~e~,'~ a~d iutei~ds to make permanent the results,"&#xD;
replied 'Tom Martin, with warmth. He' continued: "I&#xD;
&#xD;

self unworthy of life and des~tving th&amp;amp; seem ~of 'man-&#xD;
kind, if I should be a party to victimizing a pure, un-&#xD;
suspecting female. The restitution you sugg~st~ will&#xD;
only be adding insolence to an iix'emediable ir4~ury.&#xD;
Thesekare plain word.~, Mr:Leslie, but'they are truthful."&#xD;
"What do you mean, old fellow?" enquired Herbert,&#xD;
affecting a composure he did not feel. He addressed&#xD;
Tom Martin in a conciliatory and patronizing maimer.&#xD;
"It means "-was the jpm~ompt and firm response-&#xD;
"it means that we have both done wrong, and I d~ not&#xD;
intend to go anf further in it."'&#xD;
"Well, then, ihis is no killing matter," said Herbert.&#xD;
"I suppose you will not expose the affair."&#xD;
"No, if it shall end where it is)" was the reply.&#xD;
"So far as you are concerned it shall," responded&#xD;
Herbert.&#xD;
"And, as far as you are concerned it must,'? ans-&#xD;
wQred Torn-" or I will out with the whole 'matter."&#xD;
"Now, I hardly reckon you will make greai to&#xD;
announce yourself as a forger," retorted Herb , as-&#xD;
suming a sort of independent, triumphant air. ~' No&#xD;
one will' thank you, and all will look upon you with&#xD;
conter.ipt."&#xD;
At this, the friends parted, with not the pleasanest&#xD;
feelings from the interview.&#xD;
Tom Martin was one of those urLsuspe~ting men, that&#xD;
may be easily lead astray in an unguarded ix~oment; ~but&#xD;
his heart waS right, and he was always sure to abandon&#xD;
the error into which he had been inveigled, whenft~re~ he&#xD;
had 'time for calm reflection. Herbert had le~d him into&#xD;
the affair, just di~oussed~ a~ a joke, and he exp~edted~ to&#xD;

'MAD~Lx1tE.&#xD;
h~ve~.itrefrble with his dixp~, land to be able to ikiake&#xD;
good use of him; but Tom's better feelings revolted, and&#xD;
no persuasion could recokidile him.&#xD;
He~ert Leslie loved Madeline Lindsey, and he had&#xD;
'faileti upon' the wicked plot of intercepting the letters&#xD;
that ~*ore passir~g between Madeline and Douglas, and&#xD;
of' sending others written in their stead, filled with re-&#xD;
proaches.&#xD;
We shall witness the results.&#xD;
"Herbert is coming, Madeline."&#xD;
~'I am right glad," returnedd Madeline. "Please in-&#xD;
vite him in this apartment."&#xD;
The sick girl raised herself up in t~ie bed to a sitting&#xD;
position, and brushed out the folds from the rich grey&#xD;
robe, which she wore to receive visitors. It was a mag-&#xD;
riificent article of dress, sent her by a friend in Eng-&#xD;
land, intended as a costume for horse-back riding; and&#xD;
to combine both ease and elegance in the studio. It&#xD;
was rich enotigh for a royal robe. It was of silk and&#xD;
s ~ This robe has its associations, to be explained&#xD;
in th~ conclusion of our story.&#xD;
Herbert entered the door with a bland smile. There&#xD;
was something imposing about him whenever he wished&#xD;
to appear ~well; and this evening he intended to make&#xD;
his ~best' effort, as he imagined 'that everything was hi a&#xD;
train to overthrow Douglas Hardy. The only thought&#xD;
thaI~ interrupted him, was the recollection of the 'inter7&#xD;
view with Tern Martin.&#xD;
"Right glad to see you, Mr. Leslie," said Aunt Phebe.&#xD;
~"Y~;"'j 6in~d Madeline-"you will read some poems&#xD;
foji ii~thi~ evening."&#xD;
"Tn~ afraid you only Want the music from the instru-&#xD;

hunioredly.&#xD;
"0, no! that's a little unkind; we love the music,"&#xD;
said Madeline, einplQying Herbert's own allegory.; ~ and&#xD;
we honor the genius of the musician for his §kill~ in&#xD;
bringing it forth from an instrument that is really pos-&#xD;
sessed of no more music than a piece of wood or stone,&#xD;
and we value the man for his genius."&#xD;
"I am glad of my assault on account of the re-&#xD;
joinder," said Herbert pleasantly.&#xD;
"Madeline has not been quite so well this afternoon,&#xD;
notwithstanding her cheerfulness now," interposed Aunt&#xD;
Phebe, "and this flow of spirits is encouraging, truly !"&#xD;
"I understand," observed Herbert. "Not love4ick,&#xD;
I hope, Miss Maddy? If so, poetry is not the medi-&#xD;
cine.* It will only increase the fever and aggravate the&#xD;
malady. We should give you. some sketches of life&#xD;
matrimonial behind the curtain, from every day obser-&#xD;
vation. I think you would mend rapidly wnder the&#xD;
treatment."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Leslie, who should I love? and wh~ could&#xD;
think of loving so homely a girl as I ?" enquired Made-&#xD;
line.&#xD;
"Ti~the first question, I answer, Mr. Douglas Hardy;&#xD;
and to the second, more than will ever find their affec-&#xD;
tions reciprocated."&#xD;
Madeline blushed deeply, and she looked so confused&#xD;
that any one could plainly see that Herbert had named&#xD;
the man.&#xD;
"Well, never mind, he may return after awhile, and&#xD;
then we shall expect the bloom of health to your cheek,"&#xD;
said Herbert, "and you will be as cheerful 'and happy&#xD;

again as a bird at the return of Spring. But I prom.&#xD;
ised to read for you, and must comply."&#xD;
He read several poems to M.adeline, and when~he had&#xD;
finished, sh~ looked o~ieerful; she wads absorbed in poetic&#xD;
dreams, ~and was loath to break the spell, to utter a&#xD;
word; lest the visions should float away.&#xD;
"Now, then, Miss Madeline, I am no Doctor, it is&#xD;
plain," began herbert, after he had concluded the read-&#xD;
ing, "the poetry acts like a charm."&#xD;
"Just what it is!" responded Madeline.&#xD;
Herbert, feeling that he had remained as long as&#xD;
proprietywou14 allow, retired with mingled feelings of&#xD;
se~fpride and self-condemnation. He was proud .to&#xD;
witness the telling effect of his person and manners on&#xD;
the inmates of Woodland. He felt condemned when&#xD;
he reflected how meanly he had acted in the letter busi-&#xD;
ness, but he was not disposed to discontinue his plans.&#xD;
The following conversation at Woodland will show&#xD;
how well Herbert had succeeded in insinuating himself&#xD;
ir~to the esteem of two-thirds of the white family.&#xD;
"I think Herbert is an excellent young man, and&#xD;
possessed of rare qualities. He will finally command&#xD;
the entire respect of our neighbors," said Aunt Phebe.&#xD;
"I agree with you," spoke Madeline, "there is much*&#xD;
promise in him of usefulness and honorable position in&#xD;
community."&#xD;
Herbert's cunning had been taken for sincerity. He&#xD;
has succeeded in deceiving Aunt Phebe and Madeline,&#xD;
and so hid from their view his deformed and forbidding&#xD;
~haraeter, that a graceless, unscrupulous villian is be-&#xD;
lieved to be "excellent," "worthy," &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
There was one of the family, Herbert had not so suc-&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
cessfully hoodwinked. Uncle Ben Carson, who usually&#xD;
looked deeper than the mere surface of things,~ signifi-&#xD;
cantly hinted that all is tiot gold that glitters.&#xD;
"You are suspicious, Undo Ben!" said Madeline to&#xD;
Mr. Carson. "What leads y~u to question Mr. Leslie's&#xD;
sincerity? Is there anything objectionable in his de-&#xD;
portment in society?"&#xD;
"I see the tinsel," began Uncle Ben. "I am not&#xD;
blind to the outward show. Every thing is fair-ever&#xD;
fair. In fact, this leads me to question Leslie's char-&#xD;
acter. He has been in the vicinity but a short time,&#xD;
and he is now on terms of familiarity with almost every&#xD;
,one in the neighborhood. Nothing but outright pre-&#xD;
sumption, to say the least, can prompt a man to seek&#xD;
terms of familiarity with a whole community, when he&#xD;
is conscious that his own past character cannot be&#xD;
known. A meritorious, modest man, has some pride in&#xD;
quietly waiting until his character, qualities and worth&#xD;
are fully known and appreciated. In taking this course,&#xD;
he shows profound respect for society, and observes ~a&#xD;
rule necessary to its protection. Every accomplished&#xD;
villain that happens to be wandering over the country,&#xD;
if he be as forward as Leslie, will walk in to our parlors&#xD;
and becAne familiar with our families-unless a short&#xD;
probation is required upon the part of the community.&#xD;
Society should seek the man. I have been a close ob-&#xD;
server, and I ha~ve learned to be suspicious of forward&#xD;
men."&#xD;
Madeline felt quite vexed at uncle Ben for the re-&#xD;
marks quoted.&#xD;
"For my own part," she replied, "I think Herbert&#xD;
a brave, generous man; and as to his accomplishments&#xD;

*and~ fine taknts, there is no one questions them, I be-&#xD;

"Well, child," said uncle Ben, kindly, "I shall re-&#xD;
joice if it turns out that you are correct in your opin*&#xD;
ion;' and I regret to take a position that may appear&#xD;
unkind to ~yo~tir friend; but. I feel as if you were my own&#xD;
daughter, and that I must act the part of a father to-&#xD;
wards you. I could not, therefore, withhold the views I&#xD;
have just expressed upon a subject of so much manifest&#xD;
Importance, and to show you that I am not alone in the&#xD;
ffosition I have taken, here is a note I received yester-&#xD;
day. It runs thus:&#xD;
'Mu. CARSON-DEAR Sin: It is in your power to&#xD;
do great good, by preventing certain mischievous and&#xD;
wicked schemes intended to victimize a lady friend of&#xD;
yours. You do not dream- ~nor does she-of what has&#xD;
already been accomplished. Leslie is a monster; and&#xD;
events will proVe it. I only fear that they will come&#xD;
out too late.&#xD;
Yours,&#xD;
Persecution never drives a true-hearted woman from&#xD;
a man. She is our first, last and best friend. Slander,&#xD;
scandal and vituperation only makes her cling more fond-&#xD;
ly to man. Her sympathy "droppeth as the gentle dews&#xD;
from Heaven" upon the wounded and disconsolate spir-&#xD;
it, ~nd in her tears gleam 'out the bright stars' of Para-&#xD;
* dise, mirroring Joy arid Hope-a purity as sublime as&#xD;
the- gentle breezes of childhood. ' If in her too cozifid-&#xD;
ing ~nature she lost us Eden, and 'brought 'down the aw-&#xD;
fur'wrath 'of the Almighty, she annointed th~. head ~of&#xD;
* Jesus-lingered at the Cross, and was first at' the i~oly&#xD;
&#xD;
MADELIITE.                  99&#xD;
Sepi4ch~. to behQld the arisen Savior, and proclaim the&#xD;
glad tidings that the Lion of the Tribe of Judea, had&#xD;
triumphed over the monster, Death.&#xD;
When Madeline read the note, she quickly replied-.&#xD;
"There ~8 r~o signature attached, and J suppose no&#xD;
one. responsible. Herbert must fall a victim to the&#xD;
madduations of a secret foe."&#xD;
"I ~tm furnished with a responsible name on another&#xD;
slip," answered uncle Ben.&#xD;
"If the writer anticipates anything like a matrimonial&#xD;
allh~nce between Mr. Leslie and myself, he will be dis-&#xD;
appointed. I only speak of him as an acquaintance.&#xD;
The only relation we can ever sustain towards each&#xD;
other."&#xD;
"I admire your devotion to a friend-it is creditable&#xD;
to you, and I have only to hope he will prove himself&#xD;
worthy~ of it," remarked uncle Ben.&#xD;
Uncle Ben knew nothing~ of the remarkable letter&#xD;
Madeline had received from Douglas Hardy-that their&#xD;
engagement was now broken-and as he rubbed his large,&#xD;
graceful hand over the sick girl's forehead, he said, jok-&#xD;
ingly, with a smile-&#xD;
"Never mind, Miss Maddy, I will let Douglas know&#xD;
that you have a new friend here, who may possibly grow&#xD;
into a formidable rival."&#xD;
"Oh I uncle Ben, you do not know Douglas has thrown&#xD;
my love away. He has gone out into the world, and is&#xD;
now ashamed of so.. simple a creature as I for his in-&#xD;
tended. So gifted, and brilliant, and with such a future&#xD;
of fame and fortune before him, it is not strange that he&#xD;
should seek in the Court of this world's fashion a more&#xD;
famous and worthy alliance."&#xD;

"Ha! this is news, to be sure," replied Mi~. Car-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
A suspi~ion at once flashed through hi~ mind. ~Phis&#xD;
sentence of the note he had received, came to mei~ory-&#xD;
"You do not dream, nor does she (Madeline) of that&#xD;
as already been accomplished!"&#xD;
"There is a trick in it!" exclaimed uncle Ben, una-&#xD;
e ~o ~withhold the conviction that rested upon his mind.&#xD;
He read the sentence of the note to Madeline and&#xD;
continued~~-&#xD;
"II affirm that IL do solemnly believe that Herbert&#xD;
Leslie has had some hand in bringing about this result."&#xD;
For several minutes Madeline lay pensive, and then&#xD;
arousing herself, said-&#xD;
"Oh! no, he is innocent. In the midst of my dis-&#xD;
tress he came and sympathized with me, and his gentle&#xD;
words fell upon my heart like dew-drops on the droop-&#xD;
ing flower. No, I will not dim or sully the faithful mir-&#xD;
ror of friendship by the hot and vapory breath of sus-&#xD;
picion. But I feel, alas! that-&#xD;
'My days are in the yellow leaf,&#xD;
The flower and fruits of love are gone,&#xD;
The worm, the canker~ and the grief,&#xD;
Are mine alone.&#xD;
'The fire that in my bosom preys,&#xD;
Is like to some volcanic Isle,&#xD;
No torch is kindled at its blaze,&#xD;
A funeral pile.&#xD;
'The hope, the fear, the jealous care,&#xD;
Th' exalted portion of the pain&#xD;
And power of love, I cannot share,&#xD;
But wear the chain."'&#xD;
&#xD;
When. Madeline had finished quoting thQ above lines,&#xD;
tears gathered fast in her eyes, and fell rapidly' down&#xD;
her pale cheek. Uncle Ben, whose heart was almost as&#xD;
tender as a child's, was touched with sympathy, and&#xD;
turned sside to hide the flood that was swelling in his&#xD;
own eyes.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE CONFESSION.&#xD;
'WHAT'S the news?"&#xD;
"The Doctor says she's worse."&#xD;
"Not dangerous, eh?"&#xD;
"Yes, Herbert, very dangerous."&#xD;
The above colloquy occurred between Herbert Leslie&#xD;
and a young friend.&#xD;
"It is whispered," began the latter, "that Douglas&#xD;
Hardy has deceived her, and that she is taking' it to&#xD;
heart. I cannot believe that Douglas is capable of 'such&#xD;
a thing, for I am confident that he is ~s true 'a man as&#xD;
ever walked the earth. That he did love Madeline&#xD;
Lind8ey, I. have not a single doubt. I will write to him&#xD;
this evening."&#xD;
Herbert turned pale as these words were uttered.&#xD;
"What's' the matter, Herbert? Are you sick? You&#xD;
are deathly pale !"&#xD;
"I am subject to momentary fainting spells, but they&#xD;
are~ only momentary."&#xD;
Herbert felt condemned. At that moment he would&#xD;
have yielded his scheme; no matter what the prospect of&#xD;
success, if it would repair the mischief now resulting&#xD;
from it. Like his alleged "fainting spells," those feel-&#xD;
ings were only momentary. The citadel 'of his heart&#xD;
was too well guarded by evil passions-sleepless senti-&#xD;
&#xD;
nels-to allow any good resolve to remain long ~it'hin&#xD;
their dominion. It was the sudden shock of threatened&#xD;
consequences o~ a melancholy nature that had discon-&#xD;
certed him. But he was not long in regaining his&#xD;
former self-possession, and his purpose was as fixed -and&#xD;
determined as ever, though the very pavements of the&#xD;
earth should tremble beneath his tread.&#xD;
"I think I will call this evening and see Miss Made-&#xD;
line," said Herbert. "Perhaps the affair is not so se~,&#xD;
rious after all, as we have been lead to believe."&#xD;
Herbert called late in the afternoon.&#xD;
When he entered the room, by invitation, Madeline&#xD;
was supported by some pillows, in a half-reclining posi-&#xD;
tion, looking through the window at the setting sun, and&#xD;
the soft rays lingered upon her faded cheek, and cast a&#xD;
delicately beautiful, but melancholy, glow over her face.&#xD;
"Are you better?" tenderly asked Herbert.&#xD;
"I do not know, Mr. Leslie," answered Madeline.&#xD;
".1 was just thinking," she continued, "that I should&#xD;
not mind to die if I could sink to rest as quietly as yon-&#xD;
der sun glides away in its beautiful vermillion shroud.&#xD;
I love to look upon the serene face of nature,' and im-&#xD;
agine that I can see God smiling with goodness, mercy&#xD;
and love; and that I can see bright angels standing&#xD;
upon the craggy points of the snow-white little clouds&#xD;
that float dreamily in the blue sea: that I can see harps&#xD;
in their hands, and diadems upon their brows. Yes, I&#xD;
love nature. There is no dissimulation in the works of&#xD;
our Father. There is no deceit 'graven upon Jehovah's&#xD;
heart.'"&#xD;
Herbert's head dropped updn his bosom. These&#xD;
words found their way to his heart.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
"PRETTY NANNIE," OF CLIFTON VALE.&#xD;
EMBOWERED in the thick forest of Clifton Vale, was&#xD;
au elegant mansion, a massive granite gothic building,&#xD;
surrounded with lawns, and walks covered with shells&#xD;
and white pebbles, and gardens, and~parks, and green&#xD;
meadows.' In front of the balcony, extending the full&#xD;
length of the building, with large, tall pillars, that sug-&#xD;
gested to the mind a union of wisdom, strength and beau-&#xD;
ty, there was 'a marble shaft, about ten feet high, stand-&#xD;
ing by a large basin of the same material. From this&#xD;
column, or shaft, a beautiful fountain gushed, and fell&#xD;
sparkling into the basin below. Everything had~ the air&#xD;
of comfort and neatness.&#xD;
The chain of hills that circled around in the dim and&#xD;
shadowy distance towering up the welkin, as if the blue&#xD;
dome .rested upon the peaks "as eternal columns that&#xD;
end 'in the starry vault and prop the spheres' '-that&#xD;
mighty chain encircled Clifton Vale, and shut out all&#xD;
vieW of the world.&#xD;
Late one evening, just as the grey twilight began to&#xD;
shut in, and the light of the moon tinged the tops of&#xD;
the trees, and glanced through leafy woods, in silvery&#xD;
lines, and' pictured. upon the earth strange figures and&#xD;
hierQglyphics, while dewy lawn and meadow sparkled as&#xD;
if countless gems hung upon the bending grass-a weary&#xD;

fr~m this meeting, "like Minerva from tha brain of Ju-&#xD;

siour of~ admiration upon the young maWs face, when he&#xD;
shQQk the hand~ of Nannie, and he entertained not a&#xD;
single 4qub~ of his; preference for her.&#xD;
Wool~ey had cherished a secret prejudice against- the&#xD;
J~eighton orphans, and all because they elicited more at-&#xD;
tention from the public than his own children.~ How;re-&#xD;
volting~ that;a ma~ should have prejudice. against an in~&#xD;
nocent, fatherless child I How terrible must be the&#xD;
curse that awaits such a being. Alone in the world-&#xD;
untaught-in the- great business of life-.with no great&#xD;
throbbing heart of sympathy to lean" upon when fever&#xD;
racks the' brain and gives hot eye-balls! Vile man!&#xD;
to feel no kindly impulse for the orphan in your charge!&#xD;
Woolsey-was:unkind to these orphans. That was not&#xD;
all, he- was cruel to them. It is written against him in&#xD;
the Great Book which St. John saw.&#xD;
The guardianship of the Leighton orphans placed a&#xD;
large sum of money into his hands, and this h~ u~ed to&#xD;
edueate~ his own children. Poor orphans! they must&#xD;
stay at home and do drudgery, while the -Woolsey ehil~&#xD;
dren were ~abroad, rioting with their money.&#xD;
Nannie submitted as best she could, on her mother's&#xD;
account. - Mrs. Woolsey bought Nannie- a neat silk&#xD;
dress, but Woolsey affirmed she should not wear -it.&#xD;
She neVer mufrniired when the silk was folded and laud&#xD;
aw~y.&#xD;
I' blame you,~ mother.' Thy trials have been- great,&#xD;
and I ~would' not add another~ pang to thy sufferings-&#xD;

These words, so soft and gentle, aroused him, and he&#xD;
looked up. An Italian flower girl, plainly., but neatly&#xD;
clad, with a willow basket, swinging on her arm, filled&#xD;
with ~the Flora~r collection, stood before him upon the&#xD;
outer edge of the pavement. The little merchantess&#xD;
was ~about fourteen years of age, of brunette complexion&#xD;

"ll~yQt1 buy flowers?" said tho little Italian.&#xD;

"Th~it this is more than all my flowers are worth."&#xD;
Very well-this little boluet will do."&#xD;
The man walked away, absorbed ag~~n'in the deep&#xD;

Day after day he tarried in the city, and met'the&#xD;
yiiglial~an girl, and as regularly her heart was ~iad~&#xD;

"Is that you, Gabriclla?" answered a tall and slender&#xD;
woman, advanced in years, but possessing ~a smith&#xD;
pleasant face, and a lively, quick eye. This' woman&#xD;
had evidently seen better days than these.&#xD;
"I am glad you have come so soon! Your presence&#xD;

was so anxious, before we left Germany, to take you as&#xD;
his protege, but I felt, my child, as I now feel, that I&#xD;
could riot live 'without you."&#xD;
The daughter threw her arms around her mother's&#xD;
neck, an~1 imprinted a warm kiss upon the matron's&#xD;
cheek, and they mingled their tears.&#xD;
"I am glad ~you did not give me away, mother, for I&#xD;

ess it is not improbable that I may get the story~. if not&#xD;

Thus Madeline ruminated, and listened earnestly for&#xD;
a continuation of the dialogue.&#xD;
"Did ypu know J~iridsey?" asked Maci&#xD;
was the reply.&#xD;
"And is he not dead according to report?"&#xD;
"He may be for all I know 'bout it !"&#xD;
"Then, you don't know that she hasa father livhi~?"&#xD;
"Idon'they? Reckon Idon't!"&#xD;
"Then, how is it? You speak strangely."&#xD;
"As Shakspeare says ~' thar's where it grinds."'&#xD;
"I suppose yciu mean to say 'there's the rub."'&#xD;
"Imean to say that Jack Long knows what he'&amp;amp;bout.&#xD;
That's all, Mac, ye understand 1" and- as the last sen~&#xD;
tence was drawn out with a long breath, Jack gave his&#xD;
comrade a significant wink.&#xD;
"Well, this is a mystery sure enough. I am really&#xD;
puzzled by these assertions-...assertions I must call them,&#xD;
for I cannot deem them revelations. Albeit one cannot&#xD;
help feeling perplexed at suggestions like these. I haiye&#xD;
no thought that my birth is clouded, it cannot b~ I"&#xD;
As these reflections passed through Madeline's m1~d,&#xD;
she sat down upon a heap-of st-ones that h~y-againsttthe&#xD;
i~all of the cave, absorbedin a deep reverie, and ~Sn~ow&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIHI.&#xD;
A D VE NT URtES I N T HE C A VE.-&#xD;
&#xD;
MAD$iMNE was-an underground' prisoner, with Snow&#xD;
Ball, her only companion, and without anything to' sub-&#xD;
sist upon. This was a gloomy~ imprisonment, add the&#xD;
hope of relief 'lay entirely in making herself known to&#xD;
the robberaband. At this humiliation cher 'feelings and&#xD;
pride rebelled~-~and besides, Herbert Leslie was a mem-&#xD;
ber of thie clan. She 'could hope for no mercy at 'his&#xD;
hands, edi she trembled as she thought that even he&#xD;
might be the first to find her out in. her dismal hiding&#xD;
eAfter using a great while, she ventured out again&#xD;
intodthe main open channel, with a view of finding but,&#xD;
if spassible, what part of the cave the :robbers ccui-&#xD;
pied '&#xD;
She again leached the; curve, and then the rotunda,&#xD;
followodgelosely by Snow Ball.&#xD;
A sunalkbeaten path through the largest arch that led&#xD;
from the rotunda pointed the way to the 'den of high.-&#xD;
waymen.&#xD;
Timidly, she passed through the arch, which looked&#xD;
like a piece of artistic workmanship, rather than the&#xD;
work sof nature. There was on each side, a heavy, round&#xD;
coluilan; upon a very close examination of it, however,&#xD;
their natural formation was perfectly clear. These beau-&#xD;

tiful pillars were formed by the slow, but continuous&#xD;
dripping of water for ages, in which were carried sand&#xD;
and pebbles and lime-stones, which became cemented and&#xD;
hardened. The arch that rested upon those pillars saas&#xD;
probably formed in nearly the-same manner. In the&#xD;
last instance the water did not fall iin -drops, but ran&#xD;
down on both sides of the surface above, with the com-&#xD;
bination of material, and deposited, of course, when -the&#xD;
pillars themselves, had reached the curve .or beginning&#xD;
of the arch. Before the pillars were formed, these 'little&#xD;
drops that found their way down the curve above, fell&#xD;
upon the forming column, and thus nature went on, har-&#xD;
moniously, noiselessly, and sublimely in her work.&#xD;
She ventured forward into the dark corridor, and it&#xD;
seemed that her heart beat so loudly that it would be&#xD;
heard and lead to her discovery. Feeling her way, and&#xD;
groping along, she entered a narrow defile, leading in&#xD;
Northern direction, through a fissure in the cavern, which&#xD;
would barely admit the size of Snow Ball. It seemed&#xD;
darker still. The few wandering rays of light that crept&#xD;
faintly through the rotunda into the arch she first ene&#xD;
tered, did not penetrate this primeval darkness;-but this&#xD;
only intimidated, for the moment-did not drives her&#xD;
back; and safety being the desideratum.-here Made-&#xD;
line-ensconsed herself behind a large fragment off rock,&#xD;
which fate seemed to design for the very purpose. -The&#xD;
broken rock stood upright, and was all covered with moss&#xD;
upon the South side, whilst upon the Northern extrem-&#xD;
ity, there fell a little stream, whose rippling and splash-&#xD;
ing was the only pleasant noise that broke upon the Si-&#xD;
lence of the eave. This was interrupted by a serpentine his&#xD;
or the ceroaking of frogs. The pelting of this little-streama&#xD;

thai she and Snow Ball could enter the cylinder, but it&#xD;
w~ ~narrow work.' In a: low muimur ~he seemed to coin-&#xD;
mnnicate to' her pony the necessity of profound silcn7ce.&#xD;
Snow Ball, with quivering ears, and frontal' and 'nostril&#xD;
rai~d high-and Madeline reQlining against the rock&#xD;
with .folded~ arms-the npble steed and his brave mistress&#xD;
awaited the coming of the robber band in painful ens-&#xD;
peiise. But it was not long that they had to wait. The&#xD;
tratnpini~ of feet in ~he corridor fell distinctly upon Mad~&#xD;
ell.d d's ear, and the rumbling sound seemed to roll jar-&#xD;
ringly down the dark labrynth, until it found a great&#xD;
i'e~ervoir below-a bottomless abyss. At this moment&#xD;
o~i4of the band entered the aperture leading directly to&#xD;
tTiV place where our 'trembling little victim sat.' Fortii-&#xD;
n~.tely, the foremost one rode a very large horse; as Mad-&#xD;
eline~ could tell from the fact that he could hot pass the&#xD;
entrance. Still he' persisted and' was- half way through,&#xD;
when fragment of rock struck him in the sid~, which&#xD;
g~e hii~ al~m, ~nd he sprang forward with a' treinen-&#xD;
dou~ ~exerti6n, that sho7pk the very rocks-atid plunging&#xD;
froM side to 'side,' fell, at length, into the awful abyss.&#xD;
It w~s frightful to hear the wild 'neigh of the steed,&#xD;
min~Thd with the deep groans of the rider which came&#xD;
up froni the chasm, and go echoing solemnly through the&#xD;

away to the, east, crossing the passage, near the p.1&amp;amp;ce&#xD;
in which sh~ had tt~ken refuge. That ray~Qf lig4t was,&#xD;
the answer of prayer!&#xD;
$he followed her heavenly guide-tAke ray of light&#xD;
with trembling step-she passed cautiously a1or-.a~s-&#xD;
cenaing. some fifty. feet-for the passage through which&#xD;
the ray of light came gradually ascended-.--.the Opening&#xD;
became more capacious. At this moment, strange,&#xD;
sweet music came stealing along down those dark sub-&#xD;
terranean aisles! and rose and swelled, until the very&#xD;
air seemed full of melody.&#xD;
"What can this mean? Are these earthly sounds?&#xD;
Or is it a bancpiet of enchanters and fairies~ Methink&#xD;
these notes are as sweet as those of the syren! that litr~,&#xD;
even the wary mariner upon fatal rocks. Surely, if&#xD;
tl~iere be sweet music here, in this dark Tartarean place,&#xD;
it mast exist everywhere."&#xD;
While these reflections were passing through Made-&#xD;
line's mind, she stepped suddenly and unexpectedlyinto&#xD;
aJarge apartment that was filled with a dim grey light,&#xD;
a sort of twilight, in which you could discern distinctly&#xD;
every object in the apartment. It was a complete J~all,&#xD;
with a high dome, with a chandelier suspended by a long&#xD;
iron Qhain and great collossal pillars, standing, .he~ and&#xD;
there, with beautiful carvings. It evidently had~, ho&amp;amp;n,&#xD;
or was now, Qecupied, or frequented by human. beings,&#xD;

pr~sm&amp;amp;tic colors. A moment more, and the spell was&#xD;
br~ken~! A rustling near by aroused Madeline from&#xD;
her dreamy* contemplation to behold a female standing a&#xD;
few~. paces in front, of her. The lady gazed first at&#xD;
M~ade1ine, and then at Snow Ball, who stood tamely by&#xD;
her mistress.&#xD;
"Who are you?" required the lady, after several&#xD;
+ ~ients of silence.&#xD;
'I am, as you see, a woman, who has had the mis-&#xD;
fQrtune to wander into this c~ve, and am now endeav-&#xD;
oring to escape from it and the clutches of the wicked&#xD;
* men who infest it," answered our heroine.&#xD;
'~And~ uow, may I be so bold as to repeat your own&#xD;
questi~rn-'who are you?' "-she continued.&#xD;
"4~n~iserable woman, duped, betrayed and ruined by&#xD;
a ~ma~n who mingles in the nightly ogeries that are held&#xD;
kelow,' "w~s. the immediate reply of the hermitess, who,&#xD;
as~ she spoke, t~irned her face up to the light, and wiped&#xD;
her eyes in which tears were gathering.&#xD;
4Plie light revealed a beautiful, earnest countenance.&#xD;
4We pass the interview. The imprisoned beattty had&#xD;

dishonored, she sought not to leave its gloomy confines.&#xD;

"Ah! well, there are other routes, but I do not k~A~W&#xD;
them."                               .   '&#xD;
Madeline turned to retrace her steps, with a h~v~y&#xD;
heart. Down the dark way she groped along, with her&#xD;
hand upon Snow Ball's foretop, until, at length, she&#xD;
found herself again at the shelving rock where. she had&#xD;
taken refug~ from the robbers. Remembering that*&#xD;
there was a great abyss near her, she stopped a moment&#xD;
for reflection. A 'hoarse growl aroused her, and she&#xD;
turned aroi~nd and beheld, by the dim ray of light, a&#xD;
huge monster only a few paces from the place where.~&#xD;
she stood. Snow Ball raised her head, and with a W&#xD;
snort, sprang between her mistress and the monster.&#xD;
heroine no~v discovered that the animal, a large. gri~'zly&#xD;
bear,'was standing on the edge of a cavern--the one&#xD;
in which the robber had fallen-and was probably&#xD;
startled from his deep cavernous den by the fall of the&#xD;
robber-his groans and the wild neigh of his horse.&#xD;
The bear reared upon his hinder-legs, looked alternately&#xD;
at Snow Ball, who maintained a firm, war-like p'ositi~xi,&#xD;
and Madeline, i~emembering that aunt Phebe had~cha~g~ed&#xD;
her not to go abroad without some means of defence,&#xD;
placed her hand upon' the pistol, and' awaited the&#xD;
threatened onslaught. The bear seemed to prefer M~d-&#xD;
eline for his victim, and crouched himself for' a ~bbld&#xD;
leap, but Snow Ball whirled in an instant, and 'with~her&#xD;
heels sent the grizidy antagonist trembling down pinto&#xD;

that you were lost. My apprehensions were increased&#xD;
when I discovered that you had gone into the cave, and&#xD;
I could see no signs of your return. I took my stand here,&#xD;
determined to remain for a great while in the hope of&#xD;
finding out something which might throw light possibly&#xD;
upon your fate. I saw two robbers yesterday, and I&#xD;
gathered by accident from their allusions to Herbert&#xD;
Leslie's villainy towards yourself that if you were in the&#xD;
cave you had not yet been discoverca, and I took en-&#xD;
couragem~nt to remain. 'While they were yet in the&#xD;

a large quantity of wine, and lay down upon. my bed,&#xD;

found a note, neatly folded, lying upon my. breast.&#xD;
Eagerly I opened it, and read this sentence:&#xD;
"Be not a1arx~ed for White Fawn, you may see her&#xD;
soon."&#xD;
"There was no signature to it, and I doubted its re~~&#xD;
liability. It occurred to me that some friend feariiig&#xD;
that bad results might come of my peculiar distress ljad~&#xD;
fallen upon this piece of deception to gradually prepare&#xD;
my mind. I read the note again and discovered that it&#xD;
was the handwriting of a female. This gave me more&#xD;
confidence in the reliability of the note, for I have no&#xD;
female friends or even passing acquaintances in this vi-&#xD;
cinity, and the news could not have spread. Further-&#xD;
more, it then occurred to me that the facts co~ild i~ot be&#xD;
known to any one in this reghn, without the apprehen-&#xD;
sions expressed in the letter were true and she was ac-&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
TRIALS OF AN ORPHAN.&#xD;
"~F~! fle!" exclaixxi~ed Albinus Lindsey, as he paced&#xD;
A'~Yot~ xuust be patient," said jDouglas Hardy.&#xD;
'I could be patient if it did not seem that even the&#xD;

Thuis spoke, Albinus, exhibiting a degree pf irritation&#xD;
unusual for him.&#xD;
"J3ut all your chafing wil4 not hurry the carriage-&#xD;

"Neber saw de cliii' in such a figity afore!" said un-&#xD;
cle Tom, to himself.&#xD;
The party consisted of Albinus Lindsey,~ Douglas&#xD;
Hardy and Percy Carson.~ They threw their heavy&#xD;
cloaks over their shoulders and walked out to the chaise&#xD;
that was standing in waiting for them at the gate.&#xD;
It was now near nightfall, and the black clouds lay&#xD;
piled up, mountain high, and vivid liglitnings shot&#xD;
downward across the sable bosom of the coming storm,&#xD;
as Lucifer fell from the crystalline battlements of heaven,&#xD;
down through darkness, to the sulphurous regions 9f&#xD;
hell.&#xD;
This is certainly an unpromising night for an adven-&#xD;
ture, ft must be a mission of some importance that&#xD;
induces them abroad, while nature seems so unpropi-&#xD;
tious.&#xD;
In the carriage-the curtains drawn closely down-&#xD;
the coachman sitting, twirling his whip several times&#xD;
over his head, with manifest pride, as if there. was great&#xD;
art in cracking a whip-and there is for aught I know&#xD;
to the contrary-the chaise was soon rattling down the&#xD;
road-bou~nd for the vicinity of R&#xD;
Leaving our friends to the perils of a dark, stormy&#xD;
night, with twenty-five miles to travel, over a bad road&#xD;
-a ride withal in which we are glad to have no part-&#xD;
we will relate some occurrences that transpired a short&#xD;
time before the circumstances just mentioned.&#xD;
John Leighton, a cousin of Nannie Leighton, ~o~-&#xD;
sessed considerable wealth, and was a gentleman of lib-&#xD;
eral feelings, and a generous~ sympathy for the op.~&#xD;
pressed. He had heard, with great regret and dis~&#xD;

p~asu~e, of the unkindness of Wolsey to his orphan&#xD;
co~s~ns, a~l of his expenditure of their property. He&#xD;
sel~* 1{anni~ an invitation to visit him, and~p~nd' a mohth&#xD;
or two with his family. Another cousin of th~ Leigh-&#xD;
ton ~rph'an~, J~nies Denman, happening in the neigh.~&#xD;
borh~4 'obout this time, proposed to take KN"annie home&#xD;
wit~i him; and after she had spent sometime at his&#xD;
house, to send her to Mr. Lekighton~s. Denman, wish-&#xD;
'ing t~ b~ i~espectful, asked Wolsey's conseiit to the ar-&#xD;
z'ai~gement. It was given with seeming cheerfulness,&#xD;
but iii j~is heart he objected. He "wished to appear kind&#xD;
to these orphans in the presence of their relatives, and&#xD;
to huve denied Nannie this privilege would have been&#xD;
an acknowledgement of an unkind disposition ~towards&#xD;
"She is welcome to go, and to stay as long as she&#xD;
may. desire!"&#xD;
Thus spoke Wolsey; but 'IDenman had scarcely passed&#xD;
the outer 'door with Nannie, who ~nade haste in getting&#xD;
Te~dy, ere a tirad~ of abuse was opened upon Mrs.&#xD;
Wol~&amp;amp;y-~--who usually came in for a 'large share upon&#xD;
every occasion ~of Wolsey's displeasure towards the or-&#xD;
phans in hi~ charge.&#xD;
Bad~'inen are' usually hypocrites, and like Proteus, a&#xD;
sea~g9~ Oan assume any shape 'they please.&#xD;
"I' hav~ had never a' wdrd to say in this matter.--yQu&#xD;
gave your owti'oonsent," 8aid Mrs. Wolsey.&#xD;
"Po~'~apa. not!" retorted Wolsey, bitterly.&#xD;
~ pure-~pirited orphan! Fly from the hate-&#xD;
ful pre~h~9ts of, the plane, where thou has not a single&#xD;
prot~p~oi~.iio1~even in that mother who gave thee~exi~t-&#xD;
ence, but dare not defend her own offspring. Would&#xD;
&#xD;
163&#xD;
&#xD;
that I could give thee speed of swift-iVing~d Mbrdi~i'y,&#xD;
or of Uriel,' in' his transit 6n a ~u~be~m. ~o ! Jet p~fre&#xD;
frbsh air~bathe thy throbbing temples, and ~ive~ easet to&#xD;
thy aching heart. Youth, beauty, ho~ei and heal1~h are&#xD;
thine.&#xD;
It is due that the wife should yield to the ~hu~bain&amp;amp; to.&#xD;
a reasonable extent, and under some circumstances bven&#xD;
beyond-~but' the mother shouldnev~r be less true to'h~r&#xD;
offspring than the tigress is in defence of' her young.&#xD;
Our orphan girl spent a fortnight with her coUsin&#xD;
Denma~, 'whose' heart was too true and gallant to be&#xD;
other than kind to his' fair relative and visitor.&#xD;
She then went to 'see Mr. Leighton, who conversed&#xD;
with her often, with a view of ascertainiPg the extent&#xD;
of Wolsey's 'unkindness to hei'. She always, however,&#xD;
in' her calm and unexcitable manner, avoided the recital.&#xD;
"Would you like to go back? or would you prefer to&#xD;
remain with us? If you choose to remain with us, I&#xD;
will pay the expenses of your education, including, of&#xD;
course, your board, and the supply of your wa#drob~."&#xD;
These words were uttered by John' Leighton, in thegen..&#xD;
erosity of his heart.&#xD;
This sal)y placed Nannie in a position where she felt&#xD;
bound, from gratitude, to express herself fully-t6 ut-&#xD;
ter what she had intended to keep shut u~p in kei' own&#xD;
bosom.' She said:&#xD;
"I do not desir~ to return to Mr. Wolsey's. lle:has&#xD;
treated myself 'and my brothers and sisters uimkindly&#xD;
and 'unjustly.' Thi~ a r'evelati~n I 'di4 'jiot i~it~nd 'to~&#xD;

Johi~LeigJaton ~rose fram hi~ chair, almost uncon~-&#xD;

* A cloud seemed to pass through her' mind. She&#xD;
looked sad shook ~her head ominously.&#xD;
She kn&amp;amp;w that if Wolsey determined to bring her&#xD;
back to hi8 hoii~e he would in all probability adopt this&#xD;
ruse ~te se~~ure h~r return and to obscure his 'town bad,'&#xD;
overbearingdisposkion. He could allege that it; ;was&#xD;

"And do' you apprehend that your mother coul4 be&#xD;

who readily perceived that some unpleasant misgiving&#xD;
was passing through her mind. "If so, then I ~ht~ll&#xD;

most fiercely, and hesitating for a 'moment, he cox~tin~'&#xD;
ed-&#xD;
"If you refuse to go,. I defy Wolsey or any one else,&#xD;
to attempt force, and it shall be a dear piece of busi-&#xD;
ness. 'Let him resort to the courts to recover you as&#xD;
his ward, if he wishes."&#xD;
"He is afraid that-" began Nannie, and a deep&#xD;
crimson blush suffused itself over her beautiful face, and&#xD;
she stammered and did not finish the sentence.&#xD;
"Afraid of what? Tell me all, and I will prove wor-&#xD;
thy of your confidence; and, as your proteetor4'it .may&#xD;
be essential that I should'know all."&#xD;
This assurance 'gave Nannie confidence ~to continue&#xD;
the revelation she had unintentionally begun.&#xD;
"The magic of your kindness, and my own profound&#xD;
sense of' obligation and gratitude, inclines me to express&#xD;

MADELINE.                  19-4&#xD;
paired thither. As he entered, a young man ~arose and&#xD;
introduced himself.&#xD;
The personage was Mr. Albinus ,Lindsey.&#xD;
John Leighton was by nature a sociable, OQiflp~fli9n-&#xD;
able man. ~e was, if' we may so speak, a talk-lqver.&#xD;
The few moments preceding tha announcement of read-&#xD;
iness to receive Mr. Lindsey at the supper table ~erve4&#xD;
to remove restraint in a great. measure.&#xD;
After Albinus had concluded his meal and was&#xD;
ducted back to the hail, a conversationn arose,&#xD;
came very animated as it progressed. Mr. Light~&#xD;
charmed by the brilliance of Mr. Lindsey's ta&#xD;
They swept from one- theme to another, and whether&#xD;
on political issues-the probable result of certain? cou$~&#xD;
binations-and theories, and policies-or whether enter-&#xD;
ing the more agreeable field of Theology, the young&#xD;
visitor evinced the same research and ability.&#xD;
It was easy to discover why Nannie had fallen in love&#xD;
with Albinus. True, he was not an Adonis in ~beauty&#xD;
or person, but he possessed what is really more attract-&#xD;
ive to a sensible woman, spirit and intellect, lit was&#xD;
Lindsey's heart-his great sympathetic heart-and his&#xD;
genius that had captured the young, chaste and beauti-&#xD;
f~il girl. Nor did she regard him as being entirely free&#xD;
from faults. She had known him long and well enough&#xD;
to observe those facts,, but they were spots upon the&#xD;
bright face of the sun.&#xD;
Lindsey at length requested the presence of Miss&#xD;
Naunie Leighton.&#xD;
She soon presented herself', and the ardent lover&#xD;
thought she looked even more bewitching than when he&#xD;
saw her at Clifton Yale. Perhaps it was because the&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
H OM E WA RD B OU ND , &amp;amp;c .&#xD;
THE night we saw our friends venture forth, bound&#xD;
for an adventure, from which storm and darkness 'did&#xD;
not deter them, Nannie Leighton was taken away&#xD;
from her cousin's by her friends, and next morning the&#xD;
party, including White Fawn, were on their way to&#xD;
Woodland.&#xD;
Albinus Lindsey had received information that Wol-&#xD;
sey had gone to John Leighton's with the view of ef--&#xD;
fecting the return of Nannie, either by stratagem or&#xD;
force--and he set out to rescue her, and did so.&#xD;
Wolsey was at Leighton's, and having failed to ob-&#xD;
tain Nannie's consent to return, and her cousin having&#xD;
refused to allow her to be taken away forcibly, retired&#xD;
to rest, disappointed and mortified, but. sleep came not&#xD;
to his eyes. Evil thoughts passed through his mind.&#xD;
"I will not be defeated. No, -I swear that my pur-&#xD;
pose shall in no wise be thwarted." These words of&#xD;
soliloquy were spoken so loudly that Wolsey started up&#xD;
lest -he should be overheard by John Leighton in the&#xD;
adjoining chamber.&#xD;
*But hark ! Wolsey starts !&#xD;
"Wolsey! God will resent the wrongs of another!&#xD;
Provoke no more the thunders of His wrath!"&#xD;
These words were distinctly uttered-slowly and sol-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7790-00000090"/>&#xD;
emnly-and Wolsey, half-terrified, started towards the&#xD;
door from whence the soirid proceeded.&#xD;
"Stop! Stir not another inch! How ~.airst thou&#xD;
think to go unwhipped of justh~e? You are a base&#xD;
coward-a snarling puppy-and I have q~i1y to say to&#xD;
you, that Nannie Leighton i~this ~na~ment in the com-&#xD;
pany of friends in the carriage with Albinus Lindsey,&#xD;
and is now ready to leave. You are unworthy of her&#xD;
resentment She forgives you, and ti~usts that you&#xD;
yseek~ and ~btain mercy from thy God!".&#xD;
~W~18ey~ h~ard the retreating footsteps of the one who&#xD;
bad ~ddressed him as above, an4 ~presently the rattling&#xD;
of carriage wheels ia's heard down the road.&#xD;
With beating hearts, and with renewed hopes, the&#xD;
parity traveled tbr days through the wild, unpeopled re-&#xD;
gions of the great1 far North-West. The sky wa~&#xD;
qa1lm, and God's love seemed to be whispered in the&#xD;
pure air above. "Man made the towns," and made&#xD;
theni in hi~ own way~-.shapele~s and ~unseemly as hjm-&#xD;
self~-4he ~pi&amp;amp;ce ~for giggling and stuttering fashion~~---for&#xD;

The party was arrested by a lawless band of rob-&#xD;

"Gentloxnen, aon't detain us! 'Fork over' your&#xD;

A ~ght ensued, but being closed up. in a~ carriage, pur&#xD;

to ~aUy and lixe into thQ carriage. Only sine bi4let&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
IN WITH7.'THE TRAPPERS.&#xD;
NIt~HTFALL set in, and Percy Carson and ~Douglas&#xD;
Hardy were Wandering through the forest. The moon&#xD;
that sheds her light into the alleys and broad streets and&#xD;
i~rowded highways, shone as brightly in the forest; the&#xD;
staV~that glitter above the spires of the city, when the&#xD;
wei~ry ehlldr~n of toil lie down to repose, were not less&#xD;
brilliant in the bhie canopy that spreads over the wilder-&#xD;
ness. Whose heart is so frigid as not feel thrilling&#xD;
emotions of joy, worship and love, and drink in the mys-&#xD;
tic inspiration of Nature, as we behold the :primeval&#xD;
forest? How I have longed, when contending with ad-&#xD;
verse fortunes-striving with the cold world-.struggling&#xD;
to achieve the ends of right living, to retire from the&#xD;
crowded walks* of life to those distant rural retreats,&#xD;
that Nature1might whisper to my troubled spirit, "be&#xD;
still."&#xD;
"Listen !" exclaimed Douglas.&#xD;
They stood still. They* heard the approach of a ye-&#xD;
hide in a Northern direction.&#xD;
"Down!" whispered Percy.&#xD;
They immediately got down upon the ground, and&#xD;
waited in almost breathless suspense.&#xD;
"And, be jabers, will ye niver be after stopping ?"&#xD;
"Mend your English, and we may."&#xD;
&#xD;
MADflLI~E.                 115&#xD;
"Well! it was not myself that learned to mend any-&#xD;
thing; but my ould father-barring it ~as my. uncle-&#xD;
could do the like of it."&#xD;
"You are a cussed fool, that hain't got any sense, to&#xD;
be a bother to us."&#xD;
"Well, it's myself that want's a bit to eat."&#xD;
"If you had as much brains a~ stomach&#xD;
"Och! be jabers! and, by my soul, I had rather have&#xD;
the most stumic.-for there was the chap, little IBai~ney&#xD;
McOonnel, that died when he quit eating."&#xD;
"And there was John Smith that died when he quit&#xD;
breathing."&#xD;
Percey and Douglas, in their prostrate condition,&#xD;
heard the above colloquy, and at once decided to make&#xD;
themselves known to the party who were lumbering along&#xD;
in a two-horse wagon.&#xD;
They arose and crie4 out to the party.&#xD;
They were answered by a yell that sounded like a&#xD;
trumpet through the still forest.&#xD;
"And will ye be after stopping a body?"&#xD;
"Sorry, gentlemen, to detain you, but we are alone&#xD;
in the woods without any food, and ~without the means&#xD;
of a comfortable repose."&#xD;
A brawny fellow thrust his head out through thecur-&#xD;
tam, and said:&#xD;
"Stranger, jist fall in behind, yer have no business to&#xD;
be caught in sich a trap as ye have, but Jerry Ripiim's&#xD;
not the man to niglict a feller-trapper.'~'&#xD;
Douglas and Percy got in, and discovered ~ party of&#xD;
four hardy, rude looking men, lying in the wagon with&#xD;
apparent contentment. The Irishman, who rode one&#xD;
of the houses and drove, made the fifth.&#xD;

~" Tj~ught you were trappers, stranger! but you must&#xD;
be ~onie high4a~rned folks !" spoke Jerry-" city men I&#xD;
reckon ?"&#xD;
"No, we are not 'city men,"' ansWered Douglas-&#xD;
nor are we trappers."&#xD;
"And bless me soul! here's some water, at last!"&#xD;
exclaimed the I~ishma~..-and he brought his horses to&#xD;
a halt, and leaped down with great glee, and began to&#xD;
unh~rness his team.&#xD;
This spot was well adapted for a camp. It was a&#xD;
sni~di, grass-covered valley-that was shut in by abrupt&#xD;
hills on every side. Out of a bluff gushed a bold stream&#xD;
of, water.&#xD;
It. was not long before the horses were alteredd, and&#xD;
the camp~flye raised. The bold and hardy men circled&#xD;
around the fire, while the Irishman, whom they called&#xD;
"old Mal," was busy, preparing a meal. The meat was&#xD;
soon in the pan and frying away, and the steam rose&#xD;
beautifully from the spout of the coffee pot.&#xD;
"Wall, strangers be'nt we're going~ to stay together&#xD;
to-night," sai4 a low but stoutly built man, who, from&#xD;
hi~lQ~ks, was about forty years of age, and a regular&#xD;
backwoodsaian, with a sharp nose and cheek bones, and&#xD;
shr~w4, puck, black eyes-" you may tell whar, you're&#xD;
frum. My names s Bill ilarney, but they c~all me 'old&#xD;
Trap,' case Iv'e caught so many beavers, and the like.&#xD;
'Old Trap' knows all"bont these 'ere parts, and seen&#xD;

paas~e4 to Jerry, who was called ~" old Sueak;". because&#xD;
of the cunning of his character; and then it was hand-&#xD;

could be seen that he was the leader, although he was&#xD;
the youngest, f~r they addressed him yery respectfully&#xD;

drink a fluid that has ~s trown the way to hell with awful&#xD;
wrecks-with mangled bodies-and se~ills, and l~l9od-&#xD;

"You have friends, gentlemen, in these trappers and&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"That's gospel true, Cap'n-' old Trap' is in to catch&#xD;

The rest all responded, even to "old Mal," who cx-&#xD;
"The spalpeens! and could 'myself jist see the bastes,&#xD;

CHAPT1~R XXIY.&#xD;
\VIIITE FAWN'S IMPRISONMENT.&#xD;
THE pearly gates of morning opened wide for the&#xD;
chariot of the Suit The bright sunlight glimme~ed and&#xD;
played upon the little: brook, as beautifully as smiles&#xD;
upon the face of innocent childhood. Little Ilewers,&#xD;
dew-drboped~ raised their heads and opened their petals&#xD;
to behold the sun, and drink in its life-giving r&amp;amp;ys.&#xD;
Iflirds flew out and chirped away, as merrily as boyhood&#xD;
joins in the train of a brilliant ovation, in which mar-&#xD;
tial music mingles.&#xD;
Th~wn in the valley, where we have seen our trappers&#xD;
camp for the night, you could see the smoke ascending&#xD;
upwards, like a grey column, to heaven. The men were&#xD;
all astir, hurrying to depart-some of them at least.&#xD;
it was arranged, the night previous,'that '"Slim Leg"&#xD;
should go early to an ~old liubter's, some four mil~rdis-&#xD;
taut, and obtain two horses, to be employed in scouring&#xD;
the country to find out the robbers, and rescue White&#xD;
Fawn. lie set out while yet the stars were brightly&#xD;
twinkling in the crown of 014 Night-while yet the&#xD;
catydid and locust mingled their unique songs.&#xD;
We have-not attempted to describe the deep agony&#xD;
that was raging in the bosom of P~rcy Carson. As&#xD;
there are sentiments of affection and joy that no tongue&#xD;

<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7790-00000095"/>&#xD;
can speak, no language convey, so there are deep&#xD;
sorrows that' are yet untold and unwritten.&#xD;
What were t~e feelings of White Fawn, a delicate&#xD;
aiid devoted female, borne ruthlessly, by a band of rob-&#xD;
bers, away from one she loved? But let us leave the&#xD;
camp and discover her condition and whereabouts.&#xD;
The two highwaymen, with their captive; pursue&#xD;
their way for tke remainder of the day and the night&#xD;
following. The next morning, early, they rode up to a&#xD;
spjedrnansion, and jkalted at the gate.&#xD;
i~e in, gen~leinen! come i~n, gentlemen! I's b~n&#xD;
lo~k~n' for ~, aome time, Where's the other boys~"&#xD;
Thus spoke a grey~ey~d little ~nan to the two high-&#xD;
w~yWen.x, It was easy tQ detect the mean, scoundrelly&#xD;
p~m~iple. Qf the speaker by the very expression of his&#xD;
1~e~1anee. His eyes were never raised above your&#xD;
feet, and had a wild glassy appearance. A low for~~&#xD;
head, and flat chin, formed the contour of this peculiar&#xD;
soaup4xeb We ~say pe~rn1iar, because he had more ec-&#xD;
cen0~ic ways to illustrate his villany than any man you&#xD;
ever knew or heard of. I do believe if you were to&#xD;
paint, a .worthless picture of a dime-or cut a wood rep-&#xD;
r~sen1~ion ofj one cent, he would steal it the first op-&#xD;
portiuiity-~-not that you had succeeded in deceiving him&#xD;
into the belief that it possessed value, but merely~ for&#xD;
the gratification ~f such a reflection as this: jf it had&#xD;
beezi~ money~ 1unv~qunning1~ 1 got it. Our hero was ~,t&#xD;
the head of the highway~nen all over the country, 4~d&#xD;
his splendid residence was their head-quarters. lie&#xD;
was~ w~akbhy $p iard-Gonzoles~ by name-and had&#xD;
n~oved out. into the ~North-Western territory, perhaps to&#xD;
leave the. pale. of' refined society where he was unwel-&#xD;
&#xD;
'j~-~&#xD;
&#xD;
MA2D~LINE.                 181&#xD;
&#xD;
come; or, it may be, whe~e 'better opportunities of&#xD;
thieving were afforded with less chance for apprehen-&#xD;
sion and punishment. Here he had built, in the'superb&#xD;
old 'Spanish style; a costly '6illa, which was edolosed&#xD;
with a' granite wall some fifteen or twenty feet 'high,&#xD;
which had two heavy, massive iron. gates, ~ne 'at 'the&#xD;
north4ide and the other at the south, at whkh stood&#xD;
sentinels, to admit only those who possessed the secret&#xD;
sign and pass-words. A retinue of servants was kept&#xD;
up-sentinels, porters, grooms, steWards, and ~xn~ssea-&#xD;
gers, so that everything was reduced to a ~tyle of&#xD;
princely living. The building was of granite, with&#xD;
towers running up as wings, at the front cdrners.&#xD;
As'the two highwaymen approached the villa, 'Gon..&#xD;
~oIese was up in one of the towers and beheld'theni at a&#xD;
great distance with ~his spy-glass and he went down to'&#xD;
the~gate to receive them.' As they rode up, the heavy&#xD;
gate swung open, and they entered, and the gate blos~d,&#xD;
and' the great hon bolts gratingly moved back into~t~bir&#xD;
sockets.&#xD;
"Well, Boss," spoke one of the highwaymen, "things&#xD;
haint gone to~ our notion, by no means. The boys had&#xD;
their triggers knocked by some cussed fellers, but we&#xD;
fotch this critter 'long fur you."&#xD;
"Don't say so, gen'men!"&#xD;
"Fact, Boss-give us bringer that crack."&#xD;
Grooms received the horses, and White Fawn was&#xD;
carried by Gonzolese to the east tower. Stairway after&#xD;
stairway was passed-up and up they ascended the dark&#xD;
tower until they reached a room with a 'small window,&#xD;
affording a view in the direction the highwaymen came.&#xD;
This was White Fawn's prison. $he was gruffly pushed&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7790-00000096"/>&#xD;
in and the door was locked from the outside, and the&#xD;
retithig $ootst~ps of old Gonzolese down the long stair~&#xD;
ways belo* was all that greeted White Fawn's ear.&#xD;
She )i~d' no time to behold her situation and to realize&#xD;
fully ~the extent of her misfortune. She walked to the&#xD;
nafl4ow window anci gazed out upon the forest, musingly.&#xD;
"is life real? is hope an allusion ?-an ignis fa-&#xD;
tut~s? Why durst thou toil and struggle, vain, foolish&#xD;
cr~ttire ~f the earth, 'to obtain wealth and 'pomp, when&#xD;
th6t~ ihalt be' crushed as a worm beneath the feet of a&#xD;
gia~ntV' I&#xD;
At~d as~ White Fawn mu~ed, she' beheld far off four&#xD;
horsemen,'arid her eyes kindled with animation, but~ then&#xD;
she reflected th~t they were in all probability robbers.&#xD;
At this reflectionn, her heart sank within her-~-in fact&#xD;
hope, tinder the circumstances, seemed out of the ques-&#xD;
tion..&#xD;
Wearied and heart-sick she drew an old sofa that was&#xD;
in 'the room close to the little window, and exhaneted&#xD;
natuto was ready to seek repose.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
RESCUE AND RE-UNION.&#xD;
WliITE FAWN spent a night of feverish repose. The&#xD;
morning rays of the sun illumined her prison. She&#xD;
arose from her couch and went to her little window to&#xD;
inhale the cool, refreshing morning air, andahe beheld&#xD;
again the horsemen, nearer this time than before. What&#xD;
a thrill of joy she experienced at beholding Percy Car-&#xD;
son and Douglas Hardy. She threw out, from the win-&#xD;
dow, a 'red scarf, and held it by one hand. It fluttered&#xD;
to the breeze some moments before it was discovered by&#xD;
her friends, when she saw them return a sign of recog-&#xD;
nition. Looking down to the yar4 below, she beheld old&#xD;
Gonzolese and the two robbers walking slowly towards&#xD;
tho iron gate in the direction of her friends. She waved&#xD;
her h:t ud and retired from the window.&#xD;
Gow~olcse and the robbers passed out of the yard,&#xD;
and walked slowly up the road. White Fawn returned&#xD;
to witness the result. Moments' of extreme, painful sus-&#xD;
pense passed. Percy Carson and Douglas Hardy and&#xD;
the two trappers watched them narrowly, and at the&#xD;
proper time rushed out' from their covert upon the rob-&#xD;
bers. They were confounded and attempted to flee.&#xD;
"Old hess, now, don't be in sich a fidgity to get back!"&#xD;
naively remarked Slim Leg, extending his long arm and&#xD;
seizing old 'Gouzcilese by the, VhrQat, Tht~ grip was as&#xD;

firm as steel, "Ye old cuss! Slim Leg's gwine to have&#xD;
satisfact on!"&#xD;
"SatiM~etion for what?" gaped Gouzolese.&#xD;
"Fur that lick old Mal gin me! ye cussed booger !"&#xD;
replied Slim Leg, at the same time giving his trembling&#xD;
prisoner a severe bQX. "Old hess, that ain't a circuni-&#xD;
stance !"&#xD;
I' Couldn't say 'bout it's hem' a1 circumstance, but it's&#xD;
a li~z~ll of a lick 1" remarked old Trap, grinning with&#xD;
delight.&#xD;
Whik these incidents were transpiring, the othor two&#xD;
ro~b~s were captured by the rest of the party. Their&#xD;
arm~ *ere pinioned behind them, and they were ordered&#xD;
to return' before their captors to tue mansion.&#xD;
"You only want the lady released, gen'men !" re-&#xD;
niark~d 0onzolese.&#xD;
"That first!" remarked Percy Carson.&#xD;
"Hope ye don't want nothing' else," continued Gon-&#xD;
z&amp;amp;lese.&#xD;
"One thin&#xD;
value g~at a time, sir-and no more words, if you&#xD;
your lives a copper !" replied Douglas Hardy,&#xD;
sharply.&#xD;
~,Tb~other two robbers walked on sullenly.&#xD;
They were presently at the gate, and the sentinel&#xD;
opened it-~and, in his alarm, was about to flee.&#xD;
"Got a word with iou! Brought this here shoe-&#xD;
string 's~essly~ for ye !~' remarked &amp;amp;ld Trap, drawing&#xD;
fro~m hi~ pocket a piece of rope4 "'Sense me!" he cow&#xD;
tinued, "for~ tying yQU!"&#xD;
a ~hort ti~ue the steps were reached, and old ~Gon-&#xD;

the way up the steps while he fo~wed~ close bel~ind&#xD;

robber~~&#xD;
"Old Trap, just walk this here way~!" e~cJaiii~ed Slim&#xD;
Leg. , ." Blast ef they hain't got; a fine breakfast snok-&#xD;
in 'in here!" pointing into a large hall. "Pernal-as&#xD;
the good i~ook says-"&#xD;
"That's a lie! Slim Leg! Derned ain't in the Bible 1"&#xD;
interrupted old Trap.&#xD;
"Pooh! I was gwine to say my bowels yearned after&#xD;
that thar breakfast-derned ef they doesn't!. And&#xD;
'spose we set down and help ourselves, just~ as~ 4 this&#xD;

gwine to git it, as, these cusses, who have no conscience.&#xD;
Slim Leg's gwine before God with a clean conscience 1"&#xD;
Thus spoke Slim Leg, as the two trappers sat down&#xD;
to the table, and began to eat right 'heartily.&#xD;
Going before God with a clean, conscience! What a&#xD;
noble sentiment! Think of it ye that have grown i~pary&#xD;
in your rascality. You that have accumulated wealth&#xD;
by nameles~ and countless little and big villainies. Will&#xD;
you go before God with a clean conscience? Thou ~er~d!&#xD;

"WM~LA~'D! '~ exolaiined the coachman. Wood&#xD;

"~D~t~&amp;amp;a fact! bless God! ~Old Tom neber did spect&#xD;

"And do you design -to stop with us?" asked Ak&#xD;
binus Lindsey, (for we may as well say he is one of the&#xD;
party,) addressing ~an aged gentleman, who alighted&#xD;
fromu the coach.                A&#xD;
"And is this not an inn?" -asked the gentleman,&#xD;

"I need repose, and will ~therefore aceej~ yowr offer&#xD;

The baggage of the ~1d. gentleman was taken oi~t of&#xD;
the coach with the other baggage. The car4s i~poi~ his&#xD;
tvunks bore the inscription: "LeRoy knuanee, Man~&#xD;

rank and intelligence.&#xD;
"But hoW came this trunk marked to Woodland?"&#xD;

for ~the ~1ight, and had been freely permitted to remain.&#xD;
They did not' come 'together, arid were strangers to each&#xD;

'# Loa~rnovtell;" answered Mr. 'Penn'ance-" who' are&#xD;

"What! Hampton Lindsey ?~' exclaimed the other.&#xD;

Could it be reality?.&#xD;
Albinus' looked at his father with am expression of&#xD;
doubt, but all incredulity soon vanished away, when&#xD;
Lindsey exposed a deep scar on his left breast~.&#xD;
"My Father !" explained Madeline, an4 she rtr8hed&#xD;
into the arm~ of Lindsey. He sustii~irie4 her for some&#xD;
minutes, and then, looking earnestly into 'her faee,~said:&#xD;
"No, Madeline! I am not your father; but he is hez'e;"&#xD;
and the speaker turned and pointed to Mr. Pennatice.&#xD;
"Here is your father. Yo~r name is~ not Lindsey, as&#xD;
you have supposed, but Pennance !"&#xD;
LeRoy Pennauce gazed ~earnestly and affectionately&#xD;
upont his beautiful daughter. 'Madeline felt half bewil-&#xD;

lected the conversation between the robbers in the ~~ave.&#xD;
r&#xD;
Mr. Pennanoe received her hand and led her to ~Csofa.&#xD;
'~And it wa~you, father, that sent me the robe from&#xD;

"Yes, my daughter! The material of which it' Was&#xD;
made was bought a great while ago for your mother,&#xD;
who proved unworthy of It, and-"&#xD;
"Who was my mother V" required Madeline.&#xD;
Just at this moment Uncle Tom entered and ran to&#xD;
his master and fell at his feet, crying alotid~ Old m~man&#xD;

nary emotions by springir~g to hjs feet and started back&#xD;
with, paie% ghastly features. This attracted the ~tten-&#xD;
tion of Limd~ey and he addressed him in this wise:&#xD;
"Sir, we~ met here three strangers, under one roof,&#xD;
we wish, now, tOr become acquainted witli you, so that&#xD;
we may enjoy these scenes as friends."&#xD;
"Hampton, you do not ki~w ;me~ ?'~'&#xD;
"Jerrald! thank God, the reunion is perfect."&#xD;
"Forgive me, Hampton !"&#xD;
"In the r~ame of God~ I do."&#xD;
The brothers embraced.&#xD;
"De Lord knows! here'~ massa Jerrald~-a4fter jump-&#xD;

"~Clifton Height I" exclaimed INannie.&#xD;
"Clifton Height!" joined White Fawn and Albin-&#xD;
us Lindsey.&#xD;
"How's this?" asked Douglas Hardy.&#xD;
'~' Wonders will never cease," remarked Percy Car-&#xD;
son.~&#xD;
"What* of my child?" asked Jerrald indsey of uncle&#xD;
Torn.&#xD;
"Iij~'e she is !" replied the old servant gatheri~ig&#xD;
White Fawn in his arms. "Dis is de child, G~brelia,"&#xD;
and he bore Jiek' to her real father, Jerrald Lindsey.&#xD;
"OldTorn was j~i8t gwine to 'vest her wid de 'state,"&#xD;
and as he spoke he drew from his bosom an old greasy&#xD;
p~ckag~, :the one he had received from. Clifton Height.&#xD;
A~W0ll, d~ ~o now !" interrupted Jerrald.&#xD;
"And make the talk I was gwine to?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well," said uncle Tom, clearing his throat, rising&#xD;
proudly and facing the bewildered White Fawn.&#xD;
"Well, Miss White Fawn-.-'cept that ain't your&#xD;
name, it is my duty to give you de 'state left you by&#xD;
your poor dead father, who ain't dead now-but he was&#xD;
dead, case I seed him jump off ob de r6ck."&#xD;
A smile spread over every countenance and shone&#xD;
forth brightly amid tear~.&#xD;
"And what of-of----what of-Mary?" asked Jer-&#xD;
raId of his brother.&#xD;
"Ah! that is ~ painful question," answered Hamp-&#xD;
ton, "but this is the proper time to anSwer it," and as&#xD;
he spoke he regarded LeiRoy Pennance earnestly. "She&#xD;
became the wife of my friend, Pennance, and he was an&#xD;
affectionate, kind, indulgent husband, and their union&#xD;
was blessed with the birth of Madeline-but distrusting&#xD;
and jealous by nature, she doubted her trust-worthy hus-&#xD;
band. She left him, fled to disgrace and infamy. Mad-&#xD;
eline was left to my charge. By her father's request&#xD;
she was to pass as my daughter until she became old&#xD;
enough to know and consider properly the facts con-&#xD;
nected with l1~r unfortunate mother. But let us pass&#xD;
them now, since Mary has long since paid the great debt&#xD;
of nature which, sooner o~ later, all of us must discharge."&#xD;
As the last words were spoken tears gathered in the&#xD;
eyes of .Pennance, and he turned aside.&#xD;
The evening following, witnessed the marriage of the&#xD;
three happy couples.&#xD;
