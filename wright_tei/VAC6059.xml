            <head>DEDICATION.</head>
            <p>I HAVE resolved to dedicate this book to a humorist who has had too little fame, to
               the most delicious, because the most unconscious, humorist, to that widely-scattered
               and multitudinous comedian who may be expressed in the concrete as THE INTELLIGENT
               COMPOSITOR.</p>
            <p>To his habit of perpetrating felicitous absurdities I am indebted for "laughter that
               is worth a hundred groans." It was he who put into type an article of mine which
               contained the remark, "Filtration is sometimes accomplished with the assistance of
               albumen," and transformed it into "Flirtation is sometimes accomplished with the
               resistance of aldermen." It was he who caused me to misquote the poet's inquiry, so
               that I propounded to the world the appalling conundrum, "Where are the dead, the
                  <emph>varnished</emph> dead?" And it was his glorious tendency to make the sublime
               convulsively ridiculous that rejected the line in a poem of mine, which declared that
               a "comet swept o'er the heavens with its trailing skirt," and substituted the idea
               that a "count slept in the haymow in a traveling shirt." The kind of talent that is
               here displayed deserves profound reverence. It is wonderful and awful; and thus I
               offer it a token of my marveling respect.</p>
            <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6059-00000003"/>

               <p>"Fun is the most conservative element of society, and it ought to be cherished and
                  encouraged by all lawful means. People never plot mischief when they are merry.
                  Laughter is an enemy to malice, a foe to scandal and a friend to every virtue. It
                  promotes good temper, enlivens the heart and brightens the intellect."</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT seems to be necessary to say a few words in reference to the contents of this
               volume as I offer it to the public. Several of the incidents related in the story
               have already appeared in print, and have been copied in various newspapers throughout
               the country. Sometimes they have been attributed to the author; but more frequently
               they have been given either without any name attached to them, or they have been
               credited to persons who probably never saw them. The best of the anecdotes have been
               imitated, but none of them, I believe, are imitations. I make this statement, so that
               if the reader should happen to encounter anything that has a familiar appearance, he
               may understand that he has the original and not a copy before him. But a very large
               portion of the matter contained in the book is entirely new, and is now published for
               the first time; while all the rest of it has been rewritten and improved, so that it
               is as good as new.</p>
            <p>If this little venture shall achieve popularity, I must attribute the fact largely to
               the admirable pictures with which it has been adorned by the artists whose names
               appear upon the title page. All of these gentlemen have my hearty thanks for the
               efforts they have made to accomplish the best results; but while I express my
               appreciation of the beautiful landscapes of Mr. Schell, the admirable drawings of Mr.
               Sheppard and the excellent designs of Mr. Bensell, I wish to direct attention
               especially to the humorous pictures of Mr. Arthur B.<pb n="6-7 (Table of Contents) "
                  xml:id="VAC6059-00000004"/> Frost. This artist makes his first appearance before
               the public in these pages. These are the only drawings upon wood that he has ever
               executed, and they are so nicely illustrative of the text, they display so much
               originality and versatility, and they have such genial humor, with so little
               extravagance and exaggeration, that they seem to me surely to give promise of a
               prosperous career for the artist.</p>
            <p>It is customary upon these occasions to say something of an apologetic nature for the
               purpose of inducing the public to believe that the author regards with humility the
               work of which he is really exceedingly proud—something that will tend to soften the
               blows which are expected from ferocious and cruel critics. But I believe I have
               nothing of this kind to offer. If I thought the book required an apology, I would not
               publish it. Any reviewer who does not like it is at liberty to say so; and I am the
               more ready to accord him this permission because I am impressed with the conviction
               that he will hit as hard as he wants to whether I give him leave or withhold it. All
               I ask is that the volume shall have fair play. If it is successful as an attempt to
               construct a book of humor which will contribute to innocent popular amusement without
               violating the laws that govern the construction and orthography of the English
               language, and as an effort to give pleasure to sensible grown people without offering
               entertainment to children and idiots, it deserves commendation. If it is a failure in
               these respects, then it ought to be suppressed, for it certainly has no mighty moral
               purpose, and it is not designed to reform anything on earth but the personal fortunes
               of the author.</p>

               <p>IF Peter Menuit had never been born, it is extremely probable that this book would
                  not have been written. Mr. Menuit, however, had nothing to do with the
                  construction of the volume, and his controlling purpose perhaps was not to prepare
                  the way for it. Peter Menuit was a Swede who in 1631 came sailing up the Delaware
                  River in a queer old craft with bulging sides and with stem and stern high in the
                  air. Moved by some mysterious impulse, he dropped his anchor near a certain
                  verdant shore and landed. Standing there, he surveyed the lovely scene that lay
                  before him in the woodland and the river, and then announced to his companions his
                  determination to remain upon<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6059-00000014"/> that spot.
                  He began to erect a town upon the bank that went sloping downward to the sandy
                  beach, and his only claim to the immortality that has been allotted to him is that
                  he created what is now New Castle.</p>
               <p>It would be pleasant, if it did not seem vain, to hope that New Castle will base
                  its aspirations to enduring fame upon the circumstance that another humble
                  personage came, two hundred years and more after Menuit's arrival, to live in it
                  and to tell, in a homely but amiable fashion, the story of some of its good
                  people, and to say something of a few of their peculiarities, perplexities and
                  adventures.</p>
               <p>We were in search of quietness. The city has many charms and many conveniences as
                  a place of residence; and there are those who, having accustomed themselves to the
                  methods of life that prevail among the dense populations of the great towns, can
                  hardly find happiness and comfort elsewhere. But although the gregarious instinct
                  is strong in me, I cannot endure to be crowded. I love my fellow-man with
                  inexpressible affection, but oftentimes he seems more lovable when I behold him at
                  a distance. I yearn occasionally for human society, but I prefer to have it only
                  when I choose, not at all times and seasons without intermission. In the city,
                  however, it is impossible to secure solitude when it is desired. If I live, as I
                  must, in one of a row of houses, the partition walls upon both sides are likely to
                  be thin. It is possible that I may have upon the one hand a professor of music who
                  gives, throughout the day, maddening lessons to muscular pupils and practices
                  scales himself with energetic persistency duringthe night. Upon the other
                  <figure/> side there may be a family which cherishes two or three infants and
                  sustains a dog. As a faint whisper will penetrate the almost diaphanous wall, the
                  mildest as well as the most violent of the nocturnal demonstrations of the
                  children disturb my sleep; and when these have ceased, the dog will probably
                  become boisterous in the yard.</p>
               <p>If there is not a boiler-making establishment in the street at the rear of the
                  house, there will be a saw-mill with a steam whistle, and it is tolerably certain
                  that my neighbor over the way will either have a vociferous daughter who keeps the
                  window open while she sings, or will permit his boy to perform upon a drum. There
                  is incessant noise in street and yard and dwelling. There is perpetual, audible
                  evidence of the active existence of human beings. There is too much crowding and
                  too little opportunity for absolute withdrawal from the confusion and from contact
                  with the restless energy of human life.</p>
               <p>It has always seemed to me that village life is the happiest and the most
                  comfortable, and that the busy city man who would establish his home where he can
                  have repose without inconvenience and discomfort should place it amid the trees
                  and flowers and by the grassy highway of some pretty hamlet, where the noise of
                  the world's greater commerce never comes, and where isolation and companionship
                  are both possible without an effort. Such a home, planted judiciously in a half
                  acre, where children can romp and play and where one can cultivate a few flowers
                  and vegetables, mingling the sentimental heliotrope with the practical cabbage,
                  and the ornamental verbena with the useful onion, may be made an earthly
                  Paradise.</p>
               <p>There must not be too much ground, for then it becomes a burden and a care. There
                  are few city men who have the agricultural impulse so strong in them that they
                  will find delight, after a day of mental labor and excitement, in
                     <unclear>rasp-</unclear>
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6059-00000015"/> ing a garden with a hoe in the hope of
                  securing a vegetable harvest. A very little exercise of that kind, in most cases,
                  suffices to moderate the horticultural enthusiasm of the inexperienced citizen. It
                  is pleasant enough to weed a few flowers or to toss a spadeful or two of earth
                  about the roots of the grapevine when you feel disposed to such mild indulgence in
                  exercise; but when the garden presents tasks which must be performed no matter
                  what the frame of mind or the condition of the body, you are apt, for the first
                  time, to have a thorough comprehension of the meaning of the curse uttered against
                  the ground when Adam went forth from Eden. It is far better and cheaper to hire a
                  competent man to cultivate the little field; then in your leisure moments you may
                  set out the cabbage plants upside down and place poles for the strawberry vines to
                  clamber upon, knowing well that if evil is done, it will be corrected on the
                  morrow when the offender is far away, and when the maledictions of the
                  agricultural expert, muttered as he relieves the vegetables from the jeopardy in
                  which ignorance has placed them, cannot reach your ears.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I like a house not too old, but having outward comeliness, with judicious
                  arrangement of the interior, and all of those convenient contrivances of the
                  plumber, the furnace-maker and the bell-hanger which make the merest mite of a
                  modern dwelling incomparably superior in comfort to the most stupendous of marble
                  palaces in the ancient times. I would have no neighbor's house within twenty yards
                  upon either side; I would have noble shade trees about the place, and I would
                  esteem it a most fortunate thing if through the foliage I could obtain constant
                  glimpses of some shining stream upon whose bosom ships come to and fro, and on
                  which I could sometimes find solace and exercise in rowing, fishing and
                  sailing.</p>
               <p>Village life is the best. It has all the advantages of residence in the country
                  without the unpleasant things which attend existence in a wholly rural home. There
                  is not the oftentimes oppressive solitude of the country, nor is there the
                  embarrassment that comes from the distance to the station, to the shops and to the
                  post-office. There are the city blessings of the presence of other human beings,
                  and of access to the places where wants may be supplied, without the crowds,
                  without the mixed and villainous perfumes of the streets and without the
                  immoderate taxes. With the conveniences of a civilized community, a village may
                  have pure and healthful air, opportunity for parents and children to amuse
                  themselves out of doors, cheap fare, moderate rent, milk which knows not the wiles
                  of the city dealer, and a moral atmosphere in which a family may grow up away from
                  the temptations and the evil associations which tend to corrupt the young in the
                  great cities.</p>
               <p>More than this, I like life in the village because it brings a man into kindlier
                  relations with his fellows than can be obtained elsewhere. In the city I am
                  jostled at every step by those who are strangers to me, who know nothing of me,
                  and who care nothing. In the village I am known by every one, and I know all. If I
                  have any title to respect, it is admitted by the entire society of the place, and
                  perhaps I may even win something of affection if I am worthy of it.</p>
               <p>In the country town, too, you may have your morals carefully looked after. There
                  are prying eyes and busy tongues, and you are so conspicuous that unless you walk
                     straightly,<pb n="30-31 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6059-00000016"/> the little
                  world around you shall know of your slips and falls. You may quarrel with your
                  wife for ever in the city and few care to hear the miserable story; but in the
                  village the details of the conjugal contest are heralded about before the day is
                  spent.</p>
               <p>The interest that is felt in you is amazing. The cost of your establishment is as
                  well known as if it were blazoned upon the walls. You cannot impose upon the
                  people with a pretence of splendor if you have not the reality; one gossiping old
                  woman who has discovered the sham will make you an object of public scorn in an
                  hour. The village knows how your children are dressed and trained; how often you
                  have mutton and the extent of your indulgence in beef. The cost of your carpets is
                  a matter of common notoriety; your differences with your servants are discussed at
                  the sewing-circle, and the purchase of new clothing for your family is a concern
                  of public interest. The arrival of your wife's winter bonnet actually creates
                  excitement in the village society, and you are certain, therefore, to get the full
                  worth of your investment in that article of dress, while the owner obtains
                  unlimited satisfaction; for winter bonnets are purchased for the benefit of other
                  people chiefly, not for the convenience and happiness of the wearers.</p>
               <p>Every man is something of a hero-worshiper; and if in the city I find it difficult
                  to select an idol from among the many who thrust their greatness upon me, I am not
                  so embarrassed in the village. Here I will probably find but one man who is
                  revered as the embodiment of the worshipful virtues. He has larger wealth than any
                  of his fellow-villagers; he lives in the most sumptuous house in the place; he
                  belongs to the oldest family, and his claim to superiority is admitted almost
                  without question by his reverent townsmen. It gives me joy to add my voice to the
                  chorus of admiration, and to feel humble in that presence<figure>
                     <head>NEW CASTLE FROM THE RIVER.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6059-00000017"/> wherein my neighbors have humility.
                  Sometimes, of course, I cannot help perceiving that the object of this adoration
                  is, after all, a very pigmy of his kind. I am compelled to admit that his fortune
                  seems large only because mine and Jones's are small; that his house is a palace
                  only for the reason that it dwarfs my little cottage; that if unassisted brains
                  carried the day, and strutting was felonious, he would certainly occupy a much
                  less magnificent position. I know that in a greater community he would be wholly
                  insignificant. And yet I admit his claim to profound respect. It pleases me to see
                  him play his little part, and to observe with what calm, luxurious confidence in
                  his own right and title to homage he passes through life. And I know, after all,
                  that the greater men, out in the busy hurly-burly of the world, are not so very
                  much greater. A good deal of their claim to superiority, too, is a miserable sham;
                  and doubtless, if we could see them as closely as we see our village grandee, we
                  should find that they also depend much upon popular credulity for the stability of
                  their reputations.</p>
               <p>My pompous village nabob, too, is honest. I am sure of this. He helps to conduct
                  the government of the community, but he does his duty fairly and he is a
                  gentleman. I could love him for that alone, and for that feel a deeper affection
                  for life in his village. When I go to the city and perceive what creatures wield
                  the power there, when I watch the trickery, the iniquity, the audacious infamy, of
                  the cliques that control the machinery of that great government, and when I look,
                  as I do sometimes, into the faces of those who are thus leagued for plunder and
                  power, only to see there vulgarity, ignorance, vice and general moral filthiness,
                  my soul is made sick. I can turn then with pleasure to the simple methods with
                  which our village is governed, and honestly give my respect to the guileless old
                  gentleman who presides over its destinies.</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6059-00000018"/>
               <p>We wish for quietness, and in New Castle it can be obtained, I think, in a
                  particularly concentrated form. When Swede and Dutchman and Englishman had done
                  contending for possession of the place, there was peace until the Revolution came,
                  and with it ships of war and privateers, and such hurrying of troops and supplies
                  across from New Castle to Frenchtown, from the Delaware to the Chesapeake, as kept
                  the old town in a stir. There was then an interval of repose until the second war
                  with England, when these busy scenes were re-enacted. Later in the century a
                  mighty stir was made by the construction of a railroad, one of the earliest in the
                  country, to Chesapeake Bay; then, as the excitement died away, the old town
                  gradually went to sleep, and for nearly forty years it slumbered so soundly that
                  there seemed to be a chance that it would never wake again. But time achieves
                  wonderful things, and perhaps the day will come when the vicinity of the old town
                  to the bay, the depth of water at its shores and the facilities offered for
                  manufacturing and easy transportation, may make the village a great industrial
                  centre, with hundreds of mills and multitudes of working-people. But as we join
                  ourselves to the community there is no promise of such an awakening. We have still
                  the profound repose and the absence of change that make the place so dear to those
                  who have known it in their childhood. There are the paved streets where the grass
                  grows thickly; the ancient wharves protruding into the stream, deserted but by the
                  anglers and the naked and wicked little boys who go in to swim; the tumbling stone
                  ice-piers, a little way out in the river; the old court-house, whose steeple is
                  the point upon which moves the twelve-mile radial line whose northern end
                  describes the semi-circular boundary of Delaware; the rickety town-hall, the
                  ancient churches and the grim old houses with moss-covered roofs, the Battery,
                  with its drooping willows and its glorious vista of river and shore beyond, and
                  the dense masses of foliage, shutting out the sky here and there as one passes
                  along the streets.</p>
               <p>Into such a house as I have described, not far from the river, and with our
                  neighbors at a little more than arm's length, I have come with wife and family,
                  with household gods and domestic paraphernalia generally, to begin the life which
                  will supply the material wherewith to construct the ensuing pages. It may perhaps
                  turn out that the better part of that existence will not be told, but perchance it
                  may be that the events related will be those which will possess for the reader
                  greatest interest and amusement.</p>

               </p>
               <p>STEP-LADDER is an almost indispensable article to persons who are moving into a
                  new house. Not only do the domestics find it extremely convenient when they
                  undertake to wash the windows, to remove the dust from the door and window-frames,
                  and to perform sundry other household duties, but the lord of the castle will
                  require it when he hangs his pictures, when he fixes the curtains and when he
                  yields to his wife's entreaty for a hanging shelf or two in the cellar. I would,
                  however, warn my fellow-countrymen against the contrivance which is offered to
                  them under the name of the "Patent Combination Step-ladder." I purchased one in
                  the city just before we moved, because the dealer showed me how, by the simple
                  operation of a set of springs, the ladder could be transformed into an
                  ironing-table, and from that into a comfortable settee for the kitchen, and
                  finally back again into a step-ladder, just as the owner desired. It seemed like
                  getting ting the full worth of the money expended to obtain a trio of such useful
                  articles for a single price, and the temptation to purchase was simply
                  irresistible. But the knowledge gained by a practical experience of the operation
                  of the machine enables me to affirm that there is no genuine economical advantage
                  in the use of this ingenious article.</p>
               <p>Upon the day of its arrival, the servant-girl mounted the ladder for the purpose
                  of removing the globes from the chandelier in the parlor, and while she was
                  engaged in the work the weight of her body unexpectedly put the springs in motion,
                  and the machine was suddenly converted into an <figure/> ironing-table, while the
                  maid-servant was prostrated upon the floor with a sprained ankle and amid the
                  fragments of two shattered globes.</p>
               <p>Then we decided that the apparatus should be used exclusively as an ironing-table,
                  and to this purpose it would probably have been devoted permanently if it had
                  suited. On the following Tuesday, however, while half a dozen<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000020"/> shirts were lying upon it ready to be ironed, some
                  one knocked against it accidentally. It gave two or three ominous preliminary
                  jerks, ground two shirts into rags, hurled the flat-iron out into the yard, and
                  after a few convulsive movements of the springs, settled into repose in the shape
                  of a step-ladder.</p>
               <p>It became evident then that it could be used with greatest safety as a settee, and
                  it was placed in the kitchen in that shape. For a few days it gave much
                  satisfaction. But one night when the servant had company the bench was perhaps
                  overloaded, for it had another and most alarming paroxysm; there was a trembling
                  of the legs, a violent agitation of the back, then a tremendous jump, and one of
                  the visitors was hurled against the range, while the machine turned several
                  somersaults, jammed itself halfway through the window-sash, and appeared once more
                  in the similitude of an ironing-table.</p>
               <p>It has now attained to such a degree of sensitiveness that it goes through the
                  entire drill promptly and with celerity if any one comes near it or coughs or
                  sneezes close at hand. We have it stored away in the garret, and sometimes in the
                  middle of the night a rat will jar it, or a current of air will pass through the
                  room, and we can hear it dancing over the floor and getting into service as a
                  ladder, a bench and a table fifteen or twenty times in quick succession.</p>
               <p>The machine will be disposed of for a small fraction of the original cost. It
                  might be a valuable addition to the collection of some good museum. I am convinced
                  that it will shine with greater lustre as a curiosity than as a household
                  utensil.</p>
               <p>Perhaps we may attribute to the fantastic capers of this step-ladder the
                  dissatisfaction expressed by the servant who came with us from the city; at any
                  rate, she gave us notice at the end of the first week that she would not remain.
                  She is the ninth that we have had within four months. Mrs. Adeler said she was not
                  sorry the woman intended to go, for she was absolutely good for nothing; but I
                  think a poor servant is better than none at all. Life is gloomy enough without the
                  misery which comes from rising before daylight to fumble among the fires, and
                  without living upon short rations because one's wife has no time to attend to the
                  cooking.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I am not sure, at any rate, that it would be a very great advantage to have
                  thoroughly good servants, for then women would be deprived of the very evident
                  pleasure they now take in discussing the shortcomings of their domestics. The
                  practice is so common that there must be supreme consolation in the sympathy and
                  in the relief to the overcharged feelings that are permitted by such
                  communion.</p>
               <p>Place two women together under any circumstances, and it makes no difference where
                  the conversation starts from, for it will be perfectly certain to work around to
                  the hired-girl question before many minutes have elapsed. I have seen an elderly
                  housekeeper, with experience in conducting the talk in the desired direction,
                  break in upon a discussion of Pythagoras and the doctrine of the transmigration of
                  souls, and switch off the entire debate with such expedition that a careless
                  listener would for some moments have an indistinct impression that the
                  conversation referred to the inefficiency of Pythagoras as a washer and ironer,
                  and to the tendency of that heathen philosopher to take two Thursdays out every
                  week.</p>
               <p>And when a woman has an unusually villainous servant, is it not interesting to
                  observe how she glories in the superior intensity of her sufferings as compared
                  with those of<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6059-00000021"/> her neighbors, and to
                  perceive how she rejoices in her misery? A housewife who possesses a really good
                  girl is always in a condition of wretchedness upon such occasions, and is apt to
                  listen in envious silence while her companions unburden their souls to each
                  other.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adeler intimated that these accusations were slanderous, but she ventured to
                  observe that the practical question which required immediate consideration was,
                  How shall we get another girl?</p>
               <p>"There is but one method, Mrs. A.: it is to advertise. Do not patronize the
                  establishments which, in bitter irony, are styled 'intelligence offices.' An
                  intelligence office is always remarkable for the dense stupidity of everybody
                  connected with it. But a single manifestation of intelligence gleams through the
                  intellectual darkness that enshrines the souls of the beings who maintain such
                  places. I refer to the singular ability displayed in extracting two-dollar bills
                  from persons who know that they will get nothing for their money."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adeler admitted that it would perhaps be better to advertise.</p>
               <p>"How would it answer to insert in the daily paper an advertisement in which
                  sarcasm is mingled with exaggeration in such a way that it shall secure an
                  unlimited number of applications, while we shall give expression to the feeling of
                  bitterness that is supposed to exist in the bosom of every housekeeper?"</p>
               <p>She said she thought she hardly caught the idea precisely.</p>
               <p>"Suppose, for instance, we should publish something like this: 'Wanted: a
                  competent girl for general housework. The most strenuous effort will be made to
                  give such a person complete satisfaction. If she is not pleased with the furniture
                  already in the kitchen, we are willing to have the range silver plated, the floor
                  laid in mosaic and the dresser covered with pink plush. No objection will be made
                  to breakage. The domestic will be permitted at any time to disport in the china
                  closet with the axe. We consider hair in the breakfast-rolls an improvement; and
                  the more silver forks that are dropped into the drain, the more serene is the
                  happiness which reigns in the household. Our girl cannot have Sunday out. She can
                  go out every day but Sunday, and remain out until midnight if she wishes to. If
                  her relations suffer for want of sugar, she can supply them with ours. We rather
                  prefer a girl who habitually blows out the gas, and who is impudent when complaint
                  is made because she soaks the mackerel in the tea-kettle. If she can sprinkle hot
                  coals over the floor now and then, and set the house afire, we will rejoice the
                  more, because it will give the fire-department healthful and necessary exercise.
                  Nobody will interfere if she woos the milkman, and she will confer a favor if she
                  will discuss family matters across the fence with the girl who lives next door.
                  Such a servant as this can have a good home, the second-story front room and the
                  whole of our income with the exception of three dollars a week, which we must
                  insist, reluctantly, upon reserving for our own use.'</p>
               <p>"How does that strike you, Mrs. Adeler?"</p>
               <p>She said that it struck her as being particularly nonsensical. She hoped I
                  wouldn't put such stuff as that in the paper.</p>
               <p>"Certainly not, Mrs. A. If I did, we should cause a general immigration of the
                  domestics of the country to New Castle. We will not precipitate such a
                  disaster."</p>
               <p>The insertion of a less extended advertisement, couched in the usual terms,
                  secured a reply from a young woman named Catherine. And when Catherine's
                  objections to the size of the family, to the style of the cooking-range, to the<pb
                     n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6059-00000022"/> dimensions of the weekly wash and to
                  sundry other things had been overcome, she consented to accept the position.</p>
               <p>"I hope she will suit," exclaimed Mrs. Adeler, with a sigh and an intonation which
                  implied doubt. "I do hope she will answer, but I am afraid she won't, for
                  according to her own confession she doesn't know how to make bread or to iron
                  shirts or to do anything."</p>
               <p>"That is the reason why she demanded such exorbitant wages. Those servants who are
                  entirely ignorant always want the largest pay. If we ever obtain a girl who
                  understands her business in all its departments, I cherish the conviction that she
                  will work for us for nothing. The wages of domestics are usually in inverse ratio
                  to the merit of the recipients. Did you ever reflect upon the difference between
                  the real and the ideal Irish maiden?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. A. admitted that she had not considered the subject with any degree of
                  attention.</p>
               <p>"The ideal peasant-girl lives only in fiction and upon the stage. We are largely
                  indebted to Mr. Boucicault for her existence, just as we are under obligations to
                  Mr. Fennimore Cooper for a purely sentimental conception of the North American
                  Indian. Have you ever seen the <title>Colleen Bawn?</title>"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"What is that?" inquired Mrs. Adeler, as she bit off a piece of thread from a
                  spool.</p>
               <p>"It is a play, a drama, my dear, by Mr. Dion Boucicault."</p>
               <p>"You know I never go to theatres."</p>
               <p>"Well, in that and in many other of his dramas Mr. Boucicault has drawn a
                  particularly affecting portrait of the imaginary peasant-girl of Ireland. She is,
                  as depicted by him, a lovely young creature, filled with tenderest sensibility,
                  animated by loftiest impulses and inspired perpetually by poetic enthusiasm. The
                  conversation of this fascinating being sparkles with wit; she overflows with
                  generosity; she has unutterable longings for a higher and nobler life; she loves
                  with intense and overpowering passion; she is capable of supreme self-sacrifice;
                  and she always wears clean clothing. If such charming girls really existed in
                  Ireland in large numbers, it would be the most attractive spot in the world. It
                  would be a particularly profitable place for young bachelors to emigrate to. I
                  think I should even go there myself."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adeler said she would certainly accompany me if I did.</p>
               <p>"But these persons have no actual existence. We know, from a painful experience,
                  what the peasant-girl of real life is, do we not? We know that her appearance is
                  not prepossessing; we are aware that her lofty impulses do not lift her high
                  enough to enable her to avoid impertinence and to conquer her unnatural fondness
                  for cooking wine. She will withhold starch from the shirt collars and put it in
                  the underclothing; she will hold the baby by the leg, so that it is in perpetual
                  peril of apoplexy, and she will drink the milk. All of her visitors are her
                  cousins; and when they have spent a festive evening with her in the kitchen, is it
                  not curious to remark with what certainty we find low tide in the sugar-box and an
                  absence of symmetry about the cold beef? The only evidence that I can discover of
                  the existence in her soul of a yearning for a higher life is that she nearly
                  always wants Brussels carpet in the kitchen, and this longing is peculiarly
                  intense if, when at the home of her childhood, she was accustomed to live in a
                  mud-cabin and to sleep with a pig."</p>

               <p>But I do not regret that Mr. Boucicault has not placed this person upon the stage.
                  It is, indeed, a matter for rejoicing that she is not there. She plays such a part
                  in the drama of domestic life that in contemplation of the virtues of the fabulous
                  being we find intense relief.</p>

               <p>WE have a full view of the river from our chamber window, and it is a magnificent
                  spectacle that greets us as we rise in the morning and fling the shutters wide
                  open. The sun, in this early summer-time, has already crept high above the horizon
                  of the pine-covered shore opposite, and has flooded the unruffled waters with its
                  golden light until they are transformed for us into a sea of flame. There comes a
                  fleet of grimy coal schooners moving upward with the tide, their dingy sails
                  hanging almost listless in the air; now they float, one by one, into the yellow
                  glory of the sunshine which bars the river from shore to shore. Yonder is a tiny
                  tug puffing valorously as it tows the great merchantman—home from what distant
                  land of wonders?—up to the wharves of the great city. And look! there is another
                  tug-boat going down stream, with a score of canal-boats moving in huge mass slowly
                  behind it. They come from far up among the mountains of the Lehigh<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000025"/> and the Schuylkill with their burdens of coal, and
                  they are bound for the Chesapeake. Those men lounging lazily about upon the decks
                  while the women are getting breakfast ready spend their lives amid some of the
                  wildest and noblest scenery in the world. I would rather be a canal-boat captain,
                  Mrs. Adeler, and through all my existence float calmly and serenely amid those
                  regions of beauty and delight, without ever knowing what hurry is, than to be the
                  greatest and busiest of statesmen—that is, if one calling were as respectable and
                  lucrative as the other.</p>
               <p>That fellow upon the boat at the rear is playing upon his bugle. The canal-boat
                  bugler is not an artist, but he makes wonderful music sometimes when he blows a
                  blast up yonder in the heart of Pennsylvania, and sets the wild echoes flying
                  among the cañons of those mighty hills. And even now it is not indifferent.
                  Listen! The tones come to us mellowed by the distance, and so indistinct that they
                  have lost all but the sweetness which makes them seem so like the sound of <q>
                     <l>"Horns of Elfland, faintly blowing."</l>
                  </q>

               </p>
               <p>That prosaic tooter floating there upon the river doubtless would be surprised to
                  learn that he is capable of such a suggestion; but he is.</p>
               <p>Off there in the distance, emerging from the shadowy mantle of mist that rests
                  still upon the bosom of the stream to the south, comes the steamboat from Salem,
                  with its decks loaded down with rosy and fragrant peaches, and with baskets of
                  tomatoes and apples and potatoes and berries, ready for the hungry thousands of
                  the Quaker City. The schooner lying there at the wharf is getting ready to move
                  away, so that the steamer may come in. You can hear the screech made by the block
                  as the tackle of the sail is drawn swiftly through it. Now she swings out into the
                  stream, and there, right athwart her bows, see that fisherman rowing homeward with
                  his net piled high in tangled meshes in the bow of his boat. He has a hundred or
                  two silver-scaled shiners at his feet, I'll warrant you, and he is thinking rather
                  of the price they will bring than of the fact that his appearance in his rough
                  batteau gives an especially picturesque air to the beauty of that matchless scene.
                  I wish I was a painter. I would pay any price if I could fling upon canvas that
                  background of hazy gray, and place against it the fiery splendor of the sunlit
                  river, with steamer and ship and weather-beaten sloop and fishing-boat drifting to
                  and fro upon the golden tide.</p>
               <p>There, too, is old Cooley, our next-door neighbor on the east. He is out early
                  this morning, walking about his garden, pulling up a weed here and there, prowling
                  among his strawberry vines and investigating the condition of his early
                  raspberries. That dog which trots behind him, my dear, is the one that barked all
                  night. I shall have to ask Cooley to take him in the house after this. We had
                  enough of that kind of disturbance in the city; we do not want it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"I don't like the Cooleys," remarked Mrs. A.</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Because they quarrel with each other. Their girl told our girl that 'him and her
                  don't hit it,' and that Mr. Cooley is continually having angry disputes with his
                  wife. She says that sometimes they even come to blows. It is dreadful."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed dreadful. Somebody ought to speak to<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000026"/> Cooley about it. He needs overhauling. Perhaps he
                  is too ignorant a man to have perceived the true road to happiness. Of course,
                  Mrs. A., <emph>you</emph> know the secret of real happiness in married life?"</p>
               <p>She said she had never thought much about it. She was happy, and it seemed natural
                  to be so. She thought it very strange that there should ever be any other
                  condition of things between man and wife.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Adeler, the secret of conjugal felicity is contained in this formula:
                  demonstrative affection and self-sacrifice. A man should not only love his wife
                  dearly, but he should tell her he loves her, and tell her very often. And each
                  should be willing to yield, not once or twice, but constantly and as a practice,
                  to the other. The man who never takes the baby from his wife, who never offers to
                  help her in her domestic duties, who will sit idly by, indulging himself with
                  repose while she is overwhelmed with care and work among the children, or with
                  other matters, is a mean wretch who does not deserve to have a happy home. And a
                  wife who never holds up her husband's hands in his struggle with the world, who
                  displays no interest in his perplexities and trials, who has never a word of cheer
                  for him when he staggers under his heavy burden, is not worthy the name of a wife.
                  Selfishness, my dear, crushes out love, and most of the couples who are living
                  without affection for each other, with cold and dead hearts, with ashes where
                  there should be a bright and holy flame, have destroyed themselves by caring too
                  much for themselves and too little for each other."</p>
               <p>"To me," said Mrs. Adeler, "the saddest thing about such coldness and indifference
                  is that both the man and the woman must sometimes think of the years when they
                  loved each other."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and can you imagine anything that would be more likely to give a woman the
                  heartache than such a recollection lection? When her husband comes home and enters
                  the house without a smile or a word of welcome; when he growls at his meals, and
                  finds fault with this and that domestic arrangement; when he buries his nose in
                  his newspaper after supper, and never resurrects it excepting when he has a savage
                  word of reproof for one of his children, or when he goes out again to spend the
                  evening and leaves his wife alone, the picture which she brings up from the past
                  cannot be a very pleasant one.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, my dear, the man's present conduct must fill the woman's soul with bitter
                  pain when she contrasts it with that which won her affection. For there must have
                  been a time when she looked forward with joy to his coming, when he caressed her
                  and covered her with endearments, when he looked deep into her eyes and said that
                  he loved her, and when he said that he could have no happiness in this world
                  unless she loved him wholly and truly. When a man makes such a declaration as that
                  to a woman, he is a villain if he ever treats her with anything but
                  loving-kindness. And I take the liberty of doubting whether he who leads a young
                  girl into wedlock with such pledges, and then acts in direct violation of them,
                  ought not to be prosecuted for obtaining valuable consideration upon false
                  pretences. It is infinitely worse, in my opinion, than stealing ordinary
                  property."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adeler expressed the opinion that death at the stake might be regarded as an
                  appropriate punishment for criminals of this class.</p>
               <p>"But there is a humorous side even to this melancholy business. Do you remember
                  the Sawyers, who used to live near us in the city? Well, before Sawyer's marriage
                  I was his most intimate friend; and when they returned from their wedding-trip, of
                  course I called upon them. Mrs. Sawyer alone was at home, and after a brief
                  discussion of the weather, the conversation turned upon Sawyer. I had<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000027"/> known him for many years, and I took pleasure in
                  making Mrs. Sawyer believe that he had as much virtue as an omnibus load of
                  patriarchs. Mrs. Sawyer assented joyously to it all, but I thought I detected a
                  shade of sadness on her face while she spoke. I asked her if anything was the
                  matter—if Sawyer's health was not good.</p>
               <p>"'Oh yes,' she said, 'very good indeed, and I love him dearly. He is the best man
                  in the world; but—but—'</p>
               <p>"Then I assured Mrs. Sawyer that she might speak frankly to me, as I was Sawyer's
                  friend, and could probably smooth away any little unpleasantness that might mar
                  their happiness. She then said it was nothing. It might seem foolish to speak of
                  it; she knew it was not her dear husband's fault, and she ought not to complain;
                  but it was hard, hard to submit when she reflected that there was but one thing to
                  prevent her being perfectly happy; yes, but one thing, 'for oh, Mr. Adeler, I
                  would ask for nothing more in this world if Ezekiel only had a Roman nose!'</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"It is an awful thing, Mrs. Adeler, to think of two young lives being made
                  miserable for want of one Roman nose, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. A. gently intimated that she entertained a suspicion that I had made up the
                  story; and if I had not, why, then Mrs. Sawyer certainly was a very foolish
                  woman.</p>
               <p>My wife's cousin, Bob Parker, came down a fortnight ago to stay a day or two on
                  his way to Cape May, with the intent to tarry at that watering-place for a week or
                  ten days, and then to return here to remain with us for some time. Bob is a bright
                  youth, witty in his own small way, fond of using his tongue, and always
                  overflowing with animal spirits. He came partly to see us, but chiefly, I think,
                  because he cherishes a secret passion for a certain fair maid who abides here.</p>
               <p>He brought me a splendid present in the shape of an American agave, or century
                  plant. It was offered to him in Philadelphia by a man who brought it to the store
                  and wanted to sell it. The man said it had belonged to his <figure/> grandfather,
                  and he consented to part with it only because he was in extreme poverty. The man
                  informed Bob that the plant grew but half an inch in twenty years, and blossomed
                  but once in a century. The last time it bloomed, according to the information
                  obtained from the gray-haired grandsire of the man, was in 1776, and it would
                  therefore certainly burst out again in 1876. Patriotism and a desire to have such
                  a curiosity in the family combined to induce Mr. Parker to purchase it at the
                  price of fifty dollars.</p>
               <p>I planted the phenomenon on the south side of the house<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000028"/> against the wall. Two days afterward I called Bob's
                  attention to the circumstance that the agave had grown nearly three feet since it
                  was placed in the ground. This seemed somewhat strange after what the man said
                  about the growth of half an inch in two decades. But we concluded that the
                  surprising development must be due to the extraordinary fertility of the soil, and
                  Bob exulted as he thought how he had beaten the man by getting a century plant so
                  much larger and so much more valuable than he had supposed. Bob said that the man
                  would be wofully mad if he should call and see that century plant of his
                  grandfather's getting up out of the ground so splendidly.</p>
               <p>That afternoon we all went down to Cape May, and for two weeks we remained there.
                  Upon our return, Bob remarked, as we stepped from the boat, that he wanted to go
                  around the first thing and see how the plant was coming on. He suggested gloomily
                  that he should be bitterly disappointed if it had perished from neglect during our
                  absence.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But it was not dead. We saw it as soon as we came near the house. It had grown
                  since our departure. It had a trunk as thick as my leg, and the branches ran
                  completely over three sides of the house; over the window shutters, which were
                  closed so tightly that we had to chop the century plant away with a hatchet; over
                  the roof, down the chimneys, which were so filled with foliage that they wouldn't
                  draw; and over the grapevine arbor, in such a fashion that we had to cut away
                  vines and all to get rid of the intruder.</p>
               <p>The roots, also, had thrown out shoots over every available square foot of the
                  yard, so that I had eight or ten thousand century plants in an exceedingly
                  thriving condition, while a branch had grown through the open cellar window, and
                  was getting along so finely that we could only reach the coal-bin by tramping
                  through a kind of an East Indian jungle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parker, after examining the vegetable carefully, observed:</p>
               <p>"I'm kind of sorry I bought that century plant, Max. I have half an idea that the
                  man who sold it to me was a humorist, and that his Revolutionary grandfather was
                  an octogenarian fraud."</p>
               <p>If anybody wants a good, strong, healthy century plant that will stand any
                  climate, and that is warranted to bloom in 1876, mine can be had for a very
                  reasonable price. This may be regarded as an unparalleled opportunity for any
                  young agriculturist who does not want to wait long for his vegetables to grow.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>MY next-door neighbor upon the west is Judge Pitman. I heard his name mentioned
                  before I became acquainted with him, and I fancied that he was either a present
                  occupant of the bench, or else that he had gone into retirement after spending his
                  active life in dispensing justice and unraveling the tangles of the law. But it
                  appears that he has never occupied a judicial position, and that his title is
                  purely complimentary, having no relation whatever to the nature of his pursuits
                  either in the past or in the present. The judge, indeed, is merely the owner of a
                  couple of steam-tugs and one or two wood sloops which ply upon the river and upon
                  Chesapeake Bay. He spends most of his time at home, living comfortably upon the
                  receipts of a business which is conducted by his hired men, and perhaps also upon
                  the interest of a few good investments in this and other places.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>A very brief acquaintance with the judge suffices to convince any one that he has
                  never presided in court. He is a rough, uneducated man, with small respect for
                  grammar, an irrepressible tendency to distort the language, and very little
                  information concerning subjects which are not made familiar by the occurrences of
                  every-day life. But he is hearty, genial, sincere and honest, and I very soon
                  learned to like him and to find amusement in his quaint simplicity.</p>
               <p>My first interview with the judge was somewhat remarkable. I came home early one
                  afternoon for the purpose of training some roses and clematis against my fence.
                  While I was busily engaged with the work, the judge, who had been <figure/>
                  digging potatoes in his garden, stuck his spade in the earth and came to the
                  fence. After looking at me in silence for a few moments, he observed,</p>
               <p>"Fine day, cap!"</p>
               <p>The judge has the habit of conferring titles promiscuously and without
                  provocation, particularly upon strangers. To call me "cap." was his method of
                  expressing a desire for sociability.</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> a beautiful day," I observed, "but the country needs
                  rain."</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6059-00000030"/>
               <p>"It never makes no difference to me," replied the judge, "what kinder weather
                  there is; I'm allers satisfied. 'Twon't rain no sooner for wishin' for it."</p>
               <p>As there was no possibility of our having a controversy upon this point, I merely
                  replied, "That is true."</p>
               <p>"How's yer pertaters comin' on?" inquired the judge.</p>
               <p>"Very well, I believe. They're a little late, but they appear to be thriving."</p>
               <p>"Mine's doin' first rate," returned the judge. "I guannered them in the spring,
                  and I've bin a-hoein' at 'em and keepin' the weeds down putty stiddy ever since.
                  Mons'ous sight o' labor growin' good pertaters, cap."</p>
               <p>"I should think so," I rejoined, "although I haven't had much practical experience
                  in that direction thus far."</p>
               <p>"Cap.," observed the judge, after a brief interval of silence, "you're one of them
                  fellers that writes for the papers and magazines, a'n't you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I sometimes do work of that kind."</p>
               <p>"Well, see here: I've got somethin' on my mind that's bin a-botherin' me the wust
                  kind for a week and more. You've read the 'Atlantic Monthly,' haven't you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, my daughter bought one of 'em, and I was a-readin' it the other night, when
                  I saw it stated that guanner could be influenced by music, and that Professor
                  Brown had made some git up and come to him when he played a tune on the
                  pianner."</p>
               <p>I remembered, as the judge spoke, that the magazine in question did contain a
                  paragraph to the effect that the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">iguana</foreign> was
                  susceptible of such influence, and that Mrs. Brown had succeeded in taming one of
                  these animals, so that it would run to her at the sound of music. But I permitted
                  Mr. Pitman to continue without interruption.</p>
               <p>"Of course," said he, "I never really believed no such nonsense as that, but it
                  struck me as kinder sing'lar, and I thought I'd give the old thing a trial,
                  anyhow. So I got down my fiddle and went to the barn, and put a bag of guanner in
                  the middle of the floor and begun to rake out a tune. First I played 'A Life on
                  the Ocean Wave and a Home on the Rollin' Deep' three or four times; and there that
                  guanner sot, just as I expected 'twould. Then I begun agin and sawed out a lot o'
                  variations, but still she didn't budge. Then I put on a fresh spurt and jammed in
                  a passel o' extra sharps and flats and exercises; and I played that tune backward
                  and sideways and cat-a-cornered. And <figure/> I stirred in some scales, and mixed
                  the tune up with Old Hundred and Mary Blaine and some Sunday-school songs, until I
                  nearly fiddled my shirt off, and nary time did that guanner bag git up off o' that
                  floor. I knowed it wouldn't. I knowed that feller wa'n't tellin' the truth. But,
                  cap., don't it strike you that a man who'd lie like that ought to have<pb
                     n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6059-00000031"/> somethin' done to him? It 'pears to me 's
                  if a month or two in jail 'd do that feller good."</p>
               <p>The lesson in natural history which I proceeded to give to the judge need not be
                  repeated here. He acknowledged that the laugh was fairly against him, and ended
                  his affirmation of his new-born faith in the integrity of the Atlantic Monthly by
                  inviting me to climb over the fence and taste some of his Bartlett pears. The
                  judge and I have been steady friends ever since.</p>
               <p>I find that one of the most serious objections to living out of town lies in the
                  difficulty experienced in catching the early morning train by which I must reach
                  the city and my business. It is by no means a pleasant matter, under any
                  circumstances, to have one's movements regulated by a timetable and to be obliged
                  to rise to breakfast and to leave home at a certain hour, no matter how strong the
                  temptation to delay may be. But sometimes the horrible punctuality of the train is
                  productive of absolute suffering. For instance: I look at my watch when I get out
                  of bed and find that I have apparently plenty of time, so I dress leisurely, and
                  sit down to the morning meal in a frame of mind which is calm and serene. Just as
                  I crack my first egg I hear the down train from Wilmington. I start in alarm; and
                  taking out my watch, I compare it with the clock and find that it is eleven
                  minutes slow, and that I have only five minutes left in which to get to the
                  dépôt.</p>
               <p>I endeavor to scoop the egg from the shell, but it burns my fingers, the skin is
                  tough, and after struggling with it for a moment, it mashes into a hopeless mess.
                  I drop it in disgust and seize a roll, while I scald my tongue with a quick
                  mouthful of coffee. Then I place the roll in my mouth while my wife hands me my
                  satchel and tells me she thinks she hears the whistle. I plunge madly around
                  looking for my umbrella, then I kiss the family good-bye as well as I can with a
                  mouth full of roll, and dash toward the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Just as I get to the gate, I find that I have forgotten my duster and the bundle
                  my wife wanted me to take up to the city to her aunt. Charging back, I snatch them
                  up and tear down the gravel-walk in a frenzy. I do not like to run through the
                  village: it is undignified and it attracts attention; but I walk furiously. I go
                  faster and faster as I get away from the main street. When half the distance is
                  accomplished, I actually do hear the whistle; there can be no doubt about it this
                  time. I long to run, but I know that if I do I will excite that abominable
                  speckled dog sitting by the sidewalk a little distance ahead of me. <figure/> Then
                  I really see the train coming around the curve close <figure/> by the dépôt, and I
                  feel that I <emph>must</emph> make better time; and I do. The dog immediately
                  manifests an interest in my<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6059-00000032"/> movements. He
                  tears after me, and is speedily joined by five or six other dogs, which frolic
                  about my legs and bark furiously. Sundry small boys, as I go plunging past,
                  contribute to the excitement by whistling with their fingers, and the men who are
                  at work upon the new meeting-house stop to look at me and exchange jocular remarks
                  with each other. I do feel ridiculous; but I must catch that train at all
                  hazards.</p>
               <p>I become desperate when I have to slacken my pace until two or three women who are
                  standing upon the sidewalk, discussing the infamous price of butter, scatter to
                  let me pass. I arrive within a few yards of the station with my duster flying in
                  the wind, with my coat tails in a horizontal position, and with the speckled dog
                  nipping my heels, just as the train begins to move. I put on extra pressure,
                  resolving <figure/> to get the train or perish, and I reach it just as the last
                  car is going by. I seize the hand-rail; I am jerked violently around, but finally,
                  after a desperate effort, I get upon the step with my knees, and am hauled in by
                  the brakeman, hot, dusty and mad, with my trousers torn across the knees, my legs
                  bruised and three ribs of my umbrella broken.</p>
               <p>Just as I reach a comfortable seat in the car, the train stops, and then backs up
                  on the siding, where it remains for half an hour while the engineer repairs a
                  dislocated valve. The anger which burns in my bosom as I reflect upon what now is
                  proved to have been the folly of that race is increased as I look out of the
                  window and observe the speckled dog engaged with his companions in an altercation
                  over a bone. A man who permits his dog to roam about the streets nipping the legs
                  of every one who happens to go at a more rapid gait than a walk, is unfit for
                  association with civilized beings. He ought to be placed on a desert island in
                  mid-ocean, and be compelled to stay there.</p>
               <p>This will do as a picture of the experience of one morning—one melancholy morning.
                  Of course it is exceptional. Rather than endure such agony of mind and discomfort
                  of body frequently, I would move back to the city, and abandon for ever my little
                  paradise by the Delaware.</p>
               <p>I hardly think I shall get along so well with my neighbor on the other side,
                  Cooley, as I do with Pitman. He is not only exceedingly ill-natured, but he
                  inclines to be impertinent. Several times he has volunteered advice respecting the
                  management of my garden and grounds, and has displayed a disposition to be
                  somewhat sarcastic when his plans did not meet with my approval. I contrived,
                  however, to avoid a breach of our amicable relations until the other day, when his
                  conduct became absolutely unendurable.</p>
               <p>I observed in the last number of Ball's <title>Journal of Health</title> some
                  suggestions concerning a good method of exercising the lungs and expanding the
                  chest. They were to this effect:</p>
               <p>"Step out into the purest air you can find; stand perfectly erect,<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000033"/> with the head up and the shoulders back, and then,
                  fixing the lips as though you were going to whistle, draw the air, not through the
                  nostrils, but through the lips, into the lungs. When the chest is about half full,
                  gradually raise the arms, keeping them extended with the palms of the hands down,
                  as you suck in the air, so as to bring them over the head just as the lungs are
                  quite full. Then drop the thumbs inward, and after gently forcing the arms
                  backward and the chest open, reverse the process by which you draw your breath
                  till the lungs are empty. This process should be repeated three or four times
                  immediately after bathing, and also several times through the day."</p>
               <p>This seemed reasonable, and I determined to give it a trial. For that purpose I
                  went out into the yard; and pinning the directions to a tree, I stood in front of
                  them where I could see them. Just as I began, Cooley came out; and perceiving me,
                  he placed his elbows upon the fence, rested his chin upon his arms and watched me
                  with a very peculiar smile upon his face. I was exceedingly annoyed and somewhat
                  embarrassed, but I was determined that he should not have the gratification of
                  driving me away from my own ground. I made up my mind that I would continue the
                  exercise without appearing to notice him. In a few moments, however, he
                  remarked:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Training for a prize-fight, Adeler?"</p>
               <p>I made no reply, but continued the exercise. When I had gone through the programme
                  once, I began again. As I arrived at that portion of it where the instructions
                  direct the arrangement of the lips, Mr. Cooley, by this time somewhat incensed at
                  my silence, observed,</p>
               <p>"Whistle us a tune, Adeler. Give us something lively!"</p>
               <p>As I paid no attention to this invitation, Cooley embraced the opportunity
                  afforded by the upward motion of my arms, in accordance with the directions, to
                  ask me if I was going to dive, and to offer to bring me out a tub in case I
                  cherished such a design.</p>
               <p>Then I completed the exercise and went into the house without giving Cooley any
                  reason to suppose that I was aware of his presence. The next day I performed the
                  ceremony at the same place, at the same hour. On the third day Cooley evidently
                  expected me, for as soon as I appeared he came up to the fence and assumed his old
                  position. He had with him a couple of friends, whom he must have summoned for the
                  express purpose of tormenting me. When I had gone through the movements once,
                  Cooley said:</p>
               <p>"See here, Adeler, I don't want to do you any harm, but let me advise you as a
                  friend to go to an asylum. I have known much worse cases than yours to be cured.
                  It isn't kind to your family for you to remain at large. You're afflicted with
                  only a mild form now; but if you don't do something, you'll have a violent
                  paroxysm some day, and smash things. Now, take my advice, and put yourself under
                  treatment."</p>
               <p>Silence upon my part.</p>
               <p>"How would you take it now," inquired Cooley, in a tone indicative of yearning
                  tenderness, "if I should get over the fence and chain you to the pump while I go
                  for the doctor? I really think you are getting dangerous."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cooley," I said, "I wish you would attend to your own business. I do not wish
                  to quarrel with you, sir, but I will not have any interference on your part with
                  my affairs.<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6059-00000034"/> If it will make you any
                  happier to learn what I am doing, I will tell you, seeing that you are so much
                  interested in the matter, that I am exercising, under medical direction, for the
                  benefit of my lungs."</p>
               <p>"Exercising for the benefit of his lungs!" moaned Cooley. "His mind is entirely
                  gone."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," I said, angrily, "I am exercising for the benefit of my lungs,
                  according to the directions of Dr. Ball, and I will thank you to keep your tongue
                  quiet about it."</p>
               <p>"He has them awfully bad," exclaimed Cooley, with a <figure/> pathetic look.
                  "There is no such man as Dr. Ball, you know," he remarked, in a confidential tone,
                  to one of his companions.</p>
               <p>"I wish you distinctly to understand that I will not tolerate this impertinence
                  much longer, sir," I exclaimed, indignantly. "What right have you to interfere
                  with me upon my own ground, you ruffian?"</p>
               <p>"His intellect's completely shattered," said Cooley, with a mournful shake of his
                  head, to his companions. "Poor Mrs. Adeler! It will be a terrible blow for her and
                  for the children. My heart bleeds for them."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cooley," I said, "I want no more of this. I shall discontinue Dr. Ball's
                  exercise at this place for the present, but I will tell you before I go that I
                  consider you an insolent, unendurable idiot, and I will repay you some day or
                  other for your outrageous behavior to me."</p>
               <p>"Sad, sad, indeed!" said Cooley to his friends. "Strange how he clings to that
                  fancy about a man named Ball, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>One of Cooley's companions observed that the deranged were apt to get such notions
                  in their heads, and he supplemented this statement with the remark, "This is a
                  very interesting case—very."</p>
               <p>Then I went into the house, and from the window saw Cooley and his companions walk
                  away laughing. Not even the unpardonable insolence of Cooley can disguise the fact
                  that the affair has a certain comic aspect; and when I became calmer, I confess
                  that I appreciated this phase of the occurrence with some keenness, even though I
                  happened to occupy an exceedingly unpleasant position as the victim of the joke.
                  But I shall be even with Cooley for this. I will devise a scheme for tormenting
                  him which will cause him to rue the day that he interfered with my pulmonary
                  gymnastics. Dr. Ball's recipe, however, I think I will toss into the fire. I will
                  expand my lungs by learning to sing or to play upon the flute. My family can then
                  participate in my enjoyment. A married man has no right to be selfish in his
                  pleasures.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>MISS BESSIE MAGRUDER is the object upon which the affections of Mr. Bob Parker are
                  fixed at the present moment. He met her, I believe, while she was attending school
                  in the city last winter, and what with accompanying her to matinees, taking her to
                  church and lingering by her side in the parlor oftentimes in the evening with the
                  gas turned low, the heart of Mr. Parker gradually was induced to throb only for
                  the pretty maid from New Castle. She has been very gracious to him during all the
                  time that he has devoted himself to her, and has seemed to like him so well that
                  there is really no reason for doubting that when the climax of the little drama is
                  reached and the question asked, she will droop her eyelids, crimson her cheeks
                  with blushes and whisper "Yes."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. Parker's courage has not yet been quite equal to the presentation of the
                  proposition in a definite form. When I asked him the other day, good-humoredly, if
                  he had explained himself to Miss Magruder, he told me confidentially that he had
                  not. At least a dozen times he had prepared the question in a graceful and
                  effective form, and after committing it to memory he had started out with a
                  valiant determination to declare his passion in that precise language the very
                  moment he should encounter Miss Magruder.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"The words seem all right enough when I'm not with her," sighed Bob. "The very way
                  I wrote 'em out appears to express exactly what I want to say, and as I go along
                  the street I repeat 'em over and think to myself: 'By George, I'll do it now or
                  die!' But as soon as I see her it seems ridiculous to blurt out a speech like that
                  the first thing. So we begin to talk about something else, and then it seems 's if
                  I couldn't break right in abruptly on the conversation. Then I get to wondering
                  how she'd feel if she knew what I was thinking about. Then very likely somebody
                  comes in, and the chance is gone and I have to put it off. It worries me nearly to
                  death. I'll go down there some day soon and plump it right out without saying
                  another word first; I will, by George!"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>It is an odd circumstance that every man who finds himself<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000036"/> self in the position occupied by Mr. Parker should
                  entertain the conviction that he is the first human being who ever suffered such
                  embarrassment. Bob, my dear boy, you are traveling an old, a very old road, and
                  all those rough and stony places whereupon you endure distress, and where your
                  timid feet stumble, have been passed for hundreds of centuries by love-sick
                  wayfarers who were as eager, as unwise and as cowardly as you!</p>
               <p>It is very curious to observe how quickly the partiality of a young man for a maid
                  is perceived by their acquaintances, and with what zest the gossiping tongues tell
                  the tale. Women, of course, display deepest interest and acutest perception in
                  such matters. A movement made in the direction of courtship by a young fellow
                  sends a strong ripple of excitement circling over the surface of the little world
                  in which they live; and there is something wonderful in the rapidity with which
                  the involved questions of suitability, social standing and financial condition are
                  considered and settled. It is soon perceived whether the business is a serious one
                  upon both sides; and as the two chief actors proceed slowly toward the moment when
                  their hearts shall be unfolded to each other, sharp eyes are watching them, and
                  though they think they are keeping their secret very fast from their friends,
                  every step of their progress is perceived, and the gentle excitement of suspense
                  increases and intensifies day by day among the watchers until it culminates in the
                  formal announcement that they are engaged.</p>
               <p>So they remain objects of general and tender consideration until that other grand
                  climax—the wedding—is at last attained; and the bride, with her orange blossoms
                  and her veil, with her satin, her silver-ware and her sweetness, becomes the
                  central figure of a happy festival whose gayety is tempered by the solemn thoughts
                  which will come concerning that great unknown future whose threshold is being
                  passed. And then, when all this is over, when the lights are out, the wedding
                  garments folded away, the practical domestic life begun and the period of romance
                  passed, the interest which followed the pair from the first blossom of their love
                  expires, and, as far as sentiment is concerned, their day—a time full of pleasant
                  things, of grateful happiness in the present and joyful expectation for the
                  future—is done for ever. Thenceforward their lives will be but prosy and dull to
                  the world, however full to them the years may be of serenity and peace.</p>
               <p>I have been making some inquiries concerning the Magruder family, in order to
                  satisfy my wife that Bob's prospective relations are "the right kind of people."
                  The expression, I know, is vague; and now that we have learned something of the
                  Magruders, my inability to determine precisely what qualifications are necessary
                  in order to make people of the right kind of forbids the formation of a definite
                  opinion upon my part concerning them. But Mrs. Adeler will decide; women are
                  always mistresses of such subjects.</p>
               <p>Mr. Magruder is apparently a man of leisure and of comparative wealth; his social
                  position is very good, and he has enough intelligence and cultivation to enable
                  him to get along comfortably in the society of very respectable persons. Mrs.
                  Magruder, it seems, is rather inclined to emphasize herself. She is a physician,
                  an enthusiast in the study and practice of medical science, and a woman of such
                  force that she succeeds in keeping Mr. Magruder, if not precisely in a state of
                  repression, at least slightly in the background. He married her, according to
                  report, shortly after her graduation; and as he was at that time an earnest
                  advocate of the theory that women should practice medicine, a belief prevails that
                  he became attached to her while under her treatment. She touched his heart, we may
                  presume, by exciting activity in his liver. He loved her, let us say, for the
                  blisters she<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6059-00000037"/> had spread, and demanded her
                  hand because he had observed the singular dexterity with which it cut away tumors
                  and tied up veins.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But if what Dr. Tobias Jones, our family physician, tell me is true, the
                  sentiments of Magruder upon the subject of medical women have undergone a radical
                  change in consequence of an exuberance of enthusiasm on the part of Mrs. Magruder.
                  Dr. Jones entertains the regular professional hatred for Mrs. Dr. Magruder, and so
                  I have my private doubts respecting the strict accuracy of his narrative.</p>
               <p>He said that a few years ago the Magruders lived in Philadelphia, and Mrs.
                  Magruder was a professor in the Woman's Medical College. At that time Magruder was
                  in business; and as he generally came home tired, he had a habit of lying on the
                  sitting-room sofa in the evening, for the purpose of taking a nap. Several times
                  when he did so, and Mrs. Magruder had some friends with her down stairs, he
                  noticed upon awaking that there was a <figure/> peculiar feeling of heaviness in
                  his head and a queer smell of drugs in the room. When he questioned Mrs. Magruder
                  about it, she invariably colored and looked confused, and said he must have eaten
                  something which disagreed with him.</p>
               <p>Ultimately the suspicions of Magruder were aroused. He suspected something wrong.
                  A horrible thought crossed his mind that Mrs. Magruder intended to poison him for
                  his <figure/> skeleton—to sacrifice him so that she could dangle his bones on a
                  string before her class, and explain to the seekers after medical truth the
                  peculiarities of construction which enabled the framework of her husband to move
                  around in society.</p>
               <p>So Magruder revealed his suspicions to his brother, and engaged him to secrete
                  himself in a closet in the room while he took his usual nap on a certain evening
                  upon the sofa.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6059-00000038"/>
               <p>When that night arrived, Mrs. Magruder pretended to have the "sewing circle" from
                  the church in the parlor, while her husband went to sleep in the sitting-room with
                  that vigilant relative of his on guard. About nine o'clock Mr. Magruder's brother
                  was surprised to observe Mrs. Magruder softly stealing up stairs, with the members
                  of the "sewing circle" following her noiselessly in single file. In her hand Mrs.
                  Magruder carried a volume. If her brother-in-law had conceived the idea that the
                  book might contain the tender strains of some sweet singer amid whose glowing
                  imagery this woman reveled with the ecstasy of a sensitive nature, he would have
                  been mistaken, for the work was entitled "Thompson on the Nervous System;" while
                  those lines traced in a delicate female hand, upon the perfumed note-paper, and
                  carried by Mrs. Magruder, so far from embodying an expression of the gentlest and
                  most sacred emotions of her bosom, were merely a diagnosis of an aggravated case
                  of fatty degeneration of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I give the story literally as I received it from that eminent practitioner
                  Jones.</p>
               <p>When the whole party had entered the room, Mrs. Magruder closed the door and
                  applied chloroform to her husband's nose. As soon as he became completely
                  insensible, the sewing in the hands of the ladies was quickly laid aside, and to
                  Magruder's secreted brother was disclosed the alarming fact that this was a class
                  of students from the college.</p>
               <p>If Dr. Jones is to be believed, Professor Magruder began her lecture with some
                  very able remarks upon the nervous system; and in order to demonstrate her meaning
                  more plainly, she attached a galvanic battery to her husband's toes, so that she
                  might make him wriggle before the class. And he did wriggle Mrs. Magruder gave him
                  a dozen or two shocks and poked him with a ruler to make him jump around, while
                  the students stood in a semi-circle, with note-books in their hands, and
                  exclaimed, "How very interesting!"</p>
               <p>Magruder's brother thought it awful, but he was afraid to come out when he
                  reflected that they might want <emph>two</emph> skeletons at the college.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Magruder then said that she would pursue this branch of the investigation no
                  further at that moment, because Mr. Magruder's system was somewhat debilitated in
                  consequence of an overdose of chlorate of potash which she had administered in his
                  coffee upon the previous day for the purpose of testing the strength of the
                  drug.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Magruder then proceeded to "quiz" the class concerning the general
                  construction of her husband. She said, for instance, that she had won what was
                  called the heart of Mr. Magruder, and she asked the students what it was that she
                  had really won.</p>
               <p>"Why, the cardia, of course," said the class; "it is an azygous muscle of an
                  irregular pyramid shape, situated obliquely and a little to the left side of the
                  chest, and it rests on the diaphragm."</p>
               <p>One fair young thing said that it didn't rest on the diaphragm.</p>
               <p>Another one said she would bet a quart of paregoric it did, and until the dispute
                  was settled by the professor, Magruder's brother's hair stood on end with fear
                  lest they should go to probing around inside of Magruder with a butcher-knife and
                  a lantern, for the purpose of determining the actual condition of affairs
                  respecting his diaphragm.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Magruder continued. She explained that when she accepted Mr. Magruder he
                  seized her hand, and she required the class to explain what it was that Mr.
                  Magruder actually had hold of.</p>
               <pb n="76-77 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6059-00000039"/>
               <p>The students replied that he held in his grip twenty-seven distinct bones, among
                  which might be mentioned the phalanges, the carpus and the metacarpus.</p>
               <p>The beautiful creature who was incredulous concerning the diaphragm suggested that
                  he also had hold of the deltoid. But the others scornfully suggested that the
                  deltoid was a muscle; they knew, because they had dissected one that very morning.
                  The discussion became so exciting that thumb-lancets were drawn, and there seemed
                  to be a prospect of bloodshed, when the professor interfered and demanded of the
                  girl who had begun to cry about the deltoid what was the result when Mr. Magruder
                  kissed her.</p>
               <p>"Why merely a contraction of the orbicularis oris muscle; thus," said the student
                  as she leaned over and kissed Mr. Magruder.</p>
               <p>Magruder's brother, in the closet, thought maybe it wasn't so very solemn for
                  Magruder after all. He considered this portion of the exercises in a certain sense
                  soothing.</p>
               <p>But all the students said it was perfectly scandalous. And the professor herself,
                  after informing the offender that hereafter when illustration of any point in the
                  lesson was needed it would be supplied by the professor, ordered her to go to the
                  foot of the class, and to learn eighty new bones as a punishment.</p>
               <p>"Do you hear me, miss?" demanded the professor, when she perceived that that
                  blooming contractor of the orbicularis oris did not budge.</p>
               <p>"Yes," she said, "I am conscious of a vibration striking against the membrana
                  tympanum, and being transmitted through the labyrinth until it agitates the
                  auditory nerve, which conveys the impression to the brain."</p>
               <p>"Correct," said the professor. "Then obey me, or I will call my biceps and flexors
                  and scapularis into action and put you in your place by force."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure>
                     <head>"A GENERAL ATTACK ON THE SUBJECT."</head>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6059-00000040"/>
               <p>"Yes, and we will help her with our spinatus and infra-spiralis," exclaimed the
                  rest of the class.</p>
               <p>Magruder's brother in the gloom of his closet did not comprehend the character of
                  these threats, but he had a vague idea that the life of that lovely young
                  saw-bones was menaced by firearms and other engines of war of a peculiarly deadly
                  description. He felt that the punishment was too severe for the crime. Magruder
                  himself, he was convinced, would have regarded that orbicularis operation with
                  courageous fortitude and heroic composure.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Magruder then proceeded to give the class practice in certain operations in
                  medical treatment. She vaccinated Magruder on the left arm, while one of the
                  students bled his right arm and showed her companions how to tie up the vein. They
                  applied leeches to his nose, under the professor's instructions; they cupped him
                  on the shoulder blades; they exercised themselves in spreading mustard plasters on
                  his back; they timed his pulse; they held out his tongue with pincers and examined
                  it with a microscope, and two or three enthusiastic students kept hovering around
                  Magruder's leg with a saw and a carving-knife, until Magruder's brother in
                  retirement in the closet shuddered with apprehension.</p>
               <p>But the professor restrained these devotees of science; and when the other
                  exercises were ended, she informed the students that they would devote a few
                  moments in conclusion to study of the use of the stomach-pump.</p>
               <p>Dr. Jones continued: "I shall not enter into particulars concerning the scene that
                  then ensued. There is a certain want of poetry about the operation of the weapon
                  just named, a certain absence of dignity and sentiment, which, I may say, render
                  it impossible to describe it in a manner which will elevate the soul and touch the
                  moral sensibilities. It will<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6059-00000041"/> suffice to
                  observe that as each member of the class attacked Magruder with that murderous
                  engine, Magruder's brother, timid as he was, solemnly declared to himself that if
                  the class would put away those saws and things he would rush out and rescue his
                  brother at the risk of his life.</p>
               <p>"He was saved the necessity of thus imperiling his safety. Magruder began to
                  revive. He turned over; he sat up; he stared wildly at the company; he looked at
                  his wife; then he sank back upon the sofa and said to her, in a feeble voice:</p>
               <p>"'Henrietta, somehow or other I feel awfully hungry!'</p>
               <p>"Hungry! Magruder's brother considered that, after that <figure/> last performance
                  of the class, Magruder ought to have a relish for a couple of raw buffaloes, at
                  least. He emerged from the closet, and seizing a chair, determined to tell the
                  whole story. Mrs. Magruder and the class screamed, but he proceeded. Then up rose
                  Magruder and discussed the subject with vehemence, while his brother brandished
                  his chair and joined in the chorus. Mrs. Magruder and the class cried, and said
                  Mr. Magruder was a brute, and he had no love for science. But Mr. Magruder said
                  that as for himself, 'hang science!' when a woman became so infatuated with it as
                  to chop up her husband to help it along. And his brother said he ought to put in
                  even stronger terms than that. What followed upon the adjournment of the class is
                  not known. But Magruder seems somehow to have lost much of his interest in
                  medicine, and since then there has been a kind of coolness between him and the
                  professor."</p>
               <p>I shall repeat this extraordinary narrative to Mr. Parker. He ought to be aware of
                  the propensities of his prospective mother-in-law beforehand, so that he may not
                  encounter the dangers which attend her devotion to her profession without
                  realizing the fact of their existence. Admitting that Jones adheres closely to
                  truth in his statement, we may very reasonably fear that Mrs. Magruder would not
                  hesitate to vivisect a mere son-in-law, or in an extreme case to remove one of his
                  legs. A mother-in-law with such dangerous proclivities ought not to be accepted
                  rashly or in haste. Prudence requires that she should be meditated upon.</p>
               <p>"I want to ask you a question," observed Mr. Parker, as we sat out upon the porch
                  after tea with Mrs. Adeler. "I notice that you always say 'is being done,' and not
                  'is doing.' Now, which is correct? I think you're wrong. Some of those big guns
                  who write upon such subjects think so too. Grind us out an opinion."</p>
               <p>"The subject has been much discussed, Bob, and a good many smart things have been
                  said in support of both theories. But I stick to 'is being done,' first, because
                  it is more common, and therefore handier, and second, because it is the only form
                  that is really available in all cases. Suppose, for instance, you wished to
                  express the idea that our boy Agamemnon is enduring chastisement; you would say,
                     'Agamemnon<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6059-00000042"/> non is being spanked,' not
                  'Agamemnon is spanking.' The difference may seem to you very slight, but it would
                  be a matter of considerable importance to Agamemnon; and if a choice should be
                  given him, it is probable that he would suddenly select the latter form."</p>
               <p>"Just so," exclaimed Mr. Parker.</p>
               <p>"You say again, 'Captain Cook is being eaten.' Certainly this expresses a very
                  different fact from that which is conveyed by the form, 'Captain Cook is eating.'
                  I venture to say that Captain Cook would have insisted upon the latter as by far
                  the more agreeable of the two things."</p>
               <p>"Precisely," said Mr. Parker.</p>
               <p>"And equally diverse are the two ideas expressed by the phrases 'The mule is being
                  kicked' and 'The mule is kicking.' But it is to be admitted that there are
                  occasions when the two forms indicate a precisely similar act. You assert, I will
                  say, that 'Hannah is hugging.'"</p>
               <p>"Which would be a very improper thing for Hannah to do," suggested Mr. P.</p>
               <p>"Of course it would; but there is an extreme probability that you would indicate
                  Hannah's action under the circumstances if you should say, 'Hannah is being
                  hugged.' It is in most cases a reciprocal act. Or suppose I say, 'Jane is
                  kissing'?"</p>
               <p>"And her mother ought to know about it if she is," remarked Bob.</p>
               <p>"It is nearly the same as if I should say, 'Jane is being kissed,' for one
                  performance in most cases presupposes the other. It will not, however, be
                  necessary for you to attempt to prove this fact by practice anywhere in the
                  neighborhood of the Magruder mansion. If you find it necessary to explain to Miss
                  Magruder my views of this grammatical question, it will be better to confine your
                  illustrations to the case of Captain Cook. But you can safely continue to say, 'is
                  being built.' Nobody will object to that but a few superfine people who are so far
                  ahead of you in such matters that they will be tolerably sure to regard you as an
                  idiot whichever form you happen to use, while if you adopt the other form in
                  conversation with your unfastidious acquaintances, you will be likely to confuse
                  your meaning very often in such a manner as to impress them with the conviction
                  that your reason is dethroned."</p>

               <p>THE editor of our daily paper, <title>The Morning Argus,</title> is Col.
                  Bangs—Colonel Mortimer J. Bangs. The colonel is an exceedingly important personage
                  in the village, and he bears about him the air of a man who is acutely conscious
                  of the fact. The gait of the colonel, the peculiar way in which he carries his
                  head, the manner in which he swings his cane, and the art he has of impressing any
                  one he happens to address with a feeling that he is performing an act of sublime
                  condescension in permitting himself to hold communication with an inferior being,
                  combine to excite in the vulgar mind a sentiment of awe. The eminent journalist
                  manifests in his entire bearing his confidence in the theory that upon him
                  devolves the responsibility of forming the public opinion of the place; and there
                  is a certain grandeur in the manner in which he conveys to the public mind,
                  through the public eye, the fact that while he appreciates the difficulties of
                  what seemed to be an almost superhuman task, which would surely overwhelm men of
                  smaller intellectual caliber, the work presents itself to his mind as something
                  not much more formidable than pastime.</p>
               <p>The appearance of Colonel Bangs is not only imposing, but sometimes it inclines to
                  be almost ferocious. The form in which he wears his whiskers, added to the
                  military nature of his title, would be likely to give to timid strangers an idea
                  not only that the colonel has a raging and insatiable thirst for blood and an
                  almost irresistible appetite for the horrors of war, but that upon very slight
                  provocation he would suddenly grasp his sword, fling away the scabbard, and then
                  proceed to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on
                  mankind. But I rejoice to say that the colonel has not really such murderous and
                  revolutionary inclinations. His title was obtained in those early years of peace
                  when he led the inoffensive forces of the militia upon parade, and marshaled them
                  as they braved the perils of the target-shooting excursion.</p>
               <p>I think I am warranted in saying that Colonel Bangs would never voluntarily stand
                  in the imminent deadly breach if there happened to be a man there with a gun who
                  wanted him to leave, and that he will never seek the bubble reputation at the
                  cannon's mouth unless the cannon happens to be unloaded. Place Colonel Bangs in
                  front of an empty cannon, and for a proper consideration he would remain there for
                  years without the quiver of a muscle.<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6059-00000044"/>
                  Charge that piece of ordnance with powder and ball, and not all the wealth of the
                  world would induce him to stand anywhere but in the rear of the artillery.</p>

               <p>The <title>Argus</title> has never appeared to me to be an especially brilliant
                  journal. To the intelligent and critical reader, indeed, the controlling purpose
                  of the colonel seems to be to endeavor to ascertain how near he can bring the
                  paper to imbecility without actually reaching that condition; and it is surprising
                  how close a shave he makes of it. When we first came to the village, a gleam of
                  intelligence now and then appeared in the editorial columns of the
                     <title>Argus,</title> and this phenomenon was generally attributed to the
                  circumstance that Colonel Bangs had permitted his assistant editor to spread his
                  views before the public. On such occasions it was entertaining to observe in what
                  manner the colonel would assume the honors of the authorship of his assistant's
                  articles. Cooley, for instance, meeting him upon the street would observe:</p>
               <p>"That was an uncommonly good thing, colonel, which appeared in the
                     <title>Argus</title> this morning on The Impending Struggle; whose was it?"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>COLONEL BANGS (with an air of mingled surprise and indignation). Whose was it?
                  Whose was that article? I suppose you are aware, sir, that <emph>I</emph> am the
                  editor of <title>The Morning Argus!</title>"</p>
               <p>COOLEY. "Yes; but I thought perhaps—"</p>
               <p>COLONEL (with grandeur). "No matter, sir, what you thought. When an article
                  appears in my own paper, Mr. Cooley, there is but a single inference to be drawn.
                  When I find myself unable to edit the <title>Argus,</title> I will sell out, sir—I
                  will sell out!"</p>
               <p>COOLEY (calmly). "Well, but Murphy, your assistant, told me distinctly that he
                  wrote that editorial himself."</p>
               <p>COLONEL (coming down). "Ah! yes, yes! that is partly true, now I remember. I
                  believe Murphy did scratch off the body of the article, but I overhauled it; it
                  was necessary for me to revise it, to touch it up, to throw it into shape, as it
                  were, before it went into type. Murphy means well, and with a little guidance—just
                  a l-e-e-t-l-e careful training—he will do."</p>
               <p>But Murphy did not remain long. One of the colonel's <figure/> little nephews
                  died, and a man who kept a marble-yard in Wilmington thought he might obtain a
                  gratuitous advertisement by giving to the afflicted uncle a substantial expression
                  of his sympathy. So he got up a gravestone for the departed child. The design, cut
                  upon the stone in bas-relief, represented an angel carrying the little one in
                     his<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6059-00000045"/> arms and flying away with it,
                  while a woman sat weeping upon the ground. It was executed in a most dreadful
                  manner. The tombstone was sent to the colonel, with a simple request that he would
                  accept it. As he was absent, Mr. Murphy determined to acknowledge the gift,
                  although he had not the slightest idea what it meant. So the next morning he burst
                  out in the <title>Argus</title> with the following remarks:</p>

                           <p>"We have received from the eminent sculptor, Mr. Felix Mullins of
                              Wilmington, a comic <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bas-relief</foreign>
                              designed for an ornamental fireboard. It represents an Irishman in his
                              night-shirt running away with the little god Cupid, while the
                              Irishman's sweetheart demurely hangs her head in the <figure/> corner.
                              Every true work of art tells its own story; and we understand, as soon
                              as we glance at this, that our Irish friend has been coqueted with by
                              the fair one, and is pretending to transfer his love to other
                              quarters. There is a lurking smile on the Irishman's lips which
                              expresses his mischievous intentions perfectly. We think it would have
                              been better, however, to have clothed him in something else than a
                              night-shirt, and to have smoothed down his hair. We have placed this
                                 <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chef d'œuvre</foreign> upon a shelf in our
                              office, where it will undoubtedly be admired by our friends when they
                              call. We are glad to encourage such progress in Delaware art."</p>

               <p>This was painful. When the colonel returned next day, Mr. Mullins called on him
                  and explained the tombstone to him, and that very night Mr. Murphy retired from
                  the <title>Morning Argus,</title> and began to seek fresh fields for the exercise
                  of his talents.</p>
               <p>Colonel Bangs affords me most entertainment in the <title>Argus</title> when an

               <p>Your city editor often displays a certain amount of vehemence at such times, but
                  his wildest frenzy is calmness, is absolute slumberous repose itself, when
                  compared with the frantic enthusiasm manifested by Colonel Bangs. The latter
                  succeeds in getting up as much fury over a candidate for constable as a city
                  editor does over an aspirant for the Presidency. He will turn out column after
                  column of double-leaded type, in which he will demonstrate with a marvelous
                  profusion of adjectives that if you should roll all the prophets, saints and
                  martyrs into one, you would have a much smaller amount of virtue than can be found
                  in that one humble man who wants to be constable. He will prove to you that unless
                  that particular person is elected, the entire fabric of American institutions will
                  totter to its base and become a bewildering and hopeless ruin, while the merciless
                  despots who grind enslaved millions beneath their iron heels will greet the
                  hideous and irreclaimable chaos with fiendish laughter, and amid the remnants of a
                  once proud republic they will erect bastiles in which they will forge chains to
                  fetter the wrists of dismayed and heart-broken patriots. He will ask you to take
                     your<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6059-00000046"/> choice between electing that man
                  constable and witnessing the annihilation of the proud work for which the
                  Revolutionary patriots bled and died.</p>
               <p>The man who runs against the candidate of the <title>Argus</title> will be proved
                  to be a moral and intellectual wreck, and it will be shown that all the vices
                  which have corrupted the race since the fall of man are concentrated in that one
                  individual. The day after election, if his man wins, Colonel Bangs will decorate
                  his paper with a whole array of roosters and a menagerie of 'coons, and inform a
                  breathless world that the nation is once more saved. If he loses, he will omit any
                  reference to the frightful prophecies uttered during the campaign, keep his
                  roosters in the closet, and mildly assert that the opposition man is not so bad,
                  after all, and that the right party must triumph next time for certain. Then
                  Colonel Bangs will keep his enthusiasm cool for a year, and during that period
                  will rest his overwrought brain, while he edits his paper with a pair of predatory
                  shears and a dishonest paste-pot.</p>
               <p>It is extremely probable that we shall lose our servant-girl. She was the victim
                  of a very singular catastrophe a night or two since, in consequence of which she
                  has acquired a prejudice against the house of Adeler. We were troubled with
                  dampness in our cellar, and in order to remove the difficulty we got a couple of
                  men to come and dig the earth out to the depth of twelve or fifteen inches and
                  fill it in with a cement-and-mortar floor. The material was, of course, very soft,
                  and the workmen laid boards upon the surface, so that access to the furnace and
                  the coal-bin was possible. That night, just after retiring, we heard a woman
                  screaming for help, but after listening at the open window, we concluded that
                  Cooley and his wife were engaged in an altercation, and so we paid no more
                  attention to the noise. Half an hour afterward there was a violent ring at the
                  front-door bell, and upon going to the window again, I found Pitman standing upon
                  the door-step below. When I spoke to him, he said:</p>
               <p>"Max" (the judge is inclined sometimes, especially during periods of excitement,
                  to be unnecessarily familiar), "there's somethin' wrong in your cellar. There's a
                  woman down there screechin' and carryin' on like mad. Sounds 's if somebody's
                  a-murderin' her."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I dressed and descended; and securing the assistance of Pitman, so that I would be
                  better prepared in the event of burglars being discovered, I lighted a lamp and we
                  went into the cellar.</p>
               <p>There we found the maid-servant standing by the refrigerator, knee-deep in the
                  cement, and supporting herself with the handle of a broom, which was also half
                  submerged. In several places about her were air-holes marking the spot where the
                  milk-jug, the cold veal, the lima beans and the silver-plated butter-dish had gone
                  down. We procured some additional boards, and while Pitman seized the sufferer by
                  one arm I grasped the other. It was for some time doubtful if she would come to
                  the surface without the use of more violent means, and I confess that I was half
                  inclined to regard with satisfaction the prospect that we would have to blast her
                  loose with gunpowder. After a desperate struggle, during which the girl declared
                  that she would be torn in pieces, Pitman and I succeeded in <figure/>
                  <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6059-00000047"/>
                  <figure/> getting her safely out, and she went up stairs with half a barrel of
                  cement on each leg, declaring that she would leave the house in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The cold veal is in there yet. Centuries hence some antiquarian will perhaps grub
                  about the spot whereon my cottage once stood, and will blow that cold veal out in
                  a petrified condition, and then present it to a museum as the fossil remains of
                  some unknown animal. Perhaps, too, he will excavate the milk-jug and the
                  butter-dish, and go about lecturing upon them as utensils employed in bygone ages
                  by a race of savages called "the Adelers." I should like to be alive at the time
                  to hear that lecture. And I cannot avoid the thought that <figure/> if our servant
                  had been completely buried in the cement, and thus carefully preserved until the
                  coming of that antiquarian, the lecture would be more interesting, and the girl
                  more useful than she is now. A fossilized domestic servant of the present era
                  would probably astonish the people of the twenty-eighth century.</p>
               <p>"I see," said Mrs. Adeler, who was looking over the evening paper upon the day
                  following the accident, "that Mlle. Willson, the opera-singer, has been robbed of
                  ten thousand dollars' worth of diamonds in St. Louis. What a dreadful loss!"</p>
               <p>"Dreadful, indeed, Mrs. A. These singing women are very unfortunate. They are
                  constantly being robbed, or rolled over embankments in railway cars, or subjected
                  to deadly perils in some other form; and the astonishing thing about it all is
                  that these frightful things invariably occur precisely at the times when public
                  interest in the victims begins to flag a little, and the accounts always appear in
                  the papers of a certain city just before the singers begin an engagement in that
                  place. It is very remarkable."</p>
               <p>"You don't think this story is false, do you, and that all such statements are
                  untrue?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not. I only refer to the fact because it shows how very wonderful
                  coincidences often are. I have observed precisely the same thing in connection
                  with other contributors to popular entertainment. But in these cases some times we
                  may trace the effects directly to the cause. Take menageries, for example. The
                  peculiar manifestations which frequently attend the movements of these collections
                  of wild animals through the land can be attributed only to the wonderful instinct
                  of the beasts. If I am to judge from the reports that appear occasionally in the
                  provincial newspapers, it invariably happens that the animals come to the<pb

               <p>"Regularly every season these ferocious beasts proceed to do something to secure
                  sensational allusions to themselves in the papers. If the rhinoceros does not
                  plunge through the side of the tent and prowl about until he comes home with an
                  entire Sunday-school class of small boys impaled on his horn, the Nubian lion is
                  perfectly certain to bite its keeper in half and lunch upon his legs. If the
                  elephant should neglect to seize his attendant and fling him into the parquet
                  circle, while at the same time it crushes the hyena into jelly, the Bengal tiger
                  is very sure not to forget to tear half a dozen ribs out of the ticket agent, and
                  then to assimilate ten or twelve village children who are trying to peep under the
                  tent. Either the brass band, riding upon the den of lions, finds the roof caving
                  in, and at last is rescued with the loss of the cymbal player and the operator

                  summer season; and whenever I read them, I am at a loss to determine which is more
                  wonderful, the remarkable sagacity and the self-sacrificing devotion of these
                  beasts, which perceive that something must be done and straightway do it, or the
                  childlike confidence, the bland simplicity, of the editors who give gratuitous
                  circulation to these narratives."</p>
               <p>"Talking about menageries," observed Mr. Bob Parker, "did I ever tell you about
                  Wylie and his love affair?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Wylie, you know, was the brother of the porter in our store; and when he had
                  nothing to do, he used to come around and sit in the cellar among the boxes and
                  bales, and we fellows would go down when we were at leisure and hear him relate
                  his adventures.</p>
               <p>"One time, several years ago, he was awfully hard up, and he accepted a situation
                  in a traveling show. They dressed him up in a fur shirt and put grizzly bears'
                  claws on his feet and daubed some stuff over his face, and advertised him as 'The
                  Wild Man of Afghanistan.' Then, when the show was open, he would stand in a cage
                  and scrouge up against the bars and growl until he would scare the children nearly
                  to death. The fat woman used to sit near him during the exhibitions just outside
                  the cage, and by degrees he learned to love her. The keeper of the concern
                  himself, it appears, also cherished a tender feeling for the corpulent young
                  creature, and he became jealous of the Wild Man of Afghanistan."</p>
               <p>"And the professor of avoirdupois—whom did she affect?"</p>
               <p>"Well, when the visitors came, the keeper would procure a pole with a nail in the
                  end, and he would stir up the Wild<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6059-00000049"/> Man
                  and poke him. Then he would ridicule the Wild Man's legs and deliver lectures upon
                  the manner in which he turned in his toes; and he sometimes read to the audience
                  <figure/> chapters out of books of natural history to show that a being with a
                  skull of such a shape must necessarily be an idiot. Then he would poke the Wild
                  Man of Afghanistan a few more times with the pole and pass on to the next cage
                  with some remarks tending to prove that the monkeys therein and the Wild Man were
                  of the same general type.</p>
               <p>"And all the time the fat woman would sit there and smile a cold and disdainful
                  smile, as if she believed it all, and hated such legs and despised toes that
                  turned in. At last the Wild Man of Afghanistan had his revenge. One day when all
                  hands were off duty, the keeper fell asleep on the settee in the ticket-office
                  adjoining the show-room. Then Mr. Wylie threw a blanket over him and went for the
                  fat woman. He led her by the <figure/> hand and asked her to be seated while he
                  told her about his love. Then she suddenly sat down on the keeper."</p>

                  <figure/>

               <p>"Wylie informed me that you could have passed the remains under a closed door
                  without scraping the buttons of the waistcoat. They merely slid him into a crack
                  in the ground when they buried him, and the fat woman pined away until she became
                  thin and valueless. Then the Wild Man married her, and began life again on a new
                  basis."</p>

                  <figure/>

               <p>"Was Mr. Wylie what you might consider a man of veracity?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly he was; and his story is undoubtedly true, because his toes did turn
                  in."</p>
               <p>"That settles the matter. With such incontrovertible evidence as that at hand, it
                  would be folly to doubt the story. We will go quietly and confidently to tea
                  instead of discussing it."</p>

               <p>THE closing hours of the long summer afternoon can be spent in no pleasanter place
                  than by the water's side. And after tea I like to take my little group of Adelers
                  out from the hot streets over the grassy way which leads to the river shore, and
                  to find a comfortable loitering-place upon the Battery. That spot is adorned with
                  a long row of rugged old trees whose trunks are gashed and scarred by the
                  penknives of idlers. Their branches interlock overhead and form one great mass of
                  tender green foliage, here sweeping down almost to the earth, and there hanging
                  far out over the water, trembling and rustling in the breeze. Beneath, there is a
                  succession of hewn logs, suggesting the existence of some sort of a wharf in the
                  remote past, but now serving nicely for seats for those who come here to spend a
                  quiet hour.<pb n="100-101 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6059-00000051"/> Around
                  there is a sod which grows lush and verdant, excepting where the tread of many
                  feet has worn a pathway backward to the village</p>
               <p>In front is as lovely a scene as any the eye can rest upon in this portion of the
                  world. Below us the rising and the ebbing tides hurl the tiny ripples upon the
                  pebbly beach, and the perpetual wash of the waves makes that gentle and constant
                  music which is among the most grateful of the sounds of nature.</p>
               <p>Away to the southward sweeps the Delaware shore line in a mighty curve which gives
                  the river here the breadth and magnificence of a great lake, and at the end of the
                  chord of the arc the steeples and the masts at Delaware City rise in indistinct
                  outline from the waves. To the left, farther in the distance, old Fort Delaware
                  lifts its battlements above the surface of the stream. And see! A puff of white
                  smoke rises close by the flag-staff. And now a dull thud comes with softened
                  cadence across the wide interval. It is the sunset gun. Far, far beyond, a sail
                  glimmers with rosy light caught from the brilliant hues of the clouds which make
                  the western heavens glorious with their crimson drapery; and while here as we gaze
                  straight out through the bay there is naught in the perspective but water and sky,
                  to the right the low-lying land below the island fortress seems, somehow, to be
                  queerly suspended between river and heaven, until as it recedes it grows more and
                  more shadowy, and at last melts away into the mist that creeps in from the ocean.
                  It is pure happiness to sit here beneath the trees and to look upon the scene
                  while the cool air pours in from the water and lifts into the upper atmosphere the
                  oppressive heat that has mantled the earth during the day.</p>
               <p>I do not know why the place is called "the Battery." Perhaps a couple of centuries
                  ago the Swedes may have built here a breastwork with which to menace their hated<figure>

                  Adeler.) And who can tell what strange old Northmen in jerkin and helmet have
                  marched up and down this very stretch of level sward, carrying huge firelock
                  muskets and swearing mighty oaths as they watched the intruding Dutchman in his
                  stronghold, caring little for the placid loveliness of the view which the rolling
                  tide of the majestic river ever offered to their eyes!</p>

               </p>
               <p>But some of those people could appreciate this beautiful panorama. Some of them
                  did not forget the grandeur of nature while their little passions raged against
                  the Dutchmen. It was Jasper Dankers who came here from Sweden in 1676, and looked
                  out from this Battery; returning home, he wrote in his diary in this fashion:</p>
               <p>"The town is situated upon a point which extends out with a sandy beach, affording
                  a good landing-place. It lies a little above the bay where the river bends and
                  runs south from there, so that you can see down the river southwardly. The greater
                  portion of it presents a beautiful view in perspective, and enables you to see
                  from a distance the ships come out from the great bay and sail up the river."</p>
               <p>The sandy beach is gone, and the ships which float upward from the bay are not
                  such craft as Dankers saw; but the stream has its ancient majesty, and the wooded
                  banks, I like to think, present to our eyes nearly the same sweet picture that
                  touched the soul of that old Swede two long centuries ago.</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6059-00000053"/>
               <p>Another thing has changed—yes, it has changed many times. The Indians, Mrs. A.,
                  called the bay Poutaxat and the river Lenape Wihittuck. The stream, too, was named
                  the Arasapha, and also Mackerish Kitton—a title pretty enough in its way, but
                  oddly suggestive of mackerel and kittens. But the Swedes came, and with that
                  passion which burned in the bosoms of all the early European immigrants for
                  prefixing the word "new" to the names of natural objects, they entitled the river
                  New Swedeland Stream. Then the Dutch obtained the mastery here, and it became the
                  South River, the Hudson being the North River, and finally the English obtained
                  possession, and called it Delaware.</p>
               <p>What a pity it is that they didn't suffer one of the original titles to remain!
                  The Lenape would have been a beautiful name for the river—far better than the
                  Gallic compound that it bears now. The men who settled this country seem to have
                  had for Indian names the same intense dislike that they entertained for the
                  savages themselves, and as a rule they rejected with scorn the soft, sweet
                  syllables with which mountain and forest and stream were crowned, substituting too
                  often most barbarous words therefor. Even Penn and his Quakers disdained the
                  Indian names. How much better Pennsylvania would have been treated if that grand
                  old State had been called Susquehanna or Juniata or Allegheny! And would it not
                  have been wiser if the city, instead of bringing its name from Asia, had sought it
                  among its own surroundings, and had grown to greatness as Wissahickon or
                  Wingohocking? The Indian names that still remain here and there to designate a
                  stream, a district or a town are the few distinctly American words in existence.
                  We have thrown away the others, although they were a very precious part of the
                  legacy which we received from the race we have supplanted. One such word as
                  Wyoming is worth an entire volume of such names as New York, Philadelphia,
                  Baltimore, Maryland and the like; and I have always wondered at the blundering
                  folly of the man who, with such musical syllables at hand ready to be used, dubbed
                  the town of Wilkes Barre with that particularly poor name.</p>
               <p>While we were sitting by the river discussing these and other matters, Cooley's
                  boy, a thoroughly disagreeable urchin, who had been playing with some other boys
                  upon the wharf near by, tumbled into the water. There was a terrible screaming
                  among his companions, and a crowd quickly gathered upon the pier. For a few
                  moments it seemed as if the boy would drown, for no one was disposed to leap in
                  after him, and there was not a boat within saving distance. But fortunately the
                  current swept him around to the front of the Battery, where the water is shallow,
                  and before he was seriously hurt he was safely landed in the mud that stretches
                  below the low-water mark. Then the excitement, which had been so great as to
                  attract about half the population of the village, died away, and people who had
                  just been filled with horror at the prospect of a tragedy began to feel a sense of
                  disappointment because their fears had not been realized. I cannot of course say
                  that I was sorry to see the youngster once more upon dry land; but if fate had
                  robbed us of him, we should have accepted the dispensation without grievous
                  complaint.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We did not leave all the nuisances behind us in the city. Cooley's dog and his boy
                  are two very sore afflictions which make life even here very much sadder than it
                  ought to be in a place that pretends to be something in the nature of an<pb
                     n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6059-00000054"/> earthly paradise. The boy not only
                  preys upon my melonpatch and fruit trees and upon those of my neighbors, but he
                  has an extraordinary aptitude for creating a disturbance in whatever spot he
                  happens to be. Only last Sunday he caused such a terrible commotion in church that
                  the services had to be suspended for several minutes until he could be removed.
                  The interior of the edifice was painted and varnished recently, and I suppose one
                  of the workmen must have left a clot of varnish upon the back of Cooley's pew,
                  which is directly across the aisle from mine. Cooley's boy was the only
                  representative of the family at church upon that day, and he amused himself during
                  the earlier portions of the service by kneeling upon the seat and communing with
                  Dr. Jones's boy, who occupied the pew immediately in the rear. Sometimes, when
                  young Cooley would resume a proper position, Jones's boy would stir him up afresh
                  by slyly pulling his hair, whereupon Cooley would wheel about and menace Jones
                  with his fist in a manner which betrayed utter indifference to the proprieties of
                  the place and the occasion, as well as to the presence of the congregation. When
                  Cooley finally sank into a condition of repose, he placed his head, most
                  unfortunately, directly against the lump of undried varnish, while he amused
                  himself by reading the commandments and the other scriptural texts upon the wall
                  behind the pulpit.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>In a few moments he attempted to move, but the varnish had mingled with his hair,
                  and it held him securely. After making one or two desperate but ineffectual
                  efforts to release himself, he became very angry; and supposing that Jones's boy
                  was holding him, he shouted:</p>
               <p>"Leg go o' my hair! Leg go o' my hair, I tell you!"</p>
               <p>The clergyman paused just as he was entering upon consideration of "secondly," and
                  the congregation looked around in amazement, in time to perceive young Cooley,
                  with his head against the back of the pew, aiming dreadful blows <figure/> over
                  his shoulder with his fist at some unseen person behind him. And with every thrust
                  he exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I'll smash yer nose after church! I'll go for you, Bill Jones, when I ketch you
                  alone! Leg go o' my hair, I tell you, or I'll knock the stuffin' out o' yer,"
                  etc., etc.</p>

               <p>Meanwhile, Jones's boy sat up at the very end of his pew, far away from Cooley,
                  and looked as solemn as if the sermon had made a deep impression upon him. Then
                  the sexton came running up, with the idea that the boy had fallen asleep and had
                  nightmare, while Mrs. Dr. Magruder sallied out from her pew and over to Cooley's,
                  convinced that he had a fit. When the cause of the disturbance<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000055"/> ance was ascertained, the sexton took out his
                  knife, and after sawing off enough of Cooley's hair to release him, dragged him
                  out of church. The victim retreated unwillingly, <figure/> glancing around at
                  Jones's boy and shaking his fist at that urchin as if to indicate that he
                  cherished a deadly purpose against Jones.</p>
               <p>Then the sermon proceeded. I suppose a contest between the two boys has been
                  averted, for only yesterday I saw Jones and Cooley, the younger, playing
                  hop-scotch together in the street in apparent forgetfulness of the sorrows of the
                  sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Judge Pitman tells me that one of the reasons why Cooley and his wife disagree is
                  that there is such a difference in their height. Cooley is tall, and Mrs. Cooley
                  is small. Mrs. Cooley told Mrs. Pitman, if the judge is to be believed, that
                  Cooley continually growled because she could not keep step with him. They always
                  start wrong, somehow, when they go out together, and then, while he tries to catch
                  step with her, she endeavors to get in with him. After both have been shuffling
                  about over the pavement for several minutes in a perfectly absurd manner, they go
                  ahead out of step just as before.</p>
               <p>When Cooley tried to take short steps like hers, his gait was so ridiculous as to
                  excite remark; while if she tried to make such long strides as his, people stopped
                  and looked at her as if they thought she was insane. Then she would strive to take
                  two steps to his one, but she found that two and a half of hers were equal to one
                  of his; and when she undertook to make that fractional number in order to keep up
                  with him, he would frown at her and say,</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Cooley, if you are going to dance the polka mazourka upon the public
                  highway, I'm going home."</p>
               <p>I do not receive this statement with implicit confidence in its truthfulness.
                  Pitman's imagination sometimes glows with unnatural heat, and he may have
                  embellished the original narrative of Mrs. Cooley.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I shall probably never receive from any member of the Cooley family a correct
                  account of the causes of the unpleasant<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6059-00000056"/>
                  pleasant differences existing therein, for we are on worse terms than ever with
                  Cooley. His dog became such an intolerable nuisance because of his nocturnal
                  vociferation that some practical humanitarian in the neighborhood poisoned him.
                  <figure/> Cooley apparently cherished the conviction that I had killed the animal,
                  and he flung the carcass over the fence into my yard. I threw it back. Cooley
                  returned it. Both of us remained at home that day, and spent the morning handing
                  the inanimate brute to each other across the fence. At noon <figure/> I called my
                  man to take my place, and Cooley hired a colored person to relieve him. They kept
                  it up until night-fall, by which time I suppose the corpse must have worn away to
                  a great extent, for at sundown my man buried the tail by my rose-bush and came in
                  the house, while Cooley's representative resigned and went home.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The departed brute left behind him but one pleasant recollection; and when I
                  recall it, I feel that he fully avenged my wrongs upon his master. Cooley went out
                  a week or two ago to swim in the creek, and he took the dog with him to watch his
                  clothing. While Cooley bathed the dog slept; but when Cooley emerged from the
                  water, the dog did not recognize him in his nude condition, and it refused to let
                  him come near his garments. Whenever Cooley would attempt to seize a boot or a
                  stocking or a shirt, <figure/> the dog flew at him with such ferocity that he
                  dared not attempt to dress himself. So he stood in the sun until he was almost
                  broiled; then he went into the water and remained there, dodging up and down for
                  the purpose of avoiding the people who passed occasionally along the road. At last
                  the dog went to sleep again, and Cooley, creeping softly behind the<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000057"/> brute, caught it suddenly by the tail and flung it
                  across the stream. Before the dog could recover its senses and swim back, Cooley
                  succeeded in getting some of his clothing on him, and then the dog came sidling up
                  to him looking as if it expected to be rewarded for its extraordinary vigilance.
                  The manner in which Cooley kicked the faithful animal is said to have been simply
                  dreadful.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I should have entertained a positive affection for that dog if it had not barked
                  at night. But I am glad it is gone. We came here to have quietness, and that was
                  unattainable while Cooley's dog remained within view of the moon.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>A RATHER unusual sensation has been excited in the village by the <title>Morning
                     Argus</title> within a day or two; and while most of the readers of that
                  wonderful sheet have thus been supplied with amusement, the soul of the editor has
                  been filled with gloom and wrath and despair. Colonel Bangs recently determined to
                  engage an assistant to take the place made vacant by the retirement of the eminent
                  art-critic, Mr. Murphy, and he found in one of the lower counties of the State a
                  person who appeared to him to be suitable. The name of the new man is Slimmer. He
                  has often contributed to the <title>Argus</title> verses of a distressing
                  character, and I suppose Bangs must have become acquainted with him through the
                  medium of the correspondence thus begun. No one in the<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000058"/> world but Bangs would ever have selected such a
                  poet for an editorial position. But Bangs is singular—he is exceptional. He never
                  operates in accordance with any known laws, and he is more than likely to do any
                  given thing in such a fashion as no other person could possibly have adopted for
                  the purpose. As the <title>Argus</title> is also <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sui
                     generis,</foreign> perhaps Bangs does right to conduct it in a peculiar manner.
                  But he made a mistake when he employed Mr. Slimmer.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The colonel, in his own small way, is tolerably shrewd. He had observed the
                  disposition of persons who have been bereaved of their relatives to give
                  expression to their feelings in verse, and it occurred to him that it might be
                  profitable to use Slimmer's poetical talent in such a way as to make the
                     <title>Argus</title> a very popular vehicle for the conveyance to the public of
                  notices of deaths. That kind of intelligence, he well knew, is especially
                  interesting to a very large class of readers, and he believed that if he could
                  offer to each advertiser a gratuitous verse to accompany the obituary paragraph,
                  the <title>Argus</title> would not only attract advertisements of that description
                  from the country round about the village, but it would secure a much larger
                  circulation.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Slimmer arrived, therefore, and entered upon the performance of his
                  duties, Colonel Bangs explained his theory to the poet, and suggested that
                  whenever a death-notice reached the office, he should immediately write a rhyme or
                  two which should express the sentiments most suitable to the occasion.</p>
               <p>"You understand, Mr. Slimmer," said the colonel, "that when the death of an
                  individual is announced I want you, as it were, to cheer the members of the
                  afflicted family with the resources of your noble art. I wish you to throw
                  yourself, you may say, into their situation, and to give them, f'r instance, a few
                  lines about the deceased which will seem to be the expression of the emotion which
                  agitates the breasts of the bereaved."</p>
               <p>"To lighten the gloom in a certain sense," said Mr. Slimmer, "and to—"</p>
               <p>"Precisely," exclaimed Colonel Bangs. "Lighten the <figure/> gloom. Do not mourn
                  over the departed, but rather take a joyous view of death, which, after all, Mr.
                  Slimmer, is, as it were, but the entrance to a better life. Therefore, I wish you
                  to touch the heart-strings of the afflicted with a tender hand, and to endeavor,
                  f'r instance, to divert their minds from contemplation of the horrors of the
                  tomb."</p>
               <p>"Refrain from despondency, I suppose, and lift their thoughts to—"</p>
               <p>"Just so! And at the same time combine elevating sentiment with such practical
                  information as you can obtain<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6059-00000059"/> from the
                  advertisement. Throw a glamour of poesy, f'r instance, over the commonplace
                  details of the every-day life of the deceased. People are fond of minute
                  descriptions. Some facts useful for this purpose may be obtained from the man who
                  brings the notice to the office; others you may perhaps be able to supply from
                  your imagination."</p>
               <p>"I think I can do it first rate," said Mr. Slimmer.</p>
               <p>"But, above all," continued the colonel, "try always to take a bright view of the
                  matter. Cause the sunshine of smiles, as it were, to burst through the tempest of
                  tears; and if we don't make the <title>Morning Argus</title> hum around this town,
                  it will be queer."</p>
               <p>Mr. Slimmer had charge of the editorial department the next day during the absence
                  of Colonel Bangs in Wilmington. Throughout the afternoon and evening death-notices
                  arrived; and when one would reach Mr. Slimmer's desk, he would lock the door,
                  place the fingers of his left hand among his hair and agonize until he succeeded
                  in completing a verse that seemed to him to accord with his instructions.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning Mr. Slimmer proceeded calmly to the office for the purpose of
                  embalming in sympathetic verse the memories of other departed ones. As he came
                  near to the establishment he observed a crowd of people in front of it, struggling
                  to get into the door. Ascending some steps upon the other side of the street, he
                  overlooked the crowd, and could see within the office the clerks selling papers as
                  fast as they could handle them, while the mob pushed and yelled in frantic efforts
                  to obtain copies, the presses in the cellar meanwhile clanging furiously. Standing
                  upon the curbstone in front of the office there was a long row of men, each of
                  whom was engaged in reading <title>The Morning Argus</title> with an <figure/>
                  earnestness that Mr. Slimmer had never before seen displayed by the patrons of
                  that sheet. The bard concluded that either his poetry had touched a sympathetic
                  chord in the popular heart, or that an appalling disaster had occurred in some
                  quarter of the globe.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>He went around to the back of the office and ascended to the editorial rooms. As
                  he approached the sanctum, loud voices were heard within. Mr. Slimmer determined
                  to ascertain the cause before entering. He obtained a chair, and placing it by the
                  side door, he mounted and peeped over the door through the transom. There sat
                  Colonel Bangs, holding <title>The Morning Argus</title> in both hands, while the
                  fringe which grew in a semicircle around the edge of his bald head stood straight
                  out, until he seemed to resemble a gigantic gun-swab. Two or three persons stood
                  in front of him in threatening attitudes. Slimmer heard one of them say:</p>
               <p>"My name is McGlue, sir!—William McGlue! I am a brother of the late Alexander
                  McGlue. I picked up your paper this morning, and perceived in it an outrageous

               <p>"This is simply diabolical! My late brother had no wart on his nose, sir. He had

                  family, and I distinctly want you to say <emph>what do you mean</emph> by such
                  conduct?"</p>
               <p>"Really, sir," said Bangs, "it is a mistake. This is the horrible work of a

               <p>"How could I know, "murmured Mr. Slimmer to the foreman, who with him was
                  listening, "that the corpse hadn't a pink wart? I used to know a man named McGlue,
                  and <emph>he</emph> had one, and I thought <emph>all</emph> the McGlues had. This
                  comes of irregularities in families."</p>
               <p>"And who," said another man, addressing the editor, "authorized you to print this

               <p>"The atrocious character of this libel will appear when I say that my son was
                  twenty years old, and that he died of liver complaint."</p>
               <p>"Infamous!—utterly infamous!" groaned the editor as he cast his eyes over the
                  lines. "And the wretch who did this still remains unpunished! It is too much!"</p>
               <p>"And yet," whispered Slimmer to the foreman, "he told me to lighten the gloom and
                  to cheer the afflicted family<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6059-00000061"/> with the
                  resources of my art; and I certainly thought that idea about the monkey would have
                  that effect, somehow. Bangs is ungrateful!"</p>
               <p>Just then there was a knock at the door, and a woman entered, crying.</p>
               <p>"Are you the editor?" she inquired of Colonel Bangs.</p>
               <p>Bangs said he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"W-w-well!" she said, in a voice broken by sobs, "wh-what d'you mean by publishing
                  this kind of poetry about m-my child? M-my name is Sm-Smith; and wh-when I looked
                  this m-morning for the notice of Johnny's d-death in your paper, I saw this
                  scandalous verse: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Four doctors tackled Johnny Smith—</l>

                        <l>With squills and anti-bilious pills</l>

               <p>"It's false! false! and mean! Johnny only had <emph>one</emph> doctor. And they
                  d-didn't bl-bleed him and b-blister him. It's a wicked falsehood, and you're a
                  hard-hearted brute f-f-for printing it!"</p>
               <p>"Madam, I shall go crazy!" exclaimed Bangs. "This is not my work. It is the work
                  of a villain whom I will slay with my own hand as soon as he comes in. Madam, the
                  miserable outcast shall die!"</p>
               <p>"Strange! strange!" said Slimmer. "And this man told me to combine elevating
                  sentiment with practical information. If the information concerning the squills
                  and ipecac. is not practical, I have misunderstood the use of that word. And if
                  young Smith didn't have four doctors, it was an outrage. He ought to have had
                  them, and they ought to have excited his liver. Thus it is that human life is
                  sacrificed to carelessness."</p>
               <p>At this juncture the sheriff entered, his brow clothed with thunder. He had a copy
                  of <title>The Morning Argus</title> in his hand. He approached the editor, and
                  pointing to a death-notice, said,</p>
               <p>"Read that outrageous burlesque, and tell me the name of the writer, so that I can
                  chastise him."</p>
               <p>The editor read as follows: <q>

               <p>As the sheriff went out, Colonel Bangs placed his head upon the table and
                  groaned.</p>
               <p>"Really," Mr. Slimmer said, "that person must be deranged. I tried, in his case,
                  to put myself in his place, and to write as if I was one of the family, according
                  to instructions. The verses are beautiful. That allusion to the grief of the aunt,
                  particularly, seemed to me to be very happy. It expresses violent emotion with a
                  felicitous combination of sweetness and force. These people have no soul—no
                  appreciation of the beautiful in art."</p>
               <p>While the poet mused, hurried steps were heard upon the stairs, and in a moment a
                  middle-aged man dashed in <figure/> abruptly, and seizing the colonel's scattered
                  hair, bumped his prostrate head against the table three or four times with
                  considerable force. Having expended the violence of his emotion in this manner, he
                  held the editor's head down with one hand, shaking it occasionally by way of
                  emphasis, and with the other hand seized the paper and said,</p>
               <p>"You disgraceful old reprobate! You disgusting vampire! You hoary-headed old
                  ghoul! What d'you mean by putting such stuff as this in your paper about my

               <p>At the end of every phrase the visitor gave the editor's head a fresh knock
                  against the table. When the exercise was ended, Colonel Bangs explained and
                  apologized in the humblest manner, promising at the same time to give his
                  assailant a chance to flog Mr. Slimmer, who was expected to arrive in a few
                  moments.</p>
               <p>"The treachery of this man," murmured the poet to the foreman, "is dreadful.
                  Didn't he desire me to throw a glamour of poesy over commonplace details? But for
                  that I should never have thought of alluding to woodpeckers and bugs, and other
                  children of Nature. The man objects to the remarks about the sled. Can the idiot
                  know that it was necessary to have a rhyme for 'bed'? Can he suppose that<pb

                  The man is a lunatic! He ought not to be at large!"</p>
               <p>Hardly had the indignant and energetic parent of Bartholomew departed when a man
                  with red hair and a ferocious glare in his eyes entered, carrying a club and
                  accompanied by a savage-looking dog.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"I want to see the editor," he shouted.</p>
               <p>A ghastly pallor overspread the colonel's face, and he said,</p>
               <p>"The editor is not in."</p>
               <p>"Well, when <emph>will</emph> he be in, then?"</p>
               <p>"Not for a week—for a month—for a year—for ever! He will never come in any more!"
                  screamed Bangs. "He has gone to South America, with the intention to remain there
                  during the rest of his life. He has departed. He has fled. If you want to see him,
                  you had better follow him to the equator. He will be glad to see you. I would
                  advise you, as a friend, to take the next boat—to start at once."</p>
               <p>"That is unfortunate," said the man; "I came all the way from Delaware City for
                  the purpose of battering him up a lot with this club."</p>
               <p>"He will be sorry," said Bangs, sarcastically. "He will regret missing you. I will
                  write to him, and mention that you dropped in.</p>
               <p>"My name is McFadden," said the man. "I came to break the head of the man who
                  wrote that obituary poetry about my wife. If you don't tell me who perpetrated the

               <p>"The man who held the late Mrs. McFadden up to the scorn of an unsympathetic world
                  in that shocking manner," said the editor, "is named James B. Slimmer. He boards
                  in Blank street, fourth door from the corner. I would advise you to call on him
                  and avenge Mrs. McFadden's wrongs with an intermixture of club and dog-bites."</p>
               <p>"And this," sighed the poet, outside the door, "is the man who told me to divert
                  McFadden's mind from contemplation of the horrors of the tomb. It was this monster
                  who counseled me to make the sunshine of McFadden's smiles burst through the
                  tempest of McFadden's tears. If that redheaded monster couldn't smile over that
                  allusion to whisky and rum, if those remarks about the rheumatism in her legs
                  could not divert his mind from the horrors of the tomb, was it <emph>my</emph>
                  fault? McFadden grovels! He knows no more about poetry than a mule knows about the
                  Shorter Catechism."</p>
               <p>The poet determined to leave before any more criticisms were made upon his
                  performances. He jumped down from his chair and crept softly toward the back
                  staircase.</p>
               <p>The story told by the foreman relates that Colonel Bangs at the same instant
                  resolved to escape any further persecution, and he moved off in the direction
                  taken by the poet. The two met upon the landing, and the colonel was about<pb
                     n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6059-00000064"/> to begin his quarrel with Slimmer, when
                  an enraged old woman who had been groping her way up stairs suddenly plunged her
                  umbrella at Bangs, and held him in the corner while she handed a copy of the
                     <title>Argus</title> to Slimmer, and pointing to a certain stanza, asked him to
                  read it aloud. He did so in a somewhat tremulous voice and with frightened glances
                  at the enraged colonel. The verse was as follows: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

               </p>
               <p>The colonel's assailant accompanied the recitation with such energetic remarks as
                  these:</p>
               <p>"Oh, you willin! D'you hear that, you wretch? What d'you mean by writin' of my
                  grandson in that way? Take that, you serpint! Oh, you wiper, you! tryin' to break
                  a lone widder's heart with such scand'lus lies as them! There, you willin! I

                  anyhow, you wile wretch, you!"</p>
               <p>When Mr. Slimmer had concluded his portion of the entertainment, he left the
                  colonel in the hands of the enemy and fled. He has not been seen in New Castle
                  since that day, and it is supposed that he has returned to Sussex county for the
                  purpose of continuing in private his dalliance with the Muses. Colonel Bangs
                  appears to have abandoned the idea of establishing a department of obituary
                  poetry, and the <title>Argus</title> has resumed its accustomed aspect of
                  dreariness.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>It may fairly boast, however, that once during its career it has produced a
                  profound impression upon the community.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bob Parker came home at a very late hour last night; and when I opened the
                  front door to let him in, he muttered something to the effect that he was "sorry
                  for being out so late." Then he pushed by me suddenly and went up stairs<pb
                     n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6059-00000065"/> in a very odd fashion, keeping his face
                  as much as possible toward the door, where I remained standing, astonished at his
                  very strange behavior. When I closed the door and went to my room, it occurred to
                  me that something of a serious nature might have happened; and impelled partly by
                  curiosity and partly by a desire to be of service, I knocked at Bob's door.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Anything the matter?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"Oh no. I was detained down town," replied Bob.</p>
               <p>"I can't do anything for you, then?"</p>
               <p>"No; I'll be in bed in a couple of minutes."</p>
               <p>"You acted so peculiarly when you came in that I thought you might be ill."</p>
               <p>"I was never better in my life. I went up stairs that way because I was
                  tired."</p>
               <p>"A very extraordinary effect of fatigue," I said.</p>
               <p>"I say!" cried Bob, "don't say anything to your wife about it. There's no use of
                  getting up an excitement about nothing."</p>
               <p>I went to bed convinced that something was wrong, and determined to compel Bob to
                  confess on the morrow what it was. After breakfast we sat smoking together on the
                  porch, and then I remarked:</p>
               <p>"Bob, I wish you to tell me plainly what you meant by that extraordinary caper on
                  the stairs last night. I think I ought to know. I don't want to meddle with your
                  private affairs, but it seems to me only the proper thing for you to give me a
                  chance to advise you if you are in trouble of any kind. And then you know I am
                  occupying just now a sort of a parental relation to you, and I want to overhaul
                  you if you have been doing anything wrong."</p>
               <p>"I don't mind explaining the matter to you," replied Bob. "It don't amount to
                  much, anyhow, but it's a little rough on a fellow, and I'd rather not have the
                  whole town discussing it."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"You know old Magruder's? Well, I went around there last night to see Bessie; and
                  as it was a pleasant evening, we thought we would remain out on the porch. She sat
                  in a chair near the edge, and I placed myself at her feet on one of the low wooden
                  steps in front. We stayed there talking about various things and having a pretty
                  fair time, as a matter of course, until about nine o'clock, when I said I thought
                  I'd have to go."</p>
               <p>"You came home later, I think."</p>
               <p>"Well, you know, some mutton-headed carpenter had been there during the day
                  mending the rustic chairs on the porch, and he must have put his glue-pot down on
                  the spot where I sat, for when I tried to rise I found I couldn't budge."</p>
               <p>"You and Cooley's boy seem to have a fondness for that particular kind of
                  adventure."</p>
               <p>"Just so. And when I made an effort to get upon my feet, Bessie said, 'Don't be in
                  a hurry; it's early yet,' and I told her I believed I would stay a little while
                  longer. So I sat there for about two hours, and during the frightful gaps in the
                  conversation I busied myself thinking how I could get away without appearing
                  ridiculous. It hurts a man's chances if he makes himself ridiculous before a woman
                  he is fond of. So you see I didn't know whether to ask Bessie to go in the house
                  while I partially disrobed and went home in<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000066"/> Highland costume, or whether to give one terrific
                  wrench and then proceed down the yard backward. I couldn't make up my mind; and as
                  midnight approached, Bessie, who was dreadfully sleepy, said, at last, in utter
                  despair, she would have to excuse herself for the rest of the evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Then, you understand, I was nearly frantic, and I asked her suddenly if she
                  thought her father would lend me <figure/> his front steps for a few days. She
                  looked sort of scared. and went in after old Magruder. When he came out, I made
                  him stoop down while I explained the situation to him. He laughed and hunted up a
                  hatchet and saw, and cut away the surrounding timber, so that I came home with
                  only about a square foot of wood on my trousers. Very good of the old man, wasn't
                  it, to smash up his steps in that manner? And the reason why I kind of sidled up
                  stairs was that I feared you'd see that wooden patch and want to know about it.
                  That's all. Queer sort of an affair, wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. Parker darted off for the purpose of overtaking Miss Magruder, who at
                  that moment happened to pass upon the other side of the street.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Parker disappeared, Mrs. Adeler came out upon the porch from the hall, and
                  placing her hand upon my shoulder, said,</p>
               <p>"You are not going to publish that story of the attempt of the
                     <title>Argus</title> to establish a department of obituary poetry, are
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I am. Why shouldn't I?"</p>
               <p>"Don't you fear it might perhaps give offence? There are some people, you know,
                  who think it right to accompany a notice of death with verses. Besides, does it
                  seem precisely proper to treat such a solemn subject as death with so much
                  levity?"</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6059-00000067"/>
               <p>"My dear, the persons who use those ridiculous rhymes which sometimes appear in
                  the papers for the purpose of <figure/> parading their grief before the public
                  cannot have very nice sensibilities."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure of that? At any rate, is it not possible that a verse which appears
                  to you and me very silly may be the attempt of some bereaved mother to give in
                  that forlorn fashion expression to her great agony? I shouldn't like to ridicule
                  even so wretched a cry from a suffering heart."</p>
               <p>"The suggestion is creditable to your goodness. But I would like to retain the
                  story of Slimmer's folly, and I'll tell you what I will do: I will publish your
                  opinions upon the subject, so that those who read the narrative may understand
                  that the family of Adeler is not wholly careless of propriety." So here are the
                  story and the protest; and those to whom the former is offensive may find what
                  consolation can be obtained from the fact that the latter has been offered in
                  advance of any expression of opinion by indignant readers whose grief for the
                  departed tends to run into rhyme.</p>

               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>IT is probable that I should never have bought a horse if I had not been strongly
                  urged to do so by other persons. I do not care a great deal for riding and
                  driving; and if it ever did occur to me that it would, perhaps, be a nice thing to
                  have a horse of my own, I regarded the necessary expense as much too great for the
                  small amount of enjoyment that could be obtained from the investment. It always
                  seemed to me to be much cheaper to hire a horse at a livery-stable if only an
                  occasional drive was desired; and I cling to that theory yet. But everybody else
                  seemed to think I ought to own a horse. Mrs. Adeler was especially anxious about
                  it. She insisted that we were doing very well in the world, and she could not see
                  the use of having means if we were to live always as we did when we were poor. She
                  said she often wanted to take a little drive along the river-road in the evening
                  with the children, and she frequently wished to visit her friends in the country,
                  but she couldn't bear to go with a strange horse of which she knew nothing.</p>
               <p>My friends used to say, "Adeler, I wonder you don't keep a horse and take your
                  family out sometimes;" and they hammered away at the theme until I actually began
                  to feel as if the public suspected me of being a niggardly and cruel tyrant, who
                  hugged my gold to my bosom and gloated over the misery of my wife and
                  children—gloated because they couldn't have a horse. People used to come down from
                  the city to see us, and after examining the house and garden, they would remark,
                  "Very charming!—very charming, indeed! A little paradise, in fact; but, Adeler,
                  why don't you buy a horse?"</p>
               <p>I gradually grew nervous upon the subject, and was tolerably well convinced that
                  there would never be perfect happiness in my family until I purchased a steed of
                  some kind. At last, one day Cooley had a yellow horse knocked down to him at one
                  of those auction-sales which are known in the rural districts as
                  "V<emph>an</emph>dues." And when I saw Cooley drive past the house, every
                  afternoon, with that saffron brute, and his family in a dearborn wagon, and
                  observed how he looked in at us and smiled superciliously, as if he was thinking,
                  "There lives a miserable outcast who has no horse and can't get one," I determined
                  to purchase at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I have not had much experience with horses, but I found one whose appearance and
                  gait were fairly good, and I was<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6059-00000069"/>
                  particularly drawn toward him because the man recommended him as being "urbane." I
                  had heard many descriptions of the points of a good horse, but this was the first
                  time I had ever met a horse whose most prominent characteristic was urbanity. It
                  seemed to me that the quality was an excellent one, and I made a bargain on the
                  spot and drove home.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Adeler," I said, as I exhibited the purchase to her, "I do not think this
                  horse is very fast; I do not regard him as in the highest sense beautiful; he may
                  even be deficient in wind; his tail certainly is short; and I think I can detect
                  <figure/> in his forelegs a tendency to spring too far forward at the knees; but,
                  Mrs. Adeler, the horse is urbane. The man said that his urbanity amounted to a
                  positive weakness, and that is why I bought him. If a horse is not urbane, my
                  dear, it is useless, no matter what its merit in other respects."</p>
               <p>She said that had been her opinion from early childhood.</p>
               <p>"I do not care greatly, Mrs. Adeler, for excessive speed. Give me a horse that can
                  proceed with merely a tolerable degree of celerity and I am content. I never could
                  comprehend why a man whose horse can trot a mile in two minutes and forty seconds
                  should be made unhappy because another man's horse trots the same distance one
                  second sooner—that is, of course, supposing that they are not running for money.
                  One second of time never makes any especial difference to me, even when I am in a
                  hurry. What I want in a horse is not swiftness, but urbanity. I would rather have
                  a kindhearted horse, like ours, than the most rapid trotter with a wicked
                  disposition."</p>
               <p>For a while I enjoyed having a horse, and I felt glad I had bought him. It seemed
                  very good to drive down by the river-bank upon a pleasant evening, with the cool
                  breeze blowing in from the water, and the country around beautiful with the bright
                  foliage of early autumn. There was a sufficient compensation for the heat and
                  wretchedness of the busy day in that quiet journey over the level road and past
                  the fragrant fields in the early twilight; and as we came home amid the deepening
                  shadows, we could find pleasure in watching the schooners far off in the channel
                  flinging out their lights, and we could see the rays streaming across the wide
                  interval of rippling surface, and moving weirdly and strangely with the motion of
                  the water.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, upon going out, we would overtake Cooley in his dearborn; and then it
                  was felicitous to observe how, when I touched my horse with the whip, the animal
                  put his head down, elevated his abbreviated tail to a horizontal position and left
                  Cooley far, far behind, flogging his tawny horse with such fury as would surely
                  have subjected him to the reproaches of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
                  to Animals if that excellent organization had been present. My horse could achieve
                  a tolerably rapid gait when he desired<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6059-00000070"/>
                  sired to do so. That fact made existence in this world of anguish and tears seem
                  even more sad to Cooley than it had done previously. I feel sure that he would
                  have given fabulous sums if his horse could have trotted a mile in a minute
                  <figure/> —just once—when we were upon the road together. I began to think that it
                  was just as well, after all, to have a progressive horse as a slow one.</p>
               <p>But when the novelty of the thing had passed, my old indisposition to amusement of
                  that kind gradually returned. I drove less frequently. One day my man said to
                  me:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adeler, that hoss is a-eatin' his head off, sir. If you don't take him out,
                  he'll be so wild that he'll bu'st the machine to flinders, sir."</p>
               <p>The threatened catastrophe seemed so alarming that I took him out, although I had
                  important work to do at home. The next day I wanted to stay up in the city to go
                  to a lecture; but that morning, early, the horse again displayed an alarming
                  amount of friskiness, and I felt as if I must go down and exercise him. I drove
                  him for three hours at a rapid gait, and succeeded in working off at least the
                  exuberance of his spirits.</p>
               <p>On the following Wednesday I came home in the afternoon noon, exhausted with work,
                  and intending to retire at an early hour. At half-past six o'clock, Judge Pitman
                  came in. He remarked:</p>
               <p>"Adeler, that horse of yourn 'll certainly go crazy if you don't move him around.
                  Mind me. He kicks like a flintlock musket now if you come within forty foot of the
                  stable."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I went out and hitched up, and that night I drove twenty-four miles at a frightful
                  speed. Horses have, perhaps, gone farther and faster, but few have been pushed
                  forward with a smaller regard for consequences. Nothing but a recollection of the
                  cost of the horse restrained me from driving him into the river and leaving him
                  there.</p>
               <p>By degrees the despicable brute became the curse of my existence. If I desired to
                  go on a journey, the restlessness of the horse had first to be overcome. If I
                  received an invitation to a party, the horse must be exercised beforehand. If I
                  had an important article to write, I must roam around the country behind that
                  horse for two or three hours, holding him in with such force that my hands were
                  made too unsteady for penmanship. If I wanted to take a row on the river—an
                  exercise of which I am passionately fond—that detestable animal had to be danced
                  up and down the turnpike in order to keep him from kicking the stable to pieces.
                  And he was recommended to me as "urbane"!</p>
               <p>He made my life unhappy. I became depressed and morose. Sometimes when, amid a
                  circle of friends, there was a provocation to laughter, and I participated in the
                  general hilarity, I would suddenly become conscious of the fact that the horse was
                  in active existence, and the mirth would be extinguished in gloom. He mingled with
                  my dreams. Visions of a bob-tailed horse consuming spectral oats, and kicking with
                  millions of legs, disturbed my rest at night. I<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000071"/> rushed with him over countless leagues of shadowy
                  road, and plunged with him over incomprehensible precipices. He organized himself
                  into hideous nightmare shapes, and <figure/> charged wildly over me as I slept,
                  and filled all the air of that mysterious slumber-land with the noise of his
                  demoniac neighing.</p>
               <p>The reality was bad enough without the unreal nocturnal horrors. I might have sold
                  the brute, but my wife really wanted to have a horse, and I wished to oblige her.
                  But it was very wearing to bear about constantly the feeling of responsibility
                  which the animal engendered. I had to choose between driving him continually and
                  having the lives of the members of my family imperiled when they took him out; and
                  the consciousness that whether there was sickness or business, storm or
                  earthquake, calamity or death, the horse must be driven, gradually placed me in
                  the position of a man who is haunted by some dreadful spectre that clings to him
                  and overshadows him for ever and for ever.</p>
               <p>The perpetual nervous worry told upon me. I became thin. My clothing hung loose
                  upon me. I took up two inches in my waistcoat strap. The appetite which enabled me
                  to find enjoyment at the table deserted me. The food seemed tasteless; and if in
                  the midst of a meal the neigh of the horse came eddying up through the air from
                  the stable, I turned away with a feeling of disgust, and felt as if I wanted to
                  prod somebody with the carving-knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>One day my wife said to me:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adeler, you know that I urged you strongly to buy that horse, and I thought
                  he would do, but—"</p>
               <p>"But now you want to sell him! ha! ha!" I exclaimed, with delight. "Very well,
                  I'll send him to the auctioneer this very day."</p>
               <p>"I wasn't going to say that," she remarked. "What I wanted to mention was that
                  nearly everybody in good circumstances about here drives a pair, and I think we
                  ought to get another horse; don't you, my dear? It's so much nicer than having
                  only one."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Adeler," I said, solemnly, "that one horse down there in the stable has
                  reduced me to a skeleton and made me utterly miserable. I will do as you say if
                  you insist upon it, but I tell you plainly that if another horse is brought upon
                  these premises I shall go mad."</p>
               <p>"Don't speak in that manner, my dear."</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Mrs. Adeler, that I shall go stark, staring mad! Take your choice: go
                  without the other horse or have a maniac husband."</p>
               <p>She said, of course, she would do without the horse.</p>
               <p>But the affliction was suddenly and unexpectedly removed<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000072"/> My horse had a singularly brief tail, and I thought
                  it might be that some of his violent demonstrations in the stable were induced by
                  his inability to switch off the flies which alighted upon sensitive portions of
                  the body. It occurred to me to get him up an artificial tail for home use, and I
                  procured a piece of thick rope for the purpose. There was, too, a certain
                  humorousness about the idea that pleased me; and as the amount of jocularity which
                  that horse had occasioned had, thus far, been particularly small, the notion had
                  peculiar attractiveness.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I unraveled about eighteen inches of the rope and fastened the other end to the
                  horse's tail. This, I estimated. would enable him to switch a fly off the very end
                  of his nose when he had acquired a little practice. Unfortunately, I neglected to
                  speak to my man upon the subject; and when he came to the stable that evening, he
                  examined the rope and concluded that I was trying experiments with some new kind
                  of hitching-strap; so he tied the horse to the stall by the artificial
                  continuation. By morning the feedbox was kicked into kindling-wood, and the horse
                  was standing<figure/> ing on three legs, with the other leg caught in the
                  hay-rack, while he had chewed up two of the best boards in the side of the stable
                  in front of him.</p>
               <p>Subsequently I explained the theory to the man and readjusted the rope. But the
                  patent tail annoyed the hostler so much while currying the horse that he tied a
                  stone to it to hold it still. The consequence was that in a moment of unusual
                  excitement the horse flung the stone around and inflicted a severe wound upon the
                  man's head. The man resigned next morning.</p>
               <p>I then concluded to introduce an improvement. I purchased some horse-hair and
                  spliced it upon the tail so neatly that it had the appearance of a natural growth.
                  When the new man came, he attempted to comb out the horse's tail, and the added
                  portion came off in his hand. He had profound confidence in his veterinary skill,
                  and he imagined that the occurrence indicated a diseased condition of the horse.
                  So he purchased some powders and gave the animal an enormous dose in a bucket of
                  warm "mash." In half an hour that pestilential horse was seized with convulsions,
                  during which he kicked out the stable-door, shattered the stall to pieces,
                  hammered four more boards out of the partition, dislocated his off hind leg and
                  expired in frightful agony.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He was more urbane after death than he had been during his life, and I
                  contemplated his remains without shedding a tear. He was sold to a glue-man for
                  eight dollars; and when he had departed, I felt that he would fulfill a wiser and
                     better<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6059-00000073"/> purpose as a contributor to
                  the national stock of glue than as the unconscious persecutor of his former
                  owner.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Adeler, do you feel any interest in the subject of pirates?"</p>
               <p>She said the question was somewhat abrupt, but she thought she might safely say
                  she did not.</p>
               <p>"I make the inquiry for the reason that I have just written a ballad which has for
                  its hero a certain bold corsair. This is the first consequence of the death of our
                  horse. In the exuberance of joy caused by that catastrophe, I felt as if I would
                  like to perpetrate something which should be purely ridiculous, and accordingly I
                  organized upon paper this piratical narrative. You think the subject is an odd
                  one? Not so. I do not pretend to explain the fact, but it is true that by this
                  generation a pirate is regarded as a comic personage. Perhaps the reason is that
                  he has been so often presented to us in such a perfectly absurd form in melodrama
                  and in the cheap and trashy novels of the day. At any rate, he is susceptible of
                  humorous treatment, as you will perceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"I have had a stronger impulse to write of buccaneers, too, because I am in New
                  Castle; for, somehow, I always associate those freebooting individuals with this
                  village. A certain ancestor of mine sailed away from this town in 1813, in a brig
                  commissioned as a privateer, and played havoc with the ships of the enemy upon the
                  Atlantic. In my childhood I used to hear of his brave deeds, and, somehow, I
                  conceived the idea that he was a genuine pirate with a black flag, skull and
                  cross-bones, and a disagreeable habit of compelling his captives to walk the
                  plank. I was much more proud of him then, Mrs. Adeler, than I should be now had he
                  really been such a ruffian. But he was not. He was a gallant sailor and a brave
                  and honest gentleman, who served his country faithfully on the ocean, and then
                  held a post of honor as warden of the port of Philadelphia until his death. But I
                  never go to the river's side in New Castle without involuntarily recalling that
                  fine old man in the character of an outlawed rover upon the high seas.</p>
               <p>"Here, my dear, is the ballad. When I have read it to you, I will send it to the
                     <title>Argus.</title> Since Mr. Slimmer's retirement there has been a dearth of

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>THERE are but few old villages in the United States that contain ancient churches
                  so picturesque in situation and in appearance as that which stands in the centre
                  of our town, the most conspicuous of its buildings. The churchyard is filled with
                  graves, for the people still cling to that kindly usage which places the sacred
                  dust of the departed in holy ground. And so here, beneath the trees, and close to
                  the shadow of the sanctuary walls, villagers of all ages and generations lie
                  reposing in their final slumber, while from among them the snow-white spire rises
                  heavenward to point the way their souls have gone. There are many of us who were
                  not born here, and who are, as it were, almost strangers in the town, who can
                  wander down the narrow paths of the yard, to out-of-the-way corners, where the
                  headstones are gray with age and sometimes covered with a film of moss, and read
                  in the quaint characters with which the marble is inscribed our own family names.
                  Here lies the mortal part of men and women who were dear to our grandsires; of
                  little children too, sometimes, whose departure brought sorrow to the hearts of
                  those who joined them in Paradise long, long before we began to play our parts in
                  the drama of existence. The lives that ended in this quiet resting-place are full
                  of deepest interest to us; they have a controlling influence upon our destiny, and
                  yet they are very unreal to us. The figures which move by us as we try to summon
                  up the panorama of that past are indistinct and obscure. They are shadows walking
                  in the dusk, and we strive in vain to vest them with a semblance of the
                  personality which once was theirs. They should seem very near to us their kindred,
                  and yet, as we attempt to come closer to them, they appear so remote, so far away
                  in the dead years, that we hardly dare to claim fellowship with them, or to speak
                  of them as of our flesh and blood.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>It makes no difference where the empty shell is cast when the spiritual man is
                  gone, but I reverence that human instinct which induces a man to wish to be laid
                  at the last by the side of his ancestors and near to those whom he has loved in
                  life. It is at least a beautiful sentiment which demands that those who are with
                  each other in immortality should not be separated here on earth, but together
                  should await the morning of the resurrection.</p>
               <p>I like this old church for its simplicity; not only for the absence of splendor in
                  its adornment, but for the methods of worship of which it approves. The choir,
                  from its station<pb n="154-155 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6059-00000078"/> in the
                  organ-loft, never hurls down upon the heads of the saints and sinners beneath any
                  of those surprising sounds which rural choirs so often emit, with a conviction
                  that they are achieving wonderful feats of vocalism, and no profane fingers compel
                  the pipes of the microscopic organ to recall to the mind of the listener the music
                  of the stage and the concert-room. From the instrument come only harmonies round,
                  sweet and full, melting in solemn cadences from key to key and rolling down
                  through the church, bringing the souls of the worshipers into full accord with the
                  spirit of the place and the occasion, or else pouring forth some stately melody on
                  which the voices of the singers are upborne. The choir fulfills its highest
                  purpose by leading the people through the measures of those grand old tunes,
                  simple in construction but sublime in spirit, which give to the language of the
                  spiritual songs of the sanctuary a more eloquent beauty than their own. I would
                  rather hear such music as may be found in "Federal Street," in "Old Hundred," in
                  "Hursley" and in the "Adeste Fideles," sung by an entire assembly of people who
                  are in earnest in their religion, than to listen to the most intricate fugue
                  worked out by a city choir of hired singers, or the most brilliant anthem sung by
                  a congregation of surpliced boys who quarrel with each other and play wicked games
                  during the prayers. Such tunes as these are filled with solemn meaning which is
                  revealed to him whose singing is really an act of worship. There is more genuine
                  religious fervor in "Hursley" than in a library of ordinary oratorios. A <figure/>

                  <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6059-00000079"/> church which permits its choir to do
                  all the singing might as well adopt the Chinese fashion of employing a machine to
                  do its praying. A congregation which sits still while a quartette of vocalists
                  overhead utters all the praises, need not hesitate to offer its supplications by
                  turning a brass wheel with a crank. Our people do their singing and their praying
                  for themselves, and the choir merely takes care that the music is of a fitting
                  kind.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Miss Magruder sits in the organ-loft now that she is at home, and I doubt not she
                  contributes much to the sweetness of the strains which float from out that
                  somewhat narrow enclosure. Her presence, I observe, ensures the regular attendance
                  of young Mr. Parker at the church, and last Sunday he even ventured to sit with
                  the choir and to help with the singing. I have never considered him a really good
                  performer, although he cherishes a conviction that he has an admirable voice, and
                  such acquaintance with the art of using it as would have given him eminence if he
                  had chosen the career of a public singer. After service I had occasion to speak to
                  the clergyman for a moment, and as soon as he saw me he said:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adeler, did you notice anything about the organ or the choir to-day that was
                  peculiar?"</p>
               <p>"No; I do not think I did."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"It is very odd; but it seemed to me when they were singing the two last hymns
                  that something must be the matter with one of the pipes. There was a sort of a
                  rough, buzzing, rasping sound which I have never observed before. The instrument
                  must need repairing."</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6059-00000080"/>
               <p>"I think I know what it was," remarked Mr. Campbell, the basso, who stepped up at
                  that moment.</p>
               <p>"The valves a little worn, I suppose?" said the minister.</p>
               <p>"Well, no," replied Campbell; "the fact is that extraordinary noise was produced
                  by Mr. Parker, who was making a strenuous effort to sing bass. He seemed to be
                  laboring under a strong conviction that the composers had made some mistakes in
                  the tunes, which he proposed to correct as he went along. Parker's singing is like
                  homœopathic medicine—a very little of it is enough."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Bob attributes the criticism of Campbell to professional jealousy, but he will
                  probably sit down stairs after this. He prefers not to waste his talents upon
                  provincial people who cannot appreciate genuine art. He will content himself with
                  walking home with the fair Magruder after service.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>There is one thing about the church with which I must find fault. I have never
                  been able to comprehend why it is customary throughout this country, even in the
                  large cities, to permit undertakers to decorate the exteriors of churches with
                  their advertisements, as ours is decorated by our undertaker. In old times, when
                  the sexton was the grave-digger and general public functionary, it was well enough
                  to give publicity to his residence by posting its whereabouts in a public place.
                  There were oftentimes little offices which he had to perform for the congregation
                  and for the neighborhood, and it was necessary that he should be found quickly.
                  But the present fashion, which allows an undertaker—who has no other connection
                  with the church than that he sits in a pew occasionally and goes to sleep during
                  the sermon—to nail a tin sign, bearing a picture of a gilt coffin, right by the
                  church door, so that no man, woman or child can enter that sanctuary without
                  thinking of the grave, is monstrous.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>It is very proper that the minds of the people should be turned to contemplation
                  of the certainty of death whenever they go to church. But it is hardly necessary
                  to disturb a man's reflections upon the necessity of preparing for the grave by
                  confronting him with an advertisement which compels him to remember how much it is
                  going to cost his relations to put him there. Besides this, it makes the
                  undertakers covetous, and fills their gloomy souls with murderous wishes.</p>
               <p>I have seen ours standing against the wall in the churchyard on a Sunday morning
                  with his hands in his pockets, glowering at the congregation as they go in, eyeing
                  and criticising the members, and muttering to himself, "Splendid fit
                     <emph>he'd</emph> make in that mahogany coffin I've got at home!" "There goes a
                  man who ought to have died five years ago if <emph>I'd</emph> been treated right!"
                  "I'll souse that Thompson underground<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6059-00000081"/>
                  derground some of these fine days!" "Those Mulligan girls <emph>certainly</emph>
                  can't give the old man anything less than a four-hundred-dollar funeral when
                     <emph>he</emph> dies!" "Healthiest looking congregation of its size <emph>I
                     ever</emph> saw!" etc., etc.</p>
               <p>If I were in authority in the church, I would suppress that gilded advertisement
                  and try to convert the owner of it. <figure/> No man should be permitted to waste
                  his Sabbaths in vain longings for the interment of his fellow-men.</p>
               <p>They are very busy now at the church putting in new furnaces in order to be
                  prepared for the cold weather. New ones were introduced last winter, I am told,
                  but they were not entirely successful in operation. The first time the fire was
                  put in them was on Saturday morning, and on Sunday the smoke was so dense in the
                  church that nobody could see the clergyman. The workman had put the stove-pipe
                  into the hot-air flue. Next Saturday night the fires were lighted, but on Sunday
                  morning only the air immediately under the roof was warm, and the congregation
                  nearly froze to death. The sexton was then instructed to make the fire on
                  Thursday, in order to give the church a chance to become thoroughly heated. He did
                  so, and early Sunday morning the furnaces were so choked up with ashes that the
                  fires went out, and again the thermometer in the front pew marked zero.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Then the sexton received orders to make that fire on Thursday, and to watch it
                  carefully until church-time on the following Sabbath. He did so, and both furnaces
                  were in full blast at the appointed hour. That was the only warm Sunday we had
                  last winter. The mercury was up to eighty degrees out of doors, while in the
                  church everybody was in a profuse perspiration, and the bellows-blower at the
                  organ fainted twice. The next Sunday the sexton tried to keep the fires low by
                  pushing in the dampers, and consequently the church was filled with coal-gas, and
                  the choir couldn't <figure/>
                  <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6059-00000082"/> sing, nor could the minister preach
                  without coughing between his sentences.</p>
               <p>Subsequently the sexton removed one of the cast-iron registers in the floor for
                  the purpose of examining the hot-air flue. He left the hole open while he went
                  into the cellar for a moment, and just then old Mr. Collamer came in to hunt for
                  his gloves, which he thought he had left in his pew. Of course he walked directly
                  into the opening, and was dragged out in a condition of asphyxia. That very day
                  one of the furnaces burst and nearly fired the church. The demand for heaters of
                  another kind seemed to be imperative.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Old Collamer, by the way, is singularly unfortunate in his experiences in the
                  sanctuary. He is extremely deaf, and a few Sundays ago he made a fearful blunder
                  during the sermon. The clergyman had occasion to introduce a quotation, and as it
                  was quite long, he brought the volume with him; and when the time came, he picked
                  up the book and began to read from it. We always sing the Old Hundred doxology
                  after sermon at our church, and Mr. Collamer, seeing the pastor with the book,
                  thought the time had come, so while the minister was reading he opened his
                  hymn-book at the place. Just as the clergyman laid the volume down the man sitting
                  next to Mr. Collamer began to yawn, and Mr. Collamer, thinking he was about to
                  sing, immediately broke out into Old Hundred, and roared it at the top of his
                  voice. As the clergyman was just beginning "secondly," and as <figure/> there was
                  of course perfect silence in the church, the effect of Mr. Collamer's vociferation
                  was very startling. But the good old man failed to notice that anything was the
                  matter, so he kept right on and sang the verse through.</p>
               <p>When he had finished, he observed that everybody else seemed to be quiet,
                  excepting a few who were laughing, so he leaned over and said out loud to the man
                  who yawned,</p>
               <p>"What's the matter with this congregation, anyhow? Why don't they go home?"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The man turned scarlet, and the perspiration broke out all over him, for he felt
                  that the eyes of the congregation were upon him, and he knew that he would have to
                  yell to make Mr. Collamer hear. So he touched his lips with his fingers as a sign
                  for the old man to keep quiet. But Mr. Collamer misunderstood the motion:</p>
               <p>"Goin' to sing another hymn, hey? All right."</p>
               <p>And he began to fumble his hymn-book again. Then the sexton hurried up the aisle,
                  and explained matters out loud to Mr. Collamer, and that gentleman subsided, while
                  the minister proceeded with his discourse. The clergyman has written Mr. Collamer
                  a note requesting him in the future not to join in the sacred harmony. The effect
                  is too appalling upon the ribald boys in the back pews.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>IT is said that there is good fishing in this vicinity. Several of my neighbors
                  who have been out lately have brought home large quantities of fish of various
                  kinds, together with glowing reports of the delightful character of the sport. A
                  craving to indulge in this form of amusement was gradually excited in the mind of
                  Mr. Bob Parker by the stories of the anglers and by the display of their trophies,
                  and he succeeded in persuading me to assist in the organization of an expedition
                  down the river to the fishing-grounds. Yesterday was selected for the undertaking.
                  I hired a boat from a man at the wharf; and after packing a generous luncheon in
                  the fish-basket and securing a box full of bait, <figure/> we tossed our lines
                  into the boat, together with a heavy stone which was to serve as an anchor, and
                  then we pushed out into the stream.</p>
               <p>It was early morning when we started, and to my dismay I found that the tide was
                  running up with remarkable <figure/> velocity. As we had to pull four miles down
                  the river, this was a consideration of very great importance. Mr. Parker is not an
                  especially skillful oarsman, and before he had fairly seated himself and dipped
                  his blade in the water we had drifted two hundred yards in the wrong direction.
                  After very severe labor for half an hour, we succeeded in getting three-quarters
                  of a mile below the town, and then Bob informed me that he thought he could row
                  better with my oar. Accordingly, I changed places with him, and during the time
                  thus expended the boat went back a third of the distance we had gained. Another
                  prolonged and terrible effort enabled us to proceed two miles toward our
                  destination, and then Parker observed that he must stop and rest; he said he would
                  die if he rowed another stroke. So we lay upon our oars for a while, and embraced
                  the opportunity to wipe away the perspiration and to cool our blistered hands in
                  the river. Parker then asked me if I would mind changing places with him again. He
                  said he was now convinced that <figure/>
                  <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6059-00000084"/> he had made a mistake in leaving his
                  first position. We fell back half a mile during this period; and when we finally
                  reached the grounds, the morning was far advanced. Bob was nearly worn out, and he
                  proposed that we give up the idea of catching fish and row ashore, where we could
                  lie down under the trees and begin operations upon the luncheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But as we had come to fish. I was determined to do so. I informed Bob that I
                  should be ashamed to go home without bringing any game. I should be afraid to look
                  in the face of the man who owned the boat when he asked me what luck I had. So we
                  tied a rope around the stone, and tossing the stone overboard, we came to anchor.
                  Our hooks were baited and the lines were thrown out, and then Bob and I waited
                  patiently for bites.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>It required a great deal of patience, for the fish did not take the bait with a
                  remarkable degree of freedom. In fact, we only had a nibble or two at first, and
                  then even this manifestation of the presence of the fish ceased. We were sitting
                  with our backs to the shore, watching the corks in front of us, when Bob suddenly
                  uttered an exclamation. Upon looking around, I found that we had drifted half a
                  mile up stream and out into the middle of the river, which <figure/> is here
                  nearly four miles wide. The stone had dropped from the knot in the rope and
                  released the boat.</p>
               <p>Then we rowed back to shore and landed for the purpose of obtaining another stone.
                  We could not find one, so we pulled out again; and sticking one of the oars in the
                  mud, we fastened the boat to that. Then Bob had a bite. He pulled up, and dragged
                  to the surface of the water a crab, which instantly let go and sidled under the
                  boat. Then we each caught a small sunfish, and with this our enthusiasm began to
                  revive. Just then the oar came out of the mud, slipped through the loop in the
                  cable and floated off. The prospect of having to take the boat home with one oar
                  seemed so appalling that I hastily threw off my coat and shoes and swam after the
                  fugitive oar. Meantime, the boat floated off, and I reached it and was hauled in
                  by Bob just as I had made up my mind to give up and go to the bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>We then fastened the oar down again, and I held it with one hand and my
                  fishing-line with the other. Suddenly each of us had a splendid bite, and we both
                  pulled in vigorously. The fish seemed to struggle violently all the way to the
                  surface; but when the hooks came into view, we found that our lines were
                  entangled, and that neither of us had a<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6059-00000085"/>
                  fish. The next time Bob attempted to take in his line his hook caught upon the
                  bottom; and when, in a fit of exasperation, he tried to jerk it loose, the cord
                  snapped and the hopes of the fisherman were blasted for that day. Then, as Bob
                  tipped the boat while he washed his hands, the bait-box fell overboard, and so
                  matters came to a definite conclusion, and we determined to quit.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>When we started for home, the tide had turned, and we did not reach town until
                  dark. The man who owned the craft had just telegraphed to Delaware City for the
                  purpose of ascertaining if two suspicious men had landed there and attempted to
                  sell a boat. He compelled me to pay half a day's hire extra for staying out so
                  late, together with the cost of the telegram.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I consider it beneath me to notice the unnecessary violence of his language or the
                  insolence of his criticisms upon our skill as fishermen.</p>
               <p>This I could have borne with patience, but it was hard, very, very hard, upon
                  arriving home, to have Mrs. Adeler come to the door with a smile upon her face and
                  ask, "Where are the fish?" while she informed us that she had asked the Magruders
                  over to tea, and had depended upon us to supply the principal dish, so that now
                  she had not a thing in the house that she could cook.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Adeler, we return with two diminutive sunfish, one demoralized ham-sandwich,
                  two crimson noses and a thorough, sincere, whole-souled and earnest disgust for
                  the wretched business which some men choose to regard in the light of amusement.
                  No, Mrs. Adeler, we have no fish that are worthy of the name, and hereafter when
                  we wish to have some, we will purchase them from the unhappy beings who catch
                  them. A fisherman deserves all the money he can get, my dear. I wouldn't be a
                  professional piscator for the mines of Golconda and the wealth of a nabob to
                  boot."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Our unfortunate experiences upon the river tempt me to refer in detail to the ills
                  to which amateur fishermen, as a class, are exposed. The pleasures of angling have
                  been said and sung by a vast multitude of sentimental people reaching all the way
                  from old Izaak Walton to Mr. Prime; but the story of the suffering that too often
                  accompanies the sport has not yet been narrated with a sufficient amount of vigor.
                  The martyr fishermen have been too long kept in the background. The time has come
                  for them to have a hearing. I have chosen to present their complaint in the
                  somewhat singular form of a letter to Mr. Benjamin F. Butler, because at the time
                  of the negotiation of the Washington treaty he manifested much indignation at the
                  wrongs heaped upon American fishermen by that instrument, and because he is a very
                  suitable person to figure in a remonstrance which has about it perhaps a slight
                  flavor of burlesque, even though it is a narrative of real misery.</p>

                  <head>THE SORROWS OF THE FISHERMAN.</head>
                  <p>DEAR GENERAL: I have given a great deal of reflection, lately, to the fishery
                     question, and I am convinced that your opposition to the fishery clauses of the
                     Washington treaty had a basis of sound common sense. The treaty, in my opinion,
                     wholly fails to consider in a spirit of wise statesmanship the causes which
                     move the fisherman to complaint, and supplies no adequate means for securing
                     their removal. Permit me to suggest to you the propriety of urging upon the
                     government the reassembling of the joint high commission for the purpose of
                     obtaining a reconsideration of the fishery question with the new light which I
                     propose to shed upon it.</p>
                  <p>My experience in fishing has convinced me that one of the most serious of the
                     primary obstacles to be overcome is the difficulty of procuring worms. Perhaps
                     you may have observed an enthusiastic fisherman in pursuit of worms? The day is
                     always warm, and his performance upon the shovel conduces to profuse
                     perspiration. He seems never to strike precisely the spot where the worms
                     frolic. He labors with tremendous energy until he has excavated a couple of
                     cellars and a rifle-pit, from which he rescues but two or three worms, while
                     all around him the earth is perforated with holes, into which other vermicular
                     creatures are perceived to disappear before he can lay his hands on them. The
                     alacrity with which a worm draws himself into a hole in the ground, and dives
                     down apparently to the centre of the globe, when you want him, is a constant
                     source of aggravation to the fisherman. The fishery interests suffer on account
                     of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a joint high commission would address itself in a conciliatory spirit to the
                     work of obtaining concerted action from the civilized nations of the world upon
                     the subject of the reformation of worms, blessed results would undoubtedly
                     accrue. I know a fisherman who could make a speech in Congress on the subject
                     of worms which would make that body weep the rotunda full of tears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And even when bait has been secured, you are aware, perhaps, that the fisherman
                     will sit for hours upon the bank of the stream watching his cork until he is
                     nearly blinded, and until his head swims. At last, when his patience is
                     exhausted and he is convinced that there are no fish about, he pulls up for the
                     purpose of trying another spot, and finds that some disreputable fish has
                     sucked the bait off the hook an hour before without making a perceptible
                     nibble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps a clause in the treaty upon the general subject of nibbles might be of
                     service. I think a paragraph could be constructed on nibbles which would create
                     more amazement and produce a greater sensational effect in diplomatic circles
                     than anything that ever appeared in a treaty. The introduction of the subject
                     of nibbles to international law would give that science refreshing variety and
                     probably prevent devastating wars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is another cause of suffering to the fisherman that when he has thrown in
                     again, and has waited an hour for a bite, and waited in vain, he considers it
                     safe to drop his rod for a<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6059-00000087"/> moment,
                     so that he can light his pipe. It is a peculiar circumstance, I say, that just
                     as he has struck his last match he always gets the most vigorous bite of the
                     whole day. The cork pulls under in the most exciting manner several times, and
                     only floats up again permanently at the moment when the angler seizes his rod
                     in eager haste and finds that the fish is gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is this kind of thing that makes the fisherman feel as if he would be
                     relieved by the use of violent language. The British premier, I am sure, will
                     consent to the negotiation of another treaty if you will press this matter on
                     him. He must see at once that unless bites are arranged with a greater regard
                     for the feelings of the fisherman and for the sanctity of the law against
                     profane swearing, the fishery interests will languish and the crop prove a
                     humiliating failure.</p>
                  <p>I have often remarked, too, that when the fisherman has nearly landed a fish,
                     which drops off the hook just as it appears to be safe, he collects all his
                     energies for the next bite. He grasps the rod tightly with both hands, he rises
                     and plants his legs firmly upon the ground, he watches the cork carefully, with
                     his lips compressed and with fiery determination gleaming from his eyes. The
                     cork moves slightly. It goes under; he has a good bite; he pulls up with
                     frightful energy, determined not to lose this one, and the next instant his
                     line hits the limb of the tree overhead, and winds around it as closely as if
                     it was put there on purpose to splice that limb, so as to make it perfectly
                     secure throughout the unending ages of eternity.</p>
                  <p>I always excuse the man for taking a gloomy view of life, and for saying over
                     with ardor and vehemence his entire reserve stock of objurgations as he shins
                     up the tree. But has the government no duty in the matter? What is the use of
                     joint high commissions if these things are to be allowed? We have made the
                     republic successful, we have fought mighty battles, we have paid millions of
                     indebtedness and we have given the civilization of the world a tremendous
                     impulse forward; now let us do something for the disgusted fisherman who has to
                     fumble around out on that limb. Let us have a special treaty on that particular
                     branch of the subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>If something could be done in relation to eels, I think the government of our
                     beloved country would rest upon a foundation of greater stability and have a
                     more permanent hold upon popular affection. Perhaps you have fished for eels?
                     The eel gently pulls the cork under and lets go. You pull up suddenly, and
                     throw in again. The eel tenderly draws the cork beneath the surface, and, wild
                     with fury, you jerk out your line a second time. This exhilarating exercise
                     continues for some moments, and you make up your mind that existence will be a
                     burden, the world a hollow sham, and groceries and marketing useless baubles,
                     unless you catch that eel. Finally you do hook him and draw him out. He is
                     active, playful and vivacious. He wriggles; he forms himself in quick
                     succession into S's, C's and Q's. He points<pb n="174-175"
                        xml:id="VAC6059-00000088"/> to all the four quarters of the compass at once.
                     He swallows himself and spits himself out. He wraps himself around your boot
                     and shoots up your leg and covers your trowsers with slime, and tangles your
                     line into a mess by the side of which the Gordian knot was the perfection of
                     simplicity. When you get your foot firmly on him, you find that he has
                     swallowed the hook, and you have to cut him completely open, from head to tail,
                     to get the hook out, and then, as likely as not, the eel will flip back into
                     the water and escape. I think eels rarely die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>A joint high commission which would devote itself with philanthropic ardor and
                     untiring energy to a dispassionate consideration of the subject of the
                     immortality of eels might, perhaps, achieve important results. Any settlement
                     of the fishery question which overlooked the hideous wickedness of eels would
                     be a cruel mockery of human woe.</p>
                  <p>But for pure pathos, I can conceive of nothing that will equal the anguish of
                     the fisherman when he imagines he has a catfish upon his hook. His cork is
                     drawn slowly under the surface, and it goes down, down, down, until it sinks
                     completely out of sight. He is certain it is a catfish—they always pull in this
                     manner, he says; and he draws in his line gently, while the fish tugs and pulls
                     at the other end. Gradually, v-e-r-y gradually, the fisherman pulls it in, in
                     order to be sure to keep the prey upon the hook. It is evidently a very large
                     fish, and he is determined to land it through the shallow water, so that it
                     cannot drop back and escape. Slowly it comes up, and just as the hook nears the
                     surface the angler gives a sudden jerk, and out comes a terrific snag with a
                     dozen branches and covered with mud. And meanwhile, during all the fisherman's
                     troubles, there is that infamous small boy sitting on the opposite bank of the
                     creek pulling up fish by the dozen with a pin-hook and some wrapping twine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would gratify me if the new treaty would devote one clause to a definite
                     settlement of the question of the bearing of snags upon the miseries of
                     mankind, and about eight stupendous clauses to a determination of the fate that
                     is deserved by that boy. My own humanitarian tendencies incline me to urge that
                     he should be summarily shot. If a boy with a pin-hook is to be allowed thus to
                     destroy the peace of older American citizens, the sooner we ask some efficient
                     and reliable despot to come over here and break up the government and trample
                     on us, the happier we shall be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>I commend the subject to your enlightened consideration, and ask for an earnest
                     appeal to the next Congress in behalf of suffering fishermen. If we cannot
                     obtain redress by peaceful means, let us have it by force. I am ready to
                     overturn the government, massacre the people, burn the cities and carry
                     desolation, devastation and death into every home in the land, rather than to
                        permit<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6059-00000089"/> mit these outrages against
                     justice longer to continue and these unhappy men to endure further
                     persecution.</p>
                  <p>There are indications that the course of Bob Parker's true love will not run
                     entirely smooth. The officers stationed at Fort Delaware, below here, come up
                     to the village constantly upon social errands,' and they are exceedingly
                     popular with the young ladies. Lieutenant Smiley is, I think, the favorite; and
                     as he has become a somewhat frequent visitor at Magruder's, Bob's jealousy has
                     been aroused. He hates Smiley with a certain deadly hatred. Mr. Parker is not
                     naturally warlike in his tendencies, but I believe he would willingly engage in
                     hostilities with the lieutenant with an utterly reckless disregard of the
                     consequences.</p>
                  <p>Smiley comes to see us sometimes; and Bob, I fear, regards even this family
                     with gloom and suspicion because we receive the lieutenant courteously. But he
                     says very little upon the subject; for when he begins to abuse Smiley, I always
                     ask him why he does not propose to Miss Magruder at once and thus relieve
                     himself from his agony of apprehension. Then he beats a retreat. He would
                     rather face a regiment of Smileys armed with Dahlgren guns than to discuss the
                     subject of his cowardice respecting the beautiful Magruder.</p>
                  <p>We like the lieutenant well enough, and we should like him better but for his
                     propensity for telling incredible stories. He was in the naval service for
                     eight or ten years; and when he undertakes to give accounts of his adventures,
                     he is very apt to introduce anecdotes of which Munchausen would have been
                     ashamed. It is one of Smiley's favorite theories that he sojourned for a
                     considerable period among the Fiji Islands, and many of his narratives relate
                     his experiences in that region. There was a missionary meeting at the church a
                     night or two ago, and the lieutenant, having been defeated by Bob in his
                     attempt to escort Miss Magruder to her home, came to our house; and very
                     naturally he began the conversation with a story of missionary enterprise with
                     which he assumed to have become familiar during his visit to the South
                     Seas.</p>

                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Mr. Adeler," he said, "I was very much interested in the proceedings at that
                     meeting to-night, but it seems to me that there is one defect in the system of
                     preparing men for the work of propagating the gospel among the heathen."</p>
                  <p>"What is that?"</p>
                  <p>"Why they ought to teach the science of mesmerism in the divinity schools."</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"I don't exactly understand the purpose of the—"</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps you never heard of the Rev. Mr. Blodgett, missionary to the Fiji
                     Islands? Well, he saved his life once merely by practicing mesmerism. He has
                     told me the story often."</p>
                  <p>"I should like to hear it."</p>
                  <p>"It seems that Blodgett in his sinful youth had been a traveling professor of
                     mesmerism; but he had abandoned the business to go into the ministry and to
                     preach <figure/>
                     <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6059-00000090"/> to the heathen in Fiji. Well, his
                     church out there got up a Sunday-school picnic, it appears; and when the people
                     all arrived upon the ground, they learned that the provisions had been
                     forgotten. A meeting of the vestry was called, and after a brief consultation
                     it was decided that the only thing which could be done to meet the emergency
                     was to barbecue the minister. The inducement to this course was all the
                     stronger because his salary was six months in arrears, and the church was
                     entirely out of funds. So they built a huge fire; and seizing Blodgett, they
                     began to strip him and to stick him with forks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>

                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"In order to save himself, he immediately mesmerized each member of the vestry;
                     and when they were all fixed, he called up the Sunday-school scholars, class by
                     class, and put them comfortably to sleep. Having them all completely under his
                     influence, he gave an entire class to each one of the vestrymen, and assured
                     them that the innocent children were the most luscious kind of missionary.
                     There-upon the hypnotized vestry immediately ate up the somnambulistic
                     Sunday-school and picked the bones clean. Blodgett was a very conscientious man
                     in the performance of his sacerdotal functions, so he read the funeral service
                     over each class as it disappeared."</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Rather an excessive meal, I should say."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but they are large eaters, the Fijians. You might say that their
                     appetites are, in a certain sense, robust."</p>
                  <p>"I should imagine that such was the case. But proceed."</p>
                  <p>"Well, when the little ones were gone, Blodgett whispered to the magnetized
                     wardens that their fellow-vestrymen were also succulent propagators of
                     Christianity; whereupon the unconscious wardens fell upon their colleagues, and
                     in a few moments nearly the whole vestry was in the process of assimilation.
                     There remained now but the two wardens, and Blodgett, having prevailed upon the
                     younger and more vigorous of the two to eat the other, then seized the
                     slumbering body of his converted <figure/>
                     <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6059-00000091"/> but erring brother and stood it on
                     its head in the fire. The Rev. Mr. Blodgett went away alone from that picnic,
                     and he went with a heavy heart. When he got home, they asked where the rest of
                     the folks were, and he said they were enjoying themselves up there in the woods
                     in their own quiet, innocent way, but that he had to come away in order to
                     visit a sick friend who stood in need of his ministrations. And then he packed
                     his trunk and borrowed a canoe and paddled away to our ship, determined to seek
                     some sunnier <figure/> clime, where the heathen rage less furiously, and where
                     the popular appetite for warm clergyman is not so intensely vivid."</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"That is a very remarkable narrative, lieutenant—very remarkable indeed!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. But poor Mott was not so lucky."</p>
                  <p>"Who was Mott?"</p>
                  <p>"Why the Rev. Peter Mott—he was a missionary engaged upon one of the other
                     islands. He knew nothing of mesmerism; and when his choir attacked him upon the
                     way home from church one day, he was unable to defend himself, and they ate
                     him."</p>
                  <p>"How painful!"</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"I had to carry the mournful news to Mrs. Mott, who lived in San Francisco.
                     When we reached that port, I called upon her and performed the unpleasant duty.
                     The manner in which she received the intelligence was, I conceive, in every way
                     extraordinary. She cried, of course, and I offered her what consolation I could
                     under the circumstances. I alluded to the fact that all men must die at any
                     rate, and dear Mott, let us hope, had gone to a better world than this one of
                     sorrow and trouble and so forth.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Mott in reply said, with a voice broken with sobs: <figure/>
                     <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6059-00000092"/> 'It isn't that—oh, it isn't that. I
                     know he is better off; I'm sure he is happier; but you know what a very
                     particular man he was, and oh, Mr. Smiley, I fear that those brutal savages
                     boiled him with cabbage.' There was no use trying to assuage her grief under
                     such circumstances, so I shook hands with her and left. But it was an odd idea.
                     Mott with cabbage! I thought as I came away that he would have tasted better
                     with the merest flavor of onion."</p>
                  <p>When Lieutenant Smiley bade us good-night, I said,</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Adeler, what do you think of that young man?"</p>
                  <p>"I think," she said, "that he tells the most dreadful falsehoods I ever
                     listened to. It will be a burning shame if he succeeds in cutting out Robert
                     with Miss Magruder."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Adeler, he shall not do that. Bob shall have Miss Magruder at all
                     hazards. If he does not propose to her shortly, I shall go down and broach the
                     subject to her myself. We must defeat Smiley even if we have to violate all the
                     rules of propriety to achieve that result."</p>

               <p>WE have had a great deal of trouble recently with our kitchen boiler, which is
                  built into the wall over the range. It sprang aleak a few weeks ago, and the
                  assistance of a plumber had to be invoked for the purpose of repairing it. I sent
                  for the plumber, and after examining the boiler, he instructed the servant to let
                  the fire go out that night, so that he could begin operations early the next
                  morning. His order was obeyed, but in the morning the plumber failed to appear. We
                  had a cold and very uncomfortable breakfast, and on my way to the dépôt I overtook
                  the plumber going in the same direction. He said he was sorry to disappoint me,
                  but he was called suddenly out of town on imperative business, and he would have
                  to ask me to wait until the next morning, when he would be promptly on hand with
                  his men. So we had no fire in the range upon that<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000093"/> day, and the family breakfasted again upon cool
                  viands without being cheered with a view of the plumber. Upon calling at the
                  plumber's shop to ascertain why he had not fulfilled his promise, I was informed
                  by the clerk that he had returned, but that he was compelled to go over to
                  Wilmington. The man seemed so thoroughly in earnest in his assertion that the
                  plumber positively would attend to my boiler upon the following morning that we
                  permitted the range to remain untouched, and for the third time we broke our fast
                  with a frigid repast. But the plumber and his assistants did not come.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>As it seemed to be wholly impossible to depend upon these faithless artisans, our
                  cook was instructed to bring the range into service again without waiting longer
                  for repairs, and to give the family a properly prepared meal in the morning. While
                  we were <figure/> at breakfast there was a knock at the gate, and presently we
                  perceived the plumber and his men coming up the yard with a general assortment of
                  tools and materials. The range at the moment of his entrance to the kitchen was
                  red hot; and when he realized the fact, he flung his tools on the floor and
                  expressed his indignation in the most violent and improper language, while his
                  attendant fiends sat around in the chairs and growled in sympathy with their
                  chief. When I appeared upon the scene, the plumber addressed me with the air of a
                  man who had suffered a great and irreparable wrong at my hands, and he really
                  displayed so much feeling that for a few moments I had an indistinct consciousness
                  that I had somehow been guilty of an act of gross injustice to an unfortunate and
                  persecuted fellow-being. Before I could recover myself sufficiently to present my
                  side of the case with the force properly belonging to it, the plumbers marched
                  into the yard, where they tossed a quantity of machinery and tools and lead pipe
                  under the shed, and then left.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>We had no fire in the range the next morning, but the plumbers did not come until
                  four o'clock in the afternoon, and then they merely dumped a<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000094"/> cart load of lime-boxes and hoes upon the asparagus
                  bed and went home. An interval of four days elapsed before we heard of them again;
                  and meanwhile the cook twice nearly killed herself by stumbling over the tools
                  while going out into the shed in the dark. One morning, however, the gang arrived
                  before I had risen; and when I came down to breakfast, I found that they had made
                  a mortar bed on our best grass plot, and had closed up the principal garden walk
                  with a couple of wagon loads of sand. I endured this patiently <figure/> because
                  it seemed to promise speedy performance of the work. The plumbers, however, went
                  away at about nine o'clock, and the only reason we had for supposing they had not
                  forgotten us was that a man with a cart called in the afternoon and shot a
                  quantity of bricks down upon the pavement in such a position that nobody could go
                  in or out of the front gate. Two days afterward the plumbers came and began to
                  make a genuine effort to reach the boiler. It was buried in the wall in such a
                  manner that it was wholly inaccessible by any other method than by the removal of
                  the bricks from the outside. The man who erected the house evidently was a party
                  with the plumber to a conspiracy to <figure/> give the latter individual something
                  to do. They labored right valiantly at the wall, and by supper-time they had
                  removed at least twelve square feet of it, making a hole large enough to have
                  admitted a locomotive. Then they took <figure/> out the old boiler and went away,
                  leaving a most discouraging mass of rubbish lying about the yard.</p>
               <p>That was the last we saw of them for more than a week. Whenever I went after the
                  plumber for the purpose of persuading him to hasten the work, I learned that he
                  had been summoned to Philadelphia as a witness in a court case, or that he had
                  gone to his aunt's funeral, or that he was taking a holiday because it was his
                  wife's birthday, or that he had a sore eye. I have never been able to understand
                  why the house was not robbed. An entire brigade of burglars might have entered the
                  cottage and frolicked among its treasures without any difficulty. I did propose at
                  first that Bob and I should procure revolvers and take watch and watch every<pb
                     n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6059-00000095"/> night until the breach in the wall
                  should be repaired; but Mr. Parker did not regard the plan with enthusiasm, and it
                  was abandoned. We had to content ourselves with fastening the inner door of the
                  kitchen as securely as possible, and we were not molested. But we were nervous.
                  Mrs. Adeler, I think, assured me positively at least twice every night that she
                  heard robbers on the stairs, and entreated me not to go out after them; and I
                  never did.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>

               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Finally the men came and began to fill the hole with new bricks. That evening the
                  plumber walked into my parlor with mud and mortar on his boots, and informed me
                  that by an unfortunate mistake the hole left for the boiler by the bricklayers was
                  far too small, and he could not insert the boiler without taking the wall down
                  again.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Mr. Nippers," I said, "don't you think it would be a good idea for me to engage
                  you permanently to labor upon that boiler? From the manner in which this business
                  has been conducted, I infer that I can finally be rid of annoyance about such
                  matters by employing a perennial plumber to live for ever in my back yard, and to
                  spend the unending cycles of eternity banging boilers and demolishing walls."</p>
               <p>Mr. Nippers said, with apparent seriousness, that he thought it would be a
                  first-rate thing.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Nippers, I am going to ask a favor of you. I do not insist upon compliance
                  with my request. I know that I am at your mercy. Nippers, you have me, and I
                  submit patiently to my fate. But my family is suffering from cold, we are exposed
                  to the ravages of thieves, we are deprived of the means of cooking our food
                  properly, and we are made generally <figure/> uncomfortable by the condition of
                  our kitchen. I ask you, therefore, as a personal favor to a man who wishes you
                  prosperity here and felicity hereafter, and who means to settle your bill
                  promptly, to fix that boiler at once."</p>
               <p>Mr. Nippers thereupon said that he always liked me, and he swore a solemn oath
                  that he would complete the job next day without fail. That was on Tuesday. Neither
                  Nippers nor his men came again until Saturday, and then they put the boiler in its
                  place and went away, leaving four or five cart loads of ruins in the yard. On
                  Sunday the boiler began to leak as badly as ever, and I feel sure Nippers must
                  have set the old one in again, although when he called early Monday morning with a
                  bill for $237 84/100, which he wanted at once because he had a note to meet, he
                  declared upon his<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6059-00000096"/> honor that the boiler
                  was a new one, and that it would not leak under a pressure of one thousand pounds
                  to the square inch.</p>
               <p>I am going to buy a cooking stove, and defy Nippers and the entire plumbing
                  fraternity.</p>
               <p>Cooley's boy has been in trouble again. Yesterday morning Mrs. Adeler heard loud
                  screaming in Cooley's yard, and in a few moments a servant came to say that Mrs.
                  Cooley wished to see Mrs. Adeler at once. Mrs. A. hurried over there, supposing
                  that something terrible had happened. She found Mrs. Cooley shaking her boy and
                  crying, while the lad stood, the picture of misery and fright, his eyes protruding
                  from his head and his hands holding his stomach. Mrs. Cooley explained in a voice
                  broken with sobs that Henry had been playing with a small "mouth organ," and had
                  accidentally swallowed it. The case was somewhat peculiar; and as Mrs. Adeler was
                  not familiar with the professional methods which are adopted in such emergencies,
                  she recommended simply a liberal use of mustard and warm water. The application
                  was ultimately successful, and the missing musical instrument was surrendered by
                  the boy. The incident is neither interesting nor remarkable, and I certainly
                  should not have mentioned it but for the fact that it had a result which is
                  perhaps worth chronicling here.</p>

               <p>Last evening Bob came into the sitting-room and behaved in a manner which led me
                  to believe that he had something on his mind. I asked him if anything was the
                  matter. He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, no; not exactly. The fact is I've been thinking about that accident to
                  Cooley's boy, and it kind of suggested something to me."</p>
               <p>"What was the nature of the suggestion?"</p>
               <p>"I've jotted it down on paper. I've half a notion to send it to the
                     <title>Argus</title> if you think it's good enough, and that's what I want to
                  find out. I want to hear your opinion of the story. I don't do much of this sort
                  of thing, and I'm kind of shy about it. Shall I read it?"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Of course; let us hear it."</p>
               <p>"I'm going to call it 'The Fate of Young Chubb.' I expect it'll make old Cooley
                  mad as fury when he sees it. It is founded upon the catastrophe of which his boy
                  was the victim."</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>THE FATE OF YOUNG CHUBB.</head>
                  <p>When Mr. Chubb, the elder, returned from Europe, he brought with him from
                     Geneva a miniature musical box, long and very narrow, and altogether of hardly
                     greater dimensions, say, than a large pocket-knife. The instrument played four
                     cheerful little tunes for the benefit of the Chubb family, and they enjoyed it.
                     Young Henry Chubb enjoyed it to such an extent that, one day, just after the
                     machine had been wound up ready for action, he got to sucking the end <figure/>
                     <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6059-00000097"/> of it, and in a moment of
                     inadvertence it slipped, and he swallowed it. The only immediate consequence of
                     the accident was that a harmonic stomach-ache was organized upon the interior
                     of Henry Chubb, and he experienced a restlessness which he well knew would defy
                     peppermint and paregoric.</p>
                  <p>Henry Chubb kept his secret in his own soul, and in his stomach also,
                     determined to hide his misery from his father, and to spare the rod to the
                     spoiled child—spoiled, at any rate, as far as his digestive apparatus was
                     concerned.</p>
                  <p>But that evening, at the supper-table, Henry had eaten but one mouthful of
                     bread when strains of wild, mysterious <figure/> music were suddenly wafted
                     from under the table. The family immediately made an effort to discover whence
                     the sounds came, although Henry Chubb sat there filled with agony and remorse
                     and bread and tunes, and desperately asserted his belief that the music came
                     from the cellar, where the servant-girl was concealed with a harp. He well knew
                     that Mary Ann was unfamiliar with the harp. But he was frantic with anxiety to
                     hide his guilt. Thus it is that one crime leads to another.</p>
                  <p>But he could not disguise the truth for ever, and that very night, while the
                     family was at prayers, Henry all at once began to hiccough, and the music box
                     started off without warning with "Way down upon the Suwanee River," with
                     variations. Whereupon the paternal Chubb arose from his knees and grasped Henry
                     kindly but firmly by his hair and shook him up and inquired what he meant by
                     such conduct. And Henry asserted that he was practicing something for a
                     Sunday-school celebration, which old Chubb intimated was a singularly thin
                     explanation. Then they tried to get up that music box, and every time they
                     would seize Henry by the legs and shake him over the sofa cushion, or would
                     pour some fresh variety of emetic down his throat, the instrument within would
                     give a fresh spurt, and joyously grind out "Listen to the Mocking Bird" or
                     "Thou'lt Never Cease to Love."</p>

                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>At last they were compelled to permit that musical box to remain within the
                     sepulchral recesses of young Chubb. To say that the<pb n="194-195"
                        xml:id="VAC6059-00000098"/> unfortunate victim of the disaster was made
                     miserable by his condition would be to express in the feeblest manner the state
                     of his mind. The more music there was in his stomach, the wilder and more
                     completely chaotic became the discord in his soul. As likely as not it would
                     occur that while he lay asleep in the middle of the night the works would begin
                     to revolve, and would play "Home, Sweet Home" for two or three hours, unless
                     the peg happened to slip, when the cylinder would switch back again to "Way
                     down upon the Suwanee River," and would rattle out that tune with variations
                     and fragments of the scales until Henry's brother would kick him out of bed in
                     wild despair, and sit on him in a vain effort to subdue the serenade, which,
                     however, invariably proceeded with fresh vigor when subjected to unusual
                     pressure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when Henry Chubb went to church, it frequently occurred that, in the very
                     midst of the most solemn portion of the sermon, he would feel a gentle
                     disturbance under the lower button of his jacket; and presently, when
                     everything was hushed, the undigested engine would give a preliminary buzz and
                     then reel off "Listen to the Mocking Bird" and "Thou'lt Never Cease to Love,"
                     and scales and exercises, until the clergyman would stop and glare at Henry
                     over his spectacles and whisper to one of the <figure/> deacons. Then the
                     sexton would suddenly tack up the aisle and clutch the unhappy Mr. Chubb by the
                     collar and scud down the aisle again to the accompaniment of "Home, Sweet
                     Home," and then incarcerate Henry in the upper portion of the steeple until
                     after church.</p>
                  <p>But the end came at last, and the miserable boy found peace. One day while he
                     was sitting in school endeavoring to learn his multiplication table to the tune
                     of "Thou'lt Never Cease to Love," his gastric juice triumphed. Something or
                     other in the music box gave way all at once, the springs were unrolled with
                     alarming force, and Henry Chubb, as he felt the fragments of the instrument
                     hurled right and left among his vitals, tumbled over on the floor and
                     expired.</p>
                  <p>At the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">post mortem</foreign> examination they found
                     several pieces of "Home, Sweet Home" in his liver, while one of his lungs was
                     severely torn by a fragment of "Way down upon the Suwanee River." Small
                     particles of "Listen to the Mocking Bird" were removed from his heart and
                     breast-bone, and three brass pegs of "Thou'lt Never Cease to Love" were found
                     firmly driven into his fifth rib.</p>
                  <p>They had no music at the funeral. They sifted the machinery out of him and
                     buried him quietly in the cemetery. Whenever the Chubbs buy musical boxes now,
                     they get them as large as a piano and chain them to the wall.</p>

                  <p>While Bob was engaged in reading the account of the melodious misery of the
                     unhappy Chubb, Lieutenant Smiley came in, and the result was that both became
                     uneasy. Bob disliked to subject himself to the criticism of a man whom he
                     regarded as an enemy, and the lieutenant was so jealous of Bob's success that
                     he began instantly to try to think of something that would enable him at least
                     to maintain his reputation as a teller of stories.</p>
                  <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6059-00000099"/>
                  <p>"That is very good indeed, Bob," I said. "Bangs will be only too glad to
                     publish it. It is very creditable. Put your name to it, however, if it goes
                     into the <title>Argus,</title> or the colonel will persuade the community that
                     he is the author of it."</p>
                  <p>"He will have to get a new brain-pan set in before he can write anything as
                     good," said Bob.</p>
                  <p>"It is a very amusing story," remarked Mrs. Adeler. "I had no idea that you
                     ever attempted such things. It is quite good, is it not, lieutenant?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, very good indeed," said Smiley. "V-e-r-y good. Quite an achievement, in
                     fact. Ha! ha! do you know that name 'Chubb' reminds me of a very comical
                     incident."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed?"</p>
                  <p>"Ha! yes! Old General Chubb was the actor in it. Perhaps you knew him,
                     Parker?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I didn't," growled Bob.</p>
                  <p>"Well, he was a very eccentric old man. Deuced queer, you know, and the most
                     absent-minded person that ever lived. He had a wooden leg late in his life, and
                     I've often known him to put that leg on backward with the toes pointing behind
                     him, and then he would come jolting down the street in the most extraordinary
                     manner, with his good knee bending north and his timber knee doubling up
                     southwardly; and when I would meet him, he would stop and growl because the
                     authorities kept the pavements in such bad repair that a man could hardly
                     walk."</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"I don't see anything very funny about that," said Bob, impolitely and
                     savagely.</p>
                  <p>"Well, one day a few months ago," continued Smiley, without noticing Mr.
                     Parker's ill-nature, "he sauntered into the studio of the celebrated marine
                     painter Hamilton, in Philadelphia. The artist was out at the moment, but
                     standing upon the floor was a large and very superb picture of the sea-beach,
                     with the surf rolling in upon it. The general stood looking at it for a while,
                     until his mind wandered off from the present, and under the influence of the
                     picture he was gradually impressed with a vague notion that he was at the
                     seashore. So, still gazing at the painting, he slowly removed his clothes, <figure/>
                     <figure/>
                     <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6059-00000100"/> and finally stood in a revery
                     without a stitch upon him. Then he clasped his nose with his fingers, bent his
                     neck forward and plunged head foremost into the surf. The people on the floor
                     below thought there was an earthquake. The artist came rushing in, and found
                     General Chubb with his head against the washboard, one leg hanging from the
                     ragged surf and the toes of his left foot struggling among the ruins of the
                     lighthouse. Hamilton has that torn picture yet. He says that Chubb's dive is
                     the highest tribute ever paid to his genius."</p>
                  <p>As the lieutenant finished the narrative, Bob rose and left the room with the
                     suggestion, muttered as he passed me, that the story was tough.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Parker don't seem well," remarked the lieutenant when Bob had gone.</p>
                  <p>"Oh yes, he is perfectly well. I imagine that he does not regard you with
                     precisely the same amount of enthusiastic admiration that he might perhaps feel
                     if you were not treading on his toes a little."</p>
                  <p>"Oh," laughed the lieutenant, "you refer, of course, to our relations with the
                     Magruders? I don't like to talk much about that matter, of course; it is
                     delicate, and you may think I am meddling with a business in which I have no
                     concern. But perhaps I may as well tell you frankly that Parker has no earthly
                     chance there—not the least in the world. The young lady won't smile on him. I
                     am as certan of that as I am of death."</p>
                  <p>"You are positive of that, are you?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, you can rely upon my word. Parker might as well give it up. By the
                     way, I wonder if he has gone down there now?"</p>
                  <p>"Very likely."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I must say good-night, then; I promised to call there at half-past
                     eight, and it is time to be off."</p>
                  <p>So Lieutenant Smiley bade us adieu. Mrs. Adeler immediately asked:</p>
                  <p>"Do you believe what that man says?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly not, my dear. I have as much faith as a dozen ordinary men, but it
                     would require a grand army to believe him. He is foolish enough to hope to
                     frighten Bob away. But Bob shall settle the matter to-morrow. If he doesn't, we
                     will disown him. The end of the campaign has come. Now for victory or
                     defeat!"</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is St. Pillory's Day. It is the day upon which humane and liberal Delawarians
                  hang their heads for shame at the insult offered to civilization by the law of
                  their State. That law this morning placed half a dozen miserable creatures in the
                  stocks, and then flogged them upon their naked flesh with a cat-o'-nine-tails. It
                  was no slight thing to stand there wearing that wooden collar in this bitter
                  November weather, with the north-east wind blowing in fierce gusts from the broad
                  expanse of the river; and one poor wretch who endured that suffering was so
                  benumbed with cold that he could hardly climb down the ladder to the ground. And
                  when he had descended, they lashed his back until it was covered with purple
                  stripes. He had stolen some provisions, and he looked as if he needed them, for he
                  seemed hungry and forlorn and utterly desperate with misery. It would have been a
                  kindlier act of Christian charity if society, instead of mutilating his body, had
                  fed it and clothed it properly, and placed him in some reformatory institution
                  where his soul could have been taken care of. But that is not the method that
                  prevails here.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The gates of the prison yard were wide open when the punishment was inflicted upon
                  these offenders, and among the spectators were at least two or three score
                  children gathered to look upon the barbarous spectacle. Nothing could induce me to
                  permit mine to witness it. The influence of such a scene is wholly brutalizing.
                  The child that has seen that sacrifice has lost some of the sweetness and
                  tenderness of its better nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The whipping-post and pillory is a sturdy bit of timber a foot square. Eight or
                  nine feet from the ground it pierces a small platform, and five feet above this
                  there is a cross-piece which contains in each of its two arms a hole for the neck
                  and two holes for the wrists of the man who is to be pilloried. The upper half of
                  the arm lifts to admit the victim, and then closes upon him, sometimes very
                  tightly. It is fastened down with a wedge-shaped key, shot into the centre-post.
                  Beneath the platform hangs<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6059-00000102"/> a pair of
                  handcuffs in which the wrists of those who are to be flogged are placed. The whole
                  machine looks like a gigantic cross. It is black with age, covered with patches of
                  green mold and moss, and shrunken and split until the grain of the wood protrudes
                  in ridges.</p>
               <p>There was a time in the past when it stood, an instrument of cruel torture, upon
                  the public street. It was planted in the green just at the end of the old market
                  house, and there the criminals were lashed by the sheriff. Any of the old men who
                  have spent their lives in this place can tell how, when they were boys, it was the
                  custom for the urchins and the loafers of the town to pelt any poor rogue who was
                  pilloried with whatever missiles happened to be at hand; and often the creatures
                  thus abused were taken down from the stocks and tied up to the post, there to have
                  their flesh lacerated with the leather thongs. They used to flog women, too. They
                  flogged women in the open street, with their garments torn away from their bodies
                  above the waist, and the gaping crowd gathered about and witnessed without shame
                  that dreadful spectacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But that was more than half a century ago. Who shall say that we do not advance in
                  civilization? Who can assert that these people have not acquired a higher sense of
                  decency, when public opinion has compelled the removal of this abominable relic of
                  barbarism to the jail-yard, and the performance of the penalty in another place
                  than before the doors of the temple where a God of mercy is worshiped? I hope that
                  the day is not far distant when the whipping-post and the infernal system that
                  sustains it will go down together, and when the people of this State will learn
                  that their first duty to a criminal is to strive to make him a better man.</p>
               <p>They say here, in apologizing for the institution, that the punishment is not
                  severe, because the sheriff never makes savage use of the lash. But it is a
                  terrible infliction, no matter how lightly the blows are struck, for it is imposed
                  in the presence of a multitude, and the sufferer feels that he is for ever to be
                  known among men as a thief. The thongs do not always fall gently; the force of the
                  lash depends upon the will of the sheriff, who may kill a man with the number of
                  blows which in another case give no pain. I say that any law which places such
                  discretionary power in the hands of an executive officer who may be bribed or
                  frightened, or who may have some personal injury to avenge, defeats the true end
                  of justice. The court should fix the penalty absolutely. They say here, also, that
                  no man is ever flogged a second time. That is untrue. The same men do return again
                  and again. Some do not; but where do they go? Why, to other communities, where
                  they perpetrate other crimes and become a burden upon other people. We have no
                  right to breed criminals and then to drive them into cities and towns that have
                  already enough of their own. We are under a sacred obligation to place them in
                  prisons supported by the money of the State, and there to attempt to teach them
                  arts by which they may earn their bread if they will. In such a place a convict
                  can be reached by those philanthropists who realize what society owes to its
                  criminal classes. But as he is treated now, it is impossible that he should ever
                  lift himself or be lifted to a purer and better life.</p>
               <p>Fallen angels in Delaware never rise again. Law clips their wings and stamps upon
                  them with its heel, and society shakes off the dust of its feet upon them and
                  curses them in their degradation. The gates of mercy are shut upon them<pb
                     n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6059-00000103"/> hopelessly and for ever, and they walk
                  abroad with the story of their shame blazoned upon them, as the women who wore the
                  Scarlet Letter in the old Puritan times in New England, that all the world may
                  read it. They know that their punishment has been fierce and terrible and out of
                  all proportion to their offence, and they curse their oppressors and hate them
                  with a bitter, unrelenting hatred. They know they will not be allowed to reform,
                  and that the law which should have led them to a better future has cut them off
                  from fellowship with their race, robbed them of their humanity and made pariahs
                  and outcasts of them. They are turned to stone, and they come out of their prisons
                  confirmed, hopeless criminals.</p>
               <p>A certain judge who administered Delaware justice here once upon a time (we will
                  say it was a thousand years ago) was a very peculiar man in certain of his
                  methods. I do not know whether he was merely fond of listening to the music of his
                  own voice, as too many less reverend and awful men are, or whether he really loved
                  to torture the prisoners in the dock, when he sentenced them, by keeping them in
                  suspense respecting his intentions, and by exciting hopes which he finally
                  crushed. But he had a way of assuming a mild and benevolent aspect as he addressed
                  a convicted man which was very reassuring to the unhappy wight, and then he
                  usually proceeded to deliver a few remarks which were so ingeniously arranged,
                  which expressed such <figure/> tender and affectionate sympathy, which were so
                  highly charged with benevolence, so expressive, as it were, of a passionate
                  yearning for the welfare of the victim, that the latter at last would be convinced
                  that the judge was about to give him an exceedingly light sentence. Just as he had
                  gotten himself into a frame of mind suitable to the unexpected brightness of his
                  prospects, the judge's custom was to bring his observations suddenly to an end,
                  and to hurl at the head of the convict, still with that philanthropic expression
                  upon his countenance, the most frightful penalty permitted by the law.</p>
               <p>On a certain day, while a certain historian was in court, he was engaged in
                  exercising a youth named Busby in this fashion. Busby, it appears, was accused of
                  stealing seventy-five cents' worth of old iron from somebody, and the jury had
                  found him guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Busby was ordered to stand up, and the judge, permitting a peculiarly bland smile
                  to play upon his features, gazed tenderly at the prisoner, while he placed a small
                  pinch of tobacco in his mouth; and then, drawing a long breath, he began:</p>
               <p>"George Washington Busby, you have been found guilty by a jury of your
                  fellow-countrymen of an offence against society and against the peace and dignity
                  of the commonwealth<figure/>
                  <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6059-00000104"/> wealth of Delaware, and I have now to
                  impose upon you the penalties provided by the law. I am very, very sorry to see
                  you here, George, and it grieves my heart to be compelled to fulfill the
                  obligation devolving upon me as a judicial officer. Pause, I entreat you, at this
                  the very outset of your career, and reflect upon what you are casting from you.
                  You are a young man; you are, as it were, in the very morning of your life; a
                  bright and happy home is yours, and around you are the kind parents and friends
                  who have made you the child of their prayers, who have guided your footsteps from
                  infancy, who have loved and cherished you and made for you mighty sacrifices.</p>
               <p>"You have a mother"—and here the judge's voice faltered and he wiped away a
                  tear—"a mother at whose knee you were taught to lisp your earliest devotions, and
                  who has watched over you and ministered to you with that tender and fervent love
                  that only a mother can feel. You have a father who looked upon you with a heart
                  swelling with pride, and who gave to you the heritage of his honest name. Up to
                  the time when, yielding to the insidious wiles of the tempter, you committed this
                  crime, your character had been irreproachable, and it seemed as if the brightest
                  promises of your childhood were to have rich and beneficent fulfillment. For you
                  the vista of the future appeared serene and beautiful; a pure and noble manhood
                  seemed to await you, and all the blessings which may be gained by an unspotted
                  reputation, by persistent energy and by earnest devotion to the right were to be
                  yours."</p>

               <p>Here Busby began to feel considerably better. He was assured that such a kind old
                  man as that could not treat him with severity, and he informed the tipstaff in a
                  whisper that he calculated now on about sixty days' imprisonment at the
                  furthest.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>The judge shifted the quid in his cheek, blew his nose, and resumed:</p>
               <p>"How difficult it is, then, for me to determine the precise measure of your
                  punishment! Knowing that the quality of mercy is not strained, and that as we
                  forgive so shall we be forgiven, how painful it is for me to draw the line between
                  undue leniency and the demands of outraged law! Considering, I say, all these
                  things, that are so much in your favor—your youth, your happy home, where the
                  holiest influences are shed upon your path, where parental love covers you with
                  its most gracious benediction, where your devoted mother lies stricken with
                  anguish at the sin of her idolized son, where your aged father has his gray hairs
                  brought down in sorrow to the grave, where you have been nurtured and admonished
                  and taught to do right—"</p>
               <p>"Certainly he can't intend to give me more than one month," said Busby to the
                  tipstaff.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Considering that this is your first offence; that your conduct hitherto has been
                  that of an honest young man, and that the lesson you have learned from this bitter
                  and terrible experience will sink deeply into your<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000105"/> heart; that you have opening out to you in the
                  possible future a life of usefulness and honor, with a prospect of redeeming this
                  single error and winning for yourself a respected name—"</p>
               <p>"He can't decently give me more than twenty days after that," suggested Busby.</p>
               <p>The judge, after wiping the moisture from his eyes and borrowing a morsel of
                  tobacco from the prosecuting attorney, continued:</p>
               <p>"In view of all these extenuating circumstances, in view of the fact, fully
                  recognized by this court, that justice is not revengeful, but exercises its
                  highest prerogative in leading the fallen to reformation and moral improvement—in
                  view, I say, of the fact that you are in the very spring-time of your existence,
                  with the vista of the future opening out with alluring brightness before you and
                  giving promise of higher and better things—in view of those sorrowing parents the
                  child of whose prayers you are; of that mother who guided your infant steps and
                  cared for you with the yearning tenderness of maternal love, of that venerable
                  father who looks upon you as the staff of his old age; considering, too, that this
                  is your first misstep from the path of duty—"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Two weeks as sure as death!" exclaimed Mr. Busby, joyfully, to the officer beside
                  him.</p>
               <p>"The path of duty," continued the judge, "and that up to the moment of the
                  commission of the deed you had been above suspicion and above reproach,—in view of
                  all this," remarked the judge, "I have thought it my duty, minister of the law
                  though I am, and bound though I am by my oath to vindicate the insulted majesty of
                  that law—"</p>
               <p>"If he gives me more than one week, I will never trust signs again," murmured
                  Busby.</p>
               <p>"I say that although I am bound to administer justice with an impartial hand, I
                  feel it to be incumbent upon me in this particular instance, in consequence of
                  these extenuating circumstances, to mete it out so that, while the law will be
                  vindicated, you may be taught that it is not cruel or unkind, but rather is
                  capable of giving the first generous impulse to reformation."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"He certainly means to let me off altogether," exclaimed Busby.</p>
               <p>"In view, then, of these mitigating circumstances of your youth, your previous
                  good character, your happy prospects, your afflicted parents and your own sincere
                  repentance, the sentence of the court is: That you, George Washington Busby, the
                  prisoner at the bar, do pay seventy-five cents restitution money and the costs of
                  this trial, and that on Saturday next you be whipped with twenty lashes on the
                  bare back, well laid on; that you be imprisoned for six months in the county jail,
                  and that you <figure/>
                  <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6059-00000106"/> wear a convict's jacket in public for
                  one year after your release. Sheriff, remove the prisoner from the court."</p>
               <p>Then the judge beamed a mournful but sympathetic smile upon Busby, secured the
                  loan of another atom of tobacco, spat on the floor and called up the next
                  case.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adeler, you laugh and say that I have indulged in gross exaggeration in
                  reproducing the sentence. Not so. I tell you that I have known a boy of thirteen
                  to have that condemnation, couched in almost precisely those words, hurled at him
                  from the bench of the New Castle court-house because he stole a bit of iron said
                  to be worth seventy-five cents. And I was present among the spectators in the jail
                  yard when the sheriff lashed the lad until he writhed with pain. It was
                  infamous—utterly infamous. I cannot, perhaps, justly accuse the judge who imposed
                  the sentence upon the boy of indulging in the lecture which has just been quoted.
                  That, as I have said, may be attributed to a magistrate who lived ten centuries
                  ago. But the sentence is genuine, and it was given recently. I do not blame the
                  judge. He acted under the authority of statutes which were created by other hands.
                  But the law is savagery itself, and the humane men of this State should sweep it
                  from existence.</p>

               <p>WHILE the scenes at the whipping-post on flogging-day are fresh in my mind, I have
                  written down the story of Mary Engle. It is a Delaware legend, and the events of
                  which it speaks occurred, I will say, seventy-odd years ago, when they were in the
                  habit of lashing women in this very town of New Castle.</p>
               <p>It was on Christmas day that a little party had assembled in the old Newton
                  mansion to participate in the festivities for which, at this season of the year,
                  it was famous all the country over. The house stood upon the river bank, three
                  miles and more from New Castle, and in that day it was considered the greatest and
                  handsomest building in the whole neighborhood. A broad lawn swept away from it
                  down to the water's edge, and in summer-time this was covered with bright-colored
                  flowers and bounded by green hedges. Now the grass was bleached with the cold;
                     the<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6059-00000107"/> hedges were brown and sere, and
                  the huge old trees, stripped of their foliage, moaned and creaked and shivered in
                  the wind, rattling their branches together as if seeking sympathy with each other
                  in their desolation.</p>
               <p>Inside the mansion the scene was as cheerful as life and fun and high spirits
                  could make it.</p>
               <p>Old Major Newton, the lord and master of all the wide estates, was one of the race
                  of country gentlemen who introduced to this continent the manners, habits and
                  large hospitality of the better class of English squires of his day. He was a
                  mighty fox-hunter, as many a brush hung in his dining-hall could attest. A
                  believer in the free use of the good things of life, his sideboard always
                  contained a dozen decanters, from which the coming, the remaining and the parting
                  guests were expected to follow the major's example in drinking deeply. His table
                  was always profusely supplied with good fare, and dining with him was the great
                  duty and pleasure of the day. He was a gentleman in education, and to some extent
                  in his tastes; but his manners partook of the coarseness of his time, for he swore
                  fierce oaths, and his temper was quick, terrible and violent. His forty negro
                  slaves were treated with indulgent kindness while they obeyed him implicitly, but
                  any attempt at insubordination upon their part called down upon their heads a
                  volley of oaths and that savage punishment which the major considered necessary to
                  discipline.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>To-day the major had been out of spirits, and had not joined heartily in the
                  hilarity of the company, which, despite the gloom of the master, made the old
                  house ring with the merriment and laughter due to the happiness of Christmas
                  time.</p>
               <p>At five o'clock dinner was done; and the ladies having withdrawn, the cloth was
                  removed, the wine and whisky and apple-toddy, and a half dozen other beverages,
                  were brought out, and the major, with his male guests, began the serious work of
                  the repast. The major sat at the head of the table; Dr. Ricketts, a jolly bachelor
                  of fifty, who neglected medicine that he might better spend his fortune in a life
                  of ease and pleasure, presided at the lower end of the board, upon the flanks of
                  which sat a dozen gentlemen from the neighboring estates, among them Tom Willitts,
                  from the adjoining farm, and Dick Newton, the major's only son.</p>
               <p>The conversation languished somewhat. The major was as gloomy as he had been
                  earlier in the day. Dick seemed to sympathize with his father. Tom Willitts was
                  impatient to have the drinking bout over, that he might go to the parlor, where
                  his thoughts already wandered, and where his <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >fiancée,</foreign> Mary Engle, the fair governess in the major's family,
                  awaited him. The guests at last began to be depressed by the want of spirits in
                  their host; and if it had not been for Doctor Ricketts, there would have been a
                  dull time indeed. But the doctor was talkative, lively and wholly indifferent to
                  the taciturnity of his companions. His weakness was a fondness for theorizing, and
                  he rattled on from topic to topic, heedless of anything but the portly <figure/>
                  <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6059-00000108"/> goblet which he replenished time and
                  again from the decanter and the punch-bowl.</p>
               <p>At last he exclaimed, in the hope of rousing his host from his apparent
                  despondency, "And now let's have a song from the major. Give us the 'Tally Ho!'
                  Newton."</p>
               <p>"I can't sing it to-day, gentlemen," said the major; "the fact is I am a good deal
                  out of sorts. I have met with a misfortune, and I—"</p>
               <p>"Why, what's happened?" exclaimed the whole company.</p>
               <p>"Why," said the major, with an oath, "I've lost my famous old diamond brooch—a
                  jewel, gentlemen, given to my father by George II.—a jewel that I valued more than
                  all the world beside. It was the reward given to my father for a brave and gallant
                  deed at the battle of Dettingen, and its rare intrinsic value was trifling beside
                  that which it possessed as the evidence of my father's valor."</p>
               <p>"How did you lose it, major?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"I went to my desk this morning, and found that the lock had been picked, the
                  inside drawer broken open and the brooch taken from its box."</p>
               <p>"Who could have done it?"</p>
               <p>"I can't imagine," replied the major; "I don't think any of those niggers would
                  have done such a thing. I've searched them all, but it's of no use, sir—no use;
                  it's gone. But if I ever lay hands on the scoundrel, I'll flay him alive—I will,
                  indeed, even if it should be Dick there;" and the old man gulped down a heavy
                  draught of port, as if to drown his grief.</p>
               <p>"My theory about such crimes," said the doctor, "is that the persons committing
                  them are always more or less insane."</p>
               <p>"Insane!" swore the major, fiercely. "If I catch the man who did this, I'll fit
                  him for a hospital!"</p>
               <p>"We are all a little daft at times—when we are angry, in love, in extreme want, or
                  excited by intense passion of any kind," said the doctor. "Extreme ignorance,
                  being neglect of one's intellectual faculties, is a kind of insanity, and so is
                  the perversion of the moral perceptions of those who are educated to a life of
                  crime from their childhood. My theory is that punishment should be so inflicted as
                  to restore reason, not merely to wreak vengeance."</p>
               <p>"And my theory is that every vagabond who breaks the laws ought to be flogged and
                  imprisoned, so that he may know that society will not tolerate crime. Hang your
                  fine-spun theories about the beggars who prey upon the community!" said the major,
                  rising and kicking back his chair ill-naturedly.</p>
               <p>The doctor had nothing more to say, and the company withdrew to the parlor.</p>
               <p>There, gathered around the great fireplace, sat Mrs. Newton, her daughters—both
                  children—Mary Engle, their tutor, Mrs. Willitts and the wives of the gentlemen who
                  had come from the dinner-table.</p>
               <p>They rose as the men entered the room, and greeted them cordially. Tom Willitts
                  went quickly to Mary's side, and while the others engaged in lively conversation
                  he took her hand gently and, as was their privilege, they walked slowly up the
                  room and sat by the window alone, Mary's face brightening as she thanked Tom
                  heartily for the beautiful present he had sent her the day before.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Why don't you wear it now, Mary?" asked Tom.</p>
               <p>"Do you want me to? I will get it and put it on, then, when I go to my room," said
                  Mary.</p>
               <p>Mary Engle was the daughter of a widow in humble circumstances<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000109"/> stances who lived in the village. Talented and
                  well-educated, she had determined no longer to be a burden upon her mother, but to
                  support herself. She had chosen to become a governess in Major Newton's family.
                  Young, beautiful and of good social position, she was a valuable acquisition to
                  that household, and was a universal favorite, although the major could never quite
                  rid himself of the notion that, as she was a dependant and an employé, he was
                  conferring a favor upon her by permitting such intimate relations to exist between
                  her and his family. But he treated her kindly, as all men must a pretty woman. She
                  was a girl with whom any man might have fallen in love upon first acquaintance.
                  Dick Newton loved her passionately before she had been in his father's house a
                  month. But she had chosen rather to favor Tom Willitts, a constant visitor at the
                  Newton mansion, and as fine a fellow as ever galloped across the country with the
                  hounds. Dick had not had time to propose before the game was up and Tom called the
                  prize his own. But Dick nursed his passion and smothered his disappointment, while
                  he swore that he would possess the girl or involve her and her lover in common
                  ruin with himself. Tom had been engaged for three months before this Christmas
                  day. He was to be married in the coming spring.</p>
               <p>There was to be a theatrical exhibition in the Newton mansion this Christmas
                  evening, in which the young people were to participate. A temporary stage had been
                  erected at one end of the long room, and at an early hour seats were placed in
                  front of the curtain, and the guests took their places, conversing with much
                  merriment and laughter until the bell gave the signal for the performance to
                  begin.</p>
               <p>It was a little play—a brief comedy of only tolerable merit, and it devolved upon
                  Mary Engle to enter first.</p>
               <p>She tripped in smiling, and began the recitation with a vivacity and spirit that
                  promised well for the excellence of her performance throughout. Upon her throat
                  she wore a diamond brooch which blazed and flashed in the glare of the
                  foot-lights.</p>
               <p>There was an exclamation of surprise on the part of the gentlemen present, and the
                  sound startled Mary. She paused and looked around her inquiringly. Just then Major
                  Newton caught sight of the brooch. With an ugly word upon his lips, he sprang from
                  his seat and jumped upon the stage.</p>
               <p>"Where did you get that?" he demanded, fiercely, pointing at the diamonds, his
                  hand trembling violently.</p>
               <p>There was absolute silence in the room as Mary, pale and calm, replied:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Why do you ask, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Where did you get that, I say? It was stolen from me. You are a thief!"</p>
               <p>In an instant she tore it from her dress and flung it upon the floor.</p>
               <p>The major leaped toward it and picked it up quickly.</p>
               <p>Mary covered her face with her hands, and the crimson of her cheeks shone through
                  her fingers.</p>
               <p>"Where did you get it?" again demanded the major.</p>
               <p>"I will not tell you, sir," said she, dragging down her hands with an effort and
                  clasping them in front of her.</p>
               <p>"Then leave this house this instant, and leave it for ever!" said the major, wild
                  with passion.</p>
               <p>Tom Willitts entered just as the last words were uttered. Mary seemed fainting. He
                  flew to her side as if to defend her against her enemy. He did not know the cause
                  of her trouble, but he glared at the major as if he could slay him.<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000110"/> But as he tried to place his arm around Mary, she
                  shrank away from him; and giving him one look of scorn and contempt and hatred,
                  she ran from the room.</p>
               <p>From the room to the great door in the hall, which, with frantic eagerness, she
                  flung open, and then, without any covering upon her fair head, hot with shame and
                  disgrace, and maddened with insult, she fled out into the cold and dark and
                  desolate winter's night.</p>
               <p>Scarcely heeding the direction, she reached the river's shore; and choosing the
                  hard sand for a pathway, she hurried along it. The tide swept up in ceaseless
                  ripples at her feet, the waves breaking upon the icy fringe of the shore, each
                  with a whisper that seemed to tell of her dishonor. The wind rustled the sedges
                  upon the banks and filled them with voices that mocked her. The stars that lighted
                  her upon her mad journey twinkled through the frosty air with an intelligence they
                  had never before possessed. The lights, far out upon the river and in the distant
                  town, danced up and down in the darkness as if beckoning her to come on to them
                  and to destruction.</p>
               <p>Her brain was in a whirl. At first she felt an impulse to end her misery in the
                  river. One plunge, and all this anguish and pain would be buried beneath those
                  restless waters. Then the hope of vindication flashed upon her mind, and the awful
                  sin and the cowardice of self-destruction rose vividly before her. She would seek
                  her home and the mother from whom she should never have gone out. She would give
                  up happiness and humanity, and hide herself from the cold, heartless world for
                  ever. She would have no more to do with false friends and false lovers, but would
                  shut herself away from all this deceit and treachery and unkindness, and nevermore
                  trust any human being but her own dear mother.</p>
               <p>And so, over the sandy beach, through mire and mud, through the high grass and the
                  reeds of the water's edge, tangled and dead, and full of peril in the darkness,
                  with her <figure/> hair disheveled and tossed about by the riotous wind, but with
                  not a tear upon her white face, she struggled onward through the night, until,
                  exhausted with her journey, her wild passion and her misery, she reached her
                  mother's house, and entering, clasped her arms about her mother's neck, and with a
                  sob fell fainting at her feet.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>There was an end to merriment at the Newton mansion. When Mary ran from the room,
                  the company stood for a moment amazed and bewildered, while the major, raging with
                  passion, yet half ashamed of his furious conduct, walked rapidly up and down the
                  stage, attempting to explain the theft to his guests and to justify his conduct.
                  But Tom Willitts, shocked at the cruel treatment he had received from Mary, yet
                  filled with righteous indignation at the major's violence, interrupted his first
                  utterance.</p>
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6059-00000111"/>
               <p>"You are a coward and a brute, sir; and old as you are, I will make you answer for
                  your infamous treatment of that young girl."</p>
               <p>And before the major could reply he dashed out to pursue Mary and give her his
                  protection. He sought her in vain upon the highway; and filled with bitterness,
                  and wondering why she had so scorned him, he trudged on through the darkness,
                  peering about him vainly for the poor girl for whom he would have sacrificed his
                  life.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it was merely a jest," suggested Mrs. Willitts. "I think Mary wholly
                  incapable of theft. She never could have intended seriously to keep the
                  brooch."</p>
               <p>"A pretty serious jest," said the major, "to break into my desk three days ago.
                  It's the kind of humor that puts people in jail."</p>
               <p>"My theory about the matter," said the doctor, "is this: She either was made the
                  victim of a pretty ugly practical joke, or else some one stole the jewel from you
                  and gave it to her to get her into trouble."</p>
               <p>"I don't believe anything of the kind," said the major.</p>
               <p>"It must be so. If she had stolen it, she certainly would not have worn it in your
                  presence this evening. It is absurd to suppose such a thing. Taking this
                  theory—"</p>
               <p>"Hang theorizing!" exclaimed the major, seeing the force of this suggestion, but
                  more angry that he was driven to admit it to his own mind. "She is a thief, and as
                  sure as I live she shall either confess, tell how she got the jewel or go to
                  prison."</p>
               <p>"And as sure as I live," said the doctor, grown indignant and serious, "I will
                  unravel this mystery and clear this innocent girl of this most infamous and wicked
                  imputation."</p>
               <p>"Do it if you can!" said the major, and turned his back upon him
                  contemptuously.</p>
               <p>The doctor left the house, and the company dispersed, eager gossips, all of them,
                  to tell the story far and wide throughout the community before to-morrow's
                  noon.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>When Mary had revived and told, in broken words, the story of her misery and
                  disgrace, her mother soothed and comforted her with the assurance that she should
                  never leave her again; and while she denounced Major Newton's conduct bitterly,
                  she said he would find that he had made a mistake and would clear her of the
                  charge.</p>
               <p>"But he will not find it out, mother."</p>
               <p>"Why? Where did you get the brooch, Mary?"</p>
               <p>"Do not ask me, mother; I cannot, cannot tell you."</p>
               <p>"Had you merely picked it up and put it on in jest?"</p>
               <p>"No, no," said Mary, "it was given to me, I cannot tell by whom, and I thought it
                  was mine. It was cruel, cruel!" and her tears came again.</p>
               <p>"And who was it that did so vile a thing?" asked her mother.</p>
               <p>"Mother, I cannot tell even you that."</p>
               <p>"But, Mary, this is foolish. You must not, for your own sake, for mine, hide the
                  name of this criminal."</p>
               <p>"I will never, never tell. I will die first."</p>
               <p>"Was it Tom Willitts?"</p>
               <p>"You must not question me, mother," said Mary, firmly. "If the person who betrayed
                  me is cowardly enough to place me in such a position, and then to stand coldly by
                  and witness my shame, I am brave enough and true enough to bear the burden. I
                  would rather have this misery than his conscience."</p>
               <p>Tom Willitts knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>"If it is Tom Willitts, mother," said Mary, rising, "tell him I will not see him.
                  Tell him never to come to this house again. Tell him," she said, her eyes glowing
                  with excitement, and stamping her foot upon the floor, "tell him I<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000112"/> hate him—hate him for a false, mean villain!" and
                  she fell back upon the chair in a wild passion of tears.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Engle met Tom at the door. He was filled with anxiety and terror, but he
                  rejoiced that Mary was safe. Mrs. Engle told him that Mary refused to see him. He
                  was smitten with anguish, and begged for a single word with her.</p>
               <p>"Do you know anything about this wicked business, Mr. Willitts?" asked Mrs. Engle,
                  suspicious, because of Mary's words, that Tom was the criminal.</p>
               <p>"Upon my honor I do not. I heard Major Newton's language, and saw the brooch upon
                  the floor; and when Mary fled from me, I pursued her, wondering what it all
                  meant."</p>
               <p>"She evidently suspects you of having been the cause of the trouble. Prove that
                  you were not. Until then she will not see you. I beg you, for yourself and her, to
                  tell the truth about this, if you know it, or at least to persist till you
                  discover it.</p>
               <p>Tom went away distressed and confounded. She suspected him. No wonder, then, she
                  had spurned him so rudely. He thought the matter over, and could arrive at no
                  solution of the difficulty. He had sent her a bracelet which she had promised to
                  wear, but she had not worn it. It was impossible that this brooch could have been
                  substituted. No, his own servant had given it to her, and brought her thanks in
                  return. Besides, who could be base enough to play such a dastardly trick upon a
                  pretty young girl? He could not master the situation; and in his trouble he went
                  the next morning to Dr. Ricketts.</p>
               <p>The doctor was equally puzzled, but he was certain that there was foul play
                  somewhere. He had pledged himself to unravel the mystery, and he began the work by
                  visiting Mary. Alone, he went to her house. He found it in strange commotion. Mrs.
                  Engle was sitting upon the sofa, crying bitterly; Mary, with pale, sad face, but
                  with an air of determination, confronted an obsequious man, who, with many
                  apologies and a manner that proved that he was ashamed of his business, extended a
                  paper toward her, and requested her to accompany him.</p>
               <p>It was a constable with a warrant for her arrest.</p>
               <p>Nearly five weary months were to pass before the cruel time of the trial. Dr.
                  Ricketts busied himself examining every one who could possibly have been connected
                  with the affair of the brooch, but with no result but a deeper mystery. Tom's
                  servant swore that he had given the bracelet into Mary's own hand. Two of the
                  house servants at Major Newton's were present at the time, and they were certain
                  the package was not broken. Mary's thimble had been found under the broken desk in
                  which the brooch was kept, and the housemaid had discovered a chisel secreted
                  behind some books in the bookcase in her room.</p>
               <p>The evidence, slight though it was, pointed to Mary as the criminal, despite the
                  absurdity of the supposition, in view of the manner in which she had worn the
                  jewel. Mary herself preserved an obstinate silence, refusing to tell how or where
                  or from whom she procured the fatal brooch. The doctor was bewildered and
                  confounded, and he at last gave up his inquiries in despair, hoping for a gracious
                  verdict from the jury at the trial.</p>
               <p>Through all the weary time Mary kept closely at home, secluded from friends and
                  acquaintances. Indeed, visitors were few in number now. She was in humble
                  circumstances, and she was in disgrace. Society always accounts its members guilty
                  until their innocence is proved. There were people in the town who had been
                  jealous of her beauty, her popularity, her place in the affections of rich Tom
                  Willitts, and these did not hesitate to hint, with a sneer, that<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000113"/> they had always doubted the reported excellence of
                  Mary Engle, and to assert their belief in her guilt.</p>
               <p>Tom Willitts was nearly crazed about her treatment of him and the ignominy that
                  was heaped upon her. With Dr. Ricketts and Dick Newton, who professed intense
                  anxiety to help solve the matter, he strove valiantly to clear her of the charge,
                  but without avail.</p>
               <p>The day of the trial came. The court-room was crowded. Able lawyers on both sides
                  sparred with each other, as able lawyers do, but the heart of the prosecuting
                  attorney was evidently not with his work. His duty was clear, however, and the
                  evidence was overwhelming. The defence had nothing to offer but Mary's good
                  character and her appearance before the company with the brooch upon her
                  person.</p>
               <p>The judge was compelled to instruct the jury against the prisoner. An hour of
                  anxious suspense, and they returned a verdict of "guilty."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Engle began to sob violently. Mary drew her veil aside from a face that was
                  ashen white, but not a muscle quivered until the judge pronounced the
                  sentence:</p>
               <p>"Costs of prosecution, a fine of one hundred dollars, twenty lashes upon the bare
                  back on the Saturday following, and imprisonment for one year."</p>
               <p>Mary fell to the floor insensible, and Dr. Ricketts, raising her in his arms,
                  applied restoratives. She was removed to the jail to await her punishment.</p>
               <p>The doctor mounted his horse and sped away in hot haste forty miles to Dover. He
                  had influence with the governor. He would procure a pardon, and then have Mary
                  taken away from the scene of her tribulation—where her suffering and disgrace
                  would be forgotten, and she would be at peace. He was unsuccessful. The governor
                  was a just, not a merciful, man. The law had been outraged. Twelve good men and
                  true had said so. If people committed crimes, they must submit to the penalty.
                  Society must be protected. The intelligence and social position of the criminal
                  only made the demands of justice more imperative. If he pardoned Mary Engle, men
                  would rightly say that the poor and friendless and weak were punished, while the
                  influential and rich escaped the law. He must do his duty to Delaware and to her
                  people. He could not grant the pardon.</p>
               <p>But there was to be another appeal to executive mercy. It was the night before the
                  punishment. The doctor sat in his parlor, before the glowing fire in the grate,
                  and with his head resting upon his hand he thought sadly of the pitiful scene he
                  had witnessed in the jail from which he had just come—of Mary, in the damp, narrow
                  cell, bearing herself like a heroine through all this terrible trial, and still
                  keeping a secret which the doctor felt certain would give her back her freedom and
                  her good name if it could be disclosed; of Mrs. Engle, full of despair and terror,
                  crying bitterly over the shame and disgrace that had come upon her child, and
                  which would be increased beyond endurance on the morrow.</p>
               <p>As the doctor's kind old heart grew heavy with these thoughts, and from the
                  bewildering maze of circumstances he tried to evolve some theory that promised
                  salvation, Dick Newton entered.</p>
               <p>He was haggard and pale, and his eyes were cast down to the floor.</p>
               <p>"Why, Dick, what's the matter?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Dr. Ricketts, I have come to make a shameful confession. I—"</p>
               <p>"Well?" said the doctor, suspiciously and impatiently, as Dick's voice
                  faltered.</p>
               <p>"I will not hesitate about it," said Dick, hurriedly; "I am afraid it is even now
                  too late. I stole the diamond brooch."</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6059-00000114"/>
               <p>"What?" exclaimed the doctor, jumping to his feet in a frenzy of indignant
                  excitement.</p>
               <p>"I am the cause of all this trouble. It was my fault that Mary Engle was accused
                  and convicted, and it will be my fault if she is punished. Oh, doctor, cannot
                  something be done to save her? I never intended it should go so far."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"You infamous scoundrel!" said the doctor, unable to restrain his scorn and
                  contempt; "why did you not say this before? Why did you permit all this misery and
                  shame to fall upon the defenceless head of a woman for whom an honest man should
                  have sacrificed his very life? How was this villainy consummated? Tell me,
                  quickly!"</p>
               <p>The poor wretch sank upon his knees, and with a trembling voice exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"I loved her. I hated Tom Willitts. He sent her a bracelet. I knew it would come.
                  I broke open father's cabinet and took his brooch. With threats and money I
                  induced Tom's servant to lend me the box for a few moments before he entered the
                  house. I placed the brooch in it. She thought it came from Tom, and she resolved
                  to die rather than betray him, although she thinks him the cause of her ruin. It
                  was vile and mean and wicked in me, but I thought Tom would be the victim, not
                  she; and when the trouble came, I could not endure the shame of exposure. But you
                  will save her now, doctor, will you not? I will fly—leave the country—kill
                  myself—anything to prevent this awful crime."</p>
               <p>The miserable man burst into tears. Dr. Ricketts looked at him a moment with eyes
                  filled with pity and scorn, and then said,</p>
               <p>"So my theory was right, after all. Come, sir, you will go to the governor with
                  me, and we will see if he will grant a pardon upon your confession."</p>
               <p>"What, to-night?" asked Dick.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to-night—now; and it will be well for you and your victim if fleet horses
                  carry us to Dover and back before ten to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>In five minutes the pair were seated in a carriage, and through the black night
                  they sped onward, the one with his heart swelling with hope, joy and humanity, the
                  other cowering in the darkness, full of misery and self-contempt, and of horrible
                  forebodings of the future.</p>

               <p>Saturday morning—a cold, raw, gusty morning in May.</p>
               <p>The town was in a small uproar. Men lounged on the porches of the taverns, in
                  front of which their horses were hitched, talking politics, discussing crop
                  prospects, the prices of grain, the latest news by coach and schooner from
                  Philadelphia. Inside the bar-room men were reading newspapers a month old,
                  drinking, swearing and debating with loud voices.</p>
               <p>But the attraction that morning was in another quarter. In the middle of the
                  market street there was a common—a strip of green sod twenty feet wide fringed on
                  either side with a row of trees. In the centre of this stood the whipping-post and
                  pillory.</p>
               <p>The hour of ten tolled out from the steeple down the street. It was the same bell
                  that called the people together on Sunday to worship God and to supplicate his
                  mercy. It<pb n="228-229 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6059-00000115"/> was a bell of
                  various uses. It summoned the saints to prayer and the sinners to punishment.</p>
               <p>At its earliest stroke the jailer issued from the prison with a forlorn-looking
                  white man in his clutches. He hurried his prisoner up the ladder, and prepared to
                  fasten him in the pillory. The boys below collected in knots, and fingered the
                  missiles in their hands. The jailer descended. A boy lifted his hand and flung a
                  rotten egg at the pilloried wretch. It hit him squarely in the face, and the
                  feculent contents streamed down to his chin. That was the signal. Eggs, dead cats,
                  mud, stones, tufts of sod and a multitude of filthy things were showered upon the
                  prisoner, until the platform was covered with the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >débris.</foreign> He yelled with pain, and strove vainly to shake from his
                  face the blood that streamed forth from the cut skin and the filth that besmeared
                  it. The crowd hooted at him and laughed at his efforts, and called him vile names,
                  and jested with him about his wooden collar and cuffs, and no human heart in all
                  that assembly had any pity for him. For an hour he stood there, enduring
                  inconceivable torture. When the steeple clock struck eleven, he was taken out in
                  wretched plight, almost helpless and sorely wounded. No more pillory that day. It
                  was the turn of the whipping-post now. There were two women to be whipped, one of
                  them white, the other black. We know who the white woman was.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The negro was to suffer first. She was dragged from the jail wild with fright and
                  apprehension. Around her legs a soiled skirt of calico dangled. About her naked
                  body, stripped for the sacrifice, a fragment of carpet was hung. The jailer
                  brought her by main force to the post through the jeering crowd, and while she
                  begged wildly, almost incoherently, for mercy, promising vague, impossible things,
                  the officer of the law clasped the iron cuffs about her uplifted hands, so that<figure>

                  <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6059-00000116"/> she was compelled to stand upon her
                  toes to escape unendurable agony. The blanket was torn from her shoulders, and
                  with dilated eyes glistening with terror, she turned her head half around to where
                  the sheriff stood, ready to execute the law.</p>
               <p>This virtuous officer felt the sharp thongs of his "cat" complacently as he
                  listened with dull ear to the incessant prayers of the woman; and when the jailer
                  said, "Forty lashes, sheriff," the cat was swung slowly up, and the ends of the
                  lashes touched the victim's back, bringing blood at the first blow.</p>
               <p>The crowd laughed and applauded. The sheriff accepted the applause with the calm
                  indifference of a man who feels the greatness of his office and has confidence in
                  his own skill.</p>
               <p>As the lashes came thick and fast, the skin swelled up into thick purple ridges,
                  and then the blood spurted out in crimson streams, flowing down upon the wretched
                  skirt and staining it with a new and dreadful hue. The woman's piercing screams
                  rang out upon the air and filled some kind hearts with tender pity. But as it was
                  a "nigger," the tendency to human kindness was smothered.</p>
               <p>Beneath the blows she writhed and contorted and shrank forward, until at last,
                  faint with loss of blood, with terrible pain and nervous exhaustion, she sank
                  helplessly down and hung by her arms alone. At first the sheriff thought he would
                  postpone the rest of the punishment until she recovered. But there were only five
                  more lashes to be given, and he concluded that it would be as well to finish up
                  the job. They were inflicted upon the insensible form, and then the jailer came
                  forward with a pair of shears. The sheriff took them coolly and clipped away a
                  portion of the woman's ears. Her hands were then unshackled; and bleeding,
                  mutilated, unconscious, she was carried into the prison.</p>
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6059-00000117"/>
               <p>Her agonized cries had penetrated those walls already and brought a whiter hue to
                  the pale cheeks of the woman who by this ignominy had learned her sisterhood with
                  the poor black. There were two other women in the cell, Mrs. Engle and Mrs.
                  Willitts. The former controlled herself for her daughter's sake, but dared speak
                  no word to her. Mrs. Willitts, through her tears, tried to comfort Mary as with
                  hesitating hands she disrobed her for her torture:</p>
               <p>"The day will come, Mary dear, when you will be vindicated, and these wicked men
                  will hide their heads with bitter shame and humiliation. But bear up bravely,
                  dear. Have good courage through it all. Perhaps it will not be so hard. 'Though
                  there be heaviness for a night, joy cometh in the morning.' We will all be happy
                  together yet some day."</p>
               <p>Mary Engle stood there, speechless, statue-like, immovable, as they took away her
                  garments, and her fair white skin glistened in the dim light.</p>
               <p>It was almost time. The black woman was being dragged through the door to the next
                  cell. The murmur of the crowd came up from the street. Mrs. Willitts placed the
                  blanket upon those ivory shoulders, and Mary, turning to her mother, flung her
                  arms about her and kissed her. In a whisper she said,</p>
               <p>"I shall die, mother. I will not live through it. I will never see you again."</p>
               <p>But there was not a tear in her eye. Wrapping the blanket tightly about her, with
                  the calmness of despair she prepared to step from the cell at the call of the
                  impatient jailer.</p>
               <p>A great commotion in the streets. The noise of horse's hoofs. A din of voices;
                  then a wild cheer.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ricketts dashed in, flourishing a paper in his hand.</p>
               <p>"She is pardoned! pardoned!" he shouted; "go back! take her back!" he said as the
                  jailer laid his hand upon Mary. "See this!" and he flung the paper open in his
                  face.</p>
               <p>The long agony was over, and the reaction was so great that Mary Engle, hardly
                  conscious of the good thing that had happened to her, and not fully realizing the
                  events by which her innocence was proved, stood stupefied and bewil <figure/>
                  dered. Then she felt faint, and laying her upon the low bed, they told her all the
                  story; and when the doctor said that Tom was not a guilty man, she turned her face
                  to the wall to hide the blinding tears, and she muttered:</p>
               <p>"Thank God! thank God for that!"</p>
               <p>As she came out of the prison doors, leaning on the doctor's arm, the crowd, now
                  largely increased, hailed her with a hurrah, but Mary drew her veil over her face
                  and shuddered as she thought how these very people had assembled to see her
                  flogged.</p>
               <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6059-00000118"/>
               <p>"It is my theory, my dear," said the doctor, "that human beings are equally glad
                  when their fellow-creatures get into trouble and when they get out of it."</p>
               <p>Back once again in her old home, Mary was besieged by friends whose regard had
                  suddenly assumed a violent form, and who were now eager to congratulate her upon
                  her vindication.</p>
               <p>Tom Willitts came to the door and inquired for Mrs. Engle.</p>
               <p>"Can I come in now?" he inquired, with a glow upon his face.</p>
               <p>He did go in, and there, before them all, he clasped Mary in his arms, while she
                  begged him to forgive her for all the suffering she had caused him.</p>
               <p>But Tom wanted to be forgiven, too; and as both confessed guilt, repentance and an
                  earnest wish to be merciful, they were soon better friends than ever.</p>
               <p>"I used to love you," said Tom, "but now I worship you for your heroism and your
                  sacrifice for me."</p>
               <p>There was another visitor. Old Major Newton entered the room, hat in hand, and
                  with bowed head. The lines in his face were deeper and harder than usual, but he
                  looked broken and sad.</p>
               <p>He went up to Mary and said as he stood before her with downcast eyes:</p>
               <p>"I have come to ask pardon for my brutality and cruelty. The injury I did to you I
                  can never atone for. I shall carry my remorse to the grave. But if you have any
                  word of pity for an old man whose son has fled from home a scoundrel and a
                  villain, and who stands before you broken-hearted, ready to kiss your feet for
                  your angelic goodness and your noble self-sacrifice, say it, that I may at least
                  have that comfort in my desolation."</p>
               <p>And Mary took the old man's hard hands in hers and spoke kind and gentle words to
                  him; and with tears coursing down his rough cheeks, he kissed her dainty fingers
                  and went out, and back to his forlorn and wretched home.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>There was another Christmas night a few months later, and this time the
                  merry-making was going on in the Willitts mansion. There were two brides there.
                  Mary and Tom Willitts were busy helping the children with their Christmas games,
                  and keeping up the excitement as if no sorrow had ever come across their path;
                  while seated at the upper end of the room, Dr. Ricketts and his wife (Mrs. Engle
                  that had been), looking upon the younger pair with pride and pleasure, touched
                  only now and then with a sad memory of the troubled times that were gone by for
                  ever.</p>
               <p>And when the games were all in full progress, Tom and his wife watched them for a
                  while, and then he drew her arm through his, and they went to the porch and looked
                  out upon the river beating up against the ice-bound shore, just as it did on that
                  night one year ago. But it had a different language to Mary's ears now. It was
                  full of music, but music that seemed in a minor key, as the remembrance of that
                  wild flight along the shore came up vividly in her mind.</p>
               <p>Neither spoke for a while, but each knew that the thoughts of the other went over
                  all the misery and terror of the past, only to rest satisfied with the calm, sweet
                  happiness of the present. Mary, clasping her husband's arm tighter in her grasp,
                  looked with unconscious eyes out over the broad river, while her lips slowly
                  repeated that grand old hymn of comfort and hope:<pb n="236-237"

               <p>LAST evening, after waiting until eleven o'clock for Mr. Parker to come home, I
                  went to bed. I had hardly composed myself for slumber when I thought I heard the
                  door-bell ring; and supposing Bob had forgotten his latch-key, I descended for the
                  purpose of letting him in. When I opened the door, no one was upon the porch; and
                  although I was dressed simply in a night-shirt, I stepped out just beyond the
                  doorway for the purpose of ascertaining if I could see any one who might have
                  pulled the bell. Just as I did so the wind banged the door shut, and as it closed
                  it caught a portion of my raiment which was fluttering about, and held it fast. I
                  was somewhat amused at first, and I laughed as I tried to pull the muslin from the
                  door; but after making very violent exertion for that purpose, I<pb n="238-239"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000120"/> discovered that the material would not slip
                  through. The garment was held so firmly that it could not possibly be removed.
                  Then I determined to reach over to the other side of the doorway and pull the
                  bell, in the hope that some one would hear it and come to my assistance. But to my
                  dismay I found that the doorway was so wide that even with the most desperate
                  effort I could not succeed in touching the bell-knob with the tips of my
                  fingers.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Meantime, I was beginning to freeze, for the night was very cold, and my legs and
                  feet were wholly unprotected.</p>
               <p>At last a happy thought struck me. I might very easily creep out of the shirt and
                  leave it hanging in the door until I rang the bell, and then I could slip back
                  again and await the result. Accordingly, I began to withdraw from the garment, and
                  I had just freed myself from it and was about to pull the bell when I heard some
                  one coming down the street. As the moon was shining brightly, I became
                  panic-stricken, and hurried into the garment again. In my confusion I got
                  <figure/> it on backward, and found myself with my face to the wall; and then the
                  person who was coming turned down the street just above my house, and didn't pass,
                  after all.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I was afraid to try the experiment again, and I determined to shout for help. I
                  uttered one cry, and waited for a response. It was a desperately cold night. I
                  think the air must have been colder than it ever was before in the history of this
                  continent. I stamped my feet in order to keep the blood in circulation, and then I
                  shouted again for assistance. The river lay white and glistening in the light of
                  the moon, and so clear was the atmosphere, so lustrous the radiance of the orb
                  above, that I could plainly distinguish the dark line of the Jersey shore. It was
                  a magnificent spectacle, and I should have enjoyed it intensely if I had had my
                  clothing on. Then I began to think how very odd it was that a man's appreciation
                  of the glorious majesty of nature should be dependent upon his trousers! how
                  strange it was that cold legs should prevent an immortal soul from having
                  felicity! Man is always prosaic when he is uncomfortable. Even a slight
                  indigestion is utterly destructive of sentiment. I defy any man <figure/>
                  <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6059-00000121"/> to enjoy the fruitiest poetry while
                  his corns hurt him, or to feel a genuine impulse of affection while he has a
                  severe cold in his head.</p>
               <p>Then I cried aloud again for help, and an immediate response came from Cooley's
                  new dog, which leaped over the fence and behaved as if it meditated an assault
                  upon my defenceless calves. I was relieved from this dreadful situation by Bob,
                  who came up the street whistling and singing in an especially joyous manner. He
                  was a little frightened, I think, when he saw a figure in white upon the porch,
                  and he paused for a moment before opening the gate, but he entered when I called
                  to him; and unlocking the door with his key, he released me, and went up stairs
                  laughing heartily at my mishap.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I was about to retire when I heard a series of extraordinary sounds in Bob's room
                  overhead, and I thought it worth while to go up and ascertain what was going on.
                  Standing outside the door, I could hear Bob chuckling and making use of such
                  exclamations as,</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Bul-l-<emph>e-e-e!</emph> Ha! ha! All right, my boy! All right! You've fixed
                  that, I guess! Bul-l-<emph>e-e-e-e-e!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Then he seemed to be executing a hornpipe in his stockings upon the carpet; and
                  when this exercise was concluded, he continued the conversation with himself in
                  such tones as these:</p>
               <p>"How <emph>are</emph> YOU, Smiley! No chance, hadn't I? Couldn't make it, couldn't
                  I? I know a thing or two, I reckon. How <emph>are</emph> YOU, Lieutenant
                     Smil-<emph>e-e-e-e!</emph> Ha! ha! I've settled your case, I guess, my boy!
                  Bully for you, Parker! You've straightened that out, anyhow. Yes, sir! Ha! ha! Fol
                  de rol de rol de rol," etc., etc. (second performance of the hornpipe, accompanied
                  by whistling and new expressions of intense satisfaction).</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I went down stairs with a solemn conviction that Mr. Parker had explained himself
                  to Miss Magruder, and had received an answer from her that was wholly
                  satisfactory. I did not reveal the secret to Mrs. Adeler, concluding that it would
                  be better to permit Bob to do that himself in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Parker rose about two hours earlier than usual, and I entertain a suspicion that
                  he expended a portion of the time in going down the street to examine the exterior
                  of Mr. Magruder's house. It probably gave him some satisfaction merely to view the
                  tenement wherein his fair enslaver reposed. He came to the breakfast-table with a
                  radiant countenance, and it was evident that he would be unable to contain the
                  news for many moments longer. In order to prepare the way for him, I asked
                  him:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Why were you so late last night, Bob?"</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6059-00000122"/>
               <p>"Oh, I had some important business on hand. Big things have been happening; I have
                  some news to tell you."</p>
               <p>"Another railroad accident?" I asked, carelessly, "or a riot in Philadelphia?"</p>
               <p>"Riot? no! Thunder!" exclaimed Bob; "nothing of that kind. It's something more
                  important. You know old Smiley—Fiji Island Smiley? Well, I've floored him; I've
                  laid him out flat; I've knocked him into diminutive smithereens."</p>
               <p>"Had a personal encounter with the lieutenant?" I asked, gravely.</p>
               <p>"No, <emph>sir!</emph> better than that. I've cut him out down at Magruder's.
                  Bessie and I are engaged! What do you think of that, Max?"</p>
               <p>"Think of it? Why, I congratulate you heartily. You have secured a treasure."</p>
               <p>"And I congratulate you, too," said Mrs. A. "Bessie is a very fine girl, and will
                  make you a good wife."</p>
               <p>"That's what I think about it," observed Mr. Parker.</p>
               <p>"I am very glad Lieutenant Smiley didn't succeed there," said Mrs. A.</p>
               <p>"Smiley! Smiley!" exclaimed Bob, scornfully. "Why, he never had the ghost of a
                  chance. Bessie told me last night she despised him. She wouldn't look at such a
                  man as he is."</p>
               <p>"Not while such men as you are around, at any rate, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"When are you going to speak to Bessie's father?" asked Mrs. Adeler.</p>
               <p>A cloud suddenly passed over Bob's face, and he said:</p>
               <p>"I don't know. I have to do it, I s'pose, but I hate it worse than I can tell you.
                  I believe I'd rather propose to a woman a dozen times than to broach the matter to
                  a stern parent once. It's all well enough to express your feelings to a woman who
                  loves you; but when you come to explain the matter to a cold-blooded,
                  matter-of-fact old man who is as prosy as a boiled turnip, it seems kind of
                  ridiculous."</p>
               <p>"Why don't you speak to Mrs. Dr. Magruder, then? She is a power in that
                  family."</p>
               <p>"No; I'll talk to Mr. Magruder. It's hard, but it has to be done. And see here,
                  Max, don't you poke fun at Mrs. Magruder. She's a first-rate woman, and those
                  things Dr. Jones told about her are the most rascally kind of lies. If you'll
                  excuse me, I'll go down and see the old man now. I might as well settle the thing
                  at once."</p>
               <p>This evening, while we were waiting for tea, Bob made a report. The paternal
                  Magruder, it seems, had already considered the subject carefully, and was not by
                  any means as much surprised by Mr. Parker's statement as the latter expected he
                  would be. Bob was amazed to find that although the old gentleman during the
                  courtship had appeared wholly unconscious of the fact that his daughter was
                  particularly intimate with the youth, yet somehow he seemed now to have had all
                  the time a very clear perception of the state of the case.</p>
               <p>"I thought he would get excited and, maybe, show a little emotion," said Bob, "but
                  blame me if he didn't sit there and take it as coolly as if such things happened
                  to him every day. And you know, when I began to tell him how much I thought of
                  Bessie, he soused down on me and brought me back to prose with a question about
                  the size of my income. But it's all right. He said he would be glad to have me a
                  member of his family, and then he called in Bessie, and gave us a kind of a
                  blessing and advised us not to be in a hurry about getting married."</p>
               <p>"Very good advice, too. There is no need of haste. You ought to have plenty of
                  time to think the matter over."</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6059-00000123"/>
               <p>"Think it over!" exclaimed Bob, indignantly. "Why, I <emph>have</emph> thought it
                  over. You don't suppose I'd be such a fool as to engage myself to a girl without
                  thinking seriously about it?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not; but marriage is a very solemn thing, and it should be undertaken
                  advisedly. It is probable, I suppose, that you would never, under any
                  circumstances, marry any woman but Bessie Magruder?"</p>
               <p>"Nev-er; no, never!"</p>
               <p>"You don't believe in second marriages, then?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not."</p>
               <p>"They <emph>do</emph> get a man into trouble very often. Did I ever tell you about
                  old Sparks, of Pencadder Hundred?"</p>
               <p>"I think not," said Bob.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Well, old Sparks was married four times; and several years after the death of his
                  last wife they started a new cemetery up there at Pencadder. Sparks bought a lot,
                  and determined to remove his sacred dust from the old graveyard. Somehow or other,
                  in taking the remains over to the cemetery in the wagon, they were hopelessly
                  mixed together, so that it was utterly impossible to tell which was which. Any
                  other man than Sparks would <figure/> simply have taken the chances of having the
                  reinterments properly made. But he was an extremely conscientious man; and when
                  the sepulture was completed, he had a lot of new headstones set in, bearing such
                  inscriptions as these: 'Here lies Jane (and probably part of Susan) Sparks;'
                  'Sacred to the memory of Maria (to say nothing of Jane and Hannah) Sparks.' <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Stranger, pause and drop a tear,</l>
                        <l>For Susan Sparks lies buried here;</l>
                        <l>Mingled, in some perplexing manner,</l>
                        <l>With Jane, Maria and portions of Hannah.'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Don't it seem a little bit rough," said Bob, "to bring in such a story as that in
                  connection with my engagement? I don't like it."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Bob. Perhaps it was neither gracious nor in good taste, but somehow I
                  just happened to think of old Sparks at that moment. I am sure, though, you won't
                  object to another narrative which I am going to read to you upon the subject of
                  too frequent marriage. It is the story of Bishop Potts. Do you feel like hearing
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Well, no," said Bob, gloomily, "to tell you the truth, I don't; but I suppose I
                  will have to hear it, so go ahead."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am going to inflict it upon you whether you want it or not. A man who is
                  meditating matrimony, and is in a hurry, needs the influence of a few 'awful
                  examples' to induce him to proceed slowly. Here is the story. The hero was a
                  dignitary in the Mormon Church, and his sufferings were the result of excessive
                  marriage. The tale is entitled</p>

                  <head>BISHOP POTTS.</head>
                  <p>"Bishop Potts, of Salt Lake City, was the husband of three wives and the father
                     of fifteen interesting children.<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6059-00000124"/>
                     Early in the winter the bishop determined that his little ones should have a
                     good time on Christmas, so he concluded to take a trip down to San Francisco to
                     see what he could find in the shape of toys with which to gratify and amuse
                     them. The good bishop packed his carpetbag, embraced Mrs. Potts one by one and
                     kissed each of her affectionately, and started upon his journey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"He was gone a little more than a week, when he came back with fifteen brass
                     trumpets in his valise for his darlings. He got out of the train at Salt Lake,
                     thinking how joyous it would be at home on Christmas morning when the fifteen
                     trumpets should be in operation upon different tunes at the same moment. But
                     just as he entered the dépôt he saw a group of women standing in the ladies'
                     room apparently waiting for him. As soon as he approached, the whole twenty of
                     them rushed up, threw their arms about his neck and kissed him, exclaiming:</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"'Oh, Theodore, we are so, <emph>so</emph> glad you have come back! Welcome
                     home! Welcome, dear Theodore, to the bosom of your family!' and then the entire
                     score of them fell upon his neck and cried over his shirt front and mussed
                     him.</p>
                  <p>"The bishop seemed surprised and embarrassed. Struggling to disengage himself,
                     he blushed and said:</p>
                  <p>"'Really, ladies, this kind of thing is well enough—it is interesting and all
                     that; but there must be some kind of a—that is, an awkward sort of a—excuse me,
                     ladies, but there seems to be, as it were, a slight misunderstanding about
                     the—I am Bishop Potts.'</p>
                  <p>"'We know it, we know it, dear,' they exclaimed, in chorus, 'and we are glad to
                     see you safe at home. We have all been very well while you were away,
                     love.'</p>
                  <p>"'It gratifies me,' remarked the bishop, 'to learn that none of you have been a
                     prey to disease. I am filled with serenity when I contemplate the fact; but
                     really, I do not understand why you should rush into this railway station and
                     hug me because your livers are active and your digestion good. The precedent is
                     bad; it is dangerous!'</p>
                  <p>"'Oh, but we didn't!' they exclaimed, in chorus. 'We came here to welcome you
                     because you are our husband.'</p>
                  <p>"'Pardon me, but there must be some little—that is to say, as it were, I should
                     think not. Women, you have mistaken your man!'</p>
                  <p>"'Oh no!' they shouted; 'we were married to you while you were away!'</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"'What!' exclaimed the bishop; 'you don't mean to say that—'</p>
                  <p>"'Yes, love. Our husband, William Brown, died on Monday, and on Thursday,
                     Brigham had a vision in which he was directed to seal us to you; and so he
                     performed the ceremony at once by proxy.'</p>
                  <p>"'Th-th-th-th-under!' observed the bishop.</p>
                  <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6059-00000125"/>
                  <p>"'And we are all living with you now—we and the dear children.'</p>
                  <p>"'Children! children!' exclaimed Bishop Potts, turning pale; 'you don't mean to
                     say that there is a pack of children, too?'</p>
                  <p>"'Yes, love, but only one hundred and twenty-five, not counting the eight twins
                     and the triplet.'</p>
                  <p>"'Wha-wha-wha-what d'you say?' gasped the bishop, in a cold perspiration; 'one
                     hundred and twenty-five! One hundred and twenty-five children and twenty more
                     wives! It is too much—it is awful!' and the bishop sat down and groaned, while
                     the late Mrs. Brown, the bride, stood around in a semicircle and fanned him
                     with her bonnets, all except the red-haired one, and she in her trepidation
                     made a futile effort to fan him with the coal-scuttle.</p>
                  <p>"But after a while the bishop became reconciled to his new alliance, knowing
                     well that protests would be unavailing, so he walked home, holding several of
                     the little hands of the bride, while the red-haired woman carried his umbrella
                     <figure/> and marched in front of the parade to remove obstructions and to
                     scare off small boys.</p>
                  <p>"When the bishop reached the house, he went around among the cradles which
                     filled the back parlor and the two second-story rooms, and attempted with such
                     earnestness to become acquainted with his new sons and daughters that he set
                     the whole one hundred and twenty-five and the twins to crying, while his own
                     original fifteen stood around and swelled the volume of sound. Then the bishop
                     went out and sat on the garden fence to whittle a stick and solemnly think,
                     while Mrs. Potts distributed herself around and soothed the children. It
                     occurred to the bishop while he mused, out there on the fence, that he had not
                     enough trumpets to go around among the children as the family now stood; and
                     so, rather than seem to be partial, he determined to go back to San Francisco
                     for one hundred and forty-four more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"So the bishop repacked his carpet-bag, and began again to bid farewell to his
                     family. He tenderly kissed all of the Mrs. Potts who were at home, and started
                     for the dépôt, while Mrs. Potts stood at the various windows and waved her
                     handkerchiefs at him—all except the woman with the warm hair, and she, in a fit
                     of absent-mindedness, held one of the twins by the leg and brandished it at
                     Potts as he fled down the street toward the railway station.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"The bishop reached San Francisco, completed his purchases, and was just about
                     to get on the train with his one hundred and forty-four trumpets, when a
                     telegram was handed him. It contained information to the effect that the
                     auburn-haired Mrs. Potts had just had a daughter. This induced the bishop to
                     return to the city for the purpose of purchasing an additional trumpet.</p>
                  <p>"On the following Saturday he returned home. As he approached his house a swarm
                     of young children flew out of the front gate and ran toward him, shouting,
                     'There's pa!<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6059-00000126"/> Here comes pa! Oh, pa,
                     but we're glad to see you! Hurrah for pa!' etc., etc.</p>
                  <p>"The bishop looked at the children as they flocked around him and clung to his
                     legs and coat, and was astonished to perceive that they were neither his nor
                     the late Brown's. He said, 'You youngsters have made a mistake; I am not your
                     father;' and the bishop smiled good-naturedly.</p>
                  <p>"'Oh yes, you are, though!' screamed the little ones, in chorus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"'But I say I am not,' said the bishop, severely, and frowning; 'you ought to
                     be ashamed of yourselves. Don't you know where little story-tellers go? It is
                     scandalous for you to violate the truth in this manner. My name is Potts.'</p>
                  <p>"'Yes, we know it is,' exclaimed the children—'we know it is, and so is ours;
                     that is our name now, too, since the wedding.'</p>
                  <p>"'Since what wedding?' demanded the bishop, turning pale.</p>
                  <p>"'Why, ma's wedding, of course. She was married yesterday to you by Mr. Young,
                     and we are all living at your house now with our new little brothers and
                     sisters.'</p>
                  <p>"The bishop sat down on the nearest front-door step and wiped away a tear. Then
                     he asked,</p>
                  <p>"'Who was your father?'</p>
                  <p>"'Mr. Simpson,' said the crowd, 'and he died on Tuesday.'</p>
                  <p>"'And how many of his infernal old widows—I mean how many of your mother—are
                     there?'</p>
                  <p>"'Only twenty-seven,' replied the children, 'and there are only sixty-four of
                     us, and we are awful glad you have come home.'</p>
                  <p>"The bishop did not seem to be unusually glad; somehow, he failed to share the
                     enthusiasm of the occasion. There appeared to be, in a certain sense, too much
                     sameness about these surprises; so he sat there with his hat pulled over his
                     eyes and considered the situation. Finally, seeing there was no help for it, he
                     went up to the house, and forty-eight of Mrs. Potts rushed up to him and told
                     him how the prophet had another vision, in which he was commanded to seal
                     Simpson's widow to Potts.</p>
                  <p>"Then the bishop stumbled around among the cradles to his writing-desk. He felt
                     among the gum rings and rattles for his letter-paper, and then he addressed a
                     note to Brigham, asking him as a personal favor to keep awake until after
                     Christmas. 'The man must take me for a foundling hospi<pb n="252-253"
                        xml:id="VAC6059-00000127"/> tal,' he said. Then the bishop saw clearly
                     enough that if he gave presents to the other children, and not to the late
                     Simpson's, the bride would make things warm for him. So he started again for
                     San Francisco for sixty-four more trumpets, while Mrs. Potts gradually took
                     leave of him in the entry—all but the red-haired woman, who was up stairs, and
                     who had to be satisfied with screeching good-bye at the top of her voice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"On his way home, after his last visit to San Francisco, the bishop sat in the
                     car by the side of a man who had left Salt Lake the day before. The stranger
                     was communicative. In the course of the conversation he remarked to the
                     bishop:</p>
                  <p>"'That was a mighty pretty little affair up there at the city on Monday.'</p>
                  <p>"'What affair?' asked Potts.</p>
                  <p>"'Why, that wedding; McGrath's widow, you know—married by proxy.'</p>
                  <p>"'You don't say?' replied the bishop. 'I didn't know McGrath was dead.'</p>
                  <p>"'Yes; died on Sunday, and that night Brigham had a vision in which he was
                     ordered to seal her to the bishop.'</p>
                  <p>"'Bishop!' exclaimed Potts. 'Bishop! What bishop?'</p>
                  <p>"'Well, you see, there were fifteen of Mrs. McGrath and eighty-two children,
                     and they shoved the whole lot off on old Potts. Perhaps you don't know
                     him?'</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bishop gave a wild shriek and writhed upon the floor as if he had a fit.
                     When he recovered, he leaped from the train and walked back to San Francisco.
                     He afterward took the first steamer for Peru, where he entered a monastery and
                     became a celibate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"His carpet-bag was sent on to his family. It contained the balance of the
                     trumpets. On Christmas morning they were distributed, and in less than an hour
                     the entire two hundred and eight children were sick from sucking the brass upon
                     them. A doctor was called, and he seemed so much interested in the family that
                     Brigham divorced the whole concern from old Potts and annexed it to the doctor,
                     who immediately lost his reason, and would have butchered the entire family if
                     the red-haired woman and the oldest boy had not marched him off to a lunatic
                     asylum, where he spent his time trying to arrive at an estimate of the number
                     of his children by ciphering with an impossible combination of the
                     multiplication table and algebra."</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>"And now that that's over," said Bob, as I folded up the manuscript, "will you
                     please to tell me what the suffering of old Potts has to do with my
                     engagement?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, to tell the truth, nothing in particular. I thought<pb n="254-255"
                        xml:id="VAC6059-00000128"/> perhaps you might feel a sort of general
                     interest in the mere subject of matrimony just now; and at any rate, I wanted
                     your opinion of the merit of the story."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I think it is a pretty poor story. The humor of the Mormon business is
                     stale, anyhow, and in your hands it becomes absolutely dismal. I can write a
                     better Mormon story than that myself, and I don't even profess to be a
                     scribbler."</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Parker swaggered out with the air of a man whose opinions have the
                     weight of a judicial decision. I think he has acquired, since his engagement, a
                     much greater notion of his importance than he had before. It is remarkable how
                     a youth who has succeeded in a love affair immediately begins to cherish the
                     idea that his victory is attributable to the fact that he possesses
                     particularly brilliant qualities of some kind. Bob was the humblest man in
                     Delaware a week ago; to-day he walks about with such an air as he might have
                     had if he had just won the battle of Waterloo.</p>

               <p>WHEN the people of our village are in the mood to reflect upon antiquity, when
                  they feel as if they would like to meditate upon the heroic deeds that have been
                  achieved in this kindly old place by the mighty men of valor who swaggered and
                  swore and fought here a hundred years before the war of the Revolution was dreamed
                  of, they turn from the street down the gentle slope of the highway which runs by
                  the river; and when they have wandered on a brief distance beyond the present
                  confines of the town, they reach old Fort Lane. It is but a little stretch of
                  greensward, gashed by the wheels of vehicles and trodden by the feet of wayfarers.
                  It extends from the road eastward for a hundred yards, and then it dips downward
                  and ends upon the sandy beach of the stream. Here, right upon the edge of the
                     water,<pb n="256-257 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6059-00000129"/> once stood
                  brave old Fort Kasimir, with its guns threatening destruction not only to
                  unfriendly vessels which sailed up the bay, but absolutely menacing the very town
                  itself. The village then was called New Stockholm. That was the name given to it
                  by the Swedes, who perceived what a superb site for a city lay here, and who went
                  to work and built a swarm of snug wooden houses. It has had half a dozen other
                  names since. When the Dutchmen conquered it, they dubbed it Sandhoec, then New
                  Amstel and then Fort Kasimir. After-ward it was known as Grape Wine Point, then as
                  Delaware-town and finally as New Castle. But twenty years after the Swedes had
                  settled here, the Dutchmen at New York coveted the place and the command of the
                  river; and as an earnest of what they intended to do, they came right here under
                  the very noses of the villagers and built Fort Kasimir.</p>
               <p>I can imagine how the old Swedes in the village stood over there on the Battery
                  and glowered at the Dutchmen as they labored upon the fort; and it is not
                  difficult to conceive the terror and dismay that filled those humble little homes
                  in New Stockholm when the intruder placed his queer brass cannon in the embrasures
                  of the fort after its completion, and when he would hurl a ball across the bows of
                  a Swedish ship coming up to the town, or would send a shot whistling over the
                  roofs of the village itself merely to gratify a grim humor. I would give a great
                  deal, Mrs. Adeler, to have but one day of that distant past recalled; to see New
                  Stockholm and its people as they were; to watch the Dutch chieftain and his
                  handful of men parading about in the fort in the panoply of war, and boasting of
                  the prowess that dared thus to defy the enemy upon his own threshold. But, alas!
                  look! not one vestige of the ancient battlements remains. The grass has grown over
                  the spot whereon they stood, and the rolling river has long since buried beneath
                  the sand of its shores whatever timbers of the structure touched its waters.<figure>

                  <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6059-00000130"/> It would have been forgotten, perhaps,
                  but that Irving, with the humorous pen which traced the history of the
                  Knicker-bockers, has given it immortality in the lines that tell how the
                  exasperated Swedes seized the fort and held the Dutchmen prisoners, and how, when
                  the news came to Manhattan island, the Dutch sent forth a valiant army, which not
                  only retook the fortress, but carried away nearly all the villagers.</p>
               <p>There was wild lamentation in the little community upon that day as the unhappy
                  people were torn from their homes and sent into exile; and though the historian
                  tells his tale sportively, the story always seemed to me to be full of pathos.</p>
               <p>This place was thronged with strange figures, and it witnessed some very sad
                  scenes in that far-off time. And if the traditions of the neighborhood may be
                  believed, those tough old warriors even yet have not bid farewell for ever to the
                  spot. There is no more fighting here, unless when some of the village urchins come
                  out to have a tussle upon the sward, and the chimneys of the town are unmolested
                  by hostile shot. But they do say that sometimes we may look upon the shadowy
                  outline of the ancient Hollanders who made this their battleground. The
                  venturesome wight who comes to old Fort Lane at certain seasons after nightfall

                  past him on the wind. There are those who have listened to the noise of cannon
                  balls rolling in the dusk over floors which no mortal eye can ever see, and often,

                  be heard above the roar of the storm, and from spectral ships floating upon the

                  still sorrowing for their lost homes.</p>

               <p>I do not say that this is so, Mrs. Adeler; I merely assert the existence of a
                  popular theory to that effect. I have private doubts if the goblin Dutchmen ever
                  have been seen, and I know of no reason why, if a ghost of that kind really comes
                  back to earth, he should return without his head.</p>
               <p>Judge Pitman has a field that is bounded upon one side by the lane, and in this
                  enclosure we found, upon our visit to the historic spot, a meditative cow with a
                  blind-board upon her forehead. There was nothing especially remarkable about the
                  board, and yet it has caused a great deal of trouble. In a recent interview with
                  me the judge sought to console himself for the misery created by that blind-board
                  by relating the story of his sorrow.</p>

                  ago, not because I was much afeared of gittin' drunk often, but just to please the
                  old woman. You know how women are—kinder insane on the subject of drinkin'. Well,
                  my cow had a way o'jumpin' the fence, an' I couldn't do nothin' to stop her. She
                  was the ornariest critter that way that I ever see. So at last I got a blind-board
                  an' hung it on her horns. That stopped her. But you know she used to come jam up
                  agin' the fence an' stand there for hours; an' one day one o' them vagabone
                  advertisin' agents come along—one o' them fellers that daubs signs all over the

                  in complete disgrace with all the people who attend our church. Some of the
                  admirers of Rev. Dr. Hopkins, the clergyman, gave <figure/> him a gold-headed cane
                  a few days ago, and a reporter of the <title>Argus</title> was invited to be
                  present. Nobody knows whether the reporter was temporarily insane, or whether the
                  foreman, in giving out the "copy," mixed it accidentally with an account of a
                  patent hog-killing machine which was tried in Wilmington on that same day, but the
                  appalling result was that the <title>Argus</title> next morning contained this
                  somewhat obscure but very dreadful narrative:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"Several of Rev. Dr. Hopkins's friends called upon him yesterday, and after a
                     brief conversation the unsuspicious hog was seized by the hind legs and slid
                     along a beam until he reached the hot-water tank. His friends explained the
                     object of their visit, and presented him with a very handsome gold-headed
                     butcher, who grabbed him by the tail, swung him around, slit his throat from
                     ear to ear, and in less than a minute the carcass was in the water. Thereupon
                     he came forward and said that there were times when the feelings overpowered
                     one, and for that reason he would not attempt to do more than thank those
                     around him, for the manner in which such a huge animal was cut into fragments
                     was simply astonishing. The doctor concluded his remarks, when the machine
                     seized him, and in less time than it takes to write it the hog was cut into
                     fragments and worked up into delicious sausage. The occasion will long be
                     remembered by the doctor's friends as one of the most delightful of their
                     lives. The best pieces can be procured for fifteen cents a pound; and we are
                     sure that those who have sat so long under his ministry will rejoice that he

                  mine, the son of old Commodore <figure/> Watson. Once, when the commodore was
                  about to go upon a voyage, he had a presentiment that something would occur to
                  him, and he made a will leaving his son Archibald all his property on condition
                  that, in case of his death, Archibald would visit his tomb and pray at it once
                  every year. Archibald made a solemn vow that he would, and the commodore started
                  upon his journey. Well, sir, the fleet went to the Fiji Islands, and while there
                  the old man came ashore one day, and was captured by the natives. They stripped
                  him, laid him upon a gridiron, cooked him and ate him."</p>
               <p>"That placed Archibald in a somewhat peculiar position?"</p>
               <p>"Imagine his feelings when he heard the news! How could he perform his vow? How
                  could he pray at the commodore's tomb? Would not the tomb, as it were, be very apt
                  to prey upon him, to snatch him up and assimilate him? There seemed to be an
                  imminent probability that it would But he went. That noble-hearted young man went
                  out to the islands in search of the savage that ate the commodore, and I have no
                  doubt that he suffered upon the same gridiron."<ref rend="super"

                  he may be successful, but I don't think he will be, I'm sorry to say."</p>

               <p>It was evident that Smiley had not heard the news, and I did not enlighten
                  him.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>"Some men have a fitness for that kind of work, and some haven't. There was poor
                  Bergner, a friend of mine. He took a class in a Sunday-school at Carlisle while we
                  were stationed there. The first Sunday he told the scholars a story about a boy
                  named Simms. Simms, he said, had climbed a tree for the purpose of stealing
                  apples, and he fell and killed himself. 'This,' said Bergner, 'conveys an
                  impressive warning to the young. It teaches an instructive lesson which I hope
                  will be heeded by all you boys. Bear in mind that if Simms had not gone into that
                  tree he would probably now be alive and well, and he might have grown up to be a
                  useful member of society. Remember this, boys,' said Bergner, 'and resolve firmly
                  now that when you wish to steal apples you will do so in the only safe way, which
                  is to stand on the ground and knock them down with a pole.' A healthy moral
                  lesson, wasn't it? Somebody told the superintendent perintendent about it, and
                  they asked Bergner to resign. Yes, a man has to have a peculiar turn for that kind
                  of thing to succeed in teaching Sunday-school. I don't know how Parker will make
                  out."</p>
               <p>Then the lieutenant shook hands and left in order to catch the last boat for the
                  fort.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Adeler," I said, as I lighted a fresh cigar, "we may regard it as a
                  particularly fortunate thing that Smiley is not entrusted with the religious
                  education of any number of American youth. Place the Sunday-schools of this land
                  in the hands of Smiley and others like him, and in the next generation the country
                  would be overrun with a race of liars."</p>
               <p>I am not aware that Bob Parker has ever made any very serious attempt to write
                  poetry for the public. Of course since he has been in love with the bewildering
                  Magruder he has sometimes expressed his feelings in verse. But fortunately these
                  breathings of passion were not presented to a cold and heartless world; they were
                  reserved for the sympathetic Magruder, who doubtless read them with delight and
                  admiration, and locked them up in her writing-desk with Bob's letters and other
                  precious souvenirs. This, of course, is all right. Every lover writes what he
                  considers poetry, and society permits such manifestations without insisting upon
                  the confinement of the offenders in lunatic asylums. Bob, however, has constructed
                  some verses which are not of a sentimental kind. Judge Pitman's story of the
                  illumination of Cooley's nose suggested the idea which Bob has worked into rhyme
                  and published in the <title>Argus.</title> As the poet has not been permitted to
                  shine to any great extent in these pages as a literary person, it will perhaps be
                  fair to reproduce his poem in the chapter which contains the account of Cooley's
                  misfortune. Here it is:</p>

               </p>
               <p>IT is difficult to imagine anything more dismal than a rainy day at New Castle,
                  particularly at this late period in the year. The river especially is robbed of
                  much of its attractiveness. The falling drops obscure the view, so that the other
                  shore is not visible through the gray curtain of mist, and the few vessels that
                  can be seen out in the channel struggling upward with the tide or beating slowly
                  downward to the bay look so drenched and cold and utterly forlorn that one shivers
                  as he watches them, with their black sails and their dripping cordage, and sees
                  the moist sailors in tarpaulins and sea-boots hurrying over the slippery decks.
                  The grain schooner lying at the wharf has all her hatches down, and there is about
                  her no other sign of life than one soaked vagabond, who sits upon the bowsprit
                  angling in a most melancholy fashion for fish which will not bite. He may be
                  seeking for his supper, poor, damp sinner! or he may be an infatuated being who
                  deceives himself with the notion that he is having sport. There is a peculiar
                  feeling of comfort on such a day to stand in a room where a bright fire blazes in
                  the grate, and from the window to watch this solitary fisherman as the fitful
                  gusts now and then blow the rain down upon his head in sheets, and to observe the
                  few people who remain upon the streets hurrying by under their umbrellas, each
                  anxious to reach a place of shelter. The water pours in yellow torrents through
                  the gutter-ways, the carriages which go swiftly past have their leathern aprons
                  drawn high up in front of the drivers, the stripped branches of the trees are
                  black with moisture, and from each twig the drops trickle to the earth; the
                  water-spout upon the side of the house continues its monotonous song all day long,
                  drip, drip, drip, until the very sound contributes to the gloominess of the time;
                  there is desolation in the yard and in the garden, where a few yellow corn-stalks
                  and headless trunks of cabbage remain from the summer's harvest to face the wintry
                  storms, and where the chickens gathered under the woodshed are standing with
                  ruffled feathers, hungry, damp and miserable, some on one leg and some on two, and
                  with an expression upon their faces that tells plainly the story of their
                  dejection at the poor prospect of having any dinner.</p>

               <p>It is a good time, Mrs. Adeler, to offer a few remarks upon that subject of
                  perennial interest, the weather, and especially to refer to some facts in
                  reference to that useful but uncertain implement, the umbrella. I do not know why
                  it is so, but by common agreement the umbrella has been permitted to assume a
                  comic aspect. No man, particularly no journalist, can be considered as having
                  wholly discharged his duty to his fellow-creatures unless he has permitted himself
                  to make some jocular remarks concerning the exception of umbrellas from the laws
                  which govern other kinds of property. The amount of facetiousness that has
                  attended the presentation of that theory is already incalculably great, and there
                  is no reason for believing that it will not be increased to an infinite extent
                  throughout the coming ages. It is perhaps a feeble idea upon which to erect so
                  vast a structure; but if it makes even a dismal sort of merriment, we should not
                  complain. And then reflect with what humorous effect the comic artists introduce
                  the excessive and corpulent umbrella to their pictures of nervous or emphatic old
                  ladies, and how much more convulsive the laughter becomes at the theatre when the
                  low-comedy man carries with him an umbrella of that unwieldy description! It is
                  universally admitted that an umbrella with distended sides is funny; and if
                  general consent is given to such a proposition, the consequences are quite as
                  satisfactory as if the article in question was really plethoric with humor.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>There are occasions when the simple elevation of an umbrella is grotesquely
                  absurd, as when a group of British guardsmen sheltered themselves in this fashion
                  from the rain during a certain battle, to the infinite disgust of Wellington, who
                  ordered the tender warriors to put their umbrellas down lest the service should be
                  made ridiculous. It was a Frenchman, Émile Girardin, I think, who brought an
                  umbrella with him to the dueling-ground, and insisted upon holding it over his
                  head during the combat. "I do not mind being killed," he said, "but I object
                  decidedly to getting wet." They gave him much credit for admirable coolness; but I
                  cherish a private opinion that he was scared, and hoped, by making the affair
                  ridiculous, to bring it to a conclusion without burning powder; and he succeeded,
                  for the combatants shook hands and went away friends.</p>

               <p>And there was the case of Colonel Coombs—Coombs of Colorado. He had heard that the
                  most ferocious wild beast could be frightened and put to flight if an umbrella
                  should suddenly be opened in its face, and he determined to test the matter at the
                  earliest opportunity. One day, while walking in the woods, Coombs perceived a
                  panther crouching, preparatory to making a spring at him. Coombs held his umbrella
                  firmly in his hand, and presenting it at the panther, unfurled it. The result was
                  not wholly satisfactory, for the next moment the animal leaped upon the umbrella,
                  flattened it out and began to lunch upon Coombs. Not only did the beast eat that
                  anxious inquirer after truth, but it swallowed <figure/>
                  <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6059-00000142"/> the hooked handle of the umbrella,
                  which was held tightly in Coombs's grasp, and for two or three weeks it wandered
                  about with its nose buried among the ribs of the umbrella. It was very handy when
                  there was rain, but it obstructed the animal's vision, and consequently it walked
                  into town and was killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>In some countries the umbrella is the symbol of dignity and power. One of the
                  magnates of Siam is proud to begin his list of titles with "Lord of Thirty-seven
                  Umbrellas." Conceive, if you can, the envy and hatred with which that bloated
                  aristocrat must be regarded by a man who is lord of only fifteen umbrellas! Among
                  certain African tribes the grandeur of the individual increases with the size, and
                  not with the number, of the umbrellas. Did I ever tell you the story of the
                  African chieftain who determined to surpass all his rivals in this respect?</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>He made up his mind to procure the largest umbrella in the world, and he induced a
                  trader to send his order to London for the article. Its ribs were forty feet in
                  length, and its handle was like a telegraph pole. When it was distended, the
                  effect was sublime. The machine resembled a green gingham circus tent, and it was
                  crowned with a ferule as large as a barrel. When the umbrella arrived, there was
                  great rejoicing in the domestic circle of that dusky sovereign, and so impatient
                  was the owner to test its qualities that he fairly yearned for the arrival of a
                  rainy day. At last, one morning ing, he awoke to find that his opportunity had
                  come. The rain was pouring in torrents. Exultingly he called forth his vassals,
                  and the work of opening the umbrella began in the presence of an awestricken
                  multitude. Two entire days were consumed by the effort to elevate the monster, and
                  at the end of the second day, as the task was done, the storm ceased, and there
                  was a general clearing up. The disappointed chieftain waited a day or two in vain
                  for another shower, and finally, sick at heart, he commanded the umbrella to be
                  closed. The work occupied precisely forty-eight hours, and just as the catch
                  snapped upon the handle a thunder-gust came up, and it rained furiously all day.
                  The frenzied monarch then consulted with his medicine man, and was assured that
                  there would certainly be rain on the following Wednesday. The king therefore
                  ordered the gingham giant up again. While the swarthy myrmidons were struggling
                  with it there were at least sixty or seventy violent showers, but just as it was
                  fairly open the clouds drifted away, and the sun came out with terrific force. And
                  it remained out. There was not a drop of rain or so much as a fragment of cloud in
                  the sky for two hundred and seventy-three days, and the umbrella remained open
                  during all the time, while the potentate who owned it went dancing about daily <figure/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6059-00000143"/> in an ecstasy of rage. At the end of
                  the period he sought the medicine man and slew him upon the spot. Then he ordered
                  the umbrella down. The very next morning after it was closed the rain began, and
                  it has been raining ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adeler, that unfortunate savage thus became intimately familiar with one of
                  the most striking of meteorological phenomena.</p>
               <p>The influence of the umbrella upon the weather is a subject that has engaged the
                  attention of millions of mankind. The precise laws by which that influence is
                  exerted and governed have not yet been defined, but the fact of the existence of
                  the influence is universally recognized. If there seems to be a promise of rain in
                  the morning when I leave home, and I carry my umbrella with me, the sky clears
                  before noon; but if I neglect to take my umbrella, I will certainly be drenched.
                  If I carry an umbrella forty days in order to be prepared in case of sudden
                  showers, there will be perfect dryness during that period; but if I forget the
                  umbrella on the forty-first day, the floodgates of heaven will assuredly be
                  opened. Sometimes the conduct of the elements is peculiarly aggravating. When I
                  have been caught in town by a rain-storm and I had no umbrella, I have sometimes
                  darted through the shower to a store to purchase one, but always, just as the man
                  has given me the change, the rain has stopped. And when I have kept one umbrella
                  at the house and another at the office, in order to be prepared at both ends of
                  the line, all the storms have begun and expended their fury while I was passing
                  between the two points.</p>
               <p>This experience is not peculiar. It is that of every man who uses an umbrella. I
                  am persuaded, Mrs. Adeler, that the time will come when science, having detected
                  the character of the mysterious sympathy existing between umbrellas and the
                  weather, will be able to give to a suffering world sunshine or rain as we want it.
                  Whether we shall then be any better off is another matter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, while we are waiting for science to penetrate the hidden secrets
                  of the umbrella, let me unfold to you a plan which I have devised for the better
                  management of the weather bureau at Washington. I confided the scheme, once upon a
                  time, to Old Probabilities himself, through the medium of a newspaper at the
                  capital, but he did not deign to express an opinion concerning it. Perhaps it
                  contained too much levity to entitle it to the consideration of a man who
                  meditates upon the thunder and tries to trace the pathway of the cyclone. I have
                  called it</p>

                           <p>The Probability man who meddles with our great American weather means
                              well, and tries conscientiously to do his best, but his system is
                              radically defective, and the consequence is that his conjectures are
                              despicably incorrect quite half the time. The inconvenience caused by
                              these mistakes, not only to the people generally, but to me
                              personally, is inconceivably great, and it is not to be endured any
                              longer.</p>
                           <p>For instance, if I read in the morning that this Probability person
                              entertains a conviction that we shall have a clear day in my
                              neighborhood, I place confidence in his assurance. I remove the roof
                              from my house in order to dry the garret thoroughly, and I walk down
                              town with a new umbrella under my arm. Now, it is plainly evident that
                              if, after all, it does begin to rain, and I am obliged to unfurl that
                              umbrella and ruin it with the wet, and I am compelled, when I arrive
                              at home, to witness my family floating around in the dining-room upon
                              a raft constructed out of the clothes-horse and a few bed-slats and
                              pie-boards, the government for which Washington died is a failure.</p>
                           <p>Or suppose that our friend at the weather office asserts<pb
                                 n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6059-00000144"/> that a thunder-storm is
                              certain to strike my section of the country upon a given day. I
                              believe him. I bring out my lightning-rods and buckle them to the
                              chimneys and set them around on the roof and plant them out in the
                              yard and rivet them upon my hired girl; and I place my family safely
                              in feather beds in the middle of the room, and drink all the milk in
                              the neighborhood, and prevail upon the tax collector to go and stand
                              an hour or two under a tree where he will be almost certain to be
                              struck by lightning. And when all these arrangements are completed, so
                              that I feel equal to the promised emergency, suppose that
                              thunder-storm does not come? When I watch that tax collector sally out
                              and begin to assess my property, counting in all those lightning-rods
                              at double their cost, is there any reason to wonder that I sit down
                              and sigh for some responsible despot who will give us a Probability
                              man who grasps the subject of the weather, as it were, in a more
                              comprehensive manner?</p>
                           <p>But I lost all faith in him after his ill-treatment of Cooley. He said
                              that a cyclone would sweep over this district upon a certain morning,
                              and Cooley was so much alarmed at the prospect that he made elaborate
                              preparations to receive the storm. He arose before daybreak and went
                              into the middle of his garden, where he filled his pockets with pig
                              lead, fettered himself to the apple tree and fixed the preserving
                              kettle securely upon his head with a dog chain in order to preserve
                              his hair. Cooley stayed there until five o'clock in the afternoon
                              waiting for the simoom to swoop down upon him. <figure/> But it was a
                              failure—a disgraceful failure. And when Cooley looked out from under
                              the kettle in the afternoon, he was surprised to observe that the
                              fence was filled with men and boys who were watching him with intense
                              interest. Then the boys began to whistle upon their fingers and to
                              make unpleasant remarks, and finally Cooley was obliged to cut loose
                              and go into the house to avoid arrest by a policeman upon a charge of
                              lunacy.</p>
                           <p>Now, this is all wrong. The feelings of American citizens ought not to
                              be trifled with in such a manner, and I propose to arrange a plan by
                              which meteorological facts and conditions can be observed with
                              something like certainty.</p>
                           <p>The basis of my system is Corns. The marvelous accuracy with which
                              changes in the weather can be foretold by a man whose feet are
                              decorated with those excrescences is so well known that it is hardly
                              worth while to consider at length, at this particular crisis, the
                              human corn in its meteorological characteristics. It is quite certain,
                              however, that it will be impossible to expect the Probability being to
                              walk around the country once or twice every day for the purpose of
                              submitting his corns to the diverse atmospheric influences which exist
                              between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It would wear out any man. It
                              will be better, therefore, to have him kept stationary. I propose, in
                              that event, that he should buy up any available corn that is in the
                              market in any given State, and have it transplanted and grafted upon
                              his own toe. Doubtless there are patriotic citizens in every portion
                              of the land who would be willing to lay upon the altar of their
                              beloved country their most cherished corns.</p>
                           <p>The Probability official then might obtain, let us assume, one corn
                              from each State and a reliable bunion to represent each Territory.
                              When these were engrafted upon his feet in a healthful condition, each
                              one would, as a matter of course,<pb n="288-289"
                                 xml:id="VAC6059-00000145"/> be peculiarly susceptible to the
                              atmospheric influences which prevail in its native clime. All we have
                              to do, then, is to compel the weather man to wear exceptionally tight
                              boots while he is not attending to business, so that his barometers
                              will acquire the requisite amount of sensibility. Then I should have
                              pipes laid from each State to the office in Washington for the purpose
                              of conveying the different varieties of atmosphere to the foot of the
                              Probability person. Suppose, then, he desired to make a guess in
                              regard to the weather in Louisiana. I should have a man stationed at
                              the end of the pipe in New Orleans with a steam fan, and he could waft
                              zephyrs, as it were, upon the Louisiana corn, which would respond
                              instantly, and we should have the facts about the weather in that
                              State with precision and accuracy. When we admitted a new State, our
                              friend could weld on a new corn; or if the Mormons succeeded in
                              procuring the admission of their Territory as a State, we could plough
                              up the Utah bunion and plant a corn, so as to preserve the
                              proprieties.</p>
                           <p>Of course this system of excrescences would be of no value as an
                              indicator of the movements of thunder-storms and hurricanes. But in
                              order to acquire information concerning the former, how would it do to
                              build up stacks of lightning-rods in every portion of every State, and
                              to connect each State group, if I may be allowed the expression, with
                              a wire which shall be permanently fastened to the arm or leg of the
                              Probability man in Washington? Because, in such a case, when-ever a
                              thunder-gust appeared in any portion of the country, some one out of
                              all those bunches of lightning-rods would certainly be struck, and our
                              conjectural friend at the weather office would be likely to know about
                              it right soon.</p>
                           <p>As for hurricanes, I am in favor of putting an end to them at once,
                              instead of telegraphing around the country to warn people to look out
                              for them. When I reorganize the weather service, I shall have men
                              stationed everywhere with machines fixed up like the wind sails that
                              are used on ship-board for sending air into the hold. I should make
                              the mouth of each one a mile wide, construct it of stout canvas, and
                              run the lower end into a coal-mine, or a mammoth cave, or a volcano.
                              Then, when a tornado approached, I should place a man at each side of
                              the sail, put the men into balloons, send them up, and spread the sail
                              directly across the route of the approaching cyclone. When it arrived,
                              it would strike the sail, of course; there would be a momentary
                              flapping and jerking around, and in a minute or two I should have that
                              hurricane comfortably packed away in the volcano, suppose we say. A
                              man would then be upon the spot, of course, to drive a plug into the
                              crater, so as to make everything tight and snug, and one more nuisance
                              is taken off the face of the earth.</p>

               <p>"Is that the whole of the article?" inquired Mrs. Adeler.</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is all of it."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am not surprised that no notice was taken of it. It is perfectly
                  nonsensical."</p>
               <p>"I admit the fact, but still I shall not smother the article. It will not do to
                  take all the nonsense out of the world. While thousands of learned fools are hard
                  at work trying to stupefy mankind, we must be permitted sometimes to indulge in
                  absurdities of a less weighty kind in order to counteract them."</p>
               <p>And while we are discussing the weather, let me not forget to allude to the most
                  remarkable of Judge Pitman's peculiarities. He is the only man in the world of
                  whom I know anything who is always satisfied with the weather. No matter what the
                  condition of the atmosphere, he is contented and happy, and willing to affirm that
                  the state of things at<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6059-00000146"/> any given moment
                  is the very best that could have been devised.</p>
               <p>In summer, when the mercury bolted up among the nineties, the judge would come to
                  the front door with beads of perspiration standing out all over his red face, and
                  would look at the sky and say, "Splendid! perfectly splendid! Noble weather for
                  the poor and for the ice companies and the washerwomen! I never saw sich
                  magnificent weather for dryin' clothes. They don't shake up any such climate as
                  this in Italy. Gimme me my umbreller, Harriet, while I sit out yer on the steps
                  and enjoy it."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>In winter, when the mercury would creep down fifteen degrees below zero, and the
                  cold was nearly severe enough to freeze the inside of Vesuvius solid to the centre
                  of the globe, Pitman would sit out on my fence and exclaim, "By gracious, Adeler!
                  did you ever see sich weather as this? I like an atmosphere that freezes up yer
                  very marrer. It helps the coal trade an' gives us good skeetin'. Don't talk of
                  summer-time to me. Gimme cold, and give it to me stiff."</p>
               <p>When there was a drought, Pitman used to meet me in the street and remark, "No
                  rain yet, I see! Magnificent, isn't it? I want my weather dry, I want it with the
                  dampness left out. Moisture breeds fevers and ague, an' ruins yer boots. If
                  there's anything I despise, it's to carry an umbreller. No rain for me, if you
                  please."</p>
               <p>When it rained for a week and flooded the country, the judge often dropped in to
                  see me and to observe, "I dunno how you feel about this yer rain, Adeler, but it
                  allers seems to me that the heavens never drop no blessin's but when we have a
                  long wet spell. It makes the corn jump an' cleans the sewers an' keeps the springs
                  from gittin' too dry. I wouldn't give a cent to live in a climate where there was
                  no rain. Put me on the Nile, an' I'd die in a week. Soak me through an' through to
                  the inside of my bones, and I feel as if life was bright and beautiful, an' sorrer
                  of no account."</p>
               <p>On a showery day, when the sun shone brightly at one moment and at the next the
                  rain poured in torrents, the judge has been known to stand at the window and
                  exclaim, "Harriet, if you'd 've asked me how I liked the weather, I'd 've said,
                  just as it is now. What I want is weather that is streaked like a piece of fat an'
                  lean bacon—a little shine an' a little rain. Mix 'em up an' give us plenty of
                  both, an' I'm yer man."</p>
               <p>The judge is always happy in a thunder-storm, and one day, after the lightning had
                  knocked down two of his best apple trees and splintered them into fragments, and
                  the wind had torn his chimney to pieces, I went over to see him. He was standing
                  by the prostrate trees, and he at once remarked, "Did you ever know of a man
                  havin' sich luck as this? I was goin' to chop down them two trees tomorrer, an' as
                  that chimney never draw'd well, I had concluded to have it rebuilt. An' that
                  gorgeous old storm has fixed things just the way I want 'em. Put me in a
                  thunder-storm an' let the lightnin' play around me, an' I'm at home. I'd rather
                  have one storm that 'd tear the bowels out of the American continent than a dozen
                  of yer little dribblin' <figure/>
                  <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6059-00000147"/> waterin'-pot showers. If I can't have
                  a rippin' and roarin' storm, I don't want none."</p>
               <p>They say here in the village, but I do not believe it, that one day the judge was
                  upon his roof fixing a shingle, when a tornado struck him, lifted him off, carried
                  him a quarter of a mile, and dashed him with such terrible force against a fence
                  that his leg was broken. As they carried him home, he opened his eyes languidly
                  and said, "Immortal Moses! what a storm that was! When it does blow, it suits me
                  if it blows hard. I'd give both legs if we could have a squall like that every
                  day. I—I—" Then he fainted.</p>
               <p>If contentment is happiness, then the life of Pitman is one uninterrupted
                  condition of bliss.</p>

               </p>
               <p>WE had been talking of asking the Magruders to come to take tea with us, so that
                  the two families, which were now to be brought into close relations, might become
                  better acquainted. But one evening, just as I had settled myself for a comfortable
                  perusal of the paper, Miss Magruder was ushered into the room by the servant. It
                  was plainly evident from her appearance that she was in distress from some cause.
                  We should have guessed from her visit at such an hour unaccompanied by any one
                  that all was not right, even if her countenance had not manifested extreme
                  agitation. After the usual salutation she asked,</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Parker not at home?"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"He has not yet returned from the city," I said. "I suppose he has been detained
                  for some reason. It is probable that he will be here presently."</p>
               <p>"I wanted to see him," she said, hesitatingly. "I am afraid you'll think it very
                  queer for me to come here at such<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6059-00000148"/> a
                  strange time; but—but"—and here her voice quavered a little—"but oh, something
                  dreadful has happened—something very, very dreadful."</p>
               <p>Then the tears began to come into her pretty brown eyes, and the little maid,
                  after striving desperately to restrain them and to retain her composure, buried
                  her face in her hands and began to sob. There was a woman by her side in a moment
                  to comfort her and to seek her confidence; but it was very awkward for me. I was
                  not quite certain whether I ought not to fly from the room and permit the two to
                  be alone. But I remained with mingled feelings of sympathy and curiosity, and with
                  an indistinct notion that the forlorn damsel before me regarded me as a
                  flinty-hearted brute because I didn't express violent indignation at her
                  ill-treatment. I should have done so if I had had any conception of the nature of
                  the wrong endured by her. At last, when she had obtained relief in a good cry—and
                  it is surprising how much better a troubled woman feels when she has cried and
                  wiped her weeping eyes—Bessie told us the story.</p>
               <p>"Father came to me to-day," she said, "and told me that he had heard some dreadful
                  things about Robert; and he said he could not consent to my marriage with such a
                  man, and that our engagement must be broken off."</p>
               <p>"What kind of things?" indignantly demanded Mrs. Adeler, whose family pride was
                  aroused; "what did he hear?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, something perfectly awful!" exclaimed Bessie, looking up with fresh tears in
                  her eyes. "He said Robert drank a great deal and that he was very often
                  intoxicated."</p>
               <p>"What an outrageous falsehood!" exclaimed Mrs. Adeler.</p>
               <p>"I told father it was," said Bessie; "but he said he knew it was true, and, worse
                  than that, that Robert not only kept very bad company in the city, but that he was
                  an atheist—that he only came to church in order to deceive us."</p>
               <p>If the late Mr. Fahrenheit had had to indicate the warmth of Mrs. Adeler's
                  indignation at this moment, he would have given 215° as the figure. "I declare,"
                  she said, "that is the wickedest falsehood I ever heard. I will call upon Mrs.
                  Magruder to-morrow morning and tell her so."</p>
               <p>"And father insisted," said Bessie, "that I should write a formal note to Robert,
                  breaking our engagement and asking him to discontinue his visits to our house. I
                  did so, but I could not bear to have him think me so heartless, and I felt as if I
                  must come here and tell him about it before the note reached him. Please don't
                  think it strange that I came, and don't let any one know it." Then Bessie began to
                  sob again.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Bessie," I replied, "it was very proper for you to do as you have
                  done. Your father has been unjust to you and to Bob. Robert shall see him and
                  demand an explanation. But who do you suppose told your father these things?"</p>
               <p>"I have no idea. But it must have been somebody who was opposed to our marriage,
                  and who hated Robert. I can't believe that any one would have invented such
                  stories without a very malicious motive."</p>
               <p>"Well, Bessie, the only thing we can do now is to permit the matter to rest as it
                  is until we have an opportunity to disprove these slanders. Let me go home with
                  you; and when Bob comes in, I will tell him all about it. He shall call upon your
                  father. I will do so myself to-morrow. Bob has been unfairly used. He is as proper
                  a youth as any in the land, and worthy of the love of any woman."</p>
               <p>Then I escorted Bessie to her home, and upon my way back I met Bob coming in hot
                  haste toward me. He arrived at the house just after our departure; and a few words
                  from Mrs. Adeler having placed him in command of the situation, he started off at
                  once with the hope to overtake us and to<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6059-00000149"
                  /> have a few words with Bessie. He was breathless and in a condition of frenzy.
                  He at first insisted upon storming the castle of the Magruders at once for the
                  purpose of assailing the dragon that guarded his fair lady. But I showed him that
                  it would perhaps injure Bessie if he should excite suspicion that she had visited
                  him, and that it would be ridiculous at any rate to attack old Magruder at that
                  time of night and while he was in such a state of excitement. It was finally
                  agreed that we should wait until morning, and that then I should first visit Mr.
                  Magruder and obtain an explanation from him, so that Bob could go there afterward
                  fully prepared to vindicate himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"I'll bet anything," said Bob, as we walked home, "I know who is the author of
                  these slanders. It is Cooley. He don't like you or any of your family, and he has
                  taken this means of injuring us. If it is he, I'll give him an aggravated case of
                  assault and battery to settle. I'll thrash him within an inch of his life."</p>
               <p>"I don't believe Cooley did it," I replied. "It is not the kind of business that
                  he would care to trouble himself with. It is some one who has an interest in
                  separating you and Bessie."</p>
               <p>"I don't know of any such person," said Bob.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps Smiley did it."</p>
               <p>"That may be," replied Bob; "he has little enough principle, but I hardly think he
                  would display so much malice. Besides, he knows very well Bessie would not accept
                  him under any circumstances."</p>
               <p>"Well, let us wait patiently for further developments. It is not worth while to
                  denounce any one until we can ascertain who the offender is."</p>
               <p>Bob had been delayed in the city by a visit to his parents, who were going north
                  for a week or two, and they consigned to his care his younger brother, who came
                  with him to our house to remain during the absence of his father and mother. The
                  boy was at the house when we reached it; and when the time came for him to go to
                  bed, it was arranged that he should sleep with Bob. The consequences of this were
                  somewhat peculiar. The youngster, it appears, has a habit of walking in his sleep,
                  and he was so afraid that he would do so on this night, in a strange house, that
                  Bob tied a strong piece of twine about the lad's waist and fastened the other end
                  to his own body, so that he would be roused by any attempt on the part of his
                  brother to prowl about the room. It turned out, however, that Bob was the restless
                  one. According to his own account, he got to dreaming of his troubles. He imagined
                  that he was engaged in a frightful combat with Mr. Magruder, and that, at the
                  last, that amiable old gentleman pursued him with a drawn dagger with the intent
                  to butcher him. In his alarm Bob pushed over to Henry's side of the bed, and
                  finally, as the visionary Magruder still appeared to be thirsty for his blood, he
                  climbed over Henry, got upon the floor and hid himself beneath the bed. When the
                  apparition of the <figure/>
                  <figure/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6059-00000150"/> sanguinary parent disappeared, Bob,
                  still soundly asleep, must have emerged from his hiding-place upon the side of the
                  bed opposite that at which he entered it. At any rate, the cord ran from Henry's
                  body beneath the bed clear around until it connected with Bob. Early in the
                  morning Bob moved over suddenly toward his brother; and although he was more than
                  half asleep, he was amazed to see Henry drop over upon the floor. Bob instantly
                  jumped out after him, and as he did so, he was even more surprised to perceive the
                  child dart under the bed. He followed Henry; and at the first movement in that
                  direction, Henry shot up off the floor, and was heard rolling swiftly across the
                  mattress above, only to disappear again over the side as Bob came once more to the
                  surface. By this time both of them were wide awake and able to comprehend<figure/>
                  <figure/>
                  <figure/> prehend the phenomenon. This is Mr. Parker's version. It is probably
                  exaggerated slightly. My private impression is that Henry was pulled out upon the
                  floor and under the bed, and that the exercise ended immediately. Henry does not
                  remember the particulars with sufficient distinctness to be considered a
                  thoroughly reliable witness. His mind is clear upon only one point: he is fully
                  persuaded that he will not sleep in harness with Bob again.</p>

               <p>Upon the day following Bessie's visit I called at Magruder's, in accordance with
                  my agreement with Bob. The servant said Mr. Magruder had gone out, but that he
                  would probably be home in a few moments. I declined an invitation to go in the
                  house. It was a fine day, and I preferred to walk up and down the porch while
                  waiting. When a considerable time had elapsed and Magruder did not come, I threw
                  myself upon one of the chairs on the porch and began to read the
                     <title>Argus.</title>
               </p>
               <p>While I was sitting there Magruder's dog came bounding up the yard, and when he
                  saw me instantly manifested a desire to investigate me. I have never liked
                  Magruder's dog; he is very large, and he has an extremely bad reputation. When he
                  approached me, he looked at me savagely, and growled in such a manner that cold
                  chills began to run up and down my back. Then the dog walked up and sniffed my
                  legs with an earnestness of purpose that I had never expected to see displayed by
                  a dumb animal. During this operation I maintained a condition of profound repose.
                     No<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6059-00000151"/> man will ever know how quiet I
                  was. It is doubtful if any human being ever before became so thoroughly still
                  until his immortal soul went to the land of everlasting rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>When the ceremony was ended, the dog lay down close to the chair. As soon as I
                  felt certain that the animal was asleep, I thought I would go home without seeing
                  Mr. Magruder; but when I attempted to rise, the dog leaped up and growled so
                  fiercely that I sat down again at once. Then I thought perhaps it would be better
                     <emph>not</emph> to go home. It occurred to me, however, that it would be as
                  well to call some one to remove the dog, in case circumstances should make it
                  desirable for me to depart. But at the very first shout the animal jumped to his
                  feet, gave a fiendish bark and began to take a few more inquisitorial smells at my
                  legs. And whenever I shuffled my feet, or attempted to turn the
                     <title>Argus</title> over in order to continue an article on to the following
                  page, or made the slightest movement, that infamous dog was up and at me. Once,
                  when I was positively compelled to sneeze, I thought, from the indignation
                  boisterously manifested by the dog, that my hour at last had come.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, Cooley's dog, which happened to be in the neighborhood, became engaged in
                  an angry controversy with another dog in the street in front of me. Magruder's dog
                  was wide awake in a moment; and after turning a regretful glance at me, as if he
                  knew he was deliberately and foolishly throwing away a chance of obtaining several
                  glorious bites, he dashed down the walk and over the fence for the purpose of
                  participating in the discussion between his two friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>

               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I did not actually run, because that would not have been dignified, and the
                  servant-girl, looking from the kitchen window, and not understanding the nature of
                  the emergency, might have suspected me of emotional insanity. But I walked
                  rapidly—very rapidly—to the rear fence of the yard, and climbed over it. As I
                  reached the top of the fence, I saw the dog coming at full gallop down the yard.
                  He was probably chagrined, but I did not remain to see how he bore it. I went
                  directly home. Mr. Parker may manage his own love affairs in the future. I shall
                  not approach Mr. Magruder upon this disagreeable<figure/>
                  <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6059-00000152"/> able subject again. I have enough to
                  do to attend to my own business.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>When I reached home, I found Judge Pitman waiting for me. He came in for the
                  purpose of borrowing my axe for a few moments. As we went around to the rear of
                  the house to get it, the judge said:</p>
               <p>"I reckon you don't use no terbacker, do you?"</p>
               <p>"I smoke sometimes; that is all."</p>
               <p>"Well, I was jist feelin' 's if I wanted a chaw, an' I thought p'rhaps you might
                  have one about you. Seein' Cooley over there on his porch put me in mind of
                  it."</p>
               <p>"That is rather a singular circumstance. Why should a view of Cooley suggest such
                  a thing?"</p>
               <p>"'Tis kinder sing'lar; but you see," said the judge, "Cooley was a-tellin' me
                  yesterday mornin' about somethin' that occurred the day before at his house. The
                  old woman is opposed to his chawin', an' she makes it stormy for him when he does.
                  So he never uses no terbacker 'round home, an' he told her he'd given it up. The
                  other day, just as he was goin' in to supper, he pulled out his handkercher, an'
                  out come a plug of terbacker 'long with it. He didn't know it, but directly Mrs.
                  Cooley lit on it, an' she walked up to him an' wanted to know if it was his. It
                  was a little rough, you understand, but he had presence of mind enough to turn to
                  his boy and say, 'Great <figure/> Heavens! is it possible you've begun to chaw
                  this ornary stuff? What d'you mean by sich conduct? Haven't I told you often
                  enough to let terbacker alone? Commere to me this minute, you rascal!' Cooley
                  licked him like the nation, an' then threw the terbacker out the winder onto the
                  porch, where he could git it agin in the mornin'."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"That was pretty severe treatment of the boy."</p>
               <p>"An' Cooley says to me, 'By gracious, judge! s'pose'n my children had all been
                  girls! It makes an old father's heart glad when he thinks he has a boy he can
                  depend upon at sich times!' Healthy old parent, ain't he?"</p>
               <p>"The word 'healthy' hardly expresses with sufficient vigor the infamy of his
                  conduct."</p>
               <p>"Cooley never did treat that there boy right," said the judge, as he seated
                  himself on the saw-horse in the woodshed and locked his hands over one of his
                  knees, evidently with the intention to have some sociable conversation. "He never
                  behaved like a father to him. He brought up that there child to lie. That echo
                  business, f'r instance; it was scand'lus in him."</p>
               <p>"To what do you refer?"</p>
               <p>"Why, afore Cooley come yer to live he kep' a hotel up in the Lehigh Valley—a
                  fashionable kinder tavern, I reckon; an' there was another man about two miles
                  furder up who had a bigger hotel. You could stand on this other man's porch an'
                  make a splendid echo by whistlin' or hollerin'. You could hear the noise agin a
                  dozen times. Leastways, Cooley told me so. Well, Cooley, you know, hated like
                  pisin to be beaten on that echo, an' so he kinder concluded to git one up for
                  himself. He made that there boy of his'n go over on the mountain across the river
                  an' hide among the<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6059-00000153"/> bushes, an' then he
                  would take people up on the roof of the house and holler, an' the boy would holler
                  back agin. He told everybody that the echo could only be heard on the roof, an' he
                  kep' the trap door locked, so's nobody would find him out."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"That was a poor kind of a swindle."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. Well, that boy, you 'bserve, gradually got rusty in the business an'
                  tired of it, an' sometimes he'd take another boy over with him, an' they'd git to
                  playin' an' forgit to answer. It was embarrassin' for Cooley, an' the secret begun
                  to leak out. But one day the whole concern was bu'sted. Cooley took a lot of folks
                  from the city, among 'em some o' them newspaper people, an' for a while the boy
                  worked all right. But he had another feller with him, and he kep' a-repeatin'
                  things that nobody said. Cooley stood it for a while, though he was mad as fury;
                  an' at last, when somebody tried to start the echo, there was no answer. They all
                  thought it was mighty queer, but after callin' a good many times, the boy come out
                  in full view an' yelled back, 'I'm not a-goin' to answer any more. Bill Johnson
                  won't gimme my knife, an' I won't holler till I git it; blamed if I do.' Cooley
                  tells me that the manner in which he sailed across the <figure/> creek after that
                  child was somethin' awful to behold. But it knocked him, sir. It closed him up.
                  Them newspaper men started the thing on him, an' they run him so hard that he had
                  to quit. He sold out and come yer to live. But is it any wonder that boy's spiled?
                  Cooley'd spile a blessed young angel the way he goes on. But I must say
                  good-mornin'. Much obleeged for the axe. Good-bye."</p>
               <p>And the judge went home meditating upon Cooley's unfitness for the duties of a
                  parent. I would like to know if that echo story is true. I have no doubt the judge
                  received it from Cooley, but it sounds as if the latter ingenious gentleman might
                  have wrenched it from his imagination.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I HAVE been the victim of a somewhat singular persecution for several weeks past.
                  When we came here to live, Judge Pitman was partially bald. Somebody induced him
                  to apply to his head a hair restorative made by a Chicago man named Pulsifer.
                  After using this liquid for a few months, the judge was gratified to find that his
                  hair had returned; and as he naturally regarded the remedy with admiration, he
                  concluded that it would be simply fair to give expression to his feelings in some
                  form. As I happened to be familiar with all the facts of the case, the judge
                  induced me to draw up a certificate affirming them over my signature. This he
                  mailed to Pulsifer. I have not yet ceased to regret the weakness which permitted
                  me to stand sponsor for Judge Pitman's hair. Of course, Pulsifer immediately
                  inserted the certificate, with my name and residence attached to it, in half the
                  papers in the country, as a displayed advertisement, <figure/> beginning with the
                  words, "HOPE FOR THE BALDHEADED; THE MOST REMARKABLE CURE ON RECORD," in the
                  largest capital letters.</p>
               <p>I have had faith in advertising since that time. And Pulsifer had confidence in it
                  too, for he wrote to me to know what I would take to get him up a series of
                  similar certificates of cures performed by his other patent medicines. He had a
                  corn-salve which dragged a little in its sales, and he was prepared to offer me a
                  commission if I would write him a strong letter to the effect that six or eight
                  frightful corns had been eradicated from my feet with his admirable preparation.
                  He was in a position, also, to do something handsome if I could describe a few
                  miraculous cures that had been effected by his Rheumatic Lotion, or if I would
                  name certain ruined stomachs which had, as it were, been born again through the
                  influence of Pulsifer's Herb Bitters; and from the manner in which he wrote, I
                  think he would have taken me into partnership if I had consented to write an
                  assurance that his Ready Relief had healed a bad leg of eighteen years' standing,
                  and that I could never feel that my duty was honorably performed until he sent me
                  a dozen bottles more for distribution among my friends whose legs were in that
                  defective and tiresome condition. I was obliged to decline Pulsifer's generous
                  offer.</p>
               <p>I heard with singular promptness from other medical men. Fillemup &amp; Killem
                  forwarded some of their Hair Tonic, with a request for me to try it on any bald
                  heads I happened to encounter, and report. Doser &amp; Co. sent on two packages of
                  their Capillary Pills, with a suggestion to the effect that if Pitman lost his
                  hair again he would get it back finally by following the enclosed directions. I
                  also heard from Brown &amp; Bromley, the agents for Johnson's Scalp Awakener. They
                  sent me twelve bottles for distribution among my bald friends; then Smith &amp;
                  Smithson wrote<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6059-00000155"/> to say that a cask of
                  their Vesuvian Wash for the hair would be delivered in my cellar by the express
                  company; and a man called on me from Jones, Butler &amp; Co. with a proposition to
                  pump out my vinegar barrel, and fill it with Balm of Peru for the gratuitous use
                  of the afflicted in the vicinity.</p>
               <p>But this persecution was simply unalloyed felicity when compared with the
                  suffering that came in other forms. I will not attempt to give the number of the
                  letters I received. I cherish a conviction that the mail received at our
                  post-office doubled the first week after Judge Pitman's cure was announced to a
                  hairless world. I think every bald-headed man in the Tropic of Cancer must have
                  written to me at least twice upon the subject of Pulsifer's Renovator and Pitman's
                  hair. Persons dropped me a line to inquire if Pitman's baldness was hereditary;
                  and if so, if it came from his father's or his mother's side. One man, a
                  phrenologist, sent on a plaster head mapped out into town-lots, with a suggestion
                  that I should ink over the bumps that had been barest and most fertile in the case
                  of Pitman. He said he had a little theory which he wanted to demonstrate. A man in
                  San Francisco wrote to inquire if my Pitman was the same Pitman who came out to
                  California in 1849 with a bald head; and if he was, would I try to collect two
                  dollars Pitman had borrowed from him in that year? The superintendent of a
                  Sunday-school in Vermont forwarded eight pages of foolscap covered with an
                  argument supporting the theory that it was impious to attempt to force hair to
                  grow upon a head which had been made bald, because, <figure/> although Elisha was
                  bald, we find no record in the Bible that he used renovator of any kind. He warned
                  Pitman to beware of Absalom's fate, and to avoid riding mules out in the woods. A
                  woman in Snyder county, Penna., sent me a poem inspired by the incident, and
                  entitled "Lines on the Return of Pitman's Hair." A party in Kansas desired to know
                  whether I thought Pulsifer's Renovator could be used beneficially by a man who had
                  been scalped. Two men in New Jersey wrote, in a manner totally irrelevant to the
                  subject, to inquire if I could get each of them a good hired girl. I received a
                  confidential letter from a man who was willing to let me into a "good thing" if I
                  had five hundred dollars cash capital. Mrs. Singerly, of Frankford, related that
                  she had shaved her dog, and shaved him too close, and she would be relieved if I
                  would inform her if the Renovator would make hair grow on a dog. A devoted mother
                  in Rhode Island said her little boy had accidentally drank a bottle of the stuff,
                  and she would go mad unless I could assure her that there was no danger of her
                  child having his stomach choked up with hair. And over eleven hundred boys
                  inquired what effect the Renovator would have on the growth of whiskers which
                  betrayed an inclination to stagnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But the visitors were a more horrible torment. Bald men came to see me in droves.
                  They persecuted <figure/>
                  <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6059-00000156"/> me at home and abroad. If I went to
                  church, the sexton would call me out during the prayers to see a man in the
                  vestibule who wished to ascertain if Pitman merely bathed his head or rubbed the
                  medicine in with a brush. When I went to a party, some bald-headed miscreant would
                  stop me in the midst of the dance to ask if Pitman's hair began to grow in the
                  full of the moon or when it was new. While I was being shaved, some one would bolt
                  into the shop and insist, as the barber held me by the nose, upon knowing whether
                  Pitman wore ventilators in his hat. If I attended a wedding, as likely as not a
                  bare-headed outlaw would stand by me at the altar and ask if Pitman ever slept in
                  nightcaps; and more than once I was called out of bed at night by wretches who
                  wished to learn, before they left the town, if I thought it hurt the hair to part
                  it behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>It became unendurable. I issued orders to the servants to admit to the house no
                  man with a bald head. But that very day a stranger obtained admission to the
                  parlor; and when I went down to see him, he stepped softly around, closed all the
                  doors mysteriously, and asked me, in a whisper, if any one could hear us. Then he
                  pulled off a wig; and handing me a microscope, he requested me to examine his
                  scalp and tell him if there was any hope. I sent him over to see Pitman; and I
                  gloat over the fact that he bored Pitman for two hours with his baldness.</p>
               <p>I am sorry now that I ever wrote anything upon the subject of his hair. A bald
                  Pitman, I know, is less fascinating than a Pitman with hair; but rather than have
                  suffered this misery, I would prefer a Pitman without an eye-winker, or fuzz
                  enough on him to make a camel's-hair pencil. But I shall hardly give another
                  certificate of cure in any event. If I should see a patent-medicine man take a
                  mummy which died the year Joseph was sold into Egypt, and dose it until it kicked
                  off its rags and danced the polka mazourka while it whistled the tune, I would die
                  at the stake sooner than acknowledge the miracle on paper. Pitman's hair winds me
                  up as far as medical certificates are concerned.</p>
               <p>Bob has succeeded in obtaining from Mr. Magruder an explanation of the
                  interference of that stern parent with the progress of his love affair, and we
                  hope now to secure a happy adjustment of the difficulty.</p>
               <p>"When I entered the room," said Bob, "the old man looked gloomy and stiff, as if
                  he regarded me as a totally depraved being, too far gone in iniquity to be worth
                  an effort to effect a reform. I went right at him. I told him I had heard that
                  some one had made certain charges against me which were likely to hurt my
                  reputation, and that it was because of these that he had refused to permit me to
                  marry his daughter.</p>
               <p>"He said I had stated the case correctly. Then I asked him to give me the name of
                  the person who had made these<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6059-00000157"/>
                  accusations. He hesitated for a few moments, and I then declared that the charges
                  were false and slanderous, and asserted that I had a right to know who the author
                  of them was.</p>
               <p>"After thinking over the matter for a while, he said,</p>
               <p>"'Well, Mr. Parker, I believe you have that right. I have thought lately that I
                  did not perhaps treat you very fairly in not bringing you face to face in the
                  first place with the man who accused you. But I almost pledged myself to regard
                  his statements as confidential; and as the evidence seemed to be overwhelming
                  against you, I concluded not to offer you the opportunity. Mrs. Magruder takes a
                  different view of the matter. She thinks you should not be condemned without a
                  hearing, and she distrusts your accuser. His name is Smiley—Lieutenant
                  Smiley.'</p>
               <p>"Then the old man went on," said Bob, "and told me that Smiley had sought a
                  private interview with him, at which Smiley had declared that I was not only a
                  debauchee, but an atheist. He made this statement, he told Mr. Magruder, with
                  reluctance and regret, but he felt that as a friend of the family he had a duty to
                  perform which was imperative. Smiley declared that he had frequently seen me under
                  the influence of liquor, and that I had often attacked him for professing to
                  believe in the Christian religion. A splendid old professor of religion he is!"
                  exclaimed Mr. Parker. "And then," continued Bob, "Mr. Magruder said Smiley
                  produced two letters, one from a man named Dewey who pretended to be the pastor of
                  a church in Philadelphia, from which he said I was dismissed for expressing
                  atheistical opinions, and the other from a certain Samuel Stonebury, wherein
                  Samuel gave me a dreadful character for honesty and sobriety.</p>
               <p>"Thereupon I informed Mr. Magruder that I knew of no clergyman named Dewey, and
                  that I didn't believe such a man existed in Philadelphia; that I never belonged to
                  any church, and certainly was never kicked out of one because of my atheistical
                  opinions, for I never entertained such views. I informed him also that Mr.
                  Stonebury was a youth who was once employed in our store, and who was discharged
                  because I discovered that he had been stealing. How Smiley found him I can't
                  imagine. They must have had a natural tendency to gravitate toward each other as
                  children of the same old father of lies.</p>
               <p>"Then Mr. Magruder said that if I could prove these facts he would not only hand
                  Bessie over to me again, but he would also make me a very humble apology. I
                  promised to accomplish these results, and to-morrow I will set about the work. I
                  have no doubt at all that Stonebury wrote the letter signed 'Dewey,' and that
                  Smiley suggested that playful little dodge to him. I will move on Smiley's works
                  when I meet him. He is the wickedest kind of a scoundrel."</p>
               <p>And so the case of Parker <foreign xml:lang="LAT">versus</foreign> Smiley stands
                  at present. I should have a higher respect for Magruder if he had acted more
                  justly with Bob in the first place. If Mrs. Magruder's instinct and common sense
                  had not induced her to regard Smiley with suspicion, I am afraid that Bob's wrongs
                  would never have been righted. The doctor is evidently the wiser and better person
                  of the two, and I am not surprised now that she keeps her husband a little in the
                  background.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Some relatives of the Magruders named Kemper came to the village to live a few
                  weeks ago, and they rented a house not far from mine. We have a life insurance
                  agent in the town named Benjamin P.<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6059-00000158"/>
                  Gunn, and he is decidedly the most enterprising and indefatigable of the
                  fraternity of which he is a member. He has already bored everybody in the county
                  nearly to death, and it is easy to imagine the delight he feels when a new victim
                  comes within his reach. The Kempers were hardly fixed in their new home when Gunn,
                  who had been awaiting with impatience a chance to attack them, one morning called
                  for the purpose of ascertaining if he could induce Mr. Kemper to take out a policy
                  of insurance upon his life. In response to his summons Mrs. Kemper came into the
                  parlor to see him. The following conversation then ensued:</p>
               <p>"I suppose," said Gunn, "Mr. Kemper has no insurance on his life?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Mrs. Kemper.</p>
               <p>"Well, I'd like to get him to take a policy in our company. It's the safest in the
                  world—the largest capital, smallest rates and biggest dividends."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Kemper don't take much interest in such things now," said Mrs. K.</p>
               <p>"Well, madam, but he ought to, in common justice to you. No man knows when he will
                  die; and by paying a ridiculously small sum now, Mr. Kemper can leave his family
                  in affluence. I'd like to hand you, for him, a few pamphlets containing statistics
                  upon the subject; may I?"</p>
               <p>"Of course, if you wish to."</p>
               <p>"Don't you think he can be induced to insure?" asked Gunn.</p>
               <p>"I hardly think so," replied Mrs. Kemper.</p>
               <p>"He is in good health, I suppose? Has he complained lately of being sick?"</p>
               <p>"Not lately."</p>
               <p>"May I ask if he has any considerable wealth?"</p>
               <p>"Not a cent."</p>
               <p>"Then, of course, he must insure. No poor man can afford to neglect such an
                  opportunity. I suppose he travels sometimes—goes about in railroad cars and other
                  dangerous places?"</p>
               <p>"No, he keeps very quiet."</p>
               <p>"Man of steady habits, I s'pose?"</p>
               <p>"Very steady."</p>
               <p>"He is the very man I want," said Gunn. "I know I can sell him a policy."</p>
               <p>"I don't think you can," replied Mrs. Kemper.</p>
               <p>"Why? When will he be home? I'll call on him. I don't know of any reason why I
                  shouldn't insure him."</p>
               <p>"I know," replied Mrs. K.</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"He <emph>has been dead twenty-seven years!</emph>" said the widow.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Gunn said "good-morning," and returned to his office. The widow must have
                  told the story to some one, probably to Magruder, for it was soon known all over
                  town, and those who had suffered from an excess of Gunn gloried in his
                  discomfiture. As this was the first time in his career that he had ever been down,
                  it is not surprising that several of his enemies should improve the opportunity by
                  giving him a few vigorous kicks. The most venomous attack upon him, however,
                  appeared in the <title>Argus.</title> It came, I think, from that remarkable
                  medical man Dr. Tobias Jones, who dislikes Gunn because he employs a rival
                  physician, Dr. Brindley<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6059-00000159"/> ley, to examine
                  persons who apply for policies. He called the article</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>A LIFE INSURANCE AGENT.</head>
                  <p>His name was Benjamin P. Gunn, and he was the agent for a life insurance
                     company. He came around to my office fourteen times in one morning to see if he
                     could not persuade me to take out a policy. He used to waylay me on the street,
                     at church, in my own house, and bore me about that policy. If I went to the
                     opera, Gunn would buy the seat next to me, and sit there the whole evening
                     talking about sudden death and the advantages of the ten-year plan. If I got
                     into a railway car, Gunn would come rushing in and sit by my side, and drag out
                     a lot of mortality tables and begin to explain how I could gouge a fortune out
                     of his company. If I sat down to dinner in a restaurant, up would come Gunn;
                     and seizing the chair next to me, he would tell a cheering anecdote about a man
                     who insured in his company for $50,000 only last week, and was buried
                     yesterday. If I attended the funeral of a departed friend, and wept as they
                     threw the earth upon his coffin, I would hear a whisper; and turning around,
                     there would be the indomitable Benjamin P. Gunn, bursting to say, "Poor Smith!
                     Knew him well. Insured for ten thousand in our company. Widow left in
                     comfortable circumstances. Let me take your name. Shall I?"</p>
                  <p>He followed me everywhere, until at last I got so sick of Gunn's persecutions
                     that I left town suddenly one evening and hid myself in a distant city, hoping
                     to get rid of him. At the end of two weeks I returned, reaching home at one
                     o'clock in the morning. I had hardly got into bed before there was a ring at
                     the door-bell. I looked out, and there was Gunn with another person. Mr. Gunn
                     observed that he expected my return, and thought he would call around about
                     that insurance policy. He said he had the doctor with him, and if I would come
                     down he would take my name and have me examined immediately. I was too
                     indignant to reply. I <unclear>shut</unclear> the window with a slam and went
                     to bed again. After breakfast in the morning I opened the front door, and there
                     was Gunn sitting on the steps with his doctor, waiting for me. He had been
                     there all night. As I came out they seized me and tried to undress me there on
                     the pavement in order to examine me. I retreated and locked myself up in the
                     garret, with orders to admit nobody to the house until I came down stairs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Gunn wouldn't be baffled. He actually rented the house next door and
                     stationed himself in the garret adjoining mine. When he got fixed, he spent his
                     time pounding on the partition and crying, "Hallo! I say! how about that
                     policy? Want to take it out now?" And then he would tell me some more anecdotes
                     about men who were cut off immediately after paying the first premium. But I
                     paid no attention to him and made no noise. Then he was silent for a while.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suddenly the trap-door of my garret was wrenched off; and upon looking up, I
                     saw Gunn, with the doctor and a crowbar and a lot of death-rates, coming down
                     the ladder at me. I fled from the house to the Presbyterian church close by,
                     and paid the sexton twenty dollars to let me climb up to the point of the
                     steeple and sit astride of the ball. I promised him twenty more if he would
                     exclude everybody from that steeple for a week. Once safely on the ball, three
                     hundred feet from the earth, I made myself comfortable with the thought that I
                     had Gunn at a disadvantage, and I determined to beat him finally if I had to
                     stay there for a month. About an hour afterward, while I was looking at the
                        superb<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6059-00000160"/> view to the west, I heard
                     a rustling sound upon the other side of the steeple. I looked around, and there
                     was Benjamin P. Gunn creeping up the side of the spire in a balloon, in which
                     was the doctor and the tabular estimates of the losses of his company from the
                     Tontine system. As soon as Gunn reached the ball he threw his grappling-iron
                     into the shingles of the steeple, and asked me at what age my father died, and
                     if any of my aunts ever had consumption or liver complaint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without waiting to reply, I slid down the steeple to the ground and took the
                     first train for the Mississippi Valley. In two weeks I was in Mexico. I
                     determined to go to the interior and seek some wild spot in some elevated
                     region where no Gunn would ever dare to come. I mounted a mule, and paid a
                     guide to lead me to the summit of Popocatapetl. We arrived at the foot of the
                     mountain at noon. We toiled upward for about four hours. Just before reaching
                     the top I heard the sound of voices; and upon rounding a point of rocks, whom
                     should I see but Benjamin P. Gunn, seated on the very edge of the crater,
                     explaining the endowment plan to his guide and stupefying him with a mortality
                     table, while the doctor had the other guide a few yards off, examining him to
                     see if he was healthy! Mr. Gunn arose and said he was glad to see me, because
                     now we could talk over that business about the policy without fear of
                     interruption. In <figure/> a paroxysm of rage I pushed him backward into the
                     crater, and he fell a thousand feet below with a heavy thud. As he struck the
                     bottom I heard a voice screaming out something about "non-forfeiture;" but
                     there was a sudden convulsion of the mountain, a cloud of smoke, and I heard no
                     more.</p>
                  <p>But on the following Thursday an eruption began, and the first thing that was
                     thrown out was Benjamin P. Gunn, scorched, with his hair singed off and in a
                     profuse perspiration, but still active and ready for business. If I should be
                     killed, I verily believe Gunn would commit suicide in order that he might
                     follow me into the next world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of course this is mere burlesque and it is hardly fair treatment of Gunn. But I
                     am gratified to learn that such ridicule does not hurt his feelings. On the day
                     the article appeared he called to see Colonel Bangs. The colonel apprehended an
                     assault; and rallying his clerks and reporters around him, he seized a club and
                     gave orders that Gunn should be admitted. But Benjamin did not intend war. He
                     grasped the colonel's hand; and after thanking him for such a handsome
                     gratuitous advertisement, he pulled a schedule out of his pocket and argued
                     with Bangs until the latter in despair agreed to take out another policy for
                     ten thousand dollars in Gunn's company.</p>

                  <p>We do not regard Lieutenant Smiley as a very entertaining person at present,
                     and of course he is not quoted with enthusiasm. But during the prevalence of
                     the excitement<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6059-00000161"/> created by the
                     victory over Pitman's baldness, Smiley related an anecdote bearing upon the
                     subject of hair which combined instruction with amusement in a remarkable
                     degree, and it may be profitable to reproduce it here as an illustration of the
                     demoralizing tendencies of the red man.</p>
                  <p>During the recent visit of a party of Indians to the East, one of the number,
                     Squatting Bear, was observed to behave himself in a very remarkable and
                     mysterious manner. He separated himself from his companions on one occasion for
                     several hours, and was then seen returning dragging a huge Saratoga trunk
                     behind him through the streets with a string. When he reached his lodgings with
                     the trunk, the other Indians were puzzled. Some of them believed the trunk to
                     be a model for a new kind of wigwam with a Mansard roof, while others conceived
                     the idea that it was a patent bath-tub of some peculiar sort, and that
                     Squatting Bear, in a moment of mental aberration, had been seized with an
                     inexplicable and unprecedented desire to wash himself. The souls of the savages
                     burned with fiery indignation as they contemplated the possibility of the
                     adoption of this revolutionary, enervating and demoralizing practice of the
                     pale faces by the noble red man. But when they questioned Squatting Bear and
                     remonstrated with him, that incomprehensible brave merely placed his
                     copper-colored finger upon his burnt-umber nose and winked solemnly with his
                     right eye.</p>
                  <p>The trunk was carried through to the wigwam of Squatting Bear unopened, and
                     within the precincts of his home it was hidden finally from view, and was soon
                     entirely forgotten.</p>
                  <p>In the tribe the brave who killed the largest number of enemies in any given
                     year and secured the usual trophies of victory was entitled to occupy the
                     position as chief. Squatting Bear was known to have ardent aspirations for the
                     office, and he worked hard to win it. For a while after his return he was
                     always foremost in every fight; and when the scalps were counted around the
                     camp-fire, he invariably had secured the greatest number. Gradually, however,
                     certain of the braves were impressed with the notion that Squatting's trophies
                     sometimes did not bear a very correct proportion to the ferocity of the contest
                     or to the number of the slain. Several times, after a brief skirmish in which
                     ten or fifteen men were killed, Squatting would come sidling home with as many
                     scalps as there were dead men; and at the same time the other warriors would
                     together have nearly as many more.</p>
                  <p>The braves thought it was queer, but they did not give the subject very serious
                     attention until after the massacre of a certain band of emigrants which had
                     passed close by the camp of the tribe. There were just twenty persons in the
                     company, and after the butchery several Indians took the trouble to count the
                     bodies and to keep tally with a butcher-knife upon the side of a chip. That
                     night, when the scalps were numbered, each brave had one or two apiece, but
                     Squatting Bear handed out exactly forty-seven of the most beautiful bunches of
                     human hair that had ever been seen west of the Mississippi. The braves looked
                     cross-eyed at each other and cleared their throats. Two of their number stole
                     out to the battlefield for the purpose of counting the bodies again, and of
                     ascertaining if this had been a menagerie with a few double-headed persons in
                     the party.</p>
                  <p>Yes, there lay exactly twenty corpses, and, to make matters worse, one of them
                     was a bald-headed man who, for additional security to his scalp, had run a
                     skate-strap over his head and buckled it under his chin.</p>
                  <p>When they returned, the entire camp devoted itself to meditation and
                     calculation.</p>
                  <p>Twenty men killed and forty-seven scalps in the possession of a single Indian,
                     without counting those secured by other participants in the contest! The more
                     the warriors pondered over this fact, the more perplexing it became. A brave<pb
                        n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6059-00000162"/> while eating his supper and
                     reflecting upon the problem, would suddenly imagine he saw his way clear, and
                     he would stop, with his mouth full of baked dog, and fix his eyes upon the wall
                     and think desperately hard. But the solution invariably eluded him. Then all of
                     them would glide behind their wigwams and perform abstruse mathematical
                     calculations upon their fingers, and they would get sticks and jam the points
                     into the sand and do hard sums out of their aboriginal arithmetic. And they
                     would tear around through the Indian rule of three, and struggle through their
                     own kind of vulgar fractions, and wrestle with something that they believed to
                     be a multiplication table. But in vain. Forty-seven scalps off twenty heads! It
                     seemed incredible and impossible.</p>
                  <p>They tried it with algebra, and let the number of heads equal <hi rend="i"/>x
                     and the number of scalps equal <hi rend="i"/>y and they multiplied <hi rend="i"
                     />x into <hi rend="i"/>y and subtracted every letter in the alphabet in
                     succession from the result until their brains reeled; but still the mystery
                     remained unsolved.</p>
                  <p>At last a secret council was held, and it was determined that Squatting Bear
                     must have some powerful and wonderful charm which enabled him to perform such
                     miracles, and all hands agreed to investigate the matter upon the first
                     opportunity. So the next week there was another fight, in which four persons
                     were killed, and that night Squatting actually had the audacity to rush out one
                     hundred and eighty-seven scalps, and to ask those benighted savages, sitting
                     around their fire, to believe that he had snatched all that hair from those
                     four heads.</p>
                  <p>It was too much—much too much; they seized him and drove a white oak stake
                     through his bosom to hold him still, and then they proceeded to his wigwam to
                     ascertain how that scalp business was conducted by the Bear family. They burst
                     open the Saratoga trunk the first thing, and there they found fifteen hundred
                     wigs and a keg of red paint, purchased by the disgraceful aboriginal while in
                     Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>That concluded his career. They buried him at once in the Saratoga trunk, and
                     the wigs with him; and ever since that time they have elected annually a
                     committee on scalps, whose business it is to examine every hirsute trophy with
                     a double-barreled microscope of nine hundred diameters.</p>

               </p>
               <p>WHILE I was helping one of my youngsters a night or two ago to master a tough
                  little problem in his arithmetic, I picked up the history that he had been
                  studying, and as he went off to bed with the other tiny travelers up the hill of
                  knowledge, I looked through the volume. It was Goodrich's History of the United
                  States, for the use of beginners; and it had a very familiar appearance. I gained
                  my first glimpse of the past from this very book; and not only could I remember
                  the text as I turned over the leaves, but the absurd pictures of General
                  Washington and the surrender of Cornwallis, the impossible portraits of John Smith
                  and Benjamin Franklin, and the unnatural illustration of the manner in which the
                  Pilgrim Fathers landed, seemed like respectable old acquaintances whom I had known
                  and admired in happier days.</p>
               <p>The man who can find one of the books that he studied when he was a child at
                  school will experience a pleasant sensation if he will open it and look over its
                  pages. It will recall some delightful memories, and bring him very close again to
                  the almost forgotten time when that wretched little book was to him the mightiest
                  literary achievement in existence. For this reason I love Goodrich's History; and
                  I will continue to regard it with affection even though my judgment may not give
                  it approval as a work of very remarkable excellence.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Adeler descended, after tucking the weary scholars comfortably in bed, I
                  directed her attention to these facts, and to some of the peculiarities of
                  Goodrich's effort:</p>
               <p>"This little book, Mrs. A., first unlocked for me the door of history. It is a
                  history of the United States; and as it was written by a man who lived in Boston
                  and believed in Boston, it is hardly necessary to say that in my childhood I
                  obtained from the volume the impression that our beloved native land consisted
                  chiefly of Boston. I do not wish to revile that city. It is in many respects a
                  model municipality. It is, I think, better governed than any other large community
                  in the land, it has greater intellectual force than any of our cities, and its
                  people have a stronger and more demonstrative civic pride. In Boston the best men
                  are usually at the front, and the conduct of public affairs is not entrusted, as
                  it is in Philadelphia and other cities, to blackguardly politicians whom a
                  respectable man would not admit to his house, and who maintain themselves in power
                  by fraudulent elections and by stealing the people's money. Every Boston man
                  believes in the greatness of his city, and is proud of it. That is an excellent
                  condition of public sentiment, and we may pardon it even if it does sometimes
                  produce results that are slightly ridiculous.</p>
               <p>"Goodrich was what might be called an excessive Boston<pb n="326-327"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000164"/> man, and his little history is very apt,
                  unintentionally, to convey erroneous impressions to the infant mind. In my early
                  boyhood, being completely saturated with Goodrich, I entertained an indistinct
                  idea that the eye of Columbus rested upon Boston long before any other object
                  appeared above the horizon, and somehow I cherished a conviction that the natives
                  who greeted him and bowed down at his feet were men who inhabited Bunker Hill
                  Monument and disported themselves perpetually among the chambers of Faneuil Hall.
                  I never doubted that every important event in our annals, from the landing of
                  those unpleasant old Puritans of the Mayflower down to the election of Andrew
                  Jackson, occurred in Boston, and was attributable entirely to the remarkable
                  superiority of the people of that city. I scoffed at the theory that John Smith
                  was in Virginia at the time of his salvation by Pocahontas, and I was even
                  disposed to regard the account of the signing of the Declaration of Independence
                  at Philadelphia as a sort of an insignificant 'side show' which should have been
                  alluded to briefly in a foot-note. I honestly believed that the one great mistake
                  of George Washington's life was that he was born elsewhere than in Boston, and I
                  felt that, however hard such retribution might appear, he deserved to be
                  considered a little less great on account of that error.</p>
               <p>"As for the war of the Revolution, I could not doubt, while I maintained my faith
                  in Goodrich, that it was begun by the high-spirited citizens of Boston in
                  consequence of the wrongs inflicted upon them by that daring and impious monarch
                  King George III. It was equally clear that the conflict was carried on only by the
                  people of Boston, and that the victory was won at last because of the valor
                  displayed by the citizens of that community.</p>
               <p>"In my opinion, and apparently in the opinion of Goodrich, the leading event of
                  the war was that related in chapter ter eighty-five. The story occupies the whole
                  chapter. The historian evidently intended that the youthful mind, while meditating
                  upon the most important episode of the dreadful struggle, should not be disturbed
                  by minor matters. Chapter eighty-five relates that certain British soldiers
                  demolished snow hills that had been constructed by some boys upon Boston Common, a
                  hallowed spot which Goodrich taught me to regard as the pivotal point of the
                  universe. The boys determined to call upon General Gage, and to protest against
                  this brutal outrage committed by the hireling butchers of a bloated despot. Now
                  listen while I read the account of that interview as it is given by Goodrich:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"General Gage asked why so many children had called upon him. 'We come, sir,'
                     said the tallest boy, 'to demand satisfaction.' 'What!' said the general; 'have
                     your fathers been teaching you rebellion, and sent you to exhibit it here?'
                     'Nobody sent us, sir,' answered the boy, while his cheek reddened and his eye
                     flashed. 'We have never injured nor insulted your troops; but they have trodden
                     down our snow-hills and broken the ice on our skating-ground. We complained,
                     and they called us young rebels, and told us to help ourselves if we could. We
                     told the captain of this, and he laughed at us. Yesterday our works were
                     destroyed the third time, and we will bear it no longer.' General Gage looked
                     at them a moment in silent admiration, and then said to an officer at his side,
                     'The very children here draw in a love of liberty with the air they
                     breathe.'</p>
               </q>
               <p>"The story of this event, which shaped the destinies of a great nation and gave
                  liberty to a continent, I learned by heart. Many and many a night have I lain
                  awake wishing that Philadelphians would organize another war with Great Britain,
                  so that British soldiers could come over and batter down a snow hill that I would
                  build in Independence Square. I felt certain that I should go at once, in such an
                  event, to see the general, and should overwhelm him with another<pb n="328-329"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000165"/> outburst of fiery indignation. It seemed rather
                  hard that Philadelphia boys should never have a chance to surpass the boys of
                  Boston. But still I could not help admiring those young braves and regarding them
                  as the real authors of American independence. I was well assured that if that
                  'tallest boy' had not entered the general's room and flashed his eye at Gage all
                  would have been lost; the country would have been ground beneath the iron heel of
                  the oppressor, and Americans would have been worse than slaves. Perhaps it did me
                  no harm to believe all this; but it seems to me that we might as well instruct
                  children properly to begin with. Therefore I shall give our boy, Agamemnon, some
                  private lessons in history to supplement the wisdom of Goodrich."</p>
               <p>Just as I had concluded my remarks, Judge Pitman came in to ask me to let him look
                  at the evening paper which I had brought with me from the city. I explained to him
                  the nature of the subject that had been considered, and the judge, as usual, had
                  something to say about it.</p>
               <p>"Do you know," he observed, "that them school-books that they make now-a-days is
                  perfectly bewilderin' to a man like me? When I went to school, we learned nothin'
                  but readin', writin' and arithmetic. But now—well, they've got clear past me. I
                  could no more rassle with the learnin' they have at the schools now than a babe
                  unborn."</p>
               <p>"To what special department of learning do you refer?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"Oh, all of 'em, all of 'em. I had a very cur'ous experience with one o' them
                  books once," said the judge, with a laugh. "Some years ago I took a notion to jine
                  the church, an' they give me the catechism to learn afore I could git in. When I
                  got home, I laid the book away on the shelf, an' didn't go for it for two or three
                  days. When I was ready to study it up, I reached down what I thought was the
                  catechism, an' I was kinder surprised to see that it was called 'Familiar
                  Science.' You understand it was a book my daughter had been learnin' at school.
                  But I knowed no better. I never paid no 'tention to religion afore; an' although
                  it struck me as sorter queer that a catechism should have such questions and
                  answers in it, I thought the church people that give me the book must know what
                  was right, so I said nothin' an' went to work at it."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"How did you succeed?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, putty good. I learned three or four pages by heart, an' I thought that was
                  'bout enough. So after while the minister an' the rest come 'round an' begun
                  examinin' me. I noticed that the questions kinder didn't fit in, but I did my
                  best; an' when they'd ask me about the Scripters, I'd jam in somethin' about
                  carbonic acid gas, an' when they inquired about the whole duty of man, I
                  desp'rately give 'em somethin' relatin' to the functions of lightnin'-rods."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"You must have astonished them."</p>
               <p>"You never seen men wuss bewildered," replied the judge; "but I think I really
                  skeered 'em when they asked me about Solomon's temple, an' I lit out with an
                  answer referrin' to smoky chimneys. They thought I was insane. But when<pb
                     n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6059-00000166"/> I pulled out the book an' showed it to
                  'em, the preacher laughed an' told me about the mistake. Then we hunted up the
                  catechism an' got the thing straight. The church folks had the laugh on me for a
                  while, but I didn't mind it. An' it <emph>was</emph> pretty fair for a joke,
                  wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Excellent."</p>
               <p>"But I got a better one on at least one of them fellers. Doctor Brindley was on
                  the examinin' committee, an' he run me harder than any of 'em about it. Well,
                  sir—Do you know old Hillegass?"</p>
               <p>"No; I never heard of him."</p>
               <p>"He lives out yer on the Wilmington road. Well, sir, <figure/> some time afore
                  that Hillegass was putty near dead. He was the wust case I ever seen. Broken down,
                  thin an' pale, with no appetite, his lungs weak, his liver good for nothin', his
                  legs full of rheumatics, his heart affected an' his head achin' with neuralger, I
                  really believe that man was the sickest human bein' that ever breathed the breath
                  of life. All the doctors in the country had a shy at him one time an' another; an'
                  as he kep' a-gettin' wuss an' wuss, they made him mad, an' he wouldn't pay their
                  bills."</p>
               <p>"He was not much to blame for that."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not. Well, one day them doctors met, an' after talkin' the thing over
                  they agreed not to go to Hillegass's again unless he settled up, you understand.
                  They said, 'Now we'll let Hillegass die; we've fooled with him long enough. He's
                  either got to pay or perish. No more Hillegass for us unless we see some cash.' So
                  for about a year they let him alone; an' whenever one of 'em would drive past the
                  house, he would pull up for a minute, look to see if there was crape on the door,
                  an' then go on, shakin' his head an' sayin', 'Poor Hillegass! the stingy old
                  fool's not long for this world.'"</p>
               <p>"Did he die?"</p>
               <p>"Die! One day Dr. Brindley felt kinder sorry for Hillegass, an' he weakened on his
                  resolution. So he called at the house to see how he was gittin' on. As he went in
                  the yard he seen a stoutish man liftin' a bar'l of flour in a waggin. When the man
                  got the bar'l in, he seen the doctor an' come for'ard. The doctor thought he knew
                  the scar on the man's nose, but he couldn't believe it. Howsomedever, it
                     <emph>was</emph> old Hillegass, well an' hearty as a buck, an' able to h'ist
                  the roof off the barn if he'd a mind to. You understand that I had a very soft
                  thing on Brindley jes' then; an' he <figure/>
                  <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6059-00000167"/> never seemed to take no furder
                  interest in the catechism business when he met me. An' they don't encourage
                  doctors much out that way now; no, sir. They trust to luck an' natur', which in my
                  opinion is the best way, anyhow."</p>
               <p>"A great many remarkable things seem to have happened in this place," I said.</p>
               <p>"Yes," responded the judge. "You'd hardly think it of such a quiet town as this
                  'pears to be; but somehow there's 'most always somethin' lively goin' on. There
                  was that fuss 'round at Dr. Hopkins's a couple o' year ago; did you hear 'bout
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Not that I know of."</p>
               <p>"Well, we'd jes' got a new fire-engine in the town, an' the men that run her
                  thought they'd play a little joke on the chief of the department by rushin' 'round
                  to his house an' pretendin' it was afire. By a most unfort'nit circumstance, the
                  chief moved out of the house that mornin', and Dr. Hopkins—the preacher, you
                  know—moved in. Them fellers come a-peltin' 'round with the engine, an' they run up
                  their ladders an' begun a-playin' on the roof in a manner that skeered the
                  Hopkinses nearly to death. But the other fire company thought there really was a
                  fire, an' they come out with their engine an' begun to squirt on the house. The
                  others tried to explain how it was, but the new-comers wouldn't believe 'em, an'
                  they kep' a-pourin' water into the winders an' a carryin' on like mad. So at last
                  they got up a fight, an' they fought all <figure/>
                  <figure/> over the house an' on the stairs an' up an' down the entries, until Dr.
                  Hopkins was putty near insane; an' when they went home, he counted up about two
                  hundred dollars damages, which them fellers had to pay. Yes, it is astonishin' how
                  they used to keep things a-movin' in this town. An' now I really must be goin'.
                  I'll send back the paper the fust thing in the mornin', for certain."</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>The judge then went home; and just as he passed out of the door Bob Parker came in
                  with a radiant countenance. He had succeeded in obtaining the evidence that was
                  needed for his vindication.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>MR. PARKER had good reason for exultation. He had in his possession testimony
                  which exposed and completely defeated the wretched little conspiracy organized
                  against him by Smiley.</p>
               <p>"It was a very easy thing to settle this business," said Bob. "I explained the
                  matter to the members of our firm, and they not only gave me a letter containing
                  very strong expressions of confidence in me and denouncing Stone-bury as a wholly
                  untrustworthy and disreputable person, but they insisted that I should make
                  Stonebury confess. Accordingly, a member of the firm accompanied me while I hunted
                  him up. We found that he had a clerkship in one of the municipal offices, and we
                  called to see him. He turned absolutely white when he saw me, and looked as if he
                  would like to beat a retreat. But we went at him, and threatened that if he did
                  not acknowledge in writing that he had maligned me we would prosecute him for the
                  theft committed while he was engaged at the store, and have him ousted from his
                  present position.</p>
               <p>"He came down at once, and began to excuse his conduct upon the ground that Smiley
                  had compelled him to do as he did. Then he made a written confession that his
                  statements concerning me were lies, and that he was the real author of the letter
                  which professed to come from Rev. Dr. Dewey. Here it is—here are both letters; and
                  I propose to enlighten the Magruder intellect with them this very night."</p>
               <p>"Wouldn't it be better to wait until to-morrow? It is rather late now."</p>
               <p>"No, sir. I intend to settle the affair finally and for ever before I go to bed. I
                  have been waiting long enough. Now I am going to enjoy my victory without further
                  delay. Let's go around there at once."</p>
               <p>So Bob and I started for the Magruder mansion; and when we reached the street, he
                  strode along at such a rapid gait that I could hardly keep up with him. As we
                  approached the house I ventured to suggest that the dog might perhaps be at large,
                  in which event I thought I would rather remain in the drug store on the other side
                  of the street until he returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"I would go into the house," exclaimed Bob, "if there were a million bloodhounds
                  tearing around the front yard."</p>
               <p>"Well, I believe I wouldn't. I have less enthusiasm than you. I am growing old and
                  cautious. A much smaller quantity of bloodhound would restrain what little
                  impetuosity I have. Only one vigorous bloodhound stationed in that yard and
                  betraying a disposition to exclude me would dampen my ardor. I should go home at
                  once."</p>
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6059-00000169"/>
               <p>"Magruder's dog won't bite," said Bob. "He knows me well, and we needn't be a bit
                  afraid of him."</p>
               <p>"Very well, I will run the risk; but if any accident occurs, I shall blame you for
                  it. I would rather you should lose your lady-love than that I should be deprived
                  of the use of my legs."</p>
               <p>"And, of course, I wouldn't. But come along, and never mind the dog."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>As we entered the gate the dog was there, and he followed us upon the porch, still
                  manifesting intense eagerness to sniff our trowsers. It is remarkable with what
                  carefulness and steadiness a man walks under such circumstances. I would not have
                  made a sudden jump or a quick movement of any kind for a valuable
                  consideration.</p>
               <p>When we entered the house, Mr. Magruder met us, and we went with him into the
                  library, where Mrs. Magruder was sitting with a book in her hand. We obtained a
                  glimpse of Bessie as she vanished through the other door into the next room; and
                  Bob seemed to feel a little disappointed that she had not remained. Mr. Magruder
                  began the conversation:</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Parker, I trust you have been successful in your efforts?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied Bob. "I have accomplished all that I hoped for. I have, I
                  think, procured evidence which will vindicate me completely and prove that I have
                  been grossly slandered."</p>
               <p>"I hope this is the case," said Mr. Magruder. "What is the nature of your—"</p>
               <p>"Here are two letters. This one is from one of my employers. The other is written
                  by Samuel Stonebury, a man whose name at least is known to you."</p>
               <p>Magruder took the papers and read them aloud, so that his wife might obtain the
                  information supplied by them. Then, as he slowly folded them up, he said:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Parker, this does indeed seem to be conclusive. I blame myself very much for
                  having reposed confidence in Smiley and in his villainous friend, but more than
                  all because I treated you as if you were guilty before I heard you in your own
                  defence. I owe you a very humble apology, sir, and I now make it. I hope you will
                  forgive me;" and Magruder extended his hand.</p>
               <p>"I believed in you from the first," said Mrs. Magruder.</p>
               <p>"And I thank you for it," replied Bob.</p>
               <p>"I suppose Bessie might as well come in now, my dear," said Mr. Magruder.</p>
               <p>"Certainly," replied his wife, and she called Bessie.</p>
               <p>Bessie had evidently been listening upon the other side of the door, for she
                  entered instantly, with her smiling face rosy with blushes. Bob merely took her
                  hand, and stood by her looking as if he would like to indulge in a tenderer
                  demonstration. Then I announced my intention to go home, and as I did so Bob said
                  he believed he would stay a little longer. Mr. and Mrs. Magruder came out with me
                  into the hall to say good-bye, and as the library-door closed I thought I heard
                  the sound of a kiss. I hope the old people went into the parlor or retired to bed
                  after my departure. There had been a cruel separation of the two lovers, and a
                  good deal of genuine suffering, at least upon Bessie's part, and it was but fair
                  that they should have a chance to enjoy to the very utmost, without the intrusion
                  of another person, the bliss of that reunion.</p>
               <p>Upon the day following this reconciliation Smiley was in town, and he called at
                  Magruder's. The old gentleman saw him coming, and met him at the door. In reply to
                  Smiley's salutation Magruder looked sternly at him, and after telling him that his
                  villainy had been exposed, the indignant man<pb n="338-339"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000170"/> ordered the lieutenant to leave his house and never
                  to enter it again. Smiley turned upon his heel and slunk away. We have probably
                  seen the last of him; and just as he has disappeared we have learned that he is
                  likely to be cashiered from the army for bad conduct. His brother officers at the
                  fort have discovered his true character just as it has been revealed to us.</p>
               <p>This rambling narrative would not deserve to be received as a faithful record of
                  events that have occurred in our neighborhood if it should fail to include an
                  account of the extraordinary circumstances attending what is known here as "The
                  Great Cooley Inquest." The story of that remarkable business must be given even if
                  it shall be introduced with abruptness.</p>
               <p>My neighbor William Cooley had a brother named Thomas, who lived at a place called
                  Vandyke, in New Castle county. Thomas Cooley was in some respects a very
                  remarkable man. He was gifted with genius, but it was genius of an impracticable
                  kind. He was an inventor, and during the later years of his life he devoted all
                  his time to the work of constructing surprising machines which would never do
                  anything when they were constructed.</p>
               <p>Down at the patent-office they got so at last that when a new model and
                  specifications would come along from Cooley, the commissioner and clerks would
                  grant him a patent on the spot, for they knew, from a rich and generous
                  experience, that when Cooley invented anything it was perfectly certain to be
                  unlike any other contrivance ever conceived by the mind of fallen man; and they
                  were aware, at any rate, that nobody who was sane enough to be at large would ever
                  want to interfere with Cooley's exclusive right to pin together such a bewildering
                  and useless lot of cranks and axles and wheels. I think Cooley had about two
                  hundred patents of various kinds; and besides the machines and dodges thus
                  protected by the law, he owned scores of others which were never heard of in
                  Washington or anywhere else but at Cooley's home.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Cooley had a kind of "den" of his own in the garret. He used to shut himself up in
                  this for hours together while he perfected his inventions or conducted his
                  chemical investigations. His last idea was that he could put together a compound
                  which would rule gunpowder out of the market, and make the destruction of armies
                  and navies comparatively easy. And so, for a time, Mrs. Cooley, while bustling
                  about in the vicinity of the den, instead of hearing the buzz and hum of wheels
                  and the click of the hammer, would sniff terrific smells, evolved by the
                  irrepressible Cooley from the contents of his laboratory. And one day there came a
                  fearful explosion. The roof was torn off and reduced to splinters, and Thomas
                  Cooley had disappeared.</p>
               <p>Vandyke, as I have said, is in New Castle county, Delaware, but it is also close
                  to the boundary line between Delaware and the counties of Cecil and Kent, in
                  Maryland.</p>
               <p>And so it was not surprising when, a few minutes after the explosion, persons in
                  all three of the counties perceived fragments of a demoralized and disintegrated
                  human being tumbling from the air. The pieces of the unhappy victim of the
                  disaster were unevenly distributed between New Castle, Cecil and Kent. The first
                  named got twelve of the fragments. There were persons who thought Cooley might
                  have showed even greater partiality for his own county, but I do not blame him; he
                  was in a measure controlled by circumstances.</p>
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6059-00000171"/>
               <p>I think the friends of the coroner complained with greatest bitterness. He was an
                  enthusiastic coroner. He had been known, when one of Dr. Tobias Jones's relatives
                  returned from Egypt with a mummy embalmed fifteen hundred years before the
                  Christian era, to seize that ancient subject of Pharaoh and summon a jury, and sit
                  upon it, and brood over it and think. And it is rumored that he put that jury up
                  to bringing in a verdict, "The death of the deceased ensued from cause or causes
                  unknown, at the hands of persons also unknown." His enemies at the next election
                  openly asserted that he charged the county with the usual fee, with compound
                  interest from the time of Moses.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>So of course when Thomas Cooley went up, <emph>he</emph> wasn't sorry; and the
                  more Cooley was scattered over New Castle county, the more serene and affable the
                  coroner felt. When he had selected his jury and looked around him a little in
                  order to command the situation, he perceived that Cooley had put into his hands a
                  tolerably good thing. The coroner spent the next three days holding an inquest
                  upon each of the twelve fragments of the deceased. He empaneled a new jury every
                  time, and then proceeded cautiously and deliberately in each case.</p>
               <p>There was by no means complete unanimity of opinion. The first jury decided that
                  "the deceased met his death by being struck by something sudden." The second one
                  advanced vanced the theory that "Thomas Cooley was surreptitiously and insidiously
                  blowed apart." The others threw out suggestions respecting the probability that
                  the trouble came from Cooley's well-known weakness for flying machines, or from
                  his being lifted out and cut up by some kind of a hurricane. Once the jury decided
                  not to bring in a verdict, but merely to pass resolutions of regret.</p>
               <p>And the coroner would sit there over the particular piece of Cooley in question,
                  and smile and permit these manifestations of generous feeling to have full play.
                  It didn't perplex <emph>him</emph> that all the verdicts differed. "Truth," he
                  remarked to a friend, "is well enough. But as Cooley is certainly dead, what's the
                  odds if we can't agree as to what killed him? Let us collect our fees and yield
                  with Christian resignation to destiny."</p>
               <p>It was always interesting to me to hear that coroner converse upon the subject of
                  resignation. He would rather have died than to have resigned while any of the
                  Cooleys were in town inventing explosive compounds.</p>
               <p>The Cecil county coroner discovered six pieces of the deceased within his
                  jurisdiction, but his pride would not permit him to yield the supremacy in such a
                  matter to his rival over the line. The New Castle man had twelve inquests, and so
                  would he, with more besides. And his juries used to go out and consult and come in
                  after a while with a majority report, declaring, perhaps, that deceased was killed
                  by fooling with some sort of a gun, and a minority report insisting that he had
                  been murdered and dissected by a medical student or students unknown.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>And then the coroner would disband the inquest and drum up a fresh jury, which
                  would also disagree, until out of those six fractions of poor old Cooley the
                  coroner got thirty-seven deliberations, with the attendant fees. And every time
                  the doctors would testify<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6059-00000172"/> that <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">post-mortem</foreign> examinations revealed the fact that the
                  inside of the deceased was crammed with fragments of the Latin language; and
                  invariably the jurors would sit there and try to look as if they understood those
                  terms, although a dim impression prevailed most of the time that the physicians
                  were indulging recklessly in profanity.</p>
               <p>And when a relative of Cooley's testified before the thirty-seventh jury that
                  "Thomas Cooley was a man of marked idiosyncrasies, and his brain was always
                  excited by his irresistible fondness for chimeras of various kinds," the jury
                  looked solemn and immediately brought in a verdict that "death was caused by
                  idiosyncrasies forming on his brain in consequence of excessive indulgence in
                  chimeras, thus supplying an awful warning to the young to refrain from the use of
                  that and other intoxicating beverages."</p>
               <p>Only two pieces fell in Kent county, but the coroner was animated by even greater
                  professional enthusiasm than his neighbors across the border. He spent the entire
                  season over as much of Cooley as he could reach. All his juries but one disagreed,
                  and he had eighty-four. The sixth would have been unanimous but for an obstinate
                  man named Selfridge. All the others were for a verdict of mysterious butchery, but
                  Selfridge insisted upon attributing the disaster to nitro-glycerine. So earnest
                  was he that he fought over the subject with a fellow-juryman named Smith; and he
                  held Smith down and remonstrated with him, and showed him the matter in different
                  lights, and bit his nose to convince Smith that <figure/> the nitro-glycerine
                  hypothesis was correct. And when the jury was dismissed, Selfridge, true to his
                  solemn convictions, carried the war into the papers, and published an obituary
                  poem entitled "A Monody on the Death of Thomas Cooley," in which he presented his
                  views in this fashion: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"When Cooley got his glycerine all properly adjusted,</l>
                        <l>He knocked it unexpectedly, and suddenly it busted;</l>
                        <l>And when it reached old Thomas C., he got up quick and dusted,</l>
                        <l>And left his wife and family disheartened and disgusted."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It was discovered that one of the bones of the deceased had fallen directly across
                  the boundary line between Cecil and Kent. As soon as the fact was reported, the
                  coroner of Kent rallied a jury upon his end; and just as the proceedings were
                  about to begin, the Cecil coroner arrived with a jury for the purpose of attending
                  to his share of the work. While the authorities of Kent mused at one end of the
                  bone, the jurymen of Cecil reflected at the other end, and the result <figure/>
                  was that each brought in an entirely different verdict. But they were unanimous on
                  the question of the collection of fees.</p>
               <p>In all there were thirteen or fourteen conflicting verdicts rendered, and so some
                  uncertainty prevailed as to the precise cause of Cooley's death. Men's minds were
                  unsettled, and their conclusions were demoralized, in the presence of so much
                  official authority of an indecisive kind. But nobody mourned over these
                  differences. They were a blessing for the people of the counties. Almost every man
                  in the<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6059-00000173"/> neighborhood had had a turn at
                  Cooley's remains, and some of them had served on the juries six or seven times.
                  The farmers all bought new mowing-machines that spring with their fees. The
                  doctors collected more money for <foreign xml:lang="LAT">post-mortem</foreign>
                  examinations than they would have done in a time of an epidemic of small-pox and
                  sudden death. People fixed up their houses and paid off mortgages and laid in
                  their pork and started grocery stores and gave hops out of the profits of Cooley's
                  explosion. And there were men who cherished a wish that Cooley could be put
                  together again and exploded once a month for the next decade. But that of course
                  was impossible.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>One day, when the tide of prosperity was at its height, the widow Cooley perceived
                  a wagon driving up to her door. The man within the vehicle dismounted, and
                  unloaded four pieces of iron pipe sixty feet long. Presently another wagon
                  arrived, and this driver also unloaded the same quantity of pipe. Then a third
                  driver arrived and did the same thing. Then a fourth came, and Mrs. Cooley saw a
                  man in it with a queer-looking object by him. It proved to be Thomas Cooley
                  himself. Thomas had been up to the city at a machine-shop getting up a working
                  model of a new kind of a patent duplex elliptic artesian pump; and now he was home
                  again. The remains scattered over the counties were—so Cooley said—merely a lot of
                  beef with which he had been trying to make a new kind of patent portable soup and
                  an improved imperishable army sausage; and the explosion, he thought, must have
                  been caused by spontaneous combustion.</p>
               <p>Thomas Cooley would have been happy, after all, but for one thing—everybody
                  outside of his own family refused to recognize him as a living man. If he was
                  willing to move about in the community in the character of an unburied corpse, the
                  people would agree not to interfere and not to insist upon his burial; but that
                  was as far as they could go conscientiously. Their duty to society, their
                  obligations to the law, compelled them to reject the idea that he was anything
                  more than inanimate remains. He was officially dead. The fact had been declared
                  under oath by hundreds of jurymen, and it was registered in the records of two
                  States and three counties. The testimony was overwhelmingly against him. To admit
                  that he was still alive would be dangerous, it would be revolutionary. The
                  foundations of society would be shaken, the majesty of the law would suffer
                  insult, the fabric of republican government would be undermined. If a being who
                  was legally only a mere cadaver was to be permitted to strut out into daylight,
                  and to urge incendiary theories about the condition of his vital spark, nothing
                  would be safe; there would be no guarantee that the cemeteries would not unload,
                  and that all of the departed would not be crowding out and wanting to vote.
                  Besides, if it was admitted<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6059-00000174"/> mitted that
                  Cooley was yet alive, all the money that had been earned by the jurymen, all the
                  fees that had been charged by the coroners, would have to be returned to the
                  county treasuries. The people were aghast at the thought. The coroners entered
                  into a solemn compact to persist in ignoring Cooley or to regard him merely as an
                  absurd and very indelicate goblin who had behaved in a manner wholly unworthy of a
                  ghost with gentlemanly instincts. They declared publicly that they could not admit
                  that Cooley was alive unless there should be a general resurrection in the States
                  of Delaware and Maryland, and until that time arrived, they considered that the
                  best thing Cooley could do would be to select a sepulchre somewhere and creep into
                  it and behave.</p>
               <p>I do not know that I can find a better place than this to insert a bundle of
                  rhymes which I have at hand. The wholesale slaughter in which the hero and heroine
                  indulge seems to entitle the poem to association with the three coroners above
                  mentioned. And I may venture to remark that not one of the officials in question
                  will read the lines without a feeling of profound regret that such magnificent
                  opportunities for inquests are hardly likely to be presented in Maryland and
                  Delaware. Our New Castle coroner would accumulate millions in the shape of fees if
                  he could have the privilege of summoning juries to investigate such a butchery as
                  this.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>A VERY mysterious package came to me through the post-office yesterday. I brought
                  it home unopened, and, as is usual in such cases, we began to speculate upon the
                  nature of the contents before we broke the seals. Everybody has a disposition to
                  dally for a while with a letter or a package from an unknown source. Mrs. Adeler
                  felt the parcel carefully, and said she was sure it was something from her
                  aunt—something for the baby, probably. Bob imagined that it was an infernal
                  machine forwarded by the revengeful Stonebury, and he insisted that I should put
                  it to soak in a bucket of water for a few hours before removing the wrapper. The
                  children were hopeful that some benign fairy had adopted this method of supplying
                  the Adeler family with supernatural confectionery; and for my part, I had no doubt
                  that some one of my friends among the publishers had sent me half a dozen of the
                  latest books.</p>
               <p>We opened the bundle gradually. When the outside casing was torn away, another
                  envelope remained, and as this was slowly removed the excitement and curiosity
                  reached an almost painful degree of intensity. At last all the papers were taken
                  off, and I lifted from among them a large black volume. It was only a
                  patent-office report sent to me by that incorruptible statesman and devoted
                  patriot, the Congressman from our State.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I have endeavored to conjecture why he should have selected me as the object of
                  such a demonstration. Certainly he did not expect me to read the report. He knows
                  that I, as a man of at least ordinary intelligence, would endure torture first. I
                  cannot think that he hoped to purchase my vote by such a cheap expedient.
                  Congressmen do, I believe, still cherish the theory that the present of a
                  patent-office report to a constituent secures for the donor the fealty of the
                  recipient; but it is a delusion. Such a gift fills the soul of an unoffending man
                  with gloomy and murderous thoughts. Every one feels at times as if he would like
                  to butcher some of his fellow-men; and my appetite for slaughter only becomes keen
                  when I meet a Congressman who has sent me a patent-office report. Neither can I
                  accept the suggestion that my representative was deceived by the supposition that
                  I would be grateful for such an intimation that an eminent man, even amid the
                  oppressive cares of State, has not forgotten so humble a worm as I. He knows me
                  well; and although I am aware that there is in Washington a prevalent theory that
                  a wild thrill of exultation agitates the heart of a constituent when he receives
                     a<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6059-00000177"/> public document or a flatulent
                  oration from a lawmaker, my Congressman is better informed. He would not insult me
                  in such a manner. I can only account for his conduct upon the theory that he
                  misdirected the volume, which he intended for some one else, or upon the
                  supposition that he has heard me speak of the necessity for the occasional
                  bombardment of Cooley's dog at night, and he conceived that he would be helping a
                  good cause by supplying me with a new and formidable missile. I have never
                  attacked a dog with a patent-office report, but I can imagine that the animal
                  might readily be slain with such a weapon. A projectile should have ponderosity;
                  and a patent-office report has more of that quality to the cubic inch than any
                  other object with which I am familiar. Still, I do not care to tax the treasury of
                  the United States for material with which to assail Cooley's dog. I would rather
                  endure the nocturnal ululations, and have the money applied to the liquidation of
                  the national debt.</p>
               <p>It is, however, apparent that Congressmen will never surrender the patent-office
                  report; and if this is admitted, it seems to me that the man who succeeds in
                  infusing into those volumes such an amount of interest that people will be induced
                  to read them will have a right to be regarded as a great public benefactor. I
                  suppose no human being ever did read one of them. It is tolerably certain that any
                  man who would deliberately undertake to peruse one from beginning to end would be
                  regarded as a person who ought not to be at large. His friends would be justified
                  in placing him in an asylum. I think I can suggest a method by which a reform can
                  be effected. It is to take the material that comes to hand each year and to work
                  it up into a continuous story, which may be filled in with tragedy and sentiment
                  and humor.</p>
               <p>For instance, if a man came prowling around the patent-office office with an
                  improvement in hayrakes, I should name that man Alphonso and start him off in the
                  story as the <figure/> abandoned villain; Alphonso lying in wait, as it were,
                  behind a dark corner, for the purpose of scooping his rival with that improved
                  hay-rake. And then the hero would be a man, suppose we say, who desired an
                  extension of a patent on accordeons. I should call such a person Lucullus, and
                  plant him, with a working model of the accordeon, under the window of the
                  boarding-house where the heroine, Amelia, who would be a woman who had applied for
                  a patent on a new kind of red flannel frills, lay sleeping under the soothing
                  influence of the tunes squeezed from the accordeon of Lucullus.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>In the midst of the serenade, let us suppose, in comes a man who has just got out
                  some extraordinary kind of a fowling-piece about which he wants to interview the
                  head of the<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6059-00000178"/> department. I should make
                  this being Amelia's father and call him Smith, because that name is full of poetry
                  and sweetness and wild, unearthly music. Then, while Lucullus was mashing out
                  delicious strains, I might make Alphonso rush on Smith with his hay-rake, thinking
                  he was Lucullus, and in the fight which would perhaps ensue Smith might blow out
                  Alphonso's brains somehow on the spot by a single discharge, we might assume, of
                  Smith's extraordinary fowling-piece, while Lucullus could be arrested upon the
                  suit of the composer who had a copyright on the tune with which he solaced
                  Amelia.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>If any ingenious undertaker should haunt the patent-office at this crisis of the
                  story with a species of metallic coffin, I might lay Alphonso away comfortably in
                  one of them and have a funeral, or I might add a thrill of interest to the
                  narrative by resuscitating him with vegetable pills, in case any benefactor of the
                  race should call to secure his rights as the sole manufacturer of such articles.
                  In the mean time, Lucullus, languishing in jail, could very readily burst his
                  fetters and regain his liberty, provided some man of inventive talent called on
                  the commissioner to take out searches, say, on some kind of a revertible
                  crowbar.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Then the interest of the story would be sustained, and a few more machines of
                  various kinds could be worked in, if, for instance, I should cause this escaped
                  convict of mine to ascertain that the musical composer had won the heart of
                  Amelia, in the absence of her lover, by offering to bring her flannel frills into
                  market, and to allow her a royalty. we will assume, of ten cents a frill. When
                  Lucullus hears of this, I should induce him to try to obtain the influence of
                  Amelia's parents in his behalf by propitiating old Mr. Smith with the latest
                  variety of bunion plaster for which a patent was wanted, while Mrs. Smith could be
                  appeased either with a gingham umbrella with an improvement of six or seven extra
                  ribs, or else a lot of galvanized gum rings, if any inventor brought such things
                  around, for her grandchildren.</p>
               <p>Then, for the sake of breaking the monotony of these intrigues, we could have a
                  little more of the revivified Alphonso. I could very readily fill the heart of
                  that reanimated corpse with baffled rage, and cause him to sell to old Smith one
                  of McBride's improved hydraulic rams. Smith could be depicted as an infatuated
                  being who placed that ram down in the meadow and caused it to force water up to
                  <figure/> his house. And Alphonso, of course, with malignant hatred in his soul,
                  would meddle with the machine, and fumble around until he spoiled it, so that
                  Smith could not stop it<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6059-00000179"/> and it would
                  continue to pump until the Smiths had a cascade flowing from their attic window.
                  Mrs. Smith, in her despair, might impale herself on a variety of reversible
                  toasting-fork, and die mingling the inventor's name with maledictions and groans,
                  while Smith, in the anguish of his soul, could live in the barn, from whence he
                  could use an ingenious kind of breech-loading gun—patent applied for—to perforate
                  artists who came around to sketch the falls.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Lucullus might come to the rescue with a suction pump and save
                  the Smith mansion, only to find that Amelia had flown with the composer, and had
                  gone to sea in a ship with a patent copper bottom, and a kind of a binnacle for
                  which an extension had been granted by Congress on the 26th of February. It would
                  then be well, perhaps, to have that copper-bottomed ship attacked by pirates, and
                  after a bloody hand-to-hand contest, in which the composer could sink the pirate
                  craft with the model of a gun-powder pile-driver which he has in the cabin, the
                  enraged corsairs should swarm upon the deck of the other ship for the purpose of
                  putting the whole party to the sword. And, of course, at this painful crisis it
                  would be singularly happy to cause it to turn out that the chief pirate is our old
                  friend Alphonso, who had sold out his interest in his hay-rake, discontinued his
                  speculations in hydraulic rams and become a rover upon the seas.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The composer, it would seem, would then be in a particularly tight place; and if
                  the commissioner of patents had any romance in his soul, he would permit me to
                  cause that pirate to toss the musician overboard. Amelia would then tear herself
                  from the pirate's loathsome embrace and plunge in after him. The two would float
                  ashore on a life-raft, if any applications of that kind happened to be presented
                  to the department. When they got to land, Amelia would shiver with cold until her
                  jaws rattled, and the painful truth would be disclosed to her lover that she wore
                  teeth which were attached to one of the gutta-percha plates about which there was
                  a controversy in the courts.</p>
               <p>Then, if we seemed to be approaching the end of the report, I think I would cause
                  the composer to shriek "False! false!" or to use some exciting language of that
                  kind, and to tear out his hair and wring his nose and fly off with a broken heart
                  and a blasted life to join the pirates and to play melancholy airs in a minor key,
                  expressive of delusive dreams, for ever and for ever, upon some kind of a
                  double-barreled flute with a copyright on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Thus even the prosaic material of which the patent-office reports are constructed
                  could be made to yield entertainment and instruction, and afford a basis of
                  succulent and suggestive fact for a superstructure of pathetic and blood-curdling
                  fiction. The advantages of adopting such a method in constructing these documents
                  would be especially marked in the case of Congressmen. The member who now sends a
                  patent-office report to one of his constituents is regarded by that man as a kind
                  of moral ruin who ought to be put in some place where it would be impossible for
                  him to destroy the happiness and poison the peace of unoffending families. But
                  when a competent novelist prepares those reports, when he throws over them the

               <p>Here is the story of a tragical event of which I was a witness, and which has
                  created a profound impression upon the people of this community.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>An aunt of Bessie Magruder's lives at Salem; and as she had never seen Bob, she
                  invited him and his betrothed to visit her one day last week, coupling the
                  invitation with a request that we and the elder Magruders would come at the same
                  time and take dinner with her. When the boat from up the river arrived at New
                  Castle, the entire party of us went aboard. As the steamer shot across the water
                  to Delaware City, Bob and Bessie wandered away by themselves, while the rest of us
                  passed the time pleasantly in conversation. At Delaware City we came out of the
                  cabin to watch the people as they passed over the gangway. To our surprise and
                  vexation, Lieutenant Smiley appeared among them. As he pressed forward in the
                  throng some one jostled him roughly, when he uttered a fierce oath and aimed a
                  blow at the offender. It missed the mark, and he plunged forward heavily. He would
                  have fallen had not one of the boat's crew caught him in his arms. We saw then
                  that he was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>I watched Bob as he looked at the wretched man. His face flushed with indignation
                  as he recalled the injury done to him by Smiley, and he looked as if he would have
                  found intense satisfaction in an attempt to give the lieutenant a thrashing on the
                  spot. But he did not contemplate such a performance, and Bessie clung tightly to
                  his arm, half afraid that he might have a sudden and irresistible impulse to
                  revenge, and half afraid lest Smiley might make some shocking demonstration
                  against the party in that public place. As he staggered past us he recognized us;
                  and, brutalized as he was with liquor, he seemed to feel the shame of his
                  condition and the infamy of his past conduct. He went away to the other side of
                  the boat and concealed himself from view.</p>
               <p>When the vessel left the wharf and proceeded down the bay, past the fort, we
                  walked about the lower deck, looking at the scenery and at the shipping which
                  thronged the water. No one of us perceived Smiley or knew that he was near us. We
                  had, indeed, suffered ourselves to forget the scene we had just witnessed, and we
                  were speaking of other matters. As I stood by the railing with my wife and the
                  Magruders, Bob and Bessie came out from the cabin, and Bob had just spoken one
                  word, when a man came with a hurried and uneven step to the gangway. It was
                  Smiley. He had been sitting in the corner behind one of the beams of the boat,
                  with his hat pulled over his eyes. The rail at the gangway swings aside to admit
                  of passage to and from the wharf. Now it opened out upon the water. Smiley paused
                  for one moment, with his fingers clenched upon it; then he flung it wide open, and
                  leaped forward into the sea.</p>
               <p>A cry of horror came from the lips of those who saw him make the plunge, and
                  instantly the steamer resounded with screams for help. Before any of us could
                  recover from the<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6059-00000181"/> paralysis of terror
                  occasioned by the act, Smiley rose to the surface far away from the boat, and with
                  a shriek so awful, so full of agony and despair, that it chilled the blood of
                  those <figure/> who heard it, he threw up his arms and sank. In a second Bob
                  tossed off his coat, and before I could restrain him he leaped into the water. He
                  rose instantly, and struck out boldly in the direction in which Smiley had been
                  seen.</p>
               <p>Bessie almost fainted in her father's arms, and Mrs. Adeler was white with fear.
                  The next moment the steamer stopped, and an attempt was made to lower the boat.
                  The operation required time; and meanwhile, Bob, who is a good swimmer, gallantly
                  cleft his way through the waves. I think Smiley never rose again. For as I entered
                  the lifeboat boat I could see Bob turning about and endeavoring to swim toward the
                  steamer. He was a long way from us, for the vessel had gone far before her headway
                  could be overcome. Our boatmen pulled with desperate energy lest the brave fellow
                  should be unable to sustain himself; and as I stood in the stern and watched him
                  with eager eyes, I could see that he gave signs of being in distress. It was heavy
                  work in the water, with his clothing on, and the sea was rough. We were within a
                  hundred yards of him when he sank, and I felt my heart grow sick as I saw him
                  dragged beneath the waves.</p>
               <p>But as we reached the spot one of the men, who was leaning over the side, uttered
                  an exclamation; and extending his arms, he pulled the lad's head and shoulders
                  above the surface. A moment later he was in the boat, but insensible. As we turned
                  about to seek the steamer, we rubbed his hands and his temples and strove to bring
                  him back to life, and we seemed to have partial success.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But when we reached the vessel and placed him upon the cushions in the cabin, we
                  committed him to better hands than ours. Mrs. Magruder's medical skill then was of
                  the highest service. She cared for the poor lad with a motherly tenderness which
                  was as admirable as her art. In a brief while he revived; and though suffering
                  greatly, he seemed sure of life. It would have made him blush, even in his
                  weakness, to have heard<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6059-00000182"/> the praises
                  heaped upon him for his splendid courage; we rejoiced at them, but we rejoiced
                  more to think how he had avenged himself upon his enemy by an act of sublime
                  self-sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>And so, as he came back to consciousness, we neared our journey's end; and while
                  we carried Bob from the boat to the carriage and placed him among his loving
                  friends, we shuddered to think how the wretched man who had wrought so much evil
                  was even now sweeping past us in the embrace of that swift current to burial
                  beneath the rolling billows of the sea.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>SOME of the friends of Judge Pitman induced him, just before the last election, to
                  permit himself to be nominated for the State Legislature, and accordingly he was
                  presented to the people of this community as a candidate. Of course he was not
                  selected because of his fitness for the position. The party managers knew him to
                  be a very popular man; and as the success of the party is the only thing they care
                  for, they chose Pitman as the person most likely to secure that result. I cannot
                  say that I disapproved of the selection. For some reason, it appears to be
                  entirely impossible for American citizens who live in any of the Middle States to
                  find educated and intelligent men who are willing to represent them in the
                  Legislatures. Those bodies are composed for the most part of men whose solitary
                  purpose is plunder.<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6059-00000183"/> They are
                  legislators simply because it pays better to black-mail railroad companies and to
                  accept bribes from people who want votes for rascally measures than it does to
                  pick pockets. The have the instincts and the principles of a pickpocket, but their
                  ambition is greater. They do not steal handkerchiefs and watches, because they can
                  filch fabulous sums of money from the public treasury and from villains who want
                  to do dirty work under the color of the law. They know enough to enable them, with
                  the assistance of party rings, to have themselves counted in at election-time, and
                  to devise new and dexterous schemes of dishonesty; but in other and rather more
                  desirable of the qualifications of law-makers they are deficient. They occupy the
                  most important place in republican governments without knowing what republicanism
                  means, and they create laws for the communities without having any knowledge of
                  the science of law or the slightest acquaintance with the needs and requirements
                  of the people for whom they act. The average American legislator is both ignorant
                  and dishonest. Judge Pitman is ignorant, but he is honest; and as his election
                  would secure at least a very important half of a fitting legislator, I supported
                  him.</p>
               <p>My other neighbor, Cooley, was the chairman of the committee to whose care was
                  consigned the management of the campaign in which Judge Pitman played so prominent
                  a part; and Cooley conducted the business with even an excess of enthusiasm. Just
                  after the nomination of Pitman, Cooley called on him to say that a number of his
                  friends had declared their intention to offer him a serenade. Cooley informed the
                  judge that some refreshment must be given to the serenaders, but he, as the
                  chairman of the committee, would attend to that; the judge need not make
                  preparations of any kind. Accordingly, on the following evening a brass band,
                  accompanied by a score or two politicians, entered Pitman's man's front yard, and
                  for half an hour there was some very good music. Then the judge came out upon the
                  porch and made a better speech than I had expected to hear from him. He concluded
                  by asking the company to enter his house. Cooley was there with a wagon-load of
                  meat and drink, including, of course, a large quantity of rum of the most
                  impressive kinds. The judge, with the fear of the temperance society present in
                  his mind, protested against the liquor; but Cooley demonstrated to him that he
                  would be defeated and the party ruined if it was excluded, and so Pitman
                  reluctantly permitted it to be placed upon his table. Besides, as Cooley had been
                  so very liberal in undertaking to make this provision at his own cost, the judge
                  disliked to hurt his feelings by refusing to permit the use of that which Cooley
                  evidently considered the most important portion of it.</p>
               <p>The guests remained at the banquet until four o'clock the next morning, the
                  politicians meanwhile making speeches <figure/> and the band playing occasionally
                  in the dining-room in a most uproarious manner. We could hear the noise at my
                  house during the night, and sleep was possible only with the windows closed.</p>
               <p>At four o'clock my door-bell rang violently; and upon descending to ascertain the
                  cause of a visit at such an unseemly hour, I encountered Judge Pitman. He was
                  nearly frantic with indignation.</p>
               <p>"Adeler," he said, "them fellers is a-carryin' on scand'lus over yer at my house.
                  They're all drunk as owls; an' when I want 'em to go home, they laugh an' swear
                  an' cheer<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6059-00000184"/> an' smash the furniture an'
                  bu'st things generally. Mrs. Pitman's 'bout skeered to death. Can't you come over
                  an' help me clear them out?"</p>
               <p>"Why don't you call a couple of policemen? You hunt up two or three officers while
                  I dress myself, and we will see if we can't adjourn the meeting."</p>
               <p>By the time I was ready Pitman arrived with one policeman, and we proceeded to his
                  house. As we entered, the leader of the band was sitting upon the stairs,
                  infamously drunk, with the handle of his umbrella in his mouth, vainly endeavoring
                  to play a tune by fumbling his fingers among the ribs. Mr. Cooley was in a corner
                  of the parlor supporting himself by the wall while he endeavored to discuss the
                  <figure/> question of the tariff with Pitman's plaster bust of Daniel Webster, and
                  to correct Daniel's view of the local option law. Another politician was sitting
                  upon the carpet crying because, so he informed us, his wife's maiden name was
                  McCarthy Carthy, and just as the policeman was removing him a combat occurred
                  between the bass drummer and a man from Wilmington, during which the drummer was
                  hurled against the pier glass and then dragged out to bleed upon the rug. The
                  house was finally cleared of the company just as the church clock struck six, and
                  then Pitman went to bed with sentiments of complete disgust for politics and
                  politicians.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>But he remained a candidate of the party. He had promised to run, and he
                  determined to go through with the business.</p>
               <p>"That serenade was rough enough without anythin' wuss," said the judge to me a day
                  or two afterward; "but I did think Cooley was a-rubbin' it in 'most too hard when
                  he come over yesterday with a bill for the refreshments which he wanted me to
                  pay."</p>
               <p>"Why, I thought he agreed to supply the supper?"</p>
               <p>"So he did. But now he says that of course he was only actin' for me. 'The
                  candidate,' he says, 'always foots all the bills.' I'll foot this one, an' then
                  I'll foot Cooley if he ever brings them ruffians to my house agin. I expect
                  nothin' else but the temperance society will shut down on me for that riot we had
                  t'other night."</p>
               <p>"I hope not; but I should think that affair would have made you sorry that you
                  ever undertook this business."</p>
               <p>"So it does," replied the judge, "but I never back down when I go into a thing.
                  I'm goin' to run for the Legislatur'; and if I'm elected, I'm goin' to serve my
                  country honestly until my time's up. Then I'm comin' home, an' goin' to stay home.
                  And what's more, I'll stir up that Legislatur' while I'm in it. You mind me!"</p>
               <p>The result of the contest was that the judge was elected by a large majority, and
                  he will sit in the next Assembly.</p>
               <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6059-00000185"/>
               <p>I played a peculiar part in the campaign; and although the narrative of my
                  experience as an amateur politician is not a particularly grateful one to me, it
                  might as well be given, if for no other reason, because it will serve to warn
                  others against the fate that befel me.</p>
               <p>I had for some time entertained a strong conviction that nature designed me for an
                  orator. I was assured that I possessed the gift of eloquence which enables great
                  speakers to sway the passions of the multitude, and I felt that I needed but the
                  opportunity to reveal this fact to the world. Accordingly, at the beginning of the
                  political campaign of which I speak I sent my name to one of the executive
                  committees of the State, in Wilmington, with the request that it might be written
                  down with the names of the speakers who could be called upon whenever important
                  meetings were held. I waited impatiently all through the campaign for a summons to
                  appear and electrify the people. It did not come, and I was almost in despair. But
                  on the day before the election I received from the chairman a brief note, saying
                  that I had been announced to speak at Dover that evening before a great mass
                  meeting, and requesting me to take the early afternoon train, so that I might
                  report to the local chairman in Dover before nightfall. The pleasure with which
                  this summons was received was in some measure marred by the fact that I had not a
                  speech ready, and the time was so short that elaborate preparation was impossible.
                  But I determined to throw into some sort of shape the ideas and arguments which
                  would readily occur to the mind of a man familiar with the ordinary political
                  questions of the day and with the merits of the candidates, and to trust to the
                  inspiration of the occasion for the power to present them forcibly and
                  eloquently.</p>
               <p>Of course it was plain that anything like an attempt at gorgeousness in such a
                  speech would be foolish, so I concluded cluded to speak plainly and directly to
                  the point, and to enliven my argument with some amusing campaign stories. In order
                  to fix my points firmly in my mind and to ensure their presentation in their
                  proper order, they were numbered and committed to memory, each argument and its
                  accompanying anecdote being associated with a particular arithmetical figure. The
                  synopsis, if it may be called by that name, presented an appearance something like
                  the following, excepting that it contained a specification of the points of the
                  speech which need not be reproduced here.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>THE SPEECH.</head>
                  <item>1. Exordium, concluding with Scott's famous lines, "Breathes there a man
                     with soul so dead," etc.</item>
                  <item>2. Arguments, introducing a narrative of the facts in the case of Hotchkiss,
                     who was locked out upon the roof of his house all night. (See particulars
                     farther on.) The design of the story is to give a striking picture of the
                     manner in which the opposition party will be left out in the cold by the
                     election. (Make this strong, and pause for cheers.)</item>
                  <item>3. Arguments, followed by the story of the Kickapoo Indian who saw a
                     locomotive approaching upon the plains, and thinking it was a superior breed of
                     buffalo, determined to capture it, so that he could take the first prize at the
                     Kickapoo agricultural fair. He tied his lasso to his waist and threw the other
                     end over <figure/> the smoke-stack. The locomotive did not stop; but when the
                     engineer arrived at the next station, he went out and cut the string by which a
                     small bit of copper-colored meat was tied to his smoke-stack. This is to
                     illustrate the folly of the attempt of conservatism to check the onward career
                     of pure and enlightened liberalism toward perfect civilization, etc.,
                     etc.</item>

                  <item>
                     <p>4. Arguments, and then the anecdote of that Dutchman in Berks county, Pa.,
                        who on the 10th of October, 1866, was observed to go out into his yard and
                        raise the American flag; then he got his gun and fired a salute seventeen or
                        eighteen times, after which he consumed six packs of fire-crackers and gave
                        three cheers for the Union. He enjoyed himself in this manner nearly all
                        day, while his neighbors gathered around outside and placed their elbows
                        upon the fence, watching him and wondering what on earth he meant. A peddler
                        who came along stopped and had an interview with him. To his surprise, he
                        found that the German agriculturist was celebrating the Fourth of July,
                        1859. He did not know that it was any later in the century, for he had been
                        keeping his time on a notched stick; and having been sick a great deal, he
                        had gotten the thing in a dreadful tangle. When he learned that he was seven
                        Fourths in arrears, he was depressed; but he sent out and bought a box of
                        fire-crackers and a barrel of gunpowder, and spent a week catching up.</p>

                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>(Tell<figure/> this vivaciously, and make the point that none but a member
                        of the other party could forget the glorious anniversary of our country's
                        birth, and say that the whole party will have to do up a lot of back
                        patriotism some day, if it desires to catch up with the people whose
                        devotion to the country is encouraged and kept active by our side.)</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. Arguments, supplemented with the narrative of a confiding man who had
                     such child-like faith in a patent fire-extinguisher which he had purchased that
                     he set fire to his house merely to have the fun of putting it out. The
                     <figure/> fire burned furiously, but the extinguisher gave only two or three
                     imbecile squirts and then collapsed, and in two hours his residence was in
                     ashes. Go on to say that our enemies have applied the torch of anarchy to the
                     edifice of this government, but that there is an extinguisher which will not
                     only <emph>not</emph> collapse, but will subdue the flames and quench the
                     incendiary organization, and that extinguisher is our party. (Allow time for
                     applause here.)</item>
                  <item>6. Arguments, introducing the story of the Sussex county farmer who was
                     discouraged because his wife was perfidious. Before he was married she vowed
                     over and over again that she could chop four cords of wood a day, but after the
                     ceremony the <figure/> farmer found he was deceived. The treacherous woman
                     could not chop more than two cords and a half, and so the dream of the husband
                     was dissipated, and he demanded a divorce as the only balm for the wounds which
                     lacerated his heart. Let this serve to illustrate the point that our political
                     enemies have deceived us with promises to reduce the debt, to institute
                     reforms, etc., etc., none of which they have kept, and now we must have<pb
                        n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6059-00000187"/> the government separated from them
                     by such a divorce as will be decreed to-morrow, etc., etc.</item>
                  <item>7. Peroration, working in if possible the story of Commodore Scudder's dog,
                     which, while out with its master one day, pointed at some partridges. The
                     commodore was about to fire, but he suddenly received orders to go off on a
                     three years' cruise, so he dropped his gun, left the dog standing there and
                     went right to sea. When he returned, three years later, he went back to the
                     field, and there was his gun, there was the skeleton of the dog still standing
                     and pointing just as he had left it, and a little farther on were the skeletons
                     of the partridges. Show how our adversaries in their relations to the negro
                     question resemble that dog. We came away years ago and left them pointing at
                     the negro question, and we come back now to find that they are at it yet. Work
                     this in carefully, and conclude in such a manner as to excite frantic
                     applause.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It was not much of a speech, I know. Some of the arguments were weak, and several
                  of the stories failed to fit into their places comfortably. But mass meetings do
                  not criticise closely, and I was persuaded I should make a good impression,
                  provoking laughter and perhaps exciting enthusiasm. The only time that could be
                  procured for study of the speech was that consumed by the journey. So when the
                  train started I took my notes from my pocket and learned them by heart. Then came
                  the task of enlarging them, in my mind, into a speech. This was accomplished
                  satisfactorily. I suppose that speech was repeated at least ten times between New
                  Castle and Dover until at last I had it at my tongue's end. In the cars the seat
                  next to mine was occupied by a colored gentleman, who seemed to be a little
                  nervous when he perceived that I was muttering something continually; and he was
                  actually alarmed once or twice when in exciting passages I would forget myself and
                  gesticulate violently in his direction. Finally, when I came to the conclusion and
                  was repeating to myself the exhortation, "Strike for your altars and your fires,"
                  etc., etc., I emphasized the language by striking fiercely at the floor with the
                  ferule of my umbrella. It hit something soft. I think it was the corn of my
                  colored friend, for he leaped up hurriedly, and ejaculating "Gosh!" went up and
                  stood by the water-cooler during the rest of the journey, looking at me as if he
                  thought it was dangerous for such a maniac to be at large.</p>
               <p>When the train arrived at Dover, I was gratified to find the chairman of the local
                  committee and eighteen of his fellow-citizens waiting for me with carriages and a
                  brass band. As I stepped from the car the band played "See, the Conquering Hero
                  comes!" I marched into the waiting-room of the dépôt, followed by the committee
                  and the band. The chairman and his friends formed a semi-circle and stared at
                  <figure/> me. I learned afterward that they had received information from
                  Wilmington that I was one of the most remarkable orators in the State. It was
                  impossible not to perceive that they regarded me already with enthusiastic
                  admiration; and my heart sank a little as I reflected upon the possibility of
                  failure.</p>
               <p>Then the music ceased, and the chairman proposed "three cheers for our eloquent
                  visitor." The devoted beings around him cheered lustily. The chairman thereupon
                  came forward and welcomed me in the following terms:</p>
               <p>"My dear sir, it is with unfeigned satisfaction that I have—may I say the exalted
                  honor?—of welcoming you to the city of Dover. You come, sir, at a moment when the
                  heart of every true patriot beats high with hope for a glorious<pb n="374-375"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000188"/> triumph over the enemies of our cherished
                  institutions; you come, sir, at a time when our great party, the true
                  representative of American principles and the guardian of our liberties, bends to
                  grapple with the deadly foe of our country; at a time, sir, when the American
                  eagle—proud bird, which soars, as we would, to the sun—screams forth its defiance
                  of treason, and when the banner of the free, the glorious emblem of our
                  nationality, waves us onward to victory; you come, sir, to animate with your
                  eloquence the hearts of our fellow-citizens; to inspire with your glowing language
                  the souls of those who shrink from performing their duty in this contest; to
                  depict in words of burning, scathing power the shame, the disgrace, the
                  irretrievable ruin, which will befall our land if its enemies are victorious, and
                  to hold up those enemies, as you well know how, to the scorn and contempt of all
                  honest men. We give you a hearty welcome, then, and assure you that Dover will
                  respond nobly to your appeal, giving tomorrow such a vote for justice, truth and
                  the rights of man that the conservative wolf will shrink back in dismay to his
                  lair. Welcome, sir, thrice welcome, to our city!"</p>
               <p>I stood looking at this man throughout his speech with a conviction, constantly
                  growing stronger, that I should be obliged to reply to him at some length. The
                  contemplation of such a thing, I need hardly say, filled me with horror. I had
                  never made a speech of the kind that would be required in my life, and I felt
                  positively certain that I could not accomplish the task now. I had half a mind to
                  hurl at the heads of this chairman and his attendant fiends the entire oration
                  prepared for the evening; but that seemed so dreadfully inappropriate that the
                  idea was abandoned. And besides, what would I say at the mass meeting? The comfort
                  of the situation was not, by any means, improved by the fact that these persons
                  entertained the belief that I was an experienced speaker who would probably throw
                  off a dozen brilliant things in as many sentences. It was exceedingly
                  embarrassing; and when the chairman concluded his remarks, the cold perspiration
                  stood upon my forehead and my knees trembled.</p>
               <p>Happily, the leader of the band desired to make himself conspicuous, so he
                  embraced the opportunity afforded by the pause to give us some startling
                  variations of "The Star-Spangled Banner."</p>
               <p>As we stood there listening to the music, I observed that the energetic gentleman
                  who played upon the drum and cymbals was looking at me with what seemed to be a
                  scornful smile. He had a peculiarly cold eye, and as he fixed it upon me I felt
                  that the frigid optic pierced through and through my assumption of ease and
                  perceived what a miserable sham it was for me to stand there pretending to be an
                  orator. I quailed before that eye. Its glance humiliated me; and I did not feel
                  more pleasantly when, as the band dashed into the final quavers which bring up
                  suggestions of "the land of the free and the home of the brave," I saw the scorn
                  which erst flashed from that eye change to a look of wild exultation. The cymbal
                  man knew that my hour had come. He gave a final clash with his brasses and paused.
                  I had to begin. Bowing to the chairman, I said,</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"Mr. Chairman and fellow-citizens, there are times—times—there are times,
                  fellow-citizens, when—times when—when the heart—there are times, I say, Mr.
                  Chairman and fellow-citizens, when the heart—the heart of—of—" It wouldn't do. I
                  stuck fast, and could not get out another word.</p>
               <p>The cold-eyed man seemed ready to play triumphal strains upon his drum and to
                  smash out a pæan upon his cymbals. In the frenzy and desperation of the moment, I
                  determined to take the poetry from my exordium and to jam it into the<pb
                     n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6059-00000189"/> present speech, whether it was
                  appropriate or not. I began again:</p>
               <p>"There are times, I say, fellow-citizens and Mr. Chairman, when the heart inquires
                  if there breathes a man with soul so dead, who never to himself hath said, 'This
                  is my own, my native land'—whose heart has ne'er within him burned as home his
                  footsteps he hath turned from wanderings on a foreign shore? If such there
                  breathe, go, mark him well!" (Here I pointed to the street, and one of the
                  committee, who seemed not to comprehend the thing exactly, rushed to the window
                  and looked out, as if he intended to call a policeman to arrest the wretch
                  referred to.) "For him no minstrel raptures swell." (Here the leader of the band
                  bowed, as if he had a vague idea that this was a compliment ingeniously worked
                  into the speech for his benefit; but the cold-eyed man had a sneering smile which
                  seemed to say, "It won't do, my man, it won't do. I can't be bought off in that
                  manner.") "High though his titles, proud his name, boundless his wealth as wish
                  can claim; despite these titles, power and pelf, the wretch, concentred all in
                  self, living, shall forfeit fair renown, and doubly dying shall go down to the
                  vile dust from whence he sprung, unwept, unhonored and unsung."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I stopped. There was embarrassing silence for a moment, as if everybody thought I
                  had something more to say. But I put on my hat and shouldered my umbrella to
                  assure them that the affair was ended. Then it began to be apparent that the
                  company failed to grasp the purpose of my remarks. One man evidently thought I was
                  complaining of something that happened to me while I was upon the train, for he
                  took me aside and asked me in a confidential whisper if it wouldn't be better for
                  him to see the conductor about it.</p>
               <p>Another man inquired if the governor was the man referred to.</p>
               <p>I said, "No; the remarks were of a poetical nature; they were quoted."</p>
               <p>The man seemed surprised, and asked where I got them from.</p>
               <p>"From <emph>Marmion.</emph>"</p>
               <p>He considered a moment, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Don't know him. Philadelphia man, I reckon?"</p>
               <p>The occasion was too sad for words. I took the chairman's arm and we marched out
                  to the carriages, the cold-eyed man thumping his drum as if his feeling of
                  animosity for me would kill him if it did not find vigorous expression of that
                  kind.</p>
               <p>We entered the carriages and formed a procession, the band, on foot, leading the
                  way and playing "Hail to the Chief." I rode with the chairman, who insisted that I
                  should carry the American flag in my hand. As we passed up the street the crowd
                  cheered us vehemently several times, and the chairman said he thought it would be
                  better if I would rise occasionally and bow in response. I did so, remarking, at
                  the last, that it was rather singular such a reception should be given to a
                  complete stranger.</p>
               <p>The chairman said he had been thinking of that, and it had occurred to him just at
                  that moment that perhaps the populace had mistaken the character of the
                  parade.</p>
               <p>"You see," said he, "there is a circus in town, and I am a little bit afraid the
                  people are impressed with the idea that this is the showman's procession, and that
                  you are the<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6059-00000190"/> Aërial King. That monarch
                  is a man of about your build, and he wears whiskers."</p>
               <p>The Aërial King achieved distinction and a throne by leaping into the air and
                  turning two backward somersaults before alighting, and also by standing poised
                  upon one toe on a wire while he balanced a pole upon his nose. I had no desire to
                  share the sceptre with that man, or to rob him of any of his renown, so I furled
                  the flag of my beloved country, pulled my hat over my eyes and refused to bow
                  again.</p>
               <p>It was supper-time when we reached the hotel, and as soon as we entered, the
                  chairman invited us into one of the parlors, where an elaborate repast had been
                  prepared for the whole party. We went into the room, keeping step with a march
                  played by the band, which was placed in the corner. When supper was over, it was
                  with dismay that I saw the irrepressible chairman rise and propose a toast, to
                  which he called upon one of the company to respond. I knew my turn would come
                  presently, and there seemed to be no choice between the sacrifice of my great
                  speech to this paltry occasion and utter ruin and disgrace. It appeared to me that
                  the chairman must have guessed that I had but one speech, and that he had
                  determined to force me to deliver it prematurely, so that I might be overwhelmed
                  with mortification at the mass meeting. But I made up my mind to cling desperately
                  to the solitary oration, no matter how much pressure was brought to bear to
                  deprive me of it. So I resolved that if the chairman called upon me I would tell
                  my number two story, giving the arguments, and omitting all of it from my speech
                  in the evening.</p>
               <p>He did call. When two or three men had spoken, the chairman offered the toast,
                  "The orator of the evening," and it was received with applause. The chairman said:
                  "It is with peculiar pleasure that I offer this sentiment. It gives to my eloquent
                  young friend an opportunity which could not be obtained amid the embarrassments of
                  the dépôt to offer, without restraint, such an exhibition of his powers as would
                  prove to the company that the art which enabled Webster and Clay to win the
                  admiration of an entranced world was not lost—that it found a master interpreter
                  in the gentleman who sits before me."</p>
               <p>This was severe. The cold-eyed child of the Muses sitting with the band looked as
                  if he felt really and thoroughly glad in the inmost recesses of his soul for the
                  first time in his life.</p>
               <p>I rose, and said: "Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I am too much fatigued to make a
                  speech, and I wish to save my voice for to-night; so I will tell you a story of a
                  man I used to know whose name was Hotchkiss. He lived up at New Castle, and one
                  night he thought he would have a little innocent fun scaring his wife by dropping
                  a loose brick or two down the chimney into the fireplace in her room. So he
                  slipped softly out of bed; and dressed in his night-shirt, he stole up stairs and
                  crept out upon the roof. Mr. Hotchkiss dropped nineteen bricks down that chimney,
                  Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, each one with an emphatic slam, but his wife didn't
                  scream once."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Everybody seemed to think this was the end of the story; so there was a roar of
                  laughter, although I had not reached the humorous part or the real point of the
                  anecdote, which<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6059-00000191"/> describes how Hotchkiss
                  gave it up and tried to go down stairs, but was surprised to find that Mrs.
                  Hotchkiss, who had been watching all the time, had retreated, fastening the
                  trap-door, so that he spent the next four hours upon the comb of the roof with his
                  trailing garments of the night fluttering in the evening breeze. But they all
                  laughed and began to talk; and the leader of the band, considering that his turn
                  must have come, struck out into "Hail Columbia," while the man with the cymbals
                  seemed animated with fiendish glee.</p>
               <p>I tried to explain to the chairman that it was all wrong, that the affair was
                  terribly mixed.</p>
               <p>He said he thought himself that it seemed so somehow, and he offered to explain
                  the matter to the company and to give me a chance to tell the story over again
                  properly.</p>
               <p>I intimated, gloomily, that if he undertook such a thing I would blow out his
                  brains with the very first horse-pistol I could lay my hands upon.</p>
               <p>He said perhaps, then, it would be better not to do</p>
               <p>The proceedings at the mass meeting were to begin at eight o'clock. At half-past
                  seven I went to the telegraph office, and sent the following despatch to the
                  Wilmington papers, fearing the office might be closed when the meeting
                  adjourned:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"DOVER, —— —, 18—: A tremendous mass meeting was held here to-night. The utmost
                     enthusiasm was displayed by the crowd. Effective speeches were made by several
                     prominent gentlemen, among them the eloquent young orator Mr. Max Adeler, whose
                     spirited remarks, interspersed with sparkling anecdote, provoked uproarious
                     applause. Dover is good for five hundred majority, and perhaps a thousand."</p>
               </q>
               <p>At eight o'clock a very large crowd really did assemble in front of the porch of
                  one of the hotels. The speakers were placed upon the balcony, which was but a few
                  feet above the pavement, and there was also a number of persons connected with the
                  various political clubs of the town. I felt somewhat nervous; but I was tolerably
                  certain I could speak my piece acceptably, even with the poetry torn out of the
                  introduction and the number two story sacrificed. I took a seat upon the porch and
                  waited while the band played a spirited air or two. It grieved me to perceive that
                  the band stood directly in front of us upon the pavement, the cold-eyed drummer
                  occupying a favorable position for staring at me.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The chairman began with a short speech in which he went over almost precisely the
                  ground covered by my introduction; and as that portion of my oration was already
                  reduced to a fragment by the use of the verses, I quietly resolved to begin, when
                  my turn came, with point number two.</p>
               <p>The chairman introduced to the crowd Mr. Keyser, who was received with cheers. He
                  was a ready speaker, and he began, to my deep regret, by telling in capital style
                  my story number three, after which he used up some of my number six arguments, and
                  concluded with the remark that it was not his purpose to occupy the attention of
                  the meeting for any length of time, because the executive committee in Wilmington
                  had sent an eloquent orator who was now upon the platform and would present the
                  cause of the party in a manner which he could not hope to approach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keyser then sat down, and Mr. Schwartz was introduced. Mr. Schwartz observed
                  that it was hardly worth while for him to attempt to make anything like a speech,
                  because the gentleman from New Castle had come down on<pb n="382-383"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000192"/> purpose to discuss the issues of the campaign, and
                  the audience, of course, was anxious to hear him. Mr. Schwartz would only tell a
                  little story which seemed to illustrate a point he wished to make, and he
                  thereupon related my anecdote number seven, making it appear that he was the bosom
                  friend of Commodore Scudder and an acquaintance of the man who made the gun. The
                  point illustrated I was shocked to find was almost precisely that which I had
                  attached to my story number seven. The situation began to have a serious
                  appearance. Here, at one fell swoop, two of my best stories and three of my sets
                  of arguments were swept off into utter uselessness.</p>
               <p>When Schwartz withdrew, a man named Krumbauer was brought forward. Krumbauer was a
                  German, and the chairman announced that he would speak in that language for the
                  benefit of those persons in the audience to whom the tongue was pleasantly
                  familiar. Krumbauer went ahead, and the crowd received his remarks with roars of
                  laughter. After one particularly exuberant outburst of merriment, I asked the man
                  who sat next to me, and who seemed deeply interested in the story,</p>
               <p>"What was that little joke of Krumbauer's? It must have been first rate."</p>
               <p>"So it was," he said. "It was about a Dutchman up in Berks county, Penna., who got
                  mixed up in his dates."</p>
               <p>"What dates?" I gasped, in awful apprehension.</p>
               <p>"Why, his Fourths of July, you know. Got seven or eight years in arrears and tried
                  to make them all up at once. Good, wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Good? I should think so; ha! ha! My very best story, as I'm a sinner!"</p>
               <p>It was awfully bad. I could have strangled Krumbauer and then chopped him into
                  bits. The ground seemed slipping away beneath me; there was the merest skeleton of
                  a speech left. But I determined to take that and do my best, trusting to luck for
                  a happy result.</p>
               <p>But my turn had not yet come. Mr. Wilson was dragged out next, and I thought I
                  perceived a demoniac smile steal over the countenance of the cymbal player as
                  Wilson said he was too hoarse to say much; he would leave the heavy work for the
                  brilliant young orator who was here from New Castle. He would skim rapidly over
                  the ground and then retire. He did. Wilson rapidly skimmed all the cream off of my
                  arguments numbers two, five and six, and wound up by offering the whole of my
                  number four argument. My hair fairly stood on end when Wilson bowed and left the
                  stand. What on earth was I to do now? Not an argument left to stand upon; all my
                  anecdotes gone but two, and my mind in such a condition of frenzied bewilderment
                  that it seemed as if there was not another available argument or suggestion or
                  hint or anecdote remaining in the entire universe. In an agony of despair, I
                  turned to the man next to me and asked him if I would have to follow Wilson.</p>
               <p>He said it was his turn now.</p>
               <p>"And what are you going to say?" I demanded, suspiciously.</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing," he replied—"nothing at all. I want to leave room for you. I'll just
                  tell a little story or so, to amuse them, and then sit down."</p>
               <p>"What story, for instance?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing, nothing; only a little yarn I happen to remember about a farmer who
                  married a woman who said she could cut four cords of wood, when she couldn't."</p>
               <p>My worst fears were realized. I turned to the man next to me, and said, with
                  suppressed emotion,</p>
               <p>"May I ask your name, my friend?"</p>
               <p>He said his name was Gumbs.</p>
               <p>"May I inquire what your Christian name is?"</p>
               <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6059-00000193"/>
               <p>He said it was William Henry.</p>
               <p>"Well, William Henry Gumbs," I exclaimed, "gaze at me! Do I look like a man who
                  would slay a human being in cold blood?"</p>
               <p>"Hm-m-m, n-no; you don't," he replied, with an air of critical consideration.</p>
               <p>"But I AM!" said I, fiercely—"I AM; and I tell you now that if you undertake to
                  relate that anecdote about the farmer's wife I will blow you into eternity without
                  a moment's warning; I will, by George!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Gumbs instantly jumped up, placed his hand on the railing of the porch, and
                  got over suddenly into the crowd. He stood there pointing me out to the
                  bystanders, and doubtless advancing the theory that I was an original kind of a
                  lunatic, who might be expected to have at any moment a fit which would be
                  interesting when studied from a distance.</p>
               <p>The chairman looked around, intending to call upon my friend Mr. Gumbs; but not
                  perceiving him, he came to me and said:</p>
               <p>"Now is your chance, sir; splendid opportunity; crowd worked up to just the proper
                  pitch. We have paved the way for you; go in and do your best."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes; but hold on for a few moments, will you? I can't speak now; the fact is I
                  am not quite ready. Run out some other man."</p>
               <p>"Haven't got another man. Kept you for the last purposely, and the crowd is
                  waiting. Come ahead and pitch in, and give it to 'em hot and heavy."</p>
               <p>It was very easy for him to say "give it to them," but I had nothing to give.
                  Beautifully they paved the way for me! Nicely they had worked up the crowd to the
                  proper pitch! Here I was in a condition of frantic despair, with a crowd of one
                  thousand people expecting a brilliant oration from me who had not a thing in my
                  mind but a beggarly story about a fire-extinguisher and a worse one about a
                  farmer's wife. I groaned in spirit and wished I had been born far away in some
                  distant clime among savages who knew not of mass meetings, and whose language
                  contained such a small number of words that speech-making was impossible.</p>
               <p>But the chairman was determined. He seized me by the arm and fairly dragged me to
                  the front. He introduced me to the crowd in flattering, and I may say outrageously
                  ridiculous, terms, and then whispering in my ear, "Hit 'em hard, old fellow, hit
                  'em hard," he sat down.</p>
               <p>The crowd received me with three hearty cheers. As I heard them I began to feel
                  dizzy. The audience seemed to swim around and to increase tenfold in size. By a
                  resolute effort I recovered my self-possession partially, and determined to begin.
                  I could not think of anything but the two stories, and I resolved to tell them as
                  well as I could. I said,</p>
               <p>"Fellow-citizens: It is so late now that I will not attempt to make a speech to
                  you." (Cries of "Yes!" "Go ahead!" "Never mind the time!" etc., etc.) Elevating my
                  voice, I repeated: "I say it is so late now that I can't make a speech as I
                  intended on account of its being so late that the speech which I intended to make
                  would keep you here too late if I made it as I intended to. So I will tell you a
                  story about a man who bought a patent fire-extinguisher which was warranted to
                  split four cords of wood a day; so he set fire to his house to try her, and—No, it
                  was his wife who was warranted to split four cords of wood—I got it wrong; and
                  when the flames obtained full headway, he found she could only split two cords and
                  a half, and it made him—What I mean is that the farmer, when he bought the
                  exting—courted her, that is, she said she could set fire to the house, and when he
                  tried her, she collapsed the first time—the extinguisher<pb n="386-387"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000194"/> tinguisher did, and he wanted a divorce because his
                  house—Oh, hang it, fellow-citizens, you understand that this man, or farmer,
                  rather, bought a—I should say courted a—that is, a fire-ex—" (Desperately.)
                  "Fellow-citizens! IF ANY MAN SHOOTS THE AMERICAN FLAG, PULL HIM DOWN UPON THE
                  SPOT; BUT AS FOR ME, GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!"</p>
               <p>As I shouted this out at the top of my voice, in an ecstasy of confusion, a wild,
                  tumultuous yell of laughter came up from the crowd. I paused for a second beneath
                  the spell of that cold eye in the band, and then, dashing through the throng at
                  the back of the porch, I rushed down the street to the dépôt, with the shouts of
                  the crowd and the uproarious music of the band ringing in my ears. I got upon a
                  freight train, gave the engineer five dollars to take me along on the locomotive,
                  and spent the night riding to New Castle.</p>

               <p>YESTERDAY was the day of the wedding.</p>
               <p>I suppose no one can hope to describe accurately the sensation that is created by
                  such an event in a little community like ours. It has supplied the ladies of the
                  village with material for discussion for several weeks past, and the extraordinary
                  interest manifested in it has constantly grown stronger until it culminated in a
                  blaze of excitement which made calmness upon the part of any New Castilian upon
                  the great day a wholly impossible condition. My own wife has introduced the
                  subject in her conversation with me at every available opportunity; and when I
                  have grown weary of hearing about the preparations for the wedding, about the
                  purchases made by the Magruders for Bessie, about the presents given to the bride

                  dull a listener, and seizing her bonnet and shawl, has darted off to visit Mrs.
                  Jones or Mrs. Hopkins, and has found them eager to participate in conversation
                  upon these subjects. During the past month this sympathetic woman has called at
                  Magruder's at least three times a day to ascertain the latest facts respecting the
                  situation, and to give advice and assistance to the busy workers who have been
                  preparing the multitude of articles which a girl must have before she is married.
                  Every woman in the village was familiar, long ago, with the minutest details of
                  the arrangements, and all of them were so deeply absorbed in the preparations and
                  in contemplation of the approaching catastrophe that they cared for nothing else.
                  If there had been revolutions, if thrones had tottered to their fall, if
                  hurricanes had swept over the land and the nations had been stricken by the
                  scourge, I verily believe that these devoted women of New Castle would have
                  regarded these calamities with steadfast composure, and would have excluded them
                  from a place in the social debates wherein the wedding of Bessie Magruder was the
                  one great subject of discussion.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more intense in nature than the interest felt by a woman in the
                  marriage of another woman. The fanatic fury of a Hindoo devotee is mere icy
                  indifference in comparison to it.</p>
               <p>It was entertaining to watch Bob Parker upon the evening before the wedding and
                  upon the morning of the great day itself. He had everything ready a week before
                  the time, and upon the last night of his bachelor life he had nothing to do but to
                  sit at home with us and think. And so, while I read my book and while Mrs. Adeler
                  finished the bonnet that she had made for the occasion from old material (the
                  dexterous economy of that woman, by the way, is simply phenomenal), Bob fidgeted
                  about. He pretended to read the paper; he threw himself upon the lounge and
                  counterfeited sleep; he darted suddenly up stairs to see if he had put a
                  sufficient number of collars in his trunk; he darted down <figure/> again and
                  tried on his new hat for the fiftieth time; he stood by the fire and expressed his
                  fear, often repeated during the day, that there would be rain on the morrow; he
                  tried to wind up his watch four times, and he examined his pocket-book over and
                  over again to ascertain if the ring was safe. At a ridiculously early hour he said
                  he was tired and must go to bed; but when I ascended the stairs about midnight, I
                  could hear him still moving about. He was nervous, excited and anxious.</p>
               <p>Before daylight dawned Bob was out of bed and down stairs smoking and guessing at
                  the weather. When we descended, he was in extreme agitation lest the man should
                  not come with the bouquets. When the flowers did arrive, they looked so much like
                  business that he immediately flew up to his room and put on his wedding suit.</p>
               <p>Then we had to wait nearly two hours for the carriages, and Bob was harassed by
                  doubts as to the correctness of the appearance of his neck-tie. Three times Mrs.
                  Adeler applied thread and needle to that article of adornment, and at<pb
                     n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6059-00000196"/> last Bob threw it away and assumed
                  another. He seemed to have a strong conviction that the eyes of the entire
                  assembly would be concentrated upon that white tie. Then he put on his gloves and
                  sat, flushed and uncomfortable in his new clothing, waiting for the moment of his
                  departure. Presently he discovered that he had lost one of his gold shirt buttons;
                  and after a very long and very warm search for it, he thought he felt it in his
                  boot. I procured a boot-jack for him; and when the button was found, he had to
                  remove his gloves again in order to pull his boot on. He was beginning to be
                  acutely miserable when, at last, the carriages arrived. Then Mrs. Adeler came
                  down; and when I had buttoned her gloves with a hair-pin and criticised the
                  appearance of her dress, we went out to the street and drove away.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>When we reached Magruder's, the doorway was surrounded by quite a throng of
                  persons. The excitement had reached even the lower classes, and a crowd composed
                  of slatternly women with babies in their arms, of truant servant-girls, of
                  <figure/> unclean children, of idle men and noisy boys, stood upon the pavement
                  waiting for the bride to come out. As we descended from the carriages, Bob was the
                  chief object of interest, and while the women eyed him with admiration the boys
                  made very unpleasant remarks concerning his clothing, particularly his
                  "claw-hammer coat." When we entered the house, Bob ascended to some mysterious
                  region above to wait for Bessie, while we examined the bridal gifts and conversed
                  versed with the paternal Magruder, who was plainly uncomfortable in his wedding
                  garments.</p>
               <p>Then the bride descended amid exclamations of admiration from the servants and
                  their friends, who were collected in a knot at the rear of the hall. She did look
                  very sweet and pretty, that little maiden, in her lovely white dress, with orange
                  blossoms in her dark hair, with a radiant light in her brown eyes and with a faint
                  glow warming her cheek. Bob Parker had good reason to feel proud as he led the
                  fair girl to the altar; and he was proud, despite his trepidation.</p>
               <p>And when our salutations were over, when the satins and silks were all arranged
                  and the bridesmaids and groomsmen were ready, we marched through the critical
                  assembly outside the door and drove swiftly to the church. At the gate we found,
                  awaiting the wedding party, another throng of spectators, among them that gloomy
                  undertaker, with his chin hooked upon the wall, and his mind still brooding over
                  his wrongs.</p>
               <p>Then we heard the organ playing the Coronation March, and as the bridal party
                  entered the church and swept up the aisle the Wedding March burst forth. There was
                  a fluttering and a turning of heads in the pews; then silence, and then the
                  ceremony began. Bob was pale as a ghost, and his replies could hardly be heard,
                  but Bessie spoke with perfect distinctness. It is strange that women on these
                  occasions should always be more composed than men.</p>
               <p>And when the solemn words were said, Bob kissed his wife gallantly, and then, as
                  the organ uttered Mendelssohn's lovely melody "I waited for the Lord," the two
                  turned about and in the aisle met hosts of friends eager to congratulate them. At
                  any other time Bob might have been mortified that he was a person of secondary
                  importance. It was the bride that the people looked at, and not the groom. But now
                  he was too happy and too ready to forget himself<pb n="392-393"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000197"/> He was too glad to have his wife greeted warmly to
                  think of any other thing. By the time the church porch was reached every woman
                  present had the details of Bessie's costume fixed indelibly in her mind, ready for
                  description and explanation to her friends; and while the bell in the steeple rang
                  out a merry peal, we returned to the Magruder mansion, where, in the company of
                  friends, we passed the few hours before the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Parker.</p>
               <p>Rev.Dr.Hopkins was there, beaming at the guests through his gold spectacles, and
                  making himself very comfortable with the oysters and terrapin and chicken salad.
                  He even had a smile for Colonel Bangs, who was discussing with Mr. Magruder the
                  probable effect upon the railway interests of the country of an article in the
                     <title>Argus</title> of that morning upon <figure/> "Our Grinding Monopolies."
                  It was interesting to listen to the colonel.</p>
               <p>"I tell you," said he, with vehemence, "the time has come for the overthrow of
                  these gigantic railroad corporations; the time has come for a free press to open
                  its batteries upon the monopolies which are trampling the rights of the people
                  beneath their feet. There will be a bitter fight, sir, mark me; it will be a
                  battle to the death. But the <title>Argus</title> enters the lists boldly and
                  without fear. The article of to-day un-sheaths the sword; it warns the railway
                  tyrants that the battle has begun."</p>
               <p>"I am sure it will alarm them," said Mr. Magruder. "And you, I suppose, are
                  willing to give up everything for the cause? How about your annual free pass to
                  Philadelphia?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, ah! as for that," exclaimed the colonel, "you perhaps observed that I
                  expressly excepted our own road and complimented its officers. A man must not go
                  to extremes in these matters, Magruder. And then there's the advertising, you
                  know! No, sir; we must proceed, as it were, cautiously at first. Precipitate
                  action might ruin everything."</p>
               <p>Dr. Tobias Jones also had overcome his professional animosity to Mrs. Magruder,
                  and he was not only present, but he was conversing pleasantly with that lady,
                  probably upon the subjects of bilious fever and aneurisms. Benjamin P. Gunn was
                  there, bustling around among the guests and paying especial attention to Bob. When
                  I saw Gunn in earnest conversation with the groom and caught the words, "in favor
                  of your wife, you know," I became aware of the fact that Benjamin was improving
                  the festive hour with an attempt to do a bit of business. Even Judge Pitman was
                  present, for Mr. Magruder liked the old man and was in a gracious mood upon that
                  day. I welcomed the judge heartily when, dressed in a swallow-tail coat of a
                  surprising pattern, he came up to me and said,</p>
               <p>"Splendid send-off for them young folks, ain't it? I tell<pb n="394-395"
                     xml:id="VAC6059-00000198"/> you, they didn't do things this way when me an'
                  Harriet consolidated! We lived down yer in Kent; an' when we were married by the
                  squire, I give him fifty cents an' then went out an' borrowed a waggin so's me an'
                  Harriet could take a little drive. We come up yer to New Cassel an' stayed two
                  days at the tavern, an' then drove back an' begun work agin, jes' 's if nothin'
                  oncommon had happened."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"It was not the custom then, I suppose, to make a display on such occasions?"</p>
               <p>"No, <emph>sir!</emph> People hadn't no money to git up sich fodderin' as this
                  yer. They had to go slower. Still," mused the judge, "it's all right—it's all
                  right. Gittin' married 's a big event; an' if you kin make a fuss over it, you
                  ought to. If my daughter ever tries it, I'll give her the best I kin buy. A
                  weddin' like this is nice all 'round, but the wimmen in partickler is amazin' fond
                  of sich things. If you'll excuse me, I believe I'll try another fried oyster."</p>
               <p>There was another exciting time when Bessie, at last, came down in her traveling
                  dress and stood with Bob ready to depart. While the cabman carried the trunks to
                  the carriage, Bessie said her farewells. There was a good-bye for mother, uttered
                  with tears in the eyes of both of them, a tender adieu to father, kisses for the
                  women and a shake of the hand for the men, and then they entered the carriage. We
                  flung an old shoe or two after them and waved our hands; and <figure/> Cooley's
                  boy gave them a parting salute with a stone that shivered the carriage window. We
                  watched them as they went down the street, and saw, now and then, a handkerchief
                  fluttered toward us; then they turned a corner and disappeared.</p>
               <p>It was a little lonely in the cottage upon that evening with Bob no longer a
                  member of the family. We shall miss him, with his sprightliness and fun; and we
                  shall half incline to regret that the little drama we have watched so long with
                  eager interest is ended, even though the prince, after all his suffering, has
                  found the princess and wedded her, and though at last they have gone "across the
                  hills and far away" beyond "the utmost purple rim of that new world, which is the
                  old."</p>
               <p>We sat in the old room in silence for a while, both looking at the fire and both
                  thinking, not so much of the events of the day as of the promise of the future for
                  those two voyagers into the golden regions of delight. Then Mrs. Adeler said, with
                  half a sigh:</p>
               <p>"I do hope they will be happy!"</p>
               <p>"And so do I; and I really believe they will be, for both of them have sweet
                  tempers and good common sense; those are the qualities that are likely to ensure
                  the felicity of married folks."</p>
               <p>"But it is a great risk for Bob to run; and for Bessie too, for that matter."</p>
               <p>"So it is; but it is a risk that may fairly be taken when the judgment gives
                  approval to the choice of the heart. Lovers do not bother themselves, however, a
                  great deal with the possibilities of the future. They have only sunshine now, and
                  it seems as if so clear a sky could never breed cloud and storm. It is a happy
                  thing for them, as well as for the rest of us, that no human ingenuity can lift
                  the veil that shuts<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6059-00000199"/> from our eyes the
                  mysteries of the years to come. Think what a journey it is that began to-day!
                  Separate and apart they have come thus far; but now they are to travel during all
                  their lives together, over rough places as well as where the way is smooth. The
                  power of each over the happiness of the other is infinite. He can make her wholly
                  miserable, and she can utterly destroy his peace. A violent demonstration is not
                  required. A little indifference at first, a harsh word, then a growing coldness,
                  then neglect, and for ever afterward complete separation of heart and soul and
                  feeling, though outwardly they seem united.</p>
               <p>"And even if they should be as happy as the most blessed of us, it is well that
                  their imaginations should throw about the future a glamour which will hide the
                  reality. A tried and well-proved love will hardly bear the shock when misfortune
                  and poverty come; it sometimes permits an almost fatal display of ill-temper when
                  there are sleepless nights with sick and peevish children, when the soul is vexed
                  with the cares of business, with the smaller trials of life, and with the myriad
                  petty annoyances that are encountered in the path of every man. There are few of
                  us who are heroes among the troubles of common life. Perhaps we bear the heavy
                  blows courageously enough; but we cry out when we are stung by the pigmy arrows
                  that are shot at us every day, at home and in the world. The truly great man is he
                  who is patient and forbearing beneath small vexations. The real hero is he who
                  bears the burden of his life, with its swarm of minor troubles, with calm, sweet
                  evenness of temper and with steadfast courage. The peevish and the irritable are
                  the enemies of peace in this world. Our lad and lass, we may hope, will find a
                  place for themselves among those who wisely choose the better part.</p>
               <p>"And now, Mrs. Adeler, would it not be well to close our record, as the hero and
                  the heroine depart? It is the custom in the novel and upon the stage, to end the
                  story when the knight and the lady who have loved and suffered through all the
                  pages and all the acts are made man and wife. We have not done much with our pair;
                  but it is enough that we have told a simple story of an old passion in still
                  another form, and that we have given the chronicles of the village with what
                  quality of humor we could infuse into them, but without malice or vulgarity and
                  without irreverence. I have no patience with those who seek to find amusement by
                  committing these faults. There is matter enough in harmless things for
                  sportiveness; and rather than try to excite mirth by hurting the feelings of my
                  neighbors, by stooping to coarseness, or by speaking with levity of things that
                  are sacred, I would consent to write only books that should be as solemn as
                  tragedy itself. We have had some strange experiences since the record began, and
                  we should be very dull indeed if we had not learned something from them. Of one
                  thing we are completely convinced: it is that a man who is made miserable because
                  his neighbors will not do as he wishes them to do had better not come to this or
                  any other village with the intent to be made happy. The man who voluntarily
                  becomes a hermit is a fool. A man of sense must necessarily desire to live with
                  his fellows and to enjoy their society, their sympathy and the comforts that can
                  be obtained with their assistance. He can have these only by making sacrifices for
                  them. He must not only give up some of his natural rights as an individual, but he
                  must make up his mind to endure patiently disagreeable things that are done by his
                  neighbors. He may flee from the city to escape the professor of music who hammers
                  a piano ceaselessly, but in his new home he will certainly find a compensating
                  nuisance of some kind. Until all men learn to think and act alike, he will find
                  everywhere in the world those who are fond of the things that he hates, and who
                     will<pb n="398" xml:id="VAC6059-00000200"/> do things that he thinks should be
                  left undone. The man, therefore, who comes to the village in pursuit of perfect
                  peace and quiet of course will not find them. He will encounter the disagreeable
                  practices and peculiarities of other people precisely as he did in the city; he
                  will be called upon to endure annoyances as aggravating as any of those from which
                  he has flown. He can have comparative contentment and repose in either place only
                  by determining to have them despite his neighbors. It is probable that men will
                  always have in this world sharp corners and rough surfaces with which they will
                  jag and tear each other as they roll onward in the swift current of life. Perhaps
                  we shall have smoothness and evenness when we enter Paradise. I hope so, at any
                  rate. And meantime let us all stop growling about evils which cannot be cured.</p>
               <p>"And now I will conclude our meek little story. Perhaps regretfully I will close
                  the door through which the public has been suffered to peep in upon the movements
                  of our quiet life at home and in the village, and thus will end the spectacle.
                  That life will continue, but it shall be sacred to ourselves, and the events that
                  give it interest shall go unrecorded."</p>
