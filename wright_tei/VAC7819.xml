MY DEAR READERS:&#xD;
I GLANCED into the "Autocrat " this morning, and&#xD;
saw something. I liked so much that I thought I&#xD;
would speak a 'few words to yo  in the same vein.&#xD;
I am not fond of flourishing ti  say-so of other&#xD;
people, or trimming my actions and ideas to any-&#xD;
body's pattern.&#xD;
If a "store-clerk" interrupts my consideration of&#xD;
the dead black silk I am about to buy, by telling&#xD;
me, ''butiful piece of goods, ma'am; Mrs. Judge&#xD;
Sampson took a dress of it this morning," I am quite&#xD;
apt to toss away the fabric and say, "'Oh' indeed! if&#xD;
that be so, I won't take one."&#xD;
The say-so I had in mind was about writing to Au.-&#xD;
thors your opinion of their works. Many writers pro-&#xD;
nounce "'book letters " a bore and nuisance. I don't.&#xD;
I like.them. A young maid let me know that Sonsie&#xD;
Eagan's thoughts and doings inspired her with cour-&#xD;
age to fight fate and conquer caste ; a woman sent me&#xD;

word that the busy usefulness of the Roaring River&#xD;
girls fired her with energy and resolution to fill her&#xD;
life with work; and one wrote to me how lie desired&#xD;
"truth, purity, delicacy, culture," more after walk-&#xD;
ing py the side of our Chris through her trials; and I&#xD;
must tell you that my very soul sang for gladness&#xD;
in gettingthese good messages. I thank you for the&#xD;
pleasant letters you have sent me. I treasure them&#xD;
all carefully.&#xD;
could bear dispraise, if it were honest. There is&#xD;
a small lassie who walks about my place, as straight&#xD;
as a reed, as merry and full of fun as tricksy Puck=--&#xD;
often carrying a volume under her arm and when I&#xD;
come upon her in a cosey nook reading, I- say,&#xD;
"What is it to-day, Lux?" and she replies, "That&#xD;
nauseating attempt at a novel called 'Widow Gold-&#xD;
smith's Daughter," repeating the words of a California&#xD;
critic upon the first scribble I sent you. Lux is not&#xD;
reverent; she calls me " dear old woman," she finds&#xD;
Fault with my stories, catches me tripping in my uni-&#xD;
ties: ,but I don't mind ; it is easy to be kind to those&#xD;

THE MARRIED, BELLE.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RED COTTAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
N ancient nursery called "Eden " has.some-&#xD;
times received favorable notice as a tolerably&#xD;
fine garden, although no catalogue of its col-&#xD;
lection has been preserved, which is a pity,.  One&#xD;
John Milton mentioned a few 'sti4gards, such as&#xD;
" woodbine, ivy,,roses, myrtle," etc., but in so un,&#xD;
scientific, desultory a manner, as to be entirely ui-&#xD;
satisfactory to thorough. gardeners. We- all know a&#xD;
plant can give no solid pleasure to a trp4 e florist which&#xD;
has not a Latin 'name at least three syllables long, it&#xD;
being as indispensable as a pedigree t9 a horse, or a&#xD;
crested grandfather to a genteel family.&#xD;

THE RED C TTAGE.&#xD;
Eden bore no thorns or t istles,no weeds; and we&#xD;
are told by the aforesaid  ilton that all work about&#xD;
the place consisted,-in "lo ping, propping; pruning,&#xD;
and binding."  An exceed ng stupid, stale, flat state&#xD;
of affairs. Such a nursery may have suited Adam&#xD;
and Eve, those young people being but novices in&#xD;
the complex arts of hybridizing, forcing, dwarfing,&#xD;
and budding; but I would not be afraid to wager on&#xD;
the amount of satisfaction they got out of their la-&#xD;
bor, after 'they found diffic ties to grapple with, fa-&#xD;
tigues to be endured.&#xD;
Fancy Adam tugging might and main at a great,&#xD;
strong,, healthy burdock, for instance, whose long,&#xD;
yellow root is busy sucking jurces from the breast of&#xD;
its mother Earth, satisfied to dwell in seclusion, and&#xD;
labor in secret to support the children it has pushed&#xD;
up into the world, and which declines to be dragged&#xD;
-_into society it has no capacities for. What a jolly&#xD;
keel-over our excellent fore-daddie got, when at last&#xD;
heprevailed- and dragged the obstinate thing forth in&#xD;
his two fists ! How he and Eve laughed at the fun&#xD;
siting on the fresh -smelling mould, wiping from their&#xD;
brows the. honest 'sweat ! They probably talked it&#xD;
over: perlYaps our maternal parent was busy with the&#xD;
family sewing, her vegetable-ivory thimble on her&#xD;
round finger, and her devil's darning-needle merrily&#xD;
yflyig while she made becoming little aprons and&#xD;
things. The flaming sword was glancing and swing-.&#xD;
ing every which way in front of 'the old platation ;&#xD;
but bless you ! they'd got through lI g and&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RED COTTAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
'I3&#xD;
&#xD;
propping -and lolling about in arbors.  Their lives&#xD;
those later times were full of. steady work, and -no&#xD;
strikes.&#xD;
Weeds grow with ex-Eden .facility in the Red Cot-&#xD;
tage garden, but flowers grow there also lovingly, and'&#xD;
yield to our fostering care riches of beauty and sweets.&#xD;
Imagine that the shade has gone back on the dial-&#xD;
plate, and in place of breathing these sultry summer&#xD;
airs, think you feel upon your cheek the vigor-giving&#xD;
vernal breath of a clear May morning.&#xD;
The anemones and hyacinths are in full bloom,&#xD;
nodding and smiling in the gentle breeze, as they&#xD;
pour forth the complimepof the- season.  'It was&#xD;
the self-same Power Divine taught them to bloom&#xD;
and you to shine." The common mother is no step-l&#xD;
-dame to them. She embraces. them tenderly, and&#xD;
shelters their roots with the light touch you could&#xD;
wish when she enwraps your mortality in the. dim&#xD;
earth-house built for you ere.you were born.&#xD;
Among the borders and clumps tarries, trowel in&#xD;
hand, the lady Carlotta, fronr morn till dewy eve, on&#xD;
these fine spring days. She ardently loes her flowern&#xD;
pets; she says they know her, confide .in her, and&#xD;
communicate their inner life, their flowery -loes and&#xD;
joys; that she is on hand anddYoxglove terms with&#xD;
their Queen, who often consults her about "'Love in,&#xD;
a huddle,'" Love in idleness," "Love lies bleeding,"&#xD;
asking advice touching her " Bachelor's Buttons'"-se&#xD;
prone to entangle among the "_Maiden's hair "--her&#xD;
Sweet Williams, her. Mourning Brides her "Johnny&#xD;

&#xD;
Jumpups," too frisky and spry, and the "Jack" who&#xD;
desires to occupy a pulpit; her -"" Monk'Hoods,"&#xD;
"Cardinals," "Hooped Petticoats," and  'Ladies'&#xD;
Eardrops," and divers other solicitudes, showing&#xD;
that the cares and responsibilities of the sovereign&#xD;
must be. many and perplexing.&#xD;
Between ourselves, I regard the above statement as&#xD;
a cheerful phantasy. I could not take my Bible oath,&#xD;
though, that it is not fact.  No mortal can surely&#xD;
state the precise limit of another mortal's senses. Al-.&#xD;
though my dull airicles are not able to hear the tiny&#xD;
corn-blades springing dnder the ground, I couldn't&#xD;
undertake to aver that Fine Ear lies when he tells&#xD;
me the tinkling music is as vibrant a the' ringing of&#xD;
the fairy bells to his delicate perception. I don't deny&#xD;
anything : I only wish I was Fine Ear.-&#xD;
Carlotta looks extremely picturesque in her broad-&#xD;
brimmed .Canada hat of yellow wheaten straw, en-&#xD;
wreathed 'about with corn poppies. Maud Miller&#xD;
making hay was beautiful, I suppose, tfiough the pop-&#xD;
ular picture of her looks to my rustic eyes "like the&#xD;
most unprofitable sign of nothing." But Carlotta&#xD;
leaning on her spade would be a study of pith for a&#xD;
painter, and the homely hoe in her supple harids be..&#xD;
comes a gracious implement.&#xD;
The spirit of our surroundings is so roomy,&#xD;
leisurely, and thought-permitting; that I believe I&#xD;
should leave off inditing good matter to you, my&#xD;
precious readers, andfall dreaming, wereit not for&#xD;
the chippering, hcppig, fluttering, and unrest of a&#xD;
g;  -unrst-, f&#xD;
&#xD;
company of blue-birds upon the low roof of the old&#xD;
porch ,below my "crow's. nest,"' who ,have, thrust&#xD;
their vital, vivacious bird-life upon the serene stillness&#xD;
of country r@se. They are some while ago re-&#xD;
turned from southern travel, and have not nearly&#xD;
finished talking up their adventures among the rice-&#xD;
fields ,and sugar-cane. The big fellow perched on&#xD;
the eave-trough, dipping hither and thither in the&#xD;
sunlight, bringing- to -view his rich azure feathers&#xD;
with their purple reflections, his jetty black pens&#xD;
andtail, and the! ruddy chestnut of his shining sides,&#xD;
and pouring forth his voluble notes, has been 'in&#xD;
Washington. There is " doings. of Congress" and&#xD;
"human progress " in every toss of his plumed head,&#xD;
and every knowing glance of his bright eye, para=&#xD;
doxical as the connection may appear. Last year&#xD;
his mate reared a great cow-bird in the rustic'cottage&#xD;
planned and built for her use by Cariotta, with a&#xD;
jack-knife, from four ,pine shingles ; neglecting her&#xD;
own offspring to feed the intruder, feeling all the&#xD;
while that there was a screw loose, but not able to&#xD;
comprehend how it had come to passthat she had&#xD;
hasd such greatness -thrust upon her. Now that. he&#xD;
las fini hed his oration, amidst applause, and clapping&#xD;
of wing, he'and she are going away.to visit the old&#xD;
house, which; feels like home, still; -and plan s0me&#xD;

doings, she gathered her offerings just as' carefully,&#xD;
and with as unalloyed enjoyment, as if her labor of&#xD;

wink at each other's little foibles. Carlotta's wIk is&#xD;
the vyer inspiration of mischief, and tells more effec-&#xD;
tually than a loud laugh of mine. She i the 'cutest,&#xD;
sharpest, wittiest little female I happen to know.&#xD;
Going from home as I do sometimes, I. find other&#xD;
women insipidly wanting in flavor ; and it was not&#xD;
till I arrived at years of comparison, that I ascertained&#xD;
the reason to be this same Carlotta's piquant origin-&#xD;
ality; full of anecdote, of quips and quirks and&#xD;
funny gibes. Of course, being two women to one&#xD;
man, Henry occasionally finds himself in a miserable&#xD;
minority; and is fain to retire from contested fields,&#xD;
unlaurelled; but being like our Southern neighbors,&#xD;
who didn't know when they were whipped, he is l-&#xD;
ways ready to renew the tournament with undaunted&#xD;
cou ge and burnished weapons.&#xD;
Our Red Cottage garden is a famous place for&#xD;
studying nature; not only flower, bird, insect, and&#xD;
reptile, but the. real unadulterated hurhan in its Va-&#xD;
rious aspects"and phases. It was but the other day;&#xD;
we were working. The complete we includes Henry,&#xD;
Carlotta, and Serena ; good, honest names, bestowed&#xD;
by our excellent, and much revered parents, in&#xD;
Christian baptism, when they Ystood together at the&#xD;
font with as serious faces and prayerful hearts as the&#xD;
inopportune squalling of their hopefuls would permit.&#xD;
My' mother received but coldly the condolences of&#xD;
the good lady who bewailed our uproarious be-&#xD;
havior because, as she said," it was a had omen if&#xD;
a baby cried not when the water of christening&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RED COTTAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
touched its forehead, and theant short- life for it."&#xD;
As I was saying, we knelt among our 'wind-flowers&#xD;
(the feminine-we, Henry being at is office), weeding&#xD;
diligently, when an ancient dame appeared, of dried&#xD;
and shrivelled aspect, and red eyelids, as of a dweller&#xD;
in the vicinage of a smoky chimney, and wafting upon&#xD;
the cirturhambient air a mixed odor, harm-fat, dish-&#xD;
water, onions, cabbage, and snuff. We "knew her&#xD;
well; she looked with such a look, -and she spoke&#xD;
with such a tone," that we recognized Mrs. Ramble,&#xD;
the truckrnan's wife. The Merry Bank people hold&#xD;
persistently the opinion that she is fond of watching&#xD;
and prying among her neighbors' affairs'; and she&#xD;
certainly knows all, about everybody. She came, I&#xD;
say, and leaned her elbows on our low picket4ence,&#xD;
and surveyed us and our surroundings with a com-&#xD;
prehensive sweep of the visual sense, inventorying&#xD;
ur apparel, noting our attitudes and occupation.&#xD;
" Mornin', Carlotty !" said she; presently, in a&#xD;
dried-up, wiry voice) as hard as her face  "I ain't&#xD;
goin' to stay a second hardly. Ye're diggin' away&#xD;
for dear 'life'!. folks say you're a dreadful sprycreatur'&#xD;

I see you want to meetin', any of ye. Oh, yes;.sh&#xD;
talked considerable about forgiveness. I expect some-&#xD;
body's been offendin' her. I guess as like as not it's&#xD;
you, Carlotty. You jes as lief tread on her toes as&#xD;
not. Sheprayed right out for you in female meetin'&#xD;
'last week, I 'spose you know."&#xD;
Me ! " exclaimed Carlotta; '"how thoughtful of&#xD;
her ! that accounts for my feeling so remarkably&#xD;
good-explains the placid benevolence of my hu-.&#xD;

"rThe land !.I believe you'd make fun if you was&#xD;
a-dyin' ! I hope you won't come to my funeral. I&#xD;
know you'd snicker if my'cap wa'nt on straight, or&#xD;

You little midget,- you! come, yank up some of&#xD;
them smoke-pipes. I'll carry 'em home to Alumzy&#xD;
Jane, to plant in her little bed ; she's desput fond of&#xD;
posies."&#xD;
Nay, dear Mrs. Ramble,. that is too rash a test&#xD;
of my benevolence; those are choice flowers. I can-&#xD;
not rise and give thee those, but here is a gay bunch&#xD;
of daffadowndillies she shall have, and welcome."&#xD;
She used her trowel to 'good purpose, and quickly&#xD;
lifted the roots fromtheir place, transplanted them to&#xD;
the dame's red cotton handkerchief, extended to re-&#xD;
ceive them ; and cutting short anaccount of a rife&#xD;
quarrel between Mrs. Pillhach'le and Mrs. Deacon'&#xD;
Rotterdam, embracing some strong opinions of Car-.&#xD;
gotta herself, exchanged during their last sword exer-&#xD;

lofty, who was just passing the toll-gate, to .convey&#xD;
to her lares and penates the excellent Mrs. Ramble.&#xD;
"How lucky !" said she; "now you can be in&#xD;
prime season for the evening meeting, and save your&#xD;
strength for the hymns.'&#xD;
Mr. Toplofty drew rei4 ; he couldn't well do less;&#xD;
but he made a grimace at me behind his hand, which&#xD;
was wrong; and Carlotta winked at us both and&#xD;
laughed.&#xD;
Wherefore such lavish generosity with my daffo&#xD;
dils?" inquired I, as he drove away. We could"&#xD;
hear the dame's voice uplifted above the clatter' of&#xD;
resounding hoofs and revolving wheels. "And why&#xD;
did you ruthlessly forceFsuch unwelcome company&#xD;
upon that friendless, unprotected young man ?&#xD;
" Put away a froward mouth, and -perverse lips&#xD;
keep far from thee," is a command. "I took the&#xD;
readiest method, the swiftest .conveyance - which&#xD;
offered," replied Carlotta, resuming her labor; "did&#xD;
not you hear her say '1I ain't goin' to stay a second&#xD;
hardly'? She always stops to tea when she utters&#xD;
those fearful words.  Smoke pipes, indeed . what&#xD;
sacrilege to so- misname. my true poet's lNiarcissus t&#xD;

ever turned her back on the place without borrowing&#xD;
something.&#xD;

&#xD;
Scarcely had Mr. Toplofty borne away his charge&#xD;
of mature virtue, and Carlotta was still in a ruffled&#xD;
stateof mind, when a man-stopped at the fence, and&#xD;
~after tying his steed to a thrifty young maple, ust&#xD;
putting forth its pale green leaves, and which, of&#xD;
=  course, the-animal cropped at its leisure, he: came&#xD;
through the=gate, leavingit ( ajar,oni. little, Ipray.&#xD;
you," and affording ingress to Jane Mallony's pig,&#xD;
who whisked his tail with delight as he followed in-&#xD;
the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor. His feet&#xD;
were. large (this coming man), and they throttled re-&#xD;
morselessly our lovely white pansies, took pitiless&#xD;
strides -across the mignonette, and effectually sup-&#xD;
pressed a young tiger-flower which was, getting&#xD;
courage to take its place amongst its peers. He&#xD;
held to his nose, en Passmet, a tulip plucked fromthe&#xD;
border, wherewith to refresh his sense as he walked,&#xD;
like Bunyan's pilgrim. It was named "Lady Mer-&#xD;
cer inthe catalogue, apple-scented and very choice..&#xD;
When he had inhaled a satisfactory sniff of the per-&#xD;
fume, he jerked it towards us.&#xD;
"Have you got_ any of these roots to spare,&#xD;
maam ? I gin a piece, of garden tomy darters to&#xD;
plant their posies, and I thought, as I was riding' by,&#xD;
I'd stop and git a few little things to begin on.&#xD;
You've got a nice sprinklin' of 'em, and I reckon you&#xD;
won't miss 'em-- should like a couple of these holly-&#xD;
hocks well enough" (grabbing at an early althea&#xD;
beside him).&#xD;
Carlotta cut into halves a wire-worm she caught,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RED COTTAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
thieving into the heart of a hyacinth bulb; before she&#xD;
pushed off her boad-brii, and shot a glance at the&#xD;
intruder, which covered him and the flowers he held.&#xD;
"The tulip you have there is only a couple of&#xD;
months from Holland, and has never bloomed be-&#xD;
fore," said she severely. "4(I never pluck my tulips&#xD;
but upon rare occasions; as you have broken it, I&#xD;
will sell you theiulb."&#xD;
She had grown crafty by the frequency of such&#xD;
applications. The Red Cottage stands upon a much r&#xD;
travelled road, in immediate vicinage of a toll-gate,&#xD;
where all the budding beauty of her; pets shines&#xD;
temptingly-upon the travellers pausing to deposit&#xD;
their three cents, for the u'se of the planks, with the&#xD;
lame keeper. "Yes, yes ! - them's the diggers,"&#xD;
exclaimed the flower-seeker, his eyes following&#xD;
anxiously the murderous slicing of the bright trowel,&#xD;
"and they're harder to kill'n a cat, ain't they.? well,&#xD;
how much 'd you tax for some of these red roses,&#xD;
pulling a full-cupped splendens from our best per-&#xD;
petual, and adding it to his collection. Though a&#xD;
trifle cast down at the idea of paying, he still re-&#xD;
solved to do the handsome things he had gone-so&#xD;
far. "I never did spend no money for such ginm-&#xD;
cracks, but Iwon't mind a sixpence or so to please&#xD;
my gals."&#xD;
"I cannot part with any more .of -my roses at any&#xD;
price," replied Carlotta, glowering, at the igst- and&#xD;
gone treasures, "but I will sell you that bulb for fiv&#xD;
dollars, and that is two less than it cost me."&#xD;

THE RED. COTTAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
:&#xD;
&#xD;
Positively it was .as good as a play, the look of&#xD;
blank, amazed affright which stole over the sun-dried&#xD;
countenance of the father of the gals. "Five dollars!'"&#xD;
he, repeated so slowly that the last syllable died in a&#xD;
subdued gurgle; dropping the blossoms thus rudely&#xD;
snatched from their parent stems, that he might slap&#xD;
his pockets with both hands, and convince himself&#xD;
that he had not already gone and acted the proverb,&#xD;
the last clause of which . is "soon parted."  No !&#xD;
thank Midas !-the old leathern wallet was there all&#xD;
right and tight, and as fat as ever. He hustled off&#xD;
without a reply to Carlotta's bland "Good-morning,'&#xD;
sir."  His horse, meantime, had not barked the&#xD;
pretty maple more than half around ; we tied it up,&#xD;
and hope it will live.&#xD;
Our stock of visitors was not exhausted, however,&#xD;
nearly so soon as our patience, because right away&#xD;
after the horseman had ,galloped off with spread&#xD;
elbows and bent knees, like Ichabod Crane riding to&#xD;
the fair Katrina, Mrs. Pillhackle pranced in, all brisk-&#xD;
ness, black garments, jet ornaments, and grief. She&#xD;
demanded "-something white and pure-looking " for&#xD;
the only little Pillhackle which had ever put forth&#xD;
from the parent stem, and after a:sob or two, and all&#xD;
the wriggles and unpleasant faces it knew how to&#xD;
execute, had retired from the scene and left the pair&#xD;
lamenting. Mrs. Pillhackle informed us, as if .the&#xD;
avowal were a proclamation of severe Spartan virtue,.&#xD;
that she had always kept a bouquet of :flowers on,&#xD;
baby's grave ever since she buried him ; a fact so&#xD;

patent to us, that she need scarcely have mentioned&#xD;
it, because we had been honored by being permitted&#xD;
to " furnish forth" the bouquet ever since that sad&#xD;
event. So there went the best of the white pansies,&#xD;
hyacinths, and snow-drops, to wither in the forlorn&#xD;
old burying-ground.&#xD;
"'There ." ejaculated Carlotta; "who next ?"&#xD;
"Egypt's royal qtieen, which the same is her name-&#xD;
sake," replied I, pointing out a smiling female of the&#xD;
colored variety, who requested, with the cheerful, soft-&#xD;
voiced alacrity peculiar to her race, to have '"a few&#xD;
posies for my husband's funeral; he's going' to be&#xD;
buried this afternoon, and wouldn't Miss Sereny&#xD;
lend me a black shawl fur to wear."&#xD;
.As Cleopatra, commonly called Pate, was our char-&#xD;
woman, who sometimes cut loose from her husbands&#xD;
without the ceremony of burying them, we were&#xD;
quite willing to encourage her attempts at decency,&#xD;
and we administered to her necessities.&#xD;
"Now I know there isn't any one else. to come,"&#xD;
said Carlotta, as Pate departed,'brimful of the ap-&#xD;
proaching festivity in which she was to shine as chief&#xD;
mourner. "I know there can't be !"&#xD;
She was mistaken; a bevy of school-girls from Miss&#xD;
Stratton's "female Seminary" were already in sight,&#xD;
and came crowding through the gate, chatting, gig.&#xD;
gling, and skipping among the other flowers like&#xD;
animated rose-buds.. They wanted. specimensAo&#xD;

good, and'had such pretty ones. I mustsay Ienjoy-&#xD;

ed their fresh nonsense (I* do like young girls), and I&#xD;
supplied their wants with pleasure, It took about a&#xD;
peck of blossoms to ,meet the, demand, not including&#xD;
the handful of lilies of the valley I privately bestowed&#xD;
upon little Flora Cresswell for .her sweet similitude&#xD;
therewith, and I rather stood between them  and&#xD;
Carlotta, whose replies 'began to wax short and&#xD;
sharp, like the snip of her pruning scissors ; and they&#xD;
were scarcely off before. she dashed down her gloves&#xD;
in despair.&#xD;
" Shut the door, good John," said she, " and say I'm gone to bed ;&#xD;
Oh, shut the door ! and say I'm sick, I'm dead!"&#xD;
She strode away leaving me to follow at my leisure,&#xD;
which I did just in time to catch an often request&#xD;
from Bill Ramble, who approached with a. basket on&#xD;
his arm-" S'Gorton, s'mapples?"     I knew   the&#xD;
meaning of the demand, being accustomed to his&#xD;
idiotic--I beg pardon-idiomatic use, of the vernacu-&#xD;
lar. It always reminded me of the old red school-&#xD;
house where the boys used .to pop up and say,&#xD;
Master, maint I g'-out-; t' git-s'mice to put'n my&#xD;
jacket t' keep ma nose from    bleed'n?"   After&#xD;
dispatching him to Winnie, I ascended to Carlotta's&#xD;
room, and entering- unbidden, I sat down by the&#xD;
window. "Good Gardener," said I, " I have come&#xD;
to read you my little bit of writing about our Red&#xD;
Cottage."&#xD;
Better indite a sonnet to the Harpies," replied&#xD;
she concisely.'&#xD;
&#xD;
." On the contrary, you (know you enjoy extremely&#xD;
this pleasuregiving., and you would miss these daily&#xD;
visits and requests from your life, feeling as if your&#xD;

"Well, well, Serena, go.on with your abuse-that&#xD;

THE REtD COTTAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
There's a little garden just below,&#xD;
Where hyacinths and daisies grow,&#xD;
And the bright anemone;&#xD;
And a gentle river runs along&#xD;
And sings a happy, gladding song.&#xD;
There grows the sweet forget-me-not :&#xD;
It tells a story to my heart,&#xD;
Of love, true love.&#xD;
The rooms within are low and small,&#xD;
One single picture deces the wall.-.&#xD;
Our mother's form.&#xD;
I've watched it when the sun went down,&#xD;
And te golden clouds grew dark and&#xD;
brown;&#xD;
I've fancied that the placid face,&#xD;
Where lingering love has left sweet trace,&#xD;
Has smiled on me:&#xD;
It looked all love.&#xD;
Dear love.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, they would grow if people would.&#xD;
only leave them alone"&#xD;
"'River' I Gully Brook, I suppose : a&#xD;
muddy, galloping, trolloping thing, always&#xD;
full of chips and sticks, and bordered&#xD;
with pig-pens and hen coops, 'gladding&#xD;
song !?"'&#xD;
&#xD;
I noticed that Carlotta's stinging. comments sub-&#xD;
sided when'I came to the forget-me-nots[ and also&#xD;
that her fingers played restlessly with the little shell&#xD;
combs she held. I knew right well that she had a&#xD;
heart of her own, to which the smallmodest vergisz-&#xD;
meinnicht had never ceased to speak.. I watched her&#xD;
that day, before the Astor sailed. out in the garden,&#xD;
picking the little starry-eyed things; I saw her&#xD;
divide them into two clusters, and I know where her&#xD;
half are, still hidden-up in a queer old box; she didn't&#xD;
know I saw her;. I never told; her, but I won't reveal&#xD;
her secrets.&#xD;
That last verse is very nice, Serena," said she&#xD;
softly, after a brief silence. "Mother has got a&#xD;
saint's face, the poor blind mother I she used to call&#xD;
us her live senses. ' I love to think about it, and the&#xD;

supplied the missing sight, so well, that she saw with&#xD;
your eyes, and I-ah ! I might have done better,&#xD;
but I loved her. I don't believe the youngest is ever&#xD;

"You make the richness and flavor of the place&#xD;
dear," said I; "our beloved is a garden of spices.&#xD;
"Thank you for your-two-sided compliment. ' . I&#xD;

"I am glad you approve -ny poem, Carlotta,&#xD;
because I am thinking of sending it to the ' Crispy&#xD;

"Do, by .all means," Carlotta rose briskly; she&#xD;
heard the little gate clang, and her black eyes caught&#xD;
sight of a familiar .figure from the window. She ex-&#xD;
changed her mood of softened retrospect for a house-&#xD;
keeper's bustle. ."Heny is coming to dinner," said&#xD;
she, "with law-suits bristling all over him,'and the&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;

THE SWEET SINGERS OF ISRAEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
OU will be pleased, my own readers, to-&#xD;
know. that we Red Cottageites belong to the&#xD;
Stone Church choir. Henry blows the flute&#xD;
and fills the chorister's chair, Carlotta leads the so-&#xD;
prano, and I- have the alto all to myself,.&#xD;
We take-great credit to ourselves, that we are al-&#xD;
wvays in our places of a Sunday, be it sunny or&#xD;
cloudy, wet or dry, cold or hot. Snowstorms are to&#xD;
us feathery delights ; we revel in them, we wrap our&#xD;
cloaks about us, and up we g 0--excelsior ! over the&#xD;
hill, over the canal bridge, pas the quiet stores,&#xD;
around corners, cleared for the day of loafing gentry;&#xD;
cleared of dozing old farm-horses, and dingy wagons,&#xD;
past saloons and beer-shops, from whence our holy&#xD;
r      Sabbath has .turned forth their lounging tipplers,&#xD;
or hidden them in back places ; past village homes,&#xD;
&#xD;
right, to the church steps. Sure as the bell tolls we&#xD;
are there, in our places ; ready to rise into the very&#xD;
inspiration of psalmody, float in it, soaring on&#xD;
devotional wings.&#xD;
Do not for a moment suppose that we Red Cot-&#xD;
tageitesrconstitute the choral body ; on the contrary,&#xD;
many and many pretty maids come smiling in, bring-&#xD;
ing sunshine with them, at the call of the Sabbath&#xD;
bell, and with a rustle and a flutter settle behind the&#xD;
red curtain which shelters our sanctum from the pro-&#xD;
fane gaze ; and dimpled fingers, incased in fairy little&#xD;
gloves, agitate the leaves of the National Psalmody,&#xD;
when our pastor names the hymn, and young voices&#xD;
pour forth their fresh sweetness,-let us hope 'some-&#xD;
times acceptably, in orison-worship to our Heavenly&#xD;
Father.&#xD;
Besides these; on the bass side of our gallery, t4ere&#xD;
are, stalwart figures and thoughtful faces, the staple&#xD;
of our manhood, "praising God-and saying Halle-&#xD;
lujah'!" Among them for years and years, in fact&#xD;
long before I attained to the dignity of first alto, a&#xD;
stout-built, sturdy Dutchman has stood and - sung,&#xD;
firm as the everlasting hills, digging foundation deep&#xD;
'for his heavy tones,. grinding them'hp by the card-&#xD;
not always to the chord  perfectly regardless of the&#xD;
winks and nudges passing among his neighbors, or&#xD;
the, vehement adjurations of the afflicted chorister&#xD;
in rehearsals, or his stage whispers in hymn-time:&#xD;
"Piano ! Deacon Rotterdam; Pianissimo; affetuoso !&#xD;
and do not beat time with your boot, if you please,&#xD;
Deacon Rotterdam."   Carlotta says the good man&#xD;

(f&#xD;
&#xD;
sings with the understanding also. Not a whit cares&#xD;
he; sometimes I think he really enjoys the nervous fid-&#xD;
gets his gritty grinding awakes in our sensitive Harry,&#xD;
and his frowning expression of the same. Indeed, he&#xD;
once said to a friend in confidence:&#xD;
"I don't b'lieve Gorton wants me to sing up gal-&#xD;
lery, and for that very reason I'm going' to sing."&#xD;
He is thoroughly orthodox, is Deacon Rotterdam,&#xD;
to the back-bone ; says he don't find any proof in&#xD;
his Bible that infants are saved, and is content to pin&#xD;
his faith to old John Calvin's coffin--burrowing in the'&#xD;
dark ages, and hugging the breme and ghastly belief.&#xD;
that they are all damned-probably, notwithstand&#xD;
ing he has young ones of his own pegetting around&#xD;
his hearthstone.  I remember quite well how&#xD;
ashamed I used to feel for him, when, a little lassie, I&#xD;
had to sit and listen to his weekLy confessions of&#xD;
guilt in the evening conference ; and as I was just in&#xD;
the Decalogue for my Bible-lessons, I used to look at&#xD;
him, and, fit into him every commandment on the&#xD;
stone tablets, and wonder which he had last wickedly&#xD;
broken, and why he made a point of telling his fellow-&#xD;
sinners, instead of his God.&#xD;
Deacon Rotterdam looks askance at all innovations&#xD;
and improvements, even in the form of a contribu-&#xD;
tion-box, and stumps doggedly up and down the&#xD;
aisles, poking the long-handled money-chests under&#xD;
our noses, which our grandfathers contrived; he says,&#xD;
"they're just right, "good enough," and- though&#xD;
the little kists are battered and worn; he, won't hear&#xD;
of new ones. If a stray fiddle chance to find its way&#xD;
&#xD;
into'the alto seat, he anathematizes, it in good set&#xD;
terms, and advises, with a pious frown, to turn, out&#xD;
the irreverent interloper, neck and heels. Our worthy&#xD;
Rotterdam has never digested the good old Catholic&#xD;
doctrine, " in essentials, unity ; in non-essentials, lib-&#xD;
erty ; in all things, charity?'&#xD;
Any unlucky dog who happens to thrust, his pry-&#xD;
ing nose within the church-door 'during service is&#xD;
sure to attract the ever-watchful eye of the deacon,&#xD;
and he directly rises, clothed in majesty of office and&#xD;
squeaking boots, and kicks out the intruder, with no&#xD;
show of the Christian quality of mercy. His long&#xD;
swallow-tail keeps time to the motionof his heavy&#xD;
legs; his obstinate mouth dropped at the corners and&#xD;
his eyebrows threateningly gathered together are quite&#xD;
terrible to see, and poor Tray departs sniffling and&#xD;
whining, feeling perhaps that he might have kept&#xD;
better company. The small boys giggle and the&#xD;
little girls get pale,'and a diversion from the order&#xD;
of worship is created, and a few smiles, unbecoming&#xD;
the place, play about the composed faces of the older&#xD;
church-goers ; and the good man squeaks back to&#xD;
his pew, feeling that he has done holy service, and&#xD;
vindicated beyond all question the sacred solemnity&#xD;
of the consecrated house. Once, however, he drew&#xD;
upon himself an angry retort he little expected, from&#xD;
the owner of a smallish black puppy who had -"a&#xD;
turn for goin' to meetin'." He delighted to accom-&#xD;
pany his mistress, and when serion was about half&#xD;
over, would rise on his hind legs, place his fore paws&#xD;

on the seat-back, and .inspect the congregation with&#xD;
ludicrous gravity, and was quite likely to elevate his&#xD;
nose and his, voice during our psalmody with plain-&#xD;
tive, soul-harrowing howls; he would pit-pat through&#xD;
the aisles, and trot up and down the pulpit stairs,&#xD;
making the most of the larger liberty of animals.'&#xD;
Deacon Rotterdam  disliked this dog: he wouldn't&#xD;
stay put, he wouldn't be quiet, and he bore down&#xD;
upon him horsewhip in hand; the lash overreached;&#xD;
but bringing up his corps de reserve--his Sunday&#xD;
boot-he sent him yelping, not out at the door, but&#xD;
in hiding behind the old gray skirt he knew he was&#xD;
always a welcome puppy to couch upon. She was&#xD;
an elderly maiden was the owner, and her dog was&#xD;
dear to her; she rose with puffed-out cheeks and&#xD;
fiery eyes glaring, and calling her injured pet over&#xD;
her shoulder, snapping her fingers and puckering her&#xD;
lips to say, "Pink,- Pink!"  As she reached the&#xD;
door, Pink, close at her heels, she faced about, and&#xD;
jerked her chin at the deacon, who was awaiting her&#xD;
exit, with elbows squared and a ducked-in head, like&#xD;
a determined rhud-turtle, and exclaimed in an aggra-&#xD;
vated undertone, brought low by respect to the&#xD;
church, and concentrated. by rage at its officer,&#xD;
"Kick a daag, will ye! and a deacon, tu;" and so&#xD;
slamming the door she seemed to shake off the dust&#xD;
from her feet, for she never came to sit among us in&#xD;
heavenly places again. The Revere1 % metheus&#xD;
akepeace mildly reasoned with his official upon his&#xD;
overt acts, "interrupting the service," distracting the&#xD;
people, giggling tle children, "'twas throwing words&#xD;

away," for "the deacon .still would have his will,"&#xD;
and answered:&#xD;
"There's no use in dogs going to -meeting ; if they&#xD;
don't keep away, I'll lick 'em." We have gone on&#xD;
singing our hymns in our own fashion-, Sunday after&#xD;
Sunday, up in our choir, for years and- years. No&#xD;
ong has thought of invading our hallowed precincts,&#xD;
or calling us to account for our doings. When we&#xD;
acquitted ourselves well, the congregation' would&#xD;
smile blandly into their. hymn-books, approbatively&#xD;
beating time ; and when by any unlucky accident a&#xD;
tune got warped in our handling, they only made wry&#xD;
faces, sometimes going -so far as to cast reproachful&#xD;
glances at the red curtain ; but upon the whole, they&#xD;
looked up to us kindly, and respected our perform.-&#xD;
ances.  But during all these speeding years there&#xD;
had been perfecting and maturing, among the majes-&#xD;
tic old trees of down-east Maine, a tall, lank Yankee,&#xD;
whose enterprise brought him one summer to refresh&#xD;
the dwellers of Merry Bank with the light of his re-&#xD;
markable presence. Squiirmwell was his name, and he&#xD;
and his equally tall and lank wife, did not approve&#xD;
our psalmody.  Soon our true and tried adherents&#xD;
began to fall off, one by one. Faint whispers reached&#xD;
our ears, that somebody had told somebody else, that&#xD;
his brother's wife said that her uncle's mother-in-law&#xD;
had heard Judge Ashcroft say in the post-office that&#xD;
our music was behind the times ; and that Mr. Squirm&#xD;
well agreed with him that it did seem to be "dread-&#xD;
ful run deown, that's a fact, jest as true as you liver&#xD;
judge !-principal voices getting thin-and for my&#xD;

part, I don't think no great shakes of a flute in church,&#xD;
no way. Never had one in Shebunck, where I come&#xD;
from. I led the singin' there myself."&#xD;
As the new member was pretty busy heading com-&#xD;
mittees, blazing away at temperance meetings, and&#xD;
making himself, as-old Father Toplofty said, " amazing'&#xD;
conspicious everywheres," displaying ardent zeal, and&#xD;
also,,somewhiles, " the Roman infirmity of boasting ;"&#xD;
and his wife was quite as rampagious in her way,&#xD;
taking an active part in female prayer-meetings, as&#xD;
well as occasionally elevating her voice in promiscu-&#xD;
ous assemblies, in face of St. Paul's express prohibi-&#xD;
tion--we were at little loss to trace to its direct source&#xD;
the spreading disaffection.&#xD;
Before many months, Mr. and Mrs. Squirmwell be-&#xD;
came, by hook or crooks members of our choral&#xD;
body, he-executing the tenor, and she fending her&#xD;
vocal organs for the embellishment of the soprano.&#xD;
Though her rendering of the "neows and theous,"&#xD;
was a little prominent on the high notes, still .e ac-&#xD;
cepted their services, and considered them helps in a&#xD;
general way ; in short, we looked upon their incursion&#xD;
with as much favor as could reasonably be expected&#xD;
be shown to " new uns" by old incumbents. But&#xD;
alas!1 we found ere, long to our cost that we were&#xD;
somewhat in the position of the youngusband, who&#xD;
-complamed to his father-in-law that his wife wouldn't&#xD;
be mistress of her own hooe-&#xD;
Oh yes, she will, I guess, Ben, if you'll let her,"&#xD;
replied the old gentleman,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SWEET SINGERS OF ISRAEL.     37&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, she won't, darn her;! "- rejoined the tried&#xD;
spouse.  "I tell you, .dad, she's determined to be&#xD;
master !&#xD;
While our new stone church was in process of&#xD;
building, our choir were busy, after the manner of all&#xD;
choirs from time immemorial, talking and whispering&#xD;
in corners and by-places about the seats to be as-&#xD;
sumed by particular individuals; each claiming pre-&#xD;
cedence of somebody,; each stoutly declaring that he.&#xD;
or she wouldn't sing a note at any price, unless cer-&#xD;
tain coveted positions could be theirs, allotted beyond&#xD;
all doubt or question. Some of our body -carried&#xD;
their grievances to our minister, but he, like a wise&#xD;
and prudent pastor as he is, kept carefully aloof from&#xD;
all expression of opinion, intrenching himself behind&#xD;
"hums !" and " ah indeeds ! " as behind a wall.&#xD;
One Saturday evening at rehearsal, we were all&#xD;
quietly deposited behind the red curtain, except the&#xD;
Squirmwells.  Henry named "Antioch " as the&#xD;
"morsel" for practice, and the little bustle caused by&#xD;
the rustling of our singing-book leaves, as we found-the&#xD;
page, had subsided. We all sat erect with our fore-&#xD;
fingers raised, and our lips in position to send.forth&#xD;
the "Joy," as soon as the clear ringing of the chor-&#xD;
ister's flute should herald it, when an uplifted voice&#xD;
in our rear proclaimed in accents so purely Yankee,&#xD;
that no throat in Merry Bank, except a Squirmwell,.&#xD;
could by -any possibility utter them.&#xD;
"'You'll hef to move along deown there ; my wife&#xD;
don't set in no seat in this gallery but the top seat."&#xD;

&#xD;
All heads were instantly turned with this startling&#xD;
announcement, and- all mouths were a shade wider&#xD;
open than before with astonishment. There, to corro-&#xD;
borate the valiant assertion of her wedded lord, stood&#xD;
the female Squirmwell, in all the dignity of a new&#xD;
spring bonnet,. note-book in hand, quite ready and&#xD;
willing to, speak for herself. Directly before Carlotta&#xD;
the imposing figure reared its majestic height, "with&#xD;
head.uplift and eyes' that sparkling blazed," but as&#xD;
our little sister " showed no symptoms " of retiring,&#xD;
the forefinger of the determined intruder pushed sig-&#xD;
nificantly her plump shoulder.&#xD;
"What do you want?"' coolly inquired Carlotta.&#xD;
"Please set alongdeown."&#xD;
What for, pray?"&#xD;
So'st I can get in."&#xD;
"Impossible ! when I am thy captive, talk of chains,&#xD;
proud boasting cherub," was the reply .delivered in&#xD;
perfect sobriety, and a soft, quiet voice, which pro-&#xD;
yoked smiles from her neighbors, and entirely non-&#xD;
plussed Mrs. Squirmwell. As 'she was not able to&#xD;
shove out the speaker, however much she would have&#xD;
 liked to do it, she wheeled about, and espying a va-&#xD;
cancy at the end of the bass row, she slid into it.&#xD;
"Never mind then ; this'll be head neow; he, he!"&#xD;
Her husband responded with a confirmatory&#xD;
"putty good, ho, ho !" and'removing her gloves with&#xD;
perfect aplomb, the lady turned with easy grace to me,&#xD;
who was looking on in mute wonder to see how she&#xD;
was making herself as much at home under our vine&#xD;
&#xD;
und fig-tree, as she could have done' in the distant&#xD;
'forests of her native wilds.&#xD;
"What page is it, Sereny ? Oh I see ; tew thutty-&#xD;
tew, ahem-m-m ! "  She had ample time to clear&#xD;
her tuneful throat, because I grieve to add that Henry&#xD;
so far forgot his dignity as chorister, as to fall back&#xD;
in his official chair, and laugh so long and so loud,&#xD;
'"that it looked doubtful whether his lips could ever&#xD;
again pucker sufficiently to meetthe embouchure of&#xD;
his instrument. He stopped at last, though, as did we&#xD;
all, Carlotta included, whom this episode more in-&#xD;
tensely tickled than any of us. If Mrs. Squirmwell&#xD;
had known the little woman as I know her, I think.&#xD;
she would have assumed a less boastful front. Carlotta&#xD;
is quite apt to pay her debts, and I for one felt that&#xD;
the newly acquired headship would prove no sine-&#xD;
cure to its proud incumbent. You ought to have seen&#xD;
Squirmwell swing into the tune, swaying his lank body&#xD;
about like a rock-maple in a: high wind; and heard&#xD;
him render the consoling words, " Kamfurt the we-&#xD;
ack ; drei thur taares" swelling and dying away in up&#xD;
and down strokes, like a writing-master's best flour-&#xD;
ishes. He rejoiced as a strong man who runs a race.&#xD;
I did not mention this little matter to you, my&#xD;
readers, because it is especially devotional-I don't&#xD;
for an instant pretend that it is'; nor was our Saturday-&#xD;
night rehearsal particularly promotive of worship in&#xD;
our Sunday orisons-but only to show you that we of&#xD;
the choir in the Merry-Bank stone church were after all&#xD;
much like our neighbors.: no worse-not much better.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
&#xD;
HENRY'S FIRST GUEST.&#xD;
&#xD;
HAVE in my mind's eye a self-asserting lady,&#xD;
who has had considerable to say first and last&#xD;
about-" gala days-;'' but she was never at the&#xD;
Red Cottage, and consequently can-form no adequate&#xD;
conception of real gala days, such as we enjoyed. that&#xD;
summer when Kitty Clayton was with us, making glad&#xD;
our' earts by her joyous presence.&#xD;
I -must tell you how it came- about. The child's&#xD;
father was one of those migratory merchants, who do&#xD;
business in New Orleans, passing six or seven months-&#xD;
of each year among the mosquitoes and alligators, and&#xD;
the remainder in the North ; really living nowhere:&#xD;
keeping their families in some quiet nook, often the&#xD;
old homestead, and snatching brief intervals of do-&#xD;
mestic. pleasure with them--enough- to kep their&#xD;
hearts- warm, or make them sore, in the dreary inter-&#xD;
val of enforced absence.&#xD;
Paul Clayton's wife died while he was worrying his&#xD;
&#xD;
brain, taxing his energies, to make more money; and&#xD;
he dropped his uncompleted enterprises, and hurried&#xD;
home to Roaring River to find his hearthstone cold&#xD;
and. his dwelling empty, ; nothing left,, except the&#xD;
memory of household joys, of which she was the cen-&#xD;
tre and source ; and, hopes made almost certainties&#xD;
by the full assurance with which she had clung, to&#xD;
them. Oh yes, h ehad something left-alittle Mother-&#xD;
less girl, who had been his plaything and pet, but of&#xD;
whose needs for culture or care he had not the re-&#xD;
motest conception.; all that had been his wife's prov-&#xD;
ince. She was lying in the dead-house now, awaiting&#xD;
him in her coffin.&#xD;
He -took a look at the rigid face, which had not a&#xD;
smile for him. It seemed strange, so strange that his&#xD;
heart ached, and he could not help a shiver at the&#xD;
thought that her delicate limbs were cased in ice, and&#xD;
the kiss he took from the. frozen lips sent a dumb&#xD;
chill through him as if her- death had deadened his&#xD;
life. He, shut up the rooms to their -resounding&#xD;
emptiness ; locked the great hall-door, and never un-&#xD;
locked it again ; indeed, he sold the place afterwards&#xD;
to the Captain Slocum who married. Dulcet Petti-&#xD;
bone ; and after placing poor little Kitty at school,&#xD;
he went wearily back to his cotton press, a lonely,&#xD;
disappointed nan. He had been planning and work-&#xD;
ing for a' future - to be enjoyed in his native town,&#xD;
which he loved for its . beauty and its 'associations,&#xD;
with the wife for whom ie forswore the.society of all&#xD;
other women.&#xD;

"Only one year more, dearest," said he, when he&#xD;
kissed her at the gate, that last autumn leave-taking.&#xD;
"gOnly one year more," he repeated to himselfas he&#xD;
drove away, still watching. the slender figure, and&#xD;
noting the sudden' dropping of the pretty head into&#xD;
the clasped' hands. He-knew how fast the tears were&#xD;
falling.-tears which had been bravely kept back, that'&#xD;
he might remember her last look in his face, a smiling&#xD;
one. " Only one year more," and. these miserable&#xD;
partings will be over forever. And they were over&#xD;
vt forever, and his labors vanity and vexation of spirit;&#xD;
out of his great wealth he could only build a marble&#xD;
tomb to hold her coffin. Though his name had syl-&#xD;
labled itself in the dying breath from her faithful lips,&#xD;
he was not there to catch the sound, which melted into&#xD;
thin air, and was lost. Nothing but blank emptiness&#xD;
left out of all his magnificent projects, his great ex-&#xD;
pectations. But what of it ? hundreds of such for-&#xD;
lorn and chilly hearts are-beating funeral marches all-&#xD;
around us.&#xD;
" Clayton. has lost his wife," said a gentleman at&#xD;
the.St. Charles dinner-table, when the news reached&#xD;
New Orleans..&#xD;
" Yes ; poor fellow ! so i hear;" and that was all,&#xD;
though it is probable that some of the diners sent&#xD;
home a thought of dread among their own lares and&#xD;
penates. The' clatter of knives and forks went on;&#xD;
the political, argument was renewed, the last opera&#xD;
discussed; nobody.had sympathy to waste; all had&#xD;
their fortunes - to achieve, many with just such mo.&#xD;
&#xD;
tives as had pushed forward the widowed man they&#xD;
were discussing -so carelessly, and all pressed on in&#xD;
the eager chase.&#xD;
Paul Clayton too plodded on as usual. He had no&#xD;
especial incentive for changing his habits. It seemed&#xD;
much the same to him where he dined and slept ; life&#xD;
had got narrowed to extremely meagre limits-&#xD;
little daily treadmill in which he mechanically&#xD;
wrought ; and if his face grew paler and more worry&#xD;
and weary, he neither asked nor expected sympathy.&#xD;
Kittyhad never left Madame Devereaux's establish-&#xD;
ment in all the ten years which had elapsed since she&#xD;
was written motherless. She *had no near relations,&#xD;
her father being the last of the Claytons, and her&#xD;
mother an orphan. The Roaring River folks, the&#xD;
Bradshaws and Walsinghams, their old neighbors,&#xD;
paid her a few visits, and desired to fetch her away&#xD;
with them, but Madame declined to permit an absence&#xD;
unwarranted by her guardian, .and the child herself&#xD;
shrank from them as strangers. Her father though&#xD;
he lavishly supplied her with money, whia she as&#xD;
lavishly spent upon her whims and those of her&#xD;
school-mates, had 'ceased to express much fondness&#xD;
for his daughter in his infrequent calls ; and though&#xD;
she never forgot the old days of sweet petting, she&#xD;
left off expecting much, being one of those good little&#xD;
souls who drop easily into any niche, and accommo-&#xD;
date themselves to the inevitable. As she had no&#xD;
opportunity to measure her papa by;other papas,&#xD;
she accepted him as the general type of all father-&#xD;

hood, and his silence and reserve did not prevent her&#xD;
loving him truly, though it lost him a glance into the&#xD;

A direct and urgent appeal -from Henry to Paul&#xD;

meeting her at Madame Devereaux's was purely acci~ /&#xD;
dental. Going thither to place a ward (Henry has&#xD;
lots of wards of all sorts and sizes), he chanced to see&#xD;
Kitty on her pony ; and her sweet, childish face, and&#xD;
her equestrian grace, led him to inquire her name.&#xD;
He was utterly astonished to find her a daughter of&#xD;
the fellow he used to call "leetle Paul ; " and after a&#xD;
pleasant study of the fair maid, he desired to have&#xD;
her at the Red Cottage for, a season. Perhaps it was&#xD;
because he had known her parents, that Kitty's heart&#xD;
warmed toward the stranger;.or it might have been&#xD;
because he was nice, and kind, and genial ; but at&#xD;
any rate, she was glad to come away in his corppany&#xD;
-glad, even amidst the sorrow of turning her back&#xD;
upon the familiar faces ; and-she alighted among us&#xD;
one bright day like a merry sunbeam.&#xD;
Carlotta and I left everything to watch her. It&#xD;
seeded almost as if we were fifteen again, while we&#xD;
listened to tales of school-frolics "about the girls,"&#xD;
about the parlor nights, and the horrid old Made-&#xD;
moiselle who called names in French she dared 'not&#xD;
utter in English, when she gut in a passion. We&#xD;
followed Kitty's dancing progress among our flowers;&#xD;

IR NRY'S FIRST GUEST.&#xD;
&#xD;
out in the orchard ; we showed her the pigs and&#xD;
chickens, and gathered for her whole'apronfuls of&#xD;
tulips and daffadowndillies, and Carlotta crucified her&#xD;
affections, in that she plucked a handful of her best&#xD;
and newest roses, which she offered to the guest as&#xD;
at a shrine. She was as sweet and natural as a&#xD;
peach-blossom. All the polishing-at Madame Dev-&#xD;
ereaux's finishing establishment for young ladies--&#xD;
French, German, music, and everything extra-could&#xD;
not spoil Kitty. It was as much labor thrown away&#xD;
as t polish a white lily. She came from the hand&#xD;
of the good God so pure and perfect-so good and&#xD;
gentle-so overflowing with tenderness and dear&#xD;
love, that she could not be harmed by the most elab-&#xD;
orate system of boarding-school training in the vorld.&#xD;
She dropped into our quiet, country habits as easily&#xD;
as if she had been born under our roof-tree. We&#xD;
were never tired of watching her slight figure flitting&#xD;
about the old place, getting mirth, and amusement,&#xD;
and occupation out of everything.  She followed&#xD;
Henry down among the pear-dwarfs, carrying on her&#xD;
plump arm his label-basket, and poking plenty of&#xD;
fun at his dilapidated garden hat, and rusty old coat,&#xD;
which Carlotta had long ago christened the "Peck-&#xD;
sniffian costume." She watched the process 'of&#xD;
budding the young, straight, lithe trees, slender and&#xD;
vigorous, like her own elastic youth, with the pret-&#xD;
tiest little puckered-up, dimpled mouth, - and the&#xD;
busiest eyes imaginable. Even Mrs. Ramble took to&#xD;
her. Mrs. Ramble-saidshe was a "real likely little&#xD;

creator," and  told her upon her first visit that it&#xD;
would be a pity if such a nice, white skin should be&#xD;
scorched all up in everlasting torment, and exhorted&#xD;
her to get religion right away, and enforced her&#xD;
preachment with an encouraging stanza from her&#xD;
favorite hymn:&#xD;
"Behold the hardened sinner goes,&#xD;
Laden with guilt and heavy woes,&#xD;
Down to the regions of thedead,&#xD;
With endless curses on his head I&#xD;
The dust returns to dust again;&#xD;
The soul in agonies of pain&#xD;
Ascends to Heaven, not there to dwell,&#xD;
But hears her doom and sinks to Hell/ "&#xD;
As she sing-songed the time-honored rhymes,&#xD;
w hout taking her eyes off the blooming face, it&#xD;
naturally blanched a little under the Christian admo-&#xD;
n ion. We are told that there is a time for every-&#xD;
thing under the sun ; but Mrs. Ramble recognized&#xD;
all times as opportunities for talking goodie, goodie,&#xD;
which she called "laboring in the vineyard."     She&#xD;
brought her knitting and -spent the day, soon after&#xD;
Kitty came ; though she announced, a     she dropped&#xD;
her old bonnet with the horse-hair eve lastings upon&#xD;
the floor beside her, "that she      couldn't stay a&#xD;
second, hardly."&#xD;
We always expect to see Mrs. Ramble's rusty&#xD;
bombazine at an early period, when new guests&#xD;
arrive at the Red Cottage; with the inevitable blue&#xD;
sock she .is always footing for the truckman, and&#xD;

,which, like Penelope's weaving, never seems any&#xD;
nearer completion. She says she " allus thinks it is&#xD;

pany, 'cause then she feels as if she warn't puttin' on&#xD;
'em out any;   n' as they've got to be sprigged up&#xD;
all the while, and have lots of little notions on hand&#xD;
to eat."&#xD;
Mrs. Ramble professes vehemently to despise&#xD;
creature-comforts, and being one of those " cold-&#xD;
potato Christians," whose religion consists in attend-&#xD;
ing all sorts of meetings, travelling from house to&#xD;
house, and exhorting to reform, especially in any&#xD;
pleasure she is incapacitated to partake of, her family&#xD;
have very few opportunities for experiencing any sur-&#xD;
feit of home enjoyments.&#xD;
Mrs. Squirmwell also approved of Kitty. She came&#xD;
and hugged her, and asked her divers questions, read&#xD;
,a chapter with her, invited her to join her Sunday-&#xD;
school class, and told her Mr. Squirmwell wanted' to&#xD;
have her "come deown teown and take a dish of tea&#xD;
along of him "-we expected her also, because she&#xD;
drops her piety about promiscuously as- an ostrich&#xD;
does her eggs-and I laughed when Kitty came and&#xD;
said, 4"Oh Serena ! what an awful good woman 1"&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
" WHERE THE BEE SUCKS THERE LURK I."&#xD;
T is now several summers since we brought&#xD;
dur flower-garden to a -reasonable state of&#xD;
perfection, and being sure that it could hold&#xD;
no more " battle giants," "lady's delights," Baltimore&#xD;
Belles, or " parroquettes," we of the Red Cottage&#xD;
naturally bethought ourselves, that a few bee-hives&#xD;
would have an agreeable effect, scattered about among&#xD;
the low-branched apple-trees, besides paying us&#xD;
nobly with frequent caps of delicious honey.&#xD;
Kit North-peace to his ashes !--has said, "what&#xD;
is a cottage without bees ?" we, being fully of his&#xD;
opinion, decided in full conclave that a colony should&#xD;
be forthwith invited to domesticate themselves in our&#xD;
Arcadia, or, in other words, that we would brain them&#xD;
home and force them to stay as the Sabines did their&#xD;
wives so many years ago, when our old world was&#xD;
&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
If&#xD;
&#xD;
"WHERE THE BEE SUCKS THERE L URK I."&#xD;
young, and no " manuals of politeness " or " eti-&#xD;
quette of courtship " had been issued, before Carleton&#xD;
had got out the " Habits of Good Society."&#xD;
We selected to receive them .one of the greenest,&#xD;
shadiest spots in our whole domain, and erected:t ere&#xD;
a little temple dedicated to the Hivites ; not an of&#xD;
those pig-headed old heathen who were always giv g&#xD;
the descendants of Abraham so much trouble, cau&#xD;
ing them- to "pitch " here and there among the hills&#xD;
of Canaan, to the imminent risk of their patriarchal&#xD;
necks, but the industrious workers in wax of the&#xD;
tribe of Apis, who also number amongst them, as we&#xD;
found to our cost before summer ended, Hitites of&#xD;
the surest and most unerring aim.&#xD;
Our new ornaments looked so pretty and pictur-&#xD;
esque, so neat and white, showing above the green&#xD;
grass, and the busy inhabitants commenced to ply&#xD;
their trade from the very first with so much briskness&#xD;
and alacrity, flying hither and thither, with a sooth-&#xD;
ing, droning sing-song; saluting the apples-blossoms,&#xD;
diving into the honeysuckles, sipping at the violets,&#xD;
winging their way in select parties from successful&#xD;
excursions, filled with sweetness, loaded with yellow&#xD;
wax, that notwithstanding. we got inkling of some&#xD;
stormy debates going on in the house, of which we&#xD;
lobby-members failed to catch the significance, we&#xD;
still maintained a high state of satisfaction, and began&#xD;
already Barmecidially to enjoy the flavor of the deli-&#xD;
cate morsels we intended to roll under our tongues,&#xD;
and we beheld (also Barmecidially) great. masses of&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7819-00000025"/>&#xD;
50 "WHERE THE BEE -SUCKS THERE LURK I."&#xD;
melting nectar upon the table, neighbored by Car-&#xD;
lotta's wondful biscuits, wherewith we meant to&#xD;
delectate ourselves and our friends.&#xD;
We were never tired of watching their labors, and&#xD;
purchased "Bevan on the Bee" and divers authors&#xD;
on the same topic, and studied them sedulously;&#xD;
found out all the curious habits of the family of Apis,&#xD;
how they lick and otherwise train up their young&#xD;
Queens - as a mother puss does her kitten. Car-&#xD;
lotta said that if some queens we read about got;&#xD;
more lickings in their childhood, their subjects would&#xD;
have better times under their reigns, probably,&#xD;
Henry made an especial journey to Toptown, that he&#xD;
might order a copy- of the wonderful old Antwerp&#xD;
book, 1648, entitled the-" Spring of the Honey Fly,"&#xD;
and also the more venerable essay which is traced&#xD;
back to the age of Democritus, 46o years before&#xD;
Christ, called the "Portrait of the Honey Fly,"&#xD;
showing how bees are "bred from the purest juice ex-&#xD;
haled from flowers in summer," and describing the&#xD;
superior or King bee as springing from a blossom&#xD;
more noble than _common flowers, and also noticing&#xD;
the second king of a season, as a false king or truant,&#xD;
calling him the usurping prince who plays the flute&#xD;
to divert the bees; and before long Carlotta and&#xD;
Henry sided off into factions, one swearing by Huber&#xD;
and.the other quoting Huish, and after the fashion&#xD;
of all intense people riding hobbies, they..waxed&#xD;
warm in argument, and used more interjections than&#xD;
areadmissible in polite society.&#xD;
&#xD;
" WHERE THE BEE SUCKS THERE LURK       ." 5&#xD;
Carlotta also hunted up poetic scraps bearing upon&#xD;
her new fancy, and recited-&#xD;
"My banks they are'furnished with bees,&#xD;
Whose murmgs Wwite me to sleep."&#xD;
To wnich Henry added, How doth the little busy"&#xD;
-and we squinted a good deal under the corners&#xD;
of the hive, and through the glass windows, in&#xD;
hope to get a view of- the imperial majesty who&#xD;
queens it right royally over her subjects.&#xD;
It is true 'Carlotta sometimes scolded concerning&#xD;
the sad havoc these Hymenoptera made amongst&#xD;
her flower-pets, tearing the delicate blossoms quite&#xD;
to rags, opening prematurely the, rose-buds, pulling&#xD;
off the Turk's caps ; but Henry opened a discourse on&#xD;
a "garrulous Honey Eater," so named on account of&#xD;
its singularly talkative propensities, and remarked&#xD;
reflectively that it was really curious how well she&#xD;
answered its description. "The coloring of this bird&#xD;
is sober, but pleasing, the top of its head is black, the&#xD;
face dun, brown, and the eyes deep hazel."&#xD;
Carlotta replied that to'be a bee or not to be a&#xD;
bee was a question she should settle in her next&#xD;
metempsychosis, taking comfort in.the fact that it is&#xD;
the females alone who are able to sting their enemies:&#xD;
Our Hivites wre in the main good-natured. If&#xD;
we ventured "too lose, they would-dart .out with an&#xD;
admonitdry "phiz "-and sometimes Jim, our big&#xD;

through the door upon the floor, spitting and growl-&#xD;
ing over his shoulder at his winged pursuers, rolling&#xD;
over and over and pawing his ears; then we said&#xD;
quietly to-each other:&#xD;
"Poor Jim! the bees are after him."&#xD;
As midsummer approached, and the sun poured&#xD;
down hot and-hotter, and their corps of fanning-mills&#xD;
could not keep the hive cool, it became quite another&#xD;
affair; none of us could go near the hive, but half a&#xD;
score of angry workers of the "K.m. dm Ghallager "&#xD;
persuasion would pounce upon us, their stings in&#xD;
battle array ; evidently the mandate had been buzzed&#xD;
out by the licked Queen, "sting 'em-settle 'em "-and&#xD;
we learned to keep at a respectful distance from their&#xD;
quarter, in our walks around our half acre, and we&#xD;
much sympathized with the torments of the mis-&#xD;
guided cat, who could not leave them alone.&#xD;
One hot day in July-the hottest of the season-I&#xD;
was busily collecting the materials for building a&#xD;
double-decker apple-pie, and thinking of the cool&#xD;
spring where the Persian Prince filled his drinking-&#xD;
cup-in the leafy wood, and of the little ripples around&#xD;
the bank which musically kept time to the sportive&#xD;
splashes of "Nymphs bathing," in a picture I was&#xD;
fond of up at the Quince Bush, and wishing for a&#xD;
Russian ice-palace, or a little Esquimaux snow-hut,&#xD;
or--when Carlotta rushed in, trowel in hand;.and&#xD;
quiteout of breath.  ---&#xD;
"For gracious sake ! " she burst out, "do run!"&#xD;
"What is the matter? " I inquired, pushing the pie&#xD;
&#xD;
" WHERE THE BEE SUCKS THERE LURK 1." 53&#xD;
into the cupboard. "Is the toll-gate on fire, the&#xD;
canal running out, or is Mrs. Ramble coming to spend&#xD;
the day?"&#xD;
"Nothing of the sort!" she replied, gesticulating&#xD;
frantically, with the earth-stained implement she&#xD;
held ; "the bees are swarming!"&#xD;
"Oh, is that all; I am delighted. to hear it; I'll&#xD;
finish my double-decker and take a look at them."&#xD;
"But I tell you the ungrateful wretches, the&#xD;
Huishites, are making for the woods !-we are going&#xD;
to lose the whole posse, and their name is legion!" &#xD;
"No, no, that won't begin to do," said I, hurriedly&#xD;
restoring the much vexed pie to its seclusion ; " we&#xD;
must stop them ; we will distract them with discord-&#xD;
ant sounds, which they cannot bear ; hard noises&#xD;
mix their wits. That was not the original -reason,&#xD;
though, why tin pans were used in pursuing vagrant&#xD;
honey-flies-you see the Anglo-Saxons had a law&#xD;
that any person going ott of the highway into pri-&#xD;
vat. property without blowing a horn was liable to&#xD;
punishment, but as--"&#xD;
"Well, Serena, to hear you ambling on with your&#xD;
honey-flies .and horns, when the pestilent bees are&#xD;
making tracks, verily you let your moderation be&#xD;
known to all men."&#xD;
"I had to wash my hands of the double-decker;&#xD;
but I am through now." There they were, sure&#xD;
enough ! "thicker than the 'autumnal leaves which&#xD;
strew the brooks in Vallombrosa," and heading, as&#xD;
well as I could make out, for Gully Brook, and the&#xD;

dim wild-wood, as fast as their gauzy wings could&#xD;
carry them. So I ran out and hailed a promiscuous&#xD;
boy who happened to be looking over the garden&#xD;
fence close to the waxen lilies, so close, in fact, that&#xD;
one dirty paw was pushed through the pickets in the&#xD;
act of grasping the stalk of a fair  er. I promised&#xD;
him a basket of early apples, ditt of pears, and a fist-&#xD;
ful of roses, if he would run. u  to Henry's office&#xD;
with the important'intelligence. Then Carlotta and&#xD;
I armed ourselves with a great basin apiece, and an&#xD;
iron spoon, with which we outdid the gongs on a'&#xD;
Joss day, and gave chase to the recreant host. It&#xD;
became evident that the Queen was of the "new-de-&#xD;
parture " party, and was determined to found a king-&#xD;
dom of her own, all under the greenwood tree ; all-&#xD;
our drumming and shouting were of no avail. They&#xD;
soared al9ft, a solid phalanx of. buzzing wings; they&#xD;
would not be persuaded by otir musical performances;&#xD;
they were deaf to the voice of the charmers.&#xD;
Luckily, before we were quite' melted, Carlotta&#xD;
bethought herself to throw cold water on their plans,&#xD;
and she turned- the whole force of the hydraulic ram&#xD;
among them. This caused a panic, and. the Queen&#xD;
ordered a halt in a branch of an apple-tree to con-&#xD;
sider the situation. By the time Henry arrived they,&#xD;
were all there ; the branch was black with them,&#xD;
hanging, they only knew how, one, from another.&#xD;
We brought out our best hive, rubbed it well with&#xD;
sweet thyme, as Bevan advises insuch a case ; that is,&#xD;
I did it, while the Hubers and uishites were disput-&#xD;
uIhtswrelipt&#xD;

"WHERE -THE BEE SUCKS THERE LURK I." 55&#xD;
ing over the proper herb to use, one insisting on&#xD;
majoram, and the other asserting that sage was the&#xD;
only rubber. Our "patent glass ventilated" being&#xD;
duly placed on a table under the tree, the next step&#xD;
was to persuade the Hymenoptera to descend and&#xD;
take possession.&#xD;
" Now, .then,- Henry ! " said Carlotta, her arms&#xD;
akimbo, expectantly. "Now, then, run under and&#xD;
give them  a shake, and there we are all safe."&#xD;
" Hui-yes, all safe, of course, that is the proper&#xD;
course to take; but you see the rascals always sting a&#xD;
fellow without mercy," replied he, squinting doubt-&#xD;
fully up at the pendant kingdom. He had taken the&#xD;
precaution to protect his'face with a long green veil&#xD;
tied around the brim of his stove-pipe, and which&#xD;
draped fantastically about his masculine shoulders,&#xD;
ludicrously out of keeping with his office-coat, etc.,&#xD;
and had incased his hands in gloves. { Urged by the&#xD;
impatient Carlotta, he rushed desperately in, and giv-s&#xD;
ing the loaded limb a quick shiver, down they came,&#xD;
not as we hoped, in solid content, housed and homed&#xD;
in their .inverted hive;' but a buzzing, surging, an ry&#xD;
mass, "a gust of rugged wings," even to the middle&#xD;
bee, the centre -of the community. The outsiders&#xD;
quickly detached themselves, and gave us chase, with&#xD;
a suddenness and precision of purpose which fully&#xD;
avouched their resolution to do and die.&#xD;
Obeying Lady Macbeth's directions to her guests,&#xD;
e stayed not upon the order of our going we-went:&#xD;
at once, running like mad, fighting unseen foes,&#xD;

striking out blindly at our pursuers, dodging the&#xD;
smoke-house, circling round the hop-poles, like happy&#xD;
peasants on a May day:. Henry, leaving a keepsake&#xD;
of his green veil on every bush and twig which claim-&#xD;
ed such token, fill a greedy buck-thorn took ,the&#xD;
remainder,. hat and all included, leaving his head ex=&#xD;
posed to the enemy, and showing his eyes- in fine&#xD;
frenzy rolling. In and out, and around about, we&#xD;
fought and raced and plunged and scampered, taking&#xD;
refuge at last down cellar among the apple-bins and&#xD;
cider-barrels, and even there one or two followed us.&#xD;
Jim was close at our heels, green-eyed and enormous ;&#xD;
whether he believed us out on a midsummer-mad&#xD;
frolic, or appreciated the situation, he kept pace with&#xD;
our erratic flights, and jumped the last ditch-pork-&#xD;
barrel ahead of us all.&#xD;
We did not see each other clearly for many days,&#xD;
and disposed as soon as possible of our sticky pets to&#xD;
a bee-master, who could impunibly lift the wretches&#xD;
by the handful Huber and Huish were shelved, and&#xD;

VERYBODY is liable to change of opinions;&#xD;
and I have observed that where once a hobby&#xD;
has been trotted into a life, it is pretty sure&#xD;
to amble insinuatingly, back at intervals, although&#xD;
kicked out ever so ignominiously.&#xD;
Carjotta declared some while ago that she couldn't&#xD;
abide bees ; she would never again harbor the unpleas-&#xD;
ant, pilfering, vindictive wretches about the place ; but&#xD;
she was the very one to-propose restoring the hives.&#xD;
She said she missed the honey from her cakes, the&#xD;
spiced metheglin from her drinks, the wax front her&#xD;
stores. I privately. think she missed the pleasant&#xD;
occupation of watching the workers, and their- dron-&#xD;
ing sing-song from her-summer music; at any rate&#xD;
the reinstatement of the Apis family under our trees&#xD;
was a thing accomplished, through the medium of&#xD;
a newspaper, the very summer of Kitty Clayton's&#xD;
coming. Carlotta read one morning in a_" Courant,'&#xD;

LORD FEIGNING'S DAtIGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
which somehow found its way to our breakfast table,&#xD;
that a " small swarm of bees, enough for seed, was&#xD;
recently sent by mail from Lancaster.to Washington.&#xD;
The.means employed for their transit was a block of&#xD;
wood, about six inches in length, four inches wide and&#xD;
an inch and a quarter thick. Four holes, an inch in&#xD;
circumference, were bored through the block with ax&#xD;
auger, in each of which were confined a queen bee&#xD;
and half a dozen workers, the germ of a colony. Each&#xD;
end of the orifice was protected by a wire screen,&#xD;
affording ventilation; the postage amounted to&#xD;
twenty-one cents.  Instantly, Carlotta was fired&#xD;
with enthusiasm to get such a nucleus from Lancas-&#xD;
ter, and wrote that very day to Washington for infor-.&#xD;
mation. She got it ; and before we had really made&#xD;
up our minds to a repetition of our well-remembered,&#xD;
annoyances, behold Tommy Tiddler was at home&#xD;
once more, and Huber and Huish in full blast again.&#xD;
The auger-hole family was neighbored by half a dozen&#xD;
households in swinging hives, all as busy as bees.&#xD;
The tribe dwelling under the strawberry apple threat-&#xD;
ened to swarm, and, we were sitting with Kitty, as&#xD;
near as safe to them, armed with tin utensils and&#xD;
porridge sticks in order to anticipate .any disposition&#xD;
they might show pour prendre congs, when Henry&#xD;
came' quickly down the garden-path, his veil in one'&#xD;
hand, and an open letter in the other. I observed&#xD;
that the serenity of his usually benign countenance&#xD;
was somewhat clouded under a mist of perplexity.&#xD;
"Oh, by the way, girls," he commenced, apropos&#xD;
&#xD;
LORD FEIGNING'S -DA UGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
59-&#xD;
&#xD;
to nothing, and leaving, in the midst of a' bar, the&#xD;
doleful tune he was humming-he is always hum-&#xD;
ming a tune, and we discern his moods by the plain-&#xD;
tive or uproarious melodies he makes choice of-&#xD;
"oh, girls,- Belle Brandon is coming to make us that&#xD;
visit very soon."&#xD;
"Us!" exclaimed Carlotta; "speak for yourself,&#xD;
Mr. Gorton, if you please ; you invited 'her, and&#xD;
though I shall not follow the fashion of a lady I&#xD;
know, who locks up the' china and -stores when her&#xD;
husband has guests; and bids him entertain them as&#xD;
he can, I mean you shall have all the trouble as&#xD;
well as pleasure of'the job you have planned."&#xD;
4" Now, Carlotta, do not be unpleasant ; I wish&#xD;
you had a husband to keep you in order ; I could&#xD;
give him a few hints "-he went on pretending 'not&#xD;
to hear her running commentary, "Bachelors' wives,&#xD;
etc."-" No woman- should lock up my - china&#xD;
twice. I certainly shall do -my. best to make our&#xD;
pleasant old home agreeable to the coming lady. I&#xD;
can't make puddings and pies; I've got some prec-&#xD;
ious little women-folks. who excel in that vocation,&#xD;
fortunately. This girl comes of a good family-the&#xD;
Vernon Brandons, you know ; and she is an uncom-&#xD;

will find pleasurable, if you do not incase yourself in&#xD;

Although Henry replied quietly, I saw he was&#xD;
nettled at Carlotta's mischievous, unbelieving face;&#xD;
and I.would have made an effort to suppress herif I&#xD;
had not known, from long experience, that it was a&#xD;
thing impossible. If I ever trod on her toes, hoping&#xD;
to stop a speech, she would turn on me and say,&#xD;
"Now what do you mean, Serena, by stepping on&#xD;
my corns? You know quite well that I never learned&#xD;
the deaf and dumb language of the feet;" and so&#xD;
bring me to open confusion. And, therefore, I cut&#xD;
inrather uncivilly with a common-place remark&#xD;
"Quite true, Henry; as you say a remarkably&#xD;
i ce family. Three brothers came over with Wil-&#xD;
liam the Conqueror, and landed on Bunker Hill in&#xD;
the ' Mayflower,''where their descendants have lived&#xD;
ever since on the top of the Monument-taking care&#xD;
of the Beacon light-and I, for one, shall be im-&#xD;
mensely glad to see this merinber of it. I only hope&#xD;
she won't be a t1-ifle, just a trifle-a hint of a tint of.&#xD;
a shadow of a shade out of place amongst as unvar-&#xD;
nished folks."a&#xD;
I glanced somewhat ruefully up at'the old Red Cot-&#xD;
tage which snugged itself cosily enough, it is true,&#xD;
amongst its roses and posies and-greenery, but which&#xD;
was all corners and odds and ends, with its wood-&#xD;
house and well-house and dilapidated old barn,&#xD;
where the soft-soap was stowed away side by side&#xD;
with the garden-tools; and where Henry's Peckspif.&#xD;
ran costume fluttered from a ruty spike, agitated by&#xD;
each "wi'stlin wind,"&#xD;
&#xD;
"We can eat the stylish creature well enough, but&#xD;
the puzzle is, where we are to sleep lher,' said Car-&#xD;
lotta; "of course the arks she calls trunks will gorge&#xD;
the spare chamber, and certes she must abide among&#xD;
them, or share the pig-pen with Willie Winkie."&#xD;
"Most assuredly she, shall be put in the spare&#xD;
chamber; that point admits of no, discussion,", re-&#xD;
plied Henry, with extreme promptness.&#xD;
Now we have but two, guest places in the Red&#xD;
Cottage: one, of them small, low, plain, with furni-&#xD;
ture vhich has been there always ; the other, named&#xD;
"Blue Corner," a fanciful boutade of Henry's, and&#xD;
always devoted to his choicest friends. Of course,&#xD;
Kitty Clayton inhabited it at present, and her pretty&#xD;
belongings adorned it, and her dainty trifles scattered&#xD;
about it pleased me mor than the primrnest order.&#xD;
It is built in an odd angle,.finished quite up to the&#xD;
high-peaked roof, and the ceiling is curiously frescoed&#xD;
with, tropical flowers on a deep-blue ground. A&#xD;
little Egyptian lamp, which Henry broughtback&#xD;
whenhe let his beard grow, and went lotus-eating&#xD;
swings from an azure cord in the centre, where all&#xD;
the carved beams meet. In one corner stands a&#xD;
Pompeian brasier, which in summer serves as vase to&#xD;
great flower-bunches, and winter, for burnngthe&#xD;
odorous cones of the cucumber-tree, of whose sei&#xD;
perfume Carlotta.-is exceeding foid.  The narrow&#xD;
pointed windows are hung with blue damask_ and&#xD;
white lace; the carpet is a magical sprinklig ofpa&#xD;

dainty furniture of clear, curly maple, so finely, deli-&#xD;

ments have never desecrated its hallowed precincts;&#xD;

-delicious interior,&#xD;
Kittyhad listened to our debate with a in pan in&#xD;
her lap ready for action, in which Jim lay 'circularly&#xD;
icoled,, his Maltese tail softly waving, and his eyes&#xD;
blinking at the birds who were- restless fluttering in&#xD;
and out of their rustic habitation at the top of a hop&#xD;
pole hard by the smoke-house.&#xD;
"Dearest people," said she, "please tell me some-&#xD;
thing: who is Belle Brandon, and why do you make&#xD;
such a coil about her coming? I hope you did not sit&#xD;
in familycouncil over me in such a dreadful fashion.&#xD;
If I thought it, .I would want to go away directly."&#xD;
Indeed, but we did then," replied Carlotta quite&#xD;
candidly, "'and I assure you I much dreaded the in-.&#xD;
troduction.'of a boarding-school miss into our quiet&#xD;
house. Henry, it is true, painted the pretty child in&#xD;
glowing hues, but Henry sometimes blunders where&#xD;
Women are in question ; all is gold that glitters, to his&#xD;
eyes, as witness this. Saratoga belle of many seasons&#xD;
he is about to quarter upon us. There! don't curl&#xD;
your sweet lip, honey; You are my own darling, my&#xD;
comfort, my blessing. He did not blunder that once,'&#xD;
but wrought by inspiration thrice inspired."&#xD;
&#xD;
Carlotta punctuated each epithet with a kiss and a&#xD;
small hug. Kitty's face cleared, and she listened to&#xD;
the remainder of our confabulation in amused content.&#xD;
"You see, Kitty, Miss Brandon laid siege to- Hen-&#xD;
ricus last year at Niagara. I believe she confessed to&#xD;
a violent impulse to make-a headlong plunge into the&#xD;
seething current under Goat Island bridge, and was&#xD;
only restrained from the rash, fatal act by his strong,&#xD;
manly embrace, and her emotions, poetic, beautiful,&#xD;
interesting, culminated in a burst of tears on his&#xD;
shoulder."&#xD;
"Don't be absurd, Carlotta," cut in Henry in an an-&#xD;
noyed tone; "luckily we are ckez nous, or you might&#xD;
give me a reputation. You certainly earn one of dili-&#xD;
gent spinner of yarns."  Our gardener went easily&#xD;
n as though her talk had been continuous. "Yes,&#xD;
the dashing, stylish beauty fished for her man, like St.&#xD;
Peter; she. angled for an invitation here, ,though&#xD;
"hy she desires te bury her charms in this out of-the-&#xD;

Henry was bewitched, and behold the result! a fash-&#xD;
ionable woman, a hackneyed belle, domesticated in&#xD;
our old-fashioned corner, where she will be. as much&#xD;
in keeping as a bird of paradise in a hen-coop: all&#xD;
our independent ways must be infringed ; our privacy&#xD;
invaded; we must pick our words, mince, speak&#xD;
small, trim our motions to manner, be interviewed in&#xD;

I'd like uncommonly much to have her try it on; and&#xD;
who is to do the fancy cooking ? She sings, we are&#xD;
told-look out for squalls about these days; she sits&#xD;
up-late, of course. I shall shut the house at half-past&#xD;
nine, just as the clock strikes."&#xD;
Now look how Carlotta is putting herself in a&#xD;
nice preparatory fume. You may as well take pa-&#xD;
tience and, be good-tempered," replied Henry, with&#xD;
his usual mannish way of finishing a debate,. "She is&#xD;
coming anyhow. One swallow doesn't make a sum-&#xD;
mer, but, one will serve to gulp down your wrath.&#xD;
You will survive her visitamong other shocks of time,&#xD;
and if you approach the lady in a proper spirit you&#xD;
will find her a delightful companion. I assure you I&#xD;
did.":&#xD;
"Proper spirit!  interjected  Carlotta.  "Ap-&#xD;
proach the lady!"&#xD;
"By the foot of Plutarch ! there she blows !" ex-&#xD;
claimed our lawyer, beating out a ",rum te dum tidi&#xD;
dum" withhis tin pan and iron spoon, and printing&#xD;
to a dense body all wings and stings, which was gath-&#xD;
ering in the air above us. "Strike the cymbals,&#xD;
ladies, while I take the veil."  Nimbly darting hither&#xD;
and thither, we forgot the coming guest in the spirit&#xD;
and variety of his remarkable evolutions and the ab-&#xD;
sorbing interest of hiving our bees, which we accom-&#xD;
plished successfully.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;

IME is the nurse and breeder of all events,"&#xD;
and time brought forth the day of Belle&#xD;
Brandon's arrival. Carlotta and I had been&#xD;
stewing ourselves all the morning over the kitchen&#xD;
stove, getting up custards, tipsy cake, and other&#xD;
trifles. Kitty had picked and shelled the early tom-&#xD;
thumbs. Uenry had been diligently churning, his&#xD;
masculine proportions elegantly draped in a protect.&#xD;
ing table-cloth, and the never-failing old hat resting&#xD;
upon his curly pate ; and the longer he wielded the&#xD;
dasher, the more rakishly it tilted to one side, and&#xD;
the more ruefully discontented he looked. Our law-&#xD;
yer hated above all things to be asked to churn; anl&#xD;
though he rarely refused, he made our lives a bur&#xD;
den to us by constantly flapping up the lid to insect&#xD;
probabilities of coming butter, and spattering cream&#xD;

clots all over the place, glibly analyzing the lacteal&#xD;
fluid into 'its constituent elements, so that I was out,&#xD;
of conceit of the compound, hating to feel that I was&#xD;
dining and supping off salts and gases. ~The .wry&#xD;
faces he executed under our jokes were an honor to&#xD;
his head as well as his heart ; but his help was quite&#xD;
likely to be as much plague as profit, because he&#xD;
rarely had patience to await the consummation of his&#xD;
labor, and we were often obliged to drop whatever&#xD;
we had in .'hand and complete his unfinished job.&#xD;
/.As the tall kitchen clock struck elevenour dairyman&#xD;
'hastily cast off his disguise, as Achilles 'arose from&#xD;
spinning amongst the women with the first blast&#xD;
of Ulysses' trumpet; and wiping away theplen-&#xD;
tifu sprinkling of incipient butter from his cheeks&#xD;
and beard, he started to array himself for meeting&#xD;
the guest at the station.&#xD;
Look here! is that churning done? what o'clock.&#xD;
is it? " inquired Carlotta from the pantry, where she&#xD;
was up to her elbows in the fancy cooking shehad&#xD;
so solemnly abjured.&#xD;
"Bythe foot of Plutarch [Henry was fond of swear-&#xD;
ing;Bobadil's'favorite' oath]yIl see no reason why thou&#xD;
shouldst be so superfluousas to demand the time of&#xD;
ay; as to the game of rumble-de-thump I shall&#xD;
play it no longer; you must call in Winnie; I must&#xD;
away to youth and beauty and;jocund smiles"&#xD;
And, array edin his  attiest' hat and coat, al.d&#xD;
carying under his. arm the little }e he cut with hi&#xD;
owi jack-knife from the cedars'. of Lebanon, he&#xD;
&#xD;
whisked through the gate, and, sauntered up the&#xD;
plank-walk, drawing at his gloves, and h untming his&#xD;
gayest air. He had an uninvited companion' too, in&#xD;
his walk, because, the moment our Alderney heard&#xD;
the snap of the wicket, and discovered her master's&#xD;
voice discoursing mgsic, she trotted after him, beg-&#xD;
ging, with outstretched neck for the apple he was*&#xD;
accustomed to bestow. He took her attendance&#xD;
easily, being well used to it, till he met Bianca Ash-&#xD;
croft and Jerusha Peacock, who performed screams&#xD;
of terror at the idea of a little dun sea-cow onthe&#xD;
sidewalk; and he spoke so sternly to. his petted&#xD;
favorite, that she stopped short, casting reproachful&#xD;
glances from her Juno eyes, and finally wheeled&#xD;
about with a parting .loo, and reti'rned, her head&#xD;
lowered, brooding evidently upon the mutability of&#xD;
human friendships, and took her stand by the barn-&#xD;
door, chewing the cud'of sweet 'and bitter fancies.&#xD;
When the lumbering old stage stopped at our door,&#xD;
and Belle Brandon alighted politely assisted by&#xD;
Henry with the "very Jacob's staff of complimen,"&#xD;
her magnificent beauty, ripe as he.rvest, had a bewil-&#xD;
dering charm, which struckeven me, who am not&#xD;
easily impressed by flesh and blood perfections, and&#xD;
I fell to studying her blue eyes and blonde curls,&#xD;
noting how she coolly appropriated her escort'sat&#xD;

zeal nto the occupation if she had been furnished&#xD;
th a sufficient motive. Under. the present cireum-&#xD;

"The grass is damp, you darling little Phyllis; I&#xD;

me outdo you in country joys; but this evening, as&#xD;
yout will desert me, I'll run to my packing which&#xD;
your delightful talk has.made me forget.&#xD;
With a gushing kiss, she dismissed the good-na-&#xD;
tured Kitty, who flitted away, calling  mas se flew,&#xD;
and left the lady possessor of the Blue Corner.&#xD;
Abandoned to her own devices, that person took a&#xD;
thoughtful survey of the furniture, which she seemed&#xD;
to fid much to her taste. And she was fastidious in&#xD;
her surroundings, liking everything as elegant as&#xD;
possible, and what she liked she made it a p6int to&#xD;
get, if-managemernt and ingenuity could compass it.&#xD;
There was one little item which had eluded her ardent&#xD;
pursuit: she had failed to get a husband. She had.&#xD;
been very near, often, to wearing the plain gold ring;&#xD;
but somehow, even while she was reaching out her&#xD;
hand, ugly disappointments had arisen and pushed it&#xD;
aside. Miss Belle was an orphan indebted to an uncle&#xD;
for her 'brilliant education, Whose fashionable wife&#xD;
disliked her for her good looks, and yet more for her&#xD;
untoward behavior. She also made bitter moan at the&#xD;
expense of supporting her; and after being obliged&#xD;

to make 'the orphan feel so provokingly that she was&#xD;

but still she constantly saw plainer girls chosen; "two&#xD;
worgen were grinding in the mill, one was taken and&#xD;
the other left;" the, good chances slipped through her&#xD;
net, and, almost weary with angling, she found herself&#xD;
at 'twenty-seven an unclaimed-maiden still. And she&#xD;
aspitefully reflected that her beauty could-ot last for-&#xD;
ever, which galling -certainty rather took sweetness&#xD;
from1her naturally haughty, imperious disposition.&#xD;
Always having an eye to the main chance, and an-&#xD;
scrupulously using, everybody, made shprt friendships&#xD;

wmarth,' she rarely achieved a second invitation..&#xD;
Every One. of her honeyed words, every display of&#xD;
her pearly teeth; every toss of her blonde curls were&#xD;
meant to tell, and somehow people "got the hang of&#xD;
it," and'rit spoiled the effect. Though her coming to&#xD;
the Red Cottage was a resort dernier, now that she&#xD;
was there, housed with the pliable Kitty, who had&#xD;
the two things she lacked, a rich father -and no end&#xD;
in-money, she found profit front the monotonous&#xD;
seclusion; and dim visions already floated in hr&#xD;
scheming' brain of an establishment in New'Orleans&#xD;
to which our little pet rpiglit be the stepping-stone.&#xD;
the first essential to .her comfort was possession of&#xD;
the Blue Corner, which little nook was worthy of her&#xD;
warmest admiration,&#xD;
Perfectly ridiculous to waste such a bijou upon that&#xD;
unformed chit ! I should suppose it would be reserved&#xD;
for elegant guests; any place would suit her well&#xD;
enough, such a hoyden as she is! If anything should&#xD;

She turned away from the window, and ran her&#xD;
eyes, over the cabinet-pictures, medallions, thk small&#xD;
case of rare coins, the marble Stella on her pedestal&#xD;

of my eventful existence than all the old fogies in this&#xD;
God-forsaken corner ever thought of."&#xD;
While her thoughts were thus busy, Miss Brandon's,&#xD;
hands were not idle; she was turning over the con-&#xD;
tents of Kitty's bureau, and her blue eyes got bluer,&#xD;
examing'the fine laces, gloves, handkerchiefs, and&#xD;
kick-.knacks. She smelled-at the perfume boxes and&#xD;
scent bags, and critically pronounced upon a point-&#xD;
bertha in its dainty case, crossed and recrossed&#xD;
wthpink ribbons. In all her glory she had achieved&#xD;
nothinglike it; she had barely time to replace it in&#xD;
the drawer and busy her hands among her long curls,&#xD;
gazing innocently at them in the mirror, when Kitty&#xD;
rushed in, all flushed and rosy, and smelling de-&#xD;
cidedly of pig-weed.&#xD;
"You little breathless Hebe! you palpitating rose-&#xD;
bud! how this fresh country life suits you! I've&#xD;
been wasting my precious minutes watching your&#xD;
aerial flights and earthy gambols. I longed to de-&#xD;
scend and join them. I also can frolic. Ab I if I&#xD;
had but your robust health: I am delicate ;-I suffer&#xD;
terribly~tormenting headaches--I hope the room I&#xD;
am to occupy is quiet. I cannot bear any noise---&#xD;
last summer, Mr. Gossamer had sawdust spread&#xD;
above the gravel, about my windows. I sometimes&#xD;
really wonder why people are so fond of making me&#xD;
comfortable. Now sit down, cherie, and show me&#xD;
the pictures in this great album, and tell me who&#xD;
they may be."&#xD;
Kitty readily complied; first splashing her hot&#xD;
&#xD;
" YOURS TRULY, GEORGE BLAIR."&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
cheeks. with cool water, and stopping a moment to&#xD;
inspect and bewail a few unlucky grass-stains the&#xD;
India muslin had acquired ; with a brush or so, she&#xD;
dismissed them.&#xD;
"Carlotta knows how to take them all outs" said&#xD;
she, easily; "she's. got some stuff in a bottle that&#xD;
blanches everything like a charm."&#xD;
'I wonder .she does not try its magic on her nut-&#xD;
brown face," said Belle with a sraer. Though only&#xD;
a few hours in our little woman's society, she had&#xD;
conceived a violent dislike to her, acid I must ac-&#xD;
'knowledge there was small love lost. Seeing Kitty's&#xD;
displeased pout, she made haste to laugh and say,&#xD;
t Only a bit of my fun; no disrespect to Miss Carlotta,&#xD;
whom I sincerely admire.&#xD;
"'And well you may," said- Kitty ; "she's just as&#xD;
nice; she can scold a blue streak, though. When I.&#xD;
am twenty-five, I am going to keep house like her."&#xD;
Whatever gifts or acquirements the child had hidden,&#xD;
her expression was absolute simplicity. Early hours'&#xD;
and quiet living had kept her face childish and her&#xD;
frame vigorous, while a frequent change of school&#xD;
associates had made it easy for her to put out tendrils&#xD;
of love, and clasp' and entwine those who came&#xD;
naturally in her way. All her habits prepared her to&#xD;
become fond of Miss Brandon, her devoted, useful&#xD;
friend, and to get great content out of such a state of -&#xD;
being, while the lady-leader was kind. Henry said&#xD;

to it so easily. Sheexpressed nor felt any surprise-at&#xD;
finding the blonde in the Blue Corner, instead of the&#xD;
'spare room, busy among her trunks. In fact, she&#xD;
entirely forgot how that occupation had .been made&#xD;
the' excuse for remaining in-doors; and drawing her&#xD;
little easy chaiy close to the " perfection of comfort "&#xD;
in which her visitor was installed, she turned page&#xD;
after page-of the great album, and ran through the&#xD;
names, graces, virtues, etc., of the originals of the&#xD;
photographs, with an amusing volubility. Every&#xD;
one of "the- girls" -possessed some especial good&#xD;
gift: one was as "cunning as anything," another&#xD;
"just as e art as she could live," Cora Barker was&#xD;
"so hands e," Jenny Ashmead " full of fun," and&#xD;
"my dear oom-mate, Laura Gwin, the dearest, truest&#xD;
friend in the whole world."  No faults were chronicled,&#xD;
no mistakes mentioned.  Kitty's mind was of the&#xD;
type: which accretes no such rubbish; and while&#xD;
Belle listened with bland attention, waiting to achieve&#xD;
a piece of information, she observed this trait half&#xD;
curiously, half contemptuously.  Her patience was&#xD;
rewarded at length; when Kitty placed her small&#xD;
finger-tip upon a card, and said proudly:&#xD;
"This is my papa! isn't he beautiful ? "&#xD;
It was' the picture of a middle-aged man, partly,&#xD;
bald, and prematurely bowed; the' face was all lied&#xD;
with care-marks, the cheeks thin, and the lips show-&#xD;
ing 'their habitual compression, even beneath'their&#xD;
shadowing mustache ; 'the dress evinced a methodic&#xD;
habit of attention to trifles, and a great solitaire&#xD;
&#xD;
IU&#xD;
&#xD;
brilliant on the shirt-frill. had been touched up and'&#xD;
brought out with the artist's, choicest skill. Evi-&#xD;
dently, to his mind it was the cream of the whole&#xD;
performance.&#xD;
Belle studied it closely ; especially the diamond pin.&#xD;
"You are your father's own child, cherie," said she,&#xD;
smiling'; "you have his eyes-but of course it does&#xD;
not look that way to-you; you are not afraid of him.&#xD;
I think he looks a little stern, and hard to please.&#xD;
Is it not so?"&#xD;
Kitty cast down her eyes, and busied her fingers&#xD;
with undoing the spring of a locket she wore on her&#xD;
bosom. Belle's words echoed her secret thoughts,&#xD;
but she had. not got far enough in her confidence&#xD;
with her new friend to let out her private griefs, if&#xD;
she had any.&#xD;
"Nobody ever said Iwas stern and hard to please,&#xD;
so it can't be that expression I have inherited," she&#xD;
replied.  " This is papa in his youth, when his&#xD;
cheeks were red. I really do think I look a little&#xD;
like' this picture ; and this lady on the other side is&#xD;
my dear mamma."&#xD;
"Oh, indeed, how very pretty !" said Miss Bran-&#xD;
don ; and as she said so, she threw a glance into the&#xD;
mirror at her own superb loveliness: "not many&#xD;
women so beautiful as I am," she thought. "I&#xD;
must get things in train. ' In the morning sow thy&#xD;
seeds and in the evening withhold not thy hand,Jor&#xD;
thou knowest not' which shall prosper, whether this&#xD;
or that.'" Belle smiled inly at her sacrilegious apb&#xD;

have lighted at last upon what I need ; meanwhile let'&#xD;

really proves worth my while. If not--this Gorton&#xD;

Why stand we here idle,? what is it that gentlemen&#xD;
wish ! "&#xD;
While Kitty chatted merrily on, the worldly woman&#xD;
sat with her eyes upon the pictured faces which&#xD;
made the texts of the talk, and though she seemed to&#xD;
listen with pleased attention, her vagabond thoughts&#xD;
went rambling as we know-and they got busy&#xD;
among'some finished scenes of her life. There was a&#xD;
dark-browed Spaniard, whom she had held in thrall&#xD;
once, whose love-making had been a mixture of im-&#xD;
perfect English and very intense Castilian.  She&#xD;
seemed to feel his caress-his warm breath upon her&#xD;
cheek. There was no stain-on her ripe mouth, which&#xD;
looked dewy and fresh as a vestal virgin's, although&#xD;
she had been engaged a dozen times. Othello, you&#xD;
may remember, had a little private rumination in this&#xD;
same strain. " I°found not Cassio's kisses on her&#xD;
lips," said the fond old. Moor. The poor boy Zam-&#xD;
brano went to the, bad-thanks to her-and mixed&#xD;
with his memory came a idble face crowned with&#xD;
&#xD;
grizzled hair.  She had been very near marrying&#xD;
that man, and of all her lost chances this stung her&#xD;
most deeply-he was.so exhaustlessly rich.  The&#xD;
closing scene of that drama was mortifying, and al-&#xD;
though, seven years had passed since it swept her like&#xD;
a storm from her almost accomplished desires, it&#xD;
bitterly stung her yet, and she shut the golden clasps&#xD;
of the great volume with a quick snap, put away the&#xD;
young owner,- and rising, almost rudely, she shut&#xD;
herself into her chamber.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE LETTER AND THE PICTURE.&#xD;
ISS' BRANDON'S diligence and application,&#xD;
when she-had a scheme in hand, might have&#xD;
offered a bright example to many men of&#xD;
business. The next morning she proposed to Kitty&#xD;
that they should sit down together and get up their&#xD;
correspondence ; inviting her plumpness into the&#xD;
Blue Corner for that purpose, where she secured the&#xD;
"perfection of ,comfort," in the pleasantest angle,&#xD;
gaining a full-length view of herself in the long mir-&#xD;
ror.&#xD;
Kitty had no particular fondness for the occupa-&#xD;
tion, nor desire to pursue it at the moment, but&#xD;
Belle purred so insinuatingly that she consented,, and&#xD;
drew her chair to the opposite side of the table, and&#xD;
laid out her pretty French paper and her pens and&#xD;
her butterfly, and commenced: "My dearest papa,"&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
and then waited while the blonde got ready her,&#xD;
materials. The easiest portion of her epistle having&#xD;
been completed, and the rest being arduous labor,&#xD;
she was quite willing to delay and listen to the talk&#xD;
of her friend, who seemed in no haste, but went on&#xD;
turning out scraps of poetry, love letters, and billet-&#xD;
doux fromher portfolio, and commenting upon each&#xD;
till she carelessly tossed down before the child a&#xD;

"How do you like those frights ? are they ugly&#xD;
enough to be true ? " asked she, with a laugh.&#xD;
"'Oh, dear ! how perfectly lovely ! and just you-&#xD;
as'if you would speak ! I wish I could get  good&#xD;
ones of me. Papa didn't like the last I sent im; it&#xD;
did look funny-the horrid blue light hur my eyes&#xD;
and squinted them all out, and the sun blazed down&#xD;
so, I couldn't see the old head he stuck on a pole-&#xD;
and he would insist on my holding up my hand with&#xD;
a lump of my shawl clutched in it, and it looked a&#xD;
perfect paw-; Miss Teazle said it was good, and should&#xD;
go. Laura Gwin said she was hateful ; she made faces&#xD;
at her. And I knew papa would think me a fright-&#xD;
this is pretty, but you are pretty too."&#xD;
"Thank you, cherie ; I wonder if your father&#xD;
would be of the same opinion? I see you are&#xD;
writing first to him, like a dutiful daughter. Wouldn't.&#xD;
it be a frolic if you were to send him the shadow of&#xD;
your friend ? I wish you could also convey to him&#xD;
the pleasant impression his. charming little Kitty has&#xD;
made upon me ; but words.cannot do that!"&#xD;

&#xD;
The simple child flushed with pleasure. "How&#xD;
nice you are ! I should like ever so much to send&#xD;
this to papa ; and I must tell him all about you. ° I&#xD;
was wondering whatever I could put. into my letter.&#xD;
I- don't usually write but a page and.a half; but this&#xD;
time I have got something to say, and I mean to fill&#xD;
up the sheet."&#xD;
" That's right, cherie ; but if you intend giving a&#xD;
compendium of my character I shall bargain for a&#xD;
sight when finished."&#xD;
" Of course ; I don't need to tell about your face,&#xD;
because he will have that to look at, you know. He&#xD;
will think you very handsome. Why didn't you ever&#xD;
get married ?"-&#xD;
Belle smiled, and there came a very unpleasant&#xD;
glimmer through the deep blue of her eyes like burn-&#xD;
ing steel. Kitty so artlessly reminded her of the&#xD;
twenty-seven years, and that she considered her, if&#xD;
not passe, at least no more a young girl like herself.&#xD;
" Perhaps I may, some day, if I find a mran to suit&#xD;
me ; and cherie shall be my bridesmaid.  Come !&#xD;
we must begin to be industrious ; you have got no&#xD;
farther than 'Dearest Papa'--an excellent begin-&#xD;
fling; why don't you make him come on this summer&#xD;
and pay you a little visit ? If I had a good father I&#xD;
would make him stop with me altogether."&#xD;
".He would not like me to urge him, I am afraid;&#xD;
I never do; he is so busy, and hates the trouble of&#xD;
travelling."&#xD;
" I shall really begin to think you do not desire his&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
company ; and you his only daughter ! Perhaps he&#xD;
feels hurt that you do not beg of him to come, and&#xD;
would be glad to get a nice, loving letter from his&#xD;
little girl ; really, I must scold you !"&#xD;
"Well, if you think so, I will try. I never looked&#xD;
that way at it. You shall tell me a little what to&#xD;
write, and I will put it down  I do hate letters, it is&#xD;
so much nicer to look into people's eyes and talk ! "&#xD;
"Well, come! look straight into mine, Cherie !&#xD;
Now ifit was my father, I would say all sorts of fond&#xD;
things."&#xD;
Without exactly -dictating the epistle, Belle man-&#xD;
'aged to inspire the writer so that the missive dis-&#xD;
patched had certainly a new tone. It was full of&#xD;
pretty pleading and small nonsense ; and with the&#xD;
handsome woman's face .shut within, and a hearty&#xD;
eulogy upon that lady, it was sealed and addressed ;&#xD;
and then Miss Brandon seemed out of the humor of&#xD;
correspondence; for she declared herself tired, and&#xD;
threw up her arms and yawned, and proposed a walk&#xD;
to the post-office, where she kept careful watch of the&#xD;
missive till it was safely deposited in the care of good&#xD;
Uncle Sam.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
"DIES FASTUS."&#xD;
&#xD;
C&#xD;
&#xD;
ATURDAY in the country, and everything&#xD;
to do : sweeping, dusting, baking, brewing,&#xD;
boiling and stewing, besides cleaning up&#xD;
generally. I think the swift-rolling speed of' the&#xD;
days beats everything ; these dies fastus lap right&#xD;
together now; wr are not rested from the last till,&#xD;
behold! another is twirling away. I can remember&#xD;
when a week was a mentionable portion of time-not&#xD;
a flash.of the old mower's scythe ; heigho.! "All the&#xD;
labor- of a woman is for a man's mouth, and yet&#xD;
his appetite is not filled : " Ecclesiastes vi. 7. The.&#xD;
Red Cottage is a bit of a cottage, but it takes a mar-&#xD;
vellous deal of thinking and planning, to say nothing&#xD;
of hard work, to keep Henry's mouth full; and a&#xD;
great: many weary steps in the domestic treadmill to&#xD;
make the machine grind on steadily, so that there&#xD;
shall occur none of those ghastly hiatuses 'which&#xD;
pitch all comfort into chaos ; and I have known that&#xD;
&#xD;
wretched fellow to inquire in the most unfeeling&#xD;
manner, "Why, what. can you women-folks find to&#xD;
busy yourselves about ? " There was a time when I&#xD;
used to waste my breath in explaining some of the&#xD;
agreeable details of the menage, pointing out the&#xD;
motes in his sunbeams ; but I've got scornfully past&#xD;
all that; I pity his ignorance, and despise him.&#xD;
Saturday is, par excellence, our "working day ; "&#xD;
set apart exclusively to cleaning the engine, furbish-&#xD;
ing up the works, getting in fuel, and preparing for a&#xD;
fresh go ; though the process is wearing to bodies&#xD;
and souls, the emancipated condition of clean, easy&#xD;
quietude it brings out for the holy time approaching,&#xD;
is truly refreshing and delightsome.&#xD;
Henry is thankful in these seasons of hurry and&#xD;
worry for a "picked-up dinner ; " the bit of steak&#xD;
left from breakfast, eked out with a piece of apple-pie&#xD;
hot from the oven, and a cup of black tea, not set out&#xD;
with the mandarin china, but on an end of the great&#xD;
deal table, secure from the jostling of the workers ;&#xD;
a huge pan of doughnuts steaming under his "talented&#xD;
nose," defended by a great, brown cloth, which he&#xD;
modestly lifts and replaces with every fresh consump-&#xD;
tion ; the family bread, in process of rising, in a big&#xD;
wooden tray in the middle ; and the distant swishing&#xD;
of Winnie's scrubbing-brush mingling with the bub-&#xD;
bling and boiling on her kitchen stove. Winnie is the&#xD;
cleanest creature ; you, might eat your dinner off her&#xD;
floor ; and she has ways of disposing of her skirts&#xD;
which always remind me of&#xD;

"DIES FASTUS."&#xD;
&#xD;
Winifred Pice, who was tidy and clean,&#xD;
Her gown v+-s a flowered one, her petticoat green;&#xD;
Her buckles were bright as her milking cans,&#xD;
Her hair was brick-red, and cut like a man's.&#xD;
.Her little, gray eyes wei-e deep set in their socket-holes ;&#xD;
Her gown-tail was turned up, and tucked through the pocket-holes.&#xD;
A face like a ferret, betokened her spirit;&#xD;
To conclude, Mrs. Price was not over young,&#xD;
Had very short legs, and a very long tongue."&#xD;
If our factotum had sat foi' her portrait, she could&#xD;
not have been more aptly described ; and a more&#xD;
faithful, obliging soul, even in her tantrums, never&#xD;
wrought for Christians.&#xD;
Henry assimilates' his noonday repast on the dies&#xD;
fastus, I hope, with singleness of heart ; but not in-&#xD;
dulging in much light and cheerful conversation.&#xD;
Carlotta's replies are apt to be .a little more epigram..&#xD;
matic than usual; and even I, Serena, do sometimes,&#xD;
mislay my placidity of equilibrum, under the pressure&#xD;
of fighting circumstances. The man, of the house is&#xD;
wont to seize his hat and walk away quickly, humming-&#xD;
some plaintive ditty, and comforting himself with an&#xD;
apple or a bunch of raisins ; and he has great reason&#xD;
for thankfulness if he is not hollowed back just as he&#xD;
turns the corner, with the announcement that the&#xD;
molasses is out ; the oil jug    empty; or that some&#xD;
other of the multitudinous articles necessary to com-&#xD;
plete housekeeping are not, and must be replaced&#xD;
directly, or there will occur a general standstill.&#xD;
Jim keeps his distance from, the cottage on Satur-&#xD;
day, curling himself in the sweet-smelling hay in the&#xD;
&#xD;
"DIES FASTUS."&#xD;
&#xD;
95&#xD;
&#xD;
old barn, only sallying forth 'at distant intervals tp&#xD;
reconnoitre, and ascertain how soon he may reason-&#xD;
ably expect to be welcome within doors. He has&#xD;
learned to calculate chances equal to Hoyle; and&#xD;
when he hears the last splashes of Winnie's wash-&#xD;
house. inundation, and the flipping of her wet broom&#xD;
against the post, he knows that the cleaning is fin-&#xD;
ished, and the cat no longer in danger of being&#xD;
kicked out as a" nasty, pothrin' body, getting under&#xD;
foot," and he may safely resume the cushion of his&#xD;
favorite chair.&#xD;
No walks in the garden, no loitering admiration of&#xD;
flowers, no glee-singing or book-talks are in season.&#xD;
The flute stands idly in its corner. The old "Pleyel"&#xD;
is shut up ; my flageolet breathes not a strain. The&#xD;
sterner realities of the dins fastus crowd out all holiday&#xD;
indulgence, and still achieving, still pursuing-we&#xD;
learn to labor and to wait.&#xD;
On this particular Saturday we were unusually&#xD;
overwhelmed. Having dispatched the evening be-&#xD;
fore, per cars, an invoice of cousins, on the Norberry&#xD;
side, embracing almost as many children as that in-&#xD;
teresting household, whose history is feelingly set&#xD;
forth in the New England Primer, ''nine small chil-&#xD;
dren, and one out of breath," and we had barely&#xD;
time to take-a small dose of ''Nature's sweet restorer,&#xD;
balmy sleep," before the hurrying minutes pitched us&#xD;
right into the thick of our work. Orpha Ann Norberry&#xD;
had been billeted upon Kitty, who cuddled up to her&#xD;
and had a merry, good time, and Miss Brandon had&#xD;

been obliged to harbor Keziah, and the Red Cottage&#xD;
was in a state of irresponsible chaos. Though our ex-&#xD;
cellent kindred had tarried but a night, like respectable&#xD;
pilgrims, they had .caused a general uprooting of&#xD;
things, which neededpatience to lick into shape again.&#xD;
Especially the leavings of that scamp of a pestilent&#xD;
young Norberry, who played horse with everything&#xD;
movable, and left all our chairs tied together like&#xD;
prisoners of war, in whose midst he had fought an&#xD;
army, pelting them with the knick-knacks, shells,&#xD;
books, and other trifles he could lay hands on. While&#xD;
Aunt Melinda rejoiced in his sprightliness, and said&#xD;
he was "mamma's man if he broke everything all to&#xD;
bits."&#xD;
Miss Brandon complained of headache consequent&#xD;
upon broken rest, and was shut into the spare cham-&#xD;
ber, attended by willing Kitty, who had already run&#xD;
the value of half a dozen miles with ice-towels, hot&#xD;
tear and other remedies suited to. the case and occa-&#xD;
sion. I had tied up my hair in a red handkerchief&#xD;
that I might not feather out in process of sweeping,.&#xD;
and encased my digits-in a pair of Henry's old driv-&#xD;
ing gloves, minus a couple of fingers, and was skir-_&#xD;
mishing about, trying to get up the needful enthusiasm&#xD;
which avails to explore the corners and ferret out the&#xD;
tucking places-when somebody knocked. The door&#xD;
stood invitingly open, and the person seeking admit-&#xD;
tance seemed to think it unnecessary to wait a&#xD;
bidding .to enter ; for before I could get rid of my&#xD;
hand-shoes, or relieve my hair from its picturesque .&#xD;

adjustment, Mrs. -Ramble had entered and taken&#xD;
possession of the rocking-chair. Her bonnet, adorned&#xD;
with iron-gray everlastings of bristling horse-hair, as&#xD;
if her own grizzled locks had budded like Aaron's&#xD;
rod, was tilted back, and its crushed .and crumpled&#xD;
strings tied under her wrinkled chin, with marks of'&#xD;
haste, which I ascribed to a pressure of unshed :news&#xD;
on the dame's mind, of which I was certain to get the&#xD;
benefit.&#xD;
"Oh, Mrs. Ramble I good-morning. Busy as a&#xD;
bee you find us--Saturday is a trying epoch to house-&#xD;
wives, is it not?"&#xD;
" I don't make no such hidelo over it ; I don't see&#xD;
no use in scrubbing and rubbing every Saturday, I&#xD;
ain't going to stay a second hardly. IMrs. Toplofty's&#xD;
got her some new war-musses and a bunnet; he fetched&#xD;
'em from the city yesterday ; I thought I'd run down&#xD;
and see 'em. She's dreadful apt to dress too much&#xD;
for a church-member, and I feel as if I ought to use&#xD;
my influence,. and kinder lift up my voice ; last sum-&#xD;

as your arm ; company ain't gone yet, be they ?"&#xD;
"Yes ; they left us last evening."&#xD;
" What ! gone!   I thought they. was goin' to&#xD;

thought you referred to the Norberry's, who spent&#xD;
yesterday with us."&#xD;
"Law ! they been here and I didn't find it out !&#xD;
I'd a gin anything to see 'em. How's Moses gettin'&#xD;
along now? I heard he'd gin up preachin' and gone&#xD;
to York to be a cricket on a newspaper. Is it a&#xD;
fact ?"&#xD;
"Cousin Moses has taken an editor's chair there, I&#xD;
believe."&#xD;
" Ves--much the same thing, I s'pose-where's&#xD;
Carlotty?"&#xD;
"In the kitchen, Mrs. Ramble; this is baking&#xD;
day, and she is exceeding busy."&#xD;
" Oh, well, I ain't goin' to stay a second hardly ; I&#xD;
won't hinder her none. She needn't mind me."&#xD;
Seeing that she was determined to see the baker,,&#xD;
I opened the door, and there she stood beating eggs&#xD;
for dear life, and up to her elbows in flour, her&#xD;
face ornamented here and there with little white&#xD;
patches, showing well upon the clear brown ground,&#xD;
as I have seen ladies spinetimes who made too liberal&#xD;
use of meen 'fun or pearl powder. She intimated to&#xD;
me by sundry nods and becks not interspersed with&#xD;
wreathed smiles, that I was to shut the door directly,&#xD;
and say she couldn't and wouldn't come ; but as I&#xD;
knew Mrs. Ramble to be of a jealous turn of mind,&#xD;
and that she would be raspingly disagreeable to me&#xD;
in such a base, I expressed as much in pantomime as,&#xD;
animated as her own, the immediate vicinity of&#xD;
&#xD;
'D21 !S FAS277.",&#xD;
&#xD;
A9&#xD;
&#xD;
our visitor precluding the use of speech ; so she&#xD;
frowningly dropped, not to say dashed, down the&#xD;
egg-beater, and advanced to the door.&#xD;
" Oh, mornin', Carlotta ; I heard about your tiff&#xD;
with Mr. Squirmwell; you gin him fits, didn't you ?&#xD;
Well, I declare I was clean done out with that Jeru-&#xD;
sha Peacock last night at conference meetin', Ser-&#xD;
ena. You see, Deacon Rotterdam got up to make&#xD;
his speech, and just as soon as ever he' got to the&#xD;
place, 'When Skipio went into Africa,' she giggled&#xD;
right out, he stopped and gin her a look, and she&#xD;
kinder choked in as red as a beet ; but when he&#xD;
began again, 'When Skipio went into Africa,' away&#xD;
she went laffin' right out., And that warn't the worst&#xD;
don't: the girls all round her snickered, and the minis-&#xD;
ter had to hide up his face, and the deacon he sot&#xD;
down."&#xD;
Very wicked youths, Mrs. Ramble," remarked&#xD;
Carlotta.&#xD;
"'Yes, but the deacon says you smiled a contempt-&#xD;
able smile, and he is coming' down this afternoon to&#xD;
wait on you-he's gritty, I tell you."&#xD;
"You mean contemplative, don't you ? like this "-.&#xD;
drawing out her lips and eyes like a Chinaman.&#xD;
"You little midget, you ! If you don't look as&#xD;
wicked as a fox--better wink at him that 4way; he'd&#xD;
haf to laffi What's ye making' smells so good ? "&#xD;
Mrs. Ramble took a sniff, and advanced into our&#xD;
kitchen, undertaking a critical review of our resources&#xD;
and preparationrs for Sunday in the eating line.&#xD;

six dozen will do ; -I don't never have no luck,-and&#xD;
everybody says Carloty Gorton makes- the- best&#xD;
pickles they ever eat ; T must~ buy or borra some&#xD;
of 'em. My vines didn't seem to bear, and the vine-&#xD;

no vinegar no how, nothing but 'scorbutic acid, and I&#xD;
*kinder felt as if Serena 'd whack up a batch of tarts ;&#xD;
it's such an everlasting' job,'I hain't got no patience-to&#xD;
fiddle with the pesky things."&#xD;
I read a story when I was a child, something like&#xD;
this:&#xD;
&#xD;
a"I've broke your rotten old wheel-barrow usin'&#xD;
on't, and-I want you to get it mended, 'cause I want&#xD;
to borra it agin this arternoon."&#xD;
The owner of the dilapidated vehicle was a quiet&#xD;
Quaker, who calmly replied :&#xD;
" Friend ! it shall be repaired and sent to thee."&#xD;
It was'in this meek spirit that I promised cbmpli-&#xD;
ance with Mrs. Ramble's request. While she talked,&#xD;
Carlotta fidgeted about, holding up her doughy hands,&#xD;
till finally, losing all patience, she departed to her&#xD;
pantry, and left the~ whole task of entertaining to me,&#xD;
It was not an onerous one, so far as talking went, for&#xD;
having returned -to her rocking-chair, she treated me&#xD;
to a full and particular account of the quarrel over&#xD;
the new pew-cushions. How Mrs. .Squirmwell had&#xD;
taken away Mrs. Pillhackle's, and said she used to&#xD;
have it in the old -church for jen years, adding, " I de-&#xD;
clare, Serena, it must have wore like the Israelites'&#xD;
close in the wilderness, for 'tain't no ways ragged&#xD;
now." 'She dished up the deacons'and their wives,&#xD;
the minister and his family, in an original pot-pourri.&#xD;
Whenever I tried to insinuate a remark, she waved&#xD;
me off, holding all the while a pinch of snuff in her&#xD;
thumb and finger, and raising her voice a little louder,&#xD;
and pushed forward as volubly as ever.&#xD;
At length I took dexterous advantage of a pause sihe&#xD;
was forced to take, while she enjoyed her- macaboy,&#xD;
and slipped in a question by way of turning'the cur-&#xD;
rent of her thoughts.    gig&#xD;

will, and another'day he says he won't ; he keeps me&#xD;
as flipperty fussy as an old settin' hen that's had her&#xD;

Rising, Mrs. Ramble admitted herself to the apart-&#xD;
ment, without giving me- the trouble even to turn&#xD;
the knob for her, and going down on her knees, she&#xD;
proceeded to a careful. inspection of the fabric, in-&#xD;
quiring the price, if the thread and binding were&#xD;
thrown in., informing me that it was down crooked,&#xD;
and advising me to have it "took up and stretched&#xD;
right away,"&#xD;
Time never stays, and three mortal hours had drib-&#xD;
bled through the old hour-glass, while Mrs. Ramble&#xD;
knit and rocked, and yet she showed no "symp-&#xD;

commencing statement, " I' can't .stay a second&#xD;
hardly." Dinner-time drew on;. I thought, it would&#xD;
be hardly decent to allow the old -lady to depart,&#xD;
after so much exhausting discourse, unfed,. and I&#xD;
invited her to-stop and dine ; taking care, however, to&#xD;
forewarn her that she would not. be surfeited with&#xD;
&#xD;
a'&#xD;
&#xD;
good things ; as I might have foreseen, the dear old&#xD;
fish rose to the bait at once.&#xD;
"Well, I don't know but what I might as well,"&#xD;
said she, "as I've sot so long. Mr. Ramble can&#xD;
pick himself up a dinner somehow ; he's kinder used&#xD;
to a buttery-nibble, and don't mind style."&#xD;
Report said that the forbearing man usually got his&#xD;
own breakfast before going to his work in the: early&#xD;

slept, and not -unseldom his supper also, while she&#xD;
was attending all the prayer-meetings, societies, and&#xD;
mothers'-bands far and near.  Poor man ! though&#xD;
he drove his truck early and late, he-never seemed to&#xD;
drive it into much prosperity. There is a homely&#xD;
proverb: "a woman cani throw out with a teaspoon&#xD;
faster than a man can pour in with a shovel," which&#xD;
I am afraid had a bearing upon the Rambles' home.&#xD;
However, the knitter adjusted her spectacles, andher&#xD;
needle in its goose-quill sheath, and clicked away&#xD;
quite comfortably after having dismissed the respon-&#xD;
sibility of her good-man's dinner. Just as I was&#xD;
slipping out, thinking to. finish my sweeping before&#xD;
Henry's arrival, she arrested me by remarking:&#xD;
Have you heard how mean Alumzy Jane's hus-&#xD;
band treated her, just cause she bought a few things&#xD;
to the store, and had 'em charged without his know-&#xD;
ing it? Law! you'd a thought the sky was a failin',&#xD;
to hear him jaw, as if it wasn't a man's business to&#xD;
provide. What's the use of husbands if taintt to&#xD;

him a piece of my mind ; I'declare he ought to be&#xD;
hung on Haman's gallowses, but I tell you, Serena,&#xD;
the right sort of folks is as scarce as hens' teeth:."&#xD;
She was still agog with Alumzy Jane's wrongs&#xD;
when Henry arrived, but she faced about and in-&#xD;
terviewed him immediately.&#xD;
"Good-day, square ; I guess, as I'm here, I may&#xD;
as well get a little law; I 'spose, you don't charge&#xD;
nothing for advising' the ladies."&#xD;
I left her detailing a long affair about a pig which&#xD;
had come to a sad end, through malice prepense of&#xD;
some -marauding boys, and got the dinner on the&#xD;
table as fast as possible, but as I felt certain that&#xD;
Mrs. Ramble would never forgive me any sins of&#xD;
omission, though she lived in a most slip-shod way&#xD;
herself, I was obliged to lay the table in state.&#xD;
When Carlotta appeared all glowing and rosy with,&#xD;
working like a little beaver, I noticed the guest's eyes&#xD;
settle on her with an expression which boded some-&#xD;
thing disagreeable to be uttered presently (she has&#xD;
a knack at saying such things, and calls it "blunt&#xD;
frankness"), though she profited largely by her&#xD;
kitchen labors, eating voraciously of the juicy&#xD;
- broiled ham, fresh, warm apple-pie, and relishing&#xD;
little potato-balls, baked in cream, supping noisily&#xD;
the coffee-and if I do say it, you might go far to.&#xD;
find such pure, clear, amber-colored, aromatic coffee&#xD;
as we serve to ourselves and friends at-the Red Cot-&#xD;
tage.&#xD;
It was quite evident she had an affront to settle,&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
viz., the neglecting her presence for such a bagatelle&#xD;
as the Saturday's cooking.&#xD;
We have an old aunt in Bordentown, whom I am&#xD;
fond of visiting, and I can invariably tell the esti-&#xD;
mation in which she holds her guests by her way of&#xD;
entertaining. She says, " I always cook stuff for&#xD;
folks I don't care anything about ; but when I have&#xD;
real friends come, I- can't bear to leave them a min-&#xD;
ute." Carlotta is never taken aback ; her larder is.&#xD;
as sure to be full as a squirrel's-and visitors who&#xD;
drop in "are certain of nice food as well as piquant&#xD;
conversation."&#xD;
"Seems to me, Carlotta," began Mrs. Ramble,.&#xD;
squinting at the gold beads our little woman has&#xD;
never removed from her neck since they were clasped&#xD;
there by the poor blind mother-" seems to me you&#xD;
wear a great deal of gold for a chirch-member; I've&#xD;
heard folks say you was dreadful fond of dress."&#xD;
" Who are folks, most delightful generalizer?"&#xD;
demanded Carlotta, blandly.&#xD;
"Oh, I ain't going' to give no names, but I must&#xD;
say I wonder you don't have a ring in your nose too ;&#xD;
I think it would be just as. proper.&#xD;
"I am not given to rooting, and I don't need&#xD;
any-"&#xD;
"Well, you'd much better sell them tinkling or-&#xD;
naments, and give the money to the heathing. I&#xD;
wouldn't have the dingle-dangle things flopping&#xD;
round my ears; I wouldn't be seen with them."&#xD;

lady's snuff-stained nose, and wrinkled, weather-&#xD;
beaten, skinny neck. "No, Mrs. Ramble," said she,&#xD;
"neither would I-if I. were you."&#xD;
Well," replied the guest, tossing, the remains of&#xD;
her coffee about in her cup, preparatory to a finish&#xD;
of it--" well, they don't look Christian, nor becom-&#xD;
ing to Christian women. I've borne my testimony,.&#xD;
and that is all I can do. You don't seem very soci-&#xD;
able, square ! what's the matter?"&#xD;
" I agree with Varien, madam; people at dinner&#xD;
should be neither loquacious nor mute. Eloquence.&#xD;
is for the forum, silence for the bedchamber."&#xD;
" I want to know-don't you never think about get-&#xD;

"'Oh, yes, madam;&#xD;

"'Is that so ? You have a great flow of language ,&#xD;
when you do let it. out, haven't you,? Now, square,&#xD;
if I may make so bold, how old are you:.?"&#xD;
Henry, who has a- lawyer's horror of direct ques-&#xD;
tions, replied to: this home-thrust:&#xD;
"By the foot of Plutarch, I was so very young:&#xD;
when I was born: that I don't thi k I caught the&#xD;
exact date, even if I heard it mentio ed, which is not.&#xD;
likely. Now, Mrs. Ramble, I'll ask you a question:&#xD;
what is the first mention of bitters in the Bible?"&#xD;
"I don't know,.sqttare; I don't believe in such rid.&#xD;
&#xD;
DIES FASTUS."             tO7&#xD;
dies, making fun of Holy Writ: but what is it? I'm&#xD;
kinder curus to hear."&#xD;
"The waters of Marah, which were bitter, weren't&#xD;
they ?&#xD;
"That's so, square ; bitter? yes, as true as you&#xD;
live; but the folks grumbled at themer e&#xD;
"Yes, ,I know they did, until they were sweetened;&#xD;
same way with us, we use sugar with ours."&#xD;
"Now,-square, I declare you are too bad-'cute,&#xD;
though, ain't it."&#xD;
Belle Brandon, meanwhile, had not been idle; with&#xD;
Kitty ministering to her, she had done a good deal&#xD;
of moaning and groaning.&#xD;
",Oh, dear, my head! how it aches; I know it was&#xD;
the dumplings and cream yesterday. I never could&#xD;
eat such stuff."&#xD;
"Stuff! " echoed litty; "they were elegant, as&#xD;
light and nice as puffs ; my head doesn't ache, and I&#xD;
ate ever so much."&#xD;
"You have such robust health, child, you might&#xD;
eat nails like a camel."&#xD;
"Well, I, like that, Belle, when I saw you swallow&#xD;
a whole lemon last night."&#xD;
"That was a tonic, Cherie. It may have been the&#xD;
dreadful cousin who made me ill, she talked such&#xD;
fearful twaddle."&#xD;
"Orpha Ann and I had a joyous time, though ;&#xD;
we fold fairy stories," answered Kitty, laughing&#xD;
"Sweet innocent, you have the very nature tobe&#xD;
pleased with a rattle and tickled with a straw. Ah .&#xD;

there goes another wagon ! it seems as if they all,&#xD;
rolled on the top of my head. If this room was only&#xD;
as, nice and quiet as yours--the horrid old plank-&#xD;
road gives me agonies ; I know just how much toll&#xD;
that lame wretch took last night ; I heard him&#xD;
count it. You ought to be thankful to be out of&#xD;
the sound of it; but you can sleep anywhere': I wish&#xD;
I could."&#xD;
Kitty reproached herself that she had not thought&#xD;
of offering the invalid her Blue Corner, so cool and&#xD;
still, and made haste to insist on immediate transfer,&#xD;
wet towels, ice-water, and all; and being dismissed by&#xD;
the i ew incumbent, who languidly hoped she could&#xD;
sleep-she came down rosy and satisfied, just as Mrs.&#xD;
Ramble had swallowed the last crumb of her dinner&#xD;
and put her last question to the lawyer.&#xD;
"Well, I declare fort, I must eat and run as the&#xD;
beggars do, or I shan't make out to get a sight of&#xD;
Mrs. Toplofty's warmusses; here comes Kitty-.do&#xD;
you know what my old father used to say to me ? he&#xD;
used to say, ' Late to breakfast, late to heaven;' and&#xD;
that makes me think, what would you answer if I was&#xD;
to tell you how Mrs. Squirmwell allows that you down&#xD;
here, are pretty likely to walk into conference after&#xD;

"I should call her a frisky Sapphira, Mrs. Ram-&#xD;

"Pretty good, square ; I s'pose you know she had&#xD;

where's Miss Brandon? does she have her vituals&#xD;

"She's got a headache. I just left her in iny room;&#xD;

"In your room, Kitty! what's that for?"&#xD;
"The rolling of the carts and things hurt her head ;&#xD;
my dear Blue Corner is the quietest nook, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
The shrewd old woman looked sharply at the child :&#xD;
"You didn't ought. to let her in there, Kitty," said&#xD;
she. " It won't be easy to get her out again, I can&#xD;
tell you-don't you let the sun go down on her, the&#xD;
'cute old one ! I can see through a grin-stone when&#xD;
there's a hole in it."&#xD;
"Cow-bird," muttered Carlotta; "Pestilent Frin-&#xD;
gilla."&#xD;
"Now, then, Carlie," laughed Henry, "unclasp the'&#xD;
purple leaves of war." Seeing that Mrs. Ramble was&#xD;
sagaciously observant of us all, we, with one consent,&#xD;
ceased all conference upon our private affairs, and&#xD;
she left us to inspect Mrs. Toplofty's new warm-&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
WERE YOU NEVER IN :LOVE, CARLOTTA.?&#xD;
HE sociable young people of Merry Bank,&#xD;
with' whom Kitty was an. immense favorite,&#xD;
called upon Miss Brandon, who impressed&#xD;
themall more or less' by her elegant dresses, and air of&#xD;
fashion andstyle. Picnics and sociables were the order&#xD;
of the' day, and'though the blonde often ridiculed-her&#xD;
hospitable entertainers, she accepted  their invitations,&#xD;
arid when she felt in humor, or saw anything to be&#xD;
gained, she knew how to suit herself to any set of&#xD;
tastes or circumstances. She speedily ascertained to&#xD;
her satisfaction the status of every prominent family&#xD;
in town, and the prospects, matrimonial or otherwise,&#xD;
which the place afforded. She singled out for a&#xD;
particular display of the shoulders and dimples, a&#xD;
middle-aged, almost elderly banker, who-had recently&#xD;
come among us, of whom little good was known.&#xD;
He was a returned Californian, and was reputed ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
WERE YO( NVER IN LovE, CARLOTTA?      11&#xD;
haustlessly rich ; but.whether heobtained his wealth&#xD;
in honest digging, r skilful shuffling of the " devil's&#xD;
leaves," was not clearly understood. Of course all&#xD;
sorts of tales wer rife, all or none of which might&#xD;
be true;-. He wa  a widower, twice bereaved, ex-&#xD;
tremely fond of horses, of which he drove the showi-&#xD;
est, an excellent' judge of female beauty, and had a&#xD;
brotherly, fatherly, protective, friendly way of address&#xD;
ing women, which, with his, lavish use of money,&#xD;
good-natured proffers of his spanking grays, high&#xD;
bred saddle-horses, and his ready willingness to pro-&#xD;
mote any frolic, or merry-making, glossed over his&#xD;
sporting talk, his frontier coarseness: and swagger,&#xD;
and gained him favor in houses from which poor,&#xD;
seedy blacklegs would' have been ignominiously&#xD;
ejected. His face told a tale of him, which our friend&#xD;
Chaidy Goldsmith used to put in' the form of a conune-&#xD;
drum, "Who hath redness of eyes-? he that tarrieth"&#xD;
long at the wine.&#xD;
The fact that Mr. John Nickson had shown marked&#xD;
admiration of Kitty Clayton's sweet ways; and' fresh,&#xD;
young: face, added zest to tell's secret exultation'&#xD;
that she could draw him''to her side, by one melting&#xD;
glance of her steely blue eyes, one witching display&#xD;
of the matchless dimples, and who can blame her for&#xD;
a little ill-nature, when Kittyso' artlessly expressed&#xD;
her joy to be rid of' him and his attentions ? While&#xD;
keeping another project in mind, Miss Brandon' be-&#xD;
gan to revolve seriously 'the question whether it would&#xD;
not be for her advantage to fold her' tired wings, a&#xD;

domestic dove, in Mr. Nickson's experienced bosom,&#xD;
and ceasing her wandering quest on restless pinions&#xD;
roaming, to bestow the much-hawked-about shoul-&#xD;
ders, the often-tossed blonde curls, and what battered&#xD;
-remains of a heart she could patch together, upon&#xD;
the banker, as soon a§ he could be brought to begfor&#xD;
them, which sweet pleading she had many minds to&#xD;
hasten to a climax. She had already discerned the&#xD;
faintest outline of an incipient crow's-foot under her&#xD;
left eye, and a couple of freckles'on her nose. Death&#xD;
gave three warnings to his victim before he took him&#xD;
into custody; .Belle felt that she had got two-that&#xD;
there was no time to lose before entering the holy&#xD;
estate of wedlock.&#xD;
Kitty daily expected a reply to her letter contain-&#xD;
ing the pictured beauty, and was fond of talking about&#xD;
it and the surprise such an inclosure must have been&#xD;
to her dear papa, and discussing the probabNities of&#xD;
his coming ; Belle also looked out anxiously ; it might&#xD;
change her plans:&#xD;
It was the second week, I think, after her arrival at&#xD;
the Red Cottage, that Carlotta one morning discov-&#xD;
ered Kitty sitting quite disconsolate in a huddled at-&#xD;
titude, looking out of the window, over the tops of&#xD;
the flowers, without seeing anything.&#xD;
"Why, pet ! what's gone cris-cross -? has Jim for-&#xD;
sakedi his little mistress ? have the ducks forgot to&#xD;
quack ? has the cow-bird been unpleasant, that you&#xD;
hang metaphorically your harp upon the willow and&#xD;
~abandon yourself to desolation, your head bowed&#xD;
&#xD;
WERE YOU NEVER IN LOVE, CARLOTTA? 113&#xD;
down like a bulrush? Come here till I hold you a&#xD;
little, and you whisper your woes into my ear.&#xD;
"Oh, there's nothing the matter, Carlie; only I was&#xD;
thinking," replied Kitty from her favorite resting-&#xD;
place on her friend's breast. She had a pleasant, cud-&#xD;
dling little way like a soft kitten, which made. cares-&#xD;
ses the most natural thing to bestow and .receive.&#xD;
Nothing in the world, but I should like to ask you&#xD;
one question."&#xD;
"Well, sweet, what is it?"&#xD;
"Were you never in love, Carlotta?"&#xD;
"Oh, yesI" replied the woman-friend quietly,&#xD;
though her pulse  sickened, and her black eyes emit-&#xD;
ted an unconscious flash ; " oh, yes, of course ; I am&#xD;
twenty-five years old, and I don't suppose you could&#xD;
find many females of that ripeness who have not been&#xD;
silly over some fool or other."&#xD;
Tell me about it," said Kitty, nestling closer.&#xD;
There isn't much to tell, pet;- I wasn't crossed in&#xD;
love: Iwas onlyseparated from the young person."&#xD;
"But he made you an offer of marriage; he was a&#xD;
real lover.&#xD;
"Oh yes, he did--I suppose he loved me i a way&#xD;
-as much as could be expected. It wasn't that he&#xD;
loved Caesar less, but Rome more."&#xD;
"What do you mean ? who was Caesar?&#xD;
" Only 'an old Roman, much used for pointing a&#xD;
moral."&#xD;
" Oh, something out of a book. But, Carlie, did&#xD;
his hair curl?&#xD;

114 .WERE YOU NEVER IN LOVE, CARLOTTA?&#xD;
"Let me consider-to the best of my recollection,&#xD;
it did."&#xD;
"That was right ; what became of him ?"&#xD;
" He took a voyage to China."&#xD;
"And never came'back, nor sent you any word?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, he wrote to ie for a twelvemonth or&#xD;
so, and sent me a lot of rubbish, which I've got&#xD;
tucked away upstairs somewhere."&#xD;
"Well, Carlotta, please go on; I want to hear all,&#xD;
about it ; what did he say ? how did he act?"&#xD;
"He talked nonsense, acted like a fool ; he under-&#xD;
took to lecture me ! to tell me what he expected in&#xD;
his wife, and all that, and I just cut him short-told&#xD;
him it was evident we were not intended for each&#xD;
other, and if he was so positive about the pattern&#xD;
he meant to cut his wife to, he had better look&#xD;
elsewhere, because I had no idea of being trimmed&#xD;
and fashioned out of my individuality to suit any-&#xD;
body."&#xD;
"Why, Carlie, how could you ? wasn't you afraid&#xD;
of making him angry ?"&#xD;
"Afraid ! no, child-I have yet to see the person I&#xD;
am afraid of-I told hin the truth. I meant to. I&#xD;
had one more letter,, dated Siam; he said he had&#xD;
burned all my former epistles, but would keep that&#xD;
one to discuss in full when he came home."&#xD;
.Anddid hekep it ?"&#xD;
"I don't know, child, nor care; he hasn't come&#xD;
home yet; he went for three years, and tiey are not&#xD;
up till July. I don't know anything about the arro-&#xD;
&#xD;
WERE YOUV NEVAR IN LOVE, CARLOTTA? 1ir&#xD;
gant pest. I never trouble my head about him-any&#xD;
to speak of."&#xD;
" But you have not forgotten him; I see that in&#xD;
your eyes ; they glimmer and glisten ; when he&#xD;
returns he will come here. I hope I shall see him."&#xD;
"Pho! child; he will be mighty shy of hunting me&#xD;
out. I am too sharp for a comfortable sweetheart.&#xD;
I must say my say."&#xD;
"Oh yes, he will come, Carlotta, and you will&#xD;
make up, and be married, and I will see you; I wish&#xD;
it was July now."&#xD;
"Silly Kitty ; but what has all this trumpery to do&#xD;
with my pet's pensiveness, when I found her like&#xD;
Cathleen O'Moore, who sat in the door one cold&#xD;
afternoon, to hear the wind blow and to look at the&#xD;
moon."&#xD;
"Well, I'll tell you-I don't see why I don't have&#xD;
any lovers ; I'm not so very ugly, am I? Belle has had&#xD;
cords and cords of them; she's got a book where she&#xD;
keeps a list of her offers-=I want -to have one."&#xD;
" What, an offer-book ! so you shall; we'll go up'&#xD;
town and buy a beauty, all bound in blue and gold,&#xD;
and I'll sharpen you a canary quill to write down the&#xD;
first one ; let's see, who shall it be ?-there's--Bascom&#xD;
Peacock ; but no:: his hair is too straight ; come, get&#xD;
your hat and we'll hunt the volume first."&#xD;
"No, no, I don't want that; I want a real lover,&#xD;
such as you had."&#xD;
"Such.as. I had-Heaven forbid! you are quite&#xD;
too nice to be toned down aid primmed up; oh you&#xD;

116 WERE YOU NEVER IN LOVE, CARL7OTTA ?&#xD;
simple little fresh rose-bud ! a lover! you are crying&#xD;
for a lover, as the baby cried for the moon ; come,&#xD;
moony ! moony ! come, lovery, lovery ! "&#xD;
"I don't a bit care if you do make fun of me;&#xD;
Belle is so unpleasant about it, all the time vaunting&#xD;
herself; it seems as if I was no account, and truly,&#xD;
Carlie, it must be ever so nice--a proud, handsome&#xD;
fellow, with friendly eyes and curly hair, thinking&#xD;
about one all the while-just devoted, you know."&#xD;
''"You will sample the pleasantness all in good&#xD;
time, Pet; don't let that cow-bird fill your innocent&#xD;
noddle with her unwomanly ambitions. When you do&#xD;
acquire a lover I hope he will make a husband; and&#xD;
that is what Belle has not, found for all her offer-&#xD;
book. By the way, Kitty, you promised to take&#xD;
possession of the Blue Corner this week ; I shall have&#xD;
to interfere if you don't hold to your mind ; I would&#xD;
have done so long ago if you had not begged me&#xD;
with-tears in your eyes to keep quiet."&#xD;
"Oh Carlotta, don't make a fuss, please; Belle will&#xD;
be angry ; I don't mind; I like the spare chamber&#xD;
just as well-no, not quite so well, but I am comfort-&#xD;
able enough there, and I can't bear to hurt her feel-&#xD;
ings. She is accustomed to nice things, and you know&#xD;
our rooms at school were just as plain as they could&#xD;
be, so I haven't got what she calls ' Luxurious&#xD;
habits.'"&#xD;
"Luxurious habits !' I'll put an end to that trash,&#xD;
she shall march this very day.,"&#xD;
"But, Carlotta, I don't see how you can help&#xD;

yourself now, because," said. Kitty,'hesitating and&#xD;
blushing, "she has moved all my clothes and things&#xD;
and put hers up for good."&#xD;
"What! and you let her ! Why didn't you call&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
" You weren'tA1ere, dear woman-friend. It was&#xD;
yesterday, when you were all at the flower-show. I&#xD;
couldn't say a word, it seemed so selfish of me ; and&#xD;
she was very pleasant about it-really funny. I had&#xD;
a good laugh, and she danced a hornpipe--tihe pret'&#xD;
tiest you ever saw-and whistled the tune.' I must&#xD;
say I felt a little bad, because Henry put me in there,&#xD;
and said it was my fairy bower. Do you mind the&#xD;
poem he recited, and the ridiculous gestures ?&#xD;
Kitty laughed at the recollection, and left her place&#xD;
to rehearse the scene from memory ; and Carlotta,&#xD;
looking at her, muttered,&#xD;
Nasty cow-bird ! I hope Henry will get enough&#xD;
of Lord Feigning's daughter when he has finished this&#xD;
episode."&#xD;
Of course there was nothing to be done without&#xD;
having what our lawyer calls a." row," of which he&#xD;
has a devout horror ; though we discussed the topic&#xD;
at large downstairs, and he hummed his dolefullest&#xD;
tune, while he listened and ejaculated," By the foot&#xD;
of Plutarch;" and he commenced a fresh ditty of the&#xD;
most bewailing minorness, when the beautiful blonde&#xD;
descended to supper, with her creamy arm around&#xD;
her dupe's neck, and her melodious laugh musically&#xD;
dropping upon our ears. Floating up to Carlotta,&#xD;

she offered a gushing hug, and she was not a whit&#xD;
abashed when she got the cut direct.&#xD;
"Why are you so brash, beauty ? " said she.&#xD;
"There is a time to embrace."&#xD;
"And also a time to refrain from embracing," re-&#xD;
plied Carlotta, curtly; "and this is the exact period&#xD;
spoken of."&#xD;
Henry rushed desperately out, and presently re-&#xD;
turned in the last strain of his doleful utterance,&#xD;
holding out some lovely scarlet strawberries of a new&#xD;

NE fine day, the two girls, in their cool mus-&#xD;
lins, strolled up to Lamode's shop to look at&#xD;
worsteds. At the door Mr. -Nickson met&#xD;
them, and preferred a request that the young ladies,&#xD;
including both, but fixing his eyes upon Miss Bran-&#xD;
don, would drive out with him in the cool of the&#xD;
evening to Sandy Creek-a famous country resort on&#xD;
the old ridge road. Kitty declined, pleading an en-&#xD;
gagement with Henry, viz.: "the chores.'' Belle&#xD;
loftily accepted.&#xD;
The shopkeeper, who had been standing  behind&#xD;
his counter with an air of deferential waiting, while the&#xD;
gentleman completed his little arrangement and.bowed&#xD;
himself off,'now brought forth a handkerchief, tempt-&#xD;
ingly displayed in a highly ornamented box) on the&#xD;
cover of which a young female in high and low 4nc-&#xD;

ing costume, with flaming cheeks and captivating&#xD;
smile, was performing a pas-seal in the presence of a&#xD;
fountain.&#xD;
Holding up the airy fabric, she stuck her head,&#xD;
adorned with a false front and horn side-combs, on&#xD;
one side, and shut up one eye tight while she fas-&#xD;
tened the other ecstatically upon the bit of goods she&#xD;
meant to sell.&#xD;
"Did you ever see anything, ladies, so beautiful as,&#xD;
that ? It isn't often I venture to bring -such costly&#xD;
things here to Merry Bank, .there are so few ladies&#xD;
willing to pay for them ; but directly I saw this lovely&#xD;
handkerchief (I gotihome from Toptown last night),&#xD;
I said to Miss Snuffandbark, I'm just going to-show&#xD;
that to Miss Brandon; she is a real judge, and I do&#xD;
enjoy having such ladies look at my goods-we don't&#xD;
ask anything for showing our laces-and the very first&#xD;
time she ever set foot in my store, I said, says I, there&#xD;
is a lady that knows the worth of laces. Now do you&#xD;
drop everything and wait on that lady whenever she&#xD;
comes in. Those are the very words I spoke. Isn't&#xD;
it a beauty ! real lace, .1d so cheap. -There, Miss&#xD;
Kitty, a little bird whispered in my ear there's to be&#xD;
a grand party in town soon. If you take this I can&#xD;
duplicate it in a day and a half. There's just one&#xD;
more like it. I don't mention any names, but it's&#xD;
so.&#xD;
o" How much is it ?" inquired-Belle, coolly, not in&#xD;
the least moved by all the shop-talk, while Kitty felt&#xD;
uncomfortable, and as if she ought to purchase at&#xD;
&#xD;
THEY THAT GO BORROWING, GO SQRROWING. 121&#xD;
once, or at any rate double her worsted order, and&#xD;
try to think of something else she needed.&#xD;
"Only fifty dollars. It couldn't be imported for&#xD;
seventy-five now; and such a lovely pattern. And&#xD;
I've some point collars for you. Just your style--so&#xD;
delicate and genteel."&#xD;
"Oh, thank you ; I never wear those things," re-&#xD;
plied Kitty, feeling that she would have to buy if&#xD;
urged. " Madame Devereaux:does not permit us."&#xD;
Belle made a side griniace as the. 'voluble shop-&#xD;
woman, mounted some steps to fetch down a box&#xD;
from a high shelf. "The mouchoir is a pretty thing&#xD;
eough, and not dear either; smuggled, probably.&#xD;
I' certainly have it if I had my quarter; unlucky,&#xD;
that I am impecunious, isn't it ? I might display it&#xD;
this evening with a killing flourish to Mr. Nickson's&#xD;
admiring gaze. I dare say he is as good a judgeof&#xD;
laces as of horse-flesh and women."  Belle Brandon&#xD;
was a handsome person, but she did not look lovely&#xD;
with such a bitter, haughty, soulless sneer on her red&#xD;
lip.&#xD;
Kitty laughed. "Oh, don't mind the money,&#xD;
Belle, said she, easily, "I have plenty.&#xD;
"Thank you, Mignonne ; but I couldn't think of&#xD;
borrowing,"-...which seemed airather remarkable an.&#xD;
announcement, considering her. usualfashion of supply&#xD;
ing her needs.  After a little pressing on Kitty's&#xD;
part, and pretended reluctance on hersshenali&#xD;
consented to accept-a loan.&#xD;

'I mean to keep it good,". spoke up Kitty with a&#xD;
decision quite noticeable in her. 'I never made a&#xD;
bill in my life, and I should not know how to begin&#xD;
now."&#xD;
The shopkeeper replaced the laces without another&#xD;
word, and Belle carried off the coveted bit of gossa-&#xD;
mer, in a high state of satisfaction, after some little&#xD;
time spent in matching the-worsteds for the smoking-&#xD;
cap of wondrous pattern which ,Kitty was working&#xD;
for Henry, and which took all her remaining silver,&#xD;
and the dog's-head slippers which Belle had' com-&#xD;
menced for a party unknown. The blonde was in an&#xD;
expansive humor walking homeward, and Kitty&#xD;
pleased and happy, though her little purse was quite&#xD;
empty ; and. after they were out of ear-shot, Lamode&#xD;
said in confidence to Miss Snuffandbark, "I'll give&#xD;
you my opinion of that girl, free, gratis, for nothing.;&#xD;
I won't charge a red ! she's first cousin to the'Mac-&#xD;
Takes, and no kin at all to the MacGives; and she's&#xD;
fooled the innocent lamb out of her money."&#xD;
The next morning our guests were seated on the&#xD;
back stoop, busily engaged in winding. their bright-&#xD;
colored wools, and making numberless pretty tab-&#xD;
leaux of themselves in their flowing robes and .easy&#xD;
attitudes, their white arms glancing here and there&#xD;
in the stray sunshine which flickered amongst the&#xD;
grape leaves, Jim in attendance, ready to chase any&#xD;
wandering ball into unknown corners, busy little Car&#xD;

lazily against the trellis, listening to Belle, who de-&#xD;
tailed to Kitty the particulars of her last evening's&#xD;
drive ; unmercifully ridiculing the elderly roue, whom&#xD;
she was spreading her choicest lures to entrap into her&#xD;
matrimonial net ; caricaturing his jockey driving,&#xD;
horse-talk; imitating his tones and gestures, with such&#xD;
ludicrous fidelity, that Kitty laughed whether she&#xD;
would or no; and I, the outsider whom she did not&#xD;
regard, could look upon her-beautiful, accomplished,&#xD;
fascinating, as I was forced to see her-with no&#xD;
eyes of favor, and said inlyr.-&#xD;
"Her sphere is the stage-the circus-anything but&#xD;
our old-fashioned home; and I heartily wish-" What&#xD;
I wished never found voice, for there came such an&#xD;
astonishing rat-a-tit upon our-brass knocker as must&#xD;
have wakened every sleeper of the seven, if they&#xD;
had made a dormitory of our sitting-room. Winnie&#xD;
being busy, in her usual abbreviated fashion of skirts,&#xD;
among her poultry, I made haste to open the door,&#xD;
and Mr. Nickson's smart colored servant delivered&#xD;
into my care some cards of invitation from a basket-&#xD;
fuilhe carried in his white-gloved hand.&#xD;
Mr. Nickson boasted much of choice bachelor&#xD;
quartersie revelled in at the Folly, an elegant place&#xD;
just outside of Merry Bank village, which had ruined&#xD;
its 'builder, and which he was very fond of enlarg.'&#xD;
ing upon. "I got it for a' song," he would say.'&#xD;
' Mirrors, gimcracks, and all; you see the fellow&#xD;

Occasionally, people going' thither of an evening&#xD;
would find hanging about the place a horsey, turfy,&#xD;
sport named Knox, who made it his -home, whether&#xD;
as friend or defendant of the -owner, was not exactly&#xD;
clear,; but as he tarried much in the stables, lady-&#xD;
visitors seldom encountered him.- There were, be-&#xD;
sides, three or four others of his stamp, who certainly&#xD;
were cronies of the banker, which gentleman. was&#xD;
extremely chary of appearing with them' in public.&#xD;
And. sounds of revelry by night were sometimes&#xD;
audible to belated travellers, in which was _no psalm-&#xD;
singing--and this conviviality centred in the Folly.,.&#xD;
Mr. -Nickson frequently promised the young peo-&#xD;
ple an entertainment,_ which he declared should&#xD;
"take the rag off anything ever heard of in this old&#xD;
rat-hole of a place "--meaning our- flourishing vil-&#xD;
lage., He resolved, also, to dazzle the blue- eyes of&#xD;
Miss Brandon, whqse practised manners kept him .in&#xD;
a tittilation of uncertainty as to the.state of her affec-&#xD;
tions, despite his horses, one of which he had named&#xD;
in her honor, and his polite assiduities. 'This "feety&#xD;
champeter,'" as he styled his party, he, decided should&#xD;
be the crowning charm, nd ,he also turned over in&#xD;
his mind the, feasibility of a proposal, then and there&#xD;
Of course, all Merry Bank was on the gui vive, and&#xD;
gala-dresses were furbished up, glovescleaned, 'and&#xD;
curls baked for the occasion.  Susan Dusenbury&#xD;

Squirmwell was tormented by somethingon the end&#xD;
of her nose which she called "an excrescence," and&#xD;
which Mrs. Ramble said was nothing in the world but&#xD;
a pimple. Mrs. Ramble, who was full of congenial&#xD;
occupation, going from house to house and .asking&#xD;
questions, and she and Mrs. Pillhackle quarrelled like&#xD;
Ferrex and Porrex over the uses and abuses of&#xD;
amusements, and 'Mrs. Deacon Rotterdam waited on&#xD;
the minister, as soon as she found her girls were not&#xD;
likely to get invitations, and requested him to preach&#xD;

paid to Lamode's shop, and golden was the harvest&#xD;
she reaped during the week of grace the host had&#xD;
kindly placed between thelhidding' and the festival.&#xD;
Even our -lawyer was in a- high state of delectation,&#xD;

His old favorite and pupil in Greek, which dry dust&#xD;
he had imbibed like hi mother's milk-Archie Lau-&#xD;

the Folly, after an  sence of four years. He was a&#xD;
great favorite in Merry Bank, where he had lived as&#xD;
a boy with his rich maiden aunt, at ~her place, the&#xD;
Quince Bush, whose charming grounds, choice con-&#xD;
servatories, ferneries, graperies, etc., were the admi-&#xD;
rration of the country round. Many were the tales&#xD;
Henry had already told his guests, especially Kitty,&#xD;
of his young paragon's goodness, his pleasant wit, his&#xD;
skill in all manly sports, his overflowing fun and&#xD;
jollity. Of course, the village girls were counting'&#xD;

upon the return of the finished gentleman, who had&#xD;
been so merry and useful amongst them as a rosy&#xD;
cheeked youngster; and speculations were rife as to.&#xD;
the change years might have effected in his person&#xD;
and his heart.&#xD;
Belle Brandon flashed up her blue eyes when she&#xD;
heard the news, glancing triumphantly in the mirror.&#xD;
She threw back her perfect shoulders, and practised&#xD;
the artless toss of her- blonde curls, mentally calcu-&#xD;
lating her chances for a handsome, young husband,&#xD;
before she settled irrevocably down with 1Vr. Nick&#xD;
son, whose ugly, old, brdwny-red. face, marked with&#xD;
crows'-feet, seamed with wrinkles, nearly made her&#xD;
shudder every time she looked at it. One drawback&#xD;
tormented her : she had brought to Merry Bank no&#xD;
party-dresses: and half the effect of her beauty, as&#xD;
she well knew, depended upon her attire.&#xD;
The momentous question, "What shall we wear?"&#xD;
was on the tapis in the Blue Corner, the day of the&#xD;
invitation.&#xD;
"I'm sure I don't know what I'm to do," said&#xD;
Belle sourly; she could be sour now and then, ever&#xD;
to Mignonne.  "I didn't expect parties in this out-of-&#xD;
the-way place, and of course I didn't ihmber upimy&#xD;
trunk with useless apparel."&#xD;
"I didn't either, for I had none to briig," replied&#xD;
Kitty merrily; "ewe are not allowed su\ follies at&#xD;
school, except parlor nights, and we never had any&#xD;
gentlemen, only the old teachers ; and the em-&#xD;

find; maybe she will have some bargains for me,&#xD;

Kitty stopped short, and her gleeful face elongated&#xD;
as she remembered that almost for the first time in&#xD;
her life she had no money. She flushed scarlet as&#xD;
she met Belle's glance, whose mind during Kitty's&#xD;
prattle had been attentively working out the prob-&#xD;
lem of her own toilette. Recalled by the closing re-&#xD;
mark and the child's blushing cheeks, her thoughts now&#xD;
posted in the same direction, and she began charac-&#xD;
teristically to count the chances of kitty's declining&#xD;
the invitation to the Folly, in which case she might&#xD;
borrow some of her best things and shine unrivalled.&#xD;
"However," she said encouragingly, "muslin is well&#xD;
enough for you, Mignonne; your style don't need&#xD;
much dress.; and as for the tear,. Carlotta will be&#xD;
delighted to exercise her skill upon it,; and really,&#xD;

"Then why do you listen, Belle; you know quite&#xD;

replied the straightforward Kitty.&#xD;
" When you know more you won't utter nonsense,&#xD;

shortly, taking up her hand-glass and giving careful&#xD;
attention to her complexion. "Be,, in with the back&#xD;

"But I promised Henry to go berryingwith him&#xD;
this afternoon, down by Gully Brook ; wouldn't to-&#xD;

and was loath to lose her promised ramble in the&#xD;
sweet-smelling woods.&#xD;
" Do leave my dress alone, then !" spoke up Belle&#xD;
crossly; "I'll take care how I ask you to help me&#xD;
again. I do despise selfishness, above ground ! "&#xD;

looked out on the green fields, beyond which she&#xD;

seemed to see Gully Brook dashing and splashing&#xD;
over its rocky bed; and she cut away in silence for&#xD;
some time at the close, fine threads, which required&#xD;
the nicest care, Belle never moving or looking in&#xD;
her direction.  Kitty occasionally felt her friend's&#xD;
yoke a-little heavy, but had no courage to cast it off.&#xD;
It was so necessary to her comfort to be on good&#xD;
terms with all around her; she couldn't bear to have&#xD;
even Winnie scowl at her ; which, to say true, the old&#xD;
creature rarely did, no matter how nimbly rampageous&#xD;
were her tantrums. She had stolen many side-looks-&#xD;
at the blonde, and was just making up her mind to&#xD;
say something good-humored and mollifying, when&#xD;
there came a brisk, lively knock at the door, and she&#xD;
sprang up, glad of any event to break up the situ-a-&#xD;
tion, and ,any excuse to slip away from the hateful&#xD;
ripping to her dear woman-friend and comforter.&#xD;
Henry stood on the landing  like a benignant&#xD;
"slave of the lamp," bearing a huge square box in&#xD;
his arm, which he deposited on the floor, taking off&#xD;
his-hat and bowing low to Kitty.&#xD;
"Remember the porter, miss," said he ; "for by&#xD;
the foot of Plutarch, 'tis a warm day to be toting&#xD;
bundles-here's a package all the way from New&#xD;
Orleans, and here also is a pair of sharp black eyes&#xD;
peeping over my shoulder, as full of curiosity as they&#xD;
are of mischief, and the woman who manages them is,&#xD;
all impatience to inspect and-pronounce upon these&#xD;
contents. Oh, I see ; you are entertaining company&#xD;

Miss Brandon, your servant-comes-vous-portizes-&#xD;

Belle replied with a musical laugh and very perfect&#xD;
French to his Anglo-Franco salutation';. though she&#xD;
perfectly comprehended his marked manner.  She&#xD;
also understood the legal maxim, " Possession is nine&#xD;
points of the law," and wa not a whit abashed, and&#xD;
she secretly and adroitly h id her pounce-box and&#xD;
wiped her anointed face on her handkerchief.&#xD;
Kitty dropped on her knees' at once, clapping her&#xD;
hands joyfully. " How good of you to bring it ! from&#xD;
papa, dear, kind papa!"&#xD;
Her eager fingers were alltoo trembling to undo&#xD;
the stiff cords, and she glanced about for the knife&#xD;
she had dropped in such a hurry.&#xD;
"Not so fast! young lady," remarked Henry&#xD;
quietly, catching her hand; " not so fast, if you please;&#xD;
those stout strings are just the things for my grape-&#xD;
vines; therefore we will not waste them. I'll spare&#xD;
your fingers."&#xD;
He mischievously took time to untie all the hard&#xD;
knots, enjoying Kitty's pokings and impatience&#xD;
While we were all guessing, wondering, and exclaim-&#xD;
ing, who should walk into the Blue Corner but Mrs.&#xD;

and seating herself with her customary aplomb, she&#xD;

[spelling out the address.] Miss Kitty Clayton; oh!&#xD;

over. I dessay there's somethin' nice inside ; I don't&#xD;

the perishable, beggarly elements of this fleeting world.&#xD;
' Remember the days of darkness,. for they shall be&#xD;
many.'&#xD;
I opine that Mrs. Ramble must have seen the arri-&#xD;
val of the box, and had hastened over to the opening ;&#xD;
I'm strengthened in this belief by the fact that little&#xD;
ever came into the Red Cottage which she did not see ;&#xD;
and that reminds me, it was only last week that she&#xD;
dispatched her son Bill with a wash-hand basin to&#xD;
our front door, with this enigmatical request:&#xD;
"Mother wants some of that ere what come home in&#xD;
the bag." Moreover, on this occasion, her snuffy hands&#xD;
presented a parboiled appearance; and she was&#xD;
odorous of dish-water,as if she had dropped a neces-&#xD;
sary domestic occupation in a hurry.&#xD;
At last the stubborn knots yielded ; the cover was&#xD;
lifted, ad;d the first thing which caught Kitty's eye&#xD;
was 4 letter, which she eagerly seized and kissed, her&#xD;

cheeks flushing, and her eyes filling. Mr. Clayton&#xD;
said: "As his daughter was staying withhis old friend,&#xD;
he wished her to do him credit in her appearance, as&#xD;
well as conduct; and he had selected some finery,&#xD;
such as he supposed girls loved, and he. hoped she&#xD;
would enjoy it, and be happy, before the days when&#xD;
she should have to say, ' I have no pleasure in them ;'&#xD;
and enjoined upon her to be always the true, honest,&#xD;
faithful girl he believed her, for the sake of her dead&#xD;
mother ;" then leaving off abruptly, he signed himself,&#xD;
" your father, Paul Clayton," and underneath, in a&#xD;
postscript., as if an after-thought, .he added a few&#xD;
scrawled words : " I ani glad you have found a friend&#xD;
whom you like; she seems a handsome woman, much&#xD;
older and ought to be much wiser than my simple&#xD;
Kitty; and so you love your old father ; well, I am&#xD;
glad of it. Sometimes I think I will come on and&#xD;
fetch you 'away. I have thought of you often, since&#xD;
I read your last, sitting by me. at table, fetching my&#xD;
slippers, sewing on my buttons,; but I could not take,&#xD;
care of a girl. I should -not .know what to do with&#xD;
you. You are best off where you are. Perhaps next&#xD;
year I'll come and see you ; but not now ; I cannot&#xD;
leave ; my business wil. not permit ; -e a good child."&#xD;
Kitty hid the note in her bosom, .ith a little sob,&#xD;
and sat quietly by, with her thoughtful face in her&#xD;
hands ; while Carlotta laid out, one by one, the hand-&#xD;
some gifts so 'opportunely arrived. Jim came purring&#xD;
along with his tail in the air, and rubbed his head&#xD;
sympathetically against her. She seized upon him and&#xD;

hugged him close in her arms; she longed to pour out&#xD;
her Love in caresses-her pent-up love, which her&#xD;
father had never sought.&#xD;
Is the nice papa coming to his little girl ?" inquired&#xD;
Belle in a~ lotr voice, while the others were busy&#xD;
about the- box; she .had been eagerly watching the&#xD;
child, and determined to know. at once, because if he&#xD;
proposed to appearron the scene she might find rea-&#xD;
son to shape quite differently her conduct.&#xD;
"What does he say about the bit of ugliness we&#xD;
dispatched to him by post-?"&#xD;
"Not much," answered Kitty unconcernedly. In&#xD;
fact, she had not given special attention to the part of&#xD;
the missive of most importance to her friend. "There&#xD;
are no secrets,; you can read, if you like. He is not&#xD;
coming this year. I didn't believe he would; and he&#xD;
won't."&#xD;
"So it seems," replied Belle, tossing back the&#xD;
letter after a hasty perusal ; and she looked queerly,&#xD;
at Kitty, while she mentally added, "'Much older !'&#xD;
You shall pay me for that, cherie; and I must&#xD;
'inadvertently marry the banker.'"&#xD;
There were two dresses-one of blue satin, the&#xD;
other- of white crape, soft and rich, like wrinkled&#xD;
cream; a box of gloves, a pearl and parchment fan,&#xD;
a set of elegant handkerchiefs, a silver bouquet-holder&#xD;
set'-.with turquoises, and a very fanciful mouchoir&#xD;
ring-a tiger's claw, which sprang upon its prey and&#xD;
held it fast; beneath the whole lay a small casket of,&#xD;
purple morocco,- which Carlotta put into Kitty's&#xD;

hand, with a little finger squeeze. She knew for&#xD;
certain that it contained something precious. She&#xD;
opened it, and lo ! a sparkling diamond, in foreign&#xD;
setting, and bearing within the shank the letters&#xD;
"P. C. to my wife."  Her mother's ring ! she had&#xD;
often' seen it upon her father's finger, and now it was&#xD;
hers-her very own.&#xD;
" Oh ! my dear papa!" she exclaimed raptur&#xD;
ously, "how nice! how kind !" And she put it on,&#xD;
feeling as if she had gained a talisman--a token of&#xD;
great good. Oh ! how many times she pressed it to&#xD;
her lips in the after days, when her heart was heavy,&#xD;
and troubles shut out joy. It was like a message of&#xD;
love and strength from her mother in heaven. Mean-&#xD;
while Miss Brandon was darting envious glances from&#xD;
'her blue eyes at the costly fabrics Kitty had almost&#xD;
forgotten in her single-hearted joy. Her mouth es,&#xD;
pecially watered at the shining satin of cerulean tint,&#xD;
whose heavy softness quite fascinated her.  She&#xD;
had worn such a robe one night to Wallack's, when&#xD;
she met there Mr. Cragenfels, whom she did not.&#xD;
marry.&#xD;
" I would fain know of Heaven," she muttered,&#xD;
"why yon fool should wear a suit of satin ?" and&#xD;
with the words there came also a memory of a&#xD;
merry-hearted youngster named Chandy, who was&#xD;
accustomed to take large liberties with Billy Shakes.&#xD;
She threw off the whole train of disagreeable reflec-&#xD;
tions, and fixed- a spiteful glance upon the little Kit-&#xD;
ty's' childish face and drooping figure, sitting on her&#xD;

low stool so absently, with her ring at her lips, and&#xD;
her eyes gazing afar off with their look of sorrowful,&#xD;
yearning.&#xD;
"Superb enough for a duchess-or for me ! and&#xD;
to be cut down to that snip! Reductio ad absurdum !&#xD;
Icould put it on and look as if it had been woven&#xD;
expressly for me; but that child ! Paugh ! a ridicu-&#xD;

and me in my old ashes-of-roses--never ! - I won't'&#xD;

I must plan a way to bring them back into their&#xD;
proper channel."&#xD;
She frowned. upon her offending brocade, which&#xD;
was handsome enough, as were sundry others in her&#xD;
collection, and pushed it out of sight in disgust..&#xD;
"That's a real putty little foot of your'n," said&#xD;
Mrs. Ramble, who. was shrewdly watching the im-&#xD;
patient tap-tap of said foot on the carpet; "real&#xD;
small, but I 'spose you pay just as much for your&#xD;
shoes as other folks."&#xD;
" Oh !" replied.Belle, with superb modesty, with-&#xD;
drawing it not from 1Mrs, Ramble's eyes, but Hen-&#xD;
ry's, which she became aware were, directed upon it,&#xD;
"I was not conscious that my slipper was in society,&#xD;
or that there was a chiel among us takin' notes.! ",.&#xD;
She rose and stood by the bed upon which. Car-&#xD;
lotta had placed the things. "This is a pretty ma-&#xD;
terial, Kitty," said she, taking up the satin. "What&#xD;
a pity it is got rose-color-bring out your charming&#xD;

blushes so effectively. It seems to a looker-on in&#xD;
Venice as if satin might be a trifle old and heavy for&#xD;
your style ; you are such a little fairy, you aught to.&#xD;
be always floating about in white gauze. Light fab-&#xD;
rics are the only fabrics for angels and sixteen ;&#xD;
better stick to them while you can. Satin goes with&#xD;
majesty," throwing a look at her shoulder and well-&#xD;
developed stature reflected in the mirror behind her,&#xD;
and a merry glance. at those about her, as if she&#xD;
acknowledged and despised her own vanity ; which&#xD;
pretty tableau I privately considered meant for Henry&#xD;
alone. " We and us are the only ones who may ap-&#xD;
propriately array ourselves in the garb of royalty."&#xD;
Carlotta turned her eyes quizzically upon- the&#xD;
speaker, but for once she agreed with her. She took&#xD;
the blue Lustrina from her hands, folded it carefully,&#xD;
and restored it to its brown-paper wrapping.&#xD;
"Kitty, you shall wear the crape first, with your&#xD;
point bertha. It will be the perfection of rare sim-&#xD;
plicity. As Belle very judiciously puts it, satin is&#xD;
rather heavy for your salad days. She and I are&#xD;
ripe enough for it, but we haven't got it. You have.&#xD;
There will come a time when it will be just the thing,&#xD;

"with-a--pearls-; and I hope I shall have the pleas-&#xD;
ure of arraying you !&#xD;
"A long look ahead ; longer than A. S. Roe's,"&#xD;
said Kitty, sighing, and making a rosy mouth. "I&#xD;

her armsabout her woman-friend.&#xD;
"Nonsense-! me! Did you ever see a thunder&#xD;
cloud walking round ? Well, wait till you see me in&#xD;
blue' garment. I've got through lovering. . You&#xD;
haven't begun ; therefore lay aside the pretty'stuff&#xD;
till curly-head appears," replied Carlotta in the same&#xD;
tone=.&#xD;
"Law!" said Mrs. Ramble, "Kitty! why she's&#xD;
just the girl tp get one real good, stick-tight of a fel-&#xD;
lar. Some girls has beaux enough, but they don't&#xD;
seem to have the -knack of turnin' any on 'em into a&#xD;

Miss Brandog appeared not to hear.&#xD;
Point lace is rather ancient for Cherie, n'estpas?&#xD;
Don't you think a fall of'blonde would better suit a&#xD;
schogirl?. s.= much lighter and more gossamer."&#xD;
In fancy she saw the exquisite bertha about her own&#xD;
shoulders over the coveted blue satin.&#xD;
Not at all," replied Carlotta, with projt deci-&#xD;
sion; ":especially as Kitty happens to possess the&#xD;
one-very handsome; and can't get the other with-&#xD;
out useless trouble. I don't suppose Lame-has a&#xD;
yard of real blonde in her shbp;and if she had loads&#xD;
of it, it would not signify; Kitty should wear what'&#xD;
her papa has sent hem  Won't you, pet ?."&#xD;
Kitty smiled, as did we alleven Mrs. Ramble, at&#xD;
Carloita's brisk, positive way, and the little spice of&#xD;
hasty brashness her contact with the blonde was&#xD;
quite stare to bring out.&#xD;

" Hadn't you better order a cap and spectacles to&#xD;
complete the costume ? " sneered Belle. "You out-&#xD;
of-the-way people do have the most antediluvian&#xD;
ideas. 0 tempora / 0 mores / as we used to say at&#xD;
school."&#xD;
"Esto guod else videris, as we used to say. I'll&#xD;
translate, if you wish."&#xD;
"Oh, thank you ; it isn't necessary ; we learned all&#xD;
those trite things out of the great dictionary, where,&#xD;
I suppose, you found them," replied Belle, whose&#xD;
temper was likely to get the better tof her in Carlotta's&#xD;
neighborhood, if anywhere.&#xD;
Carlotta was fond of saying, "Human nature is&#xD;
sure to caper if you poke it ;" and she did poke it&#xD;
pretty often when such characters as Miss-iBraxklbn's&#xD;
were-thrust in  her way s&#xD;
Mrs. Ramble's sharp eyes had taken in the whole.&#xD;
""Ha! ha 1" laughed she. "Carlotty is enough for&#xD;
you. You don't get ahead of her none.i' dot&#xD;

she's enough for you. .,You wouldn't shirk the hand}&#xD;

Belle particularly disliked Mrs.amble--her snuffi"&#xD;

which" keeked through ;ivr other folkwi' nicead&#xD;

snappish. When' Kitty.offered to resume&#xD;
the ripping,.be - aat   the dress out of her&#xD;
hand, and threw it under the bed; and turning her&#xD;
back upon the astomshe  girl, and shaking fretfully&#xD;
her shoulders, she curled herself in a discontented&#xD;
heap on the.sofa, and said: "Do go along and leave&#xD;
me alone." Kitty colored, and an angrf speech rose&#xD;
to her lips, but she checked it in time : her life train-&#xD;
ing had practically taught her "least said soonest&#xD;
.mended;" and going quickly frpm the Blue Corner,&#xD;
she shut the door, ran downstairs, out through the&#xD;
kitchen, ' never stopping till she reached that haven of&#xD;
&#xD;
peace, the barn, where she came upon Henry, assum-&#xD;
ing the Pecksniffian costu me, preparatory to his rural&#xD;
labors, and after obliging Jim to jump through her&#xD;
hands about fifty times, which feat he always accom-&#xD;
plished with flattened ears and a scowling countenance,,&#xD;
she entered heartily into the "chores, and soon for-&#xD;
got all causes of annoyance,&#xD;
The next morning Bellemet Kitty at her door.&#xD;
She was faultlessly-attired in the sheerest and clearest&#xD;
of muslins; iand her.handsome features were radiant&#xD;
with gushing innocence. She kissed dear Migiionne&#xD;
on- both cheeks, and descended the stairs with'one&#xD;
beautiful arm around her waist. At breakfast she&#xD;
was gossipy, witty, amusing, delightful. That deal&#xD;
happily over, she enticed Kitty up to the Blue Corner,&#xD;
and shut carefully the door. "Cherie," she com-&#xD;
menced, winding the child's curls around her fingers&#xD;
"how abundant your hair is ! positively, it ia thep&amp;amp;&#xD;

purring, she came at length to the business of the&#xD;
time. /'jDo you know, Cherie, I've been thinking&#xD;
perhaps Ihad better offer to take that satin off your'&#xD;
hands; you will look like your, great-grandmother in&#xD;
it, if you ever attempt to put it on ; and as to laying&#xD;
it aside, perfect fudge I with your-father's wealth and&#xD;
munificence, and the quantities of things he is perpet-&#xD;

that I did not have a beneficent parent of my own; I&#xD;
could makedone so useful. It;seems that all the good&#xD;
gifts are bestowed o inconsequent recipients who can't&#xD;
put them to proper service. Just think, Kitty I I am&#xD;
an orphan--nobody to love . me, nobody to send me&#xD;
anything."&#xD;
Kitty was very sorry for her, not so much for the&#xD;
words as. the hopeless, dejected manner of them, :and&#xD;
she really felt as if there must be a great wrong in&#xD;
getting so much, when poor Belle needed everything;&#xD;
and she put her arms around her neck and kissed her.&#xD;
*I can't seg what ever induced your papa to post&#xD;
on such an old-time piece of goods; nobody wears&#xD;
satins now."&#xD;
Kitty'took away her arm.  "My father always&#xD;
sends me handsome things. The girls said so. There&#xD;
weren't such pretty organdies and linens in tire whole&#xD;

revelation of Kitty's careless innocence, in which the&#xD;
child gleefully joined, happy to reflect anybody's&#xD;
good-humor without taking trouble to hunt out the&#xD;
joke.&#xD;
"I can readily believe it, Cherie; but in this. in-&#xD;

should try. I know my good Kitty would not feel&#xD;
right to go fie to Lanagan's ball, and have her poor&#xD;
Belle shabby. I judge others by myself. 1 could&#xD;
not endure such a though-, but it is a weakness of&#xD;
mine to lavish too much sympathy on my friends. I&#xD;
feel pretty sure the satin will fray, but I will make it&#xD;
with a cord, and I can get three or four good wears&#xD;

Notwithstanding Belle's soft purring, with all her&#xD;
claws in velvet, Kitty hesitated.. Even she, simple-&#xD;
ton as she was, could not be insensible to the richness&#xD;
of the, costly satin, although she knew as little as a&#xD;
girl could of money values ; her abundant allowance&#xD;
was disbursed for trifles, and quite as often for her&#xD;
friends', including her chum Laura Gwin, as for her&#xD;
own pleasure ; and the clothing bills were made up and&#xD;
forwarded with the others by Madame Devereaux.&#xD;
She reflected that Carlotta would not approve such a&#xD;
disposition of her papa's gifts; it seemed like slight-&#xD;
ing his kindness, but then it was only a dress, after&#xD;
all; there .were plenty more where that came from;&#xD;
Belle would look lovely in it ; she liked seeing her&#xD;
friends look lovely, and as artfully put before her, it&#xD;
would be selfish to refuse, and she had no funds.&#xD;
What a pity there had not been also a cheque in the&#xD;
box! then Belle could have the satin in welcome, and&#xD;
n t ing disagreeable to be said about it. Some coax&#xD;
in of Carlotta-oh yes, Carlotta certainly would&#xD;
cold her-she must try to make her see that it could&#xD;
not be helped, and-ah! now came the rub !-her&#xD;
heart rose up in hei throat and choked her, while she&#xD;
faintly brought forth the words, looking down and&#xD;
blushing like a culprit:&#xD;
"I must ave some money, you know,, Belle,&#xD;
and if you could pay me a little directly. It is non-&#xD;
sense to lay it up for the great occasion Carlie talks&#xD;
about, when I have got no lover; .so if you will give&#xD;

The blonde, had been eagerly watching -and impa-&#xD;
tiently awaiting her decision, while she mused;and she&#xD;
hastily seized the goods which they had had spread out&#xD;
on the bed side by side with the wrinkled cream, and&#xD;
folding it hurriedly, she stepped quickly and thrust it&#xD;
into her trunk, which shelocked, and brought away&#xD;
the key in her pocket.&#xD;
"'There: that is consummated!" exclaimed she,&#xD;
airily; "who says we are not business women.? You&#xD;
should thank me for putting the stuff to use- you&#xD;
and I must make a sensation dancing in the same set,&#xD;
of course we shall enter the room together; we will&#xD;
illustrate for- the benefit of these country folks' the&#xD;
two styles of beauty, the petite and the queenly; and&#xD;
just fancy me twirling in the. mazy (i suppose I can't&#xD;
get through the evening without it), encircled by the&#xD;
arm of the graceful, gallant Nickson. I hope Ae will&#xD;
wear gloves,! his hands make me creep: files and&#xD;
graters are silky-satin compared to them. By the&#xD;
way, Mignonne, don't mention our private matters to&#xD;
anybody, Carlotta especially. I should like to sur-&#xD;
'prise her.; a' capital joke, you see ; and besides, she&#xD;
might make unpleasant remarks to you, thoughVcertes&#xD;
I don't perceive 'any reason for it. But there's Rno&#xD;

don't fetter her free-soul. -How you can laugh when.&#xD;
you see her round eyes as she espies 'us ! =I feelthat&#xD;

Coaxing, wheedling, purring, she managed a ,rom-&#xD;

&#xD;
dismissed her with droll talk; merry laughter, and a&#xD;
little practice of some fancy steps she had shone in&#xD;
long ago, when her rose-colored slips scarcely reached&#xD;
her knees, and which she executed with as lithe a grace&#xD;
as if the far-off childhood were a yesterday ; but never'&#xD;
a word of money. "Base is the slave who pays,"&#xD;
and Belle Brandon was innocent of such baseness.&#xD;
An hour or two afterward, she came downstairs,&#xD;
dressed for a walk, with a brown-paper package&#xD;
under her arm.&#xD;
"Where .are you going?" asked Kitty, who was&#xD;
nursing Jim on the door-steps, trying to feel suite&#xD;
that although she hal not gotten her money, she&#xD;
certainly should get it directly, notwithstanding the&#xD;
fact that in h9r superabundant fun the handsome&#xD;
debtor had forgotten it.&#xD;
Up to the dress-maker's, Mignonne;" Bellepassed&#xD;
hurriedly on. Kitty hastily pushed Jim out of her&#xD;
lap and/followed to the gate  " Belle,'' faltered she,&#xD;
looking and feeling as if she were committing a crime,&#xD;
but nerved up- to the utterance by dire necessity;&#xD;
"Belle, I wish you would pay me, at least a part.,&#xD;
before you go; I must also get my dress made."&#xD;
" But I cannot, Mignonne: I am impecunious, abso..&#xD;
lutely a pauper I You must not seize on your fellow..&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
" I SHALL BE A LADY FOREVER."       I&#xD;
"How long, pray ?-,an eternity has not passed&#xD;
since the transaction ; and besides, the cheque isn't&#xD;
always punctual to a minute ; just as soon as it ar-&#xD;
rives, my precious Kitty shall surely come into her&#xD;
own again, like .Bonnie Prince Charlie."&#xD;
" But, Belle, forgive me ; I am qtiite certain I saw&#xD;
the cheque .in the letter Henry handed you-at dinner.&#xD;
You opened it, remember, the bit, of paper dropped&#xD;
out, I picked it up and. restored it. to you. I am&#xD;
sorry, dear Belle, to be troublesome, but I don't see&#xD;
how I am to get ready for the party without- it; a&#xD;
little will do ; I don't value the money--you know&#xD;
that ; I am not stingy; and if I could help it, I would&#xD;
never ask- you ; you might keep it all, and. welcome;&#xD;
I know papa will send me enough before long;, but&#xD;
you see I can't go if I don't have some now."&#xD;
Belle actually blushed, and for an instant. looked&#xD;
almost ashamed: but it was only an instant.; she had&#xD;
so long ago contracted a habit of strangling her good&#xD;
impulses in the birth., that they gave her- little trouble&#xD;
now. She hated to part with money at-any time;&#xD;
she believed Kitty would not betray her ; if she&#xD;
could not get the dress made, she would, of course,&#xD;
stay at home and leave the field clear, and finally&#xD;
she justified her conduct by the thought that the&#xD;
child might obtain all she needed, by applying to the&#xD;
Red Cottage' folks ; and if they dared mention the,&#xD;
transaction to her, which was not likely, why then,&#xD;
"business, necessity'"-and: that was all there was&#xD;
about it.&#xD;

"That cheque ! oh, that 'was a mere bagatelle--&#xD;
gone. immediately, ,lie the sparks which fly upward,&#xD;
or the spirit of the beast, which goeth downward,&#xD;
You 'nust wait, child ; I actually have no money;-&#xD;
besides, I expect to make a bill with that hideous&#xD;
Snuffandbark, and why can't yodo go and do likewise;&#xD;
that is the command, you know."&#xD;
A bill ! with a perfect stranger ! ask to be&#xD;
trusted ! I couldn't do it."&#xD;
"Well, then, ask dear Heinrich'; he will 'give&#xD;
you the key of his chest if you will marry him, him,.&#xD;
him," hummed Belle, provokingly.&#xD;
"I would stay at home forever, first ! " burst out&#xD;
Kitty, her eyes- filling; "you are}unkind to speak&#xD;
of such a horrid thing! "&#xD;
" I don't see the barbarity, Cherie, but if you are&#xD;
so monstrously delicate, I. am afraid I cannot propose&#xD;
any way out of your dilemma.MI had supposed I.&#xD;
was to be clapped on the shoulder, like a thief by the-&#xD;
sheriff, I would never have offered to take the trum -&#xD;

and wish to have it back, say so, and there's an end ;&#xD;
of course it is of no consequence to you whether or&#xD;
no Igo to the party ; you can have your good time. "4&#xD;
Belle, you are too cruel ! I. don't care about the&#xD;
money now-you need not pay me-no ! never !--in&#xD;
the wide world ! I wouldn't touch it !"&#xD;
Bursting into tears, Kitty leaned over the post,&#xD;
and,°covered her face with her hands, and Miss Bran-&#xD;
don shut -the gate with a wicked little slam-bang,&#xD;
&#xD;
I SHALL BE A LADY FOREVER."       I t&#xD;
and walked gracefully away ; and " Mignonne " re-&#xD;
turned pretty soon, very slowly, and sat down again,&#xD;
and took up Jim, who bore no malice for his hasty&#xD;
dismissal, but pure his loudest, and rubbed his head&#xD;
sympathetically against her hot cheeks. Her fit'of&#xD;
passion was over; it subsided into a sorA feeling of&#xD;
injury, a friendless, outside, chilly, comfortless state&#xD;
of mind, which most of us can remember to have ex-&#xD;
perienced at some time in our lives, as I suppose there&#xD;
are few who have not been outwitted by some clever&#xD;
one, and laughed at.&#xD;
During dinner Henry made some joking 'allusion&#xD;
to the approaching festivity.  Kitty colored up and&#xD;
said, " I'm not going to the frolic, Henry; I've con-&#xD;
cluded not."&#xD;
Our lawyer looked closely at her, took note of her&#xD;
red, swollen eyes, and scarlet cheeks. He kept his&#xD;
thoughts to himself, 'but though we were at table, and&#xD;
he had a tempting morsel of chicken on his fork, he&#xD;
laid it down and commenced humming "Why should&#xD;
we mourn "-tune'"China," as if it had been a funeral&#xD;
occasion.&#xD;
Carlotta, brisk, little black-eyed Carlotta, ex-&#xD;
claimed in astonishment,' Not 'going, Kitty ! when&#xD;

a little honey-bee, and hadn't taken time yet even&#xD;
to look at Kitty, so busy was she in pouring out&#xD;
tea. We always have with our dinner green tea at the&#xD;
Red Cottage, one sniff of which would put life into a_&#xD;
dying woman, to say nothing of its exquisite flavor,&#xD;
which soothes, exhilarates, and brings out all the fine&#xD;
points of our nature; we are never so chatty and con-&#xD;
versable as at dinner. Mrs. Ramble is fond of bor-&#xD;
rowing our tea. "jKitty, my love," said she, setting&#xD;
down the old-fashioned silver teapot with a heron&#xD;
engraved upon it-" Kitty! you've been crying; tell&#xD;
me directly what is the matter."&#xD;
" Now, Carlotta,. don't speak cross," burst out-&#xD;
Kitty, going round and falling upon her woman-&#xD;
friend's neck, whose tone had been a little curt, but&#xD;
with the child in her mind only as sufferer, her&#xD;
thoughts indignantly covering Belle Brandon's hand-&#xD;
some self as the actor. "Now you don't know how&#xD;
bad you make me feel; I think I am very unhappy."&#xD;
So what could Carlotta 'do, but push away her&#xD;
chair from the table, take her darling into her arms,&#xD;
and comfort her, then and there, and Henry went off&#xD;
in a hurry, without waiting for dessert. , We heard&#xD;
him away beyond the gate humming the consoling&#xD;
strains of a "doleful dump; " and also the lowing of&#xD;
the little sea-cow, who failed to attract his .ttention.&#xD;
Of course Carlotta set herself1to find out £he cause&#xD;
of the hidden grief. Kitty refused to confess, and as&#xD;
all her pressing only added to her misery, without&#xD;
any other effect than the little head-shake, and " I&#xD;

promised not to tell, Carlie, so 'don't nake me," she&#xD;
dried her pet's tears, and hushed her like- a baby.&#xD;
After seeing her comfortably busy with sorMe red&#xD;
berries, tiny shells and mosses, and a cross -f card-&#xD;
board, in which dainty work sloe was exceeding&#xD;
skilful, our Martha went up town on her round of er-&#xD;
rands. Stepping into Lamode's, that gossipy shop-&#xD;
keeper asked her how she liked the beautiful handker-&#xD;
'chief Miss Brandon had got of her, "such a bargain;&#xD;
adding, "Miss Clayton is a charming young lady,. and&#xD;
so free with her money. 'Tisn't everybody would lend&#xD;
fifty dollars as easily; just pulling it out and throw-&#xD;
ing it into her friend's hand, like nothing at all.' But&#xD;
they say her fathertis awful rich ; so I suppose it comes&#xD;
as easy as it goes ; well, it must be nice to have what&#xD;
you want without stitching it out of your poor fin-&#xD;
gers."&#xD;
'As very- little was elicited by her information, she&#xD;
went on another topic. "What a beautiful dress it&#xD;
is that Miss Brandon has got for the great party, to be&#xD;
sure ! she had. it here this morning; in fact, she is&#xD;
stairs now with Miss Snuffandbark."&#xD;
Carlotta knew in an instant what it was, and she&#xD;
replied carelessly,&#xD;
"Ah! the blue satin?"&#xD;
"Yes, indeed,'and so particular as she is about&#xD;
the fit; she is alittle bothersome to work for on account,&#xD;
of knowing so much herself ; but she's got a beautiful&#xD;
bust; my head-woman is hard at work, and you may&#xD;
be sure we shall do our prettiest to please any c .&#xD;

are. Won't you take those tidies, Miss Gorton ?&#xD;
they're cheap.as dirt, and a perfect'*imitation of Hon-&#xD;

After Carlotta had gone, Lamode said to Miss&#xD;
Snuffandbark, "I was determined to let them know&#xD;
about that handkerchief, because you mark my words,&#xD;
that fifty dollars will never get back into the little&#xD;
fool's purse, if the other one can get rid of paying it.&#xD;
She's an old hand, she is ; I must keep the right side&#xD;
of her-if she's going, tcy marry Nickson; maybe a&#xD;
good customer, I wonder what the proud' thing 'd&#xD;
say if she knew he spent. half his evenings here&#xD;
amongst my girls, as sociable as old cheese-he isn't&#xD;
proud."&#xD;
"Kitty," said Carlotta, after admiring the com-.&#xD;
pleted cross, which was indeed very artistic, "let's take&#xD;
another look at your pretties. It is time to set about&#xD;
making up your dress-at least to decide which of&#xD;
the-two you will choose ; of course you need not take&#xD;
my say-so about it."&#xD;
".Oh ! I'm going to wear the crape, if I go-but I&#xD;
shan't go."&#xD;
"Don't make that silly remark again, unless you&#xD;
wish to vex'1 me," answered Carlotta. "I shall not&#xD;
hear of your staying at home. Have you forgotten&#xD;
your desire for a lover ? no ? I thought not. You&#xD;
needn't hang your pretty head and pout. I've made'&#xD;
a privatearrangement with the fates to have you find&#xD;
one in that ball-room  I expect to introduce you to.&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
my male pet, Archie.   I hope he won't fail to&#xD;
come."&#xD;
Still talking, and pretending riot to notice Kitty's&#xD;
flushing cheeks or her unwillingness, she put one arm&#xD;
around her, and drew her upstairs, the poor child&#xD;
feeling as if she was about to be- executed, but hav-&#xD;
ing no power to cross hwo an-friend's strong will.&#xD;
Upon opening the bureau   wer, only the crape was&#xD;
there. Carlotta nade no remark, but taking it out&#xD;
as if it was the sole object of her attention, she laid&#xD;
it in attractive folds upon the bed, and fetching the&#xD;
bertha, she placed it gossamer-fine' upor it; then the&#xD;
fan and handkerchief; the bouquet-holder ; a pair of&#xD;
tiny white, gloves. The child watched her motions&#xD;
silently, her flushing color coming and going, while&#xD;
her breath wafted unevenly through her parted lips;&#xD;
finally diving into the bottom of the drawer, she&#xD;
fished up the little porte-monnaie, saying gayly:.&#xD;
"Shakespeare advises, 'put money in thy purse.&#xD;
It appears that you have been taking it out of yours.&#xD;
It is as lean as hungry charity."  '&#xD;
"I know it," rejoined Kitty, trying to laugh ;&#xD;
"' who steals my purse steals trash,' but I shall have&#xD;
it full again before long."&#xD;
"Excuse me, darling, but I should like to know&#xD;
what you have done with all your money ; I know&#xD;
you had plenty when you came, and you have bought&#xD;
no expensive articles here."&#xD;
"Now,' Carlie, it's no -use asking me," replied&#xD;

and I know my dear woman-friend won't make me,&#xD;
when she sees that it pains me. It's gone, and, there&#xD;
is an end -of it." -.&#xD;
A little silence ensued, and Carlotta stood thought-"&#xD;
fully -smoothing the folds of the wrinkled cream.,&#xD;
Suddenly shesaid:&#xD;
"EKitty, you shall tell me one thing : Did Belle-&#xD;
Brandon beg, borrow,- buy, or steal your blue&#xD;
satin?"&#xD;
The child, astonished out of her senses, answered,&#xD;
"'Why, Carlie, who told you she-had got it?"&#xD;
"Oh, I heard of it ;. a bird of the air carried the.&#xD;
matter, and.as I do. know -it, you are absolved from&#xD;
your promise of secrecy ; and you shall tell me how&#xD;
she managed it."&#xD;
With the weight off, Kitty most gladly confided&#xD;
the whole story to her woman-friend, adding, "II&#xD;
shall never mention it 'to her again ; I wouldn't take&#xD;
any money of hers, not if she was to go down on, her&#xD;
kneefMd beg me ! "&#xD;
"Well, .child, I won't gainsay you; I see it would&#xD;
be torture to you if I should interfere, so let her&#xD;
keep her ill-gotten gains, and Heaven grant we may -&#xD;
be soon rid of her ! I feel like praying the prayer the&#xD;
old deacon offered for his scolding wife, 'Oh, Lord,&#xD;
let her be speedily and geritly removed.' She is .&#xD;
angling for a queer. fish--such as it is, I think she&#xD;
will get it. One thing. is certain sure, if she does,&#xD;
she receives full reward for all her evil deeds. That&#xD;

you were less innocent, and more selfish  and if that&#xD;
cow-bird can afford to flaunt her borrowed feathers,&#xD;
we can afford to let her. You are not going to be&#xD;
cheated out of this party; I really believe that is just,&#xD;
what the pestilent Fringilla would like, and that is&#xD;
precisely what she can't have; I shall give her to&#xD;

amused attention, thinking "how smart she is," and&#xD;
she soon forgot her vexations in the momentous dis-&#xD;
cussion, and before she knew it she had laughed&#xD;
heartily at Carlotta's .drollery, her grimaces and&#xD;

"Nothing clandestine for me, thank you, Miss Gor-&#xD;

manager, so resolutely marching on her chosen path.&#xD;
Kitty looked up in surprise, and. I must say I was&#xD;

never changed; a bitter thought burned in her heart,&#xD;
though.&#xD;
"Here sits this innocent thing, adored, petted,&#xD;
sheltered, like a bird in a nest, and I am alone, out-&#xD;
side ; she will get a loving young husband. I must&#xD;
take that hideous wretch, or fight poverty, and be an&#xD;
old maid, ugly, wrinkled."  " By faint degrees voice,&#xD;
lute, and pleasure ceased ;.no azure vein wandered on&#xD;
her clear-hued temples, no soft bloom misted the&#xD;
cheek, no passion to illume the deep-recessed vision;&#xD;
all was blight." Belle smiled grimly as Mrs. Ramble&#xD;
opened the door. "It was this horrid old witch&#xD;
which inspired my musing," thought she, "not my&#xD;
speeding future.&#xD;
Time past and time to come are not ;&#xD;
The time present is my only lot.'"&#xD;
The truckman's wife announced that she couldn't&#xD;
"stay a second hardly," and began to talk about the&#xD;
party, forewarning, us in what holiday apparel we&#xD;
should meet our acquaintances.&#xD;
I 'spose you know where. Nickson come from,&#xD;
don't you ?"&#xD;
As Carlotta snapped her eyes, and nobody replied,,&#xD;
I made haste to cover the gap by a negative.&#xD;
"'Why, Roaring. River! leastways he lived there&#xD;

that he was the same one; me and sister Williams&#xD;
hain't been on-the best of terms for quite a spell, .and&#xD;
I didn't go to the weddin' and I didn't go to the&#xD;
funeral; but when Alumzy Jane, was to Toptown,&#xD;
she met her Cousin Payson to Brother Baalam's, and&#xD;
somehow or another she .got hold of the whole story.&#xD;
His first wife was a Wapping from Winchester, and&#xD;
she tried to kill herself three times before they finally&#xD;
found her in the barn hanging to a log chain, her&#xD;
long hair streamin' down behind her, and her eyes&#xD;
sot-and theygot her down just in time to save her&#xD;
from being tried for suicide, and she didn't. live but a&#xD;
couple of days afterwards-and you might know he&#xD;
and poor Mary Ann didn't live a mite happy: they say&#xD;
he beat her ; and anyhow she took her new-born baby&#xD;
and went off one dark night, and she wasn't found&#xD;
till she was as black as your hat, and a'most all to&#xD;
pieces ; and he took leg-bail between two days, or&#xD;
the folks would have mobbed him. I knew all about&#xD;
the poor thing's death before, though they hushed it&#xD;
up ; and now I'm putty ,sure this Nickson is the&#xD;
identical fellar-in fact, I know he is-I meafl to put&#xD;
it to him the very first'chance I get ; they do say he&#xD;
goes by another name. That Knox has been heard&#xD;
to call him Jack Frippon. I can't say nothing about&#xD;
that;, but I do know if he was made of gold and&#xD;
dimuns he ain't no kind of a man to be tied up to.,&#xD;
It's just as true as you live, Belle Brandon.; you'd&#xD;
better let him alone if you know when you're well&#xD;
off. Ramble says I'd better hold my tongue or I'll&#xD;
&#xD;
get took up for slander, but I ain't a mite afraid.&#xD;
He dassent do a thing."&#xD;
Belle was as pale as ashes. Mary Ann Williams&#xD;
had been a schoolmate 'of hers, and there was a,&#xD;
good deal mixed up with her and those' times which&#xD;
was exceedingly disagreeable, and she wondered&#xD;
what portion of her previous history was includedin&#xD;
Payson's gossip ; reflecting that the. fellow was a&#xD;
mere child at the time, she hoped she had escaped&#xD;
mention.  How much of the banker's" story she&#xD;
knew before, or whether this was her first information&#xD;
of ' his connection with her former friends, I never&#xD;
ascertained. I think it quite likely, from her penetra-&#xD;
tion' and -sharpness, that a part of it at least was no&#xD;
news to her. At any rate she haughtily resented&#xD;
Mrs. gamble's interference, and took care to let her&#xD;
know it.&#xD;
"Oh, well: I've done my duty," said the old "lady.&#xD;
" If you want to have a black-leg, pu-gel-ist, hypo-,&#xD;
crite, and what-all, go ahead ; there ain't nobody&#xD;
got no objections; but I tell you if you do, the&#xD;
time'll come when you'll cry right out : 'Oh, that&#xD;
mine head was waters, and mine eyes a fountain of,&#xD;
tears, that I might weep day and night.' You'll rue&#xD;
the day ; mark my words. . As for me, I'd just as&#xD;
soon see you in the Folly as anybody. I was kinder&#xD;
afraid one time that this pretty'-Kitty 'd get took ir,&#xD;

It was really remarkable how the old lady's eyes&#xD;
twinkled whenever they rested on our precious&#xD;
blossom, and what a kindly grin stretched her mouth,&#xD;
displaying: her toothless gums ;. she never had any&#xD;
unpleasant "tells " for her, fruitful js she was in such&#xD;
productions for other people.&#xD;
I think of putting Kitty into Japanese mourning&#xD;
for a want she knows of,'' said Carlotta.&#xD;
"The land sake ! what's that, pray-.--pepper and&#xD;
salt?"&#xD;
"Black and yellow, Mrs. Ramble'; the color of&#xD;
the crow-foot in the meadow or on the banker's face;&#xD;
the hue of the pirate's flag,. 'never say die.' "&#xD;
"How you -do talk, Carlotty; the dog can't make&#xD;
nothing on't out. Oh, good-evening, Mrs. Squirm-&#xD;
well; gain' to prayer-meetin'?"&#xD;
While the others were busy, I had admitted the&#xD;
singing woman, who speedily bore down upon her&#xD;
errand.&#xD;
" I've come in on. purpose to see you, Carlotta.&#xD;
Preparatory lecture is Friday night, and I want to&#xD;
ask your forgiveness,&#xD;
"Indeed, what for--been skipping into my place.&#xD;
somewhere ? "&#xD;
"No, not at all. I know I haven't noticed you as&#xD;
much as I ought to lately, and I want to speak about&#xD;
it before communion, and beg your pardon."&#xD;
"Oh, is that the occasion of your contrite spirit!&#xD;
Well, you may take away my blessing; I assure you&#xD;
I had felt no want of politeness.'&#xD;
&#xD;
*I SIALL BE A -LADY FORE .EP."&#xD;
Whatever reply she might have made was hindered&#xD;
by Winnie, who bounced into the room, forgetting all&#xD;
proprieties, with her cheeks and nose extremely in&#xD;
flamed and the tale of her gown belligerently tucked&#xD;
through her pocket-hole.&#xD;
' Your nasty boy, he's most killed my pig, and you&#xD;
let him, just because he got his poor head catched in&#xD;

well. " Do you expect ever to go to heaven ? if&#xD;
yoi do, I hope the leetle hog '11 go on your back and&#xD;
say ' que, que, que !' all the way."&#xD;
"Why, Winnie, Winnie ! you forget yourself; go&#xD;
out of the room immediately," said I, rising to enforce&#xD;
my command.&#xD;
"I can't help it, Miss Serena. I don't abide that&#xD;
Woman. If she be not the devil, she's the devil's sis-&#xD;

knees in the kitchen and everywheres, prayin' :up to&#xD;

"Wouldn't you like to be forgiven before you go,&#xD;
good woman? "- spoke up Mrs. 'Squirmwell in an ex-&#xD;
alted frame of mid ; " stop a minute, till I offer -a&#xD;
short petition for you."&#xD;
" No, no ! petish yourself, if you feel like it! petish&#xD;

gether afterwards; we. like to -take to our pillows&#xD;
whatever of sweetness or pith we have found, each&#xD;
for herself, in the sacred utterance. The blind mother&#xD;
loved this gathering time, and I notice that the songs&#xD;
we sing oftenest are those she hallowed by her tune-&#xD;
ful voice. Her spirit is among us, I am fond of think-&#xD;
ing; and her heavenly orisons blend with our earthly&#xD;
ones-&#xD;
I happened to be looking at Belle Brandon that&#xD;
evening, while Henry was reading the Scripture les-&#xD;
son. " And thou saidst, I shall be a lady forever, and&#xD;
thou didst not lay these things to heart; neither didst&#xD;
thou consider the latter end of it ; these two things&#xD;
shall come to thee in a moment, in one day, the loss&#xD;
of children and widowhood. . They shall come upon&#xD;
thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sor-&#xD;
ceries and for sthe great abundance of thy enchant-&#xD;
ments."&#xD;
Belle was not over given to deep listening to the&#xD;
Bible-readings, nor self-applications of their promises&#xD;
or threatening ; but this evening her mind was turbid.&#xD;
It sent up the mire and dirt of past follies, sins, trials,&#xD;
mortifications, disappointments--the fruit* of un-&#xD;
worthy actions. When she was sixteen she had a curi-&#xD;
ous experience. Sitting opposite a girl named Chris-&#xD;
tabel Goldsmith, whom she had much tormented, and&#xD;
as deeply wronged as she could, with her opportu-&#xD;
nities, now as then a shudder ran through her veins ;&#xD;
for one instant the present vanished, and she saw her-&#xD;
self in those clear, brown eyes, as in a, mirror; an old,&#xD;
&#xD;
-"I SHALL BE A .,LADY FOREVER."&#xD;
&#xD;
i67&#xD;
&#xD;
ugly, guilt-stained hag;, a polluted creature. Per-&#xD;
haps her guardian angel showed her once more the&#xD;
vision, to save her from the ruin her trickery and false-&#xD;
hood must bring; perhaps it foreshadowed the dreary&#xD;
end: who can say? Now as then she shook herself&#xD;
restlessly, and sent a searching glance into the sur-&#xD;
rounding faces ; she felt as if we 'must have also seen&#xD;
Belle Brandon "no more called tender and delicate,&#xD;
but sitting among the mill-stones grinding the meal,"&#xD;
neglected, ashamed, dragged through dirty ways. If&#xD;
Belle Brandon had a guardian angel he had certainly&#xD;
a most unsatisfactory charge on his hands ; for there&#xD;
never lived a woman who turned more persistently&#xD;
away from all good impulses and holy aspirations,&#xD;
using with obstinate diligence the muck-rake amongst&#xD;
trifles and tricks and sordidness ; she couldn't have&#xD;
seen a crown if.he had held one above her head; and&#xD;
the heavenly glory of a celestial circlet would have&#xD;
attracted none of her regards.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
&#xD;
KITTY VISITS THE QUINCE BUSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
HAT night, after Kitty had gon, to sleep in&#xD;
her white bed, with her pretty curls all tossed&#xD;
on her pillow, Carlotta went softly upstairs,&#xD;
fetched away the crape, and after shutting herself in-&#xD;
to her room, she measured the breadths, and com-&#xD;
menced operations. All the time she could make.&#xD;
from her household duties she .put upon it, and the&#xD;
morning of the party it was ready to try on. Kitty,&#xD;
who enjoyed the secrecy and mystery of the affair&#xD;
hugely, gayly obeyed a signal from her woman-friend&#xD;
to come up from bftakfast andiinally pronounce upon&#xD;
the fit. So, having carefulylocked the door, she was&#xD;
speedily inducted theieir;i aid Went into raptures, and&#xD;
hugged and kissed the maker some scores of times.&#xD;
",Do you know, Carlie," said she, looking thought-&#xD;
fully down at the half-finished, sleeveless garment, with'&#xD;
its basting-threads and ravelled-edges ; " I had such a&#xD;
&#xD;
funny dream last night: I thought I went with you to&#xD;
the party ; I wore a new .dress, but it was the blue&#xD;
satin, and I had curious flowers and ornaments, and I&#xD;
went through long rooms, more beautiful than any-&#xD;
thing I ever beheld; and there, in a great ball-room&#xD;
filled with people, I found a lover, such a pretty fel-&#xD;
low, with curly hair ; and I was so full of joy, and I&#xD;
looked around for you that I might show him to you,&#xD;
and you were gone ; and he also had disappeared,-and&#xD;
there came a man, and said, Why do you weep ? I&#xD;
do not like children who have red eyes. Carlotta is&#xD;
mine ; I have brought her up to my standard, and&#xD;
now I shall take her ; and I was afraid,-and then my&#xD;
papa came, and looked so cross, and scolded me, and&#xD;
Belle Brandon stood close by him, and I tried to tell&#xD;
him something which she hindered me from speaking ;&#xD;
she would not let me look at him, and I awoke, trem-&#xD;
bling; and I could not get rid of it, it seemed so' real&#xD;
and true. -I like nice dreams, but those pokey ones&#xD;
are awful, aren't they?"&#xD;
"You need not trouble yourself to fix up any such&#xD;
destiny for me in the watches of the night. That&#xD;
comes of the stuff I was so silly as to tell you .one&#xD;
day : there won't anybody. bring ine up to any&#xD;
standard ; you see, you had a nightmare, and of&#xD;
course, that cow-bird had to 'thrust herself into it.&#xD;
Heaven forbid such a juxtaposition! What on earth&#xD;
put that into your .head ? has she been. asking you&#xD;
questions about your father?" inquired Carlotta sus-&#xD;

"Oh yes; we have talked a good deal, and I sent&#xD;
him her picture when she first came."&#xD;
"Her picture! what for, pray ?"&#xD;
" Oh nothing : she told me to, and I asked him to&#xD;
come on this summer ; I knew he wouldn't, for all she&#xD;
thought I could coax him; and he won't," said Kitty&#xD;
sorrowfully.&#xD;
" Good Lord, deliver. us from all these---cow-&#xD;
birds.! " ejaculated Carlotta not very reverently. Her&#xD;
utterance was something difficult, too, for she had-her&#xD;
mouth full of 'pins. "I only hope I can get this&#xD;
skirt to hang," she added, frowningly twitching it.&#xD;
"He had better stay where he is, if he knows when&#xD;
he's well off."&#xD;
" What do you mean, Carlie ? why do you say hem&#xD;
of my crape."&#xD;
"A confusion of genders consequent upon my&#xD;
French studies," answered Carlotta.&#xD;
It is such fun getting ready on the sly, isn't it?'&#xD;
And Belle thinks I will stay, at home ; won't she look&#xD;
astonished when I come_ in leaning on my woman-&#xD;
friend's arm ? Oh' Carlie, I wish we could find -our&#xD;
lovers up there ; I want a lover ; don't you ? "&#xD;
"No ! child, no ! of course not; what should I do&#xD;
with a dangling fool?"&#xD;
"Why, marry him, pet him, kiss him, like this and&#xD;

Well, child, that may suit your salad days. I'm&#xD;
no longer green in judgment. I forswear all such&#xD;

my neck. I shall have to work like steam to get fin-&#xD;
ished in season, and I want to make time to wash my&#xD;
best collar, which Henry brought me from Brussels,&#xD;
and to clean my gloves."&#xD;
" Let mne wash your collar, Carlotta."&#xD;
" Nonsense! pet ! as if I would trust you. I don't&#xD;
believe laundry-work was taught at your school ; go&#xD;
and find Jim, and have a little romp, and keep your&#xD;
bright looks, or you may miss the pretty fellow,&#xD;
which would be a pity."&#xD;
" You shall wear- a. pair of my gloves, any way ;&#xD;
promise that, or I won't stir. See, your hand fits mine,&#xD;
finger to finger; only your first and middle ones are&#xD;
just the same length, and that is a sign you will&#xD;
rule your husband. Laura Gwin told me so, oh&#xD;
Carlie!"&#xD;
" Well, I have as full a right to rule as be ruled,&#xD;
if it comes to that," answered Carlotta; "you must&#xD;
go now, pet," she added quickly.&#xD;
" Not till you promise," persisted Kitty; "no&#xD;
gloves, no g&#xD;
" As you please, precious," said Carlotta, kissing&#xD;
the sweet face raised to her. Putting her favorite&#xD;
,from the room she locked the door. I' believe she&#xD;
sewed many thoughts into the dress that morning-.&#xD;
thoughts kindled by Kitty's artless prattle. I feel&#xD;
sure of it, because when I visited her room seeking a&#xD;
brooch of mine, I found her busy with a box of let-&#xD;
,ters-so busy that I had to knock thrice- before she&#xD;
admitted me-; and there was a certain exaltation&#xD;

about her face, a lithe grace to her motions, which I&#xD;
remembered well in the old days of her friendship&#xD;
with. Pitkin Sterling: and moreover, she had turned&#xD;
her raven tresses back in deep braids, and pierced&#xD;
them with the golden arrow. Once a year she did this.&#xD;
I cannot tell how I knew, but I did know, she had&#xD;
worn it thus the evening when he had asked her to&#xD;
marry him. I loved her too well to intrude any com-&#xD;
ments upon actions on which she desired to keep&#xD;
silence; but she is one~-of those rare creatures one&#xD;
cannot help studying, all whose phases are full of&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
Our lawyer was at court. I was presiding over&#xD;
Winnie's currant jelly, and-too busy to dine, and&#xD;
Carlotta took her green tea, salad, and rolls in her&#xD;
apartment, being pressed for time, and also perhaps&#xD;
choosing her own thoughts to any society. So the&#xD;
two girls sat down to the table by themselves. They&#xD;
had hardly spoken together since the talk at the gate.&#xD;
In fact, Miss; Brandon had passed most of her time&#xD;
in Miss Snuffandbark's workroom, going out each&#xD;
morning with a little basket on her arm directly after&#xD;
breakfast, and returning late: She did not dare in-&#xD;
trust her costume to the tender mercies of the country&#xD;
artist, but directed and planned Ahe whole toutedn&#xD;
scramble" (to use a favorite phrase of the dress--&#xD;
maker), and assisted with her own fingers, made&#xD;
skilful b'y adroit practice. So we had our Red Cot-&#xD;
tage very much to ourselves.&#xD;
Little Kitty had done her best to forget and for-&#xD;
&#xD;
give, but, she did not feel like being especially so-&#xD;
ciable, and as for the blonde, she looked down&#xD;
on "the chit," as a means, an instrument, wholly&#xD;
devoid of interest, except so far as she could be made&#xD;
available, "a poor, spiritless little tool "-and as she&#xD;
had not yet gotten all she needed out of the "tool,"&#xD;
she was glad of the opportunity the solitary dining&#xD;
gave her to achieveher design.&#xD;
"I declare, Mignonne," .she broke out, "I do feel&#xD;
so annoyed ! I have the greatest mind not to go to&#xD;
the party, after.all.&#xD;
"Why not? " replied Kitty, pleasantly, in whom&#xD;
the familiar tones and epithets awakened the old train&#xD;
of feeling.&#xD;
"Because I cannot find a decent thing to put on&#xD;
my head in this dull town, Robin Gray. I wanted&#xD;
marabouts, and there isn't one to be had for love nor&#xD;
money. I do think after all the unpleasant feelings&#xD;
I have been through, and the trouble and worry,&#xD;
and the misunderstandings with my dear friend--''&#xD;
"Why not wear flowers ? Carlotta will give you&#xD;
plenty ; make a wreath."&#xD;
" You 'dear,. unsophisticated innocent! do you&#xD;
suppose .I would appear in  garden flowers at a full-&#xD;
dress party? Certainly not !&#xD;
Kitty looked amazed, remembering Belle's offer&#xD;
to construct a garland for her use from the despised&#xD;
blossoms, but did not say anything.&#xD;
"I suppose you wouldn't like to do me a favor,&#xD;
Kitty, if I should ask it ? You have hardly spoken&#xD;

or looked at me this whole week" (this in a gushing,&#xD;
tender tone). "You can't know how unhappy you&#xD;
have made me ! If I had for a moment supposed&#xD;
such a trifle could have broken our friendship, I&#xD;
would have jumped into the Dead Sea before I would&#xD;
have touched that dress ; and I was so fond of you: I&#xD;
never met a girl in whom I took so warm an interest.&#xD;
The ants don't prize their aphides more than I prize&#xD;
you." (Belle laughed inside ; she knew she was safe&#xD;
in simple Kitty's "Natural History.") "I hoped we.&#xD;
should be life-friends. I am the most unlucky-creat-&#xD;
ure ! always saying and doing outri things. I do&#xD;
think it is too hard. I don't see what I was born&#xD;
for!"&#xD;
&#xD;
If Belle had put her exclamation into the form of&#xD;
a riddle, Kitty might have replied as. did the boy to&#xD;
a certain lady-lecturer: "Gives that up ; ask some&#xD;
more hard questions ; " .but seeing that the blonde's&#xD;
handkerchief was at her eyes, and she was getting up&#xD;
quite a rush of sobs, the poor child felt as if she&#xD;
must be personally accountable, and wickedly to&#xD;
blame somehow for' the torrent of grief, and made&#xD;
haste to speak such words of comfort as she could sum-&#xD;
mon in her.embarrassment ; and was finally induced,&#xD;
by half ejaculations, and incomplete confessions, to&#xD;
inquire what was the favor she desired, but feared to&#xD;
name ; going mentally, at the same time, over such&#xD;
possessions of hers as she thought it probable Belle&#xD;
might be-most likely to beg or borrow.&#xD;

eyes and sweetly smiling. "I did wish very much to&#xD;
have some cape jessamines for my hair.; but it is of no&#xD;
consequence. I did think, as you were not going to&#xD;
this stupid Foll.--though I must say I consider you&#xD;
too hasty in t at decision" (she speeded on as she&#xD;
noticed an an ry flush mounting in Kitty's cheek ;&#xD;
and it was no part of her plan to provoke her now),&#xD;
"and you are ;so fond of country rambles-quite a&#xD;
walkist, in fact, you might enjoy a stroll up to Miss&#xD;
Walsingham's to bring me some. Her place is look-&#xD;

you were .going, I could make a lovely breast-knot&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
. Kitty, in her astonishment, cane near.-letting out&#xD;
Carlotta's grand secret, and declaring that she was&#xD;
going ; but she checked herself in time,&#xD;
"Miss Walsingham's ! " she exclaimed. "Why,&#xD;
Belle,,you are surely wild. It is one o'clock now ; I&#xD;
don't believe I could go and get back in time ; it must&#xD;
be a good two miles. Besides, her nephew is ex-&#xD;

each word, and the child felt that she was behaving&#xD;
in a perfectly selfish, unprincipled manner under their&#xD;
Geraldine influence.&#xD;
Oh, do pray stop there ; don't prolong the agony&#xD;
needlessly. You are determined to be disobliging,&#xD;
and that is the upshot of it. 'Anything else !'-but&#xD;
there isn't anything else. I am resolved not to stir&#xD;
one-step to that party unless I have some cape jessa-&#xD;
mines. I should hate to feel that I had spoiled a&#xD;
friend's pleasure just for.paltry laziness ! "&#xD;
( Pushing -away her chair, she fell on to the sofa, in&#xD;
a state of mind, and buried her head in its cushions,&#xD;
and moaned andsobbed.&#xD;
" Oh dear me !- I'm perfectly miserable ! all alone&#xD;
in this unfeeling world. I wish - I was dead and&#xD;
buried out of everybody's way ! "&#xD;
Crushed as she was, with grief, Lord Feigning's&#xD;
daughter managed to lift her face enough 'to get a&#xD;
peep at Kitty's countenance. The sorrowful conster-&#xD;
nation painted there looked encouraging, and she&#xD;
continued:&#xD;
Oh, Kitty, Cherie! I don't feel as if I was long&#xD;
for this world" (" only five feet sixinches," she inly&#xD;
interpolated); "and I have had a hard time ; I have&#xD;
a presentiment that I shall die young. I am not strong,&#xD;
but.I should like to know that somebody would think&#xD;
about yme after I am gone. Will you drop a tear to&#xD;
poor 'Belle's memory ? One tear is all I ask (I am&#xD;
sure that is modest of me). Think of her who loved&#xD;
you, Mignonne, when you are happy."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Pray don't, Belle ! " said Kitty, starting up ner-&#xD;
vously. "I'll go ; if cape jessamines will keep you&#xD;
alive, you shall have some."  Kitty could not- help&#xD;
laughing in spite of her.distress ; but the merriment&#xD;
was so hysterical, that tears would have come just as&#xD;
easily. She tied on her sun-bonnet and looked at the&#xD;
clock. She was a'good walker;- but she dreaded the&#xD;
burning sun, which was pouring down its hottest on&#xD;
the dustyjroad. " I'll just run up and tell Carlotta-&#xD;
where I am going ; she might want me."&#xD;
Belle. raised her head and said quite sharply, for&#xD;
one so crushed by grief, "Ifyou mean to proclaim it&#xD;
on the house-top, I had rather you didn't go at ill.&#xD;
I do despise such a fuss about every trifle ! "&#xD;
Kitty, who had her hand on the knob, feeling her-&#xD;
self thus hemmed' in, turned back without another&#xD;
word. When Belle saw her safely through the gate,&#xD;
the pink sun-bonnet which Carlotta had manufac-&#xD;
tured amidst much mirth, to accompany the Peck-&#xD;
sniffian costurne, drawn over her face, she laughed a&#xD;
laugh of mean, selfish triumph.&#xD;
"There goes the most miserable fool ! I wonder&#xD;
if there could be an inducement offered to me, which&#xD;
would take me out two miles under this broiling sun,&#xD;
to oblige my best-that is, my most useful friend.&#xD;

my soul. I came exceeding near being a relation of&#xD;
hers once ; heigho ! I am really getting old ! "&#xD;
Suddenly starting up, she ran nimbly after her&#xD;
messenger, who was speeding on her way,&#xD;
"Stop one instant, Mignonne; let me speak one&#xD;
word."&#xD;
Kitty turned about without looking up, and waited&#xD;
for her.&#xD;
"As. you are not going this evening, I may as&#xD;
well borrow your fan and other things. God bless&#xD;
you, Cherie ! I shall never forget how kind you are&#xD;
to me. My head feels better already. Maybe it&#xD;
will be my turn one of these fine days. I'll have you&#xD;
up to the Folly to spend the summer, when I marry&#xD;
the banker. There ! hurry on for your own Belle!"&#xD;
Giving "the chit " a little push and a kiss, she&#xD;
ran back to the house with her handkerchief over her&#xD;
face. Though -the heat was so oppressive, and the&#xD;
scorched roadway deep in hot, red dust, she felt no&#xD;
pity, but floated up to the Blue Corner, humming&#xD;
"Angels ever bright and fair," which she did so&#xD;
exquisitely-in such delicate, thrilling voice, rich in&#xD;
pathos, tender in purity, that Carlotta opened her&#xD;
door to listen, and Winnie crossed herself in the&#xD;
kitchen, and muttered an "Ave," feeling that there&#xD;
must be a need for a little extra praying; and was&#xD;
not quite at ease-till the fair warbler had hushed her&#xD;
notes, having concentrated her attention upon putting.&#xD;
her complexion into almond paste, to enhance its&#xD;
brilliance for t1e evening.&#xD;

ITTY plodded along with tearful eyes. Her&#xD;
cheerful, forgiving nature rose up afresh&#xD;
against Belle ; she felt, though she could not&#xD;
resist, all her exactions and extortions. As for the_&#xD;
party, she would have given it up altogether, if Car-&#xD;
lotta had not taken so much trouble about it. Then&#xD;
remembering her dress, and the good times they had&#xD;
enjoyed during its fabrication, and her odd dream,&#xD;
she fell to speculating about the dancing, and won-&#xD;
dered whom she would have for partners; what she&#xD;
would wear in her bosom, and how she should look ;&#xD;
what Henry- would think ; what the wonderful&#xD;
Archie would say to her, and if his hair curled ; if&#xD;
he really would be there ; and by the time' she&#xD;
reached the Quince Bush, her elastic spirit was&#xD;
bright again, and her pretty face was serenely cleared&#xD;
of all shadow.&#xD;

180        THE OGRESS' CASTLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OGRESS' CASTLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a lovely spot. Though dead level, like all&#xD;
the surrounding country, it had been brought into&#xD;
such a state of perfect cultivation, and so tastefully&#xD;
laid out, that. the eye felt no want in looking over it;&#xD;
and Kitty took off her bonnet and sacque, and sat&#xD;
down upon the broad door-stone to admire and get&#xD;
cool, before she -asked admittance. Her hair fell in&#xD;
damp curls all over her plump neck, so fair and full ;&#xD;
and her flushed cheeks, and dimpled, round arms&#xD;
crossed over her lap in a pretty, old-fashioned, child-&#xD;
ish way, made her as bonnie a picture as you might&#xD;
see on a summer's day. A couple of very youthful&#xD;
puppies of the Retriever family, who in their baby-&#xD;
hood showed the marks of their parentage, having&#xD;
the wide Newfoundland muzzle, and long, silky ears,&#xD;
and well-lined face of the Irish setter mother ; and&#xD;
the thick, glossy, black fur, long and curly, so neces-&#xD;
sary to a perfect Retriever, were rolling over each&#xD;
other on the lawn, and Kitty laughed heartily at their&#xD;
clumsy gambols ; which laugh suddenly subsided&#xD;
as the hall-door opened, and a stout woman in&#xD;
rustling silk, who had been attentively watching. her&#xD;
from the, window, accosted her in a full voice, as if&#xD;
she had always lived in the open air, and taken in no&#xD;
end' of oxygen or ozone, or some other vitalizer,&#xD;
which made Kitty start quickly to her feet. She&#xD;
just glanced upward, meeting bright, black, penetra-.&#xD;
tive, eyes, which seemed to search her inmost soul,&#xD;
and made her drop her own, culprit-fashion, upon&#xD;
the ground.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Are you trying to catch a cold and a fever, child,&#xD;
that you sit there unsacqued, with the wind blowing&#xD;
on your bare arms ?"&#xD;
" Oh no,. indeed, ma'am ; I was watching the&#xD;
dogs," replied Kitty, hurriedly.&#xD;
"And have you come. to Quince Bush to admire&#xD;
my dogs ? they ought to feel flattered by the atten-&#xD;
tion. You see their mother is doing her best to show&#xD;
her gratitude. If her chain were not a strong one,&#xD;
she would be thrusting her cold nose against that&#xD;
hot-cheek of yours, and that would frighten you."&#xD;
" I am not afraid of dogs," replied Kitty with&#xD;
marked emphasis, still looking down.&#xD;
"Oh, and you are afraid of me, for instance-and&#xD;
yet you have invaded my domain."&#xD;
" Yes, ma'am, I had to-I have come begging-&#xD;
and. I may as well get it over first as last. I want&#xD;
some flowers."&#xD;
She preferred her request in a timid voice, with&#xD;
bowed head, and her small hands tightly clasped&#xD;
together: had she been suing for .a brother's life,&#xD;
another Isabella, she-could not have sembled a more&#xD;
trembling suppliant. Miss Elinor Walsingham, for it&#xD;
was our old friend, looked down at the child in a&#xD;
curious, admiring, amused way ; but when she spoke,&#xD;
it was in the same full-volumed voice.&#xD;
- "Do you suppose, little one, that I grow hot-&#xD;
house flowers to supply all'Christendom, that you&#xD;
come and batter at my door so boldly, and demand&#xD;
them?"&#xD;
&#xD;

182         THE OGRESS' CASTLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
She smiled to herself at the idea of boldness, in the&#xD;
modest, shrinking figure before her.&#xD;
"Indeed, I do not," replied poor Kitty, ready to&#xD;
drop ; "I could not .bear to ask for your jessamines;&#xD;
I never ask for anything. I told Belle I should be&#xD;
horribly afraid of you, but she would make me come ;&#xD;
she said she should die; she always does make me&#xD;
do what she wishes, Ican not help it, and I am glad it&#xD;
is over with, and I'll go right home. I ought not&#xD;
to have sat down on your door-steps, but I was so hot&#xD;
and tired, and I just wanted to rest and look at the&#xD;
puppies."&#xD;
She hurriedly picked itp her sun-bonnet and&#xD;
sacque, and turned away. Aunt Elinor burst into a&#xD;
laugh loud and hearty, and'full of good humor.&#xD;
" You're a cunning little sprite,"'said she, "and as&#xD;
pretty a child asI have seen for many a day."&#xD;
Kitty raised her eyes at the pleasant sound, and&#xD;
looked in the face of the laugher.&#xD;
" You are not angry, then, after all; I thought you.&#xD;
meant to scold meIfor intruding, and send me off.-&#xD;
and such a walk as I have had!"&#xD;
"And did you take me for an ogress, who eats&#xD;
children, that you trembled and blushed at such a&#xD;
rate? Do I look like one ? Come, that's right, full.&#xD;
and frank; I like faces that will bear daylight, yours&#xD;
is as clearas a crystal brook ; so you, told Belle that'&#xD;
you would be afraid of me ; am I so awesome a&#xD;
sight ? "&#xD;
"Now you are laughing at me, Miss Walsingham;&#xD;
&#xD;
but you spoke so loud ; I always am afraid of people&#xD;
who talk loud."&#xD;
":Come, then, I'll whisper mild as a sucking dove ;&#xD;
I can't have such a tender little chick afraid of me."&#xD;
She reached down and softly took Kitty's hand,&#xD;
and drew her inside, and shut the door; "no, not&#xD;
even, when a close- prisoner in my keep?  You see&#xD;
an, ogress is good-humored, when she isn't hungry,&#xD;
and I shall not eat you ; I am not like the con-&#xD;
verted feejee Islander, who desired, when very ill,&#xD;
to partake of a bit of baked pickaninny-I prefer&#xD;
chickens.1"&#xD;
" How. horrid!" exclaimed Kitty; "I suppose&#xD;
pickaninny means baby-dreadful old -cannibal ! "&#xD;
"Yes; the ruling- passion strong in death, you&#xD;
know-do you tremble severely ? "&#xD;
"Don't make fun of a poor stranger," said Kitty ;&#xD;
"I like you very much-you are merry, and I think&#xD;
you are handsome, and ever so friendly."&#xD;
"Oh, do you ? very,, well then ; sit here in the&#xD;
breeze and. get cool, and we will have in some iced&#xD;
lemonade, and sponge' cakes, while we talk about&#xD;
this jessamine ,business ; so you hated to come, did&#xD;
you ? I should think so, through this burning heat ;&#xD;
it was enough to wilt such a little blushing bud.&#xD;
How far have you. walked ? from the village, I sup-&#xD;
pose ; I thought I knew all the lasses about me, but&#xD;
your fresh, dear, charming face is a new one."&#xD;

"The Gortons! ah--indeed ! and what is your&#xD;
name, my dove?"&#xD;
Just then a huge cat jumped in at the window ;&#xD;
and Kitty seized upon her before she answered. "I&#xD;
am called Kitty Clayton, but I believe my true name&#xD;
is Katrina Augusta."&#xD;
A quick change passed over the hostess' face, a&#xD;
spasm of pain, and she silently observed they little&#xD;
figure before her. The bent head so childish fair;&#xD;
the soft, dimpled hands, busy with caressing motions.&#xD;
When she was young and beautiful, she rejected&#xD;
lovers for this maid's father, and because she could&#xD;
never, root out from her breast his image, she had&#xD;
lived single and alone all these years, and she looked&#xD;
yearningly at the child ; but soon rising briskly, she&#xD;
brushed back her - memories as she did her silken&#xD;
skirts.&#xD;
"I hate to cut my flowers ; they are only for my&#xD;
friends, and the friends of my friends' friends-"&#xD;
I was sure you would," broke in Kitty. "I&#xD;
would. wear dandelions in my hair before I would ask&#xD;
such a favor ; but Belle would make me come."&#xD;
"tAnd you love Belle very much?"&#xD;
" No, I do not love her; but she knows how to&#xD;
win her way. She got my Blue Corner ; she gets&#xD;
all she wants."&#xD;
"She is not7 your sister, or you would not so&#xD;
frankly confess to a want of affection-who ,then is&#xD;
she ? "&#xD;
"She is Belle Brandon."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Belle Brandon? I have heard that name before.&#xD;
I wonder if it is the same ; how does she look ? "&#xD;
" Oh, beautiful ; long curls and blue eyes."&#xD;
How old is she ? "                       -&#xD;
"I don't know-pretty old ; I should think as&#xD;
much as twenty-two /&#xD;
Aunt Elinor laughed. "Do you call that old ?&#xD;
Why I am forty-seven.&#xD;
"Oh, I mean old for a girl."&#xD;
"But I am a girl."&#xD;
" No. .You are a woman."&#xD;
"But when does a maid cease to be a girl, and&#xD;
commence her womanhood, according to your&#xD;
idea ?"&#xD;
" When she leaves off wishing for lovers, and set-&#xD;
ties down to her life with something to do, and thinks&#xD;
no longer- about being married. ^Carlotta says she&#xD;
isn't a girl any more, and she told me that was the&#xD;
reason. Has your cat got any name ? He's a hand-&#xD;
some fellow, like a lion, with his yellow stripes and&#xD;
pale eyes, golden as the ochre we used to have among&#xD;
our paints at school."&#xD;
"He is named Lion-you have hit the nail on ,the&#xD;
head with your little hammer. He knows who he&#xD;
likes, and why he likes ; here comes our lemonade.&#xD;
Now 'drink, pretty creature, drink.' "&#xD;
"Thank you," said Kitty. " I used to say those&#xD;
verses at Madame Devereaux's."&#xD;
"And so you are Paul Clayton's daughter! Do&#xD;

daughter ?  I knew your papa when I was a wee&#xD;
lassie ; he carried my dinner-basket when I went to&#xD;
school. I left off being a girl, according to your reck-&#xD;
oning, when I was nineteen, and have been an old&#xD;
dame ever since. You are like your father, too. I&#xD;
should think I would have known you ; you have his&#xD;
eyes. Ah ! how well I remember that look."&#xD;
She rose and walked out' of the room, and when&#xD;
she came back, her nose was red ; and she held a&#xD;
great bunch of jessamines carefully tied in wet paper.&#xD;
" These are all for you ;. mind, they are for Paul&#xD;
Clayton's daughter. You may give them away, if&#xD;
you choose ; but I cut them because you asked me."&#xD;
"Oh, yes ; I must give them to Belle; she sent&#xD;
me out here, you know ; and besides, I am to wear&#xD;
some of Carlotta's ivy this evening."&#xD;
"Very well; just as you like ; but you must stop&#xD;
awhile and talk to me, to pay me for cutting them."&#xD;
Kitty, nothing loath, curled comfortably into the&#xD;
sofa corner, and coaxed Lion to make a ball of him-&#xD;
self in her lap... She began to prattle in her quaint&#xD;
fashion, while her hostess sat erect in front of her,&#xD;
drinking in her looks and words with admiration for&#xD;
her, and many thoughts of her own lost youth ; see-&#xD;
ing herself 'in Kitty's bright eyes as in a mirror-at&#xD;
gay little maid like her, fresh, careless, and loving.&#xD;
In answer to her hostess' questions, Kitty gave a&#xD;
simple account of herself; her school life, her visit at&#xD;
the Red Cottage; and finally branched off on to&#xD;
the party, and confided to her amused listener that&#xD;
&#xD;
one great reason she hated coming to the Quince&#xD;
Bush, was a fear that she might meet Archie Laurie,&#xD;
of whom she had heard so much.&#xD;
" Do you know, ma'am ?" said she confidentially,&#xD;
curling Lion's tail.&#xD;
"Aunt Elinor, darling; I want you to take me&#xD;
for your auntie," said Miss Wilsingham leaning for-&#xD;
ward, and giving to the bright-colored face a little&#xD;
squeeze.&#xD;
"How nice to have an auntie ! I shall like that.&#xD;
There wasa girl at our school who was so queer ; one&#xD;
day she came along with an open letter in her hand,&#xD;
and smiled, and said, 'My aunt is dead ;' and wecould&#xD;
not help laughing, because she announced the news as&#xD;
if she were speaking of a fete, and then a little while&#xD;
after we found her crying bitterly in a corner, and&#xD;
when we asked her 'why ?' she said, 'Oh dear, my&#xD;
poor aunt was only ninety-five ;- I don't see why she&#xD;
couldn't have -lived to be a hundred. I did so want&#xD;
an aunt that was a hundred ; and now I haven't -a&#xD;
single one left, except six of papa's sisters.'"&#xD;
" Kitty, Kitty, you are a bit of a rogue, I see ; you&#xD;
mustn't make fun of people's foibles ; it is a bad&#xD;
habit."&#xD;
"I don't, auntie, never. I don't like it myself-I&#xD;
think it hurts."&#xD;
"Yes, and it hurts the fun-maker more than the&#xD;
subject of the ridicule. What was it you were-about&#xD;

Laurie must be something like Prince Almanazar in&#xD;
'Brazen-Gates."'&#xD;
Is that so, my dear," asked Miss Walsingham, with&#xD;
a little laugh, and a side glance at the open window';&#xD;
" and why, pray? "&#xD;
"Because I think about him as .Cousin H4enry&#xD;
speaks of him ; his good heart, his bravery and s'wveet-&#xD;
ness. The Prince was that way, you know ; but per-&#xD;
haps you don't read fairy stories."&#xD;
" Not often in these old dame days; but there are&#xD;
a few that-are worth the trouble ; nd this little tale&#xD;
happens to be by a dear friend, so of course I have.&#xD;
read it from cover to cover."&#xD;
" Don't you think he was a nice lover? I want a&#xD;
lover; Belle has had ever so many, and I haven't&#xD;
had a single one yet."&#xD;
Miss Walsingham cast a sharp glance at the child&#xD;
after this speech, wondering how much there might&#xD;
be under this simple surface. Kitty was looking in&#xD;
her eyes, and; her sweet, clear-cut face was so child--&#xD;
ishly frank and pleasant, that she cast away what-&#xD;
ever thought of guile or boldness had been obtruding&#xD;
itself, and answered her in almost the same words&#xD;
Carlotta had used :'&#xD;
"Oh, wait a bit, darling; you'll get plenty."&#xD;
"Yes, perhaps so. That's what they all say ; but&#xD;
I don't see any coming about."&#xD;
'll give you leave to take Archie, if he develops&#xD;
as well as you anticipate."&#xD;
" Has he come? Is he here? Will he be there ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"He is not visible to the naked eye, you see ; he.&#xD;
arrived in town this morning. You need not flutter&#xD;
like a little dove-you are safe from him at present.&#xD;
I think he will be at the party, though. I shall cer-&#xD;
tainly give him his invitation, and instructions.".&#xD;
"That will be nice. I am ever so glad I came. I'm&#xD;
cool now. I'll come up and spend the -day ; can't I ?&#xD;
It was lucky I did not meet Archie; which road will&#xD;
he take ? I should hate to be seen in this crumpled&#xD;
muslin, and my curls all frizzed up. I hope he will&#xD;
ask me for the first dance. Does he know all the&#xD;
girls ? I hope I shall see him ,before Belle.does.&#xD;
Don't you tell, will you? I should like to show you&#xD;
my dress. It is lovely."  Here followed a full and&#xD;
particular description of the crape, its style and fit;&#xD;
to all of which her hostess lent pleased ears, bending&#xD;
toward her from time to time for a little pat of the&#xD;
round cheek, or a caress of the abundant hair, her&#xD;
manner full of lovingness.&#xD;
"But how does it happen, dear auntie, that I have&#xD;
not seen you at the Red Cottage, since you are such&#xD;
a friend of the Gortons ?"&#xD;
"I have been at Bladen Springs, my dear; I only&#xD;
returned last Friday. Serena came to see me the&#xD;
day I left. I remember she spoke of guests; but she&#xD;
could not' have mentioned your name. I should&#xD;
surely have noted that.&#xD;
" I believe I. knew you were gone, too, auntie, but I&#xD;
didn't think about it, because I had not adopted you&#xD;

"Yes, I suppose so; but mine are not, and I must&#xD;

great deal better than he deserves."&#xD;
&#xD;
Aunt Elinor finished her speech with a frown;&#xD;
she was evidently talking, not to Kitty, but herself,&#xD;
and possibly to a third person, who did not appear.&#xD;
On the soft grass beneath the window lay lazily&#xD;
stretched at full length a well-knit, healthy, hearty fel-&#xD;
low, who glanced merrily houseward and smiled before&#xD;
resuming his occupation, viz.: watching the fleecy,&#xD;
sailing clouds, and puffing a long cigar.&#xD;
"Why don't you mother your boy harder, auntie,&#xD;
and make him mind you and behave ?" asked Kitty,&#xD;
smiling. She felt the abundant sweetness and strength&#xD;
which enveloped the'lady like an atmosphere, and the&#xD;
native way in which she showed it mightily pleased&#xD;
Miss Walsingham.&#xD;
" An excellent suggestion, dear. I shall certainly&#xD;
adopt it."&#xD;
Kitty was just about to put a very important ques-&#xD;
tion. She was going to ask, "Is Archie handsome?&#xD;
dpes his hair curl?" but the great hall clock tolled&#xD;
out five, and in such sonorous, commanding tones as&#xD;
to compel attention, and.she jumped up in a mighty&#xD;
hurry, and pushing away Lion, began to tie on her&#xD;
bonnet.&#xD;
"Oh dear I! how late it is ! I have stopped too long ;&#xD;
how I. do wish I could fly, or go home in a fairy&#xD;
chariot, or a balloon; any way to. get rid of that aw-&#xD;
ful walk in the hot."&#xD;
" Perhaps you would like to meet Prince Almana-&#xD;
zar on'-his winged horse."&#xD;
"No, I don't know as I should ; he loved Lady&#xD;

Delight. I am only simple Kitty. I must have a&#xD;
lover who isn't too wise for me.'!&#xD;
"One who can batter down the brazen gates, hey ?&#xD;
I know a young puppy who -is' full of conceit that he*&#xD;
is able to accomplish anything. Well, let him go&#xD;
ahead and try ; I've-got through talking."&#xD;
"Now, auntie, I-know you mean Archie, but don't&#xD;
old me, please. You know I hate to have my peo-&#xD;
ple talk loud. When he comes he must do as you&#xD;
want4Ito have him.  I shall help you keep him in&#xD;
order."&#xD;
Miss Walsingham laughed and gave the maid a good&#xD;
squeeze. '"My pretty dove," said she, ''I am&#xD;
glad you came; you have done me good. You'shall&#xD;
have the key of the Ogress' castle ; it isn't every child&#xD;
I'd have pattering about my place, but I love you. I&#xD;
gave up general society long ago. I live nowadays&#xD;
amongst my pigs and poultry. I hadn't the remotest&#xD;
idea of going to that festin this evening, but now that&#xD;
you have told me so much about it, I seem to smell&#xD;
the battle afar off, and I think I will don 'my war&#xD;
paint and 'feathers,' and appear in the arena. I must&#xD;
make an effort ; you know Fanny Dombey died for&#xD;
want of an effort. Look out sharp for the lover,&#xD;
Prince Almanazar or Archie; and, my darling, I am&#xD;
going to send you a nice bouquet ; you shall accept it&#xD;
for the sake of Paul Clayton, who used to carry my-&#xD;
dinner-basket. Now don't walk too fast, and don't&#xD;
get run over by any wild lads driving by."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Kitty kissed her hostess in her fond, nestling fash-&#xD;
ion, and with many thanks for her kindness, she&#xD;
started on her homeward way, delighted with her new&#xD;
auntie and her visit.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
PRINCE ALMANAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT.&#xD;
HE burning air seemed to simmer. The&#xD;
-breeze had died entirely away when Kitty&#xD;
reached' the brook, about a quarter of a mile&#xD;
walk ; she felt too tired to go on, and quite overcome&#xD;
by the heat, seating herself under the spreading&#xD;
beech-tree, which stretched its long arms half way&#xD;
across the merry stream, she bathed her hot face and&#xD;
hands in the cool, rippling water, and then leaning&#xD;
back against the 'rough tree trunk, she 'began to go&#xD;
musingly .over the events of her afternoon. She&#xD;
gazed dreamily out of half-shut eyes at the fiery scar-&#xD;
let dragon-flies and royal purple demoiselles, flitting&#xD;
and darting hither and. thither over the stream, and&#xD;
listened to the locusts singing above her, and the&#xD;
frogs croaking among the rushes, until somehow the&#xD;
&#xD;
PRINCE -ALMANAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT 195&#xD;
bunch of flowers dropped from her limp grasp, her&#xD;
eyelids fell, and pretty, foolish Kitty Clayton was&#xD;
fast asleep upon the king's highway.&#xD;
A sound of wheels crunching the gravel aroused&#xD;
her; and a young man with clear, ruddy face, which&#xD;
just now wore a look of amused admiration, seemed&#xD;
to have been watering his horse in the ford, for he&#xD;
stood beside the animal adjusting its harness.&#xD;
I do believe I have been asleep ! " exclaimed&#xD;
Kitty, starting up, surprised into the exclamation, and&#xD;
scarcely knowing where she was.&#xD;
" I am quite sure of it," replied the young gentle-&#xD;
man, as if the remark was addressed to him, and de-&#xD;
manded a reply. " When I drove down the road&#xD;
just now, you were as fast as little Bo-peep when she&#xD;
lost her sheep, you remember ? "&#xD;
" Oh yes, I know all about the small shepherdess;&#xD;
she was an early friend of mine," replied Kitty, laugh-&#xD;
ing with easy frankness, and picking up the fallen&#xD;
flowers, while she shaded her eyes with her hands.&#xD;
" Dear ! how low the sun is! I shall have to hurry&#xD;
dreadfully ; and how cross Belle will be ! "&#xD;
"Perhaps you will allow me the distinguished&#xD;
honor of setting you down at home, as I am going&#xD;
your way."&#xD;
" Oh are you, indeed ! pray how do you happen&#xD;
to know which way I am going? you may take me,&#xD;
though, if you are passing through Merry Bank.&#xD;
Your horse heads that way, I see; I am sure I am&#xD;
tired enough to be carried."&#xD;
&#xD;

"That is omniurn in totem; then please. come up&#xD;
into the chariot, etc."&#xD;
" Do I want to, be toted? yes ; haven't, I just in-&#xD;
sinuated as much?"&#xD;
Both laughed good-humoredly; he assisted' her to&#xD;
her place in the light carriage, and carefully adjusted&#xD;
the linen duster over her muslin skirts. She glanced&#xD;
petulantly at the soiled crumples, and hoped he would&#xD;
not perceive them; and then listened to his opening&#xD;
remark, which was admiration of her jessamines.&#xD;
" I am afraid they will be wilted, though," said she,&#xD;
holding 'them up ; " and that would be a sad pity,&#xD;
because I have taken a good deal of trouble to obtain&#xD;
them ; they are going to the Folly this evening."&#xD;
"-So I supposed ; the fame of the fete has travelled&#xD;
far. I heard of it miles away. I take it these sweet&#xD;
things came from a green-house; you must have a&#xD;
friend among the flower-growers."&#xD;
Thus started, communicative little Kitty told him&#xD;
whence they came, and all about her visit to the&#xD;
Quince Bush ; mentioned the expected advent of the&#xD;
coming man, Archie Laurie ; the Red Cottage, and&#xD;
the interesting chores; and before the first mile was&#xD;
passed (he said it was too warm to trot his horse very&#xD;
fast), they were on the chattiest of terms, and the&#xD;
young man had confided to his companion a good&#xD;
deal of valuable information -concerning fly fishing ;&#xD;
and had gone entirely through a moose hunt, from&#xD;
the first springing of the shy game, to the final shot,&#xD;
between the two balls of fire, in the black midnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
PRINCE ALMANAZAR AND. LADY DELIGHT. I&#xD;
Suddenly Kitty burst into a merry laugh.&#xD;
"Might 'F venture to inquire what amuses you?"&#xD;
"Certainly ; I was thinking what Miss Walsingham&#xD;
said about Prince Almanazar,. and how funny it is&#xD;
that I have a ride home, after all."&#xD;
"Very delightful for me, I assure you. I shall&#xD;
also imform you, that I am wondering if you are not&#xD;
the Lady Delight. If these were water-lilies in your&#xD;
hand, I should feel quite sure of it."&#xD;
Kitty opened round eyes at him. "So you know&#xD;
the story; I thought boys never read fairy tales."&#xD;
" I don't know about boys-I read them, from&#xD;
Arabian Nights down to Alice in Wonderland, and&#xD;
the Grimm books. Itow would I do for Prince Al-&#xD;
manazar ? in a tableau, for instance ? "&#xD;
" Only so-so," replied Kitty candidly. "He was a&#xD;
tall, yellow-haired youth, with sparkling eyes. your&#xD;
hair isn't quite yellow, but it might pass, with a lit-&#xD;
tle gold powder. Where do you live, sir?"&#xD;
" I am a citoyen du 7nonde."&#xD;
"Mercy save us ! how learned ! I know some of&#xD;
that myself; I studied French at school. It's my turn&#xD;
now. Calypso se pouvait se consoler pour le depart&#xD;
d' Ulisse. She often walked herself alone,; no, that is&#xD;
the English of it-elle se promenait seul. Now what is&#xD;
next ! well, I could say more, but I won't."&#xD;
He listened attentively, and lhe also wondered if,&#xD;
under her extremely simple exterior, she were quiz..&#xD;
zing him; but the doubt melted when she raised her&#xD;
eyes, brimming with fun, which belied the primly&#xD;

198 PRINCE ALMAiNAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT.&#xD;
tucked corners of her mouth; keeping in the merry&#xD;
laugh which desired to ripple forth, and when he burst&#xD;
out she  leefully joined.&#xD;
" Now if I were only one of these Merry Bank&#xD;
youngsters, I might be of your party, and dance with&#xD;
Miss Belle. Would I get a refusal from the Lady&#xD;
Delight if I should aspire to the honor of a waltz,&#xD;
think you ? "&#xD;
" Meaning me?-"   asked Kitty, dropping her&#xD;
fringed lids with a deep blush, beneath his look of&#xD;
unqualified admiration, and also beneath a thought&#xD;
which flitted through her mind : "What nice eyes&#xD;
he has got for a lover !"&#xD;
"None other, I assure you."&#xD;
"I wish you were going to be there," she answered,&#xD;
frankly, "I should like you for one of my partners&#xD;
very much ; I don't suppose I'll have very many.&#xD;
Archie Laurie is going to dance with me if he comes&#xD;
in time. His aunt said so."&#xD;
" Lucky fellow ! he should have some nice points&#xD;
that you single him out for favors ; and you have never&#xD;
.seen him, you say ?"&#xD;
" No ; but I know a good deal about him. He's&#xD;
got friends where I live; lie is witty, and good, and&#xD;
brave, and handsome."&#xD;
"Handsome ? what is your idea of a handsome&#xD;
man. Where would you class me, for instance?"&#xD;
"Not among the beautiful sheep.  Your hair&#xD;
doesn't curl."&#xD;
"So that is the chiefest element in manly beauty, is.&#xD;
&#xD;
PRINCE ALMANAZAR   ND LADY DELIGHT. 199&#xD;
it? I'll go home and put my locks in curl papers to-&#xD;
night,-if that will do the business for me."&#xD;
"But it won't. I only spoke of that particular be-&#xD;
cause I happened to think of it."&#xD;
"A hopeless case, I see, in your eyes. Well, I am.&#xD;
coming this way to-morrow,'and'I should like to call&#xD;
upon you, and inquire how you enjoyed the party,&#xD;
Could I, do you think?"&#xD;
"As you have been so kind as to fetch me out of&#xD;
the dust, and have talked so nicely, I think you&#xD;
might."&#xD;
", Thank you ; I wish it had been twenty miles, in-&#xD;
stead of-two."&#xD;
"Look at your horse'! he is turning right up to&#xD;
the Red Cottage gate. How did he know where to&#xD;
stop?"&#xD;
"A remarkable case of animal instinct. He saw&#xD;
you looking that way, and discerned immediately his&#xD;
duty and destination."&#xD;
Kitty sprang lightly to the ground, and gayly&#xD;
thanking her escort, she turned away.&#xD;
" Stop one moment, please ; won't you give me.&#xD;
one of your jessamines before you leave me ? I should&#xD;
like a souvenir of this short drive, which I have won-&#xD;
derfully enjoyed."&#xD;
Kitty looked full in his face an instant, and then&#xD;
down at her flowers.&#xD;
"I am so sorry my hair doesn't curl," said he,&#xD;
smiling; "don't let that blemish harden your heart&#xD;
against me."&#xD;

200 PRINCE ALMANAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT&#xD;
She selected a blossom, and offered it to him with-&#xD;
out a word. She began to feel as if she had perhaps:&#xD;
said too much to a.stranger.&#xD;
"Many thanks, Lady Delight," he answered, tak-&#xD;
ing it from her hand, and bowing deeply.&#xD;
"You are quite welcome, Prince Almanazar," said&#xD;
she quickly, running inside the little gate. As she&#xD;
shut it, of course she turned her head for a last look.&#xD;
Curiously enough, he turned at the same moment,&#xD;
for the same purpose, and the child's cheeks were like&#xD;
scarlet when he took off his soft hat, and gave her a.&#xD;
parting salute. She sprang lightly up the stairs with&#xD;
her flowers, only reserving a single blossom, a mate&#xD;
to the one she had given away, which she placed&#xD;
carefully in water, smiling to herself as she did so, and&#xD;
scarcely owning her motive to her secret thoughts.&#xD;
Belle's room was locked.  In answer to Kitty's&#xD;
gay summons she opened it a little and peeped out,&#xD;
but when she made sure who it was, she closed it&#xD;
again hastily.&#xD;
"You cannot come in now, Kitty," she called froii&#xD;
within. ' I am busy."&#xD;
-" I don't wish to come in, you may be sure ; here&#xD;
are ypur jessamines. I really hope you will enjoy&#xD;
wearing'them."&#xD;
Surprised at her lively tone, Belle opened the door'&#xD;
again, and took a look at her. Then she reached out&#xD;
one anointed, begloved hand and pulled them into&#xD;
her, as Noah pulled in the ~ dove, saying curtly,&#xD;
" Thank you."&#xD;
&#xD;
PRINCE ALMANAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT- 201&#xD;
"Have you got the bloody ke' in the Blue Corner,&#xD;
that you are so wonderfully secret?"&#xD;
Belle muttered something about being in a hurry,&#xD;
and shut the door again and locked it.&#xD;
"Coolness is nothing to her," ejaculated Kitty ;&#xD;
"but fortunately, I don't care," and in the highest&#xD;
spirits she danced away up to her woman-friend,&#xD;
where she dashed in like a sportive breeze.&#xD;
" Oh, Carlottal" she exclaimed, dropping into a&#xD;
chair.. "I've had the most elegant, time."&#xD;
"Time, child ! what have you been about ? I&#xD;
didn't hear you anywhere, and I made up my mind&#xD;
that you had retired to the square chamber, and on&#xD;
downy pillows soft reposing were laying an extra stock&#xD;
of beauty for this evening. Cow-bird has been in her&#xD;
stolen nest, after the manner of her kind, all the after-&#xD;
noon. I have heard her chanting triumphant strains&#xD;
from time to time, so I conclude she is satisfied with&#xD;
her conduct and her prospects."&#xD;
"Carlie ! guess what ! I've been up to Miss Wal-&#xD;
singham's !"&#xD;
"What ! where ! how ! when ! " exclaimed Car-&#xD;
lotta, dropping her work and staring.&#xD;
"Those are all adverbs that you are firing off like&#xD;
minute guns; they qualify verbs, adjectives, and other&#xD;
adverbs ; it says so in Green's Grammar."&#xD;
1' You are getting qualified for a straight jacket, I&#xD;
believe."&#xD;
"Not at all; I mean what I say, and I say what I&#xD;
mean ; I have paid a visit to the Quince Bush, and&#xD;

202 PRINCE ALMANAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT,&#xD;
made acquaintance withits mistress, who is to be my&#xD;
auntie forever and ever; amen."&#xD;
" Expound, child," commanded Carlotta shortly.&#xD;
Kitty gave a spirited account of her accomplished&#xD;
mission, her falling asleep so 'oddly under the tree,&#xD;
and wound up with ecstatic praises of her charioteer,&#xD;
and her delightful drive home-&#xD;
"How selfish of Belle ! " was Carlotta's first com-&#xD;
ment, " to poke you offythere in the hot sun just for&#xD;
a whim ;,how could you let her treat you so ? you&#xD;
must learn to resist evil better than this. I shall feel&#xD;
obliged to mention this topic to the cow-bird."&#xD;
" No, don't ! dear Carlie; I have the best of it as&#xD;
it is, because I made a new friend, my papa's friend ;&#xD;
I am to go to her for a visit, I am to have a. choice&#xD;
bouquet for the, evening ; and besides, that person&#xD;
who fetched me home was an exceeding nice person."&#xD;
" Was the fellow handsome, pet ? "&#xD;
"He wasn't a fellow, Carlie; he was a gentleman.&#xD;
He was not handsome, I believe."  She smiled as&#xD;
she added : " His hair did not curl, and he had a long&#xD;
nose ; but his eyes were nice, and he looked strong&#xD;
and :friendly, and he was as 'cute as anything. I&#xD;
laughed ever so at his fun."&#xD;
"!What did he say?)"&#xD;
"Oh, I don't know; I can't tell it so as to make it&#xD;
sound;as he did;. but he looked pleasant and gay,&#xD;
and we had a real merry time; we talked about Prince&#xD;
Almanazar and Lady Delight.".&#xD;
A quick 'blush suffused (Kitty's cheeks. Carlotta&#xD;
&#xD;
PRINCE ALMANAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT 203&#xD;
was inly amused, but she thought proper to put in&#xD;
a slight admonition.&#xD;
" A trifle imprudent, w sn't it, pet, to, talk and jest&#xD;
so freely with a perfect stranger?"&#xD;
"Now, Carlie, don't you say that," answered Kitty,&#xD;
feeling a little alarm lest it must be so, since her&#xD;
woman-friend also'saw it in that light. " I didn't mean&#xD;
to, and I don't believe it was ; I was tired to death&#xD;
and as hot as fire, and 'he had a carriage and asked&#xD;
me to ride, which I am sure was very polite of him,&#xD;
and you wouldn't have me sit mum and glum,&#xD;
because I didn't happen to know who his grandfather&#xD;
was. I can't help it, anyhow. I had a real good&#xD;
time, and I think he enjoyed it too."&#xD;
"Well, pet, I -didn't go to scold. I know quite&#xD;
well my dear Kitty would never do anything wrong, so&#xD;
don't look so troubled ; but come and see tie dress.&#xD;
Isn't it a beauty? Run now, and bring your bertha;&#xD;
you made me forget the hour with your prattle.&#xD;
Come ! fly-before I begin curling your locks," said&#xD;
Carlotta, laying out the hair-pins and brushes.&#xD;
Kitty danced off to her room, humming a gay&#xD;
waltz. She heard the hall door clang together as she&#xD;
crossed the upper passage, and paused a minute to&#xD;
listen to a dialogue between Henry and Winnie.&#xD;
"Look a here, Winnie, what a target-board you've&#xD;
made of my white vest! By the foot of Plutarch'!&#xD;
you might fire a pistol right at me five.paces, and the&#xD;
ball would dodge as if I was an iron-clad."&#xD;
"Yes, sir ; I seen ye were getting a trifle stoop-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7819-00000102"/>&#xD;
204 PRINCE' ALMANAZAR AND 'LADY DELIGHT.&#xD;
shouldered, and I thought you might like bracing up&#xD;
a bit; all for your good, sir."&#xD;
"Tremendously kind ! I've wriggled myunder jaw&#xD;
out of joint, so that it will be lame for a week trying&#xD;
to button the thing."&#xD;
"tOut of joint, is it, sir ? sure it wags all right, sir,&#xD;
and as nimble as a flea in June."&#xD;
Finding he was making no headway; Henry&#xD;
whisked into his room, muttering: " By the foot of&#xD;
Plutarch ! a man has no chance here at all ; these&#xD;
women's tongues are hung in the middle."&#xD;
Kitty laughed ; and thinking how  she would&#xD;
amuse Carlotta with the little fracas, she hurried into&#xD;
the square chamber, pulled out the drawer, and took&#xD;
thence the paper box. No bertha : the pink ribbons&#xD;
were there, the tissue paper was left, though draggled&#xD;
and torn, and nothing mote. In a flutter of eager-&#xD;
ness, and with a sobered face, she looked further ;&#xD;
her bouquet holder and fan were also missing. In&#xD;
disordered haste, she ran into the Blue Corner; and.&#xD;
commenced breathlessly: "Why,~Belle "-she was&#xD;
talking to empty air. The cast-off garments of the&#xD;
blonde were flung upon the chairs ; the almond-paste&#xD;
box, and a pair of torn gloves on the bed ; a few&#xD;
jessamines scattered about the toilette,,diffused their&#xD;
sweetness in forlorn neglect, among brushes, combs,&#xD;
and cosmetiques.;- but the handsome plotter was gone.&#xD;
Winnie at this moment came by with a pair of&#xD;
patent-leather shoes she had been sent to fetch, and&#xD;
.Kitty called out to her:S&#xD;
&#xD;
PRINCE ALMANAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT. 205&#xD;
" Where's Miss -BelleWinnie ?-"&#xD;
" Oh, she be in the thick of the good times afore&#xD;
this, my fairy ; I laced her up half an hour ago, and&#xD;
most beautiful she was, indeed : blue do become Miss&#xD;
Belle like  grand lady to home."&#xD;
"But d she go alone ?"&#xD;
"No, Miss Kitty, darlin', she was fetched in Mr.&#xD;
Nickson's own carriage, her and Miss Ashcroft; I&#xD;
heard them speak something of fixing the flowers up at&#xD;
the Folly. It should be a rare fine party. Ye must let&#xD;
Winnie see her bonnie fairy when ye are 'smarten'd.&#xD;
Ye'll not be as cross as yon kelpie'; she glowered and&#xD;
snapped all the while I was running the feets off me ;&#xD;
she was in that scurry to be off. Indeed, I was near&#xD;
tellin' her I hoped she 'd never make as great haste&#xD;
to be out of the place, as she was anxious to be in;&#xD;
she's over proud, and stomachful, and she looks&#xD;
down on most, but she's seeking a fate that would&#xD;
scare an honest girl."&#xD;
"Winnie, Winnie," called Henry impatiently,&#xD;
"where are my shoes ? "&#xD;
"I'm. a coming' ; God love ye, Mr. Henry, sure ye&#xD;
hain't the patience of a squirrel."&#xD;
The parting remark made by the blonde, when she&#xD;
got her kids and push that day, now flashed across&#xD;
Kitty'; she' had not much heeded it in her soreness&#xD;
of heart, a4d subsequent events had quite driven it&#xD;
from  her memory; she felt bitterly hurt; quite&#xD;
crushed, ad child-like, as there was nothing better&#xD;
to be done, she dropped into: a chair, and began to&#xD;

206 PRINCE ALMANAZAR AND LADY DELIGHT.&#xD;
cry. Carlotta, who was waiting her reappearance,&#xD;
hair-brush in hand, all ready to plunge into the busi-&#xD;
ness of dressing, got impatient with her long stay, ~&#xD;
and after calling twice or thrice, sallied forth to find&#xD;
what had become of her. . tetchy remonstrance&#xD;
died on her lips as she espied the poor little girl, and&#xD;
listened an instant to the heart-breaking sobs which&#xD;
were convulsing her. One- searching glance into the&#xD;
tossed-up drawer, and its disordered contents, showed&#xD;
her the cause.&#xD;
Ah, that pestilent Fringilla that blessed cow-&#xD;
bird !thought she; "I devoutly pray that Henry&#xD;
Gorton will get enough of stylish women this. time.&#xD;
How a sensible man can be so hoodwinked and bam-&#xD;
boozled, and led by the nose, I can't contrive ! Why,&#xD;
she shows her hand just as she does her teeth, every&#xD;
time she opens her mouth ; I wouldn't ask -over five&#xD;
seconds to make her out. Come, pet," she said,&#xD;
taking Kitty in her arms, " I see how it is-but don't&#xD;
you mind. I'm equal to fifty cow-birds ; come and&#xD;
be dressed."&#xD;
Kitty let herself be drawn by the bands of her&#xD;
woman-friend's love. She was always easily com&#xD;
forted and consoled by friendly words ; and she pas-&#xD;
sively followed, but with one pretty 'arm over her&#xD;
eyes, like a grieved child.&#xD;
Now, now ! " said Carlotta briskly, " look,&#xD;
look ! " she brought out of her press a brass-bound&#xD;
box, which she opened with a tiny key:.i sitting down&#xD;
beside Kitty, she took hold of one of her wrists, and&#xD;

pulled the arm around her neck, and laid out on the&#xD;
pillow a fall of old lace, a necklace, brooch, earrings,&#xD;
and bracelets of orient pearls, a rare ivory fan, strung&#xD;
on silken threads, and the prettiest, quaintest cluster&#xD;
of rose-buds, made of feathers so delicate and truly&#xD;
tinted, that the perfume they shed might have been&#xD;
bred -in their hearts. Kitty watched her in silence-;&#xD;
the quivering breath and a deep sob betraying the&#xD;
gust of passion which had swept over her, and -her&#xD;
soft eyes were still heavy with tears ;- she somehow&#xD;
understood, all unlearned in emotional lore. as she&#xD;
was, the half unwillingness with which Carlotta&#xD;
touched the pretty things, and she laid softly a sin-&#xD;
gle finger upon the busy ones working .for her, and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Dear Carlie, this. is the P'rubbish ' that was -sent&#xD;
to you from beyond the sea."&#xD;
"\Well, what if it is ? as ,it can't talk, it will tell no&#xD;
tales; you won't feel the touch of any hand upon&#xD;
it but mine'; and you love me!.' Rare andiprecious,&#xD;
you see ; worth the sending, and worth the wearing ;&#xD;
in truth, they will become you; what is the matter?"&#xD;
Kitty hesitated, and fastened her eyes upon the&#xD;
precious things which she felt were locked out of&#xD;
sight, like' faded hopes, and never meant' to see the&#xD;
light again, and while her color went and came in&#xD;
rosy splashes, she feared to speak her thoughts, and&#xD;
shrank away timidly, "self-folding, like a flower that&#xD;
faints into itself at shut of even."&#xD;
" I must say it, dear Carlie," she broke out at last;&#xD;

"don't be' angry, but I cannot put on these pretties.&#xD;
I never could wear any of the girls' trinkets at school.&#xD;
Please let me god plain. Now, dear woman-friend,,&#xD;
don't look so ; I knew I should vex you ; please&#xD;
don't. I am grateful, but I am only Kitty Clayton.&#xD;
I haven't .got any holes in .my ears, anyhow. I&#xD;
should not know myself in jewels; give me one fresh&#xD;
rose-bud and a couple of geraniums, and don't mind&#xD;
the. bertha,. I like my dress best without ; it looks&#xD;
simple, like me."&#xD;
Carlotta snatched the despised ornaments a .little&#xD;
brashly, and huddled them back into their casket.&#xD;
"Lie there," said she grimly, "till you are wanted,&#xD;
which will be never ; come on, child ; time flies ! "&#xD;
"Now, Carlie, I don't want to go," sobbed Kitty;&#xD;
"you are angry, and I can't have any good time at&#xD;
all. I'll stop at home."&#xD;
Carlotta was ashamed of her injustice instantly, and&#xD;
made haste to repair it. "No, no, pet ; I am notan-&#xD;
gry, only in a hurry ; you shall be dressed just as you&#xD;
please; you are quite right: those gauds don't suit&#xD;
you, a little fresh blossom; they never suited anybody&#xD;
that I know of."&#xD;
But are you sure you have forgiven me?" per-&#xD;
sisted Kitty.&#xD;
"Quite," laughed Carlotta; " look at that tear!&#xD;
why, it is larger than the largest of the unfortunate&#xD;
pearls."&#xD;
"Will you do me a favor, Carlie.?"&#xD;
"A thousand, darling." Even, Kitty was sharp&#xD;

enough to know that the time to get favors from Car-&#xD;
lotta was after she had shown herself unkind, just,&#xD;
or selfish.&#xD;
"Will you wear the pearls and the flowers, and the&#xD;
bertha to-night, over your black satin ? "&#xD;
" Me! put on those things ! "  Carlotta looked at&#xD;
the questioner, and then at her own reflected face in&#xD;
the mirror.. " And why not ?" questioned the black&#xD;
eyes ; "you are passably comely ; you are able to&#xD;
please, if you wish it."&#xD;
"Belle Brandon says you are awful old, Carlotta,"&#xD;
insinuated Kitty with a cunning unworthy her simplic-&#xD;
ity-" too, old for anything."&#xD;
" She does ! well, child, I can tell you, I never saw&#xD;
the family Bible that carries her record, but I know&#xD;
well enough she was walking. before I began to&#xD;
breathe ; but that doesn't matter in the least: what's&#xD;
cow-bird to me, or I to cow-bird ?"&#xD;
"I want to see you dressed fine ; I have often&#xD;
thought of you so,- with many friends around you,&#xD;
and lovers, and you smiling and gracious, and win-&#xD;
some and beautiful; you are beautiful, Carlie. Do&#xD;
just please me ; you said you would."&#xD;
"Yes, but to assume that rubbish, it would look as&#xD;
if my heart was full of something which isn't there.&#xD;
Pitkin Sterling gave me those things."&#xD;
" I know it, Carlie," answered Kitty softly, " and&#xD;
that is why I want to see you in them just once."&#xD;

impulse to prove to Belle that she had powers of&#xD;
pleasing, that she could shine, year outshine, if she&#xD;
chose-a curious wish to try again the attractions&#xD;
which had been so praised by one who, notwithstand-&#xD;
ing them, had wished to remodel her to his own ideas,&#xD;
also, a fancy to gratify her pet, and she answered quite&#xD;
sheepishly for her: "I've as good a right to be a fool&#xD;
as  anybody, and I'll don the motley to please you;&#xD;
so waste no more moments. I will show you what&#xD;
expedition is. I always said I could dress to be mar-&#xD;
ried in fifteen minutes."&#xD;
"Thanks, dear Carlie. Now if we but find lovers&#xD;
up there !"&#xD;
The robing progressed smoothly and swiftly.&#xD;
Nothing could be prettier than the wrinkled cream,&#xD;
even though the only ornaments were fresh rose-buds,&#xD;
shining ivy leaves, and one little jessamine; You&#xD;
wouldn't have noticed 'it: you only knew it was there&#xD;
when you looked. close enough to get a breath of its&#xD;
fragrance. Carlotta surveyed her work with satisfied&#xD;
countenance.&#xD;
" Dear woman-friend," said Kitty, when she had&#xD;
inspected herself, turning about and, about before the&#xD;
mirror, " Belle is welcome to my things ; she has not&#xD;
spoiled my pleasure. Ah!" she added, espying the&#xD;
face over her shoulder and wheeling rapturously,." I&#xD;
knew I was right ; you are wonderful ! superb,!"&#xD;
Carlotta had plaited her tresses, pierced them with&#xD;
the golde  arrow, and shining' above her -forehead&#xD;
were the geat pearls. A new spirit seemed to pos-&#xD;

sess her with this assumption. a, certain ,radiance&#xD;
enveloped her with the satin folds, and she moved&#xD;
swiftly, almost eagerly. T&#xD;
"Come ! let us be gone !1" said she. " I hear the&#xD;
voice of the enchanting chanter;- his tune is lively ;&#xD;
therefore I know he only waits for his women-folk."&#xD;
Gathering her skirts she passed down the old stair-&#xD;
case, and there indeed was our lawyer walking up&#xD;
and down, much braced by his" iron-clad," and sing-&#xD;
ing, "Come over the sea, maiden; visit me."  You^&#xD;
may be sure he felt, reasonable pride in his beautiful&#xD;
charge, as he wrapped her in her fleecy mantle, and&#xD;
led her to the carriage, which had been swearing&#xD;
before our gate for at least half an hour.&#xD;
"What, Belle gone already ? " he asked ; "well,&#xD;
'tis the early applicant that catches the widower." -&#xD;
Just as we were about to drive off, a person on&#xD;
horseback handed in at the window a bouquet, in a&#xD;
holder of old golden filigree work, richly set with&#xD;
rubies. "From Miss Walsingham, for Miss Clay-&#xD;
ton," said he, and galloped swiftly away.&#xD;
"Who was that young man?" demanded Kitty,&#xD;
coloring up.&#xD;
"I am asking myself that very question,"-replied&#xD;
Henry ; "the voice was as 'familiar as 'Dundee' or&#xD;
'Old Hundred;' but I fail to place it."&#xD;
A kind of half suspicion which had glimmered in&#xD;
Kitty's mind died as quickly as it had. lighted,&#xD;
though she-kept quiet all the way to the Foly.&#xD;

E found the grounds of the villa lighted after&#xD;
the most approved manner, with Chinese&#xD;
lanterns hung amongst the lofty branches.&#xD;
A triumphal arch, bearing a festal. inscription, com-&#xD;
manded the gravel entrance ; and the broad veranda&#xD;
Was already filled with gay groups chatting and&#xD;
walking; and rippling laughter and bright, pleasing,&#xD;
youthful voices mingled-the deep tones with the&#xD;
gay trebles, and- the stirring strains of the village&#xD;
band invited to enjoyment. It was evident that the&#xD;
host had left nothing undone which ought to be done&#xD;
in the matter of festive arrangements ; and it was&#xD;
quite as evident that he must have been aided and&#xD;
abetted. bya well-skilled female' mind in carrying out&#xD;
his' designs. Some of the girls caught sight of Kitty&#xD;
under her hood, as the smart servant marshalled us&#xD;

up the wide staircase, flower-lined, and ;came flutter-&#xD;
ing about her with joyful greeting. In the empty&#xD;
dressing-room we slhook out once more the folds of&#xD;
her exquisite dress, and gave a last loving touch to&#xD;
the floating hair, with rapturous pride in the child's&#xD;
beauty. When Henry received her on his arm, and&#xD;
proceeded up the long drawing-room, he looked as&#xD;
proud as a king, and I believe he accepted the mur-&#xD;
mur of admiration she excited, with his chin in the&#xD;
air, as a tribute justly his due ;- feeling himself a pub-&#xD;
lic-spirited person to indulge them in a sight of so&#xD;
much loveliness.&#xD;
The first group they encountered had Belle Bran-&#xD;
don for its centre ; she was radiant -and magihificent&#xD;
in the blue satin, which -I must confess suited her&#xD;
style and presence exactly. With Kitty's point-lace&#xD;
bertha shading her ~ shoulders, Kitty's pearl and&#xD;
parchment fan waving gracefully in her hand, Kitty's&#xD;
silver bouquet holder, filled with choice flowers,,a gift&#xD;
of the enamored host, conspicuous in his primrose-&#xD;
gloved digits; he grasping the elegant trifle with an&#xD;
air of obsequious devotion, as though it had been the&#xD;
best piece of plate, won at the best race. Evidently&#xD;
he was quite far gone;. drunk with the blue eyes'&#xD;
bewitchment.: The long sprays of cape jessamine&#xD;
trailed among her blonde curls, and fell in perfumed&#xD;
profusion over her white shoulders, which with the&#xD;
teeth, dimples, and so forth, were on full exhibition,&#xD;
set out to allure. There was a strange hitter, though,&#xD;
in her 'steely orbs, which might have affrighted a&#xD;

close observer, a certain power of will and cruel des-&#xD;
peration.&#xD;
" Her head was serpent, but ah ! bitter sweet,&#xD;
She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete;&#xD;
And for her eyes, what could such eyes do there&#xD;
But gaze on Nickson, what could he do, but stare ? "&#xD;
The banker was not a close observer of such hint-&#xD;
ings as concerned the inner life ; he had been drink-&#xD;
ing too, his eyes were bloodshot, and his tongue&#xD;
was a little thick already.&#xD;
On the right of the blonde, and listening with&#xD;
polite attention, looking also, as in duty bound, at&#xD;
what was paraded for such looks, stood a young&#xD;
man, with straight hair, a ruddy face, and wearing in&#xD;
his button-hole -a .single blossom of the cape-flower.&#xD;
She was trying ,for him .some of her brilliant talk;&#xD;
and it was curious to observe how easily she managed&#xD;
her smiles, and how warily she preserved the atten-&#xD;
tion of all who approached her, and how coolly she&#xD;
stood the fire of their admiring glances.&#xD;
Kitty felt the hot blood surge over her face, when&#xD;
her eyes met those of the wearer of the jessamine.&#xD;
Instantly Henry seized upon him joyfully and pre-&#xD;
sented him, "My dear friend Archie Laurie "--&#xD;
"Prince Almanazar, if you please!" replied he,&#xD;
bowing low,'and offering his hand, while Henry came&#xD;
near commencing a tune in his astonishment. Kitty&#xD;
ventured another look from beneath her dropped'lids,&#xD;
and catching the infectious, quizzical good-nature,&#xD;

with which his face was brimming, she echoed softly&#xD;
his laugh. Still holding the hand he had taken, he&#xD;
said in a low tone:&#xD;
I ought to beg pardon for not making myself.&#xD;
known to-day, but really it was too good fun; I saw&#xD;
you hadn't the ghost of an id   who I was; and&#xD;
enjoyed your innocent praises too much to cut them&#xD;
short. Don't lay it up against me-I won't do so&#xD;
any more. The Lady Delight gave me a flower ; it&#xD;
matches one I espy upon her bosom; will she also ac-&#xD;
cept me for her knight this evening ? just a rehearsal&#xD;
of the part ; I am all ready to tilt at the Brazen Gates,&#xD;
having her colors in my crest: metaphorically speak-&#xD;

"'No other favor will I weal,&#xD;
Till this sweet token shall decay,&#xD;
And, wilted, hef to be thrown away.'&#xD;
"Take my arm, please, while I make sure of all the&#xD;
waltzes on your programme. You promised me that&#xD;
much, you know, in the chariot. I see a long line of&#xD;
fellows swarming up to ask you."&#xD;
"You labor under a delusion, an illusion, and so&#xD;
on," answered Kitty,-gayly. " I don't remember any&#xD;
such promise; indeed, it is impossible, because I&#xD;
did not know you would be here. I supposed I had&#xD;
seen the last of you. I will keep one for you, though,&#xD;

"Truly, the dancing of the girl is to be commended,&#xD;
for she answereth the music handsomely ; but I hope&#xD;
to -trip it with the fair maid who sleeps under trees."&#xD;
Well, there is one ; the next I am not engaged&#xD;
for, unless Cousin Henry wants me. Oh, there ! he&#xD;
is going to stand, up with Carlotta. How nice ! "&#xD;
"Extremely nice.. There it is: Mr. Archie Lau-&#xD;
rie, No. 3."&#xD;
Mr. Laurie was of the style of young men called&#xD;
chatty, whose subjects are exhaustless.; and the&#xD;
merry talk flowed on as between old friends. He&#xD;
evidently enjoyed.it very much too, because his eyes&#xD;
got bright and his cheeks reddened to as rich a glow&#xD;
as Kitty's- own. Miss Brandon's surprise became&#xD;
something like fury, whf h deepened in intensity, as&#xD;
she surveyed the " chit's" perfect-toilet in its charm-&#xD;
ing detail ; and an . ugly. sneer curled her handsome&#xD;
lip as she said, seeking the first opportunity of speak-&#xD;
ing aside, and she spoke in an unpleasant, under-&#xD;
tone:&#xD;
"I thought you were not coming, Mignonne. I&#xD;
had no idea 'we were playing comedy."&#xD;
" I have finished playing or being played with," said&#xD;
Kitty, very quietly.  " I am in sober earnest now,&#xD;
Belle. I bear no malice. I have been your willing&#xD;
slave, but you can't make me fetch and carry any&#xD;
more ; your charm is broken. You are untrue, un-&#xD;
kind, and selfish; and' I will not call such a woman&#xD;
my friend. You need.not look at me that way. You&#xD;
dare not hurt me. I am not afraid of you. You&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
need not fear that I shall tell what I know of you,&#xD;
You need not think I shall ever mention any money&#xD;
obligations. You are welcome to what you have got,&#xD;
but you will get no more;. although the things' you&#xD;
meanly carried off this evening are costly, although&#xD;
they are my father's gifts, you may keep them. I&#xD;
would not touch them again at any price you could&#xD;
offer me. I should not like to be reminded of trickery,&#xD;
lying, meanness, as I 'would certainly be every time&#xD;
they came in my sight. I am not angry. I don't&#xD;
hate you. I only despise you."&#xD;
Kitty finished as she had begun, very quietly.&#xD;
Her firm, composed attitude, and clear, decided ac-&#xD;
cents gave a, glimpse of. power underlying her soft,&#xD;
baby ways, which might upon occasion develop a&#xD;
self-sustaining "poise of which the owner never&#xD;
dreamed. Belle was thoroughly astonished as well as&#xD;
enraged. Just then Mr. Laurie came, in his character&#xD;
of Prince, to claim the hand of Lady Delight ; and as&#xD;
with a cool, departing nod, she walked away on the&#xD;
arm of the young man Belle had just taken some trou-&#xD;
ble to enchant, I could not.tell what rage and bitter-&#xD;
ness, envy, malice, and all uncharitableness, filled the&#xD;
soul of the handsome woman in the blue satin. One&#xD;
thing is certain : it would be-a pity if an opportunity&#xD;
ever presented itself to act out any of the wicked&#xD;
wishes which crowded her mind and glittered through&#xD;
her blue eyes' steely light;. should such chance ever&#xD;
culminate, poor Kitty would need her wits about her.&#xD;

ingly upon Mr. Nickson, who begged the honor of&#xD;
the first quadrille.&#xD;
"Shall we enter the ring for a cup, Miss-Brandon?&#xD;
I don't know but I may make a few false starts, being&#xD;
a little down in my training ; but I expect we shall&#xD;
come ,in on the home stretch. As. soon as we arm&#xD;
warm in harness-we can step out with a long stride."&#xD;
It was bitter, for after all Belle was born and bred&#xD;
a lady and hated coarseness. Of all her many lovers,,&#xD;
this was the lowest, the meanest. She had. played&#xD;
with noble hearts in her time. She had lost lovers&#xD;
fit for rulers ; and to stoop to this old, battered, dis-&#xD;
sipated, worthless, gambling jockey! Needs must,&#xD;
though, when poverty and. pride spur on ; and the&#xD;
dreadful old-maid future loomed right before her--&#xD;
just at hand. She forced herself to smile graciously,&#xD;
and with pleasing dignity she took her place in the&#xD;
same set with Kitty, who had already forgotten her&#xD;
and her doings. And while the blonde seemed en-&#xD;
grossed with the deep devotion of her elderly aspi-&#xD;
rant, and his horsey, frontier talk, she found oppor-&#xD;
tunity covertly to watch the gay couple opposite, and&#xD;
to feel rage at their lively conversation, and evident&#xD;
pleasure in each other. Meanwhile she was also cal-&#xD;
culating her chances. Had there been a ghost of a&#xD;
probability that Mr: Clayton would come on, she&#xD;
would have waited for him with a new motive--the&#xD;
pleasure of humbling his daughter. But that was a&#xD;
foregone conclusion. It would be a gratification to&#xD;
entrap the youth Archie. She never doubted her&#xD;
&#xD;
CARL OTTA DANCES A QUADRILLE.       2r9&#xD;
power to do so with sufficient opportunity ; and she&#xD;
reflected that a few words called the" Marriage vow"&#xD;
would be no hindrance to such pastime; and she re-&#xD;
solved to finish her fate there and then. Even her&#xD;
blutred and warped consciousness perceived that-she&#xD;
could not remain much longer an inmate of the Red&#xD;
Cottage, especially with Kitty Clayton under the&#xD;
same roof; and while she shot killing glances,. and&#xD;
danced with voluptuous grace; she never forgot for a&#xD;
moment' to feel cruel spite at the child for her recent,&#xD;
plain speaking, her 'sweet beauty, her utter uncon-&#xD;
sciousness of her neigh orhood, her engrossmentin&#xD;
her ruddy-faced partne , and her simple enjoyment&#xD;
of the dancing.&#xD;
Of course, the two elegant girls in their costly array,&#xD;
worn with such easy unconsciousness, crossing- each&#xD;
other in the changes of the quadrille, were the won-&#xD;
der and admiration of all Merry Bank there assem-&#xD;
bled, and I am afraid some of the young ladies in their&#xD;
tarlatans, with which they had been so eminently&#xD;
pleased, became envious at the eclipse they suffered.&#xD;
I know Susan Dusenbury feltthat her time and money&#xD;
were thrown away on the cerulean-blue 'silk, and&#xD;
Jerusha Peacock's green tarlatan was a failure. Poor&#xD;
unconscious Kitty lost popularity, and became the ob-&#xD;
ject of some cutting, remarks, on account of the&#xD;
marked attentions of the bienvenue, who had been&#xD;
the coming man round whom expectations had centred.&#xD;

thought upon the Merry Bankers, whp were to be-&#xD;
come her townspeople and everyday critics, most of&#xD;
whom she regarded as the small dust of the balance&#xD;
at best.&#xD;
Henry, who happened to pass her where she stood&#xD;
after the Lancers, waiting an ice, which her attentive&#xD;
partner had flown on the wings-or love to procure-or&#xD;
to be a little less flowery and more truthful, had gone on&#xD;
legs a trifle unsteady,'owing to frequent imbibement of&#xD;
his own liquors-was attracted by the -fan she was&#xD;
displaying, in one of her carelessly elegant attitudes.&#xD;
Now Henry is a very close observer of women and&#xD;
their apparel, and had greatly admired the choice&#xD;
trifles which Kitty's box had contained. In the hlurry&#xD;
and bustle of court-week, he had missed the plotting&#xD;
and counter-plotting among the inmates of the Red&#xD;
Cottage. Still he remembered his pet Kitty's swollen&#xD;
eyes at the dinner-table, and some random words he&#xD;
had caught from time to time, and which had chimed&#xD;
in curiously enough with the divorce-case he was work-&#xD;
ing up. Now the whole meaning dawned upon him&#xD;
at a glance. After provokingly scanning the recherclde&#xD;
toilette of his stylish guest a moment, with his hands&#xD;
behind his back, he began to hum a doleful lay, but&#xD;
stopped short in it to say:&#xD;
"Belle, you make me think of one of theold fables&#xD;
in my Latin reader, called 'the Jackdaw.' It is ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
221&#xD;
&#xD;
feeding lucky you are not that jackdaw, because in&#xD;
your case all the plucking must be done by a tender&#xD;
little dove, so you are quite safe ; all your borrowed&#xD;
plumes may securely .flaunt. But by the foot of&#xD;
Plutarch! what queerities women are ! I thank God I&#xD;
am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy&#xD;
offences as He hath generally taxed their whole sex&#xD;
withal."&#xD;
A slight tinge of heightened color upon her practised&#xD;
cheek was all the blonde suffered to become visible,&#xD;
as.with a welcoming smile she greeted Mr. Nickson's&#xD;
reappearance,. and gracefully accepting the ice he&#xD;
brought, she turned her back upon her tormentor.&#xD;
"I have not the least idea," she replied.(" her eye-&#xD;
lids opened bland)," " what you are talking about, but&#xD;
I know it must be something interesting, and I want&#xD;
to find the sense, if possible ; as soon as I get through&#xD;
my round of engagements, I'll sit down somewhere&#xD;
in a corner and you  shall explain."&#xD;
She quite fascinated our lawyer's eyes with her&#xD;
strange expression of face. "Her throat was ser-&#xD;
pent, but the words she spoke came as through bub-&#xD;
bling honey.'' He could have sworn he had done her&#xD;
wrong, her voice had such a clear ring, "warn1, tremu-&#xD;
lous, devout, psalterean." Not so Mrs. Ramble, whose&#xD;
low, malicious laugh sounded in Belle's ears a§ she fin-&#xD;
ished her speech. Wheeling quickly about, she con-&#xD;
fronted that snuffy lady, who was edging here and&#xD;
there amongst the crowd, arrayed in her best bomba--&#xD;
zine, having her folded handkerchief across her arm,&#xD;

and the spectacles, with which'she had been examin-&#xD;
ing all the dresses, in her fingers. Had Miss Brandon&#xD;
been wise, she  would have restrained the contempt-&#xD;
which curled her haughty lip, and allowed her enemy&#xD;
to go unaccosted on her way ; but Henry's speech,&#xD;
and the. consciousness that this old woman had heard,&#xD;
and enjoyed it, piled over all her other, causes of an-&#xD;
noyance, exasperated her so, much that she was glad&#xD;
of a victim.&#xD;
"How comes this pre-Adamite here ? " she ex-&#xD;
claimed, drawing away from the neighborhood of the&#xD;
bombazine ; " of course she is not an invited guest;'&#xD;
and it is too- soon for the gathering of the cold&#xD;
pieces!"&#xD;
Mr. Nickson did not hear the remark, being called&#xD;
off to attend to the forming of the -sets ; but Mrs.&#xD;
Ramble heard it well, and she stopped, eager for an-&#xD;
encounter with her foe in this fair field; and she&#xD;
launched a preparatory affront out of her watery,&#xD;
deep-set eyes.&#xD;
"Why, Belle Brandon!" she began in a high-keyed&#xD;
voice, pinching the blue skirt, and holding it fast;&#xD;
"why, massy me ! how beautiful you do look in&#xD;
Kitty's satin frock ! Did you buy it, or borrow it,&#xD;
or steal it, hey? How you have got your hair rigged&#xD;
up! She's .a kind-hearted little creature, isn't she ?&#xD;
My land ! if that ain't her fan you're flirting round so&#xD;
genteel; and her bokay bottle, or whatever you call&#xD;
that thing-a-ma-jig. Why, you've got on all Kitty's&#xD;
things that come in the box the other day from New&#xD;

Orleans. You. do beat the Dutch; and you know&#xD;
who the Dutch beat, don't you ? Kitty's here, ain't&#xD;
she? Oh, yes; .I see her over there, jest as putty as&#xD;
a sweet pea. I heard tell about her lending you&#xD;
that fifty dollars up to Lamode's. Is this the han-&#xD;
kercher ? du 'let's look at it; I never seen a 'nose-&#xD;
wiper that cost fifty dollars ; I'm glad to get enough&#xD;
on 'em for fifty cents. '.She seized the filmy bit of&#xD;
lace, and spread .it in her fingers. "Well, you do&#xD;
take the tuck out of the whole ! Kitty's ring onto&#xD;
it ! I must run round and see what the child has&#xD;
left.  I should have thought she'd a-been clean&#xD;
stripped."&#xD;
Then advancing her wrinkled face close to the&#xD;
creamy ear of the handsome blonde, who stood upon&#xD;
the rack hemmed in by many listeners, she added,in&#xD;
a stage whisper, "You remember, I degsay, what I&#xD;
told you and you told me that day up in the blue-&#xD;
-room ! I thought -as like as not I'd make you re-&#xD;
member it. I rather expect I'm even with you now."&#xD;
A giggle from Susan Dusenbury, and the two Miss&#xD;
Standbys, the elderly twins who had never been sep-&#xD;
arated a day in their lives-who had also been victims&#xD;
of Belle's sarcasms on previous occasions-showed&#xD;
how keenly they relished her position. It was really&#xD;
wonderful what a facility the had for making enemies&#xD;
among her own sex.&#xD;
During a. pause in the dancing, Kitty, who had&#xD;
had plenty of partners and waltzed herself weary,&#xD;
discovered Miss" Walsingham upon, a sofa.  That&#xD;

stately lady drew back her velvet dress, and smilingly&#xD;
beckoned for the little girl to come and sit beside&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"A few minutes among the wall-flowers will be&#xD;
good for you, my love, after so much admiration."&#xD;
The - affectionate glance accompanying her words&#xD;
showed how thoroughly she enjoyed Kitty's triumph.&#xD;
"Pray, how do you find Prince Almanazar ?  I hope&#xD;
he is up to the part. Let me see--good, sensible,&#xD;
brave, and kind.'"&#xD;
Kitty blushed scarlet.  "I think I have been&#xD;
through the whole chapter of blunders to-day-.&#xD;
a perfect blunderbuss ; but you must not laugh&#xD;
at me ; you promised to be my friend-and friends&#xD;
are always sympathetic and charitable. I-paid well&#xD;
for my silly gabble to-night, in the shame- and con-&#xD;
fusion I felt when-I was presented to Mr. Laurie."&#xD;
Aunt Elinor laughed, as she tap ed the round&#xD;
cheek turned toward her, with her black fan. "Had&#xD;
you a pleasant ride home ?" asked she.&#xD;
"Oh, delightful ! I suppose you heard all-how I&#xD;
went to sleep like a little goose ; and I expect I&#xD;
should have slept till this time, if he had not&#xD;
wakened me up. Really, now, don't laugh, auntie,&#xD;
but it was a little like the Prince and the water-lily;-&#xD;
wasn't it? ".&#xD;
"Well, not so very much ; you are vastly more&#xD;
like a fresh rose-bud, or a-sweet violet, than a color-&#xD;
less water-lily; and" as for the boy Archie, you&#xD;
mustn't go to work'and glorify him, woman-fashion ;&#xD;

t&#xD;
&#xD;
because he is only a jolly, good-tempered youngster,&#xD;
o nearer perfection than you are."&#xD;
Kitty sent a swift, shy look at the gentleman who&#xD;
was standing up with Bianca Ashcroft, and another&#xD;
into the eyes of the stout lady who advised her.&#xD;
All alike ! " thought Aunt Elinor ; " well,&#xD;
'There's nothing half /so sweet in life as Love's&#xD;
young dream;' so let her enjoy it. Pity it fades so&#xD;
soon ! "&#xD;
"I was glad Mr. Laurie happened along just as he&#xD;
did, for I was horribly tired, and never in the world&#xD;
could have reached home in time to dress."&#xD;
"Happened ! you precious little simpleton ! I&#xD;
sent the youth. after you, as soon as Flora could be&#xD;
put into harness, which took time, as she was in the&#xD;
pasture, and objected to being caught.  It would&#xD;
have been much more sensible and old-dameish to&#xD;
have kept you, but I have whims as well as other&#xD;
people; and as you had put Prince Almanazar into&#xD;
my head, I thought I would send the flying horse in&#xD;
pursuit ; and fortunately, your charming little fashion&#xD;
of folding your hands, shutting your eyes, opening&#xD;
your mouth, and dozing off at the foot of a green&#xD;
tree, like, a maid in a pastoral, made it all come right.:&#xD;
I assure you, Archie went-into many raptures over&#xD;
your picturesque pose, and bitterly regretted the lack&#xD;
of genius which hindered his conveying to canvas the&#xD;
'one warm- flushed moment,' which he declares he&#xD;
can never-never forget!"&#xD;
" ButI don't believe I slept with my mouth open.;&#xD;

&#xD;
I am sure I never do ; such a figure ! " replied Kitty,&#xD;
not at all pleased with the picture.,&#xD;
" So sayeth the witness. Do you see that horrible&#xD;
old woman over there ? well, she has been sitting by&#xD;
me, giving me a full and particular account of Miss&#xD;
Brandon's outfit. Though ,I happen to know some-&#xD;
thing of her ancient achievements in her peculiar&#xD;
line, I must say she has out-Brandored Brandon this&#xD;
time. Now .I must also scold you, silly child ; are&#xD;
you going to let every designing person prey upon&#xD;
you ? Don't you know the world i full of Harpies&#xD;
and Gorgons ? You must learn' to . do battle for&#xD;
yourself-stand!  'The - ground's your own, my&#xD;
brave!"&#xD;
"But I don't feel comfortable so, auntie ; I like&#xD;
peace and pleasantness. After all, what does it mat-&#xD;
ter for a few paltry wearables, if they must- be kept&#xD;
at the price of prickles and stings and claws ? They&#xD;
are not essential to salvation ; I an just as well off,&#xD;
without those things, and with them Belle is achiev-&#xD;
ing a triumph."&#xD;
" Kitty, Kitty ! there are two sides to you'; you&#xD;
are both hilly and wise. I was about to say you'&#xD;
must get a lover to take care of you ; but I believe,&#xD;
on the contrary, that you would be able to take care&#xD;
of a lover, if need be."&#xD;
"Thank you, dear auntie," replied Kitty, quite&#xD;
soberly. "I mean to be wise like the- serpent, and&#xD;
harmless like the dove."&#xD;
She laid a soft hand upon the hearty one of her&#xD;
&#xD;
new friend, who felt the quiet power under the baby&#xD;
ways-as I had done often-and she took the fingers&#xD;
within her own with:a kind pressure.&#xD;
"You. have got the right end of it, darling-the&#xD;
true secret of happiness. Poor Belle!&#xD;
" Yes ; I wish Mrs. Ramble would not go talking&#xD;
about what does not in the least concern her. I 'am&#xD;
very happy. It is good to have friends-see my&#xD;
pretty flowers !&#xD;
"I am glad you like the bauble, darling. - You.&#xD;
have a precious right to it ; for Paul Clayton gave it&#xD;
to me when I was a young lassie like you ; now I&#xD;
return it to you,, and you can't help thinking of a&#xD;
stout old woman every time you carry it; that pleases&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"You loved rmy papatwhen he was young," said&#xD;
straightforward Kitty, with an intuitive perception of&#xD;
the case. "Why then did you not marry 1him?"&#xD;
"I had a sort of liking for the lad," replied Aunt&#xD;
Elinor. "He never knew it. I thought one while&#xD;
that he liked me, but as it turned out, he didn't."&#xD;
"How I wish he would come now, and make you&#xD;
my mamma !"&#xD;
"Nonsense, child ! I haven't seen him for, twenty&#xD;
years. I'm -old and stout, and I dare say ,I shouldn't&#xD;
know him if ILmet him," replied Aunt Elinor with a&#xD;
little flutter she was heartily ashamed of. " Look f&#xD;

whispers, the covert laughter. which are levelled at&#xD;
that handsome plotter. Don't you think she is get-&#xD;
ting her pay ? verily, the way of the transgressor is&#xD;
hard. Every female in the room knows that each&#xD;
article of her beautiful costume is borrowed or begged&#xD;
-and of course every married male will know all&#xD;
about it before- to-morrow morning. Purgatory is&#xD;
nothing to her state of mind at this moment. But it&#xD;
won't cure her !"&#xD;
"Too bad, auntie : what do people want to be so&#xD;
ill-natured for? There isn't surely any person so un-&#xD;
kind as to carry Mrs. Ramble's talk to her ears."&#xD;
"It doesn't need words, my dear ; look at her&#xD;
face-did you ever see rage and mortification better&#xD;
veiled? admire that gushing smile into Mr. Nickson's&#xD;
eyes, after a baleful dart, shot from her blue orbs, at&#xD;
the snuffy old-woman. If an eyebeam were a dag-&#xD;
ger, how fatal would that one prove ! verily she had&#xD;
gossiped her, last this night. Upon my word, that&#xD;
girl is a wonderful creature ! . If she only had a&#xD;
heart, what a woman she would be!"&#xD;
Yes, indeed, auntie; she can be very charming ;&#xD;
and she is the"'handsomest girl here, isn't she? what&#xD;
beautiful hair she has ! "&#xD;
" Hair! yes, but those crisped, snaky, golden locks,&#xD;
which make such wanton. gambols with the wind,&#xD;
upon supposed fairness, are often known ,to be the&#xD;
dowry of a second head; the skull that bred them&#xD;
lying barely in- the sepulchre," replied Aunt Elinor,&#xD;
grimly.&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now you wrong Belle, auntie ; those floating&#xD;
curls are all her own."&#xD;
"Yes, it appears so ; that is, she bought, and I&#xD;
hope she paid for them."&#xD;
" No, no ; but they grew there," persisted Kitty,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
"I wouldn't swear to that, my dear ; unless you&#xD;
have tried them hair by hair. Belle Brandon's ways&#xD;
are too wonderful for you, simple Kitty."&#xD;
Their talk was interrupted by Jerusha Peacock, to&#xD;
whom the party was an utter failure. - "I hate such&#xD;
fandangos," said she wearily. "The starch is all out&#xD;
of my tarlatan; I've spent half the evening looking&#xD;
at that brush-heap" (pointing to a moss-basket)&#xD;
" and counting the braids in Jane Potter's chignon;&#xD;
she sat down right in front of me. And -then Harold&#xD;
Ashcroft brought up that lean owl; they always bring&#xD;
up all the forlorn young men to me ; and when I&#xD;
asked him for a biscuit, he fetched it on a fork, and&#xD;
then he came with chicken-salad and a teaspoon,&#xD;
and after everybody was gone out of the room, he&#xD;
came back and found me looking at some gold-&#xD;
fish, and he said, 'He ! he ! there you are : the last&#xD;
one-what are you going to do now?' And I&#xD;
marched off saying,.' I shall join my friends immedi-&#xD;
ately.' I think. parties are a bore."&#xD;
Just at this instant Tom Larkins convoyed an as-&#xD;
pirant for an introduction to Miss Clayton, and leav-&#xD;

was quite equal to the occasion, Kitty took her place&#xD;

in a quadrille just as Carlotta advanced upon the arm&#xD;
of young Laurie, whom she had been used to pet as&#xD;
a boy, and for whom she retained her full liking.&#xD;
Her face was all unlocked, cheery, and winning ;&#xD;
her holiday good-hum'or suited her attire. I had been&#xD;
admiring her-all the evening, and Henry and I had&#xD;
proudly compared- notes on the completeness of our&#xD;
garden of spices.  Kitty and her partner took the&#xD;
head, Carlotta stood on the right, and the opposite&#xD;
place was empty till just before the quadrille com-&#xD;
menced. Then a gentleman talking with Bianca&#xD;
Ashcroft came and took the vacant " fourth."  Kitty&#xD;
happened to 'be looking at her woman-friend in her&#xD;
pearls and satin, and she started at sight of the quick&#xD;
change which passed upon her features. Her eyes&#xD;
were fixed upon her vis-d-vis, and her face was white&#xD;
as death, and Kitty could almost hear her heart-throbs,&#xD;
and she knew instantly that Pitkin' Sterling had come&#xD;
home. She forgot to be polite to her partner in&#xD;
watching the couple so long separated and so unex-&#xD;
pectedly brought close together again.  It seemed&#xD;
like a tale out of a story book. Only bows and quiet&#xD;
salutations were exchanged through the dance, and&#xD;
at its close Kitty ran breathless back to Miss Wal-&#xD;
singham with the news.&#xD;
"Carlotta's lover has come! look, they are speak-&#xD;

Meanwhile Carlotta stood- composedly still under&#xD;

desired to mould her to his model. She had gotten&#xD;
back all her senses, and was ready to hear whatever&#xD;
he would say.&#xD;
"I have your last letter in my pocket, Carlotta,&#xD;
which I will discuss with you if you give me leave to&#xD;
come and see you."&#xD;
" Certainly I will give you leave. I, for one, have not&#xD;
forgotten our compact to talk together on your return,&#xD;
no matter what we might find expedient to say. I&#xD;
demand as my right the fulfilment of that pledge."&#xD;
Mr. Sterling smiled. "I could believe that I'took&#xD;
leave of you last evening out by the Scotch rose&#xD;
hedge; you have not changed in the least, either in&#xD;
voice or manner."~&#xD;
" I don't intend to change, sir. I am quite .satis-&#xD;

"Oh ! I am entirely aware of that ; you expended.&#xD;

S "I hope I made it clear, sir ; such was my en-&#xD;

"Don't be sharp., Carlotta! look a little bit sweet&#xD;

"Nonsense. No. I haven't so much as looked at&#xD;
this trumpery for an age, sir. It is a mere happen-so&#xD;
that I have it on to-night. I unearthed the ,rubbish&#xD;
to please a child, whose whims cropped out in this&#xD;
direction unexpectedly."&#xD;
Trumpery! rubbish ! Carlotta, and yet an em-&#xD;
press wears poorer jewels.. How, then, about the&#xD;
golden arrow ? was that hidden up also ? "&#xD;
" No, sir ; I have put it on once each year, on the&#xD;
return of the day on which you asked me to be your&#xD;
wife. I have worn it, and have enjoyed thinking of&#xD;
you as you ought to have been, and of myself as I&#xD;
might have been if you had been less pragmatical and&#xD;
more satisfactory.".&#xD;
"Don't provoke me, Carlotta! I have come with a&#xD;
heart full of tenderness, willing to take you at your&#xD;
own valuation."&#xD;
"You think so ; on the contrary, I see that you be-&#xD;
lieve yourself all in all, and I am only a woman.&#xD;
'I could.endure chains nowhere patiently, and chains&#xD;
at home, where I am free by birthright, not at all;'&#xD;
therefore it is my belief that you will take your heart&#xD;
away again.&#xD;
"aYes, I want to be all in all; .I mean to be, Iam&#xD;
resolved to be ; come, dance with me, and don't&#xD;
quarrel any more this evening; we'll have a grand&#xD;
pow-wow to-morrow morning, and read over your&#xD;
horrible letter together; or I will recite to- you; I&#xD;

hands with an old friend yet'; you can afford me that&#xD;
much, I am sure ; I won't presume on your affable-&#xD;
ness to cut short any arguments."&#xD;
Carlotta laughed, and put her hand into the one'&#xD;
he offered. I don't believe she would, though, if she&#xD;
had counted on such a hearty squeeze as she got;&#xD;
but she did get it; and it was over, and she made no&#xD;
comments. Everybody who loved her knew that&#xD;
she was happy.; she could not help the radiance and&#xD;
glory of her love from shining through her, any more&#xD;
than' a cactus bloom could fold its petals. over its&#xD;
heart in the glowing sunlight. I must say I was re-&#xD;
joiced; I wanted her to get married to this good&#xD;
fellow ; and Henry and I walked away arm in arm&#xD;
to talk secretly over the opening future we both&#xD;
desired.&#xD;

MAKING LOVE IN THE BALL-ROOM    235&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
MAKING LOVE IN THE BALL-ROOM.&#xD;
ELLE    BRANDON .carried herself loftily&#xD;
through' all the disagreeables of the night-&#xD;
among all the titters and sneers and scornful&#xD;
looks; they came from the women, and. she never&#xD;
greatly regarded the opinions of her; own sex. Meet-&#xD;
ing-Kitty now and then chatting with Archie Laurie,&#xD;
she did wish for "a little time to carry him offfrom&#xD;
her ; but she could not in the present #ositi'on of&#xD;
affairs afford to wait. Mrs. Ramble's ridiculous tales&#xD;
might reach masculine ears, and redound to her pre-&#xD;
judice, even with the banker. "I ought to have, a&#xD;
tall, good-looking husband ; I always meant to have&#xD;
one with black hair to set off my fairness, hanging on&#xD;
hisarm. Ah ! poor Henriques; he was a handsome&#xD;
bruno," she thought, as she watched the merry pair.&#xD;
"Eh ! that horrible cat! -I could choke her. with&#xD;
&#xD;
pleasure!"  She closed her soft, dimpled fingers&#xD;
viciously over her flowers, as an 'aggravating cackle&#xD;
reached her from Mrs. Ramble. "Bah! how my feet&#xD;
ache ! how stupid it all is ! how weary I am of it! -I&#xD;
wish I was a gray mouse in a wainscot."&#xD;
Just then Mr. Nickson appeared with Jerusha&#xD;
Peacock on his arm, whose face was quite shortened&#xD;
and chirk, and who giggled vivaciously in apprecia-&#xD;
tion of some titbit 'of wi uttered by the host, and&#xD;
Belle turned her thought steadily toward him. He&#xD;
must answer, he was so rich ! He could give her a&#xD;
table to sit at, and she resolved to occupy the head,&#xD;
even though she must look at him opposite her every&#xD;
day for the rest of her life. She deliberately made&#xD;
up her mind to ignore the ugly tales of his former ex-&#xD;
ploits, which were, thanks to Mrs. Ramble's industry,&#xD;
beginning to be rife in Merry Bank-his jockeying,&#xD;
gambling, his coarse falseness to' women; his dead&#xD;
wife, her old friend, beaten, distracted, heart-broken;&#xD;
the whole terrible scene had been portrayed to her-,&#xD;
the cruel blows, the dreary wandering through the&#xD;
dark night-the dismal hiding in the old school-house&#xD;
--the terrible finding of the two bodies, the mother&#xD;
and child-the mad uproar of the town-the secret&#xD;
flight of the wicked man. -'She put them all behind&#xD;
her, but they were strange thoughts which flitted&#xD;
through her brain-strange for a woman who looks&#xD;
in her lover's face, and it was a hard, col glitter&#xD;
which gleamed in her blue eyes. A vision of possi-&#xD;
ble -scenes in her wedded life arose before her, and&#xD;

&#xD;
she set her sharp, white teeth, and pushed on her&#xD;
Way.   It needed but one alluring eyebeam, one&#xD;
melting, gushing look, and he was at her side. Her&#xD;
splendid, luscious beauty kindled his sensual nature,&#xD;
and his eyes, which had a mean fashion of turning&#xD;
aside while honest people regarded them, gloated&#xD;
upon her charms ; she endured his bold gaze without&#xD;
the falling of an eyelid ; nay, she courted it. In the&#xD;
deep bay-window with the cool night-wind blowing&#xD;
back her curls, scattering sweetness from her-wreath&#xD;
of jessamines ; the noise of the music, and the meas-&#xD;
ured tread of .the dancers, and the hum of young&#xD;
voices vibrating on the air; shut in to privacy by the&#xD;
trailing curtains, innocence and youth outside-he&#xD;
offered.to her his battered old heart, all shrunk and&#xD;
withered long ago ; his shaking hand, foul with many&#xD;
a cheating act; -his deadened, degraded manhood,&#xD;
reeking with debauch, dragged through vile scenes&#xD;
and dirty ways ; and she, knowing it all, suffered him&#xD;
to draw toward him her stately head, beautiful as&#xD;
Juno, With its perfumed crown, and to lay it against&#xD;
his spotless waistcoat, and did not shudder nor shrink&#xD;
from his rapturous embrace, though her sweet&#xD;
maiden-breath mingled with his, all rank with the reek&#xD;
ofdrunkenness.*ithe young, handsome, proudwoman,&#xD;
with intellect enough to make a .name, industry&#xD;
enough to keep it ; with health, vigor, and versatile&#xD;
accomplishments, was aboutto surrender them all to&#xD;
a master, was about to barter them all for money!&#xD;
And her white bosom swelled with triumph when she&#xD;
&#xD;
glanced at the glittering circlet spanning her finger,&#xD;
the pledge and .token of success. It was a costly&#xD;
thing, rare and choice, worthy of the hand it adorned.&#xD;
To say trdly, the happy man had been carrying it&#xD;
about in this vest, waiting for this culminating&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
At last he would be rich, independent, splendid !&#xD;
No. more miserable managing and plotting, no more&#xD;
sneaking, despicable necessities. She sent back a&#xD;
thought to some former scenes of her life, when she&#xD;
had said the same words to herself with infinitely.&#xD;
brighter prospects, and had lived long enough to&#xD;
prove them but idle breath. This last chance must&#xD;
be the victorious winning. True, she did just once&#xD;
glance at the lanky hair, the bloodshot, cunning&#xD;
eyes, the purple, hairy, shaking old hand grasping&#xD;
hers, so white and dimpled ; all so drearily different&#xD;
from the husband she would like, from any of the&#xD;
many she had thought to have. "George Blair!"&#xD;
Ah! there came a bitter pang; her soul died within&#xD;
her, but only for one brief moment. Gathering her-&#xD;
self together soul and body, with a haughty gesture&#xD;
she pushed resolutely away all such thoughts, and&#xD;
walked proudly down the rooms, and stood among&#xD;
the guests, with the husband she would take, " to&#xD;
love, honor, obey, till death them should part."&#xD;
Poor Belle ! after all, she had scarcely a fair chance ;&#xD;
no loving, judicious mother to guide and govern her&#xD;
wayward spirit, to point an aim for her ambition, to&#xD;
root out her selfishness, and curb her towering pride,&#xD;

to lead her affections -softly among domestic virtues.&#xD;
Marriage, the only object of pursuit and attainment;&#xD;
thrust before her from babyhood up. Money, gran-&#xD;
-deur, style, fashion, the highest types of life-the&#xD;
coveted possessions. Little account of genuine man-&#xD;
hood was made in the practical instructions she re-&#xD;
ceived.  Small vices were winked at ; great ones&#xD;
ignored ; and no reckoning whatever upon truth,&#xD;
honesty, rectitude ; so the exterior was polished, at-&#xD;
tractive; and golden..' Belle Brandon might have been&#xD;
as good as the average, hedged in by proper influen-&#xD;
ces. Circumstances make as many good people as&#xD;
inborn virtues. Absence of temptation keeps as many&#xD;
correct lives as native love of purity. .Belle Brandon&#xD;
had no such thoughts as these in her mind at this&#xD;
epoch in her affairs. Her prime object attained, she&#xD;
lent her energies to the next stepin her pathway,&#xD;
viz.: the securing a refuge and safe retreat till the&#xD;
day other wedding. She was resolved not to go to&#xD;
New York ; not to show herself there till after the&#xD;
ceremony. She hid no desire to flaunt Mr. Nickson&#xD;
as a betrothed ; as a husband-appendage it would' be&#xD;
different. Her uncle was in Europe, and she knew&#xD;
quite well nothing could be effected with Aunt Isa-&#xD;
doi-e, and she meant to remain at the Red Cottage&#xD;
till she became a br-ide. It was a delicate thing to&#xD;
manage ; but she rose equal to the occasion. By ob-&#xD;
taining a private conference with our lawyer ; by&#xD;
tears, penitence, grief, and loveliness, she won upon&#xD;
his sympathy, inspired his pity, and gained her point.&#xD;
&#xD;
Three weeks after the f6te at the Folly, Mr. Nickson&#xD;
took her from among us a wife, making short woo-&#xD;
ing that he might exhibit his prize at Saratoga, New-&#xD;
port, and other marts, before the season should be&#xD;
finished, and the great American show closed for the&#xD;
year.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
PAUL AND VIRGINIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE wonderful party over, and Belle Brandon&#xD;
Nickson gone, the rest of the summer flew&#xD;
evenly and pleasantly away. Mr. Archie&#xD;
Laurie availed himself of Kitty's permission, and not&#xD;
only called the next morning after that festive occa-&#xD;
sion, but several other mornings; and Aunt Elinor&#xD;
also kept her promise, coming in her handsome&#xD;
carriage, and taking Kitty away to the Quince-Bush,&#xD;
nothing loath, for a long visit. The old love for Paul&#xD;
Clayton found -a new spring of tenderness in his pretty&#xD;
daughter, and the stout lady manifested the great-&#xD;
est possible interest in her sayings and doings, and&#xD;
listened to her childish prattle and sensible talk (our&#xD;
Kitty could be soberly sensible upon occasion, in a&#xD;
grave, quiet, old-fashioned way) ; and she told her&#xD;
many tales of her youth, her trials and.victories; her&#xD;
&#xD;
journeying in foreign lands, and the strange peoples&#xD;
she had seen, in rich, racy language, as strong and&#xD;
vigorous as her full-flowing voice, and her personable,&#xD;
independent self. Best of all, Kitty loved the boy-&#xD;
and-girl frolics, where " Paul" was the hero ;- the&#xD;
Roaring River life, among the breezy hills ; and&#xD;
through the raconteur she made acquaintance with&#xD;
many of our old favorites, who would, have been her&#xD;
friends, butfor the peculiar accidents of her life which&#xD;
isolated her from the people and places known and&#xD;
loved-by the last of the Claytons.&#xD;
Aunt Elinor -read and studied with the child-&#xD;
guided her taste by her own rare cultivation. Ear-&#xD;
nest and indefatigable, as in her flower-growing and&#xD;
stock-raising, she made the visit a rich harvest for&#xD;
Kitty, who, though never an enthusiastic scholar or&#xD;
great bookworm, still took in much good knowledge,,.&#xD;
and lived long enough to thank the tireless teacher for a&#xD;
beginning, of which she reaped the fruits in her whqle&#xD;
after life. We were. the more willing to have her&#xD;
leave us because we had our hands full of Belle Bran-&#xD;
don, and we did not wish our sweet flower to come in&#xD;
further contact with that arch plotter.&#xD;
Carlotta was full of her own life; and it was&#xD;
strange how a rekindling of her smouldering love&#xD;
softened her towards the woman for whom her sweet-&#xD;
est word had been "cow-birdr" or "pestilent&#xD;
Fri  la.' Carlotta was beautiful in her happiness.&#xD;

a mantle of charity poor Bell 's faults and sins.. And&#xD;
Henry came off vastly better than he expected in'his&#xD;
confession of the extorted permissionhe had accorded&#xD;
for her prolonged sojourn, and its avowed consumma-&#xD;
tion. And though she did not duplicate the kiss of&#xD;
peace and forgiveness gentle Kitty Clayton left upon&#xD;
the handsome bride's lips at parting, she pleasantly,&#xD;
assisted' in the preparations-fancy cooking, jellies,&#xD;
black cake, 'and so on-and bade her "good-by, and&#xD;
every happiness ; " and what is quite as worthy of&#xD;
mention, she refrained from all cutting speeches and&#xD;
provoking taunts, when our 'lawyer discovered that he&#xD;
Ihad-fallen heir to a long list of dress-makers' and other&#xD;
bills, bequeathed to him by the departed blonde.&#xD;
As for Archie and Miss Kitty, they were as happy&#xD;
as children '-together. 'They made no secret of their&#xD;
fondness fQr each other; the young fellow's manly&#xD;
proportions had not outgrown his boyish jollity, and&#xD;
the two fished in the creek, rode the ponies, ran&#xD;
races, and frolicked, like the light-hearted youths&#xD;
they were, He even taught the lassie to play the&#xD;
classic game of "mumbleAhe-peg," and-insisted that&#xD;
she should draw out the stick driven into 'the ground&#xD;
with four right strokes of the knife-blade, according&#xD;
to time-immemorial usage:; which feat she accom&#xD;
polished to the' peril of her little white teeth, amidst&#xD;
much merry jesting, Aunt Elinor presiding as umpire&#xD;
to see fair play.,&#xD;
Kitty learned to row on the pond, and originated&#xD;
with Miss Walsingham's help-who entered warmly&#xD;
&#xD;
1"r}-f   ' _&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
into the affair, and did all the stitching on her'&#xD;
" Singer," as if she wzre governing a rebel-a costume&#xD;
for their fishing and woodland.excursions. A broad-&#xD;
brimmed Leghorn hat d la Wateau, ornamented with&#xD;
pale-blue and delicate rose-tints, which blend so del-&#xD;
icately in that old painter's pictures ; and a dress of&#xD;
graystuff slashed and trimmed with bands of violet ;&#xD;
dainty little high-heeled, thick-soled boots; gauntlets&#xD;
of buck-skin with tassels ; and thus jauntily arrayed,&#xD;
you wouldn't believe how -lovely she was., She quite&#xD;
upset poor Archie, who wasn't good for anything for&#xD;
gazing at her. They were out in the boat one .day,&#xD;
she pulling the oars, and he enjoying otium cum&#xD;
dignitate-puffing his cigar and looking at the-rower.&#xD;
"Kitty," said he, between the whiffs, "'let's go&#xD;
and get our pictures taken together."&#xD;
"Together," she replied, doubtfully;  I don't&#xD;
know as that would be proper."&#xD;
"Why not? brothers and sisters often sit that&#xD;
way."&#xD;
"Oh, yes; if I hada 'brother I could; but as I&#xD;
haven't any, I'don't care about it."&#xD;
Archie watched her little pout, looking askance at&#xD;
the water, and admired afresh the rosycolor in' her&#xD;
cheeks, and her curls floating about.&#xD;
" You won't be my little sister, then?. I haven't&#xD;
any, you know."&#xD;
"-No, I will not; brothers take too.great liberties&#xD;

"I wouldn't find fault, Kitty ; I have io talent of&#xD;
discovery, and it would need a painstaking person-&#xD;
to pick flaws out of perfection. Come, say 'yes' to&#xD;
the picture ; it would please Aunt Elinor so much."&#xD;
"'Why, if auntie wishes it, perhaps I might ; 1pt&#xD;
in those double things one is sure to be ugly. I doh't&#xD;
want to be the one, and you can't afford it."&#xD;
"Thank you-; I shall try to look my best.",&#xD;
"How I wish your hair would curl-it is so&#xD;
straight' "&#xD;
"I'll have it shaved, and then you won't notice the&#xD;
terrible fault. Luckily, yours curls enough for two-so&#xD;
we will give our pictures to Aunt Elinor to hang in&#xD;
our parlor. Let's be taken in costume. .1 detest&#xD;
those stiff things apropos to nothing. The operators&#xD;
seem to have but one round of ideas : with a. book in&#xD;
one hand, with a pillar on one side, or bolt upright,&#xD;
and staring. Now we will be somebody in particu-&#xD;
lar. We'll be shepherds, we'll be medieval, we'll be&#xD;
Corydon and Phyllis. What do you say to that?"a&#xD;
"Who are Corydon and Phyllis ?" asked'Kitty in-&#xD;
nocently.:&#xD;
Archie, vexed to lose what he considered a deli-&#xD;
cately pointed allusion to their own future, replied&#xD;
petulantly, " I thought everybody knew that ; haven't.&#xD;
you read Milton?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes," answered Kitty; "that is, some of&#xD;
it; we used to parse out of ' Paradise Lost' at school-&#xD;
horrid stuff."&#xD;
You don't like poetry,.then ? "&#xD;
&#xD;
PAUL AND VIRGINIA.2&#xD;
Oh, yes, I like poetry well enough, but I don't&#xD;
call that pokey reading poetry!"&#xD;
"Indeed, what do you call it ? "&#xD;
"I call it preaching done into feet."&#xD;
"Master minds have thought well of the work,&#xD;
however."&#xD;
"I can't help it ; I haven't got a master-mind-I'm&#xD;
a weaker vessel. Why not choose something nice,&#xD;
say 'Paul and Virginia.'&#xD;
" I never read 'Paul and Virginia,'" -replied&#xD;
Archie, sheepishly; "don't know -who they are."&#xD;
"Master minds-. have thought well of the work,&#xD;
however;" echoed Kitty.&#xD;
Archie had, a great mind to be -angry, but thought&#xD;
better of it, and Miss.Walsingham, who highly ap-&#xD;
proved the schetne, settled the point by proposing&#xD;
Prince Almanazar and Lady Delight ;. and they got&#xD;
down Brazen Gates, and _ after studying the story&#xD;
carefully, they decided that as Christabel Goldsmith&#xD;
had not dealt largely in dress-stuffs in her descrip-'&#xD;
tion of her favorites, they might wear anything they&#xD;
liked, so they-carried the distinguishing flowers.&#xD;
Selecting a clear, sunny morning, Aunt Elinor&#xD;
drove in to. Merry Bank, intending to superintend&#xD;
the,,attitudes. Kitty drew close around her the shel-&#xD;
tering watt-proof which hid her dress from the ob-&#xD;
servation of the curious, of which class there are&#xD;
always plenty in our . good village. In fact, it is a&#xD;
chronic wonder to me from 'whence come the groups&#xD;
of idlers which gather around all the -groceries, and&#xD;

haunt the sidewalks ; and how they can afford the&#xD;
tiiefor so much idleness in this work-a-day world.&#xD;
Alighting before the great sign, " Photographic&#xD;
rooms," emphasized by a -hand whose very fat fore-&#xD;
finger points  uncompromisingly  upward;  they.&#xD;
mounted the stairs and stood in the presence of a&#xD;
loose-jointed, lanky youth, who looked 'a trifle aston-&#xD;
ished when he surveyed Kitty's fantastic- attire.&#xD;
" Doyou think you can give us a good picture?"&#xD;
asked Aunt Elinor sharply. -&#xD;
"I, rather expect I can ;- we do mostly.. I sot a&#xD;
woman with a pair of twins standing this morning,&#xD;
and she-said they looked like angels."&#xD;
"We' don't want to look like angels," answered&#xD;
Archie dryly, not especially pleased with the ,stare of&#xD;
the red eyes upon Miss Kitty's loveliness. "Where's&#xD;
your master ? "&#xD;
"My master! I never seen him yet.; I never seen&#xD;
your'n'neither, but I know jest how he looks-.-hoofs&#xD;
and horns, and a tail; smells of brimstone."&#xD;
Aunt. Elinor was vastly amused with the ready&#xD;
change her nephew had got for his airs, and made&#xD;
haste to resume the conversation,&#xD;
"Don't be offended, my good fellow; it was but a&#xD;
figure of speech. This gentleman has been sojourn-&#xD;
ing for years among people Who feel the ,term no af-&#xD;
front ; we simply wish to inquire for Mr Hathaway;-&#xD;
will he be here this morning ? "&#xD;
"No, ma'am, he most probably won't ; but it don't&#xD;
make a mite. of difference : I can do your work just&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
as well as he can. I do take more than half the pic.-&#xD;
tures in this establishment myself. I profess to be a&#xD;
dab at the' business."&#xD;
"Oh, if that is the case, we had better get to work.&#xD;
This morning sun is too favorable to lose.&#xD;
The lanky one was still more dumbfounded when&#xD;
Archie came forth from the masculine robing-room,&#xD;
in short velvet trousers, edged with lace, a' brigand&#xD;
hat and long white plume, and a jaunty, close-fitting&#xD;
jacket of sky blue. Miss Walsingham had costumes&#xD;
enough to fit out a fancy-dress party in her old ward-&#xD;
robes. Kitty was as much surprised as the others;&#xD;
and  they both burst out laughing, which mirthful&#xD;
jollity, together with their youth, beauty, and care-&#xD;
less high-breeding, accustomed to ease and plenty,&#xD;
neither'df which he had ever known, were especially&#xD;
aggravating to the lanky one ; and he began throw-&#xD;
ing the books' about, kicking the pillar, and boxing&#xD;
the deaf ears of the stuffed squirrel who was accus-&#xD;
tomed to do duty in. infant-sittings-(" Look-a-here,&#xD;
baby! see! see ! . whew! whew ! hop, scamper-&#xD;
there, now he.is going-to fly.! oh, watch him  "&#xD;
The attention of the youthful candidates being thus&#xD;
solicited)-to the imminent peril of his inside sawdust.&#xD;
" You'd better go into t'other room, ma'am " said&#xD;
he sourly to Miss Walsingham.  You'll make 'em&#xD;
laff," as he-stalked gloomily.away to fetch the plates.&#xD;
"Now, how shall we fix ourselves-?" asked Kitty,&#xD;
enjoying the fun and striking a variety of fancy atti-&#xD;
tudes.&#xD;

"I should lketo fix myself here," replied Archie,&#xD;
dropping on one knee, and clasprig his hands in a&#xD;
troubadour position.&#xD;
"You have no warrant for that in the story,"spoke&#xD;
up Kitty, blushing a little, and rather liking it too.&#xD;
"You must keep to your part. Musn'the, auntie ? '&#xD;
" I think it would be the death of that poor young&#xD;

Kitty hurriedly.&#xD;

proof of my esteem."&#xD;

ments of the water-lilies so necessary to tricky&#xD;
Johnny and the peerless Lady Delight; after sundry&#xD;
tiltings up Kitty's chin with his damp and rather&#xD;
dirty hand by the lanky one, who was chewing some-&#xD;

some secret hole behind the blue screen, and his face&#xD;
cleared'apace as his'stomach filled and he chewed the&#xD;
cud with- relish,; perhaps after all it was over-work&#xD;
which made him so crusty and glum), "You cross&#xD;
one foot over t'other, the toe down so," said he to&#xD;
Kitty, adjusting his own lean legs to illustrate the po-&#xD;
sition. "And you straighten back a little,'-to&#xD;
t  "  "  A/&#xD;
&#xD;
Archie, who moved not the fraction- of a" hair.. "Well,&#xD;
if you want to be took as crooked as a ram's horn, it&#xD;
is immeticular to me- Now, I'm all ready," he con-&#xD;
cluded, pulling his head out from under the black&#xD;
cloth. "Look as pleasant as you can, and wink 'as&#xD;
often as you please!"&#xD;
Kitty tried her best, but it would come,; the water-&#xD;
lilies nodded in her fingers, her lips parted, and an&#xD;
uncontrollable gust of merriment burst forth.&#xD;
"There, ma'am ! I told you you'd make 'em laff,"&#xD;
expostulated . the lanky one, glowering on  Aunt'&#xD;
Elinor, who had caught the contagion, and was join .&#xD;
ing heartily; "you'll have to leave, or we shan't get a&#xD;
picture all day."&#xD;
"Oh! you. consider fme a subject of 'ethereal&#xD;
mirth.' Well, I will retire, and take with me 'jest and&#xD;
jocund jollity, quips, and cranks, and wilful wiles,&#xD;
nods and becks, and wreathed smiles."&#xD;
'And trip it lightly as you go, on the light, fantas-&#xD;
tic toe,'" said Archie, springing forward, and waltz-&#xD;
ing the stout lady out of the room.&#xD;
"I wonder if these folks came out of a crazy house,"&#xD;
grumbled lanky. "I never see such a packof lunie;&#xD;
whenever you get through prancing round,I'nready&#xD;
to try again. I've got an appointment with a min-&#xD;
ister to-day. Now then, see ifFyou can look right&#xD;

placing it at a convenient distance:&#xD;
" But I'tl rather look here," replied Archie, turning&#xD;
towards Kitty.&#xD;

" I -can't take your eyes .so.  -&#xD;
"I, don't think you could take my eye any way,"&#xD;
answered Archie, insolently facing about, much dis-&#xD;
pleased with the tone, and also the evident admira-&#xD;
tion of the lanky one shown for his fair partner.&#xD;
The operator bristled up, and made a feint of cour-&#xD;
age, enough to- frighten simple Kitty; but eying&#xD;
over the broad :shoulders and powerful fists, which&#xD;
the young gentleman knew quite well how to use, he&#xD;
changed his mind, and subsided into internal swearing.&#xD;
It was a Work of patience. At each removal of&#xD;
the plate to the secret hole, came a voice from the&#xD;
depths, "both moved ; one moved," and.that, too,&#xD;
when each felt sure of having been still to a rmnuscle ;&#xD;
till Kitty got tired of standing on one foot, and&#xD;
'wanted to give it up altogether, when Mr. Hathaway&#xD;
appeared upon the scene, and brushing. aside the&#xD;
lanky one, took the business into his own hands, and&#xD;
having an artist's eye, as well as powers of execution,&#xD;
quickness, adaptation, precision, and other traits&#xD;
necessary to his profession, he soon gave them a pic-&#xD;
ture which he pronounced a success. Aunt Elinor&#xD;
knewthe gentleman wellkand liked him; she had&#xD;
watched his toward course, his artist-struggles,.had&#xD;
bought hisspictures, and given him a sitting for her&#xD;
face in oils, andl while. they were waiting for the neg-&#xD;
ative she entered into conversation with him, watch-&#xD;
ing his dark, rathermelancholy face. with its soft,&#xD;
black eyes, and.,thoughtful mouth, with interest in&#xD;
what he was saying.&#xD;

"To Rome ! " said she, "and leave this lucrative&#xD;
business to study art ? "&#xD;
"I dream of it-sometimes," he answered sadly,&#xD;
"but I believe I shall never see Rome till: I look down&#xD;
upon it from heaven."&#xD;
. " When you study the celestial pictures, you will&#xD;
fil your sodlso full of beauty, that old Rome will be&#xD;
forgotten," answered the lady ; and while- she spoke&#xD;
she turned over in her mind the feasibility"of dis-&#xD;
patching this ardent art-lover to the land of his&#xD;
dreams, and resolved to consult Archie: about it as&#xD;
soon as they reached home. Aunt Elinor, with her&#xD;
sympathetic woman's heart, knew well the ecstatic&#xD;
delight of fulfilling the desires of people who are&#xD;
worth the trouble ; and after summing up all the uses&#xD;
of money, what investment pays so well ? " Now that&#xD;
you are here," she concluded briskly, " I shall have~a&#xD;
little ivory-type for myself. Take off that hat, child,&#xD;
and smooth your curls. . I like my friends, as I know&#xD;
them best. Now, .Mr. Hartaway, do your prettiest ;&#xD;
I have provided a nice little sitter, and I expect per-&#xD;
fection in the semblance."&#xD;
"He'll have to. go out, sir," suggested the lanky&#xD;
one, determined to have a last fling at Archie'; "he&#xD;
makes 'em laff."-=&#xD;
The first trial was a glorious success ; sweet, pure,&#xD;
and lovely she looked at them. Kitty at Kitty's&#xD;

ear, at which the -conscious maid blushed red as a&#xD;

The lanky one coughed a rasping, barking cough,&#xD;
which sounded like a growl, and shuffled off to the&#xD;

"If she likes, as a memory-trial; but as she recites&#xD;
ten verses 'of the New Testament to me every even-&#xD;

She is getting'her creed straight from the Fountain-&#xD;

' "What would you like, then ? name the treasure--&#xD;

anxious to see your feet safely planted on the, Say-&#xD;

"Where's that?" demanded Kitty innocently.&#xD;
"-Here's a little heathen for you ! " exclaimed&#xD;
Archie; "poor, neglected infant."&#xD;
"Calling names isn't Christianity," retorted Kitty.&#xD;
"Answered like a woman. I shall keep to the&#xD;
text hereafter, 'what do ye lack ?' like a Scotch&#xD;
pedler."&#xD;
" I want to ride Dandy ! jur'np him over the five-&#xD;
bar, where you 'went this morning ; he was- so mean,&#xD;
auntie ! he leaped over, and made me wait till he&#xD;
had opened the gate, before I could go through."&#xD;
"Yes, you wanted to break your neck, and as it is&#xD;
toshort to join again, -I objected, from motives of&#xD;
economy."g&#xD;
"Well, I won't learn the catechism unless you will&#xD;
give me a ride on Dandy."&#xD;
Shall I risk it, auntie ? "&#xD;
"Why not? Kitty rides wel, and Dandy is a good&#xD;
jrnper."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Very well, I shift all responsibility, and you shall&#xD;
try your skill just as soon.as you are perfect."&#xD;
"" ut if1 I miss two questions," said-Kitty, turning&#xD;
over the leaves of the yimer Archie presented heit;&#xD;
" that used to be perfect at school."&#xD;
"I'll make it one. I don't want, to be -a hard&#xD;
master," replied Archie blandly.&#xD;
" I'll be ready by four o'clock, and have the ride&#xD;
this evening."&#xD;
" At blushing shut of day-.agreed."&#xD;
All the morning Kitty studied the questions, and&#xD;
conned over the answers; and flushed with triumph&#xD;
she presented her book to the young catechist before&#xD;
the hall clock struck four. " I've got 'them all," said&#xD;
she.&#xD;
"Very well, we'lr'see-who was the first man?"&#xD;
" Adam."&#xD;
"Who killed Cain?"&#xD;
" Abel."&#xD;
" One miss! take your book and study" (very&#xD;
severely).&#xD;
" You' shan't count that, Archie ; you didn't ask&#xD;
the question right ; it is who was the first murderer?"&#xD;
"So it is--.well, I will excuse that failure-; now who&#xD;
was the strongest man ;" and so. on : they advanced'&#xD;
swimmingly, till Archie propounded the query,&#xD;
"Who, was the last man-?"&#xD;
".Now you are too bad to skip about so, and.ask&#xD;
the very one I didn't learn;" said Kitty, quite cast&#xD;
down and discouraged.&#xD;

A hearty laugh from Aunt Elinor set the faithful&#xD;
pupil thinking.  "There isn't any last man," ex-&#xD;
claimed she, clapping her hands gleefully, "and I'll&#xD;
have my ride on.Danday."&#xD;
"I can convince you that you are, mistaken," re-&#xD;
plied Archie, fetching a-volume of Campbellfrom the&#xD;
library.  "I've "got the ipse (dixit of a fellow who&#xD;

'I saw a vision in my sleep&#xD;
That gave my spirit strength to sweep&#xD;
Adown the vale of time.&#xD;
I saw the last of human mould&#xD;
That shall creation's death behold,&#xD;
As Adam saw its prime.'"&#xD;
The young man finished the poem, to which Kitty&#xD;
listened with fixed attention.&#xD;
"There I Miss Kitty," asked he, shutting the&#xD;
book ; " what do you think of that ?-"&#xD;
" It makes me creep a little," said Kitty, shiver-&#xD;
ing; "but I like it ; it sounds like a grand anthem-&#xD;
like solemn church music-it is like a gorgeous paint-&#xD;
ing. I'd rather learn that than your stupid old cate-&#xD;
chism."&#xD;
"Well, I give up ! " exclaimed Archie. " I ex-&#xD;

" You can't sometimes almost always tell these&#xD;
young maidens' thoughts, thou man. Elegance for-&#xD;

Elinor, laughing and patting Kitty's cheek.  "They&#xD;

don't admire and reject by rule and pummet, but are&#xD;
quite apt to be a law unto themselves. Go and get&#xD;
ready for your ride, darling ; enjoy the pleasure you&#xD;

ERHAPS the pleasantest times this couple&#xD;
enjoyed were the long talks over the career.&#xD;
Mr. Laurie was to make ; a something great&#xD;
glorious, in which they had joint interest; which&#xD;
amwas discussed in all its bearings, and admired in the&#xD;
prophetic gloty of its magnificent results.  Miss&#xD;
Walsingham took infinite comfort, watching, petting,&#xD;
lecturing, and helping. She made them work, too,&#xD;
doing her best to interest her nephew in the manage-&#xD;
ment and capabilities of her Quince Bush; and in-&#xD;
sisted that he should assume direction of her work-&#xD;
people; and she plied him early and late with en-&#xD;
treaties to remain and superintend the property-&#xD;
making that his business.&#xD;
"It will all be yours, Archie," she said. "You&#xD;
should look after your own. What more noble and&#xD;

a Miss Walsingham met an unexpected rebuff; for,&#xD;
on confiding her. troubles to Kitty, that .little maid&#xD;
blushingly, but quite firmly, owned that "she agreed&#xD;
with Archie ; she thought he was just right."  So&#xD;
good Aunt Elinor was obliged to give in at last,&#xD;
withmany sighs over her lonely home, where she&#xD;
dreaded to miss the presence of the gay young peo-&#xD;
ple at her table, so splendid and solitary, that even&#xD;
her cat was an acceptable companion, and she re-&#xD;
solved to keep Kitty just as long as she could.&#xD;

KITTY'S FIRST OFFER.&#xD;
AMBLING together one evening beneath the&#xD;
golden harvest moon, chatting and enjoying&#xD;
themselves after their usual fashion, Archie&#xD;
broke out suddenly-&#xD;
" Kitty, I've had an offer."&#xD;
"An offer !" replied Kitty, quite mystified.&#xD;
"Yes, and 'I want your advice ; shall I or shall I&#xD;
not pounce upon it?-"&#xD;
" I would do just as I thought best, Archie."&#xD;
"You provoking little bo-peep! why don't you ask&#xD;
me some questions?"&#xD;
Oh, I can wait;' if you have anything to tell, I&#xD;
shall get it fast enough."&#xD;
I have something to tell, Kitty. Iam about'to&#xD;
leave you."&#xD;
"Leave me !" echoed Kitty, faintly.&#xD;
"Ah! I thought I could surprise you. I hate to&#xD;
&#xD;
go. I hate to disoblige Aunt Elinor. I hate to in-&#xD;
terrupt our pleasant life, like a dream of Arcadia;&#xD;
but I don't feel like abandoning my life's design.&#xD;
The career must be made ! Such an excellent op-,&#xD;
portunity offers now, that I can't think it right to&#xD;
give it the go-by. You will miss me, won't you,&#xD;
Kitty? We've had nice timeshaven't we ? I must&#xD;
speak this evening to Aunt Elinor."&#xD;
After waiting a little while in a silence which Kitty&#xD;
could not find voice to break, Archie said, " Do-you&#xD;
know, Kitty, I almost wish I was rich."&#xD;
"Why so, Archie ? " she answered softly.&#xD;
"Because if I had money of-my own we might get&#xD;
married right away, and make the career together af-&#xD;
terward. Wouldn't that be pleasant? I declare I&#xD;
am sorely tempted to give in to my aunt's wishes,&#xD;
and settle down and let the old career go. hang !&#xD;

"You are taking a great deal for granted, Mr.&#xD;

Dropping the gay, bantering tone he had been&#xD;

swift blushes chased each other over her cheeks, and&#xD;
her true eyes dropped beneath his earnest look. Al-&#xD;
though he felt quite sure of her, he wished ;to hear&#xD;

"Archie, I love you dearly. I will be ready when-.&#xD;

MEETING ANGELS UNA WARES.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
MEETING ANGELS UNAWARES.&#xD;
&#xD;
T was a brilliant morning when Archie Laurie&#xD;
walked into the law office in Toptown (the&#xD;
county seat, where we have our court-house,&#xD;
jail, insane-retreat, poor-house, and all sorts of civi-&#xD;
lizative conveniences), which was to'be the theatre of&#xD;
his bold attempts to achieve greatness.  It was a&#xD;
brilliant morning,and his pulse-beats kept joyous&#xD;
time to his jubilant mood. Blessed with high health&#xD;
and an untouched constitution his young blood ran&#xD;
sparkling through his veins like     agne wine.&#xD;
He.st epped off'his walk of five miles from t e team-&#xD;
boat landing, like an athlete in full training. He. ad&#xD;
written to Kitty, in his' cramped, little-state-roo,&#xD;
annoIncing his arrival in a strain of exhilarated glad-&#xD;
ness, which kept her singing for very joy for days&#xD;
afterward. A little time of steady attention to his&#xD;
&#xD;
new business sufficed to put him au courant in its&#xD;
detail. The position was an excellent one. The old-&#xD;
est house in town had offered him a partnership,&#xD;
and with diligence and industry his much-talked-of&#xD;
" career " was sure to be achieved. . He settled ab-&#xD;
sorbedly to his work. Richard Roe and John Doe&#xD;
with their never-ending disputes could not disgust&#xD;
him. He read-voraciously, and wrote reams upon&#xD;
reams of dry cases, as though it were mere pastime.&#xD;
In short, he battered away at the Brazen Gates with&#xD;
sounding blows which made them reel again.&#xD;
Alas ! for the chances and changes in this ever-&#xD;
whirling world. Man proposes, but it seems as if the&#xD;
disposing came from down below, sometimes ; at any&#xD;
rate, an evil spirit presented herself in the'garb of an&#xD;
angel of light. Strolling one evening into the long&#xD;
dining-room of the hotel where he boarded, he sat&#xD;
down to table, and had just finished helping himself&#xD;
to a huge saucer of late peaches, and was carefully&#xD;
sifting them with sugar, thinking about a law-suit of&#xD;
which he was writing up the evidence, when, with a&#xD;
silken rustle, and a faint breath of heliotrope floating&#xD;
about her, Mrs. Nickson, nee Brandon, seated herself&#xD;
at his elbow. She was alone, and looking radiantly&#xD;
beautiful. Her steely eyes glimmered when they&#xD;

world ? They soon sailed.into pleasant seas of talk:&#xD;
of the grand party, the wedding, Merry Bank peo-&#xD;
ple, the Red Cottageites ; and, tea over, what more&#xD;
natural than that he should accompany the handsome,&#xD;
charming lady, the brilliant. causeure, who was in&#xD;
some sort an old acquaintance-almost a friend--&#xD;
into the parlor, where, to say truth, he spent the en-&#xD;
tire evening listening to her sparkling conversation ;&#xD;
perhaps unconsciously admiring and wondering at&#xD;
her rare beauty-which was set in array for his bene-&#xD;
fit. Of ,course Mrs., Nickson sang. Archie didn't&#xD;
consider himself a great enthusiast in music, but&#xD;
those songs thrilled through his soul.  He begged&#xD;
for one  more, and   one more, long   after all&#xD;
loungers had deserted the parlor, and they two&#xD;
were left alone. He thought a dozen times about&#xD;
going, but she had a little more to say, and .she&#xD;
looked so handsome saying it, that he forgot the&#xD;
flight of time in listening, and his watch showed him&#xD;
the small hours before he undid its guard-chain and&#xD;
adjusted its key for the winding ; and her face was&#xD;
before him; her entertaining talk, her musical voice&#xD;
lingered about his thoughts till the image of death&#xD;
locked fast his senses. Poor little Kitty went to&#xD;
sleep that night with- the joyous, loving letter from&#xD;
her betrothed under her white pillow, first praying a&#xD;
prayer for him, and she slept a sweet and dreamless&#xD;
slumber.&#xD;
Mrs. Nickson's jockey husband had gone to the&#xD;
Brooklyn races, where he had entered the Belle&#xD;
&#xD;
marriage had no controlling.. power over him-they&#xD;
say reformed rakes make the best husbands;&#xD;
don't you believe it, girls ; it can't be- so ; mended&#xD;
china isn't so good as unbroken china ; mended&#xD;
manners are not so trustworthy as life-long purity.&#xD;
But John Nickson was not reformed-had no idea of&#xD;
being-and his handsome, wife did not in the least&#xD;
trouble herself about his morals, so long as he gave&#xD;
her plenty of banknotes. The Folly was undergo-&#xD;
ing a thorough burnishing before it could receive its&#xD;
splendid mistress, who meant to have the full value-&#xD;
of her " most filthy bargain " in everything that money&#xD;
could buy ; and here she was at the hotel, with noth-&#xD;
ing in hand, till the banker's return. Only a few&#xD;
weeks married, and she had hours of hearty disgust&#xD;
with her wedded life-and she bitterly regretted&#xD;
what she was now disposed to consider over-haste in&#xD;
her decision ; and she vainly wished that she had&#xD;
stayed for one more chance. The time had already&#xD;
gone by when she was at the least pains to conceal&#xD;
how disgusting was her husband to her; how abhor-&#xD;
rent his habits. All the horse-talk to which she afore-&#xD;
time so llandjy listened was received with cold&#xD;
shoulders and open sneers. His chosen companions&#xD;
she would none of, and they dared not come into&#xD;
her presence. She. had already proved, to her ex-&#xD;
treme surprise, that there could be weariness and&#xD;
ennui in spending money. The golden apple she&#xD;

had plucked so eagerly was turning to ashes in her&#xD;
hand, and   a whole, long life yet before her.&#xD;
Of course, she willingly seized upon Archie Laurie&#xD;
for occupation, and he, poor fellow,' with his' high&#xD;
trust in woman, had not the ghost of a chance to&#xD;
resist her wiles. A few adroit conversations made&#xD;
her perfectly au fait as to the state of his heart.&#xD;
He easily confided all his plans, and she led him on&#xD;
and drew him out by the beautiful sympathy she&#xD;
manifested, and the fervent praises of" dear, sweet&#xD;
Kitty."&#xD;
The handsome plotter remembered with bitter re-&#xD;
sentment every event of the great party where she&#xD;
had suffered such unbearable mortifications, though&#xD;
she had so gushingly gone over its delights with him&#xD;
on the first evening of their meeting ; and shere-'&#xD;
solved to captivate this young fellow-half for the&#xD;
pleasure of resuming her favorite amusement, which&#xD;
she called "flirting," and partly 'to punish Kitty&#xD;
Clayton for everything she had suffered while in that&#xD;
innocent maid's society. She busied herself making&#xD;
natural opportunities to meet Archie, and to bring&#xD;
him to her side. She flattered him by showing in-&#xD;
tense interest in his business, his plans, his future.&#xD;
While she praised Kitty, she thrust her .own beauties&#xD;
and graces upon his attention, so that he'could not&#xD;
help being impressed with them. She set off her at-&#xD;
tractions by brilliant toilettes. She smiled her ador-&#xD;
able smiles, and breathed out her perfumed breath in&#xD;
pretty sighs, while-she bewailed the lottery of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
"So many draw blanks,'" she said, and shook her&#xD;
head with its floating curls, and sang to him a plain-&#xD;
tive song which thrilled to his heart's core. She&#xD;
talked trippingly-laughing threaded melody, while&#xD;
he held her bright-colored worsteds. He could, not&#xD;
help observing her round arms and charming dimples,&#xD;
as she supplely bent hither and thither in the wind-&#xD;
ing. She paraded her graces, practised the allure-&#xD;
ments it had been her life-work to make perfect, and&#xD;
she threw a cruel glamour over the lad before he knew&#xD;
that he'was in danger. She rejoiced wickedly when&#xD;
she saw how the image of sweet Kitty was obscured&#xD;
in her gorgeous .presence.  No respect for herself&#xD;
r held her in check. She had never followed her avo-&#xD;
cation with richer zest or fuller enjoyment. It was&#xD;
more than flirting now ; it was also revenge, and she&#xD;
gloried in the -'sorrow she was brewing for Kitty,&#xD;
whom she hated in exact proportion to the favors she&#xD;
had received from her hands.&#xD;
As for Archie Laurie, his latter years had .been&#xD;
passed among his own sex, engrossed in his studies,&#xD;
his sports, his travels-which had left him neither&#xD;
time nor opportunities to study women. Thus put-&#xD;
ting a wide gap between his school-boy life at Merry&#xD;
Bank, when, girls were -only girls and nothing more,&#xD;
and now, when womeri were mostly angels without&#xD;
wings.&#xD;
Every hour the infatuated youth could command,&#xD;
he passed by the side of the Married Belle. Every&#xD;
thought was claimed by her, without any design to&#xD;

be false to his love. She had slid insensibly into the&#xD;
background, out of sight ; lie nearly forgot to write&#xD;
to her. In fact, Mrs. Nickson did not give him time.&#xD;
One evening she came upon him reading Chatterton.&#xD;
He laid down the volume to converse with her ; in&#xD;
fact, hehad only been beguiling the tedium of wait-&#xD;
ing for her appearance. She did not ask him-what&#xD;
occupied him, but took an opportunity to steal a&#xD;
glance at the title, and the next morning she rose&#xD;
early and fetched the works of "the marvellous boy,&#xD;
the sleepless soul that perished in his pride."-and at&#xD;
their -next sitting she adroitly led the talk toward&#xD;
him, and showed herself so thoroughly conversant&#xD;
with his stormy life and its strange work, that Archie&#xD;
was impressed with her erudition, and paid her many&#xD;
compliments upon acquirements not common among&#xD;
women, and when she repeated the whole hymn be-&#xD;
ginring "Almighty Framer of the skies," so melo-&#xD;
diously and with such true devotion, he could have&#xD;
knelt at her feet. If Belle had taken as much trouble&#xD;
to minister to the tastes and-enjoyments of her hus-&#xD;
band, as she did to study and fascinate this youth,&#xD;
she might have lived comfortably 'with him, -and&#xD;
perhaps have kindled within him some new desires&#xD;
after home pleasures, some-notions-of refinement and&#xD;
manliness.  I say, perhaps, but she had no such&#xD;
leaning-no such intention.&#xD;
Things had'been going on thus for weeks, when&#xD;
one evening after tea Archie was sitting on the bal-&#xD;
cony of his hotel enjoying his segar and the autumnal&#xD;
&#xD;
,{    -&#xD;
&#xD;
coloring on the distant woods. He was alone for a&#xD;
wonder;- Mrs. Nickson was shopping. , He pulled -&#xD;
out his handkerchief, and with it came a tiny glove,&#xD;
smelling of heliotrope. He had stolen it from the&#xD;
Married Belle the evening before, on their return from&#xD;
a concert, at which time she had been bewilderingly&#xD;
bewitching. The faint perfume reminded him of 'her&#xD;
in her floating robes-of her sweeping curls, her won-&#xD;
derful eyes, rosy mouth, sharp white teeth, and beau-&#xD;
tiful dimples; of her, leaning on his . arm,- walking&#xD;
with easy, springing grace by his side home through&#xD;
the quiet street ; of her sitting at the piano-of the&#xD;
air she had warbled in his'charmed ears. The liquid&#xD;
melody of her glorious v ice still lingered about him&#xD;
like enchantment ; unc nsciously he hummed the-&#xD;
words of her song :&#xD;
."In earth or air, a thing so fair,&#xD;
I have not seen as thee."&#xD;
A servant approached. and handed him  a small&#xD;
package.&#xD;
"By express, sir ; fifty cents."&#xD;
Archie took it, paid the charge, and after turning&#xD;
it over in-his hands a moment, as everybody does a&#xD;
bundle or a letter, for some unexplained reason, he&#xD;
opened it, with his cigar in the corner of his mouth and&#xD;
his head much on'one side, to shirk the smoke which&#xD;
wreathed about his half-shut eyes, not greatly inter-&#xD;
ested in what he was doing, and still dreaming vaguely&#xD;
of the glea ing glances. A little;ivory picture met&#xD;

&#xD;
his gaze when the last wrapping was removed. He&#xD;
dropped it from his hands, appalled and conscience-.&#xD;
stricken. The words of the enchantress' song died&#xD;
on his lips. "My God !" he exclaimed. "Can&#xD;
this be Archie -aurie ?"&#xD;
It was nothing frightful, however, that fixed his&#xD;
look, only a sweet, pure, little, childish face, shaded&#xD;
by soft curls and lighted by loving, trustful eyes.&#xD;
He turned sick and. cold. Well, he had to face a very&#xD;
unpleasant verity : here was a good young fellow, who&#xD;
had always lived on the best terms with himself, ac-&#xD;
customed to feel infinite respect and complaisance for&#xD;
his manhood, as he acknowledged it, rather fallen away&#xD;
from  the narrow path of rectitude ; rather slipped&#xD;
loose from candid honor; he who had so loftily denied&#xD;
all possibility of change or forgetfulness when asked a&#xD;
simple question by a simple girl, speaking in proud&#xD;
haste and assured certainty, was suddenly brought up&#xD;
with a round turn by a little picture that he was&#xD;
obliged to lift again and hold in his hand, and which&#xD;
he could not take his eyes off of, and couldn't look at&#xD;
without blushing.  Kitty Clayton, in her precious&#xD;
youth, gentle, winning, tender, leaning on his breast&#xD;
under the yellow harvest moon, came back into his.&#xD;
thoughts, stole back softly,: where she had a right to&#xD;
be : all her quaint prettiness and fresh innocence was&#xD;
there. Her lovely presence care once again, flutter--&#xD;
ing and fearful, into his soul. He dashed down the&#xD;
perfumed glove, softly hid away the picture, and cov-&#xD;
cred his face with his hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some persons were talking together in coarse tones&#xD;
within the tree-shaded nook below him, where they&#xD;
were lounging and smoking in arm-chairs.&#xD;
"I say, Knox, what a luscious piece of flesh old&#xD;
Nick has got for a mate this time! she beats the&#xD;
-others by a long stride."&#xD;
"He ought to be a judge of the article. By hokey!&#xD;
he's had experience enough among the fillies."&#xD;
"I'll bet on this one against the field, she won't&#xD;
hang herself or cut her throat, as t'others did. I re-&#xD;
member the night he first seen her; 'twas to a fair;&#xD;
he left a fiver in the box on her table for a cup of&#xD;
coffee he drank :. he was just mad to wait then and&#xD;
see her again. I didn't think the cards would ever&#xD;
turn .up such a trick as they did, though ; she's a&#xD;
match for the devil in his brimstone clothes, any day&#xD;
in the week."&#xD;
"Oh ! not so bad as that, you know. I call her a&#xD;
confounded fine. woman ; you mustn't lash out be-&#xD;
cause she turned- the cold shoulder on you ; haw !&#xD;
hai! They will do that sort of thing, you know;&#xD;
those high-strung ones are devilish apt to snap, at a&#xD;
raw hand."&#xD;
"Blast her shoulders ! I hate her ; she told me&#xD;
with her nose in the air that she did not wish to en-&#xD;
tertain any of Mr. Nickson's jockey associates. She&#xD;
wasn't- fond of stable odors, and I'm blessed. if the&#xD;
impudent jade didn't put her handkerchief to her&#xD;
nose and-turn her back upon me. By Judas ! she'll&#xD;
'come down a peg yet; old Nick is betting like thun-&#xD;

der; and I'm just the fellow that won't say 'whoa.'&#xD;
Let him spin.; silks and satins look fine on my.hand-&#xD;
some dame but I should like to see how rags would&#xD;
become her."&#xD;
"Splitting fun to watch what a fool she is making&#xD;
of that young lawyer. It is as good as a play the&#xD;
way she leads him by the nose, like a tame bear.&#xD;
Golly ! wouldn't I like to be round when old Nick&#xD;
gets wind of Ijer goings on."&#xD;
"Oh! he knows all about her. I was at Newport&#xD;
when they was, and he was as proud as a peacock of&#xD;
his new bargain; didn't she dress, though ! There&#xD;
wasn't a woman there that could hold a candle to her,&#xD;
and she flirted day in and day out, riding here, driv-&#xD;
ing there, with a train of men around her as long as&#xD;
a flock of wild geese."&#xD;
" I don't care nothing about that. I tell you,&#xD;
Knox, she'd better mind her eye; if Nick gets down&#xD;
on anybody, they had as good say their prayers."&#xD;
Poor Archie ! fallen from his high estate to be a&#xD;
byword and 'a laughing-stock to 'keys and gam-&#xD;
blers!&#xD;
A handsome carriage and pair drew up before the&#xD;
hotel. The tall coachman pulled' in his high-step-&#xD;
ping-bays with a jerk, to the admiration of the crowd&#xD;
of smokers and loungers. The Married Belle sat in her&#xD;
purple-lined phaeton, in perfect costume, her blonde&#xD;
curls floating beneath a jaunty hat, whose long white,&#xD;
plume covered her shoulder ; her velvet basque fitted&#xD;
perfectly her beautiful figure, and a certain air of con-&#xD;
&#xD;
MEETING ANGELS UNAWARES.&#xD;
&#xD;
275&#xD;
&#xD;
fident triumph showed in her graceful pose. When&#xD;
she caught sight of the foolish lad she had spent so&#xD;
many enchantments to make wretched, she smiled at&#xD;
the bowed head and exulted. "lHe is in a fit of ten-&#xD;
der musing, of which Iam the sun and glory; " so she&#xD;
thought as she spoke to her coachman.&#xD;
' "Alphonse, you may give the reins to Mr. Laurie ;&#xD;
he is.fond of driving my horses. You must get new&#xD;
rosettes for this harness to-morrow, and a fresh pair of&#xD;
lines. I will have nothing pass or dingy about my&#xD;
turn-out."&#xD;
Alphonse swung his legs to the ground and stood&#xD;
ready to resign his charge, but he: listened to the&#xD;
orders of his handsome mistress with a careless, inso-&#xD;
lent indifference, which showed that he did not like&#xD;
her service. The men in the arm-chairs were weigh-&#xD;
ing her, add boldly staring-she, with her haughty&#xD;
disregard of.those beneath her in the social scale, en-&#xD;
tirely ignored their existence, and called out to Archie&#xD;
in her subdued, musical voice, as if they had not been&#xD;
within hearing:&#xD;
"Come, Mr. Laurie ! just the time for a drive; be&#xD;
quick, please, the bays are so impatient ; " and she&#xD;
nodded and smiled as she gathered up her rich robes&#xD;
to give him room beside her.&#xD;
Yesterday the boldness of the -action might have&#xD;
passed for gushing simplicity, and he would have ac-&#xD;
cepted. the invitation so unblushingly offered, and&#xD;
have heartily enjoyed managing the spirited steeds,&#xD;
and listening to the brilliant conversation of the mag,&#xD;

nificent woman beside him, as he had done often and&#xD;
often before; but to-day ! her spell was broken: with&#xD;
a sudden waking as from a dream, he beheld her as&#xD;
she was,. a bold, unscrupulous woman, obstinately&#xD;
seeking her own pleasure in open defiance of all right&#xD;
and honor, and he shrank from her with loathing.&#xD;
The handsome plotter felt instantly that her prey&#xD;
had slipped out of her net. She saw it in his averted,&#xD;
unsmiling face, herd it in his changed tones, even&#xD;
before he had finished putting his refusal into words;&#xD;
but she sat an instant looking at him with Geraldine&#xD;
eyes, and the Scripture-reading in the old Red Cot..&#xD;
tage sounded in her ears like a sentence of condem-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
"Though thou clothest thyself with crimson,&#xD;
though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold,&#xD;
though thou tentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt&#xD;
thou make thyself fair. Thy lovers will despise thee.&#xD;
And thou saidst, I shall be a lady forever., For thou&#xD;
hast trusted-in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None&#xD;
seeth me. Therefore shall evil come upon thee, and&#xD;
desolation shall come upon thee suddenly."&#xD;
Archie had turned from   her and disappeared&#xD;
through the long window before a suppressed "haw!&#xD;
haw!" from the jockeys and gamblers in the arm-&#xD;
chairs brought her back from the unpleasant, profit-&#xD;
less past, home to the doleful, unsatisfactory present,&#xD;
and a queer: look in the eyes of her showy coachman&#xD;
gave it force and fire, proving how keenly he appre-&#xD;
ciated and, enjoyed his mistress' position.&#xD;
&#xD;

It was a terrible glance that Belle gave the man.&#xD;
"All was blight; Lamia, no longer fair, sat there, a&#xD;
deadly white."  Her pale lips hardly- seemed to form&#xD;
the words of her order,:and the glitter of her sharp&#xD;
teeth through the livid cleft was uncanny enough to&#xD;
make you turn chilly.&#xD;
"Drive on, fool. Are you taking root, that- you&#xD;
cannot leave- the place ? Do you hear me ? drive&#xD;
on."&#xD;
" Where, ma'am ? "&#xD;
"To the lake, to the glen, to the church-yard."&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am," replied Alphonse, and mutteringly&#xD;
added: "Post to the devil everywheres."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
BASSWOOD VERSUS HICKORY.&#xD;
S for Mr. Archie Laurie, he walked rapidly&#xD;
down toward his officein that most unenvia-&#xD;
ble of all states for a noble-minded man, proud&#xD;
of his strength, when he is forced to. feel himself&#xD;
weighed in the balance and found wanting. He&#xD;
blushed all alone when he reviewed the miserable in-&#xD;
fatuation of the past weeks. "Paugh!" he exclaimed,&#xD;
trying to twist himself away from his thoughts ; "how&#xD;
can a man be such a dishonest fool?"  He tried hard&#xD;
walking, and made a circuit of a couple of miles, but&#xD;
with the pleasant persistence^ that style of reflections&#xD;
are sure to excite; they pursued him like avenging&#xD;
furies.&#xD;
At the door-of the office his senior met him in an&#xD;
angry bustle: "What the deuce kept you so long to-&#xD;
night, Laurie ? of all nights in the year; you're fooling&#xD;

away too much of your time, my boy ; it won't do.&#xD;
You'll have to chop short round or there'll be a fuss&#xD;
in the family. I don't-mince matters, and I tell you it&#xD;
won't do, and I mean it."&#xD;
"You shall not have occasion to say that to me&#xD;
again, Mr. Bradbu'ry," replied Archie, in still excite-&#xD;
ment. "I intend to be all business hereafter."&#xD;
" Humph," ejaculated the old lawyer, tilting up his&#xD;
glasses and curiously eying the young man. "All&#xD;
business, hey ? well, let me tell you, my young friend,&#xD;
the office is a safe place for you, but I've got a'safer;&#xD;
you must post directly off amongst the lumbermen;&#xD;
old Basswood-has sent for me to come and take testi-&#xD;
mony in his great saw-mill case, 'Basswood versus&#xD;
Hickory,' and the very best thing I can do for you is"&#xD;
to send you up immediately."&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Bradbury,''replied Archie, flush-&#xD;
ing under the clear penetrating eyes which were read-&#xD;
ing him, ".I should like nothing better."&#xD;
"That's right, my lad. Fresh frontier life will&#xD;
take the taste out of. your mouth ; help you to throw&#xD;
off the yoke, hey ;'" he slapped poor Archie on the&#xD;
shoulder: "I don't want my. office brought up to&#xD;
notice in a 'crim. con.' case, in which my junior shall&#xD;
figure. Don't say a word. I believe you are a-right-&#xD;
minded lad ; but I'm -afraid you haven't cut your eye-&#xD;
teeth yet. 'I, Wisdom, dwell with Prudence,' you&#xD;
understand."&#xD;
The - angry blood surged up through Archie's&#xD;
heart, and tingled at his fingers' ends; he haughtily&#xD;

withdrew his shoulder from his mentor--his tormen-&#xD;

But the sickening feeling, that his folly had fastened&#xD;
such suspicion on him, made him a mark 'for ,men's&#xD;
wagging tongues, kept him silent, and he stood with&#xD;
dropped eyes, looking and feeling intensely foolish.&#xD;
"Come, come, my boy; don't break down under&#xD;

do you good. There .is one thing about it ; the&#xD;
precious few women up there, and, I will venture to&#xD;
affirm that you won't find a married belle among&#xD;
them."&#xD;
With a good-natured chuckle, the old lawyer shook&#xD;
Archie heartily by the hand, and left him to facilitate&#xD;
his preparations for speedy departure. We too will&#xD;
leave him to the tender mercies of the uncouth lum-&#xD;
bermen and his own avenging reflections.&#xD;
&#xD;
HEN   Belle returned from  her drive, she&#xD;
went straight to her, room, and throwing&#xD;
away her hat, she tore off her ornaments and&#xD;
cast them aside, and pushing back her curls from her&#xD;
burning cheeks, she sat down at the table and leaned&#xD;
her face wearily in her clasped hands. Utter abhor-&#xD;
rence of herself and her life oppressed her soul and&#xD;
weighed her to the earth. It ,was one of those&#xD;
avenging hours which will sometimes sweep'over the&#xD;
most blunted and selfish natures, when the past looks&#xD;
loathly and the future a dreary nothingness.&#xD;
Her jewel-casket stood before her, and after a&#xD;
while she opened it and fingered the rich gems it&#xD;
contained-a part of her bargain. But they had -no&#xD;
charm, and with a bitter, scornful laugh she pushed&#xD;
them  away and bent again to her unwelcome&#xD;
thoughts. During her solitary drive she had-.been&#xD;

regretting her past, purposeless, flirting, despicable,&#xD;
cheating, heathen life? Oh no, not at all ; but her&#xD;
over-haste in jumping into matrimony thus, losing&#xD;
another opportunity to be added to the thousand and&#xD;
one good chances she had pursued after; 'angry,&#xD;
enraged that it was too late to have Archie Lauri9 for&#xD;
her husband ; angry also that, from sorne unexplained&#xD;
cause, he wished to sunder the chains she had taken&#xD;
such pains to forge.             -3-&#xD;
While she sat thus thinking her wicked, unwifely&#xD;
thoughts, her, wedded lord entered her room. She&#xD;
saw his hated figure reflected in the mirror before&#xD;
her, but she did not move. A young, honest, trusty&#xD;
face was in her mind, and she shuddered at the first&#xD;
glimpse she caught of this degraded humanity. He&#xD;
had been drinking, and his voice-was thick when he&#xD;
addressed his lady wife:&#xD;
"Mrs. Nichson, I've got home; I wish to speak&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
He steadied himself against the tall, carved bed-&#xD;
post, and looked at her with drunken gravity out of&#xD;
his bloodshot, sensual eyes.&#xD;
" Do you hear, Mrs. Nickson ? I've got home. I&#xD;
want to speak to you."&#xD;
She turned about for an instant, and took into her&#xD;
consciousness his coarse, hardened face, bloated and&#xD;
red, his swaying figure, with his hands plunged deep&#xD;
in his-pockets, and his tall hat (which was Knox's hat,&#xD;
picked up at random, and vaguely appropriated, and&#xD;
all too large for his bullet head) set tipsyly on one&#xD;

side. She turned away with sick impatience.; even&#xD;
the drunken man perceived the disgust in her face,&#xD;
and it angered him.&#xD;
"You are a devilish fine woman, Mrs. Nickson,"&#xD;
he said, running all his words together: "devilish&#xD;
fine; and I've spent a pool of money on you. Those&#xD;
showy ones are always -'spensive. I'm too old a coon&#xD;
to be fooled. I met Jim Knox coming up; he made&#xD;
a joke and a deuced haw-haw about you and your&#xD;
goings on with that stuck-up puppy of a Laurie. I&#xD;
say you're a devilish fine woman, Mrs. Nickson ; but&#xD;
that kind of thing won't go down. I've married you,&#xD;
and I mean to keep you in order. I'll drive the bays&#xD;
myself, hereafter; if Dolph won't serve your turn."&#xD;
Belle never moved, nor gave the least sign of having&#xD;
heard the drunken voice at her elbow-except a curl&#xD;
of her haughty red lip. Her husband pulled out,&#xD;
after some purposeless fumbling, a- handful of crum-&#xD;
pled papers from his pocket, and threw them down&#xD;
on: the table before her.&#xD;
"I've paid some swinging long bills, but you shall&#xD;
hold up now. Your namesake, curse her! has run&#xD;
me behind, and I'm out of pocket, and you won't&#xD;
waste any more on kickshaws; you've kept it up&#xD;
pretty well since you. got hold of my purse-strings,&#xD;
but, by Jove! you'll stop."&#xD;
The beautiful wife sat as still as a statue ; the bob-&#xD;
bing hand and the winking eyes, stupidly trying to be&#xD;
stern and dignified, concerned her not at all. Her&#xD;
silence enraged him; and he raised his voice:&#xD;

"Do you hear me, madam ?      Your lord and&#xD;
master is speaking to you."&#xD;
" Yes, I hear you ; I must be deaf indeed not to&#xD;
hear such a roar as zyou are executing. It does&#xD;
credit to your lungs; I could understand you better;&#xD;
perhaps,'if your utterance was something clearer."&#xD;
"Then why don't you answer when I talk? By&#xD;

can chatter glib as a magpie, when you take a fancy ;&#xD;
you'd better not stir me up, unless you want to see a&#xD;

She turned her head with careless scorn. "You&#xD;
will oblige me by leaving my apartment ; I can't talk&#xD;
to a drunken man.".&#xD;
" Can't you? hal ha! pretty good ; why, you hand-&#xD;
some fool, you belong, to me ; I have bought and&#xD;

and your dimples and all the beauties you were so&#xD;

disdainfully..&#xD;

woman's leave to do -as I please ; it's your business to&#xD;
trot in the path I point out, and you'd better go easy&#xD;
or it will be the worse for you. I've tamed a woman&#xD;
before you."&#xD;
b       oShe haughtily rose, and. pushed back her chair.&#xD;
Words fail to express the superb insolence of her&#xD;
&#xD;
manner. "Since you seem to fancy my apartments,&#xD;
I will leave them to you. I will recommend you to&#xD;
try to sleep off the brandy you are so odorous of;&#xD;
when you are. less like a brute and more like a man,&#xD;
perhaps I will listen to you."&#xD;
He laughed savagely. "Sit down ! I tell you, sit&#xD;
down. Your grand airsare fine, but they are out of&#xD;
time just now ; keep them till.I want them."&#xD;
She wheeled about and looked him'full in the face;&#xD;
such a look ! such glittering eyes, such sharp white&#xD;
teeth !&#xD;
"If you could know," she said, in a steady, even&#xD;
voice, which never lost its musical ring-'"if- you&#xD;
could but be made to feel how I loathe and despise&#xD;
you at your best, and how disgusting and abomina-&#xD;
bly repulsive you are to me now, in your vile, drun-&#xD;
kenness, you would not wish me to stay where every&#xD;
sense recoils from your hated presence. I could tear&#xD;
my heart out and trample on it when I look at the&#xD;
vile wretch I must hear called my husband-"&#xD;
Her speech was stopped suddenly, for beside him..&#xD;
self, fired with rage by her taunts, her contempt, her&#xD;
overbearing pride, which scornfully ignored him, he.&#xD;
struck her, when she stood confronting him, and still&#xD;
indignantly, provokingly. apart-such a cruel blow,&#xD;
upon her creamy dimpled cheek, as left the prints of&#xD;
all his horny fingers in livid marks upon the tender&#xD;
flesh.&#xD;
For one instant she was still, except a thrill of rage&#xD;
which shivered -through, her ; her red lips parted in a&#xD;

&#xD;
smile ; the devil within her intensified her ferocious,&#xD;
savage beauty'; with one undulating motion she&#xD;
darted toward him, and with a blow of her clenched&#xD;
fist she knocked the big hat down over his face, and&#xD;
catching off her long crimson scaif, she wound it&#xD;
round and round his arms, plunged helplessly into&#xD;
his pockets, and drew it fast with all the strength of&#xD;
her quivering fingers. Almost before the mocking&#xD;
laugh had died from his lips he was bound as firmly&#xD;
to the bedstead-as ever prisoner to the stake. Then&#xD;
taking a costly cashmere long-shawl, one of her hus-&#xD;
band's gifts in the first pride of possession, from the&#xD;
chair where she had carelessly tossed it, when she&#xD;
came in from her drive, she deliberately wound it&#xD;
about him from chin to heel, kneeling before him,&#xD;
and making it firm and sure ; and he stood swathed&#xD;
like a mummy. Then seizing his hat in 'her two hands&#xD;
she dragged it ruthlessly off, regarding no whit his&#xD;
long nose, which suffered cruelly in the transit ; she&#xD;
placed it at his feet on the floor, then stepping back-.&#xD;
ward and spreading her voluminous skirts of rustling&#xD;
silk, she performed an elaborate curtesy.&#xD;
"Perhaps my noble lord and master will think&#xD;
twice the next time between the impulse and the&#xD;
blow; I crave leave to retire and bathe my wounded&#xD;
cheek. I kiss my hand to you. May your shadow&#xD;
never be less ! In fact it couldn't well be, except&#xD;
you were shrouded, for your coffin."&#xD;
Turning with her serpentine glide, she floated eas-&#xD;
ily out of the room, leaving the door open, and sa ed&#xD;
&#xD;
A PAAN Ox TRIVMPZ.&#xD;
down the wide staircase ; her white shoulders thrown&#xD;
back, and her superb head haughtily erect, with a&#xD;
desperate, wicked, regal grace; soon the full tones of&#xD;
her splendid voice swelled out rich and clear from&#xD;
the. parlor below, where stood the concert grand'&#xD;
piano, and her skilful fingers played a jubilant aca,&#xD;
companiment to her pean of triumph. Poor Nickson,&#xD;
left alone, gave vent to his feelings in curses. not&#xD;
loud but deep, and writhed in futile efforts to free&#xD;
himself from his inglorious bonds; but. he could not&#xD;
move a finger. The partner of his joys and sharer&#xD;
of his sorrows had done her work too well. He was .&#xD;
a helpless prisoner, and wad fain to squeal for help;&#xD;
the ties of love began to be painful; so excruciating,&#xD;
in fact, that the agony quite sobered him.. His chum&#xD;
and fellow jockey, Knox, happened to be passing in&#xD;
the hall, and hearing an odd noise, peeped in at the&#xD;
door, to see, as he said, "what's the row." Discover-&#xD;
ing his comrade in such distressful plight, wriggling&#xD;
his head from side to side, goggling his eyes, and&#xD;
gurgling strange oaths, the sight seemed so fraught&#xD;
with mirth, that heedless of his .short-breathed en-&#xD;
treaties for help, he staggered and reeled and shouted&#xD;
and stamped in a frenzy of laughter.&#xD;
"Poor old Nick," he wheezily exclaimed as soon as&#xD;
he could find breath. . " He is turned into a mummy,&#xD;

"Come, just quit that, and unwind these cursed&#xD;

suffering tortures, you infernal Guinea-pig ."&#xD;
Fair and soft, Jacky Frippon; fair and soft. If&#xD;
you call names, I leave you to choke, or get out as&#xD;
you can. You must promise me an extra thousand&#xD;
before I go to work ; my services are worth double&#xD;
the money ; but I'll do the job cheap; say a thou-&#xD;

Not a dime ! you've had your living out of me&#xD;

as he had let one arm free, he got his money, and&#xD;
took good care to give the scarf an extra twist on the&#xD;
other, while the enfranchised hand counted out the&#xD;
bills; and he quite plumed himself upon his modera-&#xD;

not bought, he made such a tale out of the scene,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
LORD FEIGNING'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
ALF an hour had not elapsed since her scene&#xD;
upstairs, and Belle's song was still unfinished,&#xD;
when an elderly man, a little stooping in the&#xD;
shoulders and somewhat bald, whose face showed&#xD;
the wrinkled yellow tinge common to dwellers be-&#xD;
neath the burning tropical sun, entered the long&#xD;
parlor and sat down on a distant chair, where he&#xD;
could enjoy the'music as well as command a view of&#xD;
the singer's face. A gleam of recognition shot from&#xD;
his eyes, and he rose as soon as the jubilation was&#xD;
ended, and approached the piano.&#xD;
' "I believe I am speaking to Miss Brandon," said&#xD;
he.&#xD;
Belle knew him instantly. "And this is Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton," she replied, offering her hand ; "how is my&#xD;
dear Kitty?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I have not seen her yet; in fact, I am on my way&#xD;
to Merry Bank now ; neither have I communicated&#xD;
to my daughter my intention. to pay her a visit. It&#xD;
was an impulsive start which projected me on 'my&#xD;
northward-journey, with which, permit me to. say,&#xD;
Miss Brandon had something to do. You perhaps&#xD;
remember a picture which Kitty sent me, a most&#xD;
speaking likeness! T must have known you any-&#xD;
where. The accompanying letter was also very&#xD;
pleasant. If my little girl had always been so frank,&#xD;
I believe I should have been unable to resist her&#xD;
pleading; and perhaps it would have been better for&#xD;
me ; at any rate the successive visions which she&#xD;
conjured before me, of youth, beauty, accomplish-&#xD;
ments, and social joys, made my thankless life'&#xD;
drearier by contrast, and at last k I resolved to pay&#xD;
you all a visit, to try what my native'air would do&#xD;
for me, endeavor to get out of my club-house rut,&#xD;
and into the old channel of home influence."&#xD;
The conversation, indefinitely _prolonged, made&#xD;
Belle acquainted with several useful points.  Mr.&#xD;
Clayton was a thoroughly refined and presentable&#xD;
gentleman.&#xD;
Mr. Clayton did not know she was married, was&#xD;
not enlightened upon certain money transactions in&#xD;
which Kitty was a sufferer ; his trip North was quite&#xD;
as much to see her--Belle-as the simple chit at the&#xD;
Red Cottage ; and while she sat listening and bril-&#xD;
liantly talking, she revolved some plans in her fertile&#xD;
brain which needed immediate execution. She was&#xD;
&#xD;

LORD FEIGNING'S DA UGITER.  293&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
not one to let time waste between the projection and&#xD;
completion of her schemes ; and as she ,stood before&#xD;
the gentleman to say good-night she also offered her&#xD;
hand with her most-confiding gushingness.&#xD;
I am so glad you are here, Mr. Clayton; I want&#xD;
a .friend. I feel sure none could be safer than Kitty's&#xD;
papa. I see you do not precisely understand my&#xD;
position. I cannot explain to-night ; it is too long a-&#xD;
tale : but to-morrow, if you will permit me-"'&#xD;
A beautiful gush of tears--'" Belle was- so lovely in*&#xD;
tears "--finished her sentence, and she turned away in&#xD;
graceful haste.&#xD;
" Stop one moment ! I implore you, Miss Bran-&#xD;
don."&#xD;
"Not to-night, sir. I must not ; I cannot. See !&#xD;
the people have all left the parlor ; we are quite&#xD;
alone," murmured the blonde ; " to-morrow, may I&#xD;
speak to you here ? I must speak to some friend&#xD;
who will advise me, I am so unhappy."&#xD;
With one fair hand extended, with averted head,&#xD;
and her handkerchief to her eyes, leaving to be seen&#xD;
the -delicate rose of her creamy cheek flushed with&#xD;
grief (she-kept carefully the bruised one in shadow),&#xD;
she floated away, leaving Mr. Glayton quite over-&#xD;
whelmed, and so filled and possessed with her mag-&#xD;
nificent loveliness that no other thought found room&#xD;
in his heart.&#xD;
On reaching her room she discovered the door&#xD;
fast, which was nothing unusual. A feeling, half-&#xD;
amusement, half-dread, made her loiter; thinking of&#xD;
&#xD;
the odd sight she had left there, and which had been&#xD;
quite driven from her mind by stress of later thoughts&#xD;
and new projects, she knocked, and got no answer.&#xD;
A chamber-maid passed.&#xD;
"Please open my door, Jane," said she carelessly ;&#xD;
" I believe Ihave lost my key-oh ! thank you."&#xD;
She waited till the girl was out of sight before she&#xD;
turned the knob. The room was perfectly still and&#xD;
dark ; she moved warily to the match-safe, struck a&#xD;
light, and faced the bed. The crimson scarf she had&#xD;
used in her strange work lay in a glowing heap on&#xD;
the carpet, some loose papers were scattered about,&#xD;
but the prisoner was gone. She remembered then&#xD;
that she had left the door wide open, and she smiled&#xD;
'as she wondered who had been a witness to her hus-&#xD;
band's flight, and how he had procured his release.&#xD;
She approached the table. The thought flashed upon&#xD;
her 'that she had left there, in her absorbing passion,&#xD;
her jewel-casket, and unlocked-a thing which had&#xD;
never happened before. Even the banker was ignor-&#xD;
ant of its contents. Besides rare jewels purchased&#xD;
with his money, there were the accumulations of&#xD;
years ; gifts from former lovers ; a ruby, for instance,&#xD;
which a young man, named Jan Vedder, gave her&#xD;
when she was only sixteen, of fire and hue like the&#xD;
great talisman worn by the Moorish Sorceress of 'the&#xD;
Alhambra; a string-of rare pearls, won by strategy&#xD;
from Aunt Isadore, of much value ; a set. of tur-&#xD;
quoises, the gift of a fond old 'fellow who had wished&#xD;
to have her for his wife; opals from Zambrano.&#xD;

&#xD;
These were only a few of the costly things she had&#xD;
hoarded. She kept them secret-kept then, as a re-&#xD;
source; something to fall back upon.  The casket&#xD;
was gone. It was only a plain, wooden box, brass-&#xD;
bound, very strong, and triple locked ;- nothing&#xD;
about the exterior to attract cupidity. She flew to&#xD;
her trunks, searched them hastily : no vestige of it.&#xD;
Also the India cashmeres she had wound about her&#xD;
mummy were missing. The banker's valise, over-&#xD;
coat, and the like, were not to be seen. She palpi-&#xD;
tated as she became certain that he had gotten pos-&#xD;
session-; but it might be the spoil of some other thief,&#xD;
and, she ran hurriedly down to the office to seek in-&#xD;
formation.&#xD;
"A square box, with brass corners ! yes, ma'am,&#xD;
Mr. Nickson took it in his hand when he left here an&#xD;
hour ago. I saw it when he was buying his Chicago&#xD;
tickets. It's all safe, ma'am ; but I wouldn't trust&#xD;
much things of value in your room ; better get them&#xD;
locked up in the Herrick."&#xD;
Belle stooped down to search for something on the&#xD;
floor. She desired to hide her white face and to veil&#xD;
her eyes from the observation of the smiling clerk.&#xD;
She felt what a raging devil there was glaring through&#xD;
her wondrous beauty, and phe wheeled about without&#xD;
lifting her head, and with a well-managed "thank&#xD;
you, sir."&#xD;
She passed a horrible night ; cruelty, hatred, re-&#xD;
venge struggled for mastery of her. The very spirit&#xD;
of evil raged within her soul, ansl so profaned its&#xD;
&#xD;
wonderful temple, that, sitting with clasped hands&#xD;
and staring, wicked eyes, she looked capable of fiend-&#xD;
ish deeds. The gray light of morning found her&#xD;
where she had thrown herself upon entering her apart-&#xD;
ment, and she rose and took a look at her face, and&#xD;
was ashamed that she had so allowed passion to get&#xD;
empire over her as to forget her best power, and&#xD;
bathing her eyes, and schooling her muscles to at-&#xD;
tractive graces, she swallowed an opiate (she kept&#xD;
them always by her latterly), and slept. At the'ap-&#xD;
pointed hour she descended to meet her new adviser,&#xD;
quite collected, and mistress of herself. She examined&#xD;
the livid finger-marks upon her cheek, glad to find&#xD;
them even more distinct than the evening before.&#xD;
She meant to make them her evidence in the tale she&#xD;
was about to tell.&#xD;
Mr. Clayton was impatiently awaiting her ; and you&#xD;
may believe she went through her part charmingly.&#xD;
"Married ? oh yes ; alack for pity ! to a wretch ;&#xD;
look at the marks of his cruelty. I refused to sing&#xD;
for his drunken friends ; that earned me this painful&#xD;
blow ; not the first, either. Ah ! it is'terrible beyond&#xD;
belief. Only a few weeks a wife, and' all my hopes&#xD;
cast down, dragged in the dirt, my life wrecked ! "&#xD;
After a silence, during which the handsome plotter&#xD;
bent her regal head and dropped quiet tears which&#xD;
fell like pearls, Mr. Clayton ventured to propound&#xD;
.an inquiry, quite delicately, as it might sound like a&#xD;
reflection upon the taste and judgment of the be-&#xD;
witching sufferer:&#xD;

&#xD;
How could you make such a choice ?"&#xD;
Ah, indeed! how could I; but I was alone in&#xD;
the world, Mr. Clayton. He seemed so honest and of&#xD;
such good, kind heart, and to love me so very dearly.&#xD;
The. coarseness I tried to forget'; my friends urged.&#xD;
me ; I was weary of being dependent. It is a hard&#xD;
life, sir; he promised so fairly-a-I feel now how&#xD;
wicked I have been, for i did--not-love him."&#xD;
The last words were an almost inaudible murmur, and&#xD;
the modest embarrassment of the speaker was like&#xD;
the shrinking, sensitive plant. With such texts she&#xD;
amplified' dexterously, and before the close of the&#xD;
conference she had elaborated her plan. Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton had promised to take rooms at the Folly for hir&#xD;
self and daughter.&#xD;
It is a great place ; quite too lare for my simple&#xD;
habits. I shall be so lonely there. I must have my&#xD;
sweet Kitty to bear me company ; and I know dearly&#xD;
well how joyfully she will receive the summons to&#xD;
come to me-she loves me more than I deserve."&#xD;
Mr. Clayton could not see how that could well be,&#xD;
and expressed as much in his looks and words.&#xD;
She was going home in a few days, and Mr. Clay-&#xD;
tQn would wait and accompany her ; he would not&#xD;
communicate with his daughter, but give her the full&#xD;
benefit of the double surprise.&#xD;
There were few hours of the intervening time which&#xD;
were not passed in the company of the Married&#xD;
Belle, insomuch that the lookers-on sneered, and said,&#xD;
"the young lover had gotten an old successors" de-&#xD;
&#xD;
lightfully passed in varied occupation-music, chess,&#xD;
driving, conversation. The beauty was equally sat-&#xD;
isfactory everywhere, and understood quite well how&#xD;
to avoid monotony in her entertainments. Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton could not have told whether the idea of a divorce&#xD;
originated with this "splendid creature tied to 'a&#xD;
brute," or was the offshoot of his own desires; but&#xD;
it is certain such an idea had not only presented it-&#xD;
self to him,, but had been talked over between the&#xD;
two, gradually, of course, before they left the Man-&#xD;
sion House. People thrown together in the Bohe-&#xD;
mian life of a great hotel, cut off from home influences&#xD;
and home restraints, make- intimacies. with intense&#xD;
rapidity ; and Mr. Clayton and- Mrs. Nickson were&#xD;
excellent friends before setting out for Merry Bank.&#xD;
Mr. Clayton had also gotten a good many new&#xD;
opinions concerning boarding-schools ; their perni-&#xD;
cious training ; their promotion of selfishness, vanity,&#xD;
deceit, and headstrong will; so that without any&#xD;
actual allusion to Kitty, he felt as if her education&#xD;
might have been.a failure, and her unpruned charac-&#xD;
ter overgrown with divers faults. ''Sweet Kitty got&#xD;
in such a pet !" " Mignonne flew into a 'terrible&#xD;
rage." "Cherie really made me scold her, she was&#xD;
so obstinate." These and the like were bits of infor-&#xD;
mation she industriously compiled, and artlessly in-&#xD;
termingled with her amusing recitals of their Red&#xD;
Cottage life ; we also came in for our share. "I&#xD;
actually felt obliged to remonstrate with Carlotta, she&#xD;
was so injudicious--.flattery is not good for children.&#xD;

&#xD;
LORD FEIGNING'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
If I had daughters, Mr. Clayton, they should be re.&#xD;
spectful and obedient. Mr.-Gorton encourages the&#xD;
dear girl to be such a sad romp ; you've no idea of&#xD;
the queer things they permit her to do. It may be&#xD;
all right, but I was brought up with such very pecu-&#xD;
liar ideas of refinement and maidenly, delicacy. I&#xD;
dare say I am foolishly afraid of boisterous hoydens."&#xD;
The gentleman frowned much during these naive&#xD;
,revelations, and felt that his daughter must be taken&#xD;
in hand-must be put under proper influence, and-.&#xD;
"Ah ! Mrs. Nickson is so perfect a character-if she&#xD;
should obtain a divorce-she certainly is eminently&#xD;
calculated to make a man happy." It was'so many&#xD;
years since this widower had come wit in the sphere&#xD;
of woman's influence-since he had bestowed a&#xD;
thought upon any possibility of a domestic life for&#xD;
himself-that once the idea found lodgment in his&#xD;
mind, it persisted in stopping there, despite all pro-&#xD;
priety-fighting, and while he felt too much respect for&#xD;
the handsome martyr to hint at such a consummation,&#xD;
he pondered it in secret, and fed it by constant ob-&#xD;
servation of her multiform graces and attractions.&#xD;
On the last morning she came to him in a becom-&#xD;
ing travelling dress, and looking resplendently lovely,&#xD;
but extremely shamefaced and disheartened.&#xD;
"Mr. Clayton, how shall I tell you ? "' said she,&#xD;
stepping so close to him that he caught the he-&#xD;
liotrope odor from her floating curls.&#xD;
" What is it, my dear Belle ? "-she begged him to&#xD;
call her "Belle," saying, " the name she was forced to&#xD;
&#xD;
bear was so, utterlyodious to her," as well it might&#xD;
be.&#xD;
"This absurd hotel-keeper ! I don't know how to&#xD;
find words, it is so dreadful-such a shameful indig-&#xD;
nity ! "&#xD;
it took a little pressing to bring out the truth,&#xD;
which came at last in the sweetest of low voices, and&#xD;
amidst the most charming blushes. " My trunks-&#xD;
all detained ! the bills not paid. Oh, dear ! what a&#xD;
fate is mine ! "&#xD;
" Give yourself no uneasiness,. my dearest Belle ;&#xD;
don't think of it for a moment ! I will attend to the&#xD;
matter. I heartily trust the time approaches when&#xD;
you will have suffered the last of these unpleasant ex-&#xD;
periences-when you will be free from this monster&#xD;
who is so reckless of your happiness, so unworthy of&#xD;
the infinite treasure he has gained. You have my&#xD;
warmest sympathy ; trust the whole to me."&#xD;
"Sympathy is akin to pity, pity akin to love,"&#xD;
thought Belle, as she lifted her eyes, swimming in&#xD;
grateful gushingness. (" Deai-, what a pity he is so&#xD;
very sallow, and so bald ! ") " Ah," said she, "how&#xD;
can I thank you enough ? You cannot know how in-&#xD;
expressibly sweet it is to me, so long shut up in myself,&#xD;
to find a safe friend upon whom I may lean for com-&#xD;
fort. My dreadful husband has money enough, and,&#xD;
of course, he will make it right on his return ; but how&#xD;
unfeeling to desert me in such a manner ! Ah ! if he&#xD;
would but stay out of my sight till I could be free&#xD;
from his insults,. safe from his brutality. Words&#xD;

She shuddered and shivered and looked so utterly&#xD;
heart-broken, that Mr. Clayton made haste to take&#xD;
her hands in his and to squeeze them a little, while&#xD;
he spoke such words of consolation as suggested&#xD;
themselves ; and he had the greatest mind in the&#xD;
world to kiss off a tear which filtered through her&#xD;
dropped eyelid; and after just .touching her cheek,&#xD;
the hue of a blush rose, dropped, a round pearl,&#xD;
upon his hand. Fortunately, he was so much out of&#xD;
practice that it took some courage for violent love-&#xD;
making, and he hastened away to assume the neces-&#xD;
sary preliminaries for their departure.&#xD;

HE summer was all gone long ago ; June had&#xD;
scattered her roses; August had left the&#xD;
sweetness of her perfumed breath upon the&#xD;
ripe hay, before she gathered up her gossamer robes&#xD;
for departure. The woods were gay with their red&#xD;
and golden leaves; and the acorns lay piled beneath&#xD;
the great oaks, and the chestnut burrs were open, and&#xD;
lying hid away among the shining brown foliage,&#xD;
waiting till the boys'and girls should, hunt them out,&#xD;
with many a shout, with frisky springing and jocund&#xD;
singing.&#xD;
Henry, accompanied by Pitkin Sterling, drove a&#xD;
livery span up to the door of the Red Cottage, and&#xD;
politely invited us to come out nutting. Of course,&#xD;
we dropped .all our occupations in a hurry, though&#xD;
we were deep in the mysteries of cider-apple sauce.&#xD;

&#xD;
Carlotta swung off the crane from whence depended&#xD;
the four-pailed brass kettlein which the sweet juice&#xD;
was bubbling and steaming, and bade Winnie "watch&#xD;
it for her life during her absence."  Kitty set down&#xD;
the basket of "pumpkin-honeys " she was coreing,&#xD;
and vanished upstairs ; and almost before we knew&#xD;
where she had flown, she came dancing down, ar-&#xD;
rayed in a spick and span fresh dress, and stood in&#xD;
the open doorway, taking leave of Jim, and drawing on&#xD;
her little gloves, and ready for a start. With sundry&#xD;
last charges and warnings to our faithful old factotum,&#xD;
Carlotta and I came forth ; and we all piled into the&#xD;
four-wheeled vehicle called a Landau, and bowled&#xD;
merrily along the plank-road with spirits ready for&#xD;
any adventure. It was one of those perfect Fall&#xD;
days when earth and sky look their best, and&#xD;
the air is deliciously cool and invigorating. We&#xD;
turned off into the sweet-smelling woods, where the&#xD;
slender brakes gave out grateful odors with every&#xD;
pressing footstep ; where the woodchucks peeped at&#xD;
us from their holes, and the gray squirrels basked&#xD;
among the high branches, and the carrion-crows&#xD;
wheeled and cawed over our heads. We filled the&#xD;
moments with jest and song, and our baskets with&#xD;
glossy stores, and forgot our years and dignities, and&#xD;
made children of ourselves just for a little while.&#xD;
There came near being a fuss, though, because&#xD;
Mr. Sterling thought proper to ask Carlotta if she&#xD;
had read "John Halifax," and after getting an affirma-&#xD;
tive, he extended his inquiry upon very dangerous&#xD;
&#xD;
ground-asking if she thought she could make such&#xD;
a wife as Ursula, adding, "She is my idea of a life-&#xD;
mate.                            o&#xD;
They were sitting apart, eating amicably out of&#xD;
the same basket. I knew .directly that something&#xD;
had gone amiss, because Carlotta jumped up so sharp&#xD;
as to overset the receptacle, and send the contents&#xD;
spinning.&#xD;
"A  stupid, unreasoning nobody-look how she&#xD;
treated that poor girl ! no, I flatter myself I never-&#xD;
could ! I should be sorry to think I could let a day&#xD;
pass without saying or. doing something sensible ;&#xD;
and as for John Halifax, I consider. him a priggish,&#xD;
obstinate mule !~- If you are building such a couple-&#xD;
ship with me in it, you may pull it to pieces at your&#xD;
leisure. I'll none. of it ! Once for all, I'm not going&#xD;
to make such a wife as anybody ! I don't want such&#xD;
a husband as anybody! If you can't leave off study-&#xD;
ing models, comparing and measuring, you'd better&#xD;
go back to China."&#xD;
"Yes, ny dear Carlotta, I'intend to return to the&#xD;
Celestial Empire when the necessary preliminaries&#xD;
are adjusted-such as a wedding-ring, trousseau, etc.&#xD;
I think it will make a unique bridal-trip, just enough&#xD;
out of the common to suit my very rarely endowed&#xD;
bride. Then you think you can't make an Ursula ? "&#xD;
" Can't ! I didn't say that-I could do anything I&#xD;
liked-I won't !&#xD;
"Very well, I won't urge you-Carlotta suits me&#xD;
tolerably--only don't spap my" head off. -On the&#xD;

whole, I don't believe I shouldn't like Ursula for a&#xD;
wife."&#xD;
Seeing that we were all laughing at her, the lady&#xD;
flounced down and ,began gathering together the&#xD;
scattered spoil. They made it up somehow after&#xD;
we. left them, because they were excellent friends,&#xD;
and Carlotta as sweet as a rose the rest of the day.&#xD;
I never saw Kitty Clayton look prettier. A sort&#xD;
of cloud had been hanging over the dear child. The&#xD;
lover she had gotten was' a care and an anxiety to&#xD;
her. Her firm trust in him was not precisely shaken,&#xD;
but there was something she could not understand.&#xD;
In all the weeks which had elapsed she had received&#xD;
but a couple of letters: the first full of merry&#xD;
plans for their future, of success against the Brazen&#xD;
Gates, whimsical lamentations because his hair would&#xD;
not curd, and of fond praises of Lady Delight. She&#xD;
put it away with the sprig of jessamine and a wild&#xD;
columbine he had given her that happy evening be-&#xD;
neath the yellow harvest moon, when she had prom-&#xD;
ised to be his-wife. The .next, short, speaking only&#xD;
of business, constant occupation, etc. We never&#xD;
mentioned the subject to her ; with all her simplicity&#xD;
there was a certain reticence about her which hedged&#xD;
securely her secret emotions. -When ,Aunt Elinor&#xD;
scolded and threatened, she only said: "Now, don't,&#xD;
auntie ; I will not be a bugbear ; he shall do as he&#xD;
likes: If he has changed his mind, he shall not be&#xD;
hauled up and pounced upon. I am only a simple,&#xD;
little, childish thing, not half fit for a wife. If he has&#xD;
&#xD;
OUR NUTTING PARTY.            305 .&#xD;
found it out, and regrets what he has done, let it&#xD;
pass ; you shan't frown at me, auntie ; you shall not&#xD;
persecute him-I won't have him scolded. It was a&#xD;
cunning little dream; I enjoyed it, and if I have to&#xD;
wake up out of it, all you could do or say wouldn't&#xD;
help me any.".&#xD;
It was after such a conversation that Miss Walsing-&#xD;
ham privately enclosed and dispatched the ivory-&#xD;
type ; and she had felt ever since as if she had done&#xD;
the girl an injury; though she sternly said, " If&#xD;
there is.anything amiss; and that face does not set- it&#xD;
right, I shall be disappointed in my boy, and what's&#xD;
more, I'll stay disappointed the rest of my life."&#xD;
To-day the exhilarating air, the merry party, and&#xD;
the wild-wood frolic, which Kitty dearly loved, in-&#xD;
spired her. Doubts and fears fled away-like mists&#xD;
before sunbeams, and her glad life and cheerfulness&#xD;
made us very happy.&#xD;
On- our return home we'stopped at the 1Merry&#xD;
Bank post-office for the family mail, and Henry ran&#xD;
in for it, while Kitty made great show of holding in&#xD;
-the ferocious beasts of livery hacks during his ab-&#xD;
sence. He tarried three or four minutes, and when&#xD;
he came out he took the reins from the laughing&#xD;
girl without speaking to or looking at her. The re-&#xD;
mainder of the distance he seemed absorbed in&#xD;
painful thought, making no reply to his favorite's&#xD;
sprightly nonsense, except a pitying glance at her&#xD;
sometimes.. When we reached, she sprang lightly&#xD;
to the ground.&#xD;

"I declare! there is that tiresome old gobbler on&#xD;
the gully fence, waiting for me to chase him home,&#xD;
I suppose ; well, I'll soon realize his expectations, I&#xD;
will chase him!" She started off with springing step.&#xD;
" Oh, Kitty! here's a letter for you !" (poor dear!)&#xD;
Henry added, under his breath.&#xD;
He had received one by the same mail from his old&#xD;
college chum, Bradbury (in fact, it was through our&#xD;
lawyer that Archie Laurie had obtained his excellent&#xD;
position), of the firm of Bradbury &amp;amp; Laurie, making.-&#xD;
pretty full mention of his junior's late escapade, and&#xD;
his present absence amongst the lumbermen.&#xD;
Kitty wheeled swiftly about. The wild wind&#xD;
sported with her curls, blowing them all over her rosy&#xD;
cheeks, and her eyes danced through their meshes with&#xD;
innocent glee. She caught sight of Henry's half-&#xD;
averted face, and her own dropped directly 'and the&#xD;
red color faded out of her face, the gay sparkle from&#xD;
her glance.&#xD;
"You have bad news there," said she ; " my father&#xD;
is ill."&#xD;
"It is not from New Orleans," replied Henry, busy-&#xD;
ing his hands with the harness. She tore it open,&#xD;
standing there in the clear .sunset, and hurriedly read&#xD;
it. Mr. Sterling walked away, not wishing to be a&#xD;
witness of what he foresaw would be unpleasant. She&#xD;
made no moan, but turning to Carlotta, she buried&#xD;
her pitiful face in her bosom, and clasping close the&#xD;
woman-friend, she hushed her grief and sorrow, silent-&#xD;
ly struggling.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Come. away, pet, to my room; let's talk," whis-&#xD;
pered Carlotta.&#xD;
She complied without a word ; and thrust the letter&#xD;
into the hand which sought hers. "I wish I could&#xD;
take a little cry," said she ; " I feel so choked, so hurt;&#xD;
so ashamed.&#xD;
The tears did come at last ; great bursts of sobbing&#xD;
swept over her slight frame, leaving her quivering and&#xD;
exhausted. Carlotta held her quietly, not knowing&#xD;
what to say to her ; she had not calculated on the cap-&#xD;
acity for suffering in this delicately strung nature ; and&#xD;
she was forced to look on, nearly powerless to offer&#xD;
aid in this, her first trouble. Words would not touch&#xD;
it, and endurance in a solitary state, which knows no&#xD;
neighbors.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;

T was the. time in the' waning day ere the&#xD;
evening lamps are lighted, etc. We all sat to-&#xD;
gether before the sociable wood-fire, which&#xD;
chippered softly among its ruddy blazes, each one si-&#xD;
lent and thoughtful...&#xD;
Kitty sat on a low stool ; her scarlet wools and-her&#xD;
crochet pins lay unused in her lap, and she was leaning&#xD;
her head, like a weary child, against Carlotta's knee,&#xD;
her idle fingers interlocked and pressed together, and&#xD;
her mournful eyes gazing into the changing' coals.&#xD;
Archie's letter was a manly one ; he had not spared&#xD;
himself in the least, but there was.a little hitch. In&#xD;
his self-blame he had confined his epistle to statements&#xD;
of facts, and left them naked and uripalliated: not&#xD;
asking to be forgiven, or speaking of the future, and&#xD;
Kitt felt sure, and the more she pondered it, surer,&#xD;
&#xD;
GHOSTS ON ROLLERS            309&#xD;
that Belle Brandon was still in his thoughts, or that&#xD;
her simple self was too simple and childish and insuf-&#xD;
ficient to  fill avoid left by such gorgeousness, variety,&#xD;
and diverse attractions-it is -a 'ty sometimes that&#xD;
souls cannot communicate with t poor words ; it&#xD;
would save so many heart-aches and misunderstand-&#xD;
ings-while Archie, proudly leaving everything to her,&#xD;
not asking even for a reply to his letter, was waiting&#xD;
to hear her verdict, she, brooding over probabilities&#xD;
and undervaluing her own powers, had no intention&#xD;
to shorten the distance she imagined he had placed&#xD;
between them, and was silently striving to forget him&#xD;
and leave him out of her life. It seemed as if she had&#xD;
suffered enough, but there was more to come-the&#xD;
bitterness of unfeeling tongues, which wound like&#xD;
daggers. Merry Bank is a little village, and the ris-&#xD;
ing up and sitting of its inhabitants are well known&#xD;
to each other ; and what is not fully known is guessed&#xD;
out, and everything is commented upon by everybody,&#xD;
and the town is quite likely to side off into violent&#xD;
partisanship, over very immaterial occurrences, and&#xD;
hard words are bandied and sharp sayings fired off by&#xD;
picked combatants, who become personally aggrieved&#xD;
and often bitter enemies, on- account of events which&#xD;
concerned them not in the remotest degree.&#xD;
My eyes were fixed upon Kitty; and my thoughts&#xD;
busy about her. I could not help a sigh as I studied&#xD;
her drooping little figure, so buoyantly able to express&#xD;
light-heartedness-the flickering fire-shine playing&#xD;
over her patient face, so gentle sweet in its sadness.&#xD;

Mrs. Squirmwell had been to see. Kitty, and told her&#xD;
"at to mind what folks said, for Mr. Squirmwell&#xD;
thought everything of her ; and to come into her&#xD;
Sunday-school class, and that there was as go  fish&#xD;
in the sea as ever was caught out, and that fames&#xD;
Peacock thought she had beautiful eyes ; and to pick&#xD;
up another feller," and had gone home, feeling highly&#xD;
puffed up by the tone and spirit of her consolations,&#xD;
and left our poor child, who had been quite speech-&#xD;
less, while the visitor held her hand. in her damp,&#xD;
clammy one, and entirely powerless-to resist the fare-&#xD;
well kiss she had got from the rather moist lips of the&#xD;
singing woman; humbled in the dust, and ashamed to&#xD;
look in our faces, or let us look in hers.&#xD;
Miss Walsingham had ,come down and carried her,&#xD;
off almost by force, to spend a day. She.shrank es-&#xD;
pecially from this full-voiced, hearty woman, who had&#xD;
lived down and conquered her own small foibles;&#xD;
who knew all about her lover, and her happiness,&#xD;
and who-would wound her by scolding and calling&#xD;
him hard names. She had shown his last letter to his&#xD;
aunt, who would not be denied, but she did it under&#xD;
protest ; and she also hung on her neck, refusing to&#xD;
let her go except she promised not to interfere by&#xD;
word or deed.&#xD;
" If Archie wishes to make up, he will come and&#xD;
say so ; if he doesn't, he will stay away. I never&#xD;
will take one step towards him. I am not like Belle&#xD;
Brandon to run after people, and I shall let him un-&#xD;
derstand it."&#xD;
&#xD;
"But, my child, you ought to write to him ; you&#xD;
owe him an answer to his letter ; it is- your plain&#xD;
duty."&#xD;
" No, auntie; he did not ask me ; he treats our&#xD;
engagement as a thing of the past, and it is, I think.&#xD;
I shall die Kitty Clayton. I have had my wish ; I&#xD;
got a lover and I lost him ; and there is the end of&#xD;
the whole."&#xD;
And Kitty returned in the evening to us, very&#xD;
weary, and glad to be left alone with her sorrow,&#xD;
among friends who let her work out her life without&#xD;
any obtrusive thrusts of advice.&#xD;
As I was saying, while we sat around our fire, the&#xD;
house-door opened without any warning, and like a&#xD;
ghost on rollers came Mrs. Ramble among us.&#xD;
"Why, laws-a-me!" she exclaimed, untying her&#xD;
bonnet, and letting up the horse-hair everlastings from&#xD;
among her grizzled frizzles as she pushed back the&#xD;
head-gear. "Laws-a-me ! how dreadful pleasant it&#xD;
does look here ! I can't stay a second hardly; I just&#xD;
run in. I always tell our folks there ain't nothing so&#xD;
cheersome as a good bright fire-place, and Carlotta&#xD;
keeps her hand irons so proper clean too ; mine won't&#xD;

salt and vinegar, but they will turn kinder grim and,&#xD;

curus things. I tell Ramble 'tain't so much conse-&#xD;
quence about critter-comforts, so long as there's a&#xD;
fire kindled on the altar."&#xD;
By the time she had got thus far she was comfort-&#xD;
ably seated in-the big rocking-chaii, which Jim 'most&#xD;
unwillingly vacated for her occupancy, spitting and&#xD;
growling most inhospitably as she pushed him out,&#xD;
and vindict'vely eying her afterwards. Having taken&#xD;
out the ble sock, and  adjusted' her needle in its&#xD;
goose- uill sheath, she clicked along with her knitting'&#xD;
and her remarks, while her sharp eyes sought out and&#xD;
peered into everything around her.&#xD;
"I had quite an accident this morning. You see&#xD;
Ramble got kinder belated, and the fire wouldn't go&#xD;
very brisk, and I hauled out a handful of straw out of&#xD;
the bed to'kindle with, and as true as you live, I burnt&#xD;
up Ramble's silver watch that his pa give him when&#xD;
he died. I didn't find it out till I took up the ashes,&#xD;
and there it was, sure enough,, asblack as the chimbly._&#xD;
I don't know what he'll say; I don't care no great;&#xD;

Henry began Ioudly to hum " Win'dham," suddenly&#xD;
breaking out, as if his feelings were too many for him;&#xD;

"I dunno as you've heard the news ! That Belle&#xD;

city, goin' round the stores, dressed to fits, and buy-&#xD;

was such a friend of yourn, and .it was through you&#xD;
that she' got her rich husband and all ; and Iknew&#xD;
you'd like to hear what a fool she's makin' of herself,&#xD;

he struck her so as she carried the marks on her&#xD;
cheek for a week ; and Archic, he went away ; some&#xD;
says he had'to leave 'twixt two days ; I don't know&#xD;
nothin' about that ; 'tenrate, 'twas ridiculous ; he&#xD;
hadn't no business foolin' after that stuck-up peacock,&#xD;

wife-not a mite ! "&#xD;
Kitty tightened her clasp upon Carlotta's fingers,&#xD;
and her frame quivered, but she never moved nor&#xD;
took her eyes from the changing coals. The old&#xD;
knocker gave out a sharp rat-a-tat, and.Winnie, in a&#xD;
fierce condition of tucked-up gown, ushered, in Belle&#xD;
Nickson and Mr. Clayton-the lady all gushingness,&#xD;
smiles, and beauty, and the gentleman following in&#xD;
her wake, perfectly satisfied with her companionship,&#xD;
and  quite alive to the new class of emotions she in-&#xD;
spired in his breast.  She floated up to Carlotta&#xD;
and seized bothher hands, but she did not keep them&#xD;
long; and thence to Henry, who rose up aghast to&#xD;
receive her compliments ; then she seized upon Kitty,&#xD;
who had sprung to her feet and stood pale and&#xD;
trembling, looking from the gentleman to the lady&#xD;
in fear and amazement..&#xD;
Her own papa.! and in such company!,- on such&#xD;
friendly terms !&#xD;
My sweet Mignonne, here we are ! Now you owe&#xD;
me a thousand kisses; look what I have brought you:&#xD;
&#xD;
GHOSTS ON ROLLERS.&#xD;
And you are to come right away with us to my home,&#xD;
where you are to stay, oh ! forever, I hope. Is she&#xD;
not, Mr. Clayton ? " Then pretending to observe in&#xD;
wonder, Kitty's embarrassment, she gave her a little&#xD;
push: "Why, Cherie, you ungrateful child, what's&#xD;
the matter-are you not glad to see your papa?"&#xD;
"Yes," stammered Kitty, feeling that her father&#xD;
was sternly, critically regarding her. "How do you&#xD;
do, papa?" said she faintly, sidling toward him and&#xD;
scarcely daring to look up. -Belle burst into a laugh&#xD;
musical-and unpleasant.&#xD;
" What a funny little midge it is! 'how do you do,&#xD;
papa?"' mimicking her tone and manner. "Why don't&#xD;
you rush into his arms, hug him ! kiss him !" She&#xD;
folded her own rapturously-and suggestively. "Here&#xD;
he has come all these weary miles to see you ; I have&#xD;
been impatient to arrive that I might witness your&#xD;
joy; and all you have for him is a cold 'how do you&#xD;
do, papa?'"&#xD;
With his daughter's shrinking manner thus dis-&#xD;
agreeably thrust upon his notice, Mr. Clayton looked&#xD;
stern and forbidding, and felt thathe was being very&#xD;
ill-treated by an ungrateful child -; and after a chilly&#xD;
kiss upon her cheek, he put the poor thing from him&#xD;
and turned toward us, explaining his route, and&#xD;
talking generalities without bestowing any further&#xD;
attention upon her. An inexpressible constraint&#xD;
shadowed all our attempts at cordiality ; and with&#xD;
Belle in front of her, Carlotta got crisper every&#xD;
moment, and said such sharp things that I felt sure&#xD;

Mr. Clayton must regard her as a shrew and a vixen,&#xD;
and I--attempted to rally, and be cheerful and polite;&#xD;
and then Belle came and whispered in my ear,&#xD;
"That's right, Serena ; a great catch ; first impressions,&#xD;
you know-I'll help you," which of course effectually&#xD;
quenched me; and added to her joyousness. In fact,&#xD;
she was perfectly radiant, and talked and laughed,&#xD;
and appeared to Mr. Clayton in a state of rich ex-&#xD;
pansiveness and beaming beauty, unparalleled in his&#xD;
previous experience.&#xD;
"Come, Cherie," said she, rising at length, "get&#xD;
your hat, please : we must go home."&#xD;
Kitty drew back and looked imploringly at Car-&#xD;
lotta. Mr. Clayton also rose and fixed his eyes&#xD;
upon his daughter, disapproving of her 'utterly.&#xD;
"What have you been doing to Cherie ?" asked&#xD;
Belle merrily. "She is as vite as a primrose; why&#xD;
will you not let me touch your hand, child? I am not&#xD;
a basilisk that I should blight you. Look, Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton, doesn't she appear as if we were hailing her to&#xD;
prison and the judgment ?"&#xD;
"Do you wish Kitty to accompany you this even-&#xD;
ing?" asked Henry soberly; "it seems rather sudden,&#xD;
and is also a trifle late,"&#xD;
"I have taken rooms in Mrs. Nickson's house, by&#xD;
a great kindness of hers, during my stay in town,-and-&#xD;
of course I expected Miss Clayton to occupy them,&#xD;
but after some trouble and inconvenience to myself,&#xD;
I perceive I am not very welcome, and certainly shall&#xD;
not insist upon her sharing my quarters."&#xD;
&#xD;
GHOSTS ON ROLLERS.&#xD;
" Oh yes, papa," stammered Kitty ; "I am coming&#xD;
with you, but I was so surprised."&#xD;
"And so delighted," laughed Belle.&#xD;
"Mr. Clayton," said Carlotta, turning her back&#xD;
upon the blonde, whose eyes got the color of tempered&#xD;
steel, "I wish you would consent to leave Kitty with&#xD;
us; she is not well, she is at home here, we love her,&#xD;
and cannot bear to part with her."&#xD;
"I shall not compel her to accompany me," an-&#xD;
swered Mr. Clayton, stiffly.&#xD;
" Where's your husband now, Belle ? " spoke up&#xD;
Mrs. Ramble, who had kept unusually silent thus far,&#xD;
watching all parties, and congratulating herself upon&#xD;
her good luck in happening round just in the nick of&#xD;
time. " Gone horse-racing ? Law me ! you kinder&#xD;
ignore him so, folks forget you've got one.; you must&#xD;
forget it yourself sometimes,^don't you ? We heard&#xD;
all how you tied him up to the bedstead. I said&#xD;
it served him right, if he couldn't take a joke. You&#xD;
train him, I'll be bound. He'll find out the differ-&#xD;
ence between wine -and winegar afore he dies."&#xD;
" Kitty," said Belle, hurriedly turning her back&#xD;
upon her ancient enemy, and, as it were, wiping her&#xD;
out of the group; " Kitty, Cherie, I really must hurry&#xD;
you; I am a housekeeper now. I have a couple of&#xD;
new servants up at the Folly, awaiting my orders ;&#xD;
we must hasten home and tell them about breakfast.&#xD;
What shall we have? . Waffles ! I see it in your eyes.&#xD;
I know what Cherie loves: peaches and cream, and&#xD;
omelette. Won't it be fun to have what we like?&#xD;

&#xD;
We must beg Carlotta to teach us housekeeping. I&#xD;
invite you Red Cottageites, every one, to dine and&#xD;
sup off our good things."&#xD;
Kitty listened-to her pleasant words dropping like&#xD;
honey, and looked at her father-who stood apart,&#xD;
in an- offended attitude-sidled out, feeling awkward&#xD;
and embarrassed, and generally of small importance..&#xD;
I followed her, and she threw herself into my arms.&#xD;
"Why, Kitty, darling, don't take on so! " I said,;&#xD;
"you will make your papa think you are not glad to&#xD;
see .him ; and you know how often and often 'you&#xD;
liave longed for his coming. You will have beautiful&#xD;
times up there ; and you must brighten up, and you&#xD;
must show him what a sweet, dear daughter he has."'&#xD;
" I cannot act like myself with her by !'" sobbed&#xD;
she; "I wish I could stay here. I am afraid ! oh,&#xD;
dear.! what shall I do?",&#xD;
I let her cry a little, and then made her bathe her&#xD;
face. "She *will not dare to be disagreeable ; I&#xD;
don't think she will wish to," said I, trying to believe&#xD;
my own statement; "and we will run~ up often. I&#xD;
don't see any help for it. If I could find any way to&#xD;
keep you without offending your father ; but it can't&#xD;
be done.",&#xD;
Kitty hung back. "But I met Archie there. I&#xD;
had a lovely time that night ; better than I can ever&#xD;
have again ; and now it is so different. How strange&#xD;
it seems ! like an ugly dream-for my papa to walk&#xD;
in with Belle Brandon !-Why couldn't she stay&#xD;
away?. I don't want to go and live in-her house; I&#xD;
&#xD;
don't like her; I hate her! What if Archie should&#xD;
come up there ? I should die if I had to see them&#xD;
together. I wish I dared tell papa how he has be-&#xD;
haved. I can't go ; I won't go I I will stay here ;&#xD;
you'll let me, won't you ? "&#xD;
Putting her hastily from me, I ran downstairs.&#xD;
I .am a shy person-a poor talker ; but I spoke&#xD;
firmly: " Mr. Clayton," said I, " please let us 'have&#xD;
Kitty to-night ; the poor child is not well ; a night's-&#xD;
rest will refresh her and set her all right. As I have&#xD;
undertaken to be her physician I desire to keep her&#xD;
where I can see the effect of my medicines."&#xD;
"Cherie has a great deal of will," said Belle,&#xD;
shaking her head. sadly; " a great, .deal; she has&#xD;
taken an unaccountable whim about this; I can't&#xD;
understand it, but I really do not think you ought to&#xD;
encourage her."&#xD;
"She - has not a stubborn will," said, Carlotta ;&#xD;
"she is only too heavenly, kind, and patient, and&#xD;
gentle. Come, be careful, now, Madame Belle ! I&#xD;
am reasonably forbearing, but I will say something&#xD;
if you provoke me."&#xD;
Belle laughed innocently. " Oh, no doubt of that,&#xD;
Carlotta ; all who have been so happy as to live ,in&#xD;
the same house with you know quite well how fast.&#xD;
you can talk ; I am sure I have no objection. It&#xD;
seems-very kind of you, to wish to shelter Kitty and&#xD;
conceal her faults, but I do not think it is right; and&#xD;
I am too outspoken 'to do it. I think it is her plain&#xD;
duty to obey her father, -as it ought to be her&#xD;

pleasure, and would be under different influence..&#xD;
You see, Mr. Clayton, it is just as I toldyou."&#xD;
I saw and felt that for some reason of her own&#xD;
Belle wished to make a breach between us ; and I&#xD;
determined she should not get her will.&#xD;
"I have always given you credit for amazing&#xD;
sharpness, 'Belle," said I, pleasantly;. "and you&#xD;
must be endowed with wonderful penetration if&#xD;
you can discover any blemishes in our dear, sweet&#xD;
child; but we will take them all for granted. The&#xD;
point in debate just now : shall we be permitted to&#xD;
keep her for this night? Only say'' yes', Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton, please."&#xD;
''"Why, Serena ! how very coaxing you can be.!&#xD;
What a pity you had not begun earlier ! Say 'no,'&#xD;
sir. You must be deaf to the voiceof the charmer.&#xD;
Kitty needs a father's authority, and this is a good&#xD;
point to make. I really cannot consent to the mar-&#xD;
ring of all our beautiful plans-we'll stop on the way&#xD;
and buy baby a sugar-plum."&#xD;
Tell my daughter I desire her to descend di-&#xD;
rectly,." said Mr. Clayton, in freezing tones.&#xD;
.' Thank you, sir ; i only needs-a little firmness on&#xD;
your part, and all will e well. Carlotta, you are&#xD;
the efficiency in this ho sehold, and I leave it with&#xD;
you to see that the child's trunks are packed and dis--&#xD;
patched to the Folly early to-morrow'."&#xD;
Kitty came, pale and uncomfortable, and when the&#xD;
blonde took her father's proffered arm, she followed&#xD;
as best she might. She did not speak a word during&#xD;
&#xD;
the walk, and Mr. Clayton seemed quite engrossed&#xD;
by the sprightly nothings of the handsome plotter,&#xD;
who exerted herself to be delightful.&#xD;
"Since you are an invalid, Cherie, you had better&#xD;
retire immediately," said Belle, when they reached&#xD;
her" home. '"I hope you will rise in good trim to-&#xD;
morrow, because I shall need your assistance in ar-&#xD;
ranging our new furniture ; we must teach Cherie to&#xD;
be useful, must we not, Mr. Clayton?"&#xD;
"Certainly; I hope the life she is about to com-&#xD;
mence will develop new qualities. I am sure it must,&#xD;
under such guidance.&#xD;
"Thank you,.sir ;" I believe I have rather a special-&#xD;
ty, which, is training young maidens to industry.&#xD;
It seems a pity to be idle in a world where there is so&#xD;
much to accomplish-for me ; - I shall be only too&#xD;
glad to fill my hours."&#xD;
Kitty's room was opposite her father's, and she&#xD;
went in without a good-night kiss; Mr. Clayton felt&#xD;
very angry, considered ,her very ungrateful ; uncon-&#xD;
sciously, the leaven Belle had been so busily dropping&#xD;
into his mind was leavening the whole lump.&#xD;
Oh! what a sore heart our poor, friendless darling&#xD;
took to her couch that night ! She lay awake. long,&#xD;
trying-to make out what it all meant ; how it had&#xD;
come to pass-she in the power of the woman who&#xD;
had done her best to wreck her happiness. After&#xD;
thinking till her head ached, and praying some fervent&#xD;
prayers, she slept at length ; her last thought a resolu-&#xD;

near enough to let .him know how dearly she loved&#xD;
and wished to please him.I&#xD;
She rose betimes, dressed herself carefully,.and&#xD;
knocked at the opposite door., She knocked hur-&#xD;
riedly, and with a fluttering heart; she heard in the&#xD;
distance the clear voice of the hostess, who sang a&#xD;
morning hymn, and she almost resolved to enter un-&#xD;
bidden, so.much did she dread her coming. While&#xD;
she stood irresolutely with the knob in her fingers,&#xD;
Belle floated up to her, and Mr. Clayton came out&#xD;
just in time to surprise an affecting tableau, viz., his&#xD;
naughty child in the arms of her forgiving friend,-who&#xD;
beamed upon them both in a cherubic manner, as she&#xD;
uttered her musical good-morning. Not only was the&#xD;
opportunity lost, but Kitty felt- ashamed of her cow-&#xD;
ardice, which had not repulsed caresses she abhorred,&#xD;
and so left her in a false position even more difficult&#xD;
than ever.&#xD;
"Come, Cherie," said Belle, as they rose from the&#xD;
breakfast table, at which she had presided with grace-&#xD;
ful elegance, looking "like Mopsa, the queen of curds&#xD;
and cream," while our darling sat by, silent, con!&#xD;
strained, and uncomfortable ; the. good-morning sa-&#xD;
lute she had offered her father having been coolly re-&#xD;
"ceived, and her red eyes and unhappy face having&#xD;
been severely noted and disapproved of. "Come, I&#xD;
want you to try my new piano, and show your father&#xD;
how well you can play."&#xD;
"I cannot," faltered she; ''"you know, Belle, I&#xD;
have not the least bit of execution."'&#xD;

"Nonsense, child ! Now don't go into one of your&#xD;
perverse fits. If you do, I shall feel it my'duty to&#xD;
scold you ; just sit down and dash off something; we&#xD;
are not hard critics to willing children; are we, sir ? "&#xD;
'" Papa ! do you wish it ?" asked Kitty desper-&#xD;
ately. ''I will do anything for you that I can ; - but I&#xD;
have-no talent for music ; never could learn it."&#xD;
''I do not expect to find my daughter disobliging,"&#xD;
answered Mr. Clayton; "Ihate missiness and nonsense.&#xD;
You have been taking piano lessons-at least I have&#xD;
paid' for them, and I expect you to show some signs&#xD;
of proficiency."&#xD;
"I'l do my best, papa,". replied Kitty' humbly;&#xD;
"but my best is very poor indeed."&#xD;
She sat down, and commenced a school piece ; but&#xD;
the keys blurred beneath her swimming eyes, and her&#xD;
fingers refused to go right, and 'after half a dozen fu-&#xD;
tile attempts to rally, she burst. into tears, and laying&#xD;
her pretty head on the instrument, she cried ready to&#xD;
break her poor little heart.&#xD;
" You must not blame our dear Cherie," purred&#xD;
Belle apologetically; "she has been so petted and&#xD;
'spoiled, any crossing of her .whims or rigorous re-&#xD;
straints are extremely disagreeable to her. She will&#xD;
soon rise above all such childishness, under your firm,&#xD;
judicious hand. Don't you feel like trying again,&#xD;
Mignonne? it is a pity to leave such an impression&#xD;
upon your good father; he will excuse you if you&#xD;
really make an effort. Play that little polka Archie&#xD;

Goaded to desperation, Kitty sprang to her feet:&#xD;
"Don't you dare to mention that name to me, you&#xD;
wicked woman-you wretch-you fiend ! Oh, papa,&#xD;
you do not know how cruel she is to me. Don't let&#xD;
her plague me--so; do pity me."&#xD;
"Go to your room," replied her father. "I am&#xD;
displeased, disappointed, disgusted. Such offensive,&#xD;
unladylike behavior, such coarse epithets ; ungrateful,&#xD;
too, to a lady who kindly endeavors to assist you to&#xD;
appear at your best ; selfish in your stubborn refusal&#xD;
to comply with my wishes. Go to your room."&#xD;
" Do not be hard upon Cherie. I assure you, I&#xD;
long ago ceased to mind her little tempers ; you see&#xD;
they do not move me, answered the blonde, in a&#xD;
beautiful gushing attitude ; "forgive her this once as&#xD;
I do, freely ; I will answefor her in future."&#xD;
She went up to Kitty and attempted to pass an&#xD;
arm around her waist, but the child shrank from her.&#xD;
approach as from a deadly reptile ; she tried hard to&#xD;
control her emotions and realize her position.&#xD;
"Papa, papa ! " she cried, "will you not listen to&#xD;
me ! I am not bad, I am not wilful, nor disobedient.&#xD;
I love you dearly, only let me tell you the truth; let&#xD;
me speak to you, when her dreadful eyes.are noton&#xD;
me. Ah, papa, you do not know Belle Brandon;&#xD;
dearest papa, don't frown ! don't turn away! __I am&#xD;
your child, your little Kitty ; oh, ask Carlotta if I am&#xD;
bad. Oh ! do not kill me with such looks ; oh ! my&#xD;
heart will break !"&#xD;
Mr. Clayton's eyes were fixed upon the face of&#xD;
&#xD;
the blonde, who used all her baleful power to enchant&#xD;
them, and he saw his daughter through the glamour&#xD;
she threw about her. He had been ,well: prepared&#xD;
for any delinquencies on the part of the child, and&#xD;
the words he used were somehow inspired in his&#xD;
mind by her arch cunning, somehow given him to&#xD;
speak ; and when she lowered her superb head, and&#xD;
dropped her creamy countenance into her mouchoir,&#xD;
sending him a waft of heliotrope and. a martyr-&#xD;
glance, he sternly commanded Kitty to leave him,&#xD;
adding, " Stay till I recall you; I must put an end-to&#xD;
this sort of thing ; I hope it is not too late."&#xD;
"Do not be harsh, sir," murmured the belle, as&#xD;
Kitty left them: "Cherie will think so hardly of poor&#xD;
me, who love her dearly, and only wish to see her lit-&#xD;
tle faults corrected. Pray, permit me to carry to her&#xD;
your kind forgiveness."&#xD;
"You are too good, Mrs. Nickson--quite too for-&#xD;
bearing ; she must first learn what it is to.displease a&#xD;
father, to brave his anger."&#xD;
"Let me implore you, sir, consider her unfortunate&#xD;
training; I beseech you to remit your severity, and&#xD;
smile on the child. Your frowns are too terrible to&#xD;
bear ; the weight of your displeasure too crushing."&#xD;
. " Since you condescend to interest yourself -so&#xD;
charmingly in my unworthy daughter, I will relent ;&#xD;
but she must fully understand to whom she owes her&#xD;
forgiveness; and must-humbly beg your pardon."&#xD;

have her shut up when there was dusting and run&#xD;
Wing to do, she made no mention of terms in h&#xD;
summons, and also managed so adroitly, that the&#xD;
wise papa was satisfied of her contrition.&#xD;
But no-sooner were they seated at dinner than he&#xD;
cropped out in fresh desires to pursue investigations&#xD;
upon the unfortunate maid's educational attainments ;&#xD;
whether self-prompted or set on by the blonde, I&#xD;
cannot tell; and' he opened upon her with a variety&#xD;
of examination questions. If any of my young read-&#xD;
ers have ever been thus suddenly and unexpectedly&#xD;
brought up to such searching tests of scholarship,&#xD;
they may comprehend the absolute vacuity of Kitty's&#xD;
mind, from which scurried away everything she ever&#xD;
knew, hiding in unfindable corners, leaving, her over-&#xD;
whelmed with confusion and mortification.&#xD;
"What and where is Malta, Miss Clayton?"&#xD;
Kitty seemed to know that Jim was a Maltese cat,&#xD;
and almost remembered hearing Henry say his love&#xD;
of olives and raisins came from his birthright; and&#xD;
she felt that something must be said, the silence was&#xD;
so dreadful; so she falteringly replied, "A city of&#xD;
Athens, I think, papa."&#xD;
"An excellent commencement," replied her father&#xD;
grimly. "Now then, what is Gibraltar, andto whom&#xD;
does it belong?"&#xD;
Kitty remembered the yellow streak on the map&#xD;
which located the thing, and reasoned that it must&#xD;
naturally belong to one of its two neighbors, so she&#xD;
said:&#xD;
&#xD;

" It is a fort, sir, belonging to Spain-or Portu-&#xD;

" Remarkable, upon my word ! Well, what is&#xD;
thunder?"&#xD;
" An awful noise," stammered Kitty.&#xD;
" Dangerous, I suppose?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, very ; kills people."&#xD;
"We will turj   the science of arithmetic ; I dare&#xD;
say you are equally proficient there. If A. doeg a&#xD;

Kitty wet her parched tongue as well as she could,&#xD;
and having added the two numbers together, gave it&#xD;
as her opinion that twelve was the result ; but on&#xD;
being asked sharply, "twelve what? " was uncertain&#xD;
whether it might be twelve days, twelve men, or&#xD;
twelve pieces of work.&#xD;
" Upon my soul, this is refreshing," said Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton; " you also learned, I presume, spelling."&#xD;
" Yes, sir, a little."&#xD;

hand, the district school hard by the Red Cottage."&#xD;
" An admirable suggestion," acquiesced Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton. "I will immediately act upon it. Kitty, prepare&#xD;
yourself to enter directly,' and I hope you will en-&#xD;
deavor to make up for lost time."&#xD;
"Oh, papa ! don't send me there among those dirty_&#xD;
-boys and girls. I can't go, indeed; let me study by&#xD;
myself. I will be industrious."&#xD;
"As you /ave been, probably. No, Kitty, you&#xD;
deserve a punishment for such a waste of your op-&#xD;
portunities, and I consider this a proper sentence.&#xD;
You need not attempt to reason with me ; it is useless.&#xD;
You will obey me."&#xD;
Kitty rose and hastened away.&#xD;
"You will not feel all this care too much, I trust,&#xD;
Mrs. Nickson," said the gentleman considerately, as&#xD;
they rose from the table.&#xD;
" Ah ! that hateful name," murm-ured Belle, sink-&#xD;
ing down upon a sofa; "how much longer must I&#xD;
bear it.?"&#xD;
Mr. Clayton came,, over and sat down beside her&#xD;
and took her hand in his.&#xD;
" My poor girl needs a mother sadly," said he.Ir&#xD;
"In any other circumstances I should think it a crime&#xD;
to speak what I am going to utter, but thrown in your&#xD;
society, studying your transparent goodness, I can-&#xD;
not hold my peace. If I am able to procure free-&#xD;
dom for you to form new ties, may I hope that after&#xD;
&#xD;
GHOSTS ON ROLLERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
329&#xD;
&#xD;
a suitable time elapses I may be so blessed as to call&#xD;
you mine."&#xD;
Belle trembled, quite shook, in fact ; he, holding her&#xD;
beautiful dimpled fingers, felt the tremor and pitied&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"I can never face the terrible ordeal, the publicity,&#xD;
the shame. I fear I must try to fare on to the end. I&#xD;
sometimes think it will come soon."&#xD;
" Do not speak thus, I pray you. It is easily got-&#xD;
ten over, a mere form of law. Your wrongs are so&#xD;
self-evident. I apprehend no trouble. I will take&#xD;
the whole management of the business, only promise&#xD;
me what I ask."&#xD;
"But it seems so wicked to speak of such a thing.&#xD;
I am hij wife. I cannot think further than to desire&#xD;
my freedom from his hateful power.&#xD;
"I will not press a subject from which I see you&#xD;
shrink. Dear Belle, perhaps I am hasty. Indeed,&#xD;
you convince me that I am, and permit me to. say I&#xD;
respect your scruples, and will forbear to intrude any&#xD;
further arguments."&#xD;
The blonde stole a little peep, at his face in adjust-&#xD;
ing her mouchoir, she feared having said too much for&#xD;
her purpose., " Thank you," she replied, returning&#xD;
his hand-squeeze; "and you will not leave me till it is&#xD;
over ? "&#xD;
"Leave you! no, indeed. You must accompany&#xD;
me to Toptown, and the sooner we go the better."&#xD;
That was precisely Belle's opinion, because her un-&#xD;
certain renegade of a, husband might take it into his&#xD;

blundering head to return at any inopportune mo-&#xD;
ment, and she sweetly assented to his proposition to&#xD;
get off early'in the week, only delaying long enough&#xD;
to receive and set up the costly new furniture she had&#xD;
purchased for the Folly.&#xD;
" Ought I not to have a lawyer to attend to the&#xD;
settlements, or maintenance, or whatever dreadful&#xD;
word they use ? " asked she, innocently.&#xD;
"No, madam, I cannot consent that you should&#xD;
touch a penny of this wretch's money. I have plenty,&#xD;
and in any event I will make you an equal sharer with&#xD;
Kitty in my fortune, of whom I hope you will never&#xD;
lose sight.'&#xD;
It was a pity, but could not be helped; and Belle&#xD;
dared not seem anxious to keep the wealth of the&#xD;
man she was about to cut loose from, however much&#xD;
she hated to let it slip through her grasping fingers.&#xD;
Mr., Clayton looked too firm, and, after all, what did&#xD;
it matter since he could bestow all she desired, and&#xD;
she very sweetly expressed her thanks, and promised&#xD;
to be a dear friend and adviser to darling Mignonne,&#xD;
with tears in her eyes.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
YOUNG LOVE AND OLD LOVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ISS WALSINGHAM had been absent in&#xD;
Roaring River, and she heard on her .return&#xD;
the news of the unexpected arrival and its&#xD;
attending circumstances.&#xD;
How Paul Clayton had appeared,.in Mrs. Nickson's&#xD;
company, and carried off Kitty to dwell at the Folly.&#xD;
If Carlotta had been the raconteur, I will not answer&#xD;
for any scathing, comments she might have added&#xD;
upon the deportment of the two new allies-but I am&#xD;
proverbially mild, and I contented myself with bare&#xD;
facts. I also advised Miss Walsingham to pay the&#xD;
child a visit immediately. I had been twice to the&#xD;
Folly, but had failed to see her either time, her ex-&#xD;
cuses being made in the blandest manner by the&#xD;
affable hostess: "Cherie was practising; ,Mignonne&#xD;
was putting up ferns." And Mr. Clayton's behavior,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7819-00000166"/>&#xD;
though courteous, was so extremely distant that I&#xD;
felt myself unwelcome.&#xD;
The stout lady was quite ready to go-setting out&#xD;
immediately to see her young : darling, and also,&#xD;
perhaps, to get a glimpse of her old one, though such&#xD;
a wish was not confessed to herself. All the way up&#xD;
she was thinking of him, and the pleasant school-&#xD;
days, of the sweet-faced boy in roundabouts, the&#xD;
ruddy youth, the" handsome young man, who had&#xD;
never loved her, but who had been so precious and&#xD;
so worthy that she had preferred his memory to any&#xD;
other love ; and she pulled in her horses with a jerk&#xD;
when she came, upon Kitty, muffled in a shawl, sit-&#xD;
ting under a great elm, whose few brown leaves&#xD;
were whiffling . and whirling on the -high boughs&#xD;
above her, while she silently dropped great tears,&#xD;
looking toward the Red Cottage, even as the Israel-&#xD;
ites wept when they remembered Zion-" when there&#xD;
was lamentation generally upon the housetops, and&#xD;
their hearts sounded for Judah like pipes wherein is&#xD;
no pleasure."  She could discern our chimney-stacks,&#xD;
and sheltering evergreens, but had been refused pe-&#xD;
mission to run down and see us for a little while,&#xD;
sternly refused ; we being represented to Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton as arch plotters, and improper advisers for his&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
Why, Kitty, child ! what is the matter?"&#xD;
Perhaps it was not quite right; yet who can blame&#xD;
the. little maid, so straightened, hedged about, and&#xD;
hemmed in as she was, that she impulsively, joy-&#xD;
&#xD;
333&#xD;
&#xD;
fully threw herself into the arms of her true friend,&#xD;
who possessed the sympathy she longed for, the love&#xD;
she craved, the tenderness she needed, and poured&#xD;
her complaints, her trials, her sufferings into her&#xD;
bosom. She climbed eagerly into the car iage and&#xD;
snuggled close, and spoke in a whisper, half afraid of&#xD;
what she was doing-afraid that it was disloyalty&#xD;
to her papa-but wholly unable to keep back the&#xD;
words which must come and the tears which would&#xD;
flow.&#xD;
Miss 'Walsingham listened in amazement. "The&#xD;
district-school ! nonsense-absurdity ! Is the man&#xD;
mad? Come with me till I see what he looks like."&#xD;
"It was not papa, auntie; he did not think of it ;&#xD;
it was Belle. I cannot blame papa. He asked me&#xD;
questions I could not answer-he frightened me so-&#xD;
he thinks I do not know anything-I am not wise-&#xD;
but I think if he had been a little softer with me, and&#xD;
she had not been there looking at me so dreadfully,&#xD;
I could have done better. Oh, auntie, what a pity&#xD;
she met papa at the hotel! If I could only have seen&#xD;
him first--oh I am so unhappy !-I don't -know what&#xD;
to do."&#xD;
"If that young scapegrace, Archie, had been&#xD;
worth a dump, I could see my way clear. What is it&#xD;
that men find in this woman so irresistible ? I don't&#xD;
consider her charming in the least," grumbled the&#xD;
stout lady.' "Come along, darling," she added,&#xD;
aloud. "' Maybe I can straighten some of the tan-&#xD;
gles;' I'll try, anyhow. Well, who could have fore-&#xD;

seen such a coil as this ? 'Satan came also,' sure&#xD;
enough."&#xD;
"-Let me, out, please, auntie; I don't want to go in.&#xD;
I keep out of the way as, much as I . can-I'd rather&#xD;
wait here for you. I hope Carlie or some of them&#xD;
will come ; I think they are cruel to stop away so."&#xD;
Aunt Elinor gave her her wish, determined to-&#xD;
bring matters to a crisis with Mrs. Nickson, and put&#xD;
an end to the sort of persecution Kitty was undergo-&#xD;
ing. In five minutes' time, the romance of a life was&#xD;
scattered like chaff before the wind. Usheredinto&#xD;
the presence of a stoop-shouldered, bald-headed,&#xD;
yellow-faced person, she looked aghast, trying vainly&#xD;
to discover any likeness to her young, fresh, fair,&#xD;
beautiful Paul; and she sourly regarded him as she&#xD;
propounded her queries.&#xD;
"You have grown stout, Elinor," said Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton, not admiringly.&#xD;
"Humph, you haven't; but you have grown old ;&#xD;
I never should have known you--don't know. you&#xD;
now-there isn't a trace of your youth left."&#xD;
" You are disposed to be complimentary, I see ;&#xD;
you always were outspoken, I remember, and time&#xD;
has evidently not softened that characteristic; years&#xD;
are tolerably sure to leave marks. I believe I must&#xD;
own that you resemble little the slender beauty I&#xD;
used to carry over Bradshaw's brook, and lift from&#xD;
one mossy stone to another at Petrifying Spring, in.&#xD;
our bread-and-butter days. I fear I should not dare&#xD;
attempt the feat now."&#xD;
&#xD;
" I-ho.pe not. Well ! I feel as if I had been to a&#xD;
funeral."&#xD;
"With little Paul for the corpse, I understand-I&#xD;
buried little Elinor long ago."&#xD;
"There ! that will suffice ; let by-gones be by-&#xD;
gones. You are a shrewd business man, I suppose ;&#xD;
a successful one, I know ; and can grasp a subject&#xD;
completely. What I want to talk about now is this&#xD;
school-scheme. I won't hear of Kitty's being shut in&#xD;
among those rough animals. It is the most ridiculous&#xD;
project ever originated."&#xD;
"I cannot agree with you, Elinor. I am deter-&#xD;
mined to have her make a beginning. She is igno-&#xD;
rant to a miracle."&#xD;
"Stuff and nonsense ! She knows plenty. You&#xD;
jumped at her like a wolf, like a spider ! and fright-&#xD;
ened her out of her senses. She is intelligent enough&#xD;
for-a woman, and as good as she is pretty-a daughter&#xD;
any man might be proud of."&#xD;
"Perhaps any man might; but I assure you I am&#xD;
very far from being proud of Miss Kitty; on the con&#xD;
trary, I am exceedingly disappointed in'her ; she has&#xD;
neither accomplishments nor learning."&#xD;
" Why have you not looked after the poor lamb in&#xD;
all these years, when you have kept yourself nobody&#xD;
knows where ? and she has wept her silly heart out&#xD;
over your indifference and neglect, and now you gal-&#xD;
lop in all at once, and stab her with hard questions,&#xD;
lock her out of your confidence, and make her life a&#xD;
burden ! What kind of a father do you call your-&#xD;

&#xD;
A shocking bad one,, Elinor. I've been over that&#xD;
same ground myself, I acknowledge it. I had a sort&#xD;
of idea that women grow like roses by the sweet&#xD;
juices within them ; and I must say I was shocked&#xD;
by 'the notion that Katrina's daughter could be&#xD;
faulty and unpleasant, to say nothing 'of ignorance.&#xD;
You see I am speaking quite freely, as to an -old friend.&#xD;
I hope it is not too late to remedy the defects and re-&#xD;
form the faults in my wayward girl's character."&#xD;
"Paul Clayton, you don't know what you are talk-&#xD;
ing about. You have evidently had your opinions&#xD;
premade for you. by one who is no friend to Kitty.&#xD;
I am not in the habit of decrying my sex to yours ;&#xD;
but I am going to.speak plainly now. I see quite&#xD;
clearly what this all means-though I confess I don't&#xD;
see any object to be gained-it must be pure malice&#xD;
-devilish wickedness.  I am in Mrs.. Nickson's&#xD;
house, but I shall not let that hinder my speaking the&#xD;
truth about her-a dangerous, lying, cheating, tricky,&#xD;
dishonest creature-who dislikes Kitty, and has&#xD;
wronged, and distressed, and misused her in a thou-&#xD;
sand ways, and is doing her best to turn you bitter&#xD;
toward her.. If you have a spark of wisdom, you will&#xD;
take your daughter away from her-take yourself&#xD;
away-don't you know she is a flirt, a Married&#xD;
Belle?"&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Walsingham! how delighted I ani to&#xD;
welcome you at My Folly."&#xD;
"Your folly, indeed," muttered Aunt Elinor, who&#xD;
had risen to her feet at the first sound of her hostess'&#xD;
&#xD;
YOUNG LOVE AND OLD LOVE.&#xD;
voice ; and almost felt as if she had done wrong in her&#xD;
plain speaking under this roof.&#xD;
"I trust we may be excellent neighbors. I am&#xD;
fortunate, you perceive, in my first guests. I have&#xD;
been looking for you. I knew you couldn't long stop&#xD;
away. Such an acquaintance as yours with Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ton is quite likely to seek renewal. I used to hear&#xD;
our Roaring River friends say that you were lovers&#xD;
once-childish lovers-and [With an arch look] I'm&#xD;
going to tell it all, Miss Walsingham. I know you&#xD;
won't mind now : they said that Elinor Walsinghani&#xD;
loved so very dearly Paul Clayton that she refused&#xD;
everybody else."&#xD;
" What is your object, Mrs. Nickson, in pouring&#xD;
out this folly ? " said Aunt Elinor, quite white.&#xD;
"Oh, nothing ! I had no idea you would care, at&#xD;
your age. I thought old women outlived all emo-&#xD;
tions of that sort."&#xD;
"You are right for once ; they do. I have outlived&#xD;
any such youthful folly I may have had, entirely."&#xD;
Mr. Clayton stood silent, while the blonde floated&#xD;
up to the stout lady, laughing musically, and seized&#xD;
her hand j she brought her creamy beauty in sharp&#xD;
contrast with the middle-aged face, settled into lines,&#xD;
and she rejoiced inly when she saw that he was un-&#xD;
consciously comparing them in his mind.&#xD;
"Forgive me," said she, in her most gushing man-&#xD;
ner ; "it was only a little fun. I did not mean to&#xD;
tease. I am matronly and sober now, staid and ad-&#xD;
visable. I have buried youthful follies. I am going&#xD;

to begin a new life. I. mean~ to make a good man&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
Though Aunt Elinor had snatched away her hand,&#xD;
she did not take her.eyes from those of the hand-&#xD;
some speaker.  She also felt the magnetic -power&#xD;
this Lamia exerted-'" this palpitating snake ;" and,&#xD;
she had half a mind to disbelieve the past, and regard&#xD;
this lady bright-this full-blown beauty, ripe and ex-&#xD;
quisite-as an angel of light. It was not till she saw'&#xD;
Mr. Clayton watching intensely the blonde,drinking&#xD;
in her words, that she got back all her' senses, and&#xD;
uneasily felt that there must be more than met the&#xD;
ear in her smooth speech.&#xD;
"Belle," exclaimed she, half-sorrowfully, " if you&#xD;
took half the pains to be, that you squander upon 'to&#xD;
seem,' what a woman you would make ! I know&#xD;
what I am saying, Mr. Clayton, quite well. I am no&#xD;
slanderer. I am able to substantiate all my asser-&#xD;
tions. I only make them for Kitty's sake-"&#xD;
Oh, you are speaking of our new plan for Kitty.&#xD;
I am the instigator of that. I claim the credit, and&#xD;
I am willing to take a good deal of trouble to perfect&#xD;
the result. Believe me, you must soon acknowledge&#xD;
me right."&#xD;
"Mr. Clayton," continued Aunt Elinor, ignoring&#xD;
the interruption, "let me have the child. Let me&#xD;
teach her. Come, I am a lonely woman-I love Kitty&#xD;
-I'll adopt her ; take her off your hands directly !"&#xD;
Such a consummation suited not at all the blonde,&#xD;
Who in her projected future saw great use for a pair&#xD;
&#xD;
YOUNG LOVE AND OLD LOVE.    339&#xD;
&#xD;
of willing hands and .ready feet, and had no wish to,&#xD;
helpKitty to such a life of ease and luxury, and Mr.,&#xD;
Clayton replied with his eyes upon the enchantress'&#xD;
face:&#xD;
"Do not compel me to be rude, Elinor. I cannot&#xD;
alter my plans, even to please an old friend, although&#xD;
I heartily thank you."&#xD;
"That is clever of you, sir. I feared you. might be&#xD;
tempted to disappoint me of a pleasure I have set my&#xD;
heart, upon-Cherie's company.- Ah ! by the way;&#xD;
Miss Walsingham, what do you hear from Mr. Laurie ?&#xD;
I saw a good deal of him in Toptown; he stopped at&#xD;
my hotel; he is quite a presentable youth. I rather&#xD;
entered him on my list of friends."&#xD;
"I'll see you again, sir," replied Aunt Elinor hur w&#xD;
riedly, "and give you one more opportunity to prove&#xD;
yourself '.a man ; of sense and judgment. If I stay&#xD;
any longer now I shall lose my temper."&#xD;
Belle's ringing 1augh floated after her as she stalked&#xD;
away, grumbling, "Well, if anybody had told me I&#xD;
could ever in my life have such a scold with: Paul&#xD;
'Clayton, I couldn't have' believed it. Dear, dear !&#xD;
what a world this is!"&#xD;
"A very eccentric woman, Mr. Clayton," said the&#xD;
blonde; "that sort of personality grows out of a sel-&#xD;
fish life, I suppose, sir, with masculine pursuits. She&#xD;
rears pigs and calves. I've heard her talk about them&#xD;
with such-odd language " (he smiled at her lovely, hor-&#xD;
rified face, wide-open, blue eyes, and thought how&#xD;
handsome she was, -how complete in womanhood !)&#xD;

I heard her calling me names just now, but I freely&#xD;
forgive her she was disappointed that I could not f:I&#xD;
in love with the gawky nephew ; I never could admire&#xD;
salad greenness.&#xD;
Kitty was awaiting Aunt Elinor under the tree.&#xD;
"Don't give up, child," she finished, after announcing&#xD;
her ill-success. "I'll pull through yet-I've the great-&#xD;
est mind to carry you off now. Come, jump up and I'll&#xD;
turn my back on them, and keep you in spite of them."&#xD;
" Oh na, auntie. I must obey papa; I'm not go=&#xD;
ing to be unhappy any more if I can help it: I will&#xD;
do niy best, and -maybe he will see after a while that I&#xD;
nean to be good, and get to like me."&#xD;
Aunt Elinor touched up her horses with a short&#xD;
goodaby she couldn't bear the patient, sorrowful tes-&#xD;
ignationi of the child, and she drove home full of in-&#xD;
dignation against Archie, "not worth a dump," and&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
ONE WAS TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT.&#xD;
ONDAY niorning came, and Kitty was bidden&#xD;
to make ready for the district school. She had&#xD;
also by Belle's directions been habited in a&#xD;
dark calico dress and check gingham apron, as suitable&#xD;
apparel, but if the blonde meant to humble or annoy&#xD;
her by such a choice, shefailed utterly, for the simple,&#xD;
childish clothing suited her, and she looked as pretty&#xD;
as a pink. She sat alone in her room, leaning her&#xD;
face in her hands, waiting for half-past eight, when&#xD;
she must set off. Nobody can tell how she dreaded&#xD;
it, but she was quietly trying to make the best of it,&#xD;
and fully determined to study hard, to please her&#xD;
father; and as she heard him pacing up and lown his&#xD;
room opposite, she wished she dared go in and tell him&#xD;
so, and was fluttering- with the thought,  hen her&#xD;
door opened and he walked in.&#xD;
Mr. Clayton, infatuated as he was, had. had some&#xD;

<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7819-00000171"/>&#xD;
ONE WAS TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT.    341&#xD;
&#xD;
hours of sober reflection since Miss Walsingham's visit.&#xD;
Carlotta also had waylaid the man and persisted in&#xD;
adding her say-so to that of his old .friend; elabor-&#xD;
ating her opinions of our darling, her purity and good-&#xD;
ness ; and really, in going over her conduct he began&#xD;
to fear that he might have been too severe. He could&#xD;
not help seeing, that she had been uniformly gentle,&#xD;
patient, and obedient since his coming, though most of&#xD;
the time unpleasantly tearful and drooping. In face&#xD;
of the step he was about to take he had passed a wake-&#xD;
ful night. The old-time feelings, the habits of a life-&#xD;
time, would not be thrust aside withoutia final strug-&#xD;
gle ; the memories of poor Katrina had thronged&#xD;
around him during the still hours, and some regretful&#xD;
tenderness for the child she had borne him, some dis-&#xD;
agreeable, remorseful suggestions, " he had not made&#xD;
her happy, had shown her no fatherliness," and he&#xD;
wished to speak a few words before he left her, to let&#xD;
her know that he did not mean to be harsh or unkind ;&#xD;
the fact that he desired to do so'secretly, 'might have&#xD;
proved to hin, if he had been at the trouble to analyze&#xD;
the impulse, how much and' what sort of power the&#xD;
Married Belle. had-over him.&#xD;
Kitty started to her feet at his voice, and after one&#xD;
look in his eyes, she sprang to hisheart.&#xD;
" Oh, papa, you will love me," pleaded she. "I&#xD;
will try so hard to be wise. I am not bad, papa,&#xD;
believe me ; and I am so lonely. I have got nobody&#xD;
in the wide world but you, if you will only try to&#xD;
forgive my faults."&#xD;
&#xD;
Sitting down, and taking her on his knee, half&#xD;
ashamed of the fond action, he looked at her, and un-&#xD;
derstood the still strength which was keeping back her&#xD;
tears, because she knew he disliked them ; and the pa-&#xD;
tient smile she showed him, and her beseeching eyes,&#xD;
were too much : he put his arms around her with a&#xD;
good, fatherly hug, mentally resolving that whatever&#xD;
he might do, this child should not be made to suffer&#xD;
any more. He talked a long time, assuring her of his&#xD;
love, and real interest, in_ low, kind tones, and his&#xD;
wishes for her best good, and though she hardly spoke&#xD;
a word in reply, he left her the happiest girl in the&#xD;
world. Though he returned to his room and she de-&#xD;
scended the stairs alone, Belle was astonished at her&#xD;
beaming face.&#xD;
It was the appointed day for the Toptown journey,&#xD;
and the blonde was habited foi a start "pacing si-&#xD;
lentty about in pale, contented sort of discontent."&#xD;
Kitty accepted her good-by kiss, and oh ! how glad&#xD;
she was afterward that she had parted kindly with her!&#xD;
how devoutly thankful for the reconciliation, and pre-&#xD;
cious hour she had enjoyed with her papa ! and she&#xD;
set off to the old sc1 ool-house with a light heart.&#xD;
As Mr. Clayton had foreseen, the divorce business&#xD;
was a mere form; what God hath joined together&#xD;
is put asunder with perfect facility nowadays. And&#xD;
the instant the judge set eyes upon Mrs. Nickson,&#xD;
he felt that such beauty, grace, innocence, and sweet-&#xD;
ness must not remain married to any wretch incapa-&#xD;
ble of appreciating them, and he gave his decision&#xD;

342   ONE WAS TAKEN, 'THE OTHER LEFT.&#xD;

344   NE WAS TAKEN, THE OTfER LEFT&#xD;
with a flourish and a compliment, and Belle Brandon&#xD;
was herself again.&#xD;
There was a long time to wait, and somehow the&#xD;
blonde felt uncomfortable in the hotel where she had&#xD;
sat about with Archie Laurie, where she had gotten&#xD;
a blow from her husband, and she begged for a drive.&#xD;
Her perfect organization stood her in good stead,&#xD;
and she threw away the gloom which desired to&#xD;
enshroud her, the presentiments' of evil; and after a&#xD;
long drive, a choice dinner, a couple of glasses of&#xD;
champagne, she was in radiant humor ; whatever&#xD;
forebodings, doubts, or misgivings the gentleman&#xD;
had felt, were entertained no longer ; they vanished'&#xD;
like ugly shadows in the bright presence of this&#xD;
gifted creature he was going to marry.&#xD;
The train was late, and the short autumn twilight&#xD;
was long passed, and the night darkness had long&#xD;
settled over all objects, before the great red eye of&#xD;
their speeding engine glared upon Graceville, the last'&#xD;
station before Merry Bank. Some people entering&#xD;
the car brought dripping umbrellas and streaming&#xD;
water-proofs among the passengers, and a general&#xD;
exclamation, "What a sudden storm!" passed from&#xD;
mouth to mouth. Flashes of vivid lightning illumi-&#xD;
nated the landscape just an instant, and left darkness&#xD;
that might be felt, and heavy rolling thunder pealed&#xD;
above them. Belle was leaning on Mr. Clayton's&#xD;
arm with a new sense of security ; he was talking to,&#xD;
her, picturing a life with her for its queen and glory;&#xD;
and while she silently listened, perhaps a glimmering&#xD;
&#xD;
ONE WAS TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT.       34&#xD;
desire 'lighted the r cesses of her soul, inhabited by&#xD;
selfishness, craft, lies, dishonesty, to realize the ex-&#xD;
pectations of this upright man, to be a good wife to&#xD;
him, wondering if it were possible. I say perhaps,&#xD;
because there were interfoldings of Belle 'Brandon's&#xD;
character I never could safely pronounce upon with&#xD;
all my careful study; at any rate she looked as sweet&#xD;
and nice as woman could. Mr. Clayton thought so:&#xD;
"her opened eyes, where 'he was mirrored small in&#xD;
Paradise," were as blue as a summer heaven, and her&#xD;
ripe' lips parted in a contented smile 'showed all the&#xD;
dimples.&#xD;
After the train left Graceville, he rose, putting her&#xD;
gently from him, to look out of an opposite window ;&#xD;
she followed him with her glance. When he with-&#xD;
drew his caressing arm, what meant the '-strange&#xD;
emotion .which passed through her with a chilly&#xD;
shiver, as if everything true was gone forever, and her&#xD;
day of grace shut down by throbbing darkness -a&#xD;
sharp, crashing sound-smote her ears, and before she&#xD;
could breathe, something fearful tore the car to&#xD;
atoms; she saw it crushing the seats, splintering'&#xD;
them to fragments ; she saw it strike Paul Clayton,&#xD;
dashing him down ; he' fell at her very feet, splash-&#xD;
ing her with his blood. Everything human around her&#xD;
was mangled, lacerated, despoiled of God's image,&#xD;
promiscuously dishonored among rubbish.  In the&#xD;
universal wail and terrible pang which cleft .the dark-&#xD;
ness, rising above the storm, quenching the noise of the&#xD;
rushing train, petrifying the inhabitants of the shut-up&#xD;

houses, she Was alone ! All other souls Were divorced&#xD;
and fled. Then a terrible arrest, a violent shock, a&#xD;
grinding, leaping overthrow. The train off the -track&#xD;
and nothing left but chaos. A loose rail had been&#xD;
lifted by a stone, and so propped that the revolving&#xD;
wheel tore it higher and higher, and sent it through&#xD;
the car.- A discharged workman was tried for the&#xD;
deed afterward, but as nothing could be proven he&#xD;
was set loose. Belle let go her hold upon the cross-&#xD;
bar which she had instinctively clutched, add climbed&#xD;
out over ghastly things, through pogls of blood yet&#xD;
warm from human hearts ; she saw many lights, a&#xD;
crowd surging and swaying ; nobody observed her,&#xD;
and she stepped away, stumbling on through the&#xD;
storm.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
ARCHIE'S CONFESSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE first day in the old school-house was&#xD;
over, and like the man who, on being asked&#xD;
how he enjoyed the concert, replied, ' Well,&#xD;
I didn't suffer as much as I expected" Kitty told&#xD;
us she had got through quite nicely; told us over&#xD;
our garden fence, because the prohibition against&#xD;
visiting us was not removed, and she dutifully&#xD;
returned to the Folly, feelinga sort of responsibility&#xD;
there in the absence of its mistress. After conning-&#xD;
her lessons.(Kitty meant to make thorough work&#xD;
now), and practising her exercises, she felt tired, and&#xD;
strolled into the great drawing-room where she had&#xD;
first seen Archie that fateful evening, standing in the&#xD;
very spot where she had danced the first quadrille,&#xD;
and she dropped down upon the soft carpet among&#xD;
the roses and posies, and she buried herself in her&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7819-00000174"/>&#xD;
ARCHIE'S CONFESSION.        349&#xD;
&#xD;
thoughts so absorbingly that she did not hear the&#xD;
door-bell, nor the approach of a-step on the thick&#xD;
piled tapis.&#xD;
" Kitty," said a well-beloved voice, "Kitty, I&#xD;
heard that you were alone, but I did not expect to&#xD;
find you so much alone that I must make my own&#xD;
way to you like the Prince entering the castle in&#xD;
search of Lady.Delight; will you rise, and bid me&#xD;
welcome?"&#xD;
She sprang up and looked in his eyes. He was&#xD;
smiling, but rather shamefaced, not to say sheepish;&#xD;
he' evidently felt the discomfort of his position as&#xD;
much asthe angriest mistress could desire..&#xD;
"I have made a great fool of myself, Kitty," said&#xD;
be, ".a great fool."&#xD;
"I know it, Archie," she replied frankly.&#xD;
"Dearest Kitty, how pale you are !"&#xD;
"4Yes, Archie; I have suffered a good deal since.&#xD;
you saw me last."&#xD;
"Did you receive the letter I wrote you up among&#xD;
the lumbermen? ""&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"Why did you not answer it? were you too an-&#xD;
gry?"&#xD;
You did not ask me, and I did not feel like forc-&#xD;
ing a letter upon you.".&#xD;
"I expected it, though. I looked, and watched,&#xD;
and waited."S&#xD;
You should have said so, then ; I never run after&#xD;
people:."'&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
" Can youforgive my ridiculous folly, Kitty? I&#xD;
have suffered ; I deserved to suffer, You can never&#xD;
know the bitter humiliation it was, to be forced to&#xD;
own such madness as mine. I don't think half so&#xD;
much of Archie Laurie as I did six months ago."&#xD;
Kitty made no reply, but moved the toe of her&#xD;
boot among the petals of a great red poppy in the&#xD;
carpet, and did not look up either, though her color&#xD;
flickered and her lips trembled.&#xD;
"Kitty, I don't deserve any grace ; but be merci-&#xD;
ful ;,don't cast me off. If you do, Iam afraid I shall&#xD;
go to the devil-no, I won't say that. I have been&#xD;
as near to one as I ever mean to come ; but--I wish&#xD;
you could look at me ; at least, say you'forgive me&#xD;
before I leave you. You cannot ! I see it; you shrink&#xD;
from my presence ; well, I can't blame you ; I de-&#xD;
spise myself. Good-by, Kitty ; dear Kitty.; pre-&#xD;
cious Kitty; I must say so just once. I won't trou-&#xD;
ble you any more, but I'll tell you, if you was a poor&#xD;
fellow who came to me for forgiveness.and consola-&#xD;
tion, I wouldn't treat you as you treat me : I'd be&#xD;
kind, and say 'Dear Archie, yes, yes, of course I for-&#xD;
give you-come here and kiss me directly."&#xD;
The whole-hearted sorrow, mixed with humor and&#xD;
bravado, were too much for Kitty, who, burst into a&#xD;
laugh; " I do forgive you, Archie,"' said she.. "I&#xD;
forgave you long ago, but "--she faltered again-" I&#xD;
trusted you so thoroughly.",&#xD;
" Then' trust me once more and forever.  God&#xD;
knows I will-neverprove unwrthyiL " He reached out&#xD;

his hands, taking a -step towards her ; she laid her&#xD;
soft-fingers into them, and he. grasped them eagerly,&#xD;
and she rested her poor tired little head where she-&#xD;
had thought never to place it again. All the past was&#xD;
as if it had never been ; fearlessly and fondly she&#xD;
gave her happiness into his keeping. .&#xD;
Kitty dear?."&#xD;
Yes, Archie."&#xD;
You know the picture you sent me?"&#xD;
"I did not send it, Archie; did not know you had&#xD;
it till you wrote me. It was Aunt Elinor did that ; she&#xD;
wished to recall you to your duty. I felt very bad&#xD;
when I found it out."&#xD;
"I suppose so. I felt bad when I got it; I&#xD;
wouldn't live that time over for anything in this&#xD;
world."-&#xD;
".Not even to get forgiven again, Archie?"&#xD;
" No, ma'am ; I am very happy, but I should be&#xD;
happier if I had not tripped."&#xD;
"Oh well, Archie, it-is all past now; I shall. not&#xD;
think of it any more."&#xD;
"Thank you, Kitty; I haven't dared kiss the&#xD;
lovely face; I would not without your permission.&#xD;
May I kiss it now--may I kiss you ? "&#xD;
"Yes, Archie,,you may ; " she raised her head and&#xD;
looked-trustingly into his eyes. " There ! " she said,&#xD;
smiling; "now you are Prince Almanazar."&#xD;
"Now you are my Lady Delight."&#xD;
Neither spoke for a moment, but Kitty put her&#xD;
hands withinhis strong arm, her support from this&#xD;
&#xD;
time, and clasped them contentedly, leaning against&#xD;
his shoulder.&#xD;
"Kitty!"&#xD;
"Well, Archie!"&#xD;
"Do you mind because my hair won't curl?"&#xD;
She laughed one of her old merry, ringing melo-&#xD;
dies-soon checking herself, though. "But, Archie,&#xD;
I have a great deal to tell you. My papa is here."&#xD;
" I know all about it, dearest. This is Mrs. Nick-&#xD;
son's house; I hated to enter it, but I heard that you&#xD;
were alone. Carlotta told me, and bid me come di-&#xD;
rectly and make my peace. I am glad I found you&#xD;
in this very spot, because I nearly know you were&#xD;
thinking about me ; honest, now, weren't you ?"&#xD;
"Of course I was ; I remembered how you kicked&#xD;
up your heels in that polka.  But, Archien my&#xD;
papa-"&#xD;
"Yes, darling, I know ; he has gone to Toptown&#xD;
with Belle to get a divorce, and he means ,to marry&#xD;
her. I 'am glad to take you away from them. I&#xD;
ani going to give up the law ; I don't like it ; it brings&#xD;
too many knaves and fools about me. I feel as if I&#xD;
had been in shocking bad company ; and I'm going&#xD;
to settle down on Aunt Elinor's farm, and make a&#xD;
career where there won't be a dirty taste all the while&#xD;
in my mouth. I've talked it all over with her this&#xD;
evening, and she is just pleased."&#xD;
" Oh Archie, a divorce ! 'interrupted Kitty, as pale&#xD;
as a ghost-she had heard nothing else of all he was&#xD;
saying-" and to marry Belle Brandon! '.'&#xD;

Yes, darling; you may ,as well look it in the&#xD;
face ; it's coming as sure as fate. I don't blame her&#xD;
for wishing to be free ; that Nickson is a nasty scamp.&#xD;
I can't think of her becoming a tyrant to my little&#xD;
Kitty, though; you must promise not to let them,&#xD;
separate you frmn me."&#xD;
"'I could never disobey papa, Archie ;I don't think&#xD;
he will object:;'he was too good this morning. I have&#xD;
felt very unhappy. I thought he did not care for me&#xD;
at all,; I know better now ; I've had a talk with him.&#xD;
I shall never be afraid of him again."&#xD;
"He is under the influence of a dreadful woman;,&#xD;
he cannot, see things as, they are, but only as she&#xD;
shows them to him. Don't-I know all about that?"&#xD;
said Archie, grimly. "The .quickest way to disen-&#xD;
chant him will be to let him go ahead and marry&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"Oh, Archie! I hope nothing so terrible as that&#xD;
will ever happen. Poor papa ! he is only just begin-&#xD;
ning to he nice to me; and she will make him cross&#xD;
if she can-'&#xD;
Don't let's think about it this evening , Kitty;&#xD;
let's be happy; it is my private opinion that she,&#xD;
won't be Mrs. Clayton very long anyhow, There&#xD;
will be another divorce case in court. Perhaps some&#xD;
kind providence may stop it; don't borrow trouble.&#xD;
Come! when shall we two be made one? I am all&#xD;
ready to settle down. Auntie is impatient. Let's'&#xD;

through the length of the great room, who should&#xD;
walk in but the house-master, Mr. Nickson. He had&#xD;
on his overcoat, and a slouched hat from which the&#xD;
water dripped in little rivulets, and carried in his&#xD;
bony hand a stout riding-whip, with which he im-&#xD;
patiently, almost savagely, beat the air as, he ap-&#xD;
proached. For a wonder he was perfectly sober ;&#xD;
but there was a sense of still excitement over him-&#xD;
a cruel, vindictive look in his haggard face-t dan-&#xD;
gerous savageness.&#xD;
" You ! in my house, Mr. Archie  aurie ! (e n-&#xD;
found your impudence,") he mutt ed under s&#xD;
breath ; "waiting to see the madam, I suppose !"&#xD;
"No, sir," answered Archie, ignoring the inso&#xD;
lence of his manner, and pausing in front of him with&#xD;
Kitty on his arm, who shrank fearfully away; "I am&#xD;
conversing with my affianced syife, who was brought&#xD;
here by her father. Permit me to present you! "&#xD;
"Ah, Miss Kitty! she. is an old flame of mine !&#xD;
Wasn't you, my little dear? I congratulate you-&#xD;
upon my soul I do. I wish everybody vyas as lucky.&#xD;
I am glad you are here, both of you. I just as lives&#xD;
have witnesses. I expect a lady soon-Mrs. Nickson&#xD;
that was-Miss Brandon that is!"&#xD;
He struck out with the lithe whip, and laughed so&#xD;
discordantly, that Archie felt that it would be a -pity&#xD;
if a defenceless woman should have come into his&#xD;
power in that mood, and was-glad he was there ; and&#xD;
wondered how he heard the news, and if Belle would&#xD;
return alone or in Mr. Clayton's company.&#xD;

Folks think they have stole a march on me ; but,&#xD;
Lord bless you, I've been watching.; I could have&#xD;
stopped the game if I'd a wanted----"&#xD;
A slight noise made them turn, and Belle was stand-&#xD;
ing alone upon the threshold. Her dark dress was&#xD;
drabbled with mud, her hat crushed and-broken, and&#xD;
dripping with Water, and her face splashed with&#xD;
blood-stains, her eyes hollow, and her lips colorless.&#xD;
What are you- here for, madam ? How dare&#xD;
you enter my house !"&#xD;
" I have come home ! " she replied, in a still, faint&#xD;
voice ; "home to rest! I am very weary."&#xD;
"Rest here ! you? No, by Judas! not an hour-&#xD;
not a minute-a divorced thing! You have cut loose&#xD;
from me ! glad of it ; saves me the trouble and ex-&#xD;
pense. I am tired to death of the sight of you.  It&#xD;
was the plumiest thing you ever did. Your new lover&#xD;
is waiting outside, I suppose ; go find him.. I wish&#xD;
him joy of you ; go ! Do you hear'? before I do you&#xD;

me.a laughing-stock--eh ? How I hate you ! Come!'&#xD;

friends, if you ever get off without the beating you&#xD;
deserve.".&#xD;
"I will not stir out again in this storm ! You do&#xD;
not know to whom you ; are talking. I have been&#xD;
through a terrible scene ; as soon as the morning&#xD;
comes I wish to :go.  I must rest. I must think..&#xD;
I must prepare."  She passed her bloody. hand&#xD;
&#xD;
across her forehead, and staggering, leaned against&#xD;
the ivall. " I am ill."&#xD;
''No,'you don't. I know all your tricks. If you&#xD;
was dying you should go. Do you suppose I'could&#xD;
ever feel any pity for you? My best wish for you is&#xD;
that you may rot on a dunghill ! I've had three&#xD;
styles of wives ; and you are the most abominable of&#xD;
the whole ! Now I'm going to get a good, steady&#xD;
woman to- keep my house, save my money, and&#xD;
make me comfortable in my old age. Do you see&#xD;
the door ? "&#xD;
Out in this storm ! I will not be driven out ! I&#xD;
tell you I am too ill to stand. Keep your hands off !&#xD;
Oh!" &#xD;
" Mr. Nickson ! " exclaimed Archie, stepping for-&#xD;
ward, "do not ! something fearful has occurred ;&#xD;
see ! your wife's face is streaked.with blood."  .&#xD;
"Blood ! there will be more blood ! " shouted the&#xD;
furious man. A sharp blow had fallen upon the&#xD;
creamy fleshs-another and another. Archie used all&#xD;
his strength to overpower the raging devil, who held&#xD;
the defenceless woman in his grasp, and to wrench&#xD;
away his whip. The three-struggled on through the&#xD;
great hall, whose door stood wide open, and into&#xD;
which was beating the fierce rain, borne on wild,&#xD;
wailing wind-gusts. The helpless beauty ceased to&#xD;
struggle, and was pushed passively out; and Archie,&#xD;
trying to undo the ferocious clutch which gripped her&#xD;
so fast that. the horny hands bruised and tore the&#xD;
tender flesh, stumbled on the brink of the broad&#xD;

staircase leading upon the lawn, and narrowly es-&#xD;
caped. plunging down with the banker and the&#xD;
blonde, who fell from the top to the bottom in a&#xD;
mad plunge. When Archie picked himself up with&#xD;
a cut in his forehead from the sharp post which had&#xD;
stopped him, he felt dizzy ; and he heard a musical,&#xD;
terrible laugh, which rung piercingly on the air,&#xD;
swept toward him by the blast; and then came a&#xD;
stillness like: the grave. The heavy portal slammed&#xD;
together ; : and Archie vainly tried to undo the&#xD;
spring-lock which barred him from poor Kitty, alone.&#xD;
inside with all this horror. A persistent pull of the&#xD;
bell brought a shared servant at last, who peered fear-&#xD;
fully out. He pushed pastier, and rushing forward,&#xD;
he found Kitty unconscious on the floor. Pressing&#xD;
the white-lipped female into his service, he carried&#xD;
her to her room and left her, while he set out to&#xD;
search for the others.- -The banker was stretched&#xD;
helpless upon the flags, completely stunned, but no&#xD;
bones broken; and after a. good deal of effort, was&#xD;
gotten to his apartment, from which he did not go&#xD;
out for many weeks.&#xD;
All search for the blonde was vain. Archie pro-&#xD;
cured a lantern and looked up and down everywhere.&#xD;
As he was slowly seeking through the avenue, flash-&#xD;
ing his light hither and thither, he came'upon a sight&#xD;
which stopped his heart-beats. Upon the gravel,&#xD;
"-cirque-couchant, sat a palpitating snake of dazzling&#xD;
hue, sapphire green and amethyst," her crested&#xD;
head raised proudly in the midst of her graceful coils,&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER THE LAST.&#xD;
GOOD-BY TO ALL.&#xD;
RCHIE LAURIE made an excellent farmer,&#xD;
but not a better than Pitkin Sterling. We&#xD;
had a double wedding at the Red Cottage.&#xD;
Mrs. .Pillhackle, Mrs. Rotterdam, and others, made&#xD;
remarks about Kitty's tting married in mourning.,&#xD;
Mrs. Ramble, for o ce, was on our side, whether&#xD;
from genuine goo  eeling for Kitty (she always did&#xD;
like the child), or certain looking forward to good&#xD;
things to be borrowed, or long visits- when she&#xD;
couldn't "stay a second hardly," I can't determine.&#xD;
At any rate, she was the only one of the; three who&#xD;
was present at the ceremony, and she stayed not for&#xD;
an invitation, but came promiscuously, and there were&#xD;
tears in her red eyes when she went up- and kissed&#xD;
our brides, one of whom came down in a dress of&#xD;
crape like wrinkled cream, and the other in lustrous&#xD;
&#xD;
satin. Carlotta always said no other fabric should&#xD;
enrobe her for her bridal. Though there was little&#xD;
merriment among us, we were sedately happy.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Sterling purchased the Folly, which&#xD;
they rechristened "Scotch Roses," with the farms&#xD;
belonging; and we did not lose. them. Carlotta is&#xD;
a more ardent Huishite than ever, and her banks are&#xD;
hummi ng with bees.&#xD;
Of course these occurrences were the talk of the&#xD;
town for a while, and some fierce opinions were in-&#xD;
terchanged, till a runaway match took up public at-&#xD;
tention, and we dropped back into primeval ob-&#xD;
scurity.&#xD;
If any of my readers desire to hear more of Belle&#xD;
Brandon, I will chronicle the fact that Carlotta and&#xD;
Kitty met her once afterward at the St. James. She&#xD;
was sitting at table with a gentleman; she was not&#xD;
married, because her- maiden name was on the regis-&#xD;
ter. If she saw them, she made no sign ; and though&#xD;
her beauty was faded and paled, she evidently forgot&#xD;
that her charming dimples had elongated into wrin-&#xD;
kles, and still smiled to show them off; and though&#xD;
streaks of gray had mingled with her blonde, curls,&#xD;
she still practised the artless toss, and continued her&#xD;
plotting and scheming to secure a husband,&#xD;
