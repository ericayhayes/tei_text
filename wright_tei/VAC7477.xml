MERRILY, merrily pealed the Christmas chiMes frox4 the.&#xD;
bells of old Trinity, as if to proclaim throughout the good city&#xD;
of New York that the year eighteen hundred ani fifteen was&#xD;
near its -close. In many a genial, gathering were those. peals&#xD;
echoed by merry laughter, and even the inmates of those gloomy&#xD;
gaols which then disfigured the Park, rejoiced, for they knew&#xD;
that on the morrow their cells would be irradiated, by the hos-&#xD;
pitable light of good cheer. Yet the grim head of death peeps&#xD;
through every garland of flowers, and in one mansion those&#xD;
merry chimes sounded like a funeral knell.&#xD;
It was one of those spacious, substantial brick edifiles, which&#xD;
yet grace the lower extremity of the "commercial metropolis,"&#xD;
and which were then the abodes of those merchant princes who&#xD;
now inhabit broad. avenues and high-minded streets far away.&#xD;
No expense had been spared in its construction, nor had the&#xD;
furniture been selected with a niggardly hand. Costly paint&#xD;
ings decked the parlor walls; the curtains were of the heaviesti&#xD;
damask; massive plate loaded the broad side-board, and the&#xD;
contents of richly-cut decanters in the pantry gate evidexice of&#xD;
a valuable stock of wines.&#xD;
Yet one chamber was furnished in tan antiquated, common&#xD;
manner, and there lay the okvner of all-John Spencer-on hI&#xD;
bed of death. Threescore years had paaed since he, a poor la&#xD;
had come to the city to make his fortune. He had auceededEi4&#xD;

4               THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
John Spencer and Son now ranked among the first in the com-&#xD;
mercial world, and sought in vain for new fields in which to&#xD;
speculate. He was passing rich in lands, and houses, and ships,&#xD;
and merchandise, yet what did all this avail him, aethe fearful&#xD;
shadow of the dark banner of the great balancer of accounts&#xD;
flapped before him! All his schemes. for money-making had&#xD;
vanished like bubbles on the water, and there was no expression&#xD;
of hope-either of regained health on earth or of peace beyond&#xD;
the, grave--in his glassy eyes.&#xD;
To and fro in the chamber, like a caged hyena, strode the&#xD;
dying man's'eldest son, partner and namesake, waiting for the&#xD;
moment when he would no longer have to add " junior ' to his&#xD;
signature. He was a short, thin man, with scanty chestnut-&#xD;
colored locks upon his pointed head, and a bland smile ever&#xD;
upon his countenance, which ill accorded with the cold, shrewd&#xD;
glances of his.gray eyes, or the compressed rigidity of his&#xD;
bloodless lips. Dressed in a thread-bare black suit, with a&#xD;
clumsily-tied white neck-cloth, he was the impersonation of&#xD;
money-getting, no matter how, if legally. Business tact was.&#xD;
the cardinal virtue of his narrow mind, and wealth constituted&#xD;
his only happiness. He was' training his son to walk in the&#xD;
same path,.&#xD;
Perhaps it was well for him that he could thus find enjoyment&#xD;
in contemplating the balance-sheet of the firm of " John Spencer&#xD;
&amp;amp; Son," for he certainly derived none from the society of his&#xD;
wife. True, she had brought him a fortune, but she was a sad&#xD;
vixen; and as she sat in that chamber of death, holding her in-&#xD;
fant daughter, it was evident that certain financial calculations&#xD;
as to the future had full possession of her mental faculties.&#xD;
There was one at the sufferer's bedside, however, watching&#xD;
with tender care. No tears glistened in her watch-worn eyes,&#xD;
for Martha Gray's heart was too full to weep, as her mind re-&#xD;
called twenty years of honest servitude withhim who now lay&#xD;
before her. She thought of the day when he ad -brought her-&#xD;
from the Westchester poorhouse to be the only attendant on&#xD;
himself and his bride,-the time when his household goods were&#xD;
naught but the simple furniture now around her. Then she&#xD;
thought of Mrs. Spencer's death-of the two sons she left-of&#xD;
the constant efforts of Master John to ingratiate himself with&#xD;
papa at the expense of Master Herbert--of the refusal of the&#xD;
latter to adopt any profession, save that of a landscape painter&#xD;
-r-and then, ever intruding itself, came the thought that the old&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WEST POINT CADET.                 5&#xD;
gentleman had but a few hours to live. Harsh and severe as he&#xD;
hadbeen, she loved him, and her heart was full of the echoes of,&#xD;
sulky replies that she had given him. What would have been&#xD;
her joy to have felt that she was to have new opportunities of&#xD;
service and obedience, and trials of her patience and gratitude&#xD;
for.him who lay there before her, gasping for breath!&#xD;
The sound of the Christmas chimes appeared to arouse him,&#xD;
and his eyes kept glancing toward the door, with an expression&#xD;
of expectation. At last be made a sign to Martha Gray, who&#xD;
raised hjm in her arms, and propped him up with pillows. His&#xD;
thin, asify lips opened.&#xD;
"John," he feebly called.&#xD;
"Here I am, sir," said the son, stopping his walk and ap-&#xD;
proaching the bedside.&#xD;
"Your brother Clement ?"&#xD;
"I suppose he is yet in Paris, sir, although I wrote him in&#xD;
August that you was ill, and wished him to return."&#xD;
For some moments the dying man remained silent, with his&#xD;
eyes closed, and the son resumed his walk. But his steps were&#xD;
soon arrested by the voice of his father, who appeared to have&#xD;
rallied all the expiring energies of his body and mind for a last&#xD;
effort.&#xD;
"John," said -he, "I fear you have made me misjudge your&#xD;
brother. But now promise me that you will, be liberal to him,&#xD;
and that even if he does not come up to the terms of my last&#xD;
will, you "will let him have enough; there is enough for both.&#xD;
Martha Gray, too-poor Martha Gray ! Let her be made&#xD;
com-',&#xD;
But here his voice faltered. He had. already entered the dark&#xD;
valley of the shadow of death, and sank back, pale and breathless.&#xD;
Martha; took his band; it was cold and clammy, but he gave a&#xD;
gentle pressure, and the pupils of his sunken eyes seemed to&#xD;
dilate as he fixed them on her.&#xD;
" Clement-take care of Clement!" he murmured with diffi-&#xD;
culty. - A slight convulsion passed over his rigid features, and&#xD;
all that was mortal of the millionaire was hushed in eterna&amp;amp;l&#xD;
8leep,&#xD;
Bursting into tears, Martha Gray knelt at the bedside, but ere&#xD;
she had proceeded far in her fervent prayer for the peace of the&#xD;
soul just departed, the harsh voice of the systematic man of&#xD;
business grated upon her ear'.&#xD;
" You can remain~ with tlhe body, Martha, until the under-&#xD;

takers come. Now, my dear wife, let us go to tea." And Mr.&#xD;
John Spencer-junior no longer-left the solemn chamber of&#xD;
death, accompanied by his wife, and their youngest child, a&#xD;
daughter. She alone, poor child, who had never seen death-&#xD;
before, wept bitterly.&#xD;
"Don't cry, sissy," said Jher mother, as they left the room.&#xD;
"You can play as loud as you please now, and I shall get you&#xD;
such nice black silk dresses."&#xD;
"1No extravagance !" growled John, Spencer. But he con-,&#xD;
tinued: "I suppose that a great funeral will be expected,,&#xD;
though.".&#xD;
The sun had not risen the next morning, when a young man&#xD;
leaped ashore from the skiff of a pilot-boat at Whitehall landing,&#xD;
andl hastened to the Spencer house, pale, breathless, speechless.-&#xD;
It was 'the youngest son Clement. A glance at the closed&#xD;
blinds of thb house told him all, and it was with a convuLsive&#xD;
shudder that he grasped the crape-enveloped knocker.&#xD;
"Too late! too late !" exclaimed Martha Gray, as she opened&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
Her words fell like the clods upon a coffin as they reached&#xD;
the young wanderer'sheart. Mechanically he followed her up&#xD;
stairs, and there, in that well-remembered chamber, lay his&#xD;
father. No! it was but his father's corpse, covered with a sheet&#xD;
which marked its outline.&#xD;
Reverentially uncovering the face, Clement Spencer gazed&#xD;
upon the well-known liheaments, and pressed his lips to that&#xD;
compressed forehead from whence the disembodied spirit had&#xD;
ascended to judgment. Alas.! those familiar features were&#xD;
settled in the calm repose of death, and bitterly did the young&#xD;
man reproach himself that he had been absent, although he had&#xD;
immediately left Paris on receiving a letter from his brother&#xD;
John (dated in September), stating that the health of their&#xD;
father Was not very good.&#xD;
A footstep aroused him; it was his brother, evidently not in&#xD;
the best of humor.&#xD;
" Why Clem," he petulantly exclaimed, " what was the use of&#xD;
rushing in and tearing up stairs so ? You almost frightened&#xD;
Mrs. Spencer. into a fit. We haven't hiad much sleep of late,&#xD;
either.n&#xD;
" When did our poor' father die ?" asked the sorrow-stricken&#xD;
"'Last night. Hie wasn't so very poor, though; but I'll tell&#xD;
&#xD;
I -~&#xD;
&#xD;
you at once, you don't get much of it.' He -had to work too&#xD;
hard for his money to leave much for you to spend."&#xD;
Cfement gazed at his brother through his' tears with a look of&#xD;
mingled astonishment and anger. But he at once subdued- the'&#xD;
latter passion, saying:&#xD;
" For the sake of him' who lies before us, brother John, d6&#xD;
not thus insult his remains. I ask not his money-nay, I will&#xD;
not even burthen you with my presence after his bodyhas been&#xD;
laid in the dust. Until then, I beg you not. to wound my&#xD;
feelings."&#xD;
John Spencer muttered something which sounded like ",Soft&#xD;
soap!" then replied aloud:&#xD;
" Very well! You'll learn soon enough how things stand.&#xD;
Meanwhile, your old sky-parlor is ready, forI expected you'&#xD;
yesterday. The vessel you came in was reported nearly a week&#xD;
ago by one which, left Havre the next day, and brought her&#xD;
passenger list."&#xD;
"Did father know that I was coming ?"&#xD;
"Yes!" boldly answered Mri..John Spencer, going to the&#xD;
window and gazing through the half-closed blinds into'the&#xD;
street.&#xD;
"And I was only a few hours too late!P" exclaimed Clement;&#xD;
in an agonized tone. Then, taking a fond look at the departed,&#xD;
he reverentially re-covered the face, and went up to his old&#xD;
room. Everything there reminded him of his lost parent-that&#xD;
austere man, whose ambitious desire to make his youngest son&#xD;
a lawyer had been disappointed, yet who was too indulgent to&#xD;
thwart the young man's inclination.&#xD;
"No, Clem-you were not expected," said a well-remembered&#xD;
voice, and looking around, he saw Martliartxray.&#xD;
"My dear old- nurse," he exclaimed, " ho *"glad I am to see&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"And I to see you," replied the honest danie. "But sit down,&#xD;
for I have much to tell you."&#xD;
So she told him of her father's last'illness-of the deathbed&#xD;
conversation, and of his brother's duplicity. He- listened in&#xD;
amazement, and the recital, while it arrested the falling tears,&#xD;
made his brow writhe with anguish. The fact that niammon-&#xD;
had enticed his brother, the companion of his youth, and made&#xD;
him a plotting' foe; seemed a strange and agonizing thought,&#xD;
which, like a fearful spectre,'almost s110ok his faith.&#xD;
" Never mind, Clem," said the old lady ; " I have three thou.&#xD;

sand dollars in the savings' bank, and half of it shall be yours.&#xD;
It all came from your father."&#xD;
"Thanks-thanks !" replied the young man. "I shall not&#xD;
require your hard earnings, though, for I have enough of the&#xD;
liberal sum given me by my father when I went abroad to supply&#xD;
present wants, and I have an art, dear nurse, that will support&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Three days passed slowly along, during which time Clement&#xD;
Spencer took his meals in his room, and saw n6 one of his&#xD;
brother's family, except his sadl-hearted little niece and Martha&#xD;
Gray. Then came the funeral, with all the -pomp that wealth&#xD;
could purchase, and the next morning a servant was directed&#xD;
to invite Mr. Clement Spencer into the library, "to hear the&#xD;
will read."&#xD;
Please, sir, he's gone."&#xD;
"What!I" exclaimed the new master of the house.&#xD;
"He went away early this morning, sir, and told the hack-&#xD;
driver to take him to the, mail-stage office, in Courtland-street.''"&#xD;
It- was even so. The disinherited had- gone forth, aniost beg-&#xD;
gared, a fresh recruit for the great battle of life. - John Spencer,&#xD;
left in the undisturbed possession of his father's wealth, was on&#xD;
tha summit of fortune's wheel.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II-&#xD;
&#xD;
A CHRISTMAS GIFT.&#xD;
&#xD;
TEN years-long, long -years-had passed away since the time&#xD;
chronicled in the preceding chapter, and the shrill winds were&#xD;
whistling Christmas chimes for the first time in the then infant&#xD;
village of Coalboro', in the interior of Pennsylvania. Never&#xD;
before had the withered leaves of winter been checked by human&#xD;
habitations, as they were whirled throughthat picturesque dale,&#xD;
ahd they now appeared to give mystic Delphian utterances ere&#xD;
they reached the ground. Not merely announcing the presence&#xD;
of winter, but rustling welcomes to the busy communities who&#xD;
were peopling the hitherto deserted solitude, and-beginning to&#xD;
extract from beneath its sterile soil '" black 'diamonds," which&#xD;
would set the frost-king at defiance. The cold blasts might&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
sweep In mad fury over the plains, or eddy through the streets,&#xD;
or moan through. the forests, yet those who could enjoy the&#xD;
genial warmth emitted by glowing anthracite from the newly-&#xD;
opened mines at Coalboro', cared not for the frozen temperature&#xD;
without.&#xD;
The mines had not been long worked, and the village was- as&#xD;
yet in an incipient state, with many a stump in newly laid out&#xD;
streets. Log huts had been hastily erected for the families of&#xD;
the miners, and scattered over the town were a score or so of&#xD;
dwellings with more pretension to elegance and comfort. Prom-&#xD;
inent among these was a cottage, the very model of rural ele-&#xD;
gance, which was on the main avenue. It was shaded by many&#xD;
stalwart oaks, relics of the original forest, and over. its rustic:&#xD;
porch the gorgeous woodbine 'hung in heavy masses, relieved"&#xD;
by the graceful tendrils of the clematis.&#xD;
It was theshome of Clement Spencer, he who was left at the&#xD;
bottom of fortune's wheel at the death of his father, and who&#xD;
must be personally introduced ere the reader is informed- how&#xD;
the decade has been passed. The clock--was striking eight as he&#xD;
entered his house, having been to the post-office, and bought&#xD;
from there. the budget of letters and newspapers just received&#xD;
by the weekly mail.&#xD;
He was a tall, well-formed man, that Mr. Clement Spencer,&#xD;
.strongly built, and broad across the chest, yet in nowise clumsy.&#xD;
His cheeks were thin, his dark hazel eyes somewhat sunken, his&#xD;
hair grizzled with time's snow traces, and his high temples&#xD;
were indicative of great decision - of character. Yet an ex-&#xD;
pression of subdued content played around his full lips, and his&#xD;
natural flow of animal spirits ever gushed forth from his true&#xD;
heart, like the clear sparkling current, of an artesian well.&#xD;
Stamped was he, in nature's mint, as one of her noblemen, that&#xD;
class. represented in the old Spanish pictures, with " gentleman "&#xD;
indelibly written on. every lineament, and great aspirations&#xD;
enthroned upon each lofty brow.&#xD;
Checkered had been his life since he wwnt forth from his&#xD;
desolate home, to seek fame and fortune. Perilous is the career&#xD;
of a young artist, who has but his own genius to aid him, as he&#xD;
seeks " patronage."~ Luckily for the young, adventurer, he not&#xD;
only possessed artistic ability, but a latent fund of good humor,&#xD;
and a sauvity of manner well calculated to please the frank. peo-&#xD;
ple of the West. His portraits were soon regarded as superior&#xD;

&#xD;
to those of any other artist west of the Alleghanies, and wherever&#xD;
-he opened a studio,-sitters came in crowds.&#xD;
He thus acquired fame and fortune, but no notice was taken&#xD;
of him by his brother John, who was now one of the millionaires&#xD;
-of New York. The name of John Spencer was,-recognized- as&#xD;
giving the value of coin to any note which bore it, and proudly&#xD;
did it figure upon many a subscription list; yet never a copper&#xD;
did the individual' who bore it bestow upon a poor blind man&#xD;
who crouched daily beside his office door. -His narrow mind&#xD;
had been narrowed yet further by the success which had fol-&#xD;
lowed his business operations, and his pet objects of thought&#xD;
seemed to be calculations as to how much his wife could spend,&#xD;
and how little a clerk could"live upon without becoming dis-&#xD;
honest.. Little cared he what had become of the brother whom&#xD;
he had let go forth almost penniless, and, if the truth must be&#xD;
told, he was as little cared for in return..&#xD;
It was not until the young painter had won-both fme aid&#xD;
fortune by steady toil, that an accident changed the 'whole&#xD;
tenor of'his life. He was journeying from Ohio to Washington&#xD;
city (where he had several commissions), as all true lovers of&#xD;
nature journey-on foot. This enabled him to epjoy-pany a&#xD;
panorama of varied landscape, and at the same time to pursue&#xD;
his researches in geology, to which he had given much atten-&#xD;
tion. Pleasant was it to investigate the wrecks of worlds, and&#xD;
Ilad in inanimate nature new proofs of the sacred truth of the&#xD;
Inspired word.&#xD;
One pleasant summer afternoon, as the yonng artist was -thus&#xD;
leisurely sauntering across the Alleghanies through an un-&#xD;
trodden wilderness, he sat down to rest upon' the precipitous&#xD;
bank of a brawling mountain torrent. A recent storm had so&#xD;
swollen the current that a-portion of the bank had been swept&#xD;
away; and as-Clement Spencer gazed at the- newly-developed&#xD;
strata with a half-abstracted glance, a sudden thought took&#xD;
possession of his very soul. -His cheeks glowed, and an un-&#xD;
natural light gleaned froni his-eyes, as he carefully examined&#xD;
the long-hidden, though now uncovered mineral. Yew! he had&#xD;
discovered what had been so anxiously sought on the western&#xD;
hemisphere--coal. -&#xD;
Carrying some of the precious substance to Philadelphia, he&#xD;
found it what he supposed, nor was it long ere he had (partly&#xD;
by the ssistance of wealthy western friends)~ purchased the&#xD;
valuable tract of land. A company was then organized, to*&#xD;
&#xD;
.4&#xD;
&#xD;
IC&#xD;
&#xD;
which he in turn sold, reserving a controlling right, and acting&#xD;
as agent. Then came a trial. There was a doubt as- to the&#xD;
practical value of the "anthracite," so different was it from the&#xD;
"bituminous " coal exclusively used. Notable professors de-&#xD;
clared it useless, and wits made it the object of their ridicule,&#xD;
while croakers shook their heads as they spoke of the "Coal-&#xD;
boro' Mining Company." What little stock had. been taken&#xD;
could have been purchased from-the holders at a song.&#xD;
But Clement Spencer was not to be daunted. Packing up&#xD;
his painting materials, he entered into the mining operations&#xD;
.with heart and soul, determined to overcome every obstacle.&#xD;
There was, perhaps, a shade of anxiety on his features, bit he&#xD;
grappled with the great question, and never rested until he had&#xD;
achieved the object of his ambition. Coal from the Coalboro'&#xD;
mine was- triumphantly popular at last. Clement's friends&#xD;
exulted, his detractors held their peace.&#xD;
It was at this proud period of his history that he entered his&#xD;
house on the Christmas eve of eighteen hundred and twenty-&#xD;
five. We have spoken of the pleasant external appearance of&#xD;
the cottage, but that was eclipsed by the luxifious comfort&#xD;
which reigned within. Cosy rooms, a few good pictures, a well&#xD;
selected library, and a fine bathing establishment, showed that&#xD;
the owner, when abroad, had learned that life is something&#xD;
more than a mere animal existence. One room alone was&#xD;
plainly furnished; it was the sleeping chamber of Clement&#xD;
Spencer, and the furniture was that previously described as&#xD;
having been cherished by his father. A cunning dealer had&#xD;
found no difficulty in obtaining it in exchange for a new yet&#xD;
more modern set, from Mrs. John Spencer, and the only' orna-&#xD;
ment in the room which it graced was a heavy gilt frame, in&#xD;
which was set- a window sash composed of one large pane of&#xD;
glass. To this, the picturesque external landscape, wild and&#xD;
craggy, supplied an exquisite picture, ever changing with the&#xD;
seasons, never -the same.&#xD;
Nor was this pleasant abode without a presiding mistress. It&#xD;
-had been Clement Spencer's first care, after acquiring means of&#xD;
support, to seek out Martha Gray. She had not remained in&#xD;
his brother's service, and needed but little persuasion to go and&#xD;
share' the fortunes of " Master Clem," over whom she thence-&#xD;
forth watched like a mother. Past the meridian of beauty-life,&#xD;
no one would have called the old dame .good-looking, yet the.&#xD;
serene expression of her countenance was very dear to the&#xD;

&#xD;
object of her care. To an almost childlike simplicity and sin-&#xD;
gleness of heart, she united a dignity of thought and a just con-&#xD;
ception of character, that made her a fit companion for the&#xD;
young wrestler with fate.&#xD;
There she sat, in her plain black bombazine dress and snow-&#xD;
White cap, busy with her knitting. Every household futy had&#xD;
been attended to, and she was ready to converse with her, wor-&#xD;
shipped "Master Clem," or to keep silent if he was-as was&#xD;
often the case-absorbed in his own thoughts.&#xD;
"Do you know what night this is ?" he asked,,as he sat down&#xD;
o read the letters and papers which he had just brought from&#xD;
the post-office.I&#xD;
"Can I forget ?" replied she, with a sigh. "How fast the ten&#xD;
years have sped, and 0 how much we have to be grateful for !"&#xD;
Mr. Spencer made no reply, for he was spell-bound by a letter&#xD;
which he had just opened. It was brief, and he soon laid it&#xD;
down, then took it up and re-read it.&#xD;
"Nothing wrong about the coal, I trust ?" exclaimed Martha&#xD;
Gray, who saw that some startling, tidings were in the letter.&#xD;
"No, no !" replied Mr. Spencer. "This letter, Martha, is from&#xD;
-it is from my brother John."&#xD;
"John Spencer !" ejaculated the good dame. "Has he really&#xD;
written you ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Let me read you his letter." And he read:&#xD;
"New York, December 20th, 1825.&#xD;
"Dip. BRo.,-Am glad to hear yr. coal well spoken of. Gan&#xD;
you let me have fifty (50) shs. stock at say eigthty (80) dols.?&#xD;
If so I will take it., Please advise without delay. Yrs. truly,&#xD;

the house. Now only five years old, so cannot say.  J. S.&#xD;
"CLEM. SPENCER, Esq."&#xD;
&#xD;
"A strange letter,"-said Martha Gray, in&#xD;
having kept silence for ten years. Really&#xD;
wonders, if it can thaw out such a heart."&#xD;
"Be charitable-be charitable!" replied&#xD;
it was evident from his manner that he was&#xD;
-an opinion strengthened by the letter of&#xD;
his New York agent, who requested ten&#xD;

wheel. Yet who would this wealth profit when the wild winds&#xD;
sang a requiem over his grave-?&#xD;
His reverie, and a doze of the good- housekeeper, were sud-&#xD;
denly interrupted by a loud, nervous clangingO'of the knocker&#xD;
on the front door, which brought them both to their feet.&#xD;
"What can the matter be ?" asked Martha Gray, as Mr. Spen-&#xD;
cer, taking a candle, went to the door. As he opened it, the&#xD;
wind extinguished the light, leaving everything both within&#xD;
and without in darkness.&#xD;
"Who's there ?" he. called out.&#xD;
There was no reply, and he was about to-, close the door,&#xD;
thinking that the alarm was an idle holiday prank, when the&#xD;
faint wail of an infant apparently just awakened, met his ear.&#xD;
Guided by the cry, he found a small basket placed upon his&#xD;
door-stone, and- as he brought it into the lighted room, it was&#xD;
evident that the vehement vociferation came from a very small&#xD;
pattern of humanity, carefully wrapped in a blanket.&#xD;
"Dear me !" exclaimed~ Martha Gray, pulling every needle&#xD;
from her knitting. "Why it's -a baby! What can we do with&#xD;
it ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Cherish and&#xD;
&#xD;
protect it," was Mr. Spencer's laconic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
&#xD;
NEW ACQUAINTANCES.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE unheralded advent of an unticketed specimen of hu-&#xD;
manity produced, as- might have been expected, no small com-&#xD;
motion, in the house of Mr. Spencer, and the inmittes of his&#xD;
kitchen, who had also heard, the knock, crowded around the&#xD;
table on which the basket had been deposited. Indignant as&#xD;
the bld housekeeper was, tears came into her' eyes as she took&#xD;
the little foundling from its resting-place, and endeavored to'&#xD;
silence its loud cries. The appealing innocence of the unsullied&#xD;
waif thus cast upon the stormy sea of life, without a protector,&#xD;
was irresistible.&#xD;
Mr. Spencer, meanwhile, was searching among the contents&#xD;
of the basket for some clue to the child's identity. Nor was he&#xD;

unsuccessful, for beneath tie small pillow was a packet, and,&#xD;
strange to say, it was addressed to himself.-&#xD;
Poor thing " said Martha Gray, as she paced up and down&#xD;
the room with the still sobbing .infant. "Who can be its&#xD;
mother ,"&#xD;
"That's not the question now," responded Mr. Spencer.&#xD;
Rather ask who will take care of it ?" And as he spqke, he&#xD;
slipped the package into one of: his pockets, unseen by any of&#xD;
the astonished -group, who were all gazing at the stranger.&#xD;
W Let me see, said the housekeeper, continuigng her walk.&#xD;
0, 1 have it! You know, sir, that tall Welch miner who lives&#xD;
in the log cabin next the Methodist church ?"&#xD;
What! Meredith Egan ? A sad drunken fellow he is."&#xD;
That's true, sir. But his wife:is as good as he is good for&#xD;
nothing. Their child was buried to-day; it was about the age&#xD;
of this one, and I am sure that she will be glad to. come here as&#xD;
nurse."&#xD;
Go for her at once, Hugh," said Mr. Spencer, to his faithful&#xD;
Irish gardener. And when the man left, he retired to his study,&#xD;
leaving orders to be called the moment that Mrs. Eagan arrived.&#xD;
Locking the door of his retreat behind him, he carefully ex-&#xD;
amined the contents of the package; then as carefully put it&#xD;
away, and no one was the wiser for what information he&#xD;
obtained.                            '&#xD;
Mrs. Eagan, poor woman, was delighted at the situation&#xD;
offered, and was immediately installed up stairs with the babe,&#xD;
giving rise to a deal of gossip in Coalboro' the next day.&#xD;
Neither was the scandal- diminished when, on the next Sabbath&#xD;
morning, the infant was presented at the Episcopal church for&#xD;
baptism, and named after its godfather, " Clement Spencer."&#xD;
No-one dared to hint that the child had thus been adopted by&#xD;
its own father, for Mr. Spencer's character was far above suspi-&#xD;
cion.. Yet Many shook their heads knowingly, as they insinu-&#xD;
ated that he must have more knowledge of the little one's&#xD;
parentage than he chose to impart.&#xD;
Whether this was the case or not, the Warm affections which&#xD;
had for years been pent up in Mr. Spencer's heart, now gushed&#xD;
forth in copious streams, and his " godson," as he termed the&#xD;
Child, received his loving care. The vexations of business were&#xD;
everforgotten by the millionaire mine-owner when he sportedI&#xD;
with the child, and the. shade which deep thought had cast over&#xD;
his brow was dissipated. by the gratified snlile with which. he.&#xD;
&#xD;
gazed upon his protege. Neither did the infant fail to recipro-&#xD;
Cate this fondness, ere fairly conscious of existence, for it would&#xD;
lift its tiny hands towards him whenever he approached, with&#xD;
a cry of delight.&#xD;
Sothe boy grew up, carefully trained by his godfather and by&#xD;
Martha Gray; nor was there a finer youth in Coalboro' than&#xD;
young Clemg Spencer. Handsome, a quick student, and truth-&#xD;
ful as the sun, he continued to endear himself to all who knew&#xD;
11im, The girls taught, him to sing, an old French emigrant&#xD;
instructed him in the language of that sunny land, and his god-&#xD;
father was equally anxious to have him attend good schools,&#xD;
and also take such out-of-doorexercise as would- give him an&#xD;
athletic frame and matily habits. A-"sound body," he wisely&#xD;
considered, is necessary to a "sound mind.",&#xD;
wAll this time, Mr, Spencer had never seen any member of his&#xD;
brother's family, for he had no disposition to renew amicable&#xD;
relations with the destroyer of his early happiness. Yet on the&#xD;
tenth anniversary of. Clement's advent-aChristmnas night, two&#xD;
strangers were deposited at Mr. Spencer's door by the stage-&#xD;
coach. One was a gaunt, tall individual, shabbily clad, with&#xD;
large hands and feet, small, suspicious gray eyes, thick protu-&#xD;
berant lips, and a sanctimonious east of countenance.&#xD;
"Have I the honor of addressing Mr.~Spencer ?" he asked, as&#xD;
that-gentleman presented himself.&#xD;
" That is my name, sir."&#xD;
"Let me introduce your nephew, sir, John Spencer, Jr., I&#xD;
am Ichabod Pike, now travelling with him."&#xD;
Mr. Spencer looked at the young, man with an ;expression&#xD;
anything but pleasant, nor was it softened by the appearance .of&#xD;
any pleasing- characteristic. He could not be over fifteen, yet&#xD;
there was already a sullen, satiated cloud over his common-&#xD;
place features, his eyes had no expression, and he seemed bent&#xD;
on switching some specks of mud from his highly polished boots&#xD;
with a flexible whalebone cane. His attire was unexception-&#xD;
ble both as to fashion and material, making him an incarna-&#xD;
tio of the " fashion plates " in a tailor's window.&#xD;
What could Mr. Spencer do ? There they were, with trunks&#xD;
and hat-boxes. it. was nine o'clock at night, besides being&#xD;
Chi-istmas eve. Besides, the youngster was his kinsman; he&#xD;
Jhad never wronged him; so he invited them into the house.&#xD;
They remained there a week, during which time the young&#xD;
New Yorker endeavored to instil love of city pleas ures into the&#xD;

unsophisticated mind of young Clement.. At times, too, he&#xD;
would endeavor to extract some information from him as to his&#xD;
godfather's " property, or his own parentage. But on neither&#xD;
subject was tht boy-communicative, for the very best reason in&#xD;
the world-he -new nothing to tell.&#xD;
Mr. Spencer was equally'bored by the inquisitiveness of Pro-&#xD;

questions as to Master Clement's origin. All of these questions&#xD;
were answered evasively, at first with good humor, and then&#xD;
with such brevity that it was evident Mr. Spencer had no desire&#xD;
to be'Interrogated on the subject.&#xD;
Equally unsuccessful was the sturdy questioner in his attempt&#xD;
to probe this hidden history among the people of Coalboro'.&#xD;
He could find but few who were residents of the place when&#xD;
the babe was first introduced into Mr. Spencer's family, and&#xD;
none- of them could tell, as much as we have related. So the&#xD;
mystery which th visitors had come to unravel remained&#xD;
hidden, and they ixes-e none the wiSer.&#xD;
- They left with many expressions of profuse thanks for the&#xD;
hospitality shown them, and hopes that their host woulli soon&#xD;
return the visit. The idea appeared -to strike Mr. Spencer&#xD;
rather favorably, for he. felt that he was advancing in years, and&#xD;
time had worn off all of the bitterness which he had felt toward&#xD;
his brother, although a deep sense of wrong endured remained.&#xD;
He. was glad that his nephew had thus broken the ice; yet he&#xD;
was also glad that he had not remained longer. It was of no&#xD;
benefit to Clement, who had all the ingenuous-frankness of a&#xD;
country lad, to associate with the young New Yorker, who&#xD;
talked but of trotting horses, dress and billiards.&#xD;
Martha Gray, good woman, did *not hesitate to express her&#xD;
joy at their departure. Every recollection connected with&#xD;
young Spencer's father was painful -to her, and she could not&#xD;
see the son without a mixture of repugnance and dislike which&#xD;
she found it almost impossible to conceal.'&#xD;
Clement Spencer seized the first opportunity, after they had&#xD;
gone, to have an interview with Martha, asking her:&#xD;
" What did John Spencer mean by asking me about my&#xD;
parents ? I have never thought about them myself." -&#xD;
" Nor have you had any -reason to, my dear boy, for is not&#xD;
-Mr. Spencer all that any parent could be to youi?'' replied the&#xD;
good dame.         -&#xD;
" Yes, yes! But he is after all only my godfather."  -&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
Martha Gray made no answer, and then was It, for the first&#xD;
timb, that a suspicion flashed across his mind.&#xD;
"Tell me," he exclaimed, "- am I his son ? Is there a cloud&#xD;
over my birth?"&#xD;
" I cannot really tell you," was the equivocal reply.&#xD;
But my mother ?"&#xD;
"Indeed I do not know."&#xD;
"What! Am I-can I be the child of shame ?" said Clement,&#xD;
with a sudden sinking of his heart, and utter revulsion of his&#xD;
whole frame. Then with a sad heart he turned away, feeling&#xD;
that he, whose dawn of life had been apparently so fair, was&#xD;
after all doomed to remain under a cloud of obloquy. Tears&#xD;
would escape from his full eyes, and he sought his favorite walk&#xD;
on the river bank, where he could compose his thoughts.&#xD;
It so happened that a continuous thaw, whichihad lasted over&#xD;
a week, .had melted the snows in the mountain gorges, and the&#xD;
river had far exceeded its usual bounds, The swollen current,&#xD;
as it dashed madly along, carrying with it uprooted trees, was&#xD;
in accordance with the young man's feelings. But on turning&#xD;
around a point which commanded a view of the bridge, he for-&#xD;
got his own troubles. on seeing the danger in which another&#xD;
was placed..&#xD;
A stranger, whose dress showed that he was a gentleman,&#xD;
stood about the centre of this frail structure, holding his horse&#xD;
by the bridle. It was evident that after he had ventured on, the&#xD;
span over which he had first passed had given way before the&#xD;
volume of water, and now the further pier swayed to and fro in&#xD;
the angry current. Retreat was cut off; to. advance was im-&#xD;
possible, and while Clement looked there was a crash. Another&#xD;
moment, and the entire mass of timber came loom-ing down the&#xD;
surging tide, dissolving as it came along. The horse struck out&#xD;
for the shore, but the man, who evidently could not swim, uttered&#xD;
a cry of despair and anguish as he clung to a large timber.&#xD;
Clement, who was a good swimmer, did not hesitate, but&#xD;
plunged into the water, regardless of its raging force and the&#xD;
sharp cold. He hoped to reach the stick of timber to'wvhich the&#xD;
man clung convulsively, shrieking piteously for help, and at-last&#xD;
succeeded. Grasping him around the waist with one arm, and&#xD;
with the other seizing the stick of timber, he endeavored to head&#xD;
it towards the shore. But it was no easy task, for his thick&#xD;
clothing had absorbed so much water as to weigh down his&#xD;
limbs like lead. -On they went, and rapidly approached the falls.&#xD;

THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;
The noise of the roaring torrent fell like a koell upon the lad's&#xD;
ear, for he feared that they would be carried over the rocky&#xD;
precipice. Glaring round, in inexpressible dismay, he saw little&#xD;
chance of extrication from the frightful peril in which he was&#xD;
involved. There was a crowd on the bank, but they could not&#xD;
aid him, and some cried frantically to him to save himself. But-&#xD;
he heroically persevered, and at last, not fifty feet above the falls,&#xD;
the stick of timber was so near the bank that some men waded,&#xD;
in, holding to each other, and caught it. A loud shout of triumph&#xD;
heralded the rescue of the two, and Clement-sank insensible into-&#xD;
the arms of his godfather, who stood in agony upon the river&#xD;
bank,&#xD;
Both the preserver and the preserved were taken to Mr.&#xD;
Spencer's'house, where Martha Gray kindled up the blazing&#xD;
fires, and concocted a steaming beverage, which soon restored&#xD;
warmth and vigor to the chilled and benumbed limbs of the&#xD;
drenched ones.&#xD;
"Clem," said Mr. Spencer, "I have been to carry a change of&#xD;
clothes to the gentleman whose life you have so- nobly saved- It&#xD;
is no less a personage than the Honorable Mr. Ledroit, who has&#xD;
just been elected senator from Louisiana, and who is as noted a&#xD;
geologist as he is a j urist-'&#xD;
"And who, waiving all ceremony," interrupted a melodious.&#xD;
voice, "now comes to thank his deliverer."&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
DISAPPOINTMENT AND APPOINTMENT-&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was bitter cold, that January night on which Prefessor&#xD;
Pike returned with young John Spencer to the paternal roof.&#xD;
The windrose as the shades of night gathered over the commer-&#xD;
cial metropolis, and shrill blasts howled among the tall chim- .&#xD;
neys, like angry demons chanting a wail. Capitalists who had&#xD;
nothing on earth or in heaven to care for but their coffers, drew&#xD;
up their arm-chairs.closer to the blazing fires, and dreamed of&#xD;
their ill-gotten wealth; while the industrious working-classes,&#xD;
e gathered around their stoves, rehearsed the toils of the day past.&#xD;
Even the promenades on Broadway hastened along,,is if anx-&#xD;
ions to reach shelter'from the blast, or looked longingly dowa&#xD;

into restaurants, which seemed so comfortable. But the severe&#xD;
cold was most- cruelly felt. in those vice-haunted regions where&#xD;
vice revelled undisturbed and drunkenness caroused undis-&#xD;
turbed. There, haggard with misery, and crouched together&#xD;
-with shivering closeness to keep the sharp-cutting night-wind&#xD;
from freezing up the very pulses of their hearts, human beings&#xD;
writhed in misery, anxious for death to call them home. Yet&#xD;
the night-wid howled on.&#xD;
But the wrathYul tones of that night-wind were eclipsed by&#xD;
the freezing, vengeful reception given by old John Spencer to&#xD;
his returned son and the inquisitive professor.&#xD;
"So," he growled out as they entered the sitting-room, "where&#xD;
from"&#xD;
Coalboro', sir," replied Professor Pike, who saw at once&#xD;
that his patron was excited, and hoped to divert his wrath&#xD;
"1Coalboro' 1" thundered John Spencer. "Why, you left there&#xD;
a week ago. Where-have you been?"&#xD;
"The roads are almost impassable, sir, and we were forced to&#xD;
come -by the way of Newburgh. There we found the river&#xD;
frozen up, and have consequently been delayed longer than we&#xD;
had hoped to be!"&#xD;
"You did what I sent you for ?"&#xD;
"Really, sir," replied Professor Pike, in an obsequious tone,&#xD;
" you have no idea-of the industry with which we labored to&#xD;
accomplish your wishes, but really the veil of mystery is so'&#xD;
closely pinned down, if I may use the expression, that-"&#xD;
As he spoke, Mr. Spencer's brow contracted, and. his lips&#xD;
twitched nervously.. At last he lost all patience, and interrupted&#xD;
with&#xD;
"Well, why did you not -tear it away? Mystery fiddlestick!&#xD;
Of course you saw the boy ??"&#xD;
" Yes,-sir."&#xD;
"And what sort of a looking brat is he ?"&#xD;
"Why, sir, he is a pretty good-looking lad."&#xD;
"A confounded prig, father," chimed in John .Spencer, Jr.&#xD;
" You never saw such a Miss Nancy, and he has Uncle Clement&#xD;
under his thumb. Mighty sinall chance for me there, I tell you."&#xD;
" What !" said the irritated father; "my brother leave his&#xD;
fortune to a brat left at his door like a loaf o'f bread !" An un-&#xD;
definable expression of malignant hatred passed over his cdun;&#xD;
tenance as lhe spoke; and when he had concluded, he ground his&#xD;
teeth with rage.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Your brother is. very fond of the boy," humbly remarked&#xD;
Professor Pike, "aid really there is a strong famil likeness.&#xD;
Can it be his own child ?"&#xD;
"No!" angrily replied the elder Spencer; "at least I cannot&#xD;
think so-we must not think so. But has he no servants who&#xD;
can be bribed? was there no one who could give any informa-+&#xD;
tion on the subject ?"&#xD;
"I think, sir," replied the professor, ".that an old 'housekeeper&#xD;
may, know, but--"&#xD;
" But mum's the word there," interrupted young John. "I&#xD;
asked one day if Master Clem resembled his mother. Said she,&#xD;
iw a surly tone, 'I hope, young man, you don't resemble your&#xD;
father.'"&#xD;
"Does she know me ?" asked the elder Spencer.&#xD;
"Thit she does," answered young John; " and she has about&#xD;
the, same love for you that a dog has for a hickory switch."&#xD;
"What's her name ?"        '&#xD;
"Martha Gray. She*used to know your father, too."&#xD;
"The old hag, I remember her! *Never mind, John.; we'll&#xD;
look into this matter, and you shall be your uncle's heir."&#xD;
Buttoning up his surtout, the merchant moved towards the&#xD;
door, when his-son advanced towards him, saying:&#xD;
"I am hard up, sir, and as the sleighing is good, will thank&#xD;
you for some funds."&#xD;
"Funds ! Mind your studies."&#xD;
"I study hard, sir, as the professor will tell you." (That wor-&#xD;
thy nodded approvingly.) "But all the young men of our set&#xD;
go out-to Cato's every afternoon when there is good sleighing,&#xD;
and you would not haye it said that John Spencer's son had to&#xD;
take his sleigh-rides in~a Broadway omnibus ?"&#xD;
"Of course not," chimed in the shrill voice of Mrs.. Spencer,.&#xD;
who now entered .the room, dressed in the height.-of fashion.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you back from those horrid coal-mines, and&#xD;
hope ybur father will do as you wish him to. Your son's posi-&#xD;
tida in society, Mr. Spencer, should not be sacrificed for a few&#xD;
dollarss." 4&#xD;
" My son's fiddlestick, madam! If he had only played his ,&#xD;
cards right, he might have had his Uncle Clem's moneyy"&#xD;
" But society, Mr. Spencer. We must let him be on an equality&#xD;
with the young men ourselves." -&#xD;
" Well, well," growled the discomfited merchant, taking out&#xD;
his pocket-book; " here's two hundred dollars, John, in SoutherL.&#xD;
&#xD;
money. Make them    take it at par. I'm going to Tammany&#xD;
fiall, for I find that by getting into the Board of Aldermen,'I&#xD;
can have streets opened through my up-town lots.' Thdt's the&#xD;
' Way, John; always have an eye to business."&#xD;
"Your son is not unmindful of your counsels," said the pro-&#xD;
fessor, as the old gentleman left the room. Then turning to&#xD;
Mrs. Spencer, he continued: "But he profits most by the lady-&#xD;
like manners and high tone of his lady mother.".&#xD;
"Really, professor, you flatter me," languishingly replied&#xD;
Mrs. Spencer, though if she blushed, it did not penetrate' the&#xD;
rouge. "We are more'obliged to you than I can express, for&#xD;
having brought up our son with such aristocratic habits."&#xD;
"And correct moral principles, I trust," added the professor.&#xD;
" Come," said the young man, "let's move."&#xD;
The professor had rooms for himself and his student in a&#xD;
wing of the house, where there was a side door opening on an&#xD;
alley. Nor was it long ere they emerged from there, somewhat&#xD;
disguised, and bent their steps towards a noted gambling es-&#xD;
tablishment near the Park. On their arrival, the young man&#xD;
was consigned to the tender mercies of two cronies of his tutor,&#xD;
and so well did they' do their work,. that in about an hour he&#xD;
came to the table where that worthy was seated, exclaiming:&#xD;
"Let's go. I'm cleaned out."&#xD;
"In a moment," was the professor's bland reply. 'Never&#xD;
mind your bad luck. The stable-men will give you credit, and&#xD;
you know that Cato is delighted to add fresh items to that bill&#xD;
of his. When I've played out this hand, we'll have some whiskey&#xD;
punch and start."&#xD;
While the young scape-grace was thus on the road to ruin at&#xD;
New York, Master Clement Spencer was enjoying the society&#xD;
of the statesmait whom he had rescued from a watery, grave at&#xD;
Coalboro'. Mr. Ledroit was a. man on whose age it-was diffi-&#xD;
cult to determine, for his slender figure might have been bent&#xD;
as it was either by time or infirmity. His thin, curly hair left&#xD;
exposed a high and expansive forehead; his features were quite&#xD;
emaciated, and his tlin 'gps were colorless. His large, dark,&#xD;
melancholy eyes, far sunken beneath overhanging brows,gleanmed&#xD;
-at times like the flashing brilliancy of sunshine upon water, and&#xD;
there was an air of mysterious sadness about'him, as though he&#xD;
was a victim to some hidden sorrow. Yet no one could gaze&#xD;
on his'-wan countenance, or hear his musical voice, and believe&#xD;
the mystery was connected withevil.&#xD;

22              THE WEST POINT CADET-&#xD;
e remained some weeks at Coalboro', visiting the mines, an4&#xD;
traversing the mountains on geological -expeditions, with young&#xD;
Clement Spencer as his constant companion. The lad was evi-&#xD;
dently impressed with his position, and felt that interest in him&#xD;
so natural to a boy brought up in retirement, apart from the&#xD;
bustle of the world, who is thrown into contact with a spirit&#xD;
that has struggled with and mastered its difficulties.  ,,I&#xD;
Mr. Ledroit had travelled far and wide, not merely glancing&#xD;
-at what was on his way, but so closely observing.men-and places&#xD;
that his descriptions possessed the fidelity-of a daguerreotype,&#xD;
with the originality of a crayon sketch. These descriptions&#xD;
-were rare treats to young Clement. It seemed, too, tha the'&#xD;
senator was richly repaid by the lad's original comments on&#xD;
what he told him, or by his happy remarks about the luxuriance&#xD;
of nature around them. At any rate, the two were tgether,&#xD;
from morning until uight, and seemed as devoted, as though&#xD;
theirs had been a life acquaintance.&#xD;
Once only did Mr. Ledroit strike an unhappy-chord on the.-&#xD;
heart-strings which vibrated so pleasantly in unison with the&#xD;
musical tones of his voice.&#xD;
" Clem," said he, as they were striding up a ravine, "I was&#xD;
surprised to learn this morning, while you were at the post-&#xD;
office, that you are not Mr. Spencer's son."&#xD;
Exceedingly distressed, almost beyond the power of self-&#xD;
restraint, the young man turned his eyes, and appealingly asked:&#xD;
"0 , sir, whose son lan I be ?"&#xD;
"How can I answer you? It was by accident that I asked&#xD;
Mr. Spencer this morning how long his wife had been dead. 'I&#xD;
have never been married,' was his reply. 'But is not Clement&#xD;
your son.?' I asked. 'No,' he replied; 'he is my godson.' There&#xD;
the conversation ended, and I regret that I have alluded to it,&#xD;
for Ir see that it gives you pain."&#xD;
"Ah," said Clement, his cheek flushing and his eyes glancing&#xD;
distrustfully, "if I could but answer your question I-should not&#xD;
mind it ! It is but a short time since I learned. the-fact myself&#xD;
that Mr. Spencer is not. a relative, though he acts a father's&#xD;
part. Neither do I wish to question him on the subject, for it&#xD;
is evident that he is not disposed to tell me, probably because it&#xD;
is a bitter truth that he would have to tell."  -.&#xD;
"lNay, nay," replied Mr. Ledroit, " do not think that. There&#xD;

&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
are often circumstances which have to, be concealed,-and depend&#xD;
upon it, Mr. Spencer would not remain silent, were it not fbr&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
HONOR AND DISHONOR.&#xD;
AFTER Mr. Ledroit was-gone, the young man felt sad at heart,&#xD;
and often pondered over the mystery of his parentage until he&#xD;
determined to insist upon an explanation. But when he would&#xD;
find himself alone with Mr. Spencer, his courage would fail him.&#xD;
One evening, as he sat listlessly before the fire, Mr. Spencer,&#xD;
came. with a large packet in his hand.&#xD;
"Ihave important tidings for you, Clem," he said.&#xD;
The lad's heart throbbed wildly, for he fancied that the mys-&#xD;
tery of his life was to be solved, and he gazed eagerly at the&#xD;
package.&#xD;
"It is from Senator Ledroit," continued Mr. Spencer, "and it&#xD;
contains your appointment as a cadet at West Point." -&#xD;
"A cgidet !" exclaimed young Clement, clapping his hands&#xD;
with joy.. "Am I really to be a cadet ?" And all bIs trOubles&#xD;
&#xD;
your good that he should. Meanwhile, what are your prospects&#xD;
in life ?"&#xD;
"  y prospects?"&#xD;
" Yes. Surely, after you risked your life to save mine, I can&#xD;
but take a deep interest in your future welfare, and perhaps I&#xD;
may in some way advance you in the world. Now what, above&#xD;
everything else, 'would you like to be?"&#xD;
"Were it possible, sir, I would like to -go to West Point,"&#xD;
replied the young man.&#xD;
"To West Point! Why you have no idea how hard you '&#xD;
would have to study to getthere."&#xD;
" Nay, sir-- think I could.pass exanminationto-morrow. To&#xD;
be frank, I have for years cherished the hope, and last year had&#xD;
the promise of An appointment from Squire Williamson, who&#xD;
was the member of Congress from this district. But, unluckily&#xD;
for me, he was not re-elected; so I had all my labor for nothing."&#xD;
" Never mind; you may have better luck," was the kind reply.&#xD;
That night, on returning, Mr. Ledioit found an imperative&#xD;
summons to the metropolis, and he took his leave next morning,&#xD;
with manyAkind wishes on both sides.&#xD;

" Yes, my dear Clem; you are to enter West Point, after all.&#xD;
I feel regret at parting from you, but your heart is bent on a&#xD;
soldier's life, and I know you will not disggee the name you&#xD;
bear.".&#xD;
The remaining winter months passed quickly away, and at&#xD;
the commencement of the spring term, Mr. Spencer went with&#xD;
Clemen tto West Point, and rerhained there until the lad-was&#xD;
comfortably installed.&#xD;

&#xD;
West Point-what American heart does not leap with joy and&#xD;
swell with pride at the mere mention of this martial nursery..&#xD;
which is equally famed for national beauties and historical rec-&#xD;
ollections! On its impregnable heights, the patriot beholds the&#xD;
rampart which was defended by brave hearts and bold arms in&#xD;
the most gloomy period of our national history. A stern relic&#xD;
of a sterner age, the ruined fortress stands a monument of Ar-&#xD;
nold's .unsuccessful treason, while near'the smiling river is&#xD;
ground hallowed by the tread of Washington and Lafayette.&#xD;
Glorious, toois the magnificent scenery around, with its craggy&#xD;
rocks, its sparkling cascades, its lovely valleys, its picturesque&#xD;
mansions, its busy towns, its commerce-laden river-all forming&#xD;
a theme on which the lover of his country gazes with pride,&#xD;
while his heart throbs with gratitude to those who there perilled&#xD;
their lives to hinder a foreign foeman from profaning the spot&#xD;
with conquering tread. Ever step exhibits a new charm, and&#xD;
even old Father Rhine, so dear to landscape painters, is eclipsed&#xD;
by that portion of the Hudson of'which West Point is the cit-&#xD;
adel, and old Crow's Nest the frowning champion.&#xD;
The class in which Clement Spencer entered was one of unu-&#xD;
sual'promise, although ere the first year of study, had passed&#xD;
away, more than one who had held a brilliant position at the&#xD;
commencement of the term fell like a meteor, leaving a mourn-&#xD;
ful darkness behind the wreck of his glittering train. Others,&#xD;
who were proudly ambitious, yet held no exalted rank in the&#xD;
lists of intllect, impelled their energies forward with unfalter-&#xD;
ing determination for renown, their perseverance levelling ob-&#xD;
stacles to a near approach to the coveted "engineer appoint&#xD;
mentf," which is the reward of the foremost graduates.&#xD;
Clement Spencer, although not one of those governed by&#xD;
meteoric impulses, or given to plodding study, displayed idi-&#xD;
&#xD;
'V&#xD;
&#xD;
cations of high talents, and was especially distinguished for his&#xD;
pnarti'al bearing in the military exercises. To these attainments&#xD;
were added that cultivated wit, playful humor, and, conversa-&#xD;
tional power, which ever renders a young man's society pleas-&#xD;
ing and attractive; while the most graceful manners, ever easy&#xD;
and deferential, made him an ornament to "any social cir-le.&#xD;
Nature, too, had been liberal to the young cadet, whose figure&#xD;
was tall, slight and sinewy, while his face might have been&#xD;
taken by an artist as a model of manly beauty. His eyes were&#xD;
full and dark, with what might have been called a tetder ex-&#xD;
pression; but this feminine softness was relieved by a haughti-&#xD;
ness about the lips,, which, both in their form and comprehen-&#xD;
sion, gave an idea of energy and force. Snow-white teeth lent&#xD;
beauty to his smile-that smile which woman loves to look&#xD;
upon, for it comes from the heart. It was the heart which sent&#xD;
the flushed crimsonto the cheek, while the mind lighted up the&#xD;
symmetrical forehead, around which clustered his raven hair.&#xD;
This smile it was that enlivened his classical features, chasing&#xD;
away a sternness which at times hung over them like a thun-&#xD;
der-cloud over a flower-garden in the bright July.&#xD;
Of all his fellow-students, Clement preferred . a Georgian,&#xD;
named Allan Clayton. Full. of enthusiasm, and possessing&#xD;
great natural abilities, he could easily have been at the head of&#xD;
his class, but Clayton much preferred stealing, away to the&#xD;
river bank, and there passing the study hours in watching the&#xD;
vessels as they glided past, while he enjoyed a fragrant Havana.&#xD;
Of course, he was often reported, especially for non-attend-&#xD;
ance to those details of cadet-life which he considered 'menial.&#xD;
One of those was cleaning, his[ musket, and it was with some&#xD;
surprise that at a monthly inspection the officer found that Ca-&#xD;
det Clayton's piece was in excellent order. ,Clayton himself&#xD;
wasisomewhat surprised, for he was not aware that he had used&#xD;
sand-paper or rotten-stone, and the whole class were amazed to&#xD;
hear, at evening parade, "Cadet Spencer is sentenced to soli-&#xD;
tary confinement for twenty4our hours, for appearing at in-&#xD;
spection with his musket and bayonet disgracefully dirty anid&#xD;
unfit for use."&#xD;
This was the subject of conversation that evening, for Clement&#xD;
had always been a model for neatness and attention to duty,&#xD;
* nor was it until guard-mounting the next morning that the&#xD;
.mystery was solved.'&#xD;

"What!" exclaimed Clayton; "did you ,put my piece in&#xD;
order ?"1&#xD;
".Not I; but I did better."&#xD;
"How?"&#xD;
"Why, I took another musket from the rack, and as only the&#xD;
stocks are numbered, changed barrels, bands, locks and bayo-&#xD;
nets. Some poor fellow must have, had a job, for your barrel.&#xD;
was actually honey-combed with rust."&#xD;
Clayton rose, as if struck, and went directly to the principal,&#xD;
stating this exchange, and requesting that he-u-the innocent&#xD;
cause of Spencer's imprisonment--might be substnuted in his&#xD;
place. The gallant colonel, delighted with this generosity of&#xD;
heart, sent at once for the prisoner, and had both of the young,&#xD;
men dine with him. A warm friendship immediately sprang up&#xD;
between the two, aid upon obtaining their annual furlough,&#xD;
they went in company to New. York, where Mr. Spencer wished'&#xD;
Clement to remain a few days ere coming to Coalboro,.&#xD;
Well supplied with money, the two friends plunged deep into&#xD;
the dissipations of the metropolis, and the 'second night found&#xD;
them at a' noted gambling house near the Park. Clement never&#xD;
played at any game of chance, but. Clayton had a great fond-&#xD;
ness for such sports, and as "the -sights" were to be seen, they&#xD;
had put on. citizen's clothing-and gone.&#xD;
It was a magnificent establishment. Costly. draperies', richly-&#xD;
gilded picture-fraimes and furniture adapted for luxurious ease,&#xD;
were well calculated to entice the strangers who visited the&#xD;
city, while a well-set supper-table, at which several of the&#xD;
choicest wits in New York were always present, hadgreat fas-&#xD;
cinations' for the residents.&#xD;
Clement, seeing table covered with newspapers and periodi-&#xD;
cals in the first room they entered, took a seat, and told Clayton-&#xD;
thdt he would read until the fifty dollars in his pocket was lost.&#xD;
"Never mind," said Clayton, as he turned away, "I may&#xD;

Edinburgh Review, when some one near remarked, in a tone,&#xD;
which sounded familiar, that it was "a pleasant evening."&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied young Spencer, looking up. But he was&#xD;
not able to recognize the sharp, scrutinizing glance which met&#xD;
his.&#xD;
"You are not playing ?" said the stranger.&#xD;
"No, sir," answered Cleinent. "I have a friend who is, and&#xD;
am waiting here for him.&#xD;
To Clement's surprise, the stranger now inquired after Mr.&#xD;
Spencer and Martha Gray, displaying pn intimate acquaintance&#xD;
with Coalboro', and all the time watchifig him as a cat would&#xD;
watch a mouse. At last he asked;&#xD;
"by the way, what was your mother's maiden name, Mr.&#xD;
Spencer 2"&#xD;
The young man bit his lip through and through at. this ques-&#xD;
tion, at which no offence could be taken, btit which cut him to&#xD;
the very heart.&#xD;
"Surely; sir," he replied at length" this is' no place for fam-&#xD;
ily histories ?"&#xD;
"Ah!' proceeded the stranger, "I was about to give you&#xD;
some new facts relating to an interesting chapter of your own..&#xD;
Pardon me. for intruding it." And with a sarcastic smile, he&#xD;
bowed and left thesroom.&#xD;
In vain did Clement now attempt to read, for a desire to as-&#xD;
certain what the stranger knew of-his mother absorbed every&#xD;
other emotion. So, throwing down the Review, he rose and&#xD;
went into the next room.&#xD;
It wms devoted to the game of "roulette." A machine was&#xD;
on the centre of a large.table, covered with a green cloth, bear-&#xD;
ing certain signs in yellow 'and red, well-known to the initiated,&#xD;
-while in the centre were piles of gold. and silver, apparently&#xD;
fresh from the mint  Presiding over the game were two "crou-&#xD;
piers," pale from late watching, with features as* expressionless&#xD;
aifcut from marble. Around the table sat the players, some&#xD;
with faces seamed into an expression of tranquil cupidity, oth-&#xD;
~rs so excited by their sanguine temperaments as to rejoice&#xD;
vhen they won, and curse when they lost. Otherwise ae strict&#xD;
silence was observed, and the very click of .the ivory ball, as it&#xD;
Swas whirled around, was distinctly heard. Then came the an-&#xD;
nouncement of the winning color in a voice little above a whis-&#xD;

in the winnings of the bank, while the other was distributing&#xD;
the gains to the fortunate.&#xD;
But as neither Clayton nor the stranger was in this room,&#xD;
Clement passed into the next, where groups were gathered,&#xD;
around different tables, at which parties were paying with&#xD;
cards or dice. Among those. using thie last mentioned, were&#xD;
Clayton and-yes-young John Spencer. He had grown.taller&#xD;
and stouter since he visited Coalboro', and now wore a large&#xD;
black wig, but there was no mistaking the supercilious smile&#xD;
that played on his thin lips as he pocketed stake -after stake.&#xD;
His " run of luck was really extraordinary."&#xD;
Clayton was evidently much excited, and just as his friend&#xD;
approached the table, he laid down a gold eagle, saying:&#xD;
"Well, here goes my last dollar."I&#xD;
"I bet four to your one," replied John Spencer, with a drunk-&#xD;
en chuckle, as he put on the table four similar coins, just won&#xD;
from his opponent. "It's your throw."&#xD;
Clayton took the dice, and,. to, his own astonishment, threw&#xD;
within two of the highest number possible.&#xD;
"I must beat that,"-said John Spencer. But just as he was&#xD;
about to throw, he let the dice fall. Stooping, he picked them&#xD;
up, rather clumsily, and threw. Six was on the upper face of&#xD;
each one of the dice; again the same, andagain.&#xD;
But when this extraordinary result was visilile the last time,&#xD;
Clayton with a swoop seized the dice.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," he said, in a determined tone, "these dice&#xD;
must be examined.&#xD;
" Sir !" exclaimed the stranger, "do you dare accuse the son&#xD;
of John Spencer of fraud? Put down those dice !" ,&#xD;
" Yes!" screamed the detected culprit, stuttering and foaming&#xD;
with rage, although he turned white as a sheet. "Put down&#xD;
those dice. Who are you, any how ?"&#xD;
But Clayton leaned back in his chair with compressed lips,&#xD;
and no othersign of emotion visible on his composed features,&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
" I fear neither principal nor accomplice. Let the gentlemen&#xD;
present be judges."&#xD;
This calmness increased the rage of John Spencer and his&#xD;
friend; but those present-many of them declaring that Spen-&#xD;
cer had also won their money-insisted on having the dice test-&#xD;
ed. The keeper of the house was called, and he threw them.&#xD;
All1 beut forward, Every one presented the highest number.&#xD;

&#xD;
"They have been changed!" roared John Spencer. "He has&#xD;
done this to injure me. Who knows him?"&#xD;
"I do," said Clemeut, coming forward. "Ay, and I vouch for&#xD;
his honor as a cadet and as a gentleman. You know me."&#xD;
"Confound you!" exclaimed John. "You are always in my&#xD;
way. )Iere, take your money." Throwing the gold just won&#xD;
to. (Glayton, he left the room, the keeper of the house begging&#xD;
the company not ,to take any further notice of the "unhappy&#xD;
affair."&#xD;
Calling for the head waiter, Clayton told him to share the&#xD;
fifty dollars among the servants of the establishment, and they&#xD;
left. Traversing the Park, they were about entering the then&#xD;
fashionable hotel called " Washington Hall," where they put up,&#xD;
when a man. wrapped in a cloak came towards them, and when&#xD;
just opposite Clement,hissed out, "You are good at recognizing&#xD;
people; would you remember your mother ?"&#xD;
Turning, as if shot, he chased the man, but in vain. Yet he&#xD;
felt confident that it was' the stranger whom he had met at the&#xD;
gaming-house. Alas! was this fatal secret ever to hang over&#xD;
him like an incubus?&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
LOVE AND HATRED.&#xD;
&#xD;
AFTER remaining in New York a few days, during which the&#xD;
cadets neither saw nor heard from John Spencer, Jr., they left&#xD;
for Coalboro', where they were received by Mr. Spencer with a&#xD;
hearty welcome. The old gentleman had heard of his godson's&#xD;
high position at the academy, to which he was by no means in-&#xD;
sensible, and Martha Gray, now confined to her room by old&#xD;
age, received "her boy " with tears of joy. Entertainments&#xD;
were given on every hand, and the wearers of the neat'gray&#xD;
uniforms made a deep impression upon many a fair heart. Cloy-&#xD;
ton was a professed flirt, but in vain did bright eyes shed their&#xD;
softest rays at the approach of Mr. Spen'cer's heir, while* the&#xD;
mamas saw that all the, artillery of th.ir daughters' coquetry&#xD;
was called forth and properly aimed.  voted to his studies,&#xD;
Clement's mind-kingdom of pleasant thoughts had yet preserved&#xD;
itself from the invasion of these conquering "granny-dears "&#xD;

who urged, forward their "light-troops " against the parapets of&#xD;
marriageable young men's affections, and, amid the tumult&#xD;
which they raise, often manage to let the besiegers into the&#xD;
citadels of the besieged heart. Once there, capitulation is&#xD;
inevitable.&#xD;
Often, during this pleasant visit, did Clement long for an op-&#xD;
portunity to seek an explanation as to his own history from&#xD;
Mr. Spencer.. But Claytoii was generally with him, and no it&#xD;
occasion presenting itself, he returned to West Point no wiser&#xD;
than he came.                       0-&#xD;
The very day after their arrival at West Point, they were&#xD;
summoned before the principal,who showed them an anony-&#xD;
mous letter, stating that they had not only visited a gambling-&#xD;
house while at New York, but had become engaged in a dis-&#xD;
graceful brawl- while there.&#xD;
Clayton immediately gave a correct version of the affair, not&#xD;
concealing the fact that he had played, but exculpating his&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
"Well, well," said the colonel; "the letter has no signature,&#xD;
aud therefore cannot be considered-a complaint of which I can&#xD;
take official cognizance. But don't let me learn any more such&#xD;
stories of your adventures."&#xD;
The young men thanked him cordially, and withdrew, vowing&#xD;
vengeance against the anonymous informer. That it was young&#xD;
John Spencer, neither entertained a doubt.&#xD;
It was soon the season for the annual visit of the Board of&#xD;
Visitors, and the hotel was filled with fair representatives of al-&#xD;
most every State, either relatives of members of the board, or&#xD;
of some cadet. The observed of all observers in this galaxy of&#xD;
beauty, was Miss Ida, daughter and heiress of Robert Patterson,&#xD;
of New York, who had been appointed a member of the board.&#xD;
He was a millionaire, the architect of his own fortune; and with&#xD;
him all things, both divine and human, were subservient to&#xD;
money-making. Indeed, it was his boast that though a laborer's,&#xD;
son, he was born to make a fortune-that is, he was born with-&#xD;
out a soul, and had he earned but sixpence .a day, he would&#xD;
have saved but half of it.&#xD;
His career at school was characteristic, for even the presents&#xD;
of marbles which he occasionally received from fhis playmates&#xD;
Were carefully hoarded, up, and then. sold back to them as occa7&#xD;
sion offered. Entering a mercantile house as-an erraind-boy, he&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
had crowded his way to its head-despised, yet useful, and.not&#xD;
hated because he had not spirit enough toquarrei Beginning&#xD;
'life without4 a cent of capital, ie was now master of a colossal&#xD;
fbrtune- which he frequently doubled by, lending sumns-ofrit at a&#xD;
large interest, upon the best security. Indeed he had sought&#xD;
the appointment of a member of the Board of Visitors, because'&#xD;
it would enable him to bring his only daughter to West Point,&#xD;
where she could recruit her health without any extra expense.&#xD;
Such was the father; but 0, how different was the daughter,&#xD;
now in the flrst- dawn of beauty. Her mother was a French&#xD;
countess, who had' fled from Paris when her first husband had&#xD;
been brought to the guillotine by. Robespierre, bringing the&#xD;
Wreck of her fortune in letters of credit for a considerable sum&#xD;
on Mr.. Patterson. le, as the easiest way of paying them, mar-&#xD;
ried her, and really treated her with great kindness. This he&#xD;
transferred to her babe, Who was- left motherless at an early&#xD;
ge, and who was thenceforth her father's idol. For his credi-&#xD;
tors, or for poor suppliants for his charity, he had no- mercy, but&#xD;
his daughter Ida he indulged in the fantasies of her childhood,&#xD;
and then in the desires of her girlhood, until, at the age of sev-&#xD;
enteen, she had never known disappointment. Her life had been&#xD;
all sunshine, and love was yet a stranger to her breast.&#xD;
She was aiiagelic-creature, Clemert Spencer thought, when&#xD;
he first saw her.~ Her patrician features were small and regu-&#xD;
lar, cut in the most exact.proportion, yet so clearly defined that.&#xD;
to gaze-on'the Grecian nose and arching upper lip, one might&#xD;
have fancied traces of 'sonme sculptor's chisel before the mad-&#xD;
iieis of passion had wished the lovely statue into life. Her eyes&#xD;
were deep blue, so deep that when shaded by their' drooping&#xD;
eyelashes they appeared almost black, as they sparkled with&#xD;
gaiety or melted into-tenderness. Her hair was-of that precious&#xD;
shade' -of auburn- -which seems to catch the sunbeams, and from.&#xD;
her.,mot   she inherited the- graceful elastic form that had&#xD;
made a long line of ancestresses renowned, even at the court of&#xD;
Versailles. Ther  was nought of heaviness about it; all the&#xD;
graceful deliikcy reinained;: while- the tiny foot, the well-pro-'&#xD;
portioned waist, and the small, plump hand, 'but added2 to the&#xD;
charm of her symmetrical yet well-developed form.&#xD;
.Her features,.unsuccessful wooers said, were too passive, as 'if'&#xD;
the currents of her existence' were to be stirred by their-vapid&#xD;
nonsense. They said, too-those 'flatterimig gold-hunters-that'&#xD;
she was fair and cold as the' polar night, and that theirs was the&#xD;

fate of those navigators who seek to find an Arctic sea of re-&#xD;
pose. But they little knew what warm passion looked covertly&#xD;
forth from her eyes, those windows of the soul, whose light be-&#xD;
lied the scornful arching of her lips. True, she cared little for&#xD;
her suitors, or for those around her in society. Her conscious-&#xD;
ness that there was more in life than was dreamed of in the hol-&#xD;
low philosophy of the hollow' world, made her shrink from the&#xD;
foibles of fshionable life, and. from those who found in such a&#xD;
life all their aspirations fulfilled. Her father's society-,was all&#xD;
she co-veted, nor could she imagine any one superior to him, or&#xD;
capable of promoting her happiness. When with him, the cold&#xD;
sneer vanished from her lips, and a. sunlight smile danced -over&#xD;
her features like an embodied joy, or nestled cosily in the di-&#xD;
ples of her cheeks.&#xD;
One of Mr. Patterson's most fortunate investments had been&#xD;
in the Coalboro' Mining Company, and believing that young&#xD;
Clenient Spencer was the son and heir of the energetic presi-&#xD;
dent, he looked upon the young cadet with great favor. He&#xD;
was almost a daily visitor at the hotel, and although he gazed&#xD;
at Ida almost unceasingly when in her presence, he never&#xD;
sought to attract her attention to himself. Oftentimes, in the'&#xD;
midst of a lively conversation with a. gay throng of admirers,&#xD;
would Ida pause and listen as the sounds of Clement's voice fell&#xD;
upon her ear, and soon she not only listened, but sought oppor-&#xD;
tunities to engage him in conversation. The value of his mind&#xD;
was easily apparent as contrasted with the frivolous votaries of,&#xD;
fashion who circled around to laud her beauty, and though.,&#xD;
Clement never complimented her, she did not doubt his appre-&#xD;
ciation of her charms.&#xD;
Mr. Patterson appeared deliglited with the intimacy between&#xD;
the young people, and with his full approbation they soon began.&#xD;
to take lzng strolls, visiting scenes around West Point that are&#xD;
not Acadian, only because those haunts of old were less grad&#xD;
and magnificent. But the dreamylanguor of the summer hours&#xD;
had the same benign and softening influence, and this Atlantic&#xD;
Temnpe, with its crags and valleys, its pools and waterfalls, and&#xD;
a mightier river than Peneus gliding along its verdant and bat-&#xD;
tiemented steeps, wras the very place (like the divine, Egei-ia of&#xD;
ancients),to awaken the feeling of love in the 'hearts of the&#xD;
young. A bright moon was not without its influence, throwing&#xD;
its elfin beams upon the broad parad, .while the famous band&#xD;
discoursed martial strains, or turning into silver leaflets the&#xD;

foliageof Kosciusko's-garden. Poets may tell of infantilejoy at&#xD;
play,'or of the tranquil serenity of honored old 'age, but on&#xD;
earth there is not a ray of bliss .to be compared. to that which&#xD;
love-linked hearts feel in moonlight promenades. -Then it is&#xD;
that young lovers might wish that mortality was lmmortal,-&#xD;
then it is that they regard earth as a paradise, aiid care not for&#xD;
a brighter or purer heaven,&#xD;
Of course, it was soon rumored about that Cadet Spencer.had&#xD;
made a favorable impression on the great heiress, and the news&#xD;
was not long in reaching New York, where John Spencer, Sr.,&#xD;
heard it on 'change. The same morning he received intelli-&#xD;
gence that a shipment of flour had resulted in a loss of some&#xD;
ten thousand dollars, and when he reached home he was not in&#xD;
a very amiable state of mind. He found his family at dinner,&#xD;
and, to add fresh fuel to his wrath, the -meats were cold.&#xD;
"Well, John," he at last -growled out, "-when did you see&#xD;
that Patterson girl?"&#xD;
" Just before she left for West Point," said the unsuspecting&#xD;
young man. "I hope, sir, I can have a pair of fast trotters to&#xD;
take her to ride with when she comes back."&#xD;
"You'd better-you'd better. Wouldn't you like me to get a&#xD;
house for you to treat her to, and furnish it at that ?"&#xD;
"Why, how generous you are I" exclaimed Mrs. Spencer.&#xD;
"Why not promise me a new carriage now, also ?"&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks, ma'am! Htimbug I Here I've been spending&#xD;
money like water to bring about this match, and after all, my&#xD;
young gentleman can't shine. He has beat the bush, but an-&#xD;
other hand has caught the bird ?"&#xD;
"Who, sir ?" eagerly inquired John, turning very red.&#xD;
"Who? Who do you suppose? Why,.the Right Honorable&#xD;
Clement Spencer, Jr., who first housed you out of your uncle's&#xD;
property, aid now has taken the rich bride you have fished for&#xD;
so hard."&#xD;
The young man felt no beart-regret, for he was not capable&#xD;
of loving so pure a creature as jIda Patterson, and had only&#xD;
pretended to be paying his court to her 'that he might draw&#xD;
larger supplies of money for the gratification of, h~is dissipated&#xD;
tastes. But to think that Clement shquld Again step before him&#xD;
was unendurable.&#xD;
. ~" I will go to West Point to-night !" he exclaimed.&#xD;
" Stop a moment," plausibly remarked Professor Pike. " You&#xD;

this fellow's brother cadets, and you know those desperadoes&#xD;
always make common cause. I. haie often thought about this&#xD;
interloper, and it really seems to me that it is necessary, and at&#xD;
the same time pecuniarily advantageous, that he should be set&#xD;
back as the saying is. Made to take his place as a foundling,&#xD;
and not be thwarting the&amp;amp; wishes and interests of our, first&#xD;
families."&#xD;
Ah, professor," said Mrs. Spencer, "them are just my ideas."&#xD;
'And mine,"chimed in young John.&#xD;
"Ditto-ditto! I endorse over all," remarked John, senior,&#xD;
"and will underwrite the expenses to any amount under a&#xD;
thousand dollars, if the thing is well done."&#xD;
"I will leave for West Point without delay," ,answered the&#xD;
delighted professor, whe saw a chance to gratify his hatred, and&#xD;
to make what 'he' could appropriate of the sum. "The matter&#xD;
must be looked to without delay, for as Shakspeare says, 'If 'tis&#xD;
to be done, when 'tis done, then 'tis well 'twere done quickly.' "&#xD;
While they sat, concocting diabolical schemes for the dis-&#xD;
grace of the young cadet, there was a loud knocking at the&#xD;
door, and soon a messenger from Coalboro' was ushered in,&#xD;
who brought important tidings. He had been ordered to pro-&#xD;
ceed to West Point, but Professor Pike promptly remonstrated,&#xD;
saying that he would carry the message, and should leave in the&#xD;
morning.&#xD;
So it was agreed that both of the John Clements should re-&#xD;
turn with the messenger to Coalboro', and that Professor Pike&#xD;
and Mrs. Spencer should go to West Point. Cunning ,piders&#xD;
of humanity, how  they chuckled as they laid the meshes of&#xD;
their web of crime .&#xD;

Tot next evening witnessed the annual ball at West Point,&#xD;
a scene of festivity much talked of beforehand, expected With&#xD;
.as -mtee and attended by every one who had any posi-&#xD;
tion ormcnntieneon that could secure an invitation. The Board&#xD;
of Visitors and the officers of the academy were all there; not&#xD;
a cadet was absent. N~ew York sent up a large quota of belles&#xD;
&#xD;
THE .WEST PINO ICAETI&#xD;
and. young men of. no particular occupation, while all the&#xD;
towns about. were well represented, Beauty, diamonds and&#xD;
uniforms. seemed to. vie with each other in brilliancy, honeyed&#xD;
words were murmured by irresistible voices in charmed ears,&#xD;
and the unequalled band, led by Willis and his bugle, poured&#xD;
out a continued flood of the Y'ichest and most. inspiring har-&#xD;
mony.&#xD;
What imparted interest to this fascinating scene, was the fact&#xD;
among the officers present, several were "under orders " for&#xD;
the far West, to engage for years in hostilities with'the treach-&#xD;
erous savages. How uncertain were the chances that they&#xD;
would for long years ever enjoy- such pleasures again-nay,&#xD;
many a gallant heart that then beat in, unison to .the :sweet&#xD;
strains might soon be. cold and still-many a bright eye that&#xD;
gazed tenderly and kindly would consequently be dimmed and&#xD;
tearful! Yet every one seemed disposed to enjoy themselves;&#xD;
the floor vibrated beneath the feet of those who joined, in the&#xD;
mazes of the dance; vigilant mothers were kept busy In decid-&#xD;
ing upon the "elegibility " of partners; and that wine of the,&#xD;
heart which ripens on the sunny plains of Champagne, was&#xD;
quaffed i libations to the success of the graduating class in&#xD;
particular, with many other general toasts.&#xD;
Ida Patterson and Clement Spencer were Conspicuous among&#xD;
the throng; both were exquisite dancers, and the grace of their&#xD;
movements, not less than. her Irresistible loveliness and his.&#xD;
manly beauty, attracted general admiration. Yet neither cared&#xD;
for the gay scene, and when the guests went out on the parade-&#xD;
ground at midnight to hear the band play "Auld Lang Syne"&#xD;
-in accordance with the time-honored custom of those days,-&#xD;
the enraptured pair insensibly directed their steps to the pic-p&#xD;
turesque retreat know as Kosciusko's garden.&#xD;
This romantic spot lies nestled_ upon the face of the river-&#xD;
bank, like a dimple upon the cheek of a lovely woman, and Is.,&#xD;
embosomed in thiek foliage, formin-g a framework forth clear&#xD;
fountain coscae by the Polish hero's memory. It was as&#xD;
quiet as the grave, calm as an angel's heart, and illumined by the&#xD;
peaceful rays of a full,overhanging moon.. The night breeze&#xD;
scarcely stirred the trees; the snowy sails of the passing sloops&#xD;
loomed up in the moonlight like colossal spirits, as they noise-&#xD;
lessly glided on their liquid path, and the only sound was. dur-&#xD;
ing the transit of a steamboat, its cqurge marked by a waving&#xD;
canopy of meteor-like sparks, pid by the undulating track&#xD;

gnd a dominant idea i each heart; appy couple !   They&#xD;
vere not skilled in analyzing their affection-they only felt its&#xD;
power, and bowdd to it and enj oyed it-yes, enjoyed it. For&#xD;
what earthly"enjyment chn compete with the affection of"&#xD;
fouthftil and unpratitised- hearts, who love with all the sincerity&#xD;
nd- simplicity of natuiire, and with that intensity never experi-'&#xD;

6ge of humai eisteisce, that season of first love,'b"ut, alas! it&#xD;
passes ai speedily as the fabled one of the world has done.,&#xD;
A glorious subject f&amp;amp;iia painter wouldit have been to poray&#xD;
that'gallant cadet, with genial sincerity beandag from his true&#xD;
eyes, turning from the beautiful scene ai-ound to gaze upon a&#xD;
countenauce brighter than the moonlight and gentle? than the&#xD;
zephyr br-eeze. Ida, sitting in eloquent silence-more eloquent&#xD;
than idle words, with her long eyelashes drooped on her flushed&#xD;
cheek, where: glowed the hue 6f the rosebul when it feels the&#xD;
warmth of early spring yet dai-es not open its leaves. Glorious&#xD;
monient toewoman is it tabia she first loves; foi- its inibuence&#xD;

againr. Womah~, wVho keep the vow he breathes, can never&#xD;
believe again 'if her credulity is mocked, for the ver esee of&#xD;
love is belief.&#xD;
Their eyes met, and'Clement felt the fal fore of that resist-&#xD;
less emotion, whose pervading influence sways with oiie comn-&#xD;
nion-impulse all animal ife. Clasping her gentle hand, he pas-&#xD;
sionately exclaimed: "Ida, I love you!"&#xD;

Clement;yvaliant with affection,: told his love in lirried yet&#xD;

she ever Inspired such an attachment. than he should be awak-&#xD;
ened from such a dream-a dream of more than earthly happi-'&#xD;
ness, for he had madly dreamed that she reciprocated 1 his feel-&#xD;
ings, and would love him in return.&#xD;
He paused, but she did not reply; she could not. The sweet&#xD;
moment had come that her heart had yearned for, yet, her whole&#xD;
frame quivering with emotion, her lips failed to utter the words&#xD;
of her heart's framing. Yet her silence was nature's language&#xD;
-inimitable by the feigning pretender, yet easily interpreted by&#xD;
the instinctive sagacity of him who felt that he was the cause of&#xD;
.the lack of speech.' The gentle pressure of her-hand was more&#xD;
eloquent than language, and' although no vow came from her&#xD;
tremulous lip, Clement felt that the promise had been given' in&#xD;
her heart-ay, and that its record had been entered in the un-&#xD;
blotted volume of the recording 'angel. Full of joy, and hope&#xD;
and confldenc% he clasped her to his heart.&#xD;
"Ida-dearest Ida," he exclaimed, "say that I can call you&#xD;
mine!"&#xD;
He felt her heart beat wildly against his own, as she mur-&#xD;
mured:&#xD;
"Yes, yes-yours until death!"&#xD;
Raising her face towards his, he saw the truth at the bottom&#xD;
of- her well-like eyes, and sealed the pledge of love by burning&#xD;
kisses upon her yielding lips, until-maiden modesty regaining"&#xD;
it* sway-she gently disengaged herself.&#xD;
"K ay !" whispered Clement, drawing' her closer to him, and&#xD;
gazing. as if he almost doubted his own senses. But when Ahe&#xD;
returned his ardent kiss, -with a sudden iqX~pulse, and. then&#xD;
broke from his embrace, he felt that it was  ong to detain her&#xD;
longer,. and sat down calmly by her .side, upon the marble&#xD;
fountain.&#xD;
There-they remained for an hour, their thoughts pure as the&#xD;
crystal water at their side, while the rays of the moon gleamed&#xD;
upon them through the dark trees,, like smiles of hope contend-&#xD;
iag withthe shades of sorrow upon the brow of humanity. H&#xD;
told her of his mountain home, of his indulgent-gxdfather-f&#xD;
his hopes of glory, and ever through his wordabrie, like a sil'&#xD;
ver thread, ran a heart-wish that she might share hif lot--mnight:.&#xD;

assents,. and felt, happier than she had ever felt befote.. The&#xD;
sweet tones of Clement's musical voice, tremulous With passion,&#xD;
found their way to her inmost soul; nor did a doubt, or a fear,&#xD;
block up the avenue of her enjoyment. It was the golden mo-&#xD;
ment of her life, and willing was she to surrender the flower of&#xD;
her affections, her sympathies, her unclouded nature, and her&#xD;
unsullied purity. Her heart, like that of heir lover, was well'&#xD;
prepared by previous absence of all ardent emotions, to become&#xD;
completely absorbed at once by the all-conquering passion.&#xD;
Each- alike yielded to the rapturous invasion.&#xD;
A.discordant sound disturbed their happy thoughts.&#xD;
"Never mind," said, Clement; "the ball is over, and the&#xD;
younger cadets are indulging in their usual revelry of a bur-&#xD;
lesque parade."&#xD;
."The ball over I" exclaimed -Ida, blushing deeply. "Let us&#xD;
hurry back to the hotel. I hope we have not been missed, for&#xD;
I so detest scandal."&#xD;
"Not more than I do, loved one. But it may be well to re-&#xD;
turn." - And-they left that romantic spot, to which each was&#xD;
thenceforth to look back as an oasis on the great arid desert of&#xD;
life. A few moments more, and they parted at the door of the&#xD;
hotel, now -deserted by the merry throng.&#xD;
As Clement Spencer. turned away, the well-known voice of&#xD;
Clayton called him:&#xD;
"Look here, old fellow, I am detai16d to bring you to Hal&#xD;
WilkisonI's room, and have no idea of having been made to&#xD;
wait here' an hour-no cigar at that-without carrying you,&#xD;
along in triumph."&#xD;
Now the happy lover would much rather have retired to the&#xD;
solitdicle of his own quarters, there to recall the joys of the even-&#xD;
ing, but he could not refuse the invitation, he well knew, with-&#xD;
out giving offence. So he'took Glayton's arm, -and they were&#xD;
s9on welconied with cheers at the festive board.- It was a choice&#xD;
galas~y.of good spirits then and there assembled, many of them.&#xD;
sigeie distinguished in their country's service, but at thattime&#xD;
notedjfgr ad pranks and jovial revelry. Songs, stories, toasts&#xD;
and jests were poured f#11th- as profusely as the wine; norwa&#xD;
it to, be swondered. at that as the fun grew more boisterous, some&#xD;
evidences of intoxication became evident.&#xD;
Prominent among those' whose thickened. utterances and&#xD;
flushmd faees gave token. of their too copious libations,a was a&#xD;
eqa~ceited ypung esdet frosn ENew Y ork city, known among his&#xD;
&#xD;
comrade. as Count Discount. His father was a wealthy broker&#xD;
in     street, and the liberal supplies of money. enjoyed by the&#xD;
ison made him an object of envy, while it magnified his self-&#xD;
importance until it often became offensive. He had been a&#xD;
great admirer of Ida Patterson in the city, and when she had&#xD;
come to West Point e endeavored to. monopolize her. She,&#xD;
however, soon gave h m to understand that she did not wish to&#xD;
receive any attention from him, and this considerate nipping of&#xD;
his affection in the bad had rankled in his beclouded heart&#xD;
since.&#xD;
The healths of several ladies were drank with uproarious&#xD;
applause, when Clayton thoughtlessl proposed that of M'IsS&#xD;
Patterson."&#xD;
"Stop I" hiccupped Wilkinson, in an ironical tone. "I could&#xD;
tell you something about that paragon of prudery which might.&#xD;
make you all wish to toast a bumper."&#xD;
"What is it ?" asked several voices.&#xD;
Why, the dear creature cut us all at the ball, and then stole&#xD;
off to Kosciusko's garden to enjoy a confidential flirtation."&#xD;
"Who with ?" asked a thoughtless cadet.&#xD;
"With a gray coatee," said Wilkinson, turning his insolent,&#xD;
drunken leer upon'Clement Spencer, "and with a cadet in its"&#xD;
Spencer's cheeks tingled with rage, but he maintained his&#xD;
self-possession.&#xD;
Perhaps," continued Wilkinson, with a sarcastic curl of his&#xD;
lip, "those interested in this paragon of perfection will call up-&#xD;
on Cadet Spencer."&#xD;
9'5Gentlemen may not thus wish to have a lady's name intro-&#xD;
daced here," calmly replied Spencer, to whom all eyes were&#xD;
directed.&#xD;
Those who kiss never tell," was the provoking response.&#xD;
Wilkinson, this has gone far enoughI" exclaimed Spencer,&#xD;
and several crowded around the drunken man, hoping to pacify&#xD;
him. But it was of no avail.&#xD;
I'll tell, though!I" he shouted, in a shrill voice. "You kiss-&#xD;
ed Ida Patterson, and she-&#xD;
Ere he could finish the sentence, Spencer sprang towards him,&#xD;
and with -a blow levelled him to the ground. Then turning&#xD;
towards his friend, he said, with no sign of emotion:&#xD;
"Let us go, Clayton. Of course you will receive any mes-&#xD;
8age which this prying slanderer chooses to send me." And&#xD;
amidst the expressed applause of almost every opne pr sent, he&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
DEAT[AND DEFIANCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ONWARD-onWard hastened young Clement Spencer, impa-&#xD;
tient to see him who had ever shown him a parent's love. The&#xD;
stage stopped for the night some twenty miles distant- froin&#xD;
Coalboro', but he obtained a horse, and lhastened over the moun--&#xD;
taina, sick-at heart, and with the bitter tears of agony at times&#xD;
bursting from his aching eyes. His horse was a'strong one, but&#xD;
hardly able to endure the pace at which- he was, urged, with&#xD;
whip, spur and voice, over the craggy hills. Already had, his&#xD;
soul reached'the home of his youth, but around hi6- barely visi-.&#xD;
ble in the misty moonlight, were barren rock, and dwarfedpines,&#xD;
as his body pursued its laborious transit. Eagerly did he look&#xD;
forward through the dim distance, and at last-joyfulsight even&#xD;
to his sad spirit-were the lights of his childhood's home.&#xD;

left the room, feeling that he1.had' acted as a man..of honor'&#xD;
should act under such circumstances.&#xD;
Arriving at his own-quarters, he saw a stranger,,. yet started,&#xD;
at the tones of a voicewhich sounded familiarly.&#xD;
"I am Professor-Pikej sir,:wIra was at Coalboro' with, young&#xD;
Mr. John Spencer. His father,,Mr. John -Spencer, seniorfhas&#xD;
received news that Mr. Clement Spencer is dangerously ill--"&#xD;
"Ill? What is the, disorder ?" interrupted Clenient.&#xD;
"He -caught cold while attending .the funeral. of.;a servant-&#xD;
woman named Gray. His brother hAs gone to see him, and&#xD;
thought that youshould.know it. SoI have come here express-&#xD;
ly tolet you know."&#xD;
Luckily for the sorrow-stricken young man, his friend Clay-&#xD;
ton came along just. then, and tookhim. under-his- harge. ByT&#xD;
his efforts, leave' of absence was obtained immediately from the&#xD;
kind-hearted colonel in command, and the. morningboat from'&#xD;
Newburg took Clement to.New-York. He:felt a 4ad presenti-&#xD;
ment that his god-father would breathe iis last. ere, he could&#xD;
reach'CoAlboro'; but amid all his gloomy thiaghts. camue the-&#xD;
tones of Professor Pike's voice. Where had he heardit .?&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
:2&#xD;
&#xD;
A light was visible in'the room which Mr. Spencer used as an&#xD;
office, but of that Clement took little heed, as he jumped from&#xD;
his exhausted horse, and rushed into the house. Everything&#xD;
seemed quiet, so different from the commotion which thoughts&#xD;
of his protector's death had been producing in his own heart&#xD;
during the ride, and hope again beat within his breast. Hasten-&#xD;
ing up stairs, he stood for a moment at the door of his god-&#xD;
father's chamber. -All was quiet- within. Cautioiely opening&#xD;
the door, he-saw by a dim taper the old nian lying, as he -thought,&#xD;
quietly asleep, and tiptoed so gently to the bedside that the&#xD;
drowsy attendant did not hear him. A pleasant smile softened&#xD;
the emaciated yet well-known features; but when -the- young&#xD;
man touched his lips gently to those which had expressed so&#xD;
much love for him, he kissed a corpse..&#xD;
The old man was lifeless. He was in the diamber of death.&#xD;
Everything in the room swam around with a whirl; there was&#xD;
a cry of deep, deep anguish, and Clement Spencer, now the only&#xD;
one of that name, fell senseless on the floor.&#xD;
"What's the matter?" cried old John Spencer, who soon&#xD;
rushed into the room, white with fear, and followed by his son.&#xD;
"Master Cleinent has fainted," said Mrs. Egan, who at once&#xD;
recognized the child of her fostering, and endeavored to restore&#xD;
him to' consciousness.&#xD;
"lHe needn't have scared us so," growled young John, who&#xD;
had evidently been much alarmed.&#xD;
" Never mind-never mind," said .his father. "He'll have&#xD;
something to faint about soon. But where's that Egan W"&#xD;
"My husband " asked the woman, who was kneeling by&#xD;
Clement and chafing his temples. "I hope he is doing nothing&#xD;
.n&#xD;
"No-ah! here-he comes. Take this fainted fellow, Egan,&#xD;
and car y him up stairs. Your wife will show you some spare&#xD;
room, 'if you don't know -one. Then come down to us'"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied Egan. "I got the lock picked just a-&#xD;
you-&#xD;
" Silence !" thundered John Spencer. Then with an express-&#xD;
ive gesture he left the room, followed by his son.&#xD;
" Meredith," said the kneeling woman, " for years have you&#xD;
abused me, yet I have not complained. But now; on my knees&#xD;
between that dead old man and this young one, almost my child,&#xD;
who lies on the very edge 'of death, I pray you to do no&#xD;
wrong."&#xD;

THE WIEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;
The man stood as if irresolute, with his eyes cast down, and&#xD;
strong passions evidently at play within his breast.&#xD;
Him there weren't kind to me," he said; "he put me in the&#xD;
county jail."&#xD;
Why, Meredith ? Was it not in the hope.'of reforminig you&#xD;
-of weaning you from the demon of intemperance ? O, Mere-&#xD;
dith, for the sake of our happy young days among the hills of&#xD;
Wales, do not wrong to-night.".&#xD;
I bent a doing wrong, lass; I'm only opening the gent's&#xD;
trunk, that he came away without the key of. Come, let's carry&#xD;
the young fellow up to bed. Dear me, how large and fine-look-&#xD;
ing,,he's grown !"&#xD;
"Ay, he's far different from the child handed. me by Martha&#xD;
Gray, poor woman. Her last talk was of him."&#xD;
"And did she know who his mother was ?"&#xD;
No. I asked her oft and again, and I feel sure that she did&#xD;
not know. But I think she felt sure that Mr. Spencer'did."&#xD;
Come!" called a loud voice from down stairs. "Why not&#xD;
take that chap to bed, and come down here ?"W&#xD;
Coming, sir," replied Meredith. Then muttering to himself,&#xD;
he said_ "Were you more civil, you might get more for your&#xD;
money."~&#xD;
Removed to his own room,'Clement gradually recovered con-&#xD;
sciousness, And was acquainted by his nurse with the sad par-&#xD;
ticulars of Mr. Spencer's fatal illness. He had taken cold while&#xD;
attending the funeral of poor Martha Gray (who had died of&#xD;
sheer old age), and seemed to sink at once into the arms of&#xD;
death.&#xD;
He sent for you, Clement," continued the faithful nurse,&#xD;
and seemed anxiously to, wait your coming. Hour after hour&#xD;
would he inquire for you, and when-at last his brother came arid&#xD;
told him that you would not start until after some great ball, he&#xD;
seemed to lose all hope. For hours he lay in a stupor. 'Then&#xD;
opening his eyes, he asked: 'Has Clement come?' 'No,' re-&#xD;
plied his brother; 'but here is my son John, your nephew.'&#xD;
'No, no,' feebly ejaculated Mr. Spencer. ' I want Clement.'-.&#xD;
And murmuring your name again and again, he sank gently&#xD;
into his death-sleep. 0, 'twas such a pity that you could not&#xD;
have been here at once, instead of stopping for that ball !"&#xD;
"Nurse Egan," said Clement, in a firm tone, " did I not. .-&#xD;
ways speak the truth when a child ?"&#xD;
"You did, God less you!",&#xD;
&#xD;
42&#xD;
&#xD;
43&#xD;
&#xD;
"And I have since. 'Never-I swear It by him who li4s dead&#xD;
below us-did I hear of my dear godfather's sickness until after&#xD;
the ball, and I came here as fast as man could come. -Alas that&#xD;
I was too late P"&#xD;
"You have been sadly belied, Clement. Never mind; they'll&#xD;
go away soon."&#xD;
"And may   y curse go with them. Now, my dear nurse, go&#xD;
to bed. I wil watch by' the remains of my kind protector."&#xD;
"But no. You are tired, and need rest."&#xD;
"There is no rest for atroubled heart," was Clement's reply;&#xD;
and he carried Iis point.&#xD;
,4  -&#xD;
Returning to' the chamber of death, he 'drew a chair to the&#xD;
bedside, and there he sat until the funeral hour, heedless of all&#xD;
around him. At times,, in accordance with the earnest entrea-&#xD;
ties of his nurse, he would partake of slight refreshment, but&#xD;
hasten back to his Vigil-post, as if stern duty called him there.&#xD;
Company he had in those pleasant features composed in death.&#xD;
Since his earliest recollection had they smiled upon him; but&#xD;
now the bond was snapped, the silver cord was broken. "'One&#xD;
was taken and the other left." And of all the thoughts that&#xD;
flitted through the young watcher's mind, was the sad reflection&#xD;
that,' if the departed friend' before him knew the secret of his&#xD;
birth, those cold lips could never confide it. It must 'be buried&#xD;
with him, and with it would be buried many a cherished&#xD;
hope.&#xD;
The hour appointed for the burial arrived, and for the first&#xD;
time since his arrival, Clement saw John Spencer and his son,&#xD;
each assuming a hypocritical air of sadness. They wept, or pre-&#xD;
tended'to weep, as they took their.last look at 'the placid fea-&#xD;
tures of their deceased relative, but Clement displayed his 'sor-&#xD;
row by' no paroxysm of grief. His countenance was fixed'and&#xD;
rigid', but a close observer of nature could see that the bitter&#xD;
fountains of his' heart were unsealed, and as heimprinted a last&#xD;
kiss upon that pale brow, tears fell uponit like the dew of heaven.&#xD;
An immense multitude attended the last sorrowful rites, with&#xD;
silence, and with reverence, for the deceased 'was looked upon as&#xD;
the parent of the flourishing community which had grown up&#xD;
since his discovery. There was no muffled drum .or mournful&#xD;
)ageantry, but far more impressive ant effect ive was the peace-&#xD;
ful sadness which brooded over the town, and the solemn grief&#xD;
expressed on the countenances of the hundreds who wer-e group-&#xD;
ed around the grave, when earth was mingled wit earth.&#xD;

-of death, ClementJw IMreenieg to the'solitude  f his own&#xD;
chamber, w1en he heArd the harp voice of M.rSpencer calling&#xD;
his name.&#xD;
Come in here, you, sir," continued the merchant. "I wish&#xD;
to have a chat with you."&#xD;
Mechanically, obeying, Clement entered the room, where he&#xD;
sayw two awyers: of the place, 'and the Spencers. The father&#xD;
smiled on him beignantly, but.the sn's features wore an air of&#xD;
triumph.&#xD;
"Well, sir," said the elder Mr. Spencer, " I have called you in&#xD;
to ask youif you have any knowledge of a will having ever been&#xD;
made by 'my brother."&#xD;
Shocked ptothis inquiry, made ere the sod had been placed on&#xD;
the grave of his benefactor, element simplyreplied.:&#xD;
"I have not."&#xD;
"Good!" exclaimed young John, a smile of malicious satis-&#xD;
faction playing over his countenancee'&#xD;
"Silence, my son !" said the fther. "I know how you, in&#xD;
common with myself, have smarted under the reflection that this&#xD;
young man has wormed himself into the heart of my deceased&#xD;
brother. Nay, I admit that I had expected to fid that he had&#xD;
extorted some testamentary provision. But you, gentlemen,&#xD;
have examined de desks of my brother, and -I understand you&#xD;
to say that you find no will."&#xD;
The lawyers nodded assent, and he continued:&#xD;
"Now the young man himself disclaims knowledge. of any&#xD;
writing which gives hiu the least claim upon the estate, on&#xD;
which, as next of kin, my son will administer. Is it notso, M-in&#xD;
Clement Spencer ?" .&#xD;
Clement tood silent and amazed. Looking alternately at&#xD;
those nm the room with him, as if anxious to ,haravel teisd&#xD;
thoughts, his blood coursed rapidly through his veins, his eyer&#xD;
glared, and he appeared like the incarnation of a thuud(er-cloud-&#xD;
" Speak out," gruffly exclaimed the elder Mr.. Spencer," or&#xD;
hold your peace forever! Did you not s:ty that you had no&#xD;
knowledge of the existence of any will ?"&#xD;
"I did,"answered Clement, his heart almost ready to burst&#xD;
with anger.yk&#xD;
" Well, sir," continued the old merchant, "although, as I be-&#xD;
fore remarked, you have made yourself a barrier between my&#xD;
deceased brother and his legitimate relatives, I harbor you no&#xD;

ill-wilI. You can remain In this house a few days, if you wish,&#xD;
and can take away what you probably regard as your own per-&#xD;
sonal effects.,,&#xD;
" What!" exclaimed Clement. "You give me permission to&#xD;
remain in the house where I have passed the most -of my life,&#xD;
cherished by its owner, who ever regarded you with contempt-&#xD;
--brother of his though you were!"&#xD;
" You hear this," blandly remarked the old merchant, appeal,&#xD;
ing to the lawyers. "You can tell the misguided young main&#xD;
too, what right he may have to remain here an-instant, without&#xD;
the permission of my son here, whois his uncle's administrator.&#xD;
" Catch me giving it to himi1" muttered young Spencer.&#xD;
"SilenceI1" Interpoed his father. "Let us hear what th&#xD;
young Man has to say now."&#xD;
"Sir," 'esponded Clement, in a voice that slightly trembled,&#xD;
yet was manly amidst emotion, "I suppose it is so,fnor will I&#xD;
remaain another night beneath this roof. You boast that, you&#xD;
have possession, but mark, the day of retribution wil come."&#xD;
"Hush, hush, young man I Don't be rash. My son and my-&#xD;
self will befriend you, and you have agood situation for hoprove-&#xD;
ment at West Point. I intend to remit you a hundred dollars&#xD;
per quarter until you graduate."&#xD;
"John Spencer," proudly replied the cadet, "I am almost a&#xD;
bear ; yet could I coin every copper of that hundred dollars&#xD;
nto a golden eagle, I would spurn it as I spurn it now."&#xD;
One of the lawyers, who had known Clement from boyhood,&#xD;
endeavored to expostulate with him, but in vain.&#xD;
" Never mind, sir," said he. "I am young, vigorous and capa-&#xD;
-ble of braving the world's sneers-at poverty. But the day may&#xD;

With these wordshe left the apartment, pahed up the few&#xD;

'CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
WEALTH VERSUS MERIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tim mansion of Mr. Patterson was the most magnificent in&#xD;
New York. FurniIshed in the most sumptuous manner with&#xD;
everything that wealth could supply, there was one room that&#xD;
gave especial evidence of a refined yet capricious taste. Occu-&#xD;
pying the entire front of the third story, its windows opened&#xD;
upon a balcony which overlooked the then fashionable Battery,&#xD;
and commanded a view of the magnificent harbor. Within, the&#xD;
windows were decorated with curtains of rose-colored damask&#xD;
and embroidered white muslin, while the walls were hung with&#xD;
a pearl-colored paper, studded with golden figures. The, Brus-&#xD;
sels carpet was so thick that io' footsteps on it could be heard;&#xD;
embroidered tapestries covered the luxuriously-cushioned&#xD;
lounges, and above the polished marble mantel was an immense&#xD;
French mirror. A few pencil sketches, in carved walnut frames,&#xD;
decked the walls; an inlaid bookcase was well filed with poetry&#xD;
and romance, and on a large centre-table was a confused mass of&#xD;
newspapers, ornamented needlework, periodicals, music, and the&#xD;
latest fashion-plates.&#xD;
It was Ida's boudoir; and as she sat there, turning over the&#xD;
pages of General Morris's "Mirror " (then in its glory), it ap.&#xD;
peaked a fit shrine for one so lovely. She wore a simple morn--&#xD;
ing-dress, and a tiny cap partially enclosed the masses of her hair,&#xD;
while on-a footstool reposed her tiny feet, which Cinderella&#xD;
would have envied., But those tiny feet beat impatiently, show..&#xD;
ing that she was ill at-ease, and her lips contracted into what&#xD;
might almost hive been called a pout. For the first time in her&#xD;
life, the petted favorite had been crossed in her wishes. Her&#xD;
father had taken her from West Point on the very morning that&#xD;
Element Spencer had left,-although they took different boats,&#xD;
and she had not received any answer to a tiny note which she&#xD;
had left for him. "Why," she thought, "has he taken no notice&#xD;
of it ?"&#xD;
The door was opened somewhat abruptly, and her father&#xD;
entered-an unusual honor. A stern, vexed frown was on his&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
countenance, and she knew before he spoke that he, toowas&#xD;
"out of sorts."&#xD;
"Ida," said he, energetically," I wish to have a talk with you."&#xD;
'Which you can have," was the reply. "Sit down here."&#xD;
"Ida, you are getting old."&#xD;
"Not old enough to wear glasses, though," said the unsus-&#xD;
pecting and light-hearted girl, with a merry laugh.&#xD;
"But old enough to marry, though, Ida, and I have a husband&#xD;
to propose to you. How would you like to be Mrs. Spencer.?"&#xD;
"Father!" ejaculated Ida, her cheek and brow burning.&#xD;
"Yes-Mrs. Spencer. I have received a letter this morning&#xD;
from old John Spencer (he's not much older than I am, though),&#xD;
in which he says that his son, young John, has inherited all the&#xD;
property of a deceased uncle, and is now worth a quarter of a&#xD;
million. This being the case, he asks me for your hand.''&#xD;
"What! John Spencerasks'my hand ?"&#xD;
"Yes I thinkhe is calculated to make you a good husband."&#xD;
"I marry John Spencer! Ha, ha, haI" Throwing her head&#xD;
back, the young girl, gave a nervous, metallic laugh, that echoed&#xD;
through the room.&#xD;
Nay, don't be so trifling, Ida."&#xD;
"Father," she exclaimed, her mouth contracted to a ruby ring,&#xD;
and her eyes dilated, "are you not jesting "&#xD;
"I never was more earnest in my life. He Is wealthy, well&#xD;
connected, and I think a good match."&#xD;
For a moment Ida's lips faltered, then the deep scarlet of her&#xD;
face died away in- a deeper pallor.&#xD;
"Can I write his father that you look with favor upon the&#xD;
proposition ?"&#xD;
"Jrather," said she, with an exertion that again brought the&#xD;
bright scarlet in a flood across her countenance, "I would rather&#xD;
die than marry that ignorant, vulgar wretch. That is my an-&#xD;
swer to-day, that would have been my answer yesterday, that&#xD;
will be my answer to-morrow-forever!"&#xD;
Never had Mr. P4tterson seen evidences of any such determined&#xD;
spirit in his daughter, and he gazed at her with astonishment.&#xD;
" You are rash, Idag," said he.,. " Why, half the girls in Ameri-&#xD;
ca would envy you, and-"&#xD;
" Father," exclaimed the excited girl, with flashing eye and&#xD;
dilated nostrils, " do not urge the matter ; it is useless 1"Then&#xD;
rising, she went before him, put one of. her tiny hands on each&#xD;

of his sallow cheeks, and kissed him again and again, saying&#xD;
between each salute, " No, no !"&#xD;
" You are yoir' poor mother's child," said Mr. Patterson, when&#xD;
this affectionate negative was at last concluded. "I must go&#xD;
down to Wall street now, but I hope when I return to-night to&#xD;
find you less obdurate."&#xD;
"Adieu! But you will not find me disposed to receive any&#xD;
attentions from John Spencer."&#xD;
No sooner had he closed the door behind him than she burst&#xD;
Into a flood of tears. Alas! why was it not Clement' who was&#xD;
)hus thrust upon her? .Her nature had an unusual degree of&#xD;
force, but somehow she now felt oppressed with a sense of sad-,&#xD;
ness. Well has it been asked if there Is not in the curious-&#xD;
mechanism of the human frame some hidden sense league in&#xD;
mysterious sympathy with his destiny; some subtle fluid within,&#xD;
which becomes agitated or congealed as the meshes of fate draw&#xD;
closely around; some sad presentiment, some vague foreknowl-&#xD;
edge of impending doom. Why else was Ida so wretched ?&#xD;
Why else did she fear an end to those pleasant dreams which&#xD;
for a week had made her so happy?&#xD;
While what Germans call "danger-shadow" was thus dark-&#xD;
ening the young girl's soul, she unconsciously approached a&#xD;
window, and gazing down into the street, saw-coulfP she be-&#xD;
lieve her eyes ?-Clemnent Spencer! Yes. On reaching New&#xD;
York, some magnetic influence had led him to seek out Mr.&#xD;
Patterson's residence, although he was not aware that Ida had&#xD;
returned from West Point. Passing slowly by, and gazing up&#xD;
At the windows as if envying them the privilege of meeting her&#xD;
gaze, he saw the loved features whose smile was sunlight to his&#xD;
elouded heart  Was It- a dream?  No. She saw him; she&#xD;
recognizeid'hi; she beckoned him to enter the house.&#xD;
The sign was iminediately understood, and ere Ida could fly'&#xD;
down stairs, greatly to the surprise of a fat serving-man, whom&#xD;
she nearly overturned, Clement rang the bell. The -door 'Was&#xD;
opened, and Ida herself, with a radiant look of joy lighting up&#xD;
her features, admitted him.&#xD;
But she could but start as she greeted him. But a few days&#xD;
had passed since she had se e'a in Clement Spencer a fresh, joy-.&#xD;

expression 6f content. Now, he stood before her paid an d hag-&#xD;

rowed -by those anxious lines that speak of sleepless nights and&#xD;
Troubled days.&#xD;
She ushered him into a drawing-room, where they sat down&#xD;
Eide by side, but for some moments neither spoke. She felt&#xD;
tha the still frost of disappointment was nipping the flowers of&#xD;
her love, and sat with questions quivering on her lip, yet not&#xD;
wishing to break the silence.&#xD;
IA Clement's heart, there was a wild struggle between pride&#xD;
and affection. His yearnings for the interchange of'pure affec-&#xD;
tion, rainpant and fierce, were only subdued by the thought that&#xD;
he was a beggar-that he had nothing to offer the heiress but a&#xD;
name coming from a hidden source. But he must speak.&#xD;
"Miss Patterson-Ida !" His pale lips quivered as though he&#xD;
would go on, but could not.&#xD;
"Clement," said she, fixing her candid eyes steadily on -his&#xD;
troubled countenance with an imploring glance of entreaty,&#xD;
"what has happened ?"&#xD;
"Happened! Alas, Ida-if I may so call you-I am a sad&#xD;
and heart-sick man. My dear godfather is dead, and I,, driven&#xD;
forth from his kind home as an outcast, feel a gulf opened&#xD;
between us'that-"&#xD;
"A gulf!" interrupted Ida, in tones of contempt. "Think&#xD;
you, Clement, that I care for gold-that I have ever thought of&#xD;
your father's wealth ?"&#xD;
"Alas !" exclaimed Clement, with the impetuosity of a generous&#xD;
heart, " he is not my father.- I am-"&#xD;
He was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of Mr. Patterson,&#xD;
his countenance clouded with furious anger. Striding up to&#xD;
Clement, who rose to his feet, he asked, sternly:&#xD;
"Beggar-scoundrel! what are you doing here ? What do&#xD;
you mean by stealing into my house like a thief?"&#xD;
Astonished at this abrupt greeting, Clement Spencer trembled&#xD;
from head to foot with emotion. But Ida, with alook of dignity&#xD;
that even awed the savage violence of her father, stood between&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"tFather," said she, in a calm voice, " Mr. Spencer came into&#xD;
this house at my invitation."&#xD;
" Invitation !" growled the infuriated parent. " Can you find&#xD;
no one to invite here but a'beggar 2"&#xD;
" Beggar !"~ repeated Clement Spencer, In a tone of anguish&#xD;
which seemed wrung from the depths of his sorrow-strickeu&#xD;

"Yes- - r!I Who ard you, anyhow ?     Who was your&#xD;
father ? W.Was your mother? What right had you to impose&#xD;
yourself on me and my daughter as the son of Clement Spence,&#xD;
of Coalboro'? Aha, you don't answer, you beggar!"&#xD;
A flush stole over the young man's pale face, and plide&#xD;
appeared to rise even above the deep agony of hissoul.&#xD;
"Mr. Patterson," said lie, mournfully, yet with decision,&#xD;
" you gain nothing by heaping insults. upon a bruised heart.&#xD;
I did not seek this interview, and I only was improving it to&#xD;
explain to Miss Patterson the dark cloud which hangs over my&#xD;
parentage, a cloud which-"&#xD;
"Which filddlestick !" interrupted Mr. Patterson, stamping&#xD;
upon the carpet in his rage. "Now clear out from here, and if&#xD;
you ever darken these doors again, you beggar, I will have you&#xD;
sent to Blackwell's Island like a thief!"&#xD;
Clement Spencer, as he turned toward the door, cast a glance&#xD;
of mute appeal toward Ida. It reached her heart, and with a j&#xD;
Llush of glowing crimson mantling her cheek, she, with a bound,&#xD;
clasped the young man around the neck, exclaiming:&#xD;
Heaven bless you, dear Cleutent! Remember, I am yours!"&#xD;
With a loud oath, and clenched fist, the infuriated father strode&#xD;
toward the love-locked pair. But ere lie reached them, Clement&#xD;
Spencer had with a spasmodic effort wound his arms around&#xD;
Ida, whispering, "Forever-forever !" Then, loosening himself&#xD;
from her embrace, he confronted Mr. Patterson, saying:&#xD;
Do not forget sir, that I am a cadet and a gentleman."&#xD;
The man of money cowered before the man of mind, and the&#xD;
clenched hand was opened.&#xD;
I don't wish- to hurt your feelings, young man," growled Mr.&#xD;
Patterson, "but John Spencer has written me all about you,&#xD;
and that foolish girl will yet marry his son. You may be smart,&#xD;
but young John will have the dimes, and that's the great staff&#xD;
of life, yoqu know. Anyhow,.as you claim to be a cadet and a&#xD;
gentleman, I hope you will never enter this house again without&#xD;
my consent."~&#xD;
"Never fear, sir," replied Clement, with a kindling eye,'and&#xD;
in a stern tone. " I shall not soon forget tlis interview." Then&#xD;
lowering his voice, and turning towards Ida with a respectful&#xD;
obeisance, he continued: " No-I shall never forget it."&#xD;
He left' the room and the house with. a firm step, and a cold,&#xD;
proud brow, but the whirlwind of agony swept in bitter wails8&#xD;
over the tightly-drawn strimgs of his heart.&#xD;

Ida, with a lookof bitter anguish at her father, swept up stairs,&#xD;
and soon the feverish lush of excitement sank 'into the zero-&#xD;
like wretchedness of disappointment. Alone with her own&#xD;
agony, she felt dispirited and depressed, yet within her heart-&#xD;
a blessed talisman-was the love she bore Clement Spencer.&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
TEMPTATION.&#xD;
ABOUT a mile from West Point, on a narrow lane, which led&#xD;
along the very bank of the river, was' a large brick house,&#xD;
originally built for a hotel, although the sign no longer creaked&#xD;
from the gibbet-like post in front. Strangers who passed during&#xD;
the day, and looked into the windows of the first floor (where&#xD;
they could see some common furniture through the accumulated&#xD;
dust on the window panes), would have supposed the house to&#xD;
be inhabited, though by persons who were unusually indifferent&#xD;
to the comforts of order and cleanliness. If they passed again&#xD;
late at night, and happened to look-up once more at the dreary&#xD;
Mansion, and then saw faint gleams of light struggling through&#xD;
the closed shutters of the upper windows, the thought might&#xD;
arise that in that upper chamber the wakeful eye of the invalid&#xD;
found, companionship in the feeble ray of the night-lamp. -But&#xD;
if any feeling of Ouriosity prompted an inquiry among the dis-&#xD;
tant neighbors as to who dwelt in, that forlorn-looking place,&#xD;
an evasive reply was sure to be given. What might have been&#xD;
their real opinions, they were kept back by, the recollections of&#xD;
the generous prices paid there for game. fruit, eggs and butter.&#xD;
The occupant' of this somewhat mysterious dwelling-fainil-&#xD;
larly known as Jemmy Ryan-had the air and appearance of&#xD;
one formed for action, yet partially enslaved by sensuality. He&#xD;
was of no more than a middling stature, but a vigorous muscu-&#xD;
lar development promised a more than ordinary strength, while&#xD;
in his gestures there was a decision which no advantage of&#xD;
stature could bestow. There was .no clue to his: age. The&#xD;
anxious expressionl might have gathered on his ill-favored coun-&#xD;
tenance during the phases of thirty years of adventurous life;&#xD;
a vigorous constitution and a mind not ovrer-sensitive to trouble&#xD;

THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Was a bleached -carroty red, andthere. was -a brazen look about,&#xD;
his blood-shot, fiery eyes, betokening little good yin the heart of'&#xD;
which they were the windows-&#xD;
Some of the good. people in those parts declared that he had&#xD;
been a clergyman, and had fallen from grace; others felt coif1-&#xD;
dent that he had been a pirate; and others shook their heads&#xD;
mysteriously when his name was mentioned. But the cadets&#xD;
knew him as a caterer for their pleasures. Did a party of them&#xD;
wish to enjoy a rollicking supper, and too pss the rest of the&#xD;
night at the gaming-table, Jemmy Ryan's was the place to visit.&#xD;
One of the most constant frequenters of the establishment&#xD;
was a cadet from the then half-civilized West, who had been&#xD;
classic'ally christened Demosthenes, and whose paternal naibe&#xD;
was Jones. One of the oldest at the institution, he was tall and&#xD;
large; his features were repulsive, and he showed personal indi-&#xD;
cations of a disposition to vicious idulgence in the use of&#xD;
ardent spirits,&#xD;
Late in the day, after the scene at Mr. Patterson's, this worthy&#xD;
was striding to and -fro at Ryan's, with contracted brow .and&#xD;
unsteady step. The master of the establishment was in the&#xD;
room, and sat watching him with tiger-like eagerness. At&#xD;
length he thought the time had arrived, and broke the silence-&#xD;
"Well," he asked, "how does Squire Jones mean to propel ?"&#xD;
"Propel!" repeated the cadet, with a shudder. "-What can I&#xD;
do ?"&#xD;
"Stump the flimsies," -was the reply; "square the chink."&#xD;
"1Pay up, I suppose you mean, in. your infernal slang. I wish&#xD;
I could. I wish I had never seen this den-never met that&#xD;
smooth-tongued New Yorker, confound him!"-&#xD;
"Never," continued Ryan, with sarcastic coolness-" never&#xD;
have scribbled a promise for five hundred dollars which you&#xD;
cannot stump up! Isn't It so, SquireJones ?"&#xD;
"1I thought I could pay It."&#xD;
"Thought's a bad master, Squire Jones.".&#xD;
"But what can'I do ?"&#xD;
" Pay up."&#xD;
"And how ?"&#xD;
" Ha, ha!I" laughed Ryan. " Here's ,a go! You had a time,&#xD;
borrowed the rollers, scribbled your promise, and. now ask poor&#xD;
old Jemmy Ryan how to pay up. You owe me afew ~'s, too,&#xD;
my 'fine fellow."&#xD;

"Not much. The promise Is In the Newburg Bank,;it will&#xD;

"I would sooner diel"&#xD;
"That's plucky."&#xD;
" But:what can I do"&#xD;
"Borrow."&#xD;
"Who of?"&#xD;
"Any one. Try Clem Spencer." As he spoke, Ryan peered&#xD;
from beneath his shaggy e-yebrows,-to ascertain the- result- of&#xD;
this carelessly-uttered but well-aimed remark.&#xD;
"Clem Spencer !" exclaimed the cadet,stopping in his walk-&#xD;
",Clem Spencer ! Have you forgotten how, the rascal meddled&#xD;
with my flirtation with. the daughter of old Rawson, at Cold&#xD;
Spring? And then, only a week or so ago, did he not snub&#xD;
Count Discount because the poor little fellow witnessed a love-&#xD;
scene between the Immaculate and that Patterson girl? Why,&#xD;
lie talked to-Wilkinson as though he was but a-dog."&#xD;
"Yes," scornfully replied Ryan; "and he would have treated&#xD;
you in exactly the same way."&#xD;
"He! Clem Spencer dare lay his hand on meI" cried Jones,&#xD;
with the ferocity of aroused anger. "1 ,have half a mind toinsult&#xD;
and whip the coxcomb, at any rate,"&#xD;
"He's rich, and you do not dare touch him."&#xD;
"Not dare ! Why, I would thrash his life out of him for a&#xD;
tottle ofchampagne."-&#xD;
"Sit down. I wish to make a proposition."&#xD;
Jones looked at Ryan for a moment, as if vaguely suspecting&#xD;
that something wrong was on foot, but he took a chair and sat&#xD;
down.&#xD;
"Squire Jones," said Ryan, " I know a man who will put the&#xD;
Yellow boys into your hands to pay that note with, if you will&#xD;
.in suit that aristocrat, call him out,.and wing him. You are a&#xD;
dead shot, and can easily draw his claret without slipping. his&#xD;
wind."&#xD;
" But if I kill him ?"&#xD;
" Bah ! Honestly, I don't believe he dares stand fire, and the&#xD;
game is to make him show the white-feather."&#xD;
" Should I murder him, though ?" muttered Jones.&#xD;

' Nerd."&#xD;
"What, you, Jenmy Ryan ?"&#xD;
"Yes. I am only an agent, though."&#xD;
",But the money-who has fhe money?"&#xD;
"I have." Taking out a leathern putse, in which clinked&#xD;
gold with its unmistakable sound, he tossed it toward Jones,&#xD;
saying: "There it is-all right. Now   take a, glass of&#xD;
champagne."0&#xD;
"No, no!" exclaimed the -cadet, a livid pallor overspreading&#xD;
.his countenance. " Iwant brandy-strong, potent brandy! Ha,&#xD;
ha! my note is paid. Brantdy, old fellow-brandy!"&#xD;
Ryan produced a bottle, from which he poured forth two&#xD;
copious libations. One of these the cadet clutched, and poured it&#xD;
down his throat until not a drop was left in the glass. It made his&#xD;
eyes gleam with fire, and with a smile of bitter -satisfaction on&#xD;
his lips, he commenced pitching up and catching the purse of&#xD;
gold.&#xD;
"You have made more to-night than any of the covies up&#xD;
stairs have," said Ryan, putting away the bottle.&#xD;
"What!" eagerly inquired Jones. "Is there any playing&#xD;
going on up stairs ?"&#xD;
"You'd better believe there is-rouge et noir at that, and a&#xD;
rich bank to break. That New York fellow is here again."&#xD;
"Ah! I can perhaps win back the amount of my note.."&#xD;
" Why not try? Come, let's take another swig."~&#xD;
Again did the wily emissary of crime hand a glass of brandy&#xD;
to the young man, and again did he pour down the fiery draught.&#xD;
Then, maddened with the potations- and with excitement, he&#xD;
hastened up stairs.&#xD;
There; everything had a fascinating look of comfort and splen-&#xD;
dor. Costly draperies, richly gilded picture frames, and furni-&#xD;
ture fit for a palace (although -rather the worse for wear), pre-&#xD;
sented a different appearance from the roonis below. The d&amp;amp;i-&#xD;
gravings on the wall represented in glowing colors some objec-&#xD;
tionable scenes of heathen mythology, and in a book-case were&#xD;
well-thumbed editions of Paul de Kock's first publications, then&#xD;
as novel as they were immoral.&#xD;
At least a score sat around the table, not a quarter of them&#xD;
wearing the cadet uniform, and all absorbed in the game. The&#xD;
banker smiled as he saw his new victim enter, for it. was for him,&#xD;
and him alone, that the whole affair had been' arranged., Those&#xD;
'present might either lose or win a few hundred dollars, but the&#xD;
&#xD;
)&#xD;
&#xD;
with a meaning look.&#xD;
"A word with you, sir," said the banker, ere the agonized&#xD;
&#xD;
x&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WEST POINT CADET.               55&#xD;
game, after all, was to bring the now half-intoxicated Demos-&#xD;
thenes Jones to participate.&#xD;
The banker-the spider in the midst of this web of crime,&#xD;
though carefully disguised with false, whiskers,a well-curled&#xD;
wig and green glasses-was none other than Professor Pike.&#xD;
Who, to have seen him there smiling'and jesting as he welcomed&#xD;
Jones to a seat, would have thought that for weeks he had been&#xD;
-laying a deep plot of villany, and that this was another step&#xD;
accomplished?&#xD;
"Do you take your. revenge, Mr. Jones ?" asked the.wily&#xD;
banker (there known as Mr. Thompson), with a quiet smile.&#xD;
For a moment the young man hesitated, but the sight of&#xD;
various sums placed upon the table by those around. him, had&#xD;
the effect of inciting him, and he drew out the leather purse.&#xD;
The circle gazed at this evidence of prosperity with sonje inter-&#xD;
est, and in a few moments he was betting wildly.&#xD;
Thompson, or rather Pike, saw with joy that the spell of en-&#xD;
chantment was upon his victim, and for a time the young man&#xD;
was a constant winner.&#xD;
"Really, Mr. Jones," said he, In gentle tones, "I shall soon be&#xD;
forced to offer you my note; the tables are turned since we last&#xD;
tempted fortune together."&#xD;
"Play on-play on!" exclaimed Jones, and staked his every&#xD;
dollar on the game. .A flush of triumph mantled his cheek as&#xD;
he won.&#xD;
" Really," said the wily banker, striking the tale, " you&#xD;
intend to ruin me."&#xD;
But at the next deal the luck changed. Little by little the&#xD;
young gamesters found their funds making their way into the&#xD;
banker's hand, yet they hoped and played on.- One by one they&#xD;
left, penniless, and stood silent spectators, until Jones alone&#xD;
fought the demon of play. The struggle was apparently aii&#xD;
equal one, for exclamations of joy or disappointment were heard&#xD;
on either hand. But at last the infatuated cadet-sat 'with his&#xD;
.eyes fixed in heart-broken gaze at his last eagle,.as it was swept&#xD;
up by the banker, leaving nothing in xchange but misery and&#xD;
despair.&#xD;
" Come, Demosthenes, you unlucky old Roman !" exclaimed&#xD;
-one of his comrades :." we must hurry back to barracks."&#xD;
"Don't- you want to send to Newburg ?" asked. Jemmy Ryan,&#xD;

hundred dollars again, and send Ryan with it to pay your note.&#xD;
You now owe mne that sum."&#xD;
But how can I pay you ?" asked Jones, as they were leaving&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
"Do as Ryan directed you," hissed the disguised Professor&#xD;
Pike into his ear.&#xD;
The conscience-stricken victim started, and: as he mechani-&#xD;
cally followed his comrades, his very life appeared bound; up in&#xD;
the existence of some dreadful thought.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
PROVOCATION AND ASSAULT.&#xD;
EVIL tidings travel swiftly. Hardly had Clement Spencer&#xD;
returned to West Point, when the most astounding stories con-&#xD;
cerning him were put into circulation.. At first they were mere&#xD;
\runiors, which circulated from barrack to barrack, like a drop&#xD;
of oil which, though hardly perceptible at first, soon sullies the&#xD;
whole fabric upon'which it has fallen. Rimors casting discredit'&#xD;
upon his parentage soon grew bolder, and finally fortified them-&#xD;
selves by corroborating circumstances, each more injurious&#xD;
than its predecessor.'&#xD;
For some days, Clement was too much absorbed in his own&#xD;
griefs to notice the cool glances of those with whom he had&#xD;
previously been on familiar terms. He had lost his kind god-&#xD;
father, and the world. was but a dreary waste-only illumined&#xD;
by the prospect that he might yet enjoy the love of his cherished&#xD;
Ida. During the day he was to a great extent absorbed- in his&#xD;
studies, but long and restless were his nights. The pillow&#xD;
brought no relief to his aching head; his bed was like a bed of&#xD;
thorns; sleep refused to visit his eyelids, and night was but a&#xD;
seasoif of agony. Sometimes he would start up and wonder if-&#xD;
the events of the past month were not a terrible dream; then he&#xD;
would endeavor to philosophize on his ill fate, and then he would&#xD;
find the voice of reason drowned in the still deep voice of utter .&#xD;
despair.&#xD;
While others who had professed to be Clement's friends de-&#xD;
5orted him in this hour of heart-trial, and were among the fore-&#xD;

most around the anatomical table of public opinion, where his&#xD;
history was so pitilessly dissected, Clayton remained steadfast.&#xD;
True, Clement's life was to his friend an enigma, but he did not&#xD;
seek to unravel it. Nay, he endeavored to prevent the pestilen-&#xD;
tial breath of slander from reaching him, and from festering in&#xD;
a heart already wounded to the very core. Above all,he believed&#xD;
Clement Spencer to be an honorable, abused and slandered na.&#xD;
A week-passed slowly along, and Clement Spencer-could bnt&#xD;
see the coolness with which every one, save Clayton, treated&#xD;
him. Why was he thus ostracised from society he did not ask,&#xD;
but naturally came to the conclusion that it was owing to tie&#xD;
change in his pecuniary prospects. This wounded him the&#xD;
more, and as he avoided societylehis traducers asserted that lie&#xD;
virtually confessed the truth of tleir allegations.&#xD;
Nor was there a morning or an evening parade at which the&#xD;
unfortunate -Jones-did not see Je-mmy Ryan, who would gaze at&#xD;
him with an inquiring glance, as if to ask, "Why do you not&#xD;
earn your money ?"&#xD;
The time came at length. One evening, Clayton being on&#xD;
guard, Clement slipped quietly down to Kosiusko's'kgarden, the&#xD;
scene of his heart-confession. Sitting on the bench, loet in&#xD;
dreamyreverie, the shades of night drew in, and he did not&#xD;
notice the arrival of a party of cadets, until they were close -by&#xD;
him. Was it his own name that met his ear ?&#xD;
"Yes, gentlemen," said Jones who was speakitg,-" and this&#xD;
disgrace of his birth is not all. You remember how Wilkinson,&#xD;
that New Yorker who was up hereginsulted him? Well, Wik-&#xD;
inson sent him a challenge, but he was so cowardly as to refuse&#xD;
it. So much for Clem Spencer's honor."&#xD;
Rising to his feet, Spencer stepped quickly before the speaker.&#xD;
"Sir," said he, "do you allude to me ?"&#xD;
"Listeners hear no good of themselves," was the sneering&#xD;
remark of Jones.&#xD;
" Sir" replied Spencer, "I was seated here when you came&#xD;
along, and when I heard my own name,, I had a right, to- listen&#xD;
to those who used it."&#xD;
" I hope you are satisfied."&#xD;
" I am satisfied, Mr. Jbnes, that you, in repeating slanderous&#xD;
falsehoods, coupled an opprobrious epithet with my name."&#xD;
" Cowardly was the word I used," said .Jones, in, the most&#xD;
contemptuous manner, " and I now repeat it."&#xD;
"Applying it to me 2"&#xD;

To you, Clem Spencer or to any other coward I"&#xD;
The others, who had listened in breathless astonishment,&#xD;
turned toward Spencer; but he stood calm and colleeted-&#xD;
"iWhen you have digested this insult," continued Jones,&#xD;
encouraged by the silence of Spencer, " I have another ready."&#xD;
"Mr. Jones," replied Spencer, with coolness, "I am at a loss&#xD;
to know whether yon are crazy or drunk."&#xD;
Incensed to madness, Jones' drew himself up, and spat con-&#xD;
temptuously at.Spencer.&#xD;
"This," said Spencer, "is unbearable. Gentlemen, I have&#xD;
considered this young man deranged; but if he is sane, I can be&#xD;
found at.the guard-house, where my friend Clayton will make&#xD;
necessary arrangements. After such an insult as you have&#xD;
witnessed, if this man'is not lisane, one of us should no longer&#xD;
live."&#xD;
He turned away, and walked slowly to the guard-house, where&#xD;
he confided what had happened to his friend.&#xD;
" Spencer," said the noble-hearted Clayton, when he had heard&#xD;
the recital, " I tell you frankly that you have secret enenies&#xD;
about here; who are using every means to blacken your name&#xD;
and your parentage. This fellow must be put forward as their&#xD;
champion, and the sooner you meet him the better."&#xD;
"I am ready, Clayton. A mystery appears to enshroud me,&#xD;
and the quicker I can penetrate it the better, as you say."&#xD;
"Good! Now go-to your quarters, and endeavor to get some&#xD;
sleep. I will get some one to take my place, so as to get away,&#xD;
and we will have a meeting down by Jemmy Ryan's, at day-&#xD;
break."&#xD;
"Ah, Clayton, you are a friend indeed !" said Spencer, who&#xD;
felt that he was indeed the victim to some conspiracy against&#xD;
him. "Come over when the arrangements are made."&#xD;
Returning to his quarters, Clement wrote to Ida, and then&#xD;
the thought occurred to him that Mr. Ledroit had ever taken a&#xD;
warm interest in his welfare.' So he also wrote to him, and just&#xD;
as he had concluded the letter, which was a recital of the recent&#xD;
sad events in which he had been an actor, Clayton entered the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"All Is arranged," said he. " You are to meet, with pistols,&#xD;
in the glen between here and Jemmy Ryan's, where the old iron&#xD;
forge IS. I insisted, also, that we go separately, as in that case&#xD;
it will be easier to pass the guard, and no suspicions will beo&#xD;
excited. Now take your pistols-I think you have a'pair-and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
come over to my quarters. You can sleep better. there than&#xD;
here, anA sleep -you must."&#xD;
spencer did exactly what his friend requested him to do, and&#xD;
in half an hour was occupying Clayton's cot, while, its owner&#xD;
went elsewhere. say, he fell asleep, and after troubled dreams,&#xD;
was, awakened by Clayton.&#xD;
" Up upI" said he. "I have overslept myself, and we are&#xD;
late. But I will hasten to the rendezvous, and you can follow."&#xD;
AsSpencer was dressing, he remembered that he had. left the&#xD;
letters.which he had wrote the evening previous on his table in&#xD;
his own quarters, and he determined -to go for them, feeling&#xD;
certain that he could overtake Clayton, or reach the rendezvou a&#xD;
a very few moments after him.&#xD;
On reaching the door of the room, however, he saw, to his.&#xD;
surprise, a light within, visible through the cracks. He had&#xD;
locked it on leaving, and the' key was in his pocket, yet the&#xD;
sound of footsteps within plainly met his ear, and on applying&#xD;
his key, ei found that another was in the lock, on the inside.&#xD;
It then flashed across his mind that a long ladder, which had&#xD;
been used for some repairs, was standing. on the outside of the&#xD;
building. Hastening out to it, he cautiously moved it, until ,it&#xD;
rested on the sill of his window, and then ascended.&#xD;
Was it possible? Yes. There sat the unknown stranger&#xD;
who had so tantalized him ab out his parentage at the gambling-&#xD;
house in New York, eagerly inspecting the papers in his writing.-&#xD;
desk, while on the table lay, open, the veryletters for which he,&#xD;
came,.which he had leftcarefully sealed. Seizing the window,&#xD;
he endeavored to throw it up, but It was fastened within, and&#xD;
the noise attracted the attention of the inquisitor. No sooner&#xD;
did he see Spencer's angry face through the glass, than with a&#xD;
spring he unlocked the door and fled. When at last the window&#xD;
yielded to the powerful attack upon its fastening, and the occu-&#xD;
pant of the room sprang In, he found himself alone..&#xD;
It Was evident, 'however, that his desk had been carefully ex-&#xD;

then he began to collect the opened papers on the table; but&#xD;

Hastily re-folding the letters to Ida Patterson and Mr. Ledroit,&#xD;
he left the room and the building, lost in conj ecture. as to. this&#xD;

Day had not dawned,.and-slipping..past the sentries, Clepnent&#xD;
Spencer hastened to the rendezvous. The path led through the&#xD;
woods; nor had he gone far, when he tripped over sone obstacle&#xD;
and fell to the0ground, striking his-head against a tree. ' A faint--&#xD;
ness caine over him, and he lay insensible.&#xD;
When he again became conscious, it seemed to him that he&#xD;
had awoke from-a disturbed and painful dream; but when he&#xD;
endeavored to sit up .in his bed, he sank back, feeble and ex-&#xD;
hausted. Where was he? In'a large room, the blinds of-which&#xD;
were closed, but of which he had no recollection.' It was, her&#xD;
could see by the faint light which made its way in, plainly! fur--&#xD;

he must have been-nay, he then was very ill, and in Vain did&#xD;
he endeavor to disentangle his confused btain. from the visions&#xD;
which floated through- it. Soon, wearied even witr. thought&#xD;
he slept again.&#xD;
The noise made by opening the door aWoke him, and-looking&#xD;
up, he recognized his friend Clayton, who hastened ontiptoe,&#xD;
to his' bedside.&#xD;
"My poor Clem,' said he, "how do you feel to-day ?".&#xD;
"- Tell me, Clayton," said he, "where am I?"&#xD;
"Safe so far," was the. reply. "But you must keep quiet.n&#xD;
Spencer protested, however, that he felt able to hear anything&#xD;
concerning himself; and Clayton, seating himself at the bedside;&#xD;
made this narration:                               .&#xD;
"On leaving you, Clem, I hastened to the place of'rendezvousi&#xD;
but found no one there. Lighting a cigar, I was pacing to and&#xD;
fro, when I plainly heard the report of a pistol, iii the direction&#xD;
6f the barracks.. Hastening thither, I met McLean, who was to&#xD;
act as second to Jones, supporting him, and endeavoring to get&#xD;
him along. He had been fired at, Clemi and *odnded in the&#xD;
leg*&#xD;
By whom?" asked Spencer.&#xD;
" Not by you, my dear fellow; your manner prbves it. But&#xD;

A DOUBLE ESCAPE.&#xD;

YOUTH and a strong constitution triumphed, yet It was a&#xD;
severe struggle. For ten never-ending days and as many long&#xD;
nights of agony, did Clement'Spencer toss restlessly about on&#xD;
his feverish pillow, his brow corrugated with the pangs of deli-&#xD;
'rium: Carefully did Clayton watch by his bedside,:ministering to&#xD;
his wants with that kindness soiprecious -to the suffering invalid.&#xD;
The crisis came and was past. One mornng, Clement awoke&#xD;
with, aconsciousness that his mind was free from the visions&#xD;
which had haunted it, and although very feeble, he felt confl-&#xD;
d&amp;amp;nce in the doctor's assertion that he would slowly recover.&#xD;
He was forbidden to speak, however, even to his devoted friend&#xD;
Clayton, and for a few long days more he layhii a passive drow-&#xD;
siness, lost in the sad maze of his own thoughts. Indeed, as he&#xD;
lay dreaming of the future, it seemed at times a matter of regret&#xD;
that Providence had pernitted him so recover, for he had recol-&#xD;
lections of glimpses of a glorious existence beyond the lomb-&#xD;
portals at which he had lingered. Itwasreplete with bright-&#xD;
ness and-glory, and radiant with the brilhant  es of revelation,&#xD;
while everything around was full of dark sha ows- and soul-&#xD;
crushing sorrows. His parentage Was anipene able enigma,&#xD;
and an evil geniis had of late appeared to hurr blin to ruin.&#xD;
A blighting penury was blasting his once bri iant prospects;&#xD;
and now that he was poor and friendless, he w s accused of a&#xD;
crime at which his heart revolted. Nay-love o Ida Patterson,&#xD;

nearest shelter, andlhere you had better remain for the present.&#xD;
To speak frankly, Clem, your room was found in great disorder.&#xD;
and I believe that coward Jones has brought' the case before&#xD;
the grand jury. While in your present condition, no arrest&#xD;
could be made, 'and, meanwhile,,keep quiet. All will come out&#xD;
rightly in the end, and let me assure you that you do not lark&#xD;
friends. Now good-day. Don't be discouraged, but get strong&#xD;
as soon as you can."&#xD;
It was more than the invalid could bear-t]gat news of. fresh&#xD;
suspicion, and that night he was again in the struggling delirium&#xD;
of a brain fever.&#xD;

&#xD;
that blessed talisman which would'enable him to breast the&#xD;
stormy waves of trouble, was also denied him. His thirsty&#xD;
heart was not to drink of its sweetness in the desert of affliction,&#xD;
and no bright star of light illumed the darkness of the future.&#xD;
Clayton was his only comfort, and when he was permitted to&#xD;
converse, it gladdened his sorrow-stricken heart to find that his,&#xD;
friend turned a deaf ear to the charges against him. Yet he&#xD;
.was informed, with due caution, that appearances were strong&#xD;
against him, and, that Jones was earnest in his desires for&#xD;
revenge.&#xD;
One niorning, Clayton went to West Point, to obtain some&#xD;
articles of wearing apparel, and returned accompanied by Pro-&#xD;
fessor Pike. Clement had not seen this worthy (undisguised)&#xD;
for some time, but was haunted by the thought that he had&#xD;
been with him during his illness.&#xD;
"Clem," said Clayton, after. the introduction, "do you feel&#xD;
strong enough to go out of doors ?"&#xD;
"Yes; I wished to go out yesterday, you know, but had&#xD;
nothing to put on."&#xD;
"Mr. Spencer," said Professor Pike, "we have bad news for&#xD;
you. First let me tell youfgat Mr. John Spencer commissioned-&#xD;
me, the instant he learned of this unhappy affair, to come here&#xD;
and render' you what aid I could.- Mr. Clayton will bear me&#xD;
witness' that I have done all that I could to second his noble&#xD;
exertions in your behalf."&#xD;
"1That he has, Clem-that he has !" exclaimed Clayton, who&#xD;
noticed a cloud of displeasure gathering on his friend's face.&#xD;
"I have done my duty,". meekly continued the professor.&#xD;
"And now comes a disagreeable task. - We, Mr. Spencer, do not&#xD;
believe you guilty of this foul charge made against you, but the&#xD;
public think differently.  There is strong circumstantial evi-&#xD;
dence that you were at your quarters in a state of great excite-&#xD;
ment-that you took your pistols-that your adiversary wasshot&#xD;
at from some one who came stealthily from behind-and that&#xD;
you. were soon after found near there, lying in 'a position that,&#xD;
would.justify a belief that after firing you sought to escape, but&#xD;
accidentally fell."                                N&#xD;
As this chain of evidence was unravelled, Clement's sunken .&#xD;
eyes. appeared full of a deeper sorrow than is ever lightened by .&#xD;
tears. The only thing that indicated life or emotion, was a con-&#xD;
vulsive quivering of his pale lips, and when he endeavored to -&#xD;
speak, his voice appeared to falter.&#xD;
&#xD;
4-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"But can It be believed ?" he at length faltered forth.&#xD;
"Alas!1" replied Clayton, "it will be."&#xD;
"I am ready for trial !" exclaimed Clement, without the faint-&#xD;
est blush of shame upon his emaciated countenance.&#xD;
"No, np," said Clayton; "it would be madness to do so now,&#xD;
and thus encounter the malignancy of that rascal Jones."&#xD;
"1Of course it would," chimed in the smooth-tongued professor.&#xD;
"No; Mr. Spencer must quietly leave, and remain away until&#xD;
these suspicions can be cleared up."&#xD;
"What! I fly? I become a hunted fugitive ?"&#xD;
"No, my dear Clem," answered Clayton., "Justice has not&#xD;
as yet claimed you, although I fear, she will soon be looking for&#xD;
you. But if you value yourself, your friends, or the memory of&#xD;
your godfather, do not become the victim  of this rascal8&#xD;
revenge."&#xD;
"But my honor !" exclaimed the unhappy young man, in a&#xD;
tone of deep feeling.&#xD;
Leaning forward, until he could whisper In his ear, the pro-&#xD;
fessor pronounced one word. It was the magical name of her&#xD;
he loved, and the thought that his very arrest (innocent though&#xD;
he might prove'himself) would but cloud her thoughts of him,&#xD;
had the desired effect.&#xD;
"But where can I go ?" he asked.&#xD;
"Professor Pike will attend to that," said Clayton, "and I&#xD;
hope you will stand the fatigue of the journey."&#xD;
Before the astonished invalid could fairly understand his posi-&#xD;
tion, he was up, shaved and dressed by the -care of Clayton.&#xD;
There was a crimson spot on each pale cheek, and his eyes&#xD;
began to sparkle feverishly from the excitement, but he felt&#xD;
stronger than he had anticipated. A carriage was at the door,&#xD;
and with many affectionate farewells. to the devoted Clayton,&#xD;
Clement Spencer started for New York at a rapid pace. Faint-&#xD;
hearted after so many disappointments, he feared that his inno-&#xD;
cence would not save him from the ignominy of a public trial,&#xD;
perhaps followed by imprisonment as a felon, and the ready&#xD;
means of escape offered could not be refused.&#xD;
That night they arrived at New,~York, and Clement found&#xD;
himself the inmate of a miserable room in the upper part of the&#xD;
city, where he remained for nearly a week, without venturing&#xD;
out of doors. Indeed, he felt so exhausted after the ride 'that&#xD;
he had little desire to move or even to think. '   -&#xD;

with him Clayton, who was, welcomed by.Spencer with heartfelt&#xD;
joy.'&#xD;
"But how," he asked,1" did you get a furlough ?"&#xD;
"Let me tell you, Clem. flow much better you look, bythe&#xD;
way ! Well, it was a great thing that you, started when you&#xD;
did, for the very .next morning that rascally Jones went to&#xD;
Newburg, got a sheriff's posse, and went to have you arrested.&#xD;
Bad as matters looked, many of yourold friends rebelled at this,&#xD;
and would have gone down to rescue' you, but I gave them a&#xD;
hint that there would be no writ served-on you that day. Sure&#xD;
enough, back came the great Demosthenes, swearing like a&#xD;
pirate. His bird had flown, and he is saddled with a round bill&#xD;
of costs. The next morning the old colonel sent for me, and&#xD;
although it would not be proper for the. head -of the military&#xD;
academy to wink at the escape of a cadet charged with a-critne,&#xD;
he is rLot sorry, I assure, you. Nay, you see- 1: have a furlough&#xD;
to come and see you sail.&#xD;
"Sail ?" inquired Clement.&#xD;
"Yes. Have you not posted him up, professor ?"&#xD;
"No, sir. I thought it best to see you here first, for you know&#xD;
that Mr. Spencer is not very tractable."&#xD;
"Well, Clem, some friends of yours have paid your passage&#xD;
to India, where you can easily obtain a situation with the letters&#xD;
we can give you. In a few years you, can obtain a competence,&#xD;
and before that arrives, old fellow, I hope to see your innocence&#xD;
clearly established."&#xD;
"God bless you!". was the only reply of the heart-stricken&#xD;
young man. Indeed he watebed, with almost vacant indiffer-&#xD;
ence, the preparations for his departure, and the blue hills of&#xD;
NeverAink were fast sinking beneath the horizon ere he was&#xD;
fully conscious that he had left his native land, a heart-broken&#xD;
exile.  Then, clear, as thej tnes. of a' silver trumpet, came&#xD;
thoughts of Ila Patterson, and, proud ,bopes that he might yet&#xD;
stand before her, free from suspicion,:and worthy-of -her love.&#xD;
Clement found that be had seven fellow-passengers,all bound&#xD;
for Calcutta, and all professing to be ggod sailors, although it&#xD;
was some days before~ they appeared at table. Navigation was&#xD;
their hobby, and they wbuld glibly criticise the ailing of the&#xD;
vessel when the captain was not withiA hearing, or discuss-the&#xD;
probable length of the voyage, in a manner which showed a&#xD;
knowledge of " wind currents " not since attained by Lie~ut.&#xD;
Maury. To the young exile their conversation presented little&#xD;

waste of waters.&#xD;

attractions, and as he kept aloo'from them, they-soon joined in&#xD;
disliking .him.&#xD;
The weather was delightful until they approached the tropics,&#xD;
when the porpoises began to gambol around the vessel, and it&#xD;
was evident that. stormy weather, was at hand. One night:the&#xD;
sun went. down- behind a heavy cloud, the horizon grew black,.&#xD;
and soon livid lightning was welcomed to the stormy scene by&#xD;
the sonorous roll of pealing thunder.. The rain began to pour&#xD;
down, and while the crew laid..aloft to get. in sail, amidst the&#xD;
vociferations of the officers, the passengers sought refuge in&#xD;
the cabin.&#xD;
"I say," said one of the young men, "listen to what I have&#xD;
found in a newspaper which was wrapped around my oil-cloth&#xD;
cape."' He then read:&#xD;
GREAT EXCITEMENT, we learn, prevails at West Point, a&#xD;
student of the academy having been shot by a fellow-cadet, with&#xD;
whom he was to fight a duel. Singularly enough, the- would-&#xD;
be-assassin was arrested in his flight by a fall, which left him&#xD;
senseless, and he how les in a fever in a neighboring house, so&#xD;
ill that no arrest has yet been made. The cadet wounded, a&#xD;
Mr. Demostheries Jones, is not dangerously though severely&#xD;
wounded. The name of the culprt is-&#xD;
Ere the readereould proceed furthei0lement rushed madly&#xD;
from the cabin, although had he remained he would have heard&#xD;
that the sentence concluded, "not known to us, as the officers&#xD;
of the institution have requested that it- should not be made&#xD;
public,many having doubts as to the guilt of the party suspected."&#xD;
But Clement, feeling the brand of Cain upon his brow, rusheL&#xD;
out upon the.deck, where -the mad howling of the storm was in&#xD;
unison with his own troubled heart. Soon the tempest seemed&#xD;
to lull, as if it had exhausted its force, but after a brief 'lul, it&#xD;
swept along with such fury as to rend what canvas was set into&#xD;
shreds, while everything on deck was buried beneath a torrent,&#xD;
and then carried into a trough of' a trgpnendous sea. Round-&#xD;
houses, chicken-coops and water-casks were carried from their&#xD;
fastenings as if they had been paper, and Clmn  pencer found&#xD;
himself struggling for life in the floating mass-of' ruins; while&#xD;
the vessel was forging fast ahead. Grasping a hen-coop, with&#xD;
the thought that it was the only chance for life, he was tossed&#xD;
about all night, and the morning found him alone on the wide&#xD;

Yet Providence had another fate in store for him, and he was&#xD;
picked up by a French vessel 'returning from Cayenne, the offi-&#xD;
cers and crew of which vied with each other in their kindness'&#xD;
to the waif which they had found floating on the wide ocean&#xD;
exhausted and insensible. They asked his name when he was&#xD;
sufficiently restored to speak, but the exposure which he imag-&#xD;

-CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
A CLOUDED HEARTHSTONE*&#xD;
&#xD;
IDA PATTERSON, although she heard-stories to the prejudice..&#xD;
of Clement :Spencer on every hand, believed them not. He&#xD;
might be beggared, of disreputable origin, quarrelsome, ay, an&#xD;
assassin, in the opinion of others, but her heart told her that&#xD;
these tales were originated in the malicious imagination of&#xD;
others. The tones of his voice ever echoed in her heart, like&#xD;
the summer-wind playing over harp strings, and. every echo but&#xD;
asserted his integrity and his innocence. Sometimes, when he&#xD;
was lying ill at West Point, she would determine to see him,&#xD;
let the hazard be what it might. Strange plans for visiting him&#xD;
would float through her. mind-plans which had, no basis save&#xD;
in fancy. Then she would picture in imagination the day when&#xD;
all these clouds would vanish, and their love-linked hearts could&#xD;
enjoy the pure happiness of'undisturbed intercourse. Hope&#xD;
had not yet been deferred long enough to make her heart sick.&#xD;
Her father treated her somewhat distantly, never omitting to,&#xD;
retail for her benefit anything to the prej udice of her lover; and'&#xD;
young John Spencer kept him well supplied with evil reports,&#xD;
Of course he did not add bow his tool Professor Pike worked&#xD;
to effect the ruin of'therl4ictim, or the money which that ruin&#xD;
cost. But carefully as was every circumstance paraded forth,&#xD;
by Mr. Patterson calculated to estrange her froi*r Cletnent, it&#xD;
was of no avail. The spell of his love rested on her like a magic&#xD;
charm, enchaimgig her very soul.&#xD;
One evening the broker came in at tea hour evidently in&#xD;
exeeent spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jon&#xD;

&#xD;
"Well, Ida," said he, with a sneering laugh, "have you heard&#xD;
from that Spencer vagabond 2"&#xD;
"Young Mr. John Spencer, do you mean, sir ?"&#xD;
"Young thunderbolt! You know well enough who I mean,&#xD;
you minx. That cadet, of course."&#xD;
" Well, sir."&#xD;
"Well, miss; for your sake I am glad to hear that after sham-&#xD;
ining illness so' as to prevent arrest, he managed to get down&#xD;
here, aud was off yesterday in an Indianan, bound for Calcutta.&#xD;
Joy go with him!"&#xD;
Ida sat motionless, her fine eyes distended, as she struggled&#xD;
with her feelings, and combated the dreadful fears that hovered&#xD;
around her heart.&#xD;
"Now, Ida," continued Mr. Patterson, "let ie request you to&#xD;
look favorably upon young Spencer. He is good-looking, rich,&#xD;
and in every way calculated to make you a g6od husband."&#xD;
The true-hearted girl's cheek blanched with a death-like pallor&#xD;
as her father spoke; then, passionate emotion crimsoning her&#xD;
face,,she replied:&#xD;
"I regret, sir, that in this case I do not approve of your&#xD;
judgment. But I can never, never wed John Spencer; nay, his&#xD;
very presence.is odious to me."&#xD;
"What'! Do you dare speak so to me? Is this your return&#xD;
for the kindness with which I have ever treated you ?"exclaimed&#xD;
the angry father, rising, and walking to and fro in the room.&#xD;
" Sir," replied Ida, in a firm tone, " you would not surely have&#xD;
me act hypocritically, or deceive you as to jny own feelings.&#xD;
But my mind is firmly made up upon this question, and it is&#xD;
useless to discuss it."&#xD;
"Nay, but hear me. My life, Ida, has been that of every one&#xD;
in mercantile life-full of vicissitudes. My profits have been&#xD;
good, and although my losses have been great, yet I have ever&#xD;
continued to increase my capital; not for myself, bqt for you-&#xD;
for you, my-only pride. Every wish of your heart has been&#xD;
gratified, every desire of your fancy' has been supplied; yet now,&#xD;
when for the first time I ask a favor of you, I am repulsed with&#xD;
scorn.&#xD;
" Not scorn, sir; but surely if you love me- you eannotiexpect&#xD;
me to marry a man for whom I have no feeling but contempt.''&#xD;
"Nay," was the reply, and'the haughty merchant's soul quaiiled&#xD;
before his daughter's glance. "You mnay change your opinion&#xD;

"Gently, Ida. That word, if irrevocable, Is the knell of my&#xD;
hopes."&#xD;
"Of your hopes.,&#xD;
Ay. Listen. About five years since, I was-induced to enter&#xD;
into stock speculations, in the hope of increasing my wealth--&#xD;
your wealth. For a time I was fortunate, but then the tideof&#xD;
fortune changed. "Now," and as he spoke, he lowered his&#xD;
voice almost to a whisper, "I am beggared."&#xD;
"My poor, dear father " exclaimed Ida, kneeling at his feet,&#xD;
~and gazing earnestly in his face; "and it has been for me that&#xD;
you have toiled and worked? Let me now comfort you in your&#xD;
affliction."&#xD;
"Will you not extricate me from it ?"&#xD;
" That I will," exclaimed the noble-hearted girl. "I will toil&#xD;
for you; I will give lessons-.-ay, beg for you.".&#xD;
"Alas, Ida, all that you could make would be but as a drop in&#xD;
the bucket. Yet you have it in your power to retrieve my po-&#xD;
sition. The world knows not of my embarrassments, and you&#xD;
can save me."&#xD;
"How ?" inquired the young girl.&#xD;
"My only creditor, Ida, is John Spencer." .&#xD;
,"And he asks me for bis son as a receipt for the debtAI" coolly&#xD;
regar4  Ida, in sad tones, her lip curling with scorn, and a&#xD;
glance o eager Inquiry on her face.&#xD;
"11 He does, and demands his answer tonight. Would that&#xD;
the evil hour could ba put off?"&#xD;
For some moments there was a dead silence, The book of.&#xD;
fate was open before them, and on its pages one read a heart-&#xD;
misery worse than death, while th other saw stamped the&#xD;
downfall of his commercial prosperity. The worst was before&#xD;
them, and powerful was their soul-egit4 At that trying hour.&#xD;
At last Ida spoke.&#xD;
"Father," said she,.&#xD;
" My child,"&#xD;
" I can no longer hesitae It would be an iil return for your&#xD;
kindness, did I throw my happiness into the scale against your&#xD;
own, #fy heart I can never give to John Spencer, but if my&#xD;
fand wflr relieve you, my dear father, pledge it as you will." '&#xD;
" Heaven bless you, generous girl!I" said the cold-hearted&#xD;
man of business.. " The house of Patterson will remain stead-&#xD;
&#xD;
Vast, and I hope that happiness will reward your sacrifice. I&#xD;
must hasten to tell Spencer the good news.".&#xD;
Imprinting a cold kiss upon his daughter's colder brow, he&#xD;
left the room, while she slowly sought her own apartment, lock-&#xD;
ing the door behind her. Then extinguishing the lights, she&#xD;
buried her face in the sofa cushion, as if she woulh shut out&#xD;
every sight and sound that could recall the interview just con-&#xD;
cluded, and concentrate the energies of her soul upon the re-&#xD;
volting prospect before her. At first she felt the shoek to the&#xD;
full extent of human agony, and apprehension left no room for&#xD;
hope. Then the loved image of-Clement flitted like sunshine&#xD;
across her' troubled heart, and she felt that there might be a&#xD;
chance to'escape, after all.&#xD;
She was aroused from her meditations by a noise in the street&#xD;
below, with a loud peal at the door-bell. A moment more, and&#xD;
there was a tramping of feet in the hall below, and rushing out,&#xD;
she gazed over the banisters. One look sufficed. Her father&#xD;
had been brought home, covered with blood. She almost flew&#xD;
down stairs, but no kindly glance met hers. The eyes were&#xD;
closed in death; the hand she grasped was cold. He had ,been&#xD;
knocked down by a pair of runaway horses; the carriage they&#xD;
wereIharnessed to had passed over him. He was dead!&#xD;
Bitter was the grief of Ida, who now felt alone in the world,&#xD;
and fondly did .she gather from the past each kind action of&#xD;
her departed parent, to outweigh all remembrance of the sacri-&#xD;
fice he had asked at their last interview. Thankful was she;&#xD;
too, that she had expressed a willingness to make this sacrifice&#xD;
for his sake.&#xD;
The funeral was over, and the next day Mr. Patterson's lawyer&#xD;
sent an urgent summons to Ida, requesting her immediate pres-&#xD;
ence in the drawing-room. A kind-hearted, genial old gentle-&#xD;
man was he, and often had the now weeping girL cheered him&#xD;
with her merry laughter when on business visits at the house.&#xD;
"Miss Ida," said he, "I regret having to disturb your grief,&#xD;
but I have no alternative. You may not be aware that Mr.&#xD;
Patterson's affairs have been of late sadly deranged by stock&#xD;
speculations, and he has consequently died insolvent."&#xD;
Alas! to Ida it was enough to think that he was dead. -She&#xD;
said nothing, but wept bitterly..&#xD;
" To secure his principal, in fact his~ only creditor, Mr. Johrn&#xD;
Spencer, he: had mortgaged this house, its furniture, and every-&#xD;
thing else he possessed. Now I am charged with the unpi&#xD;

ant duty of' asking you if you wish to remain aa-the betrothed&#xD;
bride of Mr. Spencer's son, or whether--"&#xD;
The good man's voice faltered, and he hesitated. But Ida&#xD;
continued: "Or whether I will go -forth into the world a&#xD;
beggar?"&#xD;
" Not a beggar, my dear young lady. My house is ever open&#xD;
to you. But Mr. Spencer demands an answer, and I fear wjll&#xD;
seek to enforce his rights."&#xD;
Ere Ida could reply,' the door was opened, and the two&#xD;
Spencers entered-father and son.&#xD;
";Well, my retty one," chuckled the old man, "you've con-&#xD;
cluded-to marry Johnny, I s'pose, and call me father?"&#xD;
" Making me the happiest fellow in York," continued the son,&#xD;
attempting. to clasp Ida around the waist.&#xD;
"Back, sir !" she exclaimed, her eyes flashing fire. "You&#xD;
may have a right to this house and furniture, but not to me."&#xD;
"Highty tighty!" said the elder Spencer. "What does this&#xD;
mean ?"&#xD;
"You can see, sir," replied the lawyer. "Miss Patterson is&#xD;
evidently not disposed to comply with your son's proposal."'&#xD;
"Leave this house, then, you hussy!" roared the infuriated&#xD;
old man. "My John is not to be spurned for nothing, and by&#xD;
)a beggar. Leave the house !"&#xD;
"Miss Patterson has a legal right to remain here long enough.&#xD;
to remove her personal effects," firmly replied the lawyer.&#xD;
"And my house is open to her."       .&#xD;
" Thanks-thanks !" exclaimed Ida. "Let me- leave these&#xD;
detestable people immediately."&#xD;
"But, miss," the younger Spencer began.&#xD;
"Not a word, sir!" interrupted Ida. "I might have married&#xD;
you to have gratified my poor father, but not to save my own.&#xD;
life, now that lie is gone."&#xD;
Taking the lawyer's arn, she left- the room with him, and&#xD;
before night, was comfortably installed in his comfortable little&#xD;
dwelling, having only taken her wardrobe and a few cherished&#xD;
souvenirs. A few days afterwards, the following advertisement&#xD;
appeared in the " Evening Star :"&#xD;
" WANTED.-A place as governess, by 'a young lady who is&#xD;

&#xD;
YEARS passed, and Clement Spencer, or, as he now- called.&#xD;
himself, Clement Clayton, was battling for existence on the..&#xD;
waves of Parisian humanity, where the struggler must make for&#xD;
some secure haven, or sink to perish. .It was well, perhaps.&#xD;
that-he was thus forced to toil for subsistence, as the exigencies.&#xD;
of his situation diverted his thoughts from the trials through&#xD;
which he had passed; yet his lot was a hard one.&#xD;
He had adopted literature as a pursuit, and at first was fortu-&#xD;
nate enough to obtain a position as private secretary to an Eng-&#xD;
lish gentleman, who was making historical researches concerning&#xD;
the reign of Napoleon. He was a kind-hearted though severe&#xD;
employer, and. steadily was Clement forced to toil on through&#xD;
masses of manuscript, copying what was pertinent to the subject,&#xD;
and actually shaping it for a place in the work .in progress.&#xD;
But the young man brought the treasures of his lofty intellect&#xD;
to aid him in the task, and gradually his countenance began to&#xD;
resume its former serenity. At last he was sent by his employer&#xD;
to different archives in France, and it was on returning from&#xD;
one of these fact-harvesting excursions that he found himself&#xD;
without a master. Death had arrested the author; the book&#xD;
was suspended, and the man-of-all-work was again destitute.&#xD;
Sad were the privations which he endured for months, but&#xD;
just as famine was about to clutch him with her skeleton hand,&#xD;
he obtained a situation as proof-reader in'an English printing-&#xD;
office. Among other pirated works published was "Irving's&#xD;
Sketch Book,'' and it was while poring over the proofs that he&#xD;
became fired with literary ambition. All day he would, toil at&#xD;
his desk, and then at night seek to convey to paper his own&#xD;
ideas. He would write a book on Paris itself-a book .which&#xD;
would reflect "La Grande Ville " as in a mirror, with pleasing&#xD;
fidelity, and yet be worthy an honorable place. upon the shelves&#xD;
of a library. The task was not an easy.one,.yet he worked at&#xD;
it resolutely. Often, after the humiliations and toils of his&#xD;

&#xD;
regular employment, where he was exposed to the angry taunts&#xD;
of every compositor in.whose "proof" he marked many errors,&#xD;
would he pen such sentences as only can portray Parisian life.&#xD;
To him the metropolis of Charlemagne, and of Champagne, noble&#xD;
and sparkling, was a pedestal upon which he could not fail to&#xD;
erect a proud monument.1&#xD;
At last the work was'completed, and sent to a London pub-&#xD;
lisher. Was it to be accepted?. For days and for weeks he&#xD;
waited a reply, and at length it came. The manuscript was&#xD;
returned, and the next day there came to the printing-office&#xD;
advance sheets of a precisely similar work, by a noted English&#xD;
author. His darling idea had been pirated--nay, his employer_&#xD;
had been requested to find him ~out, and silence him as to the'.&#xD;
theft. lie did so, by discharging him. How dared a proof-&#xD;
reader of his to attempt a book!&#xD;
Out of employment again, he grew thinner and paler, feeling,&#xD;
moreover, a cynical contempt for literary fame. COccasionally&#xD;
he obtained some copying; then some French printing-office&#xD;
needed an English proof-reader, or some Parisian shop-keeper -&#xD;
paid Jhim for a course of lessons in the language of the best&#xD;
customers. But when lodgings, and fuel, and food, and clothes&#xD;
were paid for, little remained of these precarious earnings.&#xD;
Turning over the newspapers one morning, he saw an adver-&#xD;
tisement, for "-a secretary who understood drawing and the&#xD;
English language." Hastening to the address given, he found&#xD;
that it was froman American, who'wished to introduce several&#xD;
new patents into France, and he easily obtained the situation.&#xD;
A great man was General Fulcrum, his new employer-thaf&#xD;
is, the general thought so himself. He had unquestionably&#xD;
somie- valuable inventions, although it was not so clear that he&#xD;
had first discovered them, but his cash capital was very scanty,&#xD;
as Clement found to his sorrow. What was more annoying&#xD;
than anything else, was the-coolness with which he put his owna&#xD;
name on Clement's carefully executed drawings, though he.&#xD;
obtained the young man's autograph on the back of certain&#xD;
promissory notes, "just to cai'ry on operations."  '-&#xD;
France was then in a troubled state, as Louis Philippe was '&#xD;
busy in getting up the revolution which gave him his throne,&#xD;
and the general found. few willing to invest in his invent ions.&#xD;
At last his exchequer became exhausted, and when Clement went'&#xD;
to work one morning, with a full determination to have his&#xD;
arrearages paid or seek other employment, he found himself&#xD;
&#xD;
-arrested for debt. . General Fulcrum - had left for Russia, with&#xD;
his drawings and models; so the rapacious creditors pounced&#xD;
upon Clement, who had'heedlessly'endorsed his employer's bills&#xD;
of exchange, and was, thus liable to a large amount.&#xD;
"Take nothing from nothing, and nothing remains," was his&#xD;
reply to the vociferous. demands made upon him. But the&#xD;
creditors had been confidently informed by the general that his&#xD;
endorsing secretary was eccentric enough to'like work, yet was&#xD;
very rich. So Clement was sent to the Hotel de Clichy.&#xD;
It was a new scene in his drama of life, that Parisian debtor's&#xD;
goal, and he now saw that-his cherished look had not been per-&#xD;
feet. The small space enclosed by those high walls was itself a&#xD;
.world. 'Nobles and gamblers, jurists and proffigates,.veteran&#xD;
officers and beardless exquisites were there, each a victim to&#xD;
some unsuccessful turn of fortune's wheel. It was, in factta&#xD;
caravansary, or large boarding-house, the inmates - of which&#xD;
.were on sociable terms with each other, and were disposed to&#xD;
enjoy the maintenance which their creditors were forced to pro-&#xD;
ride for them while in "durance vile."&#xD;
Ere Clement had been long in prison, he noticed that there&#xD;
was an unusually large number of veteran officers among his&#xD;
companions. Every one of them had served under Napoleon,&#xD;
and now, grown old and wasted in glory, they were apparently&#xD;
" poor debtors," while the favorites of the Bourbons rolled in&#xD;
riches. Dearly did they, love to recount the glories of the&#xD;
"Empire," when they had aided in bearing in triumph the tri-&#xD;
colored flag from one extremity of Europe to' the other, until it&#xD;
sank at Waterloo. Nor was it long before Clement, unacquainted&#xD;
as he was with French- politics, saw that some great 'crisis was&#xD;
at hand.&#xD;
Beranger, a poet-prisoner, was in fact the apostle of this new&#xD;
revolution, and Clement happening to win his favor, soon had&#xD;
the pleasure of copying his verses, which were distributed in&#xD;
manuscript as -the best seeds of revolt. The, poet knew the&#xD;
-character of his countrymen, and spoke alike to their senses,-to&#xD;
'Their passions, and to their appetites. Combining the talents of&#xD;
Anacreon 'and Tyrtarus, he wore a double crown of thorny lau-.&#xD;
rels and of thornless roses. All ages ftnd something to admire&#xD;
in his varied stanzas-the young girl and the, old soldier, the&#xD;
peasant and the i-evolutionist. Alf drank from the cup of love&#xD;
'and of liberty which his songs'presented,-and all who read: or&#xD;

&#xD;
sang those songs-felt fixed upon their hearts a profound contempt&#xD;
for -the Bourbon occupant of the throne.&#xD;
. While copying these revolutionary lyrics in Beranger's room,&#xD;
Clement became acquainted with most of the officers in prison,&#xD;
among them General de Guyon, one of the bravest of Napoleon's&#xD;
braves. It wassaid that the general was one of the old nobility,&#xD;
who fell under the ban of Robespierre' and came near losing his&#xD;
head on the guillotine. At any rate, he lost his. property, his&#xD;
estate. and his wife--the latter having madeher escape with&#xD;
most of his available property to America. He never sought&#xD;
her-never expressed a desire to enjoy either her society or his&#xD;
own wealth again; but he entered - Napoleon's army as a- cap-&#xD;
tain, and with a cynical contempt for life, had so distinguished&#xD;
himself as to command a brigade when the star of his master&#xD;
paled at Waterloo.&#xD;
One morning, Beranger came to Clement's room-for there&#xD;
was no restraint within the prison walls-and gave him a song,&#xD;
which he had just written, with a request that he would make&#xD;
as many copies as possible -before night. It was that verse-&#xD;
concealed Invitation to Louis Philippe, commencing:  '&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ah! if by chance some cavalier,&#xD;
Loving and loyal, should appear,&#xD;
And triumph o'er the jailor. here&#xD;
Who guards me in this turret drear-&#xD;
How I should bless that cavalier."&#xD;
&#xD;
As the poet not-only softened the rigor of Clement's prisonlife&#xD;
by his kindness, but insisted on remunerating him for his labors,&#xD;
the young man set to work. All that. day did he write, and&#xD;
the shades of night were drawn around the prison, when his&#xD;
pen-weary fingers refusedto toil longer. Taking his copies, he&#xD;
went to Beranger's room, but it was vacant. The night was a&#xD;
pleasant one, so -he stepped out on a small, balcony before the&#xD;
window, which, commanded a view of the city. A-large chair&#xD;
invited him to sit down, and yielding to the influence of the&#xD;
hour, he unconsciously dropped asleep. When he awoke, he&#xD;
heard voices in'the room, and without intending to do so, he&#xD;
became a listener.&#xD;
"My friends," said a voice which he recognized as that of&#xD;
General de Guyon,. "I am glad that this farce is nearly over. It&#xD;
is amusing,.I grag, to thus deceive the Bourbon minions, and&#xD;
to be able to mature our plans in the very heart of Paris with-&#xD;

.out suspicion. Yet for one I find the prison air difficult to&#xD;
breathe. I meet you and we laugh at our police'foes, who little&#xD;
think that the debts for which we are confined were contracted&#xD;
expressly to get within these walls. But when night comes-&#xD;
when all is quiet, other prison scenes recall themselves. I think&#xD;
of my wife,, whose existence is a mystery since I was dragged&#xD;
to the tribunal-of the ill-fated, queen, Marie Antoinette-and&#xD;
of those days when every morning a hecatomb of fellow-prisoners&#xD;
were dragged to the guillotine, there to pay the penalty of rev-&#xD;
olutionary excess. 0, my friends, let us hasten this business !"&#xD;
"And I," exclaimed Beranger, "I, who love sparkling wine&#xD;
and gay society, find. it hard 'to - beat my wings against cage&#xD;
bars."&#xD;
"Yet the nightingale sings sweetest when confined," answered.&#xD;
another.&#xD;
"A truce to pleasantry," said a deep voice. "I learn that the&#xD;
press is to be muzzled to-morrow; if so, the hour is at hand. At&#xD;
any rate I have drawn up a final plan of action, and will read it."&#xD;
The truth had flashed upon Clement. The leaders of a pro-&#xD;
jected revolution, watched by the police, had procured their&#xD;
own arrests for debt, and thus were enabled to plot in security.&#xD;
But it would not be honorable for ,him to remain a listener,,.&#xD;
Announcing himself by a cough, he rose, and entered the room.&#xD;
"Betrayed I" was the exclamation of half a dozen, while all&#xD;
sprang to their feet, as if moved by an electric shock.&#xD;
"Monsieur Beranger," said Clement, "I came here to bring&#xD;
you these songs. You were not here, and going. out to enjoy&#xD;
the evening air, I fell asleep. Your voices awoke me, nor. have&#xD;
I lost time in ceasing to play the part of a listener."&#xD;
"Are you an Englishman?" asked the individual who was&#xD;

A POLITICIAN'S HOME.&#xD;
WLI;E Clement was thus whirled about in the maelstrom of&#xD;
Parisian life, Ida Patterson enjoyed the tranquil calm of planta-&#xD;
tion life on the dark blue water-edge of the Gulf of Mexico. It&#xD;
was one of those sea-islands separated from the main land by the&#xD;
low swamps of the "delta," 'covered by impervious thickets of&#xD;
cane and sedge, which rendered all access impossible. But&#xD;
approach it by- a boat, and it seemed like fairy-land--.the very&#xD;
place to have attracted the gay Frenchman who first occupied it&#xD;
and founded a feudal home. The mansion was a quaint,irregu-&#xD;
lar structure, or rather collection of structures, surrounded by'&#xD;
broad connecting verandahs, which were enclosed with green&#xD;
blinds. Woodbines and honeysuckles clustered over the building,&#xD;
extending to the very chimney-tops with their graceful tendrils.&#xD;
And in front of the wide hall door, sloping towards the gently&#xD;
swelling waves of'the gulf, was a green lawn,'dotted with groups&#xD;
of shrubbery.&#xD;
It was the ancestral home of the Ledroits, and the head of&#xD;
the establishment, at the time whereof we write, was the widow&#xD;
of a brave officer who fought and fell at New-Orleans. A stately&#xD;
and very beautiful woman was Madame Ledroit, managing the&#xD;
colony around her with a spirit andlnethod which showed that&#xD;
she not only thought, but had a right to think well of herself.&#xD;
On no plantation were the negroes happier or more industrious,&#xD;
the crops larger or more marketable, or the supplies distributed&#xD;
with less waste, and the Ledroit brand oii a hogshead of sugar&#xD;
made it always worth an additional 'half cent a pound at New&#xD;
Orleans, at any day.&#xD;
Neither was it strange that the son of such -a mother, the heir&#xD;
to such an estate, had. been chosen at the earliest possible age&#xD;
to represent his native State in the senate of the republic. It&#xD;
was but an additional reason to the true-hearted matron why&#xD;
6he should continue to manage the plantation, though another's&#xD;
comfort was also.to be taken into consideration. The seclusion&#xD;

ifk especlaly grateful to her other child-her deforni&amp;amp; yet&#xD;
darling daughter Isabel.&#xD;
It was as a companion and govrness to this unfortunate young&#xD;
girl that Ida Patterson had become an inmate of the house which&#xD;
we have just, described. At first the task was a difficult one,&#xD;
for her petted charge stubbornly refused to study; but Ida per-&#xD;
severed with stoic resolution, and conquered by gentleness alone.&#xD;
In return, the afficted .girl's confidence repaid Ida, and Madame&#xD;
Ledroit's kindness soothed her lacerated heart. Yet'she was&#xD;
no longer the gay, light-hearted beauty. The patient, self-sac-&#xD;
rificing governess waÂ§ another person from the frivolous heiress,&#xD;
ard the very expression of her face was changed. The flush&#xD;
had left her cheek, and the dancing smile het lip, yet there was&#xD;
a thoughtful beauty on her attenuated countenance which more&#xD;
than compensated for their loss,&#xD;
She had heard that Clement Spencer had. been swept into the&#xD;
raging ocean, and she knew that his friend Clement mourned&#xD;
for him as one dead; yet, somehow, she never could entertain&#xD;
the thought. In spite of all her darkened hopes, and of all her&#xD;
hopeless fears, the dear dream would sometimes come-sleeping&#xD;
and waking-that Clvnent was alive; ay, that he loved her, and&#xD;
that the sunlight of her first love would yet be the mid-day&#xD;
brightness of her life.&#xD;
It was not to be wondered at that Ida Patterson not only won&#xD;
the affections of her pupil, but of thematronly head of the es-&#xD;
tablishment. She found in the young governess her beau-ideal.&#xD;
of a woman, and as years confirmed her good opinion,she began&#xD;
to think that she could love the friendless orphan as a 'daughter.&#xD;
Indeed, it was a matterof great uneasiness to her that her son&#xD;
had never, anid the excitements of political life, thought of mat-&#xD;
rimony. Who so fit to "love and cherish" him, in his proud&#xD;
career, as- the gentle, patient Ida-the very life, too, of the un-P&#xD;
fortunate Isabel? At length, so strong were her convictions&#xD;
that it would be for the happiness of all concerned, she deter-&#xD;
mined to mention it to her son when he next came home.&#xD;
Alas ! when he next came, it was to find his mother on the&#xD;
brink of the grave. A sudden yet dangerous illness had pros-&#xD;
trated her, and when her anxiously expected son arrived, the&#xD;
lamp of her life seemed flickering in its socket. Yet, like the&#xD;
last glimmer of an expiring taper, she appeared to recover health&#xD;
and strength as she grasped the hand of her darling boy. What&#xD;
happiness to gaze once more on his dear face!&#xD;

THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Leave us," said the Invalid, in a faint voice. "I would speak&#xD;
to my son."&#xD;
The anxious group went out, but in a few moments they were&#xD;
recalled by a fearful cry from the very heart of the sorrowing&#xD;
son. Hastening back, they found him prostrate on the floor,&#xD;
while on the bed lay the lifeless rem.dns of his another. The&#xD;
angel of death had flung the dark shadow of his wing over her,&#xD;
as she was communicating the last earthly wish of her soul to&#xD;
her son. There was no trace of suffering upon her fade, and&#xD;
she lay in "the rapture of repose."&#xD;
Isabel, sustained by the composing counsels of Ida Patterson,&#xD;
bowed meekly beneath the stroke; but the bereaved son, with&#xD;
all his philosophy, writhed under it in insupportable agony.&#xD;
Remaining in the solitude of his own room (except at meal&#xD;
times), for weeks no smile crossed his countenance, and he would&#xD;
sit at his window forhours, gazing vacantly upon the broad ex-&#xD;
panse of waters, but not-regarding the objects on it, for a wild,&#xD;
gulf of thought was surging within his own troubled heart.&#xD;
Yet when his sister Isabel at last enticed him into the quiet&#xD;
itting-room where she passed her time with her governess, and&#xD;
he saw the estimable qualities of Ida Patterson, a change seemed&#xD;
to come over the spirit of his day-dreams.' Soon he found him..&#xD;
self never content unless near her, listening to catch her slight-&#xD;
est word, though schooling his tongue to cold courtesy, while&#xD;
his heart was all a-glow. At last the decisive moment arrived.&#xD;
"Brother,"saido Isabel Ledroit, one morning, "1 have had a&#xD;
letter from old Mrs. Wortley this morning, and what do you&#xD;
suppose she proposes ?"&#xD;
"Indeed I can't say," was the answer.&#xD;
"Why, she says that as, of course, Miss ,Patterson cannot&#xD;
remain at a bachelor's establishment, she would like to engage&#xD;
her' as governess to those frightful little nieces of hers. What&#xD;
coolness!"&#xD;
This remark, innocently as it was made, went to Ida Patterson's&#xD;
very heart. She had never dreamed that there was any impro-&#xD;
priety in her remaining at the plantation, and yet it fiashe dupon&#xD;
her mind that the world would censure her. Was she to go&#xD;
forth again, like the dove from the ark, to seek a haven of rest ?&#xD;
Mr. Ledreit was also struck by the evident worldly impropri-&#xD;
ety of Ida's reniaining there, and what added to'his trouble was&#xD;
her eviden embarrassment. Could it be, he thought (with that&#xD;
vanity which men do possess), that she loved him ? Hlad he'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;
79&#xD;
&#xD;
gained her affections? And what was his duty? In vain did Ida&#xD;
make an attempt at forced cheerfulness, though she little thought&#xD;
what agony was. sweeping like a whirlwind through the heart&#xD;
whose workings were concealed by the cold, proud brow before&#xD;
her.&#xD;
When breakfast was over, Mr. Ledroit went into the library,&#xD;
where he-sat down in heartfelt misery. The threads of fate&#xD;
seemed tangled in inextricable confusion around him, and it&#xD;
was in vain that he sought to penetrate into the mysterious&#xD;
future. The door opened, and Ida Patterson entered.&#xD;
"Excuse me," said she; "I came for a book."&#xD;
"Nay," exclaimed Mr. Ledroit; "Providence has sent you&#xD;
hither. Sit down, Miss Patterson, and bear me."&#xD;
Ida obeyed mechanically.&#xD;
" Miss Patterson," said Mr. Ledroit, as he toolc a chair and&#xD;
sat directly before her, "I have sought this interview since my&#xD;
poor mother's death, yet have not found the moral courage to&#xD;
ask it of you. It was her wish-her last wish-that I should&#xD;
offer you my hand. But alas! my dear Miss Patterson, the fatal&#xD;
obstacle must now be told. I-I have already plighted my faith&#xD;
at God's holy altar."&#xD;
" Thank heaven!"' exclaimed Ida. "My heart is also an-&#xD;
other's, but now I can love you as a father."&#xD;
"As a father !" said Mr. Ledroit, with surprise.&#xD;
Never had he dreamed but the dependentt governess, who&#xD;
was without home or friends, had loved another, or could not&#xD;
love him. Never had he dreamed that she would have been too&#xD;
glad to reciprocate his love.. And now she merely aid.that she&#xD;
could feel a childlike affection for him.&#xD;
" Miss Patterson," said he, "perhaps you misunderstood. -me.&#xD;
I was married, though my poor mother knew it not. But she&#xD;
to whom I plighted my early love has long slumbered in the&#xD;
tomb. Can I not love again?"&#xD;
"I know not," replied Ida, lifting her eyes with such a sweet,&#xD;
sad smile that he yielded to the enchantment. "But I never,&#xD;
never can."&#xD;
" Do I know the object of' your love ?"&#xD;
" No; indeed I fear that he is in another and a bett&amp;amp; world."&#xD;
'The mystery was solved; the gentle governess loved another,&#xD;
.and could not be his. Then came the thou ght, w as, it not better&#xD;
that it should be so ? Would it not be an offence against his first&#xD;

pure love to offer. another the heart which was once her&#xD;
Sown ?&#xD;
"Mr. Ledroit," W  'id Ida, her eyes filling with tears, "I came&#xD;
here a friendless orphan, and found comfort in the love of your&#xD;
mother and your sister. Can I not so remain-the friend of&#xD;
poor Isabel as of yourself, ready to show her, by endeavoring&#xD;
to supply her mother's place, how grateful I am for the privi-&#xD;
lege of so doing? And -you,sir-you"who introduced:me, here,&#xD;
you, who have ever treated me so kiri'dly-mO, let me be to you&#xD;
as a daughter, loving you-yes, loving you with a love pure as&#xD;
that of the angels with whom your sainted mother now looks&#xD;
down upon us "&#xD;
Flinging himself on his knees' at her feet, the proud politician&#xD;
asked her forgiveness. He told her of his early love, of its&#xD;
trials, of its sad termination by the death- of his wife before he&#xD;
could even present her to his mother. A child, too, had been&#xD;
for years his secret comfort, when it was mercilessly snatched&#xD;
away by death. Thenceforth his heart was sealed, until he&#xD;
saw her, when he began to feel again the influence of love. In'&#xD;
vaiin did he battle with the temptation, so blinding was the&#xD;
'fascination. Then came the sad scene of his mother's death-&#xD;
bed, and her will was added to his own heart-desire. He felt&#xD;
wretched; he saw -the remedy at hand. It was well, perhaps,&#xD;
that he could not succeed, for a union might have been a source&#xD;
of misery to both, and now he only asked to be permitted to&#xD;
love her as 'a brother.&#xD;
"No, no," replied Ida; "not as a brother, but as a .father.&#xD;
Such is your love for Isabel, although-she is your sister, for you&#xD;
are much her senior in years.I Let us be sisters, and' you can&#xD;
find in us kind daughters, who will seek to scatter flowers of&#xD;
pleasantness over your pathway through life."&#xD;
"As- you please," he' answered, rising "to his feet, and feeling&#xD;
a great weight removed from his heart. "Perhaps it is for the&#xD;
.best."&#xD;
"I am sure it Is," wa Ida's decided reply; and the entrance&#xD;
of 'Ida put a stop' to further conversation.&#xD;
A few weeks afterwards, he left again for Wasington ,and&#xD;
in due time a kind old gentleman and his wife-distant con-&#xD;
nexions 'of Isabel's-were installed at the plantation.&#xD;
Orne day, after the arrival. of the mail, Ida was carelessly&#xD;
looking over a New York paper, when her eye was arrested by&#xD;
the following paragraph : '&#xD;

. REVOLUTION AND A RECRUIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
"AnI! arm!" The cry echoed from one extriemity of Paris&#xD;
to the other, and that evening every prisoner in the debtor's gaol&#xD;
found himself at liberty. It was a clear, starry night; and as&#xD;
Clement accompanied'his friends to their headquarters, he found&#xD;
every street alive with busy workers. Trees were cut down and&#xD;
paving stones were torn up to form barricades across the streets;&#xD;
and at one of these, whether completed or irrprocess of construc-&#xD;
tion, sentinels kept careful watch. Men and women, haggard fish-&#xD;
wives and sprucely-dressed students, wrought like demons at&#xD;
these extemporaneous fortifications, and occsionally the gun-&#xD;
smiths "plied their rattling trade " by the light of blazing torch-&#xD;
es, as they repaired the weapons for the morrow's fight. 'The&#xD;
appearance of Lafayette and De Guyon, with a staff of veterans,&#xD;
was hailed with cheers. The people welcomed their old leaders,&#xD;
and swore that they would, follow them until France was free.&#xD;
When day dawned, the city was so fortified and defended that&#xD;
i could not have been taken by a million of armed mea. What&#xD;
few royal troops there were hesitated and faltered; but the popu-&#xD;

uFUNERAL.-There was a large attendance 'of our first&#xD;
citizens yesterday, at the funeral of the late John Spencer, Esq.&#xD;
His untiring industry and persevering business ability are well&#xD;
known in the community, and he has left a large estate to his&#xD;
son and partner. We learn, by the way, that the younger Mr.&#xD;
Spencer was last week to have been married to the wealthy&#xD;
Mrs. Eastburn, and suppose that this combination of the two&#xD;
largest fortunes in the fourth Ward will not long be delayed.&#xD;
Mi-s. Eastburn, it will be remembered, owns the ten -rock&#xD;
estates at Bloomingdale, and the coal mines of. Mr. Spencer&#xD;
alone are estimated worth a million of dollars."&#xD;
Not long after this, Mr. Ledroit came to the plantation to&#xD;
make a brief visit, yet did not even remain. as long as he had&#xD;
originally intended.&#xD;
"1I am untangling a web of villany," said he, the night before&#xD;
he left, "after having vainly sought the, clue for years."&#xD;

lace was full of rage and determination, while even the more&#xD;
sober citizens were breathless  with agitation. Bloodshed was&#xD;
inevitable, nor was it long before the deadly conflict commenced,&#xD;
every ward resounding with the rattling fire of musketry and&#xD;
the roar of cannon.&#xD;
The plan of Genergl de Guyon was followed to the letter.&#xD;
Column after column, officered by the ardent plytechic&#xD;
studeLts,jmarched against barrack, and palace, and guard-house,&#xD;
waving the tri-color in triumph; and easily subduing the fatigued&#xD;
and half-famished troops. Or did the royalist officers attempt to&#xD;
urge their men against the barricaders, women would hurl from&#xD;
the windows paving-stones, bricks, or their household furniture,&#xD;
regardless of the balls which would often strike down the&#xD;
mother by the side of her child's cradle. Night came, and the&#xD;
people 'were triumphant, although afew of the fortified barracks&#xD;
held out. While the soldiers buried the dead, the officers held&#xD;
a. council of war.&#xD;
General de Guyon claimed the right, as the originator of the&#xD;
movements so successful, to head the attack against what was&#xD;
considered the strongest position occupied by the royalist troops.&#xD;
It was a fortified guard-house opposite the Palais Royal, and was&#xD;
occupied by several companies of the Swiss Guard, well provided&#xD;
with ammunition and having two ,pieces of cannon. The boon&#xD;
was granted; and no sooner was it known that the-old veteran&#xD;
was to head the assault, than volunteers began to arrive at the&#xD;
Place Vendome, where he established his headquarters. Many a&#xD;
cordial greeting was interchanged between old battle-comrades,&#xD;
who had fought side by side on, hard-fought fields, and who now&#xD;
.were "again in arms and eager for the fray."&#xD;
Soon after daylight, t4 general reviewed his forces, and started&#xD;
for the scene of action in admirable order. Everything about the&#xD;
guard-house was silent as the grave, until the head .of the&#xD;
column was within about a hundred yards of it, when a blaze of&#xD;
fire ran along its front, and clouds of white smoke curled upward, '&#xD;
as a tremendous discharge of musketry -and cannister-shot&#xD;
mowed down the assailants. '&#xD;
"I 'orward ! forward !" shouted General de Guyon; and onward&#xD;
pushed the masses, while from the guard-house rang out the roar&#xD;
of the field-pieces, and the ringing discharge of -the musketry,&#xD;
drowning the groans of the wounded and dying. "Forward!&#xD;
forward !" On thle revolptionists pushed, with invincible resolui&#xD;

tion, determined to conquer or die. The building was reached,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
and then, with a cheer that was the funeral requiem of the Bour,&#xD;
bon dynasty, the thick doors were burst open. Onward pressed&#xD;
the impetuous assailants, and soon the entire building was&#xD;
taken.&#xD;
That night Lafayett e was installeeI at the Hotel de Ville, and&#xD;
prominent-in the throng around him were General de Guyon&#xD;
and his young- aid-de-camp, Cleient Clayton. By carrying&#xD;
orders in the thickest of the fight, and gallantly heading the&#xD;
storming .party, the young American had won much applause.&#xD;
"A trained soldier," they said,"' could not have manceuvered his&#xD;
command with more decision."&#xD;
All at once conversation was hushed. It was evident that&#xD;
something had occurred, and soon the well-known voice ot&#xD;
General de Guyon was heard.&#xD;
"Citizens," said he, "we have among us Louis Philippe, duke&#xD;
of Orleans, to whom it is proposed to tender the crown of France,&#xD;
if he will govern in accordance with a free constitution. Can&#xD;
this be so?"&#xD;
Silence reigned. There was po enthusiasm-no cheering, and&#xD;
Lafayette had it in his power to have declared himself in favor&#xD;
of a republic. But the wily Louis Philippe had already entered&#xD;
into conversation with the honest "farmer of La Grange," and&#xD;
so worked upon his feelings by well-timed allusions to his past&#xD;
fame, that he, without consultation, led him out upon the&#xD;
balcony, 'and presented him to the assembled multitude.&#xD;
"Here," said Lafayette, "is the best of republics !'  And the&#xD;
fickle Parisians, with long-resounding shouts, hailed a new&#xD;
master who was to prove even more desp 'otic than the old one&#xD;
-who was in his turn to be driven from the throne.&#xD;
Order was at once restored, but Clement found himself again&#xD;
destitute. 'General de Guyonihad left in disgust, and was sup-&#xD;
posed'to be travelling in Germany, nor could the young man ob-&#xD;
tain any position from the new government, which he had played&#xD;
such a prodilnent part in establishing. Had he not been able to&#xD;
write graphic letters which weie taken aid adoptedd" by the&#xD;
"regular correspondent" of the London Times, he would have&#xD;
starved. In return, the correspondent graciously gave him&#xD;
ab out one quarter of the amount paid hith, finding at the same&#xD;
time a great deal of fault for that which he received great praise&#xD;
for.&#xD;
'Late one afternoon, as Clement sat endeavoring to concoct ai&#xD;
letter describing the re-organization of the army, he felt&#xD;

&#xD;
unusually dispirited. Winter was approaching, and he saw' nd&#xD;
chance of bettering his almost destitute condition. There was&#xD;
a knock at the door.&#xD;
Enter !" he exclaimed, and sprang to his feet to welcome&#xD;
his visitor. "Why, Harry Lawson, how are you?"&#xD;
It was a young English painter with whom he had been&#xD;
acquainted for some time.&#xD;
Well, Clement. But you look as sad and gloomy as though&#xD;
you had not a friend in the world."&#xD;
"Neither have I many."&#xD;
What matter? Why have the blues about it? Bear up, my&#xD;
good fellow, and quit these melancholy musings. Next thing&#xD;
your morbid imagination will take the reins of your mind, and&#xD;
drive you headlong into despair."&#xD;
"There is no imagination about my position," said Clement,&#xD;
shaking his head mournfully, and casting his eyes about the&#xD;
half-furnished, miserable room. "All is stern reality."&#xD;
Well, I admit-that you have been somewhat unlucky of late;&#xD;
so have 1. The stranger who ordered that copy of Murillo was-&#xD;
probably frightened away by the revolution, and no one has even&#xD;
asked the price of those pictures of mine at the frame-dealer's.&#xD;
Yet I don't give up."&#xD;
"Give up !" cried Clement. "Is it not best to give up when&#xD;
one is in my condition? I could laugh at difficulties like yours&#xD;
-I have laughed at them. But mine is a sadder" harder fate.&#xD;
Reared in the lap of luxury, I became a beggared outcast-how,&#xD;
I may some day tell you-and from that tine I have strugged&#xD;
and writhed under the torments of poverty. When this revolution&#xD;
broke out, and I fancied that]: was about to rise in my leg itimate&#xD;
profession, a cloud again overshadowed the sun of my hopes,.and&#xD;
I am again in the anaconda-like grasp of debt and poverty."&#xD;
"But, Clement."&#xD;
" Hear me out !" exclaimed the wretched young man. "Was&#xD;
my name pure and unstained as is my soul-was I in such a&#xD;
position that no man's poisonous breath could taint my reputa-&#xD;
tion after death, then I could court death. 'But f'or years, Harry',&#xD;
have I striven to obtain a position whence I could silence certain&#xD;
venomed tongues which poisoned my early life. They doubtless&#xD;
think me dead; but 'tis the thought of conquering their malice&#xD;
-of standing erect in m4 native land as their peer, which stays&#xD;
my hand-which prevents my ending a most miserable life." .&#xD;

let your feelings destroy your energies. You are no worse off&#xD;
than I am, and-perhaps may take the same panacea."&#xD;
"What is that ?"&#xD;
"Listen, and I will tell you. It was for that I came. But it is&#xD;
getting to be dark. Suppose we adjourn to a coffee-house ?"&#xD;
"Agreed," said Clement, with a sigh. "I wish I had your&#xD;
philosophy and buoyancy of feelings."&#xD;
The two friends went out into the gay streets, and were soon&#xD;
enjoying some excellent coffee together.&#xD;
"Now, Clement," said Lawson, "listen to me. Like you, I am&#xD;
miserably poor and not over content with my lot. This great&#xD;
metropolis, with its villany and-its dishonesty, is distasteful. I&#xD;
would fain hear the trumpets ring out their loud blasts, and&#xD;
rush into the fight, anxious for death or an honorable life."&#xD;
"Ay!" exclaimed Clement, his cheeks flushing with enthusi-&#xD;
asm, and his eye kindling at the impassioned tone of his friend.&#xD;
"Such a life would be glorious; but where can it be followed?&#xD;
How and where can the field be taken ?"&#xD;
"Enlist."&#xD;
"What ! become a machine-a puppet, to mount guard before&#xD;
a palace, or oppose popular liberty? I would rather die!"&#xD;
" Right. But there is a land,.Clemient, where the soldier 'is&#xD;
not a mere machine. It is the land of Hannibal and of Jugurtha."&#xD;
"What! Algeria ?"&#xD;
"Even so. The new dynasty has determined to perpetuate the&#xD;
conquest of Charles the Tenth, and to subjugate the warlike&#xD;
tribes of Saracens who now inhabit it. A new army is now&#xD;
being raised, and in it there is -to be a legion composed exclu-&#xD;
sively of foreigners. Why can we not enlist together, And visit&#xD;
that romantic land as comrades, we who have ever been friends ?"&#xD;
" We can," said Clement, holding out his hand, which Harry&#xD;
grasped and shook cordially.&#xD;
"And when?"&#xD;
" To-morrow, Harry, to-morrow. As the great poet says, " If&#xD;
'tis to be done, when 'tis~ done, then 'tis well 'twere done&#xD;
quickly.' Come to my room early; we will breakfast together,&#xD;
and then sign the roll."&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
THE TIDE/ TURNS.&#xD;
THE chasseurs of AfricaI Never did six hundred and ninety.-&#xD;
eight braver men cross the war-tracked Mediterranean, than&#xD;
those new comrades of Clement and Harry Lawson. They were&#xD;
the only representatives of the Anglo-Saxon race, but there was&#xD;
no lack of fair-haired Germans, stoical Swiss, daring Poles, wild-&#xD;
looking Italians, with a majority of Frenchmen.- Most of the&#xD;
foreigners were mere vagabonds, too indolent to earn an honest&#xD;
livelihood at home, and exiled for political or social crimes. To&#xD;
them the legion was a common-sewer, wherein the scum of&#xD;
society drifted; but it was different -with the French recruits.&#xD;
Most of these were young men, many thrown adrift by the&#xD;
recent revolution, who looked upon themselves as carrying the&#xD;
musket only until they could wear the epaulette. No oppor-&#xD;
tunity was suffered to pass which would qualify them for pro-&#xD;
motion without improving it; and during the pleasant passage,&#xD;
not only tactics but engineering were ordinary topics of dis-&#xD;
cussion. Why not? Promotion is open to every:Frenehman,&#xD;
and the private feels with pride that he in turn may command,&#xD;
The path of glory is open to all.&#xD;
At last the shores of Africa appeared. in sight, and the trans-&#xD;
port let go her anchor in the harbor of Algiers. All was life on&#xD;
board. The men WYN in full uniform, and grasped their muskets;&#xD;
officers were telling off their squads for disembarking, and the&#xD;
band was playing the inspiring notes of the "Marseilles Hymn."&#xD;
On landing, a varied scene presented itself as the legion filed&#xD;
through the narrow streets. There were the thick-lipped negro&#xD;
indigenous to the land-the gaunt, bright-eyed Arab, hi go-&#xD;
queror, and the bold Frenchman, who in his turn was becoiscn-g&#xD;
lord of the soil,; Jews, bent on trafIfic ; haughty Turks, loaded&#xD;
with arms; graceful Greeks, in flowing fustanelles; -veiled&#xD;
.women, carrying water. from the. fountains:; trains of loaded&#xD;
camels, and other .novel sights,almost bewildered thenewly-&#xD;

arrived Europeans. But they had little time for observatbna,&#xD;
as the column to which they were detailed had already left, and&#xD;
was encamped a few miles out.&#xD;
The chasseurs were, generally speaking, delighted, with this&#xD;
prospect of being led at once into action; and as they approached&#xD;
the main body, they sang a wild war-song in .chorus with the&#xD;
rolling drums, making the time with their onward tramp. When&#xD;
they reached the campthey-found the regiments under arms to&#xD;
receive them, and were welcomed with loud cheers as-they filed&#xD;
. past to take their place onuthe extreme right-the post of honor.&#xD;
That night all wasImerriment around the blazing watchfires.&#xD;
Some came to obtain from the newly-arrived chasseurs news&#xD;
from home; others to offer them a soldier's welcome, and to&#xD;
drain the flasks - of the sutlers until they were empty. Every&#xD;
one had his questions to ask, or his song to sing, or his story to&#xD;
tell, and it was near daybreak ere they lay down around the&#xD;
-smouldering watch-fires.&#xD;
' The inspiring notes 6f the reveille restored animation to the&#xD;
bivouac. Baggage was packed, the orderlies bustled about, and&#xD;
soon the long column was in motion. At its. head were the chas-&#xD;
seurs, in their dark green uniforms, and marching with their&#xD;
light step to the sound of their martial clarions. Ere they had&#xD;
marched a league, there was a sudden quarrel between two&#xD;
sergeants of the company in which Clement and Harry had&#xD;
been drafted. Some old grudge had been revived; words led to&#xD;
,blows; and when the pugnacious combatants were ordered to&#xD;
the rear, Clement and his friend were ordered.to fill their places.&#xD;
"I told you so!" cried Harry. "Here we are, promoted the&#xD;
very first day. Keep up good courage, and all will yet be well.?&#xD;
Clement was indeed in his element, and rising to the post of&#xD;
orderly sergeant, his company was soon distinguished for its&#xD;
high discipline, and for the correctness with which it performed&#xD;
the difficult evolutions of the intricate drill. Military training in&#xD;
early life is sure to betray itself, and Clement found himself&#xD;
treated as an equal by his officers,-While his comrades respected&#xD;
his superior soldiership.&#xD;
Onward moved the column, its martia.J music echoing among&#xD;
steep hills and prefipitous ravines, while before them retreated&#xD;
the Arabs, :as the eagles flee -to the mountains, or the tigers to&#xD;
tihe jungles. Buit as. the invaders entered the broad plains&#xD;
before Constantinla, the horsemen would ride boldly up to the&#xD;
troops, firing their long muskets as. they advanced.. Then,&#xD;

drawing their sclmetars, and calling upon Allah, they would fall&#xD;
fiercely upon the troops, who would halt, form squares, and fire,&#xD;
while the agile chasseurs would harass the foe. Let the Arabs&#xD;
collect in inasses for the purpose of riding down these sharp-&#xD;
shooters, and the , light artillery would pour forth such a&#xD;
desolating storm of grapeshot, that the assailants would take&#xD;
flight.. The skirmish was ended.&#xD;
Two or .three of these attacks each day, with an occasional at-&#xD;
tempt at;surprise during the night, enlivened the tedious march;&#xD;
and, in- due time the column reached the city to be attacked.&#xD;
Then was it that the leader of the expedition arrived, escorted&#xD;
by a company of spahis, or native horsemen, and there was&#xD;
great curiosity to see. who had been sent as a commander. The&#xD;
field-pieces thundered forth a salute, 'the bands played, and as&#xD;
the general passed down. the line, welcomed by loud shouts,&#xD;
Clement's heart beat high with - joy. It was the veteran De&#xD;
Guyon. The wily Louis Philippe had won his allegiance by&#xD;
offering this coveted command.&#xD;
The arranged plans for storming the city of Constantina were&#xD;
approved, with some slight amendments, by General.de Guyon.&#xD;
The chasseurs. led the van, and on the captains drawing lots for&#xD;
the " forlorn hope," it was won by the company of which Clement&#xD;
was orderly sergeant. Onward they went, with noiseless steps,&#xD;
silent tongues and palpitating hearts, creeping, up the craggy&#xD;
height until beneath the low walls of the fortress. So near were&#xD;
they, that they could .distinctly hear the tramp . of the un-&#xD;
suspecting sentries. The stillness of death prevailed among the&#xD;
chasseurs, though the long and hard-drawn breath of the men,&#xD;
the nervous grasp with which they held their rifles, with sword&#xD;
bayonets fixed, and their eager attention for the signal, showed&#xD;
that their nerves were: well braced for the coming encounter.,&#xD;
Up went the-signal rocket. The drums on every hand beat&#xD;
the charge, and the measured tread of the different regiments&#xD;
advancing at double quick time, broke on the silence. of the&#xD;
still night, while within the fort all was confusion as the men&#xD;
hastened to their guns. The chasseurs remained 'Where they had&#xD;
been posted, eager for the fray, but too well disciplined to move.&#xD;
" Down, my braves--down 1" shouted Clement. And scarcely&#xD;
was the command obeyed, when. bright flashes shone forth from&#xD;
the embrazure above them, followed- by the reports of the-gun6&#xD;
as the grapeshlot crashed down through the, olive trees on the&#xD;
advancing troops. ." Now then! Onward !'&#xD;
&#xD;
$&#xD;
&#xD;
And with a cheer which rang high above the sharp volleys of&#xD;
musketry, the chasseurs leaped, like so many cats, up into the&#xD;
fortress. Now came the deadly strife, as bayonet gleamed against&#xD;
scimetar, and yataghan flashed against sword. Then came the&#xD;
din, the crash, the cry for quarter, and the agonizing sbrieks of&#xD;
the wounded, the chasseurs dashing madly forward, and the'&#xD;
Arabs resisting with the stubborn courage of men fighting for&#xD;
their homes.&#xD;
In the struggle, Clement saw advancing towards them, in the&#xD;
dim light of the morning, a green banner, one of the sacred&#xD;
ensigns of /Mahomet. "Forward-forward !" he shouted, and&#xD;
soon was at the side of the standard bearer, who defended his,&#xD;
trust with desperate valor. The conflict was of short duration,&#xD;
and Clement, with the captured standard in one hand, and&#xD;
reeking sword-bayonet in the other, rejoined his company, who&#xD;
received him with shouts of admiration.&#xD;
Now the French columns found their way into the fortress,&#xD;
and the deadly strife commenced, the chasseurs leading the van,&#xD;
with the green flag just -captured by Clement -waving in their&#xD;
midst. To the wildgshouts of conflict-the crash, the din, the&#xD;
tumult of the fight-an irregular fire now ensued, as the Arabs&#xD;
retreated within the barracks of the citadel.&#xD;
Just then, up galloped General de Guyon, and in an instant&#xD;
he ordered the light artillery to the spot. A volley from their&#xD;
pieces knocked the barrack doors into splinters, and he was&#xD;
about to order a charge, when a shot from the barracks struck&#xD;
his arm, and he sank forward on the neck of his horse.&#xD;
"No more fighting for me to-day," said he, as Clement sprang&#xD;
to his side. "But give the word to advance."&#xD;
" Forward! Revenge your general!" cried Clement, with a&#xD;
spirit-stirring energy that was answered by a shout from the&#xD;
chasseurs. They rushed into the barracks like an ocean wave,&#xD;
and the defeated foe were swept away like the drifting fragments&#xD;
of a wrecked frigate. In vain did the enemy resist, with bigoted&#xD;
courage; the chasseurs dashed madly forward where the foe&#xD;
stood thickest, and soon the victory was won.&#xD;
The Frenelh occup ied .Constantina, the proud citadel of Mos-&#xD;
lem tyranny, but fearful was the price paiti for it in human. blood.&#xD;
Among the mortally wounded was Harry Lawson, and when&#xD;
Clement found him, he was ghastly pale, the. blood streaming&#xD;
from a fearful sabre-cut on his head, though his countenance&#xD;
wore the pleasant smile of 'other days. Raising him on one&#xD;

knee, Clement put his canteen to his lips, and the swallows&#xD;
which he took appeared to revive him.&#xD;
"Clement," said he, "your luck has changed. " You Will-"&#xD;
But he spoke not aliother word. Hisunder jaw dropped; his&#xD;
head sank on one shoulder; he gave 'a convulsive groan; he&#xD;
was dead !,&#xD;
Sadly wailed the clarions of the chasseurs that afternoon, as&#xD;
Harry Lawson's corpse, wrapped in' 'an Arab cfoak, was deposited.&#xD;
in the ground. His frank and manly bearing had gained him&#xD;
many friends, and Clement mourned him as a brother lost.&#xD;
The next morning all the troops were drawn up in' a hollow'&#xD;
square, and the "general order' were read. "I am forgotten,"&#xD;
thought Clement, as name after name was mentioned; but his&#xD;
turn came. The staff-officer read:&#xD;
"Lastly, Orderly-sergeant Clement Clayton, of the chasseurs,&#xD;
having gallantly led the forlorn hope, been the flrst to enter the&#xD;
fortress, captured a sacred standard, and rendered the com-&#xD;
mander-in-chief important service at a critical moment, for&#xD;
these reasons he is decorated as knight of the Legion of Honor,&#xD;
promoted to a captaincy, and appointed aid-de-camp to General&#xD;
de Guyon."    -&#xD;
Clement heard no more, but fainted in the ranks. When lie&#xD;
recovered consciousness, he was in the general's quarters, and&#xD;
the kind-hearted veteran was bending over him with paternal&#xD;
solicitude.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
CAREERS OF CRIME&#xD;
&#xD;
-MR. JoHN SPENCER, after his father's death, and his marriage&#xD;
to a widow almost equally wealthy with himself, became one of&#xD;
the magnates. of New York. No one's name appeared oftener in&#xD;
the papers 'in connection with public schemes of improvement;&#xD;
no one gave mQre liberally to all 'tbose benevolent societies&#xD;
which published the names of' their donors, nor was there any&#xD;
one more frequently held up to the admiring gaze of the young&#xD;
as a "model merchant." Leaving the old mansion near the&#xD;
Battery, he Inhabited a splendid mansion in Bond street, and&#xD;
came down town every morning in his carriage, with two-trap-&#xD;

ping black fellows in livery. After business hours, however, he&#xD;
showed his want of pride by riding up Broadway in an omnibus,&#xD;
with a condescending air quite refreshing to behold.&#xD;
One day, on approaching his house withfhis usual consequen-&#xD;
tial step, the servant who let him in informed him that a man&#xD;
was in the parlor, waiting to see him.&#xD;
"Do you know who he is ?"&#xD;
"No, sir," replied the domestic, shrinkitig before the frowning&#xD;
gaze of his master; "but he seems queer-like."&#xD;
"Queer-like!"&#xD;
"Yes,.sir. He's very shabby, and I didn't like to let him in,&#xD;
but he wouldn't go fiWay. Hark, sir ! He's a singing."&#xD;
What audacity! Yes-some audacious intruder was actually&#xD;
singing a verse of" Coal-black 'Rose,"-the popular melody then.&#xD;
"Some fellow has mistaken the house, or is drunk !" angrily&#xD;
remarked the irritated merchant. "Go to the stable and tell&#xD;
James to come here. I may want him."&#xD;
Then, with his most imposing look, Mr. Spencer entered his&#xD;
parlor, where a bloated, vulgar-looking man sat in a luxurious&#xD;
chair, his dirty boots on the centre table, and a bad cigar in his&#xD;
mouth, which diffused anything but an agreeable perfume.&#xD;
"-Look here, sir," began the offended owner of the establish-&#xD;
inent; "how dare-" But when he had gotten thus far, he&#xD;
recognized the unbidden guest, and a feeling of agony almost&#xD;
took away his strength.&#xD;
"Yes, old covey-I dare. Of course, I dare come and see my&#xD;
old friend, for I knew you would be glad to see me."&#xD;
"Ah ! well-yes!" ejaculated the merchant, with a feeling of&#xD;
uneasiness which he vainly endeavored to shake off.&#xD;
"Of course. But you are slow."&#xD;
"Slow ?"&#xD;
"Yes, slow. Now were I you, John Spencer, I should have&#xD;
exclaimed, -as I entered the room, 'Goodness, my old- friend-&#xD;
Pike, how are you? I am, delighted to see you. Hallo, John,&#xD;
James, Thomas!'"&#xD;
" Here I anm, sir," said the coachman, rushing in as he heard&#xD;
his name called, and followed by the footman.&#xD;
"All' right," exclaimed Pike. ." Which of you has the wine in&#xD;
charge ?"&#xD;
." John, the footman," said Thomas, unable to divine what&#xD;
Was going on.&#xD;
" Well,'John, bring some sherry and crackers. Quick, sir I"&#xD;

&#xD;
The domestics vanished, leavipg their master In doubt as to&#xD;
whether he was awake or was the victim of a nightmare. A cold&#xD;
perspiration bathed his sallow face, and he felt incapable of&#xD;
action-&#xD;
"While waiting for the rosy old fellow," said Pike., "tell us&#xD;
how you are. You never play -now, I suppose ?"&#xD;
The afflicted man shook his head.&#xD;
" Never have one pack of cards in your hand and the other in&#xD;
your sleeve, eh ?"&#xD;
"It was you who taught me," muttered Spencer.&#xD;
"Yes-I rendered you a good many services, old boy. By&#xD;
the way, have you ever heard of Clement Spencer ?"&#xD;
"No. He was undoubtedly lost at sea."&#xD;
"Good for you, for do you know that will was not destroyed,&#xD;
after all."&#xD;
"What will?" eagerly inquired the terrified merchant, before&#xD;
whose vision dark shadows of the past began to flit.&#xD;
" What will" was the cool reply. "Now you must have a&#xD;
very bad memory. Shall I tell you the story to refresh it ?"&#xD;
"I know of no will," doggedly remarked Mr. Spencer.&#xD;
"That's true. But do you remember hunting for one once,&#xD;
with that old fox, your father, when his brother lay dead in the&#xD;
house? Aha! your recollection is improving, for you change&#xD;
color."I&#xD;
"Had we not a right to search, being the nearest relatives ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps you had, but if you had been smarter you would&#xD;
have found it, as Egan did."&#xD;
"What I Did that drunken rascal find a will ?"&#xD;
"That you will some day find out, old covey. I-was away at&#xD;
the time, you know, managing matters so as to get that young&#xD;
cadet into trouble. It was not a badly laid scheme, after all,to&#xD;
get that crazy fool into a quarrel with him, and then, after trip-&#xD;
ping him up by a cord across the path, to take his own pistol,&#xD;
and give the other a flesh wound. Prompt decision carried it&#xD;
through; eh ?"&#xD;
" But all this is past," muttered the agonized merchant'.&#xD;
"Not at all-not at all," replied Pike, with a cunning leer.&#xD;
"Egan is alive, and so is his wife, who has kept your uncle's&#xD;
will like the apple of her eye. How would you like to give up&#xD;
those coal mines, my boy ?"&#xD;
The servant now brought in a waiter, with a decanter of wine&#xD;

and -some biscuit. Filling a glass, Pike tossed It- off, and then&#xD;
replenished it.&#xD;
"Good wine, Spencer; better than what we used to get when&#xD;
we went about disguised. Rare times, those, though."&#xD;
"But I thought you went away ?" asked -the agonized&#xD;
merchant. "I thought my father paid you to leave ?"&#xD;
"So he did. He laid down the cash, and threatened to indict&#xD;
me if I came back. So I went to the other side of the pond, but&#xD;
luck has of late been bad-very bad. What could I do better&#xD;
than to come back again and see my old friends ?"&#xD;
" Vell."&#xD;
"Well!" mimicked Pike. "Is that your greeting to the old&#xD;
professor, who gave you lessons in what has enabled you to get&#xD;
"Do you mean to say that I have got rich by gambling ?"&#xD;
"Yes-not perhaps with cards, but with stocks and mer-&#xD;

"Thousands! Why, did not my father pay yod for your&#xD;
villany?"&#xD;
" Very well. With his-letters, and what testimony I can pick&#xD;
up, quite a pretty early history of your honorable meanness can&#xD;
be written. Here goes for-a row, if you say so."&#xD;
"fHush-hushI" said John Spencer, who heard his carriage&#xD;
draw up before the door.- "I will do what is right.",&#xD;
"AhaI" cried Pike, with a look of malignant triumph. "You&#xD;
are afraid, after alL Well, be liberal."&#xD;
" Here, take my purse," said the merchant. "It contains&#xD;
over a hundred dollars, and if you will meet me to-morrow, I&#xD;
will endeayor to satisfy you."&#xD;
"Meet you where"&#xD;
"Anywhere. Stay. I will pass by the arsenal in Centre street&#xD;
in my carriage, about two clock, and take you in. We can&#xD;
ride out to the ' Red Cottage,' and there arrange our business."&#xD;
"Agreed. I knew you would be generous," said Pike, taking&#xD;
another glass of sherry, and lingering along as hewent to the&#xD;
door, as if examining the h~ouse. Each moment seemed an age,&#xD;
and when the door fairly closed, he drew a long breath. Then&#xD;
came the consciousness that the respite was but a . temporary&#xD;
one. Never mind. Terms can be and must be made.&#xD;
"Who was your visitor ?" asked Mrs. Spencer, sweeping&#xD;
majestically into the room. "Pshaw ! I smell tobacco smoke.&#xD;

I.&#xD;
&#xD;
The troubled husband stammered out an apology, but all that&#xD;
night his mind was ill at ease. His troubled imagination peopled&#xD;
the silence of his chamber, as though the memories of the past&#xD;
could assume an actual existence, and he determined to have the&#xD;
troublesome Pike removed, whatever might be the cost. Had&#xD;
he dared, he would have hired'him to be assassinated; as It was,&#xD;
he determined to use gold instead of steel.'&#xD;
T he next day, Pike and Meredith Egai emerged from that&#xD;
rotten core of New York's heart-the Five Points, and were&#xD;
lounging along the sidewalk in front of the arsenal, when the&#xD;
rich merchant drove up.&#xD;
"What !" was his exclamation, when they approached the&#xD;
door of the carriage, as it stopped; "two of you?"&#xD;
"Yes," coolly remarked Pike, as he handed his companion&#xD;
into the carriage. "We work in couples, old fellow, just as you&#xD;
and I used to pluck pigeons when you was my pupil. You&#xD;
really have done credit to my lessons."&#xD;
"Where shall I drive to?" inquired the coachman.&#xD;
"The Red Cottage."&#xD;
This was a somewhat equivocal resort in what was then the&#xD;
suburbs of the city, although its site is now covered by blocks&#xD;
of magnificent houses. To Mr. Spencer's great joy, Pike pro-&#xD;
posed, without ceremony, that the troublesome witnesses should&#xD;
all go abroad; and then came the sum to be paid them, in which&#xD;
the merchant wished to include a delivery of the will. The will,&#xD;
however, appeared out of' the question, as Egan denied all&#xD;
knowledge of it, while Pike had even forgotten his allusion to it&#xD;
the previous evening. The price of the exile was then discussed,&#xD;
Spencer and Pike haggling like tigers quarrelling for their prey.&#xD;
"An exposure would not be agreeable," sneeringly remarked&#xD;
Pike.&#xD;
"Neither would it be in any way profitable," was the reply.&#xD;
"Well, say ten thousand dollars."&#xD;
" Ten thousand furies !" shouted Mr. Spencer, knitting his&#xD;
brow and grinding his teeth. "I would not give that sum to&#xD;
save your lives."~&#xD;
"I don't believe you would," was the cool reply.&#xD;
At last, after a protracted discussion, which was in fact a&#xD;
tournament of rascality, it was agreed that each should receive&#xD;
one hundred dollars, with an annuity of five' hundred, to be&#xD;
paid quarterly in Paris, so long as they remained there. Pike&#xD;
had evidently made inquiries on the subject, for he insisted on&#xD;

having the business closed before the French consul, where the&#xD;
terrified merchant reluctantly signed the papers, and deposited&#xD;
a bond that the annuity should be forthcoming. Verily doth,&#xD;
" conscience make cowards of us all."&#xD;
It was a week before a vessel was to sail for Havre, and at the&#xD;
request of Egan's wife,. the "witnesses," as Pike called the trio,&#xD;
went to Brooklyn. The night.before they were to sail, John&#xD;
Spencer sat communing with his gloomy thoughts, biting his&#xD;
lips with rage, and a prey-not only to the anguish of remorse,&#xD;
but to the mortification of having to pay so largely for silence.&#xD;
All at once he thought of the will. Did it exist ? Would it be&#xD;
used for further extortion?&#xD;
Uneasy and troubled in spirit, he determined to go and see&#xD;
the "witnesses' again, although he had bidden them-and'&#xD;
gladly, too-.farewell. It was' a ra w, foggy night, and a servant,&#xD;
who was in the hall as the merchant went out, noticed that his&#xD;
master had a haggard, vacant look, as if his thoughts were&#xD;
wandering. Onward -he strode, often jostling rudely against&#xD;
passers-by, for so dense was the fog that it was not easy to dis-&#xD;
tinguish objects in the dark streets. The ferry was reached;&#xD;
the' river was crossed; but ere the boat was made fast, the&#xD;
heart-stricken man pushed forward, and fell between the wharf&#xD;
and the boat, his head striking the edge of the platform.&#xD;
There was a stifled shriek-a plash in the g    waves.&#xD;
For a moment the wounded and drowning man struggled con-&#xD;
vulsively, his blood crimsoning the foaming waters around him.&#xD;
BAt when the boat was backed from the wharf, and search was&#xD;
made for the unknown' victim to his own impetuosity,. no trace&#xD;
of him could be found. John Spencer had ended his successful&#xD;
yet crime-stamped career. 'His body was swept down the har-&#xD;
bor by a strong ebbing tide, and his disembodied spirit passed&#xD;

was at an end, and the army having retired into winter quarters,&#xD;
the veteran received orders to repair without delay. to Paris.&#xD;
The king wished to learn the exact condition of affairs in,&#xD;
Algeria; nor was the general at all backward in obeying the&#xD;
invitation, although he found it.difficult to persuade his aid-de-&#xD;
camp to accompany him. Clement's recollections of the me-&#xD;
tropolis were anything but agreeable, yet he. was so necessary&#xD;
to the comfort of the general, who doted on him as he would&#xD;
have doted on a son, that there was no evading the visit-&#xD;
The .general took a suite of furnished apartments in the&#xD;
faubourg St. Honore, and soon the "hero of Constantina" was&#xD;
the lion of fashionable society. His presence was expected at&#xD;
the palace festivities.; he was enticed to all the balls; no dinner&#xD;
was a success if he was not present, and tickets to concerts aM.dd&#xD;
theatrical representations were showered upon him. Of course,&#xD;
his handsome aid-de-camp was always expected to accompany,&#xD;
him, and a great difference there was between that gallant&#xD;
soldier, in his dashing chasseur uniform, and the half-starved&#xD;
man of letters who not a year previous felt life a burthen. Yet&#xD;
Clement was not spoiled by prosperity, and though he mingled&#xD;
in the gaieties of the magnificent court, his thoughts often&#xD;
reverted to poor Harry Lawson, to whose advice he owed his&#xD;
present position. Nay, memory, faithful to her trust, would call'&#xD;
up other and earlier -pages in his life. Fascinating as were the&#xD;
Parisian belles, his heart was sealed with fond thoughts of Ida&#xD;
Patterson.&#xD;
One night, having been with General de Guyon to a brilliant&#xD;
festival, he found it impossible to sleep. His health was good;&#xD;
nothing had occurred during the day to annoy him, and yet,&#xD;
though ie would perseveringly close his eyes, they would not&#xD;
remain closed. -A profound stillness reighed, only broken by the&#xD;
occasional tramp 6f a passing patrol; but at length Clement&#xD;

heard, or fancied he hedrd, something which sounded like the&#xD;
sawing of wood in -the next room, where General de Guyon slept.&#xD;
Then there was a noise like the unlocking of a door; but after&#xD;
all, he thought, it might be one of the sounds heard in all old&#xD;
houses, and turning, he again endeavored to sleep.&#xD;
A noise again! (ould it be that the general was ill? Spring-&#xD;
Ing from his bed, he was already approaching the door between&#xD;
the rooms, when he heard the well-known voice of General de&#xD;
Guyon exclaiming, in half-suppressed tones. "Robbers I&#xD;
robbersI"&#xD;
Rushing in, Clement found a man endeavoring to hold a pillow&#xD;
over the general's mouth, while a second had aimed a blow at&#xD;
his head with a club. Planting a blow of his fist just beneath&#xD;
the ear of the first one, Clement seized the other around the&#xD;
body, holding him fast, in spite of his struggles to escape. The&#xD;
general, jumping pp, and seizing his uniform sash, which lay on&#xD;
a chair, bound the man whom Clement had knocked senseless,&#xD;
and by that time a party o' police entered the room.&#xD;
What words had been interchanged between General de&#xD;
Guyon and Clement, were in the French language, and the faint&#xD;
light of the night-lamp had not enabled them to see their&#xD;
prisoners. But no sooner were lights brought than the man&#xD;
secured by Clement exclaimed, with all affrighted air:&#xD;
"Clement Spencer-Clem   Spencer! Is it you, or do I&#xD;
dream?"&#xD;
"Never mind treating us to your English," said a police&#xD;
officer, putting on a pair of hand-cuffs. "You are caught in the&#xD;
act, and the way in which that door has been sawed out to let&#xD;
you put in your arm to turn the key, shows that you are- no&#xD;
novice at the business."&#xD;
Clement Spencer! It was long since the owner of that name&#xD;
had heard it, and he was hesitating whether to acknowledge it,&#xD;
when the other man. said:&#xD;
"Ah, Clement, little did I use to think when holding you on&#xD;
my knee at Coalboro', that you would give me up to these&#xD;
French police I. But it's no use. My conscience has never been,&#xD;
easy since I did you a wrong, and I hope now my old 'oman will&#xD;
set you right."&#xD;
"Egan!I" exclaimed Clement. " Is that you, Egan ?"&#xD;
" It is,'' replied the other culprit, " and I am none other than&#xD;
Ichabod Pike, once professor, but now prisoner?'&#xD;
" What are those men talking about ?" asked General de Guyon.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Sir," said Pike, in excellent French, "although we are&#xD;
criminals, we have it in our power to restore to our captor a&#xD;
fortune--nay, we can give him af-name.".&#xD;
"What " exclaimed Clement, "Do you know anything&#xD;
about my history ?"&#xD;
" Everything," was the reply.&#xD;
"Tell me, then, who-"&#xD;
"Nay," interrupted Pike. "One cannot be -confidential with&#xD;
pair of hand-cuffs on. When we are free again, we may be&#xD;
communicative. So, gentlemen officers, let us go on. 'If this&#xD;
young.man sees us clear of this scrape, we may enlighten him&#xD;
as to his parentage.",&#xD;
No sooneretwere they away, than General de Guyon, whose&#xD;
curiosity had been strongly excited during this conversation,&#xD;
demanded an explanation. Hitherto, Clement had never gone&#xD;
through with the sad detail of his history, but now he told him&#xD;
all- that he knew&#xD;
"M ty friend," said the general, when he had learned all, " we&#xD;
must 'lose no time in unravelling this mystery. First, let us&#xD;
visit the American minister, immediately after bre'akfast, and-&#xD;
endeavor to ascertain if this Egan is accompanied by his wife-&#xD;
your nurse, I think you said. If they have not had their pass-&#xD;
ports countersigned at* the embassy, we must employ some of&#xD;
the detective police."&#xD;
The Amerian minister, they learned, had just arrived at&#xD;
Paris, nor did their informant know his name. Driving to. the&#xD;
embassy, they requested an audience, and were invited into a&#xD;
drawing-room. A gentleman who sat at the table, writing,&#xD;
rose   reive them  but no sooner did Clement see his familar&#xD;
features, than he sprang forward, exclaimIng    .&#xD;
"My old friend, Mr. Ledroit, I did not expect to see- you&#xD;
here 1P&#xD;
The recognition was not at first mutual, for Mr. Ledroit did&#xD;
not recognize in the stalwart, weather-bronzed soldier the strip-&#xD;
n rwhoz had ont esed his life, and whom he had long&#xD;
rengarded hadead.e rBut when he clarly comprehended who it&#xD;
was, he clasped the gallant soldier to his heart, exclaiming.:&#xD;
" My son! my son! Heaven be praised that I have found my&#xD;
s''-it was his child. It was he who had married the, elder&#xD;
sister of John Spencer, and she, left destitute and disowned by&#xD;
her' cruel father, had journeyed to Coalboro', and there ,placed&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Iyer babe under the protection of her Uncle Clement, While she&#xD;
sought her husband. The letter explained all, and the kind,&#xD;
hearted uncle gave the child his own name, intending to adopt&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The poor mother never reached her husband, nor did he know&#xD;
that he was a father, until his child providentially saved his life.&#xD;
Then, Mr. Clement Spencer told him all; but as Mr. Ledroit&#xD;
had never told the secret of his life to his mother, it was agreed&#xD;
between them that it should -remain inviolate for a time.&#xD;
Meanwhile, the delighted father obtained'a cadetship for his&#xD;
son, and would have secured his advancement had he not been&#xD;
away at Mr. Spencer's death, and knew not thp^61ain of events that&#xD;
followed it. No sooner did he learn them, than he hastened to&#xD;
the North, but the John -Spencers denied any knowledge of&#xD;
Clement, neither could the slightest proof of his parentage be&#xD;
obtained at Coalboro'. Mrs. Egan, who was the only person&#xD;
who might have known any of the facts, had suddenly left a few&#xD;
weeks before, with her husband.&#xD;
All- this, With many .a detail, was told by Mr. Ledroit to his&#xD;
son-to the child of her whom he loved, and upon whom he now&#xD;
gazed with paternal pride. To Clement, it seemed like a dream&#xD;
from which he feared to awake. The dark clouds which had low-&#xD;
ered over the horizon of his hopes for many a long year, were&#xD;
now breaking away, and the world seemed brighter than ithad&#xD;
ever appeared before.&#xD;
But," suddenly exclaimed General de Guyon, for whose&#xD;
benefit the conversation had been carried on in French, "should&#xD;
we not endeavor to find this Mrs. Egan ?"&#xD;
The suggestion was valuable, and driving.to the police depart-&#xD;
ment, a detective officer was sent to conduct them to her abode.&#xD;
It was in the midst of that nest of crime known as "the city,"&#xD;
where vice and crime herd together, haggard with misery, or a&#xD;
prey to their own depraved appetites. The- door of Mrs. Egan's4A&#xD;
room having been indicated, Clement knocked, but could scarcely'&#xD;
recognize his old nurse in the attenuated woman who let him in.&#xD;
Trouble had evidently cast a ghastly shadow over her haggard&#xD;
cheeks, and she gazed wildly at the stranger with her sunken1&#xD;
blood-shot eyes. But she recognized him.,-&#xD;
" Yes, yes," she convulsively exclaimed, ''It is my boy-my&#xD;
little Clem! Little did I ever expect to see you again, but I&#xD;
have hereuwhat will make your heart as glad as it will mine to&#xD;

THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;
Going to an old trunk in the corner, she produced a package&#xD;
of papers marked "For Clement Spencer."&#xD;
"There," said she. "When the good man who wrote that had&#xD;
breathed his last, I was sent by his hard-hearted brother for a&#xD;
locksmith. Knowing that my poor husband was too much an&#xD;
adept at the business, I besought him, charging him, by all that&#xD;
was sacred, to keep a lookout for anything of this kind. It was&#xD;
found. by him, when your unlooked-for arrival diverted the&#xD;
hunters from their search, and for once he kept his pledge.&#xD;
But you, Clem, was not to be found; nay, they said you had&#xD;
absconded-that you was drowned; but I cared not. Death&#xD;
only could have made me part with the package, unless to&#xD;
deliver it, as I now have, into your own hands."&#xD;
After thanking the unfortunate woman, Clement carefully&#xD;
broke the sad tidings of her husband's capture to her, assuring&#xD;
her that no effort should be spared to have his punishment as&#xD;
light as possible. Leaving his purse with.her, he rejoined his&#xD;
friends in the carriage and communicated his good fortune.&#xD;
Breaking the seals of the package, his eyes filled with tears,&#xD;
for there were the mementoes of his mother, found with him&#xD;
when left at Mr. Spencer's door. Mr. Ledroit, too, wept-bitter-&#xD;
ly, especially when he perused the letter from his wife to her&#xD;
uncle, commending the helpless infant, and hoping that he soon-&#xD;
could be reclaimed by his father. Alas, how many years had&#xD;
Intervened, yet the father found that his heart yearned towards&#xD;
that son, and Clement's heart swelled with joy to think that.&#xD;
there was no stain upon his birthI&#xD;
There was another paper in the package. It was a will, made&#xD;
by Clement Spencer, bequeathing all his property, "both real&#xD;
and personal, to his well-beloved nephew and namesake."&#xD;
Francois Ledroit and Martha Gray -were the witnesses.&#xD;
"1I knew," said Mr. Ledroit, "that this docuinent must have&#xD;
mysteriously disappeared, or have been destroyed by the&#xD;
Spencers. But as no statement of mine could have stripped-&#xD;
them of their ill-gotten gains, and you, my dear Clement, was&#xD;
supposed to be drowned, I thought it best to hold mny peace.&#xD;
But eomne; your oldfriend Clayton is to dine with me to-day,&#xD;
and you must see my sister, and a child of my adoption, who&#xD;
are matronizing my bachelor establishment."&#xD;
Clement looked towards General de Guyon.&#xD;
" Of course," ,ontinued Mr. Ledroit, " your friend, the general,&#xD;
will accompany you. I fear that I have robbed him of' a~ son-"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WEST POINT CADET.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
But the happiness of my young friend reconciles me to the&#xD;
loss," interrupted the general. "Yet I do confess that I envy&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" Thanks; but I have to dine at the palace. I will excuse my&#xD;
aid-de-camp, though, and call in the evening. Adieu 1"&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALL'S WELL~ THAT ENDS WELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
, Ox reaching the American embassy, Mr. Ledroit was told by&#xD;
the porter that a messenger from the foreign office was waiting&#xD;
in his study, and-requested a servant to usher Clement into the&#xD;
drawing-room, promising to follow in a few moments. As the&#xD;
domestic opened the door, the well-known notes of the "Cadet's&#xD;
Quickstep1" (so familiar in his early life, but so long unheard)&#xD;
met his ear; but the lady who was seated at the piano stopped&#xD;
playing when she saw a stranger, and rose to leave the instru-&#xD;
ment. As- she turned, the astonished young man saw the loved&#xD;
face that had for years haunted his day-reveries and his night-&#xD;
dreams. True,,time had added dignity and maturity to its&#xD;
beauty, but from her eyes came the same sunshine of the heart,&#xD;
which hadso long been clouded. All the old current of first&#xD;
and never-quenched love rushed back upon his heart, and he&#xD;
stood bewildered and astonished.&#xD;
Ida Patterson, equally bewildered, pressed her outspread&#xD;
hands upon her forehead, as if fearing that the grave had given&#xD;
up the dead to torture her with vague fantasies, while a look of&#xD;
profound astonishment took possession of her pale countenance.&#xD;
It deepened, and as snow becomes luminous when the sunshine&#xD;
plays over it, the very pallor of her features brightened with&#xD;
affection.&#xD;
"Ida 1"&#xD;
With a convulsive bound, she sprang into his out-stretched&#xD;
arms, and exclaiming, "Clement!" she burst into a flood of tears,&#xD;
while he folded her to his proud heart. At first she wept&#xD;
hysterically, but when he poured forth the love that for so many&#xD;
years had been garnered up for her alone, the crimson blushes&#xD;
again stole over her cheek, and joy-smiles dispelled the heart-&#xD;
darkness of the past, as gleams of spring sunshine melt the snow-&#xD;

&#xD;
banks. The lighthearted girl, who had awakened the cadet's love,&#xD;
had changed into the.matured, sorrow-tried, soul-inspired woman,.&#xD;
"Clement," she murmured, "you have-not forgotten me."&#xD;
"Forgotten you! 0, Ida, you have never thought so! I&#xD;
know you never have."&#xD;
" Never !" she whispered, lifting her tearful eyes to meet his&#xD;
gaze; "never I"&#xD;
Again did he pour forth his vows, not as before in that quiet&#xD;
garden at West Point, bright dreams of romance, but earnest&#xD;
hopes that she would never again be separated from him, in a&#xD;
world which neither, had thus far found an enchanted valley of&#xD;
bliss. Years had passed since that firAt declaration, yet tones&#xD;
that had since been buried, now welled forth again beneath the&#xD;
burning breath of love. Happiness, which had been at a stand-&#xD;
still, now started afresh.&#xD;
" What !- Do I dream!1" exclaimed the well-known voice of Mr.&#xD;
Ledroit, who had entered the room without having been heard.&#xD;
" Ah, it is like a dream," said Clement, "yet I hope there will&#xD;
be no awakening ! My father, let me tell you that this is my&#xD;
long-plighted bride.".&#xD;
Mr. Ledrot saw it all;- and the love, long treasured in his own&#xD;
heart that Ida might become his wife, was changed to an equal&#xD;
devotion for her as the promised bride of his newly-found son.&#xD;
"Bless you, my children!I" said he, in a voice choked by&#xD;
emotion. "Now, Ida, the wish of my poor mother' will be&#xD;
gratified, and you will be mistress of that Southern home where&#xD;
you won all hearts."&#xD;
But therehwasanother surprise in store for them-another&#xD;
recognition-anot'her resurrection of past love. For when&#xD;
General de Guyon came, no sooner was he presented to Ida,&#xD;
than lie exclaimed: "Cecile, my poor, dear wife!"&#xD;
It was not his Cecile, but her daughter. Yes-there was the&#xD;
same auburn hair, the deep blue eyes, the classical features, and&#xD;
the elastic, queen-like form, which had won his youthful heart.&#xD;
Ida well knew, too, that her mother's first husband had been the&#xD;
C" True, true '" said he; " I yet own the broad domain of Chau-&#xD;
mont, although .when I found myself saved from the guilotine&#xD;
by the overthrow of Robespierre, I dared not retain a name&#xD;
which smacked of nobility.; I learned, too, that my dear wife-&#xD;
my poor, poor Cecile, had perished at sea while .escaping to&#xD;
England, and in the bitterness of my grief I enlisted. . From that&#xD;
&#xD;
time, glory has been my Idol, until this brave young man stepped&#xD;
between me and death. . To-day, Mr. Ledroit, you take him&#xD;
from me-you claim him as a son, but let me love as a daughter&#xD;
this child of my dear wife."&#xD;
But why proceed to describe a re-union of fond hearts, where&#xD;
all was happiness? .Soon, leaving the two elderly gentlemen to&#xD;
discuss plans for ,their future happiness, the lovers went out to&#xD;
stroll in the Tuilleries, that regal retreat. It was a lovely night,&#xD;
and the moon moved on in majesty overhead with her glittering&#xD;
attendant train, while above the hum of the busy city came the&#xD;
softened music of the martial band performing beneath the palace&#xD;
windows. Yet it is doubtful whether either Clement or Ida heard&#xD;
or saw anything above or around. Pacing slowly along a seclud&#xD;
ed walk, with his arm gently encircling her waist, he told his won-&#xD;
derful tale of life, through the varied warp and woof of which ran&#xD;
the bright, unbroken golden thread of his love for her. Joyously&#xD;
did they re-unite the links of the magic chain of life, happy in&#xD;
the noblest, purest, holiest of passions-reciprocated love.&#xD;
The wedding-day came at length, and the American embassy&#xD;
was thronged with the great and the gay of Paris. Grave diplo-&#xD;
matists, grave academicians, dashing soldiers and profound,&#xD;
statesmen were there in crowds, mingled with fair ladies, spark-&#xD;
ling with jewels. Yet among all that gay throng, neither, the&#xD;
brilliant appearance of the saloons, or the exquisite music, or&#xD;
the splendor of the uniforms, or the seintillations of -jewelry, or&#xD;
the waving of feathers, or the rustling of brocades, could attract&#xD;
the delighted gaze of the crowd from the happy couple whose&#xD;
marriage was there celebrated.&#xD;
Clement Spencer, in his dashing uniform of captain of chas-&#xD;
seurs, was an almost entirely different person from the cadet,m&#xD;
simple gray, who first wooed his bride,o less handsome than&#xD;
when then exultant in youthful hope, but with a, nobler and&#xD;
sterner beauty. And Ida Patterson-so called for the last time,.&#xD;
-was changed from the laughing girl into the regally mature&#xD;
woman, with a brow on which thought reposed as on, an ivory&#xD;
throrre, while deep tenderness lurked in her true eyes.&#xD;
The solemn vows were pronounced ; the cilip of their happi--&#xD;
ness was filled to the brim. General de Guyon gave the bride&#xD;
away, while Walter Clayton and Isabel Ledroit, as groomsman&#xD;
and bridesmaid, rejoiced in the happiness -of their friends.&#xD;

&#xD;
It may not be amiss to turn over another leaf, now that another&#xD;
score of years have passed. Soon after his marriage, Clement&#xD;
resigned his commission, and the whole party came to America,&#xD;
accompanied by Pike and the Egans, General de Guyon's influ-&#xD;
ence having stopped all legal proceedings for' the attempt at rob-&#xD;
bery. At first, Mrs. John Spencer refused to relinquish her hus-&#xD;
band's ill-gotten gains, but she at last thought it best not to&#xD;
brave legal inquiry, and a decent curtain was thus dropped over&#xD;
his conduct, while a costly monument, erected over his remains&#xD;
after their discovery, blazons his virtues. "Requiescat in pace !"&#xD;
General de.Guyon is also gathered to his fathers, full of years&#xD;
and of honors, but happier in his last years in the devoted care&#xD;
of his wife's daughter. Mr. Ledroit yet lives at his southern&#xD;
home, doubly happy. Not only has he around him Clement and&#xD;
Ida, with their little ones, but Walter Clayton, the happy husband&#xD;
of his sister IsabeL&#xD;
One bright day last summer, Clement Spencer returned from&#xD;
New Orleans, and among the purchases which he brought home,&#xD;
was a large case of toys. Its advent was hailed with glee by&#xD;
the children who collected around, with the pleasures of&#xD;
anticipation gushing from their hearts.&#xD;
"What have you there 2" asked the buxom matron, who held&#xD;
her youngest cherub in her arms.&#xD;
"A new amusement, Ida," replied the proud father, "-probably&#xD;
brought out by the Russian war. Here are full sets of chasseur&#xD;
uniforms and equipments for the two eldest boys."&#xD;
"And me1" sadly exclaimed a younger brother--" 'o uniform&#xD;
for me ?"&#xD;
"Never mind, Clem," said the mother. "I will have you made&#xD;
a uniform Which I like better than that foreign finery. You&#xD;
shall be an American cadet."&#xD;
"HuzzaI" exclaimed a gray-haired old gentlenian, who en-&#xD;
joyed the sports of those who were little more'childish than&#xD;
himself.- "Huzza! Grandpa can then see together cadet and&#xD;

Such was the message, traced in a clear, bold, but rapid hand,&#xD;
on a slip of paper, which Marian Winthrop had found amid a&#xD;
bouquet of Cornwall wild-flowers, that had suddenly dropped&#xD;
at her feet, as she sat dreaming in a secluded nook of a pleasant&#xD;
old English manse. A-pretty picture she made, sitting there&#xD;
beneath.the great pear-tree, 'with her slight, but exquisitely&#xD;
graceful figure, her fair, Saxon face, with its vivid color, and&#xD;
strong lights and shadows, and the sunshine, which sifted&#xD;
through the gnarled boughs, glinting across a wealth of tresses&#xD;
that seemed like bronzed gold. Had you seen her then, as she&#xD;
sprang from her seat, a warm blush crimsoning cheek, neck&#xD;
and brow, at the request, penned in her anonymous note, and&#xD;
a smile dimpling her ripe, red lips, you would not have wondered&#xD;
that she was -the belle of the- country, and that even in far-oW&#xD;
London, they talked of the beautiful Marian Winthrop.&#xD;

"It must have been froi Laurence," she exclaimed, glancing&#xD;
again at the bouquet, and the note, and stealthily lifting the&#xD;
flowers to her lips-" He has written the message, and dropped&#xD;
the bouquet at my feet, and I am sure he must be near. Per-&#xD;
haps I shall find him lurking among the shrubbery I" With&#xD;
these words, she darted away, the same arch smile on her face,&#xD;
and her bright eyes sparkling with fun and frolic.&#xD;
Her search for Laurence Verner proved vain, though she shook&#xD;
the rose-bushes and laburnums, till a fragrant rain fell around&#xD;
her, and half-a-dozen birds soared from their nestsin dismay.&#xD;
The only person to be found was a stranger boy, and though&#xD;
she doubted not he had been the bearer of the young man's&#xD;
note, she was too timid to question him as to its authorship, or&#xD;
his own agency in transmitting it. He passed on, whistling a&#xD;
snatch of some old tune, and she drew back, shy and silent.&#xD;
All day Marian Winthrop' was dreamy and pre-occupied, and&#xD;
when the hall-clock struck ten, she stole down the winding oak&#xD;
stair-case, and noiselessly quitted the house. The hush of the&#xD;
summer night had settled on the landscape, and wild moor,&#xD;
bold crag, and the wayward path of the mountain stream were&#xD;
wrapped in soft shadows. The moon was just rising above the&#xD;
distant heights, outlined sharply against the sky, when Marian.&#xD;
glided by the gray-walled church, and paused by the ruined&#xD;
Oratory, which marks the sacred well of St Clare. Ages ago,&#xD;
as our readers will recollect, this region was famous for its&#xD;
Druid temples and worship,.and it may be dark-eyed priestesses&#xD;
had trailed their white robes along the brink of the fountain I&#xD;
am describing. Years later, the Cornwall legends tell us that&#xD;
the well was hallowed by its patron Saint -, "a noble Italian&#xD;
woman and a disciple of St. Francis, who, abandoning the most&#xD;
brilliant worldly prospects, dedicated herself to the interests&#xD;
of religion." Hence-the spring derived its name from the Ab-&#xD;
bess of the Benedictine Nuns, and though St. Clare had long&#xD;
since mouldered back to dust, the little pool was still associated&#xD;
with her memory, and regarded with superstitious awe by many&#xD;
of the ignorant- country people. Marian Winthrop, however',&#xD;
felt no fear, as she trod the fallen stones, which had once been&#xD;
arches, and cornices, and moulings of the Oratory, and stopped&#xD;
in. the very shadow of the moss-grown cross hard by. She had&#xD;
been there but a few moments, when a tall form bounded to-&#xD;
ward her, and a deep-toned voice exclaimed:-&#xD;
" Dear, dear Marian!I&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
family 2?"&#xD;
"Mark, you have no right toquestion me&#xD;
you that I could not return your love, and&#xD;
Do not persecute me with attentions that are&#xD;
heart take its own course."&#xD;
"You are requiring a hard thing--I shall&#xD;
you up to Laurence Verner!"&#xD;
There was such firmness in his tone and&#xD;
&#xD;
thus; I have told&#xD;
this is sufficient.&#xD;
odious, but let my&#xD;
never, never give&#xD;
look, that Marian&#xD;
&#xD;
Winthrop trembled at the thought of having a mail like Mark&#xD;
Aylesford for an enemy, and she paced the- grass and stones&#xD;
beside him, silent and thoughtful. Gradually the frown left his&#xD;
brow, his lip lost its rigidity, and he once more grew 'genial and&#xD;
tender. Marian dared not refuse his escort home, and they&#xD;
parted at the door of the quaint, many-gabled stone mansion&#xD;
with a show of courtesy, which was quite foreign to her real&#xD;
feelings.&#xD;
While these events were transpiring in the vicinity of the&#xD;
sacred well, a young man, whose symmetrical and well-knit&#xD;
form, and. frank, handsome face would have rendered him a&#xD;
&#xD;
The girl started In. surprise and disappointment, and In spite&#xD;
of her natural good breeding, shrank from her companion in&#xD;
involuntary disgust.&#xD;
" Marcus Aylesford," she cried, "why are you here ?"&#xD;
"Why, my sweet Marian?   Do you ask that, when I sent&#xD;
you a message, begging you to walk to-night by the brink of&#xD;
the Holy Well?"&#xD;
" I, I have been sadly deceived," said Marian, withgrave&#xD;
earnestness.&#xD;
"And it was not me, with whom you expected to hold a&#xD;
tryst ?"&#xD;
"No, no, you are the last person I supposed to be the author&#xD;
of the note I found in the bouquet, that was flung at my feet&#xD;
this morning, and had I suspected it, you would have walked&#xD;
alone by the brink of the Sacred Well."&#xD;
"Upon my word, you are complimentary," observed Ayles-&#xD;
ford with a curling lip, while a fierce glitter shot into his fiery&#xD;
eyes--" I suppose you would have preferred a meeting with&#xD;
Laurence Verner!"&#xD;
1" Vastly sir," replied the girl, with a nonchalance that was&#xD;
tantalizing.&#xD;
" Marian Winthrop, you drive me iad-have you dared love&#xD;
that young boor, whose very name is hateful to me and your&#xD;

dangerous rival to almost any suitor In the kingdom, struck&#xD;
into abroad sweep of moorland, and took his way through the&#xD;
thick furze, dusky heath, and huge masses of granite as fast as&#xD;
his supple limbs could carry him. He had gone but a short dis-&#xD;
tance when a rifle ball came whizzing through the air, and&#xD;
glanced harmlessly past hin. At the same time a burly ruffian&#xD;
rose from a clump of furz, muttering:&#xD;
"You are on forbidden ground-this Cornish moor is the&#xD;
highwayman's park, and we allow no poaching. Your money&#xD;
or your life, stranger!"&#xD;
"My purse is too ineagre to tempt your avarice; my life too&#xD;
precious to be given up without a struggle !" rejoined the trav-&#xD;
eller, and with a single blow, he hurled his antagonist to the&#xD;
ground, and hurried on, murmuring:&#xD;
"Ali! I wonder if Marian Winthrop would weep if they had&#xD;
found me dead on the lonely moor !"&#xD;
He had heard wild stories of the outlaws that infested these&#xD;
mooj, and was not surprised when he received another chal-&#xD;
lenge of a similar nature. His second assailant followed him&#xD;
for a whole hour, ever and anon pausing for a hand-to-hand&#xD;
conflict, but at length he too was felled to the earth, and&#xD;
Laurence Verner resumed his journey.&#xD;
"I am late," he said' to himself, as he perceived the cross,&#xD;
and the ruined Oratory-" Heaven grant that Marian Winthrop&#xD;
may be waiting for me, for I have staked all my chances of&#xD;
happiness on this meeting."&#xD;
As he spoke, a voice that sent a strange thrill through every&#xD;
nerve, fell on his ear, and breathing in a tone scarcely above'a&#xD;
whisper the single word "Marian," he leaned forward in breath-&#xD;
less interest.  The girl had ceased her contention, and was&#xD;
walking at Mark Aylesford's side, While he talked with the as-&#xD;
surance of an accepted lover. Verner's first impulse was to&#xD;
break in u pon their tete-a-tete, and charge her with arrant&#xD;
coquetry, but he resisted the temptation, and stealthily with-&#xD;
drew. Mark Aylesford had left Marian in the porch, and his&#xD;
tall form was lost to sight in a grove of firs at some distance,&#xD;
when Verner appeared on the spot, where the girl still stood,&#xD;
so changed that she scarcely recogniized himi.&#xD;
"Aha !" he muttered, " I beg you to walk by the Holy-Well,&#xD;
and to mock me, you meet Mark Aylesford there, and hnld a&#xD;
lover's tryst with him! You have deluded mec into the belief&#xD;
that lhe was nothing to yot that you regarded him with posi-&#xD;

tive disgust, but I am no longer your dupe I The scales hate.&#xD;
fallen from my eyes, and I see you as you are-false, cold, cruel."&#xD;
"0, Laurence, Laurence," cried the girl, "do not reproatch&#xD;
me till you know the truth ! Listen to me, I implore you!"&#xD;
The young man hesitated an instant, but then his face grew&#xD;
more stormy, and he exclaimed:&#xD;
"No, no, it will be useless-you cannot explain! I have loved&#xD;
you as no man ever loved you before, or will love you again,&#xD;
notwithstanding the homage which follows you; flattered and&#xD;
courted as you are, I began to think you cared for me, and&#xD;
would yet return my love with equal depth and fervor. It was&#xD;
a wild, delirious dream, but I am awake now, thank God! I&#xD;
leave you to Mark Aylesford, and tie upbraidings of conscience,&#xD;
-which will sooner or later tell you how basely you have wronged&#xD;
me."l&#xD;
"Do not speak In that strain, Laurence-I do not deserve it?&#xD;
"False girl," rejoined the young man-"false in word, in&#xD;
tone, in look, and manner-you shall trifle with me no more.&#xD;
I am going away-not only from you, from Cornwall, but from&#xD;
England-I shall not rest till leagues of land and sea lie between&#xD;
us. Good night, Marian-it will be hard to teach myself to call&#xD;
you Marian Aylesford."&#xD;
"Stay, stay," wailed the poor girl-" do not let a slight mis-&#xD;
understanding part us forever!"&#xD;
"A slight mis understanding!" sneered Verner, and bounded&#xD;
from the porch.&#xD;
Marian Winthrop sprang down the steps, and followed him&#xD;
till a mist swam before her eyes, and she sank fainting in the&#xD;
narrow path she was threading.&#xD;
The day subsequent 'a pale, grave young man, with something&#xD;
in his face, that spoke of the shadow which had fallen on his&#xD;
life, came riding along the wild, Cornwall coast. At the pier&#xD;
of a small sea-port town, he leaped into a boat, and rowed out&#xD;
toward a vessel lying at anchor, but all astir on board.&#xD;
"Ho! there," 'cried one of the officers, as he espied the little&#xD;
craft and its occupant, " what news do you bring ?"&#xD;
" I shall sail with you-nothing nowv binds me to England."&#xD;
"lBravo!I" exclaimed the mate, and Laurence Verner sprang&#xD;
on deck.&#xD;
As the vesseI spread her white sails to the breeze, and went&#xD;
ploughing through the waters, a stormy scene was being enacted&#xD;
'at the old manse, which had for ;years been the home of Mariaa&#xD;

Winthrop. Up the long avenue leading to the house, a dark,&#xD;
saturnine man had dashed, mounted on a powerful black horse&#xD;
-it was Mark Aylesford. Squire Winthrop, who was drowsing&#xD;
over his newspaper in the pleasant porch where Marian had&#xD;
parted with her indignant lover, sprang to meet the guest with&#xD;
an eagerness, that told he was an especial favorite, and extending&#xD;
his hand, exclaimed:&#xD;
"Welcome, welcome, Aylesford "&#xD;
The guest made some careless reply, and then, with a search-&#xD;
ing glance, asked:&#xD;
"Pray, why is not Ifarian here to welcome her lover?2"&#xD;
"The girl is ill," responded the old gentleman.&#xD;
"Ah ! and what is the matter ?"&#xD;
"Indeed we don't hardly know; she seemed well enough till&#xD;
last night, and then one of the servants found her in a dead&#xD;
faint in the garden. He brought her in, and called me and the&#xD;
housekeeper, and we have done the best we could for her. To-&#xD;
day she cannot raise her head from the pillow, and yet she will&#xD;
not allow me to send for a physician."&#xD;
"And you cannot account for her sudden illness," resumed&#xD;
Aylesford.I&#xD;
"No, no, I am completely mystified; her nerves must have&#xD;
received a great shock, but I can elicit nothing from her."&#xD;
.Aylesford started, and his fierce blood glowed through his&#xD;
cheek, and flamed in his dark eyes.&#xD;
"I believe I can fathom the mystery," he rejoined-" though&#xD;
you are not aware of it, your daughter expected to meet Lau-&#xD;
rence Verner by the Sacred Well at ten o'clock last night.n"&#xD;
"Impossible-she would not dare disobey me thus."&#xD;
"It is, nevertheless as true as the gospel, Squire Winthrop.&#xD;
I got an inkling of the plan, and resolved to foil the young vil-&#xD;
lain. He wrote a note, which he concealed in a bouquet, and&#xD;
hired a shepherd lad to drop at Marian's feet. I met the boy&#xD;
on his way, and as I had the heaviest purse bribed him to my&#xD;
service. The plot worked to a charm-it was , instead of Lau--&#xD;
rence Verner, who walked with Marian at the- well of St. Clare,&#xD;
but she did not for a time attempt to conceal her disappoint-.'&#xD;
ment, acknowledging to my face, that she would vhstly have&#xD;
preferred a meeting with Laurence Verner."&#xD;
" By the powers, is the girl mad I" exclaimed the old squire,&#xD;
beating his gold-headed cane vigorously on the stone fiags of&#xD;
the perch-" if you had not told me, I would not have credited&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
,10&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
this story, Mark Aylesford. . Even now I can hardly believe it."&#xD;
"Her infatuation is as perplexing as it is-singular," observed&#xD;
the guest, "and though I succeeded in breaking up the tryst&#xD;
at the Holy Well, I fear they met afterward in your own&#xD;
grounds."&#xD;
"1I will go in and inquire of the servants," said is host, and&#xD;
while Aylesford restlessly promenaded the gravel walk where&#xD;
he had dismounted, Squire Winthrop hurried into the kitchen.&#xD;
The servants were one by one interrogated, but to no purpose,&#xD;
and the old squire stalked to the stables to find the coachman,&#xD;
who, returning late from an adjoining town, had found Marian&#xD;
and borne her into the house.&#xD;
"Tom," began his master, "circumstances have led me to.&#xD;
think your young mistress had a clandestine meeting with a-&#xD;
person whose attentions I have forbidden, and that in some way,,&#xD;
was the cause of her fainting."-&#xD;
He paused, but Tom was silent, and he went on:&#xD;
" If you saw anybody with Marian, or about the grounds,&#xD;
you know me too, well to attempt to trifle with me."&#xD;
The coachman hesitated a moment, but though the master&#xD;
could be most genial when in the mood, he was cold, harsh and&#xD;
exacting, if opposed, and therefore he reluctantly said:&#xD;
"It is hard to speak evil of my young mistress, sir, but I did&#xD;
see from the stable here, the gentleman who has of late been&#xD;
staying at the Grange with Hal Warland."&#xD;
" Verner-Laurence Verner," muttered the old man, and Tom&#xD;
nodded assent, adding:&#xD;
" Their meeting could not have been a pleasant one, sir, for&#xD;
when he darted through the grounds, he looked pale and stern,&#xD;
and she-you know how I found her lying half-dead on the&#xD;
grass as if she had no heart to live longer."&#xD;
"Enough," cried Squire Winthrop, and in a paroxysm of rage&#xD;
he strode back to his guest.&#xD;
Well," said Aylesford, "have you learned anything to&#xD;
confirm my suspicion? "&#xD;
" Yes,, there was a meeting," and he prcedtoepa&#xD;
Tom'setory." exclimed Aylesford, "he shall answer to me for&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE&#xD;
&#xD;
GRANGE-HAL WARLAND-MARK AYLESFORD'S VISIT-&#xD;
HEAVIER CLOUDS IN MARIAN WINTHROP'S SKY.&#xD;
&#xD;
WARLAND GRANGE was a fine specimen .of -an old English&#xD;
country-seat, and sufficiently picturesque to have been *trans-&#xD;
ferred to the sketch-book of any travelling artist. The house&#xD;
was built of Cornwall granite, with fantastic gables, dormer&#xD;
windows, sunk deep into the high, peaked roof, and tall, tower-&#xD;
like chimneys. The hedges looked like green ramparts; the&#xD;
trees grew in unpruned luxuriance; moss and ivy matted the&#xD;
walls, and the whole place wore an air of neglect, for years,&#xD;
before some sorrow had driven Mr. Warjand abroad,-and since&#xD;
then he had rarely visited his home. Three months previous to&#xD;
the date of our stoi'y, he had returned, bringing with him a&#xD;
young man, whose kinduess during-Warland's illness on the&#xD;
voyage, had awakened his deepest gratitude. Of Laurence&#xD;
Verner he knew nothing, save that he was an orphan, and fromn&#xD;
his childhood had fought a stern battle with the world, encoun-&#xD;
tering poverty, hardship and privation on every hand. Such&#xD;
was Laurence V-rner when, at a Mayday fete, he had met&#xD;
Marian Winthrop, the belle of the country. Was it a strange&#xD;
destiny, that made him seem the realization of the girl's ideal,&#xD;
and gave his look and tone a power, no other suitor had pos-&#xD;
y sessed ? Neither her father, nor Mark Aylesford, was able to&#xD;
be present, and his hand placed the crown on her brow, and&#xD;
during the long, bright hours of the day, she danced and chatted&#xD;
with him to her heart's content. Squire Winthrop had after-&#xD;
ward denounced him as a mere adventurer, and closed his doors&#xD;
upon him, but Marian could not dash aside the cup, foaming at&#xD;
her lips with its perilous sweetness. Again and again there&#xD;
had been chance meetings,.and their mutual interest had ripened&#xD;
ilto love-that love, which is either the blessing or the bane of&#xD;
our lives. Squire Winthrop's fortunes, like those of many .an&#xD;
.English house, were fast deeliBing, and the immense wealth of&#xD;

Niark Aylesford had rendered his suit acceptable to the avari-&#xD;
cious father, and gained from him what Marian had firmly&#xD;
withheld-the promise of her hand. It is true there were people,&#xD;
who declared that Aylesford was a man of lawless habits, but to&#xD;
these rumors the squire was deaf, or if he listened, he asserted&#xD;
that envy prompted the scandal.&#xD;
Mark Aflesford's manner boded no good, as he stalked along&#xD;
the grassy path, which wound from the high-road to Hal War-&#xD;
land's door, and gave a furious rap. The next moment, he was&#xD;
ushered into a dim library, where among his books, busts,&#xD;
pictures and medallions, sat a gentleman, somewhat past the&#xD;
prime of life.&#xD;
" Have I the honor of addressing Mr. Hamilton Warland 2"&#xD;
asked the intruder, with mock deference.&#xD;
Warland bowed, and he continued:&#xD;
"Well, sir, I am Mark Aylesford of Aylsford Park, and I&#xD;
have Come to ask a few questions."&#xD;
"Pray be seated,"'and Warland pointed to a chair.&#xD;
"No, thank you-my call will doubtless be brief, and I must&#xD;
at once proceed to business. Where is Mr. Verner-I must see&#xD;
him immediately; he has outraged me beyond endurance, and&#xD;
I will hold him responsible !"&#xD;
"Please explain yourself," said Mr. Warland, coolly.&#xD;
"By Jove, he-has stolen the heart of my lady-love, and le&#xD;
shall answer for it!"&#xD;
1"Do not get into a passion, sir-Mr. Verner has left the&#xD;
country."&#xD;
" Left the country !" cried Aylesford, and for a time he paced&#xD;
the floor in wild exultation; then he paused before Warland,&#xD;
and hissed:&#xD;
"After all, this may be a trick to cheat me out of my revenge,&#xD;
but if you have deluded me, the worst is your own I" And he&#xD;
shook his clenched hand in his companion's face.&#xD;
" Silence !" exclaimed Warland, springing from his chair withk&#xD;
a dignity that well nigh awed the bravado-" I do not fear you,&#xD;
but as a gentleman I think your insults beneath my notice !&#xD;
Leave me, and never again presume to set foot in my house."&#xD;
Muttering a curse, Mark Aylesford withdrew, and dashed off&#xD;
to the manse, where Squire Winthrop was awaiting-him.&#xD;
" Have you seen the young scapegrace-?" queried the old man,&#xD;
as Aylesford stopped once more by the rustic porch.&#xD;
" No, the coward has left England, ijf Warland's word is to be&#xD;

trusted. How is that, for I have no acquaintance with him, as&#xD;
I have come into the neighborhood since he bas been-abroad."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I think we can rely on him," rejoined the squire,&#xD;
"and I must conflss, I feel greatly relieved if he has gone,; it is&#xD;
sufficient proof that his love was hopeless; it also confirms my&#xD;
daughter's statement, for during your absence I questioned her,&#xD;
and she told me that they met last night, and parted forever."&#xD;
"She conftbssed they had a meeting then," observed Aylesford,&#xD;
with a lowering brow.&#xD;
"Yes, but since he has left the country, you have naught to&#xD;
fear."&#xD;
" By Heaven, he may return any day, and clandestinely snatch&#xD;
my prize from me. I cannot rest till she is mine, Squire&#xD;
Winthrop."&#xD;
"She shall be yours whenever you will it, &amp;amp;ylesford-fix the&#xD;
wedding-day, and she shall be ready-you have a Winthrop's&#xD;
promise "&#xD;
"Let it be a month hence-you see I am an Impatient lover."&#xD;
"Indeed, under the circumstances, I am not surprised at your&#xD;
eagerness."&#xD;
"I leave it to you to inform Marian of our decision; as her&#xD;
nerves are in such a state, I think I had better not seek'*an ini-&#xD;
terview to-day, but to-morrow you may expect me." -&#xD;
Thus they parted, and Hark Aylesford went careering away&#xD;
over hill and dale, with a thousand tumultuous thoughts rioting&#xD;
in his brain.&#xD;
"Confound it," he exclaimed, as he glanced at his watch,,&#xD;
"this mad .chase after a love-sick 'boy has swallowed up my&#xD;
time-I shall be late at the place where I was to keep my ap-&#xD;
pointment, and he will be furious and desperate! What a fate&#xD;
it is, to make friends and' allies of men you despise and fear !'"&#xD;
As he spoke, he urged his steed onward, and at length struck&#xD;
into a dense wood., He had gone but a short distance through&#xD;
the shadows, when he perceived the ruffian, who.had been the&#xD;
first to waylay Laurence Verner on the lonesome moor. It&#xD;
was' evident that he walked with extreme difficulty, and, one&#xD;
arm was in a sling. .&#xD;
" Hand over the gold," he cried, in a surly tone,.&#xD;
" The gold was not earned," retorted Aylesford. " Laurence&#xD;
Verner was in Squire Winthrop's garden before midnight."&#xD;
" You only bade us detain him so thait lie could not reach the&#xD;
well of St. Clare at the hour he~ was expected, and we have kept&#xD;
&#xD;
114&#xD;
&#xD;
our part of the contract-keep 'yours, or there will. be trouble&#xD;
in the camp."&#xD;
"You have nothing to do with it-Gates is the man I came&#xD;
to meet-where is he ?"&#xD;
"Not in these woods."&#xD;
"Where then ?" queried Aylesford, in evident alarm.&#xD;
"He is playing the gentleman, and has gone down to Ayles-&#xD;
ford Park."&#xD;
A volley of oaths answered the highwayman, and wheeling&#xD;
his horse, he rode to his own stately home. It was evening&#xD;
when he reached his estate, and as he galloped through the&#xD;
park, deer wen-t bounding through the green vistas, statues&#xD;
gleamed like beautiful petrifactions amid the dusk, and foun-&#xD;
tains and cascades flung up a silvery spray. On entering the&#xD;
hall of the grand mansion, which owned him as its master, he&#xD;
found himself in a flood of rich light, shed. by the glittering&#xD;
chandelier, and as he moved from room to room, his feet sank&#xD;
deep in gorgeous carpets, while rare drapings, tables, mirrors,&#xD;
lounges, lamps and vases were scattered about in tasteful pro-&#xD;
fusion. At the door of' his chamber he met his confidential&#xD;
servant, who whispered:.&#xD;
"Sir, you've a guest waiting for you within.&#xD;
"Gates, is it not ?"&#xD;
"Yes, did you expect to find him here?"&#xD;
" Not till a comrade told me he had come-do you think. any&#xD;
of the servants saw, or suspected him or his errand ?"&#xD;
"No, my good. master, you need not fear-i spied- him at a&#xD;
little distance, and managed to smuggle him into the house&#xD;
unobserved."&#xD;
"Bravo." And Aylesford thrust two or three, gold coins into&#xD;
Robert's hand, and stole into the room where Philip Gates sat,&#xD;
sullen and wrathful.&#xD;
"Mark Aylesford," he cried, " you are worse than a fool to&#xD;
make an enemy of me I Balch and I well nigh lost our lives' in&#xD;
that encounter on the moor, and yet the gold is not forth-&#xD;
coming.,&#xD;
Aylesford replied as he had in the forest, but the outlaw de-&#xD;
clared that they had kept Laurenee Verner on the moor beyond&#xD;
the time specified, and required the fulfilment of the contract.&#xD;
He sa~w that he was in the highwayman''s power, and was&#xD;
' obliged',to count out the promised stum, and seal his lips with&#xD;
another bribe. Aylesford breathed more freely when -the des-&#xD;

perado was lost to sight amid the shadows, and he paused, in&#xD;

" Henceforth I shall not need their aid to carry on my suit&#xD;

Soliloquizing thus, he closed the door, and sauntered in to his&#xD;
late dinner. When he had gone, a woman muffled in a loose,&#xD;
foreign cloak of black cloth, and with a face which still retained&#xD;
traces of rare beauty, in spite of the haggard cheek, dishevelled&#xD;
hair, and dark, mournful eyes, rose from her hiding-place hard&#xD;
by the massive steps, on which Aylesford had' been standing.&#xD;
It would be impossible to describe the expression of her coun-&#xD;
tenance, or give an idea of the agony which wailed out in the&#xD;
cry:&#xD;
"0, my God! it is all true then ! Marian Winthrop Is to be&#xD;
his wife, unless I can prevent the marriage."&#xD;
For a few moments she stood reflecting, the storm Within&#xD;
painting itself on every feature. At length she said:&#xD;
"I will go-there can be no harm in speaking a word to her,&#xD;
at least-whether she heed me or not, I must warn her !"&#xD;
Darting through the grounds, as if her purpose had lent her&#xD;
wings, she hastened toward the manse. The night "was far on&#xD;
her pathway of stars," when she gained the quaint, many-gabled&#xD;
old house, tenanted by the Winthrops. How steadfast were&#xD;
the stars, looking out at her from the tranquil blue of the sum-&#xD;
mer sky-how like the face of a young vestal, the moon shone&#xD;
above the rugged heights of Cornwall, how softly the flowers&#xD;
rocked in the south wind, how fair was the landscape, stretch-&#xD;
ing as far as her eye could sweep! What a blessed quiet seemed&#xD;
to brood everywhere, save in her own heart! Her step was un-&#xD;
steady as she crossed the dewy garden, and moved along the&#xD;
terrace beneath the window through which she had seen a light&#xD;
glimmering. As she paused, she saw a face pressed hard&#xD;
against the pane, and then a pair of restless hands flung up the&#xD;
casement, and a young girl leaned forth to cool her fevered&#xD;
brow.&#xD;
"Are you Marian Winthrop 2" inquired the strange woman.&#xD;
" Yes, madam, do you want a night's shelter ?"&#xD;
" No, no-there can be no rest for me in the wide world, but,&#xD;
but I have mueli to say to you."&#xD;
" Come in-the balcony steps lead to my chamber. Perhaps&#xD;
I am rash to admit you, but something in your face gives me a'&#xD;
painful interest In you."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WELL OF ST. CLARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
In another Instant the woman stood before her, and grasping&#xD;
her arm, exclaimed:&#xD;
"I have heard that you are engaged to Mark Aylesford-is4 it&#xD;
true, or merely gossip ?"&#xD;
Ma ian bowed, for she could not find voice to speak, and the&#xD;
stranger went on.&#xD;
"Do you love him?"&#xD;
"Love him? No, no-I hate Mark Aylesford! The match&#xD;
is my father's, not mine, and if they force me to marry him, it&#xD;
will break my heart."&#xD;
"And what renders him your father's favorite ?"&#xD;
His wealth, madam-his grand mansion, his carriages, his&#xD;
horses, his Cornwall mines-these are weighed in the balance&#xD;
against my own happiness."&#xD;
"Poor girl, poor girl!" And the woman's fingers wandered&#xD;
softly over Marian's gold-brown hair, while her tears fell thick&#xD;
and fast---"if it is in my power," she added, "I will save you&#xD;
from a marriage which would be a living death. Mark Ayles-&#xD;
ford is unworthy of you," and she proceeded to make a startling&#xD;
disclosure. "And now," she said, "promise me one thing,&#xD;
Marian Winthrop."&#xD;
"And what is it ?"&#xD;
"That you will appear to accede to your father's wishes, and&#xD;
keep what I have revealed a secret, till I unseal your lips."&#xD;
"I promise," replied Marian, and they separated.&#xD;
When the stranger had gained the garden below, she stopped,&#xD;
and looked back at the house through a mist of warm tears.&#xD;
" She shall not be sacrificed," she muttered, "if I can save her&#xD;
from such a doom. What would Mark Aylesford say if his wife&#xD;
should be snatched from him at the very altar, and Laurence&#xD;
Verner win the prize? God knows I am not seeking to avenge&#xD;
my wrongs, but to rescue a pure young girl from a marriage she&#xD;
declares would break her heart."&#xD;

PLACES#&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAN-&#xD;
&#xD;
- WHNT Mark Aylesford v*iited the Winthrops the day subse-&#xD;
- quent to the stormy scenes at the Grange, and with the indignant&#xD;
outlaws, he was surprised at the change in Marian. . She was&#xD;
still pale, her smile faint, and her step languid, but she did not&#xD;
treat him with-scorn, pr positive coldness.&#xD;
"Mark,' she said, as they sat together in the old-fashioned&#xD;
parlor, "Laurence Verner and I have had a quarrel, and as he&#xD;
declares, parted forever. I shall. no longer oppose my - father's&#xD;
wishes."&#xD;
Bravo, bravo! that is all we - could ask now," exclaimed&#xD;
Aylesford; "and as for me, I am not without hope that you may&#xD;
yet be the happiest as you now are the loveliest. woman in&#xD;
Cornwall."&#xD;
The squire hastened to offer his congratulations and in&#xD;
bumpers ofthe best Bordeaux drank to the future Mrs. Aylesford.&#xD;
Marian gradually rallied from  the shock her system had&#xD;
received, and began to manifest a womanly interest in the festal&#xD;
preparations, and the trousseau, which was- to be the envy of&#xD;
the village girls.&#xD;
One day she sat bending over a. piece of fine needlework,&#xD;
when there was a tap at her door, and the housekeeper bustled&#xD;
in, exclaiming:                      -           .&#xD;
" Both your father and I think we need two or three more&#xD;
servants till after the wedding, and Tom, the coachman, has&#xD;
sent a seamstress--a nice, quiet sort of person she seems, but of&#xD;
course you must decide thienatter, Miss Marian."&#xD;
"Show her in," replied the girl, and the next instant the&#xD;
stranger stood in her presence. Though the luxuriant dark hair&#xD;
was concealed by a widow's cap, and the lustre of the brilliant&#xD;
eyes covered by a pair of spectacles, and various other disguises&#xD;
employed, Marian recognized the face of her who had made&#xD;
such startling revelations with regard to Mark Aylesford. Her&#xD;
&#xD;
heart gave a wild bound, but, save the quick, significant glance&#xD;
that passed between them, there was no other 'token of recog -&#xD;
nition.&#xD;
"The housekeeper tells me," observed Marian, "that you&#xD;
have come to apply for the situation of , eamstress."&#xD;
"Yes; and you, I presume, are Miss Winthrop."&#xD;
Marian nodded, and the woman went on:&#xD;
"Perhaps. you would like to look at my references."&#xD;
"No, it does not matter; your needlework is the best recom-&#xD;
mendation. I can soon judge \ whether you will suit me, and&#xD;
if you do not, I shall dismiss you."&#xD;
Marian then stated the price she would pay, and guided the&#xD;
new seamstre -s into the sewing-room, which was in the rear of&#xD;
the house, and commanded a view of the kitchen garden, with&#xD;
its thrifty fruit-trees, 'and beds of vegetables, and the green&#xD;
paddocks and dim copses beyond.. A great horse-chestnut&#xD;
shaded the windows, and wood ine crept over the antique&#xD;
lattice. As. Marian pointed to the wedding dress, which was&#xD;
not yet finished, a sudden faintness drove the blood from the&#xD;
stranger's cheek, and she drew her 'breath gaspingly, at the&#xD;
memories it evoked. She -staggered to a seat near the window,&#xD;
and mechanically commenced her task, bat as she proceeded,&#xD;
hot tears fell bn the thick moire, and her fingers trembled&#xD;
nervously amid its folds.&#xD;
After giving a few directions, the bride-elect glided from the&#xD;
room, and the new seamstress.was left to -her own thoughts.&#xD;
tHer work being satisfactory, she was told that she could remain&#xD;
till after the wedding, at least, and she and Marian played their&#xD;
.part so well that nobody suspected the ruse which had been&#xD;
practised. The servants, from the housekeeper to the scullion,&#xD;
were loud in her praise, and even the squire declared her-quite&#xD;
an acquisition. Mark Aylesford was of course a frequent&#xD;
visitor, and God alone knows what she suffered when she heard&#xD;
his step, his voice, his boisterous laugh, ringing up from the&#xD;
dining-hall, and saw the splendid gifts he had- purchased for his&#xD;
young bride. The first time he visited Marian after her engage-&#xD;
mnent, at the manse, his tone3s floated to her ear from the terrace&#xD;
where he -had chanced to meet the girl, and she saw him bend&#xD;
low, apad lift that little hand to his lips. 'Involuntarily she gasped&#xD;
the word " MARK ;" but her articulation was - too faint to be&#xD;
heard by her companions in the work-i-oom, and she soon gained&#xD;
sufficient self-ontrol to preserve her secret. A terrible anguish&#xD;

THE WELL OF ST. CLARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
was gnawing at her heart; the spell of the past was strong upon&#xD;
her, but she dared not moan, dared not shriek out her agony.,&#xD;
lIt was on the third week of her stay with the Winthrops, that&#xD;
she stood by Marian's dressing-table, examining a set of dia-&#xD;
monds, which Mark Aylesford had just sent by his liveried foot-&#xD;
man. The lamp-light shone over them till they were all a-blaze,&#xD;
but both Marian and the woman known as Mrs. Holt were&#xD;
frightfully pale as they gazed. They had been left for a moment&#xD;
alone, and clasping her hands, the girl wailed:&#xD;
"0, when, when will this farce end? .&#xD;
"Wait and hope," rejoined the woman. "Be-patient, for my&#xD;
plans are working better than I could have expected. In God's&#xD;
own good time, you shall be released."&#xD;
They were now interrupted, but the girl's smile told how 'she&#xD;
had been cheered by the stranger's assurance.&#xD;
And Mark Aylesford-what of him? Though he was appa-&#xD;
rently the happiest of lovers, he had been persecuted by Gates&#xD;
and his ruffianly crew, and besides, a new fear had dawned&#xD;
upon him. On returning home from a visit to the manse, his&#xD;
confidential servant had followed him into his chamber, and&#xD;
muttered:&#xD;
"I have evil tidings, for you, my waster."&#xD;
"What can it be? Has Gates renewed his demands, or&#xD;
Laurence Verner come stealing into Cornwaill ?"&#xD;
"Neither, sir."&#xD;
"Confound you, Robert, speak out-I never could bear&#xD;
suspense."l&#xD;
"I verily believe Ginevra is in the neighborhood."&#xD;
"Nonsense-I will not credit the story-I tell you she is&#xD;
leagues and leagues away."&#xD;
Robert 'shookhis head, exclaiming:&#xD;
"I am not deceived. - Ginevra, or her ghost, has haunted&#xD;
Aylesford Park of late. I have seen a woman litting about like-&#xD;
a shadow-a woman with a foreign air and costume, and do&#xD;
you think I could mistake Ginevra ?"&#xD;
Aylesford reflected a few moments, and then said:&#xD;
" By Heaven, if she is here, she must be plotting some mis-&#xD;
chief-women always are, when they cannot have everything'to&#xD;
suit their own purposes; but in less than a week Marian will be&#xD;
my wife, and I can laugh at fate."&#xD;
The bridal evening at length came, and before the mirror in&#xD;
Marian's dressing-chamnber, a lady stood making her toilet.&#xD;
&#xD;
T    ELL OF ST. CLARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
121&#xD;
&#xD;
The bridesmaids had not yet arrived, and with her own hands&#xD;
she put on the thick moire robe, trailing about her like frosted&#xD;
silver, the vapory veil, the delicate gloves, and the   ad&#xD;
parure. A sharp cry sounded through the room, as the lady&#xD;
gazed at the reflection in the toilet-glass, and with a hurried&#xD;
step she paced the carpet. Suddenly there was atap at the&#xD;
door, and Mark Aylesford's voice asked:&#xD;
"Are you ready, Marian ?"&#xD;
"Quite ready," was the low reply, and the lady enclosed the&#xD;
door.. The next moment she had drawn back her veil, revealing&#xD;
a pale face, which still Wore a solemn beauty.ca&#xD;
"Ginevra I"-faltered Aylesford, while his chest heaved, and&#xD;
the flush died away from his cheek.&#xD;
For a time there was a deep silence, and then he exclaimed:&#xD;
"Woman, what cursed game have you been playing on me&#xD;
"Mark," responded the lady,1"do not act thebravado.&#xD;
have not come to revenge myself on you for my wrongs, but to&#xD;
save you from sin, and Marian Winthrop from a fate that would&#xD;
have been worse than death."&#xD;
At that instant Squire Winthrop, clad in his holiday suit, and&#xD;
wittha white favor in his buttonhole, made his appearance on&#xD;
the threshold.&#xD;
"Marian," he began,"the bridesmaids have come.1"&#xD;
"It can be of no use, sir," said the woman, firmly.  tam&#xD;
Mark Aylesford's wife, and no wedding can take place to-night.&#xD;
These papers contain the proofs of my statement ;" and she&#xD;
produced a certificate, which the old man read in silent dismay.&#xD;
"From the certificate you will see," resumed the stranger, ithat&#xD;
on the twelfth of May, 1859, Marcus Aylesford and Ginevra&#xD;
Borghese were married, by the Rev. Father Raphael Lenotti, in&#xD;
distant Rome. I am the daughter of a noble house, ind it was&#xD;
an evil hour for me, when, with my old father's curse ringing in&#xD;
MY ears, became thewife of the young Englishman, who hd&#xD;

native land, and then I resolved. to follow him. On reaching'&#xD;
Cornwall, the casual gossip of the foungers at the village inn&#xD;
revealed the fact that he was betrothed to a young English girl,&#xD;
and I have exerted every effort to prevent such a sin on his%&#xD;
part, and such a sacriflee on hers, as would l'e this marriage.&#xD;
Disguised as a seamstress, I gained employment in your family,&#xD;
and won the friendship of your daughter. Mrs.' Holt and&#xD;
Ginevra Aylesford are one. Marian told me you coveted his&#xD;
houses, his lands, his extensive Cornwall mines, but you will&#xD;
bless the day when I rescued your pure and beautiful child from&#xD;
an alliance with a man, Who has gained his riches by contraband&#xD;
traffic, and is really the employer and associate of the outlaws&#xD;
of the Cornish moors !"&#xD;
"Ye gods!" muttered the old man, advancing to Mark&#xD;
Aylesford, "your face confirms the stranger's statement-guilt&#xD;
Is written on every feature, and I scorn you !" Here, Tom,&#xD;
John," he shouted to the servants, "put this man out of the.&#xD;
house!"&#xD;
" Ay, ay," responded the lackeys, and as Tom crossed the&#xD;
threshold, he exclaimed:  '&#xD;
"I am glad the villain is unmasked, my dear master. Of late&#xD;
I have interested myself a good deal in Miss Marian's fate, and&#xD;
I knew him to. be hand-and-glove with the robbers of the moor.&#xD;
I have been eaves-dropping when he has met them in the forest,&#xD;
and in Aylesford Park. I helped the deserted wife to her place&#xD;
in your household, and travelled with my young lady to the&#xD;
place where ,she met the stage-coach. Her headach&amp;amp; was&#xD;
feigned, sir-At was only a stratagem to get off before ,our plot&#xD;
should be found.out."&#xD;
Mark Aylesford was writhing with passion, but had' his' life&#xD;
depended on it, he could not have uttered a- word. Tom and&#xD;
his fellowservant thrust him down the steps, and Robert, his,&#xD;
right hand man, lifted him, when le sank in a strange paralysis&#xD;
to the ground. Hard by stood the splendid equipage, in which&#xD;
he expected to bear home his fair bride-the blood horses arch-&#xD;
ing their glossy necks, and pawing the earth with a spirit that&#xD;
showed their mettle. Robert placed his master within, anid&#xD;
closing the door upon him, ordered the coachman to drive with&#xD;
the utmost speed to Aylesford Park. '&#xD;
When he had gone, Squire Winthrop turned to Ginevra, and.&#xD;
offered his acknowledgments for her agency in revealing Mark&#xD;
Aylesford's real characters.            ,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WELL OF ST. CLARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And'now," he continued, where is Marian? I must confess&#xD;
my fault, and beg her pardon. I would rather beg my bread&#xD;
from door to door, than see her the wife of Aylesford."&#xD;
"She started, iny dear sir, for the continent; a friend of hers&#xD;
was to sail from your own Cornwall coast on a wedding tour,&#xD;
and I have borne messages to and fro, arranging the matter&#xD;
between the two young ladies. Bertha Ruthven is the only&#xD;
child, of a rich man, and she can afford to be generous and:&#xD;
defray the expenses of Marian's voyage across the channel."&#xD;
"Across the channel 1" echoed the old man-" when was the&#xD;
vessel to sail ?"&#xD;
"Early teo-day, sir."&#xD;
"And where from?"&#xD;
" The little fishing village-of Wareham, whence many of Mr.&#xD;
Ruthven's vessels sail."&#xD;
" She must not go," cried Squire Winthrop. "Old as I am,&#xD;
I will mount my horse and gallop to Wareham. Perhaps some-&#xD;
thing may have occurred to delay them, and I shall find them&#xD;
there.&#xD;
A half-hour later, Squire Winthrop mounted his iron-gray&#xD;
horse, and rode off at a brisk pace, attended by Tom and a&#xD;
sturdy groom. All night the trio galloped on without stopping,&#xD;
and at dawn gained the little village of which .Ginevra had&#xD;
spoken. .A soft inist was rolling up from the hill dotted-with&#xD;
low cottages, a red light flushed the waters, and fishers' boats lay&#xD;
rocking with the tide. The old man drew rein beside the first.&#xD;
group he encountered on a rude pier, and said:&#xD;
"I wish to'inquire about the 'Elsinore,' which is to sail&#xD;
from your port, I am told."&#xD;
"She has gone, sir; a stiff breeze sprang up at noon, and she&#xD;
must bemany a league from here now."&#xD;
An expression of keen disappointment settled on, the old&#xD;
man's face, and silent and thoughtful, he took his way back to&#xD;
the manse.&#xD;
Leaving him to regret his. blindness and folly, we will follow&#xD;

ford, she stood on the deck, of the "Elsinore," watching the&#xD;
sunset glow which still lingered on the waves, and the fast-&#xD;
receding shores of rugged Cornwall. In due time they reached&#xD;
Havre, and then commenced in good earnest their continental&#xD;
- wanderings. Marian's heart was full of Laurence Verner, but&#xD;
where, where was he? Such was her query, as she traversed&#xD;
the busy streets of Paris, visited the German baths, and loitered&#xD;
by fountains and in grottoes, temples and galleries, famed in&#xD;
romance and in song. Finally they reached Venice, the Queen&#xD;
of the Adriatic-,-that fair city of the sea, with her storild palaces&#xD;
and prisons, her deep lagunes, her fanciful gondolas, and&#xD;
romantic gondoliers. Our party stood one day, leaning over&#xD;
the parapet of the Bridge of Sighs, of which Byron sung, when.&#xD;
like our tourists, he was a wanderer. Suddenly a familiar voice&#xD;
struck Marian's ear, and glancing round with an involuntary&#xD;
movement, she saw Laurence Verner. Her brain whirled, but&#xD;
through all her agitation,she was perfectly conscious of what&#xD;
was passing.&#xD;
. An unexpected meeting," he observed, coolly. "I presume&#xD;
you are on your wedding jaunt, Mrs. Aylesford."&#xD;
The next instant Marian had sunk fainting to the ground,&#xD;
but as her friends raised her, Mr. Ruthven replied.:&#xD;
"No MArs. Aylesford belongs to our party, sir; that match&#xD;
was broken up. My wife and Miss Winthroj have long been&#xD;
friends, and she fled with us to avoid a marriage which would&#xD;
have been a living death to her."&#xD;
Verner's features worked convulsively, and grasping Ruth-&#xD;
ven's hand, he faltered:&#xD;
" Then I must have been misled; such was my love for that&#xD;
girl, that I would- have. laid down my life for her sake, but I&#xD;
thought her cold and false, when I parted from her in Cornwall."&#xD;
"Ah, sir, I suspect you are Laurence Verner."&#xD;
"Yes, yes-perhaps you have heard her speak.of me."&#xD;
"Indeed I have, sir, and I-know one thing-she loves you&#xD;
with all her heart."&#xD;
"Give her to me," said the young man, " and let me go home&#xD;
with  you."      .-                              -&#xD;
" Certainly, certainly." And resigning his burden, Ruthven&#xD;
motioned 1o.a goindolier.&#xD;
With reverent, tenderness, Verner bore his now precious&#xD;
charge to the gondola, and they drifted on till the y-gained a&#xD;
flight of marble steps leading to the old palace, where the Ruth-&#xD;
&#xD;
vens had taken lodgings. There the gondolier stopped, and-&#xD;
Laurence Verner moved along the tesselated floor to a spacious&#xD;
saloon, contrasting vividly with the low, wainscotted rooms of&#xD;
her home in Cornwall.&#xD;
Wi4gh instinctive delicacy, Mr. and Mrs. Ruthven withdrew,&#xD;
and the re-united lovers were left alone.. It was not long ere&#xD;
Marian manifested tokens of returned consciousness, and as her&#xD;
eyes unclosed, they fell on the penitent face of Laurence&#xD;
Verner.&#xD;
"Marian, Marian," he murmured, "at last, at last I see you&#xD;
once more. While you have been senseless, your friends have&#xD;
told me sufficient to convince me that I misjudged you, when&#xD;
we parted, as I thought, forever."&#xD;
"Yes, Laurence-I received a note, which, as God hears me,&#xD;
I supposed to be from you, begging me to walk that night by&#xD;
the brink of the Holy Well. I went there, fully expecting to&#xD;
meet you, but instead I encountered Mark Aylesford. I told&#xD;
him frankly of my -disappointment, but his- rage filled me with&#xD;
forebodings on- your account, and I feared to provoke him&#xD;
further. I walked home with him in no enviable mood, and&#xD;
when I would have explained to you, Laurence, you taunted&#xD;
me, with fickleness, and froze my blood with your scorn. I&#xD;
fainted in the grounds, and was very ill the next day, arousing&#xD;
Aylesford's suspicion that there'had been a meeting between&#xD;
us, and my secret was -betrayed. He insisted on an immediate&#xD;
marriage, and I was looking hopelessly into the future, when a&#xD;
stranger came to my rescue;" and she proceeded to relate the&#xD;
story of Ginevra. Laurence Verner listened intently till she&#xD;
had concluded, and then sank at her feet, murmuring:&#xD;
"I dare not ask you to forgive me--my rashness has well nigh&#xD;
wrecked my life, and your own."&#xD;
"0 , Laurence, this meeting repays mie for all I have suffered&#xD;
-no shadow of blame falls upon you, when I look back into&#xD;
these eventful six months since I have known you."&#xD;
" Dear, dear Marian, I cannot thank you as I ought, but the&#xD;
future shall show you how grateful I am. I will try and prove&#xD;
/ more worthy of your love and confidence than Mark Aylesford.&#xD;
It is true I am a poor man, and from my, boyhood have been a&#xD;
waif in the world, tossed about by a fickle fortune, but with you&#xD;
for my good angel, I feel that I can do wonders. Some of my&#xD;
recent paintings have been admired an d purchased by lovers of&#xD;
art, and now I shall have a fresh inspiration. With Heaven's&#xD;

smile,, the sailor boy shall yet be an- artist of whom yon will be&#xD;
proud.",&#xD;
Marian's smiles, tears and blushes answered him, and late that&#xD;
night, they walked where the waves of the Adriatic murmured&#xD;
softly as- a wind harp, with love once more weaving its bright&#xD;
halo around their hearts-&#xD;
The next steamer brought a letter, which contained Squire&#xD;
Winthrop's confession, and an urgent request for Marian to&#xD;
return. The girl wrote a long and affectionate reply, and one&#xD;
passage was as follows:&#xD;
"I have found old friends in new places, and hope again stirs&#xD;
witin me. Laurence and I are reconciled, and we only need&#xD;
your sanction to our betrothal, to make our happiness complete."&#xD;
As soon as possible, Squire Winthrop despatched this brief,&#xD;
but characteristic answer:&#xD;
"I shall no longer attempt to stand between you and Lau-&#xD;
rence Verner, and hope to see you both at no distant day, in&#xD;
&#xD;
the old manse."&#xD;
&#xD;
Such was the state of- affairs, when Verner -hurried into&#xD;
Marian's presence, with a sheet, of closely-written paper in his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"I have the strangest news for you," he said, pausing at her&#xD;
side, and looking down into her beautiful face-"Dearest Marian-&#xD;
you are not to marry a mere nobody, after all."&#xD;
"What do you mean, Laurence? Some sudden hallucination&#xD;
must have seized you, for, believe me, I never thought you. a&#xD;
nobody."&#xD;
"1I am perfectly serious; what will you say when I tell you&#xD;
that this letter is from Hamilton Warland, and informs me I&#xD;
am his nearest survivingikinsman-the son of a brother, who,&#xD;
having wasted his strength to amass wealth in a foreign- clime,&#xD;
is dying of consumption at the Grange T&#xD;
"Indeed, I know not what to think," rejoined Marian, and&#xD;
her lover went on:-&#xD;
"I must go back to England at once, and meet my long-lost&#xD;
father, if possible, before he dies."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Laurence ;" and preparations were immediately&#xD;
made for the homeward voyage.&#xD;
It was in the golden-robed autumn, that they again took their&#xD;
way through the familiar scenes of Cornwall, and stopped at the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WELIiOF ST. CLARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Grange. The young man's uncle conducted him Into the room&#xD;
occupied by hi brother, and sinking by the be,sid, Iaurence&#xD;
niurmured:&#xD;
"1My dear father."&#xD;
"Thank God, you have -come ! for It would soon have -been&#xD;
too*late. I am failing fast, my boy."&#xD;
"And how does it happen that we have never met for twenty&#xD;
years ?"&#xD;
"I have been subject to the vicissitudes of a foreign land,&#xD;
and for five years an inmate of a Chinese prison; but I have&#xD;
improved my time since I was released, and you will be rich&#xD;
when I am gone, Laurence. They tell me you have had i hard&#xD;
struggle with the world, and been deprived of home, friends,&#xD;
and your rightful name since I left you with your old nurse, at&#xD;
the age of four, in a remote Welsh town."&#xD;
"0, sir, I shall value wealth only as it will minister to the&#xD;
comfort of my betrothed bride, whd is with ine. Marian, &amp;amp;ome&#xD;
hither; I am glad you can meet my father before he dies."&#xD;
The dying man looked yearningly ,into- her face, seized&#xD;
Marian's hand with a convulsive grasp, and placed it in his son's;&#xD;
the next moment he was dead.&#xD;
After sark Aylesford had recovered from the sudden illness&#xD;
that had fastened on him at finding himself thus exposed, lh&#xD;
set~ out for the continent, vowing that Marian should never&#xD;
marry Laupnce Verner; but his crew were smitten. with the&#xD;
small-pox, and the' ship became a floating pest-house. On&#xD;
reaching Marseilles, he was obliged to remain. quarantinee,&#xD;
and while he lay; scorched with fever, and writhing with pain,&#xD;
a woman ventured into the infected calUn. It was Ginevral&#xD;
Her patient devotion awoke all that was generous in his nature,,&#xD;
and from the hour of his recovery, lie abandonedd his, lawless&#xD;
habits, and devoted himself to.his wife.&#xD;
When the year of mourning for Hugh Warland had expired,&#xD;
Laurence took Marianto be the light of his home, the joy of&#xD;
his heart, and now their childrenplay amid- the 'moss-grown&#xD;
stones around the Well of St. Clare. .&#xD;
