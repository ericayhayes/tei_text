the balance from the debit to the credit side of all accounts, or&#xD;
vice versa. The millionaire finds himself a bankrupt ; the pau-&#xD;
per enters into possession of inexhaustible riches. The parched&#xD;
and fever-worn ascetic puts forth his hand to gather the delicious&#xD;
fruit of the tree of Life; the epicure begins to fry in Tartar els&#xD;
The humble man is exalted on a throne among admiring angels;&#xD;
the proud is trampled under the torturing feet of sneering de-&#xD;
mons.' Truly Death is a moralizer.&#xD;
I might say many other things in praise of Death, but I feel&#xD;
that it is vain to try to flatter the King of Terrors, so I confine&#xD;
myself to this one point, that He has always been a moral&#xD;
prince, nay, the prince of moralists. All the beautyolu e,&#xD;
of art, even of worship, becomes immoral and voluptuous,&#xD;
worldly and sensual, till his royal seal is put upon it. The glory&#xD;
of youth, the pomp of summer, the splendor of architecture,&#xD;
tend to idolatry, till age and winter and ivy-clad ruin correct&#xD;
and moralize them. What were even the sweetness of eccle-&#xD;
siastical hymns, and the marvellous masses of great composers,&#xD;
unless there were also dirges and requiems? The black vest-&#xD;
ments which the priest wears in offering theuoly Sacrifice for&#xD;
the dead, moralize the white and crimson sumptuousness of the&#xD;
festivals. Otherwise, the centre of all worship itself would lack&#xD;
the salutary symbol of man's mortality. Amid the throng of&#xD;
fashion that moves along the streets of the gay city are seen&#xD;
figures that announce the end of all things--the weeds of the&#xD;
mourners ! Interspersed with the glittering shoas are windows&#xD;
that preach a moral, those of the mourning warehouses; an&#xD;
when you turn from them with a secret shudder, your eye shall&#xD;
light upon the undertaker's painted coffin. That flashing line&#xD;
of equipages also shall not want its preacher-the black-plumed&#xD;
hearse. Let us turn the corner to avoid the unwelcome sight.&#xD;
Behold, we have happened upon a marble-factory, sepulchral&#xD;
urns and obelisks flanking its entrance, and slabs for tombstones,&#xD;
with "Sacred to the Memory" already chiselled. Let its quit&#xD;
this city where the skeleton grin thus intrudes at every turn; let&#xD;

and embowered in gardens :--haste to yonder enchanting grove&#xD;

&#xD;
INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.                  7&#xD;
monuments twinkle among the foliage :--everywhere, everywhere,&#xD;
the same thanatopsis,&#xD;
A profound philosophical reason exists for this ethical, and&#xD;
more than ethical, effect of the grave. Death is the natural&#xD;
law. All that is merely natural, then, must die? No: for the&#xD;
soul is natural. All that is physical, then? Even so: the G&#xD;
of Life, in imparting life freely to matter, has bestowed it with&#xD;
a universal limit as to its duration. Either, then, man is not all&#xD;
physical, or he is wholly mortal. If not wholly physical, and&#xD;
as to his immaterial part immortal, then the interests of his&#xD;
body and of time are subordinate to those of the soul  d f&#xD;
eternity. Then neither beauty, nor health, nor riches, nor fame&#xD;
nor pleasure, nor power, nor all these, with length of days, r&#xD;
high in the scale of good. When the triumphsof this agein&#xD;
material civilization are quoted, what could resist the argument&#xD;
against old religions and the nations yet faithful to the Cross,&#xD;
except the fact of death? What boots it to the boosters that&#xD;
their civilization triuttiphs, when they lie in cold obstruction?&#xD;
Stipendia peccati mors.  Death is a punishment.  One con-&#xD;
ceives that, when the criminal swings lightly from the gallows-&#xD;
tree. But surely for all it is a humiliation to die. Should not&#xD;
this great immortal spirit, this spark of the divinity, that flames&#xD;
within us, redeem its physical tabernacle from the law of nature?&#xD;
Alone in creation man is not simply the handiwork, but, by a&#xD;
divine likeness, the offspring of the invisible God. How then&#xD;
if he stood in his integrity, should man be suffered to die? Ah!&#xD;
- Death is more than a moralist--he is a theologian also.&#xD;
slaying infant innocence he demonstrates original sin. In quo&#xD;
omnes peccaverunt--so that there is no innocence. Hence the&#xD;
necessity of an expiatory death, necessity which Cain denied&#xD;
and Abel confessed; denial and confession alike reiterated&#xD;
'through all the ages, and sealed in all by the blood of the con-&#xD;
fessors. When I read some of our modn Ca        eo&#xD;
full of the idolatry of the present, and which habitually re&#xD;
the religion of atonement and sacrifice as at best a respectable&#xD;
myth, I think that"one of their columns at least contains&#xD;
standing refutation of their system: it is tel contahe&#xD;
Obituary. Didn't I tell you that Death was a preacher that holds&#xD;

A horse-block would serve him for a pulpit ; no place too pro-.&#xD;
fane for his homily. not even the pages of the - : he won't&#xD;
scruple to set his fleshless foot on a table covered with linen&#xD;
damask, or shining with polished oak, for a ghastly after-dinner&#xD;
speh, that no guest relishes. At the theatre he rushes in with&#xD;
splogue not announced in the bills, and tho footlights grow&#xD;
blue, the actors vanish at the side-scenes, and the trembling&#xD;
audience scatter.&#xD;
ROSEMARY (in Latin trosmarinus,) is, you know, an evergreen&#xD;
shrub. In the north of Europe an exotic; in the Mediterranean&#xD;
countries it rows naturally ; in America I have not seen it. In&#xD;
the system of Linnaeus it is one of the roses. Class II. Order&#xD;
I.  orol. ringent, upper lip 2-parted, filaments long, curved,&#xD;
simple, wth a tooth. It belongs to the 42d natural order both&#xD;
of imupe  u and  of Jussieu, called  by  the  latter the  Labiatc  ---&#xD;
af tsme to which thyme, hyssop, lavender, mint, &amp;amp;c., belong,&#xD;
al of them stomachics and tonics.  A French writer, who was&#xD;
not a botanist, and whose description is consequently intelligible&#xD;
to the unscientific, describes Rosemary (in French romarin)&#xD;
as a woody shrub, about three or four feet high (it sometimes '&#xD;
growswo 'ixor seven) and of a highly agreeable odor. Its&#xD;
numerous slender, hard and ash-colored branches are covered&#xD;
(butat regular intervals, we may observe,) with long, straight,&#xD;
narrow, stiff leaves, of a brownish green on their upper surface&#xD;
and whitish beneath. (Some of the varieties have a pale gold&#xD;
stripe or edge on the green leaf.) The flowers are small, mouth-&#xD;
shaped, with cleft lips of a pale blue, bordering on white. They&#xD;
grow mingled with the leaves, and are in bloom all the year&#xD;
round which is a peculiarity of this famous evergreen. Both&#xD;
leaves and flowers were anciently renowned in medicine, being&#xD;
esteemed highly efficacious in disorders of the brain and nerve&#xD;
Their taste is warm, pungent and bitter.&#xD;
On the shores of the Mediterranean, says another writer, this&#xD;
shrub grows in such profusion that the air is scented with the&#xD;
perfume many miles from land. In the north it does not bear&#xD;
tie winter well unless the root be planted in the hole of some&#xD;
old and broken wall. Formerly it was planted in princely gar-&#xD;
&#xD;
INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.                   9&#xD;
dens, where it was highly prized for its fragrance and mystic&#xD;
fame, and, like box, was cut and clipped into various fanciful&#xD;
figures. In the western parts of England, and on the Continent,&#xD;
it was especially affected to funeral solemnities, chaplets and&#xD;
wreaths being disposed in tie chamber or laid upon the coffin, and&#xD;
sprigs of rosemary distributed to the assistants and mourners&#xD;
while the shrub itself was planted about the grave. But be-&#xD;
sides this symbolism with death, it had another with the sweetest&#xD;
emotions of life, rosemary being eminently a lover's plant and&#xD;
mention made of it in all the amatory poetry both of the French&#xD;
and Germans.&#xD;
"There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; 'pray you, love&#xD;
remember," says Ophelia to Laertes. Another meaning isfide-&#xD;
Zity and constancy. Its funeral use, as also its amatory signifi-&#xD;
cance, may well refer to either or both of these meanings. Nor&#xD;
are they arbitrary, for-among the medicinal virtues of rose-&#xD;
mary was believed to be that of strengthening the memory.&#xD;
Accordingly, Rembertus Dodonoeus, in the Appendix to his&#xD;
learned  treatise Purgantium  Aliarumque ea Facientium,&#xD;
wherein (i. e., in appendice) he treats Variarum et guidem&#xD;
rartssimarum nonnullarumn stirpium ac forum says of this&#xD;
evergreen :-" Convenit etiam et presertimfiores omnibus capi-&#xD;
tis ac cerebri ex, frigida humidaque causa malis: cerebrum&#xD;
etenin desiccant"--they dry the brain--"sensus et menoriam&#xD;
acuunt"--they sharpen the senses and the memory. It was&#xD;
therefore, a profound calculation to plant this shrub about the&#xD;
graves of the departed; and equally so in the lover to bestow&#xD;
a sprig upon his mistress.&#xD;
Etymologically, it is said by a great lexicographer to signify&#xD;
sea-rose. In Irish it is bath-ros, which has the same meaning.&#xD;
Bt evidently the true etymology is not    e but sea-dew.&#xD;
Ovid says "rore maris," and Horace marzno rore.&#xD;
" Ut modo rore maris, modo se violave rosave&#xD;
Implicet: interdunm candentia lilia gestet,"&#xD;
which Dryden rather freely renders-.&#xD;
" Of roses, violets and fillies mix'd,&#xD;
And sprigs of flowing rosemary betwixt&#xD;
She formed the chaplet that adorn'd her'front."&#xD;

10                ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The English name is of all others the most beautiful, com-&#xD;
posed, as it is, of Rose and Mary, whereof in the princely garden&#xD;
of sanct ty one is the emblem of penitential austerity, the other&#xD;
of unspotted mortal holiness. And in this connection might&#xD;
something be said of our present purpose, touching the moral&#xD;
representation of life in fiction, that is, as bright, winning,&#xD;
sweet, captivating (if you please), even gorgeous, splendid&#xD;
and dashing, but with atra morse in the back-ground. To our&#xD;
purpose also are, eminently, the fine lines of Shenstone in his&#xD;
.Shoolmistress:-&#xD;
'Herbs too she knew, and well of each could speak&#xD;
That in her garden sipd the silvery dew;&#xD;
Where no vain flower disclosed a gaudy streak;-&#xD;
But herbs for use and physick not a few,&#xD;
Of grey renown, within those borders grew."&#xD;
" And here trim rosemarine, that whilom orown'd&#xD;
The daintiest garden of the proudest peer ;&#xD;
Ere driven from its envy'd site, it found&#xD;
A sacred shelter for its branches here,&#xD;
Where edg'd with gold its glittering skirts appear&#xD;
Oh, wassel days! oh, customs meet and well!&#xD;
Ere this was banished from its lofty sphere :&#xD;
Simplicity then sought this bumble cell,&#xD;
Nor ever would she more with thane and lordling dwell."&#xD;
" Oh, wassel days !" says Shenstone. Rosemary was used in&#xD;
Christmas festivities, and other occasions of ancient merry-mak-&#xD;
ing. They carried and scattered sprigs of rosemary in the gay&#xD;
procession of the Lord of Misrule : the mystic boar's head was&#xD;
dressed and paraded with this plant of "grey renown." Thus&#xD;
we read:-&#xD;
e"Caput Apri defero&#xD;
Reddens laudes Domino.&#xD;
The Boar's heade in handed bring T,&#xD;
With garlandes gay and rosemary,&#xD;
I pray you all sing merrily,&#xD;
Qui estis in convivio.&#xD;
To conclude :-" Rosemary" is confessedly a plant of "grey&#xD;
renown," and manifoldly mystic significance ; it is associated&#xD;
with scenes both grave and gay, with mourning and with feast-&#xD;
ing ; its classical etymology speaks to us of the dew that&#xD;

THE DOCTORS.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER       I.&#xD;
TEE DOCTORS.&#xD;
IT was in the winter of the year 185-, that a small party of&#xD;
medical students were assembled one evening in the uppermost&#xD;
story of one of the medical colleges in the city of New York.&#xD;
I have my reasons for not fixing too precisely either the date&#xD;
or the place. Who is ignorant that this great metropolis con-&#xD;
tains several flourishing medical schools I There is no objection&#xD;
to my specifying the month, however, which was February ;&#xD;
nor the ecclesiastical season-it was the carnival. I recall the&#xD;
latter circumstance because there was a huge party given the&#xD;
same night not very far from the street in which, the college is&#xD;
situate, and to which I was invited. The cream of the cream of&#xD;
what is called in New York the "Fifth Avenue" were at it, and&#xD;
I remember that there were some grievous gaps too, to the in-&#xD;
tense dissatisfaction of the hostess ; for some dozen of the very&#xD;
families who constitute the double distilled essence of the afore-&#xD;
said cream were absent; not a single representative of one of&#xD;
them was there-for they had just put on mourning. Such a&#xD;
pity ---"Why," as Mrs. Oleander observed, "why could not&#xD;
Miss Dashon have put off her decease just one week ?" But to&#xD;
return to my students.&#xD;
The apartment in which they were assembled was one of con-&#xD;
siderable size, lighted in the day-time by numerous skylights,&#xD;
at night by gas. Under the skylights, along the blank white&#xD;
walls, were ranged long tables, about breast-high'to a man ; and&#xD;
the rude forms of human beings stretched out on these table - in&#xD;
the grim repose of death, sufficiently indicated the scientific but&#xD;
revolting purpose to which the room was destined. All ages,&#xD;
every colpr, and both sexes were represented. A certain terri-&#xD;
ble neatness and order reigned. An odor, offensive, but by no&#xD;
&#xD;
means overpowering, pervaded the apartment, modified, though&#xD;
scarcely rendered more agreeable by the fumes of a cigar.&#xD;
One of the students was smoking.&#xD;
The hour was late, and all the classes had broken up, except&#xD;
one, consisting as usual of four persons, who were pursuing their&#xD;
occupation deep into the night, with the enthusiasm of science.&#xD;
On the knees of the subject a work of anatomy lay open, dis-&#xD;
closing splendid colored illustrations. The students chatted&#xD;
gaily as they plied the scalpel, for custom had long since blunted,&#xD;
at least in most of them, the horror and repugnance naturally&#xD;
excited by their occupation. But looking on while they work-&#xD;
ed, a gentleman, evidently not professionally familiar with the&#xD;
scene, did not partake of this cool indifference&#xD;
The students wore either long-sleeved aprons, or a species of&#xD;
dressing-gown, intended to supply the place of the coat, which&#xD;
was removed and hung up, to avoid contamination. The mere&#xD;
spectator was easily distinguished, therefore, by his attire, which&#xD;
indeed had the character of full evening dress, as if the wearer&#xD;
had just issued from Mrs. Oleander's party. It was black, with&#xD;
the marked peculiarities of a white cravat and waistcoat, and a&#xD;
bit of red ribbon at one of the button-holes of the coat. The&#xD;
physiognomy of this member of the party agreed with these&#xD;
slightly foreign indications of his dress. He was barely above&#xD;
the middle height, and the stoutness of his frame seemed to&#xD;
lessen his stature. His features were well cut, but inclining to&#xD;
the square in contour, his complexion colorless rather than pale,&#xD;
the hair light brown and clipped rather short so as to display&#xD;
the whole expanse of a fine intellectual brow; his blue Scandi-&#xD;
navian eye was gentle in expression; and the very resolute,&#xD;
strongly modelled mouth was shaded with a long, heavy, mili-&#xD;
taire-like and almost yellow moustache. A white kid glove,&#xD;
fitting a very handsome hand, a gibus or crush-up hat, which&#xD;
he carried under his arm, and a short clpak richly furred, com-&#xD;
pleted a figure so much out of keepir , with the place that it&#xD;
has naturally arrested our attention.&#xD;
A young man-he might be eight and twenty--who appeared&#xD;
to be the leader or teacher of the class, and whose scalpel,&#xD;
evidently of no ordinary power and delicacy, had just finished&#xD;

a beautiful demonstration of the neck with its curious net&#xD;
work of nerves and vesse's, looked up over his gold-rimmed&#xD;
spectacles at the gentleman we have described, and said with&#xD;
a slight smile that imparted a momentary expression of shrewd-&#xD;
ness and sarcasm to a singularly heavy pair of lips,-&#xD;
"You are so familiar with death on the battle-field, I&#xD;
suppose, Count Wissen, that a dissecting room has no effect on&#xD;
your nerves ?"&#xD;
"On the contrary," replied the gentleman thus addressed,&#xD;
t    after a moment's pause, and with winning frankness; "I do&#xD;
not remember to have experienced even in my first battle a&#xD;
more vivid emotion than , for the first few moments after I&#xD;
entered and saw you at your work."&#xD;
" Really ! I should not have thought it !" replied the young&#xD;
physician.&#xD;
" In a battle we destroy life, we mutilate the living, but all&#xD;
rudely, violently ; this calm scientific penetration into the mys-&#xD;
terious mechanism of life itself is to me more appalling. That&#xD;
a human being-a man-should be killed, seems to me quite&#xD;
natural under certain circumstances : but to make that man the&#xD;
object of physical analysis-that crushes me, doctor.'"&#xD;
Count Wissen spoke our language with fluent elegance, but&#xD;
with an accent that perhaps added to the charm of what he said.&#xD;
" And what 'ud become of the nob'e art of healing, then,&#xD;
without the physical analysis of man ?" demanded a student&#xD;
who was engaged in physically analyzing the fasciae that play so&#xD;
important a part in crural hernia. It was a young man of four&#xD;
'of'five and twenty, of herculean proportions, ardent in expres-&#xD;
sion, black-haired, black-eyed, irregular but strikingly intelli-&#xD;
gent features, and with something indefinable about him that&#xD;
marked the peasant. "Them big wounds, Count, that military&#xD;
gentlemen like yourself make in the big battles,-how would we&#xD;
ever cure them at all, if it was'nt for the physical analysis of&#xD;
man-answer me that, if you please ?'"&#xD;
" Oh ! I admit the profound utility of your present occupa-&#xD;
tion, Mr. O'Cal-lagh-an I" responded the count, laughing, and&#xD;
pronouncing every syllable of the Irishman's gutteral name with&#xD;
foreign distinctness. .&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DOCTORS-                    15&#xD;
"Well,".said O'Callaghan, "this is the leanest subject that I&#xD;
have physically analyzed"--glancing round with a mirthful&#xD;
expression in his keen black eyes--." that I have physically&#xD;
analyzed, as your excellency says, for a long time."&#xD;
"The leanest of its sex, perhaps," observed the young man&#xD;
who had first spoken, quietly pursuing his dissection.&#xD;
"Why, the female sex, Dr. Galenson, has a greater tendency&#xD;
to the deposition of adipose matter---ye may- well say that,"&#xD;
joined OCallaghan. "And hence we are naturally induced to&#xD;
inquire into the cause which produced the emaciation in the&#xD;
present instance."&#xD;
"This girl died of phthisis," answered Galenson.&#xD;
"How in the name o' th' old boy. can ye tell that, before&#xD;
ye've dissected the thoracic viscera 'V' demanded the other.&#xD;
"I make the prediction at all events, Mr. O'Callaghan,"&#xD;
rejoined Galenson, "that whenever it shall please my friend&#xD;
*Fitzfulke to quit this lady's scalp and open her chest, we shall&#xD;
find the lungs devoured by cavities and gorged with tubercle."&#xD;
Fitzfulke, who was smoking, delicately removed the cigar&#xD;
from his mouth with his fore and middle finger and said:-.&#xD;
"Galenson is always right in his predictions."&#xD;
"I would like to know on what grounds our worthy preceptor&#xD;
. proceeds in this instance," persisted tht inquisitive O'Callaghan.&#xD;
The abdominal viscera were perfectly healthy, Mr. O'Cal-&#xD;
laghan. There were no typhoid lesions, no miliary eruptions,&#xD;
yet the fat has totally disappeared, and the muscular tissue is&#xD;
excessively soft and attenuated."&#xD;
"Tabes dorsals " cried O'Callaghan, triumphantly, with the&#xD;
purest continental pronunciation of the Latin.&#xD;
A possible hypothesis," said Fitzfulke, again removing his&#xD;
cigar, " and one that tallies with the mode of life too evidently&#xD;
led by this young woman."&#xD;
There was a slight pause before any one replied, and then&#xD;
alenson said:-  Mr. Fitzfulke is a poet. To him a subject on&#xD;
the dissecting-table is not simply a subject, but-but what.Fitz ?"&#xD;
The mortal remains of a human, and hence suggestive of a&#xD;
human history," replied the student, with a mixture of humor&#xD;
and pomposity.&#xD;

" Which in this case was the history of-an fortunate T'&#xD;
inquired the count.&#xD;
"Ye may well say that," answered the ever-ready O'Cal-&#xD;
laghan. "It is, as I may say, the natural upshot of the career&#xD;
-a private slip, a public disgrace, the streets, the hospital, the&#xD;
dissecting-table.".,&#xD;
"We may as well put that in our pipes and smoke it,"&#xD;
observed Fitzfulke, who was trying to light a fresh cigar by te&#xD;
gas-burner--" that our frail lady friends"-puff-" are all liable"&#xD;
.-puff---" to come to this complexion"-puff' third-" infer-&#xD;
nally soon !".'&#xD;
"You have wonderfully dissipated my Horror of dissection&#xD;
already," said the count, slightly laughing,-" if indeed it is&#xD;
from this class that your female subjects are supplied ?"&#xD;
"Almost exclusively," said Galenson. ." In fact, count, we&#xD;
should be glad for scientific reasons, if it were not quite so&#xD;
exclusively."&#xD;
"Providence, Dr. Galenson, watches over modesty even in&#xD;
the grave !" said O'Callaghan, with an air of profound con-&#xD;
viction.&#xD;
"I hope Rory lays all this to heart !" said Fitzfulke, glancing&#xD;
at the fourth student, who had not yet spoken. ," If your&#xD;
morals, young man, are not improved here, where will they be,&#xD;
I'd like to know ?" added he, grinning sardonically, and knock-&#xD;
ing off his ashes against the arm of the subject-" ashes to&#xD;
ashes, eh ?"&#xD;
The youth thus addressed by his Christian name was the&#xD;
youngest of the party, smooth-chinned, and eminently hand-&#xD;
some. In lieu of the calico apron or gown worn by his .com-&#xD;
panions, hpwas arrayed in an old dark green wrapper, with a&#xD;
velvet collar and braid-buttons: though frayed with use, it had&#xD;
a picturesque effect ; and he dissected in gloves-a spooney-like&#xD;
refinement which might be ascribed either to uncommon deli-.&#xD;
cacy or fear of infection .-for the most horrible death is some-'&#xD;
times caused by a dissection scratch. Notwithstanding this -&#xD;
effeminacy, and a certain girlish softness in his manner, the&#xD;
carriage of, his lead was strikingly noble ; and a finely turned&#xD;
and masculine throat rose out of his open collar, over which an&#xD;
&#xD;
abundance of rich tawny-brown hair fell like the mane of a&#xD;
young lion im picturesque carelessness.&#xD;
" Fitzfulke giving lessons in morality to Rory," said Galen-&#xD;
son, laughing: for the youth blushed, but did not reply.&#xD;
"Mr. Fitzfulke is a poet," observed Count Wissen politely,&#xD;
"but my friend Rory is an artist, after all: one may therefore&#xD;
properly counsel the other."&#xD;
"They're a pair of Bohemians together, and sure it's every&#xD;
bit of what they've in common," said O'Callaghan, with a satiri-&#xD;
cal glance. This remark cut both ways ; for Fitzfulke was no&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
"We offer a curious fortuitous reunion of professions here to-&#xD;
night, count," remarked Galenson. "Mr. Fitzfulke is a man&#xD;
of letters-a Bohemian (as Mr. O'Callaghan says)-whom the&#xD;
will of his father alone constrains to study the more practical&#xD;
art of healing ; our friend Rory (to whom we are indebted for&#xD;
your company, count, this evening) is a sculptor, as you are&#xD;
aware, who pursues anatomy simply as a branch of art."&#xD;
"Does he handle the chisel now with gloves, as well as the&#xD;
scalpel?'" asked O'Callaghan, with another smile of malice.&#xD;
"And Mr. O'Callaghan was educated for a priest," pursued&#xD;
the imperturbable Galenson.&#xD;
"Which he'd been a-wearing a soutane down to his heels&#xD;
before this." said Fitzfulke, energetically, giving a terrible long&#xD;
puff from the cigar, "but for his too decided penchant for a&#xD;
petticoat."&#xD;
There was a general laugh at O'Callaghan's expense, in which&#xD;
even the modest Rory joined.&#xD;
"It's a slander," said O'Callaghan, reddening violently, but&#xD;
with perfect good humor.&#xD;
"Count Wissen," added Galenson, "is a soldier and a diplo-&#xD;
mat."&#xD;
"Two pernicious professions !" said the count, laughing.&#xD;
"Say not so," replied Fitzfulke, pompously. "if I were not"&#xD;
.-puff---" a Bohemian, I would be-Count Wissen !"&#xD;
"Thank you., Mr. Fitzfulke !" said the count, bowing low.&#xD;
"In fine," said Dr. Galenson, "I am the sole pure and simple&#xD;
original doctor in the company."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Of whom all New York knows that Dr. Galenson is the&#xD;
prince of quizzers, and the most promising of all the devotees&#xD;
of pathological anatomy," said O'Callaghan, with Celtic fluency.&#xD;
"The prince of quizzers ?" said the count, inquiringly.&#xD;
"To quiz, count, in the language of the medical schools, is&#xD;
to examine a class on the course. All these gentlemen here&#xD;
attend my quiz," said Dr. Galenson.&#xD;
"See what it is to visit a dissecting-room; I have learned&#xD;
several new things this evening, already," said the count ;--&#xD;
"thanks to your politeness, gentlemen, and the invitation of my&#xD;
friend, Mr. Rory."&#xD;
"In truth, we're a curious company altogether," pursued&#xD;
O'Callaghan--" for example, in an ethnological point of view."&#xD;
"Pray,.don't get on that subject, O'Callaghan!" ejaculated&#xD;
Galenson, "or we shall have the whole question of races on the&#xD;
tapis."&#xD;
"Except yourself, count," continued O'Callaghan, not heed-&#xD;
ing the remonstrance, "every one of us has a patronymical&#xD;
name, indicative of the antiquity of our origin. Galenson, for&#xD;
example, signifies son of Galen, and shows a Danish ancestry.&#xD;
Fitzfulke equally means son of Foulke or Fulk, showing that&#xD;
our friend Fitz here is a Saxon. O'Callaghan, or as it was for-&#xD;
merly written-O'Callaghain--imports son of Calla-ghain, who&#xD;
was a descendant of Oliol Olum of the race of Heber, one of&#xD;
the sons of Milesius---"&#xD;
"I told you so !" cried Dr. Galenson, laughing--" we shall&#xD;
have the entire genealogy of the kings of Munster now I'&#xD;
"From another of whose sons, that is from Ir," continued&#xD;
the imperturbable O'Callagban, motioning down the interruption&#xD;
of his preceptor with a wave of his scalpel, "were descended&#xD;
the Clanna-Rorys or Rodericians, of whom was Rory More,&#xD;
otherwise Roderick the Great, King of Ulster, whose descend-&#xD;

call O'More, and sometimes O'Moore ; but the true name is&#xD;

princely blood in Ireland flows in their veins, count; though&#xD;
they were only chiefs or lords of Leix in the wars of the faith,&#xD;
&#xD;
when the ancestor and namesake of our young friend here,&#xD;
RoRY O'MoRRA, was the bravest ally of the great O'Neill-.--"&#xD;
"Oh, good Lord ! O'Callaghan !" cried young O'Morra, laugh-&#xD;
ing, "spare us the wars of the princely Tyrone, I beg !"&#xD;
''is odd," said the count, "that I never think of Mr. Rory&#xD;
being Irish, although his name of course shows it."&#xD;
"He is not Irish,'' said Fitzfulke, sententiously.  "As well&#xD;
call me an Englishman, because my ancestors two hundred&#xD;
years ago lived in Yorkshire. O'Morra and his father before&#xD;
him were born in America."&#xD;
"His father was born in America, Mr. Fitzfulke--I consent&#xD;
to that," replied O'Callaghan; "but who were his parients ?"--&#xD;
mimicking the Yankee accent of Fitzfulke. "Weren't they&#xD;
Irish born and bred ' If CahalO'Morra's not an Irishman-who&#xD;
is I As for Rory here, like the- rest of the young generation,&#xD;
he is Americanized, as you call it, quite too much ; an' his dis-&#xD;
secting in white gloves doesn't show the dare-devil spirit of the&#xD;
old O'Morras-hark ! what's that ?"&#xD;
A loud knocking at the door below made all present start. It&#xD;
was not the entrance of the college, but the exit of a private&#xD;
stair and narrow passage leading from the dissecting-room to&#xD;
the general staircase of the building.&#xD;
." Who in thunder's that I" said Fitzfulke.&#xD;
"Somebody wanting Hartley," suggested Galenson, quietly&#xD;
pursuing his dissection.&#xD;
"Ye may well say it is some body wanting Hartley," rejoined&#xD;
O'Callaghan. "Goodness knows that if anything is like to call up&#xD;
the old janitor at this hour of the night, it'll be a body with&#xD;
never a soul in it. Will I open the door, boys I''&#xD;
"If you think fit, youmay," said Galenson.&#xD;
"Sure it's none of my business, but seeing the old reprobate&#xD;
is gone to Jersey to look after his mother that's dying, I'll do it&#xD;
for him this once."&#xD;
With these words, rather intended to save his own dignity&#xD;
than proceeding from any real disinclination to perform the&#xD;
office, O'Callaghan wiped his fingers on a coarse sheet, and de-&#xD;
parted to open the door below, where the knocking was now&#xD;

a gentleman whom he introduced in a rather cerenfonious tone,&#xD;
saying-&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin, gentlemen!"&#xD;
The new-comer was a very striking figure, being very tall&#xD;
and draped in a long cloak of fine drab cloth, with a collar of&#xD;
sable, contrasting very effectively with an underdress of black,&#xD;
of the Quaker cut, and terminating below in black silk stock-&#xD;
ings and knee-breeches. His shoes were of buckskin, with&#xD;
large silver shoe-buckles. The head and face of the stranger&#xD;
were lean, exhibiting their bony structure with remarkable dis-&#xD;
Cinctness ; his beard was cleanly shaven off, leaving only a little&#xD;
inch of well-trimmed whisker in front of each ear ; the hair&#xD;
cropped short: he had removed a broad-brimmed but glossy&#xD;
black beaver as he entered, and perceived the dissecting class.&#xD;
His complexion was dark and pale, his features far from regu-&#xD;
lar, yet not without a certain look of intellect and distinction,&#xD;
to which a large and piercing though stealthy black eye very&#xD;
much contributed. He smiled as he bowed to the company,&#xD;
showing a set of white and glittering teeth.&#xD;
"Doctor Mannikin ! To what are we indebted for this unex-&#xD;
pected honor ?" said Galenson, laying down his scalpel in&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"Your servant, Dr. Galenson-pleasure of meeting you at&#xD;
the hospital, doctor-can't shake hands, eh ?-I understand.&#xD;
Expected to see only my old friend Hartley on a little matter of&#xD;
business-professional business"--with the same brilliant smile&#xD;
as before.&#xD;
"Can Dr. Mannikin require a 'subject' t" replied Galenson,&#xD;
resuming his sang froicZ, aid with his usual careless laugh. "I&#xD;
thought your experiments, Doctor, were made not upon the dead&#xD;
but the living. But I beg pardon for not introducing you to&#xD;

"But not of the same celebrity," said the count, who, not&#xD;
being embarrassed by any contamination, shook hands. with the&#xD;
new-comer, after the American fashion.&#xD;
"2if, as I infer," said Dr. Mannikin, "Count Wissen is the Re-&#xD;
sident Minister of His Majesty the King of ----, at Washington,&#xD;
his disclaimer has more of sarcasm than of modesty."&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin's work on 'Celebrated Cases of Poisoning'&#xD;
enjoys a European reputation," observed O'Callaghan, who&#xD;
could not be long without putting in his oar. "And really,&#xD;
doctor, I'd be for just creating a professorship of Toxicology in&#xD;
the college for yourself; it would be for our advantage greatly."&#xD;
"Whether it would be for the advantage of the college to in-&#xD;
stitute a professorship of the Art of Poisoning-which is the&#xD;
meaning of Toxicology-may perhaps be doubted," said Galen-&#xD;
son drily ; whereat Fitzfulke laughed.&#xD;
"In Italy, doctor," said the count with courtesy, "in the&#xD;
time of the Borgias, your peculiar erudition would have made&#xD;
your fortune.'&#xD;
"Equally in America !" exclaimed O'Callaghan.   "Sure,&#xD;
what with wives that want to poison their husbands, and hus-&#xD;
bands willing to serve them the same good turn, a toxicologist&#xD;
never need starve, if the learned doctor will pardon me the ob-'&#xD;
servation."&#xD;
"Unfortunately," said Dr. Mannikin, with his peculiar smile,&#xD;
"our skill is seldom called in till too late, when it serves rather&#xD;
to detect crime than to prevent it--which (Dr. Galenson will&#xD;
excuse the for saying) are the legitimate objects of toxicology."&#xD;
"It is never called in to facilitate crime, then, doctor 'i" in-&#xD;
quired Galenson, carelessly.&#xD;
"Persons who meditate suicide or murder seldom consult the&#xD;
regular faculty on the means, I imagine," replied the toxicolo-&#xD;
gist, with composure.&#xD;
"No," said Galenson, peering at his medical brother over his&#xD;
gold-rimmed spectacles ;-" but I should imagine that in a city&#xD;
like this, considering the almost mysterious knowledge attributed&#xD;
to you by the profession as well as by the public, you must&#xD;

" Medical men are often the recipients of strange confidences&#xD;
I confess," replied Dr. Mannikin, with an air of frankness.&#xD;
" You possess some powerful oriental drugs, not known to&#xD;
our pharmaceutists, do you not, doctor ."&#xD;
"I have said so in my published treatise."&#xD;
"You became acquainted with them in India '&#xD;
" Ah ! the doctor has travelled !" said the count.&#xD;
"'A Thibetian juggler, whom I met in Cashmere," said Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin with an air of mystery, "communicated to me some .&#xD;
exceedingly potent agents, the knowledge of which has been&#xD;
transmitted from age to age, for perhaps thousands and tens of&#xD;
thousands of years, by the magical guilds of the East.".&#xD;
The young men all regarded Dr. Mannikih with curiosity :&#xD;
but O'Callaghan said in an under-tone--" Tens of thousands of&#xD;
years ! pooh ! Before the creation of the world ."&#xD;
"This is very piquant," observed Count Wissen. "I am&#xD;
more than ever convinced that my adventure to-night was a&#xD;
good inspiration, Mr. Rory. Pray, doctor, may I ask-were&#xD;
you initiated in the guild of which you speak V"&#xD;
"There is no other mode of penetrating the secret," replied&#xD;
the toxicologist, solemnly.&#xD;
"Humph i" said Galenson. "And is it true that these Indian&#xD;
fellows have drugs with which they can simulate trance and&#xD;
produce apparent death ''&#xD;
"They have."&#xD;
"Did you witness such an experiment yourself, doctor !'&#xD;
inquired the count.&#xD;
Did respiration cease ?" demanded Galenson.&#xD;
"To all external seeming the fellow was as dead as one of&#xD;
these subjects," replied Mannikin.  "The only discoverable&#xD;
" indication of life was a faint warmth about the heart."&#xD;
"And this condition lasted 'I"&#xD;
-"six weeks,"* answered the toxicologist, with a flush. "But&#xD;
* For a more particular account of this wonderful feat, and for&#xD;
evidence of the singular knowledge of the oriental jugglers in drugs,&#xD;

'  The count was civilly answering this query, while the students&#xD;
in an under-tone discussed the probability and possibility of Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin's story, with little apparent faith in that distinguished&#xD;
gentleman's veracity, when the attention of all parties was again&#xD;
arrested by a thundering knock at the lower door.&#xD;
, Perdition seize old Hartley and his mother !" exclaimed&#xD;
O'Callaghan, petulantly :--" no, not the mother---the old soul is&#xD;
"near ninety, and has a right to die sometime, as well as another,"&#xD;
he added. "Well, I'll just see who it is for this once !"&#xD;
"I bet it is some of those fellows in old Varick's office, out&#xD;
on an infernal spree! said Fitzfulke. "Oh, durri your noise !"&#xD;
The knocking recommenced with violence, and O'Callaghan&#xD;
quickened his steps toward the stair.&#xD;
Count Wissen here nudged the silent and shy young O'Morra,&#xD;
directing his attention to the countenance of Dr. Mannikin,&#xD;
which, in spite of an habitual self-command, changed its wonted&#xD;
paleness to a color approaching parchment. Galenson's quick&#xD;
eye caught the count's movement and observed its cause, and&#xD;
he said-&#xD;
"Why, doctor, do you expect the marble guest ?"&#xD;
Meanwhile, O'Callaghan had opened the lower door. The&#xD;
heavy tramp of men was then heard alongthe narrow passage&#xD;
and slowly ascending the stairs; and presently appeared,&#xD;
ushered in by O'Callaghan, two men, one white, the other a&#xD;
negro, carrying with some difficulty a metallic burial-case,&#xD;
covered with the richest black velvet, and adorned with handles,&#xD;
caps aud inscription-plate of massive silver. They came forward&#xD;
of India. This manuwas actually buried for six weeks, and on being&#xD;
exhumed and stimulated by pungent applications, came to life&#xD;
again. The experiment, however, was a dangerous One; for being&#xD;
afterwards persuaded by a considerable sum of money to repeat it, to&#xD;
gratify the curiosity of some English officers, the unfortunate wretch&#xD;
could not be resuscitated : the vital spark, reduced to a feeble glim.&#xD;

The students simultaneously stopped work. Such a mode of&#xD;
bringing in a subject was too unusual not to excite the utmost&#xD;
surprise. A coarse bag and naked body is the wonted style of&#xD;
the resurrectionist, or " sack-em-up"-to use an expressive old&#xD;

friendless and proscribed classes of society that materials are&#xD;

CHAPTER II&#xD;
THE MARBLE BRIDE.&#xD;
THE two men stood panting from their exertion, as reason&#xD;
was they should, for the metallic cases are heavy, and this was&#xD;
of the adult size, and octagon shape ; and the students regarded&#xD;
them with curiosity and suspicion: it was evident to the least&#xD;
practised glance that they were not professional resurrectionists.&#xD;
Galenson had never seen them before, and he had been demon-&#xD;
strator of anatomy for three years. O'Callaghan, in the fourth&#xD;
winter of his studies, was equally unable to recognize them.&#xD;
The white fellow was stout and thick set. He wore a large&#xD;
slouched hat and a rough long-haired over-oat, that left no part&#xD;
of his underdress visible, except a pair of tall boots, drawn over&#xD;
his trowsers, and encasing a stout pair of legs. A small cold&#xD;
blue eye, a nose pointed upwards, a sly and sensual mouth,&#xD;
with indications of good feeding in the chin and cheek, bespoke&#xD;
the lower order of the Saxon : his brown whiskers were trimmed&#xD;
English fashion ; it was the face of a London footman, groom&#xD;
or valet-a menial of some sort. He gazed round the com-&#xD;
pany without any sign of recognition till his eye rested on the&#xD;
quaker-like figure of Dr. Mannikin, when a slight start and&#xD;
rush of b'ood to the face, indicated one equally unexpected&#xD;
and unwelcome ; and he, as if involuntarily, touched his hat.&#xD;
The negro was a dapper, light-colored fellow. His copious and&#xD;
well-combed wool was surmounted with a paper cap, such as&#xD;
is frequently worn by cooks, and notwithstanding the season&#xD;
he wore no overcoat.&#xD;
"We 'ad expected to find Mr. 'Artley," said the white resur-&#xD;
rectionist, in a true Cockney accent.&#xD;
"He is out," said Galenson, curtly.&#xD;
"Ow werry hawkward, Jim !" said the fellow, addressing his&#xD;

black companion. "In regard of this 'ere body w'ich we-'ave&#xD;
fetch'd from Greenwood, I means, gentlemen."&#xD;
"It's rather odd you did not leave the coffin behind," observed&#xD;
Galenson, drily. " We have no use for that, you know."&#xD;
I can heasily hexplain that little circumstance, doctor," re-&#xD;
plied the sack-ern-up. " We couldn't hopen this 'ere bur'al case&#xD;
for want of proper instruments, as when we 'ad took bout the&#xD;
screws, we found as 'ow the hopper shell was soddered on to&#xD;
the hunder, and it warn't possible to break the cement without&#xD;
makin' too much noise : so we just took the 'ole concern-that&#xD;
is 'ow it was, doctor."_&#xD;
"An' a tarnal close shave we had getten off wid it, too, Massa&#xD;
Johnson," said the negro: "it so tarnal heavy, sa&#xD;
"I thought they took better precautions at Greenwood," said&#xD;
Galenson, thoughtfully eying the sumptuous coffin.&#xD;
"Oh, 'ang their precautions !" said Johnson: "we fetched this&#xD;
'ere case through the gate hunder their heyes-didn't we, Jim ?"_&#xD;
" P'raps de gemman like to buy dis body for 'section," sug-&#xD;
gested the negro: "him was bur'd dis berry arternoon, doctor.&#xD;
My stars ! what a long string of carriages foller dis ere corpse to&#xD;
Greenwood!"&#xD;
"That's a lie, I bet," remarked Fitzfulke, who had been ex-&#xD;
amining the inscription-plate. "The plate says the subject died&#xD;
a week ago! You shouldn't have brought the coffin, if you&#xD;
wanted us to believe such chaffing as that."&#xD;
"Taint no lie, massa," replied the negro, mildly. "Dis 'ere&#xD;
corpse kep so uncommon well dat dey nebber bury him till dis&#xD;
arternoon. De doctors can open de case an' see for demselves&#xD;
wat ex'lent preserwation de subjek is in. A mighty purty young&#xD;
lady, too !"&#xD;
"By George ! a subject of this description does not offer every&#xD;
day in the year !" cried Fitzfulke, exultingly.&#xD;
"Dry up, Fitz !" said O'Callaghan, in a wrathful under tone.&#xD;
"What sort of notion you must have of the designs of Provi-&#xD;
dence!"S&#xD;
But Dr. Mannikin, who had approached and ptood with his&#xD;
white-gloved hand resting delicately on the velvet pall, now&#xD;
spoke, in his blandest manner&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MARBLE BRIDE.           27&#xD;
&#xD;
" I came here this evening to treat with Mr. Hartley for a sub-&#xD;
ject, and from what you say, Mr. Johnson, this would suit&#xD;
me. What will you take for it, burial-case and all. just as it&#xD;
stands?"&#xD;
The man touched his hat and grinned.&#xD;
"Couldn't sell the case, nor the clothes, no how, doctor."&#xD;
" Why, what can you do with them better than to sell them,&#xD;
my friend ?" asked the doctor.&#xD;
"That's hour business, doctor, not your'n," replied the fellow,&#xD;
with another grin.&#xD;
"Well, never mind the case," said Dr. Mannikin. "You&#xD;
shall have the case, and everything else you choose"-with a&#xD;
meaning emphasis: "I only want the body-what will you take&#xD;
for it ?-name your price."&#xD;
The negro whispered in his comrade's ear-but Dr. Galenson&#xD;
here interposed.&#xD;
"Excuse me, doctor," said the young physician, politely but&#xD;
firmly. "You appear not to be acquainted with one of the&#xD;
rules of the college in this department, which, as Demonstrator&#xD;
of Anatomy, I am obliged to enforce. No subject which has&#xD;
once been brought here is allowed to be taken hence, unless by&#xD;
the janitor for sepulture ; and although you might be allowed to&#xD;
join a class already formed (with the consent of the members),&#xD;
you could not expect otherwise to get a subject under a month,&#xD;
from the number of classes now on the list and entitled to a&#xD;
preference. I shall of course buy the present subject of these&#xD;
men, at the regular price, neither more nor less, but it will have&#xD;
to go to the first class on the list and unsupplied."&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin's pale cheek flushed and grew pale again, al-&#xD;
ternately, as Galenson proceeded : "Really, Dr. Galenson !" said&#xD;
he, in tones that trembled with anger, "this is discourteous.&#xD;
My professional rank will, I hope, justify a departure from mere&#xD;
formal rules in my favor."&#xD;
"I have every disposition in the world to gratify you, doctor,"&#xD;
replied Galenson, with extreme suavity, "but if we break our&#xD;
rules for onewe must for ,another, and I have no authority to&#xD;
do it. Your course is to apply to the Professor of Anatomy&#xD;

&#xD;
--if he says you can have the subject, I shall have nothing to&#xD;
say."&#xD;
"Besides, doctor," said the man Johnson, to whom the negro&#xD;
had been again earnestly whispering--" we prefers, Jim and&#xD;
me, to let the doctors of the college 'ave the subjik. Should&#xD;
hany hinquiries be made in regard of the disappearance of the&#xD;
same, do yur see, 'ere there would be no traces, cos why ? there&#xD;
is so many others. An' I would hadvise, gentlemen, to begin&#xD;
with the face, so as it can't be recognized by nobody."&#xD;
"Infernal scoundrel !" muttered Dr. Mannikin.&#xD;
Dr. Galenson, meanwhile, took out his pocket-book, and.&#xD;
handing the man Johnson the usual resurrectionist's fee, said--&#xD;
" Let us open the case, that these fellows may take it away&#xD;
immediately: for certainly we do not want it here. Do you&#xD;
know how to manage these machines, O'Callaghan ."&#xD;
"Do I know how ' replied that gentleman, working out the&#xD;
massive silver-headed screws with his fingers, so rapidly that&#xD;
Fitzfulke, who was unscrewing the silver cap or head-piece,&#xD;
barely succeeded in doing it before his active fellow-student had&#xD;
all the other screws in his hand. The cap being raised, a thick&#xD;
but clear oval glass, like a plate of crystal, allowed the face&#xD;
of the corpse to be seen.-&#xD;
"My God !" cried Fitzfulke : "what a beautiful face !"&#xD;
A simultaneous movement of curiosity impelled the young&#xD;
men to look in. All started at beholding a countenance so&#xD;
natural that it seemed living, and all encadrde with flowers and&#xD;
lace and soft curls, like a waxen beauty, on which the bright&#xD;
gas-light fell. Dr. Mannikin interposed again.&#xD;
"Gentlemen, you will pardon me for saying once more that&#xD;
this thing ought to go no further. You will not deny my right&#xD;
to protest, when I tell you that this young person was known&#xD;
to me."&#xD;
"A patient, doctor ?" asked Galenson, smiling.&#xD;
"Not my patient," replied the physician, quickly ; "but I&#xD;
know the family well, and attended the funeral to-day.".&#xD;
"Indeed !" said Dr. Galenson.&#xD;
This announcement again vividly excited the curiosity of the&#xD;
students. They all, together with the stately count, bent their&#xD;
&#xD;
heads over the plate to read the inscription, which Fitzfulke now&#xD;
read aloud:--&#xD;
OB. III NON. FEB. MDCCCL-&#xD;
AET. XVIII.&#xD;
"There is no family name on the plate," observed Count&#xD;
Wissen.&#xD;
The cement with which the upper and lower shells of the&#xD;
case were almost welded together, now yielded to a single well-&#xD;
directed blow of O'Callaghan's hammer. The removal of the&#xD;
lid caused a fresh surprise, for it was then fully seen that the cos.&#xD;
tume (for the body was dressed as in life) was that of a bride.&#xD;
A robe of white moire antique, enriched with deep flounces of&#xD;
point lace, was no sooner released from the compression of the&#xD;
lid, than it flowed im great folds on either side ; a veil of the&#xD;
same costly lace almost entirely shrouded the upper part of the&#xD;
figure, while a wreath of white jessamine with long delicate&#xD;
green sprays, and bouquets of the same on the bosom and skirt,&#xD;
nestling among the lace, made a whole so festive, so fresh, so&#xD;
elegant, that the young men drew back and gazed in silent&#xD;
admiration and awe, But what was really extraordinary, and&#xD;
soon riveted their attention, even the rich jewels of the bride&#xD;
had not been removed. A magnificent necklace of pearls&#xD;
clasped the marble throat, a chain of brooches of the same,&#xD;
looped together by strings of seed-pearl, served as buttons to the&#xD;
square-cut antique corsage, and earrings and a bracelet, complet-&#xD;
ing the set, attested both the wealth and the frantic despair of a&#xD;
father or a husband.--And perhaps the beauty of the de-&#xD;
ceased deserved so rich a burial. It was a face, even in the rig-&#xD;
idity of death, singularly noble and beautiful; whiter than snout&#xD;
the perfect features, carved lip and nostril, closed eye deep-lid-&#xD;
ded, smooth brow and oval cheek, set in dark flowing tresses,&#xD;
and crowned with jessamine ; the gorge, as if turned in ivory;&#xD;
the large pearl-white arms-the hands were gloved and tied to-&#xD;
gether with white satin ribbon.&#xD;
The students looked to Dr. Mannikin for an explanation of&#xD;
this extraordinary case.&#xD;

" She was an only child-her family immensely rich-and&#xD;
died, as you see, on her wedding-night, before the very altar.&#xD;
They buried her in her bridal array-by her own desire," said&#xD;
that gentleman, in brief, curt tones.&#xD;
"All dese tings," observed the negro, "'longs to me and .&#xD;
Massa Johnson."&#xD;
"Hof course they does-w'at be you a-talking about, Jim ?"&#xD;
said his companion.&#xD;
"One begins to understand the motive of this body-snatching&#xD;
extraordinary," remarked Galenson.&#xD;
"It is pretty well understood already," said the count, "but&#xD;
it is robbery after all."&#xD;
"What will we do about it l" asked O'Callag  , with great&#xD;
seriousness,r&#xD;
"Do ?" repeated Galenson. "We take the body, of course,&#xD;
and these men the case, clothes and jewels-and a pretty good&#xD;
thing they've made of it too.-I wonder what was the cause&#xD;
of death."&#xD;
The medical enthusiast was already touching the wrist of the&#xD;
corpse, as if to satisfy himself by more senses than one that life&#xD;
was really departed.&#xD;
"The cause of death, doctor!" said O'Callaghan. "Undoubt-&#xD;
edly we will ascertain that in the interests of science-but&#xD;
then?"&#xD;
"You mean to say, Mr. O'Callaghan ?"&#xD;
"That although the body of this young lady has fallen into&#xD;
our hands by the legitimate chances of the profession, it ought&#xD;
y        not to be profaned by the last scrutiny of the scalpel."&#xD;
=. "Hanged if I see why not," said Fitzfulke, rather coarsely.&#xD;
"After a legitimate autopsy," pursued O'Callaghan, "we&#xD;
should restore the remains to their resting-place, which has&#xD;
been violated by what we must regard as a fortunate sacrilege."&#xD;
"But how," said Galenson. "It is not so easy to effect an&#xD;
interment secretly. You may rob a grave with impunity, but to&#xD;
fil one, except by forms of law or in regular practice,-it is&#xD;
dangerous !"&#xD;
But the man Johnson, who with his colored comrade, had&#xD;
shown various signs of impatience dn   this colloquy, now&#xD;
&#xD;
attempted to' push his way violently through the ring of stu-&#xD;
dents that closely surrounded the table where the coffin with&#xD;
its brilliant contents lay.&#xD;
" Hif you please, gents ! We wishes to remove hour property&#xD;
now. Young gentleman !" addressing O'Morra, "please stand on&#xD;
one side, and let me get to this 'ere coffin."&#xD;
The youth turned quick as lightning and threw him off. The&#xD;
rest stared.&#xD;
"Why, Rory ! what's tne matter, man'?" cried Fitzfulke.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said Rory O'Morra, "of course I agree with&#xD;
my friend Mr. O'Callaghan, that to dissect the body of a virtuous&#xD;
and beautiful young lady which has fallen into our hands through&#xD;
an infamous crime, is out of the question. To allow it to be&#xD;
stripped of its attire or ornaments by these rascals appears to&#xD;
me equally impossible. They are a pair of common thieves, and&#xD;
so sure as they offer to lay a finger on a single article, I will&#xD;
have them arrested."&#xD;
"You will-will you ?" cried Johnson, white with rage. Then&#xD;
swearing a great oath, he-drew forth a formidable knife from&#xD;
under his great coat,-" we'll see to that !"&#xD;
"Cut-throat! I thought as much !" said the shy O'Morra,&#xD;
without the slightest symptom of fear.&#xD;
There were loud cries of "Put up your knife !"-" Seize hold&#xD;
of the rascal !"-" Put away thy knife, Enoch Johnson-dpu&#xD;
away thy knife !" quoth Dr. Ezekiel Mannikin, lifting both his&#xD;
hands. But in the twinkling of an eye young O'Morra drew&#xD;
back a step, took down a cane that lay across the pegs on which'&#xD;
the students' coats and overcoats were suspended, and in far less&#xD;
time than-it takes to tell it, had bared a long, slender, triangu-&#xD;
lar blade of blue steel which it concealed.&#xD;
"I'll make a subject of you, you rascally cockney," cried&#xD;
Rory, impetuously, "and dissect you afterwards with the great-&#xD;
est pleasure-come on!"&#xD;
The fellow, who was brandishing his knife very savagely, re-&#xD;
coiled. The idea suggested by O'Morra was unpalatable. Sup&#xD;
posing his life taken in a hasty fray, nothing more easy for a&#xD;
medical student than to dispose of the body, and the world be&#xD;
never the wiser. And the lad, like all boys, when his blood was&#xD;

up, was capable of anything, and the rest, recovering from their&#xD;
momentary alarm, looked on now very quietly while their young&#xD;
comrade, standing in a fencing position, handled his dangerous&#xD;
weapon with a facility that practice alone could give, and the&#xD;
point played ominously sure towards the most vital point of the&#xD;
body-snatcher's physique.&#xD;
" Who would have thought it !" cried Galenson, laughing.&#xD;
"Mr. Johnson-Mr. Johnson-be advised-put up your tool, or&#xD;
my friend O'Morra-the best fencer in New York and all at&#xD;
home in his anatomy-will prick your left ventricle and you'll&#xD;
be a dead man before you know it."&#xD;
"IHooray !" cried O'Callaghan, cutting a caper in his joy.&#xD;
"That's the blood of the O'Morras sure. The boy is no spooney&#xD;
for all, though he does dissect in gloves. Pink him, Rory !"&#xD;
Johnson, followed by O'Morra, had retreated to the wall, and&#xD;
then threw away his knife in abject submission.&#xD;
"The cowardly blackguard !" ejaculated O'Callaghan, at&#xD;
whose feet it fell, picking it up: "Why, see what a knife it is&#xD;
--a regular bowie-with an edge like a razor !-.Fenum habet in&#xD;
cornu-a dangerous villain ! No doubt but he was prepared to&#xD;
commit murder with this if necessary."&#xD;
Even Johnson's black accomplice broke out against him at&#xD;
this last proof of cowardice.&#xD;
" Sarve you right, you raskie, for goin' to stab de young gem-&#xD;
man-oh what a blunderbuss you be !"&#xD;
"Old your blasted tongue, you black pisoner !" returned the&#xD;
other with fury. "Speak hanother word an' I'll 'ave you&#xD;

"If de young gemman was to spit you like a fat rabbit, he be&#xD;
doin' a debblish good turn," retorted the negro. j" Wy don't&#xD;
you try to pacify de gemmen, you fool '? Dat's de way to git&#xD;
what you want."&#xD;
"Thee would do well to listen to his counsel," said Dr. Man-&#xD;
nikin, who had continued to be much agitated during this scene.&#xD;
Having been bred a Quaker, the worthy doctor spoke the&#xD;
plain language when excited,-as an angry Englishman drops his&#xD;
" h's" under similar circumstances.&#xD;
Johnbon himself, now composed in manner, but white with&#xD;
&#xD;
suppressed fury, changed his tone of voice from ferocious&#xD;
bluster to an artificial whine.&#xD;
" Gentlemen," said he, submissively, "I 'umbly beg pardon for&#xD;
my violence. Don't cheat me of my poor little adwantages&#xD;
hin this hunfortinate haffair !-Indeed, it's w'at I'm hentitled to,&#xD;

"Gib us de jewel, mas'r!" said the negro, insinuatingly ;&#xD;
" and keep de clo'se for to bury young missis w'en de doctors&#xD;
hab done wid her."&#xD;
" You won't hinjure nobody by so doin'; not a 'aypenny,"&#xD;
pursued Johnson, piteously. "The .fam'ly have throwed the&#xD;
things away, and the dead don't want 'em sartainly."&#xD;
"All your entreaties are useless, as much as your threats,"&#xD;
said young O'Morra, who stood by the burial-case with his wea-&#xD;
pon bared, and listening with an air half of heroism and half of&#xD;
contempt.--" You have been paid for the subject, my men--so&#xD;
be off, and thank your stars that for the felony you meditated&#xD;
you escape a prison."&#xD;
"Five years in a state-prison and a fine of one hundred dol-&#xD;
lars is he law," observed O'Callaghan :--" that's for opening any&#xD;
place of interment to remove the body for dissection, or to steal&#xD;
the clothes or anything else appertaining to the departed-see&#xD;
the Revised Statutes !"&#xD;
"Mr. O'Morra is right, after all," said the count, in his grave&#xD;
foreign manner. "We cannot make ourselves participes crim-&#xD;
mnis in this attempt at robbery. It is our duty to return these&#xD;
valuable articles to their owners."&#xD;
"Oh, not to the family, gentlemen-hanything but that !"&#xD;
exclaimed Johnson in an accent of real terror.&#xD;
"They can be returned through me, without compromising&#xD;
thee at all," said Dr. Mannikin, with his death's-head smile,&#xD;
and infinitely pallid.&#xD;

"Oh, yes," said the humbled villain, " that will do. Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin knows the fam'ly well. Doctor, I'm werry sorry---&#xD;
" No doubt! no doubt !" interrupted the doctor hastily-" of&#xD;
course you are sorry for what has occurred, Johnson. But thee&#xD;
bad better go now. I will see that a proper disposition is made&#xD;
of these articles without the slightest suspicion attaching to&#xD;
thee"-with emphasis, and hurrying him off&#xD;
"We'll go, doctor-come along, Jim-all right, I say, Jim.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin-a word with you below, hifyou please."&#xD;
O'Callaghan with some ceremony returned him the knife,&#xD;
which Johnson replaced carefully under his overcoat, and then&#xD;
paused a moment at the door---&#xD;
"I'll be heven with you for this some day, gents! An' as&#xD;
for you, young man !"-fixing a look of hate on O'Morra-" I&#xD;
shall know you hanother time-that's the 'ole of it."&#xD;
"All right !" said Rory, boyishly, putting up the sword-cane&#xD;
in its place.&#xD;
A little hubbub of congratulations greeted the shy youth,&#xD;
who only blushed. The count set the example of shaking hands&#xD;
with him.&#xD;
" Psha ! I am not a hero at all. Why you know I fainted in&#xD;
the theatre the other day at the amputation of a thumb."&#xD;
" I'faith, Rory," said O'Callaghan, laughing, "your stomach is&#xD;
'wake,' as the Irishman said, but your heart is as bold as a&#xD;
lion."&#xD;
" Now see here, fellows," observed Fitzfulke, " did you notice&#xD;
that old Mannikin followed those scoundrels down stairs ?&#xD;
While they are having a confab below, let us lock both doors on&#xD;
the learned doctor, and well not open them again till the auk:&#xD;
topsy is finished."&#xD;
-This was agreed to without a dissenting voice, the count deo-&#xD;
ciding to stay with the rest. The measure was hardly' put in&#xD;
execution before Dr. Mannikin returned from his conference&#xD;
and thundered for admission at the lower door ; but as the stu-&#xD;
dents paid no attention, the toxicologis, after docking vio-&#xD;
lently for some time and shouting himself hoarse, retired.&#xD;
Meanwhile the students and Galenson held a rapid consulta-&#xD;
tion. O'Callaghan brought from a drawer a coarse clean sheet,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MARBLE BRIDE.                   85&#xD;
which he spread upon the table under the burial-case, while the&#xD;
latter was raised for that purpose by his companions. O'Cal-&#xD;
laghan, though not holding like Dr. Galensonan official position,&#xD;
being an undergraduate, yet from his advanced standing and&#xD;
general proficiency as a student, acted, as we have se  a&#xD;
sort of aid to their preceptor. The   oun e     sen, as a&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
GALENSON'S LECTURE--THE AUTOPSY.&#xD;
"THIs young person is reported to have died suddenly," said&#xD;
Galenson, with a gravity becoming the first clinical lecturer of&#xD;
the day, and which contrasted strongly with his usual sardonic&#xD;
levity. "She is reported to have died suddenly, in the midst of&#xD;
a nuptial festivity, of which the interest was concentred in her,&#xD;
and yet there has been no post-mortem. You will ask me how&#xD;
I know this without removing the garments, and in the absence&#xD;
of positive testimony. I answer that a post-mortem could not&#xD;
take place without decomposition of the exposed tissues and&#xD;
fluids, a decomposition which on opening the coffin eight days&#xD;
after death would at once be apparent to the senses. Now when&#xD;
the upper shell of this case was removed some moments ago,&#xD;
there was a slight fragrance, as of some delicate perfume im-&#xD;
pregnating the apparel of the deceased, and that was all. More-&#xD;
over, on the exposed portions of the body we do not discover&#xD;
the faintest discoloration. The surface is blanched, but spotless&#xD;
as a snow-drift. All this is very remarkable, especially as the&#xD;
only positive unequivocal sign of death, is, as you know, the&#xD;
commencement of decomposition: and the absence thus far of&#xD;
this sign imposes on us the necessity of proceeding with the&#xD;
utmost caution."&#xD;
There was a slight murmur of approbation from the students.&#xD;
"There is no negative sign of death which may not be sim-&#xD;
ulated," continued Galenson :-"pulsation, respiration, sensibili-&#xD;
ty, consciousness, may be entirely suspended even .for many&#xD;
days, as happens sometimes in trance, or for a briefer period by&#xD;
the agency of electricity, from suffocation in drowning, and per-&#xD;
haps from other causes. But as long as a cause is present which&#xD;
arrests the chemical law that incessantly tends to decompose all&#xD;
organic matters, whether animal or vegetable, so long there is&#xD;
&#xD;
GALENSON'S LECTURE---.THE AUTOPSY.         37&#xD;
life, and the functions, though suspended, may be restored.&#xD;
Hence, if the medical men in attendance, whoever they were,&#xD;
permitted this body to be interred before they had ascertained&#xD;
positively the commencement of decomposition somewhere they&#xD;
were guilty of the grossest and most criminal negligence. And&#xD;
yet, not only has no post-mortem taken place-certainly not--&#xD;
but, unless I am greatly deceived, the body has not even been&#xD;
undressed. I have had some experience in mortuary matters,&#xD;
gentlemen, and I do not believe it would be possible to dress a&#xD;
corpse with such faultless nicety."&#xD;
"I think not," observed Count Wissen. "In fact, if one&#xD;
could suppose this lady alive, she might step right into a ball-&#xD;
room in that finished toilette, without stopping to adjust a&#xD;
flower or a ribbon."&#xD;
"I am glad to be confirmed in my opinion by an authority&#xD;
so unexceptionable. Here, then, we are confronted on the very&#xD;
threshold of our inquiry, gentlemen, with mysterious facts&#xD;
which impose upon us the utmost delicacy of attention, extend-&#xD;
ing to the minutest circumstances. Nor does the mystery&#xD;
cease here :-for even the costly personal ornaments of the de-&#xD;
ceased have not been removed, a fact almost inconceivable, but&#xD;
which we have no reason to regret : for scarcely has the body&#xD;
been interred when a cupidity that ought to have been foreseen&#xD;
has caused it to be exhumed for the evident purpose of plunder.&#xD;
By what means the parties to this outrage succeeded in de-&#xD;
feating the precau ions by which our principal cemetery is&#xD;
guarded from violation, does not appear. Their bringing the&#xD;
body hero; after they had managed to carry it off, is easily ac-&#xD;
counted for by the difficulty in disposing of it otherwise, and by&#xD;
their expectation that in this place all trace of their crime&#xD;
would speedily disappear. Had not Mr. Hartley been absent,&#xD;
or had we not availed ourselves of his absence to prolong our&#xD;
labors beyond the usual hour of locking up, this scheme would&#xD;
probably have succeeded. I agree with my young friend&#xD;
O'Morra that it becomes us to treat these remains, the object of&#xD;
so much tenderness to the survivors, with all imaginable res-&#xD;
pect, and to return them, if possible, unmutilated to their&#xD;
original resting place ; but at the same time it is our duty to&#xD;

GALENSON9S LECTURE-THEj AUTOPSY.&#xD;
&#xD;
seize the opportunity providentially afforded us, of elucidating&#xD;
the mystery and perhaps of bringing to light a crime.-&#xD;
" That's the way to talk," said Fitzfulke, caressing a mus-&#xD;
tache that curled over his protuberant upper lip-for he had&#xD;
ceased smoking.&#xD;
"I don't object to an investigation," said O'Morra.&#xD;
"It is our duty," said O'Callaghan.  -&#xD;
" We all agree to it, doctor," said the count.&#xD;
Young O'Morra, at Galenson's request, quietly untied the rib-&#xD;
bon which confined the two wrists together, and the arms&#xD;
dropped lifeless at the side. There was a print of the ribbon&#xD;
on the back of each wrist, but no discoloration. Then at a sign&#xD;
from Galenson, O'Morra removed the large artificial bouquet of&#xD;
white jessamine-so exquisitely wrought by French hands that&#xD;
you might have taken it for the natural flowers-from the bosom&#xD;
of the dress, and detached the chain of pearl brooches which so&#xD;
magnificently fastened its antiquely fashioned corsage or jacket,&#xD;
reviving a picturesque and stately costume of the middle ages,&#xD;
often seen in old illuminated books. But here the youth's labor&#xD;
-       was abridged, for beneath this rich exterior garment was noth-&#xD;
ing but a loose and singularly simple dress of almost snow-white&#xD;
woollen, undulating over the bosom as if a sculptor had modelled&#xD;
it in marble, and in the folds of which lay a large gold medal&#xD;
hung in a white ribbon.&#xD;
" She was a Catholic !" whispered O'Callaghan.&#xD;
The other young men were, so to speak, doubly silent. O'Morra&#xD;
looked up as if to-ask what next, and Galenson waved his hand&#xD;
to indicate that nothing further was yet necessary.&#xD;
"Before we proceed to seek the one positive sign of death,"&#xD;
continued the latter, resuming the deep monotone of his cli-&#xD;
nique, "let us ascertain if the positive signs of life are absent.&#xD;
Is there any pulse 7"&#xD;
The young physician once more applied his fingers first to&#xD;
one wrist, then to the other. No sign of life there at all events.&#xD;
He touched the carotid, or great artery of the throat, which&#xD;
supplied the seat of intelligence with the aliment of vitality.&#xD;
Galenson's heavy lips parted, and his massive face assumed an&#xD;
expression of almost ludicrous solemnity.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Mr. O'Morra," said he at last in a low voice, "please to lay&#xD;
your hand on the heart of the subject."&#xD;
Some moments elapsed. The white and shapely hand of the&#xD;
young sculptor, softly laid upon the deceased, over the woollen&#xD;
robe, drew all eyes. A blush came and went on his girl-like&#xD;
cheek. At length he slowly withdrew his hand, and looked up&#xD;
rather pale and evidently excited.&#xD;
" Well?" said Galenson.&#xD;
" I perceive no pulsation, Dr. Galenson, but there is warmth."&#xD;
" Warmth without pulsation signifies nothing," returned Ga-&#xD;
lenson, with disappointment. "Yet he said 'warmth,' and 'in&#xD;
the region of the heart.'" He mused, then drew forth from his&#xD;
pocket a small cedar stethoscope. "Heat," he added, looking&#xD;
round the class, "is a chemical phenomenon, not a vital one."&#xD;
Galenson applied his instrument, as young O'Morra had ap-&#xD;
plied his hand, over the under-dress, and his ear to the instru-&#xD;
ment. Motionless, still, Ly the body in its glistering robe and&#xD;
starry veil. The perfect features remained in their unutterable&#xD;
tranquillity-their blanched and fixed repose. The anxiety of&#xD;
the students was now evidently at its highest pitch, but mingled&#xD;
with confidence: for Galenson was reputed one of the best aus-&#xD;
cultators in the city. His ear was infallible. Long and pa-&#xD;
tiently he listened. Strange expressions flitted over his grand&#xD;
scientific face, as if he had been a master of music listening to&#xD;
a melody inaudible to the rest of mankind. At last he with-&#xD;
drew his ear from the almost intelligent instrument, and re-&#xD;
moving the latter from the side, where it left a distinguishable&#xD;
impress en on the soft and snowy woollen, said in a low voice&#xD;
but deliberate and emphatic-.&#xD;

VARIOUS PROPOSITIONS.        41&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
"If this be sleep, how soft ! if death, bow fair!&#xD;
Much have my books disclosed, but the end inceof the Water Lily&#xD;
" ALIVE ! Impossible !"&#xD;
"The heart beats at all events !" said Galenson.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the ~faintest suspicion of the truth possibly&#xD;
entertained by all, every one was immeasurably astonished by&#xD;
the actual announcement.&#xD;
" During the whole time that I listened at the heart," said&#xD;
Galenson, "there were but two beats-the first so faint that I&#xD;
thought I might be mistaken ; the second was unequivocal."&#xD;
Meanwhile no time was lost in administering appropriate&#xD;
remedies. The skill and resources of the operators were too&#xD;
great to admit a doubt of the ultimate result, yet an hour passed&#xD;
before there was any perceptible sign of success. What a&#xD;
moment of triumph when a small mirror held before the lips&#xD;
became dim! A sigh-a convulsion-respiration re-establishing&#xD;
itself with laborious effort ! The limbs shudder as in epilepsy,&#xD;
the eyes open, but the balls roll masterless. Even Galenson&#xD;
was deeply agitated. Gradually this paroxysm passed off, the&#xD;
eye softened, became intelligent and expressive, consciousness&#xD;
had returned--the maiden sprang up, gazed wildly round her,&#xD;
screamed with a look full of terror, and sank slowly back in a&#xD;
swoon.&#xD;
"We must remove her instantly from this horrible place," said&#xD;
O'Morra.&#xD;
"Of course !" hissed Fitzfulke. "It is enough to frighten any&#xD;
young woman to death, to find herself here." .&#xD;
There were as many plans as persons. The count suggested&#xD;
a hotel. O'Callaghan recommended the Sisters' Hospital, which&#xD;
was not many streets distant.&#xD;
&#xD;
Galenson, being visiting physician of the City Hospital, pro-&#xD;
posed taking her directly there, anticipating perhaps glorious&#xD;
opportunities of observation and clinique. Fitzfulke con-&#xD;
founded all hospitals right and left, as utterly unsuitable places&#xD;
for a young lady of good family, and advised that she should&#xD;
be taken home at once, forgetting that they were all ignorant of&#xD;
her family name.&#xD;
The.hotel proposition was ruled out, considering the difficulty of&#xD;
obtaining admission and suitable accommodation for an unknown&#xD;
stranger in a dying condition, the defective attendance, and&#xD;
absence of suitable female care ; and while Fitzfulke went to&#xD;
call a carriage and Galenson and O'Callaghan disputed on the&#xD;
rival claims of their hospitals, O'Morra made a suggestion dif-&#xD;
ferent from all the rest and which at first gained no favor.&#xD;
It was to convey the lady to his own boarding-house on&#xD;
Brooklyn heights, a quiet, respectable place, where she would&#xD;
have pure air and every comfort of a private family.&#xD;
"Too far !" said Galenson, decidedly. "The girl is hardly&#xD;
-fit to be moved at all."&#xD;
"If we find that it is too much for her, we can stop at the&#xD;
City Hospital-it is on the way," said the adroit O'Morra.&#xD;
"That's true," said Galenson-" well I think yours a very&#xD;
good idea, O'Mor'ra."&#xD;
"But can she be accommodated '?" asked the count, who&#xD;
was O'Morra's fellow-boarder. "Is there a vacant room, Mr.&#xD;
Rory'?"&#xD;
"I will vacate mine-I can sleep on the sofa in the governor's&#xD;
park r," said Rory.&#xD;
" You're a' trump, Rory !" said Galenson.&#xD;
"MIr., Rory has excellent inspirations," said the count.-" I&#xD;
find that next best to a hotel--but I fear the distance."&#xD;
"There are first-class hotels the whole way," said Rory, "if&#xD;
she is found not to bear it."&#xD;
"The Sisters of Charity are the best nurses in the world, and&#xD;
close at hand," insisted O'Callaghan:--" what will you gain by&#xD;
carrying her all the way to Brooklyn '"&#xD;
"The air is so pure, and the neighborhood so quiet," said&#xD;
&#xD;

Rory ; "and then Miss Tankerville--who is a Catholic too-will&#xD;
take such excellent care&#xD;
"Ah! Miss Tankerville will take such excellent care !"&#xD;
repeated the count, laughing.s&#xD;
If it is a Catholic family, I withdrawv my objections," said&#xD;
O'Callaghan: "but at the city hospital they would let her die&#xD;
without a priest-that's why !"c.d..&#xD;
Fitzfulke returned with the carriage to find the point decided&#xD;
in favor of O'Morra's proposition. Shy and sly O'Morra ! With&#xD;
all his innocence he contrives to wind them all round his little&#xD;
finger.&#xD;
"Fellows," said Fitzfulke, "how do you think I found ,a&#xD;
carriage so quick at this time of night ? Why, there's a thun-&#xD;
dering big party in the next block, and the street is chock full&#xD;
of carriages. I hired a fellow with a long six-seat rockaway,&#xD;
who was waiting to take his chance. -And who do you think I&#xD;
saw on the box of a grand family coach drawn up in line ? Who&#xD;
but our friend Johnson, swearing at his horses as if all the&#xD;
fiends from below were inside of him !"&#xD;
The lower shell of the burial case served as a litter for their&#xD;
patient, the silver handles made, it very convenient, and four&#xD;
of the young men carried it without the slightest difficulty down&#xD;
the broad stair of the college. Galenson pointed out the pru-&#xD;
dence of removing the upper shell at the same time.&#xD;
"Should the disappearance of this young person's remains,"&#xD;
he observed, "be discovered, and it should get rumored abroad&#xD;
that a part of the burial-case had been seen in the college, the&#xD;
mob would. tear down the building."&#xD;
Appreciating this reflection, while the insensible girl was&#xD;
placed without difficulty in the roomy carriage, the litter lying&#xD;
diagonally across. so that the head and foot were supported on&#xD;
the low elbow cushions, by the Count and O'Morra, O'Callaghan&#xD;
enveloped the upper shell in the sheet before mentioned, and&#xD;
got on the front or driver's seat with it.&#xD;
"Is that a boat now, or a bath-tub ?" asked the driver.&#xD;
"It is old Charon's life-boat," answered the witty Irishman.&#xD;
"Sure it's shaped like a boat," said the unsuspicious jarvey ;&#xD;
" but isn't it too small to float any size of man at all '"&#xD;
&#xD;
A SHADOWY AFFAIR.                   43&#xD;
" Why, look you-it has saved the life of the young woman&#xD;
inside this very night !" said O'Callaghan.&#xD;
"Is that a fact? Well, now ! An' where will I drive you,&#xD;
bos ?"&#xD;
"To the Wall street ferry, as fast as you can."&#xD;
As the rockaway turned the corner swiftly, to go down&#xD;
town, a superb equipage from the big party dashed by, and&#xD;
O'Callaghan, twisting round, cried out to the party inside,.......&#xD;
"Boys! there goes that rascally Johnson, and if that sly old&#xD;
Mannikin isn't inside, drab cloak and, all!I-what do you think&#xD;
of that?"&#xD;
The count hummed a military air.&#xD;
Dr. Galenson took the opportunity to impress upon his com-&#xD;
panions inside the importance and necessity of an inviolable&#xD;
secrecy in regard to all that had occurred. He pointed out that&#xD;
the safety as well as honor of a medical institution were involved&#xD;
in this sort of discretion.--&#xD;
"The justice of the doctor's remarks is obvious," said the&#xD;
count. Unless I ani deceived, gentlemen, we have here a&#xD;
shadowy affair, and we ought to be on our guard."&#xD;
"Above all," said Galenson, "if any of us chance. to&#xD;
meet Dr. Mannikin, not a syllable to hm of this surprising re-&#xD;
suscitation-- do you understand ?"&#xD;
"Miss Tankerville is Dr. Mannikin's cousin," remarked,&#xD;
O'Morra, but as they don't speak, that makes no difference."&#xD;
All arranges itself marvellously," said the count.&#xD;
"Will not the doctor ask about the jewels 2'' inquired&#xD;
O'tMorra1 as a lamp flashed in upon the necklace and bracelet&#xD;
of their insensible charge.&#xD;
"Refer him to me--I can stop his questions," said Dr&#xD;
Galenson.                             usins"si        r&#xD;
"Now see here, fellows," cried Fitzfulke, as if a sudden light&#xD;
hadetroken upon him: "do you know I think Mannikin had&#xD;
something to do with this girl's being buried alive? What in&#xD;
ther did he come marching up into the dissecting-room, to&#xD;
see old Hartley for, at that time o' night? lHe's not such an&#xD;
 lenthusia  o the subject of anatomy, that ever I heard&#xD;
of I"&#xD;

MISS TANKERVILLL-&#xD;
&#xD;
"You're a lucky fellow at finding mare's nests, Fitz," said&#xD;
Galenson.&#xD;
The carriage glided smoothly and rapidly down the deserted&#xD;
and well-paved thoroughfare. A light fall of snow rendered the&#xD;
passage still more smooth and silent. Galenson, who jealously&#xD;
watched his patient's pulse, perceived that so far from suffering&#xD;
by the removal, she was like to benefit by it. At night, when&#xD;
the glare of the shop windows has entirely disappeared, when&#xD;
the carriage-way is deserted even by the omnibuses, and the&#xD;
side-walks offer only an occasional straggler of the male sex,&#xD;
and the masses of the buildings, many-storied and vast, their&#xD;
architecture lost in the gloom, show only a black outline against&#xD;
the sky, or glitter else in the moonlight with their piles of white.&#xD;
marble,-Broadway is poetical. Galenson sighed as they'passed&#xD;
the hospital, but he could make no excuse for stopping. In-.&#xD;
deed, when the lamps of the ferry-house shone into the carriage,&#xD;
and the horses' hoofs resounded over the swing-bridge, O'Morra-&#xD;
became aware that his burthen was a conscious one. True, the&#xD;
form lay motionless in its narrow and unyielding bed, but a&#xD;
pair of extraordinary large dark eyes looked up at him. The&#xD;
air was sharp on the river, which was full of floating ice, and&#xD;
the great moon looked do .vn upon it in all her wintry splendor.&#xD;
The large dark eyes turned towards the brilliant scene.&#xD;
"Those bloody scoundrels must have brought her from Green-&#xD;
wood just as you are carrying her now," observed Fitzfulke;&#xD;
"for she is too tall to lie out straight any other way in the big-&#xD;
gest carriage, and these confounded cases won't bend, no how&#xD;
you can fix it."&#xD;
"Five feet and six inches, I judge, may be the height of ma-&#xD;
demoiselle," observed the military Wissen ; "which is a fair&#xD;
height for a woman."&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said Galenson, "our patient's pulse indicates&#xD;
that reaction is setting in pretty strongly."&#xD;
The boat sped across the illuminated river, crashed through a&#xD;
drift of ice, then swept with the usual superb mastery for which&#xD;
the New York ferry-boats are unrivalled in the world, into her&#xD;
berth on the Brooklyn side. The slight concussion as she hit&#xD;
the bridge, and start of the horses, elicited inside the carriage&#xD;
&#xD;
a faint feminine exclamation that thrilled every heart-the more&#xD;
as it was succeeded by perfect silence.&#xD;
The carriage rolled up the steep ascent of Montague street&#xD;
and gained the heights. Guided by O'Callaghan, who knew&#xD;
the house, it rolled presently into a court-yard and drew up be-&#xD;
fore the door of a somewhat imposing mansion standing in the&#xD;
midst of a garden, and overlooking the magnificent bay.&#xD;
O'Morra's night-key procured instant admission, and without&#xD;
any, delay the form of the "lately-decease"...-5  O'Callaghan&#xD;
wittily termed her--was conveyed to, his room.. At the first&#xD;
effort to remove her from the carriage the maiden murmured&#xD;
something, and put one sandaled foot, one jewelled arm, outside&#xD;
her hard litter; but as the young men bore her on, taking no&#xD;
notice, resigned herself "passive to all changes."&#xD;
The reader will please to imagine the astonishment of a Miss&#xD;
Tankerville--the name itself breathes of maiden respectabilit-.&#xD;
mistress of a highly respectable, more than respectable board-&#xD;
ing-house on Brooklyn heights-elevated position if there is one&#xD;
n this world !-on being waked from her first sleep in the small&#xD;
hours of the night, by a young medical student (or artist rather)&#xD;
one of her boarders, announcing.-&#xD;
"Miss Tankerville ! I want you, if you please! There's a&#xD;
young lady in my room."&#xD;
Astonishment is too feeble a word !&#xD;
"A young lady in your room! ,Goodness, Mr. Forrester!&#xD;
ow dared you, sir"? And what puts it in your head to come&#xD;
tell me of it, if you dared ?"---The door is hardly ajar.&#xD;
"It is not Forrester--it is O'Morra !"&#xD;
"Goodness, Mr. O'Morra !" cries the lady--opening the door&#xD;
considerably wider. "I thought, to be sure, it was that horrid&#xD;
BillForse-tiwaththrd&#xD;
Forrester-it would have been just like him. A youn&#xD;
y in your room! did I hear you right, Mr. Rory'?"&#xD;
"It is a dreadful mystery, my dear Miss Tankerville-- p&#xD;
the greatest confidence in you, you know  We  a-W yput&#xD;
undress her and put her to bed."&#xD;
Is he tight, I wonder'?" exclaimed the bewildered spinster,&#xD;
"We have saved her life-do you understand'? That is, Dr.&#xD;

thr Tankerville was an energetic and sensible person-other-&#xD;
. -  probable, she would not have conducted a large and&#xD;
uccesfu boardinghousein so prominent a situation as Brook-&#xD;
lyn heights. She soon entered young O' Morra's room, accom-&#xD;
panied by an Irish maiden bearing clean sheets, pillow-cases,&#xD;
an   e    articles suitable to the emergency. The stranger,&#xD;
ain   no nrio s e or  apparently  so, lay  on  the  sofa, "diffused&#xD;

" Goodness !" cried Miss Tankervile-"the young lady has&#xD;
been taken ill at a ball! Who is she, doctor ? My goodness !&#xD;
what a lovely dress !"&#xD;
It was of importance to conciliate Miss Tankervilleso&#xD;
interest and at the same time engage her secrecy. Dr. Galenson&#xD;
peered at her sagaciously over his gold-rimmed spectacles,&#xD;
which gave him, though a young man, an appearance of won&#xD;
derful gravity.&#xD;
" Miss Tankerville," said he,  wehv    toutpre,&#xD;
Count Wissen and myself, to confide to your well-known discre-&#xD;
tion a case that requires a great deal of that quality. At pre-&#xD;
sent,a ce tservethis youngperson can give no account of&#xD;
herself, and we can give no account of her, except that her&#xD;
name is Rose-Rose Marie---is it not, count ? Marie is perhaps&#xD;
a surname."&#xD;
"Marie, perhaps-I know a°family of that name," said Miss&#xD;
Tankei Vyule.&#xD;
"eryvlikely-very likely : Americans often omit the accent&#xD;
of the French '6;' and we know the name only by-her&#xD;
card."&#xD;
"Exactly-I understand, doctor," said Miss Tankervile.&#xD;
"She was taken ill at Mrs. Oleander's party, I suppose, count ?"&#xD;
-glancing at that gentleman's evening costume, of which we&#xD;
have already spoken.&#xD;
&#xD;
"At least I can assure you that she is a young lady of unex..&#xD;
ceptionahe character and connections," said the count&#xD;
ntly" said Miss Tankerville, who hardly took h&#xD;
off the superb dress of the stranger-o"hA bride  t  er eyes&#xD;
course! Well! shall I take charge of Miss            '&#xD;

"Miss Tankerville, you are an angel !" said th&#xD;

The young person thus wonderfully recovered from death&#xD;
was, indeed, now in safe and unexceptionable hands. Io&#xD;
remained to dispose of the burial-casetiche Misanktonly&#xD;
had not seen. When Galenson O'    ra and thMiss Tankerville&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE CONSULTATION.&#xD;
THERE'S many a slip  -.  The life of the mysterious stranger&#xD;
began to be in danger from the moment it seemed to be saved.&#xD;
It was evident from the first that her mode of existence was&#xD;
still unnatural. Consciousness was restored, muscular power&#xD;
was not wanting, yet certain functions appeared to be suspended.&#xD;
astrantgr could seak,she had uttered on several occasions&#xD;
The strange oud  sp e      d   but days and days passed&#xD;
articulate sr pronouncing a single sentence, or answering a single&#xD;
question that was put to her. She would take no solid food,&#xD;
n erytseldom and sparingly that which Miss Tankerville pre-&#xD;
aed fver sd  liquid form. During the twenty-four hours&#xD;
sfherly slt lmdore than two-usually a little after dawn.&#xD;
she scarcely slept moethntw     attendant approached the&#xD;
At whatever hour of the night her atnatapoce          h&#xD;
couch, with whatever precaution "Rose Marie" lay, quietly,&#xD;
wth, with gratevrck eyes open, and her hands either crossed on&#xD;
with her great black eysoe, a   sdo    he bed. She never&#xD;
her breast, or extended on the outside of t&#xD;
turned, and scarcely stirred, by day or night.&#xD;
After a few days, a low fever supervened: yet the only sign&#xD;
of restlessness was a frequent low moa  incessant motion of&#xD;
liriun, tossing of the arms, quick restless inces ; mot  of&#xD;
the eyes, picking of the bed-clothes, at last low words; but the&#xD;
last conveyed no information--she seemed to have a black-board&#xD;
before her, from which she recited the steps of  rpexed&#xD;
matical demonstrations. Dr. Galenson was sovereignty perplexed.&#xD;
He had administered various remedies Apoite tunof such-&#xD;
symptoms, but they were mostly rejected. After a run of twen-&#xD;
ty-four days, the fever totally disappeared. The patient fell&#xD;
into a profound sleep, accompanied with profuse swas by this&#xD;
persisted in refusing neryalnors      ethwsbyhi&#xD;
&#xD;
time reduced from the appearance of the highest youthful vigor&#xD;
to the last degree of emaciation and feebleness ; and yet, the&#xD;
intellectual activity seemed restored in some degree, for she&#xD;
spoke to Miss Tankerville, and replied to the doctor s unfailing&#xD;
daily questions, though briefly, almost in monosyllables.&#xD;
"We shall not save her after all, doctor," said Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville, in a pathetic tone of voice.&#xD;
"There is no disease, madam. With careful nursing, sho&#xD;
ought now to recover."&#xD;
"She is sinking," replied Miss Tankerville, with a stifled sob.&#xD;
"I have seen a great change in her during the last three days.&#xD;
She herself thinks she is dying, for she asked me to send for a&#xD;
priest."&#xD;
"Everything has been done for her that science can," return-&#xD;
ed the young physician, folding his arms gloomily.&#xD;
"Doctor, you will excuse me, but it is my opinion that there&#xD;
ought to be a consultation. I will bear the expense,",said the&#xD;
lady, in a firm tone.&#xD;
" Madam, do you suppose that I. should not have proposed&#xD;
the same thing long ago, had I not been profoundly convinced&#xD;
of its absolute inutility ? There is but one physician in New&#xD;
York on whom it would be ofgny earthly use to call for advice&#xD;
in this case.. Our patient, madam, has been poisoned, and we&#xD;
need an antidote."&#xD;
A brief silence followed, broken by Miss Tankerville.&#xD;
"Doctor, you are aware that my cousin, Dr. Mannikin, is no&#xD;
friend or favorite of mine-I never thought to see him cross my&#xD;
threshold again-as I told you the other day.-but, if Miss Mari6&#xD;
has been poisoned- "&#xD;
"His skill in such cases is altogether unrivalled," said Galen-&#xD;
s'on, eagerly.&#xD;
"Exactly so.&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin could save this girl's life, if he,.would."&#xD;
"Then by all means call him in-for if she istleft alone, she&#xD;
dies, doctor !" said Miss Tankerville, energetically,&#xD;
This conversation took place in Miss Tankerville's parlor&#xD;
after Dr. Galenson's morning visit: for he always came twice a&#xD;
day. At a late hour the same afternoon the two physicians,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6853-00000027"/>&#xD;
50                     ROSEMARY.&#xD;
each in his own carriage, met at the ferry, and crossing the&#xD;
river together, drove separately to Miss Tankerville's door, Dr.&#xD;
Galenson leading the way in his uggy, and Dr Mauiin fol-&#xD;
lowing in his handsome chariot. The latter jumped out and&#xD;
advanced to his brother physician with an air of surprise.&#xD;
"This is Miss Tankerville's, doctor! Thee-never told me&#xD;
that thy patient was here."&#xD;
"I was not aware that the name of the lady with whom my&#xD;
patient is a boarder, had anything to do with her case. doctor."&#xD;
"Oh, no! certainly :-Miss Tankerville and I are not on good&#xD;
terms-that's all."&#xD;
"Indeed !" said Galenson, with well-acted surprise. "Why,&#xD;
it was Miss Tankerville herself who proposed sending for you."&#xD;
" So 'I" replied Dr. Mannikin, appearing much relieved.&#xD;
"Well, that alters the case."&#xD;
Miss Tankerville's house had been built by a rich merchant&#xD;
for his own residence. Too large for any private family of or-&#xD;
dinary fortune, it had followed the usual fate of similar man-&#xD;
sions in our shifting society, by becoming a boarding-house.&#xD;
Around it still extended the old gardens and pleasaunce, planted&#xD;
with venerable trees. The situation was unrivalled. Towards&#xD;
the west the view was open to the bay, with its forts, the un-&#xD;
counted shipping, the busy s eaboats plying in all directions,&#xD;
the point of New York island juting out betwixt the North and&#xD;
East rivers, and in the distance the blue Jersey shore.&#xD;
The old drawing-room into which the two doctors were shown&#xD;
for a moment, ws of ample size, lofty, and handsomely furnish-&#xD;
ed in a style that NgJl suited it, equally removed from the mea-&#xD;
greness of the inferior, and the vulgar splendor oV the.fashion-&#xD;
able class of boarding-houses. There were great plenty of cosy&#xD;
seats, chiefly old-fashioned arm-chairs, a ladies' work-table that&#xD;
seemed in use, and a thousand domestic elegancies indicative of&#xD;
a refined taste ; the walls were hung with numerous pictures,&#xD;
and a great piano stood open with music on it, as if the perform-&#xD;
er had just left it. The windows, richly and heavily draped,&#xD;
commanded the fine view I have described.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin's keen and stealthy eye noted every feature, not&#xD;
without surprise: "Medallion carpet--silk curtains-rosewood&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CONSULTATION.            51&#xD;
&#xD;
furniture-pictures! Where did she get all this ?" murmured&#xD;
he, with a very unquaker-like expletive, that sounded much like&#xD;
an oath. "So you say you suspect the young person has taken&#xD;
poison, doctor ?"&#xD;
"I do not suspect she has taken it, but that it has been ad-&#xD;
ministered to her, doctor."&#xD;
"Au ! important difference ! In the former case, the nervous&#xD;
depression you describe might be attributed to a moral cause-&#xD;
consequently beyond the reach of our art."&#xD;
"Nothing of that sort, doctor ! Miss Tankerville assures me&#xD;
that during her patient's delirium she has talked of the most&#xD;
innocent school-girl trifles-sines and Cosines and algebraic&#xD;
formulas-how you start, doctor ?"&#xD;
"Humph! the oddity of a girl's delirium taking a mathematical&#xD;
turn !" replied Dr. Mannikin, with difficulty recovering his com-&#xD;
posure.&#xD;
"It merely shows that she has nothing on her mind more&#xD;
serious than her lessons."&#xD;
" Th-ee---you told me, doctor,--that you made a post-mortem&#xD;
of the young lady who was brought to the college-one night&#xD;
when I happened in-a month or six weeks ago."&#xD;
"Certainly, doctor."&#xD;
" Ah ! you discovered that she died of disease of the heart-.&#xD;
I think ?"&#xD;
"I doubt if I was so positive-I said we began with the heart,&#xD;
and found enough to render further examination useless."&#xD;
" Ah !-you kept the heart,' you said ?"&#xD;
" And promised to show it you--didn't I?" grimly smiling.&#xD;
"I should like to see it," said Dr. Mannikin, in a more assured&#xD;
and natural tone of voice. "And so you never discovered the&#xD;
young person's family name ?"&#xD;
"I thought it indiscreet to make inquiries-and you recollect&#xD;
doctor,'that you yourself declined to gratify my curiosity."&#xD;
" Under the circumstances-I too thought it indiscreet,"&#xD;
replied the toxicologist.,&#xD;
Here a servant announced that the doctor might come&#xD;
upstairs. The hall and staircase were of old fashioned spacious-&#xD;
ness; a window on the first landing-place overlooked a sort of&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6853-00000028"/>&#xD;
avenue in the pleasaunce, beyond which were seen the brown&#xD;
buttresses of a gothic church. Dr. Mannikin remarked on the&#xD;
cheerfulness of this view. The forms of the architecture were&#xD;
rendered more distinct by snow, and the whole was gilded by&#xD;
the sunset.&#xD;
The sick-room was on the second story: its windows, like&#xD;
those of the drawing-room, overlooked the bay. It was afiue&#xD;
large room, as all in the house appeared to be. The high&#xD;
mahogany head-board of the bed was against the windows and&#xD;
cut off the light from the patient, who was hardly discernible as&#xD;
she lay, her face buried in the pillows and shaded by the ruffles&#xD;
of a cap a world too wide for her.  Miss Tankerville'n ta'l&#xD;
figure, in an amply spreading dress, was also standing at the&#xD;
bed's head, and threw a deeper shadow over the patient.&#xD;
Chairs were placed for the two physicians, to whom Miss Tan-&#xD;
kerville bowed with great formality, but with no sign of recog-&#xD;
nition to her cousin.&#xD;
"Since you were here in the morning, Miss Marie has again&#xD;
desired me to send for a clergyman, sir," observed Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville.&#xD;
"A clergyman !" said Galensoniwith a, look of sagacious con-&#xD;
tempt.   Of what use can he be '.-.&#xD;
"Of the greatest, doctor, in her opinion, since she is persuaded&#xD;
that she is dying."&#xD;
"We must all die sooner or later. Our young friend here&#xD;
will live many years yet oIhope. ri&#xD;
She did not look like it. Fever and fasting had sadly ravaged&#xD;
the beauty which death or apparent death, had spared. The&#xD;
once rich and full-outlined features were now sharp, pinched&#xD;
and almost translucent. The black hair had escaped from the&#xD;
ca and strayed in loose disorder upon the night-dress, over the&#xD;
shoulder and bosom, wasted and sunken.&#xD;
"The pulse, doctor," said Galenson, touching it, "is quite&#xD;
peculiar."&#xD;
Dr.p Mannikin, whose medical intuition had surveyed the&#xD;
patient from head to foot, noting her position and what he could&#xD;
discern of her expression, now applied his long white fingers to&#xD;
the transparent wrist that lay motionless on the counterpane.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CONSULTATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
"The stroke is firm, but surprisingly infrequent," pursued&#xD;
Galenson.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin seemed greatly surprised. He drew forth his&#xD;
watch, still keeping his finger tips on the wrist. His face was&#xD;
turned to the light-astonishment was depicted on it.&#xD;
"This is the pulse," said he, as if involuntarily, "of a person&#xD;
who has taken upas ar----"&#xD;
The lightning is not more sudden than the electric start with&#xD;
which the patient, at the sound of his voice, roused at once&#xD;
- from her lethargy, sprang to her seat in the bed, put away the&#xD;
ruffles from her eyes with one emaciated hand and gazed in his&#xD;
face.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin recoiled in his chair, and returned her gaze&#xD;
with a ghastly grin of terror.&#xD;
"Ezekiel Mannikin !" gasped the young woman.&#xD;
"RoSE-MA-Ry 1" stammered the physician. "Do I see you&#xD;
alive "&#xD;
The young .girl sank back upon the pillow, exhausted with&#xD;
her effort: her large wild eyes, hollow, dark and piercing, still&#xD;
regarded him.&#xD;
"I do-not--.ask you-to save me," she panted. "It isper-&#xD;
haps too late-even for you."&#xD;
"I shall do all I can, my dear child, believe me. But for the&#xD;
treason of others it had never come to this."&#xD;
This assurance, given with great apparent sincerity, elicited&#xD;
only a faint derisive smile. -The young girl then quietly turned&#xD;
away her piercing glance, and murmuring:--" Man proposes,&#xD;
God disposes"-seemed to siqk, wearied, into the mysterious&#xD;
apathy but of which she had been so painfully startled.&#xD;
Miss Tankerville, who had at first regarded this scene with a&#xD;
wild stare, now turned up the gas already feebly burning beside&#xD;
the dressing-bureau, and 'fixed on Dr. Mannikin a look of&#xD;
searching and stern interrogatory. That gentleman winced&#xD;
rose, and said to his brother physician--" I think we may now&#xD;
withdraw, doctor V'by&#xD;
"As you please, doctor," said Galenson, drily.&#xD;
Miss Tankerville's drawing room was filled with the boarders,&#xD;
assembled for dinner. Dr. Galenson, who by this time knew&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;

ROSEMIARY-&#xD;
&#xD;

the house, led the way into the back room, where a long table&#xD;
was very temptingly laid for dinner. The gas was already&#xD;
lighted, claret stood in coolers, an oaken side-board, handsomely&#xD;
carved with emblems of the chase, was loaded with fruit in&#xD;
elegant plated baskets.&#xD;
"Hem!" said Dr. Mannikin, with his peculiar smile ; "Helen&#xD;
Tankerville must be over head and ears with debt from furnishing&#xD;
this house.-So,-doctor !--you didn't treat me well in this mys-&#xD;
tification !"-lifting, as if unconsciously, the silver-basket that&#xD;
stood near, and which was weighty with forks and spoons ready&#xD;
for the service of the table.&#xD;
"My calling you in now proves the contrary, doctor," said&#xD;
Galenson.&#xD;
"Ah !-so you didn't make an autopsy after all?-You dis-&#xD;
covered that the heart--"&#xD;
"BEAT, doctor !"&#xD;
" Ah! of course. And so you succeeded, not without diffi-&#xD;
culty, in restoring animation and consciousness. Pity you&#xD;
didn't admit me to your counsels. Shutting me out of the dis-&#xD;
secting-room-it vas discourteous, doctor-and unwise too-I&#xD;
might have saved you a great deal of trouble, and your patient&#xD;
these unpleasant sequele, doctor."&#xD;
"It is not yet too late, doctor, for the exertion of your incon-&#xD;
testable skill," said Galenson. "It is simply required to supply&#xD;
an antidote to a most remarkable poison, singularly permanent&#xD;
in its influence, and which, nevertheles, has produced no organic&#xD;
lesion."&#xD;
"You are convinced that my young friend up stairs has been&#xD;
really poisoned ? Pause, my dear doctor, before you pronounce&#xD;
:af opinion of that decided nature."&#xD;
"It is one that can never be proved if she recover, I allow,"&#xD;
replied Galenson, astutely. "Should she die--"&#xD;
"It may, you think l I doubt it very much, my dear doc-&#xD;
tor !"-v-with his peculiar smile. "Very much I doubt it. Still&#xD;
we must do what we can to prevent her dying-there I agree&#xD;
with you."&#xD;
"Were it. only to spoil a pretty case for the lawyers, and&#xD;
those rascally newspapers," said Galenson, laughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CONSULTATION.           55&#xD;
&#xD;
"How so ?" Another death's-head grin.&#xD;
"Oh! because, in case of her 'death, I should of course report&#xD;
to the coroner, and have alb the circumstances investigated.&#xD;
Even if an.antopsy discovered nothing, we should not lack what&#xD;
the herald ccus 'rich develoihnents.' We should get on the&#xD;
track of our friend Jol)in ald his colored associate. You&#xD;
yoursel f, doctor, and nysel f, my pupils, our friend Count Wis-&#xD;
sen, niust give our testimony. Once in the way of publicity,&#xD;
every material fact will come out."&#xD;
Duing this ti am iof remark, which evinced on the part of Dr.&#xD;
G leninn great lucidity of ideas, Dr. Manilkin regarded him&#xD;
winh a stare of stony attention. At the conclusion, he drew&#xD;
from his great-coat lpocket a small morocco case. It was fi;led&#xD;
with minute vials. Selecting one which contained a dark red&#xD;
fluid, and simply marked on the cork with an oriental character,&#xD;
he consigned it to his professional brother.&#xD;
" Aduinister to your patient, Dr. Galenson, five drops of that&#xD;
tincture in a spoonful of water three times a day, for three days.&#xD;
Support her st length with brandy. Feed her with essence of&#xD;
beef. If that course does not bring her round, she is beyond&#xD;
my skill."&#xD;
IHere a servant-a man-servant-brought in the soup: it was&#xD;
served in an obl-fashioned silver tureen, engraved with the&#xD;
family arms of the Tankervilles. Dr. Mannikin gave a more&#xD;
than usually sinister smile at the sight of this article of table&#xD;
furniture. Passing out through the front room, of which the&#xD;
folding-doors were now thrown open, he encountered the mis-&#xD;
tress of the house. Miss Tankerville dropped him a curtsey that&#xD;
covered half the medallon of the carpet with her black silk&#xD;
flounces. Dr. Mannikin returned the salute with a wave of his&#xD;
broadbrim  hat, and .a courtier-like bend of his semi-quaker&#xD;
body.&#xD;
The boarders-a well-dressed crowd of gentlemen and ladies&#xD;
--were already ' motion towards the dining-room.&#xD;
" Won't you take pot-luck with us, Dr. Mannikin'I" said Miss&#xD;
Taekerville, with another profound reverence.&#xD;
'Professional engagement, Miss Tankerville, alone prevent&#xD;
my accepting your kind invitation."&#xD;
&#xD;

"Professional engagements are sacred, doctor-I must excuse&#xD;
you, then."  And she swept on.&#xD;
" Excuse me, doctor," said the gentleman on whose arm Miss&#xD;
Tankerville leaned: it was Count Wissenl.'&#xD;
A white-haired gentleman said a brief grace, and the cere-&#xD;
mony began.&#xD;
"Well, Miss Tankerville, how is your patient T' inquired her&#xD;
nearest neighbor, unrolling his napkin.&#xD;
"We are full of hope, count. I met Dr.Galeflon on the stais&#xD;
just now with a little red vial in his hand, which, he itimates,&#xD;
is going to do the business."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
CONVALESCENCE-A NEW CHARACTER.&#xD;
THE red tincture works like magic.&#xD;
Dr. Galenson called the first morning. Nurse meets him with&#xD;
an air of importance: the patient has waked three times in the&#xD;
night to ask for food, which she devours with greediness. For&#xD;
three days more, existence seems purely animal, divided be-&#xD;
tween food and slumber, like a new-born babe's. On the fourth&#xD;
day the convalescent began to ask questions, and it was evident&#xD;
that all which had passed during her previous illness was re-&#xD;
membered only as a painful dream. She recollected a great&#xD;
horror on first coming to herself in a strange and dreadful&#xD;
place, a charnel-house (as she described it) surrounded by&#xD;
strange men and by the bodies of the deal:-this she attributed&#xD;
to delirium, perceiving by her weakness that she had experienced&#xD;
a severe illness of some sort. Next, she recalled with vividness&#xD;
a glimpse of a frozen and moonlit river, over whch she was&#xD;
dreamily borne by attendant angels :-this, of course, was also&#xD;
a dream! The interview with Dr. Mannikin was distinctly and&#xD;
painfully. impressed :-" Was it real or not ?"  Ages had ap-&#xD;
peared to pass in this delirious fever, and yet the moment in&#xD;
which she had seemed to herself expiring, was but as yesterday&#xD;
--" Where was she now? Where was grand-papa ? Grand-&#xD;
mamma ? Grace ?"&#xD;
When the young person learned, in answer to these queries,&#xD;
that those by whom she was surrounded were ignorant of her&#xD;
family name, s  fell into a deep revery. At last she said to&#xD;
Miss Tankervifle, when that lady was alone with her,-&#xD;
" Explain to me how it happens that I am not among my own&#xD;
friends ?"&#xD;
"My dear Miss Rose-for I know that such is your Christian&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6853-00000031"/>&#xD;
58                    ROSEMARY.&#xD;
name--it is more than two months since your friends supposed&#xD;
you dead. You have been recovered in a manner little less than&#xD;
miraculous, but who you are, we do not yet know, and conse-&#xD;
quently we have not been able to inform your friends of what&#xD;
has happened."&#xD;
"Two months';" ejaculated the young person.&#xD;
"We found your - card," pursued Miss Tankerville, to whom&#xD;
Dr. Galenson, under a pledge of secrecy, had confided all the&#xD;
particulars of the.case, "and your linen was also marked with&#xD;
your Christian name--"&#xD;
"My Christian name!" repeated the young person. "But&#xD;
my card has my name in full !"&#xD;
"It was not your card, in fact, but the inscription on your&#xD;
coffin," said Miss Tankerville.&#xD;
" Ah ! I was buried, then-it is not a dream !" exclaimed the&#xD;
unhappy girl, with an expression of sudden anguish. "Bring&#xD;
me the clothes," added she, impetuously, "in which I was brought&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Miss Tankcrville had caused the articles of under-clothing to&#xD;
be freshly done up, and they were brought in a laundry-basket.&#xD;
The young person blushed and looked puzzled as she examined&#xD;
them: but they were all marked in red silk with exquisite neat-&#xD;
ness, and she seemed better satisfied. "Where is the dress 'I"&#xD;
shee=asked.  Miss Tankerville produced it from a wardrobe,&#xD;
which-formerly used by young O'Morra-now contained noth-&#xD;
ing else. At sight of it, a thousand memories evidently flashed&#xD;
back on the questioner, who burst into tears. She asked no&#xD;
more questions in regard to herself, nor would she answer any.&#xD;
"Pray keep all quiet for the present," said she, in answer to&#xD;
Miss Tankerville's request to know the name of Jier family, in&#xD;
order that Dr. Galenson might communicate with them imme-&#xD;
diately :-" keep all quiet for the present--what may not have,&#xD;
happened in two months 'i"&#xD;
On the whole Dr. Galenson considered tha  ere was good&#xD;
sense in this. That gentleman, to own the truth, had never&#xD;
taken any special pains to unveil the mystery, perhaps for fear&#xD;
lest the management of so interesting a case should be taken&#xD;
from him. For his own part he had never mentioned it, except to&#xD;
&#xD;
CONVALESCENCE-A NEW        CHARACTER.        59&#xD;
the parties who had witnessed the scene in the dissecting-room.&#xD;
Of these O'Callaghan and Fitzfulke were medical students, and&#xD;
their lips were sealed by professional honor; besides they were&#xD;
preparing for their examinations, and had something else to think&#xD;
of. Two months slip away unobserved when unfledged doctors&#xD;
are reading up before taking their degrees. O'Morra's silence&#xD;
hardly needs explanation-silence was Rory's forte.  Count&#xD;
Wissen, who had been absent for several weeks, in Washington,&#xD;
was a soldier and a diplomat; professions in which discretion is&#xD;
the first of virtues. The only difficulty lies in explaining how a&#xD;
woman could be equally discreet, especially after Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville had been formally entrusted with the secret. This will be&#xD;
justly regarded as more intrinsically improbable than any other&#xD;
incident, however extraordinary, that we have yet recorded. We&#xD;
have been able to account very rationally for the strict reticence&#xD;
of all the men concerned, including Dr. Mannikin, who, like&#xD;
Johnson and his black associate, had perhaps a crime to conceal,&#xD;
or a great professional misdemeanor to hush up: but we do&#xD;
not undertake to explain the taciturnity of a woman in such a&#xD;
case, unless by the rule of contraries. Mis 'Tankerville per-&#xD;
haps held her tongue because she had so many reasons, motives&#xD;
and temptations to talk. She was rather a remarkable person,&#xD;
though, was Miss Tankerville,&#xD;
Accordingly a week passed from the date of the conversation&#xD;
above related, during which time the subject was not again&#xD;
referred to; but the convalescence of l\Iiss Maria (as she was&#xD;
called for want of a better name) advanced with rapidity. She&#xD;
was able to sit up a great part of the day, and it became neces-&#xD;
sary to provide her uith appropriate clothing. Miss Tanker-&#xD;
Ville now suggested that on applying to her friends, her own&#xD;
wardrobe would be sent to her.&#xD;
"Tut!" said the young lady, impatiently. "For such a trifle&#xD;
it is net worth while to distlrb them prematurely. Till I am&#xD;
able to return in person, my dear Miss Tan.kerville, the best way&#xD;
will be to provide myself with a suitable outfit. Besides, all my&#xD;
clothes have been given away, and under no circumstances".&#xD;
with an expression of wounded sentiment.-" will I receive any&#xD;
of them back,"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6853-00000032"/>&#xD;
CONVALESCENCE-A NEW CHARACTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"How do you know that your clothes have been given&#xD;
away ?" demanded Miss Tankerville, with astonishment.a&#xD;
"It is sufficient that I know it," she answered, with an air of&#xD;
sudden reserve. "Why speak of a matter of so little conse-&#xD;
quence ? There are plenty of stores in Broadway where a&#xD;
young lady can be fitted out on a few days' notice with every-&#xD;
thing she requires."&#xD;
"No doubt of that, but where is the money to come from'&#xD;
To fit you out properly, that is at all in the way to which you&#xD;
are accustomed, will take at least two hundred dollars, ard to&#xD;
tell the truth I have never twenty to spare."&#xD;
" Oh ! is that all i" says madlemoiselle, quite carelessly&#xD;
" There I must borrow of somebody else."&#xD;
"Of whom, I pray, my dear child ? Not of Dr. Galenson, I&#xD;
hope: he is por as Job's turkey."&#xD;
"Of course, Miss Tankerville, I am already in Dr. Galenson's&#xD;
debt for attendance, and I;could not ask, in any case, a young&#xD;
unmarried man like him to lend me money," replied Rose&#xD;
Marie, with dignity.&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin, perhaps ?" audaciously suggested Miss Tank-&#xD;
erville. "He is rich, an old friend, and knows your timily."&#xD;
"You jest," said the young woman, with a slight look of an-&#xD;
noyance.&#xD;
"Who, then ?" persisted Miss Tankerville. "For these two&#xD;
comprise, I think, all your male acquaintance as a fair incognita,&#xD;
my dear Miss Mare6 !"&#xD;
"What sort of person," asked the young lady, after a moment s&#xD;
reflection, "is this Mr. O'Morra, whose apartment I occupy ?&#xD;
By the little luxuries and useless elegancies about, he should not&#xD;
be poor."&#xD;
"My dear child ! he is younger than Dr. Galenson-a youth&#xD;
of scarce three and twenty !"&#xD;
" Ah !" said Rose Marie with a vivid blush. "I thought he&#xD;
was an elderly gentleman. Didn't you tell me the photograph&#xD;
over the study-desk was a portrait of Mr. O'Morra'P'&#xD;
"That is the old gentleman, Mr. Rory's father 1" said Miss&#xD;
Tankerville, laughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh! there is an old gentleman, after all!" said the young&#xD;
lady, much relieved. "What is he V"&#xD;
"A lawyer".----&#xD;
" A lawyer !" interrupted the young woman, impatiently.&#xD;
"Then I'm afraid he has no money to spare. An Irish lawyer,&#xD;
too! no! that's hopeless-if he were only a merchant !'&#xD;
"Mr. O'Morra has money enough, if that's all," said Miss&#xD;
Tankerville, very much amused. "Few lawyers in New York,&#xD;
I fancy, enjoy a more lucrative practice : the only question is,&#xD;
will he lend it to an utter stranger?"&#xD;
"Of course he will, on proper security, and I should never&#xD;
dream of asking it without. Where aremy pearls, Miss Helen ?"&#xD;
"I declare I never thought of the pearls," said Helen Tanker-&#xD;
ville. "Of course you can borrow money on them, if you&#xD;
choose."&#xD;
They were produced. Rose Marie asked for paper and pen-&#xD;
cil. It seemed she had a turn for figures. She made promptly&#xD;
a list of the articles required. Adding in her board for two&#xD;
months, of which she surmised Miss Tankerville, according to&#xD;
her own statement, stood in need, and various expenses of her&#xD;
recent illness, she found that she needed, even with strict eco-&#xD;
nomy, the pretty little sum of $500.&#xD;
CNow," said she,."take that list to Mr. O'Morra, who will&#xD;
see that it is all of imperative necessity, and that the money I&#xD;
mnust and will have; and then show him the pearls, which cost,&#xD;
you may tell him, five times the amount in Paris. The finest&#xD;
set at Tiffany's is only $650, and if he wishes to know the value&#xD;
of these--I don't want him to take them to Tiffany's, mind--&#xD;
but all he'has to do is to order home three or four of their most&#xD;
expensive sets for examination: he will easily see the difference.&#xD;
When he is satisfied, he will please fill me out a cheque for the&#xD;
sum I require."&#xD;
Miss Tankervile was astonished, but did as she was requested.&#xD;
Mr. Cabal O'Morra was sitting in his own private parlor,&#xD;
where a study-light illumined a table covered with Jaw-papers.&#xD;
The room was fitted up rather as a library than as a parlor, and&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra, senior, had all the air of a student. The son of an&#xD;
exile, though a man of high, almost princely birth, he had begmn&#xD;

life poor, and had risen by his talents, which were of the highest&#xD;
forensic order, and by the force of a character of rare intensity,&#xD;
not only to wealth, but to a professional position almost un-&#xD;
rivalled. Becoming a widower early in life, with an only son,&#xD;
whose education the immense toils of his profession utterly for-&#xD;
bade him to superintend, he had sent Rory to a Jesuit college&#xD;
at a very early age, and lived 'himself, not parsimoniously, but&#xD;
nearly as a bachelor. He had long known Miss Tankerville,&#xD;
had been one of her boarders from the first, had assisted her&#xD;
with money and advice on various critical occasions, and yet&#xD;
that lady stood not a little in awe of him. O'Morra was noted&#xD;
among men for his bitter severity ; and speaking generally, he&#xD;
was cold though courtly towards women. Contrary to wbat is&#xD;
usually attributed to Irishmen, he was not in any ordinary occa-&#xD;
sion accessible through his feelings; and though very kind to&#xD;
the poor and profuse in secret charities, he had no compassion&#xD;
for genteel distresses, and little faith in the virtue or sincerity of&#xD;
the better, or ra other better-dressed classes. Hence, Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville approached him on her present errand with many mis iv-&#xD;
ings. These were not diminished by the circumstance that the&#xD;
young person whose embassadress she was, had entered the house&#xD;
under the patronage of Mr. Rory O'Morra, and was actually the&#xD;
occupant of that young gentleman's room. Rory's character&#xD;
and tastes were as much the cause of chagrin to his father, as&#xD;
his son's personal beauty and admitted talents were an occasion&#xD;
of pride. He had planned to train him for his own profession,&#xD;
and ultimately for a political career, in which his name his birth,&#xD;
his fortune and his talent would open to him the way to the&#xD;
highest distinctions. To his infinite disgust, Rory took a great&#xD;
dislike to the law. He had studied it, it is true, from filial obe-&#xD;
dience, and had been admitted to the bar; but his tastes were&#xD;
all literary and artistic; he was the intimate of all the Bohemians&#xD;
in New York, the associate of all the artists, and after much&#xD;
teasing he had obtained from his father, who passionately loved&#xD;
and could deny him nothing, a reluctant permission to try his&#xD;
hand privately at sculpture. Mr. O'Morra, who never conde-&#xD;
scended to breathe au inquiry in regard to a matter so utterly&#xD;
beneath his notice, had nevertheless understood that the young&#xD;

person who had somehow been installed in his son's apartment,&#xD;
had entitled herself to his "chivalrous" aid in the course of one&#xD;
of Rory's artistic and Bohemian adventures. While he Supposed&#xD;
that the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was certainly dying,&#xD;
Mr. O'i\Iorra did not trouble himself about her; but wheng,&#xD;
learned by the conversation at table, that she was, to his sincere&#xD;

THE LAWYER.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE LAWYER.&#xD;
TaE apartment of Mr. Cahal O'Morra merits a brief descrip-&#xD;
tion. It was the largest room on Miss Tankerville's second&#xD;
floor, and had two high windows, one looking south, the other&#xD;
west, so that the occupant could enjoy a double view. Being&#xD;
night the curtains, which were of green, danasked in gold,&#xD;
were closely drawn. The walls up to a certain height were&#xD;
fitted with bookcases richly carved in solid oak, filled with law-&#xD;
books in their well-known tawney binding, and crowned with&#xD;
busts. Washington had the place of honor, on the case between&#xD;
the two doors of the room; another, devoted to Irish orators,&#xD;
pleadings and laws, was surmounted by the head of O'Connell;&#xD;
John C. Calhoun occupied a conspicuous position ; the rest were&#xD;
either great statesmen or great lawyers. At one end of the&#xD;
room, near the fire-place, stood a large sofa carved in oak and&#xD;
upholstered in green billiard-cloth ; there were library chairs to&#xD;
match; and the same tints of quiet green and oak-color were&#xD;
repeated in the soft thick carpet that muffled every tread. Over&#xD;
the handsome, old-fashioned, rather low mantelpiece of Egyp-&#xD;
tian marble, a huge mirror, framed in oak, repeated the whole&#xD;
length of the room ; including the bronze chandelier, that dif-&#xD;
fused a soft light from burners shaped like antique lamps ; and&#xD;
the study table, also of massive oak, and covered with law-pa-&#xD;
pers, over which it was suspended ; and where Mr. O'Morra was&#xD;
sitting in a great high-backed arm-chair. A flexible tube&#xD;
dropped from the chandelier to a study-light below, to assist&#xD;
the lawyer's labors.&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra looked up from his writing as Miss Tankerville&#xD;
entered. He was a tall, spare man, with a pale, somewhat thin&#xD;
face, regular, aquiline and sharp, a large spectral dark-gray eye,&#xD;
&#xD;
a very finely formed forehead, shaded by hair both gray and&#xD;
scanty. His mouth was very characteristic, somewhat promi-&#xD;
nent, with thin bitter lips, which opened'(as he welcomed Miss&#xD;
Tankerville) in a smile where kindness contended with habitual&#xD;
sarcasm.&#xD;
"Have the goodness to be seated, Miss Helen," he said, with-&#xD;
out rising. or laying down his pen.&#xD;
"I am afraid I interrupt you, Mr. O'Morra," said Miss Tank-&#xD;
erville, but taking a chair near the table.&#xD;
"You shall not interrupt me," replied Mr. O'Morra, sarcas-&#xD;
tically smiling, while his pen continued to pursue its work.&#xD;
"It is a little matter of business-I won't detain you long&#xD;
with it," said Helen Tankerville.&#xD;
"What is it about ?" asked Mr. O'Morra, still busily writing.&#xD;
"About the young lady in the next room, your neighbor, sir,&#xD;
-Miss Marid, I mean. She wants to borrow a little money of&#xD;
you to re-furnish her wardrobe," said Helen, thinking it best&#xD;
and bravest to plunge at once into the deepest water of the dif-&#xD;
ficulty,&#xD;
"I shan't lend it her," replied Mr. O'Morra, without any emo-&#xD;
tion. "if that is your errand, Miss Helen, you may spare your..&#xD;
self and me all further trouble."&#xD;
"Now, Mr. O'Morra !" said Helen, who had Irish blood in her&#xD;
veils too, and was a famous wheedler:-"just lay down that&#xD;
pen of yours for a few minutes, and give your best attention to&#xD;
what I have to say."&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra carefully wiped the pen, laid it down, pushed&#xD;
back his chair a little, so as to confront Miss Tankerville, laid&#xD;
his gray thin head back on the cushion, looked at his watch&#xD;
(as much as to hint at brevity), and said : "Proceed, madam-.&#xD;
I am all ears !"&#xD;
Miss Tankerville stated the case as pathetically and concisely&#xD;
as she could. She insisted in the first place on the fact that&#xD;
Miss Marie had been brought to the house in a state of uncon-&#xD;
sciousness by his son, which gavether a claim to the kindness&#xD;
and chivalrous hospitality of the O'Morras. Secondly, he must&#xD;
know-perhaps he had heard-that she was brought there in a&#xD;
bridal dress-white moire antique and satin slippers-and of&#xD;
&#xD;
65&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
course she needed other clothes, in order to return to her&#xD;
friends. Thirdly, wishing to purchase what was required for&#xD;
that purpose, she was under the necessity of borrowing, and&#xD;
offered, as security, to pledge her jewels, which Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville, who had arranged them in an oil jewel-case of her uwn,&#xD;
proceeded to display before Mr. O'Morra's dazzled eyes.&#xD;
That gentleman listened gravely, but wi h a look of deter-&#xD;
mined non-sympathy. Tne pearls, however, were a fact that&#xD;
staggered him. He examine(l them carefully ; lie laid them&#xD;
out on the green clnth of his study-table, where their clouded&#xD;
yet lustrous whiteness seemed to gain a new splendor.&#xD;
It is a superb set, no doubt; but how do you know that it&#xD;
is really hers 1"&#xD;
"flers !" repeated Helen. "You should have seen her when&#xD;
she was brought here.  There was everything to match, I&#xD;
assure you. The most elegant thing I ever saw in my life.&#xD;
The lace on her dress alone must have cost several thousand&#xD;
dollars. See this ! it is her veil-I brouht it without her know-&#xD;
ledge just to show you-the most magnificent point you ever&#xD;
saw ! and large enough to envelope her whole person! what do&#xD;
you think of that, Mr. O'Morra ?"&#xD;
"It is a princess incognita !" said Mr. O'Morra".&#xD;
"Hers ! As well ask if a corpse has stolen or borrowed its&#xD;
shroud !" said Helen, indignantly..&#xD;
"A forcible illustration, but infelicitous: for a corpse has no&#xD;
property, and could not pledge even its shroud. It is a natural&#xD;
supposition that these articles do not belong to this young&#xD;
person, who is a minor and is unmarried, but to her father. I&#xD;
dare say she's honest !"&#xD;
"And the sweetest girl you ever saw ! Take my word for&#xD;
that. If there is a genuine bit of calico anywhere hereabouts,&#xD;
it is this Miss Marie. There, now you have it, sir !"&#xD;
"And how much does this nonpareil in petticoats wish me to&#xD;
lend her '"    .&#xD;
"Why, sir, as to that, her notions are those of a young lady&#xD;
used to the greatest libera ity in her wardrobe, both as to&#xD;
quantity and quality ; and she desires to pay her board, which&#xD;
may as well hold over:. but here is her estimate."&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra took the paper and glanced over it.&#xD;
"Whew! Five hundred dollars !--For necessaries a minor&#xD;
can incur debt--but what's all this.     e      s        r&#xD;
(Reads) "Half doz. fine muslin skts-.-.---$45 00&#xD;

dred, and her pearls in the neighborhood of three thousand -&#xD;
lars, may well require a five hundred dollar outfit to make a&#xD;
morning call. I ought to be surprised that she is so moderate."&#xD;
At first, Miss Tankerville did  ne            o oderat."&#xD;
in earnest, or as one of Mr. O'Morra's sar       He soos&#xD;
relieved her of the doubt.             sarcasms. He soon&#xD;
"Just think now," he continued, "of the&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra's lip curls-" a lady to the tips of her fingers;&#xD;
innocent, injured, just recovered f: om a nearly mortal illness ;"-&#xD;
O'Morra begins to write again-" and you refuse her a trifling&#xD;
loan-you, who boast of always keeping a balance of thousands,&#xD;
and two or three bank accounts-you, Cahal O'Morra ! And&#xD;
all because your son brought her here ! I understand itall.&#xD;
Yet Rory, I can tell you, never saw her except in her coffin!"&#xD;
"In her coffin ?" said Mr. O'Morra, laying down his pen&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Well, yes, since I've said it-in her coffin; that's how she&#xD;
was brought here, sir, by Count Wissen, Dr. Galenson and your&#xD;
son."&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra turned round again in his chair, and resumed&#xD;
his attitude of attention. His spectral gray eyes were fastened&#xD;
searchingly on Miss Tankerville.&#xD;
"Go on," said he, as if he were addressing a witness on the&#xD;
stand.&#xD;
"No, sir, I've said more than enough already, more than I&#xD;
have permission to say on the part of those whose secret it is:&#xD;
so if you're not going to lend Miss Marie this money, I'll go and&#xD;
tell her so at once."&#xD;
"Stop !" said the lawyer.&#xD;
Cabal 0'Morra was the most eminent criminal lawyer in the coun-&#xD;
try perhaps : his sagacious nostrils snuffed a case, or rather a cause,&#xD;
possibly a cause cslebre. It was not at all a mercenary instinct, but&#xD;
a professional and artistic one, which made him now detain Miss&#xD;
Tankerville, and endeavor to extract-further particulars, which&#xD;
his practised skill easily enabled him to do, even without her&#xD;
suspecting it.&#xD;
"Don't be a fool, Helen," said he, as she half angrily, half&#xD;
politically, insisted upon going. " I will give you the money :&#xD;
I am going to write a cheque this minute."&#xD;
"Now. that's Cabal O'Morra.  I declare, who would have&#xD;
thought that a good scolding would do you so much good V" said&#xD;
Helen, quite overjoyed at this unexpected success.&#xD;
Somehow Mr. O'Morra had mislaid his cheque-book-for&#xD;
he always kept one at home, exclusively for domestic expenses&#xD;
--a most methodical man was O'Morra. When he found it, he&#xD;
&#xD;
was for ever filling out the cheque ; and meanwhile he continued&#xD;
to question and cross-question Helen Tankerville.&#xD;
Of course, Miss Helen, I can put two and two together well&#xD;
enough to comprehend that if Rory and Dr. Galenson brought&#xD;
Miss Marie here in her coffin, it was at the medical college that&#xD;
she came into their hands."&#xD;
Not a thousand miles from it, I reckon," said Helen.&#xD;
"I had better make this cheque payable to bearer, I think.&#xD;
And so Dr. Galenson suspected poison'? Is there a poison&#xD;
capable of producing such effects ?"-Raising the pen from the&#xD;
paper.&#xD;
"He says there is, though only one person that he knows of&#xD;
is acquainted with it."&#xD;
"A cousin of yours, Helen ?" With a grim, satisfied smile,&#xD;
and playing with the plume of the quill. "But I understand&#xD;
that this young person owes her recovery to Dr. Mannikin ?"&#xD;
"I did not mention Dr. Mannikin, sir."&#xD;
"Of course not. And so she refuses to tell you her real&#xD;
name?"&#xD;
"She wont answer any questions at all about herself."&#xD;
"She is discreet. And you do not think the name is&#xD;
'lMarid.'"&#xD;
"I don't ; and yet it would be strange if the family name of&#xD;
a deceased person were not put upon her coffin-plate !"&#xD;
"Very strange !" said Mr. O'Morra, with a peculiar look.&#xD;
"I should think it would be easy to find out," said He'len&#xD;
"if one could get hold of a file of daily papers. The Deaths&#xD;
or itarriages, one or the other, would be sure to have it."&#xD;
"Or both,' said Mr. O'Morra, tearing off the cheque he hail&#xD;
written, and then deliberately tearing it up.-Miss Tankerville&#xD;
started in disappointment:&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, Miss Helen, I am going to write another.&#xD;
I was 50 interested in what you were saying that I forgot to ue&#xD;
my bank signature. By the way, what do you think of your&#xD;
young friemnd' dule of expenses here ?"-..pointing to Rose.-&#xD;

"What purpose ?" asked the lawyer.&#xD;
"To get into a carriage anti make a call on her friends, which&#xD;
is what she intends, evidently."&#xD;
"Ahem! Miss Marie had better not do that without making&#xD;
inquiries first. Are the clothes-is money-the difficulty? I&#xD;
ask, Miss Helen, because I don't want to cut her down-eli ?"&#xD;
"If you are serious in that, Mr. O'Morra, and really wish to&#xD;
know my opinion, I can tell you that to get up a complete varl-&#xD;
robe for a young lady in the circle to which Miss Marie plainly&#xD;
belongs, with such a sum as that, is out of the question. She&#xD;
has cut herself down to absolute necessaries ."&#xD;
"It seems so," said O'Morra, gravely, and filling up the cheque&#xD;
in earnest. He dashed the sand over it, and handed it to Miss&#xD;
Tankerville.&#xD;
"There are the pearls, sir."&#xD;
"Excuse me," said Mr. O'Morra, pushing them back. "I am&#xD;
not going to make myself responsible for their safe keeping.&#xD;
By the way, I doubt the prudence of a young woman's retain-&#xD;
ing such things in her room, in a house that half the nights is&#xD;
protected but by a night-latch. Robberies have been frequent&#xD;
in Brooklyn of late, and we are rather isolated here. A party&#xD;
of burglars, with a simple night-key and a little chloroform&#xD;
might easily carry off Miss MariC and her pearls too. I hope&#xD;
she bolts her door at night."&#xD;
"I doubt if Rory's room has a bolt."&#xD;
"Have one put on to-morrow !"-With a spectral glance of&#xD;
warning, out of his weird eyes. "People capable of committing&#xD;
a crime like that of which she has been nearly the victim, would&#xD;
not hesitate a minute about committing another to conceal it.&#xD;
This is a villainous world, madam I"&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you for this," said Helen, looking&#xD;
at the cheque.&#xD;
"Not at all," said O'Morra, who, in spite of his sneers, under-&#xD;
stood perfectly the requirements of a certain worldly position,&#xD;
and who, though infinitely crabbed, was far above all meanness.&#xD;
Besides which, he had undoubtedly a reason-almost intuitively&#xD;
arrived at by his subtle and far-reaching mind-for , liberality&#xD;
beyond Miss Tankerville's expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I hope Miss Marie," added he, courteously rising ,--" tell&#xD;
her to stick to that name, by all means-i hope she will be dis-&#xD;
creet. And as for that trifle, if she prefers to do so, she can give&#xD;
me a written acknowledgment, over her real name ell ?" con-&#xD;
cluded the lawyer.&#xD;
In a few minutes Miss Tankerville returned from Rosemary's&#xD;
room, with a sheet of note-paper, on which was written in a&#xD;
clerkly hand, after the date--&#xD;
" Due to Cabal O'Morra, Esq., $750, value received.&#xD;
"ROSE MARIE."&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra bit his lip.--" The saucy jade !" he murmured&#xD;
But he put the autograph carefully away in his pocket-bo-ok.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE PURCHASE.&#xD;
ROSEMARY'S beautiful short upper lip curled at Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville's account of her interview, with Mr. O'Morra. She shrug-&#xD;
ged her pretty shoulders, like a Frenchwoman, at the amount&#xD;
of the cheque.&#xD;
" If Mr. O'Morra thought fit to exceed the sum that I asked,"&#xD;
said she, "why didn't he double it ' Seven hundred and fifty&#xD;
dollars ! As if I had asked for fifty cents, and he had gene-&#xD;
rously loaned me seventy-five !-three quarters of a dollar ! He&#xD;
is liberal, Miss Helen-I feel it-but he is not confiding I He&#xD;
fears that I shall misspend it, if he lend me too much."&#xD;
"But surely you have now more than sufficient," replied Miss&#xD;
Tankerville. "In a few days you will have returned to your&#xD;
friends---"&#xD;
"Pardon me, how do you know that'P" demanded Rosemary.&#xD;
"I understood that such was your intention, certainly, in bor-&#xD;
rowing this money."&#xD;
"You are Lot very penetrating, then, my dear Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville. If such were my intention, how simple would it be to&#xD;
send a note summoning one of 'my friends'-as you call them-&#xD;
to visit me here 'i In a few hours I should have evet thing&#xD;
that I require without borrowing of anybody. Do you suppose&#xD;
that I am planning a theatrical surprise for my family, now&#xD;
buried in affliction at my supposed decease ?"&#xD;
"Upon my word, I rather thought so."&#xD;
" Pray have a better opinion of my good feeling and good&#xD;
sense."&#xD;
There was a pause.&#xD;
"What, then, do you intend'" at length inquired Miss&#xD;
Tankerville.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PURCHASE.                    73&#xD;
"I see it is necessary for me to explain myself, lest you should&#xD;
compromise my plans by such imprudent revelations as you&#xD;
have made to Mr. O'Morra."&#xD;
'I am all attention."&#xD;
"I do not mean to return to my family, Miss Helen--that is&#xD;
to my family here. I have a--relative-a parent-in Europe,&#xD;
to whom I mean to write at once explaining my situation. Till&#xD;
I iear fIIm that relative, whose claim upon me is superior to&#xD;
that of any onemliving, I wish to remain i the greatest retire-&#xD;
ment, and that my existence may not be suspected."&#xD;
"And leave your friends here, who evidently have lovedayou&#xD;
almost to exes, a prey to inconsolable grief !' cried Helen.&#xD;
"My dear Miss Helen ! what do you know ' about that ?"&#xD;
asked the young girl, with emotion.&#xD;
Miss Tankerville was silent: for she in fact knew nothing.&#xD;
"That blow has fallen !" pursued Rosemary, almost passion-&#xD;
ately. " Pardon me! I have little to learn, Miss Helen, in re-&#xD;
gard to the effect of my sudden death upon those who really&#xD;
loved me. My grandfather"-her voice trembled--" was struck&#xD;
down as by lightning.  He lives a living death-intellect&#xD;

you must excuse me for not saying anything. My return home&#xD;

the innocent and guilty alike would suffer. Hence I wish to&#xD;

relations in Europe, do you require so expensive an outfit as&#xD;
you have proposed 3"&#xD;
It was now the turn of the younger lady to be astonished.&#xD;
"You consider my estimate extravagant? Pray, tell me&#xD;
what item can be left out or cut down . 1 thought that I had&#xD;
been rigidly economical !"&#xD;
Miss Tankerville explained that the sum which Miss Mar16&#xD;
devoted to a single silk dress, would buy two such as she&#xD;
herself was accustomed to wear ; nd that a similar reduction&#xD;
of at least one-half could be made on every article of her esti-&#xD;
mate, and yet she would be as well dressed as any young lady&#xD;
visiting in Miss Tankerville's circle pretended to be, on any&#xD;
ordinary occasion. Then it was almost summer, and muslins&#xD;
would be more useful than silks, and a vast deal cheaper-&#xD;
"cI understand you now, Miss Helen," interrupted Rosemary.&#xD;
"Please, then, make my purchases according to your own idea&#xD;
of what is proper for a young lady moving in your circle-I&#xD;
place myself entirely in your hands !" added she with a fascin-&#xD;
ating smile.pefcl&#xD;
Armed with this permission, and now comprehending perfectly&#xD;
what was required, Miss Tankerville soon procured her guest a&#xD;
wardrobe iii which no unpractisedl eye would have discovered&#xD;
the least want of propriety, or even of.elegance, and which&#xD;
without exhausting Miss Maris's purse, amply supplied all her&#xD;
wants. And although it fell very far short of what that young&#xD;
person had been accustomed to, both in cost and in style, as her&#xD;
innocent wonder at the prices of things proved, she never made&#xD;
the slightest objection to anything that came under the, head of&#xD;
visible costume. .The only point in which she insisted upon&#xD;
her own programme, very slightly modified, was that of thedun-&#xD;
der clothing, or rather of all, except lace, which is included in&#xD;
the trousseau, comprising suceliaisa        ankrhes&#xD;
under-sleeves, etcetera, for which Miss Tankerville was positively&#xD;
dispatched with a list, and certain measures, to a celebrated&#xD;
outfitting establishment on Broadway.&#xD;
"The order is to be made up, of course: that will require&#xD;
tine," said the forewoman of the ladies' department in this&#xD;
great "store," looking at the list intelligently.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PURCHASE.                     75&#xD;
"It will, unless you can hit the measures exactly," said&#xD;
Helen.&#xD;
"I will see," said the forewoman.&#xD;
The forewoman consulted the cutter, and then she&#xD;
to Miss Tankerville with a question: Did the young lady for&#xD;
whom these things were wanted, wvear hoops?   Th&#xD;
was pertinent at that date, for this sovereign pfash-hei mquiry&#xD;
cently come in and was not yet universal.&#xD;
" Oh ! ,I forgot," said Helen. "She has never worn&#xD;
utterly refuses to do it."ne                  o  one, and&#xD;
"Then I think I'can suit you," said the forewoman&#xD;
lovely outfit-very cheap."   .                      with a&#xD;
With the assistance of one of the other shop-girls&#xD;
carton box was got down, which the forewoman pe large&#xD;
displayed an elegant bride's outfit: the box had been  ad&#xD;
pressly to contain it when sent home, for it was fancifully covered&#xD;
with silver, paper, now somewhat tarnished evidently an ar-&#xD;
rangement for some magnificent and tasteful customer.&#xD;
" This trousseau, ma'am, was ordered several months ago for&#xD;
a ouglaywh wsgon to be married, but she died,=.to&#xD;

turned it herea to e sold-I declare, this measure fits exactly !"&#xD;

with the name, parties object to them.-Why t1he emeasres&#xD;

"What name is it ?" inquired Miss Tankervill  argam.&#xD;
moment that the I                          ile, at the very&#xD;
e forewoman produced it, beautifully embroi-&#xD;
dered, as she said, in red silk, on an exquisitely fine but oer-&#xD;
wise rather simple handkerchief. It was the same mark ich&#xD;
the hadeore seen on the cambric centre of a costly cobweb&#xD;
the twenty years' work of a Brussels lace-makerb ic&#xD;
fan beyond price, had once hung by the radian a    w&#xD;
arm and bore the name of "RosE MARIE."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6853-00000040"/>&#xD;
CONVALESCENCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" What was the family name of the young lady who died ?"&#xD;
Miss Tankerville could not forbear asking.&#xD;
"Oh, indeed, ma'am, I couldn't tell you that. We were di-&#xD;
rected to have the marking carefully picked out, but it is such&#xD;
a tedious job, and these fine things never look as well again, so&#xD;
it being only the Christian name, we thought as we would leave&#xD;
it and see if it wouldn't suit some one, maybe."&#xD;
Miss Tankerville suspected that the absolute impossibility of&#xD;
effacing all trace of this exquisitely delicate marking was also&#xD;
the motive of the apparent frankness displayed in admitting the&#xD;
history of the outfit, which was without peradventure the most&#xD;
serious obstacle to its sale.&#xD;
"The lady, on whose account we sell it, will submit to a very&#xD;
handsome reduction on the original cost price, ma' am."&#xD;
"There must be more than my order," said Miss Tankerville.&#xD;
" There's just double on every piece, ma'am; I've just com-&#xD;
pared our list with mine: but in a few of our items there is&#xD;
one piece short-it was used, and so not returned with the&#xD;
rest," observed the forewoman, with tranquil unconsciousness&#xD;
of the meaning of her words&#xD;
"This marking is beautiful, but it is a serious objection to a&#xD;
person of a different name," observed Miss Tankerville, in a&#xD;
depreciating tone. She had no scruple in getting the things as&#xD;
cheaply as possible.&#xD;
"It is easy picked out," said the saleswoman.  We will do&#xD;
it so that nobody will ever know it was there."&#xD;
"You just now said the very reverse," remarked Miss Tank-&#xD;
erville, with a smile, and examining the elaborate embroidery&#xD;
of the name. "it is a very serious objection, as I consider."&#xD;
"Well, miss, we think we shall meet some one of the same&#xD;
name yet !" replied the forewoman.&#xD;
" Do youT" said °Miss Tankerville, looking up at her.&#xD;
"Sure to turn up sooner or later in our business, ma'am."&#xD;
"Well, what do you give the whole for 'i" said Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville.&#xD;
The saleswoman consulted some mysterious signs on the back&#xD;
of the printed list and named a price. Very curiously, it was&#xD;
the extreme limit which she had agreed upon with Rosemary,&#xD;
&#xD;
to be appropriated to this item of expenditure. The astonishing&#xD;
coincidence that for this very sum she should obtain the original&#xD;
bridal outfit of this mysterious girl, affected her so strongly that&#xD;
in counting out the bills to pay on the spot, she thought every-&#xD;
body must notice her agitation. Her hands trembled and she&#xD;
acted like a raw country girl making for the first time a grand&#xD;
purchase. She nearly forgot to give her address, which the&#xD;
forewoman repeated with emphasis: " Miss Tankerville No.&#xD;
R- street, Brooklyn Heights :" and all the young ladies be-&#xD;
hind the counters smiled as she drew down her veil and departed.&#xD;
"Now," thought Helen, as she got into the Wall street omni&#xD;
bus, "this is the most extraordinary thing yet. What sort of&#xD;
feelings must Rosemary's friends have for her memory, rich as&#xD;
they are, to dispose of her outfit, marked with her name too, in&#xD;
this unfeeling way ! It looks as though they wanted to get rid&#xD;
of every trace of her, and yet not lose money by the operation,&#xD;
if they can help it."&#xD;
She did not breathe a syllable of this adventure to the young&#xD;
lady herself; till the well-known parcel-wagon of the great&#xD;
Broadway establishment arrived it the evening with the box for&#xD;
Miss Tankerville. It was carried up to Miss Marie's room. A&#xD;
slight gravity of expression came over her at sight of it; but&#xD;
when they were alone, and Miss Tankerville had opened it, and&#xD;
Rosemary's glance fell upon the beautifully arranged contents&#xD;
laid in the compactest form, an even surface of snowy plaits and&#xD;
rich embroidery, she dropped on one knee, raised one ,of the&#xD;
lighter articles with a trembling hand, and recognizing the name&#xD;
sank softly down upon the carpet in a violent tremor and faint&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
Helen, frightened at what she had done, brought restoratives&#xD;
rosemary, bending back like a young willow, put them awa&#xD;

to me-all-all-all !-So will the rest-the REST!"&#xD;
She rose to her feet. She drew up her figure to its graceful&#xD;
height.&#xD;
"Helen Tankerville !' Can you conceive that in order to pos-&#xD;
sess such vanities as strew this carpet, and as the robe and&#xD;
jewels yonder, a life was sought, in the most unsuspecting&#xD;
moment of its dutiful happiness' For I was just doing my&#xD;
duty, and happy in doing it, though I trembled. You see that&#xD;
the poor prize could not remain with those who coveted it :&#xD;
they will lose all as they have lost these. The money which&#xD;
you have paid for it all, will come at last out of the treasure&#xD;
they think they have secured: that is what I expect, Helen.&#xD;
Their own act has made it irrevocably mine !-Well! I will wear&#xD;
these things-no one but myself will know it-what the world&#xD;
sees of Rosemary's attire they will not envy ! For do they not&#xD;
possess a thousand times finer ?' But no! they are obliged to&#xD;
wear mourning--black robes, like nuns, but without merit or&#xD;
love. They can go to no festivities-they must defer their&#xD;
nuptial plans at least till I am supposed to have been dead one&#xD;
brief year! Meanwhile I am the only one of my family who&#xD;
will not wear weeds: for I mourn only the living, who suffer,&#xD;
but whom I must not yet try to comfort; whom I fear I could&#xD;
not comfort, if I would. It is ridiculous," added Rosemary,&#xD;
with a half-ashamed look, seating herself lightly on the arm of a&#xD;
large easy-chair-  1 it is ridiculous to be so excited by such an&#xD;
incident, but my dear Miss Helen, I am only a girl, you know,&#xD;
and I could not help it."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
.       RORY 'S RoOM--MISS TANKERVILLE'S STORY.&#xD;
THE young stranger had plenty of time during her convales-&#xD;
cence, and that seclusion which her already enough insisted on&#xD;
deficiency of proper apparel more than excused, to make her-&#xD;
self well acquainted with the apartment she occupied. She had&#xD;
some natural curiosity, perhaps the time hung heavily on her&#xD;
hands. To the invalid every article in the sick-room becomes&#xD;
dreadfully familiar, down to each particular. square of the car-&#xD;
pet, each fold of window drapery, or pane of glass. The geo-&#xD;
graphy of the walls and ceiling is carefully studied, especially if&#xD;
tthe room is papered ; or if not (which is best) then the very&#xD;
stains, the cracks, the colxvebs. Then some apartments are&#xD;
eminently suggestive : a F bench littsrateur wrote when sick a&#xD;
charming paper, called Le tour de ma cltambre--4 think it was.&#xD;
Rosemary often considered in this spirit the various objects&#xD;
m her temporary prison. There was first the very bedstead&#xD;
where she lay, an architectural structure of solid mahogany such&#xD;
as pertained to the best style of housekeeping some thirty or&#xD;
forty years ago, before we introducedthe French patterns. t&#xD;
seemed quite out of place in a'. young bachelor's room: his&#xD;
grandparents might have slept out their marriedlives under its&#xD;
stately canopy. So the ancient mahogany wardrobe which held&#xD;
Rosemary's bridal dress. Its great solid doors blazed like suns&#xD;
with the ioh veins of the wood : it was directly opposite the&#xD;
bed's foot, and the light was always upon it. On the top was a&#xD;
cast--the helmed and martial head of an ancient warrior. Rose-&#xD;
mary was never tired of looking at it. Whatever else pertained&#xD;
to a bedroom was of the same suite, such as the bureau and&#xD;
tory, a very solemn piece indeed, with a cover that shut&#xD;

down upon the basin and ewer ; and an escritoire, with infinite&#xD;
small brass-handled drawers, all of the same old golden maho-&#xD;
gany. She judged with reason that these must be 1elics of Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra's housekeeping days, when lie as happy with the wife&#xD;
of his youth, and Master Rory was a baby.&#xD;
She rather judged this, because there were also relics of a&#xD;
parlor, a brass-nailed sofa and hard, roomy hair-bottomed chairs:&#xD;
but there was one gloriously luxurious stuffed easy-chair,-its&#xD;
place was always before the fire,-and in which Rosemary en-&#xD;
joyed many a refreshing slumber ; an old-fasLioned easy-chair&#xD;
in ahich two like her could have nestled, with resting-place for&#xD;
the sick or weary head on either side, and great stuffed elbows&#xD;
for the arms, a true invalid's " Sleepy Ho:low," such as our&#xD;
fathers and mothers consecrate d to sickness, but mostly un-&#xD;
known in modern bed-chambers.&#xD;
Now this kind of thing, whether found in a boarding-house or&#xD;
in some family residence in town or country, is essentially aris-&#xD;
tocratic; which the luxurious surroundings of upstart wealth&#xD;
in our Fifth Avenue palaces are not. Here are people who lived&#xD;
in comfort and elegance when you, 0 gilded grandee ! kept a&#xD;
candy-shop ! when your father and mother, 0 silken and ara-&#xD;
besqued magnifico ! laid the foundation of your splendid fortune&#xD;
by selling tripe ! An antiquity of five-and-twenty years is not&#xD;
much,,it is true : but your luxury is hardly of five years date.&#xD;
I know a man whom the magnates of Murray Hill and Madison&#xD;
Square would consider it a great condescension to invite to their&#xD;
houses ; and yet his great-grandfather spent a fortune in shoe-&#xD;
ing the naked feet and clothing the shivering backs of a whole&#xD;
regiment of their great-grandfathers, to persuade them to return&#xD;
to Valley Forge and to the side of Washington! We consider&#xD;
that we paint the character and bringing-up of Rosemary when&#xD;
we say, that in spite of her own moire antique and pearls and&#xD;
point lace, if she had found herself in a room filled with the&#xD;
choicest and costliest sumptuosities of a Fifth Avenue mansion,&#xD;
of what is called the first class, she would in her own secret&#xD;
judgment have set down the 0' Morras as pretentious upstarts,&#xD;
and rather despised them: whereas now she conceived that they&#xD;
were certainly "a respectable family."  Not a gilt-chair and&#xD;

satin-damask family-not a rosewood and brocatelle family-.&#xD;
but what we may fairly call an old mahogany family I&#xD;
One effect, doubtless, was that the young lady never suspected&#xD;
till she was on the mend, that it was a young man's room  she&#xD;
supposed that a venerable widower, thin, severe and gray, the&#xD;
original of the photograph hanging over the escritoire, had ceded&#xD;
the place to the claims of her sex and dangerous sickness&#xD;
"La !" said Miss Tankerville, in reply to her careless questions&#xD;
"these old time affirs belonged to Rory's mother: lie values&#xD;
every stick of it beyond all price."&#xD;
Honor thy father and thy mother" said Rosemary, "that&#xD;
thou mayst be long-lived upon the land. Your Mr. Rory is a&#xD;
good son : long life to him !"&#xD;
Further inspection, indeed, brought under her observation&#xD;
many decidedly young-manmsj5h peculiarities  It is tr  th&#xD;
when she was able to trot about and open drawers and uet&#xD;
she discovered no trace whatever of masculine attire; the drat&#xD;
es were empty, the shelves vacant. Rosemary appreciated the&#xD;
delicacy of this: it was a silent intimation that she was t e&#xD;
herself perfect at home, and so long as suited her convenimake&#xD;
A timid inquiry elicited the fact from the maid who serve er,&#xD;
ad tr. Rory had made himself very comfortable in the attic,&#xD;
th     h   give up his room down stairs, because "he could&#xD;
See eh ships there first rate.,,co&#xD;
Bridget herself opened that it was too big a room for a young&#xD;
gentleman, and too many things "into it," and it was mor&#xD;
tul to see it occupied by a lady: and Mr. Rory thought so&#xD;
too.&#xD;
"The lad is a gentleman !" thought Rosenary  "Well,&#xD;
cording to the old view, I honor him by occupying his aa-&#xD;
ment : so we are quits !"&#xD;
From the first she had noticed a good deal a certain perman&#xD;
enith fitrern te wall over the sofa: it was a gun-rack filled&#xD;
with olitterig arms. Then the desk contained fishing-tackle,&#xD;
uethon! artificial flies, and to Rosemary's horror-a pow&#xD;
draworings! bit turned out to be empty. Mixed with these&#xD;
drangs architectural plans, crayons, sonnets, the commence&#xD;

RORY'S ROOM--MISS TANKERVILLE'S STORY.  83&#xD;
&#xD;
82                     ROSEMARY.&#xD;
This desk, with its innumerable drawers and pigeon-holes, was&#xD;
in an inconceivable hullabaloo. The keys being left in, she&#xD;
considered as a tacit permission to ransack its contents, and I&#xD;
am afraid that the curiosity inherited from Mother Eve did not&#xD;
suffer her to desist until all the drawings had been inspected,&#xD;
er e       the tragedy, the novel, to its latest unfinished chap-&#xD;
ter has been diligently perused, and finally every nook and&#xD;
er hof the whole concern had been reached by her inquisitive&#xD;
eyesand fingers. Nay, I must except one; a secret drawer,&#xD;
st cleverly concealed, but not cleverly enough to baffle&#xD;
mostn'scwitit contained letters, lockets, locks of hair, old&#xD;
jewelry, a perfune-bag which scented the whole desk, and a&#xD;
female miniature on ivory, in the costume of twenty-five years&#xD;
ago, and though not precisely beautiful, a most interesting face.&#xD;
Rosemary breathed a prayer against the sin of curiosity, a&#xD;
reclosed this drawer without touching anything. She fear&#xD;
that she had already gone too far tut by way of acknowled&#xD;
ing her impertinence to the owner the next time he opened his&#xD;
escritoire, she put it carefully in order.1"arthmeoilof&#xD;
"Now here," thought the young girl, Care the memorials of&#xD;
past happiness. How much pride Mrs. O'Morra took in her new&#xD;
furniture twenty-five years ago, when she was a bride! That&#xD;
old brass-nailed sofa was thought a splendid affair, no&#xD;
She has leaned her head against the side of this easy-chair&#xD;
many a time; perhaps in her last illness: she breathed her last&#xD;
probably under the canopy of that grand old bedstead ! Well,&#xD;
well! we shall go in our turn !"&#xD;
But Life was beating strongly now in the bosom of Rose-&#xD;
mar, and although she indulged a pious and tender sentiment&#xD;
about those who were gone, and like a good Christian breathed&#xD;
a De profundis for their repose, it was the living who interested&#xD;
her most. The works of art in the room had always caught her&#xD;
eye, but by degrees it was upon them that her attention, con-&#xD;
sciously or unconsciously, chiefly rested. The mantelpiece was&#xD;
covered with sculpture, "reduced," from beautiful works of the&#xD;
German Catholic School: in the centre a fine crucifix. The&#xD;
wall above it was adorned with bas-reliefs in the same taste ; aid&#xD;
to mark the purely artistic interest which placed them there,&#xD;
&#xD;
they were not framed. On a pedestal in one corner stood the&#xD;
Roman Pudicitia, entirely enveloped in the folds of her d'apery ;&#xD;
in another, the Flora of the Capitol, the most beautiful draped&#xD;
female statue of antiquity ; in another the magnificent draped&#xD;
Antinous of the Lateran : these were all reduced by the method&#xD;
of Collas, and of course even the slightest corrosion of the orig-&#xD;
inals by time, perfectly represented. The lower part of some&#xD;
sirnp'e bookshelves was occupied with the superb folios of "The&#xD;
Vatican ;" and by its side, the magnificent Roman "Anatomy&#xD;
for the use of Sculptors and Painters :" Miss Rosemary just&#xD;
opened it and replaced the volume as speedily as possible.&#xD;
Without knowing any thing of this young man's pursuits, Rose-&#xD;
mary felt that nothing shot of a strictly professional interest&#xD;
could account for so large an outlay in one line of art. And yet&#xD;
there was not a single nude in statuary, bas-relief or ornament&#xD;
outside the great volumes of the Roman collection, which the&#xD;
-young, girl had not strength or patience to examine. This pu-&#xD;
rity of taste in a young sculptor did not so strike her that she&#xD;
formally adverted to it, but it' inspired an unconscious respect&#xD;
that enhanced the sympathy which Mr. Rory's pursuits and&#xD;
obvious genius excited.&#xD;
Yes, there was one nude, clothed only with the divine ma-&#xD;
jesty that awes every heart, the Form of the Redeemer on the&#xD;
cross! Rosemary said her prayers night and morning with her&#xD;
eyes fixed on this majestic Image.&#xD;
It will be seen that there'was a good deal' here to interest&#xD;
the feelings of a young woman whose heart was unoccupied,&#xD;
but whether that of Rosemary was so, remains yet to be seen&#xD;
As we have found her on then&#xD;
whichesheveeemsntoheavenrthe very threshold of a marriage&#xD;
which she seems to have regarded with no reluctance, we may&#xD;
presume the contrary ; and that was perhaps the reason why&#xD;
she appeared so extremely tranquil on the subject,&#xD;
indifferent about leaving  e aqi  nth    ubet and so&#xD;
indi~rct aoutleaingher seclusion and making the ac-&#xD;

was sixteen, when my poor mother (the Lord have mercy on&#xD;
her!) died, and I was taken from my lessons to preside over the&#xD;
house and to play a mother's part to an infant sister."&#xD;
"Is that the young lady who has dropped in to see me several&#xD;
times, and who calls you 'Miss Tankerville 3' "&#xD;
"The same," with a smile. "Didn't she tell you that she&#xD;
was my sister ?"&#xD;
"She did, and that her name was Laura, and that she was not&#xD;
yet eighteen-so I can tell your age now pretty exactly, Miss&#xD;
Helen : you are in your thirty-fourth year."&#xD;
"Did Laura tell you that she was married ?"&#xD;
"Not she! why, I called her Miss Laura all along, and she&#xD;
did not correct me."&#xD;
"She has a little boy six months old, which is the reason you&#xD;
have seen so little of her."&#xD;
"And pray what is her matron name ?"&#xD;
" Varick-Mrs. Dashon Varick:"&#xD;
Rosemary started as if she had been shot.&#xD;
"I dare say you know her husband's family ?"&#xD;
"Is it Captain Dashou Varick of the Navy?   Yes, I know&#xD;
them !" sail Miss Mari, drawing a long breath. "Pray, is&#xD;
Captain Varick at home ?"&#xD;
"lHe has been absent a year on a three years' cruise, and of&#xD;
course has never seen his boy : that's one of the pleasant things&#xD;
about marrying a sailor."&#xD;
"lie is a great deal older than your sister," observed Rose-&#xD;
mary.&#xD;
"I should hope so, since she is under eighteen, and he com-&#xD;
mands a frigate. Capt. Varick, however, is a year younger&#xD;
than I am, Miss, and that is very young for his position."&#xD;
"Well, I knew-tlat-that-Ca)t. Varick had married very&#xD;
much against the wishes of his family, but I either never heard&#xD;
the lady's name mentionedsor I had forgotten it: I wasrd&#xD;
school at the time. Is there ir      s&#xD;

"The Varicks have never taken the slightest notice of us&#xD;
since nor we of them," said Miss Tankerville, with a comical air.&#xD;

"I believe, however, that it is not the first mssalliance which&#xD;
their people have contracted, for all they are such grand seig-&#xD;
neurs at present. There was Capt. Varick's cousin, handsome&#xD;
Dick Dashon, whom all the girls of my school-days were in love&#xD;
with, myself among the number !"--laughing gaily, though&#xD;
with a slight tremor of the voice:--" what did he do but make&#xD;
a clandestine match with the daughter of his French teacher !&#xD;
Certainly that was worse than a Tankervillel'&#xD;
Rosemary blushed vividly.&#xD;
"Dick Dashon's daughter is now a great heiress, they say;&#xD;
and the Varicks wanted the Captain to make up to her; but he&#xD;
is a brave honest sailor, and preferred a simple-hearted girl with&#xD;
some beauty and the greatest innocence, although she might be&#xD;
the sister of 'a lady who keeps a boarding-house,' to all the&#xD;
pproi heiresses in creation."&#xD;
The color had mounted to Rosemary's brow at the beginning&#xD;
of Miss Tankerville's last speech, as if she were about to make&#xD;
an indignant rejoind'er ; but she cooled down, bit her lip in vexa-&#xD;
tion, and ended by smiling outright.&#xD;
"I remember when the name of Dr. Tankerville was as re-&#xD;
spectable in the city as that of Dr. Varick-"&#xD;
"Capt. Varick's father," observed Rosemary.&#xD;
" Precisely. Our house gathered everything that was distin-&#xD;
guished in the city at that time :-Dr. Post, Mitchell, Francis,&#xD;
Stevens, Mott, Cheeseman, and old Augustine Smith. were my&#xD;
father's intimates. Our house was on Broadway, and my father&#xD;
was one of the three doctors who then made visits in a chariot:&#xD;
Dr. Varick used a gig." .&#xD;
"It is a clear case!" said Rose Marie, laughing.&#xD;
"About two years after my dear mother's death, an addition&#xD;
was made to our forlorn domestic circle by the return of my&#xD;
cousin Ezekiel, who immediately began practice under my fath-&#xD;
er's eye. It was a very agreeable addition too, for Ezekiel had&#xD;
seen the world, and was a very accomplished man as well as a&#xD;
thoroughly taught physician. He had not only studied in Paris&#xD;
but travelled very extensively, even to the furthest East. I need&#xD;
not describe his person, as it is well known to you: he was then&#xD;
a young man under thirty, not handsome certainly, but very&#xD;

distinguished, with nothing of the Quaker about him, but an oc-&#xD;
casional thee and thou which escaped him when excited having&#xD;
in dress conformed to this sinful worldaand the latest fashions&#xD;
of Paris. Some early escapades of his in a country school, his&#xD;
adventures as a teacher of calligraphyin six lessons, which&#xD;
ended by his being kicked down stairs by an indignant pupil&#xD;
whose cash he had taken according to his invariable rule in ad-&#xD;
vance, and the failure of an attempt to make a fortune by the&#xD;
invention of a patent medicine, were F'orgotten even in Vermont,&#xD;
and I should only have known them by hearing my father amuse&#xD;
some confidential friend years before, when I was a mere child,&#xD;
with the recital of these juvenile achievements of his quaker&#xD;
nephew. There was only one point on which my father took&#xD;
an early opportunity to give me a warning : which was to be&#xD;
careful to regard my cousin Ezekiel simply as a cousin, inaiuch&#xD;
- as the prime of his youthful scrapes had been a very injudicious&#xD;
marriage, and his wife, though separated from him for many&#xD;
years, was still living."&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin is married ! Ah ! but he is a widower at pre-&#xD;
sent ?" said Rosemary with an air of surprise.&#xD;
"He a widower ! No such good, news for him as that, my&#xD;
dear! Mrs. Mannikin lives in this very house, mademoiselle !&#xD;
She is one of my boarders."&#xD;
"You astonish me. She is, then, a woman--of-good char-&#xD;
acter ?" asked Rosemary, uneasily and dubiously, almost a&#xD;
little frightened.&#xD;
"Exemplary, though extremely poor ! To tell you the truth,&#xD;
my dear, it was she who was your nurse while you needed such&#xD;
attendance.'&#xD;
"What! that quiet, kind Mrs. Grace, so humble, so shy, so&#xD;
lady-like ! She is a lady, then ?" said Rosemary.&#xD;
" If Dr. Mannikin be a gentleman (which should not admit of&#xD;
a doubt),. his wife should be a lady. Please, however, not to&#xD;
call her Mrs. Mannikin, as it would be disagreeable to her. She&#xD;
lives in mortal fear of her husband, who, she thinks, has studied&#xD;
the subject of Poisons so profoundly, in order to get rid of her&#xD;
without detection. The day he was here to visit you, she con-&#xD;
cealed herself in the closet in order to see him unobserved--for&#xD;

the first time in ten years. The scene between you and the&#xD;
doctor impressed her profoundly. Peeping down from behind&#xD;
the little round window over your bed, she could see your face&#xD;
and his perfectly without being seen : and it was startling&#xD;
enough to any one, I assure you; so you may imagine what she&#xD;
felt. I see that your indignation is rising, Rosemary !"&#xD;
The expressive countenance and figure of Rose Marie con-&#xD;
veyed, indeed, a most energetic abhorrence: but mixed with a&#xD;
blush of virgin pride.&#xD;
"I believe," said she, calmly, with her great eyes fixed on&#xD;
Miss Tankerville, " that  that man is capable of the worst ac-&#xD;
tions. A married man!"&#xD;
"Indeed, my dear, you look at this moment, as if, were he&#xD;
herbyou could annihilate him."&#xD;
"That poor Mrs. Grace !"&#xD;
"Yes! there is a life and a. heart crushed ! She once had&#xD;
beauty; and she loves that man still. lie had not only ill-used,&#xD;
betrayed and deserted, but traduced and persecuted her. He&#xD;
has alleged as the reason of his abandonment that her child&#xD;
was not his; although the boy, now a man, and grown up his&#xD;
father's -very image, is the living demonstration of his mother's&#xD;
fidelity. But the real motive was that Mrs. Mannikin was&#xD;
under-bred; not that exactly; country-bred is the word ; a&#xD;
plain little body ; he never could teach her fashionable man-&#xD;
ners; she would not, could not, drop certain provincialisms that&#xD;
offended Ezekiel's delicate taste; in society she eternally ex-&#xD;
coriated his pride. Hence he separated from her after a few&#xD;
years, but while he was still only twenty-one or two; it was&#xD;
before he graduated in medicine ; for he was a student at col-&#xD;
lege when they married; a foolish, runaway affair just like his&#xD;
mother's. If he had not feared Mr. O'Morra, who is distantly&#xD;
related to poor Mrs. Grace, and secretly maintains her, he&#xD;
would have sued for a divorce; but Cahal O'Morra told him:&#xD;
'Do it, and I will tear your character into such shreds on the&#xD;
trial, that it will never be patched together again in this&#xD;
world!' "&#xD;
"Good for Cahal O'Morra !" cried Roscmary, with vehemence.&#xD;
"My father," continued Miss Tankerville, "supposed that&#xD;

Ezekiel's charges against his wife were true, and he conse-&#xD;
quently did not blame his nephew for the separation, though he&#xD;
did for forming so imprudent a connection, which he never ex-&#xD;
pected would turn out well. He praised him also for not seek-&#xD;
ing a divorce, which a Catholic could not regard as authorizing&#xD;
him to marry again : but he thought fit to let me know how&#xD;
matters stood, with many expressions of pity for the situation in&#xD;
which so fine a young man, with such excellent prospects, was&#xD;
placed by a juvenile folly..&#xD;
"So I was prepared to receive my cousin with the greatest&#xD;
affection and respect ; and when my father introduced him to&#xD;
me one day at dinner, and he looked so decidedly distinguished&#xD;
in his Paris-made clothes, and with his grand travelled manner,&#xD;
and said, kissing me on both cheeks"-Rosemary made a little&#xD;
wilful pout:-" 'My fair cousin will pardon me, I am sure for&#xD;
asserting the privilege of saluting her!' if anybody was ever&#xD;
captivated with a relation under those circumstances, it was I,&#xD;
"This was at the, beginning of the winter, and partly to ex-&#xD;
tend Ezekiel's acquaintance-for my father treated him exactly&#xD;
like a son, and partly to introduce me into society, as I was&#xD;
now fully eighteen, we gave a large party. Among people of&#xD;
course invited were Dr. and Mrs. Varick, and they asked an in-&#xD;
vitation for their nephew and niece, a young Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
George Varick-oh ! no doubt you know them-who had then&#xD;
been married only a year or two. I was curious to see Mrs.&#xD;
George. because she was a cousin of Dick Dashon's. and report&#xD;
said she had been much chagrined at his marriage to the French&#xD;
teacher's daughter that I told you about-if you remember?"&#xD;
" Oh ! I remember perfectly," said Rosemary, in a very sar-&#xD;
castic tone.&#xD;
"Now I don't know who you are, my dear Miss Marid-but'&#xD;
if I am going to wound your feelings by saying hard things by&#xD;
and by about the Varicks-if you belong to them, perhaps&#xD;
had better stop."&#xD;
"Say anything you please about them : if it be true, I shall not&#xD;
be wounded," said Rosemary with a rather demure look.&#xD;

dressed woman there, she captivated everybody, my cousin&#xD;
Ezekiel especially, and myself. She visited me in a very short&#xD;
time afterwards, and I returned the call forthwith. It became&#xD;
an intimacy, she would drop in almost daily to see me, and&#xD;
sometimes stay to dinner-take 'pot-luck,' as she called it: for&#xD;
my dear new friend was a trifle vulgar sometimes---"&#xD;
Rosemary blushed.&#xD;
"Sometimes Ezekiel made up parties to go to the theatre to-&#xD;
gether, Mrs. Varick to matronize me : she was a great conve-&#xD;
nience on many occasions when I wished to enjoy fashionable&#xD;
pleasures and needed a matron friend in order to do so with pro-&#xD;
priety. The world, indeed, smiled upon me then, although&#xD;
some of my graver friends advised me not to go out so much with&#xD;
Mrs. Geo. Varick, as she was extravagant, giddy, too fond of ad-&#xD;
miration, and all that ; and her husband as fast as herself in a&#xD;
different way and perhaps less reputable ; and a young lady's&#xD;
matrimonial chances would not be improved by such associations&#xD;
with her name ; and then I would try to be less with her ; but&#xD;
bless you! it was impossible : Mrs. Varick was more adhesive&#xD;
than a burr, or down, or what you will.°&#xD;
"But there was an epidemic that summer, and my gayety&#xD;
was changed to sorrow, my dressing for parties put a stop to by&#xD;
putting on mourning once more ; death succeeded to the stir of&#xD;

little he would take, at last he was himself attacked and died in&#xD;

could get away, out of town ; and 1 was left alone in the world&#xD;

"THE house we lived in at the time of my father's death, he&#xD;
had built expressly according to his own ideas, about seven&#xD;
years before, a period when he considered himself a very wealthy&#xD;
man for a physician. It was a London basement, with three&#xD;
stories above the basement, and attics. The lot extended to the&#xD;
back street, where there was a stable and carriage-house with&#xD;
a large and pleasant yard intervening, with a trellised grapery&#xD;
flower-beds, grass-plat, and a sunny exposure ; a lovely place&#xD;
for a child to play. The rent in those times was estimated at&#xD;
only $1,200: but that was before the gold of California had&#xD;
Come in. At that tie the Broadway omnibuses use'd to stop&#xD;
at the corner of .Bleecker street. I have no doubt my father&#xD;
hoped that his children would continue to occupy this house for&#xD;
many years after he was dead and gone,&#xD;
" He occupied the entire basement for his office and library:&#xD;
as he always had students, it was necessary. A back-buildin&#xD;
afforded a dining-room on the same floor with the basement,&#xD;
and a billiard-room above, which when my mother gave her&#xD;
great annual party (in the month of January, after the bills of&#xD;
the preceding twelvemonth had been collected), was converted&#xD;
into a dancing-room. The drawing-room suite was imported&#xD;
from Paris; it was the talk of the city at the time; and as it&#xD;
ws always kept covered with brown linen except on occasion&#xD;
of the great parties before mentioned, New Year's Day, and the&#xD;
lie solemnities, the satin and gilding were absolutely as fresh&#xD;
as the day it was unpacked. The enormous French mirrors&#xD;

tains and carpets were new that year. The old doctors of that&#xD;

MISS TANKERVILLE S STORY, CONTINUED.&#xD;
&#xD;
time lived splendidly. Dr. Tankerville was fond of entertaining&#xD;
his professional brethren, and men of science from other cities&#xD;
or the old world. He had choice wines in his cellar ; his side-&#xD;
board was full of plate ; his portrait and my mother's,&#xD;
painted by Inman, looked down upon his guests; and they used&#xD;
to smoke their cigars afterwards in his library, filled with the&#xD;
choicest medical and scientific authors. It was while he was in&#xD;
this opulent feeling that he undertook Ezekiel's education,&#xD;
which cost him, on an average, a thousand a year for ten years.&#xD;
He could still lay by $5000 annually, for the interest on his&#xD;
accumulation amounted to that ; and Dr. Tankerville was the&#xD;
reverse of a miser.&#xD;
"But (not to be too precise) about four years before his&#xD;
death, my father began to experience heavy losses. In the first&#xD;
place, the large dividends then made by the insurance compan-&#xD;
ies tempted, himto invest .a very considerable part of his fortune&#xD;
in insurance stock, and he considered himself perfectly secure&#xD;
because he had but a moderate amount in each institution: but&#xD;
then came an event which nobody had foreseen, the great fire of&#xD;
1835, which swamped all the companies in the . city in one&#xD;
night. I remember being rather protd to tell my companions&#xD;
of the amount my father had lost by this general disaster. I&#xD;
had little idea what a difference it was going to make in my&#xD;
destinies.&#xD;
"My father said that few of the sufferers could bear it better:&#xD;
he had.as much left as he had lost, and a large professional&#xD;
income,,and was only. fifty.years old; he had twenty years of&#xD;
work in him yet, and he would. die . rich. Two years later, a&#xD;
bank which suspended in '37, and in which he held a hundred&#xD;
shares, was one of the few that did not recover: the cashier had&#xD;
robbed it; he was the near. relative of one of Dr. Tankerviile's&#xD;
professional friends ; efforts were made to hush it up, and suc-&#xD;
cessfully : my father pocketed his own loss without a word,&#xD;
for an exposure, as the young man was just married, would&#xD;
have carried disgrace to more than one proud fireside. The&#xD;
name of the defaulting cashier was Varick."&#xD;
Rosemary reddened.&#xD;
" These were losses to bite deep into a professional fortune.&#xD;
&#xD;
For all that, considering there were only two of us, both daugh-&#xD;
ters, we were left well provided for. My father's will, which he&#xD;
executed just before the epidemic-.for he seemed to have a&#xD;
presentiment that summer would be fatal to him-gave me the&#xD;
house on Broadway, with all the furniture, plate, pictures,&#xD;
horses, carriages, excepting only the medical books and things&#xD;
in the office. Two houses in Walker street, rent $550 each&#xD;
were left to Laura, to avoid trouble about .settling the real&#xD;
estate ; and to her also, as a set-off to the furniture, was&#xD;
bequeathed the sum of $6,500, loaned on bond and mortgage.&#xD;
The remainder of the estate consisted of the balance at the&#xD;
bank (Chemical), which at that time of the year began to run&#xD;
low, and the bills of the year yet uncollected : after paying&#xD;
charges, legacies, and current accounts, the net residue, which&#xD;
actually amounted to nearly $9,000, was to be divided equally&#xD;
between Laura and myself. Till Laura came of age, or mar-&#xD;
ried with my consent, I was to enjoy the income of her portion&#xD;
as well as of my own, in order to provide for her maintenance&#xD;
and education."&#xD;
"A   very reasonable will," said  Rosemary.  "And   Dr&#xD;
Mannikin ?"&#xD;
"To Ezekiel my father bequeathed his medical library the&#xD;
office-furniture, instruments, medicines, &amp;amp;c., and $500 a year&#xD;
for, two years; or, if I continued to live in the house, the rent&#xD;
of the basement free for that period; assigning as his reasons,&#xD;
that Ezekiel had already a sufficient practice fo hi persona&#xD;
support, and that in two years more his success ought to be&#xD;
assured."&#xD;
" Considering'that your father had already spent $10,000 on&#xD;
his education: that was liberal enough," said Rosemary. "I&#xD;
admit that if your father had not met severe losses, he might have&#xD;
well done more, A man is not like a girl ; he can make money;&#xD;
all he wants is a start."&#xD;
"Ezekiel nevertheless was very angry at the will. He said&#xD;
the $500 should have been $1,000, and for five years insteadaof&#xD;
two: it was well enough to give him a library; he would be&#xD;
oiged to sell it to pay his board : Dr. Tankerville might at least&#xD;
have left him one of the horses for his buggy. The buggy, by&#xD;

the way had been a New-Year's present from my father. He&#xD;
had the indelicacy, as Mr. O'Morra considered it, to say so to&#xD;
me, and I replied immediately:&#xD;
"'Cousin Ezekiel, my father was afraid of seeming to injure&#xD;
his daughters, but he has left me the income of the whole prop-&#xD;
erty because he knew that I would do whatever was right:---&#xD;
you shall have a thousand a year for five years, and a horse, "&#xD;
" Did he accept it'?"w&#xD;
"Of course he did ; but Mr. O'Morra, who was trustee as well&#xD;
as executor, obliged him to take the horse he was actually&#xD;
using; for Ezekiel wanted one of the pair my father drove in his&#xD;
chart which would have spoiled the span, for they were beau-&#xD;
tifull matched in action, height and color ; not fast, but a&#xD;
showy team for city use, and brought $800 at the sale.&#xD;
"The next thing was to consider what was to be done with&#xD;
us, and whether or not there should be a sale. Mr. O'Morra'&#xD;
would not allow that there could be a question on the last&#xD;
point. Dr. Mannikin insisted that my father had contemplated&#xD;
our remaining in the house, and keeping all together. I was&#xD;
of Dr. Mannikin's opinion, both because he bad great influence&#xD;
over me, much greater than Mr. O'Morra, whom I thought very&#xD;
cold and stern and unsympathizing, while Ezekiel was smooth&#xD;
as oil, and plausible even in his selfishness ; and more than&#xD;
that, my own feelings vehemently inclined to that side. The&#xD;
idea of breaking up, selling our furniture at auction, quitting&#xD;
the house where I had passed so many happy years, where Laura&#xD;
was born,;here my parents had died, and going to live among&#xD;
strangers, to board after having been mistress of a fine estab-&#xD;
lishment, seemed to be perfectly unendurable. Nor was it at&#xD;
all impossible to keep up the house on the means I had. By&#xD;
selling the horses and carriages, and letting the stable, I could&#xD;
increase my income to $2,000 clear, and as I had no house-rent&#xD;
to pay, I could easily get along with that,- and board Ezekiel,&#xD;
who was willing to take the $500 I had promised him, in&#xD;
that shape. Of course I could not keep four servants: two,&#xD;
would have to serve my turn, and Dr. Mannikin must hire a&#xD;
little boy to answer the bell. I fought for this project with&#xD;
desperation. Mr. O'Morra declared that it was a thing unheard-&#xD;

"This was a home-thrust. I felt indignant in behalfof Eze-&#xD;

light. But that gentleman was inflexible. In vain I represented&#xD;
to him that my father evidently wished his children and Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin, whom he regarded as a son, to keep together; in&#xD;
vain I represented the advantage to Laura of a home education,&#xD;
and the cruelty of scattering all our dearest associations; and&#xD;
showed him how easy it was for me to procure the companion-&#xD;

diately to see me, and found me preparing for the sale. She&#xD;
entered fully into my sentiments on the subject, declared that&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra was a perfect brute, but after all she suggested&#xD;
some consolations. Money, she observed, was the great lever;&#xD;
these things would go off well at the present time, while Dr.&#xD;
Tankerville's reputation and the style in which he lived were&#xD;
fresh in people's minds, whereas in a few years, all this being&#xD;
forgotten, and new styles coming in, they would sell for a song&#xD;
I must go into society again by and by, and then I would find&#xD;
the advantage of a nice income, and of having plenty to spare&#xD;
for my toilette. In the meantime I must absolutely come and&#xD;
live with her. She would take no denial, and if I liked I might&#xD;
pay for my board, to give me more independence. I expressed&#xD;
a fear that Mr. Varick might not relish such an arrangement.&#xD;
' Oh Varick would like it of all things.'--But I should sadden&#xD;
them all by my mourning, and low spirits-I should be quite&#xD;
out of place.-' Oh! I was mistaken there-a great change&#xD;
come over her, I must know. The sad events of this summer had&#xD;
produced their due effect upon her, I might depend. She was&#xD;
no longer what she had been, I would find !' In fact, I had al-&#xD;
ready observed a slight difference in the exterior of my friend'&#xD;
her dress, though very rich, was in soberer colors, her bonnet&#xD;
(white uncut velvet with a plume) was decidedly plain, and she&#xD;
wore her hair in simple bandeaux, instead of long rinlets, as&#xD;
used to be her jaunty custom :-I had never seen Mrs. Varick&#xD;
so pathetically elegant. On making proper inquiries, I learned&#xD;
that she had been sitting under the preaching of an eminent&#xD;
Methodist in Vermont, and had experienced religion !"&#xD;
Rosemary laughed. "That's Isabel Varick to the life !" said&#xD;
she, as if involuntarily.r&#xD;
" I see you know her. Well, she took in reality Mr. O'Mor-&#xD;
ra's part, and left me convinced that his course, though cruel&#xD;
and despotic, was nevertheless dictated by common sense, and&#xD;
in a worldly point of view greatly for my interest. She did not&#xD;
say anything against Dr. Mannikin, for whom on the contrary&#xD;
she professed a special regard, and yet she contrived to let fall&#xD;
remarks that aroused me, touching his youthful antecedents,&#xD;
his having been a. 'gay young man,' and so on, and the censo-&#xD;

set down my foot here that Ezekiel's plan should be followed.&#xD;
lie ought not to be, and he should not be, with my consent, de-&#xD;
prived of the advantage of keeping my father's well-known&#xD;
stand'-to use a business word. I talked so high and so fi: mly&#xD;
to Mr. O'Morra on this point that he fairly backed out of his&#xD;
position, and let me have my own way, though the loss of the&#xD;
bonus was a bitter pill for him.--' What is the bonus to me, sir,'&#xD;
cried I, 'compared to the success of my cousin, Dr. Maninikin,&#xD;
and to the meanness of selling my father's professional eminence&#xD;
out of the family, against his own adopted professional son ! I&#xD;
will never consent to it.'"&#xD;
"You. certainly behaved well to Dr. Mannikin," observed&#xD;
Rosemary.&#xD;
"You shall 'see how he repaid me. I went to Mrs. Varick's&#xD;
at first for a visit, then to remain. Now that she had become a&#xD;
'member of the church,' and went to prayer-meetings every&#xD;
morning at 6 o'clock-for the epidemic was followed by a gene-&#xD;
ral and serious awakening in New York ; and had forsworn the&#xD;
theatre and balls, and low-necked dresses, and fancy dances,&#xD;
and subscribed to the Bible Society, and was one of the Lady&#xD;
Managers of the Moral Reform Society, and all that; nobody&#xD;
thought it was dangerous for me: to be intimate with her, or to&#xD;
become an inmate of her family. Many excellent persons&#xD;
thought, on the contrary, that I might be converted myself. I&#xD;
could not help seeing that I had got into a school of piety. The&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Craffit, Mrs. Varick's revivalist, who had come to New&#xD;
York for the winter to assist the work graciously going on there,&#xD;
talked to me in a corner of Mrs. Varick's drawing-room one&#xD;
entire evening on the state of my soul. I should make you&#xD;
laugh, and seem to be trifling with sacred things, if I were to&#xD;
tell you some things that he said to me. I had not the least&#xD;
doubt at the time that he was a very good man, yet it seemed&#xD;
to me very funny, and I shocked Isabel Varick exceedingly by&#xD;
telling her that if the man were not married, I should have&#xD;
thought that he was in love with me.-' In love with you!' she&#xD;
exclaimed. 'He is in love with all poor souls! lHe burns with&#xD;
an inextinguishable desire for your salvation: that's all !'--I was&#xD;
not more than half convinced, and an instinct that seldom de-&#xD;
&#xD;
ceives a young woman, and which a girl, who goes to Confes-&#xD;
sion, Rosemary, early learns to obey, made me avoid having&#xD;
any more conversations with the Rev. Mr. Craffi-.&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin, of course, was our constant visitor, and he&#xD;
became deeply serious--now don't laugh! It was at that time&#xD;
that he resumed partially the Quaker garb, which was then as-&#xD;
sociated in the public mind with several eminent medical and&#xD;
surgical.names. I found it quite impossible to keep my coun-&#xD;
tenance when I first saw him with a straight collar and cut-&#xD;
away coat and top-boots and knee-buckles. Somehow or other,&#xD;
though, he had contrived to give the costume a natty air; he&#xD;
never wore drab; lie compromised on black, as the less strict&#xD;
Friends do; and then his figure was perfect; he was not so lean&#xD;
and cadaverous as he is now; Isabel Varick approved the change&#xD;
heartily.-' It is for Ezekiel's interest,' she would say. 'Don't&#xD;
you see, my dear? he advertises himself wherever he goes!&#xD;
People say: who is that? and the answer is: Dr. Mannikin, the&#xD;
Quaker doctor. Thus he becomes universally known. I con-&#xD;
sider it a very good card.'&#xD;
"There was one individual of whom I necessarily saw a good&#xD;
deal, who did not partake of the general seriousness. That was&#xD;
Mr. Varick."-Rosemary slightly laughed again.--" He 'would&#xD;
not be converted, though I am afraid no one needed it more,&#xD;
Finding that I, as a Catholic, was suspicious of the genuineness&#xD;
of the work, he imparted to me very freely his own views of it&#xD;
which were not at all complimentary to the good sense or sin&#xD;
cerity of those who who professed so extraordinary an interest in&#xD;
religion."&#xD;
"Don't you think he was mistaken there ?" asked Rosemary.&#xD;
"I for one believe that there is a great deal of sincerity in these&#xD;
good people."&#xD;
"Perhaps. I was unlucky, then, to tumble into a nest of&#xD;
regular hypocrites. I really cannot tell you, Rosemary, what&#xD;
reason I have for using so strong a word. Mrs. Varick, for in-&#xD;
stance, could not have been so self-deceived as to suppose that&#xD;
she was really trying to be gool at this time. Be that as it may&#xD;
--be as charitable as you please-she did' not persevere very&#xD;
long. She fell from grace next winter certainly. Methodists,&#xD;

&#xD;
you know, believe in falling from grace. The revival passed,&#xD;
like other American excitements, and the fashionable world in-&#xD;
demnified itself by plunging deeper than ever into frivolity. It&#xD;
was about the time that I laid aside, with tears and a tender&#xD;
sorrow, my filial mourning. Mrs. Varick presided over the re-&#xD;
organization of my wardrobe, and introduced me again to society.&#xD;
She taught me how to spend my money, and as if my personal&#xD;
expenditure were not enough, being almost always short of cash,&#xD;
borrowed of me too-small sums, tens, twenties, fifties-till I&#xD;
grew alarmed at the depletion of my purse, and Mr. O'Morra,&#xD;
to whom I was forced to repair for funds, grew angry and re-&#xD;
fused to let me anticipate my income.&#xD;
"Then I was witness to some domestic scenes between my&#xD;
friend and her husband which were not very edifying. If Mrs.&#xD;
Varick was at a party almost every night, and returned home&#xD;
at one or two in the morning, or even later, her husband, who&#xD;
usually, though not always, accompanied her, had his own way&#xD;
of enjoying society, and while she was dancing and flirting, he&#xD;
was smoking, drinking and playing cards up stairs. When he&#xD;
went home with us, he was over-polite to me, alternately rude&#xD;
and over-loving to his wife, and that was his best return: for&#xD;
when he did not return with us, or perhaps had not accompan-&#xD;
ied us, he was usually carried up stairs :-I never saw anybody&#xD;
look so astonished as you do, Rosemary ! That's nothing.&#xD;
Think of the next morning's quarrel, the frightful tempers dis-&#xD;
played, the hours of sullenness : then dressing, driving, shopping,&#xD;
dining, dressing again, and the theatre, the opera, the party :&#xD;
the same eternal round ! Yet I thought I enjoyed it: for in&#xD;
spite of all the horrors of which I could not best be sensible, I&#xD;
had many partners,, some suitors, and I hoped, as I ardently&#xD;
wished, to be married-don't laugh at me for that is just the truth.'&#xD;
"It is a common case," said Rosemary, quietly.&#xD;
"But mine was not exactly a common motive, Rosemary.&#xD;
If it were, I would not perhaps acknowledge the fact so frankly.&#xD;
I had not forgotten my duties in all this dissipation, though I&#xD;
fear I much neglected them; and my idea of marriage was a&#xD;
home for Laura, not a boarding-house (the sole alternative to&#xD;
my present position) mixed up with gossiping maiden ladies&#xD;
&#xD;
and selfish old bachelors, and indolent married women; nor the&#xD;
house of a fashionable friend ; but a home for the child, my own&#xD;
house and home, where I could bring her up in virtue and sim-&#xD;
plicity, as I had been brought up. I began once more to feel&#xD;
that Mr. O'Morra's worldly wisdom had been folly, when he&#xD;
broke up our father's house, sold its household gods (so to&#xD;
speak), and prevented my keeping our family together, such as&#xD;
it was. We were three, Ezekiel and my sister and 1: Ezekiel&#xD;
my father's adopted son, as it were ; and so long as we stood&#xD;
together we should have been a respectable something, and now&#xD;
we were nothing. Ezekiel might then have turned out a better&#xD;
man, or if not, he could not have harmed us ; for the family&#xD;
bond turns poison itself into food.&#xD;
- "I used to pray that I might be married : for I saw no other&#xD;
escape from my position---."&#xD;
"In old times," interrupted Rosemary, "the place for ladies&#xD;
situated as you were, and as I am, would.be some fine old con-&#xD;
vent, as parlor boarders, where we might stay for ever if we&#xD;
liked it better. We have got boarding-houses instead: by your&#xD;
account it is no great improvement."&#xD;
"Not a bit. Well, I did not get a husband by praying for one.&#xD;
An invisible something that surrounded me prevented the right&#xD;
kind of man from approaching. It is unpardonable, I know, in&#xD;
an old maid to boast of her offers, but just in the way of history,&#xD;
I may observe that I had enough opportunities to marry if I&#xD;
could have been so contented. My suitors were of various&#xD;
sorts, but not a straight piece of wood, clear-grained and sound-&#xD;
hearted among them 'i Can you account for that.?"&#xD;
- "Not I, indeed," said Rosemary.  "I am sure there were&#xD;
plenty of the right sort in that circle then, as now."&#xD;
"So there were :-I knew some of them-at a distance."&#xD;
"And you were young, rich enough, of a good family not&#xD;
the most hideous creature that ever I saw"-with an ingenuous&#xD;
smile,-" and very agreeable. No, I don't understand it at all."&#xD;
"I dare say not," replied Miss Tankerville, slowly, and ear-&#xD;
nestly scanning Rosemary's face. "I hardly know whether to&#xD;
enlighten you or not. Why'should you know such horrors 1"&#xD;
"Horrors ?" repeated Rosemary, bewildered.&#xD;

"You have not, then, understood a word that I have been&#xD;
telling you ? It was my cousin Ezekiel and my friend Mrs.&#xD;
Varick (who, I suspect, is a cousin or something of 3 ours), who&#xD;
caused my isolation from the good and self-respecting people of&#xD;
the society we all moved in. Mrs. Varick's first prodigious&#xD;
friendship for me grew out of the face, that by visiting me she&#xD;
constantly met Dr. Mannikin. M  living with her afterwards&#xD;
gave a pretext for his incessant visits. People who knew the&#xD;
world soon found this out; and no matter whether they consid-&#xD;
ered me as the victim or the accomplice of my worthless friends,&#xD;
they naturally avoided me."&#xD;
"I am not over-quick, I hope," said Rosemary, hastily, "in&#xD;
understanding what I ought not to understand ; but you have&#xD;
said enough now to make me comprehend the relations between&#xD;
--Isabel Varick and y our cousin ; so pass over all that, I pray."&#xD;

paramour-they will shrhk from nothing, of course."&#xD;
"You have hit it now exactly, and you shall hear now what&#xD;
they did not shrink from in my case---"&#xD;
"Pardon me !" interrupted Rosemary, with apprehension.&#xD;
"I would rather not hear any details !"-&#xD;
"Fear nothing-why 3 our cheek is all a-fire !-Since you&#xD;
understand the fact, I shall not again allude to it. What you&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
A SUMMER TOUR AND A SAUCY BOY.&#xD;
WE hope that our readers are now sufficiently interested in&#xD;
Miss Tankerville, to bear a slight description of that lady's&#xD;
personal appearance, which for certain reasons we have hitherto&#xD;
abstained from giving.&#xD;
She was tall-it is the only point we have mentioned-taller&#xD;
than Rosemary, whose height was sufficient for female dignity,&#xD;
but we have not intimated yet, what was really the fact, that&#xD;
her figure was finely proportioned. She wore either black or&#xD;
very dark dresses of silk in the evening ; her gorget was gene-&#xD;
rally cut a la Pompadour, with a lace fichu, because her neck&#xD;
was like alabaster. Her dark-brown hair, which was abundant&#xD;
and glossy, but without an atom of curl, she wore in plain&#xD;
bands, disappearing behind in a large classic knot, which she&#xD;
coifed very elegantly in the evening with inexpensive ornaments&#xD;
of gold and coral. Her complexion was dark, but clear; her&#xD;
eyes nearly black ; her features regular; her mouth large but&#xD;
handsome, with very white, and beautiful teeth, which she&#xD;
showed a good deal in smiling, and the smile itself quite pecu-&#xD;
liar. It reminded Rosemary of Dr. Mannikin: it seemed a&#xD;
family trait ; but the character of Miss Tankerville's smile was&#xD;
satire. In short her face would have been eminently handsome,&#xD;
but for a too great massiveness of the chin, which detracted&#xD;
from the feminine softness of her expression. In her youth&#xD;
this would scarcely have been perceived, and even at four and&#xD;
thirty, with her admirable figure, and her great conversational&#xD;
powers, she was undoubtedly a woman of rare attractions, al-&#xD;
though it was her lot to keep a boarding-house. How this had&#xD;
come to be her lot, when she had started in life with a fine in-&#xD;
4ependence, was what excited Rosemary's curiosity.&#xD;

&#xD;
"For the reasons which I have before mentioned," pursued&#xD;
Miss Tankerville, " I was resolved to set up housekeeping for&#xD;
myself, as soon as I came of age. That you may see that this-&#xD;
was a perfectly feasible idea, I will show you what my means&#xD;
were when, soon after my twenty-first birth-day, Mr. O'Morra&#xD;
settled his account with me, as executor. I had my house on&#xD;
Broadway, which he estimated at $18,000, and $11,500 in con-&#xD;
vertible securities. The net income of this property (deducting&#xD;
taxes, repairs, &amp;amp;c.,) was $1,900. I had also the income of&#xD;
Laura's portion, till she came of age, which was about $1,800&#xD;
net: making my whole receipts exactly $3700; out of which&#xD;
for the next three years I had promised to pay Dr. Mannikin&#xD;
$1,000 a year, leaving me just $2,700, clear cash income. This&#xD;
was a much larger sum then than now, that the flux of gold&#xD;
from California has nearly doubled the expense of living in New&#xD;
York.&#xD;
"I frankly avowed my intentions to Mr. O'Morra, and some-&#xD;
what to my surprise, he approved of them highly. He merely&#xD;
advised me, as summer was already advanced, to wait till Fall,&#xD;
and in the meantime to buy a house in a suitable locality. He&#xD;
thought that I could advantageously invest $10,000 in such a&#xD;
purchase, which would still leave me $1,500 to employ in fur-&#xD;
nishing it, to which I could add about a thousand more, compris-&#xD;
ing the income of my first quarter, which lie now paid me in&#xD;
advance, and cash on hand, so that I could begin without a&#xD;
penny of debt: for $2,500 ought to furnish my house very pret-&#xD;
tily. I assure you that I felt extimely opulent, while I listened&#xD;
to all these calculations. I feared, however, that the sum he&#xD;
proposed my investing in a house was too large: it was almost&#xD;
twice as much as I had thought of.&#xD;
"'It is not a bit too much,' said he. 'Why you will be mar-&#xD;
ried before you have been at housekeeping a twelvemonth.'&#xD;
"' That's a delightful prediction!' said I, 'but I fear too good&#xD;
to come true.'&#xD;
"'Why, aren't you engaged yet ? said he.&#xD;
"' As far from.it as ever, I assure you,' said I. 'I've been&#xD;
trotting out to parties all winter, dancing till two in the morning,&#xD;
&#xD;
A SUMMER TOUR AND A SAUCY BOY.             105&#xD;
besides being dreadfully good all winter before last, o ut neither&#xD;
dancing nor praying has brought me a husband.'&#xD;
"'Well, that is puzzling,' said he, bending on me his piercing&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
I see no way to manage it, sir,' said I, laughing, I sup-&#xD;
pose, to baffle his scrutiny, 'unless I advertise in the Herald:--&#xD;
A handsome young woman, just come of age, with upwards of&#xD;
$2,500 clear income, and of good family, wishes to make the&#xD;
immediate acquaintance of a gentleman of agreeable exterior&#xD;
and good moral character, with a view to matrimony. Unex-&#xD;
ceptionable references given and required. A professional gen-&#xD;
tlenian under thirty will receive a preference !'--And I laughed&#xD;
again : for Mr. O'Morra looked amusingly serious.&#xD;
"'You read the Herald-do you ?' said he.&#xD;
"'Mrs. Varick makes her daily meditation on it, sir,' said I,&#xD;
' and often reads me the matrimonial and other amusing adver-&#xD;
tisements. It is strange people should be such fools as to ad-&#xD;
vertise for such things, isn't it?'&#xD;
"'More knaves than fools. I would advise you not to read&#xD;
such advertisements, or if you do, not to speak of them,' said&#xD;
he, with a clearing brow. 'And so you are really despairing of&#xD;
matrimony '-He smiled again.&#xD;
"'I am too indifferent on the subject to despair,' said I, 'but&#xD;
frankly, marriage does not enter into my plans for the future at&#xD;
all. All that I contemplate or desire is to have a house for&#xD;
Laura, who is getting spoiled. I shall devote myself to her&#xD;
education, and by the time it is finished, I shall be an old maid.'&#xD;
"'Rather than that should happen,' said he, with a'singular&#xD;
contortion of countenance, 'I would marry you myself.'&#xD;
I am infinitely obliged to you,' said I, and was going to&#xD;
add something very saucy ; but as Mr. O'Morra was under forty&#xD;
at that time, without a gray hair in his head, I blushed, I be-&#xD;
lieve, and concluded in a different way from that I intended, by&#xD;
saying: 'if I get quite desperate, sir, I shall know where to&#xD;
apply.'&#xD;
"lie looked very grim at this, and I would have given the&#xD;
world to take it back, which of course I neither could nor&#xD;
would, and I could not help thinking as I went away what&#xD;

afraid to-well, no matter what he was afraid to do."&#xD;
"Suppose that he had spoken more plainly, what would have&#xD;
been your answer l" asked Rosemary, with an innocent look.&#xD;

Mannikin could not comprehend Mr. 0 Morra's countenancing&#xD;
such a wild notion--' Unless,' he added, 'he means to marry you&#xD;
himself.'-Both insisted that it would hurt my matrimonial&#xD;
prospects. As I was convinced of the contrary, I was immov-&#xD;
able.-' You will expose yourself to very unpleasant remarks,'&#xD;
said Ezekiel.-' Oh!' said I,' I am not such a fool as to suppose&#xD;
that I can lve by myself, with only Laura. Of course I intend&#xD;
to get some nice widow to live with me. There are plenty&#xD;
such will be glad of the chance, thank Heaven !'-' How will&#xD;
you be better off then than you are with me ' asked Mrs.&#xD;
Varick, looking rather hurt.&#xD;
"Protest as I might, Mrs. Varick saw in my plan only a&#xD;
method of getting rid of her.-' That is ungenerous, Isabel,' said&#xD;
I, 'for I have had several opportunities of placing myself else-&#xD;
where, if to leave you was all I wanted. I could take board&#xD;
with Mrs. Passavant, in my own house, and have Ezekiel's com-&#xD;
pany ani protection; since he always resides there. It is only&#xD;
for Laura's sake. She is five years old, she quarrels with&#xD;
Roosey-that's Mrs. Varick's son, you know 'i"-" Oh! I know !&#xD;

own control, which can never be the case except in my own&#xD;
house.'&#xD;
"They saw tnat my resolution was fixed, and ceased to&#xD;
combat it. I supposed that they gave up their opposition, and I&#xD;
busied myself cheerfully in house-hunting. Having made a list&#xD;
of the houses a ivertised, I ordered a carriage and taking Laura&#xD;
with me went the rounds. At that time Bond street, Lafayette&#xD;
Place, Washington Place, were fashionable localities. So were&#xD;
still Park Place, College Place, and Broadway near the Bowling&#xD;
Green, and dear old State street. The upper part of Broadway&#xD;
from Grand street to Eighth was still highly aristocratic ; there&#xD;
lived the Hones, the Wards, the Varicks, the Costars and the like,&#xD;
in grand houses which are now fast turning into shops. Right in&#xD;
the heart of this district with aristocratic mansions of granite-&#xD;
brown stone was not yet-on either hand, stood my own house.&#xD;
In a window of its lofty granite basement was seen Dr. Manni-&#xD;
kin's name ; on the door-plate, M? s. Passavaut's. I wished most&#xD;
fervently that I could turn out Mrs. Passavant and establish&#xD;
myself there. Deducting Ezekiel's rent it would have been an&#xD;
economy.&#xD;
"Having my father's house before me as a standard, I was&#xD;
difficult to suit. Either the rooms were too low, or the hall was&#xD;
too narrow, or the yard was too small. I lotted on a spacious&#xD;
yard as a play-ground for Laura, for I did not like the idea of a&#xD;
little girl trundling her hoop in the street, which they all do&#xD;
now. By Mr. O'Morra's advice I deferred choosing till I re-&#xD;
turned to town in September, for the summit r was advancing&#xD;
and all the world was going to watering-places. Mrs. Varick&#xD;
was going to Rockaway, as Dr. Mannikin recommended sea-&#xD;
bathing for Roosey. It was easy for him also to drive down&#xD;
occasionally and fee the child, who was under his professional&#xD;
care. Roosey, you know, had rickets. Of course, Mrs. Varick&#xD;
proposed that I should accompany her, and take Laura, but I&#xD;
was a little surprised that she did not insist upon it very strongly,&#xD;
and provided I engaged to return to her in the Fall, seemed quite&#xD;
Willing I should spend my summer anywhere I liked. Dr. Man&#xD;
nikin, declaring that watering-places were stupid, unless the&#xD;
bathing was necessary for your health, and inveighing against&#xD;

A SUMNER TOUR AND A SAUCY BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
the customs of bathing at Rockaway, advised me to go to the&#xD;
Catskill mountains aid take board in some farm-house, where I&#xD;
could have fresh cream and milk, al)d save money 'to begin&#xD;
housekeeping,' for I would be sure to need it. I proposed a&#xD;
tour to Niagara, but he objected tue expense, and besides, how&#xD;
could I manage about company? I could not fasten myself&#xD;
upon a party without some gentleman to take care of me: and&#xD;
to travel with a child five years old ! Laura would be an end-&#xD;
less anxiety, and in all probability she would get into the Falls,&#xD;
there or at Trenton, and be drowned.&#xD;
"Although the clue to Ezekiel's conduct was entirely wanting&#xD;
to me, I had sense enough to suspect very often an ulterior mo-&#xD;
tive, as well as to observe that Mrs. Varick and he were always&#xD;
playing into each other's hands. 1 wondered, therefore, why ho&#xD;
did not want me at Rockaway, why he wished to send me into&#xD;
the recesses of the Catskill away from all the world, and why&#xD;
he objected to my spending a few hundreds in a summer tour:&#xD;
for if I joined a party who were going to make what was then&#xD;
the grand excursion, to the Falls, down the St. Lawrence, Mon-&#xD;
treal, Quebec, and the White Mountains, it would not cost me&#xD;
more: and the health, the pleasure, the mental improvement&#xD;
to a young lady in my position, was worth that. Mr. O'Morra&#xD;
to whom I applied for advice, warmly approved the tour. ridi-&#xD;
culed Dr. Mannikin's objections: as for a gentleman escort, he&#xD;
would accompany me himself, if my friends would allow him to&#xD;
join their*party ; and by all means take Laura along, for al-&#xD;
though she might cause some trouble and anxiety, I would feel&#xD;
still more in leaving her; and if it should be desirable at any&#xD;
point to separate from my friends, her presence would always&#xD;
save me from embarrassment."&#xD;
"Mr. O'Morra is a gentleman !" said Rosemary, emphatically.&#xD;
"From the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, miss !&#xD;
But you never saw anybody in such a rage as Dr. Mannikin.&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra and he hated one another cordially: if I had not&#xD;
known that, I should have deeply resented the remarks which&#xD;
Ezekiel thought proper to make, in his quality of my nearest&#xD;
relative. Although he had himself pointed out the necessity o&#xD;
my having a masculine escort of my own, unless I meant to&#xD;
&#xD;
inflict an unreasonable burden on the gentlemen of the party I&#xD;
was to join, who had other ladies to look after, he affected to&#xD;
consider that my own and my sister's guardian was not a suitable&#xD;
person for that cffice.--'I suppose it will quite sufficientiy-&#xD;
explain our relative position, Ezekiel, when Mr. O'Morra intro-&#xD;
duces us as his wards, when 1 introduce him as my guardian.'--&#xD;
' Which he is not, at present, any more. than I am !'-' But he&#xD;
is guardian of my sister, joint guardian with myself!' said .--&#xD;
'You had better make a joint concern of it altogether, and the&#xD;
whole world will be of the same opinion after you have been&#xD;
travelling with your guardian all summer-a widower under&#xD;
forty ! He means to take Rory along of course; but if I were&#xD;
you, I would insist upon the ceremony before starting ! That's&#xD;
all I have to say.'"&#xD;
"Oh! exclaimed Rosemary, with an impatient gesture and a&#xD;
look of fire. "I could---.."  She did not say what she could&#xD;
do: doubtless something very disagreeable to Dr. Mannikin.&#xD;
"I resented this speech of course, though not so much as I&#xD;
should have done, had I not thought it supremely ridiculous;&#xD;
and Mrs. Varick came to Ezekiel's assistance by laughing at&#xD;
him. He made an apology too, by saying that it was his affec-&#xD;
tion that made him over-anxious for my interests and my honor ;&#xD;
the simple truth being that he was afraid this journey would&#xD;
lead to my marr3 ing either Mr. O'Morra or somebody else, when&#xD;
my property, which he meant if possible to appropriate, would&#xD;
escape his clutches: to say nothing of the very convenient cover&#xD;
which I afforded to his wicked passion, and which was incom-&#xD;
parably the greatest injury that I suffered at his hands.&#xD;
"I made the journey. Providence seemed to grant me that&#xD;
consolation before what I was to suffer. I knew not why, an&#xD;
incubus was lifted from my spit it when I found myself on the&#xD;
Albany boat-for there was no Hudson River railroad then---&#xD;
with Laura, Master Rory (a boy of eleven), Mr. O'Morra, and&#xD;
our travelling party. It was Rory's vacation, and his father&#xD;
would not deny him or himself the pleasure of the boy's com-&#xD;
pany ; he took care of Laura like a little knight; the manliest&#xD;
little fellow ever you saw ; not so very little either, for he was as&#xD;
tall as most lads at twelve, could ride and drive, dance, skate,&#xD;

-to be entrusted with a real gun, which his father promised him for&#xD;
his next birthday present  They all said that he saved Laura's&#xD;
life on one occasion by his courage and presence of mind; the cool-&#xD;
est little rascal that ever wore roundabout; and it is needless to&#xD;
say that she was as much in love with him as a little girl of five&#xD;
years commonly is with a boy just old enough and big enough&#xD;
to afford her effectual protection in her small needs and terrors,&#xD;
on a tedious journey.&#xD;
"It was not a tedious one to me. It was the only time that&#xD;
I ever saw society fairly as a young lady. Mr. 0' \l orra was&#xD;
widely known, and we met everywhere people or the highest&#xD;
consideration themselves who considered him highly. At Sara-&#xD;
toga, where we spent a week, I had a delightful time. At twenty-&#xD;
one you know what that means for a young lady. I received a&#xD;
great deal of attention, found myself a belle in fact, made a&#xD;
serious conquest, and refused an offer of marriage between two&#xD;
glasses of Congress water on the last morning of our stay. I&#xD;
had refused or prevented such offers before, it is true, but this&#xD;
was the first by which I felt honored, and it seemed to me that&#xD;
a cloud was taken off my life. I attribued it to the fact that I&#xD;
was in a young woman's normal position once more, under the care&#xD;
of her rightful protectors and engaged in her legitimate duties.&#xD;
I 'doubt very much if this gentleman would have noticed me at a&#xD;
party; it was Laura who won me his attention. Two months&#xD;
before I would have instantly accepted such an offer ; now that&#xD;
I breathed the pure air of virtue and happiness, I was more&#xD;
difficult. Mr. O'Morra, I saw, was charmed with me: he knew&#xD;
all about it from my suitor who, with a manliness that engaged&#xD;
my esteem,,had asked his permission first, and informed him&#xD;
afterwards of his want of success."&#xD;
"Why did you refuse this gentleman ?" asked Rosemary.&#xD;
" Is it why I refused him ?" said Miss Tankerville, in a sweet&#xD;
Hibernian accent, which she called her 'mother tongue,' from the&#xD;
source whence it came.-" Because his nose was too short, per-&#xD;
haps, or I didn't like the color of his beard, or the cut of his&#xD;
coat, or he was a Yankee, or a Protestant, or perhaps his name&#xD;

was Hezekiah! Is it necessary to give reasons why a girl of&#xD;
one and twenty, rich, handsome and happy, rejects a god offer ?&#xD;
Tell me, if you can, the reason why she should accept the first&#xD;
good one, or the second, or the third, for that matter ? At five&#xD;
and twenty the case is altered : if she refuse then, she has grave&#xD;
reasons ; at thirty she will scarcely refuse at all; past thirty,&#xD;
she will probably not have any offers to refuse. Stick a pin&#xD;
there, Miss Rosemary !"&#xD;
"Stick a pin ?" said Rosemary, with a puzzled look, and&#xD;
involuntarily glancing down at her dress, "where ?"&#xD;
"Set it down in your tablets, my dear; imprint it on your&#xD;
memory. It is a metaphorical phrase, used by vulgar people;&#xD;
a slang expression, in short."&#xD;
"I don't wish to learn slang expressions," said Rosemary,&#xD;
half petulantly : "so pray proceed."&#xD;
"Why what a little princess it is ! To p oceed then.&#xD;
"I stood where you will never stand, on Table Rock, which&#xD;
quivered, or seemed to quiver, with the thunder-stroke of the&#xD;
great cataract. Over the sweep of the horse-shoe, the waters&#xD;
of Lake Erie plunged in sheets of. swiftest green and fretted&#xD;
white into that vast rock-bedded cauldron of foam and spray&#xD;
spanned by the sun-bow. The faint and lovely arch rested its&#xD;
further' limb. against the verdure of Goat Island, veiled in softest&#xD;
mist. Eternal uproar ! Quiet ineffable, which no sound nor motion&#xD;
can disturb! Table Rock has fallen, and never broke the trans-&#xD;
cendent repose of the mighty scene. I held Laura's hand fast&#xD;
in mine, and was perfectly unconscious that my guardian had&#xD;
passed his round my waist, and held it firmly. Rory stood in&#xD;
his blue roundabout and cap on the very edge, as quietly as&#xD;
Napoleon is painted on the rock of St. Helena. If I had seen&#xD;
him at first, I should have screamed, but his father only looked&#xD;
at the boy, and then pointed out to me his position with a glance&#xD;
of paternal pride, which overcame even a father's apprehensions&#xD;
"I remember this scene so well-I so often recalled it. It came&#xD;
back to me in my dreams for weeks and months after. In one&#xD;
sense, you know, the relative situation of Mr. O'Morra and my-&#xD;
self justified a parental familiarity on his part: but then that&#xD;
was the sole instance of it, before or since; and although it is a&#xD;

natural, almost an irresistible impulse to seize hold of your&#xD;
friends on Table Rock 0 Morra was not a man of impulses.&#xD;
His very bitter ness and passion as an orator are deliberate; his&#xD;
finest bursts are calculated ; and-he never indulged that perfectly&#xD;
natural, perinissible, quasi-parental caress without a clear per-&#xD;
ception of what he was about.&#xD;
"Did he mean it just paternally? Was it in the character of&#xD;
an ex-guardian? In a widower under forty, that seemed to me&#xD;
a mere impertinence to a girl of my age. Yes; when I con-&#xD;
sidered Mr. O'Morra's raven hair, his clear, unwrinkled, and&#xD;
noble brow, the fire of his gray eye, his mobile lip curled&#xD;
with sarcasm, his spare but muscular frame which, tall as I was,&#xD;
overtopped me a full head ; and remembered that he was scarce&#xD;
past the term of youth, which, as my father used to tell me, Hip-&#xD;
pocrates fixed at thirty-five; I was profoundly convinced that a&#xD;
parental familiarity on his part to me, in the full bloom of my&#xD;
twenty-one summers, was a pure impertinence: and Cabal&#xD;
O'Morra was incapable of an impertinence. What then? I&#xD;
affected fear, and drew back from the edge of Table' Rock."&#xD;
"I think," said Rosemary, innocently, as if she had made a&#xD;
grand discovery, which reflected great credit on her penetration&#xD;
"I think-you must have been in love at this time with Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra."&#xD;
" Ah ! now, Rosemary, you make me blush !" said Miss Tan-&#xD;
kerville, with her peculiar smile, which we have noticed : and&#xD;
Rosemary looked ashamed, as if she had been caught saying&#xD;
something foolish.&#xD;
"We sailed down the St. Lawrence ; we visited the Canadian&#xD;
French in their homes, and worshipped in their rural churches.&#xD;
Montreal in August greatly captivated us all. As none of us&#xD;
had ever been abroad, the Church of the Sulpicians, which tra-&#xD;
vellers generally style the Cathedral, was the most imposing&#xD;
edifice devoted to our faith that we had ever seen. It chanced&#xD;
that the first morning we visited it there was a marriage with all&#xD;
the ceremonies; a nuptial mass, du ig which the bridegroom&#xD;
and bride, both young, communicated together on the steps of&#xD;
the altar, as directed by the ritual of our Church. We all stayed&#xD;
to see it through. Though a Catholic born, I had never before&#xD;
&#xD;
A SUMMER TOUR AND A SAUCY BOY.              113&#xD;
seen it, and our friends were Protestants. It was a very inter-&#xD;
esting affair, for the groom was an English officer, a convert (as&#xD;
I understood), and the bride French. His scarlet uniform, and&#xD;
her long white train and veil, blending together on the altar&#xD;
step, before the priest in his rich vestments, while little surpliced&#xD;
boys like angels held tapers on either side, or knelt where they&#xD;
had recited the confiteor, formed a beautiful picture. I was so&#xD;
affected that I wept.-' Unless I can be married that way,' said&#xD;
I, as we left the church, 'I don't want to be married at all.'-&#xD;
'Scarlet coat and-all, I suppose V asked Mr. O'Morra, sarcasti-&#xD;
cally.-'No, sir,' said I, with spirit, 'British officers who are&#xD;
Catholics are too scarce for me to hope that ; and were they not,&#xD;
I am too patriotic to marry any but an American. But as I am&#xD;
entitled to the ring, sir, and all that, I mean to have it with all&#xD;
solemnity or not at all.'&#xD;
"Mr. O'Morra looked very cold and stern at that. I could&#xD;
not at first imagine why. Then I recollected that he was a wi-&#xD;
dower, had been married in early youth, to a virgin bride, and&#xD;
no doubt with the very same cer'emonies; and I remembered to&#xD;
have heard that it was only by a kind of dispensation that the&#xD;
Church permitted these ceremonies to be used in the second&#xD;
marriage of widowers, and not at all (as I knew vei y well) in that&#xD;
of widows. I thought more about this than about the parental&#xD;
caress he gave me at Niagara. I had lately felt a profound in-&#xD;
ternal conviction that Mr. O'Morra was tenderly attached to me,&#xD;
and that nothing but some subtle and delicate scruple prevented&#xD;
him from saying so at present. It is impossible to convey to&#xD;
any one else the grounds I had for this conviction, which' had&#xD;
stolen over me gradually, awakening all the time deeper and&#xD;
stronger feelings of affection for him: and now I got a sudden&#xD;
shock. It seemed to 'me that a gulf had opened between us.&#xD;
It was possible clearly, to bridge it over ; but it was a question&#xD;
whether he would after all ask me to cross on such a bridge; it&#xD;
was a further question, whether I would consent. Strange to&#xD;
say, I had never before thought of it in this particular light.&#xD;
That mysterious ceremony in the Church of the Sulpicians-that&#xD;
bride kneeling on the very steps of the altar, where I never saw&#xD;
woman kneel before-had awakened in the depths of my soul a&#xD;

and question.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE PLOT THICKENS.&#xD;
"PAsT midnight !" said Miss Tankerville, looking at her&#xD;
watch.&#xD;
" Oh, never mind !" cried Miss Rosemary, flushed with a deep&#xD;
and permanent excitement. "I am dying to know why you&#xD;
didn't marry, Mr. O'Morra after all, why you are an old maid-&#xD;
not that you are so very old either-and-what dreadful thing&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin and Mrs. Varick did to you."&#xD;
Instead of answering, Miss Tankerville bent her head in a&#xD;
listening attitude. Like most housekeepers of the timid sex,&#xD;
she was quick-eared.&#xD;
"I hear a step on the stairs !"&#xD;
"Dear me ! I hear steps on the stair every night !" said&#xD;
Rosemary.&#xD;
"Aye! but I know the step of every one of my boarders, and&#xD;
this is entirely different."&#xD;
Miss Tankerville rose with excitement and rushed to the door&#xD;
which she threw open. The sound, which was approaching&#xD;
from below, ceased, but she could not see who it was, for the&#xD;
gas in the hall had been put out. While sne ran to the mantel&#xD;
for a match, the steps retreated. She lit a burner of the side&#xD;
light near Rosemary's door and flooded the hall and nearest&#xD;
flight of the stair with light. While thus engaged, the front&#xD;
door of the hall below opened, causing a draught that flickered&#xD;
the flame, then closed again.-" Some one has gone out !"-Miss&#xD;
Tankerville went down stairs, accompanied by Rosemary, who&#xD;
shared her excitement. They relit the hall light, examined the&#xD;
hall door, which Miss Tankerville locked and bolted. Then they,&#xD;
ranged through the parlors, trying windows, looking into&#xD;
closets, and locking all the doors after them, to make sure noth-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing should escape. Convinced at last that there was no one&#xD;
inside, both returned to Rosemary's room. After discussing&#xD;
femininely this incident, Miss Tankerville resumed her narrative,&#xD;
"If you wish to know why I refused Mr. O'Morra, on his first&#xD;
offer, of which Rory had forewarned me, it is very easily ex-&#xD;
plained. He was a widower, near forty, and I a girl of twenty-&#xD;
one, independent, supposed by myself to be tolerably attractive;&#xD;
and his son, a lad of eleven years, was averse to his father's re-&#xD;
marrying. I think I was right too: for why had Providence&#xD;
made me independent, if not that Imight never sacrifice what&#xD;
is more delicate and noble in my sex to vulgar necessities or&#xD;
worldly ambition'' Then I had Laura to bring up. I was a&#xD;
mother already, you see; and for that reason resolved to remain&#xD;
a virgin, to fulfil, in unselfish purity, my allotted task. \My&#xD;
feelings were not those of a Religious at all-for more than one&#xD;
blameless passion struggled hard against my decision-why&#xD;
should I deny that, now that the man's locks are silver and the&#xD;
fire of his glance is tamed'? We parted at Mrs. Varick's door,&#xD;
at about six in the morning, after a night on the Sound-a glo-&#xD;
rious moonlight-that witnessed my struggle and my triumph;&#xD;
parted friends: Rory shook hands with me in his manly style,&#xD;
and kissed Laura with bold affection. I don't suppose the child&#xD;
herself had any idea why, after they were gone, I sate down on&#xD;
my trunk in the hall, flung my arms round her and cried !"&#xD;
"You were a good girl," said Rosemary, dashing away a tear.&#xD;
"I understand all that part now perfectly."&#xD;
" The Varicks had not returned from Rockaway : that is,&#xD;
Mrs. Varick and the children had not; for Mr. Varick was in&#xD;
town. Although Mr. Varick was always particularly kind to&#xD;
me, it was not entirely agreeable to be in the house with him&#xD;
alone, as it were, with only a child and the servants, especially&#xD;
as he used to come home tight, when he came home at all in&#xD;
hours that I knew anything about. I regretted to observe that&#xD;
his habits had in no respect improved, and the observation sti-&#xD;
mulated the resolution with which I had returned to the city,&#xD;
of forming a home as speedily as possible for myself and Laura.&#xD;
Mr. Varick told me that Roosey had been delicate all summer,&#xD;
and that Dr. Mannikin had attended him, spending sometimes&#xD;

&#xD;
entire weeks at Rockaway. For his own part, business&#xD;
had kept him in town a great deal. Whatever the business&#xD;
was, it had not been very profitable, for Mr. Varick borrowed&#xD;
money of me on the first morning of my arrival. Three or four&#xD;
days after, he applied to me again, wishing to borrow a very&#xD;
large sum only for four-and-twenty hours. The whole of my&#xD;
August rents and dividends, and the greater part of those paid&#xD;
in May, were deposited then to my credit in the Chemical Bank,&#xD;
I used to keep my check-book in my table drawer, and I was a&#xD;
little surprised that the sum Mr. Varick asked for-merely for&#xD;
one day-was within a few dollars the exact amount of my&#xD;
balance. I was very confiding, but to lend even for a few hours&#xD;
almost half a year's income, startled me, and I refused. He&#xD;
looked mortified, but said nothing, put on his hat and left the&#xD;
house. That day he did not appear at dinner-he had dined&#xD;
with us every day since our return-and I feared that he was&#xD;
very much hurt by my want of confidence. I sate up a good&#xD;
deal later than usual that evening, in order to see him, hoping&#xD;
that he might return sober enough to hear my excuses. However&#xD;
he never came, and what was very unusual, did not appear at&#xD;
breakfast the next morning. Another entire day, and no news&#xD;
of Mr. Varick ! We all thought that he had gone down to&#xD;
Rockaway. I was writing a note to Isabel, informing her of&#xD;
the circumstances, and begging her to return home, when a&#xD;
short letter arrived from her to me, begging me to send her a&#xD;
hundred dollars to pay her bill at Rockaway, as Varick took no&#xD;
notice of her request, and she supposed that as usual he had&#xD;
been losing terribly at play. I enclosed her a cheque imme-&#xD;
diately. and the next evening she returned, escorted by Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin, and accompanied by the children and two maid-&#xD;
servants. She flung herself into my arms. As soon as we&#xD;
were alone, she said: 'Good Heaven! we are ruined, Helen!&#xD;
Varick has gone to South America, leaving gaming debts&#xD;
unpaid.'&#xD;
"Mr. Varick had been in difficulty some years before. Then&#xD;
he received a considerable inheritance on the death of his grand-&#xD;
father, old Peter Roosevelt Varick. He had not been in busi-&#xD;
ness since, but had lived on his means, speculating in real estate,&#xD;
&#xD;
and dabbling in lotteries. Lately he had taken to faro. Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin told me that his notes had been flying about all sum-&#xD;
mer at fabulous discounts, sustained at all merely by the wealth&#xD;
of hia relations, who, some might suppose, would step in at the&#xD;
last, and by the idea that his wife was going to receive a large&#xD;
property from her uncle Dashon. The house in which they lived&#xD;
was a gift from old Mr. Dashon to Mrs. Varick, and was settled&#xD;
on her in the hands of trustees. The furniture, too, was hers-&#xD;
a gift from her uncle-of course it was liable for judgments,-&#xD;
but as Varick had no bona-fide business obligations, nothing but&#xD;
the wildest kind of accommodation paper negotiated at the most&#xD;
usurious interest, and gambling debts, there would be no suits,&#xD;
aid hence she would not be disturbed. But here were all her&#xD;
resources. She had no money, and there were bills to pay.&#xD;
The butcher and grocer would give no further credit till theirs&#xD;
were settled, and but for my purse we should have had no din-&#xD;
ner, that week.&#xD;
"As soon as we had fairly ascertained how matters really&#xD;
stood, a grand tripartite council was held, consisting of Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin, Mrs. Varick and myself, to consider what was best&#xD;
to be done. I advised her to apply at once to her Uncle&#xD;
Da hon.&#xD;
"'Now, Helen,' she began, 'it's of no use saying that. Uncle&#xD;
Dashon will tell me to let my house, store my furniture, and&#xD;
come to live with him, as I did before my marriage, and till&#xD;
after Roosey was born. I can't do it. I'm  not going to put&#xD;
myself under aunt Dashon's thumb again, I can tell you. And&#xD;
if I refuse, uncle Dashon never forgives people who ask his&#xD;
help and won't take his advice. Better not ask it at all. I&#xD;
stand very well with him now, and if Dick gets killed fighting&#xD;
in Algiers--as I hope to' goodness hgmay'-Rosemary stamped&#xD;
her charming foot and uttered an indignant exclamation !-'no&#xD;
doubt I shall get uncle's entire property at last. But as for&#xD;
returning under his roof, it would do me no manner of good,&#xD;
and I will not do it unless from the most dire necessity.'&#xD;
pt would separate her from .us all!' said Dr. Mannikin,&#xD;
Pathetically.&#xD;
"I'I don't-see what she can do, then,' said I, 'unless she- lets&#xD;

the house and sells the furniture, which will give her an income&#xD;
sufficient to board in a very handsome style,'&#xD;
"'Let the house of course I must,' said Isabel. 'I have not&#xD;
the means to live in it. But as for selling the furniture-uncle's&#xD;
gift only two years ago-he would never forgive me !'&#xD;
"Ezekiel proposed (without any seriousness) that she should&#xD;
keep both house and furniture, and take boarders.-' You could&#xD;
make a handsome thing of it, and uncle Dashon would rather&#xD;
like your spirit.'&#xD;
"'There would be such an outcry among the Varicks as never&#xD;
was heard in New York before. They'd consider it infinitely more&#xD;
disgraceful than my husband's not paying his debts ! No use&#xD;
talking of that!'&#xD;
I see,' said Dr. Mannikin, "that you are determined to&#xD;
keep up appearances ',&#xD;
"'Determined.!' said Mrs. Varick.&#xD;
"'Then in one shape or other your furniture,' said he, looking&#xD;
round the frescoed saloon, gay with French mirrors and satin&#xD;
upholstery and gilded carving-' has got to be converted into&#xD;
support-that's clear.'&#xD;
"' I don't know what is to become of me, unless Helen comes&#xD;
to my assistance,' replied she, bursting into tears.&#xD;
"'What can I do t' I exclaimed. 'Tell me, and I will do it.',&#xD;
"At that time I would almost have laid down my life for this&#xD;
woman who, when my sister and I were orphans and homeless,&#xD;
had so disinterestedly (as I thought) offered us a refuge. Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin drew me into the next room--an exquisite dining-&#xD;
room with everything carved in oak, rich antique buffet, chairs&#xD;
all knops and flowers, &amp;amp;c.--and proposed. a. plan which he&#xD;
thought would solve every objection, and promote alike the hap-&#xD;
piness and interests of all t us.&#xD;
"'Mrs. Varick's own idea is,' said he, 'tnat as you are bent&#xD;
on housekeeping, you should take this house, furniture and all,&#xD;
and pay her partly in money-for she will want some, you&#xD;
know-and partly in board : but I tell her you can't afford it.&#xD;
The rent is more than you can pay.'                    -}&#xD;
"' Entirely out of the question,' said I.&#xD;
"'Here is a more practical plan. Your own house bears the&#xD;
&#xD;
same rent as this, but as you would let the basement to me at&#xD;
a high price, you could afford to live in that, and taking Mrs.&#xD;
Varick's furniture at a low figure, pay her in board, while she&#xD;
would l)rovide for her other expenses by the rent'of this house.&#xD;
"'You forget, Ezekiel, that Mrs. Passavant has a five years&#xD;
lease.'&#xD;
"'Not at all. That's the very point. Mrs. Passavant has a&#xD;
fine opportunity to take a large family mansion in Lafayette&#xD;
Place, where she thinks she can make her fortune in a few&#xD;
years, and she only hesitates because she has your house on&#xD;
her hands, Say the word and you shall have it.'&#xD;
"' I shall be delighted to get my father's house again, and to&#xD;
give you the office and have you live with me, cousin Ezekiel,'&#xD;
said I; 'but can I afford to buy this costly furniture at any&#xD;
decent price? And to take Isabel with her two children (and&#xD;
servants-she must have a nursery-maid--and her own maid, of&#xD;
course)-I shrink ! Besides what will her uncle Dashon say to&#xD;
her selling the furniture ? He won't like her selling it to me&#xD;
better than to any one else!'&#xD;
"He need never know it, or if'he does'-for I shook my head&#xD;
resolutely at that-' he can be told, what will be the truth, that&#xD;
it is only hypothecated as security for her board till her hus-&#xD;
band's return. Of course, you would resign it to her on full re-&#xD;
payment of her bills-eh ? Thus, she unites every object she&#xD;
avoids an elat, keeps up appearances with her relations and&#xD;
the world; and you refurnish your house more splendidly&#xD;
than ever on the easiest terms, and at the same time secure the&#xD;
presence of a matron, which has always been your diiculty,&#xD;

timate friend, with whom I had lived for two years on sisterly&#xD;
terms, and the man my nearest relation, this view appeared pru-&#xD;
dish, and I did not allude to it. I referred the proposal hack to&#xD;
Isabel herself, who of course had already agreed upon it with&#xD;
Ezekiel in private. She, therefore, only s1oke to thank me&#xD;
eagerly, and promised the easiest bargain that ever was about&#xD;
the furniture. In fine, I consented, provided Mr. O'Moi era's&#xD;
consent could be obtained. At this condition Ezekiel's brow&#xD;
blackened. He observed that Mr. O'Morra was in Washington,&#xD;
conducting a cause in the Supreme Court. 'I will write to him,'&#xD;
said I. ''We shall get the answer in three days.'&#xD;
" I wrote the letter, which Dr. Mannikin took to put in the&#xD;
Post-office."&#xD;
"Oh !" exclaimed Rosemary. " What a fool !"&#xD;
"I waited a week without receiving an answer; Ezekiel&#xD;
coming every day to inquire, and growing very impatient and&#xD;
pressing with me to decide. At last he brought a message from&#xD;
Mrs. Passavant, requiring an immediate answer about the lease,&#xD;
as she wag obliged either to accept or decline the proposal made&#xD;
to her. Thus pressed and interpreting Mr. O'Morra's silence as&#xD;
a sign that he was resolved not to interfere father in my affairs,&#xD;
I gave my consent.&#xD;
"DDr. Mannikin now hurried every thing, urging the prudence&#xD;
of getting Mrs. Varick's furniture out of her own hands as soon&#xD;
as possible. I bought it, therefore, immediately, taking her&#xD;
receipt for the very considerable sums which I had already lent&#xD;
her, as the first payment, and contracting to board her, her two&#xD;
children and as many maid-servants, for three years, giving them&#xD;
an entire floor, with fuel, lights, use of the drawing-room, and&#xD;
all other imaginable privileges, at a very handsome compensa-&#xD;
tion no doubt. The contra =was reduced to writing, and signed&#xD;
by us both. Ezekiel witnessed it. He figured up what the&#xD;
bargain would cost me in cash, and found that 1 should get the&#xD;
furniture at about one-third its original value, the rest being&#xD;
paid entirely in rent and supervision, which, however useful to&#xD;
Mrs. Varick, would cost me nothing. He was never weary of&#xD;
dilating on the advantages to accrue from the arrangement. I&#xD;
was going to be mistress of a splendid establishment, and at the&#xD;

same time their common benefactress. He confessed that he&#xD;
had not succeeded at all in the two years since my father's&#xD;
death. He had even lost some families who at first employed&#xD;
him. They regarded him either as a bachelor, or as separated&#xD;
from that cursed wife of his, who was born to be the blight of&#xD;
his existence. Now that he was going to live with two young&#xD;
ladies-his cousins--idaughtera of his old and celebrated uncle,&#xD;
Dr. Tankerville-all would be changed. lie proposed to order&#xD;
a new door-plate with his own name-for the front door.&#xD;
"'Really cousin Ezekiel!' said I. 'Doesn't that turn me into&#xD;
your housekeeper at once V&#xD;
"'Fie,- no, cousin Helen. It is merely for the sake of the&#xD;
good effect it will have upon my practice--the position it will&#xD;
give me!'&#xD;
"'To pass off my house as yours--is that it ' said I.&#xD;
"Why you wouldn't put Miss TANKERVILLE on the door.-..&#xD;
as if you kept a boarding-house--iwould youV&#xD;
"'No, you can't do that, Helen!' said Mrs. Varick, laughing.&#xD;
'Just think--on Broadway-too conspicuous a place for you to&#xD;
hang out your sign, my dear ! The most natural thing in the&#xD;
world for you to give your cousin the doctor the benefit.'&#xD;
"So to give Ezekiel the benefit, I agreed to it, and before we&#xD;
moved in, the name of DR. MANNIKIN appeared-on a large silver&#xD;
plate upon the lofty green door. - This was an immense lift in&#xD;
the world for Ezekiel Mannikin! Consider what a respectable&#xD;
figure he now cut, living in a four-story house, with granite&#xD;
basement and massive steps, on- Broadway ! If you called on&#xD;
him, you were shown into a noble office, two rooms deep, lined&#xD;
with walnut bookcases and a magnificent medical library.&#xD;
Every circumstance breathed the old-established practitioner&#xD;
Daily, at the hour when Broadway was most thronged, Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin would be seen, .entering or issuing from his office in&#xD;
faultless suit of black, Quakercut, broad-brim hat, white-top-&#xD;
boots; a sort of Quaker dandy, neither ashamed of the Society&#xD;
nor superstitiously attached to it, and fast becoming a most res-&#xD;
pectable notoriety.&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin's motives for desiring this arrangement were&#xD;
quite patent. Mrs. Varick's were not so clear-.---."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6853-00000064"/>&#xD;
"Oh, never mind her motives," interrupted Rosemary. "One&#xD;
must have read history to little purpose not to know that peo-&#xD;
ple, under the influence of criminal passions, will go any lengths&#xD;
and run any danger to gratify them. Otherwise Isabel Varick's&#xD;
conduct is inexplicable, for had she applied to-to her uncle&#xD;
Dashon, he would have done anything for her at that time."&#xD;
"The lessons of history have made a deep impression upon&#xD;
you," said Miss Tankerville, with a smile. '" To dismiss, then,&#xD;
the motives of Mrs. Varick. Immediate possession of the pre-&#xD;
mises had been a condition which Ezekiel made with Mrs. Pas-&#xD;
savant: so she moved into her new house without even waiting&#xD;
to clean it. Dr. Mannikin wanted me to do the same, but I was&#xD;
too thorough a housekeeper, and not yet sufficiently tamed to&#xD;
obey him there. I must have kept him on tenter-hooks, while,&#xD;
regardless of his advice, which I considered a pure impertinence;&#xD;
I sent in an army of painters and house-cleaners. Once in for&#xD;
it, I was resolved to do the thing as became the daughter of Dr.&#xD;
Tankerville. Mrs. Varick's carpets had to be taken up, purified,&#xD;
new breadths put in and refitted, causing fresh delays. Her&#xD;
rooms were narrower than mine, so that the drawing-room had&#xD;
to have a new medallion-carpet, one which I thought would not&#xD;
disgrace her French mirrors and Paris upholstery. I had been&#xD;
overseeing it laid down; the mirrors being already up, and the&#xD;
curtains, and pictures, but not another stick of furniture'yet&#xD;
moved in. My father's and mother's portraits by Inman, and&#xD;
a great picture of Hippocrates, which old Pafl persuaded my&#xD;
father to buy, and a silvery landscape by Doughty--white-armed&#xD;
sycamores overhanging a running stream chrystalline clear-and&#xD;
a purple and gold sunset by Cole, adorned the walls, giving&#xD;
already a familiar look, and I looked round with a sense of&#xD;
pride to think I was mistress here once more, when the door&#xD;
opened, and Cabal O'Morra stood before me.&#xD;
"In the mirror that had been Mrs. Varick's I saw the blood&#xD;
rush tumultuously to my face. It was only a minute--I ran up&#xD;
to him to shake hands. He took mine icily and gazed round in&#xD;
silence, his frock-coat buttoned up, and his gloved hand resting&#xD;
on his hip.&#xD;

"'That explains why I never got it'&#xD;
"'Sir!' said I, flaming up.&#xD;
"Your cousin is to live with you, or you with him? I see&#xD;
his name on the door-plate. Who else V&#xD;
"'My friend Mrs. Varick, sir, who is compelled to relinquish&#xD;
her house for the present.  I wrote to you about all these&#xD;
arrangements asking your approval and advice.'&#xD;
"My approval is out of the question. My advice is to break&#xD;
the bargain at any cost.'&#xD;
Sir, it is too late. Had you said as much a month ago, in&#xD;
answer to my letter, I would not have stirred hand or foot in&#xD;
the business..&#xD;
"Confound the letter!' said he, stamping with his foot, and&#xD;
usinoa much more forcible word. 'I never got it, I tell you,&#xD;
nor,do I believe it was ever sent.'&#xD;
"'Please not to swear, sir,' said I: 'I am not used toit. As&#xD;
for the imputation upon my cousin, that he has had the baseness&#xD;
to suppress my letter, I shall not notice it.' I was excessively&#xD;
angry, and vent to the mirror to adjust my hair and bonnet, as&#xD;
if about to go. Mr. O'Morra strode up and down the room,&#xD;
in equal wlath; once he turned to the door; then he stopped&#xD;
before my father's portrait and sighed. He came back to me&#xD;
and took my hand.&#xD;
" 'iGod forbid.' said he, 'that I should stand on idle etiquette,&#xD;

risking her fortune, her happiness, her reputation and perhaps&#xD;

on the subject, had I not found you bent on this housekeeping&#xD;
project, which I thought an excellent mode of withdrawing from&#xD;
her. I even supposed that you intended it so, and hence I did&#xD;
not explicitly warn you. Besides you know what hopes I&#xD;
formed upon your summer tour.    Had those presumptuous&#xD;
hopes turned out better founded, I had planned for you a visit&#xD;
to my mother this autumn---'&#xD;
"Here Mr. O'Morra stopped, overcome by emotion, and for&#xD;
my part I listened pale as death, wondering what was to come&#xD;
next.&#xD;
"'That was out of the question after what passed between us&#xD;
in our last conversation. Still, I wrote you from Washington,&#xD;
urging you to pursue your housekeeping plan, but to keep clear&#xD;
of all connection with your cousin, and hinting why.'&#xD;
"' I never received such a letter '&#xD;
" Ah, it is all of a piece. Yesterday I returned. On my table&#xD;
I found a letter informing me of your plans-not your letter--&#xD;
an anonymous letter--'&#xD;
"' Sir !' said I, 'Mr. O'Morra ! an anonymous letter ! Oh, no;&#xD;
I beg of you, sir, not to say another word. I would rather incur&#xD;
any disgrace than listen to anything from so base a source.&#xD;
Against the reputation of a lady too! 'Fie, flie!'&#xD;
"I walked away impatiently.&#xD;
"'You should hear me out,' said he. 'I regard these things&#xD;
exactly as you do. I will not even mention to you the charges&#xD;
contained in this letter. But as it concerned you so nearly, I&#xD;
thought it right to make inquiries in the quarter indicated. I&#xD;
have been to  Rockaway. Now weigh what I am going to tell&#xD;
you ! It is certain. Both your cousin and Mrs. Varick know of&#xD;
the scandal: for Varick was informed, and questioned them both,&#xD;
and accepted their explanations as satisfactory. In the face of&#xD;
that fact, which should impose on them such peculiar discretion,&#xD;
they form a plan to live together, dung her husband's absence,&#xD;

"'Is that all l' said I. ,&#xD;

"It is enough to have prevented my forming this engage-&#xD;

now. I have signed a written contract with Mrs. Varick ; I&#xD;
have bought her furniture ; it ie hers no longer, it is mine; her&#xD;
house is let from the First, I must move out of it in twenty-four&#xD;
hours, and she has no place to come but here. The arrange-&#xD;
ment is generally known, and for me to draw back at the&#xD;
present moment would be to disgrace her, Mr. O'Morra.'&#xD;
Tier own fault entirely.'&#xD;
"' She has not used me well, I admit, but I utterly disbelieve&#xD;
that scandalous, story. Do you think me so deficient in pene-&#xD;
tration that there could be any grounds for such idle talk and I&#xD;
not know it ?&#xD;
I wouldn't give five straws for your opinion in such&#xD;
matters,' said he with unbounded contempt.&#xD;
"'I shall not desert her when she is traduced,' said I warmly.&#xD;
"Take care of yourself and Laura-you have no call to pro-&#xD;

you of your contract and every other embarrassment, before the&#xD;
world is a day older.'&#xD;
"I drew away from Mr. O'Morra, and leaned against the man-&#xD;
tel--for there was not a seat in the room-to reflect. At last I&#xD;
asked him-more for want of something to say, than any other&#xD;
view-what he would do if I gave him full powers.&#xD;
"'In the first place, serve Dr. Mannikin with a notice to quit&#xD;
the premises in a week. He is a tenant at will. I can prove&#xD;
that he pays no rent and never has paid any. I could set him&#xD;
on the sidewalk with all his traps to-morrow. Next with this&#xD;
notice as a screw, I am prepared to treat with'Mrs. Varick. I&#xD;
will offer to return her furniture anywhere she pleases, or to&#xD;
pay her cash for it in full, at a fair valuation by disinterested&#xD;

yourself as-my betrothed wife.'&#xD;
"No words can express the mingled respect, passion and ener-&#xD;
getic wilfulness, with which O'Morra uttered these last words:&#xD;
it was enough to sweep away the opposition of any feminine will&#xD;
in the world. A man of forty, who knows his own power, is far&#xD;
more formidable to our resolutions than a youngster, Rosemary.&#xD;
He would make us marry him in spite of ourselves, and be ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
tremely well contented afterwards, I believe. But I was his&#xD;
match in pride, and man as heris"-observed Miss Tankerville,&#xD;
triumphantly-" more than a match for him in dissimulation.&#xD;
I could not bear that any man should say I accepted him to get&#xD;
out of a scrape; so I turned away with a breaking heart-for I&#xD;
felt to my inmost core all the noble devotion of his conduct-&#xD;
and said: 'Thank you a thousand times.'-I raised my eyes&#xD;
from the carpet and saw in the mirror his look of doubt--as&#xD;
plainly as if he had said with his lips-' She thinks me too old'&#xD;
for her !'-Why don't these wise men know us better?  I was&#xD;
only ashamed to yield without a stronger urgency. So the main&#xD;
put on his hat and went away, leaving me alone in my grand&#xD;
house. With much ado I kept from running to the window to&#xD;
call him back : maiden pride prevented me."&#xD;
Young Rosemary clasped both hands over her face with a&#xD;
beautiful movement of modesty, then with a sidelong glance and&#xD;
half smile said: "Go on."  They are all alike. The child un-&#xD;
derstood it, as the duckling understands paddling about in a&#xD;
pool.&#xD;
"Suppose all that Isabel Varick said in answer :-her pro-&#xD;
testations, her tears, her wounded feelings, her bold denials,&#xD;
taking Heaven to witness of her innocence and praying God&#xD;
might strike her dead that instant if she spoke not true. The&#xD;
Rockaway rumor she treated as the most idle gossip, such as&#xD;
no woman on earth could be exempt from, and which, with as&#xD;
little reason, might any day assail myself. From mere innocence&#xD;
she had attached no importance to it, which from me won instant&#xD;
credence. I ended by feeling the greatest compunction for&#xD;
speaking of it at all, and almost feared that I had compromised&#xD;
my own character by having listened with any respect to so&#xD;
monstrous a calumny. When she saw the effect she had pro-&#xD;
duced, she changed her tone. If I thought I should sustain the&#xD;
slightest injury, she released me from my engagement. A word&#xD;
from me was sufficient-she would tear the contract into a&#xD;
thousand pieces. With difficulty I appeased her wounded de-&#xD;
licacy.&#xD;

my old home restored, would be untrue. In some respects it&#xD;
was the happiest period of my life. Dr. Mannikin was a singu-&#xD;
larly agreeable companion; above all, at table. He had seen so&#xD;
much and had so large a fund of anecdote. He brought to the&#xD;
house many amusing and celebrated people, editors, authors,&#xD;
artists, actors, and Bohemians generally. Our winter evenings&#xD;
at home were rendered delightful by this sort of society. We&#xD;
went to the opera and theatre frequently, and I had little sup-&#xD;
pers at home thereafter, to which some witty actor or renowned&#xD;
and social man of letters would be invited. We were not in-&#xD;
vited to so many parties-some of Mrs. Varick's friends left her&#xD;
off their visiting list, and I was included in the proscription-&#xD;
she for boarding, I for taking her to board. To make amends&#xD;
we attended some very brilliant public balls, where Isabel was&#xD;
always distinguished for her grace, her beauty, and her ravish-&#xD;
ing toilette. I had also enough of domestic cares. I got a&#xD;
governess for Laura, a remarkably nice young person, and I&#xD;
badher taught music and dancing bycompetent professors. I&#xD;
was present at her lessons, and attended myself to her religious&#xD;
instruction. There was one great drawback--I could not invite&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra to the house: he would have deemed it an insult;&#xD;
and this always rankled in my mind, although I was more and&#xD;
more convinced of the injustice he had done to my cousin and&#xD;
my friend.&#xD;
"Another thing I did not quite enjoy was the expense. The&#xD;
family was pretty large; Dr. Mannikin was an epicure, and we&#xD;
entertained quietly indeed, but pretty often, dinner company.&#xD;
I sustained the whole establishment; for though Dr. Mannikin&#xD;
paid me nominally $1,000 a year, the money, you observe, came&#xD;
out of my pocket. I merely retained the pension I previously&#xD;
gave him. Mrs. Varick, of course, paid me nothing: for I was&#xD;
all the time paying her for her furniture. At the end of six&#xD;
months I had exhausted all my reserve, and saw that my ex-&#xD;
penditure would' regularly exceed my income. I was now&#xD;
fairly in for it, and seeing that I could not lop off anything with-&#xD;
out pinching my table or doing injustice to Laura, by the advice&#xD;
of Dr. Mannikin, that Fall I let two furnished rooms, with&#xD;
breakfast, to a couple of literary gentlemen, Mr. Forrester, who&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PLOT THICKENS.                  131&#xD;
is still with me, and a young, foreigner named Ruse. To do&#xD;
this, however, was to exhaust the capacity of my house: I had&#xD;
not a spare room left.&#xD;
Let me tell you (there is reason for it) how my space was&#xD;
disposed of. In the first place we had five female servants, and&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin kept a black boy to drive his carriage: for t had&#xD;
lent him money to set up a handsome brougham with two&#xD;
® horses: Mrs. Varick said that Ezekiel ought to have that, to&#xD;
match the house. I had also a sempstress, whom I did not&#xD;
consider exactly" as a servant.  She and Fleurette (rsabel's&#xD;
own maid) occupied the same room in the attic, and the rest of&#xD;
the girls and the boy, occupied all the remainder. There was&#xD;
a counter basement under the front office. This was the sewing&#xD;
room and servant's hall :-the rest of that floor was occupied by&#xD;
the kitchen, laundry, store rooms, and so forth. The base-&#xD;
ment was Dr. Mannikin's office-he slept in the back room, on&#xD;
a sofa-bedstead of his own invention. The extension-room was&#xD;
thelinintg-room. Over it, accessible from the first landing of&#xD;
the back-stairs, the old billiard-room had been converted into&#xD;
two pieces, of which one was Laura's school-room, and the other&#xD;
the bed-room of her governess. First floor--the drawing-room&#xD;
Spite, consisting of two large saloons, communicating by folding&#xD;
doors, and a small boudoir (over the hall) fitted as a ladies' work-&#xD;
room and library : no sleeping apartment on this floor. Second&#xD;
floor (Americans would call it the third)--Mrs. Varick's apart-&#xD;
ments; her sitting-room, bedroom, Roosey's room, a dark-room&#xD;
where the nurse slept, four in all, with closets, and bath-room&#xD;
affected to her alone, Third story (in New York parlancehe&#xD;
fourth), Miss Tankerville's room,rand Laura's adjacent; which&#xD;
left precisely two .rooms corresponding in front for Messrs.&#xD;
Forrester and Rush : deep closets between, cut off from the&#xD;
apartment of sail messieurs, and appropriated to herself by the&#xD;
young lady who owned the house and almost everything in it.&#xD;
I have hardly left a corner for a mouse. Yet the rent paid by&#xD;
my new lodgers did not suffice to meet the deficiency in my&#xD;
income as compared with my expenses: for it was I who fed&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin's horses, and paid his boy's wages and kept his&#xD;
carriage in repair. What didn't I do?  I didn't pay the wages&#xD;

of Mrs. Varick's maids, nor her milliner's bills, nor those of Dr.&#xD;
Mannilin's tailor: but if we went to a party together, I paid the&#xD;
carriage hire afterwards: Dr. Manniim, however, bought the&#xD;
tickets when we went to the theatre. He considered that that&#xD;
balanced the account.&#xD;
"I was, I own, deeply alarmed when, at the end of the second&#xD;
year, I found myself, after my November rents had been paid,&#xD;
with a debt exceeding my cash-in-hand by a cool $1,200 aid not&#xD;
a stiver to go on with. Well, I had some Chemical Bank shares;&#xD;
I got my certificates, drove down to Wall street, went straight to&#xD;
Mr. Nevins' office, came back with a cheque, paid my debts to&#xD;
the last dollar ; then resolved to economize.&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin was now doing well in his profession. The&#xD;
appearance of wealth sustained for two years had done its work.&#xD;
I ought to know, for his bell was always going. I thought in my&#xD;
heart that if he did not relinquish the $1,000 which I yet had to&#xD;
pay him for one year more, according to my promise, he might&#xD;
at least refund the various sums I had lent him over and above&#xD;
that, and also relieve me of the expense of his stable and boy.&#xD;
I told him so frankly. He readily promised to do so, and that was&#xD;
the last I heard of it. He used to market for me (to increase&#xD;
his own consequence) and paid both my butcher's and grocer's&#xD;
bills. I was glad to be saved the trouble ; and to tell the truth,&#xD;
I was so youthful-looking-so completely a young lady in&#xD;
appearance-that it often annoyed me to make purchases for&#xD;
the house. Everybody called me 'Miss,' at first, and then very&#xD;
likely, when I gave the house, changed it to 'Mrs. Mannikin'&#xD;
-a most odious appellation to me. The bills used to be made&#xD;
out against Dr. Mannikin, and he, when he had paid them, of&#xD;
course with funds that I furnished him, would carefully file&#xD;
them away. He observed that these fellows might 'come down'&#xD;
upon him some day. Well, the only item I could succeed in&#xD;
retrenching was wine. I quietly locked up my store-room, and&#xD;
the doctor, after a laughing quarrel on'the subject, got some&#xD;
wine for his own use, and Mrs. Varick and he drank it at din-&#xD;
ner. It passed as a jest, but produced bad feeling.&#xD;
"I approach with trembling the conclusion of this history.&#xD;
What led to it was that Miss Smith, Laura's governess, with&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PLOT THICKENS.                 133&#xD;
whom I was entirely satisfied, who had been with me now foL&#xD;
two years, and was, as I believed, tenderly attached to her&#xD;
charge, as well as to me, suddenly, without any reason as-&#xD;
signed, gave up the situation. When I pressed her for her&#xD;
motive, asking if I or any one in the house had given her cause&#xD;
of complaint, she would only answer that she could not be&#xD;
happy here, and ended by a flood of tears.&#xD;
"'Now tell me,' cried I, 'who has dared to annoy or insult&#xD;
you? For if it were the best man or woman in the house, he&#xD;
or she shall leave it.' -ue&#xD;
"'No one, Miss Tankerville--no one, I assure you. Every-&#xD;
body has been and is most kind to me.'&#xD;
"I saw there was some mystery. Was she going to&#xD;
ried ? Was she married already?  What then?   At last the&#xD;
poor girl, after makg me promise never to bet     the&#xD;
was the author of the information, told me. I could not&#xD;
and did not believe her. I would see with      o    n&#xD;
I soon had abundant proof. The deepest darkness discre-&#xD;
tion the most absolute, cannot forever hide the guilty. That&#xD;
gliding serpent form--I see it still creep by in the dark-that&#xD;
stealthy step on the winding stair-I hear it yet. The long&#xD;
garments do not rustle--she is too careful: no slipper creaks--&#xD;
she is barefoot. That woman is capable of committing other&#xD;
crimes than this one day, when cupidity, or vengeance, or some&#xD;
darker passion yet, shall prompt her.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
THE CROWNING VILLAINY.&#xD;
"You understand what I have been telling you, Rosemary 3"&#xD;
" Sufficiently," replied the y oung girl. "Excuse me for ask-&#xD;
ing if it is not possible that you were mistaken ? Such mon-&#xD;
strous ingratitude on the part of Dr. Mannikin-such infamy&#xD;
in one bearing the name Isabel Varick bears,'and that which&#xD;
she bore before her marriage,-appear to me incredible."&#xD;
"For your sake I touch the evidence 1nhtly-hiuting rather&#xD;
than describing. I pass over my visit to Isabel's own room&#xD;
during her absence-her children and nurse buried in a sleep&#xD;
so profound that the influence of drugs could alone account for&#xD;
it. I see your astonishment: but Miss Smith's slumbers had&#xD;
been deepened in the same method by a soothing draught pre-&#xD;
scribed by Dr. Mannikin for her cough.' She slept like the seven&#xD;
sleepers after it, but it affected her nervous system so much&#xD;
that without Dr. Mannikin's knowledge she omitted it; hence&#xD;
her part in the denouement. The nurse-a healthy buxom Irish&#xD;
girl as ever you saw, scarce sixteen, s offered in the same way.&#xD;
Two y ears later I placed her in an asylum, a wreck. She is now&#xD;
restored, and waits on you daily. Question her, if you doubt.&#xD;
Besides the wicked are never so secret as they deem. There&#xD;
was Fleurette--she had eyes and ears too in her French head,&#xD;
and a French tongue to relate her observations. Fleurette slept&#xD;
with Rhoda, the sempstress ; Rhoda, the sempstress, sometimes&#xD;
talked with Miss Smith, the governess. Long before they ame&#xD;
to live with me, in the revival winter, this shame began."&#xD;
" Enough ! enough !" cried Rosemary, with a gesture of&#xD;
deprecation.&#xD;
"It only remains to decide upon the course I should pursue.&#xD;
Outraged modesty, injured pride, wounded affection, the sense&#xD;
of ingratitude, of betrayal, abhorrence, resentment, indignation,&#xD;
~~:Y&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
contempt, overcame and-banished at once every kindly feeling&#xD;
that I once had entertained for either. At the same time justice&#xD;
to myself required that I should seem entirely ignorant of every-&#xD;
thing, and rest my action on entirely different grounds from the&#xD;
real one.&#xD;
"The next morning, then, at the family breakfast I announced&#xD;
that I head determined to break up housekeeping. My manner&#xD;
was so serious that the announcement caused a general start.&#xD;
Mr. Forrester and Rus6, who for some time had been admitted&#xD;
to the common table by unanimous vote, expressed lively regret.&#xD;
So little was my motive suspected that Dr. Mannikin, supposing&#xD;
it was the pecuniary difficulty again, immediately offered to&#xD;
'double' (as he expressed it) his board, in other words to pay&#xD;
me in fact what hitherto he was only reckoned to pay me.&#xD;
"'I can afford to do it now,' said he, filling his glass with&#xD;
some delicate Chateau Margaux. 'Come, cousin Helen ! that&#xD;
will add a thousand a year to your income at once.'&#xD;
"There was a general smile-for everybody knew exactly&#xD;
how Dr. Mannikin paid his board,&#xD;
"' I'm not so rich as you,.Mannikin,' observed Forrester ; 'I&#xD;
can't afford to double my board ; but'-turning to me-' if a&#xD;
very handsome rise, Miss Tankerville, will enable you to go on&#xD;
command me. I'd be confoundedly sorry to see this family&#xD;
broken up-wouldn't you, Rus6 ?'&#xD;
" Mr. Rus6 expressed the same sentiment, but added:-&#xD;
'Miss Tankerville must remember that she is receiving part of&#xD;
her income in the shape of har furniture. In less than a year&#xD;
all this beautiful establishment will be entirely yours, Miss He-&#xD;
len, and I think there is not in the city one more elegant. It is&#xD;
unique.'&#xD;
" That's true, Helen,' said Mrs. Varick, reaching out her&#xD;
lovely arm for some buckwheat cakes. 'It's I who ought to be&#xD;
thinking what I'll do when the 3 ear is up, unless my husband&#xD;
digs a fortune out of those new gold mines in California where&#xD;
he writes me he's going.'&#xD;
"'I have nothing to complain of,' said I, 'nor do I complain.&#xD;
Since I have cut offt my wine bills and a few other little extras,&#xD;
and have takern Mfr. Forrester and Mr. Ruse as full boarders, I&#xD;

am not running behindhand any more. I certainly would not&#xD;
allow you to raise your board, gentlemen, though I thank you&#xD;
for the cffer. I appreciate too, I assure you, the pleasantness of&#xD;
the family, and of every member of it--you may rely upon it&#xD;
that no one will feel more keenly than I shall the pain of part-&#xD;
ing: but part we must.' My voice trembled and broke in spite&#xD;
of my self.&#xD;
"' Very sorry, Miss Tankerville,' said Forrester. 'How soon&#xD;
do you propose V &#xD;
"'There will be a bill on the house to-day, and if I can let it&#xD;
from the first of January, I shall do so.'&#xD;
"' Indeed you will do no such thing, Helen!' said Ezekiel,&#xD;
rising from the table.&#xD;
"'The house is mine, cousin Ezekiel. I am free to let it it&#xD;
I choose.'&#xD;
"'You will not violate your contract with Mrs. Varick, I&#xD;
conclude!'&#xD;
"' That,' said I, 'is a matter between Mrs. Varick and my-&#xD;
self.'&#xD;
" ' Well, Helen ?  And how do you intend settling it V de-&#xD;
manded Isabel herself, flushing up. 'You are almost a whole&#xD;
year's board in my debt!'&#xD;
"'My successor and tenant,' said I, 'will of course complete&#xD;
the time for me; or, if you prefer it, I will pay you the money&#xD;
instead.'  -&#xD;
"'Neither the one nor the other is the same thing to me, by&#xD;
means,' she replied. 'The money I won't accept at all,&#xD;
as for the other proposition, it is a mere evasion !'-.-And she&#xD;
hung out of the room with a look l can never forget. Her&#xD;
femitd penetration or accusing conscience divined the truth at&#xD;
once. Miss Smith also slipped away, terrified (I think) by a&#xD;
glance of frowning inquisition which Dr. Mannikin directed at&#xD;
her, and betraying her consciousness by the very act.&#xD;
" Forrester-a mild-mannered man as ever lived, a giant in&#xD;
stature and bearded like a pard, yet gentle as a woman-began&#xD;
to reason with Dr. Mannikin in favor of Miss Tankerville's right&#xD;
to decide such a question according to her own interests and&#xD;
feelings. Still he regretted her determination in view of the&#xD;
&#xD;
fact that Mrs. Varick considered she had claims. He could&#xD;
understand that. For his own part, if everything else remained&#xD;
the same, and Miss Tanker vile were left out, it would no longer&#xD;
be the same to him. Without prejudice to Mrs. Varick, who&#xD;
was a very charming person, no doubt; or to Mrs. Varick's&#xD;
furniture (now Miss Tankerville's), which was extremely re-&#xD;
cherche and elegant; Miss Tankerville herself was the charm of&#xD;
her own house, and he hoped they should be able to induce her&#xD;
to recognize that fact and to alter her resolution. Rus6--a&#xD;
slight, pale, fair-haired young man, with keen, light-blue eyes,&#xD;
and a beautiful light-brown mustache-looked from one to an-&#xD;
other in his foreign-bred manner, but said nothing. I liked&#xD;
Rus6 very much, though Mrs. Varick had taken an intense dis-&#xD;
like to him. He had rigorous foreignideas of feminine decorum,&#xD;
and was scrupulously observant of every form of respect to us&#xD;
ladies. Isabel said he was dissipated, and preferred Forrester&#xD;
greatly, who certainly was much more liberal in his notions.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin had introduced them both into the family, and I&#xD;
used to think it odd that he, a man who was nothing (as I sup-&#xD;
posed) to either of us, seemed to be jealous of them both, of&#xD;
Forrester (that I barely tolerated) in relation to me, and of Rus6&#xD;
in reference to Mrs. Varick, who could not bear him at all.&#xD;
"When Forrester had finished complimenting me, I answered&#xD;
"'Gentlemen,' I said, with all the sweetness I could put into&#xD;
my manner, 'my position is somewhat peculiar for the mistress&#xD;
of such a family as this. I am a young unmarried woman, and&#xD;
as such I have both interests and feelings which are sacred to&#xD;
myself, and of which I will render account to nobody. It is&#xD;
sufficient for me to say that I choose not to keep a boarding-&#xD;
house any longer. and that .I don't expect any one to inquire&#xD;
into my motives.'-And with that I too swept out of the room."&#xD;
"That," said Rosemary, "was capital !"&#xD;
"Before I got out of the lobby, a servant opened the door&#xD;
again, and I overheard Dr. Mannikin say with an oath-' I do&#xD;
believe she is going to get married!'&#xD;
"Miss Smith was resolute to leave me. She was afraid that&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin, if he suspected that all was discovered, would&#xD;
poison her to destroy her testimony. Considering the difficult.&#xD;

ies I had before me, I was not sorry to let her go, and I felt&#xD;
that Laura too would be an embarrassment. Moreover I would&#xD;
not allow the child to remain in the house a single day longer,&#xD;
for fear she might come to the knowledge of that which I would&#xD;
not have had her know for the world. So I went immediately&#xD;
to Madam Commifaut's, at whose fashionable school I had my-&#xD;
self been educated, and placed Laura under her care. The&#xD;
school was in Houston street, only a few squares distant; I&#xD;
could visit the child daily, and I knew that I could rely impli-&#xD;
citly on Madam s kindness to my little sister, then nearly eight&#xD;
years old. This step convinced every one that I was in earnest,&#xD;
and confirmed the idea that I was meditating matrimony.&#xD;
"From Madam Commifaut I went straight to Mr. O'Morra,&#xD;
whom I wished to consult in regard to the legal effect of my&#xD;
contract with Mrs. Varick, and the steps I needed to take to&#xD;
get rid both of her and Dr. Mannikin. I took him a copy of&#xD;
the contract.&#xD;
"'Hem!' said he, regarding me steadily, although I had not&#xD;
intimated my reasons for wishing to break up, until my face&#xD;
consciously burned under his scrutiny. 'This instrument is&#xD;
equivalent to a lease of the apartment here designated, for three&#xD;
y' ars ; and I see it has eleven months to run. Of course you&#xD;
are bound by this rigorously ; and as she is in possession, you&#xD;
cannot dispossess her. You must also supply her with board,&#xD;
fuel, lights and other things here enumerated, to the end of the&#xD;
time, or forfeit your title to all the consideration, that is, the&#xD;
furniture : a cunningly devised instrument!'&#xD;
"'Then I am at her mercy altogether V&#xD;
"'Not at all-for by fulfilling the conditions your title is per-&#xD;
fected, and since it is for necessaries of her position, is good&#xD;
even against her husband ; and in five days after you may show&#xD;
her the door.'&#xD;
"'No earthly consideration will induce me to remain another&#xD;
month, much more eleven, under the same roof with her,' said I.&#xD;
"' Is it so V said he, with a terrible eye-flash. 'Then begin&#xD;
by serving a notice to quit on Dr. Mannikin. He is a tenant at&#xD;
will. All you have to do is to give him a month's notice, and if he&#xD;
fail to vacate the premises on the day appointed, the sheriff will&#xD;
&#xD;
put him into the street. The woman will follow of her own&#xD;
accord probably.'&#xD;
"'Very well, sir,' said I, not raising my eyes from the floor,&#xD;
'please serve the notice on Dr. Mannikin to-day.'&#xD;
C 'I will write it,' said he, 'and you shall deliver it. In the&#xD;
meantime you can advertise your house as you propose, and put&#xD;
a bill on it; and if Mrs. Varick finally refuse all accommoda-&#xD;
tion, and insist on the letter of the bond, you can make it a&#xD;
part of the conditions with your tenant to board that lady and&#xD;
her family till next November. You should get a tenant who&#xD;
is willing to buy the furniture out and out, and who will give&#xD;
security to fulfil your engagement to Mrs. Varick as part pay..&#xD;
meant. I think you will have no difficulty in finding one, as it is&#xD;
an excellent situation for a fashionable boarding-house. Mrs.&#xD;
Varick is a very fashionable lady too-she will give the house&#xD;
a character at once!'"&#xD;
"Your Mr. O'Morra is too bitter !-I don't half like him."&#xD;
"'If you can,' he concluded, 'compromise with her. Pay&#xD;
her anything in reason--three--four-thousand dollars.down, to&#xD;
give up the contract and move out. Or let her take her cursed&#xD;
furniture and begone, and do 3 ou offer to pay the cartmen for&#xD;
moving it.'&#xD;
"The idea of a compromise was in my own mind, and as a preli-&#xD;
minary to it I paid another visit to the broker's. Mr. Nevins&#xD;
met me with a half-reproachful smile. 'What! going to sell&#xD;
more stock already, Miss Tankarville ? I fear you are extrava-&#xD;
gant ; and I hear that you take boarders too? What is that for?'&#xD;
--I confessed it was a folly, but assured him that I was cured of&#xD;
it. Several gentlemen who had been conversing with him,&#xD;
looked round at the name of Tankerville ; a handsome pleasant&#xD;
Jew came forward and took my hand, saying-' The daughter&#xD;
of my old friend Dr. Tankerville V 'Mr. Nathan, I believe?'&#xD;
said I.--' If  ou are selling Chemical,' said he with a smile, 'I&#xD;
will take it of you. A friend of mine, Mr. Dashon, who has&#xD;
more money than he knows what to do with, ordered me to buy&#xD;
all the Chemical I can lay hold on. I will give you one quarter&#xD;

certificates, and be filled up a cheque from one of the little&#xD;
packs ever ready on hooks above the desk used for that pur-&#xD;
pose.-' And so you remember me?' he said.- Perfectly, Mr.&#xD;
Nathan.'-' Ah, your father and I were old friends. I used to&#xD;
buy a great many stocks for him. He was too fond of Insur-&#xD;
ance- burnt his fingers in '35 that way. How is it you are still&#xD;
Miss Tankerville ? In our church a young lady with your she-&#xD;
kels, and half your beauty, would have lost the power of signing&#xD;
her'own name to bank certificates long ago '--Mr. Nathan in-&#xD;
sisted on sending out a boy to get the cheque certified, and&#xD;
meanwhile chatted with me about my father. All the gentlemen&#xD;
in the office saluted me when I retired, with that respect which&#xD;
says so much to a young woman. 'After all,' thought I,' I am&#xD;
only three and twenty-I am independent-I have good man-&#xD;
ners-my share of beauty-and an unspotted hereditary name&#xD;
-why shouldn't I yet do well when I have cut myself adrift&#xD;
from my fatal cousin and my false friend?'&#xD;
"Much the same reflection did I make when I went to the&#xD;
bank to deposit the cheque I had received. It was past two,&#xD;
there was quite a string of depositors waiting their turns, and&#xD;
as it was not very agreeable for a lady to take her place in a&#xD;
line of young clerks, I went into the cashier's office. Mr. Des-&#xD;
doity placed a chair for me with punctilious cordiality, and&#xD;
taking my bank-book-'Selling more stock, Miss Helen? For&#xD;
that, I take it, is the meaning of Mr. Nathan's cheque. Are&#xD;
you going to buy a little more real estate ? Well, it is better !'--&#xD;
And the old gentleman took the book himself to the teller, had&#xD;
the entry made, and brought it back to me. He told me a&#xD;
pleasant anecdote of my father, accompanied me to the door of&#xD;
the bank and handed me into the carriage. 'So much,' thought&#xD;
I, 'for bearing an unsullied name!'&#xD;
"During my absence the house-agent had already put a bill&#xD;
on the house. I could see where it had been: for Dr. Man-&#xD;
nikin had torn it down in a rage.&#xD;
"' I'll not have a bill on the house while my name is on the&#xD;
door,' said he. 'It is an insult to me. If you want to let the&#xD;
house, I will take it.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"' Yoa cannot afford to live under such a rent, cousin Ezekiel,'&#xD;
said I.&#xD;
"'Perfectly well afford it--allow me to understand my own&#xD;
interest.'&#xD;
"'I shall expect my tenant to take the furniture off my&#xD;
hands.'&#xD;
"'Of course-I am ready to do that--on your own terms.'&#xD;
"'That is all very well to say, cousin Ezekiel, provided I am&#xD;
satisfied with the security.'&#xD;
"'You shall have ample security. Here is your father's&#xD;
library--I will mortgage it, and the furniture itself: that's&#xD;
enough, I hope. I will engage to fulfil the unperformed part&#xD;
of your contract with Mrs. Varick, and she will give up the&#xD;
contract accordingly-that's fair. I will do anything in reason ;&#xD;
but put a bill on the house you shan't.'&#xD;
"'Do you mean to say, cousin Ezekiel, that I shall not put a&#xD;
bill on my own house if I choose V&#xD;
"' I do, while I am the tenant in possession, of which my&#xD;
name on the door is prima facie proof.'&#xD;
"I rang the bell. A servant appeared.&#xD;
"'Hand this letter to Dr. Mannikin,' said I.&#xD;
"He took it mechanically and broke it open. After a glance&#xD;
he threw it into the fire.&#xD;
"'It is a notice to the doctor,' said I, 'from my lawyer, to&#xD;
quit the premises in thirty days ?--do you understand that,&#xD;
Mary ?'&#xD;
"' Yes, ma'am,' said the girl, with a terrified look.&#xD;
"'You may go.' She darted off. 'I shall not quarrel with,&#xD;
you, cousin Ezekiel, about the bill, but you cannot prevent the&#xD;
house being advertised, and if there is any interference on your&#xD;
part with the servants showing it to persons who call at the&#xD;
hours designated, I will soon show you whether I am its mistress&#xD;
or not by calling in the police.'&#xD;
"My father's blood was boiling in my veins with the anger&#xD;
and contempt that I hardly suppressed. He seemed cowed.&#xD;
"What is thy motive, Helen, for such a step at this momentI&#xD;
Wert thou about to marry, I could comprehend it.'&#xD;
" ' My motive, Ezekiiel-if you must know it-is a very sim-&#xD;

pie one. Mrs. Varick, as well as yourself, has lost my esteem,&#xD;
and I cannot longer live under the same roof with either.'&#xD;
"'This is extraordinary language,' answered he, reddening&#xD;
violently. ' I insist on knowing precisely what it signifies.'&#xD;
"My answer was prompt and crushed home. like a cannon-&#xD;
shot. It was too frank, no doubt, for an unmarried girl, but my&#xD;
blood was up, and I could not stand on trifles. He gave me a&#xD;
look of horrible and cowardly malignity, accompanied with that&#xD;
death's head smile which lately began to play over his sinister&#xD;
features.&#xD;
"'Say that again,' he hissed out, 'and I will kill you.'&#xD;
" ' You won't kill me,' said I bitterly, 'for you would have to-&#xD;
hang for it, and you value your precious neck too much to&#xD;
place it in jeopardy.'&#xD;
"'Servants' gossip!'&#xD;
"'No, Dr. Mannikin ! Nothing short of the testimony of my&#xD;
own eyes could have convinced me of the reality of such double.&#xD;
dyed treason, guilt and infamy.'&#xD;
'"You conclude from mere indiscretion to 'guilt.'&#xD;
"'All I know of such guilt, sir, is that such indiscretions are&#xD;
conclusive proof of it, and I desire to know no more.'"&#xD;
"That," said Rosemary, admiringly, "was a noble and maid-&#xD;
enly reply."&#xD;
"War was now declared. There were incessant conferences&#xD;
between Mrs. Varick and Ezekiel. The former refused to listen&#xD;
to any proposition of mine to compromise her claim, unless I&#xD;
would give Dr. Mannikin a lease of the house for a term of&#xD;
years. Meanwhile I was soon left entirely alone with them and&#xD;
the servants ; for Messrs. Forrester and Rus6, pursuant to my&#xD;
notice, took apartments with Mrs. Passavant. Then occurred&#xD;
a move of Mr. O'Morra's, which seemed to render the breach&#xD;
irreparable. A very handsome woman, but pale, shy and half-&#xD;
frightened, presented herself one morning with a letter of&#xD;
introduction from him, which announced her simply as Mrs.&#xD;
Grace, a lady actually keeping a small boarding-house in Brook-&#xD;
lin, and desirous of trying her fortune on a larger scale in New&#xD;
York. Mr. O'Morra added that if we could come upon terms&#xD;
he would be security to an'j amount (underscored) for Mrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Grace's performance of her contract. I was very much pleased&#xD;
with her, showed her the house from garret to cellar, except&#xD;
Mrs. Varick's apartments-for that lady was so disagreeable on&#xD;
these occasions that I avoided troubling her. Mrs. Grac seemed&#xD;
equally pleased with the house--didn't care to see Mrs. Varick's&#xD;
rooms-was quite willing to board that lady and her family in&#xD;
part payment for the furniture, which she was prepared to pur-&#xD;
chase entire-and agreed without haggling to the price which I&#xD;
had caused to be estimated by an appraiser. I was quite&#xD;
delighted with so reasonable a tenant, and one, despite a few&#xD;
peculiarities of accent and some grammatical solecisms, so lady-&#xD;
like. I told her that letting-the house under the circumstances&#xD;
that I did, leaving in it a lady of very delicate and aristocratic&#xD;
breeding, to be provided with board by my successor,. I felt&#xD;
bound to satisfy myself that the general character of a first-class&#xD;
house would be maintained, so that Mrs. Varick should have&#xD;
no reason to complain either of the table or the persons whom&#xD;
she might meet there, and with whom she would be compelled&#xD;
in a certain degree to associate.&#xD;
"'That's very right and proper, ma'am,' returned Mrs. Grace,&#xD;
and those are just my own idears about the house. It is to be&#xD;
A No. 1 in all respects-I understand that. I believe you have&#xD;
a right to give Mrs. Varick a private table, if you choose, in her&#xD;
own apartments ? It is what I would do, and then she couldn't&#xD;
complain of her associates, nor I neither !'-And Mrs. Grace&#xD;
smiled. 'As for her table,.she must be hard to please, if I don't&#xD;
please her there: for she shall oider what she likes !'&#xD;
"'As Mrs. Varick,' said I, 'is entitled to receive her visitors,&#xD;
if she prefers it (as she always does) in the drawing-room, it is&#xD;
implied that that suite shall be preserved in its present character&#xD;
and not disposed of to families :-I am sorry to make so many&#xD;
conditions?'&#xD;
. Oh, no apologies is necessary !' cried Mrs. Grace. 'I&#xD;
wouldn't let these beautiful and elegant parlors to nobody; no&#xD;
money would tempt me; and then the chairs and sofeys would&#xD;
be ruinated in six months ! Ah ! bless your heart ! I know&#xD;
better than that M'&#xD;
"On the other hand Mrs. Grace made a poit that the entire&#xD;

&#xD;
remainder of the house should be at her free disposal. I barely&#xD;
hinted that Dr. Mannikin, who at present occupied the base-&#xD;
ment, might probably apply to her in order to stay ; but Mrs.&#xD;
Grace flushed up at that, and said she wouldn't have the base-&#xD;
ment occupied by a doctor on any account whatever, and she&#xD;
was not willing to sign any agreement, nor to hold me responsi-&#xD;
ble for my bargain, till Dr. Mannikin was actually out of the&#xD;
house ; 'not merely promised to go,' said she, emphatically,&#xD;
'but actually gone !'-I need not say that I was enchanted to&#xD;
find her resolute on this point.&#xD;
"' I shall say then to Dr. Mannikin that he need not apply to&#xD;
you,-as you will not let the basement to a doctor V&#xD;
"' Tell him I have disposed of the basement already, and&#xD;
that I won't have a doctor in the house. And mind, Miss Tan-&#xD;
kerville'-with great earnestness, 'I don't consider it a bargain&#xD;
till he is out of it, so that except Mrs. Varick's floor, you can&#xD;
give me possession of the entire house.'&#xD;
"'It is so understood,' said I, smiling at her vehemence.&#xD;
" While we were discussing the matter in the drawing-room,&#xD;
the doctor himself returned, and Mrs. Grace ran to the window&#xD;
to see him get out of his carriage. I could not but observe her&#xD;
paleness and agitation. She hid herself behind the curtain, and&#xD;
demanded of me nervously, if it was at all likely he would come&#xD;
upstairs. She remained at the window till he went out again,&#xD;
and seemed to breathe freely only when the brougham drove&#xD;
away. Before departing, she would take another look at the&#xD;
two basement rooms, admired the office-furniture and library,&#xD;
asked where the doctor slept, and made me show her the sofa-&#xD;
bedstead, and explain how it worked. She was excessively&#xD;
curious too, I thought, in wishing to know how my various&#xD;
rooms were at present occupied, and inquired very particularly&#xD;
into the character of Miss Smith, who she learned had occupied&#xD;
the rooms. in the extension over the dining-room. I told her&#xD;
that she was a thoroughly'estimable girl, an admirable teacher&#xD;
for a young child, with excellent government and the purest&#xD;
and most pious principles.'&#xD;
"'Why did you part with her V asked Mrs. Grace.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CROWNING VILLAINY.                145&#xD;
She insisted on leaving me, I was very sorry to lose her, I&#xD;
assure you.'&#xD;
"'Your little girl-I beg pardon, Miss Tankerville-your&#xD;
little sister, I mean-is now at school--is she ? Why wouldn't&#xD;
you board with me yourself, Miss Tankerville '&#xD;
Next year, Mrs. Grace, when Mrs. Varick shall have left&#xD;
you, perhaps I will,' said I.&#xD;
"'Ah, you have had a quarrel with this grand Mrs. Varick,&#xD;
who, they tell me, is one .of the most fasbinable ladies inall&#xD;
New York ! She and Dr. Mannikin are great friends, I hear ?'&#xD;
" We are not on the best of terms just now,' said I, smiling,&#xD;
'so I never permit myself to speak of her affairs-except in the&#xD;
way of business.'&#xD;
"'Oh, I don't want to pry into any of your secrets, Miss&#xD;
Tankerville,' replied Mrs. Grace. 'Neither Mrs. Varick, nor&#xD;
her doings, nor her particular friends, nor who she is, nor what&#xD;
she is, is anything to me. To me she is nothing but a boarder;&#xD;
and so long as she bears a fair character before the world, I ask&#xD;
no questions :-if she didn't behave herself, I would go to the&#xD;
polce-office, as sure as you are born, and enter a complaint and&#xD;
have her put into the street, just as I would any other disreput-&#xD;
able person.'&#xD;
"This clear statement relieved my mind of a great deal. I&#xD;
saw that this shy Mrs. Grace had her eyes open, and knew what&#xD;
was what, and especially what was due to herself, and probably&#xD;
what she ought to think of the great lady whom she was to pro-&#xD;
vide for ten calendar months with apartments and a table.&#xD;
"You will not wonder that I found it difficult to maintain my&#xD;
spirits in the extraordinary circumstances in wmiich I was placed,&#xD;
I might have quitted the house, placing an officer in it to protect&#xD;
property, and taken legal measures to get rid of my tenants ;&#xD;
but to take this course would have produced a public scandal,&#xD;
where now- there were only whispers and surmises, and would&#xD;
have brought my own name before the public In'a way too pain-&#xD;
ful. to be thought of. I wished the affair to be arranged without&#xD;
scar above all; and I thought-not without taking the best and&#xD;
surest advice any one can command in this world-you know&#xD;
Imean, Rosemary--I thought that every scruple of dignity&#xD;

&#xD;
as well as of virtue was satisfied by leaving my house as&#xD;
soon as I could without a violation of my engagements, and&#xD;
compelling my cousin Ezekiel Manilku to quit it. The ser-&#xD;
vants of course knew that Dr. Maiiikii aid Miss Taikeiville&#xD;
had quarrelled ; on what subject, as I had cow nunicatel with&#xD;
no one but Miss Smith, they could only conjecture. I met them&#xD;
still at table. It was an iusupporta)le penance, but I endured&#xD;
it to avoid what would have been worse. At iiight I sometimes&#xD;
feared. I was q   e alone in the third story ; the servants&#xD;
were above me ; Mrs. Varick and her family on the story below;&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin in the basement. I thought of Miss Smith's&#xD;
soothing draught and the potions of the children: often and&#xD;
often in my dreams I saw Ezekiel approaching me with a pois-&#xD;
onous dose, which I vainly attempted to resist swallowing.&#xD;
" This incessant preoccupation of my mind with one thought,&#xD;
the absence of any sympathetic companion with whom I could&#xD;
relieve it, and the depressing effect which always attends living&#xD;
with persons once intimate without being able ever to speak to&#xD;
them with genuine abandon, the fearful constraint of ruptured&#xD;
friendship and confidence betrayed, wore at last upon my health&#xD;
as well as spirits. I counted the dlays, the hours, which must&#xD;
elapse before I could be free ; and as the period approached,&#xD;
and Dr. Mannikin showed no sign of preparing to leave the&#xD;
house, and Isabel, as she left the room after one of our silent&#xD;
meals, would furtively smile, a fear seized me lest after all they&#xD;
had framed some subtle combination to defeat my purpose. I&#xD;
had never been seriously ill a single day before since the un-&#xD;
avoidable disorders of infancy ; and now I sickened, lost appe-&#xD;
tite, passed sleepless nights, got a slow fever, and wandered&#xD;
about restlessly with hollow eyes and trembling knees, like a&#xD;
criminal expecting execution. My hard cousin ate with the&#xD;
appetite of a wolf, as if crime helped his digestion; and Isabel&#xD;
Varick, her complexion grew fresher, her face fuller, her whole&#xD;
person more insolently luxuriant every day.&#xD;
"I gave them both due notice of the arrangement I had made&#xD;
with Mrs. Grace. I told Isabel what Mrs. Grace proposed&#xD;
doing for her, and what sort of person she was ; very lady-like&#xD;
in appearance, with some defects of education, sensible, shrewd&#xD;
&#xD;
and decided. Isabel Varick sneered ; supposed she would fill&#xD;
the house with vulgar rich people, with whom she could not&#xD;
associate. She observed that it was entirely a different arrange..&#xD;
ment from any which she had ever contemplated. At present&#xD;
her friends when they called saw nobody but a young lad&#xD;
whom they had been accustomed to see at her own house -her&#xD;
companion and friend; now they would meet Mrs. Washington&#xD;
Potts and goodness knows who else, all the Potts connections,&#xD;
and Mrs. Grace too, floundering on two or three sofas at once&#xD;
and the young ladies thundering at the piano and singing D'&#xD;
anti palpiti of course, from morning tonight! She might sub-&#xD;
mit to such an arrangement, because she could not help it. I&#xD;
could not expect her to like it, or to say that she regarded it&#xD;
as an honorable fulfilment of the spirit of our contract&#xD;
"'Realy, Isabel,' said I, 'you have yourself fulfilled our&#xD;
contract in its spirit so remarkably that I hardly expected that&#xD;
observation from you!'&#xD;
"'What do you mean V she asked, with an icy stare. 'Oh,&#xD;
well, if you cannot explain your remarks, you had better not&#xD;
make them.'&#xD;
"When, however, I had made known to Dr Mannikin that&#xD;
my incoming tenant would not on any terms let the basement&#xD;
either to him or any other physician, and that he must positive&#xD;
go on the second of January, if he would not oblige me by mov-&#xD;
ing before, Mrs. Varick's contemptuous apathy was stirred I&#xD;
Was very much mistaken, she told me, if I supposed she would'&#xD;
submit to any such arrangement. Ezekiel laughed scornfully&#xD;
- You can't turn me out of this house,' said he; 'I am your&#xD;
tenant, and by the law all tenures of houses in New York, with-&#xD;
out a written agreement, terminate on the first of May. O'Morra&#xD;
knows that as well as E do.'&#xD;
"On the last day of December I had a final consultation with&#xD;
 M. OMorra on the plan to be pursued. He advised me still to&#xD;
compromise with Mrs. Varick, if I could, even by a pretty large&#xD;
pecuniary sacrifice, provided she would quit the house. He&#xD;
treatedEzekiel's bravado about being my tenant with contempt,&#xD;
'I doubt,' said he, 'if the doctor will venture to make affidavit of&#xD;
that before a justice, or to -sustain it before ajjury: if he does,&#xD;

the consequences be on his own head-he will give me an op.&#xD;
portunity for which I have too long thirsted.'&#xD;
"Sad as was the time, I had some presents to buy for Laura,&#xD;
and even for Roosey, as well as for the servants; the shops&#xD;
were crowded as they ever are on New Year's Eve, and I was&#xD;
belated before I had finished my purchases. The omnibuses&#xD;
were all full, as they always are when you are in a particular&#xD;
hurry ; it was long after dark when I reach- d home laden with my&#xD;
parcels, exhausted, and feeling already the symptoms of a fever&#xD;
which nearly cost me my life. I had then to dress for dinner;&#xD;
though I could scarcely stand. At the table I fainted,'and I&#xD;
suppose that Dr. Mannikin carried me with the aid of the ser-&#xD;
vants into his back-office, for when I came to myself I was lying&#xD;
on a sofa there, and one of the maids tending me. And there&#xD;
was so much to do that evening, and I needed for it, all my&#xD;
powers of body and mind! I resolved that before going up-&#xD;
stairs, which I felt would be to take my bed for some time, I&#xD;
would see Mrs. Varick and settle with her. I sent the girl to&#xD;
tell her so. Dr. Mannikin came in and felt my pulse. He said&#xD;
that Mrs. Varick had some visitors, but that if I would compose&#xD;
myself, she would come down and see me there as soon as they&#xD;
were gone. The servants brought me tea in Dr. Mannikin's&#xD;
office, and after a while I fell into a kind of uneasy slumber--&#xD;
half doz e and half delirium-on his sofa. I was awakened by&#xD;
the doctor's telling me that Mrs. Varick was ready to see me,&#xD;
and starting up, I saw that the mantel clock pointed to ten.&#xD;
'The doctor's bed had been made up, showing that the servants&#xD;
had probably retired. Feeling suddenly alarmed, and knowing&#xD;
that in that case I was separated from them by three stories, I&#xD;
made a pretence of wishing to see the cook.--' She is gone to&#xD;
bed,' said the doctor ; 'so are all the servants ; the point is now&#xD;
to attend to your business with Mrs. Varick, after which she&#xD;
and I will help you upstairs, for you are not able to get to your&#xD;
own room alone. You are going to have a fit of sickness,&#xD;
madam.'&#xD;
"Isabel sate opposite in an elegant demi-toilette--for hap&#xD;
what would, she was always beautifully dressed. On the table&#xD;
were papers, pen and ink,  d files of receipted bills. I must&#xD;
&#xD;
have looked wo-begone enough, my hair falling about my&#xD;
death-pale face, my dress partly unhooked, and a shawl around&#xD;
me, just as I was left by the girls who took care of me when I&#xD;
fainted. The doctor was calm as a surgeon before an opera-&#xD;
tion, and politely offered me a glass of water, which I just&#xD;
tasted.&#xD;
I want to compromise this matter with you, if possible,'&#xD;
said I, rallying my energies, and addressing Isabel,&#xD;
How?'&#xD;
"I offered her at once the largest amount which Mr. O'Morra&#xD;
had designated-viz.: $4,000-if she would give up her con-&#xD;
tract.- and the lease contained in it, and engage to quit the&#xD;
premises within a week. I pointed out to her that it was&#xD;
extremely for her interest to accept the offer, for let her give&#xD;
what extravagant terms she liked ior rooms elsewhere, she&#xD;
would save at least half the amount-quite enough to support&#xD;
her another year.&#xD;
"She accepted the offer, on condition that I would draw the&#xD;
cheque immediately, when she would sign a release of the con-&#xD;
tract. I was overjoyed at this happy termination of the affair,&#xD;
with which I had less reason to be dissatisfied as within a twelve-&#xD;
month prices had gone up at least twenty-five per cent. (in&#xD;
mercantile phrase) and the appraiser had consequently estimated&#xD;
the value of the furniture of which I now became fully possessed,&#xD;
as if it had just come from the shop. Everything was done as&#xD;
fairly as possible. Dr. Mannikin produced a blank cheque,&#xD;
rehI     e  up and signed; and Isabel wrote and signed a&#xD;
release, and handed it to me together with her copy of our con-&#xD;
tract, which I put into the fire.&#xD;
" I was going, but Dr. Mannikin requested me to be seated&#xD;
He had a little business also. H' wanted a lease of the house.&#xD;
e said that le understood very well the object ofthis recent&#xD;
movement of mine ; it was inspired by his pe sonal enemy, and&#xD;
valsamed at himself. To deprive him of the house was equi-&#xD;
l     to destroying his practice,  Besides xll that, he had a&#xD;
cai upon me, which he had never intended to enforce, but&#xD;
driven as he was to extremities by a conspiracy between O'Morra&#xD;

a conspiracy to which I had made myself a party, he should&#xD;
keep no terms with me or with them. Then laying his hand&#xD;
on the files of receipted bills,-' Here is the evidence,' he added,&#xD;
'that I have paid the expenses of this house for two years past&#xD;
--butcher's bills, grocer's bills, coal-bills, all made out against&#xD;
me and all paid by me. The whole amounts to some thousands&#xD;
of dollars--'&#xD;
"'Cousin Ezekiel!' I interrupted. 'You cannot be so un-&#xD;
principled as to pretend that you have paid those bills! You&#xD;
know that I gave you the money to do it. I only did it, at your&#xD;
request, to give you consequence.'&#xD;
"'Can you prove that assertion, madam? If not, you had&#xD;
best not make it.'&#xD;
"I saw that his course was taken. He adhered .to this state-&#xD;
ment. Mrs. Varick stubbornly sustained him in it. Here was&#xD;
a debt evidently standing against me, and entered in his books.&#xD;
If I would give him a lease for five years, with privilege of&#xD;
renewal, at a low rent, he would destroy these receipts in my&#xD;
presence, but otherwise he should take such measures as would&#xD;
make me rue the day that ever I knew him. So saying he sate&#xD;
down at the table and read the lease which he had drawn up.&#xD;
The rent was fixed at $600, to commence with the first of May&#xD;
following; I was to give him a receipt in full for the first year&#xD;
in lieu of the unpaid balance of the stipend that I owed him.&#xD;
Do you believe me when I tell you that those infamous people&#xD;
would not allow me to leave them till I had signed this paper ?&#xD;
It was two in the morning, before, under the influence of threats&#xD;
so terrible that to hear them only deprived me almost of my&#xD;
senses, and utterly worn out by their persevering cruelty, to&#xD;
escape from their hands and their persecution, I consented to&#xD;
everything they proposed. Isabel Varick's eyes flashed with&#xD;
so fiendish a joy that I half suspected eveh then that I had&#xD;
done more, and was more in their power than I suspected.&#xD;
Not a word was said about the furniture, without which it&#xD;
would be impossible for them to get along: but I was too glad&#xD;
to be let alone, and to crawl upstairs, to mind anything. In fact)&#xD;
I fully believed that I should die, and little cared I for the rest.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
ISS TANKERVILLE'S STORY FINISHED---ALARMING INCIDENT.&#xD;
"THE six weeks that followed were nearly a blank to me&#xD;
When the time came for Mr. O'Morra to eject Dr. Mannikin,&#xD;
that gentleman alleged that the difficulty between himself and&#xD;
his cousin was arranged, and produced his lease. O'Morra in-&#xD;
sisted on seeing me. He found me .in bed, delirious. He in-&#xD;
sbted on a consultation. The consulting physician agreed with&#xD;
Dr. Manikin that I had a low fever of malignant type, comi-&#xD;
mended the doctor's prescriptions, and supported his opinion that&#xD;
I could not be removed without extreme danger. Owing to the&#xD;
malignity of the case, Mrs. Varick had fled with her children&#xD;
Ezekiel was doubtless sincerely anxious to save my life, know-&#xD;
ing that in my hands lie was much safer from a legal prosecu-&#xD;
tion than he would be in those of Mr. O'Morra, who was my&#xD;
executor and guardian of my sister. One servant was allowed&#xD;
to attend me; my medicines he administered himself. At last&#xD;
I was convalescent-&#xD;
" Until I was pronounced out of danger, O'Morra sent Or&#xD;
called every day to make inquiries. In the meantime Ezekiel had&#xD;
taken measures to put me out of the house as soon as I was fit&#xD;
toene moved. While I was unconscious, every formality had&#xD;
been complied with ; and as I did not appear to defend myself&#xD;
i the obscure court t where he ertered his complaint of forcible&#xD;
detaofer, a writ was issued to eject me. The object of this move&#xD;
was of course to put himself in possession not only of the house,&#xD;
but pofe future, so that I could not recover either unless by&#xD;
a Process of law. The first day that he judged me able to go&#xD;
fod sis, D. Mannikin waited on me in my room and in.&#xD;
formed me that a sheriff's deputy was below to turn me out of&#xD;
, in that I must leave immediately. In vain I re-&#xD;

ALARMING INCIDENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
inonstrated with him on the brutality of thus turning me out,&#xD;
without giving me time to look for other quarters, or for a place&#xD;
to store my furniture.&#xD;
" ' Furniture !' said he, scornfully. 'What you have is easily&#xD;
stored. The Varick furniture, I suppose you know, belongs to&#xD;
me. Mrs. Varick never had any right to sell it. There is a&#xD;
bill of sale from her husband to me. Had you treated me&#xD;
honorably,' I never should have mentioned it, but after your&#xD;
joining in the defeated conspiracy to ruin me and Mrs. Varick,&#xD;
I stand upon my legal rights. So pack at once! These old&#xD;
traps that belonged to your father you can of course move out:&#xD;
there are men here waiting to put them into the street,.'-And&#xD;
without another word he threw open the door and called in the&#xD;
porters.&#xD;
"1Resistance was vain. The men were accustomed to move&#xD;
out refractory tenants. I had an old bureau, older sofa, some&#xD;
venerable chairs, a child's crib which stood in Laura's room,&#xD;
and other relics of my mother's housekeeping. These were&#xD;
readily taken out one after another; IDr. Mannikin stood by&#xD;
giving directions in an imperious tone. I requested him to&#xD;
withdraw that I might pack my clothes.&#xD;
I'll pack them for you,' said he,; 'we can't stand on deli-&#xD;
cate ceremonies, Miss, to-day.'--And opening a large trunk, he&#xD;
went himself, in spite of my resistance, to the various presses,&#xD;
drawers, &amp;amp;c.; took out my dresses and flung them in pell-mell,&#xD;
and when the trunk was full, even going the length of empty-&#xD;
ing with his own hands drawers that contained soiled under-&#xD;
clothing, all in a heap, into a large uncovered basket, sending it&#xD;
down stairs, and standing it on the side-walk-an outrage incre-&#xD;
dible, accomplished by physical violence, and which no woman&#xD;
can ever forgive. The very officer who was present with a jus-&#xD;
tice's warrant for this unmanly insult,.and who had been led to&#xD;
believe that I was a troublesome lodger who failed to pay my&#xD;
rent, was shocked, and when he saw me come down stairs,&#xD;
pale with recent illness, in tears, and the servants all weeping&#xD;
and boldly crying shame-' To turn Miss Tankerville out of her&#xD;
own house !' he said to the doctor-' I believe that you are a&#xD;
great villain, sir !'-' why don't you turn him out, then ' cried&#xD;
&#xD;
I. 'For this house and everything in it, except the office furni-&#xD;
ture, are mine, I assure you .'-' Madam,' said the officer, 'I&#xD;
don't doubt your word, but my orders is to turn you out. You&#xD;
must sue him, ma'am, and justice will be done you !'--'For&#xD;
every wrong there is a remedy,' said an inferior official. 'If&#xD;
the d octor have wronged you, Miss, you can sue him for damages&#xD;
afterwards.'&#xD;
"The truth of my being the injured party struck them all&#xD;
when I had the pictures in the drawing-room taken down.&#xD;
Then I bethought me of my silver. I moved direct to the&#xD;
dining-room. It was the hour of luncheon, and the table was&#xD;
set. To my surprise Mrs. Varick was there; for the servants&#xD;
had told me of her departure, and I had not heard of her return.&#xD;
"' Oh!' she exclaimed. 'You are going-are you? Won't&#xD;
you take pot-luck with us l'-Rising as if we were the best&#xD;
friends in the world. It was her pet expression.&#xD;
"'No, Mrs. Varick,' said I, ' I am not going to take pot-luck;&#xD;
I'm going to take my silver.'&#xD;
"'Pardon me,' said Dr. Mannikin, who followed me close 'I&#xD;
can't allow the silver to le've the house. There's a bill due me&#xD;
for your board these two months past, and for medical attend-&#xD;
ance. I shall retain the silver as security for the debt.'&#xD;
"This was the last drop that made the cup overflow. Hith-.&#xD;
erto, indignant as I was, I had observed all the refined rules of&#xD;
lady-like conduct even in resenting the infamous treatment I&#xD;
had received. I could contain myself no longer. I marched&#xD;
resolutely to the side-board, where the silver-basket stodd in full&#xD;
view, and took it. Dr. Mannikin approached to take it from me&#xD;
by force. I seized a large carving-knife that lay on the table to&#xD;
cut a round of cold spiced beef. It was sharp-pointed and keen&#xD;
as a razor.&#xD;
You cowardly scoffndrel,' said I, panting with rage, 'touch&#xD;
me if you dare, and I will strike this knife into your heart&#xD;
You keep my silver indeed!'&#xD;
t"Brandishing the carver, before which he retreated, I made&#xD;
the circuit of the table, picking up the spoons, forks, and every&#xD;
other article that was of silver, and threw them into my basket&#xD;
Mrs. Varick got hastily out of my way--I believe she thought I&#xD;

was mad. I ended by taking a large silver tureen from the&#xD;
sideboard, filling it with the goblets, and such articles as were&#xD;
not kept in the basket, and calling one of the girls, who came&#xD;
with a good-will,-lashing him all the while (as women do) with&#xD;
my tongue to keep up my own courage and damp his,-we car-&#xD;
ried all out together, and I never quitted the knife till I got into&#xD;
the street. Then as I turned and threw it down in the ball, I saw&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin and Mrs Varick following me with affected&#xD;
laughter. I stepped back like a lioness at bay : they retreated&#xD;
a step.&#xD;
" "'Laugh!' said I, bitterly. 'Yes, you may laugh. You have&#xD;
robbed me between you of half I possessed in the world ! But&#xD;
I have one treasure left which you have forfeited, sir-honor!&#xD;
And one more precious still which you have not, madam-.&#xD;
chastity!',&#xD;
"Ezekiel rushed towards me, but the officer pushed him back,&#xD;
and leading me out, shut the door upon him.&#xD;
" A crowd of boys had collected to see a lady put upon the&#xD;
sidewalk like a beggar who can't pay her rent. The neighbors&#xD;
looked from the windows-not one of them personally known to&#xD;
me-for the neighborhood had changed and they were new-&#xD;
comers. I believe they thought I was some light character&#xD;
turned out for cause. Exhausted by passion, and feeling my&#xD;
physical weakness once more, I sank into one of the chairs, put&#xD;
down my head and sobbed aloud. I might have been robbed&#xD;
of everything and I should not have noticed it.&#xD;
"It is not necessary to linger over the rest. Of course I got&#xD;
into safe and respectable quarters at last, and sent for Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra. I shan't stop either to explain why (in spite of his&#xD;
boiling indignation at my weakness) I declined to prosecute&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin. That gentleman had rightly calculated that&#xD;
neither desire of vengeance nor the wish to recover my property&#xD;
would weigh against my family pride and dread of an eclat.&#xD;
He was sure of this from the first moment that I showed it was&#xD;
my intention to get rid of them quietly, and he acted on that&#xD;
knowledge."&#xD;
" Ah! that was your grand mistake, Miss Helen," said Rose-&#xD;
mary. "At the first instant of that terrible discovery, I would&#xD;
&#xD;
ALARMING INCIDENT.        155&#xD;
&#xD;
have quitted the house, with my sister, and gone-anywhere.&#xD;
Then I would have entrusted the whole affair to my man of&#xD;
business, and the faces of those wicked people never have looked&#xD;
at again !"&#xD;
"It is easy to criticize after it is all over, and you not a party&#xD;
involved. No doubt I was cowardly, weak, and demoralized by&#xD;
the humiliating position in which I found myself. No one could&#xD;
associate so long and so intimately with such people and imbibe&#xD;
no harm.  True maidenly courage would have acted as you&#xD;
suggest, and the result would have been very different."&#xD;
"You were educated, Miss Helen, at Madam Commifaut's,&#xD;
which I have always heard was a very fashionable school, and&#xD;
you know a great many things that I do not. I was brought&#xD;
up at home, or in.a convent, and yet I don't think I should have&#xD;
been taken in by Isabel Varick in the very beginning, as you&#xD;
were. Your story convinces me that innocent people have in-&#xD;
stinctive distrusts which serve to protect them. Even when a&#xD;
child I had such premonitions about Isabel Varick, although I&#xD;
could not have the faintest idea of her incredible badness. Now&#xD;
I seem to be saying that you were'not innocent, but you know&#xD;
that is not what I mean, my dear Miss Tankerville."&#xD;
' Innocence is a relative term. I was not altogether so inno-&#xD;
cent as you are," said Miss Tankerville, with a look of great&#xD;
tenderness.&#xD;
"I like you best," said Rosemary, smiling, "when that horn-&#xD;
ble Dr. Mannikin turns you into the street. A wise'man, whom&#xD;
I dearly love, said to me once' A woman's tongue is given her&#xD;
for a defence !'-And he bade me never fear to use it when I&#xD;
had occasion. I could kiss the feet of a penitent of the Good&#xD;
Shepherd; but such a shameless creature as that,-I should&#xD;
hold it less unladylike to spit in her face than to speak to her&#xD;
in terms of seeming friendship. But pray go on with your&#xD;
story, and bring it down to the present time."&#xD;
"That summer was occupied in re-establishing my health. In&#xD;
the autumn-the Fall, as we Americans poetically term it-I&#xD;
hired another house (for boarding was utterly distasteful to me),&#xD;
and to eke out my income in part, and partly for the comfort of&#xD;
society, gave apartments to some real friends, Mr. O'Morra&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6853-00000080"/>&#xD;
ALARMING INCIDENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
being the chief. A few years later to avoid all kinds of&#xD;
intercourse, even indirect, with Dr. Mannikin, I sold my house,&#xD;
and bought this one, where I have regularly embarked in the&#xD;
business, as you perceive. It was time, because Laura was&#xD;
growing up like a weed, and I saw that in a few years ray&#xD;
means would be cut off by her marriage. It has turned out&#xD;
very well. People like to board with a lady who has no rent to&#xD;
pay, who cannot be turned out of her house because the land-&#xD;
lord wants to ;ell or build, and lastly who is a lady. Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra has fitted up his own apartments as if he were to be an&#xD;
eternal fixture here. Meanwhile, although I lay up nothing&#xD;
directly, I am growing rich, he tells me, by the rise in value of&#xD;
my property. Nobody in Brooklyn is more respected, I believe,&#xD;
than Miss Tankerville."&#xD;
"And your sister ?"&#xD;
"Oh! about a year and a half ago, Commander Varick came&#xD;
here seeking board. Odious as the name was to me, I admitted&#xD;
him for old acquaintance' sake: for I had not seen him since&#xD;
he danced with me in his middy's uniform on the night of my&#xD;
first party. An old maid has always a weakness for the beaux&#xD;
of her youth. I am glad that there is a Varick of whom I can&#xD;
speak well. The commander (now Captain Varick) is as brave&#xD;
and noble a fellow as ever trod quarter-deck, telescope in hand.&#xD;
He wanted a room in my house because he could see his ship&#xD;
from-the windows. When he had been with me a month, and&#xD;
everybody in the house was in love with the candor and noole-&#xD;
ness of the man, Laura came home for her vacation. What will&#xD;
you have'?  Dashon (as we love to call him) was a sailor. He&#xD;
invited us to visit his ship; and Laura, whom I regarded as a&#xD;
child, and scolded her for her forwardness in asking Captain&#xD;
Varick so many questions, and giving him so much trouble, and&#xD;
screaming like a little fool because his gig rocked on the fresh&#xD;
waves of the bay, entangled his heart with that simple school-&#xD;
girl net; and before she has been at home a week, the com-&#xD;
mander comes to ask my permission. I refuse, and tell him the&#xD;
outlines of my unfortunate connection with the family. le&#xD;
swears to shoot Dr. Mannikin. I say if he does he shall never&#xD;
have Laura. In fine, 1 consult Mr. O'Morra, and give my con-&#xD;
&#xD;
sent provided his family are willing. He applies to his family.&#xD;
The Varicks make an unheard-of row; for the captain's expect..&#xD;
ations are considerable; he must have his share of old Peter&#xD;
Varick's property when his father dies, who has ohly a life&#xD;
estate, and they want him to marry (as I told you before) his&#xD;
cousin, Miss Dashon, the great heiress. The captain was in a&#xD;
great rage, for the theory of the Varicks has always been that&#xD;
this girl, whom old Mr. Dashon had acknowledged after his&#xD;
son's death, was illegitimate. however, to please them  he&#xD;
drove over to the Sacred heart, where she was at school, to see&#xD;
her, ie described the interview to us on his return. Miss&#xD;
Dashon was not at all to his taste; dark, plain, no manner&#xD;
dressed like an overgrown school-girl, none of Laura's womanly&#xD;
graces, or fine eye for costume, and not a word to say, only to&#xD;
offer both cheeks to her aunt Varick aad the tips of her fingers&#xD;
to her sailor cousin. No hope of marrying her under two years,&#xD;
which would be three for him; and no certainty of it then ex-&#xD;
cept that his lady mother assured that Miss Dashon had no&#xD;
mind of her own, and would conform exactly to the will of her&#xD;
grandparents, who both desired the match. At all events the&#xD;
gil never looked at him, never smiled till they rose to depart&#xD;
and a mountain of prize money wouldn't tempt him to take&#xD;
such an iceberg for his consort. In short the man was past&#xD;
thirty, and had reason on his side as weli as sentiment, and&#xD;
Laura being nearly seventeen, and he to sail in a few months&#xD;
on a three 'ears' cruise, it was either marry at once, or not at&#xD;
all. So I dispensed with the permission of the illustrious house&#xD;
of Vatick, and we had a wedding in this house to which half&#xD;
Brooklyn was invited. What is more to the point, Dashon had&#xD;
never been baptized ; this was an essential point, you know;&#xD;
and it was attended, to by him so piously ; and they were mar-&#xD;
ried in Sydney Place at eight o'clock in the morning, without&#xD;
dipensation and with all the ceremonies; and I felt more than&#xD;
ever glad that suffer what I might I had not inflicted on the&#xD;
name of Varick an open and indelible disgrace."&#xD;
Every one of the race, and all related to them, owe you a&#xD;
debt of everlasting gratitude for that," said Rosemary, with&#xD;
feeling g frtht"si.osmrwt&#xD;

"And what Varick are you? for your blushes and emotion at&#xD;
parts of my story prove that you do belong to them. Yet I&#xD;
cannot fix you."&#xD;
The young lady hesitated, looked down, blushed.&#xD;
'' I am the daughter of Richard Varick Dashon-'handsome&#xD;
Dick Dashon,' Miss Tankerville-the young lady of whom your&#xD;
gallant brother-in-law gave you so flattering a description !"&#xD;
" You Miss Dashon ! old Roosevelt Dashon's granddaughter&#xD;
and heiress !" exclaimed Miss Tankerville, quite stupefied.&#xD;
"They call me Dashon-it was the name of my father-I ne-&#xD;
ver claim it-nor ever will till something happens which perhaps&#xD;
never will happen."&#xD;
"I understand-Tsabel Varick used to maintain that you&#xD;
were not born in wedlock."&#xD;
"I do not blame her, for saying so--for I have supplanted&#xD;
them all," said Rosemary, gently.&#xD;
"But I never knew that Miss Dashon was dead-still less&#xD;
that she died on her wedding-night-as you did, or were thought&#xD;
to do!"&#xD;
"Who says I died on my wedding-night 7" demanded Miss&#xD;
Dashon, with a vivid blush.&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin, I believe. lie did not say you wire married,&#xD;
but that you died at the altar : which your dress when brought&#xD;
here confirmed."&#xD;
" Dr. Mannikin is too deep for me. I cannot conceive his&#xD;
motive for such a very singular untruth. What else did he&#xD;
say ?"&#xD;
"That you were buried as you died, in your wedding clothes,&#xD;
at your own express desire before you breathed your last, or&#xD;
something to that effect."&#xD;
"Worse and worse ! Do you think I am the sort of person&#xD;
to be guilty of such a piece of weak sentimentality in my&#xD;
last moments?  Depend upon it if I 'thought myself dying&#xD;
I should be a great deal more apt to be thinking what would&#xD;
become of my poor soul in the other world than of the way my&#xD;
body shoid be dressed for the funeral."&#xD;
"I cannot allow that I was very stupid not to think .of this&#xD;
before," said Miss Tankerville; "for if you are Miss Dashon-&#xD;
&#xD;
Roose'velt Dashon's granddaughter-is it not excessively strange&#xD;
that I never heard either of your intended marriage or supposed&#xD;
death? True, we have no intercourse with the Varicks, yet&#xD;
surely some of our friends would have observed so noticeable an&#xD;
event; and Laura, who reads all the papers, hoping to get news&#xD;
of the squadron, and never misses the deaths and marriages,&#xD;
would be sure to light upon it."&#xD;
"That you never heard of my intended marriage," said Miss&#xD;
Dashon, with a singular expression, "is not so surprising. I&#xD;
own that I am a little puzzled myself that you never heard of&#xD;
my death. Certainly, it was no secret. I. heard it said that&#xD;
fifty carriages followed me to Gieenwood. IT MUST HAVE BEEN&#xD;
N THE PAPERS !"&#xD;
At this moment a sepulchral voice was distinctly heard, as if&#xD;
close to them saying&#xD;
"IT WAS NOT IN THE PAPERS !"&#xD;
Both the women started up in affright. Rosemary shrieked.&#xD;
Miss Tankerville ran to the closet. A man darted from the&#xD;
long folds of the curtain that fell from the canopy of the bed,&#xD;
sprang to the window, threw it open, and disappeared.&#xD;
"Goodness !" said Miss Tankerville.&#xD;
"IHoly Virgin, protect me !" said Rosemary.&#xD;
The latter stood in the middle of 'the room as if transfixed,&#xD;
her eyes dilated with terror. Miss Tankerville, with her wonted&#xD;
physical- courage, ran to the open window, and stepped out&#xD;
on the balcony.  A knotted rope, fastened by aid of a loop&#xD;
round one of the rails, plainly indicated how the intruder had&#xD;
both entered and escaped. The time as evidently had been&#xD;
while they were engaged in searching the parlors below, after&#xD;
their first fruitless alarm. Miss Tankerville drew in the rope,&#xD;
pulling it through the loop, and dragged it into the room.&#xD;
"It is I that am aimed at still !" said the terrified Rosemary.&#xD;
"IHow lucky I sate up with you to-night telling stories ! My&#xD;
lengthy narrative has baffled some nefarious project, doubtless.&#xD;
Rosemary, you must always close your shutters after dark, and&#xD;
bar them on the inside! And I will not quit you to-slight."&#xD;
Searching the carpet they found behind the bed a bottle ,f&#xD;
chloroform.&#xD;

"I believe after all," said Miss Tankerville, " that they are&#xD;
vulgar thieves, and that your pearls, not you, were the object&#xD;
sought. He would disdain to have recourse to so vulgar an&#xD;
expedient as chloroform!"&#xD;

nerves of Rosemary became tranquillized, and long before Miss&#xD;
Tankerville closed her eyes, the younger lady slept the deep                                 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.&#xD;
and heaven-bestowed sleep of youth and innocence.&#xD;
Tnus far have we followed the rule laid down by the famous&#xD;
author of the Art of Poetry. We plunged at once, in our First&#xD;
Book, 'in medlias res-into the very crisis and fire-heat of the&#xD;
story : for surely the death, burial and resurrection of the&#xD;
Heroine are nothing less. Then by way of episode we have had&#xD;
a history which sets before us the antecedents of some of the&#xD;
principal villains of the fiction, whom the discerning Rea  al-.&#xD;
ready detects -as deeply implicated in the sinister event  ch&#xD;
has so nearly cost the heroine her life, and which for the pres-&#xD;
ent has separated her from her family and her betrothed, and&#xD;
thrown her among strangers. In listening to this history of an-&#xD;
other, Rosemary has perceived a strong though mysterious light&#xD;
to flash upon her own. ' The story of Miss Tankerville was very&#xD;
necessary in another point of view, viz.: in order to make an&#xD;
artful transition between the romanticist torch-light glare of&#xD;
Rosemary's first entrance upon the stage, and the pure yet not&#xD;
untroub~led daylight of her childhood's history. For it is now&#xD;
high time that we resume her story from its beginnings, and&#xD;
satisfy the curiosity of the reader by showing who she was, and&#xD;
what causes led to the singular but powerr true" events thus far&#xD;
recorded.&#xD;
One design that we have in these Introductory Chapters is to&#xD;
eluidlate the moral of the narrative, which otherwise some per-&#xD;
sons would be dull enough to miss. The unsophisticated reader,&#xD;
- indeed, will at once perceive it without any help of ours; since&#xD;
it lies quite on the surface; it is the sophisticated--those who&#xD;
have already a theory about books, and hence see nothing na-&#xD;
turally and simply, whose misapprehensions we have to guard&#xD;
against,&#xD;

'162               ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now in the story of Miss Tankerville we see the impossibility&#xD;
of navigating the treacherous ocean of life, even with ever so&#xD;
good a will to arrive safely at port, without either rudder or&#xD;
compass. The compass is a knowledge of our vocation; the&#xD;
rudder implies authority. Here was a young woman left to her&#xD;
own guidance, without father, husband or guardian, and she&#xD;
got on a lee shore and. drifted among the rocks. It needs no&#xD;
long line, no heavy plummet, nor any of the appliances of deep-&#xD;
sea fishing, to fetch up this old time-honored moral, which is&#xD;
good enough for us.&#xD;
Book Second will also comprise the personal history of a-&#xD;
young woman of the higher ranks. The original type of her&#xD;
character is richer in the elements which tend to splendid&#xD;
evils, and her surroundings will be more abundant in tempta-&#xD;
tion on the side where her sex is most liable to it. We shall&#xD;
n    restall the narrative. It will contain more than one illustra-&#xD;
tion of our principle. If in so simple and, as it were, every day&#xD;
maxim the reader does not find a sufficient moral, he will search&#xD;
in vain for one in these pages: for we have not undertaken to&#xD;
talk like a prayer-book, in order to prove that we may be read&#xD;
with profit. This is not a prayer-book, but a story, written&#xD;
expressly to win the attention of those who will r: ad nothing&#xD;
but stories, and sensational ones at that ; and if we succeed in&#xD;
adding to the species that literary merit in which most speci-&#xD;
mens that we have seen are notably deficient, we shall be con-&#xD;
tent. It will go hard if we do not produce something at least&#xD;
as well worth reading as the masterpieces of Mr. Sylvanus&#xD;
Cobb (Jr.), or the still sublimer productions of the author (ess)&#xD;
of the "Hidden Hand !"  After provolking such a comparison,&#xD;
nobody certainly will accuse us of a want of proper humility.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE GRANDPARENTS.&#xD;
M. RoMARIN was a Frenchman by birth, of the class of art-&#xD;
ists. It was a family that had seen better days. The grandsire&#xD;
of M. Romarin was a judge in the reign of Louis XVI., and&#xD;
ennobled by letters patent of that monarch, so that his descend-&#xD;
ant might, if he had liked, have prefixed to his patronymic the&#xD;
symbolic de, so much valued by the French aristocracy of the&#xD;
gown. This ancestor lost all in the Revolution, his gray head&#xD;
inclusive; and his son was swept into the army by the conscrip-&#xD;
tion, where his gallantry might have won him another "de"&#xD;
from Napoleon I., but he was killed in the rank of captain, and&#xD;
wearing the cross of the Legion of Honor, in the campaign of&#xD;
Austerlitz. The young Romarin (son of the last-mentioned)&#xD;
was educated at the imperial expense in a military school, and&#xD;
was old enough to participate in the disastrous campaigns of&#xD;
1813-14. After the events of 1815, having no hopes of promo-&#xD;
tion, and mortally disaffected to the Bourbons, he came to&#xD;
America, where he taught fencing, music, and his native lan-&#xD;
guage. For the last metier he'had a decided genius. His&#xD;
method of oral instruction in French, original with him, but&#xD;
adopted by more fortunate teachers since, and rendered famous&#xD;
bythegrammars aud manuals of Ollendorf, needs only to be&#xD;
. He would have become rich by his pupils, had he&#xD;
not been cursed with a taste for so many arts besides. Romarin&#xD;
drew very well, and might have succeeded as a painter; but his&#xD;
passion, or perhaps I should say, his hobby, was music. He&#xD;
spent a third of his waking life in the vain attempt to make&#xD;
himself a great pianist. He composed an opera, but he could&#xD;
never get it per r mad. The artists said it was really superb,&#xD;
but quite impractica)le. This misdirected ambition kept Ro-&#xD;

&#xD;
marin, in spite of so much talent and industry, always poor.&#xD;
The "know thyself" is the first requisite of successful genius.&#xD;
Romarin had a fine person, in a poetical style-dark eyes,&#xD;
curling black hair, a well-formed brow, classic features. His&#xD;
female pupils admired him hugely. He became passionately&#xD;
amoureux of one, the belle of the season, a very beautiful girl&#xD;
according to the standard of that time, and of the highest&#xD;
social position in the city; who flirted with the dark-eyed, for-&#xD;
eign music teacher (Romarin had not commenced his French&#xD;
classes at that date, nor invented his great system), listened to&#xD;
his vows, half promised to run away with him, and ended by&#xD;
marrying a rich merchant. This heartless behavior (no for-&#xD;
eigner at first understands what is meant by flirtation) nearly&#xD;
broke Romarin's heart, but he was a brave man, and as it&#xD;
happened that there was another young lady very much eprise&#xD;
d lui at the same time, desolated that he was, he magnani-&#xD;
mously took pity on her and married her off hand. There&#xD;
never was a sweeter creature on earth than the young West-In-&#xD;
dian whom Romarin wedded. Her name was Floreal, child of&#xD;
a planter in Guadaloupe whose estate had been swallowed up&#xD;
by an earthquake. She was not beautiful, nor striking in any&#xD;
way; but she was good; like a very child in innocence and&#xD;
sweet broken English ; and Romarin made an incomparably&#xD;
lucky bargain when he married her instead of the brilliant and&#xD;
worldly Isabel Varick. Unfortunately our climate did not suit&#xD;
her, and after the birth of her second child, a sickly infant and&#xD;
short-lived, she went into a decline and died, leaving Romarin&#xD;
with a little girl to bring up. It was this daughter of Romarin's,&#xD;
who at the age of twenty became the mother of Rosemary.&#xD;
Rosemary was born in the attic of a tenant-house in Varick&#xD;
street.-" But stop !" you cry. "  Is that all you are going to&#xD;
tell us about it ' What preceded her birth-that is what we&#xD;
want to know, and which, you have promised to narrate !" My&#xD;
dear madam, you know as well as I do (if you have read Miss&#xD;
Tankerville's story) that Rosemary's father was "handsome&#xD;
Dick Dashon," only son of a rich merchant, whose wife, and&#xD;
consequently the mother of Dick, was a Varick before her mar-&#xD;
riage: there's the whole genealogy ! This young man--Richard&#xD;
&#xD;
Varick Dashon-was a well-bred, well-educated young fellow,&#xD;
who had graduated with credit at Columbia College, and was&#xD;
reading law in the office of C. O'Morra, Esq. He was also a pupil&#xD;
of Romarin's; for his mother had said to him --" My son, your&#xD;
French accent is detestable, and I know of but one teacher in&#xD;
the city who could correct it: that's Captain Romarin, ex-offi-&#xD;
cer of Napoleon's army." Dick Dashon had a great way of&#xD;
taking his mother's advice; her influence over him was un-&#xD;
bounded, and was the source both of his faults and of his vir-&#xD;
tues: for Dick was not only handsome, but for , young New-&#xD;
Yorker virtuous,-if virtue admits of a secundum quid. The&#xD;
virtue of a young New-Yorker that does not admit of a second&#xD;
quid, and a third quid, and lots of cigars into .the bargain,&#xD;
must be a tip-top virtue, you opine. However, Varick Dashon&#xD;
was a good son, a trifle extravagant (as young men are apt&#xD;
who have unlimited pocket-money), a terrible fireman, captain of&#xD;
a company, which kc l)t him out at all hours and gave him a&#xD;
slight but dangerous proclivity for brandy and cigars--it was a&#xD;
perfect insanity these fire-companies in Dick Dashon's time: on&#xD;
the other hand his mother rather encouraged it-" for young&#xD;
men with such an excess of moral an physical energy as Dick&#xD;
must have excitement," she said. II  was a magnificent fellow&#xD;
physically, no doubt, strong as a young lion, with the head of an&#xD;
Apollo set on his broad shoulders,and equally superb to see in&#xD;
the yellow-gaunueted and switch-caned attire of a Broadway&#xD;
promenade, or in red-shirt and fireman's cap, splashed hip-high&#xD;
with mud and drenched with the 'water of his own ppand&#xD;
bawling through his trumpet at a ire.  under all  pipe,and&#xD;
he                           fie thde -llcircumstandes&#xD;
was the same irresistible Dick Dashon. His name-pro-&#xD;
nounced Dash-on!.--became the cry of his men, and with the&#xD;
wxitbys and youths who crowded to every fire to partake the&#xD;
excitement, it was the synonym of daring energy and invincible&#xD;
pluck.&#xD;
This splendid young man had features and bore a name-which&#xD;
after the lapse of twenty years still powerfully affected Romarin,&#xD;
who declined giving him lessons unless Varick would come to his&#xD;
cos; Mfor nothing could have induced the ex-oficer to&#xD;
s threshold as the tutor of her son. Varick&#xD;

&#xD;
readily consented to this arrangement, which showed neverthe.&#xD;
less a great Want of ordinary prudence on the part of Romarin.&#xD;
Nay, so little forethought did he show (being then absorbed in&#xD;
his grand opera) that one day when he missed Varick's lesson&#xD;
to attend a rehearsal, he requested Th6rese to supply his place&#xD;
by asking the conversational questions in that famous manual&#xD;
invented and composed by himself. The pupil (at nineteen&#xD;
who would have felt otherwise'?) was not at all chagrined at the&#xD;
substitution ; the lesson proved three hours long instead of one,&#xD;
and the conversation was not confined to the questions in&#xD;
Romarin's book.-&#xD;
When papa returned he found Dashon still receiving his&#xD;
lesson. Fancy the explanations, fancy the pupil dismissed, and&#xD;
the daughter forbidden to see him more. Imagine that the&#xD;
self-willed Varick applies to his own astonished parents.&#xD;
Conceive, if you can, their indignation and dismay, and how&#xD;
completely even Mrs. Roosevelt Dashon has forgotten that she&#xD;
learned her own famous French accent, long time ago, from the&#xD;
lips of love and Romarin,&#xD;
Romarin's domestic affairs were regulated and administered&#xD;
by a Swiss bonne named Louise. These bonnes and feminine&#xD;
domestics were in all time so many go-betweens. Is it not no-&#xD;
torious'? One believes that Louise was much the same. If not&#xD;
a venal ally of Dashon, she was no less effectually bribed by her&#xD;
devotion to her young mistress, and a natural desire to promote&#xD;
her advancement in life. In fact, but for the native tendencies&#xD;
of bonnes and maids to accomplish the views of lovers rather&#xD;
than of parents, half the romances could never take place.&#xD;
There is no doubt that Dashon and Therese met often in secret.&#xD;
By and by Mademoiselle fled with her lover, and, some months&#xD;
after, Rosemary was born.&#xD;
" Were they not married, then '?" asks the reader, very much&#xD;
shocked. Dear reader ! I should be as much shocked as you if&#xD;
I thought they were not. Indeed I never should have written&#xD;
this history at all if I had not been well convinced of the con-&#xD;
trary. It is a sufficient fault already to have made a clandes-&#xD;
tine marriage. Not that Varick Dashon regarded it as a fault.&#xD;
,In the eyes of young New York at that period it was rather&#xD;
&#xD;
rigorously a merit. That love, if sincere and honorable, justi-&#xD;
fied any extravagance, was perfectly established in the ethics of&#xD;
nearly all his associates under twenty. Besides, I always&#xD;
thought that Varick's family had only themselves to blame.&#xD;
He was an affectionate son, but obedience as obedience he had&#xD;
never known. Mrs. Dashon did not obey her husband : she&#xD;
could not complain if her son (in a critical point) obeyed neither.&#xD;
Their opposition also was unreasonable and violent, and it pro-&#xD;
ceeded chiefly from his mother ; for his father, though his wife&#xD;
made him dislike the match, was disposed to temporize ; but&#xD;
Mrs. Roosevelt Dashon was a very great lady, with a very&#xD;
strong will, and she ruled the house; and she had set her foot&#xD;
down (to use a vulgar expression) that Romarin's daughter&#xD;
should never be its mistress. No doubt Mademoiselle Romarin&#xD;
was much more to blame. One shows less mercy always to the&#xD;
lady in these runaway affairs. Women especially are slow to&#xD;
pardon her, and yet I should like to see what some of these fair&#xD;
censors would do if ilzey had a lover like Varick Dashon. It&#xD;
was a youth accu tomed to have his own way entirely, and who&#xD;
knew not the name of fear. Once--it was while he was courting&#xD;
Therese-he scaled a fourth story window to rescue a lame&#xD;
child, only a minute before the roof fell in: the unsupported&#xD;
wall on which the spliced ladder rested trembled as he de-&#xD;
scended with his helpless burden. A silver trumpet was pre-&#xD;
sented to Capt. Dashon for this gallant action. It was not so&#xD;
easy as you perhaps think for a girl of nineteen-a poor teach-&#xD;
er's daughter-to deny the honorable suit of such a brave fellow&#xD;
as that-so flattering to her ambition and to every other natural&#xD;
sentiment. Then I am afraid she had a very bad adviser in&#xD;
Louise. When the simple-hearted bonnie saw that her young&#xD;
mistress was impetuously pursued by a young man of such&#xD;
force of character and so high a social rank as Varick Dashon,&#xD;
she concluded at once that it must end either in marriage or&#xD;
some dreadful catastrophe, a ruined reputation or a broken&#xD;
heart, or both: for " his family will never consent," she said,&#xD;
"and my master is too proud to give his consent without theirs ;"&#xD;
so she counselled her adored pet and foster-child to wed without&#xD;
it. I know that Th6rese sharply reproved her bonne for this&#xD;

&#xD;
indiscreet advice, which however by no means proves that she&#xD;
did not subsequently follow it. It rested entirely with herself&#xD;
to do so, for the only thing necessary to make a marriage by&#xD;
our laws, was a mutual contract, even without witnesses, and it&#xD;
appears that there was more than this, whereof the following is&#xD;
- the evidence.&#xD;
The old French bishop of New York was a friend of the&#xD;
Romarins, and the confessor of Mlle. Romarin. It is a fact and&#xD;
was thought a little scandalous by some, that she never inter-&#xD;
mitted her monthly communion during the whole year that re-&#xD;
ceded the birth of her child. The bishop himself gave her&#xD;
communion just before this event, while she was living openly&#xD;
with Varick. It was the inference, drawn by everybody who&#xD;
witnessed it, that the bishop himself had married them; and the&#xD;
reasoning on which this inference proceeded was found after-&#xD;
wards to have great legal force.&#xD;
A motive for concealment was not wanting.. Varick's father&#xD;
had given him a certain allowance, which was to be withdrawn&#xD;
if he married Miss Romarin; an allowance at that moment in-&#xD;
dispensable to their support: it would appear that they both&#xD;
endured the appearance of an illicit connection, or rather ab-&#xD;
stained from the formal avowal of a marriage which everybody&#xD;
would infer to exist, from the sheer apprehension of want. They&#xD;
lived in great retirement, without even a servant, and had their&#xD;
meals sent in from a restaurant; while, as the Providence which&#xD;
commonly suffers all kinds of irregularities to work their own&#xD;
punishment willed it, at the time of Rosemary's birth, Varick&#xD;
was absent at Washington soliciting a government clerkship,&#xD;
(showing a determination to provide for himself, and 'so infer-&#xD;
ring a marriage, without which he needed no such provision);&#xD;
and the mother, after passing two days without attendance--for&#xD;
the birth of her infant had taken her b surprise-was found on&#xD;
the third delirious and expiring :-it is quite a tragedy. The&#xD;
marks on her linen enabled the charitable strangers who visited&#xD;
her to trace her family. Suffice it that Romarin was sent for,&#xD;
received his daughter's last unconscious sigh and took care of&#xD;
her burial. On her tombstone he caused to be inscribed merely&#xD;
her Christian name, her age, the date of her death, and the name&#xD;
&#xD;
of her parents-leaving a blank space for all other particulars&#xD;
As for Varick Dashon, he returned with disappointment, not&#xD;
knowing his wife's death: for Romarin himself supposed that&#xD;
he had deserted her. What passed between them no one knows ;&#xD;
but they parted in apparent kindness: Varick left his little girl&#xD;
with her maternal grandfather; and, without communicating&#xD;
with his own family, whom he regarded as the authors of hi&#xD;
misfortunes, sailed for Europe. His letters were very brief and&#xD;
far apart; they constantly spoke of Rosemary as his child but&#xD;
neger alluded to Therese except once, where in feeling terms he&#xD;
deplored his "irreparable loss," and expressed the hope of a&#xD;
"reunion in a happier life."&#xD;
Dashon suffered extremely from poverty at first; afterwards&#xD;
he enlisted in the foreign legion of the French army, and was&#xD;
killed i Algeria, in an action where he greatly distinguished&#xD;
himself. His bod v was embalmed by his fellow-officers and sent&#xD;
home; the French government sent his sword and heln and&#xD;
decorations to his parents, with an autograph letter, full of sen-&#xD;
timent, from the Minister of War. Romarin talked a great deal&#xD;
of this, saying with pride: "He is the father of my little girl!"&#xD;
Rosemary (who, however, was always called Mademoiselle Ro.&#xD;
marin) was put into mourning ; and the wealthy Dashons--they&#xD;
Went into deep mourning for their son-adding the weeds with&#xD;
out, to the plrofpunder deuji they had long worn upon the heart.&#xD;
Now it wad, when their only son was actually no more an&#xD;
had died in tle: arms of glory, that the Dashons began to con&#xD;
side whether or not the child he had left, and of whom the&#xD;
had4herto taken no notice, was not after all their legitimate&#xD;
gi child and legal heiress. They were not ignorant of the&#xD;
general ,belief touching the marriage of its parents and the&#xD;
flow as much wished the hypothesis  favorable to the marriage&#xD;
true, as before they had wished an asserted it to be false&#xD;
Pride alone stood in the way of the truth being ascertained-a&#xD;
double pride, the pride of the Dashons, and the pride of Ro-&#xD;
marin. The pride of wealth, which had an immense benefit to&#xD;
confer, stooped first. Old Cornelius Roosevelt Pashon-a kind&#xD;
of Yankee Knickerbocker, Dutch on the mother's side of N&#xD;

Romarin, the French teacher. Romarin divined the object of&#xD;
the visit, and received the grandfather of Rosemary with cahn&#xD;
politeness.&#xD;
My son is dead," said Roosevelt Tashon, icily.&#xD;
" You have my best sympathies, Monsieur," replied Romarin.&#xD;
There is a child," pursued the rich burgess, his voice trem-&#xD;
bling, and also the hand .which rested on a goll-headed cane.&#xD;
" She is ten years obl !" said the poor ex-officer, with an ac-&#xD;
cent which we might call theatric, and which was meant to&#xD;
&amp;amp;craser the other grandpere; as who should say-' Why have&#xD;
you never asked for her before ?"&#xD;
" What--- is she called ?" asked Mr. Dashon, somewhat&#xD;
faintly.&#xD;
"I call her Rose Marie de Romarin," replied the father of&#xD;
Th6tese, sschemrent (as he afterwvards said.)&#xD;
"Was that her mother's name 3" inquired Mr. Dashon, in a&#xD;
gentle voice.&#xD;
Romarin stared, as if at the insolence of this question.&#xD;
"The child is named after her maternal grandmother," he&#xD;
replied at last, "Rose Marie de Floreal, daughter of the feu&#xD;
Marquis de Floreal, of G uadaloupe, and my beloved wife, whose&#xD;
loss I cease not to deplore."&#xD;
"I knew M. de Floreal slightly," said Mr. Dashon, with cour-&#xD;
tesy. "He lost his West-India property in an earthquake or&#xD;
something, I recollect: it was a very singular case. I never&#xD;
knew-what became of his family."&#xD;
"They all married very honest men, though none of them&#xD;
rich," said Romarin, cynically.&#xD;
"Your wife left you only one child, I think ?" sai Mr.&#xD;
Dashon.&#xD;
"But one !" replied Romarin, with a terrible pathos.&#xD;
" I also have lost an only son," said Mr. Dashon, with a mix-&#xD;
ture of irritation and sympathy.-&#xD;
"Who has died, Monsieur, on the field of glory !" responded&#xD;
the old militaire, traighteping himself up. "My daughter-&#xD;
mafine-has died covered with shame, her reputation ruined by&#xD;
you and yours !"&#xD;
There was a silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Let bygones be bygones," said Cornelius Roosevelt Dashon&#xD;
at last. "The past cannot be undone; it is tragical for us both.&#xD;
This child, M. Romarin-it is of her that I would speak. She&#xD;
is all my son has left behind him. I have heard, though I never&#xD;
till now was disposed or able to believe, that Varick was mar-&#xD;
ried to your daughter. If that were really the case, I would&#xD;
acknowledge the little girl, and make her my heir :-in any&#xD;
case---"&#xD;
"Say no more !" cried Romarin, sternly interrupting his&#xD;
visitor. "In any case, I do not part with my grandchild. I&#xD;
have always acknowledged her as mine, though in the eyes of&#xD;
the world, it was the acknowledgment of a daughter's dishonor.&#xD;
My blood runs not in the veins of any other living creature."&#xD;
"Nor mine," said Roosevelt Dashon.&#xD;
"I took her from the bosom of my dying child," said Romarin.&#xD;
"She has grown up ever since upon my knee."&#xD;
"I have had no message; no pledge, of my son since her&#xD;
birth," said Dashon, "till his coffin crossed my threshold."&#xD;
"You desire to know if she is legitimate," pursued Romarin,&#xD;
hotly. That is my secret a moi, monsieur ! Yes, mine ! When&#xD;
I die, you shall know it, if you survive me ; and in that case the&#xD;
child is yours."&#xD;
"This is well; monsieur," said Roosevelt Dashon, white as a&#xD;
sheet. "But the law has something also to say on these points.&#xD;
Your testimony can be required by a court, you will find ; and&#xD;
the question of guardianship will equally be determined by the&#xD;
tribunals. I have the honor to wish you good morning."&#xD;
The two grandfathers parted. The conduct of Romarin may&#xD;
appear a little singular at first sight, but a little knowledge of&#xD;
human nature will cause our surprise at it to cease. If Rose-&#xD;
mary was illegitimate, he did not wish to own it to the haughty&#xD;
and wealthy father of Varick Dashon; if, on the contrary, she&#xD;
was legitimate, a certain pride made him say tpat the repara-&#xD;
tion offered came too late. Moreover, he feared that in the next&#xD;
place a claim might be set up to her custody.&#xD;
"While they hoped that their son might yet return and make&#xD;
ome grand alliance," said Romarin, "little did they care about&#xD;
y poor Rose Marie ; but now that he is dead, they discover&#xD;

my treasure, and would deprive me of it, to solace their selfish&#xD;

It seemed incredible to these grand people that their wishes in&#xD;
regard to the child of their lost son should not be gratified.&#xD;
They considered that they were the injured parties in the&#xD;
calamity which had befallen both families.  Had this young&#xD;
woman not ensnared their son, he would still remain to them.&#xD;
Mrs. Roosevelt Dashon resolved to try her eloquence on Ro-&#xD;
marin, to convince him of his tort. They met for the first time&#xD;
in more than thirty years. A still more elegant carriage than&#xD;
that of Mr. Dashon, drew up at Romarin's humble gate. A lady&#xD;
still handsome, tall, with sweeping black train, and long black&#xD;
veil advanced up the little gravelled walk, and was admitted to&#xD;
the low parlor. M. Romarin received her standing. Her hair&#xD;
was prematurely white, her pale face was printed with the crow&#xD;
feet yet he recognized her. And Isabel Varick knew, not&#xD;
without emotion, the classic features of her handsome music&#xD;
teacher, become more. strongly marked with years, but still&#xD;
eminently noble, with a fire still in the eye, and beauty in the&#xD;
profuse curl of the now silver hair. They were alike in tat&#xD;
ect where once they had differed: for when Romarin's locks&#xD;
wee black as night, Isabel Varick's were of the softest auburn.&#xD;
"Louis !" she said.&#xD;
" Isabel !" said Romarin."&#xD;
-I have come to see you again, and our grandchild," said&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon, always speaking in French.&#xD;
«CBe seated, madame.-you shall see her," said Romarin, con-&#xD;
ducting her to the plain hair sofa.&#xD;
The little girl was sent for and came. It was a d'ark-eyed&#xD;
angel in short black bombazine frock and pantalets. Her black&#xD;
hair fell in ringlets beneath her waist: for it had never been cut.&#xD;
" Oh, Louis !" exclaimed Mrs. Roosevelt----" she is the image&#xD;
of my Varick !"&#xD;
".She resembles strongly father and mother," said Romarin.&#xD;
"How strange, Louis," said Mrs. Dashon, " that your blood&#xD;
fows in the veins of my only living descendant, and mine in&#xD;

spoken of it to any mortal since. The proof I do not possess-&#xD;
but it exists, and I believe that the justice of God will make it&#xD;
known one day: till then let the reputation of the innocent dead&#xD;
remain under the cloud of suspicion."&#xD;
Mrs. Roosevelt Dashon sighed. What was that proof which&#xD;
existed but could not be produced ? Who were those witnesses&#xD;
not dead but wilfully silent? why silent? and why wilfully so?1&#xD;
She gazed on the enchanting face of the youthful Rosemary-too&#xD;
youthful to comprehend this conversation. There were a thou-&#xD;
sand reasons in that face why she should yield entire faith to all&#xD;
that Romarin had said. The charge which rested on the memory&#xD;
of Th6rese Romarin had elicited from those who knew her in child-&#xD;
hood and maidenhood a striking and unanimous testimony to&#xD;
her virtues. No one had ever suspected her of levity ; on the&#xD;
contrary, all bore witness to her modesty, her discretion, her&#xD;
innocence, her charity, her filial piety, and her regular devotion.&#xD;
She was the last girl in the congregation to be suspected of a&#xD;
false step, till her elopement, followed by the birth of a daugh-&#xD;
ter, obscured (such is the force of a consistent good character)&#xD;
rather than tarnished her reputation. All this Mrs. Roosevelt&#xD;
Dashon had heard frequently and sometimes very energetically&#xD;
expressed by Catholic ladies of her own circle ; and it tallied&#xD;
with her father's story.&#xD;
"Eh! bien, Louis," said she, "I am firmly convinced at pre-&#xD;
sent that this is my legitimate grandchild, the only daughter of&#xD;
my only son,.-arid born in wedlock, as much as my son was.&#xD;
It s'agit--the question is-to restore her mother's reputation-&#xD;
is it not ?"&#xD;
Romarin bowed.&#xD;
"What better means for that, Romarin, than for the parents&#xD;
of Varick to acknowledge his child. We shall say -that we&#xD;
have learned from what is equivalent to his dying declaration,&#xD;
that he was lawfully married to Therese de Romarin. Who will&#xD;
question it ?  Meanwhile, we can seek for further and more&#xD;
positive proof of the marriage."&#xD;
"You will do what pleases you, madam. I have not asked&#xD;
for justice or reparation at your hands," said Romarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE GRANDPARENTS'&#xD;
&#xD;
"We shall guarantee the future of our granddaughter "&#xD;
the lady, loftily.&#xD;
"That will be only just to her, madam."&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon had carried every point of th enemy's fo&#xD;
but one. She now boldly assailed that.&#xD;
"You will not be so unreasonable, Louis as to wish tomoo-&#xD;
pohze"-with a slight emphasis--" the possession of the child&#xD;
when we have so large a share in her, and w      e must&#xD;
expect so much from us. It is time," added she, hastily, "to&#xD;
think of her education-one suitable to a great he'rasl am&#xD;
her nearest female relative-her only femnleaeiress--I am&#xD;
these are claims which even you must allow."&#xD;
"She will visit her grandparents of course," said Romarin,&#xD;
his brow darkening.&#xD;
"I will not urge the matter further at present-&#xD;
stand each other perfectly, Louis !" cried Mrs. Roosevelt.&#xD;
"AndlJOZ--you darling !"-addressing the astonished Rosemary&#xD;
-- will you love your granlmamma ? Kiss me m  chi I"&#xD;
You are not my grandnamnma !" cries Rosemary, starting&#xD;
back.  " Voild ma grand' mere ' pointing to aryothful&#xD;
portrait of Mrs. Romarin on the wall. "She is not so old as&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon laughed frankly.&#xD;
"I was as young as that, once, impertinence!  That '&#xD;
grandlmamma Romarin,-do you understand, my dear child. I&#xD;
am your grandmamma Dashon. Your name is Rose M      di&#xD;
you say, Louis ?)-Rose MarieDashon.id&#xD;
"0i, you tell fibs !" cried the child. "My name is Rose&#xD;
Marie Romarin-is it not, grandpa ?"&#xD;
" Romarin was the name of your dear mother m     hil,&#xD;
said Mrs. Roosevelt; "but your father's name was Dashoid,&#xD;
mine."bonlike&#xD;
"That's another fib," said the child angrily. "      '&#xD;
nan e was Trick-est e pas, grandpapa ?   Tous vous moquez&#xD;
de mol, madame."&#xD;
"No, I am not making fun of you, Rose," said Mrs. Dashon.&#xD;
our papa's name was Varick Dashon, and he was my son&#xD;
That makes you my grandchild---do you understand ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
1 75&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6853-00000090"/>&#xD;
The child looked at Romarin, expecting a denial; but seeing&#xD;
that her grandfather's face was grave, and that he neither&#xD;
treated it as a jest, nor denied it; she broke away from her&#xD;
grandmother, ran to him, threw her arms round his neck, buried&#xD;
her face in his bosom, and burst into a passion of tears and&#xD;
violent sobs. -&#xD;
One divines the end of such scenes. The young cirl who&#xD;
cries is sent away to tranquilize herself in private, and the vi-&#xD;
sitor departs. Mrs. Dashon was on the whole satisfied with her&#xD;
progress that day, but she resolved not to rest short of the&#xD;
possession of Rosemary.&#xD;
"You are a stranger now," Romarin observed, in a consola-&#xD;
tory tone, but with evident satisfaction. "By and by she will&#xD;
like you, when she gets accustomed to the idea of other rela-&#xD;
tions than myself."&#xD;
"It is an angel of beauty," said the grandmamma to herself,&#xD;
"but spoiled by that vieux Louis. She has had no bringing up&#xD;
at all, to be so extremely rude on such an occasion."&#xD;
The old Swiss bone, Louise, looked down leaning over the&#xD;
stair, as Mrs. Dashon swept out of the cottage-door.&#xD;

lican, he won't use it. Why should we be opposed to such a&#xD;
marriage as that on the part of our son  She seems to have&#xD;
been an excellent girl, after all, and her virtue was spotless.&#xD;
She would listen to nothing without the ring-do you under-&#xD;
stand ?'-With a short, peculiar scornful laugh, whereby Madam&#xD;
Dashon signified her appreciation of the perfidy and untrust-&#xD;
worthiness of all men.-" She was quite right, eh ? Varick and&#xD;
she went to the bishop together. The bishop was her father-&#xD;
confessor, and as there is no council of Trent in New York&#xD;
(they say), Monseigneur married them, to prevent their marrying&#xD;
themselves, I suppose. Not even old Romarin knew anything&#xD;
about it. Wasn't she a sly puss-that Mademoiselle Romarin ?"&#xD;
.---With another short laugh.-" So after that the affair was&#xD;
managed for them by an old bonne-a Swiss bonne.  Famous&#xD;
ntrigantes all these bonnes.  Never knew one that was other-&#xD;
wise. Elles ne sont faites que pour cela-it is all they are good&#xD;
for ! So after a few months Madame foundlto her innocent sur-&#xD;
prise that her secret could not be kept, and she ran away with&#xD;
my son. The reason she did this was that she so much feared&#xD;
her father's displeasure on account of her secret marriage, and&#xD;
my son feared ours: for Roosevelt had told him that if he mar-&#xD;
ried Miss Romarin he would never see him again ; in fact gave him&#xD;
money on condition he would never see her again, or at least&#xD;
not marry her. This was very wrong of Cornelius ; it was act-&#xD;
ually tempting my son to act in an infamous manner ; so I don't&#xD;
blame Richard much-and the girl, poor thing !-if she commit-&#xD;
ted a fault she atoned for it with her life-she died in child-bed,&#xD;
you know, and my son went to Europe. So, till he was killed,"&#xD;
-Mrs. Dashon wept-very sincere tears-" after performing&#xD;
prodigies of valor in fighting the Arabs, we never knew he was&#xD;
really married. My poor dear boy was the soul of honor,&#xD;
and the idea of havin;   broken  his word to his father&#xD;
preyed upon him. Hencehe kept us in the dark about it for so&#xD;
many years. No doubt he hoped to return full of glory and&#xD;
:           confess it all. Providence ordered it otherwise."-And the old&#xD;
lady lifted a devout glance to Heaven.&#xD;
All Mrs. Dashon's five hundred dear friends, of both sexes,&#xD;
understood it perfectly. They agreed with her also that she&#xD;

&#xD;
had a perfect title to the possession and education of her rand&#xD;

rin, entreating him to return to France and give him the benefit&#xD;
of his able services and fidelity a routes spreuwes. This was too&#xD;
much for an ancient officer of the grand army, and a beneficiary&#xD;
of Napoleon I. Romarin resolved to accept, or as he said, to&#xD;
obey the prince's invitation, and he' at first thought to take his&#xD;
grandchild with him, but on reflection, in the great uncertainty&#xD;
of political events and of the prince's fortunes, this seemed so&#xD;
unjust to Rose Marie herself, that he adopted the a ise resolution&#xD;
of making at this moment a graceful concession to the Dashons.&#xD;
In a month after the receipt of the prince's letter, Romarin&#xD;
bade adieu to his weeping granddaughter on the deck of the&#xD;
Havre steamer, and she was borne away from the vessel's side&#xD;
in the carriage of her grandmamma Dashon, as inconsolable as&#xD;
a nature half French would permit her to be, and as demon-&#xD;
strative of her grief as an education wholly French would neces-&#xD;
sitate her being, at the age of eleven. Grandpapa and grand-&#xD;
mamma Dashon, whom natural anxiety as well as their high sense&#xD;
of decorum had induced to visit the steamer in person and&#xD;
receive their grandchild from the hands of their departing rival,&#xD;
endeavored to console her: but this angel in short skirts plainly&#xD;
showed that she inherited the quick passions which had got her&#xD;
parents and grandparents into scrapes, she flung away from&#xD;
their caresses with temper, and burying her face in the bosom&#xD;
of her dear bonne, sobbed without restraint.&#xD;
Scarce was this pathetic ebullition of temper well over, before&#xD;
it was necessary to stop at Romarin's former cottage. Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon had requested permission to fit out her granddaughter&#xD;
on occasion of her going out of mourning, but this offer had&#xD;
been respectfully declined by Romarin. The sale of' his pianO'&#xD;
and noble c action of music had produced a sum sufficient to&#xD;
provide for this slight expense, and still leave enough for his&#xD;
passage to France and support during the first year: the rest&#xD;
he trusted to that bonapartist Providence known as the star of&#xD;
Napoleon. He might have had other means, had it not inter-&#xD;
ested his pride not to send Rose Marie portionless to her proud&#xD;
paternal relatives. Scanty as Romarin's income had been, French&#xD;
economy had enabled him to lay up something every year, and&#xD;
the cottage ii which he lived, with the little garden attached to&#xD;
&#xD;
it, situated in a district poor enough when&#xD;
now rapidly filling with magnificent rehepurchased it, but&#xD;

included a longer line of fine windows, with a small extension,&#xD;
and the lofty stone screen of the back-court, and the architec-&#xD;
tural entrance of the stables. As the little Rosemary ascended&#xD;
the easy steps to the open vestibule, she was sensible, young as&#xD;
she was, of a mighty transformation in her fortunes. She was,&#xD;
then, the sole descendant and heiress of this merchant prince !&#xD;
A footman in livery had stood behind the coach ; another&#xD;
threw open the glass door of the vestibule. Before her stretched&#xD;
a marble hall, with a grand painted staircase leaving it on one side,&#xD;
springing aloft in great sweeps, but not breaking the vista, and&#xD;
at the further extremity an arch, and beyond that another, open-&#xD;
ing into a conservatory where a fountain played among bright&#xD;
flowers and birds in cages.&#xD;
On her right, as she entered, a door was open into a inrary,&#xD;
all lined with dark rich book-cases,,and looking to the north.&#xD;
On her left another, which her grandparents entered. It wag a&#xD;
sumptuous recoptiog room, with a large window on the Avenue&#xD;
and another on the garden. The draperies were dark blue; 'in&#xD;
the avenue window stood a magnificent bronze; the garden win-&#xD;
dow had a stone balcony : the mantelpiece was opposite the&#xD;
avenue window, and over it was a huge mirror, in which you&#xD;
could see the persons passing on the opposite side of the street.&#xD;
An arched door, tall and narrow, in the recess, conducted into&#xD;
the next room, whither Rosemary's grandparents led on. It&#xD;
was'onger, had one large Venetian window of three lights look-&#xD;
ing upon the garden, with a balcony and a flight of stone steps.&#xD;
In a deep recess at one end an oaken buffet or sideboard, pro-&#xD;
fusely carved ; on the walls pictures of game and numerous&#xD;
engravings; an. oaken wainscot all round, and a carved fire-&#xD;
place; a ceiling in compartments of gold and purple ; a gilt&#xD;
chandelier dependent, beneath which a table was set for dinner.&#xD;
The draperies were purple.&#xD;
"We dine at five," said grandmamma, and passed on to the&#xD;
next room, by a door exactly corresponding to that by which&#xD;
they had entered. There was a sort of arched passage, indeed,&#xD;
with dark-paneled and fragrant cedar closets on either hand;&#xD;
and the room was a bedroom, grandmamma's own bedroom;&#xD;
&#xD;
and here Louise took off Rosemary's Leghorn flat and&#xD;
mantle. This was the exact arrangement (but Rose Marie did&#xD;
iot know that till her grandmamnma said so) of a great mansion&#xD;
in Europe--a suite of living apartments terminating ia  mansion&#xD;

vered in part with a rich Persian carpet. The curtains of the&#xD;
bed and window, being of rose velvet, were cut in formal medi-&#xD;
eval points. But nothing could be snugger than that Maltese&#xD;
window, half shut in by curtains, a richly cushioned seat run-&#xD;
ning all round it, the sunlight pouring in at one or two open&#xD;
panels, a view of the garden and Avenue through another ;&#xD;
nothing more picturesque and quiet than the little "chamber&#xD;
within, with its one high light, and its antique furniture. We&#xD;
hope the reader wil bear in mind this description; for here will&#xD;
occur the catastrophe of this story.&#xD;
-" I had this chamber fitted up merely as a curious show, to&#xD;
amuse my lady friends when they called," said grandmamma&#xD;
Dashon ; "but now I shall put it to use : it is your room, my&#xD;
dear,-next to mine, you see-I like to have my little girl&#xD;
under my own eye, do you understand ?-Still, you can get out,&#xD;
if you like, without passing through my room. See here,&#xD;
petite! This door, you observe, leads into the bath-room, and&#xD;
this"-passing on through another arched passage with cedar&#xD;
closets,-" into the small conservatory."&#xD;
In fact, following her grandmother, Rosemary saw the same&#xD;
fountain playing among the brilliant flowers and birds in cages,&#xD;
which had caught her eye as the termination of the vista of the&#xD;
hall. The birds were singing merrily, and in the marble basin&#xD;
of the fountain gold and silver fish were swimming. A beau-&#xD;
tiful tawney hound of choice breed sprang forward and leaped&#xD;
up on the little girl's dress.-" Oh, how pretty !" she exclaimed.&#xD;
-" Perhaps you would like to see the house ?" inquired&#xD;
grandmamma.&#xD;
"If that does not derange you at all, madame ?" replied the&#xD;
young lady, still in French.&#xD;
They went into the hail, the end of which was fitted up as an&#xD;
anteroom. "Which is the communication, you observe, be-&#xD;
tween your grandpapa's room and mine," said grandmamma,&#xD;
"and if you remove the cushions from that turkish divan, you&#xD;
will discover a marble bath, with hot and cold water."&#xD;
In the hall they were joined by grandpapa. His cane clat-&#xD;
tered over the marble floor: for he was lame with gout. They&#xD;
mount the grand staircase very leisurely on his account. Rose-&#xD;
&#xD;
mary thought of grandpapa Romarin who, tho     *&#xD;
eighth year, could mount a stair like a young man  "Wealth "&#xD;
thought she, "does not keep people from growing old: this&#xD;
rich grandpapa of mine is as stiff in his jointsas ro   old: Lau&#xD;
rent who asks alms at the church door."&#xD;
The stair was stately with bust and statue&#xD;
abundant light showers down;   d h    e, on which the soft&#xD;
columned and paved with marble. One enters an tecpper,&#xD;
which, like the one below, looks into a conservatory but a much&#xD;
more stately one, filled, with tall rare plants, and the sun ahmuch&#xD;
brightly in among e thehe. sunneshmnmg&#xD;
brigtly inrom  t  . On one side of the antechamber is the&#xD;
"state bedroom."&#xD;
" What is a state bedroom ?" asked Roe&#xD;
fine rooms below have nothing  smar ; for all the&#xD;
"It is one that is used only for very illus&#xD;
the President, if he shudnyfrvr      llstrious guests, like&#xD;
ersin            shouldvisit us, or for a bride--do you&#xD;
understand ?"                                        3&#xD;
"Or Prince Louis ?" said the little girl&#xD;
Exactly, my dear : but as no such visitor is very likely to&#xD;
come, I have reserved this apartment in my own mind for another&#xD;
occasion,"&#xD;
"What is that, grandmamma ?"&#xD;
"Your wedding,.my little girl."&#xD;
The mantelpiece of this room had a singular&#xD;
winged fig-usrrom               adn  smular design. Two&#xD;
Winedfgures in white marble supported the slab, which was&#xD;
festooned with flowers-..on one side Hymen; o  h  tewt&#xD;
torch reversed, thw esnonAge  f   ton the other, with&#xD;

really very curious was that in the centre ont       s&#xD;
in antique raised letters, was the  rd  O a smooth scroll,&#xD;
"What is that, grandmamma? " asked the       -&#xD;
"Josemcary is for remembrance," said the rd   r.&#xD;
the design signifies 'Life and Death.'"&#xD;
Next grandmamma called her attention&#xD;
fair-haired, handsome young man in a fireman's dress ; in the&#xD;
backgrou a house on fire and a very long ladder placed against ,&#xD;
one of the upper windows.&#xD;

{n     "That is my son!" said the old lady, with a quivering lip.&#xD;
Grandpnpa's hand trembled resting on his cane.&#xD;
The little French girl dropped on one knee and clasped her&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
-" Ah! it is my papa!"&#xD;
After looking at it earnestly, with a great deal of sentiment,&#xD;
for a few minutes, she rose quickly and threw herself first in&#xD;
the arms of one grandparent, then of the other: it was quite a&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
"I will have your -mother's portrait framed to match this,&#xD;
and hung in the recess on the other side," said grandmamma.&#xD;
Recrossing the antechamber they advanced into a cabinet-&#xD;
that is, a saloon of moderate dimensions sparkling with objects of&#xD;
vertu ; it has two windows on the garden and one into the con-&#xD;
servatory, and the last is in a range with the line of arched&#xD;
doors of the suite, so that you see the whole length of the state&#xD;
apartments on that side ; but there are no folding-doors-" they&#xD;
are vulgar !" says grandmamma. This room is paneled in grey&#xD;
satin in borders of blue and gold. Next is the "winter draw-&#xD;
ing-room ;"-a larger room which corresponds to the dining-&#xD;
room below, all crimson and gold, with a magnificent oriel win-&#xD;
dow, stone mullioned; the walls hung with numerous pictures.&#xD;
Here was a splendid full-length of Cornelius Roosevelt Dashon,&#xD;
Esquire, in his library, in the attitude of Scott at Abbotsford, read-&#xD;
ing the courier and Enquirer Shipping List; the paper turned&#xD;
over so as to display the word TEAS in large capitals at the head&#xD;
of an advertisement; and just below, a steamship ; i'ndidating the&#xD;
great branches of trade with which his name was connected: on&#xD;
the table a map of his real estate. Ancient India merchant (the&#xD;
globe at his feet showed the coast of China uppermost), chief&#xD;
owner of a line of ocean steamers, great landed proprietors&#xD;
And now grandpapa, who seemed greatly comforted since he&#xD;
had surmounted the difficulty of the stair, and also by the embrace&#xD;
of his grandchild, led on gaily to the last apartment of the suite&#xD;
-the salon or" great drawing-room." It extended across the en-&#xD;
tire front of the house and had two ranges of windows; over the&#xD;
chief entrance was a music gallery, accessible from the story&#xD;
above. Rosemary looked up in wonder to the lofty, coved and&#xD;
&#xD;

painted ceiling, whence depended a chandelier where knights and&#xD;
ames with horse and hound chased the deer in a forest of frosted&#xD;
silver; then gland at the walls glowing with arabesques and&#xD;
 withnumerous mirrors reflecting t&#xD;
majesty and loveliness of sculpture, or down at the vast ir&#xD;
quetted floor laid but not covered with Turkey rugs andvast par-&#xD;
nd lading the eye to various brilliant objects--vases taller t&#xD;
herself, cabinets, luxurious seats of regal splendor. On the&#xD;
whole the effect was simple though magnificent And th&#xD;
Rosemary, fresh from  Romarin's humble cottae--was she&#xD;
indeed, as she had been told again and again b&#xD;
heiress of all this ?ainy3Louise, the&#xD;
Perhaps it was not the wisest thing in the world f&#xD;
rich grandparents to show this child all these splendors these&#xD;
first moment. It would have been better to treat her likey ty&#xD;
child that she was-under twelve years--a half-pric  e&#xD;
whose cf treat had been a three cent ride in an omnibus&#xD;
would learn her new position soon enough. Nor was it the&#xD;
surest way to her heart.  The vulgar pride of we ilth was&#xD;
brought rather too suddenly to bear upon a pride perhaps not&#xD;
Creator but more honored by men.&#xD;
--" what think you of this, Rose ?" asked her grandfat&#xD;
whne e young lady had sufficiently, as he thought, sated er&#xD;
wonder.,                                            he&#xD;
That young person stood in the middle of the grand so&#xD;

dress.                                   hrsml      ht&#xD;
-" It is very well, monsieur," said she at length, with grave&#xD;
osi sacy: "'but my grandpapa is going to see the Tuileries&#xD;

"And what is *'this ''" demanded Mrs. Dashon, half vexed,&#xD;
half amused. "Something very complimentary, Roosevelt, no&#xD;
doubt."&#xD;
"This is the way old Romarin has taught the little French&#xD;
monkey to regard us !" said grandpapa Dashon. "Well, what&#xD;
is your-Yankee grandpapa ? pray finish, child."&#xD;
" My Yankee grandpapa is .a rich gentleman," replied Rose-&#xD;
mary, grievously offended to hear her French grandpapa styled&#xD;
old Romarin. "I don't like rich gentlemen--I like poor brave&#xD;
men !"&#xD;
"Take your young lady to her room, and dress her for&#xD;
dinner," said Mrs. Dashon to Louise. "It is truly an enfant&#xD;
terrible. Ha! ha! But we must put up with this impertinence&#xD;
at first, till ma-de-moi-selle finds out on which side her bread is&#xD;
buttered-eh t She has been taught this (the pert little par.&#xD;
rot!) by that dreadful vieux Louis !-do you understand '&#xD;
"The old boy take him!" said grandpapa Dashon, piously.&#xD;
"Amen !" was the charitable response of grandmamma Da-&#xD;
shon. "That is, I wish he were in Heaven !"&#xD;
As Louis Napoleon had got the man, some might think that&#xD;
Mr. Dashon need wish poor Romarin no worse ; but as he was&#xD;
gone to Paris,a Frenchman might think that Mrs. Dashon could&#xD;
wish him nothing better.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
NEW AND OLD CHARACTERS.&#xD;
IT will be necessary to say something about the education of&#xD;
our little heroine previous to this date. One easily understands&#xD;
that it was economy joined to the love of independence, a gar-&#xD;
den and fresh air, that first induced Romarin to rent the cottage&#xD;
in the purchase of which he afterwards invested his slender&#xD;
savings. The household consisted of himself, the child, the&#xD;
bonne, and a nanny-goat, which fed in the court-yard, and&#xD;
browsed on the grassy hill near by. The hill was still crowned&#xD;
with a grove, and the old rock -cropped out on the declivity.&#xD;
Before Romarin left, a street had been carried right through the&#xD;
hill: at the present date the spot is a brown-stone paradise.&#xD;
The baby throve on the milk of the nanny-goat, who in time&#xD;
became the little girl's chief companion and playmate. The&#xD;
goat was a wonderful climber, and Rosemary became a wonder-&#xD;
ful climber too. Nanette and the child would mount from a&#xD;
low bench to the roof of an ash-house; thence to that of the&#xD;
kitchen, then to the very ridge of the cottage, and return by&#xD;
the window of the attic. This might be hereditary propensity,&#xD;
for they say her father had often performed the same feat. It&#xD;
was vain to scold and punish, where Nanette went Rose Marie&#xD;
feared not to go, and vice ,versa. The girl indeed could climb&#xD;
where the goat could not--into the cherry-trees, for instance.--&#xD;
"Pity she's not a boy !" grandpapa would say: "how that&#xD;
would scale a rampart !"-And what with climbing and drinking&#xD;
goat's milk and devouring fresh vegetables and ripe fruits and&#xD;
occasionally a cotelette or bnfstek, the little girl grew up fair,&#xD;
strong and active, with a full plump chest, a lithe and supple&#xD;
figure and limbs of vigorous symmetry.&#xD;
Her sole teacher was her grandpapa, and the education he&#xD;

&#xD;
. gave her was excellent, although it would in some respects have&#xD;
been more suitable for a loy. Yet much that was proper for&#xD;
her sex came quite naturally under the tuition of that accom-&#xD;
plished Romarin. At seven Rose Marie could dance like a&#xD;
sylphide, and already had learned to spread he;nfantile digits&#xD;
over the octaves of her grandpapa's piano. She evinced great&#xD;
talent for music, which she had great opportunities to cultivate.&#xD;
Romarin attended all the fine concerts, and as soon as she was&#xD;
old enough to sit out the performance, Rosemary accompanied&#xD;
him. The society at the cottage was wholly of an artistic kind.&#xD;
Then every Sunday the grandpapa and little granddaughter&#xD;
heard High Mass in the French Church, where Romarin always&#xD;
frequented the choir and sometimes played the organ. It is&#xD;
superfluous to observe that Rosemary was mistress of French,&#xD;
as no other language was spoken in the family. English she&#xD;
spoke with a perfectly pure accent, although she had learned it&#xD;
entirely from her grandfather, whose foreign accent was very&#xD;
marked : it is a marvel where children pick up the native accent&#xD;
o' the country they live in. From some of her grandfather's&#xD;
musical friends she had early acquired the Ital an pronunciation&#xD;
and a variety of conversational phrases, while others taught her&#xD;
to babble in German and sing German songs. Thus the little&#xD;
girl had such mastery as such a child can attain of the principal&#xD;
modern languages. Grammar, history, geography she learned&#xD;
in the manuals of the military schools of France; she could&#xD;
draw maps beautifully, and was skilled in perspective; she&#xD;
could sketch a little, paint flowers, hem her own pocket-hand-&#xD;
kerchiefs, and darn her own and her grandpa's stockings, cook&#xD;
a cutlet, make coffee and bake bread. She had also read the&#xD;
campaigns of Napoleon with maps, and knew the hero's career&#xD;
by heart, she could describe the day of Austerlitz, and explain&#xD;
the defeat of Waterloo. But all these were comparative&#xD;
recreations: the study on which her grandfather insisted was&#xD;
mathematics. . At ten Rosemary was mistre s of arithmetic ;'at&#xD;
eleven she could evolve a binomial ; at eleven and six months&#xD;
could demonstrate the 47th Proposition of the First Book.&#xD;
It was with deep regret that Romarin saw himself obliged to&#xD;
interrupt this well-considered education: but he knew that in&#xD;
&#xD;
Paris he should not be able to carry it on in person,'tnd mas-&#xD;
ters he could not afford. However, he merely stipulated with&#xD;
the Dashons, that if they sent the child to school, it should be&#xD;
to the Sacred Heart. As Romarin was a perfect philosophe and&#xD;
had somewhat neglected Rosemary's religious education, it is&#xD;
likely that national prejudice had more to do with this choice&#xD;
than anxiety for her faith. It was Louise who taught the child&#xD;
her prayers and catechism, took her to confession at eight, and&#xD;
saw that she made her first communion at ten years. Louise&#xD;
was as far aspossible from being an intrigante, as grandmanma&#xD;
Dashon insinuated; she was the most honest and simple-hearted&#xD;
woman in the world; in her neat shawl and embroidered white&#xD;
muslin cap, with broad ruffles beautifully quilled, framing her&#xD;
high-colored round face, she never missed early Mass and sel-&#xD;
dom Vespers, to which she took Rosemary. It was she who&#xD;
taught the child, perhaps in plainer language than a high-bred&#xD;
mother would, but all the more wholesome for that, her moral&#xD;
duties; and if she sometimes flattered her vanity; or stimulated&#xD;
her ambition, and indulged her self-will, you could hardly ex-&#xD;
pect more from a simple bonnie.&#xD;
Except that she always missed and lamented her French&#xD;
grandpapa, whom a Yankee grandpapa and granrimamma both&#xD;
could not for a long time replace, the child soon discovered the&#xD;
immense superiority of her new home in a child's point of view.&#xD;
Grandpapa Dashon's garden was not only three times as large as&#xD;
grandpapa Romarin's, but infinitely more agreeable as a play&#xD;
ground, to say nothing of its brilliant flowers and delicious&#xD;
fruits. The streets were incomparably jleasanter, and she had&#xD;
now companions of her own age with whom she was permitted&#xD;
1 to associate. - They trundled their hoops on the broad sidewalks,&#xD;
and sometimes in the neighboring square; and even Nanette&#xD;
found a rival in a mooley cow, sweet-breath'd and full-uddered,&#xD;
which while the green grass lasted in the court-yard was allowed&#xD;
to crop it night and morning.&#xD;
In respect o.f climbing there were glorious diversions in store&#xD;
for her. The court de derriere, as Madam Dashon in her French&#xD;
affectation called what common people term the back-yard, was&#xD;
four or five feet below the level of the street and garden, and&#xD;

paved. From this paved court to the garden there was neces-&#xD;
sarily a flight of steps. Here a wide and lofty arch let in the&#xD;
sun, and its shadow ever slept upon the pavement. On the brown&#xD;
stone wall above, connecting the extension with the stables,&#xD;
there were huge pots of cactus over the pillars. Outside the&#xD;
stables a narrow. winding stair of stone led to the flat stable&#xD;
roof. Vases filled with cactus crowned its massive balustrade,&#xD;
It was the delight of Rosemary and her companion to pass per-&#xD;
petually up and down these flights of steps; all young animals&#xD;
do the same; when she was in the court she wanted to get upon&#xD;
the roof; when on the roof, she immediately desired to descend&#xD;
into the court, then to ascend to the garden, and so back. But&#xD;
one bold enterprise long tempted her ; it was to cross on the top&#xD;
of the high wall from the root of the stables to that of the ex.&#xD;
tension : there was no obstacle but the dizzy height and the&#xD;
pots of cactus, one over each pillar of the arch, that guarded&#xD;
the access. On one side were the steps leading up to the gar-&#xD;
dens, on the other, twenty-five feet below the pavement of the&#xD;
kitchen court. One day she attempted it; they passed success-&#xD;
fully the great vase of cactus. Now the child is safe if she&#xD;
keeps her head-if she lose it for an instant, that fluttering&#xD;
white frock will cover a lifeless form on the pavement down&#xD;
there, and the black ringlets will be matted with blood on the&#xD;
stone steps. They pass safely, but how to return ?-the child&#xD;
and the goat can hardly turn. They are at no loss. Over the&#xD;
extension is the conservatory, which has a sash open. To&#xD;
clamber in here was the grand object. The playmates enter&#xD;
the antechamber of the grand suite, and then the state bed-&#xD;
room; Nanette goes first, and Rosemary, laughing'and chatter-&#xD;
ing French, follows her four-footed and silent friend. The little&#xD;

&#xD;
was truly a new life for the grandchild of Romarin to go shop-&#xD;
ping withgrandmamma Dashon. A magnificent coach conveys&#xD;
them to their destination; a footman opens the door when they&#xD;
alight; obsequious shopmen think nothing trouble that gratifies&#xD;
a whim of either. Grandmuamma was dressy and expensive: it&#xD;
was her taste, and she could afford it. Rosemary's simple white&#xD;
(she had never worn any thing else till she put on mourning)&#xD;
was soon exchanged for radiaut silks and velvets of every hue.&#xD;
A butterfly is beautiful fluttering from flower to flower; so is a&#xD;
little girl in a gay dress on the broad flagging, or the high stone&#xD;
steps of that superb street, where the little girls play ed and&#xD;
flitted from house to house, and inspected each other's costumes&#xD;
with premature womanly airs, in the afternoons, while the soft&#xD;
bright days of autumn permitted.&#xD;
But the year grew dark, and the days both cold and brief;&#xD;
a fortnight at grandpa's farm in Westchester abbreviated the&#xD;
autumn ; the Christmas holidays came, after which it was proposed&#xD;
that the little lady should resume her studies; and in the mean-&#xD;
time Mr. Dashon proposed to give a large family dinner party,&#xD;
in order to introduce his grandchild more formally to her rela-&#xD;
tives, some of whom were extremely chary of their courtesies&#xD;
to the new-found heiress. Among this class of Mr..Dashon's&#xD;
connections the marriage of Rosemary's parents still found&#xD;
skeptics. One family even affected to doabt her being Varick&#xD;
Dashon's child at all. Those who took this view were the rela-&#xD;
tives of Mrs. Dashon, the numerous and powerful family of the&#xD;
Varicks. Mr. Dashon himself had but one blood relation who&#xD;
could be prejudiced by the acknowledgment of his grandchild.&#xD;
This was a niece, daughter of his only brother, and brought up&#xD;
in her uncle's family as a daughter. Before Dick Dashon had&#xD;
his grand affair with Mlle. Romarin, it was thought that these&#xD;
cousins would marry ; in the midst of it, however, Isabel&#xD;
Dashon (named after her aunt-in-law) married too, and fortu-&#xD;
nately for her a Varick, so that all the family were interested in&#xD;
supporting her claims. The idea was that the little Romarin&#xD;
(as she was called) being considered a mere side-slip, and pro-&#xD;
vided for at best by a handsome legacy, if Varick Dashon died&#xD;
abroad unmarried (as seemed likely), Mrs. George Varick (of&#xD;
&#xD;
whom the reader knows something), as next of kin to Mr.&#xD;
Dashon, would inherit all that portion of his vast property, viz. :&#xD;
the whole real estate and half the personalty, which the law, if&#xD;
he died intestate, would give her as his brother's child; while&#xD;
the remainder, falling to Mrs. Dashon as widow-it was an&#xD;
understood thing that she should survive her husband--would&#xD;
be distributed at her death among her brothers and sisters and&#xD;
their descendants.&#xD;
But in thus cutting up Mr. Cornelius Roosevelt Dashon before&#xD;
his time, the Varicks evidently reckoned without their host, as&#xD;
what we have just related concerning his recognition of Rose-&#xD;
mary proves. They had received her, as we have said, very&#xD;
coldly. Mrs. Dashon's brothers and sisters to be sure had not&#xD;
failed to call upon their little relative, if only from a motive of&#xD;
curiosity ; but Mrs. George Varick had hitherto neglected to do&#xD;
so. It is true she had been at Newport when Rosemary was&#xD;
brought home by her grandparents, but some weeks had&#xD;
elapsed since her return and she had only dropped a card at&#xD;
her aunt's on a day when Mrs. Dashon and Rosemary were out&#xD;
-a single card, not even turned down in the mysterious form&#xD;
which signifies for "all the ladies ;" and grandmamma Dashon&#xD;
vexed "at this impertinence-do you understand 'I" returned&#xD;
the visit a few days after by sending her own card in an enve-&#xD;
lope by a servant to "Mrs. Geo. Varick." There was no love&#xD;
lost betwixt this aunt and niece-in-law, in spite of their dupli-&#xD;
cated affinity: but Mr. Dashon loved his niece and invited her&#xD;
with her husband to the dinner. He had better not: there are&#xD;
some people who are less dangerous as open foes than as nomi-&#xD;
nal friends.&#xD;
The hour was five, The Dashons received their guests in the&#xD;
library, and as the sun set that day at 4.40, it was already dark&#xD;
It was a very fine apartment, lined with the most beautiful&#xD;
book-cases in the city, and had but one defect considered as a&#xD;
library--there were very few books in it. To remedy this the&#xD;
cases were ingeniously contrived to show only half the shelves,&#xD;
which part being carefully filled, the collection appeared to be&#xD;
superb. But the company on this occasion were rich rather&#xD;

than learned, and perhaps appreciated the magnificent cases&#xD;
more than they would have done the books.&#xD;
Yet was not Dr. Varick there, brother of grandmamma Dashon&#xD;
and Professor of-well, no matter what he was professor of--in&#xD;
the " Hokack Medical College ?" He was a learned man, or at&#xD;
least a learned physician, with the largest practice in the city&#xD;
in the department where his skill, science and experience were&#xD;
supposed to be conspicuous. Undoubtedly there was not a&#xD;
doctor in the metropolis whose buggy was seen to stand (and&#xD;
sometimes to remain for hours) before so many first-class, brown-&#xD;
stone fronts as Dr. Edward Varick's, He had ushered half the&#xD;
rising generation of the Fifth avenue district into the world, ard&#xD;
it was a strong evidence to his mind that our Rosemary had&#xD;
made her entrance into it .n the wrong side of the blanket (as&#xD;
the saying is), that he had not officiated at her birth. Dr. Varick&#xD;
was not particularly intellectual in his appearance, though he&#xD;
wore spectacles; but he was remarkably neat in his dress, es-&#xD;
pecially so about his .wristbands, and his hands were always&#xD;
white as snow (a figurative expression to convey their unsullied&#xD;
-    cleanness); points which the ladies, Dr. V. considered, were&#xD;
sure to notice in a gentleman in "my line of profession."&#xD;
Then (what was I thinking of just now'?) there was the Rev.&#xD;
Dr. Clerestory, Rector of St. Hubert's, the fashionable church of&#xD;
the city, and brother-in-law of Mrs. Dashon and the preceding.&#xD;
Dr. Clerestory was a solid divine and himself owned a fine&#xD;
library of the Fathers. I know it because I have often heard&#xD;
him speak of Chrysostom as a favorite author of his. He also&#xD;
had a professional reason for doubting the marriage of Rose-&#xD;
mary's parents: for it was clearly a thing that belonged at least&#xD;
to the rule of "decently and in 'order" that a young man of&#xD;
Varick Dashon's position in society should be married at St.&#xD;
Hubert's, either by himself or the bishop. Dr. Clerestory had&#xD;
not a bad ;head; it was bald, rathei- massive, with gray thick&#xD;
locks over the ears; the face was shrewd, sly and indicative of&#xD;
sensibility. In the pulpit he was vehement and eloquent. Al-&#xD;
though he had a highly fashionable congregation-for a box at&#xD;
the opera and a pew at St. Hubert's were equally symbols of a&#xD;
fashionable family,-no one could denounce the spirit of the&#xD;

world and all its vices and follies, more impartially, constantly&#xD;
or-energetically than he; nor did this plainness of speech ever&#xD;
give offence ; on the contrary, the more Dr. Clerestory lashed&#xD;
their worldliness, their devotion to pleasure and show, their&#xD;
extravagance in living, dress and equipage, the round of parties,&#xD;
the useless life, the novel-reading, the vices of youth of both&#xD;
sexes, and so forth, the more popular he grew; so that it really&#xD;
seemed as if, like some Catholic penitents i Lnt t itnrey&#xD;
gation of St. Hubert's desired to atone for the dissipationand&#xD;
boundless frivolity, the devotion to Mammon an 1I the unscru-&#xD;
pulous ritual of his servicevall the othcr days of the weekly&#xD;
listening wh great self-complacency to Dr. Clerestory's denun-&#xD;
ciation of their Course on Sunday. It was a dish served up to&#xD;
-tcame, atl sevedt withgreat regularity, as often as the day&#xD;
came, and served hot, wth the richest condiments of satire and&#xD;
inactive, in a voice whose piercing quality ought to have&#xD;
awakened the most careless sinner, and that produced a thrill&#xD;
in the sensitive nature, which perhaps the trembling but de-&#xD;
lighted auditors mistook for repentance. The congregation&#xD;
then turned out on the sidewalk, a stream of beautiful dresses,&#xD;
feeling better for their weekly castigation, like children who&#xD;
have been voluptuously whipped, and returned to their former&#xD;
ways with renewed relish. This reverend gentleman was rather&#xD;
silent in company, as fluent speakers and ready writers often&#xD;
are; but he could talk on occasion, and great weight was attri-&#xD;
buted to the remarks which then fell from his lips; he was&#xD;
servant, polished, courteous, and a dextrous listener; and his&#xD;
wife, the Rev. Mrs. Clerestory, sister of course of Mrs. Dashon,&#xD;
was sufficiently voluble to more than atone for the taciturnity&#xD;
of her spouse. Then there were Mr. and Mrs. Abram Varick--&#xD;
Mr. A. V. was the present chief of the firm of Varick &amp;amp; Co.,.&#xD;
formerly Daslhoi &amp;amp; Variek ; and some junior members of the&#xD;
several families. There were also a pair of professional friends&#xD;
of the family ; namely, firt, the Hon. Daniel Plaidoyer, ex-&#xD;
member of Congress and Mr. Dashon's confidential lawyer, the&#xD;
depositary of his will, and whose opinion, very decidedly ex-&#xD;
pressed in favor of the legitimacy of our little heroine, had&#xD;
greatly influenced the Varicks in the determination they had&#xD;

come to, of accepting her heirship as a faith accompli; and&#xD;
secondly.-but this gentleman deserves a fresh pen and a new&#xD;
paragraph.&#xD;
We have had the opportunity of becoming acquainted with&#xD;
some of the means, not always he nicest or the most just, by&#xD;
which Dr. Ezekiel Mannikin launched himself into a leading&#xD;
metropolitan practice-how he got his fine four-story house on&#xD;
Broadway and its fine furniture, his handsome brougham, his&#xD;
black fellow to drive it, atid so forth. These externals could&#xD;
not alone have secured his object in so short a time. Ezekiel&#xD;
had early perceived the importance of a "speciality," and that&#xD;
for which he appreciated in himself a certain predilection was&#xD;
toxicology. . Since Orfila no one ever knew so much about poi-&#xD;
sons. His experiments in corpore vili--in dogs, cats, rats, rab-&#xD;
bits, &amp;amp;c., were thorough affairs, and he reported them for the&#xD;
"Hosack Medical and Surgical Journal," with a cynical minute-&#xD;
ness which proved him to be a man of genuine science. Next,&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin pulbished a book-a thick and costly o ctavo with&#xD;
plates-" Mannikin on Poisons," =comprising his own experi-&#xD;
ments, and showing a truly wonderful acquaintance with the&#xD;
history of accidental and criminal poisoning. Departing from&#xD;
the beaten track of medical works, he related the cases with&#xD;
romantic details which rendered the book popular beyond the&#xD;
limits of the profession, By sending copies, with a $5 bill en-&#xD;
closed, he had got it noticed in all the leading papers in the&#xD;
Union ; the metropolitan journals under different influences&#xD;
gave long reviews of it with appetizing extracts: the Herald&#xD;
gave it the benefit of a savage editorial attack, so worded as to&#xD;
inflame the curiosity which causes the accounts of prize fights&#xD;
and criminal trials to be eagerly read: the fortune of the book&#xD;
was made and Dr. Mannikin became famous.&#xD;
In every career there is a woman who does something for a&#xD;
man which he could never do for himself. Dr. Manniki's good&#xD;
feminine genius was a relative of the Dashons, as we are aware.&#xD;
How much of his success be owed to her no one can tell. Didn't&#xD;
she indirectly procure him his desirable house and fine furiui-&#xD;
ture, his handsome brougham and smart black boy ? Did she&#xD;
'not get her uncle Dr. Varick to adopt Dr. Mannikin as his con-&#xD;
&#xD;
suiting physician'? Was it not her high recommendation (in-&#xD;
spired by affection for her dear uncle) which induced grandpapa&#xD;
Dashon to consult him for his goutI And was it not in conse-&#xD;
quence of his marked success in this instance that grandmatnma&#xD;
Dashon (much as she disliked taking up any pet of her niece)&#xD;
had lately employed him in preference to her own brother'&#xD;
And who smoothed over, if she could not wholly extinguish, the&#xD;
natural jealousy which this caused in the Varick connection ?&#xD;
Mrs. George Varick at this time stood well with all the world.&#xD;
Her husband had returned from California some f9ur years&#xD;
previous with (people said) half a million in gold dust, and a&#xD;
beard a foot long. He had paid his old debts ; his debts of&#xD;
honor in. full; his notes he cleverly bought in, through the&#xD;
agency of a broker, at an average of fifteen per cent, on their&#xD;
face: in fine, he had extinguished all his liabilities, and bought&#xD;
.a house on Fifth avenue, where he lived in elegant style.&#xD;
Doubtless the general esteem which he had won by these acts&#xD;
of high integrity had procured him a responsible post in the&#xD;
city government, of which the salary was nominal, but the pick-&#xD;
ings amounted to a sum so large that it could not be classed as&#xD;
income. It was said that he had doubled his fortune by  as&#xD;
share in contracts, all legitimate operations. It was thought he&#xD;
would run for Congress: and if he did, the knowing ones ob-&#xD;
served that Varick would make a good thing of it. Enjoying&#xD;
the unlimited confidence of this admirable citizen and model&#xD;
public functionary, and dispensing his fortune with elegant&#xD;
liberality in their splendid and hosnit ble mansion, Mrs. Varick's&#xD;
social position was what in vulgar N w York parlance is te-md&#xD;
A. No. 1. It is a mistake, by the way, to suppose that in New&#xD;
York wealth is everything.  It is a great deal b    w&#xD;
blood and family connecti ns this branch of the Varicks with&#xD;
all their wealth, would have been sent to Coventry.&#xD;
Mrs. Varick is at uncle Dashon's to-night, and looking&#xD;
she always does, her best. In that principal irtue which our&#xD;
ladies sacrifice so much to obtain, viz: of dressing well, she&#xD;
shone conspicuous. Her robe was a pale purple satin withe&#xD;
train; her lovely arms were bare ; her berthe was of antique&#xD;
point lace, so old that it was yellow as gold, and she wore&#xD;

&#xD;
a profusion of tasteful jewelry. Mrs. Varick was fair, with&#xD;
light brown hair ; her mouth was her greatest defect, it resem-&#xD;
bled that of a!squirrel; her figure was universally admired, and&#xD;
by the way the superfluity of stuff in her train being borrowed&#xD;
from the body of the dress, showed what she herself considered&#xD;
her strongest attraction. She advanced to greet Rosemary with&#xD;
a sort of serpentine undulation, half turning to disengage her&#xD;
dress from some gentleman's boot, and kissed her on both&#xD;
cheeks, calling her " Cousin Rose." Augusta Varick did exact-&#xD;
ly as her mamma did, and then Master Cornelius Roosevelt&#xD;
Dashon Varick came shyly forward. This boy was a month or&#xD;
two older than Rosemary, with the most splendid eyes any male&#xD;
creature ever had : but he was undersized-and not quite straight.&#xD;
As the girl shook hands with him, she overtopped this boy cousin&#xD;
almost a head, and her capacious chest, well-poised figure and&#xD;
vigorous limbs (she was in shorts, remember), were a striking&#xD;
contrast to his narrow chest, stooping figure and poor shrivelled&#xD;
legs. Rose Marie bestowed on him a glance of surprised and.&#xD;
tender pity, and seemed about to kiss him; but the boy at that&#xD;
drew back with a flush of anger, and his mother too reddened&#xD;
deeper than her rouge. This incident was observed by all the&#xD;
company.&#xD;
Meanwhile the hour was past, and yet they waited for some&#xD;
one. Grandpapa consulted his watch. Then a carriage rolled&#xD;
up. Presently enters the loveliest woman of. the company.&#xD;
She was evidently a matron, for her husband was with her; to&#xD;
judge by the maturity of her form, might own thirty summers ;&#xD;
but her face, of an ideal purity in all its containing curves--&#xD;
perfect oval or classic profile,-was still of a delicate bloom; her&#xD;
throat (to which she was covered) and her arms were of a daz-&#xD;
zling whiteness, heightened by her black vlIvet robe. A dia-&#xD;
mond arrow pierced her braid, and a cross of brilliants glittered&#xD;
upon her breast. Grandmamma Dashon received her with&#xD;
distinction, and then immediately presented Rosemary, saying:&#xD;
--" My dear Mrs. Atherton, lit me present to you my grand-&#xD;
daughter, Miss Rose Marie Dashon."-And Mrs. Atherton, like&#xD;
Mrs. Varick, stooped down and kissed Rosemary on both cheeks&#xD;
-with a mouth like one of Correggio's smiling angels.&#xD;
&#xD;
*le&#xD;
&#xD;
"Your papa and I were great friends," she said.&#xD;
"YVarick and you must have danced together hundreds of&#xD;
times," said grandmamma.&#xD;
"Shall I ever forget it?  A handsome boy and a brave.&#xD;
How well I remember his quitting me once in the quadrille, to&#xD;
run out to a fire !"&#xD;
"This daughter of his is our only grandchild-do you under-&#xD;
stand ?" said grandmamma.&#xD;
"I understand perfectly," said Mrs. Atherton, smiling. "Poor&#xD;
thing ! I pity you, my dear. I was an only child and great&#xD;
heiress too. So in all your troubles you must come to me,-will&#xD;
you, Miss Rose Marie ?"-with a glance half mirthful, half ten-&#xD;
der, which fascinated Rosemary.&#xD;
Many others hastened to greet this beautiful woman whose&#xD;
appearance at-this family gathering was a mystery to some of&#xD;
the Varicks. The Athertons were very wealthy people who had&#xD;
been residing abroad fQr a number of years. A domestic inci-&#xD;
dent, requiring, as Mrs. Atherton fancied,'Dr. Varick's attention,&#xD;
had recalled them some months previous, since when they had&#xD;
been at their country seat. Within a few weeks only had they&#xD;
returned to town to spend the winter, but it was solely in order&#xD;
to carry on the education of their children to better advantage,&#xD;
and they seemed to avoid general society. Grandmamma&#xD;
Dashon could have told them why she invited the Athertons on&#xD;
the present occasion. Twelve years before, when Mrs. Atherton&#xD;
was a girl of eighteen, she had called upon Mrs. Dashon-the&#xD;
most fashionable matron of the time--with a singular request&#xD;
which Mrs. Dashon had haughtily refused. The young lady had&#xD;
expressed herself on the subject of the refusal with a great deal&#xD;
of warmth, and Mrs. Dashon had been seriously offended.&#xD;
There had been a coolness ever since between the families.&#xD;
"What do you know about such matters, Miss D.?-you an&#xD;
unmarried girl !" Mrs. Dashon had said,,contemptuously.&#xD;
"I know so much as this, Mrs. Dashon," answered the young&#xD;
lady with spirit, "that the mother who is so well prepared for&#xD;
an infant born two months before its time---"&#xD;
"How do you know that interesting fact? You have the other&#xD;

ma-de-moi-selle's word for it I suppose !"-with a short scornful&#xD;
.laugh.&#xD;
"The poor mother is unconscious, madam. I know 1 othing&#xD;
about such matters myself-I give you the opinion of the doc-&#xD;
tor and the other ladies. The little creature has neither nails&#xD;
nor eyelashes, and a quart mug would hold it, I think."&#xD;
" Ha ! ha! poor little fadnole ! It won't live, and so much the&#xD;
better."&#xD;
"It is your own flesh and blood, madam," replied Miss D.,&#xD;
indignantly, "for whom, I repeat to you, the lovely young&#xD;
mother has prepared a drawer-full of the most beautifully&#xD;
worked clothing--her needle is sticking in the baptismal robe !----&#xD;
I will stake my own character that she never did that for a child&#xD;
whose birth should cause her to blush."&#xD;
"So much the better for her, Miss D. She had better die,&#xD;
then, and go to Heaven at once, for into my house neither she&#xD;
nor her-child shall come."&#xD;
For Mrs. Atherton (then unmarried) was one of the ladies,&#xD;
visitors of a charitable society, who found poor Therese Roma-&#xD;
rin, or Dashon rather, delirious and expiring, on the second day&#xD;
after the birth of Rosemary. Miss D., as a girl moving in Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon's circle, and knowing the family from a child, was de-&#xD;
puted to communicate, the facts to that lady, and she did it with&#xD;
energy but without success.&#xD;
But, all these fine people now filed in to dinner, served in the&#xD;
oak dining-room. The gilded corona was lighted up and threw&#xD;
a flood of light upon the large round table. Every guest's&#xD;
name was in his plate. Rosemary found herself placed between&#xD;
her cousin Roosey, and a. gentleman to whom Mrs. Atherton&#xD;
immediately stad :-" Alban, I want to introduce you to your&#xD;
youthful neighbor."--The gentleman turned to her with a smile,&#xD;
and Mrs. Atherton introduced Mr. Atherton to Miss Dashon.&#xD;
"My Christian name is Rose Marie," said the young girl,&#xD;
pointedly.&#xD;
"They ought to call you Rosemary," said Mr. Atherton.&#xD;
"They do," said Rosemary.&#xD;
" Ah! I have made a happy guess. I foresee that we shall&#xD;
be great friends, Miss Rosemary."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I like you very much already," said the little girl, frankly.&#xD;
"lie is a sad flirt, Miss Rose," said Mrs. Atherton: "so I put&#xD;
you on your guard."&#xD;
"That lady is your wife, of course-is she not, sir ?" said&#xD;
Rosemary, in a girlish whisper.&#xD;
"Of course, and jealous !" in the same tone.&#xD;
Mr. Atherton got on famously with his young neighbor, who&#xD;
found her cousin rather surly. Between the succession of&#xD;
courses, and the attentions he was obliged. to pay to one of her&#xD;
aunts who sate on his right, he contrived to make the dinner&#xD;
very agreeable to her, When the dessert was come, he was ex-&#xD;
plaining to her a project he had of a great park for her to ride&#xD;
in, like the Bois de Boulogne at Paris; and Rosemary boldly&#xD;
referred it to grandpapa, who she thought could do anything&#xD;
that merely required money, and the topic waa hunted down by&#xD;
the whole table. Mr. Atherton became silent, but occasionally&#xD;
smiled with Rosemary at the elegant hubbub they had caused.&#xD;
At last he was appealed to by Mr. Dashon, who was in favor of&#xD;
setting on foot an immense subscription to buy land for a park.&#xD;
"It is useless to talk of subscriptions for a project that won't&#xD;
pay dividends," replied Atherton. "This sort of thing must&#xD;
be done by the sovereign."&#xD;
"The sovereign ' "&#xD;
"Yes, the People. Let the legislature authorize a popular&#xD;
vote on the question whether the city shall buy and lay out a&#xD;
great park. Then it will be done. All sovereigns are naturally&#xD;
munificent, and the people-sovereign above all."&#xD;
{ "You really think such a thing could be got through ?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Dashon.&#xD;
"I am certain of it. It is the only really popular idea I&#xD;
have heard of since the Croton was brought into the city."&#xD;
" Let us try," said grandpapa Dashon.&#xD;
"What we want to subscribe for," said Alban, "is the expense&#xD;
of lobbying and engineering the bill through the assembly."&#xD;
" Our legislators," observed Mr. Plaidoyer, "are of that&#xD;
incorruptible integrity that they won't permit the people to&#xD;
spend their own money unless they receive a considerable&#xD;
douceur themselves."&#xD;

"The Cerberus of the treasury must ne drugged with golden&#xD;
honey," said Dr. Clerestory.&#xD;
'cGolden honey ! That is money ! Good, good !" chuckled Dr.&#xD;
Varick.&#xD;
"Golden honey ! That is money ! Why, I declare, uncle,&#xD;
you are quite a poet !" said Mrs. George Varick ; and Dr.&#xD;
Edward blushed all round his spectacles at his own achieve-&#xD;
ment, which passed from mouth to mouth of all the Varicks at&#xD;
table.&#xD;
"Mr. Dashon and myself can well afford to pay a few thou-&#xD;
sands each to further such a project," continued Atherton, "for&#xD;
we shall get it back fifty times over in the enhanced value of&#xD;
our property. As the land on the island is limited, the more of&#xD;
it is taken up by a park, the less is left for other purposes, Sand&#xD;
what is left must rise in price."&#xD;
"Won't you lose in taxation what you gain in that way ?"&#xD;
asked Dr. Mannikin.&#xD;
"Certainly not, doctor," said Atherton, smiling. "The taxes&#xD;
are paid by our tenants, and by the public that enjoys the park ;&#xD;
the rise in real estate goes into our pockets."&#xD;
"I will subscribe five thousand on the spot to set the thing&#xD;
going," said grandpapa Dashon.&#xD;
After the ladies had retired a subscription was started. The&#xD;
Varicks did not come down so liberally as Atherton considered&#xD;
that they ought, still in that wealthy company twelve thousand&#xD;
dollars was soon made up and Mr. Dashon was confident that&#xD;
it could be raised to fifty thousand, if necessary, in the course of&#xD;
an hour down town. Every man's word was as good as his&#xD;
bond, and Atherton being a lawyer as well as a man of fortune,&#xD;
was authorized to manage the affair.&#xD;
-" If it cost twice fifty thousand I shall put it through," said&#xD;
he, as he placed the subscription paper in his pocket. It was&#xD;
concluded by pledging mutual secrecy.&#xD;
--" To succeed," said Atherton, astutely, "we must renounce&#xD;
the credit of succeeding. Let every influential paper in the&#xD;
city privately know our determination, and then take to itself&#xD;
the merit of the initiative."&#xD;
'd The parties who never by any possibility initiate anything&#xD;
&#xD;
and who seem to initiate everything," said Dr. Mannikin,&#xD;
sardonically.&#xD;
"'Tis the cheapest way of securing their support," observed&#xD;
Dr. Clerestory.       .&#xD;
"Aye! the papers lead public opinion, but what leads the&#xD;
papers ?" demanded Mr. Dashon. "This !"-holding up his&#xD;
purse.&#xD;
"The power behind the throne in this country is money," said&#xD;
tr. Mannikin.&#xD;
"Golden honey," said Dr. Clerestory, with a dry smile.&#xD;
"Golden honey, that is money !" echoed Dr. Varick with a&#xD;
self-congratulatory chuckle.&#xD;
"Money plus brains," said Atherton, with an audacious look.&#xD;
"What can a rich fool do, like poor George Law for instance ?&#xD;
Even less than a poor genius. But money with intellect can do&#xD;
everything."&#xD;
"Both which you all have," said Dr. Mannikin, bowing to the&#xD;
rest of the company.&#xD;
"And you, doctor," said Atherton, twisting up a cigarette,&#xD;
"have one, and intend making use of it to obtain the other."&#xD;
Meanwhile in the " winter drawing-room" over their heads,&#xD;
Mrs. Atherton, with the easy manners of a reigning beauty, had&#xD;
taken the hand of the young Rosemary, while the other ladies&#xD;
gossipped about their families and the winter fashions, and seat-&#xD;
ing herself on the piano-stool, letting her rich drapery spread&#xD;
around her, prattled away in the pleasantest maniser with the&#xD;
little heiress She knew that Rosemary's mother was French.&#xD;
"So was mine, my dear," said the heart-enslaver, and Rose-&#xD;
mary, delighted, drew so near that Mrs.,Atherton began to play&#xD;
with her, curls.-" And Romarin-why that means rosemary in&#xD;
French, does it not?"  "But-certainly !" replied the little&#xD;
girl.--" And that is why your grandpapa used to call you Rose-&#xD;
mary-is it ?"-" Yes, certainly."-" I have seen you before,&#xD;
Rosemary-when you were very little indeed,"-.said the beauti-&#xD;
ful matron, tenderly; -and the little girl, emboldened, fairly took&#xD;

come to see me," said Mrs. Atherton.-" Where do you live '"'&#xD;
asks Rosemary.-" On the corner of -- street and the Ave-&#xD;
nue."-" Is that Mr. De Groot's house V'-" The same."-" Oh, I&#xD;
know it-there are two little girls live there !"-" They are my&#xD;
little girls, Rosemary. The two eldest are girls, but the baby is&#xD;
a boy."-" How old is the baby, Mrs. Atherton ?" inquired&#xD;
Rosemary.-" Six months only, and by the same token the&#xD;
little fellow expects me home soon."-" Ah ! he is so little as&#xD;
that !" said Rosemary. As the gentlemen entered Rosemary&#xD;
was jnst kissing Mrs. Atherton, who hushed her and turned&#xD;
round to the piano ; but as she began to play, the enchantress&#xD;
turned again her lovely spirited profile to Rosemary, with a&#xD;
roguish smile, as much as to say : "They nearly caught us-&#xD;
didn't they ?'"-And the young French girl, with instinctive&#xD;
coquetry, interpreted the movement and the smile by looking&#xD;
slyly across the instrument at those messiewrs, as if she had&#xD;
said :-' You have seen nothing, gentlemen, have you ?"&#xD;
It is no part of our plan to describe the pleasures of t} is even-&#xD;
ing further than their bearing on the story requires. It is easy&#xD;
to give a fictitious character any amount of accomplishment,&#xD;
ap$ it would prove nothing if we said that Mrs. Atherton&#xD;
was a remarkable vocalist: we have said it already when we&#xD;
were relating long ago her personal history, and the years that&#xD;
have since elapsed have only ripened her powers. She knew&#xD;
that everybody would wish her to sing, and gave a delicate re-&#xD;
cognition of the strictly domestic character of the reunion to&#xD;
which she had been invited, by not waiting to bey asked. All&#xD;
conversation was hushed while she poured out her, soul-like&#xD;
melody. The beauty of the singer .enhanced the charm. The&#xD;
gentleman. listened spell-bound. When it was over, she rose&#xD;
quickly from the instrument, laughed slightly at the wondering&#xD;
Rosemary, patting her kindly on the cheek, and went to a&#xD;
seat where she was surrounded by congratulations -and praises,&#xD;
which she acknowledged- eafelessly. The ladies, among whom&#xD;
Mrs. George Varick was conspicuous, complimented her husband.&#xD;
"Mrs. Atherton has continued to cultivate her voice in obe-&#xD;
dience to me," answered he, smiling : "hence I am fairly&#xD;
entitled'to the praise."&#xD;
&#xD;
NEW AND OLD CIIARACTIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"A woman would do a great deal for such a husband," said&#xD;
Mrs. Varick.&#xD;
The rules required that the young lady on whose account&#xD;
this reunion took place should give a specimen of her accom-&#xD;
plishments also, if she possessed any. Grandmamma Dashon&#xD;
understood these points very well. She had discovered that this&#xD;
little girl was for her age extremely well educated, and she was&#xD;
resolved that the Varicks should know it. First a portfolio of_&#xD;
her drawings was handed about. All admitted that for a child&#xD;
they were clever. The maps in India ink were voted beautiful&#xD;
and indicated also a knowledge of geography.&#xD;
"Carefully and neatly executed--I wish my little girls may&#xD;
be able to do as well," said Mr. Atherton.&#xD;
"My grand papa taught me !" said the little girl, eagerly&#xD;
"that is"--glancing round-" my grandpapa Romarin."&#xD;
Presently, Rosemary stood up in the middle of the saloon, and&#xD;
a little hush being made, recited a passage from Racine. It&#xD;
was thoroughly child-like and thoroughly French ; everybody&#xD;
was amused, and the purity of her accent and pretty gestures&#xD;
received high commendation. And now she must seat herself&#xD;
a-t the piano and play ; then sing a short German song, then an&#xD;
Italian one. All this was entirely satisfactory, and showed that&#xD;
no girl of twelve could have employed her time to more purpose.&#xD;
"You have a talent for music, Rose," said Mrs. Atherton,&#xD;
"and if you practise you will in time play far better than I ever&#xD;
shall ;-but you should not sing much."&#xD;
"Her voice lacks pathos," said Mr. Atherton: "it should be&#xD;
allowed to rest."&#xD;
"She takes to this kind of exhibition of herself very natu-&#xD;
rally, we must allow," said Mrs. George Varick, shrugging her&#xD;
white shoulders.&#xD;
But what is this that the tall servant brings in '? An artist's&#xD;
easel, and a black-board with a great diagram chalked on it.&#xD;
At that Rosemary blushed, and exclaimed--." Grandmamma!"&#xD;
"My dear child," said grandmamma, "I want you to demon-&#xD;
strate--the what do you call it'?"&#xD;
"The square of he hypothenuse," said the child. " Every-&#xD;
body will laugh at me."&#xD;

NEW AND OLD CHARACTERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
With some difficulty she could be induced to comply. Then&#xD;
with a wilful grace she took grandpapa's cane as a pointer, and&#xD;
blushing deeply, demonstrated the 47th Proposition. Then&#xD;
grandmamma gave Mr. Atherton her algebra and requested him&#xD;
to examine her at hap hazard. The tall servant turned and&#xD;
lowered the black-board, and the young lady soon covered that&#xD;
side with mystical characters which except Atherton and Dr.&#xD;
Clerestory perhaps no one present understood. The solution was&#xD;
pronounced by both these gentlemen to be correct, and the others&#xD;
took it in faith.&#xD;
"This," said Atherton, emphatically, "is really remarkable.&#xD;
It is a study of Freshman year at Yale and Columbia-I had&#xD;
done it myself at fourteen, and was thought a forward boy.&#xD;
Did your grandpapa Romarin teach you algebra, petite 7"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly," said Rosemary.&#xD;
This exhibition was regarded with profound but well disguised&#xD;
irritation and contempt by several of those invited to witness it.&#xD;
Mrs. George Varick, who was generally considered to be chiefly&#xD;
interested in the matter, the more her young cousin s accom-&#xD;
plishments and talents became evident, the deeper and deadlier&#xD;
hate she conceived for her, modified only by a plan which&#xD;
before this party she had faintly outlined. After conversing with&#xD;
Mr. Atherton for along time, and so confidentially that it had the&#xD;
air of a flirtation, Mrs. George gliding through the apartment&#xD;
and speaking to several relatives in high praise of the youthful&#xD;
Dashon,-" Very generous on.your part !" as they said,-at last,&#xD;
as if by accident, stopped near Dr. Mannikin, who was listening,&#xD;
quite rapt, to another song from Mrs. Atherton. Dr.,fannikin&#xD;
rose and made her a slight but formal and respectful inclina-&#xD;
tion, as a professional man does to a great lady in society, with&#xD;
whom he wishes to stand well. They seemed to discuss the&#xD;
singer or the performance.&#xD;
"The petite Romarin is quite a success," whispered the&#xD;
doctor-.&#xD;
"If I were Louis Napoleon I would make the grandpapa a&#xD;
general-he has shown that he understands taking fortresses,"&#xD;
said Mrs. George, looking at the songstress as if about to cry&#xD;
Brava !&#xD;
&#xD;
" She will inherit these palatial halls, madam," replied the&#xD;
doctor sententiously.&#xD;
"Could she be persuaded to marry Roosey-do you think?"&#xD;
"Not for some years, I fancy."&#xD;
" Roosey will be a man as soon as she will a woman."&#xD;
"In feelings," said the doctor, emphatically.&#xD;
"In person he will be a wretched little dwarf, I know," hissed&#xD;
the lady. " For all that she must marry him or--"&#xD;
"There is time for a thousand things to happen before that."&#xD;
"True-and what is your boasted science worth, Ezekiel"--&#xD;
turning to him-" if you can't rid me of such vermin as that ?"&#xD;
"An imprudent remark," said the doctor, glancing round&#xD;
uneasily.&#xD;
"If I meant anything by it," said the lady, carelessly and re-&#xD;
suming her composed manner. "As I don't, where's the im-&#xD;
prudence ?"&#xD;
When the Athertons retired, which was very soon, Mrs. Ather-&#xD;
ton pleading, with a brilliant smile, her domestic cares, grand-&#xD;
papa Dashon said :-" That is the happiest couple in New&#xD;
York."&#xD;
"Mrs. Atherton retains her beauty perfectly," said grand-&#xD;
mamma. ' What a mouth she has! Of all things I admire a&#xD;
beautiful mouth-do you understand ? No face can be really&#xD;
beautiful when the mouth is mean, or like an animal, do you&#xD;
understand ?"&#xD;
Now it was Mrs. Dashon who first observed in regard td her&#xD;
niece, how much "Bell's mouth resembled a squirrel's"-a re-&#xD;
mark which did not fail in time to reach that young lady's ears,&#xD;
and supplied one of the many original reasons why Mrs. George&#xD;
Varick hated her aunt, who on her part returned the sentiment&#xD;
with the most Christian and lady-like aversion.&#xD;
Drs. Varick and Mannikin also discovered that they had pro-&#xD;
fessional calls to attend and disappeared : and the younger por-&#xD;
tion of the company, reinforced by the juniors from several&#xD;
neighboring families, organized a quadrille in the great drawing-&#xD;
room. Rosemary was made to play the hostess to them all,&#xD;
New as the part must have been to her, she did it charmingly,&#xD;

If poor little Roosey were only two years older, instead of two&#xD;
months, and a head taller-yes, a head taller-his mother might&#xD;
have some hope of him too."&#xD;
But Rose will never take to that boy except in a sisterly&#xD;
way. She is dancing now with a lad full fifteen, and although&#xD;
he has the downy beginnings of a mustache, smokes and swears&#xD;
and drinks brandy and water, and goes to the theatre two or&#xD;
three nights in the week, she will presently toss back her black&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
HOW THE DASHONS EDUCATED ROSEMARY.&#xD;
MRs. ATHERTON entertained her husband that evening with&#xD;
the history of little Rosemary Dashon, which he had never&#xD;
before heard. Seated in her low rocker, with her own baby in&#xD;
her arms, Mary Atherton was happy within and spicy without.&#xD;
There was no vinegar in her sparkling narrative, still less any&#xD;
gall, but plenty of pepper and salt. She didn't spare grand-&#xD;
mamma Dashon nor the Varicks either. By her account tho&#xD;
story of Therese Romarin, the mother of Rosemary, was a&#xD;
deeply pathetic one, and grandmamma Dashon either knew no-&#xD;
thing about it, or did not relate it correctly. Mrs. Atherton&#xD;
remembered perfectly the sensation caused by Mile. Romarin's&#xD;
elopement, and also the emotion-so very rare a thing-at early&#xD;
Mass on the first Sunday of the month immediately following,&#xD;
on seeing her go to communion as usual, and how as she came&#xD;
back from the altar, with head inclined and hands meekly&#xD;
folded according. to her custom, every one saw the wedding-&#xD;
ring on her finger-she who never wore rings at any time..&#xD;
Nobody doubted she was married, she never denied it, she an-&#xD;
swered unhesitatingly, though with a blush, when addressed as&#xD;
"Mrs. Dashon," and everybody understood the reason why they&#xD;
did nothing to force the fact on the attention of Varick Dashon's&#xD;
parents, and also why they ran away-it was not to implicate&#xD;
her father. They were not married till she left her father's&#xD;
house with Varick ; the contrary supposition was entirely false.&#xD;
Indeed there was nothing mysterious about it to Mrs. Atherton&#xD;
except the one undoubted fact that Mlle. Romarin deemed her-&#xD;
self acting right all the time, and that her director justified her.&#xD;
That was plain: -.tr on the morning of her marriage (Mrs.&#xD;
Atherton was knowing to all these circumstances) they met in&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6853-00000108"/>&#xD;
212&#xD;
&#xD;
ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
the sacristy, Mlle. Romarin was accompanied by her bonne,&#xD;
Dick Dashon by one of his own family-a young lady-Mrs.&#xD;
Atherton for reasons of her own did not name her; and the&#xD;
bishop married them in the church, without other witnesses&#xD;
(for Mass was said then on week-days in the basement of the&#xD;
chapel) except the boy who lighted the candles on the altar&#xD;
and held the vessel of holy water to sprinkle the ring withal.&#xD;
At that time no record was kept of marriages, not even a certi-&#xD;
ficate was given, but it was on a certain morning of June, 1830,&#xD;
as " Monseigneur certified afterwards in writing to Capt Ro-&#xD;
marin."&#xD;
"Why did he not publish it ?" asked Atherton.&#xD;
Because, unfortunately, owing to a sad mischance, the proof&#xD;
of this marriage at this date, did not clear up the real charge&#xD;
under which his daughter suffered, that Monseigneur married&#xD;
them to repair a fault already committed. For on the last night&#xD;
of the same year, while her husband was absent at the seat of&#xD;
government soliciting a clerkship, returning, from church about&#xD;
dusk (for the next day was Sunday as well as New Year's Day),-&#xD;
she slipped and fell, receiving a severe shock, and before the&#xD;
New Year's morning dawned gave birth to a daughter, to save&#xD;
whose life she sacrificed her own. For after this afflicting acci-&#xD;
dent, it is certain that Therese Dashon, nee Romarin, descendant&#xD;
by her mother of the princely Floreals, destitute of all attend-&#xD;
ance, after doing all for the child untimely born that she knew&#xD;
how, seeing that contrary to all her expectation it lived and&#xD;
cried, dressed herself and went forth before daylight in the&#xD;
bleak winter morning for a physician. She went first to Dr.&#xD;
Varick, and the doctor declined going to a tenement house at&#xD;
that hour, still more decidedly when he heard that it was Varick&#xD;
Dashon's child-he " did not want to have anything to do with&#xD;
the case."-A few doors further, wandering up Broadway, the&#xD;
fainting mother found another doctor ; despairing she pulled&#xD;
the night-bell-&#xD;
"It was our good Dr. Tankerville," continued Mary Ather-&#xD;
ton.  "You may guess what his answer was.     He conveyed&#xD;
Th6rbse home in his own carriage, carried her up stairs himself,&#xD;
saved the infant by his skilful care, but he could not save the&#xD;

mother; what terrible sequel of her heroic exposure I know&#xD;
not, destroyed her. Not knowing who she was, he sent for our&#xD;
ladies; some of us came--why linger over so sad a tale? Never&#xD;
shall I forget how poor Capt. Romarin looked when he entered&#xD;
the room-his white stern soldier-like face! Nobody knew&#xD;
what to say, but I drew aside the curtain of a little crib--I had&#xD;
bought it myself-and showed him the infant wrapped in cotton.&#xD;
lie regarded it with his eagle eye.--' How long before its time&#xD;
was this child born, doctor?' he asked, hoarsely and briefly.-..&#xD;
'To judge by its appearance a six months' child,' said the doc-&#xD;
tor, in the most matter-of-fact tone--'it is barely viable-I&#xD;
never knew one live yet!'-' It MUST live!' cried Romarin, burst-&#xD;
ing into a flood of tears.-Oh, Alban! there was not a dry eye&#xD;
among us all !"&#xD;
Now here was an instance of what we may almost call those&#xD;
secret machinations of Providence which startle us so in unfold-&#xD;
ing any history whatever.&#xD;
"The little chit has life enough in her now," observed her&#xD;
husband.&#xD;
SIsn't she a charming little gipsy ! So French ! And her&#xD;
progress in mathematics is astonishing to me."&#xD;
"A clever little girl and well taught."&#xD;
"And such a pity that all should run to waste under Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon's finishing hand," resumed his wife. "Would you be-&#xD;
lieve that the talk ofsed'                      youe&#xD;
day-echoot theyta f isendng her to Psyche de Juponville's&#xD;
day-school, to be finished? The pupils, you know, wear only&#xD;
silk dresses, and practice their lessons beforeua swing-glass."&#xD;
"What lessons ?"&#xD;
"How to lift your robe in crossing a street, how in entering a&#xD;
carriage, and all the other coquetries of the sidewalk and the&#xD;
drawing-room, which a Christian maid or matron is all the love-&#xD;
lier for not comprehending. You look incredulous but it is&#xD;
fact. Psyche de Juponville's finished pupils have taken th&#xD;
avenue society by storm lately, but that little Rose Dashon has&#xD;
more in her head now that's worth knowing, than the best of&#xD;
them."&#xD;
''You appear to think highly of mathematics for girls, my&#xD;
dear."&#xD;

&#xD;
" Oh! it is not that, but solid studies. Have I not heard you&#xD;
often say that mathematics discipline the mind better than al..&#xD;
most any other branch."&#xD;
"Plato thought so, and recommended them for women. So&#xD;
he did gymnastics, in which respect his judgment'has not been&#xD;
so highly approved."&#xD;
"Why not ?" asked his wife, simply. "I thought exercise&#xD;
was as good for women as for men."&#xD;
"True, my dear ; but the gymnastics of the Greeks (as the&#xD;
name implies) were exercises in which men contended quite&#xD;
nude."&#xD;
" Ah !"-laughing innocently-" but surely that feature is not&#xD;
essential. And do you know, little Rosemary Dashon says she&#xD;
can climb 'as good as any boy V  I quite believe it, fdr she has&#xD;
the most supple, elastic figure in the world. . Her spine bends&#xD;
and springs back under your hand like a bow of steel."&#xD;
"I noticed her striding over Madam Dashon's grand carpet&#xD;
as if it had been a moonlit lawn," said her husband.&#xD;
"What a contrast to that poor little Cornelius Varick !" pur-&#xD;
sued Mrs. Atherton. "And yet, do you know, the Varicks&#xD;
think those two children should be married when they are old&#xD;
enough ?"&#xD;
"Cousins! and the boy a ricketty dwarf!"&#xD;
"Just what Mrs. Dr. Varick observed in telling'me of it: for&#xD;
she wants the child for her own son the lieutenant."&#xD;
"Twice her age."&#xD;
"That objection will diminish as they grow older."&#xD;
"It will be some years before any such plans can take effect,"&#xD;
observed Atherton, drily.&#xD;
" True ; and do you know that I have formed a plan, dear,&#xD;
for this little Rosemary ?"&#xD;
"Matrimonial? you don't mean her for Eugene, I hope."&#xD;
"Scarcely," said his wife, laughing-for Eugene was her&#xD;
baby ;-" no, an educational plan; that is, to have her join our&#xD;
girls in their school-room. Now I know what you are going to&#xD;
object-that she is three years older than Grace, and so ad-&#xD;
vanced that they can have no lessons in common. As regards&#xD;
English studies, I am not so sure of that."&#xD;
&#xD;
HO    THE DASHONS EDUCATED ROSEMARY.         215&#xD;
"I am sure of the contrary," said Atherton. "Grace would&#xD;
correct her English a dozen times in as many sentences."&#xD;
"There, then, you see the advantage to the child, and it will&#xD;
be equally good for the French of my girls."&#xD;
"We will grant that."&#xD;
"Well, then I would look after the faith and morals of this&#xD;
little orphan, in whom I must feel the tenderest interest."&#xD;
"My love, you reflect somewhat severely on Mrs. Dashon in&#xD;
that remark !"&#xD;
" Mrs. Dashon ! ! You should have heard her talk to me to-&#xD;
night about her grandchild's religious education. She considers&#xD;
her destined to make some grand alliance in France-the child&#xD;
is descended from the Flor6als, you know-and that is another&#xD;
claim upon me, for the Flordals and the Rosieres were always&#xD;
connected :-so graudmamma wishes her to be trained in all&#xD;
the observances of the Catholic religion-' were she herself a&#xD;
duchesse, she would attend Mass in state every Sunday'-' what&#xD;
one believes is quite another affair, do you understand ''-Hence,&#xD;
she has taken a pew at St. Vincent's for the child, and sends her&#xD;
in the carriage with her bonne every Sunday morning !"&#xD;
Is it a thoroughly good little girl-this Rosemary ?"&#xD;
"She has had no one to teach her what is right but an old&#xD;
officer and a simple bonne. It seems that Capt. Romarin made&#xD;
a scientific division of the subject. He said to Louise-' You&#xD;
shall teach my grandchild her religion and her modesty-I will&#xD;
instruct her in all other moral virtues.'-I judge that the plan&#xD;
has succeeded-at least she is open as the day."&#xD;
"It is not from grandpapas and bonnes that children learn&#xD;
mischief. What companions of hei own age has she had ?"&#xD;
"Till lately none ; and even now she has no intimate friends."&#xD;
"Except her goat."&#xD;
"Then she is so devotedly attached to her grandpapa Roma-&#xD;
rin, who brought her up, understands so well the difference&#xD;
between her obligations to him and to these rich worldly&#xD;
grandparents who will make her their heir. It is a shrewd,&#xD;
sensible little damsel withal."&#xD;
"The Dashons would not object, I suppose."&#xD;
"They would jump at the chance !" said Mary Atherton.&#xD;

"See a little mom of her before you decide," said her hus-&#xD;
band.   If our maternal instinct is satisfied, I shall not object&#xD;
on general principles."Ahr&#xD;
Tonhenext day Rosemary came by invitation to visit the Ather-&#xD;
tons She brought Nanette, and the children were so much .&#xD;
delighted with both playmates, their plays which, began to be&#xD;
somewhat dull had so much more life than usual, that Mrs.&#xD;
Atherton was quite convinced her plan was good. They kept the&#xD;
child to dinner; in the evening Mr. Atherton joined his family&#xD;
and amused the girls with funny games. It is in these unguard-&#xD;
ed moments that character shows itself. Rosemary, quite un-&#xD;
used to such diversions, grew wild with excitement. In the&#xD;
midst of it arrived a servant with a carriage to convey Miss&#xD;
Dashon home.   --bekn                                 f&#xD;
"Oh! I am so sorry !" said Rosemary, instantly breaking off,&#xD;
with a look of severe disappointment.&#xD;
"Oh, don't go yet-don't let her go, papa !" cried the Ather-&#xD;
ton girls.                                     qatro&#xD;
"I think we may venture to keep the carriage a quarter of&#xD;
an hour, till we have finished this game, Miss Rose," said Mr.&#xD;
Atherton.&#xD;
"I thank you very much, Mr. Atherton," replied the young&#xD;
lady with dignity, "but my grandpapa says that in not obeying&#xD;
immediately, one disobeys." d&#xD;
With that she at once put on her beaver and mantle, embraced&#xD;
her little friends and Mrs. Atherton, offered her hand to Mr.&#xD;
4.therton, left a kiss for Eugene, and departed. We divine that&#xD;
the Athertons made their proposition immediately to the Dashons.&#xD;
The Dashons were charmed. The question of Rosemary's&#xD;
education, which had become embarrassing, obtained in this man-&#xD;
ner a prompt and easy solution. She was not seat to a board-&#xD;
ing-school, to which grandpapa Dashon was extremely averse;&#xD;
and yet grandmamma Dashon escaped the bore of superintending&#xD;
her instruction by masters. The pecuniary part was so arrann&#xD;
ed-hat Mr. Dashon incurred no obligation to the Atherons,&#xD;
while the governess and masters had every reason to be satisfied&#xD;
As soon as the holidays were over Rosemary commenced going&#xD;
regularly' every morning -at nine o'clock to Mrs. Atherto&#xD;

to school. The lessons lasted from nine to three, with an hour's&#xD;
intermission for play and luncheon. Thus six hours da&#xD;
cept on Thursdays and Sundays, were spent by our little heroil~e&#xD;
under the roof of her friends and chiefly under Mrs. Atherton's&#xD;
maternal eye. Tuese days scarcely formed an exception. The&#xD;
intimacy of school-hours led to engagenents for the weekly holi-&#xD;
day.Indeed at all times, if Rose was not at Mrs. Atherton's the&#xD;
arton girls were sure to be at " Rosemary's," as in children's&#xD;
parlance Mr. Dashon's mansion was soon called. They were&#xD;

them all. Bessie Atherton, a golden-haired blonde, was a child&#xD;
of infinite susceptibility and mobility of temper, an Apiil tem-&#xD;
perameit of smiles and tears, of eager affection and short-lived&#xD;
petulance ; but if she wept, it was like a little lady, with her&#xD;
cambric handkerchief on her face and her face buried in one&#xD;
graceful arm, haughtily suppressing her sobs ; if she smiled or&#xD;
laughed, the little aristocrat had the air of despising laighter&#xD;
all the same :-it was the most comical piece of infant noblesse-&#xD;
that you can conceive. Mary Grace-quiet, reserved, sometimes&#xD;
moody, dreamily indolent, yet capable of intense application,&#xD;
addicted to novel-reading, even in her temper, invincible in her&#xD;
vill, with a high opinion of herself, her parents, her family, her&#xD;
faith and everything else belonging to her, a deep clear brunette&#xD;
in complexion, with eyes like sloes and hair like her mother's,&#xD;
of a rich blackish brown-was not thought so loveable as Bessie,&#xD;
but was more constant, more persevering both in study and&#xD;
in attachments, and for four years kept abreast of Rosemary in&#xD;
English studies, though obliged to "knock under" to her in&#xD;
French, music and mathematics. In this competition of course&#xD;
little Bessie was nowhere.&#xD;
Mr. Atherton thought that Rose Dashon's turn for the exact&#xD;
sciences ought to be encouraged, and with grandpapa Dashon's&#xD;
consent, he got a rare mathematical scholar, actuary of a Life&#xD;
Insurance Company in which they both were interested, to&#xD;
superintend this part of her education. Mr. Charles Calcul&#xD;
turned up his nose at the idea of a girl being a mathematician;i;&#xD;
but after making Rosemary show him how to extract the mth&#xD;
root of a polynomial, he laughed, settled his auburn wig, pulled&#xD;
his large round English ear, and said in broad Yorkshire," Vall,&#xD;
we ken but troy her, Mister Atherton." Rosemary teased and&#xD;
provoked the poor mathematician out of his life almost, but she&#xD;
made great progress under him, with the more facility as all the&#xD;
books were in her native tongue.&#xD;
Each summer saw the Athertons flit to their rural mansion onf&#xD;
the Hudson, a quasi-baronial seat ; and grandpapa Dashof&#xD;
erected near them a pretty cottage after the designs of Down&#xD;
ing: for his own country-house was on the Sound. Here the&#xD;
lighter lessons were resumed, but the physical nature receive&#xD;

the chief care. Grandpapa paid an annual visit of at least two&#xD;
months to the Springs for his gout. Rose was then the guest&#xD;
of the Athertons. With all her affection and duty to her grand-&#xD;
parents, those were the golden days of her youth. So passed&#xD;
the years of these children of opulence. The second Spring&#xD;
Rose Dashon and Grace Atherton were confirmed together.&#xD;
The third summer Rose was found to  measure five feet exact,&#xD;
and lengthened her dresses to within tw  ches of her ancles&#xD;
But she still wore a brown "flat" on wee  ays and her hair in&#xD;
ringlets. Its color was a shade or two lig ter, and by pulling&#xD;
it out straight the jade could nearly sit on it. She would have&#xD;
confined it in a braid, as well as have had her skirts sweep the&#xD;
walks; had she been allowed her own way; for grandamma&#xD;
was terribly afraid of her growing up, and would not hear of&#xD;
either proposal, an obstinacy which cost the youIg lady many&#xD;
tears when the muslins were fitted. She even wrote to grand-&#xD;
papa Romarin on the subject, but as the dawning of the Empire&#xD;
was occupying his attention at the moment, and the Prince Pre-&#xD;
sident had just named him a general, although he answered his&#xD;
granddaughter's letter, he entirely forgot to say anything about&#xD;
her curls or dresses. To make her amends he sent her some&#xD;
pretty Parisian gifts.&#xD;
The third summer went like lightning, for that autumn was&#xD;
destined to bring sad changes. Mr. Atherton was in Congress.&#xD;
lie took a house in Washington, and his beautiful wife accom-&#xD;
panied him to sustain his influence by her social charm. The&#xD;
children of course went with their parents, and Rosemary's&#xD;
school was closed.  There was more weeping at grandpapa&#xD;
Dashon's the day the Athertons left for the capital of the&#xD;
Union than on the day grandpapa Romarin sailed. It was not&#xD;
such a wilful storm of petulant grief. Rosemary sat on grand-&#xD;
papa's knee, and laid her head on his shoulder and cried at&#xD;
least an hour.-." Come, that will do," said grandmamma-&#xD;
such a great girl as you, almost fifteen years old, should not be&#xD;
such a cry-baby-do you understand ?"--Rose stopped crying&#xD;
and after that went cheerfully about her lessons as usual. Her&#xD;
masters agreed that she never made such progress as that year;&#xD;
she Was so eager to improve that she was unwilling to intermit her&#xD;

lessons even in summer, and she came down to the city twice a&#xD;
week to recite :-it was only a two hours' ride on the cars. It&#xD;
was the lonesession and lasted far into the summer, and the&#xD;
Athertons returned just as the Dashons were going to the White&#xD;
Sulphur, and the families missed each other. The next winter&#xD;
it was the same thing over, and a good deal duller for Rose-&#xD;
mary, who had no companions, no resource but her music, books,&#xD;
an occasional evening at the opera and driving out with grand-&#xD;
mamma in the dreary streets. Grandpapa had gout very severely,&#xD;
and was attended by Dr. Mannikin. Rose became quite devout.&#xD;
Grandmamma was alarmed lest her health should suffer, or she&#xD;
should take it into her head to enter a convent. For the child&#xD;
went to church every morning before breakfast, and during&#xD;
Lent abstained from meat-which grandmamma Dashon called&#xD;
"fasting rigorously, do you understand 1"-three days in the&#xD;
week. Rose Marie Dashon was now full sixteen years of age,&#xD;
though she scarcely looked it. The winter dresses, indeed, had&#xD;
at last been lengthened to the full requirements of incipient&#xD;
young ladyhood, but the raven ringlets,-tinged in the long ex-&#xD;
tremities with chestnut reflections, still waved on the shoulders&#xD;
and fell below the waist. To say the truth, Miss Rosemary was&#xD;
no longer so anxious about braiding them up; her thin long face,&#xD;
large dark eyes and majesty of brow did not suit a braid ; only&#xD;
when half-hidden in flowing tresses could the spare but serene&#xD;
lines of future beauty be discerned. She was very school-&#xD;
girlish, too, in figure, and a trifle awkward in her long dresses.&#xD;
Satisfied with their length, she cared nothing for their amplitude,&#xD;
which together with a profound apathy on the subject of beaux,&#xD;
caused a repulsion between Rose Dashon and her young ac-&#xD;
quaintances. As for the boys-the young gentlemen, as they&#xD;
wished to be considered-she was more than indifferent, actually&#xD;
hostile. She laughed at their man-like ways, their premature&#xD;
small vices, their foppish attire, and their ceremonious greetings&#xD;
to herself and other girls of her age. When the latter stirred&#xD;
abroad, they walked decorously along, mincing their steps, and&#xD;
practising all the airs of grown women, especially if some lads&#xD;
from sixteen to eighteen chanced to be observing them. If Rose&#xD;
Dashon wanted to speak to any of her little favorites, or to&#xD;

answer the nod of some matron friend, she would start bonnet&#xD;
less, cross the street on a run very likely; if she walked out, it&#xD;
was with a rapid, free and elastic step, straightforward to her&#xD;
destiation. Nay, it was enough .to see her standing quietl&#xD;
among a circle of girls of her age, to feel that shew&#xD;
them but not of them. Older people were sensiblewas among&#xD;
charm in all that, which escaped her contemporaries. The school&#xD;
girls who laughed at Rose Dashon fcr her slim figure in contrast&#xD;
with their own apparent diameters, and pitied her for having&#xD;
beaux to talk about-." and she the richest heiress in New York&#xD;
too !"-never elicited that grave parental admiration and al&#xD;
tenderness with which men prematurely gray in the Wods&#xD;
battle paused to address the owner of that slender unstarched&#xD;
shape, that intelligent, unembarrassed, modest&#xD;
And Rose was entirely content to answer such a on tenance,&#xD;
about her grandparents, her friends Grace and Bessie Atheres&#xD;
her progress in mathematics, music and drawing, her ridesher&#xD;
new horse Arab, and how long she expected to coie  d er&#xD;
masters before she entered "society."n&#xD;
Among Rosemary's fastest friends and  greatest d&#xD;
this period was Professor gacr.Hewsatst      a n irers at&#xD;
thisperod  as PofesorCalcul. He was an intelligent scholar,&#xD;
who believed that the chief end of man was te sd sche&#xD;
exact sciences, a study which, he firmly maintained, formed the&#xD;
sole occupation and felicity of the blessed in Heaven. Rose&#xD;
used to laugh at this.ese&#xD;
"I like to master a difficult problem, like the fut-&#xD;
parabola, or the calculation of an eclipse" siunctions of a&#xD;
Rose at her examination covered the blackboard with series&#xD;
upon series of equations that nobody but Calcul r ees&#xD;
understand, but which he regarded with intense d pretended to&#xD;
like it best when it's over, though, and I hope for a more agree-&#xD;
able occupation of my eternity than reducing infinite paraboree&#xD;
to algebraic symbols, 4r calculating never-ending eclipses of&#xD;
planets perhaps not yet created," and Rose laughed erily.&#xD;
"Moy dear pupil," Calcul would answer, "you forget that&#xD;
scoience--and there is no scoience but mathtyou  eternal&#xD;
truth, and that even God himself has mysterious relations  .&#xD;

"Ah" said Rose, "when we see Him as lie is, there will be&#xD;
an end of calculations. He is most simple-UnitY itself. And&#xD;
n Him we shall see all things, you know; so that logarithms&#xD;
will be entirely useless in reducing the equations that perplex us&#xD;
now," and Rose laughed again; for this scientific language was&#xD;
as simple to her as how to dress a doll.&#xD;
Tshen Calcul growled, and sometimes pinched her ear with&#xD;
grim affection, for he dearly loved the child, his only pupil, as&#xD;
he averred, that ever understood him or mathematics either.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE ROSE BEFORE IT BLOOMED.&#xD;
GRANDMAMMA was right :-she dreamed of the cloister.&#xD;
Grand mamma was wrong :-there was no particular danger in&#xD;
such a dream. It by no means followed that the child had a&#xD;
true vocation that way : it was but the natural revery of a virgin&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
Rosemary was maturing like the slow spring of southern&#xD;
climes, which creeps on step by step, instead of passing, as&#xD;
in the north, by one leap from winter's nakedness to the luxuri-&#xD;
ance of summer. Her intelligence had ripened while her sensi-&#xD;
bility lay dormant; and the possession of knowledge beyond her&#xD;
sex and years, with the accompanying consciousness of intellec-&#xD;
tual superiority, united with a bodily vigor rare in these degen-&#xD;
erate days, to inspire that proud love of independence and dis:&#xD;
damn of the future yoke, which is undoubtedly the first impulse&#xD;
of incontaminate youth. If that impulse is rarely felt, it is&#xD;
because youth is seldom incontaminate.&#xD;
An education singularly happy in its freedom from corrupt&#xD;
influences, with plain moral instruction so much more wholesome&#xD;
than the exaggerated delicacy of our artificial life, had combined&#xD;
with the vigilant aid of heavenly powers to preserve the innocence&#xD;
of Rosemary. That beautiful instinct-woman's guardian monitor,&#xD;
girlhood's sweet-briery fence" and fragrant charm-no shadow&#xD;
of an evil thought wilfully indulged had ever rendered it less&#xD;
sensitive in the bosom of Rose Dashon. This being so, it is not&#xD;
strange that a young Catholic, accustomed from childhood to&#xD;
hear the praises of virginity, taught to invoke daily a Virgin&#xD;
without spot as the most glorious, the most tender and the most&#xD;
powerful of intercessors at the throne of Infinite Purity, should-&#xD;
when the idea of woman's destiny first dawned upon her intelli-&#xD;

&#xD;
gence-timidly but aspiringly turn her thoughts to this state so&#xD;
winning in natural beauty and hallowed by religion. Poetry as&#xD;
well as faith painted in glowing colors the happiness of the holy&#xD;
nun. The nun lived secluded from the world. Her life was&#xD;
passed in divine meditation and worship of her Divine Spouse.&#xD;
That was a Bridegroom for whom the purest maid in her inno-&#xD;
cence could sigh unashamed. To rest in a chaste and narrow&#xD;
cell, with no companion but the crucifix, to kneel daily in a&#xD;
retired and silent convent-chapel safe behind its lofty grille ; to&#xD;
move along the cloister walk, where clustering columns cast fre-&#xD;
quent shadows on the tesselated pavement. an( roses bloom in&#xD;
the fair open rectangle-of this Rosemary had heard from Mrs.&#xD;
Atherton in talking of other times and other lands, and many a&#xD;
fine picture in, her friend's collection had helped her fancy to&#xD;
vivify the recital. Such things Rose dreamed of as others dream&#xD;
of listening to lovers' vows in moonlit gardens. It was at least a&#xD;
more delicate and less dangerous revery.. She imagined that&#xD;
glorious chevelure-her luxuriant tresses--which now floated&#xD;
unprofaned by any scissors beneath her very girdle, falling on the&#xD;
marble floor of a convent chapel, an emblematic sacrifice of all&#xD;
she then would offer to Him. Thence her elear and rapid&#xD;
intellect, trained to trace all things to their conclusion, flew over&#xD;
the intervening years to the final scene, the nun's death-bed---&#xD;
that bed where at last the longing of the mystic spouse is turned&#xD;
to fruition, where the joy of others ends and hers begins, her true&#xD;
bride-bed, her nuptial couch of immortality. Could she stand in&#xD;
His presence a virgin soul, and after the resurrection, in a virgin&#xD;
body, what a crown of eternal glory would it be in the sight of&#xD;
the angels!, All her sex's pride, all her young ambition (for&#xD;
Rose was ambitious), all her native and untamed delicacy, took&#xD;
this shape, and she sighed for the white amaranthine wreath of&#xD;
the Virgins as other maidens sigh for the orange flowers and nup-&#xD;
tial veil.&#xD;
And yet there was one person of the opposite sex and of an&#xD;
age near her own, for whom Rosemary manifested something like&#xD;
a preference. This was her cousin Cornelius. He was doubly&#xD;
her cousin, and she certainly regarded him as at least very nearly&#xD;
a brother. Young Varick was a precocious-youth, as those who&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROSE BEFORE IT BLOOMED.             225&#xD;
have suffered from his malady often are. He had entered college at&#xD;
thirteen and stood first in his class. When Roosevelt (as he liked&#xD;
best to be called) took prize after prize over fifty others older than&#xD;
himself, the family of course rung with his renown. His consti-&#xD;
tution had become more vigorous as he grew older and gained&#xD;
his height, which was below the middle stature. His limbs&#xD;
grew stout, his frame became thick-set and muscular, the stoop&#xD;
disappeared ; a very large head would still have given him&#xD;
the appearance of a dwarf, had it not been for his peach-&#xD;
like complexion, grand blue eyes and soft brown hair, which were&#xD;
boyish traits. Perhaps to preserve this aspect of the case, he&#xD;
wore a turn-over collar and round jacket, long after every other&#xD;
fellow of his age had left them off.&#xD;
During the year after the Athertons went to Washington the&#xD;
cousins were thrown a great deal together. Roosevelt prepared&#xD;
his mathematical lessons at his uncle Dashon's, in order to be&#xD;
assisted occasionally by Rose. At least this was the ostensible&#xD;
motive, though grandmamma Dashdn, whose dislike of the mother&#xD;
extended to the son, assigned another, viz.: to make love to his&#xD;
cousin.&#xD;
"Cornelius," she would say (she always called him Come.&#xD;
lius),--" is clever, All the Varicks are clever. But then he is&#xD;
a dwarf. I don't wish to become the ancestress of a race of&#xD;
Tom Thumbs.-do you understand ?"--with her most scornful&#xD;
laugh. "And ie is only tvo months older than my grand-&#xD;
daughter, and her cousin to boot: cousins should never marry-..&#xD;
do you understand ?"&#xD;
"I have not the most distant idea of marrying Roosey, grand.&#xD;
mamma," would Rosemary reply, with a blush. "He, is only a&#xD;
boy, you know, grandmamma, and his being my cousin is a&#xD;
reason why I should love him."&#xD;
" Ah, he is only a boy !" replied grandmamma, sagely. Her&#xD;
hair was more silvery than six years ago, her wrinkles more nu.&#xD;
merous, and her wisdom proportionably greater. "He is more&#xD;
a man than you are a woman, child-.do you understand ?"&#xD;
Grandmanma had also an offensive way o( calling him "the&#xD;
general," in allusion to Gen. T. Thumb. Mrs. Isabel Varick too&#xD;

pitied and snubbed her son before his cousin, all which excited&#xD;
Rosemary's sympathies strongly in favor of Roosevelt.&#xD;
One evening (it was in February) Cornelius and Rosemary&#xD;
were sitting together in the blue drawing-room; each had a&#xD;
slate, and there was a volume of French astronomical calcula-&#xD;
tions between them. The problem, whatever it was, was diffi-&#xD;
cult, and the equations extremely intricate. Rose worked at it&#xD;
patiently. It was her lesson, not Roosevelt's, for at college they&#xD;
did not pretend to reach the high and bewildering regions of&#xD;
analysis whither the relentless Calcul had at last carried his&#xD;
pupil. Roosevelt, however, affected to be studying tho same&#xD;
problem-for it was not beyond his comprehension, though out&#xD;
of his familiar line of study. One could easily see that it was&#xD;
affectation, for ever and anon he would lay down his slate pencil&#xD;
and lean upon his hand, as if lost.in thought: he was really&#xD;
watching his companion, who had covered one whole side of her&#xD;
slate with algebraic symbols, and was busily going over them to&#xD;
detect, if possible, some error which had escaped her. The&#xD;
absence of that lynx-eyed grandmamma, whose jealous vigilance&#xD;
had been overcome by the temptation of a game of whist, was a&#xD;
grand opportunity for the boy to gaze at his fellow-student instead&#xD;
of confining his attention to his book and slate.&#xD;
Young Varickwas in his senior year at college, and lacked&#xD;
but a few months of graduation. This circumstance, and the&#xD;
consideration of his sixteenth birthday, some months ago passed,&#xD;
had induced him to adopt a manlier fashion in his apparel. A&#xD;
dandy collar and showy neck-tie, an easy-fitting, large-sleeved&#xD;
frock-coat, something between a shooting-jacket and a sack,&#xD;
with a waistcoat and trowsers of distinguished pattern, such as&#xD;
the fast yet discriminating youths of the time affected, formed&#xD;
his new attire. His soft brown hair had been submitted to the&#xD;
curling tongs. His fair cousin took no notice of the change, and&#xD;
herself was youthfully arrayed: that is, in_ a brighter silk than&#xD;
her seniors wore on ordinary occasions, and "low-necked and&#xD;
short-sleeved."  One large white arm was bent to support her&#xD;
thoughtful forehead ; the other rested on the table beside the&#xD;
slate, managing the slate-pencil with a hand like Hebe's own.&#xD;
A long narrow gold comb secured her black tresses behind and&#xD;

"I love you, Rose Dashon. That's the whole truth," pur-&#xD;
sued Cornelius, proudly.&#xD;
The girl gave him an open stare of mute astonishment.&#xD;
"Yes, young as I am-boy as you think me-I love you&#xD;
passionately !"&#xD;
The first movement of the young girl was to half rise as if&#xD;
about to run away, her second to laugh, though with embar-&#xD;
rassment and a vivid blush.&#xD;
"Oh, Roosey Varick ! what a ridiculous declaration ! You a&#xD;
boy at college, and I school-girl!"&#xD;
"A man at college, if you please !" said Roosevelt, indig-&#xD;
nantly. "In a few months I shall be. a graduate. And you&#xD;
don't go to school."&#xD;
"I have masters and lessons, which is the same thing !"&#xD;
"So has Louisa Varick, and yet she is engaged to be mar-&#xD;
ried."&#xD;
"How supremely inconsequent !_ Louisa is engaged to a&#xD;
gentleman settled in business, Roosevelt, and you are only six-&#xD;
teen years and some months old-you can't deny that ;-no&#xD;
older than I-you cant deny that either."&#xD;
"Yes-two months older."&#xD;
"Fine difference ! One month and twenty-nine days. I can&#xD;
tell you to the fraction of a minute presently"-taking her&#xD;
slate again, with an amusing air of defiance.&#xD;
"Oh, confound your mathematics !" cries Roosevelt. "I de--&#xD;
test your eternal slake-fuls of figures."&#xD;
"Youcan't do the problems-that's why,".retorted Rose.&#xD;
" We ain't talking of problems, but of love," said the boy.&#xD;
"Something you know still less about," answers the young&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
"It is you who know nothing about it," replies Roosevelt.&#xD;
"I declare I never met a girl of your age who was such a&#xD;
perfect simpleton in such matters as ybu are, and I will leave it&#xD;
to anybody."&#xD;
"Well, I don't wish to know any more than I do-that's ona&#xD;

more important to think of just now-Dieu merci ! and you,&#xD;
too, Roosey. You had better attend to your college lessons, and&#xD;

lose all your fine fortune, and that's why I wanted you to love&#xD;
me beforehand, if possible."&#xD;
"Will grandpapa give his money to you, Roosey, in case I&#xD;
refuse to marry you ?" asked Rosenary, smiling, but not without&#xD;
a certain curiosity and interest.&#xD;
"My mother says so positively-but remember that I tell it&#xD;
you in confidence :-honor bright, Rosy !"&#xD;
"You may make perfectly sure of the fortune, then, Roosey,'&#xD;
s'nswered the girl, with a laugh. "I won't tell any body either.'&#xD;
"You despise me, Rose Dashon, because I am not quite so tall&#xD;
as others !" said the youth, stifling a sob. "For all that-if&#xD;
you must know the truth-your father was engaged to my&#xD;
mother, and if he had kept his word, I should be your grand.&#xD;
papa's heir this minute."&#xD;
"I suppose your mother told you that too ?"&#xD;
"She did."&#xD;
"It is false that I despise you on account of your height or&#xD;
for any other reason, Roosey."&#xD;
"You act like it."&#xD;
"You are young enough to grow taller," said the girl, with a&#xD;
smile on her lip and a tear in her eye.&#xD;
"I am almost as tall now as Mr. Douglas, who, my father.&#xD;
thinks, will be President."&#xD;
"That's right, Roosey ! Perhaps you will be President-who&#xD;
knows?   The Emperor was quite short too-you know the&#xD;
army called him the 'little corporal,'" said Rose, laughing.&#xD;
"Why, then, are you so set against me, Rosemaiy ?  Tell me&#xD;
that."&#xD;
The young girl mused ; her great dark eyes fastened on him&#xD;
mysteriously ; her perfect brow knitted into a meditative inten-&#xD;
sity; she flung her long curls back over her shoulders with one&#xD;
hand ; she looked like a young queen.&#xD;
"Cornelius !" she said, solemnly.&#xD;
"Rosemary ?"&#xD;
"You have no right to know that I have ever thought of&#xD;
anything but my lessons, but perhaps if you think so, you won't&#xD;
be cured of this fancy so soon. Now, then, because I do love&#xD;
&#xD;
you as a brother, and wish you to be a brother to me always, I&#xD;
will tell you all my heart."&#xD;
"Rose !" said the boy, rising and coming a little nearer to her,&#xD;
you're a trump, I vow."&#xD;
"I have thought about marriage a great deal," pursued the&#xD;
girl, with. a bigltt blush. "How could I help it, Roosey'&#xD;
Grandmamma often speaks to me of it, so does Louise, and&#xD;
sometimes even Mrs. Atherton used. Then aunt Varick wants&#xD;
me to marry her son, our cousin, who is already a commander&#xD;
in the navy, you know, and a MAN, loosey; ann your mother---&#xD;
that's no secret to me either-has set her heart on getting me or&#xD;
my fortune for you one of these days. Now Roosevelt, don't be&#xD;
pained by what I shall say. Nothing will induce me to marry any&#xD;
cousin, or any one named Varick, or Dashon, or both. Least of&#xD;
all will I ever marry you, Cornelius. If your mother expects it&#xD;
she is mistaken. In one word, I have been brought up from&#xD;
infancy to believe that the Varicks killed and defamed my&#xD;
mother ; your mother had a principal hand in it; I don't say that&#xD;
any of them meant it, Roosey; I forgive them all; but as for&#xD;
marrying one of their sons--as for calling one of them MOTHER !"&#xD;
--she sprang to her feet and confronted the lad with a flashing eye&#xD;
-her fairy foot fairly stamped with the determination that her&#xD;
whole figure breathed-" I WILL DIE FIRsT !"&#xD;
As we have already mentioned in a former chapter, the mantel-&#xD;
apiece of this roon was Opposite a window that looked on the&#xD;
avenue. In the day-time a person seated .at the table in the&#xD;
centre of the apartment, by glancing in the huge mirror that&#xD;

ohuse opposite reflected with its beautiful stone columns and&#xD;

&#xD;
way no other than the mother of Roosey and the cousin of&#xD;
Rosemary, Mrs. George Varick.&#xD;
Before Roosevelt Varick could reply to Rosemary's startling&#xD;
declaration, the front door-bell rang decisively. This by no&#xD;
means indicated, as it would indicate in England, a servant or a&#xD;
parcel; for knockers are not used in Ameiica; they went out&#xD;
with other colonial customs when the old gentry gave way to our&#xD;
spick and span bran-new aristocracy, which lives in brown-stone&#xD;
houses and has bells to its doors. Consequently, in a minute's&#xD;
time some one was admitted, a deep voice was heard inquiring,&#xD;
another minute passed while the visitor was doubtless laying&#xD;
aside his overcoat, the door of the drawing-room was thrown&#xD;
open and Mr. Atherton entered. Rosemary, who (school-girl-&#xD;
like) had resumed her seat at the table and drawn her book&#xD;
and slate towards her, sprang up joyfully.&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Atherton! How glad I am to see you !-when did&#xD;
you leave Washington ?-how is your wife 1-Where are Grace&#xD;
and Bessie ?"-These questions were mingled with about as many&#xD;
kisses, given and returned, in the French manner, the young&#xD;
lady offering first one, then the other cheek.-" My cousin&#xD;
Roosevelt Varick-you remember --Grandpapa and grand.-&#xD;
mamma are both out at a little whist party-I will send for&#xD;
them."&#xD;
A certain gravity with which men of mature years are apt to&#xD;
meet young persons whom they have known as children, disap-&#xD;
peared from Mr, Atherton's countenance before the sunshine of&#xD;
this cordial welcome. He took the chair she offered-her own&#xD;
-while Rosemary drew another and lighter one beside it, and&#xD;
placed her hand confidentially on its carved elbow. He had a&#xD;
little note for her from Grace, which she took eagerly, begged&#xD;
permission, broke open and read. The short session would soon&#xD;
be over, and they were all coming to New York immediately.&#xD;
Possibly papa might be recalled by an odious extra-session, and&#xD;
be kept in Washington till August.&#xD;
"Oh, how tiresome !" says Rosemary. "If I were you, sir, I&#xD;
would resign my seat, unless the people would make me em-&#xD;
peror, and then I would change the seat of government to New&#xD;
York. Washington is quite a ridiculous place, I think. Is it so&#xD;

"We don't have prizes senior year," said young Varick,&#xD;
stiffly.&#xD;
"Well, I never was at Columbia, you know. You have no&#xD;
more honors, then, to hope for till commencement ? Will you&#xD;
take the first salutatory, Varick ?"'&#xD;
"I shouldn't like to say so. There is more than one man&#xD;
who thinks his chance as good as mine."&#xD;
"You ought to beat tnem all to nothing in mathematics,"&#xD;
said Mr. Atherton, smiling and glancing at Rosemary."&#xD;
Mathematics don't count so high as classics with us," said&#xD;
Varick, thawing before Mr. Atherton's interest in his collego&#xD;
ambition.            t.&#xD;
"Professor A-    gives the tone, I suppose."&#xD;
"Then there's a fellow who has been through a Jesuit col-&#xD;
lege, and joined our class Junior year to strike for the honors,&#xD;
and is past twenty-"&#xD;
*"And is a better mathematician than you, Roosey-why don't&#xD;
you out with it like a man?" said Rosemary, laughing.&#xD;
" Well, he can't hold a candle to you, Rose-that's what I&#xD;
tell 0 Morra, that I have a cousin at home -"&#xD;
In petticoats," said Rosemary, with a gay smile.&#xD;
"No, I don't say that; but a young lady, I tell him, who can&#xD;
beat him at the blackboard any day."&#xD;
" Is that Cabal O'Mbrra's son ?" asked Atherton.&#xD;
"The same-a splendid fellow, I must say," answered Varick,&#xD;
generously. "He knows more Latin than any man in our class,&#xD;
but I beat him in Greek."&#xD;
" Ah, the Jesuits are not Greeks but Romans !" said Mr.&#xD;
Atherton, laughing.&#xD;
"I say it isn't fair a man should take the Greek salutatory, who&#xD;
didn't learn Latin at Columbia. Greek ought to be the test in&#xD;
such a case. If O'Morra gets marked above me in the trage-&#xD;
dies, I'll Own beat," said Varick.&#xD;
Here a carriage was heard to stop, and Rosemary, saying&#xD;
quietly-" That's grandpapa !"-ran out to meet them. Mr.&#xD;

&#xD;
and Mrs. Dashon presently entered, the former leaning on his&#xD;
granddaughter's arm and walking slowly.&#xD;
In the conversation that ensued, justice was done to the social&#xD;
gossip of Washington for the lady, and to the political compli-&#xD;
cations for the gentleman. The young people listened, which&#xD;
young people now very seldom do. The regular thing would&#xD;
have been for Roosevelt and Rosemary to get into a corner and&#xD;
whisper, and laugh together, in short to carry on a flirtation;&#xD;
or perhaps their seniors might be obliging enough to vacate the&#xD;
drawing-room and take the library or dining-room for their&#xD;
own humdrum conversation. This is the excellent rule of some&#xD;
families. The Dashons had not yet adopted it. On the con-&#xD;
trary, had Miss Dashon presumed to flirt with anybody, or to&#xD;
make herself otherwise more conspicuous than became her&#xD;
years, she would have been sent to bed. Grandmamma was&#xD;
naturally more strict with a girl; besides which, the training&#xD;
of Rosemary had been done to her hand, and with all her&#xD;
spirit the child was as obedient as high principle and early&#xD;
habit can well make a human being.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Mr. Atherton," said grandmamma, at&#xD;
last, when the general topics had been run through. "I want&#xD;
to talk to you about Rose. She is a great deal too. religious, do&#xD;
you understand V"&#xD;
"Because since Lent began I go to church every morning,&#xD;
Mr. Atherton," said the young lady.&#xD;
" Before breakfast--do you understand ?" says grandmamma.&#xD;
"She goes to church. I say, every morning, before breakfast,&#xD;
and fasts three days in the week!'&#xD;
I merely abstain, grandmamma--I never fasted since I was&#xD;
born."&#xD;
"You don't eat meat, child,-it is the same thing. And what&#xD;
is worse, Mr. Atherton, although I have agreed that she may go&#xD;
to Mass every morning, and every evening too if she likes on&#xD;
condition that she does not alter her diet, she is so infatuated in&#xD;
her own way that she offers to give up going to church if I for-&#xD;
bid it, but absolutely refuses to obey me in the other particular,&#xD;
Which is much nore important to her health. A walk before&#xD;

breakfast I consider an advantage to any young person-do you&#xD;
understand ? but fish three times a week ! !"&#xD;
Atherton laughed heartily.&#xD;
"You know, grandmamma, that I have always abstained from&#xD;
meat on the regular days since I was six years old."&#xD;
"Before which you never ate any at all, child. That was&#xD;
well enough when you were a little girl-but at your age it is&#xD;
different. You require beef, mutton, steaks, cutlets, roast-tur-&#xD;
key, partridge, venison-a little every day. But no! Made.&#xD;
moiselle has a terribly obstinate will-do you understand? She&#xD;
is immoveable as a rock. So on Wednesday, Friday and Sat-&#xD;
urday, we are obliged to have turtle-soup, oysters, salmon (in&#xD;
cans, you know, Mr. Atherton), and rock-fish, which grandpapa&#xD;
is so indulgent as to have sent on from Baltimore in ice-do&#xD;
you understand '? I tell him he spoils the child. She is grow-&#xD;
ing thin-"&#xD;
"Oh, grandmamma! I am plump as a partridge !"-And she&#xD;
held out gaily her rounded arms,&#xD;
"And losing her color---"&#xD;
The girl's cheek was bright at the moment as a new-blown&#xD;
rose.&#xD;
".And in short, my opinion is that made-moi-selle thinks her-&#xD;
self nearly a saint already ! I am expecting every day to hear&#xD;
that she is going to take the veil-do you understand? Now&#xD;
what shall we do, Mr. Atherton ?"&#xD;
"Send her to a convent-school for a year or two," said the&#xD;
statesman.&#xD;
"A capital idea !" cried grandmamma. "To dissipate the&#xD;
illusions of her imagination-do you understand ?"&#xD;
"Send the child away to school, my dear !" said grandpapa,&#xD;
reproachfully.&#xD;
"It is better to be deprived of her society for a year ortwo,&#xD;
than to lose her entirely," replied grandmamma.&#xD;
"Mr. Atherton rose and took leave of Mr. and Mrs. Dashon&#xD;

her hands.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
MATRIMONY IN THE HORIZON.&#xD;
AT the ever-memorable battle of Balaklava, Gen. Romarin,&#xD;
attached to the stat-major of the Army of the East, where his&#xD;
knowledge of English made him a necessity of the first order,&#xD;
was hit by a Russian bullet. His life was saved by the circum-&#xD;
stance that the ball impinged exactly upon a large gold medal&#xD;
of the Immaculate Conception sent him by his granddaughter,&#xD;
and which, at her earnest prayer, he wore during the campaign.&#xD;
The old soldier of the empire was a bit of a philosophe, as we&#xD;
have intimated ; he attached small faith to the miraculous&#xD;
medal, but anything that his grandchild asked he was ready to&#xD;
do if possible, and medal or no medal, it could do no harm (he&#xD;
argued) to a veteran in the fire of Russian batteries that a pure&#xD;
young girl across the seas lifted her daily prayer to Heaven for&#xD;
his safety. The Emperor covered the hole of the bull t in the&#xD;
old officer's uniform with the grand cross of the Legion of&#xD;
Honor. Romarin's star was in the ascendant: it was a war of&#xD;
engineers, and his mathematical head was of more value than&#xD;
the dash of the African generals. Grandmamma Dashon was&#xD;
never weary of dilating on this subject to her visitors. The&#xD;
name of Romarin became a household word with the Dashons.&#xD;
It was curious and instructive to see how proud they were of a&#xD;
connection of which they had once been ashamed.&#xD;
"My granddaughter has just had a lettter from her grandpapa&#xD;
Romarin," Mrs. Dashon would say, "dated from the Camp before&#xD;
Sebastopol. Gen. Romarin, you know, is attached to the stat-&#xD;
major of the Army of the East. My son--you remember-.&#xD;
married the only daughter of General Romarin. He says that&#xD;
the Russians keep up an incessant fire on the advanced posts of&#xD;
the allies, and that he does not think the place can be carried by&#xD;

240                    ROSEMARY.&#xD;
a coup de main. Do you understand ? Gen. Ro-ma-rin thinks&#xD;
that a coup-de-main is impracticable ! That signifies that the&#xD;
allies must make it a regular siege. It may cost them a year's&#xD;
hard work.   What a war !   But Gen., Romarin's life is safe&#xD;
amid the fire of the Russians-do you understand I My grand-&#xD;
daughter has sent him a miraculous medal, which he wears, to&#xD;
please her, constantly on his breast, and it is a fact that he was&#xD;
hit there by a bullet at Balaklava, while the French staff were&#xD;
gazing with their mouths open"--with her shortest laugh-" at&#xD;
the charge of the famous six hundred! That's a curious coin-&#xD;
cidence, is it not ? However, the Emperor has sent him the&#xD;
grand cross-that's a comfort. Well, it is a fine thing for our&#xD;
little girl, this distinction of her maternal grandfather. My son&#xD;
also was a brave man, and died fighting for France."&#xD;
Grandmamma Dashon was persuaded that the Emperor would&#xD;
eventually make Gen. Romarin a marshal and a duke; it even&#xD;
occurred to her that if (which Heaven forbid) the gout should&#xD;
finally carry off poor Mr. Dashon, she might after all marry her&#xD;
first love, and shine in the new court of France as duchess of&#xD;
Tchernaya or some other euphonious title taken from the Turk-&#xD;
ish wars. As for Rosemary, her plan was to keep the child as&#xD;
much as possible secluded from American society, to take her&#xD;
to Paris as soon as peace was concluded, and there marry her to&#xD;
a duke at the very least. The granddaughter of Gen. (perhaps&#xD;
Mardchal) Romarin, sprung from the Flordal, decayed noblesse&#xD;
of a sufficiently high and pure descent, and a wealthy heiress&#xD;
above all :-for what was ancient blood or imperialist illustra-&#xD;
tion, compared with the millions of grandpapa Dashon ? Trans-&#xD;
late them into francs, and the sum was enormous. An heiress&#xD;
ticketed with that amount would command universal attention&#xD;
in any court of Christendom (if that term can be any longer&#xD;
employed.)&#xD;
Grandpapa Dashon did not sympathize with his wife's dreams.&#xD;
He was fonder of their grandchild, whom he did not care to&#xD;
spare for any grand European marriage, nor yet to sink his&#xD;
name and fortune in refurbishing the splendor of some great&#xD;
family who would always be ashamed of the benefit. Mr.&#xD;
Dashon was ambitious of founding a great American family.&#xD;
&#xD;
MATRIMONY IN THE 'HORIZON.&#xD;
&#xD;
His plan was that whoever married Rosemary should take the&#xD;
name of Dashoni, and he designed so to leave his fortune that&#xD;
the bulk of it would ultimately devolve unimpaired,  ay&#xD;
immensely augmented, on her eldest son. His first candidate&#xD;
was Capt. Varick, and when the hasty marriage of that impa-&#xD;
tt sailor with a Miss Laura Somebody, sister of the keeper&#xD;
of a boarding-house, where he was spending a few weeks ashore&#xD;
isappoimted this expectation, he turned his eyes favorably upon&#xD;
his. grand-nephew Cornelius, named after him by the long-&#xD;
sighted parents, and the only male creature except himself, in&#xD;
whm flowed any of the blood of the Dashons. The ingenious&#xD;
EOfise"gntlemaowho then kept what he called a "Heraldry&#xD;
Office" in New York, had investigated Mr. aho'yedge&#xD;
and discovered that h, a  netiae      "r Dashon's pedigree&#xD;
aod discovee was descended from the Norman family&#xD;
of d'Ashon, who possessed the title and barony of Ashon from the&#xD;
conquest till the reign of Henry VI., when they Were all exter-&#xD;
thinated in the wars of the Roses. What was more certain was&#xD;
that Mr. Dashon's father was the son of a New England sea-&#xD;
captain, andmseta considerable property in the cod-&#xD;
fisheries and set up his son as an India merchant: in the great&#xD;
house of Roosevelt and Varick, after the war of the Revolution&#xD;
was over; so that the family had a respectable commercial&#xD;
ancestry of three generations, terminating in a colossal fortune&#xD;
built up, after signal reverses, by Roosevelt Dashon himself&#xD;
Younghrnelius Roosevelt. Dashon Varick, we repeat, by his&#xD;
mother partook of this honorable family's blood, and since the&#xD;
egregious folly of his cousin the captain, he was the matri..&#xD;

&#xD;
first three in his class, his noble head and intellectual counte-&#xD;
nance caused this slight personal disadvantage to be forgotten.&#xD;
his cousin was there, looking her prettiest, and joined enthusi.&#xD;
astically in the plaudits which i ewartied his SOCCeSS. G ai mdIapa&#xD;
used to take advantage of the frequent occasions aff ried by&#xD;
his visits to Rosemary, which he made regularly every Thurs-&#xD;
day, and duriing the vacations, to speak to her of her cousin in&#xD;
terms of praise; and the gipsy, who had as fine a tact in these&#xD;
matters as a kitten in chasing a spool of cotton on the carpet,&#xD;
understood grand papa's wishes perfectly.&#xD;
There was one element which none of these worthy people&#xD;
took into their calculation, and that was the possible views and&#xD;
certain influence of grandpapa Romarin. The old soldier,&#xD;
es-teacher, ex-artist, had his own ideas about Rosemary's&#xD;
future, and knowing the rapid maturity of American girls,&#xD;
deemed it not unadvisable to steal a march on her possible&#xD;
American lovers or suitors. In France these matters are ar-&#xD;
ranged between the parents of the young people. Romarin's&#xD;
thoughts were naturally directed to the illustrations of the&#xD;
empire for a suitable parti. He was quite aware that if his&#xD;
grandchild's future husband was to be French, he must be a&#xD;
person of rank: for nothing else would reconcile the other&#xD;
grandpapa to the choice, and the other grandpapa's fortune was&#xD;
not to be forfeited. But in spite of his impel ialist predilections,&#xD;
his family connections led him in a family affair to the old fan-&#xD;
bourg. The Marquis de Flordal, first cousin of Madame Rora-&#xD;
rin (Rosemary's maternal grandmother), was still living in Paris,&#xD;
and had a grandson in the army, the Vicomnte de Floi al, the last&#xD;
male scion of the house into which Romarin had mar ied. They&#xD;
were poor as church mice, without being so devout. The arrival&#xD;
of Capt. Romnarin, widower of their late cousin, was an event&#xD;
almost as important to this decayed house as tie revolution of&#xD;
'48. The Abbe de Floreal, brother of the mar quis, called on&#xD;
Capt. Romarin, soon after the election of Louis Napoleon to the&#xD;
Presidency. After the coup d'itat the maiquis himself put his&#xD;
legitimist and aristocratic dignity in his pocket, and paid a visit&#xD;
to General de Romarin. By and by, one took informations in&#xD;
the family Flordal touching the descendants of their rising rela-&#xD;
&#xD;
tive. One learned with tremulous satisfaction that his only&#xD;
representative was a granddaughter whowas               n&#xD;
incredible heiress. One inquired heraw her education and&#xD;
learned with a sense of Providential guidance , ha euaing&#xD;

the abb6. In fine, after man  f       ,said the marquis to&#xD;

to propose to General de Romarin a matrimonial aline'ewe&#xD;

bivouac, dining on the ground, and drinking his coffee and&#xD;
thimble-full of cognac with such a soldier-like carelessness and&#xD;
good humor, that Romarin's military heart was won. Floral&#xD;
was liked by his equals, esteemed by his superiors, and a pet&#xD;
with the rank and file. He had the gay, chivalrous courage of&#xD;
the French noble in its perfection, and though a noble he had&#xD;
learned as a private the equality of a camp. Romaiin reflected&#xD;
that afterall in a French husband his granddaughter might do&#xD;
worse. The young man could certainly make her a vicomtesse,&#xD;
and one day a marquise ; she cpuld restore the grandeur of the-&#xD;
Flordals. After all, they were the kindred of his beloved wife,&#xD;
and although at one time they had not ti eated either her or him&#xD;
too well, he liked a noble revenge. So on the whole be deter-&#xD;
mined to write to Mr. Dashon and inform him of the proposal&#xD;
which had been made.&#xD;
"You will comprehend," he wrote, "that with the Floreal the&#xD;
young lady's expected fortune is a principal consideration.&#xD;
They are among the poorest of our impoverished nobility: it is&#xD;
their only fault. Their blood is of the most ancient in the&#xD;
kingdom or empire of France; they are allied to the noblest&#xD;
houses. They want but fortune, of which our granddaughter&#xD;
will have enough. The young vicomte, moreover, is a brave&#xD;
fellow, very amiable, very handsome, and has not vices. Can&#xD;
one well ask more ' I await a reply from you before answer-&#xD;
ing definitely the Floreal."&#xD;
One of the bombs with which the allies were so freely shelling&#xD;
Sebastopol, had it plumped down in grandpapa Dashon's urban&#xD;
garden, would not have caused the excitement this letter did.&#xD;
Grandmammfa was in raptures, yet thought Rosemary could do&#xD;
better.  Grandpapa was hostile, yet feared that opposition&#xD;
would only league Mrs. Dashon and.Gen. Romarin together to&#xD;
accomplish the project. The Varicks were thunderstruck at&#xD;
the audacity of theFrench, and that light and hardy dash so&#xD;
chaiacteIistic, which boded the capture of the fortress.  In&#xD;
the family councils no two persons were of the same opi-&#xD;
nion and at last grandpapa made a bold move by proposing&#xD;
that as Rose was nearly eighteen, and at home, she should be&#xD;
&#xD;
MATRIMONY IN THE HORIZON.&#xD;
consulted on the subject.  Grandpapa Romarin's lett&#xD;
accordingly submitted to her inspection.&#xD;
This is not a subject in regard to which I can have wishes of&#xD;
my own, said the young lady with a suitable blush. "What.&#xD;
ever you and my grandpapa Romarin decide, I will abide by."&#xD;
It was an answer which French parents would have tak&#xD;
a matter of course ; Rosemary made it, as she would as&#xD;
owed at an introduction, because it was the rule. She had&#xD;
been told so a hundred times bygrandpapa Romarin and Lo&#xD;
and Mirs. Atherton had assured her it was all right. Nothing was&#xD;
more deeply ingrained in her way of thinking than the indeli-&#xD;
cacy of a young Woman's expressing a preference on the subject&#xD;
of matrimony.  Grandpapa and grandmamma Dashos were&#xD;
sorely perplexed by this simplicity.&#xD;
As we have already implied, they had taken Mr. Athero's&#xD;
shrewd advice by sending their granddaughter to finisher&#xD;
education at-the Academy of the Sacred Heart. Rosemary did&#xD;
not learn much mathematics at that singularly beautiful s&#xD;
once the seat of the Lorillards-for at her entrance he&#xD;
more than the accomplished Religious who taught that brnch&#xD;
of study; she needed no further instruction in French, which&#xD;
the strong point of the school; even in music she could do little&#xD;
but practise under careful supervision and perfect herself as&#xD;
lave done at home; but the ladies discover&#xD;
she had a remarkable voice, they made her cultiscovered that&#xD;
became the pride of the school; as she had an aptitude forilan-&#xD;
guages, she willingly added Spanish, German, and Italiran--&#xD;
her list; and the Professor of history found her a atIian to&#xD;
diligent pupil. After nearly two years, instead of wishing to&#xD;
return home and enter society, she was anxious t remaig to&#xD;
the conclusion of the current session. Yet with all her stu-&#xD;
dious diligence, the child had contrived to pick u erasty&#xD;
of knowledge on subjects not laid down in the course andain&#xD;
regard to which a society of young girls are to eachour anh&#xD;
most adroit and successful of teachers ; and when summoned  he&#xD;

and decided opinions on the subject of silks, that convinced her&#xD;
grandmother of the sagacity of Mr. Atherton.&#xD;
"A young lady who is so positive about the trimming of her&#xD;
new bonnet, and tries on a dozen of Madame Ruban's chefs&#xD;
d'cuvre before she can be suited, is not likely to take the&#xD;
veil very soon," said grandmamma, laughing. "And she may&#xD;
pin her shawl as high in the throat as she chooses, or let her&#xD;
mailtie fall ever so reservedly, as she trips along from the car-&#xD;
riage to the shop-door-as if anybody could overlook the testi-&#xD;
mony of that charming carriage of the shoulders or that bound-&#xD;
ing step-do you understand ? Ah, 'tis a. finished coquette, my&#xD;
elegant granddaughter, with all her maidenly shyness, si pleine&#xD;
defiert."-The old lady sighed.-" I was a good deal like her&#xD;
at her age, though never half so handsome, you understand."&#xD;
In fine, Mr. Dashon wrote to Gen. Romarin the following&#xD;
reply :&#xD;
"NEW YORK, Dec. 5, 1854.&#xD;
"DEAR SIR,&#xD;
"Your favor of the 6th October is at hand, and&#xD;
the contents noted. Mrs. Dashon and myself have considered&#xD;
the proposal therein made, and have taken the liberty of show-&#xD;
ing the letter to our granddaughter. As she refers the matter&#xD;
entirely to us and to yourself, we have concluded to say that if&#xD;
the young Vicomte de Flordal should visit the United States, he&#xD;
.  ilhgve every facility, so far as depends on us, for making the&#xD;
acquaintance of Miss Dashon and winning her affections. On his&#xD;
success in the last-mentioned all further action must depend.&#xD;
"Very sincerely,&#xD;
f"Your friend and ser't,&#xD;
"C. ROOSEVELT DASHON.&#xD;
"To Gen. LoUIS DE ROMARIN,&#xD;
"Sebastopol."&#xD;
The Dashons hit upon this answer as one that did not compro-&#xD;
maise them at all and which left them a future liberty of accept-&#xD;
ing or rejecting the proposition of the Flordals. About three&#xD;
months, it was supposed, must elapse before a reply could be&#xD;
received, and probably as many more before the young man&#xD;
could arrive in the United States, if the war should even permit&#xD;
him to come at all. Consequently the operators at home would&#xD;

MATRIMONY IN THE HORIZON.              247&#xD;
have a large margin to forestall the market, as Mr. Dash&#xD;
served. Rosemary, it was decided, should go into  o&#xD;
winter ; it is the auction-Lock fth  u oit society this&#xD;
winer;it s te actin~blok of the superior classes, where&#xD;
the young and beautiful whites of the North  eo sesae&#xD;
to the iiglhet bidder. Mr. Dashon insisted ex osed to sale&#xD;
offered at home,' before she was taken abroad to dispose of; the&#xD;
home market, in his opinion, being always the best.  o ; the&#xD;
buy ers prepared: a lively competition was certain, when as i&#xD;
this case an immense property was to o for  aen, wheniai n&#xD;
every unmarried gentleman with browner er andethi'ske&#xD;
considered himself as sure of the prize  veand   mw  rs&#xD;
considered that to break a dozen hearts or ih  wngrandmama&#xD;
young lady no harm as a prelude to the reates Ewoue  other&#xD;
paign. In the meantime this young vicomte was a bird in the&#xD;
hand. One might do worse than that. But reflecting thus,&#xD;
grand mamma began to understand Rosemary bette.&#xD;
"Wha shuldshehave answered, but what she did? The little&#xD;
puss (Rosemary was five foot five) newhat she  wa abot&#xD;
She wasn't going to refuse a handsome young vicomte at the&#xD;

like the fellow, she will find a way of letting it be known, I war-&#xD;
rant you. One munt have been a girl one's self, to divin the&#xD;
secret of a girl's proceedings--do you understand ?"&#xD;
However, the grand epoch of Miss Dashon's apearanc-&#xD;
society was reserved for a ball which Mrs. Dashon proposed&#xD;
give early in January, consequently when the eighteenth-irth&#xD;
day had fully passed. Till then she accepted none but quiet&#xD;
still ting    s, and few of those, on the pretext that she was -&#xD;
ing lessons. This was so far true that theyoung lady&#xD;
practised her music two hours a day with a professor at her&#xD;
elbow, an ugly married man (Madam remembered Roearir), and&#xD;
read the English Poets three times a week with a limarman&#xD;
old enough to be her father,w and who was also married. It was&#xD;
a lymxeyed grs vigilant, indeed, as to excite the&#xD;
suspicion, that she had once needed watching herself.&#xD;

respondence with her friend Grace Atherton, who bad completed&#xD;
her fifteenth year and wrote Rosemary very long and beautiful&#xD;
letters, and a specimen of the latter's style of reply will at this&#xD;
juncture throw some light on our narrative. The letter seems to&#xD;
have been written about Christmas, for the date, originally placed&#xD;
at the end, has been torn off.&#xD;
"My DEAREST GRACE,&#xD;
"Your long interesting letter (and so fll&#xD;
of sympathy and kindness for me!) is received and' devoured,'&#xD;
as y on often say. It gratifies me exceedingly that your mother&#xD;
(I look upon her as mine too) approves my conduct in regard&#xD;
to the proposal from France. Grandmamma seems to like it&#xD;
too on the whole, although at first she was dissatisfied with&#xD;
what she called 'my indifference.' I believe she gives me credit&#xD;
now for a profound calculation, of which my poor head is quite&#xD;
incapable. Certainly I shall never be anything better than a&#xD;
simpleton in these affairs, which the merest little chits at the&#xD;
convent seemed to understand better than I, and as I never&#xD;
opened my lips on the subject except to get laughed at, I learned&#xD;
to hold my tongue. Your familiarity with it, my dear, perfectly&#xD;
astonishes me, and I cannot conceive how you, who have never&#xD;
been at school and have seen less of society than even myself,&#xD;
can have acquired such precise ideas of many things which, to&#xD;
own the truth, I never thought of. All my comfort is that at least&#xD;
six months must certainly elapse before this 'handsome young&#xD;
vicnmte' can arrive here, if he comes at all, (which I very much&#xD;
doubt, rnoi!) and in the meantime I intend to banish tie thought&#xD;
of the 'cruel perplexity' (as you call it) which he is to cause&#xD;
me, entirely from my mind, and enjoy myself as if no such per-&#xD;
son existed.&#xD;
,"In regard to bonnets, dearest, the new winter style is&#xD;
smaller than ever, and more off the back of the head, and they&#xD;
are one mass of flowers, ribbons, plumes and lace. Grand-&#xD;
mamma has a perfectly splendid one, with a bird of Paradise&#xD;
plume. Mine is an uncut rose velvet (the girls all wear velvet&#xD;
this season), trimmed with very rich ribbons ; not a flower or&#xD;
scrap of lace about it. You have no idea how distinguished&#xD;
and how charming it is, especially \as my front hair is so abund-&#xD;

but white. M y winter furs are e      .o hv  n  just like it,&#xD;

rich as my clothes are-for grandmanhe will suffer nothing&#xD;
else-there needs a very great simplicity, you know offeserve&#xD;
the air of bing demoiselle, which I should be sorry to misserv&#xD;
very first winter. I should be cruelly mortified if even a ryosy&#xD;
goods' clerk should mistake me for a married lady, as Augusta&#xD;
Varick is. The other day Augusta and I shopped together in&#xD;
graundmamma's carriage, and I declare in every store the clerks&#xD;
called her 'madam,' and 'missed' me all the time, as if I had&#xD;
been a little gii. I was delighted, and I think A&#xD;
was flattered! You know she is a year younger than Is Will&#xD;
you credit, Grace, that I had the malice to say 'Yes, ma'am'&#xD;
and 'No, ia'am' to her, to keep up the mistake? And to hear&#xD;
her call me fRose' so gravely--it was as good as a pla  You&#xD;
would hardly know Augusta, she is stall, and   e a.  ou&#xD;
mature, though very handsome. Her figure is extremely faceys&#xD;
anl she wears her dresses very full, with enormeo y showy,&#xD;
and such a.stylish bonnet! No one takes notice of me bed&#xD;
her. You must know that there is a little rivalry between&#xD;
Augusta and me, though we are on the best of&#xD;
sonally ; and perhaps I should rather say that ti ers&#xD;
between her mother and grandmamm    about us le rivalry is&#xD;
Isabel (that's Mrs. Varick, you remember) wants Augusta to&#xD;
make a greater sensation this winter, and have more buxtand&#xD;
better offers than I. I am sure this is very natural, and j&#xD;
don't see why she shouldn't. Grandpapa lets every   know&#xD;
at he means to treat both cousin Isabel's children as grand&#xD;
children, which makes their position excellent, as grand-namma&#xD;
says. And I am sure Augusta has- ten times  e tyle th&#xD;
have, and knows so much better how to make her points. For&#xD;
instance,--now don't set this down to malice Gre, forts dor&#xD;
mean it--Augusta has a pretty foot and ancle ace r  d&#xD;

&#xD;
at doing what I cannot help. So you see I have no courage&#xD;
or manner ; and she has. Then she has so much more conver-&#xD;
sation-with gentlemen, I nean. What to say to them, I cannot&#xD;
think. One can't talk about one's bonnet and the new fashions&#xD;
-that ought not to interest them particularly. I make fright-&#xD;
ful efforts, and by aid of the opera, the last novel (I read it on&#xD;
purpose), and the new dances (which I dislike, dear), I manage&#xD;
to get through decently, and am devoutly glad when it's over,&#xD;
and so they are too, I suspect ; while Augusta keeps up a per-&#xD;
petual easy talk, and is so amusing that both parties seem to be&#xD;
laughing at every other word. What the secret is, I cannot even&#xD;
guess.&#xD;
" Augusta's brother is quite a beau, the girls say, and though&#xD;
he is short,-not much taller than dear Bessie the last time I saw&#xD;
her,-makes them all afraid of Lim. Would you believe that he&#xD;
has the handsomest whiskers you ever saw, and is but a few&#xD;
months past eighteen ! I shouldn't mind his whiskers-after all&#xD;
they are a good deal like side curls-but Roosevelt's mustaches&#xD;
are detestable for a boy of his age. For 'detestable,' dear,&#xD;
read 'adorable,' so far as their becomingness is concerned, if&#xD;
they did not make him look so fierce and ruthless. He has a&#xD;
handsome mouth, and that spoils it. Then he is so terribly sar-&#xD;
castic. Oh my goodness! what a tongue ! so glib and so bitter.&#xD;
He tries every way he can to make up for his want of height,&#xD;
which is an incessant mortification to the poor boy. He has&#xD;
learned to box and fence, which is ridiculous, you know, though&#xD;
he is one mass of muscle. Dear me! how he hurt my hand the&#xD;
other day, in mere sport ! But he is a dead shot both with the&#xD;
pistol and the rifle, and no one ventures to take liberties with&#xD;
him, I promise you. Roosevelt has been my cavalier all the&#xD;
autumn, while the weather permitted riding. Perhaps you'll&#xD;
wonder that I never spoke of it before. Grandpapa, you know,&#xD;
is very fond of Roosevelt, who was named after him, and Roose-&#xD;
velt talks of changing his surname from Varick to Dashon, he&#xD;
has taken such a disgust for sone of his father's family. His&#xD;
father and he are on very bad terms, I am sorry to say. Mr.&#xD;
Varick's habits are no better, grandpapa says, since he so mys-&#xD;
teriously lost his election. He drinks and worse, which I sup-&#xD;
&#xD;
pose means gaming: it is really dreadful. Roosevelt knows all&#xD;
about it Iowever, he does not appear to have injured his for-&#xD;
tune by play, for they live in the most splendid style, and grand-&#xD;
mamma says there is not another woman in New York who&#xD;
dresses so expensively as cousin Isabel. Oh, my dearest Grace&#xD;
what sad gossip this is; but it is the only way I have to fill my&#xD;
sheet; I have not your epistolary talent, to write a beautiful and&#xD;
long letter about nothing at all. I must now close with a thou-&#xD;
sand affectionate messages and embraces for Bessie and your&#xD;
mother. As for Eugene, kiss the little fellow for Rosy, and tell&#xD;
him she's dreadful sorry he is not twenty years older. Remem-&#xD;
ber that I live in hopes of seeing you, as you promise before&#xD;
New Year. Pray a great deal for your poor friend amid the en-&#xD;
snaring pleasures of the world. I am almost afraid that I shall&#xD;
lose my soul, my dearest child, so'please not to forget.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
AN fIPERIAL PRESENT.&#xD;
GEN. ROMARIN'S reply to Mr. Dashon's letter arrived a great&#xD;
deal sooner than anybody    expected.  The same steamer&#xD;
brought a letter for Rosemary from her grandfather, dated at&#xD;
Paris. She received it on that sadly joyful anniversary of her&#xD;
birth, the New Year; day on which she "received" for the first&#xD;
time with her grandmother, in honor of the completion of her&#xD;
eighteentlh year. Before she had left her room, or had received&#xD;
the congratulations of her grandparents, the letter was brought,&#xD;
her by Louise, as an embrace from grandpapa Romarin, and ac-&#xD;
companied by a box containing doubtless some pretty present.&#xD;
"You will be surprised, my dear child," wrote'&#xD;
"at the date of this letter. In effect, H. M. the&#xD;
of genius doubtless, of military genius even, has ha  idea of&#xD;
taking Sebastopol and conquering the Russians from his cabinet&#xD;
in the Tuileries-by telegraph. It has been thought fit to send&#xD;
me to Paris to demonstrate to His/'Majesty that it is iot thus one&#xD;
can foil the immense activity and foresee even the inspirations,&#xD;
ten times brilliant, and sudden as the lightning, of a Todleben.&#xD;
The task was not a gracions one; behold why it was committed&#xD;
to me : at least no one has envied me the mission. See me then&#xD;
for these four days closeted with the Emperor, who lacks only&#xD;
experience of war to be a great commander. He possesses all&#xD;
the general conceptions with an admirable clearness. I have&#xD;
convinced him; it is a great deal; for if there is in Europe a&#xD;
man of fixed ideas, it is Napoleon III. I have said to him :-- It&#xD;
Is in Italy, in combat with the Austrians, that the Emperor&#xD;
gained his first laurels : your Majesty. must do the same.'-I&#xD;

The manner how these things-box and letters-had reached&#xD;
them was at first a mystery, till the morning papers explained it.&#xD;
They contained an arrival from Europe-" Latest from Sebas-&#xD;
topol," &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.; and in the list of passengers was men-&#xD;
tioned: "Le Col. vicomte de Flordal, with despatches for the.&#xD;
French Minister." On inquiry it was found that both letters&#xD;
and parcel had been left at Mr. Dashon's door, at an early hour,&#xD;
by a foreign gentleman in a carriage ; doubtless Col. de Flordal&#xD;
on his way to the New Jersey R. R. depot, en route for the&#xD;
Federal Capital.&#xD;

the day that Thdrese de Rohrrohrsdah         Annually, on&#xD;

ath o creard of the Cathedral, there to hang a fresh&#xD;
wreath of rosemary on the tomb-stone and afterwards to pray&#xD;
in the church for her mother's repose. It was an ancintusg&#xD;
in the Romarin family, which  9  -I    a   nacient usage&#xD;

A CHAPEL SCENE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ment of a neighboring church. It was not quite four ; the sun&#xD;
did not set till thirteen minutes to five; she might easily, she&#xD;
thought, accomplish her purpose and reach home again before&#xD;
the last ray of the winter twilight faded. On entering the chapel&#xD;
Rosemary started back with an exclamation of dismay.&#xD;
It was filled to stifling. A sort of steam  rose from the&#xD;
benches where long lines of penitents sat patiently waiting&#xD;
their turn to enter the confessionals, of which some seven or&#xD;
eight were in full operation. However, with a look of resig-&#xD;
nation the heiress of the Dashons picked her way among a&#xD;
kneeling crowd, and dropped upon the floor at last at the end&#xD;
of a file of servant girls. Looking down the line, which con-&#xD;
ducted to one side of a confessional box, the young lady counted&#xD;
twenty persons, all females; a similar line extended to the other&#xD;
side of the same box; thus there were forty consciences to be&#xD;
unburdened before her turn would come. Rosemary's arithme-&#xD;
tic speedily discovered that allowing five minutes as the average&#xD;
of a confession, these forty persons, and two actually in the&#xD;
box, would detain her three hours and thirty minutes, that is,&#xD;
till half-past seven o'clock. She hoped that some providential&#xD;
intervention would shorten the period, and patiently kneeled&#xD;
on, heartily wishing that she had gone to confession in the&#xD;
morning; a wish that came too late.&#xD;
After a while they began to move up rapidly ; some regular&#xD;
penitents hardly took a minute; Rosemary got a seat.-" Now,"&#xD;
thought she, "I will wait, no matter how long they are."&#xD;
The very next penitent was terrible. You would have sworn&#xD;
she was making a general confession of her whole .life, by the&#xD;
time she took. The females near Rosemary sighed, some&#xD;
groaned, one young girl got up impatiently and went away,&#xD;
losing all her time spent previously. Miss Dashon gained one&#xD;
by that move. The gas had been lit in the chapel a great while&#xD;
ago; she saw by her watch that it was past. the dinner hour;&#xD;
it was long after dark; she smiled at the idea of grandmamma's&#xD;
terrors on her account, and yet her heart sank too; but to give&#xD;
up after waiting so long was not to be thought of. Undoubtedly&#xD;
it would occur to them that she was at church, and they would&#xD;
send a servant to come home with her.&#xD;
&#xD;
At last, at half-past six, when she Was onl&#xD;
theconfessional, and was beginning  ta only five distant from&#xD;
came out to go to his tea. Rosemary sighed;  he, benhepriest&#xD;
as full as ever.--" Poo'mnb' t,-the benches were&#xD;
as fime as everePoor man !"thought she, -he has the hard.&#xD;
est time of it after all." I  wny  iue  h  lrya&#xD;
In twenty minutes the cergmnreund.Afllhu&#xD;
elapsed ; Miss Dashon wa algymnreturned. A full hour&#xD;
elaped;MissDa~onvas at last next the confessional, when&#xD;
the cry of an infit was heard in the chasing gen&#xD;
consternation, which soon became particular. A lay-broter&#xD;
came to that very box, the priest again left ita An tyother&#xD;
put on a surplice, and proceeded with  e  went to the altar,&#xD;
tize the child. This consumed fifteen  t rec ieaioum n  ora.&#xD;
The next two penitents took hardly pcius mutes more,&#xD;
as an indescribable movement with  a minute each, when just&#xD;
that that side would be presently vacated  t   warned her&#xD;
really come, a man (by his voice she knew it tha eturn)&#xD;
bent over her shoulder and said--" Will   was a gentleman)&#xD;
before you ?"-Rosemary bowed withoutlk aw him      Thag&#xD;
obliged her to wait wotrso-out looking at him. That&#xD;
oblge  hr t wittwo turns more ; besides which the young&#xD;
ladies below her were quite indignant e   er whisyng&#xD;
"Never mind !'' thloughtshe "itgt  at heer complaisance...-.&#xD;
"Nevr mnd !' tougt shle:"i is a man, and it is well to get&#xD;

,had no right to complain-djhatv could a man do?  Kneel down&#xD;
on the floor among their petticoats to wait his turn?  That was&#xD;
too much to expect. In fine, after spending hos  ou s The&#xD;
chapel, breathing that irrespirable air, her own confession took&#xD;
about one minute, and she found herself saying her innocent&#xD;
penance of the "Acts," and distracted by thinking howce&#xD;
would get home alone.y                     i    g      she&#xD;
Rosemary was not a coward; neither the lateness of the hour&#xD;
nor the darkness, nor being alone in the street, terrified hr,&#xD;
but she was troubled by the thought of he  at,rtenfied her,&#xD;
ion.-" In grandmamma's opinion," said she, "thisenilldiscre&#xD;
greatest sin I ever committed in rny life" She  s will be the&#xD;
for an acquaintance ; not one was to be seen. Two girls were&#xD;
going out together---she hastily joined them.&#xD;
" Excuse me," said Rosemary, "which way are you going'1"&#xD;
"To the Ninth avenue," answered the girls  e&#xD;

&#xD;
"Oh, no matter-I thought you might. be going the other&#xD;
way."&#xD;
This was in the vestibule. The girls never offered to go home&#xD;
with her, they were belated, and did not appreciate the neces-&#xD;
sity. A man going out, who had turned back at the sound of&#xD;
the voices, stopped and addressed Rosemary.&#xD;
"If you will accept my escort, madam," he said, in a tone of&#xD;
cheerful respect, "my way will be the same as yours till you&#xD;
reach home."&#xD;
Rosemary thanked the stranger, and promptly named the&#xD;
street and avenue.&#xD;
" All right," said the young man, leading on. She knew it&#xD;
was a young man by the voice, and as they passed under the&#xD;
lamp of the court, she caught a glimpse of his face, which was&#xD;
one to inspire confidence. Besides, had he not just come from&#xD;
confession? In a certain sense they were acquaintances, lie&#xD;
was rather tall, and kept straight on with long manly strides.&#xD;
"I ought to thank you, madam, for letting me go into con-&#xD;
fession before you," said her companion, as they walked rapidly&#xD;
along the avenue. "Or, perhaps I should apologize for asking&#xD;
tha' favor. My excuse is that it was my only chance."&#xD;
" Thoso girls monopolize the benches entirely," observed&#xD;
Rosemary. "I have always thought that one side of every box&#xD;
ought to be kept free for men."&#xD;
"It is really too bad," said the stranger, pleasantly.' "If we&#xD;
only had the precedence on one side-the right to cut in, as I&#xD;
did to-night, thanks to you !"--And he laughed, with evident&#xD;
satisfaction at his own manoeuvre. "It was a favor on your&#xD;
part, but it ought to be a right on ours-don't you think so?"&#xD;
"The Fathers have so much to think of," replied Rosemary,&#xD;
amused at his boyish tone.&#xD;
"Well, I wish they'd think of giving us a little fresh air in&#xD;
that chapel-if only for their own sakes. Some day, one of&#xD;
them will drop down in the confessional' in an apoplexy-that&#xD;
is, asphyxiated with bad air. It is a perfect disgrace to hear&#xD;
confessions in a basement in such a city as this. Yet they do&#xD;
it everywhere. I wish I were rich !"&#xD;
"What would you do ?" asked Rosemary.&#xD;
&#xD;
A CHAPEL SCENE.                   259&#xD;
"Certainly I would not live in one of these b&#xD;
aces, and let the Ark dwell in such a tent asrown stone pal&#xD;
build a suitable church for the Fathers, the first thing" d&#xD;
Without a basement; and the confessiondls all in the main&#xD;
church," said Rosemary,&#xD;
t You hit the idea exactly. They should b&#xD;
the walls of each aisle.,"&#xD;
"And one side of each box exclusively for the poor men I"&#xD;
s.id Rosemary, laughing. In the community       i&#xD;
quite forgot that it was a strangmernyo         ideas, she&#xD;
Here Rosemary slackened her pace before One of th '&#xD;

reached home.                                    who has&#xD;
"Au! you live here ?" said the stranger, touch'&#xD;
"1 will wait till they let you in."&#xD;
"Won't you come in, sir ?" said the high-bred h&#xD;
grandfather will be happy to offer you a glass of wine, and&#xD;
thank you for your courtesy."           gaso      ie   n&#xD;
The young man hesitated a moment, then refi&#xD;
that it would be less embarrassing to the young ladyif&#xD;
accepted the invitation, said-" I will make my bow to your&#xD;
grand father."                         em     o    oyu&#xD;
The servant opened the door before the bell&#xD;

absence. Grandmamma came out to meet her ntnalle&#xD;

"Good Heavens! at church! Why I have sent off&#xD;

mamma, politely, to the young stranger.&#xD;
He had removed his hat, and Rosemary, who turned to&#xD;
renew her- invitation, saw in the full illuminatin of t te  to&#xD;

king. She bit her lip, but grandpapa had now hobbled out,&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
"Please walk in, sir, and take a little old sherry this cold&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"I beg you will excuse me," replied the young stranger,&#xD;
whose eye roved with a grand careless surprise down the&#xD;
marble hall, and up the stair-case crowned with sculpture, but&#xD;
hardly vouchsafed a glance even at the ladies. "I have the&#xD;
honor to wish you good evening. Good evening, ladies."--And&#xD;
so departed.&#xD;
Then they all went into the dining-room, where the table was&#xD;
kept waiting for Miss Dashon.&#xD;
"I am almost famished, grandmamma," said Rose.&#xD;
There was great sympathy, innumerable questions, which&#xD;
the young lady answered while disposing of a partridge.&#xD;
"How kind you are not to scold me !" said she, laughing.&#xD;
"To have given you such a fright."&#xD;
"Who was your cavalier ?" asked grandmamma, carelessly.&#xD;
" Never saw him before in my life that I remember," said&#xD;
Rose, with equal carelessness.&#xD;
" He knew you, I suspect," said grandmamma.&#xD;
"I don't think so," answered Rosemary, blushing a little.&#xD;
" Well," said grandmamma, "I think that if M. le vicomte de&#xD;
Floral wants to make sure of his prize, he had better not stay&#xD;
too long in Washington, even 'on the service of the Emperor,'&#xD;
--do you understand V"&#xD;
In fact, the Colonel showed no remarkable eagerness in the&#xD;
affair. He had written from Washington t6 Mr. Dashon,&#xD;
announcing his arrival, and intention of reporting himself in&#xD;
New York as soon as public business permitted. The Dashons&#xD;
sent in answer a card f' r the ball. There the matter rested.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX,&#xD;
A RAILROAD AccIDENT.&#xD;
Nothingin uAmerica is more democratic than our modes of&#xD;
travel. In Europe they have first, second, third and fourth class&#xD;
railway cars. The first class are fitted up like luxurious private&#xD;
carriages, a separate seat for each person, cushionedhigh&#xD;
backed, elbowed, roomy, with from four to eight seats in a&#xD;
compartment, having a separate entrance; they are used by&#xD;
prie, nyofes people of fortune. Merchants, professional&#xD;
men, army officers, &amp;amp;c., usually take the second class, which&#xD;
arc less comfortable, each compartment holding perhaps a dozen&#xD;
persons, sitting face to face. The common people, according to&#xD;
heir means, ride in the third and fourth-class cars.&#xD;
In America, excepting a car for negroes, and the emigrant&#xD;
trains, the world goes pell-m ell, on a footing or sitting  of&#xD;
S publcan equality. A large car, in which we find a double&#xD;
row of cushioned seats, with backs to turn either way, gives you&#xD;
not only the advantage of complete community with perhaps&#xD;
fifersixty persons of mixed ranks, sexes, occupations and&#xD;
manners, but if you travel alone you may chance to get a very&#xD;
necruous and disagreeable companion on the same seat in&#xD;
chews and hs  ity with your person. Perhaps your neighbor&#xD;
ches nd another agreeable habits therewith connce;pr&#xD;
'haps he is a very large manan e bsheso ei nected ; per-&#xD;
a fidgaetty onean andheyou mIto a corner;" or&#xD;
hiety one and is perpetually nudging your elbow, or putting&#xD;
g     your new trowsers. You have no resource;&#xD;
you cannot even secure yourself against the annoyance by pay-&#xD;
Yet o sout  This is equality with a vengeance.&#xD;
eno doubt the rail-car, even in this po  of view, offers&#xD;
Som avanags oerthe old stage-coach. Two persons tra-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6853-00000133"/>&#xD;
veiling together occupy a whole seat, and when the car is not&#xD;
crowded they can turn a seat, and make themselves really com-&#xD;
fortable. A party of four may always establish for themselves&#xD;
this little seclusion, and there is a tacit understanding that a&#xD;
woman, especially a young woman, travelling alone, shall not&#xD;
be intruded upon unless in case of absolute necessity.&#xD;
The railroads, indeed, like our old stage-coaches, have their&#xD;
droit fdminin, or women's rights, which render our denmcatie&#xD;
equality more tolerable. The best car in the train, and the best&#xD;
placed for safety and comfort, is allotted to the ladies. In this&#xD;
car the right of a lady travelling (as American ladies of every&#xD;
rank often do) unattended, to monopolize a whole seat, or even&#xD;
two, strewing one with her reticule, bandbox and shawl, and&#xD;
spreading her crinoline over the entire width of the other, is&#xD;
usually not questioned, unless in favor of some ther lady.&#xD;
Our story has conducted us to the ladies' car of the southern&#xD;
express train of the Camden and Amboy railroad, on the after-&#xD;
noon of a day early in January, 1855. The train was rushing&#xD;
at high speed over the flat plains of New Jersey towards South&#xD;
Amboy. A young lady travelling alone-for she occupies two&#xD;
seats in the manner just described, and takes no notice of any_&#xD;
of her neighbors-first engages our attention. She is in the&#xD;
first bloom of incipient womanhood, a clear pale brunette, with&#xD;
features of exquisite regularity, among which a special bril-&#xD;
liancy was derived from a coal-black eye, the liquid darkness of&#xD;
which was shaded into tenderness by long black recurving&#xD;
lashes. If one judged by her dark gray cloth pelisse, fitting&#xD;
closely to her shape, her figure was one of perfect symmetry,&#xD;
but her countenance was so very youthful that, notwithstanding&#xD;
her apparent stature, one could not but suspect that some of&#xD;
those perfect contours were the effect of art; although her hand&#xD;
-she was reading and it was ungloved-was plump, dimpled,&#xD;
taper, with rosy nails of the celebrated filbert shape; one fan-&#xD;
cied a little coquetry in its. exposure; for one foot too, resting&#xD;
on the edge of the second seat which she had appropriated,&#xD;
discovered the same type, the high instep, the rounded, flexible&#xD;
- mould-for it was half turned. Her dress was simple; a dark&#xD;
straw bonnet and brown gauze veil; and under the pelisse a&#xD;

sian furs. Indeed, except in the article of peltry, the whole&#xD;
party were dressed in what Miss McFlimsey would consider&#xD;
below their apparent rank in life.&#xD;
The young lady who travelled alone not unfrequently bestowed&#xD;
a careless glance upon this eminently handsome young man, and&#xD;
sometimes suffered her eyes to rest, as if unconsciously, upon&#xD;
the intelligent countenance of his companion. The conversation&#xD;
of the party, which I shall necessarily translate, at last turned&#xD;
upon ler.&#xD;
"Our excessively pretty neighbor occasionally directs a&#xD;
glance this way," observed Wissen, "which is of course intended&#xD;
for you, niy dear colonel."&#xD;
"Your modesty, W issen. Mademoiselle regards you much&#xD;
more attentively than me."&#xD;
" Ah, rogue of a colonel ! The furtive glanco, just bestowed&#xD;
then instantly withdrawn, is vastly more flattering-you know&#xD;
it well-than the calm and inquisitive look which a young lady&#xD;
in her teens is not afraid to give an old soldier like myself"&#xD;
"Are you sure, gentlemen," suggested Madame, "that the&#xD;
young lady does not understand French ?"&#xD;
"Perfectly," said the handsome colonel, with a shrug.&#xD;
"I share that conviction," observed Wissen, "but pray give&#xD;
madame and me your reasons for it."&#xD;
"Her absolute unconsciousness when we are making her a&#xD;
subjectof conversation."&#xD;
"You forget, monsieur ic colonel, that the education of young&#xD;
ladies confers a command of the features which diplomats mighi&#xD;
envy."f&#xD;
"In our rank of life, perhaps, madame la comtesse.; though&#xD;
I doubt if even there I could be deceived. Certainly, however,&#xD;
this young beauty does not belong to a class (if such exists in&#xD;
this republican country) where well-bred dissimulation is carried&#xD;
to that high degree."&#xD;
The young lady's clear dark cheek became faintly flushed,&#xD;
and a smile al but imperceptible, played on her deep red and&#xD;
rather superb lips, caused doubtless, both blush and smile, by&#xD;
something she met in her book, for she never raised her eyes&#xD;
from the page.&#xD;
&#xD;
A RAILROAD ACCIDENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Upon my word, you pass a very severe criticism upon our&#xD;
lovely fellow-passenger, and one with which I can by no means&#xD;
agree," said Wissen, in a lower tone.&#xD;
"A young lady of good society in the United States-will she&#xD;
be permitted to travel all the way from Washington to New York,&#xD;
and Heaven only knows how much further, unaccompanied ?&#xD;
I hope not; for as I expect to espouse a young person of that&#xD;
class, I rather recoil from such antecedents, and their possible&#xD;
or rather inevitable consequences. I appeal to the countess."&#xD;
"Ah, you are wrong to appeal to nie," said the lady smiling.&#xD;
"The Americans are an extraordinary people, and Young Ame-&#xD;
rica, of both sexes, is not the least extraordinary part of the&#xD;
nation,"&#xD;
"Frankly'" said the handsome colonel, half unconsciously&#xD;
lowering his tone, "I take mademoiselle for the daughter of&#xD;
some petty tradesman at best, and a very careless tradesman at&#xD;
that, to send such a pretty piece of goods so far without so much&#xD;
as a shopboy to take care of it. I assure you but for the&#xD;
presence of mesdames"--bowing to the two ladies--" I should&#xD;
long ago have deemed myself justified in using what little&#xD;
English I havebpicked up at Sebastopol, in trying to mako&#xD;
mademoiselle's better acquaintance."&#xD;
"Oh, monsieur le colonel-fie !" said the countess, shaking&#xD;
her finger at the handsome     colonel.shain&#xD;
asoecolonel.&#xD;
The young lady thus spoken of, whether she understood&#xD;
trench or not, raised her eyes from the book she was so dili-&#xD;
gently reading, and gave the colonel a look peculiar to Ameri-&#xD;
cn gls, a quiet stare of astonishment. After a moment's gaze&#xD;
she turned to look out of the car window, with consummate&#xD;
tranquillity.&#xD;
"You must excuse me for saying that in that case you would&#xD;
a signal repulse," said the elder of the two gentlemen&#xD;
"Without deserving it," replied his friend. "I appeal once&#xD;
more to madame, When we first discovered our lovely young&#xD;
neighbor, whose beauty I dd not extenuate, nor her astonishing&#xD;

some brother would appear, andl her journey would probably&#xD;
terminate, she has taken her place in the omnibus, guided by&#xD;
the conductor, as I think."&#xD;
" Certainly, by the conductor," said Wissen&#xD;
" It is well. At the Philadelphe d6pot, while waiting for the&#xD;
train, mademoiselle, like ourselves, takes a cup of coffee and&#xD;
rolls, in the salle d manger, with a very good appetite'&#xD;
" Exactly, her breakfast, my lear colonel ; aid you must&#xD;
notice that in a certain modest manner she has attached herself&#xD;
to our party, as if she wished to share with Madenioiselle Ang&amp;amp;.&#xD;
lique the protection of madame," observed Wissen.&#xD;
The young lady looked more decidedly out of the window,&#xD;
and a minute after something dropped upon her book and wet it,&#xD;
" She has attached herself to us certainly ; above all, at that&#xD;
passage of a river, where there was such a crowding to et on&#xD;
the boat, and such a rush for seats in the train on this side. I&#xD;
believe that she allowed you to carry her travelling bag, colonel,&#xD;
since when behold you her sworn knight! At Philadelphe she&#xD;
has escaped me."&#xD;
"She took a carriage, which was procured for her by the con-&#xD;
ductor," said Count Wissen.&#xD;
"Very well, at all events we have found her again in this car,&#xD;
where she has taken the seat next to ours. Such a journey for&#xD;
a girl scarce eighteen and beautiful too! And you will tell me&#xD;
that she possibly belongs to the high society of the Union. My&#xD;
dear count, pardon me, but that is impossible !"-All this narra-&#xD;
tive with the greatest animation of gesture and features. The&#xD;
ladies and Wissen laughed.&#xD;
"I have been longer in this country than you," said the latter,&#xD;
with the serious manner of a foreigner in discussing a rave&#xD;
question. "I should not be surprised if our charming neighbort&#xD;
were the daughter of a senator even ; her father may live in the&#xD;
Fifth avenue,' her mother may be a leader of society in Wash-&#xD;
ington. Nay, observe her a little-for she is taking no notice of&#xD;
us, and certainly (oes not. understand French when so rapidly&#xD;
spoken :-is not her costume in perfect taste ?"&#xD;
"It is very plain," said the countess with that glance of&#xD;

268                    ROSEMARY.&#xD;
Night had fully closed in upon the bay and the mast-sur.&#xD;
rounded city, when the Amboy boat touched the pier at the&#xD;
foot of Battery Place. The beau colonel, who had not ceased to&#xD;
rally his soberer friend on his gallantry to the fair unknown:&#xD;
now called Wissen's attention to her growing nervousness.&#xD;
"Now is the time, if ever, for your knight-errantry, mom cher&#xD;
comte," said he. "Here is a distressed damsel indeed. We are&#xD;
approaching a great city, it is night-fall, and she is about to land&#xD;
without a protector. Offer your services, my brave-my life for&#xD;
it they will be accepted."&#xD;
"In spite of your ridicule, I shall do so," said Wissen.&#xD;
"Of course you will !" c"ied the colonel. "So would I if my&#xD;
position were not peculiar, and I fear to compromise it."-&#xD;
With a gay laugh.&#xD;
Wissen frankly approached the youthful traveller.&#xD;
"1 hope, mademoiselle," lie said, "that you will consider our&#xD;
day's jomne3 together a sufficient warrant for my taking the&#xD;
liberty to ask if I can be of any assistance to you in calling a&#xD;
carry-age, or otherwise."&#xD;
"You are very kind, sir. I expect friends to come for me,&#xD;
and they will have a carriage," replied the young woman, imn&#xD;
sweet voice and with a confiding smile.&#xD;
" Ali! that is all right-excuse the liberty I have taken,&#xD;
mademoiselle."o&#xD;
The wharf was covered with hackmen and porters, runners of&#xD;
hotels, and the usual mob which in New York collects around a-&#xD;
steamboat landing, with a sprinkling of pickpockets and loafers.&#xD;
The hackmen lined the wharf's edge, flourishing their whips to&#xD;
call the attention of passengers, and vociferating:--" Carriage,&#xD;
sir .-"-" Want a good carriage, sir "- They would have rushed&#xD;
upon the boat in a mass, in pursuit of their vocation, but she&#xD;
was not brought near enough for the boldest to jump, and as&#xD;
soon as the plank was laid two of the boat's officers stationed&#xD;
themselves at the gangway, and 'by oaths, threats, and violent&#xD;
pushing kept them all back and held the way clear for the exit&#xD;
of the passengers. The ladies regarded this noisy chevaux de&#xD;
frise of whips with some consternation, and clung more closely&#xD;
to their male escorts. A little incident very much diverted the&#xD;

crowd. A footman in livery, with a gilt band roud h'&#xD;
hat, and about Iifty capes, in round numbers, to his drab over-&#xD;
coat, was trying to make his way to the plank to the rat dier&#xD;
gust of the hacknen, who had a natural dislike to the reatdis-&#xD;
tative of a private carriage. John was hustled, a  repedn&#xD;
and pushed back, and finally, being an Irishman, got into a fight&#xD;
with a cab-driver who had touched him insolently wit his wip.&#xD;
Several of the cab-driver's friends set upon John; they are real&#xD;
bullies these fellows ; and the footman, though he  e al&#xD;

Count Wissen went forward decisively across the plank, with&#xD;
the young stranger, who hurried him along, saying: "Oh, sir,&#xD;
speak to the policeman."&#xD;
"You have arrested the wrong person, my friend," said the&#xD;
count.&#xD;
"That's our business," answered the blue-coat, under whose&#xD;
hands the unlucky John stood with the resignation of a martyr.&#xD;
"Move on, my lad."&#xD;
"Stop, sir!" cried the young lady, with feminine disregard of&#xD;
authority in the wrong. "You have arrested my servant, sir,&#xD;
for nothing at all."&#xD;
"I can't see it in that light, miss. If your servant gets into&#xD;
a fight here on the wharf, my duty is to arrest him."&#xD;
"Well, let him off for my sake," said the young lady. "I&#xD;
can't get home without his help."&#xD;
"Yes, miss, his carriage is just= at the corner," said a boy.&#xD;
"Take your things, miss T"&#xD;
"Want a carriage, miss ?" said a hackman, one of the fellows&#xD;
who had helped pommel John. "Take you anywhere you&#xD;
like."&#xD;
The policemen took no further notice of the young lady's&#xD;
appeal, but walked their prisoner off to the station.&#xD;
"If you wish to know who I am," she persisted, keeping&#xD;
alongside the principal officer, and leaning on the count's arm,&#xD;
"here is my card-my father's card"-taking it eagerly from&#xD;
her porte-monnaie. "My father will be accountable for the&#xD;
man,-if he is to blame."&#xD;
'-"Ah! that kind of argument will not answer in a republic !"&#xD;
said the count.&#xD;
The officer took the card sullenly ; he did not like to be&#xD;
pressed so hard by a young girl; but the gallantry of the&#xD;
M. P.s is their trait. He stopped and read it by the light of&#xD;
one of the depot lamps.&#xD;
"Behold yourself the hero of an adventure !" whispered&#xD;
aloud, in French, the handsome colonel, who with the countess,&#xD;
her daughter and maid, was close behind.&#xD;
" Hollo, Jim !" said the policeman to his companion, "look&#xD;
here, will you ?"&#xD;

my discretion, afper all; and I might impart some informations,"&#xD;
said the count.&#xD;
"It is true," replied the young vicomte. "In fact, my in-&#xD;
quiries hitherto have been wholly fruitless. No one in Wash-&#xD;
ington could tell aught of the family, but what I already knew.&#xD;
Eh! well. You remember in Algdrie, about ten years ago, a&#xD;
certain American officer of the foreign legion, about your ago,&#xD;
I should think, named d'Ashon, whom our lads called Cceur-de-&#xD;
lion on account of his excessive bravery, and because his name&#xD;
of baptism was Richard ?"&#xD;
"Do I remember him ?" replied Wissen, with emotion. "We&#xD;
were sworn brothers, my dear. He saved my life at Isly."&#xD;
" Really ! Well, it is his only daughter whom I should in the&#xD;
course of a few weeks lead to the altar, although I have not yet&#xD;
,,Y-&#xD;
seenher."&#xD;
"You interest me profoundly. Dashon has often entertained&#xD;
me on the subject of his daughter in a desert bivouac, by our&#xD;
camp fire, with the stars of Africa glittering overhead. But&#xD;
why should this marriage take place so suddenly "&#xD;
"Because my leave of absence expires-that is to say, I ac-&#xD;
cepted this special mission on condition it should not interfere&#xD;
with my rejoining our battalions in the Crimea by the first of&#xD;
March."&#xD;
"Yetyou have lost already a week in Washington !"&#xD;
"It is not lost, since I have finished my business and seen the&#xD;
capital of the Union. Besides,-to tell you the truth-I needed&#xD;
a little time to recover from the voyage before I present myself&#xD;
before a young lady who is to decide my fate. Mon Dieu, my&#xD;
dear! fabulous millions are at stake. It depends on this mar-&#xD;
riage to restore the fortunes of the Flor6al. Perhaps also I do&#xD;
not prejudice myself by a little reserve. A woman, my brave,&#xD;
- is like an angler: she likes the pleasure of hooking a shy and&#xD;
difficult fish."&#xD;
"You have not graduated in the saloons of Paris for nothing,&#xD;
after all," said the count, laughing. "Your last, diplomatically,&#xD;
is the best reason of all."i&#xD;
"For the same reason," pursued the young vicomte, with as&#xD;
much gravity as if he were planing the attack of a fortress, "I&#xD;

"I protest," said he, " that never entered my head. I am&#xD;

"Come, it is only half-past seven," said the count. "We&#xD;
can fit you out in half an hour with everything necessary. I&#xD;
will show you at the same time an establishment which has no&#xD;
compeer in Europe.'&#xD;
Greatly to his own astonishment, the young vicomte was soon&#xD;
provided with a suit of plainclothes, fitting perfectly, the more&#xD;
perfectly from the elegance of his figure, and of the best mate-&#xD;
rials known to male dress.&#xD;
"Ma foi !" he exclaimed. "I look as if I had just stepped&#xD;
out of a hotel in the Chaussde d'Antin."&#xD;
"You do, only a little more so," said his friend, in English.&#xD;
"Now you are fit to call on an American heiress, so as to pass&#xD;

"Let us finish !" said the vicomte, impatiently.&#xD;
The young men agreed to make the proposed visit in com-&#xD;
pany. Wissen assured Floidal that he would be all the more&#xD;
welcome for bringing with him a friend in the person of the&#xD;
titled Minister of a foreign court.&#xD;
"This first visit is one of ceremony after all, although it is&#xD;
informal."&#xD;
They did not call a carriage; the two nobles jumped into a&#xD;
Broadway omnibus, like any ordinary mortals; and in less than&#xD;
twenty minutes were set down precisely at Mr. Dashon's door.&#xD;
The family were not at home. Mr. and Mrs. Dashon, Miss&#xD;
Dashon and Miss Atherton, had all gone to the opera' So cards&#xD;
were duly left:-" Le Lieut. Colonel Comte de Wissen, Ministre&#xD;
de S. M. le Roi de -------;" and "Le Lieut. Colonel Vicomte de&#xD;
Florall"  The cards were all turned down in due form; the&#xD;
vicomte left two; and the name of their hotel was at the bottom&#xD;
in pencil.&#xD;
"Now that you have saved your credit, what shall we do to&#xD;
amuse ourselves .'&#xD;
" Diahle! Suppose we go to the opera too ?"  .&#xD;
"Quite the thing to do. We may see them. They may even&#xD;
condescend to see us,"&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
THE ACADEMY OF MUSIC.&#xD;
IT was a great night at the opera. In the train of one of the&#xD;
stars of the lyric firmament there had come o    nericath&#xD;
young woman of Scandinavian origin and great pronAmerica a&#xD;
who had been engaged by the famous prima donna in ordat&#xD;
sing certain contralto parts which occurred in the pe  older to&#xD;
repertoire. This young woman happened to be a genius not&#xD;
yeptappcia       Europe, where they are overwhelmed with&#xD;
reputations. The audience of the New York      -&#xD;
vned her at once for what she was, and in an instant the Sig-&#xD;
nora F~licita was hailed as the queen of the lyric stage. Her&#xD;
grand success had been in the Trovatore of Verdi  ae. er&#xD;
rmserablymefodV.r.i, a weak opera,&#xD;
miserably melodramatic, which owes its fortune t&#xD;
stikg situations and some charming melodies: above or to&#xD;
the fine part of Azucena 'On this evening was to be represented&#xD;
a much greater work, Lucrezza Borgia. The houewasresented&#xD;

&#xD;
cavaliers grouped picturesquely round him, you could scarcely&#xD;
believe it was 'a woman. The song was frantically encored ; a&#xD;
shower of bouquets and wreaths fell upon the stage. The house&#xD;
trembled with the applause. Then the music changed to the&#xD;
notes of funeral despair; Lucrezia enters to inform the revellers&#xD;
that the wine-cup has been poisoned and that they must all&#xD;
die; horror sits upon every countenance; and they pass out of&#xD;
the apartment one by one, by a door through which we behold&#xD;
their coffins standing upright  ainst the wall in readiness to&#xD;
receive them. The situation has scarcely ever been rivalled.&#xD;
There was a lady in the stage-box where the young noblemen&#xD;
saw this scene, who seemed profoundly and singularly affected&#xD;
by it. Wissen could not help noticing her emotion. it was not&#xD;
the sympathetic agitation which a tragic event usually excites&#xD;
in women, that painted itself on her countenance ; but rather,&#xD;
during the wild inspiration of Orsini's song, a glance of bitter&#xD;
contempt, such as Lucrezia herself might have bestowed upon&#xD;
her victims, and, at the moment of the catastrophe, one of irre-&#xD;
pressible triumph. She turned round to the gentleman next her&#xD;
with a smile, so peculiar, so unequivocal, and so malignant in&#xD;
its meaning, that Wissen shuddered. He felt for the moment&#xD;
that Lucrezia Borgia stood before him, as the poet has imagined&#xD;
her ;-lustful, cruel and unrelenting, and yet with a maternal&#xD;
instinct left too ; for the lady's eye, before it turned again to the&#xD;
stage, fell upon a younger companion who, from  the resem-&#xD;
blance, might well be her daughter, and the smile became affec-&#xD;
tionate. The daughter was .a very handsome girl apparently&#xD;
*      about nineteen, who wore a remarkably distinguished opera-&#xD;
cloak of cherry-color and white stripes, her hair banded with&#xD;
pearls, and her fine arms covered with bracelets. The count&#xD;
whisperingly pointed out this matron-like finery to his friend,&#xD;
and said :-" In Europe you would be sure it was a married&#xD;
woman, but I am confident that this is a young lady."-" I hope&#xD;
it is not Miss Dashon at all events !" replied the vicomte: " not&#xD;
even her beauty would reconcile me to a style like that."-&#xD;
"Elkf voild, my friend !". exclaimed Wissen.  "Look at the&#xD;
itage-box opposite ! There is our heroine of the rail-car ! And&#xD;
my faith ! she sees us too !"&#xD;
&#xD;

In fact the opposite boxws  -up&#xD;

mamma was there, in her white hair, set off by a small velvet,&#xD;

of the box nearest the stage. The two yuglde   i oehr&#xD;

vicomte has arrived this very evening, and happened into my box&#xD;
---into the den of the lioness !"&#xD;
Mrs. Varick turned full round at that and gave the strangers&#xD;
an American lady's stare. They bowed. The exciting last scenes&#xD;
of the opera, despite the absence of F6licita, now absorbed gen-&#xD;
eral attention. It is seldom that in America an opera is put&#xD;
upon the stage with any genuine dramatic effect. Nothing is&#xD;
commonly regarded but the music and the vocal gems. This&#xD;
night it was different-a great actress had infused her own con-&#xD;
ceptions into the action, and although Lucrezia was feeble com-&#xD;
pared to Orsini, the interest endured-to the last, and the audience&#xD;
never rose till the curtain fell.&#xD;
The retreat of so large an assembly was a slow and serious&#xD;
affair. Moreover, the magnates took it easily, which left time&#xD;
for greetings between friends, and display of pretty opera-&#xD;
cloaks. The parties who had occupied the two stage-boxes&#xD;
met in the vestibule. Miss Atherton and Rosemary were talking&#xD;
eagerly, the former sustaining her part in the colloquy without&#xD;
ceasing to have an eye upon everything around her. When the&#xD;
two cavaliers came in sight, she obviously said something which&#xD;
made Miss Dashon also quickly look, and Grace herself bowed.&#xD;
"We meet again very soon, mademoiselle," said the Minister,&#xD;
" in a very different scene."&#xD;
Grandmamma turned round with looks of inquiry.&#xD;
"It is the gentleman who helped Grace through the crowd in&#xD;
her difficulty with the police, grandmamma !" said Miss Dashon,&#xD;
laughing and blushing.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Dashon both thanked the count for his polite-&#xD;
ness to their guest.&#xD;
"I should have gone to the boat myself," said grandpapa,&#xD;
"but I suffer from gout"-smiling--" and I dare say my place&#xD;
was well supplied, sir."&#xD;
"Cornelius," said grandmamma, "I wish you would see if&#xD;
Johnson has got his carriage close to the steps :-your uncle&#xD;
doesn't want to walk half a square to it."&#xD;
Roosevelt went off in a rage to fulfil the commission ; the&#xD;
crowd was still dense ; for it had come on to rain ; and the car-&#xD;
riages were slow in getting up, while the pedestrians, and ladies&#xD;

closed, the footman mounted behind, Johnson gave the horses a&#xD;

"Upon my soul !" cried Flor6al. " This is an adventure !&#xD;

" Oh! my faith ! who was making love to her friend all the&#xD;
time ?-a very pretty girl too, but not to be compared to 'Meess&#xD;

"There is no disputing about tastes, my dear."-The reader.&#xD;
is to remember that the original of all this conversation is&#xD;
French. "I admire Meess Grace to excess ; but Meess Rose-&#xD;
it is simplicity itself united with a certain grandeur !"&#xD;
" Ah, bah, Wissen,! now you are in your heights. I compre-&#xD;
hend nothing of all that. In a year's acquaintance I should&#xD;
scarcely draw such a conclusion, at which you arrive after a&#xD;
quarter-of-an-hour's conversation in the lobby of an opera-house !&#xD;

"What does not concern you, my dear. What has Meess&#xD;
Grace said to you'?"&#xD;
"Absolutely nothing. It is what charms me. The inconsola-&#xD;

that nobody pronounced it.".&#xD;
"Let us pray that it may turn out to be Dashon," said the&#xD;
count, laughing.&#xD;
" Ah ! what a ravishing supposition !" cried the vicomte,&#xD;
seriously.&#xD;
"You are then really in love with this beautiful young per-&#xD;

"Perhaps: but sure I am that I have made a conquest of her;,&#xD;
and if it should turn out to be Mademoiselle Dashon,-why,&#xD;

A deep blush suffused the cheek of Rose Dashon, but Grace&#xD;

"Mademoiselle takes it coolly," observed grandmamma.&#xD;
"I knew it was he," said Rosemary.&#xD;
" That is, you suspected it, my dear child."&#xD;
"No, grandmamma-I had not a suspicion till I asked M. de&#xD;
Wissen the name of his companion, meaning to tell-"&#xD;
Rosemary stopped short, and looked down at the card of the&#xD;
handsome vicomte, who was almost her betrothed. A more&#xD;
lovely picture could not be imagined,-the eyes downcast, the&#xD;
virgin cheek slightly flushed, the ineffable expression of mo.&#xD;
desty and submission that played over her serenely beautiful&#xD;
countenance&#xD;
Her cous  Rcosevelt stifled an execration, and rushed out of&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
THE MYSTERIES A LITTLE OPENED.&#xD;
THE distinguished-looking foreigners conversion  with t&#xD;
Dashons on a footing of acquaintance in the lobby of the Aca-&#xD;
demy of Music, and handing the ladies to the carriage, attracted&#xD;
general attention, but especially that of the Varickstracte&#xD;
party coniste  f Mr and Mrs. Varick, their daughter Augusta&#xD;
and Dr. Mannikin. The latter seldom appeared in bl&#xD;
his old friends: but somehow the character of Borgia interested&#xD;
him, and  he  had  availed  him self  of  adtn i g i vtto ,i .&#xD;
plied if not expressed hmefo a standing invitation, im-&#xD;

"Beyond a.doubt it is M. de Flordal," said M  -&#xD;

Atheron the cie A sta."He did nothing but flirt with Grace&#xD;
Aeton the whole time."(rc&#xD;
suiThat rathrconfirms the supposition that it is the expected&#xD;
suito from shoace, Miss Augusta," observed Dr. Mannikin.&#xD;
"Whenlestod he devote himself to such a child as Miss&#xD;
Atherton, unless to divert attention from his real aim ?"&#xD;
Ah! you are a deep one, Mannikin! O&#xD;

" Ah, you understand etiquette !" exclaimed Mr. Varick.&#xD;
"Confound etiquette, I say. If 1 were Rose Dashon, I would&#xD;
see etiquette in Guinea before I would let my intended get too&#xD;
thick with such a confounded pretty girl as Miss Atherton.&#xD;
Doose take it! you call her chill, Isabel! She knows more&#xD;
than the other girl. I'll be hanged if she don't."&#xD;
Mr. Varick had taken between the acts what he called a&#xD;
"smile," and was in a very cheerful condition. When Dr'.&#xD;
Mannikin was set down, Mr. Varick also got out, leaving his&#xD;
wife and daughter to drive home together. The carriage then&#xD;
rolled on in silence, until Augusta exclaimed :-&#xD;
' Oh, mother ! if Rose Dashon marries a real vicomte this&#xD;
winter-the heir of a real marquis of the old faubourg, as Aunt&#xD;
Dashon says-I shall die of spite! And I see just how it will&#xD;
be: she will marry the vicomte, and Grace Atherton the count;&#xD;
or else, Rosemary will marry the count, and Grace the vicomte.&#xD;
It will be Madame la vicomtesse de Flordal, nee d'Ashon-do&#xD;
you understand ?"-mimicking her great-aunt. "I _ shall go&#xD;
mad."&#xD;
"Nee d'Ashon !" ejaculated her mother, bitterly. "Born a&#xD;
Dashon ! I was born a Dashon !"&#xD;
"Why didn't you marry Rosemary's father, and then I should&#xD;
be in her place now ?" demanded the daughter, with asperity.&#xD;
"Don't talk like a fool, Augusta."&#xD;
"Well," cried Augusta, "I don't care. I'll marry one of them&#xD;
--I don't care which-or else 1'11 run away with somebody the&#xD;
same day Rosa Dashon is married ; mind that, now&#xD;
"Just keep a little sense in your head, and you shall marry&#xD;
whom you please !" said her mother. "If you suppose that I&#xD;
am going to be out-manoeuvred this time by Aunt Dashon and&#xD;
that old Romarin, you are much mistaken. That happened&#xD;
once, Augusta. before you were born, when I had no more sense&#xD;
or experience than you have; but I have got quite another head&#xD;
on my shoulders now."&#xD;
They found Roosevelt already at the door when they arrived.&#xD;
He had that moment crossed over from his uncle Dashon's.&#xD;
"Well, Roosey," said his mother, in a kind yet fierce tone,&#xD;
"What is the news from France '?"&#xD;

The young man went in without answering. Mrs. Varick&#xD;
followed her son into the furthest room o te  s. Vrick&#xD;
threw himself upon a sofa and buried his face ite whion.&#xD;
"What has hap pvened   son ?" insisted Mrs. Varick, putting&#xD;
her arm round him with tenderness. "Tell mote "&#xD;

"Are you really my mother ?" said the young man, slowly,&#xD;
and regarding her with his great blue eyes, in which there&#xD;
gleamed an expression of yet deeper horror and despair.&#xD;
"So truly your mother, Roosevelt, that I would forfeit my&#xD;
salvation to secure your happiness."&#xD;
"Shall I be happy when 'she is out of the way,' do you&#xD;
think, mother ?&#xD;
"You will be happier, no doubt, when she is Madame do&#xD;
Florall" replied his mother, with a smile shocking to see on&#xD;
maternal lips.&#xD;
The boy broke from her arms with a cry of pain, and rushed&#xD;
out of the room. The temptress rose to her feet ; looked after&#xD;
him; moved serpent-like to the table.-" Ie will come to it at-&#xD;
last 1" she hissed rather than whispered to herself: "but it&#xD;
must be left to work."-She took up a miniature, it was with a&#xD;
trembling hand.&#xD;
Some one advanced towards her down the middle room; it&#xD;
was Dr. Mannikin. Long as their intimacy had lasted, the&#xD;
woman glanced in the mirror, smoothed her hair, straightened&#xD;
her waist, and gave her flowing skirt a slight shake, ere she&#xD;
went a step to meet him. They sate down upon the sofa where&#xD;
the scene between Mrs. Varick and Roosevelt had passed, and&#xD;
conversed long and earnestly. The physician was giving her&#xD;
some information; at times the la ly's emotion was evident;&#xD;
but we shall best explain it in our own words.&#xD;
Great events in this world are intimately connected with little&#xD;
ones. In the November election of that year there were four&#xD;
tickets run in the State, and the contest was excessively close.&#xD;
In the city, a democratic mayor was chosen, but a combination&#xD;
of Whigs and Republicans carried all the chief offices, by a&#xD;
mere plurality, except in the case of the Surrogate, who had a&#xD;
majority. Mr. George Varick, who prevusly held an office&#xD;
rich in plunder, having imprudently got himself nominated for&#xD;
one of still higher control, shared the defeat of his party and&#xD;
was left out of the city government.h11&#xD;
It was a great blow to him. From causes which we shall&#xD;
presently indicate, Mr. Varick's affairs were again in a disor-&#xD;
dered state, and he relied on the boundless contracts centering&#xD;

gether :-election expenses, bribes, law expenses, bets, interest,&#xD;
speculative losses, fast ladies, GAMBLING!! The wonder is not&#xD;
that Mr. George Varick, after robbing the public of half a rnuil-&#xD;
lion, found himself at the end of eight years worth a hundred&#xD;
thousand dollars on the wrong side of nothing; but, this leing&#xD;
the case, how lhe still had houses, horses carriages, mietresses'&#xD;
cash and credit-could still pay something, and still borrow a&#xD;
great deal.&#xD;
But he could not borrow enough for his necessities. That is&#xD;
patent to any one who knows a little of business. Mr. Varick&#xD;
owed a hundred thousand dollars more than he was worth, and&#xD;
was spending about a thousand dollars a week, with no income&#xD;
to meet that inevitable expense, and pay the interest on the float-&#xD;
ing $100,000, but-fresh loans. Let any good accountant figure&#xD;
up where he will be this time twelvemonth, allowing that he&#xD;
gets money at two per cent. a month. I shrink from the result.&#xD;
What resource has he left Whisper it. No, best not even why-&#xD;
per a fact of that nature. In a very tiuht place. waen his bra-&#xD;
ler had returned him a little note for $10,000, which he had not&#xD;
been able to get shaved even at three per cent., Mr. Varick re-&#xD;
deemed his credit on the street by meeting his obligations as&#xD;
usual, ie had got accommodated somewhere. Nay, it was at&#xD;
bank. He had borrowed the money at legal interest, of one of&#xD;
the greatest and most cautious institutions in Wall street. Mr.&#xD;
Dashon kept about half a million there on deposit, and singu-&#xD;
larly enough, though that gentleman never endorsed for any body&#xD;
(he had stepped in, it seems, to save his nephew) the note had&#xD;
the name of " C. Roosevelt Dashon," in a hand never to be mis-&#xD;
taken, on the back.&#xD;
"You couldn't be deceived in Mr. Dashon's signature '" said&#xD;
a new director, timidly, to the cashier, in the bank parlor.&#xD;
"As easily in my own," said the cashier, while the other di-&#xD;
rectors shrugged their shoulders, or raised their eye-brows, or&#xD;
grimly smiled.&#xD;
The note was passed of course.&#xD;
After that, Mr. Var  s affairs got -an upward tendency&#xD;
again; his paper became mite popular, though a few old ope-&#xD;

manded why, her cousin was moodily silent, or said in a low&#xD;
tone :-" There are reasons which I can refer speak of-to any&#xD;
one-even to you-nay, to you least of all."&#xD;
This in Rosemary's eyes was merely the avowal of a frantic&#xD;
and she thought particularly absurd jealousy ; and as she would&#xD;
not permit Cornelius to tyrannize over her, she was polite as ever&#xD;
to Dr. Mannikin, whom she found, as her sex were apt, singu-&#xD;
larly agreeable. He was a suitor like the rest, no doubt, and it&#xD;
is seldom that a girl of eighteen regards suitors with the severity&#xD;
of Penelope. Rose had an airy graciousness, not unmixed with&#xD;
humor, for all hers; but if she had a preference, it was for the&#xD;
admiration of a man mature in life, and enriched with knowl-&#xD;
edge beyond other men, -It flattered her, and if she sometimes&#xD;
regarded Dr. Mannikin with a secret fear, there was a myste-&#xD;
rious fascination also in that. Even the quaker costume was no&#xD;
disadvantage to Ezekiel; it was really better suited to a fine&#xD;
manly figure than the costume of the day ; it was more pic-&#xD;
turesque; and he turned it to the best account,.as he did most&#xD;
things.&#xD;
There was an obstacle in the way of Dr. Mannikin which most&#xD;
men in such a case would have regarded as insurmountable.&#xD;
He had a wife already, though few were aware of it. How he&#xD;
expected to remove this serious impediment, we cannot indicate;&#xD;
certainly, he had no idea of committing bigamy, least of all&#xD;
with a person so conspicuous as the heiress of Roosevelt Dashon'&#xD;
And possibly, like most persons who advance at last to the&#xD;
cQmmission of a crime, he did not exactly resolve to commit it,&#xD;
but rather played with the temptation. Just suppose that so&#xD;
immense a prize as the hand of Miss Dashon were within his&#xD;
grasp-could he resist seizing it I And in that case, what to do&#xD;
with the obstacle? i. e., the existence of a Mrs. Mannikin l&#xD;
Ezekiel pondered that question often with a little vial of blue&#xD;
liquid in his hand, the properties of which no mortal but him-&#xD;
self knew, except in the farthest East.&#xD;
It had been the study of Ezekiel's youth to discover a poison&#xD;
which could be administe~d with absolute impunity. After&#xD;
years of investigation-afte 4ravelling far-this man, still in the&#xD;
flower of his age, satisfied himself that no agent existed capable&#xD;

the first thing a woman considers, even before that of her own&#xD;
eyes, in forming an opinion of a man, Rosemary was certainly&#xD;
bound to have a very high opinion of Dr. Ezekiel Mannikin.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin, we perceive, is a personage whom it will do to&#xD;
bet on. Like Napoleon III. and the "gray-es ed man," or a cat&#xD;
crouched beside a mouse-hole, or Satan lying in wait for a sinner,&#xD;
he waited for evnts. No failures dispirited, no obstacles daunted&#xD;
him. He was careful not to mark his attentions towards Rose-&#xD;
mary herself; but he was quite frank, though he affected&#xD;
despondency with the grandparents.d&#xD;
"Beautiful creature, your grandchild, madam," he would&#xD;
observe with a sigh to Madam Dashon, as he paid his court to&#xD;
der sitting like a princess on her sofa. "Would I were ten years&#xD;
ouner (the knave should have said fifteen) that I might enter&#xD;
the lists with these young gentlemen. Heigho! it is the first&#xD;
time I ever regretted my youth."&#xD;
Or he would converse with Mr. Dashon on the corruption of&#xD;
our government, the infamous venality of our legislatures, the&#xD;
increasing load of taxation, and weave in details about taxes in&#xD;
Europe, and what the people got from their governments in&#xD;
return, the superior protection, the cheap amusements, the&#xD;
enjoyment of ithe fine arts, the admirable police, so that&#xD;
thoughtful Rosemary was sure to become a listener. Mannikinf&#xD;

identifying yourself, previous to that discovery which sooner or&#xD;

which strikes you may equally strike him. Do you understand&#xD;

"You mean that Roosey must either be married to Rose&#xD;
Dashon, or stand in her place 1"&#xD;
"There is not the slightest probability of her marrying&#xD;
Roosey now," said the physician. "Look thie thing coolly in the&#xD;

idea, Isabel."&#xD;
"If it depended on her, I should."&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin's brow knit slightly.&#xD;
"On whom    should it depend I You do not imagine, cer-&#xD;
tainly, that any earthly motive will prevent a needy Fr ench&#xD;
-noble from marrying an immense heiress, when he has the&#xD;
opportunity? Will a cat in a milk-pantry abstain ?"&#xD;
"These old families, of the faubourg are nice on the subject&#xD;
of pedigree, and Rose Dashon's shield has the suspicion of a bar&#xD;
sinister. It is her own mother, too. it she were the only&#xD;
heiress in the world, I grant you, Ezekiel. There is Grace&#xD;
Atherton, with whom Floreal (for it seems it is he) was openly&#xD;
flirting to-night, and whose race is as proud and pure, and her&#xD;
pedigree as unsullied as his; she has vast expectations ; and&#xD;
my Augusta, too-"&#xD;

Varick was brought in by two gentlemen, strangers to Mrs.Var-&#xD;
ick  He was not drunk, but senseless, with a cut on the right&#xD;
temple, which had been bleeding profusely; for his waistcoat&#xD;
and linen were dreadfully stained.                    ,,&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, madam-there is no danger whatever,"&#xD;
said one' of the gentlemen, who wore spectacles, and had the&#xD;
app"ie had better be carried upstairs at once," said his wife, who&#xD;
was alarmed for her sofas, which were yellow satin damask.&#xD;
The gentlemen looked at each other, and with a smile took up&#xD;
their burden. They were vigorous men, especially one of them,&#xD;
the taller and younger of the two. Dr. Mannikin assisted, and&#xD;
they carried Mr. Varick to his own room and laid him on the&#xD;
bed. Then the spectacled gentleman bowed slightly to Dr. Man-&#xD;
nikin, who returned it.&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin, I believe," said the stranger. "My name is&#xD;
Galenson-Dr. Galenson, at your service."&#xD;
GAh Dr. Galenson! I know you by reputation, doctor. What&#xD;
is the history of this affair, doctor '"&#xD;
" Briefly, we found this gentleman lying in the area of a house&#xD;
in       street, senseless, with this cut, which seems to have&#xD;
proceeded from a fall. From the name written in his hat we&#xD;
discovered who he was, called the first hack and brought him&#xD;
"home. The cut is not a dangerous one, madam, I assure you."&#xD;
Mr. Varic.'s face, despite his loss of blood, was deeply&#xD;
pushed, and his breathing was stertorous. Dr. Mannikin felt&#xD;
the pulse. Galenson also regarded him with more anxiety than&#xD;
his words expressed. Mrs. Varick, observing that the sight of&#xD;
blood made her faint, and turning really very pale, got a&#xD;
smelling-bottle, and threw herself on a sofa.&#xD;
"He had taken laudanum," whispered Galenson. "We took&#xD;
him to a druggist's first, and did everything necessary.&#xD;
Mrs. Varick fainted entirely away. This caused great confu-&#xD;
sion. Dr. Mannikin, who knew the ropes, called Miss Augusta,&#xD;
who came rushing in in her night-clothes, and retreated with a&#xD;
shriek on seeing so many gentlemen. Roosevelt entered, an&#xD;
was self-possessed as possible. Here was another recognition;&#xD;

"HERE is one of the advantages of the artificial system of&#xD;
government established in this mighty Republic," said the&#xD;
count, laughing. "I came to this the real capital, to investi-&#xD;
gate some questions of great importance to my country, and&#xD;
behold I must return to-morrow to Washington to conduct a&#xD;
negotiation of little moment with the American cabinet. I&#xD;
regret it very much on your account, my dear F'ordal, as I&#xD;
shall be detained there several weeks; and before I return&#xD;
your destiny will be decided ; you will have been married&#xD;
perhaps; will even have set sail for France with your bride."&#xD;
"Perhaps not," said the young vicomte. "I have a presenti-&#xD;
ment that this affair will not succeed well, and that I shall re-&#xD;
turn without any bride."&#xD;
"you have presentiments ! A sure sign that you are in love.&#xD;
But suppose Meess Grace and Mile. Dashon turn out one and the&#xD;
same person 1"&#xD;
"You who understand English so well, should have acquired&#xD;
some definite ideas respecting her."&#xD;
"My faith ! The old gentleman made his acknowledgments&#xD;
to me in what he supposed to be French, and may, the good'&#xD;
liable fly away with me, if I understood two consecutive words&#xD;
of what he said ! But he certainly used the words 'my grand-&#xD;
daughter' several times, and ended by saying in plain English&#xD;
that his granddaughter would thank me better than he could.&#xD;

"Am I well enough ?" demanded Flordal, who was in full.&#xD;

"Superb, my friend ! Even the kepi becomes you !"&#xD;
"You observe that it is our campaigning order-kepi, red&#xD;

The vicomte changed color as he read.&#xD;
"Anonymous ! cowardly ! infamous !" escaped him.   le&#xD;
crushed the epistle and was about to fling it into the fire: Wis-&#xD;

"Is it an anonymous letter ? Then preserve it. It may here-&#xD;

" Read it !" said Flordal contemptuously.&#xD;

co dly.&#xD;
"I will," said the young vicomte, folding up the anonymous&#xD;
letter, and putting it into his breast-pocket.&#xD;
The young men descended to their carriage in silence. On&#xD;
the way, Flordal merely broke out once, saying:&#xD;
"By my faith ! I suspect that little hunchback who regarded&#xD;
me with such a furious air last night, while I gave the arm to&#xD;
Mademoiselle Grace !"&#xD;
"You will have rivals, do not doubt it," replied Wissen, pithily.&#xD;
A quarter of an hour brought them to the end of the line of&#xD;
carriages formed to reach Mr. Dashon's door. The first aspect&#xD;
of the house was strikingly palatial. The lower windows on the&#xD;
Avenue were close-shuttered, but those down the garden front&#xD;
were bright with the illumination within, and the double range&#xD;
of the great front saloon showed each an eye of light between&#xD;
its heavy draperies, but not enough to overcome the intense&#xD;
brightness of two enormous private street-lamps which threw a&#xD;
flood of light upon the rusticated rez-de-chaussde and the col-&#xD;
umned windows of the facade, copied in brown stone from one&#xD;
of the superb gables of the Louvre. Two carriages unloaded at&#xD;
once ; from each a velvet carpet extended to one flight of the&#xD;
double steps, and so to the vestibule. Policemen kept the way&#xD;
clear.&#xD;
"These d'Ashon are great people after all," said Col. de&#xD;
Floral.&#xD;
"The first door to the right, gentlemen," said a personage in&#xD;
white kids, as they entered,&#xD;
The gentlemen's cloak-room, in fact, was the library, where,&#xD;
by an ingenious idea of grandmamma Dashon's, the unoccupied&#xD;
shelves (usually concealed by rich panelling) were fitted up&#xD;
with compartments for over-garments, for which each guest&#xD;
received a ticket. A large double rack, with two hundred peus,&#xD;
accommodated the hats. Quiet and respectful colored gentlemen&#xD;
presided over this important department.&#xD;
A knot of irresistible youngsters, each of whom believed he&#xD;
was sure to marry Miss Dashon, Were adjusting their curls and&#xD;
&#xD;
neck-ties before a swing-glass; at the mantel-&#xD;
elderly gentlemen drew on carefully their spotless mlo, se&#xD;

Brooks's, and in one corner a marble slab  tha&#xD;
glassesThlabwithdecanters and&#xD;

with a diamond cross on the breast of his coat, made a con-&#xD;
siderable sensation.&#xD;
"This is worth seeing after all, for it -&#xD;
Wissen. "Observe that tall youth, who is -inatimsl, for&#xD;

ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The count and    real were not greatly surprised to see their&#xD;
opera grandma, ma of the preceding night. The handsome&#xD;
Minister advanced to bow and take her cordially offered hand,&#xD;
and then presented his friend as if it had been a court. Grand-&#xD;
mamma adressed a few words of stately welcome to the young&#xD;
vicomte, in excellent French, with a decided accent, and then&#xD;
said :-" 1 must present you to my granddaughter, M. le vi-&#xD;
conte ; and you, M. le ministre, to Miss Atherton."&#xD;
Witn that grandmiamrna turned towards two young ladies&#xD;
dressed exactly alike-two angels in tulle and roses (but&#xD;
whether it was .a rose skirt, bouillonde, with a white tunic, or&#xD;
vice-versa, and whether the skirt was over the tunic or the tunic&#xD;
over the skirt, and in fine,  ' bich was which, and which wasn't&#xD;
which, and why the roses were red that looped the white tunics,&#xD;
and white-a creamy velvety yellow--that crowned the dark&#xD;
hair, I cannot tell, except that the effect was as if they two had&#xD;
just bloomed in a garden)-and grandinamma said :-" I need&#xD;
hardly introduce M. le comte de Wissen, and the colonel vicomte&#xD;
de Flor6al, young ladies. Jifessieurs-my granddaughter and&#xD;
her friend, Miss Atherton."&#xD;
And both young ladies simultaneously bowed.&#xD;
There was so much general resemblance between them, both&#xD;
having dark eyes and hair, clear-dark complexions aid clas-&#xD;
sic features, an equal height, and elegance of figure, that with&#xD;
the identity of dress, one might have been, and frequently was,&#xD;
mistaken for the other. All through the evening, those, who&#xD;
had never seen Grace, and but slightly knew Rosemary, kept&#xD;
speakin4o the former as "Miss Dashon."     As for the for-&#xD;
eigners they were as much perplexed with the identity of the&#xD;
two young ladies as I am about their skirts and tunics-which&#xD;
was which ; or rather they were totally and unconsciously de-&#xD;
ceived. Had they conversed in Engdsh the error would have&#xD;
instanly rectified, from the necessity of addressing  ach by name;&#xD;
but as they talked entirely in French out of politeness to Col. tie&#xD;
Floral, that eminently convenient word mademoiselle left the&#xD;
mistake unsuspected. Moreover Flordal was far from cool, and&#xD;
even Wissen'permitted himself to become excited by this reali-&#xD;
zation of their ideas, and the prospective felicity of his friend.&#xD;

America remarked): his hand trembled, though it held fast to&#xD;
the buttons of his waistcoat ; and as soon as he had paid his&#xD;
respects to his aunt and "Cousin Rose," he went slowly upstairs&#xD;
to join a card party. His wife and daughter were soon twirling&#xD;
and dashing along in the schottische, as if nothing in the world&#xD;
had happened or was likely to happen; and his son Roosevelt,&#xD;
who had arrived among the earliest, went prowling about the&#xD;
rooms, speaking to no one, dancing with nobody, and keeping&#xD;
his cousin Rose always in sight. Once he approached her.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you do not dance with the Frenchman,"&#xD;
said he, savagely.&#xD;
"Indeed, Roosey, I kept the first quadrille open for him, but&#xD;
he did not ask me," said Rosemary, smiling ; "and as I am&#xD;
engaged every set till supper, and do not polk with gentlemen,,&#xD;
I cannot dance with Col. de Flordal till after that grand event&#xD;
comes off."&#xD;
" Then you will ?"&#xD;
"Of course."'&#xD;
"Beware, Rose 1" said Roosevelt, with a bitter smile, and left&#xD;
her.&#xD;
Although Rosemary did not " polk with gentlemen," she did&#xD;
with girls. Grace and she were on the floor half the time to-&#xD;
gether--the most provokingly charming sight in the world.&#xD;
"I believe," whispered she, "that if you and I were not&#xD;
exempt from anxiety on that score, this would be the true way&#xD;
to get husbands-wouldn't it, Grace '&#xD;
A bright permanent flush sat on Miss Grace Atherton's clear&#xD;
olive cheek; she hardly raised her eyeo those of her friend.&#xD;
If Floral passed-for he was a great waltzer-the flush deep-&#xD;
ened to a bright red spot, and the respiration quickened ; above&#xD;
all, when his partner was Mrs. George Varick, whose style of&#xD;
dress Grace sharply criticized. Rose said-" It is none of our&#xD;
bus'ness, Grace dear 1"&#xD;
"Well," said Grace, "if I were you I would rather polk with&#xD;
Col. de Flordal myself, than let him polk with her."&#xD;
"Fie !" said Rose. "if I would with anybody, he is the last&#xD;
man in the world !"&#xD;

GRANDMAMMA'S BALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I was hardly dressed this evening when some one tapped at&#xD;
my door. I opened it myself, and lo! there was Black Jim&#xD;
with a cup of coffee and a tiny glass of cognac-for MEn!-do&#xD;
you understand ?"-playfully mimicking grandmamma's grand&#xD;
air.&#xD;
"You took it 'I" asks the Minister.&#xD;
"I did, monsieur, and le roi Jacques has promised always to&#xD;
bring me such a little cup when occasion serves."&#xD;
"Black Jim is very attentive to you, cousin Rose-with a&#xD;
king at your feet, you ought to be quite indifferent, as I see&#xD;
you are, to counts and marquises!' said a lady sitting at the&#xD;
same table.&#xD;
Wissen turned at the voice, and saw Lucretia Borgia, whom&#xD;
a gentleman in semi-quaker costume was helping to oysters.&#xD;
Wissen did not understand the allusion, although a glance or&#xD;
Mrs. Varick's eye, directed towards Flordal, who was seated by&#xD;
Miss Grace and assiduously helping her, partly explained it.&#xD;
"How completely devoted is my friend Flordal to Meess&#xD;
Grace !" observed the Minister to his beautiful neighbor.&#xD;
"She is a mere child," said Rosemary, with perfect serenity.&#xD;
"I am delighted that Col. de Flordal entertains her so agreeably."&#xD;
The count slightly stared.&#xD;
"Certainly," said he, "it must be the wish of all his friends&#xD;
that he may succeed in gaining her good gi aces."&#xD;
It was now Rosemary's turn to stare. Sbe had not an idea&#xD;
of the error of the two foreigners; but now a glow more sudden&#xD;
and more lovely than the first blush of the aurora overspread&#xD;
her brow, face, neck, and bosom.&#xD;
She rose as suddenly; stepped like a nymph behind four or&#xD;
five people seated next her on the divan, and quickly round the&#xD;
table to Grace's side, and whispered in her ear. Miss Atherton&#xD;
started up with a look of confusion, and appeared about to yield&#xD;
her seat to her friend, but Rosemary half forcibly, half caress-&#xD;
ingly pushed her back, whispered again earnestly, and returned&#xD;
to her own place with the same graceful courage.&#xD;
"I am very hungry," said she, as she resumed, laughing. and&#xD;
slightly panting, her seat. "Except Jim's coffee and thimble-&#xD;
full of cognac, I have not tasted anything this evening."&#xD;
&#xD;
So then, her emotion, whatever its cause, had not taken away&#xD;
her appetite. Wissen wondered at her, and str ore way&#xD;
after despatching a slice of grouse, she turned to himore, said,&#xD;
with a blush--in Englishm..a&#xD;
"Do not you think that my friend Miss Grace Atherton has a&#xD;

manner. "I have then the honor of speaking to Miss Dashon ?"&#xD;
Are we so much alike that you cannot tell one from the&#xD;
other? or is that a delicate compliment to me ?"&#xD;
" J have been laboring under a mistake from the first," said&#xD;
the lIinister. "My friend, also, I regret to say, has the same&#xD;
misconception"&#xD;
"It is a little comedy !" said Rosemary, with a musical laugh.&#xD;
"It is no matter, however, as Miss Athert  - a  a  ah.&#xD;
I engage you, M. le comte, not to interrupt it on an  hcoes."&#xD;

GRANDMAMMA'S BALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
till grandmamma moved. Then a little confusion arose in the&#xD;
ball; it was only a young man who had got a little too much&#xD;
champagne; the corks were flying in all directions; people&#xD;
were leaving the supper-room, others coming in rapidly to take&#xD;
their places ; some gentlemen, old and young, rather excited at&#xD;
the novelty of a sit-down supper at a party, were inclined to&#xD;
prolong the session too much ; a very happy individual gave a&#xD;
toast, and wanted to get upon the table to make a Union-saving&#xD;
speech ; he was with some difficulty prevented, with gentle vio-&#xD;
lence was got away and put into a carriage. It was amusing to&#xD;
see the astonishment of Flordal at this occurrence. The barbarism&#xD;
which American, like Russian, magnificence too often thinly&#xD;
veils, peeped out a little. The ladies retired from that part of&#xD;
the hall in dismay, but those who had not yet supped were not&#xD;
prevented by it from sitting down at other tables. In the mean-&#xD;
time, before Wissen could escape from his fair prison, Floreal&#xD;
and -Miss Atherton, rising, quitted the room together ; and as&#xD;
soon as he got out, grandmamma, whom he had had the honor of&#xD;
leading to supper, resumed his arm.&#xD;
"Resign yourself, count," said Rosemary, as she swept by&#xD;
him on the arm of her last partner. She was on her way to join&#xD;
the first quadrille after supper, in which she was engaged to&#xD;
dance with Col. de Flordal, with whom except when he did&#xD;
her the honor of asking that favor, she had not exchanged a&#xD;
single word all the evening. In fact, Miss Dashon had adopted&#xD;
the general rule of not talking to young gentlemen, except in&#xD;
monosyllables._&#xD;
Her cavalier was a shy and silent young man ; at supper to&#xD;
which he wasrentitledbto conductmher, e had not favored her&#xD;
with a single remark, but he was more lively now and made a&#xD;
number of silly observations as they went upstairs, at all which&#xD;
Miss Dashon was good-natured enough to laugh, so that he&#xD;
flattered himself he was entertaining her vastly. She hurried&#xD;
him along,-it was surprising how quick and free she could step&#xD;
off when she chose--and in crowded saloon and door-way every-&#xD;
body yielded to the beautiful daughter of the house, distin-&#xD;
guished by her exquisite carriage and peculiar toilette (for her&#xD;
dress was then a novelty). Rawkin was delighted with her con-f&#xD;
&#xD;
313&#xD;
&#xD;
descension, for she took him through all the rooms of the ground&#xD;
floor-leaving h m at the door of the ladies' apartments while&#xD;
she peeped in ;-through all those of the grand suite. Nowhere&#xD;
were- Flordal and Miss Atherton to be found ! Finally  she&#xD;
resolved to return to the great saloon (where they were waltz-&#xD;
ing) and order the next quadrille to be played- Then Col, do&#xD;
Flordal must appear to keel) his engagemeret.&#xD;
In the hall she encountered Roosevelt Varick, who approached&#xD;
her with agitation.&#xD;
" Rosemary ! I have been looking for you everywhere. Come&#xD;
with me. Uncle wants you."   ne&#xD;
"Grandpa wants me'? Excuse me, Mr. Rawkin Where is&#xD;
he, Roosey '?",                          aere&#xD;
"Down stairs."&#xD;
Mr. Dashon was in the lower hall, at the entrance of the&#xD;
little anteroom. With him were Mr. George Varick, and a&#xD;
couple of getle*m.eore                       arcknad'&#xD;
coupe lo lkenlemen im great coats, with hats in haud, who did&#xD;
not look like guests.&#xD;
"My dear child," said grandpapa,"I want the key of your&#xD;
room, and permission to see these gentlemen there. There is&#xD;
not another spot in the house where we can be free from in-&#xD;
trusion."&#xD;
"Certainly) grandpapa."&#xD;
She led on through the ante-chamber (hall room) into the&#xD;
small conservatoryr   h      -       ro.&#xD;
To Rosemary's infinite astonishment, there were the vicomte&#xD;
and Grace in confidential converse-the young vicomte held&#xD;
Grace's hand. Grace seemed excessively confused.&#xD;
"I am sorry to have disturbed you," said Rosemary, coldly..&#xD;
"Grand papa wanted to go to my room with these gentlemen."&#xD;
Miss Atherton and the vicomte withdrew, while Miss Dasho&#xD;
took her key from behind a flower-pot, and opened hr door.&#xD;
"Let me go in first, grandpapa, and see if all is in order, and&#xD;
turn_ up the gas."&#xD;
"Oh, never mind, my child-never mind-we will make every&#xD;
excuse on such a night," said grandpapa, entering.&#xD;
Mr. George Varick, the two strangers, and Roosevelt followed&#xD;

down in readiness to receive its occupant; across. a chair lay a&#xD;
bright dressing-robe, on the table stood an emity coffee-cup--&#xD;
the same which Black Jim so attentively brought before the&#xD;
party began.&#xD;
Rosemary's heart was all in a flutter from a thousand emotions,&#xD;
and lo! Mr. George Varick dropping on his knees at her tale,&#xD;
on which he bu ied his head, cried out in a horrible voice-&#xD;
"I confess all! Mr. Dashon ! I have forged your name--&#xD;
that's the whole truth-but it is a trifle-a trifle to you-save&#xD;
me for my children's sake ! !'F&#xD;
Aghast, Rosemary leaned back against the door of her an-&#xD;
tique wardrobe.&#xD;
"Leave us, my child !" said her grandfather, sternly.&#xD;
"Don't go, Rose ! for Heaven's sake F' whispered Roosevelt,&#xD;
-grasping her hand convulsively. "Intercede for my father--&#xD;
for us all !"&#xD;
Rosemary locked her door on the inside, and went round to&#xD;
her grandfather, who bad sat down, seated herself in his lap,&#xD;
and threw her arms round his neck.-                  -&#xD;
"This can be hushed up, Mr. Dashon," 'said one of the&#xD;
strange gentlemen, also seating himself, "if you are willing to&#xD;
pay the very heavy amount in which Mr. Varick has defrauded&#xD;
our bank,"&#xD;
Rosemary whispered in her grandfather's ear.&#xD;
"You are a fool, child ! He will do it again !"&#xD;
"Never !" groaned Varick. "Save the honor Qf my name,&#xD;
my children-your own blood, Mr. Dashon-.and to-morrow I&#xD;
will be past committing such an offence again !'&#xD;
"Miserable man ! would you commit suicide "&#xD;
"He attempted it last night, and was only saved by accident&#xD;
and the skill of Dr. Mannikin, sir !" said Roosevelt, with won-&#xD;
derful calmness.   -&#xD;

&#xD;
"lHe will be very careful how he does it, if I get him out of&#xD;
this scrape now," said Mr. Dashon, with a look of scorn, every&#xD;
fibre of his frame trembling with anger.&#xD;
Rosemary's arms tightened round her ;grandfather's neck, as&#xD;
she spoke in passionate whispers. 'Twas a strange contrast--&#xD;
her young face, her liquid, melting, entreating eye, her mouth&#xD;
of inexpressible tenderness-the old man's dark, stern, unre-&#xD;
laxing countenance, hard as wood, only the eye showing emo-&#xD;
tion, and that terrible.&#xD;
"Not for their sakes-but for mine, then, grandpapa !--&#xD;
This shame will fall on me, too. Have I not enough already to&#xD;
bear for the faults and crimes of the Varicks !" exclaimed she&#xD;
loftily, and rising to her feet.&#xD;
Roosevelt covered his face with both his hands. His uncle&#xD;
looked at him, with a stony eye.&#xD;
"Do you love this boy, Rose ?"&#xD;
"This is not a place for such-a question, sir !" said the girl,&#xD;
crimsoning.&#xD;
"I must have an answer-on your veracity," said the old&#xD;
man, obdurately.&#xD;
"I love Roosevelt as a cousin--in no other way, sir, do I or&#xD;
can I ever regard him."&#xD;
The young man uttered a faint cry-quickly suppressed.&#xD;
"My curse on you, Rose, if you deceive me, or if you ever&#xD;
marry him. Marry any one else you like--the Frenchman if&#xD;
you fancy him-no one named Varick !"&#xD;
"I am entirely disposed to obey you in that, sir," said Rose-&#xD;
mary, again drawing close to him, and sinking down at his knee.&#xD;
"Give me the notes !" said grandpapa, hoarsely, to the gen-.&#xD;
tieman who had before spoken.&#xD;
With great eagerness, the bank officer took them froni a&#xD;
pocket-book'in the breast of his coat, and laid them on the table&#xD;
before Mr. Dashon. The latter examined them one by one and&#xD;
set down the amounts, which he cast up. He then glanced at&#xD;
the endorsements--a red angry spot burned in his cheek as if it&#xD;
had been suddenly smitten. Varick never raised his head. Mr.&#xD;
Dashon gathered up the notes, and said bitterly-.&#xD;
"These would never have been passed without the connivance&#xD;

He gave them to Rosemary, who instantly put them into the&#xD;

Romeo and .uliet.&#xD;
FROM THE VICOMTE DE FLOREAL TO COUNT WISSEN.&#xD;
"NEARLY a month has elapsed, my friend, since you left&#xD;
me ; yet I have not written except the few lines which all&#xD;
simply announced to you that my marriage was settled. How&#xD;
this grand result became in so short a time an accomplished&#xD;
fact, I shall apprise you in few words. You have not forgotten&#xD;
that Madame Dashon had the exquisite attention for you to&#xD;
cause your national waltz to be played after supper, nor what&#xD;
a prodigious sensation you made in waltzing with that extremely&#xD;
undressed and bediamonded Madame Varick, the cousin of&#xD;
my beautiful betrothed. You will also recollect how the&#xD;
daughter of Mme. Varick-the same into whose box we&#xD;
intruded at the opera-waltzed with a certain Deuxtemps, fine&#xD;
waltzer all the same, and how upon that Mlle. Dashon super-&#xD;
vened with a message in the ear of your brilliant partner,&#xD;
which caused her to retire precipitately from the ball. My&#xD;
faith ! you will agree with me that mademoiselle shone out on&#xD;
that occasion with a quite particular lustre. How, to prevent&#xD;
any interruption to the flow of the festivity, she offered in smil-&#xD;
ing her hand to you in lieu of the partner of whom her quite&#xD;
mysterious whisper had deprived you! What an exquisite&#xD;
effect was that which was praised and almost applauded by all&#xD;
the world, of the pretty rose and white robes of the sister-like&#xD;
beauties chasing each other in endless revolution round the&#xD;
parqueted floor of that beau salon, conducted by us foreign&#xD;
heroes ! But you know not the real heroism of Mlle. Dashon&#xD;

that night-a behavior which has obtained for her my profound&#xD;
admiration and esteem. Certes, I shall possess, besides a fabu-&#xD;
lous fortune, the most estimable wife in the world, of a beauty&#xD;
no less to dazzle the senses of any man.&#xD;
"It was after our waltz that I availed myself of the custom&#xD;
which I found universal, to invite mademoiselle to a prom-&#xD;
enade through the handsome rooms. I immediately seized the&#xD;
opportunity to exonerate the adorable Grace.-' Enough!' she&#xD;
exclaims at the-first word. 'My friend has told me that she&#xD;
is not to blame-you cannot add to that assurance !'-Then I&#xD;
lay myself at her feet to fulfil the engagements made between&#xD;
her grandfather Romarin and my family. You can never&#xD;
divine her response.&#xD;
" ' These errors of comedy,' says the beautiful one, turning&#xD;
to me, and pulling to pieces a flower-' affect not the serious&#xD;
duties of life: there are tragic scenes which influence our des-&#xD;
tiny quite otherwise and which impose a devoir. Near rela-&#xD;
tion of mine, M. le vicomte, has just been detected in a crime.&#xD;
True, it is not known beyond four or five persons, all interested&#xD;
in preserving the secret. Heaven knows when he will commit&#xD;
another, or what accident will reveal this. You ought to&#xD;
know it.'&#xD;
"Imagine my answer. Unfortunately few families are stain-&#xD;
less in that regard. The poor duc de Praslin was my relative.&#xD;
In short, I put aside that objection as irrelevant. My vanity&#xD;
does not conceal from me that she was not overjoyed at my&#xD;
persistance. We were in a room, the last of the suite, where&#xD;
hung two portraits of sufficient merit as works of art.-' They&#xD;
are my father and mother,' said she, with a virgin blush.&#xD;
'Know you the circumstances of their marriage and of my&#xD;
birth V &#xD;
" I showed her the anonymous letter, which proved that I&#xD;
was sufficiently well-informed.  That knowledge was now-a&#xD;
merit in her eyes. I confess I was humiliated to find her so&#xD;
much superior to my idea. In reading the letterfhe blushed&#xD;
indignantly, and returned it, saying-' Well, monsi it i all&#xD;
literally true !'-' True !' exclaimed I.-' And insini'  an in-&#xD;
famous falsehood!' added she.-' I will ask an expi  on of&#xD;

your grand-parents,' responded I, wishing to spare a young&#xD;
girl the necessity of approaching such a subject.-' I am not&#xD;
such a child, M. le colonel,' she replied, with spirit, 'that I&#xD;
cannot answer a plain question about the honor of my mother.&#xD;
To me that is as simple and as holy as the sunlight shining into&#xD;
a church and falling on a tombstone, even with the pavement,&#xD;
where rich and poor tread, and know not that a saint lies there&#xD;
beneath. I know what I am at this moment ; and such as I&#xD;
am, my mother was, M. le vicomte, when she received the nup-&#xD;
tial benediction.'-This was pronounced with an inconceivable&#xD;
air of virtuous pride, to which filial piety added a certain ten-&#xD;
derness.-' I believe it, mademoiselle,' replied I, falling at her&#xD;
feet, 'as I believe the credo.'-She disengaged herself from me,&#xD;
with a cheek redder than the roses on her bosom ; said-' Write,&#xD;
to-morrow;' and fled. To-morrow I wrote, and punctually&#xD;
received the following reply, on which I have meditated ever&#xD;
since&#xD;
"'M. LE COLONEL VIcoMT,' (very formal, is it not?)&#xD;
' 'Grandpapa tells me that I should answer your very flat-&#xD;
tering proposal in my own name. It was my duty to apprise&#xD;
you of circumstances which might affect your resolution; that&#xD;
done, the choice of my parents is for me the will of Providence.&#xD;
That you have been similarly inspired does not fail to diminish&#xD;
the apprehensions which I cannot deny I have felt, lest I should&#xD;
be unable to make you happy, M. le vicomte. I have one favor-&#xD;
to ask. As the time is so short, and my preparations must be&#xD;
hurried, will you allow me to pass the intervening period in&#xD;
retirement.&#xD;
"'ROSE MARIE.'&#xD;
"Behold a very singular acceptance, which is neither French&#xD;
nor yet American, as you have explained to me the American&#xD;
mode of arranging these affairs. In effect, the letter to which&#xD;
the above is the response, was full of ardor and respect; the&#xD;
sole point to which she alludes is one where I represented my-&#xD;
self as guided by Heaven to the distant land where I was to&#xD;
find so great a treasure as herself. You will agree that if I'had&#xD;

&#xD;
flattered myself with the hope of making a conquest of my fu-&#xD;
ture bride, I have signally failed.&#xD;
"In fine, during the three weeks which have already elapsed,&#xD;
I have scarcely seen Mademoiselle Dashon, and then only in tho&#xD;
presence of her family. Of this, as a Frenchman, I have no&#xD;
right to complain, although I learn that the custom of the coun-&#xD;
try is very different. I ought in fact to rejoice that the manners&#xD;
of my bride are those of a young French girl of rank perfectly&#xD;
well brought up. She is more frank and independent, it is true;&#xD;
but not less reserved. Once when I called (which I do daily) I&#xD;
found her alone. Now I am told that an American girl, in&#xD;
those circumstances, would sit an hour or so with her accepted&#xD;
lover, and even permit him many innocent liberties at the bare&#xD;
thought of which I tremble ; but Mlle. Rose Marie starts up in&#xD;
confusion, drops a curtsey of the most profound, says she will&#xD;
call grandmamma, vanishes. As Madame Dashon was out shop-&#xD;
ping, I received presently a message to that effect by a pretty&#xD;
maid-servant, but no more mademoiselle that day.&#xD;
"At present it wants but a -week to our nuptials. Mademoi-&#xD;
selle is in retreat. I shall not see her again till we meet at&#xD;
the altar. The ceremony has been deferred till the latest&#xD;
moment: at nine o'clock the nuptial benediction ; at half-past&#xD;
nine a grand reception which will last two hours ; at noon&#xD;
we embark on the Havre steamer. As I am a miserable sailor,&#xD;
I devote the first fortnight of the 'honeymoon' (as the Ameri'&#xD;
cans call it) to sea-sickness. Scarcely shall I have time to&#xD;
place my bride in the Hotel Flordal, before I must set out for&#xD;
the Crimea.&#xD;
"The Dashons-grandpapa and grandmamma-accompany .&#xD;
us to Europe. Without that, Mme. de Flordal would find her&#xD;
first year of marriage too horribly dreary-her husband at&#xD;
Sebastopol under the Russian batteries-her maternal grand-&#xD;
father exposed to the same dangers-not a friend near her but&#xD;
my family, who are yet total strangers.&#xD;
"I must not forget to mention that by a special permission&#xD;
the marriage will take place at Mr. Dashon's house, and that it&#xD;
will be blesges by Monseigneur de New York himself. This is&#xD;
done to please the Dashons, and accommodate the: gout of&#xD;
&#xD;
grandpapa, which, between ourselves, is an excuse always&#xD;
ready for everything. The arrangement does not please&#xD;
mademoiselle, who pleaded hard to be married in church, but&#xD;
yielded the point when she found how much the old people&#xD;
were set against it. To satisfy her, a beautiful altar is pre-&#xD;
pared, and there will be every ceremony except the nuptial&#xD;
Mass, which Monseigneur will not permit unless we present our-&#xD;
selves in church for it. Hence mademoiselle goes to commu-&#xD;
nion at the convent the same morning; and I, reprobate as you&#xD;
think me, remembering that I am a Flordal, a Frenchman and&#xD;
a Catholic, shall religiously fulfil all the duties of the occasion&#xD;
at the church of the Jesuits.&#xD;
"I trust to see you. My friend, you cannot tell how my&#xD;
heart misgives me. I adore my bride ; she is only a trifle too&#xD;
dazzling and too perfect .for such a sinner as I. Then Miss&#xD;
Grace is 'bride-maid'-sole bride-maid-to the great disgust&#xD;
of numerous Mesdemoiselles Varick who pretend a nearer&#xD;
claim. With infinite reluctance I have acceded to a request&#xD;
of Miss Dashon, and have invited that little Monsieur Varick,&#xD;
her cousin, to act as 'groom-man,' in the absence of any rela-&#xD;
tive or personal friend of my own. I wished for you, my friend,&#xD;
but the uncertainty of your coming on, and the doubt whether&#xD;
diplomatic etiquette would permit you to accept, prevented my&#xD;
speaking of it. I always suspected the little monsieur of writ-&#xD;
ing the anonymous letter; that he loves his cousin to the point&#xD;
of desperation I am certain ; and I think it is a cruelly mis-&#xD;
taken kindness on her part to assign him thus the office, as&#xD;
it were, of his own executioner. Then I tremble at the thought&#xD;
of Miss Grace ! That beautiful child-is she not just fifteen 2&#xD;
--has many defects by the side of the .perfect Rose: for that&#xD;
reason even, she captivates my somewhat human sympathies&#xD;
more. Heaven knows if ever I had a pure feeling in my heft&#xD;
for one of her sex, it was .for her: I would not care to marry&#xD;
her (were I free) for these four or five years; my bachelor&#xD;
life does not begin to weary me yet : but how I let my pen run&#xD;
on! One would say I was a girl of eighteen and not a bearded&#xD;
soldier, who has seen battles and shed blood !&#xD;

GRANDPAPA' S SEVENTY.&#xD;
&#xD;
What grandmamma Dashon never could understand, or find&#xD;
anybody else to understand, was why her husband, hitherto&#xD;
simply resigned to the French marriage, became all at once the&#xD;
most zealous for it of all the family. Grandmamma thought it&#xD;
was very well, very well, indeed, considering the military rather&#xD;
than the hereditary rank of the jeune vicomte-do you under-&#xD;
stand ? and his fine personal qualifications, such as beauty,&#xD;
manners, talent even, which she admitted might in some degree&#xD;
contribute to the happiness even of a marquise. But grand-&#xD;
papa, who appreciated all these qualities very highly, too highly,&#xD;
and cared not a straw for a coronet, had always considered the&#xD;
poverty of the Flordals a great objection. Wealth likes to&#xD;
match with wealth, and the millionaire could not but regard&#xD;
the grand marquis on four hundred a-year, as greatly inferior&#xD;
to himself whose rental was easily figured at as many hundred&#xD;
thousands. Mrs. Dashon was not so much surprised at grand-&#xD;
papa's proposing rather than adopting the plan of accompanying&#xD;
the young couple to France, and' of amusing their grand-&#xD;
daughter during her husband's absence with a little tour. Their&#xD;
hearts were both too utterly bound up in her, to make that at&#xD;
all strange-it was inevitable. How could they leave her alone&#xD;
among strangers ? What desolation that would be to a bride&#xD;
of eighteen, who had never been from home, except to reside&#xD;
in a convent !&#xD;
Grandpapa had reasons of his own, however, which he did&#xD;
not communicate to grandmamma. He had no faith in the&#xD;
reformation of George Varick, Esq.; and so far as the future&#xD;
use of his own name was concerned, from which he was certain&#xD;
nothing but the impossibility of using it would deter him in&#xD;
any place of difficulty, that impossibility could scarcely exist&#xD;
unless Mr. Dashon were abroad.&#xD;
4'iefore she went into retreat Rosemary had many private in-&#xD;
terviews with her grandfather, at one of which, the last and the&#xD;
most solemn and prolonged, "Cousin George" was present,&#xD;
and made a clean breast of it. It came out, then, that it was&#xD;
no temporary embarrassment, but utter ruin with which he&#xD;
struggled. To be sure his forgeries, cancelled by his uncle,&#xD;
had extinguished a mass of floating debt, but he was left with-&#xD;
&#xD;
out real resources of any kind, and an overwhelming expendi-&#xD;
ture. Mr. Dash on had insisted on the whole personal property&#xD;
being assigned to him; he took Mrs. Varick's diamonds from&#xD;
her person on the very night of the ball, in Rosemary's room,&#xD;
whither he imperiously summoned his niece ; the establishment&#xD;
in       street, conveyed to him, broken up, its belle crinoline&#xD;
summarily sent adrift, and the costly jim-crackery with which&#xD;
it was filled disposed of at auction, ceased to be a burden on his&#xD;
nephew's empty exchequer; in fine the sagacious old financier,&#xD;
hard as flint in his view of an offence against commercial confi-&#xD;
dence, nearly indemnified himself by stripping the criminal of&#xD;
every farthing of property. Then only, at his grandchild's&#xD;
prayer, he made a provision for the Varicks, in reality most&#xD;
ample, and intended to guard Varick himself against temptation.&#xD;
"This is your last chance,," said Mr. Dashon, sternly. "I give&#xD;
you the income of the generous amount which in my will is&#xD;
destined for your two children. You can live on it in luxury,&#xD;
without altering your apparent expenditure, and save enough&#xD;
to pay off by degrees all your obligations.  You know how to&#xD;
arrange that as well as I do. Do it, keep clear of the gaming&#xD;
table, of politicians and fast women, keep a tight rein on your&#xD;
wife's tendency to extravagance, and you may live honored and&#xD;
prosperous. Your children are provided for ; you have no&#xD;
need of more than your support; rich you can never be: if any&#xD;
one gave you a fortune you would not keep it a twelve-month."&#xD;
Varick swore a thousand oaths that he would follow his&#xD;
uncle's advice to the letter. He invoked the curses of Heaven&#xD;
on his own ingratitude, if he ever deviated again from the&#xD;
straight path.-&#xD;
"You owe everything to your cousin there," said the old&#xD;
man, bluntly. "I love her, and I know she prefers the honor&#xD;
of the family to gold, or I would have let the law take gs&#xD;
course before I would have paid a cent to save you from the&#xD;
state-prison."&#xD;
"1 did it for Roosey's sake and Augusta's and cousin Isabel's,&#xD;
as well as for my own, cousin George," said Rosemary. "I am&#xD;
sge that you will think of your wife and children as well as of&#xD;
me, and never let yourself get into difficulty again."&#xD;

She followed him afterwards to the door, and with a bright&#xD;
blush, in a whisper, advised him to go to confession. She&#xD;
knew by experience that it was the only sure way to get rid&#xD;
of our faults. The ex-alderman cocked his eye at her with an&#xD;
expression familiar on the stock-exchange and in the neigh-&#xD;
borhoo: of the City Hall. He promised to think seriously of&#xD;
her advice, and even took down the name of her confessor on&#xD;
his tablets.&#xD;
Such was the grinning   leton concealed in this splendid&#xD;
house, while the splendid mar iage came on apace. However,&#xD;
t seemed that they'had got the hideous anatomy securely&#xD;
under lock and key. The house over the way where the&#xD;
Varicks lived, now belonged to Mr. Dashon; the furniture was&#xD;
his from garret to cellar; the carriages, the horses, were his&#xD;
property ; and they had the usufruct during good behavior of&#xD;
their parent ; they had an assured income, sufficient to keep&#xD;
the machine going; vice itself could hardly throw away so&#xD;
nice a position, which, with a clean conscience and a good&#xD;
digestion, would be a paradise on earth.&#xD;
FROM MISS ROSE MARIE DASIION TO MISS GRACE ATIIERTON.&#xD;
"My DEAR GRACE,&#xD;
" I write you once more before I go to the con-&#xD;
vent to make my retreat. Everything is in a state of forward-&#xD;
ness, thanks to grandmamma's energy ; the trousseau is almost&#xD;
complete ; as we are going direct to Paris, the articles of&#xD;
dresses, laces, shawls, gloves and such trumpery are reduced to&#xD;
the strictly necessary for the voyage and our first arrival; so&#xD;
when you come on and wish to amuse yourself with inspecting&#xD;
everything, you will find my bridal outfit distinguished rather&#xD;
for elegance than profusion, excepting the line, which it be-&#xD;
lngs to my dignity to be amply provided with, and which is&#xD;
quite the envy of my dear cousins, who alone are permitted to&#xD;
see it. Augusta, poor girl! is nearly demented about my good&#xD;
fortune, and so angry that I did not at least ask her to be&#xD;
bridesmaid, that she wilLiardly speak to me. She is not aware&#xD;
that it is not my fault. Grandpapa interdicted it absolutely,&#xD;
and you have no idea low much vexed he was that -Col. do&#xD;
&#xD;
Floral (at my request, of course,) asked Roosey to act as&#xD;
groomsman-a word which M. le colonel finds very hard to&#xD;
pronounce, and an office which he seems to find nearly equal&#xD;
difficulty in comprehending. My corbeille will be superb. All&#xD;
the Varicks have been princely; Cousin Isabel even; I have&#xD;
seen nothing yet except the pearls from the Empress, and a&#xD;
set of ornaments made to match them precisely in fashion, but&#xD;
with brilliants substituted for pearls, and which is grandpapa's&#xD;
gift, far outshining in splendor and costliness the imperial&#xD;
present! To tell you the truth, dearest Grace, this last gift&#xD;
makes me tremble, as I know too much of the history of those&#xD;
very diamonds ; and so fatally did it happen that Cousin Isabel&#xD;
selecting some costly trinket for me at Ball's, was shown the&#xD;
set partly completed, and on which they were working day&#xD;
and night. Imagine her feelings ! Oh, my dear Grace, I am&#xD;
so sorry I told you that night what had happened, although it&#xD;
was hardly possible to avoid it when we found the diamonds&#xD;
tossed on the floor of my room, here one jewel, there another,&#xD;
and it became necessary somehow to explain it. Then you had&#xD;
got such a foolish idea in your head (forgive me, dear!) of&#xD;
sacrificing yourself to console poor Roosey, that I thought it&#xD;
best to tell you. Who could suppose from grandpapa's quiet&#xD;
manner and extreme gentleness to us girls, that he could ever&#xD;
be so violent, and even forget (I must say) what is due to a&#xD;
lady, no matter how guilty her husband may have been I&#xD;
"In answer to your question, the intended marriage is not a&#xD;
secret, dear, yet we say as little about it as possible. The cere-&#xD;
mony will be quite private, only our relations being invited.&#xD;
In regard to the reception, grandmanima has issued cards for a&#xD;
grand dress matinee, such as she gives every winter, and my&#xD;
card is placed in the envelope, but not Col. de Flordal's, so that&#xD;
although it i doubtless pretty well understood, it is not formally&#xD;
expressed that it is a leave-taking affair ; for it is known we .&#xD;
all sail for Europe the name day. The general, impression&#xD;
out of the family is that the marriage is to come off in Paris&#xD;
and I am afraid that grandmamma is responsible for that, as&#xD;
she told everybody so at first. That grandpapa 'should shrink&#xD;
from the publicity that naturally attends a marriage of this&#xD;

ROSEMARY TO GRACE ATHIERTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
kind, is very natural, but I have been a little surprised that&#xD;
grandmamma has the same feeling, she who is always so fond&#xD;
of making a great sensation, and knows so well how to do it.&#xD;
However, when the guests of the matinie (nobody will fail, I&#xD;
warrant you) are introduced to 'Madame la vicomtesse do&#xD;
Florall' and are shown the glittering corbeille (which is to be&#xD;
laid out in the state-bedroom), and see the gift of the Empress&#xD;
on the person of the bride in all its beamy lustre, no doubt it&#xD;
will be a very pretty coup de theatre. At a quarter past eleven&#xD;
precisely, I am to change my dress for the voyage ; at twenty&#xD;
minutes to twelve, we enter the carriage ; and the steamer's&#xD;
paddles are to begin to move at ten minutes past twelve pre-&#xD;
cisely. As the line belongs chiefly to grandpapa, there is no&#xD;
danger of our being left behind in case of accident ! So you&#xD;
see everything is arranged beforehand, as when some poor&#xD;
wretch is to be executed (the nearest comparison that occurs&#xD;
to me), and every tittle of the programme is to be punctually&#xD;
carried out ! Ah me! -dearest Grace !&#xD;
"It is at least a great relief that there will be no paragraphs&#xD;
in the newspapers beforehand, telling how I passed the pre-&#xD;
vious night, with what.appetite I eat my breakfast, and whether&#xD;
I am resigned or no to my fate! I jest, my dear child, for if I&#xD;
didn't, I should blot the letter with my tears. I am not un-&#xD;
happy-Heaven forbid ! The thought that I have not chosen&#xD;
this, that my parents, above all my dear, dear grandpapa&#xD;
Romarin have chosen for me; is infinitely reassuring. Were it,&#xD;
not for that,.I never should be able. to face the tremors, the&#xD;
wild Iniggivings, the panic fears, the repugnances even and&#xD;
mortal shames, which sometimes come upon me with an irre-&#xD;
sistible rush. I should take refuge in the convent certainly, if&#xD;
I listened to these presentiments;. but I keep ng eye steadily&#xD;
fixed upon the bright star of filial duty.. Col. ae Flordal is&#xD;
certainly everything that a young woman in my position could&#xD;
reasonably wish for, young, noble, handsome, brave, and accom-&#xD;
plished. Strange as it may seem, those"considerations' do not&#xD;
tranquilize me in the least.&#xD;
"I look forward to the voyage with almost unmixed plea-&#xD;
sure. You know I am never sea-sick, and it is a noble steamer.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our accommodations, too, will be so ample. We have taken&#xD;
three large state-rooms-one a sort of family affair for grand-&#xD;
papa and grandmamma-one for me and Louise--and one for&#xD;
Col. de Flordal, who honestly says that'he shall keep his berth&#xD;
till we reach Havre. He suffers dreadfully on all his voyages,&#xD;
and rather admits that his reason for proceeding immediately&#xD;
to Washington and remaining there so long, was to get rid of&#xD;
the effect of crossing the Atlantic on his personal, appearance.&#xD;
Should the voyage be of the ordinary length at this season, we&#xD;
shall hardly reach Paris till the 17th, and in that, case he will&#xD;
not be able to rest more than a few hours before he must set&#xD;
out for Sebastopol ! I pity him very much; yet I feel a strange&#xD;
comfort in what to most young brides, I suppose, and to me&#xD;
also under circumstances that I can imagine, would be a dread-&#xD;
ful prospect, that of our being probably separated for at least&#xD;
a year, while his life will be daily in danger in the trenches or&#xD;
in battle. In that time, I say to myself, becoming accustomed&#xD;
to consider myself as the wife of Flordal, writing to him, get-&#xD;
ting his letters, hearing of his brave actions, sympathizing with&#xD;
his dangers and his glory, praying for his safety, I shall end by&#xD;
loving him as a husband ought to be loved.&#xD;
"Adieu, my darling Grace ! I am sure that you will join me,&#xD;
as you promise, at the Convent, on the eventful morn. I know'&#xD;
very well that I shall be in a very different state of mind then,&#xD;
from my present. .The vanities which oppress my spirit now,&#xD;
-the- fears which I despise in, my innermost soul, though the&#xD;
inferior nature sinks under them, will have given place to the&#xD;
sacred tranquillity which one gains from reflecting on the short-&#xD;
ness of life, and the single importance of fulfilling our vocation,&#xD;
whatever it be. Pray for your own     .&#xD;
" ROSE MARIE."&#xD;
The morning came. Grace Atherton had arrived at the con-&#xD;
vent the night previous, but did not see Miss Dashon whoas&#xD;
the Superior smilingly informed them, was on "Mt. Thabor."&#xD;
At six o'clock, on the third of February, being Saturday, at&#xD;
the Mass, she saw her friend, who entered with one of the&#xD;
Religious, and tcnt her place in one of the stalls. Her rapt&#xD;
air, her profound recollection, awed Grace, who wept very&#xD;

TIHE VOCATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
much, Rosemary was attired in white, with a veil on her head,&#xD;
as on the day when she was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin;&#xD;
she had a lighted candle in her hand, and a book before  er-&#xD;
There was not a man'in the chapel except the priest and a boy&#xD;
who served Mass. The nuns sung hymns and antiphons while&#xD;
the Mass proceeded. Rosemary communicated, as did all the&#xD;
community, it being one of the days when they received.&#xD;
Grace also approached the altar, to offer her communion for&#xD;
her friend. About twenty minutes after, they met in the cell&#xD;
which Rose had occupied during her retreat. The two girls&#xD;
tenderly embraced.&#xD;
We shall not have time to breakfast, Rose," said her friend;&#xD;
"I have told Madam so; it is nearly seven, you must change&#xD;
your dress immediately, and get into the carriage. It will take&#xD;
us an hour to reach your grandpapa's, and then you have to&#xD;
dress for the ceremony. You can breakfast, you know, in your&#xD;
own room."&#xD;
"It would be utterly impossible for me to eat a single mouth-&#xD;
ful, had I ever so much time," said Rosemary.&#xD;
So Ithe white robe was slipped off, and her ordinary dress&#xD;
resumed ; in a few minutes, she was completely ready. Having&#xD;
received tie blessing and the embrace of the Superior and some&#xD;
of her special friends, she sprang into the carriage, which&#xD;
whirled away. The worthy Johnson was on the box; the foot-,&#xD;
man John was behind.&#xD;
"Where is your mother, Grace?" asked Rosemary.&#xD;
4 At home-that is, at the house in New York. She brought&#xD;
me here last night, and will be at the ceremony. So will papa."&#xD;
"How kind of them both. And Bessie too V'&#xD;
"And Bessie too."&#xD;
Embraces and tears the only answer. Yet Mademoiselle was&#xD;
quite calm, with a deeply softened look. Once only she smiled&#xD;
in her wonted gay manner. It was when she said-" Oh, Grace,&#xD;
.I came very near finding out I had no vocation for matrimony.&#xD;
It was the toss-up of a penny, I assure you, between the two&#xD;
, vows. I never decided till last night at confession!"&#xD;
"And now your mind is made up V"    -&#xD;
"Perfectly."&#xD;
&#xD;
" How did the good father convince you ?"&#xD;
" Well, it was very fortunate for me, you know, that it was&#xD;
the day of the ladies' confession, or I should have been obliged&#xD;
to go into town to see him. Not so fortunate for them, as I was&#xD;
at the grille a full half hour !"-with a gay smile.&#xD;
Come to the point, dear !"&#xD;
" Oh! there are' several points. Thus: First Point! My&#xD;
dear grand-parents, on both sides :-I am their only surviving&#xD;
descendant; the whole blood of two worthy families is in my&#xD;
veins; their hopes are centred in me; and they have been so&#xD;
kind to me; one nursed my infancy and childhood, the others&#xD;
trained my youth and surrounded me with splendor ; I ought&#xD;
not to disappoint all their expectations and let their race fail,&#xD;
unless my vocation is clear, and almost extraordinary. What&#xD;
my duty is, ordinarily, is clear as day."&#xD;
"I could have told you all that, child," said Grace, im-&#xD;
patiently.&#xD;
"Second Point !" pursued Rosemary, counting on her fingers.&#xD;
"' In calling me to the inheritance of vast wealth, Providence&#xD;
itself indicates my vocation. If I marry, grandpapa's fortune&#xD;
will one day be mine, and how much good can I do with it ?&#xD;
People may say that the Church is always looking out for such&#xD;
windfalls, and will never suffer a pious heiress to enter the&#xD;
cloister, when her doing so will divert millions from Catholic&#xD;
custody ; but that is a senseless objection. God, who can either&#xD;
dispense with means or employ them, as He thinks fit, may&#xD;
perhaps call such an heiress to leave everything and serve Him&#xD;
more by that renunciation than she could by devoting all her&#xD;
wealth to pious objects ; but ordinarily He gives the wealth to&#xD;
be used, and because in the actual order of His providence it&#xD;
will be needed. If you take the veil, my dear child, will your&#xD;
grandfather employ his enormous fortune in building churches,&#xD;
endowing charities, and so on? No: he will divide it among&#xD;
his other relatives, or give it to found some pernicious institu-&#xD;
tion like that college in Philadelphia, or a mere secular one&#xD;
like the noble library established by a rich man in this city.&#xD;
And what will you not do with it, I hope, for the glory of God&#xD;
and salvation of your fellow-creatures I He went on to enu-&#xD;

ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
merate the things I could do, and would do (very artful, wasn't&#xD;
it12) till my heart burned within me !"&#xD;
All these wise reasonings, repeated by Rosemary almost&#xD;
word for word, were uttered with a beautiful, clear, sweet&#xD;
feminine intonation that would have amusingly contrasted with&#xD;
the subject-matter, had not the hearer been of her own sex.&#xD;
"And this settled your mind ?" inquired Grace.&#xD;
" Oh, that wasn't near all. What was particularly to the&#xD;
point was the answer to what I said about my feelings towards&#xD;
M. de Flordal."&#xD;
Grace was at once vividly interested.&#xD;
"Well, he said it was not necessary I should have that&#xD;
romantic attachment I might read of in foolish novels ;"-Grace&#xD;
winced-" nor even that I should prefer him to all others, which&#xD;
in truth, Grace, was my grand difficulty; it was sufficient,&#xD;
strictly speaking, if my will-my rational will-was firmly&#xD;
resolved to love him exclusively when he became my husband,&#xD;
and there was a reasonable probability that I should be able to&#xD;
keep the resolution. Now that simple view of my duty quite&#xD;
set my mind at rest, for I have not a particle of doubt I shall&#xD;
love Col. de Floreal, when I am his wife ; I already love him&#xD;
so by anticipation: I should feel it to my very heart's core if he&#xD;
were to be guilty of any baseness, forfeit his word, blanch in&#xD;
the hour or shrink from the post of danger, Grace! ;Simply.&#xD;
as his betrothed, I would die for him without a murmur-if&#xD;
his life or honor were at stake ; and so much of his honor as is&#xD;
committed to my keeping"-with a lofty look-"in his absence&#xD;
or presence, I shall always know how to guard."&#xD;
Grace looked away to hide a tear.&#xD;
"After all," faltered she, "I had pictured another destiny&#xD;
for you, Rose-you so fitted to inspire the romantic attachment&#xD;
which Father N. pleases to decry-he's very right, no doubt"&#xD;
.-with a little sob ;-" and so fitted, too (let him say what he&#xD;
likes), to feel such an attachment yourself-a noble, whole-&#xD;
souled, generous being, if ever there was one, Rosemary !&#xD;
Don't I know you under all that regulated exterior? Well,&#xD;
well! you may, but I can't-that's all !" -And Grace- fairly&#xD;
burst into a passion of tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
831&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, of course every woman has that little secret spark of&#xD;
romance slumbering away down somewhere in her heart," said&#xD;
Rosemary, with a little tremor of the voice, though she smiled.&#xD;
"But, as Father N. said at last, it is only a few years-a very&#xD;
few years, my dear child ! and all will be over. Your husband&#xD;
will have followed you to the grave which closes at last&#xD;
over rich and poor, plain and beautiful, man and woman ; or&#xD;
you will be his widow, clothed in weeds instead of the bridal&#xD;
garments now ready for you-oh, it was beautiful, my dear&#xD;
Grace !-and the only thing of the slightest consequence to&#xD;
you then will be how you have fulfilled the duties of your&#xD;
state. See how it is, Grace ! I feel quite happy now ! I see,&#xD;
as it were, to the end of my life. I regret my country a little&#xD;
-but there ! lat haut !"-pointing upwards--" is the true&#xD;
patrie !"&#xD;
Long afterwards Grace remembered these words.&#xD;
Miss Dashon consulted her watch pretty often ; with John-&#xD;
son's horses and driving, it was not more than half an hour&#xD;
from the convent to Mr. Dashon's door; she made him go some&#xD;
squares out of his way in order to stop at Dr. Mannikin's. It&#xD;
was only half-past seven; the doctor was not up ; he kept them&#xD;
waiting a quarter of an hour; Grace was very impatient; she&#xD;
was afraid Rosemary would not be dressed in time ; but the&#xD;
latter insisted. Dr. Mannikin at last appeared and apologized&#xD;
for detaining the young ladies.&#xD;
"Doctor," said Rose, with a blush, "I remember that you&#xD;
once told me you had a sovereign remedy against sea-sickness.&#xD;
I want some of it."&#xD;
I thought you were never sea-sick, Miss Dashon."&#xD;
"VI want some now all the same, if you please.&#xD;
In about ten minutes, every one of which to Grace seemed&#xD;
an age, Dr. Mannikin had put up a little packet of powders,&#xD;
and written the directions for their use.&#xD;
"We shall see you by and by, doctor ?" asked Miss Ather..&#xD;
ton, as she raised her robe to jump into the carriage.&#xD;
"Of course I shall be in at the death !" replied Dr. Ezekiel,&#xD;
with his most simtor grin.&#xD;
"What an expression for such an occasion !" exclaimed Grace,&#xD;

&#xD;
indignantly, as they drove off. "Rose, I can't endure that&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"He is very skilful. Grandpapa's great regret in leaving&#xD;
home is the loss of his services."&#xD;
"So you are going to try if you can relieve Col. de Floryal's&#xD;
7nal de mer-are you? How generous of you.!" said Grace,&#xD;
ironically.&#xD;
" I am sure you would be equally so in my place."&#xD;
"Indeed I would not !" said Grace, with a toss of her pretty&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"Which of us loves him most then, I wonder," thought&#xD;
Rosemary, looking out of the carriage window, and turning&#xD;
suddenly pale, as they stopped at her grandfather's door.&#xD;
Everybody was up and expecting them for the last half&#xD;
hour. Grandmamma, completely dressed for the reception,&#xD;
was in a terrible fidget at their being so late. A magnificent&#xD;
collation was preparing, and the whole house was topsy-turvy.&#xD;
It did not seem possible that order would ever come out of it.&#xD;
But Black Jim moved about like Napoleon giving orders for a&#xD;
battle.&#xD;
AllMiss Dashon's trunks had been packed, locked and strap-&#xD;
ped down. It was necessary to open them. One portmanteau&#xD;
had been made for dresses, another for linen and underclothing,&#xD;
a third for her jewels, writing-desk and presents. Not one of&#xD;
them yet contained everything that was destined for it; the&#xD;
wedding-dress and Grace's bridesmaid attire hung side by&#xD;
side in the antique wardrobe. There were two French artists&#xD;
waiting to dress their hair. This took half an hour. The&#xD;
rest was a trifle. Grandmamma did not think so. She scolded&#xD;
roundly.&#xD;
"Two hours at least are necessary to dress a young lady&#xD;
properly for her marriage-do you understandI You have&#xD;
spent a whole week in saying your prayers, my child, and&#xD;
crowd your toilette into an hour ! That is absurd, do you&#xD;
understand ? And in ten minutes after you will be Madame la&#xD;
vicomtesse !"&#xD;
"Provided I look ever so pretty, grandmamma !" said Rose,&#xD;
embracing her hurriedly, "you will'forgive me, won't you ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Grace said afterwards that Rosemary did not appear to be&#xD;
agitated ; her whole anxiety seemed about being dressed in&#xD;
good season and looking her prettiest, to please grandmamma.&#xD;
She took her bath as usual; that could not hurt her, for she came&#xD;
from it glowing like the morn; by that time Grace herself was&#xD;
dressed and assisted her friend in the remainder of her toilette ;&#xD;
Louise had laid everything out, so that not a moment was lost.&#xD;
In fine, at five minutes to nine, Miss Dashon's bracelet was fast-&#xD;
ened, her gloves were on, her veil attached. She went into&#xD;
her grandmother's room to show herself; and grandmamma&#xD;
criticized some points of her attire. The dress was made in a&#xD;
peculiar fashion to suit her ornaments, being fastened down&#xD;
the front by a chain of pearl-brooches, looped together by&#xD;
strings of seed pearl. The skirt was almost hidden by point&#xD;
lace and bouquets of snowy flowers, but the corsage was&#xD;
entirely simple, with no ornament but the pearls and the per-&#xD;
fect shape to which it fitted, so perfect that a large bouquet&#xD;
placed in the bosom seemed necessary to shade down and half&#xD;
hide its elegance.&#xD;
"What a lovely neck you have, child," said grandmamma,&#xD;
adjusting the necklace : "and the head is like an empress.&#xD;
Don't look so pale, though-a little pallor is becoming in a&#xD;
bride, I allow, but everything come il faut, do you un-&#xD;
derstand ?"&#xD;
Just then Black Jim came to Miss Dashon's own door;with&#xD;
a cup of coffee and' a tiny glass about the size of Rosemary's&#xD;
gold thimble, brim-full of cognac, on a tray; and she went&#xD;
into her room to thank him in her gracious way for the atten-&#xD;
tion, and for remembering her request, and told him to set it&#xD;
down on the table.&#xD;
As she had been up since half-past four, and had not tasted&#xD;
a mouthful, she was very glad of it. Louise advised her to&#xD;
eat a biscuit with it, for fear the brandy should fly to her head,&#xD;
but Miss Dashon refused, for the reason that she would be&#xD;
obliged to brush her teeth afterwards, which she could not con-&#xD;
veniently do. But just as she had cleverly emptied the little&#xD;
thimble-glass into the coffee, smiling at her own dexterity,&#xD;
grandpapa came in, knowing she was dressed, and kissed her,&#xD;
&#xD;
332&#xD;
&#xD;
"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6853-00000169"/>&#xD;
and said that Col. de Flordal had arrived, that Monseigneur&#xD;
was there, and everything ready. The order was to be as in&#xD;
Europe ; that is, the grand-parents entered the library (fitted&#xD;
as a chapel, with a chaste and magnificent altar in white satin&#xD;
and gold, and altar furniture of silver gilt-all to be presented&#xD;
to the Church after the ceremony), followed by the bride and&#xD;
her bridesmaid, to meet the groom and groomsman there.&#xD;
Although there were only relatives present, and a few intimate&#xD;
friends like the Athertons, Dr. Mannikin as family physician;&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., the room was full.&#xD;
Ros mary drank her coffee.&#xD;
"Leak me for one moment by myself !" said she, "I will&#xD;
join yo 'n grandmamma's room, when I am ready.".&#xD;
They all went out; she locked the door of her room.&#xD;
"More prayers-do you understand ?" said grandmamma,&#xD;
with her short, contemptuous laugh.&#xD;
They could hear her dress rustle as she knelt at the little&#xD;
prie-dieu close to the door. One, two, three, five minutes&#xD;
elapsed.&#xD;
"Come !" said grandmamma, impatiently, " this won't do.&#xD;
Shall we never have done praying ' Call her, Miss Atherton."&#xD;
Grace called. No answer. She knocked. No answer.&#xD;
" Heavens ! she has fainted, perhaps !" cried grandmamma.&#xD;
Louise pushed Miss Atherton aside, and looked through the&#xD;
key-hole.&#xD;
" The child has fallen!" shrieked the nurse. "I see' her&#xD;
dress !",&#xD;
A full quarter of an hour elapsed before the door could be&#xD;
forced open. Close by it, in the corner, with her head resting&#xD;
on the.kneelitig cushion of the prie-dieu, where she had grad-&#xD;
ually slipped down, lay the body of RosE MARIE-already cold,&#xD;
and apparently quite dead.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE TRIUMPH OF THE WICKED.&#xD;
WE pass hastily over the scene of&#xD;
which followed this discovery: how Drs.conf sionand distress&#xD;
were summoned from the library, and the former, after a brief&#xD;
examination of the pulse, and a few minutes' aplicabrnef&#xD;
the stethoscope, pronounced the case beyond the reach of&#xD;
medical skill; how Dr. Mannikin after similar ceremonies&#xD;
confirmed this opinion by an ominous silence;  ar ceeur&#xD;
and one of the clergy (Miss Dashon's confessor), called i&#xD;
rom the blue room where they waited till the bride should be&#xD;
at the altar, before appearing in the temporary chae saw at&#xD;
once with eyes no less experienced than those of th physans,&#xD;
that nothing remained for them to do in sh  e physicians&#xD;
sole the survivors; how at the first word of touching  con--&#xD;
tion which fell from'the prelate's urbane lips, Mr. Dashon sank&#xD;
in the, arms of those around him, and was b&#xD;
wandering and face distorted to a sofa, stricken with  ey-.&#xD;
a dreadful sight, at which even Dr. Mannikin trembled and&#xD;
grew pale. Mr. Dashon then absorbed the attention of both&#xD;
the physicians. They removed him to his own room, and  ot&#xD;
him into bed. Grandmamma-all white ati and iandsg&#xD;

Atherton and Father N., who whispered to him words of com-&#xD;
fort. There lay Rosemary on the outside of her maiden couch,&#xD;
in her bridal array; white as a snow-drift, preternaturally&#xD;
cold, and already rigid as marble. The lips were closed, the&#xD;
expression was unalterably placid, the whole face like a beau-&#xD;
tiful classic mask carved in antique marble. All skepticism&#xD;
vanished at the sight of its calm majesty. Floral was stunned&#xD;
rather than agitated. The two gentlemen would have led him&#xD;
away, but he refused. They left him, thinking that perhaps&#xD;
when unobserved he would give way to his sorrow. Louise,&#xD;
kneeling at the foot of the bed and praying as fast as her lips&#xD;
could move, and Miss Atherton, standing at the head, with&#xD;
hands clasped, weeping incessantly, were all who remained.&#xD;
Floral turned to Grace and took her hand .&#xD;
"I sail for France in two hours," said he. "I shall not see&#xD;
you again; I must say one word before we part, even here.&#xD;
We made a sacrifice, Grace. Providence has not willed to&#xD;
accept it. If I shall escape the Russian bullets at Sebastopol,&#xD;
when peace shall have been declared, I will return to New&#xD;
York. I say no more."&#xD;
He raised her hand to his lips ; then, turning, he would have&#xD;
saluted the hand of his bride, but it was gloved ; he seemed to&#xD;
hesitate about imprinting a kiss on her forehead, and half bent&#xD;
over her for that purpose, when Louise sprang up indignantly&#xD;
and repelled him.&#xD;
"No, monsieur," she cried. "No man, living or dead, but&#xD;
her two grandpapas, and her father, has ever touched that&#xD;
virgin brow !"&#xD;
"She is right !" said Grace, freezingly.&#xD;
The young vicomte departed in silence. He took a formal&#xD;
leave of grandmamma. She expressed very coldly her regrets&#xD;
at his disappointment, and she brought him a letter sealed,&#xD;
which had been written to him by Mr. Dashon that morning.-~&#xD;
" He would have given it to you on ship-board, M. le vicomte,&#xD;
and I exact of you the promise not to open it till then."&#xD;
Then arrived the other physicians for whom grandmamma&#xD;
had sent. Three of the most eminent members of the profes-&#xD;
sion in the metropolis met Drs. Varick and Mannikin in the&#xD;

present. Their verdict was instantaneous and unanimous as to&#xD;
the fact; and the utter uselessness of attempting to restore&#xD;
anmstin Ms.l Tshon's sinapisms were ordered away,&#xD;
almost with a smile. The doctors differed extremely in their&#xD;

&#xD;
must have taken some form of prussic acid ; but in that case,&#xD;
she must have taken it herself the instant the door was closed&#xD;
upon her, and we should have found the bottle lying near, and&#xD;
the rogm would have been full of the peculiar odor of the&#xD;
'acid: whereas there is nothing of the kind."&#xD;
Here Louise unlocked her mistress's wardrobe, and took out&#xD;
the coffee-cup and tiny glass, with the tray.&#xD;
" These," pursued Dr. Mannikin, quietly, "were found upon&#xD;
the table; and by my direction Louise here put them under&#xD;
lock and key. The last thing Miss Dashon was observed to do&#xD;
was to drink this coffee, of which about a spoonful remains. I&#xD;
suggest that it be put into a vial, and submitted to Drs. C. and&#xD;
D. for chemical analysis."~~&#xD;
"That will be eminently proper, but it will be a mere  fornd-&#xD;
lity," said Dr. D., who was present ; "no agent which myana-&#xD;
lysis can discover, would produce death in so short a time."&#xD;
"Precisely," continued the toxicologist. "What, in fact, are&#xD;
the known poisons ? Strychnine, which causes violent anguish&#xD;
and convulsions, and leaves the strychnine grin on the counte-&#xD;
nance, and the body arched with opisthotonos ; arsenic, opium,&#xD;
aconite, all of which produce symptoms more or less painful and&#xD;
prolonged. There is not one in the list which our actual&#xD;
knowledge of their effects does not enable us to exclude. This&#xD;
death has been equally sudden and painless. Except the by-&#xD;
drocyanic acid group of agents, I repeat, there is none capable&#xD;
of such an effect; and any agent of that group would be r-&#xD;
cognizable by the peculiar and penetrating fragrance which is&#xD;
sometimes exhaled by the body for hours."&#xD;
The hypothesis of poison was unanimously overruled in view&#xD;
of these reasonings ; but Dr. Varick persisted in desiring an au-&#xD;
topsy, to ascertain the real cause of his niece's death. Then&#xD;
Madam Dashon flared up angrily.i&#xD;
"My grandchild shall not be touched," said she. "Is Miss&#xD;
Dashon a poor girl whose sudden death may be ascribed to her&#xD;
own hand, as if she had some disgrace to hide-do you under-&#xD;
stand ? Such a proposition would have been more horrible to her&#xD;
than a thousand deaths. She was the chastest creature that ever&#xD;
put on a bridal veil, do you understand 3 Except Louise there,&#xD;
&#xD;
her nurse, who took care of her when she was a bab&#xD;
eye ever saw her otherwise than covered. I mean that hert&#xD;
comparable modesty shall be respected now-she shall be buried&#xD;
as she is, in her bridal dress. It is the least I can do for my&#xD;
poor little Rose---she was so innocent !"&#xD;
With these words, the stern and worldly grandmamma broke&#xD;
out ito a loud passion of weeping. It was almost as terrible&#xD;
a thing to see as Mr. Dashon's paralysis.&#xD;
The next day the chemists reported that the analysis of the&#xD;
coffee revealed no poison whatever; there were some  omtic&#xD;
matters extremely volatile, which had been used apparently to&#xD;
flavor either the coffee or the cognac; but certain  rntyn&#xD;
deleterious. Under these circumstances the physicians did&#xD;
hesitate to draw up a report of the death, as resulting from&#xD;
some unknown cause, whether moral or-physical producing &#xD;
sudden suspension of the vital functions'; and the coroner,&#xD;
after reading the certificate, and privately inspectin a coroeue&#xD;
(handed him by one of the servants in an envelope), perceived&#xD;
that there was nothing in the case to warrant him in holding&#xD;
an inquest.&#xD;
Then arose the question of the funeral. Mrs Dash&#xD;
too much overpowered with grief and too much occupied with&#xD;
the care of her husband, whose state required incessant atten-&#xD;
tion, to give a single order. Dr. Mannikin, the family physi-&#xD;
cian, and Mrs. Varick, niece of both grandpapa and   d&#xD;
mamma Dashon, and now their next heir, as well as nearest&#xD;
neighbor, attended to everything. The sexton of St Hubert&#xD;
-Dr. Clerestory's church, and attended by all the Varick&#xD;
Dashonswas called in and entrusted with the details. He&#xD;
was requested not to insert any notice in the paers'-it&#xD;
vlgar proceeding--but to send round invitations to all the&#xD;
friends of the family. An unexpected difficulty arose in regard&#xD;
to the funeral services.&#xD;
As Miss Dashon was a Catholic, it was de   d&#xD;
notify her pastor that any services which he thought t, should&#xD;
e 'performed at the house, or the body taken to church, if&#xD;
desired Grandmamma Dashon herself spoke of this as emi-&#xD;
nently proper--do you understand?&#xD;

But when the worthy pastor called to make the necessary&#xD;
inquiries, he learned that after the services, the body would be,&#xD;
of course taken to Greenwood, where Mr. Dashon owned a&#xD;
whole hillock crowned with wood-the finest position in the&#xD;
entire cemetery. Then the priest, with infinite courtesy, re-&#xD;
gretted that recourse must be had to the Archbishop, for with-&#xD;
out special permission he could not perform the rites of the&#xD;
church over a body that was to be laid in unconsecrated&#xD;
ground. Imagine the astonishment and indignation of the&#xD;
family-of grandmamma, even-at the proposition to bury&#xD;
Miss Dashon in Calvary cemetery. They did not know there&#xD;
was such a place-and what kind of a place '? In vain Mrs.&#xD;
Atherton entreated, offering a grave in her own lot. Grand-&#xD;
mamma was obdurate on that point. Rose should be buried&#xD;
where her grandfather and grandmother. could afterwards be&#xD;
laid by her side ; by the side of her own father, who was also&#xD;
buried at Greenwood, and whose coffin was now the only one&#xD;
in Mr. Dashon's solid and spacious vault. She intended to&#xD;
erect the most beautiful monument over her granddaughter&#xD;
that ever was seen on the continent, and the Archbishop might&#xD;
bless their lot, or the vault, or the place where Rose was to lie&#xD;
(if he pleased), but there, blessing or no blessing, the child&#xD;
should be interred. This was said to Father L., with great&#xD;
calmness, and an eye that flashed, a lip that quivered, with&#xD;
pride and anger. So the end was that there were no Catholic&#xD;
services over the body of the pious Rose Marie. Dr. Clerestory'&#xD;
came to the house and read the beautiful service of his church,&#xD;
to a crowd robed in mourning. Thus the occasion was not lost&#xD;
of a great lesson to the worldly-minded. Never was the rector&#xD;
of St. Hubert's more bitterly felicitous in denouncing the vani-&#xD;
ties of the world. What a text did not that sumptous array,&#xD;
those imperial ornaments, furnish, when they served to shroud&#xD;
and adorn a corpse for its funeral ! The gilded saloons of the&#xD;
Dashons echoed, amid a thrilling silence of all present, his&#xD;
biting antitheses, his pungent and almost personal denuncia-&#xD;
tions. If it was in some respects a false deal of the last enemy,&#xD;
it is a comfort to think that the most was made of it for the&#xD;
good cause. A file of carriages half a mile long convoyed&#xD;

&#xD;
BOOK      III.&#xD;
INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.&#xD;
HERE we may truly say : "Much have my books disclosed,&#xD;
but the end is hidden."&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
MEETING AT THE FERRY.&#xD;
Tnis was the first week in May, and already the weather was&#xD;
delightful. The gentlemen crossing the Wall street ferry to-&#xD;
wards the hour of six, to seek their homes and dinners on the&#xD;
Brooklyn side, came out of the ladies' cabin, where gentlemen&#xD;
do chiefly congregate, and gathered on the guards of the boat&#xD;
to enjoy the breeze from the Narrows and the view of the bay.&#xD;
Few cities can boast of a finer transit between their suburbs.&#xD;
New York Bay has indeed no smoking Vesuvius, no Sorrentine&#xD;
promontory of crested purple, no blue Ischia and Capri, faint&#xD;
as clouds, but seen with grand steep outline in the dim horizon;&#xD;
the Battery is not a St. Elmo, bold, picturesque and menacing.&#xD;
Yet the islands, the forts, the innumerous shipping, the white&#xD;
steam-fleet passing and repassing in all directions, the sea-gus&#xD;
flying, the point of the city jutting out between a greatsta of&#xD;
and a great estuary, the East River receding in a fne vist o&#xD;
masts and flags and ship-yards, like the Golden Horn of Stain-&#xD;
boul, the blue headland of Staten Island. in the southhere&#xD;
a huge black sea-steamer running up from Sandy Hook, there&#xD;
a snow-white and elegantly modelled Sound steamboat gliding&#xD;
&#xD;
out of her berth with a perfect mass of human beings crowding&#xD;
all her decks: this, in the rays of the declining sun, has a&#xD;
poetry of young civilization that makes amends for some&#xD;
deficiencies of natural sublimity and historical tradition.&#xD;
A striking feature is Brooklyn Heights. At this season their&#xD;
high embankments were already green ; the shrubbery on their&#xD;
terraces had already leafed out; the fruit-trees on the height&#xD;
were in blossom, and the fragrance mingled with the refreshing&#xD;
breath of the sea. Just where the bloom was thickest rose a&#xD;
mansion of brick, stone-ped, that seemed an old family&#xD;
residence, as age is counted in the New World : close by was a&#xD;
new gothic church, with gr buttresses and traceried windows&#xD;
and floriated cross.&#xD;
Brooklyn; in one point of view a beautiful suburb, in another&#xD;
is a large city. Why not ? It has gas, water (somewhat pre-&#xD;
carious), a Mayor and Common. Council (as corrupt as our&#xD;
own), taxes! What does it ck ? True, for libraries, picture-&#xD;
galleries, newspapers (that are newspapers), and almost all&#xD;
sorts of amusements, sucl as theatres, operas, negro-minstrels,&#xD;
model-artists, &amp;amp;c., thexBrooklynites must repair to New York :&#xD;
still, they have a Philharmonic, an Academy of Music mnd Henry&#xD;
Ward Beecher's church: so that it is not exact to say that&#xD;
they are dependent on New York for the means of elegant&#xD;
recreation. They are great patrons of lectures, concerts aid&#xD;
sermons-are the well-dressed people who dine, lodgeand&#xD;
breakfast in Brooklyn, but who live the energetic and pro-&#xD;
ductive part of their lives on our side of the East River : it is&#xD;
" the city of churches," as every one knows. It is also the&#xD;
See of a Bigop, which anciently in Europe constituted any&#xD;
place a city. And the more fashionable New Yorkeis, who do&#xD;
not visit iton any other occasion, are sure to do so at last on&#xD;
one oc 'on : for there ; that is, on the sof en hills beyond&#xD;
it, overlooking the ocean ; lies the great metropatitan cemetery&#xD;
with its charming groves, its lovely flowers and sumptuous&#xD;
monuments.&#xD;
But to return to the Wall street ferry-boat. There is nothing&#xD;
astonishes a foreigner so much as the American ferry-boats.&#xD;
In England they, have nothing like them. At Gosport, we&#xD;

3844  'ROSEMARY.'&#xD;
remember, there is a sort of floating-bridge, as they absurdly&#xD;
call it, that is steamed across a tide-water, with a chain&#xD;
attached, which it takes in and pays out as it slowly moves&#xD;
across. But a boat crossing a foaming estuary or rapid river&#xD;
at full speed, with hundreds of foot-passengers and perhaps&#xD;
twenty vehicles at once, and landing all securely, comfortably,&#xD;
without a moment's loss of time, is an American institution.&#xD;
The boat we are watching was crowded with drays and wagons,&#xD;
and among the rest was a large family carriage, got up in a&#xD;
style that could not fail to attractgeneral observation. It was&#xD;
one of those dark-brown coaches, silk-lined and superbly&#xD;
hammercloth'd, which the wealt  st citizens of the metropolis&#xD;
have recently affected. It wa  rawn by a splendid pair of'&#xD;
powerful blacks, perfectly matched, and driven by a coach-&#xD;
man in a black livery, with a crape on his hat. A footman,&#xD;
also'in deep mourning, stood behind. The lining and hammer-&#xD;
cloth also were black, with the initials C. R. D. in silver on the&#xD;
latter. On the back seat sat a venerable gray-haired old man,&#xD;
looking very broken in health, and perhaps in mind also-for&#xD;
his glance was restless, and his lips perpetually moved without&#xD;
uttering anything ; and by his side a erand-looking old lady,&#xD;
with a silvery face and severe expression. On the seat opposite&#xD;
her was a basket of fresh flowers, which was supported by a&#xD;
handsome, stylish girl, with long auburn curls, and wandering.&#xD;
light blue eyes. All three of the persons inside the coach&#xD;
were in the deepest mourning.&#xD;
Many of the gentlemen on the guards, while they conversed&#xD;
with each other, or enjoyed the view in solitude, amused them-&#xD;
selves also *ith inspecting the aristocratic eqi page, with its&#xD;
superb horses, footman, liveries, and distinguished-looking&#xD;
occupants. The handsome girl  came in for her full share of&#xD;
these glances,.  eh she returned with that impert  ble air&#xD;
of unconscioii less which a New York girl in good society&#xD;
commonly acquires after the first winter or two, and. which&#xD;
some young ladies indeed possess in all its perfection long&#xD;
before they leave school. At the same time she manifested&#xD;
:      - ' her real consciousness of the attention she attracted by talking&#xD;
a great deal to the elder lady, accompanying her remarks by&#xD;
&#xD;
MEETING AT THE FERRY.&#xD;
&#xD;
34$&#xD;
&#xD;
frequent smiles, and movements of what might be thought&#xD;
rather a studied grace. She played with the flowers in the&#xD;
basket beside her, talked about them evidently, and held up,&#xD;
to admire it, one delicate and beautiful wreath of snow-white&#xD;
-jessamine. The old lady replied to the young one with a lofty&#xD;
courtesy, a little icy perhaps, and an occasional ironical smile.&#xD;
The old gentleman took no notice of either, nor of their con-&#xD;
versation, except when the young girl lifted the wreath, when&#xD;
he grew excited, and interfered to make her lay it down.&#xD;
A party of gentlemen engaged in earnest conversation&#xD;
seemed to observe neither the fine coach nor the attention it&#xD;
attracted. They were friends who had met accidentally in&#xD;
crossing the ferry, and all known to us. The senior O'Morra,&#xD;
with his pale aud bitter physiognomy, his tall, spare form, and&#xD;
wiry elegance, was returning'to his dinner and evening's work&#xD;
at home, after an exhausting day in court, where he had&#xD;
argued a case four hours. His son, whose hours and method&#xD;
of labor were quite different from his father's, was coming back&#xD;
from a canter on the Bloomingdale road, as his high riding&#xD;
boots, pulled over dark-grey pants, his dark-grey jacket, whip,&#xD;
and riding-cap, sufficiently declared. Young America does&#xD;
not always look well in this dashing costume, but Rory did,&#xD;
which naturally implies that he had an admirable figure, as&#xD;
the young lady in the carriage evidentlyghought, for she&#xD;
regarded him very attentively ; with the more security, as his&#xD;
attention was divided between his friends and his horse, whose&#xD;
bridle was thrown over his arm as he leaned against the rail that&#xD;
separated the foot passengers from the carriages. The other&#xD;
gentlemen were Count Wissen, in travelling costume, valise in,&#xD;
hand, just returned from Washington after an absence of several&#xD;
months; and Dr. Galenson, who was crossing the ferry in his&#xD;
buggy to make a somewhat needless professional visit in&#xD;
Brooklyn, and who had got out to shake hands with the Count.&#xD;
"What news from Washington ? Weather insufferably hot, I&#xD;
Suppose 3"&#xD;
"And the dust worse than the deserts of Numidia where I&#xD;
used to fight the Arabs. What induced your legislators-to&#xD;

&#xD;
select such a place as Washington for the capital of the Con-&#xD;
federation, instead of New York, I cannot conceive."&#xD;
" Oh, it would never do," said Mr. O'Morra, "if the political&#xD;
and commercial capital coincided-that would be a central-&#xD;
ization which in our system we must avoid."&#xD;
" Yes : that is a feature of your intensely artificial system of&#xD;
government. I object to the system. There is a natural place&#xD;
in every country for the sovereign power to reside ; and to&#xD;
plant it elsewhere is no less absurd than it would be (doctor)&#xD;
to stick a man's head, as the ruling power, in his stomach, on&#xD;
the pretext that it would then be equidistant from all parts of&#xD;
the body it has to govern."&#xD;
O'Morra smiled grimly at the felicitous illustration, but he&#xD;
observed :-" If it were a monarchy, you would be right.. As&#xD;
an old Jeffersonian States Rigbts democrat, count"-a still&#xD;
grimmer smile-" I cannot agree with you."&#xD;
" Ah, you are a democrat !" said the minister, laughing :&#xD;
"that is to say, an aristocrat ; for I observe that in America&#xD;
the terms are synonymous. Ah, well ! there is a bit of scandal&#xD;
in Washington about one of your democrats. You know Mr.&#xD;
Varick, I suppose,-one of the principal sachems (I think they&#xD;
call it) of New York ?"&#xD;
"I do not," said Mr. O'Morra, with some haughtiness.&#xD;
"Why, he is  democrat also," said the count.&#xD;
'"Ah, count, you are not skilled in conchology, I see !" inter-&#xD;
posed Galenson, laughing. "Mr. Varick is a soft-shell, and&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra a hard-shell democrat. It is the bitterest differ-&#xD;
ence known in politics."&#xD;
" Ah! a hard-shell! Mr. O'Morra is a hard-shell'?" replied&#xD;
the count, puzzled, but laughing as if he understood it.&#xD;
"Well, what rascality has Varick been perpetrating now '"&#xD;
asked O'Morra. "Has he picked a pocket, or committed mur-&#xD;
der ? for otherwise I cannot conceive how he should attract&#xD;
public attention."&#xD;
"Well, you've hit surprisingly near ; but as the charge is&#xD;
bruited by his enemies, and there may be no truth in it, you&#xD;
will excuse my not entering into particulars here. So, doctor,&#xD;
how is your fair patient at Miss Tankerville's, may I ask 'I"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Miss Marie's health seems now, I am happy to say, per-&#xD;
fectly re-established. I believe she appears at dinner with the&#xD;
family for the first time to-day."&#xD;
Both the count and Rory O'Morra reddened--in the former&#xD;
'a most unusual occurrence: but there is one natural emotion&#xD;
the expression of which on the countenance not diplomacy&#xD;
itself was ever able to suppress.&#xD;
" Her incognito is then still preserved ?" demanded the count,&#xD;
glancing at Mr. O'Morra.&#xD;
"My father knows all about it," said Rory.&#xD;
"It would have been cruel to seek out her parents, while&#xD;
her life was an extreme uncertainty," observed Galenson; "and&#xD;
since she has been able to express a wish, it has been for&#xD;
secrecy, which we have scrupulously respected."&#xD;
" You were perfectly right," said the count, with emphasis.&#xD;
"In restoring her prematurely to her family, ignorant as we&#xD;
are of the circumstances, we might be pushing her back into&#xD;
the lion's den."&#xD;
Meanwhile the boat had come to a full stop, in consequence&#xD;
of a large fishing smack coming down under full canvas be-&#xD;
tween her and her berth, when according to the laws of the&#xD;
port and the waters the steam-vessel had to give way. Turning&#xD;
round to see what caused the detention, our friends simulta.&#xD;
neously observed the mourning carriage.&#xD;
"They are going to Greenwood, doubtless," observed Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra, in the dry tone in which men of the world speak of&#xD;
these things.&#xD;
"It is rather late unless they mean to arrive precisely at&#xD;
sunset," remarked Galenson, consulting his watch. "Talk of&#xD;
the devil"-added he, glancing at young O'Morra. "You and&#xD;
I have seen that young lady before, Rory."&#xD;
" I don't remember where," said Rory, who did not recognize&#xD;
Augusta in her deep mourning.&#xD;
But the count recognized immediately both her and grand-&#xD;
mamma, the latter of whom bowed, though distantly.&#xD;
" Ah, I must speak to them," said the Minister, advancing to&#xD;
the carriage window.&#xD;
." I am very happy to see yotr excellency. again," said grand-&#xD;

mamma, in a tone which said the very reverse.  ' It is a long&#xD;
time since we met. Mr. Dashon, this is Coiut W issen, whom&#xD;
you, remember. Ah, excuse him, count-b -, members no&#xD;
one, do you understand '?-no one butr-ah! you remember her,&#xD;
count! It was a terrific thing-was it not I  he was full of&#xD;
life and happiness but the moment before. We but turned our&#xD;
backs and she was dead ! You have heard all the circum-&#xD;
stances from your friend ?"&#xD;
" Floral sailed, you recollect, two hours after," replied the&#xD;
Minister, "and it was not till he reached Paris that he wrote&#xD;
me. I got the letter in Washington a fortnight since, on my&#xD;
return from a trip South."&#xD;
" Ahi! then you know very little. Her grandfather has&#xD;
never recovered it. A perfect wreck, as yon see. He has only&#xD;
sense to know his darling is dead. We go every afternoon to&#xD;
Greenwood to lay a fresh wreath on the coffin. Do you know&#xD;
that we buried her in her bridal attire, count, the pearls of the&#xD;
Empress and all, do you understand ? I resolved that nobody&#xD;
else should ever wear or possess them, do you understand ?"-&#xD;
With a very stern look, and glancing bitterly at the unconscious&#xD;
Augusta.-" One day I mean to go to Paris, and thank her&#xD;
Imperial Majesty for the gift to my child, and tell her that&#xD;
Rose, having once put them on, never laid them aside, and&#xD;
that she will wear them forever-do you understand 'U-With&#xD;
her short, bitter laugh.&#xD;
"T should fear such things might not be secure even in a&#xD;
vault," observed the count, glancing up at Johnson, who leaned&#xD;
slightly over the side, red in the face as a turkey-cock.&#xD;
"Oh! perfectly safe ! our vault has a bank-safe lock. Le&#xD;
grand liable himself could not pick it, do you understand '&#xD;
You could not open it in a hundred years with the -key, unless&#xD;
you had the secret. I can't open it myself-nobody in the&#xD;
house can but Johnson, my coachman-as faithful a fellow as&#xD;
ever breathed, do you understand ? But the boat is up at last.&#xD;
Adieu, ill. le ministre. I shall be pleased to see you, if you&#xD;
think proper to call upon an old woman who has lost every-&#xD;
thing worth living for."&#xD;
The boat had touched the swing platform; the chains&#xD;
&#xD;
creaked ; the rushing crowd bore our pedestrians on; - ory&#xD;
had mounted his horse, which was restive at the concussion&#xD;
and the noise, and backed close to the carriage-window&#xD;
Augusta affected to be frightened and screamed. At that&#xD;
Johnson leaned back insolently and touched the horse on the&#xD;
back with his long whip. The animal sprang forward and with&#xD;
one bound cleared both the chains, nearly throwing his rider&#xD;
against the beams of the bridge. Then the chains were thrown&#xD;
down and the carriage rolled on. Rory said nothing, but looked&#xD;
at Johnson, and bowed to the ladies, as it passed. His temper&#xD;
was fortunately as good as his seat. The carriage turned immedi-&#xD;
ately down towards the Atlantic ferry, the road to Greenwood.&#xD;
In a moment it was flashing along directly under Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville's house, where at the same time Rory could perceive in&#xD;
the balcony of what was formerly his own room, the figure of&#xD;
a lady in white, who by her action seemed to watch it with&#xD;
much interest as it passed beneath her.&#xD;

DINING WITH THE BOARDERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
DINING wITH THE BOARDERS.&#xD;
MIss TANKERVILLE's boarders experienced a'sensation when&#xD;
the mysterious invalid made her appearance for the first time._&#xD;
The ladies had all called upon her previously, except a certain&#xD;
Miss Graves, a music-teacher, who perhaps feared to intrude ;&#xD;
and a certain Madame d'Ehrenstein, Graefinn von Ehrenstein,&#xD;
a friend of Count Wissen's, who probably feared to compromise&#xD;
her own dignity, not knowing who "Miss Marid" might be.&#xD;
The question who Miss Marid was, had not indeed received&#xD;
any satisfactory answer.-" A friend of Mr. Rory O'Morra's,"&#xD;
was the most intelligible, as well as the most plausible. Mr.&#xD;
Rory and his great friend Count Wissen had brought her to the&#xD;
house from a party (so it was believed), in a state of insen-&#xD;
sibility, and she had occupied ever since Mr. Rory's room.&#xD;
The ladies' generally received theory was that Mr. Rory had&#xD;
run away with her, and some said they were on the point of&#xD;
marriage when the illness supervened which had turned out so&#xD;
much more serious than any one anticipated. Three entire'&#xD;
months had elapsed since she had been brought to the house;&#xD;
old boarders had moved away, new ones had come, and felt&#xD;
little curiosity about Miss Marie, till they imbibed it by sym-&#xD;
pathy. All were delighted to learn that at last they were to&#xD;
have an opportunity of seeing the young lady herself, criticizing&#xD;
her dress, her manners and her beauty, and observing how she&#xD;
would behave towards the gentlemen who were understood to&#xD;
be responsible for her.&#xD;
It was a new scene for Rosemary : so many people of differ-&#xD;
ent names, families and professions, with such obvious and&#xD;
marked distinctions in appearance and manners, yet not assem-&#xD;
bled as guests, all equally at home, and as it seemed to her&#xD;
&#xD;
almost impertinently at their ease ; she had never felt under so&#xD;
much restraint in her life. The gentlemen were all introduced&#xD;
to her by young Mrs. Varick, Miss Tankerville's married sister,&#xD;
Miss Tankerville herself being too busy for the office. What&#xD;
added to the mystification was that Mrs. Varick introduced&#xD;
Miss Marie as "a cousin of Capt. Varick's," which, if any&#xD;
doubt had previously existed of Marie being a real name, com-&#xD;
pletely removed it. Mr. Rus6, who was a foreign consul, knew&#xD;
several Marids, wealthy merchants, both in New York and at&#xD;
Antwerp, but failed to elicit from Rosemary a statement of the&#xD;
particular branch to which she belonged. She simply replied&#xD;
that her father was never in business and had been dead many&#xD;
years. A Mr. Seymour, whose wife had called on Miss Mari6,&#xD;
-their room was next hers-made her a most verbose and&#xD;
flourishing compliment on her restoration to health, in lan-&#xD;
guage rather high-flown and not always grammatical; in reply&#xD;
to which he received a very gracious smile and "thank you,"&#xD;
and retired, convinced, as was Mrs. S., that he had made a&#xD;
beautiful speech. The dissipated Bill Forrester, a man six&#xD;
foot three, with a brown beard a foot long, a large beautiful&#xD;
white hand, and faultlessly got up for dinner in ample crimson&#xD;
velvet waistcoat and gold buttons, and a profusion of exquisite&#xD;
linen adorned with diamond studs, bowed low to Miss Marid,&#xD;
offered her his great white hand with paternal affectionateness,&#xD;
and expressed the general delight of all the old bachelors on&#xD;
his story at her recovery, with so much archness and mellow&#xD;
humor, that Rosemary laughed frankly, while she affected not&#xD;
to see the proffer of his hand. Forrester pronounced her a fin-&#xD;
ished coquette.&#xD;
In the midst of this entered Count Wissen and Mr. Rory&#xD;
O'Morra with Dr. Galenson, who had accepted an invitation to&#xD;
dinner.&#xD;
" Ah !" said Wissen, " there she is in the west window !&#xD;
White muslin to the throat, and a rose sash-simple and exqui-&#xD;
site as a flower !"&#xD;
" I should not have known her !" said Rory.&#xD;
"It has to m   all' the effect of an apparition," said the&#xD;
count. " Docto;r! I honor your skill and envy your triumph a,&#xD;

&#xD;
such a moment. To think that we should ever have seen that&#xD;
enchanting form laid out in a coffin! Can you fancy, O'Morra,&#xD;
that your too fortunate hand-?"&#xD;
"Hush !" said Rory, impatiently.&#xD;
"Well, let us go up and speak to her."&#xD;
"You forget that she does got know either you or me. Dr.&#xD;
Galenson must introduce us."&#xD;
"Oh, yes, doctor ! by all means introduce me to Miss Mari,"&#xD;
said Count Wissen, with a peculiar smile ; "and I will present&#xD;
O'Morra."&#xD;
The young lady received Count Wissen's profound bow with&#xD;
a bend as gracefully reserved as if she had never set eyes&#xD;
upon him before ; yet as she raised her head some might have&#xD;
marked a glance of intelligence pass between them; but the&#xD;
count slightly turning in his courtly way, said:&#xD;
"Permit me, Miss lMiarid "-with a slight emphasis on the&#xD;
name-" to introduce my very intimate friend, Mr. Rory&#xD;
O'Morra."&#xD;
The young lady hesitated a moment-appeared half discon-&#xD;
certed at something in the bearing or figure or face of the tall&#xD;
and handsome youth who bowed before her-then with a frank&#xD;
movement extended her hand.&#xD;
"I cannot affect ignorance," said she, in a sweet low tone,&#xD;
"of the many obligations I am under to Mr. Rory O'Morra."&#xD;
"You overpower me, madam !" says Mr. Rory, without the&#xD;
slightest hesitation raising the hand to his lips.&#xD;
"You seem to have forgotten me," pursued the young lady&#xD;
with a deep flush, while the others drew aside and left them&#xD;
together in the window.&#xD;
"Forgotten you, Miss MariC ! I saw you under circum-&#xD;
stances-so very-different," stammered Mr. Rory.&#xD;
Rosemary smiled: "I do not refer to that-I can well be-&#xD;
lieve I am changed since that dreadful night. But long before&#xD;
.-weeks before at least-do you not remember, Mr. O'Morra,&#xD;
going home with --"&#xD;
"Not another word !" exclaimed Rory, impetuously, all the&#xD;
blood in his body rushing to his cheek; "Is it possible you&#xD;
are that young lady I I accuse myself," added he, penitently,&#xD;
&#xD;
"of not even looking at her face-so I could not without a&#xD;
miracle remember it."&#xD;
"I remembered you the first moment you entered the room,"&#xD;
said Rosemary, frankly.&#xD;
But just then the count advanced with a lady on his arm,&#xD;
and apologizing to O'Morra, said to Rosemary :-&#xD;
".The Countess d'Ehrenstein wishes to know you, Miss&#xD;
Marie."&#xD;
" Any friend of M. de Wissen I shall always know very&#xD;
pleasingly," said the countess.&#xD;
"And this is Mile. Ang6lique d'Ehrenstein, or if you please,&#xD;
the Countess Angelica," pursued Wissen, drawing forward a&#xD;
very simple child of ten years.&#xD;
Again Miss Mari6's dark eyes flashed a recognition, and one&#xD;
which sent her blood back from her tell-tale cheek to the&#xD;
heart: for this was the plain, motherly lady who was leaning&#xD;
on Col. de Flor6al's arm the first time she ever saw him, when&#xD;
she went to the Amboy boat for Grace. She had not reco-&#xD;
vered from this little shock, when Mr. Cahal O'Morra came in&#xD;
just as the dining-room doors were thrown open, approached&#xD;
Miss Mari immediately, shook hands with her without any&#xD;
introduction, and led her in to dinner.&#xD;
It was about the liveliest dinner-table to which Rose&#xD;
Dashon had ever site down. At first the conversation ran&#xD;
upon herself, or rather her recovery, on which Dr. Galenson&#xD;
was highly complimented. Galenson modestly disclaimed the&#xD;
merit of the cure, and Mr. Rus6, a pallid, quiet person, who&#xD;
said very bold things with extreme suavity, deplored that Miss&#xD;
Tankerville had not invited Dr. Mannikin to share Dr. G len-&#xD;
son's ovation.&#xD;
"I asked him once before you all, and he declined," said&#xD;
Miss Tankerville.&#xD;
"I was so sorry you didn't insist," said Mrs. Seymour. "I&#xD;
think him so interesting."&#xD;
"You are not the only married lady of that opinion," said&#xD;
Rus6.&#xD;
"Fie! Mr. Ruse, how can you be so malicious !" cried&#xD;
young Mrs. Varick. "Do you forget that Dr. Mannikin is&#xD;

DINING WITH THE BOARDERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Tankerville's cousin V'-Mrs. Varick always called her&#xD;
sister "Miss Tankerville."&#xD;
"I had heard so," said Ruse. '' It must have been very&#xD;
gratifying to him to find his cousin so comfortably arranged-&#xD;
nice silver-pretty curtains and all that!"&#xD;
" Ah ! that is the most diabolical satire, Rus6! You are too&#xD;
bad, eh ?" said Forrester, enjoying it evidently.&#xD;
"Well, for my part," said young Mrs. Varick, "had I been&#xD;
in Miss Tankeiville's place, I would not have asked Dr. Mannikin&#xD;
to stay on that occasion. It was just a little cut-I understand&#xD;
that-but I think it would have been more dignified in Miss&#xD;
Tankerville to take no notice of him."&#xD;
" I observed that you turned your back on him with a great&#xD;
deal of dignity," said Rus6.&#xD;
Everybody smiled. Mrs. Varick had the air of being about&#xD;
seventeen years old, she was petite, a piquant figure, the face&#xD;
of a doll, soft blue eyes, an innocent pouting girlish mouth:&#xD;
her turning her back with a great deal of dignity on anybody&#xD;
was a funny idea. Starting from that, Mrs. Varick was rallied&#xD;
a good deal, and the jests were sometimes alarmingly free.&#xD;
Boarding-house life is like that even in its most refined aspects.&#xD;
People become immensely familiar, and there is almost always&#xD;
some one who either by uncommon innocence, or by knowing&#xD;
too much, acts as a provocative to a species of wit which will&#xD;
not bear recording. Mrs. Varick was a rare instance of this&#xD;
kind : she never understood anything except in the most literal&#xD;
sense, repeated with bewilderment the sauciest equivoques and&#xD;
could not imagine why the gentlemen laughed. Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville contributed to the piquancy of the married lady's igno-&#xD;
rance by knowing everything, on the contrary : the contrast&#xD;
was an endless charm to students of character like Russ and&#xD;
Forrester. This was all very well so long as it was confined to&#xD;
these adroit foreigners and men of the world, but when Mr.&#xD;
Seymour, who fancied he had wit too, tried his hand, the&#xD;
hounds were harked off at once, for it was known by expe-&#xD;
rience that something quite terrible was coming.&#xD;
By way of diversion, every one indulged in the most start-&#xD;
ling criticism on the dishes, so that Rosemary felt extremely&#xD;
&#xD;
pained for Miss Tankerville till she perceived that that lady&#xD;
only laughed and said, answering her look of astonishment:-&#xD;
"Everybody here speaks out before everybody without regard&#xD;
to my feelings"--with the most unconcerned smile-" it is the&#xD;
wazy of the house."&#xD;
"We have to take it out in talking," said Rus6: "the dinner&#xD;
does not improve, say what we will."&#xD;
"Yes," said Forrester, "Miss Tankerville insists on boiling&#xD;
the mint sauce. I move we put it to vote whether that shall&#xD;
be endured any longer, merely because she thinks it correct."&#xD;
" Hot mint sauce ! Never heard of such a thing in my life&#xD;
before," said one.&#xD;
"Was that an idea of your cousin Dr. Mannikin's, Miss&#xD;
Helen ?" asked another.&#xD;
"It is absurd, I know," said Miss Tankerville, "but if you&#xD;
had not that to complain of, it would be something else."&#xD;
"She treats us like so many children," said Mr. O'Morra&#xD;
wickedly.   .&#xD;
" ga ira," said Rus6.&#xD;
"Make a graceful concession, Miss Helen," said Count&#xD;
Wissen. "Monarchs have lost their thrones by not yielding in&#xD;
time to the popular voice. Hot mint sauce-"&#xD;
. "Is against the sentiments of this enlightened community,"&#xD;
said Mr. Seymour.&#xD;
At last Miss Marid was appealed to, who was obliged to con-&#xD;
fess that to her it was a novelty, but then her experience was&#xD;
limited. This decision, and the disappearance of the lamb,&#xD;
sauce and all, finished the debate.&#xD;
In the midst of this clatter of tongues and dishes, Wissen&#xD;
continued to address a good many observations to the aston..&#xD;
shed Rosemary, under cover of the French language and in a&#xD;
low voice.&#xD;
"This is a gay society, Miss Rose.-if you will pardon me for&#xD;
calling you so."&#xD;
"Oh, very gay !" said Rosemary, laughing: "a little too&#xD;
much so for my quiet tastes. Does Madame d'Ehrenstein&#xD;
like it?"&#xD;
"She wishes to learn English," said Wissen. "Besides, you&#xD;

"I hope so," said Rosemary.&#xD;
" The dinner is excellent, after all," said the'count.&#xD;
"I suppose it is a very favorable specimen of boarding-&#xD;
house life."&#xD;
" Probably there is not another such family either in Brook-&#xD;
lyn or the metropolis."&#xD;
"Nothing would induce me to live so, but sheer necessity,"&#xD;
said Rosemary. "Why, M. le comte, think how I have been&#xD;
brought up ! How long would the fine bloom last, think you,'&#xD;
under such rude brushing ? I tremble to think of it."&#xD;
"What will you do ?"&#xD;
"Fly. I would rather live in a garret and dine on a crust&#xD;
than expose myself to such a danger. Fortunately there are&#xD;
convents."&#xD;
" I don't see the necessity of either alternative for you," said&#xD;
the count, lowering his tone. "A few days, I trust, will restore&#xD;
you to your home and rightful position. I saw your grand-&#xD;
parents.to-day."&#xD;
Rosemary turned pale, and listened.&#xD;
"They are dreadfully broken-especially your grandfather.&#xD;
Some discretion must be used in imparting to them the fact of&#xD;
your existence."f&#xD;
"I must talk to you about this by and by," said Rosemary.&#xD;
" How did grandmamma seem 1"&#xD;
"The same as ever, but older, sterner, more implacable-if&#xD;
I may say so."&#xD;
" Ah! there it is! ier vengeance for this will be dreadful.&#xD;
Grandpapa would spare-she will not. And on whom will her&#xD;
vengeance fall? On those who after all are my own blood.&#xD;
Dreadfully near-some of them ! Oh, Count Wissen, my&#xD;
father's friend ! you know not what discoveries I made in that&#xD;
terrible trance. I heard everything that passed, for I know&#xD;
not how long ! People spoke in the ear of the dead what for&#xD;
the world they would not have had known by the living !"&#xD;
"What steps have you taken since ?"&#xD;
" Written to my grandpapa Romarin-that is all. I shall do&#xD;

nothing further. till I hear from him--I have dismissed ever&#xD;
other question from my mind."&#xD;
"Allow me one more inquiry, though unjustifiable. My poor&#xD;
friend Flordal ?"&#xD;
"That is a perfectly permissible question, dear Count Wis-&#xD;
sen," said Rosemary, almost tenderly, and looking him straight&#xD;
in the face. "What has happened was a real Providence for&#xD;
Col. de Flordal and myself. The tie so nearly knit, is now and&#xD;
for ever impossible. Were my cousin Flordal the only man left&#xD;
in the world I would not marry him now."&#xD;
"We must change the theme-even in French it is not safe,&#xD;
with so many foreign ears about us. By-the-by we are all&#xD;
Republicans here, and you, I think, are a royalist."&#xD;
"An imperialist," said Rosemary.&#xD;
"Oh! then you believe in Louis Napoleon Bonaparte ?"&#xD;
"He is the greatest sovereign in Europe."&#xD;
"Lovely enthusiast 1"&#xD;
"Not at all, your Excellency :-I only say what 1 have&#xD;
always heard from others wiser than myself. The Emperor is&#xD;
a true son of the church."&#xD;
" Perhaps. He has hitherto found it convenient to concil-&#xD;
iate the church's support to his dynasty."&#xD;
"He restored the Pope, your Excellency."&#xD;
"And wrote the letter to Edgar Ney, Mademoiselle."&#xD;
"What letter was that ?" asked Rosemary.&#xD;
"One in-'which Louis Napoleon, then President, prescribed&#xD;
to the Pope whom he had restored, a programmae which annihi-&#xD;
lated the Papal sovereignty and justified the Revolution."&#xD;
"What did the Pope say to that ?"&#xD;
"He did not comply-he temporized, as Rome always does&#xD;
when she has to deal with wrongheaded emperors who wish to&#xD;
serve her against her will. But Napoleon has never retracted&#xD;
his letter."&#xD;
"What does your Excellency think of the government of&#xD;
Rome ?"&#xD;
"That depends entirely on one's point of view: you know&#xD;
that I am not a Catholic and that my government is a Protest-&#xD;
ant Power."&#xD;
&#xD;

358                   ROSEMARY.&#xD;
"That is why I take an interest in knowing your Excellency's&#xD;
opinion."&#xD;
"Without Rome, Mademoiselle, religious unity would dis-&#xD;
appear from Europe, and society would dissolve."&#xD;
"That is not answering my question, M. le comte."&#xD;
"You refer to the temporal government of the States of the&#xD;
Church ''&#xD;
" Yes: everybody abuses it: even Catholics apologize for it&#xD;
with timidity : you tell me that my favorite Emperor, Napoleon&#xD;
himself, who saved the Pope, wants it to be reformed."&#xD;
The count regarded her attentively, and with some surprise:&#xD;
he was not prepared for so much precision of thought in a&#xD;
young lady. Although the tone of the conversation was very&#xD;
quiet, by degrees everybody was listening ; even the pretty&#xD;
Mrs. Seymour, listening to Ernest Claviger's graphic account&#xD;
of a musical entertainment by the Philharmonic, was so dis-&#xD;
tracted that she replied in the most absurd manner.&#xD;
"A government is good relatively,,Mademoiselle. That of&#xD;
Rome taxes the people more lightly than any other in Europe;&#xD;
the people are happier, more moral, better fed, better clothed,&#xD;
suffer less from pauperism and misery, than the people of&#xD;
England; there is less crime than in the United States, the&#xD;
cities are better policed than here, the schools are at least as&#xD;
good, the universities are infinitely superior, the circulating&#xD;
medium is sounder, the system of business is safer, fortunes are&#xD;
more equal, and the pleasure of living is tenfold greater for&#xD;
every class of society, except for those who are discontented&#xD;
with the government."&#xD;
"Why are they discontented ?"&#xD;
"For the same reason that the gambler prefers the feverish&#xD;
excitement of play to the quiet pursuits of industry, or even to&#xD;
the easy disbursement of an hereditary fortune. The peoples&#xD;
have tasted the sweets of such a perilous game as modern&#xD;
commerce, on the credit system, offers to them, and they long&#xD;
to participate in it: they are thirsting for material enjoyments,&#xD;
noisy pleasures, wealth, luxury and power. The highest posts&#xD;
in the Roman States are given only to ecclesiastics, that is, to&#xD;
men who in great part have renounced the world, and who&#xD;
&#xD;
DINING WITH THE BOARDERS.     359&#xD;
&#xD;
cannot marry: the ambitious laity want a system-under which&#xD;
they can become ministers of State and foreign embassadors:&#xD;
voild tout."&#xD;
"It seems to me, Count, that the ambition you describe is&#xD;
not altogether culpable. I should not enjoy living in a country&#xD;
where my father or brother or (if you please) my husband, was&#xD;
excluded from the highest posts which are open to laymen in&#xD;
other States. It is a humiliating position."&#xD;
" Ah !" said the Count, "you are in favor of secularization."&#xD;
"What does your Excellency think of it ?"&#xD;
' Secularization would destroy the ecclesiastical principality,&#xD;
which is the keystone of society in Europe for more than a&#xD;
thousand years."&#xD;
"Then it would be a great evil."&#xD;
"Yes; if that society be worth preserving."&#xD;
"Louis Napoleon has 'saved society," said Rosemary,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"As a gendarme who runs a burglar through the body,&#xD;
saves your house from being broken into. I don't admit that&#xD;
the gendarme thereby acquires the right of pulling the house&#xD;
down about your ears."&#xD;
"I see that your Excellency does not like the Emperor of&#xD;
the French."&#xD;
"I distrust him."&#xD;
"I imbibed imperialism-not with my mother's milk," said&#xD;
Rosemary, smiling half mournfully-" for, alas ! I never tasted&#xD;
that sacred nourishment ; but in my earliest infancy."&#xD;
"As my young friend O'Morra has Republicanism," replied&#xD;
the sagacious Minister. "I must get you to convert him."&#xD;
"Oh, I have no talent that way, to say nothing of the imper-&#xD;
tinence," said Rosemary, suffering her dark eyes to be hidden&#xD;
under lids so beautiful, and fringed with such long brown&#xD;
lashes, that you would swear 'twas her loveliest expression.&#xD;
"I observe that you take a flattering interest in my young&#xD;
friend, after all," pursued the relentless Minister, with a mix-&#xD;
ture of admiration and jealousy.&#xD;
He is so handsome and I~ am only eighteen, your Excel-&#xD;
lency is aware," replied the young lady, lifting again her dark.&#xD;

bright eyes, with an expression so penetrating, so malicious&#xD;
almost, that the -diplomat felt himself ~foiled ; and whether it&#xD;
was innocence defending with native arms a guileless secret, or&#xD;
coquetry opening a masked battery in attack, he knew not.&#xD;
The address, not to say the dissimulation, of a girl of eighteen&#xD;
was on these points more than a match for the most ruse&#xD;
diplomatist: it was nature versus art.&#xD;
Almost every gentleman at the table had his own wine, and&#xD;
some of two sorts, an expensive item, especially as an old-&#xD;
fashioned custom seemed to exist of challenging the ladies.&#xD;
Rosemary soon had four or five little glasses of wine ranged&#xD;
about her plate, till Miss Tankerville. suggested to her that it&#xD;
was not necessary to accept further than by filling her glass?&#xD;
from any decanter she preferred, and Wissen, also with a smile&#xD;
at her inexperience, placed his sherry at her disposal. When&#xD;
the cloth was removed, Mr. O'Morra, senior, quietly gave her&#xD;
health, with a welcome on her first appearance in the family.&#xD;
As the party was now become very social, this toast was drank&#xD;
with all the honors, and Rosemary, recovering herself easily&#xD;
after the first confusion, requested Mr. Rory to return thanks&#xD;
for her, adding:&#xD;
"It is not the first time, Mr. Rory, that you are my knight."&#xD;
"I am delighted to hear that, my boy !" cried Mr. O'Morra,&#xD;
whose bitter blood flowed in a more genial current after a&#xD;
little good sherry.&#xD;
Rory was on his legs in a moment: a little cheer greeted&#xD;
him. It so.happened that he had never made an after-dinner&#xD;
speech in his life.&#xD;
"Ladies and gentlemen," said he.-All were silent as the&#xD;
grave.-" It is needless to say how-unequal I feel myself to the&#xD;
occasion (hear, hear ! from papa). A young lady whose first&#xD;
.        introduction into-our happy and friendly circle (hear, hear!)&#xD;
has been greeted by us all with-unparalleled but just enthu-&#xD;
siasm (cheers and little taps of fruit-knives on the mahogany),&#xD;
has selected me in spite of my-my youth and inexperience--&#xD;
(never mind your youth, Mr. Rory!) to return thanks in her&#xD;
name (good !). Her choice fills me with confusion (don't be&#xD;
afraid, Mr. Rory !), when I think how many others there are&#xD;
&#xD;
DINING WITH THE BOARDERS. -61,&#xD;
more capable of doing credit to it, being the youngest man at&#xD;
the table, I believe---.."&#xD;
" Say the youngest gentleman," corrected Mr. Seymour,&#xD;
nodding over his glass to the orator.&#xD;
"But when I think of the charming person I represent (a&#xD;
little quiver of the voice, scarcely perceptible), I must main-&#xD;
tain that she could not have chosen more wisely ; for it is not&#xD;
the merit of the representative that you are to regard, but the&#xD;
merit of the person represented." (Hear, hear ! with great&#xD;
vivacity.)&#xD;
Miss Mari interposed-women always interrupt in these&#xD;
cases-by saying: "When you speak in my name, Mr. Rory,&#xD;
you ought not to spear; in my praise."' Her cheek was scarlet.&#xD;
"I am desired not to praise my fair principal," resumed&#xD;
Rory, with a profound bow to tle interrupter ; "although I&#xD;
believe that an ambassador (his Excellency C6ant Wissen will&#xD;
correct me if I am wrong) is always at liberty to extol the vir-&#xD;
tues of his sovereign"-(" Really, the boy is making an excel-&#xD;
lent speech !" said papa, glancing round the table). "But as&#xD;
obedience is the first duty of a subject, I shall not enlarge&#xD;
upon what is so obvious to us all. Miss Marid, ladies and gen-&#xD;
tlemen, thanks you for the very obliging manner in which you&#xD;

who, under the graceful presidency of our excellent Miss Tan-&#xD;

welcome in the saie spirit in which you offer it ; she will con-.&#xD;
sider herself henceforth at home here, as we are (Exactly!);&#xD;
and I will venture still further to interpret her wishes by giving&#xD;
in return the health of Miss Tankerville." (Uproarious applause&#xD;
n which Rosemary joins, playfully clapping her white hands).&#xD;
Miss Tankerville waited for the toast to be drank, and then&#xD;
rose. As soon . as the folding-doors were closed upon the&#xD;
ladies, Mr. O'Morra said :-" Well, Count, what is your opinion&#xD;

"I would prefer to hear that of some one else, as I own I am&#xD;
quite dazzled," said M. de Wissen, lighting a cigar.&#xD;
" It was remarked by Mrs. Seymour," said that lady's hus-&#xD;
band, rather solemnly,-" and I think that my wife's opinion&#xD;
in regard to her own sex is almost invariably correct-that&#xD;
Miss Marie seemed used to gentlemen's society, and-as Mrs.&#xD;
Seymour also remarked-to the society of highly cultivated&#xD;
gentlemen. For example, she had no difficulty in conversing&#xD;
with Count Wissen on topics that few ladies are capable of&#xD;
handling, and especially young girls of Miss Marie's age."&#xD;
Forrester mumbled over his wine that Miss Maris did not&#xD;
strike him as used to gentlemen's society, but as used to the&#xD;
society of Count Wissen; but the kynness of this observation&#xD;
was lost in the extreme rl.lowness of its delivery. Ernest&#xD;
Claviger-a young English merchant, fair, ingenuous and&#xD;
pleasing-opmnng his blue eyes very wide, and speaking, like a&#xD;
young Englishman, with vast hesitation, but wholly unembar-&#xD;
r.ssed, and with many an " Aw" and " a-a-a," thought that&#xD;
Miss Mari6 was-" a-a-a-not exactly used-aw-to society"-&#xD;
Ernest was very current in the local tip-top circle of the Brook-&#xD;
lyn suburb-" he thought not-a-but-aw-in short, a very,&#xD;
very beautiful girl, no doubt !'-with an air of profound con-&#xD;
viction. Mr. Rus6 criticised her extreme self-possession: he&#xD;
liked to see young girls more bashful and timid-" teemeed,"&#xD;
as he pronounced it.-" American girls were all so"-Mr. Ruse&#xD;
did not finish the sentence, but left you to infer that in his&#xD;
opinion the young females of this country were quite deficient&#xD;
in a certain retiring modesty.&#xD;
"Her manners are perfectly charming, upon my word ! Pass&#xD;
the port to the count, Rory. What a carriage ! graceful as a&#xD;
floating swan !" said the elder O'Morra, sipping his port.&#xD;
"Timidity is a very good thing in its way, Ruse6; but the most&#xD;
timid, retiring manners I ever saw in a woman were those of a&#xD;
lady whom I prosecuted for poisoning her husband. Pr.&#xD;
Galenson says nothing V"&#xD;
"I have paid my last visit," said Galenson, smiling, "and&#xD;
feel too sentimental and melancholy to hazard any observation."&#xD;
Galenson, in fact, had been quite transformed in the course&#xD;
&#xD;

of his attendance on Miss Marie6: he was no longer the same&#xD;
jolly fellow,&#xD;
"I hope Miss Mari has paid you well doctor ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Seymour.&#xD;
"Generously..-like a princess!" said Galenson,with some&#xD;
emotion,&#xD;
"Got lots of tin," mumbled Forrester, in the same inexpres-&#xD;
sibly juicy tone as before. "Jewels and lace and moi-e anti&#xD;
and plenty of bank-notes, and knows these foweign counts like&#xD;
her pa and ma !"&#xD;
"And how goes sculpture, Mr. Rory ?" inquired Wissen,&#xD;
willing to change a topic not too agreeable to himself, and&#xD;
very disagreeable, he perceived, to his young friend.&#xD;
"Oh, you have not heard of Mr. Rory's grand success at the&#xD;
Exhibition ?" asked Ruse, who still dabbled in newspapers.&#xD;
" Mr. Rory has had a grand success ' That's excellenta..-.a&#xD;
glass of port upon that, Mr. O'Morra."&#xD;
Papa fidgeted.&#xD;
"The finest bust exhibited this year-a most lovely thing-..&#xD;
the drapery so elegant yet so simple !"&#xD;
"Mrs. Seymour says the features are very much like Miss&#xD;
Marid," observed Mr. S.&#xD;
" That eternal Miss Marie !" said Rus6, in an undertone.&#xD;
" Infwe-nal Miss Mawid !" mumbled Forrester, more and more&#xD;
indistinctly.&#xD;
"It is quite the topic among the artists," said Ernest Claviger&#xD;
who knew all Bohemia, and prided himself greatly .thereon&#xD;
"The drapery,. as Rus6 says, is, exquisite."&#xD;
"The d.wapewy," said Forrester, who- knew more about art&#xD;
than all the company, except young O'Morra, and kindling up&#xD;
to hear such a false criticism--" th dwapewy is--no account&#xD;
Wat makes the dwapewy so pwetty Is the fwawm--the fwawm,&#xD;
I say-modelled unde-w-it. Dwapewy !"&#xD;
Ernest Claviger undertook to describe the bust, which was&#xD;
called "The Bride," 'and had attracted universal admiration,&#xD;
as well as created some perplexity. . The head, it seemed, per-&#xD;
fectly classic and noble, was attired in a veil of point lace&#xD;
exquisitely imitated, with a wreath of flowers finely treated.:&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6853-00000184"/>&#xD;
DINING WITH THE BOARDERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
The veil flowed back, the light texture wandering over hair&#xD;
and pendant flowers and the sloping shoulder. In front the&#xD;
bust and so much as was included of the large arms, were&#xD;
covered with a vesture of absolute simplicity, of a texture that&#xD;
was perfectly pliant to the shape, among the soft Folds of&#xD;
which hung a large polished medal confined by a ribbon. The&#xD;
ornate treatment of the head and the breadth and simplicity of&#xD;
the bust, made an admired contrast.&#xD;
"I must see it," said the count.&#xD;
Meanwhile the ladies had mostly dispersed to their several&#xD;
rooms. Miss Mari6 remained to chat with Madame d'Ehren-&#xD;
stein. The countess had sat at the other end of Miss Tankerville's&#xD;
long table, so that she could not in the general hubbub of&#xD;
foreign tongues around her distinguish what passed between&#xD;
M. de Wissen and the beautiful stranger, but she was too&#xD;
practised not to detect that this was not their first acquaintance,&#xD;
in spite of the Minister's formal bow and the young lady's&#xD;
ceremonious inclination when they met. This quickening her&#xD;
memory, enabled her to recall what Mlle. Angelique was the&#xD;
first, with a child's promptitude, to point out.&#xD;
" Chire maman ! it is the young lady of the fine carriage,&#xD;
who met the pretty young lady of the rail-car, that M. de&#xD;
Wissen and M. de Flordal so much admired."&#xD;
"Thou art right," said her mother. "But say thou nothing,&#xD;
child. We shall see."&#xD;
In her own country, at hotels, watering-places and so fortf,&#xD;
Madame d'Ehrenstein was used to fight shy of all agreeable&#xD;
and anonymous female strangers. Neither fine dress, nor&#xD;
jewels, nor finer manners, made the least impression on her ; she&#xD;
had seen all that in the most desperate adventuresses. Even&#xD;
youth and beauty were no criterion in her experienced eyes.&#xD;
But apart from the guarantee of M. de Wissen, there was a&#xD;
mysterious cachet-a stamp of genuine and candid maidenhood&#xD;
--the spotless lily seal on the brow and in the smile of Rose&#xD;
Marie, that no woman could be deceived in. So Madame&#xD;
d'Ehrenstein, cautious and vigilant, and unsparing in her&#xD;
notions of birth and breeding, who would not allow Mlle.&#xD;
Angelique to form any intimacies with Miss Tankerville's&#xD;
&#xD;
boarders, took her old-fashioned German knitting, while Miss&#xD;
Marid busied herself with some crochet,-a real woman's&#xD;
fingers, no matter what her rank, are never idle-and let&#xD;
Angelique nestle by the young lady's side, and accept an invi-&#xD;
tation to visit her room, and gossiped into a violent intimacy&#xD;
in comparing America with Europe. Rosemary liked the&#xD;
plain, shrewd, motherly but withal high-bred and haughty&#xD;
countess very much ; the presence of such a person in the&#xD;
family made her feel at home ; there was a protection in it&#xD;
which no one else certainly-not the vivacious Miss Tanker-&#xD;
ville, not the baby Mrs. Varick, not the penetrating Mrs.&#xD;
Seymour-could supply ; a woman of the world, whose expe-&#xD;
rience could judge her conduct; a woman of rank and repute,&#xD;
whose word would vouch for it: she thought she might safely&#xD;
remain where she was, while Madame d'Ehrenstein stayed, and&#xD;
abandoned the idea of escaping to a convent.&#xD;

CONCERNING SCULPTURE.        367&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
CONCERNING SCULPTURE.&#xD;
WIsSEN went the next day to the Exhibition of the National&#xD;
Academy of Design. It was a good Exhibition, very rich in&#xD;
landscape, and adorned by many a little gem beside, from&#xD;
artists then obscure, who have since become famous. 'The&#xD;
Minister had paid little attention to the progress of the Fine&#xD;
Arts in this new country, and he wandered through the rooms&#xD;
looking at the pictures that interested him, and feeling that&#xD;
America would not long be behind Europe in an order of&#xD;
production to which republics have always been favorable.&#xD;
However, he perceived yet some immense gaps to be filled.&#xD;
An idealism too conventional and essentially copyist, seemed&#xD;
to contend with an exaggerated naturalism. American art&#xD;
appeared to him yet to lack that inspiration higher than itself,&#xD;
which in other times and countries had been the true origin&#xD;
of its prodigies. At last he came quite suddenly upon a bust&#xD;
in white marble, around which a number of ladies had ga-&#xD;
thered. A glance revealed the secret of its fascination.&#xD;
"This resembles Rose Dashon," thought the Minister, "and&#xD;
yet it is not a portrait."&#xD;
In fact, the spirit and general character of Rosemary's face&#xD;
and head were there, without anything individual; the veil,&#xD;
the flowers, were finely generalized; the face itself was solemn,&#xD;
beautiful, serene, with a certain immobility and fixedness of.&#xD;
expression-an expression that ought not to change, and which&#xD;
therefore most exactly suited the changeless marble. It was&#xD;
rightly named "The Marble Bride," which Wissen found to be&#xD;
the title in the catalogue. This noble, calm, impassive head&#xD;
was slightly bent over a neck and bosom of truly wonderful&#xD;
&#xD;
modelling ; and Wissen comprehended then that the sculptor&#xD;
has an eye in his hand, that like the blind, he discerns form&#xD;
by the touch, and remembers the impression more vividly than&#xD;
we the impressions of sight. Here was no reminiscence of the&#xD;
antique, no voluptuous fancy, no meretricious naturalistic&#xD;
display. You saw nothing but a soft robe, with folds of an&#xD;
infinite modesty. It seemed that another sense might make&#xD;
further discoveries; but that maidenly majesty awed you too&#xD;
much to dream of making the experiment. It was clearly an&#xD;
inspiration. Wissen passed an hour looking at it, and there&#xD;
were always persons looking, chiefly women. Some gazed in&#xD;
silence ; 'others tried to express delight, admiring this and&#xD;
that; few, if any, seeming to know what it was that charmed&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Quitting the Exhibition, full of thought and convinced that&#xD;
his friend was a genius, Wissen rather sadly entered an omnibus&#xD;
to pay a visit which he felt to be of obligation. The omnibus&#xD;
circulated through a splendid Avenue, and was filled with ele-&#xD;
gantly dressed ladies. At Madam Dashon's the count pulled&#xD;
the check and got out, followed by at least eight pair of spark-&#xD;
ling eyes, rendered more curious by his profoundly abstracted&#xD;
air. He was admitted at once, and shown into the blue-room,&#xD;
where grandmamma Dashon did not keep him long waiting.&#xD;
She was gratified by his call, and much more cordial than when&#xD;
they met on the ferry. She soon recurred to the subject upper-&#xD;
most in her thoughts.&#xD;
"When my son died-you knew my son, Count Wissen ?-I&#xD;
thought it a terrible blow ; but it was nothing to this. He was&#xD;
a soldier-I knew that he was exposing his life every day-he&#xD;
lost it in a glorious action-a glorious action, do you under-&#xD;
stand ?-shedding lustre on the name of Dashon. Then he&#xD;
left this child. - It was only a girl, but our blood was in her&#xD;
veins, and such a girl!  You knew my grandchild, Count&#xD;
Wissen. I cannot remember that she ever committed a wilful&#xD;
fault. She was thoughtless sometimes, and full of her fun&#xD;
when we were alone, but so scrupulously conscientious-do&#xD;
you understand? She seemed cold to strangers, but that was&#xD;
her exquisite modesty. She was really the most affectionate&#xD;

creature in the world. A heart, M. le come :-it is not every&#xD;
one that has a heart, do you understand ? There's my niece&#xD;
Augusta. Varick : a very handsome girl, no doubt, and ex-&#xD;
tremely caressing in her manners ; she embraces me twice to&#xD;
Rosemary's once, do you understand ?-yet she has no heart at&#xD;
all ! absolutely none ! ian anything be more frightful than&#xD;
what has befallen poor Mr. Dashon, count ? Were he able, he&#xD;
would alter his will. I am certain of it. He would leave&#xD;
everything to me, do you understand ? with a discretion as to&#xD;
his nephew and niece ; but he is incapable of making a testa-&#xD;
mentary disposition-thus half his property goes straight to my&#xD;
niece Mrs. Varick, Augusta's mother, you understand? She&#xD;
wants the whole of it. I often wonder she is not tempted to&#xD;
put me out of the way"-with her short, bitter laugh ;-" for&#xD;
if I die before Mr. Dashon, -all will be hers ; and assuredly, if&#xD;
I survive him, not a penny will she get beyond her legal share&#xD;
-half his immense estate. It is the real reason, count,"-&#xD;
sinking her voice to a whisper and laying one yet unwrinkled&#xD;
hand on his arm-" it is the real reason why I keep Augusta&#xD;
here, and pretend to form plans for her-to blind her mother&#xD;
as to my intentions. She wants me to take the girl to France,&#xD;
and marry her to your friend Floreal; and I persuade them&#xD;
that I mean to do it as soon as we have left off our mourning,&#xD;
eh ? She wanted the Empress's pearls, too ! But I was too&#xD;
sharp for her there !"&#xD;
"What cause did the physicians assign for the sudden decease&#xD;
of Miss Dashon ?" inquired the count.&#xD;
" Disease of the heart-that is, they knew nothing about it,&#xD;
do you understand ? Why, she never was sick a day in her&#xD;
life, since she lived with us! Her health was perfect--her&#xD;
sleep was like an infant's-a faultless machine, do you under-&#xD;
stand ? always running well, and never out of order. There is&#xD;
no explaining such a catastrophe, sir, in such a creature."&#xD;
" Has the thought ever occurred to you, madam," pursued&#xD;
Wissen, " that the sudden death of Miss Dashon might be&#xD;
attributed-to such a cause as you just now hinted at 'n&#xD;
"«To poison ?" asked the old lady, calmly. '&#xD;
" Pardon the suggestion."&#xD;
&#xD;
"The doctors said that no poison could produce a death so&#xD;
sudden and so tranquil, and yet leave no trace--do you&#xD;
understand ?"&#xD;
"There was no post-mortem ?"&#xD;
" Ah !" shrieked the old lady, "do you think I would&#xD;
have suffered such a profanation? No, no; no one touched&#xD;
her but her friends the Athertons, who lifted her from the floor&#xD;
to the bed, and from the bed to the coffin. -Besides, count, I&#xD;
never gave up hope till the last minute, that it was only a&#xD;
trance, and that she would come to life again. Until Mrs.&#xD;
Atherton closed her eyes, they continued to sparkle with the&#xD;
same brilliancy and expressiveness as in life ;-my brother&#xD;
Varick says that is a symptom of poisoning by certain nar-&#xD;
cotics-the eye glitters after death, do you understand? But&#xD;
suppose she were poisoned, would an examination bring her&#xD;
to life again? Answer me that? What then? That is all&#xD;
very well when some poor low-bred wretch comes to her end&#xD;
by unfair means, but it is not to be thought of in a family like&#xD;
ours. If my grandchild died of poison, Count Wissen, it must&#xD;
have been administered either by herself or some other. If&#xD;
by herself (impossible supposition), God forbid it should ever&#xD;
be known; if by another, that other in all probability would be&#xD;
one of the family, do you understand? Why pile disgrace on&#xD;
misfortune? My granddaughter herself, were she alive, would&#xD;
feel the same, count. She would let the iron enter into her&#xD;
very soul, and not a single cry would she utter if it was to&#xD;
bring dishonor on our house and name ! I have brought her&#xD;
up to that, and that old Louis, her French grandfather, laid the&#xD;
foundation well for my teaching."&#xD;
"But to act thus," said the count, feeling how truly the old&#xD;
lady had divined her grandchild's character,-" to act thus is&#xD;
to let the guilty go unpunished."&#xD;
"There are other punishments besides hanging," said grand-&#xD;
mamma, quietly, "and not less terrible ; and in families like&#xD;
ours we know how to inflict them. Do you take snuff, .f. le&#xD;
ministre ?"-offering her box.&#xD;
"Thank you, madam.--Rosemary is right," thought he,&#xD;

&#xD;
theree is no telling whither the old lady's vindictiveness would&#xD;
lead her, if she knew all."&#xD;
He was about to take leave. Grandmamma insisted on&#xD;
showing him the portrait of Rosemary. It had been painted in&#xD;
the autumn by Ingham, who had painted Rosemary's mother&#xD;
twenty years before, and was one of his most exquisite works,&#xD;
finished with the precision of a miniature. It hung in the&#xD;
library, where Mr. Dashon almost constantly sat, regarding it&#xD;
mournfully. He was there when the count entered, but took&#xD;
no notice of the interruption. There was an artist in the&#xD;
room, with his easelmaking a copy.&#xD;
" Mr. Dashon wiliiot allow this picture out of his sight, you&#xD;
understand ? So we have this copy made for the use of a&#xD;
sculptor who is making the statue for the monument," said&#xD;
grandmamma. "SHe is a celebrated man, and has modelled&#xD;
several figures already, but they are not likenesses at all, do&#xD;
you understand? I wish I could find a sculptor-there are&#xD;
many painters, for 'example-who had seen my grandchild&#xD;
alive."&#xD;
Ingham's -picture was a living likeness, but it did not give&#xD;
the profile at all, and that was the most peculiar and noblest&#xD;
view of'rosemary's face.-" They all fail there," said grand-&#xD;
mamma.&#xD;
Wissen then spoke of the head in the Exhibition. He was,&#xD;
convinced, he said, that young O'Morra must have seen Miss&#xD;
Dashon, for there was an extraordinary resemblance. Grand-&#xD;
mamma was vividly interested, promised to visit the Exhibition,&#xD;
-" I go nowhere now, do you understand ?"-and took down&#xD;
the artist's name and address.&#xD;
" O'Morra !" she repeated. "An Irishman, of course-saw&#xD;
my grandchild at church, no doubt. Ah ! she was always at&#xD;
her prayers-it was her only fault, you understand ?"&#xD;
" In a young woman we can excuse it," said the imperturbable&#xD;
Minister.&#xD;
"Certainly; above all, when she is destined to be a marquise,"&#xD;
said Madame, always faithful to her principles. " O'Morra!&#xD;
There is a lawyer of that name, who was formerly Attorney,&#xD;
or something, of the State, and prosecuted some great lady for&#xD;
&#xD;
poisoning her husband-ha! ha !"-the short laugh again...&#xD;
"I J read his speech-bitter as wornwood! Had I been the&#xD;
woman, I would rather have been hanged at once than torn to&#xD;
pieces by that merciless tongue-ha! ha !"&#xD;
" The sculptor is his son," said Count Wissen,&#xD;
" I will see his work this very day," said grandmamma; "for&#xD;
the father is a man of prodigious talent."&#xD;
At an earlier hour than usual that day was the mournful&#xD;
ceremony of getting old Mr. Dashon into his carriage. 'Instead&#xD;
of his granddaughter who used, to aid him with her strong&#xD;
young arm, two servants propped him, one on either side, and&#xD;
with slow and painful, steps he half walked, was half carried&#xD;
down the low gradini of his palace, and across the. broad&#xD;
sidewalk. Into the carriage it was necessary to lift him by&#xD;
main strength. Daily did the passers-by stop to moralize on&#xD;
the vanity of wealth, when they saw the lord of this magnifi-&#xD;
cent mansion thus helplessly infirm, and beheld his family,&#xD;
servants, carriage--all invested with the signs of hopeless&#xD;
mourning. The promenaders of the district, who knew the&#xD;
history, could add many a pathetic circumstance to deepen the&#xD;
tragedy. From  the windows of the mansion opposite, this&#xD;
spectacle was daily watched by Mrs. Isabel Varick, also clothed&#xD;
in weeds. Affectionate niece ! Her anxiety for her uncle's&#xD;
health was doubtless very real, or she would sometimes have&#xD;
missed her station at the varying hours of that daily drive;&#xD;
but she never did. As sure as the coach was at the door, Mrs.&#xD;
Varick was at her window; and when it drove off, if she caught&#xD;
the eye of her aunt, she would kiss her hand. Then she drove&#xD;
out herself, alone, or accompanied by her son ; but the time&#xD;
was exactly calculated, and long before the carriage returned&#xD;
from Greenwood Mrs. Varick was at her station again, and as&#xD;
Johnson drove ups he always looked at the window, with its&#xD;
rich columns without, and superb curtains within, where the&#xD;
lady stood, and gave his whip a knowing flourish, and touched&#xD;
his black livery hat.&#xD;
That day the first stop was at the exhibition of the Academy.&#xD;
Augusta wished to get out too, but her aunt obliged her to&#xD;
remain in the carriage to keep her uncle company. This was&#xD;

RONCERNfNG SOULPTURE.         378&#xD;
&#xD;
one reason why Augusta was always of the party. As grand..&#xD;
mamma did not like to leave Mr. Dashon alone in the&#xD;
carriage, lest something might befall, the young lady was&#xD;
useful, sometimes to remain with her uncle when Mrs. Dashon&#xD;
wished to alight, oftener to get out on some errand (as the old&#xD;
lady never failed to have one); so that her situation, however&#xD;
honorable and full of prospective wealth and independence,&#xD;
was by no means a sinecure. And that day Aunt Dashon was&#xD;
gone an unconscionable time, and returned with signs of deep&#xD;
emotion on her severe countenance. She immediately gave&#xD;
the order-not a usual one-" Wall street Ferry." Unless Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon had occasion to visit her banker or lawyer, she usually&#xD;
drove straight to the Hamilton Ferry at the foot of Whitehall.&#xD;
Arrived on the Brooklyn side she gave another puzzling&#xD;
order  . "Pacific street, between Clinton and Court." Ha4&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon known Brooklyn-better, she would have taken&#xD;
the South Ferry.&#xD;
It was a pleasant street, shaded with trees; on one side-a&#xD;
row of quiet two-story houses ; on the other, gardens enclosed&#xD;
by a fence. On the garden side, about the middle of the&#xD;
square, stood a single building of . peculiar appearance,&#xD;
evidently not a dwelling house, two storied, with narrow win-&#xD;
dows below, and great square ones above. A young man was&#xD;
just coming out of the large plain door. Mrs. Dashon pulled&#xD;
the check-string, and the carriage stopped. She beckoned to&#xD;
the young man, who civilly approached the carriage.&#xD;
"Will you be so obliging, sir, as to tell me where is the&#xD;
studio of Mr. O'Morra, the sculptor-if you know V'&#xD;
"My name is O'Morra, madam, and sculpture is my profes-&#xD;
sion," replied the youth.&#xD;
Grandmanma looked much surprised, expecting to see an&#xD;
older man. Augusta says in a whisper-&#xD;
"Aunty, it is the gentleman whose horse Johnson cut yes-&#xD;
terday, and who was so polite !"&#xD;
"Is it ?" said grandmamma. "Johnson! take off your hat,&#xD;
sir. Allow me to apologize, Mr. O'Morra, for the rudeness of'&#xD;
my servant, for which I have already rebuked him severely,-&#xD;
do you understand ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Madam !" said Rory, with vivacity, "I trust you have not&#xD;
thought it necessary to hunt me up, to apologize for what I&#xD;
had entirely forgotten. Pray, replace your hat, Mr. Johnson."&#xD;
It was time; for Mr. Johnson's bald pate was broiling in the&#xD;
sun, as a foretaste of what he might expect hereafter,&#xD;
"if you are at leisure, Mr. O'Morra, I called on you for&#xD;
quite a different purpose. But I see you are just going out."&#xD;
"I am quite at your service, madam," says Rory, "either&#xD;
here, or in my, studio, if you choose to alight."&#xD;
"If you will excuse an old lady, I will despatch my business&#xD;
here, Mr. O'Morra; but in that case you must not stand.&#xD;
Augusta, take that basket on your lap and make room for Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra."&#xD;
Augusta blushed vividly; Mr. Rory was too gallant not to&#xD;
profit by the opportunity of sitting so near a young -lady of&#xD;
very considerable beauty. He smiled, took the proffered seat,&#xD;
and placed himself in an attitude of serious attention. He&#xD;
remembered Johnson perfectly; Mrs. Dashon, Augusta, and&#xD;
grandpapa, the two former disguised by their deep mourning,&#xD;
and the latter changed by illness, he would probably not have&#xD;
identified but for their coachman ; but this recognition had&#xD;
taken place the day before, when he glanced at the fellow&#xD;
who cut his horse ; for at that moment had it rushed upon his&#xD;
mind like lightning that these were the parents of Rosemary.&#xD;
"I had a granddaughter, Mr. O'Morra," said Mrs. Dashon.&#xD;
Grandpapa awoke from a kind of doze and looked around,&#xD;
fixing his tremulous gaze at last upon the young man.&#xD;
Rory bowed.&#xD;
"Did you ever see her ?" pursued grandmamma, regarding&#xD;
him with her eagle glance ;-we use the term advisedly, for&#xD;
grandmamma's glance of inquisition was sidelong, one-eyed,&#xD;
yet keen and steady, for all the world like a bird of prey.&#xD;
"I had the honor once to accompany her home from church,&#xD;
when she was accidentally belated," said the young man.&#xD;
" Ah," said grandmamma, "I remember it."&#xD;
The recollection affected the old lady ; she wept ; old Mr.&#xD;
Dashon also began to weep, not knowing why, and put forth&#xD;
his palsied hand to O'Morra ; it was something about Rose ; he&#xD;
&#xD;

clasped the young man's hand, and Rory could not without&#xD;
ungentle violence withdraw it.&#xD;
"Never mind," said grandmamma. "Is that the only occa-&#xD;
sion, Mr. O'Mor a, of your seeing my grandchild ?"&#xD;
This question uzzled Mr. Rory extremely. He slightly hesi-&#xD;
tated ; the sidelo g eye was upon him, sharp through wet.&#xD;
"To tell the truth, madam," said he, "I scarcely saw her&#xD;
face even then, so that I am sure I should not have known her&#xD;
again, had we happened to meet'&#xD;
"I do not quite understand, Mr. O'Morra, whether you ever&#xD;
did meet again, or not."&#xD;
"To the best of my knowledge and belief, madam," replied&#xD;
Mr. Rory, "I never saw your granddaughter again till she lay&#xD;
in her coffin."&#xD;
" Ah ! you attended the funeral !" said grandmamma.&#xD;
"Mr. O'Morra is a class-mate and friend of Roosey's, aunty,"&#xD;
said Augusta.&#xD;
Here Mr. Dashon drew back his hand, as if something hurt&#xD;
him, and murmured unintelligibly.&#xD;
"Pardon my questions, sir-they are not prompted by mere&#xD;
curiosity, you understand," pursued Mrs. Dashon. "There is&#xD;
a bust in the Exhibition, Mr. O'Morra, executed by you. I&#xD;
learn from the respectable janitress, do you understand ? that&#xD;
it is not for sale ; that you have instructed her to say in answer&#xD;
to the numberless applications, that money will not buy it.&#xD;
Well, young sir, I have no objection to that ; on the contrary; I&#xD;
should have been deeply wounded if such a work had been&#xD;
sold to any one ; but I expect that you will make an exception&#xD;
in my favor-in our favor, do you understand ?"-glancing at&#xD;
Mr. Dashon.-" I wish to become the purchaser, and desire&#xD;
you to name any price you please."&#xD;
"I cannot sell that bust, madam," replied Mr. Rory, rather&#xD;
haughtily. " But' -with a softened expression, that gave to&#xD;
his noble features an irresistible sweetness-" I will make you&#xD;
a copy for nothing-since you seem to set a particular value&#xD;
on it."&#xD;
Augusta looked at the young man as if she could scarcely&#xD;
refrain from embracing him; which was pardonable under the&#xD;
&#xD;
circumstances, for if ever a man looked like an angel, it was&#xD;
Rory O'Morra in saying those words. Old Mrs. Dashon was&#xD;
also touched.&#xD;
"It shall be as you please, sir. But that is not my real&#xD;
errand with you, after all. We are getting up a. monument to&#xD;
my grandchild, do you understand ? The principal figure must&#xD;
be herself, in her last moments, kneeling at her prie-dieu.&#xD;
Nobody can do it but'you, sir. Will you accept the commis-&#xD;
sion, naming your own terms ?"&#xD;
O'Morra was thunderstruck at this proposition to execute a&#xD;
monumental statue of a person whom he knew to be living. To&#xD;
render the affair still more strange, he actually did not know&#xD;
the names of the parties applying, or of the supposed deceased.&#xD;
He politely suggested the latter circumstance, which seemed&#xD;
to astonish grandmamma very much. She immediately gave&#xD;
him her card, and wrote on it the name of her granddaughter&#xD;
in full :-" RosE MARIE DASHON."&#xD;
" If I undertake any part of the monument," said he, "I&#xD;
must do the whole."&#xD;
"I put it entirely in your hands, regardless of expense."&#xD;
"Still I must have yopr general notions, both of the style&#xD;
and cost," said O'Morra.&#xD;
"Why can't you drive out with us to Greenwood, look at the&#xD;
situation of our lot, determine its capabilities, and send us in&#xD;
as early as possible, a plan ,with an estimate ?" said grand-&#xD;
mamma.&#xD;
"If you will excuse me," said Rory, "I will go on horse-&#xD;
back. It is the hour of my daily ride, and unless yourequipage&#xD;
is very fleet, I shall be there before you."&#xD;
In fact, he passed them on the road, for _Rory O'Morra's&#xD;
horse was a 2:46 trotter. He passed them like the wind; and&#xD;
in the meantime he had made a rapid, breathless call on Rose&#xD;
Marie, who did not hesitate to receive Mr. Rory O'Morra alone&#xD;
in Miss Tankerville's drawing-room. Whatever was the nature&#xD;
of their interview, Rory accepted Mrs. Dashon's commission ;&#xD;
inspected the burial lot, a charming wooded knoll, commanding&#xD;
the loveliest view in Greenwood, and having the vault below in&#xD;
the side of the acclivity, where the road wound by. With the&#xD;

876                   1tOsEMARVY.&#xD;
&#xD;
rapid glance of genius and experience he sketched on the&#xD;
spot a rude outline of a plan. Grandmamma assented to every&#xD;
thing he proposed. A thing that interested him greatly was&#xD;
that the grandparents had succeeded in getting their lot conse-&#xD;
crated, on certain conditions :-it was the only one in the&#xD;
cemetery. What will not wealth accomplish ? In a certain&#xD;
sense, the keys of Heaven itself seem to be at its disposal.&#xD;
Mr. Rory advised a very considerable departure from Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon's original idea of the monument. He considered the&#xD;
kneeling figure rather commonplace. There should be a&#xD;
chapel, a miniature chapel, quite enclosed except the entrance,&#xD;
which also might be closed by a glass door, so as to protect&#xD;
the statuary from the elements. Within he proposed an open&#xD;
sarcophagus with Christian emblems, and the figure of the&#xD;
deceased sitting on its edge, as if just risen from the last&#xD;
repose. The bridal attire-the coronal of flowers-would be&#xD;
all appropriate.&#xD;
"There is one thing, however, young sir, which I do not yet&#xD;
comprehend," said grandmamma, lingering a moment after the&#xD;
rest, and confronting the young sculptor.&#xD;
"And that is, madam ?"       ,&#xD;
"The manner in which you have draped what appears of the&#xD;
figure in your beautiful work in the Exhibition. My grand-&#xD;
child wore from earliest infancy such a robe, but-how 4id&#xD;
you know that, young gentleman ?"&#xD;
"It is a classic vesture," said O'Morra, quietly: "in fidct,&#xD;
my dear :ndam,"-with a subtle smile-" it is drapery r the&#xD;
abstract."&#xD;
"Ah ! drapery in the abstract ! And the medal, monsieur ?"&#xD;
said grandmamma. "Is that also in the abstract ?"&#xD;
"I wear one like it myself," said O'Morra, drawing it from&#xD;
his bosom.&#xD;
"It is a pity you did not know her in life," said grandmamma.&#xD;
"You would have suited each other, do you understand? And&#xD;
she might still be ours-who knows ?"&#xD;
O'Morra turned pale, but said nothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
A DRIVE TO GREENWOOD.&#xD;
ROSEMARY was an early bird. To date from her appearance&#xD;
at dinner which attested a complete recovery, she resumed her&#xD;
matin walks. Out of the house by six, breathing the fresh air&#xD;
on the heights, or making her way to the hill overlooking&#xD;
Gowanus Bay, where Mary, the Star of the Sea, greets the&#xD;
mariner from afar, and performing her devotions in the church,&#xD;
unknown by any present, she returned to an eight o'clock&#xD;
breakfast, with that portion of the family who were sufficiently&#xD;
early to share it.&#xD;
Mr. Rory O'Morra was earlier still. He quitted the house a&#xD;
full hour before Rosemary, who soon learned to distinguish his&#xD;
step on the stair, and sometimes in returning she got a glimpse&#xD;
of him at a distance striding homeward at a tremendous rate&#xD;
and the breakfast conversation developed the fact that he&#xD;
exercised at the gymnasium a couple of hours every morning.&#xD;
At all events the young gentleman was commonly a few&#xD;
minutes late at breakfast, where he appeared most singularly&#xD;
fresh, in all the glory of spotless linen and a young man's&#xD;
matin gear. If there was anything about O'Morra that smacked&#xD;
of the puppy age, it was the extreme finish and appropriate-&#xD;
ness of his toilet on all occasions: but then that might be&#xD;
habit, for his father was equally attentive to his habiliments, and&#xD;
so indeed were all the gentlemen of Miss Tankerville's family,&#xD;
except perhaps Mr. Seymour.&#xD;
The matin meal was not so lively as the dinner, but except&#xD;
in the absence of Count Wissen, who took coffee in his room&#xD;
and breakfasted a la fourchette in New York at midday,&#xD;
Rosemary found it more agreeable. It was quiet, unceremon-&#xD;
ious and friendly, all which she liked. There was nothing like&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6853-00000191"/>&#xD;
878               ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
flirtation going on, even between parties who seemed in a&#xD;
desperate way the evening previous. The O'Morras were&#xD;
rather silent ; Mr. Seymour bolted his rolls and steak and two&#xD;
cups of coffee, and digested the herald, all in fifteen minutes,&#xD;
and was off; the countess made her boldest essays in English,&#xD;
which were quite charming. The only person who seemed to&#xD;
have enough nervous energy and animal spirits in reserve for&#xD;
the labors of the day to spend any in what looked like gallantry,&#xD;
was Mr. Rory O'Morra after all. Mr. Rory, who did not flirt at&#xD;
all at dinner or in the evening, certainly devoted himself at&#xD;
breakfast to that shy and plain Miss Graves, the music teacher.&#xD;
What could be the attraction ? She was four or five years his&#xD;
senior, her dark eyes were her only good feature, but she had&#xD;
a great deal of musical culture, It appeared also that Mr.&#xD;
Rory and Miss Graves had adjacent rooms (the only ones&#xD;
occupied by boarders) in the attic ; and it seemed that scrupu-&#xD;
lously quiet as the young gentleman was in rising at half-past&#xD;
four, he always had the misfortune to awaken Miss Graves, who&#xD;
affected to complain, but Rosemary thought took pleasure in&#xD;
being so disturbed. Miss Mari considered that Miss Graves&#xD;
would have done better to say nothing about it. In fact, was&#xD;
it not a certain cautious, yet indubitably masculine step on the&#xD;
stairs at a little before five every morning, which broke Miss&#xD;
Mari6's slumbers ? Yet that young lady never breathed the&#xD;
slightest intimation of the fact, nor mentioned that she some-&#xD;
times saw Mr. Rory O'Morra returning home from the gymna-&#xD;
sium in his seven-league boots. And whether young Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra was aware of her own matutinal habits, she did not&#xD;
know, and of course she did not care.&#xD;
We slightly anticipate, for greater convenience. Miss Marie&#xD;
could not complain that the O'Morras neglected her. On the&#xD;
contrary, it was quietly assumed that she was their guest.&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra senior paid her board; that is, he paid the same&#xD;
as before she came, although Miss Mari occupied one of&#xD;
his apartments, and the permanent visitor for whom he had&#xD;
contracted with Miss Tankerville, to cover all his son's fre-&#xD;
quent- guests, as well as his own, was necessarily excluded.&#xD;
Miss Marid- had a conversation with Mr. O'Morra on the sub-&#xD;
&#xD;
A DRIVE TO GREENWOOD.               379&#xD;
ject, and it seemed that they came to a satisfactory under-&#xD;
standing. Mr. O'Morra took also a great, almost affectionate&#xD;
interest in her health, and in devising the means of keeping&#xD;
up her spirits.&#xD;
"You ought to take a drive every fine day," said he, "not&#xD;
alone, but with a pleasant party. I am sorry that my business&#xD;
confines me so much that I cannot take you myself."&#xD;
"So am I, sir," said Rosemary, smiling languidly.&#xD;
"But there is Rory," pursued Mr. O'Morra. "He has no-&#xD;
thing else to. do ; he spends half the day on horseback. Why&#xD;
don't you take out Miss Mari6 in my dog-cart, Rory ?"&#xD;
"I was just wishing to propose it," said Mr. Rory.&#xD;
"It is'the first time I ever knew you lack nerve to propose&#xD;
anything that you wished, sir," said his father.&#xD;
Miss Marie blushed; it was not according to the creed of&#xD;
French demoiselle-hood to take a tete-A-tete drive with a&#xD;
young man; but then she was the guest of the O'Morras. It&#xD;
was the same, mutatis mutandis, as riding out with Roosey, to&#xD;
which she was accustomed.&#xD;
"I am used to riding,' she said, "if Mr. Rory prefers the&#xD;
saddle."&#xD;
"By and by that will do," said Mr. O'Morra. "Your first&#xD;
excursion must not be on horseback. Besides, I want you to&#xD;
try my dog-cart, Miss Rose."&#xD;
So the dog-cart was at the door at three in the afternoon.&#xD;
Miss Marie was charmed with the vehicle; it was so pretty, so&#xD;
convenient and so nicely balanced. But when Mr. Rory had&#xD;
handed her in, she felt somewhat alarmed at finding herself so&#xD;
completely exposed to observation.&#xD;
"Not more so than in riding," said Rory.&#xD;
"That is true," said Rosemary, gathering her skirts about&#xD;
her feet, and pulling down a thick green vei. "I hope you&#xD;
will not be ashamed, Mr. Rory, of driving a lady who wears a&#xD;
green veil," said shego laughing.&#xD;
"It is'an impenetrable disguise," he replied. "I am going&#xD;
to take you to Greenwood, Miss Mari6, where I have a plan to&#xD;
submit to you."&#xD;
&#xD;

A DRIVE TO GREENWOOD.         881&#xD;
&#xD;
"This is the pleasantest kind of carriage I ever was in,&#xD;
said Rosemary, "but why is it called a dog-cart 2"&#xD;
"The box was originally designed to carry a sportsman's&#xD;
dogs. The governor had it built in England ; it is a very&#xD;
handy concern for him, as he visits very often a villa we own&#xD;
a few miles out, and he can bring home lots of fruit and vege-&#xD;
tables in the box, you see. It is a capital contrive."&#xD;
O'Morra explained very learnedly all the advantages of the&#xD;
vehicle.&#xD;
"It does remarkably well for the governor," he observed, in&#xD;
reply to her expressions of admiration, "but is rather an old-&#xD;
fogyish concern for me. When I do drive, as my mare is very&#xD;
fast, I like a lighter drag."&#xD;
"Do you drive one of those slender skeleton affairs, with&#xD;
wheels like spider webs and no body at allt?" asked Rosemary,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
" Sorella makes 2:40 easily in a drag like that," replied the&#xD;
young man, "and I own I am proud of her performance."&#xD;
" She is a beautiful creature," said Rosemary. "And equally&#xD;
kind, you say, under the saddle and in harness."&#xD;
" Don't let my friend Forrester hear you call a horse a crea-&#xD;
ture," said Rory, laughing, "or you will never hear the last&#xD;
of it."&#xD;
O'Morra was very frank and off-hand ; more brother-like a&#xD;
great deal, Rosemary thought, than either Roosevelt or any of&#xD;
her Varick cousins had ever been. Nevertheless it was a novel&#xD;
sensation for the beautiful heiress-this drive with a young&#xD;
man, of a beauty equal to her own, though so different; Rose-&#xD;
mary had never experienced anything quite like it ; and as&#xD;
they glided along swiftly and noiselessly over the track of the&#xD;
city railroad, her heart fluttered a good deal, while her com-&#xD;
panion was as calm as if he had been a brother indeed. Rory&#xD;
proposed to go to Greenwood at once, by the straight road, and&#xD;
after finishing what they had there to do,to take a longer and&#xD;
more picturesque way home.&#xD;
Rosemary had never been at Greenwood but once in her&#xD;
life, and as she wasthen not in a favorable situation to see or&#xD;
admire its beauties, they burst upon her now with all the charm&#xD;
&#xD;
of novelty. Rory loitered along the lovely avenues, and pointed&#xD;
out to his delighted companion the rich combinations of foliage,&#xD;
the graceful diversity of surface, the brilliant flowers (the roses&#xD;
were just beginning to bloom), and here and there the tasteful&#xD;
monuments which adorn this abode of death. Here were deep&#xD;
glens ; there miniature lakes embosomed in trees and with&#xD;
fountains ever dripping ; here were green and silent glades.&#xD;
There was a great deal to awaken sentiment, yet O'Morra&#xD;
never uttered any. Never once did he let his voice sink to a&#xD;
sympathetic whisper ; he quietly checked his beautiful mare,&#xD;
criticized a little the monuments on general :principles, and&#xD;
assented to Rosemary's rather ingenuous observations: she was&#xD;
quite deeply affected and very much charmed.&#xD;
" The remains of so many who are dear to me will repose&#xD;
here at last, I suppose, though mine will not," she said.&#xD;
"Perhaps they will," said O'Morra, bluntly. "You had a&#xD;
narrow escape once."&#xD;
As he said this, they stopped, Rosemary knew not why,&#xD;
before a gray vault, grim and stern, of the plainest architecture,&#xD;
with a door of iron, massive, riveted, and impenetrable.&#xD;
Rosemary regarded it for a moment curiously, for her com-&#xD;
panion said nothing to explain why they stopped; and then,&#xD;
carved in the granite, in square stone letters above the iron&#xD;
door, she read the name-&#xD;
" DASHON."&#xD;
Young O'Morra's voice -did sink at last into the deepest of&#xD;
manly tones.&#xD;
"That door has a bank-safe lock, the key of which your&#xD;
grandmother keeps in her own custody, she tells me. Every&#xD;
afternoon.-rain or shine-they come hither ; Mr. Johnson&#xD;
unlocks the vault, your grandfather is helped out of the car-&#xD;
riage and enters, and a fresh wreath of flowers is hung - on&#xD;
--- your coffin, Rosemary!"&#xD;
The girl looked at him, then at the grim vault; her features&#xD;
worked a minute convulsively ; suddenly she averted her face ;&#xD;
the next instant she burst into a passion of loud weeping and&#xD;
&#xD;

A DRIVE TO GREENWOOD.&#xD;
&#xD;
violent sobs, O'Morra regarding her in pitying silence. As&#xD;
soon as the first paroxysm had-spent itself and was ending in&#xD;
convulsive sighs and efforts to catch her breath, he touched the&#xD;
reins and drove on rapidly toward the most retired part of the&#xD;
cemetery. By degrees her passion subsided and she attempted&#xD;
to speak, but the first effort at articulation brought on another&#xD;
storm of tears, cries and sobs, beyond control.&#xD;
"Don't try to talk, and don't try to resist your feelings, my&#xD;
dear Miss Dashon," said Rory. "That only makes it worse."&#xD;
Rosemary had the sense to take this advice, and she soon&#xD;
began to weep quietly like a woman. After they had driven&#xD;
on awhile, and looked at the ocean view, drinking in the salt&#xD;
breeze, her tranquillity returned.&#xD;
"It is no disgrace to a woman to cry, but I am ashamed to&#xD;
cry in such a very disagreeable and ungraceful manner, Mr.&#xD;
Rory," said she, with a smile-very difficult to withstand.&#xD;
"Nothing you do can ever be ungraceful or disagreeable, I&#xD;
think :-oh! no more tears, my dear Miss Marie ! Remember&#xD;
that we are liable to meet people any minute ; we are very&#xD;
lucky to have escaped so long."&#xD;
"I shall not be overcome again, Mr. Rory," answered Rose-&#xD;
mary, drawing down her veil, which in the cemetery she had&#xD;
thrown back. "But in truth you must understand that my&#xD;
feelings in regard to my grandparents are somewhat tender"-&#xD;
a little sob under the veil-" and-that they have long been sup-&#xD;
pressed."-A deep sigh.&#xD;
"Your self-control," observed the young man, whose voice&#xD;
unawares had lost its fine clear resonance, "has often sur-&#xD;
prised me."&#xD;
"I pay for it in secret by many a bitter tear. Let me talk&#xD;
now, Mr. Rory-I can do it without losing the command of&#xD;
myself. Confess that my situation is without a parallel. I&#xD;
love my grandpapa and grandmamma Dashon more than I can&#xD;
express: but what can I do ' It is clear that my life has been&#xD;
attempted by my own relatives, aided by. the sagacity of a&#xD;
demon in human shape. Shall I wait till grandpapa and grand-&#xD;
mamma arrive this afternoon, and throw myself in their arms '&#xD;
Gracious Heaven, Mr. Rory ! what a thunder-stroke to them&#xD;

break it with all the delicacy possible-I have imagined a&#xD;

"They must be brought to justice."&#xD;
"That is easy to say, but they are myblood&#xD;
grace is my own. The chief criminal is a Dashon by birth,&#xD;
like myself; a woman like myself; there       b li&#xD;

~ in  hame  NoMr. Rory, I would grant her a free&#xD;
pardon. I would rather share -my fortune with her unhappy&#xD;

"That is magnanimous, Rosemary, but not just," said th&#xD;
young sculptor, warmly. "If they suffer in conse&#xD;

&#xD;
such a step at present, for although he has been on the trace&#xD;
of this affair for a month, and knows more than you or I, there&#xD;
is a link in the evidence which is wanting."&#xD;
"You cannot be in better hands than my father's, to advise&#xD;
on such a point," said Mr. Rory.&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Rory, I am distrustful of myself. Time has been&#xD;
when I hated the Varicks vindictively ; and if I pity and&#xD;
spare them now--"&#xD;
Her voice trembled-&#xD;
"It is because you have learned to subdue your passions,"&#xD;
said O'Morra, with a smile.&#xD;
"It has been the battle of my girlhood to conquer those evil&#xD;
and wicked feelings-and even now-sometimes-I long to&#xD;
spring among them with vengeance (which'I then call justice)&#xD;
in both hands-calm as death, and as pitiless ! Ah, now you&#xD;
know me too well, Mr. Rory !"&#xD;
"You would be more than human not to feel so sometimes."&#xD;
" Why their cruelty was infamous ! Had it been I only&#xD;
whom they struck ! and yet I had never harmed them. But it&#xD;
was the heart of their benefactor that they ruthlessly pierced.&#xD;
They deprived doting parents of an only child, a bridegroom&#xD;
of his bride, an innocent girl of her life (as they thought), in&#xD;
one moment."&#xD;
Rosemary was excited and spoke with unusual freedom and&#xD;
energy. She had thrown back her veil again. At a short&#xD;
turning a carriage came in sight, passing them swiftly ; as it&#xD;
went by, a lady looking from the window, shrieked and fell&#xD;
back.&#xD;
With an alert and graceful movement Rosemary half turned,&#xD;
half rose, and gazed after the retiring carriage with such a&#xD;
momentary expression of energetic disdain on her remarkable&#xD;
profile, as if she had said-" There sped an arrow winged with&#xD;
terror and remorse !"-It was a lightning flash, and the next&#xD;
moment she had resumed her seat and drew down her veil:-&#xD;
"Let us attend to our business here, Mr. Rory, and go."&#xD;
O'Morra was thinking of the same thing. An expression let&#xD;
fallfby his companion had struck him painfully, checking the&#xD;
sympathy that was beginning to flow in a very unguarded way.&#xD;
&#xD;
"A bridegroom from his bride," she had said. des, no doubt&#xD;
she had wished to remind him, in case he were founding some&#xD;
presumptuous expectation on their unusual intimacy, that she&#xD;
was the same as a married woman after all. And he had been&#xD;
calling her "Rosemary." It was from the cautious Wissen that&#xD;
he had learned this pet name of the beautiful stranger. With&#xD;
these reflections the young man drove on a little way in silence,&#xD;
and when he again addressed his companion, it was in the calm&#xD;
tone which he flattered himself he had so successfully adopted at&#xD;
the beginning of their drive. Her emotion and impassioned&#xD;
language and almost tender confidence had betrayed him into&#xD;
forgetting it. In future he would be more on his guard. In&#xD;
fact, was not Miss Dashon's slight departure from reserve in&#xD;
his favor a proof that unconsciously she regarded herself as&#xD;
wedded? Rory was used to be petted and flattered and&#xD;
spoken'to very confidentially by married ladies : but what an&#xD;
impertinence in that case to call her "Rosemary !"  He quite&#xD;
blushed at his mistake. Yet how avoid it with that exquisite&#xD;
maidenly shyness and self-government in movement and&#xD;
posture seated beside him ? Mr. Rory was puzzled ; not more&#xD;
so than his companion by the sudden change of. his manner-&#xD;
and thinking over its possible reasons, she laid the blame on&#xD;
herself, and blushed as vividly as he did.&#xD;
They reached the Dashon vault again. O'Morra leaped from&#xD;
the vehicle and-handed Rosemary out. He then described to&#xD;
her his plan. Instead of a showy monument, a mere monument&#xD;
dedicated to family vanity and selfish grief, such as had been&#xD;
proposed ;-an open structure it was to have been, all niches and&#xD;
crocketting and finials, and statuary;-instead of this, he pro.-&#xD;
posed to build a new vault, in the form of a chapel, on the&#xD;
summit.of the knoll---.&#xD;
" A mortuary chapel, with a bell, and a simple altar, where&#xD;
sacred rites may be performed and prayers offered"-with a&#xD;
calm smile, to Rosemary quite inscrutable--" for your repose,&#xD;
and that of your catholic descendants to the remotest genera..&#xD;
tion: for apart from that destiny the consecration which the&#xD;
spot has received becomes unmeaning The remains of your&#xD;
father, Miss Dashon, are to be removed from the lower vault,&#xD;

which, it seems, has been purposely excluded from the bene-&#xD;
diction, and will be placed in a lateral tomb; those of your&#xD;
mother will be laid by his side-"&#xD;
"Kind, kind grandmamma !" exclaimed Rosemary, in a&#xD;
faltering tone.&#xD;
"In an arch which I destine for you," added the young&#xD;
sculptor, very seriously, "there will be the sarcophagus and&#xD;
figure which I have already described to you. May it be long&#xD;
before that design, executed while you are in life (thank God!)&#xD;
and in the flower of your beauty and your youth, shall acquire&#xD;
its full significance."&#xD;
"You were right, Mr. Rory, to say a little while ago that I&#xD;
shall probably be buried here," said Rosemary, with cheerful-&#xD;
ness. "Really, there is something extremely fascinating to&#xD;
me thus to plan the spot where one's mortal part will await the&#xD;
joyful moment--"&#xD;
"When sea and land shall give up their dead," said the&#xD;
young man.&#xD;
"You are very unlike any artists whom I have ever known&#xD;
before, Mr. Rory, in having so clear a vision of the unseen&#xD;
realities," said Rosemary. "I think it must be the secret of&#xD;
your power."&#xD;
They then made the ascent of the hill on foot, by a steep&#xD;
winding road, the mare following her master's voice, and trying&#xD;
to catch a nibble of the grassy border. Arrived at the sum-&#xD;
mit, he left her in the road, still and obedient, while he conducted&#xD;
Rosemary over the. grass to the very spot which he proposed&#xD;
for the chapel. It was directly over the vault below. There&#xD;
was even an opening-a stone tube, trumpet-shaped-which&#xD;
pierced down to the vault, and suffered its moisture (if any) to&#xD;
escape.-" The floor," said O'Morra, "is a peculiar white&#xD;
lime-stone, which has the most extraordinary disinfecting&#xD;
property."-&#xD;
While they conversed, Rory glanced at his watch and then&#xD;
down the tour.&#xD;
'   "You see something, Mr. O'Morra-ah ! grandmamma's&#xD;
carriage ! Let us go! No, no! cannot I hide where I can at&#xD;

&#xD;
"If you can command yourself you c&#xD;

Then the carriage drove up. John, the footman, aided by&#xD;

tree. "She has the grace- to keep down her;veil at least.&#xD;
Have the goodness, Mr. O'Morra, when you next give us&#xD;
rendezvous here, do you understand ? to come alone-that's&#xD;
all."-&#xD;
Rory, who understood nothing of it, was thunderstruck. In&#xD;
an ordinary case . he would have known how to reply and to&#xD;
resent with warmth the imputation upon a lady under his&#xD;
protection, but in the first place he did not know what dis-&#xD;
pleased madam, and in the next, the fact that it was her own&#xD;
grandchild of whom she thus spoke, rendered im speechless.&#xD;
"Oh, aunty !" said Augusta, " I don't think it was the young&#xD;
lady with Mr. O'Morra at all :-it was cousin Rosemary's own&#xD;
voice, as plain as I ever heard it in my life."&#xD;
"What nonsense !" cried grandmamma angrily. "You are&#xD;
as bad as your uncle or that fool Johnson, who stands trem-&#xD;
bling there like an aspen, instead of getting on his box. What&#xD;
are you waiting for, sir ?"-very sharply.&#xD;
The sharp reproofs of old Mrs. Dashon got the terrified ser-&#xD;
vants into their places without delay. O'Morra now nndei-&#xD;
standing the case, thought it necessary to his dignity to make&#xD;
- an observation,&#xD;
"Permit me to say, madam," said he, rather gravely, "that I&#xD;
am not accustomed to drive out with young ladies capable of&#xD;
the slightest breach of propriety, still more of such a gross. one&#xD;
as you suppose. As for my present companion, who I repeat,&#xD;
is our guest, I will venture to assert that there is not nor ever&#xD;
was a female member of your own family, living or dead, with&#xD;
a nicer sense of what is due to herself and others, or more scru-,&#xD;
pulous in observing it."&#xD;
"Very bold, very bold !" said grandmamma, while poor Mr.&#xD;
Dashon stretched out his tremulous hand to the young man in&#xD;
a suppliant manner. "To compare your lady yonder with my&#xD;
peerless Rose !".&#xD;
"I adhere to it, madam," says Mr. Rory.&#xD;
Augusta glanced up at the figure ; noted the thick green&#xD;
veil; the gray dress trimmed with green; and saw nothing&#xD;
else remarkable except one foot, perfectly chaussa and very&#xD;
symmetrical, that hung just clear of the grass in the shadow&#xD;
&#xD;
of the ample skirts. 'A recollection of some sort affected&#xD;
-she started as if she had   cino    oesr     etd her ;&#xD;
she tared  s ifshehadseen a ghost, as well as heard the&#xD;
voice of one. Grandmamma's quick eye followed the   th&#xD;
lady's movement, and she -tootechoud&#xD;
as c    mnt and etoo changed color, as she glanced at&#xD;
that charming foot and gracious posture, though the vele&#xD;
face was now laid close to therveiled&#xD;
"I believe I shall get superstitious too, if I stay here much&#xD;
longer," said grandmamma  "Your young friend-I see she&#xD;
is young--may not have known what she was doing-it is a&#xD;
sort of ear-trumpet, do you understand? No doubt it affects&#xD;
the nervous system to hear anything of that kind  ie you&#xD;

And so the stately equipage, with its black hamnercloth and&#xD;
tall footman, flashed away along the green avenues of the&#xD;
cemetery.&#xD;
O'Morra and Rosemary returned home by a beautiful drive,&#xD;
among lanes and back-roads, by sumptuous villas; the young&#xD;

&#xD;
and Rosemary? Yet we see that a good deal of sentiment has&#xD;
been exchanged between them, to say nothing of electric com..&#xD;
munications which our recording instrument is not delicate&#xD;
enough to jot down. One thing is certain: it was a long time&#xD;
before Rose Marie Dashon took another tote-a-tote drive with&#xD;
Mr. Rory O'Morra. Perhaps she felt that it was too agreeable&#xD;
to be safe; perhaps that the footing on which they stood was&#xD;
too uncertain to render it quite agreeable ito either ; perhaps&#xD;
she merely feared it would compromise her in the eyes of the&#xD;
world, and cause reports to fly about, in which of course there&#xD;
would not be a word of truth, but not the less unpleasant&#xD;
.that account. To avoid all appearance of particular inti acy&#xD;
with any young gentleman was one of her earlie  nd best--&#xD;
conned lessons. Rosemary never flirted, in spi of the general&#xD;
example. In fact she soon passed in the hou e for an indiffer-&#xD;
ent. She passed her evenings in great par with the family,&#xD;
but she never would talk for more than a few minutes together&#xD;
with any of the young, i. e., unmarried gentlemen. Count&#xD;
Wissen was the sole exception, an exception on which he was&#xD;
rallied, but of which he fully appreciated the significance.&#xD;
Yet Mr. Rory O'Morra had not much reason to complain&#xD;
either. Miss Maris was sitting to him for a statue of herself.&#xD;
It was a profound secret, like so many other facts about her,&#xD;
known to several persons. Madame dEhrenstein accompanied&#xD;
Mifs Marie to Mr. O'Morra's studio. I doubt whether these&#xD;
opportunities were not equal to a buggy drive ; indeed to a&#xD;
good many of them. Miss Marie was certainly much more off&#xD;
her guard. She became more intimately acquainted with the&#xD;
character, and could study the genius of Mr. Rory O'Morra.&#xD;
Moreover a sculptor's studio was a novel scene for her, and not&#xD;
without a romantic interest. The circumstances were romantic&#xD;
altogether, and if our heroine withstands their influence she&#xD;
must be more or less than woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
ARAB.&#xD;
I' was the count who arranged this matter with Madame&#xD;
d'Ehrenstein, and perhaps had he never occasion for a finer&#xD;
diplomatic skill. Mr. Rory's extreme innocence may be infer-&#xD;
red from the fact that he did not at first see the absolute&#xD;
necessity of a chaperon for Miss Marie, in the case of her&#xD;
sitting to him. He mentioned a lady whose bust he had&#xD;
executed, and who always came alone.&#xD;
" She was married, of course," said Miss Marie.&#xD;
"Oh, certainly-her husband gave me the commission."&#xD;
" Oh !" said Rosemary, laughing, "that explains it. Madame&#xD;
and mademoiselle !-they are beings of an entirely different&#xD;
species, you understand ?" She looked like'her grandmother&#xD;
in saying it, and even her laugh, sweet and musical, had some-&#xD;
thing of Mrs. Dashon's short, satirical emphasis. She was&#xD;
amused at Mr. Rory's simplicity in supposing that she-demoi--&#xD;
selle-she-Rose Marie Dashon !-would visit a young man's&#xD;
studio without a matron ! Above all, clandestinely ! for the&#xD;
matter was to be a profound secret.&#xD;
Not only so. The person by whom she was to be matronized&#xD;
was not to the young lady an indifferent question. Miss Tan-&#xD;
kerville was only demoiselle, after all, and was too busy; Mrs.&#xD;
Varick was not to be -trusted; no other lady but Madame&#xD;
d'Ehrenstein, in short, would quite answer: but who would ask&#xD;
Madame d'Ehrenstein ?-" Not I, certainly," said Mademoiselle&#xD;
Rose Marie ; "nor you, Mr. Rory."&#xD;
"The person to do it," said ; Mr. Rory, who began dimly to&#xD;
see the difficulty, "is Count Wissen."&#xD;
" And who shall ask M. de Wissen ?'' demanded Rosemary.&#xD;
"Encore unefois, not I, monsieur I"&#xD;

"'I will ask him myself."&#xD;
Mr. Rory asked the count to ask Madame d'Ehrenstein.&#xD;
The count first carefully ascertained from Mademoiselle Rose&#xD;
that such was her desire ; then he proposed it to madame.&#xD;
Madame liked Mademoiselle Marie exceedingly, but she was&#xD;
averse to meddling in any affairs of other people where secrecy&#xD;
was to be observed, particularly if a very accomplished young&#xD;
man and a very beautiful young lady were the parties. All&#xD;
the objections which the tact of Rosemary foresaw, came up.&#xD;
Why should it be made a secret? It was to be a draped&#xD;
figure, she inferred, of course?.&#xD;
" Fie, madame la comtesse !" said M. de Wissen.&#xD;
"Then why the secret ? And why shall not any other mar-&#xD;
ried lady in the family answer as well as I ."&#xD;
"If you accept the office, madame, the most complete con-&#xD;
fidence shall be placed in your discretion. The reasons shall&#xD;
be told you."&#xD;
Madame wished the revelation antecedent to the promise.&#xD;
The Minister pointed out that this could not be expected.&#xD;
Piqued by curiosity and willing, after all, to oblige all the&#xD;
parties, madame consented on condition that the secret when&#xD;
revealed did not violate her sense of the proprieties.&#xD;
"The secret is, madam," said the count, "that Miss Marie&#xD;
is supposed by her family to be dead, and the statue for&#xD;
which she is to sit has been ordered by them for her tomb."&#xD;
"That is frightful !" said the countess.&#xD;
"It is one of those crimes," said the Minister, "which every&#xD;
day approximate the model republic more and more to the&#xD;
most corrupt of the old European societies."&#xD;
4' A crime," said the countess, "of which Mademoiselle&#xD;
Marie has barely escaped being the victim ?"&#xD;
"You divine it."&#xD;
" She is, then, aP I had conjectured, a great heiress ? Per-&#xD;
haps also has she still reason to fear."&#xD;
"She has motives of her own, and very amiable ones, for&#xD;
secrecy ; but for my part.I frankly avow to you that I do not&#xD;
consider her life safe, if her enemies discover that she has&#xD;
escaped the fate they destined for her. The crime cannot (in&#xD;

my opinion) be traced to them, nbr is there anything that can&#xD;
hinder its repetition."&#xD;
"You overwhelm me," said Madame d'Ehrenstein. "If I&#xD;
can serve mademoiselle, she may command me."&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon, who had no idea of the amount of labor&#xD;
involved, wished the chapel to be finished by early autumn.&#xD;
Mr. Rory informed her that it was rigorously possible, but&#xD;
would greatly increase the expense.--" That is of no con-&#xD;
sequence, do you understand ?"-" Then we shall double&#xD;
the estimate," said Mr. Rory.-Thus the affair went forward&#xD;
regardless of cost. In some points the desired rapidity of exe-&#xD;
cution-was quite easy. The plan of the chapel was already in&#xD;
O'Morra's portfolio, for it was an idea on which he had long&#xD;
meditated; he placed it immediately in the hands of an archi-.&#xD;
tect who engaged to produce without delay the working draw-&#xD;
ings. The instant these were finished, they were committed to&#xD;
the best workmen, and the liberality of the terms secured&#xD;
utmost promptitude. The foundation was commenced at o e.&#xD;
The second day after Rosemary's visit to Greenwood, destroyed&#xD;
for a time the beauty of the knoll. Grandmamma having&#xD;
her husband's power of attorney, opened a credit for Mr. Rory&#xD;
O'Morra at her bank, for the full amount of his estimate, assur-&#xD;
ing him that more should be forthcoming, if desid.&#xD;
Every evening Mr. Rory had something to communicate to&#xD;
Miss Marid. When he informed her of her grandmother's&#xD;
great business liberality, he added:-" I can now lend you any&#xD;
amount you may require."&#xD;
"That is good news," said Rosemary, "for I have only a few&#xD;
shillings left, since paying Dr. Galenson ; and I wish to send a&#xD;
handsome consultation-fee to Dr Mannikin."&#xD;
O'Morra smiled; not grimly, like his father; yet there was&#xD;
a trick of his father in it.&#xD;
"My father will lend you as much as you want, but I&#xD;
thought it would be more agreeable to you to use what is&#xD;
reallyyour own, like your grandmother's deposit to my&#xD;
credit."&#xD;
"Don't give yourself the trouble to explain the propriety of&#xD;
it," said Rosemary, laughing. "I shall draw on you without&#xD;

the slightest scruple. When you present the item in your&#xD;
account-' Furnished Miss Dashon for pocket-money'-you&#xD;
need not fear it will be disputed. But as something may&#xD;
happen to me, I will always give you a receipt."&#xD;
This was, indeed, a great relief to our heroine, to whom the.&#xD;
novel pressure of pecuniary difficulty was very irksome. With&#xD;
the generous feeling of an heiress whose life had been saved,&#xD;
by consummate skill and unbounded assiduity, she had in-&#xD;
sisted on paying Dr. Galenson a fee which the most eminent&#xD;
physician in New York would have considered liberal for at-&#xD;
tending a difficult case in Brooklyn, besides forcing on his&#xD;
acceptance a ring of great value, in token of her esteem. Of&#xD;
course she had been obliged to have recourse to Mr. Cahal&#xD;
O'Morra, who gage her the money and chid her extravagance.&#xD;
"Which is quite absurd, you know, Mr. Rory, when you&#xD;
i ecollect that every flounce on my wedding-dress costias much&#xD;
as the sum I offered Dr. Galen on for saving my life."&#xD;
"My father feels that he is your trustee-in loco parenhis,--.&#xD;
and he regards your interest."&#xD;
"II comprehend it," said Rosemary, "and feel very disagree-&#xD;
ably checked all the same."    .&#xD;
"I see," said Rory, smiling, "that a young woman of fortune&#xD;
is precisely like a young man in the article of expenditure."&#xD;
"Nay," said Rosemary, "all my expenditure is strictly ne-&#xD;
cessary ; and I assure you I am charmed to have a large bank&#xD;
account to fall back upon. I shall ask you for money, sir, and&#xD;
never tell you what I want to do with it."&#xD;
Miss Maria (who never flirted) had. often a very saucy.&#xD;
way of talking to Mr. Rory O'Morra. Their conversations&#xD;
were almost all confidential; they snatched their opportuni-&#xD;
ties ; or rather, to be quite accurate, Miss Marie (uncon-&#xD;
sciously lingering on the stairs, or walking by herself on the&#xD;
terrace to cull a nosegay for her hair or bosom) afforded such&#xD;
opportunities, which Mr. Rory snatched. Then, as we said,&#xD;
Miss Marie's manner was a little vivacious-not pert (Heaven&#xD;
forbid !)-but just tinctured with that sparkling sub-acid qua-&#xD;
lity which sisters sometimes manifest with brothers whom they&#xD;
love, There was certainly no sentiment in it, Mr. Rory al-&#xD;
&#xD;
lowed; and every now and then, quite carelessly, was dropped&#xD;
an allusion to the wedding-dress or the pearl-parure, or some&#xD;
thing to recall that the young lady had been an expectant&#xD;
bride. Mr. Rory never prolonged the colloquy beyond neces-&#xD;
sity:  for Miss Marie, with all that sweet acerbity, seldom&#xD;
used a young lady's privilege of terminating their interviews&#xD;
herself,&#xD;
The news or the deposit, and the consent of Madame d'Ehren-&#xD;
stein were imparted the same evening. Some days, however,&#xD;
would necessarily elapse, before O'Morra could so far complete&#xD;
the other preliminaries as to devote himself to the statue, on&#xD;
which he wished to concentrate his undivided powers. In the&#xD;
meantime an unexpected and even singular movement of&#xD;
grandmamma Dashon occurred, which, like her liberal credit&#xD;
to the young sculptor, gave a livelier pleasure to Miss Mari6&#xD;
than to him. It would seem that Mrs. Dashon felt that she had&#xD;
been uncivil to O'Morra in the scene at the vault. At all&#xD;
events, on the day after the estimate was agreed upon, she&#xD;
sent him a note to the following effect:&#xD;
"Mrs. Dashon presents her compliments to Mr. Roderick&#xD;
O'Morra, and begs him, as he is fond of riding, to accept a&#xD;
horse which belonged to Miss Dashon, and which is suffering&#xD;
from want of exercise, no one else being permitted to mount&#xD;
him. He is a perfect lady's horse, though a little wild just&#xD;
now; and after a few days' riding would suit very well Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra's fair friend and guest, whose relations to Mr. R. O'M.&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon can scarcely mistake.&#xD;
"No. --       Avi uj, May, 1855."&#xD;
On the terrace after dinner, the sin just setting behind the&#xD;
Jersey hills, Mr. Rory quietly put this note into the hands of&#xD;
Miss MariC, who blushed to the roots of her black tresses, as&#xD;
she read it.&#xD;
"Grandmamma is a lady to her finger-tips !" said she. "And&#xD;
Arab 2"&#xD;
"Is in the stable at the studio."&#xD;
"I will ride him to-morrow."&#xD;

note says he is wild, which must be so, if he has not been&#xD;
properly exercised."&#xD;
"Do you think," said Rosemary, with a deep feminine in-&#xD;
spiration, "that I am afraid to tame down Arab ?"&#xD;
"It is clear that this present is designed for your benefit,"&#xD;
said O'Morra, "for there is a side-saddle with the horse, and a&#xD;
parcel, which, not conceiving at all what it was, I opened.'&#xD;
"What was it ?" demanded Rosemary, with another vivid&#xD;
suffusion.&#xD;
"A riding-habit, with hat, gloves, whip, boots--"&#xD;
"Oh, grandmamma !"-She conned the note again.-" She&#xD;
nas no idea of the truth, I am certain!-I understand it.&#xD;
Nothing that is mine must ever be owned or worn by the Var-&#xD;
icks, or by Augusta ! Stern, sage grandmamma !"&#xD;
"She has fallen into a very natural mistake on one point,"&#xD;
observed O'Morra.&#xD;
The young lady stooped to pluck a flower.&#xD;
"It will be time to correct it (if that is what you mean) when&#xD;
all her mistakes are rectified."&#xD;
"In thanking her, then, I shall not allude to it?"&#xD;
"Consult your own wishes in that respect, Mr. O'Morra,"&#xD;
said the young lady, with infinite composure. "To me it is a&#xD;
matter of-perfect indifference."-Pulling to pieces one of the&#xD;
finest roses that ever grew.&#xD;
"Then I shall thank her in my own name, and in that of my&#xD;
lovely friend and guest,'' said O'Morra, with more than usual&#xD;
spirit and emphasis, "and pass over the rest in silence."&#xD;
"But remember, Mr. Rory, that the horse is mine-as much&#xD;
as the habit, which certainly appertains in no wise to you"-&#xD;
laughing gaily and satirically. " Grahdmamma has no right to&#xD;
give away my property."&#xD;
Other boarders drew near,- hearing the twilight laughter,&#xD;
among them Count Wissen, and O'Morra disappeared.&#xD;
The horse was brought to the door the next afternoon, led&#xD;
by a mounted groom: Mr. Rory accompanying on Sorella.&#xD;
Arab was excited, plunged, reared, and could scarcely be held&#xD;
by the united exertions of Mr. Rory and the groom. The&#xD;
ladies gathered in the porch to see the beautiful horse; which&#xD;
&#xD;
had the effect to frighten him more, so that he seemed quite&#xD;
unmanageable, and the ladies declared that it would be the&#xD;
most foolhardy thing for Miss Marie to ride him. Why did not&#xD;
Mr. Rory, who was a perfect horseman, exchange with her ?&#xD;
Then appeared on the steps Rosemary Dashon, quite superb&#xD;
in beauty, in dark-green riding-habit--an open jacket richly&#xD;
embroidered and white marseilles waistcoat buttoned  to&#xD;
her throat. She was booted for the ride, but one rose-white&#xD;
hand was bare. Arab started so suddenly and violently that&#xD;
he got away from the groom. He dashed to the gate of the&#xD;
court-yard, but O'Morra had just taken the precaution to close&#xD;
it. The horse recoiled upon his haunches, then plunged&#xD;
furiously.towards the garden, leaped over the box-borders, and&#xD;
drew back suddenly on the edge of the terrace, which went off&#xD;
sheer fifteen feet.&#xD;
"Don't go near him !" cried Rosemary. "All keep away !&#xD;
Let me manage him. Mr. O'Morra, I entreat !"&#xD;
The girl advanced down the gravelled walk slowly, holding&#xD;
her skirt, and calling: "Arab! Arab !'' in a sweet low voice.&#xD;
The horse pricked up his ears. Starting again with a wild&#xD;
movement he threw his head in the air, and pranced round the&#xD;
garden, trampling the flower-beds.&#xD;
"Arab! good fellow ! Arab !"-In a soothing tone.&#xD;
He approached her extended hand. She stood still, dropped&#xD;
her train, and with the other hand now liberated forbade any&#xD;
one to interfere.&#xD;
" Arab ! good boy--Arab !".-The veiled caressing tone vi-&#xD;
brated on every ear.&#xD;
The horse trembled all over. The girl quietly gathered up&#xD;
her skirt again, moved one foot cautiously forward; she threw&#xD;
her arm over his neck; he neighed piteously---&#xD;
Down, Arab !"-And Arab knelt on the grass ; Rosemary&#xD;
seated herself in the saddle, and held on to the horn, while he&#xD;
rose. It was the most beautiful sight. The delight of the&#xD;
animal was evident, pawing, curveting, *hirling around with&#xD;
restrained bounds under. his young  mistress.  The girl&#xD;
smiled--all radiant with her triumph.---" Come, Mr. Rory, let&#xD;
us be off!"&#xD;

&#xD;
Arab and Sorella sprang through the open gateway abreast&#xD;
of each other, and the lady and the cavalier galloped up&#xD;
the shady street. Solemn as a post, and stiff as the marble&#xD;
horseman in Don Juan,Mr. O'Morra's groom trotted after them.&#xD;
" Th it's a match !" said Miss Tankerville.&#xD;
"Do you think so ?" cried Mrs. Varick. "Why they hardly&#xD;
speak ; and Miss Marie will talk in French to the count by the&#xD;
hour !"&#xD;
"Miss Marie is not like you, dear, to announce her partiali-&#xD;
ties in large show-bills."&#xD;
"Very fine ! Miss Marie is perfection, of course, in your&#xD;
opinion, Miss Tankerville ! But for all that, I am convinced&#xD;
she has sether heart upon being a countess."&#xD;
"What do you think, Madame d'Ehrenstein ?" asked Miss&#xD;
Tankerville.&#xD;
"M. de Wissen is likely to captivate any young girl, if he&#xD;
seriously undertake it," said the countess, diplomatically.&#xD;
"Monsieur O'Morra is also a young man of singular advantages."&#xD;
"Mr. Rory O'Morra," observed Mrs. Seymour, rather ear-&#xD;
nestly, yet laughing at the same time, " is not more attentive&#xD;
to Miss Marid than he is bound to be to his father's guest. I&#xD;
think he is remarkably distant to her, and that she feels it."&#xD;
"You are as clear-sighted as my sister Laura," said Miss&#xD;
Tankerville.&#xD;
"My theory is," said' Miss Graves, " that Miss Marie is mar-&#xD;
ried already."&#xD;
"Oh !" cried all the ladies, and there was a general laugh at&#xD;
Miss Graves's expense.&#xD;
A curious figure-an old beggar, in an inky slouched hat,&#xD;
neglected tow-like beard and venerable rags-had watched&#xD;
this whole scene from without the courtyard railing. Few&#xD;
else had noticed him, but the quick eye of Rose Dashon, ever&#xD;
on the look out for wayside misery, and accustomed to inter-&#xD;
pret the silence of hundreds of humble petitioners, had per-&#xD;
ceived him in the milst'of her excitement ; and as Rosemary,&#xD;
with the princely spirit that nature and culture had given her,&#xD;
was always prepared for these occasions,~she had tossed the&#xD;
poor wretch a piece of silver as she cantered by.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
ALMOST A PROPOSAL.&#xD;
THE day following was rainy. No ride. The day after was&#xD;
fine. Miss Marie and O'Morra rode out together. It is unde-&#xD;
niable that these rides were very agreeable to Rosemary. Why&#xD;
not ? They were perfectly en regle, in the first place. A young&#xD;
lady necessarily rides; as necessarily she needs a cavalier,&#xD;
With a groom some dozen yards behind (provided the groom's&#xD;
steed can keep so near), mademoiselle is under surveillance.&#xD;
To a right-minded young woman that is an infinite comfort.&#xD;
She has the consciousness of being all right. Yet O'Morra&#xD;
was a somewhat silent and reserved companion. He had not&#xD;
resources always at his command to entertain a young lady for&#xD;
an indefinite length of time. But then if they were riding&#xD;
fast, they could not talk. If they were walking their horses&#xD;
or gently ambling along some green and shady lane, or&#xD;
stopping to enjoy a view, the very occasion furnished a t topic&#xD;
sufficient to prove mutual friendliness, and that sufficed.&#xD;
Rosemary was fond of being left to her- own meditations.&#xD;
Once on this very ride, when they had reached a point where&#xD;
there was a noble view of the ocean, with white sails in the&#xD;
offing, and a. black steamship ploughing along, not a single&#xD;
word was said by either. O'Morra lifted his riding cap and let&#xD;
the breeze play in his tawny locks, as it uttered the hair and&#xD;
plume of his companion; and so he sat looking over the waves&#xD;
in silence. Rosemary talked low nonsense to Arab, patting the&#xD;
horse's black neck, and playing pith his brown mane. Once&#xD;
or twice Rory looked at her seriously, and then she occupied&#xD;
herself still more busily with Arab, and never raised her eyes&#xD;
towards hea young companion.&#xD;

&#xD;
On their return, O'Morra said as they were nearing town:-&#xD;
"I fear that I shall not be able to escort you to-mrrow, Miss&#xD;
Dashon. I shall be absent for a few days."&#xD;
"Indeed !"-With a look of inquiry.  "I am sorry."&#xD;
"I hope that my father will be able to take you to drive&#xD;
occasionally ; but if not, and on days when he is engaged&#xD;
Count Wissen, I am sure, will be happy. He used to ride with&#xD;
me a great deal, and that it may be pleasanter to him, I will&#xD;
leave Sorella at his disposal."&#xD;
"You know, Mr. Rory, that strictly speaking I need no&#xD;
escort but your father's groom-as I suppose I must ride-Dr.&#xD;
Galenson says so-and Arab needs to be daily exercised."&#xD;
"Of course you must ride, Miss Marie. You are accustomed&#xD;
to it, and Galenson says you absolutely require it. He told my&#xD;
father that in spite of your bloom and apparent health, you&#xD;
have not yet recovered your full vigor, and that a great&#xD;
deal of exercise in the open air is indispensable. I hope you&#xD;
will not fail every fine day ; and all the days are likely to be&#xD;
fine now ; the weather is indeed charming ; and Wissen, as I&#xD;
said, will be delighted to accompany you. I will speak to him&#xD;
about it this evening."&#xD;
"I should not like to have the count bored," said Rosemary.&#xD;
"His excellency is not so young as you, Mr. Rory-it may not&#xD;
be agreeable to him to take a daily ride with a chit of a girl&#xD;
like me."&#xD;
"If he does not like it, rely on it he will frame a polite&#xD;
excuse for not doing it. I know the count. You must not ride&#xD;
alone, my dear Miss Dashon-not yet !"&#xD;
After dinner Rory proposed to the count to take a cigar&#xD;
together in the latter's room, which overlooked the bay, and&#xD;
then broke to him what he wished him to do in regard to Miss&#xD;
Marie's daily rides.&#xD;
"Sorry to hear you are going to be absent, my dear fellow.&#xD;
How long ? A whole week ! Doesn't that put the- statue back&#xD;
a little ? I should think you would want to begin'while you&#xD;
are in the heat."&#xD;
It was the very question that had risen a. dozen times to&#xD;
Rosemary's lips, and had been suppressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALMOST A PROPOSAL.             401&#xD;
"It is that very thing sends me off," said Mr. Rory. "I&#xD;
shall never get to work, unless I can break away from here&#xD;
awhile."&#xD;
" Oh, then you are really about to bury yourself in your&#xD;
studio, to make a beginning  --i understand."&#xD;
Rory made an -evasive answer, and M. de Wissen too prac-&#xD;
tsed, a diplomat to be deceived by so young a man, saw that&#xD;
there was something else, and he determined to ascertain what&#xD;
it was. With O'Morra frankness was the best plan always.&#xD;
I see that there is something wtong, Rory, or you would&#xD;
not be leaving us at this moment, or looking for a substitute in&#xD;
your natural office as Miss Marid's cavalier. Still less I think&#xD;
would you be deferring the commencement of this most import&#xD;
ant work. Madam Dashon will be sending or coming here to&#xD;
inquire after you."&#xD;
"I shall send her a note to explain that I am absent for a&#xD;
few days on the business of the monument--that will keep her&#xD;
quiet."&#xD;
"You have not quarrelled with Miss Rose ''&#xD;
"Absurd ! no, indeed."&#xD;
"Nor proposed to her (in the American fashion) and b&#xD;
sagely repulsed (on French principles) '',a      een&#xD;
"I shall never propose to any lady in the American fashi&#xD;
consequently I shall never experience a repulse."&#xD;
"Yet you quit her and surrender your fascinating privileges&#xD;
as host and quasi-frere to another-a rival, perhaps, M  Rory&#xD;
n   above all retire from 'the real source of your hapiest&#xD;
inspiration-for such, with all your talent and marvellous&#xD;
industry, Rosemary. Dashon has been to you, my young friend."&#xD;
Rory gave his half-finished cigar a toss that flung it entirely&#xD;
clear of the terrace, and rising paced the room. M. de Wissen&#xD;
hummed a 'military air, accompanying himself with a very&#xD;
skilful drunimajor performance with the knuckles on the&#xD;
Windosi-s. Then the count, who was smoking cigarettes, lit&#xD;
a fresh one, still not interrupting Mr. Rory's meditation,&#xD;
"I see, Wissen," said O'Morra at last, in a rather grave tone&#xD;
"that unless I explain, you will attribute this move of mine to&#xD;
a cause that does not exist. It is really and solely with a view&#xD;
&#xD;

402                    ROSEMARY.&#xD;
to my proposed work that I am going away. You think, I&#xD;
dare say, that this will be to remove from my inspiration. I&#xD;
differ with you there. I know a good many young artists,&#xD;
prodigiously clever fellows, who work after the method you&#xD;
suppose. If they have something on hand, they look over&#xD;
casts and drawings-fill themselves with the antique-take a&#xD;
strong cup of coffee in the morning-or a brandy cocktail"-&#xD;
energetically striking his open palm-" put their studio in first-&#xD;
rate order-and if they are lucky enough to have a good&#xD;
model, they are all right. Sometimes these fellows produce&#xD;
autiful things, but things in which I feel a great want. Un-&#xD;
less I could do something which to me seems higher, I should&#xD;
quit my art in disgust. I would even go into politics, as my&#xD;
father wishes. It would be better to be President than a mere&#xD;
marble-carver."&#xD;
"Ah! you would rather be President !" said the count,&#xD;
laughing. "Well, I conceive your horror of marble-carving&#xD;
now !"&#xD;
Co This monument, for instance-I could execute it mechani-&#xD;
cally. A simple portrait of Rose Dashon, executed with loving&#xD;
fidelity, would possess a charm. But that is not my idea! To&#xD;
realize my idea, I must fly from her intoxicating presence.&#xD;
She overpowers me with the reality of her flesh and blood&#xD;
loveliness ; my spiritual p6wer is paralyzed, my imagination&#xD;
droops; it is only our present mortal life, her womanly swveet-&#xD;
ness, and earthly bridals, and the mother shining through the&#xD;
maid, that I can think of :-the eternal, the unchangeable, the&#xD;
impassible life, ever virgin, ever pure: they escape me. I must&#xD;
go, Wissen, into solitude ; I must meditate or the Four Last&#xD;
Things ; by fasting, vigil, discipline and prayer, I must purify&#xD;
my spirit till it spring to the height where I wish it to soar."&#xD;
With these words, Rory abruptly quitted the room.&#xD;
"A  singular youth ! Art is his mistress. After all, his&#xD;
method, I believe, was that of the grand old painters and&#xD;
sculptors. Does he not, however, overrate his power when he&#xD;
supposes that by following their method he can rival their&#xD;
works ? His bust in the Exhibition is marvellous, but it is ~a&#xD;
recollection of Rose Dashon, from whom he now flees.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALMOST A PROPOSAL.               40&#xD;
Whether that flight is conscious weakness, or a rare strength&#xD;
of will, remains to be seen. In the meanwhile, M. le comte,&#xD;
-your game is clear. In love as in war, the successful general&#xD;
is he who knows the value of minutes. It is clear that Rory&#xD;
intentionally abandons to me his pretensions (whatever they&#xD;
are) to the peerless Rose. A whole week ! Many a campaign&#xD;
has been decided by the combinations of a week. If I suc-&#xD;
ceed, I shall ask my recall;--in Europe, with such a bride,&#xD;
such a fortune, what position under the throne in not open to&#xD;
a noble? Yet I think that after showing her, 'I would rather&#xD;
eschew courts, which would be fatal to that adorable simpli-&#xD;
city, restore magnificently the ancestral chateau, and live en&#xD;
grand seignewr in the country the remainder of my days."&#xD;
The week passed swiftly. It was the most perfect weather&#xD;
that could be imagined. There were showers in the night,&#xD;
enough to lay the dust. The roads were in capital order ; the&#xD;
country green as an emerald. Count Wissen and Miss Marid&#xD;
(attended by Mr. O'Morra's groom) rode out every afternoon.&#xD;
Cahal 0'Morra did not like it at all, and grumbled at Rory's&#xD;
absence every day at breakfast, and proposed to treat Miss&#xD;
Mari6 to a drive in the dog-cart; but in fact, it was utterly&#xD;
impossible for him to leave court. Madam d'Ehrenstein was&#xD;
secretly displeased that after her consent given, Mr. Rory&#xD;
O'Morra should defer availing himself of it to begin the sittings.&#xD;
Miss MariC doubtless had -her own speculations, but as she kept&#xD;
them strictly to herself, there is no telling what they were. The&#xD;
gentlemen were inclined to bet on the count. Rus6 had always&#xD;
leaned that way. He thought Miss Mari6 (the most discreet&#xD;
young American lady he had ever known) a great deal too&#xD;
wise not to prefer a man of three and thirty to a youngster of&#xD;
twenty-four, who when she was faded; would scarcely be in the&#xD;
prime of manhood. Forrester, who hated foreign counts, and&#xD;
liked Rory prodigiously, was much annoyed at the young&#xD;
man's absence at this critical juncture. He concluded that&#xD;
when the race came off Rory would be "no-where."&#xD;
The handsome and witty Minister, though a foreigner, was&#xD;
not the man to lnt the grass grow under his -horse's feet. In&#xD;
their evening conversations, so much commented upon by the&#xD;

ALMOST A PROPOSAL.           405&#xD;

4O4               ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
boarders, Wissen had entertained Miss Marie with his adven-&#xD;
tures in Africa, where as a young man he had served by the&#xD;
order of his government, in order to learn war in what was&#xD;
then its only practical school. In these narratives his friend&#xD;
clur de lion (as he always called him, while Rosemary's heart&#xD;
beat and her color came and went at the name), frequently&#xD;
figured. Now, in their rides, when there were no listeners, he&#xD;
spoke to Rosemary openly of her father, tracing the resem-&#xD;
blanc between them in features and disposition ; and so, skil-&#xD;
fully advanced to other personal topics ; asked natural ques-&#xD;
tions; and drew her into a full account of her own history.&#xD;
Rosemary acknowledged, and indeed openly said that the&#xD;
count was the most agreeable and fascinating man she had ever&#xD;
met. His breeding was so perfect; among a thousand Ameri-&#xD;
cans of the highest class, she thought, you would hardly find&#xD;
one whose manners were so finished. Then his information&#xD;
was so varied, and his view so penetrating and sagacious. He&#xD;
did not utter commonplaces on any subject, or if he did, he&#xD;
had the art to give them the air of philosophic novelty.&#xD;
This and much more Miss Marie frankly imparted to Ma-&#xD;
dame d'Ehrenstein and Miss Tankerville. Indeed she praised&#xD;
Count Wissen to everybody, and always with a certain warmth&#xD;
of manner: as if anybody doubted that she admired him. As&#xD;
for poor Mr. Rory, his name never escaped her lips. .Mrs.&#xD;
Varick desired Miss Mari6's opinion of Mr. R. O'Morra.&#xD;
" I have seen very little of Mr. Rory," replied Rosemary, ply-&#xD;
ing her crochet : "what I have seen, I like."&#xD;
"Don't you think he is very, very handsome V'&#xD;
"There's no denying that," said Rosemary, with a smile.&#xD;
" And such a genius ! Why, that 'Marble Bride' of his in&#xD;
the Exhibition, is the town-talk, Mr Forrester says."&#xD;
"I have not seen it yet," said Rosemary with a blush.&#xD;
" There ! I have broken my crochet needle."&#xD;
This slight misfortune diverted the conversation from a topic&#xD;
in which Miss Marie evidently took a slighter interest.&#xD;
Nevertheless, as a correct historian, we are bound to relate&#xD;
that Miss Marie about this time had the indiscreet curiosity to&#xD;
visit the Exhibition. It was the first time that she had crossed&#xD;
&#xD;
the Ferry since her convalescence. That is not all. She went&#xD;
alone. Judge her leniently, ye mesdames and mesdemoiselles&#xD;
(fran9aises.) Even the angels fell. Eve ate the forbidden&#xD;
fruit. My own opinion is that it (Rosemary's, not Eve's) was&#xD;
a very venial transgression. The girl had another errand in&#xD;
New York, one that she deemed indispensable. She went in a&#xD;
kind of disguise-black and rose, and a thick green veil. We&#xD;
like to be particular, and have our own reasons for it. Hoops,&#xD;
rigorously speaking, were not yet known, but crinoline (verita-&#xD;
ble skirts of crinoline) were, and of an amplitude that left little&#xD;
to be desired. Rosemary was thus fenced in; a shape that some&#xD;
would have known among a thousand was effectually disguised.&#xD;
What those dark loose flowing robes concealed might have&#xD;
had fifteen years or fifty-till you saw the face you could not&#xD;
tell; and the face, as we remarked; could be seen only through&#xD;
a thick green veil.&#xD;
Rosemary fulfilled her errand, whatever it was, and got into&#xD;
an omnibus to return. As luck would have it, who should be&#xD;
in the omnibus but Roosey Varick ? Roosey took her fare. It&#xD;
was the most fortunate thing in the world that Roosey was&#xD;
near-sighted, and too proud to wear glasses. When he returned&#xD;
her the change, their hands touched. After a few minutes the&#xD;
omnibus filled up, and Rosemary, finding herself next a gen-&#xD;
tleman in what was to her a disagreeable proximity,--had she&#xD;
been used to riding in omnibuses, she would not have minded&#xD;
such a trifle,--pulled the strap and got out. She found herself&#xD;
at the door of the Academy. The temptation was too strong.&#xD;
She tripped along the passage, paid her quarter, bought a&#xD;
catalogue, and entered. After some time she found the "Mar-&#xD;
ble Bride." Before it, on one of the benches, sat grand-&#xD;
mamma !&#xD;
Rosemary's heart beat to stfftocation. She could not resist&#xD;
the impulse to draw near cautiously, till she stood directly&#xD;
behind Mrs. Dashon. Good Heavens ! if she were to draw that&#xD;
veil! The poor old lady, who was alone, sobbed deeply and&#xD;
put her handkerchief to her eyes. Rose threw back her&#xD;
veil rather wildly, and looked at the bust. She immediately&#xD;
saw the portrait-like resemblance, yet so elevated and purified,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6853-00000205"/>&#xD;
406               ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
to herself.  Her eye sank to the neck and its mysterious&#xD;
drapery ; the medal; the pliant robe, so simple yet so expres-&#xD;
sive ! At that instant a shriek burst from a woman's lips ;&#xD;
Rosemary saw a lady sink to the floor, and grandmamma rise&#xD;
to go to her. She did not offer assistance, but drew down her&#xD;
veil, and passing through another gallery, made her way into&#xD;
the street.&#xD;
The question will probably arise in the minds of some of our&#xD;
fair readers whether the count took advantage of those daily&#xD;
social rides to "propose" to Miss Dashon "in the American&#xD;
fashion." M. de Wissen was an accomplished diplomat and a&#xD;
profound student of character. Rosemary was transparent as&#xD;
the finest chrystal,-when she thought fit. One afternoon,&#xD;
when the week was nearly up, the count led the conversation&#xD;
towards the most delicate of all subjects, with a young woman.&#xD;
They were on the very spot where she and Rory had stopped&#xD;
for the ocean view, and where neither of those young persons&#xD;
had uttered a single word to each other. The procedure of&#xD;
the count was infinitely cautious'; but there are some crea-&#xD;
tures,-partridges, or trout, for instance-that take alarm at a&#xD;
shadow. You shall step on a dry stem, and away whirrs the&#xD;
game.&#xD;
" I have been brought up, as your Excellency is aware,"&#xD;
said Rosemary,-" be quiet, Arab !-to consider marriage as&#xD;
something which my parents (in my case, my grandparents)&#xD;
were to arrange for me. Assuredly, in my present position,&#xD;
separated from them, and responsible for my own conduct, it&#xD;
will be my care to avoid everything that may forestall their&#xD;
decision."&#xD;
"I admire your prudence," said the Minister: "it is quite&#xD;
worthy of you."&#xD;
" As for love," said the girl, laughing, and turning her beau-&#xD;
tiful head with an expression of infinite vivacity, "I confess&#xD;
that I have never experienced such a feeling, if it be anything&#xD;
like what I read of, and what the ladies all say it is. Neither&#xD;
have I the slightest desire to be better acquainted with a pas-&#xD;
sion which I observe causes some of my friends to behave in a&#xD;
manner that violates all my ideas of decorum. If I marry, M.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALMOST A PROPOSAL.                407&#xD;
le come, I shall love my husband with all the devotion of which&#xD;
a female heart is capable-I feel that here"-talh&#xD;
somewhere on her white waistcoat : "till then, msentighty&#xD;
for any individual, however deep or tender"-themyi sen ents&#xD;
a little--"will be a secret of my own conscience, the  ortal&#xD;
of which I shall know how to guard from impertinent&#xD;
intrusion."&#xD;
Wissen was fairly puzzled. She spoke too frankly&#xD;
him. It was not clear to him that she meant   y to mean&#xD;
views, at all events,, were most precise and clear. Sheer&#xD;

they had) would be resented as impertinence.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
"DIES IRE, DIES ILLA."&#xD;
&#xD;
" To-DAY at twelve, madame."&#xD;
"I shall be at your service, mademoiselle."&#xD;
At twelve a carriage was at the door. Mrs. Varick, who was&#xD;
always peeping out of her window, specially when a carriage&#xD;
drove into the court-yard, perceived that they were Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra's horses, and the stiff groom as coachman, and de-&#xD;
clared that Mr. O'Morra had actually gone and bought a new&#xD;
barouche for Miss Marid to ride in ! Presently came down&#xD;
Madame d'Ehrenstein and Mademoiselle Mari6, both in elegant&#xD;
carriage costume, and Mrs. Varick said they were going to&#xD;
make calls in New York ; but then Miss M. had a large paper&#xD;
parcel, very big, but very light, which she bestowed with care&#xD;
on the front seat; and then Mrs. V. said that Miss Mari6 was&#xD;
taking backa dress to be altered.&#xD;
The barouche made a rapid course towards the Fulton ferry,&#xD;
but soon turned up one of the streets running easterly, swept&#xD;
round into Court street, as if about to take the road to Green-&#xD;
wood, and after some minutes fast driving, rolled into shady&#xD;
Pacific, and stopped at young O'Morra's studio. The ladies&#xD;
got out, Miss Mari6 took the parcel, and the carriage drove&#xD;
away. A light tap' on one of the valves of the big double&#xD;
door was answered by a workman in leather apron and paper&#xD;
cap, who admitted the ladies without inquiry.&#xD;
The street door, opened directly into an apartment of fair&#xD;
dimensions, the walls stuccoed of a reddish brown, and lined&#xD;
with casts-- busts, bas-reliefs, torsos, complete figures, all&#xD;
helter-skelter. In the middle of the room a settee for visitors.&#xD;
But the workman, saying in a foreign accent:-" You will see&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"DIES IRA  DIES ILLA."&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra-walk this way, signore !" led on to a much&#xD;
larger and very peculiar apartment beyond, to which the first&#xD;
seemed onlyan anteroom.&#xD;
This second piece was about thirty feet deep by forty-five in&#xD;
width, and nearly thirty high, to the flat, open timber roof. It&#xD;
was neither celled nor plastered ; was paved with brick and&#xD;
the light (except what entered from an open door) came from&#xD;
a single huge square window, not only as high as the roof, but&#xD;
by means of a dormer, projecting above it. There were oth&#xD;
windows, but all closed by inside shutters, and barred.&#xD;
There were many casts ranged along the naked brick walls&#xD;
of this vast room, and various curious iron implements hung&#xD;
about; there were several heavy wooden platforms, apparently&#xD;
fitted so as to revolve on their moveable carriages attahednto&#xD;
an upright wooden pillar was a huge crane for lifting weights;&#xD;
beneath it a trap-door. Close by lay a block of whig meights&#xD;
On one side, near the open door, which looked into a arden,&#xD;
stood in the light a marble bust just blocking o, b gadn&#xD;
bloated form; and at a little distance from it, on a bl, a&#xD;
cast which Rosemary recognized a~t a glance aspta  e  bstal, a&#xD;
n the Exhibition. It appeared to be stuck all over with black&#xD;
pins, and she perceived that the marble was to b&#xD;
which the Italian who admitted them was at work.&#xD;
There were other doors, also open; one looked into what&#xD;
seemed a carpenter's shop, with a lathe for turning;&#xD;
into what was evidently a forge, for Rose1ary  rd another&#xD;
lows and saw the sparks fly. On the side by which th  h&#xD;
entered was a plain wooden stair, rising some six feet. The&#xD;
workman, after laying down a tool which he had hitherto&#xD;
carried, ascended this stair, inviting the ladies to follow et&#xD;
led to a door, which he opened with a key astherw   i&#xD;
door-handle, and which discovered another flight, termiati&#xD;
in a room above, over the anteroom, quite Pleasantly fitted&#xD;
up. The walls were brown ; there was a single sqae wid&#xD;
but the floor had a green drugget, there was a square window&#xD;
billiard cloth, several large chairs similarly fitted an angre&#xD;
carved oaken cabinet, a mirror, a table a lar      u&#xD;
portfolios some book-cases well. filled, an old Cremona fiddle&#xD;

in a corner. As everywhere, there were casts; also drawings,&#xD;
and some grotesque sketches in charcoal on the brown walls;&#xD;
but not a single nude: of which below there were plenty.&#xD;
Scarcely had-they noted the many objects in this chamber with&#xD;
the rapid eye of feminine curiosity, while Miss Marie deposited&#xD;
her parcel on the table, when their conductor, after listening a&#xD;
moment, rapped on the door of an inner room, which opened&#xD;
and O'Morra made his appearance.&#xD;
"You are punctual, ladies,'' said Rory, quietly, as if he had&#xD;
parted from them the morn.. "Excuse me for not offering&#xD;
you my hand ; it is bedaubed with clay. Please come into&#xD;
this room. Carlo, you will admit no one, on any pretext."&#xD;
The room into which the young sculptor ushered his visitors&#xD;
was of the same size as the preceding, and lighted in the same&#xD;
manner, but less comfortable. The floor was bare. A few&#xD;
chairs and a table and various contrivances for asculptor's&#xD;
work constituted the furniture.  There were no casts, but&#xD;
quite a number of religious pictures and prints. At the fur-&#xD;
ther end was a large picture in oil, very old, representing&#xD;
Christ's second coming-a glory of angels and saints surround-&#xD;
ing the Lord, above ; below, the resurrection of the just and&#xD;
the unjust. In the midst of the room, on one of the heavy&#xD;
platforms before described, was a tall mass of wet dark clay,&#xD;
which bore about the same resemblance to the figure of a&#xD;
woman, as the pillar of salt in the plain of Sodom does to Lot's&#xD;
wife. On the plain solid table stood a figure in the sante wet&#xD;
clay, and about two feet high, which was even beautiful.&#xD;
It was ten days since Rosemary had seen Rory, and she was&#xD;
greatly struck with the change in him. O'Morra was pale-it&#xD;
might be partly his long dark-green working robe or blouse;&#xD;
but his features were sharp, and almost emaciated ; that fine&#xD;
ruddy firmness of the young man's cheek was gone. His large&#xD;
gray eye shone with a wonderful brilliancy, but the mouldings&#xD;
of the brow and socket, though. still clear and beautiful, were&#xD;
hollowed out. There was a slight severity, if not a trace of&#xD;
suffering about the mouth, the classic lines of which had so&#xD;
deepened that he looked ten years older for those ten days. Yet&#xD;
his whole expression was serene and full of sweetness. Rose-&#xD;
&#xD;
mary, who had been having some hard tho&#xD;
her heart melt.      aughts of him, felt&#xD;
"You have been ill, Mr. Rory ?" she said, her eyes filling&#xD;

"Very well, as you must look at some point in particular&#xD;

"Is the position in which I sit of any consequence?&#xD;

&#xD;
the picture, it is of no consequence. You may change it when-,&#xD;
ever you like. Be quite unconstrained in that respect."&#xD;
"I am glad you allow, me to sit. I supposed the sitting&#xD;
would be a standing."&#xD;
"Not to-day.   Another time I may try your patience&#xD;
further."&#xD;
While Rosemary sat thus, her eyes fastened on the picture,&#xD;
and scarcely seeing o Morra, who stood near his pile of clay,&#xD;
working it with an instrument into shape, he conversed with her&#xD;
in a tranquil tone. She was pleased though surprised at this,&#xD;
for from the rigid silence he had imposed on the countess, she&#xD;
had counted on more than usual taciturnity on his part. First,&#xD;
he gave her a history of the picture, painted by a monk in the&#xD;
fifteenth century. Thence he naturally passed to the subject&#xD;
of which it treated. All representations of so great a theme,&#xD;
the crowning event of human history, but lying beyond the&#xD;
domain of human experience, were unsatisfactory. Rosemary&#xD;
thought so too. Insensibly he diverged to the mighty scene&#xD;
itself. His language, remarkably calm and unexcited, but&#xD;
admirably chosen, became soon the outline of a meditation- on&#xD;
the Final Judgment. Circumstance after circumstance taken&#xD;
from Holy Writ came in to heighten the tremendous word-pic-&#xD;
ture, and in the midst of the scene Rosemary and himself were&#xD;
placed as assistants and spectators.&#xD;
"We may suppose that our purgation will not have ceased&#xD;
before, as it-will certainly cease then. What feelings must be&#xD;
ours, in such a case, when we shall have burst the prison of the&#xD;
tomb, to behold the tomb itself, the solid earth, crumble and&#xD;
melt, and yet feel in our own risen bodies the throb of eternal&#xD;
life ! What a moment ! the wedding again of the flesh and&#xD;
spirit instantaneously co-glorified; a fact of which we shall&#xD;
take note with perfect intellectual clearness, even in the same&#xD;
instant that the Beatific Vision breaks upon us with its infinite&#xD;
vistas of entrancing splendor !"&#xD;
Rosemary's beautiful face kindled like a vase lighted from&#xD;
within; she leaned a little forward and raised one fair arm&#xD;
towards the old picture, as if she would have spoken. .&#xD;
"The resurrection of the Flesh, its glorification, its divii.&#xD;
&#xD;
nation almost, is to me one of the most consoling dogmas of&#xD;
our-faith. That body is immortal already in my opinion; it&#xD;
shall breathe and pulsate, shall see and hear, have motion and&#xD;
force and splendor, while God shall be God. What is the&#xD;
grave ? You have lain in it once, yet now you live ! What has&#xD;
happened to you in a figure shall happen to us all in reality.&#xD;
You ought to feel this vividly-you, once the motionless&#xD;
tenant of a tomb !"&#xD;
From that time O'Morra worked on in silence. At last&#xD;
Rosemary timidly glanced at him-for she was weary. He&#xD;
was not looking at her at all; his bright eye was fixed on&#xD;
vacancy, and his fingers worked, like a blind man's, in the&#xD;
plastic clay. It was a rude human figure, feminine vaguely,&#xD;
nude, black, dripping wet; in the body the posture was nearly&#xD;
all that was evident, and that was roughly outlined; the head&#xD;
was massively brought out, and under the clay hair, clotted&#xD;
and lumped, was a noble face, upturned to Heaven with an&#xD;
expression of wonder, awe, joy and earnest gazing, as upon&#xD;
some marvellous glory.&#xD;
The clock struck three ; an alarm began to ring. O'Morra&#xD;
left off work abruptly, and turning to a lavatory that stood&#xD;
near, purified his hands from the clay. When he had dried&#xD;
them, he approached the wondering Rosemary, took her&#xD;
willing hand in both his, and said:&#xD;
"I thank you, Miss Rose, for this great kindness. Are you&#xD;
well since I saw you 2"&#xD;
"Ah," said madame la comtesse, rising from her corner, "I&#xD;
trust you have had a successful sitting, Monsieur O'Morra."&#xD;
"And my parcel," said Rose. " You have not needed it,&#xD;
Mr. lBory 2"&#xD;
" I shall. You had best leave it. 'Twill be safer here, per-&#xD;
haps, than in your own possession."&#xD;
Whilst mademoiselle in the anteroom   re-adjusted her&#xD;
toilet for the street, the young sculptor covered his clay&#xD;
figure from head to foot with wet cloths, the necessity of&#xD;
which he explained with great suavity to the curious Madame&#xD;
d'Ehrenstem.&#xD;
The carriage came rolling up to the studio door. When the&#xD;

ladies found themselves again seated in it, Madame said,&#xD;
laughing-" You have had a merry time, mademoiselle ?"&#xD;
"Not merry, but agreeable."&#xD;
"I am glad you like it. That poor Mr. Rory ! To entertain&#xD;
you, as he did, with such a lugubrious subject as the Last&#xD;
Judgment! Nothing but a sense of politeness prevented me&#xD;
from stopping my ears. As if it were not enough for a young&#xD;
girl like you to sit for a statue on her own monument, which I&#xD;
observe he plainly intimates is intended for you sooner or later,&#xD;
he must needs call up the most frightful images !"&#xD;
"The day will surely come," said Rose, smiling, "whether&#xD;
we think of it or not."&#xD;
"So will age and death and a thousand other disagreeable&#xD;
things. Indeed, it is shocking manners. What has happened to&#xD;
Mr. Rory ? I never saw a young man so changed in so short a&#xD;
time. So pallid, so wasted ! One easily sees what he has been&#xD;
doing-fasting and praying by himself, till he has worked&#xD;
himself into this extraordinary state of mind. He will not&#xD;
live long, mind that. Why he looks more like a Cistercian&#xD;
monk than a gallant young gentleman, as I tool' him to be."&#xD;
" You saw the angel face, countess, breaking out of that&#xD;
shapeless clay?"&#xD;
"My dear child," said the countess, in German, "it is thine&#xD;
own!"&#xD;
"Everything is judged by the end," said Rosemary. "We&#xD;
shall see how Mr. R ory's statue turns out. As Mr. Forrester&#xD;
would say, I will bet on Mr. Rory."&#xD;
"Sculpture is quite a subordinate thing, after all," said the&#xD;
countess. "Let me take you to Germany, and I engage you&#xD;
shall marry a serene highness at least."&#xD;
" Ah, countess!" said Rosemary, satirically, "you fall far&#xD;
short of my ambition. I shall be content with nothing short&#xD;
of a crown prince."&#xD;
"A crown prince !" ejaculated the countess, seriously.&#xD;
"My child, you dream of the impossible. It is the illusion of&#xD;
very early youth that an alliance with royalty is attainable by&#xD;
any one who has not royal blood."&#xD;
&#xD;
"DIES IRE, DIES ILLA.'             415&#xD;
"C So! Then I shall content myself with an American&#xD;
citizen."&#xD;
" You will always be plain Mrs.," said the countess rath&#xD;
contemptuously.                                  'rh&#xD;
"But do you know, countess," said Rosemary, "that th&#xD;
O'Morras are descended from kings ?"&#xD;
" That is true ?" asked the countess.&#xD;
"As, sure as the pedigree of the Bourbons."&#xD;
"It alters the case," said Madame d'Ehrenstein,&#xD;

THE INSIDE WINDOW.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE INSIDE WINDOW.&#xD;
A WEEK elapsed before the second sitting. Having secured&#xD;
by an ingenious machine of his own contrivance, with gra.&#xD;
duated rules and slides, exact measurements of the figure of&#xD;
his lovely model, whereby to correct his work, Rory told her&#xD;
that frequent sitting would be rather prejudicial than useful to&#xD;
his success. He was not making a portrait, but an ideal statue.&#xD;
The character which in a moment of inspiration he had been&#xD;
able to print upon the face of the clay, was a thing of infinite&#xD;
delicacy, which an unlucky touch might efface for ever. More&#xD;
depended $n the interior conservation of his ideal than on any-&#xD;
thing else. Thetsame sentiment, the same character, had to&#xD;
be expressed in the whole figure, in the attitude, the form, the&#xD;
mysterious handwriting of the planes and curves of the human&#xD;
form divine. Certainly he should require her to sit from time&#xD;
to time, to correct his work, to avoid insensibly passing into&#xD;
some other character which would not be hers, to freshen his&#xD;
inspiration, and give warmth and reality to his idea by contem-&#xD;
plating its living type. In short, he entertained her with a&#xD;
great deal of recondite philosophy, the sum of which was that&#xD;
she would oblige him greatly by sitting for the head and occa-&#xD;
sionally posing for the figure in her simple drapery, which very&#xD;
much assisted his imagination in seizing the true expression,&#xD;
while from the very fact that it was drapery, and therefore not&#xD;
to be copied at all at present, it left his imagination free to&#xD;
act.&#xD;
Rosemary would have been better pleased, had Mr. Rory at&#xD;
the same time returned to the family circle, and resumed his&#xD;
usual habits. She could not help thinking that his motive for&#xD;
&#xD;
doing otherwise was simply to avoid her. She knew that he&#xD;
slept in the house, for she heard his step again on the stair&#xD;
every morning at five ; it was plain that to escape observation&#xD;
he entered at night by the servants' door and reached his room&#xD;
lby the housemaid's stair. Once when she was in her closet,&#xD;
and Mr. O'Morra's happened to be open at the same time, she&#xD;
heard his voice in his father's room.&#xD;
She learned also from Mr. Rory at these sittings the history&#xD;
of his devotion to an art, in which the skill of so young a&#xD;
man appeared at first surprising. He told her of his boyish&#xD;
aptitude for modelling in clay, putty, wax, or any plastic mate-&#xD;
rial he could lay hold on ; how entering college at eleven, for&#xD;
six years he never modelled, because his father forbade it; but&#xD;
learned to draw, in which he far excelled all his class, as he&#xD;
modestly owned ; how, graduating at seventeen, the prohibi-&#xD;
tion expiring,.he returned to modelling with new ardor, got&#xD;
acquainted with sculptors, modelled from the life, and made&#xD;
himself acquainted through books, prints and casts with all&#xD;
the works of the great masters, and the pecu ities of the&#xD;
different schools, till his father got excited, and sent him to Col-&#xD;
umbia for two years to awaken his political ambition by the&#xD;
contest for honors. In fine, after graduating again, with hon-&#xD;
ors-that Rose knew all about from her cousin Roosey, the&#xD;
young O'Morra had given himself entirely to law for six&#xD;
months in his father's office ; was examined and admitted to&#xD;
the bar ; and the next day, making the same choice, with&#xD;
"the governor's" reluctant consent, bought his studio. That&#xD;
was but eighteen months ago, since when he had not been idle.&#xD;
During the last winter he had studied anatomy thoroughly, and&#xD;
Rose knew the rest.&#xD;
Rosemary was curious about many other things, and asked&#xD;
all sorts of frank questions in her simplicity, and those which&#xD;
she avoided or asked in a very indirect manner, Mr. Rory had&#xD;
the sagacity sometimes to divine and to answer. The process&#xD;
of building up a statue greatly interested her. In the first&#xD;
place, O'Morra showed her that there must be a bar of iron,&#xD;
tall as the proposed figure, strong and thick, screwed down&#xD;
into the platform or banker. This barinustbe bent to correspond&#xD;

&#xD;
with the axes of the figure (Rosemary nodded her compre-&#xD;
hension), requiring the forge, and fitted with cross-pieces&#xD;
and spines of wood, strongly attached by wire, to support the&#xD;
clay. This iron passed up through the leg on which the figure&#xD;
was to rest ; the other leg would receive as its bone, a strip of&#xD;
twisted lead ; the arms the same. Then the clay was massed&#xD;
upon this rude skeleton, and the figure moulded according&#xD;
to the idea of the sculptor, but always nude, even if the statue&#xD;
were designed to be draped. The drapery was added last, and&#xD;
required but a few simple folds to give the effect. To adopt&#xD;
any other method would complicate a problem already diffi-&#xD;
cult, and render its execution impossible.&#xD;
Merely to model such a statue as he now proposed, would&#xD;
require at least six months : so numerous were the planes and&#xD;
surfaces, the variations of curve and depression, in the human&#xD;
body, not one of which but must be more or less ideally repre-&#xD;
sented, without counting those minute details which art neglects.&#xD;
And in all this, servile imitation and realism were to be avoided,&#xD;
and the un  of the idea preserved ; a sort of chastity of pur-&#xD;
pose was requisite, a purity of eye and hand, a fidelity tlhat no&#xD;
mere sensuous charm could divert; judgment to know when&#xD;
the true path had been forsaken by the infirmity that waylays&#xD;
all human effort, and courage to retrace it.&#xD;
Rosemary smiled. But if we must or may so far unveil her&#xD;
maidenly thoughts, she began to feel shy of the presence of the&#xD;
countess at these sittings, and was glad to find that as yet the&#xD;
figure, except 'the head, whatever Mr. Rory did to it in the&#xD;
intervals, was enveloped during the sittings in its wet cloths.&#xD;
At home everything went on in a certain humdrum manner.&#xD;
Rosemary was popular, but it was allowed by the gentlemen&#xD;
that this rose had a thorn, and most of them had pricked their&#xD;
fingers with it at one time or another. Even Count Wissen, as&#xD;
we hve seen, did not escape, although mademoiselle continued&#xD;
to ride with his excellency during Mr. Rory's absence, as often&#xD;
as he invited her. When he did not, she had a lady's saddle&#xD;
put upon Sorella, and treated Mlle. Angelique to an equestrian&#xD;
excursion. Every day she contrived to get a glimpse of a cer-&#xD;
tain mournful equipage that was invariably found on the road&#xD;
&#xD;
419&#xD;
&#xD;
to Greenwood in the afternoon.. Grandmamma, of course, knew&#xD;
that superb horse, and the riding-habit, still better : but even&#xD;
on one occasion when Rose cantered by with Count Wissen, who&#xD;
touched his hat to Mrs. Dashon, that lady never took any&#xD;
notice either of horse or rider, and Rosemary, emboldened by&#xD;
this, hovered perpetually in sight. It is very hard:.toesay what&#xD;
emotions were in her filial heart: as a general thing we&#xD;
describe but the girl's conduct, and leave bur readers to&#xD;
fathom the hidden depths with their own soul-plummets.&#xD;
By all this exercise without and emotion within Rose Marie&#xD;
Dashon grew daily more captivating. Not only her health and&#xD;
physical beauty were entirely restored, but a new kind of love-&#xD;
liness breathed over her face and form. The sadness which all&#xD;
very regular countenances have in repose, and which seems to&#xD;
intimate that the superior nature, the angel in every man, is&#xD;
ever mourning over the wreck of humanity,--that spiritual&#xD;
sadness was displaced by a perpetual varying glow of impas-&#xD;
sioned sentiment. What Miss Mari6 could be thinking of&#xD;
excited much wonder. The ladies, of course, went straight to&#xD;
their fated conclusion, and inferred that she was in love. Mes&#xD;
sieurs doubted. Besides their natural incredulity on such a&#xD;
point, what meant those occasional tears--unbidden, yet not&#xD;
bitter ? What signified that quick and keen sympathy with&#xD;
every sorrow, with decrepitude, age and bereavement ? Youth&#xD;
and love cannot realize .these things. The beneficence of&#xD;
Rosemary was a perpetual stream. She gave with both hands.&#xD;
Every more wretched shanty on Gowanus Bay had seen her&#xD;
beauty illumine its dingy cavern. The poor negro 'cabins in&#xD;
the wild, bush-grown vicinage of Brooklyn, whose inhabitants&#xD;
live by petty chores, begging and robbing hen-roosts and&#xD;
clothes-lines, knew her elastic step and almost adored her&#xD;
bounty. The little negro children,.naked as the day they were&#xD;
born, playing in the hot sand of June's longest days, sprang up&#xD;
and trooped round the bounteous girl with delight. She&#xD;
brought them clothes, which their parents afterwards sold for&#xD;
whiskey. She was imposed on by many a tale of feigned&#xD;
distress; but Rose was not discouraged by that; for she knew&#xD;

that she relieved at least an equal number of real necessities,&#xD;
and so she gave on.&#xD;
Mr. Rory kept her purse always supplied. She had occasion&#xD;
once, in a case of pressing necessity--a father dead in a mise-&#xD;
rable cabin, a m ther lying-in, children naked, starving and&#xD;
sick, to go to his studio alone in the morning to ask for money.&#xD;
Charity made her despise rules which to her were more than&#xD;
etiquette. O'Morra was obliged to send over to New York to.&#xD;
get a cheque cashed. He represented that it would take but t;&#xD;
a little while-half an hour or so; still it was far better his&#xD;
boy should go than she, through that blazing sun. He showed&#xD;
her mean ' hile all the curious things about the studio, the&#xD;
marble room, the forge, and when that resource was nearly&#xD;
exhausted, what should happen but the arrival of a carriage.&#xD;
"Goodness, Mr. Rory ! if that should be grandmamma !"&#xD;
He ran to the window of the anteroom, and through the&#xD;
blinds, always carefully closed, perceived that it was in fact&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon's carriage.&#xD;
" What shall I do? Cannot I steal away through the garden V"&#xD;
"The only exit is by the street, unless you can climb a&#xD;
fence twelve feet high. But you can go upstairs, Miss Rose,&#xD;
and remain till Mrs. Dashon departs."&#xD;
"Suppose that grandmamma asks to see the statue'?"&#xD;
"I will tell her that it is impossible."&#xD;
So Rosemary sprang up the stair. She wondered if Mr.&#xD;
Rory would tell any fibs. She turned to him before closing&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"Don't let her come up for Heaven's sake, Mr. Rory. Should&#xD;
grandmamma find me here, nothing would persuade her that&#xD;
it is the first time I ever was guilty of such an indiscretion."&#xD;
"Rely on me," said Rory, going himself to admit Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon, who was knocking with great impatience.&#xD;
"I have found you in at last," said the old lady, giving Rory&#xD;
her black-gloved hand carelessly.&#xD;
"You have always called so late in the day, madam, that I&#xD;
have quit work."&#xD;
"I came early to-day for that reason, you understand. But&#xD;
you are not looking so well as when I saw you last, Mr.&#xD;

O'Morra. Have y 'u been spreeing"-her short laugh-" on&#xD;
the strength of my deposit-eh? Take an old woman's&#xD;
advice, Mr. O'Morra-avoid wine and you know what else:&#xD;
-the double bane of young artists. You have lost thirty&#xD;
pounds in as many days, young sir !"&#xD;
Carlo raised his black pencilled eyebrows into the most&#xD;
expressive arch that ever rimmed an Italian eye, and took up&#xD;
his chisel and mallet to work on the bust.&#xD;
"You will find that I have not neglected your business,&#xD;
madam," said 0 Morra, reservedly.&#xD;
"What progress have you made ?"&#xD;
"The architect who has the chapel in hand has nearly com-&#xD;
pleted the working drawings. The sarcophagus is in plaster,&#xD;
and two of my best workmen are cutting it in marble."&#xD;
"That is something," said madam, somewhat mollified.&#xD;
"Would you like to see: the castings ?"&#xD;
Madam assenting, OMorra led her through the garden into a&#xD;
back building where three workmen were busy. The floor&#xD;
was nearly covered with huge masses of snow-white marble.&#xD;
The sarcophagus was yet shapeless, but against a wooden form&#xD;
were ranged the castings. It was a funeral procession, bearing&#xD;
in the midst a bier on which reposed a young girl in bridal&#xD;
array ; the assistants carried torches; priests, robed and stoled,&#xD;
seemed chanting from books ; behind walked the mourners-a&#xD;
veiled array.&#xD;
"How you have done all that in thirty days, surpasses my.&#xD;
comprehension," said grandmamma.&#xD;
" Those reliefs were designed and cast before you honored&#xD;
me with this commission::-ever since Miss Dashon's funeral, the&#xD;
idea has haunted me."&#xD;
"Then you have had a month for the statue," said grand-&#xD;
mamma. "If you show an equal progress in that, I shall&#xD;
admit. that it is work and not dissipation which has ravaged&#xD;
your appearance, young gentleman."&#xD;
"The statue is in a very unsatisfactory state at present,"&#xD;
said O'Morra.&#xD;
"Let me see it,.nevertheless. I came partly for that."&#xD;
&#xD;
-4,r"&#xD;

<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6853-00000213"/>&#xD;
"I regret that it is impossible to-day, as my model is up&#xD;
stairs."&#xD;
"Ah, you have a model, of course. I suppose that is&#xD;
necessary. Very well, I am in no hurry-I have some other&#xD;
things to say to you, sir-let mademoiselle or madame dress&#xD;
and retire-I will wait, do you understand ?"&#xD;
Meanwhile they had returned to the great studio. Upstairs,&#xD;
a window of the private studio, looking down into this room,&#xD;
had the sash raised to admit air, and O'Morra perceived that&#xD;
some one was peeping betwixt the shutters.&#xD;
"I am very sorry, madam," said Rory, slightly raising his&#xD;
voice, "that I cannot send away my model. It is a young lady&#xD;
with whom I cannot use that freedom; and assuredly she will&#xD;
not come down so long as you are here."-With a smile.&#xD;
Grandmamma frowned, and beat the brick pavement with&#xD;
her foot impatiently ; she was unused to have her will contra-&#xD;
dicted, above all by persons whom she considered to be in her&#xD;
employment. However, Mr. Rory was a gentleman, a person-&#xD;
age, too, who must be humored-as all artists must-and she&#xD;
saw even by his smile that he was immoveably resolved not to&#xD;
gratify her whim.&#xD;
"How do I know, sir," said she, forcing an air of pleasantry,&#xD;
"that this story of the model is not an excuse, to avoid show-&#xD;
ing me the statue ?"&#xD;
"You are very penetrating," said Rory, with a smile. "Its&#xD;
is indeed true that the young lady who has been kind enough&#xD;
to assist me in this work, is upstairs at present; but even if she&#xD;
were not, it would make no difference. I cannot suffer any&#xD;
one-not even yourself-to see the statue of Miss Dashon till it&#xD;
is completely modelled, draped and ready for the plaster."&#xD;
Grandmamma looked pleased.&#xD;
"As I hope that it will really resemble my Rose-who was a&#xD;
pearl of modesty, do you understand?-it appears to me this&#xD;
should be so," she said.&#xD;
"That is quite simple," said the young man.&#xD;
Grandmamma gave him a kind maternal look.&#xD;
"You are the true metal," she said. "I heard that fine&#xD;
ladies visited your studio. Now as for the young lady upstairs,&#xD;
&#xD;
I presume I have seen her very often. She rides a great deal&#xD;
on horseback, does she not? It is very well-she resembles&#xD;
my granddaughter in style-I don't say it pains me, yet I wish&#xD;
she would vary her rides, do you understand? iBut if she is&#xD;
your model, why does she not come alone, to sit, or pose, or&#xD;
whatever you call it ?"&#xD;
"She is very scrupulous in these points ; but I have no doubt&#xD;
if she knew you wished it she would come unattended."&#xD;
"I will not admit," said grandmamma, rather sternly, "that&#xD;
any other woman, any stranger, shall enjoy a privilege refused&#xD;
to me. Tell her that I do wish it. It is ridiculous to say&#xD;
that she cannot come here by herself. This is not like a paint-&#xD;
er's studio; here is a great atelier, workmen about, doors&#xD;
open, forging and carpenter work going on, the click of the&#xD;
hammer from morning till night, and a woman too I saw in the&#xD;
garden, roasting chestnuts for her husband's dinner, I suppose.&#xD;
Anybody can visit a place like this. My Rose would not have&#xD;
scrupled. Besides-now I think of it-if mademoiselle is such&#xD;
a terrible prude, why is she here now ?"&#xD;
This was a home-thrust. Madam said it and eyed the young&#xD;
sculptor askance, in her eagle fashion.&#xD;
" 1Mademoiselle has no objection to simply visiting my&#xD;
workshop," said O'Morra : "but to own the truth, this is not a&#xD;
day of sitting---&#xD;
" Ah, mademoiselle ran up stairs to avoid me !" cried grand-&#xD;
mamma.-" Ha! ha !"-her short laugh again.-" I was too&#xD;
sharp for you that time, Mr. Rory O'Morra !-Well, it is natural&#xD;
but not the less foolish. Tell her from me that were she my&#xD;
very grandchild whom she so resembles, I would trust her im-&#xD;
plicity with you. Would to God she were my Rose indeed !"&#xD;
added the old lady, in a suddenly breaking voice, "and be-&#xD;
trothed to you, as I suppose she is !"&#xD;
The shutter flew open ; Rose, pale as death, and evidently&#xD;
drowned in tears, stood in full sight. O'Morra made a quick&#xD;
Warning gesture. Miss Dashon slowly closed the shutter again.&#xD;
Grandmamma, sitting with her back half turned to the window,&#xD;
did not perceive anything.&#xD;
" You honor me. beyond my deserts, madam," said Rory,&#xD;

gravely. "I know enough of your granddaughter to be aware&#xD;
that I am not worthy of her."&#xD;
"Why not ?" said grandmamma, sharply. "You have youth,&#xD;
beauty, genius, manliness, a noble character, pure descent-&#xD;
purer than hers, poor girl ! I never was more sincere in my life,&#xD;
young sir. If Rose were alive, I would give her to you where&#xD;
you stand-&#xD;
"Madam !" interrupted Rory, unable to control his emotion,&#xD;
"if you have any pity on me, cease."&#xD;
"How far is your work advanced towards completion ?"&#xD;
demanded Mrs. Dashon.&#xD;
"The figure is little more than massed according to its&#xD;
general planes, lengths and diameters," said 0'Morra, absently.&#xD;
"The head is quite advanced. I shall hardly dare to touch it&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Ifnit be the head on which you have hitherto been working,&#xD;
your model must resemble my granddaughter in feature too ."&#xD;
said grandmamma, quietly.&#xD;
" It does not necessarily follow. My model is of great use&#xD;
to me, but the Rosemary that I am transferring to the clay, is&#xD;
in my mind," said O'Morra.&#xD;
"You see her, then ?"&#xD;
"Not as she is, not as she was-but-as I conceive her&#xD;
appearing when her form, raised from the dust, shall burst the&#xD;
tomb, clothed only with its own immortal radiance."&#xD;
"No wonder you grow pale and thin, if you brood over such&#xD;
fancies, young sir," said grandmamma, kindly. "Yet you&#xD;
succeed that way. You have the very trick of my grand-&#xD;
daughter in yonder plaster face."&#xD;
"That is Rosemary dead ; the statue, I hope, will represent&#xD;
her living."&#xD;
"Very well, go on," said grandmamma, rising. "You have&#xD;
told me many things that relieve my mind. I feel a delicacy&#xD;
for Rose that I would not even for myself, do you understand ?&#xD;
were I young and beautiful once more. I was too vain-she&#xD;
had no vanity., I am glad your wife that is to be resembles&#xD;
her. But for knowing that, several things have happened&#xD;
which would have troubled even me. The other day at the&#xD;

THE INSIDE WINDOW.&#xD;
&#xD;
425&#xD;
&#xD;
Exhibition, a young lady-a friend of ours-who has taken&#xD;
Rose's death as much to heart as if they had been sisters,&#xD;
declares that she saw her standing behind me all in black and&#xD;
weeping. The poor girl-she is a little hysterical, you under-&#xD;
stand-gave a scream that frightened everybody in the gallery&#xD;
and fainted quite away. What is worse-my niece Mrs. Varick,&#xD;
a woman of the world, who should know better, went into fits&#xD;
when she heard of it,.and has kept her bed ever since. An old&#xD;
French servant, nurse to my grandchild, has got it into her&#xD;
head that my niece murdered my Rose," added the old lady,&#xD;
in a whisper, and leaning on O'Morra's arm, as they walked,&#xD;
out. "Louise is persuaded that her mistress has really&#xD;
appeared to these two women-to Miss Atherton because shE&#xD;
was her rival; in short, the greatest pack of nonsense you eves&#xD;
heard. I know the explanation-but"-sinking her voice still&#xD;
lower, and speaking in his ear-" I say NOTHING, you under-&#xD;
stand ?-NOTHING. An cTlaircissement would kill Mr. Dashon--&#xD;
DO YOU UNDERSTAND 'F said the terrible old woman, eyeing&#xD;
him significantly, and pausing on the step of the street-door of&#xD;
the studio. " See ! he sleeps quietly in the carriage all this&#xD;
time, and my grand-niece is reading a novel. Good bye, Mr.&#xD;
o Morra. Remember what I have said to you."&#xD;
There was no difficulty in remembering ; much in under-&#xD;
standing it. Did Mrs. Dashon really suspect or divine the&#xD;
truth? He cold not tell. He thought not. But she was an&#xD;
extraordinary old lady. If Rose were actually restored to her,&#xD;
would she feel as now? Would not her ambition revive ? But&#xD;
away with such thoughts. The errand boy was at the door&#xD;
with the money for the cheque.&#xD;
O'Morra trembled as he ascended the narrow stair leading to&#xD;
his sanctum, to find himself again in the presence of Rose&#xD;
Dashon after this scene at which she had invisibly assisted.&#xD;
lie found her sitting on a chair in the ante-chamber, with her&#xD;
bonnet onthe floor at her side, and her face buried in both&#xD;
hands. She removed them as he approached, but did not&#xD;
meet his gaze.&#xD;
.I think, Miss Dashon,".said he, "that hereafter you may&#xD;
venture to come hither without Madame d'Ehrenstein."&#xD;

" Of course I shall obey grandmamma, Mr. O'Morra," said&#xD;
Rosemary, picking up her bonnet and going to the mirror to&#xD;
replace it.&#xD;
"I thought sometimes that your grandmother suspected,"&#xD;
said O'Morra.&#xD;
She turned from the glass, still tying her ribbons, and gave&#xD;
Mr. Rory a glance almost as searching as Mrs. Dashon's own.&#xD;
He was struck with that trick of manner.&#xD;
" She KNOWS, Mr. Rory !"-And the girl turned back to the&#xD;
mirror and adjusted her summery mantle.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
CONCERNING WILLS.&#xD;
WH LE Rosemary applies to young O'Morra to supply funds&#xD;
for her charities, she is really very rich. When her marriage&#xD;
had been fixed and it was necessary to make provision for the&#xD;
support of the young couple, gran apa showed his generosity,&#xD;
and appreciation of her faultless' 1 obedience, by executing&#xD;
a deed of. rust todJ:Atherton securing her the income of.&#xD;
$400,000 ii bonds and stocks for her life, with remainder to her&#xD;
issue, or if she died without issue, with the power to dispose&#xD;
of it absolutely by will. In case she died both ithout issue&#xD;
and intestate, the gift reverted to the estate of the donor.&#xD;
Atherte  gll held this trust, which happened as follows. It&#xD;
will be recollected that Romarin, on his departure for France,&#xD;
settled his cottage property on his granddaughter. The con-&#xD;
ditions were nearly the same, but as she never touched the in-&#xD;
come, which the trustees invested, a small personal estate was .&#xD;
formed ; and by the advice of Mr. Atherton, Rosemary as soon as&#xD;
she reached the legal age of sixteen, made a will, disposing of&#xD;
all the property of which she might die possessed, so far as.&#xD;
subject to her disposition. There was a provision for Louise;&#xD;
one for the goat; legacies of affection to her cousins, to her&#xD;
young friends the Athertons, and to her grandparents, and with&#xD;
a life interest to her grandpapa Romarin in the remainder,&#xD;
whatever it might be (the will was drawn up, so far as form&#xD;
went, by Mr. Atherton), va4ous charities were made the&#xD;
residuary and final legatees, in certain mathematical propor-&#xD;
tions which breathed entirely of the youthful testatrix. Ro-&#xD;
marin's garden comprised eight lots on the acclivity of Murray&#xD;
Hill. It was a year since Mr. Dashon had built on them as&#xD;
&#xD;
'&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6853-00000216"/>&#xD;
ROSEMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
many first-class houses, all which, of course, belonged to Rose-&#xD;
mary, and were let in the name of her trustees. Thus the&#xD;
property ultimately affected by-her will, or by the trust, was&#xD;
$600,000, producing a net income of $40,000, which grandpapa&#xD;
thought was about what a Vicomtesse de Florcal would require,&#xD;
to move with distinction in the society to which her husband's&#xD;
rank would introduce her. If Flordal behaved himself, as he&#xD;
expected (for grandpapa liked the agreeable and handsome&#xD;
colonel), Mr. Dashon meant to do other magnificent things,&#xD;
worthy of a merchant prince,-to repair and refurnish the&#xD;
Hotel Flordal, to rebuild the provincial chateau, and the day&#xD;
that Rosemary became a marquise, if he lived to see it, he&#xD;
would double her index  dency. Dreams of ambition, which&#xD;
not Death only, queller   hopes, but the mere shadow of&#xD;
his bony hand sufficed a'Q&#xD;
Rosemary's will was prolluced' by  er  nge trustee&#xD;
and executor, with whom it had been deposit 6 , was admitted&#xD;
to probate, and the small legacies were paid immediay.&#xD;
From the roteiiess of General Romarin, to whom the iiiome&#xD;
should have been paid, and his not requiring it at Sebastopol,&#xD;
theta rents and dividends went on accumulati     Ywere&#xD;
deposited by Atherton to the credit of his trustee account:&#xD;
but as it all belonged to the living Rosemary, we see that she&#xD;
is far from extravagant, and equally free from indelicacy in&#xD;
her free borrowing, her generous expenditure and her profuse&#xD;
charities.'&#xD;
When Mr. Atherton heard from hils4ughter the story of her&#xD;
adventure in the Exhibition, where Grace thought she lia4 seen&#xD;
Rosemary's spirit, he looked extremely grave. He did not&#xD;
laugh at her, as most of her friends did, nor account for t".&#xD;
incident by an accidental resemblance acting on a morbid .&#xD;
excited imagination, as her mother did; although Grace had&#xD;
been dreadfully nervous and depressed since Rosemary died.&#xD;
He questioned her closely, and cross-questioned her, in regard&#xD;
to the position of the spirit, directly behind old Mrs. Dashon,&#xD;
its dress, whether it had on a bonnet or a veil, the color of the&#xD;
ribbons, the fulness of the skirts, and a thousand things which&#xD;
Grace thought had nothing to do with it, and which, till her&#xD;
&#xD;
father perseveringly examined her, she had entirely for-&#xD;
gotten.&#xD;
"A ghost in crinoline, and wearing a lace bonnet with rose&#xD;
ribbons-it requires a pretty strong faith," said Mrs. Atherton,&#xD;
who wished to persuade Grace that she had been deceived.&#xD;
"I don't see anything improbable, mamma: it only proves&#xD;
that it was not a phantom of my imagination, a spectre in my&#xD;
brain, as papa says."&#xD;
"I am quite convinced that it was neither, my dear child,"&#xD;
said her father. "The form was really there, behind Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon and looking at the bust, and I have no doubt it bore&#xD;
the closest resemblance to our dear Rosemary.".&#xD;
"And do you think, papa, that there is a living woman&#xD;
o exactly resembles her? Would to Heaven I could find&#xD;
er to distractio% for Rosemary's sake !"&#xD;
".Isfl              d that woman, which will be more&#xD;
satisfacto      an  a        easoning on the subject of&#xD;
ghosts," sat her father.,&#xD;
Mr. Atherton, who w  a man of businessut.'i&#xD;
table   d figured up the amount of the legacies he hid&#xD;
und    ass Dashon's will. He also immediately wrote to en.&#xD;
Romarin, advising him not to draw upon him till the expira-&#xD;
tion of the year which the law allows to executors for the set-&#xD;
tlement of estates. The next thing which Atherton did was to&#xD;
find the artist who executed the bust, which bore so startling a&#xD;
resemblance to Rosemar." a son (he understood) of his pro-&#xD;
fessional brother an   itical friends Mr. Cahal O'Morra.&#xD;
Now Mr. Roderick O'Morra (N. A.) Mlas very easily found.&#xD;
The bust in the Exhibition had carried Rory at a single bound&#xD;
to the highest rank in his profession. Had he been obscure,&#xD;
his father was celebrated.&#xD;
It was so late in the season that the Athertons were at the&#xD;
Manor, their beautiful seat on the Hudson. Before the states-&#xD;
man took the train for New York, he took his daughter aside.&#xD;
"My dear Grace," said he, "I want you to summon all&#xD;
your strength of mind and to call your religion to your aid :&#xD;
for you may be invited very soon to make a painful sacrifice."&#xD;

Have you heard again from Col. de Flordal ?"&#xD;
" He writes me by every steamer, sir."&#xD;
" You answer him ?"&#xD;
"'Only once, as you desired."&#xD;
" See now the wisdom of your father's counsel. I am ttm-&#xD;
vinced, my child, from all that you have related to me this&#xD;
morning, that Rosemary Dashon is living."&#xD;
"My father !"    -&#xD;
'  If I am right, she holds the promise of Flordal; he holds&#xD;
hers."&#xD;
"She is living," exclaimed Grace. " Oh, papa ! let us find&#xD;
her immediately."&#xD;
"You seem overjoyed, Grace V'&#xD;
"My father, what are a thousand Flordals to Rose and thy&#xD;

own counsel. If Flordal write ain, return his letters unopened&#xD;
as well as   nsfered. Thus, hapwhat may, your dignity is&#xD;
safe."&#xD;
To return to the subject of wills. It was a grave question:&#xD;
Was Mr. Dashon capable of making a will ? What made it&#xD;
grave has already been hinted by Madam Dashon in one of her&#xD;
free conversations with Count Wissen; yet may require to be&#xD;
stated more fully.&#xD;
While Rosemary was yet at school, knowing the uncertainty&#xD;
of life and the doubts which had4$n cast on her legiti-&#xD;
macy, and having in tVew a generous provision for his niece,&#xD;
Mrs. George Varick, only child of his only brother deceased,&#xD;
and for her children, one of whom bore his name, Mr. Dashon&#xD;
called in his lawyer, the Hon. Daniel Plaidoyer, and annulling&#xD;
all previous testamentary dispositions, executed a will bequeath-&#xD;
ing the whole of his vast property to the said Daniel Plaidoyer,&#xD;
to Alban Ath.erton of De Groot Manor, and to "my beloved&#xD;
wife," Isabel Dashon, in trust for "my granddaughter, Rose&#xD;
Marie Dashon, daughter of my son, Richard Varick Dashon&#xD;
and of Th6rese (Romarin) Dashon, his wife, both deceased, for&#xD;
her use and benefit during her life," and so forth, with remainder&#xD;
&#xD;
to the lawful issue of said Rose Marie Dashon, and subject to&#xD;
the legacies and provisions hereinafter mentioned.&#xD;
To Mrs. Dashon, in lieu of her dower, this will gave the use of&#xD;
the house in the Avenue, and of a country-house on the Hud-&#xD;
son (her favorite residence), and $100,000 a year during her&#xD;
life, and the right to dispose of the personalty by will, to the&#xD;
amount of $250,000 (which was the exact amount of Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon's original fortune, with interest and compound interest&#xD;
from the day of their marriage: which was so stated in the&#xD;
will). To Mrs. George Varick, the testator's only niece, it gave&#xD;
$20,000 a year during life : to her husband if he survived her,&#xD;
half that sum; to each of their children, $250,000, under a&#xD;
trustee-ship, and remainder to their issue. There were num&#xD;
erous smaller legacies, ranging from one to twenty thousand&#xD;
dollars : $100,000 was apportioned to various charities ; eight city&#xD;
lots and $80,000 were appropriated to the erection of a gallery&#xD;
of Arts, with an additional provision for its support and the&#xD;
gradual purchase of pictures and sculpture ; to be called the&#xD;
"Dashon Gallery." In fine, more than a millionrf dollars was&#xD;
disposed of in legacies, being about a fourth part of the estate,&#xD;
excluding from the estimate of the latter the direct gifts to his&#xD;
granddaughter during her lifetime ; i..e., during the period&#xD;
anterior to her supposed decease.&#xD;
All this was excellent; no one could reasonably complain of&#xD;
such a will; but there was one extraordinary provision, which&#xD;
was added last of all, as if by a kind- of afterthought, and&#xD;
evidently prompted by strong feeling, viz.: that if any legacy&#xD;
lapsed by the death of the legatee, it was not to return to the&#xD;
estate, but to be divided in certain proportions between certain&#xD;
public institutions and charities; it being the declared inten-&#xD;
tion of the testator that no individual mentioned in the will&#xD;
should profit by the death of another. There was one excep-&#xD;
tion to this, which clearly showed its animus, viz.: that in case&#xD;
of the death of his grandchild, Rose Marie Dashon, without&#xD;
issue, her grandmother, if she survived, should take the house&#xD;
in fee, and so much of the real and personal estate as would&#xD;
make one-half of the whole, and $2,000 besides, as if the testa-&#xD;
tor had also survived the aforesaid Rosemary, and had died&#xD;

intestate. In short, this provision simply excluded his niece&#xD;
and her children from any benefit arising from Rosemary's&#xD;
death: for it was not to be supposed that Miss Dashon would&#xD;
compass the death of her two cousins in order to add their half&#xD;
million to her immense inheritance.&#xD;
If Mr. Dashon had caused this will to be read aloud in a&#xD;
family council, for the information of all concerned, or had&#xD;
furnished those interested with a copy, or even a copy of the&#xD;
stringent concluding article, Rose Marie Dashon might now&#xD;
be Marquise de Flordal. No doubt he was prevented by the&#xD;
reluctance which all rich men feel to make known the secret&#xD;
of their last will--tile last act of their earthly power. It inti-&#xD;
mated, too, a suspicion which he was naturally unwilling to&#xD;
avow. He probably intended to make this particular provision&#xD;
known, but if so, he deferred it.&#xD;
When Rosemary's marriage had been settled, before she&#xD;
went into retreat in preparation for it, her grandfather drew&#xD;
her into his library one evening, and put this will into her&#xD;
hands for perusal. Rosemary objected to the sum of which&#xD;
grandmamma was allowed to dispose by will a too little;&#xD;
grandpapa (with the sweetest smile) should at least double it.&#xD;
-" Grandmamma loves power," said the sauce-box, "and the&#xD;
more power she has over her Rose, the more she will love me,&#xD;
sir."-" I will make a codicil to that purpose," said grand-&#xD;
papa: "it will be the same thing in the end."-Then the girl&#xD;
put her finger on the final provision. No ! she did 'not like&#xD;
that. In case of her premature death to deprive her cousins&#xD;
of their magnificent natural inheritance! That article grand-&#xD;
papa must expunge. The affair passed through the usual&#xD;
stages ; arguments, in which the young lady is defeated ; per-&#xD;
suasions, which would soften a rock ; caresses that no mortal&#xD;
heart can long resist; and grandpapa tears off and burns the&#xD;
obnoxious paragraph with the signatures of the will, and pro-&#xD;
mises (his grandchild on his knee and her arms round his&#xD;
neck) to execute speedily another in a kinder spirit.&#xD;
In effect, the will was spliced; the remainder of the torn&#xD;
page copied fairly; a provision added, doubling Mrs. Dashon's&#xD;
testamentary power ; and the whole was ready for signing on&#xD;
&#xD;
CONCERNING WILLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
433&#xD;
&#xD;
Rosemary's marriage-day ; grandpapa meant to have it exe-&#xD;
cuted in the presence of the family, immediately after the&#xD;
ceremony-a plan cut short by human malice, and the permis-&#xD;
sion of Providence. The instrument, ready for signature, was&#xD;
found in Mr. Dashon's pocket. You see it is a grave question&#xD;
with all the Varicks: Is Mr. Dashon still capable of executing&#xD;
this will, or of substituting another ?&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon, who has nothing (worth mentioning) to gain or&#xD;
lose, since the will simply gives her her legal share as widow&#xD;
of a childless intestate, considers that her husband is not in a&#xD;
condition to alter a will: hence, what is the use of his making&#xD;
one ? The principal end which a will was to have accom-&#xD;
plished, viz.: to secure Rose in her rights, had ceased with&#xD;
her death. Mr. Plaidoyer, vho was a legatee, Dr. Varick, Dr.&#xD;
Clerestory, in fact the whole Varick connection except Mr&#xD;
and Mrs. (Norge, who got nearly two millions by their uncle's&#xD;
intestacy, considered that Mr. Dashon could undoubtedly make&#xD;
a will. But as nobody had access to Mr. Dashon, except his&#xD;
wife and those whom she chose to admit, as Mr. Dashon seemed&#xD;
to have no initiative except for the daily drive to Greenwood&#xD;
and its mournful ceremonies, it was difficult to see how a will&#xD;
could be made. Still Mrs. Varick lived in hourly anxiety lest&#xD;
her aunt should use her position as she herself would unhesita-&#xD;
tingly have done, to induce her uncle to make a will, and not&#xD;
only a will, but one which, giving a large sop to every other&#xD;
Varick, to Mrs. George's own children even, would convey the&#xD;
bulk of the estate to her aunt herself. Were this done-and&#xD;
it depended on very ni-ce evidences of capacity and intention&#xD;
whether it would be held valid or not-Mrs. Isabel Varick's&#xD;
hopes were destroyed, her crime was fruitless ! That should&#xD;
never be. Against Dr. Varick's opinion that his brother-in-law&#xD;
was still of sound mind, though speechless and paralyzed, she&#xD;
opposed that of Dr. Mannikin, her uncle's confidential physi-&#xD;
cian, that poor uncle's mind was wholly gone. But she did&#xD;
not rest with a counter-opinion.&#xD;
Madam Isabel had a spy on every movement, almost every&#xD;
wvord of her aunt. She never failed to hear of 'every visit to&#xD;
Mr. Plaidoyer ; but so long as Mr. Dashon was not carried up&#xD;

&#xD;
into Plaidoyer's office, so long as Plaidoyer did not come to&#xD;
spend even a quarter of an hour in Mr. Dashon's library, with&#xD;
aunt and uncle and witnesses-matters not to be arranged&#xD;
without observation, when even her uncle's male nurse was in&#xD;
her pay,-Madam George Varick was easy.&#xD;
But the summer wore on ; the Dashons hired a villa on the&#xD;
sea-shore, within an hour's drive of Greenwood; Mrs. George&#xD;
went to Rockaway to watch them better ; and she soon heard&#xD;
of things to alarm and enrage her. One day (Johnson reported)&#xD;
madam made him leave the vault open, and drive away with&#xD;
the rest, while she remained behind by herself.-" It was heasy&#xD;
to understand as 'ow the hold catamaran was goin' for to hun-&#xD;
screw the plate hover the 'ead of the coffin and look hin !"-&#xD;
Johnson took the shortest turn he dared, and when he returned&#xD;
madam was sitting on a garden bench, looking qite pla cid,&#xD;
yet gave him, afore she got in, a side look out of her "hinfernal&#xD;
heyes."-If Johnson's surmise was correct, and Mrs. Dashon,&#xD;
had taken the opportunity to unscrew the silver head-plate of&#xD;
the burial-case, she must have learned what Isabel Varick&#xD;
knew, that the body of Rosemary was not there. Isabel Varick&#xD;
thought she knew what terrible and revolting disposition had&#xD;
been made of it, destroying forever the evidence of her crime ;&#xD;
but she was mistaken.&#xD;
The discovery that the body had disappeared, was sure to&#xD;
come sooner or later ; it had now come. Did aunt at all sus-&#xD;
pect how the robbery had been accomplished'? Day nor night,&#xD;
since the body of Rosemary was committed to that vault, amid&#xD;
sonorous prayers and with tears, and the silent attention of a&#xD;
black-robed and bare-headed crowd,.the key had never quitted&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon's person (as aunt herself supposed), except to&#xD;
open the vault in her presence. Yet in fact it had been out of&#xD;
her custody twice ! Once on the evening or rather the night&#xD;
of the funeral; it was there when Mrs. Dashon lay down; it&#xD;
was there when she rose ; and- in that interval the key had&#xD;
visited Greenwood, had returned to the city, had revisited the&#xD;
cemetery, and had returned to its place, fastened in a black&#xD;
ribbon round grandmamma's yellow neck, and hidden in the&#xD;
folds of her lace-frilled night-dress. Again it had quitted her&#xD;
&#xD;
485&#xD;
&#xD;
custody,-one night; soon after ; in dead of winter; the sn&#xD;
on the ground ; when Isabel Varick and Dr. Mannikin visited&#xD;
the lonely cemetery together, entered the vault, and satisfied&#xD;
themselves ; both, that the coffin was there; and one, that it&#xD;
was really empty ! That was a terrible visit. The next morn-&#xD;
ing, when grandmamma woke, the key was in its place!&#xD;
Surely all this was not to be for nothing.&#xD;
Again: Mrs. Dashon had not been in town or visited her&#xD;
lawyer ; but a very great lawyer, Mr. Cahal O'Morra (name&#xD;
which Isabel Varick had cause to remember, and which she did&#xD;
remember with disgust and a sense of retribution), a gentleman&#xD;
with a smile like the devil's when he comes after a soul that is&#xD;
his, had driven out to the " Willa" inr a " Henglish dog-cart,"&#xD;
and had been closeted with master and madam.&#xD;
Could   hal O'Morra see his way to extract a will from Mr&#xD;
Dashon Judicial to her interests, Mrs. Isabel held it for cer-&#xD;
tain that he would do it. Nor was she long in arriving at the&#xD;
certainty that this was the question which Cahal O'Morra was&#xD;
invited to decide. He conversed or tried to converse with Mr&#xD;
Dashon, talked to him of his property, his will, his intestacy,&#xD;
and convinced himself that that gentleman either did not at&#xD;
present possess the power of origination, or that some link in&#xD;
the chain of intercommunication was wanting. Mr. Dashon&#xD;
was not absolutely speechless, but to articulate was an effort&#xD;
so painful that he could not be induced to attempt it The&#xD;
most striking feature in his case was his moral apathy on all&#xD;
subjects but one. Connected with this was absolute inatten.&#xD;
tion, and consequent lack of memory. He assented, by such&#xD;
signs as he used, to everything that was proposed; agreed b&#xD;
a nod to leave all his property to his wife, and the next minute&#xD;
to give it all to the questioner; he was equally willing to set&#xD;
fire to his houses, and destroy all his certificates and bonds;&#xD;
but at the name of his niece, or that of either of her children,&#xD;
he closed his eyes and looked stern and irritated. Accustomed&#xD;
as he was to the presence of Augusta, it was clear that h&#xD;
merely endured it, like the other sufferings of his condition,&#xD;
and Mr. O'Morra, having called her in to observe the effect,&#xD;
Was satisfied that had she not worn a petticoat (which prevailed&#xD;

&#xD;
over the old gentleman's habitual chivalry), he would have&#xD;
driven her away, as he had her brother.&#xD;
Weighing all things in that wondrously exact balance, the&#xD;
mind of a practised lawyer, O'Morra concluded that nothing&#xD;
was left but to ask Mr. Dashon to execute the will found in his&#xD;
possession. Except the last page, it was identical with one&#xD;
he had executed before ; the last page was in his own hand-&#xD;
writing; the seals were marked, the place for the witnesses to&#xD;
sign designated in the same ink and the same hand; if he exe-&#xD;
cuted it now, there could be but one tenable objection to its&#xD;
validity.&#xD;
"The principal bequest is for the benefit of the testator's&#xD;
grandchild, whom at the time of its execution he believes to&#xD;
be dead : this argues an absence of intelligent initiative hard&#xD;
to reconcile with any degree of capacity to execu  a last will&#xD;
and testament. I believe," added the lawyer, "  t the will&#xD;
can be sustained in spite of that objection, but it is too much&#xD;
to expect that it will not be contested."&#xD;
"Should my grandchild appear and claim under such a&#xD;
will V'&#xD;
" The case would be so much the stronger, but it would not&#xD;
be incontestable. I should prefer in such a case (supposing, I&#xD;
mean, that your granddaughter were alive), to prove her&#xD;
legitimacy ; when she would take the whole, except your&#xD;
right of dower and third of the personalty, as heir-at-law."&#xD;
Grandmamma shook her head.&#xD;
"With such an adversary as Isabel Varick that will be more&#xD;
difficult than you suppose."&#xD;
"Is not some one listening in the next room ?" said Cahal&#xD;
O'Morra.&#xD;
It was only the nurse setting the room a little to rights ; but&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon ordered him roughly away.&#xD;
"Are there probable grounds for disputing the legitimacy&#xD;
of your granddaughter ?" inquired the lawyer. "Is not the&#xD;
marriage of her parents previous to her birth capable of&#xD;
proof ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon, instead of replying, requested the lawyer to&#xD;
step into her bedroom, which was adjacent; they remained&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
9&#xD;
Z&#xD;
;S&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
there together, conversing in a low voice, for half an hour.&#xD;
When they came out again, the lawyer said, with his most&#xD;
diabolical smile :&#xD;
"Then we must make him execute the will, Mrs. Dashon;&#xD;
and I will defend it."&#xD;
It was the opinion of Mr. O'Morra that this act should take&#xD;
place with a certain solemnity, if not in a full convocation of the&#xD;
family, at least in the presence of its more important members.&#xD;
Mr. Plaidoyer, who drew up the will, Dr. Varick, Abram Varick&#xD;
(actual head of the firm), George Varick and his wife, of&#xD;
course, young Roosevelt Varick, and Dr. Mannikin, as the&#xD;
actual family physican, might well be called in. The will&#xD;
should be read to them; they would see that there was nothing&#xD;
in it opposed to their interests. Even George Varick and his&#xD;
wife would find that, Rosemary being dead, the will gave them&#xD;
nearly al at the law would, if their uncle died intestate. So&#xD;
on a certain day all these persons were assembled by invitation&#xD;
at Mr. Dashon's residence in the Avenue; the session took&#xD;
place in the library ; with those named above, Mr. Atherton,&#xD;
as trustee under the will, was present ; the will was produced,&#xD;
read, and by general voice approved. Mrs. Isabel Varick, the&#xD;
only woman present except Mrs. Dashon, objected. The will,&#xD;
she said, was a devise to a person known to be dead ; it was an&#xD;
absurd will; she proposed that a new will should be drawn up&#xD;
in the same terms, but substituting her own name for cousin&#xD;
Rosemary's: that was the only fair proposition.&#xD;
"That proposition robs me of two millions with a stroke of&#xD;
the pen-do you understand ?" said grandmamma.-She tapped&#xD;
her snuff-box.--" I will never agree to it, nor will Mr.&#xD;
Dashon."&#xD;
"Very well, then, madam. Let uncle remain intestate,&#xD;
unless"-with a pious air-" it please God to restore his mind,&#xD;
which I fervently pray for. I will enter into bonds to pay my&#xD;
share of every legacy named in the will which has been read."&#xD;
This offer dreW Abram Varick, Esq., to his niece's side: he&#xD;
thought it was evidently fair, and if sister Dashon would make&#xD;
the same, all the results of the will might be amicably se-&#xD;
cured."&#xD;

&#xD;
" I will do nothing of the sort-do you understand ?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon._&#xD;
" I can't conceive why you want a will at all, madam," said&#xD;
her niece.&#xD;
" It is plain enough," said Mr. Abram. " If brother Dashon&#xD;
die intestate, sister will feel bound to do something, I suppose,&#xD;
towards paying these legacies ; if the will is executed, they will&#xD;
all come out of your share, Mrs. George."&#xD;
"It is a difference of half a million of dollars to me, and of&#xD;
a million to you, Madam Isabel," said her aunt ; "but consider-&#xD;
ing how immensely you profit by your cousin's death, I did not&#xD;
expect you to oppose the proposition."&#xD;
" I oppose it, madam; I protest against it; and I shall con-&#xD;
test the will, if it is ever offered for probate-understand that !"&#xD;
cries Mrs. George. "Uncle is no more capable of making a&#xD;
will than a dead man."&#xD;
This dispute was put an end to by a very extraordinary act&#xD;
of old Mr. Dashon, whom his niece's voice had roused, and&#xD;
whose eye sometimes rested on her, sometimes on her husband&#xD;
and son. Roosey and his father sat together a little in the back-&#xD;
ground. In the first place, Mr. O'Morra, being determined on&#xD;
the execution of the will, whether Mrs. Varick protested or not,&#xD;
believing that it could be sustained in defiance of her objec-&#xD;
tions, took the will from the table where it lay, and approach-&#xD;
ing Mr. Dashon, asked in a firm, loud voice, whether he had&#xD;
heard it, did he acknowledge it, and would he execute it'?&#xD;
"The will, Mr. Dashon, leaves the bulk of your fortune to&#xD;
your granddaughter, to our Rosemary-do you understand ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon shrieked to him in a high shrill key.&#xD;
"Rosemary is dead, uncle-you know that," cries, in the&#xD;
same note, Mrs. Isabel Varick.&#xD;
The poor old gentleman put forth his trembling hand to&#xD;
take the will. Messrs. O'Morra and Plaidoyer pushed the&#xD;
table (it was a small marble-top side-table, that went on&#xD;
castors smooth as oil) close to him. On the table lay pens, an&#xD;
ink-stand, a lighted candle, wax, a sealing instrument-that&#xD;
no formality might. be wanting.&#xD;
To the intense surprise of every one, Mr. Dashon took up a&#xD;
&#xD;
pen. This was a more spontaneous act than anybody expected.&#xD;
O'Morra filled another with ink and substituted it. With some&#xD;
assistance his hand was got to the foot of the page, beneath&#xD;
the writing. "Gentlemen-Mr. Atherton"-said O'Morra, with&#xD;
a triumphant smile-" please take notice of what Mr. Dashon&#xD;
is doing, as you may be called on to swear to the facts here-&#xD;
after."&#xD;
Grandpapa made an effort to write,-he scrawled a word,&#xD;
but it was not his name: it was the word&#xD;
" IF"-&#xD;
There the pen fell from his fingers-he regarded it pite-&#xD;
ously a moment, then gathering up the document, deliberately&#xD;
put one extremity of the scroll in the flame of the candle. All&#xD;
gazed in silence ; as soon as it was fairly in flames, he let it&#xD;
fall on ti table and watched it while it consumed. It was now&#xD;
Mrs. Varick's turn to exult.&#xD;
" Pretty plain that we shall have no will this time," she said,&#xD;
rising, and shaking out her black robes,-the first six months'&#xD;
mourning for "cousin Rosemary,' expiring but not expired.&#xD;
" Pretty plain that here is spontaneity, gentlemen," said&#xD;
O'Morra, glancing at his brother lawyers, Plaidoyer and&#xD;
Atherton.&#xD;
"There is what ?" said Mrs. Varick, sharply, and turning to&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Best not, exhaust Mr. Dashon by questions or conversation&#xD;
at present," said grandmamma. "Brother, I shall be obliged&#xD;
to you all, if you will withdraw."&#xD;
"I think brother Dashon could make a will by interrogation,&#xD;
very clearly," said Dr. Clerestory, as he went out, addressing&#xD;
Dr. Varick.&#xD;
So this grand experiment failed in its main object, but&#xD;
elicited facts of great importance, and alarming to Madam&#xD;
Isabel. Suppose aunt Dashon and Cabal O'Morra, uncle doc-&#xD;
tor (very hostile to her), uncle Clerestory (bent on a legacy),&#xD;
and Mr. Plaidoyer (a regular muff), got together and made&#xD;
uncle execute a will cutting her off entirely? All the relations&#xD;

Atherton, would be ready to testify to uncle Dashon's capacity&#xD;
and independent voliion. He who had burned one will, could&#xD;
give a rational assent to another. Madam began to fear that&#xD;
in opposing the execution of the will she had bitten her own&#xD;
nose off. She concentrated herself in her own dark mind,&#xD;
already familiar with guilt, to discover the means of eluding&#xD;
this new danger.&#xD;
There is an inexorable logic in crime. The commission of&#xD;
one crime leads necessarily to the commission of another. It&#xD;
is the mightiest of problems-insoluble sine deo-how to break&#xD;
this linked necessity which Fate and Nemesis forged. We&#xD;
speak after the manner of the poets. There is a way to cut&#xD;
off the connection, and to reverse the engine, but unless that&#xD;
divine contrivance is resorted to, viz.: repentance, the relent-&#xD;
less machine rushes on to its own dismal catastrophe.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin was still the confidential physician of the&#xD;
Dashons. The skill with which he treated Mr. Dashon in his&#xD;
present precarious condition and the extreme solicitude with&#xD;
which he devoted himself to the case, were too evident to Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon for her to think of dismissing him. Dr. Mannikin was&#xD;
acquainted with a class of agents acting on the nervous sys-&#xD;
tem,-subtle nervous poisons of oriental origin-the names and&#xD;
nature of which he kept a profound secret alike from his&#xD;
patients and his brethren. One of these, in particular, of which'&#xD;
a single drop sufficed to plunge the whole human frame with&#xD;
all its organs and functions into the immobility of simulated&#xD;
death, administered in a diluted form, at regular intervals, was&#xD;
a wondrous prophylactic against palsy.  It was extremely&#xD;
necessary to apportion and regulate its power. Dr. Mannikin&#xD;
watched Mr. Dashon till certain slight premonitions of a para-&#xD;
lytic attack declared themselves, then he would administer a&#xD;
few drops of his diluted extract, and in a few hours the danger&#xD;
would pass. The most formidable symptom was the sudden res-&#xD;
toration of mental and muscular power. Dr. Mannikin checked&#xD;
the joy of Mrs. Dashon on the first manifestation of this fhat-&#xD;
&#xD;
tering sign, by pointing. out to her that it was the sure fore-&#xD;
runner of a fresh and probably fatal attack. At the same time&#xD;
a gradual improvement of the patient's condition had resulted&#xD;
from the treatment. Mannikin had predicted evil from the&#xD;
attempt to obtain a will, and especially if anything like a&#xD;
discussion took place in Mr. Dashon's presence. The sudden&#xD;
exhibition of power and intelligence which occurred under&#xD;
this stimulus, alarmed him greatly. He administered on the&#xD;
spot, in the presence of O'Morra who lingered after the rest, a&#xD;
dose which rendered Mr. Dashon instantly insensible. O'Morra&#xD;
was startled.&#xD;
"It is the only means to save his life,' said Ezekiel, confi-&#xD;
dently. "In twenty-four hours he will revive, refreshed and&#xD;
out of immediate danger: but I will not answer for the result&#xD;
of repeating such excitements and such remedies. Mr. Dash-&#xD;
on's existence depends on that vial, sir,"-holding it betwixt&#xD;
his bony fingers, and relaxing into his skeleton grin..-.&#xD;
"Exhaust itq power by such doses as I have just administered,&#xD;
and no human skill can arrest a second stroke of paralysis,&#xD;
which will be fatal."&#xD;
It is a singular medicine," said Cahal O'Morra. "What&#xD;
would be its effect upon myself, if I took the entire contents&#xD;
of the vial V"&#xD;
"Death in less than forty seconds," said Ezekiel, gravely.&#xD;
It was twenty years since these men had met, and Mannikin&#xD;
had altered so much that O'Morra had not recognized him in&#xD;
the crowd ; but the skeleton grin for which even at twenty&#xD;
Ezekiel was remarkable, revived hks recollection; he glanced&#xD;
at the handsome semi-quaker garb, and said:&#xD;
"Dr. Mannikin, I believe ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon sometimes consulted 'Dr. Mannikin for herself.&#xD;
His relations with Isabel Varick ffr many years past had not&#xD;
been such as to attract attention, and to Mrs. Dashon he often&#xD;
spoke of that lady with biting sarcasm. In fact, everybody&#xD;
must have a confidant, and as the yoke of Isabel often galled&#xD;
Mannikin severely, it was a necessity to unburden his irritation&#xD;
on the subject to somebody. He soon found that grandmamma&#xD;
Dashon was a person with whom it was perfectly safe to sneer&#xD;

at her niece, and by a refinement of prudence, Ezekiel let Mrs.&#xD;
Varick know that he did not spare her in conversation with her&#xD;
aunt, ascribing it to policy. Isabel approved, and kept her&#xD;
opinion as to the motive to herself.&#xD;
Apart from the danger that Mrs. Dashon would induce her&#xD;
husband to make a will bequeathing his entire property to her-&#xD;
self, there was the certainty that if Mr. Dashon, whose life&#xD;
hung by a thread, died first, her aunt, as widow, would take&#xD;
without a will half the estate. There was one occurrence,&#xD;
possible in the ways of Providence, which would preclude both&#xD;
these contingencies. Aunt Dashon in spite of her vigorous age&#xD;
and iron constitution, might die before her nearly bedridden hus-&#xD;
band, the care of whom would then devolve upon his affectionate&#xD;
niece, his only kinswoman and sole heir.&#xD;
If Mannikin had been disinclined to serve Isabel Varick, or&#xD;
recalcitrant to the secret despotism she exercised over him, his&#xD;
hatred of O'Morra, and wish to foil O'Morra's designs, would have&#xD;
helped to render him subservient to her wishes. It was a strange&#xD;
approximation which brought these two men, one as legal, the&#xD;
other as medical adviser of grandmamma Dashon, to consult&#xD;
together on the possibility and safety of means to elicit from&#xD;
grandpapa Dashon a new will. O'Morra calmly took for&#xD;
granted that ]Mannikin knew Rosemary to be living. He was.&#xD;
not long in discovering indubitable proof that of this fact Mrs.&#xD;
Isabel Varick was totally ignorant, and that Mannikin was&#xD;
sincerely apprehensive of the consequence of her discovering&#xD;
it. It was evident, therefore, that Mannikin had betrayed his&#xD;
accomplice from the first,. The womati had meant murder,&#xD;
while the man intended merely to prevent the marriage of the&#xD;
heiress and to get her into his power, to let her owe her life to&#xD;
his skill, and to force her, perhaps, if fair means failed,-to&#xD;
what 'i since Mrs. Mannikin lived under O'Morra's eye. Manni-&#xD;
kin's power was undoubtedly very great, and had that poor Mrs.&#xD;
Grace died as suddenly as Rose Dashon, O'Morra pondered&#xD;
deeply the possibility of tracing her death to her husband.&#xD;
Mannikin several times dosed Mr. Dashon, when in a profound&#xD;
lethargy, by causing him simply to inhale the fumes_ of the&#xD;
medicine; and when O'Morra proposed laughingly to smell&#xD;
&#xD;
the open bottle, the physician objected, and stated that it was&#xD;
dangerous. He was careful, O'Morra observed, to keep the&#xD;
vial stopped,. and admitted,' on being questioned, that the&#xD;
active principle was one of the most volatile in existence, and&#xD;
absorbed by the animal system with incredible rapidity. The&#xD;
pertinacious scrutiny of the lawyer was very irksome to the&#xD;
physician; but O'Morra, contrary to his usual custom, was&#xD;
bland as oil, he never uttered a sarcasm, and seemed to have&#xD;
forgotten and forgiven Ezekiel's youthful peccadilloes,&#xD;
O'Morra did not content himself with soft looks and hoie&#xD;
speeches, of which his glib tongue was very capable. He mad ;.&#xD;
distinct and magnificent promises. If Mannikin would get Mr.&#xD;
Dashon into a condition in which he could see his grandchild&#xD;
without risk of his life, and be enabled to make a will in her favor,&#xD;
he engaged on the part of Mrs. Dashon and Rosemary, a fee&#xD;
that would make him independent for life. Ezekiel promised&#xD;
to do it, but asked for time. Under the influence of this&#xD;
splendid promise he expressed his sincere conviction that Mr.&#xD;
Dashon's life, excluding violent emotion, might be prolonged&#xD;
for years, and that he might even recover the use of his mental&#xD;
faculties, though not, Mannikin thought, that of his limbs&#xD;
which were hopelessly paralyzed and atrophied.&#xD;
O'Morra was satisfied that Mannikin was sincere, but after&#xD;
long reflection he determined to clench the business by holding&#xD;
out an inducement greater still., Mannikin had hinted at&#xD;
another reward. O'Morra engaged that Mrs. Grace, i. e., Mrs.&#xD;
Mannikin, should remove into another State, and bring a suit&#xD;
for divorce on the ground of infidelity and desertion. It would&#xD;
be a bitter pill for Mannikin to let such'a suit go by default,&#xD;
but it would scarcely be known ; and he would be free to&#xD;
marry whomsoever he liked.&#xD;
" As you are an unbaptized infidel," said O'Morra, glancing&#xD;
at Ezekiel's garb and for once relapsing into his bitterest smile&#xD;
" Mrs. Grace can have n&amp;amp;conscientious scruples."&#xD;
Mannikin's eyes fairly flashed with joy: in his gratitude he&#xD;
even hinted that he could do something for Miss Dashon that&#xD;
nobody suspected to be possible. What it was, he refused to&#xD;
say.&#xD;

LETTERS AND LOVE-S  ENES.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
LETTERS AND LOVE-SCENES.&#xD;
IN order not to confuse events, we have sketched the opera-&#xD;
tions of Cahal O'Morra and grandmamma down to the begin.&#xD;
ning of August. To trace fairly the history of Rosemary'&#xD;
herself, we must go back to the day, towards the end of June,&#xD;
when Mrs. Dashon nearly surprised her at Rory's studio and&#xD;
talked in such a manner as to convince the young lady that her&#xD;
grandmother knew everything. We shall not dwell on this&#xD;
supposition, for well-founded as it seemed to be, it was incorrect.&#xD;
Grandmamma's blind faith in the inviolability of her vault and&#xD;
the integrity of her servants was not so easily disturbed. Like&#xD;
other incredulous people, once she had adopted an hypothesis&#xD;
no apparently conflicting fact had the least influence on her&#xD;
mind. Incredulity is but an overweening faith in our own&#xD;
infallibility. Mrs. Dashon did not conceive it possible that she&#xD;
could be outwitted, hoodwinked, deceived and betrayed. Let&#xD;
us turn to another grandparent, whom we ought not to forget.&#xD;
The cannon of his batteries silencing the fire of the great&#xD;
Todleben, did not allow the world to forget Gen. Romarin. In&#xD;
the spring operations of '55 he was noted for a quality which&#xD;
in an officer of the highest rank tells on the morale of the ser-&#xD;
vice-contempt of danger amounting almost to rash exposure&#xD;
of life. Date: the return of Col. Floral from a mission to the&#xD;
United States, about the first of March. The military laws&#xD;
permit slight mourning, but 'there were the deepest weeds&#xD;
henceforth in the old officer's bronzed face, in the long fall of his&#xD;
snow-white mustache, and the gleam of his wintry eye.&#xD;
Floral, too, seemed to grieve deeply, for Rose, whose&#xD;
beauty, talent, grace and virtue, he never wearied of praising to&#xD;
&#xD;
her grandfather. The young noble had derived no benefit&#xD;
from his engagement : even the princely gift destined by Mr.&#xD;
Dashon for his son-in-law, and which would have doubled&#xD;
Floral's income, he had sent back from Paris, in a graceful&#xD;
letter entirely French,-a pointed epigrammatic commentary&#xD;
on the famous text, Noblesse oblige.&#xD;
After three months, in the trenches on a sweltering day of&#xD;
earlyJune, an orderly brought Gen. Romarin a letter. It was&#xD;
a spot sheltered from the cannonade indicated by white smokes&#xD;
issuing from the Russian works, by a constant reverberating&#xD;
thunder that shook the air, and by a cloud that overhung and&#xD;
partly hid the long circuit of the defences: but now and then&#xD;
a shell came whizzing overhead. All in calmly superintending&#xD;
an operation of importance, by which he meant to silence the&#xD;
fire of one of Todleben's batteries, the old general of artillery&#xD;
glanced at'the superscription.&#xD;
"lMon Dieu! It is from her! Ah, soie old letter that has&#xD;
been delayed-I cannot open it."&#xD;
With a hand that never trembled from fear, but was now&#xD;
suddenly tremulous, the, old, officer placed the letter in his&#xD;
breast, and then issued a brief order. A shell plumped into&#xD;
the trench, almost at his teet.&#xD;
"Yes: let the good God take me at the post of duty, with&#xD;
her handwriting on my heart !" murmured Romarin, tranquilly&#xD;
regarding the fatal missile.&#xD;
A young sergeant rushed forward at the risk of his life, and&#xD;
extinguished the fuse of the shell.&#xD;
"You have saved my life, my gargon," said Romarin.&#xD;
" What harm had I ever done you ?"&#xD;
"You are too careless, my general,' replied the soldier.&#xD;
Romarin took out the letter to examine the postmarks. It&#xD;
was an official, almost mechanical curiosity, to ascertain by&#xD;
whose negligence a letter for Gen. Romarin had been delayed&#xD;
or mis-sent. Among the stamps of the French civil and military&#xD;
post-offices,, all in due form, his practised eye distinguished&#xD;
immediately the American postmark, in which nothing abso-&#xD;
lutely was legible but the word "APRIL," and the figures "55."&#xD;
He started--trembled.&#xD;

" Strange ! I will open it."&#xD;
His eye went immediately to the date at the head of the&#xD;
letter-Rose's business-like custom :-it was the same date,&#xD;
clear as her brilliant hand could make it-" Brooklyn, L. L;&#xD;
APRIL 21, 1855."d&#xD;
The letter nearly fell from his hands. With trembling eager-&#xD;
ness, he read on:-&#xD;
"DEAR GRANDPAPA : From the borders of the grave your&#xD;
rescued Rose embraces you with inexpressible tenderness.&#xD;
Yes, I live! Thank the Giver and Preserver of life.&#xD;
"To my grandparents Dashon it is not yet known. How it&#xD;
has happened is too long a story and the force to explain it&#xD;
fails me. You know, perhaps better than I, all that has hap-&#xD;
pened to poor grandpapa Dashon. Separated from all other&#xD;
friends, nearly the victim of a crime, I ask your counsels, your&#xD;
commands. My present situation is not suitable, but how and&#xD;
when shall I terminate it? Yet I ought to say that I am with&#xD;
kind friends, and that all my wants are supplied.&#xD;
"I ask you, my grandfather, one relief which will greatly&#xD;
disembarrass me. Inform my cousin Floral, I beseech you,&#xD;
that I live, and demand of him the surrender of the promise&#xD;
which yet hinds me to him. I have no, cause to complain of&#xD;
my cousin. He has acted like a man of' honor: I expect that&#xD;
he will do so now. For the rest, not even your commands, my&#xD;
grandfather, will compel me to marry him. To say that, is to&#xD;
say all. I require the formal release of my pligh ed troth, and&#xD;
I require it instantly. Sooner than fulfil it, I will die a&#xD;
thousand deaths. Should he even seek to alter my resolution,&#xD;
I shall take refuge in a convent. I entreat you, as you hold&#xD;
me dear and believe me true, to read to him or let him read&#xD;
these irrevocable words.&#xD;
"Heaven watch over you and hasten the time that shall&#xD;
restore me to your knee and to your arms. Like you, my&#xD;
grandfather, by the help t-f God, your Rosemary will be faith-&#xD;
ful to every duty, cost what it may. Sometimes I think that&#xD;
you are wounded-I imagine you dying-and would gladly, if&#xD;
that were permitted, fly to tend you. Then I think with shame&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
that my weak affection would thus render a hero ridiculous,&#xD;
and I blush for my false enthusiasm, Yet it is lucky, vieuz&#xD;
soldat ! that I am such a woman that no disguise could conceal&#xD;
my sex, or I should be tempted now to seek the lines of&#xD;
Sebastopol en garcon, to be near you and share your dangers,&#xD;
if not your glory. See, your daughter prattles and laughs !&#xD;
Be convinced, then, that she is the same, although she has&#xD;
been the inmate of a tomb! For how many hours I lay aban-&#xD;
doned, defenceless, by the side of my heroic father, I know&#xD;
not ; but assuredly under that protection not my honor alone&#xD;
but my delicacy was safe. Once only was the latter endan-&#xD;
gered, when an unknown hand defended your Rose from&#xD;
profanation. Kissing those white hairs,&#xD;
"Your own&#xD;
"ROSE MARIE."&#xD;
This vivacious and impassioned letter was written, as we&#xD;
already know, during Rosemary's convalescence, before she&#xD;
had quitted her room. The date is important as it shows us&#xD;
that her determined tone in regard to her nuptial promise,&#xD;
proceeded from no change in her consequent on new acquaint-&#xD;
ances, but solely from the light which she possessed in regard&#xD;
to the feelings of her betrothed. She might have held herself&#xD;
free, when in her presence on their bridal morn, believing her&#xD;
dead, he had given faith to another ; but although Rose took&#xD;
note of that internally, she'considered herself bound to demand&#xD;
a formal release. Months have elapsed; she has passed already&#xD;
an ordeal severe enough for any young woman with a dis-&#xD;
engaged heart ; yet, except to Count Wissen, her father's&#xD;
friend and Flordal's also, who knew the whole affair from its&#xD;
inception, has she never breathed a word incompatible with the&#xD;
faith of a woman betrothed.&#xD;
We have seen that when grandmamma seemed to offer her,&#xD;
and according to Rosemary's interpretation did offer her, to&#xD;
Rory O'Morra, Rose threw open the shutters behind which she&#xD;
listened, to speak: but young O'Morra prevented her. When&#xD;
her grandmother s gone, she evidently awaited-and desired&#xD;
an opportunity f:; explanation, which O'Morra avoided. When&#xD;

she reached home, she sat ,down and wrote him a note, which&#xD;
is abou.   most dangerous thing a young woman can do. It&#xD;
ran as follow:-                     -&#xD;
" RODERICK O'MoRRA, Esq.&#xD;
"Forgive me for shrinking&#xD;
from the bare possibility that you may mistake my silence&#xD;
after what grandmamma said this morning in my hearing.&#xD;
Were my hand in my own, that is, in my parents' disposal, I&#xD;
would say nothing: for if you understood grandmamma, it&#xD;
would be well; if you did not, it would still be well. But my&#xD;
cousin, the colonel vicomte de Flordal, holds my promise. I&#xD;
am sure that your generous interpretation will assign as the&#xD;
motive of this note the simple wish to guard my own delicacy&#xD;
and your happiness."ROSE MARIE."&#xD;
It cost her a great deal to write, fold, address, seal and des..&#xD;
patch the above: but Rose was convinced it was her duty.&#xD;
Without a clear understanding on the subject she felt it to be&#xD;
impossible to visit Mr. Rory's studio again, above all alone,&#xD;
as grandmamma desired. The answer was prompt and cha-&#xD;
racteristic.&#xD;
"Saturday, June 23.&#xD;
"MADEMOISELLE: 'l,           y&#xD;
"I have always&#xD;
regarded you as an affianced bride ; but although your warn-&#xD;
ing is thus superfluous for me, I feel its kindness and appreci-&#xD;
ate its delicacy in my inmost heart. Permit me to subscribe&#xD;
myself,&#xD;
myself,"Mademoiselle,&#xD;
"With the highest esteemS&#xD;
"and fraternal regard,&#xD;
" Devotedly yours,&#xD;
" RORY O'MoRRA.&#xD;
"Miss RosE MARIE DASHON."&#xD;
Had? Rosemary been like some great diplomats we know,&#xD;
&#xD;
LETTERS AND LOVE-SCENES.            449&#xD;
she would have written a second letter to explain her first.&#xD;
For, had she not, in the first place, fairly given Mr. R. O'M. to&#xD;
understand that were her promise out of the way she had no&#xD;
other objection to grandmamma's proposal? Secondly, had&#xD;
she not implied her belief that Mr. R. O'M. himself was in&#xD;
danger from her attractions, &amp;amp;c.? Lastly, had she not repre-&#xD;
sented herself as a girl without heart, without pride, ready to&#xD;
be thrown to this or that as her parents determined, only safe&#xD;
to consider a bargain a bargain? Her note had been laid&#xD;
upon Mr. Rory's table, after dinner ;-he came in (she thought)&#xD;
about nine, and in fifteen minutes after his answer reached&#xD;
her. Rapid, decided person Mr. Rory O'Morra.&#xD;
Despite herself Rose thought of him incessantly. Why did&#xD;
he not come to his meals? Why was he so thin and gaunt?&#xD;
The ladies all could tell that Mr. Rory was in love with her,&#xD;
and that jealousy of the count, and her perpetual flirting with&#xD;
his foreign excellency, had exiled the youth from the house,&#xD;
deprived him of rest and appetite, and was wearing away his&#xD;
health and life. Ladies will say such things, or hint them, or&#xD;
report them as having been said by others. Rosemary did not&#xD;
believe too much of all that. She had too profound a respect&#xD;
for Rory to credit his pining like a love-sick girl. His candid,&#xD;
fraternal manner indicated nothing of the sort. He would be&#xD;
insane were he jealous of M. de Wissen. Besides, she had her&#xD;
ideas and some experience of the higher discipline of the soul;&#xD;
the lines of Rory's pallid mouth, though disguised by a brown&#xD;
mustache some six weeks old, indicated physical, not moral,&#xD;
suffering ; and the soft flash of his princely eye (it was the&#xD;
only term she could think of) expressed not sentimental weak-&#xD;
ness, but the energy of productive power. Altogether she&#xD;
formed a'pretty accurate opinion of the immediate cause of&#xD;
the young sculptor's too refined spirituality of appearance,&#xD;
but why it was necessary, she could not divine ; was it neces-&#xD;
sary, she doubted; how it would end, she feared.&#xD;
Rory ate little (had she not lighted on his dinner just&#xD;
brought in, one day after her sitting?), worked much, and&#xD;
exercised severely. He had taken lately to company drill, as she&#xD;
learned from Ernest Claviger, and the two morning hours once&#xD;

devoted to the gymnasium, were now occupied in the severest&#xD;
training of the new school. Sorella was abandoned to Count&#xD;
Wissen, that is, to herself ; but Rory O'Morra got rid of his&#xD;
superfluous energy in base ball, cricket, boating and swimming.&#xD;
Forrester told Miss 'Tankerville; who told Miss Marie. that&#xD;
Rory's muscles were like springs of steel, but that he never saw&#xD;
a young man, not even a prize-fighter in condition, with so&#xD;
little fat on his ribs, and that if the boy did not hold up in his&#xD;
training, he would die of consumption. Rose herself, whose&#xD;
tendency was to what O'Callaghan (you don't forget O'Cal-&#xD;
laghan?) would call the "deposition of adipose tissue," could&#xD;
easily conjecture by the distinctness of the muscles in that&#xD;
white sinewy throat, and the gaunt shapeliness of the young&#xD;
man's figure, how it must be. She even feared worse impru-&#xD;
dences than over-exercise, under-feeding, and mental excite-&#xD;
ment ; she wished she were Rory's sister, that she might talk&#xD;
to him frankly ; for thank Heaven ! whatever ailed the youth,&#xD;
it was nothing a sister might not know, or of which a sister&#xD;
might not speak. The indiscretion, not being a sister in reality,&#xD;
of attempting to act a sister's part, was one of which Rosemary&#xD;
Dashon could never be guilty.&#xD;
Miss Marie was saved an embarrassment at this juncture by&#xD;
Madame d'Ehrenstein's going with Ang6lique to a watering-&#xD;
place for the summer. Other changes occurred in the family.&#xD;
Forrester set off for New Brunswick on a sporting expedition.&#xD;
Mrs. Seymour went to her father's in the country, not'to return&#xD;
till October, with expectations in regard to that return, which&#xD;
Miss Marie, not being totally blind, could guess without being&#xD;
told. Count Wissen talked hard of a Western tour, and Miss&#xD;
Mari6, agreeable as he was and infinitely attentive to her,&#xD;
wished with all her heart that he would go and not return till&#xD;
.-.she knew not precisely what term to fix upon-not her own&#xD;
marriage, for she had not the most remote idea of ever being&#xD;
married. Well, then, till he was cured of a foolish passion for&#xD;
an insensible girl, who, she began to fear,'would never feel&#xD;
any man's merit great enough, not to dislike him from the&#xD;
moment thatlhe seemed to regard her in a certain light which&#xD;
every day grew toShi more and more incomprehensible. She&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
comprehended it in women, and rather despised them there-&#xD;
for, but a man-how could he be passionately interested in&#xD;
anything but the doing of great things, or the creation of great&#xD;
works ? Like Rory O'Morra, for instance, whose art was his&#xD;
mistress, and who to serve her worthily, trampled his inferior&#xD;
nature beneath his feet ! That was a kind of man-seraph whom&#xD;
Rose could half adore ; yet even he would sink in her esteem,&#xD;
if she saw him on his knees to her !&#xD;
Besides these, there was that petted Mrs. Laura Varick,&#xD;
sister of Miss. Tankerville: she was going to Rockaway, and&#xD;
Rosemary was glad of it. Laura Varick was always observing&#xD;
her; and lately she had learned somehow that her husband's&#xD;
cousin, Miss Dashon, the great heiress, had died last winter&#xD;
(strange they did not hear of it sooner), and Mrs. Varick hoped&#xD;
that Dashon (her naval husband) would come in for a fair&#xD;
''hare of old Mr. Dashon's fortune. This particular subject,&#xD;
and how the "captain" had been thought of for Miss Dashon,&#xD;
and didn't like her, and how plain she was, and a queer&#xD;
frenchified girl, and not at all popular with the Varicks, Laura&#xD;
delighted to pursue with Miss Mari6. Ernest Claviger too, the&#xD;
young man among them all whom Miss Marie really liked best,&#xD;
and with whom one incautious evening she was absolutely drawn&#xD;
into a long conversation on art and music,-he was going to&#xD;
England on business ; and Miss Marie, to her intense mortifi-&#xD;
cation, was obliged to submit to a declaration from Ernest, that&#xD;
brought all the innocent blood to her face. She blushed so&#xD;
extremely and expressed so much and so humble a regret, that&#xD;
in spite of her gentle but resolute refusal, he went away con-&#xD;
vinced that he should succeed better on his return., Only the&#xD;
musical Miss Graves, who was avowedly over head and ears in&#xD;
love with Rory O'Morra, and the bitter Ruse, never weary of&#xD;
lashing her for the avowal, remained. Rose Dashon was weary&#xD;
of boarding-house life, though she was not sorry to have seen&#xD;
it, in what was confessedly its'best aspect. Then the heat was&#xD;
becoming oppressive; you couldn't ride before six without&#xD;
suffering; Rose wore a great flat when she went to the studio,&#xD;
and white muslin dresses week in and week out.&#xD;

&#xD;
In the meantime, she went to Mr. Rory O'Morra's studio&#xD;
twice a week, with filial duty for her warrant and her innocence&#xD;
as her safeguard. Mr. Rory was more than ever austere and&#xD;
simple. The first time undoubtedly was a great trial to Rose,&#xD;
like a first battle to a recruit. It was in contravention of all&#xD;
the ideas in which she had been sedulously educated, except&#xD;
one, which was that of unquestioning obedience. So she did&#xD;
as the young soldier does, whose heart beats, or stops beating,&#xD;
not to speak of the inordinate action of less dignified organs,&#xD;
yet he presses forward, looks as fierce as he can, and with a&#xD;
faint cheer, Vive l'empereur !-rushes straight into a battery.&#xD;
By degrees she found these sittings extremely pleasant. Her&#xD;
conscience was quite at ease, and so was Mr. Rory. She saw&#xD;
the greit advantage to him of her being alone. She was not&#xD;
ashamed to pose as much as he wanted, in whatever way he&#xD;
prescribed. He explained so clearly in what way it was of u&#xD;
to him. The dependence of the ideal upon the real, and the&#xD;
transformation of the real by the ideal, she never before un-&#xD;
derstood. It is needless to say that there was nothing in the&#xD;
slightest degree repugnant to her modesty, except that sove-,&#xD;
reign eye, that too intelligent hand ; an eye to which the&#xD;
faintest line could teach so much more than it seemed to reveal;&#xD;
a hand that could record all that evidence and all those&#xD;
deductions with infallible accuracy, and yet with such almost&#xD;
inconceivable elevation and purity of aim. The expression&#xD;
which had so won her in the clay face,-perfected there, began to&#xD;
diffuse itself over the entire form: the arm that was lifted&#xD;
with welcome, the knee just bending in adoration, the foot&#xD;
that sprang from the eartl\in joy, the love, the modesty, the&#xD;
conscious life and splendor tflnt breathed in the glorious shape,&#xD;
made of the whole one expressive face. Lines and forms&#xD;
which in nature seemed to express mechanical force or vital&#xD;
function; in that intelligible clay were instinct with spirit. The&#xD;
dark, unsightly vehicle in which the sculptor worked had at&#xD;
first stood partly between her artI the form; by degrees this&#xD;
obstacle had vanished, and the pure form appeared as if it had&#xD;
been modelled in light.&#xD;
Rosemary was too humble to believe that all that beauty&#xD;
&#xD;
LETTERS ANn LOVE-SCENES.&#xD;
&#xD;
458&#xD;
&#xD;
and divine expression were caught from herself. Indeed,&#xD;
O'Morra instructed her that there was a supernatural, a divine&#xD;
ideal in every human face and form, which it was the office of&#xD;
the true inspired artist to detect, to isolate and to represent in&#xD;
its simple p 'rity.&#xD;
"Man was made in the image and likeness of God," said&#xD;
Rory, in his quiet way, which Rose found so fascinating.&#xD;
" In ?" interrupted Rosemary. "I have always been taught&#xD;
to say 'to the image of God."&#xD;
"If you prefer, I will carry on the conversation in Latin,&#xD;
Miss Rose-it is the same to me."&#xD;
"Pardon me, Mr. Rory, I shall not understand a word."&#xD;
"Why don't you say 'I will not understand,' Miss Rose ?"&#xD;
"It is not English," said Rosemary, "since I would under.&#xD;
stand if I could."&#xD;
"Neither is 'to the image' English ; and when I speak my&#xD;
native tongue at all, I do not use a barbarous dialect, though&#xD;
found in Catholic bibles and prayer-books," said O'Morra, with&#xD;
a dash of the paternal smile.&#xD;
"I interrupted you, Mr. Rory."&#xD;
"Man was made IN the image and likeness of God," re-&#xD;
sumed Rory, with emphasis. "And that image extends to the&#xD;
body, no doubt. Not that the Godhead is corporeal, but that&#xD;
the body is made capable of expressing divine things; for&#xD;
example, the supreme dominion of the Creator over the crea-&#xD;
tures. So long as this beautiful sovereignty was expressed in&#xD;
the body of man, so long we read that its dignity was perfect.&#xD;
The sovereignty was lost, and the dignity was debased. The&#xD;
office of the new creation in respect to the body, is to restore&#xD;
that dignity; and of Christian art to represent its restoration."&#xD;
"A beautiful theory, Mr. Rory," said Rosemary, blushing,&#xD;
"but difficult to put in practice, it seems to me, while we&#xD;
remain as we are, with our bodies unredeemed."&#xD;
"Certainly, every breath we draw-hunger-thirst-sleep--&#xD;
pain--teach us that the flesh is not subject to the spirit: yet&#xD;
for all that, there is a way by which the spirit cantriumph&#xD;
utterly over the flesh--n'cst ce pas 1"&#xD;
"I should be an infidel to deny it," said Rose.&#xD;

&#xD;
" If that" triumph exists, it may be represented. Did I not&#xD;
think so, I say again, I would abandon my art. Why, even&#xD;
the Greeks, the masters of sculpture, understood that. What&#xD;
were the statues of the gods but the attempt to restore the&#xD;
half obliterated outlines of the divine image in the human form ?&#xD;
In painting we Christians have succeeded in doing it. The&#xD;
race of Christian sculpture is yet to run."&#xD;
It was a hard thing for Rosemary that she saw the young&#xD;
sculptor only in the act, as it were, of inspiration, in the&#xD;
moment of his power. His hours of weakness, his lassitude,&#xD;
his discouragements, and his combats, she did not witness.&#xD;
She often came to him very weak in purpose, and contgry to&#xD;
what usually happens in such interviews,left him strengthened.&#xD;
As it is not only rare, but almost contra naturam that two young&#xD;
people of different sexes in unwitnessed conversation should&#xD;
fortify each other in virtue, we must suppose that obedience&#xD;
has a mysterious efficacy to change bitter waters into sweet.&#xD;
Rose wondered at that calm, unconscious strength of so young&#xD;
a man, violently susceptible in imagination, passionless in.&#xD;
heart, with so absolute a mastery over his senses, gentle as a&#xD;
woman, severe as a saint, chivalrous as a Cavalier towards her,&#xD;
and rigid as a Puritan with himself. She little imagined that&#xD;
when alone Rory found himself most deplorably weak, and was&#xD;
compelled to sustain the most violent conflicts. He often gave&#xD;
himself up for lost, and was ready to abandon his work as the&#xD;
most presumptuous thought that ever entered a hunian brain ;&#xD;
but, at what cost we have barely hinted, when the hour came,&#xD;
and Rose Dashon presented herself, with all her dazzling&#xD;
charms, his spirit rose at once to the occasion, every film of&#xD;
earth-born passion fell from his eyes, and she was only his&#xD;
muse, his model, and his inspiration.&#xD;
The sittings were not fatiguing, because O'Morra's method&#xD;
was to interest Rosemary to leave her at full liberty, and to&#xD;
catch her unconscious expression and attitudes. It was rather&#xD;
the study of her soul, beaming through her -form, draped with&#xD;
such simplicity that every grace was outlined, than a real&#xD;
posing. At last, he drew her to her own history, thinking that&#xD;
to make her live her life over must draw out the deepest senti-&#xD;
&#xD;
ment of which she was capable. Rose expanded on the subject&#xD;
of her parents, her mother's tragic story, which she narrated&#xD;
with touching pathos and the most innocent directness : then&#xD;
she described grandpapa Romarin, their cottage, her goat,&#xD;
Louise, her early education, her being taken to her grand-&#xD;
parents Dashon, their splendor, the kindness of the Athertons,&#xD;
her school-days, Professor Calcul, in fine, everything but what&#xD;
preceded her intended marriage. All that, with a tact and deli-&#xD;
cacy of which girlhood alone is capable, she avoided. It was&#xD;
a very successful day : O'Morra caught and transferred to the&#xD;
clay certain human traits, a tenderness, a filial ardor, which&#xD;
lie had felt to be wanting. Yet there was one expression,&#xD;
necessary to complete his idea, and deprived of which his work&#xD;
did not satisfy him. He knew not how to give it. He knew-&#xD;
he was sure he knew-how to elicit it on that mobile mask of&#xD;
feeling, but it cost him a great deal to make the experiment.&#xD;
Nevertheless lie resolved to do it.&#xD;
The next day of sitting, he said to her with a tranquil smile-&#xD;
"You have not told me, Miss Dashon, how you came to die."&#xD;
"That is so nearly connected with another thing," said Rose-.&#xD;
"how I came to be married."&#xD;
"You were not married," said Rory, hastily.&#xD;
"Neither did I die," said Rosemary. "If you really wish it,&#xD;
Mr. Rory, I will tell you both how I was at the point of&#xD;
marriage, and as nearly died, and how by means of one I&#xD;
escaped the other."&#xD;
This narrative was not interrupted by the listener. Rose-&#xD;
mary carried it on in the most natural manner, not without a&#xD;
deep color and much emotion, to Col. de Flordal's arrival, her&#xD;
acceptance, her retreat, and how at the moment when, before&#xD;
taking so great a step, she knelt to commend herself to God,&#xD;
and ask one more counsel, lest it should be a great and fatal&#xD;
error, she felt herself sink, utterly powerless, yet conscious&#xD;
not wholly deprived of sensibility, and with all her perceptions,&#xD;
as it were, rendered more acute.&#xD;
"I even saw everything till my eyes were closed by Mrs.&#xD;
Atherton. To the last moment I continued to hear all that&#xD;
passed in my room, and even in those adjoining. There were&#xD;

&#xD;
strange scenes, I assure you. My bridegroom entered, and I&#xD;
heard his voice : it was a declaration of love and' pledge of&#xD;
future marriage to my bridesmaid, weeping by my side--"&#xD;
O'Morra had stopped work-he muttered something inartic-&#xD;
ulate-and stood gazing at her like a man bereft of all senses&#xD;
but sight and hearing.&#xD;
" I had a greater horror when it was proposed to examine&#xD;
my body, to ascertain the cause of my death. Had they&#xD;
agreed to plunge a knife into my heart to make it sure, it&#xD;
would have been nothing, you conceive: but dear grand-&#xD;
mamma! how brave she was then! she defended me," said&#xD;
Rose, with emotion. " I thought I had never loved her before.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin, though I believe him one of the guilty, nor do&#xD;
I yet know his purpose, also- opposed the proposition of the&#xD;
rest. That peril past, in which I counted the certainty of&#xD;
death nothing; came the funeral. I cannot relate these things,&#xD;
Mr. Rory: they are too terrible."&#xD;
"And you preserve your fidelity to the spouse who so&#xD;
shamefully violated his to you !" said Rory O'Morra, immov-&#xD;
able as a statue, and looking at her from under his bent brows&#xD;
with a gaze as piercing as his father's.&#xD;
"I have required him to return my troth-I could scarcely&#xD;
do less and respect myself," said Rosemary.&#xD;
"If he refuse ?"&#xD;
"The cloister."&#xD;
"A needless sacrifice for so poor a creature-pardon me for&#xD;
speaking so of your affianced husband."&#xD;
Rosemary held out both her lovely hands-ringless.&#xD;
"As my hands, so my heart, Mr. Rory. What else has he&#xD;
had of mine, but my promise alone ? Shall it be said that&#xD;
Rosemary Dashon gave her affianced neither her love (for she&#xD;
owed it not); nor a privilege so trifling that one grants it to&#xD;
strangers almost, that of touching her hand in friendship ;&#xD;
much less anything more sacred (though our customs sanction,&#xD;
that too); but her bare mere word of honor, and that she was&#xD;
not faithful to that till it was released i'&#xD;
Rory O'Morra, pale as death, turned to the statue, without a&#xD;
word in reply. Rose knew his habits now so well, that she&#xD;
&#xD;
fearlessly, though anxiously gazed at him, watching those&#xD;
wondrous fingers plunge again almost rudely into the clay,&#xD;
Two hours passed in profound silence. lie took no more notice&#xD;
of her than if she had been a lay-figure sitting there beside him.&#xD;
By slow degrees the new and crowning glory came out upon&#xD;
that mysterious form and face, as if created again from the&#xD;
primitive slime. Rose saw what it meant--for she had gained&#xD;
in these sittings almost a new sense :-there was a strange lofti-&#xD;
ness there, in the midst of the passionate ardors-a pride&#xD;
almost-the Fidelity of the Bride!--" Yes," it said, "I have.&#xD;
been faithful unto death !"-Rosemary, with great humility,&#xD;
hid her own face in her hands.-" Alas !" she said to herself,&#xD;
" it is not I who have been faithful !"&#xD;
At the ringing of O'Morra's alarm Rosemary punctually&#xD;
withdrew to the anteroom, and by the time Mr. Rory had&#xD;
secured his work and purified his hands, her simple toilet was&#xD;
completed, and she departed, accompanied by O'Morra to&#xD;
the street door. That day he detained her. In the first place,&#xD;
the great difficulty of his work was surmounted ; in fact, instead&#xD;
of his having covered it as usual with the indispensable wet&#xD;
cloths, when she re-entered he was gazing at it in silent rap-&#xD;
ture. Nothing now remained but the patient execution of the&#xD;
details, in which he informed her he should seldom, if ever,&#xD;
require her kind aid, until the figure was ready for the drapery,&#xD;
which would be in about three months.&#xD;
"We shall scarcely meet in that time, Rosemary," he said,&#xD;
beginning to cover the lovely and almost living clay.&#xD;
"Shall we not see more of you at home, then ?" she answered,&#xD;
affectionately. " It is very lonely there, I assure you. Every.&#xD;
body, almost, is gone or going ; and that poor Miss Graves&#xD;
dying for you, Rory !"-With a gay laugh and vivid blush.&#xD;
"When you shall have heard from Col. de Floreal," replied&#xD;
O'Morra, in a quiet tone, "I shall be more at home."&#xD;
" And I perhaps shall not," answered the girl in a very low&#xD;
voice--so low that it scarcely seemed she ias speaking to him.&#xD;
"Can his refusal to surrender what he has no earthly title to&#xD;
retain,impart to you.a religious vocation ?" asked O'Morra, in&#xD;
a dry,. matter-offact voice, and turning to her with a smile&#xD;

&#xD;
that was more like his father's than anything Rose had ever&#xD;
observed in him.&#xD;
"I suppose not," Rosemary answered with gentleness.&#xD;
"Yet I suppose, too, that my will is free to render to Heaven&#xD;
the sacrifice not of my virginity alone, which I never for a&#xD;
moment have ceased to desire with all the fervor of, my soul,&#xD;
but of my dearest and purest earthly affections."&#xD;
"EWill you force me, then, to wish that Floreal may be so&#xD;
base and cruel ?" said O'Morra, almost fiercely. "Know, how-&#xD;
ever, Rosemary, that if you are an angel, I am only human ;&#xD;
the victory which innocence and grace render so easy to you,&#xD;
will cost me my life."-And she saw a bright red spot that&#xD;
glowed like fire on either cheek.&#xD;
" This is useless and dangerous," said Rosemary, holding out&#xD;
her hand in farewell.&#xD;
O'Morra coughed slightly and turned away; she saw that as&#xD;
he took away his handkerchief from his lips, it was covered&#xD;
with blood.&#xD;
"Oh, Rory !" she exclaimed.&#xD;
"This is nothing at all,"-coughing again-a fresh stream&#xD;
from the lips-he went into the anteroom, followed by Rose,&#xD;
and lay down on the lounge: she ran to the window that looked&#xD;
down into the great studio, and called Carlo, who sprang at the&#xD;
first word.&#xD;
" Ah, signorina, I expected this !" said the workman, sorrow-&#xD;
fully. "He will die for you at last !"&#xD;
"Run for a doctor," said Miss Dashon.&#xD;
"No !" whispered O'Morra, energetically. "I know what is&#xD;
necessary." .&#xD;
These few words excited another cough, and its alarming&#xD;
concomitant; Rosemary's handkerchief, which she had given&#xD;
him in place of his own, was instantly saturated. But Carlo&#xD;
had already brought some tincture of aconite from the oaken&#xD;
. cabinet, and then a vial containing a powerful styptic, which&#xD;
Rose dropped in water and gave O'Morra a spoonful-- a&#xD;
woman does all that by instinct. She forgot everything in the&#xD;
danger of her friend. Carlo went down stairs to break some&#xD;
ice intimorsels. Evidently, this was not a first attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
As soon as the workman was gone, Rosemary bent down with&#xD;
a lovely, cheerful smile and said-" Rory O'Morra, you have&#xD;
been very wicked not to tell me this before. Now don't&#xD;
talk."&#xD;
You pity me-kind !" whispered the young sculptor, with&#xD;
a flashing eye, in spite of his perilous condition.&#xD;
"I do not pity you-I love you," said Rosemary, simply.&#xD;
" So say no more."&#xD;
This was not very apt to assist the action of the aconite in&#xD;
depressing the circulation, yet it produced apparently no&#xD;
harmful effect. On the contrary, Rory O'Morra coughed no&#xD;
more, and after half an hour.of perfect quiet, during which&#xD;
Rose fed him with morsels of ice, as composedly as if she had&#xD;
always done that, he fell, asleep. Then she went aside, and in&#xD;
whispers questioned Carlo.&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra had been twice attacked in that way, he said;&#xD;
his master persisted that it was only excess of blood, and con-&#xD;
tinued his abstinences and exercise the same as ever. Carlo&#xD;
believed that the young maestro was mad from love of the&#xD;
signorina, who was plighted to another, he knew, but che fare?&#xD;
Was sucha man to die for a pazzo ingrato z"-" Hush, Carlo,"&#xD;
said Rosemary, "you know nothing about it, amico mio ".-.&#xD;
Carlo comforted her greatly by the assurance that immediately&#xD;
after one of these attacks, so frightful to witness, his master&#xD;
was always better for a week or two. He had known him ride&#xD;
on horseback the very next day.&#xD;
As Carlo felt sure that the present attack was over, and was&#xD;
anxious that his master should not find her there when he&#xD;
awoke, Rose reluctantly departed, resolved, nevertheless, not&#xD;
to keep so alarming a secret to herself, but to tell his father&#xD;
that very evening. While she was dressing for dinner, a note&#xD;
was brought her from Mr. Rory ; and the boy (said the maid)&#xD;
was waiting for an answer.&#xD;
"Saturday Evening.&#xD;

not to breathe a syllable of what has occurred to any one,&#xD;
least of all to my father. It would do no good ;.for I will&#xD;
neither explain my course nor change it.&#xD;
"With unreserved devotion,&#xD;
" Roax O'MoRRA.&#xD;
"Miss RosE MARIE DAsHoN."&#xD;
Rosemary wrote in reply:--&#xD;
"Saturday Eve.&#xD;
"DEAR RoRYT:&#xD;
"I shall obey you, though'my&#xD;
conscience tells me that I ought not.&#xD;
"Faithfully yours,&#xD;
"ROSE MARIE."&#xD;
It was Rose's intention (let what would be thought of it) to&#xD;
call at the studio the pext morning and inquire how Rory was,&#xD;
as she understood from Carlo !that he would spend the night&#xD;
there. To her infinite astonishment Rory was at church at six,&#xD;
and waked home with her. He breakfasted with the family,&#xD;
and was remarkably cheerful, though silent. On the wvay&#xD;
home, he had condescended to her entreaties by n)t once&#xD;
opening his lips, except to say that he was "perfectly well."&#xD;
After breakfast, she saw no more of him till dinner: for a&#xD;
wonder he dined at home.&#xD;
On Sunday afternoons Mr. O'Morra (papa) always took a&#xD;
-     drive, but he had never invited "Miss Mari," because he used&#xD;
that opportunity to visit his villa, to spend the, night ; and Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra had no housekeeper. That Sunday afternoon, not&#xD;
expecting to go out, Rosemary was making believe take a&#xD;
siesta, which meant a wrapper, a book and seclusion,when Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra knocked at her door and proposed a ride in the dog-&#xD;
cart. She came to the door, her book in hand, that lie mi ht&#xD;
see she was occupied-it was the Lives of the Sculptors in&#xD;
Italln, and she was absorbed in the glorious existence of&#xD;
Michael Angelo.     -&#xD;
"It is Sunday, you know, sir."-In truth, she had no mind&#xD;
to be interrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What a pretty Puritan it is ! Better day, better deed !"&#xD;
" You always go to your villa, don't you, sir'?"&#xD;
" Andinvite you to accompany me."&#xD;
" Do you return to-night, sir ?"&#xD;
" No ; but Mrs. Grace is there, housekeeping for me."&#xD;
" Mrs. Grace ! Then you expect me to stay all night ?"&#xD;
" Of course."&#xD;
" I shall be delighted, sir; but you must wait till I can dress&#xD;
and put up a little parcel."&#xD;
"'Tis not yet five ; and half an hour hence, or even forty-five&#xD;
minutes (if you require so much), will be full early to start.&#xD;
And Miss Rose ! don't confine yourself to a little parcel; take&#xD;
a good-sized valise (it will go in the dog-cart), and put up&#xD;
dresses enough to last you a week."&#xD;
Rosemary looked blank ; then she remembered that Mr.&#xD;
Rory (if Carlo spoke true) was sure to be better for a week or&#xD;
two, and she consented.&#xD;
After riding about an hour, the horse getting heated, Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra drew up in a place where the road was bordered with&#xD;
trees, and took out a letter.&#xD;
' Now, Miss Rose, while we cool off in this fine shade, read&#xD;
that letter from foreign parts, which reached me this afternoon&#xD;
under cover from the Hon. Mr. Atherton, whom perhaps you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
Rosemary uttered a faint exclamation 'and took the letter,&#xD;
which, free from all postmarks, was addressed in her grand-&#xD;
father Romarin's hand to " Mlle. Rose Marie Dashon."  She&#xD;
immediately remembered that she had forgotten to send her&#xD;
grandfather her address. Mr. O'Morra jumped out of the cart&#xD;
to leave his companion more at liberty, and she broke open the&#xD;
letter.&#xD;
&#xD;

scrupulosity: for if you are justified in requiring a release&#xD;
from your engagement to your cousin in terms so absolute,&#xD;
you would be justified in breaking it. Assuredly there is no&#xD;
such dreadful alternative before you as a convent or a thousand&#xD;
deaths. I take it on myself to annul your engagement. So far&#xD;
from wishing to sacrifice your happiness to ambition, I consent&#xD;
beforehand, my Rose, to any marriage you may form, no mat-&#xD;
ter what the birth or fortune or nationality of your intended&#xD;
husband may be, provided he be personally worthy of you. I&#xD;
'am confident that you will never make an ignoble choice.&#xD;
"Yet consult your grandmother. Should she object upon&#xD;
any grounds but those avowedly of ambition alone, let her objec-&#xD;
tions decide you. Do not marry without her willing consent.&#xD;
Preserve that priceless treasure of your heart and person for&#xD;
one whose merit all will be forced to acknowledge.-A Russian&#xD;

" RoMArn.",&#xD;
There was a postscript.&#xD;
"WE have driven back the Russians with heavy loss : a few&#xD;
serious casualties on our side. I enclose a slip from Col. de&#xD;
Florall"&#xD;
With a sudden sinking of heart, turning away from Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra, who never once looked at her, Rose Marie ,Dashon&#xD;
opened the note from her cousin. It was an absolute release,&#xD;
signed by Flordal, and attested by Romarin. Beneath-&#xD;
"MADEMOISELLE, MY COUSIN :&#xD;
"Pardon. I shall pardon myself never.&#xD;
"FLOREAL."&#xD;
These brief words produced a shower of tears. Mr. O'Morra&#xD;
silently jumped up beside her, touched his horse and away&#xD;
they went. How did Mr. Atherton know what to do with that&#xD;
letter ? .&#xD;
"You imagine yourself concealed, my dear child," said&#xD;
Cabal O'Morra,;"when fifty pair of eyes are upon you. Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Atherton received your grandfather's litter yesterday and sent&#xD;
it to me to-day. By the by, he desires me to inform you, Miss&#xD;
Dashon, that your rents and dividends for six months (some&#xD;
$20,000) are in his hands and subject to your draft."&#xD;
"What else ?" asked Rose.&#xD;
" He thinks that your present position is not sufficiently&#xD;
secluded, and so do I. I propose that you shall remain at my&#xD;
country-house. How will you like that i Your fortune, and&#xD;
the lives of your grandparents may depend on it."&#xD;
Rose was entirely willing, but trusted that if there were the&#xD;
slightest sign of danger to grandpapa or grandmamma, Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra would not forget her injunction to arrest those&#xD;
wretches for what they had already done.&#xD;
" Of which we have no proof, Miss Dashon," said Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra, who treated Rosemary with extraordinary respect.&#xD;
"They have been steadily watched night and day, as you also&#xD;
have been, since the day you thought fit to confide in me.&#xD;
They must be suffered to proceed till tl, evidence is in our&#xD;
hands. Your grandmother is safe. At'least whatever danger&#xD;
she incurs, it is with her eyes open. Wonderful old lady !"&#xD;
" Grandmamma knows all, then, sir ?" asked Rose, with per-&#xD;
fect tranquillity.&#xD;
"Of course. Gracious Heaven ! what a scene was that when&#xD;
I told her plainly the truth. She did not relish it, in spite of&#xD;
her joy and the fever of her re-awakened ambition !" said&#xD;
O'Morra, smiling bitterly.&#xD;
" Grandmamma is very proud, but she loves me," said Rose..&#xD;
mary.&#xD;
"She does not like the idea of your marrying a certain&#xD;
young gentleman of Irish descent, and a very harum-scarum&#xD;
sort of profession," said papa, with a piercing look. Her first&#xD;
words almost were-' You know, sir, that my granddaughter&#xD;
is espoused to her cousin, the Colonel Marquis de Flordal.'-To&#xD;
confess the truth, Miss Dashon, one motive I have in taking&#xD;
you to my villa, is to get you out of the way of my son-nay, don't&#xD;
flush up so angrily-it is a motu proprio-your grandmother&#xD;
has neither asked nor counselled it."&#xD;

there ?" asked Rose. " Very well, sir, I shall go down to&#xD;
Brooklyn to-morrow and let him know, if I have to walk."&#xD;
This was said with a sparkling glance of indignant resolu-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"I won't put you to such an extreme necessity, made-&#xD;
moiselle-you will not be a prisoner in my house, and if you&#xD;
wish to leave it, a carriage and horses will be always at your&#xD;
command," said papa O'Morra.&#xD;
"Do you object to my marrying your son ?" asked Rose,&#xD;
plainly.&#xD;
"Has it come to that V" said O'Morra, with a look of violent&#xD;
surprise.:&#xD;
"No, sir," repliRosemary, smiling in spite of her vexation,&#xD;
"but if you wish to prevent it, now is the time to speak."&#xD;
"Most seriously, beautiful and excellent Rosemary, it would&#xD;
grieve me that such a thing happened while you were our&#xD;
guest, separated from your family. For the world I would not&#xD;
have it said that either Cabal O'Morra or his son used such an&#xD;
opportunity to inveigle an heiress into a match, which after all&#xD;
will disappoint the legitimate ambition of her friends. Now&#xD;
we understand each other."&#xD;
"Tell me, sir," said Rose, "how long ago did you tell grand-&#xD;
mamma that I was alive and under your protection ?"&#xD;
O'Morra took out his tablets-" Three weeks ago."&#xD;
"Four weeks ago, she herself gave me to Rory, sir., Grand-&#xD;
mamma has no right to go back after three weeks' silence ; she&#xD;
will not: if then, you think fit, sir-all I have to say is that it&#xD;
is very cruel to me, who have compromised myself unhesi-&#xD;
tatingly at her bidding. I certainly never expected to be&#xD;
refused."&#xD;
"I had not the most remote idea of this," said Cahal&#xD;
O'Morra.&#xD;
"I have no more to say," said Rosemary. "I shall shut&#xD;
myself up at your villa as long and as strictly as you please. I&#xD;
only hope you will have the goodness to command Mr. Rory to&#xD;
stay'away, for if he come down and ask me to run away with&#xD;
him, I will not answer for myself."&#xD;
"You are all alike," said papa O'Morra, with his bitter smile.&#xD;
&#xD;
"If your grandmother has consented, child, I have no objection,&#xD;
of course."&#xD;
They came to a rustic gate ; a long avenue of fine old trees&#xD;
led on between fields rich with crops, meadows like emerald,&#xD;
and glimpses of wood and waters, until the avenue expanded&#xD;
into a park-like demesne, with lawns sweeping down to a tide-&#xD;
water. Before them, on a gentle eminence, was the house.&#xD;
The dog-cart flashed along the circuit of the lawn, passed&#xD;
round the house and drew up at the sea-front. It was sunset ;&#xD;
the tea-table set (they saw in passingthe windows); and 1o!&#xD;
Rory O'Morra pacing the verandah ! ie started, blushed, and&#xD;
came forward to welcome his father's guest, and help her down&#xD;
from the dog-cart. Rosemary laughed, and sprang lightly&#xD;
down in her gay manner, hardly touching the young man's&#xD;
transparent and emaciated hand ; when-after a moment's&#xD;
hesitation and a shy glance at the papa, she offered her cheek,&#xD;
and then with the prettiest movement possible, in the French&#xD;
manner, turned the other to his salute.&#xD;
The house was of stone, of a reasonable size for a small, hos-&#xD;
pitable family. The rooms were large, the hall wide ; so was&#xD;
the verandah, fragrant with honeysuckle ; and hence you com-&#xD;
manded a white beach, a promontory crowned with firs and the&#xD;
tossing Atlantic. The place was lonely, not another dwelling&#xD;
in sight; but far away to the eastward, at the extremity. of a&#xD;
low point, a light-house whose cheerful beacon already&#xD;
sparkled in the twilight.&#xD;
After tea, or rather supper, they all walked down to the&#xD;
beach. A million fire-flies sparkled on the vast lawn',lighting&#xD;
up the shady depths under the trees ; some tall Lombardy&#xD;
poplars shook their heads in the breeze ; there was a gravelled&#xD;
walk, and a moon just past the full, that threw the shadows&#xD;
across it. The elder couple (papa and Mrs. Grace) walked&#xD;
fast and talked loud. The yomiger pair dragged along as if&#xD;
they had the weight of fourscore to carry, and sometimes&#xD;
stopped, doubtless from fatigue. They did not converse in&#xD;
whispers, yet certainly no one could overhear them; for which&#xD;
reason I cannot tell, though I can guess, what they said.&#xD;
When they reached the house again, a horse covered with&#xD;

foam stood before the door. The rider brought Mr. O'Morra&#xD;
a note. He took it to the light, read it hastily, and said to&#xD;
Rosemary, who had followed him:&#xD;
" Miss Dashon, your grandmother is at home dangerously&#xD;
ill, and Mrs. George Varick has gone over to the house to&#xD;
take care of her."                                                                                CHAPE      XI&#xD;
A NIGHT DRIVE.&#xD;
"THIS morning," said Mr. O'Morra, "Mrs. Dashon was&#xD;
her villa near Fort Hamilton, and Mrs. Varick was at Ro&#xD;
away."&#xD;
The messenger had received the note for Mr. O'Morra&#xD;
New York at half-past five. By five, therefore, Mrs. Dash&#xD;
must have been at her town house. It seemed likely that&#xD;
hat been taken ill during their usul afternoon drive to Gre&#xD;
wood, and that she had proceeded to the city immediately&#xD;
consult Dr. Mannikin, who, it had been agreed;was to be&#xD;
once summoned in such a case. How, then, was Mrs. Var&#xD;
on hand? Was it a calculation based on the fact that&#xD;
Mannikin visited the Dashons daily, Sundays excepted &#xD;
was it a mere coincidence ? If so, it was an unfortunate o&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra was convinced that Madam Isabel had at l&#xD;
made a coup, and he saw the necessity of interfering imr&#xD;
diately, even if he should be obliged to procure her arr&#xD;
No time was to be lost.&#xD;
" The most expeditious way, Rory, will be for you to ta&#xD;
me into Brooklyn in your trotting-wagon."&#xD;
" I have already ordered it round, as well as the dog-cart&#xD;
" We don't need both," said his father.&#xD;
" Let te suggest a better plan," said Rosemary. " Dr&#xD;
Mr. Rory's wagon yourself, Mr. OMorra, and take me. R&#xD;
is not in a fit condition for a night drive of twelve or thirty&#xD;
miles."&#xD;
"Why, what ails Rory ?" asked his father, turning share&#xD;
round.&#xD;
" Nothing to prevent my driving," said the youth. " I&#xD;

&#xD;
peson in the wagon: my father, Rose, can't do it by this light&#xD;
in less than an hour andforty-five-with safety he cannot. If&#xD;
time is of consequence, I must go in."&#xD;
"The life of Mrs. Dashon and the fortune of Miss Dashon&#xD;
depend perhaps on minutes,' said Mr. O'Morra, who had&#xD;
already put on his overcoat and gloves.&#xD;
"But I must go to grandmamma," said Rose. "If she is&#xD;
sick, my place is at her side; if in danger from a false rela-&#xD;
tive, no one can defend her like myself."&#xD;
"I knew that," said Rory, "which is the reason I ordered&#xD;
round both the drags. I can take Rosemary to her grand-&#xD;
father's door ii one hour and twenty minutes, exclusive of the&#xD;
ferry-if we are fortunate there, in one hour and a half, all&#xD;
told. Getting a warrant and officers will cost you, sir, another&#xD;
hour at least: it may be the difference of life and death ?"&#xD;
"How will she gain admittance when there '?" said Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra, regarding the girl with his piercing look.&#xD;
"Leave that to me, sir !" said Rosemary, flushing up.&#xD;
"And what can you do when admitted ?"&#xD;
"All that courage and innocence can in defending the most&#xD;
precious life against cowardice and guilt," said Rosemary.&#xD;
"But you, Rory ! shall I risk your life to save grandmamma's ?&#xD;
No, that would not be right."&#xD;
"What do you mean ?" said papa. "His life ?"&#xD;
"Psha ! I spit a little blood yesterday, and Rose fancies I&#xD;
am going to die," said Rory, carelessly.&#xD;
"Coughed up a tea-cup-ful of bright arterial blood-I know&#xD;
what it is," said Rose. "He should not have quitted the&#xD;
house for a week. He came down here, he says, for perfect&#xD;
quiet, and this is a pretty beginning. I tried hard to persuade&#xD;
the young gentleman not to walk out this evening, but he as&#xD;
good as told me to hold my tongue !"&#xD;
"I am grieved to hear this, my son," said his father, ap-&#xD;
proaching Rory with a sudden look of anxious tenderness&#xD;
most impressive on that cynical countenance, and taking the&#xD;
young man's wrist.&#xD;
"My father," says Rory, "I have let Rosemary go on, that&#xD;
you may understand her better. Assuredly but for certain&#xD;
&#xD;
kind words of hers yesterday, I should have died. I saw by&#xD;
your look to-night that you thought her forward-don't look&#xD;
so confused, Rose-you have no need-it was the forwardness&#xD;
of the leech or the nurse-sir. I am really far from well, but&#xD;
if I were worse, I would take this drive. My mind is made&#xD;
up. 'A man shall leave father and mother,' you know, sir."&#xD;
" Oh! the obstinacy that quotes Scripture in its defence, is&#xD;
invincible !" said his father, with his bitter smile, and dropping&#xD;
the youth's wrist.&#xD;
And at the same text half-uttered, Rosemary fled.&#xD;
"In a case like this, sir," continued Rory, putting on his&#xD;
riding cloak, "we want two strings to the bow. Rosenlary&#xD;
and I will of course reach the ground first, and our action-&#xD;
hers rather--may render yours unnecessary; if we fail, or are&#xD;
in danger of failure, you will come in with your warrant for&#xD;
Madam Isabel and your power of attorney to take possession&#xD;
of the house---"&#xD;
" Mr. Rory is in the right of it," cried sensible Mrs. Grace.&#xD;
"He would be worse fretting here, with his hands tied, than by&#xD;
driving into Brooklyn. And if that wicked woman that my&#xD;
husband has took up with these years, is going to be brought&#xD;
to justice at last, I want to be on hand too. So, Mr. O'Morra,&#xD;
you shan't want company-I will go with you in the dog-cart."&#xD;
"We are to have two women in the business !" said Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra, with an expression of comic disgust.&#xD;
The sound of wheels and hoofs crushing along the gravel was&#xD;
heard, and all went out on the verandah. At the same instant&#xD;
Rosemary came flying down stairs, bonneted, mantled, and a&#xD;
large thick shawl in her hand.&#xD;
At the foot of the steps stood the trotting-wagon in the moon-&#xD;
light, the lightest four-wheeled fabric that ever followed a&#xD;
roadster; the wheels and frame were red; the mountings of&#xD;
silver ; the dark-brown body seemed suspended in air. Young&#xD;
O'Morra stepped in and extended a hand to Miss Dashon, who,&#xD;
gallantly aided by papa, mounted the light but steady machine.&#xD;
The seat was barely wide enough for two, with a back an inch&#xD;
high, and a spring cushion.&#xD;

" There's nothing at all to hold on by, that I can see," said&#xD;
Rosemary laughing, but with real dismay.&#xD;
"Do you call Rory nothing ?" said his father.&#xD;
"Put your hand under my cape, Rose, and you will find&#xD;
that my cloak is belted round the waist with a leathern strap&#xD;
that will bear any strain you choose to put upon it."&#xD;
" Ah, it is only something to give me a little feeling of secu-&#xD;
rity," said the young lady, very easily finding the aforesaid&#xD;
belt. "I never was driven at such speed as you promise,&#xD;
which I find to be full fifteen miles an hour, Mr. Rory."&#xD;
" Roy y," said his father, "take the studio on your way, and&#xD;
tell Friedrich to harness up the old carriage for me: this horse&#xD;
of mine will be quite spent."&#xD;
"All right, sir. What can I do for you in New York, after&#xD;
disposing of Miss Dashon V"&#xD;
" Impertinence ! Send your horse into Mr. Dashon's stable,&#xD;
and go into the house and take care of yourself," replied his&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"Are you warmly enough clad, Mr. Rory ?" said Miss&#xD;
Dashon, in a clear frank tone. "Oh, the cloak is very well,&#xD;
but white pants ! The most imprudent boy in the world, Mrs.&#xD;
Grace. If you have any regard for my peace of mind, wrap&#xD;
this shawl about you' before we start-I brought it down&#xD;
expressly for you.-No, sir ! I don't need any of it-my skirts&#xD;
are quite sufficient for me. Oh! ;arrange it your own,way !"--&#xD;
laughing.-" There ! Oh, wait one moment, Rory-my valise,&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra !-will you bring it along in the dog-cart ? I shall&#xD;
need it at home. All right. Now, Rory."&#xD;
The young man lifted the reins from the dash-board, and&#xD;
the light vehicle went' forward slowly, Sorella walking, and&#xD;
disappeared behind the corner of the house.&#xD;
"Now, pile in, Mrs. Grace," said Cahal O'Morra, grimly.&#xD;
"Bring down Miss Dashon's valise, some one, instantly. What&#xD;
a girl that is ! Such a lovely armful to fall in love with a mere&#xD;
skeleton ! for poor Rory is no more. I must consult Mannikin&#xD;
for him-or no, perhaps Galenson would be safer."&#xD;
"Get Dr. Galenson for Rory," said Mrs. Grace, sententiously.&#xD;
"I don't think he is seriously ill after all," said his father.&#xD;
&#xD;
"lHe has a constitution of iron, or he could never stand up&#xD;
under such a pulse."&#xD;
"Miss Rose will do more for him-than medicine," said Mrs.&#xD;
Grace.&#xD;
"You think that Rory O'Morra was dying of love ?" asked&#xD;
his father, contemptuously.&#xD;
" Mr. 0 Morra, you know nothing at all about your son,'&#xD;
replied Mrs. Mannikin. "I do know something."&#xD;
"As we get over the ground, tell me-what you know."&#xD;
"Rory warn't dying of love, but of trying not to, under&#xD;
circumstances that made it impossible he shouldn't. I say&#xD;
you don't know your own boy, Cahal O'Morra, and you don't.&#xD;
How many young fellows of his age do you think there are,&#xD;
with fathers as well off as you are, with horses and buggies at&#xD;
command, and more money than they know what to do with,&#xD;
and lots of wild acquaintance, sporting-men and artists and&#xD;
young lawyers and doctors-the doctors are the worst of all!&#xD;
-and yet as innocent this minute as the spotless girl that sits&#xD;
beside him? I used to talk to him about her when she was&#xD;
"No doubt !" half groaned O'Morra.&#xD;
" Says Rory-' Mrs. Grace, she is a bride-what are you&#xD;
talking about ?'-' She'll never marry the gentleman,' says I,&#xD;
'take my word for it.'-' That would make no difference,' says&#xD;
he: 'the heart of the woman I marry must have had no pre-&#xD;
vious lodger. That's the case with mine,' says he, 'and I ex-&#xD;
pect a fair exchange.'-That's the way it is with Rory O'Morra.&#xD;
And wouldn't it be too bad now, if after a young man has lived&#xD;
till near four-and-twenty as pure as a saint, he should be served&#xD;
with a dish that others have fingered ?"&#xD;
"Fie, madam !" said Cahal O'Morra.&#xD;
"They are mostly so, take my word for it," replies Mrs.&#xD;
Grace.&#xD;
"I don't believe it," says the cynical O'Morra, in the spirit&#xD;
of contradiction doubtless.&#xD;
"Well, to give you an instance," says Mrs. Grace, with femi-&#xD;
nine inconsequence. "Now this is a profound secret. What&#xD;
Rory would do to me, if he knew I told you, is frightful to&#xD;

think of. You give me your word of honor never to breathe&#xD;
a syllable'? Very well, then: some six years ago, when Rory&#xD;
was about seventeen (he had quitted his first college), week after&#xD;
week, his linen (which unknown to him I took care of) was&#xD;
stained between the shoulders with blood ! I went to him to&#xD;
know the cause. He was terribly annoyed--didn't know the&#xD;
fact-was dumb-founded when I proved it on him, and at last&#xD;
confessed (for I was resolved to get at the truth) that he was&#xD;
'modelling from the life,' as he called it, and that to 'chasten&#xD;
his senses' he whipped himself every night before going to&#xD;
bed, with a frightful little scourge.-"&#xD;
"The young demon !" said Cahal O'Morra, with a groan.&#xD;
"'What would your father do to you, Rory,' says I, 'if he&#xD;
knew of this ?'-' What can he do that's worse V says the boy,&#xD;
with that imperturbable smile of his that seems to defy all the&#xD;
devils to provoke or move him.-' If he'd a whipped you&#xD;
oftener when you was a boy,' says I (for I was real mad), 'you&#xD;
wouldn't be whippin' yourself now for the fun of it.'-' Mrs.&#xD;
Grace,' says he,' did you ever hear of St. Aloysius ?V- Never,'&#xD;
says I.-' He was page for many years to a lovely queen, and&#xD;
in all that time never once raised his eyes to her face.'-' The&#xD;
more fool he!' said I.-' Yet he did ten times worse to himself&#xD;
than I, whose-profession obliges me to let my senses dwell on&#xD;
the most dangerous objects in the world !'-What could a&#xD;
woman answer'? Your son, Cahal O'Morra, has aheart of&#xD;
flame and a will of iron. If a boy of seventeen would prac-&#xD;
tise such a  erit to vanquish his mere senses, what will&#xD;
he do     twenty-four to guard his heart against a serious&#xD;
passio for the loveliest creature breathing, thrown right in&#xD;
his way, nd whom he looks upon as an engaged woman&#xD;
You may be surprised to see him pale and thin as a ghost, and&#xD;
to hear of his raising blood by the half-pint--I ayn't."&#xD;
"Rory is a good fellow, but wilful," said Mr. O'Morra,&#xD;
gravely. "Had he taken to the law, as I wished him, he&#xD;
would have escaped these fine moral perplexities, which, with&#xD;
a young man of his temperament and- delicacy of conscience,&#xD;
arise from his present exceptional-profesion."&#xD;
"Lawyers, in fact, are usually great saints, without any&#xD;
&#xD;
struggles at all !" said Mrs. Grace. " Pray, did you ever hear&#xD;
how it happened that while every other profession has a celes-&#xD;
tial patron, lawyers have none ?"&#xD;
Unless it be that they are so used to pleading, they can&#xD;
answer for themselves, I never did."&#xD;
"You shall hear. A long time ago, when these things were&#xD;
settled for good an' all, a lawyer in Rome, the Cahal 0 Morra&#xD;
that was then, seeing this deficiency, went to the Pope to com-&#xD;
plain of it. Thereupon the Pope, surprised at the lawyer's&#xD;
piety and willing to reward it, took him into a church all full&#xD;
of fine statues of the saints and angels, and says his Holiness,&#xD;
'You shall be blindfolded, and then go up and kiss the foot&#xD;
of some statue here, and whichsoever image you embrace, he&#xD;
shall be the patron of the lawyers. So the lawyer was blind-&#xD;
fold (very carefully too, for the Pope wouldn't trust him no&#xD;
further than he could see him) and went groping about for a&#xD;
patron-saint. Now amongst the rest there was one represent..&#xD;
ing the Archangel Michael trampling on Satan ; the lawyer&#xD;
went along till he came to this group, and, laying hold of a&#xD;
figure which he took to be St. Lawrence on his gridiron, his&#xD;
eyes were unbandaged, when he found himself embracing the&#xD;
prostrate form of the devil !"&#xD;
" Ha ! ha! a very good story !" said Cahal O'Morra.&#xD;
By the time the trotting-wagon had cleared the gardens,&#xD;
Sorella's hoofs had commenced their regular tattoo on the&#xD;
hard road, and true as the arm of an orchestra-leader her four&#xD;
delicate legs went beating the time. The wagon flew along&#xD;
like a bird, the red spokes of the wheels disappeared in the&#xD;
moonlight, and yet they were everywhere at once in their&#xD;
fiery transparency ; steady and nearly springless rolled the&#xD;
vehicle ; in her feet Rose felt the jar of every pebble, from&#xD;
which the spring cushion otherwise defended her ; at first she&#xD;
had grasped Mr. Rory's belt in mortal fear of being thrown&#xD;
out, but becoming gradually accustomed to the seat and feeling&#xD;
the steadiness of the hard swift motion, her native courage&#xD;
returned and another species of timidity resumed its natural&#xD;
sway.&#xD;

Rosemary," said her companion. "It is a serious mortification&#xD;
ti him that his son should profit as I seem likely to do by the&#xD;
chance which has thrown the heiress of the Dashons upon our&#xD;
protection."&#xD;
" I understand perfectly," said Rose.&#xD;
"It is an honorable feeling, after all. I participate in it to a&#xD;
certain extent."&#xD;
" Suppose," said Rosemary, "that yesterday morning when I&#xD;
name to the studio, I had told you that grandpapa was dead, and&#xD;
that cousin Isabel had produced an old will leaving everything&#xD;
to her, and that some informality had been discovered in the&#xD;
deed of trust by whichr he settled so large a property on me&#xD;
before my intended marriage, and (at the same time, mind)&#xD;
that Col. de Flordal had arrived and finding how matters .stood&#xD;
had resigned his claim to my hand-hQw would you have felt V'&#xD;
"Grieved at your grandpapa's death and your loss of fortune,&#xD;
husband and all at once ! I would have sympathized with you&#xD;
as a true friend."&#xD;
Rosemary laughed incredulously.&#xD;
" Then I should have set myself to work to elicit the true&#xD;
account of your betrothal (as I actually did-you remember ?),&#xD;
and when I had arrived at the delightful fact that Rosemary&#xD;
Dashon, though once so nearly a bride, was in heart, in hand,&#xD;
in her untouched cheek and brow, a maiden still, I should have&#xD;
fallen at her feet-and so forth."&#xD;
"And your father ?"&#xD;
"Would have regretted the loss of your fortune more than&#xD;
I, but the instant he saw you, he would have taken your hand&#xD;
with a warmth you would hardly credit, and have told you not&#xD;
to mind, for Rory had enough for both."&#xD;
"It may happen yet that I shall lose the greater part," said&#xD;
Rosemary, thoughtfully.&#xD;
I hope not."&#xD;
." Then you would like to be rich, Rory ? For my part, I&#xD;
would rather be poor, to have you dependent on your glorious&#xD;
art, and myself "-the voice sinking-" on you."&#xD;
"Extremes meet. Poor as you describe, or rich as your&#xD;
actual lot has made you, is the same thing nearly in my eyes,&#xD;
&#xD;
Rose. It is the middle point-wealth in the sense that my&#xD;
father is wealthy-that I rather dislike and fear."&#xD;
" Why ?"&#xD;
"Because it deprives of the incentive to industry. Who,&#xD;
not pressed forward in the track of fame by severe necessity,&#xD;
would long submit to the frightful sufferings that I have en-&#xD;
dured in modelling this statue, Rose, of you? You will say&#xD;
the case is exceptional; that is partially, true ; but no matter,&#xD;
the labor of creative production is the most painful and ex-&#xD;
hausting in the world ; and as the genius which fits one for it&#xD;
is always accompanied with a vast capacity of enjoying the&#xD;
beautiful already created, we see why-the great artist in pos-&#xD;
sibility, become rich, sinks into the mere dilettante. All&#xD;
experience demonstrates it."&#xD;
"But great riches?". asked Rosemary, smiling. ' "Is not&#xD;
their effect the same ?"&#xD;
"The disposal of great riches is itself a wonderful art, which&#xD;
sew, it seems to me, have ever understood."&#xD;
"Is not the wisest disposition to give it all outright to they&#xD;
poor, and so become poor yourself ?"&#xD;
"That is certain," said the young sculptor, with a radiant&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"If it shall ever be possible, Mr. Rory O'Morra, I will put&#xD;
the sincerity of that reply to the proof," said Rosemary Dashon.&#xD;
The conversation soon turned upon the course they were to&#xD;
take in New York. The enterprise of Rosemary, viewed near&#xD;
at hand, seemed more delicate and even dangerous. It was to&#xD;
be presumed that she would find her grandmother helpless, if.&#xD;
not unconscious; Mrs. Varick in possession;. herself reputed&#xD;
dead. How exercise authority over the servants-strangers,&#xD;
perhaps? How even obtain admission to the house, or to her&#xD;
grandmother's room ? The story of Miss Tankerville proved&#xD;
that Isabel Varick was capable of anything. Rosemary, how-&#xD;
ever, thought her a coward, and told Rory the reasons. Isabel,&#xD;
at one time, was addicted to spiritualism, and had circles at&#xD;
her house; she herself had been, or pretended to be, a medium.&#xD;
Grandmamma ha l said that Isabel believed Miss Atherton to&#xD;
have seen the ghost of Rosemary at the Exhibition; and both&#xD;

&#xD;
Rory and she remembered her shriek the day they passed her&#xD;
n Greenwood. With all her fair and over-luxuriant beauty,&#xD;
Mrs. Varick was subject to hysterics. But it is only in Don&#xD;
Giovanni that the Marble Guest arrives on horseback, knocks&#xD;
at the front door, and is admitted with bravado terror by the&#xD;
hardened criminal. It did not appear that they could count&#xD;
with any certainty on the influence of fright and surprise.&#xD;
Rose thought the best plan would be to get admission by the&#xD;
servants' gate ; Rory that the police might be of service.&#xD;
A little cough of Rory's warned the young lady that conver-&#xD;
sing in the open air, even on a balmy summer night, in a&#xD;
trotting-wagon that was going at a regular speed of a mile in&#xD;
three minutes and thirty seconds, was not the most prudent&#xD;
thing in the world for a young man who had had pulmonary&#xD;
hemorrhage the day previous. She imposed silence, and de-&#xD;
vouring her double anxiety, closed her own lips, while now, at&#xD;
the expiration of a half-hour from the start, the vehicle entered&#xD;
the environs of Brooklyn. Their speed was now arrested b&#xD;
the pavement and the streets; Rory made a straight course for&#xD;
the studio; the wheels glided easily into the track of the city&#xD;
railroad, Sorella again went forward like lightning ; they over'&#xD;
take a car, dash off the track, resume it, -turn off sharp at.&#xD;
Pacific, and lo! Sorella stops of her own accord at the studied&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"I have made five minutes clear on my reckoning, Rose-&#xD;
mary. Now up stairs quick and do what we agreed upon."&#xD;
i The young sculptor opened his door with a night-key ;&#xD;
already before he had done so, the stiff groom came out of the&#xD;
adjacent stable, and approached his 'master, who whispered a&#xD;
brief order. Rory and Rosemary entered the studio together.&#xD;
It was dark as pitch, but Rory found a match instantly, and&#xD;
lighted a coil of cerino ; then they went upstairs together, Rory&#xD;
O'Morra leading the way with the light, which cast a flickering&#xD;
glow over the white casts that lined the walls. Arrived in the&#xD;
anteroom, he lit the wax-candles that, placed in sconces, three&#xD;
on either side, adorned the old mirror. They produced a&#xD;
bright illumination.&#xD;
"pow, Marble Bride !" he said, "I leave you."&#xD;
&#xD;
The sculptor descended into his great studio. For some&#xD;
minutes he paced its brick floor silently, while the coil of&#xD;
cerino burned on a table. Suddenly he took it up and&#xD;
approached his own bust of the " Marble Bride." The original&#xD;
was at Mrs. Dashon's, having been sent there after the Exhi-&#xD;
bition, in acknowledgment of the gift of Arab.  As the&#xD;
light of the waxen coil fell on the marble features and&#xD;
bosom, there was a spectral, almost preternatural effect which&#xD;
Rory had never before seen, and at which even he started. A&#xD;
derisive smile played on the marble lips. It would have awed&#xD;
a person at all superstitious. O'Morra was trying the effect of&#xD;
holding the light in various positions when the door on the&#xD;
stair opened and Rosemary appeared.&#xD;
She came down daintily, holding her skirts with care. In&#xD;
the gloom of that vast studio, in which the single flame of the&#xD;
cerino served but to render the darkness visible, that white&#xD;
and shining vision had something weird and ghost-like in it.&#xD;
W ithout a word Rory O'Morra preceded her to the street-door,&#xD;
where a carriage, such as is always kept ready in livery&#xD;
stables to attend a party, or the opera, was in waiting in lieu&#xD;
of the trotting-wagon. Miss Dashon took the back seat Mr.&#xD;
R. O'Morra the front, and the equipage started at a round&#xD;
pace for the ferry.&#xD;
"We have lost twenty minutes by this arrangement," ob-&#xD;
served O'Morra.&#xD;
" They won't be lost, Rory. And you are protected from&#xD;
the night-air."&#xD;
They just missed a bpat. It involved at that hour a delay of&#xD;
twenty minutes. It was just eleven when the next boat&#xD;
started.&#xD;
"It would be mortifying,'' observed O'Morra "if after all&#xD;

separated from the street by a high stone wall. Once I am&#xD;
inside that wall, I engage to get into the house, unless there&#xD;
have been great changes since I died.'&#xD;
" Is it simply a question of getting over a stone wall ?"&#xD;
" The top of the wall is planted with iron spikes, having&#xD;
sharp points in all directions ; the stable wall the same."&#xD;
"On the garden side ?"&#xD;
"All round the garden runs a high iron railing, the top&#xD;
spikes of which are like spears, and nearly four feet long,&#xD;
almost impossible to pass. Besides, there is a night watchman&#xD;
and the regular police always patrolling."&#xD;
"As what we propose is flat burglary, we must take those&#xD;
gentry into account. What is next to the garden?-if I remem-&#xD;
ber, a church."&#xD;
"Could we get into the church the rest would be simple&#xD;
enough, for the vestry has a door that opens directly into our&#xD;
garden. Often on Saturdays when the church was swept and&#xD;
aired for the Sunday, we girls used to run in and out, and play&#xD;
hide-and-go-seek in the vestry."&#xD;
"Who is the sexton-do you know ?"&#xD;
"My childish terror ! Mr. Simon Cameron, the undertaker."&#xD;
"Then our path is plain. Where is Mr. Cameron's shop ?"&#xD;
"No. ---  Broadway. Was it not printed in gold letters on&#xD;
a scutcheon upon the front of the church V" .&#xD;
"We'll take it on our way. The undertakers are open day&#xD;
and night, all days in the week."&#xD;
"They are the poursuivants of my royal friend, King Death.&#xD;
Do you remember the last time we crossed the ferry together,&#xD;
Rory '?"&#xD;
"Your head was in my lap, Rose."_&#xD;
"Not my head, Rory, but that which held my head. I&#xD;
looked up in your face, my brother, and verily thought it&#xD;
was an angel.-How strangely you breathe, Rory ?"&#xD;
"The closeness of this carriage oppresses me. Do you&#xD;
object to letting down another window V'&#xD;
"My dear Rory, there is too much air already I"&#xD;
" I can hardly breathe."&#xD;
"Indeed !" said Rose, gravely.&#xD;
&#xD;
They stopped at the undertaker's. Mr. Simon Cameron&#xD;
kept the key of the church at his house, a mi'e distant.&#xD;
O'Morra took the street and number.-" Drive there.''-Again&#xD;
the carriage dashed off. Rosemary had noticed that although&#xD;
in her hearing;Rory had said nothing on the subject to the&#xD;
driver, the horses were almost on a gallop the whole way.&#xD;
They reached Mr. Simon Cameron's. The night-bell caused a&#xD;
thin, night-capped face to protrude from the second story&#xD;
window.&#xD;
" Mr. Cameron, without stopping to dress yourself, bring&#xD;
down the key of Dr. B-'s church."&#xD;
"The key of the church is in the vestry."&#xD;
"The key of the vestry, then."&#xD;
"Who wants it ?"&#xD;
"Rosemary Dashon," said the girl, standing half outside the&#xD;
carriage, with one satin-clad foot on the step.&#xD;
The old man uttered an exclamation, and drew in his head.&#xD;
He did not come down without dressing, however. Yet in&#xD;
about two minutes he appeared, candle in hand, in a thick&#xD;
gown and slippers and a black velvet cap on his narrow front.&#xD;
"Is it a wedding in the church at this time of night ?P_&#xD;
"It is an extra occasion, I know, Mr. Cameron, and the&#xD;
sexton s fee for opening the church will be accordingly," said&#xD;
0 Morra, extending a $100 bank-note.&#xD;
"I will dress myself and go along with you---."&#xD;
"We can t wait, Mr. Cameron-it is a matter of life and&#xD;
death: minutes are hours. Give us the key at once. Miss&#xD;
Dashon, whom you know, will be responsible for it."&#xD;
"Miss Dashon ! Rosemary Dashon ! She has been dead&#xD;
and buried these six months. Take back your money, sir. I&#xD;
don't know who you are."&#xD;
"Mr. Cameron !" said Rose. "Is it possible you don't know&#xD;
who lam l"&#xD;
The old man nearly dropped the candle.&#xD;
"Gracious Providence !" he exclaimed, in a trembling voice.&#xD;
He came down the steps with his candle and held it up before&#xD;
the bride-like figure. "Good Lord ! oh ! the ways of Provi-&#xD;

deuce ! This is Rosey Dashon! In the same dress she was&#xD;
laid out in ! Mercy be praised! Is it a miracle '!&#xD;
"The key of the vestry, Mr. Cameron. I want to get through&#xD;
into grandpapa's garden."&#xD;
"You shall have it, Miss Rose. Do you know that your&#xD;
grandmother is. dying'? The gardener told me to-night, after&#xD;
evening service, that was the talk of the servants."&#xD;
"The key," said O'Morra, impatiently.&#xD;
The key was brought ; Mr. Cameron had to explain its use ;&#xD;
what door, &amp;amp;c.; and how after they got in, they were to lock&#xD;
up on the inside, and leave the door into Mr. Dashon's garden&#xD;
open. It would be perfectly safe, and the servants would let&#xD;
him through in the morning.&#xD;
"No, keep the money, Mr. Cameron, and remember that we&#xD;
count on your silence-you understand'?&#xD;
"Mum's the word," said the undertaker. "Oh, my ! what a&#xD;
surprise this will be to some people ! Little Rose.--"&#xD;
The horses were off on a gallop again. Rosemary, in her&#xD;
excitement, nearly embraced her companion. O'Morra checked&#xD;
her transport.&#xD;
"I had never a doubt, Rose, that so much as this would be&#xD;
successfully accomplished. It is what remains to be done that&#xD;
gives me anxiety. An ignominious failure, and worse, a fatal&#xD;
one, is still possible."&#xD;
The church clock (belated somewhat) was striking twelve as&#xD;
two figures, male and female, passed out of the vestry door into&#xD;
a fragrant and shrubberied garden. They enter a trellised&#xD;
grapery so thick with vine-leaves that the moonbeams barely&#xD;
sift through. From the other extremity a dog, a huge St.&#xD;
Bernard, rushes towards them with heavy bounds and a fierce&#xD;
growl. The girl sprang forward a step and called---" Thunder !&#xD;
Thunder !"-The bark ceased: the animal advanced cautiously&#xD;
up the arcade. She called again : "Come here, sir ! Lie down,&#xD;
sir !"  The dog sprang towards her frantically-" Keep off,&#xD;
sir ! Put your dirty paws on my dress, if you dare.' -She&#xD;
caught his collar, and shaking her little fist at his enormous&#xD;
shaggy head,-" You rascal, if you don't keep quiet, I'll kill you&#xD;
-do you understand'!"&#xD;
&#xD;
Thunder appeared to understand-that perfectly. He smelled&#xD;
a little aboutO'Morra, and walked along quietly beside them.&#xD;
As they went, a goat uttered from the stable-yard her piteous&#xD;
maternal bleat.&#xD;
' Hear that!' whispered the girl.&#xD;
The south front of the great house was before them, bathed&#xD;
in the moonlight. They crossed an open space quickly and&#xD;
arrived under an arch, through which the moonlight poured&#xD;
into a paved court. They descend into the court. In one corner&#xD;
a winding stair of stone. The girl mounts it, and presently a&#xD;
pears on the terraced roof of the stables, set with great ases&#xD;
of cactus. The young man is below, keeping in the shadow&#xD;
and watching her. That radiant figure, shining like silver in&#xD;
the full moonlight, advances upon the lofty wall. She lifts her&#xD;
glistening skirt and plants her shining foot on the narrow cope.&#xD;
stone ; her veil flows and flutters in the soft night-breeze. The&#xD;
jewels on her breast and arm yield a sombre gleam. There&#xD;
was a moment of unsteadiness, when, being precisely over the&#xD;
centre of the moonlit arch, she looked down at Rory.&#xD;
In another minute she has crossed safely.&#xD;
Rosemary touched the sash of the conservatory-it flew open.&#xD;
It is a single high step, a light spring, and the silver-shining&#xD;
form has entered the house.                      -&#xD;

THE POISONER AND THE GHOST.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE POISONER AND THE GHOST.&#xD;
GRANDMAMMA had tried to wean Mr. Dashon from that&#xD;
melancholy Greenwood drive. Dr. Mannikin and Dr. Galenson&#xD;
(who had been called in consultation) agreed to recommend it.&#xD;
The first experiment was attended with results so unfavorable,&#xD;
not to say alarming, that the physicians changed their opinion,&#xD;
and decided that Mr. Dashon should not be crossed in any-&#xD;
thing. In truth, he adhered to life by his love for the memory&#xD;
of that most exquisite grandchild, sole heiress of his blood,&#xD;
and object of so much tender pride,&#xD;
On the Sunday, July 29th, the full of the moon, after their&#xD;
early dinner, the Dashons went to Greenwood as usual, and the&#xD;
instant they entered the vault, a singular sickness and faint-&#xD;
ness seized the whole party. John, the strong Irish footman,&#xD;
came out white as a sheet, trembling on his brawny pins, and&#xD;
hardly able to sustain Mr. Dashon. Augusta Varickstaggered&#xD;
to the carriage and fainted entirely away on the steps. Grand-&#xD;
mamma held out bravely, using her salts. Mr. Dashon was&#xD;
least affected. Johnson, the coachman, who had not entered&#xD;
the vault, of course escaped. He assisted John in lifting Mr.&#xD;
Dashon and Miss Varick into the carriage. Mrs. Dashon got&#xD;
in unaided, and ordered ,Johnson to drive immediately to the&#xD;
house in lew York, taking Dr. Mannikin' on the way. John-&#xD;
son obeyed orders exactly. Dr. Mannikin was not at home ; a&#xD;
message was left on the slate. By the time they reached the&#xD;
Avenue, John, who sat on the box with. Johnson, drinking in&#xD;
the fresh air, had nearly recovered ; but the party inside the&#xD;
carriage h'ad grown worse and worse. Grandmamma was&#xD;
taken out nearly insensible, Augusta more dead than alive,&#xD;
grandpapa in-a profound comatose slumber.&#xD;
Such was the story which footman John and Johnson the&#xD;
&#xD;
coachman related  to Dr. Edward Varick. Mrs. Varick&#xD;
(chance had brought har up from Rockawayj was sent for&#xD;
of course to look after her daughter, and Mrs. Varick sent&#xD;
immediately for her uncle. Mrs. V. declared that she always&#xD;
knew no good would come of those ridiculous visits to that&#xD;
hateful vault; she wondered aunt Dashon would humor uncle&#xD;
in such a thing: she would not; and as for Augusta, if she got&#xD;
better of this, aunt might say and do what she liked, the child&#xD;
should never go in that carriage to Greenwood again. She&#xD;
would have put a stop to it long ago, had not Augusta&#xD;
herself continually protested that she was perfectly willing.&#xD;
Mrs. Varick's maternal anxiety would scarcely allow uncle&#xD;
doctor to see his sister first. Dr. Varick prescribed active&#xD;
counter-irritation, sinapisms to the feet, slapping of the hands,&#xD;
an emetic, and the administration internally of diffusible sti-&#xD;
mulants. A faint smile stole over the squirrel mouth of his&#xD;
niece at these orders, which she promised should be faithfully&#xD;
complied with. Brandy and ammonia were immediately put&#xD;
in requisition, and Louise was directed to prepare mustard&#xD;
poultices for the feet and ancles of madame. Mrs. Varick did&#xD;
not smile when uncle doctor ordered the same measures for&#xD;
Augusta, whose state he frankly pronounced more alarming&#xD;
than sister Dashon's. He added to her list of remedies smart&#xD;
flagellation. Poor old uncle Dashon was much less affected.&#xD;
Footman John had deposited the old gentleman in his invalid&#xD;
chair near an open window, and although he slumbered pro-&#xD;
foundly, his breathing was already free. Mrs. Varick urged&#xD;
the propriety of doing nothing for uncle till Dr. Mannikin&#xD;
arrived. To this, considering the very great delicacy of bro-.&#xD;
ther Dshon's situation, uncle:doctor assented, and took leave,&#xD;
promising to drop in again in the evening. All this between&#xD;
five and six in the afternoon.&#xD;
Once these events would have caused much confusion in the&#xD;
great house; if not confusion, excitement. Truly now there&#xD;
was no one to be excited. The cook and men-servants were&#xD;
at the hired villa; old Louise and a couple of chambermaids&#xD;
formed, with the gardener, the entire establishment. Yet even&#xD;
these with footman John and coachman Johnson were quite a&#xD;

household. Footman John, generously forgetting his own&#xD;
troubles, was only anxious to be of use to master or madam or&#xD;
Miss Augusta; and Mrs. Varick set him to watch and wait on&#xD;
uncle Dashon. Coachman Johnson put up his horses, locked&#xD;
the carriage-house and stables, and assumed the functions of&#xD;
porter, seating himself in the great hall, and at earliest dusk&#xD;
taking care to light the gas in the halls and on the stair-case&#xD;
from basement to attic. When there is sickness in the house,&#xD;
and there are invalids on the first floor and one (Miss Augusta)&#xD;
on the third, one needs light in the passages. We scarcely&#xD;
need to be reminded that the first floor of Mr. Dashon's house&#xD;
contained the living rooms of the family, with Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon'-s andltosemary's bedrooms, that the second floor&#xD;
(called abroadthe first) was the drawing-room suite, and that&#xD;
the bedroomswere on the third. Miss Augusta was not per-&#xD;
mitted to occupy cousin Rosemary's room, next to grand-.&#xD;
mamma's. That was always a sore spot. Of course the state-&#xD;
bedchamber in the drawing-room suite, destined for Presidents,&#xD;
Bishops, Princes and the daughter of the house on her bridal&#xD;
(if need were), was not for Miss Varick: so Augusta had to&#xD;
mount au troisieme, or, to spe k more exactly when we speak&#xD;
French, au second. When the coach arrived with the sick&#xD;
folk, before. Madam Isabel had been sent for, after Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon had been got safely into their respectiveapart-&#xD;
ments on the ground floor, strong-limbed and willing John&#xD;
carried Miss Augusta in!his arms up to her own room, where&#xD;
one of the maids took the young lady in charge.&#xD;
Thus not a person was unemployed; .no two were together ;&#xD;
the other maid, being something of a cook, was stationed in&#xD;
the kitchen by General Isabel; there was a deal to do there first&#xD;
and last, including the evening meal for all; and the bells were&#xD;
answered and trays carried by obliging Mr. Johnson. In his&#xD;
black livery, small-clothes and stockings (both well filled out),&#xD;
his bald pate, freckled face and light-brown whiskers, he was&#xD;
everywhere at once. But old Andrew Horton, the Scotch gar-&#xD;
dener,-he did nothing but sit on his bench in the kitchen and&#xD;
watch events. When Mrs. Varick came down stairs to prepare&#xD;
with her own hands the poultice for her daughter's delicate&#xD;

feet, wherein she mixed a great deal of flour and very little&#xD;
mustard (it wouldn't have reddened the skin of a baby), she&#xD;
scowled at Andrew severely. Andrew in fact could judge that&#xD;
there was some difference between that mild compost and the&#xD;
fiery sinapisni sent up a little before to torture poor old grand..&#xD;
mamma. As for the emetic and the whipping, Miss Augusta,&#xD;
through her mother's mistaken tenderness, escaped them al-&#xD;
together.&#xD;
Matters were getting quiet again, when the front door bell&#xD;
sounded. That bell-it was a gong of sonorous and musical&#xD;
reverberation-made Madam Isabel nervous. Johnson had&#xD;
orders not to admit any one without ascertaining from a narrow&#xD;
side-light that formed a very ornamental feature in' the exte-&#xD;
rior of the portal, who it was, and if a stranger; his name and&#xD;
business. Presently, Mr. Johnson informed Mrs. Varick that&#xD;
two gentlemen desired to see her.&#xD;
"Two gentlemen!" said the lady, sharply. "You admitted&#xD;
them ? Who are they ?"&#xD;
At a significant look from Johnson, madam followed him&#xD;
into the hall.&#xD;
"It's the two young doctors as I 'ave spoke hof to your lady-&#xD;
ship. They 'ave called at the hother 'ouse, and was naturally&#xD;
directed over 'ere."&#xD;
"Where are they ? In the library-is there any light there '&#xD;
I see you have lit the gas already, Johnson."&#xD;
"It's so huncommon dark in this 'all, ma'am."&#xD;
Mrs. Varick's other anxieties had driven a conditional ap-&#xD;
pointment out of her head; it was to have been on a Sunday&#xD;
afternoon, she remembered. She glanced at her elegant wrap-&#xD;
per in the mirror at the foot of the hall, and swept into the&#xD;
library. She found two very respectable young men, looking&#xD;
like doctors both, and one, by his massive brow, thick black&#xD;
brows, ardent-black eye, and quick shrewd glance, showing a&#xD;
type that interested Madam Isabel's physique. This gentle-&#xD;
man was full-fleshed and vigorous in all his proportions. His&#xD;
companion was slim, narrow-headed, sallow, ugly, yet withal&#xD;
had the air of a Southern gentleman. Madam Isabei -read&#xD;
them both at a glance ; she was too experienced a woman of the&#xD;

&#xD;
world to fail in that. She begged them to be seated-they&#xD;
were gazing with admiration at the beautiful book-cases and&#xD;
other appropriate furnishings of the room.&#xD;
"We have the honor of seeing Mrs. Varick '" said the stout&#xD;
young man, in a foreign accent.&#xD;
"That is my name," said Mrs. Isabel, with a smile.&#xD;
" My name is O'Callaghan-Dr. O'Callaghan at your service-.&#xD;
and this is my friend Dr. Fitzfulke, attached, like myself, to&#xD;
the service of the City Hospital. We understood, madam, that&#xD;
you wished to see us."&#xD;
"It is on a subject deeply painful to me, gentlemen. Mr. John-&#xD;
son will have informed you that I have discovered the violation&#xD;
of the tomb of a young relative of mine. I shall not character-&#xD;
ize his conduct or its motive : the temptation doubtless was&#xD;
strong--"_&#xD;
"Very-for a thief !" said O'Callaghan, with a twinkle under&#xD;
his dark brows.&#xD;
Mr. Johnson, who was listening at the keyhole, clenched his&#xD;
fist at the speaker.&#xD;
*       "In brief, sirs !" said Madam Isabel, abruptly, "he sold&#xD;
you my poor cousin's body ?"&#xD;
"But not the clothes or jewels, ma'am-the body only," said&#xD;
Dr. Fitzfulke.&#xD;
"It is not our business on this occasion, Doctor, to know&#xD;
that there were either clothes or jewels-we ignore such'things&#xD;
in the case," said O'Callaghan, reprovingly.&#xD;
"Neither do I wish to inquire what became of either," said&#xD;
Mrs. Varick. "I am aware, indeed, that they were disposed&#xD;
of by the man Johnson and his confederate-it was the price&#xD;
of their villainy.. But-gentlemen-the body of my unfortu-&#xD;
nate cousin?'"-In a pathetic accent.&#xD;
The young physicians exchanged glances.&#xD;
"You mean to ask, madam, what was done with its--"&#xD;
" Yes,-after-after-  "&#xD;
"After dissection, you would say, madam ?"&#xD;
"That's it !" said Mrs. Varick, covering her face with an ex-&#xD;
pression of horror.&#xD;
"Well, ma'am," said Fitzfulke, to whom O'Callaghan nodded,&#xD;
&#xD;
" we preserved the heart in spirits, and the skeleton, after&#xD;
being treated properly,.was taken for artistic purposes by one&#xD;
of the class."&#xD;
Mrs. Varick drew a long breath, as if greatly relieved. She&#xD;
had gazed at the speaker intently and felt convinced that he&#xD;
was describing facts just as they occurred.&#xD;
"Could the heart and-skeleton-be recovered ?" she asked.&#xD;
"By the family, madam ?" asked O'Callaghan. "With secu-&#xD;
rity that no prosecution would follow-certainly, I suppose so."&#xD;
"But they could not be identified, perhaps."&#xD;
" Undoubtedly they could," said O'Callaghan.&#xD;
"Would you and your friend be willing to swear to their&#xD;
identity in a court of justice ?" asked Mrs. Varick, rather&#xD;
quickly and over-eagerly.&#xD;
" With all the pleasure in life," said O'Callaghan, his thick&#xD;
brows drawing down nore closely than ever over the sparkling&#xD;
orbs beneath, "Wouldn't you, Fitz ?"&#xD;
"I haven't set eyes on the remains since they left our dis-&#xD;
secting table," said Fitzfulke, with admirable coolness, " but&#xD;
I am confident I could take my oath of the identity. God&#xD;
Almighty doesn't turn out such a piece of workmanship as&#xD;
your cousin, every day in the year, madam."&#xD;
" Ah! you know, of course-(that dainty modesty !)"-said.&#xD;
Madam Isabel :-the last words as if involuntarily, and under-&#xD;
breathed, but in a tone so exulting, with so cruel a triumph,&#xD;
that the young men again exchanged glances, and rose.&#xD;
"I believe that this is all you wanted of us, madam," said&#xD;
o Callaghan, folding his great muscular arms on his herculean&#xD;
chest, and regarding the lady with his shrewd and glowing&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"I thank you very much, both of you, gentlemen, for the&#xD;
information. I would ask you to stay longer, but the house is&#xD;
full of sick people, my own daughter in the number---"&#xD;
So the young men, looking at her again, and then at each&#xD;
other, departed.&#xD;
Isabel Varick returned to her aunt's bedside, joyful.and full&#xD;
of confidence.-" These men," said she, "can have no motive&#xD;
to deceive, they are willing to swear to what they say, they can&#xD;

or plunge the knife in her bosom-a--h !"-another shudder.&#xD;

for him that time. Johnson's tale is doubtless true, that he&#xD;
was there waiting on the same night, and being sh t out by acci-&#xD;
dent was furious to get in again, but was obl ged to.retire&#xD;
baffled and enraged! That does me good to think, now I know&#xD;
that all succeeded, not as I wished, but as my interest, my just.&#xD;
rights, wished."&#xD;
That gong once more! With its sonorous long-drawn vi-&#xD;
bration ! Who is at the front-door now ? It is Dr. Ezekiel&#xD;
Mannikin just returned from a visit to Mrs. Geo. Varick herself&#xD;
at Rockaway, where he found her not. Dr. Mannikin, the&#xD;
family physician, is admitted, of course, without parley.&#xD;
" Doctor," says Mrs. Varick, gravely, meeting him in the&#xD;
hall, "you must go in at once and see uncle. Uncle doctor&#xD;
has been here and has prescribed for the others, but I would&#xD;
not allow anything to be done for uncle Dashon till you ar-&#xD;
rived."&#xD;
"Why, what is the matter ?" said Mannikin, turning pale.&#xD;
" Come into uncle's room and I will tell you."&#xD;
When Ezekiel had heard the story, confirmed at everypoint&#xD;
by footman John, in attendance on his master, having felt Mr.&#xD;
Dashon's pulse and timed his respiration, he drew forth a, little&#xD;
vial of red tincture, and let fall a single drop on a lozenge of&#xD;
pure sugar and mucilage, which was easily introduced into the&#xD;
mouth of the still slumbering patient without disturbing him.&#xD;
Then Mannikin asked what Dr. Varick had prescribed for his&#xD;
sister and niece.&#xD;
" Had one of those things-much more all-been attempted&#xD;
with your uncle, madam, he would not have lived through ,the&#xD;
night," said Ezekiel.&#xD;
"Then you don't approve of uncle Edward's treatment."&#xD;
"If persevered in long enough it will kill them both."&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin gave John, who complained bitterly of head-&#xD;

ache and weakness, a dose from the same red vial-a single&#xD;
drop in a wine glass-full of water, and bade him take care&#xD;
that his master's windows were open all night. He went up to&#xD;
Augusta's room-same dose, same orders : perfect quiet for the&#xD;
patient, no teasing, and plenty of fresh air. Then he proposed&#xD;
to see grandmamma, but Mrs. Varick objected.&#xD;
" Doctor, I have more confidence in you than I have in uncle&#xD;
Edward, and I take the responsibility of changing Augusta's&#xD;
treatment on your advice, because it is my own child. It is&#xD;
quite different with aunt. It is her own brother, and should&#xD;
anything unfortunate occur-I hope there will not-but should&#xD;
there-andc you had changed the entire treatment in Dr.&#xD;
Varick's absence-you know the blame would be laid to me as&#xD;
well as to you, and some wouldn't hesitate to say we had con-&#xD;
spired together to kill her."&#xD;
"You are a wonderful woman, Isabel!" was Mannikin's&#xD;
sole reply.&#xD;
"I have - some foresight. If aunt is going to die, which I&#xD;
fear very much, I want the blame to lie on uncle Edward, who&#xD;
is one of the family and directly interested in her living,-not&#xD;
on you."&#xD;
" Let me treat her as I have the rest, and I guarantee her&#xD;
life," replied Mannikin, in a low, emphatic tone.&#xD;
"That's very well for you to say-I have not the same con-&#xD;
fidence in your remedies in her case," replied Mrs. Varick.&#xD;
"You will allow me to see her ?"&#xD;
"Decidedly not-she is under uncle's care-it would be very&#xD;
indelicate !"&#xD;
" Good evening !" said the doctor.&#xD;
And Mr. Johnson opened the front door for Dr. Ezekiel's exit.&#xD;
Grandmamma grew rapidly worse, so much worse that gar-&#xD;
dener Andrew was despatched to hasten the second visit of Dr.&#xD;
Varick. Dr. V. came. He was greatly astonished that Dr.&#xD;
Mannikin had been there and had changed all his prescriptions&#xD;
for Augusta. He was even more vexed that having changed&#xD;
the treatment in one case, he had not been allowed to do it in&#xD;
the other. Then the whole responsibility would have rested&#xD;
where it ought. However, he saw his sister, and found her&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
greatly worse. Another physician (not Mannikin) was sent for&#xD;
in consultation. Grave shakes of the head ! grave putting of&#xD;
two old heads together ! and both of them had more white hair&#xD;
outside than brains within. Some modification of treatment&#xD;
agreed on. More fresh air ordered--Mrs. Dashon's windows to&#xD;
be opened, sinapisms and revulsives remitted for the present,&#xD;
stimulants directed to sustain the patient's evidently failing&#xD;
strength. Consulting physician takes leave, with a very unfa-&#xD;
vorable opinion of the result, plainly intimating to the crest-&#xD;
fallen Varick that he has been sent for too late! Dr. Edward&#xD;
remains about half an hour, during which no change occurs ;&#xD;
then, as it is getting late, past ten o'clock, takes his hat and&#xD;
cane, and promises to call early in the morning. The news&#xD;
percolates the house that it will go hard with old Mrs. Dashon,&#xD;
and the servants already see in Mrs. Varick their future&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
Then Isabel Varick's spirits suddenly flagged; she helped&#xD;
herself out of her medicine chest, and out of the brandy de-&#xD;
canter, and her spirits rose again. Old Louise watched her.&#xD;
If Mrs. Isabel approached the table where Mrs. Dashon's re-&#xD;
medies stood, the bonne's eyes were upon her; if she drew&#xD;
near her bed, the bonne drew near also. There was a strange&#xD;
and silent conflict between those two women. At last Madam&#xD;
Isabel took a vial from her little private chest, and dropped&#xD;
from it into the glass from which her aunt received a spoonful&#xD;
every half hour. Louise rose quietly, took the glass from her&#xD;
hand and flung it out of the window.&#xD;
"What do you mean, woman V'&#xD;
"I not trust you, madame. You kill my Rose-now you&#xD;
shall kill her poor grand'nere, to get the money. You will&#xD;
kill me first-comprenez vous" &#xD;
Mrs. Varick sat down and glared at her silently, devoured&#xD;
with rage.&#xD;
Another source of anxiety. The time was passing swiftly as&#xD;
ever, while mortal purposes lag behind. It was near eleven; she&#xD;
had no reason to expect unwelcome visitors, but many fears;&#xD;
there were some who might wish to enter in her despite. Uncle&#xD;
Dashon's windows looking on the street, were open; there was&#xD;
&#xD;
THE POISONER AND THE GHOST.&#xD;
&#xD;
491&#xD;
&#xD;
the depth of the paved area to prevent an active man spring-&#xD;
ing up, but if armed with a ladder, if the police assisted,that&#xD;
was nothing. So Mrs. Varick made Jchn pull down the patent&#xD;
burglar-proof iron shutters and close the windows; and then,&#xD;
to get him out of the way, sent him to bed. With the doors&#xD;
open straight through, the women could well enough look&#xD;
after Mr. Dashon in the night; if a man were needed, Mr.&#xD;
Johnson was at hand. So Madam had the whole house firmly&#xD;
closed, except on the garden side, where aunt's bedroom win-&#xD;
dows were still open to the air.&#xD;
Crafty Isabel! she was too much at last for the simple bonne.&#xD;
Shem was patient, and watched her opportunity. The neigh-&#xD;
boring church clock struck heavily twelve. Isabel Varick&#xD;
hated church clocks at night ; particularly, striking twelve !&#xD;
She rose and went to the window; the fierce growl of a dog ;-&#xD;
"What dog is that ?"-Mrs. Varick hated dogs.&#xD;
"The St. Bernard pup sent by M. le general to my Rose,"&#xD;
said the bonne.&#xD;
"I'll have him killed to-morrow," said Madam Isabel.&#xD;
"list--he ! what is that 1" said the old bonne in an awful&#xD;
whisper, rushing to the other window, and stretching herself&#xD;
half out of it.&#xD;
Quick as lightning Isabel Varick turned and poured some&#xD;
drops into the fresh tumbler that Louise had been watching so&#xD;
long.&#xD;
A goat uttered its tremulous gutteral cry.&#xD;
"What is that ?" said Mrs. Varick, in the same careless&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"That is the goat that nursed my Rose," said the bonne,&#xD;
suddenly turning, and approaching, she took up the glass apd&#xD;
smelled it.-" The poor old creature cam no m  i nibble a&#xD;
.spike of grass&#xD;
"She shall be killed too to-morrow," s  Madam; we can't&#xD;
have the toothless pets of dead people "about, to disturfthe&#xD;
rest of the living."&#xD;
"You will kill the foster-mother of my little Rose-that&#xD;
suckled the only daughter of this grande famille !!" cried the&#xD;
bonne. " Ohv, monstre !"&#xD;
&#xD;
8t&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="492-493" xml:id="VAC6853-00000248"/>&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
A dizziness seized old Louise, her eyes closed involuntarily.&#xD;
Mrs. Varick took the glass and averting her own face as much&#xD;
as possible, administered two or three spoonfuls successively to&#xD;
her aunt, then set down the tumbler, and quitted the room.&#xD;
Johnson (easy conscience he had doubtless!) was snoring in&#xD;
the porter's arm-chair. Mrs Varick glanced at him with con-&#xD;
tempt.-" He can be of use yet," thought she. Then up stairs&#xD;
she bounded to her daughter's room. On the landing of the&#xD;
first floor, where all the doors of the drawing-room suite looked&#xD;
upon the glittering marble hall, it struck her disagreeably, as&#xD;
it sometimes does superstitious people, that there should be so&#xD;
many silent and vacant rooms upon that hall, which she must&#xD;
constantly pass. In every door was a key of shining metal.&#xD;
Were they all locked ? Isabel went round trying them. Every&#xD;
one locked fast. Hence any one who might be in the suite&#xD;
was there as in a prison, unless perchance the dooi on the ser-&#xD;
vants' stair were open. This suspicion caused her to unlock&#xD;
the state-bedroom, and lighting one of the wax candles always&#xD;
there for show, she examined the back passage. Here there&#xD;
was neither egress nor ingress ; the doors were locked and the&#xD;
keys away. On the inside they were bolted. Recognizing the&#xD;
wisdom of this arrangement, Madam   Isabel returned. She&#xD;
could not forbear a glance at the splendid quiet of that chamber.&#xD;
Soon all this would be hers. Aunt Dashon was dying, perhaps&#xD;
dead; uncle could not long survive : the proofs of Rosemary's&#xD;
decease (could any one doubt it) were in her reach. She looked&#xD;
around and felt herself mistress of this splendor and of all the&#xD;
power and wealth it represented.&#xD;
She did not like the design of the sculptured mantel-the&#xD;
Genii of Marriage and Death supporting the classic entabla-&#xD;
ture, the  _tre of which bore so mysteriously the word" ROsE-&#xD;
MARY," while festoons of the plant of gr ay renown depended&#xD;
betwixt, flowing spray and clustered flower. That wall of the&#xD;
rooe was odious to her : for in the recess at either side hung&#xD;
a portrait-here Rosemary's father, there her mother, hiding&#xD;
the satin-draped walls. Mrs. George Varick liked better the&#xD;
window side, where draperies of white satin fringed with bul-&#xD;
lion, chastely enveloped the huge central mirror, with its&#xD;
&#xD;
492&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
493&#xD;
&#xD;
THE POISONER AND THE GHOST.&#xD;
&#xD;
princely dressing-table and sumptuous chairs, placed for a&#xD;
regal toilet. But here a new feature caught her eye-on the&#xD;
table, on a low pedestal of ormolu, and reflected in the mirror,&#xD;
stood the bust of the "Marble Bride." Isabel had heard of,&#xD;
she had never seen it. Nerving herself with a coward's cour-&#xD;
age, she lifted her candle to view it better-that only relic of'&#xD;
her victim's once famed loveliness. The beauty, the seren-&#xD;
ity, the immovable dignity of that marble Rosemary were a&#xD;
cutting reproach. She hated the mouth above all-it was so&#xD;
perfect, so pure and so passionless ! Her hatred fairly boiled&#xD;
over.-" I will crush you to powder yet !" she murmured&#xD;
between her squirrel teeth. She had moved the light-a deri-&#xD;
sive smile suddenly played on the- marble lips. She started&#xD;
back, then seeing that with the change of the shadows the&#xD;
smile disappeared, her fool's courage returned, and she laughed.&#xD;
A faint rustle of garments behind her !&#xD;
"A       a      a      h ! ! !"&#xD;
It was an inarticulate cry of wordless terror.&#xD;
In the middle of the chamber, not two yards distant, between&#xD;
the mantel and the bed, stood Rosemary Dashon in her bridal&#xD;
array. Her glittering robes swept the carpet; her form, jew-&#xD;
elled, veiled, softly budding, was defined against the gloom ;&#xD;
her eyes sparkled with loving anger. She was only half turned&#xD;
towards Isabel. The guilty woman retreated slowly, step by&#xD;
step, to place the bed between her and the beautiful yet terri-&#xD;
ble apparition; slowly, step by step, still regarding her, the&#xD;
vision gli4 d to the door, opened it, passed out, and what is&#xD;
a very unusual proceeding on the part of a ghost, shut the door&#xD;
after her and locked it. From the inside a scream, and shouts&#xD;
of hysterical laughter !&#xD;
From below, wailing cries !&#xD;
Down the great staircase flies Rosemary. She encounters&#xD;
Mr. Johnson crying out-" Madam ! madam ! your aunt is&#xD;
dying !"-At sight of her the man started lack and crouched&#xD;
like a cat in a corner of the landing-place  She passed him&#xD;
without notice and flew to grandmamma's room. Louise was&#xD;
on her knees, sobbing and praying : that shining presence&#xD;
caused her to cease both, and cry, in a tone of awe, "0 ciel !"&#xD;

&#xD;
The first thing Rose did was to administer Dr. Mannikin's&#xD;
antidote ; the next, to run to the open window and call: "Rory&#xD;
Rory !"-the next, to order Louise to open the dining-room&#xD;
windows. To describe the joy of the poor boanne, the frantic&#xD;
things she did, the unutterable transport with which she em-&#xD;
braced the hands, the knees, the feet of her fosterling, is beyond&#xD;
the power of the pen. Mr. Rory O'Morra and Thunder were&#xD;
admitted by the dining-room window, the balcony whereof had,&#xD;
we remember, a flight of steps to the garden. They were just&#xD;
in time to admit Mr. Rory's father by the front door. Thunder&#xD;
was not useless in this crisis, for Mr. Johnson, recovered from&#xD;
his fright, having found Madam Isabel, was disposed to show&#xD;
fight in a very singular manner, set himself blusteringly against&#xD;
the door, drew a revolver, and declared that he would defend&#xD;
the 'ouse with his 'eart's blood.&#xD;
Rory O'Morra, usually so brave, sank back into one of the&#xD;
hall chairs without a word, or an effort to overawe or over-&#xD;
power the bully. There was no one else in the hall ; but Ma-&#xD;
dam Isabel looked over the balustrade from above, and said to&#xD;
Johnson-" Shoot him-he is a burglar !"-and Johnson stepped&#xD;
forward, levelling his weapon at the young man's breast : in a&#xD;
moment it was all over with Rory O'Morra, when the huge St.&#xD;
Bernard sprang at the uplifted arm, throwing the rascal down&#xD;
with the force of the blow and his enormous weight, and held&#xD;
him betwixt his teeth. Then Rory rose, dragged himself to&#xD;
the street door, and drew the massy bolts. Mr. O'Morra had a&#xD;
couple of officers with him, who took Mr. Johnson into custody.&#xD;
" As for you, madam," said he, addressing Mrs. Varick,&#xD;
"one of these gentlemen will escort you to your own house&#xD;
over the way, unless you prefer the alternative of the station-&#xD;
house."&#xD;
"My daughter is dangerously ill upstairs. Will you force&#xD;
a mother from her child's sick-bed ?" demanded Isabel, with&#xD;
effrontery.&#xD;
"Your daughter will be taken good care of. This lady"--&#xD;
pointing to Mrs. Grace-" will see to it. She won't poison her,&#xD;
you may rely on it, madam. So, go at once, I say '--stamping&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
his foot :-" do you understand that I am master here, and&#xD;
that I can send you to the Tombs, if I like ?"&#xD;
"Your time has come at last, Cahal O'Morra," said Isabel;-&#xD;
'but as for that traitor"-with a glance of supreme contempt&#xD;
at Dr. Mannikin, who had also arrived with the senior O'Morra-&#xD;
" I know him now perfectly-and he knows me !"&#xD;
Galenson was also on hand. Mr. O'Morra had so combined&#xD;
his movements that both these gentlemen were sent for without&#xD;
causing him a moment's loss of time. Both went straight into&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon's room, and instantly returned.&#xD;
"How is Madam ?" asked Mr. O'Morra.&#xD;
"Mrs. Dashon is all right," said Mannikin, with his spectral&#xD;
smile. "Miss Rose has learned a trick of our science."&#xD;
"The first thing, I apprehend, is to look after your son," said&#xD;
Galenson, significantly.&#xD;
Rory had dropped into his chair again, and his head was&#xD;
hanging down. He could not raise it. His breathing showed&#xD;
distress.&#xD;
Galenson felt his pulse, and listened at the chest.&#xD;
"Congestion of the lungs and raging fever ! He must be got&#xD;
to bed instanter. You say he drove from Firhead Beach to-&#xD;
night ? Why, he ought not to have the strength of a drowned&#xD;
kitten !"&#xD;
"Is Rory down ?" said Rose, coming out of her grandmother's&#xD;
room. "I surely expected that ! Where shall he be taken ?&#xD;
\ The state bedchamber is the nearest. It was always meant to&#xD;
lodge a prince-bear Mr. Rory thither."&#xD;
The daughter of the house found linen in the closets, and&#xD;
with her own hands prepared the bed, Mrs. Grace assisting;&#xD;
while in the adjacent dressing room, Mrs. Grace's husband&#xD;
aided Cahal- O'Morra to disrobe his nearly unconscious and&#xD;
wholly helpless Son.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
FRESH ORANGE-BLOSSOMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
CERTAINLY MadamIsabel had combined her plans admira-&#xD;
bly. In the first place what more natural than that a whole&#xD;
party should be taken sick on entering a mouldy vault ? Next,&#xD;
was not her own daughter among the chief sufferers, and an&#xD;
uncle whose life it was her direct interest to preserve ? It was&#xD;
well contrived to send the physician who could have instantly&#xD;
relieved them all, a message which took him in haste to Rocka-&#xD;
way, so that at the moment he was wanted, he was twenty&#xD;
miles distant. What more natural or suitable under those cir-&#xD;
cumstances than to call in the brother of the principal patients,&#xD;
himself deeply interested in preserving his sister's life ? To&#xD;
refuse, on the arrival of the other doctor, to change the treat-&#xD;
ment in the case of the aunt, and to change it in regard to the&#xD;
daughter, what more natural, or less liable to cavil, or in fine,&#xD;
more shrewdly calculated ? If under the one treatment the&#xD;
daughter recovers, and under the other the aunt dies, the dif-&#xD;
ference of systems accounts for that ; Dr. Mannikin s syste&#xD;
was right ; Dr. Varick's was wrong : one doctor saved ha.&#xD;
patient; the other killed his ; certainly Mrs.  'ck, who actec.&#xD;
on the best of her judgment, could not be res. ible for such&#xD;
a result.&#xD;
Once this well-considered scheme nearly failed through the&#xD;
vigilance of the old bonne ; then, it was on the very point of&#xD;
success : had Miss Rose been a minute later (said Mannikin)&#xD;
Mrs. Dashon was past his skill. He had great power, with his&#xD;
secret poisons and his mysterious antjdotes, but he could not&#xD;
raise the dead. As for Rose, she could only claim the.credit&#xD;
of courage, promptitude and presence of mind ; thereal hero&#xD;
of the occasion, she observed, was Rory O'Morra, who had ex-&#xD;
posed his life to bring her to the spot in time and had had the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
FRESH ORANGE-BLOSSOMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
generosity to conceal both his dangers and his sufferings, till&#xD;
nature could resist no longer. Galenson, whom Rory had con-&#xD;
sulted at least a month previously, and who had warned him of&#xD;
the fatal result of his imprudent rigors, shook his head over&#xD;
the case. Unless the young man should have another sponta-&#xD;
neous hemorrhage, this relapse would go hard with him. It&#xD;
was the third time that Rory had been seized with pulmonary&#xD;
congestion in less than a month : in the former attacks the&#xD;
vital depression had been slight ; in the present one it was of&#xD;
the utmost gravity.&#xD;
The sufferers by Mrs. Varick's well planned attempt were all&#xD;
doing well. Dr. Mannikin reported that Miss Augusta would es-&#xD;
cape with a simple headache : Mrs. Dashon would only suffer in-&#xD;
convenience from her brother's heroic remedies. Mr. Dashon hav-&#xD;
ing been for some time under the habitual influence of the same&#xD;
drug, either taken in a liquid form or inhaled, experienced from&#xD;
this overdose an effect truly wonderful. In the first confusion&#xD;
consequent on the discovery of young O'Morra's dangerous&#xD;
condition, Mr. Dashon was overlooked. When Rosemary, hav-&#xD;
ing done what a hospitable maiden could, quitted the room pre-&#xD;
pared for her friend, stealing down stairs and listening as she&#xD;
went, she caught a familiar sound. She quickened her steps.&#xD;
Opposite grandmamma's door, that of grandpapa's room also&#xD;
atood open ; within, a feeble glimmer of light. She stole to&#xD;
te door, listened, glided in, cautiously raised the gas a little&#xD;
Id approached the bed.&#xD;
b The grand ' '" face, the white hair streaming back, the&#xD;
t arge-lidded cgg eyes of the old man ! How long since she&#xD;
had been so near him! He breathed heavily-the room was&#xD;
close. There needed open windows and a draught on that hot&#xD;
summer night. She could not raise the heavy shutters, but&#xD;
she threw open the sash of the conservatory and raised the&#xD;
ventilator of athe apartment. The air grew fresh and sfveet ;&#xD;
the old man breathed more easily. She wondered that he had&#xD;
been left unwatched, untended. She drew a chair and sat&#xD;
down beside the bed. Was not Louise watching grandmamma,&#xD;
who, besides, already had fallen into the deep sweet slumber&#xD;
of healthy old age 1 After a while it occurred to her that the&#xD;

&#xD;
light in the hall was sufficient, and that it would be better to&#xD;
turn down the gas. As she resumed her seat, her garments&#xD;
rustled, and grandpapa awoke. The light from the hall en-&#xD;
tered obliquely, and so it happened that Rosemary sat pre-&#xD;
cisely where it fell upon her face and figure. The old man&#xD;
gazed at her awhile in silence and evidently in profound aston-&#xD;
ishment.&#xD;
"Rose ?" he said at last, in a deep and awful whisper.&#xD;
She was not prepared for his speaking. She knew that he&#xD;
had not spoken for months. She drew near and took his hand,&#xD;
saying: " Grandpapa !"&#xD;
"Has a spirit such soft hands ?" said grandpapa, tremulously.&#xD;
"It is not a spirit-it is your Rosemary herself," said the&#xD;
girl, in a soothing voice ; and bending down kissed him.&#xD;
That 'sweet warm breath of youth, that velvet touch, he&#xD;
could not be deceived in those.&#xD;
"Stand back-stand in the light !" said grandpapa, rising on&#xD;
one elbow with astonishing vigor.&#xD;
She drew back and stood with bending modesty, bowing her&#xD;
head in the light.&#xD;
"You were to have been married ?" he said, glancing at her&#xD;
dress. "Have you just risen from the grave? Did you lie six&#xD;
months in that gloomy vault? Once I heard your voice there.&#xD;
Is this too a strong hallucination ?"&#xD;
The old man sank back on his pillow and gazedati&#xD;
wildly :-.'Phantom! Begone !"-.-In a terrible voice.t&#xD;
"It is I, your very Rosemary," said the girl, "alive and&#xD;
the body. For months I have hovered arQu 1 you in your&#xD;
daily drives. It was my voice you heard in the vault-dear&#xD;
grandpapa !"&#xD;
"There it is again !"&#xD;
"Feel my hands, my dress, my ornaments-does a ghost&#xD;
wear lace and pearls, grandpapa ?"-Extending her bracelet.&#xD;
" Those are the thoughts of my Rose," said grandpapa, in a&#xD;
quiet tone, "and certainly I am awake. I have dreamed for&#xD;
months then. I thought you were dead and buried, Rosemary."&#xD;
Just thou Dr. Mannikin, calling to mind his great patient,&#xD;
came down and entered the room. Rose offered him her chair,&#xD;
&#xD;
7I&#xD;
&#xD;
and described briefly what had occurred. Mr. Dashon drank&#xD;
in every word. He knew Mannikin.&#xD;
"Mr. Dashon is wonderfully better-a complete revulsion&#xD;
has been effected," said the physician, but without any elation&#xD;
of manner. "It would be well for him to seize the opportunity&#xD;
of making his will."&#xD;
"Why ?" said Mr. Dashon, bluntly.&#xD;
"Oh, no danger at all, my dear sir-quite the contrary,. I&#xD;
hope"-with a significant glance at Rose: "but to provide&#xD;
against all contingencies. Luckily, Mr. O'Morra is upstairs."&#xD;
"What O'Morra is that ?" said Mr. Dashon, "and why is&#xD;
he here ?"&#xD;
"There has been trouble in the house to-night," said Man-&#xD;
nikin, "which is now happily over. Every one is doing well&#xD;
but the son of Mr. O'Morra ?"&#xD;
"How is Mr. Roy ?" half whispered Rose.&#xD;
" In a bad way, fear," said Mannikin.&#xD;
"Bleeding again !" cried Rose, rising and turning very pale,&#xD;
" I wish he were. It is his only chance of life."&#xD;
"You don't mean that ?"&#xD;
"The symptoms are very unfavorable, Miss Dashon."&#xD;
"Is the danger immediate ?" Rose asked faintly.&#xD;
"A few hours will decide it. Unless a natural crisis super-&#xD;
vene, he cannot hold out much longer, and any moment may&#xD;
terminate the struggle," said the physician, in an icy tone.&#xD;
"And he was doing so well a few hours since !" said Rose,&#xD;
bursting into tears. "I have killed him. He has deliberately&#xD;
sacrificed his own life to save grandmamma's !"&#xD;
"Of whom are you speaking, Rose ?" said her grandfather,&#xD;
with agitation. "Who is this young O'Morra ?"&#xD;
"A gentleman, grandpapa, whose name, if he is really&#xD;
going to die, I desire to bear till my own dying day."&#xD;
'"Were you to/dlIave been married to him to-night?"-&#xD;
Glancing again at her dress.&#xD;
"No, grandpapa,"--kneeling down by the bedside-" but&#xD;
by your kind consent I will be."&#xD;
"A son of Cahal O'Morra ? I know his father," said Mr.&#xD;
Dashon.&#xD;

"Grandmamma herself gave me to him unasked-a month&#xD;
ago !" said Rose, hiding her face in the pillow.&#xD;
"That is enough," said grandpapa, laying his hand on her&#xD;
head. "My poor child, God bless you. A dreary future, I&#xD;
fear, is before you."&#xD;
"There is hope in faith and prayer," exclaimed Rosemary,&#xD;
springing to her feet.&#xD;
*. *     *&#xD;
The youth was panting for breath. His father wiped the&#xD;
dews from the pale and clammy brow. Rory was propped up&#xD;
with pillows ; in a recumbent posture he would have suffo-&#xD;
cated. Yet his voice was strong.-" Give me air-air !" he&#xD;
said, almost fiercely. They had flung open door and window&#xD;
in every direction. The night breeze swept through the&#xD;
apartment, laden with the sweetest perfume from innumerable&#xD;
flowers, blending with orange blossoms. Still the youth called&#xD;
wildly for "Air !"&#xD;
Rosemary entered, approached and took his hand.&#xD;
" Had I but finished my work, Rose," said the young sculp-&#xD;
tor, turning to her.       .&#xD;
"If I could die for you, Rory !" answered the girl, in a&#xD;
broken voice.&#xD;
"How long can I last in this state, Galenson ?" asked young&#xD;
O'Morra.Y&#xD;
"Not many hours, unless there is a change," said Galenson,&#xD;
with a slight quiver of his heavy lips.&#xD;
"You hear that, Rose-do what is necessary for your&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
"Immediately."&#xD;
"No; wait till morning breaks-I shall last till then."&#xD;
"The doctor has~told me, dear Rory, that any moment--"&#xD;
"I have more life in me yet than these old fogies think."--&#xD;
With his old smile,&#xD;
She whispered a question, brightly coloring.&#xD;
"Of course," he answered, with a smile of ineffable tender-&#xD;
ness. She quitted the room. Cahal O'Morra neither groaned&#xD;
nor wept, but his countenance was the picture of despair.&#xD;

&#xD;
After a while Mannikin re-entered the room.&#xD;
"Mr. Dashon," said he, "is perfectly lucid; he can speak&#xD;
and use his hands and limbs ; it is the opportunity so long de-&#xD;
sired, in which he may dictate and execute his will; and there&#xD;
is no knowing how long it will last."&#xD;
He addressed Mr. O'Morra.&#xD;
"Let them send for Plaidoyer-I cannot leave my son."&#xD;
"My father," said Rory, "it is Rosemary's fortune which is&#xD;
at stake. Do not let me prevent its being secured."&#xD;
"My son, you ask impossibilities-I could not draw up a&#xD;
will, if I would."&#xD;
Bring me paper and ink," said Rory O'Morra. "I am a&#xD;
lawyer-air! air !-paper and ink, I say, instantly !"&#xD;
Galenson remonstrated.&#xD;
"You see that escritoire; bring me paper and ink, I say,&#xD;
or I will jump out of bed and get them," said the young man,&#xD;
fiercely.&#xD;
"Invincible will!" murmured his father, going to the escri-&#xD;
toire, where he sat down and wrote. With an effort of self-con-&#xD;
centration peculiar to the disciplined intellect, but in which&#xD;
the will has a mighty share, Cahal O'Morra turned his attention&#xD;
from his dying son and fi-xed it on the property and known&#xD;
wishes of his client. In about half an hour he had drawn up&#xD;
an instrument, brief but sufficient, and containing all neces-&#xD;
sary clauses and provisions. While his father was writing, the&#xD;
young man, though his distress obviously increased, never&#xD;
uttered a word. When it was finished he asked to hear it read,&#xD;
and made a legal objection, which his father admitted, and&#xD;
inserted a few words to guard against it. Rosemary, who had&#xD;
returned, said that her grandfather was asleep, and that he&#xD;
must not be disturbed.&#xD;
"We have done our part," said Rory.&#xD;
Dr. Mannikin in the meantime had been gazing at the&#xD;
patient with folded arms and an expression of inscrutable pla-&#xD;
cidity, such as is seldom seen unless in born Quakers. When&#xD;
Dr. Galenson administered a stimulant, as he did every fifteen&#xD;
minutes, Mannikin smiled slightly and contemptuously. At&#xD;

&#xD;
last he touched the elder O'Morra's arm, and beckoned him&#xD;
into the adjacent room.&#xD;
"What is it '?" asked O'Morra, with a wild yet piercing&#xD;
glance. .&#xD;
"Trust him entirely to me,-Sand I can save him yet. This&#xD;
young man knows nothing."&#xD;
"Do what you like," said O'Morra, quickly.&#xD;
" Hush! let us understand each other. This is no occasion&#xD;
for beating about the bush. If I save your son, I must have&#xD;
my own terms."&#xD;
"Take my whole fortune."&#xD;
"You can afford that, since, if he lives, he weds the heiress&#xD;
of the Dashons. That is not what I want."&#xD;
"Speak out," said Cabal O'Morra, sternly.&#xD;
"You have in your hands at last the proof of Isabella Var-.&#xD;
ick's guilt. I know what you intend. Forego your vengeance&#xD;
and save your son."&#xD;
"I seek not vengeance-but I must protect the lives of&#xD;
others-my clients.  You yourself, Mannikin, are not safe,&#xD;
while this woman goes-unpunished."&#xD;
"I can protect myself, and I prefer my reputation to my&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"And I prefer a pure conscience to the life of my only son,"&#xD;
said O'Morra in a dry, unimpassioned tone. "Know this, how-&#xD;
ever, that if you use not your utmost skill to save your patient,&#xD;
I will make your reputation the most unenviable that physi--&#xD;
clan ever had."&#xD;
"I defy you," said Mannikin. "Dr. Galenson is one of the&#xD;
most skilful men in the profession, and he is doing all that&#xD;
the art of medicine knows. I am not obliged to interfere with&#xD;
his patient, in the exercise of a skill beyond the schools."&#xD;
"What is it all about '" asked Rosemary, entering the room.&#xD;
"Rory is calling for you, sir."&#xD;
"I have offered to relieve the son of Mr. O'Morra by an infal-&#xD;
lible means, provided the measures to be taken against Mrs.&#xD;
Varick are abandoned," said Mannikin.&#xD;
"In other words," said Mr. O'Morra, turning back to Rose,&#xD;
who held him, "I am to leave your grandparents and you at&#xD;
&#xD;
her mercy, in order to save my own son. It does not admit of&#xD;
discussion. Let me pass, Miss Dashon."&#xD;
Rose drew back with reverence, and closed the door upon&#xD;
him. She turned to Mannikin. Could he really save Mr.&#xD;
Rory.?&#xD;
"If I fail, the conditions are forfeit."&#xD;
"Be generous, and trust to our gratitude."&#xD;
"The gratitude of Cahal O'Morra !"&#xD;
- '' You set a price upon your patient's life !"&#xD;
" Shall I save it for a man who intends deliberately to plunge&#xD;
me into the depths of infamy '?"&#xD;
" He shall not."&#xD;
" You cannot prevent him."&#xD;
" Can I offer nothing '?" said Rose, turning pale, half with&#xD;
anxiety, half with shame to be bargaining with such a man for&#xD;
a life so dear.&#xD;
" Nothing short of yourself," said the physician, with his&#xD;
spectral smile.&#xD;
"That is impossible, since it would be a crime, Dr. Mannikin."&#xD;
"In a few weeks it will cease to be one."&#xD;
"I am betrothed to Mr. Rory O'Morra," said Rose, haughtily.&#xD;
"All that a man has will he give for his life," rplied the&#xD;
physician.&#xD;
The girl replied by a glance of contempt, and returned to&#xD;
the side of her lover. Everywhere it passed, that glittering&#xD;
bride-like form seemed to contradict the idea of death. Yet&#xD;
opposite to the very bed where O'Morra panted for life, and&#xD;
Rosemary leaned, whispering, prayers and 'holding his cold&#xD;
band, was that mysterious mantel, with "Rosemary" in the&#xD;
entre, and on either side the genii of wedlock and of death-&#xD;
a pagan design, yet not less sibylline and prophetic. This was&#xD;
the chamber long since promised to Rose for her nuptials, and&#xD;
never to be used on a less occasion; reserved, in fact, for that.&#xD;
Here was placed the bust of the "Marble Bride ;" here the&#xD;
portraits of her father and her mother looked down upon their&#xD;
child. It was characteristic of Rory O'Morra that in- spite of&#xD;
his extreme peril-for at any moment he was liable to suffoca-&#xD;
tion-he would not allow a clergyman to be sent for till the&#xD;

&#xD;
earliest streak of dawn showed itself on the walls of the cham-&#xD;
ber. In the meantime Rose had made all needful preparations.&#xD;
Old Louise bustled about as if it were the most joyful occasion&#xD;
in the world, and insisted on replacing the artificial flowers in&#xD;
her 'mistress's attire, with a fresh wreath and bouquets of&#xD;
orange blossoms from the green-house.&#xD;
"This is the saddest garland I ever wore," said her young&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
"Not near so triste as that," replied the bonne, flinging the&#xD;
discarded wreath out of the window.&#xD;
The sun had risen and was pouring in his first roseate rays&#xD;
at the north windows, when the priest arrived. They shot&#xD;
athwart the white forms of the "Marble Bride" and changed&#xD;
them (as the Alpine snow-tops are changed in the same bright-&#xD;
ness) to rose ; while softer shadows slept in every gentle hollow,&#xD;
and a smile of heavenly serenity beamed upon the rose-tinged&#xD;
lips. The sculptured mantel caught the glow, the torch of&#xD;
Hymen was tipped with fire, the carved word "ROsEMARY"&#xD;
shone out in golden letters on a ground of shadows: the&#xD;
parental portraits on the wall above. seemed to wake and&#xD;
breathe  in the warni reflected  light.  The room    was&#xD;
cleared for a few minutes. Then all came in again, came in&#xD;
andknelt; ttere were lighted tapers on a table covered with&#xD;
a$ wy cloth; the vases on the mantel were filled with fresh&#xD;
fi   rs. Old Andrew'Horton had brought them in. RIosemary's&#xD;
grandparents were there ; grandpapa had come upstairs lean-&#xD;
ing on the arm of his granddaughter alone. Sacrament after&#xD;
sacrament was administered, and last, a ring was blessed, hands&#xD;
were joined, a bride given away. Rosemary leaned forward.&#xD;
with a tender blush notwithstanding his mortal agony, to receive&#xD;
her husband's first and last embrace. Rory O'Morra ceased&#xD;
panting, he held her for a moment ; suddenly his arms tightened&#xD;
about her convulsively ; with difficulty she disengaged herself;&#xD;
the bridegroom lay white and senseless, and all were horrified&#xD;
to see that the bride's whole person was deluged with blood.&#xD;
Amid the general consternation Galenson's heavy features&#xD;
were radiant with 'joy, and Mannikin, after a moment's close&#xD;
scrutiny of that pale countenance, with the look of a baffled&#xD;
deaon, strode out of the house.&#xD;

A STORMY interview was that between the worthy Dr. Ezekiel&#xD;
Mannikin and the excellent Mrs. Isabel Varick. The lady bit.&#xD;
terly reproached his treachery,&#xD;
"I have saved your neck, madam," said Ezekiel.&#xD;
"Disinterested friend! by whose advice I put it in jeopardy&#xD;
Rose Dashon was dosed by your counsel, you supplied the&#xD;
drug, I ran the risk, and all the while you merely meant to get&#xD;
her into your own hands, to restore her with your ready anti-&#xD;
dotes, and by working on her gratitude and fears, aided by&#xD;
your youthful attractions and the charms of your drab, to in-&#xD;
duce her to marry you! -'What did you intend doing with your&#xD;
wife, Ezekiel V"&#xD;
"Divorce her, madam."&#xD;
"You can't, sir,"&#xD;
"In a few weeks it will be an accomplished fact, mada&#xD;
"O'Morra has bought you at that price, eh 'P"&#xD;
" Tis one of the conditions of our bargain."&#xD;
"Iadmire candor above all things," said the lady.&#xD;
"The time to speak the truth comes at last," replied the&#xD;
Quaker.&#xD;
There is honor betwixt thieves I" said the lady, bitterly&#xD;
"It seems that you betray everybody-you will end by finding&#xD;
yourself famously betrayed."&#xD;
j"Whatever plans I had are now abandoned. Rosemary&#xD;

J 1"io whom'?" said the lady, suddenly changing her tone t&#xD;
one of simple curiosity.&#xD;
"'To the son. of Cahal O'Morra."&#xD;

&#xD;
CONCLUSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
507&#xD;
&#xD;
506 -ROSEMARY..&#xD;
are unreasonably angry with me for preferring my own to&#xD;
yours. I don't love you well enough to forego an immense&#xD;
fortune, that you and your children may enjoy it. I'dyn't&#xD;
love you well enough to forego the brightest hope of domestic&#xD;
happiness in order to wear your yoke for ever. -Youth, inno-&#xD;
cence and beauty"-with a malignant emphasis-" have charms&#xD;
for me, as well as others. If you expected anything else, you&#xD;
reckoned without your host. But interest is interest. This&#xD;
very morning I have employed means which I thought could&#xD;
not fail to arrest the vengeance O'Morra has prepared for you;&#xD;
for he cannot pursue it without dragging me down also. That's&#xD;
interest, Isabel. At this moment nothing stands between you&#xD;
and a prison but the inducements which I can yet offer that&#xD;
man. Is it worth our while to quarrel ?"&#xD;
"If you can curb O'Morra, you will do it for your dear sake,&#xD;
of course: for if I hang, Ezekiel, I promise you that you will&#xD;
swing too ; if I go to a prison, you-shan't escape. We are in&#xD;
the. same boat."&#xD;
"CNot altogether, madam. It can be easily shown that while&#xD;
you urged an autopsy of Rose Dashon, I opposed it; that while&#xD;
you, forestalling my action, had her taken from the vault, and&#xD;
delivered to anatomists, for the express purpose of destroying&#xD;
her life, I exerted myself to the utmost to save her. 1 can&#xD;
show that my limited participation in the crime proceeded from&#xD;
love, yours from hatred and cupidity. The attempt on your&#xD;
aunt's life, just foiled, is wholly yours. The very servants&#xD;
know that you did not permit me to prescribe for her. Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon can testify that I warned her in regard to the probable&#xD;
mode, of your attack, and directed her how to proceed th&#xD;
instant she found herself affected. I did not anticipate tht&#xD;
Infernal dexterity with which you upasized the whole family&#xD;
in a vault, continued the process while theywere driving home,&#xD;
and made your agent, under the plausible pretext of their very&#xD;
illness, close up the carriage when they were unable to pre-&#xD;
vent it, so as to exclude the fresh air, in itself almost a suffi-&#xD;
cient antidote. But for young O'Morra's skill in driving and&#xD;
promptitude of movement, the courage of Miss Dashon and&#xD;
your own cowardice, your aunt way a dead woman, madam.&#xD;
&#xD;
e.&#xD;
&#xD;
ry         N A A&#xD;
&#xD;
I admire your ability in the affair ; I disclaim any share in it."&#xD;
-And Mannikin, chuckling over his own perspicuous state-&#xD;
ment of the case, smiled his death's head grin in the face of&#xD;
Isabel Varick,~that grew paler and paler with hatred and sup-&#xD;
pressed fury. The squirrel mouth assumed its most vicious&#xD;
expression.&#xD;
The man was triumphant. He was still young ; there was&#xD;
nothing the woman could sneer at in him but his garb, which&#xD;
after all had a certain professional dignity ; but she had neither&#xD;
youth to charm nor virtue to inspire respect ; she was a crim-&#xD;
inal, and guilty passions had left their trail on all that once&#xD;
was beauty. Last of all and hardest to bear, the partner of&#xD;
her crimes proves to her that while he is on the safe side of&#xD;
the law, she is exposed to its penalties and dishonors.&#xD;
Nothing so dangerous as a woman thus driven to the wall&#xD;
by a man who has no right to such a triumph. It was not a&#xD;
good omen for Mannikin that Mrs. Varick dissembled her&#xD;
feelings.&#xD;
"Do what they like," said she, "they can't deprive me of&#xD;
my rights of inheritance. Uncle Dashon can never make a&#xD;
valid will."&#xD;
"Error !" replied Ezekiel. "Your own act has destroyed&#xD;
all your hopes on that side. What nearly cost your auit her&#xD;
life, has restored your uncle Dashon to the use of his mind,&#xD;
speech and limbs. It won't last long ; but even on his dying&#xD;
bed (as we all thought) that determined young O'Morra forced&#xD;
his father to draw up a will cutting you off without a cent, and&#xD;
long ere this it has been executed. Rosemary is your uncle's&#xD;
heiress by a testament past attacking on any ground whatever.&#xD;
Even her death won't help you now-you are excluded by&#xD;
name from any share in the property, directly or indirectly,&#xD;
under any possible circumstances. That's how you stand,&#xD;
madam, and I must say entirely by your own fault."&#xD;
Isabel Varick's features now expressed the most acute an-&#xD;
guish mingled with diabolical fury.&#xD;
"Curse them all and you too !" she cried in a voice nearly&#xD;
inarticulate with rage. "Well, let O'Morra do his worst:+le&#xD;
can but plunge their name and race into infamy. Rather than&#xD;

it should fail I will do it myself ! And as for you! viper that&#xD;
I have warmed in my bosom to betray her to whom you owe&#xD;
everything-beware! I can crush you too. Wretch! -out of&#xD;
my.sight!---"&#xD;
When Mannikin was gone, the woman sat down and wept.&#xD;
"Helen Tankerville," she said in a broken voice, "thou art&#xD;
avenged !"&#xD;
Yet the blow for some reason did not fall. Even Johnson,&#xD;
after a brief detention, was set at liberty, no one appearing&#xD;
against him; his wages were paid and he was dismissed. Cabal&#xD;
O'Morra took possession of Mrs. Varick's house in virtue of an&#xD;
old writ, expelled th occupants and shut up the premises. As&#xD;
the Varicks had   artments at Rockaway, the change was&#xD;
hardly obse    outside of the family. Mr. and Mrs. Varick&#xD;
were also notified that at the expiration of the currentmonth&#xD;
(August) their stipend would cease. There the threatened&#xD;
vengeance seemed suspended.&#xD;
The extraordinary twofold news of Mr. Dashon's restoration&#xD;
to health and Rosemary's return to life, flew like wild-fire. The&#xD;
first talk among all the brothers and sisters-in-law, their wives&#xD;
and husbands, of course ran on the will. Now it was sure to&#xD;
be executed. In the happy re-united family under grandpapa&#xD;
Dasiron's own roof, nothing was less talked or thought of. Mr.&#xD;
Dashon had executed immediately the will drawn up by Mr.&#xD;
O'Morra, as a mere security, with the avowed intention of pre-&#xD;
paring another at leisure in concert with that lawyer, to carry&#xD;
out more fully and minutely his intentions. He made memor-&#xD;
anda of his wishes and placed them in the lawyer's hands: all&#xD;
his relatives and his wife's relatives were mentioned according&#xD;
to his affection and their merits.&#xD;
Very happy man was grandpapa Dashon now. Except an&#xD;
extreme debility of the lower extremities, almost atrophied by&#xD;
disuse, there was little to remind him of his recent state of&#xD;
hopeless infirmity. His grandchild's presence was a perpetual&#xD;
joy. Hpr young husband, long since pronounced out of danger,&#xD;
was convalescing with rapidity. Rory owed as much to inde-.&#xD;
'atigable nursing as to medicine : Dr. Galenson acknowledged&#xD;
that. Grandpapa visited him daily, and spent several hours in&#xD;

CONCLUSION.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
his room. Rose was surely there. The whole range of that&#xD;
floor was soon accessible to the convalescent. Grandmamma&#xD;
too was very sensible that she owed her life probably to Rory,&#xD;
who in doing his part had risked and suffered more than any&#xD;
one. She regretted that he was not a marquis, but she allowed&#xD;
that his father's fame and his own genius, their princely lineage&#xD;
(which was undeniable when you knew a little of history-" do&#xD;
you understand ?") made amends for the want of a distinction&#xD;
enjoyed by hundreds of people whose blood was a mere mud-&#xD;
puddle.&#xD;
After all, too, their lot lay in America, where titles were of&#xD;
no account at all. Rory for his part considered what he had&#xD;
been able to dO for grandmamma as extremely commonplace&#xD;
and unheroic, and particularly regretted his inability to flatten&#xD;
out that rascally Johnson, to which Rose replied,-.-" It was&#xD;
game unworthy of you, Rory-Thunder was good enough to&#xD;
serve that wretched poltroon :"-and then Cahal O'Morra put&#xD;
in his bitter smile, half softened into kindly admiration of his&#xD;
daughter-in-law--" Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice&#xD;
nodus.-&#xD;
To say the truth, O'Morra played the invalid longer than&#xD;
was absolute need. A little reflection will enable us to&#xD;
understand why. Although Rory and Rosemary were mar-&#xD;
ried, there was a ceremony yet to be complied with-&#xD;
a choice privilege to be enjoyed-the nuptial benediction.&#xD;
This could only take place in church, and although it&#xD;
was not the essential, it was the most touching and solemn&#xD;
part of -the marriage rite. Rose Marie y tenait, -as she&#xD;
said she insisted on it as' her right and her glory ; and her&#xD;
grandparents, as soon as they understood the question, were&#xD;
mightily in her favor. A clinical ceremony, a death-bed mar-.&#xD;
iage, was sorely opposed to grandmamma's wishes in parti-&#xD;
cular ; she wanted pomp, festivity, a great concourse ; in short,&#xD;
a splendid wedding : even a mere wedding-party, no matter&#xD;
what eclat she might give to it, was not the thing ; but this fine&#xD;
distinction between matrimony made and matrimony solemn-&#xD;
ized, suited her exactly. It was not -precisely suitable, grand-&#xD;
mamma thought, that whereas Miss Dashon had disappeared"&#xD;

&#xD;
from the world on the instant before the celebration of her&#xD;
marriage was to have taken place in the face of the world,&#xD;
she should return to it, after six months, privately married to&#xD;
another person, with the necessity of infinite explanations as&#xD;
to the how and why and when. A public wedding in church&#xD;
was the happiest means of anticipating and answering such&#xD;
questions: all the world would then understand at once by&#xD;
what they saw, that a ceremony had passed, a contract had&#xD;
been made, when the bridegroom was supposed to be dying,&#xD;
which, on his recovery, was completed and hallowed by more&#xD;
public and more solemn rites, The period of this solemnity&#xD;
having been agreed upon, it was evident that as soon as Mr.&#xD;
Rory's convalescence should be fully established, he would be&#xD;
obliged to quit the hospitable roof of the Dashons and return&#xD;
home, a point of high decorum which the Church herself did&#xD;
not deem beneath her dignity expressly to command. Hence,&#xD;
the youth was slow to find himself quite well enough to&#xD;
change his quarters, and was easily persuaded by the polite&#xD;
urgency of the grandparents and the shy yet earnest entreaties&#xD;
of his bride, to defer his departure a few days, and a few days&#xD;
more.&#xD;
"I know what he will do the moment he finds himself at&#xD;
home; he will be' in that old studio from morning to-night,&#xD;
hurrying that statue to completion; as if there were need of&#xD;
such haste in getting up my monument !" said Rosemary.&#xD;
"'Twill be many years before I want it, I can tell you, sir !" .&#xD;
Galenson was appealed to.&#xD;
" If you would know whether O'Morra is fit to take a journey,&#xD;
I say yes," said the physician, -smiling: "he might resume his&#xD;
rides and walks and dumb-bells with safety ; but if you mean,&#xD;
is he fit to dream and rapturize over the wet clay ?-I say em-&#xD;
phatically that it will play the mischief with his convalescence."&#xD;
"Don't you think he will improve faster here than in Brook--&#xD;
lyn, doctor V' said grandmamma.&#xD;
"The air of New York is better for him than that of Brook-&#xD;
lyn at present," replied Galenson, laughing. /&#xD;
So Rory O'Morra remained at the Dashons', o nte ground&#xD;
of being an invalid, after he had joined the family at table, and&#xD;
&#xD;
"A&#xD;
&#xD;
CONCLUSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
51&#xD;
&#xD;
could walk in the garden with Rose before breakfast, and&#xD;
drive out with 'grandpapa, grandmamma and the beforemen-.&#xD;
tioned Rosemary in the lovely afternoons (but they never went&#xD;
to Greenwood), and was talking of a ride with the latter, on&#xD;
Arab and Sorella. It was wonderful what an appetite he had,&#xD;
and what pleasure Rosemary took in supplying it. He gained&#xD;
so rapidly both flesh and strength that he was ashamed to stay&#xD;
any longer; yet was so happy that he could not well endure&#xD;
to depart whije a decent excuse remained, even in the impor-&#xD;
tunities of others.&#xD;
There was another member of the family, and an invalid too,&#xD;
of whom we may make mention. This was Augusta Varick.&#xD;
The Dashons could not and would not turn Augusta out of the&#xD;
house ; young Mrs. O'Morra was unwearied in attentions to&#xD;
her. Augusta had experienced a terrible blow in Rosemary's&#xD;
return, perhaps a greater in the news of her marriage. Strange&#xD;
to say, although the first meeting of these cousins was care-&#xD;
fully prepared, so that Augusta might receive no shock, it&#xD;
affected her like an apparition. She dreaded to be touched&#xD;
by Rosemary, and trembled in her presence. Instead of rer-&#xD;
gaining her health and spirits, she grew daily worse; a cou&#xD;
supervened, a bright hectic flush appeared ; her curiosity s&#xD;
excited by her mother's absence; it became necessary to tell&#xD;
hethat Mrs. Varick could not be allowed to enter the house,&#xD;
but that she was at liberty to join her mother at Rockaway or.&#xD;
elsewhere, if she desired it. Augusta unhesitatingly preferred&#xD;
to remain where she was. She kept her room, where Mrs.&#xD;
Dashon paid her formal visits, Rosemary (as we have said)&#xD;
friendly ones and frequent, and where "cousin Rory," at her&#xD;
request, went several times to see her-for Augusta a danger-&#xD;
ous pleasure, full-of excitement at the time and followed by&#xD;
severe depression and almost incomprehensible languors. Dr.&#xD;
Galenson prescribed soothing anti-nervous remedies and said&#xD;

household Nemesis proceeded on his fatal path, the victim and&#xD;
her executioners alike unconscio s.&#xD;
A sad accident occurred at  ockaway, which prevented&#xD;
Miss Varick from laying aside her mourning, as she was anx-&#xD;
ious to do. Her father, bathing at an unusual hour, attended&#xD;
only by one of his servants, was carried away by the under tow&#xD;
and drowned. The servant barely escaped. The Dashons re-&#xD;
sumed their mourning on the day of the funeral, which they&#xD;
all attended. Grandpapa took the opportunity to invite his&#xD;
brothers and sisters-in-law to be present the next day at the&#xD;
execution of his will. It was generally observed that he did&#xD;
not speak to the widow; and the opinion was freely expressed&#xD;
that, be the cause what it might, she would be passed over.&#xD;
"Of course, aunt Dashon has uncle's ear-do you under-&#xD;
stand ?" said the widow, mimicking grandmamma's accent.&#xD;
" If he doesn't forget the children, I shan't complain."&#xD;
Rory had delayed his departure yet a few days more at&#xD;
grandpapa's request, in order .to be present on this occasion.&#xD;
In the evening grandmamma put on colors again, grandpapa&#xD;
and young Mrs. O'Morra retaining their black.&#xD;
"Dead, I consider poor George merely as my nephew," said&#xD;
grandpapa. "If he has injured me, I forgive him, as I hope&#xD;
to be forgiven."&#xD;
The conversation, starting thence, ran on religion. Mr.&#xD;
Dashon owned that he had neglected the subject all his life,&#xD;
and that he deeply regretted it now. At the same time he was&#xD;
quite uncertain what form of faith to choose. Rosemary play-&#xD;
fully recommended her own ; grandmamma was witty and&#xD;
skeptical; in her view it was purely a matter of exterior&#xD;
decency.-" Then I should be a Catholic," said grandpapa,&#xD;
" for beyond all question in externals that church has greatly&#xD;
the advantage."--" With us," said Rory, "religion is merely&#xD;
a matter of faith ; with Protestants, of feeling. To them, the&#xD;
importance we attach to certain ceremonies appears to render&#xD;
religion cold and heartless ; to us their rejection of the virtue&#xD;
of sacraments seems incredulity."&#xD;
" That very formality," said grandpapa, "is what impresses&#xD;
me in your religion. I have always been, a believer, but I&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
never could work myself into such a spiritual frame of mind as&#xD;
to fancy myself truly converted. I observed, Mr. Rory, that&#xD;
when we all thought you dying, the priest merely did things for&#xD;
you and let your frame of mind take care of itself."&#xD;
" You were not present when he heard my confession," said&#xD;
O'Morra, with a smile. "That was my preparation ; the rest&#xD;
were acts of my Saviour."&#xD;
"If I die suddenly, Rosey," said grandpapa, smiling, "send&#xD;
for your good Father N. to put me through."&#xD;
"Better send for him before, sir," said Rosemary, kissing his&#xD;
hand, which she was holding in hers.&#xD;
"That's true," said grandpapa, gravely. - "When the business&#xD;
of to-morrow-is disposed of, I will."&#xD;
Hereupon arrived Mr. Cahal O'Morra in a very cheerful&#xD;
mood. He saluted the grandparents and kissed his daughter-&#xD;
in-law, a privilege which his son (whose rights were too ample&#xD;
to dare enforce any) had never claimed since the eventful&#xD;
morn when he so happily covered her bridal garments with his&#xD;
blood.&#xD;
Mr. O'Morra had important news. He had at last negotiated&#xD;
with Dr. Mannikin the surrender of a document which Ezekiel&#xD;
claimed to possess, and which was, he pretended, of the highest&#xD;
interest to Rosemary and her grandparents. All cried out,&#xD;
demanding to see it.&#xD;
"Hear first the conditions on which he surrenders it; a sum&#xD;
of money" (naming it, and grandpapa said "Whew!"), "and the&#xD;
final abandonment of all vindictive measures against Madam&#xD;
Isabel."&#xD;
"It ought to be a valuable document indeed."&#xD;
"The second condition is almost inadmissible," said grand-&#xD;
mamma.&#xD;
"Mannikin adheres to two things, a fortune and a character.&#xD;
This bargain gives him one, and leaves him (as he thinks) in&#xD;
possession of the other."&#xD;
"The document !" cried every one.&#xD;
"It is a paper written by the late Dr. Tankerville for the&#xD;
losack Medical and Surgical Journal, and rejected by Dr.&#xD;

Edward Varick, its then editor, not less than eighteen years&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
Rosemary uttered an exclamation :-" Just after I was born !"&#xD;
" Exactly, my dear child. The paper is a full account of&#xD;
the circumstances attending your birth, when Dr. Tankervllle&#xD;
attended your mother. Your appearance, size, weight and&#xD;
imperfect development are described with scientific accuracy,&#xD;
and the means employed to preserve your life; how you were&#xD;
wrapped in cotton and suckled by a goat, and so forth: the&#xD;
whole proving, as a question of science and medical jurispru-&#xD;
dence, what is called the viability or capacity of life of an&#xD;
infant born in little more than six months after it began to&#xD;
exist. Connected with these facts, and although not absolutely&#xD;
necessary to establish the conclusion, yet powerfully supporting&#xD;
it, is the proof that your parents were married at such a time&#xD;
and no sooner. We lack hitherto, the evidence in a legal'&#xD;
sense that they.were married at all---"&#xD;
" The bishop's certificate," said Rosemary, with astonishment.&#xD;
" Conclusive to those who believe he wrote it, and who know&#xD;
his character, but not legal evidence at all. The statement of&#xD;
Louise is evidence, but it might be rebutted by showing her&#xD;
strong attachment to mother and child, and it is so weak&#xD;
morally that your grandfather Romarin always declined to use&#xD;
it. You will presently see that he was right. Dr. Tankerville&#xD;
asked your father for a written statement of the material facts ;&#xD;
that statement, in the form of a letter to the doctor, is incor-&#xD;
porated in the paper, in your father's own handwriting, and&#xD;
over his signature. That is evidence, legal and complete."&#xD;
"I don't grudge the money," said Mr. Dashon.&#xD;
" Nor I the other condition-do you understand ?" said&#xD;
grandmamma.&#xD;
" Your father, Rosemary (we won't read the letter now),&#xD;
goes into the history of his marriage from the first. Sometimes&#xD;
he reflects a little severely, I think unjustly, upon his own&#xD;
parents-."&#xD;
Grandpapa winced; grandmamma said: "Poor Dick !"&#xD;
" It appears that your father and mother, at the instigation&#xD;
of Louise-a bonne's motives are easily divined-committed the&#xD;

indiscretion of marrying by a simple contract in her presence.&#xD;
When Therese reported at head-quarters"-smiling at Rose-&#xD;
mary - " what she had done, she found herself in a terrible&#xD;
embarrassment. It was a valid marriage in the eyes of the law,&#xD;
invalid utterly in the eyes of the Church ; since Varick was&#xD;
not baptized.-' Disparitas cultus,' says Monseigneur, 'which&#xD;
occurs between a person baptized and one unbaptized, is an&#xD;
impedimentum dirimens. You are not married at all.' 'I will&#xD;
be baptized,' says young Dashon,-' That is good,' replies the&#xD;
bishop, C then I marry you, for what you have done now is good&#xD;
for nothing except in the eyes of the law.'-From a motive of&#xD;
prudence, the bishop even urged tlj there should be no&#xD;
delay. The ceremonies took place, as we all know, but have&#xD;
never before possessed legal evidence, in the church, on the&#xD;
13th of June, 1836. And now see of what value this evidence&#xD;
is. Louise has always asserted that she was present. She was&#xD;
not. Miss Romarin went to church as usual alone ; the bonne&#xD;
was to follow, but she was kept back by her master, and&#xD;
arrived after it was all over. Believing her mistress's honor at&#xD;
stake, she has lied about it from the first: a pretty witness she&#xD;
would have made before the Surrogate, with a keen lawyer on&#xD;
the other side ! But there was a witness, and one still living,&#xD;
Mrs. George Varick."&#xD;
"That is wonderful," Rosemary said.&#xD;
"What is to come is more so. This paper I will read you--&#xD;
it is enclosed by Varick with his own letter, and numbered as&#xD;
' A.'--&#xD;
"'I make the following statement for the satisfaction of my&#xD;
cousin, Richard Dashon.&#xD;
"'Last October my cousin gave a supper to his company at&#xD;
our house, on his being chosen captain. At about one'o'clock&#xD;
in the morning, as they were very noisy, aunt 'sent me down to&#xD;
request Dick to dismiss them; the few gentlemen who re-&#xD;
mained immediately took leave, but Richard, who was crazy&#xD;
with champagne, boisterously seized my hand and insisted on&#xD;
marrying me. To quiet him I consented, and we went through&#xD;
the ceremony before a couple Qf waiters, when Dick was taken&#xD;

greatest contrition for his rudeness, and disavowed any serious&#xD;

"'June 13th, 1836.'" -"'nieDashon.&#xD;
"I'll swear to that signature in any court of justice," said&#xD;
grandmamma. "Bell always signed in that way then."&#xD;
"With these documents," said Mr. O'Morra, "I will defend&#xD;
our Rosemary's rights as your heir-at-law in any court in the&#xD;
world. Except to save trouble, I wouldn't snap my finger for&#xD;
a will. Whether that paper be admitted as evidence or not,&#xD;
makes no difference. I have the solution in my hands, and if&#xD;
I did not make the witnesses, including madam herself, confirm&#xD;
every tittle of it, or entangle themselves in hopeless contradic-&#xD;
tions, my name is not Cahal O'Morra ! 'Tis a pity it can't be&#xD;
tried."&#xD;
"That, then, is what Bell meant by saying-' I will prove&#xD;
that her mother and Dick were never married, if I have to bring&#xD;
in myself guilty of bigamy.' The sense of that is very clear&#xD;
now-do you understand, Cornelius ?" said grandmamma.&#xD;
"I never believed there was any truth in it," said grandpapa.&#xD;
"My mother's innocence is proved beyond the possibility of&#xD;
cavil," said Rosemary, with a deep flush.&#xD;
"There can be no doubt on that head, my dear child,"'said&#xD;
Cahal O'Morra, who had never been thoroughly paternal to-&#xD;
wards Rose before: "that private contract was merely intended&#xD;
by your father to secure your mother, and;put it out of his own&#xD;
power to marry anybody else. Your grandpapa Romarin talked&#xD;
of sending her to a convent in Canada; your grandpapa Dashon&#xD;
here offered his son a little fortune inhand not to marry Miss&#xD;
Romarin ; but her conduct was delicacy itself, and they were&#xD;
married at last with the missa pro sponso et sponsa, for which&#xD;
you yourself are faithfully waiting. It is all in your father's&#xD;
letter,"-&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have the papers ?" asked grandpapa.&#xD;
"Of course. You can read them at your leisure. Their&#xD;
genuineness is beyond dispute. I can swear to Dr. Tanker-&#xD;
ville's handwriting myself, and your son's letter has passages&#xD;
marked in the doctor's hand, to be omitted by the printer.&#xD;
There is a direction to print the initials only of the names. In&#xD;
short, it is endorsed: 'To be given, in case of my death, to&#xD;
Captain Louis Romarin.' Mannikin (as you know, Rosemary)&#xD;
had all Dr. Tankerville's office-furniture and library; he found&#xD;
this precious document, saw instantly its importance, and kept&#xD;
it with a view to make his fortune by it some day. It is a fine&#xD;
proof of the want of mutual confidence in guilty connections,&#xD;
that in all these years he has never hinted to Mrs. Varick the&#xD;
existence of a paper which annihilates her hopes. But enough&#xD;
of this to-night. How are you, Rory ?"&#xD;
"So well, sir, that I should have been in Brooklyn on Mon-&#xD;
day, had not grandpapa insisted on my staying over to-morrow."&#xD;
",You have not the air of an invalid, upon my word. But&#xD;
pray, Mrs. O'Morra, indulge me with some music before I go."&#xD;
Rosemary played and sang. Her delicious voice filled the&#xD;
house, floating along the lofty halls, and passing out at the open&#xD;
windows, where it reached ears for which it was not intended,&#xD;
ears that listened as the devil listens to the songs of Paradise,&#xD;
that aggravate his agony. Rose had never sung, or touched&#xD;
an instrument, at Miss Tankerville's. Proud girl ! Her hus-&#xD;
band turned over the music.&#xD;
"A charming daughter to have !" said Cabal O'Morra.&#xD;
" Thank you, sir. We ought to have the violin from the&#xD;
studio, Rory," said the singer.&#xD;
"By and by," said the young sculptor, in a whisper, bending&#xD;
over her.&#xD;
So wine and fruit were brought in. Mr. O'Morra de#&#xD;
dined a bed, which grandpapa offered, and took leave. Rose-&#xD;
mary embraced her grandparents and shook hands, shyly and&#xD;
wistfully, with Rory O'Morra. The servants went round shut-&#xD;
ting up the house.&#xD;
Mr.,O'Morra had left the important papers to be lodged in&#xD;
Mr. Dashon's safe ; but Rory, whose eyes were always about&#xD;

him, considering that the windows had been open on the street&#xD;
and garden all the evening, suggested as a measure of precau-&#xD;
tion that they should be confided to him.&#xD;
"The house is well secured," said grandpapa.&#xD;
" Rose broke into it the other night !"&#xD;
"I have had those windows made secure, and the wall ren-&#xD;
dered inaccessible by a fan of spikes," said grandpapa, smiling.&#xD;
"I defy any other thing in petticoats to pass that way."&#xD;
" There are two rooms on the ground floor, of which the win-&#xD;
dows are open all night," replied Rory.&#xD;
" How will a robber get into my safe ' Not without waking&#xD;
me,, I warrant," said grandpapa.&#xD;
"I would rather they did not wake you, sir, as your health&#xD;
and life are of more consequence than the documents, be the&#xD;
value of the latter whatit may."&#xD;
"Well, take them, Rory," said Mr. Dashon.&#xD;
O'Morra put them under his pillow with a small revolver; he&#xD;
could not help smiling, for it was the first time he had ever&#xD;
done such a thing in his life.&#xD;
Rory slept soundly. In the middle of the night he was&#xD;
awakened by a noise--a heavy fall, it seemed, in the room&#xD;
below, which was Mr. Dashon's. Between his bed and the&#xD;
window passed a tall shadow! In an instant he had sprung&#xD;
out of bed on the other side, turned up the gas, and found&#xD;
himself confronting Dr. Mannikin, with a bottle in one hand&#xD;
and a sponge in the other. Ezekiel dropped both and heaped&#xD;
over the bed to escape. O'Morra was too agile for him; he&#xD;
caught the toxicologist by the collar, and threw him upon the&#xD;
floor. A fierce struggle followed. Mannikin was a man of&#xD;
great muscular power and O'Morra had not yet fully recovered&#xD;
strength. But the determination of the youth prevailed;&#xD;
*4kiel, nearly strangled, gasped for mercy. O'Morra dragged&#xD;
ybim across the floor, stupefied him with his own drug, threat-&#xD;
ening instant death if he resisted; as soon as he was helpless,&#xD;
the young man bound him hand and foot.&#xD;
This was done in less time than it takes to tell it ; O'Morra&#xD;
had slipped on part of his clothes and armed himself; in&#xD;
another hIf minute he was in grandpapa's room, where the&#xD;

&#xD;
CONCLUSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
519&#xD;
&#xD;
first thing that met his eye was Mr. Dashon on the floor, appa-&#xD;
rently senseless,. the safe open, and a man at the window&#xD;
throwing something out. The fellow looked back as Rory&#xD;
entered: it was Johnson ; he did not wait the young man's&#xD;
approach, but threw his legs over the balcony, evidently mean-&#xD;
ing to let himself down by the hands into the area and escape.&#xD;
The height seemed to daunt him ; the fellow was at bay ; he&#xD;
turned and drew a pistol ; but O'Morra, who was advancing to&#xD;
seize him, was too quick for a villain the measure of whose&#xD;
malice he had so often taken ; before the burglar's weapon&#xD;
was levelled, Rory had fired, and Johnson fell backward with&#xD;
a groan. When O'Morra reached the window, the wretch was&#xD;
most miserably impaled, on the railing, and a woman was seen&#xD;
running up the street.&#xD;
Poor grandpapa Dashon ! He breathed his last peacefully,&#xD;
in the arms of his children, conscious (so far as one could&#xD;
judge), and with every consolation of which his state admitted.&#xD;
He had received neither blow nor wound, but the shock had&#xD;
brought on that second stroke of paralysis, long impending,&#xD;
which no human means probably could have long delayed.&#xD;
* * *&#xD;
How shall we further trace this history'? Why mention that&#xD;
what Johnson threw out of the window was Mr. Dashon's will?&#xD;
Why detail the trial before the Surrogate, on which Mrs.&#xD;
Varick had the audacity to venture, O'Morra's unequalled&#xD;
argument, the crushing evidence, and the judge's decisio&#xD;
which, although it simply granted letters of administration to&#xD;
those who represented Rosemary as heiress-at-law, blasted&#xD;
Isabel's character forever ? Why relate Mannikin's mysterious&#xD;
escape, and more mysterious fate, in regard to which it remai&#xD;
uncertain if he perished by his own hand or by another&#xD;
The latter seems not improbable, for his cowardice was n&#xD;
ious, and in his last recorded rascality it appeared that&#xD;
acted under the basest terror.&#xD;
Roosevelt Varick has not been heard of since Rosemary'd&#xD;
return home. It is supposed that he is practising law in Cali.&#xD;
fornia under another name, with great success. With a gene:&#xD;

CONCLUSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
happiness, took Augusta to the south for the winter ; a vain&#xD;
experiment: her constitution had been undermined in child-&#xD;
hood by narcotics ; her mother's disgrace preyed on her spirits ;&#xD;
she died at St. Augustine.&#xD;
In the month of May of the year following these events, a&#xD;
party of the wealthiest class of people were assembled in&#xD;
Greenwood cemetery, to witness the opening and benediction&#xD;
of a beautiful mortuary chapel. There was a grand old lady,&#xD;
in widow's weeds, a young naval officer with his wife (Capt.&#xD;
Varick lives opposite Mrs. Dashon's on the Avenue, where&#xD;
Mrs. Isabel used, and a good many more of our acquaintances.&#xD;
The Athertons were there ; also the Colonel Marquis de Flordal.&#xD;
One of the ceremonies was that of depositing in this splen-&#xD;
did mausoleum the remains of Therese Dashon, boy n Romarin.&#xD;
They were laid beside those of her husband, Col. Richard&#xD;
Varick Dashon ; and an inscription recorded her ancestry,&#xD;
marriage, and how, at the age of twenty, Jan. 1, 1837, she sacri-&#xD;
ficed her life to save that of her child : the whole surrounded&#xD;
with a wreath of carved rosemary.&#xD;
Among those who witnessed this late reparation to the memory&#xD;
of an heroic mother, was to be noted a white-haired, white-mus-&#xD;
tached officer in a general's fatigue uniform, with a crape on his&#xD;
arm, and a decoration in his button-hole. This venerable soldier&#xD;
supported on his arm a most beautiful young woman, whose&#xD;
face was suffused with tears, but less of sorrow than of tender-&#xD;
ss and pride, when a veil was withdrawn, by the artist's own&#xD;
hand, from one of the arches of the chapel.&#xD;
Within the arch a sarcophagus, carved with a funeral pro-&#xD;
cession. The lid was off. Carelessly thrown over it, as if just&#xD;
ripped off, lay a rich robe wrought in the marble with the&#xD;
ost delicacy of detail. In front, upon the marble steps, a&#xD;
e of a spiritual beauty past expressing in words, and&#xD;
thing life, love and joy. The ace was a portrait ; every&#xD;
one felt that; but it was a great deal more.  Feminine it&#xD;
was ; every feature, every fold of the most simple drapery,&#xD;
expressed the gentler sex; but the courage that confronts the&#xD;
King of Terrors without a tremor gave firmness to every har-&#xD;
monious limb, and the heroic disdain of pleasure breathed on&#xD;
&#xD;
the upraised countenance, waved in the masses of the flower-&#xD;
crowned hair, and severely rose or fell in the fine pure outlines&#xD;
of a shape such as might have glowed amid the fires of martyr-&#xD;
dom. In a word, on this noble figure was inscribed that vic-&#xD;
tory over the senses and (harder yet) over the affections, in&#xD;
which it had been conceived, matured and executed. He who,&#xD;
profoundly sensitive to the Beautiful, has met and conquered&#xD;
its fascinations, he can make them subservient to the higher&#xD;
inspirations of his soul; and it is a choice for the artistic&#xD;
nature to be the master, the slave, or the victim of that magi-&#xD;
cal power. On the wall, within the arch where this exult-&#xD;
ing prophetess of immortality rejoiced in stone, were the words&#xD;
"IN SPE ;" that is, "In Hope ;" and over it in great sculptured&#xD;
letters, to mark the place of our heroine's future repose, when&#xD;
her life shall at last have really yielded to the temporary power&#xD;
of Death, the name&#xD;

It is not surprising that comparatively little is known in this&#xD;
country, save among the more intelligent Americans citizens from&#xD;
the "Emerald Isle,' of Gerald Griffin, when we consider that he&#xD;
was born in the beginning of the present century, and closed his&#xD;
brief, but really bright and brilliant, career of authorship at the&#xD;
early age of 37. He however achieved a reputation as a writer of no&#xD;
ordinary power, and as has been remarked, united all the simplicity&#xD;
and cordiality of Oliver Goldsmith, to much of the fiery energy and&#xD;
manly zeal of Robert Burns. We have now before us four volumes,&#xD;
the commencement of a complete edition of his works, embracing&#xD;
the " Collegians," and the first series of his "fMunster Tales." The&#xD;
nationality of these tales, and the genius of the author in depicting&#xD;
the mingling levity and pathos of Irish character, have rendered&#xD;
them exceedingly popular. TLe present edition is the first published&#xD;
in America. The style in which the series is produced, is highly&#xD;
creditable to the enterprise of the American publishers, and we are&#xD;
free to say, that the volumes are worthy of being placed in our&#xD;
libraries, public or private, alongside of Irving, Cooper or Scott.-&#xD;
