MAN.&#xD;
Washington wasa niil iary camp, and its usu-&#xD;
ally quiet streets eci. to the measured tread&#xD;
of armed men.     The. tai'-spangled .banner&#xD;
waved tranquilly over perturbed anefluctuat&#xD;
ng Baltimore, and Federal cannon bristled on&#xD;
Arlington and Georgetown Heights.   A long&#xD;
line of loyal bayonets gleamed brightly on the&#xD;
troubled borders of Virginia.  cCleilan and&#xD;
Patterson were advancing; the impatient col-&#xD;
umus of McDowell faced Fairfar and Manassas&#xD;
on the extreme left, Fortress Monroe frowned&#xD;
grimly on the defiant approaches of mad rebel-&#xD;
lion ; while the blockading squadron swarmed&#xD;
the Gulf.&#xD;
The disloyal States were beginning to feel the.&#xD;
power of the Government, the strength of the&#xD;
Union, the wrath of the North, and the glowing&#xD;
patriotism of the awakened West.&#xD;
The uprising of a free, brave, and industrious&#xD;
people is a grand, yet terrible spectacle.&#xD;
others wept over their gallant sons, and sent&#xD;
them to, the glorious .field. Sweethearts and&#xD;
wives kissed lovers and husbands, and hurried&#xD;
them to the great battle for freedom Gray.&#xD;
headed sires girded, the sword to their stalwart&#xD;
boys, and blessing them  with uplifted, trem-&#xD;
bling hands and husky voices, reminded them&#xD;
of W%.-iington ; that wounds in front are the&#xD;
glory of the soldier ; that to die for ones coun-&#xD;
tr is t I join the world's army of comnnemorat-&#xD;
heroes and martyrs. . . -&#xD;
Never was sucha sight seensince the Revo-&#xD;
lation. Party lines, were' forgotten; partisan&#xD;
- differences died thedeath, and the discordant&#xD;
tongue of demagogue-clamor was heard no more.&#xD;
There was political peace in- the North and in&#xD;
the West. The spirit of unaggimitf possessed all&#xD;
hearts. A .new crusade waS inaugurated. Fair&#xD;
women, stirred with a nobler enthusiasm than&#xD;
&#xD;
eret inspired the daughters of the conquering&#xD;
pilgrim  Cross, prepared laurels for their soi-&#xD;
dier-heroes, and cheered their hurried, eager&#xD;
march to Meet the isulting foe. The coldest&#xD;
blood grew warm; the inost stagnant currents&#xD;
began to flow, and all thought as from  one&#xD;
mighty brain. If here and there Treason dared&#xD;
to mutter, 'low 'down'in' its throat, the quick ver-&#xD;
diet of the People sent it, silentand shamed, to&#xD;
its own, laee.&#xD;
There was no conscription. Neither threats,&#xD;
nor wheedling, nor bribery, were resorted to, to&#xD;
fill the 'ranks of the Union hosts. The Govern-&#xD;
ment was amazed An'd cmba-rassed by the&#xD;
swarming multitudes that hurried to the nation-&#xD;
al standard at the fidt blast of the'bugle. The&#xD;
despotisms of the Old World, that had, at the&#xD;
beginning, laughed at our calamity and mocked&#xD;
when our trial carme, wondered beyond measure&#xD;
at the spectacle of a mighty army, gathered in&#xD;
a day, ba 'power inherent in itself, stimulated&#xD;
neither by hope of pillage nor love of conflict,&#xD;
but by pure patriotism.&#xD;
This geat 'Army of the North and West rest*&#xD;
ed quietly on the Potomac, awaiting calmly the&#xD;
shock of battle. General Scott, strong in his&#xD;
integrity, faithful to the Union.and 'his soldier-&#xD;
instincts, ian consonanc with his carefully-&#xD;
studied plan of the campaign, was now drawing&#xD;
his strong cordons more closely. around the&#xD;
black hearti f Rebellion.&#xD;
The rebeis'affteted to behold these vast prep&#xD;
rations with 'ontempt.   Intrenched behind&#xD;
masked batteries, they raised and strtik the&#xD;
*ar-post, boAsti of their achievements in tlh&#xD;
past, And' vain -gloriuisly breathiog speedy de&#xD;
feat to the barbarian Yankee hordes. But noth-&#xD;
ing came of the semenaces; and Washington, in-&#xD;
stead of becoming a "stone quarry," as threat-&#xD;
ened by the potential leader of'the Couf derate&#xD;
forces, wa unusually gay an  attractive. In&#xD;
the various 'skirmishes that took place, the&#xD;
Southern' chivalry showed more haste then h-&#xD;

&#xD;
roism. Indeed, their legs were their best arms,&#xD;
the former taking them from that danger which&#xD;
the latter could not, or would not,. manfully&#xD;
meet.&#xD;
The rebels occupied Fairfax and Manassas,&#xD;
and an advance upon those places was talked&#xD;
of by those in authority, greatly to the satisfac-&#xD;
tion of the loyal troops. The retreat of the en-&#xD;
emy had been so uniform that many dreamed&#xD;
of an easy victory ; but there were cooler per-&#xD;
sons who shook their heads, and talked of Gates&#xD;
flying before the charging squadrons of Corn-&#xD;
wallis at the disastrous field of Camden.&#xD;
Weary of inaction and iheited by an earnest&#xD;
but over-zealous press, the Army of the Poto-'&#xD;
mac was impatient for a decisive forward move-&#xD;
ment. Such was the situa ion of affairs at the&#xD;
time our story commences.&#xD;
Late on a soft and pleasant summer-night,&#xD;
some weeks after the magnificent moonlight-&#xD;
march over the Long Bridge, and the occupa-&#xD;
tion of Alexandrianby the dashing Fire Brigade,&#xD;
s man, mounted on a powerful horse, was ob-&#xD;
served by two of the loyal pickets slowly ad-&#xD;
vancing in the direction of Fairfax, unconscious,&#xD;
apparently,'that he w4 ear those whose duty&#xD;
it was to demand his business and dispute his&#xD;
right to proceed, unless duly vouched for by a&#xD;
military pass. The pickets, on making this&#xD;
discovery, drew closer to each other, andscreen-&#xD;
ed by a cluster of intervening bushes, quietly&#xD;
awaited the horseman's coming. When he was&#xD;
sufficiently near for that purpose, one of the&#xD;
men stepped from his covert,.and demanded :&#xD;
" Who goes ?"                       ,&#xD;
The horseman, instead of answering this chal-&#xD;
lenge in customary form, instantly spurred his&#xD;
horse and made a bold attempt to run the pick-&#xD;
et.  So sudden was this movement, that the&#xD;
guard had neither time to cock nor present his.&#xD;
musket; and had it not been for his .compan-&#xD;
ion, the determined rider would have effected&#xD;
his purpose.  The former, as the latter was&#xD;
passing near his concealment, and, indeed, al-&#xD;
most upon him, had the presence of mind to&#xD;
throw himself forward b-efore the plunging&#xD;
horse, anil seize it by the bridle, with a force&#xD;
and energy that effectually checked the animal,&#xD;
which, however, made a spirited effort to shake&#xD;
him off.&#xD;
The man making this decisive demonstration&#xD;
was tall and athletic, and clad in a plain suit of&#xD;
national blue. While his right hand grasped&#xD;
firmly i1he tightened reins, he held in his left a&#xD;
rifled "musket, surmounted by that terrible&#xD;
weapon, the sabre-bayonet, which, in the soft&#xD;
moonlight, glittered like burnished silver. A&#xD;
heavy dragoon-sword wns girt to his side by a&#xD;
substantial leathern belt, which also gave sup-&#xD;
port to a bowie-knife and a brace of revolvers..&#xD;
His stronglv-defined and sun-browned face&#xD;
was singular calm and unruffled in expres-&#xD;
sion, as he nervously pressed the horse back-&#xD;
&#xD;
ward upon his haunches, and controlled his fier'&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
"Don't hurrystranger,.don't hurry  ,You'll&#xD;
sweat your. lhoss, if, you :ain't keerful. There's&#xD;
time enough for any honest business, without&#xD;
heatin' your blood."&#xD;
The horseman had reached down to the saddle,&#xD;
and half-drawn a pistol; but, on hearing this&#xD;
salutation, let it fall slowly back into the bolster.&#xD;
"My haste is urgent. Do not detain me- I&#xD;
should even now be several miles from here,"&#xD;
he answered, looking umiessily about him.&#xD;
" Nu doubt o 't; bet them   severial miles&#xD;
ought todbe torard Arlington, 'stead o' this way.&#xD;
I'd  ave vou comperhend, impatient stranger,&#xD;
that nowlbat done up in the shape of flesh, be it&#xD;
the flesh of men, women, children, or animals,&#xD;
can budge this way without. the countersign or&#xD;
a written parse. I'll take one or t'other of 'onm&#xD;
about this time of the lone starry hours ; which&#xD;
means, young traveler, about as quick as you&#xD;
can cleverly git at 'enm."&#xD;
The horseman glanced downward at the fea-&#xD;
tures of his interrogator ; they were quiet but&#xD;
determined.&#xD;
"I thought," he said, searching his pockets,&#xD;
" that I passed the loyal pickets half a mile&#xD;
back; but it would seem that I am mistaken. I&#xD;
had a paper," he added, hesitatingly, "from one&#xD;
in authority ; but--but I fear I have lost it."&#xD;
" Sorry to hear it, sir ! - Am  afeard it'll put&#xD;
you to a deal o' trouble., You'll obleege nie by&#xD;
gittin' off o' this hoss. It's a slashing' fine un,&#xD;
and '11 do for the Boys to prac-tise the calvary&#xD;
movements on."&#xD;
4 You surely don't mean to detain and rob&#xD;
me !" cried the horseman, in evident alarm. "I&#xD;
warn you that any violence offered to me will be&#xD;
resisted. Who are you? Call the corporal of&#xD;
the guard !"&#xD;
The man laid his hand again upon a pistol.&#xD;
" To confiscate the. spiles of an inemy, is no&#xD;
robbery. Your resistance I keer nowbat about,&#xD;
inasmuch as fighting' is at present my perfession.&#xD;
As for the next question consarning who I be,&#xD;
my name is Scotto, independent enp'n of an in-&#xD;
dependent company of star-spangled critters. I&#xD;
go for the Union, the whole Union, and constitu-&#xD;
tional liberty. If I don't eat my bigness into&#xD;
rebellion, if I don't cut and back, hash, slash,&#xD;
and gash, right and left, it 'll be because my&#xD;
hand forgets its cunnin', and my arm loses its&#xD;
strength, my heart its patriotism, and my brain&#xD;
its sense ! That's who I be, and that's the ground&#xD;
on which I stan' on, and, with God's help, will&#xD;
stan' on while I stan' anywhere on the nirth.&#xD;
As for the cor'pril of the guard, I'll send for him&#xD;
when I need him. Havin' answered all your&#xD;
questions, I'll take the liberty to help you out&#xD;
of the saddle."&#xD;
Captain Scotto dropped his musket upori the&#xD;
grass at his feet, and was about to drag the&#xD;
young man from his seat, when, making a virtue&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
of necessity, he saved him that trouble by dis-&#xD;
mounting, but not till he had looked at the&#xD;
other guard, and perceived 'his weapon leveled&#xD;
at his head.&#xD;
" Everything you have asked has been replied&#xD;
to by me. It Is now my turn to be inquisitive.&#xD;
What name did you say ?" added Scotto.&#xD;
" In times like these, names are of little con-&#xD;
sequence," responded  the. person interrogated.&#xD;
" however, I have no objections to telling you-&#xD;
a na ne that has never been disgraced by me.&#xD;
I a:n called R tphi Girdwood."&#xD;
"A good nam - and a good bigger by natur',"&#xD;
returned Scotto, appreciatively. .' But names&#xD;
an.l figgers don't pars pickets without the docky-&#xD;
neeits. We've suffered enough by being too&#xD;
easy with our inemies. Our Gov'ment has hard&#xD;
work to b lieve that we're in ait actooal state o'&#xD;
,war with then as will show no marcy. Mistaken&#xD;
kin Ibess has got to stop somewhere ; and as true&#xD;
is m' na:ua is Scotto, it shall go hard with the&#xD;
spy thiat fills mt , my hands."&#xD;
"Spy!" exclaimedl Girdwood, quickly.&#xD;
"Spy I said, and spy it is I" said Scotto,&#xD;
sharply. " Down on t ie grass, mister! Barney&#xD;
Malone "-he turned to. the guard who stood&#xD;
near him -" off with this chip's boots, and see&#xD;
whit's into 'em."%&#xD;
"Jist as your honor plates! If 'twas a leg or&#xD;
an ara that ye'd have pulled off, I'd pull it off&#xD;
all th same; for obajence to orders is the fust&#xD;
'ty of h bold soger boy," responded. Barney,&#xD;
a l;'ancing upon Girdwood, with alacrity.&#xD;
" I protest against this!" exclaimed Girdwood,&#xD;
retreatimg  behind his horse, which Captain&#xD;
Scotto still held. "I warn you not to come&#xD;
lieirer. If I am to be detained, take me to&#xD;
las i-quarters."&#xD;
Ie drew up his person and showed Barneyi&#xD;
donse a figure straight, athletic, and hand-&#xD;
CliC and too formidable to be lightly approach-&#xD;
I.&#xD;
"Is it to Barney Malone ye say it?  Is it to&#xD;
thrue Uion soldier that ye're sp'akin' ?" re-&#xD;
rted Barney, throwing himself into an attitude&#xD;
' defence. " Mind these two illigant bunches&#xD;
'bones, now !" (Barney held up his fists like&#xD;
prize-fighter.) "Down on the grass, as ye're&#xD;
owid, ye murtherin' blackguard !, If 'twasn't&#xD;
or the likes of ye, we might ivery mother's son&#xD;
f us be home, dhr'amin' peaceably in our bussed&#xD;
eds."&#xD;
"Back!" admonished Girdwood. "Back!"&#xD;
: Barney not heeding this warning, but con-&#xD;
inning to press upon the young man, the latter&#xD;
truck straight out from the shoulder and&#xD;
nocked him down ; then, with singular celerity&#xD;
f motion, sprang upon his horse, plunged his&#xD;
purs mio his sides, and riding over Scotto,&#xD;
t'le good his escape.&#xD;
'hye captain seized his musket and fired after&#xD;
he daring horseman. The report was followed&#xD;
quick succession by several others along the&#xD;
&#xD;
I,.&#xD;
&#xD;
line, but Ralph Girdwood rode on, apparently&#xD;
unharmed.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
TE INDEPENDENT RANGERS AND THE DASKETEEU.&#xD;
Scott, gazed after Ralph Girdwood til both&#xD;
horse and rider had dwindled into a iure egeek&#xD;
in the distance.&#xD;
" There lie goes, driving' full speed into the&#xD;
inemy's picket V he muttered, in a i one that suf-&#xD;
ficiently evidenced his dissatisfaction. - Tisn't&#xD;
often 1 git fooled in that way. Lubin' what few&#xD;
fakilties I had, I guess. The twins could done&#xD;
better'n that. \ ll, it's been the way from the&#xD;
begiain'; the seceshers, spies, lirates, and&#xD;
Uion-killers have escaped their desarta. Them&#xD;
as should a been hung, by the head; or shut by&#xD;
a squad o' men at thirteen paces, shirk the&#xD;
awards o' justice in one way or another ; ey; her&#xD;
by the tender mareies of the Gov'nieit, their&#xD;
wit, or their heels. I wonder which this ting 'l11&#xD;
stop? I wonder when the wise uns at Washia'-&#xD;
ton. 'll begin to work in airnest :: I wonder&#xD;
when the dull eyes '11 be opened, the heavy ears&#xD;
begin to hear, and the inactive han-is put forth&#xD;
their strength. For one, I want to fight! For&#xD;
one, I want to 'eat my bigness into this rebel-&#xD;
lion! For one, I want to draw the sword o'&#xD;
Liberty, and hack, hash, and gash for th.. Con-&#xD;
tinental Constitution, which is the hope o' thie'&#xD;
world, and which we've lived under happy and&#xD;
contented' till this rotten secesher idee was&#xD;
dinned into the ears of the South-downers-by a&#xD;
few lazy, pervaricatin', pervarted dimagogues,&#xD;
grasping' arter rule and authority. That's the&#xD;
short, long, and whole on't 1"&#xD;
Scotto looked thoughtfully at the bright sa-&#xD;
bre-bayonet on his musket, sighed, and turned&#xD;
slowly to Barney Malone&#xD;
"Up, Barney, up! Never fall down, man,&#xD;
when a traitor strikes."&#xD;
"-Niver fall;is it? cried Barney, springing&#xD;
to his feet. ' ";Kape0'ur trotters when you're&#xD;
knocked down, you mane ? Stan' up when you're&#xD;
sprawlin', wud ye ?  Cap'n, jewel, they it your-&#xD;
self, and jest be afther informin' ine how it&#xD;
agrays wid fe, immejiate aftherwards. His fist&#xD;
flew outLlike a stame-hammier straight into me&#xD;
countenance when all to onet, without any warn-&#xD;
in', something' drapped at me feet; an) meself&#xD;
was it that drapped. Bad cess to the murdering'&#xD;
seeader! He's spied the sittin' of na illigant an&#xD;
eye as iver sighted a gun-barrel, or winked at&#xD;
an angel. May gunpowther and lead bring me&#xD;
to grafe if I don't remimber this'insult when we&#xD;
reach Melasees Gap; Feerfax.Coort-House, and&#xD;
other ribil intrenehments. The Sixty-ninth is&#xD;
the boys for 'em! The Sixty-ninth is the eye-&#xD;
wathier for me!I"&#xD;
Barney resumed his musket, and seemed lost&#xD;
in a sudden reverie of the Sixty-ninth.&#xD;
Will they fight?", asked Scotto, look'mg&#xD;
again at the lessening form of the horseman.&#xD;

" Is it of Paddy Malone ye axes it?  Is it me-&#xD;
self that ye're s. aiun' to? Isn't it some dirthy&#xD;
drame you're in, cap'n dear? Will cats ketcnh&#xD;
mice?   Will lislies swim the say?  Will fer-&#xD;
rets run afther rats? Go away wid ye, Cap'n&#xD;
eotto !"&#xD;
Barney made a playful thrust at Scotto with&#xD;
his bayonet; but it was evident that the ques-&#xD;
tion hind touched him in a sensitive spot.&#xD;
"I'mi sorry,''said Scotto, with a troubled face,&#xD;
" that the chap got away. I thought you could&#xD;
manage him, Barneyy, or I should laid hands on&#xD;
him inyself. I shouldn't wonder now, if there&#xD;
was plans of our works in his boots. He wouldn't&#xD;
slipped through the fingers of one o' then Fire&#xD;
Zarves in that way, I'll warrant."&#xD;
"It's, the rid-capped divils you're comparin'&#xD;
me wid ! I'll tell ye jest the truth, eap'n ; the&#xD;
fire eraythers are good for contindin' with fire&#xD;
and rather, but wud go down afore a stame-&#xD;
hammer as suddint as Barney Malone of the&#xD;
Sixty-ninth. Take part of the blame to your-&#xD;
self. )idn't a fine horse flout ye at the same&#xD;
time? Why didn't ye liould him, cap'n ? Tell&#xD;
me that que tion, I axes ye " S     w&#xD;
Barney leered cunningly at Scotto, who was&#xD;
now very willing to drop the subject, and, for-&#xD;
tunately for him, the appearance of a body of&#xD;
horsemen favored his wishes.&#xD;
"Here comes my star-spangled     critters !&#xD;
You'll hear from them, Barney, afore this on-&#xD;
nat'ral war is over. There isn't one on 'em but&#xD;
is able to eat his bigness into rebellion. They're&#xD;
true men, gathered from all parts of the North&#xD;
and West. They've seen all sorts o' sarvice,&#xD;
and love the Union as they do their mothers.&#xD;
They're boys arter myown heart! For liberty&#xD;
and the nation, they'll hack, and out, and slice,&#xD;
with the bravest fighters in the land. Not that&#xD;
they nat'rally love blood and slaughter. Not&#xD;
that, by no means whatsomever. In civil life&#xD;
they're as tender-hearted ahp women, and indus-&#xD;
trious as ants. But the sperrit of Seventy-Six is&#xD;
irnto 'em! The patriotism of the fightin' fathers&#xD;
swells in their bosoms like new wine in bottles.&#xD;
No plunder, no filthy-lucre, no pay for the In-&#xD;
dependent Union Rangers. They're in nobody's&#xD;
sarvice but the country's ; under nobody's com-&#xD;
mand in particular brit mine ; in for no time, but&#xD;
for the war, long or short. We ask nothin' of&#xD;
Government but the priver'lege of begin' put' face&#xD;
to face with the foe. We want io clothes, no&#xD;
quipments, no houses, no rations, no money out&#xD;
, ncle Sam. We can take keer of ourselves,&#xD;
and do it chebrful, all' for the sake of the glori-&#xD;
ous old Stars and Stripes that our ancestors&#xD;
fou ht udder at Bunker Hill, Lexington, Con-&#xD;
oor , and other places. It's a fine old rag," he&#xD;
added, casting his eyes upward to the flag that&#xD;
floated over Iis command. " It's a fine old rag,&#xD;
and woe, woe to the traitors that betray it !"&#xD;
Perhaps the patriotic Scotto thought of a&#xD;
white-headed ol man, once known in America&#xD;
&#xD;
as 'General Twiggs, but remicmbcred now only&#xD;
for the.enormity of his treason.&#xD;
By this time the Union Rangers had drawn&#xD;
up before their leader. This company of index.&#xD;
pendent men was-composed of the best material&#xD;
for hard and efficient service. They numbered&#xD;
a hundred and ten, including officers, and had&#xD;
rallied around Scotto because he had seen serv-&#xD;
ice in Mexico, and in the wild warfare of the&#xD;
West. They knew that he would not flinch, ant&#xD;
was the man to lead them to victory, if it were&#xD;
within human attainment. his hardy frame, well-&#xD;
seasoned muscles, and, universally-accredited&#xD;
courage, gave promise of great effectiveness ;&#xD;
while his unquestioned loyalty and many good&#xD;
qualities, secured the respect and friendship of&#xD;
his followers.&#xD;
: "Lieutenant Scarlett," said Scotto, "have you&#xD;
seen anybody stirring' within our lines?"&#xD;
"Only a man on horseback, who might, for&#xD;
aught 1 know, have been one of our pickets.&#xD;
Seeing us, he quickened his speed, and we soon&#xD;
lost sight of him. . He should have reached.the&#xD;
picket somewhere hereabout," replied the officer&#xD;
} addressed,&#xD;
" He did reach it, and run it, too !" returned&#xD;
Scotto, biting his lip, " He's a good two mile&#xD;
on his way to Fairfax, by this time."&#xD;
"A detachment of the-Black Horse Cavalry&#xD;
has been popping at our pickets a"few miles&#xD;
above," remarked the lieutenant, looking in-&#xD;
quisitively at the face of his leader.&#xD;
" The Black Hoes Calvary 1" repeated Scotto,&#xD;
quickly. " We must have a dash at them, boys.&#xD;
Black losses or white losses don't make no dif-&#xD;
ference in a man's fighting' qualities. The black&#xD;
hoss idee 'nay scare children, but it won't go&#xD;
down with our Northers and Westers that are&#xD;
big enough to buckle on a sword, or sight a rifle.&#xD;
There's nothin' in color, but everything in&#xD;
pluck. We'll move out our lads, and make a&#xD;
reconnoisance ,,torard  the  inemy's advance-&#xD;
guard."&#xD;
At that moment a man spurred from the rear&#xD;
in considerable haste, and, approaching Captain&#xD;
Scotto, said, with a scandalized look :&#xD;
" Them twins are fighting' ag'in !"&#xD;
" Fightin' ag'in ? -rIn course they're fightin'&#xD;
again. They're callers fightiri' ag'in," returned&#xD;
Scotto. Then raising his voice, ie shouted&#xD;
"Peleg ! Pickerin'!- ro the front, you littler. s.&#xD;
calls !"&#xD;
After some delay and commotion in the rear&#xD;
rank, two boys, about a dozen years old, -dress-&#xD;
ed as Zouaves, mounted on mules, made their&#xD;
appearance in front. They were somewhat dis-&#xD;
ordered and blown, evidently from a recent&#xD;
brush.&#xD;
"Been at it ag'in-haven't ye ?" queried Scot;r s&#xD;
without a particle of apparent wrath.&#xD;
One of. the lads grinned, the other looked sni.&#xD;
len.&#xD;
" Clapperelawin' each other, weren't th y&#xD;
&#xD;
Oo'.'ril Keith ?".turning to the man who had&#xD;
preferred the charge against the culprits.&#xD;
" They was ! They was at it, peggin' away at&#xD;
each other arter the old fashion," replied Cor-.&#xD;
poral Keith. -&#xD;
"it's into 'em ! It's nat'rally into 'em, and&#xD;
has been into'em ever since I found 'em a'hang-&#xD;
in' in a basket at my door. Prehaps you all,&#xD;
may or may'nt know," he continued, looking at&#xD;
his command, " that that was the way that I&#xD;
oome into the possession of them belligerents.-&#xD;
Yea, my men, then critters was in a basket,,&#xD;
done up in some coarse sackin', with never so&#xD;
much linen on 'em as would kiver a pin-cushion.&#xD;
Tiey was very new babies. They was too new.&#xD;
to be balloon' in a basket. I was a single man&#xD;
then, as I am now, and as I'm like to be through&#xD;
life ; and knew no more about new babies than&#xD;
a Thomas-eat about kittens. . I was a good 'cal&#xD;
exercised in my feelin's. I thought, at fust, that&#xD;
I'd slip 'em slyly aboard the fust stage-coach&#xD;
that passed along the rad, and send 'em, sackin'&#xD;
and all, to seek their fortins otherwheres. But&#xD;
fafe ordered things different, for jest then they,&#xD;
begun to claw each other and scream. Their&#xD;
cries went through my ears like the shriek of a&#xD;
ie. While- I stood staring , onsartin what to do,.&#xD;
my housekeeper, an old maid aunt, come out of&#xD;
a suddint.  When she seed that basket, she&#xD;
bristle.l up like a porkypine, and looked at me&#xD;
awful.&#xD;
What's into it?' sez shea&#xD;
"'Reg'lar live uns!' sea I, edgin' away. ,&#xD;
Luke Scotto, you're a depravity !' sez she.&#xD;
Who'd a thought a respectable house would a&#xD;
had. babies hung onto it!'&#xD;
"'Nobody, I guess, that's acquainted here-&#xD;
abouts.' sez I, maliciously.  With that she toss-&#xD;
ed her head and went in, leavin' the basket on&#xD;
the door-step. But she didn't stay long. There&#xD;
was a woman's heah into her, notwithstanding'&#xD;
her sharpness. She come back ag'in and told&#xD;
me to fetch in the basket."&#xD;
"Were they twins ?" asked   the lieutenant,&#xD;
smiling.'&#xD;
The Lord he only knows !  They was about.&#xD;
thie same length and bigness.  Their featur's&#xD;
was as onlike as two hIindu idols, and they fou't&#xD;
each other; tieerfore we thought.it best to call&#xD;
'em twins ; though I ginerally styles 'em the&#xD;
Basketeers. Individooally, they're named Peleg&#xD;
and 'Piekerin'. Like many other brethers-tak-&#xD;
in' it for granted they're brethers-they don't&#xD;
agree. There is a tendency -into 'em to pitch in.&#xD;
There hasn't been a day simee I brung 'em up,&#xD;
that they haven't pitcher in, more or less, often-&#xD;
er more.-I reckia they come of a fightin' fam-&#xD;
ily, and these be the instincts of the second and&#xD;
third ginerations."&#xD;
Seotto paused, and various comments were'&#xD;
ade by the Rangers, some of which were by&#xD;
*o means flattering to the subjects of this short;&#xD;
story.z&#xD;
&#xD;
" There being' so much tight in 'em," re&#xD;
sumed the captain, "I'm goin' to turn it to sarmo&#xD;
account. If they'll.tackle the inemy with half&#xD;
the spirit they do each other, they'll do mis-&#xD;
chief. There's been a good 'cal of our'ousty&#xD;
and 'quir'y, and some innooendo about 'those&#xD;
boys, and I've taken this occasion to set ye all&#xD;
right. They're fo'ndlin's. There no more nor&#xD;
less than basket fo'ndlin's. Co'p'ril Keith"--he.&#xD;
turned.to the corporal--'t if they git to fighting'&#xD;
ag'iu, let me know it. , Boys, fall back to your&#xD;
places I"&#xD;
The Basketeers, in obeying this order, pur-&#xD;
posely backed their mules together, which fell&#xD;
to kicking furiously, to the great delight of their&#xD;
riders, who clung to their backs like monkeys.&#xD;
" The mules are twins, too, I allow !" said&#xD;
Corporal Keith.&#xD;
Peleg and Pickering finally effected a retreat.&#xD;
creating confusion in whatever direction thee&#xD;
went. One was presently heard singing "'Dixie,&#xD;
and the other "John Brown."&#xD;
" Attention !  Now, my star-spangled orit.&#xD;
terms, we'll look arter driftin' squads of the Black&#xD;
Hoss Calvary. Right face 1. File left I Marchl"&#xD;
Previously to giving this order, Captain Soot&#xD;
to mounted his horse, which had been tied to a&#xD;
tree near by, and which Barney led forward.&#xD;
The UnionRangers moved off at a lively&#xD;
pace, the fighting brothers cantering in the rest.&#xD;
their red caps and red trowsers rendering then&#xD;
conspicuous long after Scotto's columns presea4-&#xD;
ed but a dark mass.&#xD;
" The blissings of God and all the saints that&#xD;
iver was, go with 'em, and with the ould flag&#xD;
that floats over 'em !" said Barney Malone, fer-&#xD;
vently, as he renewed his rounds. "Bad look&#xD;
to the Irishman that won't fight for the Stars'&#xD;
and Stripes, and the country that gives hiua&#xD;
bread and butther, and more liberty nor he glia&#xD;
at home.' The Sixty-ninth is the boys for 'en,&#xD;
say I!"&#xD;
'Ihrinking of he Sixty-ninth, Barney stepped&#xD;
off more firmly, and, held up his head bravely,.&#xD;
At the moment when the Rangers swept out oaf.&#xD;
sight, he was singing, sturdily:&#xD;
" with my sprig of shillalah and shamrock as gress."&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THZ CAPTAIN OF TER BLACK HORS.&#xD;
Meantime, the man who had so successfully&#xD;
passed the loyal picket, kept on his way, unin-&#xD;
jured by the bullets that whistled. after him.&#xD;
One of 'these leaden messengers pierced his eap.&#xD;
doing, fortunately, no further damage than oar-.&#xD;
rying away a lock of hair,&#xD;
" Close shooting for night practice!"' he mut-&#xD;
tered. "I'll warrant yonder stout Yankee cap.&#xD;
tain aimed that missile. -I wonder what is tobe&#xD;
the end of all this ?"&#xD;
Ralph Girdwood fell into-a fit of musing, and,&#xD;
being out of rifle range, allowed his horse to&#xD;
slacken its speed. He had proceeded but a short&#xD;

The two now continued their way, in nearly&#xD;
unbroken silence. Putting their horses to a&#xD;
gallop, they passed Centreville. Girdwood had&#xD;
yet seen nothing i o inpre-s him with the&#xD;
strength of the Confederates, whose 'cause he,&#xD;
seemed ready to espouse. Indeed, he had ob-&#xD;
served little else than a few feeble, and, obvious-&#xD;
ly, hastily-constructed intrenehments, mounted&#xD;
by three or four six-pound howitzers. Centre-&#xD;
ville was in no state of defence. There were&#xD;
men there in considerable force, but without the&#xD;
means of making an efficient stand. Ralph&#xD;
could not forbear expressing astonishment.&#xD;
A grim smile--the first he had seen upon his,&#xD;
sonibre visage-appeared a moment upon ilur-&#xD;
dlestone's lips.&#xD;
" We have no daily press to betray us," he&#xD;
said, quickly, and with an .energetic gesture.&#xD;
" General Beauregard ties up the tongues of&#xD;
fools and the necks of knaves. But blabbing&#xD;
folly reigns supreme and rampant in the camp&#xD;
of our enemies.  We know when they buy&#xD;
a battery, and where they place it. We know&#xD;
when they contemplate a muov. meat, and when&#xD;
it takes place. The Northern press tells us&#xD;
their weak places, their poor generals, and, in&#xD;
shdrt, their doubts, fears, and expectations. We&#xD;
have spies and emissaries, friends and sympa-,&#xD;
thizers in all the departments at Washington.&#xD;
We will conquer the Federals as much by se-&#xD;
cret agents and cabal, as by the swo-d and&#xD;
mas ed batteries."&#xD;
ITe stretched out his gauntleted hand, and,&#xD;
laying it suddenly on Girdwood's arm, added, in&#xD;
a raised and exultant voice :&#xD;
" The fatal mistake of the Federals is, that&#xD;
they cannot believe themselves seriously at war,&#xD;
ant play the magnanin'ous while we are masking&#xD;
batteries, and playing the devil with the Union,&#xD;
I tell you, sir, that war is a terrible giant, with'&#xD;
iron remorsless fingers, and no May-day queen,&#xD;
to be decked with wreaths and crowned with&#xD;
laurel I"&#xD;
"true-most true !" said Girdwood, so fer-&#xD;
vently, that Hurdlestone fancied he had fired&#xD;
him with his own dark enthusiasm.&#xD;
Sentry after sentry was passed, to each of&#xD;
hom IIurdlestone seemed well known.&#xD;
" What roal is this ?" asked Girdwood.&#xD;
" The Warrenton Road, over which the Fed-&#xD;
erals will march to Manassas !" replied Hurdle-&#xD;
stone, shrugging his shoulders.&#xD;
"' ihat ravine and -vood is this, stretching&#xD;
away before us ?'' queried the young man, gaz-&#xD;
im  through the moonlit-mists of night, at the&#xD;

&#xD;
with a peculiar lighting up of his eyes, " where&#xD;
the Federal troops will stop to reuri sih thin-&#xD;
selves in the cooling shades, when wear'v of their&#xD;
'tramp down from Arlington. previous to their&#xD;
triumphal entry into lanassas."&#xD;
Hurdlestone lifted his shoulders again, and a&#xD;
grim ghost of a smile appeared to give a amen-&#xD;
ing to his face that Ralph could not fathom.&#xD;
In truth, he was becoming every monument more&#xD;
mystified with the rider of the black horse.&#xD;
He was, clearly, a man -of strong prjumdices,&#xD;
deep and ever-consuming passions, of m charac-&#xD;
ter bold, resolute, and -unshrminkmg, and mex-&#xD;
orably wedded to a purpose, disposed, like&#xD;
inany others, to hold the prowess o his enemies&#xD;
in contempt.&#xD;
" This position is a strong-one, by 'nature,"&#xD;
Ralph remarked.&#xD;
"You tell me no news, young man." "answer-&#xD;
ed Hurdlestone, turning from  the mamnrond&#xD;
into a well-trodden path. Crossiby a ef rods&#xD;
of rolling table-lamid, green with folige, they&#xD;
reached, anon, a spot remarkable for its quiet&#xD;
and secluded beauty.  I[ree s peenlinr to the&#xD;
soft and luxurious climate grew there in native&#xD;
perfection.' Here were more sentinils, with&#xD;
whom the Confederate officer cornamunicated in&#xD;
low tones, and passed on.&#xD;
A ride of twenty rods through the trees look&#xD;
them to a neat f'rrni-iouse, near which, on the&#xD;
crass, in the row Waning moonlight, several&#xD;
blacks were sleeping.&#xD;
"Haimon ! Dagon !" said lurdlestone, slymarp-&#xD;
ly. " This way, lazy fellows, and tale th. se&#xD;
horses."  Then to Ralph :   " Dismount, sir.&#xD;
Here our journey ends."&#xD;
Two of the blacks arose slowly from the soft,&#xD;
green pillow of Nature, and, after rubbing their&#xD;
heavy eyes an instant, came briskly forward and&#xD;
took charge of the hor-es, favoring Girdwood&#xD;
with many inquisitive glances as they led the&#xD;
animals away.&#xD;

deportment. le led the way through an open&#xD;
piazza, followed by Girdwood. Opening a door&#xD;
at his right, Hurdlestone entered an apartment&#xD;
on the first floor, in which a lamp was dimly&#xD;
burning. The same air of neatness that had iun&#xD;
pressed him without, was apparent within, But&#xD;
Ralph, as it happened, had no time for general&#xD;
observation. A feminine figure, arising suddenly&#xD;
from the obscure background, approached the&#xD;
Confederate officer with quick steps and cut-&#xD;
stretched hands, crying :&#xD;

14        SCOTTO, THE SCOUT ; OR, THE UNION RANGERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
" If I am to appear before ladies, my toilet is&#xD;
scarcely presentable," said Ralph,, glancing at&#xD;
his travel-worn garments.&#xD;
" These are times not to be over-particular.&#xD;
It is not the outside that shouldeommend you&#xD;
to tIe favorable regards of Southern dames and&#xD;
damsels. You will see none of the gentler sort,&#xD;
save my 'daughter.",&#xD;
These words were not uttered with, that gra-&#xD;
ciousness which Ralph believed he had a right&#xD;
to expect as a guest. Entering the roam to&#xD;
which he had been conducted a few hours before,&#xD;
he looked for Hope and the person whom Hur-&#xD;
dlestone had mentioned. Neither were visible.&#xD;
A table was spread in a neat and inviting man-&#xD;
ner, and two black servants stood waiting for&#xD;
ord'ei-s. A momn;nt after,'Miss Hurdlestone ap-&#xD;
peared, and, greeting Girdwood in a friendly&#xD;
manner, seated herself, behind the cofftee-urn.&#xD;
Almost simultaneously, from' another door, a&#xD;
man walked gravely in.&#xD;
"Doctor Benedict, this is Mr. Girdwood, re-&#xD;
eentl from Baltimore, through Washington and&#xD;
the Federal lines."'&#xD;
The man bowed slightly to Ralph, and took&#xD;
the seat to which his host pointed. The young&#xD;
man, sitting opposite to Doctor Benedict, was&#xD;
impressed by his person and manners. . He was&#xD;
slight in form, but compact in the economy of&#xD;
muscle. Strength seemed combined with the&#xD;
most skillful disposition bf material, so that the&#xD;
whole structure should possess the greatest ef-&#xD;
ficiency compatible with the per-centage of&#xD;
weight. His features were regular, with a strong&#xD;
Anglo-Saxon cast, and a noticeable firmness&#xD;
about the mouth and p prying quickness of the&#xD;
eyes. His hair was somewhat gray.' The upper&#xD;
lip was covered with a moustache. He wore a&#xD;
plain military coat.'&#xD;
The commencement of the meal was some-&#xD;
what stiff; but presently Doctor Benedict began&#xD;
to talk, and the constraint gradually wore off.&#xD;
"What do-the people of Washington think of&#xD;
this rebellion, Mr. Girdwood ?" he asked, sipping&#xD;
his coffee, leisurely.&#xD;
Just then Ralph saw Hope Hurdlestone look at&#xD;
him. It struck him that her eyes warned him&#xD;
of danger; at' least- he so construed their lan-&#xD;
guage.&#xD;
" There are many minds at Washington,''' an-&#xD;
swered Ralph, guardedly. "The President and&#xD;
Cabinet feel assured that the Union will be pre-&#xD;
served, and the rebellion crushed. There are&#xD;
others who predict, with equal confidence, that&#xD;
&amp;amp;e seceded States will never returnito their alp&#xD;
legianee."_&#xD;
" And what do you think ?"&#xD;
The eyes of Doctor Benedict were now lifted&#xD;
full upon Girdwood, who fancied they beamed&#xD;
with a wild and ambitious light. Before he re-&#xD;
lied to this home-question, he glanced at MisI&#xD;
iurdlestone, and  1w the same warning lan-'&#xD;
guage in her face.&#xD;
&#xD;
" My opinion," he said, discreetly,' "can be&#xD;
worth little to persons of more years and expe-&#xD;
rience than, myself. I will say this, however,&#xD;
the South underrates the power of the North."&#xD;
"How many men has General Scott within a&#xD;
day's march of Washington ?" continued Doctor&#xD;
Benedict, deliberately.&#xD;
"A   hundred thousand,"  answered Ralph,&#xD;
promptly.&#xD;
" It's false I" exclaimed Hurdlestone, angrily.&#xD;
" Patience, patience, Colonel Hurdlestone ! I&#xD;
think the young man is right," said Benedict,&#xD;
with easy self-possession.&#xD;
" Pardon me, sir. You have mistaken my&#xD;
rank. I am simply a captain in the Black&#xD;
Horse," responded Hurdlestone, pettishly..&#xD;
" Nay, my friend, itis you who are mistaken.&#xD;
You were a captain-yesterday ; but you are a&#xD;
colonel to-day. I have it from good authority."&#xD;
DoctorBenedict held up a hot roll in his white&#xD;
hand, and looked tranquilly at his host, who for&#xD;
a moment wasconfused.&#xD;
" My blunder, I trust, is pardonable, doctor,&#xD;
if you bear in mind the circumstance that I have&#xD;
been absent more than twenty-four hours. The&#xD;
general has,.no doubt, judged my ability by my&#xD;
zeal, and, thereby, done me too much honor.&#xD;
On him be the consequences of my inefficiency."&#xD;
.IHurdlestone's voice had its usual hardness ;&#xD;
but even his stern visage could not conceal his&#xD;
inward satisfaction.&#xD;
" A responsibility lie will readily accept, no&#xD;
doubt," said the doctor. "How is Baltimore,&#xD;
Mr. Girdwood ?"&#xD;
" Under the heel of the Unio.n. The guns of&#xD;
Fort -eMHenry are turned upon. that devoted&#xD;
city, and at the first rising of the people it will&#xD;
be laid in.ashes," responded Ralph.&#xD;
"I like not such talk," said the colonel.&#xD;
" The truth," interposed Doctor Benedict, "is&#xD;
always better than falsehood. Baltimore, in-&#xD;
deed, lies panting at the feet of the North ; but&#xD;
when the grand army of the South moves for-&#xD;
ward, her shackles shall be broken."&#xD;
Ralph looked up from his coffee, and per-&#xD;
ceived that the'speaker's face was flushed with&#xD;
eome strong feeling that was at work within him.&#xD;
" Will they bring down those pct lambs of&#xD;
Wilson's ?" he continued.&#xD;
' I see, sir, that you have fallen into the com-&#xD;
mon error concerningthe ' pet lambs,' so called.&#xD;
Wilson's Zonaves are not in th-e Gran I Ariy of&#xD;
.the Potomac, nor have they been there. By&#xD;

.Ralph.&#xD;
" That, cannot be, sir !" exclaimed Hurdle-&#xD;
stone. ."I have seen the led-capped ruffians&#xD;

" Pardon me, colonel! You saw Ellsworth's&#xD;

"I give you my word of honor," -replied&#xD;
Ralph, earnestly, that such a rallying-cry was&#xD;
never heard within the Federal lines."&#xD;
"I have never believed it for a'moment I"&#xD;
said Hope, with suffused face.  .&#xD;
" Traitor!" snarled Hurdlestone. But wheth-&#xD;
er he meant Hope -or Girdwood, was not quite&#xD;
apparent. "Dagon !" he added.&#xD;
"Here mass colonel !" answered the black,&#xD;
promptly.&#xD;
"Do you know whatthe abolitionists are try-&#xD;
ing to do?"&#xD;
"Yes, massa. Dey's coming' down to play de&#xD;

"What are the-New York Fire Zouaves, Da-&#xD;

" Bress you, mass colonel, dey's de debbil&#xD;
hisself! I's tole, yes'day, dey eat de little nigs&#xD;
fast 's dey can cotch 'em, and make nottin''t all&#xD;
ob it. Begins to be steered, I doess"&#xD;
While Dagon stood winking and blinking be-&#xD;
hind his master's chair; a great deal cast down&#xD;
in view of the calamities hanging over the curly&#xD;
heads of the juvenile blacks, the colonel's cate-&#xD;
ehising was brought to an abrupt termination&#xD;
by the hurried tread of feet, and the sudden en-&#xD;
tr.ince of armed men with a prisoner, with his&#xD;
hands tied behind him, pushed forward by bay-.&#xD;
onets and swords. .-&#xD;
The surprise of Girdwood was not slight in&#xD;
recognizing in the luckless captive Captain&#xD;
Scotto, the tall and muscular Federal whom he&#xD;
had encountered the night before on the line of&#xD;
the Union pickets..&#xD;
The eyes of the prisoner, after wandering-&#xD;
around tihe room a moment, fell upon Ralph.&#xD;
" We've met afore, I reckin ?" said Scotto.&#xD;
" You's under a cloud, then'; sy turn now."&#xD;
" Do you know this - man ?" asked. Doctor&#xD;
Benedict, turning sharply to-Ralph.&#xD;
." I narrowly escaped his: bullet last 'night ;&#xD;
but I bear no hardness. He- had me fairly at&#xD;
his mercy, for a short time ; but, thanks to a&#xD;
quick hand and eye, and a good horse, I made&#xD;
ny escape."&#xD;
" It was harnsonely done, if you be a p'ison-&#xD;
ed Secesher !" said Scotto, planting his foot in&#xD;
the stomach of a soldier who 'had goaded hoim&#xD;
heyond endurance. The fellow fell upon his&#xD;
&#xD;
'back, with his gun across him, in a very gro-&#xD;
tesque fashion. " Lay there, .you, mean critter!&#xD;
Can't you let a man alone Ven you've got him&#xD;
snug and fast? A brave man don't exult-over&#xD;
his inemy when he's got the better of him. If&#xD;
I only had my hands untied, I'd make sickness&#xD;
for some of ye !'&#xD;
Scotto looked at his captors threateningly.&#xD;
" Tell ye what ! some of you Black Hoss&#xD;
riptiles'll lose the number of your mess, if you&#xD;
ain't a leetle keerful. I've got a handful of cal-&#xD;
vary myself, that have got some'at to say about&#xD;

nearest tree, if you want to;^but that won't ex-&#xD;
tarminate the'Independent Rangers. I did want&#xD;
to live the year out, that I might eat my big-&#xD;
ness into this rotten rebellion ; theft I might&#xD;
hack, hew, and sloew; that I might see. the ,old&#xD;
flag take the place of the new secession rag i&#xD;
But, if I can't fight, I car hang, or knock under&#xD;
in any way whatsornever you may light on."&#xD;
Scotto drew himself up very straight, and&#xD;
flashed on his enemies bravely.&#xD;
" What is your name ?" asked Doctor Bene-&#xD;
dict.&#xD;
"Scotto," answered the captain, with honest&#xD;
boldness.&#xD;
" Scotto, the Scout !" exclaimed IHurdlestone.&#xD;
" You rebels may have called me so, fust or&#xD;
last. I'd rather be Scotto, the Scout, than&#xD;
Beauregard, the Traitor !" retorted the prison-&#xD;
er, fearlessly.&#xD;
" Up with him, boys of the Black Horse !"&#xD;
cried l1urdlestone. "You'll find a tree hard&#xD;
" I think I've heerd that voice afore. Ain't&#xD;
you one of the shovelry that run away, at Phil-&#xD;
lippi ? I's in that bit of a scrimmage myself,"&#xD;
said Scotto,'coolly.&#xD;
Hurdlestone scowled, and bit his lip.&#xD;
The soldiers began to drag him away.&#xD;
" Stay I" said Benedict, in a voice of authori-&#xD;
ty. "I always like to have a hand in hanging&#xD;
and such things. I wish to question this Yan-&#xD;
kee. Fall back !"&#xD;
The men fell bsck to the door, leaving Seetto&#xD;
in the open ,paee between them and the table.&#xD;
" I breathe better," he said. "This rebel&#xD;
air isn't good for Northern lkngs."&#xD;
"Are you willing to take the oath of allegiance,&#xD;
sir ?" asked' Doctor Benedict, whose sharp, im-&#xD;
perative manner somewhat perplexed Girdwood.&#xD;
"I 'can't talk,' gineral, or cap'n, or whatsomev-&#xD;
er you may be, with strings-onto me," answered&#xD;
Scotto "'If you think its. oncommon danger-&#xD;

" Untie him," said Doctor Benedict.&#xD;
One of the soldiers obeyed, with singular&#xD;
alaclity and .ilenee. Girdwood marveled that&#xD;

arms. " That's more like life, liberty, and the&#xD;

"Now, sir, fire away.!"   .&#xD;
"iWill you take the oath ?" asked Benedict,&#xD;
somewhat moodily.&#xD;
" The which ?"&#xD;
"The oath of allegiance."&#xD;
"Allegiance to what $" asked Scotto, tartly.&#xD;
"To the Southern Confederacy "&#xD;
"Afore. God, I know of no sich institution !&#xD;
May the. grass grow over me afore I know it !"&#xD;
cried the scout, with a burst of enthusiasm&#xD;
His interrogator frowned darkly.&#xD;
" You will not swear-?" he said.&#xD;
" If all the trees in gender run was men, and&#xD;
all the branches and leaves on 'em Was bago-&#xD;
nets, and all the grass growing' round 'em was&#xD;
dead-shot rifles, and if all the sunbeams let&#xD;
down from heaven was rebel halters, I swear to&#xD;
ye that I wouldn't swear allegiance to your one-&#xD;
horse consarn ! You wince, do ye ? Prehaps&#xD;
you ain't, in the natur' o' things, dead to con-&#xD;
demnation and remorse. Think of what you've&#xD;
lost ! You've lost the Revolution ; you've lost&#xD;
your history ; you've lost the Cowpens, and&#xD;
the memory of the Swamp Fox, and the San-&#xD;
tee !"&#xD;
"No matter what we have lost," said Bene-&#xD;
diet, after a pause. "You are about to lose&#xD;
that which makes loss and gain the same thing."&#xD;
Then to one of the men who had brought him&#xD;
to the farm-house: "Where was this man tak-&#xD;
en ?"&#xD;
" Within our pickets, not far from Fairfax&#xD;
Court-House.  He tried to pass himself off,&#xD;
when surprised and questioned by our cavalry,&#xD;
as a Confederate scout, and resisted when told&#xD;
that he must go to head-quarters," was the re-&#xD;
ply.&#xD;
"There need b'e little waste of timein exam-&#xD;
ining this man," said Hurdlestone. "He was&#xD;
with Scott in Mexico. His business there was&#xD;
to obtain information of the enemy's move-&#xD;
ments. He was the most efficient scout in the&#xD;
service. To please the then victorious general,&#xD;
there was no secret skrviee too dangerous for&#xD;
&#xD;
him to undertake. Ie would have been a good&#xD;
man on the right side ; but being on the wrong,&#xD;
our duty is plain."&#xD;
" Pity that some whioh Went to Mexico hadn't&#xD;
died there : I have a man in my eye "-the&#xD;
scout advanced a step,'and looked sternly at&#xD;
Benedict-" I have a man in my eye which&#xD;
once had a good name. I have a man in my&#xD;
eye as went, to the battle-fields of Mexico, a ris-&#xD;
in' and accomplished officer, but whose name is&#xD;
now so black with treason that all the waters of&#xD;
the. Gulf wouldn't wash it white !"&#xD;
Benedict recoiled. A burning blush redden-&#xD;
ed his face. He gnawed his nether lip, as if in&#xD;
pain, and when he again spoke, his voice was&#xD;
husky with anger, or some other emotion.&#xD;
" Life is worth something to every one," b&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"Honor is worth more," interposed Scotto.&#xD;
" Death and the devil !" roared Hurdlestone,&#xD;
" Do you presume to teach us what honor is ?"&#xD;
" Too late for that !" sighed Scotto.&#xD;
"Enter our service ; serve us as faithfully as&#xD;
you have General Scott, and your life is saved,"&#xD;
said Benedict.&#xD;
" Never! never!'&#xD;
" Luke Scotto, you will be hanged !",&#xD;
"If you are not hanged, it will bo a singular&#xD;
thing in the 'history of nations !" retorted the&#xD;
scout, emphatically. " Your face, name, and&#xD;
fame are alike known to me. In days to come,&#xD;
the names of Beauregard, Davis, and a few oth-&#xD;
ers, will be recorded with that of Benedict Ar-&#xD;
nold, and held in the same contempt. That's&#xD;
prophecy, you may depend on't !"&#xD;
. Girdwood, at that moment, sound himself&#xD;
standing near Miss-Hurdlestone. While the at.&#xD;
tention of the other parties was fixed upon tho&#xD;
prisoner, she whispered in his ear:&#xD;
-' It isrBeauregard !"&#xD;
Her eyes glanced intelligently at Benedict.&#xD;
Another steadfast look at the compact figure of&#xD;
the latter, fully assured Ralph that he was in&#xD;
the presence of the distinguished rebel general,&#xD;
and. he comprehended at once the significant&#xD;
words of the scout.&#xD;
The deportment of the man had perplexed&#xD;
him from the first, but he was no longer a mys.&#xD;
tery. He mastered his surprise, and his grate-&#xD;
ful eyes thanked Hope Hurdlestone. While she&#xD;
was present, he was forgetful of his own posi-&#xD;
tion ; and he felt that her silent influence threw&#xD;
a protecting shadow over the prisoner, whose&#xD;
fate he now watched with the deepest interest.&#xD;
",You are not here -to talk polities," said&#xD;
Beauregard, whose assumed name we shall now&#xD;
lay aside. "We want money and ammunition&#xD;
more than Yankee sentiment. I will give you yet&#xD;
another chance forlife. Your shrewdness will&#xD;
soon tell you in what that chance consists You&#xD;
might not have any objections to tellin -me&#xD;

&#xD;
" I bought, and then ag'in I moughtn't I" an-&#xD;
swered, Scotto, with great self-possession.&#xD;
" Think not that aniy recollections of Mexico,&#xD;
on my part, will save you," added Beauregard.&#xD;
"1We are engaged in a desperate struggle, and&#xD;
a single life is as the fall of a leaf in the forest.&#xD;
War will have its terrible dues. We will pay&#xD;
tribute with our own blood and the blood of our&#xD;
e enies. Valuable information, however, shll&#xD;

anee of life and death ; turn the scale which&#xD;
way you will. You have free access to General&#xD;
Scott.  You know his plans. Make a clean&#xD;
breast, and a colonel's commission in the Con-&#xD;
federate Army shall be yours, as soon as it can&#xD;
be ratified by the'proper powers."&#xD;
Beauregard folded bis arms upon his chest,&#xD;
and looked steadily at the scout.&#xD;
Scotto stood unmoved and motionless. His&#xD;
sun-burned face kept sacredly the secret of his&#xD;
thoughts till his lips were r. ady to speak them.&#xD;
Every eye was fixed on him. H'pe Hurdle-&#xD;
stone, with parted lipa and suppressed breath,&#xD;
waited for his answer.&#xD;
"1You are silent," said Beauregard, impa-&#xD;
tiently.&#xD;
The scout drew himself straight and firm as a&#xD;
Virginia pine.&#xD;
" I live and die under the old flag !" he said,&#xD;
slowly and distinctly. " I want no commission&#xD;
among rebels. I despise both the Treason and&#xD;
the Traitor. The 'secrets that are within me,&#xD;
you'll have to cut out with your bowie-knives ;&#xD;

things. You hew down Union men like savages,&#xD;
because they dare to have opinions of their&#xD;

hangin' up of this six feet of flesh of mine, com-&#xD;

you can lay hands on, and see what the end&#xD;
on't'll be. Come on, traitors! I am ready !"&#xD;
'es" You shall be hanged in ten minutes !" said&#xD;
Beauregard, with compressed lips and scowling&#xD;
brow.&#xD;
" Thank ye, gen'ral! That's nine minutes&#xD;
mare nor I expected," replied Scotto, compos-&#xD;
edly. "I die for the Union!"&#xD;
Filled with admiration for the scout, Ralph&#xD;
Girdwood could no longer resist the impulse to&#xD;
say something in his favor.&#xD;
" Let me entreat you, sir, to save this brave&#xD;
fellow," he said, addressing Beauregard.&#xD;
"Spare your breath, sirI" replied the gener-&#xD;
&#xD;
al, with freezing coldness and a-flash of the eye&#xD;
that was far from encouraging.&#xD;
. " Soldiers," said Hurdlestone, in a voice in&#xD;
which no sympathy could be detected, "make&#xD;
ready outside there."&#xD;
Two or three of the men touched their caps,&#xD;
and hastened with great apparent satisfaction to&#xD;
obey this portentous order.&#xD;
"For humanity's sake," began Ralph, with&#xD;
much earnestness, when a keen and menacing&#xD;
glance from Beauregard stopped him.&#xD;
"I am obleeged to ye, young man," said&#xD;
Scotto, " for daring to speak a word for me ; but&#xD;
it's no use. A man who betrays his country&#xD;
won't show marey. Benedict Arnold, you re-&#xD;
member, was the worst on 'em all, arter he&#xD;
went over to the Britishers. Should you ever&#xD;
happen to see the old hero, Scott, tell him I've&#xD;
kicked the air at last, and shan't bring him no&#xD;
more news. Tell him, also, that there's a couple&#xD;
o' boys that I've took care on for about a dozen&#xD;
year, that may or mayn't be brothers, who'll&#xD;
need lookin' arter, I bein' hung and gone.&#xD;

be'decent buried, but I don't s'pose it'll make&#xD;
any great odds whether one's body rests atop or&#xD;
aneath the airth."&#xD;
He paused an instant, and looking sternly at&#xD;
Beauregard, said, interrogatively:&#xD;
"There's no sich thing as shootin', I a'-&#xD;
pose ?"&#xD;
" The fate of the spy is fixed from time im-&#xD;
memorial," answered Beauregard, lifting his&#xD;
eyes with strange intensity upon Girdwood,&#xD;
whose lips and cheeks grew white.&#xD;
"Major Andr6 was hanged," mused Scotto.&#xD;
"lHe was a fine fellow, too. I know a brace of&#xD;
critters, travelin' that road, that the same can't&#xD;
be said on."&#xD;
"All ready !" said a voice at the door.&#xD;
" Away with him I" ordered the general, per-&#xD;
emptorily.&#xD;
Before a hand could be laid upon Scotto,&#xD;
Hope Hurdlestone sprang between him and the&#xD;
soldiers.&#xD;
" Perpetrate not such a crime !" she cried,&#xD;
"Add not cold-blooded murder to your disloy-&#xD;
alty. This man's death will aid you not. ()&#xD;
General Beauregard, hear me, hear inc " She&#xD;
sank upon her knees at his feet.&#xD;
"Woman's natur' ak'in - woman's natur' 1'&#xD;
murmured Scotto. " Good gal! good gal!"&#xD;
Beauregard gently repulsed her, but she&#xD;
grasped his hand and held it.&#xD;
" You pain and embarrass me, Miss Hurdle-&#xD;

" Hope Hurdlestone," exclaimed her father,&#xD;
sternly, " you disgrace me !"&#xD;

"If you love the old flag, we are friends," she&#xD;
Answered, with a flush of enthusiasm. "But&#xD;
about this brave fellow," she added, quickly,&#xD;
pointing to the room where Scotto was secured.&#xD;
"He must escape 1"&#xD;
" Exactly my own thought, Miss Hurdlestone.&#xD;
I see no necessity of sacrificing such a life. How&#xD;
to assist him, however, is a matter of much per-&#xD;
lexity. I have great faith in your sagacity, and&#xD;
his cool judgment and quick hand. Once out-&#xD;
side this house, there will be.a strong probabil-&#xD;
ity in his favor."&#xD;
" There is another who may be useful in this&#xD;
endeavor. You will distrust my judgment when&#xD;
I inform you that I trust the fidelity of the&#xD;
black, Dagon."&#xD;
Hope Hurdleston smiled.&#xD;
Just then the shadow of a sentinel moved&#xD;
slowly across the window-panes.&#xD;
"Your opinion is of more weight than mine;,&#xD;
but I certainly should be disposed to doubt&#xD;
him, after hearing, as I did, his grotesque views,&#xD;
pf the North, as drawn forth ,by the colonel,&#xD;
your father."  -&#xD;
" Believe not half you-hear from Dagon and&#xD;
Haimon.   They are wiser than they .seem.&#xD;
Duplicity is taught the blacks from childhood&#xD;
by the stern lessons of servitude."-&#xD;
Both Hope and Ralph now stood facing the&#xD;
widows that opened on the piazza. Whenever&#xD;
theyisaw the automatic (figure of a sentinel,&#xD;
they stopped speaking, and went on when his&#xD;
short rounds took him out of sight.&#xD;
"Dat's true, Missy Hurd'stone !" said a voice&#xD;
behind them, that startled Ralph not a little.&#xD;
" Dat's true as the book of the Gospils ! But,&#xD;
Missy Hope, what makes ye for to go on in dis&#xD;
yer way? This am a ha'uted house. Dar am&#xD;
ghosts in the body, that walk 'bout and has&#xD;
ears. You's been talking' treason a heap, and I&#xD;
list crep' in and heerd it by dar back door."&#xD;
It was Dagon who thus surprised them.&#xD;
"No matter, Dagon, so long as you were the&#xD;
only listener," said Miss Hurdlestone, without&#xD;
apparent apprehension.&#xD;
" Dat, yer a'n't no s'cuse, missy," persisted&#xD;
Dagon, in a very serious manner. " You's too&#xD;
good for to be found out and cotched up by the&#xD;
'ceshers. I knows I's a contraban'; but the&#xD;
children o' darkness is sometimes wiser nor the&#xD;
children o' light."&#xD;
Ralph heard these wojds with secret consterna-&#xD;
Ron and dread. His onfidence in the black&#xD;
was not equal to the influence which he believ-&#xD;
ed he might. exert on Hope and himself. Nor&#xD;
could lie forget the catechism of the morning,&#xD;
in which Dagon had expressed his loyalty to his&#xD;
master and the South.&#xD;
Miss Iurdlestone, perceiving his apprehen-&#xD;
&#xD;
shone,"and suspecting rightly their cause, hasteu-&#xD;
ed to allay them.&#xD;
"Fear not Dagon," she said.  He is one of&#xD;
the faithful'among the unfaithful. I would trust&#xD;
him with my life."&#xD;
" res ye, Missy Hope, you might well say&#xD;
that yer 1" interposed Dagon, with a visible&#xD;
deepening of his voice and feelings. " You is&#xD;
the only cretur that keeps me 'wong do 'cesh,&#xD;
anyways. You see I isn't what I was. I's no&#xD;
longer a nigger, nor a chattel, but a contraban'.&#xD;
Now these yer contraban's, missy, can go any-&#xD;
whar they wants to. I 'spect we's alleys been&#xD;
contraban's, but nobody tole us. Abe Linkura&#xD;
was the fust man thatgive us the 'telligence, and&#xD;
I pray the Lor' in his massy to bress him for it,&#xD;
whether he be black or white ; though Mas'r&#xD;
Hurd'stone says he's black as the aceo' cards,&#xD;
and that Missus Linkum is the same. Though,"&#xD;
added Dagon, with a puzzled look, ItI don't see&#xD;
how that is, as she's got a brudder in the 'cesh&#xD;
army, white as anybody."&#xD;
"Is it possible, Miss Hurdlestone," asked&#xD;
Ralph, smiling, "that such absurd stories are&#xD;
circulated in the seceding States "&#xD;
"Not only circulated, but believed," replied&#xD;
Hope. "It was hardly good manners, Dagon,&#xD;
to steal upon us in this fashion," she added. " If&#xD;
I did not know your fidelity, I should be serious-&#xD;
ly displeased with you. You heard our conver-&#xD;
sation ?"&#xD;
"'Bout every swyllable, missy-'bout every&#xD;
swyllable, I should reekin' I" answered Dagon,&#xD;
coolly. "But it's safe-safe as a bigger in a&#xD;
swamp afore he's missed. Dis yer contraban'&#xD;
was list on the look-out for ye, and that's the&#xD;
truth. Tie colonel hisself, might come 'pon you&#xD;
onawar's ; but lie couldn't do it while dis yer&#xD;
nig was watching . Then the sogers, with the&#xD;
one- pronged forks on dar guns, might been put-&#xD;
tin' dar ,cars to one place and another, whar&#xD;
they hadn't no business."&#xD;
".Well, Dagon, since you know what we were&#xD;
talking of, what is your opinion of the matter ?&#xD;
She looked toward the room in which was&#xD;
Scotto.&#xD;
"I's drefful 'feard, missy, he'll wear the hemp&#xD;
collar. 'F Is found tryin' to help him off,&#xD;
shouldn't stan' no chance 't all. Judges and&#xD;
juries isn't for colored folks. It's the drawia'&#xD;
of a pistle, the running' up of a rope, or the&#xD;
whizzing' of a whip; and that's all the law we&#xD;
gits. Don't aspectt it's Abe Linkum hisself, shut&#xD;
up dar, does ye ? That caut be, nother, 'cause&#xD;
Mas'r would knowed him. But that don't make&#xD;
no odds. He's in trouble, and I's boun' to help&#xD;
him. So, niissy, you can count on dis yer eon-&#xD;
traban ,&#xD;
"What with General Beauregard, what with&#xD;
your father, and what with the sentries that un-&#xD;
round the house, the chances of the prisoner-&#xD;
are small," observed Ralph, reflectively. "No&#xD;

fied and relieved, as well as forgetful of his&#xD;
wrath toward' Hurdleston. ." Them's the pat-&#xD;
ent double-action fingers, though they ain't big-&#xD;
ger nor a woman's."&#xD;
A momentary glow of pride appeared on&#xD;
Beauregard's face. He had been noted for his&#xD;
strength.&#xD;
" Friend Murch," he said, his mind instantly&#xD;
reverting to the intelligence he had just heard,&#xD;
are you sure that you are not deceived ?"&#xD;
" Sure as a rifle-cannon ! If thar war any&#xD;
doubt, I should told ye. Kurnel Garnett was&#xD;
shot while tryin' to rally his men, and thar war&#xD;
bad work. Soon arter, Pegrani, who was wan-&#xD;
derin'- about in the mountains, caved in, and&#xD;
trott.d into the Yankee camp with a thousand&#xD;
men. They did so, gin'ral !"&#xD;
Girdwood saw Hurdlestone frowning at Jiis&#xD;
daughter, whose face expressed anything but&#xD;
grief.&#xD;
" A thousand prisoners !" mutter ed Beaure-&#xD;
gard.&#xD;
" Which were let go on their peril of honor,"&#xD;
interposed Zadoe.&#xD;
Looking up, the general saw a smile on Hope's&#xD;
lips, and tried to quell her with his eyes, but was&#xD;
discomfited, and smiled himself.&#xD;
" The otlth of allegiance !" sneered Hurdle-&#xD;
store. " They hanged the officers, I suppose ?"&#xD;
" No-; but they embalmed one on 'em,, and&#xD;
sent hiii, to his friends in a nice lox."&#xD;
llurdlestone was confused.&#xD;
" I believe little," he said, " in Northern cour-&#xD;
tesy and mercy."&#xD;
- Nobody axed you tol" retorted Zadoe.&#xD;
Wh keers for their courtesy or niassy ?. But&#xD;
the Feds war fools, though, in p'int o' common'&#xD;
senae, to let their prisoners go arter takin' a&#xD;
sw'a.- all round. Why, I sometimes sw'ar by&#xD;
the tour together, and think nothing' on't. They&#xD;
call this the peril of honor, the Feds do, 'cause&#xD;
if they're cotched in arms, arterward, they'll&#xD;
be shot."&#xD;
" Their parole will not, in all cases, be re-&#xD;
spected, I think," said Hurdlestone, with a&#xD;
shrug.&#xD;
" What are you going to do with these boys,&#xD;
Mr. Much ?" asked the general..&#xD;
" I'm gwine to l'arn 'em to be wise as sar-&#xD;
pents. I'm gwine to train'em up to thump and&#xD;
squeak right among the cannon-balls. it's a&#xD;
private band, you see. I have 'em the same a&#xD;
you have your bottle o' wine at dinner. In ba,&#xD;
&#xD;
tIe, they're to trot arter me with their drum and&#xD;
fife, playing' 'Dan Tucker' for dear afe. That's&#xD;
why them's boys is hyar. Long's kin hearbthe&#xD;
tap o' the drum and the squeak o' the fife.,&#xD;
there'll be mischief and motion in me It a&#xD;
Minie ball or a round shot should tumble me&#xD;
over, jest squeak and pound a beetle louder, and&#xD;
I'll up and at it ag'in."&#xD;
"Come with me, Zadoc," said the general;&#xD;
4 and you, also, clonel."&#xD;
The Confederate chief lingered a moment on&#xD;
the threshold, looked searchingly at Girdwood&#xD;
and Miss Hurdlestone, then thoughtfully retired&#xD;
to that apartment which had so many secrets,&#xD;
and kept them so well, followed by the colonel&#xD;
and Zdoc Murch.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
TiE MASKED BATTERIES OF MANAS SAS.&#xD;
Girdwood passed the dpy as well as he could&#xD;
in the circumscribed limits assigned him. Some-&#xD;
times standing on the open piazza, he watched&#xD;
the streamsof Confederate soldiers flowing and&#xD;
fluctuating this way and that ; sometimes lie&#xD;
east his eyes inquiringly up the Run, wondering&#xD;
why so much animation pervaded it ; sometimes&#xD;
he noted officers, in gay uniforms, appearing&#xD;
and disappearing mysteriously in the woods;&#xD;
sometimes he listened to the vague niurniur of&#xD;
camps ; sometimes the blast of the bugle echoes&#xD;
through the hills and valleys, with a wild yet&#xD;
stirring effect ; sometimes he marked messen-&#xD;
gers coming in hot haste to the head-quarters&#xD;
of the rebel chief ; and sometimes he listened'&#xD;
to the light step of Hope Hurdlestone within.&#xD;
Random pistol and musket shots ; occasion-&#xD;
ally the boom of cannon, with near or distant&#xD;
bursts of martial music, mingled with muffled&#xD;
voices ; the sound of busy axes, and the crash&#xD;
of falling trer a far in the depths of the forest,&#xD;
all conspired to give him a lively impression of&#xD;
the realities of war and the zeal of the Confed-&#xD;
erates.&#xD;
He saw the sun set, at length, with a feeling of&#xD;
relief on the imperfectly-seen and comli're,hend-&#xD;
ed activities of the Run. As the dimness of&#xD;
evening fell, the guard was doubled, and their&#xD;
vigilance increased. A sentinel was stationed&#xD;
in the narrow hall, near Scotto's door. His&#xD;
hope for the scout waned as he beheld these&#xD;
precautions. He mentioned his fears to Miss.&#xD;
Hurdleston, whose despondency Was greater&#xD;
than his own. From Beauregard he had re-&#xD;
ceived no further attention. That important&#xD;
personage, on whom centred so many thoughts&#xD;
and expectations, had been busy several hours&#xD;
with his clerks ; while the colonel was absent,&#xD;
scouring the country with the Black Horse&#xD;
Rangers. His absence might be protracted&#xD;
through the night, or he might appear at any&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
. One of Zadoc's boys was found asleep in'the&#xD;
hall. The sentinel shook him ; but he was se&#xD;

&#xD;
pitiably weary and drowsy. that, after being I&#xD;
shaken awhile, he was allowed to slumber on,&#xD;
with his drum beside him.&#xD;
Ralph breathed a few words of encourage-&#xD;
ment to Hope. but with so little enthusiasm that&#xD;
they failed of their purpose. He was conscious&#xD;
of being little else than a prisoner himself, and&#xD;
this feeling was equally well understood by her&#xD;
Whether within or without, he knew he was ob-&#xD;
served, and that knowledge was so annoying to&#xD;
his pride, that he sought solitude in the chamber&#xD;
that had been allotted him, utterly despairing&#xD;
of being of any service to the unfortunate scout,&#xD;
whose firm tread he could occasionally hear be-&#xD;
neath him. Although his mind had much to&#xD;
occupy it, his own safety among other consider-&#xD;
ations, lie could not help thinking of the pris-&#xD;
oner doomed at ten in the morning. Earnestly&#xD;
he deplored the stern usages of war that ren-&#xD;
dered such sacrifices necessary, or, at least,&#xD;
sanctioned them with belligerent powers. He&#xD;
did not thiuk: of repose, but sat with his face&#xD;
buried in his hands, pondering upon the dark&#xD;
scenes about to open upon the Old Dominion&#xD;
and other hitherto peaceful-States. Once or&#xD;
twice lie heard a fife squeaking shrilly various&#xD;
negro melodies, but did not heed it. Several'&#xD;
plans for the rescue of the loyal scout came and&#xD;
went,; but lie was painfully conscious that his&#xD;
position was too critical to compromise it by&#xD;
any possibly apparent interference.&#xD;
In the quietude and darkness he remained&#xD;
some hours, without any particular realization&#xD;
of the passage of time.'&#xD;
'Some one entered his chamber. Raising his&#xD;
head, he perceived a figure, dim, and scarcely&#xD;
distinguishable in the obscurity. This figure&#xD;
must have stolen up very softly, for he heard&#xD;
nothing until a moccasined foot tapped lightly&#xD;
on the floor.&#xD;
" Are ye hyar ?" asked a voice, which, though&#xD;
quite recognizable, was pitched on a soft and,&#xD;
seemingly, cautious key.&#xD;
" I am here," answered.Girdwood, falling in--&#xD;
to the same tone, and feeling quietly for his&#xD;
side-arms.     ,&#xD;
"What do you want?"&#xD;
"If I'd a wanted to harm ye, could done it-&#xD;
couldn't 1?" responded 'Murcl. "Stood look-&#xD;
in' a minute afore I made a noise. Thinkin' a&#xD;
good deal, ain't ye ? Prehaps it's the gal; pre-&#xD;
haps ag'in, it's other things?"&#xD;
Ralph knewnot whether to resent this famil-&#xD;
iarity or pass it over ; the latter course seemed&#xD;
the wisest. He was about to give a careless re-&#xD;
ply, when Zadoc added:'&#xD;
"W hy don't you air your legs, some'at?&#xD;
There's a bit o' moon in the sky, a shimmerin'&#xD;
like pale silver on the woods. Let's walk."&#xD;
"Really, Mr. Murch," said Girdwood, consid-&#xD;
erably embarrassed in view of the restriction&#xD;
laid upon him, " I scarcely feel like walking to-&#xD;
night. -I am not well, I believe."&#xD;
&#xD;
Zadoe s wide gash of a mouth seemed to grow&#xD;
wider with a cunning smile.&#xD;
' I know your health's awful delikit .Lut I&#xD;
thought that preliaps a sight of ' our works&#xD;
moughtn't do ye no harm !" he answered.&#xD;
"1, should liketo see them; but-but-"&#xD;
Ralph hesitated, for it was revolting to his&#xD;
pride to confess the truth.&#xD;
i" Look 'e hyar !" Murcli dallied with his huge&#xD;
bowie-knife. The young man looked,'but saw&#xD;
nothing unusual. A bushy figure loomed up&#xD;
before him, and that was all.&#xD;
"Now is your time! Come with ne! I'm&#xD;
wildcat! ' I'm Kentuck, Carline, Texas, and old&#xD;
Missip b'iled down. I'm a bitter tea for any&#xD;
one as molests me. Come along!"&#xD;
"It's impossible !" answered Girdwood, im-&#xD;
patiently, arising, and standing face to face with&#xD;
Murch.&#xD;
" Thar's no sich word as that ar in my Chioe-&#xD;
taw dictionary," answered Zadoc. "Wliat I sets&#xD;
my mind on, I do, lnd nothin' on airth can stop&#xD;
me. Trust in a Mississip;valley crocodile. and&#xD;
;ome arter me without fear. And, stop! Look 'e&#xD;
hyar! If a guard speaks, to ye, say'* Warren-&#xD;
ton.' Warrenton will take 'em down. TlIar's&#xD;
nothin' can stan' Warrenton hyar to-night."&#xD;
Girdwood was surprised; but adjusting his&#xD;
arms, lie followed Zadoc Murch, who added, as&#xD;
they crossed the threshold :&#xD;
" You needn't take pa'ins to step louder nor&#xD;
nat'ral, for B'uregard is at his dietatin' and writ-&#xD;
in' yet. He's allers late to bed, and liar's no&#xD;
need o' disturbin' him."&#xD;
Girdwood descended the stairs full of doubt&#xD;
and uncertainty, and treading very lightly. A&#xD;
bayonet stopped hii at the door. He whisper-&#xD;
ed " Warrenton." The glittering steel quivered&#xD;
an instant, then dropped, and lie passed on.&#xD;
Another line of sentinels was passed in the same&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
"Now," said Mureh, "we'll go up the ravine.&#xD;
We shall now and then 'be challenged ; but you&#xD;
know what to say."&#xD;
Zadoe, leading with steady, assured -steps,&#xD;
crossed the Warrenton Road and struck into the&#xD;
woods. The ground was uneven, lying in irreg-&#xD;
ular swells, with occasionally sharp hills and&#xD;
deep valleys.' They reached a stream or run,&#xD;
dry in most places, but with here and there a.&#xD;
pool of stagnant water.&#xD;
Girdwood began to feel a strange hum of life&#xD;
around him.&#xD;
" Look thar !" said Zadoe, pointing with his&#xD;
brown finger.&#xD;
"I see nothing," replied Ralph, " but an in-&#xD;
distinct maze of shrubbery."&#xD;
"Do you hear nothing ?" pursued Zadoc.&#xD;
"Yes, voices, and the hum of human pres-&#xD;
ence," said Ralph.&#xD;
" Come on !" added Murch.&#xD;
"I smell the smoke of smould'ing amp.&#xD;
I fires," said Ralph.&#xD;

SCOTTO, THE SCOUT ; OR, THE UNION RANGERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Who goes there ?" cried a sentinel.&#xD;
" Friendss" answered both.&#xD;
Advance, friends, and give the counter-&#xD;
sign."&#xD;
nWrrenton !"&#xD;
" Warrenton goes. Pass, friends I&#xD;
" What do ye see hyar ?" asked Mureb. His&#xD;
great aim lifted slowlyaand fixedly indicating a&#xD;
certain point.&#xD;
"rA masked battery !" replied Girdwood.&#xD;
Zadoe Murch turned and strode on.&#xD;
"Look yonder."&#xD;
"I see a wall of brush," replied Ralph, and his&#xD;
eccentric guidestalked 'on again. The word&#xD;
" Warrentomi" seemed omnipotent.&#xD;
"What do ye see now ?" -&#xD;
A masked battery, and dying camp-fires !"&#xD;
The broad figure of Zadoe Mureh pushed for-&#xD;
ward through the oak openings. The white&#xD;
moonlight fell upon him- as he moved on. A&#xD;
hundred-two hundred yards, were traversed.&#xD;
" Thar !" said Zadoe, abruptly- swinging his&#xD;
chubby arm in a certain direction. "What&#xD;
now?"&#xD;
" Some dried limbs, and the tall, undulating&#xD;
grass," said Ralph.&#xD;
Another short walk and another pause.,&#xD;
"What ag'in ?"   1&#xD;
" Masked batteries, camps, and dying camp-&#xD;
fires !"&#xD;
Zadoc glanced at his companion, filled his&#xD;
mouth with tie strong Indian weed, and chew-&#xD;
ing it savagely, resumed his steady course on-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
Soldiers started up from sleep and fell back&#xD;
heavily. A few restless ones looked after them&#xD;
dreamily; while now and then an acquaintance&#xD;
gave Murci rough greeting, or semt after him&#xD;
words of badinage., To these the man gave&#xD;
little heed. He seemed absorbed. Some over-&#xD;
powering thought was evidently working in his&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
"What place is this ?" questioned Girdwood.&#xD;
" The way to Manassas !" replied Mureb.&#xD;
The young man felt a chill upon him. Thiuk-&#xD;
Ing many things, lie followed his conductor.&#xD;
The position appeared fortified by nature.&#xD;
" Look once more," continued Zadoc.&#xD;
",A phalanx of trees," responded Ralph.&#xD;
" Come on! Now what ?"&#xD;
The suggestive arm was again raised.&#xD;
" A masked battery, camps, and dying camp-&#xD;
fires !" -&#xD;
The moonbeams fell in white threads upon&#xD;
the silent guns. The Confederate soldiers turn-&#xD;
ed unconsciously in their sleep, dreaming of&#xD;
distant friends.  The brands smoked in the&#xD;
rough and now-deserted kitchens. And thus&#xD;
the woodland walk continued, and battery after&#xD;
battery 'iet the eyes of Girdwood&#xD;
Miles of broken wooded country, rolling table-&#xD;
land, hills and vales, were traversed in this man-&#xD;
&#xD;
ner, with the constant recurrence of batteries&#xD;
and camps.&#xD;
Ralph was greatly impressed with what he be-&#xD;
held. He was perplexed, too, with the strange&#xD;
conduct of his guide, whose taciturnity was un-&#xD;
looked for. They finally left' the forest, to re-&#xD;
turn by a different route ; first, to cross some&#xD;
swampy ground, then through open fields and&#xD;
occasional clusters of oaks.&#xD;
"What have you seen ?" asked Murch."&#xD;
"What may be called a zig-zag line of forts,&#xD;
extending between two and three miles," answer.&#xD;
ed Girdwood.&#xD;
"Can the Federals take it ?"&#xD;
Zadoc turned a curious look at the young&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"Not without the advantage of numbers, and&#xD;
terrible loss of life !" replied Ralph, thought&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
" Jes' so I Now do you know the name of&#xD;
that thar place ? It's called Bull Run, here.&#xD;
about.".&#xD;
"tA place I never head mentioned at Wash-&#xD;
ington, or within the lines of the army of the&#xD;
Potomac. Tell me, Mr. Much, have our ene-&#xD;
mies no scouts ?"&#xD;
" Oh yes! Touton B'uregard's going' to hang&#xD;
one in the mornin !"%&#xD;
" Can it he possible," said Girdwood, continue&#xD;
ing the same train of reflection, " that the Yan-&#xD;
kees know nothing of the masked batteries of&#xD;
Manassas ?"&#xD;
" You'd better say nothin' about what you've&#xD;
seen down ihyar," added Mureb. "If B'uregard&#xD;
knowed where you'd been, you'd be treated to&#xD;
lost quarters till arter the advance of the inemy.&#xD;
That's a secret he gards like the apple of his&#xD;
"Why, then, have you led me through Bull&#xD;
Run ?" queried Ralphi.&#xD;
Look 'e hyar! Thar's things that musn't&#xD;
he talked about, nor meddled with. This is one&#xD;
on 'em. You've seen what no livin' man can&#xD;
see, not in full fellership with the Confeds, and&#xD;
pass that thar line of sentinels. You're one of&#xD;
us, and 'tan't 'no matter 'bout motives. But I&#xD;
can tell ye this : the Fed's'Il be cut up cruel, if&#xD;
they go down thar without knowin' what they're&#xD;
goin' into. I predict for 'em a bloody rout,&#xD;
sieb as was never seen in these parts. I, Zadoe&#xD;
Murch, say it !"&#xD;
By this time they were near the farm house.&#xD;
' Go in," he added, "and keep your own&#xD;
counsel. Breathe not a word of this breach&#xD;
old hoss. Look well to your own neck. Goo&#xD;
bye, till we meet ag'in."&#xD;
With this closing exhortation, delivered in a&#xD;
friendly tone, Zadoc Mureh turned on his, heel,&#xD;
and went his way.&#xD;
&#xD;
SCOTTO, THE SCOUT; OR, THE UNION RANGES.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
CHANGE o   F QUARTERS.&#xD;
Girdwood went quietly to his room. It was&#xD;
midnight ; and, soon after, he heard the rebel&#xD;
chief retire to his chamber ; but, apparently,&#xD;
not to sleep, for his restless footsteps we e audi-&#xD;
ble for a long time.&#xD;
The young man stretched himself on his bed ;&#xD;
but thoughts of the prisoner below, and Hope&#xD;
Ilurdlestone, banished repose, and when lie at&#xD;
length slumbered, he dreamed of masked bat-&#xD;
teries.&#xD;
He met Hurdlestone, and Hope, and the gen-&#xD;
eral at the breakfast-table, at a late hour in the&#xD;
morning. He was treated with marked coldness'&#xD;
by the latter. He watched Hope's countenance,&#xD;
hoping to get good news from it respecting Luke&#xD;
Scotto ; but her expression was downcast and&#xD;
anxious. The meal passed in comparative si-&#xD;
lence, and Ralph was heartily glad when it was&#xD;
ended. The guard still environed the house,&#xD;
and a soldier stood leaning on his musket at&#xD;
Scotto's door.-&#xD;
" You'd better leave the room, Hope," said&#xD;
the colonel.&#xD;
The young woman shook her head, and re-&#xD;
mained.&#xD;
Low orders were given, and preparations of&#xD;
some nature were made in the clump of oaks&#xD;
before the house. Girdwood tried to get an op-;&#xD;
portunity to speak to Hope., Gradually getting&#xD;
near her, he whispered: .&#xD;
" Has anything been done, Miss Hurdlestone 2"&#xD;
" No," she answered ; "no chance has been&#xD;
given. The surveillance has been so close that-&#xD;
found it impossible to move. Poor fellow I"&#xD;
Ralph sighed, and, perceiving the eyes of&#xD;
Beauregard upon him, colored.&#xD;
A file of men appeared.&#xD;
"Take hiim out!' said Hurdlestone, in a sup-&#xD;
pressed voice, glancing at his daughter, and&#xD;
leavin gthe roam.&#xD;
"Imeant,' said Hope, addressing Beaui'e-&#xD;
gard, " to have appealed to your magnanimity&#xD;
again; but see, by your expression, that the&#xD;
gates of mercy are closed. You are fortified,&#xD;
in advance, against the attacks of pity.&#xD;
"You are right, Miss Hurdlestone. Spare&#xD;
yourself humiliation, and me a scene."&#xD;
This was uttered in a manner that offended the&#xD;
pride of Hope.&#xD;
"If your bandit ancestor were brought in&#xD;
from the hills of Mexico." she added, with a&#xD;
slight toss of the'heid, and asarcastic glitter of'&#xD;
the eyes, " I would not put up cry nor prayer&#xD;
for him!"&#xD;
The face of the traitor-general reddened with&#xD;
anger.&#xD;
"You shall regret this. Miss- Hurdlestone !&#xD;
To cast at me the foul slanders of the Northern&#xD;
press, is something you might have spared me,&#xD;
e without detriment to your cause and wishes."&#xD;
&#xD;
Nay, the 'story came from your a.. a'al&#xD;
hills; and you will find it in the Diario di Mejico;&#xD;
also, translated and copied into sundry Anglo-&#xD;
Saxon sheets," responded Hope, glad to see that&#xD;
her shaft had taken effect.&#xD;
", There's no military discipline for you, Miss&#xD;
Hurdlestone. The tongue of your sex is a&#xD;
weapon that cannot be guarded against. And&#xD;
yet," he added, frowning, "even women have&#xD;
sometimes suffered for political sins."&#xD;
" They have been whipped in Southern lati-&#xD;
tudes," murmured Hope.&#xD;
" Death and the devil 1" cried the colonel, at&#xD;
that moment. "Where's the prisoner ?"&#xD;
A corporal had just opened the door, and was&#xD;
starring, with open mouth, into Scotto's room.&#xD;
The colonel, seeing him, dashed through the&#xD;
hall, with the foregoing exclamation. He look-&#xD;
ed into the dim, little apartment ; lie searched&#xD;
every corner with his troubled eyes ; but Luke&#xD;
Scotto was not there.- He had escaped. The&#xD;
window was fastened, nothing was disturbed, and&#xD;
Hurdlestone sought in vain for a clue to his&#xD;
mysterious disappearance.&#xD;
" We have been cheated and cajoled !" he&#xD;
roared. " There are traitors among us 1"&#xD;
"Colonel Hurdlestone,"   said Beauregard,&#xD;
culdl,"bring out your man "&#xD;
" General," an swered Hurdlestone, his voice&#xD;
husky with anger, "he has escaped I I know&#xD;
not how ; but the fact is obvious. The guards&#xD;
have been tampered with, or the devil helped&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"A fair devil, I'll warrant I" retorted Beau'&#xD;
regard, looking at Hope.&#xD;
"I understand you, sir 1" said Hope, with&#xD;
quiet hauteur.&#xD;
"Nor do you deny the implication," resumed&#xD;
the general.&#xD;
"1The will, sir. I do not deny ; but the oppor.&#xD;
unity I moat certainly do," she returned, with&#xD;
dignity.&#xD;
" She shall take his place, and feed on bread&#xD;
and water I" protested the colonel, in geat ex-&#xD;
citement. " in with you, miss-in with you I&#xD;
I'll teach you that I can punish traitors of my&#xD;
own household !"&#xD;
Hope stood, calm and unmoved. She glanced&#xD;
at the Confederate leader, with an expression&#xD;
that said :&#xD;
"See the storm you have raised !"&#xD;
Girdwood remained, astounded, in the back-&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
Hurdlestone seemed determined to enforce his&#xD;
hasty menace.&#xD;
" Do you hear me, girl ?  You are no. daugh.&#xD;
ter of mine, if you aid and comfort traitorsI"&#xD;
raged the colonel, striding, with angry gestures,&#xD;
about the room.&#xD;
" I will obey you. father, if you do not change&#xD;
your mind, after a moment's reflection," an-&#xD;
swered Hope, unruffled and dignified.&#xD;
" Be silent, sir !" exclaimed the general, an-&#xD;

citement produced by h          as singulrabinterview&#xD;

bitterly-raging civil strife.&#xD;

himself. many times.- With the gloomy reali-&#xD;
ties of death before him, he was forced to an-&#xD;

length, is au different thing than when beheld&#xD;
at a distance.   en brave men reluct and&#xD;
shrink from the approaches of the pitiless ty-&#xD;
rant. Girdwood wished fervently for life and&#xD;
its enjoyments.&#xD;
He sat dawn, and his head sank into his hsnd-&#xD;
ouffed lands. The love of Hope Hurdlestone&#xD;
bad given a new charm to existence. He heard,&#xD;
without,- the hum of vamps, the challenges of&#xD;
sentris, the occasional tap of the drum, the&#xD;
blare of trumpets, and now and then the rever-&#xD;
bes-atioi of the dist nt signal-gun. He sense.l&#xD;
more fily than ever that he was living in the&#xD;
midst of var. But, strange inconsistency! he&#xD;
did not regret his visit to Manassas; for it was&#xD;
his introduction t Hope. Suggestive name?&#xD;
It kept ringing- in his ears. It sounded again&#xD;
ashd agalt. It made music in the mystic cham-&#xD;
bers of his brain. Could he wholly despair&#xD;
wh le Hope was in his hart, touching, with in-&#xD;
visible fingers, itsresponsive stilgs&#xD;
Hours rolled over the bowed head of Gird-&#xD;
wood.'&#xD;
When the night fell, a candle and writing-ma-&#xD;
terials were brought and placed beside him, in&#xD;
ominous silence.  In defiance of his strong&#xD;
nerves, this circumstance shocked him not a&#xD;
little; for it was full of meaning. It said : "If&#xD;
you have any parting words to leave, you are&#xD;
permitted to write them."&#xD;
Atfirst, ie was tempt d to comply with this&#xD;
invitation; but reflection changed his mind.&#xD;
"If this is to be," lie mused, "I will die&#xD;
without sign. or witness. Besides, it may be a&#xD;
snare to entrap me. If I have secrets, I will&#xD;
keep them."&#xD;
Be he pushed the pen and paper from him,&#xD;
and the night flowed slowly on. The candle on&#xD;
the little pine table diinly burned, flashing and&#xD;
falling with melancholy light.&#xD;
A sudden vibration startled him. It came&#xD;
from the floor under his feet. Presently a board&#xD;
began to lift, rising gradually and noiselessly.&#xD;
Ralph watched the phenomenonwith lively in-&#xD;
terest. It portended,'something. What was it?&#xD;
A human hand became visible, the board was&#xD;
pushed entirely aside, and a head arose to view.&#xD;
Girdwood sat fixed'and mute, staring in won-&#xD;
der at this sub-munilane appearance. The face&#xD;
turned silently toward him. As quickly as he&#xD;
-oould, with his manacled hands, he seized the&#xD;
light,'and held it downward ; and it threw its&#xD;
pale rays on the features of Scotto, the Scout&#xD;
The surprise of Ralph was complete. Of all&#xD;
the faces he might have expected to see, Luke&#xD;
Scotto's was not among them. Doubt, hope,&#xD;
aid strong curiosity possessed him. He waited&#xD;
for the key to this mystery, nor was he- kept&#xD;
long in suspense.&#xD;
The scout laid his finger on his lips, then, ele-&#xD;
vating his arm, beckoned him to 'ollow. At&#xD;
that moment, a scrap of paper fluttered to the&#xD;
&#xD;
floor. Gird" ood eagerly' picked it up. Upon&#xD;
it was wriitten, in iope's harndwi'iting&#xD;
The cpuatrsig n, to-n'g/,t, is Richmond !"&#xD;
He ianled it to Scotto, who nodded with a&#xD;
satisfied air, and signified, by another and more&#xD;
imperative motion, that he should immediately&#xD;
lower himself through the opening. It was not&#xD;
a time for questioning or explanation, and he&#xD;
instantly obeyed the admonition. He found&#xD;
himself stan~dinig on the firm earthen-floor of a.&#xD;
4cllar. He would have taken the candle, but&#xD;
the scout shook his ieid, and he left it burning.&#xD;
Scotto then replaced the board, and] they were&#xD;
in total darkness. Taking him by the arm, his&#xD;
guide led him several paces, and presently he&#xD;
saw the moonlight creeping through an opening&#xD;
in the wall.&#xD;
" Be quiet !" whispered Scotto; and, mount-&#xD;
ing a box, looked out cautiously. ' When you&#xD;
hear the sentinel say ' About.' be within reach of&#xD;
me."&#xD;
With these low-breathed instrucions, the&#xD;
scout's body darkened the hole, and Ralph was&#xD;
conscious, an inst-nt after, that he was lying in&#xD;
the grass outside. He stepped upon the box,&#xD;
his heart beating as he had never before known&#xD;
it to beat. Just then, a sentinel said - About !"&#xD;
A strong hand grasped his shoulder, and he&#xD;
w.s dragged through the narrow outlet, and&#xD;
pressed hard and prone to the earth. His emo-&#xD;
tions were indescribable. le tried to bring&#xD;
every muscle into subjection, and to hush his,&#xD;
respiration.' Another life was staked, and for&#xD;
him. The sentinel passed the corner of the&#xD;
house, and for a moment was hidden from view.&#xD;
The garden was a few yards distant, and in it&#xD;
was a trellis, covered with vines. A gentle pull&#xD;
admonished Ralph that the critical moment had&#xD;
arrived. Scotto half arose, glided across the in-&#xD;
tervening space, and sank down -behind the&#xD;
trellis ; and the young main imitated his move-&#xD;
ments with wonderful fidelity.&#xD;
'An approving pressure signified the scout's&#xD;
satisfaction.' They e lay there, entirely screened&#xD;
by the foliage, till the sentinel passed and re-&#xD;
turned again.&#xD;
About ten yards from this .screen was some&#xD;
shrubbery, and trees beyond. The distance be-&#xD;
tween was rather open, but darkened by the&#xD;
shadows of surrounding objects.&#xD;
"Now !" whispered Scotto , and they ran this&#xD;
dangerous gauntlet in safety, then crept away&#xD;
among the oaks. All seemed to go well till&#xD;
they came upon a figure lying upon the ground,&#xD;
asleep, apparently.&#xD;
Girdwood was'seized with apprehension ; but&#xD;
Scotto advanced without fear, and the figure&#xD;
cautiously arose. It was Dagon, to the un-&#xD;
speakable relief of Ralph.&#xD;
" Take off the ruffles !" said Scotto.  The&#xD;
black applied a key, and relieved the young&#xD;

The darkness that precedes the -dawn now lent&#xD;
a deeper gloom to the swamp. The hum of the&#xD;
Confederate camp had long since died away in&#xD;
the distance.&#xD;
Peleg and Pickering spread a couch of cedar&#xD;
boughs, and Scotto and Girdwood stretched&#xD;
their weary limbs upon it.&#xD;
CHAPTER XiV.&#xD;
IN THE sWAMP.&#xD;
When Girdwood awoke, the sun had reached&#xD;
the meridian. ie was surprised that his slum-&#xD;
bers had been so profound and protracted, but&#xD;
weariness and relief from anxietyhad contribut-&#xD;
ed to 'his repose. The hound Jule was watch-&#xD;
ing beside him; but Luke Scotto and the fight-&#xD;
ing brothers were not to be seen. He wonder-&#xD;
od at this desertion, and at first was inclined to&#xD;
regard it as a breach of friendship; but re-&#xD;
flection brought different feelings. He believed&#xD;
that Scotto would return, and resolved to wait&#xD;
a reasonable time for his appearance. He was&#xD;
very thirsty, and searched for water.: Finding-&#xD;
some dark, brackish pools in the swamp, he&#xD;
drank from them, and the warm, thick fluid was&#xD;
more grateful to his parched tongue than the&#xD;
clearest water lie had ever tasted.&#xD;
. Leaving the cedar jungle, he endeavored to&#xD;
obtain a viewof the surrounding country, but&#xD;
on account of its inequality, could see but lit-&#xD;
tle. In a distant field, however, he discovered&#xD;
what seemed to be a company of Confederate&#xD;
skirnishers or scouts, and retreated to the&#xD;
swamp, the cover of which lie- had scarcely&#xD;
gained, when he had reason to congratulate&#xD;
himself on his prudence, for a small body of&#xD;
horse, a moment later, crossed the open space&#xD;
space beyond.&#xD;
Keeping the hound crouched beside him, he&#xD;
observed the progress of the riders, who were&#xD;
evidently a squad of the Black Cavalry, either&#xD;
searching, for hiniself or reconnoitering. Thee&#xD;
passed slowly by his li ing-place., The ground&#xD;
being soft, the horses sank to -their fetloelks,&#xD;
precluding the idea of speed. When directly&#xD;
opposite, and within a dozen yards. of him, he&#xD;
recognized, with a heart-throb of apprehension,&#xD;
the stabuart proportions of Ceolneliurdle-&#xD;
stone.&#xD;
ie pressedathe delicate head of the dog to&#xD;
the earth to prevent her from seeing her master&#xD;
aid bounding after him, as she might be likely&#xD;
to do.&#xD;
"These escapes'have been very singular," he,&#xD;
heard llunrdlestone remark.&#xD;
.Secret enemies are the worst enemies." a&#xD;
horseman, wear ng the bige of a lieutenant,&#xD;
replied.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"1 know of it secret enemies at the genera'a&#xD;
head-quarters," returned the colonel.&#xD;
"They may be in one's own household,""sd&#xD;
the other, moodily.-                     f&#xD;
4 Lieutenant Storrow," answered llurdlestone;&#xD;
haughtily, "the Confeder icy has no active&#xD;
enemy in household of mine. I throw back&#xD;
your insinuation with scorn, and its repetition&#xD;
will call forth my-resentment."&#xD;
" I meant no offence," responded Storrow, with&#xD;
the same dissatisfied manner. "I but know th&#xD;
two spies have mysteriously slipped through onr&#xD;
fingers, and are now laughing at the hangman,&#xD;
and carrying 1 know not what important'infor-&#xD;
matiop to tIe Union Army. Prisoners can't get&#xD;
from under our very noses without help, especi-&#xD;
ally when they are in irons and doubly guard-&#xD;
ed."&#xD;
" I like not your tone !" retorted IHurdlestone,&#xD;
with displeasure. " I was made responsible for&#xD;
their safe keeping, and these two escapes touch&#xD;
mue more nearly than you or any other officer.&#xD;
To the general-in-chief I am accountable, and to&#xD;
no other."&#xD;
"You know best, sir; but if I had my way,&#xD;
there should be no more escapes between seir-&#xD;
tence and the halter. I'd hang 'em right up,&#xD;
sir-right up! - I had my suspicions of that oily&#xD;
fellow, Girdwood, from the beginning. The bul-&#xD;
let-hole through his cap didn't deceive me. I&#xD;
wouldn't give that for his dispatches !" Storraw&#xD;
snapped his thumb and finger contemptuously.&#xD;
" But he's had a fine time among us," he Went&#xD;
on, now addressing his conversation apparently&#xD;
to a man on his left. "He has fared well and&#xD;
fed well, And it is rumored that e has found&#xD;
time to toy with the boy Cupid. If certain&#xD;
parties do not belie him, lie has not tried his&#xD;
arts of pleasing in vain."&#xD;
" Forward !" cried the colonel, spurring his&#xD;
horse anddashing on.&#xD;
The horsemen ascended the ridge, and soon&#xD;
disappeared on the other side. Girdwood was&#xD;
infinitely relieved by their speedy Iassage from&#xD;
sight. Going back to the spot where he' hraf&#xD;
slept, lie awaited the return of the scout, soie-&#xD;
times gazing up at the sky through the broad,&#xD;
dark-green branches of the cedar interposed be-&#xD;
tween himi and the hot rays of the sun likb a&#xD;
sheltering hand, sometimes caressing the hound,&#xD;
and always thinking of Hope Hurdlestone.&#xD;
Preseintly he heard quick,"light steps in the&#xD;
swamp, and' Scotto, long looked for, dame at&#xD;
last.&#xD;
"What news?" asked Girdwood, impatiently.&#xD;
Just then heavy firing was heard iii. the diree-&#xD;
tion of Manassas.&#xD;
Hark!" said Scotto. "General Tyler has&#xD;
waked up some rebel batteries, I reekin, down&#xD;
to the Rui.",  -   .&#xD;
"The attaek,.then, is premature V' exclaimed&#xD;
Ralph.&#xD;
" Th-y're itot gii' to attack in force to-day.&#xD;

as          SCOTTO, THE SCOUT ; OR, THE UNION RANGERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
They're makin' a strong reconnoisanee of the&#xD;
enemy's position," replied the scout.&#xD;
" Strong indeed, if one may judge by those&#xD;
heavy, rapid discharges of cannon. I am fear-&#xD;
ful that their patriotic ardor has outrun their&#xD;
prudence, if 1 can judge correctly by-the sound&#xD;
of the firing, nothing less than crushing brigades&#xD;
should be thrown upon them at that point.&#xD;
Single regiments will not do. See!1 Wreaths&#xD;
of smoke are curling.up to the sky."&#xD;
"'There'll be more smoke to-morrer. Our&#xD;
army has passed Fairfax, and ndw rests at Cen-&#xD;
treville, stretching to the right and left like bats'&#xD;
r wings. To-morrer '11 be the 21st, an dSundav';&#xD;
and a great battle will be fou't. God he only&#xD;
knows what the result '1l be I"&#xD;
" Disastrous,- I'm afraid. They don't know&#xD;
what they're going to fight. There's a great&#xD;
difference between meeting an enemy in open&#xD;
AeId, and intrenched on ground of his own&#xD;
choosing. Even undisciplined volunteers can&#xD;
fight behind breastworks. Then they have the&#xD;
ad vantage of knowing the country. There is&#xD;
mot a cow-paths they are unacquainted with."'&#xD;
" True !" responded Scotto. " But if our&#xD;
boys were well commanded, I shouldn't have no&#xD;
fear for the end on't."&#xD;
" Av f There's the rub. Many of the Fed-&#xD;
e+al oiffaers have never smelled gunpowder, ex-&#xD;
oeot in woodcock and snipe-shooting, There's&#xD;
a-vast difference between mustard-seed shot and&#xD;
cannon balls. Let us hurry to -Centreville," an-&#xD;
swered Girdwoods with earnestness._&#xD;
" Be patient," said Scotto, coolly. " The&#xD;
Black Calvary are out in every direction, and&#xD;
wouldn'tt be pleasant to fall into their clutches.'&#xD;
Ik the morning , airly, there'll be work in airnest.&#xD;
It there's no accident, you'll hear the thunder of&#xD;
cannon with the rising' of the sun, when, if you've&#xD;
a-mind for sarvice, you can fall in with the Six-&#xD;
-ninth, or the Fire Zarves, or whatsoever&#xD;
iment you like. The Sixty-ninth, I've hear,&#xD;
w il have the post of honor, and lead up to the,&#xD;
batteries. Their time's out, and they can go&#xD;
kme, every man of 'em ; but they ain't the&#xD;
bey 'to show the white feather in sight of an&#xD;
iaemy. I wish I could say as, much of the&#xD;
Peans lvania Fourth, which, in the mornin', '1l&#xD;
take the back track."&#xD;
" Turn their backs on their brothers-in-arms?&#xD;
Impossible I" exclaimed Girdwood.&#xD;
" When the Sixty-ninth and other gallant&#xD;
lads march to danger and, death, the Pennsyl-&#xD;
vania Fourth will left foot, right foot, torards&#xD;
safety and home."&#xD;
Luke Scotto contracted his brows, and me-&#xD;
ehanically tightened the belt around his loins.&#xD;
"It pains me to hear it.' Every regiment will&#xD;
be needed."&#xD;
"Ay ! They might stay with the reserve&#xD;
force, rather than turn back, if they don't keer&#xD;
to snuff gunpowder. Howsomever, let 'em go.&#xD;
&#xD;
They'll git a name oy it that nobody 'II covet.&#xD;
What's into 'em, I wonder?"&#xD;
"Not cowardice, I hope? Not want of patri-&#xD;
otism, I trust ? Where ai-e. those singular&#xD;
lads ?"'&#xD;
" Couldn't keep 'em, ticeri'ore let 'em go.&#xD;
They was off likesky-rockets soon as never they&#xD;
heerd the big guns ; for there's been firin' at&#xD;
odd jobs for a long spell. What day of the&#xD;
month did I say it was ?"&#xD;
" The 20th."&#xD;
" Then the 21st of July will- be a day in our&#xD;
history. Prehaps a dark, prehaps a bright one.&#xD;
On the 21st, the star-spangled critters, if they&#xD;
have a chance, will try tCoir steel on them as&#xD;

Mexico. I've seen the old flag carried triumph-.&#xD;
antly hundreds o' miles into the inemy's coun-&#xD;
try. I've seen it wave over cities, and forts, and&#xD;
bloody fields."&#xD;
Scotto looked up, raised his right arm, ana&#xD;
his face glowed with enthusiasm.&#xD;
" They was the pride o' nations, the Stars- and&#xD;
Stripes was ; they was the hope o' the misera-&#xD;
ble and downtrodden everywhere . There's a&#xD;
heavy account to reehin. We'll foot up the&#xD;
whole on't presently. I said I didn't mind the&#xD;
battle for my own sake. But there's young lads&#xD;
in the army that ain't seasoned to the malan-&#xD;
choly sights o' war. Their hearts '11 fly up into&#xD;
their throats, at fust, but th'ey'li get used to it'&#xD;

with the veterans. Many on'em won't go back,&#xD;
in course not. Their bodies '11 enrich this sile,&#xD;
but their names won't never die.'&#xD;
Scotto, the scout, continued to gaze ak the&#xD;
sky, and his brown face was calm and earnest.&#xD;
" Even soI" responded Girdwood, impressive-&#xD;
ly. And each felt that the morrow was big with&#xD;
events.&#xD;
-°CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
AT MANASSAS.&#xD;
With the first burst of artillery on the event-&#xD;
ful morning of the 21st, Ralph Girdwood&#xD;
sprang to his feet. The scout was already on&#xD;
the alert.&#xD;
"It's General Tyler's division," he said.&#xD;
"They've hail a long march, and are directly&#xD;
atween us and the inemy."S&#xD;
"The guns speak loudly. They are much&#xD;
nearer than I supposed. Now is our time," re-&#xD;
sponded Ralph, eager for the affray.&#xD;
" Stay  come'at!s  There's no hurry  yet.&#xD;
You'll have enough on't afore night."&#xD;
Girdwood looked at Scotto inquiringly, and&#xD;
chafed at his inexplicable delay.&#xD;
" Trust an old fighter, and don't fret," he&#xD;
said, in reply to the young man's impatient,&#xD;
glance.&#xD;
The hound Jule arose from the foliage where&#xD;

&#xD;
black and flitting shadows, relieved only by the&#xD;
glitter of sabre-bayonets and unsheathed knives.&#xD;
For a time, the clamor of human voices ceased.,&#xD;
Both infantry and horse-stood silent, while the&#xD;
rifled guns poured in their horrible hail of shell&#xD;
and spherical'shot.   .     A&#xD;
Then there arose a yell that made the forest&#xD;
reverberate with a thousand thrilling echoes.&#xD;
The Zouaves had crept upon a battery and taken&#xD;
it. Immediately after, there was a terrific crash&#xD;
that shook the earth, and made the air vibrate&#xD;
in sulphurous waves. Another concealed bat-&#xD;
tery had opened upon the gallant Zouaves, who&#xD;
were flung backward inbleeding masses. -&#xD;
" As I feared ! As I feared t" exclaimed Gird-&#xD;
wood. " This is the Valley of Death."&#xD;
"Too late to think on't," added Scotto. "We&#xD;
must fight it out." Then to his Rangers:&#xD;
" Boys, stan' your ground and strike whenever&#xD;
there's a chance. Cut, hack, and slew! Eat&#xD;
your way into this p'ison rebellion. Let 'em&#xD;
see what's into ye."-&#xD;
At that moment Major Meagher was seen riding&#xD;
to and fro on a spirited horse, waving his hat,&#xD;
and cheering the Sixty-ninth to the onset.&#xD;
Sherman's battery replied as well as it could to&#xD;
the rebel fire, and the battle again became gen-&#xD;
eral. Scotto, at the head of his command, rag-&#xD;
ed to and fro, seeking in vain for the )Black&#xD;
Horse Cavalry. ,&#xD;
And thus the conflict went on. The sun went&#xD;
swimming past the meridian, red and fiery, ob-&#xD;
scured by clouds of black and stifling snioke,&#xD;
Men fell down and died. without wounds, from&#xD;
heat and thirst.&#xD;
The enemy gave groun'd. slowly at first, but&#xD;
yith a rout at last. The victors cheered, and&#xD;
the wounded and dying lifted up their voices&#xD;
with the rest. The word passed up and down the&#xD;
lines that the day was won. Comrades in arms&#xD;
shook hands and congratulated each other, and&#xD;
weary officers talked of a victory. Every loyal&#xD;
heart beat high. Soldiers forgot eight hours of&#xD;
fighting and a harrassing march beneath sultry&#xD;
skies, and tasted their reward in the triumph of&#xD;
the moment&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
rH3 BLACK HORSM CAVALRY.&#xD;
While the troops stood panting and thirsting,&#xD;
there eame an order to fall back. No one could&#xD;
definitely trace the origin of the order, butfpuch&#xD;
an order there appeared to be; and various regi-&#xD;
ments that had been most 'hotly engaged, much&#xD;
thinned and disorganized, made a retrograde&#xD;
movement to the open fields. Much 'surprised,&#xD;
Girdwood - and Scotto followed them. When&#xD;
they reached the open space, they found the&#xD;
Fire Zouaves already there, cool, collected, ,and&#xD;
charheteristically unconcerned. They, with the&#xD;
debris of other regiments, were retreating slow-&#xD;
ly, without hurry or flurry, toward their camp&#xD;
at Centreville.&#xD;
&#xD;
Girdwood presently heard the words. "John-&#xD;
ston ! Re-enforcements I" which ran from mouth&#xD;
to mouth along the broken lines. Just then&#xD;
clouds of dust wet-e seen; indicating a grand&#xD;
flanking movement of the enemy. The troops&#xD;
quickened their pace. Scotto rode among diem,&#xD;
entreating them to form again and fling back&#xD;
the foe ; but the worried tides of men and horses&#xD;
rolled on. Anon there was a cry : " The Black&#xD;
Horse I The Black Horse !"&#xD;
The officers made a desperate effort to stay&#xD;
the' reflex current ; they shouted, persuaded,&#xD;
threatened. Scotto and Girdwood aided them&#xD;
in this endeavor, and finally the Sixty-ninth, a&#xD;
Wisconsin regiment,' and a portion of the F-e&#xD;
Zouavet, forced to receive the chai-ge of the&#xD;
Black Horse Cavalry.&#xD;
Scotto and his Rangers drew up on the left,&#xD;
glad of an opportunity to meet that redoubt-&#xD;
able body of men. They came with thunder-&#xD;
ous noise, the heavy tramp of six hundred horses&#xD;
shaking the ground like an earthquake. They&#xD;
came in their pride, and insolence, and contempt&#xD;
of Northern courage. The clank and jangle of&#xD;
their spurs and sabres were like the din of&#xD;
workshops.&#xD;
Foremost among those charging squadrons&#xD;
Girdwood descried the grim and stalwart figure&#xD;
of Hurdlestone, He was leading the onset, and&#xD;
his voice rang out stern and clear.&#xD;
Girdwood'thought of Hope, and an involun-&#xD;
tary shiver went over him.&#xD;
A terrible silence fell upon the devoted regi-&#xD;
ments. Each mant grasped more firmly his&#xD;
musket, and turned a face of iron resolution to&#xD;
the rushing foe. The front rank sank u pon one&#xD;
knee, and with those in the rear, formed a fear-&#xD;
ful wall of glittering bayonets. Not a gun was&#xD;
fired till the Black Horse rangers were within&#xD;
twenty yards, then a sheet of flame met them&#xD;
in the faces, and the head of the column stag-&#xD;
gered and fell.&#xD;
While dizzy and reeling with the first shock,&#xD;
another destroying storm of lead was poured&#xD;
upon them, and the next in order went down,&#xD;
to embarrass and obstruct those behind.  -&#xD;
For a few moments there was a continuous&#xD;
and deadly hail of Minis balls. Proud steeds&#xD;
fell by scores. There was a fl ightful mass of&#xD;
men and horses struggling in the throes of&#xD;
death.&#xD;
"Come on 1" shouted Scotto ; and leaning for-&#xD;
ward in his saddle, he led his men into the&#xD;
floundering chaos of the nearly-annihilated&#xD;
cavalry. 'The Zouaves, with loud yells, plung.&#xD;
ed after them, and when they came ont 'of the&#xD;
melee, their long sabre-bayonets were no longer&#xD;
bright, and horse and rider, on that field, were&#xD;
found thrust through and through, when the&#xD;
dead were buried. ' Some of those dark-haired&#xD;
steeds were ridden to Washington by the lads&#xD;

" How goes the battle ?" he asked in a faint&#xD;
mice.,&#xD;
"Lost! lost!  Johnston, without striking a&#xD;
blow, has rolled back the tides of victory. Our&#xD;
weary columns are retreating,"     -&#xD;
'ito officer groaned, and said no more. He&#xD;
&#xD;
asked for neither water nor help. His reeling&#xD;
faculties were grappling with the terrible truth&#xD;
he had heard.&#xD;
" Hope! Hope !" repeated Ralpa.&#xD;
No voice responded to the name. He ran&#xD;
from room to room. Signs of the sad desolation&#xD;
of war met him at every step. I lis search was un-&#xD;
successful. When he returned, Zadoc Murelh was&#xD;
holding a vessel of water to the wounded officer's&#xD;
lips. He was forcibly struck with this instance&#xD;
of the rough man's kindness. While he contem.&#xD;
plated tim with surprise, he j-ut down the ves-&#xD;
sel, adjusted the officer in a more comfortable&#xD;
position, then turning to Girdwood, said:&#xD;
" She isn't hyar. Come along !"&#xD;
Leaving the shattered house, they mounted&#xD;
their horse, and Murch ook the lea,l. As tie&#xD;
were passing some negro huts, Dagon appeared ,&#xD;
but in a notable state of despondnety. he was&#xD;
amazed:at seeing Ralph.&#xD;
" l's 'stonished," he ex'-laimed, " to see ye&#xD;

" I'm looking for your mistress. Have vou&#xD;

" Seen her? Gorry, Mas'r Girdwooa     I's&#xD;

"But your mistress ?"&#xD;
"They looked, for all the world, like great&#xD;

" Well, your mistress ?" insisted Girdwood.&#xD;
"Dar's whar I's in tronble! These yer same&#xD;

The powder-stained lips of Ladoe Mureh re-&#xD;
laxed into a grim smile.&#xD;

Dagon, "and I should like mjghty well to '.O&#xD;

"It is best seen in the night," replied Ralph.&#xD;
"It's not the star of Dixie."&#xD;
" Don' know 'bout that, mas'r.. There's many&#xD;

ban's has struck out for it right through swamps,&#xD;
alligator bayous, across rivers, and through&#xD;
much tribulation.""&#xD;
"You jest let the North Star alone, boy!i" in-&#xD;
terposed Zadoe. " You've got a flat foot, a flat&#xD;
nose, a flat forehead, thick lips, long hands, and&#xD;
ha'r that is wool. You belong, I allow, to a flat&#xD;
race; and the best thing you can do is, to be&#xD;
happy with, hard work and enough to eat' and&#xD;

If 1's your master, I wouldn't have ye, if ye&#xD;
come back never so humble and whimperin'.'&#xD;
Zadoc threw an inquiring look upward through&#xD;
the branches of the trees at the smoky sky, and&#xD;
.quickened his pace. Night was drawing on;&#xD;
,but the sounds of strife had not ceased; they&#xD;
reached the earn of the fugitives from various=&#xD;
quarters. The boom of cannon and the burst-&#xD;
ing of shells were.ever and anon audible.&#xD;
Zadoe bore away across the country, keeping&#xD;
in the. woods as much as possible, and avoiding&#xD;
the open fields. They had not proceeded far&#xD;
in this manner, when they found themselves&#xD;
near, the skirmishers of Johnston's flanking&#xD;
column, and were obliged to pause in - their,&#xD;
flight.-&#xD;
Squads of the Black Horse Cavalry which&#xD;
had not yet been in action, were seen hurry-&#xD;
ing toward Centreville. Their position was now&#xD;
extremely precarious. Thsey could neither tu'n&#xD;
back nor go forward.   Girdwood looked at&#xD;
Zadoc with painful'perplexity. .&#xD;
"Our embarrassment," lie rNnarked, "in-&#xD;
creases at every step."&#xD;
If you'll leave the gal, you can git out o'&#xD;
&#xD;
this hyar," answered Zadoe,- glancing queerly&#xD;
at Hope.&#xD;
"Itis not to be thought of!" returned Gird-&#xD;
wood, quickly and curtly.&#xD;
"You see, squire, that men-critters can go&#xD;
where women-eritters can't, on account 9 their&#xD;
clothes and their daintiness.' Gal's flesh is as&#xD;
tender as a young partridge. The brush and&#xD;
bushes of swamps and wools tears their plum.&#xD;
age to bits in scurcely no time."&#xD;
" Whatever comes of it, I remain with Miss&#xD;
Hurdlestone," said Ralph, firmly.&#xD;
"Save yourself!" exclaimed Hope. "My&#xD;
arigcr is' not comparable to yours. As the&#xD;
daughteg of Colonel TIlurdlestone, ,I am  safe&#xD;
.With the Coifederates ; although I confess it&#xD;
will be a severe disappointment f I cannot join&#xD;
my father, and lighten his captivity. by my&#xD;
presence. Reflect, Mr. Girdi'ood, on the fait&#xD;
your re-ci'ture involves."&#xD;
Miss llurdlestone spoke with much animaa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
" I shall not desert you while thought worthy&#xD;
by you to be trusted with the care of your per-&#xD;
son."  Then to Zadoc:-. "Come, Mr. Morch,&#xD;
secure us a present hiding-place. Sur ly you&#xD;
arek acquainted with this portion of the coua-&#xD;
try."&#xD;
"Look 'e hyar ! Keep that pup in, Dragon !"&#xD;
said Zadoe, with a warning motion to Dagon.&#xD;
"Can't have that pup seoutin' aroun'. Keep&#xD;
her clost under your nose, or you'll never see&#xD;
the North Star till your ha'r is whiter nor your&#xD;
ivories. Come on,- white folks ! I'm a strong&#xD;
tea, I' be, with bitterness for the mouth, and&#xD;
sickness for the head. Good for all sorts o'&#xD;
complaints, this wildcat is. I'm a extract of&#xD;

Texas, and the border, is b'iled into me."&#xD;
Murcli seemed infinitely relieved by this out.&#xD;
burst, and turned' his horse's head toward the&#xD;
darkest recesses of the forest, while the Confed-&#xD;
erates were heard sweeping through the glades&#xD;
on eitherside. Advancing to where the trees&#xD;
stood more closely, and the foliage was more&#xD;
eonipact, he dismounted and led his dark and&#xD;
glossy steed by the bridle.&#xD;
" Softly, youngster, softly !" admonished Za-&#xD;
doe. "Pay a leetle attention to your stepping'&#xD;
as well as to. the, gal. Dry sticks '11 break, if&#xD;
you tread on 'em rough."&#xD;
Girdwood blushed consciously, while Hope&#xD;
smiled at the quaintness of their guide.&#xD;
It now grew suddenly dark. They had enter-&#xD;
ed a swampy dingle so,dense with folliage, that&#xD;
it well nigh shut out the light of day. Even&#xD;
this secluded spot had been visited by destrue&#xD;
tive missiles, for the young man stumbled over&#xD;
a round shot, and anon tripped on a fragment&#xD;
of shell.&#xD;
"Big Union gun !" said Zadoc, explanatorily,&#xD;

softly.&#xD;

Hope's voice was low and gentle. Her eyes,&#xD;
which were upturned a moment, fell modestly&#xD;
beneath the drooping lashes. ,&#xD;
Girdwood pressed the imprisoned hand to his&#xD;
lips. His blood was in a pleasing commotion.&#xD;

A  breast, with-sullen pride.&#xD;
Nay, father, we are one in all but this mad-&#xD;
,. e of rebellion," answered Hope, with touch-&#xD;
nf  ;,n fderness.&#xD;
kladness: Who dares call it madness?!' he&#xD;
rutrted, slaking her off, for she had laid a gen-&#xD;
Lie rand on his shoulder.&#xD;
--Call it what you will ; I will not gainsay.&#xD;
But I think I know how it will end."&#xD;
&#xD;
Hurdlestone turned slowly upon Girdwood.&#xD;
" So, sir I" he began. "This is the way you&#xD;
protect my daughter. This comes of your umag-&#xD;
nanimity in seeking her after the battle."&#xD;
"Your reproaehes, sir, have some point of&#xD;
justice ; yet I swear to you ,that what I have&#xD;
said was upremeditated," answered Ralph.&#xD;
" Unpremeditated !" sneered  the colonel.&#xD;
"The worst of criminals might- plead that ex-&#xD;
cuse in extenuation of crime. It was for this&#xD;
you sought my daughter, and decoyed her foot-&#xD;
steps hither !"&#xD;
" Colonel Hurdlestone, I must beg of you to&#xD;
use no language that a man of honor may not&#xD;
hear without offence," returned Ralph, with&#xD;
dignity. "If Miss Hurdlestone has received a&#xD;
disrespectful word or look from me, I will not&#xD;
evade the responsibility, but hold myself ac-&#xD;
countable for the same."&#xD;
" Most kind ! Most considerate I" murmured&#xD;
Hope.&#xD;
" Too kind-too considerate !" vociferated the&#xD;
colonel. "It is this kindness and consideration,&#xD;
as you daintily term it, that I complain of. A&#xD;
fine time, girl, for love-making, when your father&#xD;
ws a prisoner, and your native soil overraun&#xD;
with Federal hireling-hordes!"&#xD;
" While regretting and deprecating your an-&#xD;
ger, I rejoice at your escape," observed Gird-&#xD;
wood.&#xD;
" Young nnan, the best advice I can give you&#xD;
is, to follow the retreating rabble of the Wash-&#xD;
ington Army. As for my daughter, the pater-&#xD;
nal aim, I trust, will be found sufficient to pro.&#xD;
tect her. Be wise, and return no more to Ma-&#xD;
nassas. Should you unhappily disregard this&#xD;
injunction, the reward you have earned will be&#xD;
rigorously meted out to you. I go to join my&#xD;
friends of the victorious army. Come, girl--&#xD;
minion-ingrate ! Follow me p'"&#xD;
.Hurdlestone looked at his daughter as if he&#xD;
expected and exacted obedience.&#xD;
Girdwood stoodconfounded and wondering.&#xD;
The man whom he had believed a prisoner&#xD;
on his way to Arlington was before him, to&#xD;
dampen the first glow of his feelings, rob him&#xD;
of Hope, and baffle his plan. An emotion of&#xD;
rushing disappointment came upon him. The&#xD;
light no longer crept through the drift of smoky&#xD;
clouds. Darkness rolled in upon the dingle.&#xD;
The metaphor of Hope had, apparently, lost its&#xD;
meaning. The silver lining had departed.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
LOO    'E HitAR!&#xD;
The dark-green leaves fluttered and rustled in&#xD;
the stillness. A puff of hot and stifling air swept&#xD;
down from the b tattle-field. For a moment it&#xD;
seemed to Girdwood that the earth was reeling&#xD;
under his feet.&#xD;
" Follow m !" repeated the colonel. " As for&#xD;
you, sir," he added, with a stern glance at Ralph.&#xD;

A&#xD;
4&#xD;
fY&#xD;
k&#xD;
Y&#xD;
v&#xD;
&#xD;
as for you, sir, misguided young man, escape&#xD;
while you may."&#xD;
He turned slowly to go, and Hope made a&#xD;
step forward.&#xD;
"Look 'c hyar !"&#xD;
The parties started, as if simultaneously&#xD;
thrilled by a shock of magnetism. Moving&#xD;
from beneath the foliage that drooped over the&#xD;
camp, the short, stout personality of Zadoo&#xD;
Murch advanced quietly and laid his hand on&#xD;
Hurdlestone's shoulder.&#xD;
"Look 'e hyar !"&#xD;
Never before had Girdwood heard this singu-&#xD;
lar man throw so much meaning into these&#xD;
words.-&#xD;
" You here !" exclaimed the colonel.'&#xD;
" I'm hyar !" said Murch, gruffly.&#xD;
" Well ?" queried Hurdlestone, curtly.&#xD;
" I allow that you're a prisoner," said Mureb,&#xD;
ungraciously.&#xD;
" Not long since I was a prisoner, but now I&#xD;
am free," answered the colonel, with a flush o&#xD;
pride and conscious strength.&#xD;
"Did ye give your peril of honor ?" asked&#xD;
Zadoc, with increasing amoiguity of manner.&#xD;
" Not I! I gave a few lusty blows and the&#xD;
spurs to, niy horse and you see me here," re-&#xD;
sponded Hurdlestone, who prided himself on his&#xD;
prowess. " Hope, take moy arm," he added.&#xD;
" You're hyar, but not free," continued&#xD;
Murch.&#xD;
" What do you mean, sir?" cried Hurdlestone,&#xD;
angrily. "I don't comprehend your bearing,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
There was a stir of feet on the dry leaves.&#xD;
Hurdlestone felt himself seized by the'legs and&#xD;
shoulders. He shook himself like a rampant&#xD;
horse, but without freeing himself from his un-&#xD;
expected assailants.&#xD;
Girdwood, who perceived the true condition of&#xD;
affairs, saw the fighting brothers clinging about&#xD;
thencolonel's nether limbs, like young anacondas,&#xD;
and Corporal Keith clutching him firmly by&#xD;
the collar.&#xD;
Luke Scotto walked composedly from among&#xD;
the trees into the foreground.&#xD;
" This hyar is my meanin'," said Murch.&#xD;
"Traitor!" hissed Hurdlestone.&#xD;
" I'm the extract of sev'ril States," quoth Za-&#xD;
doe, "and a strong tea for some kinds o' sick-&#xD;
ness. Call me what you will."&#xD;
" Give us the slip, didn't ye, colonel?" said&#xD;
Scotto. "Co'p'ril Keith, you ain't the man I&#xD;
took ye to be."&#xD;
"As we's ridin' along," answered the corporal,&#xD;
" the twins clinched, and I went to separate&#xD;
'em. While I was a uutwistin''em, the prisoner&#xD;
rode down and knocked down the guard, and&#xD;
streaked it. I cut arter him, and here he is." ~-&#xD;
" Stop shakin' him ! What's into ye, co'p'ril?&#xD;
You've got him, theerfore be quiet. Colonel,&#xD;
don't be rampageous. Submit like a man. The&#xD;
thing's agin ye, and you can't help it. There's&#xD;
&#xD;
a squad o' the star-spangled er'tters within call,"&#xD;
said the scout, with that easy self-composure&#xD;
that characterized-him.&#xD;
" You speak truly," responded Hurdlestone,&#xD;
with gloomy grandeur. "Fate orders it. CUil&#xD;
off these curs, and I give you my word that I&#xD;
will make no attempt to escape, unless rescued&#xD;
by my friends."&#xD;
"You do well," returned the scout. " Your&#xD;
word is taken, although- one who has proved&#xD;
false to the flag mayn't be fully trusted. Doe t&#xD;
flush up, colonel, for I say it, as 'twere, in sor-&#xD;
row."&#xD;
," You know the fortunes of the day, I sup&#xD;
pose ?" interrogated the prisoner, with a smile&#xD;
that could not be mistaken.&#xD;
" Repulsed, but not beaten. It brings you no&#xD;
nearer the eend, and only lengthens the war.&#xD;
Your masked battery, login victory, avails n-&#xD;
what, for 'tisn't follered up by Beauregard. Our&#xD;
troops '11 reach their old campin'-ground in safe-&#xD;
ty ; and carter this the army '11 be made over:id&#xD;
perpar d to put down this p'ison rebellion. TIs&#xD;
'Il wake up and open the eyes of Gover'nweiit&#xD;
and People."&#xD;
The righteousness and greatness of hiseaiuse&#xD;
shed a notable dignity over the features of Luke&#xD;
Scotto. Ilurdlcstone looked at him and in\ol-&#xD;
untarily sighed. Possibly a thought of Wash-&#xD;
ing~tn, the Revolution, and the heritage of fre-&#xD;
dom, left a mournful, regretful track along toe&#xD;
road of memory.&#xD;
"Had you brought the whole North down to&#xD;
Manassas," he said, presently, with an obvious&#xD;
effort to shake off his depression, " we shom d&#xD;
have whipped you."&#xD;
" You bought, and then ag'in you moughtn't:"&#xD;
returned Scotto, with composure. " Let s be&#xD;
movin'," he added, "for the remnant of the&#xD;
Black Boss is ragin' up and down, s'archin' f r&#xD;

" Where's that trai' or and villain ?" asked&#xD;
Hurdlestone, glancing about. for Mureb. But&#xD;
Zadoc had mysteriously disappeared. and the&#xD;
colonel was left in doubt respecting his charae-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
The parties followed Scotto a few rods, and&#xD;
found, farther up in the dingle, a dozen of the&#xD;
Independent Rangers waiting the coning of&#xD;
their leader.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
SCOTTO AND THE REnEL LEADER.&#xD;
"Well, captain, what's to be done ?" asked&#xD;
one of the men. " The rebels seem to be pre ty&#xD;
plenty hereabouts. I can hear them stirring on&#xD;
both sides of us."&#xD;
" Dismount, lads, and let your h rses bre the&#xD;

look favorable. With women folks along "-he&#xD;
looked at Hope-"'twould be foolish to show&#xD;
ourselves unnecessarily to the rebels."&#xD;
66I know," he went on, reflectively, " that we&#xD;
might hack, hew, and slew, peradventur'," but&#xD;
the dainty body of the young woman ain't bul-&#xD;
.t-proof; theerfore we must conduct ourselves&#xD;
oeorlin'."&#xD;
"Let me refresh your memory," said Hurdle-&#xD;
stone to the scout, as he was moving away.&#xD;
"If there is an attempt at rescue by my com-&#xD;
panion--in-arms, I shall not remain passive."&#xD;
"1I understand , sir," returned Scotto, coldly.&#xD;
" In that event, your word isn't pledged to stay&#xD;
with us any longer nor we can keep ye. South-&#xD;
ern honor mustn't be tarnished, I reckin I"&#xD;
Luke Scotto shrugged his shoulders, and there&#xD;
was, a quiet sarcasm in his voice that was suf-&#xD;
filecntly obvious. Then to his followers:&#xD;
"Men, take good care of the prisoner." With&#xD;
this parting -injunction Scotto walked away, and&#xD;
was soon hidden from view by the trees. He&#xD;
passed from the dingle on that side commanding&#xD;
the best view of the battle-field. Climbing a&#xD;
sharp eminence, be strained his eyes in the di-&#xD;
rection of Centreville and -Warrenton Road.&#xD;
But the shadows of evening lay like a dim man-&#xD;
tte over the scene. Here and there lights were&#xD;
flashing, like faint and erratiemeteors. Already&#xD;
had anxious friends gone forth to search for fa-&#xD;
miliar faces among the dead and wounded. It&#xD;
was the old, sad, and often-enacted afterpiece of&#xD;
battles. He could hear the sound of hurrying&#xD;
feet, as squads of horsemen swept to and fro&#xD;
from various quarters. Beneath the hazy cano-&#xD;
py, scarcely distinguishable from other objects,&#xD;
lie caught phantom glimpses of fragments of in-&#xD;
fantry, flitting and fluctuating like the billows&#xD;
of a disturbed sea. Borne on the passing breeze,&#xD;
the low and melancholy wail of the wounded came&#xD;
to his ears. He had heard that mournful music&#xD;
before. He had grown acquainted with it in&#xD;
bloody raids of the border, and on the red fields&#xD;
of Mexico.&#xD;
" They wanted war," said Luke, speaking&#xD;
aloud, " and they've got it. We've got the&#xD;
worst on't this time, but the next time the Union&#xD;
banners move toward Manassas, they won't float&#xD;
over an armed mob."&#xD;
The sharp' clang of iron hoofs startled Scotto,&#xD;
and out short his soliloquy. A horseman spur-&#xD;
red up the ascent. Scotto prudently stepped&#xD;
behind a sturdy oak, while the headlong rider,&#xD;
reaching the summit of the eminence, paused to&#xD;
breathe his panting steed. Giving a slack rein&#xD;
to the reeking animal, the rider endeavored to,&#xD;
separate the realities before him from the pre-&#xD;
vailing shadows. He seemed exultant, yet&#xD;
doubtful and perplexed.&#xD;
"They'll make a stand at Centreville," he&#xD;
muttered. "Surely, they don't mean to run to&#xD;
Washington. This must he a ruse to draw us&#xD;
on. Johnston hesitates. He fears to hurl his&#xD;
&#xD;
forces against them. Accursed darkness that&#xD;
covers both friend and foe !"&#xD;
The horseman bent over his horse's mane,&#xD;
and looked with the utmost intensity. He saw&#xD;
the same objects that Scotto had seen, but with&#xD;
far different feelings.&#xD;
"Victory! victory !" he added. "The old&#xD;
flag flies! My name shall live in history. Be'&#xD;
fore me are power and dominion ! The Great&#xD;
Republic is dead !"&#xD;
" Touton Beauregard !" said a stern yet steady&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
The horseman gathered up the flowing rein&#xD;
and turned quickly toward the person who had&#xD;
thus addressed him. He beheld Luke Scotto,&#xD;
with the barrel of his cocked rifle resting in the&#xD;
hollow of his left arm. The sight, for a mo-&#xD;
ment, paralyzed him. He knew well the man ;&#xD;
his integrity ; his - stern patriotism ; the iron&#xD;
rigidness of his resolves, when once formed&#xD;
The triumph of Manassas, the glory of the&#xD;
hour, .faded away.  The fresh laurels on his&#xD;
brow withered as by the blighting touch of&#xD;
lightning.&#xD;
"Touton Beauregard !"&#xD;
The tones of the scout thrilled to the marrow&#xD;
of his bones.&#xD;
" Luke Scotto !" faltered the victorious gen-&#xD;
eral.&#xD;
" How good is yonr memory !" said Luke,&#xD;
with ominous sang froid. "If you hadn't seen&#xD;
me, you wouldn't knowed me, I reeko. This&#xD;
isn't like Mexico-is it ? We didn't see no flag&#xD;
with seven stars on't down there !"&#xD;
The Confederate officer sat silent in the sad-&#xD;
dle, gazing vacantly at Scotto.&#xD;
"'Tisn't long since you had me at your head-&#xD;
quarters, with your secesh rabble around me,&#xD;
talkin' of halters and spies. My life seemed as&#xD;
nowhat in your eyes. I was a Northern mud-&#xD;
sill, to hang atween the heavens and the airth&#xD;
Now I have you, traitor ! This weepon 'that's&#xD;
leveled on ye, has brought down a man at eigh-&#xD;
ty rods, and, can do the same at a hundred.&#xD;
The muzzle, as I hold the thing careless in my&#xD;
hand, covers your heart. Why should I spare&#xD;
you, Touton Beauregard ?"&#xD;
He paused, standing stiff and stirless as iron.&#xD;
"The world would be better for't," he went&#xD;
on. " No true man would weep, but for your&#xD;
sins. In time to come, when this twenty-first&#xD;
day of July hes passed into history, some at&#xD;
like this mought be found in the record: 'Beau-&#xD;
regard, the rebel general, was shot the evening'&#xD;
arter the battle by Luke Scotto- . man wo&#xD;
sarved his country acordin' to his abilities,&#xD;
without hope of fee or rewirl. His friends&#xD;
buried him in the night, and the grave of the&#xD;
traitor is unknown and unmarked by stone or&#xD;
tributetof affection.'"&#xD;
A breathless silence followed. The distant&#xD;
occasional firing rendered it more impressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
The general's stunned faculties began slowly to&#xD;
react. His blood flowed and glowed again.&#xD;
"It is not my destiny 1" he said, somewhat&#xD;
hoarsely.&#xD;
"You're the Napoleon of the South, I s'pose,&#xD;
theerfore have a star? Don't be misled by&#xD;
stars, Touton. There's but one star worth the&#xD;
nindin', and that's the star of honor. I've&#xD;
heerdof the North Star; but who ever heerd&#xD;
of the South Star ?" answered Scotto, his rifle&#xD;
still turned upon the chieftain.&#xD;
" The Southern Star," returned Beauregard,&#xD;
" is the star of empire."&#xD;
"And it rolls torards the- Gulf!" retorted&#xD;
Luke, with dignity. "It rolls not West'ard nor&#xD;
North'ard. Not by no means! The light of&#xD;
your star will be quenched in the waters of the&#xD;
Gulf o' Mexico."&#xD;
" The fanaticism of the North !" sneered&#xD;
Beauregard, whose only hope was to engage the&#xD;
scout in conversation, and watch for the favor-&#xD;
able moment of escape. He had reason to be-&#xD;
lieve that his friends were not far distant. They,&#xD;
might come up; his stern captor might be&#xD;
thrown off his guard, or something to his ad-&#xD;
vantage might in some way happen. He did&#xD;
not abandon hope. He would not and could not&#xD;
perish without tasting the fruits of victory. He&#xD;
-wanted to hear a gaping multitude cry : "There&#xD;
goes the man who defeated the Union Army !"&#xD;
" Fanaticism and zeal are much alike, I allow,"&#xD;
said Scotto. "Without zeal, a man's nowhat.&#xD;
There's nothing' into him to give him energy.&#xD;
But I'll preach you a sarmon at another time ;&#xD;
theerfore, git off that hoss. A prisoner a hoss-&#xD;
back is a prisoner with the advantage of four&#xD;
hoss legs to two man legs."&#xD;
"Luke Scotto," answered Beauregard, with&#xD;
earnestness, "hear me ! As you value rank,&#xD;
and riches, and a name, hear me !" -&#xD;
"Go on, Touton ! Go on, for half a minute,"&#xD;
responded Scotto, still standing firm and straight&#xD;
and unbending in his simple integrity.&#xD;
" Go with me, Luke Scotto. Yield your ad-&#xD;
vantage. Trust your future fortunes in my&#xD;
hands."&#xD;
He spoke rapidly and with emphasis.&#xD;
"To what end ?" asked Luke.&#xD;
" To the end of riches and rank. Look at&#xD;
me ! I am fresh from the battle-field. I am&#xD;
flushed with my first great victory !" -&#xD;
The voice of the rebel chief might have mov-&#xD;
ed one whose loyalty was less.&#xD;
"If you was flushed with a thousand victor-&#xD;
les, 'twould be the same !" replied Luke, with-&#xD;
out the slightest sign of relenting.&#xD;
" To go with-you, is to go to the halter,",con-&#xD;
tinued Beauregard. "A prisoner to t'he Fed.&#xD;
erals I will never be. A rifle-ball would be far&#xD;
more friendly and welcome than such a fate.&#xD;
No! no! that may never be. As I said, you&#xD;
have me at an advantage ; but tell me the price&#xD;
of this advantage, and I give you my word of&#xD;
&#xD;
honor as a man and a soldier, that it shall be&#xD;
paid to the last farthing."&#xD;
" Tempt me not ! Tempt me not, for I bear&#xD;
you no good will," answered Scotto. ",Give&#xD;
me all the Confederate bonds, all the Confeder-&#xD;
ate cotton, all the Confederate niggers, and all&#xD;
the Confederate gold, and I wouldn't let you go&#xD;
of my own will!"&#xD;
The scout, in the pale moonlight, looked&#xD;
really sublime. His rude eloquence smote the&#xD;
heart of Beauregard more than the sound of&#xD;
the Federal cannon he had heard that day. His&#xD;
brave words gave manhood and beauty to his&#xD;
character.&#xD;
"I believe in my destiny !" muttered Beaure-&#xD;
gard, watching the dark barrel of the rifle, re-&#xD;
solved to strike the spurs deeply into his horse&#xD;
and dare the menacing bullet. Had any other&#xD;
hand held the weapon, his fears for the result&#xD;
would have been infinitely less ; but the quick&#xD;
eye, steady arm, and sure finger of the scout,&#xD;
rendered the trial no ordina-y risk. He was&#xD;
about to lance the reeking. sides of the animal,&#xD;
when the leveled rifle was suddenly struck up.&#xD;
ward by another hand, and the contents were&#xD;
discharged in the air, and, to his joy, the Con-&#xD;
federate officer perceived the well-known form&#xD;
of Zadoe Murch. ., Ie spurred to aid him, ex-&#xD;
claiming, as he drew and presented a pistol at&#xD;
Luke:&#xD;
" Die, obstinate villain !"&#xD;
"Nary die !" cried Zadoe, interposing his&#xD;
burly body between the pistol and Scotto. "Pat&#xD;
up that weepon, B'uregard."&#xD;
"Nay, but the rascal would have shut me 1"&#xD;
remonstrated the general, provoked at the in-&#xD;
terference.&#xD;
" Look 'e hyar !" retorted Murch. "I saved&#xD;
your life.&#xD;
" And it may cost ye some'at, too," muttered:&#xD;
the scout, leaning moodily on his empty rifle..&#xD;
" No matter why I saved your life, but I say.&#xD;
ed it," continued Murch. "Prehaps 'twas be-&#xD;
cause you saved me from bein' hacked to lits&#xD;
in a row down at the Run-; and prehaps 'twasn't.&#xD;
Who keers? Be that howsomever it may, this&#xD;
man mustn't be etched. He's got the true-grit.&#xD;
in him, he has. ~ When a man's got the true grit,&#xD;
I don't mind wlar I find him, nor which side&#xD;
he's on. I stick to him, I do !"&#xD;
" You are a strange fellow !" said Beaure-&#xD;
gard, reluctantly returning his pistol to the&#xD;
holster.  "You must have your ows way, I&#xD;
suppose. I owe you something for-your-time-&#xD;
ly interference. A victorious leadenshould not&#xD;
die on the day of victory. Come;: will you go-&#xD;
with me, or shall I leave you in such question-&#xD;

"Go your way, gin'ral. Look arter that Star&#xD;

mentioning . I trust when I see you ag'in, it&#xD;

her way back ; but when she had walked a half-&#xD;
hour, she was surprised that she had not accom-&#xD;
plished her purpose. She kept on, till the con.&#xD;
viction that she had lost her way'stole gradually&#xD;
upon her.&#xD;
When she emerged from the woods, it was a&#xD;
place unknown to her, but a portion of the thea-&#xD;
tre of the day's events, for it was marked by the&#xD;
red track of battle. She believed that she was&#xD;
far from the farm-house, and was surprised at&#xD;
the long stretch of ground that had been occu-&#xD;
pied by the hostile armies.&#xD;
Treading with timid steps, she passed many&#xD;
mementoes of the fight. She thought she had&#xD;
not courage to look upon the victims of war ;&#xD;
but when she saw the motionless sleepers, it&#xD;
was with more of solemnity than fear. It was&#xD;
not without feelings of patriotic sublimity that'&#xD;
she saw the Union dead in their last, quiet slum-&#xD;
bers. She reflected that they had fallen- in a&#xD;
good cause, and that the private who had yield-&#xD;
ed his life for the beloved flag was as much a&#xD;
hero as the gallant officer who had died, sword&#xD;
in hand, at the head of his column.&#xD;
Such sensations and deductions were whole-&#xD;
some ; they disarmed her foolish, selfish terrors,&#xD;
and directed her mind to higher moral lessons&#xD;
and nobler objects.&#xD;
The pale and eternal orbs of heaven poured&#xD;
down upon her innocent and undefended head a&#xD;
pure atmosphere of mild and softened light-a&#xD;
snowy illumination that also fell upon the white&#xD;
faces-of the slain. Federal and Confederate lay&#xD;
side by side. Mothers and wives would ev cep&#xD;
over both. Liberty and Slavery had its martyrs&#xD;
there. The God of Battles sat in His majesty&#xD;
-er all&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
THE VITANDIERE.&#xD;
Hope moved on. She knew that she was&#xD;
astray, but she felt protected and guided. A&#xD;
low sobbing reached her ears. It did not startle&#xD;
her much ; she was expecting sounds of grief&#xD;
and pain ; it was the place and the hour for&#xD;
them. Looking onward, she beheld a figure&#xD;
seated beside a heap of slain men. It was a fe-&#xD;
male form, and the presence of the dead gave.&#xD;
her a peculiar sanctity in the eyes of Hope, who&#xD;
approached her without hesitation.&#xD;
She was a young woman of eighteen or twen-&#xD;
ty years, with a pretty, childish face, and clad&#xD;
in the picturesque costume of a French vivan-&#xD;
diere.&#xD;
Miss Hurdlestone's light step at once drew her&#xD;
attention. She arose quickly, and the former&#xD;
perceived that she held a pistol in one of her&#xD;
small hands. Seeing that it was one of her own&#xD;
sex who had disturbed her sad and solitary vigil,&#xD;
she manifested both surprise and pleasure, and&#xD;
returned the dangerous little weapon to its&#xD;
pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
" You followed the Federal Army ?" said&#xD;
Hope, affected almost to tears.'&#xD;
" I wear the red, white, and blue !" answered&#xD;
the vivandiere, in a melancholy voice.&#xD;
Hope now observed that her cassock or frock'&#xD;
was made of those united colors.&#xD;
" Why do you weep?" Hope asked.&#xD;
The vivandiere looked at her inquiringly.&#xD;
" Why do you ask such a question ?" she re-&#xD;
plied, throwing a mournful glance over the&#xD;
field. " You, who are a woman, young, and&#xD;
with a heart in your bosom, should know. Truo&#xD;
men lie here, unburied, slain by their brethren I&#xD;
Who can refrain from weeping? It'has been a&#xD;
dreadful day, miss !"&#xD;
" Terrible, indeed !" sighed Hope. "I trem&#xD;
ble at the thought of the dangers to which you&#xD;
have been exposed, and I shudder at every-&#xD;
thing around me. My good girl, you should&#xD;
have kept out of the red circle of battle."&#xD;
Hope advanced and took the passive hand of&#xD;
the vivandiere, whose fair face expressed both&#xD;
sorrow and courage&#xD;
" Think of the poor soldiers," murmured tho&#xD;
girl, " fainting with heat and thirst ! Think of&#xD;
the wounded, too, dying for water ! Is it not a&#xD;
work of duty, as well as mercy, to place the&#xD;
drinking-cup to their hot lips ?" The vivan-&#xD;
diere touched the canteen that hung at her side.&#xD;
Her cheeks glowed with soft melancholy.&#xD;
The silvery moonlight, falling on her young&#xD;
face, seemed like a halo from heaven.&#xD;
"I have received the ' God bless you !' of&#xD;
many a brave soldier to-day," she added. . "I&#xD;
never shall forget what I have seen and heard.&#xD;
Some of the water-carriers have been shot by&#xD;
the enemy. That was cruel; for civilized men&#xD;
do not fire at women. You found me weeping,&#xD;
because it is a day of disaster. A dearly-bought&#xD;
victory was strangely lost. Cameron, and many&#xD;
gallant officers and men, lie dead. I cry with&#xD;
grief and anger!"&#xD;
"Tears, my'girl, will not recall them," said&#xD;
Hope, soothingly.&#xD;
" You have questioned me ; now let me ques-&#xD;
tion you," responded the girl, beginning to ex-&#xD;
amine Hope with more interest. "You, too, are&#xD;
young," she went on ; "as young as I, for my&#xD;
half-masculine dress makes me look more youth-&#xD;
ful than I am. Why, then, are you here ? Are&#xD;
you loyal ?"&#xD;
" As yourself, young woman !"&#xD;
" That gives me joy ! It is pleasant to see a&#xD;
loyal face in a scene like this: Perhaps -you&#xD;
have come to look for a brother or lover ?"&#xD;
" Neither, neither I" answered Hope, quickly.&#xD;
" My father is a rebel officer. He led the Black&#xD;
Horse wherever the battle raged."&#xD;
"Then you may look for his body away yon-&#xD;
der, for I know well the spot where the Black&#xD;
Cavalry were cut to pieces. Come, my friend,&#xD;
I will go with you, if.you wish. I have pity for&#xD;
all."&#xD;

&#xD;
The vivandiere pressed Hope's hand affection-&#xD;
ately.&#xD;
" I thank you, but there is no need. My fatli-&#xD;
or lives. Let us leave this sad place. Tell.me&#xD;
your name."&#xD;
" Margaret Moore. They call me Maggie. I&#xD;
followed the Seventy-ninth. But when I found&#xD;
one moaning for water, I did not ask to what&#xD;
regiment he belonged, or whether he were friend&#xD;
or foe. More than one rebel has drank from my&#xD;
canteen," replied the vivandiere.&#xD;
" I doubt it not, my friend.' Loyal hearts are&#xD;
ever merciful. I am sure we understand each&#xD;
other. Let us be friends. My name is Hope&#xD;
Hurdlestone."&#xD;
" The daughter of Colonel Hurdlestone !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Margaret. "lHe fought bravely. Isaw&#xD;
him sweeping to and fro, with empty saddles at&#xD;
his right and left. Those who came out alive&#xD;
from the last charge upon the three regiments&#xD;
will have a story to tell."&#xD;
" Speak not of it! Let us somewhere seek&#xD;
shelter and safety. I left friendsnot long ago,&#xD;
but fear that I cannot again find them. You can&#xD;
do no good here, and remaining may expose you&#xD;
to new dangers ; for victory makes bad men&#xD;
brutal."&#xD;
"It you go toward Manassas, no; if toward&#xD;
the Potomac, or iii any direction where we shall&#xD;
be likely to fall in with Union troops, I will go&#xD;
with you gladly," answered Maggie Moore.&#xD;
" There is one," said Hope, with heightened&#xD;
color, " whom I would find, who is no traitor,&#xD;
but whom I left in great danger. I anymin doubt&#xD;
whither to direct my footsteps ; but yonder, I&#xD;
think, should be my way. I have been gently&#xD;
reared, my slightest wish being anticipated and&#xD;
obeyed by willing slaves'; and t4 e vicissitudes&#xD;
of this day have been alike new and strange.&#xD;
But I ought not to murmur, when so many lose&#xD;
life itself for that cause which costs me but fa-&#xD;
tigue and a silly girPs terrors. Your courage&#xD;
arid devotion justly rebuke me."&#xD;
" Your words are very sweet, dear young a-&#xD;
(1y. Maggie Moore fears not toigo with you.&#xD;
Look at this little instrument."&#xD;
. The pretty vivandiere held up her pistol. It&#xD;
was an improved and beautiful pattern, with&#xD;
seven revolving cylinders.&#xD;
- " I can use it well, Miss Hurdlestone. I will&#xD;
not tell you what it has done to-day ; but all&#xD;
things are lawful in self-defence. Look at this&#xD;
small copper canister. It is the load. I thrust&#xD;
it into the empty cylinders in a moment. See&#xD;
how I do it.  'here ! the pistolis loaded. Now&#xD;
that holds seven lives, if well aimed. It requires&#xD;
a steady hand, though. Isn't my hand steady?2&#xD;
Observe me, Miss Hurdlestone."&#xD;
While speaking, Margaret Moore loaded the&#xD;
empty cylinders with the percussion canisters&#xD;
and to prove the firmness of her nerves, held out&#xD;
her arm  and leveled   e pistol as deftly and&#xD;
steadily as a veteran.&#xD;
&#xD;
" So you need not be afraid, Miss Hope. For&#xD;
one or two enemies, you see, I am quite prepar-&#xD;
ed. It's a good thing to know how to defend&#xD;
one's-self. You'might as well be a rag-baby, or&#xD;
a log of wood, as not to have the knowledge and&#xD;
courage to take care of your person. The&#xD;
meanest thing that crawls has the instinct to&#xD;
turn on what turns on it. Non-resistance, among&#xD;
brutes, is foolishness."   1&#xD;
" Very good and very true, to my simple ap-&#xD;
prehension," responded hope, surprised at the&#xD;
philosophy and self-possession of the vivandiere.&#xD;
Margaret had returned the pistol to its ap-&#xD;
propriate pocket, and they were mving away,-&#xD;
mutually pleased with each other, when Hoe&#xD;
discovered two men approaching, whose lawless&#xD;
bearing filled her with alarm. They were dress-&#xD;
ed in the dingy gray of the Confederate Army,&#xD;
but the original color was nearly lost in dirt and&#xD;
tatters ; a fact which the fitful moonlight was&#xD;
sufficient to reveal. Their faces were unshorn,&#xD;
and blotched with red, and (so far as Hope could&#xD;
judge, on their nearer approach) bloated with&#xD;
whisky, and the indices of all that was coarse&#xD;
and revolting in the human character.&#xD;
Such were the observations of Hope as the&#xD;
men' advanced and confronted them. However&#xD;
wanting in tidiness, they had no lack ot arms-&#xD;
their leathern belts being literally crowded with&#xD;
weapons that they had manifestly taken from&#xD;
the slain and wounded. Each stood in a circle&#xD;
of steel made up of pistols and lowie-knives,&#xD;
thrust into their belts promiscuously, as gath-&#xD;
ered from the field.&#xD;
The 'discovery of Hope and Margaret gave&#xD;
them the greatest satisfaction. They leered at&#xD;
each other with a species of frightful faeetious-&#xD;
ness that struck terror to the hearts of the trem:t&#xD;
bling girls.&#xD;
"I say, Peterson' said one.&#xD;
The other, for a suitable response, ducked hs&#xD;
head, put a tawny hand over his mouth. and&#xD;
kicked out behind him with his right foot. This&#xD;
pantomime was intended to express something&#xD;
too good to be believed, and to which words&#xD;
were inadequate.&#xD;
" Peterson !" the fellow repeated.&#xD;
"Go 'long !" said Peterson, now kicking at&#xD;
his comrade in bear-like playfulness.  " Go&#xD;
'long, sweetmeats ! -What's this here ? Don't&#xD;
be afeard, little dears. Don't be an artomt&#xD;
afeard. We a'n't grizzly b ars, I allt'w."&#xD;
Peterson doffed an old fatigue-cap, and made&#xD;
a grotesque bow to Hope and Margaret.&#xD;
" Hang me, old boy, if these a'nt some o' the,&#xD;

Haskins expressed his admiration by adlvane-&#xD;

an oak glade, and were glad to sink upon the&#xD;
grass to rest.  -&#xD;
Casting their eyes upward through the long&#xD;
and'thread-like vista formed by the trees, that&#xD;
stood like sentinels on either side, they beheld&#xD;
the mystic stars, and the mild moon, staggering&#xD;
faintly on its ethereal way. To Hope, the gen-&#xD;
tle orb seemed to shudder at the deeds of men,&#xD;
and hurried on its course, pale and sorrowing.&#xD;
She thought of her fattier and her lover.&#xD;
She wondered how it fared with them, and tried&#xD;
to feel that they were safe. A distant rustling&#xD;
of leaves reached her now too-vigilant ears.&#xD;
Her companion heard the same, but with less&#xD;
alarm, and attributed it to the playful leaps of&#xD;
the ever--restless squirrel. The sounds, howev-&#xD;
er, drew nearer, and became more distimet.&#xD;
" It's a beast of prey !" said Miss Hurdle-&#xD;
stone, in a suppressed voice. " I can hear its&#xD;
long, light bounds."&#xD;
o  It sounds like the running of a strong and&#xD;
agile animal, I confess,'' answered Margaret ;&#xD;
"but it may prove tobe a harmless rabbit, or&#xD;
some poor opossum on a nocturnal ramble."&#xD;
'- I fear it may be something of a fiercer sort,"&#xD;
continued Hope. " It would be so dreadful to&#xD;
be torn ii pieces by a stealthy catamount or&#xD;
prowling wolf ."&#xD;
The animal, whatever it was, whose tread dis-&#xD;
turbed them, occasionally paused, then advanc-&#xD;
ed with greater speed. ,lioth the young women&#xD;
were now thoroughly frightened. The creature&#xD;
was fearfully near. Its bounds were rapidly de-&#xD;
vouring the ground. It reached the glade ; it&#xD;
came down it like an arrow, straight toward&#xD;
them. The vivandiere drew her little pistol, and&#xD;
Hope covered her face. A half-dozen quick&#xD;
bounds, and the fleet-limbed animal was upon&#xD;
them. Hope expected to feel its hot fangs in&#xD;
her flesh, instead of whmichl two soft paws were&#xD;
laid upon her, and the cold nose of the hound&#xD;
Jule was pressed against; her cheek.&#xD;
"Oh " exclaimed Margaret, "it's nothing&#xD;
but a dog ! And it must be yours, for it seems&#xD;
to know you."&#xD;
Hope smiled faintly, and showed to Margaret&#xD;
a very pale face. She returned the joyful ea-&#xD;
resses of the hound with genuine pleasure.&#xD;
"Jule! Good Jule ! I'm glad to see you,&#xD;
Jule !" she said. " Where liave you been ?&#xD;
Why didn't you stay with me ?''&#xD;
Jule wagged her tail and frisked about.&#xD;
" Ai!" added her mistress. "If this crea-&#xD;
ture could speak, what news it might tell me.!&#xD;
Perhaps Dagon is seeking me !"&#xD;
"6Let us follow the dog," suggested Maggie ;&#xD;
a proposition to which the other willingly as-&#xD;
sented.&#xD;
Jule, at first, appeared to have no particular&#xD;
destination, her course being discouragingly er-&#xD;
ratie, pausing often to look up at the face of her&#xD;
mistress and evince her satisfaction. Presently&#xD;
the hound's discretion became more defined,&#xD;
&#xD;
and they followed with increasing confidence&#xD;
'er! actions indicated that she scented some-&#xD;
thing ; and, after going a few rods further, they&#xD;
discovered a man sitting at tie root of a tree.&#xD;
Jule stopped, and eyed the figure with evident&#xD;
doubt and curiosity, while h1u1je aL Margaret&#xD;
shared the irs', if not the latter feeling. On&#xD;
seeing the dog. which was some yards in ad-&#xD;
vance of the young woman, the m:in arose, with&#xD;
a sabre in his baud, and put himself ii a defen-&#xD;
sive- attitud.&#xD;
'-Is it a dog ye le ?" he inquired. in the very&#xD;
voice of Barne  Manie. '"Phrliaps it.s a wild&#xD;
baste ye are ! But you're slim for a dog, be ja-&#xD;
hers ! Iif ye're a cat. say so ; but f ve're a&#xD;
catamount, ist take the -right-hand direction,&#xD;
and I'll give ye t he full of the road."&#xD;
Jule sat down upon her haunches, looked&#xD;
blandly at barmelaid answered never a word.&#xD;
" It's blockadin Iae, ye're afthmr ! Away wid&#xD;
ye, ye brute ! Secade, ye Jong-nosed warmint !"&#xD;
Barney made a hostile motion with his sabre.&#xD;
Just then his eyes fell on the girls.&#xD;
" Howly mother ! What's comm' now.I won-&#xD;
dr.r . Hang me, if iver I see the like of it!&#xD;
Here are two faymale women as true as I'm a&#xD;
good Catholic! They 'pear to be a thritle afeard&#xD;
of me. They're stoppn'-lookin', for all the&#xD;
world, like two partridges hiding' in tihe grass.&#xD;
Bad cesss to me if I don't spake to 'em . 11ey&#xD;
imay be secaders ; but divil a bit cares Paddy&#xD;
Malone -"&#xD;
Barney paused. scratched his head, then drew a&#xD;
dirty fragment of a handkerehief from his locket.&#xD;
" A flag o' truce " quoth Barey.  A flag&#xD;
o' truce is jist the chase. I'll go according to&#xD;
the rigulations of belligerents, bedad"!"&#xD;
Barney clapped the rag oi the point of his&#xD;
sabre, and raised it over his head.&#xD;
" Barrin- the color," lie said," it's as good a&#xD;
flag o' truce. as iver was carried. "i ben, to the&#xD;
girls: "Advance, ye faymales, and we'll ratify&#xD;
tr'aty in the lickin' of a cat's er."&#xD;
" Surrender !" retorted  Margaret. "Lay&#xD;
down your arms and surrender -"&#xD;
" The Sixty-ninth never surrenders! It's like&#xD;
Gin'ral Taylor at Bony Vista !" replied Barney,&#xD;
waving his flag.&#xD;
" W here is the Sixty-ninth ?" asked Margaret.&#xD;
"I'm the Sixty-ninth intirely ! Every divil&#xD;
of 'en, privates, commissioned and non-comr-&#xD;
missioned, officers was jist killed where they&#xD;
stood; so that the Sixty-ninth is myself, and&#xD;
meself alone. I'm colonel, lieutenant-colonel,&#xD;
major, cap'n, lieutenant; ordherly-sergeant, "or-&#xD;
,p'ral, private, and me own quarterimasther.&#xD;
Bad luck to me, it's the qiartermnasther's de-&#xD;
partmint that brings me to grafe ; for sorra a&#xD;
bit of ateables has passed my lips this blissid&#xD;

" Then you are the sole survivor of the Six-&#xD;

tiis intelligence.&#xD;

"That's jist it! You may set it down as Bi-&#xD;
ble truth, every word of it. And this was the&#xD;
fashion of the accident: We wint up to storm a&#xD;
masked-battery of about two hundred rifle-can-&#xD;
non, more or less, as the case may be ; and&#xD;
very one o' them cannon was double-barreled&#xD;
-a earcumstance I never see before in me life.&#xD;
Well, as we marched up side by side, in illegant&#xD;
order, they let fly at us, and down they all wint&#xD;
but meself. I was shot through various parts&#xD;
of me body, and afther what 'd happened, as&#xD;
ye may well belave, I was in trouble in me&#xD;
mind. I didn't stay only long enough to spike&#xD;
a few guns, afther which I made a mastherly re-&#xD;
trate. It's a sad day. O philliloo I Ochone'&#xD;
Ochone !"&#xD;
"It's a great lie you're telling, Barney Ma-&#xD;
lone !" said the vivandiere, advancing, and show-&#xD;
ing her person more filly.&#xD;
" Who spakes?   What voice is that I hear?&#xD;
What forrom is that I see ? It should be Maggie,&#xD;
of the Seventy-ninth."&#xD;
In his surprise, Barney dropped his flag of&#xD;
truce.&#xD;
"I am the vivandiere who gave you water&#xD;
to-day, when you were carried to the rear in an&#xD;
ambulance," answered Margaret.&#xD;
" Cushla Machree ! It's some kind of a dear&#xD;
that Iknew you was, little dear or vivandiere.&#xD;
It's glad I am to see ye ! Come closter, that I&#xD;
may put my two eyes on .something human.&#xD;
God bless, ye, and the likes of ye, this day !&#xD;
Barney Malone is better for seem' ye, and the&#xD;
other one wid ye ; but I'm hurted bad. and it's&#xD;
not long I can stan' comfortable on me feet ; so,&#xD;
with your l'ave, I'll jist clap meself down ag'in&#xD;
while ye tell mc all about the battlee"&#xD;
" There's nothing to tell, Barney.  Our&#xD;
troops are repulsed-that's all," replied Marga-&#xD;
ret, sighing.&#xD;
" Ochone ! My heart is heavy for it. We'd&#xD;
a thrashed 'em, if they hadn't skulked in the&#xD;
woods, behind breastworks and big guns. Sor-&#xD;
row and grafe be unto 'em! Bad whisky and&#xD;
bad. luck to the murtherin' seeaders! May&#xD;
they slape with their eyes open, and wake with&#xD;
'em shut! May they never know the blessin's&#xD;

wather in the sick sliny for the wounded, I re-'&#xD;
vived wonderful, and was crawlin' out of the&#xD;
murchine, when-a shell bu'st under it and&#xD;
whisked me into the air as if I'd been a bundle&#xD;
o' straw. The Mother of God only knows how&#xD;
far I wint up, but in me cooler judgmint, should&#xD;
think about the matter of a thousand feet ! If&#xD;
I hadn't come down in a soft place, it would&#xD;
been the wonder of the world if it hadn't killed&#xD;
rme. Would ye helave it?--the ribels had the&#xD;
haythenness to fire on me when I's in the air!&#xD;
But I had me revinge ; for I fell on a big cap'n&#xD;
and broke his neck. Well, I picked myself up,&#xD;
quite frrehened by the shock, and was doin' me&#xD;

best to stop the retrate, when a frightened pow-&#xD;
der-cart, drawed by six horses running' at the&#xD;
rate of three minutes a mile, fetched me a wipe&#xD;
in the siall of me back, knocked me sprawling ,&#xD;
so that the wheels wint over every part of me&#xD;
body. But that misfortin was the luckiest&#xD;
thing that happened to me during the day; for&#xD;
another shell bu'st, jist then, doin' terrible exe-&#xD;
ention, and covering' me with a hape of slain.&#xD;
Philliloo! There I was, naythur able to move&#xD;
hand nor fut, by r'ason of them atop me. Ah,&#xD;
Miss Maggie, imagine yourself in me place!"&#xD;
" It was very dreadful, Barney," observed&#xD;
Margaret.&#xD;
" Ye may well say that ! God knows it's no&#xD;
lie Im tellin'. But I kept me self-possession&#xD;
wonderful. 'Pull me out,' sez I.&#xD;
"'Pull who out ?' sez somebody else.&#xD;
"' Barney Malone, of the Sixty-ninth,' sez I;&#xD;
And with that, two soldiers got hold of me, and&#xD;
with much pullin' and haulin', suesayded in&#xD;
draggin' me out. Come to look at the liape&#xD;
that was on me, there was about the full of two&#xD;
wagin-loads, in a reasonable estimate. I had&#xD;
now notlhin' for arms but me revoolver, havin'&#xD;
left me musket with two secaders strung on the&#xD;
sabre-bayonet, like a herrin' on a stick. But I&#xD;
might been worse off than havin' six charges at&#xD;
the pullin' of a finger."&#xD;
" You were fortunate in being so well pro-&#xD;
vided for," said Margaret, willing  to listet&#xD;
Barney's adventures.&#xD;
" As things happened, it was the luckiest&#xD;
thing in the world," he resumed ; " for I had no'&#xD;
sooner got on m pins ag'in, than I was in dan-&#xD;
ger of being knocked off 'em by siven of the&#xD;

now, Barney Malone, ye'll never see Bidd&#xD;

that, I grew very stout in tIme heart and the&#xD;

Barney, whose humor had often involved him&#xD;
in difficulty.&#xD;
Zadoc smiled grimly, and the scout, fearful&#xD;
that the friendly relations of the two might be&#xD;
interrupted at the beginning of their acquaint-&#xD;
ance, hastened to say :&#xD;
" Don't bicker, men ! Remember there's&#xD;
women here ; ' theerfore -be quiet."&#xD;
Then to Miss Hurdlestone :&#xD;
"We've been lookin' for ye, miss, a long&#xD;

" Well ?" said ,Hope, uneasily. "Go on, my&#xD;

Scotto, with embarrassment, which he tried to&#xD;
conceal by glancing at Margaret, and remark-&#xD;
ing : " You're one o' them vivandere, I see ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Margaret, mechanically.&#xD;
"Captain Scotto," exclaimed Hope, " you do&#xD;
not speak frankly ! There is something you&#xD;
fear to tell me."&#xD;
" Nothing' more than one might expect in these&#xD;
times. The colonel, your father, was wounded&#xD;
some'at in the squirmish this evenin'," replied&#xD;
the scout, avoiding the questioning eyes of Miss&#xD;
Hu'rdlestone.&#xD;
" Wounded 1" she repeated, while a sad, sick&#xD;
sensation swept over her.&#xD;
"It may be but slightly," said Maggie, sooth-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
" In battle, all men are mortal," said the&#xD;
scout.&#xD;
" Lead me to him at once !" cried Hope, in a&#xD;
decided voice. " You fear- to tell me that hisr&#xD;
Wound is mortal. I must hurry to him to heat'&#xD;
his last wishes, and receive his dying benedie-&#xD;

They reached, presently, the' gshir w hwc a&#xD;

closed,- and- lie was breathing quietly.  ihe&#xD;
grasped his hand, and was startled at its colM-&#xD;

" Father t father !" she exclaimed.&#xD;
The wounded man opened his eyes. His foil-&#xD;
ing sight fixed itself on the features of his&#xD;
daughter. That pale and beautiful countenanee&#xD;
recalled to his recollection a teeming, touching&#xD;
history of many years. He did not speak at&#xD;
first ; thought was too busy with him fir it-&#xD;
terance.&#xD;
"Do you not know me, father ?"&#xD;
"Know you, child ? I know you n w, and&#xD;
