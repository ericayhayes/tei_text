suit of this object t at we entleat the reader to suppose the back-&#xD;
ward curtain with rawn, unveiling, if only for a. moment, the&#xD;
aspects of a perio not so remote as to lie wholly beyond our&#xD;
sympathies. We propose to look back to that dawn of' the six-&#xD;
teenth century; at all events, to such a portion of the historical&#xD;
landscape of that eriod, as to show us some of the first sunny&#xD;
gleams of Europe n ligl'~t upon the savage dominions of the&#xD;
Western Conti.nen. To ~'eview this epoch is, in fact, to survey&#xD;
the small but im re~sive beginnings of a wondrous drama in&#xD;
which we, ourselves , are s ill living actors. The scene is almost&#xD;
within our grasp. The ames of the persons of our narrative&#xD;
have not yet cease from sounding in our ears; and the theatre&#xD;
of performance is c~ 'ic, the boards of which, even at this moment,&#xD;
are echoing beneal~h th&amp;amp; mighty footsteps. Our curiosity and&#xD;
ijiterest may well l~e awa ened for awhile, to an action, the fruits&#xD;
of which, in some egree, re inuring to our present benefit.&#xD;
It is just three h ndred years, since, in the spring season of the&#xD;
year of Grace, on thous nd five hundred and thirty-eight, the&#xD;
infant city of Hay na re wounded with the tread of one of the&#xD;
noblest bodies of S anish rivalry that ever ~et foot in our West-&#xD;
ern hemisphere. - at g y and gallant cavalierr, Hernando De&#xD;
Soto-equally the ourtie and the soldier-having won wealth,&#xD;
no less than fame,~ under Francis Pizarro in Peru, had now re-&#xD;
solved upon an ind~pende t enterprise, in another region, for him-&#xD;
self. This enterprise, in the extravagant expectations of that&#xD;
peri&amp;amp;T; promised tL be o~ even n~ore magnificent results than&#xD;
those of his grea predecessor and companion, already distin-&#xD;
guished by his soy reign ~s the Adelantado of Florida.&#xD;
Florida-that ondro s terra incognita, which, for so long a&#xD;
time, led the Euro ean' agination astray-our ambitious cava-&#xD;
lier, was ~iow busi d in making the grandest preparations for its&#xD;
oonque~t. A. tho sand soldiers, many of whom were of the&#xD;

and thus it was that he bri~f interval during which our adven-&#xD;
turers lingered in the ~sland, after reaching it from Spain, passed&#xD;
like a dream of encha~rtment-one of those fairy tales of pleasure&#xD;
that '~e read of in tl~e romances of Arabia. But the time was&#xD;
fast approaching wher~ these gay scenes of pleasure-the relaxa-&#xD;
tions and the mimicry of war-were to give place to its absolute&#xD;
and hard realities. ~e arrangements oP our adelantado were at&#xD;
length nearly completed. The ships had taken in most of their&#xD;
stores, and two of t~em had been already dispatched with the&#xD;
view to a better exploration of the coast of Florida, and in search&#xD;
of a fitting harbor foi~ the dc~scent of The armament. But a few&#xD;
weeks-perhaps day~~would elapse, and the little city would&#xD;
sink into its ancient dullness and repose. The sad thought of&#xD;
separation from such delights as had been enjoyed by all parties,&#xD;
could only be diss pated by renewed efforts at enjoyment.&#xD;
(~loomy reflections ere o~ily to be banished by fresh indul-&#xD;
gences; and, duly, a the time lessened for delay, the plans and&#xD;
schemes for pleasure were hurriedly increased. The young dam-&#xD;
sels of Cuba put fo th all their attractions to arrest the fugitive&#xD;
hearts whose heroic~ fences had but too much touched their&#xD;
own; and more thar~ one brave cavalier was found to hesitate as&#xD;
the time drew nigh fpr his departure. His imagination painfully&#xD;
contrasted the pleasures which he enjoyed, with the toils and&#xD;
perils which were in prospect. Care and anxiety naturally fol-&#xD;
lowed such comparisons; and, though the sports of the island were&#xD;
not forborne until the armament had fairly taken its departure,&#xD;
yet were they felt t~ be rrjore or less deeply shadowed by the&#xD;
consciousness of the change which was at hand.     ng was&#xD;
growW'g much less ~vely than at first-the tinkle of the guitar&#xD;
less frequent and nierry-'---the voice of the singer more su1~dued,&#xD;

of endowments, of' st4ngth, skill and courage, which were too&#xD;
precious and too conspicuous to be consigned to inactivity. It&#xD;
was a fate that brought him nce more from his native country&#xD;
in search of greater stincti ns than he had yet acquired, in a&#xD;
perilous strife with the fierce natives that occupied the melancholy&#xD;
wastes of Florida.&#xD;
His companion, at t e moThent when we seek to present him&#xD;
to the reader, was a person of a very different mood and charac-*&#xD;
* ter. Don Balthazar d~ Alvar~ was a cold, dark, ~nd somewhat&#xD;
ostentatious hidaIgo,-~a man of passions rather more intense&#xD;
than fierce,-subtle, ye~ tena~ious,-capab1e of secret vices, yet&#xD;
equally capable of c~ncea]liig them,-a prudent man, in the&#xD;
worldly signification of the te4, yet a profligate in every better&#xD;
sense. But he outrag4~d few external proprieties. He had the&#xD;
cunning of the serpent, without the dove~ s innocence, find pos-&#xD;
sessed the art of hiding the fang and venom from discovery, even&#xD;
at the moment when h~ most harbored and prepared both facul-&#xD;
ties for use. He had 1%een for ten years a resident of the island,&#xD;
was a man of large esliates, and larger enterprises, with involve-&#xD;
ments more than cor~esponding with the former, and such as&#xD;
might well be s~uppo~d to follow from a somewhat reckless&#xD;
indulgence of the latt~r.~ He was now forty-five years of age,&#xD;
and remarkably erect ncl vigorous, had frequently distinguished&#xD;
N          himself in war with th Indians, and it surprised nobody in that&#xD;
day that he should ea erly prepare to embark his fortunes with&#xD;
those of Hernando de oto. The pPblic voice imputed to him&#xD;

own, upon which it w~s shrewdly conjectured that her uncle had&#xD;

"Nay; nay; I will not have it so, Don Balthazar," was the&#xD;

10                   VASCONSELO$.&#xD;
when the young cavalier had left the presence, which he did with-&#xD;
otit rendering necessary the commands of his superior, De Soto&#xD;
resumed as follows:&#xD;
"This passeth my lWpe! I had feared a struggle with the hot&#xD;
passions of this youth~ Few men tole~'ate compulsion in aflivirs&#xD;
of love; still fewer the necessity of an alliance with the tl~ing&#xD;
they have dishonored. Strange that we should be so ~heedful of&#xD;
a stain which is of our own making: but verily such is man's&#xD;
nature. That Nuno d~ Tobar is so easy in this matter,-though&#xD;
it likes me as repairing the shame of the Lady Leonora, and re.&#xD;
living me of some of the trouble in my path,-yet somewhat&#xD;
lessens him in my fav~r. He seemeth to me rather heedless on&#xD;
the point of honor."&#xD;
"Nay, your excellei~icy is now unreasonable," was the answer&#xD;
of Don Balthazar; "~uno de Tobar is a philosopher somewhat&#xD;
after my own fashion. He hath made no large calculation upon&#xD;
the sex; therefore he shall not suffer greatly from experience&#xD;
hereafter. Thou wilt ~Io well to suffer him to see noAiminution&#xD;
of thy favor. Hast thou not declared him thy lieutenant-general?&#xD;
Wilt thou revoke thy trust? If thou dost, the offence were more&#xD;
grievous than the co~nmand which weds him to this damsel.&#xD;
That were not so readily forgiven. Tr~ist me, he is one to&#xD;
resent a wrong done t~ his ambition, where he might submit to&#xD;
one inflicted on his he~rt."&#xD;
"It may be so," was De Soto's answer to this suggestion,&#xD;
- "yet I have resolved that he goes no longer as my lieutenant-&#xD;
general. I think of this office for another. It shall certainly be&#xD;
his no longer. He shall win his way to favor ere he gains it.&#xD;
What thickest thou of Vasco Porcallo for this station ?"&#xD;
"Does he join the Axpedition ?" inquired the c~ther.&#xD;
"Will such an app~Antment fail to persuade him to the enter-&#xD;
prise? Such is the bait which I have passed before his eyes."&#xD;
"His treasures are ~n object, surely!"&#xD;
"He is brave also, and full of spirit."&#xD;
"But he is old and capricious! a single skirmish with the red-&#xD;
men will suffice for his ambition."&#xD;

"Go, Philostrate,&#xD;

Turn melancholy forth to fur~eral;&#xD;
The pale companion is not for our pomp."-5HAK5PEAIW.&#xD;
"HAvE you sounded these' Portuguese brothers, as I coun.&#xD;
yelled you'?" was the ~qu~yof De Soto.&#xD;
The brow of Don Balthazar slightly darkened as he answered:&#xD;
"It is not easy to sound them. They are suspicious and re-&#xD;
sentful. The jealousies of our people have made them so; and&#xD;
you have been able to offer them no position. I should have&#xD;
preferred, were this possible, that one of them should have this&#xD;
very office you propose to confer upon Vasco Porcallo."&#xD;
"That is out of the question."&#xD;
"I feel it; and yet, beyond the hope of profit, which is felt&#xD;
by the commonest arquebusier in the army, what is the motive&#xD;
for the enterprise on the part of these brothers'? They are both&#xD;
young and noble-ambitious and full of valor. Their followers&#xD;
are few, it~ is true, but they will make good fight; and really, the&#xD;
abilities of the elder brother, Philip de Vasconselos, are proba-&#xD;
bly of greater valub than those of any of your cavaliers. The&#xD;
companion of De Va9a, he hath traversed all these wilds of Flori-&#xD;
da, and probably knoweth all the secrets of which De Va~a made&#xD;
such glorious boast and mystery Besides, he speaks and un-&#xD;
derstands the language of the natives; an advantage of which it&#xD;
is difficult to measure the importance. Of his valor and con-&#xD;
duct we have sufficient testimony of our own eyes, even if the&#xD;
evidence of other witnesses were wanting; De Va9a himself&#xD;
spoke of him as one of the most prudent and valiant ok his&#xD;

self must willingly incline her ear. We were foes to wisdom /&#xD;
did we refuse to hearken to the words of her best favorite."&#xD;
The stately~compliment, so perfectly Spanish, was from the&#xD;
lips of Don Balthazar, upon whom the lady smiled mos!~&#xD;
sweetly, not wholly insensible, it would seem, to the honeyed&#xD;
flattery.&#xD;
"Now, verily," exclaimed De Soto, who beheld the expres-&#xD;
sion in her face; "now, verily, hath this politician won thy&#xD;
whole heart by the silliest speech. He is like the cunning knave&#xD;
who possesseth counterfeit castellanoes, who, knowing their just&#xD;
worthlessness, yet circulates them for the value which they de-&#xD;
rive only from the ignorance of him who receives. He hath put&#xD;
his copper trinket upon thee, and will look for the golden one in&#xD;
return, even as we look to our Floridian savage fbr the precious&#xD;
metals, in exchange for others, which are as dear to his eyes, as&#xD;
despicable in ours. Is it not so,. my lady? And yet, if thou art&#xD;
thus easily put upon, what shall be my security, leaving the&#xD;
government of Cuba in thy hands?"&#xD;
"Oh! fear nothing, my lord; I shall ere long become schooled&#xD;
in all the subtleties of thy~'politicians, so that thy government&#xD;
shall have fio wrong during thy absence. Be not deceived, my&#xD;
good lord, in the supposed estimate which our sex makes of the&#xD;
flatteries of thine. We receive the coin that thou offerest, not&#xD;
because we overvalue it or esteem it very highly, but simply as&#xD;
we know that it is quite too commonly the most precious which&#xD;
ye have to offer. Were sincerity one of the virtues of the man,&#xD;
we should perhaps never listen to his flatteries; but it were un-&#xD;
reasonable to reject his false tokens, when we know that such&#xD;
constitute his whole treasure; and we receive the tribute of his&#xD;
lips only in the absence of all better securities lodged within his&#xD;
heart. It is something of an acknowledgment, in behalf of our&#xD;
authority, that he is solicitous to show the devotion which he&#xD;
has not always the nobleness to feel."&#xD;

his chamber of council without a summons, she was yet satisfied,&#xD;
from past experience, that her presence in such a place was&#xD;
never wholly unacceptable or unprofitable! When, therefore,&#xD;
she declared her pleasure to remain, unless the topics under&#xD;
discussion should prove ungracious in the hearing of her sex, the&#xD;
ready answer of her husband entreated her to do so, whilst&#xD;
assuring her against the exception which she expressed.&#xD;
"Nay, Isabella," said he; "it particularly concerns thy sex,&#xD;
that of which we are t~ speak, and much of what has been&#xD;
spoken. Know then, in the first place, that thou art to prepare&#xD;
thy lovely handmaid, the damsel Leonora, for her nuptials with&#xD;
Nuno de Tobar."&#xD;
"Thou hast then adjusted that matter '?" said the lady, with a&#xD;
grave accent and demeanor.&#xD;
"It is settled, and without anger or difficulty. It is for thee to&#xD;
decide upon the hour of the bridal. Let it be soon, for we must&#xD;
have dispatch, and advise with the damsel ere the day be sped.&#xD;
But there is yet another matter connected with thy sex which&#xD;
troubles me, and prevents my purpose. Their mischievous influ-&#xD;
ence hath been at work upon my bravest cavaliers. Thou&#xD;
knowest these two ~roung knights of Portugal. I need not tell&#xD;
thee of their w~rth, their valor, and the great importance to the&#xD;
expedition of the elder brother, Philip de Vasconselos, who hath&#xD;
already sped over all the territory of the Floridian, and is fami-&#xD;
liar with the heathen speech of its people. Now, it so happens&#xD;
that these two young gallants grow indifferent to the enterprise.&#xD;
They have held themselves somewhat aloof from me of late, and&#xD;
words have been heard to fall from their lips, which declare their&#xD;
doubts whether they will accompany the expedition, as was their&#xD;
purpose when they joined our armament at Seville."&#xD;
"And canst thou not guess the reason for this change of pur-&#xD;
pose V' demanded the lady, with a smile.&#xD;
"Ay, verily L Thy smile tells me that I am right in ascribing&#xD;
their fickleness of purpose to the persuasions and artifices of thy&#xD;
sex. Our grave Seiior, Don Balthazar de Alvaro, will have it&#xD;

"Deceive not thyself, Se~ior," said the Lady Isabella. "Men&#xD;
are seldom the best. judges of such matters, especially where&#xD;
they are grave senators and busy politicians. You have quite&#xD;
too many concerns to demand your study-tOo many cares of&#xD;
business and fortune to suffer you to give much heed to the ten~.&#xD;
dency of a young and feminine heart. I claim to understand it&#xD;
better, and I tell thee; Sefior, that if ever woman loved cavalier,&#xD;
with all her soul, and with all her strength, then doth Olivia&#xD;
de Alvaro love this elder knight of Portugal, whc~ni they call&#xD;
Philip de Vasconselos."&#xD;
"I believe it not! You are deceived, Lady Isabella. I am&#xD;
sure that such is not the case. But if it were, I should be false to the&#xD;
duties I have undertaken to suffer her indilnations to have sway&#xD;
in this. This Philip de Vasconselos may have his virtues; yet&#xD;
what is he but a b~garly adventurer, who has squandered his&#xD;
birthright in wanderings where the better wisdom has always&#xD;
succeeded in \acquirii~ig it ?"&#xD;
"Not ah~ays, Se~ior, unless old proverbs fall us. The best&#xD;
wisdom is but too commonly the last to secure* the smiles of For..&#xD;
tune. Have not your poets made her feminine, and with twK&#xD;
fold sarcasm made her caprices to resemble ours? Say th~y&#xD;
not, that he is most apt to win her favor who less ~oes for, a~d&#xD;
less deserves it; and shape they not their sarcasm~~in such wi~e&#xD;
as to salve the hurts of self-esteem, by recognizing he propriety&#xD;
of that favor which provides for him who would never be able,&#xD;
of his own wits, to provide for himself?. You shall do no slander&#xD;
to this knight of Portugal, Philip de Vasconselos, who, verily, is&#xD;
a man of thought as well as of valor. I have enjoyed his wis-&#xD;
dom with a rare delight, and if his valor keep any rate of pace&#xD;
with his judgment, he should be a famous leader in ~uch adven-&#xD;
ture as that on which. ye go. For the younger brother, ii can&#xD;
scarcely. speak so favorably. He seemeth at once less wise and&#xD;
more presuming. He speaks as one confident in himself; and I&#xD;
should deem him quite as rash and ill..advised as, valiant ;-nay&#xD;
more, he hath the manner of a man whom small griefs unreason-&#xD;

"And will you that I should encourage a passion which will&#xD;
tend to baffle thy own desires ?" demanded Don Balthazar.&#xD;
"How so,.-What meanest thou ?" was the inquiry of De Soto,&#xD;
who looked the alarm which he really felt.&#xD;
"See'st thou not that the bridal of Philip de Vasconselos with&#xD;
Olivia de Alvaro is conclusive against his progress with the expe-&#xD;
dition'? With her estates in Cuba to occupy his thoughts,-with&#xD;
her wealth in which to luxuriate,-wherefore should he incur the&#xD;
peril of the Floridian enterprise ?"&#xD;
"And wherefore should my lord himself incur such peril, Sefior&#xD;
Balthazar ?" was the quick and ~energetic reply of the lady.&#xD;
"Hath he not estates in Cuba, a government to demand his care,&#xD;
and wealth enough with which to procure all the luxuries of the&#xD;
island? Yet he will leave all these-he will leave me, but lately&#xD;
his newly-wedded bride-and one, I trow, not wholly without hold&#xD;
~upon his heart-and go forth upon adventures of incomparable&#xD;
peril. But this 1~elongs to the passion of a knightly ambition-a&#xD;
generous impatience of the dull paces of the common life ;-an&#xD;
eager and noble appetite after conquest, and the glory which it&#xD;
brings! Of this same temper, seems to me the ambition of this&#xD;
knight of Portugal, who hath been regardless of wealth only as&#xD;
he hath been heedful of honor,-and whose pride it is rather to&#xD;
win a glorious name, than a golden habitation. Thou shalt not&#xD;
disparage this quest, Seiior, since it is one which is ever precious&#xD;
in the sight of :a generous knighthood."&#xD;
"You speak it bravely, my lady; but shall not persuade me&#xD;
that this knight of Portugal would wed my niece only to depart&#xD;
from her. He shall need some time after the nuptials, ere his&#xD;
ambition shall assert itself. His love of distinction will doubt-&#xD;
less bring him after the adelantado-bilt with slow footsteps, and&#xD;
when his lance shall be no longer needful to success."&#xD;
"This is, indeed, a matter to be thought on, Don Balthazar,"&#xD;
was the reply of De Soto, looking gravely, and evidently touched&#xD;

by the suggestion f' the other. "There is sure&#xD;
thou hast spoken. I had not thought of this be&#xD;

"Fruitless !" exclaimed Don Baithazar, with&#xD;

"Now hath Dofia Isabella counselled truly, as hath ever been&#xD;
her wont," said Don Balthazar, eagerly seizing upon a suggestion&#xD;
which promised somewhat, however vaguely, to assist in extri-.&#xD;
cating him from a difficulty which, it was evident to his superior,&#xD;
was one of unusual annoyance.&#xD;
"Both of these brothers," lie continued, "cherish an eager anx-&#xD;
iety for distinction in tilt and tourney. Thus far, they have suf-&#xD;
fered no sports of this character t~ escape them; and one which&#xD;
shall make an event in Cuba long to be remembered with wonder&#xD;
and delight, shall surely reawaken in their bosom all their most&#xD;
earnest appetites for fame. Let them but draw the eyes of all&#xD;
cavaliers upon themselves in this tourney, and they shall scarcely,&#xD;
through very shame, be enabled to escape the necessity of joining&#xD;
in the enterprise.&#xD;
"It shall be done," said De Soto, with the air of a man sud-.&#xD;
defily relieved from his -anxieties. "Thou hast counselled, my&#xD;
lady, with as just a knowledge of our sex and its vanities, as of&#xD;
thine own and its sympathies. And now for the plan f this&#xD;

&#xD;
.--SHRLEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE day was consumed before Don Baltha4r de Alvaro was&#xD;
released from his duties near the person of th~ adelantado. It&#xD;
had been, with the former, a day of protracted~ toil, not without&#xD;
certain accompanying tortures. The tortures,~ however, did not&#xD;
exactly follow from the toil. On the contrary , he could have&#xD;
pursued the former, not only without the slight st feelings of an-&#xD;
noyance or inconvenience, but with an elastic ity and sense of~-&#xD;
satisfaction, the natural consequence of his deep sympathy in the&#xD;
objects of the expedition. His tortures belon ed entirely to a&#xD;
subject, the annoyances of which, to him, were ot by any means&#xD;
suspected by De Soto or his noble lady. Littl did they fancy&#xD;
the deep and peculiar disquiet which Don Balth zar suffered from&#xD;
any allusion to the probability of his niece's ma riage. Had the&#xD;
lover been any other~ than the knight of Portu ak-had he been&#xD;
the most unexceptionable parson in the world the case would&#xD;
not have been altered. He would still have foun a stern hostility&#xD;
in the uncle of the lady, for which no reasons o ordinary policy&#xD;
could possibly account.&#xD;
But Don Balthazar had the strength of will to conceal fronui&#xD;
his superior, as from all others, the degree of ncern which he&#xD;
felt in relation .to this subject. His experience and indurated&#xD;
nature knew well how to clothe itself; exter ally, in the gar-&#xD;
nients of a rugged indifference, or of a pulsele s apathy. But&#xD;
he suffered not the less in secret; and, with the release from the&#xD;
restraints of that companionship throughout th day, which had&#xD;
fettered his secret feelings, th~y broke out in depression of cor-&#xD;

responding force with the pressure that had been laid upon&#xD;
Let us             after a long conference&#xD;
he took his way, at the approach of evening, toward the hr&#xD;
solitude of his own habitation.&#xD;
Thi~s was situated in one of the loneliest, as well as the 1&#xD;
est, of the suburbs of the infant city. The retreat was c&#xD;
which love and ambition might equally delight to meditate&#xD;
one on human sympathies, which are always sweetly asso&#xD;
with the beauty and innocence of nature-the other upon I&#xD;
hope and prospects in the future, which present posse&#xD;
princely and beautiful, might naturally suggest to the fierc&#xD;
and the grasping, eager temperament. The site of the habi&#xD;
of Don l~althazar was happily found upon a gentle emi~&#xD;
which afforded equal glimpses of the city and the sea. It~&#xD;
zon was only circumscribed by its trees,-fruita~e and flp~&#xD;
an excess of which the best taste, in a warm climate, woul&#xD;
it difficult to complain. The air that breathed balm ever&#xD;
its atmosphere-the breeze swelling at frequent periods fr&#xD;
tributary seas-the chirp of innocent insects, and the sc&#xD;
uncaged, but never wandering birds-were all suggestive&#xD;
condition of the dolce far niente of the fatal tyranny of wh&#xD;
sage and moralist dilate in warning exhortation ever,,&#xD;
which they are always most ready to submit with pleas&#xD;
to remember with regret and yearning. Fruits of every li&#xD;
variety, flowers of the most golden and glorious hues ai&#xD;
fumes, vines and leaves of all most grateful descriptions,]&#xD;
nized with this happy empire, where the passions, whether&#xD;
ing or triumphant, might here find themselves at home&#xD;
shadiest palms, and other trees of equal verdure and fra~&#xD;
compensatedd for the absence of grandeur and sublimity,&#xD;
indeed, must have been inconsistent with the peculiar m&#xD;
such an abode. The attractions of this sweet seclusion ~w&#xD;
wholly confined to the gift~ and attributes of nature. Th4&#xD;
of art had been made tAbutary, in high degree, to he~&#xD;
wants. The sire of the Lady Olivia, who had left it for h~&#xD;
in the keeping of his brother, had ~nade it after the fashion:&#xD;

&#xD;
own nature, which was meek in its desires, and a worshipper of&#xD;
the graceful, the peaceful and the beautiful. Th~ luxuries of such&#xD;
an abode were doubly refined and spiritualizes to the soul of&#xD;
taste, by the sweet repose, the delicious security which hung, as&#xD;
with a veil, over the partial solitude. ~At a little distance lay the&#xD;
white dwellings of the infant city, the voices of its daily toil and&#xD;
struggle rising only as a faint and pleasant murmur, most like&#xD;
the sweet chiding of distant billows ona rocky shore. The sea, at a&#xD;
like distance, had also a pleasant music for the dwellers in this&#xD;
forest home, Where, through long and complicated avenues of&#xD;
greenest foliage, the fond and contemplative spirit might make its&#xD;
way, with just enough of the consciousness of life for pleasure,&#xD;
and not enough of its toils and apprehensions for anxiety or&#xD;
care.&#xD;
Here, then, with few attendants, and but one companion, the&#xD;
subtle, the mercenary, and sleepless politician, Balthazar de Al-&#xD;
varo, made his abode. Hither he took his way, with slower foot-&#xD;
step than was his wont, after separating from the adelantado.&#xD;
He had run a sort of gauntlet of inquiry, as he emerged from the&#xD;
presence of De Soto, and made his way through the city, by&#xD;
which his mood had undergone no peculiar sweetening. Rut it&#xD;
was admirable to witness thQ strength of a much exercised and&#xD;
well-trained will, in subduing the outbreaks of a temper which&#xD;
had suffered a series of most painful provocations throughout the&#xD;
day. He could smile graciously as he replied deferentially to his&#xD;
equal; nor was he wanting in a certain kind of smile, when he&#xD;
answered the inquiries of his inferior. The necessities and ob-&#xD;
jects of De Soto required much exercise of the arts of concilia-&#xD;
tion on the part of his associates; nor was Don Balthazar Want-&#xD;
ing in that policy which teaches that none are too humble to be&#xD;
incapable of harm in season-none too worthless for use in cer-&#xD;
tain periods. He traversed the interval between the dwelling of&#xD;
the adelantado and his own, vexed at every step in his progress,&#xD;
yet without betraying his vexation to the most worthless&#xD;
spectator.&#xD;

himself upon the earth, at the foot of a noble palm, whict&#xD;
encircled by a dense thicket of tributary vines and shru~&#xD;
yielded to speech a portion of the troubles which had we&#xD;
hitherto in silence upon his 'mind.&#xD;

THE FATHER'S 5OLILOQUy.                 27&#xD;
thrust it back a moment after, drew his cap above his eyes, and&#xD;
stretched himself along upon the sward, with his face downward.&#xD;
Here he lay in complete silence, and scarcely stirring, the full&#xD;
space Qf half an hour. Meanwhile, the day waned. The sun&#xD;
- was at his setting, and the night birds began wheeling, with faint&#xD;
shrieks, about the place whei'e he seemed to slumber. But&#xD;
slumber was not upon his eyelids, or in his thoughts. It was not&#xD;
his necessity just then. He rose, at length, with the deliberation -&#xD;
of one who has recovered the fhll sway over all his moods, and,&#xD;
adjusting his garments, prepared to move towards his dwelling,&#xD;
which was still at some distance, and hidden 'wholly from his&#xD;
eyes by the sinuosity of the avenues, and the denseness of the&#xD;
thicket. But he paused more than once on his progress, and,&#xD;
more than once, did words of brief soliloquy break from his*&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
"At least, I must soon know all. There must be an explana..&#xD;
tion. I must fathom her secret. I must probe her heart to its&#xD;
core. If that be safe-4f she be what she hath been sufficiently&#xD;
trained to be-what such training indeed should have made her,~"&#xD;
and a grim smile passed over his features as he spoke,-" then&#xD;
this Philip d~ Vasconselos can do no hurt. Let him live. He&#xD;
will scarcely linger here. But if there be sentiment in her&#xD;
bosom, newly born and from his agency, such as I would have&#xD;
trampled out, if need be, in blood and fire,-.----.a sentiment hostile&#xD;
to my hold upon her-then must I strike,-.-.strike fatally,~and&#xD;
crush the danger in its very bud. But, I must penetrate her&#xD;
secret. She hath grown subtle of late,.-..-that is an evil sign.&#xD;
It is enough that she katl&amp;amp; a secret, and from me. That alone is&#xD;
significant of danger! Doth her reserve signify distrust of&#xD;
me? Ha! what else? Do her tears manifest a feeling for&#xD;
another? Then is~it a proof that she holds me in hate and&#xD;
loathing. I must search, fathom this mystery, and be as swift&#xD;
and stern as I am vigilant !"&#xD;
This speech was not spoken all at once, but in snatches, during&#xD;
his walk, md each soliloquy compelling his momentary pause.&#xD;
In this ~nanner he went forward, his features and manner becona..&#xD;

Ai~ length the cottage and its 'gay verandahs opened before Ii&#xD;
and he paused as he caught a glimpse of his niece, where she&#xD;
d~ami1y reclining, empowered in the grateful shades of the&#xD;
tr~es by which the dwelling was surrounded.&#xD;
Olivia de Alvaro, as we now behold~her, her form dispc&#xD;
at ease, stretched on ample cushions, in the airy recesseS of&#xD;
verandah, would seem, from the half-shut eye, and the am&#xD;
motionless attitude in which she lay, to have been wrapt in&#xD;
most grateful slumbers. She was evidently unconscious of&#xD;
rays of the fast disappearing sunlight, which shot, faint and&#xD;
k~nly, through the intervening foliage. She was a pale, p'&#xD;
beauty, one whose high and aristocratic features seemed scar&#xD;
consistent with that despondency of mood and dependency o&#xD;
ture, which have been described as her present character~&#xD;
]~Ler features were not regular, but there wa~ a strange ham&#xD;
between them nevertheless; the lofty brow, corresponding&#xD;
with the distinctly rounded chin,-the large and well-fm&#xD;
nose, and that 'drooping darkness of the Moorish eye,' whic&#xD;
we know,-though it may slumber long in cloud and shado&#xD;
is still capable of such sudden lightuir~s as consume at the ~&#xD;
flash. We have already described her as very young-sca&#xD;
more than seventeen ;-but this youthfulness was not marks~&#xD;
the usual frankness-the uncircuni~pect and exuberant flo~&#xD;
that period. Her countenance was marked by an earnest&#xD;
an intensity of gaze-and expression, which denoted a mature,&#xD;
thought and feeling quite beyond her years. It is surprisin~&#xD;
rapidly one lives, who has learned to feel, and been made t&#xD;
fer. Yet what had been the sources of suffering in her'?&#xD;
beautiful, well-beloved, what were the cares of Olivia de A~&#xD;
by which she had grown so singularly mature'? This we&#xD;
ascertain in feature pages.. Enough, if now we continue tl~&#xD;

She was tall, and of commanding figure and demeanor.,&#xD;

~reyed the impression of a sense of awe, compelling her fears, and&#xD;
depressing her elasticity. This expression, particularly at those&#xD;
moments when she seemed to become forgetful of every other&#xD;
presence, commended her to sympathy, rather than offended&#xD;
pride. There could be no jealousy of her superiority, in the evi-&#xD;
dent feeling of apprehension which she displayed. A vague&#xD;
sense of danger seemed to accompany the consciousness of her&#xD;
charms; and the effect was rather to humble and subdue all the&#xD;
loftier indications that were yet inseparable from the graces&#xD;
of her manner, and the conscious nobility of blood and beauty.&#xD;
To these she was by no means insensible. Her carriage was&#xD;
such as shoWed an habitual appreciation of all her possessions;&#xD;
yet so modifi d as to make nature more conspicuous than habit&#xD;
in her demean r. The heart of a young damsel naturally, and&#xD;
very soon, be omes sensible of the beauties of her person. Her&#xD;
mirror, and t e common language of society,. read equally in&#xD;
speech and m nner, soon teach her all the value of her charms.&#xD;
But a refined aste renders it impossible, if she really should be&#xD;
attractive, that she should escape this conviction. It is her merit&#xD;
when she does not presume upon her possessions, and is modestly&#xD;
content in th&amp;amp; enjoyment. It is in due degree with the devel-&#xD;
opment of her intellect, and the experience of afflictions, that she&#xD;
schools her var4ty. That Olivia del Aivaro had, in large measure,&#xD;
learned to tuto~' hers, might be ga1~hered from many indications.&#xD;
That she was ~ot insensible to her own charms, was equally evi-&#xD;
dent from the 4xercises in which she employed them. Few dam-&#xD;
sels knew so w~11 how to train the glance, to give variety and&#xD;
play to the expressive muscles, and the pleasing, persuasive&#xD;
action; to sub 4 ue to sweetness, and the most touching tender-&#xD;
ness of tone, th~ murmurs of the obedient voice; to mak the&#xD;
fingers speak, a~ with an endowment of their own, and to inform,&#xD;
with a nameless, but most winning flexibility, every move~nent&#xD;
of the well-regi4lated and exquisitely symmetrical figure. ~[Jalf&#xD;

the slightly waving leaves of the ana~na and the orange, she~&#xD;
appeared wholly regardless of the timid brightness that sprinkle~&#xD;
as with fairy eyes, the apartment all about her feet. She seen~&#xD;
to muse m far delicious fancies, that made her wholly unc~&#xD;
scious of the actual world in which she lived. Her person, uii&#xD;
strained by any human presence, had naturally subsided into&#xD;
attitude equally graceful and voluptuous; and this was altogeI~&#xD;
the unstudied action of a grace, which, natural always, had~&#xD;
always recognized in art only the appointed assistant, the ti~&#xD;
woman and handmaid, of the imperial nature. Her dark, gld&#xD;
hair, hung.upon her shoulders, from which jt descended in wa&#xD;
but massive tresses. The art which had, withoutt an effort,&#xD;
posed their flowing and magnificent folds, ~ad never been&#xD;
successful in removing all proof of its own adorning fin&#xD;
Slightly stirred by the fitful zephyrs of an afternoon in May,&#xD;
season which, in Cuba, recognizes the perfect presence of the&#xD;
hosomed summer, her ringlets played' upon her neck like y&#xD;
birds, for the first time conscious of their wings, yet still flul&#xD;
ing, timidly and fondly, about the parent nest. And thus&#xD;
reclined, clad in robes of '~#hite, slightly trimmed with blue'&#xD;
orange, seemingly unconscious of all things but those which -~&#xD;
deeply hidden in her thoughts, at the moment when Don Balth&#xD;
drew nigh to the dwelling.&#xD;
The shrubbery had enabled him to approach unseen,&#xD;
within a few steps of the verandah. He could detect the fain&#xD;
~ outline of her person through the leaves of a gorgeous or~&#xD;
beneath which he stood silently beholding her. She dreamed&#xD;
f his presence. His footstep had been carefully set down,&#xD;
riot to disturb her; and thus unsuspected, he stood, for a fe~&#xD;
ments, watching her with a singular and intense interest. J&#xD;

fastens upon the unconscious bird that flies or flutters in his&#xD;

paternal affection. And yet there was a something bitter in the&#xD;
smile which o~casionally played upon his lips; and the slight&#xD;
frown which d~Lrkened in his glance was significant of a disquiet&#xD;
or disappointment, the sources of which we may not yet compre..&#xD;
hend. Suspicion, too, might be seen to lurk ~even beneath the&#xD;
smile of the observer, and his secret watch might have been dic-&#xD;
tated by a policy which was not above the indulgence of a&#xD;
baseness.&#xD;
And yet his purpose did not seem to be espionage. A sudden&#xD;
and troublesome thought-perhaps a suddenly suggested curios-&#xD;
ity-appeared to arrest his footsteps on his approach. Her ap-&#xD;
pearance, hera attitude, seemed to invite his study. It was to&#xD;
muse, to meditate, or, perhaps, to' prepare his mind for some&#xD;
exigent duty that he paused, without seeking to disturb the dam-&#xD;
sel in her vacant mood. She, too, had her causes for meditation;&#xD;
though one might readily ascribe the dreamy languor of her atti-&#xD;
tude to the bla~id and seductive influences of the climate. To the&#xD;
voluptuous idh~r, already familiar with that luxury of situation&#xD;
which ~uspend~ the thought, and strips, the fancy of everything&#xD;
but wings, her appearance would seem natural enough, and her~&#xD;
conjectured reveries would only be the most grateful, yet unim-&#xD;
pressive in the world. It would be only to liken her bower to&#xD;
the wizard do~am of that archimage who wove his perpetual&#xD;
snares in the C4stle of Indolence, making all things dreamy and&#xD;
delusive in the half-shut eye. But the meditations of Olivia de&#xD;
Alvaro were of~ a sort, perhaps, even more deeply troublesome&#xD;
than those of her uncle. Big tears might be seen to gather in&#xD;
her eye-slowly, it is true, .and few,-but they were such as we&#xD;
seldom look to see in the eyes of young and innocent loveliness.&#xD;
The great dro s silently oozing from beneath their dark and&#xD;
drooping fringe ,like some gradual stream gliding silently forth&#xD;
from the overhanging alders, were not unseen by her&#xD;
uncle. His features became graver as he beheld them, and he&#xD;
looked aside-he looked down-as if anxious to shut them from&#xD;
his sight. He turned away hastily a moment after, and, with&#xD;
careful footstep, retreated silently from his place of watch. Tak~&#xD;

a~er a little interval, was ret~~ in the direction of the d&#xD;
big, when his ear was aroused by the sound of approa&#xD;
voices. He promptly shrouded himself in a little copse of&#xD;
a~lil~la. Here he could easily distinguish th~ persons of the vlsi&#xD;
himself unseen. In a few moments they had reached the&#xD;
~here he stood concealed. 'they proved to be the young ga&#xD;

It was with something of. chagrin and disquiet that Doi&#xD;
thazar discovered wh' were the approaching parties. H(&#xD;
almost spoken his annoyances aloud, as they passed onws&#xD;
the cottage. His vexation was not long ~suppressed. As so&#xD;
they had pass~2l into the verandah, he retired from his pla&#xD;
watch, to a spot of greater seclusion in the groves, and th&#xD;
sionate soliloquy to which he gaye utterance afforded some&#xD;
clue to the nature of his secret meditations.&#xD;

own claims. The cloud that receives and swallows up the star,&#xD;
has no shame for such effrontery; an~ even guilt may worship with&#xD;
hope at the altars of the pure and beautiful. I cannot doubt that&#xD;
she loves him. Else why this change since he came upon the&#xD;
island? Why these tears-~this despondency-this drooping fear,&#xD;
-this trcmblin~ and perpetual cloud and apprehension? She&#xD;
shrinks from other eyes-from mine. Her own are cast upon&#xD;
the earth, or closed from study. Could other eyes but read, like&#xD;
mine, she wouki have no secret to reveal! It is well that she&#xD;
dare not speak. The very passion that she feels for this stranger&#xD;
is my security. ~he must subdue these inclinations. She must stifle&#xD;
this working fan~y which these meddling foolswill blowinto a flame.&#xD;
She shall stifle i~! Fortunately, I am her wills I have ever led her&#xD;
as a child. She has known no impulses of her own, save those of&#xD;
infancy, until now; and she will scarcely now withstand that gov-&#xD;
erning rule which hath hitherto swayed her as the breezes sway the&#xD;
leaf. I would, ~ that this had not been the case. I have peril-&#xD;
led upon ~ moment the security of a life; but regret is unavailing&#xD;
now. I must continue as I have begun. I must still assert the&#xD;
superior will of a master,'-not simply to secure my slave, but to&#xD;
assure myself ofj safety. * It will be easy, and why should I scru-&#xD;
ple to do it? Why this fear, this feebleness? I will overcome&#xD;
it as before! ~he ~shall bend, she shall bow, or break in the&#xD;
conflict! But there will be no conflict: She will offer no opposi-&#xD;
tion-none that I cannot soon disarm. Had it been her fierce&#xD;
Biscayan mother, I should have no such victory. She would&#xD;

of himself. She has seen nothing in hi~ expenditure, ort conduct,&#xD;
which would m~ake him appear in her eyes to be a mercenary.&#xD;
IJer minorit~ had been singularly managed, so as to keep her in&#xD;
a state of niental vassalage, quite uncommon on the island.&#xD;
She had been kept in almost complete seclusion until the appear.&#xD;
ance of De ~oto and his lady, when it was impossible to with-&#xD;
hold her from the court; her own wealth, her father's name, and&#xD;
the position of her uncle, equally requiring it. Up to this period&#xD;
she little dreamed of the treasures which the world had in&#xD;
its keeping. She little knew the value of her own. But in the&#xD;
course of a single night the germ of passion had blossomed, and&#xD;
Love r~ipidly~ maturing beneath its fervid warmth, had taught&#xD;
her a grief in teaching her a faith. Alas! she knew not till now&#xD;
how precious, how radiant white, must be the first offerings de-&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
"But a month ago,&#xD;
I went from hence, and then 'twas fresh&#xD;
In murmur, (as you know what great ones do&#xD;
The less will prattle of) that he did seek&#xD;
The love of fair Olivia."-TwxLvrH NxGirr.&#xD;
THE pleasant laughter, and gay voices of Nuno de Tobar,&#xD;
his betrothed, prepared Olivia de Alvaro for their approach.&#xD;
trace of tears was quickly obliterated from her ekes, and&#xD;
strove with smiles to welcome her visitors. Pride, as&#xD;
one of the chief           for&#xD;
alleged by her uncle, was                   se~curi~3ies&#xD;
strength, no less than for his safety. She was one of those&#xD;
love not that the world should behold or suspect tl~eir sorr&#xD;
But her pride was rather a habit than a passion. She had (&#xD;
and. more fiery qualities in her nature, for which he f~i1ed to&#xD;
her credit. He deceived himself when he thought e knew&#xD;
thoroughly. Some of her characteristics were ~et abey~&#xD;
some moods and passions. which are likely to c found&#xD;
astonish him hereafter. But these in proper season She,&#xD;
self, is perhaps as little aware, as her uncle, of her na&#xD;
endowments.&#xD;
Olivia received her guests on the steps of her ver4ndah.&#xD;
cloud had disappeared from her face, the light had return&#xD;
her large and lustrous eyes, and with the sweetest voice ii&#xD;
world, she welcomed them to an abode which, t~ the c&#xD;
visitor, would seem to be entirely secure from s~rrow.&#xD;
young creatures who now entered it, themselves ~iewlyi&#xD;
happy, were certainly not the persons to make any discover&#xD;
the latent troubles of its inmate; and assuming the happen&#xD;
other hearts, which they felt in their own, they poui'ed out&#xD;
Olivia a torrent of congratulations, which it required consi&#xD;

ble strength of endurance to withstand. She had heard of their&#xD;
betrothal, arid of the forgiveness which De Soto had extended to&#xD;
the erring gallant. Society at that day in Cuba was not par-~&#xD;
ticularly jealous of propriety. That Leonora I3ovadilla had&#xD;
sinned, found its sufficient excuse with knight and lady, in the&#xD;
simple fact that she loved; and it was only with that class of&#xD;
ancients, of her own sex, who had survived even the hope of a&#xD;
change from single to dependent blessedness.-a number singu-&#xD;
larly few in every community-that censure claimed the privi-&#xD;
lege still to wag a slanderous tongue under the guise of a jealous&#xD;
virtue. Olivia de Alvaro had never been of the number to&#xD;
reproach the poor Leonora for her lapse, even when it was&#xD;
doubtful whether the sense of virtue, the sentiment of honor,&#xD;
or the feeling of love, in Nuno de Tohar, would prompt him&#xD;
to repair his wrong according to the worldly usage, by&#xD;
making her his wife. Having known her as a thoughtless child,&#xD;
without guile as without experience, a creature of extreme levi-&#xD;
ty, but without any impulses to evil more than seemed naturally&#xD;
to belong to the mercurial temper, Olivia was not prepared to re-&#xD;
gard her as guilty, because she had been weak. She was&#xD;
indulgent in proportion as the world showed itself severe. She&#xD;
knew~ according to a common history, that,&#xD;
"Every woe a tear may claim,&#xD;
Except an erring sister's shame,"&#xD;
and rising above the prejudices of the world, as much through&#xD;
sympathy as generous ty, she suffered her manner towards the&#xD;
frail offender to show none of those harsher aspects which for-&#xD;
ever insist upon its faults~ On the contrary, a tender solicitude&#xD;
seemed desirous to soothe the humiliations of the suffi~rer, and&#xD;
make her forgetful of those public disgraces which she could not&#xD;
always hope to escape. Leonora felt all this, and repaid the&#xD;
kindness of Olivia by as much devotion as could distinguish a&#xD;
nature so thoughtless. The first visit which she made, after the&#xD;
reconciliation of her guardian with her lover, was that which we&#xD;
now witness. Of course, the peculiar case of the visitors was not&#xD;

one to be spoken of openly. The silent pressure of Leoi&#xD;
hand by Olivia, the tender kiss which she impressed upc&#xD;
cheeks, and the single ~tear which gathered in her eye, ~&#xD;
whispered a hurried word of congratulation, sufficiently a~&#xD;
the former of the continuance of that sympathy ~hich h&#xD;
ready afforded her so much solace. But she erre~l, perh~&#xD;
ascribing the tear to the sympathies of friendship. Had si&#xD;
beheld the big drops that fell from the same fruitiful foui&#xD;
but a little while before, she might have suspected oth&#xD;
more selfish sources of sorrow in her friend.&#xD;
Seated in the cool shadows of the verandah, th~ gay L4&#xD;
soon opened her stores of prattle. She had ga1~hered&#xD;
rumors of the day,. alkd ~he was impatient to unfol~1 them.&#xD;
"And 0! dearest livia, have you heard of th9 tourna&#xD;
The town is full of it. It is to be the greatest 4nd the&#xD;
of all the shows that we hav9 had. They have begun ti&#xD;
operations already. Such a painting of shields and barn&#xD;
such* a s openingg of swords and burnishing of lances,&#xD;

The other shook her head very mournflilly.&#xD;
.." Nay, never shake your head; you know it as well as&#xD;
of them, indeed; and you might have a dozen, iI~ you&#xD;

"Me proud, Leonora !" reproachfully.&#xD;
"No! ~o! I don't meanthat! Ioz~gI&amp;amp;ttoknowifa&#xD;

"I am a child; but I don't mock you. It is so. I b~&#xD;
all, and everybody else thinks so. I'm sure youd have&#xD;

The hand of Olivia was passed with a close pressure over her&#xD;
brows. Little did the thoughtless Leonora dream that the action&#xD;
was occasioned by a feeling of pain. She continued:&#xD;
"But of the homage of the knights of Portugal, nobody has a&#xD;
question. It is in every one's ~mouth; everybody~ sees that both&#xD;
the brothers love you to distraction. The question with them all&#xD;
is, which of them you favor. Now, I am for Don Andres, the&#xD;
younger; but Nuno-"&#xD;
Here she was interrupted by a loik from her Ietrothed, for&#xD;
which Olivia was properly grateflil. The subject seemed to an-&#xD;
noy her.&#xD;
"Hush, hush, dear Leonora !-.Tell us of the tournament rather.&#xD;
This is not the season to talk of love, but of war. See how the&#xD;
adelantado treats the affections, when they come in conflict with&#xD;
his ambition. Who so lovely, so stately, so noble, so like a&#xD;
Queen, as the Lady Isabella ?-yet will he leave her, a newly-&#xD;
wedded wife, to go on wild adventures against the Floridians.&#xD;
Fie upon such chivalry, such devotion, such love! What need&#xD;
bath he of further wars ?-hath he not wealth enough from Peru?&#xD;
..-hath he not grandeur enough as Governor of this goodly island,&#xD;
and reputed one of the noblest cavaliers of Spain? Methinks&#xD;
he wantonly ffings from him a living and a glorious treasure, for&#xD;
a dream-for a shadow which will mock his hope, and defraud&#xD;
him of all his happiness."&#xD;
Olivia had spoken rapidly, in order, possibly, to divert the in-&#xD;
terest of her companions to other subjects. In speaking, how-&#xD;
ever, of the projected conquest of Florida, she yet trenched upon&#xD;
the province of Nuno de Tobar, and indirectly assailed his conduct&#xD;
also. He, too, like De Soto, had, acquired the love of a young and&#xD;
beautiful woman; he had formed ties equaUy precious, which he&#xD;
wa~ about to abandon at the calls of ambition; and though his&#xD;
state was neither secure, nor his possessions great like those of the&#xD;
latter, yet the imputation, in some degree, lay against him, of a&#xD;
like disregard to the claims of duty and domestic life. He an-&#xD;
swered Olivia after the usual manner of knight-errants.&#xD;
"And how else, dear lady, can chivalry display itself; unless&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7781-00000023"/>&#xD;
V~A~OQNSELOB.&#xD;
by deeds of arms and conquest ~ It is by these deeds &amp;amp;~&#xD;
conquest, that it brings home tribute to Beauty, and crow&#xD;
with its proper jewels. It is to make love secure in st&#xD;
home, and refresh its bowers with lasting delight, that it (&#xD;
ters peril for a season, the laurels and rewards of which si&#xD;
dure through future years. Love is not abandoned when t&#xD;
shipper carries ever ~ith him in his heart a passionate d~&#xD;
which makes him cry upon the beloved one's name in the st&#xD;
* battle, and pray for her prayers in the tempests of the deei&#xD;
* prompts him to build for her a temple in waste places, an&#xD;
wreath chaplets of her favorite flowers in forests which s~&#xD;
never see. His devotion even warms with distance, and&#xD;
members her beauties and her virtues the better when&#xD;
longer may enjoy them. If he goes forth, it is with the&#xD;
that he may return full-handed with spoils, that he mazy&#xD;
her feet in guerdon og his faith and homage."&#xD;
"Ah! Sei'ior, you phrase it well, and it is such fine elc&#xD;
that.for a season reconciles the: poor heart of woman to to(&#xD;
of the errantries of chivalry. For me, I confess, wouldd&#xD;
please me should my knight leave to others the storm o&#xD;
and the, peril of the seas. Let me have the devotions&#xD;
heart at the altars of home, rather than in the forests&#xD;
Floridian. Let me have the idol of my eyes always prc&#xD;
my sight.. I should not need that he should wander awa&#xD;
my eyes to be~ able to recall his virtues and grow fonc&#xD;
devotion."&#xD;
"Oh! Fie, Olivia, dear,---you have no sort idea&#xD;
belongs to true chivalry. Why, true chivalry lives on:&#xD;
and conquest, on long wanderings over sea and land, intc&#xD;
that were never heard of before, seeking all sorts of ene~&#xD;
overthrow, and coming home with treasures of gold, gi~&#xD;
heralds, such as they gather iii Peru, 'pearls,-pearl~&#xD;

A. FORMIDABLE QPPON~NT.&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have no knights, Leonora, and this reminds me that I have&#xD;
really no interest in this game of war that is called chivalry.&#xD;
Let those like it who may. Its splendid shops do not beguile&#xD;
or satisfy my imagination."&#xD;
"Ah! but they will in the tournament, which ~aL1~and.&#xD;
Don't tell me that you hav&amp;amp; no knight. I promi e you, dear&#xD;
Olivia, that you will have knights enough to. do battle for your&#xD;
smiles, and to wear your favors. These knights of Portugal&#xD;
will not be the only ones to break lances in your honor. But lets&#xD;
them beware how they cross with my Nuno. If he does not&#xD;
unhorse every opponent, I ~will never, never,~never love him any&#xD;
more. And that's a vow to the Blessed&#xD;
"Don't be rash, Leonora," interrupted Nuno, with a smile.&#xD;
"You may punish yourself by such a vow, much more than you&#xD;
could ever punish me!"&#xD;
"Ha! Howl"&#xD;
He evaded the query, and went on.&#xD;
"As for overthrowing these knights of Portugal, it is no easy&#xD;
in~tter. I should rather cross lances with any other foes! Philip&#xD;
de Vasconselos .-'~&#xD;
"How! Are you recreant? Will you allow these Portuguese&#xD;
to pluck the honors from Castile'?"&#xD;
"Nay, ~y! not if I can help it. flut I should prefer other&#xD;
hands than mine to make the attempt. The world has few&#xD;
lances which can safely cross that of Philip de Vasconselos, and&#xD;
mine, I fear, is not one of them; and I so love the man that I&#xD;
should find no satisfaction in depriving him of* a single glory&#xD;
that he desires. But something, as you say, is due to the honor&#xD;
of Castle, and if Philip overthrows all other combatants, he&#xD;
must have a chance of including me among his captives."&#xD;
The eyes of ~Olivia were cast upon the ground. But her ears&#xD;
drank in eagerly every syllable which had fallen from the gen-&#xD;
erous lips of Nuno de Tobar. She did not speak when he had*&#xD;
closed, nor for some time after, but remained apparently a silent&#xD;
listener to the gay and desultory prattle of Leonora, who, in t~e&#xD;
fulness of her heart, assured of her own happiness, and relieved&#xD;

of all doubts of the future, had given herself up to that&#xD;
and roving method which but too commonly distinguish&#xD;
mercurial temper. She was arrested when about to tren&#xD;
dangerous ground-when about to renew her badinage it&#xD;
to Olivia's feelings for the knights o~7 Portugal,~~~Lby the&#xD;
ance of one of them. Fortunately, his approach had bec&#xD;
in season to prevent her speech.&#xD;
The visitor was the younger of the two. Andres de V~&#xD;
los had many of the qualities ofhis elder brother; Philip&#xD;
persons were ~not unlike, their courage and the contour&#xD;
pression of their 'races. They had both served as well&#xD;
the Moors of Spain as the red-men of the western c&#xD;
But Philip, the elder, enjoyed the high distinction of b&#xD;
ally understood when the family name was mentioned.&#xD;
done famous things under Almagro in Peru. He had on~&#xD;
traversed the neighboring continent of the Appalachian&#xD;
as far as Cabeza de la Yaca hadi carried his exploration&#xD;
was Wise, besides, prudent, circumspect and gentle, ai&#xD;
were virtues to which the younger brother, Andres, had 1&#xD;
claim. Of Philip we shall say more hereafter. Of An&#xD;
world spak~ with many qualifications. He was desc&#xD;
protid and passionate-quick of quarrel arrogant in his&#xD;
tions and of enormous self-conceit. We have already Th&#xD;
mated that he, as well as his brother, as now in doubt&#xD;
to continue in a future progress with the expedition of&#xD;
Yet they ~iad both left Spain with this special object, con&#xD;
to the New World as a portion of the armament. Som&#xD;
the reason for their change of purpose has akeady I&#xD;
tested. They had, in fact, found but little encburagerr&#xD;
the adelantado,-less, perhaps, because of his ~nappre&#xD;
their merits-for he thought of the brothers vei~y highl'&#xD;
consequence of the bigotry and jealousy of the Span&#xD;
tains-their' clannish prejudices, and a somewhat painful&#xD;
their inferiority, at least, to the elder of the knights of&#xD;

tinctions in the army, and as their military passion became cooled,&#xD;
that of love made its appearance to assist in usurping the place of&#xD;
the former in their bosoms. Unhappily, their affections were&#xD;
fixed upon the same lady. The devotion of Andres de Vascon-&#xD;
selos led him almost nightly to her dwelling. Philip was a fre-&#xD;
quent visitor; but he so chose his periods as seldom to cross his&#xD;
brother's progress. Andres little knew how friuch he owed to&#xD;
this forbearance. He was slow to perceive, what was seen by all&#xD;
the island, that, if the heart of Olivia de Alvaro inclined to either,&#xD;
he certainly was not the suitor whom she most preferred. His&#xD;
self-esteem was not willing to accept any such humiliating sug&#xD;
gestion.&#xD;
Olivia naturally received him with respect and kindness. She&#xD;
felt uneasy at his attefitions, but she respected him because of her&#xD;
attachment to his brother. It was easSr, with his temper, to mis-&#xD;
take the sources of this kindness. But he was not suffered to&#xD;
presume upon it. A certain dignified but mild reserve, in the&#xD;
manni~rs of the lady, served to check every feeling of overweening&#xD;
confidence, and to satisfy the bold gallant that the fortress must&#xD;
undergo a regular leaguer before the garrison would be persuaded&#xD;
to surrender. He endeavored accordingly to school his eager de-&#xD;
sires, with as much patience as he could command; and to lessen&#xD;
the duration of the siege, his attacks were rendered more anl&#xD;
more frequent. It was seldom that a night was suffered to pass&#xD;
without finding him in her presence; and the gentleness of her re-&#xD;
ception, and the sweetness of her manners, seldom suffered him&#xD;
to h~ave her without giving his eager vanity sufficient assurance&#xD;
of favorable progress. She beheld this confidence with pain, and&#xD;
her reserves were increased accordingly ;-but as these never put&#xD;
on harsh aspects, nothing ~was done to arrest the self-delusion of&#xD;
the lover.&#xD;
A little awkwardness succeeded his first appearance within the&#xD;
~t4rcle. Nuno de Tobar was the friend of Philip de Vasconselos&#xD;
rather than his brother. He had never been altogether satisfied&#xD;
with the latter. He was aware of the attachment of both for&#xD;
his fair hostess.......perhaps suspected the nature of her feelings for&#xD;

Andres was naturally jealous of one whom he had reas&#xD;
lieve was in his brother's confidence; while Nuno d~&#xD;
though fond of Philip de Yasconselos, had anything but&#xD;
feeling for Andres. The imperious temper of the latter&#xD;
than once, brought them to the verge of quarrel. Th&#xD;
change of civilities on the present occasion was cold an&#xD;
and, tho~zgh the fair hostess, seeing ,the feeling betwe&#xD;
mad~ an amiable effort to interest the party, still the at&#xD;
for a while grew oppressive from mere stifihess and&#xD;
But the confidence of Andres de Vasconselos was of a s&#xD;
permit this influence to prevail to his discomfiture; a&#xD;
severance that suffered no discouragement from a freeze&#xD;
was soon rewarded by a conversation, which, if not ac&#xD;
mated, was yet sufficiently so to keep the scene from&#xD;
&#xD;
absolutely oppressive. By a strong effort of will, for&#xD;
previous exercise had not often prepared her, Olivia t&#xD;
enablee share in the dialogue, and Don Andres was enc&#xD;

subjects which was started. This was the affairs of the&#xD;
the expedition, and naturally enough of the toiirnam&#xD;
thoughtless speech of Leonora conducted~ her to an in&#xD;
answer to which drew the eyes of Olivia directly&#xD;
knight of Portugal.&#xD;
"They say of thee and of thy brother, Don Andr&#xD;
are not minded to proceed on this expedition into the (&#xD;

"Of what Philip de Vasconselos designs, fair lady, i&#xD;

wilt be among the first to hear and answer. But, of' a surety,&#xD;

"AAd yet," answered the knight of Portugal, with a smile&#xD;
that might have been mistaken for a sneer, "were it not as great&#xD;
a rashness if I should venture in a passage at arms with sih for~&#xD;
tunate gallants as Don Nuno de Tobar, who wears the favors of&#xD;
one of' the loveliest damsels of Cuba'? It will need something&#xD;
more than skill and valor to render a poor knight of Portugal&#xD;
successful against the cavaliers of Castile, when they couch spear&#xD;
under the smiles of the most invincible beauty."&#xD;
There was something equivocal in this remark that made Nuno&#xD;
de Tobar wince, but his betrothed did not perceive it. She went&#xD;
on, slily glancing, as she spoke, at the pale face of Olivia, which&#xD;
put on an increasing gravity as she listened.&#xD;
"Yet seems it to me, SefYor, that thou wilt scarcely lack in the&#xD;
auspices which befriend thy opponent. I doubt not but the&#xD;
smiles of Beauty will give thee sufficient encouragement. At&#xD;
least, it is scarcely fitting that a true knight should suffer from&#xD;
such want."&#xD;
The eyes of Andres de Vasconselos followed those of Leonora,&#xD;
as she looked mischievously in the direction of her friend. The&#xD;
reference was quite unfortunate. There wa~ no mistaking the&#xD;
resolute gravity which absolutely groomed the features of Oli-&#xD;
via. But her face was no longer pale. A warm flush rose&#xD;
upon her cheeks at the same moment, of the soi~rce of which&#xD;
Don Andres readily deceived himself. His vain arA eager fancy&#xD;
easily construed this flush~ into a confession of weakness,-and a&#xD;
proud exulting glance, which he did not seek to restrain, betrayed&#xD;
toOlivia the delightful conviction which he felt. But her eyes&#xD;
made no answer to his own, and the flush passing immediately&#xD;
from her' cheeks, was succeeded by an almost mortal paleness,&#xD;
which was by no means diminished while Andres continued to&#xD;
speak in answer to the grateful suggestions of Leonora. He had&#xD;
his reply, full of empressement, to the pleasing insinuation which&#xD;
she had conveyed, quite as much, perhaps, by the direction of her&#xD;
glance, as by the language which she had uttered. His reply~&#xD;

though the mere words might disclaim his sense of trim&#xD;
yet distinguished by a manner which betrayed the most&#xD;
assurance.&#xD;
"Alas! Lady Leonora, thou wouldst betray "me to z&#xD;
Would' I could rejoice in any such hope as that which&#xD;
couragest. But how should it be for me, a poor k&#xD;
Portugal, by no means in favor with your proud noble~&#xD;
tile, to hope for better countenance from hex~ proud ar&#xD;
daughters'? Yet the bird .will spread his wings for the:&#xD;
of the sun! The fond insect will dart, though it be t&#xD;
into the bla7Ang flame or pyre ;-and I fear that, hopele~&#xD;
glory that I seek, and destined to equal peril in the&#xD;
too am ambitious of the prize that but mocks my be&#xD;
vor."&#xD;
"Thou confesses then-thou lovest'" was the eage:&#xD;
of the gay and thoughtless Leonora.&#xD;
"Ali! wouldst thou possess 'thyself of my secret'? ~i&#xD;
only to make merry with my weakness. Surely; in&#xD;
fortune which has smiled upon thy heart, it were scarce&#xD;
oixs to find a pleasure to show to the world the disapp&#xD;
which mock the 'desire now preying hopelessly, perch:&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
"Not hopelessly, not fruitlessly, Sefior Andres!&#xD;
Senior, that is a speech more gallantly than truly spoke&#xD;
not believe that thou thickest so humbly of thy hopes,&#xD;
noble qualities which thou bring'st into the field,&#xD;
against the maidens as against the lances of Castile. I&#xD;
that our cavaliers esteem thee one of the best warn&#xD;
array, so am I sure that our ladies look upon thee wi&#xD;
which does not misbeseem thy reputation as ~ knight."&#xD;
The flattery was not lost upon the person addressed.&#xD;
in the mood to believe- every syllable; and indeed, th&#xD;
less woman, rating the judgment of her friend by her&#xD;

"Ah 1', was his reply. "But 'he who hath set his affections&#xD;
upon the bird of paradise, can giv&amp;amp; but little heed to the plum-&#xD;
age or the strains of inferior songsters."'&#xD;
His eyes again sought the pale countenance 6f the maiden&#xD;
whom.he worshipped. Her glance was equally wandering and&#xD;
sad. Nuno de Tobar saw that she was troubled. He himself&#xD;
was dissatisfied with the thoughtless play of his betrothed. He&#xD;
felt its mischievous tendency, and his friendship for Philip de&#xD;
Vasconselos made him unwilling to behold a progress on the&#xD;
part of his brother which was adverse to his own. He inter-&#xD;
fered t~ effect a diversion of the topic, which the fanciful allusion&#xD;
of Don Andres now enabled him to do without an effort.&#xD;
"Talking of birds and singing, dear Lady Olivia, reminds me&#xD;
that in the cares of the camp, and in my long term of disfavor,&#xD;
I have not enjoyed thy music for a weary seasoi~. I pray thee,&#xD;
favor us with some one of those many ditties which never come&#xD;
with due effect save from those who feel them. I would I could&#xD;
persuade thee to one of those antique ballads of El Cid; but I&#xD;
will not ask thee, remembering the flat denial which thou gayest,&#xD;
in my presence, to that fine courtier, De Sinolar, when he craved&#xD;
the ballad of Urraca, and the Moor who lost Vale~cia. Nath-&#xD;
less, some other strain, I pray thee, if it be only to persuade&#xD;
Dofia Leonora that Nuno de Tobar is not so entirely her slave&#xD;
that he dare not seek a favor at the hands of anothe~beauty. I&#xD;
trust, Selior Alidres, that thy ear, like mine, is accessible to all&#xD;
the charms of music."&#xD;
"Verily, Sefior," was the reply, "that depends entirely on the&#xD;
bird that sings. There are some whose plumage makes marvel-&#xD;
ously against their strains. That thou hast had the wit to entreat&#xD;
from the Lady Olivia that bounty which it has heen my first&#xD;
thought to solicit, is a great vexation. But I must content my~&#xD;
self now ~ith repeating thy entreaty."&#xD;
The cavaliers both looked pleadingly to Olivia as they spoke.&#xD;
But she needed no second soliciting. She was not one of those&#xD;

she was only too anxious to escape a further dialogue&#xD;
pained her something more than either of the parties&#xD;

these at work within her bosom, to prompt her to revolt at&#xD;
versation, and the diversion of Nuno de Tobar was eagerly&#xD;
upon as affording relief to troubled feelings. She had&#xD;
taken the guitar ere Don Andres had finished speaking, ai&#xD;

DON ANDRE'S THEOLOGY.&#xD;
&#xD;
51&#xD;
&#xD;
60                    VASCONSELOS.&#xD;
"How great the fear of Beauty,&#xD;
If, when ye gaul the prize,&#xD;
Ye deem no longer needful&#xD;
The grace that won her eyes?&#xD;
"Ye sing but for your mistress-&#xD;
Ye Mug not for your slave,-.&#xD;
And give no more, the-object won,&#xD;
The worship that ye gave.&#xD;
"I will not brook a perU,&#xD;
That sounds of joy the knell;&#xD;
And will not yield my heart to love,&#xD;
Because I love so well."&#xD;
The song was finished; and as the maiden laid the insti&#xD;
aside, a storm of' gentle reproaches fell upon her ear, as we&#xD;
Nuno de Tobar as from the youthful knight of Portugal.&#xD;
"Nay, nay !" exclaimed the fair Leonorade Borbadilla-&#xD;
~her not, heed her not! She think not as she sings. ~&#xD;
chosen this ballad in a perverse spirit, only to mock whal&#xD;
been saying. She is sworn in her secret heart, well&#xD;
against all such inhuman selfishness. Out upon your dame&#xD;
Amina! She was but a Moorish damsel, I trow, and h&#xD;
was given up to heathen divinities."&#xD;
"And love himself is o~e of them," said De Tobar ar&#xD;
"Not our love, Don Nuno-not the love known to (&#xD;
and before wh6se altars the true knight first buckles on h&#xD;
He hath his birth in the gay regions of Proven~e-a cava&#xD;
self, belted and spurred, with the addition of a pair of win&#xD;
you what John of Nostrodamus writes of him, and yot&#xD;
satisfied that he is not of heathen origin-a pure Christ~&#xD;
ble and a gentle-from whom eomes the religion of t1~&#xD;
knight."&#xD;
And the Portuguese chanted the original description&#xD;
ballad of the Troubadour.&#xD;

"But not of the infidel?" replied the other with a sort of ~1oly&#xD;
horror, crossing herself devoutly as she spoke.&#xD;
~, rely, but of a family that haply beheld the blessed&#xD;
ight of the Christian Church, and of~thoir own free will sought&#xD;
baptism. But the ballad I have sung comes not from the Njoor.&#xD;
~: It is pure Castilian. The damsel Amina was of the true faith."&#xD;
"Ay, lady, but she sang not wisely, knowing the wants of our&#xD;
sex, and the better virtue in her own. Her ballad is in the per-&#xD;
verse spirit of the Moor, who, with the true heaven in his eye, yet&#xD;
wilfully turned away his sight. In heart ~he was but a pagan.&#xD;
It suits the creed of one who found inns slave ~t1~e thing of his&#xD;
affections. ,Of such only is it permitted to hink ill of knighthood,&#xD;
and to stifle all the free faith in the heart of woman. It suit~ for&#xD;
reproach to a race of misbelievers, who, though they bore them-&#xD;
selves manfully enough in battle, were yet little familiar with the&#xD;
laws of Christian chivalry. The true knight loves not less the&#xD;
treasure because it hath been won. If he keeps it no longer, in&#xD;
his eye, it is because he hath conveyed it to his heart. I~ he&#xD;
boasts no longer of its beauty, it is because he fears to tempt the&#xD;
avarice of others to seek his treasure. If he sings n&amp;amp; longer in&#xD;
her praise, it is because, when he hath wholly given himself up to&#xD;
her charms, as he doth by marriage, he hath said the most in her&#xD;
honor that could be spoken. Verily, I repeat, your Amina ~va~&#xD;
but a wretched heathen in heart, cold and selfish, a her doctrine&#xD;
is only true of a people who believe with the iiifidel."&#xD;
Such was the eloquent commentary of Don Andres, conveyed&#xD;
In a manner at once spirited and graceful.&#xD;
"Thou ha~t made a right good and proper defence of thy sex&#xD;
aild mine, Don Andres," exclaimed Leonora, "and I trow thou&#xD;
wilt never lack lady's favor to grace thy helmet in the 1ie1ct~ of&#xD;
~ tourney. Thou wilt take thy part, I trust, in the tournament&#xD;
which the adelantado has appointed; thou and thy valiant brother,&#xD;
even if ye go not on the enterprise against the~ Floridian."&#xD;
With the mention of his brother, the eyes of Don Andres were&#xD;
seen suddenly to sparkle with a keen and fiery expression. Nuno&#xD;
de Tobar, knowing the conscious rivalry that existed between~ the&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;

two, watched him with interest, but said nothing. But Do~ Au-&#xD;
dres was not so forbearing.&#xD;
"Philip de Yasconselos must answer for himself," sai(jl he,&#xD;
somewhat equivocally-" we are both of us sufficiently ~i4 to&#xD;
adopt our resolutionswithout much consultation with one&#xD;
With these words he passed quickly from the subject. KEhe&#xD;
eve~ilii~ was not much longer protracted, and soon IDe Tobai' and&#xD;
his betrothed took their departure, leaving the knight of Poi1tugal&#xD;
behind them. They ~were not conscious, as they d~scende~1 the&#xD;
verandah into the groves leading from the dwelling, of the r~ove-&#xD;
ments of another~who led the way through the shady thi~l~ets.&#xD;
This was no other than Philip de Yasconselos himself. us&#xD;
not ix~iagine that he had been a li~t~ne~. He had been m~iiing&#xD;
his way to the abode of Olivia, when arrested, almost o~ the&#xD;
threshold, by the voice of his brother. He was about to ijetire,&#xD;
as he had usually done uifder the same ~circumstances.&#xD;
"Let him have all the chances," he murmured to hims~W, as&#xD;
he turned away. "He was the youngest born of our ~&#xD;
and had her fondest blessing. IV wer~ a grievous sorrow ig  e&#xD;
had not mine."&#xD;
Just then the voice of Olivia in song, detained his departing&#xD;
footsteps. He leaned sadly against a tree while he listene~I to&#xD;
the satirical ballad with which the damsel had answered th~ so&#xD;
limitations of his brother. The sentiment of the ballad was no&#xD;
less ungracious in his ears than in those of Andres; an~ yet&#xD;
there was a secret feeling of satisfaction in the heart of P~flip,&#xD;
that the ditty had been chosen in response to the prayer of a&#xD;
I.&#xD;
rival. He retired, with mingled feelings, from his place of~atch,&#xD;
as the song ended, and strolled slowly through the alleys. In a&#xD;
little while he heard the footsteps and the voices of IDe TobaF and&#xD;
his companion, behind him, and perceived, with a pang, th~t his&#xD;
brother did not accompany them. His pace was hurriedly in-&#xD;
creased. He ~elt all the delicious opportunity which Afidres&#xD;
enjoyed, and readily conjectured that it was with a special purpose&#xD;
that the latter rein~ained after the departure of her other gue~ts.&#xD;
"Well!" he murmured to himself sadly, "be it so! If he&#xD;
&#xD;
A LOVER'S QUIETUS.                  53&#xD;
hath the word with which to win her,~she is his! I will not nvy&#xD;
my brotiier. I would I had the strength to pray that he might&#xD;
be successful. He hath wronged me-he will still wrong me-.&#xD;
and I will submit. He shall find in me no~illing rival, whether&#xD;
in love or war. Our mother gave him to my care. I will 1~hink&#xD;
of her love, though he may never do justice to mine."&#xD;
The field was clear before Andres de Vasconselos. He was&#xD;
alone with the woman whom he loved. He was not~ the&#xD;
man to lose time, or daily long in a fruitless attendance a~ the&#xD;
shrine of his devotions without making his petition heard. He&#xD;
was ~one of those impetuous spirits whose fierceand eager willinthe&#xD;
assertion of its desires, is apt to blind to the prospect of defe~t-&#xD;
to all prospect save that which is beheld through the medium&#xD;
of a passionate and almost frenzied hope. Scarcely had Nuno de&#xD;
Tobar and his betrothed disappeared, before he was at. the feet&#xD;
of Olivia. But not for us to watch the progress of the brief but&#xD;
exciting scene which followed. Let it suffice that ere many&#xD;
minutes had elapsed, Andres de Vasconselos was also spee~1ing.&#xD;
away from the abode, darting headlong through the perfumed&#xD;
alleys which surrounded it, and hurrying almost madly in the&#xD;
direction of the neighboring hills.&#xD;
With his disappearance,. Don Baithazar de Alvaro~ once n~ore&#xD;
emerged from the cover of the neighboring thicket. His espio-&#xD;
nage over his niece and her visitors seems to have been continued&#xD;
throughout the evening. He had been sufficiently near, in his&#xD;
place of concealment, to behold all that had taken place, and to&#xD;
hear every syllable that was spoken. An exulting expression&#xD;
was kindled in his face, and his satisfaction at the result was audi-&#xD;
bly expressed.&#xD;
"So far it is well! He hath his quietus. I had expected this;&#xD;
but it is something to be sure. That danger is passed. There is&#xD;
yet another, and a greater! Were I as confident of the answer she&#xD;
would make to the prayer of Philip as of Andres-nay, were I&#xD;
not so confident.J should feel at rest. This accursed anxiety!&#xD;
It leaves me almost a coward. But I must arm myself for the&#xD;
worst, and against the final struggle. It will come, and I m~ist be&#xD;

prepared. Olivia de Alvaro must wed with neither of these&#xD;
knights of Portugal. Shemust wed withuone. The hour that fi~ids&#xD;
her9a bride, finds me . But it shall never come to this;&#xD;
we must baffle him, or he must perish. Both shall perish ~re&#xD;
she wed this man !"&#xD;
Did Olivia dream of the near neighborhood of her uncle all this&#xD;
while! Could she fancy what were his resolves and reflections, in&#xD;
respect to her future fate and fortune~! It might almost ~em&#xD;
that she did from the pallid features~ of her face, the big tears&#xD;
swelling in her eyes, the drooping self-abandonment with which,&#xD;
as soon as Andres de Yasc6nselos had disappeared, she suffered&#xD;
herself t&amp;amp; fall back upon the couch, her hands covering her face,&#xD;
and, as it were, seeking to stifle the deep moan of agony which&#xD;
perforce escaped from her lips. The sound reached 1~on Bal-&#xD;
thazar in his place of concealment. Slowly he receded from the&#xD;
spot and disappeared in the more distant shrubbery. He ~iad&#xD;
not the heart to meet her at that moment.&#xD;

CHAPTER~ V.&#xD;
"Uso a vedirrni&#xD;
Tremar tu sei ~ ma, pin non tremo."-ALnzrRr.&#xD;
IT was past midnight when Andres de Vasconselos returned to&#xD;
the bohio or cottage, which was occupied by his brother and him-&#xD;
self His agitation was measurably subsided,~but not his pas-&#xD;
~ions. The quiet was only upon th~ surface. A violent storm&#xD;
w~is still busy, raging in the depths of his spirit. Hi~ features&#xD;
were rigidly composed, but stern almost to ferocity, and his&#xD;
emotion was perhaps only concealed by the resolute comp~es-&#xD;
sion of his lips. It seemed as if he did not dare to trust to t~iem&#xD;
in speech. Though late, his brother had not yet retired for the&#xD;
night. Philip de Vasconselos was busily engaged wi4tin~g at the&#xD;
tableihe only one which the apartment contained. The tight&#xD;
by which he wrote was peculiar enough, however common to the&#xD;
island. It consisted of a cluster of twelve or fifteen cocuyos,.-&#xD;
that larger sort of phosphorescent insect. These were enclosed in&#xD;
a little wicker-work, or cage, made of the most delicate threads&#xD;
of gold-wire. They emitted a light, of a color brilliantly green,&#xD;
ample enough for all the purposes of the student. Philip looked&#xD;
up, at the entrance .of his brother, and discovered, at a glance,&#xD;
that his emotions had been violently aroused and agitated. He&#xD;
welcomed him, however, with a gentle~ord and smile, the an-&#xD;
swer to which was at once brief and ungracious.&#xD;
"Are you unwell, Andres'?" was the inquiry, affectionately&#xD;
made; for the elder brother was touched, rather than vexed, by&#xD;
the repulsive accents of the other.&#xD;
"And if I were, Philip de Vasconselos '?" sternly and un~atis.&#xD;
factorily replied the younger.&#xD;
"And if thou wert, Andres! This t~o me, thy brother ?"&#xD;

"Why not? Why should grief or suffering of mine concern&#xD;
thee '~ It is enough that thou hast neither."&#xD;
"Nay, Andres, that I myself am free from cares and sorrows&#xD;
would be good reason only why I. should seek to bring some&#xD;
remedy to thine. But there is yet another cause for my anxiety.&#xD;
The epistle, my brother, which is now growing beneath&#xD;
hands especially reminds me of my duty to succor and to corn-.&#xD;
t thee. It is a ktter to our mother, Andres; and I am even&#xD;
now about to speak of thy health and happiness."&#xD;
"What warrant hast thou for assuming either? What know-.&#xD;
est thou of my happiness or health ?"&#xD;
"Nay, Andrea, that thou h~t vigorous and youthful health,&#xD;
may not be denied. All who behc4d thee, speak loudly of thy&#xD;
full cheek, thy elastic form, and the brightness of thine eye; and&#xD;
these things speak for thy happiness als% It is vain to declare&#xD;
the presence of a grief which leaves the beauty and vigor of the&#xD;
form unwanted and untouched. Surely, my brother, thou art&#xD;
imot unhappy?"&#xD;
"Why troubles thou me with such questions, Philip? Write&#xD;
to. our mother whatever it pleaseth thee to write. Soy what thou&#xD;
wilt. It matters but little to me what thou sayest 1"&#xD;
"Bi~t it matters much to her, Andres," replied ti2e other,&#xD;
somewhat reproachfully. "Besides, I dare not speak to our&#xD;
mother indifferently of him, her favorite son, whom she so corn..&#xD;
mended especially to my affection as a~ younger brother."&#xD;
"Philip de Yasconsel~s, both thou a~d our mother have~ei'red&#xD;
greatly when ye claim to believe that I need guardianship. I&#xD;
tell thee, Sefior, I am, like thyself; a man,-and fully capable of&#xD;
taking care of my own health and fortunes."&#xD;
The reply to this rude speech was full of a sad solemnity.&#xD;
"Something hath vexed thee, Andres, making the4 unjust to&#xD;
thy brother and ungrateful to the tender fondness of thy mother&#xD;
for thy youth. Thou wi~t find it less easy, when thou recoveries&#xD;
thy calm of temper, to forgive thyself than to procure her for-&#xD;
giveness or mine. I will finish my letter, making my own&#xD;
report of thy condition, which, until this hour, Andres, hath&#xD;
&#xD;
seemed to all the island, as to myself; such as it would be most&#xD;
grateful to any mother to beh6ld or know."&#xD;
"As thou wilt; and yet !-Look at me, Philip de Vasconselos!&#xD;
-look at me, ere thou writes down any delusive falsehood f~or&#xD;
my mother's eyes! Look I like one whom th~ Gods have&#xD;
marked for happiness ?"&#xD;
He approacfled the table as he spoke, and grasped, with some&#xD;
violence, the hand that held the pen. The eyes of the brothers&#xD;
encountered. Those of Andres were blood-shot, full of rage,&#xD;
and expressive of a fury that seemed about to break through 91&#xD;
restraint. Philip rose, as he caught the fearful expression in the&#xD;
other's face. His o'~n features were calm and firm, but filled&#xD;
with a tender concern and. sympathy, such as spoke for the gen-&#xD;
tle and nobl attachment with which the elder brother regarded&#xD;
the younger, and the favorite of their mother.&#xD;
"Andres," he said, "I know not that I an~wisej-or like to be&#xD;
successful in sking thy confidence. Of late thou hast seemed to&#xD;
regard me r ther as an enemy than a brother -"&#xD;
"Thou art! Thou art !" was the wild and reckless answer.&#xD;
"Nay, I c nnot answer thee, Andres, by any assurance in&#xD;
words. It l~ecomes not me patiently to strive to disprove thy&#xD;
injustice. I ~ook upon such speech as a sort of madness, on thy&#xD;
part, rather than a wrong done to met Enough, that I tell thee&#xD;
I am here, re~tdy, as thou ~hast always~ found me before, to serve&#xD;
thy cause, to help thy progress, to fight thy battles-if need&#xD;
be&#xD;
"I ask not thy help in battle, Philip de Vasconselos. I am&#xD;
equal to my own danger. But thou art willing to help my pry-&#xD;
gress---to serve my cause ?-llow sayest ?-Eh !"&#xD;
"Yea! with all my strength, and all my heart I" was the eager&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
" Hearken! wilt thou deign then to seek on my behalf; and to&#xD;
solicit from Don Balthazar de Alvaro, the hand of his niece in&#xD;
marriage? Wilt thou do this, Philip de Vasconselos ?"&#xD;
"Verily, o~' a truth will I do this, if the lady hath authorized&#xD;

cents.&#xD;
"If the lady hath authorized the&amp;amp;to solicit !" was the mocking&#xD;
repetition of the infuriate young man: "Go to, Philip de Vas-&#xD;
conselos, I well kndw that thou wouldst not, ay, thou couldst&#xD;
not, serve me in this. Would I need to solicit the favor of the&#xD;
uncle, were I sure of the favor of his niece ?"&#xD;
"Thou wouldst surely not seek the one, were the other denied&#xD;
thee'?"&#xD;
"Not through thy eloquence, surely, Senor Don Philip, lest&#xD;
thou shouldst haply forget thy client's claims in the prosecution&#xD;
of thy own."&#xD;
"Andres, my brother," said the other calmly, but with a stern-&#xD;
er show of expression than had before been apparent in his coun-&#xD;
tenance,-" it~ will not be easy to make me angry with thee. It&#xD;
is in thy madness that thou dost me this, gross injustice,-and I&#xD;
forgive it. But let us speak no m~ in regard to this matter.&#xD;
It needs not that I should tell thea what thou seemest already to&#xD;
understand, that my affections have been placed, as well as thine,&#xD;
upon the same lovely lady. I deny not this, though I have deem-&#xD;
e~i it only proper that I should be silent on the subject, seeing thy&#xD;
secret in the same moment with mine own. It is surely our mis~&#xD;
fortune that we have so loved. But I resolved, from the moment&#xD;
when I discovered of hy affections, that the field should&#xD;
be ope~i to thee from any o struction of mine. I stood not in&#xD;
thy way. I offered no rivalship to thee,-and, while thou hast&#xD;
nightly sought the dwelling of the Lady Olivia, it was enough for&#xD;
me to know that such was the 'course of thy footsteps, to turn&#xD;
mine in the opposite direction. This very night, when I learned&#xD;
that thou wast her guest, I left the garden of the lady-"&#xD;
"Ha! thou wast there,-and thou hast heard'?" was the inter-&#xD;
ruption.&#xD;
"I have heard nothing! When I found the verandah occupied&#xD;
by thyself and Nuno de Tobar, with his betrothed, I turned&#xD;
away~ in silence, seeking nothing farther. I left thee to thy own&#xD;

"Thou still wrong'st me, Andres I', mildly.&#xD;
"Perhaps, perhaps !-do I not even wrong myself as well as&#xD;
thpe? We will speak no more of this. Enough, that the field&#xD;
lies before thee-that I cross thy path no longer-that I go&#xD;
on the expedition with De Soto-and as, most likely, thou wilt&#xD;
be. successful where I have failed, so thou wilt remain here, and&#xD;
we will cast our shadows no more upon each other. Write this to&#xD;
out mother, and say to her that my soul is now wholly yielded&#xD;
to the ambition of conquest. Tell her what thou wilt of those&#xD;
dreams of Dorado, which woo the adventurer to the wilds of the&#xD;

"Brother&#xD;
"Think not that I would wrong thee, Philip. Is it not enough&#xD;
that even in my passion and my pang, I acknowledge thy forbear-&#xD;

"But I know not this, Andres; I have never spoken word of&#xD;
love or tenderness to the Lady Olivia."&#xD;
"But thou wilt speak both; and she  hear thee, and respond&#xD;
to thee in accents like thine own. No  re of this, lest I grow&#xD;
wild and foolish, and curse thee, Phihi or thy better fortune."&#xD;
"Nay, thoi~ shalt not, brother" and he threw his arms tenderly&#xD;
about the unreasonable youth, who submitted but only for a mo-&#xD;
ment to~the embrace; he shook himself free from it in the next&#xD;
Instant. Philip's eyes followed him with a deep and melancholy&#xD;
Interest, full of sorrow and affection, as he saw him preparing&#xD;
once more to leave tl~e cabin.&#xD;
"Whither go you, my-brother, at this late hour ?"&#xD;
"Forth! Forth o cc more into the night !"&#xD;
"Nay, Andres; ere it not better thou shouldst seek for&#xD;

"I cann t sleep! Thou knowest not what a stifling fullness&#xD;
harbors he e-and here !" was the reply of Andres, smitinglais&#xD;
head and osom as he spoke. "I must hurry forth! I must,&#xD;
have air a d solitude !"&#xD;
With t ese words he disappeared from the cabin. Philip de&#xD;
Va conselos followed him to the door, and his~ eye~ anxiously&#xD;
pur ued t e retreating form by the imperfect starlight, until it&#xD;
had wholly gone from sight. The elder brother then returned~to&#xD;
the table, here, seating himself, he rested his cheek upon his&#xD;
pal , and sunk into a fit of melancholy, which was of mixed&#xD;
cha acter, t once pleasing and painful. The perverse and will-&#xD;
ful ride o his brother, his suspicious and jealous temper, must&#xD;
nec ssarily have been productive of great grief to one by whom&#xD;
he as ear estly beloved; but it was in~ vain that Philip. de Yas-&#xD;
con elos tr ed to stifle the feeling of satisfaction which enlivened&#xD;
and please tly ag4ated his bosom, as he thought of the rejec-&#xD;
tion by Oh ia do Alvaro of his brother's suit. Love is certainly&#xD;
one of the ost selfish and exacting of all the passions in the heart&#xD;
of youth; perhaps because it is the passion which most corn.&#xD;
pletely abs rbs and swallows i~p the rest. Philip was really&#xD;
fond of A dres; fond of him by reason of natural sympathies,&#xD;
as a broth r; fond of .him by habit and as.sociation-.-fond of&#xD;
all thatwas manly in his character-.-proud~ of his spirit and youth-&#xD;

ularly so, , for so long a time, he had been the guardian of his&#xD;
youth and fortunes. But his heart reproached ~him for the still&#xD;
grateful fee ing of satisfaction, which he vainly endeavored to sub-&#xD;
due, and w ~ch continually reminded him that, in . this quarter,&#xD;
there was* o lotiger an obstacle to his own successes. It ~was&#xD;
to overco e this thought that he proceeded to resume the letter&#xD;
which he h d beenwritingtohismotherwhenAndres had first made&#xD;
his appear nce. A few additional lines only were written, when&#xD;
he flung th reed from him and closed the portfolio. His nerv-&#xD;

of the spirit. He went once more to the entrance of the cabin,&#xD;
and soliloquized, as if his brother were still in sight.&#xD;
"Unhappy child of passion ! forever erring and repenting-only&#xD;
to repeat thy error; what a destiny is thine! How shall I watch&#xD;
and save thee, when it is ever thus, that some c~uel suspicion, the&#xD;
offspring of thy wild temper and fierce will, continually begets&#xD;
thy hostility against the hand that is outstretched in thy service!&#xD;
Thou wilt go with Hernan de Soto, and it may be that I shall&#xD;
not 1e with thee. Ha! Is this, then, a doubt? Is it so certain that&#xD;
mine shall be a better fortune with Olivia de Alvaro than was&#xD;
thine? She has refused thee,-thou, as brav~, as noble, as come-&#xD;
ly as any of the ge~atlemen of Castile! Will sEe be more likely&#xD;
to hearken me? It is possible; and I have a hope, a hope in&#xD;
which I gladden-though I shame to own it,-based upon a broth-&#xD;
er's denial and defeat! Is there reason for this hope? Do I&#xD;
~not delude myself-does not Nuno de Tobar, when he encour-&#xD;
ages my passion, does he not delude me also? The thought&#xD;
that I too shall be scorned, makes it easy to pardon the violent&#xD;
passions of my p~or Andres. Well! We shall shortly see!&#xD;
Now that he no longer pursues the quest, it will be for me to&#xD;
know what is my fate. A few days, and it may be that I also&#xD;
go with thee, my brother, into the wild forests of the Apalachian.&#xD;
And yet, were there other fields of venture, Hernan de Soto&#xD;
should have no help of mine. He hath favored, rather than&#xD;
frowned upon, these jealousies of his Spanish followers. They&#xD;
hold me in their h~te, if not their disesteem; and envy me the&#xD;
very skill and knowledge upon which they build somewhat for&#xD;
their h9pe of succ~ss. Let Olivia but smile upon my prayer,&#xD;

~vas set down firmly a d fearlessly, and his lips parted&#xD;
peasantt catch of Ca . ian song, as he di~ew near the&#xD;

passions of her own heart, and took no heed of exter-&#xD;

poke to her, yet she heard him not. He paused quiet-&#xD;
irveyed her. Very peculiar was the character of that&#xD;
tich he bestowed upon the lovely outline and perfect&#xD;
the features within his gaze. It might be pride and&#xD;
L, such as a father feels beholding the unsurpassable&#xD;
f a favorite daughter. But there was something still&#xD;
~quivocal in the expression of~his features. There was&#xD;
[ous significance in that look, at once of steady and&#xD;
~ct watch, yet of eagerness and satisfaction, which baffled&#xD;
sity that it continued to provoke. Some moments&#xD;
~umed in this serpent-like gaze, and all the while she&#xD;
absolutely unconscious of his presence. She was only&#xD;

aroused from this unconsciousness as he sat himself quietly be.&#xD;
side her, and folding his arms about her waist; lifted her with an&#xD;
air of great affection in his embrace. Then it was that she&#xD;
started, looked wildly about h or a moment, and then, distin-&#xD;
guishing the intruder, fixed upon him a countenance expressive&#xD;
of any feeling but that of tenderness or regard. In an instant&#xD;
the full, quick, keen vitality, came like a flood of light into her&#xD;
great dark eyes; her lips quivered,, and were suddenly closed&#xD;
fast, as if with sudden resolution. She started from the cush-&#xD;
ions, and shook herself free from his grasp, as if he had been a&#xD;
viper.&#xD;
"You!,' she exclaimed in a tone of suspicion and appehen-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"Even so, Olivia. Who else'? But what now'? Why this&#xD;
passion'? What has vexed you'? What startles you'?"&#xD;
How long have you been here'?" she asked wildly.&#xD;
"But this moment," he answered: "I thought you slept."&#xD;
She drew a deep sigh, as if suddenly relieved.&#xD;
"It is late," she said; "I will retire."&#xD;
"Late! what of that'? Have you any cares for to-morrow'?&#xD;
Sit, my beauty, and tell us who have been your guests-who&#xD;
hath been here'? What are your tidings'?"&#xD;
"I have none," she answered coldly and timidly, still moving&#xD;
to retire.&#xD;
"Now, saints and demons! what is in the child I" he ex-&#xD;
claimed, as he endeavorEd once more to detain her in his grasp.&#xD;
She shrunk from him with a visible shudder. A heavy scowl&#xD;
passed over his forehead, and he spoke with closed teeth.&#xD;
"What! .~till in thy Biscayan temper'? Nay,, nay, my pre-&#xD;
cious one, thou shalt not leave me thus."&#xD;
"Suffer me to go, uncle," she entreated, as he caught her hand.&#xD;
"Why, so I will, when thou hast answered me what has put&#xD;
thee in this temper again'? Methought, when I left thee last, that&#xD;
thou hadst been sobered-hadst -grown wiser. What has&#xD;
w~gught thee into this passion, at a moment when brave cava-&#xD;
Ue~s grow humble in thy train'? Or dost thou repent thee for&#xD;
&#xD;
A WATCHFUL PROTECTOR.                  65&#xD;
having dis isseA with denial this famous young gallant of Por-&#xD;
tugal?"&#xD;
What a change in her aspect followed this speech from his&#xD;
lips! But a moment before she exhibited aversion, but it was&#xD;
coupled wi timidity and a feeble, tearful apprehension. In a&#xD;
moment th timidity wa~ gone-the tear-the apprehension.&#xD;
Her eyes fi shed full with indignation as she replied&#xD;
"What! thou hast again descended to the office of the spy'?&#xD;
Thou hast nce more placed thyself in secret watch upon my&#xD;
actions'?"&#xD;
"Not up n thy actions, child-not upon thee, but upon those&#xD;
who approa h thee. I know thy danger from these gallants, and&#xD;
it is in de ree as I fear them, my Olivia, that I keep watch&#xD;
over thee, a thy guardian-thy protector, child-"&#xD;
He renewed the attempt to take her hand as he spoke.&#xD;
* "Touch e not," she cried. "Oh, wolf assigned to keep the&#xD;
lamb!"&#xD;
"What wouldst thou have, child'? It is surely needful that&#xD;
I hold ever resent in mind the treasure that I am set to keep."&#xD;
"Oh, fien ! and thou smil'st as thou speak'st thus dreadfully."&#xD;
"Nay, na , not a fiend, Olivia, only, I grant you, not exactly&#xD;

"Thou sl dearest thy race."&#xD;
"No, trul , no. Most guardians, having such precious treasure&#xD;
in their keejj~ing, would take care of it as I have done. Have I&#xD;
not kept thee well, my child-as tenderly, as closely? Shall&#xD;
others rob ~ne of the treasure before mine own eyes'? Ah,&#xD;

to thee now, ~at thou shouldst add a sting to a sorrow'? If to&#xD;
thee I owe t~ie loss of hope, why jibe me ever with this loss'?&#xD;
Why hold l4efore mine eyes the terrible picture of the woe&#xD;

&#xD;
"Nay, I would not mock thee, Olivia. I but ~peak to thee the&#xD;
language of a sober truth. I do, indeed, love thee, my child-.&#xD;
love thee as my own-would have thee ever as mine own, and&#xD;
thou mightst s~e in this fondness the secret of that distrust which&#xD;
dogs the heels of all others. Give not way to this blindness and&#xD;
madness, which can profit neither thee nor me, and see the love&#xD;
which I feel for thee, my child I"&#xD;
"Peace! Peace! thou maddenest me when thou tallest to&#xD;
me of thy love !"&#xD;
"A truce to thy passion, Olivia. Thou art not wise in its&#xD;
indulgence. It spoils thy beauty. It takes too much from thy&#xD;
charm of face, as it disturbs the peace of thy heart. Thus ruffled,&#xD;
thouremind'stmepainfully of thy Biscayanmother, who was fiercer&#xD;
in her wrath than the hurricane of these tropic countries. She&#xD;
would suddenly grow convulsed like thyself; with a tempest that&#xD;
threatened everything with destruction; but she was not, as thou&#xD;
art, capable of soothing all down again to the most beautiful&#xD;
repose I"&#xD;
"Her passion were much the most fitting to mate with thine!&#xD;
0! would that she were here! Mother! 0! mother! Where&#xD;
art thou now? See'st thou thy child-into what hands-into&#xD;
what fate she has fallen-without hope-as one who drowns,&#xD;
with all the seas upon him, and no strength to struggle upward&#xD;
into lif&amp;amp;?"&#xD;
She threw herself once more upon the cushions of the divan,&#xD;
her face downward. One single sob escaped her, but one, for&#xD;
* at that moment the hand of Don Balthazar, in seeming tender-&#xD;
ness, was placed upon her neck. His touch seemed to recall the&#xD;
more fiery feeling with which she had at first received him. She&#xD;
started up, and repulsed him with a spasmodic fierceness.&#xD;
"Thy touch is like so much poison! Beware, lest I go mad!&#xD;
Thou wilt drive me too far, as if thou hadst not already driven me&#xD;
to perdition! Canst thou not pity-wilt thou not spare me? I&#xD;
have been weak-I know that I am weak still-b:at I feel that 1&#xD;
have a strength in me that may become fearful for mischief; if&#xD;
not for good. Uzicle, it were~better, far better, ere you rouse&#xD;
&#xD;
that strength into exercise, that you should drive your dagger&#xD;
into both of ~ur hearts."&#xD;
The brow ~f Don Balthazar was contracted; but a determined&#xD;
effort dissipa~ed the cloud. His rOle was that of conciliation.&#xD;
He was not unwilling to acknowledge and to respects that fearful&#xD;
strength which she asserted herself to possess, though latent. He&#xD;
felt that he had gone too far. He had given her no credit for&#xD;
that character~ of which she was now making a fearful exhibition.&#xD;
Nor, indeed, had he hitherto found any reason to suspect the&#xD;
presence of such fierce energies. She had hitherto borne her-&#xD;
self so mildly, if not feebly, that he had come rather to slight, if&#xD;
not to despise, the weakness of a nature, which had been almost&#xD;
wholly controlled by his superior will. That he had been so&#xD;
successful hitherto, in this respect, was due to causes already&#xD;
glanced at-the seclusion of her mode of life, her extreme youth,&#xD;
and her imperfect e ucation. The instincts of her heart, suddenly&#xD;
springing into birth, had opened to her eyes a new survey, and&#xD;
filled her soul with consciousness not less overwhelming and&#xD;
oppressive than stra ge. He was beginning to discover the full&#xD;
extent of her develop ments, when it was perhaps too late. Re-&#xD;
garding her as a chil ,a~pliant creature in his hands, he had but.&#xD;
too much given way to that satirical temper which marked his&#xD;
character, It was n w his aim to soothe. He was not practiced&#xD;
in this art, but he s piously addressed himself to the endeavor.&#xD;

I prize that dutiful a section which alone, I doubt not, has caused&#xD;
thee to dismiss this oung and insolent knight of Portugal."&#xD;
"Dutiful affection !" she exclaimed, interrupting him with a&#xD;
bitter look and acce , which effectually interpreted into scornful&#xD;
irony the two words which she had borrowed from his speech.&#xD;
"And was it not t is, Olivia ?"&#xD;

ledge thou hast gained has been fatal to all my hopes. Thou&#xD;
knowest that I owe t1~ee. neither duty nor affection-that, if any-&#xD;
thing, I owe thee ha e only-an unforgiving hate that should*&#xD;
dream of nothing but revenge. But I have no such dream.&#xD;
Give nie but peace-such peace, at least, as may spring from&#xD;
thy forbearance, and if I meet thee with smiles no longer, I shall&#xD;
at least assail thee with no reproaches. I rejected the suit of&#xD;
Don Andres de Vasconselos simply because- alas! why&#xD;
should I furnish thee with a reason for this rejection? Enough,&#xD;
that it was with no regard to thy interests, or thy desires, that&#xD;
I was moved to decline his prayer.&#xD;
"And yet, that thou didst so, is a great gain to me, as well as&#xD;
to Do Soto. Failing thee and thy hacienda, this knight will now&#xD;
be ready to seek for a slower fortune amongst the Apalachian&#xD;
of Florida. We had lost him but for this. He and his brother&#xD;
both-that more wily adventurer-had~ set earnest eyes upon&#xD;
thy possessions. I doubt not that they knew well the number&#xD;
of thy slaves and acres, and the exact annual product of thy&#xD;
jancis.&#xD;
"Oh! be silentSefior-be. silent, for very shame. It befits&#xD;
not thee, least of all, to impute such sordid passions to these&#xD;
noble gentlemen."&#xD;
Even at this moment, when fully convinced of the necessity of&#xD;
conciliation, and really desirous not to offend, the habitual sneer&#xD;
of the uncle obtained the ascendency.&#xD;
"And thou persuades thyself-though I wonder not-that it&#xD;
is thy charms alone which have wrought upon the affections of&#xD;
these knights of Portugal."&#xD;
The sarcasm smote sharply on the woman sensibilities of the&#xD;
damsel. She replied instantly:&#xD;
"I think not of it! I would that I could think of neither them&#xD;
nor thee. Small pleasure, indeed, do I find in thinking of thee,&#xD;
and smaller the. profit, in such condition as is mine, in giving&#xD;

-he carefully adapted his speech to the task of soothing. In&#xD;
some measure he succeeded. She grew calmer, and milder, and&#xD;
he now approached her where she sat upon the divan, and with-&#xD;
out interruption, save from her sobs occasionally, continued. the&#xD;
glozing speech which was to quiet her anger. She answered him&#xD;
but seldom, and then capriciously-sometimes with tears only,&#xD;
and again with some burst of indignant speech, that drove him&#xD;
back to his first positions.&#xD;
"Oh! why wilt thou, dearest Olivia, give way to these pas-&#xD;
sionate phrensies'? of what profit to conjure up such wild and&#xD;
gloomy reflections'? They nothing help your situation or mine.&#xD;
They restore us nothing that is lost, but .t~nd rather to embitter&#xD;

-to spare when we can&#xD;

"I feel that I deserve thy chiding; but, dearest child, I will do&#xD;
better. I will give thee no cause for anger henceforward. Only&#xD;
be merciful.-I owe thee much, Olivia,-much for the past.-&#xD;
That thou hast sent off this young gallant with denial, leaves me&#xD;
to-night with a light heart."&#xD;
"And mine! mine is breaking 1"-was the wild finish which&#xD;
her lips sobbed out at the conclusion of his sentence. The deep&#xD;
despairing agony of her manner admirably suited the language&#xD;
of her lips.&#xD;
"Nay, nay, my child; not so! The world is but begun with&#xD;
thee. There is sunshine for thee, and flowers in abundance. Thou&#xD;
wilt forget-"&#xD;
"Never! never! Oh! would it could break, break at once,&#xD;
that I may feel no more this terrible struggle-this pang that is&#xD;
worse than death! But its doom is not to break. There must&#xD;
be more agonies. I must undergo many deaths,-and that blight&#xD;

so sublimely fearful. Her great flashing eyes, lighting up the&#xD;
paleness of her cheeks-her widely distended nostril, her lofty&#xD;
and erect figure, and the wild but beautiful action of her frame,&#xD;
actually seemed to confound and overwhelm her companion. He&#xD;

little measure in her anger as her fierce Biscayan mother. Yet&#xD;
how lately hath this sc~rt of fury developed itself in her., How&#xD;
wonderfully to-night did she resemble her. There was the same&#xD;
dark, fiery eye, sending out ~udden flashes; the same sudden&#xD;
swelling of the great v~in across her forehead, till it seemed big&#xD;
to bursting; the same show of the teeth, gleaming white, close&#xD;
set, and gnashing at moments the thin lips that seemed to part&#xD;
and turn over, like those of a hungry tiger. What a resemblance!&#xD;
I never saW the like before. Yet, when I beheld the likeness,&#xD;
that~ I should have dealt in the old sarcasm; that I should not&#xD;
have forborne. I should have known enough of the mother, to&#xD;
have waited for the moment of her exhaustion. Who takes the&#xD;
fish will do wisely n~t to thwart him in the struggle. W~hy&#xD;
should he not sti~uggle, ~since it avails nothing against his capture?&#xD;
He is ~o much the soo~ier in the toils. Let him beat the water&#xD;
while he lists, until it becomes easier to die than to strive. Such&#xD;
is the true art of deali4g with women in their passion, especially&#xD;
when they carry tempers of such intensity. It is in her exhaus-&#xD;
tion only that she yiel4ls; and the exhaustion comes the sooner&#xD;

his! I would not clean* e the bright steel which his blood had&#xD;
tainted. I preferred th~t the stains shouldforever remind me of&#xD;
my triumph at tl~e last ;-ay, in the moment when he fondly&#xD;
fancied he had all to himself the happiness which.he had despoiled&#xD;
of! He, at least enjoyed it only in his dreams !"&#xD;
The door opened. T~he soliloquy was arrested. He restored&#xD;
the dagger to its sheath, and looked up at the intruder.. This&#xD;
was an old woman of about sixty, a mestizo, a cross of the negro&#xD;
and the red-man. She ~ombined, in very equal degree, the iiiost&#xD;
conspicuous characteristics of the two. She had the high cheek&#xD;
bones, the thin lips, the full chin, the glossy dark flowing hair of&#xD;
the Indian, with the rel+eating forehead and flat nose of the black.&#xD;
Tier eyes were of the sly, sharp, gipsy cast, the brows quite gray,&#xD;
and thus in singular co~ftrast with her hair, which was quite as&#xD;
black as in the days of ~ier childhood ;-if; indeed, days of child-&#xD;
hood had ever been kno~Yn to her! She had not the appearance of&#xD;
one who had ever been child. The wear and tear of vexing pas-&#xD;
sions had scarred her fare with every sign of premature old age.&#xD;
Her skin was a series ofi wrinkles, like the ripples of spent billows&#xD;
upon a gradually rising shore. Her teeth were gone, with the&#xD;
exception of a couple of very sharp snags, that stood out in&#xD;
front, between her thin lips, like those of a squirrel. She had no&#xD;
flesh. upon her bones, t~nd her clothes, thin and light, according&#xD;
with climate and season, hung upon her skeleton form as if from&#xD;
a peg upon the wall! A gauze handkerchief; wrapped imper-&#xD;
fectly abov~ her neck, ~uffered her skinny bosom to appear, but&#xD;
without increasing her attractions. Her figure, thus betraying&#xD;
the signs of age, was yet singularly erect. Her step was firm,&#xD;
though stealthy. You saw that she set her foot down firmly,&#xD;
though. you did not h~ar it; and, though moving with caution,&#xD;
she was yet quick of movementt. She did not wait for a sum-.&#xD;
mons, but advanced at ~nce to her master, and stood up before&#xD;
him; her eyes lighting {zp beneath the gray brows, like lamps of&#xD;
naphtha in sepulchral caverns.&#xD;
"~~.Give me som~ wine, Anita," was his first salutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
She brought it&#xD;

"There is something~ more. Are yowsure, Anita, that she has&#xD;
not found you sleeping? Are you sure that you have not hap-&#xD;

"No !"&#xD;
"Well! I am sure that she has made some discovery! The&#xD;
question is what ?-and how much? She knows the worst-that&#xD;
is certain."&#xD;
The woman grinned.&#xD;
"But does she know by what means we have worked? You&#xD;
say she eats and drinks little. Is this only the lack of appetite,&#xD;
or does she suspect he~r food ?"&#xD;
The woman avowea her ignorance.&#xD;
"But she ate and drank yesterday ?"&#xD;
"Yes; but very litt~le."&#xD;
~J2~id she seem affected afterwards ?"&#xD;
"Very little! She was drowsy. She took her siesta; but&#xD;
when I came in to loo~,t at her, she rbse up."&#xD;
"Can she have become accustomed t'o it already? Does it&#xD;
cease to affect her? ~Tou must increase the dose, Anita."&#xD;
"It may kill her !"&#xD;
"Hardly! How much do you give her now 'P'&#xD;
The woman took a small phial from her bosom and held it up&#xD;
to the light. It contained a slightly greenish liquor. She desig..&#xD;
nated, with her finger ~1pon the phial, the quantity given.&#xD;
"That should be enough, certainly! But if she refuses the&#xD;
draught-rejects the food! That is the question. The next&#xD;
question is, whether she refuses from want of appetite, simply?&#xD;
You must change the food, Anita. Tempt her appetite. Get&#xD;
some new dishes, and forbear the drug, until her suspicions, if&#xD;
she have any, ar~ quieted ;-.--.say, for the next three days. Mean..&#xD;
while, be vigilant, and see, that you are not surprised. You note&#xD;

"Very true; but you remember that, when her Biscayan&#xD;
mother was aroused t9 ~passion, she had i~o prudence! She re-&#xD;
vealed every thing! It will be so with Olivia. I am sure of it,&#xD;
from what I have seen to-night. That is our danger. Let her,&#xD;
in this parox~rsm, be assured that all her hopes of this Portu-&#xD;
guese knight depend on escape from us, and she will rush into&#xD;
the marketplace with all her secrets! She will destroy herself&#xD;
in the fQry which would destroy us. And, Anita, if she can win&#xD;
belief; she will not so surely destroy herself. We know that she&#xD;
is guiltless, in her soul, of any crime ;-we know that the whole&#xD;
wrong is ours&#xD;
"Yes; but the shame V'&#xD;

heart. Say but the word~--.--.--."&#xD;
The dark-souled man shuddered, as he heard, and saw the&#xD;
fierce, eager, intense glare of the speaker's eyes. He said hur-.&#xD;
"No! Anita! no! I will not that. I will that she should&#xD;
live-iive---yes !-.-the time is not yet come 1,'&#xD;
"It is as you say! Yet had I not forborne to give her this&#xD;
poison, but that thou hadst in thy power a more terrible death!&#xD;
I had rather thou shouldst slay her-thou, of her own blood:--.&#xD;
and I saw thee do it."&#xD;
" I slay her, Anita! Thou art mad! I tell thee, I would not&#xD;
touch her life, for the world, if "&#xD;
"Ay, W-if she saves thee not the danger and the trouble. But&#xD;
It was the life of the heart and the hope, and the woman that I&#xD;
beheld thee bent to slay, and thy poison was so much more fatal&#xD;
than mine! Ha! ha! ha!"&#xD;
*"Oh! get thee hence, Anita! The wine begins to work in thee.&#xD;
But help thyself to another goblet, and to sleep now. Thy watch&#xD;
has been a weary one."&#xD;
The woman yawned at the suggestion, filled the goblet, drank,&#xD;
and was about to retire without a word, when she seemed to re-&#xD;
collect, and again spoke, as usual, in those low, subdued tones,&#xD;
which, when employed to utter passionate language, are so sin-.&#xD;
gularly impressive.&#xD;
"Do not forget Mateo! let me see him once more-bring him&#xD;
to me-and I will drug for thee a thousand lives I"&#xD;
Balthazar took her hand and wrung it warmly, nodded his head&#xD;
affirmatively, but said nothing. The woman went away, without&#xD;
obeisance or farther nod.&#xD;

prostration, of the object of her quest, or of the agony that&#xD;
preyed upon her; asked not, in language, for the peace and se-&#xD;
curity which she sought, but lay at length, her humility and grief&#xD;
apparent only in the one action, as if with the conviction that&#xD;
all her woes were known; her contrition; the shame from which&#xD;
she suffered; the faint hope which she dared not encourage; the&#xD;
fond passion, which. she felt to be pure as grateful, but whh~h her&#xD;
conscience bade her not to entertain. She did not once look up&#xD;
to the be* and blessing features of that Mother of Love and&#xD;
Mercy, whose eyes; she yet felt, were looking sweetly and ten-&#xD;
derly down, even into the secret recesses of her own full and&#xD;
bursting heart. And thus she lay, prone, motionless, as if her&#xD;
life and breathing had ceased in the utter prostration of her hope&#xD;
and person.&#xD;
There is something very touching in the spectacle c~f a person&#xD;
totally ignorant of religion as a subject of thought and examina-&#xD;
tion, who yet welcomes it~ as a faith; who believes with sponta-&#xD;
neous consent; who receives it as a mystery; seeks not to ana-&#xD;

degree of faith and sympathy which .1 need in my present&#xD;
strait?" The inquiry was a natural one. Every young damsel&#xD;
inclines to put trust in her waiting maid, and in this relation&#xD;
Juana stood to her mistress. But the latter had too long had&#xD;
experience of the characteristics of the maid-servant. She&#xD;
was ~not ignorant of her cunning, but she had~ good reason to&#xD;
believe that this was all pledged to the service of her uncle,&#xD;
through the medium of the old hag Anita, who was the grand-&#xD;
mother of the girl. As for her affections and sympathies, these&#xD;
Olivia had never yet been able to awaken. She had been indul-&#xD;
gent and considerate; had bestowed her gifts freely, but beyond&#xD;
the single moment in which they were bestowed, she had no&#xD;
proof that the benefit was remembered with gratitude. The&#xD;
blank, indifferent, stolid features which she surveyed were full of&#xD;
discouragement, and after a brief examination of them, the un-&#xD;
hapjy damsel, with a sigh, averted her eyes, abandoned her pur-&#xD;
pose of solicitation-if she had entertained any-and submitted&#xD;
to be disrobed in profound silence. The girl was not disposed to&#xD;
bi~eak this silence. She performed' her task drowsily. It was&#xD;
n~t a protracted one: and this done, she' retired for the night,&#xD;
leaving her mistress alone, once more, to commune with her&#xD;
own sorrows;&#xD;
91           "There is no h\ope !" she exclaimed~ mournfully, sitting in her&#xD;
night dres~ where the maid had left her, her hands folded. upon&#xD;
her lap, ani her moist eyes looking vacantly up at the Virgin&#xD;
wit an expression of the most woeful self-abandonment.&#xD;
"Yet why should.1 hope! What is there to hope? What&#xD;
have I to live for? The light is gone, the love! I dare not&#xD;

produced into fruits even; the integrity of which one would sup-&#xD;
pose could not be invaded unless by some external proofs being&#xD;
appar4t. In this way only could she account for the dreamy&#xD;
and pr6strating moods which she had occasionally' felt during the&#xD;
day. Here, then, was a young woman, of bigh birth, proud con-&#xD;
nections, and ample fortune, an unsuspected prisoner in her :own&#xD;
dwelling, denied, virtually, the necessary aliment of life. Truly&#xD;
the case was a pitiable one !-Olivia de AWaro, sustained during&#xD;
all the scenes in which we lave beheld her, chiefly by the intens-&#xD;
ity of her excitements, was now near to fainting from absolute&#xD;
want of food.&#xD;
The cravings of nature were not to be withstood. She rose&#xD;
from her prostrate position; seizing her lamp, which she shaded&#xD;
carefully with a handkerchief on all sides but one, she cautiously&#xD;
opened the door of her chamber and entered upon the passage&#xD;
which, more or less directly, conducted to almost every apart.&#xD;
ment in the house. Adjoining her own was a small room,&#xD;
not much more than a closet, which had been assigned to the&#xD;
waiting maid Juana. Into this she looked boldly; intending, if&#xD;
the girl were yet awake, to speak to her of some object, any&#xD;
but that which she really had in view. But the girl, as she ex-&#xD;
pected, from a previous knowledge ~of her habits, already slept&#xD;
profoundly. She closed the door cautiously behind her, and,&#xD;
with feet set down carefully, she stole along the passage leading&#xD;
'to the opposite quarter of the house. The passage, at a certain&#xD;
point, divided, one arm conducting to the apartment of Don Bal-&#xD;
thazar, the other to guest-chambers; opposite to these was a saloon&#xD;
which was usually employed in the colder seasons of the year.&#xD;
The "stairway, terminating the passage, led below to servants'&#xD;
apartments, l~itehen, and store-rooms, and constituted, in particu-&#xD;
lar, the province over which Anita presided. Hither were the&#xD;
footsteps of Olivia directed; but when she reached the place&#xD;
where the passage divided-.-her own lamp being shaded-she&#xD;
caught a glimpse of a light streaming from beneath the door of&#xD;
her uncle's chamber. Up to this moment the house had been&#xD;
apparently wrapt m sileiice.; now she fancied she heard voices&#xD;

resumed her lamp, and proceeded by the little flight which con.&#xD;
ducted below, to the apartments in the re r, which were assigned&#xD;
especially to Anita. These were easily a cessible; Anita never&#xD;
sixspecting any visitor, and least of all the ne in question, during&#xD;
her absence. Here, the poor girl, after curiously surveying the&#xD;
region into which she had not before often penetrated, began her&#xD;
search after food. She reasonably suppo ed that any provisions&#xD;
which she should find in these precincts ould be found undrug.&#xD;
ged. There was a basket. of cakes, su as had never been&#xD;
brought to her; of these she gathered a small number, taking&#xD;
care so to select them as not to disturb the general appearance&#xD;
of the pile. She found some "cold baked meats," also-some&#xD;
fragments of a bird-pie, and other matters of the same sort, such&#xD;
as had not been displayed among the cates usually provided for&#xD;
her. Anita, it was apparent, was by no means regardless of her&#xD;
own appetites. She had a taste for nice things, and, like most&#xD;
persons. of inferior race, was in the possession of an enormous&#xD;
appetite. Olivia fed freely while storing her spoils away in a lit-&#xD;
tie basket which she had appropriated from a collection in the&#xD;
closet of the crone. With the basket in one hand and her little&#xD;
half-shaded lamp in the other, she prepared to effect her return to&#xD;
her own chaiiaber; but hardly had she emerged from the old&#xD;
woman's apartments, when she heard the shuffling of feet upon&#xD;
the stair-ifight, while a suppressed cough attested the approach&#xD;
of the very person upon whose domain she had been trespassing.&#xD;
Here was a dilemma. To say that she had any fears, in the&#xD;
event of discovery, would be absurd. The domain was hers.&#xD;
The food which she had seemed to pilfi~r was, in fact, the proceeds&#xD;
of her own estates. But the action would have betrayed her se-&#xD;
cret suspicions, which. it was her policy for the present to conceal,&#xD;
and would only prQmpt her enemies to resort to new schemes&#xD;
which it might not be possible for her to detect and overthrow.&#xD;
With thebitter feelings of her soul duly increased with the necessity&#xD;
whichshenowfeltof concealment under these circumstances, Olivia&#xD;
silently receded along the path she had come. Stillthe shuffling of the&#xD;
old woman's feet was heard, the cough hioreased in. frequency&#xD;

Olivia, all the while, cowering and crouching like a guilty person,&#xD;
dreading to be discovered and haled into the light. But she es-&#xD;
caped; the crone receded to other parts ~f the room, having, it&#xD;
would seem, a variety of domestic care~, separate from those&#xD;
which concerned the young lady and the iI~on, her uncle. Mean-&#xD;
while, the damsel watched all her proceeding~ with no small in-&#xD;
terest. With careful finger, she made for herself an aperture be-&#xD;
tween the massed garments* upon the horse, through which she&#xD;
could behold all that took place within th~ chamber. And it was&#xD;
with momently increasing-interest that s e saw what numerous&#xD;
cares occupied the soul of that old wom n, momently hovering&#xD;
over the very verge of existence. How she had accumulated;&#xD;
with what method she examined and arra ged; with what caution&#xD;
she put away; with what heed she cou ted and reviewed her&#xD;
treasures, as if she was required to provi e for a thousand years.&#xD;
Olivia was confounded at the extent and s rt of possessions which&#xD;
the aged crone could show; the constant s oliations of a long life.&#xD;
There were chests and boxes, all of whi h she opened and ex-&#xD;
amined, lifting to the light, and surveying some- of the contents,&#xD;
with the same gratification, no doubt, whi h she felt when she had&#xD;
first pulled them from the no!Ae lord or Ia y whom she served, her&#xD;
master or their guests. Olivia beheld li tle trinkets there lifted&#xD;
up to sight, which she herself might laim. She recognized&#xD;
others, which had been the property of f iends. These were all&#xD;
conimonly associated with treasures of uite another character.&#xD;
Among the possessions of Anita there was uite an armory. There&#xD;
were hauberk, and helm, and lance-head, and dagger, an silver&#xD;
spur, and brass, and gorget,. and coat-of- ail, and escanpi of cot-&#xD;
ton, and bright targe of polished steel. But we forbear he cat-&#xD;

&#xD;
No doubt her conscience was quite satisfied with the Deity wi&#xD;
made her toils no weightier.&#xD;
The soul of Olivi~ was in great agitation. Fettered in a&#xD;
strained position, anxiously dreading and expecting discovery,&#xD;
cited by what she had seen, and moved by 4 purpose which'&#xD;
had not yet declared to herself, and which was still working&#xD;
her thought, she was yet compelled to ~emain quiet&#xD;
the old woman slept. Now, age does not seep easily, or&#xD;
soundly: and it was a long time still, before Olivia coul&#xD;
sure of~ the proof which taught her that Aa~ta could no lo&#xD;
hear and see. At length, persuaded that she might venture&#xD;
with safety, she did so. The light in the apartment guided&#xD;
movements. She approached the bed, and surveyed the sle&#xD;
with curiosity. The.~withered features, though composed&#xD;
calm of sleep, still seemed to wear, in the eyc~s of the damsel&#xD;
expression of that malignant hatred with which she felt&#xD;
that Anita had always regarded her. She, herself; looked&#xD;
the sleeper with features of indignant loathing. She turned a&#xD;
quickly. and proceeded to the table. The vague sugge&#xD;
which had been working in her mind had grown into a re&#xD;
tion.. She seized the phial, whose mysterious powers she&#xD;
lived herself to have felt, and without hesitation poured a&#xD;
lion of its contents into the wine-flask. There were still se&#xD;
draughts of the liquor in it; she knew the old woman's app&#xD;
for the juices of the grape, and pleased herself with the idea&#xD;
she would drink, and sleep ;-~--such ~ sleep as had been so&#xD;
imposed upon her own senses; and to such cruel results. In&#xD;
sleep of twenty~four hours-for such was the term which 0&#xD;
assigned to the action of the potion-she, herself; would enj&#xD;

then explore the household, and provide herself-so mod:&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
"Oh, detti!... Oh, sguardi!.. * A gran pena repiglie&#xD;

Forse ii mio amori'.. . Ma, no I Bacchiuso stammi&#xD;
Nel pin addentro del core."-Aunxiu.-Fiuppo.&#xD;
THUS dreaming, the sleep of Olivia de Alvaro was fortunal&#xD;
a protracted one. Nature, thus, asserts for herself some haj&#xD;
hours, even in a 'life which is one of unfailing sorrows. She si&#xD;
late. In the meantime, the girl J'uana had been se I time:&#xD;
her chamber. Her movements finally awakened the sleeper, ~&#xD;
found that the day had considerably advanced. The morning&#xD;
past was already awaiting her. She arose, and her toilet was&#xD;
sister by the girl in waiting. This performed, Olivia dismiss&#xD;
her, preferring to take her breakfast alone. A portion of&#xD;
she hurriedly put from sight, to, be thrown away, or other&#xD;
disposed of, at a fitting opportunity. Meanwhile, she pacified&#xD;
appetite by a free use of the cates which she had appropriate&#xD;
from the 'stores of the old woman. A more buoyant feeling j&#xD;
failed in her bosom, the natural effect of the temporary secui&#xD;
which she felt. She had found a respit~-.--had gained time-.wh&#xD;
in the case of youth, is always felt to be a gain of importai&#xD;
At all events, she was for so many hours safe, so she thought, fr&#xD;
the dangers of that drugging influence which, for a long time,]&#xD;
been sapping her strength, and placing her completely at&#xD;
mer~y of those who had so terribly abused their advantages&#xD;
power. Juana reappeared, removed the breakfast things,&#xD;
proceeded to her household duties. Olivia, all this while,&#xD;
nothing of her uncle; and finally ascertained that he had left-&#xD;
dwelling at an early hour for the city. Her hope was, that&#xD;
was usually the case, she would see n.o more of him during&#xD;

Le free from his presence was now always a source of&#xD;
~r. Whether she thought more favorably of the pres~.&#xD;
other we may conjecture only; but we may mention&#xD;
ds noon she proceeded to make her toilet anew, and&#xD;
with some regard to visitors. Her dress was carefully&#xD;
A as carefully adjusted. She wore a rich necklace of&#xD;
4 a bandeau of pearls encircled her forehead, twined&#xD;
Lu with the dark tresses of her glossy hair. She was,&#xD;
her grief, as the Greek poet describes Electra in her&#xD;
who dipt only the "extremity of her locks," "heedful&#xD;
th~ same woman still 1" Alas, Olivia de Alvaro was&#xD;
I only,-scarcely more than seventeen. Grief and a&#xD;
pressing sense of shame, had done much towards ma..&#xD;
passions. But she had enjoyed too little communion&#xD;
"orid to have done much towards ma ing her intel-&#xD;
felt 'shame and sorrow, but she felt ove also; and&#xD;
as still strong within her; and hope as not wholly&#xD;
Lthin her heart. Yet, even while she h ited her per-&#xD;
4th an eye to charm, she was trouble with misgiv..&#xD;
~s, more than once, caused her to dro p and sadden,&#xD;
sink down upon her couch, and give w y to a full flood&#xD;
~. What right had she to hope; what hope to be hap-&#xD;
resume to dream of the precious affections of another,&#xD;
;e could be given with the presumption only 'that she&#xD;
deserving of them all! The very truthiUness of her&#xD;
n 'prompted this just consideration of what was due to&#xD;
)ns of another. But youth and girlhood, and her own&#xD;
tally triumphed. She rose amidst her tears. She corn-&#xD;
'toilet. She arranged her tresses, and arrayed her jew..&#xD;
quest. Why should she not love, and loving, why not&#xD;
Vas not her love sufficiently warm,---her soul sufficiently&#xD;
-to render Philip de Vasconselos happy? She ha~, it&#xD;
secret, which it would be fatal to her hope were he to&#xD;
it how should' he ever know ?-And, "0! Blessed Vir-&#xD;
sxclaimed, looking up at the benign mother, "am I to&#xD;

&#xD;
It was not difficult, though the subject of a long, secret st&#xD;
gle in her own soul, to reconcile herself to a conviction ~w&#xD;
promised her the happiness which she desired. Her pa~&#xD;
proved too strong for her conscientiousness, an~ her rea&#xD;
readily gave themselves, as they but too comm4ily do, to&#xD;
requisitions of the former. Her philosophy is probably tha&#xD;
thousands in like situations. The fond heart of woman is&#xD;
niuch dependent for its life on the affections, not to be e~&#xD;
persuaded by an argument which sustains the cause of the la&#xD;
The love which Olivia felt for Philip de Vasconselos was&#xD;
precious to her soul to yield in such a struggle; and the re&#xD;
was, that she determined, though with shuddering and tremb]&#xD;
should he offer her his hand, to subdue her fears, her sens&#xD;
justice, all scruples of whatever sort, and accept the bles&#xD;
which her heart craved as its very breath of life. What c&#xD;
her uncle do'? What could he dare? The word from his&#xD;
that would blast her, would seal his own ruin and disgrace&#xD;
ever! She Would be true to Philip, as true as woman ever&#xD;
;    was to man ;-he would protect her from all abuse and outi&#xD;
-would rescue her from the hostile power from which she&#xD;
most reason to fear both; and in the pure devotion of the fut&#xD;
might she not hope to repair the misfortunes of the past in wi&#xD;
she could conscientiously affirm, that, however much she inL&#xD;
have been the victim of the guilty, she had never been within&#xD;
the participatory in his crime?&#xD;
Soothed, if not wholly satisfied, assured in some degree, by&#xD;
solacing sort of argument through which her mind had past, 01&#xD;
proceeded to the latticed verandah, and from thence descent&#xD;
into the shrubbery. Aid the innocent flower! ah! the un'&#xD;
scious bloom, iind the unsuspected blossom! How they appea&#xD;
to her.! and whispered-such whispers as made her turn av&#xD;
from them with averted head, while upon her pale cheek tl~&#xD;
might have been seen a flush as deep and vivid as a warm&#xD;
set in a humid sky. She returned to the verandah, closing&#xD;
lattices, letting down its curtains, and shutting out the shari&#xD;
glances of' the day. Then she threw herself upoii the settee&#xD;

in a sorrowful meditation. Leaving her thus abstracted for&#xD;
awhile, 14 us proceed to other parties.&#xD;
That n~orning, Philip de Vasconselos had eaten his humble&#xD;
meal alo~e, and in silence. Andres was~ absent ~ whither he&#xD;
knew not, and the younger brother was of a temper, and just&#xD;
now in su~h a m od, that it was only a safe policy ~in the elder,&#xD;
not to seem to curious in any of his affairs. Philip, though&#xD;
naturally and inanely troubled about the fate of Andres,&#xD;
sympathizing w th him very sincerely in his disappointments,&#xD;
was yet t0o human to be deeply grieved by the one misfortune&#xD;
-over al1---whi h his brother felt, in the denial of his mistress.&#xD;
It would not, in eed, have been quite in nature, not to have felt&#xD;
his own h~pes r vive pleasurably at the knowledge. He was&#xD;
conscious of a exulting feeling in his bosom; accordingly;&#xD;
which, knowing ~ts source, he labored, though unsuccessfully, to&#xD;
school an4 to re uke. But this labor did not prevent him from&#xD;
making hi~ toilet that morning with extreme care, and resolving&#xD;
to visit th~ fair Olivia. In this purpose he was seconded by the&#xD;
counsels o~' the ~ay gallant Nuno de Tobar, who suddenly broke&#xD;
in upon hi~n, and finding him alone, gave free vent t~ his encour-&#xD;
agements. Somehow, he too had heard of the defeat of Andres,&#xD;
and he urged it as one of the sigus in favor of his friend. But&#xD;
Philip shook hi head gravely. He valued the Lady Olivia too&#xD;
highly to i'ancy that she would be easy of attairrment. His pas-&#xD;
sion ~was too ea nest, not to prompt him to a very severe ques-&#xD;
tioning of his wn merits, and to this effect was his reply to&#xD;
Tobar. But th latter loudly denounced his excessive modesty,&#xD;
and urged a th usand proofs, each conclusive to his own audacious&#xD;
spirit, for the encouragement of his friend. In the end, they&#xD;
proceeded together to the dwelling of the lady.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, her uncle had suddenly made his appear-&#xD;
ance, bringing with him another visitor. This was a gaily dress-&#xD;
ed cavalier, suff~ciently comely of person, and smooth of face,,&#xD;
to be satisfied w~th himself; but who possessed few distinguish..&#xD;
ing traits by wl1dch to compel attention or r~spect. Still, if&#xD;

Olivia was to wed with any body, this was the person whom&#xD;
uncle was most pleased to tolerate. He may have had sp&#xD;
reasons for this preference. Such, at least, was the belie&#xD;
Olivia, to whom Don Balthazar had more than once spoke&#xD;
the subject. He himself frequently afforded to the young&#xD;
lant the means of being with his niece in private. Don Au&#xD;
tin de Sinolar was one of the passable gentlemen that go to n&#xD;
up what is called good society. He came of respectable fan&#xD;
enjoyed respectable possessions, obeyed the usual laws of fasi&#xD;
and never trespassed upon th&amp;amp; proprieties of the~ circle. He&#xD;
confident of speech, and was always in possession of the IL&#xD;
intelligence which could please the persons present by diE&#xD;
aging the absent. He was no less devotedly the lover of 0&#xD;
than ,were the brothers Yasconselos-that is, so far as conce:&#xD;
the externals of devotion. But the essentials of an earnest&#xD;
sion, of any sort, were not within the nature of De Sin&#xD;
He' was of marriageable years and person, and an establish&#xD;
was necessary to his position, a wife was necessary to hiE&#xD;
establishment, and he required rank as a first condition in the&#xD;
sel he should espouse. Other requisites were wholly subordb&#xD;
The ordinary secret of this ordinary gentleman, who, even ii&#xD;
workings of his passions, obeys rigidly a conventional arr~&#xD;
ment, was that which made his policy ; and to do the agreeab&#xD;
his mistress, as a carpet knight, was the extent of his perf&#xD;
ance in the effort to secure fav~~r. Had Olivia been of a&#xD;
temper, De Sinolar would have proved a formidable nw&#xD;
either of the Portuguese brothers. The small graces of soc&#xD;
the tea-table heroics, were in the possession of neither. P&#xD;
de Vasconselos was particularly deficient in such arts. He&#xD;
of a grave, calm, reserved nature, too earnestly in by&#xD;
meditate his conquests by any ordinary means. He~ could&#xD;
show, as he did without his own consciousness, perhaps, how&#xD;
cious in his eyes was the object of his passion. The womo&#xD;
1&amp;amp;eart soon distinguishes between two such suitors, and if she d&#xD;
mines in favor of either, does not hesitate long in declanin~&#xD;
him whose earnestness is congenial with her own. It is the wo:&#xD;

of hi~ friend had failed as yet to prompt him so soon&#xD;

and spoke to her in those subdued tones which are so&#xD;

among the savages ?"&#xD;
"Unless," answered Tobar, with a laugh, "he might b&#xD;
fortune by a conquest among the saints ;"-and he looked&#xD;
chievously a1~ Olivia as he spoke.&#xD;
De Sinolar was for a moment at fault.&#xD;
"Among the saints !-I don't see. Oh! yes! among&#xD;
ladies! Saints and angels! yes! well, that were certainly&#xD;
dangerous warfare, and one that I much prefer myself. If&#xD;
is the game of Don Philip, he is wiser, I am free to confess,&#xD;
most soldiers of my knowing. They have, methinks, pre&#xD;
small value of ladies' favors ; and show but little wisdom&#xD;
cordingly. I beg you ten thousand pardons, Sei~or Don P]&#xD;
but I am bold to say I have regarded you as too much of&#xD;
warrior to give heed to beauty-too fond of the tilt and s~&#xD;
to hold in overmuch estimation the darts from lady's eyes,&#xD;
the wounds they give ;-wounds, I say it from my soul's experi4&#xD;
such as no army surgeon can be found to heal I"&#xD;
Here he smote his bosom afThctedly, and looked to OIL&#xD;
but her eyes were upon the floor. Even the sigh of the gal&#xD;
which followed his speech, was lost upon her heedless se~&#xD;
They were all alive, however, the next moment, as the&#xD;
tones of Vasconselos answered De Sinolar.&#xD;
"You do me wrong, Don Augustin, and you do the char~&#xD;

He pause. Oliyia, looking down the.while, said in low tones-~&#xD;
"But, Sei~ior, yoYt have not yet answered to the doubts of Don&#xD;
Augustin, tc~uching your departure with the expedition."&#xD;
"Ah! tr$ie," q~1Qth De Sinolar-" They say that there are&#xD;
doubts, yet Was it my thought that Don Hernan had shown you&#xD;
the better argue t."&#xD;
"* They say righ ly, Sefiorita," replied Vasconselos to Olivia,&#xD;
and scarcely notice g Do Sinolar-" who say that I have yet de-&#xD;
termined nothing. I am truly but half resolved to depart, yet&#xD;
fully half incline to remain. There be private reasons for&#xD;
this uncertainty. whether Don Hernan will succeed in per-&#xD;
suading me-and ~t is one of my doubts if he desires ~so to do&#xD;
-will greatly rest upon the force of other and opposite persua-&#xD;
sions than those o war. Perhaps, it were only wise with me,&#xD;
to yield blindly to Don ilernan's arguments, and look nothing&#xD;
farther."&#xD;
It was the tone ith which this last sentence was spoken, and&#xD;
the look which accompanied, which held the meaning more sig-&#xD;
nificantly than the ~vords themselves. The sweet, sad resigna-&#xD;
tion in both went 4irect to the heart of Olivia. But she cast&#xD;
her eyes upon the ~Ioor and remained silent. But De Sinolar,&#xD;
who was conscious of nothing but the words spoken, and who was&#xD;
no adept in looking below the surface of any thing, proceeded in&#xD;
his usual manner.&#xD;
"Well, Seflor, it will be needful that you should decide short-&#xD;
ly. In a few days ~we shall have the tournament, and inafew&#xD;
more, the caravels ~ivill be all ready to receive the armament.&#xD;
Then will you embark the horses and artillery. These the first.&#xD;
Then will the foot soldiers go on board, and at the last the&#xD;
knights and gentlemen. They are baking famous quantities of&#xD;
bread, even now, a~ Roja's, and la Granja's. The adelantado is&#xD;
eager to be at worl~ among the heather savages, stripping the&#xD;
gold from the altar~ and the treasure fro the rich cities of the&#xD;
Apalachian. Ah! ~ady Olivia, when th se things are going on,&#xD;

we shall be as ~luil and quiet here as if we had never&#xD;
either dance or music.&#xD;
"These gay knights will all be on the path of con uest.&#xD;
For my part, I say let them conquer! I have no passion&#xD;
quest, and I have no faith in its fruits. I believe them t&#xD;
delusions. One man gets off with a sound head an a full&#xD;

"Bug the fame, Seffor-the glory'?" said Olrvi&#xD;

And here he looked with a sudden tenderness awards&#xD;

"Your huma~iity is commendable, Sefior," was the somewhat&#xD;
cold response of Vasconselos, who, indeed, had scarcely heeded&#xD;
what the other ~ad been saying; and now turned from him with a&#xD;
contempt which was sufficiently apparent. But the other was by&#xD;
no means discomfited by an expression which he clearly beheld.&#xD;
He replied very~ promptly and very indifferently, as if' his social&#xD;
position-his w~alth-put him quite beyond reproach.&#xD;
"Ah! you scarcely mean that, I know, Sei~or Don Philip:&#xD;
but it matters nothing. I don't care who knows that I am re-&#xD;
solved to live while I can, and risk no bones upon reputation.&#xD;
If heads are to be cloven, let them take the. hardest: if brains&#xD;
are to be scattered, it needs only that you choose such a&amp;amp;can waste&#xD;
little: if hard blows are to be struck, get those men only for&#xD;
the work who have been trained to the boucan. If you love&#xD;
fighting, Don P~iilip, it is well for you: not for me. I love it&#xD;
not. You have tried your hand at it, and it suits you. You&#xD;
have fought against the Moors. You have already had a taste&#xD;
of Floridian fig~iting, and I have seen you carry yourself; even&#xD;
sportively, against Bartolomeo de Gallegos, and Sei~or, Nuno,&#xD;
here, and I am f~ee to confess that you are the last person whom&#xD;
I should entreat to a supper of blades and lances. I am only at&#xD;
conflict with gentle woman," smiling sweetly on Olivia ;-" and&#xD;
leave the pagan to such brave knights as yourself. By the way,&#xD;
Senior Don Philip, they tell me you served with Francis Pizarro&#xD;
in Peru! I ha forgotten that."&#xD;
"It mattered ot," answered Vasconselos coldly.&#xD;
"Now there is a man for you, that Francis Pizarro. He's&#xD;
the rough cust mer for a weak stomach. He's what I call a&#xD;
hero! Talk of Oortez, indeed! How should Hernan Cortez&#xD;
be a hero'? I'v seen him a hundred times when he was nothing&#xD;
but a farmer, a~ had a hacienda not half the value of' my own.&#xD;
lie was lucky, ~efior-very lucky. I remember him well. I&#xD;
was but a boy when he worked his farm and drove his mule,&#xD;

Vasconselos, on the contrary, gave him little heed, and se&#xD;
not to think it necessary to gainsay his opinions. He wa&#xD;
tent that he should "rabble on;" ~as it afforded him an op&#xD;
nity to murmur a quiet remark, in under tones, to is fair&#xD;
panion, whose responses, brief and tim~d, were always deli&#xD;
in like subdued accents. It was only when his st~ck of&#xD;
talk was entirely exhausted that Don Augustin was contel&#xD;
take his departure. This he did, when, at the clo~e of a&#xD;
ramblir~g speech, he had emptied his budget of ac~mulat~&#xD;
what he said being only a repetition of what he ha Jheard.&#xD;
did not seem to apprehend any danger from leaving the 11e~&#xD;

ended on the ease of the dialogue and the liveliness f the hu&#xD;

"And wherefore not, Sefior?"&#xD;
"You take little delight, I fear, in such exercises as challenge&#xD;
the best regarc~s of knighthood. I have seen you at very few&#xD;
of the gentle passages between the knights."&#xD;
"True; but I am not insensible. I have heard full reports&#xD;
of their performances, and found delight in the accounts of such&#xD;
grace and valor, and courtesy and skill, as has been rarely seen."&#xD;
"Yet would I have beheld you, Seiiorita, among the gay beau-&#xD;
ties of this island court, who have stimulated courtesy by their&#xD;
grace, and pro~npted achievement to great things by their ap..&#xD;
proving smiles. I have looked for you, Sefiorita, very often,&#xD;
and,-.---may I say it,-hav"e sometimes left the field, as, seeing&#xD;
you not, it has seemed to me to lack its best attraction."&#xD;
"Ah! Seflor, it is the wont of Cavaliers to use this sort of&#xD;
speech to foolish damsels. And why should you leave a field,&#xD;
where there have been so many beauties to cheer, and so many&#xD;
sweet voices to encourage ?"&#xD;
"Yet was there one, of all,-one only, lady, whom I most&#xD;
desired to behold."&#xD;
"AhI and why should the Seilor Philip be insensible to the&#xD;
praises which have daily hailed his passages on every hand?&#xD;
Who has wontheapplauses and the prizes at the several tourneys?&#xD;
Whose lance path been most honored in the conflict ?-whose&#xD;
name been most sounded ?-in whose fame have the multitude&#xD;

" Alas! lady, all these tributes are of little value in the ears&#xD;
of Philip de Vasconselos, compared with the sweeter assurances&#xD;
thatmight fall from the lipsof one, the loveliestvirgin of all Cuba 1"&#xD;
The eyes of Vasconselos were fastened tenderly, as he spoke,&#xD;
upon those of Olivia. Hers sunk, bashfully, beneath his glance;&#xD;
and a warm re~1 flush quickly overspread her cheeks. Her hand lay&#xD;
beside him updn the sofa, which she partly occupied. His fingers&#xD;
fell hesitatingly upon it; and it was not withdrawn. She was&#xD;

~lehtly to surprise the leader. He looked inquir4gly int4&#xD;

In faith, you do; and I must sing to you a merry song ere I grow&#xD;

She would have risen, and motioned to the guitar lying upon a&#xD;
table; but he held her firmly by the hand. He was bewildered&#xD;
by her cond~itct, but grew more and. more firm as he coritempla..&#xD;
ted her. Tie had s&amp;amp;en too much of the world, and of human&#xD;
nature, not to perceive that there was some mystery in the pro..&#xD;
feeding. How else should he account for the feverish hurry of&#xD;
her manner, at such a moment, so utterly unlike her conduct,&#xD;
during all other periods ?-how, for that sobbing sigh, that con-&#xD;
vulsive shuiider, and those forceckhusky accents while delivering&#xD;
words ostensibly meant to be playful and sportive? Vasconselos&#xD;
was now no~ to be deceived. He saw that~ the gaiety was all&#xD;
assumed on~y ;-yet wherefore? He was more ready to believe&#xD;
that there w~s agony, rather than merriment, in her spirit at that&#xD;
moment.  ~I'hen why should she seek to sport with emotions, so&#xD;
sacred, in his bosom, when she had always before shown him a&#xD;
respect approaching to reverence? Vasconselos felt instinctively&#xD;
that the damsel sought under the guise of levity only to conceal&#xD;
the activity ~nd presence of deep and painful emotions. He felt&#xD;
and sa'~ all this; but it was not the moment, nor was his the&#xD;
mood, hav g advanced thus far, to be diverted from his object.&#xD;
He still kept his grasp upon her hand. He looked steadily into&#xD;
her eyes. They answered his gaze wildly. She trembled all&#xD;
over. He ~poke.&#xD;
"Olivi~lady-I cannot n~w be baffled-I must speak, and&#xD;
you must answer me. It is too~great a matter, to rAe-too&#xD;
vital to my soul's life, to suffer me to be silent longer, or to&#xD;
ieave you ' without having an answer. Yet you must not suspect&#xD;
me of unkindness. I see that you suffer. I am not deceived by&#xD;
this show of merriment. I feel that there is a secret sorrow which&#xD;
you vainly struggle to conceal-'--"&#xD;
"No! no! no secret-I-O! Seflor, release me-let me go !"&#xD;
And she burst into a passion of tears, and 1~uried her face in&#xD;
her hands upon the arm of the settee. Vasconselos bent over,&#xD;

her lover, and followed her uncle from the room. Scgrcely li&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
"Mark me well:&#xD;
I boldly tell thee that I bear a soul,&#xD;
Prepared for either fortune. If thy hand&#xD;
Be stronger, use thy power." GA~[5MKO~&#xD;
DoN BALTHAZAR found no difficulty in sending o the tw'J&#xD;
ors. After the departure of Olivia, they had but little 11&#xD;
to remain. Her uncle was not much a favorite wi h them&#xD;
was known to be a hard and selfish man, who was believe~&#xD;
rightly, to.have no sympathies with either. Still, e Was&#xD;
of the court, and could put on, when he pleased, t e mann&#xD;
a prei.~x c1~eva1ier. He was now exceedingly cour eous ani&#xD;
diiatory, and apologized warmly for the unavoidab e witlid&#xD;
of Jii~ niece, and for those cares, of his own, whic denie(&#xD;
the pleasure of giving them further entertainme t. H~&#xD;
them, without scruple, the cause of the present co fusion&#xD;
household; and made quite a pretty story of it.&#xD;
"His venerable housekeeper, who had been al ost a&#xD;
to Olivia, watching and tending her youth with m re than&#xD;
tal solicitude, was suddenly found dead in her sea. Wei&#xD;
morning, to all appearance, at noon she had passed to judg&#xD;
and this without alarming the family. Olivia w s, of c&#xD;
terribly shocked by the event. She had retired console&#xD;
her chamber. She was so tenderly attached to A ita, and&#xD;
so tenderly attached to her! Her affection was very gr&#xD;
great indeed ;-so great, that he, Don Balthazar d Alvar&#xD;
exceedingly anxious for her health ;-and so forth" "A&#xD;
good morning to you, Sefiores."&#xD;

11.P&#xD;
&#xD;
the ugliest and most fiendish-looking human vultures you ever&#xD;
beheld. As for tier attachment to Olivia, or Olivia's to her, I don't&#xD;
believe a word of it. I never saw any proofs of it myself; and&#xD;
have heard mar~y things which lead me to think there could be&#xD;
no attachment between them. In fact, Leonora tells me that&#xD;
Anita was no wore than a spy upon the poor girl, whose steps&#xD;
were watched a carefully as if every bush concealed a lover,&#xD;
and behind evei~y tree stood an armed n-ian ready to snatch her&#xD;
up and make off with her. Be sure, Don Balthazar has no de-&#xD;
sire that she should pass from any keeping but his own. He&#xD;
enjoys too mucil good picking from the estates of Olivia to give&#xD;
her up without a struggle. There is a strange story about a&#xD;
silver mine whi~h he has somehow wholly appropriated to him-&#xD;
self.; and by all accounts, he may well dread the day of reckon-&#xD;
ing with the ma~ who shall become her husband. For this re -&#xD;
son he keeps he~ immured as much as possible; and ftis certa&#xD;
that no gentlem~tn can obtain access to his dwelling without fin -.&#xD;
ing himself watched. You must continue, Philip, your visi s&#xD;
when the uncle is knoWn to be busy elsewhere. There is som&#xD;
thing gained, I ~am thinking, by the death of this old woma&#xD;
It is a special p~o~idence in your behalf. See that you ma e&#xD;
use of it."&#xD;
The calculations of Nuno de Tobar, in respect to the adva -&#xD;
tages gained in favor of the larger liberty of Olivia by the dea h&#xD;
of Anita, were somewhat those of Olivia herself; for, in spi e&#xD;
of the shock which she had received by that event, and the n t..&#xD;
ural horrors which were taught her by her own secret conscious -&#xD;
ness of the cause of it, she could not avoid reflecting upon t e&#xD;
probable increase of her own securities in consequence. Th~y&#xD;
were both deceived. That very night, the place of Anita wt~s&#xD;
filled by another old woman, another creature of Don Balthaza~',&#xD;
not so ugly, perhaps, or so old as her predecessor, but equally&#xD;
hard fiwored and unscrupulous. Sylvia was a mestizo a14,&#xD;
brought from one Qf the haciendas of the estate, a few miles~n&#xD;
the country. Olivia had seen and known her before. The sigl4&#xD;
of this woman, in her new situation, left her little hope of pro~~&#xD;

&#xD;
by the death of Anita6 Sylvia was as subtle as t~te form r~ and&#xD;
no less the willing tool of her employer. She ha4 all th fierce&#xD;
malignity of mood characteristic of the hybrid race t'~ hich&#xD;
she belonged,-a people usually of fierce passiorts, sudd n im-&#xD;
pulses, capricious impulse, and tenacious, of the s~nse of ong&#xD;
and injury to the latest moment of existence. I~on Ba lazar&#xD;
knew his creatures well, and satisfied of ~his fact, ~Olivia, the&#xD;
moment, resigned herself to despair agah~i.&#xD;
But she found an unexpected ally, where she l~ast loo e~l for&#xD;
one, in the person of the young serving girl, Ju4ia. s girl&#xD;
was the grand-daughter of Anita. The event whi~h put a ~ther&#xD;
in the place of her grandmother, had also its injurious c&amp;amp;nse-&#xD;
quences to herself: She naturally regarded l~erself s the&#xD;
heiress of her kinswoman; and knowing how large and various&#xD;
had been the accumulations of the latter, her expectation were&#xD;
correspondingly large. To her consternation, th~ succe or to&#xD;
the place of Anita at once usurped possession of all her tores.&#xD;
Juana was driven out from the precincts altogether, an com-&#xD;
pelled to confine herself to the little chamber whicii she h d long&#xD;
occupied, adjoining that of Olivia. Sylvia had assumed he en-&#xD;
tire control of the household, and her u~urpations, in a few h urs,&#xD;
were such as to satisfy Juana that her expectations fr the&#xD;
savings of her grandmother were all cut off. She was ld in&#xD;
no more favor than her mistress, and soon found herself nder&#xD;
an authority which was disposed to submit to no ques o ing.&#xD;
Sylvia had her own children and grand-children to prov' for.&#xD;
Juana was dreadfully indignant. She did not dare to a oach&#xD;
Don Balthazar with her griefs; but she condescended to nfide&#xD;
to Olivia. In her passion she revealed to her all the se ts of&#xD;
their mutual prison-house, all at least that she knew, an thus,&#xD;
in a measure, confirmed the unhappy girl in the conviction hich&#xD;
she had already been compelled to feel that she was the v etim&#xD;
of a thousand cruel arts. Juana swore to have her re e ges,&#xD;
and better to secure sympathy, she promised 6livia t a she&#xD;
should have redress also. What were her plans of ye ance&#xD;
she did not declare; but when questioned in respect t her&#xD;
&#xD;
OLIVIA'S ALLY.                  117&#xD;
means and opportunities, contented herself with a knowing loo&#xD;
and 'a sagacious shaking of the head. She was naturally a st~&#xD;
pid wench, but possessed that sort of animal cunning which is so&#xD;
frequently found in connection with a base and feeble intellect.&#xD;
For the present nothing could be extracted from her, and th&#xD;
business of the household went on without disorder, and wit&#xD;
no apparent interruption; But, as we shall see in the seque,&#xD;
Juana was busy after a fashion of her own.&#xD;
But the day, thus distinguished by the startling events whic&#xD;
we have recorded, was not at an end. Olivia sat alone in th&#xD;
verandah. The evening meal had been set before her by Juan&#xD;
but had been carried out untasted. She had no appetite jus&#xD;
then for mortal food. Her soul wa~ still agitated to its depths&#xD;
as the sea that heaves up tumultuously with all its waves, thoug&#xD;
the winds which have swept it with fearful strife, have wholl&#xD;
passed and gone. She lay reclined upon the settee of wicker&#xD;
work where we 'beheld her during her morning interview wit&#xD;
Vasconselos. There was no light in the apartment; none,&#xD;
fact, was necessary, while the moon glinting through groves .o&#xD;
orange and. anana, sufficed for the desires of the sad and contempt&#xD;
tive spirit. The gay gleams flitted over the floor of the veran&#xD;
dah, and glided, stealthily and faintly, to the interior of th&#xD;
apartment, otherwise dimly shaded by the massive foliage whic&#xD;
curtained the opening in front. Here, saddening under th&#xD;
sad sweetness of the scene, Olivia brooded,-.absorbed in ru-&#xD;
minating the events and the prospects of a life, which, at its very&#xD;
budding, seemed already shrouded with a blight. 'Her heart'&#xD;
sunk within her as she~ thought; all was dark in the future; all&#xD;
gloomy, grievous, and reproachful in the past. At length she&#xD;
wept, and found a momentary relief in her tears. The big drops&#xD;
forced their way through her fingers,-.tears of a bitterness&#xD;
which proved superior to all the sweets promised by an affection&#xD;
which was only too precious tc~ her hopes.&#xD;
"He loves me !"' was her exclamation. "lie loves me-.he---.-&#xD;
the only man for whom this l~eart has ever felt a passion. I&#xD;
cannot mistake his silent admiration. I cannot doubt the broken&#xD;

and oh! were it but that I could bear his gla~ices wil&#xD;

She had spoken audibly this soliloquy. It ade its&#xD;
other ears, though her own were scarcely conscio s of its&#xD;
From the dense masses of shade at the foot o the ye&#xD;
came a voice in answer:&#xD;

enough, though it comports little with thy resolution. If th~&#xD;
wilt shake off the knights of Portugal, there is no need to sei&#xD;
me with them. Nay, for the very reason that they depai&#xD;
should I be suffered to remain. Let me say, Olivia, that I r&#xD;

do for thee to wed with Philip de Vasconselos."&#xD;
"And wherefore not ?"&#xD;
"Ah! there are sufficient reasons."&#xD;
"None which concern thee, at least. If I have so resolved,&#xD;
is for a reason of mine own, the force of which it is little likel&#xD;
that thou shouldst feel."&#xD;

thee before. Said I not then, that I scorn this man De Sinolar ~'~'&#xD;

It is my secret as well as thine, but I have every confidence that&#xD;
thou wilt keep it faithfully. Now, to have a secret, such as ~she&#xD;

not, or the fires which prey upon my soul like those of a vo]Aano.&#xD;
Better thou shouldst, without weapon or preparation, arous~ the&#xD;
she-wolf in the cavern with her young, than vex me farther ~vith&#xD;
thy taunts. Beware! I have been weak, and thou hast taken me&#xD;
at 'vantage. But if I am weak, I am blind no longer; and if not&#xD;
strong to bear, I am, at least, tempered to resist and to resent.&#xD;
The very passions thou hast goaded into existence will be my&#xD;
avengers in the end. I counsel thee give heed to what I say. Be-&#xD;
ware! I am capable of things even more evil than thou think'st&#xD;
for, and there is a limit beyond which it were well for thee not to&#xD;
go. Once more I warn thee. I have had such bitter thoughts&#xD;
and feelings towards thee, that didst thou press me much further,&#xD;
I feel as if I could slay thee with a dagger, even as I would strike&#xD;
the serpent that crept to my bosom while I slept."&#xD;
She had risen while she spoke, and stood before him, wild and&#xD;
passionate, with flashing dark eye, and white arm waving. lie&#xD;
surveyed her with a stern and frowning brow, but somewhat&#xD;
coldly-his lips compressed, as if with a feeling of pride and&#xD;
power,.-and his eye looking into hers with the bright fixedhess&#xD;
which that of the serpent is said to show when fascinating the&#xD;
bird from the tree.  I1'here was a pause; the parties still regar ing&#xD;
each other. She, standing, looking on him with a raised spirit, and&#xD;
wild, fiery glance; he, sitting, returning the gaze steadfastly -&#xD;
coolly if not calmly, and apparently reserving himself for the&#xD;
proper moment. At length, he spoke, very deliberately, a~ if&#xD;
measuring every syllable.&#xD;
"I think I do know thee, Olivia de Alvaro, and something&#xD;
know of what thou art capable in thy passion. Have I no, of&#xD;
late, likened thee to thy Biscayan mother? and her I knew t~ior-&#xD;
oughly. Let me convince thee that I do not estimate too l~um-&#xD;
bly thy powers of evil. Sit down once more while I question&#xD;
thee."&#xD;
There was something so calm and quiet in the authority of his&#xD;

and resumed her seat. Steadily looking into her face, h&#xD;
needed to speak again, as deliberately as before.&#xD;
"Didst thou know, Olivia, that the poor old woman,&#xD;
was poisoned'? She died from no old age, but from a&#xD;
liquor which she was made to drink."&#xD;
The listener grew white as death. Her knees shook b&#xD;
her. Her tongue was frozen.&#xD;
"Ay, Olivia, some loving hand drenched her posset witi&#xD;
bountiful allowance! Dost thou know this kerchief Oliv~&#xD;
He showed it. It was her own. She was silent.&#xD;
"This kerchief did I find where the person was conceal&#xD;
drugged the old woman's draught."&#xD;
He paused, as if awaiting the answer. But none was s&#xD;
"Thou hast nothing to say. Well! It is enough.&#xD;
speak is sufficiently to answer at such a moment . But&#xD;
say to thee farther, my child, it is known to me that thou 1&#xD;
wast the last in the ~chamber of Anita last night! Should&#xD;
think, now, that I am ignorant of what thou art capable?&#xD;
thy hand, Olivia de Alvaro, that drugged the old w&#xD;
draught with death."&#xD;
"And if it were, Don Baithazar de Alvaro," exclaimed&#xD;
rising, and resuming all her strength and courage, as she&#xD;
the air and listened to the tone of superiority which he e:&#xD;
ed-" and if it were my hand, then were my hand righi&#xD;

also justified in the sight of man and heaven. Go to, Seiic&#xD;

so pleased, to listen to thee as thou reporters all thy story&#xD;
world. I fear thee not-I know not now that I fear anyt&#xD;
life. Thou hast brought me to this desperation. Yet kno&#xD;
when I mixed the drug with the draught of Anita, I kne'~&#xD;

when that drug was mixed with h~r wine? I saw her, ay, and&#xD;
thee, as the fatal phial was held between ye to the light, and ye&#xD;
resolved together that my potion was to be increased. Wt~s it&#xD;
unreasonable if I thought the goodly medicine which ye designed&#xD;
for me, in your charity, it was but fitting that ye also should&#xD;
partake? I wished to commend ye also to such blessed visions&#xD;
and dreams, as ye nightly and daily prepared for me. I would&#xD;
have ye too enjoy that insensible response, which ye i:lecreed be-&#xD;
tween ye should lighten my cares, and keep me from the fee ing&#xD;
of my cruel wrongs; and had it been possible, Don Balthazar,&#xD;
that I could have mingled the drug with thy own wine-cup, this&#xD;
hand should fearlessly have done it ;-not, I affirm, as meaning&#xD;
that it should be fatal to thy life, but as forcing you to such t~ial&#xD;
of those sufferings of mine which have never yet compelled your&#xD;
pity and forbearance! Now, that you know of what I am c4a-&#xD;
ble, I again bid ye beware! You know th% terms between us.&#xD;
I loathe you, and I fear you; yet so little do I fear the worl4 of&#xD;
man, that, were it not for one who lives among ye, I should cbm-&#xD;

and all that Jam! Nay, the time may come, when, heedles~ of&#xD;
the shame which shall follow from this speech, I myself shah go&#xD;
out into the highways of the city, and speak aloud the truth&#xD;

D~n Balthazar was silenced. For the moment, he had no&#xD;
refug~e. He rose and left the verandah, and passed into the&#xD;

around it; while Olivia, thoroughly exhausted, but no longer&#xD;
tremulous or fearful, rose with a firm frame and spirit, and&#xD;
moved quietly to her chamber.&#xD;

A WARNING.&#xD;

CHAPTER~ x.&#xD;
"07/mi).  The time is troublesome:&#xD;
we'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy&#xD;
Does yet depend.'~&#xD;
PHILIP DR VASCONSELOS did not, as was anticipated by Donji&#xD;
thazar, and warmly counselled by Nuno d~ Tobar, return in~n&#xD;
diately to the attempt upon the affections of Olivia de Al~~&#xD;
It would have been quite enough to preclude his visit for thaV&#xD;
and the next, at least, that there had been a death in the fairli&#xD;
an event, however, to which his more reckless friend attached&#xD;
sort of importance. ~But/ there was another reason for dela~&#xD;
hesitation: Philip had i/o such confidence in his own posij3i&#xD;
no such faith in his own powers, no such conviction of the fatv&#xD;
able regards of the lads, as was asserted by Nuno. lie wa~,&#xD;
the contrary, troubled $vith many misgivings, which grew ml&#xD;
faculty the more he examined. The very fact that he really ~&#xD;
earnestly loved, made him tremble at. the thought of precipitt~t&#xD;
his fate; and the true lover is almost always prepared to di.&#xD;
humbly of his own claims, in view of that supposed perfection.wh&#xD;
he recognizes in the lady of his love. Besides, with the natu&#xD;
delicacy of a proud and' honorable mind, conscious 'of his o&#xD;
poverty, he felt the awkwardness of a suit to one who was in&#xD;
possession of' great riches. He felt how easy it was to susp&#xD;
the motives of such a suitor, and dreaded lest such a suspic~&#xD;
should taint the mind of the lady herself. Not that he was c&#xD;
posed to forego his suit because of this; or any other consid~&#xD;
tion. On the contrary, he was resolved to bring it to the tri&#xD;
and know the worst as soon as he could think it proper to do&#xD;
But all his conclusions counselled him to delay. Nor must&#xD;
allow it to be supposed that he was without his encouragement&#xD;

LOVER'S HOPES.                  1~7&#xD;
He persuaded himself that there was much in what had taken&#xD;
place between himself and Olivia in that last interview, to shpw&#xD;
that she was very far from insensible to his pretensions. Ii~ is&#xD;
true that there were things in her carriage-some curious caprices&#xD;
of mood and manner, which he found it not easy altogether&#xD;
to comprehend. But there was still enough to pleasee a lov-&#xD;
er; and to persuade one, even less bold and ardent than 2ur&#xD;
hero, to continue a pursuit in which he had certainly suffered no&#xD;
repulse. She had evaded his application, but she had showi~ia&#xD;
peculiar sensibility at his approach. She had trifled somewhat&#xD;
when he was seriously earnest, but what was the meaning of her&#xD;
tremors when her fair white hand lingered within his grasp? and&#xD;
had she not encouraged his return ?-and had she not declared an&#xD;
interest in his presence in Cuba, in language too impressive to be,.&#xD;
wholly without that desirable signification which the lover seeks?&#xD;
Vasconselos was very far from being discouraged-nay, without&#xD;
heeding the confident assurance of Nuno de Tobar, he felt a new&#xD;
hope springing within his bosom at every moment of increased&#xD;
reflection; and, ere the day was well over, he had resolved to&#xD;
bring his doubts to an issue, at least, before the departure of the&#xD;
expedition. It was his farther resolution, if successful in his&#xD;
suit, to abandon the adventure with De Soto. For that matter,&#xD;
he had partly determined thus, whatever might be the result of~is&#xD;
courtship. This conclusion was reached that very night, and&#xD;
the next morning, when he was visited by Tobar, he unhesitat-&#xD;
ingly declared it, to the great consternation of that young gallant.&#xD;
The latter enabled him to do so, without effort, by rallying him&#xD;
on the score of his amour.&#xD;
"Where were you last night, 'Philip? You' promised to be&#xD;
with us, and broke faith. Truth to say, we had the merriest&#xD;
night of it in the tent of Juan de Anasco. Better flasks of Xe~es'&#xD;
were never opened to Don Ferdinand. All cried aloud against&#xD;
you, and cursed your drowsy courtship, which seems to be noto-&#xD;
rious throughout the Island. Now, my good fellow, if you must&#xD;
be in love, there is no good reason why you should' be out of the&#xD;

world. Every body asks for you-they all look for you mv&#xD;
You are lost to all good fellowship."&#xD;
A' You are likely to lose me still more completely than&#xD;
do now, Nuno. Some day you will fail to see me altogether&#xD;
mean, indeed, to separate myself wholly from such a band&#xD;
vicious profligates, who have no faith in anything more lo~&#xD;
than ~ pearl oyster, and yield their hearts to nothing less per~&#xD;
sive than a gold mine. What should I do with such people;&#xD;
who still believe in lQve and beauty, and have a heart still o&#xD;
to the pleadings of a womail? That I do love is sufficient re~&#xD;
why I should leave such companions. From this day I am gc&#xD;
to quit you all. I propose ev~n to forego the expedition to F&#xD;
ida. It needs me not;' and there are good reasons wherefore&#xD;
should abandon it."&#xD;
"Now the blessed saints foref'end, that~ you should speak E&#xD;
ously this resolution, my friend. Why, Philip de Vasconse&#xD;
this is mere madness. What reasons can you have'? That&#xD;
love and would marry, and may marry Olivia de Alvaro, is&#xD;
sufficient cause, I trow, since the one stands not in the way of'&#xD;
other, if there be any settled purpose in your mind to go."&#xD;
"Aye, but there is none."&#xD;
"How! I thought your going with the expedition was quil&#xD;
~ett1ed matter. I know that the Adelantado counts confided&#xD;
~pon your going, and holds it of large importance to the interest~&#xD;
~he e4edition that you should go: for you are the only person&#xD;
~ll the party who knows the tongue of the Floridian, and thej&#xD;
~ages to his country."&#xD;
"I did, in some degree, prepare and consent to depart '~&#xD;
the Adelantado, but if he counts upon my going and values&#xD;
performance, he hath taken but a strange course for showing&#xD;
the estimate he hath of my services."&#xD;
"Truth, he hath neglected you somewhat."&#xD;
* "But this availeth little, and I have no regrets and no c&#xD;
plaints. Let it suffice for you, Nuno, that, for the time, the r&#xD;
sion for warlike adventure hath gone utterly out of my heart.&#xD;

"Shame on thee, Vasconselos, that thow-~shouldst make s~rch&#xD;
confession! I will report thee for a haggard through the ar y.&#xD;
I too have had my passions and my loves, as thou knowest, and&#xD;
I could, on occasion, play me a merry turn of sadness upon the&#xD;
guitar beneath my lady's lattice, even now; but that she should&#xD;
wean me from my love of shield and spear, were impossible! I&#xD;
must not believe thee.~~&#xD;

and care nothing for all the gold and treasure of the Floridia~n."&#xD;
" It will greatly anger the adelantado when he hears of thy&#xD;
decision."&#xD;
"Nay, I think he is somewhat prepared for it. He hath&#xD;
treated me with neglect from the beginning, in all substantial&#xD;
things, and he now shows me a cold courtesy, which argues hos-&#xD;

A      I could only go as a simple volunteer, the aid to a superior who&#xD;
hath shown me aversion. Seest thou not how little motive is&#xD;
there left me for this adventure'? Even the pag~ who heil~ed&#xD;

on my brother, and is his paid follower; and this reminds&#xD;
Nuno, that I am seeking to buy me a well-made lilackarnoor ;-&#xD;

and I, too, see, Philip, and we have no doubts. It is your 4&#xD;
modesty alone that seeks for them, and builds them up liii&#xD;

between promise and performance. They make the heart&#xD;

amuse the island, by telling aloud this purpose of mine to ab~n-&#xD;

been too much held in disesteem by your proud Spaniards, an~l I&#xD;
am resolved to lower some of the haughty crests, which have&#xD;
abused the courtesy of knighthood. It wilibe, perchance, a soler~in&#xD;

spear to the Gods of the Harvest-and set up an altar to peale,&#xD;
where hitherto I have bowed only to that of war&#xD;

firm in her resolution. But, is it possible? Can I trust her ~&#xD;
Is any woman to be trusted.where her heart is full of the one ob-&#xD;
ject, where the passions are young and vigorous, a~d where the&#xD;
opportunities are free? She will tremble and hesitate, and be&#xD;
coy-recede, yet loiter,-listen, and finally, forgetting everything&#xD;
except the passion which she feels, she will fall into his 'arms, and&#xD;
he will drink the moist, warm consent from her burning lips. So&#xD;
it has been ever-so it will be ever-to the end of the history.&#xD;
I have studied the sex in vain if it be not so !-and how to prevent&#xD;
all this, for it must be prevented! The Adelantado must persuade&#xD;
this knight to continue with the expedition. He must win him. He&#xD;
hath the charm to do this, when he is persuaded to use it; and he&#xD;
must use it ~iow. He must make him a captain of twenties-nat,&#xD;
hundreds-but he must bear him~off; and meanwhile, it must be&#xD;
for me to encourage him with a promise of Olivia on his return&#xD;
from the expedition. To gain time is now the thing essential.&#xD;
The rest may be left to the thousand casualties of such an adven-&#xD;
ture as that on which we depart. But should~ these arts fail!&#xD;
should the persuasions of the Adelantado come too late-should&#xD;
the pride of this knight of Portugal reject~ our overtures with&#xD;
scorn, as percht~nce he may-~should my promise of Olivia, on&#xD;
his return, not satis y him-as, in faith, her encouragement liath&#xD;
been sufficient to m ke it unsatisfactory-what remains? Verily,&#xD;

interposed, gently but earnestly, the more sedate&#xD;
wife, the lady Isabella-" nay, my Lord, this is&#xD;

acting spirit, or win the countenance of the unworthy. He but&#xD;
counsels, as' I have striven to do, that in the case of these brave&#xD;
knights of Portugal, wl~om none hold to be less than honorable&#xD;
in very high degree, thou shouldst assume a different beating&#xD;
from that which is but too common for our Spaninrds to show.&#xD;
to these gentlemen. Verily, I say ~ayse1f) they have been quite&#xD;
too much slighted in this adventure, the more especially when&#xD;
we remember the c~aimsof Don Philip, not merely as a brave&#xD;
warrior, and polished gentleman, but on account of the special&#xD;
qualities which he possesses from a former sojourn with the&#xD;
Floridian of Apala9hia. And where is the shame and the dis-&#xD;
credit to thee of seeking and soliciting this 5ble and his brother?&#xD;
Dost thou not solicit many,-many who are far less worthy?&#xD;
What is all thy to~l' here, the parade which we daily make, the&#xD;
court which we hold, the feasts we give, the pageants and tour-&#xD;
xieys we exhibit, but the fruit of a solicitude which seeks men,&#xD;
and money and hoi~ses,-and all that is denied needful to the&#xD;
success and glory of thy enterprise? Of a truth, my Lord, I&#xD;
see, as I have long seen, that there is no true wisdomTh looking&#xD;
coldly on these brave spirits, who, I doubt not, will be most happy&#xD;
of thy favor, and most hearty in thy cause."&#xD;
The Adelantado trode the floor with hasty strides while his&#xD;
wife was speaking. Whe~i she had done, he spoke.&#xD;
"I see not what ye would have. I gave these knights all the&#xD;
countenance that was possible. They were entreated to our pres-&#xD;
ence; they were dealt honorably with when they came. I could&#xD;
not strip command from other of my followers, born Castilians,&#xD;
who brought with them their own retainers. I could not for my&#xD;
own dignity, abridge my o~yn command, that they should find&#xD;
the followers whom they did~ not bring. I dared not give them&#xD;
high places in the expedition, knowing well the jealousy of our&#xD;
people towards the foreigners. But, I trow, all this complaint&#xD;
of neglect had never been, Don Balthazar, had it not been for&#xD;
thy niece. It is the passion of this knight for the Lady Olivia,&#xD;
and, perchance, thy hostility to his object, which hath marred his&#xD;
purpose, and not any lack of my favor. He ha&amp;amp;..gone, as so&#xD;
&#xD;
DON BALTHAZAR'S TAOTIO~.              187&#xD;
many do, an individual adventurer, a single lance and sword,&#xD;
but for his passion for thy niece; and thou, I wot, hath put lliy&#xD;
ban upon is affection."&#xD;
"I have put no ban upon his affections, your excellence, nor&#xD;
upon hers. He is free to come and go, and he ~ees my niece&#xD;
when he w~ll. I have not forbidden him; I do ?iot purpose~ to&#xD;
forbid. If he seeks her in marriage, and she affects him, I with-&#xD;
hold no co sent."&#xD;
"Thou ast changed in thy resolve since we last spoke of&#xD;
these parti s !" said Donna Isabella.&#xD;
"True, our Ladyship. I hearkened to your counsels, and re~.&#xD;
solved in c mpliance with them. But it is, perchance, for this&#xD;
very reaso that he hath declined the expedition. Had I barred&#xD;
his passage to the Lady Olivia, he had been less hopeful. I am&#xD;
free to say that I believe she hath large power over him."&#xD;
"And h over her," quoth the Lady Isabella, "or the Woman's&#xD;
eyes have ~n this greatly mistaken the usual signs of the woman's&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"Well!' exclaimed Hernan de Soto, breaking in with ir~ipa..&#xD;
tience, "w4~1, and what is to come of it? Will ~he sink into&#xD;
the~ drudge~upon a vineyard? Will he become fruit-pruner on&#xD;
the hacienda of the Lady Olivia de Alvaro, and prepare his&#xD;
monthly accounts, as steward and agent, for the examination of&#xD;
the severe efior Don Balthazar? Think'st thou to bring him&#xD;
to this? an it be that one of the bravest and best lances in&#xD;
Portugal- y~ and Spain-will be content with this petty employ&#xD;
in life wif e great deeds are done in Florida-he who, but a&#xD;
month ago, had an ambition for conquest, and a passion for enter-&#xD;
prise, equa to that of the most eager adventurer in Cuba?&#xD;
Then is kni hthood greatly altered in spirit in the last decade;&#xD;
and one as he reads may well wQnder if the deeds of Hernan de&#xD;
Cordova a e not in faith a pure fable,-a silly invention of the&#xD;
poet. Go to, Don Balthazar, you shall not persuade me to&#xD;
this."&#xD;
"I woul persuade you to nothing, you excellence, which you&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7781-00000072"/>&#xD;
deem hurtful to your honor or your interests, oIf which you find&#xD;
displeasing to your moods. You hear what is .reported as comn-&#xD;
ing from Don Philip himself. I' believe the rumor, and think&#xD;
that he hath so expressed himself. It is for you to say whether&#xD;
the loss of this knight,-perchance his younger brother also,-be&#xD;
such loss as you can suffer without grievance."&#xD;
" Of a truth, not ! we want every man whom we can gkt, and&#xD;
every brave knight in. especial,-particularly one who brings with&#xD;
him such manifold resources as Philip de Vasconselos."&#xD;
" This being the case, your excellency, it may be we,11 to ask,&#xD;
in what way, without derogation from your high dignity, to per-&#xD;
suade him to the adventure. I have shown you wherefore I&#xD;
think he hath resolved to quit your banner ;-the neglect of&#xD;
favor ;-the jealousy of our Spaniards, and the passion which he&#xD;
hath for my niece."&#xD;
" When thou sawest these 'things, and that the hope of thy&#xD;
niece was that which made him hostile to the expedition, why&#xD;
then didst thou give encouragement to this puling passion for the&#xD;
damsel'?"&#xD;
-"Nay, my lord, thou art again unreasonable," interposed&#xD;
Donna Isabella. "If there be offence in that, the gdilt of it lies&#xD;
at thy door and mine. Don Balthazar, as thou wilt recall, de-&#xD;
clared himself in opposition to the suit of the knight of Portugal,&#xD;
giving, as reason for it, the very peril which we now fear, that he&#xD;
would abandon the expedition if successful with the lady. Was&#xD;
it not so, Don Balthazar ?"&#xD;
Don Balthazar bowed assent, and then proceeded in reply to&#xD;
De Soto. -&#xD;
"I gave no encouragement, your excellency, to .this passion.&#xD;
In truth, for many reasons I was greatly hostile to it. The calm,&#xD;
and, as seemed to me, as I trow it did to you, the insolent pride&#xD;
of this knight's bearing was rarely inconsistent with his poverty&#xD;
of position and resource, and I felt a pride of nation which re-&#xD;
volted to think that the large possessions of my niece should fall&#xD;
into the= clutch .of a beggarly and grasping stranger. I had&#xD;
&#xD;
19;&#xD;
&#xD;
chosen another suitor for her-one Don Augustin de Sinolar, a&#xD;
worthy gentleman, and a handsome, whose estates lie adjoining&#xD;
those of my niece at the hacienda Matelos."&#xD;
" And didst thou really seek to match-thy niece with that thing&#xD;
of silk and straw, De Sinolar ? Fie upon thee, Don Balthazar--&#xD;
fie upon thee, for designing a most unworthy sacrifice."&#xD;
.The face of Don Baithazar flushed to the temples, as he listened&#xD;
to the rebuke of the Lady Isabella, and felt the sharp indignant&#xD;
glance of her eye upon him. But he had his reply.&#xD;
."He is rich, lady, and hath a good exterior. He hath the&#xD;
vanities of youth, perchance ; I deny it not ; but he hath few of&#xD;
the vices of youth. He hath meekness, and gentleness, and sim-&#xD;
plicity, and '&#xD;
" Oh ! hush thee, Don Balthazar; as if the qualities of a chicken&#xD;
or a hare were sufficient to, satisfy the heart of a woman. Fie;&#xD;
upon thee."&#xD;
" Briefly," interposed De Soto, "she rejects your favorite&#xD;
De Sinolar, cnd must have your knight of Portugal."&#xD;
"ffy choice was not hers, and, though the Lady Isabella re-&#xD;
bukes me, I must say I am sorry for it. Olivia had been much&#xD;
happier, I trdw, with De Sinolar, than she ever could hope to be&#xD;
with Philip de Vasconselos."&#xD;
" And why not, I pray you ?" again .spoke the Lady Isabella,&#xD;
showing a fe mine tenacity on a subject which so naturally inter-&#xD;
ested the pride and temper of the sex.&#xD;
"Nay, it d es not matter to our present quest," said De Soto,&#xD;
" The question is, does she resolve to wed the Portuguese?"&#xD;
"She- prefers him, beyond all question, but that she will wed&#xD;
with him is still-as who can answer for-the caprices of the&#xD;
sex ?"--and this was said with a sly glance at the Lady Isabella-.&#xD;
"is still a very questionable matter."&#xD;
" Nay, if she prefers him, and he seeks her, there is an end of&#xD;
the doubt. . ou do not bar the progress, and none denies. She&#xD;
will wed with him, I see, and he is lost to the expedition--a loss&#xD;
greater than fty matchlocks !"&#xD;

&#xD;
De Soto strode the apartment with a vexation which he did&#xD;
not labor to conceal. Now, that the loss of the knight seemed&#xD;
to be certain, he was at no pains to conceal his conviction of his&#xD;
value. The truth is that, as Don Balthazar had indicated already,&#xD;
the pride in the bearing of Don Philip de Vasconselos, and the&#xD;
stately reserve which he maintained to the Castilian leaders, De&#xD;
Soto among them, had touched the self-esteem of the latter.&#xD;
Yet this conduct of the Portuguese was not properly a cause of&#xD;
wonder 6r complaint, when it was remembered with what open&#xD;
jealousy he was regarded by the Spaniards. Don Balthazar&#xD;
watched his superior with keen eyes, but a calm, unspeaking&#xD;
countenance. After a brief pause, h~ spoke as follows:&#xD;
"Nay, your Excellency, it does not seem so necessary that the&#xD;
Knight should be lost to the expedition, even should he wed with&#xD;
my niece. He may be persuaded to follow it after he hath wed-&#xD;
ded -"&#xD;
"Better before !" said the Lady Isabella with a smile.&#xD;
"Yes, I grant you, better before; and, whatever attempts we&#xD;
make upon him should be 8eaSOflably tried; but, failing to pre..&#xD;
vent his bridal-which, I repeat, is by no means an assured thing&#xD;
-then we may negotiate that he follow thee when the honey-moon&#xD;
is ov~r. Thou wilt suffer one or more small caravels to remain&#xD;
from thy fleet, wherewith to bring stores after thee, and the sick&#xD;
soldiers, and in one of th~se he may easily depart with others.&#xD;
Thou wilt hardly feel his loss ere he is with thee. Thou wilt&#xD;
consume several weeks in thy progress along, and thy descent&#xD;
upon the coast-rn the unloading of thy caramels, the landing of&#xD;
the horses, hogs and cattle, and in other needful preparations.&#xD;
When thou art ready to penetrate the country' of the Apalachi-&#xD;
an, he' will, if we use the proper means of persuasion, be with&#xD;
thee in ~&#xD;
"And these means of persuasion. Sant' Jago! Shall I go to&#xD;
this Knight of Portugal, and bend myself before him, and say,&#xD;
'Sir Knight, wilt thou honor thy servant by taking thy part in&#xD;
this expedition'?"'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE EMISSARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nay, nay, my lord -" began the lady, but the Adelantado&#xD;
waved his hand impatiently, looking to Balthazar. The latter&#xD;
did not delay his answer&#xD;
"Will your Excellency leave this matter wholly to me? I&#xD;
will use what proper arguments I may. I will in no respect com-&#xD;
mit thy pride or honor. I will promise office, and the command&#xD;
of a troop, yet in no way conflict with thy engagements.7'&#xD;
"How wilt thou do this ?"&#xD;
"Nay, w~ill it n t suffice that it shall be done ?"&#xD;
"In God s nam , do it; I shall say no more. Thou wilt re-&#xD;
lieve me of an e barras~inent; and if thou succeed'st with this&#xD;
churlish cavalier, ill do ~melp to the enterprise, as none better&#xD;
knows than thou! Away, Don Balthazar, and let the grass not&#xD;
grow beneath thy cet. To-morrow thou knowes~t the tournament&#xD;
begins, and there i much work for thee here as elsewhere. To&#xD;
thy papers, my se retary-.---my soul, ratl~er !"&#xD;
And witl~ this s perb compliment, the stately Don turned, to&#xD;
his wife, a~d pr needed to dictate as she wrote. Don Bal~&#xD;
thazar, havi~ig cart blanche, made his bow and took his departtrre.&#xD;
lie lost no time i visiting Philip de Vas&amp;amp;onselos. The office&#xD;
was one which the uncle of Olivia would have cheerfully deputed&#xD;
to another; but t s was impossible; and he proceeded accord-&#xD;
ingly to the work before him, with the promptitude of one to&#xD;
whom the duty is apparent. His hope lay. in the temptation&#xD;
which he would ho d forth to the ambition of the adventurer.&#xD;
having himself litt e faith in the affections as sufficiently compen-&#xD;
sative to man, he persuaded himself that the aim of Philip de&#xD;
Yasconselos was t e fortune of his ward. If he could hold forth&#xD;
a sufficient lure of the same character through another medium,&#xD;
he flattered himself that he should be successful. None c~oubted&#xD;
that Florida and t e mountains of Apalachia concealed treasures&#xD;
in gold and silver, ems and precious stones, equal to any in the&#xD;
keeping of Peru. He knew that this faith was especially taught&#xD;
by the Portuguese who h~d been one of the explorers of that&#xD;
country with the cavalier Cabeza de Va~a. All that seemed&#xD;
essential, therefore to beguiling him to the enterprise, was to&#xD;

mollify his pride, and secure him the means of going thither in a&#xD;
style which should maintain his dignity and afford him an ade-&#xD;
quate command. For this money was necessary, and De Soto&#xD;
had none to spare. The resolution which Don Ealthazar had&#xD;
formed, was to use~ the means afforded him by the large income&#xD;
from the estate of his niece, of which he had con~plete control.&#xD;
To employ the wealth of Olivia in ridding her of two dangerous&#xD;
- lovers, seemed to him a perfectly legitimate measure; though,&#xD;
in respect to the propriety of the proceeding, he never allowed&#xD;
himself to doubt for a moment. Thus prepared with his gen.&#xD;
eral plan of action, he entered the humble dwelling of the Knight&#xD;
of Portugal.&#xD;
Philip de Yasconselos beheld the approach of the unusual vis-&#xD;
itor without surprise. He had, in fact, anticipated the unwanted&#xD;
courtesy, and we may add, had partly designed it should be so,&#xD;
when he instructed his friends to declare aloud his determination.&#xD;
lie knew quite as well as aiiy other person, how necessary he&#xD;
was to the purposes of De Soto. The appearance of Don Bal-&#xD;
tliazar seemed to assure him also of the conviction felt by the&#xD;
latter that his niece would favor the suit of the Portuguese. The&#xD;
instincts of Philip de Yasconselos on this subject had been&#xD;
strengthened by the positive reports of Nuno de Tobar. They&#xD;
were confirmed by the visit of the uncle. His hands were ac-&#xD;
cordingly strengthened. He was prepared for the interview.&#xD;
Though yet a young man, hardly more than thirty, he had been&#xD;
a soldier; had travelled much; mingled much with men; en.&#xD;
dured those vicissitudes which strengthen patience, teach coolness,&#xD;
and give insight; and with a mind naturally acute, and a judg&#xD;
ment well balanced and secure, he was more than a match foi&#xD;
men of greater age and as much experience. He was a politician&#xD;
over who~m the habitual cunning of Don Balthazar could obtain&#xD;
no advantage. It was a curious study to watch the interview&#xD;
between the parties-to behold the Castilian Don doubling like a&#xD;
fox through all the avenues of his art; to see him circling around&#xD;
his object, without approaching it; to note how warily he kept,&#xD;
in regard to his secret fears, while holding forth his rno~t beguib&#xD;
&#xD;

doubt that he, Don Balthazar, could be other&#xD;

He returned with all diligence to the presence of the Adelan.&#xD;
tado, whom he found in the most joyous mood. The change of&#xD;
a couple of hours had effected wonders. When he left his pres.&#xD;
ence De Soto was angry and sullen. Now his mirth was abso-&#xD;
lutely boisterous. In this merriment, though more temperately,&#xD;
Donna Isabella shared. Don Baithazar looked on with wonder,&#xD;
and several times~ vainly essayed to speak. He was always&#xD;
overborne by the laughter of his superior.&#xD;
"Tell me nothing yet," cried De Soto, at an interval in his&#xD;
bursts of mirth,'-." Nothing that shall qualify my pleasure. Ha!&#xD;
ha! ha! wait, good Don Balthazar, till I can recover breath, when&#xD;
you shall hear, and then, if it be not wholly against your princi.&#xD;
ple, you shall laugh too."&#xD;
"Ay, ay, your excellence, as Sancho counsels, 'Let not thy&#xD;
secret rot in thy keeping!"'&#xD;
"Ere long it will be no secret. The story is too good to be&#xD;
kept from air. It must be sent abroad, and no doubt will gain&#xD;
addition as it goes. Thus, then, there were some bar ques that&#xD;
put into pQrt, as thou knowest, from stress of weather yesterday.&#xD;
One of them had spru~ig aleak, and needed repair. On board of&#xD;
this vessel came Hernan Ponce, an old comrade of mine in Peru.&#xD;
We were dear friends in Peru, and we made a brotherhood be-&#xD;
tween us, which is, as thou knowest,, a copartnership for common&#xD;
interests and profits, to last through life. We were thus to share&#xD;
our gains and losses equally, our honors as our profits."&#xD;
"Ah! and he now comes to claim of thee the half of thy state&#xD;
here, and thy command in the expedition ?"&#xD;
"Nothing half so good, Don Balthazar. He claims nothing at&#xD;
my hands, but his aim is to escape from claims of mine. Thou&#xD;
must know, then, that Reman Ponce hath made great profits in&#xD;

"Eh ! why not? He shall see-the sordid runagate, that I&#xD;

"Which is clearly forfeit."&#xD;
"Nay, the dog. I will not keep his treasure from him. I will&#xD;

It was probably the ad ~ce of the lady that led De Soto to his&#xD;
determination. He was r ther inclined to grasp at treasure from&#xD;
whatever source, and his reputation is not above the reproach of&#xD;
an unbecoming avarice. While they were yet speaking, the&#xD;

'thou dost unwisely in restoring him his treasure. Better wert.&#xD;

gone no apparent disturbance since the death f old Anita, and&#xD;
Sylvia, her mesti 0 successor, seemed ~o fall s naturally into&#xD;
her habits, as if sh had .been trained directly u der them. No&#xD;
doubt the stern di cipline of her master had t tored her to un-&#xD;
plicit obedience, w 1e his precaution haci left nothing doubtful&#xD;
in the directions w ch he gave her for her go eminent during&#xD;
his absence~. But we may mention here, that e girl Juana, if&#xD;
not refractory, was inattentive, and the old hag ho now super-&#xD;
intended the house old had occasion to notice er frequent and&#xD;
prolonged absences~ for Which the girl, on her me urn, was unwill-&#xD;
ing, or unable to account. Once or twice during the progress of&#xD;
the last twenty-four~ hours, ha~ Sylvia fe1~t it in umbent on her&#xD;
to administer an exj~ressive cuff or two t~ the ch eks of the sul-&#xD;
len servant, winding~ up these salutary admonitio s with threats&#xD;
of' more potent handling, and a final appeal to on Balthazar.&#xD;

lover-that he did ~iot make his appearance, as her uncle feared,&#xD;
as her friend' Leono~a de Tobar had asserted he would appear,&#xD;
and as she felt itcr~minal to hope. A morning visit from Leo..&#xD;
nora, the thoughtless, the joyous, upon whom neither shame nor&#xD;
sorrow seemed to ~it long, gave her all the little tattle of the&#xD;
town; and she ran on, with tongue at random, discoursing of a&#xD;
thousand matters in whieh Olivia took no interest. It was only&#xD;
when Philip de Va~conselos became the subject, that the visitor&#xD;
found an expressio4 of eagerness and concern in the eyes of her&#xD;
suffering hostess.&#xD;
"It is certain th~t he loves you to distraction, Olivia. Nuno&#xD;
says so, and he ought to know; and I suppose he could tell me&#xD;
a greali many things to p~'ove it; but he won't. He says Philip&#xD;
is his friend, and ~ie can't betray his friend's secrets. As if a&#xD;
husband should .h4ve any secrets from hi~ wife; and as if I&#xD;
couldn't keep a se~ret. Now you know, Olivia, nobody better&#xD;
keeps a secret then I. I never tell. any thing-never! My&#xD;
mouth is sealed upbn a secret, as solemnly and sacredly, Livy,&#xD;
as if it were a-a ~rh~it ?-why a kiss, to be sure. He might4rust&#xD;
me; I'm sure, with every thing he knows-with every thing he's&#xD;
seen and done, and not a syllable should ever pass my lips.&#xD;
And yet, would you believe it, when I ask him about your Philip&#xD;
and his secrets, only to tell you every thing, why he tells me&#xD;
that Philip says he will tell ix~e;. and that I will tell you, and then&#xD;
every body will ki~iow every thing. The fact is, Livy, one thing&#xD;
is very certain to me, that if your Philip speaks in that way-&#xD;
though I don't believe a word of it-he's a very saucy person,&#xD;
and Nuno should r~ot listen to him. But Nuno believes him the&#xD;
best fell6'w~ in the I world, and says he loves him next to me.&#xD;
Not close, you know, but far off-that ~s, he has no friendship&#xD;
for anybody betwixt him and me. Now I'll l~t you into a great&#xD;

"But I haven't told you half of my secrets. Nuno says that&#xD;

"No! and by. t1~e way, Livy, that's what I have to quarrel&#xD;

"And why not? it's because you won't have them, then. If&#xD;
I were yon, I should have nothing else. I should live in hope all&#xD;
the day,'and dream 6f pleasures all the night. The world should&#xD;
bring me nothing' but love and sunshine, and every thought of&#xD;
my soul should be born in the odor of a thousand flowers. And&#xD;
why should your happiness not be like mine~..you who have the&#xD;
means to make it so? Now don't think to cheat me with those&#xD;

took u~e with him yesterday, to seethe lists and barriers. They&#xD;
have raised them ju~t without the city, in a natural amphitheatre&#xD;
among the hills. There is a great enclosure for the bull-fights.&#xD;
We are to have the most splendid bull-fights, as' brave as any&#xD;
thing they have in Spain. They brought in a dozen great beasts&#xD;
yesterday from the mountains-the finest animals in the world;&#xD;
all 'as wild as tigers. Several famous matadors have come with&#xD;
them, and' w~e are to have' such sport. They ha4e raised high&#xD;
scaffolds for the noble p'3ople and the ladies, and in the centre is&#xD;
one- with a canopy for the Adelantado and the Lady Isabella, and&#xD;
their immediate friends; we are to sit with them, Livy, but on&#xD;
lower seats, and 'nearer to the lists, so tha1~ the gallant Cavaliers&#xD;
can draw nigh to us, after each passage of arms, and each select&#xD;
his' Queen of Love &amp;amp;~nd Beauty. Won't'that be charming? Think&#xD;
of t t~t, Livy. 'Pm sure I know who will be among the most gal..&#xD;
lant knights, atid Pr~i sure I know who he'll choose as his Queen&#xD;

Olivia did not nswer, but she felt the force&#xD;
companion had s oken. She had already had&#xD;
by her uncle, as matter of course, that her ~&#xD;
required; and sli felt, perhaps, that there was&#xD;

"And I too can letter weep than rejoice over them, Leonora."&#xD;
" What can be the matter with the child ~ Livy, there is some-&#xD;
thing wrong-itis unnatural that you should show such fates at such&#xD;
a time-you, so young, so beautiful, with such a fortune, and with&#xD;
such a lover-with every reason, too, for believing that nothing&#xD;
can now stand in the way of your loves. Livy, I do think that&#xD;
there is something wnong~-soixiething which I cannot guess."&#xD;
For a moment the gay young woman forgot all her levity, an4&#xD;
turning from the rich dresses and the jewels, fixed her eyes on the&#xD;
gloomy features of. Olivia, with such intense and penetrating cut&#xD;
riosity, That her cheeks flushed and her eyes. fell; and she stain-&#xD;
mered rather than spoke-afraid of that suspicious gaze&#xD;
"No! nothing; only I am sick-sick atheart, Leonora. I am&#xD;
very foolish and weak! Would to Heaven I were dead 1"&#xD;
~' shocking! was ever such a foolish child! But something i~&#xD;
th~ matter, and it must be very serious to make you look and&#xD;
speak so ;-and I must know it, Livy. As your friend, you must&#xD;
tell me all. You know how well I ~an keep a secret. Come,&#xD;
dear, tell me what it is that troubles you."&#xD;
This, recalled Olivia to herself. The very appeal to her expe-&#xD;
rience in behalf of her friend's capacity to keep a secret, warned&#xD;
her of the danger threatening her. She did not philosophize ex-&#xD;
cept through her instincts; these sufficiently taught her that a&#xD;
secret, once supposed to exist, is already half discovered; and by&#xD;
a strong mental effort, she threw off her cloud for a spaces and&#xD;
allowed herself to answer prattle with prattle. She diverted her&#xD;
friend's curk~sity from herself to her garments, and in the exami-&#xD;
nation of silks, ribbons and jewels, Leonora forgot that there were&#xD;
any other mysteries in the world. Tl~us the rest of the time was&#xD;
consumed while she remained.&#xD;
q&#xD;
When her gay visitor was gone, Olivia sank into a seeming&#xD;
stupor; yet her thought was busy all the while; the mournful,&#xD;
dreary, ghostly speculation, which aimed at nothing, settled upon&#xD;
nothing, hoped for nothing, and feared everything. The day passed&#xD;
thus. Shewas unconscious mQstly when Juana madeher appearance&#xD;
in the apartment; and only roused herself to i~ep1y to the salutations&#xD;

THE SECRET ~TRANCE&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Was at the hands of Don Baithazar, in a blow from his double&#xD;
fist, which smote her to~ the eat'th~ She rose with the blood split.&#xD;
~ng from her nostrils.&#xD;
"Hence !" he e~daimed, with a voice of thunder and a brutal&#xD;
oath. " Hence! To-morrow you go to the cour~try."&#xD;
Juana disappeared-b~t not too far. She wai1~d at the door&#xD;
t~nd listened, her nose dropping blood all the whiP. She did not&#xD;
observe it. She scarcely felt the pain. The blood of the red&#xD;
inah in her veins supplied her with one feeling only, and that&#xD;
was foi~ the indignity. She listened. She reserved herself for&#xD;
her ow~ time; but resolved that she would not go. to the coun-&#xD;
try. We shall see.&#xD;
Meanwhile, a long conference folloWed between Thin Balthazar&#xD;
and Sylvia, in regard to Olivia.&#xD;
"She eats nothing that I provide her. I know not how she&#xD;
lives."&#xD;
"She has supplied herself secretly from other sources. That&#xD;
girl-." I have watched her. She has carried her noth-&#xD;
lug."&#xD;
Juana, as she listened, reproached herself that such was the&#xD;
case. She had never thought of the wants of her young mistress.&#xD;
She now resolved to supply them from her own stores. She&#xD;
now became more resolved than ever to befriend the damsel,&#xD;
who suddenly rose before her eyes as an object of sympathizing&#xD;
Interest. But she did not leave the door. She h~d still other&#xD;
things to hear.&#xD;
"Here is more of the potion 1" said Don Balthazar, giving the&#xD;
I phial. "To-morrow I will see that she goes forth. In her ab-&#xD;
sence search her apartments. If you find food; you know what&#xD;
to do with it."&#xD;
This is all that n~ed concern us of this conference. When&#xD;
Don l3althazar was ~ibout to leave the apartment, his eye caught&#xD;
sight (A' the blood upon the floor which had fallen from the nos-&#xD;
trils of Juana.&#xD;
"What is this ?" ~he said, stooping.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ha! ha 1" laughed the old woman as&#xD;
"Her nose has caught it. Your hand is not&#xD;
"She shall fli~id it heavier yet. But are&#xD;
"Yes; see h4re-drop-..-.drop......drop~eve&#xD;
The old wom~n pointed out the tracks;&#xD;
they found it in ~a puddle.&#xD;
"Ha !" exclaimed the Don, "the wench&#xD;
She has listened to all that has been said~ H&#xD;
for it. Mix the potion with her food, also.&#xD;
Olivia, well! ou end is answered. That is thE&#xD;
bribed her. Sh supplies her with food, so ti&#xD;
reject her own. Now we have her. But tal&#xD;
and when she goes forth to-morrow, search hc&#xD;
while, do you g to the room of Juana and se&#xD;
Put on a gentle anner with her. Beguile h&#xD;
your reproaches of my violence. I will go t~&#xD;
Olivia, and see i like manner after her."&#xD;
The old woma threw off her slippers and ~&#xD;
room of Juana. Don Balthazar waited awhile&#xD;
slowly, on his w y to the apartment of his nn&#xD;
yond it. When he drew nigh, he found Sylv:&#xD;
Juana's chamber.&#xD;
"She is not th re," said she in a .whisper.&#xD;
"Ha! she: is t en here !" lie pointed to 0&#xD;

arrested his speech. The face of Olivia declared her equal scorn&#xD;
and loathing. She never rose, but looking on him with pitiless&#xD;
composure, she exclaimed,-&#xD;
"This, then, is the noble process for accomplishing my de..&#xD;
struction !-worthy of a noble knight-thrice worthy a Castilian&#xD;
gentleman-and altogether becoming a guardian and a kinsman 1"&#xD;
The uncle rose, recovering himself; with the erect position.&#xD;
"Thy destruction, girl! What dost thou mean? Dost thou&#xD;
think I come to murder thee ?"&#xD;
"And what else should I think, when thou comes in such&#xD;
fashion, at such an hour, and through an avenue which is secret&#xD;
to thyself? Why shouldst :thou not murder me? and why, if&#xD;
such, be not thy object, shouldst thou thus visit my place of sleep-&#xD;

strike me to the heart, and close the eyes which now see nothing&#xD;
but mine own shame."&#xD;
"Olivin, thou art       passionate and wild !"&#xD;
"Am I then, with the sight of thee, at this hour, knowing what&#xD;
thou art, knowing what terrible wrongs thou hast done to me, and*&#xD;

Full of anger, and with a fierce oath upon his lips, Don Bal-&#xD;

below.&#xD;
"Well," said he, "hast thou found the wench, Juana ?"&#xD;
"She is gone. She is not within the house !"&#xD;
"She shall taste the Calab6zo to-morrow. See to what I have&#xD;
told thee when the Seiiorita goes forth, and make the search&#xD;

"Never you mind;" said he, at parting with her; "the goods&#xD;

To keer from the meat awhile, is to strengthen the stomach. It&#xD;
is a strong man only who can wait. He drinks long who drinks&#xD;

intercourse with Andres, and was studious so to select the sub-&#xD;
jects of his conversation, as by no possibility to prompt the&#xD;
mind of the youth to turn in the direction in ~hj~h his heart had&#xD;
suffered hurt. But Andres exhibited no sense of this prudence.&#xD;
and forbearance. lie was one of those wilful and wrong-headed,&#xD;
but otherwise noble and generous spirits, who prefer, under dis-&#xD;
appointment, to suffer and complain; who, of themselves, irritate&#xD;
the sore places which they feel, and steadily tear away the plas-&#xD;
ter with which the physician would cure all their ailments. It&#xD;
was in despair of saying or doing anything which could be ac-&#xD;
ceptable to his brother's mood, that Philip de Vasconselos finally&#xD;
forbore the effort. For the last two days, therefore, an ominous&#xD;
silence had prevailed in their cottage whe they met. Nothing&#xD;
was spoken which either might well avoid; and Philip felt with&#xD;
sorrow, that the chasm between them was l~ourly growing greater&#xD;
in depth and width. But he felt with st~il greater sorrow that&#xD;
nothing could then be done to arrest its in~rease. It was to time&#xD;
only, that great corrector, that the matter could be left.&#xD;
But time was not allowed them. The tournament approached,&#xD;
with all its excitements, appealing equally to their pride, their&#xD;
renown, and the somewhat peculiar position in which they stood&#xD;
in regard to the Castiian chivalry. Both of them, accordingly,&#xD;
might be seen, a few days before the event, busily engaged bur-&#xD;
nishii g and preparing their armor. It had already been remark-&#xD;
ed, as discreditable to the Spanish knight~, that their Portuguese&#xD;
auxiliaries were better armed, in a simpler and nobler style, and&#xD;
kept their mail and weapons under better polish than the former.&#xD;
Pe Soto himself had been compelled to refer to these knights in&#xD;
compliment on this account, and to urge their example, in order&#xD;
to prompt his Spanish cavaliers to get themselves serviceable&#xD;
armor, and to k~ep it in order. They were better pleased to&#xD;
show themselves in* gewgaws and gilt thaft in the substantial&#xD;
coverings which were essential to warfare. One of the histori-&#xD;
ans of this expedition thus contrasts the appearance of the knights&#xD;
of the two nations: "And he (the Adelantado) commanded a&#xD;
muster to be made, at the which the Portugales showed then~&#xD;

necessary as incentives to perforrflaflCe~ in the case of knights&#xD;
with whom chivalry still prevailed with all the force of a&#xD;
passion.&#xD;
Our brothers pursued their task in silence. Occupying the&#xD;
same dwelling, and with but little space in their somewhat ar-&#xD;
row limits for any performance unseen by either, this sil nec&#xD;
was an irksome one. The elder brother had made repe ted&#xD;
efforts to break through the icy reserve which prevailed in thc&#xD;
demeanor of the younger from that fatal night, the event of&#xD;
which have already been described. On that night, after heli&#xD;
passionate interview, Andres de Vasconselos had returned ron&#xD;
his lonely and gloomy wanderings, in no way irnproveJ for on~&#xD;
panionship. his affections were more stubbornly cong ale&#xD;
than ever; his passions, if less explosive, not a whit more sul&#xD;
dued or playable. A sullen rigidness was conspicuous in 1 h&#xD;
features; a gloomy inflexibility in his mood; a hostile r er~&#xD;
in his actions and deportment. This continued, increased ou&#xD;
ly by the reports of the city, touching the supposed su en&#xD;
good fortune of his brother in respect to the affections f t~&#xD;
lady of their mutual love. The kind words addressed t *hi&#xD;
by Philip were answered only in monosyllables, which w~&#xD;
sometimes more than cold, and accompanied by looks~ whi&#xD;
thc truly warm feelings of the elder brother regarded a lit&#xD;
less than savage. A becoming pity and sympathy, ho ev&#xD;

A SUMMER EVENING.                  169&#xD;
never sufThred the proper moment of Consolation to be lost.&#xD;
Such was the spirit with which Philip de Vasconselos regarded&#xD;
his wayward brother.&#xD;
It was two days yet to the opening scenes of the tourney, the&#xD;
beginning of which we have already seen. The day was at its&#xD;
close; a day all flushed with beauty, and sweet with the warm&#xD;
breathing of the budding summer. The sun was at his setting.&#xD;
His not ungrateful rays fell pleasantly gay upon the greezm slope&#xD;
which led to the slight bohio, or cottage, made of poles and reeds,&#xD;
thatched with straw, which the brothers occupied. Soft ificker-&#xD;
ing folds and remnants of purple, that seemed momently rolling&#xD;
themselves up, and disappearing with the breeze, only tcLre-ap..&#xD;
pear and spread themselves out in increasing brightness, on higher&#xD;
slopes of hill, won, at the same moment, the silent fancies of the&#xD;
brothers. The hills were fringed with faint red tints that glori-&#xD;
fied them as with heavenly halos; the woods, flushed with. the&#xD;
mingled drapery of spring and summer, lay gently waving in the&#xD;
breeze of evening, rocked in the arms of beauty, and canopied&#xD;
with the smiles of heaven. It was one of those delicious mo-&#xD;
ments when the world without passes with all its sweetness&#xD;
into the heart, and takes the whole soul into its embrace of love.&#xD;
The brothers, as by a common instinct, threw aside their toils,&#xD;
and cast themselves down upon the hill-slope, their eyes ranging&#xD;
over the blessed prospect. Their shields, of bright blue steel,&#xD;
spotless, and shining like mirrors in the sun, reflected back the&#xD;
mellow softness of his beams. They hung upon the upright poles&#xD;
without the cottage, on each side of the entrance, to which they&#xD;
furnished a rich and befitting decoration. Their long lances, of&#xD;
well-sounded and seasoned ash, headed with broad shafts of bright&#xD;
steel, that shone like silver in the sun, were leaned against the&#xD;
wall of the dwelling, and also without the entrance. The page&#xD;
of Andres, a gay boy of fourteen, had just made his obeisance,&#xD;
and taken hisdeparture, under instructions from his master; and&#xD;
for a moment, the two brothers,, reposing from their toils of the&#xD;
day, seemed disposed to snatch a respite, in the sweet calm which&#xD;
had 'descended upon all nature in the grateful approach of eve-&#xD;

ning. Andres lay at length beneath the slender shadows (&#xD;
palm, which, at an earlier hour, could have yielded no shelter&#xD;
none was needed now. His eyes were 'shrouded by his a&#xD;
which was carelessly thrown across, his brows. While in&#xD;
attitude, Philip rose suddenly from where he lay, and 'moved&#xD;
a brotherly impulse, approached him 'and threw himself qui&#xD;
by his side.&#xD;
"Andres, my brother," was the affectionate salutation of&#xD;
el&amp;amp;er, "it is naturally expected that we shall both do our de&#xD;
in the approaching tourney. It is due to~our reputation, as ~&#xD;
knights, and particularly to our position among these gentle&#xD;
of Castle, who would not be slow to remark upon any ux&#xD;
lingness which we might betray in entering the lists. They&#xD;
do their best, and we must do ours. That we can maintain&#xD;
own, and the honor ofour country, in a passage-at-arms, whE&#xD;
with lance, sword, or battle-axe, with any of these cavalic&#xD;
nothing question; though there be knights among them, n&#xD;
who, like Nuno de Tobar, will honor, by their prowess, those&#xD;
may strive against them. These will afford us sufficient exe&#xD;
and honor. It needs not, my brother, that we should cross&#xD;
pon with each other."&#xD;
A grim smile passed ov~r the features of Andres, as he&#xD;
drew his arm from above his eyes. The expression was ai&#xD;
pleasant one to Philip. A brief pause ensued. At lengt~&#xD;
younger replied:&#xD;
"Verily, Philip de Va§conselos, it were not wise to&#xD;
these knights of Castile to suppose thee unwilling to cross&#xD;
pons with any warrior, even though he were of thy own 1&#xD;
and nation. Such reluctance, in the minds of persons swo:&#xD;
cavil, might be construed into doubt of thy own capacity;&#xD;
prowess."&#xD;
'"I fear not, Andres," replied the other, calmly, "that an;&#xD;
judgment of these ~r any cavaliers will do injustice to ix&#xD;
mutation, since it will1 be easy, at any moment, particularly~&#xD;
shall never be unwilling, to satisfy any doubting opponent, ~&#xD;

that any feeling but that of a natural attachment between kins..&#xD;
men hath kept us from a trial of skill and prowess, which, though&#xD;
it be but the mimicry of strife, is yet too nearly like it, and is&#xD;
but too frequently apt to occasion the reality, not to plead against&#xD;
our indulgence, adversely, in the exercise. It is not, however,&#xD;
what the world without may think, my brother, but 'what we feel&#xD;
within, which should control our wishes in this matter. It is&#xD;
enough for me that, even in sport, I love 'not' to confront with&#xD;
weapon the bosom of a brother who is so very dear to mine."&#xD;
"Brother, mine, I do not quite understand these refinements.&#xD;
We have crossed weapons in the tourney a thousand times ere&#xD;
this, in our early exercises,-nay, in the very training which thou&#xD;
hast given me, and which, as a grateful pupil,"-~this was spoken&#xD;
with a smile by no means pleasing in the eyes of Philip,-.."I am&#xD;
* only too glad to have received at thy hands. What is there now&#xD;
to make the difference ?"&#xD;
"Ask thy own heart, Andres," replied the other, sadly. "Art&#xD;
thou the same person that thou wast, when, without a care or&#xD;
* thought but of the art which thou hadst in thy desfte, thou took'st&#xD;
thy first lessons from my lance? Since that day thou hast&#xD;
mingled, for thyself, in the press of knights; thou hast shared&#xD;
the eager fury of the battle; thou hast won for thyself a name&#xD;
which thou must maintain, at all perils, to thyself and others.&#xD;
But thou hast other feelings, fears and hopes than' those which&#xD;
possessed thee when a boy; thou hast grown a man of cares;&#xD;
and, I grieve to think it, my brotherthou no longer look'st upon&#xD;
me, thy Philip, as the loving friend from whom came thy first&#xD;
lessons in arts and arms. These make 'it prudent and proper&#xD;
that we should not strive against each other. The accidents of&#xD;
the tourney are, of themselves, sufficient to keep our arms asun.-&#xD;
der. Men have been slain, ui wittingly by their rival knights,&#xD;
Through false footing of their horse; through frailty and fault in&#xD;
arm; through haste; through~indiscretion, and those nameless&#xD;
providence of the conflict, of which no man can well account, as&#xD;
no wisdom can foresee. 1I~ut chiefly do I desire that we should&#xD;
not find our weapons crossed, inasmuch as [perceive in thee, my&#xD;

brother, a decline of that trust in me-that love, which, of (&#xD;
made it pleasant to me to teach thy inexperience."&#xD;
"I am no longer inexperienced, Philip de Vasconselos. I&#xD;
longer need thy teaching, or that of any man! Thou talk's&#xD;
accidents from weakness, and defect of armor. Never bei&#xD;
armor than mine, as thou knowest, came from the forge of&#xD;
Milanese. It had its fashion from the same hands with thine,&#xD;
is, I warrant me, as free from frailty. My lance is under ti&#xD;
eye. The sword which I carry has been a thousand times wi&#xD;
thy grasp. Thou canst tell the weight of my battle-axe,&#xD;
knowest the value of its tempered metal as certainly as thou&#xD;
thine own. What remains? Methinks, my brother, there 1&#xD;
such difference between the strength and size of my body an&#xD;
thine. Take the muscle of this armwithin thy grasp. Doth it s]&#xD;
to thee a feebleness which should make it shrink from any st&#xD;
gle with any cavalier, even though he be of redoubtable prow&#xD;
like thyself? Thou speak'st of what is in my heart ;-of a ch~&#xD;
In my feelings towards thee !-it may be there is such a ohai&#xD;
Verily, I see nothing in my fortunes or in thine, Philip de&#xD;
conselos, which should make me regard thee with feelings stu&#xD;
we bore to one another, when thou stood'st not in the way of&#xD;
hopes, and hadst not yet shrouded my heart, in the overwh&#xD;
ing shadow of thy greater fame! I reproach thee not, that&#xD;
has been thy fortune; but verily, it is no longer seasonable&#xD;
thee, to discourse to me of the love of kinsmen; and I tell&#xD;
more, Philip de VasconselOs, thou hast but too much the hab&#xD;
speaking to me as if I were still the boy, untaught, and only&#xD;
receiving from thee, for the first time, his infant lessons in th&#xD;
of blunt spear and shielded weapon."&#xD;
"And is it thus, my brother ?"' was the mournful answ~&#xD;
Philip de V~sconselos.&#xD;
"But I will not upbraid thee; and yet I will not forbear 1&#xD;
treat thee. The feeling which thou showiest is most cert&#xD;
enough to make me unwilling to encounter with thee in this&#xD;
ney. Were it possible, without shame and discredit, to reft&#xD;

thee, making thee blind to thybetter feelings, and to the claims of&#xD;
those about thee, and which, I grieve to say it, has but too fre-&#xD;
quently shown itself in thy moods of late. Brother, hearken to&#xD;
me ;4 pray thee let us not meet! Thou wilt find many noble&#xD;
knights to conquer, who will do thee honor. There will be no&#xD;
lack of the fit antagonist, even though Hernan de Soto himself&#xD;
shall take the field. Let us do nothing which may perchance&#xD;
lessen or change that love which our mother gave us, and which&#xD;
should be dear to u~, because of her, as because of ourselves."&#xD;
"It is on my account-for me-that thou wouldst avoid the&#xD;
encounter with me !" replied the younger brother. "Verily,&#xD;
Philip, thou ha t betrayed thy modesty. Is it so sure that my&#xD;
lance must fail hen it crOsses thine ?-is thy arm-"&#xD;
"Nay, broth r, why thus wilt thou mistake my purpose ?-.&#xD;

prowess when I tell thee that it is on thy account, wholly, that I&#xD;
woul~cl avoid thi encounter. I fear that thou wilt wrong thyself;&#xD;

"Andres, let not the sun set on this disagreement. I feel that&#xD;
thou dost me wrong, but I implore thee as if the wrong were&#xD;

the last distant~ billows of the sea, he said coldly-&#xD;

HAVANA, at the period of the events which we record, was a&#xD;
growing hamlet of little more than a hundred dwellings.  3ut&#xD;
a brief space before the arrival of Don Hernan de Soto in the&#xD;
island, there had been an invasion oIU the French, by whom~ the&#xD;
little city had been laid in ashes. It had been one of his duties,&#xD;
on his~ arrival, which had not been neglected in consequence of&#xD;
his preparations for Florida, to rebuild the town, which he had&#xD;
been doing with all his energy, and with a free exercise of his&#xD;
powers as Adelantado. To him the Habanese owe the erection&#xD;
of the first fort which the place ever possessed. It will be for&#xD;
the Cuban antiquarians of the present time to fix its location. As a&#xD;
matter of cGurse, we are not to look to the works of De Soto, in&#xD;
rebuilding the city, for the evidences of his architectural tastes,&#xD;
or for any enduring proofs of the labor of his hands. The place&#xD;
then afforded but an imperfect idea of the noble and imposing&#xD;
city that we find it now. She then possessed none of those old&#xD;
gray towers and massive structures, which now assail the vision,&#xD;
and command the admiration of the spectator. Her heights and&#xD;
harbors were not then, as now, covered with the mighty and&#xD;
frowning fortresses that stretch themselves around her, with a&#xD;
hundred thousand guardian hands grasping bolts of iron terror&#xD;
for her protection. But, if less threatening and powerful, she was&#xD;
not less lovely and attractive. Her beautiful bay, then as now,&#xD;

persuasive as that famous one of the Italian; and, in the luxu&#xD;
of her verdure, which covered, with a various and delicious b&#xD;
all her heights; in the intense brilliance and clearness of her&#xD;
light, which seemed rather to hallow and to soften, than to]&#xD;
the individuality and distinctness of objects, as beheld by d~&#xD;
the exquisite fragrance from her groves, and the soothing&#xD;
ness of the sea~breeze-which, in that tropical climate, 4&#xD;

a condition, in which life can offer nothing more gr teful, o&#xD;
fresh; and, to be sure of which always, ambition ight v&#xD;
satisfied to lay aside his spear and shield forever. Her C(&#xD;
each as it were enshrined amidst an empire of ruits a&#xD;
grace, already wore that aspect which, in oriental regions,&#xD;

vagabondage, and so irresistibly persuasive, that one wi&#xD;
ceases to wonder that a people, having such posses ions, sh&#xD;
content to seek nothing farther-should demand nothing~&#xD;

been trained to endurance, strife, and all sorts of' adventure, by&#xD;
the unceasing struggles of three hundred years. The benign cli-&#xD;
mate had not yet done the work of emasculation-perhaps never&#xD;
would have done this work, if the surrounding savages had been&#xD;
left partially unconquered. Had the Spaniards, with the profound&#xD;
policy which is said to have marked the history of Aztec supre-&#xD;
macy, suffered rival and hostile races still to exist, upon whom pe-&#xD;
riodically their young warriors could exercise their weapons, the&#xD;
vigorous energies of their peopl&amp;amp; might have been trained to re-&#xD;
sist all the . blandishments of climate. As yet, they remained&#xD;
unimpaired by its insidious sweetness. The savage still harbored&#xD;
in the mountains; the Caribbee still fed upon his captive along the&#xD;
margin of the gulf; the Apalachian, a fearless warrior, still roved.&#xD;
unconquered in his mighty shades; and the Spaniard, still needy&#xD;
with all his treasures, looked out, on every hand, for empires&#xD;
which he must yet possess. He was sensible of the delicious lux-&#xD;
ury of his Cuban climate, but. did not yield to it his strength. That&#xD;
fierce, vigorous life which distinguished the Castilian character, at&#xD;
the period of the conquests of Spain in the new world,-to which&#xD;
was due such a wonderful constellation of great captains-Cortez,&#xD;
the Pizarros, Ojeda, Balboa, and a host besides-declared the&#xD;
energies of a people in their prime, with a startling mission of per..&#xD;
formance before them, demanding the equal exercise of the best&#xD;
genius and courage. The compound passion of avarice and ambi-&#xD;
tion left them in no humor for repose. Without pause, yet not&#xD;
blindly, they pursued their mission; and the impatient and fevered&#xD;
restlessness which it demanded and excited, rendered them supe-&#xD;
rior to every persuasion that threatened conflict with their&#xD;
strength. These could only prevail finally with the race which,&#xD;
with ample luxuries in possession, find no longer in their thirst&#xD;
the provocation to performance. For the present, no Spaniard&#xD;
can enjoythe sweets of Cuban airs with comparative safety. They&#xD;
have still a great work to do, are still goaded by fiery passions&#xD;
which will not suffer them? to sleep, and they seize their luxuries&#xD;
with the mood of the hurrying traveller, in a strange land, who&#xD;
plucks the flower along the wayside as he passes, and hastens on&#xD;

some necessities still goad, and where the door to pride~ and p0&#xD;

tiful in turn, all-linked together by assimilative beauties, and all&#xD;
blessing, singly and together,-all nevertheless fail.-perhaps,&#xD;
fortunately tken,-to supersede, in the minds of our Spaniards,&#xD;
the habitual desires of their hearts. Still, the heroic p~tgeant is&#xD;
in the ascendant; the human passion. The crowded spectacle,&#xD;
the strife of violent forces, the eager scene of human struggle and&#xD;
conquest, make them heedless of all that is simply sweet and&#xD;
lovely in their possession. Even women share the tastes with&#xD;
the passions of the sterner sex, and turn from their groves and&#xD;
gardens to the gory terrors of the bull-fight.&#xD;
But why chide ~ These people are simply the pioneers for&#xD;
other races, who shall more securely enjoy what they neglect&#xD;
and despise. They work in obedience to laws of nature, which&#xD;
regard rather the uses of men than their pleasures. One race&#xD;
but paves the way for another. We blaze the pathways for fu-&#xD;
ture generations, happy if they should be the children of our&#xD;
loins, for whom we win empire and clear the way. The Span-&#xD;
iards of the time of IDe Soto, in consequence of a fatal defect in&#xD;
their morals, did not always conquer the inheritance for their own&#xD;
children. But of this they did not dream! How should they ~&#xD;
Let us now return from our wanderings, and make generaliza-&#xD;
tion give place to detail.&#xD;
Following out his plan, for increasing the enthusiasm at once of&#xD;
his own followers, and of the people at large of the island of Cuba,&#xD;
Hernan de Soto was nowbusied with his preparations for thepublic&#xD;
sports which he had appointed, and with which he was to delight&#xD;
the fancies of the Cubans. It was good policy that he should do&#xD;
these things; for it must be remembered that he was not mere-&#xD;
ly Adelantado of Florida, and of its imaginary treasures and&#xD;
empires, but governor also of all Cuba; which beautiful and&#xD;
prolific island was to be left in charge of the Lady Isabella while&#xD;
he pursued his toils of conquests in the wild recesses of the&#xD;
Apalachian. He had designed his preparation on no ordinary&#xD;
scale of magnificence. Though reputed to be a close ~and avari.&#xD;
cious generalproverbiany so-he was yet fully aware that there&#xD;
are periods when it is necessary to be lavish and even profligate&#xD;

f expenditure. The objects which ha now propose4 to at&#xD;
stronglyy urged and fully justified a large departtn~e from&#xD;
~isual habits of economy. His wife, the noble L4dy Isal&#xD;
was, however, in some degree the prompter of th~s liber~&#xD;
~he was no common woman, but one born with a rincely&#xD;
~o whatever is noble in the regards of man, wheth r in th&#xD;
~ ernals or the substances of society and State. A enerou~&#xD;
ulse, at all times, made her anxious to satisfy the popular:&#xD;
ires-that is, wherever their cravings led them to e app:&#xD;
~ion of great deeds and graceful performance. He know]&#xD;
of the present ol~jects to b&amp;amp; attained by her lord frpm the&#xD;
mon sympathies~ increased, in considerable degree, the nati&#xD;
gracious and free affluence of her disposition. ~he ben&#xD;
mind to the object, and consulted with all round he the v~&#xD;
schemes by which to render the projected displ y one&#xD;
magnificence never before paralleled in Cuba; and thoug&#xD;
Adelantado groaned in secret over the excess o4 expen&#xD;
which naturally followed from her plans, he was ~et full:&#xD;
scious of the good policy by which they were dict ted; a:&#xD;
tastes readily acknowledged the beauty, skill and s lender&#xD;
promised to be the results of her exertions.&#xD;
The day was at hand, set aside for the common ement&#xD;
public sports, which had become official, and wer to last&#xD;
days. We are not to suppose that, because the hi her for&#xD;
chivalry were dying out in Europe-because, in act, the&#xD;
tuition no longer cherished there any of the nobler obje&#xD;
the order, and had sunk, from a social and politicainto S&#xD;
military machine,-that its' displays had becom~ less o&#xD;
tious or less attractive when attempted. On the contrary&#xD;
usually the case that, with the decay of an institution, its&#xD;
at external splendor, are apt' to be even greater than in t1&#xD;
of its most unquestioned ascendency; even as the fashi&#xD;

pageants, which seem, over all, to require the highest finish in&#xD;
art and the utmost polish in society-which seem, in fact, to&#xD;
belong only to an old civilization, such as that of Christian&#xD;
Europe,-it was ordinarily found that the ambition for display&#xD;
was more than commonly ostentatious and expensive. Certain&#xD;
it is,. that nothing of the sort in Spain, for a long time before, sur-&#xD;
passed the promise, whether as regards the taste or the splendor,&#xD;
of the great preparations which had been made by De Soto for&#xD;
his three days of tourney and feats of arms, in the infant city of&#xD;
havana. The lists, as our fair gossip, Donna Leonora de&#xD;
Tobar,. has already told us, were erected in the beautiful amphi-&#xD;
theatre just without the suburbs of the town. Here scaffolding&#xD;
had been raised for the spectators, running half way round the&#xD;
barriers, inclosing a portion of the area. These were to be&#xD;
draped with showy stuffs. On some slight elevations, along the&#xD;
opposite space, a ruder sort of scaffolding were reared for the&#xD;
common people. These, in those days, did not assume that what&#xD;
was given them in charity should be of a quality to compare&#xD;
with the best. There was yet a third distinction made in behalf'&#xD;
of the persons in power, and their friends-the persons of noble&#xD;
birth and high position. Their place was something higher than&#xD;
the others, built of better materials, and in more careful manner.&#xD;
In the centre was a gorgeous canopy, which might have served for&#xD;
a prince of The blood. It covered a raised seat, richly cushioned.&#xD;
This was designed for the Adelantado and his noble lady. His&#xD;
immediate friends and chiefs, and the ladies of his court, were&#xD;

were painted the arms of Spain, on a rich shield or escutcheon;&#xD;

h~d learned to fashion in a style superior to anything beheld&#xD;

signed for the sports, choice instruments poured forth peals&#xD;
the most gay and inspiring music. The plan of the festivities&#xD;
quired that the cool hours of the day only should b~ emplo&#xD;
for the 'more active exercises of the combatants. The heat of&#xD;
noonday sun in that ardent clime was, even at this early pe&#xD;
of the year-the close of April-too intense to render agreed&#xD;
any violent displays of agility, under heavy armor, for n~&#xD;
amusement . The first day was assigned to the yo~g kni&#xD;

THE GATHERING.&#xD;
&#xD;
185&#xD;
&#xD;
was to be not unworthy of the future conquests, in the country&#xD;
of the Apalachian. Very curious was the motley crowd that&#xD;
showed itself on all the streets and avenues leading to the great&#xD;
area of attraction. There were muleteers from the mountain;&#xD;
wandering tribes akin to the gipsies; retired soldiers; and half-&#xD;
savage groups, in which it was difficult to discern which race pre..&#xD;
dominated mqst, the white man, the red man, or the negro. They&#xD;
constituted a curious amalgam; each exhibiting some trait or&#xD;
characteristic, picturesque, wild, individual, such as Murillo&#xD;
would delight to paint-.such as would have risen into dignity&#xD;
under the brush of Rembrandt. Girls came bounding along&#xD;
with the castanets, by the side of mules on which sat tottering&#xD;
grandmothers; boys loitered with the crossbow, eager to pick&#xD;
up a real by shooting it down at twenty paces. Contrabandists&#xD;
showed open faces, as, on pack mules, they brought the Aguar-&#xD;
dieite for sale, in stone jugs, one on each side; its mouth open-&#xD;
ing from the bosom of a panier. The stately owner of a rich&#xD;
hacienda, where he marked his hundred calves each spring, rode&#xD;
on a brave barb by the side of his family, occupying a vehicle&#xD;
still in use, cumbrous but delightful of motion beyond all others,&#xD;
-the volant6. We must not stop to describe it. As at the&#xD;
present day in Old Spain, in the rural districts, nothing was more&#xD;
curious than the various costumes and characters exhibited by the&#xD;
appearance of the people from the country. Every department&#xD;
in the old country had its fitting representative, tenacious, in the&#xD;
new world, of all that distinguished his province in the old. The&#xD;
gay and vivacious Andalusian, ribanded at wrist and shoulder,&#xD;
breast and shoe ;-.--the confident and swaggering Biscayan; the&#xD;
dull native of Valencia; the haughty Catalan ;-you might&#xD;
mark them all at a glance. Groups wandered on together, the&#xD;
highways to the city being for hours never without its strollers.&#xD;
Old songs were to be heardas they wentfrom natural musicians;&#xD;
sad touches, oddly mingled with lively redondillas, and some-&#xD;
times, from some rude crowded, half soldier and half priest, or&#xD;
poet, you might hear extempore ballacle~ ~Ievoted to the deeds of&#xD;
arms of Cortez and Pizarro. Mules in strings came down with&#xD;

fruit to the great market; lines of vehicles of all ~rts, a]&#xD;
ing to the clamor. Sometimes, but rarely, the be gar he&#xD;
his cap for charity, and was laughed at as a cheat; for be&#xD;
in the new world must needs be so always. Th re was&#xD;
and fruit for all. Sometimes the beggar, however was a ~&#xD;
of the lowest class, who never asked for alms, b t got I&#xD;
for the doleful ditties, which no one stopped to hea. The:&#xD;
better music forward; and the crowds hurried on their&#xD;
But, to enumerate is impossible. Fancy the mo t pictu&#xD;
region of the world, filled with the most pictures ue of a&#xD;
pie, and the most contradictory; too proud for restrain&#xD;
with a curious conventional arrangement, which, making&#xD;
thing grave, admirably allowed of the minglingsof the gra&#xD;
the ridiculous ;-all at once thrown into disorder, under&#xD;
tions the most~exciting ;-all in highest state of emotion, ye&#xD;
the most amiable temper ;--happy in the moment, and pi&#xD;
to gather happiness from all possible sources.&#xD;
Already, at early dawn, the trumpets began to pour fori&#xD;
most lively fanfares. Already, a thousand cries of ho&#xD;
expectation arose from the gathering and rapidly inc&#xD;
groups. Some of the young champions were f3irc~ady&#xD;
ground, prepared for coursing, for shooting, fof runni&#xD;
spears at the ring, and with swords upon the Qu~ntam.&#xD;
were busy raising butts and preparing their shaft~ for th&#xD;
of archery. Some had chosen their rivals, in passages wit&#xD;
lance and muffled ra}~der. Jugglers and buffooi$s we~e&#xD;
groiind-tumblers began their antics, and, ever a~d anon&#xD;
burst of clamor #~om the crow4 announced some ~Aever ~&#xD;
ance, or the appearance of some favorite champ n.&#xD;
~occasionally rising into shouts, declared the motion&#xD;
wrought restlessly in the bosoms of the multitude, like the&#xD;
of the troubled sea heaving up in the glorious su shine.&#xD;

The lists were made sufficiently ample for the conflict&#xD;
as well as foot, and for the passages~at~arrns of se eral as&#xD;

many who aimed at sports of their own, and who found favorite&#xD;
spots upon the sides of the surrounding hills. Rules had been&#xD;
published, prescribing the various fbrhis of combat which were&#xD;
to be allowed within the lists, and the manner in which they were&#xD;
to be conducted. These were all to be pacific in character, how-&#xD;
ever deadly might be the weapons which the parties thought&#xD;
proper to employ. In the hands of tIW good knight, or squire, it&#xD;
was understood that the sharp spear, the sword, and the battle-&#xD;
axe, might be used with the noblest shows of skill and power, yet&#xD;
without hurt to life or limb. There were tilts appointed with the&#xD;
lance, and duels with the sword; contests of strength were to be&#xD;
tried with the mace and battle-axe, ~nd of dexterity with ~the&#xD;
dagger and the knife. But, in each case, the contest was inva.&#xD;
riablyto be decided, when one of the combatants should be put at&#xD;
such disadvantage as would place him at the mercy of his op-&#xD;
ponent, or render necessary for his relief a battle ~z l..'outrcznce.&#xD;
To compel respect to this regulation was not always easy when&#xD;
th~ pride of the champion was mortified, and his passions roused;&#xD;
but De Soto had reserved to himself a~ of right, to be the judge&#xD;
of the field, and his warder was Don Balthazar de Alvaro, a&#xD;
person no longer young, of grave aspect, of high authority, and&#xD;
quite learned, as well as experienced in the business of the to~ir~&#xD;
nament. It was reasonable to suppose, therefore, that a due re-&#xD;
gard to the regulations which had been published would be c~b-&#xD;
served among the combatants. Of these hereafter; we must pause&#xD;
for the present.&#xD;

CHIVALRY is only another name for enthusiasm. T&#xD;
never dies out in a community where the other may&#xD;

TIlE CROWP.                     189&#xD;
Havana swarmed with life. At an early hour of the mor~iing,&#xD;
as we have said.-nay, long, before the dawn-.the hum and buzz&#xD;
of preparation were to be heard in every quarter. The country&#xD;
had poured itself into the city; the city had suddenly take~ the&#xD;
voice and wing of liberty, such as the country usually enj ~ys.&#xD;
You might see, all night, the gleam upon the hill-sides of tor4~hes&#xD;
guiding the foQtsteps of long cavalcades Over all the routes f~om&#xD;
the interior. Knights, nobles, artisans, peasants and mdun-&#xD;
taineers, barriers and contrabandistas banished rogues, outlaKvs,&#xD;
returning in. disguise, and reckless of danger, in the passion wl~ich&#xD;
the tournament inspired; we have seen already how motley ~ind&#xD;
various were the groups. Crowds, fr6n~far and near, came on&#xD;
foot. A single mule sometimes confriVed to bring a family;&#xD;
the cart, the sedan, the volante, were all in requisition; and very&#xD;
picturesque and beautiful was it to see the long trains, seemii~g,&#xD;
for all the world, one great continuous procession, winding alopg&#xD;
the circuitous paths~; climbing suddenly 1~o the hill-top, streaming&#xD;
though the plain, and vaguely reap~earing~recognize~ 1y&#xD;
their torches only-in the deep dim ave~lues of the silent fore~Lt.&#xD;
After a group on foot, gay and rambling, would you see tl$e&#xD;
stately and swelling hidalgo, on. his great horse, showily capa]~i-&#xD;
soned in gaudy and costly garments. iN~oble ladies in their cai'-&#xD;
riages, of whatever sorts-sometimes in litters borne on tAe&#xD;
shoulders of the slender natives of the island.~followed und~r&#xD;
the guidance of the Don. At ~a respectful distance in the rea,&#xD;
came groups of peasants, and there, heedless of all, rambled foi~-&#xD;
ward a savagely bearded mountaineer upon a donkey, whos~&#xD;
horrid screams at intervals, causes the gorge of the knight to rise&#xD;
with the desire to punish the impertinence that dogs his heels s~&#xD;
closely with such a beast. But even the Baron grows indulgent&#xD;
with the spirit of the scene, and the m0unta~neer rides neare~L&#xD;
and nearer, without suffering from the wrath which, at anQthe1~&#xD;
time, his approach would most certainly f~rovoke.&#xD;
But day opens the mighty pageant, and the sun hurries up&#xD;
with his purple banner, to be present at t1~e scene. Fancy, now,&#xD;
the conflicting but mingling masses; the Picturesque and oddly&#xD;

the hum, the stir, the billowy swaying to and fro,~ with rc&#xD;
scream, and cry and hiss, and shout and 1augh-tha1~, howev&#xD;
ous, all fuse themselves together, as it were, intq~ one ur&#xD;
voice of hope and enjoyment. The hills surrounding the ami&#xD;
tre are already covered with tents and booths of reed, thatch&#xD;
straw; withvehicles of all sort; groups of nTiules and horses;&#xD;
for food, and fruit, and liquor; shows of mountebanks, am&#xD;
for the gamester. Gay st~eds are fastened, and watc&#xD;
livened pages, under clumps of palms affording shelter&#xD;
banners stream from every tent or lodge, assigned to&#xD;
and men-at-arms. These, raised as if by magic, during&#xD;
ceding night, occupied the more eligible vacant places con&#xD;
Each bears without the armorial insignia of the noble, wh&#xD;
held due warranty from the legitimate herald, or owed&#xD;
only to the persevering ambition of the pctrvern~, who s&#xD;
den the shelter of a gray antiquity, to hide the short f&#xD;

At intervals a sweet strain of music rises ~'rom a c&#xD;

DE SOTO'S &amp;amp;4TTQ.                  191&#xD;
The banner of' Castile and Leon is alPeady rollin~ out, wit~i its&#xD;
great, gorgeous and gold folds above it. Not so loftily raised,&#xD;
but yet so placed in the foreground a~ to attract all eyes, is~ the&#xD;
personal banner of De Soto: a sheet df azure, on which is parted&#xD;
a spirited picture of a cavalier, mounted on a fiery charger, toth&#xD;
armed to the teeth, and about to leap precipice. The picture il-&#xD;
lustrated one of the Adelantado's great eats in Peru. The m~tto&#xD;
is Italian, in gold letters~"pj~~~j pu ; eke a trionfar ti ~uic~o.'~&#xD;
When De Soto was asked by Don Balt~iazar why he put so pr~m-&#xD;
ising a motto in a foreign language, whi~h was known to so fe~ of&#xD;
his people, he answered." That it may 1~e more impressiv&amp;amp;pr the&#xD;
Adelentado Was something of a philosopher. Hardly Was the&#xD;
banner seen to wave than some one wa~ ready to translate for&#xD;
the curious multitude the mysterious pi'omise. When told that&#xD;
the gallant cavalier only swore in Itali 4n that he would conduct&#xD;
them to conquest, there was not a syllal~le of the inscription that&#xD;
was not gotten instantly by heart, and ~ht&#xD;
~a night it was sung as&#xD;
the burden of a refrain, by a native rhy~nester, who was conte~it&#xD;
to encourage the enterprise upon which-Lhe did not go himself!&#xD;
Next to the pavilion of De Soto, on tue right, was that of t~e&#xD;
Captain General, Don Porcallo de Figu~roa, his banner shining&#xD;
above it, gleaming with a sun of gold. Don Baithazar de Alvaro&#xD;
had his place on' the left of the Adelanta~fjo, whom he was to as-&#xD;
51st as warder or master of the tourney. We need not range the&#xD;
places of the rest, nor enumerate the good, the old, and the ip-&#xD;
iluential families, to whom conspicuous seats were assigned for&#xD;
the survey of the spectacle. Going without the barriers, we ap-&#xD;
proach the tents or pavilions of the knights who Were expected&#xD;
to engage in the several passages..at..ar~5 Here they were to&#xD;
dress and equip themselves; hither they were to retreat and rest&#xD;
when wearied, and take refreshment Each was sacred to its&#xD;
owner, and great care was taken by the pc~lice of the field that&#xD;
they were never trespassed upon by the crowd. In the rear&#xD;
of each pa~flion Was a tent or shelter of more common material,&#xD;
where the horse or horses of the cavalier were kept and groomed.&#xD;

Sc~me of the knights, as the wealthy Seijor Don Porc~&#xD;
Figueroa, for example, had a score of horses; but the&#xD;
number, like our poor knights of Portugal, 'had a singh&#xD;
only. But he was generally a good one, of great strong&#xD;
endurance, and admirably trained. We pass, in review, ~&#xD;
eral pavilions without the barriers, of the knights first men~&#xD;
of Nuno de Tobar, of~ Balthazar de Gallegos, of Juan d~&#xD;
lante, of Christopher de Spinola, and many others, each&#xD;
bears the especial shield and insignia of its proprietor. M~&#xD;
ple than all the rest, made of crimson cotton, were the t&#xD;
the Portuguese brothers. It was remarked by curious ob&#xD;
that these tents were no longer pitched side by side; the&#xD;
now opposite each other, one on the right, the other on&#xD;
of the centre. The banner which floated above the. pay&#xD;
Philip, bore the image of a ruined castle, from which&#xD;
had spread its wings and was away. That of Andres e&#xD;
a flight of meteors in a stormy sky. Both were significa&#xD;
shields of the several cavaliers hung each at the entrauc&#xD;
tent, and in a situation favorable for that atteint, or strol&#xD;
adversary's spearblunt'or sharp, which was the customary&#xD;
conveying the challenge. At the opening of the passage&#xD;
were transferred to conspicuous places within the area.&#xD;
none of the knights, challengers, or defenders, were to&#xD;
by the multitude. Squires, leading horses, or pages&#xD;
about' the tents, alone were visible. It remains to men&#xD;
that the torril, or pen for the bulls, was constructed bei&#xD;
tiers of seats assigned to the common. people. Fro&#xD;
closed passage, the door opening right upon the area,&#xD;
directly to the ring. In the rear of the torril, pavil~&#xD;
raised for the toreadores, picado2'es, chubs and matad&#xD;

Drums roll, trumpets sound ;-a wild burst of Saracenic in sic&#xD;
rises from the amphitheatre; and the crowds rush forward to eek&#xD;
their places. The Adelantado, at the head of a gorgeous ca al-&#xD;
cade of knights, rides into the ring- Already have the n ble&#xD;
ladies, with their several escorts, taken their seats upon the le-&#xD;
vated gallery which has been assigned them. The people re&#xD;
fast filling up the humbler places around the barriers. De S to,&#xD;
amidst fresh bursts of music, ascends to his chair of state, on&#xD;
Balthazar seats himself below him. Both carry truncheons. e&#xD;
signals are given; the sports begin. A troop of young squi es&#xD;
and pages are running at the ring. The old soldiers and ex e-&#xD;
rienced cavaliers look on with the natural interest f Vetera 5;&#xD;
curious to see who are to be their successors in arm and dist~ c~&#xD;
tion. The riding is very creditable; some instance particul&#xD;
ly graceful and spirited; though one or two hands e youth a e&#xD;
rolled over in the dust. The ring is borne off triumph ntly several&#xD;
times~; and this amusement ceases for a while. Then f llows ale~s~&#xD;

assault. The stroke of his pole leaves its mark behind it. It nclt&#xD;
unfrequently tumbles the assailant from his steed,~ aird thus&#xD;
creases the merriment of the spectators. In England, the QuiA-&#xD;

present occasion, the fresh black paint of his weapon is a more sen&#xD;

each of these performances there were, of course, champ&#xD;
be distinguished; prizes were accordingly delivered, and&#xD;
terest of the spectators was agreeably maintained to the&#xD;
But these were the mere preliminaries, the opening flour~&#xD;
the entertainment; pleasant enough while they lasted;&#xD;
provocative, nor calculated to appeal to those passions wili&#xD;
a people to their feet, and force them to cry aloud their&#xD;
tions, or their fears. The runners at the ring and Quintain,&#xD;
sports of the archers, were simply the prologues to the cr&#xD;
entertainment of the day,-this was the Bull-Fight--the&#xD;
sports to the Spaniard, one in which all classes delight,-&#xD;
appeals equally to the sympathies and tastes of nobles ar&#xD;
mons, of knights and ladies, and which, strange as it ~&#xD;
pear to us, is said in no degree to impair the sweetness, t~&#xD;
and gentleness of nature in the tender sex.&#xD;
A few words, on this subject. When we denounce the hv&#xD;
of a people, who relish such an amusement, we commit the&#xD;
error of placing our tastes in judgment upon theirs. T~&#xD;
is, that the question of humanity is really not involved&#xD;
the subject, even by our own standards. Our opinion&#xD;
superior to our humanity; and while society with us n~&#xD;
am even course, we are thus critical in respect to its&#xD;
Let events occur which disturb the habitual course of. thi:&#xD;
oar opinion gives way as readily to our passions as thai&#xD;
people, and our moral sinks as low as our humanity.&#xD;
very much the same, in all countries, as respects the ai&#xD;
and we have in our exercises, equivalent brutalities to&#xD;
any people in the world. A boxing match will appeE&#xD;
tastes of all of British blood as readily as bull-fight&#xD;
match to those of the Spaniard; and a cock-fight, when an'&#xD;
draws as large a crowd. We hunt the deer with a sp&#xD;
as murderous as that which the Andalusian knows whe&#xD;
scends into the bull-ring with lance and rapier; and w&#xD;
with ~ur dogs after the fox nightly, with a. pleasure tin&#xD;

inanities, when she reads of Gordon Cumming's horrible b~tch~&#xD;

eyes of pleasure, to behold his vieVim, ere his ~dying agonies are&#xD;
over. We take the fish by artful processes, so as to prolong his&#xD;
struggles, so that our delights shall be prQlonged also; and we&#xD;
call the angler, "Gentle Master Jzaak," while he details the ~ev&#xD;
eral arts by which a worm may he made to wriggle, and a tr~ut&#xD;
may be made to play, in pain. Our natui~a1ists assert with won-&#xD;
drous pains-taking, their Own humanity, while they transfix ~he&#xD;
living butterfly; and opinion, with us, sanctions with this defini-&#xD;
tion, the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent song-bird, and be~iu-&#xD;
tiful fly, and wondrous insect,* and curious reptile. Yet none of&#xD;
these sports, which include all the cruelties which belong to the&#xD;
Spanishi bull-fight, involve the nobler conditions with which tue&#xD;
man engages in the latter. In the bull fight he makes his m~n-&#xD;
hood one of the conditions on which he wages the conflict. Pe&#xD;
perils life upon his sport. lie does not claim the right to t4e&#xD;
and torture the life of the animal without giving the beast a&#xD;
chance in the conflict. The inhumanity in all these practices is&#xD;
pretty much the same; but much more may be said in favor ~f&#xD;
the bull-fight than of all the rest. The stakes of th~ opposing&#xD;
parties are equal in the game. Our opinion, in brief; is more&#xD;
humane than our humanity. The Englishman and the AmericaA,&#xD;
man or woman, who once witnesses a bull-fight, discovers th~t&#xD;
his tastes are superior in strength to his mOrals~.that his virtue~&#xD;
hold but little, sway in the encounter with his blood-that hi~&#xD;
opinion is unsustained by his resolutior~that his owit habits are&#xD;
not a whit more heedful of the claims of the beast, than th~&#xD;
Spaniard's. lie hunts one class, and the Spaniard another; and&#xD;
whether he hunts more virtuously than the Spaniard, must be hehi&#xD;

Qur purpose, however, in these remarks, is not to defen&#xD;
bull-fight as a legitimate o~ proper amusement of men.&#xD;
simply design to suggest to se1f~deception a little modest~&#xD;
to persuade cant to reconsider its pretensions. Humanit&#xD;
where, is equal to the encounter with temptation. Opinion,&#xD;
where, is superior to humanity; and thus it is that the mo~&#xD;
a community will be~superior to the sentiment in every mdi&#xD;
composing the community. Our opinion excuses our brut~&#xD;
while it lays bare those of another nation. So long as 1&#xD;

The bull-fight, as we have said, appeals equally to all&#xD;
tions, and to both. sexes, among the Spaniards. When the&#xD;
of the ring and the Quintain were over, and it was und&#xD;
that those which properly belonged to the amphitheatre ~&#xD;
begin, there was great increase among the au~Iience. The&#xD;

Alvaro, as Corregidor, or master of cereinonAes~..equivalen~ to&#xD;
"clear the field" "remove all obstructions from the ain~hi..&#xD;
theatre."&#xD;
There is sufficient reason for this order, which is always an un-&#xD;
gracious one in the ears of "the fancy," "the swell mob," who&#xD;
have generally taken possession of the ring. They leave it with&#xD;
reluctance. But, at the order of the C6rregidor, the splen~Iid&#xD;
body of infantry which De Soto had been training for the Flori-&#xD;
da expedition, marched in, tQ the sound of martial music, and,&#xD;
with horizontal lances, swiftly swept the circle. Their ino~ire~&#xD;
ments were rapid; but the intruders retired slowly, sin~i ly&#xD;
clearing the barriers, around which they continued to cling, a -&#xD;
ious to be nigh the scene; to see the 'ninutest movements; a d&#xD;
to take such part in the affair themselves as fortune would all w&#xD;
them ;-their delight being found in beating the bull with th ir&#xD;
sticks, or thrusting at him with iron-pointed staves, from t s&#xD;
safe entrenchment whenever hi~ course should bring him s&#xD;
ficiently nigh the barriers. This duty done, the infantry disa -&#xD;
peared as rapidly as those whom they had driven out. But the nAg&#xD;
was not left vacant, for a moment. Theirplaces were soon occupied&#xD;
by the Toreadores consisting of bands of Picadores, of Chulo~r&#xD;
Banderillero8 and Matadore&amp;amp;. These nowinove inprocessionare~d&#xD;
the area, showing themselves to the spectators ;---the Pica&#xD;
in the saddle, armed with lances. They wear short cloaks, th~&#xD;
sleeves of which are partly laid open and left loose. Their&#xD;
small.clothes are of leather, the legs coated with a sort of&#xD;
greaves of plate iron ;-shoes and stockings are concealed by&#xD;
white gaiters; and a flat, broad, round hat, well ribanded, com-&#xD;
pletes their costume, which is quite fanciful and jockey.like&#xD;
Not less so is that of men on foot, the Chulog, whose habits&#xD;
more costly, if not more imposing. Their silk vests are trimmed~&#xD;

in all-the footmen-about eighteen. This includes a cou&#xD;
matadores, or killers. With these comes a mediespada, o&#xD;
swordsman, who is not often wanted. The picadores, or Ia&#xD;
three in number, follow them on horseback, in the perform&#xD;
of the act of grace before the representative of the throne&#xD;
~The toreadores take their stations, and declare themsel&#xD;
readiness. First, you behold the picadores. These plant' I&#xD;
~selves on one side of the gate from whence the bull is to e&#xD;
and at a distance of twenty-five or thirty paces. Those o&#xD;
armed with their short javelins, called banderillos, meant t&#xD;
and torture the bull, and for their defence, their cloaks o&#xD;
and scarlet, take their places also, ready to assist the pic.&#xD;
but along the barriers. A trumpet sounds; an Algua&#xD;
vanes, and receives from Don Balthazar the key of~the&#xD;
or den of the bull. The Adelantado waves his gilded trun&#xD;

moment confounds him. He looks up; around; star~&#xD;

with fire; his neck and shoulders streaming with blood* his head&#xD;
to the ground, as if with a heretofore~unknown feeling of humi~ity.&#xD;
But do you think that h~is humbled? No! He is only roused,&#xD;
* -only contracting himself to spring; gathering his muscles into&#xD;

He is right. "El Mo~'o" is a hero, and has sense as well as&#xD;
strength. He has felt his enemy; he begins to know him.&#xD;
picadores understand hinci better than the mob. They note is&#xD;
immense frame,-the great head,-the enormous breadth ~of&#xD;
neck,~the huge breast, life a rampart, which he spreads before&#xD;
them; the wonderful compactness of his whole figure. They ~ee&#xD;
the lurking devil in his dilating eyes, looking up, though his&#xD;
horns seem directed only to the ground. They note other signs&#xD;
which escape the populace, and they prepare themselves, with&#xD;
all their address, for a second assault. Their horses, which have~&#xD;
heard the roar of the bull, are treinblingbeneath them. They&#xD;
do not see the animal, as they have been blinded, th~ better to&#xD;
make them submit to the rein; but they feel their terrors the&#xD;

They tremble, but they obey. The picador, meanwhile, c&#xD;
his well-chosen lance beneath his right arm. He keeps a&#xD;
eye upon his enemy. He' knows that he is to be expect&#xD;
that he must come ;-that the struggle has not well begu&#xD;
that it will require his utmost skill to conquer-and es&#xD;
He does nOt mistake the ominous* aspect in the sign of Ta 1&#xD;
He has not read the Zodiac of the amphitheatre in vain.&#xD;
are all old stagers, these picadores. Each has a reputati&#xD;

names ~have been cried aloud, already, by more than a hu&#xD;

"Bravo! little Juan !" "Bravo! Francisco Dias !" "&#xD;

containing the name of his breeder.&#xD;
"Which of you ha~ a mistress with eyes worthy of a d&#xD;
Bravo! good fellows!' Let us see&#xD;
The allusion, here, is to the practice of the picador,&#xD;

heart. This is a great point gained; and a difficult one.&#xD;

terminating in knobs, with .which every rascal of the crowc~ goes&#xD;
properly armed to the circus. Their auxiliary assaults, in fact,&#xD;
are legitimate, and co~1stitute a fair part of the exhibition.&#xD;
They contribute greatly to goad a timid animal to the necessary&#xD;
degree of desperation, work him up to madness; when, no&#xD;
longer dreading the prick of the lance, though it buries itself an&#xD;
inch deep in the flesh, he plunges headlong upon his enemies,&#xD;
not to be again baffled in the assault, not to be turned aside;&#xD;
and throwing all his brute force into one concentrated effort, puts&#xD;
the picadores to all their arts for safety.&#xD;
"El Moro" is a bull of blood. He is a bull of discretion&#xD;
also. He has only paused to meditate in what manner to use&#xD;
his force against the skill of his enemies. He has concluded his&#xD;
plans; and, with a terrible snort, which ends in a i~'oar, he rushes&#xD;
again upon the picaclores. They meet him handsomely, their&#xD;
horses' heads a little turned on one side, their spears delivered&#xD;
dexterously, piercing the neck and shoulders of the beast. This&#xD;
is no pleasant* sort of salutation. It is apt to turn off ten bulls&#xD;
in the dozen. They all remember, with keep se~sibiities, the&#xD;
garrocka, or goad, by~ which the herdsmen have initiated them in&#xD;
the lessons of obedience. "El Moro" has not lost his sensibili-&#xD;
ties, or his memories; but "El Moro ' has a prescience which&#xD;
tells him that he is doomed; and that to feel the pricks too&#xD;
keenly now, is only to prolong his tortures. He, accordingly,&#xD;
,resolves to "come up to the scratch" valiantly. Skulking, he&#xD;
perceives, will avail him nothing. He must die, and he will ~not&#xD;
die feebly. The spear-point is in his neck deep, deep; and the&#xD;
blood spirts high, and crimsons his great swart breast and shoul-&#xD;
ders. But he resolves not to feel his hurts. He does not&#xD;
swerve: he plunges headlong forward; head downward; horns&#xD;
.tossing and tail erect, and shaking to and fro like that .of the lion&#xD;
in his bound, or the serpent in his coil.&#xD;
"Bravo toro! Bravo El Mioro I" is the delighted roar of the&#xD;
multitude, as they witness his spirit. The horsemen turn about&#xD;
like 'lightning; the first darts aside, with excellent skill, and sweeps&#xD;
out of the track.&#xD;

"Bravo, Pepe 1" cry the mob, as .they witness this dexter y of&#xD;
the first of the picadores; but the bull sweeps on; he rec ives&#xD;
the spear-point of the second of his foes; but his own irresi tible&#xD;
rush, his own headlong bulk, prevents his recoil now, even 'f his&#xD;
spirit quailed beneath the wound: but it does not. Th pi-&#xD;
cador tries to wheel and escape his assault, but too late: the&#xD;
horns of "El IMloro" .are already buried in the flank of the s eed;&#xD;
he rends his sides, snaps the defensive ribs like glass; stee and&#xD;
rider roll over upon the plain, the latter upon the off-side o the&#xD;
animal. The body of the horse constitutes his rampart or a&#xD;
moment. It is a fearful moment. Life and death hang n it.&#xD;
An awful hush envelops the amphitheatre; women s riek,&#xD;
men shout an~,d swear; heads peer over each othcr; eye are&#xD;
starting almost from their sockets; anxiety and appetite, fe r and&#xD;
hope, horror and delight, are in wondrous strife in the m ltitu-&#xD;
dinous soul of the assembly. IE~rery body looks to see th bull&#xD;
dash down upon the prostrate horse and ridex. The latte lies&#xD;
close and quiet, expecting the assault: his hope of escape is in&#xD;
his insignificLtnce. But "El Moro" is a bull of inagnanimi y--a&#xD;
heroic bull, worthy of the fierce and fearless race after* horn&#xD;
they have named him. He disdains to touch the fallen ctini.&#xD;
He spurns the sands.~anew; he dashes after the remaining pica-&#xD;
dores, who course round the amphitheatre, dexterously avoid~ g his&#xD;
charge, and seeking to double upon and wound him anew t ev-~&#xD;
ery chance. Wonderful is the skill they exhibit, and great is the&#xD;
cheering which they receive. Both bull and picador rece ye it&#xD;
equally; nothing can be more fair than the applause; it is e ually&#xD;
merited: and gratitude for the sport alone requires that merit&#xD;
should be equally acknowledged. "Bravo toro I" "Bravo Pica-&#xD;
dor I" "Bravo Little Juan I" "Bravo Moro!', These and sirni-&#xD;
lar cries are heard from all quarters of the ring.&#xD;
But "El Moro" is not content to share his fame with thers,&#xD;
-he is greedy of glory. Another picador is overthrown; horse&#xD;
and man roll on the earth. Little Juan, who won the ravos&#xD;
lately, is scrambling over the barriers, partly assisted n the&#xD;
effort by the black brows of the bull himself-his hornsjus miss-&#xD;
&#xD;
202&#xD;
&#xD;
ing the haunches of the horseman, and grazing the barriers. It&#xD;
was a narrow escape. The horse of the picador flies wild, with&#xD;
his entrails hanging from a horrid wound in the belly. The bull&#xD;

mal anew. Both are covered with blood. '%Mira I" c4es the&#xD;
"fancy "-the "swell mob" from the corridor,-." Mira! que bel&#xD;
cuerpo de .9angre!" "See! see! what a beauteous body of blood !"&#xD;
Thus goring as he goes, himself covered with gore, snorting&#xD;
with fury, his eyes like red fires, flashing in flight, his moi4h full&#xD;
of foam and blood, his head tossing wildly, the blood and lather&#xD;
covering his whole body, the bull keeps on his way of terror,&#xD;
ripping and rending the wounded and agonized horse, until, with&#xD;
a terrific roar and effort, he fairly lifts the victim from the ~arth,&#xD;
dashes him down upon the sands, an strikes his hoofs on his neck,&#xD;
as he bounds over him in pursuit of the remaining picador~&#xD;
There is no parleying with so headstrong a brute as that. There.&#xD;
is no baffling him.. He is not to be deluded of his proper prey.&#xD;
He is not the fool to put nose to the ground, as ordinary bulls&#xD;
d6, wasti g his fury upon the enemies he has already over-.&#xD;
thrown. e fallen horse or horseman attracts none of his atten-&#xD;
tion. He sees and seeks him only who is on foot, in motion;&#xD;
and he gi es the surviving picador no respite. Never was&#xD;
bull 50 de ermined, and so sensible, lie is not merely a hero,&#xD;
he is a ge eral; and the audience is duly sensible of his woiider-&#xD;
ful merits. They shout their vivas on every hand. "Lon~*v live&#xD;
El 2ifioro!' he whom they have yet resolved shaLl die that very&#xD;
day. "B avo toro! Bravo Moor !" They toss their hands aloft;&#xD;
they fling p their caps; porros and chivatas thundc~r their ap-&#xD;
plauses ag inst the barriers. "El Moro" seems aware of their&#xD;
applause, a d resolute still better to deserve it. He gives the&#xD;
picador no moment of delay. lie is upon him. The steed&#xD;
doubles With wondrous dexterity, and eludes the shock; and he&#xD;
flow receives the vivas. But the bull is almost equally alert.&#xD;
His evolutions are as sudden as his rage is high. He wheels,-.&#xD;
another bound~ the lance of the picador but grazes him; the&#xD;
horse darts, away, but the bull is at ~his haunches, and rends him&#xD;

-a terrible gash-ia the rear. Bleeding and torn, the s ced&#xD;
staggers forward, when a new thrust sends him over, and the r der&#xD;
flings himself off on ~the opposite side, to escape the invite ate&#xD;
assailant. It is a moment of extreme peril; every soul is hu lied&#xD;
* almost to stifling in the assembly; and now the chubs with t eir&#xD;
gaudy cloaks come fluttering upon the scene~ They are to li ert&#xD;
the bull from his victim. They glide between, almost like sh4j~s&#xD;
of air. The red shawls flare before the eyes of El Moro. ut&#xD;
El Moro is none of your common bulls. He is not to be er-&#xD;
suaded that the shawl can work him injury. He has no vu gar&#xD;
bull-hostility to crimson. He darts at the chub, and not his sh wi.&#xD;
The banderillo flies-a little dart, ornamented with colored and&#xD;
gilded paper-and sticks into his neck. Another is planted di-&#xD;
rectly opposite, buried deeply in the flesh. A third, a fo rth,&#xD;
until the beast is fairly covered with these proofs of tho de ter-&#xD;
ity of his new assailants, who trip along like dancing-masters&#xD;
abont the scene; relying upon their wonderful agility to art&#xD;
aside from his wild and passionate plunges. They scatter a his&#xD;
approach. He drives them to the barriers, over which the res-&#xD;
cued picador has just clambered with a show of pain and la or,&#xD;
that proves he has not gone through the fray unscathed. T ere&#xD;
Is a rent in his leather breeches; there is an exceedingly sore p ace&#xD;
beneath it. But the chubs are dispersed,-El Moro remains the&#xD;
lord of the arena. He stamps as if for a new enemy; he r ars&#xD;
as if. in triumph! He darts, seeing no moving object, at t 050&#xD;
which lie still or writhing upon the plain. He tramples the ay&#xD;
mantles; he rends the prostrate and still struggling horse. Ho&#xD;
Is impatient that they offer no resistance; for the goads still ear&#xD;
his neck and sides, and the wounds are a ceaseless torture. he&#xD;
amphitheatre rings with applause of his, prowess; but this ub-&#xD;
sides, and the appetite of the multitude craves a renewal of the&#xD;
excitement.&#xD;
"Caballos! Cabaflos al toro!" is the cry. More horses are&#xD;
required for the bull. New, champions appear upon the sc~ne;&#xD;
and the battle is renewed. ~3ut we must not enter now u~on&#xD;
details; "El Moro" maintains his reputation. Another hor~e is&#xD;

slain-a other wounded-two riders are hurt with broken ribs,&#xD;
and the c ubos again scatter themselves over the area for the res-&#xD;
cue of th third. "El Moro" scatters them in turn: but he is&#xD;
exhaust by his victories. Covered with wounds, he staggers in&#xD;
the centr of the ring. His eye grows filmy, his head droops,&#xD;
his tail- ut he is thus far the conqueror, and there is a moment&#xD;
of silent admiration in tribute to his prowess. But the signs&#xD;
show that he can make no more sport. He has done all that bull&#xD;
could do or the popular holiday; and nothing remains but to&#xD;
administer the coup de grace, and bring on his successors. The&#xD;
trumpet s unds. The matador-the killer-appears alone upon&#xD;
the scene. On his appearance, with lifted cap, he make his 6bei-&#xD;
sance to t e Adelantado. In his right hand he holds a long toledo&#xD;
-a beauty ul rapier, of the best temper-in his left hand he waves&#xD;
a little red flag, not much larger than a handkerchief; called the&#xD;
muleta. e receives the permission which he requires. . "El&#xD;
Moro's" eath-warrant is given out.&#xD;
The mat dor exhibits the grace of a posture-master, with all&#xD;
the coolness of the executioner. He turns towards the victim,&#xD;
and advance s slowly. He is pale; looks anxious; is evidently&#xD;
wary. W 11 he may be. Such an adversary, showing as much&#xD;
cunning as courage, is not often to be met. The matador stops,&#xD;
and with al the coolness of which he is capable, surveys the foe.&#xD;
He is a jud e of character, and bulls have a character that re-&#xD;
quires to b studied. Antonio Pico also has a character at stake.&#xD;
He is greatly renowned among the Cubans. He has slain his&#xD;
hundreds, a d he must show himself worthy of his renown. His&#xD;
movements ere at once graceful and decided; and, his thrusts&#xD;
were as swi as dexterous. He was the master of his art.&#xD;
sometimes, t e master fails, and Pico was now evidently cautious.&#xD;
It is a duel hich he is about to fight. The bull is still danger-&#xD;
ous-his rag is still deadly. He has lost- his energy, but not&#xD;
his malice. ico has no shield, nothing but the muleta, and his&#xD;
beautiful ra ier. His ball dress of silk, satin and ribbon, is at&#xD;
strange varia ce with the duty to be done; but that is one of the&#xD;
charming Pea ures of the performance. He commands himself;&#xD;

&#xD;
restrains himself; a thousand eyes are upon him; he knots it,&#xD;
but he sees nothing but the eyes of the bull. Their tame, f lmY&#xD;
expression does not deceive him. He fancies that "El M9ro&#xD;
understands the whole proceeding, what is to be done, and ~hat&#xD;
is to ~be feared; and tihat he is preparing himself with more ~han&#xD;
hull subtlety, to make a fearful fight of it. It must be sub1~lety&#xD;
now, opposed to subtlety ;-the wisdom of the man to the excit-&#xD;
ed instincts of the beast. The expectation is, that the bull will&#xD;
run at the red flag; when the matador will receive him at the&#xD;
point of the weapon, which pierces him between the shoulder and&#xD;
the~ bone blade. If the bull has much spirit left, he will d6 this.&#xD;
The presumption is, if he will not, that he succumbs to his fate-&#xD;
that his energies are exhausted.&#xD;
Pico waves his muleta in front of the animal. "El Moro"&#xD;
makes a single charge, but recoils--stops short, and stands with&#xD;
head down, as if in waiting. A shout of contempt, from the&#xD;
"fancy," assails him for this ignoble conduct. It encourages Pi-&#xD;
co. He advances, waves the flag anew; again the bull charges;&#xD;
the steel flashes, quick as lightning ;-strikes ;-strikes ;-all see;-&#xD;
but it is an awkward stroke! Pico's nerves have been troubled.&#xD;
The steel strikes the bone ;-it flies from the hand of the matador;&#xD;
and, with a roar, the recovering bull is upon him, with a dreadful&#xD;
guiding sweep. The brave fellow darts aside, but not unhurt.&#xD;
He staggers,-he makes for the barriers: the cunning "El&#xD;
Moro," with brightening eye, surges after him. The suspense is&#xD;
awful; the women scream; the men shout; the matador staggers&#xD;
forward to the barriers; falls, without catching them; and, but a&#xD;
moment-remains for escape! a terrible anxiety prevails. In that&#xD;
moment, a gigantic form leaps over the barriers from the corri-&#xD;
dor, He is dark like the red man. He is of that ra~~e~ mixed&#xD;
with the white and the negro,-a most unnatural and atrocious&#xD;
combination. But what he is, no one as yet can distinguish.&#xD;
They see nothing clearly. They only know that he stands be-&#xD;
tween the fallen P~co - and the charging El Moro. They see a&#xD;
common red ker~hief waving in one hand. They see not&#xD;
the short, sharp ki~ife in the other. They see, however, that he&#xD;

shouts. The sound~ and clamors from the spacious area were&#xD;
echoed back from ~all the little hills around. They were all in&#xD;
motion at ~the music, and clapping th~Ar hands with joy. Soon,&#xD;
the fierce bray of lihe trumpet was heard mingling wildly with&#xD;
sweetei' music. '~on came the roll of the drum; and steeds&#xD;
neighed, and squires shouted, and the mountain peasant began&#xD;
i~o sing, in his exulting unconsciousness, the rude ballads of his&#xD;
distant forests. TIi~ere was shouting and clamor on every side;&#xD;
~and the rushing o~ crowds, and the din of conflicting sounds,&#xD;
might have led the unadvised spectator to suppose that chaos&#xD;
had come again, sc~ extreme was the confusion. But in all this&#xD;
confusion the truncheon of command prevailed. So well had&#xD;
everything been organized by Don Balthazar de Alvaro, and so&#xD;
native were such exercises to the multitude, that no conflict or&#xD;
disorder followed, where all things appeared to promise nothing&#xD;
less. The people knew their places; the officials their business.&#xD;
The heralds, and pi~rsuivants, and alguazils were all in sufficient&#xD;
number and sufficiently active. But, where the popular consent&#xD;
is with the given purpose, it is surprising how multitudes work&#xD;
together to the common end. The officers skirted the harriers&#xD;
within as well as without, and kept them free from encroach-&#xD;
ment; and, gradually, the throngs, pressing forward like crowd.&#xD;
ing billows of the sea, subsided calmly into their places along&#xD;
the galleries. The seats were filled as if by magic. The family&#xD;
groups, or special j~arties, each unobstructed in its wish to keep&#xD;
together, formed so many little domestic circles along the im-&#xD;
mensely crowded jiers; and the hum and buzz of conversation,&#xD;
free and unembarrassed as in private homes, went on. The&#xD;
merry laugh, and the smart jest, and the careless comment, were&#xD;
uttered aloud, as 4f none but friendly hearers were at hand to&#xD;
listen. It is a common error that the Spaniard is inflexible as&#xD;
well as proud. This is only true of a high state of. convention&#xD;
in the old comnwnities. In the new world, where all were&#xD;
adventurers, even nobility threw off some of its reserves, and&#xD;
accommodated itself to a more democratic condition of things ;-&#xD;

a result, Indeed, inevitable from the necessities of the region. But&#xD;
to our pr~gress.&#xD;
Suddei~ly, the bands struck up the national air, and thi~ was&#xD;
the signal for the approach and entrance of the Adelantado, the&#xD;
noble knights and ladies who immediately attended ~him and&#xD;
his lovely rife, and such favorites as Were specially invited to the&#xD;
more eley ted platform which was assigned to the represent~&#xD;
tive of majesty. This platform, it may be well to state, though&#xD;
elevated above the lower ranges of the seats assigned to the mul-&#xD;
titude, wa~ yet somewhat nearer to the circus. It was immedi:&#xD;
ately above the corridor, which, in all other parts of the area,&#xD;
was uncovered. Indeed, it seemed to hang almost Over the lists,&#xD;
and was not so high but that it might be easily touched by a&#xD;
lance in the hands of a knight on horseback. Along this platform,&#xD;
and in the foreground, on well and richly cushioned seats, the&#xD;
ladies were seated, 0C91.lpying preferred places; the gallants in&#xD;
attendance taking position in the rear. In the centre of this&#xD;
former range, sate Don Balthazar de Alvaro, acting as warder;&#xD;
and immediately behind, but on a dais above him, occupying a&#xD;
richly garmented fauteui4 sate the Adelantado and his lady.&#xD;
With the entrance of the two last, the viva3 became wilder than&#xD;
the music, and De Soto bowed impressively and gracefully, to&#xD;
the popular applause. His noble form and princely carriage, the&#xD;
splendor of his costume, and a proper regard to the immense&#xD;
amount of patronage which he had brought to the island, made&#xD;
him a wonderful favorite. Nor was his noble wife less so. She&#xD;
had virtues, indeed, superior to his, though of a less showy char-&#xD;
acter; and her personal beauty, her noble carriages the richness&#xD;
and exquisite taste of her dress, the equal. grace and dignity of&#xD;
her bearing, served to make her an object of like and equal at.~&#xD;
traction with her lord. They took their seats, and the example&#xD;
Was followed by those who accompanied them. When the&#xD;
places were all filled, the spectacle was one of wonderful bril~&#xD;
liancy and beauty. ,The seats were SO constructed as to showy&#xD;
most of the persons of those who occupied the front, and, these&#xD;
Were all naturally solicitous to appear in their richest habits,&#xD;

Olivia de Alvaro o~~cupied one of these foremost seats, near her&#xD;
uncle, and a little below, but quite close to, the Lady babella.&#xD;
She too was splend~dly habited; but she was perhaps the least&#xD;
conscious of' the fact of all in that as'~embly. She had made&#xD;
her toilet with little heart for it, and little heed to appearances.&#xD;
Her thoughts were of the saddest; and 'her face now was pale&#xD;
as death. There was a brightness, however, in her eye, of sin-&#xD;
gular wildness, and occasionally it flashed out with a vivid and&#xD;
peculiar intelligence. But she seldom trusted herself to gaze&#xD;
about the amphitheatre. She seemed to dread the encounter&#xD;
with other eyes. Beside her sate the frail, fair beauty, the wife&#xD;
of Nuno de Tobar, whose little tongue kept up a surprising dis-&#xD;
charge of small arms, without intermission. He~ supply of&#xD;
missiles seemed inexhaustible, and as they were mostly addressed&#xD;
to the ears of Olivia itis not a matter of wonder if she had nothing&#xD;
to say in return. ~The lack of opportunity, indeed, was rather&#xD;
grateful than otherwise. It saved her from all necessity of find-&#xD;
ing apologies for her\ taciturnity. Behind Olivia stood the pro.&#xD;
vincial courtier, Don Augustin de Sinolar, redolent of perfume,&#xD;
and diffuse and gay in silks and glitter. There were other gal-&#xD;
lants in waiting: but we must not stop to enumerate. The&#xD;
anxiety of the multitude has brought them to that .hush of ex-&#xD;
pectation which, e'~en more than militaryy authority, is the best&#xD;
security for order. Th~ Adelantado, like every good actor, well&#xD;
understood the impropriety of keeping the stage waiting. He&#xD;
rose gracefully and waved his truncheon. At the signal, a sud-&#xD;
den blare from the trumpets, at the entrance, quickened the pul-&#xD;
sation in every bo~om. The blast was' answered from a dozen&#xD;
quarters all around, the response from the tents of the challengers&#xD;
to the signal which required them to appear. But a few mo-&#xD;
ments more elapsed when the trumpets within and without&#xD;
pealed in unison ~ a lively and prolonged strain of wild and&#xD;
chee~fal music; and then was heard the heavy trappings of am&#xD;
~ proa~hing horse.&#xD;
" '~?hey come! They come !" was the involuntary cry from a&#xD;
thousand lately stifled voices. Then the heralds and pursuivants&#xD;
&#xD;

slowly cantered into the lists, skirting closely the barriers; and&#xD;
when expectation was at the highest, the challengers, six in num..&#xD;
ber, made their appearance. And, truth to speak, they showed&#xD;
themselvc~sright comely chevalier to the eye, and seemed well&#xD;
able to C rry themselves bravely and keep manfully the field.&#xD;
They wer headed, as was fitting, by the Lieutenant General of&#xD;
the army, the stout and wealthy Ilidalgo, Don Vasco Porcallos&#xD;
de Figuer a. This cavalier, whatever may have been his per-&#xD;
sonal mer ts, was perhaps rather more indebted to hi&amp;amp;~wealth&#xD;
for the di tinction he enjoyed, than to his genius as a soldier.&#xD;
We do no know that, up to this period, he had ever made any&#xD;
remarkable figure in arms. He certainly had, thus far, taken no&#xD;
such place in the popular imagination as was assigned to sundry&#xD;
of their famous men, who had proved even unfortunate~such as&#xD;
Alonzo de Ojeda, and many others. But wealth, with frequent&#xD;
largesse, a right generous spirit, and a gracious carriage, .will&#xD;
work wonders towards achieving temporary distinction. The&#xD;
reader may not have forgotten the policy of the Adelantado, already&#xD;

Nuno de Tobar, from the office which *he subsequently conferred&#xD;
on Vasco de Porc lbs. W~ are not prepared to say that he re-&#xD;
joiced in the prete t which enabled him to do so. But, i1 was&#xD;
one certainly whic he did not greatly regret. He was not dis-&#xD;
pleased at having he means wherewith to buy the favors of the&#xD;
rich cavalier. An Vasco Por~allos did not defraudd expectation.&#xD;
lie did not withho d his treasures from the expedition to Florida.&#xD;
His castellanos wer freely rendered to tl~e wants of his superior,&#xD;
with whose ambiti us views no man oP the army seemed so&#xD;
deeply to sympathy e. Vasco Porcallos was seized with a new-&#xD;
born desire for fa e, without foregoing a jot of ~his old passion&#xD;
for acquisition. H was anxious to be known, hereafter, as one&#xD;
of the conquerors t Florida; and, at the same time, he made&#xD;
sundry ~shrewd cal ulations of the profit which would ensue&#xD;
from his landed e tates in Cuba, by concentrating upon then~&#xD;
the labor of the palachian savages whom he expected to&#xD;
make captive in h s progress. The two passions, glory and&#xD;

gain,' strove equally together in his bosom; and, with such rare&#xD;
harmony, that neitl~er could be said to be, at any time, in the as-&#xD;
cendant. Vasco Porcallos was of a brave temper; and, though&#xD;
never distinguished in war, as a captain, had yet e~ijoyed consid-&#xD;
erable experience in the new world's conquests. Had he been&#xD;
a few years younger, he might still have hoped great things from&#xD;
his gallant spirit and generous ambition: But our cavalier was&#xD;
oi~i the wrong side of fifty, and few soldiers have ever acquired&#xD;
reputation, or achieved successes in foreign invasion, after they&#xD;
have passed the meridian line of life. It may be reasonably&#xD;
doubted, if his prudence was at all conspicuous in his engaging&#xD;
in a long and hazardQus expe~lition. That he would endure well&#xD;
enough the toils of a single campaign , was not questioned even&#xD;
among those who were jealous of his wealth and great appoiiit-&#xD;
ments; and still l9ss was it doubted that he would carry himself&#xD;
well in such passages of arms as it should fortune him to en-&#xD;
* counter. He was acknowledged to b&amp;amp; a good lance and ~a prop-&#xD;
er horseman, and as now he appeared iivthe amphitheatre, portly&#xD;
o( figure, tall, erect, covered with shining armor, riding a splendid&#xD;
bay, whose form ~nd color were equally free of blemish-for&#xD;
the white spot, of crescent shape, conspicuous in the centre of&#xD;
the horse's forehead, was held to be a beauty and not a blemish&#xD;
-the loud shout of applause which welcomed him, seemed to&#xD;
give assurance of the 'popular confidence in his prowess. His&#xD;
steed was gayly caparisoned with his master's favorite colors,&#xD;
green and gold, and his ~own bearing seemed to exhibit a full con-&#xD;
sciousness of the distinction he enjoyed, in carrying so brave a&#xD;
rider. The portly knight bestrode him with an air and spirit&#xD;
worthy of so gallant an animal; and, as he pricked him forward&#xD;
with the formidable Spanish rowel and made him caracole to the&#xD;
balcony, where sate the Adelantado and his noble companions of&#xD;
the fair sex, the populace, again shouted their unsuppressible&#xD;
admiration. Vasco Porcallos wore a brilliant armor, which be~&#xD;
trayed never a stains of the soil. A rich surcoat of green silk&#xD;
(afterwards thrown dif) hung somewhat loosely above his armor,&#xD;
whieh was of polished steel, fretted in figures of gold and silver,&#xD;
&#xD;
]3A.LTIIAZAR DE GALLEGOS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
vines and flower appearing in the sort of jeweler's work which'&#xD;
is known as van gated gold. ,His helmet was of like material&#xD;
and ornament, su mounted with a bunch of beautiful and costly&#xD;
plumes of the he on. The small shield which he carried lightly&#xD;
upon his left arm was of steel also, inlaid with a circular bor-&#xD;
dering of gold, 0 vines and flowers, in the centre of which,&#xD;
splendidly illumin ted, was the armorial ensign of the knight-&#xD;
a bright, keen eye looking out from a sun of blazing gold. The&#xD;
arrogant motto s oke sufficiently for the insolent ambition of&#xD;
the cavalier. 8 mio lo que veo !"-(" That is mine which I&#xD;
se&amp;amp; !") But this confidence vexed no self-esteem in all the&#xD;
assembly. It was but the embodiment of the national conceit,&#xD;
and it was perha s warranted by the fact. They had made&#xD;
their own all that hey had seen. It was an encouragement to&#xD;
valor and ~enterprise, that the nation should thus believe, that&#xD;
there was nothing, in reserve, which its warriors could not, in&#xD;
like manner, mak their own. The faith makes the victory.&#xD;
Vasco Porcallos, k own by his largesse much more than by his&#xD;
valor, was readily assumed to possess a spirit and capacity&#xD;
worthy of his bou ty; and his 'graceful obeisance before the&#xD;
dai8 upon which H man de Soto sate, was congratulated by the&#xD;
repeated viva8 of th multitude, and acknowledged by the gracious&#xD;
smile and courtesy f the Adelantado. Backing his steed with&#xD;
an elegant and mea ured, yet free motion, Don Vasco gave way&#xD;
to his brother chall ngers to come forward.&#xD;
He was followed by Balthazar de Gallegos, a stout and gal-&#xD;
lant adventurer; w o, without being quite so matured by time&#xD;
as Vasco Porcallos, ad, perhaps, seen quite as much service in&#xD;
Indian warfare. Hi carriage was good, and his skill and grace&#xD;
in managing his stee were quite equal to those of his predeces~&#xD;
sor; but there was lamentable disparity in their equipment.&#xD;
The horse was a fine one, big-limbed, yet of lively motion; but&#xD;
his furniture was rus y; and the armor of the rider was distin-&#xD;
guished equally by he antiquity of its appearance, and the&#xD;
numerous dints of ba tle which it showed. E~ven the slight dec.-&#xD;
orations which Balth am de Gallegos employed in honor of the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
occasion,-consisting of gaudy scarf and various colored shoulder&#xD;
knots and ribbons, served rather to expose than to relieve the&#xD;
defects and decayed places in his rusty harness. His shield was&#xD;
large and cumbrous, but carried lightly on his muscular arm.&#xD;
It was of a faded blue ground, on which was painted a volcanic&#xD;
mountain in eruption, the jets of fire ascending without falling-&#xD;
the motto indicative of a thoroughly Spanish ambition-" Mias&#xD;
bjen consumir que no exalta~rme!"-(" Rather burn than not rise!")&#xD;
A few cheers followed the appearance of this cavalier; but they&#xD;
sounded very coldly and meanly, succeeding those which had&#xD;
honored the man of fortune; and after making his obeisance,&#xD;
Balthazar de Gallegos, dr~w his steed into the background, as if&#xD;
satisfied that his mountain would burn rather unprofitable at the&#xD;
present moment.&#xD;
Vei~y different was the welcome which hailed the appearance&#xD;
of the third challenger. This was our old acquaintance, the amo-&#xD;
rous young cavalier, Nuno de Tobar. Nuno was a favorite with&#xD;
all classes, poor and rich, men no less than women. His known&#xD;
gi'ace and bravery,-his frank carriage, easy, accessible, playful&#xD;
manner,-the generosity of his heart,-the unaffected simplicity&#xD;
of his natuie,-all combined to secure for him the, most sweet&#xD;
voices of the multitude. These became clamorous as the spec-&#xD;
tators beheld the elegance and excellence with which he man-&#xD;
aged the iron-gray charger which he bestrode-the dexterity with&#xD;
which he led him, caracoling, almost waltzing, around the lists,&#xD;
to the foot of the gallery where the Adelan4TLdo, presided. The&#xD;
steed himself was one to delight the eye of all who beheld him,-&#xD;
his symmetrical outline, his fiery grace, and the perfect obedi-&#xD;
ence which he displayed, even wheiv his spirit seemed eager to&#xD;
burst from the bondage of his own frame. The armor of Nuno&#xD;
de Tobar was bright and polished. He had taken some lessons&#xD;
on this subject from the Portuguese brothers, whom he aimed to&#xD;
rival. It was not rich, like that of Vasco de Porcallos, nor in&#xD;
such good taste. In truth, it must be admitted that the tastes&#xD;
of Nuno were inclined to be gaudy. The decorations of his&#xD;
armor, due probably as much to his gay young wife, as to his&#xD;
&#xD;
own tastes, were&#xD;
than a cavalier.&#xD;

Aceytuno was a brilliant animal; ha color something between a&#xD;
sorrel and a bay, but of a blood so rich that it seemed rather to&#xD;
diffuse itself everywhere beneath the skin, through which it shone&#xD;
like a purple dye, than to pursue its bounded course through the&#xD;
ordinary channel of vein and artery.&#xD;
Each of these knights had his motto and coat-of-arms. The&#xD;
shield of Christopher de Spinola carried a pair of huge wings,&#xD;
under which was written, "A solas me sostingo," (Alone I sustain&#xD;
myself;) not a bad image for a modest bachelor, who had neither&#xD;
wife nor children, and was not required to feed the orphans of&#xD;
any of his neighbors. That of the gallant youth, Gonzalo Syl.&#xD;
vestre, would be regarded in our day as something impious, even&#xD;
for a-lover, who is supposed to be excusable, by reason of the&#xD;
amiable insanity under which he labors, for any infidelity except&#xD;
that to his mistress. His shield represented the face of a very&#xD;
beautiful woman, and the motto, "Sin vos, y sin Dios y mi,'7 (With-&#xD;
out thee I am without God and without myself;) was considered&#xD;
by all the young damsels present as the most felicitous of all sweet&#xD;
sayings, to which, whatever might be the objections of the Deity&#xD;
himself; the Blessed Virgin ought by no manner of reason to&#xD;
object at all. The figure upon the shield of Don Mateo de&#xD;
Aceytuno was confined to his profession of arms. A mailed&#xD;
hand grasps a lance; the device was, "No hay otro vinculo que el&#xD;
7&amp;amp;uestro," (" There is no bond of union but ours,"-or, as under.&#xD;
D&#xD;
stood, if not expressed-" we part all bonds but our own.")&#xD;
Mateo de Aceytuno completed the number of the challengers.&#xD;
They now rode together round the lists, prepared to undertake&#xD;
all comers. The first pa sages were tQ be with the lance; to be&#xD;
followed by the battle-a e or sword, according to the~ pleasure&#xD;
of the contending parti ; and the breaking of the lance, the&#xD;
blow fairly delivered wi out defence offered, of the battle-axe;&#xD;
or the sword wrested fr m the gripe of one or other of the com-&#xD;
batants, in the struggle, was understood to be conclusive of the&#xD;
combat in each c~se, and sufficient for the victory.&#xD;
By this time expectation was at the highest point of excitation&#xD;
in the assembly. The galleries were all filled with spectators;&#xD;

topher de Spinola and Gonzalo de Sylvestre, were not less heed-&#xD;
Liii of charms to which they might more properly assert their&#xD;
claims; and, despite his rough exterior, Baithazar de Gallegos&#xD;
showed himself as eager of the notice of the ladies as any of the&#xD;
rest. Of whom, indeed, does not beauty, when it smiles, make&#xD;
the fool ~ The roug~a soldier, seasoned to ill usage and strife,&#xD;
callous to blows, and sworn to plunder, was quite as solicitous&#xD;
of the approval of bright eyes, as the young gallant just about to&#xD;
undertake his devoir to secure his spurs of knighthood.&#xD;
But a rougher parley awaits all the parties. The Adelantado&#xD;
gives the signal for i~he~ assailants to appear. Don Balthazar de&#xD;
Alvaro waves his truncheon; the heralds shout, the trumpets&#xD;
sound, and the trappings of horse again are heard. Soon, the&#xD;
six assailing cavaliers begin to pass into the amphitheatre.&#xD;
We shall be excused from such details, in respect to these, as&#xD;
we have given of th~ challengers, and for obvious reasons. They&#xD;
do not concern the a4ual business of this true chronicle, and enough&#xD;
ha~ been shown~to afford a general idea of the habits, manner~,&#xD;
and characteristics f' the times. We shall, accordingly, confinq&#xD;
ourselves, hereafter, to such persons only as belong to our dra-&#xD;
U&#xD;
matis personae.&#xD;
Of the six assail nts, then, we are required to report that&#xD;
Don Philip de Va onselos ranked oi~ly as the fifth. His own&#xD;
modesty gav~ him his position. He might have led the party,&#xD;
had it pleased him ~to do so. But he preferred simply to take&#xD;
his place as one of s~veral. His brother Andres was not of either&#xD;
party; but this, it must be remembered, did not affect his claims&#xD;
to take the field agfrmnst all, or any, of those who might remain&#xD;
the conquerors.&#xD;
Philip was mou~ited upon a coal-black steed of famous nur-&#xD;
tui~; large of frai~ne, strong of muscle, fleet of foot, hardy to&#xD;
endure, and of a beautiful symmetry. It was a pleasure to be.&#xD;
hold his form, simj~ly as he stood, without motion, obedient to&#xD;
the rein. His eye~ flashed fire as - he darted into the ring, and&#xD;
heard the mingled cries and clamors from a hundred trumpets,&#xD;
and a thousand vc~ices. Though docile as a lamb, his forefoot&#xD;
&#xD;
pawed the earth&#xD;

a sort of sombre nobleness in his aspect that compelled respect-&#xD;

jealous of his nation, increased the admiration of those who sur-&#xD;
veyed his form and w4tche~\l his movements. Of these he reeked&#xD;
little, and perhaps saw nothing; but there were eyes in that&#xD;
great assembly whor~i it thrilled his bosom to feel were behold-&#xD;
ing him also. In the brief moment of communion with the gal-&#xD;
lery, where sate the ~randees of th~ island and their families, his&#xD;
glance had encountei~ed with that of Olivia de Alvaro. ~he had&#xD;
strive~i greatly to av~Ad the single look which she gave him, but&#xD;

brighter and proud~ at the grateful encounter, and he did not&#xD;

cheek grew ashen j~ale. But her emotion did not escape the&#xD;
keen glances of her i~nele; and a close observer might have noted&#xD;
the sudden cont~actkkn of his brows, which followed his discovery.&#xD;

generosity of a nob~e nature, he preferred to keep himself In&#xD;
reserve for such other inequality in the struggle as might yield&#xD;
him an unembarrassed combatant wholly to himself. New&#xD;
lances having been si~tpplied to those who had fractured them fairly&#xD;
in the passage and without disparagement to their arms, the sig.&#xD;
nal was given for a fresh encounter; the vacancies, meanwhile,&#xD;
being supplied in the ranks of both parties. In this second pas-&#xD;
sage, Don Vasco de Porcallos carried himself so handsomely&#xD;
against his opponent, who was a huge Fleming of. nearly his own&#xD;
dimensions, that the latter was incontinently overthrown, and&#xD;
removed almost insensible from the field. A similar fortune,&#xD;
though not with such serious hurt, befell Christopher de Spinola,&#xD;
whose boast "a solas me sostingo," was not justified by the result&#xD;
of the encounter. He was handsomely lifted out of his saddle&#xD;
by the lance of Diego Arias Tinoco, a brave captain, rough as a&#xD;
porcupine, who was honored as standard-bearer of the army.&#xD;
The latter, being now disengaged, was singled out by Nuno de&#xD;
Tobar, and his horse falling, and swerving in the shock, he was&#xD;
adjudged to have been worsted, and very reluctantly yielded for&#xD;
the moment to a conqueror.&#xD;
The successes of Nuno were welcomed right royally by the&#xD;
cheers of the admiring spectators; whose comments, by the&#xD;
way, were administered unsparingly, whether for praise or blame,&#xD;
at every charge in the business of the field. Meanwhile, Philip&#xD;
de Yasconselos has borne himself in a second encounter with the&#xD;
gigantic Mateo de Aceytuno. In the first, a gentle and joyous pas-&#xD;
sage, as the heralds styled it, the~ advantage was decreed to rest&#xD;
with neither. Their lances had been mutually well addressed, and&#xD;
had shivered at the same moment, both knights preserving their&#xD;
seats handsomely, though not, perhaps, with equal grace ;-for&#xD;
Philip had few equals in mere carriage-~and recovered their&#xD;
places in an instant; but proper judgments remarked, in the&#xD;
strong patois of the mountains, that the horse of Mateo had too&#xD;
little bone for his master's beef. In this, he certainly suffered&#xD;
some disadvantage. But the second conflict was decisive; and&#xD;
the knight of Aceytuno went dowii before his more adroit antago-&#xD;

&#xD;
here, had work enough. They will make us glad of all the good&#xD;
lances that will crowd thither under our banner. The Portu-&#xD;
guese is a &amp;amp;ood lance, and his brother, the younger, is a good&#xD;
lance; though where he hides himself at this time, and where-&#xD;
fore, I cannot guess. I had looked' to see him here. Had he&#xD;
been opposed to our fat Vasco Porcallosinstea'd of that clumsy&#xD;

hark! they prepare r Go to it, good knights! Go to it with a&#xD;
stomach! Show that ye have fed on lances! That your daily&#xD;
meat hath been bolt and spear-head, and your drink hath been&#xD;
sword,.blades, and Moorish scimitars! Ho! brave lances! Ho!&#xD;
brave steeds! To it! to it! brave lances, noble steeds !"&#xD;
This was one ~of a hundred voices, eagerly urging the cavaliers&#xD;
to the conflict which was held so equal. Equal in many respects,&#xD;
there were yet some, in which the knight of Portugal, or as they&#xD;
called him, "the Knight of the Homeless Falcon,"-in allusion to&#xD;
his crest-had much the advantage. His steed had been better&#xD;
trained for such encounters; he himself had seen more various&#xD;
service; and he possessed. a sedate and temperate coolness of&#xD;
mind, to which the somewhat mercurial nature of Nuno de To-&#xD;
bar could not lay claim. Above all, he knew just in what&#xD;
particulars he himself was strong and his opponent weak, and&#xD;
he prepared rather to exercise his patience and watchfulness, than&#xD;
his strength and skill. Nuno de Tobar, ambitious of excelling-&#xD;
fighting in the presence of the army, and of that beauty which&#xD;
was usually the source of his inspiration-resolved that Philip de&#xD;
Vasconselos should have need of both. . Besides, he was to fight&#xD;
for the honor of Spanish lances. Though, personally, a devoted&#xD;
friend of his present opponent, he had heard the popular cries&#xD;
which insisted upon their Castilia~ representative, in opposition to&#xD;
the foreign~ knight; and he was determined that Spain's honor&#xD;
should suffer nothing at his hands.&#xD;
But Philip de Vasconselos had also heard these cries. He&#xD;
had long since been bitterly made to feel the jealousy and preju-&#xD;
dices which existed amongst the Castiians towards himself and&#xD;
his Portuguese associates, and the pride of self and nation, which&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ADVERSARIES.&#xD;
rendered resolute his courage, was mingled ~&#xD;
bitterness, which made him half forgetful tha&#xD;
was his friend. hus it was that, as if in reco,&#xD;
culiar wishes of t e multitude, each knight wa~&#xD;
gage in the strug le with a sentiment approach&#xD;
hostility. We h ye said nothing of the influer&#xD;

enough to say tha it did not, by any means, h&#xD;

the approaching c ntroversy.&#xD;
The interval ne essay in providing the cha~&#xD;
lances, tightening t e girths of their saddles, and&#xD;
them ready for the combat, was consumed in m&#xD;
we have taken in describing it. The knights&#xD;
places, and the trumpets sounded the charge.&#xD;
a very beautiful o e, which greatly delighted th&#xD;
lances were shiver d equally, the strokes being&#xD;

enemy. Newly s applied with weapons, the e&#xD;
newed, and with th same results. By this time&#xD;
de Tobar was gro ing impatient. lie felt, ra&#xD;
the coolne&amp;amp;~ of his opponent; in which he knew&#xD;
vantage of the lat er; and with this feeling, it&#xD;
vain that he strove to preserve his own. Phii&#xD;
discerned the restlessness of his adversary, in&#xD;
stance, which drewd wn upon the Spanish cliampio&#xD;
applause of the m altitude. In receiving a fre~&#xD;
herald, and while w ceiling about to recover his&#xD;
lists, De Tobar hur ed the lance no less than t&#xD;
the air, catching it exterously as it fell, and e&#xD;
proper grasp. Suc agility, which seemed co&#xD;
crowd of equal co dence and skill, appeared&#xD;
Philip de asconsel s a proof of a nervous excitat&#xD;

Tobar, had been addressed to the shield of. his opponent. This&#xD;
was the common mark in the tournament of that day; the want&#xD;
of exercise making the atteint more difficult when addressed to&#xD;
the gorget, or the helm; but the cavalier of Portugal had prac-&#xD;
tised the one method as well as the other, and not designing a&#xD;
surpriseupon his opponent, he shook out his lance, ere the trum-&#xD;
pets sounded, and levelled it in the direction of De Tobar's visor.&#xD;
The hint seemed to be taken, for~the lance of the latter was at&#xD;
once slightly elevated, receiving a new direction in his glance.&#xD;
Thus prepared, the signal was given, and they hurried to the&#xD;
shock. At the moment of crossing spears, his point still ad-&#xD;
dressed to the visor of his opponent, Vasconselos threw suddenly&#xD;
the lower edge of his shield forwards, inclining it over his own&#xD;
head, and watching the object of his aim from beneath the very&#xD;
rim of the buckler. No time was left the other for providing&#xD;
against this peculiar interposition of the shield, which required&#xD;
him to have aimed so truly as to thrust his lance directly against&#xD;
the visor of his antagonist, the crest of whrch was totally covered,&#xD;
leaving the mark aimed at reduced to the smallest possible size.&#xD;
The skill of Tobar was not equal to such a manoeuvre. The&#xD;
point of his lance accordingly struck the edge of the raised shield,&#xD;
and glanced upward,. and onward, over the smooth surface, ex-&#xD;
pending itself in air; while the point of Vasconselos, admirably&#xD;
delivered, was rjveted in the bars of his antagonist's visor, so&#xD;
firmly, and so fairly, that there was no escape, no evasion of it&#xD;
possible; and the gall~n~ Nuno was borne from his saddle, with-&#xD;
out seeming resistance. Indeed, the spear so fixed, the onward&#xD;
rush of' both steeds gave it an impulse which no skill, no strength,&#xD;
at such a moment, could possibly withstand. It carried him&#xD;
headlong to the ground, and the steed went free from under&#xD;
1dm.&#xD;
There was a cry, almost a howl, from the multitude, at the&#xD;
thll of their favorite, and the national~ champion.&#xD;
"Demordos!" sang out the swell mob in the corridor, who&#xD;
flung up their arms with their voices, and swore, and tore their&#xD;

had been so roughly handled, to entertain a reasonable appre-&#xD;
hension of the consequences to himself; and, if the truth were&#xD;
known, he was in little humor for this last grand passage. Could&#xD;
lie have retired from the contest without discredit, and without&#xD;
utter forfeiture of the honors he had already Won, it is perhaps&#xD;
doing him no injustice to say that he would most certainly have&#xD;
declined it. He had not gone through his fatigues without suf-&#xD;
fering. His portly frame, for a long time unused to harness,&#xD;
was now shrinking beneath its incumbrance. He was reeking&#xD;
with perspiration, which a brimming goblet of' cool wine of Xeres,&#xD;
which he had just~swallowed, had not tended to diminish. But,&#xD;
with all his annoyances and doubts, he put on a good countenance,&#xD;
and, closing up his visor, prepared for the encounter, with his&#xD;
best hope and spirit.&#xD;
"The fat knight adds but another to the trophies of our Por-&#xD;

the field; certainly, he hath most admirable skill of horse and&#xD;
weapon. He hath but a single joust before him, and then he&#xD;
may elect the Queen of Love and Beauty 1,'&#xD;
This was said by Don Balthazar de Alvaro. It was addressed&#xD;
to the lady of the Aclelantado. But it was meant for other&#xD;
~ears. At a little distance, on the left of Hernan de Soto, stood&#xD;
Andres de Yasconselos. He had been a witness of all that had&#xD;
taken place; and had heard the significant words of Oliyia's un-&#xD;
cle. For a moment he gazed steadily upon the field; then, giving&#xD;
asin~e glance at Olivia, ~hose color had been greatly heightened&#xD;
by her emotions during the scene, he was about to leave the&#xD;
scaffolding, when the words of the Adelantado reached his ears~&#xD;
.-nbt spoken aloud, but rat her as if giving expression to a feel.&#xD;

than his policy:&#xD;
"Now, would I give my best steed could Vasco Porcallo~&#xD;

himself in armor; that he bids them get ready his destrier, that&#xD;
he buckles sword to his side, and shakes aloft the heavy lance,&#xD;
and tries its burden with his hands. Let us leave him, and re-&#xD;
turn to the amphitheatre.&#xD;

champions dashed rward to the encounter v~ii h a desperate&#xD;
speed that threateuie to annihilate both combat~n s. There was&#xD;
no reluctance in the marriage and conduct of the rich cavalier,&#xD;
however great might have been his secret misgi ings. While&#xD;
he, no doubt, question ed his ow-n resources of skil and strength&#xD;
against an opponent ho had always proved himse f most formi-&#xD;
dable, yet the doubt of Don Vasco never once occasioned any&#xD;
fears in his bosom. He wa~ brave enough when the trial was&#xD;
to be made. He wa not destined to be success I, but he was&#xD;
spared some of the fortifications of defeat. A m fortune hap-&#xD;
pened to. him, while in mid career, which proba ly saved our&#xD;
corpulent cavalier fro ~ a much worse evil. His steed, which&#xD;
was as high-spirited a he was powerful, trod upo the barbed&#xD;
head of a broken lanc which had been pai~tly burie out of sight&#xD;
beneath the sands of the arena. The sharp poin of the steel&#xD;
touched the quick of t e animal's foot, and, with a snort of ter-&#xD;
ror, he wheeled about t the very moment when the 1 nces should&#xD;

&#xD;
Portugal elevated his own lance, and, having full control of his&#xD;
steed, drew him suddenly up, arresting him in his full speed so&#xD;
admirably, that he stood quivering upon the spot; the unexpended&#xD;
impulse which he had received now shaking him as with an ague.&#xD;
In another instant, Philip de Vasconselos was on his feet, an~&#xD;
had grasped the bridle of the unmanageable steed of his riva1,~&#xD;
which, by this time, w~s in a state of fury, occasioned by the&#xD;
agony of his hurt, which threatened momently to unseat his&#xD;
rider. The timely service enabled Don Yasco to alight, and&#xD;
gratefully acknowledging the assistance rendered he at the sam~&#xD;
time acknowledged himself vanquished.' The courtesy of hi~&#xD;
opponent, indeed, had alone spared him this misfortune. Do4&#xD;
Philip gracefully rejected this acknowledgment, and, ascribing&#xD;
the event solely to the sufferings of his rival's horse, propose&#xD;
that Don Vasco should find another. But, by this time, the&#xD;
chivalrous feelings of the latter had soniewhat subsided. He felt&#xD;
much less enthusiastic than before~ and was rather pleased now&#xD;
~ at a means of evasion, which, whiP it lost him the final honor of&#xD;
the day, at least left him in possession of the credit which he had&#xD;
acquired in the previous, passages. The knight of the Falcon.&#xD;
remounted his own steed, and resumed his place within the list~.&#xD;
He stood alone, and in expectation. No champion stood before&#xD;
him, challenging the triumph~which he had won,-the crownin~&#xD;
triumph of the field. There was a sudden and deep silence&#xD;
throughout the assembly. The feeling was everywhere adverse&#xD;
to his claims and expectations; and it was with something of&#xD;
contempt, not unmixed with bitterness, that our knight of Por-&#xD;
tugal was reminded of the national prejudice, which felt relu4-&#xD;
tant to do justice to the achievements of the' stranger. Ther~&#xD;
w~s no other reason for the silence and forbearance of Don&#xD;
ilernan de Soto, who, in the case of a Castilian champion, or&#xD;
in that of one to ~whom he felt no personal prejudice, would, no&#xD;
doubt, have promptly risen in his place, and summoned the su~.&#xD;
cessful knight forward, to choose the Queen of Love and Beaut~r,&#xD;
and to receive the chaplet of honor at her hands. There was up&#xD;
reason why the award should not be promptly made.' The~~&#xD;

&#xD;
"Thou too, my brother! Thou hast then joined with mine&#xD;
enemies-ay, and thy enemies too-against me I"&#xD;
The visor of Andres was already closed, and Philip could not&#xD;
behold his face; but he could readily conjecture the ci~imson&#xD;
flush which covered it,-the usual sign of his intemperate pas-~&#xD;
sion. He had been somewhat surprised, that Andres had taken~&#xD;
?&amp;amp;O part in the tournament before; but the feeling was not on~&#xD;
of regret, since, as we have seen, he had already entertained some&#xD;
misgivings that his brother might take the field against himself&#xD;
'We have not forgotten the fierce dialogue which had taken plac~&#xD;
between them on t~his subject. Of course, Philip de Vasconselos&#xD;
entertained no personal apprehensions from the encounter. Illis&#xD;
pride was in no way alarmed, lest he should meet with over&#xD;
throw, in the passage-at-arms with his brother. Indeed, to spea1~&#xD;
plainly, Philip knew too well his own superiority of training,&#xD;
art, and muscle; though the vanity of Andres was suchrthat he&#xD;
had persuaded himself to a very different estimate .of their mu-&#xD;
tual powers. He was yet to be taught a better knowledge of&#xD;
their disparity. The reluctance of Philip to engage in such a&#xD;
contest, even though the tournament implied neither strife nor&#xD;
malice, was based upon his just knowledge of human nature;&#xD;
upon his thorough experience jn respect to the mood and char-&#xD;
acter of Andres-his passionate blood; his disappointments of&#xD;
heart; his jealousy of the superior influence and reputation of&#xD;
his brother, We can readily divine the several reasons which&#xD;
governed Philip in his anxiety to escape a conflict, in regard to&#xD;
which he yet entertained no fears. Now that they stood con-&#xD;
fronted, and the contest was inevitable, he endeavored to calm&#xD;
his own blood, and control his temper, somewhat excited by the&#xD;
circumstances which had marked his treatment by the Adelan-&#xD;
tado and the assembly. But this was not so difficult. The re-&#xD;
ception of Andres, by the audience, was of a sort to kindle in&#xD;
the elder brother a sentiment of passionate indignation, as it&#xD;
declared~ how grateful to the common feeling wo~ild be his over-&#xD;
throw. The multitude hailed the entry of the~ new champion&#xD;
with the wildest plaudits, not simply as he promised to prolong&#xD;
&#xD;
their sports, but as&#xD;

&#xD;
of his desire. Why should he take the field now, unless with&#xD;
the aim to pluck them from the brow of. his brother ~ It was a&#xD;
bad passion-hate, revenge, anything but an honorable ambition&#xD;
-which prompted his appearance now, at the last moment.&#xD;
Olivia thought all these things. Such were the thoughts of&#xD;
Philip also. But he strove to restrain and silence them; and, in&#xD;
the brief interval allowed him, his inward struggle w~s to subdue&#xD;
himself;-to keep his own bad passions in subjection, and to offer&#xD;
no such provocation to those of his brother, as would place him&#xD;
entirely beyond control of human reason. He resolved to be&#xD;
forbearing in all respects. But this did not imply that he would&#xD;
forego any of his resources of skill or strength in the conflict.&#xD;
He was not, by any means, to yield his laims to the honors of&#xD;
the field, in favor of any opponent. On his point he was reso.&#xD;
lute; and, thus resolved, it became hi ,if he would effect his&#xD;
triumph, and avoid giving unnecessary revocation, or inflicting&#xD;
mortification upon his brother, that he s oul&amp;amp; maintain the cool.&#xD;
est temper, and suffer nothing to distu b his passions. It re.&#xD;
quired some effort to do this, for he had felt bitterly his isolation&#xD;
in the last few moments,-a feeling sadly increased, when, as he&#xD;
phrased it, his own brother had joined his enemies against him.&#xD;
We must not allow it to be supposed that the Adelantado&#xD;
beheld the opening of the new issue between these parties, with.&#xD;
out being somewhat sensible to the strangeness of its aspects.&#xD;
His instincts, too, were at work; and remembering to have&#xD;
heard of the quarrel between the brothers, he began to think&#xD;
there was something unnatural in the approaching combat. His&#xD;
conscience reproached him for the ungenerous delay which had&#xD;
kept Philip de Vasconselos from the crown of victory, and af.&#xD;
forded the opportunity for the event, of the results and character&#xD;
of which he had grown apprehensive; and he looked dubiously&#xD;
at the warder of the field, Don Balthazar de Alvaro, and for&#xD;
the first time felt suspicious of those motives, on his part, which&#xD;
had moved him to urge the delay in closing the lists. But there&#xD;
was now no moment for arrest and interposition, unless by the&#xD;
exercise of a seemingly arbitrary authority, which would show&#xD;
&#xD;

ha4 been furnished, he muttered to hims if, as he shook it aloft,&#xD;
-.-~" If thou fail me, I will look to surer w apon."&#xD;
The third passage was waited for with great impatience by the&#xD;
multitude. The previous combats seemed to have been mere&#xD;
child's play to these. Every~ one felt th~t the present passages&#xD;
were~ marked by passion much more serious than those of chiv-&#xD;
alric courtesy, even when stimulated bLy ambition, or urged&#xD;
by the desire of doing greatly in the ey s of love and beauty.&#xD;
The spectators were now hushed and brea Mess. The occasional&#xD;
formulas&#xD;
cri~s of the heralds, repeating the old  of encouragement,&#xD;
seemed very unmeaning sounds in respect to such a conflict.&#xD;
They were felt almost as impertinence; and, indeed, by this&#xD;
time, the heralds themselves seemed to a rive at this opinion, for&#xD;
they suddenly became silent. All now as eager expectation.&#xD;
The ~signal followed, and the passage. There was the same&#xD;
fearful concussion, as before; the clouds f dust; the confusion.'&#xD;
But the results were more decided, and the encounter was fol-&#xD;
lowed by a wild, sharp cry, full of rage nd fury. Soon, Philip&#xD;
de Vasconselos emerged out of the dust- 4oud, and coursed once&#xD;
round the rThg; a moment after, Andr4s was beheld, on foot,&#xD;
with his battle-axe in his hand, and dartii~g after his brother with&#xD;
the ferocity and speed of a tiger. The steed of the younger&#xD;
knight was down, rolling over in the san~1; by what hurt or ac-&#xD;
cktent, no one could conjecture. He hi self had all the action&#xD;
of a madman. His fine scarf was riven; his armor covered with&#xD;
dust, and his helmet thrown off. His hair, which was long,&#xD;
~floated wildly; his fake was crimson wit passion, and his eyes&#xD;
glared with a fury which threatened to destroy everything in his&#xD;
path. He made headlong way toward~ Don Philip, who had&#xD;
now drawn up his steed, and stood quietly, if not calmly, await-&#xD;
ing him at the barriers, which was as fa1r hack as he ~could re-&#xD;
cede. Here he must stop and encounter what should happen,&#xD;
if he would not incur the disgrace of seething to fly, which would&#xD;
have befallen him should he again put his horse in motion to&#xD;
&#xD;
escape from furth&#xD;

his truncheon if he had pleased to do so, a d for the heral1&#xD;
guards to have interposed. Nuno de Tol4r had entreate~&#xD;
Baithazar to arrest the combat' when it promised to be b&#xD;
but he was unheeded.&#xD;
"There is danger, I tell thee, Don B~lthazar! Don 2&#xD;
hath no control of himself in his passion, and see you n&#xD;
the victory already rests with Don Philip f?"&#xD;
"Nay," said the other-" three strokes may be tak'~&#xD;
the sword or battle-axe, according ito the wishes of the c&#xD;
ants, after the passage with the lance."&#xD;
"~Only where the passage with the lan~e results in no&#xD;
tage to either," was the reply of Tobar.&#xD;
"Yet, I see not why they should be checked in a new r&#xD;
if the parties desire it."&#xD;
"But Don Philip, you perceive, does t~ot desire it."&#xD;
"Then, by my troth, he loses some of his renown as&#xD;
nor. He should face his foe with any w a on."&#xD;
Nuno de Tobar was furious at these w~rds, and greatly&#xD;
hensive; and his passion might have expI~oded in a&#xD;
challenge of the justice and magnanimity of the Ade&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
"We charge these women leave the co~irt,&#xD;
Lest they should swoon."  ~ETnM    Ow&#xD;
THE effect of this scene was prodigious up~n the whole ass&#xD;
bly. Its events were just of that sort to fill the minds and e~&#xD;
the imaginations of such a swelling, earnest, ~rave yet passion~&#xD;
people as the Spaniards; and, for awhile, th~y were all husi&#xD;
as if overwhelmed with emotion, and still ex~ectiug other ev&#xD;
of even greater excitement to follow. They were conquered&#xD;
the Portuguese. The deportment of Philip de Vasconselos&#xD;
been such as to impress* every spectator '~vith the full s&#xD;
of his noble character and perfect heroism, and there ~&#xD;
none now so bold as to challenge his triumph or his fa&#xD;
Verily, he had gone through the most fearful of all trials for&#xD;
a soul. He had survived them, though he suffered from ~&#xD;
still. He had overcome those worst enemi ~s, his own pas~&#xD;
which, wronged on eVery hand, and fiercely assailed by the~&#xD;
above all others, who should have approached them with nol&#xD;
but love and veneration, had been able to subdue thems&#xD;
within just limits, and permitted him to ripe equally abov&#xD;
enemies and his own blood! This ~was not lost upq&#xD;
spectators. Their hush was only the prelu e to their app&#xD;
Their instincts, kept in lively play all the wh le, and making&#xD;
forgetful of all their former dislikes and jealous ies, had brought&#xD;
final judgments right. Their souls, as they beheld, became&#xD;
conscious of the rare beauty of his carriage and his perform&#xD;

throughout; and the gentle humanity, whi h, at the closing&#xD;
scene, had appeared so conspicuously In uni on with the mos&#xD;
determined courage and the coolest conduct. e wildest shout&#xD;
testified their admiration, and declared the co plete triumph oi&#xD;
the hero of the day, not only Over all oppone ts, but over theji&#xD;
own stubborn and ungenerous prejudices. Th y did not see thc&#xD;
bitter smile that mantled the face of Philip as e heard these up.&#xD;
roars of admiration, lie knew the value of popular applause,&#xD;
and quietly rein counting his steed, he stood in ence waiting for&#xD;
the summons of the warder, to the foot of th dais, where the&#xD;
Adelantado was to place the crown upon the ance of the con:&#xD;
queror, who was required, in turn, to lay it a the foot of the&#xD;
lady whom he should designate as the Queen of Love arid Beauty.&#xD;
It was her task to accept the tribute, and, lifting up the trophy so&#xD;
deposited, to place it on the head of her ehampi n.&#xD;
There was no reluctance, now, on the part of the Adelantado&#xD;
to do justice to the knight of the Falcon. De Soto, it is true,&#xD;
had his prejudices as well as his people; and his pride had been&#xD;
somewhat stung by the reserve which had been e hibited towards&#xD;
him by Philip de Vasconselos; to say nothing of the olThnce&#xD;
which the latter had given, in announcing his dou ts in respect to&#xD;
his farther connection with the expeditioii to orida. But,&#xD;
though a proud and selfish person, De Soto was ot a base one.&#xD;
lie had his moments of prejudice and passion, but was by no&#xD;
means insensible to greatness of soul and heroic character, even&#xD;
in the instance of an enemy. lie was thorough disarmed by&#xD;
the conduct of Philip; and some compunctious v stings of con~&#xD;
science now made him anxious to atone, as far s possible, by&#xD;
the most prompt acknowledgment, for his past co dress and ne-&#xD;
glect. lie bade the warder do his duty, and, at signal given,&#xD;
and amidst a passionate faifare from the whole orps of trum-&#xD;
peters, the knight of the Falcon was led up to the f ot of the dais.&#xD;
Here he dismounted uncovered his head, ascen ed the rude&#xD;
steps, which had ~been hastily placed~ for the purpose, and pre-&#xD;
sented his lance at the bidding of De Soto, who,~ a warm and&#xD;
graceful speech, of a few sentences, placed upon it ~he trophy aa.&#xD;

signed to the conqueror. This was a beauti~ui coronet, or c&#xD;
of rich purple velvet, encircled with a chap~et of pearls, in&#xD;
centre of which flamed a single but large di~imond, surround&#xD;
by rubies and other precious stones. Don l~hilip received&#xD;
prize with the most graceful obeisance, but iii profound siler&#xD;
then advancing to the foot of the seat oecupi~d by Olivia de&#xD;
varo, he knelt, and laid the coronet before )aeit, dropping his h&#xD;
at. the same moment beside him. Again th~ trumpets soun&#xD;
in a soft but capricious Saracenic strain, wh~le the heralds c:&#xD;
aloud the name of the. lady;. and De Soto, rising, proclaim&#xD;
her the Queen and Beauty of the tournament. We shall&#xD;
nothing of the envy sparkling all the while in the eyes of&#xD;
other fair dames in that fair assemblage; Wi the breast of&#xD;
of whom, no doubt~ there had lurked hopes more or less li~&#xD;
during the progress of the day. However slight their h(&#xD;
when it was seen who was to be the successful champion, w&#xD;
still easily understand how there should be many disapp&#xD;
inents. Of course, there was much criticism, also, upon the ci&#xD;
of the knight of Portugal; and while moat of them couli&#xD;
mit cheerfully his superior claims as a warrior,-his skill, ~1&#xD;
and address, in the tourney,-there were not a few to r&#xD;
that so much heroism should be accompanied by so very I&#xD;
taste. But the multitude applauded the taste, no less thar&#xD;
valor and conduct of the knight.&#xD;
It was now the task of Olivia de Alvaro to place the coi&#xD;
on the brows of her champion. This was no easy task, ho'~&#xD;
grateful. She had been an excited spectator of the scene&#xD;
had felt, with constant trembling of heart and frame, all&#xD;
vicissitudes of the conflict. These were rendered trebl~ act&#xD;
consequence of that secret history of grief of which we I&#xD;
something already; the action of which2 on a system v&#xD;
nerves were all disordered, was of a sort to enfeeble and e&#xD;
at the same moment; so that but little strength was left h(&#xD;
the performancee of her task at the closing scene of the day.&#xD;
she arose, after a brief delay; the Knight of the Falcon st~&#xD;
his knees before her. There was a dead silence now in ti&#xD;

was not simply to place the crown upon the h~ad of the cham&#xD;

of the honor conf~~rred upon herself+to bestow applause upon&#xD;
his perforrnan~es, and to utter those exhortations to future deeds&#xD;
of chivalry.and valor, which are supposed nat rally to follow,&#xD;
where Beauty encourages, and Love is the g ntle counsellor.&#xD;
She arose slowly, amid that general hush of ex citation, which,&#xD;
by the way, increased her confusion; stooped to he crown which&#xD;
rested upon the footstool where Philip had laid t; lifted it, and&#xD;
advanced a step, in order to place it on his hea . At this nac..&#xD;
inent their eyes met; a~ sudden and ashen pale ess Overspread&#xD;
her cheeks; her heart, beating wildly but a moment before,&#xD;
seemed at once frozen within her; and she tottered, sunk for-&#xD;
wards, and would have fallen to the floor, but that the swift arms&#xD;
of her lover caught and sustained her. She had fainted from the&#xD;
conflict of emotions which she could no longer sustain and live!&#xD;

THEN it was, whi e all was commotiont in the assembly&#xD;
the passionate l ve ~f Don Philip for the unconscious da&#xD;
his arms; overcame and banished all the previous cal&#xD;
steadfastness in his manner. He thought her dead. Th&#xD;
no color in her cheeks, no life in her eyes, no pulsation&#xD;
veins. He cried aloud for succor, while drawing her clo&#xD;
his bosom, as if to warm her anew with his own tum&#xD;
fires. Before any one could interpose, he had borne her 1&#xD;
the seat, supporting her with vigorous arm, and appealing&#xD;
consciousness by the most endearing efforts and expression&#xD;
was at that moment freed from all the conventional re&#xD;
which had hithierto made his passion cautious, and taug&#xD;
cealment as the proper policy of love. He was now not&#xD;
lin that the world should hear what he had hitherto ne&#xD;
elred to her, and with the-sense of her danger and his 1&#xD;
became indifferent to the. opinion of those around, a re&#xD;
which is characteristic of the proud and sensitive natur&#xD;
he was not'suffered long to indulge in a situation which h&#xD;
so painfully sweet. He was brought to consciousness by&#xD;
terosition of other persons. Don Balthazar de Alvaro w&#xD;
at his side, and, laying his hand with rather a rude gras&#xD;
the shoulder of our knight, he bade him release the lady I&#xD;
who could better effect her restoration, and who were th&#xD;

compelled to 'esign her. To these he yielded her, though with&#xD;
reluctance. Je shook off the grasp of Don Baithazar, and an-&#xD;
swered his lodks and words with an abruptness of manner, and a&#xD;
glance of fire, which declared the hostility and scorn which he&#xD;
truly felt, and in which the uncle was taught to read the language&#xD;
Qf defiance. livia was borne away by the female attendants.&#xD;
The Lady Isabella would have had her conveyed to her palace,&#xD;
but Don Balthitzar, in a very resolute manner, resisted this ar-&#xD;
rangement, an4 she was conveyediat once to his own residence.&#xD;
The amusements of the day were over. The trumpets sounded'the&#xD;
retreat ; the audience slowly melted away ; but long before the&#xD;
assembly was ~ispersed, Philjp de Vasconselos had disappeared&#xD;
from the public sight.&#xD;
-He proceede9i at once to the lodgings of his brother, but did&#xD;
not see him, as he feared that his presence would only inch ease&#xD;
the disorder of the latter. He ascertained, however, that hi .de-&#xD;
lirum and fever -did not increase, and that he was well -at-&#xD;
tended. The p 1ysician of De Soto himself had been sent,&#xD;
and had. admini tered some soothing drugs, after taking romn&#xD;
him a goodly qi antity of blood. He still remained with hiim,&#xD;
and would not suffer him to be disturbed. The attack had been&#xD;
severe as sudden, but it was not of prolonged duration; and judi-&#xD;
cious treatment, seconded by the youth and vigor of his constitu-&#xD;
tion, en abled hin, after a few days, to rise again to his feet. In a&#xD;
veek he was abl~ to resume his armor, and to exercise at the&#xD;
head of his little company. But he remained comparatively fee-&#xD;
be for some time, and the mortification which he had suffered&#xD;
hung like a dark shadow upon his soul. He became habitually&#xD;
gomy and nmor se ; addressing himself wholly to military stu-&#xD;
dies and exercise ,and never suffering himself to be seen in so-&#xD;
scey. Gadual he began to entertain more just and generous&#xD;
feings towards is brother, though from this period there was&#xD;
no longer any coi iality between them. The events which were&#xD;
yet to occur served, in great degree, to disarm him of that&#xD;
jealous hostility to Philp which had been the sole cause of his&#xD;
recent madness Philip, though solicitous of his health and&#xD;

safety, never obtruded himself upon him. He was cont&#xD;
'leave to time the work of repair. But we must not antici&#xD;
The recovery of Olivia de Alvaro was much more rapi&#xD;
that of her rejected lover. What remedies were em~&#xD;
in her case, were not suffered tobe known; but the very ne&#xD;
found her able to situp and converse. Leonora de Tobar sati&#xD;
time with her. Donna Isabella was also pleased to vis~&#xD;
and other ladies shared in their friendly attentions. But~&#xD;
recovering her consciousness, and in some degree her health,&#xD;
sank into a sort of sober melancholy, which no arts or att~&#xD;
of her female companions could possibly reach. An exterior~&#xD;
most stolid indifference encountered the friendly solicitude&#xD;
sought to soothe and heal; and while her deportment was&#xD;
tleness and meekness, her heart was yet closed against all ef&#xD;
probe its secret, or ascertain its apprehensions or its wants.&#xD;
onorade Tobar her case seemed a singularly mysterious or&#xD;
knew that she loved Philip de Vasconselos beyond all oth4&#xD;
She was now sure, as was all the world, that he loved her'&#xD;
all other women. What more? Why should either of then&#xD;
happy? The whole affair was very incomprehensible to I&#xD;
afforded her a fruitful and constant subject for expostulati&#xD;
the sufferer, and speculation with all other parties.&#xD;
Don Balthazar was the only person who properly und&#xD;
* the whole difficulty. He. had his fears of the case, as ~&#xD;
full knowledge of its peculiarities. His hope of security,&#xD;
to say, was based upon what he knew to be the virtues&#xD;
damsel. He relied wholly upon her justice and magnani&#xD;
defeat the" suit of the Knight of Portugal. But his fears ~&#xD;
active. He apprehended that the weakness of the woma&#xD;
get the better part of her sense of justice. He knew th&#xD;
ous nature of the sex, and the paramount strength of th&#xD;
ings. Could Olivia really be capable of rejecting the lovE&#xD;
she preferred before all others, simply because of a col&#xD;
inent of honor and propriety? Why should she not kee&#xD;
eret, and thus secure her triumph? He still dreaded&#xD;

present 'all his security. Of course it is understood that he can&#xD;
never be reconciled to her union with Philip, or, indeed, with any&#xD;
man. We hav~ but imperfectly unfolded our narrative thus far,&#xD;
if it be now necessary that we should endeavor to establish this&#xD;
fact. His selfishness at once of avarice and passion, was a set.&#xD;
tled necessity, a d utterly adverse to her finding happiness, ac-&#xD;
cording to the dictates of her affections.&#xD;
But it was necessary to confirm her in her Previously expressed&#xD;
and virtuous resolution of self-denial, lie was required to&#xD;
strengthen her dE~termination against the pleadings of her owii&#xD;
'heart, as well as f her lover, to lessen the strength. of her feel-&#xD;
ings by stimulatit~g her propriety, and to keep her virtuous mag&#xD;
unanimity active, ,~s a barrier against her passion. This he now&#xD;
perceived to be ore Powerful than he, or even she, had previ-&#xD;
ously suspected, lie had watched her through all the caprices&#xD;
of the tournament and had seen the warmth and violence of her&#xD;
feelings, written ii her face and action amidst all the changes of&#xD;
the struggle. "Sl~ie is not to be trusted to her own sentiments,."&#xD;
was his reflection. "She may resolve as she pleases, in her quiet&#xD;
moments of thought; but let Philip de Vasconselos kneel im-&#xD;
ploring at her feet,~ and she will probably forget all her honorable&#xD;
resolves. She wil yield to his entreaties, before she~is conscious&#xD;
of the extremity o~ her admissions. I must provide against this."&#xD;
Let us see what ar~ his for effecting his objects.&#xD;
Olivia was recli irig upo a couc in the apartment opening&#xD;
Upon the vdrandah. There Don Balthazar suddenly presented&#xD;
himself. She looked up at his appearance, with eyes full of sc~&#xD;
sad a reproach thaij, had he been capable of a generous impres&#xD;

capable of' the nobl ness of self-reproach A more cold, selfish,&#xD;

rises at any our, with the winds, to blot its beautiful surface.&#xD;
But whether t e world knows or not-whether God permits the&#xD;

enough that I know the terrible shame that hangs upon my soul&#xD;

"Why, then~ leave it to doubt? Why impose upon me the&#xD;
task which you yet think me too weak to execute? Forbid him&#xD;
the house-forbid him the quest-and put an end to all your ap-&#xD;
prehensions."&#xD;
"Would that process be effectual? No, no! my child, that&#xD;
will never answer. Our customs here, in Cuba, would not suffer&#xD;

a thousand strikes and embarrassments. Besides, Don Philip de&#xD;
Vasconselos wo~ild not suffer any such evasion; and the Adelan-&#xD;
tado would sustain him in the assertion of the right to see you.&#xD;
No! no! he m~~st not be denied every opportunity, and the whole&#xD;

hastily out of t~ie apartment.&#xD;

Philip came to I~er, and brought with it fancies of the most. bi~ight&#xD;
and cheering feficity. She fancied him at her feet; she tho~igh;&#xD;
of herself in his arms. The world shut out, in the lone security&#xD;
of their mountain hacienda, she - said to herself-" Surely this is&#xD;
happiness,-.this is security and peace! And why," she asked of&#xD;
herself "should I not enjoy this peace, this 'security, this happi-&#xD;

I guilty of this crime-this shame? Is it mine? Am I not a&#xD;
wretched victim only of the toils, and the arts, and the superior&#xD;
powers of another? Have I, in my own soul, consented to this&#xD;
surrender of my innocence to' the spoiler? Wherefore should I&#xD;
suffer more? Rive I not suffered enough? Why should I not&#xD;
be happy with him I love, true to him ever, and never willingly&#xD;

whither would you carry me? Would you have me abuse&#xD;

THE public sports which the Adelantado had pi&#xD;

day, which it becomes us not to suffer to pass un&#xD;

yond the reach of a good officer! See to it! This night is all&#xD;
that is left thee to effect his capture, Half of these people will&#xD;
be off to the country by the dawn; he, probably, among them.&#xD;
Seek him at the tents and tables where they game. All of&#xD;
his class have a terrible passion for cards and dice. At the cock-&#xD;
pits he may be found. He hath possibly brought with him some&#xD;
favorite birds from the country. He drinks, too, with a rare&#xD;
passion, which will no doubt carry him to the shops where the&#xD;
aguardiente is to be had. Get thee a dozen of thy fellows, well&#xD;
counselled, who know the man, and set them on the quest for&#xD;
him in all these phees. If you take him, you shall all be well re-&#xD;
warded. If not, I shall endeavor to find officers who need no&#xD;
exhortation to their duty. There is no reason why he should&#xD;
not be found. He showed himself quite freely and fearlessly at the&#xD;
bull-fight, relying, I suppose, on certain changes of dress and&#xD;
costume. He is hardly in hiding any where, and, while in&#xD;
Havana, will no doubt be found at one or other of the places&#xD;
I have mentioned. Stint not your efforts, nor the numbers of your&#xD;
men, nor the needful money; and, if you take him, bring him to&#xD;
me at "the Grove;" at midnight, even; so that ye delay&#xD;
not after you have taken him. Enough! see to it, Diego, as you&#xD;
would be s5e of my favors.&#xD;
"Seijor, I will not sleep in this search."&#xD;
"Good! to it at once, for he will doubtless soon leave Havana&#xD;
for the mountains."&#xD;
The Hidalgo separated from the Alguazil, and both disap-&#xD;
peared from sight. Within the same hour Don Balthazar might&#xD;
be seen riding, on a famous black charger, towards the retreat,&#xD;
without the city, where the Seiiorita, his niece, maintained her&#xD;
solitude. It was but a little before this, that the very outlaw,&#xD;
the mestizo slave, Mateo, might have been seen, on foot, pursu-&#xD;
ing the same route. The latter had fairly entered the woods,&#xD;
when he heard the sound of hors~'s feet behind him. He im-&#xD;
mediately sheltered himself from sight in a dense thicket of&#xD;
bamboo, and, from his place of retreat, beheld the knight ride&#xD;

&#xD;
keen sight and tenacious memory of Don. Balthazar. Of the&#xD;
death of the old woman, Mateo had learned nothing until he&#xD;
reached Havana, a few days before. But, in that time, he had&#xD;
seen his sister, the sullen girl, Juana, on several secret occasions;&#xD;
had heard all her tidings; had listened to all her complaints, and&#xD;
had decided upon the course to be pursued for attaining all&#xD;
necessary remedies for his own and her alleged wrongs. Of&#xD;
these remedies w~ shall learn hereafter. We need not say, per-&#xD;
haps, that he laug~ied at all the labors of his mother, in striving&#xD;
to procure. his foi~giveness, ~is a fugitive slave. He was one of&#xD;
those reckless persons, too savage for subjection, too indolent for&#xD;
toil, who prefer to appropriate the labors of others to the exer-&#xD;
cise of any of his own; and, by the strong .hand, or sleight of&#xD;
hand, contrived to extract a very comfortable living out of a&#xD;
world which he thought good for nothing else. Now that he&#xD;
was in Havana, he was resolved to bring about the settlement&#xD;
of all his affairs in that city; and his own and sister's accounts~&#xD;
promised to employ him actively for a time. His old master&#xD;
was his chief debtor; and, that he did not emerge from his bamboo&#xD;
shelter, and insist upon immediate payment, while the knight&#xD;
was passing, was simply because he thought it very possible that&#xD;
I2~on Balthazar did not carry a sufficient amount in funds about&#xD;
with him, to enable him to make satisfactory settlement. It&#xD;
would have been, otherwise, quite as easy to spring out from his&#xD;
hiding-place upon the Don, as, from the corridor into the bull-ring,&#xD;
giving the coup de grace to El .Aforo! The knight was suffered&#xD;
to proceed in safety to his house, whither Mateo followed more&#xD;
slowly, and not until the darkness had fairly covered the hacienda.&#xD;
We shall suffer several hours to elapse with out reporting their&#xD;
events; but we must suppose that they have not been suffered&#xD;
to pass unemployed either by the Hidalgo or the outlaw. Nay,&#xD;
we beg to state that both parties have heen busy, though we do&#xD;
not just now care to go into a narrative of their several doings.&#xD;
Enough, that towards midnight Don Balthazar ceased from his&#xD;
labors for the night; and in his chamber, with his dressinggown&#xD;
about him, and his limbs released in some degree from the gar-&#xD;

not wholly insensible to the good things of th s life,&#xD;
only of the physical enjoyments. Indeed, it is to t&#xD;
chiefly that the "creature comforts~' rise into aramor&#xD;
and estimation. It is when the purer tastes and the pi&#xD;
sires of the mind have been perverted, or abused, or&#xD;
one seeks recompense by appeals to appetites hich, uI&#xD;
are kept in honest subjection. Don Balthazar did not&#xD;
his cigar wholly for' his happiness; a flask o .gener4&#xD;
rested on a table beside him, from which, ever nd aric&#xD;
plenished his goblet. He emptied it, perhaps, uch mc&#xD;

scrupulous exercise, and in their dying embers exerting a&#xD;
and more evil sort of influence in consequence of their very 4e-&#xD;
cay and feebleness. He knew, and felt, and reproached himself&#xD;
at moments for his terrible abuse of authority and advantage&#xD;
the case of his unhappy niece. He was sometimes made con-&#xD;
scious of the awful spectre of his deceased brother, looking do~i~&#xD;
upon him with loathing and anger, and the saddest reproach&#xD;
his face; sometimes he fancied his voice in his ears, and at other&#xD;
times he beheld suddenly, as it were, a glimpse of the fier e&#xD;
visage of "the Biscayan mother" of Olivia, flaming with indign&#xD;
tion, before his eyes. His conscience thus, at times, came to t e&#xD;
assistance of his better reason, and filled him with virtuous res -&#xD;
lution. But it is not easy for one accustomed for thirty yea s&#xD;
to give the full reins to his moods and passions, to re-conqu r&#xD;
them and recover the ascendency of thought and will over habi.&#xD;
Habit is the most unbending of all mortal tyrannies, and the&#xD;
better genius of Don Baithazar struggled, vainly against the 4..&#xD;
petites which he had so constantly fed in its despite. And nob,&#xD;
when some better feelings were endeavoring to assert themselves~&#xD;
in his bosom-when a lingering feeling of commiseration for th~&#xD;
poor child whom he had so cruelly abused had prompted him&#xD;
reflections upon his own selfishness, which, seeking a m.omentar~&#xD;
and even mocking gratification, was destroying the very life of~&#xD;
hope in the bosom of the girl-destroying her peace for ever, anc~&#xD;
all the gladdening impulses which make youth happy-he harden&#xD;
ed himself against the kindlier impression by a recourse to soni~&#xD;
of those hard philosophies, which, in his case, had already over~&#xD;
thrown all the authority as well of humanity as religion.&#xD;
"What matters it," said he to himself; filling his goblet with&#xD;
fresh supply from the wine-flask,-" what matters it in the end~&#xD;
These passions of love are in fact nothing but the caprices of&#xD;
fancy; a brief space will reconcile her to the loss of this knight&#xD;
of Portugal, whose youth, grace, and noble bearing are the only&#xD;
attractions; when he has fairly embarked for Florida she will&#xD;
forget him, and she will then remember me with as much tender-&#xD;
ness as any other lover. She will feel that, though I have&#xD;

wronged her, it was because of my passion that I did sc&#xD;
my love will justify in her mind the exercise of th~ power&#xD;
I had upon her. If not, what is she but a woman, created&#xD;
pleasure and the delight of man; and why should she no&#xD;
ister to my delight as well as to another? Women, i&#xD;
treated, kindly, and without neglect, readily recon~Ale then&#xD;
to the condition from which they cannot escape. She wi]&#xD;
after consent willingly to that which she has 'vainly thot&#xD;
oppose; and in the necessity of her case will become a~&#xD;
what is grateful in it. Already, I think, she begins to in&#xD;
She grows milder every day. For a week shd has ex&#xD;
none of those fitful bursts of passion which she inherited&#xD;
that tigress mother; and her eyes,4hough they ~till lool&#xD;
and reproachfully, show no longer that fierce hate and 1&#xD;
which distinguished them before. She grows pliant-&#xD;
yielding. Let me but baffle this knight of Portugal, an5&#xD;
her wholly in my power. He must depart. She mus&#xD;
his petition; and if not, then I must find a way to siler&#xD;
forever."&#xD;
Don Balthazar deceived himself in one thing. The r&#xD;
of Olivia's present aspect was scarcely in proof that she ~&#xD;
more reconciled to his power than before. We may say&#xD;
place, that she was schooling herself to a more cunning ~&#xD;
that she was opposing art to art, and was never more r&#xD;
against her uncle, than at the moment when she appear&#xD;
resigned to her fate. Her game was to lull to sleep his&#xD;
by appearing more submissive. She was resolved to es~&#xD;
his tyranny as soon as she might hope to do so with safe&#xD;
yet, however, she had formed no deliberate plan for doing&#xD;
had vague projects and purposes in her mind, ill-~I1efined&#xD;
less at present; but, in any scheme, to quiet* hi~ suspic&#xD;
disarm his vigilance, were the first objects, necessary to&#xD;
cess of any other. These, in the end, might ripen into so&#xD;
definite and clear, and in the meantime, her policy wa~&#xD;
and thus far evidently successful. Don Baltha~ar was&#xD;

resignation, on the part of his victim, by which he hoped to en-&#xD;

As thus he lay, weaving conjectures, and hopes and doubts in he&#xD;
most intricate meshes for his own fancy, he Was surprised by a sud-&#xD;
den and most unexpected visitor. But it becomes us to speak of&#xD;
the proceedings' of this visitor, before we formally introduce im&#xD;
to our HidalgQ. We have seen that the fugitive, Mateo, was on&#xD;
his way, pursuing a like rout~ with Don Balthazar, when the p~&#xD;
pearance of the latter drove the outlaw into shelter. He saw s&#xD;
ancient master speed forward, and followed him at his leisu e.&#xD;
A little after nightfall, stationed in a lemon thicket near the dw 11-&#xD;
ing, Mateo gave a signal whistle, and in a few minutes after, ~~as&#xD;
joined by the servant girl, Juana. She was his sister; and, rude&#xD;
and' sullen in her intercourse with all other persons, on him s~hc&#xD;
bestowed nothing but tenderness and affection. Her whole de-&#xD;
portment and character seemed to change on their meeting. ~e&#xD;
clung fondly to his neck; kissed him repeatedly; called him her&#xD;
dear brother, and' would have continued her transports, had me&#xD;
not, with a sort of good-natured violence, 'shaken her off.&#xD;
"That will do, that will do, Juana. There's no time now r&#xD;
kissing and foolishness. I have come for work. What can e&#xD;
done? Is there a good chance? Is there anybody in the hou e,&#xD;
any man body I mean, besides Don Balthazar ?"&#xD;
"No! nobody! There's my young lady, and the old houn~1,&#xD;
Sylvia; and there's the cook and Pedro; but she's in the kitch eia,&#xD;
and Pedro is gone off somewhere. There's nothing to prever~t,&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Well, you must show me a way to get in, and come suddenly&#xD;
upon the old woman. The master's in his room, eh ?"&#xD;
"Yes, he's planning some more wickedness, all to himse f~&#xD;
Even if Sylvia was to cry out, he could hardly hear where he i~;&#xD;
and you needn't go near him at all."&#xD;
"Ay, ay; but I must go n~ar him. I've got some accounts t~&#xD;
settle with*him, now I'm here."&#xD;
"Don't trust yourself with him, dear Mateo. He's got arms&#xD;

He's never unprepared for mischief; and if he sets eyes ci&#xD;
he'll shoot you."&#xD;
"If I don't shoot him: but that's a game that two can p&#xD;
just as well as one; and I hope to take him by surprise. I&#xD;
try to do so. Do n't you fear. I have arms too, just as 'vi&#xD;
he, and I know just as well how to use them; and I'm not&#xD;
of his wickedness. I've got some of my own."&#xD;
"And you will get all the things of poor mainmy'?"&#xD;
"Won't leave a hair for the old hag that robbed you.&#xD;
shall have everything. I'll have them carried off and hid&#xD;
for you, where you can get them when you want them."&#xD;
"But you will carry them with you to the mountains, M&#xD;
"And how will you get the use of them there'?"&#xD;
"Why, ain't I to go along with you, brother'?"&#xD;
"You go along with me'? to the mountains'? Why&#xD;
would you do there, poor child'?"&#xD;
"Why, live with you, and take care of your home for ~&#xD;
"Home !" with a fierce chuckle. "I have no home.&#xD;
never a week in one place together. I pass from mc&#xD;
to mountain; and hide in oi~e cave after another; and go&#xD;
sorts of weather; and~ sleep twenty nights under the op&#xD;
where I sleep once in a human cabin. The outlaw has no&#xD;
no place where he can sleep in safety; except where tI&#xD;
beast keeps watch for him along the mountain-top, and fri&#xD;
off the pursuer.~~&#xD;
"I don't care, Mateo! I am not afraid'! I want to ~&#xD;
you wherever you go, and I'll live with you, and work fi&#xD;
and fight for you, too ;'just us if I were a man and not a W&#xD;

it, and I reckon you're not afraid; but-"&#xD;

"Pooh! Pooh! what of that! Do you suppose if you Kvere&#xD;

"'But I didn't deserve it, Mateo."&#xD;
"Oh! that's all nonsense. Women always deserve a v~rhip~&#xD;

and proper. You don't know when you're well off. With ~me,&#xD;

You'd have to start out of your bed at midnight, to fly, when&#xD;
you hear the bloodhounds barking up the hills. It's sometimes&#xD;
monstrous hard for me to get off. How would it be with y~u?&#xD;
You'd be caught by the dogs. You'd be torn to pieces; or I'd&#xD;
have to risk my own life to save you. Then, if you fell into ~he&#xD;
hands of the hunters, you'd be a thousand times worse off than&#xD;
ever. They'd send you to the Calabooza, and sell you to a h~rd&#xD;
master, who'd put you into the fields, and whip the blood out of&#xD;
your body, and the Ver~y heart out of your bosom. You'r w~ ll&#xD;
off as you are. You've got a good mistress, and a comfortalzjle&#xD;
place, and plenty to eat and drink. But the master beats you,&#xD;
you say. Well, once in a way, perhaps he does; but that d o~s&#xD;
you no harm. I'd have to beat you ten times as much, Juan~i,&#xD;
if you were with me. 'Twould be for your good, I'd do it. I'~l&#xD;
know you wanted it; I know you of old. You'd be the lat&#xD;
person in the world to try and quit this place, if it hadn't spoiled&#xD;
you. You've been treated too well here; 'that's the whole of~&#xD;

would be the very worst thing for you. It's because I love you&#xD;
as my sister, Juana, that I'd rather you'd stay witji the Seflorita,&#xD;
and be honest and quiet. She's good to you, I ktww. No! No!&#xD;
you cannot go with me. Just now, you'd only be in my way,&#xD;
and in the way of danger and all sorts of trouble. But I hope&#xD;

willing, I'll take you off. For the present you must keep v&#xD;

It was in this way that the outlaw answered the entreati4&#xD;
his sister. He, no doubt, came to a right conclusion on th&#xD;
ject. But she was not satisfied, and submitted sullenly&#xD;
authority with which she had-never been accustomed to co&#xD;
" But," she added, as a last argument,-"it's not the Se&#xD;
only ; she's to be married, they say, and there's to be&#xD;
master."&#xD;
"Well: he won't eat you! There can't be any wors&#xD;
Don Balthazar ; and no master in the world will hurt the&#xD;
that sefves him faithfully. He'd be a fool to do it."&#xD;
" But I don't like a new master ; and I donit like to be&#xD;
a master that's a Portuguese."&#xD;
" Ho ! it's orie of the Portuguese that she is to&#xD;
Well, if it's the one that tumbled the handsome cavalier, I&#xD;
de Tobar, she'd be well ~officered. He's a noble soldier,&#xD;
rant-rides a horse, and handles a lance, as if he was m c&#xD;
nothing else. If I were sure that Don Balthazar would 4&#xD;
to the country of the Apalachians, I'd volunteer to go&#xD;
same knight's company. But if he went, he'd be sure&#xD;
me out in time. I could serve such a man as the Port ~&#xD;
and cheerfully acknowledge him my master. Every&#xD;

finds the right one. I like this knight of Portugal. I d&#xD;
what you've got to be afraid of if he marries your lady."&#xD;
" Ah !" said the girl stealthily,-" he'd never marry A r&#xD;
only knew what I know."&#xD;
"What do you know ?-But if it's any harm of her,&#xD;
don't sgy it, for your life. The Senorita, you say, has'&#xD;
been good to you. Don't you turn upon her like a snake.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
"Here be rare plottings. There's more mischief in that one head, and that oily t&#xD;
than in all the country."&#xD;
&#xD;
Tim PAinn&#xD;

nyue,&#xD;
&#xD;
SYLvIA, that arch beldame, as Juana esteemed her, in th ov-&#xD;
ereignty of her domain, below stairs, was, at this moment, the&#xD;
enjoyment of her highest felicity. She had a good suppe be-&#xD;
fore her; her toils of the day were ended, and she was co rat-&#xD;
ulating herself upon the ease and security with which she uld&#xD;
command all the comforts which were necessary to the cre t re.&#xD;
Supper over, she would sleep, and the dreams that. uld&#xD;
follow might reasonably be expected to be all very pleasan~ es.&#xD;
But Fortune plays fine tricks with human securities, an the&#xD;
Fates are always busy to thwart pleasant anticipations; m ing&#xD;
no sort of difference between those of the nobleman and those the&#xD;
drudge. Humble as was Sylvia s secret of happiness, it w des-&#xD;
tined to disappointment; and care nQstled in the cup, the ate-&#xD;
ful beverage of which she was about to carry to her lips, this&#xD;
very moment, the cruel and capricious fortune, in the asp ~t of&#xD;
the mestizo, Mateo, stood quietly behind the old woman, pre ared&#xD;
to cast the sack over her head. Suddenly she felt a rude gripe&#xD;
of huge, strange fingers about her throat, utterly denyi her&#xD;
the privilege to scream ;-almost to breathe I Hardly h d she&#xD;
been thus surprised, when a shaWl was passed about her jaws,&#xD;
effectually shutting out the supper, and just as effectually s cutting&#xD;
in all sound. She strove desperately to shriek, but the voi e died&#xD;
away in a hoarse but faint gurgling in her throat. She was in the&#xD;
hands of an adroit enemy. Mateo was dexterous in his ye tion.&#xD;
He had enjoyed some practice in his outlawed life. The ~ es of&#xD;
the old woman were soon enveloped in another bandage, d as&#xD;

completely denied to see, as her mouth to speak or swallow. A&#xD;
stout cord was then passed about her arms, and thus rendered&#xD;
hors 'lit combat, she might be trusted safely. Every obstack~ was&#xD;
thus removed from the way of the conspirators, and Mateo now&#xD;
gave the signal for the appearance of Juana, who, till this mo-&#xD;
ment, had kept in the background. She was not long in s~ow-&#xD;
ing herself. Mateo, in the meanwhile, coolly took his place at the&#xD;
table which bore the supper of Sylvia, and his appetite bein~ in-&#xD;
vigorated, we may s4pose, by long abstinence and previous toils,&#xD;
he proceeded to its demolition in a manner which would I~ave&#xD;
shocked the true proprietor, could she have seen. She suspected&#xD;
no doubt what was in progress, but there was no remedy. She had&#xD;
to submit with as much resignation as she could command.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Juana was otherwise busied .in making inquest into&#xD;
the secrets of the prison-house. Mateo soon joined her, and the&#xD;
leading purpose of the conspirators was soon made apparent.&#xD;
There were closets thrown wide, and boxes torn open. All~the&#xD;
goods and chattels, the accumulations of old Anita, to whichSyl-&#xD;
via had so quietly succeeded, were brought out from their hid-&#xD;
ing-places. One may conjecture the variety of treasures which&#xD;
had been accumulated by both these ancient beldames, in- the&#xD;
course of half a century of peculation. B~it the details must be&#xD;
left to conjecture. Our purpose is not a catalogue. Mateo and&#xD;
Juana were equally busy. The latter knew where to look, and the&#xD;
former how to secure. His machete did good service in forci~ig&#xD;
open boxes; and every sack whiclA could be found, was appro-&#xD;
priated to the compact accumulation of the scattered treasures.&#xD;
Slung upon the broad, strong shoulders of the outlaw, they dis-&#xD;
appeared one by one; transferred, in brief space, from the house&#xD;
to the adjoining woods, where, it seems, the mestizo haa season-&#xD;
ably provided a sort of cart for their better conveyance to other&#xD;
hiding~places. The work was done by a practiced hand, and very&#xD;
effectually; /&#xD;
Sylvia could readily conjecture what was going on, but she was*&#xD;
only able to groan and grieve internally. She did not remain&#xD;
passive, however, and rose up, blinded and muzzled, and cord~d&#xD;

as she ~vas, with more than one effort to interfere. It was (&#xD;
by one or two emphatic exhortations from the heavy fists I&#xD;
outlaw, that she was persuaded of the better policy of submi I&#xD;
without farther struggles, to her-fate.&#xD;
Supposing this work to be fairly over, and Mateo in full&#xD;
session of all his mother's chattels; perhaps of others also&#xD;
which that amiable woman could never assert any claim, th~&#xD;
law found it becoming to transfer his attentions to another&#xD;
household. His next work was with the master.&#xD;
We have seen that Don Balthazar de Alvaro was dispo4&#xD;
indulge in a somewhat meditative mood; one, however, in&#xD;
conscience was allowed to play only a subordinate part to&#xD;
ophy. The pleasant fumes of the cigar, the grateful poten~&#xD;
the wine-flask, the genial sweet~aess of the climate~ had tog~&#xD;
as we have seen, induced finally a very grateful condition z~I&#xD;
ery, in which tl~e thoughts of the mind accommodated them~~&#xD;
with a rare condescension, to the humors of the body. Th&#xD;
sult was a condition of complacent happiness, which was'st4i&#xD;
of all apprehensions. There were no clouds in his sky, th~&#xD;
could perceive; and for the troubles of his hearth, it was&#xD;
uprising how slight they seemed, and how soon they were&#xD;
perused, as he meditated his good fortune, his own resources&#xD;
brought the energies of his will to bear upon the future. I&#xD;
only to get Philip de Vasconselos out of his path ;-and fo&#xD;
object he had several schemes, even if the love-sick damsel &amp;amp;&#xD;
fail to assert her virtuous resolution to reject him ;-to get (&#xD;
out to her plantation, and under proper surveillance there&#xD;
then for the gold regions of the Apalachian, and one or twc&#xD;
paigns. His ambition was not asleep during all these specula&#xD;
His appetites demanded free floods of gold; he required c~&#xD;
red men for ~laves; he had fancies of royal favor, and did n&#xD;
why he, too, should not become the Adelantado of newly-d&#xD;

THE REVERY DISTURBED.                 ~73&#xD;
after slaves as conquest; after love, or lust, as in the soul-sttirv-&#xD;
ing search after gold. Don Baithazar, reclined on his cane sofa,&#xD;
head thrown back, cigar in mouth, and wine-flask at his elbc~w,&#xD;
was in the enjoyment of a great variety of very grateful antici-&#xD;
pations. How the coldest and sternest of men may becofne&#xD;
dreamers, it is scarcely necessary to insist, with the experienced&#xD;
reader.&#xD;
It was the very moment when his dreaming mood was m~st&#xD;
active, and most serenely secure in the possession of the m9st&#xD;
teeming fancies, that Mateo, the outlaw, chose for appearing[in&#xD;
the presence of the knight. Now, we must do the mestizo ~he&#xD;
justice to say that it was no part of his design to disperse tue&#xD;
pleasant fancies of the Don, or to overthrow the castles of delight&#xD;
and strength which his imagination was erecting. To Mateo~ it&#xD;
would be of no sort of moment, how wildly, or how pleasantly,&#xD;
the knight might dream. He might smile contemptuously&#xD;
upon such employment, but that he should deliberately set him-&#xD;
self in hostility to the worker for their overthrow, is really not&#xD;
to be thought of. Bad fellow as he undoubtedly was, Mateo&#xD;
was not so malicious. He had very different, and more sol~d&#xD;
purposes. If, in his prosecution of these, the dreams of Don&#xD;
Balthazar happened to be dispersed, the evil was unintended;&#xD;
and, we have no doubt, if properly apprised of what he had uh-&#xD;
wittingly done, he would have expressed his devout contrition.&#xD;
Certainly he little conjectured of what a golden domain he dis-&#xD;
possessed his ancient master in the course of a very little spa~e&#xD;
of time.&#xD;
Mateo entered the apartment of the Hidalgo without disturl5-&#xD;
ing his revery. He did not enter, after the fashion of ordinary&#xD;
visitorss , through the door. Mateo was no ordinary outlaw. Not&#xD;
that he preferred the more laborious process of ascending a&#xD;
column of the verandah and climbing in through the window.&#xD;
But simply because the door was bolted on the inside. DoA&#xD;
Balthazar was a man of precautions-a politician who knew that&#xD;
reveries were not properly to be enjoyed, unless with all reasons-&#xD;
able securities first taken. That he left his window unfastened~&#xD;

which opened upon the verandah, was simply to admjt the br eze,&#xD;
and he never once fancied that his reveries could render him&#xD;
oblivious to the approach of any less light-footed visitor. lie&#xD;
was mistaken. Mateo made his way in, without disturbing his&#xD;
sense of security. Not that he was not heard. Don Bait azar&#xD;
was sejisible to the rustling of the orange-tree beside the v ran-&#xD;
dah; he heard the branches scrape rather roughly upo the&#xD;
column. But that might be occasioned by the puff of wind that&#xD;
smote just then gratefully over his brow and bosom; a~d so&#xD;
believing, his eyes were shut, and the thick volume of s~noke&#xD;
went up from his cigar,~increasing in mass as the exciting yision&#xD;
~of future lordships in Florida rose before his imagination.&#xD;
On a sudden he was awakened to full consciousness. His&#xD;
atmosphere grew heavier. It seemed as if his fancies founc~ ~some&#xD;
obstruction, and could no longer spread their wings as fre4ly as&#xD;
before. He felt as if there were some antagonist influence ~n his&#xD;
sky, which had suddenly darkened all his bright stars. An~ this&#xD;
consciousness certainly preceded the opening of his eyes.~ He&#xD;
had not yet opened them, when his ears were saluted w4h the&#xD;
tones of a strange speaker, and in language well calcu1a~ed to&#xD;
startle and drive him from his world of visions.&#xD;
"Well, I must say, your Excellency, that you are very com-&#xD;
fortable here.''&#xD;
We have preferred putting the patois of our mestiz~ into&#xD;
tolerably correct language, taking for granted that the i'eader&#xD;
will readily suppose that there were certain differences between&#xD;
the speech of the outlaw and his superior. This will sufi~Ice for&#xD;
expJanation. We have no taste for that sort of literature which&#xD;
makes the vulgar speak viciously, when what they have ~o say&#xD;
can as well be said in tolerable phrase and grammar.&#xD;
Don Balthazar forgot to smoke. The cigar dropped fr~nn his&#xD;
opening lips. His eyes enclosed. His head was partly ~raised.&#xD;
Never did visage more express ~onfpunding wonderment. There,&#xD;
quietly seated on the settee directly opposite, was the ~utlaW,&#xD;
whom he had given it in charge to his alguazib to arrest. How&#xD;
caine he there ~ Was he not in bonds? Were the algu~~zils in&#xD;

waiting? They had probably taken the fugitive, and were at&#xD;
hand. All these conjectures, and many others, passed through&#xD;
the brain of the Hidalgo in a single moment of time. But they&#xD;
were dismissed as rapidly as conceived. The outlaw h4d no&#xD;
appearance of constraint. He looked rather like a conqueror&#xD;
than a captive. There were no chains about his body or his&#xD;
wrist. Never sat mortal so perfectly at his ease, his great bulk&#xD;
covering half of the slight cane settee of which he had taken pos-&#xD;
session. There was a good-natured mockery, too, in his face,&#xD;
that betrayed no sense of inconvenience. It was evident~ at a&#xD;
second glance, that he was not only n6 prisoner, but not a~are,&#xD;
himself; of any risk of becoming one. There was a great knife&#xD;
in his belt, conspicuous, which the eyes of Don Balthazar fastened&#xD;
upon. It was the very weapon with which the matador had slain&#xD;
the bull. The Don began to feel uneasy.&#xD;
"Who i~ that?" he inquired; though he need not have done&#xD;
so; for he knew the intruder the instant he set eyes upon h~m.&#xD;
"Don't your Excellency know ?"&#xD;
"No !-who?"&#xD;
"Your Excellency has a bad memory for old acquaintance.&#xD;
Don't you remember Mateo, that once belonged to the estate of&#xD;
Don Felix?"&#xD;
"You?"&#xD;
"Yes, Selior, the same! I was a bad fellow, you know, and&#xD;
wouldn't work. Work don't suit me. If it hadn't been for that,&#xD;
I'd have kept on the estate forever, for I rather liked the place,&#xD;
and the living was very good. But it's too hard to have to work&#xD;
for the bread one eats, and I always preferred to take it where I&#xD;
could get it without work. I don't object to other people doing&#xD;
all the work they can. It's necessary, perhaps ;--some mu~t do&#xD;
it, indeed, where all must feed; but I am for leaving it to those&#xD;
that like it. I don't like it, and as long as I can get my bread~&#xD;
without digging for it, I'll do so."&#xD;
" You killed Pedro Gutierrez'?"&#xD;
"Exactly: because he would make me wt)rk! It was all his&#xD;
fault. I warned him that I wouldn't work; that it didn't agree&#xD;

followed; and he got the worst of them. If he was kille , he&#xD;
brought it on his own' head."&#xD;
"You are a murderer, and an outlaw."&#xD;
"Good words, your Excellency,-good words! What's th~ use&#xD;
0f fouling your Excellency's mouth with bad ones? I don't care&#xD;
much about words at any time; but sometimes they make me&#xD;
angry. I don't want to be angry now, as I'm in a special good&#xD;
bumor, and there's no need to quarrel with old acquaintance. I&#xD;
have not seen you so long that it does me real good to look upon&#xD;
you. Your Excellency don't seem to be much changed. There's&#xD;
a little more of the salt in your hair, 'your Excellency, and it&#xD;
shows a little in your beard, now that you let it grow so long.&#xD;
You should use some of our black root die, which will make the&#xD;
hair as young as when you were only twenty!"&#xD;
The blood of the knight was boiling in his veins. But he tried&#xD;
to be cool, and with great apparent calmness, said-&#xD;
"Do you know, Mateo, that if you are once taken you will be&#xD;
garoted without trial ?"&#xD;
"One must take the tiger, your Excellency, before you can&#xD;
araw his teeth."&#xD;
"But they will take you! You cannot resist a dozen men-.&#xD;
a troop-an army. Now, I happen to know that you have been&#xD;
heard of in Havana, and that the alguazils are in search of&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Ah! well'! They will hardly look for me here, your Excel-&#xD;
lency, and I shall not be here very long. I shall soon be off for&#xD;
1~he mountains. Meanwhile, I must take my choice. Aighazils&#xD;
~re very fine trencher men, but scarcely of much account where&#xD;
the only feed is steel and bullet. I shall probably escape from&#xD;
these of Havana."&#xD;
"But what brings you here now?"&#xD;
"Well, you're something concerned in the affair, though per.&#xD;

"I rather think your Excellency ought to know, since you've&#xD;
been promising the old woman to get me pardoned for a long&#xD;
time past. I suppose you had good reasons for not keeping your&#xD;
promise."&#xD;
"Yes; your mother knew. I told her that no pardon was&#xD;
possible until you should come in."&#xD;
"Very clear, your Excellency; and' noW that Pve come in,&#xD;
you tell me that t~he algua7ils are already looking after m~, and&#xD;
that I shall be garoted if caught. How do the two stories tally,&#xD;
your Excellency ?"&#xD;
"To come in and surrender, is quite a different thing from&#xD;
coming in as you do now.~~                      fJ~r&#xD;
Perhaps so; but it don't matter much any way. As my&#xD;
surrender, your Excellency, before I have the pardon und~r the&#xD;
seal of the king's governor, it's not to be talked of; it's so fool-&#xD;
ish."&#xD;
"Then what brings you now? "&#xD;
"Ah! I was tellir~ you. My mother died, your Excellency;&#xD;
very suddenly, nobody knows how. I hear that she was poisoned,&#xD;
Senior."&#xD;
"From whom do you hear this?"&#xD;
"That's not necessary to be said. She was poisoned, and I&#xD;
have to find out the poisoner and settle with him "-here he&#xD;
handled h's machete. "It's his blood or mine, your Excelle~icy2'&#xD;
This w s said with significant emphasis, and such a look as&#xD;
~showed t e Don that he himself was the object of suspicion.&#xD;
"But s ppose she was poisoned by a woman&#xD;
"Then it's only a little harder upon my conscience, and I must&#xD;
use a sm ller knife than this. But what woman, your Excel-&#xD;

"Nay, do not know by whom the deed was done. I have a&#xD;

"Your Excellency's suspicions are like to be as good as another&#xD;

man to let my mother be baited, like a dog we hate, with poison-&#xD;
e4 beef. Your Excellency will find it necessary to give me help&#xD;
in this discovery. You have not done right by me. You let&#xD;
this woman Sylvia take possession of all my mother's property."&#xD;
"Property! Why, what property had your mother? She&#xD;
was a slave I"&#xD;
"Yes, by the laws, I know; but your Excellency knows I&#xD;
don't mind laws, and have my own. Now, I have already taken&#xD;
possession of all my mother's property97'&#xD;
"The devil you have !"&#xD;
"Exact~ly; I took possession just an hour ago. I tied up the&#xD;
old hag below-"&#xD;
"You have not murdered the woman&#xD;
* "No! Only tied her up, hand and tongue. You will find&#xD;
her after I am gone rather stiff in her limbs~ and feeling the want&#xD;
of her supper, which I have eaten. The goods I have carried* off&#xD;
already, and the plunder, were worth having, I assure you. There&#xD;
will be fine sights of treasure in the mountains when I get back."&#xD;
The knight grew more and more uneasy. The cool insolence&#xD;
of the outlaw was almost intolerable. He looked about him&#xD;
with impatience, and his eyes turned involuntarily to the wall&#xD;
upon which he had hung his sword and dagger. To his surprise,&#xD;
they were gone. How had they been taken away? It was evi-&#xD;
dent that Mateo had been in the chamber already that night, or&#xD;
some emissary; and he found himself completely in the power&#xD;
of the ruffian. Pon Balthazar did not lack for courage; but the&#xD;
gigantic frame of his companion discouraged at a glance the mo-&#xD;
mentary impulse which he felt suddenly to spring upon and&#xD;
grapple with him; and he now gazed upon the person whom he&#xD;
feared with an eye of vacancy. Mateo seemed to read his&#xD;
thoughts. He had followed his glance to where the weapons had&#xD;
been wont to hang, and divined his feelings. The outlaw laughed&#xD;
securely, with a bold, honest chuckle of security and triumph.&#xD;
"'Twont do, your Excellency; the game's in my hand. I&#xD;

could make any music out of it. But that's not what I want to&#xD;

own," cried the outlaw imperatively, and putting his&#xD;
ds knife. "You can talk, and I can hear just as well&#xD;
Ii of us sit."&#xD;
ou think I mean to harm you ?"&#xD;
no! that you can't. I could settle your accounts in a&#xD;

make others work, and I know as well as any man how the work&#xD;
ought to be done. Try me, and you shall see. If you had tried&#xD;
me before instead of putting a blind bull over me, you'd have&#xD;
done better, and Pedro Gutierrez would never have had his skull&#xD;
opened suddenly, to his great disgrace showing that he had no&#xD;
brains in the shell. Many a man don't do, and won't do, because&#xD;
the right work is not given him, and the right confidence. Now,&#xD;
do you try me, and you'll see what I can do. Make me your&#xD;
overseer, get my pardon made out with the royal seal, and give&#xD;
my sister to live with me, and you will find Mateo as faithful as&#xD;
a dog. Refuse me, and you keep me the tiger and the outlaw&#xD;
that you have made ~&#xD;
Rapid were the thoughts which coursed through the knight's&#xD;
brain. The philosophy of the outlaw began to strike him favor.&#xD;
ably. He reflected-" This fellow can be bought. He will do~&#xD;
any service in return for these things. He will strike my foe,&#xD;
as coolly as butcher smites ox; he will obey my finger with-&#xD;
out questioning. I leave for Florida. Olivia retires to the ha.&#xD;
cienda. There, he is supreme in my absence. Ah! well! I&#xD;
see 1"&#xD;
Then aloud:&#xD;
"'Pon, my soul, Mateo, you are moderate in your wishes.&#xD;
But suppose I comply with them ~&#xD;
"It will be wise!"&#xD;
"Perhaps so! But are you prepared to show your ~devotion&#xD;
to him who will ck for you all this ?"&#xD;
"Am I prepared to make a profitable bargain ~"&#xD;
"Suppose there be a hateful serpent in my path ?"&#xD;
"I will put my heel upon his head !"&#xD;
"Suppose there be a wolf in my dose ?"&#xD;
"I will put my knife across his throat I"&#xD;
"A mad bull, fierce as El Moro, and as strong 'I"&#xD;
"Here is the very machete that slew El Moro !"&#xD;
"It shall be done! Fill yourself a cup of wine, and we will&#xD;
speak farther of 'this matter. We understand each other. It is&#xD;
a bargain between us!"&#xD;

IT will not ~e difficult to conjecture what werethe terms which Don&#xD;
Balthazar w~s prepared to make with the outlaw, or the character&#xD;
of t e services which the latter was to ~render, by which to se-&#xD;

equally faiii~g to suggest considerations of doubt to a very ductile&#xD;
conscience. Strange to say, the conditions which he demanded&#xD;
of the outlaw, were not so readily accepted by this person.&#xD;
Mateo was tiot without his own rude virtues. He had been im-&#xD;
pressed wit~ the knightly graces and ~yalor of Vasconselos-had&#xD;
seen with d~dight his wonderful skill in the tournament, and had&#xD;
hailed his ~uccesses as if he shared in them. Besides, he was&#xD;
aware of th~ isolation of the Portuguese cavalier,'and well knew&#xD;
the reluctance with which the Spaniards had acknowledged his su-&#xD;
periority. iMlateo had too little of the Spanish blood in him to&#xD;
feel with th m, and adversely to one whose isolation so much re-&#xD;
minded him of his own; and he gave him his sympathies on this&#xD;
account, as ell as because of his valiant bearing. But he was&#xD;
a person in situation which did not suffer him to withstand the&#xD;
tempter; a d, though slowly and reluctantly, he, at length, yield-&#xD;

ed to the temptation. He was bought by the promise of' par.&#xD;
to become the as-&#xD;
don, and the hope of reward; and consented&#xD;
sassin of the knight of Portugal. That night lie confided the&#xD;
whole secret to his sister, Juana, expecting her to be gratified&#xD;
with an arrangement which promised him security and trust, and&#xD;
freedom to herself. But he was confounded to find that she saw&#xD;
the affair in a very different aspect.&#xD;
"Don't you believe Don Balthazar, my brother!" said the&#xD;
girl. "He has some snare for your feet. It was because you&#xD;
had him in your power that he made this bargain with you. He&#xD;
keeps terms with no one; and I am only afraid that he throws&#xD;
dust in your eyes, while he puts the alguazils upon your foot-&#xD;
steps! Besides, you dc~&amp;amp;t know what a noble gentleman this&#xD;
knight of Portugal is."&#xD;
"Don't I, then? Haven't I seen him with lance and sword;&#xD;
on horse and foot; and do~i't I know how these Spaniards hate and&#xD;
fear him? Jesu! It did my heart good to see how he carried him.&#xD;
self ;-how he managed the horse and lance, and made the sword&#xD;
fly, here and there, at every point in the heavens, wherever the&#xD;
enemy attacked. Oh! but I do know him, and I was very loth&#xD;
to promise to lift knife against his breast 1"&#xD;
"And why did you do it?"&#xD;
"Demonios! What was I to do? Here was my own pardon&#xD;
offered me, your freedom, and the whole charge of the hacienda."&#xD;
"You will get none of these! Don Balthazar means only to&#xD;
betray thee. He wishes, no doubt, to get this knight of Por-&#xD;
tugal out of his way; for there are precious reasons, my brother,&#xD;
why he should fear the presence of the Portuguese. Ah! if thou&#xD;
knew'st! But when thou hast done the service, then will he be&#xD;
the first to denounce thee. He is a bitter traitor. His whole&#xD;
life is a treachery. His heart i~ full of serpents. He has lied&#xD;
tc~ thee with sweetness, and thou hast tasted of the sweetness&#xD;

the hours w en to steal forth, but hither will I come to sleep.&#xD;
Dost thou hear ?"&#xD;
"Yes! It is best, perhaps. The plan is a good one. But&#xD;
thou wilt not kill this knight of Portugal to pleasure this bad&#xD;
man?"&#xD;
"It must be done! I will do as I have said; and if Don Bal-&#xD;
thazar, then, does not as he hath sworn to me, I will cut out his&#xD;
lying tongue, and he shall see me eat it ere he dies !".&#xD;
We need ot farther pursue the conference, which ended in an&#xD;
arrangement~ by which the outlaw, unknown to any but Juana,&#xD;
was to find ~is nightly refuge, in the groves and harboring places&#xD;
belonging tq the grounds of the knight's own dwelling, and be&#xD;
supplied with food at. her hands. He was also to time carefully&#xD;
his moments~ of sallying forth; and it-~was deemed only a proper&#xD;
precaution that Don Balthazar was not to know where he har-&#xD;
bored, or be permitted any knowledge of his movements; at all&#xD;
events, until it was certain that Juana's suspicions were ground-&#xD;
less.&#xD;

* the thick groves by which it was environed. While it was in&#xD;
progress, Doi~ Balthazar contrived to find his way into the do-&#xD;
main of Sylvia, and free her from her unpleasant bandagings.&#xD;
He affected great surprise at her condition, and gave her no clues&#xD;
to the secret of it. Nor, while he was present, did she conjec-&#xD;
ture who was the bold ruffian by whom she had been plundered.&#xD;
But scarcely had the knight retired, when she received a gleam&#xD;
of intelligence from a simple* discovery enough. The bandage&#xD;
about her eyes was a scarf which she had often seen in the pos.&#xD;
session of Juana-that, or one very much like it. Now, where&#xD;
one is disposed to dislike, or suspect, the proofs rapidly accumu-&#xD;
late. This discovery, though by no means conclusive-since the&#xD;
ruffian might very well have caught up, and made use of; the scarf&#xD;
of the innocent serving-maid-yet set the memories and wits of&#xD;
old Sylvia busy. She saw the mystery at a glance. Was not&#xD;
Mateo the brother of Juana ;-was not Mateo an outlaw ;-and&#xD;
had she not heard that Mateo had been seen in the bull-fight,&#xD;
and that her excellent master-ever to be honored-had actually&#xD;
set certain alguazils upon his footsteps '~ Nay, did not Don Bal-&#xD;
thazar, only two nights before; give her warning to keep a close&#xD;
eye upon Juana, for that the outlaw, her brother, was at hand?&#xD;
And, 0, shame to her prudence, had she not been t&amp;amp;o careless&#xD;
of this counsel; ~and was it not for this very incautiousness that&#xD;
she had fallen a victim to the robber! Now it was that she&#xD;
remembered the frequent stealthy absences of the girl at night-&#xD;
her window open-her chamber empty-and a hundred other&#xD;
matters; which, in her present keen suspicions, were proofs like&#xD;
holy writ-confirmations strong-not to be gainsayed in any&#xD;
court of justice.&#xD;
Sylvia was resolved, in her suspicions. They were clear&#xD;
enough as proofs, "And now," mused the sagacious old woman,&#xD;
"how to recover my property-how to enjoy my revenges! I&#xD;
see through the whole affair. Juana harbors her brother here!&#xD;
Truly, a m~bst excellent notion, that of making the house of the&#xD;
1*&#xD;
most noble knight, Don Balthazar, the place of refuge for the&#xD;
&#xD;
very outlaw whom he has sent the alguazils to find! But I will&#xD;
be toQ much for them both-they shall see! they shall see !"&#xD;
Her plan were soon devised, and the very next morning,&#xD;
bright ~nd e rly, she sallied forth on some professedly innocent&#xD;
pretences. e need not follow her footsteps, but content our-&#xD;
selves with +eportingin brief; the object of her expedition. It&#xD;
was to seek ~ut the alguazils-the chief of them, rather-and be-&#xD;
stow upon him the benefit of her discovery. She made an effort&#xD;
to see Don J~althazar, and to enlighten him on the subject; but,&#xD;
to her surprise, he seemed to have left the hacienda after reliev-&#xD;
ing her of her bonds. He did. not again, that night, occupy his&#xD;
own chamber ; possibly, because of its assumed insecurity; and&#xD;
during the day following, he did not re-appear. He was busy&#xD;
in the city.&#xD;
Meanwhile ~3, what of Olivia-the poor victim, torn by love on&#xD;
the one hand, by a bitter consciousness of wrong and shame on&#xD;
h&#xD;
the other; .~.y passions which she could not control, by fears&#xD;
which she d5ed not name; by vague, vain hopes, which fluc-&#xD;
tuated in a ~ort of shadowy existence in her soul, keeping her&#xD;
restless, dreaming of possibilities, and the most moQking fancies,&#xD;
which left heY', half the time, in the greatest uncertainty of reason!&#xD;
Bier health seemed to improve, however, and, though pale and&#xD;
sad as ever, there were symptoms of better spirits and a greater&#xD;
cheerfulness. Love itself was her only stimulant, while it was&#xD;
also one of her most disturbing griefs. The image of Philip do&#xD;
Vasconselos was ever present to her imagination, coming always&#xD;
clothed with promise. The more she reflected upon the proba-&#xD;
bility of his addressing her, the more she began to doubt of her&#xD;
own strength to say him nay. But, even then, her conscience&#xD;
smote her w~th the criminality of consent; and she would thus&#xD;
sink back into hopelessness and sorrow. But why was it that&#xD;
he came not? To this inquiry, which again suggested a painful&#xD;
doubt of her conquest-painful still, though she had resolved to&#xD;
reject his suit-her lively friend, Leonora de Tobar, brought a&#xD;
sufficiently- explanatory answer. He was close in attendance&#xD;
upon, and anxious for the safety of; his sick brother. Now, hew-&#xD;

ever, that Andres was out of danger, Olivia might look to see&#xD;
him soon. She spent that morning with the* unhappy damsel,&#xD;
and her lively prattle alternately cheered and depressed her.&#xD;
When she was gone, Olivia made her toilet with more than&#xD;
usual care. Why? The words ot~ Leonora assured her that she&#xD;
might surely look for Don Philip's coming soon-that very day,&#xD;
perhaps; and it was with~an interest which the poor girl dared&#xD;
not acknowledge to herself; that she arrayed her charms to the&#xD;
best possible advantage; and gazed with a sorrowful sort, of sat-&#xD;
isfaction into the mirror which reflected them to her eyes. Then&#xD;
she sighed, with the sudden rush of her fancies from the seat of&#xD;
conscience, rebuked by the stern judgment of that sacred mon-&#xD;
itor.&#xD;
"Wherefore," she murmured to herself; " wherefore this&#xD;
beauty-this solicitude to appear beautiful in his eyes? Alas!&#xD;
my soul; I cannot do him this great dishonor. I can never&#xD;
doom his noble heart to such infamy as embrace of me will&#xD;
bring I"&#xD;
She sank away from the mirror-she threw herself upon her&#xD;
couch, and buried her face within her hands. The next moment&#xD;
the girl, Juana, was gazing upon her with a look of sympathizing&#xD;
interest, which touched her soul, The girl looked into the cham-&#xD;
ber only to disappear.&#xD;
"Madre de Dios I" Olivia murmured to herself: "Can it be&#xD;
that she knows-that she suspects ?"&#xD;
And with the doubt, the apprehension grew to terror.&#xD;
"I am at the mercy, 0! Heavens, of the meanest slave !"&#xD;
The fear was followed by an agonizing burst of grief! The&#xD;
day was one of perpetual doubts and apprehensions. But it&#xD;
passed away without events. Yasconselos did not appear, as&#xD;
Leonora haa conjectured, and as Olivia had hoped-and feared!&#xD;
Her doubts and fears grew strengthened. If her secret was in&#xD;
the possession of the slave, Juana, it was a secret no longer!&#xD;
That it should have reached the ears of Philip, was her neW&#xD;
terror! It prostrated her for awhile! Half the night was passed&#xD;
in tears and terrors, which were so many agonies. She could&#xD;
&#xD;
bear his loss-she coul4 be content to give him up forever-but&#xD;
that he should know her shame; that his noble soul should be.&#xD;
come conscious of the deadly stain upon hers-that she could&#xD;
never bear, ~nd live! She prayed for death. In her secret&#xD;
thought arose a vague feeling, which brought, and commended&#xD;
to her, the fatal poison, with which, unwittingly, her hand had&#xD;
bestowed death . upon Anita. Were there not other drops of&#xD;
silence, and sleep, and safety in that fat~d phial? Where was it?&#xD;
She would look for it~! She would find it, and at the worst, she&#xD;
would sleep; and all these terrible agonies of thought would&#xD;
have an end I In the deep stillness of the midnight hour, the&#xD;
unhappy damsel resolved on suicide. But there were other&#xD;
drops of bitterness in her cup of misery, which she was yet to&#xD;
drink to the dregs. Let us not anticipate, but follow the fortunes&#xD;
of other persons of our drama.&#xD;
Sylvia had made her way to the alguazils, and had put them&#xD;
in possession of all the clues which she had procured, leading to&#xD;
the pathways and hiding-places of the outlaw, Mateo. Once&#xD;
roused to suspicion, she had found numerous reasons for con-&#xD;
firming her in her conjectures. She noted all the outgoing of&#xD;
Juana. She watched her with secrecy, and comparative success;&#xD;
and though she di not see Mateo, she yet arrived at a very&#xD;
shrewd notion of th thickets in which he might be found. The&#xD;
hacienda which Do Balthazar and his niece occupied, though&#xD;
* smaller than the est te which he cultivated for her, was yet one&#xD;
of considerable rang in grove and forest. It had numerous dim&#xD;
avenues of shade an silence. There were solitary walks which&#xD;
no one frequented. here were hollows among the wooded hills&#xD;
which might have harbored a hermit. It seems that Mateo&#xD;
knew the place. 'H possessed himself( of its various haunts;&#xD;
and, but for the too ager desire of Juana to seek him out, and&#xD;
be with him 'i~rhen t ere was no necessity for it, the old woman&#xD;
would probably nev r have gifessed his propinquity. had the&#xD;
girl been content to seek him only at night, and to carry him&#xD;
food but once in the wenty-four hours, and then under cover of&#xD;
the darkness, he had een safe. But the girl loved her brother,&#xD;

&#xD;
and was very proud of his prowess. Besides, after the death of&#xD;
Anita, she needed the solace of association with the only kinsman&#xD;
left her. She gratified this desire, and sought to gratify him,&#xD;
twenty times a day, perhaps; stealing forth with Ifruits and deli.&#xD;
cacies, with nice morsels from the kitchen, and with an occasional&#xD;
wine-flask, or the remains of one, whenever she could appropri.&#xD;
ate it with impunity. But the eye of Sylvia was upon her; and&#xD;
she noted the direction taken by the footsteps of the girl. It was&#xD;
surprising with what correctness she conjectured the harboring&#xD;
places of the fugitive, from these observations, and her own&#xD;
knowledge of the grounds. She put all her clues into the keep.&#xD;
ing of the alguazils. The result was, that before sunset, some&#xD;
half dozen of them were quietly skirting the hacienda, divided&#xD;
into two parties, and gradually contracting their circuits about&#xD;
the suspected place of refuge.&#xD;
Mateo, meanwhile, never dreamed of danger from this source.&#xD;
It is true that Juana had her doubts of the good faith of Don&#xD;
Balthazar, and labored to inspire him with similar doubts. In&#xD;
some degree she succeeded, so as in fact to make him circum-&#xD;
spect as possible. But the great gain of security, of freedom,&#xD;
and high trust, which the Hidalgo had promised, were considera-&#xD;
tions quite too grateful and tempting not to prevail in the argu-&#xD;
ment addressed to the confidence of the outlaw; who, besides,&#xD;
seemed to understand very well why the uncle of Olivia should&#xD;
desire to get Don Philip de Vasco~nselos removed from the path.&#xD;
It was nZt with any satisfaction that Mateo contemplated the&#xD;
duty assigned him. He would rather have killed any two other&#xD;
men in Havana than this one Portuguese. L~ut, as he said,&#xD;
"What am I to do? I can't be a fugitive always, flying for safe.&#xD;
ty; and to be my own master is a great deal to one who don't&#xD;
like to work; and to get into a snug office, where I can compel&#xD;
others to do the thing which I don't like to do myself, is certainly&#xD;
very pleasant! Besides, if I don't take the Portuguese in hand,&#xD;
Don Balthazar will only employ somebody else-some bungler,&#xD;
who will not do it half so well; who will botch the business;&#xD;
who will give the good knight unnecessary pain, and perhaps&#xD;
&#xD;
keep him lingering.&#xD;
but a stroke over&#xD;
angels; for he is a&#xD;
to die! It must b&#xD;
beware how he p1&#xD;
Philip, whom I rat&#xD;

In this state of&#xD;

Philip de Vasconselos had taken this very&#xD;
damsel whom his admiring fancies had chosen&#xD;
tournament. The duty would have been&#xD;

ery contradictory. Philip, though anxious,&#xD;

Nuno de Tobar, that she was at length well&#xD;
suitors; and he had chosen the most delicious&#xD;

the modesty of his character could not be deceived on a subject&#xD;
on which the common voice of society allowed no doubts, and he&#xD;
was resolved to bring his own doubts, if any, to a close, as soon&#xD;
as possible, and terminate a condition of suspense which had&#xD;
many vexations. But, whether he should address Olivia that&#xD;
evening or not, was to depend upon his reception, her health? and&#xD;
other circumstances which need not b9 mentioned. Enough,&#xD;
that he is at last on his way to her hacienda.&#xD;
He had just entered upon the estate, and, with slow step, and&#xD;
musing spirit, was penetrating the avenue of great trees which&#xD;
led to the dwelling, when he was startled from a pleasant revery,&#xD;
by a sudden outcry from the depths of the thicket on his right.&#xD;
There were clamors, as of threatened violence; the shouts of man&#xD;
to man; a rushing and crackling afriong the shrubs and branches&#xD;
of the wood, followed by a fierce, wild, savage oath or two,&#xD;
which came very distinctly to his ears, and which declared for&#xD;
angry passions ready to do mischief. The suit set. The in-&#xD;
terval of twilight is brief in that region. A sudden glory suffuses&#xD;
the sky, as the great eye of day is about to close; the glory&#xD;
disappears, a faint misty light lingers in the sky; which gradually&#xD;
deepe~is into dusk. Such was the hour. The dusk was nearly&#xD;
darkness in the wood; and, for a moment, Don Philip could&#xD;
see nothing, though he impulsively took a few steps into the&#xD;
thicket in order to trace the secret of the outcry. He was not&#xD;
left long in doubt. Suddenly, a gigantic figure, that seemed to rise&#xD;
from the earth where he had fallen, bounded close beside him.&#xD;
He was followed by ,three others, who now rushed out of the&#xD;
wood and made after the fugitive, armed with swords and knives.&#xD;
They were close upon his heels, and he turned about to confront&#xD;
them. Three upon one! The struggle was too unequal. The&#xD;
chivalry of Don Philip was aroused as he beheld. With the natu-&#xD;
ral impulse of a brave man, sympathizing with the weak, he&#xD;
drew his~ sword, and threw himself in the way of the pursuers;&#xD;
the outlaw, for it was he, being some twenty steps in advance.&#xD;
"Stand aside I,' cried one of the alguazils, who seemed to be&#xD;
the leader :-~" we are officers of justice."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I know not that&#xD;
rant? Let me see&#xD;

nations with the Adelantado, and how small his popularity with&#xD;
the Spaniards at large.&#xD;
"You are right," said he to the officers; "I have nothing to&#xD;
do with this business !" and he turned aside, and put up his&#xD;
weapon. The alguazils started again in pursuit. A shrill whis-&#xD;
tle sounded from the opposite quarter. It was the signal of the&#xD;
other party in search of the fugitive. The outlaw was between&#xD;
two squads of enemies, and he hounded away to the covert, both&#xD;
parties after him. For several minutes, Don Philip listened to&#xD;
their outcries, as they severally crashed their way into the&#xD;
thickets. He half regretted that he had not still farther delayed&#xD;
the chase after the bold outlaw. In a little while the sounds&#xD;
ceased. The alguazils were at fault, bewildered in the wood;&#xD;
and the fugitive laughed at them securely in its deep recesses.&#xD;
But, of this escape, ~Philip knew not at the moment. He re-&#xD;
sumed his progress towards the dwelling, his mood having be-&#xD;
come somewhat sterner by the momentary excitement.. Hardly&#xD;
had he advanced a dozen steps, however, when he encountered&#xD;
- the girl, Juana, wringing her hands, and showing many signs of&#xD;
terror.&#xD;
"Who is this ?"&#xD;
"Oh! Seior Don PhiPp, how I thank you! You have saved&#xD;
my poor brother. They will give him to the 'garote vii, if they&#xD;
take him; and it is I whc~ have betrayed him."&#xD;
"You! Are you not 4ie girl, Juana, belonging to Don Baltha-,&#xD;
zar de Alvaro ?"&#xD;
"Oh! not to him, but to the poor young lady, the Se~iQrita&#xD;
Olivia'?",&#xD;
"And he is y ur brother? And why do they pursue him l&#xD;
What has he don ?"&#xD;
"Oh! nothing the world, Seilor; nothing in the world; only&#xD;
he is toL good to o work at- th~ hacienda. They charge him with&#xD;
murder and other things. But it is not true. He is the best per.&#xD;

Paul himself, if ey'd only let him have his own way.".&#xD;

fortunes of Don P~iilip, no less than those of the lady of his&#xD;

ures, all friencfships, ~Ioves, associations. The eyes that look upon&#xD;
it seem spies, the voices that address it seem accusers. The very&#xD;
passk~ns and sympat~iies, thus overshadowed, grow to scorpions,&#xD;
that fasten upon th~ being in whose heart they harbor. To&#xD;
describe the sorrows of such a being, in detail, would be impos.&#xD;
sible. This would be to analyze enery emotion, thought, fancy;&#xD;
and to discern the selisuggested doubt and apprehension which&#xD;
the mind continually conjures up for its own agony. If; from&#xD;
such a knowledge of hersituation as we have been enabled to give,&#xD;
the reader cannot conceive Qf the miserable melancholy ~if Oliv.&#xD;
ia's mood, nothing iiow may be said more fully to enlight~ni him.&#xD;
There are some agencies which are indescribable; beyond which&#xD;
we may not go-beyond which we may not see-over which the&#xD;
curtain drops of itself, and which we thence only venture to con-&#xD;
template through n~eans of conjectures, which still, for the sake&#xD;
-of humanity, imply uncertainty. We give to the sufferer the&#xD;
benefit of the doubt, and in some degree feel a relief from having&#xD;
done so. It is a relief not to believe too much. We prefer to&#xD;
suppose that the vitim has some alternative by which to escape&#xD;
from a situation the agonies of which are too exquisite for en-&#xD;
durance.&#xD;
How, in what gloomy wakefulness, and torturing thought,&#xD;
Olivia passed the night, we shall not pretend to describe. Nature&#xD;
at last, in her utter exhaustion, compelled thought to silence. She&#xD;
slept, but not till a very late hour. It was midnight when Don&#xD;
Balthazar reached home, She heard him enter the house and&#xD;
immediately proceeded to assure herself that her door was fas-&#xD;
tened. The secret 4oor leading to her chamber, of which she only&#xD;
*    recently had knowledge, she also contrived to provide against by&#xD;
a heavy piece of furniture, which promised to render it unavail-&#xD;
able to the intruder. This done, the eyes of the damsel' grew&#xD;
weary, and after a sobbing prayer, she soon sank to slumber. She&#xD;
slept late the next day, and was awakened by Juana tapping at&#xD;
the entrance. Don Balthazar had already departed for the city,&#xD;
and Olivia felt relieved at the intelligence. She took a light&#xD;
breakfast, but was oppressed by heaviness after it. Her eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
drooped, and her s&#xD;

&#xD;
there was another reservation which the girl made. She did not&#xD;
say who was the victim whom the hate of Don Balthazar required&#xD;
the outlaw to assassinate. In veply to the eager and apprehensive&#xD;
inquiry of Olivia, she professed not to know. But Olivia knew.&#xD;
Her instincts readily divined the secret, as she, better than any&#xD;
body else, knew well what were her uncles necessities and danger,&#xD;
and how naturally he regarded Philip de Vasconselos as his worst&#xD;
enemy.&#xD;
"Holy Maria !" murmured the poor girl to herself: Will&#xD;
he murder him because he hath destroyed his hope as well as&#xD;
mine! Oh! surely, I must do something here 1',&#xD;
Then aloud, to Juana, she said-&#xD;
." But your brother will never do this horrid deed, Juana ?"&#xD;
"No! no! Seiiorita; not now, I'm thinking. He might have&#xD;
done it yesterday, perhaps; but now, when he finds that Don&#xD;
Balthazar keeps no faith with him, and puts the alguazils at his&#xD;
backjust as he has made a solemn bargain with him before the&#xD;
angels,-.Mateo will never trust him, or work for him in any&#xD;
way.~~&#xD;
"Hear me, Juana! I will give Mateo and yourself freedom.&#xD;
It is to me you belong.-."&#xD;
"Yes, S efiorita, to be sure; but you are not of age yet, you&#xD;
know, and your uncle is your guardian till then; and he-"&#xD;
"I know all that, Juana; but do you and your brother serve&#xD;
me faithfully-do all that I shall require in the~ meantime, and I&#xD;
will provide that you shall both have your freedom as soon as I&#xD;
am of legal age. Meanwhile, I will see the Lady Isabella, who&#xD;
is very kind to meand through her I will get Mateo's pardon&#xD;
for the crimes of which he has been guilty."&#xD;
"Oh! will you, dear Seflorita, my most dear Seflorita? But&#xD;
what do you watit i~s to do f&#xD;
"I will tell you hereafter. At present I hardly know myself.&#xD;
I must think. I see that there is something to be done, but now,&#xD;
I scarcely know what. My head feels very confused, and I am&#xD;
'so drowsy. I slept but little last night. I shall think of every-&#xD;
thing during the day. Meanwhile, do you contrive to see your&#xD;

"He did not come !" was the answer, in sad tones.&#xD;
"That is certainly very curious. He told Nuno that he would&#xD;
visit you in the evening. That was yesterday morning. Nuno&#xD;
spent the morning with him, and said he was in the greatest&#xD;
spirits; that he did nothing but talk of you, and of your beauty&#xD;
and sweetness, and grace and innocence !"&#xD;
"Ah I" exclaimed Olivia, with a sudden flushing of the cheek,&#xD;
while she pressed her hand .upon her side as if in pain.&#xD;
"What is the matter? Are you sick ?"&#xD;
"A sudden pain I,'&#xD;
"You have these sudden pains too frequently. You keep too&#xD;
much at home. Home always fills me with pains. It don't&#xD;
agree with the health of any young woman not to go frequently&#xD;
abroad, where she can see and be seen. That's what I tell Nuno&#xD;
when he wants to quarrel with me for going out so much.&#xD;
Though, in truth, I do not go out so very often. I visit nobody&#xD;
but you, and the Lady Isabella, and Donna Vicente de Ladrone,&#xD;
and the Sejioritas Guzman, and dear little Maria de Levoine,&#xD;
and Theresa Moreno, and a few others. But I tell Nuno that it&#xD;
is not for the love of it that I visit; it is only for my health. I&#xD;
should have just those sort of pains that trouble you, if I did not&#xD;
show myself everywhere every day; and I tell Nuno I am not&#xD;
going to make myself sick by minding what he says. Oh! he's&#xD;
like, all other men, and would be nothing less than a tyrant if&#xD;
I'd let him. And do you be warned in time. When you marry&#xD;
Don Philip take your position firmly at the outset; and seize&#xD;
the first opportunity of putting your foot down so-and saying,&#xD;
"Twont do, Don Philip! You are quite mistaken in your wo-&#xD;
man. I am my own mistress, Don Philip, and if you were a&#xD;
wise gentleman, and a gallant, I should be yours also!' That's&#xD;
~~hat you must say and do, Olivia, if you'd be a free woman&#xD;
and a ruling, happy wife. It's the only way !"&#xD;
4nd she stamped very prettily, with a properly graceful em-&#xD;
phasis, with her pretty little left foot, and tossed her tresses with&#xD;
the air of a sultana. But Olivia only smiled sadly in reply, and&#xD;
shook her head.&#xD;

any account. He will take you out of the custody of your im.&#xD;

re4 blood, and with his neck and shoulder stuck full of banderillas,&#xD;
I think I should. like him a great deal better. But now I don't&#xD;
like him at all. Here he keeps you no better than a prisoner.&#xD;
li~ fact, ,Olivia, I half suspect he likes you better, as a woman,&#xD;
than as a niece, and would rather not see you married to any-&#xD;
body."&#xD;
Olivia started at this random shaft; rose from the settee; and&#xD;
with staring eye and flushed cheek, gazed her answer; vague,&#xD;
wild, utterly unmeaning, as it seemed, to the remark of Leonora.&#xD;
"What! dear child, another of those cruel pains? I must&#xD;
send you some famous drops I have. Sit down again! Lie down,&#xD;
Olive, dear. I can speak to you just as well when you lie as&#xD;
when you sit. There, rest yourself for awhile. Poor, dear&#xD;
creature, how your cheek pales and flushes, in an instant, and&#xD;
what an odd look you have in your eyes! You must take some&#xD;
of my drops, and take more exercise, and take advice, Olive, and&#xD;
what's more and better, take Don Philip. Oh! he will cure you&#xD;
of all these infirmities. That's the good of a husband! Now&#xD;
don't be looking so woeful and low-spirited. Positively, there&#xD;
are big tears in your eyes! What have I been saying to make&#xD;
you so sad? I'm sure I meant to be very lively and very good-&#xD;
natured, and to tell you only su~ch thii~gs as would please you.&#xD;
By the way, something odd of your Don Philip. You must&#xD;
know that he has the most eccentric tastes in the world. What&#xD;
do you think? He gave Nuno a commission to buy him a negro&#xD;
boy, a sort of lacquey, fifteen or sixteen-a lad to go on mes-&#xD;
sages, and polish his armor, and help lace him in it, and perhaps&#xD;
dress his hair-who knows what sort of duties the page of a&#xD;
young gallant has to perform? Well, Nuno, who knows every-&#xD;
body, busies himself to procure this lad for him, and sends him&#xD;

&#xD;
influence which possessed her, and which she persuaded herself&#xD;
was due to the heat of the day, and the' absence of the freshening&#xD;
breezes of the sca. She had disposed herself on the settee as for&#xD;
sleep, when Juana reappeared, much flurried and exhausted.&#xD;
She had failed to find h~r brother, after a long and very fatigu..&#xD;
ing search in all the well-known places. It was probable, so&#xD;
Juana thought, that the late pursuit of the alguazils had driven&#xD;
Mateo from the estate. We, however, knew better. He had&#xD;
simply found it necessary to shift his quarters, and to exercise a&#xD;
little m4re caution. He may have temporarily left the grounds,&#xD;
but he did not abandon them. In truth, to state a fact which&#xD;
poor Juana did not conjecture, he found it necessary for his own&#xD;
safety to elude her search. She it was, who, with a foolish fond.&#xD;
ness, had brought old Sylvia and the alguazils upon his track. He&#xD;
kept from her sight, and changed his ground at her approach.&#xD;
The girl was very much troubled by the failure of her search.&#xD;
Olivia might have felt and shown quite as much concern on hear-&#xD;
ing her report, but for the torpor that had now seized upon her&#xD;
faculties. She repeated her commands to Juana to find her&#xD;
brother, and arrest his knife, in so many murmurs.&#xD;
"It is very warm and oppressive, Juana. We shall have a&#xD;
thunder-storm. I am very drowsy."&#xD;
Juana shook her head. She ascribed her mistress's drowsiness&#xD;
to a very different cause. She had enjoyed some of the experience&#xD;
of old Anita, and she muttered to herself-" She has had the&#xD;
spice 1', Aloud, she said,-&#xD;
"It is warm, Seflorita, and close, but I don't think there will&#xD;
be any thunder-storm. In a little while the sea-breeze will wake&#xD;
up, and you will feel* better, perhaps."&#xD;
"I will go to the summer-house, Juana, and take my siesta, if&#xD;
you think there will be no thunder-storm. Carry my dress for&#xD;
the evening over there, and my jewel-case. I will make my toilet&#xD;
there. We need apprehend no visitors now until evening, I think,&#xD;
and you need not disturb me until the proper time to dress."&#xD;

exquisitely rounded, such as frequently distinguishes the figure of&#xD;
the woman trained in a life of luxurious ease, and in that deli.&#xD;
cious climate. She seems, at once, to sleep. Her eyes close.&#xD;
Her s&amp;amp;ise is steeped in oblivion. She dreams, yet she does not&#xD;
sleep. She feels, but she is not conscious. Her blood stagnates&#xD;
in her veins; yet it works potently in her brain. She is in a&#xD;
morbid and unnatural condition. She is under the influence of&#xD;
"periapts"-spells, which steep the sense in oblivion-in un.&#xD;
consciousness of evil,-making the victim deaf to the very~ thun-&#xD;
ders that roll above his head, and blind to the forms of terror,&#xD;
or of danger, that flit before his eye. She has partaken of "the&#xD;
insane root that takes the reason prisoner." Thc~ potent medi-&#xD;
cine which now seals up her 'consciousliess was one of the se-&#xD;
crets of her fearful uncle. She has suspected him ;-she has,-&#xD;
as we have already seen, endeavored tq evade his arts; but they&#xD;
have been~too much for her. She littk~ dreams that he possesses&#xD;
avenues to all her hiding-places, keys of power to persuade to&#xD;
yielding, every lock and bolt which she deems secure. At the&#xD;
very moment when she fancied herself most safe, and was begin-&#xD;
ning to exult in the conviction that she could baffle and defy his&#xD;
arts, her strength failed her-her powers all frozen by his terrible&#xD;
spells. Late that day he reached home and asked for Olivia. He&#xD;
was told by Juana that she was in the summer-house-that she&#xD;
slept. A knowing smile slightly curled his lip. Dinner was&#xD;
served him in his chamber. The wine of Xeres sparkled before&#xD;
him. He drank with the manner of one who enjoys a tempo-&#xD;
rary respite from all the cares of life. He finished the goblet;&#xD;
refilled it; finally emptied the flask, and threw himself into his&#xD;
hammock, with a cigar. He smoked for a while, then rose, drew&#xD;
forth another flask of wine, broached it and drank freely; finished&#xD;
his cigar in his hammock, and after a little while, restlessly work~&#xD;
ed himself out of it. His eye was humid, his cheeks flushed, his&#xD;
steps uncertain.. He looked about him with an air of hesitation,&#xD;
then repeated his draught from the flask, and, with a sudden im~&#xD;
pulse, hurried out into the verandah, and down the steps into the&#xD;
garden. The keen eyes of Juana followed him from below.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight&#xD;
With a new Gorgon."&#xD;
MACBETH.&#xD;
THE day had been one of considerable bustle in Havana, and&#xD;
Don Balthazar had been very busy all the morning. Juan de&#xD;
Anasco, the contador, a brave, choleric little fellow, who united&#xD;
all the qualities of the soldier, with the experience of the sailor,&#xD;
had been a second time dispatched to coast the shores of Florida,&#xD;
in order to find a proper harbor to which the expedition might&#xD;
sail direct. He arrived the previous night, after a protracted&#xD;
voyage of three months, during which great fears were enter.&#xD;
tamed that he had been lost at sea. His escape had been a nar-&#xD;
row one, and it will illustrate the superstitions of his time and&#xD;
people, to show how he returned thanks to Heaven for his resto-&#xD;
ration and safety. In fulfilment of a vow, made at a moment of&#xD;
extreme peril, he and all his crew, the moment they reached the&#xD;
shores of Havana, threw themselves upon their knees, and in&#xD;
this manner crawled' to church to hear mass. Then lie made&#xD;
his report of disasters and discoveries, and described a secure&#xD;
harbor which he had found in Florida. The armament of De&#xD;
Soto had been nearly ready for several days before. It needed&#xD;
now but little further preparation, and waited, in fact, but a fa-&#xD;
vorable wind. The report of Anasco stimulated the industry of&#xD;
all parties. De Soto was impatientto depart, and his desires&#xD;
were so many keen spurs in the sides of the lieutenants, keep-&#xD;
ing them incessantly employed. Don Balthazar, as we have men-&#xD;
tioned, had been very busy all the morning, and hence, perhaps,&#xD;
his rather free indulgence in the pleasures of the wine-cup after&#xD;
the toils of the day were over.&#xD;

"It will never do, Philip," said he.&#xD;
"Brit it must do, Nuno," answered the other gayly. "What&#xD;
should I do at this supper? I shall not be a favorite, if present.&#xD;
I shall win none of Do Soto's smiles, and, in truth, I care not to&#xD;
win them i-and I shall not be missed if absent. There will be&#xD;
enough to shout their hopes and desires, and to respond, with&#xD;
sweet echoes, to the fine promises of Do Soto. Th~re will b~&#xD;
enough for the wine, at all events, and I should be ~nly out&#xD;
place in a scene for which my temper does not fit m~. Beside,&#xD;
my presence will only have the effect of persuading the Adelaul-&#xD;
tado that I will yet accompany the expedition."&#xD;
"And you must, Philip; we cannot well do without you.",&#xD;
"I have not been treated, Nuno, as if such were the common&#xD;
opinion."&#xD;
"But it is, no matter how they have treated you; such is their&#xD;
conviction, no less than mine 1"&#xD;
"Then are they the most ungrateful rascals in the world, and&#xD;
the greater fools, too," replied Philip. "But not to vex you,&#xD;
Nuno, (and for your sake I should really wish to go, were it&#xD;
proper that I should, under the present circumstances), I am&#xD;
grown too tender-hearted for wait! Its image now offends me. I&#xD;
see nothing persuasive in the aspect of glory: th~re is nothing&#xD;
sweet in the 'music of a trumpet charge, though it loads to victory.&#xD;
My dream now is of repose, of a sweet solitude in the shade,&#xD;
with a pair of loving eyes looking ever into mine, and the voice&#xD;
of a true heart breathing ever in my ear the music of a passion&#xD;
which asks first for peace-peace-peace! This dream haunts&#xD;
me ever. It tak~s from me the passion as the pride of arms.&#xD;
It compensates fdr all I lose. With Olivia in the country, .1&#xD;
shall be too happy to repine at any of your conquests."&#xD;
"Now do I almost wish that she may refuse thee.~,&#xD;
"No, thou dost not."&#xD;
"Thou deserves 4t !"&#xD;
"What, for being truer and more devoted to love than to am-&#xD;
bition?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, but for thy desertion of thy comrades."&#xD;
"Comrades! Oh good friend and brother of m~&#xD;
thee, for thou hast l~ een true to me, and full of&#xD;
since I have known thee-dost thou not smile w&#xD;
thy own folly, when thou speakest of my comr&#xD;

"Am I not thy c9mrade, and wilt thou suffer&#xD;

"Thou goest wit~i thy comrades, Nuno, but&#xD;

They will serve thee with loyalty, and support th&#xD;

"What! aspires he to Olivia V'&#xD;
"Yes, indeed; and with the approbation, it is thought, of her&#xD;
uncle. De Siiiolar was greatly annoyed at thy success in the&#xD;
tourney, and would have taken lance himself-he avowed-to&#xD;
* encounter thee; but that he had no horse to be relied on, and&#xD;
* lances, he thought, were things quite too frail for a man to peril&#xD;
his honor upon. He hath every confidence in his own skill,&#xD;
strength and courage, but doubts if the wit of man hath yet con.&#xD;
ceived any adequate weapons upon which these may securely&#xD;
rest themselves in th~ tournament. He holds himself in reserve,&#xD;
however, when the becoming implements of battle shall be&#xD;
made."&#xD;
"There is wit in the knight's philosophy. Think you it came&#xD;
from himself ~"&#xD;
"Verily, I do not. He reads much in Amadis and other ad-&#xD;
ventures of chivalry, and the excuse hath an antique fashion.&#xD;
And thou didst not see the Lady Olivia yesterday ~"&#xD;
Philip told of the encounter with the outlaw and the alguazils,&#xD;
and added,-&#xD;
"But, with the blessing of the Virgin, I will seek her to-day.&#xD;
While you are preparing for your feast I shall speed to her&#xD;
dwelling, resolved to put to hazard all my hopes."&#xD;
"She loves thee, Philip! I know it, if I know anything of the&#xD;
heart of woman. She will accept thee, my friend, and thou wilt&#xD;
be happy! But should she refuse thee'?"&#xD;
"ihen, perchance, thou wilt find me beside thee when thou&#xD;
liftest lance against the Apalachian."&#xD;
"I could almost pray, Philip, that she should send thee from&#xD;
her with the blessing of Abaddon, whic~i is said to be very much&#xD;
like a curse&#xD;
And he grasped vigorously the hand of his friend. They sep.&#xD;

whispers when indifference would speak, so it shrinks and hides&#xD;
when audacity and pride go forth.&#xD;
The delicious softness of the hour sunk deeply into his soul, as&#xD;
Philip de Yasconselos passed into the shady and silent defiles&#xD;
leading throughh the thick woods which girdled the hacienda of&#xD;
the lady of his love. The sWeet light from the slant beams of&#xD;
the declining sun flitted from tree to tree before him, like the&#xD;
butterfly wings of a truant fancy. The bright droplets fell,&#xD;
here and there, through the groves, lying about like eyes of fairies,&#xD;
peering through the thick grasses along the slopes. Philip's&#xD;
heart was fairly open to fairy eyes. His soul warmed an was&#xD;
thawed beneath the spells of that winged and fanciful su light.&#xD;
He had thrown aside all the restraints which held him in eck,&#xD;
through policy when amid the crow~. Here was solitude , and&#xD;
silence, and the shade ;-~----and the pathway led to love; ai the&#xD;
smiles of heaven were upon his progress! His step wa free&#xD;
as air; his soul buoyant with hope! He would soon fe t his&#xD;
eyes upon those precious features of the beloved one, rhich&#xD;
seemed to them to make a heaven of the place where t y in-&#xD;
habited! And the great shadows gathered behind hin~i as he ent;&#xD;
and the trees grew motionless; and the woods ceased to b eathe&#xD;
and murmur; and the silence deepened; and the pathway dark-&#xD;
ened; and all was harmony and security! These tran itions&#xD;
increased the sweetness of the scene, and as the glances f the&#xD;
sunlight grew less frequent, they seemed.brighter, and soft , and&#xD;
more tender and touching in the eyes of the lover. Phili went&#xD;
forward, meeting with no interruption. He passed from p. hway&#xD;
to pathway along a route well known. The avenues wi ned:&#xD;
he was approaching the dwelling. In a few moments he ould&#xD;
be in the sight, would be at the feet of her, upon whos word&#xD;
hung all his world of hope and fear. Well might he tr mble&#xD;
with the increase of his emotions. What heart is wholly brave&#xD;
at such a moment 'e and who does not feel, with great mis iving,&#xD;
that, where the anticipation is so pregnant with delicio life,&#xD;
its denial and defeat must bring a pang far greater than at of&#xD;
death '~&#xD;
&#xD;
It was in the midst of his wildest anticipations ~&#xD;
bling hopes, that Philip was suddenly aroused to&#xD;
associations, by the appearance of a man suddenly)&#xD;
of the lemon thicket beside him. He drew back,&#xD;
upon his sword. But the voice of the stranger r&#xD;
It was that of the outlaw Mateo, who was alm&#xD;
evidently greatly excited, his eyes dilated, and hi&#xD;
Wing with emotion,&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, Sefior. I am not your e:&#xD;
your friend! You have done me service, and he]&#xD;
cape from my enemies. I would not now harm a&#xD;
head. I would serve you-ay, do you good service(&#xD;
you from a great evil."&#xD;
"What evil ?"&#xD;
"Come with me!" and he laid his hand respect&#xD;
knight's arm, as if to conduct him forward.&#xD;
"It is thither I am going," said Philip, "but I i&#xD;
my good fellow."&#xD;
"Yes, you must go alone! I know that. But yc&#xD;

woods. It is there you must seek her. You werc&#xD;

"How, fellow! iDo not provoke me to anger t"&#xD;
"Forgive me, Selior; but give me time, and g&#xD;

forward. "There,-into that avenue-follow it-&#xD;

There was something in all this proceeding which was s~&#xD;
est and so startling, that, though it offended the proud kni~&#xD;
cause oti3he freedom of the outlaw's maimer, he did not f~&#xD;
showing anger. Indeed, he was too much startled, too s~&#xD;
impressed with a nam~Aess terror, to be altogether consc&#xD;
the extent of the liberty which Mateo had taken. He&#xD;
that Olivia was in danger, and vague notions of serpe&#xD;
1~igers rose before his imagination. Intuitively, he obe&#xD;
tutor, and darted into the alley.&#xD;
"Softl~r, softly!" cried the outlaw, following close&#xD;
In a few momentss he reached the summer-house.&#xD;
" Go up the steps-in-the Seflorita is there. Go&#xD;
see; but softly, very softly, and do not speak ! "&#xD;
Philip obeyed, an~d ascended the steps of the verand&#xD;
curtains were lifted; he disappeared among the colum&#xD;
Mateo waited without, among the groves. He had n~t]&#xD;
wait. Scarcely had Philip disappeared from his sight, w&#xD;
form was again seen, emerging from among the column&#xD;

meet him, and the knight staggered down the steps, almd&#xD;
ing into his arms. The outlaw hurried him into the thic&#xD;
"Quickly, quickly!" said he.-" He will have hea&#xD;

Philip staggered away, without offering opposition.&#xD;
swam; his knees tottered beneath him.&#xD;

"Rest here" answered th~ outlaw, conducting him to a&#xD;
seat enveloped in shrubbery, and almost forcing him do&#xD;
it, while he plucked an orange from the shrub-tree abo&#xD;
and in a second laid its rich juices open with a knife.&#xD;
"No!" exclaimed Philip, after a pause, rejecting the&#xD;
and staggering up from the seat-." I cannot rest here,&#xD;

"You have seen'?"&#xD;
"No mQre! Do not ask me;" and the knigl&#xD;
covered his eyes with his hands.&#xD;
"Stay for a moment!" said the outlaw-" ~&#xD;
and give him this!" and he lifted his huge mach&#xD;
and looked tha matador about to strike.&#xD;
"No!" hastily answered the knight,-laying&#xD;
the arm of the outlaw. "It must not be! Put&#xD;

And he started forward, blindly, and once mo&#xD;

"That is not the way! That leads you back&#xD;
With a shudder, Philip wheeled about, and hu&#xD;
opposite direction; the outlaw following him resp&#xD;
silence. ~ the same silence they wound their w&#xD;
thickets of lemon and orange. When they appro&#xD;
of the estate, Mateo stopped suddenly&#xD;
"I must go no further. Here I must leave&#xD;
must not risk exposure."&#xD;
Philip grasped his hand.&#xD;
"Thanks, my good fellow, thanks! I have n&#xD;

what suffering!"&#xD;
"Could it be otherwise, Senor'? ~&#xD;
"No! I thank you. It is well! you have sa&#xD;
great misery, by giving me a great hurt. I w&#xD;
means to reward you. But I thank you! I than&#xD;
groaned heavily.&#xD;
"I ask no reward, Sefio~r. I am only too hap&#xD;

"No! not till you promise me you will do. nothing I&#xD;

"It is gone 1" he murmured to himself as he went.&#xD;
gone, the hope, the brightness, and the joy! all gone! Oh!&#xD;

And he threw himself down hopelessly by the wa&#xD;
Darkness had settled down; but the stars were coming&#xD;
gently and paJely, looking like the spectres of past plc&#xD;
The dist~int lights of the city were present to his eyes also.&#xD;
were torches flaming upon the farthest hills, and pyres wer&#xD;
ing before booths and camps, from which rose faintly, a~&#xD;
vals, the sounds of merriment. Gay laughter and sho&#xD;
heard, or fancied, rising from rustic groups engaged in t&#xD;
dango; and anon, but more faintly, he caught the tinki&#xD;
guitar rising from some bohio or cottage, in the contigno&#xD;
low of the hills.&#xD;
"They laugh I they shout! they sing; as if there we&#xD;
a shadow upon the earth-as if guilt and shame had not&#xD;
the fairest aspect under heaven! Jesu, to be so bea~tW&#xD;
sweet to the eye-to acquire such power, through sunniest c&#xD;
over the soul, and yet to fail in the one great virtue which&#xD;
makes all dear things precious to the heart! But, is it s&#xD;
it true? Have I not been deceived? Am I not betray&#xD;
treachery and cunning? May it not all be a delusion&#xD;
senses? Is it sure that it was she? iDid not mine eyes&#xD;
me; and, while there is a doubt, shall I give faith to an ass&#xD;
so terrible-so revolting-so fatal to the loveliest work o&#xD;

pierce them-the curtains hung around, darkening the cha&#xD;

and, if it be true, what should keep me from slaying Ii&#xD;

But he did not rise. He could not doubt. He could r&#xD;

THE STRONG MAN'S GRIEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
321&#xD;
&#xD;
he strove to disj~ el the conviction, the more it grew to strength,&#xD;
and took possession of his soul; filling it with a nameless and&#xD;
indescribable ho~ror. For an hour he lay thus upon the earth,&#xD;
delivered to despair. There was no ref~igc for hope in thought,&#xD;
and he lay brooding, with an aimless mind, and an agonized&#xD;
spirit. At last, he rose. The strong man rarely sinks below a&#xD;
certain point. He may be overwhelmed, like the weakest, by a&#xD;
shock, at once ter~7ible, revolting, and unexpected: but the heart&#xD;
gathers its forces aftei~ a season, and nature compels the proper&#xD;
efforts for her own recovery and repose. The grief may remain,&#xD;
but it does not o~crcome~ It may prove a lasting blight to the&#xD;
hope, the fancy, 1~he affections; but there is a calm resolution&#xD;
which enables th~ sufferer to live and to perform; for perform-&#xD;
ance is, beyond a~l other things, the natural law, and the neces-&#xD;
sity of th&amp;amp; true -ian; and even the sorrow, which wounds and&#xD;
blights the heart, ~serves to strengthen the noble courage and the&#xD;
indomitable will. Philip de Vascon~elos rose from the earth&#xD;
at last. He had become somewhat more composed. iHis will&#xD;
and character were beginning to assert themselves. He was still&#xD;
the master of himn~elf/ He rose alid! went forward, sadly, slow-&#xD;
ly, but resolutely; endeavoring, with all the calm he could com-&#xD;
mand, to shape the course for his progress in the future. This&#xD;
was soon decided in his mind.&#xD;
The lights of the city grew before his eyes. The torches and&#xD;
camp-fires, along ~he hills that skirted the city, became mqre&#xD;
glaring, and cast their great red shadows upon his path. Tihe&#xD;
voices of merriment, the songs, the shouts, the joyous crh*s a~id&#xD;
laughter, with the tinkle of pleasant instruments, became louder&#xD;
and more frequc~1t on his ear. Suddenly, his eye caught a&#xD;
glimpse of the bug, temporary structure, of poles, covered with&#xD;
palm branches, a d the broad leaves of other trees, in which the&#xD;
knights were reve ling at the last festivities of the Adelantado.&#xD;
"What            murmured Philip, "but that I go with thk&#xD;
expedition? Wh~it matters it to me, now that I am no favorite?&#xD;
I ask no favors, here are blows and danger to be encountered&#xD;
among the Apalacliian, and he who is armed as~ I am now, against&#xD;

~ll terrors, can make himself a favorite, by making him~&#xD;
ful. What better region in which to bury my sorro~&#xD;
hide my anguish from vulgar eyes? Where 'can I mor~&#xD;
escape from this agony of thought? 'In the fierce stril&#xD;
will be{orgetfulness; and forgetfulness will be the most~&#xD;
of hopes, even though it comes only through the emb+~&#xD;
death. I will go with Nuno !"&#xD;
Under this new impulse, he hurried forward rapidly&#xD;
the scene of festivity, as if fearing to trust himself to think&#xD;
upon the subject of his progress. It'was not long b~&#xD;
reached the place; the shouts from within, the music,&#xD;
his ears with a sense of pain, without, however, impa~&#xD;
resolution to join the revellers,-to engage in their expd&#xD;
The structure in which the Adelantado and his Floridi~an&#xD;
held their feast was, as we have said, a rude, simple 'faI~&#xD;
signed only for the temporary purpose. It consisted&#xD;
shafts, green trees freshly cut and thatched with bam~&#xD;
- fresh bushes. It was fantastica~lly adorned in a style w~&#xD;
climate and productions of' the country naturally suggest&#xD;
eye of taste. The flag of Spain, the banners of De Sot'&#xD;
the several captains, were disposed happily around th&#xD;
ment. Green leaves and gorgeous flowers were wreath&#xD;
the columns, declaring visibly the wealth of the delicioi&#xD;
~of which they were the natural tribute. Fruits in' gay&#xD;
hung down, within reach from the rafters: the luscious~&#xD;
mellow banana, the juicy and fragrant orange. Of th(&#xD;
ion fc~ the feast, it will be much easier for the reader&#xD;
inc than for us to describe. Enough that the Adelantad&#xD;
knights of the expedition had done their best to require&#xD;
pitalitie~ of the Islanders in a fashion worthy of their ow&#xD;
had expended no small part of the treasures remaining f~&#xD;
outfit, in doing the honors gallantly and with becoming&#xD;

himself abroad from court and verandah. Some dishes were pre-&#xD;
pared formed wholly of the tongues of singing birds; and we&#xD;
may add, were eaten with an appetite such as might be assumed&#xD;
to originate only with a hope to win the musical powers of the&#xD;
member thus hushed forever. The unripened plantain was&#xD;
sliced and browned in sugar by the fire;. or, roasted, was macer-&#xD;
ated with the inspissated juices of the cane. This course, by the&#xD;
way, was preceded by one consisting wholly of sea and shell-fish,&#xD;
and was succeeded by fruits of more than twenty kinds, all na-&#xD;
tives of the island. 'Fresh guayavas, fragrant ananas, bananas&#xD;
and sapadillos, yielded themselves to delighted palates in deli-&#xD;
cious sympathy with wines of' Xeres, which had already began to&#xD;
circulate with potency before Philip de Vasconselos entered the&#xD;
assembly.&#xD;
He entered at a moment when De Soto was addressing his&#xD;
audience. The Spanish language is one of equal grandeur and&#xD;
beauty; the Spanish character is necessarily one of ambition and&#xD;
hyperbole. The language of a people usually declares for its&#xD;
character in its best days. We know from other histories how&#xD;
a language may exhibit more vitality than a people; how glori-&#xD;
ously it survives them. A language, known through its literature,&#xD;
is perhaps the only durable monument of a people. Dc Soto,&#xD;
as' is well known, was an accomplished cavalier, greatly distin-&#xD;
guished at a period when Spain could claim a host of heroes. It&#xD;
is not so well known that he was an accomplished speaker,&#xD;
thoroughly master of the arts of language, versed in its delica-&#xD;
cies, and practised in ~ll its graces. His audience listened to him&#xD;
with ecstasy, and rounded his sentences with their vivas and&#xD;

braves. He dwelt upon that superiority of character whk&#xD;
ulted in adventure . The art of war, he contended, and its&#xD;
ecution in new lands, was, perhaps, the very noblest and&#xD;
god-like of all human arts. He spoke of the greatness&#xD;
nation, a~ particularly renowned for the use of this art, in it~&#xD;
inspiring exercises. He painted fame and glory, bright2&#xD;
purelyand grandly, a~ they appear always to youth ai~d entei&#xD;
and dwelt upon the progresses of Cortez and Pizarro in I~&#xD;
and Peru-subjects, in hearing the report of which, the Ca&#xD;
ear could never tire. By a natural transition he came to&#xD;
of their present adventure in the wilds of Florida. lie di&#xD;
disparage the valor of the red men of Apalaehia, nor seek to&#xD;
the picture of danger which he drew as a necessary conseque~&#xD;
the enterprise; but he insisted upon the utter impossibility&#xD;
valor of the red-men as able to stand for a moment before&#xD;
warriors as he led to the encounter. He particularly dwelt up&#xD;
great treasures of the country, its glorious cities hidden in the I&#xD;
of mighty mountains; its treasures of gold and silver; its&#xD;
to be gathered in heaps along its shores; arguments whi&#xD;
we~lI knew, were beyond all others, in persuading young&#xD;
tion and greedy avarice to ~s banners. At the close,&#xD;
Philip de Vasconselos enter, he took the opportunity of thr4&#xD;
out a few bitter sarcasms upon the timid, the laggard, the&#xD;
the souls deficient in ~true courage and noble enterprise, wh(&#xD;

scarcely acknowledged, with a stately bend of the head, the&#xD;
measured but courteous approach of our hero, and the deepening&#xD;
shadows upon whose~ brow argued o friendly welcome for what&#xD;
he might say.. But Philip was little oved by these unfriendly au-&#xD;
spices. He respected De Soto as brave and noble cavalier,&#xD;
distinguished equally by talents an graces, and high in favor of&#xD;
his sovereign; bust his respect and admiration were not so pro-&#xD;
found as to cause him to suffer any ortification from the loss oi1~&#xD;

had been assigned to the Adelantado, raising him a little above&#xD;
the re~t of the assembly,-.passing through the crowd with exceed-&#xD;
ingly deliberate pace, until he stood but a few paces from the&#xD;
person he addressed.&#xD;
"Your Excellency," said he, "has been pleased to indulge in&#xD;
certain remarks of censure upon that unambitious, unperforming&#xD;
and timid class, who, bred to arms, are yet reluctant to engage&#xD;
in the honorable adventure to which you invite them. I cannot&#xD;
deceive myself as to the fhct, that certain in this assembly&#xD;
are disposed to make these remarks applicable to the person&#xD;
who now addresses you. I trust it is not necessary to say&#xD;
here that for any one who would impute to me the want of&#xD;
courage, I have but a single answer, and that lies at the point of&#xD;
my weapon; be it lance, or sword, battle-axe, or dagger. I am&#xD;
ready to enconuter any questioner. That I have been slow in.&#xD;
resolving to accompany this expedition, has been no fault of&#xD;
mine. I came hither from my own land for this very purpose;&#xD;
and until I reached havana, I knewno disposition to change my&#xD;
determination. It will be admitted, I think, that the encourage-&#xD;
ments offered to me for this adventure, however, have been very&#xD;
few; and, perhaps, were I to say the truth, I should describe the&#xD;
course taken with me as designed specially to rebuke the pre-&#xD;
sumption which had prompted me to seek a place under the&#xD;
banner of Castile."&#xD;

"Not so, Sefior, not so, by God 1" exclaimed De&#xD;
rupting him energetically.&#xD;
'~ Be this as it may, your Excellency, it is one of 1&#xD;

De Soto smiled grimly. Philip saw the smile, ~&#xD;

"But it matters not," he proceeded, "to say wher&#xD;
ated to declare my purpose. It will suffice, your&#xD;

them. Such was their reconciliation. The speech of Philip had&#xD;
taught Andres-strangely enough-that the passion of his brother&#xD;
for Olivia de Alvaro had proved as fruitless as his own. Why?&#xD;
This was the mystery which none could solve. Philip tore him-&#xD;
self away from the brief embrace, and was hurrying out, when&#xD;
Nuno de Tobar rushed up, and, warmed with wine, caught him&#xD;
exultingly in his arms.&#xD;
"But how is all this, Philip V'&#xD;
At that moment Don Balthazar de Alvaro suddenly entered,&#xD;
and was passing very near them. Instinctively, Philip grasped&#xD;
the handle of his sword, and his eyes were fastened upon the&#xD;
uncle of Olivia, with such an expression as made the latter start,&#xD;
as at the approach of a famished tiger. Philip recovered him-&#xD;
self in a moment, turned away from the face of him whom he&#xD;
longed to destroy, and was followed out by Nuno int&amp;amp;ihe open&#xD;
air.&#xD;
"Tell me," said the latter, "how comes this change ?"&#xD;
"Do not ask me, Nuno; enough that-I go with you."&#xD;
"Holy Mother, but your looks, Philip ~&#xD;
"Heed them not-heed me not-let me leave you, Nuno, I&#xD;
am not fit for this assembly."&#xD;
"But you have been to see Olivia-you have seen her ?"&#xD;
"I hctve seen her 1"&#xD;
"And she refused you ?"&#xD;
"No !-I have not spoken with her."&#xD;
"Seen her-but not spoken !-What! Your courage failed&#xD;
you at the last moment-you had not the heart ?"&#xD;
"I had not the heart !"&#xD;
"Jesu! man! What weakness is this ?"&#xD;
"No weakness No more, Nuno. There is that which puts&#xD;
an eternal barrier between Olivia de Alvaro and myself-aj.ar-&#xD;
rier deep as the grave, impassable as hell. I can tell you nothing.&#xD;
You but distress me when you ask-ask nothing. From this&#xD;
moment name her not to me, Nuno, unless you would make me&#xD;
your foe for ever t"&#xD;

DoN BALTHAZAR was greatly surprised by what he h&#xD;

&#xD;
"TJe has discovered all !" was his secret thought. "Yet how ?"&#xD;
Here was the farther difficulty. "What-was the discovery which&#xD;
Philip had made ~' "To what degree was he com~nitted by it ?"&#xD;
His anxieties increased with his unuttered inquiree, addressed to&#xD;
himself But Don Balti~azar had a rare faculty of self-c6nceal-&#xD;
ment. His secretiveness was a large development in his moral&#xD;
orgai~~tion. He could smile, and look calmly about him, and&#xD;
engage in the frivolous conversation of society,----jn all* the&#xD;
business of the crowd-seemingly unrnoved,-while t~ie vultures&#xD;
of doubt, and dread,~ and conscience, were all at work tearing at&#xD;
his vitals. He joined in the talk going on in the assembly. In&#xD;
this way he might obtain some clues to the secret of Philip.&#xD;
But he learned nothing satisfactory. One fact, however, he&#xD;
gathered from all that was said, which seemed to weigh upon his&#xD;
thoughts; and that only related to the sudden appearance of the&#xD;
knight of Portugal, at a late hour, in fact not many minutes be-&#xD;
fore himself. "Where had he been till that hour ?" While ask-&#xD;
ing huinself this q~iestion, Nuno de Tobar reappeared within the&#xD;
circle. "I will sound him /" was the unexpressed resolution of&#xD;
the Don, as he sauntered around, gradually winding his way&#xD;
towards the place where Nuno had taken his seat. The counte-&#xD;
nance of the latter was troubled. His mind was in some confu&#xD;
sion, as well from the wine he had taken, as from the conference&#xD;
with Philip. But the approach of Don Balthazar served, in sOme&#xD;
degree, to steady his intellect, and make him cautious. He knew&#xD;
that Olivia's uncle had bcen hostile to his friend. It had not es-&#xD;
caped the notice of Nuno, that the glance with which Philip had&#xD;
met Don Balthazar, but a few moments before, was that of a de-&#xD;
termined, if not a savage hatred. Sympathizing earnestly with&#xD;
his friend, Niino shared, in some degree, his hostile sentiments.&#xD;
lie had himself never been the friend of Don Balthazar, ~nd&#xD;
was now more than ever disposed to regard him as an enemy.&#xD;
In some way, he felt assured that the present sufferings of Vas.&#xD;
conselos, and his abandonment of Olivia, were due to the evil in-&#xD;
fluence of her unefe.&#xD;
Thus feeling, he was sobered by the approach of the Don;&#xD;

Baithazar, like Philip, had been absent from the fe&#xD;
late hour. They had reached the assembly at ne&#xD;
time. Might not their mutual absence, and arrh&#xD;

his feelings and his instincts, became cool, searching&#xD;
and Don Balthazar extracted nothing from him. 'j&#xD;

It's that cross-grained uncle that she has. He has done it all. I&#xD;
wonder what is the secret of his power over her. I'm sure she&#xD;
hates him. But he rules her in spite of it - and he has compelled&#xD;
her to refuse him."&#xD;
"I don't believe it, child; for I believe Philip, and he positively&#xD;
assured me that he tiad not asked her. He's not the man to lie,&#xD;
or to be ashamed of rejection. He has no such weakness. He&#xD;
was very earnest about it-very miserable,-.and entreated me&#xD;
never again to speak to him on the subject."&#xD;
"Then I'm sure she has refused him. Did he say he had *not&#xD;

"No! I knew that he went to the hacienda late in the after-&#xD;

"Now, as if that were reasonable, -Nuno."&#xD;
"It is certainly very strange. I can't see into it."&#xD;
"But I do; and the whole mystery lies in the one fact that he'&#xD;
has simply been rejected, and his pride will not confess it. lie&#xD;
has been mortified by refusal, when he counted confidently on&#xD;
success. And I confess, I counted on it too; for though Olivia&#xD;
always said that she would refuse him, yet I know that she loves&#xD;
him desperately, and as she will love no other man. But it is all&#xD;
the doing of Don Balthazar. He hates Don Philip-he hates&#xD;
both the brothers-I have seen that a thousand times. But what&#xD;
arc his hates to her,. and how has he succeeded in' making her sa-.&#xD;
crifice her love to them? What is the secret of his power to&#xD;
control her against her own happiness and will? That is the se-&#xD;
cret which I should like to find-out !"&#xD;
"You are right, I suspect, in ascribing it all to her uncle.&#xD;
Philip is not the man to be rejected by any woman in a hurry,&#xD;
and I am convinced, like yourself that Olivia r~ully loves him as&#xD;

"You mistake her there! Olivia ~s a woman o&#xD;

the strength of her passion, in an affair which so de&#xD;

"Philip de Vasconselos is like no other man, I know."&#xD;
"Ah! you are mistaken. In some things all men are pretty&#xD;
much alike; and in an affair of love-where there is real love-&#xD;
your strong cavalier and stately Don are just as feeble as the&#xD;
man of silk and velvet. You are all pretty much alike-all&#xD;
easily overthrown-where women are concerned."&#xD;
"It is a very strange affair throughout."&#xD;
"I'll find it out to-morrow, if I live. I'll. see Olivia in the&#xD;
morning, and she must have sharper wits, and greater strength,&#xD;
than I believe, if., she can hide the secret much longer from my&#xD;
eyes. You will admit that if Philip has seen her, then the prob-&#xD;
ability is that she has refused him."&#xD;
"He himself admits that he has seen her-seen her this very&#xD;
day, but denies that he has spoken with her. The re is the diffi-&#xD;
culty-that is the surprising fact."&#xD;
"Seen her, but not spoken with her! You say he went to&#xD;
see her, and did see her, but said nothing 'P'&#xD;
"Yes; that is precisely what he asserts."&#xD;
"Oh! he means no more than this-that he did not propose."&#xD;
"It may be-yet he spoke very precisely and positively."&#xD;
"Well, Olivia will be able to answer that. She will, at all&#xD;
events, confess that there was an interview; though she may tell&#xD;
me nothing of what passed between them. If she says so much&#xD;
as that, you will readily suppose that Don Philip has simple&#xD;
kept back something which his pride will not suffer him to con-&#xD;
fess."&#xD;
"Yes ;-though how to believe it of Philip-how to suppose&#xD;
him so weak, or to think that he should keep back the truth from&#xD;
me-that is what troubles me."&#xD;
"Well, leave it till the morrow'!" said the wife.&#xD;
With the morrow, eager to penetrate the mystery, Leonora&#xD;
de Tobar prepared, at an early hour, to visit her friend. She&#xD;
found, unexpectedly, the uncle and niece together. Olivia was&#xD;
looking paler than usual, and wore an exhausted and suffering&#xD;

pressionless. Her whole mental nat~ire seemed&#xD;
nioved like an automaton; welcor~ed her gues&#xD;

She gave way at last, but by no me ns with the in&#xD;

whole extent of which, though, in her sane moments, she h~d&#xD;
suspicions, she had really no conscious knowledge except by h~r&#xD;
prolonged sufferings day by day. But, very soon, the conver~a-&#xD;
tion aroused her. The daring Leonora, according to her ne~w&#xD;
plan of operation, now addressed herself to the uncle. Turnh~g&#xD;
to him very abruptly, and when he was least prepared for tI~e&#xD;
assault, she said-.&#xD;
"So, Don Balthazar, we are to lose Don Philip de Vasconseh~s&#xD;
afterr all. The report is, that he joined the expedition last nigh,&#xD;
after a very eloquent speech. But you must have heard it all,&#xD;
and can tell us much better than anybody else."&#xD;
Qlivia looked up with a wild and vacant stare, but the s~n~e&#xD;
seemed to be slowly kindling in her eyes. With a frown, Do~i&#xD;
Balthazar replied:&#xD;
"I do not see what there is to tell. No more, it appears, tha~i&#xD;
you know already. Your husband was present. He, perhaps ,&#xD;
remembers the speech, since he regards the knight of Portugal&#xD;
as something of an orator. Let him report it."&#xD;
"Well, I suppose, after this, the fact may be held undeniable;&#xD;
and now the wonder is why he should have left his purj~os.~&#xD;
doubtful so long. Why, but a week ago, it was in everybody'~&#xD;
mouth that he was not to go at all-that he had abandoned the&#xD;
expedition altogether."&#xD;
"Well, you admire him the more, I suppose, because of hi~&#xD;
feminine caprices," was the surly answer.&#xD;
"No, indeed, though I don't see anything amiss in caprices&#xD;
now and then. They are rather agreeable, to my notion. But,&#xD;
in his case, people found good reasons for his refusal to go; better,&#xD;
indeed, than I can find for his present change of mind."&#xD;
"AhI well! good reasons ?"&#xD;
"To be sure! Very excellent reasons, Sefior; they gave him&#xD;
credit for discovering more precious treasures in Havana than he&#xD;
was like to find in Florida, and at less peril of life and comfort;&#xD;
and these were surely good reasons for staying.~~&#xD;
"Humph 1" quoth the Don, looking askance at Olivia, in&#xD;

as her born guardian, and protector, and lover, and friend; and&#xD;
if he wrongs her faith, he discredits himself; not her. That's&#xD;
my notion in such cases. Don't suppose that you make me feel&#xD;
at all uncomfortable by your hints; for I am willing to admit,&#xD;
to all Cuba, that I was very weak, and very loving-too loving&#xD;
to believe evil of the man I fancied! So now, Don Balthazar,&#xD;
if it pleases you to talk of my affairs, I can't prevent you. It's&#xD;
the fool's privilege, as you have just said, against which there is&#xD;
no law, to say what one pleases of his friends; and you have&#xD;
certainly the same rights as other people; but, in truth, if y~u&#xD;
will ~uffer me, I will speak rather of Olivia and Don Philip, as&#xD;
being just now' much better subjects, and about which I feel&#xD;
much more concerned."&#xD;
The little woman's good nature* actually endowed her with&#xD;
wit and wisdom. Don Balthazar was quite astounded by her&#xD;
audacity. She was invulnerable to his shafts. He looked up,&#xD;
and glared upon her more savagelythan ever, but remained si-&#xD;
lent; and in a moment after, seemed more than ever busy' with&#xD;
his documents. But Leonora went on, and somehow, his in-&#xD;
stinCts prompted him to listen. She might have heard from her&#xD;
husband what the latter had withheld from him; and his doubts&#xD;
had been by no means quieted by the reflections of the pa~t&#xD;
night. Leonora now especially addressed herself to Olivia.&#xD;
"I confess, dear Olivia, that I am surprised and disappointed.&#xD;
I feel vexed at this strange determination of Don Philip, know-&#xD;
ing that he loves you, and i~elieving that you love him, that he&#xD;
should resolve to go without ~addressing you. But perhaps he&#xD;
1w8 done so, and you have been so foolish as to refuse him! AIm,&#xD;
my child, can it be possible?"&#xD;
The sad eyes of Olivia, now full of expression, anticipated the&#xD;
reply of her lips.&#xD;
"He has not addressed me, Leonora; he has not even been&#xD;
here. I have not seen him since the moment when I was taken&#xD;
sick at the tournament."&#xD;
"Is it possible'?"&#xD;
"True !" said Olivia, very mournfully. "True!"&#xD;

"No! I have not."&#xD;
"That is strange !"&#xD;
"Why strange ?"&#xD;
"He has certainly seen you since the tournameAt."&#xD;
"Why do you think so&#xD;
"He told Nuno that he had! Told him so only last iii&#xD;
Don Balthazar could not keep his eyes upon the paperE&#xD;
looked up inquiringly to Leonora. She noted the curic&#xD;
pressing in his eyes, and was determined to wi1~hhold r&#xD;
which should either obtain for herself the secret which s&#xD;
sired, or should goad the haughty Don with reVelations&#xD;
she somehow fancied would annoy him. When, tl~ereforp,&#xD;
anxiously besought her, as to the alleged visit of Philip, si&#xD;
pare4l to tell all that she knew.&#xD;
* "Well, I know that he has been to see you twice in t&#xD;
two days. He came day before yesterday, and was a&#xD;
an encounter which took place in your grounds here bet~&#xD;
troop of alguazils and a certain outlaw."&#xD;
"A slave-a mestizo ?" involuntarily asked the Don.&#xD;
* "Even so: one Mateo! Philip told Nuno all about ii&#xD;
interposed, finding half a score of persons upon one; ur&#xD;
officers told him how the matter stood, and then he suiferec&#xD;
to proceed. The outlaw made his escape, however; anc&#xD;
Philip then proceeded to visit you, when your girl, Juan&#xD;
him, and told him that you were sick and had retired I&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"When was this ?" demanded Olivia) with strange calm&#xD;
"Two days ago only."&#xD;
OliVia rose and called Juana. The girl was close at Ii&#xD;
had been listening, in fact, at the door. She made her a&#xD;

The gh'l hung her head and made no answer. Olivia turned&#xD;
to Leonora.&#xD;
"You say that Don Philip came here again, Leonora? Was&#xD;
here yesterday?"&#xD;
"Yes-so he assured Nuno last night."&#xD;
"When? at what hour?"&#xD;
"Last evening-about 'dusk."&#xD;
"And saw me 9"&#xD;
"So he said; but, strangely enough, he mentioned that though&#xD;
he saw you, he did not speak to you. Yet he came to speak.&#xD;
He came to offer you his hand."&#xD;
Olivia pressed her hands upon her heart, with a look of inde-&#xD;
scribable suffering. Don Balthazar arose, somewhat agitated,&#xD;
and approached Leonora.&#xD;
"You say, Sefiora, that Don 'Philip was here last evening?&#xD;
Last evening !"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And at dusk ?"&#xD;
"About that time. He came hither about sunset. Nuno saw&#xD;
him when he left his lodgings to make the visit, and he told him&#xD;
all about it."&#xD;
"And he saw me?" said Olivia. "Where was I?"&#xD;
"In the summer-house, Sefiorita !" was the voluntary reply&#xD;
of Juana, who had been eagerly waiting to speak.&#xD;
"It is a mistake I" said Don Balthazar-" He was not here.&#xD;
I tell you, Seiiorita, it is altogether a mistake."&#xD;
This was said with a vehemence meant to cover an agitation&#xD;
which the knight could not otherwise subdue. Olivia beheld this&#xD;
agitation through the effort to conceal it. His asseveration went&#xD;
for nothing, particularly as Leonora insisted that Don Philip had&#xD;
declared the fact to her husband, only last night, and after the&#xD;
former had made his speech.&#xD;
"It is impossible !" said Don Balthazar, in a wanner meant&#xD;
to silence all further discussion; but the malignant element in the&#xD;
bosom of the slave, Juana, was not prepared to suffer him to&#xD;

escape thus easily. She could not suppress the grin of&#xD;
- from her features, as she hastily replied&#xD;
"Oh! yes, Sefior; Don Philip was certainly here; at&#xD;
at the summer-house. I saw him wiien he was leaving&#xD;
wa~ there he must have seen the Seflorita. You came&#xD;
tire summer-house just after Don Philip had gone."&#xD;
"I!" exclaimed the Don with troubled aspect-" I!"&#xD;
"You, Selior !" cried Olivia, rising and striding~ acro&#xD;
interval that separated her from her uncle-while h~r eyes&#xD;
ing beyond their orbs, were fixed upon him with an expi&#xD;
of mixed agony and horror.&#xD;
"You !---you !-were you in the summer-house last ever&#xD;
you,-when I was there !"&#xD;
He was silent . . . . Juana supplied the answer.&#xD;
"Yes, my lady-the Sefior went to the summer-house&#xD;
he had dined. But it was dusk before I saw Don Philip.&#xD;
not see Don Philip when he came, but only when he was ci&#xD;
down the steps of the summer-house, and was going away&#xD;
I was quite frightened to see his face. He looked like&#xD;
that was going crazy; and 0! how he did groan! I heard&#xD;
I was suite afraid to go near him."&#xD;
"What did he here at that hour !" cried Don Balthazai&#xD;
ously-" How dare he intrude upon my privacy! -&#xD;
dared you&#xD;
He~ was arrested in his speech by the action of OlivTh&#xD;
suddenly pressed closer to him, so as almost to touch hir&#xD;
hands clasped together, and with such a look-so like ma&#xD;
in her face-that, involuntarily, the uncle recoiled from he:&#xD;
the words died away upon his lips.&#xD;
"Oh! you have done your worst now !" she exclaimed&#xD;
see it all! I know it all! Fiend and monster as you are,-&#xD;
feel it, too, do you not! You see it! You will burn for&#xD;

She clasped her head with both her hands, and reeled about&#xD;
dizzily. Leonora caught her in her arms in time to save her&#xD;
from falling upon the floor. She was in a swoon! It came sea-&#xD;
sonably to save her from madness. We close the scene. Let&#xD;

"I swear&#xD;

DON BALTHAZA1~ lied into the recesses ot the thick&#xD;

"He knows all, indeed !" he exclaimed, when he fel&#xD;
self' alone. "Where was that scoundrel, Mateo, that I&#xD;

The reckless outlaw laughed irreverently at his own sa&#xD;

hatred which he felt for his superior. Don Baithazar was&#xD;
not a timid man,~was not easily startled by any event or&#xD;
presence,-and certainly had no fears of any individual foe;&#xD;
but the appearance of the outlaw, so apropos to his summons,&#xD;
brought up to his mind a vague image of the satanic presence,&#xD;
which, in fact, was the, true meaning of his requisition. It is the&#xD;
hellish agent which we summon always when we design a hellish&#xD;
deed. Don Balthazar,, however,, welcomed the fugitive after his&#xD;
own fashion, withe air of a master who knew his rights, and&#xD;
had reason to complain.&#xD;
"You are here at; last! But you have done nothing. You&#xD;
promised finely! Where are your performances'? Had, you&#xD;
done: according to your pledges, I had been saved from a very&#xD;
unpleasant affair !"&#xD;
"Had I done !-and who is to blame, I beg to know, that I&#xD;
have not done'? You make a bargain with me, and when I set&#xD;
about to do my work, I find your alguazils upon my heels.&#xD;
Your alguazils, bearing your orders to seize and bind me, and&#xD;
have me properly dressed for the honors of the garote vii! Ah!&#xD;
indeed! The garote vii for your own ally-the man, who is to&#xD;
risk his life doing your business! What do you say to that'?"&#xD;
"What do I say! Why, that the thing was wholly a mistakes&#xD;
The rascals did not understand me."&#xD;
"A mistake! Oh, it, would have been precious consolation&#xD;
to me, with my neck fitted with an iron cravat, to' hear that it&#xD;
was done wholly by mistake! I had as lief die by the law, as by&#xD;
mistake, any day !"&#xD;
"I tell you that the alguazils were ordered after you, before&#xD;
I had spoken with you; I only forgot to see and speak to them,&#xD;
and they continued the search in consequence. But I will put&#xD;
a stop to their pursuit."&#xD;
"Oh! you forgot only! But that was strange on your part.&#xD;
You're too much a man of business to forget such things in com-&#xD;
mon. But you'll remember now, you say; and I'm to be pur-&#xD;
sued no more 'P&#xD;
"Yes: I shall see to it this yery day; but you are to do the&#xD;
business you undertook'?"&#xD;
"Ah! that business !"&#xD;
"Yes; you will dispose of this knight of Portugal, shortly,&#xD;
as you do your prayers ;-send him to God by a quick convey-&#xD;
ance'? You are not afraid'? You will not shrink from your&#xD;
engagements'?"&#xD;
"Afraid! 0, n6! I'm not afraid- of your alguazils! As for&#xD;
keeping my engagements, that will depend upon the way you&#xD;

keep yours. I don't see that, so far, you've been very k en to&#xD;
remember them."&#xD;
"You make too much of thiS forgetfulness of mine.~~&#xD;
"Oh! you may forget again! I never trust a bad me ory;&#xD;
not even my own. See this handkerchief; there are three knots&#xD;
in it. Every one marks a life. This is one I put in it '~ hen I&#xD;
engaged with you to send Don Philip by a short cut to para.&#xD;
dise. You must knot your handkerchief too, before I tal e this&#xD;
knot out of mine."&#xD;
Don Balthazar received the suggestion rather literally He&#xD;
coolly took out his handkerchief; and proceeded to knot I ; but&#xD;
the Qutlaw laughed.&#xD;
"Look you, Don Balthazar, the man who can't write, akes&#xD;
his knot in the handkerchief; but that's not the rule fo you.&#xD;
You must make your knot on paper, with pen and ink; and&#xD;
there must be a great seal to it. Get me the pardon, und r the&#xD;
hands of the Adelantado, for all past offences; that's on knot&#xD;
you're to make. Prepare me the paper that proves mi and&#xD;
Juana's freedom, and when. you give me these, I shall ta e out&#xD;
my knot here, and Don Philip will fly off to join the an els in&#xD;
paradise; that will save you from finding him in you way&#xD;
hereafter."&#xD;
And the fellow chuckled greatly at his own wit. Do Bal-&#xD;
thazar was not so well pleased at these requisitions.&#xD;
"But, when I have got you these papers, what security ave I&#xD;
that you will do what you promise for me&#xD;
"Security! Well, it seems to me that your security w~ill b~&#xD;
quite as good as mine. What security do you give me, ~hen I&#xD;
have slain Don Philip, that you will do for me what you~ hav~&#xD;
promised ?"&#xD;
"Slave! Do you count the word of a nobleman linda&#xD;
soldier, as of no more value than that of a mestizo a~d an&#xD;
outlaw ?"&#xD;
"Pooh, pooh, Sefior; that sort of talk won't do between us!&#xD;
It's you that are the outlaw, not me! I am to kill Don Philip&#xD;
on your account, not on mine; because you hate him, anki not&#xD;
from any hate that I bear the Portuguese. Were Ito kill h5m on&#xD;
my own account, I should be outlawed: killing him for yo~u, it's&#xD;
your act, not mine, and you're the outlaw! Don't speak 1~o. me&#xD;
as if there was any difference between us. There's none; I tell&#xD;
you, but what's in my favor! I think myself a much Vetter&#xD;
man than you any way. I don't get other people to light my&#xD;
battles, or avenge my wrongs-there's where I'm the etter&#xD;
man; and as for strength and skill with the weapon, why, I ~could&#xD;

slit your throat in the twinkling of an eye, and before you'could&#xD;
mutter an&#xD;
Thus saying, he flourished his naked machete in fearful prox-&#xD;
imity to the knight's face. The cheeks of the Don flushed crim-&#xD;
son, and he hastily drew his sword half-way from the sheath.&#xD;
"Oh! put up," said the outlaw; "it's no use-and besides, it's&#xD;
not necessary. I'm not going to kill you; ,and if I were, you&#xD;
could do nothing to help yourself. I wouldn't give you the&#xD;
smallest chance. 4'd be into you, and through you, before you&#xD;
could get your toledo out of the scabbard. I'm none of ybur&#xD;
fine knights of Cast\ile and Portugal, to let you put yourself just&#xD;
in your own attitude to fight; all that seems to me only foolishness..&#xD;
Here'~ my enemy, and I'm to kill him. If I don't kill him, he&#xD;
kills me. Now, I don't want to be killed, just yet; and I rather&#xD;
he should die than me! What then? Will I give him a&#xD;
chance? Not a bit of it! I'll slit hi~ throat without saying,&#xD;
'By your leave, senior.' And if it was my profit to slit yours,&#xD;
I'd have done it. without all this palaver. Don't be afraid.&#xD;
We're on terms. I've a contract with you; and I'm willing to&#xD;
work for you, on conditions. But' you must get down from the&#xD;
great horse when you speak to me. I can't bear to be ridden&#xD;
over by any Don that ever came fr~m Spain! and I won't!&#xD;
There now; you know me. Is it a thing clear between us '~&#xD;
Will you get me the pardon, the free papers, with the big seal?&#xD;
Shall I kill the knight of Portugal for you ?" -&#xD;
"You're a bold fellow, Matco ;-.it's a bargain I"&#xD;
"Very good. When shall I have the papers? I must have&#xD;
them, to see, and to show; for I can't read, senior, and must get&#xD;
some one to read them for me, to see that all's right, before I&#xD;
do my share in the business.~~&#xD;
"You are hard in. your conditions, Mateo; but you shall have&#xD;
your own way. Meet me here, at this hour, two days hence,&#xD;
and you shall have the pardon and the papers !"&#xD;
"Good, senior; I'll be punctual to the sun."&#xD;
When the two separated, the knight proceeded, almost imme-&#xD;
diately, to take horse, and ride into the city; the outlaw disap-&#xD;
peared within. the thickets. Don Balthazar did not return to the&#xD;
hacienda that night. In his place, Olivia had another visitor.&#xD;
While Sylvia slept, Juana conducted her brother to the chamber&#xD;
of her mistress. The latter appeared. to expect him; she was&#xD;
certainly not unprepared for his coming.&#xD;
It was surprising to behold her countenance, as the bold out-&#xD;
law entered the chamber. Where had she acquired that won-&#xD;
derful composure-that strength of calm-so suddenly ?-.-after&#xD;

&#xD;
the overthr w of her hope and pride, so terrible and so recent?&#xD;
-after that wild compulsion which seemed to have racked&#xD;
equally the body and the soui~, how had she so soon and&#xD;
thoroughly recovered? In the utter wreck of her pride, her&#xD;
sensibilities seemed suddenly to have become blunted. She&#xD;
had the look of one who felt nothing. There was not in her&#xD;
countenance the slightest show of suffering. Her eyes were&#xD;
strong in their glare,-not sad. The muscles of her mouth&#xD;
betrayed not the slightest emotion. She looked like one of&#xD;
those wretched persons whom we sometimes encounter in society,&#xD;
who grow prematurely wise-~-who never know youth or child.&#xD;
hood-who spring, at a single bound, into manhood, and the full&#xD;
possession of their minds; and who do so, in almost all cases&#xD;
at the expense of their hearts-nay, to th~ utter death and burial&#xD;
of their hearts! Such premature development always makes&#xD;
monsters. The look of Olivia was that of one whose heart was&#xD;
utterly dead within her, and who has survived and forgotten-if;&#xD;
indeed, she ever knew-its loss. It was-to sum up in a word&#xD;
already used-all stony! The calm wa~ that of death-the&#xD;
composure, that of insensibility-not apathy! Yet there was&#xD;
life in her. There was a new-born energy working within&#xD;
her soul. That had survived the heart-had acquired its&#xD;
strength-only in the utter annihilation of the hope, if not the&#xD;
affections. These still lived, however ;-.--but in what manner?&#xD;
We shall, perhaps, see-as we advance' but they were not now to&#xD;
declare themselves in the ordinary way, as is the case with those&#xD;
who do not live to denial-who still indulge, if not in hope; in&#xD;
dreams-in delirium! Olivia had her purposes still; and, through&#xD;
these, her lingering and blighted aiThetions were still destined to&#xD;
exist, and work ;-but she had no more feminine emotions. The&#xD;
blissful though deceiving reveries of her woman heart were all&#xD;
at an end! There were now no delicious fancies, tripping, like&#xD;
nimble servitors, in obedience to thought or will; bringing gay&#xD;
colors, and creatures of the element, to beguile her saddened&#xD;
moods. Fancy had been stripped of all -its wings---ruthlessly&#xD;
stripped-and life now crept on like the worm deposited beneath&#xD;
the precious flowers, to which it can no longer, fly. But the&#xD;
worm still had life; and a will, which continued to incline in the&#xD;
direction of its former fancies. Olivia de Alvaro, we .repeat,&#xD;
has still a ~urpbse,-whether of hate or love we have yet to&#xD;
learn! Enough, that it is the purpose of a broken heart,-well&#xD;
knowing how complete has been its ruin,-how utterly hopeless&#xD;
is its condition,-how dread its humiliation,-how unrelieved&#xD;
by solace, whether of mind, or heart, or soul. She is without&#xD;
&#xD;
aspirations; yct ~he has a purpose! And that purpose? We shall&#xD;
see as we proceed.&#xD;
Whatever it is, she pursued it with such energies as she has&#xD;
never before displayed in the prosecution of any object. They&#xD;
are such as might become the strongest-willed person of the&#xD;
other sex. She bends her whole soul upon the task. She ex-&#xD;
cludes all fears, all doubts, from consideration-everything&#xD;
which may impair her efforts. Perhaps, we should rather say&#xD;
that, feeling as she does, her souLis no longer accessible to fears.&#xD;
She has endured the last sorrow, and the worst; and death has&#xD;
no terrors, in a sea son, when life is not only without hope, but&#xD;
without inspiration of any kind. She wrought, nevertheless, as&#xD;
one dedicated to duty; as one, too, to whom the strength came,&#xD;
physical and spiritual, only with the duty! An hour had made&#xD;
her a new person; and, with the due consciousness of a fresh&#xD;
impulse, she has no time for sorrows. Sorrows! IJiow should&#xD;
tears, or wailing ,even, or prolonged watching, give testimony&#xD;
to such a woe as hers! To have been capable of either would&#xD;
have implied very inferior sensibilities, or a smaller degree of&#xD;
heart and suffering!&#xD;
A night of stunning ~nd strange sensations, that seemed rather&#xD;
to afflict the body than the mind, and she stood up, a new being!&#xD;
With the dawn she found herself employed,-active, watchfi4,&#xD;
vigilant,-speaking few words, but firmly,-allowing no ques-&#xD;
tions,-wiiing, and causing to be done, according to her will&#xD;
Juana, now honestly prepared to serve, was put in requisition,&#xD;
and kept busy. At night she was required, as we see, to bring&#xD;
her brother, the outlaw, to the chamber of her mistress. When&#xD;
there, the latter had few words, but they exhibited her in a&#xD;
wholly new attitude, to both brother and sister. Juana she dis-&#xD;
missed to irnother chamber. From Mateo, now alone with her,&#xD;
she demanded an account of his interview with Don Balthazar.&#xD;
He revealed its purport-all! Olivia listened without seeming&#xD;
emotion. When he was done, she said:&#xD;
"I have presumed on your fidelity, Mateo. You dare not lie,&#xD;
to me! You will not! I a'm willing to believe you. You are&#xD;
too much of a man to deceive me."&#xD;
"By the Blessed Virgin !"-he began.&#xD;
"Jt does not need, Mateo, that you swear. I will believe you.&#xD;
You shall work for me, and shed no blood! There is your par-&#xD;
don, which I have procured for you through the Lady Isabella;&#xD;
and there is the paper, which makes you and Juana free people-&#xD;
no longer slaves of mine. Take them, and then listen to What I&#xD;
- would have you do."&#xD;

&#xD;
The outlaw fell at her feet,-seized her hand, and covered it&#xD;
with kisses. She withdrew it, indifferently, without emotion.&#xD;
"Enough," she said: "Enough! How bug, Mateo, will it&#xD;
take you to procure me a supply of the roots for making the&#xD;
tawny brQwn dye of the mountains '?"&#xD;
"1 can get you any quantity, Sefiora, in a short twelve hours.~'&#xD;
"Be it so. You must set out for it as soon as I dismiss you."&#xD;
Juana here peered within th&amp;amp; chamber, but the lady motioned&#xD;
her away, and then, in a whisper, gave Mateo some other inst rue.&#xD;
tions. Her manner was calm, resolute, emotionless wholly;&#xD;
her words clear, though whispered; her purpose made fully&#xD;
evident to his understanding, though at present it is withheld&#xD;
from ours. He argued with her purpose, but in vain. He&#xD;
finally submitted ;-Juana was called in, and her brother hur..&#xD;
riedly disappeared. He returned by noon of the next day, and&#xD;
brought her the roots of a native dye, such as she required. He&#xD;
had other trusts to execute, which kept him actively employed.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Juana kept diligent watch. The espionage of Sylvia&#xD;
waLs baffled; and, more than once during the day and night,&#xD;
Mateo penetrated the dwelling in safety,-sometimes with a&#xD;
package beneath his arm; sometimes with only certain tidings&#xD;
on his lips. He wrought submissively, beneath a will which it&#xD;
was neither his policy nor his desire to disobey. Meanwhile,&#xD;
his eyes Illled, rough and savage as he was, as he gazed upon&#xD;
Olivia, and remembered that it was by his agency that her~pride&#xD;
had received its fatal blow-to say nothing of her hope-in the&#xD;
terrible momemit when Philip de Vasconselos had entered the&#xD;
summer-house. But he dared not make this confession.&#xD;
"Yet, how could I help it?" quoth the outlaw, to himself; by&#xD;
way of apology. "He had saved me, had served me, and was&#xD;
a noble gentleman. Then, I knew her only as the kin of that&#xD;
scoundrel, Don Balthazar! Yet~ I wish it had not been so&#xD;
The regret was unavailing, but it strengthened the desire in&#xD;
the heart of the outlaw to serve her faithfully in all things; and&#xD;
it softened him to sw~vey her, so wholly .changed,-a woman no&#xD;
j~nger,-stern, inaccessible, hopeiess,-having but one idea;&#xD;
and that-he shrugged his shoulders as he thought of it.. But he&#xD;
was forbid to argue it again.&#xD;
"I have heard of such things before; but, after all, it's only a&#xD;
sort of madness! She will break down in it, or break out,-and&#xD;
that's pretty much the same thing,-and then it's. all over with&#xD;
her! Oh! it is so pitiful! and she so young, so beautiful, and of&#xD;
such a great family! Demonios! how I should like to cure&#xD;
oil the trouble, if it could be done, by making . three cuts with&#xD;
~rny machete on the black heart of that mQnster, Don Balthazar!&#xD;
&#xD;
A NEW   MYSTERY.                 349.&#xD;
I Would make a cross for him should cross him out forever!&#xD;
Well, let her break down, and 1 shall do it yet! He can't buy&#xD;
me now, at any price. But I shall sell him at just what price I&#xD;
please! Who'll buy on these term~ns? Who? Why the devil,&#xD;

CHAPTER XX IX.&#xD;
Soifri, die poco&#xD;
Ti rimane a soifrir. Non ti spaventi&#xD;
L'aspetto della pena: ii mat peggiore&#xD;
E de' mali ii timor~"&#xD;
IT required, in fact, no effort on the part of Don Balthazar to&#xD;
procure the pardon of Mateo, the outlaw, from the hands of the&#xD;
Adelantado. He had only to place the paper before him, with&#xD;
a crowd of other papers, f~r signature, and the sign-manual was&#xD;
set down without scruple or examination. This was the usual&#xD;
process. It was thus that, at the entreaty of Olivia, the Lady&#xD;
IsabeJla had already procured the pardon ~f the mestizo; and&#xD;
thus it was that the affair had escaped the knowledge of the&#xD;
knight. In neither instance had De Soto been made aware of&#xD;
what he had done, and Don Balthazar was thus naturally kept&#xD;
ignorant of the peculiar interest which his niece had manifested&#xD;
in the outlaw, and of her intimacy with him. He was utterly&#xD;
without suspicion in this quarter; the consequence of his impres-&#xD;
sion of her ignorance of affairs, and of her utter indifference and&#xD;
apathy upon most subjects. The pardon procured, the Don pre-&#xD;
pared the legal discharge~ of Mateo, and his, sister, from the ser-&#xD;
vice of his ward. He signed the latter papers as her guardki~n,&#xD;
and, as usual, without consulting her. The deed of emancipa-&#xD;
tion which she had prepared was, in fact, void, in consequence&#xD;
of her minority; and this was quite as well known to Mateo as&#xD;
to herself. But it was understood between them that he was to&#xD;
keep aloof until she should reach 'maturity, when he could boldly&#xD;
defy the uncle. The parties did not. deceive themselves, or one&#xD;
another; and though the discharge of Olivia was, for the pres-&#xD;
ent, of less value than that of Don Balthazar, still .Mateo much&#xD;
preferred to receive the boon at her hands, though of questiona-&#xD;
ble validity, than to incur any obligation at the hands of a person&#xD;
whom he meditated to murder at the first decent opportunity.&#xD;
Armed with the desired papers, Mateo did not think proper to&#xD;
keep his engagement with the Don. He was to have xIIet him&#xD;
in the thicket, where we have already beheld their interview,&#xD;
but the knight waited for him in vain; and' after lingering&#xD;
for an hour, becoming impatient, he took his way towards&#xD;
the summer-house, and thence proceeded to the dwelling. He&#xD;
little dreamed. that the~person he hoped to see was closely&#xD;

&#xD;
SECRET PLIRPOSES.                851&#xD;
following nd observing all his movements. So was Juana.&#xD;
Mateo ha counselled the latter carefully on certain points,&#xD;
and the atch maintained by one or the other of them left&#xD;
no single proceeding of Don Baithazar, when at home, unno-&#xD;
ticed! hile at the summer-house, the Don had divested him-&#xD;
self of the papers with which he had proposed to meet the out-&#xD;
law. As i was in this neighborhood that ~he still calculated to&#xD;
encounter im, he thought to have them always ready by leaving&#xD;
them ther . He fastened them up securely in a huge chest&#xD;
which he k pt in a closet. But Mateo, who watched all his steps,&#xD;
soon wor ed his way into the closet and the chest. He was&#xD;
armed wit a bit of iron wire, his machete, and a small drill and&#xD;
mallet; an it was surprising with what rapidity he persuaded&#xD;
locks to gi e up their secrets. Such is the advantage of being in&#xD;
high practi e, wherever the arts are concerned. The worthy outlaw,&#xD;
however, d d not immediately possess himself of the documents&#xD;
of the Do . For the present, he was content to know where&#xD;
they were idden. He preferred that their loss should not be&#xD;
discovered until the last moment, when the Don should be&#xD;
ready for departure to Florida, and he to his native moun-&#xD;
tains. He had much yet to do in Havana, and did not care to&#xD;
be disturbed again by the alguazils, while pursuing his pleasant&#xD;
occupation He continued in the employment of Olivia; and~&#xD;
her present purposes, steadily pursued, with a mind now pro-&#xD;
foundly coi centrated on the one object, found him enough to do.&#xD;
But there as a slight interruption to their intercourse. In car-&#xD;
rying out h s purposes, Don Balthazar, as we have seen, had re-&#xD;
solved to end his niece to the plantation,-the hacienda, or&#xD;
country-sea of his ward at Matelos,..-.-.where her large estates&#xD;
chiefly lay. This was in order to his own security. Her~, he&#xD;
might best ractise against her peace-perhaps her life. J~iere,&#xD;
she would e removed from frequent association with the I~ady&#xD;
Isabella, w o had taken a greater interest in her happiness than&#xD;
Don Baltha ar cared to see, or to encourage. She was to pro-&#xD;
ceed thither under the conduct of De Sinolar, whose hacienda was&#xD;
contiguous, and whom Don Balthazar was not unwilling that&#xD;
Olivia shon d marry. De Sinolar was his creature,-silly crea-&#xD;
ture, as we ave seen,.~-vain and weak,-who feared the Don,&#xD;
~and whom he latter regarded as a useful mask to shelter his&#xD;
own proceed ings. If she would wed with De Sinolar, she might&#xD;
live; and t e latter was to be allowed every opportunity of&#xD;
winning his ~way to her favor. Don Balthazar, however, had~ now&#xD;
but little h~pe of this, unless through her utter despair of the&#xD;
knight of P~rtugal, and the desperation of soul which his own&#xD;

&#xD;
cruel conduct had occasioned. The expedition once departed,&#xD;
carrying with it Don Philip, and. the uncle was satisfied to trust&#xD;
somewhat to time.. Time might effect his object, and if not-.&#xD;
the dagger! This latter remedy was to be~entrusted t6 Mateo;&#xD;
unless, indeed, Sylvia should prove herself as expert with the&#xD;
bowl as her predecessor, Anita, had been.&#xD;
According to these plans, Olivia was suddenly apprised that&#xD;
she was to travel that very day under~the escort of De Sinolar.&#xD;
She was silently submissive. She was not allowed words of&#xD;
parting with her friends, the Lady Isabella, or the fair, frail wife&#xD;
of Nuno de Tobar. To this also she was reconciled. She had&#xD;
no desire to see either. She had survived friendship. Mere&#xD;
society had no attractions for her, and nothing compensative.&#xD;
She lived but for a single purpose, and this was of a nature to&#xD;
be rather helped than defeated by her removal from the city ;-.&#xD;
that is to say, by her seeming or temporary removal. She was&#xD;
prepared to go,-but her secret resolution was taken to return;&#xD;
and that, too, before the sailing of the expedition. We shall see,&#xD;
hereafter~ in what manner. Don Balthazar was rather surprised&#xD;
at her submission. He -had expected a struggle. But she heard&#xD;
his requisition with a cold indifference, and answered it with a&#xD;
single word of resignation.&#xD;
"I am ready now&#xD;
He was surprised, and~ said something about her friends.&#xD;
"Would you not desire to see and part with the Lady Isa-&#xD;
liella,-with Leonora de Tobar?"&#xD;
"No! What are friends and friendship to me&#xD;
"It might be done in an hour. It were proper, perhaps."&#xD;
"I do not care to see them."&#xD;
"Well, as you please! You can see them as frequently as&#xD;
you think proper after I am gone. Indeed, as Leonora will re-&#xD;
main in Cuba, you might have her as your guest."&#xD;
Olivia was silent. The uncle proceeded:&#xD;
"De Sinolar has gallantly undertaken to be your escort, and&#xD;
you can command his services during my absence, in any mat-&#xD;
ter in which you may need assistance. He has kindly volun-&#xD;
teered his good offices. I have given him instruction."&#xD;
"When does the expedition sail ?" she coldly inquired.&#xD;
"Within two days. We are all ready, and the wind promises&#xD;
to be fair."&#xD;
She asked no more.&#xD;
"When we separate, Olivia, it may be forever! I go upon&#xD;
an expedition of great peril. I may never return. Do you for-&#xD;
give me, child?"&#xD;

The hacienda o, Matelos was reached in safety about dusk.&#xD;
Oliviapleading fa igue, dismissed Don Augustin to his Own&#xD;
abock, which lay ontiguous, on an adjoining plantation. She&#xD;
retired to her cha ber for awhile, but it was not long before&#xD;
Mateo made his a ~earance. Certain signals, previously agreed&#xD;
upon, announced h s arrival to Juana, and he was stealthily con-&#xD;
ducted by that da sel to the chamber of her mistress. Olivia&#xD;
was sitting with ha ds clasped, and eyes fixed upon a picture of&#xD;
the Virgin which h ng upon the wall opposite, when the outlaw*&#xD;
entered the room. She at once rose.&#xD;
"You are true, Mateo, and I thank you. You musL now get&#xD;
the. horses ready."&#xD;
"Ah! my lady,'~ said the outlaw, "I have been thinking you&#xD;
can never stand this trial. It is a hard life you propose to under-&#xD;
take. You will never have the strength for it. You do not&#xD;
know the toil, the danger. You will surely sink under it; you&#xD;
will perish, and there will be no one to help you."&#xD;
"I shall need no help, Mateo; and if I .perish, it is only an&#xD;
end of a long and terrible struggle."&#xD;
"But why engage in this struggle, Sefiorita? Of what avail ?"&#xD;
"The easiest form of death is in the struggle, Mateo. Do not&#xD;
argue with me now; I am resolved."&#xD;
"But, I must argue, dearest mistress-I, who know what are&#xD;
the toils of such a life, day by ~Iay, on the back of a horse."&#xD;
"You forget, Mateo, that my father taught me how to ride;&#xD;
that I have been a horse-rider from my childhood, over the rug.&#xD;
gedest mountain passes. I fear no steed that was e~er bridled.&#xD;
My poor father, you remember him, Mateo'?"&#xD;
"Ah! my lady, do I not? Had he lived, I should never have&#xD;
been a bad fellow; never been an outlaw,-never shed human&#xD;
blood."&#xD;
"Weff~ as he had no son, lie made a boy of me, and taught me&#xD;
the exercises of boyhood. He showed me the uses of the match-&#xD;
lock and the cross-bow, until I ceased to fear the shock and the re-&#xD;
port of fire-arms, and could bring down the mountain eagle with&#xD;
my arrows. I have grown into the \voman, but I have never lost&#xD;
the spirit, nor the practice, which he taught me. Toil, trial, dan-&#xD;
ger, have no fears for me. I am bolder and braver now than ever.&#xD;
Do you have no apprehensions, my good Mateo; for there is that&#xD;
in my soul now which makes me laugh at danger."&#xD;
The outlaw continued to expostulate, when she abruptly and&#xD;
sternly silenced him.&#xD;
"Have you not sworn to serve me, Mateo, without question-&#xD;

have still entreated, but she spoke decidedly.&#xD;
I tell you, I am resolute as death. Do as I corn-&#xD;
tell me that you will do nothing. I will then seek&#xD;
who thinks himself less wise, and proves more&#xD;
ot angry with me, dear .Se~orita. I am not wise,&#xD;

would be sensible and proper. But-you know,&#xD;

&#xD;
where the saddled steed was in waiting. It was an hour short of&#xD;
midnight. The stars were few in heaven. The gusts swept, with&#xD;
a sad soughing, through the woods, and seemed filled with mourn.&#xD;
ful and warning voices. The ear of the outlaw was sensible to&#xD;
the sounds, and his more superstitious nature held them to be&#xD;
ominous. But Olivia seemed not to hear or heed them. She&#xD;
wrung the hand of Juana in silence, leapt into the saddle, and, fol.&#xD;
lowed by Mateo on horseback also, she turned once more in the&#xD;
direction of Havana. Juana remained behind to plead the indis-&#xD;
position of her mistress, and baffle, for awhile, the curiosity of iDe&#xD;
Sinolar.&#xD;
The wayfarers rode hard and fast. In a low and seemingly un-&#xD;
occupied hovel in the suburbs of the city, we find Olivia safely&#xD;
housed before daylight. The place had been selected and pro.&#xD;
cured for her by Mateo, agreeably to previous instructions. There&#xD;
was a rude couch, upon which she rested for awhile. But not long.&#xD;
She was soon up and busy. Mateo was summoned, and was&#xD;
promptly in attendance.&#xD;
"Are all the things here, Mateo ?"&#xD;
"You will find them in that box my lady."&#xD;
"Have you prepared-"&#xD;
"Every thing, Sefiorita. I have done all; I am ready for all&#xD;
things: but 0! my lady, it is not yet too late."&#xD;
"What do you fear, Mateo ?"&#xD;
"Every thing for you, Sei'iorita-nothing for myself. Nay,&#xD;
if you will believe me, I would sooner cut for you the throats of&#xD;
a dozen such villains as Don Balthazar, than see you go on this&#xD;
fearful business."&#xD;
"Nay, Mateo, I wish no throats cut for me! Still less that&#xD;
"Oh L if you would only listen to me, Senorita."&#xD;
She answered with a strange smile, and so calmly, that he was&#xD;
disturbed by the very repose of tier voice and manner, as it ar-&#xD;
gued a resolution so utterly immovable.&#xD;
"Well,-what would you say, Mateo?"&#xD;
The poor fellow could only repeat what he had so idly urged&#xD;
already.&#xD;
"Say, my lady, say ?-Why, I would say that you know not&#xD;
what it is you are about to undertake and undergo! That you&#xD;
are not fit--not strong enough !-" /&#xD;
"Is it fatigue, pain, peril, loss of life, the agony of wounds?&#xD;
I am prepared for all these! Must I repeat to you that I should&#xD;
gladly welcome either, or all, of these, if I could lose those hor-&#xD;
rors which oppress me now! Horrors! but if you know not-"&#xD;
&#xD;
"But if y u are discovered?"&#xD;
"AhI that is the terror! that 4"-after a pause: "But I must&#xD;
brave it! 1 ell you, Mateo, I cannot remain here! 1 cannot sur-&#xD;
vive thus! must extort from new griefs, troubles, privations&#xD;
and dangers, Such7-excitement as shall obliterate the past! I&#xD;
know not wh t you know, of my cause of agony; but I suspect,&#xD;
Mateo, that ou know enough to understand that I can fly to&#xD;
nothing wors , in the shape of woe, than I have already had to&#xD;
meet! If yo know this, be silent! If you are prepared to&#xD;
serve me fait fully, be submissive! Let me have no further en-&#xD;
treaty."&#xD;
"The Virgi be with youmy dear lady, and bring you help and&#xD;
succor! I go to do all as you have commanded."&#xD;
With thes words he left her. She closed and fastened the&#xD;
door behind im; and, for a while, stood where she had been&#xD;
speaking; wh lly absorbed in thought; looking like a statue ra-&#xD;
ther than a b eating woman! Then she spoke, half in prayer,&#xD;
half in solilo uy:&#xD;
"Ay! the blessed Virgin! Succor! Succor! I surely need her&#xD;
help! Woul she have come sooner! Oh! how wild the path-&#xD;
way seems be ore me! What clouds, how torh! How flitting&#xD;
with the wind: and what a crowd of changing and frightful as-&#xD;
pects! They drift along, with the force of the tempest, which&#xD;
they vainly o r to resist! Now, they cry to one another for help&#xD;
and succor! ut they disappear, even as they cry, swallowed up&#xD;
in the fearful oid, and making way for, other forms and aspects!&#xD;
There is no s n, no moon, no stars; but there is a light as from&#xD;
the eyes of d ath; sepulchral, and filled with myriads of floating&#xD;
spectres! W at can it mean! Where am I! What do I see?&#xD;
Ah! these ar Hernan de Soto, and his troops and followers!&#xD;
That is Nun de Tobar: yonder rides-Oh! how my heart&#xD;
loathes him a he rides !-and yonder is-Oh! Blessed Virgin,&#xD;
it~ is. myself see! But the spectre lives and moves,-and&#xD;
serves! It is Don Philip that charges away in front-away!&#xD;
away! and- ee, how the boy follows him! Ah!.. .&#xD;
The highly wrought and febrile condition of Olivia's brain,&#xD;
must account or her apparent vhAon, in which she sees the known&#xD;
and the conjec ured; in which she mingles a past knowledge with&#xD;
her owu futur purposes. The madness lasted but for a brief&#xD;
space! She eemed suddenly to recover, and sank upon her&#xD;
knees before t~ie image of the Virgin. She now prayed inaudi-&#xD;
bly; then ros4, calm,-rigid rather in every muscle, and then pro-&#xD;
ceeded to unfo~d the contents of trunks and chests, as if with the&#xD;
view of makin~ her toilet. Let us leave her to this performance.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
"I have surely seen him:&#xD;
His favor is familiar to me.&#xD;
Boy, thou hast looked thyself into my grace,&#xD;
And art mine own."&#xD;
&#xD;
CYMBEUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE eighteenth day of May, in the year of grace, one thou.&#xD;
sand, five hundred and thirty-nine-more than three hundred&#xD;
years ago !-~-was marked with a white stone in the calendar of&#xD;
Don Ilernan de Soto; for, on that day, his squadron, eight large&#xD;
vessels (~small-sized schooners of our days), a caravel (a sloop)&#xD;
and two brigantines-things with scarce a deck at all-sailed from&#xD;
the noble harbor of Havana, with their proWs turned east in the&#xD;
direction of the opposite coast of Florida. But it was rather&#xD;
late in the day before they took their departure; and though&#xD;
the armament had been supposed in readiness several days be.&#xD;
fore, yet, when the time came, there were many things that re-&#xD;
quired to be hurried. Of these, the Adelantado had his share:&#xD;
and Don Balthazar more than his share; all needing to be at-&#xD;
tended to, and ~sped. But, of the cares of these great personages,&#xD;
we will say nothing in this place. They scarcely affect our nar.&#xD;
native. We shall confine ourselves to those of Don Philip de&#xD;
Vasconselos, chiefly; and relate how he was provided With a&#xD;
Moorish page, almost at the last moment, and on the most libe-&#xD;
ral terms.&#xD;
The sun was just warming the tops of the Cuban mountains,&#xD;
when the good knight was summoned to the entrance of his lodg-&#xD;
ings, to hearken to an unexpected visitor. This was noother&#xD;
than our old acquaintance, Mateo, the outlaw. Don Philip was&#xD;
on the alert, and was not found napping even at that early hour.&#xD;
He was busy brushing up his armor; condensing his wardrobe&#xD;
into the smallest possible compass; preparing his steed and fur-&#xD;
niture; for transfer to one of the caravels where a place had been&#xD;
appointed him; and adjusting his affairs, in general, for that re-&#xD;
moval which had now become inevitable.&#xD;
Don Philip met the outlaw with a grave, but gentle welcome;&#xD;
spoke and looked him kindly; and asked what he could do for&#xD;
him. The sight of the features of the Portuguese knight, seemed&#xD;
to occasion some difficulty in the speech of the outlaw. The&#xD;
sadnes~, approaching confirmed melancholy, which his face wore,&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MESTIZO'S GIFT.               359&#xD;
and which th~tones of his voice so well expressed, reminded Ma-&#xD;
teo of many matters, and in particular, of one very terrible scene,&#xD;
in which he ad beheld the brave cavalier wounded to the vej~y&#xD;
soul; crushe , as it were, into the earth, and partly by his&#xD;
proceedings. The whole scene came back to both parties as&#xD;
they met; a d, as the gloom darkened on the visage of Don&#xD;
Philip, the md of Mateo became agitated and confused, in a&#xD;
way wholly nwonted with the rough, wild, half-savage charac-&#xD;
ter of the -A! stizo. But he plucked up resolution to reply, and&#xD;
in tones as si nple and unconstrained as possible.&#xD;
"Well, Se or, it's not so much what you cat~ do for me, as&#xD;
what I can d for you !-You've been wanting a page or squire,&#xD;
Seflor," said he outlaw, "and you haven't got one yet ?"&#xD;
"It is true, Mateo. I did not like the looks of any that were&#xD;
brought me. Can you help me to one? Do you know ?-"&#xD;
"I can provide you with a Page, Setior; not a servant; a&#xD;
young lad, a kinsman, a nephew of my own; brown like myself,&#xD;
but the child pf a free woman of the mountains; who has heard&#xD;
of you, and 1ould like to see a little of the world, and of ar..&#xD;
mies, under s ch a brave leader; but he can't be bought. He's.&#xD;
the son of a free woman, Sefior, as I tell you, and will serve you&#xD;
for love, not or money; and will bring his own horse, and pro-&#xD;
vide his own ~means; and will only expect to be treated kindly,&#xD;
and to be taught; the art of war; and-"&#xD;
"Will he s]~ibmit-will he obey me&#xD;
"Certainly,~ as a page, Seflor: and will be happy tQ do so. I&#xD;
can answer fo all that, Seflor. He will do for you, I am sure,&#xD;
as no bondma would ever do-will be faithful always-and be&#xD;
very glad wh n you employ him, for he is pleased with you,&#xD;
Seflor,-he h s seen you often, and admires you very much!&#xD;
He longs to g with you, and hasn't let me rest, for the last week,&#xD;
for urging me to come to you and make the offer. He don't&#xD;
want pay-he has means of his own, as I told you: his moth-&#xD;
er, a free wo an of the mountains, Sefior, has property; cattle&#xD;
and horses; nd though the boy is quite young, and slightly&#xD;
built, yet he h s health and strength, and can stand a good deal&#xD;
of trouble an fatigue; all he wants is to be with you ;-that is,&#xD;
to see war un er your lead ;-and as he's the son of a free wo-&#xD;
man, SeftorJ thought it right, perhaps, that he should have such&#xD;
desires, and should l~am from the best teacher."&#xD;
"Bring him to m~, Mateo."&#xD;
"He is here at ha~d-I could. not well keep him away, Seflor.&#xD;
He is 80 anxious !"&#xD;
Here the outlaw tt~rned away for a moment from the lodge of&#xD;

&#xD;
the knight, and, stepping down to the highway, he gave a slight&#xD;
halloo. In sight, stood a boy holding a stout arid spirited steed.&#xD;
He approached at the signal, leading the horse. When he drew&#xD;
nigh, the knight, who had retired into the lodge for a moment,&#xD;
reappeared, and gazed steadily upon the new-corner.&#xD;
," Let the boy fasten the horse to yon sapling, Mateo, and&#xD;
draw nigh, that I may have some talk with him. He has a fine&#xD;
horse, Mateo."&#xD;
"Yes, Sefior, I raised him myself. He walks like the wind,&#xD;
and will go like an eagle to the charge. Suppose- ydu step out,&#xD;
and look at him closely, SeIlor. You must love a fine animal,&#xD;
Senior, and this is one for a brave man to love, without feeling&#xD;
ashamed of his choice."&#xD;
How the heart, already vittdly sore, applies the most remote&#xD;
allusion to the cause of its secret suffering! This casual remark&#xD;
of Mateo, smote on the sensibilities of Philip de Vasconselos,&#xD;
like a sneer. But the face of Mateo was innocent of any occult&#xD;
meaning; and Philip showed that he felt, simply by an increased&#xD;
solemnity of voice and visage. He followed the outlaw out to&#xD;
where the horse stood, still held by the boy in waiting. The&#xD;
first regards of the knight were given entirely to the steed.&#xD;
"He is certainly a very fine animal, Mateo. You do not&#xD;
praise him more than he deserves.~~&#xD;
"See what a chest he-carries, Seflor, broad like a castle. See&#xD;
what legs, so clcan, so wiry. There's not an ounce of fat to&#xD;
spare from., those quarters. There's not a long hair that you'd&#xD;
like to pull out from those fetlocks. And, look at his eye&#xD;
It's like that of a great captain! ~2ortez, I warrant, does not&#xD;
open a finer when he looks down from the towers of the Mexi-&#xD;
can. See what a mane of silk! It is like the hair of a Princess.&#xD;
And he's young, but a quarter over four, Sefior; and he comes&#xD;
of a breed that lasts till forty."&#xD;
"Unless no shaft from an Apalachian savage cuts him short;"&#xD;
was the remai'k of Vasconselos, sadly made, as'he turned to be-&#xD;
stow a look upon the boy.&#xD;
There seemed to be a new interest springing into the eyes of&#xD;
Philip as he gazed. The boy was of fine, dark bronze complex-&#xD;
ion, looking more like the native race of Indians, than the Afes-&#xD;
tizo cross, from which he was said to have sprung: he was well&#xD;
made, and symmetrical; with good limbs and much grace of out-&#xD;
line. But Vasconselos dwelt not so much upon the form, as&#xD;
the face, of the youth. This seemed to rivet his attention for&#xD;
awhile. And the effect of his gaze was to disquiet the boy him-&#xD;
self'; and Mateo, his uncle. The former closed his eyes, involun'&#xD;
&#xD;
tarily, under the st adfast glance of the knight; and th~ outlaw&#xD;
hurriedly said:&#xD;
"The boy is has ful, Sefior: he has never before stood in the&#xD;
presence of a grea captain, or a knight, or even a fine gentle-&#xD;
man. He is from the mountains, as I said, and don't know&#xD;
about the fine beh vior of a young man of the city, who is al-&#xD;
ways expected to 'qok up, you know, as if he was born to&#xD;
say to the sun-' s op a little-I must talk with yeu.' Now,&#xD;
Juan-"                 -&#xD;
"Juan ?-Is that is name 2"&#xD;
"Yes, Juan, Seio ; his mother's name is Juana, a free woman&#xD;
of the mountains, nor-"&#xD;
"His face remii ds me very much of one that I have seen&#xD;
somewhere. I have certainly seen him before, Mateo."&#xD;
"Never him, S flor,-never !" replied the other sturdily.&#xD;
"Juan has never b en to the city before last week; and you, I&#xD;
know, have never een into the mountains, Seflor. He is a&#xD;
mountain boy, you Excellency,-.-.-son of a free woman of the&#xD;
mountains. He ha seen you, but you could not have seen him&#xD;
before. But what's in a likeness, Sefior? You will see them&#xD;
every day, every w ere. I have seen thousands of likenesses,&#xD;
in my time, for whi h there was not the slightest bit of reason.&#xD;
Now, Juan looks like several people I knew, and you may have&#xD;
seen them. He lo k's very 'like Antonio Morelos, a creole of'&#xD;
Havana, here. Yo must have seen kim. Then, he looks mon-&#xD;
strous like hi~ moth r, and she has been a thousand times to the&#xD;
city. Oh! likeness s are nothing now, we see so many~ You&#xD;
never could have se n our Juan's face before, Seflor."&#xD;
Mateo talked rapi ly, rather than earnestly, as if against time&#xD;
and the wind. Vase nselos did not seem to hear half what he&#xD;
was saying. He St 11 kept an earnest~ eye upon the boy, as if&#xD;
deeply interested; e idently communing with every feature of&#xD;
his face-..-as far, th t is to say, as he was allowed to see them.&#xD;
lut the boy's eyes ere cast down.. lie saw nothing; yet felt,&#xD;
evidently, that the k en eyes of the knight were upon him.&#xD;
"The boy is you g, very young, Mateo, and I very much fear&#xD;
will hardly be able to stand the fatigues of such a campaign as&#xD;
that we shall have t endure in - Florida."&#xD;
"Oh! he is stro ~g, Seilor. His looks are deceptive. He&#xD;
comes of a h~rdy ra e. He can stand fire and water."&#xD;
"But he deems usually timid. Art thou sure that he has&#xD;
courage? Will he ook danger in the eye?"&#xD;
The boy seen~ed lisposed- to answer for himself. He looked&#xD;
up-he looked Doi Philip in the eye, and without ble.nching.&#xD;

&#xD;
Nay, there was so much of a settled calm-an unflinching reso.&#xD;
lution in~his sudden glance, that the knight was~ struck with it.&#xD;
"Certainly," quoth he, "that was something like a lightening&#xD;
up of the spirit. He is capable of flashes, Mateo."&#xD;
* "Ay, and of fire and flame too Seflor! Faggots! Give him&#xD;
time, your Excellency, and you will see the blaze. But he's&#xD;
naturally bashful when you're looking on' him. It's not a bad&#xD;
sign in a bty, Sefior."&#xD;
"No, truly! But I like his looks, Mateo. There is some.&#xD;
thing in those features that please me much. Were I sure of&#xD;
the strength and courage of the boy,.-his capacity to endure,-.&#xD;
I should not hesitate: I should feel sure of his fidelity."&#xD;
"Oh! that I can promise, Seflor. He's as faithful to the man&#xD;
he loves as if he were a woman."&#xD;
"Pity but ;he were more so !" responded the knight quickly.&#xD;
The outlaw felt that he had blundered, and he promptly strove&#xD;
to recover his false step.&#xD;
"As a woman is expected to be, your Excellency; that's what&#xD;
I mean! I can answer for Juan; for his courage, his hardihood,&#xD;
not less than his honesty, Seflor. He's a boy of good princi-&#xD;
ples."&#xD;
"Let him answer for himself! Somehow, Mateo, I am a little&#xD;
doubtful of your answers. You are.too quick to be quite sure of&#xD;
what you say! hark ye, Juan, are you sure you desire to go&#xD;
with me, to Florida ?"&#xD;
The boy evidently trembled: but promptly enough, in a rather&#xD;
hoarse voice, answered-&#xD;
"Yes, Seflor! I wish to go with you."&#xD;
The voice was a strange one, yet, its tones seemed to interest&#xD;
the knight, as if there was something familiar in them also.&#xD;
"He has a very peculiar voice, Mateo."&#xD;
"Yes, Seflor, strange enough to those who heard him only a&#xD;
year ago. Now, his voice is getting the cross 'twixt man and&#xD;
boy. It's rather more a squeak than a ~ong, your Excellency.&#xD;
But I reckon, Seflor, we all underwent some such change about&#xD;
the same time in our lives."&#xD;
Don Philip.'; But, my good boy, you don't know the toil and&#xD;
trouble; the daily marching in that country; where there are&#xD;
no roads; only rank forests, great swamps, wild beasts, deadly&#xD;
reptiles; where, half the time, y o~u may be without food; and&#xD;
perhaps, quite as frequently withoi~t water.&#xD;

And .if he don't live long, he'll only be more sure of being young&#xD;

Philip. Logical enough, Mateo; yet I have no wish to shorten&#xD;
his days.&#xD;
"Try. me, Seflor," murmured the boy, in very low but ear..&#xD;
nest tones, not daring to look up. There was a pleasant change&#xD;
in the voice, which seemed to interest the hearer. lie put his&#xD;
hand on the head of the boy, who started from under the touch,&#xD;
and visibly trembled. But Philip was not permitted to see his&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Do you not overrate both your courage and, your strength,&#xD;
my boy? You start and tremble at my touch."&#xD;
~' 'Tis not with fear, Sei'ior 1" was the ~ubdued reply, still in&#xD;
the same low, sweet accents,&#xD;
"No! For why should you fear me, child ~ But you seem&#xD;
naturally timid-nervous, I should say ;-and such wars as that&#xD;
we go upon, require hardihood above all other things. There&#xD;
must be no~agitation when the trumpet rings the alarm. There&#xD;
must be no faltering when we are bade to charge. The j~age of'&#xD;
the knight will be expected to do good service, and to follow&#xD;
close after his master, even if he does not emulate him. Caust&#xD;
thou carry a lance, Juan ~"&#xD;
"I am provided with a cross-bow, Sefior, and can shoot. The&#xD;
lance will come-"&#xD;
"Thou art so eager for it, Juan "&#xD;
"Oh! take me with you, Seflor !"&#xD;
"I like thee, boy. Thou hast something about thee which ap-&#xD;
peals strangely to my imagination."&#xD;
And the good knight sighed deeply. His instincts, rather than&#xD;
his memory,. perhaps, guided his asseTerations. The boy hung&#xD;
his head also. He dared not, at that moment, look up in the&#xD;
face of Don Philip.&#xD;
"I will take thee with me, boy, and fight thy battles, if need&#xD;
be; will keep thee as much from harm as possible, and share&#xD;
with thee my spoils----"&#xD;
"I ask nothing, Sefior 1" said the ~boy hastily.&#xD;
"Oh! no, Seflor 1" quoth Mateo. \" My sister is a free woman&#xD;
of the mountains. Her son is able to pay his own way. He&#xD;
wishes to go to see service and learn a profession, and will share&#xD;
no one's spoil. He hopes to make his own. Besides, my sister&#xD;
is resolute that her son shall take no pay for his services. Re-&#xD;

MASSXuGEU. fihe Roman Actor.&#xD;
BUT we are not fet permitted to depart, and must follow, for&#xD;
a brief space, the fortunes of some other of our dramatispersonw.&#xD;
The novelist cannot do always, as he would, with his own cre.&#xD;
nations. He cannot linger, always with those whom~ he prefers.&#xD;
We must suffer the Fates to exercise their controlling agencies&#xD;
just as certainly as they do in real life, and among the living peo.&#xD;
pie whom we know~. He may create, but he cannot control. It&#xD;
is upon this very condition that he is permitted to create. The&#xD;
Being, once filled with the breath of life, and having made his&#xD;
appearance upon the stage of human action, must thenceforward&#xD;
conform to necessitks over which the author exercises no authority.&#xD;
These wUl have their origin in the character, the actions, and the&#xD;
impulses, of his pei~sons; in the events which flow from their&#xD;
performances; in their conflicts with rival actors, on the scene;&#xD;
in their strength or imbecility; with some allowance made for&#xD;
the operation of external causes, which, we are told, will always,&#xD;
more or less, affect~ the destinies equally of mice and men! Let&#xD;
us leave Philip do Vas~onse1os, and the dusky page, J~an, to their&#xD;
progress over the blue waters of the gulf, while we follow the&#xD;
steps of Mateo, the outlaw.&#xD;
As soon as the Mestizo had closed the arrarigemenfr, by which&#xD;
his "nephew, the son of a free woman of the mountains," had&#xD;
been secured a place in the service of the knight of Portugal, he&#xD;
disappeared from the, vicinity of~ the Spanish encampment. He&#xD;
had, we may mention, trised some precautions when "about town,"&#xD;
by which he had k~pt his person from all -unnecessary exposure.&#xD;
He had still some decent regard for the existence of a class of'&#xD;
per'~ons, the Aiguazils, with whom he entertained few special&#xD;
sympathies; and, in leaving the lodgings of Vasconselos, he had&#xD;
stolen away into covert, by the most secluded passages. A sin-&#xD;
gle moment, in private, and i~nder the cover of a clump of trees,&#xD;
densely packed, with shrubbery, had sufficed for his parting with&#xD;

him seemed to mu~mur of repose. The inanimate life of the&#xD;
forest declared nc~ unrest-no unruly passions,-no wretched&#xD;
discontent. The s~y was now beautifully clear, and.' if a voice&#xD;
was heard besides his own, it was that only of some very tiny&#xD;
bird, such as harbors only in the stunted shrubbery, where a sin-&#xD;
gle leaf will afford instant and close shelter for its form. But the&#xD;
very repose spoke to the violent passions of the outlaw, with a&#xD;
stimulating accent.&#xD;
"Ah !"' said he, "If I only had him here ! "and he clenched his&#xD;
fist savagely.&#xD;
"But I must ~get those. papers! lie will be in the camp&#xD;
soon to-day: He will be among the last to sail. In an hour, he&#xD;
will have left the hacienda. But may he not return to it, in&#xD;
the hope to see m~, and to learn that I have done his work?&#xD;
Perhaps; but hardly! He will scarce have time! Humph!&#xD;
Done his work! ii must do my dwn! Verily, if I meet him&#xD;
there, I will do it thoroughl5r! Shall I cut throats except to my&#xD;
own liking? By the Blessed Devils, no! I will cut his throat&#xD;
if I can! And if I do, what is to keep me from the expedition?&#xD;
I am a man for the ~vars. I will see how the lances cross with&#xD;
the shock of thunder. But I must get me those papers. lie&#xD;
little dreams that I know their hiding-place. When he goes to&#xD;
th~ city this morning, it will be to make ready.. He will hardly&#xD;
return to the hacienda. Then will I take possession. Juana&#xD;
knows what to do. When the ships have all gone, she goes off&#xD;
to the mountains. She will 15e doubly safe with the papers of the&#xD;
Seflorita, and of th4 Uncle-devil. She shall be safe! Then, if&#xD;
1 should find him t1z~re, and ~fe~l my way into his ribs, we are all'&#xD;
safe! Oh! If I should only find him there! If he goes on&#xD;
this expedition, will my poor lady be safe a moment? No!&#xD;
No! There's no blinding his snake-eyes! He will see, and I&#xD;
know there will be trouble-and more than trouble ;-there will&#xD;
be a great danger always in the path of the good knight Oh!&#xD;
it must .be that I shall split his black heart with my knife, and&#xD;
let out all its poison with its blood! It must be, when there's&#xD;
so much good to coipe of it-when there's no safety for anybody&#xD;
while he lives!' I owe him a stroke of my machete! And if&#xD;
the Blessed Devils give me half a chance, I will pay him with a&#xD;
vengeance 1"&#xD;
We have here the passions of the outlaw's s6ul, and the&#xD;
plans of his mind, fairly mingled up together, in that sort of web&#xD;
of thought, which is the usual mental process in the setisuous&#xD;
nature. Don Balthazar, at this moment little dreamed of the&#xD;
danger which threatened him. While Mateo, making his gray&#xD;

lie now knew himself to be at the mercy of this cavalier, so far&#xD;

secret, he well new, would be fatal to his reputation in Cuba,&#xD;
and the army ;-so long as the government o both was adminis-&#xD;

security for his ecret, in the very regard wh ch Philip de Vas-&#xD;

Philip would pr bably.~be silent, in respect t that which would&#xD;
hurt her reputaf on. But who was to secure the unfaithful guar-&#xD;
dian against the speech of Olivia herself? H r passionate blood&#xD;
had evidently e caped wholly from the co trol of her tyrant.&#xD;
He had made er desperate, in making he desolate; and he&#xD;
felt that, in deat alone, could his safety be made certain. He&#xD;
knew the nature of passionate women too wel ; and now perceiv-&#xD;
ed that Olivia, i this respect, too much rese bled her Biscayan&#xD;
mother, of who his experience was suflicien ly vivid, and who,&#xD;
he well knew, n the madness of her awa ened passions, had&#xD;
neither fear nor prudence, nor scruple of any s rt. He trembled,&#xD;
accordingly; pr~ ud, fearless and powerful a he was; lest the&#xD;
reckless, or the thoughtless word .of either t e knight of Portu-&#xD;
gal or Olivia de Alvaro, should, at any mom nt, hurl him head-&#xD;
long from positi n, making him odious to all, and subjecting him&#xD;
to legal, as well as social, persecution. W y had not the out~&#xD;
law, Mateo, don his work upon the knight? There were surely&#xD;
opportunities en not. and Mateo was too w 11 known; as a des-&#xD;
perado, to supp se that he had either moral s rules, or personal&#xD;
fears! The qu stion troubled the Don, sine , from his own con-&#xD;
jectures, he vain y sought an answer.&#xD;
While he me stated these doubts, an aide of the Adelantado&#xD;
arrived, and br ught him dispatches from on Reman, which&#xD;
required his ear y presence in the city. He dismissed the mes-&#xD;
senger with a re l~y which promised that he w uld soon be there,&#xD;
and was now si ply making his final prepare ions for joining the&#xD;
expedition, and superintending the work of inbarkation. The&#xD;
officer disappear d, riding fast, and was seen at a distance, as he&#xD;
left the hacienda by the approaching outlaw.&#xD;
"Demonios!' muttered Mateo, between his closed teeth,&#xD;
"there goes my last chance! Had I come a hour sooner!"&#xD;
He had zuista en the rider for Don Baltha r. He now more&#xD;

&#xD;
leisurely continued his progress, and at length found himself&#xD;
amidst the silent groves surrounding the summer-house of the&#xD;
knight,-that lovely and secluded lodge which had been so fruit.&#xD;
ful in events affecting the destinies of some of the persons of our&#xD;
drama. It was fated to furnish yet another scene of dcep inter-&#xD;
est to the parties.&#xD;
Don Balthazar, burning or preserving papers, arranging arms,&#xD;
and armor, was busy and thoughtful in his chamber, when the&#xD;
old hag, Sylvia, suddenly burst into the apartment. He looked&#xD;
up at the intrusion, with a haughty frown; but she was not ap-&#xD;
palled by it. She was wild 'with excitement; and her sinister&#xD;
and withered features were now absolutely fiendish in the expres-&#xD;
sion of rage which they exhibited. She ~ould scarcely speak, so&#xD;
agitating were her emotions. When she did succeed in giving&#xD;
utterance to the cause of her excitement, she was surprised to&#xD;
find that her master did not partake of her wrath, and seemed&#xD;
lightly to listen to her communications.&#xD;
"He is here, Seilor;" she exclaimed,-" the villain, Mateo;&#xD;
the outlaw; the murderer; the robber of the old woman! He&#xD;
is here, Senor, in the groves; he is even now gone to the garden&#xD;
h6use !"&#xD;
Mateo had evidently neglected his usual precautions. Satis-&#xD;
fied that the horseman whom he had seen pushing for the city, at&#xD;
full speed, was Don Balthazar himself; he had been at no pains&#xD;
to make his movements secret.&#xD;
"Ah! he is here, then,-Mateo?" and.thc knight smiled with&#xD;
a grim complaisance, and muttered, sotto voce-" He has done it,&#xD;
then, perhaps, and comes for his reward! Good! He knows his&#xD;
time, and has, no doubt, done it efficiently! Well! I must see&#xD;
him."&#xD;
He at once rose, and, with his sword only at his side, moved&#xD;
quickly from the chamber. Sylvia was quite confounded; and&#xD;
followed, muttering her surprise as she went. Don Balthazar&#xD;
never once looked behind, and did not see, her; or he wQuld&#xD;
have dismissed her with severity. And then !-But we must not&#xD;
anticipate ~&#xD;
He hurried on; and so rapid were his movements, that the&#xD;
stiffened limbs of the old woman utterly failed to enable her to&#xD;
keep any sort of pace with the progress which he made. He&#xD;
was soon in the groves; had soon overpasses the space; and,&#xD;
walking in the buckskin shoes, the use of which the Spaniards&#xD;
had borrowed from the red men,-wearingthern\ commonly when in&#xD;
their peaceful avocations -he entered the garden house unheard.&#xD;
He was confounded at what he beheld.' The outlaw had coolly&#xD;

&#xD;
"Villain, would you murder me ~" gasped the cavalier, vainly&#xD;
struggling to rise, and making efforts as desperate as unavailing.&#xD;
"You have come for it! I thought you safe, and Ecursed the&#xD;
Blessed Devils, that helped you off. But I did 'em wrong! They&#xD;
have delivered you into my hands! You thought to buy me, did&#xD;
you, to kill the good knight of Portugal? I'll kill you for him!&#xD;
I'll kill you for the poor young lady, my mistress! Oh! didn't&#xD;
I see, with my own e~yes, just as Don Philip saw? You ought&#xD;
to die a hundred deaths! But, as it's only once for you as for&#xD;
other men, the sooner you taste it, the sooner you get your wages.&#xD;
You shan't have time to say a prayer; not one: for you shan't&#xD;
have any mercy from God any more than from me! Die! I&#xD;
gay; die! Die! Die!"&#xD;
The knight succumbed; he had neither room nor strength for&#xD;
struggle. Hands and head buried in the chest, and face down-&#xD;
wards, he was helpless! The hoarse gurgle of his breath in the&#xD;
throat was already painful to the ear, and the writings of his&#xD;
form were those of a man vainly struggling with the last potent&#xD;
enemy; when, suddenly, a sound was heard by the writhing and&#xD;
pimost suffocated man,-a sound,-a stroke !-another, and ano-&#xD;
ther !-and the gripe of his enemy relaxed; and there wa~ a wild&#xD;
yell above him ;-but one !-and Don Balthazar felt relieved.&#xD;
He began once more to breathe. He felt no longer the incum-&#xD;
bent weight of the gigantic ruffian upon his back! Gradually, he&#xD;
recovered consciousness. He heard a voice calling him by name.&#xD;
He felt hands officiously helping him to rise; he felt a cool but&#xD;
grateful shock of~ water. His eyes opened to the day once more.&#xD;
lie looked about him: slowly, but fully, at length his ~1ance&#xD;
took in the objects around him. He found himtLself sehted beside&#xD;
the chest, from which he had been rolled out rather than lifted;&#xD;
and, before him, stiff in death, lay the corse of the outlaw, who,&#xD;
but a little before, had been so completely in his power! The&#xD;
old hag, Sylvia, stood at hand to help her master, and soon ex-&#xD;
plained the agency by which his life had been saved. She had&#xD;
followed him to the summer-house, curious to see and hear, and&#xD;
anxious for the recovery of her goods, of which Mateo had de-&#xD;
prived her. She had come not a moment too soon! Seeing the&#xD;
knight's danger, she had caught up the hatchet which was em-&#xD;
ployed for trimming the trees and shrubbery of the grove, and&#xD;
which ~Iay in the verandah of the summer-house, convenient, with&#xD;
saw and other implements; and, without a word,-'governed by&#xD;
instincts which always prompt to decisive action where the mind&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
"Master, go on, and I will follow thee&#xD;
To the last gasp, with truth and loyaltyy"&#xD;
As You Lint, IT.&#xD;
IT was a goodly hour after the event, before Don Balthazar&#xD;
had sufficiently recovered from his sufferings to resume his acti-&#xD;
vity, or comply with the summons of the Adelantado, to return&#xD;
to the city. When able to rise and look about him, he gave his&#xD;
orders with customary sang froid, for the removal and disposi-&#xD;
tion of th~ dead body of the outlaw, which was publicly exposed&#xD;
during the day, and finally hungjn chains by the public execu-&#xD;
tioner. But this exhibition did not take place till after the de-&#xD;
parture of the expedition; and the good Knight of Portugal, and&#xD;
his page Juan, were so~at surprised at not exchanging fare-&#xD;
wells with the bold c~utlaw~ as he had promised them should be&#xD;
the case. They little anticipated for him, such a short and hur-&#xD;
ried transition, from the extreme health, hope and vigor of&#xD;
impetuous and eager manhood, to the stagnating and corrupting&#xD;
embrace of death; and did not learn, until they had arrived in&#xD;
Florida, the history of the bloody and fatal conflict which we&#xD;
have narrated. It was with a feeling of disappointment, that&#xD;
they turned their eyes upon the wide waste of waters before&#xD;
their prows, from the crowds upon the shore, gradually melting&#xD;
into masses, and to be indiPidualized no longer. As the night&#xD;
came on, Philip de Vasconselos threw himself upon the deck of&#xD;
the caramel, musing sadly upon the stars as they silently stole&#xD;
out to sight, and hardly knew that the boy Juan crouched as&#xD;
silently behind him. There was scarcely a word spoken be-&#xD;
tween them that night, yet, somehow, this silent attendance, and&#xD;
simple devotion of the page, strengthened, at each moment, the&#xD;
feeling of sympathy, with which the knight, from the very first,&#xD;
regarded him.&#xD;
"The boy hath a heart," quoth Philip to himself;.-" he can&#xD;
feel. He hath not yet survived his tenderness. But it will not be&#xD;
for long. The world rarely leaves us loi~g in possession of such&#xD;
a treasure. Were he wise, now, the sooner he flings it from him,&#xD;
or puts it to silence, the more sure were he to .escape its sor-&#xD;
rows. What profits it to us that we have the wealth that keeps&#xD;
us wakeful; when sleep,-sleep,-is the best blessing that we&#xD;

VASCONSELO~.&#xD;
&#xD;
*     mind and eye, capable of reading a very subtle, profound and mys.&#xD;
serious language. Now the secret of this capacity is to be found&#xD;
only in very active susceptibilities, on the part of him who reads.&#xD;
lli~ open sensibilities must be keen and watchful; he must&#xD;
possess a~gentle spirit at the core: he must have loved and&#xD;
suffered; must still love and suffer; must be full of .pity and&#xD;
sorrow, though he speaks little and doth not complain; and&#xD;
there must be a rare delicacy of sentiment in his soul, so that&#xD;
there shall be no change in the aspect of the other whom he seeks&#xD;
or esteem~, however slight, that he shall not see, and comprehend&#xD;
at a single glance. Nor wants he to see, except to be solicitous;&#xD;
nor comprehend that he may slight. It is enough, here to say,&#xD;
that these conditions, by which kindred spirits seek, meet, and&#xD;
link themselves with one another, were all found in the respect&#xD;
of Don Philip and the boy Juan; so that a look, a tone, a ges.&#xD;
ture, of one or the other, did not fail to make itself fully under.&#xD;
stood by both, and to command at the same time the most&#xD;
genial sympathy. And it shall be no long time, after such is&#xD;
found to be the case between two such parties, when it will be&#xD;
impossible to maintain cold barriers of society, keeping them&#xD;
separate; when the two hearts shall so yearn for the close com-&#xD;
munion, that the mind shall forget all the distinctions of men&#xD;
on land, and there shall be a gentle law controlling both, which&#xD;
shall do away utterly with all common usages of constraint,&#xD;
substituting others of a finer fabric, more subtle, apparent, and&#xD;
not less strong; which shall grow out of veneration and sympa-&#xD;
thy. Thus it was that Philip de V~sconselos soon' learned-&#xD;
even in that short voyage-to love the boy, Juan, as a boy of&#xD;
truly loyal and deyout soul; as of tender and sweet sympathies;&#xD;
and of tastes so delicate, as equally to confound the knight at&#xD;
their possession by one of his sex and race. The boy, on the&#xD;
other hand, might be supposed to love the knight because of his&#xD;
justice, his noble purpose and princely thoughts; his gr~at courage&#xD;
and skill in arm~; hi~s graceful carriage; and for all that was&#xD;
manly and great in his character. It might be that, had Philip&#xD;
been of the other sex, these traits would have proved less im-&#xD;
posing in the estimation of the page! But it matters little as to&#xD;
what were the causes, respectively working, by which the two&#xD;
gradually grew to be so well attached to each other. Enough,&#xD;
that such is the fact, and that they held frequent communion.&#xD;
With whom else should Philip commune? Never was noble&#xD;
knight more desolate of soul, and lone of place, than he. Often&#xD;
did the eyes of Philip rest searchingly upon the bronze features&#xD;
of the boy, with a curious and tender interest. It seemed to&#xD;

good duty in the thickest of the flght,-to rend or devour the&#xD;
naked savages, upon whom they had been. taught to feed. The&#xD;
chivalry of that day found nothing inhuman in the use of such an&#xD;
agency in war. But, as mere conquest ~were nothing without&#xD;
taking heed to its acquisitions, workmen, and the necessary atppa.&#xD;
ratus, were carried, for the purpose of smelting and~ refinixig the&#xD;
precious metals which they confidently expected to find. Nor&#xD;
were the chains, handcuffs, and collars of iron, forgotten, by which&#xD;
kheir captives were to be secured% in order to be shipped safely&#xD;
to the plantations of the Cuban. Droves of cattle, mules, and&#xD;
hoo's, constitu~d a more benevolent provision, made for the wants&#xD;
of the expedition, when it should reach the country, where the&#xD;
hogs and cattle were to be let go free.&#xD;
Accustomed to the easy conquest of such feeble tribes as the&#xD;
Peruvian, De Soto felt that such an armamei~t, so far surpassing&#xD;
those of Cortez and Pizarro, was quite equal to the conquest~ over&#xD;
the whole country of the Apalachian. Never a doubt of this&#xD;
result crossed the mind of the haughty Adelantado, and he made&#xD;
instant preparations for throwing a body of troops on shore, and&#xD;
taking possession of the territory in the name of his monarch,&#xD;
the Emperor, Charles the Fifth. The wealthy knight, Yasco&#xD;
Porcallos,.claimed the high honor of leading this party, and per-&#xD;
forming this act of sovereignty; and the privilege was conceded&#xD;
him. He was to have the command of a force of three thousand&#xD;
men, being, in fa~t, all those who could be prepared for disem-&#xD;
barkation during that day. The shipping, meanwhile, were gra~&#xD;
dually warping in shore, a performance not so easy on account of&#xD;
the rapid shoaling of the water, and for which they had to depend&#xD;
upon the tides. Meanwhile, more for the purposes of solemnity&#xD;
and state, than because he felt the need to be taught anything, the&#xD;
Adelantado' called a council of his chh~f officers. Philip do Vas-&#xD;
conselos was invited to this conference. He, by the way, had been&#xD;
one of those designated to land with Va~co Porcallos, the better&#xD;
that he might act as interpreter, should there be any meeting with&#xD;
the red men. With regard to this sort of service, De Soto now&#xD;
more than ever felt the importance or having one with him who&#xD;
not only had some knowledge of the country, but who could thus&#xD;
become a medium of communication with its people. Though&#xD;
still a little too lofty and reserved towards our knight of Portu-&#xD;
gal, he yet descended somewhat from his pride of place in order&#xD;
to solicit him. He had already distinguished him by the request,&#xD;
that he would serve about his person as one of his Lieutenants,-&#xD;
a request which the other had no motive to refuse; and he cheer-&#xD;
fully consented to disembark among the first with Vasco Por-&#xD;

&#xD;
knight of Portugal; and the latter, shrugging his shoulders, con.&#xD;
soled himself with the reflection, that the lesson which he strove&#xD;
in vain to enforce, would probably be taught, though at a greater&#xD;
cost to his hearers, by the Apalachian him'~elf.&#xD;
"The experience which tutors pride to a just humility," he&#xD;
mused within himself; "is perhaps, the best sort of lessening;&#xD;
and he who wQuld succeed, when the warfare is somewhat with&#xD;
his own vanity, cannot be sa'i~ed from the punishment which fol-&#xD;
lows close upon its indulgence. It is well, perhaps, that he will&#xD;
not hear, since it is only right that *he should be made to feel;&#xD;
and our safety and success, pc~rhaps, must equally depend upon&#xD;
our being made to feel, at the beginning of the adventure, rather&#xD;
than at a later time, when we are too deeply engaged in it. But,&#xD;
so sure ~as there are Fates, Hernando de Soto will be certain&#xD;
to receive ,his lesson before he hath gone very deeply into his&#xD;
books."&#xD;
The conference,-such as it was-where there could be no&#xD;
dissent and~ no deliberation,~-was soon at an end. De.. Soto&#xD;
simply detailed his plans at length, and gave his order for the&#xD;
disembarkation,, the conduct of which was entrusted to the&#xD;
wealthy Don Vasco Porcallos; and never was ambitious mortal&#xD;
more eager than he to set forth on his adventures. His ap-&#xD;
petites for gold and captives had been growing with every league&#xD;
of progress which he had made on the watery waste, and still&#xD;
less than the Adelantado was he prepared to apprehend the pos.&#xD;
sibiity of failure or reverse of any sort in his present frame of&#xD;
mind. He dreamed only of riding down myriads of jiaked and&#xD;
panic-stricken savages, selecting the most vigorous captives and.&#xD;
spearing the rest. But Vasconselos better knew the angere, and&#xD;
hence the duty. He knew they were not to triumph without&#xD;
hard fighting, great firmness, and constant 'caution.&#xD;
Scarcely had the vessels appeared in sight of the coasts, than&#xD;
the balefires smoked on all the heights and tumuli that lined the&#xD;
shore, attesting the watch and vigilance of the Floridians. These&#xD;
were signals of danger, and announced to the warriors in the inte-&#xD;
rior to gather from all quarters. Philip pointed out these sig.&#xD;
nals to the page. "See you, Juan," said he,-" already the red&#xD;
men have taken alarm. Those smokes that rise every where in&#xD;
sight, will kindle other smokes, which shall give warning to all&#xD;
the separate tril5es. They will fire piles throughout the mighty&#xD;
forests, until the answering smokes shall ascend from the great&#xD;
mountains of the Apalachian. Where a people are thus vigilant&#xD;
to note and prepare for the first dangers of invasion, they are&#xD;
wailike; they will fight famously ; ' they will give us work to&#xD;

VASCO~Sii~tOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"In God's name, boy., have your wish. You say rightly4.&#xD;
There must be a time, when this lesson must be taught, and&#xD;
learned, and the sooner, as you say, the better. Get on your&#xD;
escaupil, and see that your weapons are such as will serve to&#xD;
risk a life upon. Bring them hither, fhat I may see.~~&#xD;
We must not linger on these details. Suffice it that all parties&#xD;
were soon prepared for the landing. It was on the last day of&#xD;
the month of May, soft, serene and sweet, that the gallant Lii.&#xD;
dalgo, Don Vasco Porcallos, led the way for his detachment of&#xD;
three hundred, andi took final possession of the soil of the Flo-&#xD;
ridians in the name of Spain. The solemnity was a very stately&#xD;
one, but needs not that w~e describe it. The banner of Castile&#xD;
was unrolled and elevated in the free air of the Apalachians, and&#xD;
~ras planted upon one of the elevations nearest to the shore.&#xD;
The region was thickly wooded, the forests were all clad in the&#xD;
freshest verdure of the opening summer; the breeze was charged&#xD;
with odors from worlds of flowers, the choicest natives of the&#xD;
country; and a natural delight filled every bosom, and exhila-&#xD;
rated the spirits of tjne soldiery with an enthusiasm that seemed&#xD;
already in possession of the fullest successes. In pitching th4'eir&#xD;
can~p, Philip de Vasconselos again ventured to' give such hints&#xD;
to Don Vasco, as became his experience and caution. But the&#xD;
latter was even more sanguine than De Soto, and less heedful;&#xD;
and the manner in which he received these counsels of the knight&#xD;
of Portugal, seemed .to have been borrowed from that of the&#xD;
Adelantado on the occasion air~dy~ shown. He was civilly&#xD;
scornful, and Vasconselos saw, ~it~~i chagrin and apprehension,&#xD;
that the ground chosen for the ni~ht was such as would rather&#xD;
invite and facilitate than discourage from attack. But he could do&#xD;
no more. He had only to submit, and hope against his fears,&#xD;
and provide as well as he might, against the emergency that he&#xD;
anticipated; But lacking all command, with but the single fol-&#xD;
lower, he a child, inexperienced and evidently tired, what could&#xD;
be done ~&#xD;
"Come," said he cheerfully to Juan, "come, my boy, and let&#xD;
us seek out our quarters. We are limited to a certain precinct,&#xD;
but this~ affords .. choice of sleeping-place, and upon this choice&#xD;
may rest chance of safety."&#xD;
The boy followed in silence. The knight rambled over the&#xD;
ground assigned for the encampment, and chose a little dump of&#xD;
wood, which afforded sufficient cover for 'a small group, yet stood&#xD;
apart, as it were, from the rest of the forest: affording an inter-&#xD;
val, over which the eye could range with tolerable freedom for&#xD;
some sp~e, and thus note any hostile approaches. To find this par-&#xD;

VASCONSELOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
vcinient, they selected their own place of repose. The dried&#xD;
leiwes of the forest furnished a sufficient couch; the forest pines&#xD;
and other trees yielded a goodly shelter. The evening was calm&#xD;
and grateful. The warm serenity of the season required no&#xD;
closer lodgings. The most perfect repose prevailed throughout&#xD;
the forest, and save the clamor made by the troops, not a sound&#xD;
was t6 be heard, whetl~er on land or sea. The soldiers dis-&#xD;
persed themselves about the woods, chose their places of repose&#xD;
as Vasconselos had done, but without any regard to his precau.&#xD;
tions. They saw no danger, and apprehended none, as they be.&#xD;
held no foe, and all was confidence, and all was excitement.&#xD;
"Surely, Sei'ior," said Juan, "these quiet woods harbor no&#xD;
enemies.~~&#xD;
"It is in the quiet seas, Juan, that the shark prevails. In the&#xD;
tempest he retires- to his ocean caverns. The wolf prowls in the&#xD;
stillness of the night. The adder is a great traveller in the dark&#xD;
hours. It is because these forests are so quiet now, that I feel&#xD;
there are enemies at hand. But let us sup ere we speak of them,&#xD;
lest we forfeit something of appetite. Where is thy wallet ?"&#xD;
It was produced. The page displayed its contents, and stood&#xD;
in waiting.&#xD;
"Sit, boy, and eat with me. Thou art my companion, child,&#xD;
not slave. - Sit !"&#xD;
With a strange tremor in his limbs, and vacant look which&#xD;
did not escape the eye of Philip, the boy took his seat before&#xD;
him, but scarcely nigh. This emotion the knight ascribed to&#xD;
the humility of the page. He strove to soothe this b~y conde-&#xD;
scension, by the utmost gentleness of manner and fondness of&#xD;
discourse; but the effect was not ~uch as ~e expected-not just&#xD;
then, at least.&#xD;
"Time will weal' off these fears," said the knight to himself; as&#xD;
he broke the bread and passed it to the bo$~.&#xD;
"Eat, Juan!, Thou wilt need to learn ow to eat and sleep at&#xD;
all seasons; if thou would~ become a sol ier. We shall have&#xD;
to wake and fight, when it shall not please s, the ~ummons; and&#xD;
shall not be summoned to our food alwa s, or our sleep, when&#xD;
most the appetite shall call for both."&#xD;
When they had supped, Philip said-&#xD;
"Now, Juan, thou wilt watch while I sle p. I will take advan-&#xD;
tage of the early hours of the night, when the red man seldom&#xD;
prowls or strikes, and in the middle of it, I will .wake, or thou&#xD;
shalt waken me, that I may take thy place as watcher for the rest&#xD;

&#xD;
fancies, dreaming and delicious, yet so touched with a peculiar&#xD;
sadness, that the bitter predominated over the sweet, and the big&#xD;
tears might be seen, moulding themselves into melancholy jew.&#xD;
els in the starlight, rounding theitiselves gradually upon his cheek,&#xD;
and dropping one by one, as they grew to brilliant. The hours&#xD;
swam along with the stars, and the stars waned in their silent&#xD;
progress for the blessing of other eyes~ and the eyes of Juau&#xD;
drooped at last with the heaviness upon them. He strove to&#xD;
shake off the drowsiness which he felt; but there was something&#xD;
in that foreign atmosphere which could not' be withstood, and&#xD;
while he strove to range along the barrel of the cross-bow,&#xD;
(which he had taken up with some vag~i e notion that it would&#xD;
k'eep him wakeful,) over the intervals whii~h spread between him&#xD;
and the gloQmy shadows of the wood which he had been espe-&#xD;
cially enjoined to watch ;-it seemed to him as if the wood it-&#xD;
self 'were swimming, like waves of the sea, and as if the stars&#xD;
descended to the plain, only to ascend on e more; to and fro;&#xD;
upward and downward and onward, till all things appeared to&#xD;
mix and mingle in his sight. Then sudde ly, he started, with a&#xD;
strange confusion, as he fancied he heard t e voice of Don Philip.&#xD;
This, for a moment, aroused him; but cooking down, he saw&#xD;
Don Philip still sleeping; and, satisfied t see thus, he was con-&#xD;
scious of little more after this for some time, though he might&#xD;
have been just as watchful as before. B t very soon after this,&#xD;
Don Philip really awakened. He found t e boy fast asleep,'with&#xD;
his arm thrown over his neck. He gently ~unloosed it, and rose.&#xD;
~' Poor boy !"~aid the knight-" Thoi~ hast taken on thee a&#xD;
perilous labor, which thy slight figure will scarce endure. But&#xD;
sleep, and I will watch thee. I could wish thee stronger, for my&#xD;
sake, no less than thine; for verily, of all this host, I have now&#xD;
none but thee !" After a pause-.--" And there is that about the&#xD;
child which binds me to him; whichmake~me love him almost!'&#xD;
Wherefore? It is because I am alone! It is because the nature&#xD;
of the strong ~'nan requires a charge, a t~ust, a burden, so that&#xD;
his strength shall be healthfully~at exercis~; so that his muscles&#xD;
shall r~ot shrink, lacking due employment Well! I will pro-&#xD;
tect a~d help him so long as I can help an# thing, and then-but&#xD;
why k~ok into the vast vacancy of that da~k realm of the future,&#xD;
in whi~h no flower shall ever grow for me."&#xD;
He ~6se suddenly, as if startled~ se&#xD;
to his hide, and caught up the     ized his sword, buckled it&#xD;
cross-bow ofr the page. He stole&#xD;
forward a few paces, and seemed to listen then returned to his&#xD;

the Voice of a woman. It appeared also 4 proceed from the spot&#xD;
where Juan had been left sleeping. Heby this time, had ven-&#xD;
tured out again to the edge of the wood, and was looking' Over&#xD;
the intervening space towards the dark forests lying b yond.&#xD;
The cry alarmed him; though it bore iio resemblance to the&#xD;
usual whoop of Indian battle. It migl7lt be that som wild&#xD;
beast~had found his way to where the boy slept-the pauth r's cry&#xD;
is like that of a child or girl,-and, wi excited 'puls , and&#xD;
the blood rapidly coursing through his ye us, Philip darte back&#xD;
to the place where the boy was left. He reached the sp t just&#xD;
in time to discover two dark forms,-cl arly men,--wh were&#xD;
drawing Juan away to the thickets., H readily divin d the&#xD;
purpose in the action. Again a shriek: nd this time he knew&#xD;
it for the boy's; but so full of a feminine terror, that hi heart&#xD;
sickened as he thought of the strange simplicity and ign rance&#xD;
which had prompted one so feeble to venture upon an ent rprise&#xD;
so perilous. He thought and felt thus, even in that mom nt of&#xD;
alarm. He saw that the boy struggled, a~d he further sa v that&#xD;
the dusky forms, by whom he had been seized, were brand shing,&#xD;
each, a heavy mace above his head. T~~ere was no ti e fbr&#xD;
further thought, or for hesitation. To dart forward, and ith a&#xD;
single stroke of his keen sword, to smite down one of the assail-&#xD;
ants; to grasp the other by the throat ai~d tear him fro the&#xD;
boy, then, as he staggered back, to run hih2i through the body,&#xD;
-was the work of a few moments. The ~wo savages lay at his&#xD;
feet in the agonies of death. The boy staggered, gasping, t ards&#xD;
him, an hysterical sob only breaking from ~is lips. With stern&#xD;
voice, the knight said&#xD;
"Seize thy cross-bow, Juan, and collect thyself. Thi is no&#xD;
time for fears. The Apalachian is on us."&#xD;
To confirm his words, at that very instant, the wild y us of&#xD;
the savages rose up in all quarters of t~ie encampment. The&#xD;
Spaniards struggled out of sleep only to encounter their en mies.&#xD;
The sentinels had slept. Few were awak~. The surpri was&#xD;
complete.&#xD;
"Follow me," cried Philip to th~ boy, ~ud his stern a cents,&#xD;
by enforcing obedience, in some degree disarmed Juan f his&#xD;
terrors; at all events, he obeyed. He foil wed by instinct, cross-&#xD;
bow in 'hand, and was at the side of the knight as the latter&#xD;
leaped upon his steed.&#xD;
"Up with thee, behind me, boy-we ha e not a ~mome ."&#xD;
And the light form, assisted by the p0 erful arm of hilip,&#xD;
sprang at once upon the steed. The spur was instantly riven&#xD;
into the beast's sides, and he was made to go! The wild rush,&#xD;

shall only notice the generall route pursued b the expedition,&#xD;
through what regions, and dwell upon those e ents only, which&#xD;
concern the persons of the drama, with whom we have already&#xD;
traveller ~l through so many pages.&#xD;
The encounter with the red men of Apala~hia., which, as we&#xD;
have seen, took place almost on the very mol# ent of De Soto's&#xD;
landing in the country, was only the beginning of a long history&#xD;
of. conWcts. From tribe to tribe, from village to village, he&#xD;
pressed onward, only to encounter the fiercest foes, or the niost&#xD;
treacherous friends. But, at the very outset o~' his career, he re-&#xD;
covere~ a Spaniard, one Juan Ortizwho had l~een a follower of&#xD;
Patuphilo de Narvaez, and had become a capti'~e to the Apalach-&#xD;
lans. ~n a captivity of several years, he had acquiredd the lan-&#xD;
guage qf many of the tribes, and alx~ost lost l~is own. This ac-&#xD;
quisitio~i rendered De Soto somewhat independent of the services of&#xD;
Phulipde Vasconselos. The latter was ~oon ade aware of this&#xD;
consciousness of independence, on the part of t e Adelantado.&#xD;
Eager for the attainment of the great Qbjects of the expedition,&#xD;
the famous cities, and the golden treasure, w ich 'were believed&#xD;
to be locked up in the Apalachian mountains, Soto lost no time&#xD;
in unnecessary delays. Dispatching his large t vessels to Ha-&#xD;
vana with the view to cutting off all thought n the part of his&#xD;
followers, of returning home-in this policy, emulating Cortez,&#xD;
and other great leaders,-"Soto retained but a ingle caravel, and&#xD;
two brigantines, to keep possession of the sea coast and the bay&#xD;
where he had cast anchor. To this charge, h appointed Pedro&#xD;
Calderon, an old soldier. He next proceeded o send f9rth vari-&#xD;

curious and exciting adventures; but tl~ey do not affect&#xD;

we lose our famous millionaire, Don Vasco Porcallos, w]&#xD;
adventure in a swanip, in which he narro~rly escaped sum&#xD;
cured effectually of all his warlike ambition, and who r&#xD;
with ~he fleet to Cuba.&#xD;
Soto set forth himself; after no great delay, for the ii&#xD;
His splendid cavalry were free for use, by the employer&#xD;
    hordes of captive Indians who carried the heavy luggage&#xD;
expedition. His foot marched at an easy rate, the caval~&#xD;
*   curing supplies, and clearing the forests ~s they went.&#xD;
way, the army marched from Tampa to A~aica near the ii&#xD;
Tallahassee. The brigantines, meanwhile, coasting the sho&#xD;
covered the harbor of Ochoa, now Pensacola. Moving&#xD;
Anaica, Soto marched east, and successj~rely crossed the~&#xD;
Ockmulge, Oconee and Ogechee. He finally reached ti&#xD;
vannah. These marches were not made in peace. War ai&#xD;
ror hung upon the footsteps of the Spaniards. Every whei~&#xD;
met with foes ;-~-not such foes as the feeble Cuban or Peru'&#xD;
but fierce, stern, strong, implacable enemies,- accustom&#xD;
hard blows, and to a life of incessant warfare. The ~idvai&#xD;
lay with the Spaniards, but only as a consequence of their&#xD;
nor civilization. They owed their victories to their cavali&#xD;
firearms, rather than their valor. In this quality, the Ap~&#xD;
ans were equal to any people that ever lived. The Spa~&#xD;
proved merciless conquerors. They mutilated where th&#xD;
not destroy, or desire to make captive. They had brought&#xD;
them handcuffs of iron for securing their prisoners, and&#xD;
ironed, the miserable wretchess bore the baggage. of theIr c~&#xD;
through the wilderness. Their conquest was not easily&#xD;
Thousands of the red men perished in the conflict, and the&#xD;
iards did not always escape. It was not easy to ride down&#xD;
fierce savages. Many of the whites perished. De Soto, hi~&#xD;
had several narrow escapes in close personal conflict, in whici&#xD;
for his companions in arms, he must have been slain. We&#xD;
not say that, on all these occasions, Philip de Vasconselos&#xD;
tamed himself according to his reputation. He suffered n&#xD;
aster. His page was equally fortunate. The latter had ri~&#xD;
his master's esteem, as he had subsequently shown more co&#xD;
than had been promised by his first encounter, at the landi~&#xD;

satisfy the spectators-if any may~ be thought to have been spec-&#xD;
tators at such a time, and in such fields-of h~s stoutness of&#xD;
heart a~id readiness of aim. Philip de Vasconselos himself was&#xD;
satisfied, and felt ~nore at ease in respect to the boy's safety, than&#xD;
he had been at the first opening of the campaign.&#xD;
He ~yas more than satisfied in other respects. The boy proved&#xD;
an intelligent companion. In his society the knight found solace,&#xD;
and oft~n did he fuel surprise, at the equal taste and intellect, so&#xD;
different from his race, which, as they grew more and more inti-&#xD;
mate, t~ie boy betrayed. Of course, Philip had not forgotten&#xD;
what Mateo had told him, that Juan, the son of a free woman of&#xD;
the mo~intain5, had been carefully nurtured, and had not been&#xD;
wanting in such education as could be procured by money, in&#xD;
such a region, during that early period. But the intellect of the&#xD;
boy declared for gifts; quite as much as acquisition-such gifts&#xD;
as were not often found in any other than the white race. But,&#xD;
though such exhibitions surprised Philip, quite as much as they&#xD;
delighted him, yet his moods and present employment were not&#xD;
of a sott to suffer him much speculation upon them. - lie was,&#xD;
after a ~vhile, quite content to enjoy their benefits, in the solace&#xD;
4iich they brought, without questioning their source; and he&#xD;
needed all this solace. He was still alone, and still, in spite of&#xD;
his services and valor, quite as much as before an object of jea-&#xD;
lousy among the Spaniard~ Nuno de Tobar, indeed, was still&#xD;
his friend, and he knew others in the army, who were kindlily&#xD;
inclined; but it was not often that the parties saw each other.&#xD;
They were in different commands, and frequently detached on&#xD;
expediti6ns, aside from the main route. There had been* no&#xD;
absolute reconciliation between the Portuguese brothers; and&#xD;
Andrea still kept aloof; though we may state that his bitterness&#xD;
of mood had been modified. But they rarely met. Philip was&#xD;
* a frequent volunteer when perilous or adventurous service was&#xD;
required. It was in this way, mostly, that he exercised his skill&#xD;
in arms, save when summoned to the special assistance of the&#xD;
Adelantado, to whom he was nominally an aide; but this rarely&#xD;
happened except when captives or embassies were to be examin-&#xD;
ed, and interpretations made from their language. This requi-&#xD;
sition, too, had been of infrequent occurrence since Juan Ortiz&#xD;
had been recovered. He, however, sometimes failed to under-&#xD;
stand the tono~ues of foreign tribes, and thus it was that Philip&#xD;
was needed. ~But for this, his uses in the ar~ny, according to the&#xD;
estimates seemingly put upon them by his superior, were of little&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
Philip felt this treatment, and his boy showed that he felt it&#xD;

also. The two lived to themselves apart. They lay bcn4&#xD;
same trees at night: they harnessed their horses in th&#xD;
glade. They sat together at the same repast; Juan ret:&#xD;
hind his lord, and speaking with him thus; except when, a&#xD;
as finally was frequently the case, Philip bade him to sil&#xD;
him, or before him-a proceeding which the knight adop'&#xD;
better to encourage the boy, arid tQ overcome his excess&#xD;
ness. And he gradually succeedect The boy, who shrar&#xD;
all other associations, gractually grew to him, as the vine&#xD;
to the mighty tree. Soon he came to speak freely ever&#xD;
own secret fancies and emotions, and it really pleased the&#xD;
to hearken the language, still timidly spoken, of a young&#xD;
lug heart, possessed of the deepest and tenderest feelings&#xD;
the isolation in which he lived, and the wild seclusion&#xD;
realm of shade arid forest, seemed rather to expand an~&#xD;
bk, than subdue and overcome. The deep solitude wI&#xD;
ceived them as they went, seemed to open the Warmer foi&#xD;
of their human nature, as society rarely opens them. 3&#xD;
together -ineessantly~forced to communion by the re~&#xD;
treatment of the rest-sleeph~g near each other by ni~&#xD;
countering the same toils ahd dangers by' day,.-breaki&#xD;
saffle loaf when they ate, and, naturally inclined to each ot&#xD;
kindred sensibilities,-it was soon evident to each that the&#xD;
of their lives lay chiefly in the regards of erie another.&#xD;
was a sad simplicity in both their natures,-a grave tend&#xD;
-of soul, which still further helped to cement their intimacy&#xD;
it was soon felt-by Philip, at least,-that, in this ne&#xD;
seemingly incongruous relationship, the peculiar pangs ai:&#xD;
appointments which he had experienced in Cuba, were fast&#xD;
the sharpness arid severity of their sting. He sometime:&#xD;
dered at himself that he so much craved the companions&#xD;
the boy; but he was too much~ pleased with the enjoyment&#xD;
to question its sources. When they were apart he muse&#xD;
his fondness: with curiosity. Why should he, a knight of&#xD;
gal, feel such sympathy for this Moorish urchin? It was&#xD;
that he recalled the boy's devotion to himself.-his goodn&#xD;
heart, his gentleness of mood, the quickness of his mm&#xD;
delicacy of his fancy, and his general intelligence. These d&#xD;
suffice to account for the hold upon his affections which tli&#xD;
had taken. In all his meditations when leff to himself he&#xD;
no solution of his problem. When the boy was at haric&#xD;
they spoke together, there was no problem. It seemed t&#xD;
quite natural, at such moments, all the affection that he I&#xD;
all the sympathy that warmed him to the dusky page.&#xD;

SUSPICION.                   895&#xD;
To all ot ers, Juan was a stone,-inse~sible, unattractive-a&#xD;
sullen, reser ed arid silent boy,-submissive, but retiring; hum-&#xD;
ble, but not soliciting; one of whom nobody entertained thought&#xD;
or question; of whom the common speech in camp was, that this&#xD;
page was just suited to the haughty and sullen master. There&#xD;
was an exception perhaps to this general judgment. D.~al-&#xD;
thazar de Alvaro was observed to note the boy with a persevering&#xD;
eye. Juan was the first to be aware of this. It did not finally&#xD;
escape the notice of Philip; but it did riot occasion his surprise&#xD;
or curiosity. In the case of Juan, however, it was something&#xD;
of an annoy~rice. Had he been watched, it would have been&#xD;
seen that he ~otight to avoid the eyes of Don Balthazar-that he&#xD;
was somewhat agitated when they met suddenly-that he spoke&#xD;
with a slight tremor of voice in the' hearing of the Don, and es-&#xD;
pecially when, as was sometimes the case, he was required to&#xD;
answer his demands. It sometimes happened that Don Baltha..&#xD;
zar sought V4sconselos at his post, or where h~ had cast himself&#xD;
down for the night. On such occasions-as he considered the&#xD;
ostensible si~bject upon which the former came,-he could riot&#xD;
forbear musiiig upon its ii.~madeqi~iacy as a plea for coming. The&#xD;
parties did riot love each othc~r. Their instincts wei~e hostile.&#xD;
There could riot be any cordialit~y between them; and, such b~ing&#xD;
the case, wh~ Don Baithazar shoiz ld seek him, unless with reasons&#xD;
of necessit~~was a frequent subject..~of Philip's surprise. At .such&#xD;
times, he alWays drew an unfavorable augury from hi~ coming.&#xD;
"He meaki s mischief~" said he aloud, one evening, after the&#xD;
departure of Don Balthazar from the place where he had laid&#xD;
himself dow~ to rest. "Why should he come to me, and on&#xD;
such pretext? What is it to me whither we move to-morrow,&#xD;
or what new dreams fill the brain of the Adelantado? ~et him&#xD;
march, east or west, along the plains, or among the mountains,&#xD;
I care nothing! and, sure, he knows it. He knows, to ~, that I&#xD;
love not his serpent nature, and his subtle and treacherous eye.&#xD;
He knows, t~o; that Lam riot to be deceived in him! besidess,&#xD;
what can he~ seek of me? I am poor arid powerless. ~ELe can&#xD;
win nothing rrom my weakness~ If he comes, he can only come&#xD;
in hate! Yell what have Ito fear? Him I fear not, and he knows&#xD;
it too. Yer4y I believe, that did he riot fear me, he would have&#xD;
sought to s~ay me ere this, -nevertheless--I feel it-by sure&#xD;
instinct, I feel it-this man means mischief."&#xD;
"He is a ~rillain !" was the bitter speech of Juan from behind&#xD;
the tree, wh4re he ha~1 crept quietly.&#xD;
"Hat Ju ri are you there, boy? But what do you know&#xD;
about Don l~althazar? Ah! Juan, if you knew what I know of&#xD;

that man-had you but seen what mine eyes have look~&#xD;
"Seen, Senor ?-" was the faltered inquiry.&#xD;
"Aye,~boy, seen! But it is not for you t~o hear-not for&#xD;

Vasconselos was asleep. The boy had e~ten no supper. He c&#xD;
close by his sleeping master, and wat4~hed over him for w~&#xD;
hours, with big tears gathering fast in his eyes the while.&#xD;

"Hell put it in&#xD;
The enemy's iriind to be desperate."  MAsSJ ~GsR.&#xD;
WE can nly give glimpses of a progress, every form of&#xD;
which was di tinguished by its own interest and capricious varie-&#xD;
ties. We ha e shown, thus far, the relationships of our parties;&#xD;
and how the grew, and what were their developments. Each&#xD;
day gradually contributed to unfold the increasing dependence of&#xD;
Don Philip nd his page upon one another; and both were&#xD;
watched, tho gh neither perhaps saw to what extent, by the ser-&#xD;
pent eyes of on Balthazar de Alvaro. Meanwhile, Philip de&#xD;
Vasconselos eemed to grow less and less in favor with the Ade-&#xD;
lantado, who now rarely summoned him to his service; and,&#xD;
except when. they met, seemed to have forgotten his existence.&#xD;
On such occasions there was an evident distance of manner in&#xD;
the bearing o~ D~ S6to, amounting~almost to. repugnance, which&#xD;
increased the regrets of Philip that he had ever joined th~ expe-&#xD;
dition. His mortification at having done so, would have been&#xD;
unendurable but for a certain indifference of mood, which ren-&#xD;
dered him reckless what became of him,-reckless of all things,&#xD;
indeed; and ~nade him just as well satisfied to rove without a&#xD;
purpose, and fight without a cause, as to sleep beneath h~s tree,&#xD;
when the day had closed in exhaustion. Latterly, his feeling&#xD;
grew less different. He seemed to be slowly acquiring a new&#xD;
interest in li~'e. He was conscious of more impulse, c~f aim,&#xD;
and objects, yague, indeed, enough, and which he did not peek to&#xD;
pursue, but which served to show, that life for him still ~ad its&#xD;
resources, even its attractions, and was not wholly der~ied an&#xD;
object. But ~f the question as to that object was asked 9f Don&#xD;
Philip, he wo&amp;amp;ild have been without an answer. Enough that&#xD;
under existing~ circumstances, he could find his associations still&#xD;
endui'able ;-without an~object in life, he could yet find life not.&#xD;
wholly a burden and a curse!&#xD;
The brooding mind was not suffered much opportunity for ex-&#xD;
ercise, in the progress pursued by De Soto. That ambitious chief-&#xD;
tain, in his appetite for conquest and power, kept his followers&#xD;
sleepless. We may now, with tolerable certainty, follow the&#xD;
route of the ~paniards upon the map, and trace their course from&#xD;

the Bay of Tampa, into and through Georgia, even to&#xD;

strange episodes, which diverted them from the true disco 4&#xD;
In all their progresses danger hung upon them in the rear&#xD;
disappointment stood in waiting for their approach. One or&#xD;
adventures briefly narrated, will serve to illustrate their&#xD;
history; and we linger over a single instance, which en&#xD;
Yasconselos tc recover a portion of De Soto's favor.&#xD;
There was a Floridian Chieftain, or King, named Vitae&#xD;
who had stubbornly resisted all the approaches of Soto.&#xD;
latter, by treachery, contrived to secure the person of this C&#xD;
tam. His next object was to win his favor-a measure conce&#xD;
to be by no means difficult, inasmuch as the Adelanted&#xD;
making captive the Chief; had slaughtered near a thousand o&#xD;
warriors, who had sought to rescue his person. Vitachuco, th&#xD;
kept as a prisoner, and watched, was still allowed certain p&#xD;
leges. He ate at the table of Soto. He was still able to c&#xD;
mune with his subjects, hundreds of whom were employed a&#xD;
the Spaniards, as slaves and drudges. To these Vitachuco c&#xD;
municated his secret thoughts and purposes. He was n&#xD;
willing captive. But he was politic. He met subtlety ~&#xD;
subtlety. He suppressed his indignation,-appeared not to&#xD;
the restraint put upon his footsteps, and so behaved, as enti&#xD;
to disarm the suspicions of his captors. But the fiery mdi&#xD;
tion was working in his soul, and he only wanted the pro&#xD;
moment and opportunity, in which to break his bonds,&#xD;
avenge himself upon his captors. This design was reserved&#xD;
a day of feasting, when Soto entertained his captive along&#xD;
other nobles and princes of the Apalachians, held in sim&#xD;
bonds with their superior, or of other tribes whom he desired&#xD;
conciliat~,. Vitachuco was too impatient of his injuries to th&#xD;
wisely, or to resolve with prudence. He did not heed the I&#xD;
that himself and followers were unarmed, and were t grap}&#xD;
if grapple they did, with foes who never laid aside thei weap~&#xD;
or their mail. The fearless savage resolved to try th st~'ug&#xD;
at all odds, unprepared as he was, at the approaching epast;&#xD;
which he.had due intimations. The four pages or ser , t&#xD;
waited upon him, ~were all boys, but he entrusted the, with&#xD;
secret. They communicated with such warriors as e hims&#xD;

TREACHERY.                     p399&#xD;
According to their, plan, Vitachuco was to spring upon the Ade-&#xD;
lantado, and kill him if he could, while they were at dinner; his&#xD;
followers doing the same good service for all the Spaniards pre-&#xD;
sent-and, without, for all others upon whom, they cot4d lay&#xD;
hands. The village of Vitachuco was to be the scene of action.&#xD;
lt happened, the evening before the event, that Juan, the page&#xD;
of Vasconselos, remarked the activity of Vitachuco's pages, and&#xD;
that they held frequent communications with their people.&#xD;
Crowds of the red men were seen i coming to the encampment,&#xD;
or crowding stealthily about it. he place where Vascoiiselos&#xD;
found shelter, usually, on the verge of the encampment, was fa-&#xD;
vorable to observation; and the co stant coming and departure&#xD;
of the Floridians, compelled the bo 's observation, and prompted&#xD;
him to communicate with the kni ht, his master. They both&#xD;
watched, and discovered enough, a all events, to render them&#xD;
suspicious. They redoubled their vigilance, and found that some&#xD;
provisions, ra~her~ novel for a feast, had been made by the sava-&#xD;
ges. They found hidden in the coi tiguous woods, large bundles&#xD;
of darts, barbed with flints, that we e ready for use; and scores&#xD;
of huge macanas or war maces, edged with flint also, a single&#xD;
blow from which, in a moderately strong hand, would cleave the&#xD;
skull of any Spaniard, though covered with helm of steel.&#xD;
To effect these discoveries, and to guard in some degree against&#xD;
the designs of the savages, by putting the army on the qui ~vi~e,&#xD;
was a work of time, and the Adelantado was ahead at dinner&#xD;
with his treacherous guests, ore Philip do Vasconselos' was pre-&#xD;
pared to unfold his discoveries. Now,-speaking of things&#xD;
without regard to persons-the Spaniards were quite as treacher-&#xD;
ous as the Floridians; and it was with a bitter smile and sneer&#xD;
that Philip, commenting upon the small claims of the f~prmer&#xD;
upon his fidelity, said to Juan&#xD;
"It is liar against liar, serpent against serpent I-what have&#xD;
we to do with it, boy ~? It were just as well that we should see&#xD;
them strive together, and clap hands equally to behold thq good&#xD;
stroke delivered by Floridian or Spaniard I"&#xD;
But the sympathies of race and education prevailed, and the&#xD;
white chieftain, with a feeling of unutterable scorn, which he con-&#xD;
cealed under the most courtly demeanor, suddenly appeai~'ed at&#xD;
the place of feasting,-to which he had not been invited,~-J-when&#xD;
all was most hilarious, and the Adelantado as little dreaming of&#xD;
the dessert which the Floridian had provided, as of any other&#xD;
good blessing, with which he might profitably dispense. Vas-&#xD;
conselos, as we say, suddenly appeared within the circle, and for&#xD;
a moment, quietly surveyed it 'without speaking.&#xD;

itself in his features, or that the Adelantado was in&#xD;
behold him with toleration, whom he had not recei~&#xD;
is not easy to be said. It is certain, however, that&#xD;
what forgot his courtesy in the reception which I&#xD;
knight~of Portugal. With a stern look and chilling&#xD;
cried out, as he beheld him&#xD;
"how now, Sir Knight of Portugal, what is it bi&#xD;
this presence at this unseemly moment? We had n&#xD;
ed the honor of your attendance.&#xD;
The brow of the knight of Portugal grew black a&#xD;
"Senor Don Hernan de Soto, Philip de Vasconse&#xD;
favor or courtesy from any man alive! He comes&#xD;
courtier, or as a guest, but as a soldier, who shrinks f&#xD;
even when it needs that he should appear where he i&#xD;
come! What I have to say, by way of apology for&#xD;
ow, is soon spoken. Ask of the savages whom yo&#xD;
ur camp is girdled by a thousand red warriors, wh&#xD;
f their prince have been in such frequent communion&#xD;

Saying these words, he took from an attendant&#xD;
own upon the board, and amidst the guests, bund]&#xD;
apt in skins of the rattle-snake, and a score ol&#xD;
acanas, such as we have described already. At t&#xD;
hese objects, and before the Adelantado could reply&#xD;
conceived the insolent speech of Vasconselos-insole&#xD;
in tone-the war-whoop rang wildly through the&#xD;
rible yell that shook the hearts of the assembly, as wi&#xD;
voice of doom. Vitachuco, from whom the signal cs&#xD;
to his feet at the same moment, and, in the twinkling~&#xD;
he sprang, like a tiger, full upon Soto. With or&#xD;
seized him by the collar, while, with the dther, he de&#xD;
a blow between the eyes, as made the blood fly, an&#xD;
the Adelantado to the floor, as heavily as falls the ox&#xD;
stroke of the butcher!&#xD;
All wa~ confusion in that moment. Terribly d&#xD;
whoop of the savages ring throughout the hall ;-an&#xD;
through. all the avenues of the village, where the&#xD;
Vitachuco were collecting at the signal, as had bee&#xD;
among them. The Spaniards, never dreaming of att&#xD;
armed savages, were taken completely by surprise.&#xD;

out. The Indians, Everywhere, seized whatever implements they&#xD;
could lay hands upon for weapons. Some grasped the pikes and&#xD;
swords of the Spaniards; others snatched the pots from the fire,&#xD;
and emptied the contents over their foes, while beating them&#xD;
about the head with the vessels. Plates, pitchers, jars, the pes-&#xD;
tles from the mortars wherein they pounded. maize; stools~&#xD;
benches, tables, billets of wood; in the hands of the fierce Flo-&#xD;
ridians became instruments of war and vengeance! Never had&#xD;
such a fight been-seen; so promiscuous; urged with such novel&#xD;
weapons; and so full of terrQr and confusion. The terror and&#xD;
danger of the scene were duly increased by others yet, who,&#xD;
plucking the flaming brands of ligktwood from the fire, darted&#xD;
into the thickest of the fray, shouting like furies, and looking&#xD;
more like demons from the i~7Ifernal regions than mere mortal&#xD;
combatants!&#xD;
Such was the scene and the character of the struggle through-&#xD;
out the village. The Spaniards recovered themselves promptly&#xD;
an&amp;amp; fought desperately, and conquered finally; but they suffered&#xD;
severely. Besides those who perished, many were terribly&#xD;
bruised, scalded, burnt, and maimed. Arms were broken, teeth&#xD;
knocked out, faces scarred for ever; the very handcuffs on the&#xD;
wrists of many of the savages, becoming fearful means of in-&#xD;
jury and assault in the promiscuous and close struggle, hand to&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
ln the hall of the great house of the village where the Ade-&#xD;
lantado had feasted the ~Dassique, the conflict, though involving&#xD;
smaller numbers, was no less fearful and savage in its character.&#xD;
But for the presence of Philip de Vasconselos, and his active&#xD;
energies and vigilance, Soto, and all the party, must have pe-&#xD;
rished. The Adelantado, as we have seen, was stunned by the&#xD;
first desperate assault of the Indian Chief. The latter clung to&#xD;
his victim, and would very soon have finished his work, but for&#xD;
the quick movement of Philip, who darted to the rescue, and&#xD;
passed his sword through the body of the savage, while, tiger-like,&#xD;
he was tearing the neck of the Adelantado. The Spanish knights,&#xD;
at this sight, recovered from their consternation, and a dozen&#xD;
swords were crossed in an instant in the body of Vitachuco.&#xD;
The furious savage died without a groan, glaring, with fellest rage,&#xD;
upon his enemies, in the very ~omcnt when his last breath was&#xD;
passing. The Indians who remained in the hall were dispatched&#xD;
in like manner, but not before ~hey had inflicted hurts upon the&#xD;
Spaniards which left their ghastly marks through life. The end&#xD;
was massacre. Discipline prevailed over rude and ferocious&#xD;
valor. The people of Yitachu~o, thirteen hundred warriors, the&#xD;

Tuis event had a considerable effect in restoring Vascon&#xD;
to the favor of De Soto. The Adelantado could not ungrac&#xD;
ly forbear to acknowledge a service to which he owed his&#xD;
life and probably the safety of his army. He, ~ccordi:&#xD;
thanked Philip in stately language, hidalgo-~ashion, in the&#xD;
ence of all his troops. But his pride kepthim still in mer&#xD;
of that haughty reserve of the Portuguese cavalier, which h~&#xD;
offended his anwur propre at first; and as Philip, while as cc&#xD;
ously receiving the compliment of the Adelantado, in a styl&#xD;
dissimilar from that in which it was couched, abated nothing&#xD;
his own dignity, it followed, that the debt which De Soto&#xD;
of gratitude, was rather irksome and burdensome, than gr~&#xD;
to that haughty cavalier. He had, besides, ever at hand,&#xD;
pering insidious suggestions in his ear, the wily Don Balti&#xD;
do Alvaro. This knight did not suffer the natural feelings c&#xD;
Soto to have full play at any time, in his relations to the P&#xD;
guese. But for his constant labors, it might have been that&#xD;
was naturally noble in the bosom of the Adelantado, would&#xD;
asserted itself lo the extent of doing full justice to the men&#xD;
Philip; and giving full exercise to his own proper courtesy&#xD;
honor. As it was, the intercourse between the knight of P&#xD;
gal and the Spanish Chief, though more, courteous and gra&#xD;
than before, was. scarcely more cordial; and Philip remains&#xD;
before, companioned only by the page Juan, who clung to&#xD;
more closely than ever, and grew daily more and more nece~&#xD;
to his affections.&#xD;
We pass now over a considerable tract of time, of whic&#xD;
shall make no record, but which, though full of toils and st&#xD;
trials and vicissitudes, found our drarnatis personc~ unchang&#xD;

with the performance of his duty, as it rose, witho&#xD;

With the Cassique of Cofa, he concluded an air&#xD;
which secured the support and friendship of a veryj&#xD;
From hirn~owever, it was learned that there were&#xD;
ful potentates, yet beyond them, to the easb whon&#xD;
more necessary to conciliate. Much was said of&#xD;
Queen of Cofachiqui,-a province just beyond; ti&#xD;
of which was. very numerous, and the territory ye&#xD;
was reported to be very rich, also, in gold, pearls, a&#xD;
cious treasures. The young Princess who ruled th4&#xD;

beyond description, and the imagination of the Ac&#xD;
greatly inflamed by what he heard, of the surpass&#xD;
the maiden, her vast empire, her great treasures, a&#xD;
and power of her connections.. Her blood mingle5&#xD;
the great Chieftains and Princes who ruled along 1&#xD;
Chatahoochie, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Cass&#xD;
very powerful as he himself claimed to be, yet ackr&#xD;
inferiority to this Princess; his incapacity to encouni&#xD;
in war, and the fear which he felt of provoking&#xD;

add that, with savage cunning and ferocity, he con&#xD;
the sheltering wing of the Spaniards, to execute no 1&#xD;
upon the people and country of the power which h&#xD;
dreaded; butchering without remorse, and plunder&#xD;
he had the opportunity of doing so in secret. For I&#xD;

that the Adelantado, with a select detachment of a hundred&#xD;
cavalry, and as many infantry, emerged from the great fo~'ests,&#xD;
with the view to the passage of the stream. The noble river lay&#xD;
broad before him in the cloudless light of a noon-day sun. On&#xD;
the depressed position which he occupied, an esplanade of sw~imp,&#xD;
liable to occasional overflow of the freshets from the rapid rising&#xD;
of the waters, he looked up to the high banks on the opposite shore&#xD;
-now of Carolina-and surveyed a prospect before him wit~i un-&#xD;
qualified admiration. The mighty forest ranges had been scarcely&#xD;
broken in any quarter; and the gigantic oak, the hickory, the inub&#xD;
berry, and black walnut, stood up, and spread away in mighty&#xD;
ranks, solemnizing the scene as far as the eye could reach. Ter~&#xD;
minating long vistas, rose the rustic cots and cabins of the people&#xD;
of Cofachiqui, stretching in a half circle, which followed the course&#xD;
of the stream, and sufficiently nigh to enable the inhabitants to&#xD;
take their fish from its waters, without inconvenience, to their&#xD;
homes. Conical mounts, and terraces, artificial areas, consecrated&#xD;
to religious rites, or public sports and gatherings, relieved, with&#xD;
the villages, the monotony of the unbroken forest. Upon a bold&#xD;
promontory to the right, surrounded by trees of the greatest age,&#xD;
and most remarkable aspect, rose up the temple of the tribe:&#xD;
a rude but pictui'esque edifice of logs, encircled with pillars,&#xD;
around which the wild vine had been trained to run. So that the&#xD;
whole fabric, relieved of all rudeness to the eye, seemed to be'the&#xD;
handiwork of the endowing Spring herself; a green and purple&#xD;
trophy, vines, flowers and fruit, worthy tq be the scene of ~nno-&#xD;
cent rites, and the religion of a pure and simple-hearted pe~ple.&#xD;
It was surrounded by tumuli-by the graves of ages, overgrown&#xD;
b like manner with shrubs and vines. In the recesses o~' the&#xD;
temple, were other treasures of nature and trophies of art.&#xD;
There, subsequently, the Adelantado gathered heaps of pearl-&#xD;
bushels of treasure to the Spaniards ;-and there also were found&#xD;
some melancholy memorials of their own and other Eurojean&#xD;
l)eople. Shields, and helmets, and daggers, and spear-h~ads,&#xD;
cast away by the followers of Cabeza de Vaca, or more probably&#xD;
by those of the cruel and luckless Vasquez de Ayllen, at the&#xD;
mouth of the Combahee, which, according to Indian computation,&#xD;
was but two days' journey from Silver Bluff. But we must not&#xD;
anticipate.&#xD;
When the brilliant cavalcade of the Spanish Ch\ieftain arrived&#xD;
at the west bank of the Savannah, he found the ~pposite shore&#xD;
'covered with groups of the red men, looking out and watching&#xD;
his approach. The sighs of vigilance and confident strength&#xD;
were everywhere present to his cycs. The boats were numerous&#xD;

along the bai~ks, but they were all on the eastern si e of th r ver.&#xD;
Bands of warriors might be seen hastily arraying these s in&#xD;
their rude armor, and hurrying,-each as he mad himself r ady&#xD;
-with javelin, and spear, and bow, to join the c owds t a ga-&#xD;
thered by the river. Conspicuous among those u on the uks,&#xD;
were to be noticed a group of six persons, of very noble ( ear-&#xD;
ance, all of whom had ~passed the middle pen d of hf. To&#xD;
th~se, great deference was shown, and soon a gr ~t cano , pro-&#xD;
pelled by several strong rowers, approached the s ot wher they&#xD;
stood. They entered the canoe in silence, and, a omen a~er,&#xD;
it shot across the stream to the spot where De Sot had a ri~red,&#xD;
at the head oC his array. The fearless chieftains of the forest&#xD;
approached him with a calm dignity, and a nobi grace, jhich&#xD;
struck the Adelantado with surprise, and compel d his r s~ect&#xD;
He soon perceived that he stood in the presence of peopl , ~~rery&#xD;
far superior to those whom he had hitherto enco entered n the&#xD;
forests of the Floridian-superior in grace and art, f not in~ ~lor.&#xD;
De Soto hastily seated himself in a chair of state, w ich he rried&#xD;
with him for occasions ~like the present. The deput tion of l~iiefs&#xD;
made three references as they drew nigh,-one to the a~t, a&#xD;
second t~ the west, and a third to the Spanish Chi ftain. hen,&#xD;
they spoke through one of their party, a lofty and enerabi i~an,&#xD;
whose brow and hearing declared for habitual aut rity, a d the&#xD;
consciousness of power. He demanded briefly-&#xD;
"Wherefore do you come, stranger ~ Is it for eace or r&#xD;
Philip de Vasconsolos interpreted, and reported he ans~w e for&#xD;
the Adelantado in the language of Cofachiqui.&#xD;
"For Peace! we are friends. We ask only for a free p s ag~&#xD;
through the lands of your people, and their help, with rat and&#xD;
43anoe, in crossing your big rivers. We will pay r these elps&#xD;
in goods of our country."&#xD;
A long and pacific conference~ followed. The red en we e too&#xD;
well assured of their own pqwer to dread the s all an of&#xD;
strangers before them. They knew not of the fe rful w ons&#xD;
which they bore, and the powerful arts which t ey poss sed.&#xD;
At the close of the conference, the Chief of the eputati n re-&#xD;
peating his friendly assurances, said that he mu recei e the&#xD;
commands of Co~alla, the young Queen, his mistr ss. S was&#xD;
young- had but lately assumed dominion over t em, an hey&#xD;
were required to consult deliberately before the peril her&#xD;
authority, or the peace of the country, by any a tion o t ~eir&#xD;
own. But he did not doubt, that, from the gene ous nat re of&#xD;
this princess, she would do all in her power to pr mote t e ob-&#xD;
jects of the strangers.&#xD;

THE PI~INCESS COCALLA.         407&#xD;
&#xD;
They did not err in this conjecture. Perhaps, their own report&#xD;
prompted her compliance, or, at all events, provoked her curi-&#xD;
osity. It was nQt long after their return to the settlements, when&#xD;
the attention of the Spaniards was drawn to shows of great bus-&#xD;
tle and preparation along the opposite shore. The crowd con-&#xD;
tinued to gather. There were sounds of conchs and the oc-&#xD;
casional clamor of rattle and drum, regularly timed, and s~gnifi-&#xD;
cant of a gathering and a march. While the Spaniards ~azcd,&#xD;
~curious and anxious, a procession was beheld emerging from the&#xD;
woods, in the midst of which, seated upon a sort of palar~quin,&#xD;
and borne upon the shoulders of six able men, was the form of&#xD;
a young maiden; who was readily conceived to be the Princess&#xD;
of the country. The palanquin was wreathed with vines and&#xD;
flowers, and gay streamers of stained cotton floated above it on&#xD;
every side. The cushions upon which the damsel half reclined,&#xD;
rather than sat, were spread with robes of the same richly dyed&#xD;
material. She was clad in similar stuffs, but of finer quality,&#xD;
and rich fringe depended from her skirts and shoulders. 11cr&#xD;
hair, black as ebony, and glossily bright, floated free, but wa~&#xD;
woven thick with ropes of pearl; frequent strands of pearl en-&#xD;
circled her neck, falling free upon her bosom. Her sandals&#xD;
~rere also sown with pearl, and she wore anklets of the same&#xD;
precious decorations. Numerous young girls, tearing baskets.of&#xD;
flowers, and habited like herself followed in her train; and she&#xD;
was attended by goodly bands of spearinen and archers, all&#xD;
richly and picturesquely habited, and equally prepared for action&#xD;
and display. Before her, went several musicians, who blew the&#xD;
conch, shook the rattle, beat the drum, and played upoii a rude&#xD;
sort of syrinx made of reeds, which gave forth a long succession&#xD;
of sweet but melancholy sounds. Others kept pace close besk~e the&#xD;
litter, whose office it was to wave before her huge fans of parti-&#xD;
colored feathers, the plumage of the wil~I birds of the Floridian,&#xD;
gathered from all quarters, and wrought with an art which leaves&#xD;
the modern fan of Europe but little of superiority to boast.&#xD;
In this state, the Spaniards were allowed to behold her pro-&#xD;
gress through the forests for awhile, when she suddenly disap-&#xD;
peared in its deeper recesses with all her train. But her disap-&#xD;
pearance was for a brief space only. Very soon a great canoe,&#xD;
of the largest size and most magnificently decorated, with cush-&#xD;
ions, and canopies, and broad fringes and streamers of richly and&#xD;
variously stained cotton, was seen to emerge 'from the mouth of&#xD;
a creek that ran close beside the promontory on which stood the&#xD;
sylvan temple of Cofachiqui. In this canoe, under the canopy,&#xD;
reclined the princess in the stern, upon a pile of cushions. She&#xD;

was attended by eight beautifi4 girls, only less richly]&#xD;
than herself. Her barge was accompanied, or rather&#xD;
another ~f like dimensions, in which sat the six chieftain&#xD;
had constituted the deputation. A cloud of, can es, of a]&#xD;
filled with warriors, followed after and closed he pro&#xD;
which now, under the impelling strokes of har y rowei&#xD;
made its way to the opposite shore. When arri ed, the&#xD;
princess, unassisted, but followed by all her train, tept fe~&#xD;
to the land, and the Spaniards were greatly struc by the&#xD;
grace of her movements, the admirable symmet y of hei&#xD;
the beauty and. innocence, as well as intelligent e of he&#xD;
and the picturesque appropriateness of her costu e. D&#xD;
made the most imposing preparations to give her corresi&#xD;
welcome. Her obeisance to the Adelantado.w s full o&#xD;
and dignity; and this made, she se4ed herself on a sort c&#xD;
which her attendant had brought with her for the purpose,&#xD;
De Soto motioned her to the cl~air of state fron which]&#xD;
self had arisen.&#xD;
A long and interesting conference ensued bctw en the*&#xD;
carried on through Philip de Vasconselos, on w om, it v&#xD;
served by more than one, that the fair princes bestow&#xD;
most encouraging smiles, speaking with as mu sweet~&#xD;
ease and dignity. But the sad face of Philip nev r once (&#xD;
though the whole conference. He was gentle and res&#xD;
but calm~ subdued, and too melancholy to ndte h w flatt&#xD;
himself were the looks of the beautiful Cassiqiie. But Ji&#xD;
page, noted it as well as others; and he turned away ft&#xD;
sight as if disquieted, and retired iuto the rear, eating]&#xD;
gloomily, beneath the old trees of the forest. Juan Oi&#xD;
former interpreter, too, was among the persons rho thoi&#xD;

PHILIP IN PAYO2R.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Such gifts, beautiful Co9alla, are only for a great chief. to&#xD;
wear. Jn~ the noble person who sits in the chair of state, y u&#xD;
behold the great chief of Our people. He will be proud to w ar&#xD;
the pearls of the Queen of Cofachiqui."&#xD;
She looked reproachfully at the knight of Portugal, and s ill&#xD;
hesitated, the pearls hanging from her hands. IDe Soto had b-&#xD;
served her movements keenly. He suspected the truth.&#xD;
"What says she, Don Philip 'e" was his stern and sudden qu s-&#xD;
tion to the knight.&#xD;
It was with a blush that Philip felt the necessity of evad~ g,&#xD;
or suppressing, the truth.&#xD;
"The princess would bestow upon the Adelantado the pea Is&#xD;
which she carries in her hands, but fears to violate decoruni. S e&#xD;
would have me bestow them; but I have counselled her t at&#xD;
the honor will be more graciously felt, if she will make the g ft&#xD;
with her own hands."&#xD;
"Thou art right," was the reply of the Adelantado, and he p-&#xD;
proached more closely and bowed his head. Slowly and rel c-&#xD;
tantly still, but obeying the sign made by Don Philip, t e&#xD;
princess cast the heavy strands over the shoulders of the Adel n-&#xD;
tado, who, seizing her hand as she did so, passed a rich gold ri g,&#xD;
with a ruby, over one of her fingers.&#xD;
With this ceremonial, the conference ended. The princess h~d&#xD;
complied with the desires of the Spaniards. Her boats conveyed&#xD;
them across the river; her people brought them provisions; s~ie&#xD;
received them in her village with favor; and, for a season, the~e&#xD;
was nothing but mutual pleasure and gratification among the&#xD;
parties. The Spaniards were delighted with the grace and beau y&#xD;
of the queen, at which they greatly wondered; and she, as w 11&#xD;
as her people, was equally charmed with the curious strange $&#xD;
who brought with them so many strange and charming objec s.&#xD;
In particular, she thought long, and dwelt much, to her attendant s,&#xD;
upon the handsome warrior, whose voice was so sweet with n&#xD;
her ears. She likened his speech to that of the 'trick tongue' (t e&#xD;
mock-bird), when it is the season for him to seek out a mate, at d&#xD;
win his favorite by the pleasing of his song.&#xD;
But Philip retired 'to sad, rather than sweet thoughts and&#xD;
cies. That night, as he sat at his evening meal beneath a tr e,&#xD;
with Juan in attendance, he was unusually sad and spiritle s.&#xD;
Juan was very gloomy, too, but made an effort to revive t e&#xD;
spirits of his master. He was curious, too, and he chose for Ws.&#xD;
subject the beautiful queen, who was the topic of universal eul&#xD;
gium among the Spaniards.&#xD;

" She is ver-y beautiful, Juan."&#xD;
" That is to say, for a savage Indian ?"&#xD;
" She is one of God's creatures, Juan, and t ere is&#xD;
without its beauties."&#xD;
" But these beauties do not suit the better tas es of a&#xD;
people, Se50or. They are too rude ; and besides these&#xD;
are of the form only ; they lack the corresponden es of ed'&#xD;
and learning, and the charm of accomplishme s, such&#xD;
needful to satisfy the desires of a Christian peopl ."'&#xD;
" Aye, boy ; but if the tastes lack, the virtues ae not&#xD;
There is heart, at least, in the savage rudeness, though&#xD;
lack the artful accomplishments of the refined Eui opean.&#xD;
is no treachery here-no false faith-no base, degi ding p&#xD;

they are to be allied with foul lusts, practised i secret,&#xD;
grievous peril of the soul, and in despite of that .very ed&#xD;

of such practice. Better far, the embrace with the rud&#xD;
simple woman of the Apalachian, than the whited~ sepulcl&#xD;

AT first, nothing could exceed the mutual satisfaction o~ the&#xD;
red men and the Spaniards in their commerce and commu ion.&#xD;
The latter delighted their simple hosts with gifts of curiosity and&#xD;
use, which were at-once new to them .and serviceable. Th~ In-&#xD;
dians, on the other hand, stript their houses and persons, and 4ven&#xD;
their graves, of the pearls which they possessed in great q an-&#xD;
titles, to glut the desires of the strangers. To these gifts were&#xD;
added others which still further aroused the cupidity of oni ad-&#xD;
venturers. Bits of gold and silver were mingled with their&#xD;
spoils, prompting a thousand curious inquiries as to the region&#xD;
whence they came. When told of the provinces of Xualla and&#xD;
Chalaque, where the gold grew, De Soto resolved upon the ex-&#xD;
ploration of these regions also. But he proposed awhile -to re-&#xD;
main where he was; satisfied that he was even now in a worl1 of&#xD;
great mineral treasures. The very appearance of the blufl of&#xD;
Cofachiqui, shining with isinglass and mica, led to dreams of sil-&#xD;
ver ore, which, a few bits found along the shore, seemed gre tly&#xD;
to encourage ;. and while he remained in this neighborhood, he&#xD;
actually undertook the prodigious toll of cutting off an elbor of&#xD;
the river, and turning its water for several miles, in order to lay&#xD;
bare the bed of the stream for the possession of the pree~ ous&#xD;
treasures which were supposed to pave it. The proofs of this&#xD;
great labor, pursued with stern industry and a large bod of&#xD;
workmen, for awhile, are still to be found in the canal, sh wn&#xD;
to this day in these precincts, and which still goes by the nam of&#xD;
the Spanish Cut. But the Adelantado was compelled, tho uh&#xD;
reluctant, to dismiss this pleasant fancy, and abandon the painful&#xD;
labors to which it led, His silver proved to be even less valu-&#xD;
able than lead. It crumbled away at his touch. Better accoi nts&#xD;
reached him from the interior ; accounts which we now know to&#xD;
have been strictly true.&#xD;
Meanwhile, the pleasant relations between the red men nd&#xD;
the white underwent a change. The Spaniards soon bega4 to&#xD;
show the simple natives the sterner aspects of their charade er.&#xD;
Their eager, grasping, despotic temper, began to manifest it elf,&#xD;
as they grew more confident in their position, and more fam'liiar&#xD;

perh ps being much more interested than her ju~gmen&#xD;
she found how difficult it was to keep on terms with a peo&#xD;
avaricious, so tyrannical, and selfish. She looked stcfrnly up&#xD;
Spaniards in general, she looked coldly upon th~ Adela&#xD;
whom an equal inflexibility of will and appetite~ made&#xD;
favored and perpetually exacting. It was upon th~ noble&#xD;
~reter, only, that she cast always sweet and lo ing gl&#xD;
To him she spoke freely of the respects in which he Spa&#xD;
vexed and troubled her.&#xD;
"They rob and wrong my people; they destroy their fi&#xD;
beat them when they complain, and murder them when th~&#xD;
sist. It is no longer easy to procure the provision~ which&#xD;
feed so many mouths. My people grow very impatient.&#xD;

Before Philip could reply, his page Juan, with aspect gloomy&#xD;
and anxious, suddenly entered the apartment, and after a hurijed&#xD;
obeisance, said-                                    I&#xD;
"Seflor, your presence is needed without. There is troUble.&#xD;
The Indians are arming and surrounding some of our pe~pie.&#xD;
There have been blows already betWeen them, and there is an-&#xD;
ger of insurrection."&#xD;
"I must see to this I" said Vasconselos. In a f~~w words he&#xD;
conveyed to the Princess what he had, heard from Juan, and&#xD;
hurriedly took his departure. Juan was about to follow, 'when&#xD;
the Princess beckoned him, and throwing a rich .robe of furs u~pon&#xD;
his shoulders, itiotioned him to accept it, in a sweet and gracious&#xD;
manner. But the boy shook the garment from his shoulders, ~and&#xD;
with a single glance, of a strange and almost savage sternnes~,at&#xD;
the noble giver, wheeled about and hastily followed his lord.&#xD;
The Princess was confounded at this treatment. She had~ be-&#xD;
stowed the gift upon the boy as she had beheld his devotio~ to&#xD;
his master. It was a tribute prompted entirely by her regard for&#xD;
the latter. She could not conjecture the meaning of the bo~$, or&#xD;
the dark and savage look which he gave her; and the rejection of&#xD;
her gift, apart from the manner in which the thing was done, ~vas&#xD;
itself an insult. She expressed her wonder, in her own languiige,&#xD;
and hastily summoned her attendants. These had hardly rAade&#xD;
their appearance, when one of her grave and venerable forest-&#xD;
councillors entered also. His brow was full of trouble. 1-Je&#xD;
hurriedly confirmed the report which she had just heard from&#xD;
Vasconselos, of the difficulty between her people and the Spa-&#xD;
niards, and, anxiouS about the resultL she hurried forth also '~ivith&#xD;
the aged chief; in the hope, by her presence, to quiet the aroused&#xD;
passions of her subjects.&#xD;
When Philip de Vasconselos appeared upon the scene of ~om-&#xD;
motion, the conflict seemed inevitable. The red men were arm-&#xD;
mg every where, and gathering to the conflict. They had l~een&#xD;
goaded beyond their endurance, by the brutalities of some off the&#xD;
Spanish rabble, had resented with blows an unprovoked inj ~ry;&#xD;
and, unwillingly restrained so long, by the authority of their&#xD;
queen, it was now apparent that the outbreak would be pr4or-&#xD;
tionately extreme, from I~he enforced authority which had ~uith-&#xD;
erto kept in subjection their usually untameable passions. The&#xD;
warriors had submitted to the presence and the aggression~ of&#xD;
the Spaniards, against their habitual practice, an~ against 1~heir&#xD;
nature. Fierce, proud, always prepared for, and f~nd of, a~r&#xD;
the. conquerors of all the surrounding tribes,~~ho~r should they&#xD;
submit to the insolence of this handful of stran~rers~ whoi~n it&#xD;

seemed so easy to destroy? The moment had arrived,&#xD;
for the assertion of their strength and independence!&#xD;
The moment was inauspicious for De Soto. O~ie half&#xD;
forces had been dispatched in different bodies, and directj~i&#xD;
the exploration of the country. Nuno de Tobar was pr&#xD;
fifty miles off; with a select body of forty horses, on the ro&#xD;
Achalaque. Juan de Anasco, with a similar force, was a~v&#xD;
another route. So was Gonzalo Sylvestre; so was Andi&#xD;
Yasconselos, with his Portuguese, and other knights. T&#xD;
mains of the army, with De Soto, at the moment 6f comm&#xD;
were scattered along the river banks, or in the forests, fishi&#xD;
fowling. Unless he could quell the commotion Without ti&#xD;
treme of struggle, without absolute violence, he was in dang&#xD;
being utterly destroyed. The princessof Cofachiq~ii could&#xD;
several thousand warriors into the field. It was under the~&#xD;
cumstances that the Adelantado hurried forth, as Philip de&#xD;
conselos had done, in order to interpose his person ~ind auti&#xD;
for the prevention of the strife. It was here that he showe&#xD;
resources of a good head and a long experience. To th4&#xD;
prise equally of his own soldiers and the i~ed men, he sei&#xD;
cudgel and began to belabor the Spaniards, seconded in the&#xD;
ration most heartily by Philip, who had reached the sce&#xD;
~ season for this proper, if not pleasant exercise. The pri&#xD;
appeared at this juncture, and clapped her hands with a soj&#xD;
girlish delight, which contributed to the success of De S&#xD;
policy. The chiefs and sages went ai pongst their 'I~arriors&#xD;
words of counsel; and the outbreak was quelled almost as&#xD;
as it had taken place. The red men retired to their w&#xD;
hardly satisfied, but subdued, they knew not well in what I&#xD;
ner. The Adelantado escorted the princess to her dwelling,&#xD;
partook of a feast which she had prepared. For the moi&#xD;
harmony seemed restored. l3ut it was a hollow amnesty. T&#xD;
were wounds that rankled on both sides, and refused ~o be he~&#xD;
Pride was at work equally in the hearts of the Spaniards&#xD;
red men; and passions, of even a worse order, which the arti&#xD;
of both only labored to conceal-.not overcome.&#xD;
That night, the Adelantado called a council of his chief off&#xD;
at his quarters. Philip de Yasconselos was present with&#xD;
rest.&#xD;
"1 have summoned you, Sefiores," said De Soto, "that&#xD;
may confer together as to the policy before us. You have&#xD;
to-day what is the temper of these savages. For some days]&#xD;
we have witnessed a rising spirit of insolence among them. T&#xD;

there were many speakers, to all of whonkthe remarks of the Ad-&#xD;
chmtado furnished the key-note. All w'ere agreed that the qu en&#xD;
and her subjects were changed in temper towards them; thart it&#xD;
was evident they were regarded no longer as grateful guests, ~u t&#xD;
as burdensome and offensive intruders. But no one sugges~ted&#xD;
the course of action. They all well knew that, while De oto&#xD;
listened patiently to all, he followed no counsel but his own~ or&#xD;
that to which he fully inclined himself. Vasconselos ,alone Was&#xD;
silent.&#xD;
"We woubi hear from Don Philip," said De Soto, with a s lie&#xD;
which had in it something of a sneer. Philip quietly and&#xD;
promptly answered.&#xD;
"There is no question but it is true that these people arc t~ red&#xD;
of us. We have worn out their patience. We have consu~ ed&#xD;
their provisions, occupied their houses, controlled and commanded&#xD;
their labor, enjoyed their hospitality to the full extent of theiil re-&#xD;
'sources; and in return, have beaten and despoiled their men and&#xD;
women, and shown ourselves very ungrateful for all that they&#xD;
have done with us. For my part; I only wonder that they pave&#xD;
tolerated us so long. The admirable drubbing which your Ex-&#xD;
cellency administered this day to some of the runagates who ~iave&#xD;
turned the hearts of this siniple people against us, was quits as&#xD;
much due to justice as to good policy. It might have been w~ll to&#xD;
have administered a little more of it, and to a score or two of&#xD;
other offenders."&#xD;
"Well, but admitting the truth of all this, Seflor Don Phi ip,"&#xD;
responded De Soto, rather impatiently,-" the question is, hat&#xD;
are we to do,-how repair the evii-.--how put ourselves in ecu-&#xD;
rity against such mischance as had so nearly befallen s to-&#xD;
day ?"&#xD;
"The question is an embarrassing one, your Excell ncy,&#xD;
and, perhaps, were better addressed to some of your olde and&#xD;
closer councillors. The solution of it will depi~nd upon yo r ob-&#xD;
jects. Why should we linger here? The silver which we l~oped.&#xD;

will lose us that authority which makes our progress go w&#xD;

us leave them in season, before we have made them despei&#xD;

"Ay, but their favor is already lost. They will send us&#xD;

appear. The Princess Cogalla has grown haughty and indiffer&#xD;

Philip regarded the savage smile upon the countenance of&#xD;

attempt to answer. Don Balthazar do Alvaro now took up&#xD;

"I suspect that few will doubt the necessity of our leav&#xD;

Princess here, but for the spechif regard which possesses her s~ul,&#xD;
in behalf of one ofus. How long this will secure us is a probWm&#xD;
which we shall soon be able to solve, if it be true that the nati'~'es&#xD;
are out of provisions. Now, we are all agreed to depart frod~ia&#xD;
region in which we shall find famine only instead of gold; nd&#xD;
we are agreed also, that we may have to fight our way at every&#xD;
step, and get our provisions only at the end of. our weap ns.&#xD;
Well, with your Excellency's leave, we are in precisely the sa e&#xD;
strait with those great men, Hernan Cortez and Francis Piza ro,&#xD;
and I see not that we can do better than adopt their policy."&#xD;
"What policy ?" quoth the Adelantado.&#xD;
"That of seizing upon the sovereign of the country, and making&#xD;
her a hostage for the good behavior of her people. This P~in-&#xD;
cess of Cofachiqui is in your power. Her people hold her in~ an&#xD;
esteem little short of reverence. Seize her, keep her in ckse&#xD;
custody, under watchful guardianship, and you secure the g~od&#xD;
conduct of her people. You are required now to traverse hun-&#xD;
dreds of miles over which she possesses acknowledged sway: as&#xD;
you pass west, if, you need to do so, you are told that she is&#xD;
closely allied to the great powers of the Apalachian, the Alaba-&#xD;
mous, the Me~hachebe! What follows? The people, in all these&#xD;
places, obey her decrees, bring provisions, bear burdens, submit&#xD;
without blows: The policy of Cortez and Pizarro must be 1~hat&#xD;
of Ilernan do Soto, if he hopes for like success with these heathen&#xD;
savages. It is the only policy for safety."&#xD;
"And I deem it a base and horrid policy, Sefior !" cried Vas-&#xD;
conselos, rising, and speaking with all the warmth of a noble&#xD;
and ingenuous soul, shocked at the cold cruelty and baseness of&#xD;
the counsel given. "0! Don Hernan de Soto, beware how you&#xD;
stain an honorable fame, by the adoption of a policy so shame-&#xD;
ful, so shocking, so dreadfully ungrateful. This young Princess&#xD;
has received you with highest honors, has treated you with unva-&#xD;
rying kindness, has yielded from her. stores all that she possesses.&#xD;
As a Christian gentleman, and loyal cavalier, you cannot follow&#xD;
counsels which shall violate every trusted virtue, every security&#xD;
of feeling and of honor."&#xD;
The brow of Do Soto darkened terribly.&#xD;
"You employ strong language, Don Philip do Vasconse~os;&#xD;
but you may have special reasons for doing so. You, at kast,&#xD;
would seem to owe special favors to this dusky Princess.~~&#xD;

The pale cheeks of Philip reddened, but he was silent The&#xD;
Adelantado proceeded:&#xD;
"But our obligations are general only, and shared with 1 the&#xD;
chiefs of my army. You hear how they express themselves , and&#xD;
what they counsel. In great necessities, nice scruples are ~cious&#xD;
impediments, and we may not apply to great embarrassed. tis the&#xD;
principles we submit to when the currents of life flow sm ~thly&#xD;

counsel of IDon Balthazar to be the only 'means of esca ~ and&#xD;
progress in this our emergency. It is our necessity, whi~ we&#xD;
cannot escape."&#xD;
"0! say not so, your Excellency-" began Philip d4~ Vas-&#xD;
conselos, but the truncheon of the Adelantado came do4wn heavily&#xD;
upon the table,-and he thundered out-.&#xD;
"We have decided, gentlemen-we are resolved-the c ~inci1&#xD;
is dissolved, We shall see to these things with early mo fling.&#xD;
Be you each prepared, in armor, to second all my orders."&#xD;
The council dispersed, each to his own quarters, all leavi g the&#xD;
Adelantado, except Don Baithazar, who had other matt ~s to&#xD;
insinuate when he did n9t counsel. Philip de Vasconselos, gr ~ived&#xD;
to the heart, retired to his lowly lodgings, where he sat do#ito&#xD;
his silent supper, of which he scarcely ate, attended by Ju~n in&#xD;
silence.&#xD;
"0! boy, boy 1" he exclaimed, suddenly-" thou little know-&#xD;
est, boy," he proceeded-" b~ft if the heart of woman be ~cu-&#xD;
rably false, that of man is terribly base! If her heart be '~eak&#xD;
as water, his is more hard and unfeeling than the pitiless iock.&#xD;
I am sick, Juan, very sick of all things that live !"&#xD;
And the supper was pushed away; and the knight threw h~m-&#xD;
self on his couch of reeds and brush, under. the roof of his sii~ple&#xD;
Indian lodge which had given him shelter, and he felt to wl~t a&#xD;

much thought, and long after midnight he arose, and he mutt9red&#xD;
to himself-&#xD;
"It shall not be! I will prevent this dreadful treachery !'~&#xD;
And he stole forth even as he spoke, carrying his sword be-&#xD;

fl~ Which Was not proper to be sub-&#xD;

2rence properly concerns our drama, it Was at the close of their&#xD;
discourse that De Soto gave it in charge to Don Baithazar, to&#xD;
arrest the Princess and put her under safeguard.&#xD;
"There need be no violence, Setior Baithazar, if your Proceed..&#xD;

"Better an hour or two before," was the answer of the Don.&#xD;
"The Indians may be put on the alert by sunrise."&#xD;
"What! you do not suspect Don Philip ?"&#xD;
"lie is a favorite with the Princess"&#xD;
"But I should think her no great favorite with him, lie seems&#xD;
to treat her with great reserve, if. not coldness."&#xD;
"Reserve is apt to be only a prudent masking of the pas-&#xD;
Sions."&#xD;
But would he dare to play us false !"&#xD;
"Ah! this would scarcely be considered a treachery; or only&#xD;
such as were becoming in a good knight. We can, at all events,&#xD;
better guard against than punish such a treachery."&#xD;
"Ay, by the holy cross, but I should punish such a treachery,&#xD;

"Verily, and I should hark on, and say well done, your Ex-&#xD;

false, and -"&#xD;
I The threat was unspoken, or was sufficiently expressed is-i the&#xD;
angry gesture, and the heavy stroke with which, with clenched&#xD;
fist, he smote the rude table at which the parties were s~ated.&#xD;
In a little while after this, Don Balthazar took his leave.&#xD;
lie proceeded almost instantly to collect a select body 4~f his&#xD;
followers, all armed, for the capture of the Princess Co9alla.&#xD;
This labor occupied some time. He had to move with al~ pre-&#xD;
cautions, rout up soldiers who were sleeping, and hunt up others&#xD;
who, were scattered; and this brought him to a tolerably lat~ hour&#xD;
in the night. By that time Philip de Vasconselos had already&#xD;
proceeded on his generous mission, of arousing the Princ4ss to&#xD;
the necessity of flight, and ere Don Balthazar had set his little&#xD;
squ~d in motion: but the latter was not delayed much longer.&#xD;
Still, the Portuguese Knight is in season for his object, if there&#xD;
should occur no embarrassments.&#xD;
It was no small one, however, that of finding access 1~o the&#xD;
Princess. She occupied a centre mansion, rude enough fo~ roy-&#xD;
alty, so far as we refer to the agencies of art, but a most royal&#xD;
abode if we look only to the natural accessories. That great&#xD;
home of forest oaks, and hickories, and walnuts, towering ~asses&#xD;
of wood and shrubbery-a mighty colonnade of gigantic forms,&#xD;
conducting through numerous airy avenues to the lowly mansion&#xD;
of logs, surrounded by a shady roof of thatched poles,-a~ am-&#xD;
ple verandah of green, surrounding the habitation, which nestled&#xD;
in the great shelter of the ancient forest-was an abode or an&#xD;
Emperor. In this verandah slept a score or'more of wa~'riors&#xD;
always ready, armed with feathered shaft, and flint-headed spear,&#xD;
and obsidian bludgeon, stone tomahawk and knife of flint No&#xD;
Emperor ever possessed subjects more faithful and devote&amp;amp; The&#xD;
space of forest surrounding the abode of the Princess was filled&#xD;
up with scattered parties of other warriors, who slept b neath&#xD;
the trees when the weather was fair, and who kept watch from&#xD;
hidden huts, when the storm descended. They were as vigilant&#xD;
as faithful.&#xD;
Hardly had Philip de Vasconselos entered the tabooed pre-&#xD;
cincts, when a dozen spears were at his breast.&#xD;
"Lead me to your queen," he said in calm, but commanding&#xD;
accents-~-~" she is in danger. I must see her."&#xD;
A brief and rapid consultation ensued among the forest watch-&#xD;
ers. The result was favorable to the wishes of the knight, sim-,&#xD;
ply as all knew him to be the favorite of Co9alla. l~ e was&#xD;
scarcely a less favorite among her people. He was conducted&#xD;

lodge, a conch, which hung from one of the pillars of the veran..&#xD;
Was sounded by One of the watchers at the porch. A door&#xD;
opened~ and a Whispered conversation ensued between the guard&#xD;
and some One within. A brief Space, and Philip was adirlitted&#xD;
to an antechamber a great hall, indeed, at bue side of which stood&#xD;
a maiden with a blazing torch. Juar~ remained in waiting with..&#xD;
out the verandah, anxious to press forward, and trembling with&#xD;
anxiety, yet dreading what he should behold. But, for awhile,&#xD;
his courage failed him, leaving his anxiety unrepressed&#xD;
But a few moments had elapsed, a~er    's entrance into&#xD;
the hall,                            Philip&#xD;
when the princess made her appearance She was clad&#xD;
simple white cotton garden~5 hastily caught up. It needed&#xD;
little time or effort to adjust the costume of the native prin-&#xD;
cess. She was followed by a group of damsels, and one or two&#xD;
matrons. In a few moments after, several old men made their&#xD;
appearance~ from contiguous dormitories.&#xD;
There was a joyous eagerness in the face of the brigh~eye~&#xD;
Co9alla, as she looked upon the knight.&#xD;
"Philip I" She had learned to call his name very prettily2..&#xD;
"Philip !" and the rest she spoke in her own language, taking his&#xD;
hand frankly as she spoke.&#xD;
"What would the Voice of the Spaniard with Co~alla? It is&#xD;
not the hour of council. The bird that sings by day, sleeps in&#xD;
the darkness. The war~ sle&#xD;

"It is not for that I come, noble Co~alla. But there is danger&#xD;
for the princess. My people have said Co9alla must be ours!&#xD;
She must march with Our army to the great mountains She&#xD;
must be the hostage for her people. She must fbllow the path&#xD;

"ha! say'st thou! Thou shalt see." And she whispered to&#xD;
her attendants, one of whom disappeared.&#xD;
"The princess must fly to the deep forests," continued Yas-&#xD;
conselos. "There alone can she be safe from our people."&#xD;
"Fly! and from my home,-whife n~y warriors are around&#xD;
me? Never! never !-And yet-" speaking quickly-" Will&#xD;
Philip g.o with me to my lodge in the great forests.? Will he&#xD;
become a warrior of Cofachiqui? Say, Philip,-wilt thou go&#xD;
with me, and find a lodge among my people-and becon~ea&#xD;
chief-the great chief-the 'well-beloved of Cofachiqui?' And&#xD;
she 'caught his hand eagerly.&#xD;
"Alas !" he said, "I cannot, beautiful Co9alla-my lot is Cast&#xD;
among the Spaniards."&#xD;
"Then will I meet them here. I will gather my wa~'r~or~.&#xD;
They shall fight these Spaniards-they shall fall upon them, and&#xD;
slay them all-all but thee, Philip. Thou shalt be a great chief&#xD;
of Cofachiqui."&#xD;
A group of old men entered at this moment, and were ap-&#xD;
prised of what Vasconselos had reported. They received the in-&#xD;
formation gravely. They heard their princess as she invei~hed&#xD;
loudly against the insolent purpose of the Spaniards. She bade&#xD;
them gather the warriors together, and meet their enemy. She&#xD;
was resolved not to fly, unless-and she turned again to the&#xD;
knight-&#xD;
"Will not Philip go with Co9alla to the great forests her&#xD;
people, and. be a chief of Cofachiqui ?"&#xD;
lie shook his head mournfully. The old chiefs interfered.&#xD;
Philip un erstood all that they spoke, though in low tone~, to&#xD;
their quee . They, too, exhorted her to take the counsel of Vas-&#xD;
conselos, a d seek safety in flight. At the moment, they ~vere&#xD;
unprepared for conflict. Their warriors about the village were&#xD;
few in nu ber, hardly more than necessary for a body-guard of&#xD;
honor for heir sovereign. It required time to call in the warri-&#xD;
ors, and t prepare for such enemies as those with whom they&#xD;
had to dea, and the terrible resources of which were already, in.&#xD;
part, kno i to the chiefs. But the princess grew unreason-&#xD;
able; still recurring, at the close of her speech, to the one bur..&#xD;
den, in th appeal to Philip-" to find a lodge among, and bea~&#xD;
chief ove her people-the chief!" The old warriors looked&#xD;
grave. T ey renewed their counsels and expostulations. whey&#xD;
were seco ded by the earnest entreaties of Vasconselos. S~u&#xD;
said to hu~a reproachfully-&#xD;
"Does Philip bid me go from him where I can ~ee hi~n n~&#xD;

&#xD;
more '~ Does Philip say to Co~alla-let the forests grow be.&#xD;
tween us, so that our eyes shall, never meet again? Ah! Philip !"&#xD;
and she laid her hand, as if with pain, upon her heart. The&#xD;
knight felt very wretched at the wretchedness he was compelled&#xD;
to inflict, and a vague but beguiling thought passed through his&#xD;
-Ahncy for an instant, with the rapidity of an arrow of light.&#xD;
"And why should I not depart with this true-hearted arid in-&#xD;
nocent princess ?-She is young. and beautiful, and powerful, and&#xD;
more than all, pure of thought and feeling. Why should I fol-&#xD;
low in the steps of those who hate, when I am persuaded by&#xD;
those who love ~"&#xD;
But he dismissed the seductive argument with the resolute ex-&#xD;
ertion of his wilL The very thought of love, and of another wo-&#xD;
man, while his heart was still so sore with the most humiliating&#xD;
experience of the sex, was a revolting thought. He hastily ex-&#xD;
pelled it~from his mind.&#xD;
i-" Heed not me," he said, "noble Princess :-I am but an in.&#xD;
sect in thy path. I am nothing."&#xD;
"Thou art every thing, Philip, to Co9alla. My people will&#xD;
honor thee for my sake, and thou shalt be a chief among them.&#xD;
And thou shalp dwell in a lodge with Co9alla, and there shall be&#xD;
no Spaniards in the great forests where we go. Thou shalt be&#xD;
a chief of my people, Philip,-thou shalt be the only chief for&#xD;
Co9alla."&#xD;
And With these words, in the eager impulse of a passion which&#xD;
was no less pure than warm,-the passion of a nature wholly un-&#xD;
sophisticated, no longer able' to restrain her feelings, she threw&#xD;
her arms around the neck of Vasconselos, and laid her head upon&#xD;
his breast.. Her long, dark tresses fell like a shower of starry&#xD;
night over his shoulders.&#xD;
At that moment, and before the knight could recover himself;&#xD;
he felt his arm plucked from behind, and the voice of Juan&#xD;
sounded huskily in his ears.&#xD;
"See you not, Senor, that unless you tear yourself away f~'om&#xD;
her, she will not depart? She will be captured, unless you leave&#xD;
her at once! Already Don Balthazar is; gathering his troop to&#xD;
surround the village of the princess. Fly from her in season, or&#xD;
she is surely taken. These moments are fatally lost."&#xD;
Vasconselos heard, and tenderly but firmly he unwound the&#xD;
arms of the princess from about his neck. At this act, silently&#xD;
performed, she turned, with a sudden' revulsion of feeling, and&#xD;
threw herself on the bosom of one of the matrons, while her&#xD;
sobs sounded distinctly through the apartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
JUAN IS REBUKED.                  425&#xD;
"Now now !" cried Juan, in quick, eager accents, as Philip&#xD;
lingered---- Now is the moment, Seflor. She will fly when you&#xD;
are gone fr m sight."&#xD;
"You ar right, boy, right!" answered the knight. The hand&#xD;
of Juan ea erly grasped that of his superior, and led him away&#xD;
from the a artment and into the woods, without a moment's de-&#xD;
lay. They were within a few paces of the lodging of Vasconse&#xD;
los, when t cy heard a slight blast of a trumpet in the thicket&#xD;
between th m and the abode of the Princess.&#xD;
"It is th signal of Don Balthazar," said Juan hurriedly. "We&#xD;
are safe ;" nd he drew the knight into the l~odge.&#xD;
"But Co alla ~" said Philip.&#xD;
"She has had time enough for escape if she willed it; but me-&#xD;
thinks she ould rather be a captive were Don Philip the jailer,&#xD;
than be the free Princess of all these forests."&#xD;
There wa something of bitterness in the accents of the boy.&#xD;
Philip note it, but his mind was too full of anxiety, in respect&#xD;
to the escap of Oo~alla, to dwell upon minor matters.&#xD;
"Now m y the Saints forbid I" he ejaculated.&#xD;
"This. pr ncess seems very precious to the Senor !" quoth&#xD;
Juan, moodi y.&#xD;
"As nobi ity, and generosity of soul, and true virtue in a wo.&#xD;
man, should ever be to every noble knight !" responded Philip,&#xD;
somewhat s ernly; and Juan shrunk away, as if an arrow 'had&#xD;
pierced him suddenly in the breast; and Vasconselos heard no&#xD;
more words from him that night. The boy had gone aside to&#xD;
bury his fac in the leaves of his couch, and to weep in secret, as&#xD;
was his nigh ly custom and necessity.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
"va I se hai cara la vita."&#xD;
&#xD;
Am~x~R.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE effort of Don Philip had been made in vain. The Prin-&#xD;
cess Co~alla gave herself up to a passion of grief; that resisted&#xD;
argument and entreaty. She became fully conscious of her&#xD;
danger (of which even the assurance of' Vasconselos had failed&#xD;
to possess her mind)-of the danger which awaited her, only&#xD;
when it was too late. It was only. when the shrill blast of the&#xD;
Spanish trumpet, speaking in signal to the co-operating squad,&#xD;
and the crash of conflicting weapons, had struck upon her senses,&#xD;
that she consented to make the attempt to escape. But, by this&#xD;
time, the building was entirely surrounded, and she was seized&#xD;
by a group of common soldiers, as she strove to steal away from&#xD;
the rear during the struggle between her warriors and the assail-&#xD;
ants. Her people fought despTerately, even the old chiefs and&#xD;
counsellors, but only to be butchered. The dawn saw her vil-&#xD;
lage smoking with blood and herself a captive.&#xD;
The Princess was from this moment kept under close restraint,&#xD;
well watched and guarded, but treated with forbearance, if not&#xD;
with kindness. She was allowed a litter to be borne upon the&#xD;
shoulders of her own people, when she was indisposed to walk.&#xD;
The Adelantado, for awhile, paid her a morning visit, as Cortez&#xD;
had done to Montezuma, in which he maintained all the most&#xD;
deferential externals. She did not reproach, nor entreat; but&#xD;
from the moment when she became a captive, she habited her-&#xD;
self in the stern reserve of character so peculiar to the red men&#xD;
of America, and haughtily refused communion with her treach-&#xD;
erous and ungrateful guest. But her captivity disarmed her&#xD;
people. They dared not rebel against the authority whose sim-&#xD;
ple decree might destroy the head of the nation. 'They submit-&#xD;
ted every where-submitted as Tamenes, or porters, to bear the..&#xD;
luggage of the army, and brought in provisions throughout the&#xD;
country, wherever the Spaniards came or sent.&#xD;
* The army was set in motion soon after the arrest of the Princess,'&#xD;
and the young and noble Co~alla was borne along with it, unresist-&#xD;
ing, as ~recklessly as the tides of ocean bear away upon their dis-&#xD;
cordant billows, th&amp;amp;beautif'ul and innocent flower which the tem-&#xD;

a seeming good-will, which left them wholly with-&#xD;

VASCONSELO8.&#xD;
&#xD;
They instantly sought, by a vigorous search in the neighboring&#xD;
woods, to repair the consequences of their fault. Unfortunately,&#xD;
they had missed the ca#tive too soon after her flight, to enable&#xD;
her to escape very far. She was found; her followers ~aflantly&#xD;
threw themselves in the path of the pursuers, and armed only&#xD;
with sticks or billets, hastily snatched up in the forest, endeavored&#xD;
to~defend their mistress. But they were immediately butchered.&#xD;
Co9alla, who had continued her flight, was soon overtaken, and&#xD;
violently seized by Pedro Martin. The bold ruffian, goaded by&#xD;
licentious passions, dragged her into the covert, while Gil Torres'&#xD;
stood by, as if keeping sentry. Her cries rang through the&#xD;
woods, and not in vain. They called up a champion in the peril-&#xD;
ous moment.&#xD;
Don Philip de Vasconselos had not lost sight of the beautiful&#xD;
Princess who had so fearlessly shown him how precious he was&#xD;
in her eyes. But he forbore to trespass upon the indulgence&#xD;
which she had sho~vn him, and, with a rare modesty and forbear.&#xD;
ance, a delicacy of consideration, which had few parallels in that&#xD;
day amongst these wild adventurers, he steadily rejected the&#xD;
temptations which were held out to him by the warmth of her&#xD;
affection and the confiding innocence of her nature. He stu-&#xD;
diously forbore her presence, except when specially required to&#xD;
communicate with her by De Soto himself. In fact, there was&#xD;
a policy, as well as propriety, in this forbearance. XTasconselos&#xD;
had discovered that he was watched. Juan, his page, had made&#xD;
some discoveries, to this effect, and had made them known imme-&#xD;
diately to the knight. lie was watched by the creatures of Don&#xD;
Balthazar. This was the amount of the discovery: and there&#xD;
were suspicious circumstances, coupled with the conduct of Juan&#xD;
Ortiz, the interpreter, whose jealousy had been kindled, ~nt the&#xD;
expense of Vasconselos, in consequence of the better knowledge&#xD;
of the Indian tongues which the latter possessed. lie had lost&#xD;
som~e of his authority with 'the Spaniards during the period when&#xD;
the ortuguese knight served wholly as the medium of commu-&#xD;
nication between the red men and the' white. Ortiz possessed,&#xD;
however, a rare natural capacity for the acquisition of language,&#xD;
and, with a strong m6tF~re to goad his industry, in his pride, his&#xD;
mortification, and his love of ease-.for, when not interpreting,&#xD;
he was required to serve in the ranks as a common soldier-he&#xD;
addressed himself to the task of picking up the dialect of the&#xD;
people of the new~ regions into which he passed. He had become&#xD;
to a certain extent successful, so that he was now able to under-&#xD;
stand and conjecture the purport of the' various conversations&#xD;
between the Princess and the knight, whenever they took place W&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PAGE IS JEALOUS.                 429&#xD;
public. On 11 these occasions, Co~alla freely gave vent to her&#xD;
affections, an spoke with Vasconselos as frankly in respect to&#xD;
her love, as I no other ear but his own could comprehend the&#xD;
purport of h r speech. All this matter was reported to Don&#xD;
Baithazar, w 0, by the way, had been repulsed by the Princess&#xD;
in every app oach which he had made to familiarity with her.&#xD;
how Juan, t e Moorish page, had ascertained these facts, may&#xD;
not now be s id, but he had learned enough to set his master on&#xD;
his guard aga iist the subtle Ortiz and other spies employed by&#xD;
his enemy.&#xD;
But though cautious, and avoiding as much as possible all in-&#xD;
tercourse wit the Princess, Vasconselos watched over her safety&#xD;
as ten~~rly a if he returned her affection. He had seen the&#xD;
growing mdi erence of De Soto to the claims and character of&#xD;
the Pr~.ncess, nd he strove, whenever he could do so without&#xD;
provoking su picion, to lighten her bonds and soften her mortifi-&#xD;
cation~. The boy, Juan, was sometimes sent with tributes to&#xD;
Co~alla, with delicacies which she might not else procure; and&#xD;
we may add hat, though he obeyed the knight, he yet did so&#xD;
with some r luctance. More than once he expostulated with&#xD;
Philip upon he risk which he incurred, by his attentions, and&#xD;
strove to ala mu his fears; but he soon found that such sugges-&#xD;
tions only ins ired the knight with audacity. He then ventured&#xD;
to change hi mode of attack, and would speak, with a sneer,&#xD;
about the inc paucity of the red woman to appreciate either the&#xD;
delicacy of' is gifts or his attentions. But to this suggestion,&#xD;
also, the repl of the knight was apt to silence, for awhile, the&#xD;
presumption f the page.&#xD;
"Cease," o e day he said to Juan-i--" cease, boy, to prate of&#xD;
what thou k owest. not. I tell thee that this heathen prin-&#xD;
cess is a mor beautiful soul in my sight, than any that I know&#xD;
of paler blo d. And why shouldst thou, a blackamoor, pre-&#xD;
sume to snee at the complexion which is more akin to that of&#xD;
the Christian han thine own? Go to, for a foolish boy, and say&#xD;
nothing mor in this wise; for verily, sometimes, when thou&#xD;
speakest thus, I am almost tempted to hold thee an enemy to this&#xD;
most gracious yet luckless princess; whofn I hold in such e~teein,&#xD;
boy, and reg rd, that if I had yet a heart to give, or a faith to&#xD;
yield, to wo 'an, I should prefer to trust in her, than to any liv-&#xD;
ing beauty in all Spain or Portugal."&#xD;
Such spee hes were always apt to humble and to silence the&#xD;
page for a se son. The knight no ways withheld his kindnesses&#xD;
and protection from the princess, because of the counsels of the&#xD;
boy. Yet he suffered her not to see that he watched over her;&#xD;

&#xD;
and now, when the passions of the rude and licentious rufilan&#xD;
Pedro Martin had dragged her into the deep thickets, and she&#xD;
shrieked aloud in her last and worst terrors for a champion to&#xD;
save her, she had little reason to think that the chief whom she&#xD;
loved before all, would suddenly appear to her rescue.&#xD;
Philip de Vasconselos was fortunately at hand. He heard&#xD;
th~ cries of the captive princess. He recognized the voice, lie&#xD;
knew the present licentious moods of the Spaniards. He had&#xD;
denounced, as a terrible crime, that requisition upon the Cassique&#xD;
of Chiaha, which had outraged his people, and driven them away&#xD;
to the shelter of the woods. His instinct instantly conceived the&#xD;
danger of the princess; the neglect and disregard of De Soto&#xD;
tending to encourage the audacity of those who were appointed, to&#xD;
watch over her. He called to Juan, and hurried with sword&#xD;
drawn into the thickets. He was suddenly confronted by Gil&#xD;
Torres.&#xD;
"It is nothing, SeAor Don Philip, but the cries of the heathen&#xD;
woman, the Princess of Cofachiqui, who has been seeking to make&#xD;
escape from us, and whom my comrade, Pedro, has just se-&#xD;
cured."&#xD;
"Stand aside, fellow.-I must see this comrade of thine."&#xD;
Martin raised his lance, and caught the knight by the wrist to&#xD;
detain him. With one blow of his gauntletted fist, Vas~onselos&#xD;
smote him to the earth,-where he lay senseless. Philip hurried&#xD;
into the thicket, where Co9alla still struggled with all her might&#xD;
against the brutal assailant. But she was almost exhausted.&#xD;
She could no longer shriek. She could only oppose. Her long&#xD;
black hair, which swept the ground, was floating dishevelled, her&#xD;
garments were torn, her 'hands w&amp;amp;e bloody. At this periloi(s&#xD;
moment she saw the approach of the knight of Portugal. She&#xD;
knew him at a glance. She could only murmur, "Philip," and&#xD;
her strength failed her. She sank down senseless. At the sight&#xD;
of Vasconselos, the ruffian fled.&#xD;
The knight raised the princess from the ground.&#xD;
"Bring water,-Juan."&#xD;
The boy obeyed, bringing the water in the knight's helmet,&#xD;
which he threw to him for the purpose. He dashed the face of&#xD;
the princess with the cooling sprinkle, lie poured the grateful&#xD;
draught into her lips. She opened her eyes. They lightened&#xD;
with joy. She threw her arms round his neck, and cried-&#xD;
f~ "Philip! 0 Philip !"&#xD;
"You must fly," he said-." fly, Co~alla. Do not waste the&#xD;
precious moments now. It is your only chance. Use it. I will&#xD;
keep off these villains."&#xD;
&#xD;
COCALTuA FREE.                  431&#xD;
He shoo himself free from her, and darted away. She stood&#xD;
mournfully looking at him for a while, then waved her hand to&#xD;
him, and cr ed-&#xD;
"Philip! Philip I"&#xD;
He disappeared in the opposite woods; and she turned away,&#xD;
with claspe~l hands, and moving with slow footsteps, bending&#xD;
form, and a very mournful aspect, murmuring as she went, the&#xD;
one word" ~Philip." She too was soon buried, out of sight, in&#xD;
the she1terii~g bosom of the mighty forest.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
"There is my pledge! I'll prove it on thy heart,&#xD;
Ere I taste bread, thoti art in nothing, less&#xD;
Than I have here proclaimed thee."&#xD;
KING LIIAR.&#xD;
WRaE these events were in progress, in and about the precincts&#xD;
of the Indian town of Ohiaha, Hernando de Soto was absent from&#xD;
the place. He had led a portion of his forces in pursuit of the&#xD;
fugitive red men, who had left their village in consequence of the&#xD;
brutal requisition to render u~ their women; and a report of the&#xD;
gathering &amp;amp; a large body of the savages, in a hostile attitude,&#xD;
not far ofi; had aroused all the eager fury of the Spanish govern.&#xD;
or, to pursue and punish them. He had pursued with his&#xD;
*       usual energy, but without encountering the subtle enemy, who,&#xD;
when they pleased, could readily cover themselves, in such peu-&#xD;
fect concealment in the deeper forests, that the whole army of the&#xD;
Adelantado could never ferret them out, or bring them to battle.&#xD;
Dc Soto rested his troops, after the fruitless pursuit, in a be~uti-&#xD;
ful wood, about half a day's journey from the town of Chiaha.&#xD;
Here he waited the return of certain of his officers, whom he had&#xD;
sent on exploring journeys higher up the country. Nuno de&#xD;
Tobar was thus absent with twenty lances: Andres de Vascon.&#xD;
selos had been sent forward with hi&amp;amp; 'ortuguese, to feel his way&#xD;
along the banks of the Coosaw, and to prepare for the~ coining&#xD;
of the army. There were a few other leaders of the Spanish&#xD;
host, who, like these, might have had sympathies with Philip de&#xD;
Vasconselos, who were also most inopportunely absent.. There&#xD;
was probably some design and management in an arrangement,&#xD;
which, at this juncture, removed from the neighborhood the few&#xD;
persons who might have resisted the perpetration of a cruel wrong,&#xD;
and brought back the moods of Dc Soto to such a condition, as&#xD;
would, at least, have tempered the seventies which he might else&#xD;
suppose were required byjustice.&#xD;
The star of Don Balthazar de Alvaro was, at this moment,&#xD;
completely in the ascendant. He had been left in charge of the&#xD;
village of Chiaha, when Dc Soto undertook the pursuit of the&#xD;
fugitive Indians. It was his task to assign the guards to the&#xD;
Princess of Cofachiqui; to regulate and control, in fact, all the&#xD;
operations within his command, according to his own discretion.&#xD;
(432)&#xD;
&#xD;
MALICE GI~OW~ EXULTANT.               4~3&#xD;
It was no~ the purpose of De Soto to return to the village,&#xD;
but to proceed Qnward, following the footsteps of the pioneer&#xD;
force of Ai~dre5 de Vasconselos to the country of the Alabamas.&#xD;
With thi~ large discretion in his hands, Don Baithazar was&#xD;
not the person to forego the gratification of any of his passions~&#xD;
The person~ whom he had appointed to take charge of the prin-&#xD;
cess Co9a11a~ were his own creatures, the most despicable of the&#xD;
common soldiers of his division. Don Baithazar had been&#xD;
scorned by the princess. He knew the wild licentiousness which.&#xD;
at this time possessed the army. He knew the character of those&#xD;
to whose tender mercies he entrusted her. He might have pre-&#xD;
dicted the event, if he did not,-perhaps he anticipated it; perhaps&#xD;
he anticipated other fruits from the epidemic of license which&#xD;
prevailed among the soldiers. It is not improbable that when he&#xD;
was found by the ruffian, Pedro, who fled from the rapier of Don&#xD;
Philip, conveniently in waiting in a lonely lodge on the edge of&#xD;
the forest, that he himself had prompted his myrmidons to their&#xD;
brutality, and that he had Qther passions. to gratify, not less wild&#xD;
and intense than that of revenge.&#xD;
Great was the wrath of Don Balthazar when Pedro Martin&#xD;
made his report. Gil Torres, with a bloody sconce, made his&#xD;
appearance soon after, which confirmed it. The report was such&#xD;
that, by their own showing, no good Christians could have been&#xD;
more innocent of vil, or virtuously set upon doing good. !The&#xD;
subordinates saved their superior from much of the necessity of&#xD;
invention; and w ere they failed as artists, he supplied the de-&#xD;
fects in their case. They were prepared to affirm it with due&#xD;
solemnities; and, hus armed, Don Baithazar smote one hand&#xD;
with the other, an exclaimed exultingly,-&#xD;
"Now, SeAor on Philip, I have thee at extremity. Thou&#xD;
canst not escape m now."&#xD;
He dismissed th two soldiers. He called up Juan Ortiz, the&#xD;
interpreter, to a pr vate conference. He had secured the agency&#xD;
of this simple fello , who was naturally hostile to the Potuguese&#xD;
knight, as the latte had so often superseded him in that employ-&#xD;
ment, from which e derived so much of his importance with the&#xD;
army. Don Balth zar had tutored Ortiz already to his purposes,&#xD;
while persuading t e interpreter that they were entirely his own.&#xD;
He, too, had certain evidence to give in respect to the treason of Don&#xD;
Philip-for this w' s the serious charge which Don Balthazar was&#xD;
preparing to brin against our knight of Portugal. For some&#xD;
time he had been oncocting his schemes in secret. Like some&#xD;
great spider, lurki g unseen in obscure corner, he had spread&#xD;
forth his numerous silent, unsuspecteA snares, like flue threads,&#xD;

PARTING OF KNIGHT AND PAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
to be wrought by patient malice into meshes, so strong as to&#xD;
bind utterly the unwary victim. Hi~ meshes were now complete.&#xD;
The victim was in the toils, and he had now only to proceed to&#xD;
destroy him at his leisure.&#xD;
Furious that the Princess Co~aIla should escape, he was yet&#xD;
delighted that the event afforded him evidence so conclusive&#xD;
against Vasconselos. He prepared his despatches with all care&#xD;
to De Soto. He set forth the facts in the case, and his inferences.&#xD;
He suggested the course of procedure. He knew but too well&#xD;
in what way to act upon the enormouss self-esteem of the Ade.&#xD;
lantado, already sufficiently proWoked with Don Philip, and by&#xD;
what subtle artifices of suggestion to open to his eyes the most&#xD;
vast and various suspicions of the guilt of the man he sought to&#xD;
destroy. Yet all this, though done boldly, was done adroitly,&#xD;
so that De Soto never fancied himself taught or counselled; and,&#xD;
acting promptly, on the very suggestions given by Don Baitha-&#xD;
zar, he yet fancied, all the while, that he was the master of his&#xD;
own purposes.&#xD;
He sent hack instant dispatches in reply to those which he&#xD;
received. It followed that, at midnight, Philip de Vasconselos&#xD;
was summoned, in most respectful terms, to the quarters of Don&#xD;
Balthazar.&#xD;
He prepared at once to obey. Juan, the page, would have&#xD;
followed him; but the summons of the Don had entreated him&#xD;
to a secret conference, and Philip gave the boy in charge of his&#xD;
lodge, and commanded him to remain where he was, awaiting&#xD;
his return. The quarters of Don Baithazar might have been&#xD;
half a mile from those of Philip; but the latter tobk horse to&#xD;
compass the interval. lie went in armor also. Such was the&#xD;
practice; and, in seasons of excitement, and with doubtful friends&#xD;
around them, such was the proper policy. But Philip was not&#xD;
at his ease. His instincts taught him to dread treachery. He&#xD;
knew Don Balthazar too well to put faith in his smooth accents.&#xD;
He knew that the latter must hate, and would strive to destroy&#xD;
him. Juan, the page, had like instincts, and an even better&#xD;
knowledge of the man than had his master. He plucked the&#xD;
knight by his sleeve, and whispered-&#xD;
"Beware, Seflor :-this summons-this man&#xD;
Philip laid his hand gently on the boy's mouth, and said, also in&#xD;
a whisper-&#xD;
"The good knight must be bold, ~Juan, and being so,~ m~ust al-&#xD;
ways beware that he is not too bold. But to caution him at one&#xD;
ur of a danger which he must confront, by force of duty, at&#xD;
'il hours, is surely an idle lesson. Hear me, boy :-do thou&#xD;
beware that thouneglectest not the duty which I now assign thee.&#xD;
&#xD;
I have, for a long hile, meditated to give thee a solemn charge,&#xD;
in anticipation of his danger of death which walks ever, side by&#xD;
side, with the sol ier. There are three letters, sealed with my&#xD;
signet, and fAde in silk, which you will find in the little lea-&#xD;
them case with w ich I travel. When I have left thee to-night,&#xD;
detach them from this case, and take them into thy own keeping.&#xD;
They are address , one of them, to my mother, in Portugal&#xD;
another to my brother Andres; and a third to a lady of the&#xD;
island of Cuba, whose name-but thou wilt read it on the&#xD;
missive. These t ou shalt, if thou survives me, in good faith&#xD;
deliver. All oth papers in the case shalt thou this very night&#xD;
destroy, as soon a I have left thee, and thou find'st thyself alone.&#xD;
Swear to me, boy on the Holy Cross, that thou wilt do these&#xD;
things which I hay bidden !"&#xD;
The knight held up the cross hinted sword as he spoke, and the&#xD;
boy, with a convu sive emotion, seized and kissed it. Then, with&#xD;
a sob, he cried-&#xD;
"Oh! Senior D n Philip, suffer that I follow thee now-that&#xD;
I go with thee to his meeting with thy enemy."&#xD;
"Not so: but will send thee word how and when to follow,&#xD;
should I not retur before noon to-morrow. For this night, boy,&#xD;
farewell !"&#xD;
And he laid h s hand gently on Juan's shoulder, and turned&#xD;
off a moment aft r. But the boy caught the hand quickly in&#xD;
his grasp, pressed it fervently in both of his own, then released&#xD;
it, and turned a / ay. The knight looked at the Moor with al-&#xD;
most loving eyes.&#xD;
"Verily," he murmured to himself-" verily, this boy hath a&#xD;
noble heart and ~oul, and he is very loving; and with ~ucli a&#xD;
depth of feeling a is seldom witnessed at his years. Where&#xD;
the heart growth ~o fast, and drinks in so much, it is rarely&#xD;
destined for long ife. Life lingers only with the hard, and the&#xD;
cold, and those wh are economical with the affections. The cold&#xD;
toad, it is said, re aineth-it cannot be said that he liveth-for&#xD;
a full thousand ye rs, locked up in stone."&#xD;
Thus musing, t e knight left the lodge, and joined the young&#xD;
Lieutenant who hr ught the message from Don Balthazar, and&#xD;
who awaited him a the entrance. They mounted horse instantly,&#xD;
and went towards he village; but scarcely had they entered the&#xD;
narrow streets, wh n Vasconselos found himself surrounded by a&#xD;
score or two of h se, from the centre of whom advanced a Cap-&#xD;
tain, who said, in tern accents-&#xD;
"Seflor Don hilip de Vasconselos, some time of Elvas in&#xD;

the King of Spain, &amp;amp;c., I arrest thee, by orders of his Excel.&#xD;
lency, Don Hernando de Soto, Governor of Cuba, and Adelan.&#xD;
tado of Florida, under a charge of High Treason. Yield thy&#xD;
sword!" !" exclaimed Don Philip indignantly. "Treason!&#xD;
Where is my accuser ?"&#xD;
"Thou shalt see and hear all in clue season! At present, I&#xD;
am commanded to bring thee, without speech with any one, to&#xD;
the presence of the Adelantado."&#xD;
Resistance,-even if Don Philip had been disposed to offer&#xD;
any-would have been perfectly idle. He submitted with quiet&#xD;
dignity.&#xD;
"Be it so !" he answered, quietly yielding his sword-." con-&#xD;
duct me to the Adelantado."&#xD;
The party set off that very instant. The knight of Portugal&#xD;
did not once see Don Balthazar until they met in the presence&#xD;
of De Soto. The wily spider had only waited to see Vascon-&#xD;
selos fairly in the clutches of the party placed in waiting for his&#xD;
arrest, when he set off; with another party o1~' horse, bringing up&#xD;
the rear, and watchful that the captive should find no means of&#xD;
escape.&#xD;
It was nearly noon of the next day when they reached the&#xD;
army. It was encamped on a pleasant plain, overshadowed&#xD;
every where with great trees of the forest. De Soto, with pride&#xD;
and passion equally roused, was impatiently waiting for the&#xD;
arrival of the offender. No delay was allowed him; and the pre-&#xD;
paration for his trial had been made before he came. A rude&#xD;
scaffolding, upon which the chair of state had been placed in&#xD;
readiness, had been raised for the Adelantado. His chief knights&#xD;
were grouped immediately around him. The troops, horse and&#xD;
foot, including the parties just arrived,-all under arms,-were&#xD;
dispersed so as to form ~a half-circle about the dais, in which&#xD;
every thing ~could be heard and seen by the meanest soldier.&#xD;
There they stood, in grim array, with burnished weapons, in&#xD;
mail and -escaupil, banner and banneret flying, and the gorgeous&#xD;
flag of Spain floating in the midst. De Soto was not the person&#xD;
to omit any of the blazonry and pageantry, the state and cere-&#xD;
monial, which belonged to his authority. Seated in his chair of&#xD;
state, surrounded by his knights, he ordered that the prisoner&#xD;
should be brought before him.&#xD;
Philip de Yasconselos, conducted by his guards into the circle,&#xD;
~ibated nothing of his dignity or noble firmness, as he stood be-&#xD;
fore the presence in which he could see none but enemies. He&#xD;
looked around for the few persons whose sympathies and sum&#xD;
&#xD;
TR13~A8O~                    487&#xD;
port he might hav~3 hoped for, had they been at hand. Where&#xD;
wa~ Nuno de Tob~ir at that moment ~ Where was his brother,&#xD;
Andres ~ In thei~ absence, he readily divined that no precau-&#xD;
tions had been onclitted by his enemies, for effecting their object.&#xD;
lie si~W that his clkom was written.&#xD;
This conviction, which threw him so completely upon God and&#xD;
his own soul, rais A him, with a strength of will and character, to&#xD;
face the event, w atever it might be.&#xD;
"I am here, nder bonds, as a criminal, Don Hernan de&#xD;
Soto," spoke Phil p, in clear, manly tones, his eye fixed brightly&#xD;
the while upon th face of the Adelantado :-~-" I demand to know&#xD;
of what I am acc sed, and that my accuser shall be set before&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"Thou shalt ave thy wish, Philip de Vasconselos. The&#xD;
charge against the is that of high treason to His Catholic Majesty,&#xD;
with whom thou hast taken service.~~&#xD;
"I brand the c arge with falsehood. I am no traitor."&#xD;
"That ~hall we see. Thou shalt behold and see thy accusers,&#xD;
and the ~itnesseS shall be brought before thee who shall prove&#xD;
thy offen~e."&#xD;
Vascoi~selos f lded his arms patiently, a d looked coldly&#xD;
around t~ie asse bly, while Hernan de S to, who did not&#xD;
think amiss of hi own eloquence, descanted in a sort of general&#xD;
speech upon the affairs and necessities of the army; the duties&#xD;
of a good knight, and faithful~ubject; the hig trusts and con-&#xD;
fidence which ha been given to the knight of ortugal, and the&#xD;
imperative neces ity for condign punishment, erever trusts had&#xD;
been forfeited, ai the trusted person had sho n himself unfaith-&#xD;
ful. Philip smil d scornfully, in a bitter moo , as he listened to&#xD;
certain portions f the speech; and the cheek of De Soto red-&#xD;
dened as he notic d the expression. His cons ience smote him,&#xD;
though not suffi iently, when he reflected u on the notorious&#xD;
slight to which t e knight of Portugal had be n subjected from&#xD;

"Thou art c arged, Philip de Yasconse os, by the noble&#xD;
Senior, Don Bal hazar de Alvaro, with havin betrayed to the&#xD;
Princess of Cof chiqui the secret councils f the conference,&#xD;
when thou wast resent as a member, and wI n it was resolved&#xD;
that the safety ~ the army required that w should take that&#xD;

"It is true that I did so endeavor to persuade the Princess&#xD;
Co~alla to escape, and in this was I faithful to my oath of chival.&#xD;
ry. I were no true knight to have kept silence, when so gross a&#xD;
wrong was meditated against that gentle and lovely young Prin.&#xD;
cess. But the council knew my sentiments in reference to that&#xD;
measure. I did not conceal what I thought, that it was a Iase-&#xD;
ness which would forever dishonor the Spanish name."&#xD;
"That gave thee no right to betray the councils to which thou&#xD;
wert admitted on the implied condition of thy secrecy. Thy&#xD;
pledged to us- an&#xD;
faith wa             ,  d the crime, if crime there were, fell&#xD;
upon our heads, not thine. Thou hast admitted the charge, which&#xD;
we should ele establish against thee by no less than three repu-&#xD;
table witnesses."&#xD;
"It is admitted," said the knight.&#xD;
"It is next charged that thou didst recently set upon the two&#xD;
soldiers appointed for the safe keeping of the prilicess, didst as-&#xD;
sault them wi1th naked, weapons, didst wound one of them, and&#xD;
put in mortal fear the other, and didst succeed in wresting this&#xD;
princess from their keeping, so that she has made full escape from&#xD;
our care and custody, thus depriving this army of all the benefits&#xD;
which grew naturally out of our charge of her person.~~&#xD;
"I found the two ruffianly soldiers to whom the princess had&#xD;
been confided, setting upon her with brutal violence and foul pur-&#xD;
pose, and as true knight and gentleman, I did so rescue her from&#xD;
their keeping. I had no purpose~ this, but the safety and inno-&#xD;
cence of the noble woman."&#xD;
The two soldiers were brought forward, and loudly protested&#xD;
their innocence, making affirmation'on the Holy Evangel.&#xD;
~' Thou hear'st ?" said De Soto.&#xD;
"1 hear, SeAor. Is it Ijo be allowed to these wretches, thus&#xD;
charged with a heinous cri r4 e, to acquit themselves by their own&#xD;
asseverations ~"&#xD;
"It is thy offence, Sefior, and not theirs, which is now before&#xD;
this tribunal." Such was t1~e interposition of Don Balthazar.&#xD;
"And it is in answer to tI~e charge against me, that I do accuse&#xD;
these ruffians and acquit myself."&#xD;
"Were such privilege a~varded to the criminal, there would&#xD;
be no witness to be found innocent," replied De Soto. "Thou&#xD;
dost not deny the rescue of the princess from her keepers '?"&#xD;
" I glory in the act too greatly to deny it," was the answer.&#xD;
am proud of the i~ioble service."&#xD;
" ila! We shall see how far thy exultation in the deed will&#xD;
suffice to acquit thee ~f its penalties! Hear further:&#xD;

CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Take this life&#xD;
And cancel these cold bonds.'&#xD;
cY~EBEUKL&#xD;
THERE was a. markedd and lively sensation throughout the&#xD;
assembly. The savage and mercenary soldiers of that day were&#xD;
not wholly insensi~Ae to the courage of a truly noble soul, and,&#xD;
little loving, as tl~ey were, of the foreigners who had mortified&#xD;
their pride, on sucti frequent occasions, the Castilians were coin.&#xD;
polled to acknowledge how admirable, calm, fearless and chival.&#xD;
rous was the wholc~ bearing of Philip de Vasconselos.&#xD;
But Don Baltha~ar did. not lift the glove. There might have&#xD;
been seen a red sikifusion coloring suddenly his swarthy cheeks&#xD;
as he heard the epithets applied by the knight of Portugal; but,&#xD;
otherwise, he was apparently unmoved. He answered with a&#xD;
coQl and quiet indifference, which betrayed the long and hard&#xD;
training of his political life.&#xD;
"Nay, Sefor, thy glove is no longer such as an honorable&#xD;
knight and gentle~nan may lift without stain upon his fingers.&#xD;
Thou hast not the r~ght to claim the ordeal of battle. This would&#xD;
be thy right were I ~he accuser, and the only witness against thee!&#xD;
Then mightst ~thou claim to put thy body as thy word against&#xD;
mine, and cry upor~ God to defend the right! But such is not&#xD;
now the case. Thy crimes, partially confessed by thyseli are&#xD;
also proven by st~ndry Christian witnesses, sworn on Holy&#xD;
Evangel. I claim the judgment, your Excellency, ".-turning&#xD;
to De Soto,-" upo~i the arch traitor, Philip de Vasconselos, who&#xD;
hath betrayed the ~ounsels and the trusts of His Most Catholic&#xD;
Majesty, given him~in keeping, and hath meditated and devised&#xD;
still further treason~, as hath been shown by sworn witnesses.&#xD;
I claim the judgme~it upon the said traitor, and that he be done&#xD;
to death without delay !"&#xD;
There was a momx~entary start,-a slight recoil on the part of&#xD;
Vasconselos, as he heard the words. It is barely possible that he&#xD;
had not apprehende4l that the malice of his enemies would attain&#xD;
to this extremity; but, if his emotion expressed surprise, it was&#xD;
without fear. He looked on and listened~ without other show of&#xD;
emotion.&#xD;

evitable fate, always wears an aspect of great nobleness. When&#xD;
Philip de Vasconselos was led from the presence of the assembly,&#xD;
he was followed, on all sides, 'by glances of silent admiration and&#xD;
a compelled respects lie was withdrawn, by the guards, while&#xD;
the Adelantado and his council sate in private judgment on his&#xD;
fate. Long was the conference that followed. Do~i Balthazar&#xD;
strenuously urged the doom of death. But De Soto, filled with&#xD;
chivalrous notions, ~Vas not prepared to yield to the malignant&#xD;
suggestion. It is pc~ssible that he somewhat suspected that there&#xD;
was some truth in the charge of malignity and slander which&#xD;
Philip had brought against Don Balthazar. He had long been&#xD;
aware of the dislike which they mutually felt for each other. He&#xD;
said to the latter-&#xD;
"Verily, Don Ba1tl~azar, this knight of Portugal bath bitter&#xD;
thoughts of thee."&#xD;
"When had the criminal other thoughts- of him who declares&#xD;
his crime ?"&#xD;
"But I somewhat fear that thou hast&#xD;
uttermost."                         pushed this matter to the&#xD;
"Grant it be so, Sefior ;-there is enough, besides, in the con..&#xD;
fession which he made to suffice for his conviction."&#xD;
"True! True! He bath confessed to the betrayal of our&#xD;
purpose to the princess, and to the charge of assault upon our&#xD;
officers, and her rescue.&#xD;
"These are crimes worthy of death! This is treason! What&#xD;
had Cortez or Pizarro done to ~the knight, or knights, who had&#xD;
rescued Montezuma and the Inca from their guards, and set&#xD;
them free to work th~ ruin of the army and the enterprise ?"&#xD;
"They had been made to taste of the sharp edge of the axe!&#xD;
-.-----But I will not slay this knight of Portugal! He bath done us&#xD;
good service, and there is some rebuke of conscience that I feel,&#xD;
for his too much neglect, and for the cold aspect which I have&#xD;
shown him. Besides, I owe him a life. But for his succor I&#xD;
had probably perished under the savage assault of the fierce Flo-&#xD;
riclian, Vitachuco. I cannot forget these things. I will not take&#xD;
the life of this man !"&#xD;
"What! Wilt thoi~ forgive such treachery? Wilt thou suffer&#xD;

&#xD;
cause of that denial, and those words and looks of scorn! He&#xD;
arose, erect, and looked coldly on his judges. But there was a&#xD;
terrible glare from his eyes, which made all other eyes look aside!&#xD;
His lips were now compressed, but big drops of blood could be&#xD;
seen slowly to ooze from between them, and to form themselves&#xD;
m beads upon his beard. J4e stood, and for a few moments&#xD;
there was a deep pause in the assembly. Then, at a signal from&#xD;
De Soto, the executioner came forward with his assistants. They&#xD;
passed a halter about his neck. He offered no resistance. He&#xD;
did not even tuyn his glances upon them, when they laid hands&#xD;
upon his shoulder. But as they led him out, he looked steadily&#xD;
at De Soto, and said solemnly:&#xD;
"A Dios!"&#xD;
The words were not spoken by way of farewell. They were&#xD;
in the nature of a citation; and so De Soto understood them;&#xD;
and a sudden palene~s, the shadow of a presentiment, overspread&#xD;
hi~ face. But the emotion passed from his soul. The drums and&#xD;
trumpets sounded. The assembly was broken up, and the army,&#xD;
forming a grand procession, was marched~ at once to the place of&#xD;
execution.&#xD;
And there, the central object of that great array, stern, lofty,&#xD;
helpless, but resigned, stood the noble victim-resolute to sub..&#xD;
mit, but not wholly able to conceal the terrible emotions which&#xD;
racked his soul! There, bound by the degrading halter to the tree&#xD;
by the hands of the common executioner, he was subjected to all&#xD;
the details of the cruel and malignant judgment, as we have re-&#xD;
ported them. His sword was broken, his shield reversed, its&#xD;
blazonry obliterated, before his eyes! The armor was torn from&#xD;
his person, and battered with blows of a club; his helmet was&#xD;
hurled into a neighboring morass. 'And he saw and was silent,&#xD;
-looking the while steadily upon the Adelantado, with eyes of&#xD;
a deep mysterious solemnity, that spoke for dread and terrible&#xD;
thoughts, as well as sufferings!&#xD;
But when the executkner approached with his axe-when the&#xD;
prisoner was made to lift his feet and place them upon the block,&#xD;
and when, one by one, the golden spurs of knighthood were hewn&#xD;
from his heels by repeated blows, then broke .the groan of agony&#xD;
from his overcharged bosom, and he threw out his powerful arms&#xD;
and grasped the stalwart executioner, even as he had been an&#xD;
infant in his grasp, and hurled him away, staggering, while a howl,&#xD;
rather than a cry, following the groan, seemed sent up to heaven&#xD;
-by way of reproach, for that it looked on, and beheld this ter-&#xD;
rible injustice, while the great eye of the sun peered down from&#xD;
the noon-day skies, as bright and serene as if all below was as&#xD;

"Had they known,&#xD;
A. woman's hand secured that deed her own.&#xD;
The worst of crimes had left her woman stilI.'t~  -~&#xD;
CORSAIR.&#xD;
THE army of the Adelantado proceeded on its march along the&#xD;
waters of the Coosaw, but Don Balthazar ~e~Alvaro returned, with&#xD;
his detachment of cavalry, to the village of ~Dhiaha. To him was&#xD;
allotted the duty of bringing up the rear-guard, with the heavy&#xD;
baggage; and he was required to remain in Chiaha until the&#xD;
smaller bodies which had been sent forth on exploring expedi-&#xD;
tions, under Nunb de Tobar, Andres de Vasconselos and others,&#xD;
should return. Chiaha was the appointed place of their rendez-&#xD;
vous.&#xD;
There was an exulting spirit in the bosom of ~Don Balthazar,&#xD;
as he led his troopers away from the field where he had witness-&#xD;
ed the degradation of Philip de Vasconselos. lie had triumphed&#xD;
over his enemy; and there was now no danger that the knight&#xD;
of Portugal would ever cross his path in the progress of the&#xD;
expedition. The penalty of his return was death. Don Baltha-&#xD;
zar would have preferred that this punishment should have been&#xD;
the one inflicted. He did not, himself; attach much importance&#xD;
to what he thought the fantastic notions of honor and shame,&#xD;
which were taught by the laws of chivalry; and, were it not that&#xD;
the punishment of Don Philip implied his utter banishment from&#xD;
the army, and his almost certain death, in the condition in which&#xD;
he had been left, from the fierce fangs of the wild beast, or the&#xD;
reckless arrows of the savage, he might have been still ill at ease&#xD;
in respect to some of his securities. In truth, he still had some&#xD;
lurking apprehensions that Philip de Vasconselos was yet, in&#xD;
some way, his evil genius; destined yet to re-appear, and con-&#xD;
front him with that danger which had so long haunted his ima..&#xD;
gination! With this fear, it occurred to him, more than once,&#xD;
to send back one of his troopers to dispatch secretly the de-&#xD;
graded knight; but this was placing himself too completely in&#xD;
the power of his creature; and he well knew that such a fact,&#xD;
revealed to D~ Soto and the army, would be necessarily his own&#xD;

hands; then felt that all the letters were safe within his bosom,&#xD;
and experienced a strange and sudden dread lest the knight&#xD;
should resume the charge of them. There was one letter which&#xD;
he would not willingly give up,-the contents of which he dread-&#xD;
ed, yet desired to peruse.&#xD;
"It is he-it is Philip !" murmured the boy, recovering, and&#xD;
relieved of the apprehensions which had troubled him for the&#xD;
safety of the knight.- "It is* Philip !" and he hastily undid the&#xD;
fastenings of the entrance. The horseman threw himself off the&#xD;
saddle at this m&#xD;
cottage.        oment, and hastily pushed his way into the&#xD;
"Sefior 1', said the pa.ge, somewhat taken by surprise at .the&#xD;
manner and hurried movement of the knight, so unlike that of&#xD;
Vasconselos. "Sefior Philip !" he said, timidly and inquiringly.&#xD;
"Not he, my good lad, but one quite as good, I fancy !" an-&#xD;
swered the stranger, grasping the boy's wrist and dragging him&#xD;
towards the light. In the next moment, Juan identified the per-&#xD;
son of the intruder. To recoil was an involuntary act, as he&#xD;
exclai~ned-..&#xD;
"Don Baithazar !"&#xD;
"Ay, methinks, my good boy, I should be as well known to&#xD;
thee by this time as the cavalier whom thou serves. But why&#xD;
dost thou recoil? Dost thou fear me&#xD;
"No, Seflor, but&#xD;
It was with very great effort that the boy was enabled to say&#xD;
these latter words, which he did with husky and tremulous ac-&#xD;
cents, the sounds~ dying away in his throat.&#xD;
"Ay, but thon dost. Yet thou shouldst not. llenc~forth,&#xD;
thou shalt look upon me as thy best friend and protector, since&#xD;
thy late master can take care of thee no longer."&#xD;

I' Nay, but a little towards it. I but sped the progress, and&#xD;
nodded to the judgment, and smiled on the execution. I put the&#xD;
arrow on the string and found the mark. 'Twas De Soto that&#xD;
sped it from the bow !"&#xD;
The boy clasped his hands wildly together. The knight began&#xD;
to sing a vulgar ballad then current in the army. There was&#xD;
something very fearful in the strong glance which the page set&#xD;
upon the face of the singer, whose every look and tone betrayed&#xD;
the full consciousness of his triumph. He stooped, while sing.&#xD;
ing, and threw fresh brands upon the fire. Juan suddenly darted&#xD;
away as if to pass him; but the knight was not unobservant,&#xD;
caught him by the arm, as he went forward, and whirled him&#xD;
back to the corner of the chamber beyond him.&#xD;
"No! no! thou dost not cease to be page, boy, in the loss of&#xD;
one master! One but makes way for another; and I am instead&#xD;
of thy Philip; with all his rights and privileges, my sweet Moor.&#xD;
But thou shalt lose none of thine in becoming page to me. Oh!&#xD;
no! thou shalt share my lodge, my couch, an thou wilt, for my&#xD;
taste revolts not at thy dusky visage, when the features are so&#xD;
fine, and the good faith of the owner so perfect. Thou art mine,&#xD;
now, my boy !"&#xD;
"Seilor! I must go and peek Don Philip !" was the calmly&#xD;
expressed resolution of the boy.&#xD;
"Thou wouldst 'go in vain. Thou wouldst find his bones only.&#xD;
He hath given rare picking to the panther."&#xD;
"Seftor, I must go I"&#xD;
"Stay where thou art !"&#xD;
"If thou hast compassion in thy soul---.----"&#xD;
"Pshaw! I know not such folly."&#xD;
"As a knight, thou know'st it is my duty to seek my lord."&#xD;
"Not when he is dishonored, boy! Henceforth, I am thy&#xD;
knight, I tell thee! Thy master-in whose hands thy life lies,&#xD;
even as an egg, which I can crush to atoms with a will! What!&#xD;
thou pre~endest that thou know'st me not! Thou wouldst not&#xD;
admit to thyself that I know thee! Does thy imposture~ tickle&#xD;
thee so much, that thou art resolute not to see and believe ?"&#xD;
The page, indeed, had seen but too well! Yet he was reso.&#xD;
lute, as Don Balthazar had said, not to see! It was still possible&#xD;
-so he persuaded himself-that his persecutor spoke from his&#xD;
drunkenness, rather than his knowledge ;-and that his ~ecrct,-&#xD;
for he had one-was still unsuspected, or, at least, unknown.&#xD;
He answered accordingly, with as much calmness of temper as he&#xD;
could command.         K&#xD;

&#xD;
need thou put on the airs of thy Biscayan mother with me now!&#xD;
We have no such restraints here, as restrained our raptures and&#xD;
made us fearful in Havana. Here, there is something more than&#xD;
freedom! Thou know'st the license of the army. Thou hast&#xD;
seen that it could not save a princess of the people. Suppose it&#xD;
said to the soldiers, This blackamoor page is the girl whom&#xD;
Philip de Vasconselos entertained par amour-.and what will fob&#xD;
low'? I tell thee, girl, in very love of thee, they will tear one&#xD;
another to pieces, and tear thy delicate limbs to pieces also! Art&#xD;
thou wise to see this, and to understand how much better it will&#xD;
be, still to keep thy secret, and to serve me as a page, even as&#xD;
thou hast served this knight of Portugal ?"&#xD;
For a time, a strongg despair sate in the eyes of Olivia. But&#xD;
she gathered strength and comparative composure, while he&#xD;
was speaking, and when he was done, she said with closed lips&#xD;
and teeth,-&#xD;
"I will perish first !"&#xD;
"Nay, nay, thou shalt not perish! I have done too much to K&#xD;
secure thee in my keeping to lose thee now; when I have at last&#xD;
sfi~curely won thee. I have pursued this knight of Portugal, until&#xD;
I destroyed him, because he knew the secret of thy shame and&#xD;
n~y dishonor! He is no longer a danger to either of us.-And&#xD;
thou art won! We are here, alone-in the deep midnight,--&#xD;
with no eye to see, no hand to rescue thee from my grasp,-and,&#xD;
with the treasure thus won,-..and the precious beauty thus in my&#xD;
embrace,-shall I now recoil from my possessions ?-shall I&#xD;
withdraw my claim, and abandon the very bliss for which I have&#xD;
toiled in such secret ways, and perilled so many open dangers'?&#xD;
No, my Olivia, thou art now mine, more certainly than ever. It&#xD;
needs now no subtle opiate to subdue thy senses. It needs now&#xD;
no future watchful anxiety, to watch the paths, and dread ever&#xD;
more the danger and detection! Here, we have perfect freedom.&#xD;
Life means privilege, to take and keep I W~ have no laws but&#xD;
such as justify the passions; and just now, the passions are the&#xD;
only laws that require to be obeyed. Thou art mine, girl,-&#xD;
mine, Olivia,-and I seize thee with a rapture, which, sweet as&#xD;
thy embrace hath been of yore, promises now a blessing as far&#xD;
beyond the past, as the joys of heaven are claimed to be beyond&#xD;
those of earth! Wilt thou be mine, and submit to be my wil.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
"Now shall we pluck him from his wretched plight,&#xD;
And make misfortune favor."        Ow PrAY&#xD;
THE arPny of De Soto marched down the west side of the&#xD;
~oosa, and were soon buried deeply in the virgin wildernesses&#xD;
of Alabama. They gave but few thoughts to the noble victim&#xD;
whom they had dishonored and left to perish in the ravening&#xD;
solitudes of the forest. To him, the short remnant of the day&#xD;
passed in such a dreariness as may better be imagined than de-&#xD;
scribed. Fettered rigidly to the tree, at the foot of which he was&#xD;
barely suffered to repose in a half-crouching position, Vasconselos&#xD;
was scarcely conscious of the hours as they glided from daylight&#xD;
into darkness. A savage gloom covered up his soul, and shut&#xD;
out the ordinary transitions and aspects of external life from his&#xD;
vision. In the case of one so noble of soul, so proud of spirit, so&#xD;
sensitive to shame and honor, we may fancy how terribly intense&#xD;
were the horrors of such a doom as that which he h~d been made&#xD;
to endure. We may equally understand how regardless he had&#xD;
become in respect to the future, from his endurance of the past.&#xD;
The day passed blankly,. before his eyes; the st~rrs caine out,&#xD;
looking down upon him with sad aspects through ~he overhang-&#xD;
ing boughs of the forest trees, with like blankness of expression.&#xD;
He heeded not, he did not behold the tender brightness in their&#xD;
looks. He lay crouching, a grim savage, denied the only prayer&#xD;
which his soul~ could possibly put up in that dreary trial, that of&#xD;
a manly death, through a fierce and terrible struggle with his&#xD;
enemies.&#xD;
And so, hour after hour, in a hopeless craving for freedom of&#xD;
limb, and the exercise of a mighty muscle in the deadly strife!&#xD;
and.the hopeless craving became at length debility. Mental and&#xD;
~phy~ical exhaustion began to supervene. He became conscious&#xD;
of aspects and influences which taught to his waning faculties the&#xD;
fear 9f approaching madness. He was conscious~ of an incerti-&#xD;
tude of thought and sense, which was the most oppressive of all&#xD;
the painful feelings which he now endured. He felt that his&#xD;
senses were escaping him, or becoming so diseasedly acute as to&#xD;
confound his judgment. He felt that he could no longer bring&#xD;

&#xD;
And the wild savage of the woods,-the most savage, perhaps,&#xD;
in all the forests of America, the panther, encircled the sleeping&#xD;
man; and he stooped his nose to the unconscious ears; and there&#xD;
was a faint murmur of speech from the l~ps of the knight; and&#xD;
once more the panther retired into his thicket, and the great&#xD;
vulture, again dropped from the tree-top td the ground. And he,&#xD;
to~ encircled the sleeper. And once more he spread his great&#xD;
wings above his head, and he fanned slowly the drowsy air about&#xD;
him: then Jie sounded a fiei'ce wild note-a great shriek through&#xD;
the forest-and the sleeper stirred slightly with a lifted arm;&#xD;
and the vulture resumed the fanning with his wings. But soon&#xD;
another shriek from the depths of the night was heard in answer&#xD;
to the signal of the watchful bird; and another followed after it.&#xD;
And ere many moments there was a family group of the raven.&#xD;
ous birds about their victim, and each spread forth his wings,&#xD;
* beating slowly the drowsy atmosphere, and drawing nigher mo-&#xD;
mently until they stood about the head and breast of the un~on-&#xD;
scious knight, like so many hooded priests about the corse of&#xD;
a brother. And still it seemed as if the knight were not uncon-&#xD;
scious, though unable. A murmur broke from his lips, and ever&#xD;
and anon his arm was thrown up spasmodically, but only to fall&#xD;
supine upon the earth beside him.&#xD;
Again was the child-like cry heard in the forest, and the savage&#xD;
panther once more issi~ied from its depths, stealthily as the cat,&#xD;
passing along timorously beside the edge of the wood, and pur-&#xD;
suing a circling course towards his victim; and this time he came&#xD;
not alone. He was accompanied by his more savage mate, fol-&#xD;
lowed by her cubs, and they drew near, whining as they did so,&#xD;
like kittens that a~~e beckoned to their food. The obscene birds&#xD;
angrily flapped their wings and shrieked a~ their approach; but&#xD;
still retreated, and once more lifted themselves upon slow&#xD;
pinions to- the trees above, where they looked down, watching&#xD;
the common prey, and waiting for their moment with iinpa-&#xD;
tience.&#xD;
Now, could we see clearly the condition of the exhausted&#xD;
cavalier, we should behold him covered wiiih a cold and clammy&#xD;
sweat, the proof that there was still a lur~dng consciousness, a&#xD;
faculty of life, which, though lacking every essential capacity for&#xD;
struggle and defence, was yet not wanting in the cutest sensi-&#xD;
bilities of horror. Again was there a feeble murmur of speech&#xD;
from his pallid lips, and again were his nerveless arms stirred, but&#xD;
this time uxiiifted, as if striving to defy or to drive away the assail-&#xD;
ant.&#xD;
He was not thus to be expelled. Heedless of the murm m'~&#xD;

perhaps without his own consciousness-acquired all those&#xD;
ral laws of travel which the wayfarer in the great forest&#xD;
hardly forbear to learn. But to these he made: no referee&#xD;
the present progress. His lessons came t? him through&#xD;
pulses. They served him as instincts. In ~he ordinary pro&#xD;
of thought and induction, he certainly c~id not once it&#xD;
during the long, wild, but well-directed flight, in which we&#xD;
trace his course.&#xD;
He dashed headlong through the village of Chiaha, whei'&#xD;
command of Don Balthazar was still quartered. Little di&#xD;
cavaliers dream of the bloody fate of their superior. TI&#xD;
gitive was challenged by the sentry as he entered one&#xD;
sylvan avenues, and again challenged as he hurried throu~&#xD;
opposite end into the wilderness again. He heard not t]&#xD;
mand-he made no answer to the summons, and the mat&#xD;
was emptied at him as he flew, and he knew not that h&#xD;
escaped any danger. The great thickets ohee more recciv&#xD;
with such shelter as they afford. The dim lights of heave~&#xD;
fice for the steed, but he sees nothing, nor is he conscio&#xD;
any lack of light. If he does not reason, he is yet not&#xD;
lightened by aspects that sufficiently fill his mind. Even&#xD;
speeds, he sees, still receding as he approaches, yet still&#xD;
spicuously distinct before his eyes, the great encampment c&#xD;
Soto-the amphitheatre of trees and tents, and grouped 501&#xD;
surrounding and grim warriors presiding in judgment, and a&#xD;
executioner with bloody axe~prominent over all, and in the~&#xD;
a noble form, about to sink !-and he cries hoarsely as he&#xD;
the steed-hoarsely and feebly,-his voice subsiding to a&#xD;
per-&#xD;
"But one moment, Philip-but one moment-and I am&#xD;

which he alone could arrest-that not a moment was to be 1&#xD;

THE MAD FLIGHT.                  463&#xD;
den-fortunately a light one-resuming a fi ght which, for five&#xD;
hours, had known no cessation. In this flight the rider had no&#xD;
terrors-no consciousness of any danger. T e beast had many.&#xD;
Sometimes he shyod from the track; ~ hile eve y limb shook with&#xD;
emotion. His keen scent had caught the wind borne to him from&#xD;
the lairs of the wolf and panther. They, too might have been&#xD;
upon his track; doubtless were,-but that his flu ht had been ~o fast&#xD;
and far, and that he seemed to their eyes t carry on his back&#xD;
a wild terror, with eyes of madness, much mo e fearful than their&#xD;
own. Of such as these the fugitive never th ught. But, when&#xD;
the steed swerved aside, he irked him with s ur or -dagger,----in-&#xD;
dignant-crying out in shrillest tones-.~" Beas ! we have not a&#xD;
moment to lose. See you not they hasten! ah! Philip, but a&#xD;
moment more! But a moment !"&#xD;
And with every word there was rowel stroke, or dagger&#xD;
thrust, till the flanks and neck of the steed yore clammy with&#xD;
the red blood oozing forth.&#xD;
And while the eyes of the rider stared out~ dilating, wild and&#xD;
red, into the infinite space and vacancy-fii~ ed only with con-&#xD;
fused and dreadful aspects to his gaze-the daly suddenly opened&#xD;
the great portals of the world, and the steed Went forward with&#xD;
more confidence; but Juan saw not a whit i~ore than had been&#xD;
quite as apparent to him all the night. Nat, he saw less, for&#xD;
night and darkness, and the solitude, had bee~ favorable to the&#xD;
creation of such illusions as had occupied his md, and the glare&#xD;
of day, and the sounds and sights of waking a Tid creeping things,&#xD;
did somewhat conflict with the mental power o create and make&#xD;
its own individual impressions.&#xD;
It was a dreadful ride, like that of Leono~a and the Fiend&#xD;
Lover, in the weird and fantastic legend of Bi~rger. And, if the&#xD;
dead lover accompanied not our filfgitive, ther~ were yet terrible&#xD;
aspects that rode beside, and fearful cries followed on the wind,&#xD;
while ever ana anon the voice of Don Balth~zar thrilled in the&#xD;
ears of the page, crying, "Back, you are mhie! You are too&#xD;
late !"&#xD;
Then would the fugitive set his teeth closely tether, and&#xD;
clutch his dagger with determined gripe, amjl hiss through his&#xD;
shut lips-" What! you have not had enough?1 You would taste&#xD;
again, would you !"&#xD;
And so muttering, he would behold. the amphitheatre once&#xD;
more, wherein Do Soto's knights and soldiers e vironod the noble&#xD;
victim; and so seeing, the* boy would set on, with driving spur&#xD;
anew, repeating his hoarse whisper in. his throa The while-" Bpt&#xD;

The day dawned, and the horse sped over a beaten&#xD;
He was in the very route pursued the day before, when&#xD;
Baithazar returned triumphant after the degradation of&#xD;
my-returned, as he fancied, to delights, and the safe rene&#xD;
criminal but intoxicating pleasures, never once dreaming&#xD;
Fate stood with open arms welcoming him to the bloodied&#xD;
brace.&#xD;
The steed of our page felt himself sure at every step.&#xD;
track was readily apparent. He went forward more confi&#xD;
and more cheerfully-, but with less rapidity, for now it wa&#xD;
the rider began to feel the gradual exhaustion of' that str&#xD;
which had been too severely taxed by such a progress.&#xD;
page was no longer conscious of the diminished speed of th&#xD;
mal. His own growing feebleness reconciled him to the&#xD;
sluggish pace of the beast. But ever and anon he would&#xD;
out of his stupor with a sort of cry, and using the rowel,&#xD;
expostulate-" Would you stop now, beast, when we ar&#xD;
the spot? What, do you not hear him call to me? You kno&#xD;
voice. Hear! He says-ah! what does he say! But I&#xD;
1 know. Wait but a moment, Sei'ior,-but a moment-&#xD;
moment !"&#xD;
And the bridle grasp would relax,-and the form would&#xD;
to turn in the saddle,-while the eyes would close for a whi&#xD;
open anew, only at the sudden short stopping of the hor&#xD;
graze along the wayside. Then would the rider show a mo&#xD;
anger, and send him forward anew with prick of dagger, and&#xD;
ter as before-the poor beast submitting, with the wanted&#xD;
ity. of the well-trained war-horse, pursuing meekly the b&#xD;
track until he stood-coming to a full halt-on the very gr&#xD;
where De Soto's encampment had been made.&#xD;
Then the page opened his eyes, and was about to smit~&#xD;
beast and goad him forward-when the rude scaffolding ~&#xD;
the Adelantado had made his dais-on which had stooc&#xD;
Chair of State, and where he had delivered judgment-be&#xD;
suddenly apparent to his glance. With a sudden shriek a&#xD;
beheld, the boy stretched out his hands and plunged forward:&#xD;
ing heavily upon the ground, with a sad murmur-&#xD;
"It is too late! too late!"&#xD;
He swooned away; while the horse, stepping carefully I&#xD;
ward, wandered. oW in search of water. And, for an hour&#xD;
beast wandered thus from side to side. He found streams in ~&#xD;

he slaked his thirst. He found tender. grasses in the shady&#xD;
woods, which he cropped at leisure. And the day thus wore on.&#xD;
The animal now began to be a ]ittle restive and he whinnied for&#xD;
companionship, looking round, from side to side, for some one&#xD;
to approach, and strip off his furniture, and show that solicitude&#xD;
for him to which he had been accustomed, and which the beast&#xD;
craves no less than his master.&#xD;
His whinny made its way to other ears than those of his late&#xD;
rider. The page still lay insensible, in the shadow of a great&#xD;
tree; nature thus seeking relief from the sufferings which it had&#xD;
undergone, and obtaining respite from the fiery stress of thought&#xD;
upon the brain. Soon, a figure emerged from the thicket, stealth-&#xD;
ily approaching the spot where the horse had again begun to&#xD;
feed. The stranger was one of the red men, a subject of the&#xD;
Cassique of Chiaha. He was followed by two others, one of whom&#xD;
was a woman. The leader of the party made his way towards&#xD;
the steed, observing the while the greatest precaution. To the&#xD;
red mei~ the horse was still an object of terror. He had been&#xD;
wont, at first, to confound him with his rider. He had thus per-&#xD;
fectly conceived the idea of the ancients of the East, to whom we&#xD;
owe the classical monster, the Centaur. Disabused by expe-&#xD;
rience of this error, he did not yet divest the horse of all those&#xD;
powers which really belonged to his rider, lie fancied still that&#xD;
fire issued froig his nostrils. He did not doubt that his teeth&#xD;
were quite as~ fearful as those of the tiger or the wolf. It re-&#xD;
quired, accordingly, no small degree of courage to approach the&#xD;
monster of which so little w~s known, and of whose powers so&#xD;
much was erroneously thought. But one red man did approach;&#xD;
the horse seeming so innocent-so gentle and subdued-so quiet..&#xD;
ly grazing, and altogether inviting approach by the general do-&#xD;
cility of his air and behaviour. The grasp of the forest hunter&#xD;
was at length fairly laid upon the bridle of the steed, and he was&#xD;
a captive.&#xD;
The red man laughed out with delight. He called his com-&#xD;
rades to him, and they approached with trembling. He grew&#xD;
bolder as he beheld their fears.. He encouraged them. He&#xD;
stroked the neck and mane of the beast, who seemed grateful&#xD;
and submissive, and they all laughed. And they chattered&#xD;
among themselves like parrots; until made bolder as he became&#xD;
familiar, and as the animal continued to crop the grass, showing&#xD;
himself quite passive, the captor leapt upon his back, and crept&#xD;
forward to the saddle, and wreathed his hand in the mane, having&#xD;
abandoned his grasp of the bridle, of the use of which he had no&#xD;
notion. Pleased with his elevation, the savage persuaded his&#xD;

comrades to follow him, and his brother warrior leapt ,then&#xD;
the squaw followed, and as the horse moved slowly fron~ side to&#xD;
side, cropping the grass, and seemingly heedless of his urden,&#xD;
but still walking, the simple savages clapped their hai s and&#xD;
yelled with delight.&#xD;
But that yell' awakened the destrier to new sensation The&#xD;
beast knew that he was in the power of his enemies. H char-&#xD;
acter changed on the instant. His moods, his pa~sioims, re all&#xD;
stirred with excitement. He threw head and tail alo . He&#xD;
shook out his mane; the blood of the war-horse was aro sed as&#xD;
with the shrill summons of the clarion, and he dashed a ay at&#xD;
headlong 'speed, to seek the spot where he had left his aster.&#xD;
At the first bound be shook himself free of the squaw, wh rolled&#xD;
away over his haunches, suffering nq hurt but a prodigious right,&#xD;
as she settled down in a heap upoi~ the earth, hardly k owing&#xD;
whether she was dead or alive. The Indians yelled agai with&#xD;
sudden terror; and the shrill cry increased the speed of t e ard-&#xD;
mal. Away he dashed with the headlong rapidity of a argc.&#xD;
The foremost of the savages clung to hi~ back like a cat, w ile he&#xD;
wound his hands more firmly' within ~e animal's mane. The&#xD;
other clung to the body of his comrade. Then the animal hrew&#xD;
his head down, and both of them went over his neck. They&#xD;
rolled away, on opposite 'sides, quite unhurt, but h ribly&#xD;
alarmed. The steed flew, as he felt relieved of his burde , and&#xD;
he was quickly out of sight.&#xD;
The two savages lay for several minutes upon the ear , not&#xD;
daring to look up or speak. But as the sounds of the rse's&#xD;
feet grew more distant, one of them rose to a sitting p ture.&#xD;
He called to the other in under tones.' It required some t ught&#xD;
and examination to be assured of the fact that both of the still&#xD;
lived, and that no bones were broken. One of them wen back&#xD;
for the squaw. She, too, was unhurt. They were soon bm ught&#xD;
together, and a rapid consultation determined them to rsue&#xD;
the monster who had treated them with so much, mdi nity.&#xD;
Bows were~bent, arrows got in readiness, the stone hatch' was&#xD;
seized in sinewy grasp, and the two warriors went forward the&#xD;
woman following at a little distance, and trembling for the vent.&#xD;
It was a matter of course that the red men should fast n in-&#xD;
stantly upon the fresh track of the horse, and follow it with&#xD;
unerring certainty. The beast, meanwhile, had made hi way&#xD;
back to where the page had fallen, and when the pursuers ' rew&#xD;
nigh they found him smelling at the hands of his late, ride and&#xD;
pushing them with his nose. The boy was stirring sli htly.&#xD;
Suddenly, the horse receded. He had winded the red men. He&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE PAGE A CAPTIVE.                467&#xD;
dashed back ard, and as he did so, seizing their moment, they&#xD;
both darted upon the half-awaking Juan, and had seized him&#xD;
by the arms before he had become fully conscious. The rude&#xD;
assault brou ht him back to consciousness. He strove to shake&#xD;
off his capto s, but his struggles were-feeble; his arms fell use-&#xD;
lessly, unper ormingly, beside him; arid he showed his submission&#xD;
by signs. . hy should he struggle against fate? What had he&#xD;
to live for? Why should he dread the death which he now&#xD;
fancied to b certain?&#xD;
The red en possessed themselves of the page's dagger, the&#xD;
only weapq' which he carried. With their stone hatchets&#xD;
waving in hi sight, they motioned him to rise. By signs they&#xD;
bade him recover the horse, which he did without effort, but they&#xD;
were sufficiently wary not to suffer him to mount. The beast&#xD;
was led accordingly, and the boy proceeded with his captors all&#xD;
on foot; the squaw having joined them in compliance with their&#xD;
repeated halloos.&#xD;
The destrier was now docile enough, following his master.&#xD;
The page feebly' led him on. But he soon sank down by the&#xD;
way. One of the red men would have brained him with his&#xD;
hatchet; but the other, who was the older, and the woman, ~~nt~r-&#xD;
posed. Th~ latter soon perceived the boy's exhaustion, and&#xD;
while one of the men went off in search of a spring or .rivulet,&#xD;
the squaw darted into the woods, bringing back with her, after a&#xD;
little while, some leaves, and a small round acid fruit. The lat-&#xD;
ter she squeezed into the page's mouth. The kaves she pressed&#xD;
upon his forehead. Water was brought in a leaf shaped like a&#xD;
slipper, of ~rhich he drank freely. In a little while he was re-&#xD;
vived. When he recovered sufficiently, he motioned them by&#xD;
signs to let him ride, on~e of them taking the bridle within his&#xD;
hands. The proposition was a startling one, and led to a long&#xD;
discussion among the captors, which was finally settled 'by the&#xD;
eldest of the party, who seized the bridle with the most heroic&#xD;
air of self-sacrifice, in one hand, while with the other, waving&#xD;
his stone hatchet, he threatened the head of the horse with sud-&#xD;
den stroke, at the first suspicious symptom. Juan mounted with&#xD;
feeble heart and limbs, indifferently, and only resigned to the&#xD;
wishes of his captors.&#xD;
And thus the four travelled for six or eight weary hours.&#xD;
Noon came ~nd went. The sun at length was faintly smiling&#xD;
farewell over the' forest, at the~ closing of his pilgrimage, When&#xD;
the Party came in sight of the beautiful river, the Coosa, at the&#xD;
spot where ~t first acquires an individual existence, from the&#xD;
junction of the Etowah and the Oostanaula.&#xD;

&#xD;
t{ere was an encampment of the red men. They co d be&#xD;
seen in crowds along the banks of the river. But the e es of&#xD;
Juan were fastened upon a group that 'was gathered ben ath a&#xD;
'sort of canopy upon the hillside. They slowly approaches this&#xD;
t3tation. The pages eyes brightened as he drew nigh. S rely,&#xD;
it is Don Philip that 'he sees, seated upon the ground in fr nt Qf&#xD;
th&amp;amp;' canopy, while the red men wander about in the back-&#xD;
ground. But 'the .page doubts. Can it be that the savag look.&#xD;
ing man whom he sees,-woe-stricken, with matted and 4 ~hev-&#xD;
elled hair and 'beard,~is his noble master-the accomp ished&#xD;
knight of Portugal-the man of grace, and stature, and be uty;&#xD;
of ease and sweetness, and clear bright eye, and generous a~ Oct?&#xD;
Can he have so altered in so short a space? Juan could sc~ cely&#xD;
believe. But he had no conception of the change which h had&#xD;
himself undergone. With a cry he threw himself from the teed&#xD;
at the feet of the cavalier-&#xD;
"Oh! Senior! Oh! 'Don Philip "&#xD;
The knight looked up for the first time as he heard the c y.&#xD;
"My poor boy, my poor Juan, is it thou, indeed!"&#xD;
And he took the boy suddenly to his embrace. He s unk&#xD;
from the grasp: he trembled like a leaf; tottered, and ould&#xD;
have fallen but that the knight held him up.&#xD;
"God be praised, Juan, that thou art again with me! I had&#xD;
feared that I should lose thee forever, my poor boy; and su ely,&#xD;
Juan, if there be any that I can now love, it is thyself."&#xD;
He again grasped the page. and drew him to his embrace. The&#xD;
head of the' boy sank upon his shoulder. His eye was b ight&#xD;
with tears. The head was relieved. The heart enjoyed a str nge&#xD;
and sudden sensation of happiness. At that moment his ear&#xD;
caught the sound of a well-known voice.&#xD;
"Philip!" said, in the tenderest tones, the beautiful Coc Ila,&#xD;
the Princess of Cofachiqui; and she laid her hand affection~ ely&#xD;
upon the shoulders 'of the knight.&#xD;
"Philipt"&#xD;
The word went liked a dagger to th~ heart of the page. he&#xD;
tenderness of tone in which it was sj~oken filled her soul ith&#xD;
bitterness. There was an agony in h~r bosom, *as sudden nd&#xD;
extreme as the rapture which had filled it but a moment be re,&#xD;
and, with the seeming recovery of all ~her strength and se sep,&#xD;
she withdrew herself from the embrace of Vascon~elos, ho&#xD;
gently released 'her.&#xD;
"Go within, Juan," said the knight, pointing him to the do&#xD;
tent of bushes before which stood the ~anopy of stained. cot n;&#xD;
&#xD;
"go within, boy, and await me, for I have much to hear from&#xD;
thee."&#xD;
With the big tears gathering in his eyes like great pearls of&#xD;
the ocean, the page did as he was commanded, having, ere he&#xD;
went, beheld Co9alla take her place by the side of the knight,&#xD;
while one of her hands rested proudly' on his shoulder, and her&#xD;
large bro~~n eyes seemed to drink in rapture while gazing deeply&#xD;
into his.&#xD;

the extent of his sway, his haughty valor, and his gigantic st&#xD;
He had heard of the approaching Spaniards, of their power,~ I&#xD;
wonderful arms and armor, their strange appearance, an&#xD;
mystery which seemed to envelop their origin. He was&#xD;
rally curious to see the strangers, and was too great a pote&#xD;
himself; and too valiant a chief to entertain any apprehensi&#xD;
their power. Of their treatment of his kinswoman, Co~alI&#xD;
had up to this period heard nothing, and his invitation, ac&#xD;
ingly, through his inferior cassiques, was cordially extend&#xD;
the Spanish commander to visit him in the recesses of his'&#xD;
domain. His chief settlements were along the banks of the&#xD;
which still bears his name-his territories stretched away i&#xD;
nitely, even beyond the waters of the Mississippi. As the s&#xD;
gers drew nigh to his royal precincts, he dispatched his son to&#xD;
them special welcome-.-a youth of eighteen, but tall like hi&#xD;
~his stature far overtopping that of the tallest soldiers i&#xD;
Spanish army. His bold and noble carriage contributed,&#xD;
his stature,~to compel the respect and admiration of the Ad&#xD;
tado and hi~ cavaliers.&#xD;
But ere the arrival of this youth, as an ambassador, there&#xD;
some stir in the Spanish camp, in consequence of the treat&#xD;
which Philip de Vasconselos had received. The return of&#xD;
de Tobar, and Andres de Vasconselos, led to warm words, a&#xD;
passion, and finally to a re-examination of the affair. If An&#xD;
felt coldly towards his brother-and no doubt his conscience&#xD;
long since rebuked him severely for his conduct, for which his bo&#xD;
pride would suffer him to make no atonement---his feelings&#xD;
kindred were by no means subdued. Now that his brother&#xD;

of the young man obtained the ascendant, and he felt his error to&#xD;
its full extent and bitterly lamented the little sympathy~ which&#xD;
he had shown to a brother to whom he was indebted for the best&#xD;
training and affection of his early years. Nor was Nuno de&#xD;
Tobar less eagerly aroused than Andres to the necessity of vindi-&#xD;
cating the fame of Philip, and, if possible, of recovering and re-&#xD;
storing him to the army. To this end their earnest efforts were&#xD;
directed. The woods were scoured where the victim ha~ been&#xD;
left to perish, but in. vain. He was already in the close keeping&#xD;
of the Princess of Copachiqui-not so far, indeed, from th~ camp&#xD;
of the Spaniards~-not so much beyond their reach-but that, had&#xD;
he himself been willing, he might have been found. But in what&#xD;
way could it be conveyed to him that he was not pursued with&#xD;
malice, and that justice should be done to his worth at last? He&#xD;
might well question the motives for the search on the part of&#xD;
those from whom he had never yet experienced sympathy or&#xD;
confidence.&#xD;
Co§alla and her followers were all well aware of the ncAghbor-&#xD;
hood of the Spanish parties sent out in search of Philip-nay, he&#xD;
himself was not ignorant, and he might possibly have suspected&#xD;
their better motives, knowing as he did that his brother and&#xD;
Nuno de Tobar were at the head of these detachments; but he&#xD;
now no longer cared to resume a connection with the associates&#xD;
who had abandoned him, and with an expedition whose daily pro-&#xD;
gresses revolted all his human and chivalrous sentiments. Be-&#xD;
sides, he had been inexpiably disgraced according to all the laws&#xD;
of chivalry, and there was no adequate power to do him justice,&#xD;
and to restore his honors. A. savage scorn of all social relations&#xD;
took the place in his bosom of the centerr sympathies he h~id once&#xD;
so loved to cherish. A fierce mood~ preyed like a vulture upon his&#xD;
thoughts, and he brooded only upo~ revenge. This was now the&#xD;
atoning, the compensative sentiment which he encouraged, ~.nd his&#xD;
thought was wholly addressed to tl~e modes by which he ~hould&#xD;
wreak the full measure of his vengeance upon the two whom he&#xD;
regarded as the principals in his great disgrace, and the bitter&#xD;
defeat of all his hopes and honor. His thought by day, his dream&#xD;
by night, found him ever engaged in the hot struggle of the gla-&#xD;
diator with Don Balthazar de Alvar6 and the haughty Adelan-&#xD;
tado; and he sat or wandered with his savage associate~, grim.&#xD;
and silent, following the progress of the Spaniards with e~ye and&#xD;
mind; a Fate, himself; threatening but too truly the melancholy&#xD;
doom which attended upon their footsteps.&#xD;
It was with a gloomy feeling of bitterness and self-reproach that&#xD;

it was yet quite too important to the safety, not I as tha&#xD;

were it not that th~y were instinctively impressed by himself by&#xD;
the great injuries which had made him the incarnation of that&#xD;
wild - revenge which the red men so much love and honor, and&#xD;
by his unquestionable ability as a commander. He, hi~nself,&#xD;
seemed to take their lead as a matter of course. He neither&#xD;
asked them nor himself in respect to the matter. He willed, and&#xD;
they submitted. He pointed with his finger hither or thither, and&#xD;
they sped. They saw his purpose in his look. They took their&#xD;
directions from his eye and hand; and there was that of the ter-&#xD;
ribly savage in his fearful glance, and so much of the sublimely&#xD;
fearful in the~embodied woe which seemed to speak in every silent&#xD;
look and gesture, that to submit and obey was the voluntary im-&#xD;
pulse of all who looked upon the noble outlaw.&#xD;
The one purpose which Occupied his mind, sufficed to concen-&#xD;
trate all his faculties. The Spaniards now began daily to expe-&#xD;
rience the influence of a will and a power which threatened them&#xD;
with the greatest dangers, the more formidable, as it was still im-&#xD;
possible to conjecture what shape the danger was to take, or when&#xD;
and where the blow was to fall. An ominous gloom seemed to&#xD;
hang upon their hearts. Superstitious apprehensions haunted&#xD;
their souls-a cloud seemed to hang upon their pathway, in no&#xD;
degree relieved by the courteous invitations of the great cassique,&#xD;
Tuscaluza. Weariness, exhaustion, daily toil and march, and&#xD;
continued disappointments, no doubt combined to render them&#xD;
especially sensible to such fears and doubts. But there were&#xD;
external evidences daily offered them which had their effect, also,&#xD;
in compelling and arousing their superstitious fears. The red&#xD;
men seemed to have altered their whole policy. They hovered&#xD;
about the advancing army, but without coming to blows. They&#xD;
no longer rushed out boldly from beneath the forest trees, in&#xD;
groups, or single men,~ challenging the invader to the crossing of&#xD;
the spears. But if they did not fight, they did not fly. There, in&#xD;
front, and flank, and rear, they might be seen to hover like so&#xD;
many threatening clouds, retiring into safety when approached,-&#xD;
not to be overtaken,-.-but still giving proofs that they were unre.&#xD;
taxing in that haunting watch and pursuit which they had b~gun&#xD;
from the moment when Vasconselos took command. It may be&#xD;
that De Soto and others suspected his presence and authority&#xD;
among the red men, and that a gloomy prescience, and vague&#xD;
terrors, were the result of this suspicion. To these feelings, each&#xD;
day added large increase. The Spaniards now longed for the&#xD;
strife; they felt how much easier and more grateful it would be&#xD;
to bring this annoyance to prompt and desperate issue, which vexed&#xD;

to beguile the savages to battle,-to ensnare them&#xD;
to run them down with their mounted men; b&#xD;
generalship of the Portuguese cavalier held them&#xD;
and they hung about the wearied Spaniards like c&#xD;
cious birds, sufficiently nigh to seize their prey&#xD;

Tuscaluza met Dc Soto at one of his villages~, at some distance&#xD;
from his capital city. lie probably did not design that the&#xD;
Spaniards should penetrate to that place. But he did not 1no~4&#xD;
the character of the invaders. The haughty chieftain welcomed the&#xD;
Adelantado in a truly m~oyal manner, with great show of forest&#xD;
state, and a dignity which might have 'furnished a model to the&#xD;
noblest sovereign of Christendom. His immense stature, erect&#xD;
carriage, haughty demeanor, perfect composure, insensibility to&#xD;
surprise of any kind, had the effect of awing the Spaniards into&#xD;
something like reverence, for a season. The Adelantado pre-&#xD;
sent~d him with a dress of scarlet, and with a flowing mantle of&#xD;
the same material. These he wore with a natural grace which&#xD;
showed him superior to the efforts of the artist. With his own&#xD;
towering plumes, he became the crowning and central figure, of&#xD;
right, amid the grand assemblage of native chieftains and steel-&#xD;
clad warriors by whom he 'was surrounded. The Adela~itado&#xD;
added to his gifts that of a horse also; though it was with great&#xD;
difficulty that a beast was found sufficiently powerful to endure&#xD;
the weight of so colossal a warrior;&#xD;
The courtesy of De Soto, his gifts and attentions we~re not.&#xD;
nupleasing to the haughty Cassique, and he cheerfully accom-&#xD;
panied them in a march of three days, to one of his first-class&#xD;
villages, called after himself, Tuscaluza. This village stood upon&#xD;
a peninsula of the Ahibama River. The river wa~ crossed with-&#xD;
~ut difficulty, and the army encamped for the night in a beautiful&#xD;
valley, about a league beyond the place of passage. There was&#xD;
feasting and great state for some hours in the Spanish camp, and&#xD;
Tuscaluza was a guest at supper with the Adelantado. But&#xD;
when he retired, it was without the precincts of the camp, and&#xD;
tl~r~ Spaniards, though on the watch to discover his place of re-&#xD;
treat for the night, failed to trace his progress through the wild&#xD;
forests through which, with his attendants, he made his easy&#xD;
way. But there were other watchers more successful, and when&#xD;
Tuscaliiza entered his sylvan lodge, but two miles from the&#xD;
Spanish camp, he found the beautiful Princess Uo~alla, his&#xD;
own niece, awaiting him in the lodge; and seated upon a pile of&#xD;
bearskins, a stern, silent, savage-looking man, one of the pale-&#xD;
faced warriors, in whose grim aspect we recognize the once&#xD;
gentle, graceful, and courtly knight of Portugal.&#xD;
Co~alla threw herself upon the neck of Tuscaluza, an~ was&#xD;

THE gigantic and haughty sovereign of the Alabamoi~s&#xD;
sensibly awed by the stern aspect which encountered him, v~&#xD;
he turned from the beautiful .Co~t*1la to welcome to his abo~1e&#xD;
outlawed knight of Portugal. Stern self-possession, calm mi&#xD;
ible endurance--as significant of the big heart and the unyich&#xD;
courage-are among the master virtues of the red men. In b&#xD;
words, Co~alia had conveyed to her uncle the simple outline&#xD;
the fortunes of Vasconselos, as well as her own, since she&#xD;
fi~st come to a knowledge of the Spaniards. Tuscaluza had h(&#xD;
o compel his respect for the knight, and to secure&#xD;
gratitude and confidence in consideration of what he had done&#xD;
the Princess. But when he looked on Philip, he saw before]&#xD;
no ordinary warrior. He felt himself in the presence of a I&#xD;
of a terror and a power, the resources and purpose of wi&#xD;
he could instantly conjecture from the mixed aspect of con&#xD;
treated woe and vengeance which, confronted him. He wekom&#xD;
the knight, but the latter had no answer; and the savage pril&#xD;
who seemed at once to comprehend the nature and the neces&#xD;
of the cavalier, sate quietly beside him upon the bear skins,&#xD;
yielded himself composedly, while Co~alla proceeded to un&#xD;
the details of that long history which she had hitherto rendc&#xD;
him in the briefest possible manner.&#xD;
To one who should regard only the outer aspects of the&#xD;
man, the features of Tuscaluza betrayed not the slightest se&#xD;
of the impression which this narrative made upon his soul.&#xD;
the pride, anger, fierce hatred, and eager impulse to war? ~&#xD;
not the less active in his bosom, because there were no ektei&#xD;
signs of their presence. At the close of the story, he simply i&#xD;
and threw off the scarlet robes with which De Soto had decor&#xD;
his person, cast them contemptuously upon the earthen floom&#xD;
his cabin, and, as he paced the apartment to and fro, he wal&#xD;
over the rich silks unheedingly. Then, after a brief interval&#xD;
stretched his hand out to Vasconselos. The latter took it ~&#xD;
out a word, and rose. He laid his own hand upon his bre&#xD;
and said, in the Choctaw dialect&#xD;

the knight. He added-" Philip shall be a great c&#xD;

How subtle are the feminine instincts., The fo&#xD;

"It is good," replied the Cassique, resuming his&#xD;
good; but let him go, till' one shall come to him&#xD;

reactions to the page himself. With a sad, longing&#xD;
Philip-who did not seem to heed him, or, indeed,&#xD;

It was then that Tuscaluza brought forth sundry&#xD;

The suggestion corresponded happily with the genius of savage&#xD;
warfare.&#xD;
"Good !" said the chief; resuming and shaking the robes, but&#xD;
without freeing them from the stains which they had already&#xD;
taken from the earth. When the next day, these stains were&#xD;
visible to the eyes of the Spaniards, the cavaliers enjoyed a pleas-&#xD;
ant laugh at the expense of the grim warrior:&#xD;
"lie drank quite too much of the Canaries last night, your&#xD;
Excellence," said Nuno de Tobar. "He hath been rolling down&#xD;
hill, and methinks hath had a taste of the river, which doubtless&#xD;
failed to relish after the wine."&#xD;
"Nay, SeiTior Nuno," was the reply, "he walked away with&#xD;
all the erectness which he showe5Lat the beginning."&#xD;
"Yes; but did you not see that he never trusted himself to the&#xD;
back of his horse. It was led off by one of his followers, afid he&#xD;
strode away on foot."&#xD;
"Yes; and had thine eyes but followed him as h~ sped, then&#xD;
wouldst thou have seen that his movement was solid and square,&#xD;
like a tower. He went not to the right nor to the left, till the&#xD;
great forests received him."&#xD;
"Then hath he had a brew of his own ere he slept, for verily.&#xD;
those stains of the scarlet are those of a man who hath wallowed&#xD;
upon the bosom of his mother, without knowing well what arms&#xD;
have embraced him. All these savages possess the art of making&#xD;
strong drink."&#xD;
"And upon that thou found'st thy argument for its necessity&#xD;
and justification. Go to, Seilor Nuno, and let not this heathen&#xD;
Prince suspect that you laugh at his weakness-if such it be~-for&#xD;
verily he is as proud and jealous of his state as ever was Lrwifer,&#xD;
when he had sway among the stars. Away to thy post, and see&#xD;
that thy detachment be in marching order!, Remember, he is not&#xD;
to suspect that there are guards upon his person."&#xD;
Such was the policy of the Spaniards. That of Tuscaluza,&#xD;
tutored as he was by Vasconselos_ was a few shades more pro-&#xD;
found. All that night these two chiefs communed together i~r the&#xD;
hovel; Co§alla, after a while, having retired~ Juan was k~pt in&#xD;
waiting, but in an adjacent cabin.&#xD;
We 'design that the strategic of the red men shall gradually&#xD;
unfold themselves. It is enough to mention here that Philip con-&#xD;
veyed to the Black Warrior a full idea of' the importance t~ the&#xD;
Spaniards of their horses, and the necessity of capturing them,&#xD;
or slaying them. He counselled the latter course as by faK the&#xD;

best, but urged, in the meanwhile, that, in the cvei~t of a&#xD;
the scene of action should always be so chosen as %~ depr'&#xD;
cavalry oC all share in the battle. It was this coui sel that~ f&#xD;
determined Tuscaluza to conduct the enemy to o~i of his&#xD;
towns, named Mauvila. This was a walled town, nd is su&#xD;
to have stood upon the northern bank of the Alab ma, at&#xD;
nqw called ~hocta~y Point. The town of Mau ila occ&#xD;
noble plain. The ails were rude, being high e bankmi&#xD;
earth and wood, filled in between great forest tr es; th&#xD;
being fastei~ied in piles with vines and reeds, and he face (&#xD;
wall being plastered with a thick coating of native clay o&#xD;
which hardened into smooth consistency in the sun and air&#xD;
defenses were slight, of course-such as strong rms an&#xD;
axes could hew down in short time and through hich th&#xD;
falconets of that day could have easily blown a cap cious o&#xD;
But the Spaniards were without artillery of any ki d. Sti&#xD;
had adequate implements for breaking their wa , if tin-i&#xD;
allowed them. The wall was pierced with loop-ho es for a&#xD;
and at certain moderate distances it was surmount ed by i&#xD;
ous towers,. each capable of holding a score of fighting&#xD;
There were but two gates, one on the east, the oth r on th&#xD;
side. In the centre of the village was a great squ re, or&#xD;
ground, around which the buildings were erected. These&#xD;
exceed a hundred in number, but they were mostly ast fort&#xD;
capable of containing entire tribes, from five hun red to&#xD;
hundred persons in each-great halls only, witho t room&#xD;
red men lodging together as in caravanserais.&#xD;
To this place, thus constructed, the Black War ior con&#xD;
his destined victims. He was accompanied by fe perso&#xD;
tenants, and no warriors. To this he had been counsel&#xD;
Vasconselos. But he had made preparations els where&#xD;
part which his followers had to play, and the con ciousne&#xD;
he was held a close prisoner by the very courteon knigh&#xD;
attended him, did. not lessen his purpose of giving the Spa&#xD;
such sauce to their supper as would effectually sp il their&#xD;
tites. When the vanguard of De Soto's army ap eared I&#xD;
the town, the Adelantado leading and accompanied y Tus&#xD;
a splendid array of the native warriors, flaunting n feath&#xD;
robes of fur and cotton, of various aud brilliant colors,&#xD;
forth to meet them. To these succeeded long line of be~&#xD;
damsels-and they were beautiful though dusk -" dar&#xD;
comely" as was the maid who was sung by ihe e 'ring m&#xD;
Solomon the Wise.-These came forth with songs nd dan&#xD;
rude pipes of reed, the simple flutes of the region cymba&#xD;

swamps.&#xD;
So far, all seemed to go as merrily as marriage ~bellsand~e&#xD;
Soto had 'no cause for apprehension; but he had some occasions&#xD;
for doubt, when, on entering the town, 'he found that; while ~e,&#xD;
himself, his officers and immediate attendants, were assigned a&#xD;
couple of the best houses of the place, his troops were to&#xD;
lodged in cabins without th~ walls. The great body of the arr~iy&#xD;
had not yet arrived, but followed on, somewhat too tardily, un-&#xD;
der the charge of' Luis de Moscoso.&#xD;
Flanging closely, but unseen, upon the steps of Moscoso-li~e&#xD;
a gathering thunder cloud that marshals its mighty legions on t~me&#xD;
very verge of the horizon-Philip de Vasconselos followed with&#xD;
a force of some three thousand warriors. A dozen times1 as&#xD;
he tempted by the heedless manner of Moscoso's march to d4rt&#xD;
upon him with his cloud of savages, and destroy him, if possible,&#xD;
before he could unite with De Soto; and long afterwards did&#xD;
he reproach himself with not having done so. Could he have&#xD;
seen the banneret of Don Baithazar de Alvaro flaunting amidst&#xD;
the gay array, he could scarcely have foreborne the effort. It&#xD;
was against Don Balthazar first, and De Soto next, that his con-&#xD;
centrated vengeance was directed. Neither of these wer~e pre-&#xD;
sent to stimulate his rage. Besides, he might mar the plot con-&#xD;
eluded upon with the Black Warrior, by anticipating the desig-&#xD;
nated moment, and some fugitives might escape on horsehac~,&#xD;
and convey to the very victims whom he sought, the intelligence&#xD;
which should enable then-i to guard effectually against'the attack.&#xD;
hungering, therefore, for the action, he was compelled to control&#xD;
himself and his red followers-no ?asy task-and which he, per-&#xD;
haps, never could have done but that he was supported by tl~e&#xD;
presence and authority of Co9alla, the Princess. She kept clo e&#xD;
beside him a~ he went, the two followed by Juan, with wild emo-&#xD;
tions of ft passionate love and anger mixed. The wretched bog!&#xD;
He, too, had his temptations, and more than once he found him-&#xD;
self meditating to lift his lance, and strike it into the back of the&#xD;
beautiful Princess, though with the certainty of immediate dea1~h&#xD;
himself; that he might end his pangs of jealousy forever. Veri-&#xD;
ly, they were great, and the tender devotion of the Princess to&#xD;
Philip, never suffered 4hem to sleep for a single moment. ~t&#xD;
wfts still a feminine consideration that restrained him. Uo4~v&#xD;
should his dying eyes meet the anger in those of Philip, wei~e&#xD;

other bodies collecting. The always extravagant s&#xD;
the Spanish and Portuguese authorities, by which&#xD;
sought to exaggerate the importance of the event&#xD;
the seeming losses of the Spaniards in the strug&#xD;

tially exposed, their thighs and legs. The darts a&#xD;
but small marks. The savages, on the other h&#xD;
well have been naked. Their furs, beai- skins, an&#xD;
of hide, afforded no sort of protection from the bul&#xD;
leer, or even the sword-cuts, the lance-thrusts,&#xD;
the horsemen and archers. Philip de Vascons l&#xD;
well the greatness .of this inequality between th&#xD;
and felt that the very numbers of the savages,&#xD;
range, were rather hurtful than helpful in the acti&#xD;
valor of the red men was a danger, since they had n&#xD;
to appreciate their foes. He strove, in every pos&#xD;
by every argument, to teach this to the Black W&#xD;
favorite captain, without offending their self-este&#xD;
nately for them he succeeded but imperfectly.&#xD;
passions of Tuscaluza both operated fatally to pre&#xD;
and make him forgetful of all the counsels of t&#xD;
knight.&#xD;
It was early in the morning of the 18th of Oct&#xD;
Soto, with the Black Warrrior, and the vanguard&#xD;
army, entered the village of Mauvila. The tow&#xD;
seen, was strongly fortified, impregnable, indeed, t&#xD;
as were common to the experience of the red&#xD;
rangements of Tuscaluza for the disposition of hi&#xD;
such as to offend the military caution -of the Ad&#xD;

duct of the red chief-of the gradual accumulatio&#xD;
dies of troops-of the collection of vast piles of w&#xD;
shafts and macanas-and of several missing soldie&#xD;
who had probably been 'massacred. De Soto wai&#xD;
anxious, but felt that it was necessary~ to tempo&#xD;
cowing of Moscoso with the main body of thm&#xD;

&#xD;
Sovereign precipitated the issue. They had scarcely entered the&#xD;
town when he signified to De Soto the abode which had been&#xD;
assigned him, while he indicated his own purpose to occupy ano-&#xD;
ther., But the Adelantado replied,.cavalierly perhaps-that he*&#xD;
did'not approve of the arrangement.&#xD;
" The BlIack Warrior will remain with me."&#xD;
The haughty soul of Tuscaluza then blazed out-&#xD;
" The Black Warrior is the king in all these countries. It is&#xD;
for him to command. 'It is. for all others to obey. The Spanish&#xD;
chief is at liberty to depart, but he must not pretend. to say&#xD;
to Tuscaluza, here shalt thou remain, or thither shalt thou&#xD;
go. Does sthe Spaniard hear ? Such is the speech of the Black&#xD;
Warrior."&#xD;
The moment wais not auspicious for a decisive reply to this&#xD;
speech, such as, under other circumstances, De Soto would have&#xD;
given. Tuscaluza waited for no answer to his words. He en-&#xD;
tered the dwelling which he had indicated as his own abode&#xD;
leaving the Spanish chief to find his way to the other. Th4t inl&#xD;
which he took shelter contained a thousand warriors. De Soto&#xD;
quietly proceeded to the dwelling appointed for his use, andl in-&#xD;
stantly sent out his officers to go secretly among his troopers,&#xD;
and command them to hold themselves in readiness for action.&#xD;
Meanwhile, he resolved, still to keep up4 the appearance of friends&#xD;
ship and cordiality. Breakfast being prepared, he sent Juan&#xD;
Ostiz, the interpreter, to invite the Black Warrior to his table.&#xD;
He was refused admittance, but his message was delivered, and&#xD;
the reply was civil-" The Black 'Warrior will come." 1&#xD;
But the Black Warrior did not come. Some time elapsed,&#xD;
and Juan Ortiz was sent with a second message, receiving the&#xD;
same answer as before. The same result followed. There wvas&#xD;
a long delay; and again Juan Ortiz was despatchied with a third&#xD;
message. -Now, whether it was that the interpreter, vexed at&#xD;
his repeated miscarriages, became insolent in his tone and lan-&#xD;
guage, or whether the red men now found themselves read y for&#xD;
a change in theirs, must be a subject of conjecture ; but, when~&#xD;
Juan Ortiz, standing at the door of the Sovereign, cried aloud to&#xD;
his subjects--" Tell Tuscaluza, that the food grows cold upon&#xD;
the table ; that the Adelantado awaits him, and sends to hinm to&#xD;
come forth at once,"-then the long suppressed storm broke&#xD;
ouit in fury. A r'ed warrior, sallied forth to the entrance, crying&#xD;
aloud, while his eyes flashed fire, and all his face was inflan ed&#xD;
with anger-.&#xD;
"Vagabond and robber, begone ! Is it. such as thou that&#xD;
darest clamor aloud at the doors of a great chief, crying, cohie&#xD;
&#xD;

forth, come forth! Away to thy robber master, an~ say to&#xD;
that when Tuscaluza comes forth it is to destroy h~m. H&#xD;
vagabond !" And as Juan Ortiz, half frightened out o&#xD;
senses, sped away, he could hear the grim say .ge exe&#xD;
proudly-.&#xD;
"By the sun and moon! This is no longer to b~ borne.&#xD;
your weapons, warriors of Mauvila, and let us put end&#xD;
insolence of these wandering wretches !"&#xD;
The speaker was the great leader of the Mauv hans-&#xD;
general-in their own phrase, the Big Warrior. e had,&#xD;
them in a hundred conflicts. He had won fame an glory&#xD;
them all. His triumphs were about to end with is con&#xD;
Having spoken, he beheld a group of Spaniards ii the&#xD;
square, closely huddled together. Ther'~ were oth r Spani&#xD;
near at hand, but passing singly. He did not notice these,&#xD;
making a signal to one of his followers, a bow and 4Lrrows&#xD;
handed him. He seized the bow, threw back from Isis shoul&#xD;
the flowing mantle of skins which he wore, and was about if&#xD;
the arrow to the string, when his purpose ~~yas arre ted and&#xD;
mover~aents anticipated by the action of one of those ool, al&#xD;
ready ~nd prompt warriors, to whom constant strif has se&#xD;
to impart resolve and instantaneous action-one althaza&#xD;
Gallegos. The sword from this warrior, already ared in&#xD;
grasp, flashed in air the moment, when the Big War ioy gra&#xD;
the bow, and before the arrow could leave the stri g, the s&#xD;
blade was ranging through the vitals of the red an, who&#xD;
dead upon the spot. And thus commenced a conflict of a chs&#xD;
ter the most terrible and bloody, destined to para yze the&#xD;
tunes of Hernan de Soto. The fate which had be~n hove&#xD;
like a storm-cloud above his head, was swooping down at&#xD;

"Ha I what'shout is this ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Coriplaimue&#xD;
&#xD;
THE soup of the Adelantado that day was cooled uneaten.&#xD;
Scarcely had Juan Ortiz entered the dwelling which his master&#xD;
occupied, and declared his tidings, when the war-whoop rang&#xD;
throughout the village, echoed by five thousand vigorous voices.&#xD;
The warriors poured forth from a thousand unsuspectedvomitories.&#xD;
They slaughtered tl~e scattered Spaniards, as, heedless of their&#xD;
leader's order, they lounged about street and square. The latter&#xD;
fought, but vainly. They were driven from the town; numbers&#xD;
of the cavaliers saw their horses slain, shot down before their&#xD;
eyes; a loss which they held to be even more serious than of&#xD;
the soldiery. To slay the horses was especially the labor ofone&#xD;
large portion of the savages. To this had they been counselled&#xD;
by their chiefs, under instructions of Vasconselos. Unlucl~ily 'for&#xD;
themselves, this was almost the only part of his instructions which&#xD;
they seem to have remembered. But, for a time, their' successes&#xD;
were too flattering to suffer them to pause. The vanguard of the&#xD;
Spaniards expelled from their walls, several slain, many more&#xD;
wounded, more than thirty horses killed outright, or maimed for-&#xD;
ever, and the whole of the baggage of the invading army, with the&#xD;
single exception of one knight's effects; these were successes cal-&#xD;
culated to turn the heads of any savage people, ignorant of their&#xD;
enemy, and incapable of any true* estimate of the means by which&#xD;
they had won success.&#xD;
And such had been the advantages gained by the red men in&#xD;
their first demonstration against the Spaniard, at Mauvila. They&#xD;
had lost their general, the fierce hrave who had so summarily&#xD;
dismissed Juan Ortiz with defiance to his master, and who had&#xD;
perished under the sudden sword-thrust of Balthazar de Gallegos.&#xD;
His son, a noble young warrior, had perished also, in the eWort to&#xD;
avenge his death, but not before he had pummelled Gallegos&#xD;
about the head and ears with his bow, until the Spaniard was&#xD;
blinded with his blood, and stunned, almost to perishing, be-&#xD;
neath his blows. The gallant savage had in vain sent his arro~vs&#xD;
at 'the mailed bosom of the Castihian knight. In slaying lialf a&#xD;
score of Spaniards the red men had lost hundreds; but there was&#xD;
no lack of numbers to take their places, and they scarcely felt&#xD;

&#xD;
their losses. It was not so with th~ white warriors, 'ho we too&#xD;
few, not to feel severely the loss of such a large roporti n of&#xD;
their whole disposable force. The result, whatever he ineq ality&#xD;
of loss, was a temporary triumph with the Mau ilians. hey&#xD;
had beaten the invader from their fastnesses, and theyw em&#xD;
possession of all the spoils of the field. They had also rel ased&#xD;
the captive Tamenes from the chains of their masters, ha put&#xD;
weapons into their hands, and thus more than rnajfle up f the&#xD;
number which had been lost by the battle to their r~nks. xu]t-&#xD;
ing in the successes which they had won, the red meh closed their&#xD;
-gates, displayed their spolia opima from the walls, and ru nir~g&#xD;
to and fro along the parapets, brandished their arm with e ulta-&#xD;
-tion, while the welkin rang with their wild shouts o triumph and&#xD;
defiance.&#xD;
Goaded with fury by what they saw, the Spanish hivairy ith-&#xD;
-out the walls, organizing themselves, rapidly dashe forwa d to&#xD;
the gates with the view of assailing them, or, at leas , for the pur-&#xD;
pose of covering the foot soldiers, who advanced w th their axes&#xD;
for this purpose. But the brave Mauvilians-too aliant, ager&#xD;
and exulting to observe a becoming prudence-n~ver su ered&#xD;
them to approach the gates, but leaping the walls in hun eds,&#xD;
resolutely took the-field, exposing their naked bosoixis fearl ssly&#xD;
to the superior weapons of the Castilians. A desperate confli en-&#xD;
sued: the numbers and reckless valor of the red en pr ving&#xD;
quite a match for the superior civilization of their f es, whil the&#xD;
struggle was confined to those who fought entirely on foot. Fi rce,&#xD;
indeed, was the affray. Mercy was neither asked or expe ted.&#xD;
The shafts of the savages answered to the lances of t~e Spani ds;&#xD;
the stone battle-axe and thundering macana did no~ recoil rom&#xD;
the sharp collision with the polished blade of the Toh~dan. I was&#xD;
only when~ the cavaliers of Spain dashed in to the support of heir&#xD;
comrades that the Mauvilians gave ground, and reti~eated t the&#xD;
cover of their fortress. Thither the moiruted men pursued t em,&#xD;
but were driven back by showers of stones and arrows fro the&#xD;
walls and loop-holes of the town. As they wavered and reco led,&#xD;
the Mauvilians again sallied forth, closing with the cavaliers, eiz-&#xD;
ing on their very bridles, grasping their lances, 1~earing t em&#xD;
from their hands, and clinging to the retiring horses i~ntil dra ged&#xD;
away hundreds of paces from the walls. Such a- conflict, val so&#xD;
inflexible, afforded but small encouragement to the ~iopes of the&#xD;
invader, and De Soto groaned over the tardy progl'ess of os'&#xD;
coso, and the absence of more than half his little army.&#xD;
In this manner had they fought, without decisive re~ults-..u less&#xD;
in favor of the Mauviians-for three mortal hours, ~rhen Lui de&#xD;

Moscoso made his appearance withthe main body of the spanish&#xD;
forces, and at once engaged in the melAe. But with his appearance&#xD;
in the field, - that of Philip de Yasconselos took place also.&#xD;
For a moment let us pause in this place, to say that none of the&#xD;
relations of this great event, as given by the Spanish and Portu-&#xD;
guese narrators, are to be entirely relied on. The history yirh~ch the&#xD;
lion might give of his achievements has yet to be written. The&#xD;
accounts of the white men are grievously confused and contradic-&#xD;
tory, for the simple reason that they labored to obscure. to mod-&#xD;
ify, and even to pervert the details whose results were so disas-&#xD;
trous to their progress, and, as they fancied, in their natio~~al pride&#xD;
and vanity, so discreditable to their arms. Now, the reader will&#xD;
please to understand that our version of the story is drawn chiefly&#xD;
from the narratives of the Mauvilians themselves, as contained in&#xD;
the celebrated MSS. of the Great lawa, or High Priest of Chick-&#xD;
asah, Golena Ithiopoholla, who wore the sacred symbols, some-&#xD;
where about the year 1619, only about 70 years after this event.&#xD;
The narrative is written on the bark of trees, in the Choctaw charac-&#xD;
ter, and, beating some few injuries from exposure and time (which do&#xD;
not affect it in the portions relating to the battle of Mauvila), may&#xD;
still be read in the keeping of my excellent red friend Mico Tus-&#xD;
kina Ithiopolla, a lineal descendant of the venerable Jawa, by&#xD;
whose hands it was written. Our account of the affair,~ ~rhich we&#xD;
modestly venture to assert is the only one deserving oP perfect&#xD;
confidence, is drawn almost entirely from this aticient and vera-&#xD;
cious chronicle.&#xD;
To resume from its pages:&#xD;
"Now had the battle lasted three mortal hours, wher~ another&#xD;
and a larger army of the Spaniards, under one of their great gen-&#xD;
erals, by name Luis de Moscoso; made his appearance in the field.&#xD;
He had been closely watched and followed during the march from&#xD;
Tuscaloosa by the white chief; to whom had been given the name&#xD;
of Istalana, and of whose cruel treatment by the Spaniards, and&#xD;
happy escape, by the help of the great Princess Co~alla, of Cofa-&#xD;
chiqui, we have already related the account. Istalana (or 'the&#xD;
chief that broods') led a force of three thousand brave warriors of&#xD;
Tuscaloosa and Cofachiqui, full command ovei~ whom had been&#xD;
given him by the Great King. Now, so soon as Istalana beheld&#xD;
the warriors of Moscoso preparing to join with the troops under&#xD;
Soto, the Castilian, and to advance against the walls of Mauvila,&#xD;
he set upon him suddenly, with a terrible assault from behind. Mo-&#xD;
oscoso was greatly astonied at this assault, for he knew not that he&#xD;
was so closely watched and followed. But he turned upon Istalana&#xD;
and his men and made good fight for the victory; and he was joined&#xD;

by the men upon the horses of Soto, the Castilian, and grea were&#xD;
the deeds of arms that followed, and many were the blows iven&#xD;
and received, and glorious was the slaughter. The earth a sun&#xD;
drank great streams of blood that day; and, for ~ th war-&#xD;
riors of Mauvila were too brave to need coverings for their&#xD;
breasts against the darts of their enemies, the slaughter fell most&#xD;
heavily upon them; while the Spaniards, being covered with&#xD;
scales of hard metal, or wrapped in many folds df a thici gar-&#xD;
ment, which shook off the shafts of the Mauvila warriors hen&#xD;
delivered from a distance, they suffered less gr~evous1y and&#xD;
many were but hurt and wounded, when, but for reason of their&#xD;
armor of metal, they would have died outright. But the an-&#xD;
vilians hurt and smote them sorely, and bruised them with any&#xD;
blows, so that none of them utterly escaped, while many ere&#xD;
slain with shafts rightly delivered between the eyes, and, hen&#xD;
they chanced to turn their backs, with arrows that drove th ugh&#xD;
the body beneath the shoulders and rested against the m ailic&#xD;
plates in front. Hundreds carried with them grievous w unds&#xD;
in the legs and thighs, which were less sheltered b~ armor ;~ and&#xD;
wherever the warriors of Castile and Mauvila strove tog ther&#xD;
hand to hand, th~ one with bright sword shining ir~ the su ,the&#xD;
other with the heavy macana, or the thundering stone ha het,&#xD;
then did the armor prove no~ help, but rather a hurt to the hite&#xD;
warriors, and they fell crushed beneath the blows of Mauvila and&#xD;
they fled before the might of her warriors. And great wa the&#xD;
destruction of the strange beast which they call the hors , of&#xD;
whom the Spaniards took great account, and, for which re son,&#xD;
th~ warriors of Mauvila smote and slew them without spa lug.&#xD;
Verily, they slew more than seventy of these giant beasts i the&#xD;
course of the day's fighting, sending the arrows right thr ugh&#xD;
their huge bodies, so that the feathers only lay hidden in the&#xD;
bowels of the beast.&#xD;
"And when the warriors within the walls of Mauvila, vho&#xD;
were commanded by the great king himself; beheld how tha the&#xD;
Spaniards were set upon by the troops of Istalana from be 'md,&#xD;
then did he rise and cry aloud:&#xD;
"'Now is the time for ye to go forth, ye warriors of Mau ila,&#xD;
and all the followers of the great king! Now send ye up the&#xD;
great shout of war which leads to victory, and get ye out om&#xD;

daughters of Mauvila gather upon the walls and cry to ye ~th&#xD;
words of love and welcome, and sing the while sweet song, of&#xD;
victory and vengeance! Now to your arms! and go forth and&#xD;
fight against the Spaniards from the walls, while Istalana, the&#xD;

&#xD;
white warrior, who is our general, deals death upon them from&#xD;
behind!'&#xD;
"'And they went forth, even as he commanded, with a mighty&#xD;
whoop of victory, which shook the earth and struck terror to the&#xD;
hearts of the pale faces. And the Spaniards, who rode the mighty&#xD;
horses, rushed together, like a great hurricane, between the war-&#xD;
riors of Mauvila, who came forth from the fortress, and the foot-&#xD;
soldiers of the chief Moscoso. And they rushed over many. of&#xD;
our people, and they trampled them under the iron hoofs of the&#xD;
mighty beasts; but the rest parted each way front before them,&#xD;
then closed behind them as they sped, delivering swift arrows&#xD;
that pierced the beasts to the bowels, and pierced the riders to&#xD;
the brain, so that they rolled together in sore agony, and with&#xD;
previous cries upon the stricken earth. And even as the War-&#xD;
riors of Mauvila sank down beneath their beasts, other braves&#xD;
darted hotly forth to take their places, and it gladdened the big&#xD;
heart of the great king that day, to behold with what a joy his&#xD;
braves died for his honor, and to save his country from the&#xD;
Spaniards. Verily, it is too much to tell; for they alone who&#xD;
saw could truly report what glorious deaths were that day given&#xD;
and received, and how the blood gushed from the big heart, and&#xD;
the brains of brave warriors were beaten out, and how the&#xD;
bowels of the mighty beasts fell down at the sharp passage of the&#xD;
lance and knife; for the cunning warriors of Mauvila, while they&#xD;
lay wounded beneath the horses, smote them suddenly under their&#xD;
great bellies. And then the beasts grew maddened, and they&#xD;
fled swiftly as the arrow flies, with a horrid scream, and grievous&#xD;
groans, the bowels trailing as they sped, until they could fly no&#xD;
more, and rolled over their riders, the chiefs in armor, whom&#xD;
they crushed beneath their own weight. And at every horse&#xD;
thus slain the women and the maidens upon the walls of Mauvila&#xD;
made a new song of rejoicing. And they sang-&#xD;
"'Great is the Brave of the Mauvilian who hath slain the&#xD;
mighty beast of the pale faces.&#xD;
"'He shall be named the Slayer of the Beast forever, and there&#xD;
shall be a totem for his bosom, with the picture of the beast.&#xD;
"'And his name shall be sung forever by the maidens of Mai~-&#xD;
vila; and the warriors shall go ever into battle with a cry&#xD;
upon his name.&#xD;
"'Verily, he shall pass the blue mountains upon the spirit of&#xD;
the beast that he hath slain. He shall hunt in the Happy Val~&#xD;
lies on the body of the beast; and when he enters the lodge of&#xD;
the Great Master of Souls, then shall a voice welcome him with&#xD;
a cry, saying, make way there-give place all of ye, for hither'&#xD;

"'Verily, as the Mauvilian hearkened. to this song, gre&#xD;
the desire of many to become the slayer of the beasts wh&#xD;
parishh warriors rode. Yet there wer~ some who sought&#xD;
to take them captive; for wherefore should the warriors c&#xD;
vila not bestride them, even as the Castilians? But the:&#xD;
number preferred to slay them, for they knew not b~&#xD;
words to make the beasts. know their masters, and they&#xD;
the danger from their heels, and they wist not how tc&#xD;
them in their flight. So they slew them, whenever they&#xD;
save in few cases, when, as was the cou~'isel of the chief I&#xD;
they caught them by their bridles after they had slai&#xD;
riders, and led them off into the thickets.&#xD;
"Now, Istalana, the white warrior, himself had one o&#xD;
beasts, upon which he made to ride a strange boy who f&#xD;
him in silence-a creature black as the great bear of Noli&#xD;
But, when the battle drew nigh, and when he was abou&#xD;
upon the troops of Moscoso, he bade this black boy take&#xD;
with the Princess Co~alla in the thicket, which was at ha&#xD;
where many harbored close unseen.4 And Istalana rais&#xD;
self with a single bound upon the back of this beast; and&#xD;
str&amp;amp;ng~th9ngs of bear skin with which to guide him; and&#xD;
chair of bear skin, with horns, but without feet, was benea&#xD;
and upon the back of ~he beast. And Istalana armed&#xD;
with a long lance which he had made, thrice as great an&#xD;
as that borne by our people. And he carried besides&#xD;
battle axe of metal which had been taken from the Sp~&#xD;
And, thus armed and mounted, he prepared to ride into&#xD;
tle even, as the Spaniards rode. But first, he put largE&#xD;
of our warriors in ambush, close in the woods, but bes&#xD;
field of battle; and he bade them not show themselves&#xD;
gave them command to do so. And he led but one thirt&#xD;
Mauvilians into battle against Moscoso, being but a ti&#xD;
men.' And to these he gave command that they should&#xD;
scatter themselves; that they should shelter themselves~&#xD;
the trees, wherever these stood, and thus escape the wrati&#xD;
mighty beasts, whom they were to transfix with their arro~&#xD;
he taught them truly, moreover, to aim their darts onl~&#xD;
faces and the thighs of the Spaniards, for 'Verily,'&#xD;
'What matters if you slay them not outright. Worn&#xD;
only, so that they shall become disabled, and how easy&#xD;
run in and brain them with the hatchet of stone.' Ai&#xD;

in the wildness of their valor, which suffered them to fear no&#xD;
danger, that so many of them yielded their naked life to the ~1eath&#xD;
shaft of the Spaniard.&#xD;
"Now, it was even in the moment when the Spanish warriors&#xD;
who rode were trampling down the braves of Mauvila, striving&#xD;
to keep them back from the conflict which had begun between&#xD;
the troops of Istalana and Moscoso, that the chief Istalana ap-&#xD;
peared in front, mounted on one of the great beasts of the Span-&#xD;
iards. Verily, the beast was of a beautiful strength and majesty,&#xD;
and he had a name with his master, and he was called Bajardo.&#xD;
And when the Spaniards beheld the beast-thouo'h they, knew&#xD;
nothing of the great chief Istalana, (for he was no longer of the&#xD;
pale sickly color of the white men~ but had been made comely&#xD;
by the war paint of the Mauvilians, and he wore feathers of the&#xD;
birds of Mauvila and Apalachia, and a robe off saffron-cotton of&#xD;
our people, and upon his shoulders a rich robe of fur which the&#xD;
Great King had given hiir~ whcn he made him a chief; )-when, J&#xD;
say, the Spaniards beheld the beast, they said one to another,&#xD;
'Is not that Bajardo, the horse which was ridden of old by the&#xD;
Blackamoor Juan, the Page of the knight of Portugal P And&#xD;
they answered, 'Verily, it doth seem so. Yet bath he long been&#xD;
missing.'&#xD;
"But they saw nothing of the Blackamoor, and they knew not&#xD;
the knight of Portugal, in the costume and the war paint of the&#xD;
Mauvilian. And the knight of Portugal, now the chief Istalana,&#xD;
rode forth towards the warriors of Spain, even to where was&#xD;
seen, making great show above the rest, the chief, Soto, of gas-&#xD;
tile, their general and great warrior. And Soto and his v~rar~&#xD;
riors marvelled much when they saw a red warrior of MauVila&#xD;
so gallantly riding towards them; and they wondered more&#xD;
when they saw him shake out his lance in defiance, waving it&#xD;
towards Soto himself, and, in the manner of the pale warriors,&#xD;
thus~seeming to bid him come to the conflict. And the captains&#xD;
and chiefs around Soto were angry,, and they said, 'Let us go&#xD;
and punish this insolent savage ;' but Soto said-&#xD;
"'Nay! It is for me to punish his insolence!' And he rode&#xD;
forth alone, a little ahead~ of tfle rest; and, seeing this, Istalana&#xD;
said to the Mauvilians-&#xD;
"'Get ye back all, and leave Soto, of castle, to me. Only see&#xD;
that others come not between us. If I slay him, or ye see me&#xD;
overthrown, then fall fiercely upon the chiefs that follow' him;&#xD;
and heed ever the things that 1 have told ye.'&#xD;
"And the warriors of Mauvila fell back. And Istalana pre..&#xD;

p ared himself for Soto, though he carried no weapon b~it the&#xD;
heavy lance, and the great axe of metal, such as the Spa~iar~~&#xD;
bore. And he had no armor upon his limbs, and he wo~re no&#xD;
buckler upon his arm. And he went unafraid to the enequnter&#xD;
with Soto, of Castile. And Soto came on briskly, with his lance&#xD;
couched for the encounter, and he little wist of the enemy who&#xD;
stood before him; and knew not bitt that ~it was a brave flative&#xD;
warrior of Mauvila; for he saw thafithey were a people the most&#xD;
daring of all the world, who were willing to fight with any foe, auci&#xD;
with any weapons, or according to any fashion. And knowing&#xD;
this, Soto said within himself-&#xD;
"'Now2 verily, these warriors of Mauvila have a world of&#xD;
impudence. Here is a savage that hath gotten him a beast&#xD;
which he knows not how to manage, yet would he undertake&#xD;
the warfare with me after my own fashion. Yet, in sooth, he&#xD;
keeps his seat with a tolerable grace and steadiness, and with&#xD;
proper teaching might be rendered a right comely and formida-&#xD;
ble cavalier. Yet shall I have to punish him with a death thrust,&#xD;
that I may rebuke the overweening presumption of his people.'&#xD;
"And so thin king and speaking to himself; Soto, the Castil-&#xD;
ian, spurred his beast forward to the meeting with Istalana, who,&#xD;
nothing loth, or slow, made his beast go to meet him, with a&#xD;
great rushing. And the two leveled their long lances, and&#xD;
there was a great cloud that wrapt them; and lo, when the cloud&#xD;
lifted, there could be seen Soto, the cavalier, falling upon the&#xD;
ground, and Istalana wheeling his great beast backward, and&#xD;
making towards Soto, with his lance ready to do him to death&#xD;
with a thrust."&#xD;

CHAPTEfl XLVII.&#xD;

"Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery&#xD;
Against these saucy walls."&#xD;
&#xD;
KING JOHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
WE have given a sufficient specimen of our Choctaw chronicle&#xD;
for a while. Relying on his authority as heretofore, we shall y&#xD;
forego the stately simplicity, and the quaint solemnity of his styl&#xD;
as far as possible in the future, and trust to that which is mm&#xD;
natural to ourselves and readers. We need repeat, after th&#xD;
sample of our authority, that his account is the most trustwort&#xD;
of all the parties; and our materials will show that he supplies&#xD;
thousand deficiencies, in the details, which the vexed vanity of t&#xD;
Spanish invaders would never allow them to put on recor&#xD;
We proceed now to our history.&#xD;
The fall of De Soto occasioned naturally a tremendous sens&#xD;
tion. The wild exultation of the red men rang throughout t&#xD;
field as for a victory already gained, and a most unexpected t&#xD;
uruph rendered certain. The A delantado of the Spaniards xv&#xD;
considered by the simple native~ in the light somewhat of a go&#xD;
man-a demi-god, who was in some degree invincible, or 11&#xD;
Achilles, only vulnerable in some small region not easily reached&#xD;
by dart or tomahawk. They~were now disabused, of this supe&#xD;
station, and their spirits rose in consequence to the highest pitc&#xD;
of hope and enthusiasm. They knew not but that he was a&#xD;
ready slain; at least, he was in the power of their champion; tin&#xD;
seemed certain, and a single stroke of the terrible lance whk&#xD;
Vasconselos carried was alone needed for the coup de grac&#xD;
Istalana, now doubly glorious, and a favorite in their eyes, seeme&#xD;
prepared to satisfy their expectations. Wheeling about to r&#xD;
turn to the charge, his lance was couched, and the vulture, con&#xD;
missioned by the fates for his destruction, already threatened L&#xD;
Soto with the consummation of his doom.&#xD;
But the Spanish chivalry were not prepared to suffer the co&#xD;
queror to complete his work of vengeance. They had seen ti&#xD;
fall of their governor; and, with a mixed howl and shout, the g~&#xD;
lant cavaliers who had attended him, and who had only remain&#xD;
a short distance from the scene of the passage between hinise&#xD;
and Istalana, now dashed forward to his rescue. They were ju&#xD;
in season. Our Portuguese Mauvilian was already upon 1&#xD;

enemy. De Soto who had succeedQd in recovering his feet, had&#xD;
drawn his sword, and was ~ready to defend himself.&#xD;
"Hernan de Soto," cried Vasconselos, to the complete aston..&#xD;
ishment of his opponent, "thy hour is come!* The doom for thee&#xD;
is written! Thou shalt die beneath the hand and curse of the&#xD;
man thou hast basely dishonored !"&#xD;
He knew the voice. He could no longer doubt the person.&#xD;
"Philip de Vasconselos !"&#xD;
"Ay! and thy fate! Prepare thee !"&#xD;
"I fear thee not, renegade and traitor !"&#xD;
"Ha! thou shalt feel me !"&#xD;
And the lance was couched at his breast. De Soto raised his&#xD;
sword in defence. Philip would have sprung from his steed and&#xD;
encountered him on more equal footing with the battle-axe, but&#xD;
ju t then the rush behind him required him to guard himself.&#xD;
Th Spanish knights were upon him. There were Nuno de To-&#xD;
ba and Balthazar de Gallegos, and many others. Philip gave&#xD;
the rowels to Bajardo. He dashed through the thick array.&#xD;
Go zalo de Sylvestre was rolled over upon the earth; Alonzo de&#xD;
Pi os was reached by ~e lance which failed to slay him, but&#xD;
kno ked out several of hi front teeth, and greatly disfiguring his&#xD;
moi~th, spoiled the prettiest face in the army. Others were&#xD;
handled only less roughly, and thundering through them as the&#xD;
great buffalo thunders through a forest of prairie dogs, the won-&#xD;
derful cavalier of the red men broke away from the network of&#xD;
foes which for a moment seemed to threaten him with captivity&#xD;
or death.' His forest followers were not idle. The warriors of&#xD;
Mauvila launched themselves, with desperate valor, into the&#xD;
thickest of the wild array, and the battle, with all its terrors, was&#xD;
resumed on every side.&#xD;
It raged with no abatement for more than an hour, and with&#xD;
no seeming change of fortune. Many of the Spaniards perished;&#xD;
many of their horses. Hardly one escaped without ~Mounds;&#xD;
but the naked red men suffered death, and not wounds, with every&#xD;
hurt. More than a thousand had perished in the strife, when&#xD;
Istalana, whose plans had been wholly baffled by the impatient&#xD;
pride and haughty valor of Tuscaluza and his general, succeeded&#xD;
in drawing off a portion of his forces to the shelter of the forest,&#xD;
into recesses where the horses could not pursue, and whence the&#xD;
arrow could be shot with unerring and unexpected aim. The&#xD;
red men disappeared almost in the twinkling of eye, leaving the&#xD;
field strewn with their bodies.&#xD;
Co9alla was the first to receive Vasconselos. But where was&#xD;
Juan? Philip looked about him with inquiry. The page was&#xD;

dust and blood of the field.&#xD;
behind him carrying bow and arrows, and was covered with t&#xD;
"AhI boy; and I bade thee not'?" said Vasconselos reproa&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
"I saw them as they surrounded thee, Sefior, and I could&#xD;
longer remain away."&#xD;
Philip smiled sadly on the Moor. But when he looked&#xD;
second time on Co~alla, he beheld that she toQ had had shared t&#xD;
dangers of the fray. She had been more fortunate than Ju&#xD;
and had been wounded in the arm. Oh! what were the pa&#xD;
of that~ young attendant when he beheld Vasconselos take t&#xD;
beautiful arm of Co~alla into his hands and carefully help t&#xD;
bind up the still bleeding limb., The hurt was fortunately slig&#xD;
But it was a wound received in his defence~ and, more fortune I&#xD;
stillit was.an arrow from her bow that stuck in the thigh&#xD;
De Soto himself; giving a painful wound, which would ha&#xD;
driven trom the field that day any cavalier of merely ordina&#xD;
courage. Yasconselus had seen, before the action was over, t&#xD;
De Soto was hurt. He saw it by his riding, though he ~tnew&#xD;
the nature of the wound. Little did he dream what hand h&#xD;
sent the shaft. When he did know, when he conceived fully t&#xD;
page and princess had both gone forth to his rescue the mom&#xD;
that they beheld his peril, the heart of the melancholy kni&#xD;
was very full. No tears gathered in his eyesb He had forg&#xD;
ten how to weep; but never did eyes declare such tender e&#xD;
tions; and he looked from Juan to Co~alla, and he took&#xD;
hand of the princess and kissed it, while he drew the trembli&#xD;
Moor to his bosom, and said to him fondly-&#xD;
"Boy, thou shalt evermore be brother to me. I have&#xD;
other brother now but thee."&#xD;
Andres de Vasconselos had been one of the cavaliers wh&#xD;
ranks that day he had so fiercely broken through. Bt~t he h&#xD;
raised no lance against that young kinsman's bosom.&#xD;
Juan trembled with terrible emotions as, for the first tin:&#xD;
he was strained so warmly to the breast of his lord. He V&#xD;
that the heart within him was like a molten sea-all fire,&#xD;
tears, scalding and streaming, but ready all the while to bre&#xD;
through all barriers and be poured out like water on the san&#xD;
But the tenderness was for a moment only, and even while t&#xD;
knight strained the Moorish page to his bosom, the Princ&#xD;
Co~alla interposed, and laid her hand first, and then her he&#xD;
upon his shoulder, and said in the most melting manner-&#xD;
"Ah! Philip! Ah! brave Philip."&#xD;
But, just then, Juan cried out with a change of feeling&#xD;

"Oh! Senior, thou art wounded."&#xD;
The red stain was apparent through the white cotton of his&#xD;
vest. The garments were sticking to the wound upon his&#xD;
bosom.&#xD;
"Let it remain," said Philip, as page and princess, now both&#xD;
excited with fear, proposed to attend the hurt.&#xD;
"Let it remain. It is nothing, and now bleeds no longer."&#xD;
It was but a flesh-wound made by the partly spent shaft from&#xD;
a cross-bow. He had pulled out the arrow during the fight, and,&#xD;
pressing the garments upon the wound, had succeeded in stop-&#xD;
ping the flow of blood. There was no time noW for surgery.&#xD;
The Spaniards had renewed the action, and Istalana was required&#xD;
~to go forth again.&#xD;
Furious with the sanguinary courage of the Mauvilians, con-&#xD;
scious of the peril which awaited his own and the fortunes of his&#xD;
army, and mortified deeply with the disgrace of his overthrow in&#xD;
the sight of foes and followers, Hernan de Soto only de1~yed the&#xD;
~action long enough to enable his followers to recover from ex-&#xD;
haustion. It was necessary to obtain possession of the town.&#xD;
There his people would find shelter and provisions, both of which&#xD;
they began to need. There had the red men stored their supplies&#xD;
for the winter. Several of the houses were great granaries of&#xD;
maize, beans, and potatoes. There, too, were their great armo)&#xD;
ries-arrows, arrow-bolts, and macanas, darts, and stone hatchets.&#xD;
To possess himself of these, was to supply his own soldiers, and&#xD;
greatly to impoverish and enfeeble the red men. There, too, ex-&#xD;
ulting in his savage pride and power, was the hateful and insolent&#xD;
Tuscaluza, the only cassique among the native princes who had&#xD;
ever shown himself really formidable to the Spaniards in Apa-&#xD;
lachia, up to the present moment. All his passions and all his&#xD;
reflections conspired to goad him to the most desperate efforts to&#xD;
make his way into the fortress of Mauvila. To remain without,&#xD;
exposed to the perpetual assaults of thousands of enemies, spring-&#xD;
ing up in the twinkling of an eye, and melting away as suddenly&#xD;
into their great forest shelters, was a prospect that threatened&#xD;
nothing short of ruin.&#xD;
But it was necessary to plan the attack upon the fortress with.&#xD;
a due regard to the thousands who guarded it, and of the other&#xD;
thousands who swarmed throughout the forests in his rear. The&#xD;
latter, too, were led by one who knew equally well what was pro-&#xD;
per to the warfare of the red men and the Spaniards. Bitter and&#xD;
savage were the moods which possessed De Soto as lie thought&#xD;
of Philip de Yasconselos.&#xD;
&#xD;
"ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH."              497&#xD;
"And I have fallen beneath his lance this day; and, but for&#xD;
my foil wers, I had been slain by the very man whom I had&#xD;
doomed o dishonor and left to death !"&#xD;
His g oomy musings were interrupted by the entrance of&#xD;
several f his cavaliers, Nuno de Tobar and Andres de Vascon-&#xD;
selos a ong them. He was about to declare the secret which&#xD;
he alone possessed, that of the identity of the red warrior Istala-&#xD;
na with he outlawed knight of Portugal. But the sight of An-&#xD;
dres, an the recollections of the old affectionate intimacy be-&#xD;
tween T~bar* and Philip, led him to a prudent secrecy.&#xD;
"No!' said he to himself. "Not yet! Let them once know&#xD;
that Phi~ip lives, and that this is he-remembering too that he&#xD;
bath bee wrongly doomed-and will they strive so bravely&#xD;
against h m? will they not, rather this brother of his, strive in&#xD;
his behal ? May he not go over to him? May he not carry&#xD;
others? In the moment of disaster, who clings to an old leader'?&#xD;
What n mbers will gladly seize the moment to pass into the&#xD;
embraces of the successful party? And know we not that many&#xD;
have sou ht occasion to drop away upon the march, and giving&#xD;
with the e savage women to grow to power among' the tribes?&#xD;
No! no! I mt'st hush and hide this damnable discovery close&#xD;
in the he rt, where it only works to torture."&#xD;
Such w re the brieg hurried, and natural, but unspokeri~ thoughts&#xD;
which oc urred to the Adelantado, when he beheld his knights&#xD;
enter to r ceive their orders. De Soto could not throw off the&#xD;
savage gi om that possessed his soul and filled his countenance,&#xD;
but he ga e it an expression of swift ferocity.&#xD;
"Well, seniors, you are ready. It is time. Let us now to&#xD;
work, wit all our soul and strength, to scourge these savages to&#xD;
the utter ost. Before the sun shall set this day, we must be in&#xD;
in possess on of yonder fortress. If we fall, our day has ended!&#xD;
Do you h ed me, all? While this sun lasts we must conquer&#xD;
yon town, and hold it in possession. Yonder forests,"-~and he&#xD;
shuddered as he pointed to them-" harbor ten thousand ene-&#xD;
mies, hate ul and hating us, without pity or affection; with num-&#xD;
bers dest~ ed to hourly increase, pouring in ever as the vultures&#xD;
throng ab ut the carcass. Let us go forth."&#xD;
They w re soon in full array, and in the field. De Soto had&#xD;
already m tured his plans. He had detailed the greater and bet-&#xD;
ter portion of his cavaliers for the defence of his rear, while a&#xD;
chosen bo y assailed the for1~ress. The horsemen were particu-&#xD;
larly reser ed, the better to avoid the shafts shot securely from&#xD;
the walls. They were appointed to that better service upon the&#xD;

plain in which the, steed can exercise the chief faculty, that of&#xD;
fleetness, 'which confers upon him his peculiar uses in war.&#xD;
The battle was resumed. Tuscaluza and his warriors prepared&#xD;
for the Spaniards along the walls. Istalana led forth his troops&#xD;
from the forest, and against their rear. He was encountered by&#xD;
the picked chivalry of De Soto which, in separate bodies of teu&#xD;
men each, occupied the plain in their front, and, cased in armor-.&#xD;
all the vital parts protected except the eyes-offered but 'small&#xD;
marks for the archery of the red men, while in their successive&#xD;
charges they swept down hundreds. The horse was more vul-&#xD;
nerable, however, though some pains had been taken to protect&#xD;
him in the more exposed and sensitive regions of his body. Ista-&#xD;
lana, or, as we shall henceforth prefer to call him, Vasconselos,&#xD;
aimed at two objects-to bring his troops, only as archers, into&#xD;
full play, and at the same time to cover them as much as possi-&#xD;
ble with the trees of the forest froni the sweeping charges of the&#xD;
horsemen. But, if he kept the cover of the forest wholly, he&#xD;
failed to reach the cavalry with his arrows, the plain being of&#xD;
*      such extent; and not to drive them from it, was to leave the&#xD;
garrison without succor, or diversion, to endure the whole weight&#xD;
of De Soto's assault. He accordingly prepared to throw a body&#xD;
of five hundred active warriors, good with spear and 'battle axe,&#xD;
between the detachment of cavalry in front of him and the forces&#xD;
with which De Soto assailed the walls, while the rest of his troops,&#xD;
covered as much as possible by the forest, kept the horse in full&#xD;
employment with their arrows. He, himself, on foot, prepared&#xD;
to lead his~spear-men into the thickest of the fight, and between&#xD;
the two divisions of the Spanish army.&#xD;
"And now," saith our 'old Choctaw chronicler, "the glorious&#xD;
fight began once more, with a shock as of many thunderbolts.&#xD;
And Soto, of Castile, led his great men close up against the&#xD;
walls of Mauvila; and the great king confronted him there with&#xD;
a terrible flight of arrows; and with heavy stones he drove him&#xD;
back from the fortress. And when Soto, of Castile, was thus&#xD;
driven back, he fell upon the warriors of the great chief Ista-&#xD;
lana, and very terrible was the battle that ensued between these&#xD;
mighty men of war. But, though many of the Spaniards were&#xD;
slain and more hurt, yet, by reason of the armor of tough metal&#xD;
which they wore, many escaped, who else had been done to&#xD;
death, by the valiant strokes o~ Jst~dana and his spearmen. These,&#xD;
on the other hand, being all men of naked valor, w~e sore&#xD;
stricken by the Spanish bolts and darts; and the wise chieftain,&#xD;
Istalana, ,when that he beheld how the battle went against his&#xD;

&#xD;
people, e drew them cunningly away from between the ranks&#xD;
of the S aniards, and gave them shelter for a season among the&#xD;
great tre s of the forest. And De Soto, of Castile, again strove&#xD;
with the great king against the walls of Mauvila, and his axe-men&#xD;
toiled to cut though the walls, and to beat down the gates of the&#xD;
fortress; and a second time were they driven back, sorely smitten,&#xD;
because f the heavy stones delivered from the fortress. And&#xD;
again d~d the brave Istalana 'give battle to the retreating&#xD;
Spaniard , and to those who fought from the backs of the mighty&#xD;
beasts. ud the battle went now one way, and now the other,&#xD;
and, for season, neither party prevailed in the conflict. But&#xD;
great wa the loss, and grievous the blows of blood which were&#xD;
delivered on both sides among the champions. And, among the&#xD;
people o Mauvila, there was great slaughter. Many cassiques&#xD;
of fame erished in valiant agonies, crying to the gods to open&#xD;
the blue ansions in the happy valley, and to send for them the&#xD;
bright m idens, each bearing a cheering bowl to quench the thirst&#xD;
of the w aried spirit. The mighty Oolenoe Ifisto was the first&#xD;
to fall, h ing slain many foes. Then Chinabee Himantla gave&#xD;
up the g ost, wearing more than thirty scalp locks upon arm&#xD;
and thig ; and there were many more, brave like these, who&#xD;
sang that day the song of the last fight. And many other great&#xD;
chiefs we e stricken and hurt in the fighting of this day. -Istalana,&#xD;
the great hief himself, was stricken twice, but he said nothing of&#xD;
his hurts, while he gave death, to other men to drink, sorely&#xD;
against th will of him who hath no thirst.&#xD;
"But i was not only to the chiefs of Mauvila that the hurts and&#xD;
the death were given. The Great Chief of the Spaniards, Soto of&#xD;
Castle, fe t the sharp arrows in his thigh and side; but he was not&#xD;
slain. T e lying prophet of the pale faces was scored with~a fly-&#xD;
ing shaft, ike a coward, in the back. But he lived, that men&#xD;
might say this is the mark of one who fled. And there was a&#xD;
goodly yo th, a kinsman of Soto, of Castile, one whom they ball.&#xD;
Carlos, w ose throat The arrow filled, so that he never called for&#xD;
drink agan. And many were the warriors and chiefs besides,&#xD;
for whom they made bitter moaning that night in the camp of&#xD;
the Spani rds.&#xD;
"But t e truth demands that I declare, that, on the third as-&#xD;
sault upon the walls of Mauvila, the warriors of Soto, of Castile,&#xD;
prevailed. And they prevailed by reason of the fact, that the&#xD;
Great Kin was hurt with a lance that entered his bosom even&#xD;
where he strove with a great warrior at the gate of the fortress.&#xD;
And when the warriors of Mauvila beheld the Great King fall,&#xD;
they sent ~ip a mighty cry. Anithe women, with foolish tongues,&#xD;

&#xD;
spread it along the walls and through the town, that the Great&#xD;
Eling was slain, even Tuscaluza; but, of a truth, it was not so.&#xD;
Grievous was his hurt, and glorious, since it was made upon his'&#xD;
open breast, in full front, and even in the moment when, with his&#xD;
mighty stone-hatchet, he clove the brain of a great warrior of&#xD;
the Spaniards. But, nevertheless, men thought him slain; and&#xD;
when his people bore him away from the gate to a place of safety&#xD;
without the walls, and into the forests on the other side-as was&#xD;
counselled by the prophet-then the women lamented, and the&#xD;
foolish warriors broke their weapons and lied from the walls&#xD;
which they were bade to defend, and went hither and thither, not&#xD;
knowing what to do; and, by reason of this folly, the followers&#xD;
of Sot~, of Castile, broke their way through the walls,, and beat&#xD;
down the gates, and their great captains, on their mighty beasts,&#xD;
rode headlong through the streets of Mauvila, smiting as they&#xD;
went. Then was it too late, when our warriors hastily caught up&#xD;
their arms, and renewed the fight.&#xD;
"And the women ~f Mauvila strove, too, in the ranks of battle, ~&#xD;
and very great and glorious wa~ the slaughter. But the&#xD;
Spaniards prevailed in battle against our people, and when this&#xD;
was beheld by the ilKave women* of Mauvila, they seized bright&#xD;
torches of the living flame. And they gave it wings; and they,&#xD;
sent it from housetop to housetop; and they hid it away in the&#xD;
hearts of the houses. And where they had their husbands slain,&#xD;
they flung themselves into the burning houses, and they wel-&#xD;
comed the coming of the Spaniards with arms of flame, waving&#xD;
them on, as they passed 'over the walls and through the gates&#xD;
with songs of triumph and defiance. It was a day of rich&#xD;
blood. And the people of Mauvila left for the Spaniards only a&#xD;
feast of famine, and music of agony and groans, with a raging&#xD;
fire to quench the thirst which they knew, from eating at such a&#xD;
banquet. The brave Tuscaluza, the son of the Great King, was&#xD;
slain ; but the Great King himself was made safe in the big&#xD;
forests lying toward Chickasah. Thither came also the mighty&#xD;
chief Istalana, who had previous hurts upon his breast, upon his&#xD;
face, upon his arms and side. Sorely was he stricken; and&#xD;
they brought him upon the shoulders of the Tamenes toward&#xD;
Chickasah, and the princess Co~alla, of Cofachiqui, tended him,&#xD;
while he lay hurt, and the strange black page, Juan, watched be.&#xD;
side him nightly when he slept."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
"He bears&#xD;
A tempest which his mortal vessel tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
PERICLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUCH w s the terrible battle of Mauvila. The Spaniards had&#xD;
obtained t ~e victory. They had won the chief fortified city of&#xD;
the Mauvi ians. They had expelled the inhabitants or destroyed&#xD;
them. Th sands of the redinen had perished-not so many,&#xD;
by thousand s, as the conquerors claim to have destroyed, but still&#xD;
the havoc had been terrible, and the victims were five times as&#xD;
numerous s the whole army of ID~ Soto. The rash valor of the&#xD;
Mauvilians their naked bosoms,, the superiority of the Spanish&#xD;
arms and rmor, had naturally rendered the defeat a massacre!&#xD;
But the triumph of the invaders was dashed by their own&#xD;
terrible los es, and De Soto lamented his victory in the language of&#xD;
Pyrrhus. Nay, it did not require such another victory to leave&#xD;
the Cpstili n ~onqueror undone. He was already undone, and&#xD;
he felt it. The gloom of despair was on his soul. His fac~e wore&#xD;
a perpetual scowl. His language was harsh to all when he&#xD;
spoke. H was no longer the confident, frank, impulsive cava-&#xD;
lier, who c uld sweetly smile upon his friends, and who bore in'&#xD;
his bosom n exulting hope and consciousness of desert, which&#xD;
filled all w o beheld with unvarying auguries of success. He&#xD;
was now st in, savage, suspicious; distrustful of friends and for-&#xD;
tune; with the mortifying conviction that he had not only failed,&#xD;
in the grea hopes which had inspired his enterprise, but doomed&#xD;
to other fa ures, involving fame as well as fortune; perilous to&#xD;
life as to s ccess. He thought of the noble woman, his wife, left&#xD;
behind hi in the Government of Cuba, and bitterly remembered&#xD;
that betwe n her and himself rolled the great sea, and between&#xD;
that sea an his warriors, spread hundreds of miles of impene-&#xD;
trable fore t, every thicket of ~which harbored its hosts of im-&#xD;
placable a d sleepless enemies.&#xD;
'And as t e details of his real condition met his ear, the gloom&#xD;
grew deep r upon his visage and within his soul. Very wretched&#xD;
was the co edition of the Spaniards after the battle of Mauvila.&#xD;
Moire than two hundred of them had been slain or put hors de&#xD;
corn~at. S arcely a man had escaped entirely unhurt. De Soto&#xD;

himself was thrice wounded, and though not, in either instance,&#xD;
severely, yet the hurts were of a sort to goad, to mortify his&#xD;
passions, and to vex his pride. We have secrn, what were his&#xD;
personal humiliations also. But he was not allowed to brood on&#xD;
them. Th~ condition of his army demanded all his thoughts.&#xD;
His soldiers, covered with wounds, were attended by a single&#xD;
surgeon, and he was at once slow and unskilfui. There was&#xD;
neither lint, nor linen, nor liniments; neither medicines w)r&#xD;
bandages; neither ointments nor instruments; not even clothing&#xD;
and shelter. The fires of the wild Mauvilians had consumed all&#xD;
the stores of commissary and surgeon-all the food and physic-&#xD;
all that was needful fbi' the healthy, no less than the suffering and&#xD;
sick. The dwellings were all consumed, and but a poor shelter&#xD;
was found in the miserable tents of boughs and branches, which&#xD;
could be raised by the feeble efforts of the least wounded among&#xD;
the Spaniards. For bandaging wounds, they tore the shirt~ from&#xD;
their backs; to procure unguents for the hurt, the slain I~idians&#xD;
were torn open, and the fat taken from their bodies; the slain&#xD;
horses were cut up and their flesh preserved, for sustenance for&#xD;
all. Even their devotions were interrupted, in the loss of the&#xD;
wine and wheaten" flour which they had used in the performance&#xD;
of the mass; and to the superstitious, the question became one of&#xD;
serious importance, whether bread of Indian meal might be em-&#xD;
ployed for the sacrament,-a question gravely discussed aihong&#xD;
them, and terminating in the unfavorable resolve, that it was not&#xD;
tolerated by thi~ canons of the church. When to the real physical&#xD;
miseries of their situation,~we add those of their spiritual hunger,&#xD;
we may conjecture the terrible gloom which overspread the en-&#xD;
campment of the Spaniards.&#xD;
This gloom of his followers was naturally of deeper and darker&#xD;
complexion in the soul of De Soto, than it was among his people.&#xD;
His had been the loftiest ambition, the most exulting hope. His&#xD;
pride, and station, and responsibility, were greater than all the&#xD;
rest. He was proportionately overwhelmed in the common catas-&#xD;
trophe. He was utterly unmanned by his reverses. Not that&#xD;
he was unwilling to fight and peril himself as before; but that he&#xD;
was no longer able to control his passions, and hide his infirrni-&#xD;
ties, and develop the strength and resources of his genius.&#xD;
moody irritable and savage, he was now purposeless in his aim,&#xD;
and utterly hopeless of favorable events in his future progress.&#xD;
-He had no longer the heart for enterprise, or the spirit for ad-&#xD;
venture; and, for eight days, he lay in his rude and inadequate&#xD;
encampment, among the ruins of. Mauvila, like a wounded tiger,&#xD;
licking his wounds in his jungle. Meanwhile, the wounded suf-&#xD;
&#xD;
ISOLATION OF SO-TO.                503&#xD;
fered, or covered, died or lived; without seeming to arouse his&#xD;
active se sibilitics. The army, under his gallant cavaliers, began&#xD;
slowly to repair its hurts, and to recover, after a fashion, from its&#xD;
maims an bruises. But it was the skeleton only of its former&#xD;
strength, nd symmetry and beauty. The despondency of their&#xD;
chief opp essed the spirits of all. Hope had deserted 1~hem, and&#xD;
they now only sighed for the opportunity to return to those dis-&#xD;
tant horn s which few. of them were ever destined to behold&#xD;
again.&#xD;
It was while they lay thus, and suffered, in the town of the&#xD;
Mauvilian ,-groaning with their hurts, and dreading every&#xD;
moment t ~t the red men would surround, and compel them to&#xD;
resume t e struggle to which they felt themselves so unequal,&#xD;
that they received intelligence which was calculated to cheer&#xD;
them with the hope of escape from the perilous meshes in which&#xD;
their ente prise had involved them. Tidings reached them, un-&#xD;
expectedly, of the arrival, at Achuzi (now Pensacola) of certain&#xD;
ships from Cuba, under the command of Gomez Arias and Diego&#xD;
Maldonad . The moment this news was~received; both officers&#xD;
and men began to calculate the distance between Mauvila and&#xD;
Achuzi. t was-according to their eager estimate-but eight&#xD;
days jour ey to the sea coast; and all hearts began to cheer&#xD;
themselves with the hope of sooti reaching the ships, the succor&#xD;
of their c mrades, and finally the pleasant country which all&#xD;
now were prepared to regret that they had so idly left. No one&#xD;
thought t remain in a region which yielded them no golden&#xD;
cities, and he people of which betrayed such implacable hostility,&#xD;
such indo table courage, and such sanguinary fierceness of&#xD;
character. They discussed the matter among thena~elves. They&#xD;
encourage each other with their new born hopes of escape from&#xD;
a country, n which they beheld nothing but sleepless and bloody&#xD;
enemies-i 1 which they could now anticipate nothing but disaster&#xD;
and a gloo y fate for all. These resolVes and desires were freely&#xD;
spoken. T ey were not confined to the common soldiers; and De&#xD;
Soto7 by ac ident, overheard one of these discussions, in which the&#xD;
same opini ns and wishes were expressed by his favorite cavaliers.&#xD;
From th t moment, his resolve was taken. lie could not re-&#xD;
turn a vag ond to Cuba. He who had gone forth in such state&#xD;
and spend r, could not crawl back in the sight of his people, ~&#xD;
maimed a stricken fugitive. He must first conquer. He&#xD;
must win t e spoils he sought. He must carry back the, proofs&#xD;
and the tr phies of the golden cities which he had promised.&#xD;
He still ha faith in the hidden treasures of the Apalachian. He&#xD;
still looked to the conquest of a semi-civilized people, such as&#xD;

those of Mexico and Peru, the overthrow and dominion of whom&#xD;
would crown the close of his life with glory, and redeem and re-&#xD;
pair the hurts of character and credit which had confes~edly&#xD;
accrued from his enterprise, up to the present moment. He&#xD;
resolved to confound his cowardly followers, and to baffle all&#xD;
their imbecile calculations. He determined that they should&#xD;
share his fortunes, in spite of all their fears. He did not suffer&#xD;
them to know that he was aware of their secret hopes. He&#xD;
simply gave his orders-to turn their backs upon his shipping, and&#xD;
go forward, deeper, deeper, into the wild abodes of the savage&#xD;
Apalachian.&#xD;
His cavaliers, as soon as they heard these orders, boldly nn-&#xD;
dertook to expostulate with him upon* them. They spoke of&#xD;
the sea, of the shipping at Achuzi, of their hopes and homes in&#xD;
Cuba.&#xD;
"Tell me not of sea, or ships, or Cuba !" was the angry reply&#xD;
of the Adelantado. "I will see neither, until I have conquered&#xD;
these savage Apalachians, and won possession of their great&#xD;
cities."&#xD;
They would still have expostulated. "There were no great&#xD;
cities" was the answer. "These people are mere savages. Our&#xD;
people despond. They have not the heart for further adventure.&#xD;
Their hearts are set only on returning to the sea coast, and&#xD;
availing themselves of the shipping, of once more reaching Cuba.&#xD;
They are already discontent with the delay. They will&#xD;
mutiny-."&#xD;
"Ha! mutiny! Tell you this to me? Then get ye ready your&#xD;
executioner, and prepare to do as I require, for by the Holy Cross,&#xD;
so long as I breathe, the Yic&amp;amp;Gerent here of our Royal Master,&#xD;
I will put to sharp justice the soldier who shall only dare to&#xD;
murmur. Away, Sir Knights, and let me hear no more of&#xD;
this."'&#xD;
"The habitual exercise of authority had imparted to De Soto&#xD;
a power of command, which was admirably seconded by a sub-&#xD;
mission as habitual, as well among his cavaliers, as common&#xD;
soldiers. The obedience of the one, necessarily enforced that of&#xD;
the other. The army was put under marching orders, and, with&#xD;
weary footsteps and responding hearts, the remnant of the army&#xD;
took its way into the great solitudes once more.&#xD;
But the one purpose~ of progress, in Dc Soto's mind, was un-&#xD;
directed by that aim and design which constitute the first true&#xD;
essentials of successful adventure oti the part of the soldier.&#xD;
Disappointed hitherto in the results which followed his several&#xD;
enterprises, he knew not now whither to direct his footsteps.&#xD;
&#xD;
WHAT OF ISTALANA.                  505&#xD;
From th S moment, his only labor seemed to be to increase the dis-&#xD;
tance bet veen his people and the sea. Haunted by the dread of their&#xD;
desertion , he simply hurried forward, on a route that perpetually&#xD;
changed ts direction, now east, now west, hither and thither, but&#xD;
always t no purpose. He knew not, nor seemed to care to&#xD;
know, w either he sped. Stern, silent, irritable, he scorned&#xD;
counsel and forbade expostulation. He wandered thus, in&#xD;
weary pi grimage, day by day, passing from forest to forest,&#xD;
from vill ge to village, fighting wherever the red men crossed his&#xD;
path-w ich they did perpetually-and fighting always without&#xD;
an object One is forced to think, seeing how erratic was his&#xD;
progress, ahd how recklessly he incurred all perils, that his real&#xD;
purpose as to end a struggle which brought him vexation only,&#xD;
and a life which, his pride taught him, was dishonored by the de-&#xD;
feat of all his expectations.&#xD;
While ur Spaniards were recreating themselves in Mauvila,&#xD;
what of t e people of the Great King, Tuscaluza? what of the&#xD;
Portugue e Knight, whom we now know as Istalana, the im-&#xD;
mediate confidant of the Mauvilian Cassique, sorely wounded&#xD;
in the fina battle with the Spaniards. Both of these chiefs were&#xD;
seasonabi borne away by their red followers to a place of&#xD;
safety in t e contiguous forests. As these proceedings were all&#xD;
transacted with the greatest secrecy, by a peGple practiced in the&#xD;
utmost subtleties of savage warfare, as cunning as the serpent,&#xD;
and as ste lthy as the cat, the Spaniards never dreamed of the&#xD;
vast num ers, that, more or less hurt, were carried safely from&#xD;
the meUc; and the still greater numbers, who escaped when the&#xD;
conflict we t too decidedly against them. The Mauvilians had&#xD;
lost proba ly three thousand warriors, and a few score of women&#xD;
had perish d also fighting in their ranks; but a numerous army&#xD;
still remain ed to the Great King, even of those engaged ~t Mau-&#xD;
vila; while others daily poured into his assistance, led by the&#xD;
Cassiques f tributary provinces. Had he or Istalana been able&#xD;
to take th field, the spaniards had never been suffered to rest a&#xD;
moment in Mauvila; had never been permitted time to repair&#xD;
their disas ers and to recruit themselves fqr a fresh campaign~&#xD;
Had their quarters been beat up daily and nightly with incessant&#xD;
alarm; ha their foragers been cut off whenever they went forth;&#xD;
it is proba le, that the eight days of rest at Mauvila, would have&#xD;
been so mai y days of struggle and starvation, en ding in their utter&#xD;

red men did not dare to venture upon the enterprise for them&#xD;
selves. They were content to gather and prepare themselves.&#xD;
to provide a new armory; to lay in supplies of provisions; to&#xD;
guard their wounded monarch; and watch closely all the move-&#xD;
ments of the Spaniards. Tuscaluza had been severely hurt, but&#xD;
the red men, rarely outraging nature with the too frequently im-&#xD;
pertinent pretensions of art, were good nurses, and not bad sur-&#xD;
geons, in that day, when they did not feel their own deficiencies&#xD;
and had not learned to succumb to the genius of the white man.&#xD;
They had considerable knowledge of pharmacy, and dealing with&#xD;
green wounds, which were not necessarily mortal, they were&#xD;
singularly successful. The conquering people have borrowed&#xD;
many good lessons, and much knowledge, from their skill in&#xD;
medicine.&#xD;
Of course, Istalana shared with the Great King, in the best at-&#xD;
tentions of his people. Nay, he had probably even better attend.&#xD;
ance, for was not Co~alla his nurse, and was not Juan nigh,&#xD;
jealous of her cares, and watchful of every opportunity to inter-&#xD;
pose his own? Vasconselos had suffered from several wounds.&#xD;
He had been brought from the field in a state of utter insen-&#xD;
sibility. Borne on a litter through the forests to a place of&#xD;
safety, remote from the scene of action, he had undergone a long&#xD;
struggle with the mortal enemy of life. Youth, great vigor of&#xD;
constitution, fond and sleepless cares, and a loving solicitude that&#xD;
neglected nothing; to those he owed his recovery. During all&#xD;
his sufferings, through a long insensibility, fever and delirium,&#xD;
Co9alla never slept. Ah! the devotedness of the loving heart-&#xD;
the loving woman! How it galled the soul of Juan to see her&#xD;
officious tenderness, when he could not interpose-when he dared&#xD;
not. How it angered him, when Co~alla bound the fever balm&#xD;
to the fqreheacl of the unconscious Knight-when she bathed his&#xD;
hands and arms in cooling waters; when she applied the bruised&#xD;
herbs to his wounded side and bosom, when she poured the cool-&#xD;
ing beverages into his burning lips, when she sate' by him, and&#xD;
lifted his head upon her arms, and against her bosom, and mur-&#xD;
mured softly in his ears, her fond, exulting consciousness-" oh!&#xD;
Philip! my Philip."&#xD;
Then would the page chafe with vexation. He betrayed his&#xD;
anger. He was rude to Co~alla. He complained even of her&#xD;
officious zeal, and sleepless attendance.&#xD;
And Oo~alla pleaded with him as if she had been no princess.&#xD;
She knew that the boy loved the cavalier, and for this she&#xD;
forgave him all his offences. It was quite enough with her, that&#xD;
the rude boy was devoted to his master. That, she saw. She&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIX.&#xD;
"Set we forward&#xD;
Never was a war did cease,&#xD;
Ere bloody hands were washed."&#xD;
&#xD;
Cn1mEUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE warriors of the Apalachian had been set in motion, by the&#xD;
impatient Tuscaluza, before Vasconselos ,~as able to take the&#xD;
field. His pride made him impatient. Advised of every step&#xD;
in the progress of' the Spaniards, he had commanded that their&#xD;
steps should be followed; and, taking counsel, for awhile, from&#xD;
Istalana, he had pursued a cautious policy, which studiously fore-&#xD;
bore risking anything on a general battle. His present chief&#xD;
warrior was Chiea~a, who controlled an immense district of'&#xD;
country, and could bring at least five thousand warriors into the&#xD;
field. The progress of De Soto had now brought him into the&#xD;
territories of this Chief. To him, Tuscaluza-preparing himself'&#xD;
to take the field-had sent instructions to harass the Spaniards,&#xD;
cut off detachments and supplies, whenever occasion offered, but,&#xD;
on no account, to engage in general action. It was the fortune of'&#xD;
the Great King to Apalachia, to possess great Captains, who, like&#xD;
the ambitious Chiefs am6ng more civilized nations, have too&#xD;
much self-esteem to hearken to the words of counsel, or even to&#xD;
obey the commands of' their superiors always. Chicaza ventured&#xD;
battle with the enemy, and was defeated. But not till a dread-&#xD;
ful massacre had taken place, as terribly murderous to the red&#xD;
men as that of Mauvila, and quite as fatal to the Spaniards.&#xD;
De Soto had possessed himself of' the village of Chicaza.&#xD;
The first act of the fierce Cassique was the destruction of his own&#xD;
town. He decreed it to the flames. It was a bitter cold night&#xD;
in February, the north wind blowing wildly, and dark clouds&#xD;
scudding across the sky, whei~ the Cassique led his forces, in&#xD;
three separate bodies, to the attack. The Spaniards knew not o~&#xD;
their danger, till the dwellings, in which they had sheltered them-&#xD;
selves, were all in flames. Scouts and sentinels, officers and&#xD;
men, had been alike neglectful df duty. The red men stole into&#xD;
an unmatched camp. They gave no alarm, until they had laid&#xD;
their inflammable torches beneath the cottages, and until their&#xD;
shafts, tipped with lighted matches, had swept to the straw-roofed&#xD;

~ Spaiilards could only groan, not exult! Fift&#xD;
~rs had been slain, with several hidalgos amen&#xD;
~iy horses had perished also,\and a like numbe&#xD;
ess hurt. At one time, but for Nuno de Tobar an&#xD;
~con~elos, the Spaniards must have been utterly&#xD;

ere brought back by Tobar. The Portugues&#xD;
is veterans, in fact, were the true saviors of' th&#xD;

regard to their sufferings and wishes; he dis&#xD;
sympathies, by the rejection, of all communion~&#xD;
is best officers, among them Nuno de Tobar an&#xD;

&#xD;
Yet why do ye go with him in your hearts, that ye may the&#xD;
better pluck down ruin on my head."&#xD;
"What means his Excellency," demanded the confounded&#xD;
Nuno de Tobar. The scowling eyes of IDe Soto were set upon&#xD;
Andres de Vasconselos. The latter proudly answered, and with&#xD;
a calm cold sterness of manner, which made the resemblance&#xD;
between himself and brother much more evident than ever.&#xD;
"I know not what your Excellency designs to say, for a truth&#xD;
all that you have spoken sounds strange and unmeaning in mine&#xD;
ears; but if their be any purpose to charge aught of our disasters&#xD;
upon my neglect of duty or want of loyalty, then do I demand&#xD;
that you name my accuser, and my sword shall answer to his false-&#xD;
hood."&#xD;
'~ Even thus he spoke! Thus he looked! Thus he defied me&#xD;
ever 1" cried IDe Soto, his memory still retaining full recollection of&#xD;
the reserve and self-esteem which in the case of Philip de Varco-&#xD;
melos had always offended the amour propre of the Castilian.&#xD;
"Of whom speaks the Adelantado?" demanded Tobar.&#xD;
"Of whom! Jesu! one would think you bad slept, without&#xD;
hearing the cries of war, without feeling the shock of battle,&#xD;
without scathing in the scorching flames that swept over us by&#xD;
nightduring the last thirty days of strife and honor."&#xD;
Such was the sudden burst of seeming astonishment, with which&#xD;
the adelantado replied to his lieutenant. He continued, ardently&#xD;
and wildly-&#xD;
"Of whom should I speak, but of that insolent Jate which has&#xD;
dogged our steps from Ghiala, and which hangs over us with ruin.&#xD;
Oh! ye know not. Ye are blind. Ye will remain blind until the&#xD;
knife is at your throats, and there is. no means left ye for escape.&#xD;
Hark ye! Ye have seen De Soto overthrown, for the first time&#xD;
overthrown, in single combat; man opposed to macn, lance to lance&#xD;
steed to steed. And ye have seen all this achieved by ~ naked&#xD;
savage of the Apalachian! No mail upon his breast, no helmet&#xD;
upon his brow, no crest upon gleaming shield, declaring his deeds&#xD;
in war. Yet he had a name. Once he had crest and shield, and&#xD;
cuirass. Ha! Ha! A red savage! and ye thought it was a mere&#xD;
savage, a naked Apalachian of the hills, whose lance could foil that&#xD;
of Hernan De Soto, whose charge and thrust could roll the Gas-&#xD;
tilian warrior into the dust. Oh! blind! Hark ye! It was no&#xD;
red man no Apalachian, though wearing his semblance. It was&#xD;
this accursed Fate, I tell you, that pursues us now, that will still&#xD;
pursue us, that will fee~d upon us all, even as the vulture and the&#xD;
wolf glean among our bones bleaching in the wilderness. But I&#xD;

And with the famous slo an of Spanish* battle, the maddened&#xD;
cavalier dashed forward to ie assault.&#xD;
Meanwhile, as the Spania ds clearly saw, the red warrior web&#xD;
comeci the encounter; for e waved his long lance aloft in the&#xD;
sunlight, and he, too, advance d as if glad to engage in the mortal&#xD;
struggle with the noble Ca tilian. But it was no part of the&#xD;
policy of the Spanish knight or soldiers to suffer the Adelantado&#xD;
to peril himself in single combat, in his present diseased and&#xD;
feeble state. Besides, they had seen the wonderful and unac-&#xD;
countable prowess which the red warrior had shown on horseback.&#xD;
They naturally concln~1ed the one before them to be the same&#xD;
who had already overthrown their leader, and they began to share&#xD;
in the superstitions w ich he had taught them to respect. They&#xD;
dashed forward in a ody to the support of Dc Soto, and, with&#xD;
their approach, the s range warrior of Apalachia melted fr~rn&#xD;
sight, man and horse, uto the dim shadows of the impenetrable&#xD;
forest.&#xD;
"Whither went he?" demanded the Adelantado. "Did the&#xD;
earth swallow him? id ye see him ride away ?"&#xD;
"Verily," said one, 'he disappeared as suddenly as he came!&#xD;
We saw nQt how! Perhaps into the forest."&#xD;
"But had he not be~n a fiend from hell, could he have sped&#xD;
from sight unseen-unheard?"&#xD;
The knights crossed themselves solemnly, and each muttered&#xD;
to himself a prayer.&#xD;
"It is the Fate-my Fate!" exclaimed Dc Soto as they led&#xD;
him back; "but I shall cross weapon with him yet! Sant Lago&#xD;
against the Fiend, myrrien ds! I will conquer mine enemy ~"&#xD;
Days passed; the ~paniards still pressed forward; still har-&#xD;
assed by their sleepless enemies, and unable, with all their ai~ts,&#xD;
to bring the wily red n~en to a general action. But Dc Soto was&#xD;
told of a fortress into which Chicaza, the Cassique, had thrown&#xD;
himself; upon the very borders of his province, and where he&#xD;
appeared preparing to defend himself. The news seemed to con-&#xD;
centrate all the energies and purposes of De Soto. It gave him&#xD;
a definite purpose. Them fortress was called Alabama, and stood&#xD;
upon the banks of the Yazoo river. The garrison was large.&#xD;
The fortress was strong and built like that of Mauvila. The&#xD;
Adelantado at once led his army against it; clouds of the red men,&#xD;
under Tuscaluza and Istalana, hanging upon his wings and rear.&#xD;
A terrible fight ensued; the infantry of the Spaniards assailing&#xD;

shame together in t~ie depths of the wilderne s. He was a fine&#xD;
example of the terrible selfishness of ambition.&#xD;
The erratic progress of De Soto at length brought him to the&#xD;
banks of the Mississippi. His was the first European eye, ac-&#xD;
cording to the authentic history in our possession, which ever be-&#xD;
held the , turbi~1 and wondrous streams of the "Father of&#xD;
Waters." De Soto gazed upon them with but little interest.&#xD;
He dreamed not of the glorious territories which they watered.&#xD;
He saw not, through the boundless vistas of the future, the nu.&#xD;
merous tribes who should dwell upon their prolific borders,&#xD;
crowning them with the noblest evidences of life, and with the&#xD;
loveliest arts of civilization. The spirit of the Adelantado was&#xD;
crushed. The fires of ambition were quenched in his bosom.&#xD;
His heart was withe ed: his hope was blasted forever. He was&#xD;
now a dying man; not exactly a maniac, but with a mind ill at&#xD;
ease, disordered, vacant, capt'icious; striving with itself: weary,&#xD;
and longing only for the one blessing, which he had never suffered&#xD;
himself to enjoy ;-Peace! His heart did not exactly crave a res-&#xD;
toration to his home in Cuba, but the image of the noble wom-&#xD;
an, his wife, rose frequently, reproachful in his sight. He had&#xD;
loved her, as fervently as he could have loved any woman; but,&#xD;
in the ambitious soul love i&#xD;
love, but accords in s a very tributary passion. It craves&#xD;
little return. Its true passion is glory!&#xD;
We have foreborne a thousand details of strife, anxiety, dread and&#xD;
suffering, which the Spaniards were doomed to experience before&#xD;
they reached the Mississippi. They were haunted by the perpetual&#xD;
terrors of th~ Apalachians. Tuscaluza and his Portuguese Lieu-&#xD;
tenant Istalana gave them no respite. They crossed the Mississip-&#xD;
pi. They penetrated the country of the Kask5kias, and still they&#xD;
were under the eye ~mnd the influence of the Great King of the&#xD;
Apalachians. The terrors of his name met them on every side.&#xD;
The powers of his arm smote them in all their progresses. "The&#xD;
Fate! The haunting and pursuing Fate! Oh! Philip de Vascou-&#xD;
selos !" cried De So5 to himself-" thou art terribly avenged.&#xD;
Would that we could meet mine enemy! would that, alone, we&#xD;
stdod naked, front to ~'ront, on the borders of this great heathen&#xD;
river, spear to spear, i~nd none to come between. Then, then!&#xD;
Thy spear or mine! Thy fate or mine! I have wronged thee,&#xD;
Philip de Vasconselos, but I should slay thee nevertheless.&#xD;
Verily, thou art terril9y avenged. I have wronged thee, but&#xD;

sliould'st decree their destruction also? Yet thou shalt not!&#xD;

CHAPTER L.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Last scene of all&#xD;
That ends this strange eventful history."&#xD;
&#xD;
sHaKSmEAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
OUR previous narrative of events has brought us to the open-&#xD;
ing of the summer of the year 1542. We have reached the&#xD;
melancholy close of all those glorious prospects, and triumphant&#xD;
hopes, with which Hernando de Soto left the shores of Cuba, for&#xD;
the country of the savage Apalachian. He was a subdued and&#xD;
broken-hearted man; humbled in spirit, mortified in pride,&#xD;
ruined in fortune. He hadtsurvived all his hopes. Despair had&#xD;
taken possession of hi~ soul. To crown his misery, physical&#xD;
suffering was superadded to his griefs of mind, and wounds, and&#xD;
travail, fatigue and fever, had combined to prostrate the iron&#xD;
frame of him, who, in the pride of muscular vigor, had never&#xD;
dreamed that any toil or trial should have forced him to succumb.&#xD;
Nothing short of this utter prostration of his physical strength&#xD;
and energies, would ever have compelled him to yield the point&#xD;
to Fate-.would ever have moved him to listen to the entreaties ~of&#xD;
his followers~now urged with a stern resolution that would no&#xD;
longer brook denial, to turn back from the forests to the sea,~&#xD;
and endeavor once more, to regain the shores of that beautiful&#xD;
island, which, even the proud spirit of De Soto himself, be-&#xD;
moaned in secret, with a fond and fearful anxiety. On the banks&#xD;
of the vast and lonely Mississippi, occupying the Indian village&#xD;
of Guachoy-a, the Adelantado gave his orders for the construction&#xD;
of a couple of brigantines, such as would enable him to seek the&#xD;
sea.&#xD;
His people set themselves to this work, with the eagerness of&#xD;
rn6n, to whom the fruition of all their hopes is promised. While&#xD;
bodies of 'them were engaged felling and seasoning timber, others&#xD;
scoured the country, seeking adventures and provisions; and&#xD;
above all, to prevent the too near approach of the swarming&#xD;
hordes of red men, by whom, ever since their approach to the&#xD;
~territories of Tuscaluza, their fortunes had been followed. That&#xD;
Fate, as De Soto himself esteemed it-which had hung upon&#xD;
their steps and striven against them, with a bitter hostility from&#xD;
~the moment when Vasconselos was lost to the Castilian columns,&#xD;
~nd Istalana suddenly sprang into existence, as the leader of those&#xD;

town, and the scattered dwellings of th~ place, required to be well&#xD;
watched. De Soto, to his usual habits of precaution, had, of late,&#xD;
adopted others of an extreme sort, betraying a morbid appre-&#xD;
hension of' danger. His sentinels were doubled; each night his&#xD;
cavalry mounted guard in the suburbs of the village, bridle in&#xD;
hand, and ready for the sally or defence. A patrol of troops&#xD;
alternated, during the night, between the. several stations;&#xD;
while, along the river, cross..bowmen in canoes kept vigilant&#xD;
watch upon all approaches from the opposite shores.&#xD;
But this vigilance was observed only while De Soto was him-&#xD;
self able to assert his authority. With his increasing illness, all&#xD;
this organization fell to pieces." The extra sentinels were dis-&#xD;
pensed with; the cavalry found it hard to mount guard during the&#xD;
night, when they had probably been on a foray all day; the troopers&#xD;
findingthere were no alarms, gave up patrolling; the cross-bow.&#xD;
men fell asleep in the canoes. The Spaniards were now stead-&#xD;
fast only in the labor of building their brigantines; and all duties&#xD;
that seemed to interfere with the prosecution of this work, were,&#xD;
either in part, or entirely foregone. Gradually, as the heats of&#xD;
summer began to prevail, all toils in the sun were relaxed. The&#xD;
forbearance of' the red men, for several weeks, had persuaded the&#xD;
Spaniards that they had endured the worst of their dangers from&#xD;
this source. They little knew how much of this forbearance they&#xD;
owed to that person, who had grown into the embodied Fate&#xD;
of their great leader; and to whose agency, in especial, he as-&#xD;
cribed the defeat of his enterprise and the destruction of his for-&#xD;
tunes.&#xD;
Philip de Vasconselos-the Cassique Istalana,-who had now&#xD;
the entire charge of the forces of Tuscaluza on the Mississippi -&#xD;
seeing how the Spaniards were engaged in the construction of&#xD;
their brigantines, readily divined their object. He had no motive&#xD;
to prevent their departure, and, consequently no desire to em-&#xD;
barrass them in their progress. Still, there was one hostile feel-&#xD;
ing, the gratification of which he had not enjoyed. His revenge&#xD;
was incomplete. Could he have separated the Spaniards from&#xD;
their Oaptain-could he have struck at kim-Aim and another-&#xD;
there had been nothing left him to desire! He well knew that&#xD;
through him De Soto had been baffled-that he was a subdued&#xD;
and broken-hearted man; but it must be confessed that he still&#xD;
yearned for the opportunity to bring the long issue between&#xD;
them, to the final settlement of blood! This was the black s ot&#xD;
in the soul of the Portuguese Cavalier.&#xD;
It was a- warm and sunny afternoon of summer. The Span~&#xD;

&#xD;
* as he went; Juan also saw and followed him. He rowed him~&#xD;
self rapidly across the creek, and stood upon the Opposite bank,&#xD;
at no great distance from the line of lodges which the Spaniards&#xD;
occupied.&#xD;
All w~ quiet in the encanipinent. Groups of the soldiers and&#xD;
workmen could be seen in the distance, along the banks of the&#xD;
river. An occasional figure wound his way along the public&#xD;
thoroughfares. The approach to the cabins was Partly covered&#xD;
by trees: but beneath them not a single sentinel could be seen.&#xD;
Philip eagerly pushed forward, but with the subtle stealthiness of&#xD;
the red man, and taking care always to cover his person from&#xD;
sight. Flow was the page, Juan, astonished; when, crossing the&#xD;
creek as rapidly as he could after his lord, and ascending also to&#xD;
the level of the high ground leading to the Spanish camp, he&#xD;
beheld the Knight entering one of the lodges of the enemy!&#xD;
At that moment, he was called to by name from some one in&#xD;
the rear. He looked back. Co~alla had crossed also; bow and&#xD;
arrow in hand, and her face and voice equally declaring her&#xD;
alarm. She was followed by several well manned canoes. Very&#xD;
hateful was the beautiful and loving Co~alla in the eyes of the&#xD;
page. He never answered her call, but, as if vexed by her pres-&#xD;
ence and pursuit, he too pushed forward, in the direction which&#xD;
his lord h~d taken, seeming quite reckless of the peril which he&#xD;
ran.&#xD;
Hernan De Soto, a mere skeleton of himself lay weak, ema-&#xD;
ciated, weary of life, upon his bed of death! He was alone-he&#xD;
had been left to sleep by his attendants who had withdrawn&#xD;
to an outer apartment. The building was one of those great&#xD;
lodges of the red men, which were capable upon occasion of&#xD;
holding a thousand men. It had been divided by the Spaniards&#xD;
into several compartments by the employment of quilted stuffs,&#xD;
hides of wild beasts, and of their own horses, and matting&#xD;
wrought by Indian art from native grasses and the bright yellow&#xD;
reeds which grew along the banks, woven together with wild&#xD;
oziers which were every where found in great abundance. The&#xD;
couch of De Soto was prepared of like materials, over which&#xD;
~ soft dry rushes were strewn in sufficient quantity. The lodges,&#xD;
thus divided, as we have described, afforded several capacious&#xD;
chambers; the best of which, fronting the south west, was occu-&#xD;
pied by De Soto, but having in front ~f it a verandah which had&#xD;
been carefully enclosed with vines and mats, in order to the ex-&#xD;
clusion of the fierce glare of the sunshine. In this verandah, lay&#xD;
drowsing a group of his attendants; others were wont to occupy&#xD;

gamed, or wandered in the shady thickets.-they did anything&#xD;
but watch. They left this duty to the foragers, who, under&#xD;
several of the most active knights, usually made a daily progress~&#xD;
over a circuit of ten or fifteen miles along, the higher country, and~&#xD;
thus scouring it daily, persuaded themselves that they kept th~&#xD;
danger at a distance. It would have been easy to have darted ~d&#xD;
upon the camp, thus loosely guarded, destroyed the growth otj&#xD;
the brigantines, and cut oW at one fell swoop, the entire garrison,&#xD;
with its once brilliant captain. But the soul of Philip de Vascon~&#xD;
selos, even while it nursed fondly the passion for a great revenge,&#xD;
was not prepared to fall upon the people with whom he had so&#xD;
long marched as a companion. He found it easy to persuade the&#xD;
Great King to consent to the wiser policy of suffering the Spaniards&#xD;
to depart, rather than to risk the lives of thousands more of the&#xD;
red men, in the effort at their violent extermination by battle.&#xD;
Tuscaluza had lost so many of his bravest warriors already, that&#xD;
he listened to the counsel thus given him, and the war, thence.&#xD;
forth, was conducted a~ the discretion of Istalana.&#xD;
But Philip de Vasconselos demanded his one victim. Had he&#xD;
been able to see liernan de Soto, in field or camp, he might have&#xD;
curbed his passion until the opportunity should offer of cutting&#xD;
him off when but few troops should be engaged on. either side.&#xD;
Not seeing him for so long a space, he began to apprehend that&#xD;
he, too, might have fallen in battle, or by disease, and had been&#xD;
buried secretly by his followers, who naturally dreaded lest the&#xD;
red men should wreak their savage fury on his remains, should&#xD;
they be discovered. Curious to ascertain the truth, eager to&#xD;
pacify his great revenge, Vasconselos could no longer forbear the&#xD;
inquiry, though urged at the peril of his own life and liberty.&#xD;
Circumstances, as we have shown, favored his adventure.&#xD;
There were no guards in attendance; there was no watch about&#xD;
the lodge of De Soto, and though certain esquires occupied the&#xD;
closed verandah upon the south-west, whom Philip could not see,&#xD;
and whose presence he did not suspect, yet were these as little&#xD;
prepared for danger, or assault, as were the several groups that&#xD;
lay in the shadows of' the trees, and brigantines, or who loitered&#xD;
among the broad avenues of the woods. The greater body of&#xD;
the Spaniards in camp, were distributed among the several&#xD;
lodges, either gaming, or enjoying that repose which the heats of&#xD;
the season began to render exceedingly grateful, after several&#xD;
hours of labor in the sun. A deep silence overspread the dwell-&#xD;
ing in which De Soto was sighing away his life, when Vasconselos&#xD;
passed between its portals. He had been utterly unseen. He&#xD;
paused in the ante..chamber, on the northern side of the building,&#xD;

uncertain. But, as the light of consciousness gradually dawned&#xD;
upon his mind, the gaze quickened with intelligence.&#xD;
"Ha !" he said-" I dream! I do not see&#xD;
"Thou dost see, Hernan de Soto! thou dost not dream. The&#xD;
Fate thou hast challenged is beside thee."&#xD;
"Ha! then! It is true. Thou art here. \Ah! wilt thou strike&#xD;
when I have no weapon. Let me but prepare for thee, Philip&#xD;
de Vasconselos, by the Holy Virgin, thou shalt see what is the&#xD;
prowess of a true man, against the bosom of the renegade and&#xD;
traitor !"&#xD;
And the feeble chieftain lifted his hand and pointed to his&#xD;
armor hanging against the wall, and motioned as if he would&#xD;
have risen; but he sank back feebly and shut his eyes, mur-&#xD;
muring-&#xD;
"Be it as thou wilt! strike, if thou hast the heart for it! I&#xD;
have no prayer to offer to thee; traitor as thou art."&#xD;
"That word alone should doom thee to sudden blew, 11cr.&#xD;
nan -de Soto," answered the Knight with stern~ ~mphasis,&#xD;
"but I will not strike thee. I will lay no hand upon thee noW&#xD;
in anger. There is a more powerful grasp upon thee than any I&#xD;
can lay. Thou art in the hands of the great master ~f life, and&#xD;
I willdo nothing more against thee. Yet, Heaven be my witness,&#xD;
de Soto~ if I would not gladly help thee to thy armor, and sc~&#xD;
thee once more put on all thy strength, while I stood before&#xD;
thee, with battle-axe, armed as now, and thou with any weapon&#xD;
or armor that thou wouldst, with none to come between us,&#xD;
and thy life and mine decreed to hang upon the justice of our&#xD;
cause. Traitor! Who made me a traitor, if I be one? Who&#xD;
robbed me of my rights, my good name, my honors and my&#xD;
manhood? Who drove me into the arms of the red men,-who&#xD;
despoiled me of my abode, and security among a christian&#xD;
people? Who but thou? and it is thou that darkest now, with&#xD;
the hand of death upon thee, and the dread of eternal judgment&#xD;
staring thee in the face- thou, to call me traitor! It i~ thou, I&#xD;
tell thee, Hernan de Soto, that art the traitor and the criminal&#xD;
Thou that hast dishonored the noble order of knighthood by&#xD;
dishonest judgment; thou that didst debase thee from the rank&#xD;
of the gentle and the noble, in becoming the tool and the slave&#xD;
of the cunning criminal, who warped thee to his villanous pur-&#xD;
pose, making c~f thy soul a thing even fouler than his own&#xD;
"Ha! shafl I submit to this insolence !" answered De Soto ir&#xD;

He turned with surprise, in the direction whence the sound .&#xD;
arose, much wondering to perceive the boy behind him; when,&#xD;
even at that instant, the bolt was delivered from the cross-bow of'&#xD;
one of the Spaniards, and he beheld the boy, as he threw himselfP&#xD;
directly upon his path. .The next instant he saw Juan roll over&#xD;
upon the sward, with the arrow quivering in his bosoni. The&#xD;
boy had thrown off his armour of eseaupil, as most of thie red&#xD;
men had done in that warm season, and not expecting strife; and&#xD;
in his jacket of thin, unquilted cotton, the deadly shaft had met&#xD;
with no resistance.&#xD;
-With a deep cry of sincere sorrow, Yasconselos darted back-&#xD;

He followed the sounds, and safely entered the canoe with his'&#xD;
speechless burden. The rowers bent to their task, the boat shot&#xD;
through the reedy thicket, and had nearly reached the opposite&#xD;
shore, when a crowd of Spaniard , all armed with arquebuse and&#xD;
cross-.bow, appeared along the n argin of the shore which they&#xD;
had left. There were shots sent after the fugitives, bullet and&#xD;
arrow, but with hurried aim-they were delivered fruitlessly.;&#xD;
and while a thousand of the red men answered with their fearful&#xD;
whoops, the shouts and threats of the Spaniards, the war canoe&#xD;
of Coealla shot safely into cover, in a lagune hidden from all&#xD;
sight by the dense thickets of its reedy shore.&#xD;
In a green lodge 'by the river side, they laid the insensible form&#xD;
of Juan, the page, upon a bank of rushes ; and Philip de Vascon-&#xD;
selas, with a grievous sadnesss at his heart-.-for he saw that the&#xD;
wound of the boy was mortal-proceeded tenderly to withdraw&#xD;
the deadly shaft from his bosom, where it was deeply lodged.&#xD;
But, at the very first effort, when it became -necessary to tea'r&#xD;
open the vest of-the boy, his eyes opened, and he raised his hands,&#xD;
and pressed down his garments, and murmured that they should&#xD;
desist. -But in this effort he again fainted; and while he was&#xD;
thus unconscious, Philip de Vasconselos cut the strings which&#xD;
secured the jacket of the boy- in front, and ho, when he had open-&#xD;

"Alas'!" he said, "my poor Olivia, it needs not. Know 1&#xD;
not r~ow!"&#xD;
And she answered-&#xD;
"But thou knowest not that I am innocent of wrong doing,&#xD;
Philip, and. this is what I would show thee."&#xD;
She spoke but little more, but of this she was most eager to&#xD;
speak. And she bade him look into her jacket of escaupil, where,&#xD;
a packet had been sewn up, which should teach him all her cruel&#xD;
history; how she had been wronged, but how she was inno-&#xD;
cent; how she had been dishonored, but how she was an unwil-&#xD;
ling and unconscious victim to the base and cruel arts of her&#xD;
brutal kinsman. In this packet thus delivered, he read the tern-&#xD;
ide history of her griefs, even as we have already delivered it.&#xD;
But he did not read until she was no more.&#xD;
She died in the arms of Philip; but she bade that Co~alla&#xD;
should turn away her face, and leave the spot, e~e the parting&#xD;
moment came. Then she bade that Philip shoul~l lift her from&#xD;
the rushes, and when he did so, she threw her a~ms about his&#xD;
neck, and laid her head upon his bosom, and so her pure and&#xD;
suffering spirit went, with a sweet sigh, and a fond embrace, the&#xD;
memory of which, in long years after, sweetened greatly the soli-&#xD;
tude to the heart of the knight of Portugal. They buried her,&#xD;
in the great solitudes of the Mississippi, under the shades of many&#xD;
guardian trees, and the river rolls ever along with a deep mur'-&#xD;
mur near the hallowed spot, as if it sang 'fond anthems for the&#xD;
repose of a troubled soul.,&#xD;
Midnight, and there was a solemn stir in the spanish encamp-&#xD;
ment. There was a roll of martial music, and the wail of solemn&#xD;
voices, as they'sang the awful dirge of death over the remains of&#xD;
the once mighty Adelantado, ilernan de Soto. Then, in the&#xD;
deepening darkness of the night, they placed the corse of the&#xD;
Adelantado in the core of a green pine tree, which had been hol-&#xD;
lowe~ out to receive it, and, nailing over this a cover of heavy&#xD;
plans, they towed it from the shore, under an escort of an. hund-&#xD;
red canoes, to the centre of the river, and there, with a solemn&#xD;
service,:t~ey consigned it to a' bed beneath the great stream,&#xD;
sinking it deeply, lest the avenging red men should possess&#xD;
themselves of the corse of him who had wrought them so much&#xD;
evil while he lived, and wreak upon his unconscious frame the&#xD;
fury which possessed their' souls against him.&#xD;
But Philip de Vasconselos, who beheld the scene,, and readily&#xD;
divined the nature of the solemn service, would not suffer his&#xD;
warriors to disturb its progress; and from the banks of theT rivers&#xD;
