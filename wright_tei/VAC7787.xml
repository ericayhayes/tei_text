TEE history of the world is, and has always been marked by progression&#xD;
and regression. And as we see the wrld emerging from darkness, or retro-&#xD;
grading into ignorance and suVerstition, our sympathies are keenly a*akened.&#xD;
~he present age, especially inour country, ia 'distinguished for great light,&#xD;
iind intense moral darkness. For it is a~fact that greatlyadvan~ed as 'We&#xD;
are in the! elen~ents of civilization in one ?ortio~u of the laud, there is ~*&#xD;
other pa~of us who are plunged into the Puto*iian gloom.of all ihat is&#xD;
fearful, idolatrous, and revoltin* In the. northern territory of the g~eat&#xD;
state of Texas, is a tract of country as large as the state of Tennesee, ex~&#xD;
tending south from the cQrnerof Arkansas, near the Red 1~iver to the Am~r.&#xD;
icgn Desert, at the extremity of Indii~n Territory, which is compar~tively~Ul-&#xD;
explored, and about ~*hiohas little is known as the head ~ouro~. ef~l~.&#xD;

degraded slaves (although they themselves are the most inferior) in a bou1~&#xD;
ago more~fearful than the most diabolical tyranny practiced by the unlettered&#xD;
cannibal of the isolated isles of the Pacific.&#xD;
l~he following pages describe the varied scenes of Slavery. I have take&amp;amp;&#xD;
Kentucky as the~ section of my story, the evil being milder. tb~ere than ~n&#xD;
States further South. I have travelled over neari al~ of the S6iithern' and&#xD;
Western states, and from the careful and ri d observations which I have&#xD;
made, I state the circumstances here nariate~'&#xD;
This work is founded on facts: this I solemnly aver-I will not pretend&#xD;
to say that I have not embellished; but many of the occurrences I describe, -&#xD;
I have witnessed with m~wn eyes. Perhaps m,~uy'of my readershave also&#xD;
seen themselves, or iead in the journals of the day, concerning these tram.-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
I have adopted the.double 1~arrative and Dramatic form something differ-&#xD;

narration of &amp;amp;e Slave, the remarks o~ thewrit4,and the descriptwe parts&#xD;
as follows. Chapter eight, "M~r Fath~r's Deatb" is entirely a /nihrration by&#xD;
Nelse, the Slave. Chapter sixteen" Libert$e ~ is the Auth9r'~ remarks.&#xD;
Chapter twenty-two, "The Maniac and Murder~r," is descriptive, and Chap.&#xD;
tsr three, "The School Teacher" embraces all-narrative, descriptive and&#xD;
commentive.&#xD;

security or amNguity.&#xD;
The hero of this tale, Nelse is still living, and I have faithfully followed&#xD;
the side of truth in his relation.&#xD;
The names of the persons are false names; for instance, the real name of&#xD;
"Morse," is Moore; a wholesale can~y" maker on, Main st., Louisville.&#xD;
~RuskV is Rust, Lexington, Jawer; an so on, I have varied the real names&#xD;
throughout.&#xD;
Some ma~ ask, why is there not more negro language? The reason is&#xD;
with some exceptions that most of the slaves talk the English language as&#xD;
properly as we do ourselves.&#xD;
If any part seems to appear too violent, I solemnly declare that I have&#xD;
not treated of cruelties which would require the utmost stretch of credulity&#xD;
to believe, 'and;even then it would seem but the fanciful creation of some&#xD;

'~ Well, Mr. Diweme, ugain. Esrei&#xD;
since the world existed, there ha~&#xD;
been Abolitionists. The Saviour him-&#xD;
self, was an Abolitionist. He came&#xD;
into the world to abolish sin and&#xD;
misery. The Reformers who have&#xD;
followed, made it their object to abol-&#xD;
ish false systems of worship. Men&#xD;
have used every means to abolish in-&#xD;
~'m prance. And now these Aboli~&#xD;
onists of whom you talk, saw that&#xD;
Slavery was a damning blot upon the&#xD;
land,~ and abolished it in their own&#xD;
'states; and 'not content with this&#xD;
they are now using their exertions to&#xD;
eradicate it from their sister states,&#xD;
thus obeying the dictates of con-&#xD;
science, and the "higher law" of&#xD;
God."&#xD;
"But! but! ~r. Fairchild, in do-&#xD;

I annul my allegiance, and become&#xD;

- to self-preservation, and the diction&#xD;

e should we not obey the laws of reason,&#xD;
and of humanity. In this it is but a&#xD;
s weak argument 'to throw the blame&#xD;
~ upon the shoulders of the innocent I"&#xD;
"But they are too rash-these&#xD;

posed. Evesi the great ~ner~ and&#xD;
all other reformers, have ,thus met&#xD;

''On this. -Sa1~urday,~ -Mr. Puverne-&#xD;
haviug..~ome busin~ss -to transact at&#xD;
some distance'. as ;Ii.-~---, invited&#xD;
the school-teache to accompany him.&#xD;
~The invitation - was- readily accepted, -&#xD;
and after diimer they-mounted their~.&#xD;
horses and left 4 use.&#xD;
After ridi ng. the main road&#xD;
for s9me.Aist&amp;amp;rice,~hey branched off&#xD;
&#xD;
into a bye-path in the woods. An&#xD;
eastern person has but - a slight idea&#xD;
of the roads out West. For miles&#xD;
you will squeeze through the-narrow&#xD;
openizigs of the forest, then mount-&#xD;
ing some steep acclivity on the other&#xD;
side, ~rou descend into a low valley, at&#xD;
the bottom of which you suddenly&#xD;
plunge into a swamp from which you&#xD;
find it difficult to extricate yt~urself.&#xD;
This is the reason that horse-back rid-&#xD;
lag is so universally in vogue in all&#xD;
of the southern and western states.&#xD;
The two riders continued in the&#xD;
narrow path, their way becoming&#xD;
mere and more 'tangled, till at length&#xD;
jhe thick brushwood and fallen trees&#xD;
prevented their further progress alto-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
At the suggestion of Mr. Duverne,&#xD;
they both' dismounted,- and tied their&#xD;
horses. "We are now,'? -said Mr.&#xD;
as they proceeded --through&#xD;
the narrow openings. "-sixteen miles&#xD;
from home.' It is neiirly night, and&#xD;
I am right glad that our place of des-&#xD;
tination is well nigh at hand. Mr.&#xD;
Horton, I am as you -know a slave- 1&#xD;
holder. The estate I now own is in-']&#xD;
herited from my father who ~was of&#xD;
French descent,; though born in Virgi-&#xD;
nia. Coming in this manner into pos-&#xD;
session of a-large'- fortuneMr. Horton -1&#xD;
what could I do? Itwouldnotbehuman 'I&#xD;
nature if a person would refuse such&#xD;
gifts,' and prefer t~ remain in absolute&#xD;
beggary; for, to tell the truth, I, al-&#xD;
though, a slave-owner, abhor the very&#xD;
n~ime of Slavery, and it is my firm re-&#xD;
solve to emancipate my slaves in' a&#xD;
few years, at' the 'longest. But ho! 1&#xD;
Here we are I"                - -&#xD;
And now they had arrived at a&#xD;
small log house, alu~ost hidden, from&#xD;
view by briars, underwood ai~d rocks, r&#xD;
It was a wild place, this spot. -Gi-&#xD;
gantic trees drifted by the 'lightening .1&#xD;
into countless eplhrt~s loomed up I&#xD;
against the cold sky.; Huge racks I&#xD;
covered with the teen moss of cantw. r&#xD;
&#xD;
ries projected over yawning precipi-&#xD;
ces, and the wildness of the scenery&#xD;
was indescribable. That' small hut so&#xD;
still-.with no signs of life-so fbi&#xD;
away from any human habitation&#xD;
seemed to be a fit place for the ao-&#xD;
complishment of nefarious designs.&#xD;
'4vMr. Duverne !" exclaimed the&#xD;
now alarmed school-teacher. "Why&#xD;
have you brought me to this place?&#xD;
I feel a presentiment of evil, and I&#xD;
think that we had better return."&#xD;
"We will see 1" replied- the Ken-&#xD;
tucky planter as he disappeared be-&#xD;
hjnd the mound in front of the cabin.&#xD;
In a few moments he. returned with&#xD;
something that resembled a human&#xD;
being. He was diminutive in stature,&#xD;
not more than four :~nd a half feet&#xD;
high-he was humpbacked-his legs&#xD;
bent in the shape ofbows-his head&#xD;
res9mbled. a bullet in shape-in ph~c~&#xD;
of eya lasbes, there' was a broad, red&#xD;
stripe 'upon - his eye lids-his nose&#xD;
seemed to have bean eaten off - by&#xD;

'his eyes were overspread with a glassy&#xD;

from the farm-houses. It was about.&#xD;

far away into the distance, seemed to&#xD;
unite with the sky. Our eyes were&#xD;

"Now, boys!" said the postmaster,&#xD;
mechanically, . folding up the letter.&#xD;
"Ndw, we have some clue to the&#xD;
one's who are the cause of the recent&#xD;
escapes. Harry is out of our reach,&#xD;

said the rest, and the party dispersed&#xD;
to carry out their nefari6ua designs.&#xD;
Aunt Polly had originally belonged&#xD;
to a Mr. O'Neil, a very humane man,&#xD;
who gave her the chance of PuTchas-&#xD;
ing her libertyfrom the ext*:means&#xD;
that she~ could lay by. Slowly, but&#xD;
surely, the little savings accumulated,&#xD;
and at the end of fort~r eight years,&#xD;
she joyfully proffered the desired sum I&#xD;
to 'her owner. It was accepted, and&#xD;
she was 6'ee ~the winds.&#xD;
She had been twice. married; but&#xD;
both of her husband's had died. -She&#xD;
had a son by her first,, called Anse;&#xD;
now aged eighteen who belonged to 1&#xD;
Squire Moody. Her other two, Tony 1&#xD;
andJanie, were as yet mere infants.&#xD;
'~Her son, Anse, had? built her a&#xD;
cabin in a little glen in the woods, at&#xD;
a short distance from town, and here c&#xD;
she had thought of passing her last m&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
da in quietude and happiness. Be-&#xD;
ing free, ,she sympathized with the&#xD;
poor slave, and Anse, also had per-&#xD;
mitted fugitives on several occasions&#xD;
to remain harbored in the house of&#xD;
his mother.&#xD;
On the day following, as Old Aunt&#xD;
Polly. was seated in the door, with&#xD;
the little ones playing at her feet, she&#xD;
was surprised to see Constable Sliy-&#xD;
der approaching her, accompanied by&#xD;
two assistants.&#xD;
"How is you, Massa Snyder I"&#xD;
said the old negresswith 'her usual&#xD;
pleasant smile, and~. brushing down&#xD;
her apron as she arose from her&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
The ster~i officer was a man of few&#xD;
words arid without heeding her greet.&#xD;
ing, he replied. "Aunt Folly, piok&#xD;
up your duds, and ~bllow me, for you&#xD;
are to be sold to-morrow at lime&#xD;
o'clock. So make haste I"&#xD;
The flice of the negress changed&#xD;
from its blackness to a lighter shade;&#xD;
and pressing her hands against hey-&#xD;
temples asif to prevent their burst-&#xD;
in~, she staggered against the door-&#xD;
post, while a deep groan echoed&#xD;
from the depths of her very soul.&#xD;
~(She wa&amp;amp; to be sold I Again was&#xD;

Mechanically the negress gathered&#xD;
up her two infants, and followed them,&#xD;
ihe uttered not a word but there was'&#xD;
a look of such utter despair-such en-&#xD;
tire hopelessness depicted upoii every&#xD;
lineament, that it seemed 'as if the&#xD;
sunshinee of life had vanished from her&#xD;
forever, and in its place was substi-&#xD;

.o~lcers were at ~a great distance&#xD;
ahead, for they~had calculated 'upon&#xD;

As the bridge was neared, a sinister&#xD;
smile played upon her features. The&#xD;

BLACK ANsE. was seate&amp;amp; beneath&#xD;
the old elm, in front of his rna~ter's&#xD;
(Squire Moody's) house, playing on&#xD;
his fiddle th5se plaintive tunes, known&#xD;
only by the southern slaves. 'Three&#xD;
or four slaves were standing around,&#xD;
and their dark lineament. were illum-&#xD;
ed with joy, as some. rich notes more&#xD;
&#xD;
melodious than the ~rst would en&#xD;
chain their untutored ininda.&#xD;
"Boys!" at length said Anse, rest-&#xD;
ing his violin upon his knee. "Boys,&#xD;
de tunes don't come out ob dis ole&#xD;
feller as dey used did. I doesn't&#xD;
know de reason; but when I plays,&#xD;
now I feel berry bad,' and de nigga&#xD;
cries! Cries, 'kase dar's no one cares&#xD;

But' 'I'll play now, de 'farew~ill to my&#xD;
ole Kentucky home 1"&#xD;
"Anse!" echoed a deep voice be-&#xD;
hind him. "Anse, put up your fid-&#xD;
dle, and follow 'me." An~e obeyed,&#xD;
and soon they arrived at the public&#xD;
whipping-post; where a large crowd I&#xD;
was assembled. "Ause 1" said the 4&#xD;
Squire-" here is a~lette'r from Black&#xD;
Harry, written to you, in which, it&#xD;
appears,. that you have giveu aid to&#xD;

An attendant then chaiiiedi him to .e&#xD;

Squire Moody, taking the short, 'thick I&#xD;
whip, stepped back a fe~ $ces, ana ~&#xD;

the air brought the ini~'~f'tor- S&#xD;
ture with great might ~p~ni'the ne- fi&#xD;
groes flesh. 'l~he first blow raised- a h&#xD;
high dark ridge, extending from the ix&#xD;
top of the right shoulder to the hot- o'&#xD;
torn of the left, '&#xD;
The next blow left a ridge that o~&#xD;
crossed the other diagonally, axid at 'b&#xD;
their junction wher&amp;amp; the skin iviis r~&#xD;
broken, a thick, red spray of blood .0&#xD;
streanied. forth. Thus the terrible T&#xD;
lash dt~seended. It was x~ow drench-&#xD;
ed and dripping with gore. The back ti:&#xD;
of the negro was literally cut to pie- in&#xD;
ces, large pieces of flesh projecting tli&#xD;
outward-congealed and liquid blood pi&#xD;
&#xD;
was bubbling up, as if in anger at&#xD;
this terrible punishment. Not a&#xD;
groan escaped the compressed lips of&#xD;
the suffering, slave. At length, fa-&#xD;
tigued with his exertions, the Squire&#xD;
handed the whip to a by-stander to&#xD;
finish the remaining twenty lashes.-&#xD;
This Aew executioner rained down his&#xD;
he~ry blows with increased vigor up-&#xD;
on the quivering fie~h, every time,&#xD;
bringing away clinging particles. Once,&#xD;
and only once, 'did a low moan es-&#xD;
cape Anse. It was when a piece Qf&#xD;
his body was torn from the verybone,&#xD;

he died-the 'noble, the brave, and&#xD;

The next day he was buried. And'&#xD;
there were tears shed above his grave&#xD;
by many, for well did he deserve'&#xD;
them. (Ancient history tells us of a&#xD;
warrior who died, and whose lifeless&#xD;
body was left dis-entombed on the&#xD;
arid plains; but the winds sprung up,&#xD;
and heaped above his form, a mound&#xD;
of sand, from 'which palm- trees and&#xD;
bright flowers grew forth. A spring'&#xD;
of water also gushed up.&#xD;
And at this oasis the tired caravan&#xD;
paused. The weary camels quenched&#xD;
their thirst, the traders refreshed&#xD;
themselves, and performed their mys-&#xD;
terious religious, rites beneath the&#xD;
spreading shade. Though the grave&#xD;
of the "down-trodden" was not form-&#xD;
ed like that, yet it was suited to its&#xD;
occupant as well. It was in a quiet&#xD;
nook, where tall trees towered upward&#xD;

Mr. Duverne immediately ~rushed&#xD;

"You scoundrel I" burst from his lips,&#xD;
and with a powerful blow of his clench-&#xD;

He slowly arose, and seizing the&#xD;
hoe-handle, he glared silently, and ter&#xD;

he was about to smite him to the&#xD;

fellow, and for the sake of a few pie-&#xD;
ces of paltry gold, dooming him .to a&#xD;
life of misery, I vow that it is horri-&#xD;
ble. It seems so much like, bidding&#xD;
defiance to the Almighty; selling that&#xD;
which belongs to him exclusively. If&#xD;
you have stood by as I have done,&#xD;
day after day, witnessing this horrible&#xD;
trafic. If you have seen the agony&#xD;
depicted upon the faces of the doom-.&#xD;
ed ones, you will not say that the&#xD;
slave has no feelings-you will not&#xD;
say that his sensibilities are hardened&#xD;
-that hehas no affections. I declare&#xD;
that I have 'seen more heart-felt&#xD;
sorrow-more real anguish displayed&#xD;
frequently by 'the "down trodden"&#xD;
than I ever have among the most&#xD;
civilized of earth's other white inhab-&#xD;
itants.&#xD;
It's a horrible trade, this-this same&#xD;
"slave trafic." And I wonder who&#xD;
will be the most to blame at the final&#xD;
judgement-the slave-dealer, or the&#xD;
slave-buyer-the rum-seller or the&#xD;
ruu3-buyer.- Will they not both be&#xD;

no cares, that theirs-is a life of hap-:&#xD;
piness, when contrasted with the ex-&#xD;
treme poverty of the free negroes.&#xD;
&#xD;
But it will not do-I say it will not&#xD;
do.' It is a damning curse, and those&#xD;
who advocate slavery, know it. * We  -&#xD;
know it. It' is against the laws of&#xD;
reason and conscience.&#xD;
We enslave them because they are&#xD;
of a darker shade than. ourselves.&#xD;
Because God has not given them our .&#xD;
advantages, we trample upon them. I&#xD;
Thepe are the reasons. -&#xD;
Our striped flag, waving its tri-&#xD;
,umphant folds from every nook of&#xD;
the habitable globe, and sweeping&#xD;
with the storm-clouds above the&#xD;

Yes I if 'every blood red stripes upon&#xD;

talk about the mild form of your&#xD;
&#xD;
slavery! I warn yotr friends of hu-&#xD;
manity to beware of this mild form&#xD;
of slavery. It is this that will prolong&#xD;
the curse. The punishments may in&#xD;
time become less severe, the "traffic"&#xD;
may eventually cease. But does this&#xD;
suffice? No 1 It must be swept&#xD;
from our land. The motto of our&#xD;
ancestors was "the rights to take a&#xD;
pound, implies the right to take a&#xD;
thousand." So with Slavery I The&#xD;
right to enslave mildly implies the right&#xD;
to enslave severely. The latter method&#xD;
of enslavement will always continue&#xD;
the most in vogue, if we judge the&#xD;
future by the past.&#xD;
It will not do to d~nive men into&#xD;
measures. Insita hominibus nature&#xD;
vio1enti~u resisters. There are many&#xD;
h&amp;amp;-headed persons throughout the&#xD;
country who puff, and speak, and ad-&#xD;
vocate x~asures, but the moment you&#xD;
call upon them to make a sacrifice.-.-.&#xD;
the moment you touch their pockets,&#xD;
why like Bob Acres, their "courage&#xD;
oozes out at their finger ends." They~&#xD;
will not beard the lion in his den..&#xD;
No I not they. Now such men do&#xD;
more harm to a cause than good.&#xD;
Although I am for the extinction of&#xD;
slaver , yet I hold not to the doc-&#xD;
trines of compulsion, ~whether it~ the&#xD;
ansetment of laws or in the execution&#xD;
~f measures, because I think~ that such&#xD;
ancroaohments upon established privib&#xD;
leges tend to retard rather than to&#xD;
progress. We must use moral suasion.&#xD;
We mffst set good examples. We&#xD;
nust use the agency of religion, and&#xD;

&#xD;
We look, around at the crowded gal-&#xD;
leries, then at the august representa-&#xD;
tives of~ a nations power. All is si-&#xD;
lence, savethe low hum of many voices.&#xD;
At length the" hammer calls to or-&#xD;
der. Now a tall, and aged man slow-&#xD;
ly raises from his seat. He looks up~&#xD;
on the attentive crowd, and his deep&#xD;
voice echoes-" Mr. Speaker." What&#xD;
a breathless stillness falls upon the au-&#xD;
ditory? Hew their very souls seem&#xD;
to be riveted upon the subject? What&#xD;
i&amp;amp; the cause of this attentiveness. I&#xD;
will tell you.&#xD;
But yesterday a handbill was post-&#xD;
ed up in themarket place, announcing&#xD;
that one Henry Clay-a man fresh&#xD;
from the wilds of Kentucky, who was&#xD;
formerly "The Mill-Boy of the Slash-&#xD;
es," was to speak ~n the subject of&#xD;
Slavery Compromise in the Senate.&#xD;
Why,~ this excitement, then? Why&#xD;
did multitudes pause suddenly in the&#xD;
street, and gaze upon those flaming&#xD;
characters V Why did eome knit&#xD;
their brows, and compress their~ lips,&#xD;
hissing-" the Abolitionists-the most&#xD;
villan~us of sIb-the vile Abolition-&#xD;
because a furious faction was&#xD;
~"the nation to its very centre&#xD;
and arrayed against each other, were&#xD;
the frierijis ofLiberty, and the adhe-&#xD;
rents of Slavery.&#xD;
So, ott this day, they had swsem-&#xD;
bled to hear the words which fellfropi&#xD;
the lips of the "backwoods orator."&#xD;
Ai~d why had his sentencessuch pow-&#xD;
er. Thereason was, that they came&#xD;
spontaneously from the ~ieart-..they&#xD;
were.nol4inged with affectation-.--they'&#xD;
were the eu~ouriuga of Nature&#xD;
A~ain he spoke. "Mr. Speaker,&#xD;
this is an eventful day. The transac-&#xD;
tions of this day will be recorded in&#xD;
our national historyand be handed&#xD;
down toftiture posterity." ~Thus he&#xD;
commenced, and his spiriV~' soared&#xD;
into ut~explored mazes of"~rofound&#xD;
knowledge. Metaphar, simile, and&#xD;
&#xD;
syllogism came to his aid, and for&#xD;
three long hours he seemed .insensi~~&#xD;
blc to all around. At last amid&#xD;
thunders of applause he resumed his&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
He was followed by the youngest&#xD;
senator in the house, Charles Ather-&#xD;
ton, the author. He had been re-&#xD;
cently elected, and on this occasion he&#xD;
was to make his debut.&#xD;
As there always is on such occa-&#xD;
sions, the greatest curiosity prevailed&#xD;
to learn what his views were.&#xD;
His manners and actions were* at&#xD;
first so awkward, that an involuntary&#xD;
titter ran through the crowd of spec-&#xD;
tatora; l~'ut as he proceeded he warm-&#xD;
ed with. his subject. Then the sweat&#xD;
stood in huge globules upon his highr&#xD;
white forehead-his blue eye darted&#xD;
around like lightning-his'~estures&#xD;
becax~e as graceful as the waving wil-&#xD;
low, and his sad silvery voice had a&#xD;
magic spelt which bound the heart.&#xD;
He became ~rancendentally eloquent.&#xD;
Worjls, sciences, politics, and laws&#xD;
were but stepping stones-he went&#xD;
further. His vigorousintellect went&#xD;
forth, and dwelt among new theo-&#xD;
rems, biased "on "~JogicaI deductions,&#xD;
and poised with undiscovered si~ns&#xD;
and prophecies, the existence of which&#xD;
had before been doubted~ His rea-&#xD;
sonings were conclusive, and every&#xD;
hypothesis tenabld.&#xD;
The audience were spell-bound.&#xD;
Astonishment was depicted in every&#xD;
feature. It was so silent that you&#xD;
might have heard the beatings of&#xD;
many hearts-it was painful to breath.&#xD;
Still those silvery cadences seemed&#xD;
to come and melt away to the ear&#xD;
like .&amp;amp;liau Symphonies. They satr&#xD;
the p~or bleeding slave as he was-&#xD;
they saw the infuriated overseer in&#xD;
his most diabolical colors..-..they saw&#xD;
the gross darkness ~ which pervades&#xD;
the mind of man in relation to Slave-&#xD;
ry. Yes! I say that they saw these&#xD;
things, and it was &amp;amp;n arrow U con-&#xD;
&#xD;
eviction piercing to their ~ouls And&#xD;
there were slave-holders there-men,&#xD;
rough, stern, and unfeeling who wept&#xD;
when they heard the cruelties which&#xD;
they themselves had often perpetra-&#xD;
ted as described by Senator Ather-&#xD;
ton.&#xD;
When ~the speaker had ended, no&#xD;
shouts of applause greeted his ears.&#xD;
There was no occasion Tor any-the&#xD;
subject was too dee p -too soleinn.-&#xD;
But whkihever way he turned, tearful&#xD;
eyes met his gaze, and low sighs came&#xD;
soft upon his ears from those "fair&#xD;
ones" who are averse to all chains ex-&#xD;
cept the ones which they throw around&#xD;
the "lords of creation."&#xD;
Atherton's triumph was complete,&#xD;
and though ~sfte"rwards obnoxious laws&#xD;
were passed, yet" many things which&#xD;
would haverendered them still more&#xD;
odious were rejected through the in-&#xD;
fluence of the Abolition speaker.&#xD;

ABOUT this time, a child was born&#xD;

for a time in my solicitude for the lit-&#xD;
tle stranger, I forgot my many woes.&#xD;
Day after day, she grew apace, and~&#xD;
her features were the exact counter-&#xD;
part of hermother's, regular and beau-&#xD;

was a gentle child. Poor little slave.&#xD;
I thanked God that he implanted in-&#xD;
fantile unconsciousness within her&#xD;
breast so that she saw not the misery&#xD;
in store for her future years.&#xD;
On the bright Sabbath mornings, I&#xD;
always hastened to the cabin of Fi-&#xD;
dole. Then with little Zilly in icy&#xD;
arms, I would walk to the green shade~&#xD;
by the crystal waters of "the little&#xD;
creek, and then I was happy. Hap.&#xD;

On~ day, I called as usual, and was&#xD;
surprised to find little Zilly in a burn-&#xD;

sufferer fell into a. gentle' slumber, and&#xD;
with my heart filled with the hope of&#xD;
her speedy recovery, I retui~ned to the&#xD;
plantation The' first person that I&#xD;
saw was the overseer; a cloud had&#xD;
gt~thered upon his brow. "Nelse, you&#xD;
rascal where have you been-how did&#xD;
you dare to remain out overnight?"&#xD;
"My child was ill, and I thought to&#xD;
watch by its side."&#xD;
"Tending your black brat. 'Well,&#xD;
that's a pretty story. If the thing&#xD;
wants to die, who cares&#xD;
"I care I" I replied firmly.'&#xD;

I seized a~small board, and.atru,~k him&#xD;
to the ground, where he lay br some&#xD;
time insensible.&#xD;
The whole circle now sallied out,&#xD;
and I was beund hand and foot. I&#xD;
had committed an unpardonable sin,&#xD;
according to the views of my oppres-&#xD;

chills like crawling serpents caine up-&#xD;
on my hack. Then again I would set&#xD;
for entire days without having the&#xD;

and obscured. God, knows how I&#xD;
ever regained my reason, I do not.-&#xD;

After remaining at the "J~'alls" for&#xD;
some time~ they left for Saratoga, to&#xD;
participate in its giddy pleasures-to&#xD;
swill down champagne, and to flutter&#xD;
around the blaze of fashion.&#xD;
Among the visitors, was one Col.&#xD;
Sanford, a wealthy planter who resi-&#xD;
ded at New-Orleans. He became ac-&#xD;

by' him introduced to his daughter&#xD;
(unnat~iral daughter) Ada. Her e~c-&#xD;

Southerner, and he became her con-&#xD;

remained in the city two months, at-&#xD;

formed Mr. Duverne that he had ob-&#xD;
tained the consent of his daughter, and&#xD;
if he would. acquiesce the marriage&#xD;
ceremonies would immediately take&#xD;
place. The consent was given, and&#xD;
the day fixed,. It was rumored through-&#xD;
out the fashionable circles that the&#xD;
rich Col. Sanford was soon to be~ uni-&#xD;
ted to the lovely brunette who had&#xD;
caused such a sensation.&#xD;
The night at length came. The&#xD;
wedding was to be consummated ~t the&#xD;
princely mansion of Mr. Archer No.&#xD;
~O Franklin Square. The rooms were&#xD;
filled to overflowing with invited&#xD;
guests. Lights were flashing-around&#xD;
music gave forth its sweetest strains,&#xD;
and costly perfumes were wafted&#xD;
through the apartments. And there&#xD;
were women, beautiful as a dream,&#xD;
their. silvery laugh rhiging out as clear&#xD;
asif they hadnever known a day of sor-&#xD;
row. Men, too-men ehiyalrous, and&#xD;
handsome.&#xD;
The couple stood up to be united.&#xD;
And now a death-like stillness fell up-&#xD;
on the assemblage, all eyes were di-&#xD;
recf~ed toward the splendid pair. And&#xD;
Ada-Oh, she was wondrously, sur-&#xD;
passingly b tiful. ~Never w~s being&#xD;
so lovely be . The clear blood man-&#xD;
tled her dark cheek-her hair fell&#xD;

glorious ringlets-her large, midnight&#xD;
eyes shone lustrously, and her bosom&#xD;
swelled like ~ heaving wave of the&#xD;
ocean-she appeared to be so happy.&#xD;
Her dress was of white satin, and she&#xD;
was decorated profusely with jewelry.&#xD;
And at that hour-when~ a deep&#xD;
stillness was around, and solemnity&#xD;

heard in the hall, and the door was&#xD;
4P~&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
burst open while a being entered.-&#xD;
This being was a negress! She was&#xD;
so old, that her crisped hair was as&#xD;
white as the driven snow. Her flesh&#xD;
hung in folds upon her stiffened bones&#xD;
-her upturned eyes revealed a horri-&#xD;
ble ~vhite, and her grinning teeth&#xD;
chattered together. The company&#xD;
stood mute as if the "Witch of En-&#xD;
dor" was before them. "I've trabelled&#xD;
all de w~y from Ole Birgiany to come&#xD;
hero. Ohwa I ohwa I" And her&#xD;
loud, shrill voice struck a chill to ev-&#xD;
ery heart, but no person stirred.&#xD;
"Yes,~~ said she, "ye're a fine gem-&#xD;
men. Ye's want to marry my daugh-&#xD;

And the loathsome creature 4proach-&#xD;

brow. The bride fell insensible to the&#xD;
floor, and the old negresa disappear-&#xD;
ed. The company robbed their eyes&#xD;
as if they doubted their senses; but&#xD;
when they looked around, she was&#xD;
gone.&#xD;
Au universal shriek of horror re-&#xD;
sounded through . the apartments.-.-&#xD;
The bridegroom stood transfixed to&#xD;
the floor, his whole form quivering&#xD;
like an aspen leaf, his eyes glowing&#xD;
beneath his shaggy brow like living&#xD;
coals. "Incarnate fiend I" burst&#xD;
from his lips---" Demon, what dam..&#xD;
fling contrivance impelled you to palm,&#xD;
off you foul offspring-the child of&#xD;
a negress upon me. Deceiver I Take&#xD;

him fled from the house.&#xD;
This was &amp;amp; tragic conclusion. Some&#xD;
of the party swooned away-others&#xD;
were carried out screaming, and all&#xD;
was confusion.&#xD;
A few gathered around the wound-&#xD;
ed man. He opened his eyes. "H6r-&#xD;

and he was conveyed to his hotel.-&#xD;
The wound wan severe, but not fatal,&#xD;
for the bullet had taken a. dowawar4&#xD;
course, and lodged against the hi~&#xD;
bone. For three months and a hal,&#xD;
he was confined 'to his room, and the&#xD;
agojiy he suffered was great. Verni,&#xD;
in the meantime had departed for&#xD;
Kentucky,' but Ada remained.&#xD;
Spring was now at hand, and Mt.&#xD;
Duverne was impatient to proceed&#xD;
home. According y, they proceeded&#xD;
to Hnrrisburgh, by railroad, and then&#xD;
to2k a stage coach to finish another&#xD;
part of their journey. For six days&#xD;
they had passed through the beautiful&#xD;
scenery, and rough crags which are&#xD;
found on the high mountainsof the&#xD;
Key Stone state.&#xD;
It was a cold, blustery day in March&#xD;
that the coach stopped at a little inn&#xD;
on the summit of the Alleghanies. It&#xD;
was a very old building, and its crazy&#xD;
shutters slammed violently to and fro,&#xD;

Morning.at length broke. l3utit&#xD;

was one broad illimitable sheet of fire,&#xD;

commingled with the ~creams of&#xD;
strange birds.&#xD;
When Mr. Duverne recovered his&#xD;

the recollection of his night ride&#xD;
crossed his mind, he 'shuddered..-&#xD;
Full one hundred feet high was the&#xD;
precipice, and' it extended for miles&#xD;

asleep; her, rest was so calm so gentle.&#xD;
Her head rested upon her arm, a&#xD;
few glossy curls swept across her up-&#xD;
turned face, her eyes were closed, and&#xD;
a sweet, soft smile enwreathed her&#xD;
mouth. Could, this be death I (I&#xD;

&#xD;
BLACK BLOOT&#xD;
Well, as I said, she was sold to a&#xD;
planter in Old Virginny. Shn man-&#xD;
aged to escape after remaining in his&#xD;
service awhile. Since that time she&#xD;
has wandered amid the fastnesses of&#xD;
the Alleghanies, and her horrible ap-&#xD;
pearance, together with the truthful-&#xD;
ncs~ of her prcdi~tions soon obtained&#xD;
for her the cognomen of" The Witch&#xD;
of the Alleghanies2' Well as I re-&#xD;
peat it ;' two years ago at night she&#xD;
staid 'with us. She wa~ journeying to&#xD;
Philadelphia to prevent a marriage be-&#xD;
tween her daughter (whom Duverne&#xD;
had adopted as his own,) and a wealthy&#xD;
Southerner. She left us, and since&#xD;
that I have not seen anything of her&#xD;
till to-day.&#xD;
For three days they rode along in&#xD;
the coach. At the end of that time&#xD;
their course was obstructed, for sever-&#xD;
s.1 bridges had been torn away by&#xD;
late freshets, consequently they were&#xD;
obliged to perform a journey of nine-&#xD;
ty-six miles on foot, before they could&#xD;
reach the next stage connection.&#xD;
It was a perilous undertaking, this.&#xD;
At Qne time swimming deep and rap-&#xD;
id rivers, then traversing extensive&#xD;
swamps and pathless forests, then&#xD;
wandering over high hills and' level&#xD;
plains, the route seemed long and&#xD;
toilsome. And what must have been&#xD;
the feelings of the slave-holder when&#xD;
he thought that he ~as in the power&#xD;
of' a savage foe, to whom the least&#xD;
disclosure concerning himself might&#xD;
be attended with fatal consequences.&#xD;
The planter at once in the recesses&#xD;
of his dark mind, resolved upon tak-&#xD;
ing the, life of his companion at the&#xD;
first opportunity which might offer.&#xD;
But Spunk was an old hunter-wary,&#xD;
and ever on the alert, therefore the&#xD;
designs of the slave-holder were frus-&#xD;
trated.&#xD;
About noon-time, on the 12th day&#xD;
of their journey, they came in sight&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A N&#xD;
AND WHITE.                    ~71&#xD;
of Weeping, with its spires, domes,&#xD;
and painted roofs glittering in the&#xD;
burnished rays of the sun.&#xD;
Here they obtained passage in the&#xD;
mail steamer connection from Wheel-&#xD;
ing to Pittsburgh.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
LIGHT AND SHADE.&#xD;
THIRA FAIRCHILD proceeded to&#xD;
Fraukfort; but her petitions were now&#xD;
disregarded, for this second trespass of&#xD;
her father had debared him from ex-&#xD;
ecutive clemency.&#xD;
She returned to her home. It was&#xD;
now noticed by all, that a change had&#xD;
come over the minister's cottage.&#xD;
The-smoke no longer curled from the&#xD;
stone chimney, the shutters were&#xD;
closed and solitude reigned unclisturb-&#xD;
ed. The hovers #ere neglected, and&#xD;
weeds choked up the delicate plants.&#xD;
Thira was very rarely seen, or if seen,&#xD;
it was but for an instant for she im-&#xD;
mediately retired.&#xD;
The time of her meeting~ Pur-&#xD;
ceval Maturiz~ had now arrived. '1~ut&#xD;
it was now winter-eold, blustering&#xD;
winter. Snows were upon the earth&#xD;
and tempests came forth from their&#xD;
hidden lairs.&#xD;
Night came on apace, and the little&#xD;
cot shook to~ its very foundation, as&#xD;
the winds shrieked past. A thousand&#xD;
times had Thira resolved to fulfil her&#xD;
promise, and as 'many times Aid she&#xD;
hesitate~ At last "Friendship, Lover&#xD;
a~d Truth," triumphed over every&#xD;
other consideration, and hastily put..&#xD;
ting on her shawl and bonnet she sal-&#xD;
lied out.&#xD;
The pierceing blast cut like needles&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7787-00000037"/>&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
against her flesh, and the cold drift-&#xD;
ing slows were wafted full into her&#xD;
face. Onward she went, heedless of&#xD;
the storm without, f~r a ~atorm was&#xD;
raging within her, soul-4he conflict&#xD;
between love, aud duty.&#xD;
She reached the old gray tree.&#xD;
Nothing was to be seen. The dry&#xD;
branches groaned, and it seemed as&#xD;
if fiends were mocking her from the&#xD;
tree-tops.&#xD;
Was Maturin false.-.or had she&#xD;
come too late?&#xD;
it *as now midnight. The fury&#xD;
of the elements had abated, and no&#xD;
sound broke the solemn stillness save&#xD;
the continual fall-fall-falling of&#xD;
snow flakes.&#xD;
Suddenly a faint groan was borne&#xD;
upon her ~ar. Her heart panted like&#xD;
a hammer: she peered with distend-"&#xD;
ed eyes through the gloom. All was&#xD;
still I She saw nothing.&#xD;
Again she stood motionless as a&#xD;
statue listening forth repetitionof that&#xD;
sound. The light flakes fell upon her&#xD;
brow an4 dissolved,~Heurs passed on,&#xD;
and though she'was perishing with&#xD;
the cold, an enchainment bound her&#xD;
to the spot.&#xD;
The thought that Maturin might&#xD;
be dying a~nid the snows aroused her.&#xD;
His piety, his devotion, his love for&#xD;
hererossed her mind. Then the feel-&#xD;
ingn of her soul which had been pent&#xD;
up for years, burst forth, and in a mo-&#xD;
ment she knew ho~ madly she loved.&#xD;
She cried, and her voice resounded&#xD;
far over the dreary waste, 'Turce-&#xD;
vaL"&#xD;
r Ah, that word brought a response.&#xD;
A low, smothered moan followed.-&#xD;
Thira flew to the place from which the&#xD;
sound proceeded, and there iay, half&#xD;
buried in the snowy a dark object.&#xD;
"Purceval l~' she shrieked.&#xD;
No answer met her ear. She felt&#xD;
his face..-~it was like ice. His' pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
beat not, and his limbs were frozen&#xD;
stiff.&#xD;
"Oh, God I" she cried, as she stag-&#xD;
gered backwards, "I have killed him.&#xD;
But I will not leave him, I will perish&#xD;
byliis side! No, he may. still live.&#xD;
I will save him."&#xD;
So saying, ~he raised him from his&#xD;
freezing bed, and being sustained by&#xD;
hope, bore him, after great exertion;&#xD;
to the cottage.&#xD;
She laid him upon a bed before the&#xD;
blazing fire, bathing his forehead. with&#xD;
camphor, and chafing his limbs.-&#xD;
Her efforts were successful, and to-&#xD;
wards morning the sufferer 'opened&#xD;
his eyes. He gazed around him ab-&#xD;
stractedly., "Oh, this horrible dream.&#xD;
Am I in the land of spirits I"&#xD;
With a cry of joy Thira rushed to&#xD;
his side, and was ~nclasped in his&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
In a few days the young minister&#xD;
was able to walk about. When he&#xD;
had sufficiently recovered, she ques-&#xD;
tioned him.&#xD;
"Yes, Thira," he answered, "I had&#xD;
wandered miles that day amid the&#xD;
whirling snows, and night fall found&#xD;
me beneath the trysting tree. You&#xD;
came not. I thought that you would&#xD;
appear in time, and hope still linger~&#xD;
ed within my breast. But when the&#xD;
long hours had merged into midnight,&#xD;
then indeed did I despair. Chilled,&#xD;
and benumbed, I sank upon the&#xD;
ground. A feeling of drowsiness came&#xD;
over me, and I dreamed. Scenes,&#xD;
brigl4 and beautiful, rose before me,&#xD;
and then I saw you, TEira, holy and&#xD;
lovely, as when you first burst upon&#xD;
my sight. And then came thoughts&#xD;
of my Hoosier hcine, a father and&#xD;
mother awaiting my return. Then&#xD;
there came a blank, a dull monotony;&#xD;
I felt myself to be dying; yet it was&#xD;
easy dying, so calm, so painless. I,&#xD;
felt happy. Then the thought of&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DGWN-TROI}DEN; OR,                              BLACK BLOOD AND WI~ITE.&#xD;
&#xD;
your seeming unfaithfulness, caused&#xD;
me to groan. Shortly aftet, I beard&#xD;
your voice; but it was too late, dark-&#xD;
ness was around me, and I knew no&#xD;
more. Now, Thira, you have my&#xD;
story, and certainly now, you will not&#xD;
refuse me y~ur hand.&#xD;
She answered, "Purceral. I had&#xD;
resolved never to wed. B~ut ziow~ my&#xD;
father is incarcerated in the ~looiny&#xD;
dungeons of Kentucky. He is dead&#xD;
to me now, for I know that he will&#xD;
not long a~irvive..--death will soon re-&#xD;
lieve him of his 8ufferings. I have&#xD;
loved you, Purceval-loved you long,&#xD;
and now I am yours-.-yours forever."&#xD;
W~will~a8s over the rest. 5i4-&#xD;
fice it is to say that the lovers were&#xD;
united. Happiness attended their&#xD;
steps-.-religion diffused a benign&#xD;
renity-.--love entwined their heart~, and&#xD;
the only alloy to their felicity was&#xD;
the doom of Thira's father.&#xD;
For aught, we know they still live&#xD;
in the little einbowered cottage. The&#xD;
flowers still bloom as sweet-.--pweeter&#xD;
perhaps than before-and the warm,&#xD;
yellow sun shines down as in days of&#xD;
yore upon Indiana-.beautifuj Hoosir&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
JnRRY.-NSL53.~THE ESCAPES&#xD;
ASOUT this time, my brother Jerry&#xD;
escaped from his master, and arrived&#xD;
safely at the land of freedom.-Can-&#xD;
ada.&#xD;
But in his new situation he was not&#xD;
contented, and he left, Toronto for Sy-&#xD;
racuse. Here he remained for some&#xD;
time; but b1~ed-hounds were on the&#xD;
scent, and he was one morningg sud-&#xD;
&#xD;
denly arrested by the slave-holder, and&#xD;
his friends-the police&#xD;
He was conveyed to the court-room,&#xD;
but in the meantime the crowd had&#xD;
become so immense that the'court&#xD;
found it necessary to retire to other&#xD;
quarters; and now came the "tug of&#xD;
war." One vast, mighty shout came&#xD;
up from that surging multitude-'&#xD;
"Save him .Save him."&#xD;
In vain did the officers of the law&#xD;
resist; Marshall Fitch, of Rochester,&#xD;
had his ,a~i broken ii~ the melee.-.&#xD;
The fugitive was forcibly torn away,&#xD;
and conveyed t~ a place of saTety.-&#xD;
He was rescued.&#xD;
The intelligence of my brother's&#xD;
escape animated me anew, and in the&#xD;
depths of my heart, I resolved to em-&#xD;
brace the first opportunity and fl~r&#xD;
also. But how was this to be acconi-&#xD;
pUshed. Mile; hundreds ot' miles in-&#xD;
tervened. The pathless forest-.the&#xD;
spreading Savanna-the broad" irie&#xD;
were between; and then with the en-&#xD;
cumbrance of my wife and child I It&#xD;
was 'a. difficult task; "but 'it mum be&#xD;
done-death were preferable to slavery.&#xD;
I communicated my thoughts and&#xD;
intentions to Fidele. She acquiesced&#xD;
to the proposals.&#xD;
So one dark, starless ni~ht, whew&#xD;
the cold winds sung a requiem tothe.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIL&#xD;
*            CONCLUSION.&#xD;
Wu left Spunk and Mr. Duverne on&#xD;
the steamer.&#xD;
It was now near the hour of mid-&#xD;
night, and' the two, after conversing&#xD;
- confidentially, Went below to view the&#xD;
huge glowing furnaces. This oc~u-&#xD;
pied them for some time.&#xD;
Presently the hunter went to the&#xD;
rear of the boat; the planter follQw-&#xD;
ed-a thought flashed across his&#xD;
mind. It was but the work of an in-&#xD;
~tant to push the backwoodsman&#xD;
through the open space of railing. It&#xD;
w~s done.&#xD;
The man clutched on the guards of&#xD;
the boat, his face was turned npwa~'d,&#xD;
and on it was depicted baffled venge2&#xD;
ance intense hate, despair, and horror;&#xD;
"Do you know who I am I" said the&#xD;
planter in a deep, low voice, "I am&#xD;
Ichabold Duverne, the father. of Ver-&#xD;
ni."&#xD;
The huge form of the poor wretch&#xD;
quivered from head to foot, he raised&#xD;
himself partially up, but his hands&#xD;
were pushed off, and he disappeared&#xD;
from the light of. the furnaces, into&#xD;
the darkness below.&#xD;
At a short distance he arose, the&#xD;
reflection on the water revealed his&#xD;
blanched features upborne by the&#xD;
waves, and then he sank forever.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Duverne returned to the saloon'&#xD;
Here he found a party engaged in&#xD;
gambling. He joined them.&#xD;
Opposite to him, sat a young man&#xD;
whose features were nearly concealed&#xD;
by a broad rimmed, slouching hat.&#xD;
Stake after stake was swept away by&#xD;
him in spite of all the contrivances of&#xD;
his opponents. At midnight the game.&#xD;
ended, and the company 'arose from&#xD;
the table, having lost in all an enor-&#xD;
mous amount.&#xD;
The stranger pocketed his ill-gotten&#xD;
gains, and walked out upon the deck.&#xD;
It was starlight, and the. monoto-&#xD;
nous dipping of the wheels broke up-&#xD;
on the ear; on either side lay the dark&#xD;
forest banks of the Ohio.&#xD;
He looked upward at the half ob-&#xD;
scured moon, and listened to the moan-&#xD;
ing winds. He felt a hand laid upon&#xD;
his shoulder-a glittering stiletto&#xD;
flashed before his eyes.. He turniA.&#xD;
The dark, ferocious face of Duverne&#xD;
was turned upon him, embodying the&#xD;
hidden fires of despairing murder, and&#xD;
anger.&#xD;
"Give me the ten thousand dollars&#xD;
that you have won of me, or by&#xD;
Heaven, .this instant you die, as one&#xD;
has died by my means this night, alrea-&#xD;
'dy." said the planter, and his words&#xD;
fell low, but fearfully.&#xD;
The stranger flung his hat far away&#xD;
-shook back his long, matted locks,&#xD;
and laughed so ,wildly, so horribly,&#xD;
that its ringing peals smote upon the&#xD;
heart of the assailant with a strange,&#xD;
unknown, freezing power.&#xD;
"Die! Ha! ha! ha! And is&#xD;
that not ~hat I have been trying to&#xD;
do for . these* two years. Ha! ha I&#xD;
Die. Strike-strike here?' And he&#xD;
bared his bosom for the blow.&#xD;
The slave-holders arm fell nerveless&#xD;
by his side.&#xD;
"Ha! ha !" again broke' out that,&#xD;
loud, unseeming lAugh. "Do 'you&#xD;
&#xD;
know who I am? I am V'erni .Du-&#xD;
t'erne,~jour own son. The son of a&#xD;
blood-stained murderer, the destroyer&#xD;
of his fellow. And you say that you&#xD;
have murdered another this, very&#xD;
night. Who was it ?"&#xD;
"Spunk! Zorah I You I" gasped&#xD;
the father, and he trembled as with&#xD;
an ague fit.&#xD;
"I know it. Ha!' ha! Zorah! Oh,&#xD;
I see, thee now. Forgive !" and Ver-&#xD;
ni, the hardened bad man wept. His&#xD;
voice sank to a lower tone. "Father,&#xD;
take my low deep curse. It was you,&#xD;
that ruined jie. Yes! Once I was&#xD;
free from guilt, but what am I now?&#xD;
Answer me I I discovered your crimes&#xD;
-I found out whlit an unnatural parenL&#xD;
God had given. And in an instant the&#xD;
fountains of charity were frozen up&#xD;
forever in my soul, and my course has&#xD;
been a dark one ever since. I became&#xD;
old in 'vice in the flush of youth.&#xD;
Wherever there was a chance~I blast-&#xD;
ed the family hearthstone forever.-&#xD;
Wherever there was purity, I left the&#xD;
dark mildew of sin. If I found love,~&#xD;
happiness, and confidence, I left in its&#xD;
place, madness, despair, and reckless-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
And around this depraved, this&#xD;
loathsome mass of iniquity, I threw&#xD;
the net work of religion, purity, and&#xD;
generosity. I breathed into ~the ear&#xD;
of the good man, sentiments of ?hi~&#xD;
lanthropy, into that of his wife, ove&#xD;
and infidehty-~his meek-eyed daugh-&#xD;
ter listened to my honeyed words, and&#xD;
-fell-forever. And I laughed at&#xD;
the misery I inflicted. The spirit of&#xD;
the fiend was upon me. I cursed ev-&#xD;
ery thing below and abovsi. I stood&#xD;
amid the blackness of desolation, and&#xD;
bade the gray haired father's curse me,&#xD;
for it was sweet~nsic to my soul.&#xD;
I have long been a professed gam-&#xD;
bler, and luck has ever been on my&#xD;
side. But what is life to me, I have&#xD;
&#xD;
sought death in a thousand different&#xD;
forms, hut found it not You, my&#xD;
own father, swore that you would take&#xD;
my life a few moments ago. Now, I&#xD;
am ready. Gray headed fiend, take&#xD;
it, you' will meet with no resistance."&#xD;
There they both stood in the dark~&#xD;
some night, the father and son, glar-&#xD;
ing upon each other with deadly. hate.&#xD;
At length the father broke the si-&#xD;
lence, he echoed tremulously-" Ver-&#xD;
nil"&#xD;
The bosom of the gambler swelled&#xD;
with the pent up emotions of his soul.&#xD;
"Take thy gold."&#xD;
And he tore open his vest, and&#xD;
showered the metal around. It fell&#xD;
upon' the deck with a ringing sound.&#xD;
Then with a yell of madness, he&#xD;
started back a few paces, then sprang&#xD;
from the high deck into the air. A&#xD;
dull', heavy splash broke upon the ear,&#xD;
and Verni Duverne had met a watery&#xD;
grave.&#xD;
Then there wis the picture of the&#xD;
grey-headed father, straining his eyes&#xD;
through the night gloom as if to see&#xD;
his child again appear.&#xD;
The passengers hearing the noise,&#xD;
rushed out from the cabin, just in time&#xD;
to prevent the planter from following&#xD;
his son.&#xD;
He returned home. But he never&#xD;
spoke again. His pro erty was scat-&#xD;
tered to the winds, an4 to this day,&#xD;
he wanders noiseless, and friendless on&#xD;
earth-a sad realization of that awful&#xD;
saying, "Ven~eanc~ is mine, I will&#xD;
repay."&#xD;
The Tinkeys still continue in the&#xD;
enjoyment of health, and the posses-&#xD;
sion of the "darling babiess"&#xD;

Bertoldo, before he quits Sicily&#xD;
seeks an interview with Camiola to&#xD;
press his suit with her. We are first&#xD;
introduced to her accompanied by&#xD;
Signior Sylli, a mere vain fo~l, who&#xD;
seems to imagine that every woman&#xD;
that looks on him must dote on him.&#xD;
So satisfied is he of his own perfec-&#xD;
tions, that he has sworn never to take&#xD;
a wife who cannot hold out a month&#xD;
against him. The gentleness with&#xD;
which Camiola ~ndures his fantastic&#xD;
follies, is an earnest of the noble na-&#xD;
ture she displays in afl her future life.&#xD;
While she ispntiently listening to the&#xD;
warnings of her silly suitor, to be on&#xD;
her guard against his many perfec-&#xD;
tions, her waiting-woman informs her&#xD;
that Bertoldo, the brother of the king,&#xD;
craves an audience. He is a suitor of&#xD;
a different sort; for, although Signior&#xD;
Sylli feels no jealousy, confident that&#xD;
a woman who had once looked on&#xD;
him could never love another; yet&#xD;
we learn from Oamiola herself; that&#xD;
Bertoldo is a man "absolute and cir-&#xD;
cular in all those wished-for rairities&#xD;
that may take a virgin captive,"-a&#xD;
suitor, whose presence, courtship, and&#xD;
&#xD;

s though she owns, to herself; her love&#xD;
~, for him, her reason tells her she ought&#xD;
e neither to yield her love, nor seek'&#xD;

,, excuse it. Oamioi4' disturbe~at the&#xD;

- those which he enjoys here, where he&#xD;
is beth beloved and honored,-the&#xD;
north-star and guide of all hearts,-&#xD;
and where he holds so high a position&#xD;
as brother of the king? Bertoldo,&#xD;
* keeping out of sight, the fiery heat&#xD;
* with which he has urged on his en-&#xD;
* terpr~se, tells her that it is she who&#xD;
has driven him into exile~-that h~r&#xD;
unexampled cruelty has' enforced his&#xD;
absence, and deprived him of those&#xD;
blessings which she insinuated that&#xD;
he possessed; and yet she accuses&#xD;
him of rushing into wilful exile.-&#xD;
What are titles to him, he says" Or&#xD;
popular favor, or relationship to the&#xD;
crown ?-or what would it be even&#xD;
to be Sovereign of Sicily7 'is~heu she,&#xD;
who is the essence of his being, the&#xD;
anchor of his hopes, by her disdain&#xD;

ing shadows Camiola protests that&#xD;
he accuses her without cause. But&#xD;
Bertoldo still urges her to answer love&#xD;
with love, and to look on him with an&#xD;
eye of favor. damiola modestly c~ii-&#xD;
fesses her love for him, and says,, that&#xD;
if at that moment all the sceptred&#xD;
monarchs of the world were his rivals,&#xD;
and she worthy of such competition,&#xD;
he alone would carry off the prize.-&#xD;
But the consciousness of her own&#xD;
inferiorty 'prevented her indulging&#xD;
the love she felt. They were like&#xD;

&#xD;
divided lines, that could never meet&#xD;
in 'one centre. His birth alone was&#xD;
an am~1e dowry for one of fairer for-&#xD;
tunes; his personal appearance above&#xD;
'all value, elren if he were ignoble';&#xD;
and his mind- "so furnished with hay-&#xD;
mopious faculties, moulded from hea-&#xD;
von," that though he were of no hon-&#xD;
orablAeseent, as deformed in person&#xD;
as Thersites, and as beggared in for-&#xD;
tune as Irus, he still would force all&#xD;
to admire him. But all these quali-&#xD;
ties bound uptogether were far above&#xD;
h~r deserts; she only craves leave to&#xD;
look upon' them with admiration, but&#xD;
does not venture top resume she' may&#xD;
'enjoy them. Bertoldo interrupts her,&#xD;
to exclaim that he knows of no dis-&#xD;
parity between them: she is sprung&#xD;
from a noble family, fair, rich, young,&#xD;
---every 'way his equal.&#xD;
~ But Camiola is not to be flattered&#xD;
out of her sense of right: 'she holds&#xD;
that the eagle and thh wren cannot&#xD;
dwell in the same nest; that it is mon-&#xD;
strous to put tissue an freeze in the&#xD;
samegarment. "But," she goes on,&#xD;
"e~n if yonr perfection were dimin-&#xD;
ished, and my deserts increased, the&#xD;
strong bar of religion would oppose&#xD;
our union. You are a knight of&#xD;
Malta, bound by the holy vows of&#xD;
your order to a sin le life ; you can-&#xD;
not marry me; an~ J believe you to&#xD;
be too honorable to seel my love for&#xD;
baser ends."&#xD;
Bertoldo, however,.treats his religi-&#xD;
ous i~ows very lightly, and thinks a&#xD;
dispensation of them could be easily&#xD;
obtained, which would ~entirely ab-&#xD;
soWe him fr~m them.&#xD;
But Camiola'~ high and proper no-&#xD;
tions of honor are shocked at this.-&#xD;
"Oh, take heed, sir," she says;&#xD;
"when what is vowed to heaven is&#xD;
dispensed with to serve our ends on&#xD;
earth, a curse must follow an#d not a&#xD;
blessing."&#xD;
&#xD;
Bertolde, on hearing this, exclaims&#xD;
Is there no hope left me I"&#xD;
And Camiola sorrowfully respond;&#xD;
N~,r to myself; true love should&#xD;
walk upon equal feet: with usit does&#xD;
not. In all things, excepting this,&#xD;
rest' assured I shall be devoted to&#xD;
your service,"&#xD;
And this being her determinate&#xD;
sentence, and riot to be revoked, Ber-&#xD;
toldo takes leave of-the "fairest cruel,"&#xD;
resolved that all thoughts of' women&#xD;
shall perish in hum That as love*&#xD;
only lends him light to see his folly,&#xD;
the blaze of war shall extinguish that&#xD;
dim tape; and glory be his only mis-&#xD;
tress. ,. And Carojola feels that, after&#xD;
the fierce contest she has endured,&#xD;
where love was battling with her&#xD;
sense of honor, though honor had&#xD;
gained the victory, yet now that he&#xD;
was gone, her sun had set never to&#xD;
rise again.&#xD;
Bertoldo and his followers having&#xD;
embarked without taking leave of the&#xD;
king, who is thereby angered; Ful-&#xD;
gentie, the king's favorite, takes the&#xD;
opportunity further to incense the&#xD;
king against his brother, by making&#xD;
it appear not only that this was a&#xD;
gross neglect, but that Bertoldo, and~&#xD;
those who accompanied him, had&#xD;
thrown off their allegiance to the&#xD;
monarch; that they were disaffected&#xD;
to his person and his government;~ had&#xD;
discarded their loyalty, and were dan-&#xD;
g~rous to the State. This determines&#xD;
the weak king to send messengers to&#xD;
the Duchess of Sienna, excusing him-&#xD;
self from having sent these forces&#xD;
against her, and withdrawing all pro-&#xD;
tection from them as his subjects.&#xD;
Astutio selected for this office, and&#xD;
ordered ~not to spare an oath, if neces-&#xD;
sary, that the ~king had never con-&#xD;
sented to it; being reminded that&#xD;
"swearing for the king, though false,&#xD;
is no perjury." Astutio had scarcely&#xD;
&#xD;
-, I&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
needed this injunction, for he tells us,&#xD;
"they are not fit ~o be state agents&#xD;
whose scruples of conscience will not&#xD;
permit them to be prodigal in such&#xD;
tijiles." Fulg9ntio had a double&#xD;
~object in view in thus increasing the&#xD;
king's anger against his brother. His&#xD;
iiesire was to keep Bertoldo out of&#xD;
the way first, as he might become a&#xD;
dangerous rival in the king's affection;&#xD;
and next, because he knew Bertoldo&#xD;
'was a hindrance to gaining the love&#xD;
of Camiola, to whose fortune he&#xD;
aspired. He reminds the king of his&#xD;
I. -&#xD;
promise to aid him in his project on&#xD;
Camiola, and receives the king's ring&#xD;
as a pledge that the king will make&#xD;
(rood whatsoever Fulgentio shall say&#xD;
entreats or commands. And Ful-&#xD;
gentio prepares to make his attack&#xD;
upon the lady, and command her to&#xD;
receive him as her husbanc~.&#xD;
Cainiola, shut up in retirement, is&#xD;
mourning the absence of Bertoldo.&#xD;
Among the dependents of her house-&#xD;
hold, is a well born gentleman of' the&#xD;
name of Adorni, whO though he does&#xD;
not wear her livery, yet acknowledges&#xD;
a duty to her: him Fulgentio orders&#xD;
on his ai'rival at Camiola's house, to&#xD;
command the lady's presence. Ador-&#xD;
ni, indignant at this haughty tone,&#xD;
refuses, telling him he must wait her&#xD;
leisure. Fulgentio, with his natural&#xD;
ari-ogance, and also presuming on the&#xD;
King's favor, draws his sword upon&#xD;
Adorni to compel his obedience;&#xD;
Adorni resists him, and the noise&#xD;
mtde in the scuffle calls Camiola&#xD;
from her retirement. She orders&#xD;
them to refrain, and tells Fulgentio&#xD;
that, although his glittering outside&#xD;
might lead her to expect a 'gentlenian,&#xD;
the rudeness of his carriage a'id&#xD;
demeanor speaks him a coarser thing&#xD;
-and she demands -what he would&#xD;
with her. - - -&#xD;
"Proud one," says Fulgentio, in&#xD;

"This~ pretended ignorance," Ful-&#xD;
gentio returns, "is only to give me a&#xD;

"That word, 'honesty,' is seldom&#xD;
heard from a courtier's mouth," says&#xD;
Camiola; "but deal plainly with me,&#xD;

which induce 'you to quit the freedom&#xD;

makes her mutter treason in her&#xD;
heart, and exclaim against those&#xD;
impious times, when not only the&#xD;
subordinates of justice are corrupted,&#xD;
but kings themselves forsake their&#xD;
honor. A world of thoughts press&#xD;
- on her, how, consistently with her&#xD;
honor, she cail redeem Bertoldo from&#xD;
his misery. She seeks for a friend to&#xD;
assist her, and fixes upon Adorni; for&#xD;

her leave' the room, for wise men&#xD;
might think that in a secret of such&#xD;
weight even one woman were too&#xD;
much. And then she proceeds to&#xD;
unfQld her plans to Adorni. She&#xD;
adjures him, by the love he owes her&#xD;
-love born of duty, no farther,-&#xD;
that he will undertake a service for&#xD;
her, in which his faith, his judgment,&#xD;
his discretion, all that is good in him,&#xD;
must be engaged; nor must he study&#xD;
anything in the execution but the&#xD;
ends~ she aims at. And having&#xD;
received his promise, she proceeds&#xD;
with vehemence to explain her will.&#xD;
"You have heard of Bertoldo's&#xD;
captivity, and the king's neglect; the&#xD;
greatness of his ransom-fifty thou-&#xD;
sand crowns-two parts of my estate.&#xD;
Yet I so love him, to you I will con-&#xD;
fess my weakness, that now, when he&#xD;
is forsaken by all others, I purpose to&#xD;
ransom him, and receive him as my&#xD;
husband. You shall go to Sienna, to&#xD;
pay his ranSom to Gonzaga. Let&#xD;
him swear a solemn contract of&#xD;
espousal to me; which you must&#xD;
witness; if he should-but wh~&#xD;
entertain these jealous fears? 0n&#xD;

may require many necessaries,-furn&#xD;
ish him with these according to hii&#xD;
birth. And from Camie a e iver thu&#xD;
&#xD;
kiss, printed on your lips, and sealed&#xD;
on his hand." And Adorni promises&#xD;
faithfully to fulfil her commands,&#xD;
although they destroy all his own&#xD;
return once more to Sienna,&#xD;
where we find the Duchess Aurelia in&#xD;
possession of the town; the' Duke of&#xD;
Urbin a prisoner, and Bertoldo in a&#xD;
dungeon. Adorni having paid the&#xD;
required ransom, seeks Bertoldo in&#xD;
his prison to set him~ free; he finds&#xD;
him ptostr~te on the ground, almost&#xD;
senseless with despair; he causes his&#xD;
irons to be struck off; and watches&#xD;
with anxiety his awakening from his&#xD;
stupor: and when fully rouses, in.~&#xD;
forms him he owes his deliverande to&#xD;
Camiola, TEE MAW or IIo~o~t. Ber-&#xD;
toldo pours out his gratitude to herr&#xD;
anxiou~Iy demanding what service he&#xD;
can render in return. And Adorni,&#xD;
faithful to his trust, informs him all&#xD;
she desires in return for his freedom&#xD;
is, that he binds himself by a solemn&#xD;
compact to marry her. Bertoldo,&#xD;
enraptured, declares this was' the&#xD;
highest object of his ambition, and&#xD;
wishes all were prepared to' join their&#xD;
hands with the same speed 'as his&#xD;
heart leaps to her. When told that&#xD;
he must swear to do this,-&#xD;
"Swear it 1,' he exclaims,-&#xD;
"'Swear it! collect ail oaths an~ imprecations,&#xD;

But Adorni is no churchman, and&#xD;
such a one must make a record of&#xD;
the oath. And the contract is made&#xD;
and sworn to: Bertoldo is once more&#xD;
free, furnished bravely according to&#xD;

"At the palace, with the Duchess of&#xD;

oaths Bertoldo had sworn, the break-&#xD;
ing of those oaths, and his contract&#xD;
with the 1)~ohess of Sienna, which is&#xD;
&#xD;
speedily to be s~uictit1ed with mar-&#xD;

"Didst thou not grieve, Adorni,&#xD;
when you saw this, as I do now to&#xD;
hear it I"&#xD;
But Adorni thought he had little&#xD;
reason to grieve, ' as Bertoldo's fall&#xD;

GambIa rebukes him for this feeling.&#xD;
