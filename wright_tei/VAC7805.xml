George Melville and Thomas F. Griswold determine that "Old Sassy"&#xD;
had better look out.&#xD;
"CoME in !" said George Melville, in reply to'a&#xD;
triple knocking upon his study' room doorV at the&#xD;
same instant rising to'greet his visitor.&#xD;
" Ah, Tam !" continued Melville, "is that really&#xD;
you at last? I had settled it for a finality that you&#xD;
were growing sickly."&#xD;
"I kave grown 8iclo of lying to that impudent&#xD;
candy peddler. He has dunned me three times to&#xD;
day; and you know our necessary expenses do not&#xD;
admit of any liquidation at present. The ball at&#xD;
Bridgewater severely punished an X and V; the two&#xD;
rides to Utica whipped $11 75; the Christy iMinstrels&#xD;
and. two suppers at Baggs's made away.with $10&#xD;
and then the general effort to satisfy the inner  i&#xD;
at Austin's.  However, the score for that is charged.&#xD;
in account. Austin is the only sensible man in this&#xD;
community. There is but one course left.  George,&#xD;
you must help me pay off 'Old Sassy.' The bar&#xD;

GEORGE MELVILLE.    11&#xD;
&#xD;
idea that that candy peddler should have detained me&#xD;
this evening makes my nerves quiver."&#xD;
"Just in time ! Just in time !" said George, seat-&#xD;
ing himself and assuming a very thoughtful expres-&#xD;
sion of countenance,&#xD;
"What's up, George ?" said Tam.&#xD;
"Got a remittance from my governor this A.M.,&#xD;
at ten o'clock and fifteen minutes," replied George.&#xD;
" No ! How was that? I thought .your trials and&#xD;
tribulations with the august Faculty had proved an,&#xD;
effectual wind-up of all further donations," said Tom.&#xD;
Nota bit ! not a bit !  The note about the three&#xD;
warnings, it would appear, did not arrive," gravely&#xD;
answered George.&#xD;
"Ah ! I see ! I perceive! I apprehend !" said&#xD;
Tam; "the letter was stopped in transit 7"&#xD;
"Just so," replied George.&#xD;
"Capital ! capital !" said Tam. "One more tri-&#xD;
unph of mind over matter:  But, I don't fancy let-&#xD;
ting ' Old Sassy' have his w y without instilling into&#xD;
his mind a due sense of  y importance. He sells&#xD;
sarsaparilla candy;. and, for ,that reason, has been&#xD;
duly honored with the proud title of ' Sassy.' Now,&#xD;
in my case, he imagines that sassy in name and sassy&#xD;
in game are to be coexistent facts. Come, George,&#xD;
ever since I left the active scenes of old Gotham for&#xD;
this collegiate habitation, you have been my only&#xD;
solace in affliction. What do you propose ?"&#xD;
"Can't propose! can't propose! -There are four&#xD;
points in the case which require profound reflection,"&#xD;
replied George, assuming a solemnly benevolent, pa-&#xD;
tronizing air.&#xD;
"Of;course ! Of course !" said Tam. You mean,&#xD;
flrt, the proprieties ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes," said George.&#xD;
"Second, the necessities ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said George.&#xD;
" Third, the difficulties ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said George, without changing the expres-&#xD;
sion of his countenance.&#xD;
"Fourth, and lastly, the prudential calculations ?"&#xD;
To this George answered by a profound inclination-&#xD;
of the head and shoulders.&#xD;
"Very well, George !" continued Tam; "I'm dry as&#xD;
an Arab on the great Sahara. Let us hunt up an&#xD;
oasis where they sell snifters."&#xD;
"All right !" replied George. So, putting on a&#xD;
thick overcoat, for the air was chilling, the two&#xD;
'friends started for Clinton Village.&#xD;
Clinton Village, in the county of Oneida; and&#xD;
State of New York, is classic ground. The states-&#xD;
man, lawyer, physician, divine, author, mechanic,&#xD;
agriculturist, each and all, look back to her with&#xD;
pride and affection. That time will never come&#xD;
when the attachments of youth for person and&#xD;
place fail to become the pride of manhood. When&#xD;
nature has almost exhausted her skill in modelling&#xD;
and framing the scene ; and, when man has used his&#xD;
best endeavor to improve upon nature, the reasons&#xD;
are clearly apparent why Clinton and its surroundin&#xD;
scenery is truly beautiful. Is it very wonderful,&#xD;
that, to the student, so much beauty of nature an&#xD;
art should become classic ground?&#xD;
*      *       * .,          *&#xD;
"Yes, Tam," said George Melville, as he lightly&#xD;
tipped his glass to his friend, while seated in a&#xD;
private room .of the Clinton .Hotel, "I've thought&#xD;
of all that."&#xD;

&#xD;
"The prudential calculations "-interrupted Tam.&#xD;
"Come out exactly right-every figure is correct,"&#xD;
said George.&#xD;
"How with the 'proprieties,' George ?"&#xD;
"Sublime ! In the first place, 'Old Sassy' will&#xD;
have duty to perform," answered George.&#xD;
"That will be proper," gravely remarked Tam.&#xD;
"This duty will be accompanied with considerable&#xD;
labor," continued George.-&#xD;
"Proper again !" echoed Tam.    "Good for his&#xD;
physical health."&#xD;
"He will have excitement," continued George.&#xD;
"Necessary !  absolutely  necessary !  It  will&#xD;
straighten up his stooping frame. Excitement,&#xD;
Mr. Melville, I consider to be eminently proper-&#xD;
eminently! Landlord, replenish the glasses. Less&#xD;
lemon this time. Only a small bit of the peel, if you&#xD;
please."&#xD;
I imagine Mr. Sassy will be obliged to think&#xD;
somewhat," resumed George.&#xD;
"Of course, proper. Habits of fixed attention in&#xD;
business matters are highly important," said Tam.&#xD;
".He will talk," said George.&#xD;
"Proper !" echoed Tam.&#xD;
"Possibly, as Mr. Slick, of Weathersfield, would&#xD;
express it, he may 'holler' considerably," continued&#xD;
George.&#xD;
"Proper, again !" echoed Tam. "Cultivates his&#xD;
voice free gratis. My Governor pays a couple of&#xD;
hundred yearly to cultivate sister Molly's. Mr. Mel-&#xD;
ville, the 'propriaties' are evidently based in wis-&#xD;
dom."&#xD;
"But the necessities, Tam, must rule. 'Old Sassy'&#xD;
has proved that he can be unusually, unnecessarily,&#xD;
&#xD;

unmercifully, intentionally, and most inconsistently&#xD;
sassy.  He had no business to dun you; therefore,&#xD;
as necessity knows no law, he must take his lesson,"&#xD;
said George, finishing his glass.&#xD;
"The 'd/flculties' I believe, are all that nod&#xD;
remain to consider," said Tam.&#xD;
"Difficulties ! Ah, my dear friend, Tam, what&#xD;
would mankind become by eschewing labor? 'Labor&#xD;
conquers all things,' is a grand principle which&#xD;
neither you nor I, in this crisis, dare disregard. Time&#xD;
was when I, even I, would have paused before these&#xD;
difficulties ; but now, with the noble Catiline, I ex-&#xD;
claim:&#xD;
'My sword's my own! Smile on, my lords,&#xD;
I scorn to.count what feelings, withered hopes,&#xD;
Bitter, burning wrongs, I have within my&#xD;
Heart's hot cells shut up, to leave you&#xD;
In your lazy dignities.'&#xD;
Good night landlord."&#xD;
With this the friends returned to the college.&#xD;

Horses versus Thorn-Apple Tree Limbs.&#xD;
Tam duties of a college life followed, as usual, after&#xD;
the conversation detailed in the last chapter, until&#xD;
Tuesday morning of the subsequent week. Bell at&#xD;
three, A.M. Studious young gentlemen at that hour&#xD;
arose. Here and there, from the windows of the va-&#xD;
rious colleges, might be seen faint lights glimmering&#xD;
through the unwashed windows. College students are&#xD;
not all over sensitive about dirt. Especially the real&#xD;
students. It would have been, however, almost a di-&#xD;
rect violatioi of natural law, or, as the idea would be&#xD;
scripturally and concisely expressed, almost "a mira-&#xD;
cle," to discover a morning light in the room of Mr.&#xD;
George Melville, or that of his boon companion and&#xD;
chosen friend, Tam.&#xD;
It is time for the reader to know more of Tam. Mr.&#xD;
James H. Griswold was a retired merchant, residing&#xD;
in the city of New York. His only son, Thomas F.&#xD;
Griswold, had received the advantages of a three&#xD;
years' preparatory course in that old and time-hon-&#xD;
ored "Boarding School for Boys," which for many&#xD;
years was known in New York City as "Tm Wxsu-&#xD;
GToN IsTITUTE." At this institution, the highest&#xD;
grades of scientific, intellectual, and scholastic train-&#xD;
ing could be attained. It combined the advantages&#xD;
&#xD;
of a first class boarding school with the healthy re-&#xD;
straints which are so difficult of application in a col-&#xD;
lege government. In a word, it was a model school&#xD;
of the kind. Mr. Griswold had used every means&#xD;
which lay in his power to give to his son Thomas, the&#xD;
highest benefits of this institution. The teachers had&#xD;
been diligent and faithful in the performance of their&#xD;
duties, and his fond parent looked forward with an&#xD;
earnest and trustful hope tliat his boy would be the&#xD;
joy of his declining years ; that he would fill with&#xD;
competence and intelligence some of the high offices&#xD;
of trust and.power usually consequent upon a profes-&#xD;
sional career.&#xD;
Thomas, as the reader has already learned, was&#xD;
now pursuing his collegiate course. George Melville&#xD;
has found in him a congenial spirit. The characters&#xD;
of the two, formed by the-early home and school asso-&#xD;
ciation and employment ; or rather, want of employ-&#xD;
ment; want of active labor; want of that hard work;&#xD;
want of that knowledge of obedience and just appreci-&#xD;
ation of cause and effect which labor, under a healthy&#xD;
and proper control, seldom or never fails to bestow-&#xD;
thus their thoughts, feelings, impulses, and general&#xD;
characters had been moulded, in some respects, alike.&#xD;
On the Tuesday morning referred to, the two&#xD;
friends were quietly seated upon the front steps of&#xD;
the "South College." Hamilton College is built&#xD;
upon a very high hill, about three-quarters of a mile&#xD;
from Clinton Village.. The distance up the hill, from&#xD;
the valley below, to the College grounds, is about the&#xD;
same. The College precincts inclose nearly twenty&#xD;
acres of land. Three four-story stone buildings, each&#xD;
containing two separate halls, and thirtyitwo suites&#xD;
of rooms, form the College proper. Besides this a&#xD;

fine stone church edifice, used as' a chapel, labora-&#xD;
tory, etc. The buildings stand in a row, from south&#xD;
to north, in the following order : South College, Cha-&#xD;
pel, Middle College, North College. Since the time&#xD;
of this history, a convenient Observatory has been&#xD;
erected. One of the most powerful telescopes in the&#xD;
United States is to be placed in it. This description,&#xD;
the reader will please bear closely in mind, as it will&#xD;
be necessary to a full understanding of some inci-&#xD;
dents which occupied the attention of Mr. George&#xD;
Melville and his friend Thomas F. Griswold.&#xD;
"Well, Tam, my cigar is about finished. Old&#xD;
Sassy is decidedly behind time; it is now five minutes&#xD;
to eight by my watch. There goes the bell for morn-&#xD;
ing prayers, by Jove !"&#xD;
"Yes, George; and, hurrah ! there comes" Sassy,'&#xD;
as sure as sprinkles before a thunderstorm."&#xD;
True-sighted this time, Tam, and no discount,, as&#xD;
you say your governor expresses himself when !he&#xD;
means to be distinctly intelligible. The thunderstorm&#xD;
will come, but we must be sure and set the sprinkles&#xD;
dropping, that the lightning may have a fair chance&#xD;
to play. Wait a moment, until 'Sassy' makes for&#xD;
the South College: He is now, I perceive, hitching&#xD;
up his quadrupedem, like a faithful and. careful&#xD;
jehu. Time will soon work changes with that ani-&#xD;
mal."&#xD;
"1We must not be seen here, George."&#xD;
"Faithful monitor ! Thou art right. In the house&#xD;
there is safety."&#xD;
Quickly the two friends ran into the South Hall of&#xD;
the South College. The candy peddler entered the&#xD;
college yard and came trudging;up the avenue to the&#xD;
South College, bearing two large tin cans hanging&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.               1 I7&#xD;
from a neck-yoke, in the true style of a yankee-notion&#xD;
foot peddler.&#xD;
"Ah! Sassy," said Melville, stepping from his hid-&#xD;
ing-place, "just arrived ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Will you have some candy to-day, Mr.&#xD;
Melville?  Got some very nice. The old woman&#xD;
beat herself this time."&#xD;
"Well; give us half-a-dozen sticks. By the way,&#xD;
what's the trouble between you and Mr. Griswold?&#xD;
He says you have treated him very ungentle-&#xD;
manly."&#xD;
"Mr. Melville, all I did was to ask him for -ten&#xD;
dollars and twenty-two cents, which he owes me for&#xD;
candy."&#xD;
"Why do you not wait for your money until the&#xD;
usual time ?"&#xD;
"The reason is, they say Griswold is getting to be&#xD;
wild, and that he don't pay. I used to think he was&#xD;
a smart fellow, but sence I axed him for the bill I've&#xD;
changed 'pinion."&#xD;
" Well, Sassy, you must look out for him ; per-&#xD;
haps he may play some of his smartness on&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Let him try it once. I'm enoughh for him."&#xD;
" Well, Sassy, keep an eye on him."&#xD;
With this, the peddler entered the North fall of&#xD;
the South College, and commenced'his usual round&#xD;
of visits to the rooms. Finding, however, that all&#xD;
were empty, he took. a seat in room number three;&#xD;
and waited quietly for the release of "his customers."&#xD;
"His customers " is an appellation quite appropriate,&#xD;
for he had sold candy to the fathers 'of some of the&#xD;
students then in the college.&#xD;
" Come forth, Old Tam!    Sassy has departed.&#xD;

Thine hour of vengeance draweth nigh. Seest thou&#xD;
yonder quadyupedern? Let us try his speed.&#xD;
Mayhap his legs may show some wit,&#xD;
Of flesh, 'tis clear, they've not a bit."&#xD;
To gain the road consumed only a moment. Look-&#xD;
ing carefully to see that they were unobserved, the&#xD;
horse was quickly untied and headed for the South.&#xD;
Applying the whip, Melville found he was an active&#xD;
animal, although evidently half starved. He drove&#xD;
the horse behind the rear of the Middle. College,&#xD;
where they unhitched and unharnessed him. Tying&#xD;
him carefully in a corner of a large wood-shed, our&#xD;
two friends proceeded very quietly to place the buggy&#xD;
in the same condition it enjoyed before it was origi-&#xD;
nally put together.&#xD;
"Tam, you've got the wrench, I hope. By Jove!&#xD;
I've got iny hand all tar. Here, give us a lift-on this&#xD;
nut. It starts hard. Won't it try the old sinner's&#xD;
mechanical talents somewhat to put this go-cart&#xD;
together again. Tam, this is my first lesson in real&#xD;
labor. Don't the sweat pour, though!F There! now&#xD;
for the rope. Two wheels at. a time. Tie it on tight.&#xD;
Now, go up on the chapel roof, and let down the&#xD;
string."-&#xD;
Griswold did as requested. in a few moments&#xD;
he appeared on the top of the building, and lowered&#xD;
a light but strong cord. This, Melville tied to the&#xD;
rope, by means of which, the whole buggy was drawn&#xD;
p on to the chapel roof, and safely deposited in&#xD;
the belfry.&#xD;
"Ten minutes to nine, hey! Time enough left.&#xD;
There go the juniors, though. Keep shady, Tam."&#xD;
After waiting the ten minutes, all the classes had&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
been dismissed, and most of the students had entered&#xD;
their rooms for study.&#xD;
"Now's our time, Tam. Here is the thorn-apple tree&#xD;
limb, and a beauty it is./ Every point on it is sharper&#xD;
than a needle-! What a splendid tail, though. Give&#xD;
us the cord, Tam. There! I rather guess that horse's&#xD;
tail, and that thorn-apple tree limb are united nolens&#xD;
volens. Now give him his head, Tam."&#xD;
"Hold ! George, let me take an observation, and&#xD;
see if the coast is clear: George, Old Prex is coming&#xD;
over to his room."&#xD;
"Good, Tam! Let us see how much practical&#xD;
piety he will exhibit towards a poor dumb beast."&#xD;
Wjth the word, the horse was allowed his free-&#xD;
dom. Our readers must imagine the effect of a&#xD;
thorn-apple tree limb tied to the tail of a wide-awake&#xD;
horse. At every jump he made, his tail whipped&#xD;
the sharp thorns into his flesh, breaking many of them&#xD;
off, and giving the poor animal terrible torment.&#xD;
He was soon flying within precincts forbidden to all&#xD;
of his kind, at the top of his speed. The students of&#xD;
ancient lore, realized, if they never did until then,&#xD;
the beauty of that celebrated line which occurs in&#xD;
one of the books of the .nead, descriptive of the&#xD;
galloping of horses over the plain:&#xD;
Quadrupe |Idante pu J trem-soni I tu quatit ungula 1 campum." *&#xD;
A hundred and fifty wild young men were soon&#xD;
eagerly chasing after the maddened horse. The old&#xD;
college walls echoed to such shouts of laughter as&#xD;
had not been heard since th'eir"corner-stone was&#xD;
laid.&#xD;
"Run, Jim! run!"-c''Walker, head hitn! ha! ha!&#xD;

&#xD;
wasn't that a jump !"-"By Jove! he'll certainly&#xD;
break his neck !"-" Get out of the way, Melville I"-&#xD;
"President N       take care ! he must be wild !"-&#xD;
"What a bound that was !"&#xD;
Such were the shouts which were heard from, a&#xD;
hundred voices, until the two friends spied Old Sassy&#xD;
with his cans, quietly looking on, shouting, laughing;&#xD;
and encouraging the wild students in their exciting&#xD;
chase.&#xD;
"KHa! ha !" said Old Sassy, "don't he jump!&#xD;
Don't he go it strong !  hat's that on his tail?&#xD;
Whose horse is he ?"&#xD;
"Sassy, you appear to enjoy the tormenting of&#xD;
that poor dumb beast amazingly," said Melville.&#xD;
"I should laugh out of the other side of my cheek,&#xD;
if I were in your situation."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Melville? ha! ha ! See him shake&#xD;
his head. How he froths at the ziouth! Why so,&#xD;
Mr. Melville ?"&#xD;
"Simply, Sassy, because in my opinion that horse&#xD;
belongs to you."&#xD;
"No! does it ?" said he, looking very intensely at&#xD;
the infuriated animal, and turning pale. "Yes! it&#xD;
is my jack! Whoa! whoa! Catch him! catch him!"&#xD;
he now shouted  ih9top of his voice. "Catch my&#xD;
jackt"&#xD;
Then dropping both of the candy cans, yoke and&#xD;
a~Iupon the groutid, he was soon the most eager&#xD;
engaged in the chase.&#xD;
vik quiet picked up the cans; and, every-&#xD;
body bengso'imnsely occupied with the horse,&#xD;
he succeeded in conveyig them into the South Hall&#xD;
ofothe Middle College, when  the fourth story, his&#xD;
;room was situated. He then'went down among the&#xD;
&#xD;
.students, and picking out about 'twenty of ,his par-&#xD;
ticular friends, sent them one by one to his cham-&#xD;
bers. In ten minutes the cans were emptied of their&#xD;
luscious contents, and the facts about the horse were&#xD;
duly promulgated. Melville's friends immediately&#xD;
voted the whole affair to be a consistent and emi-&#xD;
nently proper; judgment upon the audacious Sassy.&#xD;
(Not one among them, by the way, who did not fear&#xD;
the presentation of an act daily.) In the meantime,&#xD;
the candy peddler had caught his horse, and brought&#xD;
him exactly beneath Melville's window, where he&#xD;
commenced shaking his fist at, the whole body of&#xD;
students, and vociferating terrible vengeance upon&#xD;
the perpetrators of the dastardly act.&#xD;
" Griswold," said Melville,  I am astonished to&#xD;
hear such foul language uttered right in the pre-&#xD;
sence of our well-beloved, the faithful President of&#xD;
this time-honored institution of learning. Desend,&#xD;
most worthy friend, and clear the stone steps below my&#xD;
hall window of all that wear the shape of manhood!"&#xD;
Griswold, comprehending Melville's object, ran&#xD;
down stairs, and soon had the steps clear. One of&#xD;
the stIdents, at Melville's request, then dropped the&#xD;
cans from the window on to the steps. Such a pro-&#xD;
cecure would frighten a sane horse.   It is not&#xD;
strange, considering the wild condition which Sassy's&#xD;
animal ad involuntarily assumed, that he imme-&#xD;
diately concluded the noise was a signal for him to&#xD;
run again. Such, indeed, I am sorry the reader must&#xD;
learn, was the result ; and, it was are than an hour&#xD;
before he could again be secured. But the poor&#xD;
peddler had not learned the half of his woes. His&#xD;
wagon-but we must commence a new chapter for&#xD;
the wagon.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Wait for the wagon."&#xD;
WHERE'S my' wagon? Has any one seen my har-&#xD;
ness?" What have they done with the buggy ?"&#xD;
"Come, Tam, I perceive the quadrupedem is pro-&#xD;
perly subdied. It is time for the second step in our&#xD;
arduous undertaking."&#xD;
It was now nearly twelve o'clock, meridian. The&#xD;
two friends, having carefully examined the course&#xD;
and finding everything clear, went to the Chapel.&#xD;
In a few minutes the bell-ringer sounded the bell, an-&#xD;
nouncing to the hungry students that the sun had&#xD;
arrived at the zenith. As soon as this duty was per-&#xD;
formed, the faithful monitor of the hour started to&#xD;
appease his hunger.&#xD;
"Well, George, F-x has locked his door what&#xD;
shall be done now?"&#xD;
"F -x has dared to mar our plan, and so we, of&#xD;
necessity, must mar his door. This is the only ac-&#xD;
cess to our wagon."&#xD;
In a few moments the door was broken in. The&#xD;
two went up to the belfry, and with a rope fastened&#xD;
the bell-clapper~o a part of the wagon. Of course,&#xD;
when the bell-ringer should strike the hour for the&#xD;
afternoon recitation, which was four o'clock, the bell&#xD;
would not sound, and the wagon would be disco-&#xD;
vered. .But long ere that, Melville well knew, the&#xD;
&#xD;
whole energies of the College Faculty would be&#xD;
aroused in search after the wagon; for, at least, they&#xD;
would fear they might become liable for its loss. The&#xD;
announcement, therefore, of its discovery would bring&#xD;
all who were engaged in the search to the Chapel.&#xD;
This would be likely to 'get up considerable excite-&#xD;
ment. There would occur, necessarily, some delay in&#xD;
ringing the bell; all of which led the two friends to&#xD;
the conclusion that perhaps the students, with a very&#xD;
little help from them, might be collected in front of&#xD;
the chapel; in which case, the whole would result in&#xD;
the different professors dismissing their classes for the&#xD;
day.&#xD;
Such a consummation would make the whole affair&#xD;
popular, even with the more sober-minded students,&#xD;
and tend to allay any serious consequences to them-&#xD;
selves in case of exposure. The finale was even bet-&#xD;
ter than they had planned. The peddler cried so&#xD;
piteously about the loss of his wagon, harness, and&#xD;
candy ; the bruising of his cans and injury to his&#xD;
horse, that the Faculty held a special meeting, and&#xD;
sent a committee to have the students requested to&#xD;
find the wagon. Of course, Griswold and Melville&#xD;
were very ardent in their efforts to discover it.&#xD;
When the hour of four arrived, no one thought -of&#xD;
recitation. The wagon was yet undiscovered. A few&#xD;
minutes after the hour for recitation had passed, Mel-&#xD;
ille, now all heated with his earnest endeavors, to&#xD;
discover the hidden property, suggested to the Presi-&#xD;
dent that every nook and corner of the- college had&#xD;
been visited by him except the belfry; atthe same.&#xD;
time handing him a small piece of.the harness, which&#xD;
he discovered had been dropped by himself when the&#xD;
wagon was pulled up upon the roof.&#xD;

And sure enough, Mr. F-x now appeared upon&#xD;
the scene.ie couldgive no explanation about the&#xD;
door or the wagon    To exonerate himself from&#xD;
bameYor his absence, he produced the following&#xD;

The President read the note, and immediately said&#xD;
to Mr. F-x:&#xD;
" It is all satisfactorily explained; but you should&#xD;
have made more haste."&#xD;
"I found Mr. S     r without the papers, and at&#xD;

them," said Mr. F-x.&#xD;
"Me !" said the professor in question. "Papers!&#xD;
I anxious ! What do you mean, Mr. F-x ?"&#xD;
The stare which the learned professor gave on&#xD;
reading the note, was.worth an evening at Burton's&#xD;
to have witnessed.&#xD;
"That note, Mr. F-x, is a forgery ! a forgery!&#xD;
Have you-no, I cannot believe you have been&#xD;
guilty of such subterfuge. It is evidently a part of&#xD;
this day's extraordinary proceedings."&#xD;
We may as well -here give the explanation of the&#xD;
note.&#xD;
Melville had foreseen the necessity of sending&#xD;
Mr. F-x away for the afternoon, as the broken&#xD;
door would be liable to bring on the finale too soon.&#xD;
He had, therefore, forged the'note in the handwriting&#xD;
of the professor, inclosing therein the three dollars.&#xD;
Of course Mr. F-x, who was half a mile from,&#xD;
college at the time he received the note, did not&#xD;
return to his room, and the fact that the note con-&#xD;
tained a three dollar bill, satisfied him the request&#xD;
was bonaftde.&#xD;
About a week after the occurrence, Melville got&#xD;
the candy peddler into his room, and having nego-&#xD;
tiated for his silence, paid him his full bill for dam-&#xD;
ages, also informing him that the next time he&#xD;
cautioned him to beware of Mr. Griswold's smartness,&#xD;

better to heed his advice; The result of the whole&#xD;
was, that Griswold and Sassy became excellent&#xD;
friends--at least Sassy never asked Griswold for&#xD;
another bill.&#xD;
This is but a sample of the occupation in which&#xD;
te two friends were continually employed. During&#xD;
e first few terms of their collegiate course, their&#xD;
boarding-school fitting enabled them to keep up a&#xD;
fair character as students; but, with the second year,&#xD;
their standing gradugllflowered. As juniors, they&#xD;
were hardly able to maintain a position in their class.&#xD;
They were simply tolerated for their money.&#xD;

TVb&#xD;
The Boyhood  Days of George Melville.&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE, in the fall of 18--., commenced&#xD;
his undergraduate course at Hamilton College. He&#xD;
was received by the Board of Examiners with a&#xD;
well disguised pride. They confidently predicted for&#xD;
the young student a successful career, which would&#xD;
do honor, to themselves, their institution of lear ing,&#xD;
as well to his parents an4 large circle of friends.&#xD;
Master George, as the schoolboy, was about equal&#xD;
to boys in general. He seemed to love his books;&#xD;
so his instructors, during his preparatory course, had&#xD;
confidently insisted. His share of the "rewards of&#xD;
merit," certificates of "good behavior " and sundry&#xD;
little bound volumes, with "Presented to George&#xD;
Melville, as a ,reward of industry," written on the fly.&#xD;
leaf in a most careful and scholastically precise chi-&#xD;
rography, had been quite extensive.&#xD;
George must not go at a discount, if, at this period&#xD;
of his life, he imagined himself to be indoctrinated&#xD;
with the love of books and a high sense of his own&#xD;
importance. The praises of unwise teachers had&#xD;
been so freely lavished, that hyper-self-confidence&#xD;
had come to him legitimately, ,being the result of&#xD;
folly's culture, not a natural or indigenous plant.&#xD;
He had become ambitious for praise' and maste d&#xD;

&#xD;
all of his tasks at school for the sake of triumph.&#xD;
The idea of approaching study for the sake of honor-&#xD;
ing the science or art, as a child of science or art,&#xD;
had never been the groundwork upon which the&#xD;
teachers, in his preparatory course, had built his&#xD;
a1,its of thought.&#xD;
If he mastered a page. of the Anabasis, Iliad or&#xD;
Prometheus, of Sallust, Cicero, Livy or Virgil, if he&#xD;
solved a mathematical problem, or toiled over chemi-&#xD;
cal analysis, it was done solely for the purpose of&#xD;
carrying away the prizes from his schoolmates.&#xD;
Parents'teachers and friends had alike mistaken the&#xD;
natural desires of his mind. He was a practical boy.&#xD;
Labor-hard work in some of the honorable trades,&#xD;
was the ship which would have borne him'safely and&#xD;
proudly over the sea of life; but he was not to be&#xD;
allowed to tread her deck'&#xD;
"Oh ! indeed no ! my boy," said his fond mother,&#xD;
"must never' soil his hands with menial employment,&#xD;
or associate with the vulgar, toil-worn mechanic."&#xD;
And the kind, but mistaken woman wiped h~r deli-&#xD;
cate forehead with a finely-wrought cambric hand-&#xD;
kerchief.&#xD;
"Not he 1" echoed the wealthy father. "He shall&#xD;
write his name a statesman. No pent-up workshop,&#xD;
with its hours of sweat-producing toil, shall become&#xD;
to him a care ; no grim-visaged, hard-fisted, work-&#xD;
soiled artisan shall ever claim  my George as a&#xD;
fellow-craftsman. My boy a mechanic ! the boy&#xD;
who has carried off all the prizes at every school&#xD;
he has attended from infancy ! And now a matricu-&#xD;
latgd student in one of the highest institutions of&#xD;
learning in the land."&#xD;
The excited old gentleman had no idea how often&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE..&#xD;
these prizes had been skillfully-prepared instruments&#xD;
of flattery gotten up by wide-awake (we should say&#xD;
depraved) teachers, to whom his name,;influence,&#xD;
patronage and good will were vital.&#xD;
"Please. the child for ' the parent's. friendship."&#xD;
Such is the motto which underlies the success of&#xD;
thousands who become teachers of youth under&#xD;
American institutions.&#xD;
Show- the pupil the importance and value of the&#xD;
knowledge to be taught, and then please him by the&#xD;
reward of conscious success.&#xD;
Such is the motto we present as an amendment.&#xD;
The teacher who succeeds in gaining the friendship&#xD;
of a pupil under it, will find he possesses a friend for&#xD;
life.&#xD;
May the time come when, at least in our public&#xD;
schools, teachers can hold the tenure of their salaries&#xD;
subject to anything, any power and anybody but-the&#xD;
wealthy nabob of the ward, village, precinct, town or&#xD;
other school district!&#xD;

The Excursion Party for Niagara-Aster House-James Mordaunt-&#xD;
The Plot:&#xD;
OrE year, subsequent to the events already- de-&#xD;
tailed, passed rapidly away. George Melville, who&#xD;
was now approaching the close of his junior colle-&#xD;
giate yearfound that health began to give way&#xD;
before the serious attacks of dissipation. He had&#xD;
gradually yielded to the luring pleasures which are&#xD;
freely spread before young men of his class, until&#xD;
the naturally strong constitution, with which he had&#xD;
been blessed, 'was broken. His parents attributed&#xD;
his pale countenance and lifeless eye to a severe&#xD;
application to study. As vacation was near at hand,&#xD;
Mr   elville counselled a long journey, by easy dis-&#xD;
tances, on horseback. To this end, he purchased for&#xD;
his son a fine saddle horse, and sent it to Clinton.&#xD;
George, however, could not think of the proposal&#xD;
unless his boon companion and friend, Thomas Gras-&#xD;
woW, accompanied him. This difficulty was finally&#xD;
overcome, and the two friends, on the 29th of July,&#xD;
left Clinton, most splendidly mounted, determined to&#xD;
see as much of the great State of New York as could&#xD;
be travelled over, in this knight-errant style,'during a&#xD;
three months' vacation. Their route nearly enclosed&#xD;
the western part of the Empire State. We will leave&#xD;
&#xD;
the two friends to pursue their way in search of stir-&#xD;
ring events and the bloom of health to introduce the&#xD;
reader to other scenes.&#xD;

"Ring the bell, Clara! I shall never succeed in&#xD;
getting Carlo to obey orders. Carlo, lie down! lie&#xD;
down ! down, Carlo! that's a good fellow !"&#xD;
It was of no avail. Carlo insisted upon having his&#xD;
curiosity gratified in the examination of several new&#xD;
dresses which had just been sent from Stewart's.&#xD;
He already had torn a piece out of one, and just as&#xD;
he caught a second in his teeth, Bell Mortimer&#xD;
requested her cousin Clara Edgemonte to ring for the&#xD;
servant.&#xD;
Carlo seemed to understand the meaning of the&#xD;
bell-ringing, for he immediately desisted, and very&#xD;
respectfully approached his beautiful mistress, from&#xD;
whose face all frowns on account of her pet Carlo&#xD;
immediately disappeared.; and, while she kindly&#xD;
turned to acknowledge the instinctive contrition of&#xD;
Carlo, gracefully reaching forward her ha  aress&#xD;
him, and casting her eyes                    c-&#xD;

lavished rich endowments upon her person. Her form&#xD;
was the perfection of womanly grace and elegance.&#xD;
The snowy garniture of her arm, tinctured here and&#xD;
there with the rosy blushes of youth and health, was,&#xD;
if we may be allowed the appellation, "eerless. Her&#xD;
dark, full eye, crested with exquisitely delicate brows,&#xD;
fell upon the beholder instantly to stir the soul and&#xD;
awaken thoughts of that wisdom which had deigned&#xD;
to create for this earth so much loveliness. Bell Mor-&#xD;

not one who could stem the torrents of  trial and&#xD;
affliction; who. could proudly rise superior to taunt&#xD;
and bitter woe, and illustrate the undying, unyield-&#xD;
ing, persevering courage of a true woman. She&#xD;
seemed rather made for Heaven, to add a joy among&#xD;
the angels. Oh! well for Bell Mortimer was it, that&#xD;
Heaven has enclosed the future within an impenetra-&#xD;
ble tomb-has placed before its entrance a veil&#xD;
which no mortal may remove, which time only is&#xD;
permitted to lift. But we must not anticipate.&#xD;
The dresses were duly examined; the pros and&#xD;
cons duly weighed; the necessities for their advan-&#xD;
tageous application duly illustrated.&#xD;
" I must say, Clara, that ' tissue' is perfectly&#xD;
lovely. It will become. you even better than the&#xD;
India silk' you wore at Mrs. Glover's. What do&#xD;
you think of this 'peach-blossom silk' for me ?"&#xD;
Let me examine it. 'Hold it up more to the&#xD;
light. There-so ! It is really just the thing for&#xD;
your complexion, Bell. Dark hair and dark eyes,&#xD;
.:e, will grow irresistible under the influ-&#xD;

in his mind when he&#xD;

"Well, Clara, if  u ik so, I vote at once in&#xD;
favor of adding it to my wardrobe. But I have got&#xD;
two dressesthe start of you'on the catalogue. I am&#xD;
determined one of those ',organdies' shall become&#xD;
your 'personal property,' as that young sprig of the&#xD;
bar expressed it last night.".&#xD;
y the way, Bell, now that you have referred to&#xD;
James Mordaunt, did you notice how skillfully he&#xD;
wins one over t] his way of thinking, how  ready&#xD;
he is.with hisflftery, and how easily he assumes&#xD;
&#xD;
phases of character. I prophesy he will become&#xD;
either a great man or a great rogue. I don't like his&#xD;
eye ; but suppose I am doing violence to your feel-&#xD;
ings, .as your father has introduced him into our&#xD;
circle, and regards him, evidently, with great friend-&#xD;
ship and esteem."&#xD;
" Oh, Clara, do not mind Mr. Mordaunt; -'he will&#xD;
never be anything to me, so please, ma chiere amie,&#xD;
attend to this important business. You know we&#xD;
start for Niagara next week, and all these dresses&#xD;
must be fitted and finished."&#xD;
Thus the young ladies ran on until the loud-peal-&#xD;
ing gong of that time-honored hotel, the Astor, an-&#xD;
nounced their dining hour.&#xD;
One week from that day a party of eight ladies&#xD;
and gentlemen occupied four seats in the Hudson&#xD;
River morning train for Albany. It consisted of&#xD;
Hon. 13. F. Mortimer, Mr. H. B. Edgemonte, Madams&#xD;
Mortimer and Edgemonte, Bell 'Mortimer Clara&#xD;
Edgemonte, James Mordaunt, Esq,. and Frederiek&#xD;
Mortimer, Bell's brother.&#xD;
"Bell," said Mr. Edgemonte, "this early rising&#xD;
seems to paint your face upbly"&#xD;
" Thank you, Uncle Harwfor the compliment ;&#xD;
but I know very well allab o titthe partiality 'of your&#xD;
eyesight. I am disposed to credit you for sincerity,&#xD;
but if nothing else betrayed my ever kind uncle's&#xD;

There is generally but little pleasure to be derived&#xD;
from a ride in the swift-winged steam car. Modes&#xD;
of travelling, so far as viewing scenery is in question,&#xD;
obey that general law of mechanics, "what is gained&#xD;
in speed is lost in power," and vice versa.   There is&#xD;
nothing which will take the place of a private car-&#xD;
riage, if the traveller desires to look upon the face&#xD;
of the .country. But the expansion of empire has&#xD;
brought into active usefulness so many new princi-&#xD;
ples, the genius of man has laid open so many hidden&#xD;
paths of invention and discovery, that beauties of&#xD;
scenery are now left for the poet, the painter, the&#xD;
scholar, the recluse.  He who would grasp the~ieins&#xD;
of power; who would be great in theforum; who&#xD;
would spread the seas with hir merchant fleet; or,&#xD;
who would control the little cotrie around him, of&#xD;
iechanical, professional, or mercantile mind ; or of&#xD;
okeor all, must be great in practical wisdom.; ready,&#xD;
with practical illustration.   Like a Napoleon, he&#xD;
must grasp the detail, ever remembering that "drops&#xD;
make an ocean."    This is an age when man&#xD;
" Ina moment speaks to man, though empires intervene,-&#xD;
And makes tie sun portray himself, engraves with morning sheen;&#xD;
Constructs the giant eye, whiph glares on suns before unknown ;&#xD;
The glass which scans the atom systems, living in his own-&#xD;

Through rocks, o'er hills and plains, he goes, upon the car enshrined,&#xD;
Which mocks the fleetness of the deer and leaves the wind be-&#xD;
hind."&#xD;
We shall not attempt to describe the beauties of&#xD;
the lovely Hudson. The little party of friends, for&#xD;
whom we desire to bespeak an interest from our&#xD;
readers, were familiar with all the magnificent views&#xD;
which a day-boat trip from    New York to Albany&#xD;
&#xD;
never fails to present. Our readers will, therefore,&#xD;
please go contrary to the advice contained in Mr.&#xD;
Mordaunt's suggestion, delivered the evening previous&#xD;
at one .of ,the private parlors of the Astor, if they&#xD;
would behold the most lovely river views in the State&#xD;
of New York.&#xD;
"Miss Mortimer," said Mr. Mordaunt, "our party&#xD;
are all well posted in Hudson River scenery; I vote,&#xD;
therefore, for a quick trip and plenty of leisure at the&#xD;
Delevan. Cars for me!&#xD;
" Agreed-! agreed !" said one and all.&#xD;
While the party pursue their journey, will the&#xD;
reader bear with us a moment, as we introduce to his&#xD;
more intimate acquaintance James Mordaunt, Esq.,&#xD;
who, performs a most important part in this&#xD;
history.&#xD;
James Mordaunt was now twenty-five years of age.&#xD;
His parents separated from each other when he swa&#xD;
but an infant. Soon after the separation, causegwny&#xD;
a want of kindness to Mrs. Mordaiint on his fatiers&#xD;
part, James's mother was carried to her grave  She&#xD;
was a woman of the highest culture, the keenest&#xD;
sense of motherly affection, a consistent Christian,&#xD;
and generally,' wise in her plans and judgments.&#xD;
Had she been spared to rear her son under her own&#xD;
light and example, the talents with which nature had&#xD;
most lavishly endowed him, would scarcely have&#xD;
failed to present society with an upright, useful, and&#xD;
safe counsel for the widow and fatherless, .fhe orphan&#xD;
and unfortunate, in the noble profession which now&#xD;
he was destined to dishonor.- His mother's death&#xD;
seemed to be one of those provideuces which lnatt's&#xD;
judgment would have pronounced unnatura and&#xD;
unwise, were it not that the ways ofthat Providence,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7805-00000019"/>&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
though "past finding out," are the direction of inft-&#xD;
nite wisdom.&#xD;
James was reared by an aunt, the wife of his&#xD;
mother's brother. She was a brilliant, energetic,&#xD;
self-denying, ambitious, but unscrupulous woman.&#xD;
Under the semblance of Christian graces and virtues,&#xD;
she possessed some dangerous characteristics of tem-&#xD;
per and \ thought.  "Means to the end, right or&#xD;
wrong !" "Success covers all the sin !" These old&#xD;
sayings express her character better than any. ex-&#xD;
tended description. Added to this, she was quick to&#xD;
perceive, prompt in her plans, and swift to execute.&#xD;
Her nephew learned but too well the lessons which&#xD;
the example of his aunt constantly presented. He&#xD;
learned also to worship her as a being placed far&#xD;
above the ordinary of her race. Her will, to him,&#xD;
was law; the gratification of her slightest wish, his&#xD;
delight.&#xD;
James had received a liberal education. He gra-&#xD;
duated at Columbia College, New York, with the&#xD;
highest honors in the gift of his classmates and&#xD;
instructors.  His legal studies had been .mastered&#xD;
with equal success, and he was now a junior part-&#xD;
ner in one of -the most reliable law-firms in the&#xD;
metropoliA of Amerida. Already his name began to&#xD;
be sounded upon the lips of the great merchants,&#xD;
brokers, ship-masters, and bankers, who rule the&#xD;
winds; and waves of the commerce, progress, and&#xD;
-renown of the American name.&#xD;
Mrs. Tryon, James's aunt and second mother, was&#xD;
awidow. She maintained a princely establishment&#xD;
inFifth Avenue. Her patronage was certain success&#xD;
to any ambitious and fairly skilled youth. She could&#xD;
open the gates to the magic circle, of High Life in&#xD;
&#xD;
New York. "He visits at Mrs. Tryon's," settled the&#xD;
question, "'Shall Mr.  be invited $" in the affirm-&#xD;
ative for many a youthful aspirant after the pleasures&#xD;
and influence of fashionable life. A short conver-&#xD;
sation held between Mrs. Tryon and her nephew will&#xD;
possess the reader of some facts which are necessary&#xD;
links in this story.&#xD;
" James, do you know how Hon. B. F. Mortimer&#xD;
stands in regard to property ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes! His fortune is ample. Our firm hold&#xD;
some of his assets here in New York, as agents,&#xD;
which yield him a clear rental of $5,000 per annum.&#xD;
Besides this, he owns. a country residence on the&#xD;
banks of the Cayuga Lake, in the western part of the&#xD;
State, attached to whih are three hundred acres of&#xD;
splendid farming lands."&#xD;
"Well, do you know, I have found out that he has&#xD;
an only daughter, and but one son. The daughter is&#xD;
eighteen years of age; pretty, dark hair, dark eyes,&#xD;
unexceptionable complexion, form, etc., and withal I&#xD;
am informed she has some knowledge of the world;&#xD;
graceful, easy, witty.., A gentleman friend tells me&#xD;
she is really brilliant. Now, James, I want to see&#xD;
her, and if--well, you know it is about time&#xD;
you began to. think of a wife. I have nearly con-&#xD;
cluded that she will do. But I must see her first."&#xD;
"Then you shall have your wish. The whole fam&#xD;
.ily, I learned from my senior partner yesterday, will&#xD;
be in town next week, en route for Washington. - r.&#xD;
Mortimer is member for his congressional district.&#xD;
An invitation from you through my partner will be&#xD;
just d propose, for Mr. MortiLner must spend a few,&#xD;
days here on business matters. Wait until they are&#xD;
quietly domesticated at the Astor, and with your-head&#xD;

and my hand, .the desired object can be accom-&#xD;

This conversation occurred about six months prior .&#xD;
to the time which saw the party already described as&#xD;
on their way for Niagara. Of course Mrs. Tryon ac-&#xD;
complished her design. Bell Mortimer proved to be&#xD;
even more satisfactory to the ambitious aunt than&#xD;
imagination, upon chance description, had painted.&#xD;
She was perfectly captivated by the gentle girl.&#xD;
*      *      *      *      *      ,&#xD;
" Yes, James," said she to her nephew, " now is&#xD;
your time or never. Go with the party to Niagara.;&#xD;
make a visit at her father's home ; and, before you&#xD;
return, have matters all arranged if possible. With&#xD;
the good will of the father, the love of the mother,&#xD;
and your own talents, of which I must be allowed the&#xD;
expression, I am more than. proud--there, there !&#xD;
don't be frightened ; you have heard nothing but&#xD;
truth : you must be a weak one if you fail with the&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
" True, but I do not love her. She is attractive&#xD;
and "&#xD;
" Pshaw ! My wise sir, marriage is a game-love&#xD;
is but an empty title. I married for place, money,&#xD;
and power. You had better marry for love, and live&#xD;
on it. Don't you think it would be better for us both&#xD;
had I, a little sentimental in my youth, taken up with&#xD;
some poor love of a mania What a nice time it would&#xD;
be were I now living with 'you in a quiet hovel-my&#xD;
poor husband gone-and you teaching, school, and&#xD;
hoarding round, or selling lace, bodkins, hair-pins,&#xD;
and calicoes, or patiently adding mortar and a brick,&#xD;

support your lone aunt. How the neighbors in the&#xD;
parish would laud the dutiful nephew who devoted&#xD;
all his earnings to support his poor, heart-broken&#xD;
widowed mother's sister."&#xD;
The expression of face sand action, gesture, etc.,&#xD;
with which Mrs. Tryon accompanied this argument,&#xD;
caused her nephew to burst into an almost uncontroll-&#xD;
able fit of laughter.&#xD;
"Good, good! What an advocate of woman's&#xD;
rights you would make ! My dearest mother, I am&#xD;

"BAGGAGE for the steamboat, Mr. Mortimer."&#xD;
"Yes,-captain. Mere are my checks. How are&#xD;
they all at Aurora ?"                         -&#xD;
"Well, sir. Your place is looking fmely. Jim-&#xD;
my is a faithful and active hand.  Everything is&#xD;
trim. Won't the people be glad to see you! I did&#xD;
not expect you until next week; but last evening's pa-&#xD;
pers said you were to leave the Astor en route for&#xD;
Niagara, with a large party of friends. I knew you&#xD;
would not pass Aurora. But are. you really going.&#xD;
West "&#xD;
"Yes, captain. Believe the girls have planned a&#xD;
trip to the Falls."&#xD;
The party we left en route up the noble Hudson,&#xD;
were now passengers on board a little steamer which&#xD;
plies on that beautiful inland sheet of water known, in&#xD;
song and descriptive writings of travellers, as Cayuga&#xD;
Lake. Aurora is about twenty miles up the lake,&#xD;
and is justly called the paradise of New York. For&#xD;
beauty of scenery no place in the State, we venture&#xD;
to assert, can surpass it. The residences of the in-&#xD;
habitants are mostly built on a scale of princely mag-&#xD;
nificence, blended with true taste and refinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
A couple of hours afterwards, Mrs. Mortimer was&#xD;
acting the part of hostess to her friends, while her&#xD;
daughter Bell, with the eager longing.. and ardent&#xD;
temperament of a youthful heart, went bounding from&#xD;
room to room, giving vent to the pent'up love for her&#xD;
beautiful home, which had been accumulating during&#xD;
a six months' absence. This was her cousin Clara's&#xD;
first visit to Aurora. Of course there was enough to&#xD;
occupy their attention. With two young gentlemen,&#xD;
one to be introduced to her circle of acquaintances&#xD;
and also one beautiful cousin such as Clara Edge-&#xD;
monte really was, for, though of a different style,&#xD;
Clara's beauty almost rivalled that of her cousin&#xD;
Bell. Bell, however, was not the one to rise upon&#xD;
the misfortunes of others. Jealousy was a stranger&#xD;
to her heart;- consequently, she could and did love her&#xD;
cousin Clara with the true and earnest affection of&#xD;
her nature. But, added to all this, Mr. and Mrs. Edge-&#xD;
- monte were not least thought of in Bell's plans and&#xD;
projects for the week.&#xD;
"To-morrow, at five o'clock precisely, wind and&#xD;
weather permitting, Messrs. Fred. Mortimer and&#xD;
James Mordaunt are politely requested to prepare&#xD;
for a cruise 'on the bosom of the Cayuga," said Bell,&#xD;
-  putting on the look and action of a queen.&#xD;
" We are her majesty's most humble servants," re-&#xD;
sponded Fred. "The winds and waves of old Cayu-&#xD;
ga will indeed be honored by so much loveliness re-&#xD;
clining upon her breast. The hour will be propitious,&#xD;
if the officers and crew of our Fairy Queen's yacht&#xD;
are allowed the privilege of obeying the song in the&#xD;

&#xD;
to that end, Mr. Mordaunt, shall we bid the ladies&#xD;
good night ?"&#xD;
"Not until I have obtained from them," replied&#xD;
Mr. Mordaunt, "that promised duet. I call for the&#xD;
music first."&#xD;
'I suppose it is my duty to set an example of obe-&#xD;
dience if I expect obedience' in return," said Bell.&#xD;
"Come, fair coz--ah ! thank you, Fred--that piano&#xD;
as gracefully-opened. Clara, dear, you must preside&#xD;
at the instrument. We will give you, Mr. Mordaunt,&#xD;
but one piece, and that shall send you to the arms of&#xD;
gentle slumber."&#xD;
The two cousins then sang together that exquisite-&#xD;
ly beautiful duet commencing.--&#xD;
"Gently, gently, sighs the breeze,&#xD;
Like a whisper through the trees--&#xD;
Like a voice of seraph bright,&#xD;
Singing to the world, 'Good night."&#xD;
Bell, having prepared everything for the morning's&#xD;
pleasure, retired to ier room, in company with her-&#xD;
cousin Clara. She was yet entirely unsuspicious of'&#xD;
the sentiments which were moulding the conduct of&#xD;
Mr. Mordaunt. Her thoughts of him and acts for his&#xD;
pleasure.flowed wholly from a desire to please her&#xD;
father'&amp;amp;friend and guest. Clara, however, was not&#xD;
so blinded. She, more alive to the workings of Mor-&#xD;
daunt's countenance, had read his inmost thoughts, and&#xD;
correctly. She was well acquainted with Mrs. Tryon.,&#xD;
S   knew also how devotedly attached Mordaunt was&#xD;
to his aunt. She had witnessed Mrs. Tryon's efforts&#xD;
to win the favor and friendship of the Mortimers dur-&#xD;
ing their visit at New York, six months before. She&#xD;
knew also Mordaunt's base"heart ; but we anticipate.&#xD;
&#xD;
Oh, how the poor girl longed to pour forth her inmost&#xD;
soul into the ear of her loved cousin; but she dare&#xD;
not! She was restrained by the thought, perhaps&#xD;
Bell will regard my tale as a base fabrication; per&#xD;
haps she will think I love Mordaunt. No, I had bet-&#xD;
ter not. Oh, if I were only certain! How little was&#xD;
she aware how much this erroneous judgment was to&#xD;
cost her cousin .Bell! Had she but spoken that&#xD;
night, Bell would have postponed indefinitely all sails,&#xD;
rides, visits, etc., and allowed Mr. Mordaunt to find&#xD;
his pleasure in the society of the gentlemen and elder&#xD;
ladies.&#xD;
"GTo-morrow," thought Clara, " I will tell her all.&#xD;
Good night ! dear Bell, good night !" and gently kiss-&#xD;
ing each other, they were soon wandering in the pleat&#xD;
sant grottoes and fairy scenes of happy dream-land.&#xD;
" Girls ahoy ! arouse thee from  thy slumbers,&#xD;
gentle fairies,! The day is just beginning. My fair-&#xD;
haired cousin Clara will, I fear, disavow all connec-&#xD;
tion with the times and customs of this country life-&#xD;
five strokes the faithful clock has sounded, and still&#xD;
she dreams. Bell, arouse thee I AhI what's that&#xD;
' Gently, gently tapping fronw a chamber door,' and&#xD;
a soft, sweet accent says, ' rWe're coming soon, dear&#xD;
Fred.' Well, all is right ! Fair ladies, when-fairly&#xD;
awake, unfairly take our senses captive; but all those&#xD;
who are worth a white moss-rose bud, know how&#xD;
to give a hungry man his daily fare, and thus balance&#xD;
the account, making it unfair to complain ofthem."&#xD;
Thus soliloquized Fred, as he returned to his room&#xD;
"Yes, yes, boy! that's fair in the main.Mn&#xD;
pays the fare and the women prepare the fare. But&#xD;
what has roused you at this hour ?"&#xD;
"Bell's orders, Uncle Harry. The Ensenore' is&#xD;

to skim the waves this morning. We, that is the young&#xD;
people, are to breakfast ab ut six'miles up the lake."&#xD;
"Well, well, man! takegood care of the freight.&#xD;
I feel considerable interest in two consignments you&#xD;
will have on board. The breeze is somewhat fresh,&#xD;
but I believe it is safe;" and Uncle Harry shuffled&#xD;
back into his room with his boots in hand.&#xD;
The party, consisting ofBell, Clara, Mr. Mordaunt,&#xD;
and Frederick, were.soon collected on the beach&#xD;
where Frederick had already prepared the graceful&#xD;
little yacht, Ensenore, belonging to his father. The&#xD;
seats' had been duly dried of the night dew; the&#xD;
mast had been stepped, and the sails were all in trim&#xD;
order, ready to be set. ..Bell's .baskets and bundles,&#xD;
of course, were not forgotten. In a few moments the&#xD;
party were gliding swiftly up the lake, under the im-&#xD;
pulse of a strong and steady northwest breeze.&#xD;
"We shall, have to beat back if this wind con-&#xD;
tinues," said Fred, who held the tiller.&#xD;
" No croaking, sir," said Bell. "This is the hour&#xD;
for fancy, eloquence, wit, sentiment "&#xD;
'5 And song-if you will allow me to ask the favor,&#xD;
Miss Mortimer," .said Mordaunt.  " We separated&#xD;
amid strains sweetly sounding ; what so dpropos as&#xD;
their echo this morning g":&#xD;
"well, Fred, thou manly Palinurus," replied Bell,&#xD;

Fred obeyed, giving the following song of old&#xD;

"no! the deep ! the deep ! with its waves to leap,&#xD;

." Capital," said Mordaunt, "and well executed.&#xD;
The sentiment chimes with the hour and the occasion.&#xD;
Is not the wind freshening somewhat ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and I am     of the opinion it is going to blow&#xD;
a  gale,"   replied   Frederick.    "I   have    anxiously&#xD;
watched the north for some time. -Already Ihave&#xD;
had to bring her head into the wind several times, to&#xD;
let the squalls pass by, so as not to disturb you by&#xD;
careening the boat.      Alone, I should not mind         a&#xD;
blow; but, with my present freight I would rather&#xD;
avoid it."&#xD;
So saying, he turned the yacht's head towards the&#xD;
eastern shore.'~ The whole party landed saf y about&#xD;

two miles short of their intended triy, and just in&#xD;
time ; for the breeze freshened so rapidly, a circum-&#xD;
stance which often happens upon the inland lakes of&#xD;
central and western New York, that there was now&#xD;
considerable danger in remaining on the water.&#xD;
"-Here is the breakfast-room," said Bell. "Gentle-&#xD;
men, you can build a fire as soon as your unaccus-&#xD;
tomed hands can accomplish it. There is a good&#xD;
place by.that heap of stones."&#xD;
In a short time, Bell, with Clara's assistance,&#xD;
showing that their home education had not been&#xD;
neglected, had an inviting breakfast prepared, with&#xD;
all the appurtenances of hot coffee, and a broiled&#xD;
beefsteak.&#xD;
"Really, young ladies, your culinary ability is&#xD;
profound," said Mr. Mordaunt. "This is enjoying&#xD;
what our, ancestors, Adam  and Eve, might have&#xD;
envied.&#xD;
"You are complimentary, certainly," said Clara;&#xD;
"but the praise belongs exclusively to my cousin&#xD;
Bell. Hers is the magic touch which has so quickly&#xD;
spread this table for you."&#xD;
Table, Clara !" said Fred, "I'd like to see even&#xD;
a mouse creep under it. There is just room for a&#xD;
well-bred grasshopper to crawl between the table-&#xD;
cloth and that part of his natural domain which the&#xD;
spread now usurps; and, when under it, I am sure&#xD;
he would be in danger of a crushing, the way these&#xD;
plates seem  to fly. Here, Mordaunt, take some&#xD;
more of this steak. One more -cup of that spicy&#xD;
aroma for me, Miss Bell, if you please."&#xD;
How you do eat, Fred!1 It is well I have a sup-&#xD;
ply for six," said Bell.&#xD;
"I require extra for being pilot. -Glad to hear of&#xD;
&#xD;
the extra supply, too ! Keep on talking ; if you have&#xD;
anything 'as. agreeable as your last remark. Here,&#xD;
Clara !. Mr. Mordaunt, will you please pass Miss&#xD;
Clara's plate, I see she has emptied it. There is&#xD;
more than one hungry, I perceive."&#xD;
"No, no! replied his cousin, I've breakfasted.&#xD;
No more for me."&#xD;
"So say I," said Mordaint.&#xD;
"And I," chimed in Fred, dwelling upon the&#xD;
pronoun, and looking around upon the viands as if&#xD;
to be certain he had really finished.&#xD;
The things were soon removed, and repacked ;&#xD;
dishes duly cleaned, etc., when, as the wind had not&#xD;
abated, Motldamt, approaching Miss Mortimer, of-&#xD;
fered his arm, proposing a stroll.&#xD;
She quietly accepted it, and looking upon Clara&#xD;
with an affectionate smile, threw her a bow, as much&#xD;
as to say, "take care of Fred"&#xD;
Clara had determined to prevent any private inter-&#xD;
view between Mordaunt and her cousin, at all&#xD;
hazards. But, again her courage failed her. True,&#xD;
she might tell Fred! but then, he too, perhaps,&#xD;
would think her selfish. Again, she failed of her&#xD;
duty. 'Fred, .naturally desirous not to interfere&#xD;
with his sister, resisted all of Clara's hints to follow&#xD;
in her footsteps, and took an opposite direction.&#xD;
When Mordaunt _had wandered from the scene&#xD;
of their breakfasting about half a mile; he came:to a&#xD;
beautiful ravine, through which a wild and: sparkling&#xD;
brooklet went leaping from rock to rock, and forming&#xD;
a thousand tiny falls. Here, under the deep shade&#xD;
of a forest tree, he prepared a seat for his companion.&#xD;
After remarking upon the wild beauty of their&#xD;
retreat, he gradually, but most skillfully, turned the&#xD;

conversation, from-the subjects which thetime and&#xD;
place naturally suggested to mere acquaintances, and&#xD;
spoke of friendship. Bell, ere she was aware,uncon-&#xD;
8ciOusly listened, her whole soul enchained, by his&#xD;
eloquence.   I&#xD;
Mss ortimer, have you ever considered why&#xD;
so much truly romantic beauty should have been&#xD;
collected in one spot, and then placed so, far out&#xD;
of reach by.the millions belonging to the human&#xD;
race?"&#xD;
"Indeed, I have not, sir; the thought is too com-&#xD;
prehensive for me; but I readily admit Athe beauty&#xD;

La.m amply repaid for undergoing the perils of&#xD;
travel," replied Mordaunt, "by the pleasure here&#xD;
&amp;amp;fe de   This i r  doubtless one of your favorite&#xD;
reteats."&#xD;
"It is, sir, when time permits me to come so far&#xD;
from home. You know, Mr. Mordaunt, my parents&#xD;
are eminentl practical in their views, and counsel&#xD;
niyelf and Frederick not, to despise labor. This&#xD;
curtails my rambling."&#xD;
"Labor ! Miss Mortimer. I thank your parents&#xD;
for that noble. sentiment which has thus reached me.&#xD;
Labor, bodily toil, is the companion of health; the&#xD;

is because each little plant, or wild and hardy shrub,&#xD;

earnestly at work. Yes! and I think,_you    uust agree&#xD;
with me, that the inhabitants of the natural world,&#xD;
pervaded by quiet, modest, earnest industry, allow&#xD;
no time for strife ; no champions for jarring prin-&#xD;
ciples; no fields upon which haughty passion and&#xD;
grasping ambition may spread the war-clad host, or&#xD;
marchthe serried column.     The, law  of love reigns&#xD;
supreme over their world. Friendship e"dsts there in&#xD;
purity. One general language pervadesthe whole=-&#xD;
here, in this lovely spot; or, at its antipodes; and&#xD;
that, Miss Mortimer, is the language of friendship,&#xD;
love and truth.&#xD;
Mordaunt, watching the effect of his words upon&#xD;
the lovely being at his side, thought that such a prize&#xD;
was, indeed, worthy an earnest struggle.&#xD;
The morning after the pic-nic party, he sat in his&#xD;
room, from the windows of which, he obtained a fine&#xD;
view of "  ayuga's lovely waters."&#xD;
"Ah 1" said he, in soliloquy, "my dear aunt and&#xD;
mother must not be       forgotten."   Preparing   his&#xD;
writing materials, he penned the. following letter.&#xD;
The reader. will learn from    its contents his plans,&#xD;
motives, and the secret springs from whence they&#xD;
flowed.&#xD;

MY DEARsT AUNT:&#xD;
aYour commands are ever the goveiming rules of my acts.&#xD;
This letter, therefore, mtist tellmy whole soul  Bell Mortimer, I&#xD;
think, will satisfy even niy fastidious taste. But I find the .coast is&#xD;
not clear. Clara Edgemonte looks upon my humble self with suspi-&#xD;

about me than she has revealed. Something prevents her from cau-&#xD;
tioning the lovely Bell against me. Bell is, therefore, thus far, unsus-&#xD;
pecting.&#xD;
Yesterday I threw out a little policy which perhaps will lead pretty&#xD;
Clara off of her beat. She has steadily persevered in preventing any&#xD;
private talk between Bell and myself, from the moment we left New&#xD;
York.  By a coup d'etat, yesterday, I oitgeneralled her.  But for&#xD;
this Clara, I should have told my tale of love yesterday. For the&#xD;
purpose of quieting Miss Clara's mind, I merely talked nonsense. We&#xD;
shall soon see what effect this will produce. I am enjoying myself&#xD;
superbly.  Frederick_Mortimer is companionable, and change of&#xD;
scene you know to be'my delight. I send to-day, per -express, a&#xD;
white French rose, to add to your collection. If my memory serves&#xD;
me, it is not 'on your list. I got it at Auburn, while on a drive there&#xD;
yesterday P.M., with Fred. Until more happens, adieu.&#xD;

Clara Edgemonte's Mistake.&#xD;
As the last was a lengthy chapter, this, for con-&#xD;
trast, shall be short.&#xD;
"Bell," said Clara Edgemonte, "you have not told&#xD;
me a word about your walk this morning, with&#xD;
Mr. Mordaunt. I have been making all the confes-&#xD;
sions. Come, fair coz, begin."&#xD;
"Oh! II had a splendid time ! Be still-don't tell&#xD;
Charley Dickens what extravagant terms I employ.&#xD;
He says, in substance, that we Americans either boil&#xD;
over with ecstasy, or freeze into solid ' chunks of&#xD;
wisdom.' He is about right; but I don't believe in&#xD;
telling him I think so."&#xD;
"Come, come; please let the dickens take Charley&#xD;
Dickens, and tell me about James Mordaunt, Esq.,&#xD;
Bell."&#xD;
In this playful way, Clara carefully drew from&#xD;
her cousin . a full history of her walk with Mor-&#xD;
daunt, conversation included. Clara saw that Mor-&#xD;
daunt had not spoken of love.  Her expectations,&#xD;
therefore, were not, realized. She was puzzled.&#xD;
Again' and again she adroitly questioned Bell, but&#xD;
nothing appeared to' have occupied Mr. Mordaunt's&#xD;
thoughts beyond a gentlemanly effort to interest and&#xD;
amuse his companion.&#xD;
" Well, I am surprised," said Clara tq herself, lean-&#xD;

ing her head upon her hand, in thought.1 " Mordaunt&#xD;
is an enigma too deep for me. Bell is, then, safe,&#xD;
and I have had my anxiety for nothing ;" and Clara's&#xD;
face began to wear a happier expression than since&#xD;
the hour she left New York. Mordaunt's skillful&#xD;
policy had completely succeeded. Clara no longer&#xD;
felt the necessity of watching over Bell's interviews&#xD;
with him. She concluded that her interpretation of&#xD;
his conduct was incorrect.&#xD;

"Pshaw! Tam, thou art brave; for I have tested&#xD;
thee under trying circumstances. It is now (looking&#xD;
at his watch) ten minutes after four. Look here,"&#xD;
(to the hostler) "how far is it to the next tavern ?"&#xD;

a gude taste ov bad road the fut four miles ov the&#xD;

Just then; two men, dressedin the garb of wood-&#xD;
choppers, entered the apology for a tavern, and&#xD;
going up to the bar, called for drinks. One of them,&#xD;
having a keen black eye, low forehead, short, coarse,&#xD;
and black hair, a.-little walnut-shaped head, dark&#xD;
complexion, rather below the medium height, but&#xD;
evidently a man of most powerful muscular develop-&#xD;
ment, after setting down his glass, approached Mel-&#xD;

half respectful, half patronizing air, said-&#xD;
" Would you like to sell that grey ov your'n?&#xD;
He's worth a cool hundred and fifty. I'll give 'that,&#xD;

" Four hundred would be no temptation, my good&#xD;
sir,"'politely replied Melville.&#xD;
"]P'raps you've an idee I can't pay down. There's&#xD;
the chink, friend " said the apparent horse-dealer, at&#xD;
the same time holding up a large roll of bank bills.&#xD;
"It won't do, sir," replied Melville.  "I am  a&#xD;
traveller, and would be obliged to obtain another&#xD;

"Want to trade hosses, then ? I'm your man for&#xD;

"No, sir, you need not; I cannot trade. Land-&#xD;

Melville and Griswold were soon mounted, and&#xD;
had entered the road already described, which led&#xD;
through a piece of woods for over ten miles. hey&#xD;
were situated , in the southern part of Alleghany&#xD;
county, and doubtless even at this day are still in&#xD;
existence,unless so much thereof as would make pine&#xD;
lumber fit for market.&#xD;

Taking a. cow-path through the woods, the high.&#xD;

peudo wood-choppers, perfectly familiar with the&#xD;
ground, by urging their horses a short time, came&#xD;

a few moments, Melville and Griswold appeared.&#xD;
"Jim,'you take the bay horse; I'll head the grey.&#xD;
Have your shootin' irons had a good supper ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Bob. Hi'm thinkin' has 'ow hif they git&#xD;
sick and throw up, one hof thim  chaps will git ha&#xD;
'ole through 'im."&#xD;
"Whist ! Jim, lie close !" hissed the ;robber called&#xD;
Bob. "Now for the grey !"&#xD;
"STirrm !" said Bob, presenting a pistol at Melville's&#xD;
breast, and grasping the rein of his horse in the left&#xD;
hand ; "your money, if you please, sir."&#xD;
"HOLD !" said Melville; "you can have the money,&#xD;
but don't fire."&#xD;
"All right, rum un ; but I guesses you may as&#xD;
well dismount, as we'll make the hoss trade now, ha,&#xD;
ha !"&#xD;
The other robber, with equal boldness, had seized&#xD;
Griswold's horse, and held him where the slightest&#xD;
effort at resistance would have been certain death.&#xD;
Melville eagerly fumbled in his pockets for hisporte-&#xD;
monnie, which, apparently, he could not find. His&#xD;
right hand went first into one pocket,. then into&#xD;
another. The left then was made to perform the same&#xD;
office. Until suddenly turning towards Griswold,&#xD;
but really keefjing his eye on the robber who held his&#xD;
rein, he called out:&#xD;
" Tam, you must have my pocket-book."&#xD;
The robber, for the instant, was thrown off his&#xD;
guard, and turned his eye in the direction of Gris-&#xD;
wold while -Melville, who had, while apparently&#xD;
fumbling in his pockets for his 'money, cocked a pis-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7805-00000030"/>&#xD;
tol, with which he was armed, suddenly drew the&#xD;
weapon, and aiming at the man who held Griswold's&#xD;
horse, fired. His own horse, unused to fire-arms, in-&#xD;
stantly bounded away from the grasp.of the robber,&#xD;
frightened at the report of the pistol. Melville turned&#xD;
to see what effect his shot had made, when he saw&#xD;
Griswold following him at the top of his horse's speed.&#xD;
Almost at the same instant he saw a flash, followed&#xD;
by a report, and felt that a bullet had struck him&#xD;
somewhere.   Perceiving no pain, he dashed on.&#xD;
Griswold soon overtook him.&#xD;
"By Jove, George, you did for my fellow,!" shout-&#xD;
ed Griswold. "He's past praying for."&#xD;
"Hold in ! Tam, this pace is killing. We are&#xD;
pretty well out of that scrape. It might have been&#xD;
an ugly affair, if my shot had not been a true one."&#xD;
An hour hence the two were housed in another&#xD;
apology for a tavern, having once more reached the&#xD;
open country.  As Melville entered the bar-room,&#xD;
taking off his hat, he discovered for the first time that&#xD;
he had a wound of some kind on his head.&#xD;
"Tam, I rather think that last shot has made its&#xD;
mark on my head somewhere. Here are two as pret-&#xD;
ty holes in my hat as I could make with hammer and&#xD;
punch."&#xD;
Well, really," said Griswold, examining his&#xD;
friend's head, "you have got a scratch which, unless I&#xD;
am ignorant of cause and effect, will keep you com-&#xD;
pany until your bones are presented with'six feet of&#xD;
ground.'"&#xD;
"Amiss is as good as a mile," carelessly respond-&#xD;
ed Melville. "Landlord,.give us a basin of water,&#xD;
and we will soon put the head in order."&#xD;
The officious tavern-keeperhastened to accommodate&#xD;
&#xD;
his guests ; but something in his manner, which even&#xD;
George afterwards could not explain, aroused suspicion.&#xD;
Taking Griswold by the arm, he strolled from the&#xD;
house (the only one for two miles around) until out&#xD;
of ear-shot.&#xD;
" Griswold !" said Melville.&#xD;
Griswold started. Melville had not thus addressed&#xD;
him since the first week of their acquaintance; but&#xD;
had always used the well-known nick-name "Tom,"&#xD;
merely changing the " o" into an "a " for the sake&#xD;
of oddity.&#xD;
" What troubles you, my friend? Are you in pain&#xD;
from your wound? Why is it not Tam as usual? Have&#xD;
I offended you unwittingly in this exciting matter&#xD;
to-day ?"&#xD;
" Offended me, my tried and trusty friend! No!&#xD;
But I will tell you what I suspect. That grey-h ad-&#xD;
ed landlord is as great a rogue as the especial friends&#xD;
we met in the wood ; and in all probability they are&#xD;
intimate associates in villainy, and perhaps murder.&#xD;
You see, then, I am araxious somewhat for the life of&#xD;
my friend; a little anxious for my own, besides hav-&#xD;
ing a care to our noble steeds. In my opinion, unless&#xD;
we are '.wise as serpents,' we shall not, be treated as&#xD;
'harmless as doves.'"&#xD;
" Let us continue our journey, and not abide here&#xD;
in the enemy's country, then," said Griswold.&#xD;
"No, that won't work. The old man could easily&#xD;
shoot us down while we were waiting for our horses.&#xD;
His plan probably is to murder us in our sleep. list!&#xD;
We are watched.. There is a boy under that log,&#xD;
continued Melville, his voice now reduced to a whis-&#xD;
per. ":Let us return to the house. You shall know&#xD;
my plan soon after supper."&#xD;

The two young men were truly in the #ery jaws of&#xD;
thewolf. The tavern-keeper was one of a gang of bur-&#xD;
glare, counterfeiters, robbers, and murderers, having&#xD;
New York city as its centre of operations, and extend-&#xD;
ing .through the great West and South., At eleven&#xD;
o'clock, the robber called Bob was admittedby a&#xD;
private entrance into the house, bearing his wounded&#xD;
companion. The admission was not so private, how-&#xD;
ever, asthe villains congratulated themselves. Mel-&#xD;
ille, determined on his plan of operations for the&#xD;
night, had retired to his room at an early hour in&#xD;
company.with Griswold, haing first provided him-&#xD;
self with a strong rope. Carefully locking the door,&#xD;
he explored the. room.. Satisfied that no one could&#xD;
enter except through the door, he told Griswold&#xD;
to extinguish the light, and place himself a sen-&#xD;
tinel in the darkest corner in the room. Then tying&#xD;
the rope to the bed-post, he lowered it carefully to&#xD;
the ground through the window.&#xD;
"Now, Tam, if you hear our old college whistle,&#xD;
you must join me immediately. If there is any&#xD;
attempt on the room, give the signal yourself, and&#xD;
descend the rope at once. I will take our traps,&#xD;
obtain the horses during the night; and we will&#xD;
leave before morning."&#xD;
All right ! I rather like this. It grows exciting,"&#xD;
repliedGriswold.&#xD;
Melville now made his descent. As he nearly&#xD;
reached the ground, his foot struck against an, empty&#xD;
cask; which, rolling over, made considerable noise.&#xD;
"cPull up the rope, quick," whispered Melville.&#xD;
Griswold obeyedlthe order only just in time ; for&#xD;
the noise attracted the tavern keeper who came fronr&#xD;
the rear of the house with a lantern.&#xD;

"What do you s'pose it was, then?  noises like that&#xD;
don't come without they's made."&#xD;
"There, I told you the old barrel had fallen off the&#xD;
heap o' stones, and there 'tis," replied an old hag, his&#xD;
wife; who accompanied him.&#xD;
"That are barrel's had some one to kick it over,&#xD;
Sally."&#xD;
"Pshaw ! no, it haint. The dog jumped on it this&#xD;
mornin', and it rolled over, for I put it back, and&#xD;
here comes Trip now. Here, Trip! .Trip ! come&#xD;
here ! You musn't roll the barrel over again-that's&#xD;
a good dog," said the old hag, addressing the latter&#xD;
half of her remarks to the dog.&#xD;
Trip came up, licked the old woman's hand, and&#xD;
received her caress. He then went to his master,&#xD;
and, fawning upon him for an instant, ran towards&#xD;
the fence, and commenced barking.&#xD;
Melville at this time lay within six feet of the dog.&#xD;
"What is it, Trip ?"&#xD;
Again the dog fawned upon him, ran  towards the&#xD;
fence, and barked.&#xD;
Melville instantly commenced crawling away from&#xD;
the house. He was near a small corn patch.&#xD;
The old man, coming to the fence, held up his&#xD;
lantern, and recognizing the moving body, in the&#xD;
uncertain light, took it for a pig.&#xD;
"There's a pig in the cornfield, Sally. Sick 'urn,&#xD;
Trip ! sipk 'um!P"&#xD;
Melville; who heard every word, resolved to act&#xD;
out the pig. He therefore made for the corn on all&#xD;
fours as rapidly as possible. Under cover of the&#xD;
corn he rose to his feet, and ran for the road, the dog&#xD;
chasing and barking at himr&#xD;
The old man and woman then returned into the&#xD;

house, followed this time by the dog, who did not&#xD;
seen to relish the effect of being stoned, a circum-&#xD;
stance for which Melville most earnestly thanked his&#xD;
good stars.&#xD;
Melville now gained a position where he could&#xD;
command a view of both entrances to the house, being&#xD;
resolved to wait and watch. By this means he be-&#xD;
came a spectator of the admission of the two robbers.&#xD;
As soon as they had entered, he resolved to seek his&#xD;
horses, rightly judging that it would take some little&#xD;
time, as well as attention from all up in'the house, to&#xD;
hear the story of the wounded man and perhaps to&#xD;
administer to his comfort. He gained the little shell&#xD;
of a barn, and, striking a light, which he kept ,burn-&#xD;
ing long enough- to see where the saddles, bridles,&#xD;
etc., were, soon had both horses in order for mount-&#xD;
ing. He then returned cautiously towards the house.&#xD;
Lights were moving about. He concluded, as every-&#xD;
thing was ready, to give Griswold the concerted&#xD;
signal. Before he could do so, however, he heard&#xD;
the whistle from the window.'. Running for the&#xD;
horses, he seized their halters, backed them  out&#xD;
quickly, mounted his own, and leading Griswold's,&#xD;
bode to the window. Griswold has ready for him,&#xD;
and catching his own horse's bridle, mounted in-&#xD;
stantly. At this moment a light appeared in the&#xD;
room just vacated by Griswold.&#xD;
"There they go, houses and all," said the robber&#xD;
called Bob. "Hand me a shooting' iron !" added he&#xD;
with an oath.&#xD;
But forthis latter sentence no blood would have&#xD;
been spilled. Melville having heard it, considered&#xD;
that self-preservation demanded the death, or, at least,.&#xD;
disabling of the. robber,'whose head and shoulders&#xD;
&#xD;
-&#xD;
&#xD;

were out of the window ; and, upon which the&#xD;
light shone clearly, making him, to Melville's really&#xD;
practised hand, a fair mark. Drawing a pistol from&#xD;
his pocket, he shouted:&#xD;
"In with your head,,or you are a dead man 1"&#xD;
The robber having received a pistol, was in the&#xD;
act of cocking it, when a ball sent by Melville struck&#xD;
him in the left shoulder. He was so far out of the&#xD;
window, that, on being struck, he pitched forwards,&#xD;
and fell headlong to the -ground, where he gave one&#xD;
heavy groan, and all was still.&#xD;
"Now, George," said Griswold, "I suppose we&#xD;
might as well start."&#xD;
"Yes," replied Melville. "It's too bad I had to&#xD;
shoot him; with the ball and the fall, he can't have&#xD;
much chance for life. One consolation I have. His&#xD;
death makes a rascal less in the world."&#xD;
"Now, Griswold; for the shire town of this ever-&#xD;
to- be-remembered. county. We must do our duty&#xD;
to society as good citizens, as well as fight bravely&#xD;
in self-defence. The lawyers must have a job.&#xD;

Sunset at Niagara-James Mordaunt's Declaration.&#xD;
IT was the hour for sunset at Niagara. Earth was&#xD;
Ientwining around the most sublime scene upon her&#xD;
bosomthe folds of darkness. The busy hum of life&#xD;
ceased with the day. The voice of Niagara, hoarse&#xD;
by a practice of ages, was heard alone where silence&#xD;
may never hold her peaceful sceptre. From time&#xD;
immemorial, that voice Chas been faithful unto the na-&#xD;

Goat Island, as all the world know, is between the&#xD;
American and Horse Shoe Falls. It is a lovely spot&#xD;
of earth. Across the seemingly fragile bridge, which&#xD;
leads to the island from the American shore, at about&#xD;
 four o'clock,r. M., James Mordaunt accompanied Miss&#xD;
Bell Mortimer for a stroll, and to view the Falls at&#xD;
sunset.&#xD;
"t each recurring visit to this island, my thoughts&#xD;
become sad," remarked Mordaunt. " It was in the&#xD;

" What was the circumstance, Mr. Mordaunt ?"&#xD;
asked Bell.&#xD;
"A man in a small boat was drawn within their&#xD;
fascinating but terrible influence."&#xD;
"I need not ask, I suppose," said Bell, ",whether&#xD;
he was drowned ?"&#xD;
"That boiling caldron yonder," said Mordaunt,&#xD;
pointing to the Horse-shoe Fall, now partly in sight,&#xD;
".has never revealed the fate it measured out to the&#xD;
poor fellow."&#xD;
It does not suit the purpose of this story to describe,&#xD;
however tempting the subject, Niagara. We are not&#xD;
bold enough to enter the lists against the mighty&#xD;
geniuses who have been tilting over the pleasing task.&#xD;
As an American, we love Niagara; but, as an Ameri-&#xD;
can, we frankly acknowledge that Niagara belongs&#xD;
to the world. So, too, thought Mordaunt.&#xD;
" That is. the English fall, Mr. Mordaunt; it is&#xD;
more extensive than the American," said Bell. "I&#xD;
don't like that."&#xD;
"You will, I trust, Miss Mortimer, allow me to&#xD;
make a slight criticism upon that remark," said Mor-&#xD;
daunt.&#xD;
" Oh-! most willingly," replied Bell.&#xD;
"With your permission, then, I will state, that in&#xD;
my judgment, 'American' and 'English' are mere-&#xD;
ly appellations for a distinction in converse. Both&#xD;
of the falls bear one general name, 'Niagara.' By&#xD;
that title they are know tothe world, anduender that&#xD;

"I thank you for this chastisement, Mr. Mordaunt,"&#xD;
replied Bell; " my remark was selfish."&#xD;
"Please call it by a softer name, my friend,; chas-&#xD;
tisement is not for gentleness, goodness, and beauty,"&#xD;
replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
"That last remark, Mr. Mordaunt, has made the&#xD;
sugar predominant over the bitter ; therefore, inas-&#xD;
much as your criticism is just, I am forced to grant&#xD;
judgment in your favor."&#xD;
"Thank you, most beautiful jurist. How well you&#xD;

here, under this beautiful foliage, is a bench which&#xD;
you can adorn without fear of a rival," replied Mor&#xD;

"A very safe proposition, Mr. Mordaunt, for the&#xD;
simple reason that no suitors will bring their cases&#xD;
here, wherefore I shall not have an opportunity to&#xD;
display my legal attainments,", playfully responded&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
"Your are mistaken, Miss Mortimer. There is one&#xD;
suitor who places his life and destiny in your hands.&#xD;
Yes,;gentle being, one who has learned first to ad-&#xD;
mire, then to esteem, now loves you-deeply; devot-&#xD;
"edly he loves you, and offers for your acceptance, his&#xD;
heart and hand, and is ready to seal the contract with&#xD;
his life's best energies devoted to your welfare.&#xD;
Uponyogrdcision, Miss Mortimer, rests the happi-&#xD;
ness of a suitor who can never love again."&#xD;
Bell was taken so suddenly and completely by sur&#xD;
praise at this most unexpected declaration of his senti-&#xD;
ments.towards .her, that for the moment she Was&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
completely overcome. Her hand, therefore, rested un-&#xD;
resistingly in his, sheering perfectly unconscious that&#xD;
he had taken it. She instantly withdrew it as thought&#xD;
returned.  The color, which had completely left&#xD;
her, now came back. The thought that she could&#xD;
never return his offered affection, mingled with some&#xD;
feelings of anger at his boldness, caused the warm&#xD;
blood to course more swiftly though her veins, spread-&#xD;
ing over her brow the marks of distress and _anx-&#xD;
iety.. Leaving the seat, she exclaimed:&#xD;
" I will return, Mr. Mordaunt."&#xD;
"Pardon me, Miss Mortimer, if I have offended&#xD;
you. The deep "&#xD;

we immediately return."&#xD;
" Let me call a-carriage ; I see an empty one," said&#xD;
Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Thank you, sir, I will ride."&#xD;
The sun, for some time had been beneath the&#xD;
horizon. The gathering darkness, as she stepped&#xD;
into the carriage, seemed to Bell Mortimer as an&#xD;
evil omen. She was not one to give vay to such&#xD;
feelings upon slight cause ; but the darkness which&#xD;
now filled her soul, awoke an indescribable fear;&#xD;
and the remembrance that "coming events often cast&#xD;
their shadows before," mingled with the loud roar&#xD;
ing of the falls, caused her to tremble.&#xD;
:" What should I fear " she asked herself. "This&#xD;
must be woman'sireakness. I must te11 him I can:-&#xD;

several times, during the ride to the hotel, she&#xD;
essayed to speak her decision. A fear, of which she&#xD;
was herself ashamed, controlled her, and she post-&#xD;
poned the subject for the morrow. Language almost&#xD;
refuses terms to describe the anguish of spirit which&#xD;
accompanied Bell that night to her pillow. She&#xD;
feared Mordaint. But, whyi This question was' ever&#xD;
present. About an hour before daybreak, she fell&#xD;
into a troubled sleep, only to awaken in a short&#xD;
time, from a horrid dream which pictured her as&#xD;
praying that she might die. Earth appeared. no&#xD;
longer to hold any joy for, her--death had become&#xD;
her only hope for release. On awakening, the poor&#xD;
girl burst into tears; and for the first time, her&#xD;
cousin Clara, who occupied the same bed, noticed&#xD;
her unhappiness.&#xD;
"Dear, dear Bell, what has caused you to weep ?"&#xD;
said.Clara.&#xD;
Gently twining her arms around Bell, Clara pressed&#xD;
her soft cheek against her cousin's,  endeavoring to&#xD;
soothe and comfort her.&#xD;
"Clara,. I am very weak !" said Bell; but the&#xD;
burning tears fell thicker and faster.&#xD;
"Do tell me what makes.you weep, dear Bell?&#xD;
I cannot endure this suspense."&#xD;
Bell now arose. Hastily putting on a morning&#xD;
eshe, threw herself again into her cousin's arms,&#xD;
nnidtold her all the events of the day previous.&#xD;
Clara listened with a painfully intense interest to&#xD;
all she had to say.&#xD;
What shall I' do? I do nqt--I cannot love him;&#xD;
and yet why this fear? What 'is it, Clara, that&#xD;
frightens me. so ?"&#xD;

She was about to speak, but at this instant there&#xD;
was a knock upon the door, and Clara's mother&#xD;
was admitted to the room. Bell turned to her toilet&#xD;
to hide her feelings from her aunt.&#xD;
"Come," girls, we are all ready for a walk. Fred-&#xD;

These, and numerous other questions of similar&#xD;
import, were rattled'off in "Uncle Harry's" business-&#xD;

any of them. Griswold was taken by surprise, as&#xD;

Mr. Edgemonte from   his boyhood as an intimate&#xD;
friend of his father. They were often connected in&#xD;
business operations, which frequently brought Mr.&#xD;
to his father's house of late years, Mr. Gris-&#xD;

trade.&#xD;

Thus Griswold replied, feeling quite proud of the&#xD;
necessities with which fortune seemed to have pre-&#xD;
sented him.&#xD;
"No! no ! no detention," replied Mr. Edgemonte.&#xD;
"On the contrary, I shall make a contract that both&#xD;
of you breakfast with me. They are all within trum-&#xD;

told from infancy that lhe was the perfect picture of&#xD;
&#xD;

GEORGE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
his father; but this was the first time the resem.&#xD;
blance had appeared to be real.&#xD;
tYour father, unless am wrong in the footing-up,&#xD;
owns a very pretty piece of land within the precincts&#xD;
of Edgartown, on the island, set down upon the&#xD;
map, as Martha's Vineyard. His name is William&#xD;
Melville, Esq., formerly a merchant of Boston, where,&#xD;
by the way, he. spends most of his winter months.&#xD;
.Am I right, sir ?"&#xD;
" You are, Mr. Edgemonte ; and I am curious to&#xD;
know more of your acquaintance with my father,"&#xD;
replied George.&#xD;
"Very well, George, come to breakfast with&#xD;
Thomas at sharp eight, and you shall learn the whole&#xD;
story. .'Hairry' and '.Bill' were titles your father&#xD;
and I have used in addressing each other, thousands.&#xD;
of times."&#xD;
George Melville was indeed surprised.   With&#xD;
Griswold, he left Mr. Edgemonte to prepare for the&#xD;
breakfast party.  - _,&#xD;
*  *e&#xD;
"Come at last! Here I've been in a terrible gale&#xD;
this twenty minutes," said Uncle Harry.&#xD;
"Why, father, what has so sexeited you?" said&#xD;
Clara.&#xD;
" Excited! Is it not a quarter past seven? Break-&#xD;
fast at eight, and you little plagues, mother, sister,&#xD;
and all, have only three quarters of an hour to get on&#xD;
your dry-goods, and balance your account with the&#xD;
looking-glass."&#xD;
Why, we are all ready now, uncle mine," said&#xD;
dell."Father and I have had a beautiful stroll;&#xD;
and there come mother and Mr. Mordaunt."&#xD;
"Well, if you girls are sure the cases are all right&#xD;

you may mail the invoices; but I'm of the opinion&#xD;
the young collegians will scrutinize all the packages&#xD;
closely ; therefore, II hope there are no mistakes.&#xD;
Don't tell me you were not fully warned-that's&#xD;
all."&#xD;
Without giving them   time for any questions,&#xD;
Uncle Harry hastily pulled out his watch, put on one&#xD;
of his unapproachable, sober faces, turned- nervously&#xD;
on his heel, and left the party, entirely deaf to the&#xD;
"Uncle Harrys" which followed him.&#xD;
"What does Uncle Harry mean, Clara ?"&#xD;
"That you, Bell, and you, my little  pet, Clara,"&#xD;
interrupted Mr. Mortimer, "are destined to meet&#xD;
with some surprise at the breakfast-table ; so run on,&#xD;
and ' pack the cases all right,' by which Mr. Edge-&#xD;
monte means, that if your toilets are not right for&#xD;
strangers, they must be made so."&#xD;
Bell and Clara, upon hearing this explanation, im-&#xD;
mediately left Mr. Mortimer, and hastened, unat-&#xD;
tended, to the hotel. Mordaunt, who was approach-&#xD;
ing with Mrs. Mortimer, seeing the young ladies -*&#xD;
leave Mr. Mortimer so unceremoniously, immediately  *&#xD;
concluded it was a ruse of Bell's to avoid his com-&#xD;
pany. The iron entered his soul.  His lips were&#xD;
suddenly and firmly compressed; his brow grew&#xD;
several shades darker; but quickly mastering him-&#xD;
self; with the ready ease of a man of the world, he&#xD;
bestowed the most delicate attentions upon Mrs. Mor-&#xD;
timer. He succeeded -so completely in 'arresting&#xD;
both Mrs. and Mr. Mortimer's attention, the'parties&#xD;
having now met, that tbie departure of. the young&#xD;
ladies was not again thought of, and consequently&#xD;
went unexplained.&#xD;

monte-The Breakfast-Party.&#xD;
IT was now ten minutes before eight. Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Edgemonte were seated in their private parlor,&#xD;
awaiting the appearance of their company. Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Mortimer were the first to enter.&#xD;
"Edgemonte, this is a capital hit. I have not k&#xD;
wanted a breakfast with such promptings of the&#xD;
innei man for some time," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Ben, do you remember 'iBill Melville?'" said&#xD;
Mr. Edgemonte, not noticing Mr. Mortimer's remark.&#xD;
",Bill Melville-Bill Melville I" said Mr. Morti-&#xD;
mer, drawing down his heavy eyebrows, and half-&#xD;
closing his eyes, as a man does who is suddenly&#xD;
carried back thirty or forty years of his life.&#xD;
"Yes? Well, he is to appear to-day, by as perfect a&#xD;
representation of himself as a son can be of a father ;&#xD;
and'a'noble looking fellow he is. If it don't carry&#xD;
you back to boyhood days, then I am no prophet."&#xD;
Bill Melville! Yes, I do remember him.      He&#xD;
was a clerk with 'Sacket &amp;amp; Waddel,' importers and&#xD;
jobers, when. Fwas an under-graduate at Columbia&#xD;
College," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGEn  MEtaVILLE.            738&#xD;
"That's right ! that's right ! He is now living&#xD;
easily at Edgartown, on Martha's Vineyard, spending&#xD;
his winters at Boston. I met a young gentleman&#xD;
from New York, son of my- old friend James H.&#xD;
Griswold, who introduced Melville to me. It seems&#xD;
they are now at Hamilton College, and are spending&#xD;
their vacation in travel.&#xD;
A rap at the door interrupted Mr. Edgemonte.&#xD;
His wife handed a couple of cards to her husband,&#xD;
brought by a waiter.&#xD;
"Show the gentlemen up, if you please, sir," said&#xD;
Mr. Edgemonte tp the waiter.&#xD;
In a few moments Mr. Griswold, accompanied by&#xD;
his friend Melville, entered the room.&#xD;
They were cordially greeted by their host. Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer immediately'recalled the features of the&#xD;
father as reflected in George Melville ; and, after the&#xD;
necessary formality of an introduction had' been&#xD;
accomplished, engaged him in conversation.&#xD;
"Mr. Melville, this is'one- of the most extraordi--&#xD;
nary fancies which the old lady 'Dame Fortune,'&#xD;
has ever seen fit to exhibit in my behalf. Your&#xD;
father, when a-young man, was one of my intimate&#xD;
friends. It is now, over thirty years since we have&#xD;
met.. I see in you the friend of my youth."&#xD;
"Your remarks bespeak a generous heart, sirof&#xD;
which I shall be proud to know more," said Melville,&#xD;
respectfully. " My father is one, too, who does not&#xD;
forget the friends of his youth."&#xD;
"Not he, not he !-but here are two young gentle-&#xD;
men with whom you must be made acquaited   Mr.&#xD;
Griswold, Mr. Mordaunt; my son Frederick. Mr.&#xD;
lMelville, gentlemen."&#xD;
The young gentlemen, having est ended to each&#xD;

other the usual courtesies of a Arst iWtro uction were&#xD;
scarely seated when the young ladies entered the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
perceive the cases' were not right," said Mr.&#xD;
Edgemonte. "Inasmuch as the corrections are all&#xD;
made;' I have no objection to invoicing the goods&#xD;
now. Mr. Melville, allow me to present youto my&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
"I am most happy at this introduction, Miss Edge-&#xD;
Monte,"said Melville, a little embarrassed, taken thus&#xD;
somewhat unawares at being unexpectedly the first&#xD;
introduced.&#xD;
"It gives me equal pleasure, Mr. Melville," grace-&#xD;
fully replied Clara, for a moment taking his hand&#xD;
and aceoinpanying the act with a smile of generous&#xD;
hospitality, which wreathed her face, plaited by na-&#xD;
te's unrivalled tueh. -"And you, Mr. Griswold!&#xD;
Fthe this isindeed a surprise."&#xD;
Clara's ountenance was instantaneously radiant&#xD;
with the most unaffected enjoyment.  I&#xD;
"But I must not forget that I l~ve acousi gen-&#xD;
tlenen"said Clara.  "Mr. Griswold, this is n&#xD;
cousin Bell. You ought to know her. Mr.Melville&#xD;
will you allow me to introduce you to Miss Morti-&#xD;
mer?"&#xD;
Benllwas not-could not be-herself. She in-&#xD;
wardlyel that smiles would only prove to be sickly&#xD;

&#xD;
Melville, at that instant, felt the warm blood course&#xD;
more quickly through his veins.&#xD;
A waiter, knocking at the door, announced break-&#xD;
fast.&#xD;
"Mr. Melville-Miss Mortimer," said Mr. Edge-&#xD;
monte, offering his arm at the same instant to Mrs.&#xD;
Mortimer. "Clara, you must take care of Mr. Gris-&#xD;
wold. Fred, you and Mr. Mordaunt must bring up&#xD;
the rear."&#xD;
With this he led the way, followed by Mr. Morti-&#xD;
mer and Mrs. Edgemonte; the rest of the party in&#xD;
the order he had designated.&#xD;
Once seated at the breakfast-table, Mordaunt, for a&#xD;
time, became the life and soul of the party. He wished&#xD;
to win the friendship of the elder portion of the com-&#xD;
pany. He' well knew that Mr. Mortimer, as an oray&#xD;
tor, had few equals, in the forum, or before his&#xD;
constituents. His style was scholastic and practical.&#xD;
Mordaunt had been a severe student ; and, in letters&#xD;
carried " an old head upon youthful shoulders." Usu~&#xD;
his advantages with a skillful touch, he succeeded&#xD;
in winning first the respect, and then the high esteem&#xD;
of Bell's 'father. Mr. Edgemonte, who could not ap&#xD;
preciate the refined, belles-lettres style, looked through&#xD;
the smile of the man, at his eye; and, through sinister&#xD;
but instantaneous glances, which Mordaunt almost;&#xD;
unconsciously allowed to mingle with his assumed&#xD;
gaiety, he read the blacknessOf the heart within.&#xD;
He had reason' for this. Bell's unusual lowness of&#xD;
spirits had been a study with Mr.'Edgemonte during&#xD;
the morning. He now saw, or thought he saw, the&#xD;
cause.&#xD;
"To-night, Mr. Melville, there is to be a soeil&#xD;

Clara. "I propose to visit your passport to that lady's&#xD;
domain.   My friend, Miss Mortimer, shall perform&#xD;
the same duty for Mr. Griswold."&#xD;
" With pleasure I accept the generous offer, Miss&#xD;
Edgemonte, and shill be only too happy to become a&#xD;
humble addition to your party."&#xD;
"I never dispute my cousin's right tp get me into&#xD;
trouble," interposed Bell, playfully, "because I find&#xD;
it does no good. Your passport, Mr. Griswold, shall&#xD;
be entirely correct. Fred, will you please become&#xD;
my private secretary, and attend to all the details ?"&#xD;
" Most certainly, Bell," replied Frederick Morti-&#xD;
mner.&#xD;
" We shall expect you, gentlemen, at 8 o'clock&#xD;
precisely," said Clara.&#xD;
Mordaunt, the morning previous,when Miss Black-&#xD;
wood's invitations came, had arranged with Bell to&#xD;
accompany her, to this very party. It was to be&#xD;
entirely young company; what is esteemed to be&#xD;
one of Young America's-follies, had been again com-&#xD;
mitted. Married ladies, the balance-wheels of youth-.&#xD;
ful enjoyment ; the happy examples for inexperience&#xD;
to study ; the splendid brilliants, polished to perfec-&#xD;
tion, were among those "not included." The am-&#xD;
bitious young lady who issues as her fiat, that mar-&#xD;
ried ladies are "not included," before her party is&#xD;
well over, will be told by experience that her beauti-&#xD;

"BOBn! in with your head; these fellows hev shown&#xD;
you as how they kin shoot. Furies! there he goes&#xD;
out o' the winder ; that shot's settled him. Run,&#xD;
Sally, run-quick !" saying these words, the tavern-&#xD;
keeper, with whom the reader is already somewhat&#xD;
acquainted, hastened down stairs and ran out beneath&#xD;
the window, where the robber had fallen. Appa-&#xD;
rently, he .was dead. Picking up the body, lie&#xD;
carried it into the house. His wife used what little&#xD;
effort she could to assist him, and afterwards to bring&#xD;
him to life. Her efforts in the latter respect, how-&#xD;
ever, were useless.-&#xD;
"This is bad bis'niss, Sally; two pals done fur in&#xD;
one day, and one as good as dead."&#xD;
"Why don't ye git out the hoss and go for a&#xD;
doctor ?" said his wife.&#xD;
"I'se thinkin' as 'ow this 'ere matter won't bear&#xD;
talking' to a doctor 'bout. You see, old 'oman, as 'ow&#xD;
thim fellers 'ul go and 'peach, and it ain't safe fur&#xD;

the work of a short time only. Getting out his&#xD;
houses, the old man lifted the two wounded men into&#xD;
the wagon. When all was ready for a start, turning&#xD;
to Sally, he said:.&#xD;
"Now, you jist drive on through the woods till&#xD;
you come to the 'big maple:' there wait for me ; I'll&#xD;
be there in 'bout an hour."&#xD;
After his wife had been gone about fifteen minutes,&#xD;
he applied a torch to the building; hastily heaping&#xD;
on some dry wood, in a few moments the building&#xD;
was in a blaze.&#xD;
"Well, you've come at last; I was gittin' a little&#xD;
feared," said the tavern-keeper's wife. "That blaze&#xD;
makes a bright light."&#xD;
"Yes, and I ain't sorry nuther. The place was&#xD;
gittin' to be suspicioned, anyhow. I've made 'nuff&#xD;
out ov it, and the land wouldn't sell fur mor'n a&#xD;
hundred dollars.  Now, we'll make for the big&#xD;
cave."&#xD;
Striking into the.wood, by a peculiarly circuitous&#xD;
winding among the trees, the old man was able to,&#xD;
drive his horses, although no road had ever been&#xD;
constructed. About daybreak, he arrived at a deep&#xD;
ravine. le was now more than ;ten miles from any&#xD;
dwelling. Near a huge rock there was an entrance&#xD;
to a large cave. No one unacquainted with the cave&#xD;
would be at all likely to discover it, as the rock was&#xD;
so completely surrounded by underbrush that the&#xD;
entrance was concealed.&#xD;
"Here is.our home for awhile, Sally; we've been&#xD;
here afore, and I'se thinking' we kin stay here again "&#xD;
The horses were unhitched, and one by one led&#xD;
int the cae. The traps were next carried in.&#xD;
Several beds were unpacked, and as soon as they&#xD;
&#xD;
OE}ORG F   tELYILLE.&#xD;
were ready, the wounded men were placed on them.&#xD;
The robber known as Bob, had given evidence that&#xD;
he was yet living. When they had been duly cared&#xD;
for, the old man took his wagon apart and carried&#xD;
that into the cave, piece by piece.. lis precautions,&#xD;
when he left the burning building, were useless&#xD;
none of his neighbors saw or knew of the fire until&#xD;
the following day. A few then came and viewed the&#xD;
ruins, pitied the old man, and wondered what had&#xD;
become of him.&#xD;
"Now, Sally, I'll saddle the mare and go fur a&#xD;
doctur; it must be did, at any cost, fur Bob's my&#xD;
right-hand man. I'd give a hundred fur one .shot to&#xD;
revenge Bob."&#xD;
,Suiting action to words, the tavern-keeper was&#xD;
soon on his way through the woods.&#xD;
*    *    *         *.   *     *    *&#xD;
"«Oh !" groaned the miserable man, who now suf-&#xD;
fered from the .effect of Melville's pistol;  oh:! I&#xD;
would like to kill the villain who put a hole in my&#xD;
shoulder. Let it alone !" he shrieked, as the doctor&#xD;
ran his probe into the wound to find the bullet. His&#xD;
cries of pain and blasphemy, however, were impotent.&#xD;
The doctor, who was a most skillful surgeon, ordered&#xD;
his patient to be firmly held. In a short time he&#xD;
found and extracted the ball. .But for the very barrel&#xD;
which had nearly discovered Melville to the tavern-&#xD;
keeper, the robber would doubtless have been killed&#xD;
by the fall. The ball had entered near his left shoul-&#xD;
der. In fall ng, he had put forward his right arm,&#xD;
- striking his hand upon the barrel in such a way, that&#xD;
it in all probability was the means of saving his life.&#xD;
The right arm was broken in two places. Having&#xD;
dressedthe wound, the surgeon set, the arm. His&#xD;

patient fainted several times during the operation ;&#xD;
but when the splints were on, he began to bear the&#xD;
pain better.&#xD;
The surgeon immediately turned his attention to&#xD;
the other robber. His wound was not so severe as&#xD;
his companion's. When his duty had been fully&#xD;
performed-if saving a.man who is ripe for the gal-&#xD;
lows can be called a duty-he said to the tavern-&#xD;
keeper:&#xD;
"It will be necessary that I come for some time ;&#xD;
you must expect me at 4 o'clock each day, until I&#xD;
give you further notice. If anything happens, you&#xD;
must leave the signal on the pine stump."&#xD;
" All right! Doctor, you're a trump, and no mis-&#xD;
take. Here's a little roll. for you, which, in this&#xD;
cause, goes as easy and a .little freer than it kum.&#xD;
No questions answered, doctor ; mum's the word ;&#xD;
and we shall be mutu'ly profitable."&#xD;
The doctor counted over the money.&#xD;
"One hundred," said he; "it's more than I want."&#xD;
"Keep it ! keep it ! andl there's another ready for&#xD;

that kind, to keep you single. But seriously, Bell,&#xD;
you decide correctly'. Mordaunt is a cold schemer.&#xD;
If you are ever so silly as to commit matrimony, you&#xD;
must have a heart. He has splendid talents, but&#xD;
you would fade in a few years as his wife."&#xD;
"Fred, I fear him."&#xD;
"Fear- him ! why-?  Send him  about his busi-&#xD;
ness, and remember you have a brother Frederick.&#xD;
Bell, I must go and dress up."&#xD;
"The cold schemer, Fred, may prove a deep vil-&#xD;

"Forewarned, you are forearmed."&#xD;
"But father likes him, and mother has taken up&#xD;
his cause ; either having been spoken to by him, or&#xD;
having divined herself my secret."&#xD;
"The former, inost likely, Bell. That would never&#xD;
be like mother. She is not one to look out. in&#xD;
advance for such nonsense.  Kiss me, Bell; and&#xD;
then go and send him about his business. He is&#xD;
now waiting for you in our parlor."&#xD;
"'I will do so ; but promise, Fred, never to forsake&#xD;
ee, if that business proves to be my persecution."&#xD;
"A promise as easily kept as it is solemnly made;,&#xD;
for I assure you, Bell, my heart is against him."&#xD;

"Good afternoon, Mr. Mordaunt," said Bell, en-&#xD;
tering the parlor.&#xD;
"Good afternoon, Miss Mortimer," replied Mor-&#xD;
daunt, with his most winning smile. "This rain-&#xD;
tom is likely to dampen the ardor of the party-&#xD;
goers."&#xD;
"Do you think it will continue,shr '?"&#xD;
"I cannot say, not being weather-wise.  ityor&#xD;
wish, Miss Mortimer, that it abate ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"If my reply were based upon Bslfisness, it&#xD;
would be, No, sir !"&#xD;
"Io you not desire, then, to incur :the Arouble f&#xD;

fully into the pleasures of the hour, and became, as&#xD;
he could whenever he chose, the life of the party.&#xD;
Clara was' surprised at Bell's vivacity.  Mordaunt&#xD;
was happy, because he deemed that his chances for&#xD;
gaining, Bell's hand had risen fifty per cent. Mrs.&#xD;
Edgemonte talked of the wonderful influence which&#xD;
music had in dispelling engi , and remarked, that&#xD;
she thought herself entitled to a vote of thanks from&#xD;
the entire company. How was it with Bell? Her&#xD;
spirits were the result of a final judgment in.regard&#xD;
to Mr. Mordaunt's proposal. The conversation with&#xD;
her brother, his prompt advice and coinciding opin-&#xD;
ion, had relieved her mind of the indefinable fear&#xD;
which had hitherto controlled her. Mordaunt's sud-&#xD;
den renewal of the subject had displeased her. She&#xD;
regarded it in the light of assumption. His very&#xD;
language betrayed to her nice perception that, under&#xD;
seeming humility, the roots of bold and haughty&#xD;
arrogance existed, ready to germinate and choke out&#xD;
the assumed devotion. The rain now fell in torrents.&#xD;
Mrs. Edgemonte had warned the young ladies that&#xD;
it was nearly time for the evening meal. Clara and&#xD;
Bell had just concluded a beautiful duet. Mr. Mor-&#xD;
daunt was. lavish in his praises of the sentiment,&#xD;
music, :and execution, when Frederick 'Mortimer&#xD;
entered the room.&#xD;
"Lively again at last, Bell? Come, give us another&#xD;
song," said Fred.&#xD;
" Can't possibly. It is time to prepare for the tea-&#xD;
table;" replied Bell.&#xD;
"That is such an unpoetical excuse I cannot ac-&#xD;
cept it ;" and Fred insisted on the song..&#xD;
The young ladies gratified him, but this time at&#xD;
the expense of an extra accompaniment ; for, before&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
they had concluded the last verse, the gong sounded&#xD;
the hour for tea.&#xD;
"That gong makes the same impression on the&#xD;
music. as the rain, this afternoon, has made upon my&#xD;
spirits," said Fred-" a damper in each instance."&#xD;
"Bell," said Clara, looking out of the window,&#xD;
"there is no sign of clear weather."&#xD;
" It pours," remarked Fred, looking significantly&#xD;
at his sister. "Will you attend the party to-night ?"&#xD;
Mordaunt almost- held his breath to hear Bell's&#xD;
answer to this question. Bell, fixing her eye upon&#xD;
Mordaunt, with a quiet but expressive smile, re-&#xD;
marked-&#xD;
"I shall brave the Storm King's power, and do my&#xD;
best to shine at Miss Blackwood's. Mr. Mordaunt,&#xD;
if the weather is too severe for you, my father will&#xD;
attend to all my wants."&#xD;
" By no means, Miss Mortimer. I cannot resign&#xD;
the privilege of. accompanying you, as arranged," re-&#xD;
plied Mordaunt, in an even tone of voice, which be-&#xD;
trayed nothing of the whirling torrent of passion&#xD;
which had been set in motion by Bell's remark.&#xD;
Iordaunt then recalled his words, before Mrs. Edge-&#xD;
monte had so inopportunely interrupted him. He&#xD;
saw that Bell had read his thoughts without listening&#xD;
to his words. He saw, too, that he had committed a&#xD;
serious error in policy, and awakened in Bell a con-&#xD;
tempt for himself. To any man not controlled by&#xD;
the Christian virtues, contempt breeds dislike. To&#xD;
a man of Mordaunt's pride and self-love, contempt&#xD;
awakens to life a hatred which knows not fatigue, and&#xD;
spares not expense ; when foiled, rises stronger from&#xD;
the unwilling respite to mount the wild war steed&#xD;
of a more craftypolicy,; again and again to shun the&#xD;

&#xD;
eneumter, until the victim is within a  ure grasp&#xD;
Then it gives no quarter, unless it be to sip the&#xD;
vWeets of revenge in the cup of lingering torment.&#xD;
Tea over, Fred    sought Bell's apartment.    Re&#xD;
learned from her all that had passed, and resolved to&#xD;
become himself his sister's attendant. Clara entered&#xD;
and asked him about the arrangements.&#xD;
"Bell, Mr. (Griswold, Mordaunt, and my humble&#xD;
self," replied Fred, "will make one carriage load.&#xD;
Clara and Mr. Melville may form the second; though&#xD;
I don't exactly fancy giving Mr. Melville so much to&#xD;
be proud of as a ride solus with, so much natural&#xD;
loveliness. But some men are born lucky; and ti&#xD;
time the old saw applies to this youth collegiate.&#xD;
Stop ! stop, Clara! Don't pull my ears, hair, whisk-&#xD;
ers; no, ned nor       Well, if you' don't like the&#xD;
arrangement, take that (stealing a kiss from his beau-&#xD;

forced to ride alone with a young man who wears&#xD;
the impress of true American nobility. Hem! Can't&#xD;
you give me another kiss, Clara, for my eloquence?&#xD;
It's due! Well, if you 'won't, you-won't; and there's&#xD;
the end on't.'    And he left the young ladies to&#xD;
make their toilet.&#xD;
Fred's arrangement was fully carried out.    Not-&#xD;
withstanding the storm, Miss Blackwood's house&#xD;
as  well filled. Bell Mortimer was 'decidedly the&#xD;
most beautiful woman in the room (we like that good&#xD;
old-fashioned title, and respect "Old Bullion's "*&#xD;

and the Bible, to the contrary, notwithstanding):&#xD;
The entree into the parlors being successfully ac-&#xD;
complished, as the dancing had not commenced, the&#xD;
hotel party became a little separated. Miss Black-&#xD;
wood, feeling that Mr. Mordaunt was one who&#xD;
demanded at her hands especial attention, as the&#xD;
intinlate friend and travelling companion of a Aistin-&#xD;
guished statesman, became somewhat excessive m&#xD;
her attentions to him. Some further trifling circuim-&#xD;
stances brought Mr. Melville and Miss Mortimer&#xD;
together. At this instant, the music. began a qua-&#xD;
drille, Mordaunt being still engaged by aMiss Black-&#xD;
wood.&#xD;
"I see Mr. Mordaunt will probably not claim you&#xD;
for this dance, Miss' Mortimer. Will you accept so&#xD;
poor a partner as I am able to offer ?" said Melville.&#xD;
" With pleasure, sir," said Bell, gently lifting the&#xD;
folds of her dress, and placing her hand upon Mel-&#xD;
ville's arm.&#xD;
Melville was at that moment envied by half the&#xD;
gentlemen in the room.&#xD;
"Excuse me, if you please, Miss Blackwood, Miss&#xD;
Mortimer will be waiting for me, to go through this&#xD;
quadrille," said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Certainly, Mr. Mordaunt," replied Miss Black-&#xD;
wood, her lip curling slightly as, at the same instant,&#xD;
she recognized Bell's movements with Melville.&#xD;
Before Mordaunt' could turn and address Bell, the&#xD;
dance had commenced. Clara was also dancing, with&#xD;
Mr. Griswold in- another set. Returning, therefore,&#xD;
to Miss Blackwood, Mordaunt endeavored to engage&#xD;
her in conversation. She was, in terse phrase, dis-&#xD;
tantly polite: monosyllabic, with an occasional smile&#xD;

MORDAUNT, on returning to the hotel, wrote a long&#xD;
letter to his aunt before he slept.        He gave her, in&#xD;

would do     all in his power to make the issue of his&#xD;

after he received the following note :&#xD;
No. - FIFTH AVENUE, NEw YORK, Augu8t 18th, 18-.-&#xD;
MY DEAR JAMES:&#xD;
Your letters of the ---inst., from Aurora, and of the -&#xD;
inst., from Niagara, are received.  You are in trouble, and not by&#xD;
any fault of commission on your part that I can now perceive. Bell&#xD;
has evidently made her brother a confidant. You must get hidp out&#xD;
of your way. Clara Edgemonte is your bitter enemy, from some pre-&#xD;
vious knowledge of you. Find out hei- secret if possible. You will&#xD;
then be able to countermine any efforts she may make to prejudice&#xD;
Bell against you. 'Melville may be attracted by your fawn. Neglect&#xD;
no opportunity to find his weak points, and show him up. Tom Gris-&#xD;
wold may be of use to you. Play the dear friend with him; draw&#xD;
him into your confidence until you can obtain from him the secret&#xD;
little misdeeds which bften surround such gay young men as is Mel-&#xD;
ville. I shall visit Aurora infue time. The real battle, I am satis-&#xD;
fied, will be against George Melville. All are well at home.&#xD;
In haste. -Your affectionate aunt,&#xD;

00          GEORGE MELTILLE.&#xD;
Mordauint read and re-read this note. The idea&#xD;
that, Bell had conceived an interest for Melville was&#xD;
the point in it which caused him the severest thought.&#xD;
His reflections took the following turn:&#xD;
"'Melville is a mere youy-not much.r senior-&#xD;
just Qut of his junior year in colle g -evidently no&#xD;
student. Bell must wait years before he can afford&#xD;
to marry, if his father designs him foreither of the&#xD;
professions. But Aunt Sarah's words ar   let me&#xD;
see," and taking up her note for the twentiethliime,&#xD;
he repeated the.following sentence:&#xD;
"The real battle, I am satisfled, will be against&#xD;
George Melville."  Throwing himself back in his&#xD;
chair, and covering his face with both hands, Mor-&#xD;
daunt: sat some time in deep thought. He recalled&#xD;
every word, look, action, which had passed between&#xD;
Bell and Melville. The result seemed to end in=&#xD;
absolute proof that his aunt was wrong. Arising, he&#xD;
said aloud:&#xD;
" Aunt Sarah, for once, is wrong. It is the first&#xD;
time she has erred since I have known her; therefore&#xD;
I shall watch. Melville appears to be an unoffending&#xD;
youth. For all I yet know, we may be friends. But&#xD;
if she scorns my love to bask in his smiles, my re-&#xD;
venge shalfprove sweeter than lIve's dalliance, even&#xD;
with Bell Mortimer ;" and he suddenly arose, and&#xD;
walkedseveral times heavily and proudly across the&#xD;
rooxi, with head thrown back, and lip firmly com-&#xD;
pressed.&#xD;
"Now for a cigar; a stroll, -and-.  thought."&#xD;
Taking the. path which leads to Goat Island,'he&#xD;
wandered along, unheeding the various knots of&#xD;
visitors which he met, representatives of every state&#xD;
and eline.. A~t this time, Niagara was surfeited with&#xD;

GEORGE MELVILtE.&#xD;
travellers. Ilie walked on, unmindful of time or&#xD;
fatigue, until the gath'eri darkness caused him to&#xD;
look at his watch ; it was fifteen minutes after eight.&#xD;
He was now within a short distance of the very&#xD;
bench where first he had declared his love to Bell.&#xD;
As. he gradually approached the spot, a voice pro-&#xD;
nounced the following words:&#xD;
"My dear-language "&#xD;
The remainder of the sentence was lost. Stopping,&#xD;
he listened more attentively, when a voice, which he&#xD;
instantly recognized- as Bell Mortimer's, spoke, and&#xD;
evidently with much agitation. The following words&#xD;
were all he could hear distinctly:&#xD;
-" to love  Rvilain-precaution1"&#xD;
The first voice, which Mordaunt now recognized to&#xD;
be Griswold's, again spoke. Mordaunt heard the&#xD;
following:&#xD;
" Oh, Miss Mortimer ! I warmly love--most dearly&#xD;
love&#xD;
This was replied to by Bell. Mordant again&#xD;
heard but part of the sentence:&#xD;
" work of a higher power. But we had better&#xD;
return. Suppose you 'dismiss the carriage. I pro-&#xD;
pose a walk home."&#xD;
"With pleasure," replied Griswold.&#xD;
Mordaunt walked noiselessly in a direction to&#xD;
avoid what he now deemed to be the two lovers.&#xD;
Bell's pleasure on the rainy afternoon; hert determi-&#xD;
nation to go through a violent storm .rather than&#xD;
spend an evening with himself; her conduct at the&#xD;
party-all was now explained, as he thought.' Aunt&#xD;
Sarah was wrongI The real battle, I am now sati-&#xD;
fed, will be with Grirwold," said he.&#xD;

&#xD;
and James Mordaunt met in the shaving-saloon of&#xD;
the, hotel.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mordaunt," said Fred.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mortimer," replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
a  have beaten you on the .course this morning by&#xD;
a .kave, you perceive."&#xD;
" Yes," said Mordaunt, "and I perceive' also that&#xD;
it has been a close shave."&#xD;
"Thattis owing to getting wide awake before you,&#xD;
Mr. Mordaunt-. Always have been an early riser&#xD;
whenever I failed to sleep late. But what has ar-&#xD;
roused you thus early ?"&#xD;
" I am bound for New York," replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
"It is impossible to believe that," said Fred.&#xD;
"There are two rides this day, and one pic-nic; to-&#xD;
morrow a trip! in the 'Maid of the Mist,' and a visit&#xD;
to 'Table Ro;' evening at Mrs. Jones's---the Mrs.&#xD;
Jones's. Go, if you dare, sir."&#xD;
"And 'dare' I must; for I am the forlorn hope;&#xD;
stormers, reserve column, sappers and miners, etc.,&#xD;
etc.-in fact, the whole army-and New York is the&#xD;
breach. Business, Mr. Mortimer, before pleasure "&#xD;
Yes," interrupted Fred, " as. the old deacon,&#xD;
hoeing corn while his neighbors were attending his&#xD;
wife's funeral, once quietly remarked. I wonder if&#xD;
the deacon, after he had cleared the weeds from the&#xD;
corn-field, was decent enough to sport one for&#xD;
m7ourn'ilng."&#xD;
"Ie ought to have done so," said Mordaunt, "for&#xD;
a wife who succeeded in making her husband remem-&#xD;
ber her so affectionately, ought to have been em-&#xD;
balmed. The example of Socrates, in his treatment&#xD;
of Xantippe, puts many a man to blush for scolding&#xD;
the woman he has sworn to cherish."&#xD;
&#xD;
"&#xD;
&#xD;
Mordaunt, that !day, took the earliest train en route&#xD;
for New York. We will follow him.&#xD;
"Are you certain, James, that Tom Griswold has&#xD;
proposed for, and been accepted by, Bell Mortimer ?"&#xD;
"Y es."&#xD;
"What is the proof, James ?"&#xD;
"My own ears, and my own eyes-two very trusty&#xD;
servants. The carriage was dismissed. They walked&#xD;
to the hotel. When I made my proposal, in the&#xD;
same place, Bell pretended to be terribly frightened&#xD;
-rode home-would not speak, and all thatnon-&#xD;
sense.&#xD;
"Well, Griswold is not so large game, and, conse-&#xD;
quently, not as worthy your steel; but, if you don't&#xD;
get the fair Bell just now, by postponing any con-&#xD;
summation of Griswold's desires, you will gain time&#xD;
to fight the battle of Cupid with Miss Bell. Gris-&#xD;
wold is now in college. He must graduate. You&#xD;
have thus one year. He must study a profession.&#xD;
Two more years from   that, at least.  Griswold's&#xD;
father, you say, is worth about two hundred thou-&#xD;
sand, or thereabouts. Three years-three years-let&#xD;
me consider. Yes, that's your only way. When the&#xD;
three years are up, James, Griswold's father, must be&#xD;
a bankrupt."&#xD;
"That will do! By Jove! and a bankrupt he&#xD;
shall be, in less time than that. Aunt Sarah, here's&#xD;
the sweetest kiss I ever gave you yet."&#xD;
"Tell me your plan," replied Mrs. Tryon.&#xD;
'K It is not matured sufficiently. The outlines are&#xD;

request, will investigate, of course, and give their&#xD;
opinion. Being favorable, Griswold will catch at&#xD;
the bait, and go to smash."&#xD;
"Yes, but the railroad; where is that ?"&#xD;
"That is the main spoke in the wheel, good aunt,&#xD;
and my part, of the work. It will take one or two&#xD;
years of long and patient head-work for me to bring&#xD;
that into a fixed fact: I shall endeavor to manage&#xD;
the whole affair so as to make a profitable result for&#xD;
myself. In that case, revenge will become durable&#xD;
as gold."&#xD;
"Very well," said his aunt. "In the interim, you&#xD;
must play the mournful, discon8olate, rejected suitor.&#xD;
Silent. proofs of love's enduring, throbbing, thrilling,&#xD;
absorbing pathos, must be scattered in Bell's path-&#xD;
way. Finally, the ring of your, praises as a rising&#xD;
lawyer, an able speaker, a man of influence, must be&#xD;
made to sound distinctly in the ears of Hon. B. F.&#xD;
Mortimer."&#xD;
Mordant having marked out his course, entered&#xD;
immediately upon the plans necessary to a successful,&#xD;
result. He. projected a railroad from the village of&#xD;
P., for one of the termini, to a beautiful bay on&#xD;
the southern shore of Lake Ontario, for the other.&#xD;
ItWas to cross the New York Central Railroad, at&#xD;
thcity of --. The plan of' this roadwas based in&#xD;
&#xD;
a ORGE MELVILLE..&#xD;
&#xD;
95"_&#xD;
&#xD;
?u=9&#xD;
&#xD;
is&#xD;
&#xD;
wisdom. There was sufficient necessity for the road.&#xD;
Once built, it must pay a good per cent. on the&#xD;
cost. But Mordaunt well knew that before the road&#xD;
could be constructed, every dollar invested in the&#xD;
original securities of the company, would be irre-&#xD;
trievpbly lost.&#xD;
HQ now visited nearly every town on the main/&#xD;
routes in southern and western New York. He&#xD;
made himself practically familiar with their localities,&#xD;
wants, and resources. Having matured his project,&#xD;
he next opened negotiations with the principal&#xD;
moneyed men, resident in the counties through&#xD;
which the road was to pass. Gaining their favor in&#xD;
its behalf, he enlisted the members of the press along&#xD;
the line to present the subject to the people. In a&#xD;
short time the bait took ; every man, woman, and&#xD;
even child old enough to lisp railroad was talking&#xD;
about the immense value which the railroad would&#xD;
add to the land; ambitious young ladies asked pa for&#xD;
a little more expensive dresses on the strength of the&#xD;
rise; and foolish pas actually extended their family&#xD;
expenses a couple of hundred or more per annum.&#xD;
The whole community went railroad mad. Great&#xD;
railroad mass meetings were held by the people.&#xD;
Mordaunt was careful, however, never to have his&#xD;
name appear in any of the public calls. His plea&#xD;
with the managing gentlemen was, "Oh, I am no&#xD;
speaker. I promise, gentlemen; to take $300,000&#xD;
first securitiesupon the road, as soon as you have&#xD;
a subscription list of an .equal amount. You can&#xD;
have my bond for the fulfillment of that promise&#xD;
with any sureties you. may ask."&#xD;
The bond was duly prepared. Mordaunt was&#xD;
playing a bold game ; but he had fully calculated&#xD;
&#xD;
r 1&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
his chances. With his aunt's name as security for&#xD;
his sureties, he had no difficulty in obtaining respon-&#xD;
sible names. Everything being fully ripe for starting&#xD;
the project, he applied to the legislature for a charter.&#xD;
For want of a better alias, for it will not suit our&#xD;
purpose to give the true name of this railroad com-&#xD;
pany, as its present interests may be seriously&#xD;
affected by thus making an expos of its early history,&#xD;
we shall call it "Tun NEw YoRK CATFISH RAILROAD&#xD;
Co." Under that name it was duly chartered by the&#xD;
legislature. The stock list was rapidly filled up.&#xD;
The city of  -applied to the legislature for an acf&#xD;
authorizing it to loan its credit to the road. By this&#xD;
means the company filled up the required $300,000.&#xD;
Before this was accomplished, however, the work of&#xD;
surveying, grading, etc., had been commenced, and&#xD;
steadily prosecuted. At this time, not a voice in&#xD;
any county, through which the road passed, could.&#xD;
be found to decry, or even doubt the success of the&#xD;
road. Land had risen twenty-five per cent. in value,&#xD;
and some sales had actually been consummated at,&#xD;
frightfully fabulous prices. Mordaunt carefully used&#xD;
every influence to obtain the assistance of the New&#xD;
York city press. Without that potent engine he&#xD;
well knew he stood little chance of disposing of his&#xD;
$300,000 worth of the stock.&#xD;
The time came at last for him to fulfill the condi-&#xD;
tions of his bond. He nerved himself to the task.&#xD;
The bonds of the company were made out. He wished&#xD;
to throw 1tie odium of the final collapse off from his&#xD;
holders, and accomplish the ruin of James H. Gris-&#xD;
wold.&#xD;
&#xD;
xv.&#xD;
Ahead-Back again.&#xD;
Two years had passed since Mordaunt first started&#xD;
upon his scheme of revenge. During that time he&#xD;
had made frequent visits at Aurora; had twice ven-&#xD;
tured to press his suit with Bell. Mr. Mortimer had&#xD;
become interested in the railroad scheme, and had&#xD;
invested .a small sum in the stock. He used every&#xD;
argument in his power to. change Bell's decision in&#xD;
Mordaunt's favor. Mrs. Mortimer was equally his&#xD;
friend. Bell was inflexibly opposed to him.&#xD;
Upon two occasions, during the second year, al-&#xD;
ready mentioned, Mordaunt had met Griswold and&#xD;
Melville at Mr. Mortimer's residence. Their inter-&#xD;
course had been characterized by the utmost of seem-&#xD;
ing friendship. Rides, sailing parties, pic-nics, etc.&#xD;
etc., well known as among the amusements of the&#xD;
country, had been enjoyed together in profusion,&#xD;
without an exhibition .of the slightest trace of that&#xD;
revenge which prompted James Mordaunt's every&#xD;
thought. Mr. Edgemonte, with his wife and daugh-&#xD;
ter Clara, were in Europe. Thomas Griswold was&#xD;
reading law with a well known firm in New York&#xD;
city.. George Melville was studying medicine at&#xD;
Pittsfield, Mass.&#xD;

Bell's parents that Griswold was her accepted lover&#xD;
In' this he had acted contrary to his aunt's, Mrs.&#xD;
Tryon's, advice. On several occasions, he had seen&#xD;
enough to satisfy him, that Griswold was, indeed,&#xD;
the preferred lover. At all events he could watch..&#xD;
He could know. By any premature opening- of this&#xD;
subject to the Mortimers, he would be unable to&#xD;
bring to bear in his own favor the effect of Mr.: Gris-&#xD;
wold's bankruptcy  The sowing was nearly ripened&#xD;
for the harvest. One month was to elapse ere. he&#xD;
would be called upon to fulfill his contract with the&#xD;
"New York Catfish Railroad Company."&#xD;
"Now, aunt, the field is ripened for the sickle; I&#xD;
start for Aurora to-morrow, in the evening train. You&#xD;
are to accompany me, according to promise. We shall&#xD;
stop at the city of Auburn one day. I desire to visit&#xD;
the 'Auburn State Prisoln.'"&#xD;
"Very well; that is all satisfactory. I shall be&#xD;
ready and willing. You well know, my dear James,&#xD;
I live only for your happiness."&#xD;
While Mordaunt and his aunt are pursuing their&#xD;
jaunt to the city of Auburn, we will take the reader&#xD;
back to Goat Island, at Niagara:&#xD;
lIt was evening of the day subsequent to Mr. iMor-&#xD;

with Frederick Mortimer, in the barber's saloon.&#xD;
A carriage was slowly passing through the various.&#xD;
winding paths of that island. Within it was seated&#xD;
a beautiful young lady. Her face, wreathed with&#xD;
smiles of sunshine, gave token of happy thought; the&#xD;
rich blood mounted from-her beating heart, causing&#xD;
the crimson, tell-tale blushes to reveal the proud af-&#xD;

has given her maiden heart, accompanying the gift&#xD;
with its pure and truthful devotion. Her fair white&#xD;
hand, freed from its tiny silken glove, was gently&#xD;
held by Thomas Griswold. Around her beautiful&#xD;
form his arm had gently entwined, and once again&#xD;
he fondly, ardently pressed the lovely being to his&#xD;
bosom, sealing anew his plighted vows.&#xD;
"Dearest, dearest Clara, how sweet this cup of&#xD;
happiness after so long a separation ! May kind&#xD;
Heaven grant that nothing shall ever disturb the&#xD;
quiet joy which now fills our hearts! How strange&#xD;
our meeting ! I wrote you from Clinton, that duty&#xD;
called me to accompany my friend Melville.- He has&#xD;
a noble heart. His health was failing, and go upon&#xD;
this Quixotic adventure without me, he would not.&#xD;
I had a sore trial between love and duty. His father&#xD;
wrote, entreating- me to accompany his son. Duty&#xD;
won the battle, and I wrote to you that we could not&#xD;
meet until the holidays."&#xD;
."I wrote, dear Thomas, asking you to meet me&#xD;
here. That letter, with four pages of foolish affec-&#xD;
tion, awaits, your entrance upon senior dignity."&#xD;
"The dignity has not come yet ; true. I must not&#xD;
'forget that fact," said Griswold, fondly pressing his&#xD;
beautiful prize again to his bosom.&#xD;
This scene is too sacred to be further revealed.&#xD;
Now that the reader has learned Clara's and Gris-&#xD;
wold's secret, we ask as an especial favor that it be kept&#xD;
a secret ; at least please, do not inform any of the per-&#xD;
sonages who figure in these pages. Such a revelation&#xD;
might create infinite mischief.&#xD;

Who is Uncle Sam ?-Syracuse--Camillus-Junction-Auburn-A&#xD;
New York Lawyer obtains a Case (a hard one).&#xD;
" Tm old sinner, Jim, has burnt "up his den, and&#xD;
removed all traces. There's wagon tracks goin' to-&#xD;
wards the woods. -P'raps he ain't fur off."&#xD;
"What's best to be done, Bill ?"&#xD;
Wal, I dunno, Ike, We might sarch the woods&#xD;
fur the trail, Injun fashion;' but ef we don't find him,&#xD;
the laugh'll be agin us."&#xD;
"Ef we do, Bill, the prase won't amount to straws.&#xD;
Let's kind ar look, then go home. Ef we find any&#xD;
track, let's see where it'll come to, and then, when&#xD;
the reward is offered, we'll stand a-pooty fair chance&#xD;
ov makin' a strike."&#xD;
The above dishonest determination seemed to suit&#xD;
two worthies who carried the warrants of arrest&#xD;
against the bodies of John Halter, and his wife Sally&#xD;
Halter, the tavern-keeping friends of Melville and&#xD;
Griswold, Bob Shank, alias William Tibbles, and&#xD;
James Strigham, the two wounded men, who at this&#xD;
moment were groaning in the cave. After searching&#xD;
the woods a short time, the constables came upon the&#xD;
wagon track, where it had entered the wood. Care-&#xD;
fullyfollowing it, they traced the route of the robbers,&#xD;
for sinch we may as well call them, to the cave. After&#xD;
&#xD;
1a&#xD;
tI i&#xD;
.4&#xD;
A54&#xD;
&#xD;
being fully satisfied that Halter would not move very&#xD;
soon, they left the wood without making an arrest.&#xD;
"We've treed the coons, Ike, and they'll stay&#xD;
treed for awhile. Now, let's wait 'till a reward's pf-&#xD;
fered," said the constable called Bill.&#xD;
Such a specimen of dishonesty on the part of consta-&#xD;
bles in the United States we say, with pride, is rare.&#xD;
The instance above recorded has had, however, its&#xD;
foundation in fact. We believe the remark will be&#xD;
within bounds, that honesty, efficiency, and prompti-&#xD;
tude characterize the American police. When it is&#xD;
remembered that the people rule in America, that&#xD;
the institutions of the country admit no landed mono-&#xD;
polies, that the agriculturist who owns ten, twenty, fif-&#xD;
ty, or a hundred acres, and their name is legion, holds&#xD;
equal power with him who can count his millions, the&#xD;
necessity for a police diminishes. Every land-holder is:&#xD;
in one sense a policeman. He is a law-abiding -citi-&#xD;
zen. He knows that his individual sovereignty is&#xD;
contravened whenever a villain escapes punishment.&#xD;
The great world abroad do not comprehend America.&#xD;
They cannot yet see the basis upon which her stabi-&#xD;
lity rests. Uncle Sam is a myth-a sprite-a wraith.&#xD;
He has placed his sons and daughters in a mighty&#xD;
caldron, into which a steady stream from the foun-&#xD;
tain of knowledge continually is running. True,&#xD;
fiery ambition, the scorching heat of contending pas-&#xD;
sion, the seething throes of jarring principle, whenever&#xD;
the quadrennial fires arouse the mass to a boiling tem-&#xD;
perature, rise upon the surface, simmering, snapping,&#xD;
spiteful; but° where the crisis seems to be fearful,&#xD;
" Uncle Sam" callsup "Mose," who,. mounting his&#xD;
"machine," orders the suction to be set in the reser-&#xD;
voir of coinmon sense, and seizing his trumpet,&#xD;

last departing steamer has borne the news of fearful&#xD;
commotion to luxurious halls, graced by prince, king,&#xD;
and emperor, " Mose" has put the fire out, and&#xD;
stands, with hat awry, half-drawn over his eyes, reu-&#xD;
shirt, pants rolled up, hands in his pockets, telling&#xD;
"as how No. 4 never wet her hose."&#xD;
*      *      *      *       *      *&#xD;
"Where abouts, doctor, is the place you say them&#xD;
nabs was ?"&#xD;
" I met them in the woods, about half a mile from&#xD;
the road. They were making a mark on a tree as if&#xD;
to help remember some route, or I should have been&#xD;
seen. As they passed, I heard them say that they&#xD;
had 'treed the coons.'"&#xD;
"That means me, doctor. The cave must be 'vac-&#xD;
uated. Thy've followed the wagon track."&#xD;
Halter left the doctor to examine his patients in&#xD;
the. cave, and went out himself to look for foot-&#xD;
marks. He soon traced out the trail of the two con-&#xD;
stables.&#xD;
" Here 'tis ; and now, ef they catches this chicken&#xD;
they's welcome to give him a fancy neck-tie," said&#xD;
the tavern-keeper in soliloquy.&#xD;
*      *      *      *      *     *       *&#xD;
"Good bye, doctor. You'll git a signal at your&#xD;
house where to find me. It's hard to move them&#xD;
coves; but right's right, and they's got ter stand it.&#xD;
Doctor, here's that tother hundred, for you've saved&#xD;
my whole family from capitulatin' to the inemy on&#xD;

"I cannot accept this, Halter. You have already&#xD;
paid me more than my bill yet amounts to. Here;&#xD;

" No, siree! Every dollar would rise up in judg-&#xD;
ment agin me, and say, Why didn't you gin us to&#xD;
the doctor? that money's all extra! The tother hun-&#xD;
dred's ready whin the pashunts is konvaleesunt."&#xD;
After the doctor's departure, Halter set about&#xD;
making arrangements for leaving the cave. It was&#xD;
a work surrounded with difficulty; but at present we&#xD;
have other and more important threads to weave&#xD;
into the web of this history.&#xD;
Auburn never should have received the title of&#xD;
"City." It is a misnomer. The word city carries&#xD;
with it an idea of great business resource, activity,&#xD;
and influence. Auburn possesses but one of these&#xD;
attributes. There are few cities in the United States,&#xD;
of equal size, which possess greater business. influ-&#xD;
ence; but it is the influence derived from capital.&#xD;
Auburn is rather the lovely garden, equally adorned&#xD;
by nature and art. As a country home for the man&#xD;
of wealth, it is not surpassed in advantages. This&#xD;
allusion to a city, which is never visited by the&#xD;
stranger without similar comment, the reader will&#xD;
doubtless excuse, even though it is not pertinent to&#xD;
our tale.&#xD;
New York has three State institutions for the in-&#xD;
carceration of criminals. One located at Clinton,&#xD;
one at Sing Sing, and one at Auburn. The Auburn&#xD;
State Prison is justly called a model. No expense&#xD;
has been spared by the State government either&#xD;
upon judgment or experiment, to bring it into a&#xD;
state of perfection. Not that all judgment has been"&#xD;
wise, or all experiment successful ; but that the&#xD;

policy of the State government has been guided to&#xD;
meet the wishes of popular sentiment. The people&#xD;
of New York have so often expressed their will in&#xD;
favor of conducting the punishment of criminals upon&#xD;
an enlarged policy, that their public servants have&#xD;
not been deaf to their commands. This needs no&#xD;
better or- more convincing proof than the record&#xD;
afforded by her session laws. But this history has&#xD;
only to do with the Auburn State Prison.&#xD;

"Those vats yonder, aunt, are part of the great&#xD;
Syracuse salt works. It is said that all that is.neces-&#xD;
sary to obtain salt water, for miles around, in Salina&#xD;
and Syracuse, is to bore a hole into the earth some&#xD;
hundred feet, or more or less, and the briny water&#xD;
comes out, clear and sparkling."&#xD;
"That is remarkable. But how far are we from&#xD;
the city of Auburn, James?"&#xD;
"About twenty-five miles. Soon passed."&#xD;
"An hour more of this railroad monotony will use&#xD;
me up for a week," replied Mrs. Tryon; "but' what&#xD;
can't bb cured must be endured."'&#xD;
"'My dearest aunt, you are a philosopher, ipsofac-&#xD;
to, this time."&#xD;
"It's necessary to see facts sometimes; and the&#xD;
'very deed itself' is now crowning me with hyper-&#xD;
fatigue.- That fact I see clearly."&#xD;
"Camillus !" shouted the brakeman.'&#xD;
"A pretty name for a village," added Mrs. Tryon;&#xD;
but, just now, if it were a paradise, I don't want to&#xD;
hear the fact. I should be for stopping the train,&#xD;
considering my mental and physical inquietude."&#xD;
"HlfWay House !" shouted the brakeman.&#xD;
"Why, how we fly! At this rate, we shall see&#xD;

Auburn without expending our strength, after all,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Tryon, looking out of the car window, at a&#xD;
huge pile of wood, which constituted height, length,&#xD;
breadth, and depth of the picture before her. "The&#xD;
monarchs of the forests, James, which once so mag-&#xD;
nificently adorned the view, now meanly obstruct it.&#xD;
'The proud must have a fall.'"&#xD;
It would have been well for this lady had she, at&#xD;
that instant, listened to the "still small voice" which&#xD;
caused her for a moment to wander over the past;&#xD;
but, repressing a rising sigh, she threw off the&#xD;
Heaven-sent monitor, and once more an evil spirit&#xD;
wreathed her face with smiles.&#xD;
"The Junction !" shouted-the brakeman.&#xD;
"The name of this place is a word of good omen,&#xD;
James."&#xD;
"Yes, dearest aunt, I accept it such, but shall,&#xD;
nevertheless, put my shoulder to the wheel before&#xD;
framing a prayer for Jupiter."&#xD;
1" Right," said his aunt, with a complacent smile.&#xD;
" Auburn !" shouted the brakeman.&#xD;
"Good !" responded Mrs. Tryon.     "Give 'the&#xD;
brakeman my thanks ;" and she rose from her seat,&#xD;
as the motion of the car ceased.&#xD;
"Now, dear aunt, for some comfort."&#xD;
In a short time Mrs. Tryon was reclining upon a&#xD;
sofa in her room at the hotel.&#xD;
"Send up a little sherry wine, James; this tire-&#xD;
someness is not natural with me."&#xD;
"With pleasure, dearest aunt," said Mordaunt,&#xD;
glad at something to do to bring back his aunt's&#xD;
spirits; and he left the room.&#xD;
"Here, mother mine, is a cup which will rival the&#xD;
Lachryma  Christi that Byron gave to the ; great&#xD;

O'Doherty, at their chance meeting in Italy. It is&#xD;
not sherry, but it is excellent madeira, or I am no&#xD;
judge.  I see Mr. Mortimer's name is on the re-&#xD;
gister."&#xD;
" What ! is he in Auburn ?" said Mrs. Tryon. "I&#xD;
must arouse from this lethargy. Give me another&#xD;
glass of madeira. There," said she, setting the wine-&#xD;
glass upon the table, "now unlock my trunks, and&#xD;
evacuate the premises, sir."&#xD;
Mordaunt left his aunt to her toilet, and,'retiring&#xD;
to his room, wrote several letters of a business cha-&#xD;
racter. He was thus engaged, when a servant&#xD;
brought word from his aunt that Mr. Mortimer was&#xD;
with hers&#xD;
The greeting between Mordaunt and Mr. Morti-&#xD;
mer was cordial. Mr. Mortimer was already under&#xD;
many obligations to Mordaunt, in matters pertaining&#xD;
to both his private and public business. Mordaunt&#xD;
had improved every opportunity to "act well his&#xD;
part," in all things relevant to the game he had&#xD;
started from cover. In a few days the axe would be&#xD;
laid at the root of the tree. One family would be&#xD;
ruined.&#xD;
"Cupid's dart will have sunk deep, if loss of pro-&#xD;
perty does not tear it from Bell Mortimer's heart,"&#xD;
thought Mordaunt.&#xD;
Coexistent with this thought, Mordaunt smiled his,&#xD;
friendly recognition of Mr. Mortimer's polite atten-&#xD;
tion to Mrs. Tryon.&#xD;
"You cannot visit the prison to-morrow, sir."&#xD;
"(Why not, Mr. Mortimer ?" said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Because, as judge at chambers, I shall sign an&#xD;
order of injunction, pending the decision of which&#xD;
there must necessarily be a stay of proceedings."&#xD;

" Very well, sir. I assure you, frankly, I shall not&#xD;
advise my fair client to risk a process for 'contempt&#xD;
of court,'" replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
" Then I say, very well, sir. We all start for&#xD;
Aurora at nine o'clock and forty-five minutes to-&#xD;
morrow. When Mrs. Tryon is duly recruited, we&#xD;
will make a day of it, and visit the -prison."&#xD;
" Excellent !" said Mrs. Tryon.&#xD;
".And what say you, Mr. Mordaunt ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer.&#xD;
"That there will be no necessity for the order of&#xD;
injunction to issue," replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
Early the following day, while Mordaunt was&#xD;
dressing for his breakfast, a servant brought him&#xD;
word that a man desired to see him.&#xD;
"Show him up, sir," said Mordaunt.&#xD;
The door of his room soon received a second&#xD;
knock.&#xD;
"Come~ in, sir," said Mordaunt, not going to the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"Good mornin' to ye ! I'se early some, but the&#xD;
clerk said you was goin' in the nine forty-five train."&#xD;
"It is true, sir ; but your call is no interruption.&#xD;
Take a seat, and, if you please, let me know yoqr ,t&#xD;
object in calling."&#xD;
" My name, sir, is John Halter.  I've' a leetle&#xD;
lawin' to do in York, and I didn't know but you'd&#xD;
do the business up for' me. To do it, though, you'll&#xD;
hev to let the company go to-day, and stay here till&#xD;
to-morrow."&#xD;
" I am afraid, in that case, Iwould not suityoi&#xD;
sir," replied Mordaunt. " I cannot very well post&#xD;
pone going to-day."&#xD;

across his forehead twice, having the thumb thrust&#xD;
between tyhe .second and third fingers. Mordaunit&#xD;
started for an instant, but immediately laid his right&#xD;
hand, with open palm, upon his left breast. Halter&#xD;
now, with a smile upon his countenance, pronounced&#xD;
the Latin word, "Experimentum."&#xD;
Mordaunt, assuming a friendly smile, answered to&#xD;
this, "Crucis."  Together they mean "a double&#xD;
test."  He then took Halter by the right hand,&#xD;
grasping with his own third and fourth fingers the&#xD;
third and fourth fingers of Halter's hand. Halter&#xD;
responded by grasping Mordaunt's left hand in a-&#xD;
similar way, and pointing, with the index finger of&#xD;
his right hand, towards heaven.&#xD;
"We may converse freely, Mr. Halter,"- said Mor-&#xD;
daunt.&#xD;
"P'raps you'd be kurus to know as how I know'd&#xD;
you fur one ov the 'Ever Faithful,'." said Halter,&#xD;
dropping his voice to a whisper scarcely audible, and&#xD;
gazing cautiously around the room.&#xD;
"No, sir, not at all. The 'Ever Faithful' have&#xD;
ears and hands, but they ask no useless questions.&#xD;
How can an Ever Faithful help his brother? You&#xD;
know probably my only connection with the Society'&#xD;
is as its counsellor and legal adviser in the city of&#xD;
New York."&#xD;
"Yes. Well, my business is about two young men&#xD;
iu New York. They shot two ov our best men about&#xD;
two years ago, and druv me out o' house and home.&#xD;
Bob Shank is one on 'em. He wants to find the&#xD;
'haps. As they's big-bugs, he thought you'd know&#xD;
%."&#xD;
"What are their names ?" said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Thomas Griswold and George Melville."&#xD;
&#xD;
kp7 y1&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
Mordaunt was startled at' this unexpected answer.&#xD;
He instantly determined to hear more, before reveal-&#xD;
ing his acquaintance with-them. Halter detailed all&#xD;
the facts, which the reader already knows. In con-&#xD;
clusion, he said-&#xD;
"9Bob Shank swears them fellers shall pay for the&#xD;
cold comfort they give him and Stringham."&#xD;
"And he is right," said Mordaunt. "Such unne-&#xD;
cessary shooting ought to be avenged."&#xD;
Mordaunt saw here a scheme of revenge which he&#xD;
thought he could foster and guide, without making&#xD;
himself liable in any way, or his hand being seen in it.&#xD;
The gong sounded for breakfast.&#xD;
."I can help your friend in this matter, and will&#xD;
do so. He is in no hurry. Give me a little time,&#xD;
say a month or two, and I will give him a scheme&#xD;
worth his steel."&#xD;
"That's 'nuff sed."&#xD;
"Request Bob Shank to call upon me at New&#xD;
York. Give him this card, and tell him to show it&#xD;
to me when he calls. My address is upon it. I see&#xD;
no necessity for remaining over to-day."&#xD;
" Oh, that's jest a quarter ov my business. Iv'e&#xD;
got a case for you to defend in New York. There's&#xD;
a feller as has been nabbed. He's in the Tombs.&#xD;
He isn't a member ov the order. I've had him in&#xD;
trainin' now three years, and whin he was twenty-&#xD;
one I was goin' to hey him initiated. . Ef I don't see&#xD;
to him, he's got no friends."&#xD;
"He must be attended to, Mr. Halter. I shall&#xD;
remain in Auburn. Such business is always first&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
"Good! your a trump, and no mistake. I'll go&#xD;

Mrs: Tryon went to Aurora in company with Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer. -NMordaunt was .closeted all day with Hal-&#xD;
ter, getting at and arranging the facts necessary to&#xD;
defend a young villain incarcerated in the Tombs at&#xD;
New York, for the criie of arson. It was a difficult&#xD;
case, but Mordaunt was the man for a difficulty.&#xD;
With his connections in a society of scoundrels, sub-&#xD;
ornation of perjury was an easy task.&#xD;
The following day, as Mordaunt stepped upon the&#xD;
platform of a car for the purpose of going to Aurora,.&#xD;
he met Thomas Griswold.&#xD;
The greetings of old friendship passed between&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Another friend of yours is in the train, Mr. Mor-&#xD;
daunt," said Griswold.&#xD;
" AhI1 who is'it ?" asked Mordaunt.&#xD;
"George Melville," said Griswold.&#xD;
"Good! I must shake his hand," remarked Mor-&#xD;
daunt. "I have often recalled the days of Niagara,&#xD;
and our subsequent meetings have been very agree-&#xD;
able, at least on my part."&#xD;
" He is not alone," Mr. Mordaunt!&#xD;
"No'? Who are his companions ?" asked Mor-&#xD;
daunt.:&#xD;
"A sister, and a young lady cousin."&#xD;
"Where are they going ?"&#xD;
"To Aurora. They are not expected $"&#xD;
"What is the cousin's name '" said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"cFlorence Melwood. She resides on the island,&#xD;
Martha's Vineyard. She is thought to be a lovely&#xD;
girl. But where are you bound, Mr. Mordaunt?&#xD;
"To Aurora."&#xD;
&#xD;
Griswold did not reply, good! Clara Edgemonte&#xD;
had shown him Mordaunt's true character, as far as&#xD;
she knew   it.  Mordaunt 'noticed Griswold's ill-&#xD;
dissembled coldness, and immediately set down for&#xD;
the cause that Bell Mortimer had revealed to him&#xD;
that he was a suitor for her hand.&#xD;
"When have you seen Mr. M[ortimer ?" inquired&#xD;
Griswold.&#xD;
"Met him at Auburn, yesterday."&#xD;
"Where did he go ?"&#xD;
" To Aurora. We shall find him there. The&#xD;

The Dinner Party at Aurora-The Telegram--Mrs. Tryon's Glance.&#xD;
"TmE dinner's on the table,'said an old colored&#xD;
woman, named Bess, to Mrs. Mortimer. Bess had&#xD;
been so long a servant in the Mortimer family, and&#xD;
had always directed the' arrangements of the table,&#xD;
that her presence was now considered indispensable&#xD;
to insure success in the arduous duties of the dining-&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the bell we&#xD;
ever have rung in our family.; and, as I have learned&#xD;
by experience to know that Bess's quiet information&#xD;
is really meant as a peremptory order, I shall have&#xD;
to request you to immediate obedience."&#xD;
The dinner party at Mrs. Mortimer's, that day, was&#xD;
a brilliant affair. The persons interested in it were&#xD;
(we give their names as the entrie was accomplished)&#xD;
Mr. Melville and Mrs. Mortimer; Mr. Mortimer and&#xD;
Mrs. Tryon; Mr. Mordaunt and Bell Mortimer;' Mr.'&#xD;
Griswold and Miss Melville:; Mr. Fred Mortimer&#xD;
and Miss Melwood; ten in all.&#xD;
Dinner parties are the same the world over. Mrs.&#xD;

to dufer the opportunity to pass without making an&#xD;

carried captive by her 'brilliant wit, and quickness at&#xD;

repartee, polished by an unexpected store of general&#xD;
information. Bell felt proud of her acquaintance,&#xD;
and, unconsciously yielded to her a higher respect, if&#xD;
esteem would not be the more truthful term, than at&#xD;
any time before. Mordaunt read Bells thoughts,&#xD;
and exerted himself to eclipse even the brilliancy of.&#xD;
his .aunt. In this he could and would have suc-&#xD;
ceeded, but 'for an interruption.&#xD;
" A gentle'um is in the parlor to see Misser Mor-&#xD;
daunt," said Bess.&#xD;
"Excuse me Mrs. Mortimer, if you please," said&#xD;
Mordaunt.&#xD;
"C ertainly, sir. Shall not Bess ask for his&#xD;
name&#xD;
"No,I thank you. I will not trouble her," re-&#xD;
plied Mordaunt.&#xD;
"You wish to see Mr. Mordaunt, sir ?" said Mor-&#xD;
daunt, addressing a young man, apparently about&#xD;
nineteen or twenty years of age.&#xD;
" Yes, sir ! There- is a ' telegraph dispatch re-&#xD;
ceived at Auburn this morning after you left. As it&#xD;
was of an important character, the telegraph operator&#xD;
concluded to send it to Aurora without delay.&#xD;
- "I am very much obliged, sir," replied Mordaunt,&#xD;
breaking open the envelope.&#xD;
He read the following:&#xD;
"tNo. - WALL STREET, N. Y., 18---.&#xD;
"To JAMES MORDAUNT, ESQ.&#xD;
"Lose no time in closing with the company. Be in New York the&#xD;
15th without fail, and bring the bonds.&#xD;

the amount of $300,000 were already in Mordaunt's&#xD;
possession.&#xD;
"What time does the afternoon train for New York&#xD;
pass through Auburn ?" asked Mordaunt of the tele-&#xD;
graph messenger.&#xD;
" Four o'clock andfiffty minutes," was the reply.&#xD;
"Is your horse fast ?" said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"«Yes sir," was the reply.&#xD;
" Can I ride with you to Auburn?" asked Mor-&#xD;
daunt.&#xD;
"With pleasure, sir. I can bring you in time for&#xD;
the train, if we start immediately," said the messen-&#xD;
ger, looking at his watch.&#xD;
Mordaunt ran to his room, hastily packed his valise,&#xD;
and catching up his overcoat, returned to the parlor.&#xD;
"Put those in the buggy, and I will be with you&#xD;
in a moment," said he to the messenger.&#xD;
Going next to the dining-room, he requested his&#xD;
aunt's presence in the parlor.&#xD;
"K[ must go immediately to New York, Aunt&#xD;
Sarah.  This dispatch will explain why. Burn it&#xD;
after you have read it. You need no instructions.&#xD;
Good bye. Expect me on Saturday or Monday."&#xD;
Saying this he departed.&#xD;
"Does your nephew not return to finish his din-&#xD;
ner, Mrs. Tryon ?" said Mrs. Mortimer.&#xD;
"No. He has already left for Auburn, en route&#xD;
for New York. His presence is demanded there on&#xD;
the 15th. He will' return to Aurora Saturday or&#xD;
Monday.&#xD;
"A sudden departure, truly," said Mr. Mortirner.&#xD;
"Very sudden," said Mrs. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Sudden and cool," said Griswold. "Business&#xD;
might take a ride over Niagara Falls before -&#xD;
&#xD;
would fee a railroad company at the expense of a&#xD;
dinner."&#xD;
Mrs. Tryon cast a quick glance at Griswold to dis-&#xD;
cover if there was any double meaning in this chance&#xD;
remark. Griswold noticed the glance.; but it made&#xD;
no lasting impression upon him. He afterwards&#xD;
learned how to explain it.&#xD;

GEORGE MELVILLE.    li&#xD;

Broadway, New York-James Mordaunt, Esq., at his Office in Wall&#xD;
street-Is he a Married Man?&#xD;
IT was a warm day in July. Broadway, the street&#xD;
of New York city, was filled with a swarm of the&#xD;
wild and sober minded, anxious and sedate, wealthy&#xD;
and poor, lovely and plain, fashionable and home-&#xD;
spun, happy and miserable, all classes, climes, and&#xD;
nations being duly represented. Integrity and vil-&#xD;
lainy, virtue and vice, momentarily jostled in unknown&#xD;
contact. At half-past nine, James Mordaunt pulled&#xD;
the check-string of a Fifth Avenue omnibus, and&#xD;
alighted from  it opposite .Barclay street, mear the&#xD;
Astor House. Entering that hotel, he left some let-&#xD;
ters with the book-keeper, and immediately joined&#xD;
the throng of business men hurrying to discharge&#xD;
their various occupations. When opposite. John&#xD;
street, he was accosted by a man, who- evidently&#xD;
knew him; but whose face did not seem familiar.&#xD;
"Mr. Mordaunt,. I believe."&#xD;
"es, sir, that is my name.".&#xD;
"I've a little matter of bis'ness with you; and if&#xD;
you've no objections, I'll go with you to your office."&#xD;
'My address is No.-- Wall street. You can call&#xD;
at 11 o'clock. I shall then. be disengaged. for a short&#xD;
ti:e,'  replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, that will do."&#xD;
At the appointed hour, Mordaunt was greeted. in&#xD;
his office by the stranger.&#xD;
Taking him into his private room, he asked his&#xD;
business.&#xD;
"I've concluded,-Mr. Mordaunt, that Mary Sanders&#xD;
has got to have her rights."&#xD;
"Who are you, sir?" said Mordaunt, quickly, his&#xD;
face betraying sudden anxiety, becoming flush' and&#xD;
pale by turns.&#xD;
"It's of little consequence who I am. All that is&#xD;
necessary for you to do is to settle twenty thousand&#xD;
dollars on Mary Mordaunt, alias Mary Sanders, avow&#xD;
your marriage with her, acknowledge the legitimacy&#xD;
of your daughter Mary, and you won't be troubled&#xD;
any more byrme."&#xD;
"Mary Sanders! avow marriage ! settle twenty&#xD;
thousand dollars ! acknowledge legitimacy !"  said&#xD;
Mordaunt, dwelling upon each word, and speaking&#xD;
in the utmost surprise.&#xD;
"You can dissemble splendidly, sir ; but I have no&#xD;
time to waste, as my ship sails on a whaling voyage,&#xD;
next week," replied his visitor.&#xD;
"You lie under some strange delusion, sir," replied&#xD;
Mordaunt, evidently very much agitated.&#xD;
"Well, if I must I must, that is all. So I will bid&#xD;
you good morning, and call upon some more honest&#xD;
counsellor for the necessary redress. Take notice,&#xD;
young man, justforty-five thousand dollars of as hard&#xD;
earned money as any master ever lanced out of sperm&#xD;
whales, in five voyages, will pay lawyers' fees to give&#xD;
Mary her rights. It isnow four years since Molly&#xD;
bid her hard-fisted uncle good bye. She was then a&#xD;
pretty girl, and  jut like bei another. That'smy his=&#xD;

ter. You've played the game very nice with the girl;&#xD;
but now you've got her uncle, Joseph Horton, to set-&#xD;
tle with. For your present comfort in the mutter, I&#xD;
will add, Rev. John Furnace, who lives at No.-.&#xD;
Washington street, in the city of Brooklyn, is now&#xD;
ready to swear to the identity between James Mor-&#xD;
daunt and a young sailor named Jack Sanders.. Good&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
"Good morning, sir," said Nordaunt, with a cool-&#xD;
ness and suavity which surprised honest Capt.&#xD;
Joseph Horton. -He had supposed his threats would&#xD;
frighten Mordaunt ; but he had yet to learn the&#xD;
character he was dealing with.&#xD;
About one year before James Mordaunt graduated&#xD;
from college he made the acquaintance of Mary Wil-&#xD;
cox. She lived with her mother in a small tenement&#xD;
in Brooklyn, N.Y. They derived support from their&#xD;
needle, and the liberality of Joseph Horton, an old&#xD;
bachelor, Mrs. Wilcox having lost her husband.&#xD;
Mordaunt first met Miss Wilcox at a small masque-&#xD;
rade party. He was attracted by her beauty, and&#xD;
deliberately planned her ruin. In all the visits he&#xD;
made the poor girl, he went disguised in the charac-&#xD;
ter of-a common sailor. In the course of a few&#xD;
months he won Mary's deepest and holiest affection.&#xD;
Th e mother strenuously opposed Mary's marrying&#xD;
until, her uncle, Captain Horton, should return; he&#xD;
being then upon a whaling voyage. Mordaunt&#xD;
finally persuaded the artless girl to marry him pri-&#xD;
vately. The marriage was duly performed by Rev.&#xD;
John Furnace. Mary Wilcox, by this means, became&#xD;
Mary Sanders, alias Mary Mordaunt. Of course,&#xD;
Mary's ruin was an easy task. In a few months she&#xD;
became the deserted wife and young mother. Mor-&#xD;
&#xD;
daunt bad conducted the marriage so skillfully that&#xD;
Mary had no trace by which to discover the clergy-&#xD;
man's residence. The ceremony had been performed&#xD;
at a small house of ill-repute in New York, hired by&#xD;
Mordaunt for the purpose. Mordaunt had supposed&#xD;
the man who performed the ceremony was not a&#xD;
clergyman. In this he was mistaken, if, indeed, the&#xD;
laws of New York State required one to make a mar-&#xD;
riage valid. He had been duly married, and by one&#xD;
person his villainy was known, and a note made of it.&#xD;
Two months after the birth of her child, Mary&#xD;
Sanders, for such we 'shall call her at present, was&#xD;
walking up Broadway, when, in front of the City&#xD;
Hospital, she met James Mordaunt, and in the fash-&#xD;
ionable young mein recognized her husband. Mor-&#xD;
daunt also recognized her, but coolly walked on.&#xD;
She ran towards him and caught is arm. He&#xD;
hastily and roughly shook her off, and mingled in-&#xD;
stantly with the crowd. Mary, in terrible anguish,&#xD;
the fot blood coursing through her veins with light-&#xD;
ning speed, felt her head whirling and her eyes&#xD;
growing dim. She struggled bravely against this&#xD;
torrent of bitter woe, but not successfully. She sank&#xD;
upon the walk unconscious, for the moment, of her&#xD;
existence. Kind Heaven relieved her soul of all its&#xD;
sorrows, to prepare it anew to cope with trial. One&#xD;
eye had seen Mary's grasp upon Mordaunt's arm.&#xD;
"Jacob, stop the carriage ! I wish that young&#xD;
woman to ride home with me."&#xD;
Jacob obeyed the request of Clara Edgemonte.&#xD;
With some difficulty he penetrated the crowd which&#xD;
had instantly surrounded the fallen woman. Obtain-&#xD;
ing the assistance .of some bystanders, using threats&#xD;
and entreaties, he succeeded in placing her in the&#xD;

carriage. Clara then ordered Jacqb to drive away&#xD;
from the crowd. When opposite a drug store, she&#xD;
had some restoratives brought, and Mary soon he-&#xD;
came conscious.&#xD;
Jacob now drove rapidly home. Clara used her&#xD;
kindest efforts to sympathize with the deeply-afflicted&#xD;
girl; for Mary, although a mother, was yet only&#xD;
nineteen years of age. By earnest entreaty, Clara&#xD;
succeeded in winning Mary's confidence. She told&#xD;
her story, and, in return, learned from  Clara the&#xD;
name of her destroyer. Clara, at this time, knew&#xD;
Mordaunt only by sight and 'repute. Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Edgemonte were in Europe. Clara was alone, and&#xD;
obliged to act for herself in the matter. She ordered&#xD;
Jacob to, go to Mary's residence and inform her&#xD;
mother where she was, and that she would not return&#xD;
until the following day. She also commissioned him&#xD;
to ask J. S. Taylor, Esq., a lawyer with whom she&#xD;
knew her father had business connection, to ride up&#xD;
with him immediately. Clara knew nothing, ofwait-&#xD;
ing. To will was to do with her. At a late hour in&#xD;
the afternoon, Mr. Taylor called.  After hearing&#xD;
Mary's story, he told her the case was almost hope-&#xD;
less. She might bring an action against Mordaunt&#xD;
on her own testimony, but it could not be main-&#xD;
tained without further proof. He advised her to&#xD;
wait and watch. He took a note of the case, her&#xD;
address, etc., and gave her his promise that he would&#xD;
use every exertion to discover the requisite proof.&#xD;
He sought the students of the college, questioned&#xD;
them, endeavored to trace Mordaunt on the night of&#xD;
thy marriage, etc., etc., but°all to no purpose.. The&#xD;
plane of Mordaunt had been so skillfully woven that&#xD;
they denied unravelling. He finally gave np the&#xD;
&#xD;
pursuit, and advised Mary to bide her time. In this&#xD;
condition, the matter had remained up to the hour&#xD;
when James. Mordaunt so suddenly left Aurora, on&#xD;
the receipt of Messrs. Power &amp;amp; Loftus' telegraph&#xD;
dispatch.&#xD;

Mordaunt, in soliloquy, stepping lightly across the&#xD;
office, and taking his hat. Going into the main&#xD;
office, he said to a clerk-&#xD;
" Mr. Loftus will be here at twelve o'clock. Give&#xD;
him this bundle, and tell him I shall call at four&#xD;
o'clock precisely."&#xD;
"Yes sir," replied the clerk.&#xD;
Mordant went immediately to his aunt's resi-&#xD;
dence He there assumed a disguise, and proceeded&#xD;
to Brooklyn.: He called upon Rev. Mr. Furnace,&#xD;
and carefully noticed everything about the house and&#xD;
premises. His business, he said, was to obtain his&#xD;
services at a funeral, in case he should be disap-&#xD;
pointed by another clergyman.. Mr. Furnace readily&#xD;
agreed to the arrangement.   The funeral he in-&#xD;
formed Mr. Furnace, would be held the next day at&#xD;
five o'clock, r.m  The burial would take place in"'&#xD;
Greenwood Cemetery.&#xD;
"Xow," said Mordaunt to himself, as he walked&#xD;
down Fulton street to Fulton Ferry, we "will see&#xD;
about getting a party of the 'Ever Faithful' 'to&#xD;
attend this funeral. If there is not a coroner's in-&#xD;
quest on the body of Rev. John Furnace, it will be&#xD;
because the said body does not show itself."&#xD;
At twelve o'clock noon the next day, Mr. Taylor&#xD;
gave the papers requisite for commencing legal pro-&#xD;
ceedings to his clerk, .to obtain "admission of ser-&#xD;
vice," at the suit of Mary Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Take thesepapers, and serve Mr. Mordaunt with&#xD;
a copy of them to-morrow morning," said Mr. Taylor.&#xD;
" Yes air"&#xD;
rAt eleven blockp on the following d aM it&#xD;
received the papers, and gave "due adinissio i. ao&#xD;

The clerk, after he had obtained the admissions, left&#xD;

"Well, Mr. Shank, it stms there was a funeral&#xD;
yesterday afternoon at Brooklyn. I see by the pa-&#xD;
pers that the clergyman who officiated .at that fune-&#xD;
ral did not return to his home. 'Fears,' say the&#xD;
papers, Care entertained, that after the procession&#xD;
returned to the city, Mr. Furnace, who, preferring to&#xD;
walk home, had dismissed his carriage, was foully&#xD;
dealt with by parties unknown. As yet, no clue has&#xD;
been discovered by which to unravel the mys-&#xD;
tery'"&#xD;
" That seems to be quite satisfactory, Mr.. Shank,"&#xD;
continued Mordaunt ; "and now, as one good turn&#xD;
deserves another, I will give you my  advice about,&#xD;
one of the young men whom Mr. Halter mentioned&#xD;
to me. The Griswold you speak of resides at No. --&#xD;
Fourteenth street, New York. My advice to you is,&#xD;
make a night visit to the house; effect an entrance;&#xD;
gather what seems worth carrying away, and set fire&#xD;
to the remainder."&#xD;
Good I" said the villain, known as Bob Shank ;&#xD;
"that will fix one of theau  You don't know the&#xD;
other?"&#xD;
"No," replied Mordaunt, "not as yet. I will let&#xD;
you know what I discover, however. Call on me&#xD;
Friday, as I leave the city Saturday, or Monday, at&#xD;
the farthest."&#xD;
" Mr. Loftus," said a clerk, opening the office&#xD;
&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
Show him in, sir, if you please," said Mordaunt,&#xD;
tthesame time bidding "Shank" good morning.&#xD;
Good morning,IMfr. Loftus," said Mordauntaris-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing and greeting one of the firm of "Power &amp;amp;&#xD;
Loftus," brokers, with his most winning smile.&#xD;
"You are prompt."&#xD;
"A very easy task, Mr. Mordaunt. With you for&#xD;
a general, most any stock might go at a high figure.&#xD;
We have disposed of seventy-five thousan. at 110 for&#xD;
first-class paper at thirty days.  That nets you&#xD;
$7,500. But that is not the best of it. James H.&#xD;
Griswold has finally offered 109 for $200,000. Wright&#xD;
&amp;amp; Pierce, by his order, sent an agent to examine the&#xD;
affairs of the "Catfish Company."  He has returned,&#xD;
tnd reported it' as a splendid investment. Shall I&#xD;
close with 1091? The balance of the stock Power &amp;amp;&#xD;
Loftus will take from you at par, for cash, in place&#xD;
of charging you commissions."&#xD;
"Very well," said Mordaunt.  "You may close&#xD;
the bargain ;" and Loftus retired.&#xD;
Two hours afterwards, he again entered Mordaunt's&#xD;
office.&#xD;
"There, Mr. Mordaunt," said Loftus, "are eight&#xD;
notes at thirty days for ten thousand dollars each,&#xD;
and one for $2,500. Total, $82,500 ; and there are&#xD;
seven checks, amounting in the aggregate to $219;500.&#xD;
There, sir, is ' Power &amp;amp; Loftus's' check; for $5000.&#xD;
Grand total, $327,000.' Griswold took our $25,000 at&#xD;
112."&#xD;
"Very well, Mr. Loftus; I shall have more work&#xD;
for you soon," replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
"We shall be very happy to attend to your orders,&#xD;
air. Good afternoon."&#xD;
Mordaunt was now alone. He looked upon the&#xD;
evidences of capital which lay before him; but, not&#xD;

into market immediately, of course he would realize&#xD;
nearly, or quite the amount of his outlay.&#xD;
"-Give me one week the start, and if a dollar of the&#xD;
Catfish Railroad Company's stock or securities sells&#xD;
iiNew York,:I will buy it at par," said M[ordaunt,&#xD;
rising and opening the door which led to his princi-&#xD;
pal office. "Mr. Johnston," said he to a clerk, " go&#xD;
and ask Mr. Hoskins to call up here."&#xD;
" Yes, sir."&#xD;
In ten minutes Mr. Hoskins entered Mordaunt's&#xD;
office. The secret grips which passed between&#xD;
John Halter and Mordaunt in Auburn, now passed&#xD;
between Hoskins and Mordaunt.&#xD;
".Mr. Hoskins, have you heard of the Catfish&#xD;
Railroad Company-?" said Mordaunt&#xD;
Yes, sir; some of your planning, I believe."&#xD;
"Yes," said Mordaunt. "Well, I want the stock&#xD;
of that company to find 'buyers scarce."'&#xD;
"I comprehend. You want to buy low," said&#xD;
Hoskins.&#xD;
" Just. so.," said Mordaunt. "Can you do it ?."&#xD;
"How soon ?"&#xD;
"One week at the extent."&#xD;
"That's quick work," said Hoskins.&#xD;
"Not for a man of your genius," replied Mor-&#xD;
daunt. "My check for one thousand dollars is ready&#xD;
for you, if at the end of a week that stock is below&#xD;
fifty. It stands to-day at one hundred and ten at&#xD;
private sales."&#xD;
"The offer is very fair, and without the money&#xD;
you should have my services; but it will cost more&#xD;
than that sum. I shall be obliged to employ consi-&#xD;
derable help "&#xD;

GcEoI 'E MELVILLE.&#xD;

Say no more," interrupted Mordaunt. "Name&#xD;
the amount at once."&#xD;
"Three thousand may do. If I want more, I will&#xD;
call and see you."&#xD;
"Send a telegram to me at Aurora, if you need&#xD;
more. I leave for that place to-night," said Mor-&#xD;
daunt.&#xD;
It was nearly five o'clock. His work wa finished.&#xD;
As he handed Mr. Hoskins his check for three thou-&#xD;
sand dollars he said to himself, "That money is well&#xD;
invested if it brings me Bell Mortiner for a wife,&#xD;
even in a pecuniary point of view."&#xD;
In an hour more he was on route for Aurora.&#xD;

Heroism-The Catfish Railroad Stock falling-Trouble.&#xD;
IT was five o'clock, r.M., as the loud booming&#xD;
signal gun reverberated over the lew York Bay,&#xD;
announcing the arrival of an "ocean steamer."  In a&#xD;
short time the magnificent craft would moor at her&#xD;
pier, and send forth from her bosom the sons and&#xD;
daughters of every nation, to tread the soil of free-&#xD;
dom; to mingle with the sons' and daughters of the-&#xD;
Republic; to bask in the sunshine of liberty. And&#xD;
the noble vessel, too, has united loving hearts. See,&#xD;
careful observer, is not that meeting, friend with&#xD;
friend, a foretaste of the joys to be felt in a more&#xD;
enduring world?    Canst thou pen the unwritten&#xD;
poetry which sounds from among that happy group,&#xD;
in sweetest numbers&#xD;
"With a full but soft emotion,&#xD;
Like the swell of summer's ocean ?"&#xD;
ry it. 'Twill do thy heart a service, and prepare&#xD;
hee better to appreciate that meeting on 'the deck.&#xD;

happy pair were pledged to love. The bright affee-&#xD;

upon the rich beds in love's beautiful garden, bear-&#xD;
ing with healthy growth those rarest plants gathered&#xD;
from every clime, confidence, self-sacrifice, heroism,&#xD;
virtue; and giving forth as a rich and swift-pervad-&#xD;
ing perfume, the faith which fathers holy thought.,&#xD;
" Your pass, if you please, sir," said a man at the&#xD;
gangway to Thopnas Griswold, as he went on board&#xD;
the Liverpool steamer.  "All right I"  In  a few&#xD;
moments Griswold and Clara Edgemonte had met&#xD;
after a separation of nearly one year.&#xD;

their happiness pass by.&#xD;

"Where, dear Clara, are your father and mother?"&#xD;
" The mother is not far off," said Mrs. Edgemonte,&#xD;
entering the richly-furnished, so to -speak, drawing-&#xD;
room of the steamer.  "I have been looking' for&#xD;
you, Mr. Griswold, but gave up the chase, and deter-&#xD;
mined to be very dignified and let you find me."&#xD;
"Here comes father," said Clara.&#xD;
Griswold turned and met Mr. Edgemonte half&#xD;
way.&#xD;
" All well in America, Thomas? You see wife&#xD;
and Clara show frr themselves ; a voyage does them&#xD;
good," said Mr. Edgemonte, cordially shaking hands&#xD;
with Griswold.&#xD;
The meeting between' Clara and Griswold wasa&#xD;
happy one. His visit at Mr. Edgemonte's residence&#xD;
that evening, was prolonged into the hours ofnight.&#xD;

Niagara, and will return to Aurora next Thursday.&#xD;
There goes the City-Hall bell! Somebody's property&#xD;
is in danger, and perhaps life. Fires are so common&#xD;
in this great pity that we forget to sympathize with&#xD;
those who are called upon to face the destroying&#xD;
"True ! This time, Thomas, the fire seems near&#xD;
by," said Clara.&#xD;
Just. then the flames, heretofore pent up by the&#xD;
walls and metal roof, burst their barriers, and spread&#xD;
over the night the twilight of a brilliant sunset.&#xD;
That fire cannot be very distant," said Griswold.&#xD;
"Clara, I will go and see where it is. Good night!&#xD;
Expect me at ten o'clock to-morrow.&#xD;
Griswold hurried up Fifth Avenue to Fourteenth&#xD;
street, that being the direction of the fire. As he&#xD;
turned the corner, he saw that it was his own home&#xD;
which the tortuous, serpent-tongued flames were rap-&#xD;
idly licking, with unrelenting satisfaction. He saw&#xD;
too, that all which human effort could accomplish,&#xD;
would be the preservation of contiguous and sur-&#xD;
rounding. buildings. Griswold's thoughts, and our&#xD;
pen recording them, acknowledge a wide difference&#xD;
in their motive power. His energies were instantly&#xD;
aroused. To find that-his father was safe, was his&#xD;
first' object. He was soon gratified in this respect.&#xD;
lie then thought only of the safety of families living&#xD;
adjacent, and the preservation of their property. To&#xD;
this:work he energetically devoted himself. No one,&#xD;
under such an excitement, can tell what good an&#xD;
energeticiul may accomplish until he has essayed&#xD;

&#xD;
nance of their orders, he sent parties of men to&#xD;
every room in the adjoining buildings,leading on the&#xD;
bold and daring and pressing the idle into the ser-&#xD;
vice. He also cautioned one and all whom he met,&#xD;
to be cool and steady. "Broken furniture is as well&#xD;
burnt," was his motto, wherever he discovered the&#xD;
least carelessness. He aroused, too, the fast accumu-&#xD;
lating force of policemen, to a more active sense of&#xD;
their duty. It was not half an hour before every&#xD;
fireman, and policeman on the ground, had seen and&#xD;
approved some act of Griswold's, and become infused&#xD;
with his determined energy. Nor did he leave the&#xD;
work half finished.  When the imminent danger:&#xD;
which had threatened the surrounding property was&#xD;
past, he turned his attention to the firemen, who,&#xD;
without hopes or expectancy of reward, at the risk&#xD;
of life and limb, had bravely and so successfully,&#xD;
fought their fearful enemy. Going from house to&#xD;
house, he aroused the inmates to prepare and send&#xD;
them refreshments, an attention too often forgotten&#xD;
in times of similar peril.&#xD;
Mr. Griswold, the third day subsequent to the fire,&#xD;
entered the office of' "Messrs. Wright &amp;amp; Pierce,&#xD;
Brokers."&#xD;
"What success, Mr. Wright, with the 'Catfish&#xD;
Railroad Stock?"' said Mr. Griswold.&#xD;
" None at all!"  Some unaccountable cause has&#xD;
made, everybody afraid to touch it.  We have not&#xD;
sold a single share. The friends of nearly every rail-&#xD;
road security in market have become opposed to the&#xD;
Catfish.Raiioad management, in advance, of any&#xD;
public sales of its stock."&#xD;
Mr. t*iswold, although surprised at this' report,&#xD;
betrayed no uneasiness. H'lie. bought the stock fora&#xD;

'  pr n  investment originally.  He knew its&#xD;
u     uld fluctuate. He knew also, that if he&#xD;
gidd succeed' in carrying it through, eventually he,&#xD;
would realize handsomely. The stock was paid for.&#xD;
He had sufficient to ineet all his current expenses,&#xD;
but for theloss of his house. To build as he desired,&#xD;
vas now out of the question, unless he could realize&#xD;
on the Catfish Railroad stock.&#xD;
se had lost his house and furniture, upon which&#xD;
there was no insurance. The cause of the fire lie&#xD;
had not been able to ascertain, but believed it to be&#xD;
the work of an incendiary, as nearly all the valuable&#xD;
silver in his house was gone, while some trifling&#xD;
articles 2i1y were saved. He still had thirty thon-&#xD;
sand dollars, which he had intended for his son on his&#xD;
wedding-day. But lie hoped to realize upon his stock.&#xD;
Day after day passed. The reports from his agents&#xD;
were unfavorable. The day for his son's wedding&#xD;
gradually approached..  Unless he could sell hie&#xD;
stock, the wedding, he determined, should not go on.&#xD;
Thomas was already admitted to his profession; but,&#xD;
ets he had no income from its practice. Early&#xD;
one evening, while he was forming a plan to meet&#xD;
the difficulty, a little billet was placed in his hands.&#xD;
It proved to be a notice of protest on a bank note for&#xD;
a large sum, upon which his name was written as&#xD;
first indorser.&#xD;
'Well! Misfortunes never come single," said Mr.&#xD;
Giswold, calmly, and like a man who has learned&#xD;
to look upon the world merely as a place for prepa-&#xD;
rafion to enter a better. Two days after, a fire oc&#xD;
cured among the shipping on the East River, and a&#xD;
arese neaby Mr.4dswold wag totaly destroyed.&#xD;
Theihsirnce cotay Igoved insolvent.  the quas.&#xD;
&#xD;
I;&#xD;
&#xD;
tion with Mr. Griswold was, no longer, shall the&#xD;
marriage be postponed?       It now  became, "shall I&#xD;
make an assignment for the benefit of my creditors ?"&#xD;
By this time the Catfish Railroad Company had&#xD;
expended their resources, and the directors, who had&#xD;
made extensions beyond their capital, called a meet-&#xD;
ing of   the stockholders to consult upon the best&#xD;
method to be pursued.. It was determined to sell the&#xD;
road to some new company for the amount of the old&#xD;
company's debt. This of course made every dollar&#xD;
of the original stock and securities worthless.&#xD;
An action at law was brought against Mr. Grisn,&#xD;
wold, by the bank holding his name as an indorser.&#xD;
Before an issue could be had, however, Mr. Griswold&#xD;
made, an assignment. On the same day, Thomas&#xD;
Griswold wrote the following note and sent it to Mr.&#xD;
Edgemonte by a servant.&#xD;
NEW YOE, -, 18--.&#xD;
MY DEAR AND RESPECTED SI:o&#xD;
You will learn, by the usual channel, that to-day, my father has&#xD;
been called upon to make an assignment of his property to satisfy his&#xD;
creditors. This event makes it incumbent upon me to assign to you&#xD;
the hold I have gained upon your friendship. I rejoice this sad event&#xD;
has happened in advance of my anticipated union with Clara. While&#xD;
my heart remains the same, my judgment leads to this missive.&#xD;
Yours, respectfuly,&#xD;

"CLARA, come into my study, if you please," said&#xD;
Mr. Edgemonte to his daughter, the morning after he&#xD;
received Thomas Griswold's note.&#xD;
"Yies, dear father," said Clara, running in advance&#xD;
of his slower pace, and opening the door for him.&#xD;
" When have you seen Mary Sanders ?"&#xD;
"She called to see me three days after we returned&#xD;
from Europe."&#xD;
t"iTid she give you any good news for herself?"&#xD;
"es, sir. Mr. Taylor had found testimony enough&#xD;
to go to law with."&#xD;
The" reader will recollect that when Clara first&#xD;
Made the acquaintance of Mary Sanders, her pa-&#xD;
rents were in Europe. As soon, as they returned to&#xD;
the United States, Clara informed her mother of the&#xD;
cidmstances connected with Mary.     Mr. Edge-&#xD;
monte was not informed of it until Mordaunt and his-&#xD;
daughter had become acquaintances. He then inves-&#xD;
tigated the story, aid came to the conclusion that&#xD;
Mary might be mistaken. At any rate, he advised&#xD;
Clara to base no action upon the story except so far&#xD;
as regarded her own associations with Mordaunt.&#xD;
'That will do, dear Clara, and now here is your&#xD;
first realtrial in life. You must bear it like an Edge-&#xD;

Thomas's father. Mr. Griswold has been obliged to&#xD;

note to me. There ; you may read it."&#xD;
When she had finished the reading, looking up&#xD;
with a smile, she said:&#xD;
" Is that all, dear father? You have enough for&#xD;
both."&#xD;
"No, Clara, not all. Thomas is too proud to ac-&#xD;
cept Clara Edgemonte's hand for the purpose of liv-&#xD;
ing upon her bounty."&#xD;
Clara turned her gaze from her father's face, and a&#xD;
thoughtful, and gradually-growing sorrowful expres-&#xD;
sion spread over her face.&#xD;
"I have already made the offer to Mr. Griswold to&#xD;
assist him out of his difficulties. The principal cause&#xD;
of his ruin is the New.York Catfish Railroad Com-&#xD;
pany. All the old stockholders have been allowed to&#xD;
come in for double stock, by paying fifty for one hun-&#xD;
dred of stock. I shall secure Mr. Griswold's venture&#xD;
by taking $100,000 of the new stock. This he con-&#xD;
sents to my doing. Eventually it will put him ,on&#xD;
his feet. I am not so fortunate with Thomas. He&#xD;
says you must settle the question, ' will you wait his&#xD;
wish?' What says my Clara?"&#xD;
" Yes, ten years, and will go write him to that&#xD;
effect now."&#xD;
"Go, Clara, go. - I am proud of you."&#xD;

"Yes; .I hear the teeth rattle. You would do the&#xD;
old song, 'Shivery, shivery, ho, ho ho ! the man that&#xD;
couldn't get warm,' to perfection."&#xD;
Breakfast over, Melville, valise in hand, might&#xD;
have been seen walking rapidly towards Clinton vil-&#xD;
lage. H3e obtains a horse and cutter. Crack goes&#xD;
the whip. "Tam, write to  me from New York.&#xD;
Good-bye." In. an hour's time, Melville was at the&#xD;
Utica depot, waiting for the eastern train going West.&#xD;
The time for its arrival had already passed.&#xD;
"Two hours behind time, as I'm alive I" said Mel-&#xD;
ville, looking at his watch.&#xD;
"Yes, sir ; and it will be two more before the train&#xD;
comes. . It is snowed in between here and Schenec-&#xD;
tady," said a railroad official, with whom Melville&#xD;
was on intimate terms.&#xD;
At three o'clock, r.u., the train came along. Two&#xD;
locomotives were attached to it, draggingbut three&#xD;
cars. The locomotives were covered with icicles, and&#xD;
hard packed snow, an ocular proof of the struggle&#xD;
they had gone through with against time. Time, with&#xD;
his cohorts of ice; snow and frost, had beaten- the&#xD;
iron horses by four hours, in the race from Schenec-&#xD;
tady to Utica.&#xD;
"At last I am aboard," said Melville, getting as&#xD;
close to the car stove as his fellow-passengers would&#xD;
allow. At every five or ten miles, sometimes more&#xD;
frequently, the train was obliged to halt, and all&#xD;
hands turn to and fight the mountain snow drifts with&#xD;
shovel and scoop.  Many of the passengers vol n-&#xD;
tarily assisted in the labor, lthough always against&#xD;
the vihes of the railroad officials.&#xD;

breath, stretching out his almost frozen limbs, and&#xD;
throwing his hands back and forth rapidly against&#xD;
his  shoulders.&#xD;
"Shall I take your horse, sir ?" said. a boy.&#xD;
"Yes, put him out ; have him well rubbed down&#xD;
immediately. Put on his blanket, and let him stand&#xD;
without eating," responded Melvill6.&#xD;
In a few moments he was warming himself by the&#xD;
genial fire of mine host of the Aurora House.&#xD;
"What time do you have tea, sir ?" inquired Mel-&#xD;
ville.&#xD;
" In about an hour."&#xD;
"Very well, sir. Put down a plate for me, and&#xD;
give me a room, with a good fire." Then, taking his&#xD;
hat, he went to the barn to see his horse.&#xD;
"Boy ! how goes the horse ?"&#xD;
"rine, shure, yer honor."&#xD;
"Have#you rubbed him down ?"&#xD;
"Be jabers ! an' Ihev',.sir."&#xD;
"Well, then, here is a quarter for you."&#xD;

"No;. he will do now. Do you know Mr. Frede-&#xD;
ick IMortimer ?"&#xD;
Yis; an' he's the finest gentleman in 'Rory, barren'&#xD;
his father and Misthress Bell."&#xD;
Taking a card from his pocket, Melville handed it&#xD;
to the boy, with a smile at his ideas of a fine gentle-&#xD;
man in he person of the lovely Bell Mortimer.&#xD;
"Take that card and give it to him. Say the gen-&#xD;
tleman who sent it is at the Aurora Hoteh"&#xD;
"Yis,.sirs"&#xD;
Jst as the supper bell was sounded, Frederick&#xD;
i4rier entered the hotel-.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Good ! I waited at Auburn yesterday for you&#xD;
over five hours," said Fred. "Business called me&#xD;
home, or I should have remained until to day. Bell&#xD;
is not at home. She is at her aunt's, about six miles&#xD;
south from here. We will try and catch her at&#xD;
Aunt luldah's, taking breakfast. To do it, you must&#xD;
rise at just a quarter to six. They breakfast at seven.&#xD;
Aunt Huldah is a well-regulated clock. You can&#xD;
always tell the time of day by her daily meals."&#xD;
"Does Bell know anything about my visit," said&#xD;
Melville.&#xD;
"Oh, yes ! but she is a queer specimen of woman-&#xD;
kind; does just as she chooses. When I told her&#xD;
that you had deigned to accept my invitation and&#xD;
spend the holidays with me, she gave a regular&#xD;
round of applause ; clapped her hands magnificently,&#xD;
and made believe give me a kiss.- I wouldn't put up&#xD;
with that as a finale, and so placed my arm in posi-&#xD;
tion and stole the reality.  'There,' said she, '"Mr.&#xD;
Impudence ! for that error of poor human nature I&#xD;
shall go and make Aunt Huldah a visit, and spend a&#xD;
week. You have issued orders without a council of&#xD;
war, and now, please, attend to the wants of the new&#xD;
recruit yourself.' True to her word, she had her&#xD;
little pony put before her cutter, and left an hour&#xD;
before I awoke yesterday morning."&#xD;
"Capital!" said Melville. "Let us have the morn-&#xD;
ing ride by all means. We will make her a call, lut&#xD;
positively set our faces against her coming to Aurdia&#xD;
to interfere with our bachelor living."&#xD;
"We must not allow her to'*mourn for our absence,&#xD;

to get along well without her. Now for our quar-&#xD;

Tis, sir; thank ye,"said the boy, as he caught the&#xD;
quarter Fred tossed him.&#xD;
At six .;clock the following morning the two&#xD;
young gentlemen were ready for their ride.&#xD;
"Melville," said Fred, "I have made a change in&#xD;
the programme."&#xD;
"Tery well; what is it? I shall not object," re-&#xD;
plied Melville.&#xD;
"The ice on the lake is smooth as a mirror, and&#xD;
perfectly safe; the weather looks steady; the wind&#xD;
blows just right for a sail either north or south. With&#xD;
the breeze we have this morning, we can fetch Aunt&#xD;
Huldah's in just about seven or eight minutes."_&#xD;
"By what magical wand," said Melville, "do you&#xD;
expect to change winter to summer, that we may sail&#xD;
on the Oayuga this morning ?"&#xD;
The question is-easy of solution," replied Fred.&#xD;
Those-of our readers who have never seen one of&#xD;
the ice-boats which are common upon the inland&#xD;
lakes of western New York have yet one thing to&#xD;
feet wonder at, if they do not express it. Should they&#xD;
dare the trial, they will conclude that steam does not&#xD;
yet equal the wind s a propelling power. Two&#xD;
miles in a minute have been done by a gentleman&#xD;
who resides not far from  one scene of ,this story.&#xD;
The managementof an ice-boat is.very simple. It&#xD;
is so constructed that it obeys most of the laws&#xD;
.which govern wind navigation. Next to the bal-&#xD;
on, a sailin an ice-boat is the most exciting experi-&#xD;
4mentof travel. For the balloon part of this remark,&#xD;
solely upon descriptive education.&#xD;
benMelvillehohad accompanied Fred, Mor-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
timer to the ice-boat, yaw the singular looking craft,&#xD;
he turned in mute astonishment.&#xD;
"The manly skippers down on your sea-clad isle,&#xD;
Melville, have deeds wondrous and daring to relate;&#xD;
but I can show them all a trick with that craft."&#xD;
Sayingthis, he put the sail in trim and took the&#xD;
tiller. Instantly, as the wind filled the canvas, the&#xD;
boat shot from the land like a ball from a piece of&#xD;
ordnance. Melville fairly trembled at the frightful&#xD;
speed to which they attained. In about the time&#xD;
specified by Frederick Mortimer they had passed the&#xD;
six miles. As they neared the shore, Fred ordered&#xD;
the sail to be gradually lowered, thus reducing the&#xD;
speed of the boat by degrees.&#xD;
" There, Mr. Melville, can you make your affidavit&#xD;
that we are over six miles from our bachelor home ?"&#xD;
asked Fred.&#xD;
"No, indeed," replied Melville. "This must be the&#xD;
craft Baron Munchausen mistook for an eagle when&#xD;
he rode to the north pole, and ran against a frozen&#xD;
cloud."&#xD;
"Very likely," replied Fred. "Now for a charge&#xD;
upon Aunt Huldah's, breakfast. We will take the&#xD;
back entrance and rouse them in primitive style, as&#xD;
in days when log walls and a single room on the&#xD;
ground floor were considered luxurious."&#xD;
They were approaching the house.&#xD;
"Ha ! ha !" laughed Fred. "How Bell will pull&#xD;
my ears! It won't hurt them much, for theyfeel the&#xD;
effects of that six miles in no time at all. All I&#xD;
care for, however, is that they shall not be found&#xD;
frozen."&#xD;
Let the reader go with us to Bell Mortimer's apart-&#xD;
ment, in her aunt's hose, on this frosty morning.&#xD;

Lt half-past five o docl , Bell awakened from a.&#xD;
peacefulslumber.&#xD;
"No sluggard shall I be this morning !" said&#xD;
she.&#xD;
Rising hastily, she threw on a morning dress, and&#xD;
turned her attention to the stove. In a few moments,&#xD;
a bright fire rewarded her industry. Practical,.&#xD;
wasn't she ?&#xD;
"Now, Master Fred;" said she to herself, "if you&#xD;
dare come here this week, I will kiss you until you&#xD;
Will be glad to let me alone for the future. Ha ! ha!&#xD;
I wonder what Fred said when he found Pony gone.&#xD;
There is a sail! -Fred ! as true as I live ! Yes, and'&#xD;
that young whaler from Martha's Vineyard.' I should&#xD;
think he might stay at Martha's Vineyard, and not.&#xD;
come here to trouble Aunt Huldah's Vineyard."&#xD;
She took her aunt's large telescope, and satisfied&#xD;
herself that the ice-boat was really Fred's. Then,&#xD;
laying it aside, she ran to the kitchen, and changed&#xD;
materially her aunt's orders for breakfast.&#xD;
"Hurry, Jane!' Don't let Aunt Huldah know&#xD;
anything about my interference, though," said she&#xD;
to the servant.&#xD;
Putting her own hands to the work, the table was&#xD;
re-set in five minutes. Bell then flew to her room,&#xD;
.nd, in a time 'which, we fear, will appear almost&#xD;
imcredible to the mass of our lady readers, she was&#xD;
arrayed in most exquisite morning costume, appro-&#xD;
prate as it was rich.&#xD;
She then went to her aunt's room, who was just&#xD;
about leaving it to proceed to the kitchen; for the&#xD;
purpose of making the final arrangements fortthe&#xD;
-breakfast.&#xD;
"+    dear aunty ; you'mustnot leave your room&#xD;
&#xD;
in that costume. It does not compare well withr&#xD;
mine," and Bell kissed her aunt good morning.&#xD;
" Oh, this will do, child," said her aunt.&#xD;
"No! it won't do at all. My orders are impera-&#xD;
tive, and you know, Aunt Huldah, you will have no&#xD;
peace unless they are obeyed. I promise to tease&#xD;
you for two days, unless you make an instant change.&#xD;
I shall see to the breakfast."&#xD;
"Very well," said her aunt, smiling affectionately&#xD;
upon her favorite niece. "You shall be gratified."&#xD;
Her aunt soon arrayed herself to suit Bell's most&#xD;
fastidious taste. She now descended to the dining-&#xD;
.room.&#xD;
"Why, what are you- about, Bell Mortimer? All&#xD;
my best breakfast-set !"&#xD;
"Of course, Aunt Huldah !" replied Bell, laugh-&#xD;
ing, in high spirits. "Don't you think they match&#xD;
well with our morning costumesI Your dress is&#xD;
beautiful."&#xD;
"I am really afraid you are fast becoming a spoiled&#xD;
child.  I shall talk to Brother Benjamin about&#xD;
this."&#xD;
"No! no ! Don't youtell pa!"&#xD;
Bell and her aunt took their seats, Bell at the end&#xD;
of the table, as carver; her aunt poured out the&#xD;
coffee:&#xD;
"Here, Jane, hand this cup of coffee to Miss Mor-&#xD;
timer," said her aunt.&#xD;
At this instant, a noise was heard in the kitchen.&#xD;
" What is that, Jane?" -said Bell's aunt. "Go and&#xD;
see who are in the kitchen."&#xD;
a Yes, ma'am !" and she started to open the kitchen&#xD;
door.&#xD;
In this she- was anticipated by. Fred Motier.&#xD;

&#xD;
Goodmorning, Aunt Huldah!" said Fred. "Good&#xD;

"Good morning, sir," said Bell, rising from her&#xD;
seat, and assuming the dignity of a hostess, who is&#xD;
aboutto do the honors of her house to strangers.&#xD;
"It is rather cool this morning. You have taken an&#xD;
early start.. Ah, Mr. Melville," said she, with a&#xD;
most bewitchingly provocative smile, as much as to&#xD;
say: Gentlemen, I have outwitted you. "There,&#xD;
sirs, are seats for you at table ; as soon as you can&#xD;
appear in a presentable condition, I will introduce&#xD;
youto the lady of the house.".&#xD;
Her aunt read the solution of Bell's wishes in&#xD;
regard to her dress. She also saw that Bell was&#xD;
acting a part, and determined not to mar it by any&#xD;
unhappy interference. She remained quiet and&#xD;
seated.&#xD;
The gentlemen divested themselves of their heavy&#xD;
garments.&#xD;
"Shall I not do the carving, Miss Mortimer $"&#xD;
asked Fred.&#xD;
"Indeed, sir, you may, on your own fortune, but&#xD;
not on this meat. Mr. Melville, allow me to present&#xD;
you to my aunt, Mrs. Thompson. Aunt Huldah, this&#xD;
SMr. Melville, of whom you have heard me speak.&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer, I believe, needs none of my services,&#xD;
as he is acquainted with Mrs. Thompson. Mr. Mel-&#xD;
11e allow me to present you with this plate. You&#xD;
xn:ust have gained an appetite by your morning&#xD;

ILcan assure you I have and will accept the plate,&#xD;

Bell.&#xD;
"I shal be guided by circumstances; and, in&#xD;
reply to your first query, it is agreeable rather than&#xD;
laborious.  The ren'ark intervening between the&#xD;
questions demands my Very humble thanks. In reply&#xD;
to the last query, allow m to say, I am obedient to&#xD;
my companion."&#xD;
"It was Fred's turn now to enjoy tell's confusion.&#xD;
She blushed in a very inteesiing, impromptu style ;&#xD;
but, rallying, she dropped her assumed dignity, and&#xD;
welcomed the young gentlernenwith a warm heart,&#xD;
which contrasted well with the cold comfort of their,&#xD;
ride in the ice-boat.  At four o'clock P.M., Mrs.&#xD;
Thompson ordered her horses, two spirited animals,&#xD;
to be harnessed before a new double sleigh.&#xD;
"Now, gentlemen," said Mrs. Thompson, "you&#xD;
may go back to Aurora as you came, and get every-&#xD;
thing in readiness for visitors; myself and Miss Mor-&#xD;
timer purpose taking tea with you, and spending the&#xD;
night."&#xD;
" That's cool !" said Fred, laughingly.&#xD;
"Very, Mr. Mortimer," replied his aunt.  "It&#xD;
matches with the weather, sir. Good bye. John,&#xD;
let go of their heads."&#xD;
Mrs. Thompson was a lady who, possessing all the&#xD;
sentiment of woman, gave proof of masculine cou-&#xD;
rage. Her life in the country had schooled her in&#xD;
the management of horses. A drive with the beauti&#xD;
tiful span of shining black five-year-olds, was her&#xD;
greatest pastime.&#xD;
"They have left us to work our' passage home,&#xD;
Mr. Melville," said Fred.&#xD;
"Yes, sir; and, judging from the merry jingleof&#xD;

their sleigh-bells, we will have to lose no time to be&#xD;
at Aurora in advance," replied Melville.&#xD;
"Now for it, then I The wind has freshened since&#xD;
morning, ppt the direction is all right," said Fred.&#xD;
In fewer moments than it- takes to record the fact,&#xD;
Melville and Fred, as if by magic, were safely at&#xD;
Aurora, awaiting the arrival of the ladies. Melville,&#xD;
looking at his watch, remarked-&#xD;
°"They must be here now in about twenty minutes.&#xD;
I will take a walk, and meet them."&#xD;
"As you please,". said Fred.  "I won't answer&#xD;
for their condescension in recognizing any way-&#xD;
farers."&#xD;
" I would not, if I had a certain friend for a com-&#xD;
panion,"-replied Melville. " As you are so much en-&#xD;
gaged, I will risk the condescension, and go."&#xD;
Suiting the action to the word, Melville started.&#xD;
He walked briskly through the main street-in fact,&#xD;
Aurora has but one street worthy the title-until he&#xD;
had reached the open country. Near this place, the&#xD;
road descends into a ravine, making, of consequence,.&#xD;
a hill to. descend and a hill to climb. When he had&#xD;
walked about half-way down the hill on his side of&#xD;
the ravine, he heard a cry of terror coming from the&#xD;
road beyond the opposite hill. Of course, he could&#xD;
not see from whence the cry proceeded. He deter-&#xD;
ned; however, to hasten his steps, and to this end,&#xD;
wasabout pressing his hat more firmly upon his&#xD;
S d, preparatory to running down into the ravine.&#xD;
this :instant, a span of horses, which he recognized&#xD;
as Mrs. Thompson's, came over the brow of the op-&#xD;
posite hill, wild with fright, and at the top. of their&#xD;
speed. For an instant, and but for an instant, a film&#xD;

G EORG E MELVILLE.      ~     47&#xD;
soul was aroused to a wild but determined resolve.&#xD;
The pace at which the infuriated animals descended&#xD;
to the ravine, was indeed frightful. Melville uttered&#xD;
one prayer that the sleigh might not be dashed in&#xD;
pieces against the railing of a small bridge.&#xD;
"Thank God they have passed that bridge !" He&#xD;
now recognized Mrs. Thompson and Bell. Onward,&#xD;
and up the hill, the maddened animals came; thQ&#xD;
ascent, seemingly, had no-effect to abate their pace.&#xD;
Melville stood exactly in the centre of the road. He&#xD;
determined to stop the animals, or lose his life in the&#xD;
attempt.  He saw before him a slight pitch-hole.-&#xD;
Advancing to it, he stepped a pace out of the path&#xD;
(in jockey parlance) of the"" of horse." When they&#xD;
had arrived within ten or fifteen feet of his position,&#xD;
he turned, and began running up the hill, keeping&#xD;
his eye upon the horse nearer to him. The animals&#xD;
were soon abreast of him. By. a quick but sure&#xD;
and firm grasp with his right hand, he seized one of&#xD;
the reins about a foot from the'bit; at the same&#xD;
instant, he threw the whole force of his body against&#xD;
the side of the horse, and grasped, with the left hand,&#xD;
his mane. The pace now became tremendous; with&#xD;
almost superhuman courage and strength, Melville&#xD;
succeeded in gaining the back of the off horse. The&#xD;
task before him was one, which, even in this position,&#xD;
was attended with difficulty. To upset the sleigh&#xD;
was almost certain death to its occupants. To pull:&#xD;
upon one rein would certainly do this. After sever&#xD;
vain attempts, he succeeded in gathering up tie&#xD;
lines. This accomplished, the rest of his task  was&#xD;
comparatively easy. Several men had by this time&#xD;
appeared upon the scene. They grasped the horses&#xD;
by their heads, and cried to Maelville to dismount.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7805-00000076"/>&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Melville; gave no response. One of the increasing&#xD;
crowd, going up to Melville, attempted to, assist him&#xD;
to dismount. To his astonishment; Melville was per-&#xD;
fectly uncoiscious, and, but for this assistance, would&#xD;
have fallen to the ground.. Both Mrs. Thompson&#xD;
and Bell, although uninjured, except from a terrible&#xD;
fright, had been led into the nearest house. As yet,&#xD;
they knew nothing of the circumstances attending&#xD;
their safety.  Mrs. Thompson was handing Bell a&#xD;
glass of water, when the door opened, and several&#xD;
men bore Melville into the next room.&#xD;
Bell and Mrs. Thompson were now sufficiently re-&#xD;
covered from their fright to learn the particulars of&#xD;
their rescue.&#xD;
" Who is that ?" said Bell. "What has hurt him ?"&#xD;
Has that man been injured by the horses ?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Thompson; is he seriously hurt ?"&#xD;
These and other questions of like import were&#xD;
asked in quick succession by each, in short and&#xD;
nervous accents. No one present could tell the name&#xD;
of the wounded man. All they could learn was, that&#xD;
ie was a stranger.; had been seen walking down the&#xD;
road only a few moments before ; and that, at the&#xD;
peril of his life, he had stopped the horses and ap-.&#xD;
parently, at least, saved them from a horrible death.&#xD;
Both Bell and, her aunt were anxious to enter the&#xD;
room and render assistance. But they were prevented&#xD;
by some.gentlemen, who informed them that,, at&#xD;
present, ladies could be of no service.&#xD;
"A few moments more, Miss Mortimer, and the&#xD;
surgeon will have set the bone," said a bystander.&#xD;
"Has he a broken bone ?" said Mrs. Thompson.&#xD;
"Yes, ma'm," answered the bystander; Is right&#xD;
deg  broken below the knee."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Who is he? Do, do let me go to him!" -said&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
"The horses are all safe, Mrs. Thompson, and so is&#xD;
the sleigh," said a boy, coming into the room-&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," said Mrs. Thompson. "Iyam&#xD;
glad they are safe; but I would rather have lost a&#xD;
dozen horses and sleighs than that this gentleman&#xD;
should have been injured."&#xD;
A groan from the wounded man reached the ears&#xD;
of the ladies. Bell was in a state of the most acute&#xD;
trial. Such suffering from one who had risked his&#xD;
life to save her from a terrible destruction, was indeed&#xD;
a bitter, bitter trial. Bell at that moment truthfully,&#xD;
sincerely, from her heart of sympathy, wished that&#xD;
she had been the one to suffer.&#xD;
By this time curiosity had been somewhat allayed.&#xD;
The surgeon ordered the room to be cleared. With&#xD;
the exception of one or two persons, this was imme-&#xD;
diately done.&#xD;
Can Miss Mortimer and Mrs. Thompson see their&#xD;
deliverer, Dr. Bond ?" said the lady who was the&#xD;
unasked but willing hostess of this unexpected com-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
"Miss Mortimer! Mrs. Thompson! Why, Mrs.&#xD;
Jewett, are they the ,ladies whose lives this gentle-&#xD;
man has-saved ?" said the kind-hearted surgeon.&#xD;
"Yes, sir; it was Mrs. Thompson's blacks? Some-&#xD;
thing about the harness gave way, which frightened&#xD;
the horses."&#xD;
You may present my compliments, Mrs. Jewett,&#xD;
and ask them to come in."&#xD;
"Thank you, doctor" replied Mrs. Jewett&#xD;
Before Melville, who would have prevented their&#xD;
entrance, could be heard Dr. Bond's message had&#xD;

been delivered, and the door was immediately opened.&#xD;
Mrs . Thompson was first to enter. Advancing, she&#xD;
took  Melville's hand, and, without recognizing&#xD;
hime reyes suffusing with tears, she spoke her&#xD;
thanks and sympathies in short and broken sen-&#xD;
tences.&#xD;
Melville could have endured all but the. tears. A&#xD;
woman weeping for him, was not what he had been&#xD;
accustomed to.- The effort to endure them evidently&#xD;
troubled him.&#xD;
The doctor saw this effect, and hastily warned the&#xD;
ladies to be short in their visit.&#xD;
Bell, advancing as Nirs. Thompson retired, also&#xD;
failed to recognize her deliverer. She took his hand&#xD;
and was about speaking, when their eyes met. Mel-&#xD;
ville's gaze, at first, was lighted- by the keenest rays&#xD;
of a soul which has learned but too well to love&#xD;
where he deems another seeker has found the jewel.&#xD;
As Bell became conscious that George Melville lay&#xD;
upon that couch of suffering, like lightning came the&#xD;
thoughts of the past;. the dreamy thoughts ; the un-&#xD;
bidden presence in hours of reverie ; the flitting pic-&#xD;
tures of his manly form; his darkly beaming eye ;&#xD;
his rich-toned voice ; his respectful watchfulness for&#xD;
her comfort;. his graceful, manly ease; his nobleness&#xD;
of soul, evinced by his every word and .deed; she&#xD;
felt at 1aat moment that happiness on earth for her&#xD;
must come from. George Melville's love. Her eye&#xD;
was a faithful tell-tale to Melville for what, since he&#xD;
frst met Bell, he had not dared to hope, even in&#xD;
secret. A rich blush suffused her temples. As, the&#xD;
soul-spoken truth that Bell Mortimer loved him struck&#xD;
the answering chord in-Melville's heart, the indices&#xD;
of pain and suffering vanished from his face; his eye&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
kindled with a flame of purest joy; an angel's peace&#xD;
had fallen upon his brow. A smile, which told Bell&#xD;
Mortimer better than words, that in health or suffer-&#xD;
ing, wealth or poverty, life or death, henceforth he&#xD;
lived but for her, flitted over his countenance. Fondly&#xD;
pressing the soft, white hand which had remained in&#xD;
his grasp, he carried it respectfully to his lips and&#xD;
imprinted thereon a kiss of holy love. Bell gently,&#xD;
but to Melville's keen perception, unmistakably, re-&#xD;
turned the pressure. Again his eye told her of his&#xD;
love. Forgetting those around, her soul kindled with&#xD;
sympathy for his suffering, gratitude for her life, and&#xD;
the joy of a new and indescribable happiness. She&#xD;
knelt by his couch of pain and 'imprinted upon his&#xD;
manly brow the seal of a devotion which from that&#xD;
instant was never broken. 'George Melville whis-&#xD;
pered in her ear :&#xD;
"May God watch over thee, dearest, dearest trea-&#xD;
sure-!&#xD;
Bell's eyes were suffused with tears. She 'turned&#xD;
to Mrs. Jewett, and in a soft, but steady articulation,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"I cannot thank him now ! let us return ! another&#xD;
time ! he must rest!Y Doctor, you vill remain&#xD;
here over night with me? Mrs. Jewett, please send&#xD;
a messenger for my brother, Frederick. I can never&#xD;
repay your kindness !"&#xD;
" Don't speak of that," said Mrs. Jewett, herself&#xD;
wiping the warm tears from her own eyes with her&#xD;
clean check apron. "I can tell you tales of kindness,&#xD;
sympathy, aye, and free purse strings, from  your&#xD;
great grandfather down to the poor woman who&#xD;
wore the new cloak to church last Sunday morning,&#xD;
made by Bell Mortimer's own fingers. You didn't&#xD;

do that so still as you thought," said Mrs. Jewett, the&#xD;
teas flowing afresh iii spite of herself.&#xD;
Bell turned away to hide her confusion.&#xD;
Bell Mortjmer had left her aunt's one hour before&#xD;
with a joyous spirit. Through life she had gambolled&#xD;
over hill, dale and valley--no crags-no mountain&#xD;
gorges-no rocky heights, had obstructed her path-&#xD;
way. Time had gently lifted his sickle above her,&#xD;
while gathering from around her home, recruits for&#xD;
the heavenly hosts. Friends and faithful had watched&#xD;
her from infancy. Hitherto, earth had no joys for&#xD;
her, except in a "father's smile," a mother's love,&#xD;
and a brother's confidence. Her father was the sun-&#xD;
light ; her mother, the moon-light; her brother, the&#xD;
shield' from every storm and tempest. To father,&#xD;
mother and brother she was the&#xD;
"Wabun Annung-the star of morning."&#xD;
One short hour, and how     changed !  She had&#xD;
perilled existence. The portals of heaven had been&#xD;
unlatched, and one bright- ray of glory had flashed&#xD;
therefrom. The angel harps had ceased; the expec-&#xD;
tant host in the seraphic choir had watched, with&#xD;
eager love, the fiery steeds of earth, ready to make&#xD;
heaven's arches ring anew when her spotless soul&#xD;
should preach its angel home.. But "Time," with&#xD;
hoary lock, looked again and again over the instruc-&#xD;
tions which he dare not contravene. The page was&#xD;
blurred. Uncertain in his task, he&#xD;
Turned back, with restless wing,&#xD;
And gazed on heaven's throne,&#xD;
From whence he e'er has flown,&#xD;
Where sat her God and King.&#xD;

"Beautiful daughter of earth, finish thy task !&#xD;
For a season, I pass thee by."&#xD;

XXII&#xD;
Plans for the Future.&#xD;
A LTrrrLE after five o'clock, Frederick Mortimer&#xD;
entered Mrs. Jewett's house. On his way, he heard&#xD;
several reports in regard to his sister and aunt.&#xD;
He was prepared to find them injured; how much,&#xD;
he dreaded to learn. The transition from' anxiety to&#xD;
joy at their. safety, caused his heart to leap. He&#xD;
clasped Bell to his arms kissing her again and&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Bell!" said Fred, "you perceive run-aways do&#xD;
not prosper. Take warning from this, and never&#xD;
strike up arun-away match. Always consult your&#xD;
brother, in future. How is the pony to get home ?"&#xD;
"Fred, dear Fred !" said Bell, "I cannot bear even&#xD;
the pleasantry of joy at my preservation. You have&#xD;
a duty to perform towards my preserver."&#xD;
".A duty? What is it, Bell? Who is your pre-&#xD;
server "&#xD;
"George Melville, Frederick. He has risked his&#xD;
life to save your sister's. He lies in the front parlor,&#xD;
suffering terrible pain from a broken leg. Dr. Bond&#xD;
says his right leg is broken just below the knee. He&#xD;
also says he has a severe flesh wound."'&#xD;
;Frederick Mortimer's levity instantly vanished.:&#xD;
He went to his friend's bedside.,&#xD;
&#xD;
"George, I can, now, only thank you for the lives&#xD;
of my sister and aunt," said he, taking Melville's&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
Melville smiled upon Frederick-his answer. his&#xD;
smile seemed to say, "Frederick, even life would&#xD;
have been well spent if yielded for such a cause."&#xD;
" We must look this sad event sternly in its face,&#xD;
George. I am glad this occurred in Aurora, where&#xD;
our efforts to sympathize with you cannot be refused,&#xD;
or joined in. Dr. Bond, can Mr. Melville be re-&#xD;
moved to my father's residence ?"&#xD;
"Not at present, Frederick."&#xD;
"I fear we shall have to force upon Mrs. Jewett&#xD;
what, to her, will be a burden," said Frederick.&#xD;
"I require no urging," interposed Mrs. Jewett;&#xD;
"the very necessity would make the duty a pleasure,&#xD;
if, indeed, I owed nothing of sympathy, who have re-&#xD;
ceived so many proofs of kindness from your family,&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer."'&#xD;
"'What can't be cured must be endured,'" said&#xD;
Frederick. "One thing is certain, George will be&#xD;
the gainer, now that he~has lost his locomotion for a&#xD;
season. A better nurse than is Mrs. Jewett don't live&#xD;
in Aurora."&#xD;
"You judge from hearsay, Frederick," said the&#xD;
lady in question.&#xD;
"Public opinion, Mrs. Jewett," replied Fred.&#xD;
" Which often manufactures character to order,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Jewett.&#xD;
"This time, if I am a judge, my friend Melville&#xD;
found it ready made," said Frederick.&#xD;
"Such as it is, he will have to abide by,"said.Mrs.&#xD;
Jewett;  "There ! is that more comfortable, Mr.&#xD;
Melville ? Let me moisten the bandages once more."&#xD;

"Thank you, Mrs. Jewett," replied Melville.&#xD;
"Now he must have rest. No more talking," said&#xD;
Dr. Bond, " I prohibit it."&#xD;
That night, Bell, Mrs. Jewett, Frederick Mortimer,&#xD;
and Dr. Bond watched over George Melville.&#xD;
Some days passed before the'surgeon deemed it safe&#xD;
toremove Melville to Mr. Mortimer's house. It was&#xD;
done at the earliest moment practicable. Up to this&#xD;
time, both Bell and her brother had remained con-&#xD;
stantly at Mrs. Jewett's. If duty demanded this, the&#xD;
duty was certainly fully performed.J&#xD;
It was a clear star-light night, about a month sub-&#xD;
sequent.to Melville's injury, that Bell and her brother&#xD;
Frederick might have been. seen in the front parlor&#xD;
of their father's house, sitting upon a sofa drawn&#xD;

"How is George, Fred ?" said Bell.&#xD;
"Quite comfortable ;" replied Fred. "Where did&#xD;
you obtain that beautiful bouquet, Bell?"-&#xD;
"From the B-.k Nursery at Auburn," Fred.&#xD;
"Those flowers are welcomed up stairs. Bell, I&#xD;
gant to ask you a home question. You need not&#xD;
answer it unless you choose."&#xD;
" I have no secrets from my brother," replied&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
"Bell," continued Frederick; "has George Mel-&#xD;
ville taken advantage of circumstances, to turn your&#xD;
gratitude into a warmer sentiment ?"&#xD;
"lHe has. not, Frederick; but, forgive me brother,&#xD;
in not speaking this from my own impulse, his love&#xD;
i mine and it is reciprocated."&#xD;
"When did he speak this Bell ?"&#xD;
"ihas never spoken- it, Frederick."&#xD;
"Never?".&#xD;

"lHe is too honorable to ask my heart as a proof&#xD;

"Are you engaged to each other ?"&#xD;
" We love, Frederick. This is mutual; but, no&#xD;
words have passed between us on the subject. If;&#xD;
our lives are spared, George will become your brother&#xD;
Fred. Trust me that he has not transcended the&#xD;
sphere of friendship in this matter."&#xD;
"Well, and what of Mordaunt ?" asked Fred.&#xD;
"Father can never have his wish gratified.in his&#xD;
behalf," replied Bell.&#xD;
"Suppose he demands that you marry Mordaunt.,"&#xD;
" My brother will shield his sister !"&#xD;
"Suppose, if he dare not make, such a demand, he&#xD;
does prohibit a union with Melville ?" asked Fred.&#xD;
" Then he will see his daughter droop and die"-&#xD;
and Bell nestled her cheek in her brother's bosom.&#xD;
The throbbing pulse, the contracted brow, the&#xD;
earnestness of truth, but no gathering tears, told&#xD;
Frederick Mortimer, that Bell's were not idle words.&#xD;
His sister's happiness was. really, at stake; perhaps&#xD;
her life. He knew his father and mother better than&#xD;
did Bell.. He knew they were determined upon&#xD;
Bell's union with Mordaunt; and, while he feltthat&#xD;
his father would never actually force Bell to his&#xD;
wishes, Bell could not marry another, with his con-&#xD;
sent. As he informed Bell of this, he advised her&#xD;
to keep her own secret at present.&#xD;
"George must graduate and study a profession&#xD;
before you can be united. There is no necessity of&#xD;
borrowing trouble in advance. Again, Bell; if father&#xD;
and another are informed of this, and oppose you for&#xD;
Mordaunt's advantage they will make Mordaunt&#xD;
their confidant, and thus set a 'bitter enemy at'work&#xD;

If we can keep entirely this visit and accident from&#xD;
father and mother, it would be better. We will try&#xD;
to, and if they discover it by accident, they will set&#xD;
t down to our-own fear of frightening them. They&#xD;
not return until some time in March. How for-&#xD;

Washington letters! But we must not forget our&#xD;
patient. Good night, Bell. I approve your choice.&#xD;
If that will bring sleep to your heavy eye-lids, I&#xD;
shall feel a conscience clear."&#xD;
(We may as well here inform the reader of Hon. B.&#xD;
F. Mortimer's reelection to Congress.)&#xD;
"It will, dear brother! Call me, if necessary."&#xD;
Kissing her brother, Bell retired to her pillow, but&#xD;
not to sleep: a presentiment of coning evil "cast its&#xD;
shadow over her souTl" making thought to glow with&#xD;
intensity.&#xD;
The' first week in April, Melville, accompanied by&#xD;
Frederick Mortimer, although yet unable to use his&#xD;
right limb; went by easy journeys to his home. His&#xD;
history, sinceJanuary, detailed to Melville's parents&#xD;
by Frederick, caused a sensation indeed. But the&#xD;
battle :had been fought and the wounded .cared for.&#xD;
Sympathy and sorrow were rendered,, therefore, un-&#xD;
welcome. The joy of Melville's parents at his preser-&#xD;
nation mingled with the pride which naturally would&#xD;
flow:from sith an exhibition of true courage and.&#xD;
manhood. In reply to repeated queries from his&#xD;
father, George always insisted that he never knew&#xD;
when or how he .had broken his leg. The only hy-&#xD;
pothesis he offered on the subject was, that after he&#xD;
had caught hold of the horse's mane, his:right leg&#xD;
miight have struck upon the road.&#xD;

"Yes, George," replied Griswold, "but I have&#xD;
been a miserable dolt about everything, else.  I&#xD;
might have suspected you had broken your head or&#xD;
understanding, and were too proud to acknowledge&#xD;
it. A little exercise of mother wit might have ex-&#xD;

&#xD;
versation, the village of Clinton, in Oneida County&#xD;
N. Y., was thronged with visitors from all parts of&#xD;
the United States. We do not propose to give the&#xD;
reader a description of the exercises at a college com-&#xD;
mencement. However interesting such a theme&#xD;
would, doubtless, prove, it has no place here. A&#xD;
little circumstance, however, occurred on the occa-&#xD;
sion referred to, which, although very trifling, was&#xD;
important in its results. At 10 o'clock, A.M., a pro-&#xD;
cession, consisting of the college students, members&#xD;
of the Faculty, alumni, distinguished strangers, citi-&#xD;
zens, etc , was formed in front of the Clinton Hotel,&#xD;
preceded by a band of music.&#xD;
"Ah, ".Iimball! Here at last !" said Thomas Gris-&#xD;
wold to one of his classmates, whose arrival he had&#xD;
been anxiously looking for.&#xD;
"Yes; I am here physically, but absent mentally,"&#xD;
returned his classmate.&#xD;
Mr. Griswold, let me introduce to -you a young&#xD;
friend who has come on to ridicule college life, -and&#xD;
exalt the barter- and sale of trade," said Kimball.&#xD;
"With pleasure," replied Griswold.&#xD;
"Mr. Griswold-Mr. Hastings."&#xD;
"I am   happy to make your acquaintance, Mr.&#xD;
Hastings," said Griswold.&#xD;
The young man, to whom Griswold was thus intro-&#xD;
duced, was apparently about eighteen or nineteen&#xD;
years of age; small in stature, having .lack hair&#xD;
falling drom  his temples in graceful curls, black&#xD;
eyes, a regular set of teeth, of exqpisite mould and&#xD;
whiteness, eye-brows heavy and black, and,; com-&#xD;
plexion clear and brilliant. Young Hastings acknow-&#xD;
gedged the attention of Griswold with some constraint,&#xD;
or;apparent reserve, which proceeded 'from   and&#xD;

accorded well with his youth. The impression he&#xD;
made uponpCriswold was favorable. Griswold, how-&#xD;
ever, at the time thought no more of him. They&#xD;
did not again meet in Clinton; but his peculiar,&#xD;
almost feminine beauty, caused Griswold to bear&#xD;
away Hastings's features upon his memory. Two&#xD;
months subsequent to this incident, Griswold was a&#xD;
law  student- in New York city. While passing&#xD;
through Barclay street, one pleasant morning, whither&#xD;
he had gone on behalf of-his- employers, to obtain&#xD;
a clue to some facts- necessary to be proven in an&#xD;
action at law then pending, he was suddenly accosted&#xD;
by William Hastings.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mr. Griswold," said Hastings.&#xD;
"Ah, my friend Kimball's companion of Com-&#xD;
mencement Day. I am very happy -to meet you.&#xD;
When did you arrive in New York, sir?"&#xD;
"Yesterday. I came by the Albany boat," replied&#xD;
Hastings.&#xD;
" Do you remain in town long? Call and see me,&#xD;
if it shall prove convenient. My address, after 7&#xD;
o'clock, r.at., is No.  Fourteenth street, or No.-&#xD;
Wall street, during business hours. Have you decided&#xD;
between study and work ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. I am looking for a clerkship, in some&#xD;
importing house. I have two offers already, but&#xD;
they do dot please me fully. I have a large country&#xD;
acquaintance, but find that a clerk in an importing&#xD;
house needs an extended city acquaintance among&#xD;
the heavy jobbers,; in order to command  a large&#xD;
salary. That I lark."&#xD;
"And that, 'my young find, I can give you, and&#xD;
will do so with the greatest pleasure," interposed,&#xD;
Grisrwold. "Get a good place to domesticate yone&#xD;

self, and rely on me, Hastings, for the acquaintance&#xD;
and situation both. We will seek the situation first,&#xD;
then attend- to making the acquaintances, and, in&#xD;
s  inaonths, or a year, you can offer your own terms&#xD;
as to salary, provided you are a worker. You are&#xD;
young, but I will hope you will show an old head&#xD;
upon young shoulders."&#xD;
The plan here marked, Griswold immediately set&#xD;
himself to work out. In this he was successful&#xD;
beyondthe young man's best dream. He obtained for&#xD;
him a clerkship in one of the oldest and best import-&#xD;
ing houses in New York, and in six months had&#xD;
introduced him to many of the best jobbers in the&#xD;
city. At the end of one year, Hastings, by steady&#xD;
and earnest application to business, through Gris-&#xD;
wold's patronage, became an efficient salesman, and&#xD;
commanded a salary at once of fifteen hundred per&#xD;
annum.&#xD;
Business in the larger cities is done on the prin-&#xD;
ciple which the learned SA, in his political economy,&#xD;
calls "Division of labor." Importers, jobbers, and&#xD;
retailers are alike merchants. The importer brings&#xD;
the foreign merchandise. This he wholeales to the&#xD;
jobber. The jobber, in turn, wholesales it to the.&#xD;
retailer,,. through whom the merchandise finally&#xD;
reaches the consumer. Besides this, there are jobs&#xD;
bers of exclusively American fabrics and  iainufac-&#xD;
tures. In this case the home manfacturer holds the&#xD;
relation of an importer towards the jobber. A very&#xD;
few houses combine the three phases of the merchant.&#xD;
To accomplish this position successfully, forms the.&#xD;
exception to the great laws which govern trade, and&#xD;
the instances are rare. - As the resources of the&#xD;
United- States become more fully :developed, such&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.   163&#xD;
&#xD;
instances will, doubtless, become unheard of. The&#xD;
atmospheres wont mingle.&#xD;
William Hastings, before he came to New York to&#xD;
seek his fortune, had learned what every merchant&#xD;
should know, viz., the duties of a clerk in a country&#xD;
retail house. -"Energy, integrity, perseverance, fru-&#xD;
gality," had been his motto, when, at sixteen years of&#xD;
age, he became a clerk. It was instilled into him by&#xD;
his father-a farmer (in rustic parlance) considered&#xD;
by his neighbors to be "above board." He had now&#xD;
been engaged nearly eighteen months in his new&#xD;
capacity, and had formed a friendship for, Griswold'&#xD;
which, planted in gratitude, sprouted and grew upon&#xD;
a soil enriched by the noble motto which guided all&#xD;
his actions. Early in April, the following year, he&#xD;
called upon Griswold.&#xD;
"Good morning, William. I am really happy to&#xD;
see you at this particular hour, for I have got an&#xD;
attack of ennui," said Griswold, as Hastings entered,&#xD;
his office, at No. - Wall street.&#xD;
" Good morning, Mr. Griswold. I have come in tol&#xD;
say good@e to you."&#xD;
"Good le ?---and what for, pray ?" said Griswold.&#xD;
"I have planned a little trip for my own improve-&#xD;
ment. Although my employers are men of thrift&#xD;
and great experience, still they buy a great many&#xD;
goods which are unsalable. There is some radical&#xD;
mistake about all this, and I have determined to&#xD;
attempt a solution of the problem, and, if possible,&#xD;
get at the true answer. We have between thirty and&#xD;
forty thousand dollars invested in goods which must&#xD;
go at fifty per cent. below cost. True, it is a small&#xD;
item, compared to the sum total of our importations;&#xD;
.but I believe a loss of twenty thousand "dollars, in&#xD;

&#xD;
this way, is wholly unnecessary. Our profits for the&#xD;
ye arfoot up about two hundred thousand; but they&#xD;
might, i4 my judgment, have reached twenty thou-&#xD;
sand more:  I have about three hundred dollars&#xD;
extra now, and propose to take a trip South And&#xD;
West, endeavoring, on the way, to obtain a knob-&#xD;
ledge of the state of the country ; what sections bid&#xD;
fairto prosper next fall; what kind of fabrics they&#xD;
will require; what are the habits of society in the&#xD;
thrifty-looking counties; what will be the prevailing&#xD;
fashions there; and, finally, to determine approxi-&#xD;
mately the amount of, goods which the thrifty sec-&#xD;
tions will require, and the proportion, according to&#xD;
taste, fashion, education, and habits, between goods&#xD;
intrinsically valuable, and goods which show valua-&#xD;
able, but, intrinsically, are cheap. There is a chart&#xD;
,of the South and West ready for my figures. What&#xD;
do you think of the plan ?"&#xD;
"It is good !-capital! Success to you, and draw&#xD;
on me if you want more means," said Griswold.&#xD;
The following day, Hastings left New York, upon&#xD;
his projected tour, having obtained leave of absence&#xD;
sufficient for his. purpose. He unfolded his plan to&#xD;
none but Griswold. The success which rewarded his&#xD;
efforts transcended his happiest anticipations. He&#xD;
arrived again in New York, late one stormy night.&#xD;
Onthefollowing morning, he asked of his employers&#xD;
a private consultation, laid before them his chart,&#xD;
gave a history of his trip, and marked, the conclu-&#xD;
sions he.had arrived at.  Those experienced men,&#xD;
from their long acquaintance with.travel, felt that if&#xD;
Castings' judgment had been good, the conclusions&#xD;
hedrew must be'of practical advantage. After two&#xD;
days' consultation, they informed him of their resolve&#xD;
&#xD;
to give his chart a trial. At all events, they argued,&#xD;
the risk is small, for a loss of twenty or thirty thou-&#xD;
sand dollars will be but a continuation of past his-&#xD;
tory.  Their purchases were made as to quantity,&#xD;
quality, and variety, according to the ratio indicated&#xD;
by Hastings. This was a new principle, of action in&#xD;
that house. Hitherto, their stocks had been pur-&#xD;
chased to suit all parts of the country ; now they had&#xD;
in store only such goods as Hastings had prophesied&#xD;
would be wanted. The question to be solved was,&#xD;
has Hastings judged well of the country?- When the&#xD;
fall season was over, the following three facts ex-&#xD;
pressed the result. Their shelves were almost empty;&#xD;
their losses, by failure of jobbers to meet their pay-&#xD;
ments, were not worthy an entry on the account of&#xD;
profit and loss : William Hastings had laid the foun-&#xD;
dation of his fortune; for, at the end of two years,&#xD;
when only twenty-one years of age, he became, a&#xD;
junior partner in the house, and the duty of princi-&#xD;
pal buyer was assigned to him. He now spent nearly&#xD;
all his time in travel, visiting. every part of the&#xD;
United States, and going twice each year to Europe.&#xD;
The second venture made upon his judgment was&#xD;
even more successful. As each season was con-&#xD;
cluded, rival houses envied the bare shelves of Blod-&#xD;
gett, Johnston, Hastings &amp;amp;' Co., and scolded their own&#xD;
salesmen for their want of skill in selling goods for&#xD;
which there was little call.&#xD;

WHEN does the next steamer arrive ?" said Thomas&#xD;
F. Griswold, about an hour after his father had&#xD;
placed his signature to the instrument assigning all&#xD;
his property to his creditors.&#xD;
"I am not 'certain what day she is due, Thomas,"&#xD;
replied his father, speaking in a half absent-minded&#xD;
tone, and heaving a deep sigh.&#xD;
Thomas Griswold leaned his head upon his hands,&#xD;
and for a long time both son and father were engaged&#xD;
with their own thoughts. Thomas was first to break&#xD;
the silence.&#xD;
"Father," said he, "I am going to be absent an&#xD;
hour or two.  If Mr. Edgemonte calls, you know&#xD;
what to say."-&#xD;
"Yes, Thomas. I would not care for the property,&#xD;
if it were not on your account. You, Thomas, are&#xD;
all I have to remind me of the companion of my&#xD;
youth-the wife and mother in heaven. It'is true,&#xD;
Thomas, you have not lost a wife; but I know your&#xD;
heart, and that it is broken."&#xD;
"Not until my father has reaped some fruit from&#xD;
his son's energies worthy the reaper's scythe nthen&#xD;
: then  there will be time to think of Clara Edge.&#xD;
Monte. She will be true to,. me! and more-hix&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
father will, be true to me. But accept nothing at his&#xD;
hands. 'There he comes now." And Thomas hastily&#xD;
left the room, and then the house, by the basement exit.&#xD;
Taking an omnibus, he went to the counting-house&#xD;
of "Blodgett, Johnston, Hastings &amp;amp; Co."&#xD;
" Mr. Blodgett ?" said Griswold.&#xD;
"That is my name, sir," said the senior partner of&#xD;
this firm, looking over his spectacles and placing&#xD;
himself in attitude for listening to Griswold.&#xD;
"Mr. William Hastings, I believe, sir, is a mem.&#xD;
ber of your firm."&#xD;
" He is, sir."&#xD;
"Will you tell me when you expect him to ar-&#xD;
rive in New York ?"&#xD;
"He will be here in the evening train from Al-&#xD;
bany."&#xD;
"I thought he was in Europe, sir," said Griswold,&#xD;
very happy at this information.&#xD;
"He returned to America three weeks since, but&#xD;
has been in Canada during that tie."&#xD;
Griswold sat down and wrote a short note, which&#xD;
he addressed to Hastings, and took his departure.&#xD;
At an early hour the following day, Mr. Hastings&#xD;
entered his counting-room. . All the partners were&#xD;
to be present, to listen to a report of his trip. One&#xD;
of the most important ventures ever made by. the&#xD;
firm  was to be discussed.  Mr. Blodgett was. the&#xD;
last to arrive. As he entered, he took Griswold's&#xD;
note -from a letter-rack and handed it to Hastings.&#xD;
The partners engaged in general conversation while&#xD;
Hastings read;the following:&#xD;

"   ewillhate t&amp;amp; postpone our consultation for an&#xD;

"Whiy, that is the son of James Griswold, who&#xD;

"Has James Griswold assigned ?" said Hastings,&#xD;
looking' up o the company with an earnest anxiety.&#xD;
"Yes. Does he owe you anything.&#xD;
"No,; but I do him, or his son rather." And iHast&#xD;
ings seized his hat, leaving his partners so suddenly'&#xD;
that they were lost in bewilderment.&#xD;
Opening the front door, he hastily called loudly to&#xD;
one- of the porters-&#xD;
" John, tell Mr. Blodgett I shall return or send him&#xD;
a note in an hour.-&#xD;
*  *      *      *     *      *      *&#xD;
" Mr. Griswold," said Hastings, as he entered his&#xD;
office, " what is it about this assignment? *Tell me,&#xD;
my dear friend. Has your father been ruined ? and&#xD;
how?"&#xD;
"Yes;, he has made an assignment. His assets&#xD;
will not meet his liabilities.  I will give you a&#xD;
history of the whole affair. He made an invest-&#xD;
ni- ent-'" ----&#xD;
"Is the story a long one ?" interrupted Hast-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
" I may detain you an hour," replied Griswold.&#xD;
"Very well; one, or two, or the day if necessary ;"&#xD;
and seating himself at a table, he hastily penned a&#xD;
note to Mr. Blodgett postponing the consultation for&#xD;
he day, nd requesting him to remain at the store-&#xD;
ready for service if he should want him.&#xD;
thing that affects the firm, but somethus&#xD;
&#xD;
which affects my friend, detains me," was the con-&#xD;
eluding passage of his note.&#xD;
It was nearly noon when Mr. Blodgett received a&#xD;
second note from Hastings, requesting both him and&#xD;
Mr. Johnston to call at N4. -Wall street. In half&#xD;
an hour both gentlemen were seated in Griswold's&#xD;
law office.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," began Hastings, "my conduct this&#xD;
morning requires some little explanation. About&#xD;
three years since, I came to New York to seek my&#xD;
fortune. Thomas F. Griswold, the gentleman to&#xD;
whom I have just introduced you, took me by the&#xD;
hand, and, through Mr. Edgemonte, obtained for me&#xD;
a situation as clerk with Blodgett, John 1aon &amp;amp; Co.&#xD;
This same Thomas F. Griswold guided all my efforts&#xD;
while a clerk in that house. Every day he added&#xD;
some new and valuable acquaintance to my list. In&#xD;
fact, he has made me what I am. You will both ac-.&#xD;

Hastings &amp;amp; Co.' have been satisfactory since m, con-.&#xD;

difficulty. His father has made an assignment: For&#xD;
the want of a temporary loan, Mr. Griswold must go&#xD;
entirely to the wall. If his son can borrow for that&#xD;
period, he will save his father's property. Advance&#xD;
this money, and take my share in the profits of the&#xD;
firm as your security until the loan is refunded. I&#xD;
know that either one of you can do it in twenty four&#xD;
hours, and not feel it."&#xD;
Hastings went on for some time explaining the&#xD;
whole failure'&#xD;

seen all the breakers, there is my check for enough&#xD;
to rebuild the house. Mr. Thomas F. Griswold can pay&#xD;
it back to me when he likes; and Mr.. William Hast-&#xD;
ings may continue to draw his profits as usual from&#xD;
Blodgett, Johnston, Hastings &amp;amp; Co.'s funds. I must&#xD;
go, gentlemen. Blodgett, if you can't raise your&#xD;
part, I'll try and lend it to you. Good afternoon,&#xD;
for I'm getting hungry." And he left the office.&#xD;
"ha! tha !" and Mr. Blodgett laughed quite im-&#xD;
moderately for such an old gentleman. Then, put-&#xD;
ting on his spectacles, replacing them two or three&#xD;
times.to get them into proper position, looking over&#xD;
them as many times at Griswold, scratching his head,&#xD;
first on one side and then on the other, at last he&#xD;
took up a pen and made a long calculation. He&#xD;
then wrote out in full, upon -a piece of law paper, a&#xD;
cheek. Handing it to Hastings, he said: "There ;&#xD;
don't present that at the bank for two days. Those&#xD;
bank men will think I've gone crazy. It is only&#xD;
yesterday I deposited, and told them I didn't want&#xD;
to use my funds for a month, unless something&#xD;
turned up." -&#xD;
t "IBut this sum is more than is necessary," said&#xD;
Griswold, who had by this time received the check&#xD;
from Hastings and read it.&#xD;
"That's to pay the indorsements of your father.&#xD;
H&amp;amp; thinks more of them, young man, than he does.&#xD;
he house, ships, stock, and all. And now, seeing&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORflE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I've made such a- fool of myself, I've got a short&#xD;
story to tell.&#xD;
"In 18-, just thirty- two years ago, I was cramped&#xD;
for twenty thousand dollars. I lost nearly forty thou-&#xD;
sand in one year. Well, Jim Griswold was the man&#xD;
who indorsed all my paper, and helped me through.&#xD;
He's forgotten that, for he always was a man to for-&#xD;
get such an act of kindness. You needn't tell him&#xD;
anything about having old David Blodgett's check&#xD;
now. You'd better find out if it goes at the bank.&#xD;
William, go and call a carriage."&#xD;
- "No, I will send," interposed Griswold. "James"&#xD;
said he, calling his errand boy, "go and call a car-&#xD;
riage immediately."&#xD;
One week subsequent to this event, Thomas Gris-&#xD;
wold entered his father's room, at the New York Ho-&#xD;
tel, where they had'taken temporary quarters.&#xD;
"There, father, is a little package that may inte-&#xD;
rest you," said he.&#xD;
Mr. Griswold laid down an old and well-thumbed&#xD;
copy of the Holy Scriptures, carefully placing a mark&#xD;
in the page he was reading.&#xD;
"What is it, Thomas ?"&#xD;
"Examine for yourself, sir, if you please."&#xD;
"Notes ! Gordon's notes ! -IMy name, as indorser,&#xD;
cancelled. suit discontinued! certificates of New&#xD;
York Catfish Railroad Company. Contract! know&#xD;
all men by these presents-between James H. Gris-&#xD;
wold, of the first part, and John Vanderhuyden, mas-&#xD;
ter builder, of the second part. - What is all this,&#xD;
Thomas T"&#xD;
It means that you are on your feet once more.&#xD;
That's all. iPretty gogd week's work. Is it not,&#xD;

"Week's work! what do you mean, my son?"&#xD;
"Why, once upon a time, I did a little favor for a&#xD;
friend nineteen years of age.  That. boy is now.&#xD;
twenty-three years of age, and through his influence,&#xD;
Mr. David Blodgett, and Mr. Jacob H. Johnston, his&#xD;
partner, have loaned me, for one year, enough to ac-&#xD;
complish it all. They will help you further if you need&#xD;
more. I thought I might as well do up all the busi-&#xD;
ness, and saVe you the toil," and Thomas's eyes grew&#xD;
moist again in spite of himself.&#xD;
"Well, well," said his father, wiping away a tear ;&#xD;
"and there are four papers for you to copy. I shall&#xD;
be here at seven o'clock this evening."&#xD;
Some further explanations took place, when Mr.&#xD;
Griswold, taking his hat, left the hotel, and proceed-&#xD;
ed up Broadway.&#xD;
"'What a boy !-put me on my feet !-what a boy !&#xD;
He. shall have Clara now. .He has earned her. That&#xD;
rascal, James Mordaunt, shall be foiled. His plans&#xD;
are deep; but justice shall reach him.  Messrs.&#xD;
Wright, and Pierce say they are satisfied Mordaunt&#xD;
was :at the bottom of the depression. My eyes are&#xD;
not yet entirely opened, for I cannot fathom the mo-&#xD;
tive which has prompted Mordaunt to ruin me.&#xD;
Edgemonte says he is at the bottom of it all. Edge-&#xD;
monte may be mistaken."&#xD;
He had arrived at Mr. Edgemonte's residence, and&#xD;
rang the bell.&#xD;
"Is Miss Edgemonte at home ?"&#xD;
"She is, Mr. Griswold," replied the servant.&#xD;
"Give her my name and compliments, if you&#xD;
please; I wish to see her."&#xD;
Clara came running down stairs so rapidly, that.&#xD;
Mr. Griswold feared she would fall. Upon entering&#xD;
&#xD;
the parlor, she threw her arms around his neck, and&#xD;
affectionately kissed him. He fondly gazed at the&#xD;
lovely girl, proud indeed, that the time was now not&#xD;
distant when he might call her "Daughter."&#xD;
"Clara, Thomas would scold me if he knew what&#xD;
I was about. Go call your father. He must be pre-&#xD;
sent at our interview."&#xD;
Clara ran for her father. When Mr. Edgemonte&#xD;
entered the room, Mr. Griswold was busy untying a&#xD;
package.of papers.&#xD;
"There, Mr. Edgemonte, look over that bundle,&#xD;
and wonder as I did," said Mr. Griswold.&#xD;
"Mr. Edgemonte did Wonder somewhat; but not&#xD;
quite equal to Mr. Griswold's expectations. He for-&#xD;
got entirely that Thomas's part in the drama had yet&#xD;
to be enacted over by himself.&#xD;
"That's all good. 'Puts you on your feet again?"&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
Clara's eyes grew sparkling.&#xD;
" How has this been done ?"&#xD;
"Thomas has borrowed enough to arrange it all,&#xD;
for one year, on his simple notes, and about one hour&#xD;
since he handed these papers to me."&#xD;
".Thomas Griswold borrow on his simple notes?&#xD;
When did he do it ?" said MrEdgemonte, with un-&#xD;
feigned astonishment.&#xD;
"The day after I made my assignment. He did it&#xD;
all without my knowledge ; and, but half an hour&#xD;
since, handed me all these papers. Now I go into&#xD;
business again."&#xD;
"And I am the silent partner in the new firm,"&#xD;
said Mr. Edgemonte.&#xD;
"Then it shall be James H. Griswold &amp;amp; Co.,"'&#xD;

"Certainly not," replied Mr. Edgemonte. "fWe&#xD;
shall have to establish another concern altogether in&#xD;
order -to make you a partner. I think now, however,&#xD;

XXVI.-&#xD;
New York City Corporation Counsel-All Marriage INotiees not&#xD;
agreeable.&#xD;
ABOUT three weeks after the incidents occurred&#xD;
with which the last chapter concludes, James Mdr-&#xD;
daunt was spending an evening with his aunt at her&#xD;
residence. He had returned to New York from a&#xD;
visit at Aurora.&#xD;
"Now, James," said his aunt, "sit down and tell&#xD;
me, the news. You know I am not posted in any-&#xD;
thing which has happened since I left Aurora."&#xD;
"Mr. Mortimer has at last drawn from Bell, or&#xD;
rather from her brother, Frederick Mortimer, the&#xD;
real motive which causes her to refuse me."&#xD;
"Go on, James, it grows interesting. George&#xD;
Melville "&#xD;
"No, aunt, George Melville has nothing to do&#xD;
with it. A girl in Brooklyn, whom you will remem-&#xD;
ber, named Mary Wilcox, having had a daughter by&#xD;
somebody, has commenced a suit against me, alleging&#xD;
that I am her husband; that I assumed the name of&#xD;
Sanders, that one Rev. John Furnace married- us,&#xD;
that I was disguised as a sailor. Those are the prin-&#xD;
cipal facts alleged in the complaint. Frederick gave&#xD;
all the particulars to his father, and asked 1im if he&#xD;
had not better learn the truth of :this story against&#xD;

me before he insisted too strongly upon his daugh-&#xD;
ter's marrying against her will."&#xD;
"Mr. Mortimer asked you about them. What was&#xD;
your reply ?" said his aunt.&#xD;
"I satisfied him that the hole story was got up by&#xD;
Mary Wilcox's uncle to e tort money from me."&#xD;
"Did you ask Mr. Mortimer who was Frederick's&#xD;
informant ?" said Mrs. Tryon.&#xD;
Yes."&#xD;
"It was "-&#xD;
"Thomas Griswold," interrupted Mordaunt. "Fre-&#xD;
derick had the whole story in a letter written by&#xD;
Griswold off the second day after his father made an&#xD;
assignment."&#xD;
"Griswold, then, suspects your agency in the&#xD;
stock operation. How much did you make out of&#xD;
that ?"&#xD;
" Twenty-seven thousand dollars."&#xD;
"iVery. good!  I do not see as you have lost&#xD;
any advantage. You are that handsome sum ahead,&#xD;
and as fair a field as you had three years since to win&#xD;
the race- yet. What will you do with Mr. Thomas&#xD;
F. Griswold, for, his meddling? I understand he is&#xD;
a newly fledged lawyer."&#xD;
"Yes, and a growing one, too," replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
"He was appointed to 'the responsible position of&#xD;
_Corporation Counsel' last week.  William Hast-&#xD;
ings, a junior partner of 'Blodgett, Johnston, Hast-&#xD;
ings &amp;amp; Co.,' was the wire-puller who secured it to&#xD;
Griswold. Considerable objection was made ,to his&#xD;
youth; but his abilities as a lawyer are known to be&#xD;
fair, and almost any amount of sympathy was&#xD;
aroused among the heavy merchants on account of&#xD;
his father's failure. There was searcelya merchant&#xD;
&#xD;
in New Y ork of any respectability who could be got&#xD;
to oppose the appointment. They said Griswold had&#xD;
failed as an honest man should fail, and many not&#xD;
only signed. Hastings's petition to the .Common&#xD;
Council, but went personally and used their-influence&#xD;
with members of the board."&#xD;
" All that is very interesting, but what are you&#xD;
going to do with young Griswold ?"&#xD;
" I do not know," said Mordaunt, assuming a&#xD;
thoughtful mien. "I shall wait and watch."&#xD;
"Meanwhile the birds will mate vi et armis,,and&#xD;
without the usual ceremony of a wedding at home.&#xD;
No! no ! James, you must be up and doing."&#xD;
" What do you propose, my dear aunt ?" said&#xD;
Mordaunt.&#xD;
"If you can do nothing better, try the young&#xD;
lawyer as a criminal," said Mrs. Tryon.&#xD;
" As a criminal!?" said Mordaunt, with surprise.&#xD;
"Yes. Some one disguised to personate Thomas&#xD;
F. Griswold might present a forged check at one of&#xD;
the banks in Wall street, for instance."&#xD;
" Ttat is a difficult game; but it might be done by&#xD;
careful study. It would be necessary to deceive the&#xD;
officers of the bank perfectly; and it would require&#xD;
to be done when Griswold could not prove an alibi.&#xD;
I'll think it'over."&#xD;
"You might accomplish this, it seems to me, as&#xD;
well as you enacted the young sailor."&#xD;
"Oh! but I was younger then," said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Yes, and that is why I overlooked the affair. 1&#xD;
regarded it, you know, as your wildest bushel of&#xD;
oats. But I really hope they are not going to sprout&#xD;
'Iow.e&#xD;

Mordant from a deep reverie.&#xD;

Sarah E. Graham's call at Mordaunt's Law Office-A cool Scene-&#xD;
James Mordaunt in trouble.&#xD;
ON the day subsequent to his evening's interview&#xD;
with Mrs. Tryon, Mordaunt went early to his office.&#xD;
His partners were both absent from the city. He&#xD;
had been seated but a few moments, when a female,&#xD;
apparently about twenty-two or three years of&#xD;
age entered. She removed a thick veil and took&#xD;
the seat which Mordaunt offered. Her countenance&#xD;
had not yet lost its traces of beauty.  But suffering,&#xD;
remorse and despair, were doing their fatal work!&#xD;
"It is now some weeks since we have met,&#xD;
James."&#xD;
"You keep the run of time better than I, Sarah."&#xD;
" My race is almost run, James. I have-no one to&#xD;
blame for my sins but myself. It is true you taught&#xD;
me to love and took advantage of my affections ; but,&#xD;
had I listened to a mother's voice, I should have&#xD;
resisted. I have not come, however, to upbraid&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"iDo you wish more money ?"&#xD;
"No! I have done using the wages of sin, and&#xD;
.have come to perform a duty to another of your&#xD;
victimS."1&#xD;
"What mean you, SarahI " said Mordaunt,&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;

"Mary Wilcox, alias Mary Sanders, alias Mary&#xD;
Mordaunt, is your lawful wife.  You must own&#xD;
her to the world-    Stop sir ! Don't dare lock&#xD;
that door! As sure as you are now a living man, you&#xD;
shall be a dead one the moment you turn the key,"&#xD;
and Sarah very coolly played with the handle of a&#xD;
small revolver which she pointed towards Mordaunt,&#xD;
who had arisen for the purpose of locking 'the. door.&#xD;
"Sarah! put up that weapon. Who has taught&#xD;
you the use of such an instrument ?"&#xD;
"The man who took me from my home, and taught&#xD;
me to drink the cup of sin. He placed me where&#xD;
such little friends are necessary. I can hit any but-&#xD;
ton one your coat. Name one, James. Put up a&#xD;
penny! come! you shall see I do not boast. You&#xD;
wont,lock the door, will you? ,You are very kind.&#xD;
But, as I was saying when you interrupted me-&#xD;
Mary Sanders is your lawful wife. You must own&#xD;
her to the world, give her a support, and acknowledge&#xD;
your beautiful little daughter. Perhaps God will&#xD;
hear some prayers in my behalf if I make you do&#xD;
;justice to that one of His little ones."'&#xD;
"Why! Sarah Grahani! what evil spirit has taken&#xD;
possession of you ?" asked Mordaunt. "'Why should&#xD;
you become a demon to annoy and persecute me?"&#xD;
"Perhaps I am jealous, James. You remember&#xD;
your last words, when I first yielded to the oily tongue&#xD;
and skillful actor, were: 'Sarah, it is my love, my'&#xD;
unchangeable love which impels me to this act.' You&#xD;
see, have remembered them exactly. Is the 'green-&#xD;
eyed .e' a demon, James $?"&#xD;
"Pshaw! Sarah, you are not jealous. Why did'"&#xD;
1ohelp me get up the plan of a mock marriage&#xD;
ith Mary Wilcox, if jealousy troubled you ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mock marriage! Oh,no! Have never arranged&#xD;
any mock marriages, except in my own case. There&#xD;
was some mockery, it is true, when I married you.&#xD;
We then made a mockery of what I once learned to&#xD;
say over at Sabbath-school, when an innocent little&#xD;
girl. Perhaps you can repeat the seventh command-&#xD;
ment, James ?"&#xD;
"Sarah Graham, what lave you come here for ?"&#xD;
said Mordaunt, very much alarmed at the cool man-&#xD;
ner assumed by his strange client.&#xD;
"You will promise then, James, to acknowledge&#xD;
your marriage with-Mary Wilcox."&#xD;
"Woman-you are crazy ! If that "&#xD;
"Perhaps Iam," interrupted Sarah  "Mary Wil-&#xD;
cox will be soon, you know-     She has grown&#xD;
pale and thin. I do not think it would be possible&#xD;
for you to visit her without having sympathies excit-&#xD;
ed in her behalf."&#xD;
"Sympathies ! Sarah. If that is all you have- to&#xD;
say to me, the sooner you leave, the better."&#xD;
"Very well! it was a long way down to your.&#xD;
office, but, I am suffciently rested. I may as well&#xD;
bid you good morning. You know I live at No. -&#xD;
Twenty-third street."&#xD;
"Yes ! I shall have no desire to see you again on&#xD;
this subject."&#xD;
Sarah Graham left Mordaunt's office.  As she&#xD;
descended to the ground floor of the building, she&#xD;
noticed that one of the lower rooms was' vacant.&#xD;
The door being open, she entered it for the Purpose&#xD;
of arranging her dress. Her habits of life for several&#xD;
years had taught her to know nothing of fear. The&#xD;
blinds were closed. On the south sideof the rbon&#xD;
was a large closet. Within it, at the west end, was&#xD;
&#xD;
. '       'GE-QRG}E MELYILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7805-00000093"/>&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
a board partition. Sarah heard some-foot-steps, evi-&#xD;
* dently descending from Mordaunt's office. Noticing&#xD;
the closet, and not desiring to be seen in the vacant&#xD;
room,'she entered it and stood eagerly watching for&#xD;
the person, or persons, to pass out of the hall&#xD;
door, of which, from her position, she had a full&#xD;
view.&#xD;
Instead of seeing any one pass out of the door, as,&#xD;
she expected, a rough-looking man, with a small&#xD;
head, black hair, black eye, and short in stature,&#xD;
entered the hall from the court. At the same moment&#xD;
Mordaunt's form appeared within Sarah's range of&#xD;
vision.&#xD;
" Ah I Good morning, Mr. Shank ;" said Mor-&#xD;
daunt.&#xD;
"Good morning, squire !" returned Shank, with,&#xD;
an-effort to accomplish a polite bow, touching his&#xD;
hat and calling up, what he determined should prove&#xD;
to be a smile of respect, but which ended in an&#xD;
affectionate patronizing leer.&#xD;
Mordaunt's self-love and prides were ill controlled&#xD;
to brook the patronizing airs of the man -before him;&#xD;
but, at that moment, the word "Fear," was impressed&#xD;
in large characters upon his mind's eye, quickening&#xD;
both his natural and acquired power of dissimulation&#xD;
-Bob Shank consequently discovered no traces of&#xD;
the pride which would have spurned his contact.&#xD;
Again, Mordaunt knew that he had work for the&#xD;
villain to execute..&#xD;
" Iam in some haste, Mr. Shank ; but, if you have&#xD;
anything of importance, I will try to devote a little&#xD;
time to you," said Mordaunt..&#xD;
"I've only few words, to say, as yit. Thim, how-&#xD;
s'ever; is of some consequince."&#xD;
&#xD;
tI&#xD;
&#xD;
182&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
"Step into this room, Mr. Shank. We shall be&#xD;
entirely alone here," said Mordaunt.&#xD;
Sarah Graham had crouched herself in the darkest&#xD;
corner of the closet, behind the partition. Thus far&#xD;
she had heard all of the conversation which had&#xD;
passed between Mordaunt and Shank. It was not&#xD;
her desire to play the eaves-dropper; but, she did&#xD;
not care to be discovered in the room. -&#xD;
"Now, Mr. Shank, let me hear from you. We are&#xD;
alone here."&#xD;
"Let me 'xamine the quarters first. Walls, some-&#xD;
times hev ears, you know."&#xD;
Shank made a survey of the room. At last he ap-&#xD;
proached the closet. Sarah Graham's heart beat a&#xD;
little faster; but she determined to put a bold face&#xD;
on the matter, if discovered. It was fortunate, if in-&#xD;
deed a discovery was of any great consequence to&#xD;
her, that Shank was not very minute in his examina-&#xD;
tion of the closet. He opened the door, walked into'&#xD;
it ; ran his hand to some extent along the wall, and&#xD;
pronounced all right. His search seemed to be&#xD;
prompted rather by habits of caution than any real&#xD;
fear of listeners.&#xD;
"It's all right; but one had better know about&#xD;
these matters, squire," said Shank.&#xD;
"Certainly, certainly" replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
Oftentimes the most skillful plans for evil are&#xD;
thwarted by as simple apparent means as the dis-&#xD;
arrangement of a woman's costume. Who- shall&#xD;
make the great world of mind believe that He who&#xD;
lets not  a sparrow fall on the ground without&#xD;
Him, is not the master builder of' every counterplot&#xD;
for the right ? But go on, James Mordaunt ! Hope,&#xD;

"Sarah Graham! What folly has aroused her to&#xD;
cross my path.?  I have always treated her well.&#xD;
On my means she has lived in ease and indepen-&#xD;
dence for eight years. Thus far I have allowed her&#xD;
to make her own bed, and she has chosen it soft and,&#xD;
luxurious. Let her beware ! If I must become her&#xD;
lady's maid, the. counterpane which the 'Iight of the&#xD;
harem' might have envied, 'shall be changed for a&#xD;
winding-sheet."'&#xD;
Such were some of the thoughts which occupied&#xD;
James Mordaunt, as he rode in an omnibus to his&#xD;
aunt's residence, that day, at the conclusion of&#xD;
business hours.  This was not the conclusion of&#xD;
ki3 business, however. Having finished the usual&#xD;
evening meal, he retired to his room. The hour was&#xD;
too early for his purpose.  Lighting a cigar, he&#xD;
seated himself in a large arm-chair, the soft velvet&#xD;
cushion of which, so suggestive of quiet and repose,&#xD;
accorded but ill with the terrible thoughts which&#xD;
made the red stream of life to course quickly in his&#xD;
system.&#xD;
"This condition is not to the purpose," said Mor-&#xD;
daunt. "Sarah Graham should never have awakened&#xD;
sndia throbbing in my veins. It is the same blood&#xD;
hichahas coursed, even more swiftly, under the,&#xD;
gentle touch of her rosy-Tips. Ha! that mirror&#xD;

Wilcox's favor? Nine o'clock I" Mordaunt aroSe.&#xD;
"Good bye, my dear aunt; I must out tg-night."&#xD;
" Not to-mrorrow night again, sir. We go to Mrs.&#xD;
McDonough's party, you will remember."&#xD;
"Certainly," said Mordaiunt, as he left his aunt's&#xD;
residence. He took his way to a small but handsome&#xD;
house in Twenty-third street. Having arrived, he&#xD;
rang the bell. There was no response. He pulled&#xD;
again. Still no response.&#xD;
"The lady who lives there, shure," said a servant&#xD;
girl, standing at the gate of the next house, "left&#xD;
this afthernoon, and ain't in at all."&#xD;
" Why did you notice her so particularly?" asked&#xD;
Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Bekase, sure, she tuk away sax thrunks, and a&#xD;
sight o' boxes and band-boxes. She's gone to some&#xD;
o' the watherin' places, they said."&#xD;
" Who said, my good woman ?" asked Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Biddy Burns, her girl, that wint with her;&#xD;
shure."&#xD;
"Did she say when her mistress would return?"&#xD;
asked Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. Biddy Burns said they was goin' to be&#xD;
afther livin' in another place, and wasn't coming' back&#xD;
at all."&#xD;
Mordaunt waited to hear no more. He walked&#xD;
away from the house. In about an hour he retui-ned.&#xD;
This time his approach was made with care, lest he&#xD;
should be- observed. Having gained the front en-&#xD;
trance, he took a key from his pocket, and opened&#xD;
they door. Striking a light, he looked into the par-&#xD;

A deep oath was the first effect which the perusal&#xD;
of Sarah Graham's note produced. The second was&#xD;
to fill Mordaunt's mind with terrible forebodings, and&#xD;
his frame with the tremor of ungovernable fear. Be&#xD;
threw himself upon the bed, and devoted himself&#xD;
to the solution of that problem ever most difficult to&#xD;

Doubtless you will seek for me some evening, as usual. You&#xD;

have concluded to do justice to Mary Mordaunt and your beautiful&#xD;

lore. Everything was as usual. He then ascended&#xD;
to the second story. Entering the front apartment,&#xD;
he lighted a gas-burner. .The room was in perfect&#xD;
order, and most elegantly furnished. James Mor-&#xD;
daunt Was troubled. For the first time in his life, he&#xD;
began to regret. His reflections were not the off-&#xD;
spring of repentance. As he looked into his soul, he&#xD;
acknowledged to himself that in Sarah Graham he had&#xD;
one to deal with who knew him thoroughly; and he knew&#xD;
she could ruin him. Fear, then, caused his regret.&#xD;
"Who has prompted Sarah Graham to this&#xD;
course ?" he said aloud.&#xD;
The question was answered, but not then ; the rich&#xD;
furniture and pictured walls which heard it, but a few&#xD;
Hours before had listened to the bitter anguish of Sarah&#xD;
Graham, gazing upon the hideous visions-of her wick-&#xD;
edness, with sight rendered keen by the angel of re-&#xD;
pentance. As yet that beautiful angel had only ho-&#xD;
vered in her presence, whispering with the "still small&#xD;
voice," "Daughter, there is peace even for thee."&#xD;
As ]ordaunt went towards a dressing-bureau, for&#xD;
the purpose of examining to see if Sarah had taken&#xD;
her wardrobe, his eye fell upon a small note, bearing&#xD;
his name on the outside in her hand-writing.&#xD;
Hastily breaking the seal, he read the following:&#xD;

"Good morning, Mr. Fellows," said the police&#xD;

(Signed,) JONATHAN B., FELLOWS..&#xD;
&#xD;
Before me,&#xD;
J. B. BROWNSON, Justice of the Peace,&#xD;
in and for the county of O&#xD;
Upon this affidavit, Justice Brownson issued his&#xD;
warrant against the body of George Melville. It&#xD;
was given to an officer, with directions to arrest&#xD;
Melville wherever he might be found.&#xD;
"The young rascal has about forty hours the start&#xD;
of you," said the justice to the constable ; "but with&#xD;
due diligence you can overtake him. Telegraph dis-&#xD;
patches have been sent to every city on the line.&#xD;
Don't show him any favor because he has played up&#xD;
' big gentleman."'&#xD;
With these instructions the officer started. At the&#xD;
village of Cayuga, he obtained the first clue of Mel-&#xD;
ville. He there learned that a person answering the&#xD;
officer's description had taken the steamboat the day&#xD;
before. His informant was so certain in the matter&#xD;
that the officer determined to follow. On board the&#xD;
$ti nrboat his information was confirmed, and le&#xD;

&#xD;
also learned that Melville had left the boat at Au.&#xD;
rora. We will leave the officer of justice to make,&#xD;
his trip to Aurora, while the reader becomes ac-&#xD;
quainted with some of George Melville's movements.&#xD;
Two years subsequent to Ms graduation from col-&#xD;
lege, George Melville received a diploma as Doctor&#xD;
of Medicine from the Medical College in Berk-&#xD;
shire County Massachusetts. His father had desired&#xD;
that he should have the benefit of a year devoted to&#xD;
study in Europe. For this purpose, George made a&#xD;
visit to Paris and remained nearly that time. He&#xD;
had just returned from Europe, at the time James&#xD;
Mordaunt met him in the cars at Auburn, in com-&#xD;
pany with his sister, cousin, and Thomas Griswold,&#xD;
During the visit at Aurora which followed, he had&#xD;
asked Bell Mortimer's hand of her parents. The re-&#xD;
quest had been refused.  Mr. Mortimer had informed&#xD;
Melville that his connection with his family would&#xD;
not be acceptable. George and Bell had parted with&#xD;
mutual promises to wait until every difficulty could&#xD;
be removed. George pledged his heart and hand&#xD;
to Bell-Bell had accepted the trust and given a&#xD;
pledge equally sacred.&#xD;
Melville now made Thomas Griswold his confidant.&#xD;
Clara Edgemonte had already possessed Belt's secret,&#xD;
and Bell had learned from Clara the history of Marys&#xD;
Wilcox. Clara, acting under the former advice of&#xD;
her father, had counselled Bell to make no mention&#xD;
of the affair until further developments. Thomas&#xD;
Griswold's letter to Frederick Mortimer, written sub-&#xD;
sequent to the failup&amp;amp;f Mr. Griswold, had produced&#xD;
its effect upon Bell's father. Frederick, under Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer's directions, had visited New York. His&#xD;
&#xD;
visit had been entirely unknown to Mordaunt. He&#xD;
had made his inquiries first of Mr. Taylor, Mary&#xD;
Wilcox's counsel, and then of Mary wilcox herself.&#xD;
Clara Edgemonte had given him the history of her&#xD;
first meeting with Mary Wilcox. Mr. Taylor showed&#xD;
him a written statement, signed by John Furnace,&#xD;
clergyman, and verified by his affidavit,. to the effect&#xD;
that he had performed the marriage ceremony for&#xD;
a young sailor, calling himself Henry Sanders, and&#xD;
Mary Wilcox; that in James Mordaunt he had recog-&#xD;
nized the person who personated the, young sailor;&#xD;
that he was the more certain in this particular from&#xD;
the fact that he had noticed two moles on the back&#xD;
of the young-sailor's neck, which made an impression&#xD;
upon him at the time of the marriage ; that James&#xD;
Mordaunt had two moles upon him precisely similar&#xD;
in size, shape, and position; that, at Mr. Taylor's re-&#xD;
quest, lie had watched the said Mordaunt in the&#xD;
street, until he had obtained a fair and full view of&#xD;
the said moles. In addition to this testimony, Mr.&#xD;
Taylor handed, for Frederick's perusal, the following&#xD;
note, traced in a beautiful but peculiar hand-writing,&#xD;
evidently that of a-female:&#xD;
&#xD;

SIR:&#xD;

T. S. Taylor, esq.&#xD;
&#xD;
I have learned that you are in search of evidence to establish&#xD;
the claims which Mary Wilcox and her daughter have upon James&#xD;
Mordaunt, as a husband and father. Pursue your course steadily and&#xD;
patiently. The claims are valid. She was married to James Mor-&#xD;
daunt under the assumed name of Henry Sanders. He was disguised&#xD;
as a sailor. The= ceremony was performed on the --  day of-,&#xD;
t8-., at 10 o'clock, P.m.  Of that ceremony I was an unbidden&#xD;
witness. The place where the marriage was celebrated I shall keep&#xD;
secret, because it is unnecessary as a link in the evidence, and would&#xD;

enable you to discover me-; but, that you may at once place cont.-.&#xD;
deunce in this note, although it bears only my initials, and is therefore&#xD;
anonymous, I will give you the name and residence of the clergyman&#xD;
who officiated. Ifis Rev. John Furnace, now residing at No. ----&#xD;
Washington street, Brooklyn. There are reasons why I cannot' trust&#xD;
you with my full confidence. .Again I say, pursue-your course steadily&#xD;
and patiently. You shallnsucceed, even tough I have to appear as a&#xD;
witness in the ease. And finally, let these words be ever uppermost&#xD;
in your mind, cheering you on in the noble effort to give virtue its&#xD;
just reward, ".M death cannot avail James fordautt in his villainy,"&#xD;
S.E.G.&#xD;
That note seems conclusive, but I do not like the&#xD;
anonymous character which the writer has assumed,"&#xD;
said'Frederick. '&#xD;
"That, my young friend," replied         Mr. Taylor,&#xD;
under ordinary circumstances, would be my judg-&#xD;
ment; but in this instance, the mystery under which&#xD;
the author has shrouded herself, for I think the&#xD;
writer a female, gives to every sentence a double&#xD;
force."&#xD;
" How so? I cannot perceive it," said Frederick.&#xD;
"That note, Mr. Mortimer, I received on the       -&#xD;
d1ay/of."&#xD;
"That is the same 'day," interrupted Frederick,&#xD;
"James Mordauit' arrived with his aunt at Aurora.&#xD;
He   received a telegraphic dispatch      and left my&#xD;
father's house immediately, not even waiting to finish&#xD;
his dinner, although a plate had just been handed&#xD;
to bixp, filled with all the necessaries for a generous&#xD;
meal."'&#xD;
"That may become a significant fact, Mr. Mor-&#xD;
timer.   I will make a note of it."   Laying aside his&#xD;
pen, Mr. Taylor continued: "That note, Mr. Mor-&#xD;
tiiner, I"received on the -        day of  -.     Tp to&#xD;
&#xD;
that time, every effort to obtain testimony in favor&#xD;
of Mary Wilcox's story had proved abortive.&#xD;
That note has unravelled the web. It is true, Mr.&#xD;
Furnace has most mysteriously and suddenly dis-&#xD;
appeared, but we have his affidavit, which, in a&#xD;
reasonable time, will be allowed as testimony,&#xD;
even though we cannot prove the death of the&#xD;
deponent."&#xD;
" His death !" exclaimed Frederick.&#xD;
"I have some strange suspicions, Mr. Mortimer,&#xD;
but it is unnecessary to :give them words. If we&#xD;
could prove that John Furnace was deceased, his&#xD;
affidavit would at once assume a' grave importance.&#xD;
I have had some of the most skillful men in the&#xD;
police force of New York and Brooklyn engaged,&#xD;
secretly tracing Mr.' Furnace for the last month.&#xD;
Chief JIM-I seldom fails me, and his whole ener-&#xD;
gies are aroused in this matter. Nothing pleases&#xD;
him better than to see a wronged woman hold her&#xD;
own against a deep'villain."&#xD;
"May you prosper in this cause, Mr.'Taylor," said&#xD;
Frederick, shading .his eyes with his hand, and&#xD;
devoutly, but silently, thanking the Supreme Being&#xD;
for rescuing his beloved sister from the arms of a&#xD;
black-hearted scoundrel. , '" It- is such duty, sir,&#xD;
which elevates your profession far above every&#xD;
employment known among men. You attack Satan&#xD;
face to face-steel to steel-blood - for blood. Al1'&#xD;
heaven and hell witness the conflict ;" and Frederick&#xD;
Mortimer grasped Mr. Taylor's hand with the nervous&#xD;
energy of a man who felt what he uttered, and bade&#xD;
him good bye.&#xD;

forgotten some little keep-sake,or article of necessity.&#xD;
In that event,- he argued to himself:&#xD;
She will return to the house or send."&#xD;
Bob Shank's instructions were, to allow any one&#xD;
who might enter, to have free access into every&#xD;
part of the house. If Sarah herself came, he was to&#xD;
arrest her. If she sent, he was to follow her messen-&#xD;
ger. At six o'clock, Shank was at his post. He&#xD;
watched patiently all that day, but no one came.&#xD;
At night, 'he occasionally fell into a doze ; but the&#xD;
least noise would instantly awaken him. At about&#xD;
eleven o'clock, the noise of a key in the lock aroused&#xD;
him. He was in the front parlor, and instantly&#xD;
retired .by the back parlor to the hall, and so into&#xD;
the basement. The alarm, however, proceeded from&#xD;
Mordaunt himself. As soon as Mordaunt was inside&#xD;
the door, he called aloud to Shank.&#xD;
g "Oh, it's you, squire ! I thought I was about&#xD;
-to larn something we wanted to know." The two&#xD;
descended into the kitchen, leaving the doors open,&#xD;
in order to detect any noise.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Shank, I have matured my plan about&#xD;
that especial friend of yours, who treated you and&#xD;
your friend to a bullet a-piece about three years&#xD;
since. It is a long road which has no turning."&#xD;
Good!, And I haven't done with young Gris-&#xD;
wold yet," said Shank.&#xD;
That is as you choose, Mr. Shank," replied Mor-&#xD;
daunt. "My promise has been redeemed in his case,&#xD;
and now I have matured the plan for 1Velville. He&#xD;
is to-day stopping at the Astor House. I overheard&#xD;
a conversation between him and a friend, in which&#xD;
he said that he was going to the city of U-----.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
He has some business to attend to- for his father&#xD;
at that place, which, he said, would occupy a, fort-&#xD;
night. To-morrow, he takes the boat -for Albany.&#xD;
Now, instead of having Ggorge Melville present a&#xD;
forged check at a bank in this city, as I said yester-&#xD;
day, my plan is, that he shall do it at the city of&#xD;
U     . I have this afternoon pointed him out to&#xD;
Barstow, the tailor, who, you know, is one of the&#xD;
'Ever FaithfuL' Barstow has picked out Harding,&#xD;
who is. just Melville's height and size, and has the&#xD;
same colored hair, eyes, and whiskers, to present the&#xD;
check. Melville has got one very peculiar coat,&#xD;
which he wore to-day. Doubtless, he will wear that&#xD;
coat soon at U   . If he wears it but once, it will&#xD;
be enough to identify him. But, if the check can&#xD;
be presented the same day he wears the coat, and, if&#xD;
possible, when Melville is taking an afternoon nap,&#xD;
so as to prevent his proving an alibi; he can't escape&#xD;
a term in State Prison."&#xD;
"Well, squire, that plan beats any you've made&#xD;
yet. All I am to do is to aid Harding, and then on&#xD;
the trial I may swear to enough to fill up any extra&#xD;
links for the district attorney."&#xD;
That is a very good suggestion,",said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"I'll buy a draft just before the check is pre-&#xD;
sented," said Shank. " How about the check !"&#xD;
" There it is! 'Sherman, Hollett &amp;amp; Davis,' of&#xD;
the city of U-  , are our clients, and the signature&#xD;
to that check would deceive even Mr. Sherman him-&#xD;
self. No matter who wrote it."&#xD;
Of course not," said Shank. "What day must&#xD;
I start e"&#xD;
"Tuesday of next week."&#xD;

" Hark 1"' whispered Shaik.&#xD;
An unmistakable click, as of the insertion of a key&#xD;
into the lock of the front door, arrested their atten.&#xD;
tion. Both went instantly into the front basement.&#xD;
"There's a carriage in the middle of the road,"&#xD;
whispered Shank.&#xD;
Light footsteps were now heard ascending the&#xD;
hall stairs.&#xD;
"We must pin the girl, and then consult about the&#xD;
driver," whispered Shank.&#xD;
They softly ascended towards the front bed-room.&#xD;
As they reached the second story hail, the glimmer-&#xD;
ing light of a burning match cast its reflection&#xD;
through the door. Mordaunt first looked in and,&#xD;
recognized Sarah.  Shank instantly, but with the&#xD;
stealthy tread of/ a cat, entered the room. Mor-..&#xD;
daunt remained in the hall. When Shank entered,&#xD;
Sarah Graham touched the lighted match to a gas-&#xD;
burner. The bright light for an instant dazzled her&#xD;
eyes, and involuntarily she shaded them with her&#xD;
right hand. At this instant Shank seized her. His&#xD;
right hand he placed firmly over her mouth ; with,&#xD;
the left he roughly grasped her form; and the next&#xD;
moment she was lying with her back on' the floor, his&#xD;
right knee on her breast, his left knee pinioning her&#xD;
right arm, his left 'hand holding her left wrist, and&#xD;
his right hand still upon her mouth. She struggled&#xD;
but feebly; for had she possessed strength to resist an&#xD;
expected attack, now it was unavailable from fright.&#xD;
Mordaunt at this instant entered the room, and in a&#xD;
few moments Sarah Graham lay helpless upon: the&#xD;
floor, bound and gagged.&#xD;
"Lift her on the bed," said Mordaunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
This being done, the two fiends silently left the&#xD;
room. Descending .to the front parlor, they held a&#xD;
short consultation.&#xD;
" If nothing else will do," said Shank, "1'l make&#xD;
mince-meat of that driver. Is this a case of enough&#xD;
importance to run that risk ?"&#xD;
"Not if anything else can be done," said Mordaunt.&#xD;
" Then I will take care of him in my own way,"&#xD;
said Shank.&#xD;
Going to the street door, Shank accosted the driver&#xD;
with a rough, but intended-to-be-polite, "good even-&#xD;
ing, sir..&#xD;
"Good avening to yourself, sure," said the hack-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
Shank noticed that the moon was under a heavy&#xD;
cloud. Of course'the street lamps were not lighted.&#xD;
These facts induced him to alter his plan, which had&#xD;
been to take the life of the driver; then to place his&#xD;
body on the driver's seat and set the horses to run-&#xD;
ning. Shank was a desperado who knew no fear,&#xD;
and who held life cheaply. His hands reeked with&#xD;
the blood of many victims. He was satisfied that be-&#xD;
cause of tie darkness of the street, he could talk with&#xD;
the man and not be discovered. The darkness saved&#xD;
the man's life.&#xD;
"What on earth has brought Miss Sarah home at&#xD;
such an hour, I wonder?" said Shank, as he advanced&#xD;
into the middle of the street.&#xD;
" Faith and I couldn't be afther telling that same,"&#xD;
said the driver. "I met her in front ov the Astor&#xD;
Iouse, be the Park. Is she going down agin? -She&#xD;
towld me to wait 'till she cum out. Perhaps, shure,&#xD;
she's only gone in for the tin shillings."&#xD;

"I'll go and see if that's the case," said Shank.&#xD;
This conversation satisfied Shank that the driver was&#xD;
entirely ignorant of Sarah, or her purposes. Acting&#xD;
upon this judgment, he entered the house, and hav-&#xD;
ing waited a reasonable time, came out with the&#xD;
money.&#xD;
"Here's the money. The lady couldn't find her&#xD;
purse," said he.&#xD;
The hackman, on receiving his ten shillings, imme-&#xD;
diately drove off.&#xD;
"Is the door locked, Mr..Shank ?" said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"4All's right. You can talk to the girl now."&#xD;
Mordaunt immediately ascended to the room where&#xD;
Sarah Graham lay bound hand and foot. He care-&#xD;
fully examined her dress for any weapons which she&#xD;
might have about her person. With the exception&#xD;
of the small revolver which he had seen once before,&#xD;
she appeared to be unarmed. With his pocket-knife&#xD;
'e cut the thongs which bound her.&#xD;
Arising from the couch, at first she rubbed one of&#xD;
her :wrists; then, placing the folds of her dress again&#xD;
in order, she approached the'looking-glass. Having&#xD;
re-arranged her hair, she took up her hat, which bore&#xD;
the marks of the violence that had been done to her.&#xD;
Thia she proceeded to place again in shape. Mor&#xD;
daunt sat quietly upon the bed, uncertain how to&#xD;
deal yith her. She noticed that her bracelet was&#xD;
'not upon her arm. Looking around, she discovered&#xD;
t lying on the floor,",near Mordaunt's feet, and ad-&#xD;
vanced to pick it'up. Mordar.nt anticipated her&#xD;
design, and obtaining it, offered it to her. Sarah,&#xD;
taking it, clasped it upon her arm, and then, holding&#xD;
itupto 'the light, spoke:&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.               201&#xD;
" James, is it not beautiful ?"&#xD;
"I am glad you think so, Sarah," said Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Know, then, James, it was the gift of* a villain ;"&#xD;
and as she fixed her dark, flashing eye upon his&#xD;
with a gaze as steady as his own, her face exhibited&#xD;
feelings of the most intense scorn, with an occasional&#xD;
semblance of pity.&#xD;
""What mean you, Sarah?9 That was my gift to&#xD;
you," said Mordaunt, repressing the anger which her&#xD;
sudden and unexpected words had produced.&#xD;
"This is a pleasant room, James. Come, as I am&#xD;
weary, you must let me retire. As you have sent&#xD;
my carriage away, it is but right tbat I am permitted&#xD;
to enjoy your hospitality."&#xD;
"Sarah Graham, I will endure this farce no longer.&#xD;
Tell me why you have so suddenly become my&#xD;
enemy."&#xD;
" I have not become your enemy," replied 'Sarah&#xD;
" Instead of an enemy, I have become your gooA1&#xD;
angel. If you will take counsel from me, you will&#xD;
immediately establish Mary Wilcox and her daughter&#xD;
in their rights."&#xD;
"What is MaryWilcox to you, that you have thus&#xD;
suddenly become her champion ?"&#xD;
" She and her beautiful little daughter are'- the&#xD;
incense which I can offer up to expiate the oily&#xD;
crime I ever participated in, with the exception'of.&#xD;
prostituting my soul and body for your guilty plea-&#xD;
sures. When I stand for final judgment, their friend-&#xD;
ship will, perhaps, become my salvation, and their&#xD;
woes on earth will become your "&#xD;
" Damnation," said Mordaunt, supplying the word&#xD;
which Sarah, now unable to control her feelings, had&#xD;

left unspoken, but which, on Mordaunt's lip became&#xD;
a deep oath.&#xD;

tituted angel, your fancies are up. You can safely&#xD;
calcu1xte,;that :until I conclude what had better&#xD;
family be done with you, you will be placed where&#xD;
your tongue will injure none of your friends."&#xD;
"Villain! do your worst! I defy you to do more&#xD;
than procrastinate the hour of justice. Your deep-&#xD;
laid plot to murder Sarah Graham cannot now avail&#xD;
you. The blow which.pierces my heart will be too&#xD;
late. You should caution Mr. Shank to examine&#xD;
more thoroughly the closet in the -room under your&#xD;
law office, if you plot murder and forgery in such&#xD;
paces."&#xD;
Mordaunt could not endure this home expose of&#xD;
his villainy. Forgetting that his victim was a de-&#xD;
fonceless woman, and completely in his grasp; ;for-&#xD;
efting that the very woman he attacked, alone had&#xD;
it in her power to save his reputation; excited to&#xD;
frenzy by this complete exhibit of his plots, he&#xD;
prang from the bed, and seizing Sarah by the throat,&#xD;
even before she had time to utter more than a faint&#xD;
scream, hurled her, with all his force, against the&#xD;
rble mantel. A crushing sound, from the head&#xD;
ofthe once beautiful girl, was the result of this&#xD;
violation of his nanhood. The next moment, Mor-&#xD;
daunatod over the senseless form of Sarah Graham,&#xD;
Wrtain whether, to lis catalogue of sins he might&#xD;
add the crime of murder.&#xD;

An Arrest-A Promise made, and a Promise given.&#xD;
WE left an officer of justice pursuing George&#xD;
Melville to th6 village of Aurora, for the purpose-of&#xD;
arresting hin upon a warrant issued by a police&#xD;
justice on an affidavit made by one of the principal&#xD;
bankers in the city of U-, charging him with&#xD;
the high crime of forgery.    Upon arriving at&#xD;
Aurora, the officer proceeded at once to the Aurora&#xD;
House. He there learned, by casga1 inquiry, that&#xD;
George Melville was at Hou. 13. F. Mortigner's&#xD;
residence. Proceeding there at one, he rang the&#xD;
front doorbell  It was answered by the; colored&#xD;
woman, Bess.&#xD;
Is Mr. Mortixner at home ?" said the constable.&#xD;
"He is, sir ; will you walk in?"&#xD;
..Taking him into the library, she retired.&#xD;
Mortimer soon entered, and inquire&amp;amp;his business&#xD;
" Iam come, sir, upon n unpleasant duty Your&#xD;
name, sir, is not vnknown to Vie. My busins a&#xD;
one which, if executed in your house, will connect&#xD;
with it, if not odium, some unpleasant publicity."&#xD;
"You are very kind and considerate, sir; but I&#xD;
know of nothing which will warrant such fears or&#xD;
remarks," said fir. Mortimer.&#xD;

"I am aware of that,-and will proceed at once to.&#xD;
state my )Isiness. There is a warrant which directs&#xD;
me to arrest George Melville upon a charge of&#xD;
forgery," said he, handing Mr. Mortimer a paper.&#xD;
Mr. ' xortimer, as he received and perused the&#xD;
paper, was indeed surprised.&#xD;
"No," said he, "this must not be executed in my&#xD;
house, nor in -Aurora, if possible.".&#xD;
"You may rely, sir, upon my doing everything to&#xD;
allay the pain of this proceeding, consistent with my&#xD;
duty. - Ido not see how I can avoid making the&#xD;
arrest in Aurora."&#xD;
"I will order my horse and carriage, which. you&#xD;
can-appear in as driver. I will then request Melville&#xD;
to go to Auburn immediately for me on business.&#xD;
When in Auburn you can make the arrest, and keep.&#xD;
your own counsel in regard to how he got there,"&#xD;
said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Yery well, sir," replied the constable.&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer immediately ordered the horse and&#xD;
buggy, and then sat down to write a short note ;&#xD;
which, being finished, he handed to .the officer, re-&#xD;
questing him to give it to Melville as soon as the&#xD;
arrest was made.&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer's plan was carried out. Melville&#xD;
raised no objections to complying with Mr. Morti-&#xD;
mer s request. Upon arriving at Auburn, the officer&#xD;
'first handed to Melville Mr. Mortimer's note. He&#xD;
broke the seal, and read as follows:&#xD;
"7The person who hands you this is an officer from the. city Of&#xD;
TI'   12-le has just shown me a warrant commanding him to&#xD;
arrest you as a forger. Have preferred, and doubtless you'll&#xD;
&#xD;
readily perceive the propriety of my preference, that the service of&#xD;
this process should not take place in Aurora. If it is any satisfaction&#xD;
to you,-know that I am filled with the deepest sorrow by the occur-&#xD;
rence. Myself and Frederick will be in the city of U - to-night.&#xD;
"Yours very respectfully,&#xD;
"B. F. Mortimer.&#xD;
"THIR5DY, PM.&#xD;
As soon as Melville and the officer left his resi-&#xD;
dence, Mr. Mortimer sent a servant for his son Fre-&#xD;
derick.&#xD;
As Frederick entered his father's study, Mr. Mor-&#xD;
timer arose, and, placing his hands behind his back,&#xD;
a habit of long standing whenever he was greatly&#xD;
. perplexed, he thus addressed his son:&#xD;
"Well, Frederick, it turns out that James Mor-&#xD;
daunt, esquire, is not the only vilian who has&#xD;
sought your sister's hand."&#xD;
"Pray, father, what do you mean?" said Fre-&#xD;
derick; his face expressing the greatest astonishment&#xD;
at the remark.&#xD;
"You may well look surprised, sir; but I have&#xD;
performed, within the last fifteen minutes, the most&#xD;
disagreeable act, of my life."&#xD;
" Do explain yourself, father."&#xD;
"Very well!    I will do so by giving you an order&#xD;
which I wish you to obey to the letter. Pack your&#xD;
valise, take your horse, and go to Auburn instantly.&#xD;
Take the evening train for the East.   On board of it&#xD;
you will find George Melville in the hands of."a con-&#xD;
stable, arrested for the crime of forgery. Go to the&#xD;
city of U   -    and do what you can to make the&#xD;
world believe we did not think him       a villain too&#xD;
quickly, for the sake of appearances."&#xD;

"And Bell," said Frederick, "this will kill her-+&#xD;
I must see her."&#xD;
"N o! leave that business to me. I can humor all&#xD;
her whims a- well and better than you, now that my&#xD;
wishesrtare likely to prevail about this ,marriage."&#xD;
"James Mordaunt is at the bottom of this matter,&#xD;
sir ;" said Frederick. "George Melville is an inno-&#xD;
cent man. Money has no attraction for him. His&#xD;
father is reputed to be wealthy."&#xD;
"Reputed!"'said Mr. Mortimer. "You had best&#xD;
spare your judgment from error until the facts are&#xD;
before you."&#xD;
"Well, good bye, father. I will bring the facts&#xD;
from the city of U-   ."  Saying which, Frederick&#xD;
Mortimer left his home to join ]Welvlle.&#xD;
After his son had been absent a few moments, Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer rang his bell, which was always answered&#xD;
byBess.&#xD;
I am here, Mr. Mortimer," said Bess, after stand-&#xD;
ing several moments, holding the library door open.&#xD;
Mr. Nortimer started suddenly as Bess thus ad-&#xD;
dressed him.&#xD;
"I had forgotten ,that 1 rang the bell, Bess. 'Go&#xD;
and request Miss Mortimer to come to the library."&#xD;
"Yis sir," said Bess, her face and actions showing&#xD;
her profound regard for the present head of the Mor-&#xD;
tiuer family, in which she had been a servant from&#xD;
childhood.&#xD;
2aell IN ortinier soon entered the presence of her&#xD;
father. She was changed in some respects. The&#xD;

GEORGE MELVILLE.               2O  &#xD;
As she entered the room, her father gazed on his&#xD;
daughter with a pride measured only by ambition&#xD;
to see her crowned -with the laurels she was so emi-&#xD;
nently fitted to wear. George Melville he had read&#xD;
and studied with patience, zeal, and skill. He had&#xD;
arisen from the task, as does the student from a book&#xD;
of more pretension than merit. He saw that George&#xD;
Melville had the name of a scholar, but not the&#xD;
brain. While his early advantages made him   a&#xD;
perfect gentleman in the graces of the schools, his&#xD;
want of application, during a novitiate in the path-&#xD;
way of learning, had subdued, if indeed it had not&#xD;
entirely quenched, the fires of his genius. To Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer's; close perception of character, George&#xD;
Melville, as a student, was a mere youth, walking&#xD;
on stilts. He felt that the accidents of birth and&#xD;
fortune which 'propped him, might one' day be&#xD;
knocked fromunder his feet. His downfall, in that&#xD;
case easily predicted, 'would be the more lamentable&#xD;
in its results ; the higher the winds of good fortune&#xD;
should carry him, the greater the fall. The favorite&#xD;
comparison with which he eased his conscience for&#xD;
thwarting his daughter's love wgs--&#xD;
" Melville is a clever boy; but he is a balloon, and&#xD;
will rise as long as the gas lasts."&#xD;
In this judgment of Mr. Mortimer's we are obliged,&#xD;
for truth's sake, however painful the confession, to&#xD;
acknowledge that we coincide. But 'in another&#xD;
regard, Mr. Mortimr had been blind; he had failed&#xD;
to perceive the great practical genius of the young&#xD;
man. Thay principle of character which' has led&#xD;
thankind out Of the savage wilds, has built the rpyras&#xD;

and wept over the dead body of Brutus; placed in&#xD;
the hands of the astronomer the ladder with which&#xD;
he has mounted the heavens; given to the mariner&#xD;

let contending principles cause the -mighty pulse&#xD;
of American Freedom to quicken, thereby purify-&#xD;
ing the body of disease; but, remember, ye of&#xD;
North, South, East, and West, this homely truth:&#xD;
"Dum igitur ventri cibum subducunt, corpus debilitatur, et&#xD;
membra ser invidim sum poenituit." *&#xD;
George Melville, thus far in his life, with this&#xD;
exception, was all that the distinguished statesman&#xD;
had read him. He was no more fitted by taste, habit,&#xD;
or dicipline, to adorn the medical profession, than an&#xD;
"ass to honor a lion's skin."    This, E-sopic simile&#xD;
may become a feast for the critics, but if it serves to&#xD;
urads1 out the ruins of any air-castles which our gene-&#xD;
rous and lenient readers have built for George Mel-&#xD;
ville, we shall not regret that it had become our&#xD;
emplog. Providence, by one of His wonderful and&#xD;
inscrutable decrees, was yet to prepare Melville for&#xD;
usefulness and greatness.  College had put:forth her&#xD;
bes efforts for George Melville, but his Alma Mater,&#xD;
* "WPhile, therefore, the members withheld food from the belly,&#xD;
the bds was enfeebled, and the members wien too late; repented of&#xD;
their hatrd."&#xD;
&#xD;
notwithstanding her mountain of labor, had brought&#xD;
forth a-mouse. Again, we must not anticipate.&#xD;
"Bell, sit by me," said Mr. Mortimer, using his&#xD;
most affectionate tone ; "I have something to. say&#xD;
which must give you even more pain than my settled&#xD;
antipathy to your union with George Melville."&#xD;
"Pain, father? I can bear it; my heart has&#xD;
schooled itself to trial for over two years."&#xD;
"Two years ! what do you mean by such a re-&#xD;
ference to time ?"&#xD;
"That I have loved the noble heart you would&#xD;
drive from my presence, for that period of time."&#xD;
"Loved George Melville for two years, and kept&#xD;
your secret from your father. Why has this been&#xD;
done ?"&#xD;
"To prevent any unnecessary step which might&#xD;
arouse the serpent to draw his folds around the&#xD;
object of my love."&#xD;
"And who do you mean shall personate the&#xD;
serpent in your filial simile ?" said Mr. Mortimer,&#xD;
entirely blinded by his dislike of Melville from&#xD;
taking Bell's meaning.&#xD;
"James Mordaunt, sir, the husband of Mary&#xD;
Wilcox; the viper who has stung Thomas Griswold,&#xD;
by ruining his father, and the suspected murderer of&#xD;
Rev. John Furnace."&#xD;
" And how would my possessing your confidence'&#xD;
have aroused this serpent ?"&#xD;
" By informing him of my secret. -I believe it&#xD;
will yet appear that James Mordaunt ruined James&#xD;
H. Griswold, to,.win Bell Mortimer's hand, believing&#xD;
that s hQmas F. Grisw&amp;amp;.d was her accepted lover,"&#xD;
said Bell.&#xD;

"You are rather wild, Bell, in your suspicions."&#xD;
said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"You said there was something of a painful nature&#xD;
which it was necessary I should know," said Bell.&#xD;
"I did, my daughter; and it is connected with&#xD;
George Melville."&#xD;
":Has the serpent bitten him,?" said Bell.&#xD;
" It may prove so ; but I cannot give you any of,&#xD;
the circumstances which surround his case. He has,&#xD;
probably, ere this been arrested to answer a charge&#xD;
preferred against him by the cashier of the 0-&#xD;
bank, at the city of Uh, for obtaining six hundred&#xD;
and twenty-dive dollars from that bank, upon a check&#xD;
which is pronounced to be a forgery."&#xD;
Bell's heart throbbed quickly. Notwithstanding&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer did his utmost to betray none of the&#xD;
satisfaction which he would not have acknowledged&#xD;
had existence, even to himself, yet Bell read his&#xD;
feelings.&#xD;
".And his misfortunes please my father," said&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
"'Viper' for one suitor charged with crime, and'&#xD;
misfortunes' for another," replied Mr. Mortimer.-&#xD;
Yes, sir ; and my sympathy, prayers, tears,&#xD;
anguish of soul, energies, to lift the cloud from the&#xD;
unfortunate,' and bring the 'viper' where the biter&#xD;
shall be bitten," said his daughter.&#xD;
Bell Mortimer at that moment made her father's&#xD;
eye quail before the intense passion which kindled in&#xD;
hers.&#xD;
9Toiorrow, sir, I go to the city of  .My&#xD;
father'd company will be acceptable, but not abso-&#xD;

&#xD;
" He will accompany you, Bell; but he advises his&#xD;
daughter to remain at Aurora."&#xD;
Bell could no longer control her feelings.  She&#xD;
threw herself into her father's arms and burst into&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"Father, you must give your daughter a sacred&#xD;
promise. George Melville, convicted, or acquitted&#xD;
from this charge, is my affianced husband. Though&#xD;
to the world he be proven guilty, to me and before&#xD;
Heaven he is innocent. Promise me never to thwart&#xD;
one effort I may make in his behalf. I will not ask&#xD;
your assistance. In return I promise never to marry&#xD;
without your consent. Be assured of one thing ;&#xD;
while George Melville lives, I remain true to. him."&#xD;
"This last resolve is rash ; but I readily give you&#xD;
the promise, and will add to it the assistance, unless&#xD;
your plans should appear to be inconsistent and&#xD;
unwise. You will then have my best advice. Bell&#xD;
sometimes forgets that her father loves her."&#xD;
"Let her acts prove the truth or 'error of that,&#xD;

A Station on the N. Y. Central Railroad-Car Manufactory-Recep-&#xD;
tion of a Convict at the Auburn State Prison-A Model Prison in&#xD;
the United States.&#xD;
THE reader will please pass over nine months in&#xD;
the history of George Melville.&#xD;
It is ten and a half o'clock in the morning. The&#xD;
sun shines with rich   grandeur over the city of&#xD;
Auburn. A cloud now and then flits across his disk,&#xD;
throwing a genial shadow over the face of the city ;&#xD;
a refreshing breeze causes the.green foliage which&#xD;
graces thousands upon thousands of the magnificent&#xD;
shade trees, for which Auburn is justly celebrated,&#xD;
to wave in beautiful contrast withthe unyielding&#xD;
front' of the solid masonry forming her principal&#xD;
buildings. We are waiting, at the New York Central,&#xD;
Railroad depot, the arrival of the eastern train.&#xD;
The cars are behind time ; something rather unu-&#xD;
sual for this well-conducted railroad.- Let us walk&#xD;
around the depot. This waiting the arrival of a train&#xD;
of cars in a strange place, is the essence of momen-&#xD;
tary-breeding enmui. We have reached the north&#xD;
end of the depot. Beyond we see several roomy&#xD;
structures, each several hundred feet in length, with&#xD;
height and breadth suited for manufacturing the&#xD;
&#xD;
princely-planned and decorated passenger cars, in&#xD;
which a traveller rides two or three hundred miles,&#xD;
and when at his journey's end, imagines he can step&#xD;
back home in a few minutes. The hum of machin-&#xD;
ery comes from the structures.. Enter- the-nearest.&#xD;
From ten to fifteen cars are in process of construc-&#xD;
tion.   It is a pleasing sight.   The skillful, indus-&#xD;
trious, and enterprising mechanic, multiplying his&#xD;
blows, as he shapes the .wood, or fashions the iron,&#xD;
stands there-thanks to the American Constitution,&#xD;
American institutions of learning, and American&#xD;
public sentiment-a man of influence, position, and&#xD;
caste.&#xD;
Toiling-rejoicimg-sorrowing,&#xD;
Onward through life he goes ;&#xD;
Each morning sees some task begin,&#xD;
Each evening sees it close;&#xD;
Something attempted, something done,&#xD;
Has earned a night's repose.&#xD;
"Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,&#xD;
For the lesson thou hast taught!&#xD;
Thus at the flaming forge of life&#xD;
Our fortunes must be wrought;&#xD;
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped&#xD;
Each burning deed and thought."*&#xD;
Now walk half the width of the depot, and stop at&#xD;
its northwest corner. That pile of solid masonry is&#xD;
the Auburn State Prison. Its architectural prbpor-&#xD;
tions and shape present a graceful but solid front.&#xD;
The wall before us appears to be at least: five hun,&#xD;
dried feet in length.    Its height must be equal to&#xD;
thirty or forty feet. At equal distances, upon the top&#xD;
of the wa1, are guard towers, designed to shelter the&#xD;

sentinels. That guardsman as, with musket brought&#xD;
t    shoulder, he treads the summit of the wall in&#xD;
measured :pace, occasionally casting an eye over his&#xD;
beat, speaks volumes to the casual traveller of the&#xD;
rigor  Ad discipline necessary to keep in strict sub-&#xD;
jeeton the picked company of desperadoes within.&#xD;
But there is no time to loiter. The train will soon be&#xD;
here.; We stop: to admire that knot of ladies and&#xD;
gentlemen who are issuing from the main entrance&#xD;
through the wall. As the immense iron gate strikes.&#xD;
back into its place, and the bolts return to their&#xD;
stone sockets, a shudder seems to run through the&#xD;
system. Has such a feeling ever been the foretaste&#xD;
of this celebrated prison to any of its present inmates,&#xD;
once as fully entitled to liberty as they are now re-&#xD;
strained of it?  We leave the spot, reflecting upon&#xD;
the question.&#xD;
Our next position is at the southwest corner of the&#xD;
depot. From   this spot Auburn lies before us. To&#xD;
the right, and standing in bass-relief against the&#xD;
horizon, rises a high elevation of land, having its&#xD;
summit crownedwith tall and stately forest trees. A&#xD;
gentlemanly young man, observing our interest in&#xD;
tlie, scene, informs us that the forest-clad height in the&#xD;
distance is "FortHill Oemetery,"said to be unrivalled&#xD;
in natural beauty. We make a note of this fact, and&#xD;
detenine at some future day to pay that hill a visit.&#xD;
:",Sho--oo---oo--oo-ooooo"&#xD;
The cars at last! The dpot bell rings a'few. mer -&#xD;
17 ntes-- doubtless a signal to passenger loiterers, as&#xD;
as to. the railroad officials and emptoyds;to be&#xD;
on the;alert. Within three feet of our position the&#xD;
iron horse stops. We turn to admire one of the most&#xD;

&#xD;
beautiful specimens of locomotion we ever yet exk&#xD;
amined: To our inquiry, where was that splendid&#xD;
machine built, the engineer points to the "Auburn&#xD;
State Prison."  We walk to the opposite side of the&#xD;
locomotive, intending to read the name of her build-&#xD;
er. But a sight here meets our gaze which causes a&#xD;
second shudder to rush through our veins. A young&#xD;
man, dressed in rich and gentlemanly style, has just&#xD;
emerged from the front car of the train... The irons&#xD;
are upon his right leg, and he is chained by the&#xD;
wrist to the officer who has him in charge.&#xD;
Who is that ?-who is that ?-who is that ? These&#xD;
inquiries emanate from the entire crowd. An answer&#xD;
is soon given.&#xD;
"CGeorge Melville, the forger."&#xD;
The excitement becomes intense. Who has not&#xD;
heard of George Melville, the forger ? They said he&#xD;
was very wealthy, and that money would get him clear.&#xD;
It had not, however. The Justice of the Supreme&#xD;
Court, and District Attorney of the city of U&#xD;
were. proof against corruption. Such were the re-&#xD;
marks of the crowd. They thought the governor&#xD;
might pardon him ; but nobody believed he would.&#xD;
He was the people's candidate, and they knew he&#xD;
would: not pardon a man merely because he had rich&#xD;
friends. And in this respect, the great mass of the&#xD;
people inAimerica are right. Their rulers well know,&#xD;
and seldom forget, the constituency to whom they are&#xD;
amenable for their acts, and by whom, as each elec-&#xD;
tion day returns, they are held strictly accountable.&#xD;
W   have resolved, "kind reader," not to take this&#xD;
train;, but to visit the prison, and.see what is to be&#xD;
done with " Melville the forge r." We stand in front&#xD;

of the gate, having advanced somewhat ahead of the&#xD;
crowd. The gate-keeper opens to our knock, and we&#xD;
are allowed to enter. On our left we notice a small&#xD;
but. neat and tastefully arranged flower-garden.&#xD;
Sdinethingof a contrast to our feelings of solemn awe&#xD;
and dread as we entered the gate. On our right is&#xD;
a green-lawn, shaded by beautiful trees. A fence se-&#xD;
parates the yard, as well as another, the garden, from&#xD;
the path we are in. Advancing, we ascend a flight&#xD;
of stone steps. We stop a moment to admire the&#xD;
front of this inner building, and find that .the blue&#xD;
limestone of the wall without is in contrast with a&#xD;
beautiful free-stone of the inner building. Entering,&#xD;
we find ourselves in a spacious hall, and the first idea&#xD;
that strikes us is the air of cleanliness which character-&#xD;
izes the place. We enter a door on the left. Within,&#xD;
several persons are collected, evidently engaged in&#xD;
discussing or conducting the affairs of the prison.&#xD;
We hand our card to the clerk, and watch the result.&#xD;
Ourname.is evidently entirely unknown to him; but&#xD;
he casts a modest, smiling glance at our person, and&#xD;
with the most gentlemanly politeness addresses us:&#xD;
Are you a visitor to Auburn ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
Do you desire to visit the prison ?"&#xD;
"If you please, and it is not inconsistent with yoiu&#xD;
rules."&#xD;
"Not at all, sir ; it is part of our duty to attend to&#xD;
thewishes of visitors. The price for going through&#xD;
istwenty-five cents. Perhaps, sir," continued the&#xD;
clerk, "you had better wait a few moments, as a&#xD;
scene of some interest will transpire here soon."&#xD;
Will wait with pleasure."&#xD;
&#xD;
The clerk opened the gate-to the railing, aid polite-&#xD;
ly handed us a chair, for whicL act we generously&#xD;
thanked him. The door now opened, and George&#xD;
Melville, the convictedforger, sentenced for five years&#xD;
to hard labor in the State Prison, stood before the&#xD;
railing, on the very spot we had just vacated. We&#xD;
learned that the persons who entered with him, be-&#xD;
sides the officers, were Thomas F. Griswold,, his junior&#xD;
counsel, Frederick Mortimer, son of Ion. B. F. Morti-&#xD;
mer of Aurora, two ladies closely veiled, and the&#xD;
father of the prisoner.&#xD;
"It has been whispered," the clerk informed me,&#xD;
" that this Melville was to have been married to Miss&#xD;
Mortimer;ithat Melville's father opposed the match,&#xD;
and stopped the supplies ; and that he committed the&#xD;
forgery to get married."&#xD;
An' officer of the ward entered the room. A few&#xD;
moments afterwards, a person, standing ready, at a&#xD;
signal from the Captain of the Wards, removed the&#xD;
irons from Melville. Melville, taking a rich diamond&#xD;
ring from his left hand, approached one of the ladies.&#xD;
Handing it, to her, he whispered a few words. She&#xD;
was standing near the' northeast corner of the room.&#xD;
Turning her back to the company, she gently raised&#xD;
her veil, and in a clear unbroken voice, spoke--&#xD;
"IGood bye, dear brother. We all feel you are&#xD;
innocent, and'God will yet give the world proof of&#xD;
it-&#xD;
Melville clasped his sister to his. breast and kissed&#xD;
her, smiling as complacently as if he were about to&#xD;
leave her to a night's repose in his father's home..&#xD;
Taking a second ring from his pocket, the jewel in&#xD;
which sparkled brilliantly, he approached the second&#xD;

lady. Gently raising her hand, which she imnedi-&#xD;
ately unloved, he placed this second ring upon her&#xD;
finger; as he stooped the better to accomplish his&#xD;
obet he imprinted a kiss upon her hand. This act&#xD;
was unnoticed by all in the room. Lifting her veil,&#xD;
she spoke a few words in a very low tone. The last&#xD;
sentences were as follows-&#xD;
"James Mordaunt shall yet take your place. You&#xD;
are satisfied this Robert Shank is the man you shot&#xD;
in the woods?&#xD;
"I am! Griswold has my full statement in writ-&#xD;
ing.' He knows all the 'circumstances, as he was an&#xD;
actor in the scene. I recognized him as I left the&#xD;
jail to come here," replied Melville.&#xD;
"kiss me, George !" said the lady.&#xD;
"Not here, dearest!" replied Melville; still hold-&#xD;
ing her hand.&#xD;
"Very well," replied she; "Igave you the first seal&#xD;
of our love. I will here give you the link which&#xD;
will prove that the chain is still unbroken."&#xD;
$he took his hand, and gracefully pressing it to her&#xD;
lips, spoke in an even, subdued tone, but one which&#xD;
could be distinctly heard all over the room.&#xD;
"George,.farewell five years hence, you will find,&#xD;
Bell Mortimer either on earth, or in heaven. James&#xD;
.ordaunt, I trust, may learn these words."'&#xD;
Melville turned from her, and grasping his father's&#xD;
hand, bade him good bye, saying-" Be a father to&#xD;
bhth'af your daughters." In turn, he then took leave&#xD;
1frederick Mortimer and Mr, Griswold. The scene&#xD;
now become almost insupportable. There was&#xD;
not  dryye n the room, unless we except that of&#xD;
the prisoner.'. He wore a quiet, but melancholy sniile.&#xD;
"   i '++  tm +          '*--   {"   ,I"&#xD;
&#xD;
When Melville's friends left the room; the clerk of&#xD;
the prison proceeded to question him touching his&#xD;
name, age, place of birth, occupation, etc., etc. He&#xD;
answered the questions readily and in a manly tone,&#xD;
betraying neither bravado, nor guilt. It was the&#xD;
tone of conscious innocence.&#xD;
Not an individual present failed to      form  this&#xD;
opinion, and freely expressed themselves on the sub-&#xD;
ject as soon as Melville had retired.&#xD;
Melville was ordered by the Captain of the Wards&#xD;
to take off his boots. His height was then taken,&#xD;
and. a full description of any particular marks .upon:&#xD;
his face, neck, etc., all of which was duly recorded&#xD;
by'the clerk. He was then led from the room.&#xD;
"If that man is a forger, he can act 'a part better&#xD;
. than any one I .ever saw," said the Inspector in&#xD;
charge, who chanced to be present.*&#xD;
This opinion was not dissented from. My own&#xD;
opinion certainly accorded with the remark, although&#xD;
a novice in such judgment.&#xD;
The lerk now    beckoned me to accompany him.&#xD;
Passing into the large hall I had first entered, hie led&#xD;
me into a second. Here was the first semblance of&#xD;
a prison which I had seen since passing the front&#xD;
gate. A heavy wicker partition set off about one-&#xD;
third of the entire room, making a hall between the&#xD;
* Some may doubt the truth of this picture of Bell Mortimer's&#xD;
conduct under the eyes of so many officers of the prison. Our answer&#xD;
is, that the present gentlemanly cleik of the Anburn State Prison,&#xD;
Mr. T-s Ds, while we were oece making a visit to that insti-&#xD;
tution, related'several instances in which the sober truth far surpasses&#xD;
the fiction. He gave us names and dates, and referred us to the re-&#xD;
cords of the prison in corroboration. We have purposely softened&#xD;
the picture:&#xD;

wicker work and three sides of the room. A heavy&#xD;
gate, bearing an immense lock, closed the entrance&#xD;
from the main room to the hall beyond the partition.&#xD;
Opposite this was a heavy door, nearly covered&#xD;
with strong iron bars, the machinery of which-was&#xD;
so nicely adjusted, that they were all, moved by one&#xD;
connecting rod accessible only in the main room.&#xD;
Thus, when the heavy door, which was one of the&#xD;
principal entrances to the prison, was opened, the&#xD;
person or persons admitted thereby, could not pass&#xD;
beyond the wicker partition until the gate -was in&#xD;
turn opened. By this arrangement one man could&#xD;
stop a thousand, and even should the attending keeper&#xD;
fall asleep, he could not be surprised. Two other&#xD;
main entrances, precisely similar to that already&#xD;
described, open into this wicker hail. One at the&#xD;
south, and one at the north end of the room.&#xD;
At a signal from the clerk, the wicker gate was&#xD;
opened,-and I was invited to walk through-.&#xD;
" We won't detain you against your will, sir. Now&#xD;
you are in durance, if not in durance vile,"esaid the&#xD;
clerk, with a-gentlemanly smile-.&#xD;
I followed him to the south entrance of the hall.&#xD;
tremendous rattling of bolts and bars grated on&#xD;
my ear as -if by magic, when the clerk. grasped a&#xD;
bright iron handle onx the door, polished by long&#xD;
use, and commenced pulling steadily, and with con-&#xD;
siderable power. The door gradually swung open,&#xD;
requiring an exertion of considerable strength to&#xD;
stop its momentum and shut it again. I now found&#xD;
mygelf in a. capacious but unfurnished room. At one&#xD;
corner of this room was a right-angle4 partition, cut-&#xD;
*       ting off a small room from the larger. Into this the&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
clerk introduced me. Before us stood George Mel-&#xD;
ville, the convicted forger, He was arrayed in the&#xD;
uniform of the prisoners. It consisted of a thick&#xD;
coarse, cloth, with light-blue and white stripes alter-&#xD;
nate. The garments consisted of roundabout, -vest,&#xD;
pants and cloth cap, all of the same material. In&#xD;
place of his closely-fitting and graceful patent-leather&#xD;
boots, he had on a coarse but serviceable pair of&#xD;
kipskin shoes. His smile had left him. A settled&#xD;
melancholy had spread over his countenance. In&#xD;
answer to my question asking permission to speak&#xD;
with him, the clerk informed me it was against the&#xD;
regulations of the prison. I could only look my sym-&#xD;
pathy, and that he had to the fullest extent of one&#xD;
who believed he suffered wrongfully.&#xD;
He had been assigned a place in the hospital.&#xD;
At present, however, the posts were all filled there,&#xD;
and he was to be put in the first vacancy which&#xD;
should occur. Until then, he was ordered to the&#xD;
machine shop. As I heard the Captain of the Wards&#xD;
inform Melville of this, a gleam as of satisfaction came&#xD;
over his face ; but in this I might have been mis-&#xD;
taken: account for it, I certainly could not. The&#xD;
labor of a machinist, compared to that of a hospital&#xD;
nurse, is as ten to one. I thought, as he left the&#xD;
room in company with the officer, that his white&#xD;
hands and delicate constitution were but ill suited&#xD;
to the labors of a machinist.&#xD;
The clerk, having finished the business which&#xD;
called him to this room, conducted me, through a&#xD;
small hallyinto a large airy doom, filled with benches.&#xD;
It had the appearance of a very large lecture-room.&#xD;
"This, sir, is called te chapel. We have public&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7805-00000113"/>&#xD;
222         GEORGE     ELVILLE.&#xD;
religious services here on the Sabbath, which ali the&#xD;
convictsusually attend," said the clerk.&#xD;
"What persuasion is adopted ?" I asked.&#xD;
"Sometimes one, and sometimes another. The form&#xD;
ofeorship .is left with the chaplain. Last year we&#xD;
had a clergyman of the Episcopal form; this year we,.&#xD;
have a Methodist; another year we may have a&#xD;
Presbyterian. It depends upon the Board of In-&#xD;
spectors, who have got the-appointing" power,"replied&#xD;
the clerk..&#xD;
From this room we proceeded to the hospital, situ-&#xD;
ated directly over the chapel. Quite a number of&#xD;
patients were under treatment. It was the hour&#xD;
when the hospital physician made his daily visit.&#xD;
-He was present, and busily engaged examining new&#xD;
cases from the different parts of this huge establish-&#xD;
ment. How he ever accomplished his task was a&#xD;
mystery to me; but his questions were put to, and&#xD;
answered by, the complaining convicts in rapid suc-&#xD;
cession. A benevolent smile pervaded his counte-&#xD;
nance, though he appeared to be a man prompt in&#xD;
decision, and inflexible when his judgment had been&#xD;
passed. The efforts which some of the complainants&#xD;
made to sham sickness, and obtain a few days' re-&#xD;
spite from labor, were amusing. Many, however,&#xD;
were: sick. Such received his earnest and most prac-&#xD;
tical advice. The physician of a hospital like this&#xD;
must feel a weighty responsibility. In one respect,&#xD;
the hospital of this prison differs frontany we have&#xD;
ever visited. It appeared to be the convicts' para-&#xD;
dise. Here, convicts' fare and rations were changed&#xD;
for comforts, and even luxuries. In extreme cases,&#xD;
the rarest delicacies of the market arefreelyordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.                223&#xD;
The officers of the prison, in the hospital surround-&#xD;
ings, seem to feel that the eyes of an exacting .con-&#xD;
stituency are upon them. For this reason, disease&#xD;
is here grappled and fought with every advantage&#xD;
which wisdom, in affluence, would naturally take.&#xD;
As this idea possessed our mind, we frankly own it&#xD;
made us feel proud of the Empire. State.&#xD;
We returned to the keeper's, hall, where I was&#xD;
surprised to see quite a large party of ladies and gen-&#xD;
tlemen in waiting to pass through the prison. The'&#xD;
clerk requested me to hand my ticket, which he had&#xD;
given me for my quarter of a dollar, to the keeper in&#xD;
charge. -Again the heavy wicker gate opened, and&#xD;
the party, consisting of about a dozen individuals,&#xD;
were conducted into what we have denominated a&#xD;
wicker kcall-this for want of a better title ; but this&#xD;
time the keeper took the gate opposite the one through&#xD;
which I had followed the clerk. We made our exit&#xD;
by the north door, precisely similar in appearance,&#xD;
size, and fastenings to the south and west doors.&#xD;
Through it we were all ishered. The idea at once&#xD;
strikes the mind-so, at least, happened on this occa-&#xD;
sion to a beautiful young lady, evidently a farmer's&#xD;
daughter, one of the party, a stranger, as indeed were&#xD;
all, to ourself. She remarked to her companion:&#xD;
" I wonder if the keeper intends to have us all go&#xD;
.to rost?&#xD;
" It looks like it," said Iber companion.&#xD;
" I shall have to ask him to give me a cell entirely&#xD;
'alone, then," continued the blooming girl.&#xD;
"Youdon't want to break loose from the minister's&#xD;
knot a'ready, do you, Molly ?"&#xD;
"Yesif we can't have a bigger bedroom than one&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
of these cells," replied the fair ;girl, half sotto voce,&#xD;
whom I now concluded had that morning given her-&#xD;
self over to the manly-looking countryman, for better&#xD;
or Worse, to love, honor, and . . The rest of the&#xD;
vow is distasteful.&#xD;
Gallery after gallery, range after range of these&#xD;
cells, we now rapidly passed; every one, a small&#xD;
dungeon, except that the adjective "dark" would&#xD;
not apply. They are all lighted by an iron grating,&#xD;
about two feet square. But the keeper hastens our&#xD;
footsteps-we descend to the floor. These cells are&#xD;
built in tiers one above another, some eight or ten in&#xD;
number, of solid masonry ; every door is of'iron, and&#xD;
heavily locked. From our present position on the&#xD;
ground floor,: the distance to the highest tier, is so&#xD;
great, that it fills the mind with wonder as well as&#xD;
vastness. The idea of sleeping in one of those cells&#xD;
for one night, alone ought to deter men from crime&#xD;
Why they fail to do this may possibly be answered&#xD;
by the idea that depraved hearts are willing to rut&#xD;
the risk of discovery. There are few convicts sen&#xD;
teniced upon confession, compared to the number&#xD;
sentenced upon conviction.&#xD;
We are now introduced to a scene of airy-like&#xD;
activity.  Blows'! blows !-click-a-click !-click-a.&#xD;
click-a-click-! ,whir-r-r-r!  whir-rr-r! -- whir-r-r-r&#xD;
From sixty to a hundred men are here making barrels.&#xD;
As ourtparty enters, nearly every eye is turned upon&#xD;
us; can it be these men, isolated from the world to&#xD;
expiate their crimes against human law, are looking&#xD;
niously among our party for a smile of home?&#xD;
This must be the solution of that simultaneous gaze,&#xD;
so unlike a work-shop filled with honest mechanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.                225&#xD;
Sometimes, even a question, which demands a reply,&#xD;
will fail to take an honest mechanic's eye from his&#xD;
work. The contrast causes an involuntary sigh of&#xD;
pity, which reflection soon informs the heart to be&#xD;
misplaced; they need pity for their crimes, not for&#xD;
their lot. We leave the "cooper shop" and enter&#xD;
the " hames shop," where the trappings of carriages&#xD;
and all kinds of harness mountings are manufac-&#xD;
tured; we next enter the "tool shop." The ponderous&#xD;
machinery in this place astonishes us, considering&#xD;
our preconceived notions ; almost as far as the eye&#xD;
can reach and distinguish, appear work-benches,&#xD;
each one occupied by a single convict engaged in&#xD;
fashioning, or finishing some tool necessary to a&#xD;
carpenter and joiner's kit, or chest. More than&#xD;
eighty different varieties of tools are here manufac-&#xD;
tured, and, while they are afforded cheaper than,&#xD;
they are said to be equal to, the foreign -article.&#xD;
If memory serves aright, we must do "merrie Eng-&#xD;
land" justice in the steel. English steel is used to&#xD;
tip the best plane-irons. American steel, however, is&#xD;
also used for the same purpose, and the purely&#xD;
American tool is said to obtain a wide popularity&#xD;
among mechanics. We now approach what the&#xD;
. keeper informs us is the "State shop," where the&#xD;
half-way sick convicts are sent, who do not need hos-&#xD;
pital attention. They are employed to do such work&#xD;
as they are able, or are suffered to remain idle,&#xD;
subject to the judgment of the keeper in charge.&#xD;
Great leniency is 'manifested, and the utmost pre-&#xD;
caution taken to commit no errors in such judgment.&#xD;
We now cross an open court and enter a range of&#xD;
buildings to the south. In succession we pass&#xD;
10*&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7805-00000115"/>&#xD;
226         GEO      -MELVILLE.&#xD;
through a " cabinet shop," " shoe shop," "tailor&#xD;
shop,"' for manufacturing convict clothing, " dye&#xD;
house," and finally, an extensive "machine shop."&#xD;
Machinery of all kinds, and of the most ponderous&#xD;
character, is before us in process of manufacturing,&#xD;
and under all stages of progress. Upon inquiry, we&#xD;
learn that the enterprise of the great West, Canada&#xD;
on the north, the chivalrous South, and the calcu-&#xD;
lating East, is represented by this half-finished ma-&#xD;
chinery. That engine is ordered by a firm in Upper&#xD;
Canada; this ponderous iron planing-machine is for&#xD;
/ a bold man and cool head off on the prairies; that&#xD;
immense range of shafting is for a factory in New&#xD;
England; that beautiful specimen of steam power&#xD;
i for a new establishment in the great commercial&#xD;
emporium for the trade over the American lakes.&#xD;
The-gentlemanly keeper whispers a sentence in our&#xD;
ear..&#xD;
"Do you see that young convict receiving direc-&#xD;
tions from another convict, far to the right $"&#xD;
"Yes, sir; why, that is 'Melville the forger.' "&#xD;
"jAh, sir ! you know him then.. I chanced to be&#xD;
in the keeper's hall when he passed through ; he&#xD;
don't: appear to 'feel very bad just now ; after he&#xD;
gets a taste of hard work, his spirits will begin to&#xD;
droop more, and he will regret that he could not&#xD;
appreciate the difference between a true and forged&#xD;
signature."&#xD;
"Idon't believe he is a guilty man," we ventured&#xD;
to"suggest to the keeper.&#xD;
"That isthe usual sympathy of men unaccustomed&#xD;
to deal with rascals; they can assume innocence&#xD;
better than a hungry man can handle his knife&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELYILLE,               27&#xD;
and fork. There isn't a convict in the prison,. not&#xD;
sentenced upon confession, who will say he is&#xD;
guilty."&#xD;
This remark of the     keeper,  we afterwards&#xD;
learned, was, in the main, correct ; and, in it, we&#xD;
discover why the application, of the executive cle-&#xD;
mency becomes a privilege most difficult to be exer-&#xD;
cised. No doubt, innocence, as, the reader knows&#xD;
was the case with George Melville, sometimes be-&#xD;
comes a sacrifice to the majesty of the law; but&#xD;
more frequently the law forgets her prerogatives, and&#xD;
allows the guilty to have the benefit of the doubt,&#xD;
rather than that innocence should suffer.  More&#xD;
frequently, too, the executive clemency is interposed&#xD;
upon the divine law, that ten guilty should escape;&#xD;
rather than that one innocent man should suffer.&#xD;
We leave this shop, and enter a "spinning and&#xD;
carding shop." For this enumeration of the prine-&#xD;
pal workshops, i this prison, we doubt not, most of&#xD;
our readers will thank us. It is a sprinkling of the&#xD;
actual upon the imaginative. We will now ascend&#xD;
the open court, which was crossed a few moments&#xD;
since. This courtis extensive, being several hundred&#xD;
feet long, by at least two hundred, and perhaps more&#xD;
in width. We approach the central entrance to the&#xD;
keeper's hall. A flight of about twenty stone steps&#xD;
leads from the court'to the stone platform in front of&#xD;
the entrance. A large bell rings. The platform aid&#xD;
all the standing room upon the steps; is filled with&#xD;
ladies and gentlemen, visitors for the mnorning to the&#xD;
prison. In long columns, marching in single file,&#xD;
back to breast, the entire convict force of the prison&#xD;
are. seen emerging at different points from as many&#xD;

&#xD;
places as there are shops, and in as many companies,&#xD;
each company taking up its line of march in the,&#xD;
court. Occasionally, as was the fact at this time, a&#xD;
band of music, themselves guests for the morning, at&#xD;
the request of the agent, make the stony walls reecho&#xD;
to the strains of " the march," as, with a skill that&#xD;
would have awakened commendation from a " Bel-&#xD;
lini," they gladden the thousand hearts which, in&#xD;
those convict ranks,&#xD;
"Are beating funeral marches to the grave."&#xD;
Say not, sons of liberty, in this world of error, that&#xD;
a "Per" cannot find a second "tear-drop " bedew-&#xD;
ing the "repentant cheek" of some convict, with&#xD;
which passport to.open again the. pQrtals of heaven.&#xD;
See!-those eyes in that column marching so closely&#xD;
in review are not all dry. Is that young convict&#xD;
who draws a sleeve over his face, the husband? Has&#xD;
he discovered the wife of his bosom among the crowd&#xD;
of visitors? Is that one-the grey-locked old convict&#xD;
-a father? See! he sheds a tear. This weeping&#xD;
female at my side-was that a' daughter's kiss she&#xD;
threw so suddenly when the old man marched by?&#xD;
Such a tear-drop at least looks like repentance.&#xD;
The last column has passed-no ! there, down on the&#xD;
left, comes one more. Three keepers walk steadily&#xD;
by its side. There must be at least a hundred men&#xD;
in that column.  They march in single file,b&#xD;
to breast; their step is wondrously reIta&#xD;
eems like the step of a single man; butjM ,ai&#xD;
tingtly the footsteps sound I tread-trea ,d&#xD;
tread. It is almost impossible to dissipate tiillu&#xD;
sion even with the reality before us. And there-&#xD;
&#xD;
es! 'tis he ! That young man is "George Melville,&#xD;
the forger." And those convicts are the machinists.&#xD;
thEen yet he wears that melancholy truthfulness.&#xD;
No he cannot be really a forger. How terrible the&#xD;
thought ! does he'suffer innocently?&#xD;

More about the Prison.&#xD;
Ti heavy bolts rattle ,again, and the crowd of&#xD;
visitors are. once more admitted to the "keeper's&#xD;
hall." My thanks are due the olerk, for what I have&#xD;
now learned was an especial favor, and I go to his&#xD;
office. He has not the time nor liberty to bestow&#xD;
upon all a hospital visit. The sick would suffer&#xD;
from the gaze of the curious.&#xD;
"And did you see the convicts at dinner, after&#xD;
they had marched into the dining-room ?" said the&#xD;
clerk, in reply to our thanks.&#xD;
" I did not, sir."&#xD;
"If you have the time, we will go and see them."&#xD;
"Thank yoi1; I shall be pleased to do so," was my&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
We return to the "keeper's hall."    A   small&#xD;
door, leading into. a stairway, and which I had not&#xD;
before observed, was opened for us. We descend&#xD;
into a very large room with a stone floor. The nasal&#xD;
organ is assailed with the savor of the cuisine.&#xD;
"This is the kitchen," said the clerk. "Here, in&#xD;
this side room, the cooking is done. Those huge iron&#xD;
caldrons are the cooking utensils.  By means of&#xD;
them, .we feed between seven and eight hundred&#xD;
convicts three meals daily."&#xD;
&#xD;
We next entered the dining-room. Here was a&#xD;
sight indeed, for a novice to wonder at. Eight hun-&#xD;
dred convicts, men of all grades in crime, age, and&#xD;
education.; epresentatives of all climes, nations, and&#xD;
tongues ; and all of them members of the human&#xD;
family, filled with passions, energies, minds, like our&#xD;
own, but, for the time, dead to the world.&#xD;
The clerk requests me to follow him. We make a&#xD;
half circuit of the room, but it is impossible to hear&#xD;
conversation, on account of the clatter of knives and&#xD;
forks. One thing we notice. The plates are all of&#xD;
wood. If crockery was known here, the breakage&#xD;
for one day would supply the raw material for a&#xD;
meal.&#xD;
"There is Melville, the forger," said the clerk,&#xD;
putting his mouth close to my ear and speaking in a&#xD;
loud tone.&#xD;
Once more I looked upon this young man. He:&#xD;
was doing his utmost to swallow a few morsels of the&#xD;
plain but wholesome food offered him.&#xD;
"That young man, I believe, is no more guilty of&#xD;
committing forgery than I,"aid the clerk.&#xD;
I was surprised at this remark ; but as I subse-&#xD;
quently learned, it is remarkable how accurately and&#xD;
quickly. prison- officers of long standing can detect&#xD;
real and assumed innocence in a convict. The&#xD;
officers. seldom express these convictions.  On this&#xD;
occasion, however, the clerk had evidently given&#xD;
Melville his, heartfelt sympathy, a circumstance&#xD;
which was to benefit him afterwards.&#xD;
"Now, sir, if you desire to take a walk of about&#xD;
three-quarters of a mile, we will make a circuit of&#xD;
the prison walls."&#xD;

&#xD;
This kindness on the part of the clerk, it was diffi-&#xD;
cult for me to accept. I feared he was offering more&#xD;
than I ought to take advantage of.&#xD;
"No sir," said he, in reply to my objections; "I&#xD;
anrot in perfect condition for work to-day, and the&#xD;
exercise will be a practical advantage to me. Do&#xD;
not let me make my offer a trespass upon your time,&#xD;
however."&#xD;
I accepted his kindness without further remark,&#xD;
and we proceeded at once to the front gate, where I&#xD;
had first entered the prison. Here, on each side of&#xD;
theimmense iron gate, and each forming part of the&#xD;
wall, are two large towers, built of cut stone. The&#xD;
walls proper are built of hewn stone. In the southern&#xD;
tower is the gate-keeper's lodge. In the northern&#xD;
tower is a spiral staircase, forming a communication&#xD;
with the top of the wall. This staircase we ascended.&#xD;
It would be impossible to incorporate into the text of&#xD;
this history the really magnificent views constantly&#xD;
recurring to.the pedestrian, making the circuit of the&#xD;
main wall inclosing the Auburn State Prison. The&#xD;
wall forms an oblong square, seemingly, five hundred&#xD;
by twelve hundred feet. These distances are only&#xD;
approximate ; but they are very near the truth. To&#xD;
describe the impression made on the mind by this&#xD;
walk is a difficult task for the pen. The vastness of&#xD;
this structure fills the mind with awe. It incloses all&#xD;
the necessities requisite for a score of manufactories,&#xD;
complete in'all their parts, together with an immense&#xD;
hotel, or boarding-house, capable of sustaining and&#xD;
providing lodgment for thousands. Each and every&#xD;
part of the structures within the walls bears the e vi-&#xD;
dences which speak of the strengt'. necessary to con-&#xD;
&#xD;
GEOIVRGE MELVILLE.               233&#xD;
fine vice, wickedness and crime. Without, there is&#xD;
a contrast ; as far as the eye can reach, are the em-&#xD;
blems of freedom; earth, air, homes, beautiful shade-&#xD;
trees, and'in the distance, stately forests and fields of&#xD;
waving corn; to the south, numerous church spires&#xD;
point towards heaven where the convicted felon,&#xD;
judge, jurors, citizens, all must congregate on the&#xD;
great and final day; to the east, a stately and solid&#xD;
structure, where, our companion informs us, stu-&#xD;
dents of theology, in one of the Christian denomma-&#xD;
tions, are made ambassadors of the good news to man.&#xD;
Is the contrast fearful? We have endeavored to picture&#xD;
the facts of this walk. Will the reader, as he gazes&#xD;
upon the scene, try to learn the important lessons&#xD;
which they, teach?&#xD;
We have now reached the middle of the western'&#xD;
wall.&#xD;
But what is that wall beyond this ?"&#xD;
" That," replied the clerk, "incloses part of the&#xD;
State property ; and there, to the left, is the burial&#xD;
ground of the prison. It has been secured to meet&#xD;
the wants of 'a sovereignty growing like the Empire&#xD;
State, and will be necessary at a future day. As na-,&#xD;
tions wax fat, criminals multiply."&#xD;

dered this morning at the opening of the court. We.&#xD;
shall get all the particulars by eleven o'clock."&#xD;
"Cannot you order a carriage, father, and let me&#xD;
be present at this last scene of James Mordaunt's&#xD;
triunph ?"&#xD;
"No, Bell. I must ask you to rest content with&#xD;
what I have already conceded in. coming with you,&#xD;
and assisting in this defence. - The. labor, too, has&#xD;
been a useless waste of=time, for the testimony against&#xD;
Melville is so overwhelming, there is no hope for him.&#xD;
He must go to prison, Bell."&#xD;
"1George says he is innocent, father."&#xD;
He may beb; ut innocence and the testimony&#xD;
against-him are opposite poles on the earth. He went&#xD;
to his room, the very room opposite the one you now&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.                235&#xD;
occupy. A waiter of the house testifies that he saw&#xD;
him go there ; that he saw him ten minutes afterwards&#xD;
descending the stairs, dressed in a particular coat ;&#xD;
that he saw him come into the bar-room half an hour&#xD;
after, having on the same coat ; and on the cross-ex-&#xD;
amination, that he could not be mistaken, that he&#xD;
knew him perfectly well. Mr. Robert Shank testi-&#xD;
fies that he saw a man having on such a coat, which&#xD;
was shown to the witness, present a check for six&#xD;
hundred and twenty-five dollars, at the very hour&#xD;
testified to by the'banker. The cashier and the teller&#xD;
of the bank testify to his identity and the presenta-&#xD;
tion and payment of the check. The partners of-the&#xD;
firm, whose firm name is attached to the check, have&#xD;
all seen the same 'in open court, and testified that it&#xD;
is. a forgery. Their book-keeper has testified to the&#xD;
same. The defence amounts to just nothing at all.&#xD;
Not one allegation of Melville's can he sustain by&#xD;
proof. He acknowledges that he went to his room,&#xD;
in the hotel. He also says that he sat down and&#xD;
wrote a long letter, which he finished just as the&#xD;
waiter called to get his valise, at the hour for the de-&#xD;
parture of the train going east ; that he took the&#xD;
train, and went directly to Aurora; that he was never&#xD;
in the O-   Bank inhis life."&#xD;
"But, father, George says the whole affair is a con-&#xD;
spiracy to ruin him, and that he believes James Mor-&#xD;
dauntis at the bottom of it."&#xD;
" He must prove it, Bell."&#xD;
Everything appears to be dark now; but the time&#xD;
will come when there will be sunlight, father."&#xD;

race among men of integrity is run."&#xD;

The jury have rendered their ver dict. I: is against George. The&#xD;

Shank, George has recognized as the robber hom, he shot in the&#xD;
woods several years since. I have also recog iized him. This will&#xD;

When Bell had finished reading her note, she im-&#xD;
mediately tore it into a hundred pieces.&#xD;
"What is that for, Bell ?" said her father. "Is it&#xD;
not from Mir. Griswold ?"&#xD;
A' It is, and announces the verdict."&#xD;
" What is it ?"&#xD;
"Guilty, sir; and would to Heaven I might go and&#xD;
share his fortunes in a prison."&#xD;
But Bell Mortimer little knew the real effect upon&#xD;
her. health which the last few months of anguish,&#xD;
anxiety and excitement, had produced. Two hours&#xD;
front that moment, her father bent over the form of&#xD;
his beautiful daughter, prostrated upon a bed of sick-&#xD;
ness. A raging fever attacked the lovely girl, and&#xD;
brought her within a short step of the grave. Then&#xD;
it was the father's -turn to suffer. His anxiety for&#xD;
his daughter's life was only equalled by his exertions&#xD;
to save her.   Mrs. Mortimer was immediately sent&#xD;
for. Three weeks after, when Bell again walked her&#xD;
room, a mere skeleton of her former self, and could&#xD;
once more gaze into her father's eye with the old&#xD;
smile of affection, and faintly thank him    for all his&#xD;
kindness, then he resolved never again to speak to&#xD;

her, even what he felt to be just, if it was against&#xD;
George Melville. lie resolved also to know the&#xD;
trth, if James Mordaunt had really planned Mel-&#xD;
Ville's destruction. If such was the .fact, his daugh-&#xD;
ter's sufferings lay at James Mordaunt's door. Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer was a man of the world, filled with the&#xD;
world's ambition; but he was also a kind man at&#xD;
heart, and when aroused- to accomplish a purpose,&#xD;
few could do more, or commit less errors of judg-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Thorhas Griswold had obtained a stay of prodeed-&#xD;
is, which procrastinated the final sentence of his&#xD;
friend for a few weeks. He did not shake the ver-&#xD;
diet. As the reader has already learned, George&#xD;
Melville was sentenced to prison for a term of five&#xD;
years.&#xD;

week. You will not hear from me until that time."&#xD;
4"Good bye, father. Always love your Bell; will&#xD;
you not, dear father ?"&#xD;
A tear glistened in Mr. Mortimer's eye, as he gave&#xD;
his horses the word to start. Had Bell Mortimer, at&#xD;
that instant been able to look into the depths of her&#xD;
father's heart, she might have seen a resolution in&#xD;
her behalf which would have brought back her&#xD;
smiles; but, Mr. Mortimer had learned the. benefit&#xD;
of silence, until he could speak of results. He had&#xD;
now been but a few days at home. He had remained&#xD;
only until he could be certain that his daughter's&#xD;
health was established. His journey was solely on&#xD;
her account. At eleven o'clock, the following mor-&#xD;
ning, he was at the office of J. S. Taylor, Eq., in&#xD;

of a business nature for your ear. Can we employ&#xD;
a few hours together, to-day ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, sir," replied Mr. Taylor. "We shall&#xD;
be less liable to interruption in my private office."&#xD;
" Mr. Taylor, you have, doubtless, learned from&#xD;
Mr. Griswold the particulars of George Melville's&#xD;
trial, conviction and sentence ; also, the suspicions&#xD;
which are entertained against James Mordaunt."&#xD;
"I have, sir."&#xD;
"Very well. I have learned from my son a gene-&#xD;
ral outline of what you have against, Mordaurit.&#xD;
Whether guilt or innocence attaches to Mr. Mor-&#xD;
daunt, is my present object. When will you try the&#xD;
action instituted in behalf of Mary Wilcox ?"&#xD;
"Mordaunt has postponed the trial twice; it may&#xD;
not reach a hearing under six months. I do not&#xD;
think he can postpone it again, however."&#xD;
"Very well. I have six months to work in,&#xD;
then."&#xD;
" How so? Will I have your assistance in this&#xD;
difficult and perplexing matter ?"&#xD;
"1As a client, you will, Mr. Taylor. I am interested&#xD;

facts in the case, after which he left Mr. Taylor, with&#xD;
a promise to call again soon.&#xD;
His next call was upon Thomas Griswold.&#xD;
From Griswold he learned the important fact that&#xD;
Gerge Melville had recognized in the witness&#xD;
Robert Shank, a highwayman whom he had formerly&#xD;
shot.&#xD;
"What are you doing about him, Mr. Griswold ?"&#xD;
"We are giving him rope by which he may hang&#xD;
himself. Chief M  -l has him in charge. Every&#xD;
movement he makes for the next six months will be&#xD;
recorded in that book," said Griswold, pointing to a&#xD;
blank book on the table. "He has been seen in&#xD;
Mordaunt's office twice already. That shows nothing,&#xD;
but it is significant."&#xD;
"What are you doing with Mordaunt ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Tryon's new coachman is a police officer.&#xD;
Besides thi, every movement Mordaunt makes will&#xD;
be carefully watched and studied," replied Griswold.&#xD;
That is all very good, Mr. Griswold, but there is&#xD;
one source of information you are leaving unex-&#xD;
plred."&#xD;
"What is that 2"&#xD;
s it impossible to find who have been servants&#xD;
at Mrs. Tryon's for the past three years'? You may&#xD;
possibly trace, this Robert Shank into close intimacy&#xD;
with Mordaunt by this means."&#xD;
" That is true. I will make a note of it," said&#xD;
Griswold."&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer next started for the city of Brooklyn,&#xD;
Y   His object was to have a personal interview&#xD;
withtMary Wilcox. For this purpose he had ob-&#xD;
tained a note:of introduction from .Mr Taylor.&#xD;

The result of this interview, while it did not fail t&#xD;
excite Mr. Mortiner's heartfelt sympathy in her be-&#xD;
half, added nothig material to the evidence An'the&#xD;
case.&#xD;
He next proceeded to call upon Mrs. Furnace, the&#xD;
widow of the Rev. John Furnace, whose remarkable&#xD;
disappearance had never been accounted for. He ob-&#xD;
tained from her the time of the funeral;- the hour Mr.&#xD;
Furnace left his home; a minute description of his&#xD;
dressjewelry, watch; in ne, of every article which he&#xD;
had about him that she could remember. This being&#xD;
accomplished, he retn fie to his hotel He now sent&#xD;
a messenger, requestin 'the chief of police to detail&#xD;
two active and shrewd policemen for his special ser-&#xD;

Mr. Mortimer's room, accompanied by the desired&#xD;
policemen. Upon learning what Mr. Mortimer's ob-&#xD;

While he had never lost sight of the matter, he&#xD;
readily confessed that the results thus far had been&#xD;
very unsatisfactory.&#xD;

him. Melville shot his *companion.  On the same&#xD;
evening, Shank attempted to shoot Melville, when&#xD;

exposed Mordaunt to me in the Mary Wilcox matter.&#xD;
We will suppose how, for the sake of the theory, that&#xD;
George MIeMille's story is true, and that he is a victim&#xD;
ofJames Mordaunt's revenge. Robert Shank is a prin-&#xD;
cipal witness to convict him of forgery. Of course&#xD;
no suspicion can attach against the officers of the&#xD;
bank, or against any of the other witneses upon&#xD;
whose testimony, Melville was convicted. Hobert&#xD;
Shank therefore stands alone, open to suspicion~&#xD;
"And of course he would be James Mordgnt's&#xD;
tool," interrupted Chief M -1; "inasmuch as your&#xD;
theory supposes that Melville's conviction was a&#xD;
plot to prevent him from obtaining Miss ortimer's&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
"Just so !" said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"But Shank might have plotted this eoviction to&#xD;
revenge the shot," suggested the chief of police&#xD;
" Possibly; but not likely. It was a plot which&#xD;
required awyer's brain to lay out, end a Robert&#xD;
Shank to execute."&#xD;
"I suppose the balance of your theory is as fol-&#xD;

lows,' said Chief M -1. "That when Mary Wil-&#xD;
coxfirst sought for her rights, James Mordaunt desired&#xD;
the death of the Rev. John Furnace to destroy testi-&#xD;
moy. That Robert Shank was the tool. That the&#xD;
funeral was a sham, merely to decoy the clergyman&#xD;
into place where it would be safe to murder him;&#xD;
and, that it was the head-work of James Mordaunt."&#xD;
"You have the whole, sir, intuitively," said Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer.&#xD;
"And Mr. Mortimer, your theory will yet give a&#xD;
correct solution of this tangled web of crime."&#xD;
At an early hour the following morning, Chief&#xD;
M---1, accompanied by Hon. B. F. Mortimer, en-&#xD;
tered Greenwood Cemetery. The officers, sent the&#xD;
day previous, upon examining the records of the cem-&#xD;
etery, found that on the afternoon of the clergyman's&#xD;
disappearance, three interments had been made.&#xD;
That made at six o'clock was doubtless the one they&#xD;
ought to examine. Orders were issued by the officers&#xD;
of the cemetery which allowed the opening of the&#xD;
grave. When the chief arrived, the grave had been&#xD;
opened, but the coffin had not been disturbed. The&#xD;
outer box, which was in a good state of preservation,&#xD;
being opened, revealed a common cherry coffin.. This&#xD;
being in turn opened, revealed a mass of dirt and&#xD;
stones.&#xD;
"The body has returned to dust pretty quick,"&#xD;
observed one of the policemen.&#xD;
"Let not a man touch a stone in that coffin with-&#xD;
out my orders," said the chief.&#xD;
Turning to one of the policemen, he said-.&#xD;
"ESave you brought the boards ?"&#xD;
"yes, sir I"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Put them together."&#xD;
In a few moments, a large platform like a flooring,&#xD;
with a planed surface, and grooved tightly together,&#xD;
was spread out upon the grass.&#xD;
"Empty the contents of the coffin on that," said&#xD;
the chief.&#xD;
This was immediately done.&#xD;
"Three of you watch the proceedings. Keep your&#xD;
eyes constantly upon the work. Rountree and Baker&#xD;
may carefully examine the whole mass."&#xD;
The chief's, orders were obeyed to the letter. In&#xD;
a few moments, the officer addressed as Rountree,&#xD;
offered to the chief a jack-knife. The blade wad so&#xD;
completely rusted that it was almost part of the&#xD;
handle. No effort was made to open it.&#xD;
"Was that in the heap ?" said-the chief, not touch-&#xD;
ing it.&#xD;
"It was, sir," said Rountree.&#xD;
" Place a mark upon it that you may be able to&#xD;
recognize it again. Gentlemen, you may all, notice&#xD;
what the mark is," said the chief.&#xD;
This order was obeyed.&#xD;
"Now, Mr. Rountree, will you please clean the&#xD;
handle of that knife as well as you can ?"&#xD;
This order was also obeyed.&#xD;
"Examine the knife carefully, and see if you find&#xD;
any marks upon it," said the chief.&#xD;
"I do sir," said Rountree.&#xD;
"What ?" said the chief.&#xD;
"The letters 'iR. S.' cut in rather a curious style."&#xD;
"Are, you sure ?" said the chief.&#xD;
"I am, sir," replied Rountree.&#xD;
"Baker, put your mark also upon that knife."&#xD;

&#xD;
ON the afternoon of the same day the coffin was&#xD;
exhumed, the following conversation occurred at&#xD;
the law office of J. S. Taylor, Esquire.&#xD;
"There is not sufficient testimony upon which to&#xD;
arrest James  ordaunt; but I think we had better&#xD;
immediately arrest Robert Shank, and charge him&#xD;
with the murder of John Furnace," said Mr..Taylor.&#xD;
"What is your opinion, Mr. Mortimer ?"&#xD;
"Too soon. Strike when the iron is hot, not be-&#xD;
fore," replied Mr. Mortimer.  "Our friend there,&#xD;
Chief M    1, has set on foot an investigation which&#xD;
must consume time, but which will, doubtless, event-&#xD;
ually result in obtaining some further valuable testi-&#xD;
mony."&#xD;
"Yes, it will take time, as I have given orders for&#xD;
every unelertaker in New York to be brought to ex-&#xD;
amine the box and coffin, with the hope that we may&#xD;
find some one who can identify it."&#xD;
"In that case, you ,will have to watch this Shank&#xD;
with great care," suggested Mr. Taylor.&#xD;
"Better run that risk than have him escape for&#xD;
want, of testimony. He can't be tried but once for&#xD;
the same offence," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;

"He will find it impossible to escape from an&#xD;
arrest, unless his suspicions are aroused," said tbe&#xD;
chief..&#xD;
"It appears to me safe to arrest him," suggested&#xD;
Mr. Thomas Griswold, who had also been invited&#xD;
to attend this council.&#xD;
"You are correct, Mr. Griswold, so far as Robert&#xD;
Shank is concerned; but you will doubtless perceive&#xD;
that Shank's arrest will put the greater game on&#xD;
guard. It will be a difficult task to connect James&#xD;
JMordaunt with the murder of John Furnace if his&#xD;
suspicions are aroused. He will not rest easy when&#xD;
Shank is arraigned for the murder which he planned,"&#xD;
said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
" I agree with you, Mr. Mortimer," said Mr.&#xD;
Taylor.&#xD;
" Mr. Mortimer's advice is best," said Mr. Gris-&#xD;
wold. "What say you, Chief M    1 '"&#xD;
"For a still weightier reason, Mr. Mortimer's ad-&#xD;
vice seems to me best to be followed, gentlemen.&#xD;
Mr. Griswold, did your father's house burn a few&#xD;
days before Mr. Griswold's failure ?" asked the chief.&#xD;
"r It daid, -sir."&#xD;
"Then it is more than probable that Robert Shank&#xD;
is the incendiary who kindled that fire," said the&#xD;
chief. If we can trace Shank that night, we may ob-&#xD;
tain another important circumstance in this chain of&#xD;
ep*idence. I have heard that one of the fire com-&#xD;
panies elected you as an honorary member of their&#xD;
company, for your good qualities, as a bold man, on&#xD;

A Smash-up in Broadway, N. Y.-The New York Hospital-The Nev&#xD;

WmLE the indefatigable chief of police is endeavor-&#xD;
ing to unravel the tangled web of crime, woven by&#xD;
Jamies IMordaunt, we must ask the reader to go with&#xD;
us once more to No.- Twenty-third street, where the&#xD;
body of Sarah E. Graham, at the dead of night, lies&#xD;
senseless upon the floor in the second story front room&#xD;
of the house. The very carpet that the beautiful girl&#xD;
had- selected and paid for out of money furnished by&#xD;
the fiend who had strike her down, was now absorb-&#xD;
ing her blood as it oozed from a ghastly wound upon&#xD;
her head. Now and then a sudden tremor or spasm&#xD;
ran through the frame of the prostrate body, causing&#xD;
a shudder to creep through the nerves of her de-&#xD;
stroyer. It was not like the shudder of fear, easily&#xD;
dispelled by aid of a determined will; it was the&#xD;
cold, creeping horror, freezing the pulse, and making&#xD;
the heart to hear the echo of its beating with fearful&#xD;
distinctness. For several minutes, James Mordaunt&#xD;
tood a if transfixed with terror, gazing upon his vic-&#xD;
tim. At last, by a great effort, he roused himself for&#xD;
.thenext act in the tragedy. Going to the door;e&#xD;
called Shank. The, tone of his voice sounded so un-&#xD;
&#xD;
natural that he himself was frightened..Shan's.&#xD;
entrance into the room; even to. the man of learning,&#xD;
power, and position, was a relief. 3 The sympathy of a&#xD;
hardened villain, whose arms were steeped in huma.&#xD;
blood, was then most welcome.&#xD;
"What ! you hain't done for her I". exclaimed&#xD;
Shank.&#xD;
"She drew a pistol on me," said Mordaunt, thus&#xD;
defaming the character of poor Sarah by a black&#xD;
falsehood to palliate his guilt before Shank.-&#xD;
"She shouldn't a' done that. Didn't know that&#xD;
folks must defend their lives, did she ?" said Shank.&#xD;
" I seized her barely in time," said Mqrdaunt.&#xD;
" Wal, she's .done for," said Shank; "and now,&#xD;
what's the orders? It won't do to leave her in this&#xD;
spot.&#xD;
"Of course not," replied Mordaunt.&#xD;
"What do you propose? I ain't good at a plan;&#xD;
but I ken do the work,.as you know, counsellor,&#xD;
said Shank, putting on a patronizing smile, which&#xD;
now was received by Mordaunt without the least&#xD;
feeling of wounded self-love. Interest had suddenly&#xD;
instilled into his mind equality of feeling, as well as&#xD;
equality of dissimulation. He grasped Shank's had,&#xD;
and shaking it warmly, said:&#xD;
"]Mr. Shank, you hgve a noble soul. I have never&#xD;
fully appreciated your worth until now. Conima&#xD;
minds ray' become intimate in friendship, on short&#xD;
acquaintance ;' but it has taken a good many tirring&#xD;
deeds to bring us-together."&#xD;
"That's bin the case with you towards me,&#xD;
si re but I've read you quicker. I'se been your&#xD;
friend, and was bound you should know me. 'Tai't&#xD;

to be'spected a man of all your laming should like a&#xD;
min like me, 'til you know'd I was worth sumthin'.&#xD;
It's all right now, squire. We ken hey any amount&#xD;
ov confidence in each other, 'cause we knows one&#xD;
another," said Shank.&#xD;
After a number of plans for disposing of the body&#xD;
had been offered and duly discussed, one suggested&#xD;
by Shank was adopted. Shank accompanied Mor-&#xD;
daunt to his aunt's house. Mordaunt there gave&#xD;
him a disguise of a. French gentleman, a dress&#xD;
which he had formerly used at a masquerade. In&#xD;
this dress, Shank went to a livery stable, and hired an&#xD;
open buggy.with two fast horses, ordering it to be sent&#xD;
to one of the principal hotels.&#xD;
As Shank received the reins from the hostler, he&#xD;
tossed him a French gold piece, which made the eyes&#xD;
of the man glisten with pleasure. As he walked into&#xD;
the stable of his employer, a half hour after, he in-,&#xD;
formed a jockey in waiting,'" as how the Frinch gin-.&#xD;
tlemin was a gintlemin, faith ; fur he gin me a raal&#xD;
goold pace."&#xD;
The coin was duly examined over and over, but&#xD;
finally it was pronounced genuine. It was now&#xD;
nearly half-past two in, the morning. Sarah's cloth-&#xD;
ing was duly arranged. The bonnet was not tied&#xD;
on, but only carelessly placed on her head. She was&#xD;
then put into the carriage, and Shank took his seat&#xD;
"Good-night, sir," said Shank, as he drove off.&#xD;
"Goodnight, monsieur," said Atordaunt. "I hope&#xD;
to see you and your estimable lady again oon.1'&#xD;
he estimable lady did not seen to- appreciate the&#xD;
compliment. Mordaunt then entered the house and&#xD;
&#xD;
set to work, removing all traces -of blood.        He cut&#xD;
out the part of the      carpet that was stained, and&#xD;
burned it; determining to have every piece of furni-&#xD;
ture in the house sold as soon as possible, and to let&#xD;
the building. He accomplished both ; but just before&#xD;
the bustle of removal, the carpet, which was cut, had&#xD;
been quietly abstracted by Shank, and properly&#xD;
taken care of.&#xD;
On the morning after these terrible events in the&#xD;
history of James Mordaunt, the New             York   press&#xD;
contained announcements of a frightful run-away in&#xD;
Broadway.      The following, taken from      the columns&#xD;
of the Daily -     -is a specimen of the whole.&#xD;
FRIGHTFUL ACCIDENT.&#xD;
A-FEMALE TERRLBLY BRUISED!&#xD;
SCENE AT THE CITY HOSPITAL.&#xD;
DIFFICULT OPERATION PERFORMED WITH&#xD;
COMPLETE SUCCESS, BY DR. ----!&#xD;
HOPES FOR HE&amp;amp; RECOVERY.&#xD;
"At about three o'clock this morning, two horses, attached to alight&#xD;
buggy, were discovered running down Broadway at a frightful speed.&#xD;
A lady was in the buggy. The street being almost deserted, the&#xD;
horses had a fair field. When nearly opposite Canal street, they ran&#xD;
into a carriage which had commenced to cross Broadway ; a general&#xD;
smash-up ensued. The lady was thrown out; the driver of the&#xD;
carriage run into, had his arm broken; the carriages were badly&#xD;
injured; one of the horses crossing the street, was killed upon the&#xD;
spot; a second received a frightful gash upon his right fore quarter,&#xD;
which extended down his leg to the knee joint. All the horses were&#xD;
thrown to the ground. The driver and the lady were both taken up&#xD;
senseless, and conveyed immediately to the City Hospital. But little&#xD;
hopes are entertained that the lady will recover. As yet, her friends&#xD;
have not appeared, consequently her name is unknown, as sheis&#xD;
unle to speak. Around her neck was a silken cord, attached to&#xD;
whichis a smallminiature-bearing upon the back the name, .Louia&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7805-00000129"/>&#xD;
.. 0raham." The miniature is evidently intended for some friend,&#xD;
perhaps the mother of the injured woman. There can be little doubt'&#xD;
but that her friends will visit her, when they hear of the accident.&#xD;
P. S.-As we go to press we learn that the buggy was hired in&#xD;
Fourth Avenue ly a Frenchi gentleman. What is very eia able,&#xD;
he cannot now be found; but the owner of the carriage has received,&#xD;
through the mail, a letter containing three hundred dollars in bills,&#xD;
upon different banks. The Frenchman gave the hostler a gold piece&#xD;
at the hotel, but, as appears by the statements of the proprietor of the&#xD;
hotel, no such person was boarding with him."&#xD;
For several weeks, Sarah Graham lay unconscious&#xD;
of the   anxiety which the physicians and         nurses&#xD;
attached to the New York Hospital felt in her behalf.&#xD;
The very mystery which surrounded her--no friends&#xD;
-no relatives ; evidently one accustomed to a luxu-&#xD;
rious home, but deserted by those who should pi-otect&#xD;
her; suspicions aroused that she might prove to be&#xD;
one of the many thousand females, living in New&#xD;
York, who have forgotten the path of virtue ; all&#xD;
these circumstances tended to- attract especial atten-&#xD;
tion to her.&#xD;
Bat how terrible was the anxiety which filled the&#xD;
mind of James Mordaunt ; his victim         was beyond&#xD;
his grasp unless he could compass her death by cor-&#xD;
rupting some employed at the hospital.      At any hour&#xD;
lhe might wake up to consciousness, and then--e&#xD;
vas no longer safe upon his native soil.&#xD;
" She must die !" said the unhappy man, with&#xD;
terrible energy, as he paced his room, having left the&#xD;
dilow which no longer relieved his toi-worn body.&#xD;
Hour after hour, James Mordaunt waited for the&#xD;
coming day. And the day came; but still thevision&#xD;
of Sarah Graham      haunted an imp agination heated&#xD;
almost to frenzy.    She rase before him      from   her&#xD;

couch of suffering, an avenging spectre. The long,&#xD;
blood-stained bandages surrounded her head, her&#xD;
glossy full curls no longer formed a dark back-&#xD;
ground, upon which* to throw in relief the lustrous,&#xD;
soul-bearing eye. The skillful hand of a'good Sama-&#xD;
ritan had carefully, but surely, shaved the proud&#xD;
locks frou- the sick girl's brow; and, oh ! that pale&#xD;
and emaci ted countenance ! How each deep line of&#xD;
suffering carries captive the belief of her hearers, as,&#xD;
with returning consciousness, the stricken girl whis-&#xD;
pers in their ears, bent close to catch each word,&#xD;
"James Mordaunt was my cowardly assailant."&#xD;
And, to that guilty soul the whisper is a knell: of&#xD;
ruin, fearfully distmct; but now, returning night;&#xD;
and then returning day ; no relief I He has no nee&#xD;
to send his messenger to the hospital, that he may&#xD;
larn the progress of her battle with death. The&#xD;
faithful chroniclers of each day's history of the nation&#xD;
did not exclude the cause of a friendless girl from&#xD;
their columns. Each day the eyes of a whole nation&#xD;
were directed to her case; and say not that this&#xD;
watchful care failed to arouse the ambition of skillful&#xD;
surgeons and experienced nurses. Human sympathy&#xD;
may be strong, but human sympathy ever becomes&#xD;
stronger when an honorable ambition hands the&#xD;
wheel.   While there are imitators of Our Lord and&#xD;
Master, there are none of His perfection.&#xD;
Two months after Sarah Graham first became an&#xD;
inmate of the New Yo k Hospital, James Mordaunt&#xD;
was seated in his law omce. Taking up a Umormlg&#xD;
paper; he read as follows:&#xD;
"The young female at the New York Hospital, whose case has&#xD;
excited so much sympathy, we are happy to learn, is now pronotnced&#xD;

out of danger from her wounds, by the attending physicians. Fears&#xD;
are, however, entertained that she will not recover her reason in&#xD;
some years. While the body has conquered death, the struggle has&#xD;
been toq severe for reason to maintain its -throne. The poor girl&#xD;
wanders in her mind. It is understood that, at last, her friends have&#xD;
found her out. A Mrs. Louisa E. Graham, attracted by the published&#xD;
accounts of the affair, has found in this young female, an only daughter,&#xD;
Sarah E. Graham, who left her home, unknown to her mother, about&#xD;
eight years since. This is the first trace the bereaved and deserted&#xD;
mother has received of her lost daughter. And now the daughter&#xD;
knows not the mother. The case is a sad one. Mrs, Graham says&#xD;
she has always believed Sarah was enticed away by a young wood-&#xD;
chopper, at the time paying his attentions to her, but whom she has&#xD;
never .seen, since. Mrs. Graham then resided, and still resides at a&#xD;
small village in the State of Rhode Island. We have learned that&#xD;
sheis very desirous. that her daughter should have the benefit of&#xD;
treatment in the New York State Lunatic Asylum, at the .city of&#xD;
Utica. Her means will not warrant the expense. It remains for a&#xD;
generous public, to decide the matter. Contributions to the fund may&#xD;
be left at this office."&#xD;
James Mordaunt arose from his seat as he finished&#xD;
the reading of this article, and paced his office in&#xD;
deep thought.      He felt that he had gained an exten-&#xD;
sign of time, like a man who has lifted his note with&#xD;
borrowed.funds, and postponed the hour of the fatal&#xD;
protest.&#xD;
The funds requisite for enabling Mrs. Graham            to&#xD;
gratify her wish were handed in to her on the day&#xD;
following the appeal for them.         One prominent firm&#xD;
dispatched the following note to the editor :&#xD;

Bell and Charger.&#xD;
"GooD bye," said Mrs. Clara Griswold, as Bell&#xD;
Mortimer left the cabin of the Cayuga Lake steamer,&#xD;
which she had visited in company wish her brother&#xD;
Frederick.&#xD;
Mrs. Griswold had been , spending a few weeks&#xD;
with Bell at Aurora. To Clara the visit had proved&#xD;
a disappointment. Knowing that Bell Mortimer's&#xD;
happiness was locked within the iron bolts of a&#xD;
prison, she had felt that the pleasures of her visit&#xD;
would flow from sympathizing with her cousin. The&#xD;
result had proved a strange and wide contrast. We'&#xD;
go back to the second day of her visit. It was a&#xD;
lovely morning in April. ,The sun was not yet&#xD;
above the eastern horizon. Two white horses, of&#xD;
almost matchless beauty, caparisoned with the trap-&#xD;
pings customary for ladies., were pawing the gravel&#xD;
walk within the yard, in front of Bell's home. The&#xD;
groom with difficulty restrained the impatient steeds.&#xD;
Soon the front door opened, and Bell Mortimer made&#xD;
her exit, her face radiant with .smiles, and the rich&#xD;
color which health: and the exercise of arranging her&#xD;
riding-habit had given. She was followed by her&#xD;
lovely cousin, Mrs. Griswold.&#xD;

"James, how are the horses this morning ?"-said,&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
"Perhaps, Miss Bell, you can howld Charger, but&#xD;
Misthress Clara had better take Jolly. He's the lad&#xD;
that will aise : up a bit with those little white hands&#xD;
she owns. Whoa! Charger 1"&#xD;
James had no further time to talk, for the horses&#xD;
gave him trouble enough to keep them quiet. Bell,&#xD;
gracefully throwing her habit over her left arm, ran&#xD;
down upon the walk, and seized Charger by the&#xD;
bridle.&#xD;
"Good morning; Charger," said she, patting his&#xD;
gracefully curving neck.&#xD;
The noble animal quickly whirled his body in a&#xD;
half circle, and stood gazing intently for an instant&#xD;
-at Bell, bending forwards both of his ears, and open-&#xD;
ing wide his nostrils. He then gave one or two&#xD;
slight tosses to his head, when Bell again addressed&#xD;
lim:&#xD;
"Charger ! what frightens you?  Do you know&#xD;
Bell ?" Continuing to pat his neck, she began a soft,&#xD;
warbling sound. The horse was evidently accus-&#xD;
tomed to this caress, for he immediately placed his&#xD;
head upon Bell's shoulder, enabling the fair girl to&#xD;
press her cheek softly against it.&#xD;
" There, my noble friend; I thought you had not&#xD;
forgotten Bell."&#xD;
She then took a few oats from the groom, which&#xD;
the horse ate out of her hand..&#xD;
"Why, Bell Mortimer I" said Clara, "how ca e&#xD;
you act soi I should be afraid."&#xD;
"COharger is one of my best friends, Clara," reply id&#xD;
Bell. "Fred says I have bestowedl 11m a&#xD;

upon him. - This is because I am pure of hi M ec-&#xD;
tion. See how he loves me."&#xD;
Tying the bridle to the saddle, so that it did riot&#xD;
impede the animal's movements, patting him upon&#xD;
his head, and repeating the soft warbling, which the&#xD;
horse no sooner heard than he began to evince his&#xD;
affection for her, Bell gave Charger his head, and&#xD;
walked backwards to the carriage-block near the path.&#xD;
Having gained the top of the block, she stood mo-&#xD;
tionless, with her eye fixed intently on the eye of the&#xD;
horse. Charger stood watching Bell with a most&#xD;
intense gaze, occasionally pawing.the ground with his&#xD;
fore-foot, but not for an instant taking his eye from&#xD;
Bell's. She then clapped her hands twice together,&#xD;
-nd uttered the single word-&#xD;
"-Charger !"&#xD;
The animal bounded towards her, and in two leaps&#xD;
was at the block, in proper position for Bell to mount.&#xD;
Before mounting, Bell untied her hat, and laid:it&#xD;
upon the block. She then leaped into the saddle&#xD;
and rode up to Clara, who stood watching her pro-&#xD;
ceedings in perfect amazement.&#xD;
"Come, Clara," said Bell, "mount your horse, for&#xD;
we must away before Fred is up, or he will think his&#xD;
company an infallible necessity to prevent us from&#xD;
breaking our necks."&#xD;
"But, Bell, you are not going without your hat"&#xD;
said Clara; and, gathering up her habit, she started&#xD;
to obtain it for her.&#xD;
As soon as Clara had gained a position between&#xD;
herself and the block, Bell patted Charger ai the&#xD;
neck,,and' reaching her arm forwards with the large&#xD;
end of her whip, she poiznted:tothe hat.&#xD;

&#xD;
Charger instantly comprehended what was wanted&#xD;
of him, for, springing aside and passing Clara, he&#xD;
seized the hat with his teeth.. Shaking his head two&#xD;
or three times, he turned around and stood facing&#xD;
Clara.: Bell: then  again commenced her soft warb-&#xD;
ling, caressing the horse at the same time... Charger,&#xD;
after on or two further-toases of his head, bent his&#xD;
neck in a half-circle, and allowed Bell to take the&#xD;
hat. At this instant, James Mordaunt emerged from&#xD;
the path leading towards the house from one of the&#xD;
front gates. Clara was in the act of mounting when&#xD;
Mordaunt addressed Bell.&#xD;
" That was a splendid feat, Miss Mortimer-none&#xD;
but a fairy queen could subdue a horse to such per-&#xD;
feet obedience.  You must possess some magical&#xD;
powers."&#xD;
" And let James Mordaunt beware how he excites&#xD;
their use to accomplish the ends of justice," replied&#xD;
Bell, directing her horse boldly towards the spot&#xD;
where Mordaunt stood, at the same time bending her&#xD;
gaze upon James, the groom.&#xD;
"James," continued she, "ring the front door-bell,&#xD;
and inform Mr. Mortimer, from me, that James Mor-&#xD;
daunt, Esq., of New York, is in waiting."  Then&#xD;
turning to Mordaunt, she exclaimed: "Good morn-&#xD;
ing, sir. You will perceive I was about taking a&#xD;
ride. Come, Mrs. Griswold."&#xD;
Before Mordaunt could reply, both Bell and Clara&#xD;
were at the gate. Ere he could recall himself to&#xD;
counteract Bell's orders to the groom, the ladies&#xD;
were galloping merrily on the road. He had arrived&#xD;
at Aurora the night before, by the aid of a livery&#xD;
establishment obtained at Auburn.  Having been&#xD;

unable to gain a morning of sleep, he had chosen an&#xD;
early walk. Arriving opposite Mr. Mortimer's resi-&#xD;
dence, he had distinguished Bell's voice, and deter-&#xD;
mined to surprise her. But for Bell's orders to the&#xD;
groom, no unpleasant consequences could have re-&#xD;
sulted. Now he was placed in a disagreeable posi-&#xD;
tion. The bell had been rung by the groom, and&#xD;
Bell's message delivered. In a few moments, word&#xD;
came from Mr. Mortimer that he would be down&#xD;
presently. Mordaunt, therefore, took possession of&#xD;
an iron seat near the front entrance, and began to&#xD;
study an address to Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;

An Aine-Breakfast Ride--The Homestead of an American&#xD;
Statesman.&#xD;
Tn ride from Aurora to the city of Auburn is,&#xD;
full of interest. The road taken by Bell and Clara,&#xD;
for their-horse-back excursion, leads east from Au-&#xD;
rora, by a long and very steep ascent. Nature has&#xD;
surrounded all of the inland waters in western New&#xD;
York with a high elevation of country. We say&#xD;
country, because the face of the surrounding lands&#xD;
is upon a general level with the ridge of the hills&#xD;
leading down to the lakes. Before they had reached&#xD;
the top of this ascent, Bell had succeeded in filling&#xD;
her cousin Clara with more spirit for real enjoyment&#xD;
than she had possessed since bidding her husband&#xD;
good bye at New York. Many a'lazy chanticleer&#xD;
was aroused to produce his first crowing by Clara's&#xD;
merry ring of laughter, excited at Bell's wit, vented'&#xD;
upon barnyards, trees,. cows, farmhouses, sheep,&#xD;
ete, without merey. And now, the young ladies-are&#xD;
about to enter the city of Auburn by the principal&#xD;
road from the south.    Merrily they gallop-over&#xD;
the stony street," passing a 'number of beautifully&#xD;
adorned residences, evincing alike the taste and'&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
263&#xD;
&#xD;
wealth of their proprietors.   Opposite a small&#xD;
park, Bell suddenly reined in her horse, allowing&#xD;
Clara, who had lagged somewhat behind, to come up.&#xD;
Together, they walked their horses past the park.&#xD;
A little in advance, upon their left, were several&#xD;
immense ,poplar trees, relics of that enterprise which&#xD;
characterized the early settlers of. New York, who&#xD;
loved the scenes of the mother country so well,&#xD;
that the forest trees of America became, to their&#xD;
taste, insignificant.  Behind the poplar trees, and,&#xD;
commencing at 'the northeast corner of the little&#xD;
park, and running a long distance northerly, was&#xD;
a high lattice fence, painted green. Behind the&#xD;
whole length of this fence was a dense mass of&#xD;
noble"shade-trees, the intervals between their stately&#xD;
trunks being sprinkled with. fruit trees and rare&#xD;
shrubbery, forming a rural retreat impenetrable to,&#xD;
the gaze of the passer-bf. Standing nearer to the&#xD;
northern line of the copse-like retreat, arose a stately&#xD;
mansion of mason work.    Here and there, a spot&#xD;
upon its front, a part of a shutter, a. corner of the&#xD;
eaves, ora towering chimney were visible through&#xD;
the interstices of the waving verdure. Rising&#xD;
from  the side-walk, upon a line with the fence&#xD;
and directly in front of the mansion,; were erected&#xD;
two square stone columns, each supporting upon its&#xD;
top a crouching lion. Between the stone columns,&#xD;
which, evidently, have been erected to do duty as a&#xD;
support, as well as to serve as ornaments, was a&#xD;
large iron gate. ,Open it, reader ! It has never&#xD;
been closed, by the hand which caused it first to&#xD;
swing upon its hinges, at any calls of benevolee,&#xD;
hospitality, or friendship.&#xD;

"Oh, y," replied Bell; " he is well known to me.&#xD;
His youngest baby was christened under my orders."&#xD;
They had arrived at the entrance to "Fort Hill&#xD;
Cemetery," a ,handsome lodge built with some pre-&#xD;
tension to taste, both in form and style. The keeper&#xD;
readily admitted' them; and upon learning that they&#xD;
had ridden from Aurora, he insisted upon their&#xD;
alighting, and partaking of some breakfast before&#xD;
visiting the cemetery.&#xD;
"No, indeed, Miss Bell, I won't take a no for an&#xD;
answer. You must dismount."&#xD;
Bell was in a perplexity; "she did not want auiy&#xD;
breakfast "-" couldn't eat a mouthful "-1 wasn't a&#xD;
bit tired "--"really hadn't time to wait "-"must be at&#xD;
home by eight or nine o'clocl'-" had left company&#xD;
there" This last excuse decided her. She lightly&#xD;
leaped from her saddle, politely requesting the&#xD;
keeper to assist Clara in dismounting. The picture&#xD;
of James Mordaunt in Aurora gave to the keeper an&#xD;
honor which would have been eagerly sought after by&#xD;
half the good housekeepers in "the loveliest village&#xD;
of the plain."&#xD;
It cleanliness, savoury cooking, rich mocha coffee,&#xD;
a snow-white cloth, and a heart-felt welcome, are of&#xD;
anyvaln e the young ladies did not waste their half&#xD;
hour. Bell declared she had not enjoyed a break-&#xD;
fast before in her whole existence.: Of course she&#xD;
was extravagant in the expression ; but, kind reader,&#xD;
Bell Mortimer was an American, and as such, had a&#xD;
right to use extravagant expressions. It is the nature&#xD;
of the American blood.&#xD;
The young ladies (we have not forgotten that one&#xD;
is married), having again mounted.their horsesbade&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.   267&#xD;
&#xD;
the kind-hearted keeper good bye, and started upon&#xD;
their visit to the cemetery.&#xD;
The first object of interest was a receiving-vault,&#xD;
builtin the side of an immense till, which rises to an&#xD;
elevation overlooking the tallest spire in the beautiful&#xD;
city which lies at its feet. Up this hill, by a serpen-&#xD;
tine 'carriage path, the ladies wended their way.&#xD;
Mount Auburn is the next object of interest. From&#xD;
this spot, the east view of the city 'of Auburn is ob-&#xD;
tained. East, northeast, north, northwest and west,&#xD;
the range of vision takes in homesteads, yards, gar-&#xD;
dens, and streets. The domes of the public buildings,&#xD;
with their metal coverings, reflect the bright sun's&#xD;
rays, awakening in theeart thoughts pure and holy.&#xD;
And towering in mid air, against the northern hdri-&#xD;
zon, is "Copper John."  And who is Copper John?&#xD;
A faithful sentinel is Copper John., Many years&#xD;
have elapsed since, with shouldered musket, he took&#xD;
up his post upon the loftiest dome of the Auburn&#xD;
State Prison. Towering far above the highest wall&#xD;
of that immense structure, he has stood, ever faithful&#xD;
to his trust, grateful for the gentle summer breezes, or&#xD;
boldly laughing at the stormy passions of hoary winter.&#xD;
But, like a watchful sentinel, this, time-server, as the&#xD;
young ladies court his nearer acquaintance through&#xD;
their pocket-telescope, returns all their advances&#xD;
with dignified silence. lie has no moments to bestow&#xD;
upon fair hearts-a confirmed old bachelor is he,&#xD;
mindful that part of his duty is to set an example&#xD;
Of integrity to all public servants. He remembers,&#xD;
co, the extensive interests over which he presides*&#xD;

And, from the position occupied by the young ladies,&#xD;
the size, shape, and extent of the prison appear at a&#xD;
single glance. The beholder obtains a side view of&#xD;
the structure from a distant point, overlooking the&#xD;
top of the walls, and taking in their whole extent.&#xD;
For the purpose of enjoying this view, the ladies.had&#xD;
been obliged to leave their horses in the care of the&#xD;
lodge-keeper, who had accompanied them thus far&#xD;
into the cemetery for the purpose. The name, "Fort&#xD;
Hill Cemetery," is derived from the fact that, within&#xD;
the inclosure are the remains of an Indian fort, in&#xD;
such distinct preservation that its circumference may&#xD;
be easily traced. Upon a spot near the centre of the&#xD;
remains of the fort, a monument, between forty and&#xD;
fifty feet high, built of dare hewn stone, has been&#xD;
erected, linking the primitive race which roamed the&#xD;
American forests, mighty hunters of the wilderness,&#xD;
with the white man, "who has claimed the soil for&#xD;
an inheritance." It bears this inscription:&#xD;
" WI1o 1S THERE TO MOURN FOR LOGAN.?&#xD;
"Clara," said Bell, "we must cut short our visit&#xD;
here this morning. It will not accord with home&#xD;
matters if we loiter much longer."&#xD;
"I am willing to say good bye to the cemetery,"&#xD;
answered Clara, "for, really, Bell, you have chatted&#xD;
me into a state of mind bordering upon anything but&#xD;
seriousness appropriate for this place."&#xD;
"If that remark is true, I take no blame to myself,"&#xD;
said Bell, "because .you have laughed more heartily&#xD;

than at any time in your previous history. ' Charger'&#xD;
and 'Jolly' both act as if they were ashamed of us.&#xD;
They are quiet as deacons handing around the contri-&#xD;
bution plate; but for me to follow the example set&#xD;
by our ponies, would-be rank hypocrisy."&#xD;
Don't you do it, then, Bell; you never could act&#xD;
contrary to your real feelings. I vote for home."&#xD;
"And I," said Bell.&#xD;
The young ladies, thereupon, began to retrace their&#xD;
steps. After reachingGenesee street, much to Clara's&#xD;
surprise, Bell turned north into a by-street.&#xD;
"It will never do for us to promenade Genesee&#xD;
street at this hour," remarked Bell. "We shall be&#xD;
unable to leave Atburn for a week."&#xD;
"We can tie on our veils," suggested Clara.&#xD;
The horses are as well and better known than&#xD;
their riders," responded Bell.&#xD;
At this instant a gentleman endeavored to, hail&#xD;
Miss Mortimer. But she was suddenly very deaf,&#xD;
and "Charger" became wonderfully active, bounding&#xD;
forwards at a racing pace. After leading Clara&#xD;
through several of the by-streets of the city, Bell&#xD;
entered again upon one of the main streets.&#xD;
" Clara," said she, "I must mate a short call at&#xD;
that house to the right. You can be a good girl, and&#xD;
wait for me."&#xD;
"Certainly, Bell, I will do so," replied her cousin;&#xD;
"but ' Charger' will give you trouble ?"&#xD;
"Not in the least. I never tie him. He would&#xD;
break his halter, and come to me,, if I should sing to'-&#xD;
him," said Bell, as she leaped from her saddle.&#xD;
Throwing the bridle over the saddle, Bell patted&#xD;
Charger upon the neck for an instant, and left him,&#xD;

Having reached the door steps of a neat but unpre-&#xD;
tending residence, she pulled the bell.&#xD;
"sthe Rev. Mr. W----; at home ?" asked she&#xD;
of a beautiful little girl who answered the sum-,&#xD;
mors.&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am! Uncle's home! I'll go and call,&#xD;
him."  And away she tripped to do so, and Bell&#xD;
overheard her speaking in rapid tones, almost out of&#xD;
breath' ----&#xD;
Uncle! the pretty lady's come again. She's in&#xD;
the hall-in the hall"&#xD;
"Yes, dear! Not quite so loud," replied her uncle,&#xD;
as be lifted his little niece from the floor, and gave&#xD;
her a kiss'of affection and pride.&#xD;
"Good morning, my dear' Miss Mortimer !" said&#xD;
the kind-hearted clergyman. "I am very happy to&#xD;
see you. You will not be disappointed. May I&#xD;
compliment you upon your bloom?"&#xD;
"Certainly, if I deserve it," said Bell! "I am not&#xD;
afraid that I shall grow vain under compliments from&#xD;
one who is so kind and faithful in laying bare my&#xD;
Faults."&#xD;
But the good man did not apparently hear this&#xD;
tribute to his worth; he was very busy, endeavoring&#xD;
toyfind the key to his secretary. It was soon ob-&#xD;
tained, and the secretary duly opened. From a little&#xD;
drawer he took a letter, the thickness of which gave&#xD;
evidence that its contents were somewhat lengthy.&#xD;
This letter he handed to Bell.&#xD;
Thank you, dear sir," said Bell, "I can never&#xD;
repay this kindness."&#xD;
"dy duty requires me to perform. all I have for&#xD;
you, iss Mortimer, and, consequently, I ai not&#xD;
&#xD;
entitled even to your thanks. Have you any com-&#xD;
munication in return ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said Bell, handing the clergyman a&#xD;
letter.&#xD;
"I can truly say, Miss Mortimer, that the privi-&#xD;
lege of being the medium of your correspondence&#xD;
with George Melville is one of the greatest pleasures&#xD;
I derive from my office, for I have not .a remaining&#xD;
doubt that he is the victim of a wicked plot."&#xD;
These words were like sweet music to Bell. Never&#xD;
before had the worthy clergyman expressed his&#xD;
thoughts on the subject. Bell had received through&#xD;
him, many letters from, and sent many letters to,&#xD;
George Melville. This correspondence she had con-&#xD;
ducted so secretly, that not even her brother Fre-&#xD;
derick knew of it. Soon after Melville's incarcera-&#xD;
tion, Bell had learned that the usual medium by&#xD;
which to send letters to convicts is .through the&#xD;
chaplain of the prison'; this officer being required&#xD;
to acquaint himself with the contents of all letters&#xD;
for convicts, and use his own discretion in regard to&#xD;
their delivery. Bell had made occasional calls upon&#xD;
the chaplain, but, usually, that officer had taken his&#xD;
own conveyance, and made Aurora a visit whenever&#xD;
he had letters for Bell. The ride was a pleasure,&#xD;
and, certainly; the happiness conferred upon Bell&#xD;
more than repaid the good man, had he not found,&#xD;
in addition, that all such attentions were like "bread&#xD;
cast upon the waters."&#xD;
We cannot follow the fair equestrians on their re-&#xD;
turn to Aurora. - Their arrival was a matter of no&#xD;
consequence, except to themselves, for Bell found&#xD;
her home deserted. A little note from her father in-&#xD;

formed her that he would be absent for a week or&#xD;
more.; that he was obliged to take Frederick away&#xD;
also. Mrs. Mortimer had gone to spend the dlay&#xD;
with a lady friend.&#xD;
" Olara, coz, we are monarchs of all we survey for&#xD;
at least one week," said Bell, tossing her father's note&#xD;
upon the table. "Father has deserted us for a week,&#xD;
and pressed Fred into his service. Mother has got&#xD;
on one of her visiting fits, and will expect us not to&#xD;
give her any trouble. I am glad of it: she has been&#xD;
growing sedate for a month past. A few visits with&#xD;
her old friends will bring back the smiles."&#xD;
"I can get along very well to-day," replied Clara;&#xD;
" the ride has been too long, and I must pay the pen-&#xD;
alty by taking some rest."&#xD;
"By keeping up the same exercise for a few weeks&#xD;
you would become another being, Clara," replied&#xD;
Bell. "I shall prescribe twenty miles horse-back ride&#xD;
per diem; half at a canter, a quarter at a walk, and&#xD;
the balance at a trot. You will then be in condition&#xD;
to return to New York and make a sensation. You&#xD;
New Yorkers fondly imagine that a railroad trip into&#xD;
the co ntry; a peep from a carriage at the green&#xD;
fields; by extra effort, one glance at the rising sun;&#xD;
three or four morning tasks at swallowing a half-&#xD;
dozen glasses of Congress water at a fountain; a pic-&#xD;
nic; a few walks in the woods, and, by extraordinary&#xD;
exertion, two or three miles on horse-back; that this'&#xD;
catalogue of labors will restore the bloom sacrificed&#xD;
to a winter's campaign of city life."&#xD;
"You:have given me thirty miles for the first dose,&#xD;
Bell; and as I am   decidedly fatigued, you must&#xD;
allow me to "&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE -MELVILLE.                213&#xD;
"Go and rest yourself, Clara, coz ? Of course I&#xD;
allow it," interrupted Bell&#xD;
Bell was quite willing to make this concession, for&#xD;
just then a letter needed her attention; and experi-&#xD;
ence had taught her that its perusal would occupy&#xD;
considerable time. Clara's desire for rest accorded&#xD;
well, therefore, with Bell's wish to read her letter."&#xD;
"Bess, I do not desire to be interrupted for a&#xD;
couple of hours," said Bell.&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Bell; you's engaged; please call agin.&#xD;
I knows."&#xD;
"That is right, Bess.; be sure and say I am en-&#xD;
gaged if there are visitors."&#xD;
Bell retired. to a small room on the second floor,&#xD;
which she had appropriated to her own use. Closing&#xD;
the door, and turning the key in the lock, she seated&#xD;
herself in a large arm-chair. king George Mel-&#xD;
ville's letter, she broke the seal. Before commencing&#xD;
its perusal, she turned her eye towards heaven. A&#xD;
solemn earnestness took possession of her features.&#xD;
Slowly the hand which held the letter was placed&#xD;
upon the arm of the chair. The eyelids closed ; the&#xD;
rich color of the morning was gone, and a pale white-&#xD;
ness gradually spread over, her face; the head was&#xD;
bent forward, until it rested upon the unoccupied&#xD;
hand, which had slowly risen for its support ; the&#xD;
lips occasionally moved, and a nervousness caused&#xD;
the muscles of the face atintervals to make quick&#xD;
and short vibrations.  But these soon ceased. A&#xD;
tear-drop moistened the pale cheek. Thought was&#xD;
too intensely at work for the lovely weeper to heed&#xD;
it. She was in the solitude devoted to her. by a&#xD;
father's care, and there her tears were sacred. Be-&#xD;

New York merchant to William Hastings, as they&#xD;
were taking a lunch together in one of the thousand&#xD;
dining saloons of Gotham, so convenient to the hun-&#xD;

"yes ;and :now his credit will be better than&#xD;

"It ought to! it ought to! But have you had&#xD;
time to look at the morning papers ?"&#xD;
"No," said Hastings.. " Is there anything very Uin&#xD;

"James Mordaunt, Esq. a Wall street lawyer, has&#xD;
been arrested in one of the western cities. It is in&#xD;
the telegraphic news. That's all my paper says;dbut&#xD;
I've heard a rumor that he is implicated in a murder."&#xD;
This announcement produced no visible effect&#xD;

"Rare, sir! rare! I shall have no patience with'&#xD;
you if you don't bring it rare."&#xD;
Do you know Mordaunt, Mr. Hastings ?" pur-&#xD;
sued the merchant.&#xD;
Oh yes! le lives in  fthi Avenue. Is a man&#xD;
of great ability. Know him well."&#xD;
When ?Mr. Mortimer received the word from Bell&#xD;
that James Mordaunt, Esq., was in waiting, he had&#xD;
not yet arisen from his bed. It was a matter of no&#xD;
small anxiety to divine the object which caused&#xD;
Mordaunt's visit at so early an hour. lie looked out&#xD;
and saw Bell and Clara, as they were disappearing&#xD;
at some distance down the road. He also saw that&#xD;
it wanted some time yet of sunrise. The more he&#xD;
thought, the more Moi'daunt's extraordinarily early&#xD;
call perplexed him. Could it be that Mordaunt had&#xD;
become acquainted with any of his operations&#xD;
against hunm Under ordinary circumstances, he&#xD;
would not have left his room, at such an hour even&#xD;
upon the call of James iMgordaunt; but now the&#xD;
summons was from    Bell.  The servant had not&#xD;
merely informed him that Mordaunt was in waiting;&#xD;
but that Bell had ordered the message. to be de-&#xD;
livered. -&#xD;
Good morning, Mr. Mordaunt! You -are an&#xD;
early riser, said Mr. Mortimer, as he came out&#xD;
upon the front steps. "When did you arrive at&#xD;
Aurora? Walk in, sir; the morning air is chilly."&#xD;
Yes,.sir, I am an early riser, for this morning&#xD;
at least; but I am very sorry to be even the inno&#xD;
cent cause of placing you on a par with me in the.&#xD;
matter.&#xD;
"Well, sir, it is rather early for me; but  fnd,&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE'MELVILLE.&#xD;
usually, that half the battle consists in the effort&#xD;
necessary to overcome sleep.. Once wide awake, the&#xD;
desire to sleep longer departs."&#xD;
"But Mr. Mortimer," said Mordaunt, "you have&#xD;
not given me the opportunity to explain the cause of&#xD;
this early call upon you."&#xD;
"Time enough for that, sir. We have literally&#xD;
the whole day before us, for the sun is not yet above&#xD;
the horizon," replied -Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
Although this remark was made in a polite and&#xD;
gentlemanly tone, still it -left tordaunt in consider-&#xD;
able doubt as to his position with Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
He had last parted with Mr. Mortimer a warm friend.&#xD;
His present visit to Aurora was planned for the pur-&#xD;
pose of learning whether those friendly relations had&#xD;
undergone any change. George Melville had been&#xD;
a convict in the Auburn State Prison nearly two&#xD;
years. During that time, Mordaunt had never neg-&#xD;
lected an opportunity to do Mr. Mortimer favors.&#xD;
His position with Bell, he had learned, in a way that&#xD;
aroused the deepest revenge of his base heart.&#xD;
Bell's, literally, cavalier treatment left him in no&#xD;
doubt as to her sentiments. Her remark, also, way&#xD;
a warning to him. It contained a threat; and, to&#xD;
his experience, that threat was a key to Bell's&#xD;
thoughts. lHe was satisfied she suspected his agency&#xD;
in Melville's trial and conviction. He argued like&#xD;
this: "If she has such suspicions, they have been&#xD;
planted by some other person. Who could that be ?&#xD;
and how had they arisen ?" These questions an-&#xD;
noyed Mordaunt. Again and again he asked him-&#xD;
self, "Am I suspected of Melville's imprisonment "&#xD;
Without answering the question, he said to himself-&#xD;

<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7805-00000141"/>&#xD;

" Let it be so. If the suspicions are strong, I can&#xD;
never marry Bell Mortimer; but I can show her and&#xD;
her father that it had been best not to cross James&#xD;
Jordaunt's path."&#xD;
While Mordaunt was conversing with Mr. Mor-&#xD;
timer, he was silently laying a plan to ruin him.&#xD;
ie determined to corrupt him in his official position,&#xD;
as 4 member of the United States Congress, and&#xD;
tLen, without his own agency being seen or known,&#xD;
to expose and degrade him before the nation.&#xD;
And what was passing in the mind of Mr. Mor-.&#xD;
tiner, as, gazing upon the polite and smooth-&#xD;
tongued villain, he forced himself to exercise the&#xD;
duty of a host? The following was Mr. Mortimer's&#xD;
thought:.&#xD;
"Young man, you would not rest so smilingly, if&#xD;
awaretof the axe which justice holds over your head."&#xD;
Mordaunt, after explaining to Mr. Mortimer that&#xD;
Bell, and not he, had aroused him from sleep, arose.to&#xD;
return to his hotel, declining an invitation to remain&#xD;
for breakfast.&#xD;
"I will bid you good bye, Mr. Mortimer, until&#xD;
after the morning meal; then, I will return and&#xD;
transact some business with you, which is the reason&#xD;
of my visit to Aurora."&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer bade him good mornings saying&#xD;
that he should hold himself disengaged on his&#xD;
account. As Mordaunt left the house, Mr. Mortimer&#xD;
strted for a walk over his grounds which were.&#xD;
etensve. He had proceeded but a few rods, when&#xD;
he was accosted by a plainly dressed, but intelligent-&#xD;
o    ;kg-man, who ha) entered the premises for the'&#xD;
purpose of meeting him.&#xD;
&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
Do I address honorable B. F. Mortimer ?" said&#xD;
the man, politely touching his hat.&#xD;
"That sir, is my name-can I be of service to&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
am the bearer of this note, which has your&#xD;
address; I will request you to read it," said the man,&#xD;
at the same time handing Mr. Mortimer an unsealed&#xD;
letter.&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer opened it and read as follows:&#xD;
OFFICER JEIF OF POLICE,&#xD;
NEW YORK, --18, ~-.&#xD;
""Hon.B. F. Mortiuner,&#xD;
"The bearer (Mr. Patrick E. Doyl) has a warrant for the arrest&#xD;
of James Mordaunt; he has my orders to advise with you in regard&#xD;
to the arrest. I need say no more.e&#xD;
"Your obedient servant,&#xD;
"-'M~&#xD;
"Mr. Doy1, please walk into the house; I am&#xD;
happy, sir, to see that even so -early a riser as the&#xD;
dinguished New York lawyer, does not find you&#xD;
unprepared for him, in case of emergency."&#xD;
This quick appreciation of his faithfulness, at once&#xD;
inspired Mr. iDoyl, who was no less than a deputy&#xD;
sheriff from New York City, with high regardfor&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer. He saw with the quick perception&#xD;
of one skilled in a knowledge of men, that he was&#xD;
in the presence of a practical, far-seeing, bold and&#xD;
honest man. Andsuc     was Mr. Mortimer, whom&#xD;
James Mordaint had now set out to ruin. Was he&#xD;
to succeed-?&#xD;

iNew York ?"&#xD;
"I left the evening of the 6th," was the reply.&#xD;
Why, that is four days since," said Mr. Mforti-&#xD;
mer, evincing  surprise at Mr. Doyl's answer.&#xD;
Yes, sir ! four days since ; the fox I have been&#xD;
tacking has been to the city of U---. He there&#xD;
slowed that he can assume as many phases of person&#xD;
as suits him. He stopped at B- '5 hotel; I set a&#xD;
night and day watch upon him. At nine o'clock on&#xD;
the 7th, he left his room, as hale and, hearty-looking&#xD;
a priest of sixty years' experience, as ever fought&#xD;
against the Pope. This time I was a butcher. He&#xD;
left the house, and entering a livery stable, ordered&#xD;
a horse. and buggy, saying he wished to visit the&#xD;
Lunatic Asylum. It wouldn't do 'for a butcher to gi&#xD;
to the Lunatic Asylum.-he ought to be killing bee,&#xD;
So I just changed into a fine-looking farmer, ordered&#xD;
another horse and buggy, and, with my wife along,&#xD;
was the most curious visitor the asylum had seen for&#xD;
a month.   When I asked the doctor to show me&#xD;
around, I offered to pay, and took out of my pocket&#xD;
a hand heaped full of gold. This little dust threw&#xD;
dust into the doctor's eyes, and he became as polite,&#xD;
and attentive to me and Molly as a politician."&#xD;
"But, Mr. Doyl, how did you get a wife ?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Manufactured her to order out of Jimmy Dady.&#xD;
He can make a good-looking wife in fifteen minutes.&#xD;
He's rather bashful, true--keeps his veil down when&#xD;
anybody's in sight. But, for a foot and ankle, and a&#xD;
pretty hand, he can't be excelled. My wife, that&#xD;
morning, had, a sympathizing soul.  Oh, dear, how&#xD;

she did take on ! It almost makes a fool of me to&#xD;
think of it-"&#xD;
"How so ?" asked Mr. Mortimer, now fery much&#xD;
amused, as well as interested in Doy's visit to the&#xD;
Asylum.&#xD;
"Why, as we were walking through some of&#xD;
the wards, we came to the room which Sarah E.&#xD;
Graham occupied. You remember that unfortunate&#xD;
girl."&#xD;
"Perfectly well, sir" replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Who should be in the room with her," continued&#xD;
Doyl, "but the priest. He was trying the tears of&#xD;
sympathy on the poor girl, at a great rate. My wife&#xD;
immediately went up to the priest, and, in a splendid&#xD;
woman's voice, sobbing under her veil, asked him if&#xD;
he wouldn't have prayers for the poor girl. If the&#xD;
rascal didn't actually oblige her ! - He commenced a&#xD;
prayer which would have passed muster -anywhere.&#xD;
But my wife did take on so -she put in amens at a&#xD;
great rate. When this farce was through with, and&#xD;
while the doctor was telling the priest what a sooth-&#xD;
ing effect prayer seemed to have on Sarah, I ap-&#xD;
proached the poor maniac, and, taking her by the&#xD;
hand, spoke kindly. Then bending down, I whis-&#xD;
pered in her ear the words ' James Mordaunt.' I&#xD;
had kept rpy eye fixed upon Sarah's, to note the&#xD;
result."&#xD;
"And what was it?" said Mr. Mortimer, almost&#xD;
stopping his breath to catch Doyl's next words.&#xD;
"Just what I expected, from the extraordinary&#xD;
effort Mordaunt had taken to visit her in a disguise,"&#xD;
replied Doy1.&#xD;
" how did she act ?" asked Mr. Mortimei.&#xD;

"She looked at me an instant, with a steady but&#xD;
doubtful gaze. Then raising her hand, with one&#xD;
finger extended, she pointed at the priest, and&#xD;
spoke:&#xD;
"'No, sir ! you are not James Mordaunt. There is&#xD;
James Mordaunt. He has grown old. Where am&#xD;
I?   ;What is the matter with met'&#xD;
"Hearing these sentences, the doctor, who had&#xD;
accompanied us, immediately ordered the room to be&#xD;
cleared, himself remaining with Sarah."&#xD;
"And did you watch the effect of her words on&#xD;
Mordaunt ?" asked Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"I turned to him the instant she began to point at&#xD;
him.. He started,but only for a single instant. The&#xD;
next, he wore the same expression of countenance,&#xD;
looking upon Sarah with a sad and sympathizing&#xD;
gaze. He is the most skillful actor I ever tracked.&#xD;
He may be able to get around me; but if he beats.&#xD;
Jimmy Dady, I'll give up tracking scoundrels. Last&#xD;
night, after we arrived at the hotel, Jimmy actually&#xD;
begged a two-shilling bit from him, in the character&#xD;
of an old woman. This morning, when he got up&#xD;
for a walk, he got a sixpence from him for blacking&#xD;
his boots, which the porter blacked."&#xD;
" Mr. Doyl, you will get your, promotion if this&#xD;
niatter shall result in obtaining James Mordaunt's&#xD;
conviction," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
" According to my orders, I am to take your ad-&#xD;
vice inregard to the arrest. I report myself to you,&#xD;
therefore, Mr. Mortimer, and am ready'to act accord-&#xD;
ing to your directions."&#xD;
" That means, Mr. Doyl, do I think it time to&#xD;
make the arrest? The chief of police, in your city,&#xD;
&#xD;
promised not to arrest Mordaunt until he had my&#xD;
advice, unless it became an imperative duty. My&#xD;
orders are as follows: Send Dady to Auburn. Or-&#xD;
der him to telegraph Chief M--1 to be in Utica on&#xD;
the 12th. Mordaunt will be here to-day. Follow him&#xD;
here. You can enter the house by the side-door.&#xD;
This will enable you not to lose sight of him. He&#xD;
will, doubtless, return to New York to-morrow. If&#xD;
he should do so, arrest him at Utica. If he should&#xD;
not take to-morrow's train for the East, arrest him in&#xD;
Auburn.. I shall accompany you to Utica."&#xD;
At about nine o'clock, Mordaunt returned to Mr.&#xD;
Mortimr's residence. He could detect no change in&#xD;
the manner of his reception. Allwas the cordiality&#xD;
of true hospitality. . Mordaunt gradually turned the&#xD;
conversation upon Bell. His object was merely to&#xD;
test Mr. Mortimer's esteem and friendship. Had it&#xD;
not been that the mind he now played with was&#xD;
equal to his own, this feint would have unmasked&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer's real sentiments. But, even on this&#xD;
subject, Mordaunt could detect no change in the&#xD;
regard shown him. If there was any perceptible&#xD;
difference, it consisted in the exhibition of a warmer&#xD;
esteem for him, and a firmer determination tp bring&#xD;
about the marriage. The world will call this dis-&#xD;
simulation. So we name it. Mr. Mortimer knew&#xD;
the man he dealt with, and resolved to meet him at&#xD;
his own game.    Mordaunt had calculated badly&#xD;
when he informed Mr. Mortimer that the object of&#xD;
his visit at Aurora was connected solely with matters&#xD;
of business. The; business was important, but it&#xD;
could have been accomplished without the trouble&#xD;
of a trip to Aurora.&#xD;

"I am tired of city life, Mr. Mortimer," said Mor-&#xD;
daunt, as he was about taking his departure. "This&#xD;
trip to Aurora has been full of pleasure. Ere long,&#xD;
I shall adopt your plan for a home."&#xD;
"Capital! capital, Mr. Mordaunt! Come to Au-&#xD;
rora. Nothing equal to it in the Empire State," said&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Is there land enough for new-comers ?" asked&#xD;
Mordaunt.&#xD;
"Plenty, sir," replied Mr. Mortimer. "I may&#xD;
have an opportunity, as well as a strong desire, to&#xD;
select a habitation for you yet."&#xD;
"I can rely on your advice with perfect safety,&#xD;
sir," replied Mordaunt, completely deceived in his&#xD;
estimate of Mr. Mortimer's real sentiments towards&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"'You can, sir ! you can ! I should not forget my&#xD;
own interest in making the selection. My daughter's&#xD;
happiness would be at stake, as well as your com-&#xD;
fort. Depend upon it, I shall yet have a hand in&#xD;
arranging' your home. Bell will soon do as I wish.&#xD;
We already agree better than heretofore."&#xD;
For an instant, Mordaunt suspected the truth, as&#xD;
this last remark fell from Mr. Mortimer. He re-&#xD;
called Bell's threat, and asked himself whether there&#xD;
might not be a double meaning attached to the&#xD;
words. ' The next remark, however, dissipated his&#xD;
suspicion.&#xD;
"1Bell scarcely ever alludes to George Melville in&#xD;
my presence. She always has a kind word for me&#xD;
when I speak of you," continued Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
Mordaunt was now satisfied that Mr. Mortimer&#xD;
was only blind to Bell's real intentions; that Bell&#xD;
&#xD;
did not make him a partner in her thoughts, and&#xD;
that he himself was farther than ever from obtaining&#xD;
the hand of Bell Mortimer.. Again he resolved to&#xD;
humble Bell Mortimer by filching her father's good&#xD;
name.&#xD;

" Very well, sir," replied Johnson.&#xD;
"Melville," continued the contractor, "I want&#xD;
you to draw a draft for a new steam-engine. I&#xD;
have an order, directing me to make the most&#xD;
powerful engine I can for a particular space. There&#xD;
is only a certain amouiit of room to be occupied,&#xD;
boiler, engine, and all. I have made a draught,&#xD;
but am satisfied it is not right. You'll find&#xD;
mine on the desk. There is. an engine there now&#xD;
in operation, and this is designed. to supply its&#xD;
place."&#xD;
Melville laid down his tools, which were imme-&#xD;
diately resumed by Johnson.  Going to a kid, he&#xD;
washed hishands and set about drawing the plan. The&#xD;
problem would be of little difficulty in a case where&#xD;
the engine required was one of small power. But in&#xD;
this case, an awkward shape to the boiler, the x&#xD;
est possible power,, consistent with safety, ;a eodn+&#xD;
venience for the firemen in feeding and  eping the&#xD;
engine in order, were the difficulties to be overcome.&#xD;

&#xD;
The machinery dependent upon this engine for power&#xD;
was connected with one of the largest factories in the&#xD;
State of New York. Two engines had been made&#xD;
for the purpose, and both failed in reaching the&#xD;
required power. It became a question with the&#xD;
company whether they should be obliged to mar the&#xD;
beauty and symmetry of the plan upon which their&#xD;
factory had- been built by tearing away the outside&#xD;
wall and extending the engine-room, or solving the&#xD;
problem affirmatively, whether an engine, adequate&#xD;
to their wants, could be constructed, which their&#xD;
engine-room, as it was, would contain. The contrac&#xD;
tor had received a conditional order. The company&#xD;
would not bind themselves to take the engine unless&#xD;
it answered their purpose. The power necessary to&#xD;
run the machinery, of course, was among the quali-&#xD;
ties required.&#xD;
The contractor, having set Melville at work upon&#xD;
the problem, was suddenly called away from Auburn.&#xD;
He did not return under several days. Melville&#xD;
made out three plans, each upon different bases,&#xD;
either one of which, on paper, answered the problem&#xD;
satisfactorily.  One of the plans, however, was so&#xD;
clearly the best, that he destroyed the others. He&#xD;
gained by the reserved plan about a quarter more&#xD;
power than would ever be needed. This multiplied&#xD;
the chances of safety by as much as it lessened the&#xD;
expansive force of steam required in the boiler to&#xD;
the square inch.&#xD;
When the contractor returned, the first matter&#xD;
which occupied his attention was this plan. Melville&#xD;
was busily engaged finishing an intricate piece of&#xD;
work, when the contractor entered the shop.&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Melville," said he, "did you succeed with that&#xD;
problem I gave you the other day 2"&#xD;
a I think so, sir," replied Melville.&#xD;
"Let me     see your work," continued the con-&#xD;
tractor.&#xD;
Melville went to the keeper's * desk, and asked&#xD;
him for his plan.&#xD;
The contractor examined it, attentively for some&#xD;
time. He then asked several questions, all of which&#xD;
were answered satisfactorily by Melville.&#xD;
"Very well, sir; I believe you've hit it," said the&#xD;
contractor. "'You gain a quarter more power than&#xD;
necessary. My plan gains but one-sixteenth, except&#xD;
by increasing the pressure. It is something of a&#xD;
trick to build that engine, Melville.&#xD;
"I know that, sir; but I can do it."&#xD;
" You shall have the privilege of trying it, then,&#xD;
Melville.   You shall boss the job throughout. I'll&#xD;
write to-day, accepting the conditions of the order.&#xD;
Go and ask Johnson to come here, if he is not too&#xD;
busy."&#xD;
"Johnson," said the contractor, addressing the&#xD;
assistant-foreman, "I wish Melville to superintend&#xD;
the construction of that engine. Give him all the&#xD;
assistance he shall require, and let me have the&#xD;
engine in running order as soon as possible."&#xD;
." Yes, sir," said the foreman.&#xD;
* We should here inform the reader, that every workshop in&#xD;
the Auburn State Prison has one, two, or three keepers,, according to&#xD;
its extent, who are responsible to the agent or principal keeper for&#xD;
the good conduct of the- convicts. They are in the employ of the&#xD;

XLII.&#xD;
A Ray of Hope.'&#xD;
THE day subsequent to the events detailed in the&#xD;
last chapter was Tuesday. A more lovely morning&#xD;
could scarcely have been planned, except by the&#xD;
Great Mechanic. It was about nine o'clock. George&#xD;
Melville had commenced his preparations for con-&#xD;
structing one of the largest steam-engines, as well as&#xD;
one most difficult to build, which had ever been&#xD;
manufactured in the prison. The contractor had&#xD;
determined to leave Melville entirely'to his own judg-&#xD;
ment, knowing him so well, that in any matters about&#xD;
which he was uncertain, he would obtain all the infor-&#xD;
iation necessary to complete success. During the&#xD;
two years, Melville had been in the prison, he had&#xD;
evinced a most extraordinary aptitude for mechanics.&#xD;
He was now a skillful workman in the machine shop,&#xD;
and had shown himself to be a master of the laws&#xD;
which govern the construction of machinery.  He&#xD;
was considered the greatest genius in a shop of over&#xD;
one hundred workmen. There were many who ex-&#xD;
celled him in executing a piece of work, but he stood&#xD;
alone, and far in advance, as an originator and&#xD;
inventor. As he was about to consult Johnson the&#xD;
assistant foreman of the shop, in regard to what men&#xD;
&#xD;
he had better place upon the new engine, he was&#xD;
sent for to come to the keeper's desk.&#xD;
"Melville," said the keeper, "you are wanted&#xD;
in the clerk's office. Go up and see what it is&#xD;
for."&#xD;
Melville immediately obeyed the order. When&#xD;
he got to the "keeper's-hall," he was met by the&#xD;
Captain of the Wards.&#xD;
"Melville," said the captain, "follow me."&#xD;
The captain led him through the south door of the&#xD;
keeper's hall into the same apartment where first he&#xD;
had changed his citizen's dress for the uniform of the&#xD;
prison. Taking an ordinary suit of black clothes, he&#xD;
ordered Melville to put them on. Melville looked&#xD;
up in astonishment.&#xD;
"Put them on, Melville," repeated the captain.&#xD;
"Am I pardoned ?" asked Melville.&#xD;
"I shouldn't wonder," said the captain.  " You'll&#xD;
learn all about it in the clerk's office."&#xD;
Melville was soon arrayed once more in the garb&#xD;
of a citizen. The clothes were not equal to the suit&#xD;
he had brought to the prison; but he did not stop to&#xD;
criticise them.  Following the captain, he soon&#xD;
entered the clerk's office. The first to greet him&#xD;
there was Hon. B. F. Mortimer.&#xD;
"George," said Mr. Mortimer, as a tear gathered&#xD;
in his eye, " you have been here long enough."&#xD;
Melville was unable to speak. He gazed upon Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer with a look of intense anguish, holding his&#xD;
hand as if in a vice. Then looking from Mr. Morti-&#xD;
mer, his eye rested upon Frederick Mortimer, and&#xD;
by his side stood Melville's father. Dropping Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer's hand, he threw himself into his father's&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7805-00000148"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
aims and wept upon his bosom. The strong man&#xD;
wept. Then seating himself in a chair, he bowed&#xD;
his head upon his breast. Even tears had not brought&#xD;
relief to the wounded soul. George Melville needed&#xD;
no explanations to unravel the mystery of this pro-&#xD;
ceeding. He read that he was pardoned. He also&#xD;
read far, far into the future. Forever before his eye,&#xD;
in clear and ineffaceable characters, arose the black&#xD;
stain upon his forehead-&#xD;
k# YOU HAVE BEEN TwO 'YEARs A CONVICT."&#xD;
Not an eye in that room was dry-not a heart&#xD;
there but fully appreciated the thoughts which had&#xD;
unmanned the hitherto proud and lofty spirit.&#xD;
" He has set anexample of obedience and industry&#xD;
which will be remembered in the prison for years,"&#xD;
said the clerk.&#xD;
Melville arose. He endeavored to look his friends&#xD;
in the eye. The effort was too much for him. Once&#xD;
more he sought his father's eye, and there the respon-&#xD;
sive love which met his gaze, subdued somewhat the&#xD;
wild current which oppressed him.&#xD;
"George," said his father, " bid these gentlemen&#xD;
good bye. They are all your warm friends. The&#xD;
carriage waits to convey you to your mother and&#xD;
sister."&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer, taking Melville's hand, bent his&#xD;
head and whispered in his ear-&#xD;
" George, Bell is waiting for you."&#xD;
The pressure which Mr. Mortimer received from&#xD;
Melville, and the look of subdued earnestness almost&#xD;
unmanned him.&#xD;
&#xD;
Many-years after this event, Mr. Mortimer declared&#xD;
that-the most unhappy moment in his existence, he&#xD;
had endured when in vain he tried to heal the noble&#xD;
spirit so deeply wounded by the uncertain necessity&#xD;
of human justice.  But George Melville saw that&#xD;
his friends were beginning to suffer equally with&#xD;
himself. Aroused by a sense of duty to them, he&#xD;
approached the-officers of the prison present, and&#xD;
gave to each a word of kind remembrance. As he&#xD;
grasped the hand of the clerk, his eye kindled with&#xD;
a brighter lustre.&#xD;
"But for you, my friend," said Melville, "Ishould&#xD;
have been condemned to a -life of misery indeed for&#xD;
the past two years. To you, I am indebted for all I&#xD;
have acquired in the noble employments of the&#xD;
mechanic."&#xD;
This remark was literally true. It will be remem-&#xD;
bered, that Melville, on entering the prison, had been&#xD;
assigned a place in the hospital. Such a disposition&#xD;
it is difficult for a convict to change.. At Melville's&#xD;
request, the clerk had retained him, contrary to&#xD;
orders, in the machine shop, thereby making himself&#xD;
liable to a reprimand.&#xD;
But we must not detain Melville from the friends.&#xD;
who are anxiously awaiting his arrival at the.hotel.&#xD;
The ponderous gate of the main entrance to the prison&#xD;
stands open. George Melville,leaning upon the arm&#xD;
of Frederick Mortimer, walks forth once more a free&#xD;
man, restored to his full citizenship by virtue of the&#xD;
gubernatorial authority exercised at the will of a&#xD;
sovereign people. The Sovereigns of the American&#xD;
Republic, who know how to mete out swift justice&#xD;
when it is due, are also quick to allay and avert the&#xD;

&#xD;
consequences of an unjust doom. Let the record of&#xD;
pardons in New York State alone attest the truth of&#xD;
this assertion. No country on earth can show such a&#xD;
clear record of pardons, granted upon good cause&#xD;
shown, as can the United States of America. If,&#xD;
occasionally, a rascal is restored to citizenship through&#xD;
unmerited sympathy, avarice, or falsehood, no mat-&#xD;
ter; the American people, notwithstanding, will be&#xD;
united in the sentiment, let the pardoning power&#xD;
remain, a monument of American mercy in pursuit&#xD;
of justice.&#xD;
A carriage was in waiting. George did not seem&#xD;
disposed to enter it. With his usually quick percep-&#xD;
tion, Mr. Mortimer divined Melville's wish. Ad-&#xD;
dressing George, he said:&#xD;
"Would you not prefer a walk with Frederick?&#xD;
Your father' and I will go in advance, and prepare&#xD;
the way for you."&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Mortimer. I have no objections&#xD;
to your suggestionn" replied George.&#xD;
This plan *as adopted.&#xD;
During the walk, Frederick Mortimer gave George&#xD;
a history of the pardon; how it had been obtained,&#xD;
and the new testimony which had gradually come to*&#xD;
light. The subject was sufficiently rich in material&#xD;
for many such walks; therefore, long before Fre-&#xD;
derick shad detailed all that had been done to insure&#xD;
success, they arrived at the hotel.&#xD;
"You have a room for me, Fred ?" said George.&#xD;
" Certainly; and an entire wardrobe. While ar-&#xD;
ranging it for you I was sorely tempted to palm mine&#xD;
off on you, and appropriate yours for myself,' replied&#xD;
Frederick.&#xD;
&#xD;
"In that case, I should not have  allowed you a&#xD;
choice between my wardrobes," replied George.&#xD;
"How so ?" asked Fred.&#xD;
"The appropriation of what did not belong to you,&#xD;
would have given you a clear title to an interest in the&#xD;
wardrobe I have used during the past two years,"&#xD;
said George, his face wearing a faint smile, the first&#xD;
since he had learned of his pardon.&#xD;
"Good! Capital! George, I have a hope for you&#xD;
yet. One or two sallies like that will bring back&#xD;
George Melville I used to know. You dare not wear&#xD;
that solemn face when you meet Bell. She shall&#xD;
consign you to a hermitage, if you do ; at all events,&#xD;
it shall not be wasted on her."&#xD;
But Frederick soon saw that the iron had entered&#xD;
Melville's soul too deeply to be withdrawn suddenly..&#xD;
George essayed another smile, but its glimmering&#xD;
was short-lived, vanishing into the shade of intense&#xD;
thought, which Frederick did not again venture t,&#xD;
interrupt until they had reached the room appropri-&#xD;
ated for Melville's use. Here Frederick succeeded&#xD;
better in his attempts to rally his friend's spirits.&#xD;
When George had again assumed the outward sem-&#xD;
blance of the gentleman, and began to appreciate&#xD;
better the value of the service performed in his&#xD;
behalf, by such devoted friends, a change of feel-&#xD;
ing was soon apparent to Frederick,. who quickly&#xD;
read the real motive which produced it. He had&#xD;
found the key which assisted him.in unlocking the&#xD;
source of Melville's unhappiness, thereby admitting&#xD;
light upon the dark shadows of.his heart.&#xD;
"George," said Frederick.&#xD;
" What, Frederick ?" replied Melville.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Do you know, I would not blot out the events of&#xD;
the past three years, even to bring back your old&#xD;
smiles ?"&#xD;
"Why not ?" said Melville- "looking, up with sur-&#xD;
prise.&#xD;
" Simply because I have something in here," said&#xD;
Frederick, striking his hand upon his breast, "which&#xD;
tells me that without the opportunity, you never&#xD;
would have learned to appreciate what true friendship&#xD;
can suffer."&#xD;
"You have suffered, Frederick-all of your family&#xD;
have suffered, and I"&#xD;
"Can now repay your friends," interrupted Fre-&#xD;
derick, "by acting out George Melville as he used&#xD;
to be,'whether you feel like it or not."&#xD;
"That is true, my friend, but "--.&#xD;
"No&amp;amp; buts can be allowed, Mr., Melville," said&#xD;
Frederick, again interrupting, "for three good and&#xD;
;suflicient reasons. Firstly, I have no time to hear&#xD;
them; secondly, I do not wish to hear them; and&#xD;
thirdly, and finally, and conclusively, and emphati-&#xD;
cally, Iwon't hear them. You can take your choice.&#xD;
Go bacl to prison upon a charge of, ingratitude,.or&#xD;
arouse yourself to an appreciation of plain common&#xD;
sense. I should have thought your barbers night&#xD;
have taken a little more hair from your head. Never&#xD;
mind, there is some comfort in the reflection, that&#xD;
this world is built on the self-sustaining and self-&#xD;
renovating principle."&#xD;
"It is short !" said Melville, -looking in the&#xD;
glass.&#xD;
"'What is short ?" said Frederick, as if he did not&#xD;
understand what Melville referred to..&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why, my hair," replied Melville.&#xD;
"Of course it's short. Same length of your grati-&#xD;
tude."&#xD;
"Come, come, Fred; you have said enough on&#xD;
that tack. I shall not give you cause to complain&#xD;
any longer," said Melville, smiling now in real ear-&#xD;
nest.&#xD;
"No! won't you though? Let me see 1" And&#xD;
Frederick, grasping Melville by the shoulders, and&#xD;
holding him at arm's length, examined his new ap.&#xD;
parel from head to foot, with all the earnestness and&#xD;
importance of a brigade inspector on duty.&#xD;
"Well, sir, will it do ?" said Mellville, amused at&#xD;
the inspection.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, better than if you had been measured.&#xD;
Now we will make an attack upon the drawing-&#xD;
room." ' And, without giving Melville an opportu-&#xD;
nity for thought, Frederick, taking his arm, opened&#xD;
the door, passed across a spacious hall, and entered a&#xD;
room at his right, just at'the head of a short flight of&#xD;
stairs,'on the second floor of the hotel.&#xD;
Melville's mother, sister, and cousin, Florence Mel-&#xD;
wood, Mrs. Mortimer, Bell Mortimer, Mrs. Edge-&#xD;
monte, Clara Griswold and Bess,-formed the female&#xD;
portion of the company within. The gentlemen con-&#xD;
sisted of Mr. Melville, Mr. Mortimer, Mr. Edge-&#xD;
monte, Mr. Griswold, Chief M.--1, Thomas Gris-&#xD;
wold, and WilliamHastings.&#xD;
"I must get out of this, Mr. Mortimer," said Chief&#xD;
M     1, a moment before Frederick Mortimer opened&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"My orders, sir, are strict," replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"The d6or cannot be opened for egress."&#xD;

' I shall appeal to the ladies, then," said the chief.&#xD;
"And I, sir, have thirty days in which to answer&#xD;
the appeal," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"The ladies are not in the capacity of a court of&#xD;
dernier resort, Mr. Mortimer. I appeal to them as the&#xD;
popular sovereigns of this company," said the chief.&#xD;
" The appeal, then, will not be allowed," said Mrs.&#xD;
Edgemonte.&#xD;
"You perceive, my-good friend, I have the right&#xD;
on any side, for judgment has come in advance of a&#xD;
hearing. The case is so clear that argument is super-&#xD;
fluous," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
At this instant the door opened, and George Mel-&#xD;
ville, accompanied by Frederick Mortimer, entered&#xD;
the room. His face had not lost the smile which&#xD;
Frederick Mortimer so skillfully excited. It produced&#xD;
a corresponding reflection from every one present.&#xD;
Such a reflex, acting upon the sentiment with which&#xD;
Frederick Mortimer had inspired him, brought back&#xD;
the real George Melville. It would have been diffi-&#xD;
cult to analyze the happiness in that room, or insti-&#xD;
tute a just comparison as to its degree of intensity.&#xD;
There was the mother's joy; the father's wounded&#xD;
pride restored, to mingle again with _his love ; the&#xD;
sister's petitions at the throne of heaven answered ;&#xD;
the rewarded sympathy of active, energetic friend-&#xD;
ship ; the modest consciousness of success in unravel-&#xD;

ship, basking in the smile of gratitude; the joyous&#xD;
confidence of ripened affection-and now,. these&#xD;
phases of the soul were sharpened to their keenest&#xD;
edge. The work had been laid out upon a ^mind&#xD;
tempered by the promptings of refinement and ed&amp;amp;EZ&#xD;
&#xD;

heal the wounded spirit of a -son, brother, friend, and&#xD;

" Oh ! Fred has been breaking the sad news about&#xD;

"Sad news, indeed, Mr. Mortimer'! ' I consider it&#xD;

Auburn, by the Springport road. Drive very sloww"&#xD;
said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Yis, sir," again responded James.&#xD;
At first the spirited bays seemed determined not to&#xD;
take a slow pace; but under the skillful instructions&#xD;
which James administered, they gradually compre-.&#xD;
hended that speed was not at all required. Then, as&#xD;
if ashamed of such company, they settled into a&#xD;
modest trot. The ride to Auburn was so managed&#xD;
that Mordaunt was kept in sight - at a long distance&#xD;
in advance. Upon their arrival, a telegraph dispatch&#xD;
awaited Mr. Mortimer from  Chief M    1, saying&#xD;
that he would be at the city of U - on the twelft4.&#xD;
"So far so good," said Mr. Mortimer. "I shall go&#xD;
to the city of U  this afternoon. In one respect,&#xD;
I have changed the programme, Mr. Doyl. Do not&#xD;
make the arrest until you hear from me again."&#xD;
"Very well, sirs" replied Doyl.&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer, that-evening, took his tea at the&#xD;
Hotel, in the city of Utica. The following morning&#xD;
he called at the Lunatic Asylum, and inquired for&#xD;
the principal physician.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mr. Mortimer. This is an uex-&#xD;
pected pleasure, indeed," said the doctor, as he recog-&#xD;
nized his distinguished visitor.&#xD;
"Good morning, doctor. I trust my presence will&#xD;
not trespass upon your duties," replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"It will not f'or the next hour, Mr: Mortimer,.un-&#xD;
less I have an unexpected call," said the doctor.&#xD;
"Doctor, you have a patient here in whom the peo-&#xD;
ple became very much interested by reason of the:&#xD;
publicity given; her case through the New York&#xD;
press," said  Mr. Mortiier.&#xD;

"You mean Sarah Graham ?" asked the doctor.&#xD;
"Yes ; Sarah E. Graham. What is her condition&#xD;
now doctor ?" said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"$By the hand of Providence she is restored.&#xD;
Hers has been a sad ease. There are circumstances&#xD;
connected with it of a terrible nature ; but she reso-&#xD;
hitely refuses to disclose anything."&#xD;
"Doctor, I must have an interview with her, and&#xD;
would be very glad if you will be present. There&#xD;
are some suspicions which fancy tells me she is able&#xD;
to make certainties," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
Ihave resolutely forbidden all persons from visit-&#xD;
ing her since the seventh instant. It will be neces-&#xD;
sary that you. call again this afternoon, or, better,&#xD;
to-morrow morning, if you can remain until then,"&#xD;
said the doctor. "I am not certain, however, that&#xD;
an interview with her would be best at present. You&#xD;
shall be admitted if the thing is practicable,"&#xD;
" To-morrow will be best," said Mr. Mortimer:&#xD;
"The Chief of Police, from New York, will then be&#xD;
in= the city, and. I should like that he be present at&#xD;
the interview."&#xD;
"Very well. If I admit you, there will be no ob-&#xD;
jection to one more," said the doctor&#xD;
After some further remarks, Mr. Mortimer bade&#xD;
the doctor good morning.&#xD;
Onthe following day, he called again at the Asy-&#xD;
' u   ;this time, accompanied by Chief M-1. The&#xD;
usual greetings of politeness being over, the doctor&#xD;
ifrmted Mr. Mortimer that he would allow the in-&#xD;
t~rvew; butat- the first caution he should give, it&#xD;
to be immediately closed:.They were now in&#xD;
S vitd by the doctor to follow him. After goingsome&#xD;
&#xD;
distance into the building, which-s an immense, as&#xD;
well as a magnificent structure, they were ushered into&#xD;
a capacious room, furnished with taste. Within a&#xD;
large rocking-chair sat Sarah E. Graham. As the&#xD;
doctor entered, she arose, and, standing by the aid of&#xD;
a crutch, extended to him a warm welcome.&#xD;
"Miss Graham," said the doctor, "these are the&#xD;
gentlemen I promised to introduce to you this morn-&#xD;
ing. Mr. Mortimer, allow me to present you to Miss&#xD;
Graham ; Mr. M    1, Miss Graham."&#xD;
She received them with a smile of welcome; and in&#xD;
a modest tone, asked that they should be seated.&#xD;
"Miss Graham," said Mr. Mortimerg"I am very&#xD;
desirous that you will give me liberty to open what&#xD;
may prove to be a painful subject to you."&#xD;
"I shall not shrink, sir, from suffering, when it is&#xD;
necessary ; but you will doubtless be willing to state&#xD;
the motives which prompt you, before entering upon&#xD;
anything that you are aware will be painful to me,"&#xD;
replied Sarah.&#xD;
" Most assuredly. I am perfectly willing to make&#xD;
the required statement. Mary Wilcox "&#xD;
"Is it of her you would speak?" interrupted&#xD;
Sarah.&#xD;
"Yes. J. S. Taylor, Esq., received a note some&#xD;
years since signed 'S. E. G.' That note is of such&#xD;
a nature that I have desired to inquire whether,' S.&#xD;
E. G.,' being your initials, was not your hand-vht-&#xD;
ing in that note ? In other words, are not you 'he&#xD;
author ofit ?" replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"And for whom do you make this inquiry ?"asked&#xD;

purpose, which I had, perhaps, best -not trouble you&#xD;
with(' replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
What is the other purpose ?" pursued Sarah.&#xD;
"It is not ;because there is secrecy in the matter,&#xD;
that I did not inform you at once ; but from a desire&#xD;
to spare your feeling," replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"While I appreciate your kindness, sir, you must&#xD;
allow me to question you as I may desire," replied&#xD;
Sarah..&#xD;
"Most assuredly-I will do so ; and I will endeavor&#xD;
to instruct.you fully in regard to my motives," re-&#xD;
plied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Will you please state what that other purpose may&#xD;
be ?" said Sarah.&#xD;
"To do so, Miss Graham, that you may fully un-&#xD;
derstand my motives in calling upon you, compels&#xD;
me to ask that you will listen to a lengthy history,"&#xD;
replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Pray, go on, sir," replied Sarah.&#xD;
"Some time since," commenced Mr.. Mortimer,&#xD;
"J.S.Taylor, Esq., instituted an action at law, in&#xD;
order to obtain for a young female, residing in Brook-&#xD;
lyn, N. Y., her rights as the wife of a man, living in&#xD;
New York city, named James Mordaunt. Do you&#xD;
know James Mordaunt $"&#xD;
"Go on, sir," replied Sarah.&#xD;
"One of the principal witnesses," continued Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer, "by whom Mr. Taylor expected to esta-&#xD;
blish(Mary's rights,was Rev. John Furnace. This&#xD;
JohnFurnace:was also a resident of Brooklyn. ie&#xD;
suddenly, and~undervery extraordinary circumstances,&#xD;
disappeared the day before the action was com-&#xD;

&#xD;
GE OR GE MELVILL'E.&#xD;
&#xD;
'307&#xD;
&#xD;
nor has any trace been found of his body. Suspicions&#xD;
have pointed strongly towards a man known to be a&#xD;
tool of this James Mordaunt, as the person who can&#xD;
tell what became of Furnace. The fact that Mary&#xD;
Wilcox's success depended upon this clergyman's&#xD;
testimony, coupled with the intimate relations which&#xD;
are known to exist between the suspected person and&#xD;
James Mordaunt, have caused suspicion to rest upon&#xD;
Mordaunt as an accomplice in the kidnapping or&#xD;
murder of Furnace. It is known, also, that James&#xD;
Mordaunt visited you here on the 7th instant, in the&#xD;
disguise of a clergyman."&#xD;
"But I do not see what should excite your interest&#xD;
in this matter other than a high sense of justice," said&#xD;
Sarah.&#xD;
"This will appear more fully, Miss Graham," con-&#xD;
tinued Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Please go on, sir," said Sarah.&#xD;
"A young gentleman," continued Mr. Mortimer,&#xD;
"has been convicted of the crime of forgery, and sent&#xD;
to the State Prison. His friends, since his trial, have&#xD;
reason to suspect that he is the victim of a plot, and&#xD;
that James Mordaunt is the contriver of it."&#xD;
"What is the young man's name ?" asked Sarah.&#xD;
"George Melville," replied Mr. Mortime;&#xD;
"Is there any known motive which should prompt&#xD;
this Mordaunt to commit an innocent person to&#xD;
prison?" asked Sarah.&#xD;
"There is, Miss Graham," replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
" Mordaunt sought the hand of a young lady who Was&#xD;
engaged to Melille.?'&#xD;
And what is the lady's name ?" asked Sarah.&#xD;
"MissM6,rtirmer,' was the reply.&#xD;

"Then . address the father of the lady in question ?"&#xD;
said Sarah.&#xD;
"You do, Miss Graham," replied Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"It is enough. Gentlemen, listen," said Sarah,&#xD;
raising herself in her chair, and looking each of her&#xD;
visitors in the eye in quick succession. At this in-&#xD;
stant, her gaze was full of ,such. earnest truthfulness,&#xD;
that a feeling of solemnity gathered around the group.&#xD;
" Doctor, how long have I been an inmate of this&#xD;
asylum ?" said she.&#xD;
"Nearly two years, Sarah," replied the doctor,&#xD;
with a friendly smile.&#xD;
So long I' ejaculated the unfortunate girl, clasping&#xD;
her hands together, and raising her eyes to heaven.&#xD;
"Great God! Two years more on earth, and&#xD;
Thou not yet my friend! When wilt Thou hear and&#xD;
answer the lost one's petition for mercy$'&#xD;
Sarah," said the doctor, "Heaven is the abode&#xD;
of justice as well as of mercy. If you have an act&#xD;
of justice resting upon your lips, mercy will not enter&#xD;
your soul until justice owns your spoken pledge."&#xD;
"'then  why has Heaven sealed my tongue during&#xD;
two long years? Answer me not! 'HE doeth all&#xD;
things well.' I will now complete a work which&#xD;
was interrupted by a terrible deed two years ago.&#xD;
Send for a magistrate; not for me, but for the benefit&#xD;
of Mary Wilcox, George Melville, and Miss Mor-&#xD;
tiner," said Sarah.&#xD;
This afternoon, Sarah; you had better take rest&#xD;
now," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
Now! I cannot rest until my duty is accom-&#xD;
plished," said Sarah.&#xD;
"It should be done immediately. The relief'to&#xD;

&#xD;
her mind will be better than medicine," interposed&#xD;
the doctor.&#xD;
A carriage was instantly dispatched for the nearest&#xD;
magistrate. The interval passed in general conver-&#xD;
sation, during which Mr. Mortimer succeeded in&#xD;
gaining Sarah's attention, thereby causing her, for&#xD;
the time, to forget the unhappy wounds which neces-&#xD;
sity had compelled him to open.&#xD;
After the arrival of the magistrate, Sarah gave an&#xD;
accurate and detailed account of her history since&#xD;
she first knew James Mordaunt. She revealed all&#xD;
she knew in regard to Mary Wilcox; described the&#xD;
conversation she had overheard in the closet, which,&#xD;
as the reader has already surmised, had reference to&#xD;
the plot to ruin Melville.&#xD;
"And now," continued Sarah, "the remainder of&#xD;
my story affects solely myself. It is unnecessary to&#xD;
reveal that which affects me personally."&#xD;
" It may be unnecessary, so far as your individual&#xD;
interests are concerned, Miss Graham; but you have&#xD;
incurred an obligation to the public, to whom you&#xD;
are indebted for your life," said the magistrate.&#xD;
"Sarah, do not, if you value conscience, withhold one&#xD;
fact which will militate. against this villain, James&#xD;
Mordaunt."&#xD;
"What he has done towards me is now of no con-&#xD;
sequence. I 'cannot alter my fate by becoming his&#xD;
accuser," replied Sarah.&#xD;
"But you may prevent a second Sarah Graham;&#xD;
or a second Mary Wilcox, or a second George Mel-&#xD;
ville, from incurring a fate at James Mordaunt's&#xD;
hands, equal to, or worse than, your own," said Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer.&#xD;

&#xD;
" He can be imprisoned upon what you already&#xD;
know," said Sarah."&#xD;
"Not so! Miss Graham. It would be a very diffi§.&#xD;
cult matter to convict Mordaunt upon the testimony&#xD;
which we have yet obtained," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
' Sarah sat some time in silence, her countenance&#xD;
indicating a sore struggle between desire and duty.&#xD;
"Not now," at length said she. "I can wait a&#xD;
few weeks, and see what events will show."&#xD;
"Do not procrastinate this revelation another hour,&#xD;
Sarah," said the doctor. "You must see clearly that'&#xD;
James Mordaunt is a villain of the blackest charac-&#xD;
ter, and that justice demands at your hands all you&#xD;
know against him."&#xD;
"Let it beso, then," said Sarah, her countenance&#xD;
showing that a firm resolution had been made. She&#xD;
then detailed the terrible events connected with the.&#xD;
house in Twenty-third street, New York, with which&#xD;
the reader is acquainted.&#xD;
"The last I remember," continued Sarah, "James&#xD;
Mordaurit, as I revealed to him my knowledge of his&#xD;
wicked plot against Melville, seized me with the&#xD;
energy of madness, and hurled me with all his force&#xD;
against the marble mantel. The next thing which&#xD;
I remember, James Mordaunt was standing by my&#xD;
bedside dressed in the garb of a clergyman."-&#xD;
"It was Robert Shank, then, who first seized you,&#xD;
while you were arranging your hair ?" said Mr. Mor-&#xD;
timer.&#xD;
"Shank was the name given him by Mordaunt, at&#xD;
the office in Wall street," replied Sarah.&#xD;
"1Would you be able, to recognize the man who&#xD;
seized and gagged you ?" asked Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes," replied Sarah. "I have seen him on two&#xD;
occasions."&#xD;
The magistrate made out three depositions embody-&#xD;
ing all the facts which Sarah had revealed; one relat-&#xD;
ing to Mary Wilcox, one to Melville, one to herself.&#xD;
The deposition relating to Melville was read to her&#xD;
first. After suggesting one or two 'slight alterations,&#xD;
she signed and made oath to it. The same was per-&#xD;
formed in reference, to the deposition .relating to her-&#xD;
self. The magistrate then commenced reading the&#xD;
third, which related to Mary Wilcox. This, Sarah&#xD;
interrupted.&#xD;
"It is entirely unnecessary for me to sign that one,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
"Why so ?" asked the magistrate.&#xD;
"Whenever the suit instituted in Mary Wilcox's&#xD;
behalf shall be tried, my affidavit will be there, if&#xD;
required," replied Sarah.&#xD;
"It will be necessary for some of these gentlemen&#xD;
to be present, in order to verify these facts, and then&#xD;
the question would arise, why did she refuse to sign&#xD;
and make oath to it ?" said the magistrate.&#xD;
"Tell them it was because she did not wish to&#xD;
multiply depositions on the same subject," said Sarah.&#xD;
"Do you mean to be understood, Miss Graham,&#xD;
that you have already made an affidavit of the facts&#xD;
in reference to Mary Wilcox ?" asked Mr. Mortimer,&#xD;
"I do, sir. It was written out for me the same&#xD;
day I wrote my note to Mr. Taylor. The lawyers&#xD;
never knew the names of the parties, nor did they&#xD;
know my name. I took the paper home and filled&#xD;
in all the names myself. Then I went before a magis-&#xD;
trate and made oath to it."&#xD;

"Where is the paper now, Sarah P" asked. Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer.&#xD;
"It is in the hands of the lawyers in New York&#xD;
who drew it. Iinclosed it in an envelope, sealed it up,&#xD;
and directed it to J. S. Taylor, Esquire, to be deliv-&#xD;
ered to him only, in case they heard of my death, or&#xD;
the cause of Mary Wilcox should be brought to' trial&#xD;
and I not appear in court. Had the cause been&#xD;
brought to trial, that affidavit would have been&#xD;
handed to Mr. Taylor. Johnson, Hasbrook &amp;amp; Miller,&#xD;
is the name of the law firm. They gave me their&#xD;
solemn pledge never to open the paper, but to obey&#xD;
my instructions in every respect."&#xD;
"Well, Sarah, you had better execute this also. It&#xD;
can do no harm, and, may do good," said the magis-&#xD;
trate.&#xD;
"I prefer not to execute this paper at present.&#xD;
Should the. other be destroyed, or lost, I ;will sign&#xD;
and make oath to this," said Sarah.&#xD;
"Very well, Sarah," said Mr. Mortimer. "Write&#xD;
an order upon the firm, telling them to -deliver the&#xD;
letter to Mr. Taylor immediately. I will hand it to&#xD;
them."&#xD;
This Sarah did willingly. When the business had*&#xD;
been all finished, Sarah seemed to settle into a&#xD;
melancholy state of feeling. It was evident ,to Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer, that the revelations against Mordaunt, per-&#xD;
taining to herself, had been made against her wish.&#xD;
He filly comprehended the cause of her present&#xD;
anxiety. It was clear that she still retained her&#xD;
affection for the man who had ruined her. This state&#xD;
of inind he determined to eradicate if possible.&#xD;
Now, doctor," said Mr. Mortimer. "I want to&#xD;

ask a great favor of you. Miss Graham has been&#xD;
under your roof nearly, or quite two years. It is&#xD;
time she saw the beauties of a life in the coun-&#xD;
,try.&#xD;
"I will not interpose a single objection, if Sarah&#xD;
falls in with your plan, Mr. Mortimer," said the doc-&#xD;
tor.&#xD;
"Very well! Miss Graham, my plan is, to write&#xD;
immediately to my daughter, and have her make&#xD;
youa visit here. She can remain until the doctor&#xD;
thinks a journey will be good for you;' then, you go&#xD;
to Aurora, to make my house your home for a few&#xD;
months."&#xD;
Sarah upon hearing these words, wiped awaya&#xD;
tear, which came unbidden to her eye.&#xD;
I must go home to my mother," said Sarah.&#xD;
"Not until James Mordaunt is taken care 'of," said&#xD;
Chief M    1. "If you leave here, it must not be&#xD;
known where you go ; and furthermore, you mst go&#xD;
only where you can be fully protected. I have made&#xD;
up my mind that the Frenchman, who hired. the&#xD;

than Robert Shank, and the three hundred dollars&#xD;
sent the livery man, came from James Mordaunt."&#xD;
"What do you refer to, Mr. M=     l?" asked&#xD;
Sarah.&#xD;
"Have you never inquird how you came to this&#xD;
Asylum, Miss Graham ?" asked the-chief.&#xD;
"I can answer that question," interposed-the doc-&#xD;

XLIV&#xD;
The Arrest-Interview with the Governor of the Empire state.&#xD;
ABOUT noon of the day succeeding that which&#xD;
saw the events recorded in our last chapter, Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer and Chief M   1, stood in the U  rail&#xD;
road ddpot, surrounded by a small coterie of friends.&#xD;
No greater matter occupied their attention than the&#xD;
shrill whistle of the locomotive . announcing the&#xD;
approach of a western train.&#xD;
" There is the train," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
" You had better return to the hotel," said Mr.&#xD;
M-1.&#xD;
" Very well," replied Mr. Mortimer. "L agree&#xD;
with you."&#xD;
In a few .moments the train had arrived. Chief&#xD;
M     1 stood upon an elevated platform on theeat&#xD;
side of the ddpot. He was accosted by a number&#xD;
the' newly arrived passengers, mostly residents of&#xD;
New York.    Among these was James Mordaunt.&#xD;
Within ten feet of him, stood Doyl and Dady&#xD;
"Good morning , Mr. MA    1," said Mordaut&#xD;
"this is a surprise. When did youleave Ne r&#xD;
"Onthe 11th, sir," replied Chief M' 5=A&#xD;

&#xD;
Doyl advanced within the circle and, taking Mor-&#xD;
dauti by the arm, addressed him in an under tone.&#xD;
"Sir! you are my prisoner."&#xD;
"Prisoner ?" said Mordaunt, endeavoring to shake&#xD;
off Doyl' grasp.&#xD;
"Be quiet, Mr. Mordaunt. Take things as they&#xD;
cone" said Doyl.&#xD;
" By what authority do you make this arrest ?"&#xD;
asked Mordaunt, very much excited.&#xD;
iol handed to Mordaunt a warrant by which he&#xD;
learned that he was charged with causing the death&#xD;
of John Furnace, by procuring one Robert Shank to&#xD;
commit the deed.&#xD;
Mordaunt asked several questions of Doyl, but&#xD;
obtaining answers so laconic and meaningless, he&#xD;
soon relapsed into silence.  Mr. M-1 had left&#xD;
the ddpoto as soon as he perceived that Doyl had&#xD;
understood his signal.&#xD;
" Where are you going with me ?" asked Mor-&#xD;
daunt.&#xD;
":Aboard the train," said Doyl.  " Would you&#xD;
like a dinner ?"&#xD;
Mordaunt gave no heed to Doy1's question, conse-&#xD;
quently;:that official ordered him to take his place in&#xD;
he car.&#xD;
Ifyou behave yourself, you will not be troubled&#xD;
ith the irons until night," said Doyl, as they took&#xD;
theirseats.&#xD;
Di E. M-.1-l know anything about this&#xD;
aest?" asked Mordaunt.&#xD;
I     'didn'tnotice whether he looked on or not,"&#xD;
,J  Do eou act under his orders ?" asked Mordaunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Whenever he has anything to do out of New&#xD;
York county, he is very apt to employ my valuable&#xD;
services," replied Doyl.&#xD;
And is that the case in this matter?" said&#xD;
Mordaunt.&#xD;
You can see on the face of the warrant, who&#xD;
give me the work," said Doyl. ".Shall I show it to&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"If you please, i  said Mordaunt, biting his lip,&#xD;
and most bravely endeavoring to swallow an angry&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
At this instant, Mr. Mortiner entered the car ;&#xD;
but, apparently without seeing Mordaunt, he imme-&#xD;
diately left it and entered the one behind.&#xD;
"By Jove! Chief, you had near got me into a&#xD;
scrape," said Mr. Mortimer, as he opened the door&#xD;

"What can't be cured, must be endured," replied&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
" Of course," said Mr. M  1.&#xD;
The noise of the train, which had now gained full&#xD;
headway,'put an end to the conversation.&#xD;

There is nothing private about the dispatch. Don't&#xD;
waste one of the people's envelopes on it."&#xD;
"Very well," said the governor, pulling a bell-&#xD;
rope.&#xD;
A servant entered.&#xD;
'LTake this dispatch to the telegraph office, and&#xD;
have it forwarded to New York immediately," said&#xD;
the governor.&#xD;
" Yes, sir," replied the servant, instantly leaving&#xD;
the room as soon as he had received the paper.&#xD;
"Now, gentlemen," said the governor, " I wish to&#xD;
introduce you to some ladies under my wife's charge.&#xD;
We must make an evening of it."&#xD;
It was a late hour before Mr. Mortimer and the&#xD;
chief regained their hotel.&#xD;
The following mornings at an early hour, a pardon,&#xD;
-executed in due form, was handed to Mr. Mortimer by&#xD;
a special messenger from the governor. A few mo-&#xD;
ments afterwards a messenger from the telegraph&#xD;
office handed a dispatch to Chief M 1. It read'&#xD;
as follows:&#xD;
NEW YoR, ,18-.&#xD;
CIEFN  -, r--- HOUSE, ALBANY.&#xD;
Endgarm tisfeorurga efhgt.&#xD;
J. V. S.&#xD;
"Shank is arrested," said the chief, as soon as he&#xD;
had read the dispatch.&#xD;
ortimer, taking up the dispatch, attempted&#xD;
U. to read it.&#xD;
"I shall have to obtain the key to that, Mr. M  1,&#xD;
before'I can unlock it," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"lIt is very simple, sir," replied the chief.&#xD;
"Well, Doyl, how has your prisoner .enjoyed him-&#xD;
&#xD;
H I&#xD;
&#xD;
self," continued Mr. M  -, addressing that official,&#xD;
who just then approached.&#xD;
"He acts pretty soberly about the matter," replied&#xD;
Doyl.&#xD;
" Be ready to go to New York by the evening&#xD;
boat," said Mr. M  1.&#xD;
"I am ready at' a moment's notice," answered&#xD;
Doyl.&#xD;
"What is the key to your telegraph dispatch ?".&#xD;
asked Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"I have not got it with me," replied Mr. M  1,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer. saw that his friend M-1 was&#xD;
proof against even his attempts to learn to read his&#xD;
secret writing. As a new order of things has been&#xD;
instituted, and as old things have passed away, it&#xD;
will do no injury to the cause of justice if we now&#xD;
give the key to the public. Read the dispatches&#xD;
backwards, commencing at the last letter, and omit-&#xD;
ting each second letter.&#xD;
That night James Mordaunt was carried a pri-&#xD;
soner to New York. On the following .day he was&#xD;
brought before the officer who issued the process&#xD;
against him. An examination was waived, and he&#xD;
was admitted to bail. He was then arrested upon a&#xD;
second warrant, issued upon the affidavit of Sarah E.&#xD;
Graham. )hen he fully comprehended the fact that&#xD;
she was restored to reason, his countenance fell. Ruin&#xD;
stared him in the face ; and ' 'the event proved.&#xD;
Although he was admitted to bail on this charge.&#xD;
also, and thereby enjoyed every advantage for con-&#xD;
ducting his defence, still he was convicted, and sen-&#xD;
tenced to five years' hard labor in the State prison&#xD;

The suit instituted for the establishment of Mary&#xD;
Wilcox's rights, now became an easy matter. It was&#xD;
prosecuted to a successful termination in her favor.&#xD;
and her clainis upon his property were recognized by&#xD;
the courts,&#xD;
Two days after the judgment of the court had&#xD;
been rendered, the vessel commanded by her uncle,&#xD;
Captain Joseph Horton, entered New York harbor,&#xD;
having been permitted by the health officer, upon&#xD;
due examination of her manifest, to pass quarantine.&#xD;
But was Mary Mordaunt the happy niece, the joyful&#xD;
wife, the proud mother? She had gained. only the&#xD;
first stepping-stone up the steep and rugged pathway&#xD;
of peace. But she possessed a true heart, and a&#xD;
heavenly guide to direct her in the way of duty.&#xD;
The great struggle of a life was before her. She had&#xD;
a husband, and her child owned a villain,lost to him-&#xD;
self, his friends, and society, for a father. She shrank&#xD;
not from this struggle; nor did she fail in meeting&#xD;
wi  hrtndant sympathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
A Mountain in Massachusetts-The Home of, an ex-Presides; of the&#xD;
United States.&#xD;
READER, you approach the conclusion of our story.&#xD;
Bear with its length patiently ! The duty before us,'&#xD;
though for truth's sake we must yet describe a few&#xD;
sad pictures of life, will also present you with scenes&#xD;
of happiness. This world is not always dark, nor&#xD;
does misfortune always surround the poor in heart.&#xD;
You stand upon an elevation of land, covered with&#xD;
a rich forest growth. It is an hour and a half since,&#xD;
upon the level country, you bade adieu to luxuriant&#xD;
fields, groaning under the weight of ripening har-&#xD;
vests. The progress up the steep ascent has been&#xD;
slow and fatiguing. Physical- endurance almost&#xD;
gives out. The rich, mossy bed, so delicately spread&#xD;
upon the outcropping formation, is a genial and wel&#xD;
come resting-place. The tall and stately pine, the&#xD;
graceful elm and beech, and the broad-leafed maples&#xD;
afford a certain protection against the summer's tn.&#xD;
The mind has gradually been filled with wonder at&#xD;
the sublimity of a mountain ascent. For months,&#xD;
mansions of brick, dirty streets, jostling crowds, and&#xD;
the, capacity of a counting-room have been pictured&#xD;
upon the retina. The optic nerve has longed for&#xD;

&#xD;
rest, calling loudly upon the members to allow the&#xD;
pupil an opportunity for dilation in the forest shade.&#xD;
And now the solemn darkness of the mountain has&#xD;
reached and filled, the. soul. The brows, so long&#xD;
contracted, rise with the opening lids. The chatter-&#xD;
ing of the nimble squirrel reaches the ear. The&#xD;
sight, so keen in -youth, in vain endeavors to find the&#xD;
bold climber. Peering into tree after .tree, now cer-&#xD;
tain, now uncertain. "Yes, she is there !"-" No!&#xD;
its a black knot!" How quickly the merry chatterer&#xD;
appreciates the: cause of this exhibition of doubt !&#xD;
Darting into a' hole, she whispers to her young, ".The&#xD;
man is not the boy ! His rifle shines with silver;&#xD;
bnt it is not the old rusty shot-gun he used to carry,&#xD;
which sent the cold lead with such certainty. Come,&#xD;
chicks, no fear !" And now that old monarch of&#xD;
the woods, which has stood the blasts of .a century,&#xD;
resounds with the chattering derision of the whole&#xD;
nest. Bang! Good sir, you have ttd your pow-&#xD;
he nimble innocents gambol upon their native&#xD;
4tmghs unharmed. Come, ascend this stately tower&#xD;
taY t overlooks the tops of the forest verdure. A&#xD;
cene ishere which you may enjoy without prosti-&#xD;
tutingdur sight to the destruction of life merely&#xD;
for pastime. You climb the square tower to its top.&#xD;
Folding the arms, as if transfixed by the magnificent&#xD;
truth revealed, you are lost in the contemplation.&#xD;
Look north! pilesupon piles of mountain heights rise&#xD;
before you. The eye wanders,'along their serpentine&#xD;
indIngs for twenty, perhaps thirty statute miles,&#xD;
until it rests upon what appears a blue cloud, lying&#xD;
against the skin the horizon. A beautiful female,&#xD;
enveloped in the semblance of a riding-habit, with&#xD;
&#xD;
raven locks streaming backwards in the breeze, now&#xD;
gathering up the reins of her steed, her dark eye,&#xD;
crested with brows of delicate grace, and sparkling&#xD;
in the flashing sunbeams, gives back a gaze so steady&#xD;
as to turn your own. But, look again ! The saddle&#xD;
only is there ! She must be the sprite of these moun-&#xD;
tain ranges. Look west ! Following closely, range&#xD;
upon range, for a distance of fifty miles, are stately&#xD;
forests, interspersed with cultivated fields, the whole&#xD;
picture dotted with thrifty-looking homesteads.&#xD;
Along the distant horizon, stately columns of smoke,&#xD;
moving southerly, rise against the blue sky in majes-&#xD;
tic curves. On the left, behind that long range of&#xD;
rolling hills, is a homestead in which i plain citizen&#xD;
may be daily observed guiding the affairs of a&#xD;
prosperous family, with the same industry, zeal,&#xD;
confidence, and success which he once displayed&#xD;
when holding in his grasp the sceptre of the Ameri-&#xD;
can Republic. Look south ! Again the eye rests&#xD;
upon verdure-clad mountains, but the hand of man&#xD;
is clearly visible, exonerating nature from the air of&#xD;
studied exactness, which speaks of the industrious&#xD;
agriculturist. And now, as the telescope is brought&#xD;
to bear upon some of the houses, what strange models&#xD;
of architecture are presented. An intimate exami-&#xD;
nation of these reveals isolation and singularity, as&#xD;
chief characteristics of the occupants. Look east-! A&#xD;
garden, as of a second paradise is there. Within a&#xD;
few miles of each other, are a number of natural&#xD;
ponds or little lakes, forming a circle, from within&#xD;
which arise several spires; as of village churches, the&#xD;
surrounding buildings and rich verdure leaving it for&#xD;
imagination to supply the houses which 'support&#xD;

the circle 6fthat collection of houses, arises a single&#xD;
ehhi, standing like a faithful sentinel, and boldly de-&#xD;
fyingliterally, every blast, as if the Stygian waters had&#xD;
given to it the: power of a Hercules to come scath-&#xD;

ing from that clump of whortleberry bushes. Per-&#xD;
sons are approaching the tower,   Reader, let us&#xD;
descend. Watching strangers from a distance is a&#xD;
more agreeable employment than meeting them upon&#xD;
a platform contracted by the limits of a tower. But&#xD;
noW that the strangers are within sight, there is a&#xD;
decided air about them which reminds us of friends.&#xD;
And so they prove.&#xD;
" Come, Bell, I shall never get my basket filled,&#xD;
unless you help me," said Florence Melwood,&#xD;
" Then you do not deserve to have it filled at all,"&#xD;
repaid Bell Mortimer. " My basket holds a third&#xD;
more than yours, and just look at it. It will not carry&#xD;
twenty berries more."&#xD;
Bell had evidently a very just idea of her friend's&#xD;
industry; for, looking up with an arch smile, she said&#xD;
"Flora, what have you done with your gallant&#xD;
knight"&#xD;
"hy, like a sensible girl, I have ordered him to&#xD;
pick berries enough to fill my basket.  dHe heas&#xD;
givenrme no peace.for the last half hour. As fast as&#xD;
I piced the berries, he would steal them."&#xD;
"Declaring, I suppose, a sweetness in flavor on ac-&#xD;
on:t of thestolen fruit," said Bell.&#xD;
" Yes,1Bell; and d eclaring something else. He&#xD;
&#xD;
.I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
wants to carry offdmother's baby, and I am deter-&#xD;
mined he shall not have her," said Florence, with a&#xD;
half sober,;lhalf pouting expression.&#xD;
At this instant, William Hastings appeared upon&#xD;
the scene. ,He approached Florence, .and giving her&#xD;
a smile which can come only from a true heart, filled&#xD;
her basket with whortleberries, out of a large leaf&#xD;
which was so well heaped that it gave him some diffii-&#xD;
culty to prevent the loss of the wild fruit.&#xD;
"-There, Bell, coz," said Florence,,"you are wel-&#xD;
come to youi- berries now."&#xD;
I shall have to give them to Mrs. Melwood,&#xD;
then, to console her if she loses her Flora," replied&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
"Entirely unnecessary, Bell," said Florence.&#xD;
"And what has Mrs. Melwood lost ?" asked Hastj&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
"The loss, Mr. Hastings, appears to be prospec-&#xD;
tive," said Bell, laughing.&#xD;
"I wish it would prove so," replied Hastings, as-&#xD;
suming suddenly a mock gravity.&#xD;
"'Jest' and 'Truth,' I perceive, have become in-&#xD;
timate once more, Mr. Hastings;" said Bell.&#xD;
"All owing to the necessity of the case, Miss Mor-&#xD;
timer," replied Florence, putting on the semblance&#xD;
of dignity. "If Miss Mortimer would only help&#xD;
' Jest' to conquer ' Truth, she will gain more from&#xD;
Mrs. Melwood than by presenting her with a basket&#xD;
of berries."&#xD;
"Bask at the berries-lamb-ike, of course," said&#xD;
Hastings, seizing a handful from Bell's basket, and&#xD;
assuming a very ilinocent expression of countenance&#xD;
" Oh, sir, you will repent when too late. I cani&#xD;

"Knowing that in advance, I believe in divesting&#xD;
you of the ainews of war," replied Hastings, stealing&#xD;
a second handful from Bell.&#xD;
"You appear so well determined as to your course,&#xD;
I believe it will be the best punishment if I endeavor&#xD;
to hasten the progress of events," said Bell.&#xD;
At this moment, Mrs. Meiwood, leaning on the arm&#xD;
of George Melville, approached the. tower.  The&#xD;
whole party then ascended to its top. For several&#xD;
moments no one broke the silence. The splendor&#xD;
of the view arrested every thought foreign to the,&#xD;
deep emotion aroused by its extent, sublimity, and&#xD;
grandeur.&#xD;

Another Telegram-Early rising sometimes proves very agreeable.&#xD;
WE left George Melville in such good hands, just&#xD;
after his restoration to citizenship, that it is not to be&#xD;
presumed the reader has felt anxiety in his behalf,&#xD;
unless, indeed, it has been excited by an unsuccessful&#xD;
effort to forget the unhappy mistake which a high&#xD;
regard for justice had 'compelled .the administrators&#xD;
of the law to commit. True, the iron had entered&#xD;
deeply, and the wound was ;severe. The bright&#xD;
hopes of friends apparently had been crushed forever.&#xD;
Sad and bitter tears had been shed over the terrible&#xD;
blow. A father's life-long aspirations had been covered&#xD;
by a blackest cloud of deepest woe-making the silent&#xD;
tomb a welcome sight, a coveted haven. The mother's&#xD;
heart no pen can paint. It can be seen only by the&#xD;
eye of'experience, and of Him, the Comforter,&#xD;
"Who, once in mortal anguish,&#xD;
Gave the widow back her son.'t&#xD;
And the sister's unselfish tears! Life had been bereft&#xD;
of its worth to her. But death was not invoked in&#xD;
her prayers. Solitary, she would live and .mourn.&#xD;
And the friends ! Sympathy in trial is one of the&#xD;

good gifts of Heaven; but there are times when the&#xD;
heart refuses to confide even in angel visitors. How&#xD;
little had George Melville expected that the mark of&#xD;
a felon was so soon to be removed from his name !&#xD;
How joyfully the warm blood coursed through his&#xD;
eins when he drank to his fill the knowledge that&#xD;
the friends, whose good opinion he had learned to&#xD;
prize, were none of them alienated. The transition&#xD;
was.great. The prison-shop for the parlor ; the con-&#xD;
vict's garb for the freeman's apparel; the atmosphere&#xD;
of crime, for the genial breathings of truth and virtue.&#xD;
Contrast refuses to acknowledge greater extremes.&#xD;

"eAtelumgraph for Miss Bell," said Bess, as she&#xD;
entered the parlor, bearing a letter in her hand..&#xD;
"For me, Bess ?" asked Bell, rising from an otto-&#xD;
man, and approaching the door.&#xD;
" Yis 'um; man's.a waitin'," said Bess.&#xD;
"Excuse me," said Bell, bowing to the ladies.&#xD;
present, as she left the room.&#xD;
Having satisfied the messenger's claim, she opened&#xD;
her dispatch. It read as follows:&#xD;
U--, i-.&#xD;
To..BELL NORTIMER, AURORA, N. Y.&#xD;
ome to U--; morning train from Auburn. Doctor --&#xD;
wll be at U-- d6pot. Keep your movements secret. Follow his&#xD;
directions.&#xD;
B. F. MORTIMER.&#xD;
'lease wait a moment, sir. .An answer is re-&#xD;
ed, said Bell to the messenger. Then, running&#xD;
up  aimto her room, with which the reader is already&#xD;
familiar, she hastily penned the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE :MELVILLE.    831&#xD;
&#xD;
Aai, N'.  , _  _&#xD;
Will be at -city of U- by morning train.&#xD;
BELL MORTIMER.&#xD;
Having delivered this to the messenger, returning&#xD;
to the parlor, Bell went immediately to the piano.&#xD;
She commenced a series of songs and instrumental&#xD;
pieces from the old German masters, with an occa-&#xD;
sional selection from Rossini, Bellini, and Verdi.&#xD;
The ladies present were so charmed at Bell's music&#xD;
that, ere a half hour passed, she had actually cheated&#xD;
them out of what curiosity a telegraph dispatch&#xD;
would naturally create.&#xD;
That night Bell retired early. On the following&#xD;
morning; long before any of her company had&#xD;
thought of leaving dreamland, Bell entered the&#xD;
dining-room. To her surprise, she found- Bess there.&#xD;
"'Why, Bess! you are early," said Bell.&#xD;
"Yis, 'um. Telumgraph 'spatch 'portant, and so&#xD;
Bess couldn't sleep. What's to be did ?" said Bess.&#xD;
"Go and call James, and ,then set out a cold bite&#xD;
for two," said Bell.&#xD;
" Pshaw !" mumbled Bess, as she entered the&#xD;
kitchen. "Miss Bell's ign'rant oh de commonest&#xD;
principals oh keeping' good looks. She'd kill her&#xD;
health a drinking' cold water in de mornin', ef&#xD;
twan't for me."&#xD;
Bess's first anxiety-was about the fire. In two&#xD;
minutes she had a roaring blaze in the kitchen stove,&#xD;
and the singing kettle, with the "small- drop of&#xD;
water," as Bess called it, when she "sot the kittle&#xD;
a bilin'," sounded very mucl like having a cup of&#xD;
coffee " ready in no time."&#xD;

At this moment James entered the kitchen.&#xD;
"Jims," said Bess, "Miss Bell wants you to kum&#xD;
fur'to see heroin de sittin'-room. You needn't tell&#xD;
anything 'bout de fire."&#xD;
James understood this hint, being well acquainted&#xD;
with Bess's ways. He knew also that if he failed&#xD;
to comply, Bess would pay him off. She was one&#xD;
of the servant kind (indeed few others are worth&#xD;

their wishes respected -by the high and the low, those&#xD;
above as well as those beneath them.&#xD;
"James," said Belf, ".call Mr. Melville.. Say I&#xD;
wish to see him. Make no noise about it which&#xD;
may disturb others. His room is the large one at&#xD;
the head of the stairs.&#xD;
"Yis, ma'am," said James.'&#xD;
Bell's summons, when he had consulted his watch&#xD;
asto the hour, gave Melville some surprise.&#xD;
"However," said he, in soliloquy," there are few&#xD;
sleepers aroused this morning by a bell of sweeter&#xD;
tone."&#xD;
In a short time, Melville descended by the front&#xD;
hall stairway. 4Bell awaited him, hat in hand, at the&#xD;
parlor door. Jdis was the first moment, exclusively&#xD;
their own, since the hour Melville returned to his&#xD;
father's home, after the breaking of his leg.  He&#xD;
took the offered hand and pressed it warmly to his&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
"And am I yet esteemed by Bell Mortimer ?" said&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.               333&#xD;
he. "Such a lovely flower should be placed in. a&#xD;
golden handle, free from dross, which no atmosphere&#xD;
can soil."&#xD;
"Where it would droop and wither by the next&#xD;
morning's light. The flower, when taken from its&#xD;
parent stem, must look to loving hands for suste-&#xD;
nance, if it would continue its bloom., Rise, George.&#xD;
Kneel not to me ! Let us both kneel to Heaven,&#xD;
where the order was given which has restored our&#xD;
happiness," said Bell.&#xD;
For the rfist/time, George Melville clasped to his&#xD;
heart the beautiful girl whose love had been tried by&#xD;
such a terrible ordeal. Bell Mortimer sought not to&#xD;
resist his embrace. Her burning anxiety, grown to&#xD;
be almost ;insupportable, at last found full relief in&#xD;
tears, shed upon the bosom where every drop was&#xD;
mingled with the life-current of a heart beating only&#xD;
for her love. Was this the happiest moment that&#xD;
Bell had yet lived?  If it was not, the next was. the&#xD;
happiest of Melville's existence, as his eye caught&#xD;
the joyous smile which beamed upon him. Once&#xD;
more he clasped the noble girl to his heart, as he&#xD;
sealed his love with the first kiss of affection upon&#xD;
lips which, in waking and in dreams, had breathed&#xD;
his name with pride.&#xD;
The hall-door opened from the dining-room.&#xD;
"I'se wondering I" soliloquized Bess, as she shuf-&#xD;
fled into the, hall. "Miss Bell was in mi'ty hurry&#xD;
fur nothin', and I might' jest as well cooked up a&#xD;
beef-steak coal black. What on yarth's keepin' her&#xD;
up stairs !" Saying which, Bess began to ascend, an&#xD;
occupation which Bell by no means endeavored to&#xD;
interrupt.&#xD;

As soon as Bess was. at the. top of the stairs, Bell&#xD;
arose and passed into the dining-room.  She was&#xD;
somewhat surprised at the aspect of the table. A&#xD;
smoking hot beef-steak, fried potatoes, some cucum-&#xD;
bers fresh from the vines, a plate of nicely browned&#xD;
toast, and a pot of hot coffee, which Bell knew from&#xD;
experience, could not be excelled. Bess was not&#xD;
the cook ; but it was always a proud morning to Mr.&#xD;
/ Mortimer, when he could entrap her into getting up&#xD;
a breakfast for him.&#xD;
"Laws suz, Miss Bell. Where has you bin? Is'e&#xD;
wint to your room and you wasn't thar."&#xD;
"I was in the parlor, Bess.  Go and inform Mr.&#xD;
Melville that breakfast is ready," said Bell, opening&#xD;
the kitchen door, where James was seated, arranging&#xD;
a mess for his horses.&#xD;
" James, harness up the bays, and prepare to drive&#xD;
me to Auburn. I shall be ready in twenty minutes."&#xD;
" I knew as how there was something in the wind,&#xD;
faith. It's well I fed the horses when I giv thim good&#xD;
mornin', shure," said James, as he entered the barn.&#xD;
" It's a cruel pace of bizness, Jack,"to take you out&#xD;
so airly  There's one consolashun ye have shure.&#xD;
Whin Bell is married, George Melville's the gintl'man&#xD;
what'al niver let you be taken out afore breakfast.&#xD;
Mind that now, ye Jack ! Whoa, Bill! There, be&#xD;
jabers! an ye as dhry as a yeast cake. Dhrink! of it&#xD;

"Misser Melville, Miss Mortimer's kompulmunts,&#xD;
an' she'd like you to kum to brekfust," said Bess.&#xD;
" Withpleasure, Bess," replied Melville.&#xD;
" Law, suz ! Misser Melvillb, yu'se no idee how&#xD;
&#xD;
[&#xD;
fn&#xD;
&#xD;
foolish I gits sumtimes. This mornin', I'se dun the&#xD;
cooking' and let the lazy, cook sleep. She paint up yit,"&#xD;
said Bess. " Pooty one, Miss, Bell is. Wanted fur&#xD;
to hev nuthin but cole water fur a brekfust."&#xD;
"Bess, you have really proved your extraordinary&#xD;
talent for an emergency," said Melville, as he carved&#xD;
a delicate piece of the steak for Bell. ' "Please hand&#xD;
that plate to Miss Mortimer."&#xD;
"And I shall be disappointed if that cup of coffee&#xD;
fails to meet decided approbation from you," said&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
Eating was not the order of exercise at either end&#xD;
of the table.  George Melville had altogether too&#xD;
much to admire, seated opposite, behind the rich array&#xD;
of a costly breakfast-set. Bell had more than she&#xD;
could accomplish, to keep down her blushes, excited&#xD;
by the earnest gaze and affectionate 'smile, blending&#xD;
so well with the graceful dignity which characterized&#xD;
Melville's address at the table. She had often faced&#xD;
a crowded breakfast-table in the.capacity of hostess,&#xD;
and without wishing to hasten the ticking of the&#xD;
clock.. Now, she could hear her heart beat,iso quickly&#xD;
and so strong, that the old, clock's second-ticks seemed&#xD;
like minutes, and the minutes became hours. But&#xD;
there is an end to everything, except a circle.&#xD;
" I'se ob de pinyon, dat Miss Bell Mortimer haint&#xD;
ete nuthin',-and dat all Misser Melville's eten is kuf-&#xD;
fee. Jest look at Miss Bell's plate. I'se got nuff&#xD;

James opened the kitchen door.&#xD;

countenance expressing an unusual amount of indig-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
"What you bein' mad 'bout! Miss Bell kin drive&#xD;
better'n you. Come along and ete brekfust. Guess&#xD;
you won't git better dis mornin'," said Bess. "Bell&#xD;
kin teach you to drive."&#xD;
Now Bess would scold and fret at Bell by the&#xD;
hour, magnifying everything she did into a folly or&#xD;
a fault; but she allowed no one else the same privi-&#xD;
lege. The least reflection upon the idol of her heart.&#xD;
was sure to be visited with a reprimand.&#xD;
James did not presume to contradict Bess. He&#xD;
quietly took the seat at the table just vacated by Mel-&#xD;
ville, and waited very demurely for Bess to help him.&#xD;
"There ! ef you've sed over grace, you kin ete,"&#xD;
said Bess ; .her countenance assuming a very devout&#xD;
seriousness.&#xD;
James took the offered plate, and obeyed orders&#xD;
so cleverly and skillfully, that Bess began to regain&#xD;
her good temper, which had been ruffled by his incon-&#xD;
siderate charge against Bell. The exhibition of such&#xD;
extensive powers at. eating, Bess considered a great&#xD;
compliment to her cooking. It soon enabled her to&#xD;
overlook the charge of flightiness brought against&#xD;
Bell. Bess's respect for James arose in proportion to&#xD;
the rapidity with which the victualing disappeared.&#xD;
The inquiries for Bell were extensive, as the party&#xD;
of the evening before, assembled once more around&#xD;
the hospitable board, presented at the regular break-&#xD;
fast hour under- Mrs. Mortimer's roof. But none of&#xD;
&#xD;
the inquiries were satisfied. Mrs. Mortimer herself,&#xD;
was ignorant of Bell's movements.&#xD;
"Bess, go and call Mr. Melville," said Mrs. Mor-&#xD;
timer.&#xD;
" Yis, urn," replied Bess, and she immediately left&#xD;
the room, Entering the parlor, she seated herself in&#xD;
the largest rocking-chair, and commenced one of he&#xD;
soliloquies.&#xD;
Call Misser Melville ! dat am easier sed dan dun.&#xD;
I'se pinyun Miss Bell wants to mind her own biz'niss&#xD;
fur herself. Now, s'posin' I'se fool, tells Bell's gone&#xD;
wid Misser Melville. Dat want do way I'se brung&#xD;
up, nohow. Dar! I'se bin here 'nuff to go up de&#xD;
stars, an' Misser Melville ain't dar."&#xD;
Having thus marked out her line of conduct, Bess&#xD;
returned to the dining-room, and reported "Misser&#xD;
Melville's room hain't nobody in it.'&#xD;
Mrs. Mortimer became satisfied that Bell had gone&#xD;
for a drive, in company with Melville, and thought&#xD;
no further of the matter.&#xD;

&#xD;
Bell Mortamer makes' the Acquaintance of Sarah K. Grahar,&#xD;
Ta greeting between the doctor and Bell, upon&#xD;
her arrival at the city of U-, was sufficient evi-&#xD;
dence of old acquaintanceship. The doctor's carriage&#xD;
stood at the d6p6t ready to convey Bell to-the Asylum-&#xD;
On the way, he informed her of the revelations made&#xD;
by Sarah Graham, and the plans of her father.&#xD;
" Can Sarah be moved now ?" asked Bell.&#xD;
"I think she can," replied the doctor. "-I will&#xD;
send a physician, -however, as an escort; and my wife&#xD;
shall also accompany you."&#xD;
"When    o you think we had better start " asked&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
" That will depend entirely upon Sarah herself-&#xD;
Mrs. Graham arrived last night, and Sarah will not&#xD;
desire to leave her immediately," said the doctor.&#xD;
"Why not have Mrs.. Graham accompany us, and&#xD;
make the visit with Sarah," asked BelL&#xD;
"She cannot do so;, her business requires her prey;&#xD;
ence. She is, a milliner," said the doctor.&#xD;
They had now reached the Asylum. Bell was re-&#xD;
ceived with the utmost cordiality by the doctor's&#xD;
family.. Dinner over, the doctor conducted Bell to&#xD;
Sarah's room. He had so prepared the way, that a&#xD;
&#xD;

g39&#xD;
&#xD;
friendship soon sprang up between them. The ardu-&#xD;
oas duties of his post did not allow him to remain&#xD;
long, however pleasant his society might have&#xD;
proved. Bell's reception by Mrs. Graham was tinc-&#xD;
tured somewhat with an unnecessary restraint, caused&#xD;
by a difference of education and position; but Bell's&#xD;
frankness and cordiality of manners soon placed her&#xD;
at ease. Sarah had learned from her kind physician,&#xD;
that she  ight extend her love to Bell Mortimer&#xD;
without fearing that the affection would be slighted,&#xD;
or allowed to go unappreciated. She was, therefore,&#xD;
prepared to open her whole heart. Bell, during the&#xD;
short ride with the doctor from the depot, had ob-&#xD;
tained the particulars of the relation Sarah stood in&#xD;
regard to Melville's pardon. She at once divined&#xD;
the reason why her father wished to cover Sarah's&#xD;
retreat to Aurora under a veil of secrecy. By pre-&#xD;
venting even the most intimate friends from a know-&#xD;
ledge of her place of abode, the chances for her being&#xD;
discovered would be lessened. Mr. Mortimer had&#xD;
been taught by experience the advantageof keeping.&#xD;
his own counsel,, and Bell knew her father. She also&#xD;
knew James Mordaunt,.and saw that her father took&#xD;
the precaution to render him powerless to effect his&#xD;
purpose, should he endeavor to obtain an interview&#xD;
with Sarah. These precautions proved to be founded&#xD;
in wisdom; for James Mordaunt, before his convic-&#xD;
tion, while his liberty balanced upon a pivot, made&#xD;
every effort in his power to discover Sarah. He even&#xD;
went so far as to visit Aurora himself, and by mak-&#xD;
ing inquiries among the people, and learning that a&#xD;
lady had been visiting at Mr. Mortimer's answering&#xD;
to the description of Sarah, he essayed to send a&#xD;

&#xD;
female friend, with whom the Mortimer family were&#xD;
unacquainted, to call upon her.&#xD;
But Mr. Mortimer was too wary in his tactics to&#xD;
be caught., Although Sarah Graham   was at the&#xD;
time under his roof, and he himself in New York,&#xD;
still Nordaunt's plans did not succeed. His friend&#xD;
went away allowing herself to believe that no such&#xD;
person was at Mr. Mortimer's residence.&#xD;
This little episode we put in here, although it&#xD;
breaks the thread of our story, merely to fill up the&#xD;
time while Bell Mortimer and Sarah Graham are&#xD;
endeavoring to make up their minds whether they&#xD;
can become warm friends. So far as Bell was con-&#xD;
cerned, the question was soon solved. Sympathy,&#xD;
gratitude, and a father's expressed desire, were suf-&#xD;
ficiently powerful persuadents. On Sarah's part, the&#xD;
task was more difficult. She was the recipient of&#xD;
favor. Her pride revolted at obligations. Bell was&#xD;
her superior in position, intelligence, wealth, ponor,&#xD;
virtue. She had lost the beauty which had been at&#xD;
once her pride and her ruin. Bell was radiant with&#xD;
that beauty which Sarah's practised. eye told her&#xD;
;constituted the highest perfection of woman's attrac-&#xD;
tions. How, then, were two such hearts to become&#xD;
welded by the bonds of friendship? Sarah felt the&#xD;
gulf; Bell saw it. Bell determined to leap boldly&#xD;
across the chasm; Sarah timidly ventured to cross&#xD;
it, with tottering steps, upon a narrow foot-plank.&#xD;
But they did reach a common ground, and were&#xD;
joined by the holy bands of faith, hope and&#xD;
charity.&#xD;
At six o'clock r.x., George Melville drove, through&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Mortiner's carriage gate the fine span of bys&#xD;
which were the admiration and envy of half the&#xD;
county.&#xD;
"Where is Bell? Where's Bell? Where have you&#xD;
left Bell?" chorused a half-dozen voices at once, as&#xD;
he alighted and handed the reins to James.&#xD;
Could not possibly inform you," said Melville. I&#xD;
accompanied her this morning to Auburn. She took&#xD;
the cars for the East, and begged me to make her&#xD;
excuses to all whom it may concern here in this&#xD;
house."&#xD;
"But where has she gone ?" said Mrs. Edge-&#xD;
monte.&#xD;
aI can only answer that question by saying: She&#xD;
took the cars for the East, therefore she has gone&#xD;
East," said George.&#xD;
"That is the benefit of talking by lightning," said&#xD;
Mrs. Melville.&#xD;
"It's the telegraphic dispatch she received yester-&#xD;
day which has caused this mischief," said Mrs.&#xD;
Edgemonte. "Did she say good bye to you, Mrs.&#xD;
Mortimer ?"&#xD;
"She did not. This is the first news I have re-&#xD;
ceived about a telegraphic dispatch," replied Mrs.&#xD;
Mortimer. "I have no doubt everything is right,&#xD;
however. It was, doubtless, from  her father or&#xD;
Fred ; and she could not bear the idea of waking&#xD;
you all up merely to say good bye. What hour&#xD;
did you leave Aurora, Mr. Melville ?"&#xD;
"It was about half-past five o'clock," replied&#xD;
George.&#xD;
Two days subsequently, the whole party broke up,&#xD;
finding that woman's rights did not work satisfac-&#xD;

Mr. Hastings found it necessary to leave Aurora on&#xD;
the second morning after his arrival.&#xD;

As has been seen, George Melville, whe&#xD;
returned to Aurora, on the day he drove Mi&#xD;

of the porter, who stood in waiting.&#xD;

returned by both with real pleasure, for both had felt&#xD;
his kindness under many circumstances.&#xD;
"Will you take the cars this morning ?" asked the.&#xD;
landlord.&#xD;
"Miss Mortimer will," said Melville, in reply.&#xD;
"We had better leave the horses to get their feed,"&#xD;
said Melville, addressing Bell in a subdued tone.&#xD;
"Very well," replied Bell. "I make no objections&#xD;
to your arrangements."&#xD;
They alighted, and entered the hotel. In about&#xD;
half an hour, an omnibus stopped in front of the main&#xD;
entrance, and the porter cried out:&#xD;
"All aboard for the cars !"&#xD;
Bell and Melville took their seats in the omnibus,&#xD;
which conveyed them to the railroad depot in a few&#xD;
moments. She had not offered to inform Melville&#xD;
concerning her destination. She merely said that&#xD;
her father had telegraphed for her, and requested&#xD;
him to say as little as possible about her departure.&#xD;
He did not ask her destination. -'As soon as the cars&#xD;
had left the depot, Melville turned to retrace his&#xD;
steps to the omnibus, where. he was accosted by the&#xD;
machine contractor of the prison.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mr. Melville," said the,-con-&#xD;
tractor.&#xD;
"Good morning !" returned Melville, accepting his&#xD;
proffered hand.&#xD;
"You have left my steam-engine in the lurch, Mr.&#xD;
Melville," continued the contractor, with a smile.&#xD;
"I don't regret the step,.sir," replied Melville.&#xD;
"Probably not; but I regret your loss from my&#xD;
shop. Mr. Melville, they cannot make a fool of you&#xD;
longer, by asking you to dose the sick folks, and&#xD;
&#xD;
fight for or against either big or little pills. This is&#xD;
all a good and very necessary employment, but you&#xD;
have genius for a man's work. I am ready to offer&#xD;
you a partnership .in my contract,. or to establish&#xD;
with you an entirely new concern wheresoever you say&#xD;
locate it. My contract has three years to run,- and&#xD;
then I must depend on my chances for its extension.&#xD;
If any one bids over me, who is responsible, I lose it.&#xD;
What say you to adopting my profession, and letting&#xD;
-    your M.D.,certificate hang up for your grandchildren&#xD;
to wonder how it ever came into the family ?"&#xD;
"I am entirely willing to embark in the business,&#xD;
- but the prison contract would not be a pleasing con-&#xD;
nection."&#xD;
"That I expected you would say, Mr. Melville.&#xD;
A prison contract, however, is not the only warrant&#xD;
of success in the business."&#xD;
"I am well aware of that, sir," replied IMelville.&#xD;
"But at present, I do not feel sufficiently a master&#xD;
of trade, to indulge any extended risk of capital under&#xD;
my direction."&#xD;
"I am ready to make you the following propo-&#xD;
sition. As soon as I can dispose of my contract here&#xD;
by sale, or otherwise, I will embark an equal&#xD;
amount of capital with you. We will then enter' the&#xD;
city of New York together, and establish a first class&#xD;
manufactory of iron works," replied the contractor.&#xD;
"The proposition, sir, is certainly flattering, and&#xD;
merits the highest consideration. I am well aware&#xD;
that you would incur a heavy responsibility by en-&#xD;
deavoring to make me equal to you as an assistantin&#xD;
the daily routine," said Melville.&#xD;

of you. All may become more or less skillful- as&#xD;
workmen, but few have your bumps, as the phrenolo-&#xD;
gists say, for mechanical combination and invention,"&#xD;
said the contractor. "Come, Melville, you have&#xD;
an hour or so ; let me take you to my residence,&#xD;
where we can talk the matter over fully and I will&#xD;
show you my taste in the art of living."&#xD;
"Very well! I know of nothing, sir, that, just now,&#xD;
would give me greater pleasure," said Melville.&#xD;
"Going up town, sir ?" said the hotel porter.&#xD;
"I believe not at present," said. Melville, tossing&#xD;
the man a small bonus. "See that the bays are well&#xD;
provided for."&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied the porter.&#xD;
JMelville then joined the contractor. Their course&#xD;
led them first through the depot, then along a wide&#xD;
street, one side of which was occupied with houses&#xD;
of German and Irish laborers; some giving evidence&#xD;
of extreme poverty, while others showed thrift.&#xD;
The opposite side indicated more wealth. Several&#xD;
generous-appearing residences, surrounded with am-&#xD;
ple grounds and rich foliage, were unmistakable evi-&#xD;
dences of comfort, if not of luxury. This street was&#xD;
short in extent, leading east, and connecting two of&#xD;
the main outlets of the country travel to the city.&#xD;
Passing to the eastern extremity of the cross street,&#xD;
Melville and the contractor entered upon one of :the&#xD;
main outlets referred to-a broad and handsome&#xD;
thoroughfare, the lots on both sides being occupied&#xD;
with neat though not costly homesteads. The side-&#xD;
walks on this street were lined with beautiful trees,&#xD;
casting a grateful shade upon the passers-by. In a&#xD;
nortJerly direction, this street led up a long hill,&#xD;
&#xD;
the ascent being gentle, but, owing to the distance,&#xD;
the elevation was considerable.  Tall and stately&#xD;
poplar trees stood in front of several residences,&#xD;
cresting the brow of the hill. Here a change of air&#xD;
was perceptible, there being large and beautifully&#xD;
ornamented gardens, open lawns, and retreats thickly&#xD;
studded with shrubbery. The ailanthus, horse chest-&#xD;
nut, flowering maple, cedar, wild cherry, spruce, and so&#xD;
forth, adorned the door-yards in rich profusion, while&#xD;
the sidewalks were planted with magnificent trees,&#xD;
whose branches, locked in close embrace, formed for&#xD;
the carriage-passers a roof of closely-matted verdure.&#xD;
" Here you see my place, Mr. Melville," said the&#xD;
contractor, pointing to a large mansion built of brick,&#xD;
in front of which were several stately columns, painted&#xD;
white and bearing the Ionic characteristics in their&#xD;
fluting, caps and bases. The house stood back from&#xD;
the road about six or eight rods. The yard surround-&#xD;
ing it had a front which Melville judged to measure&#xD;
from eighteen to twenty rods.- To the right of the&#xD;
building was an extensive kitchen garden, tasfefully&#xD;
laid out into beds, the edges of which were carefully.&#xD;
bordered with a light green moss. The paths between&#xD;
the beds, winding in a hundred graceful curves, oc-&#xD;
casionally being turned into sharp angles, as the beds&#xD;
chanced to be circular or square in form, were filled&#xD;
with fine gravel, through which the industrious gar-&#xD;
dener would not allow a single blade of green to find&#xD;
its way. y Several grape arbors, or summer-houses,&#xD;
adorned the garden; one of which showed the ehagrae-&#xD;
ter and employment of the owner, being very large,&#xD;
of beautiful 'form, and constructed entirely of iron.&#xD;
At intervals in the garden were beds of flowers,&#xD;

forming a beautiful dress for the substantial, such as&#xD;
beets, onions, cabbages, cucumbers, melons, corn,&#xD;
beans, early potatoes, etc., etc. At this particular&#xD;
season, the whole garden was adorned, with thousands&#xD;
of dahlia blossoms, of all shades and varieties which&#xD;
the most untiring industry could procure. Directly&#xD;
in front of the house, the yard was filled with fruit-&#xD;
bearing trees of the rarest kinds, interspersed occa-&#xD;
sionally with a beautiful evergreen. At the roots of&#xD;
them, and surrounding their trunks,- the tasteful&#xD;
gardener had patiently removed the green sward,&#xD;
making them to stand in diamonds, crescents,&#xD;
hearts, circles, etc., the earth being worked very&#xD;
smooth, and then covered with white sand. To give'&#xD;
effect to the whole, the grass was kept closely shaven.&#xD;
"You must have enjoyed a! view of the Elysian&#xD;
Fields, sir, of which I have, had a very imaginary&#xD;
notion until this moment," said Melville.&#xD;
"Kot a very close view. I am one who can ap-&#xD;
preciate the beauties of such a home, but not one to&#xD;
build it. My wife and gardener do all the planning,&#xD;
executing, and buying. I simply pay the -piper,"&#xD;
said the contractor.&#xD;
Melville was now conducted into the house, and&#xD;
introduced by the contractor to his wife and daugh-&#xD;
ters-three additions to the programme, which Mel-&#xD;
ville considered clear gain. A tour of the garden&#xD;
was then made, which occupied a good share of the&#xD;
morning. In the meantime, the contractor was busily&#xD;
engaged perfecting his plans for Melville's considera-&#xD;
tion in regard to the proposed "Iron Works."&#xD;
The hour for dinner had arrived ere all the ar-&#xD;
rfngements for the plans had been perfected.&#xD;
&#xD;
After this staple meal had been accomplished,&#xD;
which is usually partaken of between twelve and one&#xD;
o'clock by the great mass of the American people, the&#xD;
contractor unfolded to Melville his project, present-&#xD;
ing him with the plan carefully put in writing.&#xD;
Melville's answer was frank and full-&#xD;
"I like the general features of the business, and&#xD;
have no doubt but that the details will prove both&#xD;
pleasurable and profitable. You shall have my an-&#xD;
swer in a few days. I will give it to you either per-&#xD;
sonally or by mail."&#xD;
It was now nearly half-past two o'clock, r.M. Mel-&#xD;
ville arose to take his departure.&#xD;
" My carriage will be here in a few moments, Mr.&#xD;
Melville. You must bid. the ladies good afternoon,&#xD;
and then I will drive you to the hotel."&#xD;
" I shall make no objections, although the walk&#xD;
would doubtless prove agreeable,".replied Melville.&#xD;
"The distance is about a miIe, sir, and you will&#xD;
save time by taking the carriage," replied the con-&#xD;
tractor.&#xD;
In a few moments the 'carriage arrived, and Mel~&#xD;
ville accompanied his friend to the hotel. Having&#xD;
ordered his horses, he started once more upon the&#xD;
road to Aurora, where he arrived, as the reader has&#xD;
already learned.&#xD;

XLIX.&#xD;
Trial of the Action " Wilcox against Mordaunt "-Thomas F. Griswold,&#xD;
Esquire, addresses the Jury-The Utica Asylum again-One of' the&#xD;
Biters bitten.&#xD;
Ors week subsequent to the departure of Bell&#xD;
Mortimer for the city of U-, the removal of Sarah&#xD;
E. Graham to Mr. Mortimer's residence in Aurora&#xD;
was accomplished. The fatigue of the journey was&#xD;
considerable for Sarah; but the change and exercise&#xD;
produced a salutary effect upon her health. Bell im-&#xD;
mediately devoted her whole time to make Sarah&#xD;
happy. A sister could not have shown greater sacri-&#xD;
fice, or more enduring attention. Each daysshe&#xD;
planned some excursion in which the "bays" were&#xD;
called into active requisition. Sarah began gradual-&#xD;
ly to love the hand that watched so closely for her&#xD;
comfort. Thus a month passed ; but ere it elapsed,&#xD;
Sarah had forgotten to reflect upon the idea, that&#xD;
she was incurring any obligation. She had been&#xD;
made to feel so much at home, that she had almost&#xD;
forgotten to brood over the past.&#xD;
In the meantime, J. S. Taylor, Esquire, was slowly&#xD;
bit steadily gaining ground in the cause instituted for&#xD;
the purpose of establishing the marriage of Mary Wil-&#xD;
cox with James Mordaunt. The time had arrived to&#xD;
&#xD;
bring the case before the courts. Every effort had&#xD;
had been made by Mordaunt to put off, harass and&#xD;
otherwise delay the' trial. On consultation with .his&#xD;
aunt, Mrs. Tryon, he had determined to contest the&#xD;
suit to the last. Should it go against him, it was&#xD;
merely a matter of dollars and-cents ; and, as regards&#xD;
character, he was already placed under three in-&#xD;
dictments, and consequently had nothing to lose.&#xD;
At length, the cause was duly noticed for trial by&#xD;
both parties, with a determination to abide an issue&#xD;
before a jury. Had the proofs been ample, Mr. Taylor&#xD;
would doubtless have hastened this desirable result.&#xD;
Considerable difficulty was raised by Mordaunt's&#xD;
counsel in regard to the jury. At length, the clerk'&#xD;
of the court announced the panel to be complete,&#xD;
when the judge ordered that the jury be sworn. The&#xD;
cause was then placed in the hands of the counsel.&#xD;
Mr. Thomas F. Griswold arose, and made the&#xD;
opening address. Said he:&#xD;
" May it please the court and gentlemen of the&#xD;
jury:&#xD;
" We are assembled for no ordinary purpose. The&#xD;
scales of justice are seldom filled with facts such as&#xD;
are now to be presented for your consideration. I&#xD;
am well aware of the high responsibility devolving&#xD;
upon each one engaged in the prosecution of a cause&#xD;
which strikes at the position, reputation, influence&#xD;
and purse of one who has gained, by superior talent,&#xD;
skill, and mental, acquirements, a hold upon the pub-&#xD;
lic mind, at once honorable and influent atial. It is&#xD;
true, circumstances have been developed, which have&#xD;
led the officers of justice to institute criminal proceed-&#xD;
ings against the defendant in this cause. This may&#xD;
&#xD;
GEORGE MELVILLE.   351&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7805-00000178"/>&#xD;
352     GEORG.E MELVILLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
have thrown around his name a taint for the time be-&#xD;
ing. It is my wish, and I consider it alike my duty,&#xD;
to endeavor to disabuse your minds of every feeling&#xD;
against the defendant on this account. Let him&#xD;
stand before your judgments as one who is pure. Let&#xD;
him fall from that high position, as regards your ver-&#xD;
dict in this action, only so far and so fast as the prose-&#xD;
cution shall develop iniquity, wrong and villainy, per-&#xD;
petrated by him upon her who sits at my side, asking&#xD;
that truth, and truth-alone may sway you. A few years&#xD;
since, a widowed mother possessed a beloved child.&#xD;
The mother's hopes and anticipations for that daughter&#xD;
were co-eqal with her health, bloom, industry, and&#xD;
intellectual promise, which loving friends and fond&#xD;
relatives freely discerned and proudly acknowledged.&#xD;
The destroyer came. Within a few short months,&#xD;
the fond mother's heart was turned to sorrow ; friends&#xD;
were made to point the finger of scorn at the daughter.&#xD;
She who sits at my side, lay. in the dust, stricken down&#xD;
and crushed in the morning of life. Up to this hour,&#xD;
no relenting thought has found its note of sympathy&#xD;
for the broken spirit. But .he, thus crushed, comes&#xD;
not before you in the attitude of criminality. So far as&#xD;
her acts are part of this history, she stands before you&#xD;
pure and spotless as the gentle rays of the evening&#xD;
twilight, a true and faithful wife. Such is a general&#xD;
picture of the case without relating the facts. As&#xD;
the cause shall be developed, you will be asked to&#xD;
determine the following series of events."&#xD;
We cannot pursue Mr. Griswold's opening address&#xD;
farther; nor is it necessary, as the remainder was a&#xD;
simple statement of the facts already known to the&#xD;
reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nor is it necessary to pursue the history of the&#xD;
trial, as the records of the court-room are notoriously&#xD;
so voluminous, that they would be out of position in&#xD;
these pages. Should any of our readers desire the&#xD;
records, doubtless the clerk of the county of New&#xD;
York will allow access to them, if they were put on&#xD;
file in his office, as they ought to have been.&#xD;
The trial of the cause lasted four days. It resulted,&#xD;
as has already appeared, in the complete vindication&#xD;
of Mary Wilcox's reputation ; and. gave her the&#xD;
right to assume the name of Mordaunt. A subse-&#xD;
quent action for divorce resulted in freeing Mary&#xD;
from Mordaunt, and setting apart for her a comfort-&#xD;
able support ; also, granting her the right to marry&#xD;
again.&#xD;
This act of justice was a severe stroke against the&#xD;
pride of Mrs. Tryon. Her interests and reputation&#xD;
were so identified with her nephew, .that she felt,&#xD;
perhaps keener than he, the disgrace attached to the&#xD;
verdict. The defeat had also lost to James Mordaunt&#xD;
much of his aunt's confidence in his skill. She was&#xD;
a woman who judged by results. This state of tran-&#xD;
sition against her nephew, led Mrs. Tryon to fear a&#xD;
similar issue in regard to the pending criminal pro-&#xD;
ceedings. Should James Mordaurnt be convicted,&#xD;
and stand before the world a condemned felon, then&#xD;
earth had no more comfort for her. Mrs. Tryon was&#xD;
only one of the thousand, who regard that success&#xD;
justifies the means, covering up terrible sins.&#xD;
Already her health. had suffered by a life of New&#xD;
York dissipation. In flesh, she had lost many pounds,&#xD;
and her spirits sank fast under the influences of a&#xD;
guilty conscience, abridged ambition, and a sinking&#xD;

constitution. Two months subsequently, she lay upon&#xD;
a bed, burning with fever, and the terrible gulf which&#xD;
separates man from his God seemed clearly visible.&#xD;
In two days she lost her reason.; but the hot fever&#xD;
raged on. Upon the tenth day, her physician thought&#xD;
he witnessed a change. His keen eye also saw that,&#xD;
although Mrs. Tryon might regain her strength, she&#xD;
would be a maniac. His fears proved to be too well&#xD;
founded. Two months from that time, James Mor-.&#xD;
daunt's aunt occupied, in advance of her nephew's&#xD;
conviction and sentence to the State prison, the iden-&#xD;
tical room in the State Asylum which had so long&#xD;

L.&#xD;
Death of a New York City Policeman-A Trial, Sentence, and Exe-&#xD;
cution--Ought Governors to hold the pardoning Power?&#xD;
THiE arrest of Robert Shank was made in the night-&#xD;
time. ie was taken with considerable difficulty.&#xD;
When the officer received Chief MI's telegraphic&#xD;
dispatch, Shank was in a gambling-house on Broad&#xD;
way. The approach of the police was discovered,&#xD;
and all in the house at the time endeavored to make&#xD;
their escape. By accident, one of the police, after&#xD;
all hopes of making the arrest that night seemed lost,&#xD;
chanced to walk through Canal street from Broad-&#xD;
way, into Mercer street. Opposite a lamp-post, he&#xD;
saw a man, apparently endeavoring to read the hour&#xD;
from his watch. Closely scanning his features, he&#xD;
recognized the very game he sought. Immedia .&#xD;
giving a signal for assistance, he seized him by the&#xD;
arm, saying-&#xD;
"Robert Shank, you are my prisoner."&#xD;
Shank aimed a, blow at the officer, which was&#xD;
successfully parried. A trial of strength ensued, in&#xD;
which Shank drew a knife and succeeded in infliet-&#xD;
ing a dangerous wound upon the officer's left breast.&#xD;
The wounded man fell heavily to the ground; but,&#xD;
not relaxing his hold, Shank was drawn down with&#xD;
him.&#xD;

&#xD;
As he was about to inflict a second blow upon the&#xD;
fallen policeman, his arm was rendered powerless&#xD;
by a well-directed blow given by a policeman, who'&#xD;
had answered the signal. Shank. felt himself seized&#xD;
by a second assailant. Mustering all his strength, he&#xD;
made one more effort to effectlis escape. In this he&#xD;
would have succeeded, but for the unflinching cou-&#xD;
rage of the wounded officer, who, having. grasped his&#xD;
legs with both arms, held him, as the event proved,&#xD;
with the death grasp. This enabled the second offi-&#xD;
cer to aim a blow at Shank which, for the instant,&#xD;
rendered him powerless.   Taking a cord from his&#xD;
pocket, he succeeded in binding Shank's arms behind&#xD;
his back, before he revived from the effects of the&#xD;
blow. Several other officers now reached thescene&#xD;
of action, when Shank was fully secured. His knife&#xD;
was picked up, reeking with blood. Before assist-&#xD;
ancecould be procured for the wounded policeman,&#xD;
he breathed his last. Shank was immediately con-&#xD;
veyed to the Tombs.*&#xD;
The wheels of justice, when money is freely used&#xD;
to ,b, k them, turn slowly, and, too often, crazily.&#xD;
ithstanding the clear evidence which marked&#xD;
k for the gallows, still, nearly ten months had&#xD;
elapsed from the time he killed the policeman before&#xD;
he was adjudged to die. On the thirtieth day of&#xD;
June, he was brought into court to receive his sen-&#xD;
tence. The case had not failed to excite considerable&#xD;
interest, as all actions on behalf of the people, in-&#xD;
volving the penalty of death, usually do. In conse-&#xD;
quence, the court-room was filled. At ten o'clock in&#xD;
* "Tombs," is a nickname bestowed upon one of the New&#xD;
York city jails.&#xD;
&#xD;
the morning, the prisoner was led into the room.&#xD;
Every eye was instantly turned upon him. He&#xD;
walked erect and firmly, looking over the assembled&#xD;
hundreds, with a careless, but unflinching glance; A&#xD;
close observer, however, might have detected in his&#xD;
eye, regret. Whether it was a regret which pro-&#xD;
ceeded from fear of death, aroused by a guilty con-&#xD;
science, or a regret dt not being permitted to prey&#xD;
longer upon honest people, it was impossible to de-&#xD;
cide. While the prisoner was being led to a seat by&#xD;
his counsel, a buzz ran over the audience, caused by&#xD;
a general movement to obtain a better view of him.&#xD;
At length, the court crier rapped several times&#xD;
upon his desk, when instantly a solemn stillness per-&#xD;
vaded the audience. Every breath was held, and&#xD;
every ear eagerly opened to catch each word of the&#xD;
presiding justice. He thus addressed the guilty&#xD;
wretch before him.&#xD;
"Robert Shank, stand up."&#xD;
The prisoner arose. Qnce more, a general buzz&#xD;
ran over the audience, which was immediately suc-&#xD;
ceeded by a silence as of the grave.&#xD;
The judge, whose benevolent countenance sho*&#xD;
plainly how sincerely he shrank from the sole&#xD;
duty which devolved upon him, then delivered the&#xD;
following address to the prisoner:&#xD;
"Prisoner at the bar! you stand before this court&#xD;
convicted of the crime of murder, the highest offence&#xD;
known against human law. Your conviction has&#xD;
been the result of an earnest, careful, and solemn&#xD;
discharge of duty. That duty has been unsought by&#xD;
the men who have sealed your doom. In making up&#xD;
their verdict, your jury have been assisted by the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7805-00000181"/>&#xD;
158     GEORGE MELVILLE&#xD;
&#xD;
efforts of wise counsels and earnest appeals both pn&#xD;
your behalf and for the measure of justice. The&#xD;
doubt, which the law, with her ready protection,&#xD;
throws around the life and liberty of .every citizen,&#xD;
has, by their verdict, been, taken from your brow.&#xD;
In its place, there is stamped upon it, in plain charac-&#xD;
ters, the terrible word 'murderer.'  See to it, ere&#xD;
the short time shall elapse which the court, for your&#xD;
own sake, has determined to add to your life, that&#xD;
this terrible word does not become stamped in inef-&#xD;
faceable characters upon your soul.  The facts of&#xD;
your crime are peculiar. While the hand of justice&#xD;
was being laid upon your arm, calling you to an ac-&#xD;
count for'the life of oneonce a herald of God's truth&#xD;
to man, and for the taking of whose life you would&#xD;
have been brought to trial, had the result of the pre-&#xD;
sent action been different; with the knowledge of&#xD;
your crimes, or your innocence, you struck down a&#xD;
fellow-being, who had warned you that his purpose&#xD;
was commanded by duty. Innocence seldom feareth&#xD;
the inquiry of justice, however searching.  Con-&#xD;
scious guilt is sure to plan and quick to execute addi-&#xD;
t' nal crime. The verdict of your jury, while it con-&#xD;
sffns your body to a felon's death, also gives public&#xD;
opinion the right to look to you for a solution of the&#xD;
doubt which yet hangs over the memory of your sup-&#xD;
posed victim, Rev. John Furnace. See to it, as you&#xD;
endeavor to make your peace with heaven, that you&#xD;
hesitate long to approach that grave which separates&#xD;
all mankind from the Great Judge, without removing&#xD;
so much of your guilt as confession and repentance,&#xD;
handmaids of Truth, can wash from your soul.&#xD;
"Robert Shank, have you anything to say why&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
thy sentence of the law should not now be pro-&#xD;
nounced against you?"&#xD;
The large audience waited in breathless silence to&#xD;
catch the prisoner's reply. It was very evident that&#xD;
the address of the judge, so entirely unexpected by&#xD;
the prisoner, as well as by the audience, had been&#xD;
carefully listened to and duly weighed by the guilty&#xD;
inan. But one thing prevented him from making a&#xD;
full confession upon the spot-the fear that he should&#xD;
implicate Mordaunt. After waiting a few moments,&#xD;
he replied:&#xD;
"Nothing, sir."&#xD;
The justice then, taking up a piece of paper, con-&#xD;
tinued:&#xD;
"Robert Shank, you have been tried and convicted&#xD;
of the crime of murder, by a jury of your country-&#xD;
men, for the killing of John Peabody. It remains&#xD;
for this court to pass upon you the sentence of the&#xD;
law, in such cases made and provided. It is, that you&#xD;
be taken from this room back to the confinement&#xD;
from whence you came; that you be there kept until&#xD;
the 16th day of August, proximo; that on that day,&#xD;
between the hours of eight o'clock, A.., and six&#xD;
o'clock, P.M., you be hanged by the neck until dead.&#xD;
And may God have mercy upon your soul."&#xD;
*      *      *      *      *      *   .&#xD;
On the sixth day of August, subsequent to receiv-&#xD;
ing his sentence, Shank sent a request for his counsel&#xD;
to visit him, in company with a young clergyman to&#xD;
whom he had become very much attached, and who,&#xD;
in view of the awful doom which awaited Shank, had&#xD;
been very attentive to him.&#xD;
On that day he made a full confession of his&#xD;

inducements to procure confessions similar to those&#xD;
offered by the Holy Law Giver? Would not the&#xD;
certain fear of the convicted felon's confession, for&#xD;
the sake of commutation of sentence, stand as a pow-&#xD;
erful preventive of banded villainy ? This view may&#xD;
be wrong. Heaven's statute law, however,is founded&#xD;
upon it, so far as the doctrines of confession and re-&#xD;
pentance militate.&#xD;
James Mordaunt, it will be remembered, was sen-&#xD;
tenced to five years at hard labor in the State prison.&#xD;
Ie was taken to the Sing Sing prison, which is&#xD;
located in the village of Sing Sing, on the eastern&#xD;
banks of the Hudson, a little more than thirty miles&#xD;
from New York. He remained there but six months.&#xD;
Through the interest of Mr. Mortimer, exerted in his&#xD;
behalf; he was made the book-keeper of the prison--&#xD;
an occupation which relieved him from the hard&#xD;
labor, contemplated by the letter of the law; and we&#xD;
doubt very much whether it carried out the spirt&#xD;
thereof. At the expiration of six months, the Sing&#xD;
Sing prison having become hyper-surfeited with&#xD;
convicts, he, in common with nineteen others, was&#xD;
removed to the Auburn prison. At Auburn he&#xD;
obtained little sympathy. There George Melville&#xD;
was known; and the man who had imprisoned him,&#xD;
with whom the relations of friendship as well as com-&#xD;
mon humanity, ought to have proved sufficient to&#xD;
prevent the crime, found no favor at the hands of the-&#xD;
keepers.&#xD;
"Where shall James Mordaunt be put ?" asked&#xD;
the clerk, as the agent entered the office. "He has&#xD;
no trade."&#xD;
"Mordaunt," said the agent, "would you not pre-&#xD;

you shall go.. The machine shop. Who knows but&#xD;
what, when your time is out, you may want a job of&#xD;
George Melville?$ Be industrious, Mordaunt, and&#xD;
we will make a good mechanic of you."&#xD;
Mordaunt, had. he dared, could have stricken the&#xD;
agent to the ground ; but he concluded, very wisely,&#xD;
to use discretion under the circumstances.&#xD;
The agent was up to his word. To the machine&#xD;
siop Mordaunt went. He failed to carry there any&#xD;
natural mechanical ability. During the time of, his&#xD;
service as a .convict, he wasconsidered a drone in the&#xD;
hive. We leave him for a while to regret the bitter&#xD;
fate he ha4 !dealt out so readily for a base revenge,&#xD;
and which had recoiled so significantly.&#xD;

"Yes, Miss Mortimer, that is the celebrated, I&#xD;

"And what is that tall mountain in the north I"&#xD;

Mrs. Mortimer, accompanied by Bell and Frede-&#xD;
rick, had just been on a jaunt to the Island Mar-&#xD;
tha's Vineyard for the purpose of returning the visits&#xD;
made them by Mr. and Mrs. Melville, at Aurora.&#xD;
it has already appeared that Edgartown was the&#xD;
home of George Melville. Edgartown occupies a&#xD;
lovely spot on this western hemisphere. There is an&#xD;
ofd tradition surrounding the Island Maitha's Vine-&#xD;
yd.: -Why it should not be entitled to credit we&#xD;
cannot perceive. Certain are we, the romance of&#xD;
truth surpasses. any creations of the imagination.&#xD;
There being real romance in this tradition, we are&#xD;
strongly inclined to believe in its truth. As the&#xD;
story is handed down, a celebrated Indian chieftain&#xD;
owned two islands, situated southeast of the State&#xD;
called Massachusetts, and now forming a part there-&#xD;
of. This chieftain had two daughters. Soon after.&#xD;
the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock,&#xD;
these islands werevisited by the whites. . They were&#xD;
dally received by the Indian warrior, and hospi-&#xD;
tablentertained. In cowmrse of tine, a strong friend-.&#xD;
.p arose between;the whites and the old chieftain,&#xD;
whichled to yearly interchanges of visits. As his&#xD;
daughters grew  xp they were christened by their&#xD;
htefriends, additionalstheir Indian titles, Martha&#xD;
d Nancy. Finally, the ald chieftain, brought down&#xD;
by the atd.of disease, felt his end approaching.&#xD;
Calling.his daughters, he said, using the broken Eng-&#xD;
lish which he had learned, and which he always&#xD;
spoke with evident pride-&#xD;
&#xD;
Nancy-Martha-me old; me go to the happy&#xD;
hunting grounds. Me no leave you look up to me,&#xD;
and say, which island- mine?   Me say, you know&#xD;
now which have. Nan, you old; choose ! Martha,&#xD;
you young; have other !"&#xD;
Nancy being thus commanded by the dying chief&#xD;
selected for her inheritance the island now known as&#xD;
Nantucket, so called because "Nan took it." Martha&#xD;
received the other, which has ever since borne her&#xD;
name, being known as the island "Martha's Vine-&#xD;
yard."&#xD;
A summer jaunt to these islands is full of interest,&#xD;
involving, as-At does, someof the grandest water&#xD;
scenery on the American continent. They are peo-&#xD;
pled by a race of bold mariners. Every two men out&#xD;
of three of the inhabitants bear'the' title "captain"&#xD;
as an honorable handle to their names. The shores&#xD;
of the islands are washed by the waves of old Ocean.&#xD;
Forever the rolling surf has been singing its mourn-&#xD;
ful requiem  where are new the graves of the old&#xD;
chieftain's daughters.  As the "Eagle's Wing "-&#xD;
bears us away from- the Vineyard, we offer the&#xD;
following tribute to the gentle Indian Martha, who&#xD;
yet hovers over the grave of her once mortal self,&#xD;

home uniting the pleasures of a country life, the lux-&#xD;
uries of both foreign and inland commerce, turned&#xD;
towards the island by the" Eagle's Wing," and a rich&#xD;
supply of unadulter4ed-sea-breezes.,&#xD;

" George, the diamond never becomes dimmed.&#xD;

"Bell, then    you  shall become     a  tree in my&#xD;

"A tree ?" said Bell.   "Why a tree ?"&#xD;
"Listen to Allan Ramsay," replied George.&#xD;

Bell.&#xD;

Meiwood and her-daughter had accepted Mrs. Morti-&#xD;

lar request of George Melville, the. party first went&#xD;
to Boston, and from thence to Pittsfield,. where&#xD;
George desired to renew some of his old associations&#xD;
as a medical student.&#xD;
At Albany, George left the party, and took the cars&#xD;
for New York, where now an equal partner with Mr.&#xD;
James Carter, his friend the contractor, of Auburn&#xD;
memory, he stood at the head of one of the most&#xD;
extensive "iron works " in the United States. Al-&#xD;
ready he had succeeded in planning, and his establish-&#xD;
ment had executed the plans, Which had given to&#xD;
American steam navigation a rank equal with the&#xD;
world. He was quoted as an authority by the enter-&#xD;
prising capitalists, who sought to compete with Eng-&#xD;
lish progress, for his name stood high upon the list&#xD;
of American mechanics. Already it was spoken with&#xD;
pride, whenever the comparative merits of American&#xD;
and foreign mechanical inventors formed the theme&#xD;
of social converse.&#xD;

In is a Sabbath-day morning ; the streets -of the&#xD;
city of Auburn give token of the solemn respect&#xD;
which the great American heart pays to the day of&#xD;
sacred rest. The distant church-clock strikes eight.&#xD;
Coming from different parts of the, city, a number&#xD;
-   of young men have been gradually approaching the&#xD;
central entrance of the state prison. The ponderous&#xD;
gate slowly yields to the continued pressure of the&#xD;
gate-keeper. Let us enter in company with the band&#xD;
of young men, and note their object. It is neither&#xD;
our purpose, nor have we the inclination, to accept&#xD;
the invitation extended, to join in the duties of the'&#xD;
morning hour. To become a successful and efficient&#xD;
Sunday-school teacher, requires early training and&#xD;

&#xD;
caused the visit to the prison of so many young men&#xD;
is now apparent. They have come to assist the con-&#xD;
victs in their efforts to study the Holy Scriptures.&#xD;
"Attendance upon the Sunday-school," said one of&#xD;
the keepers present, answering our inquiry, "is not&#xD;
compulsory."&#xD;
Among the several classes, we approach one, the&#xD;
members of which appear unusually interested in&#xD;
the conversation of the teacher. To our astQnish-&#xD;
ment, we recognize, as the convict apparently most&#xD;
interested in the exercises, James Mordaunt. Our&#xD;
knowledge of the man, and his earnest interest in&#xD;
subjects so foreign to our appreciation of him, do not&#xD;
harmpize. And yet, evidently, this must be the&#xD;
feeIg awakenedin the breast of every casual visitor&#xD;
to such a Sunday-school, who recognizes an acquaint-&#xD;
ance among theconvicts.&#xD;
The remaining half hour is full of interest, espe-&#xD;
cially as devoted to speculations in regard to James&#xD;
Mordaunt.- We are informed by one of the keepers&#xD;
that Mordaunt only joined the Sunday-school a few&#xD;
weeks since..-&#xD;
Many of the convicts," said the keeper, "attend&#xD;
Sunday-school to pass away the time. It is better&#xD;
than staying shut up in a cell. I guess Mordatnt&#xD;
don't care much about the religious part. He's been&#xD;
pretty regular, though, since the first week in last&#xD;
month."&#xD;
When does the regularsservice commence ?"&#xD;
"Pretty ,oon, now," answered thekeeper.&#xD;
The bell of the prison, a short time after, was rung,&#xD;
anniouning the hour for morning service. In aphort&#xD;
time, the measured tread of the convicts, marching&#xD;
&#xD;
in columns, by companies, was heard upon the stair-&#xD;
case leading to the chapel.    When the convicts had&#xD;
been seated, between fifty and sixty visitors were&#xD;
admitted.. The audience now consisted of about seven&#xD;
hundred convicts, thirty to forty keepers, and nearly a&#xD;
hundred visitors; about half of the latter being ladies.&#xD;
The exercises were commenced by a short, earnest&#xD;
prayer, spoken by the chaplain. This was followed by&#xD;
the reading of a selection from the Holy Scriptures.&#xD;
To our surprise, the clergyman, taking up a hymn-&#xD;
book, gave out, and read the following hymn:&#xD;
"0 sinner, bring not tears alone,&#xD;
Or outward form of prayer;-&#xD;
But let it in thy heart be known&#xD;
That penitence is there.&#xD;
" To smite the breast, the clothes to rend,&#xD;
God asketh not of thee:&#xD;
Thy secret soul he bids thee bend&#xD;
In true humility.&#xD;
"Oh, let us then, with heartfelt grief,&#xD;
Draw near unto our God,&#xD;
And pray to him to grant relief&#xD;
And stay the lifted rod.&#xD;
"O righteous Judge, if thou wilt deign,&#xD;
To grant us what we need,&#xD;
We pray for time to turn again&#xD;
And grace to turn indeed.&#xD;
During the reading of! the hymn, a problem of&#xD;
no little difficulty has arisen!  Who is to do the sing-&#xD;
ing ? This difficulty is overcome, if not :in a style&#xD;
entirely scholastic, in a manner admirably aj ros&#xD;
priate to the time, place, and occasion. Far to the&#xD;

left, in the southwestern corner of the chapel, about&#xD;
twenty convicts arise; one, evidently the leader, or&#xD;
chorister, sounding his tuning fork, gives the- pitch&#xD;
to his choir. Expectation, being so emphatically at&#xD;
a ow ebia, the convict-choir commence their effort&#xD;
toy.at well their part, under fair auspices.  Some&#xD;
of "the harmony is new;j but, you have listened&#xD;
to such- newness, so often, under circumstances of&#xD;
greater pretence, that criticism dare'not exercise&#xD;
herself.  Gradually, the sentiment of the hymn,&#xD;
touching a chord in your own breast, dissipates&#xD;
the curiosity aroused, and awakens a full appreci-&#xD;
ation of the beautiful truth so clearly made manifest.&#xD;
"Heaven's joy is greatest when the vilest sinner&#xD;
repents." -This appreciation growing stronger, the&#xD;
heart joins in the prayer of the concluding stanza,&#xD;
with earnest humility. A prayer; another hymn;&#xD;
sermon; a concluding prayer and hymn, and then&#xD;
the heartfelt benediction of the worthy man of God.&#xD;
Y THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JEsUs OmCHsT REST&#xD;
tOx II}'ABIDE WITH YOU FOREVER. AMEN.&#xD;
Th1 ±$evice has ended. You have admired the&#xD;
preacher's style; felt his earnestness; been instructed&#xD;
by his wisdom, and now desire to know him.&#xD;
To what denomination of Christians does'the&#xD;
chaplain belong ?"&#xD;
"The Methodist," replied the keeper.&#xD;
"Is it possible to make his acquaintance to-day, sit?"&#xD;
"I think not. He sometimes devotes his time to.&#xD;
visiting the convicts in their cells. I think he i.&#xD;
teds doing so this morning," replied the keeper.&#xD;
There being nothing farther to warrant visitors 'in&#xD;
prolonging their stay, you retire from the prison..&#xD;
&#xD;
The bells of the city churches are now ringing&#xD;
forth a solemn peal, calling upon all of the inhabitants&#xD;
to go up unto the houses of God for the morning ser-&#xD;
vice.&#xD;
There is held.usually but one service in this prison.&#xD;
The convicts occupy the remainder of the day in&#xD;
their cells. Books, of a religious character only, are&#xD;
furnished to all who desire them, from the State li-&#xD;
brary, attached to the prison, of which the chaplain is&#xD;
the regular librarian.&#xD;
The man of God, who has received         for his&#xD;
flock a convict parish-can scarcely be placed in a&#xD;
position of greater responsibility. The comparative&#xD;
results of different workers in such an institution&#xD;
show, as clearly as the full corn in the ear,. when the&#xD;
field is ,ripe for the harvest. There are few places&#xD;
where the triumphs of revealed truth are more effee-&#xD;
tually or more satisfactorily exhibited, nor are the in-&#xD;
stances of rare occurrence.&#xD;
James   ordaunt, after the noon meal, retired into'&#xD;
his narrow cell, bearing in his hand a copy of'Bun-&#xD;
yan's Pilgrim's Progress. The pages were carefully&#xD;
read, and the rich fountain of truth, so beautifully&#xD;
adorned, proved to be an oasis upon the desert. The&#xD;
hours passed rapidly away,until the gathering darkness&#xD;
prevented him from longer distinguishing the letters.&#xD;
An hour later, Mordaunt's cell was complete dark-&#xD;
ened. The limits. of his walk were bounded by three&#xD;
short paces from west to east, by one from north to&#xD;
south, while with the hand he could strike the ceil-&#xD;
ing above his head without effort. To gather in the&#xD;
rays from a distant lamp, designed to light the patrol,&#xD;
he was compelled to assume a stooping posture, and&#xD;

inch square.&#xD;
The book had long since been, of necessity, relin-&#xD;
qiihed   Hour after hour of the solemn night had&#xD;
p  ed away. Still James Mordaunt heeded not the&#xD;
sal ir  eot upon which he nightly slept. Thought&#xD;
was thoiusy. Remorse had begun to claim his flesh.&#xD;
A convict's fare and a convict's habits of life were not&#xD;
responsible for the failing health. Three years had&#xD;
passed by, during which time the proud and haughty&#xD;
villain, aided by the sophistries that so surely turn&#xD;
wisdom into foolishness, had quieted conscience by&#xD;
exaggerated pictures; fancy, for truth; revenge for&#xD;
honest determination; the desire to possess one who&#xD;
had crossed his self-esteem by refusing his hand, for&#xD;
unselfish affection.&#xD;
But now, nighttime and daytime were hours for the&#xD;
seeds of remorse to germinate. Already unseen, they&#xD;
had sprouted from a thousand parts of his flesh, and&#xD;
sapped,,it up in their slow but steady growth.&#xD;
" Remorse !" uttered the miserable man, as he mad-&#xD;
ly struck his brow, beneath which an over-heated&#xD;
brain was toiling.&#xD;
"Remorse I" echoed the sharp stings of a con-&#xD;
science at last awakened to a sense of guilt.&#xD;
Morning came ; but when the prison bell called&#xD;
the.convicts from their cells, Mordaunt heard it not.&#xD;
A short time after his condition became known, he&#xD;
was visited by the agent, who ordered four convicts&#xD;
to his cell, accompanied by a keeper, and bearing a&#xD;
litter. Upon this he was immediately removed to&#xD;
the hospital. At nine o'clock, the physician of the&#xD;
&#xD;
prison arrived. Upon due examination, he pro-&#xD;
nounced Mordaunt's disease to be typhus fever.&#xD;
When the clerk of the prison learned this fact, he&#xD;
communicated it to Mr. Mortimer by letter. That&#xD;
gentleman determined to respond to the clerk'slet-&#xD;
ter by making Mordaunt a visit. He arrived at;Au-&#xD;
burn three days after the receipt of the letter, which&#xD;
had found him in New York.&#xD;
" Good morning, Mr. Mortimer," said the clerk, as&#xD;
that gentleman entered his office at the prison. "You&#xD;
have called in consequence of my letter."&#xD;
"How is Mordaunt ?" said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"No better," replied clerk.  "The opinion pre-&#xD;
vails that he cannot survive."&#xD;
"Has he any idea of this- himself ?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Mortimer.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. He has asked to see Sarah E. Graham.&#xD;
By the advice of the physician, she has been notified&#xD;
of his wish. She will, doubtless, arrive this after-&#xD;
noon, or to-morrow morning, if able to come. She is&#xD;
now with her mother. He has also expressed a de-&#xD;
sire to see Mary Wilcox and his daughter."&#xD;
"Then he has acknowledged them at last," said&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Yes; and evidently some powerful motive has&#xD;
led to this result," said the clerk.&#xD;
"What is the matter with him?" asked Mr. Mor-&#xD;
timer.&#xD;
"Typhus fever,"-said the clerk.&#xD;
"How is he this morning ?" said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Out of his head," replied the clerk. "He became&#xD;
flighty, yesterday morning, and has been growing&#xD;
wrse. This morning he is completely prostrated;&#xD;

seems to recognize no one. The hospital physician&#xD;
has invited a council of the city physicians, which is&#xD;
to convene in about half an hour."&#xD;
"I am glad he has acknowledged that Mary Wil-&#xD;
coe was his wife. That act of justice, although it has&#xD;
come at the eleventh hour, will give great pleasure&#xD;
to Mary," said Mr. Mortimer.&#xD;
The council of physicians assembled soon after,&#xD;
and Mr. Mortimer was invited to be present. It was&#xD;
- the general opinion that he could not survive. On&#xD;
the subseqent day, Sarah E. Graham arrived, accom-&#xD;
panied by her mother. By the kindness of the agent,&#xD;
they were permitted. to occupy a place within the&#xD;
prison, in his own family.. Owing to Mordaunt's&#xD;
critical position, a separate room had been assigned&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
Upon receiving news of his sickness, and the de-&#xD;
sire he had expressed, Mary Wilcox did not hesitate&#xD;
to accompany her uncle, Captain Joseph Horton, to'&#xD;
Auburn. She arrived two days after Sarah Graham.&#xD;
There had been no change for 'the better. Up to&#xD;
.   this time, Mordaunt had been entirely unconscious&#xD;
of the presence of any one in his room.&#xD;
The tears of Sarah fell thick and fast. as she entered&#xD;
the presence of one whom she had never ceased en-&#xD;
tirely to look upon with affection. But Sarah was now,&#xD;
actuated through other feelings than those inspired&#xD;
by regret at .his bodily sufferings.  The idea that&#xD;
James Mordaunt was apparently- about to die, with&#xD;
the weight of sin upon his soul unremoved by any&#xD;
sign or token of repentance, was the moving cause,&#xD;
of her anguish. Sarah Graham had joined the pure&#xD;
of heart in this world of trial, and had devoted hey&#xD;
&#xD;
life to acts of kindness and benevolence. How ar-&#xD;
dently she offered up her secret prayer that reason&#xD;
might:return to James Mordaunt, if but for one sin-&#xD;
gle hour ! In this prayer she was joined by Mary&#xD;
Wilcox, who, since her divorce had dropped the&#xD;
name of Mordaunt. Notwithstanding the earnest&#xD;
appeals of Mary and Sarah, James Mordaunt was not&#xD;
permitted again to commune with his victims. On&#xD;
the eleventh daysfrom the time he was first'attacked,&#xD;
he expired. His last few moments were full of terrible&#xD;
agony. When every one present had supposed that&#xD;
he was gone, his body suddenly became gifted with&#xD;
a supernatural energy. He rose in bed, and opened&#xD;
his eyes, and in a loud voice, like the commander&#xD;
.upon the battle-field, said-&#xD;
" Brandy 1'&#xD;
Instantly a goblet of brandy was offered to him, of&#xD;
which he quickly and nervously drank. Then, look-&#xD;
ing fiercely upon those gathered around his bed, he&#xD;
spoke again with renewed energy:&#xD;
Is there a place called hell? Then I go there !"&#xD;
A cold shiver ran over his frame. Once more he&#xD;
gasped for breath. The sudden flush which had&#xD;
accompanied this spasmodic strength as suddenly de-&#xD;
parted. Sinking again upon his pillow, a terrible&#xD;
tremor shook his frame, communicating with they&#xD;
bedstead and the room. Once more he gasped for&#xD;
breath ; but it wasa last effort. Death put an end&#xD;
to his bodily sufferings. The spirit had gone before-&#xD;
another tribunal. Was it that of an offended God?$&#xD;

Six months subsequently, Mrs. Tryon followed&#xD;
upon the same path, to that&#xD;
" Bourn from whence no traveller returns."&#xD;
She died a raving maniac in the lunatic asylum.&#xD;
Mary Mordaunt, while thus a little girl, became&#xD;
the sole heiress both to her father's estate and Mrs.&#xD;
Tryon's. Together, they amounted to nearly half a&#xD;
million. An attempt was made by some of the re-&#xD;

It was never brought-to trial.&#xD;

A Wedding-Wedding Tour-Conclusion.&#xD;
LAws, suz! never did see sich nobody knowin'&#xD;
nothin' sence I'se born. It's Bess here, an' Bess&#xD;
thar, an' Bess ! Bess 1"&#xD;
" Bess," said James.&#xD;
"Git eout! now, jest, you 'tend to your own&#xD;
bizness. I'se 'bout tired ov this ere doin's."&#xD;
" Bess, Bess," said Frederick Mortimer.&#xD;
"Yis, sir," said Bess,. as mildly as a kitten.&#xD;
"What Misser Frederick want "&#xD;
"Bell desires-your presence up stairs immediately,"&#xD;
"Bess," said Mrs. Mortimer, "there will be four&#xD;
more at dinner to-day."&#xD;
"Yis 'um," said Bess, nearly in despair.&#xD;
"Bess," said Mr. Mortimer, "five large glasses in&#xD;
the study, and a bottle of the brown sherry. Some&#xD;
ice, lemon, and sugar.&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer, although a temperate man, prided&#xD;
himself upon his home-made sherry cobblers.&#xD;
Bess now woke up to the demands made upon&#xD;
her. In a few moments she had marshalled the&#xD;
servants of the house, who were all amenable to her,&#xD;
and had given  to each their directions. Out of the&#xD;
chaos, she soon brought order.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Wal, now," said Bess, "it's good this, marryin'&#xD;
don't come only once in a family."&#xD;
Bess evidently judged all families by Mr. Morti-&#xD;
mer's; and in so doing, failed to remember that some&#xD;
young ladies were blessed with rare gems in the&#xD;
shape of lovely, and often lovelier sisters. However,&#xD;
in this remark, Bess was sincere. She really be-&#xD;
lieved marryingn only came once in a family."&#xD;
In due time, the dinner-party was fully arranged.&#xD;
And a grand affair Bess had determined it should be,&#xD;
"All out o' kompulment to Miss Bell Mortiner,&#xD;
she'd trotted on hur knee, she had." And a grand&#xD;
affair it was. For the past three hours, Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Mortimer, Mr. and Mrs. Melville, and 2Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
George Melville, had been receiving the congratula-&#xD;
tions of half the county of Cayuga, besides all of&#xD;
Aurora, from the highest to the lowest in the scale&#xD;
of fortune; for Hon. B. F. Mortimer, like the good&#xD;
olden gentlemen, a race which will never become&#xD;
extinct in rural America, shook a man's hand for his&#xD;
mental and moral. worth, not for his cloth ; and,&#xD;
kissed a lass for her rich, sunny smile, rosy cheeks,&#xD;
laughing eyes, and guileless heart, not for her&#xD;
furbelows and flounces.&#xD;
But now, the more select family dinner-party was&#xD;
at hand. Around this board was gathered all the.&#xD;
relatives and bosom friends of the Mortiner family,&#xD;
a goodly host. Among the number who belonged&#xD;
to ;the Melville party, were Mr. Wilham Hastings&#xD;
ard his lovely bride Florence,,who looked upon the&#xD;
company assembled but one short week a wife. The&#xD;
A adding of George Melville and Bell Mortim&#xD;
taken place that morning at Mr. Mortimer&#xD;
&#xD;
silence. The ceremony was conducted by an octo-&#xD;
genarian; one who had performed a like duty I for&#xD;
Bell's parents; one who had planted' the Standard&#xD;
of the Cross in the wilderness, and under the Old&#xD;
School Presbyterian form  of religious faith, had&#xD;
fought a good 'fight and almost finished his course.&#xD;
As George and Bell knelt to receive the blessing, his'&#xD;
withered hands, as they were gently laid upon their&#xD;
foreheads, trembled with age; the eye, as it was&#xD;
upturned to Heaven, suffused with a tear, but it was&#xD;
he teardrop of a bright vision of the glorious home&#xD;
.waiting him..&#xD;
May the choicest blessings of the all-wise Crea-&#xD;
eor follow upon the pathway of thee and thine!&#xD;
Grant, oh most High, that as these thy servants shall&#xD;
remember from whence flow all earthly blessings, so&#xD;
peace, plenty, happiness, and bright immortality,&#xD;
shall be vouchsafed unto them."&#xD;
Such were the concluding words, uttered in tremu-&#xD;
lous accents, which testified before men that George&#xD;
Melville and Bell Mortimer were united in hand, as&#xD;
they had long been in heart.&#xD;
At five o'clock that afternoon, the wedding-party&#xD;
started for Auburn. There they took the evening&#xD;
train eastward.  The party consisted of George&#xD;
Melville and his lovely bride, Mr. and Mrs. Edge-&#xD;
monte, Mr. James H. Griswold, Thomas F. Griswold&#xD;
and wife, Mr. and Mrs. William Hastings, Miss Mary&#xD;
Melville, and Frederick Mortimer.&#xD;
It had been determined that the whole party&#xD;
should make a hasty trip to the points of prominent&#xD;
interest in Europe. On the morning succeeding&#xD;

their. arrival at New York, Mr. William Hastings,&#xD;
accompanied by Mr. Frederick Mortimer, while&#xD;
passing down Broadway for the purpose of visiting&#xD;
the ticket office of the principal line of American&#xD;
ocean steamers, was accosted by a gentleman, evi-&#xD;
dently an old acquaintance.&#xD;
"Ali! Mr. Hastings! Good morning," said the&#xD;
gentleman.&#xD;
"Good morning," returned Hastings, with a smile&#xD;
of pleasure.&#xD;
" I perceive by the marriage lists, Mr. Hastings,&#xD;
that you are no longer a free man in this great&#xD;
Republic."&#xD;
"The. marriage lists, my dear sir, tell a truthful&#xD;
tale," returned Hastings.&#xD;
"What.is to become of your business matters ?"&#xD;
" Oh, they must jog on without reins for a few&#xD;
months, while I take a short respite in Europe," said&#xD;
Hastings.&#xD;
"Then, you must allow me the pleasure of present-&#xD;
ing you with a free pass to and from Liverpool on my&#xD;
line of steamers, as you are, doubtless, aware one of&#xD;
them is the first to sail. No words, sir. It is my bridal&#xD;
present to the lovely Mrs. Hastings, upon whom I&#xD;
shall make it my duty, privilege, etc., to call this&#xD;
afternoon. Where is she holding levee ?"&#xD;
"At the St. Nicholas Hotel; but I cannot allow&#xD;
you to call upon her alone."&#xD;
"Afraid to trust the new wife with an old friend'&#xD;
who might be your -father? Hastings! Hastings 1"&#xD;
"NQ, no ! not that, my dear sir. You are too fast.&#xD;
You will find a large party at the hotel, all looking&#xD;
eastward across the Atlantic."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Who are they, sir ?" inquired the gentleman.&#xD;
" Mr. and Mrs. Edgemonte," said Hastings.&#xD;
"Ain't afraid to face them.  Edgemonte is an&#xD;
honest man, and his wife-never mind. I knew her&#xD;
at sixteen."&#xD;
" Mr. James H. Griswold," continued Hastings.&#xD;
"Has the best credit of any merchant in New&#xD;
York. Catfish: Railroad stock came out all right.&#xD;
Is worth half a million, and lends me any amount I&#xD;
want when the money market is close. Guess I can&#xD;
stand under his batteries. .Anybody else ?"&#xD;
"Thomas F. Griswold and Clara, his beautiful and&#xD;
accomplished"&#xD;
"Wife, sir !-wife! trotted her a baby on my knee,&#xD;
and kissedher when she vowed to love, honor, and--&#xD;
didn't hear the, obey. Who else ?"&#xD;
" Mrs. William Hastings "--&#xD;
" Of course, Mr. Hastings ; unless you see fit to&#xD;
put up the bars and keep an old friend out of the&#xD;
field in a fit of young-husband-jealousy. Who is to&#xD;
wind up the party?$"&#xD;
"Miss Mary Melville and Mr. Frederick Morti-&#xD;
mer."&#xD;
"Molly Melville, of Edgartown ?"&#xD;
"Yes," replied Hastings.&#xD;
"I shall ask George Melville, who planned and&#xD;
built the machinery for my new steamship, to intro-&#xD;
duce me to her, if he ever returns to business. I've&#xD;
called on him twenty times, and his partner, Carter,&#xD;
saysahe thinks he has deserted the city for good. But&#xD;
who is this Mr. Frederick Mortimer? dare 'saysome&#xD;
one full of nonsense, who wants to marry Molly Mel&#xD;
ville. He can't get her "&#xD;

"Allow me to interrupt you, my dear sir, and let&#xD;
Mr. Mortimer speak for. himself," said Hastings, as&#xD;
soon as he could speak, with a very wicked twinkle&#xD;
about the eye, introducing Frederick Mortimer to his&#xD;
friend, as the son of the Hon. B. F. Mortimer.&#xD;
"Laugh--no use ! You have not caught me. I&#xD;
know Mortimer, too. Ben Mortimer and I have had&#xD;
some hard fights, shoulder to shoulder, in Washing-&#xD;
ton, alto let American enterprise have a fair oppor-&#xD;
tunity to make headway, and assert her ability .to&#xD;
compete with the tough mariners of old England.&#xD;
Never mind-the thick-headed policy of some legis-&#xD;
lators, sooner or later, will lead them out where King&#xD;
Nebuchadnezzar went and remained seven years; or,&#xD;
as angry Jonathan Slick expressed it, 'they wi1 all&#xD;
go to grass.' Well, I can face the chip oftthe old&#xD;
Mortimer. block, if he will let me," said Hastings'&#xD;
friend. "That's all the leaven in the batch, is it ?&#xD;
"Not quite !" said Hastings.&#xD;
"Who else, then? come! I'm getting warm after&#xD;
my long speech on American ocean navigation&#xD;
policy."&#xD;
"'The man you have called on twenty times at his'&#xD;
office is there," said Hastings.&#xD;
"'George Melville ?"&#xD;
"Yes !" replied Hastings, with a smile.&#xD;
"Then I am going there, anyhow. Any one else ?&#xD;
asked his friend. "Come! I'm getting almost des-&#xD;
prate.&#xD;
"Bell Mortimer-that was," said Hastings.&#xD;
"Bell Mortimer that was? And who is Dell Mor-&#xD;
timer that is, pray ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. George Melville."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Whew !" and Hastings' friend gave a whistle of&#xD;
most immoderate length. Then, turning on his heel,&#xD;
assuming a very sober countenance, and putting on&#xD;
some pseudodignified manners, he nodded to the two&#xD;
young men, very stiffly. "Tell your party that my&#xD;
new steamship sails day after to-morrow at 12, &amp;amp;.,&#xD;
precisely, for Liverpool. Tell them they go as my&#xD;
guests'; that the ship is at their service; and, that I&#xD;
would like an invitation to accompany the party.&#xD;
That's all. I sha'n't call at the St. Nicholas until I&#xD;
receive the invitation. George Melville !-married !&#xD;
Built my best machinery! Splendid fellow! Good&#xD;
mechanic! Ain't a fool!-. Got a good wife! Ben&#xD;
Mortimer's got to go, too !" And down Broadway&#xD;
posted this citizen ocean sovereign-a man to whose&#xD;
energies, industry, and enterprise, the whole Ameri-&#xD;
can nation owes a debt which can only be paid when&#xD;
the green-sward covers his form. On the spot which&#xD;
shall hold his remains will be kindled a spark that&#xD;
shall inflame the pride of true Americans, to emulate&#xD;
his fame, as they contemplate the moral and prac-&#xD;
tical worth of his deeds:&#xD;
The invitation to call at the St. Nicholas was duly&#xD;
forwarded, and the commands of Hastings' friend to&#xD;
be at pier No. -, on the North River, at 12, M., on&#xD;
the Saturday following, were obeyed. Hon. B. F.&#xD;
Mortimer and wife accepted the invitation, and joined&#xD;
the party, just as the noble vessel was about to leave&#xD;
her pier. When fairly in the stream, her loud-boom-&#xD;
ing ordnance bade farewell to:the thousands assem-&#xD;
bled on the wharf to witness the departure of the&#xD;
magnificent craft.&#xD;
Here we take leave of these estimable friends,&#xD;

Mary Wilcox was not one. to forget those who had&#xD;
helped her in need., To force ari act of justice, Sarah&#xD;
E. Graham had perilled her life, and sacrificed that&#xD;
beauty of form and feature, which are prizes of rich&#xD;
value to the true woman. Sarah resisted every effort&#xD;
made by Mary Wilcox, to repay her kindness. At&#xD;
last, Mary,. by the assistance of J. S. Taylor and&#xD;
.Thomas F. Griswold, Esquires, who had become part-&#xD;
ners in the legal profession, settled upon Sarah an&#xD;
estate of twenty-five thousand dollars. .Sarah has&#xD;
devoted her life to acts of kindness and benevolence&#xD;
in emulation of the example of the good Samaritan.&#xD;
Frederick Mortimer is so fearful that he cannot&#xD;
obtain any one equal to his lost Bell, that he studiously&#xD;
avoids committing matrimony ; and matri-money he&#xD;
is above attempting.&#xD;

AN OUTSIDE VIEW OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS,&#xD;
AND THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE&#xD;
AMERICAN PEOPLE.&#xD;
A. Book of extraordinary power and interest will soon be&#xD;
published in this city, entitled&#xD;
SHAHYIAH IN PURSUIT OF FREEDOM;&#xD;
OR,&#xD;
THE BRANDED HAND.&#xD;
That an instinctive love of freedom is inhaled in the very&#xD;
atmosphere of mountainous countries, will not be questioned by&#xD;
any~ close observer of mankind; it, therefore, is not surprising&#xD;
that there should exist a race, even among the mountainous por-&#xD;
tions of Algeria, which should furnish owu earnest seeker after&#xD;
a true freedom.&#xD;
Shahmah was not only a superior. specimen of his race, but&#xD;
such an enthusiast had he become.in his admiration of freedom,&#xD;
that he early resolved to make it the study of his life.  During&#xD;
his collegiate studies, having formed the acquaintance of an&#xD;
American gentleman who kindly furnished him with a copy of&#xD;
the Declaration of American Independence, and .gave him a&#xD;
glowing description of the beauties of our "Free Institutions,"&#xD;
he at once resolved to visit our land, in order to become inti-&#xD;
mately acquainted with the interior working of a system founded&#xD;
on such a perfect basis.&#xD;
In his straightforward simplicity of character and earnestness&#xD;
of purpose, he of course finds great difficulty in reconciling his&#xD;
preconceived. opinions with the manners and customs of the&#xD;
country ; but his is not a heart to faint at the appearance of&#xD;
apparent obstacles, and while he sees things as they are,,he does&#xD;
not lose his faith in the possibilities of the future.&#xD;
There is a freshness about his narrative that none but a highly&#xD;
gifted mind, from his peculiar standpoint, could attain, rendering&#xD;
the book extremely fascinating to the lover of;romance, while it&#xD;
affords the deepest study to the philosopher, and opens a rich&#xD;
field of prophecy to the lover of his race.&#xD;
In short, it is a book that will touch the hearts of the people,&#xD;
and will have its Ahousands of readers and admirers.&#xD;
