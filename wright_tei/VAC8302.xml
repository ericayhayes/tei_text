CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"Coming! Gracious Heavens 1" My-&#xD;
relda started nervously up.  The letter&#xD;
in her small hand trembled, and a wild-&#xD;
rose hue fluttered over her animated face.&#xD;
Her eyes sparkled-with an excited light.&#xD;
" He is coming!" Her lips compressed&#xD;
firmly, -and a half-smile lurked in the&#xD;
dimpled corners of her dainty mouth.&#xD;
" He is coming I" It was the third ex-&#xD;
clamation, and with it a pallor overspread&#xD;
the speaker's face. The truth of the as-&#xD;
sertiOn, contained in the\letterher slen-&#xD;
der fingers grasped, till the red blood&#xD;
lied from the taper points, seemed then,&#xD;
to beifully realized. *She stepped quiM-&#xD;
ly over the soft carpet, and swept aside&#xD;
the window-drapery, with an impulsive&#xD;
force that detached a ring from the cor-&#xD;
nice. She looked up and smiled. The&#xD;
smile widened, from the parted lips, and&#xD;
diffused :its sunshine brightness over the&#xD;
uplifted face, as she contemplated the&#xD;
result of her .unconscious impetuosity,&#xD;
till a clear laugh, low but musical, broke&#xD;
the silence of her little chamber. , The,&#xD;
heart-gush floated-away---way through&#xD;
the dusky, lattice, apd died out upon the.&#xD;
hazy autumn air; and a ;sober, serious'&#xD;
expression settled down upon the deeply&#xD;
pensive face. The transitionwas strange-&#xD;
ly, sudden. The change was like bril'&#xD;
1iantlau p extinguish deeetually, with-&#xD;
&#xD;
out a single symptom of previous exis-&#xD;
tence, by an unexpected waft of night&#xD;
wind.. The eyes were dark and dreamy,&#xD;
and no inner -light glimmered up from&#xD;
the silent cloister of her immateriiheing&#xD;
She was a "strange creature"--ly-&#xD;
relda Montford-"past finding out; cold&#xD;
as an iceberg; capricious, callous, and&#xD;
coquettish"---so said "the world."&#xD;
Myrelda smiled at the whisper, and a&#xD;
spice of scorn was in the transient soul.&#xD;
gleaming.&#xD;
"Strange." Myrelda assented tothat;&#xD;
it Was her ambition to live above the&#xD;
world :while she lived in it., She was&#xD;
strangely unlike the common herd;,their&#xD;
"ways were not her ways, neither were&#xD;
their thoughts her thoughts." There&#xD;
was no feeling in common between them,&#xD;
and the world was incapable of compre-&#xD;
bending her. The world doffed its beav-&#xD;
er, deferentially, as she passed, with an&#xD;
ever-living smile upon her calm face,&#xD;
and looked after her, as she stepped firm-&#xD;
ly and proudly onward, with thee cla-&#xD;
mation: "Lovely and sifted, but hound&#xD;
up-in a cocoon of selfishness. When will&#xD;
the nun-spirit burst the crysalis of re-&#xD;
serve and retiracy, and bask in the sun-&#xD;
shine of social life."&#xD;
Myrelda went quietly onward,-repe-&#xD;
ing softly: " nunuam minas solus, g m&#xD;
uum .solas."&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
" Past finding out." She said. "Put&#xD;
not your trust in princes, nor in the son&#xD;
of man, in whom there is no help," and,&#xD;
she only unclosed the door of her confi-&#xD;
dence and faith to Him who knoweth&#xD;
the secrets of the heart, and "judges&#xD;
righteous judgement.',&#xD;
" Cold as an iceberg." Myrelda look-&#xD;
ed up at the broad, blue sky, and down&#xD;
upon the sweet blossoms-the Angels'&#xD;
alphabet--in the green grass; and off&#xD;
at the sparkling waters singing a lullaby&#xD;
at the foot of the hazy hill, and the&#xD;
rich blood rippled up from a full hidden&#xD;
fountain, and left a warm painting of&#xD;
beauty and brightnessupon either cheek.&#xD;
"Coquettish !" The scorn stood out,&#xD;
prominently, upon her slightly curled&#xD;
lip, as she arrived at this point. How&#xD;
had she incurred this imputation ?  She&#xD;
had never trifled with the tender sensi-&#xD;
bilities of a human being ; on the con-&#xD;
trary, she had nipped, in the bud, every&#xD;
spontaneous springing of affection, de-&#xD;
tected in, a heart destined, through her&#xD;
own incapacity, to reciprocate the feel-&#xD;
ing, to wither in the wintry winds of&#xD;
rejection, if expressed. She had never&#xD;
subjected an admirer to the mortification&#xD;
of a refusal, if his eyes were loyal to his&#xD;
judgment; and yet even he-the stern,&#xD;
the proud, the unseen, daringfriend of&#xD;
three years' correspondence-had boldly&#xD;
applied to her this hated termI What&#xD;
was there, in her seeming or nature, that&#xD;
snacked of coquetry ? She would be&#xD;
revengd ! He was coming! Myrel-&#xD;
da's heart quivered as she thought of&#xD;
their first-meeting. How would she de-&#xD;
portierself? Slhem:treybled for her self-&#xD;
possession in his proud presence, when&#xD;
the anticipation of his coming, thus un-&#xD;
nerved her.  &amp;amp;  should not-triumph;&#xD;
she would be "an iceberg," in truth.&#xD;
She set her lips firmly together, and look-&#xD;
ed invi Bible. He was coming, with the&#xD;
avowed,purpose of "winning her; of sub-&#xD;
&#xD;
jugating and enslaving her whole soul  -&#xD;
'She could not help liking him, though&#xD;
he was neither handsome nor rich. He&#xD;
loved her, and was determined to win'&#xD;
Too long, she had lived in "fancy free,"&#xD;
and tortured the faint hearts of his sex;&#xD;
he would guarantee to revenge the whole&#xD;
pusillanimous set, by one fell swoop of&#xD;
his irresistible power. He would clip&#xD;
the wings of the coquettish Southern&#xD;
songster, and imprison her in a matri-&#xD;
monial cage, to be hung up among the&#xD;
perfume and roses of his Northern bow&#xD;
er-sure. He could no longer live with-&#xD;
out her. She had provoked him into&#xD;
loving her with a fond intensity that was&#xD;
wasting him to a shadow. His friends&#xD;
could hardly recognize him as the ro-&#xD;
bust, free-and-easy, Herbert Hamilton&#xD;
of three years agong ! Would she send&#xD;
him her likeness? He wanted it to&#xD;
comfort him, in his distress, until he&#xD;
could make arrangements for emigrat&#xD;
ing to her vicinity, in order to lay siege&#xD;
to her cruel heart. He knew the fortress&#xD;
would fall down, before the first glance&#xD;
of his adoringgeyes, as effectually as the,&#xD;
walls of an ancient city at the blast of&#xD;
the 'Israilites' trumpets; but he .dispair-&#xD;
ed of subduing her and bringing her to&#xD;
terms until he attacked her rebel heart&#xD;
in propria persona. Would she send&#xD;
him her beautiful semblance ?"&#xD;
"No, she wouldn't; she was not beauti-&#xD;
tiful, and must decline having her&#xD;
homely physiognomy ridiculed by the&#xD;
deceitful attorney.. She had rno faith in&#xD;
lawyers-not one whit; wouldn't believe&#xD;
he loved her until he confirmed the asser-&#xD;
tion by making his 'quietus with a bare&#xD;
bodkin,' in order to prove his sincerity."&#xD;
He fretted and fumed., She was a&#xD;
cruel, soulless imp, raised on vinegar and&#xD;
lignun vitae; her acidity had taken all&#xD;
the edge off his delicious anticipations&#xD;
of Wearing her sweet shadow upon his&#xD;
.fond heart, until he could clasp the pre-&#xD;
&#xD;
cious substance there to relieve its an&#xD;
ions achings; Would she never be s&#xD;
rious, and trust him?  He was hone&#xD;
as the day was long, and true to a co:&#xD;
fiding friend as the needle to the pol&#xD;
He knew she was beautiful, but th&#xD;
wasn't of the slightest consequence ;&#xD;
she were ugly as she would have hi&#xD;
believe, he would prize her minatui&#xD;
above rubies, because of the proud, pur&#xD;
soul that was in the dear original.&#xD;
was that he wanted, and that he was di&#xD;
termined to win. He had been inform&#xD;
ed she was " rich, handsome and talent&#xD;
ed ;" the last he knew, the others h&#xD;
cared nothing about, only hoped sh&#xD;
was rich for her own sake, because s&#xD;
good a girl deserved the choicest bless&#xD;
ings that heaven could bestow, among&#xD;
which money had a place. Wealth wa&#xD;
convenient, doubtless, but then that con&#xD;
sideratioa wouldn't weigh a feather it&#xD;
feather. in choosing a partner-not&#xD;
feather. Similarity of disposition, con&#xD;
geniality of sentiment, a sameness o&#xD;
taste, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., were what he should seek&#xD;
for; and he should want a woman with&#xD;
a good share of common sense, of refine-&#xD;
ment, genuine politeness, generous true&#xD;
pride, such as a man might justly be&#xD;
proud of; without vanity,; and above all&#xD;
loving, constant and lovable. If, with&#xD;
these, she had money, it would be well;&#xD;
if not, just as well."&#xD;
Myrelda leaned her head against the&#xD;
window-side. The bland breeze blew back&#xD;
the clustering curls behind her small&#xD;
ears; and the old soul-full smile leaped&#xD;
out upon her red lips, as she retrospect-&#xD;
ed the past.&#xD;
Three years they had kept up a con-&#xD;
tinuous fire of repartee, sarcasm and bit-&#xD;
ter irony. The sharp points of their&#xD;
" glittering steel" pens had been thrust&#xD;
into each other's patience and pride, till&#xD;
endurance leaked out of the wound, and&#xD;
they mutually quarrelled and quit.&#xD;

to take the extended hand of the sup-&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
Myrelda drew her rocking chair to&#xD;
the window, where the soft south breeze&#xD;
drifted the light drapery on the purple&#xD;
twilight, and sank down dreamily among&#xD;
the crimson cushions. Her small head&#xD;
fell languidly back, and the black lashes&#xD;
drooped over the dark, clear, and half&#xD;
smiling eyes. She was delicately love-&#xD;
ly as she thus reclined ; the round, white&#xD;
cheeks'looked white and more transpar-&#xD;
ent still, contrasted with the dark ver-&#xD;
million background, and the rich clus-&#xD;
te of golden brown curls, behind her&#xD;
t little sea-shell like ears, crushed for-&#xD;
ward by the cushions, formed a glittering&#xD;
bed of varying hues, for her soft plump&#xD;
ohin.&#xD;
A new era seemed about:to dawn up-&#xD;
on her existence. She held in her heart&#xD;
a presentiment of some great event, from&#xD;
which all future events were to be reck-&#xD;
oned. Myrelda could not have defined&#xD;
her feelings, had she sat down by her&#xD;
writing-desk, and essayed to wreathe.&#xD;
them up in rhyme or plain prose ; they&#xD;
were vivid, yet intangible--palpable, but&#xD;
not to be grasped. She looked back&#xD;
through the dim vista of the past, and&#xD;
came slowly and retrospectively up the&#xD;
long aisle of the by-gone, from the hap-&#xD;
py days of her childhood up to the pre-&#xD;
sent hour. Her fair face changed its&#xD;
expression frequently, as she,'turned over&#xD;
again, with the fingers of memory, the&#xD;
closed leaves of her departed years; her&#xD;
life had been strange, and ah ! so sad.&#xD;
All the sunshine of her days lay behind&#xD;
her seventeenth year-this side, all was&#xD;
blackness and sorrow. That golden an-&#xD;
&#xD;
niversary was a deep gulf opened up in&#xD;
her heart-history, by loving " not wise-&#xD;
ly, but too well," over which the pale&#xD;
lamp of memory was suspended by the&#xD;
chain of regret, and threw, evermore,&#xD;
its-feeble rays upon the wreck of her&#xD;
girlish heart, hopes far down in the dark&#xD;
abyss. Myrelda shuddered as she look-&#xD;
ed down the chasm, and repeated aloud:&#xD;
"The wounded bird, blown o'er the deep,&#xD;
would sooner quit the shore,&#xD;
Than I would cross the gulf again&#xD;
That Time has brought me o'er."&#xD;
Myrelda Montford was an onlydaugh-&#xD;
ter-the pet and pride of her parents&#xD;
and only brother; beautiful in infancy&#xD;
and childhood, and bewitchingly Iyely&#xD;
when the bright bud of adolescence ex-&#xD;
panded into the fresh flower of early&#xD;
womanhood. Extremely wealthy,,and f&#xD;
noble lineage, her little barque, freighted&#xD;
with an immortal 'gem, glided peaceful-&#xD;
ly, upon the calm waves of affectionate&#xD;
care, until it stranded in the great ocean&#xD;
of first love, upon the rock of cupidity.&#xD;
Her beauty and wealth drew to her feet&#xD;
suitors by the score, and from that sup-&#xD;
pliant train she chose the most unwor-&#xD;
thy.&#xD;
Lovely herself, she was attracted by a&#xD;
corresponding exterior, and breathed herl&#xD;
vow of betrothal to one whose only&#xD;
charms consisted in a fascinating pw-&#xD;
sonnel-one wholly destitute of themag-&#xD;
netism of mind that can, alone, retain&#xD;
affection.&#xD;
A sudden revulsion of fortune reduq-&#xD;
ed her from affluence to comparative&#xD;
poverty, and the sweet June eves that&#xD;
should have witnessed her bridal,,shed&#xD;
its tears of round dew upon her young&#xD;
head, as she wandered alone and deoe$-&#xD;

and plunipness, and her eye of its wont-&#xD;

her heart=remainedefolded in a shroud&#xD;

she kneel beside the fount of Helicon,&#xD;

The flowers of her early hopes lay with-&#xD;

ately;- taidly and with the utmost ap-&#xD;
parent indifference respecting the pres-&#xD;
deice of the stranger occupant.  Her&#xD;
dark eyes rested upon the glowing grate&#xD;
'with a calm, cool and self-possessed&#xD;
seeming as though that were the most&#xD;
imiportait object in the small apartment,&#xD;
She truedd  them  quietly  and half-&#xD;
dreanily upon the tall majestic form&#xD;
of her visitor, as he rose with grave&#xD;
dignity, and advanced slowly towards&#xD;
her. Her calmness, partially deserted&#xD;
her as she met the deep, dark and search-&#xD;
ing eyes of Herbert Hamilton, for the&#xD;
first time. She was provoked by his&#xD;
self-possesion and sober air; she had&#xD;
anticipated a far different 'appearance,&#xD;
in -her bol.;and daring stranger lover;&#xD;
she had expected to screen her pertur-&#xD;

a k's;from herded' lips at first sight;&#xD;
he mould take her in his arms, and&#xD;
4ess'-her to- as fond a''heart as ever&#xD;
throbbed in mortal breast."  An effort&#xD;
to perform that vow would' have afford-&#xD;
ed a plausible excuse for her agitation;,&#xD;
now she had rione. His calmness and&#xD;
grave deportment, tilted her equanim-&#xD;
ity,uand a 'deep blush of excitement&#xD;
inantled her cheeks, as she laid her&#xD;
hand in"his extended one. An'instant&#xD;
it  as pressed very tightly within his&#xD;
'n; the ext, it lay 'carelessly "upon&#xD;
his soft, warm palm.' He stood silent&#xD;
andgrave, locking 'don upon her 'rosy&#xD;
tacse--no word  as 'spoken"as'yet.&#xD;
Myrelda ttemeptd to'ithdraw '1hr&#xD;
-hand, but his fingers closed around it&#xD;
&#xD;
again, and prevented her.  She looked&#xD;
up into his calm, earnest eyes, and a&#xD;
second 'blush, twin sister of the first,&#xD;
rushed 'to her cheeks. Matters were&#xD;
growing deperate with Myrelda;; the si-&#xD;
lence was oppressive. Where- was her&#xD;
boasted heroism, her strong, self-reliant'&#xD;
soul ? She strove to regain composure&#xD;
and a half-frown became apparent on&#xD;
her brow in the effort.&#xD;
" Be seated, if you please, Mr. Ham-&#xD;
ilton," she at length said, with a slight-,&#xD;
ly quivering voice.&#xD;
He made no movement to accept the&#xD;
invitation, but releasing her hand, cross-&#xD;
ed his arms behind him and stood state-&#xD;
ly and-grim, still bending upon her that&#xD;
deep indefinable gaze.&#xD;
"I will sit here no more, Miss Mont-&#xD;
ford, till I have the assurance that I&#xD;
am not an unwelcome intruder."&#xD;
Myrelda's strength had now almost&#xD;
deserted her, and with its absence a&#xD;
deathly paleness overspread her face.&#xD;
"You are not sir," she faltered.&#xD;
"That will not suffice Miss Montford;&#xD;
We have been friends three years, and&#xD;
yet, at my first appearance you offer me&#xD;
no word of welcome."&#xD;
I extend it now, Mr. Hamilton; a&#xD;
friend is ever welcome, and the suppo-&#xD;
sition that the pleasure of this privi-&#xD;
lege would be understood, must be -my&#xD;
apology for not sooner expressing it."&#xD;
She was trembling, visibly; had she&#xD;
looked up, the 'sly, exhtilting smile,&#xD;
lurking in the corners of his large dark&#xD;
eyes, would speedily have restored her.&#xD;
self-possession ; it was the strangeness,&#xD;
the unexpected solemnity and reserve&#xD;
of the scene that unnerved her.&#xD;
" During  my epistolary 'acquaint-&#xD;

yowcharacter." He led her to a seat as&#xD;
lie spoke, passing his arm around her&#xD;
slender waist as asupport, as he felt&#xD;
her slight form quivering beneath the&#xD;
hand upon her arm, and the same vic-&#xD;
torious smile shone in his half-veiled eyes.&#xD;
Myrelda    would have been annoyed&#xD;
to the life ha she seen that smile; in&#xD;
all her past history she could not re-&#xD;
member the time when she had 'been so&#xD;
provoked with herself. It had been&#xD;
her best effort since their first acquain-&#xD;
tance, to equal him in coldness, blunt&#xD;
ness and sarcasm, and she had always&#xD;
succeeded till now, when she most de-&#xD;
sired it. She tried to rally her powers,&#xD;
and her fast varying countenance be-&#xD;
trayed her mental excitement.&#xD;
He sat beside her, and Myrelda felt&#xD;
his dark eyes rivetted upon her face ;&#xD;
she fixed her own upon the red grate&#xD;
with pertinacious silence.&#xD;
"How very unlike the portrait my&#xD;
imagination painted of you," he said&#xD;
provokingly; "I fancied a tall, blue-&#xD;
eyed, golden-haired woman, with a full&#xD;
sunny faceand merry laugh everlastingly&#xD;
ringing from her red mouth; that was&#xD;
the impression I got from your private&#xD;
letters-no matter about the effect of&#xD;
your published articles. I find you wear&#xD;
two faces, Miss 'Montford; which is the&#xD;
more truthful, the public or private ?"&#xD;
" And no matter about the truthful,&#xD;
Mr. Hamilton; I can compete with you&#xD;
in that respect, either in public or pri-&#xD;
vate," she glanced at his face, and look-&#xD;
ed indignantly sober.&#xD;
"Because I misled you with refer-&#xD;
ence to my personal appearance ? Now do&#xD;
me'the justice to confess I uttered no&#xD;
untruth, even though' the real differs&#xD;
from your ideal."&#xD;
Myrelda was compelled to acknow-'&#xD;
ledge the fact, but she only did it i en-a&#xD;
tally.&#xD;
&#xD;
". But duplicity is falsehood at last,&#xD;
Mr. Hamilton."&#xD;
" Only reprehensible according to its&#xD;
results, Miss Montford, else you were&#xD;
exceedingly culpable."&#xD;
" How, sir ?"&#xD;
" Your present appearance indicates&#xD;
great gravity of mind, and yet, were&#xD;
you replying to my letter, in lieu of con-&#xD;
versing face to face, you would let loose&#xD;
a battery of levity and bitter iron-y at&#xD;
my poor head. that would make it illus-&#xD;
trate the law of gravitation as a neces-&#xD;
sary consequence."&#xD;
"Myrelda had recourse to her hand-&#xD;
kerchief to hide the irrepressible smile&#xD;
upon her lips. She looked up gravely.&#xD;
" Circumstances affect our mood, Mr.&#xD;
Hamilton; if. I did, it would not be&#xD;
with a view to deceive."&#xD;
"Do you never attempt to deceive,&#xD;
fair lady."&#xD;
Myrelda colored.&#xD;
" Not from motives that conscience&#xD;
condemns, sir."&#xD;
"Precisely, just what I was contend-&#xD;
ing for; my conscience never chastised&#xD;
me for misleading you."&#xD;
"But some consciences are terribly&#xD;
elastic, Mr. Hamilton, and lengthen to&#xD;
suit the convenience of the proprietor."&#xD;
"lMake a self-application of that, if&#xD;
you please, before handing it oyer for&#xD;
my appropriation."&#xD;
Myrelda laughed unavoidably, at the&#xD;
glance that accompanied these words;&#xD;
it seemed so like the Herbert Hamilton&#xD;
of her dreams.&#xD;
"There ! I knew there was sunshine&#xD;
in that soul, and I have drawn it out, at&#xD;
last, Dc you rarely smile, Miss ]Iont-&#xD;
ford Z"&#xD;
" When the inducement is sufficient,&#xD;

"Then the fact of my presence was&#xD;
not sufficient cause, when you entered&#xD;

I 'BS t you had not seenme."&#xD;

"Ah !"   Myrelda blushed, beneath&#xD;
the grave, but intelligent glance he bent&#xD;
upon er. "Thenyouo are not pleased&#xD;
with am  appearance, Miss Montford?&#xD;
I thought you were regardless of ex-&#xD;
tetiors,-and that you deemed the soul,&#xD;
puly, worthy of eompideration.'&#xD;
"I do; sir:&#xD;
"Then you think me destitute-of&#xD;
both mental and physical 'attractio ?"&#xD;
Myrelda looked 'indignantly up,nud&#xD;
turned her ,eyes askance, upon his&#xD;
physiognomy. -&#xD;
"iI consider any face. devoid of at-&#xD;
fraction, sir, that-sports such a super-&#xD;
fluity as the one before me;&amp;amp; and you&#xD;
were not ignorant of some of my dis,&#xD;
likes."&#xD;
"I was not convinced of your pre-&#xD;
judice against the superfluity alluded to.&#xD;
at apy rate, young lady ; and even had&#xD;
I been, would you expect .me to sacri-&#xD;
tie my feelings to humor your whim?"&#xD;
My relda blushed crimson; the scar-&#xD;
let blood even tinged her little ears.&#xD;
She rased her ieady'proudly, and turn.&#xD;
ed, "er luminous eyes; unflinchingly,&#xD;
upon his.&#xD;
"I would not, sir; Iexpect, and ask&#xD;
no sacrifice on your'part from, any con-'&#xD;
sidet tiens f myself; but you required&#xD;
a reason for my grave reception, and I'&#xD;
gave it. I always, before, thought that&#xD;
head too well filled with sound sense, to&#xD;
be under the necessity,' of hanging out&#xD;
the }sign ef Apartmeits to let!'&#xD;
Tb9 dark eyes riveted upon her face,&#xD;
were brimful of mirth, but no sound of&#xD;
risibility escaped him; and Myrelda re-&#xD;
main ed'ignorant of his-humor, as her,&#xD;
face :had bent, during the speech, to-&#xD;
wards the caret. He remained silent&#xD;
a moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Thank you for the compliment your,&#xD;
faiey paid ne, Miss Montford, I see,&#xD;
now, that your sentiments real cor-&#xD;
respond with my ,own."&#xD;
He' rose andwalked from her-raised&#xD;
his hand, and ran his fingers through&#xD;
the raven rings of hair, above his mas-&#xD;
sive forehead; when he turned, -the&#xD;
jetty moustache had disappeared. My-&#xD;
relda's eyes evinced her astonishment,&#xD;
and a quick flush of evident pleasure&#xD;
rippled over her face. He returned&#xD;
and sat down gravely beside her.&#xD;
"Do you like me better, now, Miss&#xD;
Montford ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," she answered frankly and&#xD;
soberly.&#xD;
" Convince me of the fact, then."&#xD;
"How, sir?"&#xD;
"By throwing off that reserved air,&#xD;
and giving me one smile-such a smile&#xD;
as you only, can give.",&#xD;
Myrelda raised her eyes to his, and a,&#xD;
gush of genuine heart-sunshine spark-&#xD;
led over her face, as she asked, archly;&#xD;
" How do you know nay capacity, in&#xD;
that respect, Mr. Hamilton ?"&#xD;
" How do I know that you have a&#xD;
soul,' whose strings can 'vibrate sweetest&#xD;
pleasure,', or 'thrill the deepest notes of&#xD;
Her eyes fell, beneath the expressive&#xD;
glance of his. She sat silent and sedate&#xD;
fearing lest her voice should betray her&#xD;
mental emotion. An egnbarrassing pause&#xD;
ensued, her face grew warm from the&#xD;
stillness.&#xD;
"And you would not marry a man&#xD;
who sported such a superfluity ?" he.&#xD;
asked, softly.&#xD;
"I could never think him possessed&#xD;
of a great soul,. Mr. Hamilton; 'and&#xD;
censequently I could not trust him. It&#xD;
is, and ever has been one of my deepest&#xD;
prejudices; the mouth is more indicative&#xD;
of character than, any other feature,&#xD;
and when that is disfigured and con-&#xD;
&#xD;
cealed by such a derogating appendage,&#xD;
the countenance, in my estimation, wears&#xD;
a stolid and savage appearance-there&#xD;
is nothing lovable in it, but everything&#xD;
repellant."&#xD;
He smiled.&#xD;
.." Then you thougltt me very repuj&#xD;
sive? do you now, Myrelda ?" he utt -&#xD;
ed her christian name for the first tinie,&#xD;
with.a softness and tender cadence, that&#xD;
that unnerved her again, and deepened&#xD;
the rose on her. cheek. She laughed&#xD;
lightly, to screen her trepidation, and&#xD;
rooked coyly up,&#xD;
"No, sir; Iam not afraid of you, now,i&#xD;
for .a heathen!  But, pray, why dids&#xD;
you take the trouble to render yourself&#xD;
so formidable, since you repudiate the 1&#xD;
means-?"&#xD;
"I 'had a motive, Miss Montford."&#xD;
He had relapsed into his former grave r&#xD;
and reserved bearing. .V&#xD;
Myrelda was awed again, and the&#xD;
radiance faded from her countenance. f&#xD;
"I desire no' explanation, sir," she&#xD;
said, proudly.                       v&#xD;
He sat silent and solemn, regarding&#xD;
her attentively.,&#xD;
' If your love is, so easily affected by&#xD;
external appearances, you should never si&#xD;
become a wife; the soul, only, can&#xD;
secure happiness in that sacred relation y4&#xD;
-that may be 'beautiful abd true' ~&#xD;
whatever be the outward seeming."   to&#xD;
Myreida was deeply chagrined, and b&#xD;
embarrassed by his manner and lan-&#xD;
guage; her pride rose to its full altitude. je&#xD;
" .You are not justifiable in such an s~&#xD;
insinuation, sir. You must first prove gl&#xD;
that my love has been affected by ex- co&#xD;
ternal appearances. I know that per-&#xD;
sonal beauty may charm the eye, but it 'as&#xD;
cannot fix the heart-the soul only, can&#xD;
inspire love;, I have learned that from  vo&#xD;
experience, Mr. Hamilton."           W&#xD;
Experience! how ?" he asked, quick- fla&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I once fancied I loved, sir, one&#xD;
whose' mental deficiency too soon con-&#xD;
vinced me I had constructed my hope&#xD;
and  happiness castle upon a 'sandy&#xD;
foundation,' that has taught me to re-&#xD;
gard the mind as-alone worthy of hom-&#xD;
age-as the only magnet that can re-&#xD;
tain esteem and affection."&#xD;
"Then I have been addressing one&#xD;
whose heart-garden has been rifled of its&#xD;
first bloom of girlhood ?"&#xD;
Myrelda remained-serious and silent.&#xD;
"'Silence gives consent,' Miss Mont.&#xD;
ford. And whoever wins that heart&#xD;
now, must take it second-handed!" he&#xD;
said, coolly.&#xD;
"Yes, sir."  She was growing warm&#xD;
by his seeming hauteur.&#xD;
"Good Loid !" he ejaculated.&#xD;
Myrelda kept her eyes fixed 4on the&#xD;
red coals, but her face grew fearfully&#xD;
white,&#xD;
" You never informed me of this be-&#xD;
ore, Miss Montford !"&#xD;
She raised her head proudly, with a&#xD;
ery slight curl of the'lip.&#xD;
"I d   not consider it obligatory up-&#xD;
n me, to make a confession to you, sir.'&#xD;
He laid his arm behind her, upon the&#xD;
ofa.&#xD;
"True-.-I had no right to demand&#xD;
,ur confidence; I beg your pardon,&#xD;
Miss Montford ; but there is no barrier&#xD;
forming    second attachment ?" he&#xD;
ent slightly, and looked in her eyes.&#xD;
Had Myrelda held her feelings sub-&#xD;
ct to her will, he would not have&#xD;
miled so triumphantly, at'the blush his&#xD;
ance provoked. She sat silent and&#xD;
infused.&#xD;
"Do you love him yet, Myrelda ?" he&#xD;
ked, gently.&#xD;
"I do not, Mr. Hamilton."     Her&#xD;
ice was clear and emphatic ; her head&#xD;

shed with a liquid light.&#xD;

earnestly into her eyes.&#xD;
, "May not the past justify the deed ?&#xD;
Shrink from me-and the die is cast.".&#xD;
. Myrelder trembled; her heart would&#xD;
not permit her to reject him so emphati-&#xD;
cally.'- his presence had strengthened&#xD;
the partiality that had gradually deep=&#xD;
ened through the past three years; like&#xD;
the maelstrom, he-had drawn her nearer&#xD;
and nearer, around the circumference of&#xD;
his influence, until now, she struggled&#xD;
in the very centre of his magical-power.&#xD;
She durst not remove from his circling&#xD;
arm, although die had uttered no word&#xD;
of love, but, on the   contrary, had&#xD;
evinced disappointment ather confession.&#xD;
",B   I am not in the present, what&#xD;
you deemed me in the past, Mr. Hamil-&#xD;
ton; what you find me to be, effaces&#xD;
what has been.' She moved from him&#xD;
quietly, and with modest dignity, with&#xD;
this delicate apology.&#xD;
A smile of strange brightness swept&#xD;
over his. face., 'He drew her back to&#xD;
her former position,.with grave!respect,&#xD;
slightly tinctured with tenderness.&#xD;
".How do you know that you are not&#xD;
what , thought you ?  You think I am&#xD;
ignorant of your past history-I knew&#xD;
it. all, before I sawyou; ayeyears ago."&#xD;
Myielda started, and loed up, with&#xD;
surprise but the glance, met sent&#xD;
her eyes quickly; away.&#xD;
A humorous' expression glowed in his&#xD;
large,-eoes, as he rose up. - Myrelda rose&#xD;
alto,his manner:indicated his inten-&#xD;
tion to depart. He. turned-folded his&#xD;
arms upn is breast,, and.stood directly,&#xD;
opposite, stepping gracefully back to a&#xD;
polite' distance, ie 'stood grave and&#xD;
Migriined.'&#xD;
"Iknow not how long. I shall remain&#xD;
in your city, Miss M9ntford; will you&#xD;
grent w ethe privilege and pleasure of&#xD;
visiting you during my stay ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
She signified her willingness to re-&#xD;
ceive him in a few words. His lofty&#xD;
bearing intimidated her, He stood si-&#xD;
lent some motnents, regarding her. at-&#xD;
tentively.&#xD;
"I know he was a monster, to forfeit&#xD;
onr love, Myrelda !".&#xD;
"Don't flatter me, Mr, Hamilton; it&#xD;
i unlike you."&#xD;
"Girl! you know I never flatter !" he&#xD;
said, grufly, "Had I known you were&#xD;
suoh a child in years, I wouldn't have&#xD;
condescended to correspond with you,&#xD;
by George ! I judged from your wri-&#xD;
ings, that you were much. older ; I&#xD;
thought to find you more womanly in&#xD;
appearance."&#xD;
" My age entitles me to that term, at&#xD;
least, Mr. Hamilton," she returned, half&#xD;
poutingly.        ,.&#xD;
"Your age !-good Lord !--how old&#xD;
were you when you first loved, Miss&#xD;
Montford, ten or twelve !" He drew*&#xD;
himself up, dignifiedly and looked in-&#xD;
credulous. Myrelda laughed at his af-&#xD;
fected air.&#xD;
- "As'far back as my recollection = ex-&#xD;
tends, Mr. Hamilton, which is some-&#xD;
where in the vicinity of my third year."&#xD;
"The deuce ! That .damned rascal,&#xD;
I mean !"&#xD;
" Herbert !"' Surprise and indigna-,&#xD;
tion drew forth this familiar name, in a&#xD;
tone of -severe reproof. Myrelda forgot&#xD;
she stood face to face withthe offender,&#xD;
in lieu of sending a barbed    arrow&#xD;
through the space of three hundred&#xD;
miles to chastise him for the vagrant&#xD;
crime of profanity. Her cheeks exim-&#xD;
soned and scorched beneath the mirth-&#xD;
ful expression which came over his fAce&#xD;
,as she looked up with a half-frown into&#xD;
ihis beaded eyes.&#xD;
" There, don't annihilate me with a&#xD;
a thunderbolt of wrath, Myrelda, as I&#xD;
am not yet prepared to 'shuffle off this&#xD;

that back,.if you please, and beg par-&#xD;
don for paining your little pure Metho-r&#xD;

the miscreant. How old were you when&#xD;
yoU loved hm, Myrelda ?".&#xD;
"I was seventeen, sir."&#xD;
" And how many years have elapsed&#xD;
since then ?" he asked, bluntly, you see&#xD;
mi object is a simple ,sum in addition,&#xD;
in order to satisfy my mind on one point&#xD;
where your appearance and assertion&#xD;
conflict."&#xD;
"Seven, Mr. Hamilton."&#xD;
" Heavens and earth-.you are not&#xD;
twenty-four ?-impossible ! Why you&#xD;
look like a child of fifteen, so frail and&#xD;
fairy--and your face is as inno----that is&#xD;
simple as an infant's ! Will you never&#xD;
grow old Miss Montford ?"&#xD;
"In heart; no sir, that is a bud of&#xD;
perennial youth. I have no patienceI&#xD;
with' people who grow older every year,h&#xD;
who count the mile posts of every an-&#xD;
nual revolution, as they roll on in the I&#xD;
stage coach of progression, over the&#xD;
highway of Time, towards the station- s&#xD;
house of Eternity. I don't believe in&#xD;
the theory, and never intend to practice n&#xD;
it. A miserable apology for a divine&#xD;
creion, I call it, who suffers the roll- f&#xD;
ing years to blow away the freshness and r&#xD;
verdure, the light and bloom, of theit I&#xD;
childhood; who marches straight .from n&#xD;
Arabia Felix to Arabia Petrea, and sits&#xD;
down ppon the sand of Arabia 'Desert, it&#xD;
sighing like furnace' for the green things e&#xD;
of the years they threw away in the m&#xD;
by-gone. I mean to stand still, like&#xD;
&#xD;
Joshua's moon, till the battle of life is&#xD;
ended."&#xD;
His usually stern lips were slightly&#xD;
parted, with a soul-full smile, as she&#xD;
glanced-naively up.&#xD;
"I believe you! You -have a heart&#xD;
that will never}count the years, nor feel&#xD;
the weight of Time. Why I thought&#xD;
myself at least twenty years your -se-&#xD;

"So did I sir, when we first met 't--&#xD;
she looked archly up-" you appear ten&#xD;
years younger, now."&#xD;
"Since I discarded' that superflu-&#xD;
ity ?  As it is, I am but tenyearsyour&#xD;

She colored at his expressive glance.&#xD;
" Do you like me, Myrelda ?" he ask-&#xD;
ed, suddenly and bluntly.&#xD;
Her face sobered in a moment.&#xD;
" Certainly, Mr. Hamilton !" she re.&#xD;
plied, indifferently. -&#xD;
S"That won't do, my lady, say yea&#xD;
or no, unequivocally,. Are ou satis-&#xD;

"1 Yes sir," she said sententiously.&#xD;
He stood silent some timed-Myrelda&#xD;
dared not look up. He extended his&#xD;
hand as if to say farewell. Bhe gave&#xD;
him hers, and he retained it.&#xD;
"You remember the vow in my last&#xD;

She drew back .with dignified e&#xD;

" I do, sir, and now say I cannot sub.&#xD;

her slight form softly, very softly, but&#xD;
closely to his breast. She trembled like&#xD;
a leaf in a summer wind, and her head&#xD;
drooped powerless upon his bosom. She&#xD;
heard, in the deep momentary hush,.the&#xD;
quicv pulsations of the. manly heart&#xD;
withintiat bosom. 'He turned her face&#xD;
gently, and pressed a soft lingering kiss&#xD;
upon 10r lips.&#xD;
"Myrelda !" , His voice was low and&#xD;
half tremulous;&#xD;
She opened her eyes, and they met&#xD;
his; they were fall of deep, yet mourn-&#xD;
ful tenderness; his: face was very pale,&#xD;
and the firm mouth strangely expres-&#xD;
sive of mental disquietude and anxiety.&#xD;
She' essayed to disengage herself from&#xD;
his embrace, but her feeble strength was&#xD;
inadequate to the effort-his strong arms&#xD;
held her softly, but securely, -to, his&#xD;
bosom.&#xD;
" Lovely girl, if the strength of this&#xD;
little form, qivering in my arms, were&#xD;

ly; caught her with a sudden impulse&#xD;
tightly: to 'his, breast, and. as quickly,&#xD;
but gently releasing her, turned silent-&#xD;
ly, .and -left the apartment.&#xD;
Myrelda sank down, half-fainting, up-&#xD;
Onthe sofa. % She was bewildered by the&#xD;
scene that had transpired. She would&#xD;
have laughed, incredulously, had some&#xD;
gipsey oracle foretold it a few hours pre-&#xD;
vious. She became indignant at her&#xD;
weakness.   He. had triumphed ! Her&#xD;
small mouth compressed tightly at the&#xD;
thought. He had performed the vow&#xD;
that excited her risibility, and defiant&#xD;
resolve,when her mirthful eyes first read&#xD;
th bold declaration-performed it with.&#xD;
out' power 1Qn her part-eto resist him&#xD;
She was confused and amazed, as she re&#xD;
trospeeted the past hour. He had ut&#xD;
tered no word of love, and yet had al&#xD;
the seeming of a lover ; and had; irre&#xD;
&#xD;
sistibly, assumedthe privilege of an ac-&#xD;
cepted suitor. She had never met his&#xD;
match before; he perplexed hertreason-&#xD;
ing faculties. One moment he sent to&#xD;
her cheek the indignant crimson; the&#xD;
next her heart palpitated wildly beneath&#xD;
his respectful, admiring eye. He was&#xD;
bold, yet courteous; arrogant, yet deli-&#xD;
cate and dignified.'- He could awe her&#xD;
into silence and diffidence by his grave&#xD;
and stately bearing, and win a smile at&#xD;
will ! If that were love, she had never&#xD;
comprehended its full import and power&#xD;
till now ; no one had ever .exerted such&#xD;
magical influence before; and as weeks&#xD;
went on, and Herbert Hamilton became&#xD;
a daily visitor at the Vale, Myrelda's&#xD;
heart was forced to the confession that&#xD;
he was the arbiter of her earthly happi-&#xD;
ness or misery.&#xD;
He presumed no more upon a lover's&#xD;
privilege, and appeared only in the char.&#xD;
acter of a friend. He was blunt at&#xD;
times, but his deportment was unexcep-&#xD;
tionabie, in gentility and refinement.&#xD;
He drew her out, without apparent de-&#xD;
sign, and led her wonderingly and en-&#xD;
thusiastically over the grand and glowing&#xD;
area of his. own rich, expansive mind.&#xD;
The lightness and sarcasm that had,&#xD;
characterized their epistolary acquain-&#xD;
tance, was superseded by an earnest,&#xD;
unaffected tone and manner. Occasion-&#xD;
ally, flashes of wit and, satire, would&#xD;
escape her smiling lips, at his expense,&#xD;
as a refuge for the timid shrinking of&#xD;

eloquent reproof, would instantly "ib-&#xD;
vert her Assumed levity. He could sub-&#xD;

to look, and long for his coming; and&#xD;
her heart-beats became mightily accceler-&#xD;
ated, at the well-known sound; and&#xD;
when, after three weeks constant com-&#xD;
munion, long, anxious days roller lag-&#xD;
gardly away, and he came not to the&#xD;
Vale, she experienced a thrill of pain-&#xD;
ful disappointment, that nqught in her,&#xD;
past unhappy history had ever equaled.&#xD;
She knew he was yet in her vicinity&#xD;
and, his inexplicable desertion rendered&#xD;
her heart-sick, and world-weary. "He&#xD;
had ceased to love her-and now that she&#xD;
bad learned to love him, with an intensity&#xD;
that was soul-absorbing, he indifferently&#xD;
withdrew from her society !"&#xD;
She wished she had never met him.&#xD;
Literature became distasteful; her pow-&#xD;
ers of coneentrativeness were dispersed;&#xD;
her ideas were too dissipated to be pro-&#xD;
lific of verse, and she wandered through&#xD;
the autumn-tinted Vale, aimless, and&#xD;
with but one thought: "he should never&#xD;
become conscious of his triumph!"&#xD;
11er eyes flashed, .spiritedly, even&#xD;
while her cheek paled with anguish-&#xD;
pride, and love struggled for the ascen-&#xD;
dency. She could recall nothing, in&#xD;
the past, that extenuated his conduct.&#xD;
She had thought he loved her. True, he&#xD;
had not expressed it in. words, but his&#xD;
dark, earnest eyes had often been silent&#xD;
orators of the soul, and more eloquent,&#xD;
even, than words.&#xD;
Perhaps he thought her too easily&#xD;
won ; she might have betrayed her&#xD;
feelings, despite her efforts to conceal&#xD;
them from him. Myrelda longed for.&#xD;
one more meeting, even while she feared&#xD;
it. Her proud soul yearned for an op-&#xD;
portunity to retrieve, by apparent apathy&#xD;
what she deemed she had lost, by in-&#xD;
advertence, in the' past. He should not&#xD;
triumph if cool indifference. in seem-&#xD;
ing, could deprive him of the vic-&#xD;
tory.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
.,Evy skulks behind, to squeeze the gal-bag in the&#xD;
cup of life."&#xD;
An elegant mansion on --street,&#xD;
was brilliantly illuminated, and the hour&#xD;
for the appearance of the guests had&#xD;
nearly arrived. Two girls-daughters&#xD;
of the master of the feast-perfect con-&#xD;
trasts in person, as well as mind, were&#xD;
giving the finishing touch to their toilet&#xD;
before mammoth mirrors, in an upper&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
Rooes of costly pearl-satin, draped&#xD;
their delicate forns, but the arrange-&#xD;
ment of the hair, and other little et&#xD;
ceteras of personal adornment, that be-&#xD;
tray, indubitably, the arcana of the&#xD;
soul, differed materially, according to&#xD;
the antipodal tastes of the individual&#xD;
two.&#xD;
Lora's, the eldest, fell in elaborate&#xD;
and heavy ringlets,.of raven hue, over&#xD;
a neck and shoulders of surprising nu-&#xD;
dity, that could not vie-with the lily in&#xD;
whiteness, at nature's own decree, and&#xD;
lay in midnight masses, upon cheeks&#xD;
that were wholly indebted to art, for&#xD;
there "celestial rosy red;" while a wreath&#xD;
of artificial flowers encircled her bru-&#xD;
nette brow.&#xD;
Mabel's fair tresses were put smoothly&#xD;
back from a full round forehead, white&#xD;
and pure as alabaster, and fell in light,&#xD;
silky, natural curls, behind her delicate&#xD;
ears, while a single snowy moss rosebud&#xD;
nestled amid the golden clusters,&#xD;
Lora's eyes flashed upon you, from&#xD;
beneath long, jetty' fringes, brilliant and&#xD;
black as the ringlets around them--Ma-&#xD;
bel's looked meekly, through the brown&#xD;
curved lashes, liquid and blue as a cloud-&#xD;
less June sky.&#xD;
"tHere ! clasp this bracelet, Bell;&#xD;

the catch is a little impaired."&#xD;
"Pish !" Lora pursed up her mouth&#xD;
contemptuously. "Savage, indeed ! you&#xD;
might bless your stars, Bell, if you were&#xD;
half as handsome ; temper or no temp-&#xD;
er !"  She glanced into the mirror, and&#xD;
smiled complacently.&#xD;
"I am content, Lora, and not dis-&#xD;
posed to grumble at nature for with-&#xD;
holding from me, superior charms."&#xD;
"You might as well be, since you&#xD;
don't possessthem! By the way, Bell,&#xD;
if you'd adorn yourself more, you'd&#xD;
find it a decided improvement. You&#xD;
put me out. of patience, with your odd&#xD;
notions. Those two stingy buds look&#xD;
rather sneaking, in my opinion. Here&#xD;
let me twist this wreath around your&#xD;
head, and give you more of a patrician&#xD;
air."&#xD;
"No, thank you; I prefer nature to&#xD;
art, and besides, I don't wish to rival&#xD;
you, since you are determined to win,&#xD;
which-Query :"&#xD;
"Fudge !" ejaculated Lora, forget-&#xD;
ting in her petulence, her claim to. ar-&#xD;
istt racy. "Did you ever know me to&#xD;
fail?"&#xD;
"Past success don't guarantee future&#xD;
triumph."'&#xD;
"He is only aman, Bell."&#xD;
"But an extraordinary one, if I am'&#xD;
any judge of physiognomy, Lora."&#xD;
"The very reason I intend to tri-&#xD;

"I doubt it, Lo.; he is not one to&#xD;
change easily,"&#xD;
"Change ! you don't suppose her ca-&#xD;
pable of enslaving him, Mabel Clyde ?"&#xD;
"I don't suppose anything else on&#xD;
the subject, sis."&#xD;
"Fiddle-dc-dee ! I'll bet my head he&#xD;

pearances.' Such a man as Herbert&#xD;
Hamilton, would never condescend to&#xD;
wed one situated as Myrelda Mont&#xD;
ford!''&#xD;
"It is only such as Mr. Hamilton,&#xD;
Lora, who think with 'the sweet swan&#xD;
of Avon,' that 'marriage is a matter of&#xD;
more worth than to be dealt in by at-&#xD;
torneyship.' It is only such sordid,&#xD;
ignoble minds as Fred Gerald, who&#xD;
make wealth a sine qua non, in their&#xD;
choice of a conjugal partner."&#xD;
"I don't want to hear any more of&#xD;
your nonsense, Mabel Clvde. It is no&#xD;
indication of a contracted soul. to wed&#xD;
one in our own sphere of life; and Mr.&#xD;
Hamilton will never stoop from his dig-&#xD;
nity and station, to mate with one so&#xD;
far beneath him, as Myrelda Montford!"&#xD;
"How ungenerous and unfeeling, to&#xD;
insinuate thus of one whose social posi-&#xD;
tion is equal to your own, despite her&#xD;
reduced circumstances, pecunarily.--&#xD;
Have you forgotten the divine precept,&#xD;
Lora; 'do justly, and love mercy ?"&#xD;
" Then do it yourself, and leave me&#xD;
to manage my own business, since 'every&#xD;
tub must stand on its own bottom.'&#xD;
Mr. Hamilton is deceived; I haven't a&#xD;
doubt of that-but I'll enlighten him,&#xD;
and that speedily !"  Her black eyes&#xD;
fulminated with - ominous significance.&#xD;
"1Her lackadaisical rhymings   have&#xD;
touched his fine sensibilities, and he&#xD;
fancies himself in love, perhaps. He&#xD;
has too high and proud a soul to wed&#xD;
one in such ill repute as Myrelda Mont-&#xD;

"Ill repute ! Lora!  Myrelda's rep-&#xD;

&#xD;
HERBERT HAMILTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
His noble mien and calm dignity,,im-&#xD;
pressed the beholder, at first glance,&#xD;
with a sense- of his proud ancestry, and&#xD;
native strength.&#xD;
His dark eyes glanced rapidly around&#xD;
the room, and rested with a thoughtful&#xD;
disappointed look upon the carpet.&#xD;
Lora exerted all her arts to lure him&#xD;
to her side, but without success; he sat&#xD;
calm and grave till the soft notes of&#xD;
the piano trembled beneath the touch&#xD;
of Mabel. He rose and moved quiet-&#xD;
ly towards the instrument, his counte-&#xD;
nance lighting-up with interest.&#xD;
Lora soon managed to happen in close&#xD;
proximity.&#xD;
.Mabel sang " Twilight Dews," and&#xD;
his dark eyes rested upon her sweet&#xD;
face, with a vacant, mournful expres-&#xD;
siod, as she proceeded. He bowed in&#xD;
graceful acknowledgement of the pleas-&#xD;
ure her performance had afforded him,&#xD;
as she rose from the instrument.&#xD;
Lora succeeded her, at his polite re-&#xD;
quest. Her jeweled fingers flashed over&#xD;
the, ivories, with a rapidity that was in-&#xD;
tended to startle her hearers into ad-&#xD;
miration and wonder at her superior&#xD;
powers of execution.&#xD;
Mr. Hamilton stood calm and gravel&#xD;
during the shrieking and groaning of'&#xD;
the belabored and tortured wires. He&#xD;
placed before her a simple song, as the,&#xD;
storm subsided, and her fingers lay pas-&#xD;
sive upon the echoing keys.&#xD;
I am glad to find this among your&#xD;
collection, Miss Clyde, as it is a par-&#xD;
ticular favorite, and one I have but re-&#xD;
cently become familiar with- -in fact,&#xD;
one I have heard but once, and that,&#xD;
by mere chance. Will you favor me?"&#xD;
She glanced at the title, and turned&#xD;
der brilliant eyes upon him, with a&#xD;
Beaming smile.&#xD;
Had Mr.Hamilton taken a peep inh&#xD;
1 her chamber'- an hour previous,&#xD;
id seen the ill4empered frown upon&#xD;
&#xD;
her brow, and heard the low vulgarism&#xD;
which escaped her passionate and scorn-&#xD;
ful lips, he could scarcely'have identi-&#xD;
fied her with the now smiling and soft-.&#xD;
voiced girl.&#xD;
" I regret that I cannot, Mr. Hamil-&#xD;
ton, as I practice only difficult operas,&#xD;
and this is too simple to claim my at-&#xD;
tention ; but as my sister's preference is&#xD;
for this style of composition perhaps&#xD;
she can gratify you."&#xD;
She turned her eyes again upon the&#xD;
music-page, and starting, slightly ejacu-&#xD;
lated.&#xD;
" Myrelda Montford !---I knew not&#xD;
that that song was anong my collection,&#xD;
before !" her lip curled with contempt.&#xD;
Mr. Hamilton regarded her a mo-&#xD;
ment, gravely, but piercingly, and turn-'&#xD;
ed away, with an undefinable expres-&#xD;
sion- on his firm face; when he returned&#xD;
he was accompanied by Mabel.&#xD;
" Your sister has induced me to hope&#xD;
that you can favor me with this son ,&#xD;
Miss Mabel " he said, with a -gentle-&#xD;
ness of tone that made her look up.&#xD;
" I can, sir, although it was quite new&#xD;
to me a few hours since ; 'but I admired&#xD;
it so much that I acquired it rapidly..&#xD;
There is a touching pathos in the&#xD;
words, in such perfect harmony with&#xD;
the air that it impresses me with the&#xD;
sadness that must have pervaded the&#xD;
heart of the author, and I sympathize&#xD;
with her sorrow through the medium of&#xD;
her song."&#xD;
Mabel's cheek became suffused with&#xD;
a soft, delicate tinge, as she looked up&#xD;
into his dark eyes, riveted so earnestly&#xD;
upon hers.&#xD;
" My own sentiments, precisely, Miss&#xD;
Mabel, I admire it for its pathos and&#xD;
sweet simplicity. I am no worshipper&#xD;
of modern compositions (which means,&#xD;
simply, an apology for everything ex-&#xD;
cruciating in music,) and believe that in&#xD;
music, as in poetry, the simpler the.&#xD;
&#xD;
style the greater the effect; and if yoi&#xD;
can give it the expression of the author&#xD;
from whom I first heard it, the effec&#xD;
will be complete."&#xD;
Mabel drew her hands quickly from&#xD;
the key-board, with a naivet of manner&#xD;
that became her vastly.&#xD;
"I beg you will exonerate me from&#xD;
the effort, then, Sir.  I shall surely fail&#xD;
Mr. Hamilton ! It was from her that I,&#xD;
too, first heard it, which rendered me&#xD;
sensible of my incapacity to do it full&#xD;
justice."&#xD;
His cheeks flushed fhintly, and he&#xD;
smiled brightly down on the upturned&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"I can trust you, fair lady; one who&#xD;
possesses a soul as appreciative as yours&#xD;
cannot fail of effect."&#xD;
Her modest face bent beneath his&#xD;
glance, with a rosier hue. She H'esita-&#xD;
ted a moment, instinctively; then, with&#xD;
a determined air, her small white hands&#xD;
swept over the keys. Her lute-like&#xD;
voice rose soft: and mournful, after a&#xD;
plaintive prelude, and the words flowed&#xD;
clear and distinct, above the suppressed&#xD;
accompaniment. Lora watched the ex-,&#xD;
pression of his countenance, as he stood&#xD;
beside Mabel, with folded arms. His&#xD;
eyes were bent upon the young face,&#xD;
with a softness and mournful earnest-&#xD;
ness that suggested the thought: " was&#xD;
it the songstress, or the author of the&#xD;
song, that inspired that subdued tender-&#xD;
ness of seeming,"&#xD;
She averted her face, to conceal the&#xD;
irrepressible shade of ill humor upon her&#xD;
brow, as he led Mabel from the piano,&#xD;
at the close of the song, without a glance&#xD;
at her self-sufficient ladyship.&#xD;
Possessing a spirit of perseverence&#xD;
worthy of a better causb, she succeeded&#xD;
in becoming his partner in conversation&#xD;
during the evening.  He addressed her&#xD;
with grave and dignified reserve. Not&#xD;
to be foiled in her mean purpose, she&#xD;
&#xD;
u gradually led the way to a discussion of&#xD;
, the merits of the writers of the day, and&#xD;
t carelessly drawing a neatly-bound vol-&#xD;
ume from the centre-table, she asked,&#xD;
indifferently :&#xD;
r    " In what estimation do you hold this&#xD;
authoras a poet and novelist, Mr. Ham-&#xD;
iltoa ?"&#xD;
He received the volume from her ex-&#xD;
tended hand, and turned -to the title-&#xD;
page.&#xD;
1  "'Myrelda Montford."  I have long&#xD;
admired her superior powers as a litera-&#xD;
teur, and thought Milton's innovation&#xD;
upon Murray's grammar applicable to&#xD;
her position in literary merit; ' than&#xD;
whom none higher sat,'" he returned,&#xD;
calmly.&#xD;
Lora bit her lip with vexation.&#xD;
" Miss Montford enjoys an exalted&#xD;
station among the literati, and is justly&#xD;
esteemed for her talents, and admired&#xD;
for her personal beauty, by your sex;&#xD;
but-" she stopped abruptly, and looked&#xD;
confused.&#xD;
"But what ?--if you please. Pray,&#xD;
proceed. But is avoided by your sex,&#xD;
I infer from your unfinished phrase."&#xD;
" I am not authorized to make that&#xD;
assertion, Sir, as I am not on terms of&#xD;
intimacy with her, nor associate with&#xD;
any who. are."&#xD;
" Are you personally acquainted with&#xD;
Miss Montford ?" He regarded her&#xD;
steadily, with an immovable counte-&#xD;
nance.&#xD;
"In childhood we were school-mates,&#xD;
but have had no intercourse for years.&#xD;
I meet her occasionally, in public, and&#xD;
truly pity her unfortunate fate; but it&#xD;
is not considered advisable to continue the&#xD;
acquaintance, under the circumstances.&#xD;
She lives very retired, I am informed,&#xD;

opinion of the world, Mr. Hamilton."&#xD;
She drooped her eyes sadly to the car-&#xD;
pet.&#xD;
"But one in your position need not&#xD;
apprehend- the frowns of the world,&#xD;
Miss Clyde, as that ever fawns upon&#xD;
wealth and station. The veriest rascal&#xD;
may screen' himself behind a golden&#xD;
post, and escape a richly-merited halt-&#xD;
er; and if you consider her worthy of&#xD;
your countenance and friendship, it&#xD;
would be a noble-act of moral heroism&#xD;
to extend to her tie support of your&#xD;
favor and influence, in order to effect&#xD;
her rescue from the shade of appro-]&#xD;
brium into which she has fallen."&#xD;
"No one, Mr. Hamilton, is beyond&#xD;
the reach of stigma, in any position, if&#xD;
they voluntarily lay themselves liable&#xD;
to incur it.'"'&#xD;
46Very true-your prudence is com-&#xD;
mendable. Is she, then, so reduced,&#xD;
in the estimation of society, as to ren-&#xD;
der such scrupulous care to avoid per-&#xD;
sonal contact, absolutely necessary ?"&#xD;
Lora sighed very softly.&#xD;
"Excuse me for not replying to that,&#xD;
sir, I have no disposition to reflect un-&#xD;
favorably, upon the reputation of any&#xD;
one, particularly one of my own sex,&#xD;
who is, perhaps, the innocent victim&#xD;
- of calumnny, owing to her peculiarly un-&#xD;
fortunate situation. I regret that she&#xD;
has been made the subject of discussion&#xD;
since it has led me, insensibly, into the&#xD;
error of seeming disparaging insinua-&#xD;
tions. I frankly confess I have spoken&#xD;
inadvertently, and imprudently, and&#xD;
beg you will consider what has been&#xD;
said, an involuntary repetition of mere&#xD;
rumor."&#xD;
"Pray, do me the favor to state upon&#xD;
what rumor bases its deteriorating&#xD;
whispers."&#xD;
"Upon the fact of her lover's deser.&#xD;
tion, whom you may see yonder; and&#xD;
&#xD;
who denies the imputation of change&#xD;
bleness, occasioned by her reverse&#xD;
fortune, as some have been charitable&#xD;
enough to affirm, in her defence, and&#xD;
to his detriment.''.&#xD;
Mr. Hamilton turned his large, deep&#xD;
eyes, upon the tall and strikingly hand-&#xD;
some individual designated, and a fierce&#xD;
light gleamed from their midnight&#xD;
depths. Lora's jealousy subverted. hr&#xD;
prudence, as she observed the expres-&#xD;
tion of infinite scorn upon his com-&#xD;
pressed lips, as his glance rested, linger-&#xD;
ingly, upon the false-hearted and con-&#xD;
temptible imitation of manhood before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"She has one of the sweetest and,&#xD;
most innocent faces imaginable, as you&#xD;
will coefess at first sight."  Lora&#xD;
affected ignorance of their personal ac-&#xD;
quaiitance, from motives politic. "But&#xD;
I have heard her compared to--"&#xD;
she ceased again, right suddenly, and&#xD;
bit her lip, with seeming vexation.&#xD;
"To what? pray proceed.&#xD;
"I declare, positively, I11 not utter&#xD;

"You have caused me, unconsciously to&#xD;

her with ia second attachment. I am&#xD;
constrained to believe,&#xD;
"-Man may not hope her heart to win,&#xD;
Be his of common mould."&#xD;
Mr. Berrien watched narrowly, with-&#xD;
out apparent design, the appearance of&#xD;
Hamilton's countenance during this re-&#xD;
mark ; but the expression was sugges-&#xD;
tive of no heart-history-the smile lin-&#xD;
gered abeut his firm mouth, and his&#xD;
dark eyes rested quietly, and with the&#xD;
utmosr unconcern, upon the wall oppo-&#xD;
site.&#xD;
It was not without design that he&#xD;
entered on this discussion; but at the&#xD;
close of their conversation Mr. Berrien&#xD;
was puzzled for a conclusion.&#xD;
CAPTERVII.&#xD;
"To dream of joy and wake to morrow,~&#xD;
Is doomed to all who love, or live."-BaoN,&#xD;
It was a dreamy-Indian summer day.&#xD;
Myrelda sat under the old willow, by&#xD;
the spring, looking off at the dark river&#xD;
waters rolling silently onward to the&#xD;
great ocean reservoir. Her small hand&#xD;
held a pencil upon an open page, but'&#xD;
few  characters were traced upon the&#xD;
shiny sheet.   She looked down and&#xD;
rested her pale, forehead upon ,the ta-&#xD;
per point of her slender fingers, acd&#xD;
sat long and motionless,,&#xD;
"I cannot,-thought is vagrant,"-&#xD;
she rose slowly and sadly from the wil-&#xD;
low-roots as she uttered this self-ad-&#xD;
dress, laid the sheet in her portfolio and&#xD;
turned towards the cottage.&#xD;
Aunt Linder, the cook, met her in&#xD;
the garden walk, she looked up under&#xD;
her cap border end eyed her earnestly.&#xD;
"ILor bless yer heart, honey, you&#xD;

Myrelda smiled with affected cheer-&#xD;
fulness, at the affectionate old creature's&#xD;
solicitude.&#xD;
" I am well, aunty, only a little tired;&#xD;
I am going right out now and obey in-&#xD;
structions."&#xD;
" She can't fool me, po thing !"-&#xD;
muttered the old woman, as she looked&#xD;
anxiously after the tripping form of&#xD;
her young mistress. "It's dat Ham-&#xD;

The old woman heaved a deep, groan-&#xD;

indignantly, as the object of her solici-.&#xD;
tude passed from the cottage yard gate,&#xD;
thinly veiled and mantled, and stepped&#xD;

ofgngled mirth and amazement, invol-&#xD;

He stood, in stately dignity regarding&#xD;
her attentively, with a strange compres-&#xD;
ion of the stern lips, around which&#xD;
glimered the faintest ghost of a smile.&#xD;
She turned quickly to conceal the&#xD;
treacherous blood that came rushing up&#xD;
beneath his glance, as Doctor, and Mrs.&#xD;
Gerald entered, followed closely by Mr.&#xD;
Berrien, whose presence was not prompt-&#xD;
ed by a desire to patronize the proprie-&#xD;
tor, of the -establishment, but merely to&#xD;
become anobserver of two within, whose.&#xD;
entree he had witnessed from a distant&#xD;
station&#xD;
Myrelda's ear soon apprizedher by&#xD;

request attracted her.&#xD;
" ertaihiy, Sir, if it is desirable, and&#xD;

Mr. Berrien responded in a loud and&#xD;
joulrari tone .-turning to the group.&#xD;
' aow all men by these presents,&#xD;

A merry laugh from all parties fol-&#xD;
lowed the finale. Myrelda, from child-&#xD;
hood, had loved and esteemed the warm,&#xD;
generous, and noble-hearted speaker.&#xD;
She would have accosted him sooner,&#xD;
but from an aversion to meeting others&#xD;
around her, and affected ignorance of&#xD;
his presence. She now turned impul-&#xD;
sively at his humorous, announcement,&#xD;
and -met his smiling eye fixed intently&#xD;
upon her. In a tone of pleasantry char-&#xD;
acteristic of the man, he approached and&#xD;
addressed her:&#xD;
"My dear young lady, it has been&#xD;
most truthfully asserted that 'where&#xD;
there 's a will there 's a way.' Now, I&#xD;
was positively determined to win a little&#xD;

plished the end in view. Without that&#xD;
method I'll venture the assertion you&#xD;
would have been deaf, blind and dumb,&#xD;
so far as the proximity of your most&#xD;
obedient was concerned."&#xD;
Myrelda took her cue from the ex-&#xD;
pression of his countenance.&#xD;
" No one can long remain uncon-&#xD;
scious of Mr. Berrien's presence whose&#xD;
auricles are not impervious to the 'voice&#xD;
of seven thunders'"-her face was scru-&#xD;
pulously sober.&#xD;
Mr. Berrien's eyes- twinkled with&#xD;
amusement at her affected air and cool&#xD;
satire. He turned to Mr. Hamilton,&#xD;
whose face betrayed an effort to sup-&#xD;
press his humorous emotions.&#xD;
" Just hear that !..--I never touch&#xD;

his declaration, and quailed before her&#xD;

and sauntered towards his occupied wife&#xD;

Myrelda glanced instinctively at Ham-&#xD;

neath the downcast lids. An icy cold-&#xD;

Hamilton rose very suddenly, and sat&#xD;
down beside her, with a stern compres-&#xD;

mental disquiet&#xD;

he silently pressed, and softly released,&#xD;

Though greatly indebted to Mr. Ber-&#xD;

Arlingford, yet Herbert Hamilton's own&#xD;
metal ability and oratorical powers, as&#xD;
displayed on political occasions, during&#xD;
the Presidential campaign of 184-, in&#xD;

He obtained an introduction, through&#xD;
Hr. Berrien, and learning Hamilton's&#xD;
intention to establish himself- in town&#xD;
for a time, placed in -his hands papers&#xD;
pertaining to a contested estate, thatre-&#xD;
quired days of incessant labor and legal&#xD;
cunning to comprehend. Hamilton's&#xD;
reputation hung upon this, his frst case,&#xD;
in a strange land, and with character.&#xD;
istic energy, and indefatigable zeal, he&#xD;
labored to acquit himself ,honorably.&#xD;
But despite his strong will, his thoughts&#xD;
would wander from the soiled pages be-&#xD;
fore him to the quiet Vale. "Where&#xD;
was Myrelda ? Did she watch and wait&#xD;
for his coming, and grow sad at his de-&#xD;
lay ?" He smiled at the thought of test-&#xD;
ing her feelings by his absence, and&#xD;
learning the extent of his influence by&#xD;
her appearance at their next meeting;&#xD;
yet at the close of that interview Ham-&#xD;

Myrelda's cheeks were'flushed to a&#xD;
charming hue, by the surreptitious&#xD;
glances she detected, ever and anon,&#xD;

joe was the butt of the whole town,&#xD;
but so good-natured that he never re-&#xD;
sented an imposition, save by appointed&#xD;
remark that sepithe crowd in a roar, and&#xD;
restored universal. harmony. He was a&#xD;
privileged personage, and went "scot&#xD;

or what was equivalent, "wormed" suf-&#xD;
ficient out of the captain or conductor&#xD;
to pay his fare. He never had a physi-&#xD;

designated:such drugs as the physician&#xD;
hod prescribed, but "s'posed he'd have&#xD;
to endure it, 'cause he hadn't got any&#xD;

"without money, and without price."&#xD;

ripe for fun, at the 'fool's' expense, sud-&#xD;

making tracks from his vicinity.&#xD;

"That shows yer brains, and yer&#xD;

fully picked up his well-worn chapeau,&#xD;
and eyed it narrowly, to inform himself&#xD;
of the injury it had sustained from such&#xD;
ungentlemanly treatment.&#xD;
His eye fell upon Myrelda, and her&#xD;
gallant, as he brought the insulted hat&#xD;
with a nervous jerk, upon his tangled&#xD;
tow-head. Now Joe was aiwardent admi-&#xD;

upon doing her the favorknasked,of fur-&#xD;

far-famed pump, whenever they chanced&#xD;
to meet there, during her evening walks&#xD;
which was not unfrequent, receiving&#xD;
in return for his gallantry, a copper&#xD;
coin, which was quite as large, in Joe's&#xD;
big blue eyes, as a Spanish dollar in a&#xD;

Joe clenched his hand indignantly,-&#xD;
as he observed Hamilton, and -felt a&#xD;
twinge of the green-eyed monster tug-&#xD;

very prominent forehead; his usually&#xD;

Mvrelda was silent, as she walked&#xD;
homeward with Hamilton, and her hand&#xD;
trembled with emotion as he drew it.&#xD;
within his arm.  He looked down upon&#xD;
'her face, as it became distinctly visible&#xD;
in the clear, cold moonlight. It was&#xD;
richly flushed, but very grave, and the&#xD;
speaking eyes were veiled behind the&#xD;
dark, drooping fringe. She raised them&#xD;
to his, intelligently, as a second burst&#xD;
of applause went up from the crowd, in&#xD;
the distance. lHe smiled as he met the&#xD;
glance.&#xD;
"All are eloquent in my praise but&#xD;
you, Myrelda."&#xD;
"Aid none feel more sensibly your&#xD;

soberly forward, with apparent insensi- from the orient sea, and he released her&#xD;

-mediate declaration of the love she&#xD;
fancied'shi b heldin those dark,-smil-&#xD;

chilled by his manner.&#xD;
The city clock told the hour oftwelve&#xD;
before lanilton left the - Vale; and&#xD;
yet no'word of affection had passed his&#xD;
lips, and Myreldai was no nearer the&#xD;
secret of his design than when they&#xD;
first .met. . Weeks rolled away, and&#xD;
matters had not ",pproximated a crisis,&#xD;
Hamilton had trhianphod in the suit in-&#xD;
stituted by Mr. Edwards, and all ton-&#xD;
gues "rang the changes" upon his name&#xD;
as a lawyer of unsurpassed legal ,bili-&#xD;
ty and ,superior- eloquence.&#xD;
Ambitious others, who had marri-&#xD;
ageable daughters, gave entertainments&#xD;
fbr his benefit; he was courted and&#xD;
iateedrei to a degree that would haVe&#xD;
inflated an ordinary man with self-bon-&#xD;
eit, to an explosive point. But Her-&#xD;
bert Hamilton received the adulation&#xD;
offered him  with a cool dignity and&#xD;
grave polithss that gave rise to fre-&#xD;
1equit speculationsupon the nature of&#xD;
his mental cbnforimation. He was the&#xD;
cotistaritattendant 'of Myrelda, when-&#xD;
ever she appeared innpublic; and a cer-&#xD;
*aih "old maid" oracle of the town, had&#xD;
even positively specified the day of their&#xD;
nuaptiels, to the inconceivable chagrin&#xD;
of man   a fair aspirant for his favor,&#xD;
--among which host Lora Clyde stood&#xD;
pre-eminent---and the unparalleled ex-&#xD;
citement of Dr. Gerald.&#xD;
Gerald paced this oike with the hv-&#xD;
rieaded monster-of 1EVENR Eguard-&#xD;
ingl the door of the 'jfernal regions"&#xD;
of hia inner nature. ;His handsome&#xD;
face was livid with- passion, and the&#xD;
fge qyes so soft, liquid, and "beauti-&#xD;
fqlly blue" in smiles, sapped fierce fire&#xD;
leneeh the black arching brows.&#xD;
«,' ;do it l'{lhe mnttered between,&#xD;

proud to decline and be branded a cow-&#xD;
ard. There is no alternative but death&#xD;
for ohe or both! I'll do it, by-   !"&#xD;
He dreg his chair to the glowing&#xD;
grate, and sat down to perfect his plans.&#xD;
Myrelda was the only woman that&#xD;
Gerald ever really loved, and the possi-&#xD;
bility of seeing her the wife of another&#xD;
maddened him. He now realized what&#xD;
must have been her anguish at behold-&#xD;
ing him united to a rival; for Gerald&#xD;
had never doubted her love-it was im-&#xD;
possible from the very nature of sur-&#xD;
rounding circumstances.&#xD;
He had "married for money,"' a pee-&#xD;
vish, consumptive looking girl, who, he&#xD;
fancied, and fondly' hoped, would not&#xD;
long be a barrier to the realization of&#xD;
his dreams of yet wedding Myrelda;&#xD;
but who, contrary to his expectations,&#xD;
had lived on and on, the pest of his&#xD;
life, with her captious and jealous na-&#xD;
ture, until Gerald; had he possessed&#xD;
tire nerve, would have dragged her cup&#xD;
in desperation, and thus rid himself of&#xD;
the incubus.&#xD;
-He was a dastardly villian, who would&#xD;
have perpetrated any deed of darkness&#xD;
but for. the dread of detection. He&#xD;
was absolutely vain and unprincipled&#xD;
enough to believe he could so affect the&#xD;
mind of Myrelda, by an eclairissement&#xD;
respecting the events and motives of the&#xD;
past, as to win her forgiveness and be&#xD;
reinstated upon the throne o.f her heart !&#xD;
He would not have hesitated to lay his&#xD;
fortune at her feet, and take her to his&#xD;
arms penniless now ; but Gerald was&#xD;
too indolent, and had too little self-reli-&#xD;
ance to, wed her, a poor man, and be-,&#xD;
thrown upon his own resources for fu-&#xD;
ture independence, He had reflected&#xD;
on her character to subserve a dupli-&#xD;
cate purpose, but he reconciled it with&#xD;
an elastic conscience, by promising to&#xD;
make ample reparation for the wrong,&#xD;
&#xD;
after the removal of the one obstacle t&#xD;
his happiness, whose sudden demis&#xD;
coupled with subsequent transaction&#xD;
might subject hinm to 'suspicion, a&#xD;
perhaps provoke a post-mortem invest&#xD;
nation. Mrs. Gerald was indebted fo&#xD;
her daily powers of respiration to th&#xD;
villhins pusillanimity next to the grea&#xD;
Arbiter of human destiny.&#xD;
But noi, Gerald was growing reek&#xD;
less and doubly desperate. In spite o&#xD;
his unceasing efforts to poison his min(&#xD;
by innuendoes. Hamilton persisted it&#xD;
his attentions to Myrelda, resisting th&#xD;
manifest desires of others equally gift&#xD;
ed in personal attractions, and far su&#xD;
perior in pecuniary circumstances, t(&#xD;
capture him; and would complete th&#xD;
drama by uniting her to himself, by an&#xD;
indisoluble bond.&#xD;
. Gerald resolved, in his own mind&#xD;
that that compact should never be seal&#xD;
ed, while he lived to witness it! Had&#xD;
he possessed the power of ubiquity, he&#xD;
would have frowned less fiercely, and&#xD;
planned less deadly, in the solitude of&#xD;
his vindictive and invidious soul, but&#xD;
laughed with fiendish exhultation to be-&#xD;
hold the gulf that had opened up with-&#xD;
out his agency, between the two he so&#xD;
yearned to divide forever !&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
"And truest friends, through error, wound our rest."&#xD;
-YOUNG.&#xD;
It was a keen, frosty night in De-&#xD;
cember, unusually cold for so southern&#xD;
a latitude. Hamilton, as was his wont,&#xD;
lad passed' the evening at the Vale.&#xD;
His pannerwas so softened, and insinu-&#xD;
ating, that Myrelda had confidently ex-&#xD;
pected, with a palpitating heart, a crisis&#xD;
before his departure, and was painfully&#xD;
disappointed when he rose to retire,&#xD;
without meeting her anticipations&#xD;

r    Myreldia observed it, though so trans-&#xD;
e sient; and an indefinable fear fell, like&#xD;
t a snowflake upon the warm bed of her&#xD;
heart, where such rosy nymphs of love&#xD;
and hope had so recently nestled. She&#xD;
f half shrank from the hand extended&#xD;
d for the good-night pressure, a d quiv-&#xD;
n ered slightly, with a vague apprehen-&#xD;
e sion hitherto unknown in the presence&#xD;
of Herbert Hamilton.   She tried to&#xD;
- rally before the enquiring glance he&#xD;
o cast down upon her,' and forced a smile&#xD;
e to her lips; but it was not a heart-sinile,&#xD;
Hamilton saw that. -He Fel her hand&#xD;
tightly, td increase her agitation'by ren-&#xD;
dering her fully sensible of his con-&#xD;
sciousness, and the same peculiar smile&#xD;
I flitted over his features.&#xD;
"You are not well, MyreldaI" He&#xD;
spoke soberly and tenderly.&#xD;
" Perfectly, thank you; I am con-&#xD;
scious of no indisposition."&#xD;
"But your hand is trembling, and&#xD;
your face is strangely pale" a xaiehit&#xD;
since you had cheeks like  uti roses.&#xD;
What is the matter, Myrelda?" .R&#xD;
passed his arm around her waist softly,&#xD;
but his flashing eyes, and'the fi steri.&#xD;
ous smile upon his lips, evidenced little&#xD;

left her with  firm resolute step. My-&#xD;

She went deliberately anid caluy and&#xD;
turned the bolt, and 'returned as col-&#xD;
lectcdly. She remenbered sitting'dowd&#xD;
upon a low ottoman, and leaning hei-n&#xD;
head against the 'sfa-cashions with"&#xD;
strange sensation'of fullness in the re-&#xD;
aion of the brain, but nothing more.&#xD;
When she awoke to coimousness, an&#xD;
icy coldness pervaded her slender fame.&#xD;
The lights burned grim  and ghostly,&#xD;
but the fire had gone out in the grate,&#xD;
She consulted her watch-it was past&#xD;
3 o'clock  Harnilton had left .her at&#xD;
eleven.&#xD;
She turned off the gas'and ascended&#xD;
to her chamber. The night-taper threwv&#xD;
its sickly rays over the apartmetit as&#xD;
she entered. 'She took her little bile&#xD;

True to her promise, Aunt Lind&#xD;
had watched Hamilton "like a chick'&#xD;
eyein' salt," and no change of Myre&#xD;
da's countenance had escaped her vig&#xD;
lant eye; but for sometime past he&#xD;
anxiety had been relieved by the smoot&#xD;
aspect of circumstances.  Now   sh&#xD;
glowed with indignation, as the poo&#xD;
girl entered the breakfast-room, after&#xD;
night of such mental conflict. It tol&#xD;
unmistakably, upon her pale face, an&#xD;
in her languid eyes ; though she mad&#xD;
indisposition an apology for her appear&#xD;

led as easily as Myrelda's aged and in&#xD;

" Consarn 'im !" mumbled the ol&#xD;
woman over her morning's avocations&#xD;
" I knowed it! I seed it all in 'ih&#xD;

She gave orders to Rose, and wateo&#xD;
ed every ring of the door-bell, taking&#xD;
care to answer it in person. She con-'&#xD;
strained Myrelda to take an anodyne,&#xD;
and she was slumbering from the effects&#xD;

r Tell her I wish to see her, if only for&#xD;
h a momeirt.&#xD;
e   "She's sleep,n," returned the old&#xD;
)r lady, in the same pie-crust tone.&#xD;
a    Hamilton drew out a card, and pen.&#xD;
d killing a few lines thereon, gave it to&#xD;
d the old woman, with instructions to&#xD;
e hand it to Myrelda, immediately upon&#xD;
awaking, and left the cottage slowly,&#xD;
- and with a dejected air.&#xD;
-   "I wonders w'at 'e rit on dis thing,"&#xD;

She threw it in the stove, without&#xD;
a single twinge of conscience !&#xD;
The ignorant old creature thought&#xD;
she was doing her darling young mis-&#xD;

At the usual hour, Hamilton again&#xD;
appeared, and was met by the watchful&#xD;
old woman.&#xD;
" How is your mistress now, mother?"&#xD;
he asked, smilingly.&#xD;
"Better, Sir, but she don' want to see&#xD;

"You gave her my card ?"&#xD;
"In course, Sir.&#xD;

I wished ter de Lord,'e'd go way, an'&#xD;
never could git back !"&#xD;
The day waned slowly and wearily to&#xD;
Myrelda. In spite of herself she had&#xD;
hoped and listened for his . coming.&#xD;
Surely he could not leave her thus.,&#xD;
His sound .judgment, upon reflection,&#xD;
must commend her. She could not be-&#xD;
lieve 'him  unworthy; she reproached&#xD;
herself for the spirit she had manifested&#xD;
the evening previous. Had she been&#xD;
more gentle, they might have parted in&#xD;
amity. Herbert Hamilton rose up be-&#xD;
fore ,her in the fullest proportions of&#xD;
manly excellence; he stood a perfect&#xD;
embodiment of nobility  and  virtue;&#xD;
love veiled all his imperfections, and&#xD;
even his inconsistencies dwindled into&#xD;
mole-hills that her injustice had magni-&#xD;
fied into mountains.&#xD;
But the red sun went down behind-&#xD;
the purple pile in the west, and day af-&#xD;
ter day rolled leadenly away, and yet he&#xD;
came not. Her physical frame declined&#xD;
through'sympathy with the mind, and&#xD;
disease locked up with the key of de-&#xD;
lirium the store-house of the sufferer's&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
Regardless of wringing and breaking a heart&#xD;
Aireadyto sorrow resigned.-CowPER-.&#xD;
Myrelda slowly convalesced and went&#xD;
very pale, but apparently cheerful about&#xD;
her daily duties. She had ceased to&#xD;
lok for Hamilton'svisits' and his name&#xD;
never passed her: lips, save to her- in-,&#xD;
firm father's inquiry concerning his ab-&#xD;
sece. She simply replied that their&#xD;
&#xD;
intercourse wasended; and Col. Mont-&#xD;
ford imagining that Hamilton had shared&#xD;
the fate of her former lovers, made no&#xD;
further allusions to him. He was well&#xD;
satisfied with her rejection of his suit,&#xD;
as he fancied, - Myrelda was theidol of&#xD;
his heart, and the only remaining tie&#xD;
that bound him to earth; for Charles,&#xD;
bis noble, high-souled boy -of six-and-&#xD;
twenty summers, he had long mourne4&#xD;
as dead. Twelve months had gone by,&#xD;
and brought no tidings of the wander-&#xD;
er; but Myrelda, whose organ of Hope was&#xD;
more fully developed, had not so soon&#xD;
despaired. She endeavered to induce&#xD;
her aged parent to indulge brighter&#xD;
anticipations respecting the disclosures&#xD;
of the future.&#xD;
Three weeks had passed, and still she&#xD;
had not seen Hamilton; and Myrelda&#xD;
sat dreaming of all the by-gone con-&#xD;
nected with him, when a timid tap at&#xD;
the sitting-room door aroused her. A&#xD;
little, pale beggar boy entered at her&#xD;
bidding, large tears standing in his meek&#xD;
blue eyes, as he lifted them mournfully-&#xD;
to hers. Myrelda drew the little fel-&#xD;
low close upro the 'grate, and warmed&#xD;
his tiny bare feet, that were red and&#xD;
pinched with cold. He was no stranger&#xD;
to the charitable girl, and had come on&#xD;
an errand that wrung his-childish heart&#xD;
to perform. His mother was dying, and&#xD;
desired to see her benefactress before&#xD;
her weary heart was still forever. .,&#xD;
Myrelda hastily donned her mantle&#xD;
and furs, and obeyed the sad summons.&#xD;
was the first time since her rupture&#xD;
with Hamilton, that - she had left the&#xD;
cottage, and her heart gave an acceler-&#xD;
ated throb, as she thought of the possi-&#xD;
bility of meeting him. But Hamilton.&#xD;
was invisible; and she reached  the&#xD;
widow's poor dwelling without receiv-&#xD;
'ing an -electric, shock from those search-&#xD;
ing black eyes.&#xD;
'-Mrs.:Fairfield's desire was to commit&#xD;
&#xD;
I . .,-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, TR E B3A8 BLTU.&#xD;
&#xD;
to Myrelda's benevolent care, her little&#xD;
orphan child, when she was no longer&#xD;
permitted to care for him. She had&#xD;
wedded in opposition to her stern father's&#xD;
imperative command, who had obstin-&#xD;
ately persisted in refusing to pardon the&#xD;
filial disobedience, but who would, she&#xD;
cherished the hope, receive his little&#xD;
grand-son, when the grave had softened&#xD;
the sin of his mother. She humbly,&#xD;
besought Myrelda's -intercession in be-&#xD;
half of the helpless one. Her' father&#xD;
was an aristocratic citizen 'of Raleigh,&#xD;
North Carolina, and she implored her&#xD;
influence, through the medium of an epis-&#xD;
tolary communication.&#xD;
Myrelda relieved the poor woman's&#xD;
solicitude, by promising to exert her-&#xD;
self, to the utmost in the boy's behalf,&#xD;
and give him- a home at the Vale, until&#xD;
the relenting father should claim his&#xD;
little grand-child.&#xD;
A step arrested her attention; she&#xD;
turned and met the smiling blue eyes of&#xD;
Dr. Gerald ! She bowed haughtily, to&#xD;
to his graceful salutation.&#xD;
"I was not aware that Dr. Gerald&#xD;
was your physician," she said, turning&#xD;
to the widow with flashing eyes.'&#xD;
'Neither is he, Miss Montford ; Dr.&#xD;
Merton is the-'good Samaritan' of the&#xD;
poor.                          -&#xD;
-Myrelda cast upon him a glance of&#xD;
ineflable'scorn,and repeating her promise&#xD;
to 'the suffering woman, she turned&#xD;
proudly, and left his presence.&#xD;
This was what Gerald expected and&#xD;
desired. He had seen her pass with&#xD;
the poor boy, and divined her destina-&#xD;
tion. Half an hour subsequent, he ob-&#xD;
served' Hamilton tending in the same&#xD;
direction,  A  swift thought flashed&#xD;
through the miscreant's mind.   He&#xD;
would try one experiment before resort-&#xD;
ing to lead or steel.- He went hastily&#xD;
through a parallel street, and watched&#xD;
for Hamilton's approach, and perceiving&#xD;
&#xD;
48&#xD;
&#xD;
him in the distance, he calculated with&#xD;
all a villain's accuracy; and when My-&#xD;
relda left the humble abode she observed&#xD;
Hamilton directly opposite.&#xD;
The uniiexpected apparition unstrung&#xD;
every nerve in her system, and,,to add to&#xD;
her confusion, Dr. Gerald n -w issued&#xD;
from the same dwelling, and went rap-&#xD;
idly in an opposite direction !&#xD;
Myrelda's bloo4seemed to freeze in&#xD;
her veins, as she saw the deep eye of&#xD;
him, whose esteem was dearer to her&#xD;
than life itself, turned sternly towards&#xD;
her. What thoughts might arise from&#xD;
such a coincidence ?. She was in a state&#xD;
of utter despondency when she entered&#xD;
her chamber, and threw herself, in wild&#xD;
abandonment, upon the bed.&#xD;
She could not comprehend how Ger-&#xD;
ald had planned so perfectly, yet she&#xD;
could not attribute it all to chance.&#xD;
She saw his object was to render her&#xD;
despicable in the estimation of Hamil-&#xD;
ton, and he had, in all probability, suc-&#xD;
ceeded., They were sundered now, and&#xD;
no explanation could be given him, even&#xD;
if an explanation would prove satisfac-&#xD;
tory - under such suspicious circum-&#xD;
stances. Perhaps Hamilton's incom-&#xD;
prehensible conduct was wholly attri-&#xD;
butable to Gerald's machinations; and&#xD;
now the'incident was well calculated to&#xD;
become "confirmation strong" of any&#xD;
deteriorating whispers that had reached&#xD;
the ear of even the most generous and&#xD;
lenient.&#xD;
Myrelda quivered convulsively through&#xD;
her entire frame, and to compose her&#xD;
nerves and forget her misery, she eager-&#xD;
ly swallowed down a copious soporific,&#xD;
and was under its lethean influence,&#xD;
when Herbert Hamilton, for the third&#xD;
time since the eventful night of their&#xD;
painful parting, rang for'admission at&#xD;
the cottage.&#xD;
"Ain't in "-said Aunt Lindr, as&#xD;
she faced him at the door.&#xD;

old woman.&#xD;
" Go and see, if you please "-he&#xD;
strode into the parlor to await her re-&#xD;

grumbled Aunt Linder as she stumbled&#xD;
-up stairs--" dare ain't no gittin shet of&#xD;

old lady had an idea that that State&#xD;
was just a little the other side of crea-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
" Aint come Sir,'' said the sullen ne-&#xD;
gress, as she returned to the parlor with-&#xD;
out even peeping into Myrelda's room.&#xD;
She knew she was there, but thought&#xD;
to save her conscience by not seeing&#xD;
her! Aunt Linder was a professing&#xD;
christian of the Methodist denomina-&#xD;
tion, who could sing and shout at a re-&#xD;
vival,,and turn up her eyes .as~devout-&#xD;
ly as the colored clergyman himself;&#xD;
but like a great many more of her race,&#xD;
and some who can even boast of an An-&#xD;
glo-Saxon skin she never "stuck at tri-&#xD;
fles," when she flattered herself the end&#xD;
would justify the means.&#xD;
She loved Myrelda and hated Ham-&#xD;
ilton for the unhappiness she saw he&#xD;
had occasioned her, and was, she de-&#xD;
clared, "bent on gettin shet of 'im."&#xD;
Hamilton turned, without a word,&#xD;
and left the Vale, and the cottage door-&#xD;
ball never again vibrated to his touch.&#xD;
The following day Aunt Linder was&#xD;
employed in the yard as a little boy pass-&#xD;
ed through the gate with a letter for&#xD;
" Miss Myrelda."&#xD;
"Who sont it, honey ?"querried the&#xD;
old woman, as she eyed the delicate&#xD;
missive.S&#xD;

"Never mine it, honey; Miss My's&#xD;

it from the boys hand.&#xD;
" I shan't get any more quarters-&#xD;

give me heaps iny .bits ter run erran's&#xD;

"What fu6, chile ?" Aunt Linder's&#xD;

"Bless de Lord !" ejaculated the old&#xD;
woman, as she hurried to the kitchen,&#xD;
and framed the letter into the red hot&#xD;
stove-" dare, take dat ! I shan't be&#xD;

But Myrelda's health did not im-&#xD;
prove, with the knowledge of Hamil-&#xD;

But to see those dear eyes, that had&#xD;
never looked upon her but with love&#xD;

under the white shroud and the, coffin-&#xD;

an hour previous, and he slumbered&#xD;
quietly, without a symptom of pain.&#xD;
His appearance encouraged her to hope&#xD;
for a favorable result. , Little Edward&#xD;
Fairfield, the helpless orphan who had&#xD;
not yet been claimed by his purse-proud&#xD;
grand-father, lay upon a low couch in&#xD;
the corner close by ; and Rose was coiled&#xD;
upon the warm hearth, running through&#xD;
the land of dreams, with a song in her&#xD;
olfactories, that required careful nurs-&#xD;
ing to keep its occasional trumpet blasts&#xD;
from disturbing the sufferer.I&#xD;
She was weary and faint, and Aunt&#xD;
Linder had promised to call her when&#xD;
her father awoke. She relieved the old&#xD;
woman's anxiety by obeying her com-&#xD;
mand. She went up to her chamber,&#xD;
and lay down without disrobing. Weari-&#xD;
ness ere long shut her senses to all re-&#xD;
membrance and realization -of mortal&#xD;
suffering and endurance.&#xD;
The shout, as of a thousand voices,&#xD;
awoke her. She sprang up, mechani-&#xD;
cally, and stood -a moment in .complete&#xD;
bewilderment; then, realizing her poci-&#xD;
tion, she rushed to the window. A&#xD;
dense mass was collected below, and the&#xD;
deep boom. of the alarmabell, breaking&#xD;
through the clatter of flying feet, and&#xD;
clash of rolling engines, was a sufficient,&#xD;
explanation. A second shout from the&#xD;
crowd, swelled above the confused roar,&#xD;
as the night taper displayed her forin&#xD;
through the parted curtain-drapery.&#xD;
Myrelda had left her :chamber door&#xD;
open, to hear, more distinctly every&#xD;
sound from her father's room below, as&#xD;
it came up the stair-way, but the blus-&#xD;
tering wind had drawn it to,'and caught&#xD;
the slender bolt.&#xD;
Myrelda darted towards it;and dashed&#xD;
into the adjoining chamber, but a ,vol-&#xD;
ume of smoke and flames surged upthe&#xD;
stairs, and drove her, half blinded, back.&#xD;
There was one more hope of eseqpe,&#xD;
&#xD;
and she bounded to the door opening into&#xD;
the upper hall, whence, she might de-&#xD;
scend to the passage below; but a&#xD;
tongue of liquid fire, streaming through&#xD;
a rear window, met her half-way the&#xD;
ball, and she retreated. before it, clos-&#xD;
ing the door securely, to arrest the pro-&#xD;
gress- of the raging elements.&#xD;
She was now effectually walled in,&#xD;
and no prospect of -escape was before&#xD;
her. The cottage was constructed of&#xD;
brick, with a rear addition of wood,&#xD;
and roofed with combustible material.&#xD;
Every outlet was barred up with fire,&#xD;
and soon .the ligneous portions of her&#xD;
prison, must yield to the fury of the&#xD;
flames. She abandoned all hope of life,&#xD;
and committing her spirit to Him who&#xD;
gave, folded her arms upon her breast,&#xD;
and looked down upon the babel below&#xD;
with a strange calmness upon her death-&#xD;
ly white face.&#xD;
It was now one o'clock. Let us go&#xD;
back two hours, to the time of Myrelda's&#xD;
departure from the bedside of her slum-&#xD;
bering father.&#xD;
Aunt Linder ensconsed herself in&#xD;
the cushioned rocker, and listened&#xD;
to the weeping and wailing of the&#xD;
wind, till a sensation of drowsiness&#xD;
crept over her, and threatened to hang&#xD;
weights upon her dusky eyelids. She&#xD;
rubbed her eyes and pinched her arms&#xD;
to repel the assaults of Morpheus, but&#xD;
without avail. All was hushed and&#xD;
solemn within. The lamp glimmered&#xD;
pale and pensive, over the calm face of-&#xD;
the patient, and soon she was under&#xD;
the narcotic influence of her-surround-&#xD;
ings; Her 'head fell back upon the&#xD;
cushion-her mouth opened gradually,&#xD;
to a surprising capaciousness, and Aunt&#xD;
Linler slept soundly.     -&#xD;
A hissing and scorching started her&#xD;
to - her feet. Flames of fire were&#xD;
streaming through the door, communi-&#xD;
eating with the kitchen, and rushing&#xD;
&#xD;
up the stairs, impelled by the draught.&#xD;
Aunt'Linder's -foot came in swift&#xD;
.contact with Rosa's head, who started&#xD;
and screamed at the lurid scene. - Lit-&#xD;
tle Edward was awakened by the noise,&#xD;
and rushed for the side door. Aunt-&#xD;
hinder caught her master in her strong&#xD;
arms, and rolling*him up tightly in the&#xD;
quilt, followed upon the children's heels.&#xD;
She now looked about for Myrelda, and&#xD;
wrung her hands in an agohy of terror,&#xD;
when she thought of her perilous posi-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The old woman plunged for-the door&#xD;
again, but the flames forced her back,&#xD;
The sitting-room Was a sea of liquid&#xD;
fire. She sprang to the rear door of&#xD;
the hall, but it was locked.' Her pow-&#xD;
erful arms nerved with excitement and&#xD;
solicitude, would have defied the iron&#xD;
security, but for the scorching flares&#xD;
that shot around the angle, in the bil-&#xD;
lowy blasts, and beat her froth her post.&#xD;
She fled to the front door, and with two&#xD;
tremendous jars, dashed it from its fast-&#xD;
enings. The crowd followed her into&#xD;
the hall, but none ventured to cross the&#xD;
gulf of fire, that R surged through the&#xD;
window above, hissing'and snapping in&#xD;
its fury, but the faithful old domestic;&#xD;
She was plunging recklessly forward,&#xD;
when her arm was caught in the vice-&#xD;
like grasp of a stout man.&#xD;

Aunt tinder struggled for freedom,'.&#xD;
but he held her fast, and pulled her into&#xD;
the wintry air.&#xD;
She looked up at Myrelda's window,&#xD;

and evidently resigned to her fate, she&#xD;
threw up her arms wjdly, towards her,&#xD;
crying despairingly : "oh; honey ! po'&#xD;

stained expresionsof surprise and gl4-&#xD;

A smile, gentle but sickly, flitted over&#xD;
Hamilton's face, as he responded to his&#xD;
friends' manifestations of pleasure; but&#xD;
soon it faded out, leaving him pale and&#xD;
stern, as before.&#xD;
e' " How now, Dr. ?" inquired the host,&#xD;
as pr. Merton entered and stared in as-&#xD;
tonishment at Hamilton, whose presence&#xD;
he at lengthacknowledged by a cold,&#xD;
supereillious nod. Not a muscle of&#xD;
jian ilton's face moved as he returned&#xD;
it, with one as freeing.&#xD;
"Bad," the Dr. shook his head om-&#xD;
inously.-"He can't last much longer-&#xD;
that's evident. I&#xD;
"Poor child .1 said the host, glauc-&#xD;

said Mr. Berrien ardently, "Fate may&#xD;

is one that can ,never be removed-&#xD;
faith in the Eternal."&#xD;
A low, mocking laugh issued from&#xD;
Gerald's lips at the close of this remark,&#xD;
and was succeeded by a sober seeming.&#xD;
and half-frown, as though he were&#xD;
self-censured for the involuntary act.&#xD;
All eyes, but Hamilton's, were turned&#xD;
towards him in a monient; but Gerald&#xD;
fixed his own, pertinaciously, upon the&#xD;
grate.'&#xD;

ed Augustus Smith, a dissolute com-&#xD;
panion of Gerald, whose reputation for&#xD;
debauchery and libertinism was far ahd&#xD;

Gerald turned slowly and silently,&#xD;
and shut one eye slyly at the speaker,&#xD;
with a quietness of movement that&#xD;
seemed to say, he designed the answer&#xD;
to be observed by the inquirer alone,&#xD;
but which was really culculated to at.,&#xD;
tract the notice of all around, by its si-"&#xD;
lent significance.&#xD;
Mr. Berrien glanced at Hamilton;&#xD;
his face was bent over the paper before&#xD;
him, and be. was apparently unaffected&#xD;
by the various remarks. Gerald, too,&#xD;
had marked his calm, unconscious air,&#xD;
and felt encouraged by his apparentin-&#xD;
difference. He had feared that Hamil-&#xD;
ton had returned to renew his suit to&#xD;
-Myrelda, and resorted to his method to&#xD;
"sound" his feelings. He became buiy-&#xD;
ant at the result, and grew more bold&#xD;
in his iusinuations, without rendering&#xD;
himself amenable to the law for slander.&#xD;

the wind, as it wailed and howled&#xD;
around him.&#xD;
A pale light was shining from My-,&#xD;
relda's chamber window, and he stood&#xD;
a moment in silent, thought, with old-&#xD;
time memories clustering about his heart,&#xD;
and the white wings of the angel of&#xD;
repentance poised above him.&#xD;
Howoften, in happy days gone by,&#xD;
had he. stood thus, beneath the old trees&#xD;
of her childhood's home, and breathed&#xD;
his love to her, on the soft, sweet mel-&#xD;

The flames would speedily bar up that&#xD;

the construction of the cottage. In boy-&#xD;

for the purpose, and applied a match to&#xD;
the rear of the building. The wild winds&#xD;
would sweep the flames through the&#xD;
apperture, and ignite the combustible&#xD;
parts ere the sleepers awoke, or the&#xD;
alarm sounded.&#xD;
Gerald mingled with the startled citi-&#xD;

.from a thousand lungs, over the con-&#xD;
fused city ; and none dreamed that the&#xD;
author of the wild conflagration stood&#xD;

thought of her injustice, and the' fear&#xD;
that he was too proud to seek a recon-&#xD;
ciliation.&#xD;
But now the wild storm that tossed&#xD;
her life-sea had lulled, and her little&#xD;
barque safely reached the haven, through&#xD;
hisfirmness and love, who was dearer to&#xD;
her than the life he had preserved, and&#xD;
whom she deemed lost to her irretriev-&#xD;
ably.&#xD;
" It is a blessed thought that I owe&#xD;
my life to ,you, Herbert!"&#xD;
Hamilton shuddered, as he pressed&#xD;
her closer in his arms.&#xD;
"'My God ! if I had not returned !"-&#xD;
his blood curdled at the thought of her&#xD;
horrible death, but for his firma.essand&#xD;
defiant spirit, for Myrelda coulthnot&#xD;
have escaped, even with the means with-&#xD;
in her reach, with the flames swelling&#xD;
over it, without his strength and shield.&#xD;
,He did not know that but for his re-&#xD;
turn, she would then be slumbering in&#xD;
her quiet, unmolested home.&#xD;
He bent his cheek, caressingly, to&#xD;
her forehead.&#xD;
" It is written, 'He shall give His&#xD;
angels charge over thee'-that is, such&#xD;
as you, Myrelda. Thank God! you are&#xD;
all-mine, now, darling!"&#xD;
- " Heart and life !--you can never&#xD;
know how dearly I love you, Herbert !"&#xD;
Hamilton thought he could "guess"&#xD;
pretty creditably to his Yankee reputa-&#xD;
tion, when he looked down in her tell-&#xD;
&#xD;
tale eyes, and felt her modest face hiding&#xD;
its blushes on his bosom.&#xD;
But sorew was not yet ended, with&#xD;
Myrelda, arid the event that gave her to&#xD;
the arms of Hamilton, as an affianced&#xD;
wife, deprived her of another love.&#xD;
Excitement and exposure to the win-&#xD;
try winds, hastened the closing scene of&#xD;
Col. Montford's life; and ere the morn-&#xD;
ing dawned upon the smouldering ruins&#xD;
of her once lovely and peacefulhome,.&#xD;
the vital spark had been caught up'&#xD;
from the aged clay-tenement, to mingle&#xD;
with the full blaze of eternity; and the.&#xD;
white drapery of death was drawn over&#xD;
the mortal habitation ! He died with&#xD;
Hamilton's and Myrelda's hands folded&#xD;
together in his. -&#xD;
"God bless you, my children, an&#xD;
make, and keep you worthy of Himself.&#xD;
Herbert, take a father's blessing, and&#xD;
his best earthly gift-his helpless and&#xD;
innocent child.. Her lot has been a&#xD;
hard one-soften her future with your&#xD;
love, and you will have your reward,&#xD;
'both in the life that now is and, and&#xD;
that which is to come.' I can die quiet-&#xD;
ly now, knowing that my darling has a&#xD;
home in stronger arms than her feeble&#xD;
old father's. And you, my daughter,&#xD;
let the consciousness of duty, faithfullyI&#xD;
performed, ameliorate your sorrow forE&#xD;
my loss. Don't grieve for me, my child,&#xD;
'it is appointed unto man once to die,'&#xD;
and the winds blow cold around this old&#xD;
tabernacle; but He will build it up in3&#xD;
new strength and glory, in that world&#xD;
where we may meet again. God bless&#xD;
you both as one, my children ; meet me&#xD;
there."                             t&#xD;
He pointed his pale, thin finger to- a&#xD;
wards heaven feebly, and with a gentle "&#xD;
pressure of their united hands, and a d&#xD;
soft sigh, the old soldier of the Cross b&#xD;
slept peacefully, the 'sleep that knows -&#xD;
no waking," till the "last trump shall&#xD;
sound."                             C&#xD;
&#xD;
Hamilton bore Myrelda half fainting&#xD;
from the chamber of death, and his&#xD;
strong soul deliquesced in tears, that&#xD;
brimmed his dark eyes, but -were re-&#xD;
strained ,from overflowing by the inner&#xD;
mandate': "thus far shalt thou go, and&#xD;
no farther !" at sight of her great grief.&#xD;
He laid her languid head upon his&#xD;
breast,and soothed her softly and ten-&#xD;
erly, as 'a young mother fondles her&#xD;
first born.&#xD;
"Oh, lordy, honey I" sobbed Aunt&#xD;
Linder, as she knelt at their feet, and&#xD;
mingled her tears with the pale orphan's.&#xD;
'-Don' cry, chileI he's better off now,&#xD;
honey.. De Lord's ways is oilers right,&#xD;
chile, an' we musn't blame 'iar fur 'flic-&#xD;

by'n bye1 IDon' ery, chile, you ain' all&#xD;
'lone in de worl', honey-bless de Lord!''&#xD;
Myrelda clung to Hamilton convul-&#xD;
sively, at this allusion, and nestled, her&#xD;
tearful face closer to his protecting&#xD;
bosom.&#xD;
"God is merciful! He has not left&#xD;
me comfortless ! Oh ! how desolate I&#xD;
should be without you, Herbert !"&#xD;
His arms contracted with impulsive&#xD;
force, around her tiny waist, at this evi-&#xD;
dence of utterdependence upon him for&#xD;
earthly hope and happiness. He clasped&#xD;
the little hand that lay upon his should-&#xD;
er, and kissed it with tender reverence.&#xD;
" My life is your defence-my heart&#xD;
your home. Lean all your helplessness&#xD;
on me, darling, and give all your care to,&#xD;
my arms,"&#xD;
"Oh, lordy ! mars Ham'lton,' cried&#xD;

ciated fork: child-like, in ts .slender&#xD;
proportions,.lying so trustingly- and&#xD;
grief-lades in his arms, and the thought&#xD;
that he had occasioned the unhappiness&#xD;
that conduced to her..soul touching&#xD;

have astonished the years that had roll-&#xD;

"Good God !, my poor darling!"&#xD;
"Oh ! mars Hubbert, say'you furgive&#xD;

wringing her hknds frantically, at the&#xD;

Hamilton lifted his head-calmly; his&#xD;
strong will had mastered his momentary&#xD;
weakness.&#xD;
"I do, from my heart, in considera-&#xD;

This affectionate outbreak increased&#xD;
Myrelda's tearm, and hiding her face in&#xD;
Hamilton's bosom, she laid one hand on&#xD;
her nurse's shoulder, sobbing: "'.Oh,&#xD;
aunty !"&#xD;
. He kindly and gently motioned the&#xD;
old woman away, and quieted the sor-&#xD;
rowing orphans with his irresistible tones&#xD;
of tender endearment. She. dried her&#xD;
eyes and lookediup.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of all this,&#xD;
Hurbert?"&#xD;
" At another time, you shall know ally&#xD;

have both been deceived, and kept apart,&#xD;
by that deception. You are weary now,&#xD;
little trembler; lay your head on my&#xD;
bosom again, and try to sleep. I can't&#xD;
suffer you to leave me yet, darling."&#xD;
" Only tell .me, Herbert, that you&#xD;
loved me without distrust!'-she was&#xD;
thinking of her visit to Mrs. Fairfield.&#xD;
"Before we met, I loved you, Myrel-&#xD;
da; and since our first meeting, that&#xD;
love has grown to spirit-worshipwithout&#xD;
a shadow of-distrust to cloud its bright-&#xD;

She laid her head upon his breast,&#xD;
with a tearful smile, and with his hand&#xD;
softly smoothing   her golden-brown&#xD;
tresses, .she fell asleep. -&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII..&#xD;
I had not lived till now, couldsorrow ki.-Bmtox.&#xD;
The old year died, and was buried in&#xD;
the great tomb of departed Time, with,&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE BAS BLEU.-&#xD;
&#xD;
a thin snow-shroud folded around his&#xD;
aged form; and the young anointed&#xD;
king came in at the midnight hour, and&#xD;
ascended the throne of his old sire,.to&#xD;
wield the sceptre of days, over his late&#xD;
inheritance.&#xD;
The beautiful city of Arlingford lay&#xD;
luiet and calm, in the cloudless morn-&#xD;
ing sun, deserted by the majority of its&#xD;
inhabitants, for its sister city, the great&#xD;
centre of gravitation, on each successive&#xD;
New Year's Dad.&#xD;
Hamilton and Myrelda sat alone, at&#xD;
Mr. Berrien's, where it was decided she&#xD;
should remain until her marriage, at her&#xD;
friend's urgent request, which was to be&#xD;
consummated as early as practicable,&#xD;
under existing circumstances.&#xD;
Myrelda would have deferred it till&#xD;
the period of her mourning was ended,&#xD;
but for her lovers desire to take her un-&#xD;
der his immediate protection and guar-&#xD;
dianship; her heart, too, pleaded in behalf&#xD;
,of a speedy blending of hearts and lives,&#xD;
by the solemn marriage ritual, and her&#xD;
lonely position justified it. She was&#xD;
now recovering from an illness of some&#xD;
days' duration, superinduced by the re-&#xD;
cent trying vicissitudes through which&#xD;
she had passed ; and delicately lovely&#xD;
she looked, reclining upon Hamilton's&#xD;
supporting bosom.&#xD;
Her mourning garb heightened the*&#xD;
pure transparency of her young, thin&#xD;
face, and small, waxen hands; and the&#xD;
red anthracite flushed a soft, faint tint,&#xD;
like the inner lining of the sea-shell,&#xD;
upon her cheek. Hamilton's lips, too,&#xD;
had done something towards making&#xD;
that modest face "blossom as the rose.&#xD;
He looked down upon her a moment&#xD;
in silence, and asked in a serious, half-&#xD;
incredulous tone:&#xD;
" How could you ever love that mer-&#xD;
cenary villai, Myrelda ?"&#xD;
"Idon'tiknow,lHerbert; I have often&#xD;
wondereld that I could have been so&#xD;
&#xD;
egregiously deceived--that I could ever&#xD;
have thought him all that was noble&#xD;
and love-worthy in man ! I W9k back&#xD;
with astonishment and shuddering, to&#xD;
the time when I stood upon the!brink&#xD;
of. the precipice; almost upon the eve&#xD;
of uniting my destiny with his; and&#xD;
thank heaven for the dark reverse of&#xD;
fortune that withheld me from that&#xD;
abyss of misery. Death itself, would be&#xD;
preferable to a life-union with so heart-&#xD;
less and perfidious a nature as Frederick&#xD;
Gerald's !&#xD;
"And yet you suffered for one so&#xD;
mean and despicable. I have never&#xD;
heard it from your lips, or read it in&#xD;
your private letters; but it breathea in&#xD;
your published 'articles. No one can&#xD;
linger there, and not feel that the author.&#xD;
has passed through 'the valley of the&#xD;
shadow of death !' And yet you could&#xD;
smile and go proudly and firmly for-&#xD;
ward, a 'hero in the strife,' when your&#xD;
heart was breaking ! I knew it all,&#xD;
though unknown to you, and pitied and&#xD;
revered, before I ever loved you, My-&#xD;
relda,"&#xD;
"Not for him, Herbert; not forphis&#xD;
desertion, did I suffer, but from the&#xD;
dying out of a first love. My fancy&#xD;
made him all that was true and worthy&#xD;
-he was my ideal of manly excellence -&#xD;
and when my idol fell, it crushed an&#xD;
mangled the spirit-vines twisted so con-&#xD;
fidingly and closely around him; but I&#xD;
never grieved for 1dm. Frederice Ger-&#xD;
ald possessed no power over my heart,&#xD;
when the certain of duplicity was looped&#xD;
back from his perfidious soul, and the&#xD;
nest of vipers stirred up by the rod of&#xD;
adversity.&#xD;
"what he was, my fancy made his;&#xD;

and not what he is, but what I fancied&#xD;
him, made my unhappiness. I cas&#xD;

upturned face; with a soul-full softness&#xD;
in' his dark eyes that told of reverence,&#xD;
yet, a shade of' disqiet swept over: his&#xD;
firm face.&#xD;
"The furnace of-affliction has refined&#xD;
the gold of your nature, Myrelda ; you&#xD;
are too good and pure for earth, much&#xD;
less for a life.ompanionship with me;&#xD;
and I marvel now, asI have ever done,&#xD;
how I could have woni you. You smile&#xD;
incredulously, and raise your eyes, re-&#xD;
proachfully; for this disparaging insinu-&#xD;

"No, Sir, but as near perfection as&#xD;

feel confident that glorious result will&#xD;
yet, be effected, because it is written,&#xD;
'put thy trust iii the Lord, and He&#xD;
shall give thee the desire of thy heart.'&#xD;
There would be no luke-warmness-no&#xD;
retrogression with you, Herbert ;'°you&#xD;
would never 'look back,' when your,&#xD;
hand was once 'put to the plow;' and&#xD;
daring all things for the right, you&#xD;
uld if necessary, die a martyr at the&#xD;

that desirable end; for He only knows&#xD;
the silent,- irresistible influence you&#xD;
have exerted upon my entire nature,&#xD;
from the first hour I ever knew you-~==&#xD;
years before we met.! All you fancy I&#xD;
would be; under such circumstances,&#xD;
Myrelda, I think you are; and I would&#xD;
as soon try, with a hope'of success, to&#xD;
overturn Gibralter, by mere physical&#xD;
force, as to attempt to shake your faith&#xD;
in Him, or render you less pure than&#xD;
now. There ! you are smiling and'blush-&#xD;

" I care for no other, Herbert. ''&#xD;
"if I could bring you as skinless a&#xD;

should long ago have called you my&#xD;
wife. You look up in wonder and half&#xD;
fear! Turn your face this way again,&#xD;
Myrelda; raise your eyes to mine, and&#xD;
tell me plainly, do you fear me ?" -&#xD;
"No, Sir; 'perfect love casteth out&#xD;
fear."&#xD;
" God bless you for that, my sweet&#xD;
girl ! I would believe your simple word&#xD;
more firmly than others affidavit! I trust&#xD;
you implicitly, and your moral superi-&#xD;
ority renders the revelation I have to&#xD;
make, a painful, even fearful task !"&#xD;
"'Don't tell me, then, Herbert; I can&#xD;
trust you for all the past, and the years&#xD;
that may await us in the veiled future.&#xD;
We all find something to deplore, when&#xD;
we look back, in later hours, to the days&#xD;
of childhood and youth, and you cannot&#xD;
have sinned more than others.&#xD;
"Let the dead past bury its dta-&#xD;

" My dear girl, your confidence qnd&#xD;

faith and love, and now that I have&#xD;
succeeded, they burden me with a fear&#xD;
for a revulsion of feeling !--and yet, let&#xD;
the consequences b.e what they may, I&#xD;
will not deceive you.' I never meant to&#xD;
do that, Myrelda; yet I wished to make&#xD;
your heart plead in my behalf, ere I&#xD;
drew aside the drapery of the past, and&#xD;
revealed to you the whole life of him&#xD;
whose destiny now you are willing to&#xD;
share. When I pledge to you at God's&#xD;
altar, a husband's love and protection,&#xD;
I shall not give you a heart with one&#xD;
niche reserved for the errors and wrongs&#xD;
of my early life, that I dare not suffer&#xD;
you to behold. I shall throw open&#xD;
every chamber of that heart, and show'&#xD;
you the home I offer you; and if you&#xD;
will 'then enter in and dwell there,'&#xD;
your husband's life will be devoted to&#xD;
your happiness.'&#xD;
" I will have no other home ,Her-&#xD;

"God grant it, Myrelda! Were you&#xD;
more of earth, I should fear you less!&#xD;
Lay your head on my bosom again, and&#xD;
let me see your face-so; it mirrors&#xD;
your soul as clearly as a limpid lake&#xD;

heart at every word !" His face was&#xD;
marble white and his broad brow con-&#xD;
tracted with inward emotion,.&#xD;
"You tremble, you grow pale, do you&#xD;
anticipate the revelation, Myrelda?'&#xD;
Go on, Sir; your looks unnerve&#xD;

not have sinned so grievously." She&#xD;
closed her eyes to shut out his expres-&#xD;

"I was born amid affluence, and rear-&#xD;

brother and sister, who have long lain&#xD;

and brother, all died and left me to buf-&#xD;

attained my twentieth year. My father&#xD;
was reduced from wealth to poverty by&#xD;
becoming surety for a faithless. friend,&#xD;
who absconded and left him to liquidate&#xD;
the debt,andthusrendered him penniless.&#xD;
Though but a child of eight years, I&#xD;
remember it as though it were but yes-&#xD;

my gentle meek-eyed mother; and I&#xD;
swore -in my youthful heart, vengeance&#xD;
upon him who occasioned them. She&#xD;
was my idol, and .my heart turned to&#xD;
stone. When a boy of twelve years, I&#xD;
knelt beside her humble coffin and wept&#xD;
tears of blood upon her cold, care-worn&#xD;
face. My father died three years pre-&#xD;

tone in which this probable result was&#xD;
uttered.'&#xD;
"You' tremble-you twine your little&#xD;
arms around m, as though they, with&#xD;
all their frailty, could avert that fate.&#xD;
Would you save me from it, Myrelda ?"&#xD;
"I would, Sir, with my life.'&#xD;
"Without your love, dear girl, your&#xD;
influence would be lost. I might take&#xD;
you to my arms, a wife, and love you.&#xD;
as fondly as now through long years;&#xD;
but without the knowledge that I held&#xD;
your- heart in my keeping, your life&#xD;
would not avail. , I shall never love&#xD;
you less than now, Myrelda; you may&#xD;
refuse to unite your destiny with mine,&#xD;
and cast me off as unworthy, but while&#xD;
there is a throb of life in my veins, or&#xD;
strength in this arm, you will have my&#xD;
love and protection. . Your father com-&#xD;
mitted you to my care-alas ! he knew.&#xD;
not whom he was trusting;--and long&#xD;
as life lasts I will perform a brother's&#xD;
part, if I may not claim a dearer, a more&#xD;
sacred title. But the ice.-rust that has&#xD;
been my;prison from boyhood, will not&#xD;
break and drop from my soul, without&#xD;
the warm  sunlight , of your love and&#xD;
faith. I know my own hardness and&#xD;
constitutional defects, and have tiied to&#xD;
correct them; but it is not in my nature&#xD;
to be pliant and impressible. I love you&#xD;
more intensely for being shut up from&#xD;
all the earth, forthe fibres of -my heart&#xD;
have but one support. You can nevev&#xD;
tear them fromyou, though you refuse&#xD;
to train them to loftier heights and sym-&#xD;
&#xD;
metrical proportions; you may go one,&#xD;
way, I the other}; the dividing will only-&#xD;
lengthen not loosenthe vines;'but the&#xD;
sea-waves of life that wash between us,&#xD;
will make the heart ache and bleed by&#xD;
the harsh chafings; and yet, the world,&#xD;
and you, would never know the inner&#xD;
anguish that I should endure, for I am&#xD;
so constituted, Myrelda, that I'd be torn&#xD;
and mangled limb from trunk, and joint&#xD;
from joint, before a tear should moisten&#xD;
my eye, or a sigh heave my bosom, be-&#xD;
cause of the sad reverses of human life,&#xD;
or the 'ills that flesh is heir to.' Inever&#xD;
could yield to that weakness, though&#xD;
doomed to torture more terrible than the&#xD;
lost spirits' in perdition undergo. Had&#xD;
my poor dear mother been spared me, I&#xD;
should have been a better man; her love&#xD;
would have kept my soul from petrify-&#xD;
ing in the cold, subterranean waters of&#xD;
exclusion and revenge. It was in your&#xD;
power, girl, to accomplish what she&#xD;
would have effected; for you are the&#xD;
first one that has drawn a tear from my'&#xD;
eyes since I knelt beside her coffin,-&#xD;
twenty-two years ago ! Love for and&#xD;
from you, was the golden key to the&#xD;
prison-house of my incarcerated better-&#xD;
being. It is sympathy, soul-companion-&#xD;
ship that I need and seek ; that alone,&#xD;
can soften"and* melt my iron nature to&#xD;
purer and holier thoughts and feelings.&#xD;
Can you give me that, Myrelda, know-&#xD;
ing to whom you trust it ?"'&#xD;
" I can, Herbert; 'with all thy faults&#xD;
I love thee still.' Had not your wrong'&#xD;
brought its own punishment=-and were&#xD;
you impenitent ,now, I should fear to&#xD;
trust you.. Your voluntary confession&#xD;
betrays 'your noble soul; and while I,&#xD;
shudder at the enormity of your sin,&#xD;
I love you more for what you have suf-'&#xD;
fered.i God pardons the penitent, and&#xD;
commands us to forgive. You can nev-&#xD;
er be less dear to my heart, Herbert, till i&#xD;
you cease to be what you now are."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And now that you know all, will&#xD;
you renew your vow; and promise, be-&#xD;
fore high Heaven, to be niine through&#xD;
all Time and Eternit ?"&#xD;
" I will,I do, Herbert !"&#xD;
Herbert Hamilton drew the lips that&#xD;
uttered the vow to his own, and her&#xD;
cheek was moist - with 'the overflowing&#xD;
tenderness and joy that welled up froma&#xD;
the great deep of his strong heart, and&#xD;
brimmed his dark eyes when he hid&#xD;
her face in his bosom, and bowed"his&#xD;
head upon her brown tresses.&#xD;
"G od bless you, dear one, and make&#xD;
me worthy of you! I know my unwor-&#xD;
thiness to live 'in a heart where-God&#xD;
dwells;'I feel the honor and blessing of&#xD;
possessing such a heart; and one less&#xD;
pure I would not wish to claim. With&#xD;
all my guilt and sinfulness, I have ever&#xD;
shunned the sinful and abhorred crime.&#xD;
Could I forget that deed, Myrelda, I&#xD;
should look back upon the past with as&#xD;
little remorse as most men experience&#xD;
from retrospection. My dear mother&#xD;
seemed ever near me, directing my ways&#xD;
and keeping me from the evil that is in&#xD;
the world. Strange, that I did not xe-&#xD;
pent before breaking a heart as pure,&#xD;
but not as firm and self-reliant as yours."&#xD;
".Did you feel no compunctions of&#xD;
conscience, Sir ?-was there no inward&#xD;
monitor whispering you to desist ?'&#xD;
" Myrelda, I felt no remorse till my&#xD;
enemy was in his grave; my enmity ex-&#xD;
tended not beyond that. I recovered&#xD;
my father's wealth, and reduced my&#xD;
poor mother's murderer to the state in&#xD;
which she died, and I was avenged;&#xD;
but far less content than when I was&#xD;
a poor 'charity-boy.'&#xD;
S"With the announcement of his&#xD;
death, the first billow of remorse rolled&#xD;
over my granite heart, and my dead&#xD;
mother's mild eyes-so like to yours,&#xD;
Myrelda, both in color and expression--..&#xD;

as warm and tender sensibilities as she&#xD;
whom I destroyed. I had never seen&#xD;
hin, when we met upon the field of&#xD;

Had I not formed my resolution previ-&#xD;

for, Myrelda, he was the exact counter-&#xD;

from mortal anguish, in delirium. A&#xD;
brain fever gave promise of a final re-&#xD;
lease from earthly ills; but, as if by a&#xD;
miracle, I recove ed. Myrelda, I open-&#xD;

regret that they had not closed forever!&#xD;
Don't reprove me with that look for&#xD;
my madness; I am fully sensible of it&#xD;

"I sent for him, Myrelda, during&#xD;

of my inner life to induce him to accept&#xD;
what I proposed to offer. He entered&#xD;
my chamber with a heart burning hot&#xD;

me, girl. Your soul-touching effusions&#xD;
first arrested me. I saw that you had&#xD;
suffered deeply, and was drawn towards&#xD;
you by that belief; and yet, in those&#xD;
plaintive transcripts of the heart, you&#xD;
rose superior to earth, and led me away&#xD;
where there was rest for the weary soul&#xD;
at last. I remember saying aloud, im-&#xD;
pulsively, while reading one of your ar-&#xD;
ticles: 'an angel could hardly utter a&#xD;
worthier sentiment.' I conceived an&#xD;
irresistible desire to know you better,&#xD;
and I resolved to. address you by let-&#xD;

"Your reply startled me; it was so un-&#xD;
like your published writings. It was wit-&#xD;

and referred to a copy of mine for a&#xD;
solution of the riddle. and there I found&#xD;
it. "1You had 'hit me off' on every&#xD;

you continually, and to speculate upon&#xD;
your personal appearance.   I had two&#xD;

I was determined to see you at all haz-&#xD;

have prevented that. I would have gone&#xD;
through a jungle of hungry wild beasts&#xD;

brought us together there, a trio; or&#xD;
that you would not have 'looked before&#xD;

of a criminal nature. I could not per-&#xD;
ceive the workings of the infernal ma-&#xD;

screen, and I was 'dead-set' upon ferret-&#xD;

diametrically opposed to his design, for&#xD;
it was the means of exposing your se-&#xD;

To be foiled now after all his bold dar-&#xD;

He had not entertained a thought of&#xD;

and combustible material that partly&#xD;
composed the building would render all&#xD;
ingress or egress impossible, when the&#xD;
alarm was sounded through the silent&#xD;

every attempt of the philanthrophic few&#xD;
to penetrate to the fire-fortified cham-&#xD;

gleamed through his costly fur collar,&#xD;

s    His shrinking spirit expanded some-&#xD;
l .what as he saw the burning linen hurl-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed through the lattice ; it betrayed the&#xD;
fearful condition of the apartment.-&#xD;
They could not possibly survive but a&#xD;
few minutes longer without some means&#xD;
of descent from  the window supplied&#xD;
by the citizens; and Gerald's watchful&#xD;
eye encouraged the hope and belief that&#xD;
that could not be obtained in time suf-&#xD;
ficient to save them from the devouring&#xD;
element. He had heard Mr. Berrien's&#xD;
stentorian lungs shouting "a ladder! a&#xD;
ladder I" as he flew by with a rapidity&#xD;
that bore ample testimony to the ex-&#xD;
citement and solicitude of his generous&#xD;
and noble soul, but Gerald flattered him-&#xD;
self, from the appearance of the build-&#xD;
ing that all would be ended before one&#xD;
could be procured. His soul died with-&#xD;
in him when he saw .Hamilton's prepa-&#xD;
rations for escaping from the chamber&#xD;
-he had not thought of that means-&#xD;
but his spirit rose to the achme of fe-&#xD;
licitous certainty when they fled from&#xD;
the red tongue that protruded through&#xD;
the lattice. The fiend incarnate did not&#xD;
know that ere Hamilton braved the&#xD;
flames, or Mr. Berrien's voice rang out&#xD;
upon the wintry air, suggestion of the&#xD;
last resort, another had shot of,upon&#xD;
the same errand of mercy.&#xD;
Crazy Joe was among the first.who&#xD;
started from their couch of dreams, and&#xD;
rushed to the scene of ruin. Joe stri-&#xD;
ded up the stairs as far as he dared ven-&#xD;
ture for constitutional timidity, and with&#xD;
a yell of horror and anxiety, he darted&#xD;
back again into the open air, and look-&#xD;
ed up at Myrelda. Possessing all the&#xD;
mental weakness of a child, fear and&#xD;
pity, occasioned by the scene, overcame&#xD;
him, and, he burst into tears and loud&#xD;
lamentations. .,Suddenly starting, like&#xD;
a streak, from his position, he brotht&#xD;
one sledge-hammer fist hard down upon&#xD;
the brown palm of his left hand, with&#xD;
the screech: "dog me.!" and went. at&#xD;
the rate of ten knots, from the burning&#xD;
&#xD;
building. No one regarded the "crazy&#xD;
boy's" movements. Joe's race was de-&#xD;
cidedly Gilpin. His tow hair stood out&#xD;
straight behind, and his big brown&#xD;
hands beat the air swiftly, as they&#xD;
swung back and forth, as a means of&#xD;
propelling power. His dilapidated wool&#xD;
hat was carried away by the velocity of&#xD;
his movements, in conjunction with the&#xD;
rushing winds, but he heeded it not.--&#xD;
In his hasteto arrive early at the point&#xD;
of gravitation, Joe had neglected to tie&#xD;
the stout leather strings that held his&#xD;
heavy cowhides to his mammoth pedal&#xD;
dexters, and now, as he ran, one pegged-&#xD;
bottom  kine envelop popped off his&#xD;
hoseless track-maker, and left him stark&#xD;
barefoot upon the frosty giound. Joe&#xD;
gave a tremendous kick with the other&#xD;
peregrinator, and ejected the remaining&#xD;
shoe with such- force and momentum,&#xD;
that it flew up and grazed his ear, as&#xD;
he dashed by it, muttering to himself:&#xD;
" Go to grass, ole shoes ! yer ain't&#xD;
nuthin' but a nuisness, no how. I kin&#xD;
run ten times faster without ye-dog&#xD;
me!    Poor little thing !  Hamilton's&#xD;
gone, too; an' I'm boun' ter git'er out,&#xD;
by !"&#xD;
Now Joe was a strict religionist, and&#xD;
never failed to repent in "sackcloth and&#xD;
ashes," for every involuntary act of pro-&#xD;
fanity, when the excitement that occa-&#xD;
sioned it had subsided; and there he&#xD;
was, eminently superior to thousands of&#xD;
his sex who could boast a clearer and&#xD;
loftier intellect. Joe was an official&#xD;
member of the Second Presbyterian&#xD;
Church-that is, he pumped the wind&#xD;
into the big organ regularly every Sab-&#xD;
bath, and was as proud of his sta-&#xD;
tion as a carpenter's canine with a rule&#xD;
in his mouth; and considered himself&#xD;
entitled to all the immunities of the&#xD;
church militant, simply from this fact;&#xD;
but Joe forgot his religion on the pres-&#xD;
ent occasion, and the fortl1den word&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ry circumstances, Mr. Berrien's gener-&#xD;
ous heart instigated him to make'the&#xD;
proposition as a means of bringing his&#xD;
friend into a more rapid and. extensive&#xD;
practice, through his wide-spread name&#xD;
and reputation, and though indifferent&#xD;
relative to the compensation to be&#xD;
awarded his professional services, Ham-&#xD;
ilton's sole object was to win a distin-&#xD;
guished name in the land of Myrelda's&#xD;
birth. He acceded gratefully, detecting&#xD;
the secret motive of the noble minded&#xD;
man ; also the co-partnership would&#xD;
bring him nearer the temporary home&#xD;
of his betrothed bride.&#xD;
"Heard the news ?" inquired the jo-&#xD;
vial, rubicund-faced  landlord, as he&#xD;
bustled into the room  and rubbed his&#xD;
hands together over the warm stove.&#xD;
"Yes, Sir ; the Dutch have taken&#xD;
Holland"-said Hamilton, as he looked&#xD;
up from the paper with a remarkably&#xD;
sober countenance, but a dash of hu-&#xD;
mor in his dark eyes-"anything more&#xD;
of importance ?"&#xD;
"Out upon your Yankee witticism,"&#xD;
laughed Boniface-"no, no, 'Squire;&#xD;
something of more consequence, by con-&#xD;
siderable; a case of slave abduction by.&#xD;
Northern abolitionists, in our very town,&#xD;
I'm told."&#xD;
"Possible !" returned Hamilton, with&#xD;
a steady, thoughtful glance at his in-&#xD;
terlocutor.&#xD;
Gerald's face colored with animation&#xD;
and measure.&#xD;
"Can't expect anything better, so&#xD;
. long as we permit the -knaves to&#xD;
come among us. I'll swear if it were&#xD;
my slave I'd ferret out the villain at all&#xD;
hazards, and pursue him to the ends of&#xD;
the earth, even for the sake of doing&#xD;
the South a service, by stretching his&#xD;
rascally Yankee neck !"&#xD;
All eyes turned upon Hamilton. at&#xD;
this fiery remark, and intended insult;&#xD;
even Mr. Berrien had ceased his con-&#xD;
&#xD;
versation and looked attentively on ;&#xD;
but Hamilton sat calm and unaffected,&#xD;
seriously regarding the landlord, ap-&#xD;
parently unconscious of Gerald's pres.&#xD;
ence even. His whole air reminded Mr.&#xD;
Berrien of Esop's fable of the fly and&#xD;
the ox.&#xD;
" I'd like to see the rascal strung up&#xD;
blamed-well," said boniface ,giving his&#xD;
stout fingers another vigorous twist over&#xD;
the stove, "but hang me if I can tell&#xD;
whether it would be a southern or a&#xD;
northern neck stretched by the opera-&#xD;
tion. If the slave has been decoyed and&#xD;
sold to replenish the purse of a bred-&#xD;
and-born Virginian, it won't be the first&#xD;
instance of the kind upon record ; but&#xD;
it comes natural to give the credit of&#xD;
such anioutrage to Yankee abolitionists&#xD;
and the burden of the sin is, by com-&#xD;
mon consent, laid upon their shoulders&#xD;
till factstoss it over in a pro-slavery di-&#xD;
rection."&#xD;
"Then nothing positive is ascertain-&#xD;
ed relative to the affair, and no one&#xD;
specially implicated ?" remarked Mr.&#xD;
Berrien.&#xD;
" Nothing definite, as yet, though&#xD;
suspicion rests upon your friend Wilde-&#xD;
man, Mr. Hamilton, who left for New&#xD;
England, yesterday. That garrulous&#xD;
and ubiquitous individual, They say,&#xD;
asserts that the fugitive is now en route&#xD;
for New York under the protection of&#xD;
his abolition friend, and officers Burley&#xD;
and Bragg are .in hot pursuit in that&#xD;
direction."&#xD;
Hamilton's paper had gradually drop-&#xD;
ped to his knee during the landlord's&#xD;
last communication.  The red blood&#xD;
mounted swiftly to his forehead, his&#xD;
black eyes flashed indignant fire, and a'&#xD;
curl of ineffable soul-gontempt and su-&#xD;
preme disgust, became distinctly visible&#xD;
about his stern, proud mouth. He sat&#xD;
silent a moment, steadily regarding&#xD;
mine host, then answered calmly, while&#xD;

&#xD;
his countenance resumed its former&#xD;
quiet and gravity.&#xD;
"Where intimately known, and right-&#xD;
ly appreciated, Mr. Wildeman is above&#xD;
suspicion; yet under the circumstances,&#xD;
I can't be much surprised that his hon-&#xD;
or should be more than questionable,since&#xD;
human nature is prone to suspect even an&#xD;
honorable man, when decieved by one&#xD;
of his class or nation. It is a lamentable&#xD;
fact that villainy is not limited by geo-&#xD;
graphical boundaries; and in Yankee-&#xD;
lund there are ignoble minds,-and soft-&#xD;
head meddlers, who have sought to drop&#xD;
the match of officiousness in the maga-&#xD;
zine of Southern rights, and individual&#xD;
dignity, to explode the National har-&#xD;
mony. But Charles Wildeman don't&#xD;
rank in that category, as the result of&#xD;
this pursuit will most assuredly demon-&#xD;
strate. It can't be expected that we&#xD;
Yankees should be pro-slavery men;&#xD;
the very nature of the circumstances&#xD;
under which we are reared, forbids it;&#xD;
but the honorable men of the North,&#xD;
while opposed to the system of traffick-&#xD;
ing in human flesh and blood, are equal-&#xD;
ly averse to the activity of professed&#xD;
philanthropists to break the chains of&#xD;
slavery by compulsion; which effort, the&#xD;
past has proven, but rivets them the&#xD;
tighter; and their continued exertions,&#xD;
despite the result of former labors,&#xD;
show conclusively, that they are not&#xD;
actuated by a spirit of true philanthro-&#xD;
py; for I call that a doubtful exhibition&#xD;
of the principle, where discord and&#xD;
animosity follow in its steps. In the&#xD;
language of one of your fair and gifted&#xD;
townswomen, the worthy portion of the&#xD;
North, of which Mr- Wildernan is em-&#xD;
phatically one, believe that in the full-&#xD;
ness of time 'the dear God who loveth&#xD;
us, who made and loveth all,' will re-&#xD;
veal His will concerning that which is&#xD;
fermenting the public mind. .If the ef-&#xD;
fort to free our slaves, be of men, it&#xD;
&#xD;
will come to nought, but if it be of God&#xD;
we cannot overthrow it;' and the time&#xD;
will come when the Moses of Conscience&#xD;
will lead the Black Host over the blue&#xD;
Atlantic, and land them safely, upon&#xD;
their own native soil. But if your ra-&#xD;
bid ultras lay the flattering unction to&#xD;
their'souls that Southerners are going&#xD;
to submit to their dictation, they'll be&#xD;
just as much mistaken as the old lady&#xD;
was when she knocked her pudding off&#xD;
the table and said: 'scat!"'&#xD;
"Ha ! ha !" laughed the fun-loving&#xD;
landlord, rubbing his hands together&#xD;
like the grating of corn-shucks-"good.&#xD;
by George ! I recognize the lady, Mr.&#xD;
Hamilton-no mistaking that source !&#xD;
she gave me a shot once that hit just in&#xD;
the right place to be memorable !&#xD;
"Do me the favor to relate it, ifyou&#xD;
please, that I may know if your suspi-&#xD;
cions are correct "-said Hamilton, with&#xD;
a slight smile about his softened mouth.&#xD;
"Why, you see, Sir, I'd heard of her&#xD;
proficiency as reported, and fool-like,&#xD;
I sought for a verbal specimen of her&#xD;
powers, and to effect it, I one day rid-&#xD;
iculed the grandiloquent style of a cer-&#xD;
tain production of hers, and suggested&#xD;
the advisability of writing a second&#xD;
article, explanatory of the first; but&#xD;
finally concluded that - people had no&#xD;
business to read, if they were. obtuse,&#xD;

it might be an everlasting job, with&#xD;
such a mammoth cave to fill up.!'  I&#xD;
haven't run aground on that shoal,&#xD;
since!"&#xD;
A roar of laughter followed this nar-&#xD;
ration; excited;mainly, by the landlord's&#xD;
inimitable manner of relating a joke.&#xD;
Hamilton's face reddened and radiated-&#xD;

&#xD;
HERBERT HAMILTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
with spirit-light, and a slight tremor of&#xD;
mirth agitated his strong frame , but it&#xD;
was a remarkable fact that he had nev,-&#xD;
er been heard to laugh since his resi-&#xD;
dence in.Arlingford.&#xD;
Mr. Berrien's gay voice was distinct-&#xD;
ly heard, as he brought his hand down&#xD;
upon his nearest neighbor's knee with&#xD;
a force that made him flinch, exclaim-&#xD;
ing:&#xD;
"Served you right, old fellow, be&#xD;
hanged! No mistaking that source.-&#xD;
I defy any one to run afoul of that craft&#xD;
and- not get a broadside that will heave&#xD;
him keel upwards. I say, . Hamilton,&#xD;
isn't he correct ?"&#xD;
Hamilton turned, with sparkling eyes.&#xD;
" Undoubtedly; I recognize the au-&#xD;
thor of that, as she to whom I referred.&#xD;
It is characteristic of her independent&#xD;
and sarcastic nature, when the provoca-&#xD;
tion is sufficient to call forth a Greek to&#xD;
Greek collision. My head has often-&#xD;
times gravitated beneath the weight of&#xD;
her ready wit and stinging sarcasm,&#xD;
with astonishing rapidity, with all my&#xD;
'Yankee impudence and professional&#xD;
brass,' as she terms it"-a broad sun-&#xD;
shiney smile overspread his softly flush-&#xD;
ed face.&#xD;
All eyes, but Gerald's were brimful&#xD;
of mirth at this facetious remark of the&#xD;
acknowledged lover and bridegroom&#xD;
elect. Gerald's eyes flashed fierce fire&#xD;
beneath his heavy black brows, and a&#xD;
mortal palenes swept over his cold face.&#xD;
The watchful landlord observed his ex-&#xD;
pression by an askance glance, and shut-&#xD;
ting one eye"'significantly, at the amused&#xD;
Hamilton, returned, laughingly:&#xD;
"«And so 'Squire, to obviate future&#xD;
concussions between you Yankee caput&#xD;
and terra firma, you mean 'to have and&#xD;
to hold' her invincible ladyship, in&#xD;
bonds of everlasting 'love honor and&#xD;
obedience,' and so beconte a slaveholder&#xD;
in spite of principle."&#xD;
&#xD;
"On a small scale,'' replied Hamil-&#xD;
ton, entering into the landldrd's lively&#xD;
spirit. "I would make facts positive&#xD;
an individual screen, and thus escape&#xD;
the annoyance of being overhauled by&#xD;
Messrs. Burley and Bragg, during a&#xD;
northward tour."&#xD;
" Humph !" grunted Gerald, unable&#xD;
longer to restrain his boiling rage,&#xD;
"Southrons are too familiar with such&#xD;
villainous Yankee pretences, to be de-&#xD;
ceived by yours."&#xD;
All faces, even the lively landlords,&#xD;
grew sober at this malicious remark, in&#xD;
evident apprehension of a scene-all&#xD;
but Hamilton's. The harmony of his&#xD;
features remained undisturbed, and he&#xD;
turned his eyes quietly, but piercingly,&#xD;
upon the enraged and jealous Dr. The&#xD;
smile about his lips changed into a curl&#xD;
of' contempt, as he replied with cool&#xD;
sarcasm : .&#xD;
" It is said that experience teaches&#xD;
wisdom; but you, Sir, evidently haven't&#xD;
learned the lessons taught in that school,&#xD;
notwithstanding your long pupilage ;&#xD;
otherwise you would perceive more clear-&#xD;
ly, what vast discredit your unprovoked&#xD;
enmity to me reflects upon you, as a man&#xD;
and a husband."&#xD;
Gerald sprang from his chair, furious&#xD;
with passion at this cutting insinuation,&#xD;
and rushed madly towards the speaker.&#xD;
The solemn-visaged landlord and Mr.&#xD;
Berrien obstructed his way to his calm&#xD;
and scornful tormentor, who leaned&#xD;
against the wall with perfect sang froid,&#xD;
awaiting the manifestation of his furi-&#xD;
ous foe's design. Hamilton waved aside&#xD;
his friends, as he said quietly:&#xD;
"No interference gentlemen, if you&#xD;
please. I'm forced to the conclusion&#xD;
that it -emains for me to teach that&#xD;
worthy son of Esculapius a little dis-&#xD;
cretion and common sense, in both of&#xD;
which he is sadly deficient; and it&#xD;
would be a charity to the ignorant gen-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE BAS BL&#xD;
&#xD;
tlenian to proceed with the lesson forth-&#xD;
with."&#xD;
Gerald writhed with firy, and burst-&#xD;
ing from his captors, plunged wildly&#xD;
forward, and snatched a pistol from his&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
Hamilton's quick eye detected the&#xD;
movement of the madman's hand, and&#xD;
ere he could direct the deadly weapon&#xD;
his strong fingers shut like a vice around&#xD;
Gerald's wrists. He held the enraged&#xD;
Dr. at arm's length, as he said cooly&#xD;
and gravely :&#xD;
" Citizens of Arlingford, you are wit-&#xD;
nesses of the murderous design of the&#xD;
imprisoned gentleman, and I request&#xD;
that a message be despatched to the&#xD;
Sheriff, while I deliver an extempore&#xD;
address to this quivering culprit."&#xD;
He fixed his piercing eye upon the&#xD;
struggling villain, and continued in the&#xD;
same cool and tormenting tone :&#xD;
" My honorable Sir, as you see, I&#xD;
might now inflict corporeal punishment&#xD;
upon you, so far as physical superiority&#xD;
is concerned ; both for your wrongs to&#xD;
an innocent and helpless woman, and&#xD;
your past insolence to, and present wan-&#xD;
ton atack upon me; but I regard it as&#xD;
far beneath my dignity to chastise one&#xD;
so contemptible and infamous as your&#xD;
musked and pomatumed physicianship,&#xD;
and prefer handing you over to the un-&#xD;
gloved fingers of the law, to do the. dir-&#xD;
ty, but most commendable job for me.&#xD;
I have the pleasure and now take the&#xD;
liberty to inform you that since my&#xD;
fist knowledge of your character, which&#xD;
was long before I ever saw your merce-&#xD;
nary lordship, I have looked upon you,&#xD;
whenever I look upon you at all; for&#xD;
you are so far beneath the level of a&#xD;
man, that but for your fice-like obstre-&#xD;
perousness (which will sometimes attract&#xD;
the notice of larger dogs) I should not&#xD;
have strained my ocular vision suffi-&#xD;
ciently to become familiar with your&#xD;
physiognomy."&#xD;
&#xD;
EU. .-77&#xD;
&#xD;
An unavoidable laugh broke, with a&#xD;
smothered sound, from the listeners, at&#xD;
the peculiar language and manner of&#xD;
the speaker, which was, by far, more&#xD;
tormenting to Gerald, than the heartiest&#xD;
kicks and cuffs would have been. Ham-&#xD;
ilton's method of castigating his foe,&#xD;
was as novel as effective; it "bit like a&#xD;
serpent, and stung like an adder," and&#xD;
awarded him a greater victory over his&#xD;
assailant, than gutta percha canes, or&#xD;
Colt's revolvers could have achieved.&#xD;
The convulsed landlord held his nose&#xD;
and slipped behind Gerald to escape ob-&#xD;
servation. An irrepressible smile flitted&#xD;
over Hamilton's face- at the ludicrous-&#xD;
ness of the scene. Gerald writhed and&#xD;
struggled desperately, to escape the iron&#xD;
grasp upon his arms, and finding it a&#xD;
fruitless effort, he directed one patent-&#xD;
leather boot at his custodian's knee, *ith&#xD;
a malignant force that would have floored&#xD;
him, by destroying his equilibrium, but&#xD;
for the support of his captor, whose&#xD;
watchfulness and agility foiled the mis-&#xD;
creant's motive. Hamilton smiled again&#xD;
as he proceeded with his sarcastic ad-&#xD;
dress.&#xD;
"My pugnacious Sir, I am not a bit&#xD;
surprised by this maneuver, singe it is&#xD;
the natural resort of all descendants of&#xD;
the long-eared animal, that once crushed&#xD;
Balam's leg through overwhelming&#xD;
fright, as you fain would mine ; to which&#xD;
species you have but given one more&#xD;
evidence of your near relationship."&#xD;
A burst of laughter ensued, that only&#xD;
enraged and confused Gerald the more;&#xD;
and curses loud and deep were heaped&#xD;
upon his victor's head, Hamilton stood&#xD;
calm and silent, till his victim's seeth-&#xD;
ing and surging rage had effervesced in&#xD;
a torrent of fierce imprecations, and&#xD;
vulgar abuse. He then bowed with&#xD;
mock respect, and continued his two-&#xD;
edged sword slaughter.&#xD;

torturing position; but 'self-prese'vation&#xD;

pardon me for taking the precaution to&#xD;
protect a life that is, just now, of two-&#xD;
fold importance, as it holds the hopes&#xD;
and happiness of another, which is of&#xD;
more value, by far, than a thousand&#xD;
such lives as you have sought to des-&#xD;
troy.- Your past villainy to her has not&#xD;
sufficed your fiendish soul, but you still&#xD;
seek to agonize her woman's heart&#xD;

Gerald; you flatter yourself that be-&#xD;
cause I have disdained to flagelate you&#xD;
for your past intended insults-and here&#xD;
allow me to inform you, that it is not in&#xD;
your power to insult me, Sir-that you&#xD;
can still pursue your unmanly and das-&#xD;

openly, since you have learned your&#xD;
helplessness in my grasp, the assassin s&#xD;
steel will probably do the work that&#xD;
pur-blind passion has this day attempt-&#xD;
ed"&#xD;
Gerald's guilty conscience made him&#xD;
wiuce at this insinuation. The power-&#xD;
less gentleman had frequently essayed to&#xD;
drown his antagonist's voice,'by loud&#xD;
imprecations and defiant language; but&#xD;
Hamilton poured forth a steady stream&#xD;
of distinct words, that confused his&#xD;
ideas, and rendered him passive before&#xD;
the oily flood. Hamilton saw his quail-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing eye, and regarded him sternly a&#xD;
moment in silence.&#xD;
"I detect Huilt in your countenance,&#xD;
my worthy Sir, but shall pursue the even&#xD;
tenor of my way, fearless of your blood-&#xD;
thirsty design, and regardless of your&#xD;
malice. So.far as I am concerned, per-&#xD;
sonally, you will be as though you were&#xD;
not; but should you continue your per-&#xD;
secutions to her, whom it is' my pride,&#xD;
happiness and privilege to protect and&#xD;
defend, and, your jealous malignity&#xD;
should affect her peace of mind or per-&#xD;
'sonal security, while there is vitality in&#xD;
my veins, 1 will pursue you to the ut-&#xD;
termost parts of the earth for vengeance,&#xD;
and though you sat upon the National&#xD;
throne, I would press through an army&#xD;
of bayonets and drench that throne in&#xD;
your villainous heart's blood, in defiance&#xD;
of all the steel in the universe of God!"&#xD;
Gerald cowered before the blaze that~&#xD;
flashed upon him from Hamilton's fierce&#xD;
eye and crimsoned face. The company&#xD;
looked upon each other in silence and&#xD;
wonder. Hamilton turned to the Sheriff&#xD;
as he entered the room, and said, coolly:&#xD;
"For a wanton attempt upon my life, I&#xD;
deliver Dr. Frederick Gerald &amp;amp; your&#xD;
custody, Sir, for trial, according to law."&#xD;
The stout functionary laid his hand&#xD;
upon the culprit's arm, and marched&#xD;
him off, fuming and livid with rage and&#xD;
deep mortification. Gerald was bound&#xD;
over to keep the peace, in the sum ,of&#xD;
$10,000, his brother-in-law becoming&#xD;
bondsman.&#xD;
The landlord dropped into a chair,&#xD;
and sraightened himself out at full&#xD;
length, while his corpulent person shook&#xD;
convulsively, with long smothered mer-&#xD;
riment, after Gerald's departure.&#xD;
"Gad!t if that don't take the rag off&#xD;

A  few  hours subsequent. Gerald's&#xD;
dissolute friend and  associate, Augus-&#xD;

bearing a challenge from the enraged&#xD;

for an approaching County Term to be&#xD;

Aringford, where he had recently been&#xD;

his association with Mr. Berrien. It&#xD;
was to be his debut in his legal capaci-&#xD;
ty, and as thp fame of his abilities had&#xD;
preceded him, Hamilton labored to sus-&#xD;
tain it in - propria personae.,lie was&#xD;
absorbed for the accomplishmentwof&#xD;
this o1 ect, when Smith entered, un-&#xD;
ceremoniously, with a pompous air,&#xD;
meant to impress Hamilton with an&#xD;
overwhelming sense of his superiority,&#xD;
and presented the challenge.&#xD;
Possessing a knowledge of his character'&#xD;
both from rumor and observation Ham-&#xD;
ilton;had ever avoided contact with the&#xD;
unprincipled masculine, and passed him&#xD;
by in silence and unnoticed. Thrust&#xD;
now into his immediate presence, with-&#xD;
out will or desire on his part, he receiv-&#xD;
ed. him with coolpoliteness, that every&#xD;
well-bred man will evince, under all cir-&#xD;
cumstances, and waved him with grave&#xD;
dignity to a chair, previous to examin-&#xD;
ing the contents of the aristocratic look-&#xD;
ing note.&#xD;
Smith dropped indolently upon a&#xD;
&#xD;
chair, with a yawn of seerliing indiffer,&#xD;
ence respecting the facts in the case, or&#xD;
the individual presence; then swinging&#xD;
the right foot upon the left knee, heloll-&#xD;
ed back as far as prudence dictated, and&#xD;
tapping the farthest boot-toe, with his&#xD;
gold-mounted rattan, whistled an ac-&#xD;
companiment; thus betraying his vul-&#xD;
garity and plebian blood, by a show of&#xD;
independence and monied superiority.&#xD;
Incensed by Hamilton's indifference-&#xD;
concerning his august person, and en-&#xD;
vious of his fame, he had honored \him&#xD;
with the distinguishing titles of "green&#xD;
Yankee," and "lie-for-a-living," and at-&#xD;
tached himself to Gerald's cause with&#xD;
a zeal inspired more by wounded self-&#xD;
.sufficiency, than friendship for-the Dr.&#xD;
He was an ardent abettor of the pres-&#xD;
ent plot, that contemplated Hamilton's&#xD;
life; for despite the disparity in their&#xD;
pecuniary circumstances, as he fancied,&#xD;
like Haman of old, his supposed supe-&#xD;
riority in that respect availed him noth-&#xD;
ing, "so long as he saw Mordecai, the&#xD;
Jew sitting at the king's gate."  He&#xD;
watched Hamilton's countenance nar-&#xD;
rowly, as he perused the note, and was&#xD;
rather disconcerted by its expression;&#xD;
but his spirit rose ere long, from a most&#xD;
tormenting depth into which he was&#xD;
quite unexpectedly plunged,&#xD;
Hamilton- laid the letter open upon&#xD;
the desk-lid, and turned gravely to his&#xD;
visitor ; brought. one polished boot over&#xD;
the instep of the other foot, folded his&#xD;
arms, and leaned in proud majesty&#xD;
against the desk.&#xD;
Smith's eyes swept from his head to&#xD;
his feet rapidly; he took him all in, in&#xD;
an instant. His delicate rattan ceased&#xD;
its tattooing "right suddenly; his chair&#xD;
tilted forward, and the impertinent&#xD;
whistle became indistinct, as his right&#xD;
foot slid silently to the floor. The su-&#xD;
percilious, self-complacent air of the&#xD;
bigot and fop, was superceded by the&#xD;

and looked strangely crest-fallen at thp&#xD;

The bald-headed emigrant from. La&#xD;

caught Mr. Berrien's eye, who' . wis&#xD;
brimful of mirth at the   scene, but&#xD;
struggled to repress it-' He caught his&#xD;
associate's hand, and drew 'it quickly&#xD;
within his arm.&#xD;
"Come, let us get out of this, or I&#xD;

mirthful twinkle of his blue eyes.\&#xD;
"That, is my design; and if the sale is&#xD;
slow, I wish you to oppose me to the&#xD;

Mr. Berrien's orbs expanded with&#xD;
amazement.&#xD;
"For whom do you act ?" he asked, im-&#xD;
pulsively.&#xD;
"'For myself; lam going to have that,&#xD;

tone that well nigh rooted Mr. Berrien&#xD;
to the spot.&#xD;
" That ! why it's w6rth twenty thou-&#xD;

to his affianced, by a warm grasp of the&#xD;
hand. They stood now, in the broad,&#xD;
beautiful grove surrounding Mr. Lynn's&#xD;
residence. Mr. Clyde stood near them,&#xD;
and on perceiving their proximity,turned&#xD;
and entered into conversation respecting&#xD;
the object of convention.&#xD;
" I should like-to purchase the place&#xD;
myself," said Clyde pompously. "But&#xD;
they're'the meanest, cussedest terms ever&#xD;
heard of in creation ! Who the devil&#xD;
does Lynn think can finger twenty thou-&#xD;

money-tight-times as these ? I'm told&#xD;
he values it at twenty thousand, and&#xD;
won't let it go for less, though he only&#xD;

"I'll go one more, by - ,!" said&#xD;
Clyde, with a remarkably red face. "I&#xD;

Smith ran him to twelve thousand,&#xD;
notwig standing .his assertion to ihmn-&#xD;

"I'll be cussed if I go another cent,"&#xD;
growled Clyde, pulling up his shirt-col-&#xD;

shot of molassas-colored saliva into the&#xD;
drenched leaves. Mr. Berrien glanced&#xD;
at Hamilton, and rubbed his nose to&#xD;
Screen his niirthful countenance,&#xD;
"Twelve thousand ! twelve thousand!&#xD;

"Thirteen thousand," said Mr. Lynn,&#xD;
brother of the proprietor. Smith op-&#xD;

" And that's my last," said ho angrily.'&#xD;
"I shan't give him one dollar more ! He&#xD;
didn't pay that by four thousand, and&#xD;

"Fifteen thousand," said 'Hamilton&#xD;
distinctly.&#xD;
All eyes turned upon hit in aston-&#xD;
ishinent. He stood calm and grave, and&#xD;
took the fire manfully. Clyde's look of&#xD;
'wonderment finally changed to one of&#xD;
*njrth.&#xD;
"You're caught there, Sir !" he said&#xD;
to Hamilton, laughingly,  "A burnt&#xD;

Hamilton smiled. Gerald turned to-&#xD;
wards him haughtily, with a look of&#xD;
ritunph,&#xD;
"I As I don't want this property, you&#xD;
&#xD;
may have it, so far as I am concerned."&#xD;
1 Thank you," returned Hamilton,&#xD;
with a Chesterfieldian bow, and touch-&#xD;
ing his hat politely to the Dr.&#xD;
- The race was 'now between Hamilton&#xD;
and the proprietor's by-bidder. Lynn,&#xD;
the proprietor, looked over at his an-&#xD;
tagonist in amazement, at each succes-&#xD;
sive opposition ; he had mounted him-&#xD;
self upon oie of the numerous rustic&#xD;
benches in the wide grove, to obtain a&#xD;
fair view of his countenance, and scru-&#xD;
tinized  him sharply. Hamilton was&#xD;
forced ,to exert his strong will to the&#xD;
utmost to maintain a grave aspect. The&#xD;
contest was even and moderate between&#xD;
the belligerants. Hamilton intention-&#xD;
ally bid but little above Lynn, to pro-&#xD;
long the fun.&#xD;
Who the devil is' he ?" asked the&#xD;
fat man who insulted crazy Joe, at the&#xD;
Lyceunm. "Thought he was poor as&#xD;

"So did I!" returned his interlocu-&#xD;
tor. "knuess there's an understanding&#xD;
between'em. It won't fall on his hands.&#xD;
I'll wager; he can't pay twenty thou-&#xD;

brother-in-law.&#xD;
" Nineteen thousand," cried Lynn.&#xD;
"Nine hundred and ninety-nine dol-&#xD;

ton, with a queer compresson of his&#xD;
firm lips. A laugh went up from the&#xD;
crowd at this bid.&#xD;
"Ninety-eight  cents  over  that,"&#xD;
laughed Lynn.&#xD;
"Twenty thousand."&#xD;

Mr. Lynn sprang from his elevation,&#xD;
and hastened to his successor.&#xD;
Do you purchase for 'yourself, or&#xD;

"For myself, sir" replied Hamilton,&#xD;
with an irrepressible suile at Lynn's&#xD;
expression;- 'and if you will accompa-&#xD;

It's a  ---- Yankee cheat "--re-&#xD;
turned Gerald, fiercely, "he'll never&#xD;
get possession of. this place !" and his&#xD;
mad eyes swept with envious rage over&#xD;
the beautiful residence. "He's going&#xD;
to settle the business now, at any rate,"&#xD;
responded Clyde, as he haoked after the&#xD;
retreating flanilton, Beri'ien and 1Lnn,&#xD;
with Joe following hard behind, toss&#xD;
ing up a quarter triumphantly, the gift&#xD;
of his benefactor.       -&#xD;
Joe had uttered a yell that shook the t&#xD;
tree-boughs above him. as the property&#xD;
was knocked off to Hamilton, and turned&#xD;
a delighted summersault, that landed&#xD;
him plump in Mr. Clyde's tobacco-pud-s&#xD;
die. Joe picked himself up, with a h&#xD;
scramble and grunt, and catching hold v&#xD;
of the seat of his breeches, with finger o&#xD;
and thumb, twisted his short neck to a&#xD;
the rear, to view the mischief done, ex-&#xD;
clhimiug with a rueful visage. that con- s&#xD;
vulsed the crowd : "Ef I hain't spilte a&#xD;
my new trousers, dog me !"            f&#xD;
To indemnify him for the damage n&#xD;
done to his inexpressibles. Hamilton h&#xD;
had humorously flung him   the 'silver&#xD;
coin, that burned Joe's fingers till he w&#xD;
arrived at the nearest confectionary. i&#xD;
"He shan't take possession of' this jin&#xD;
place, if he does settle the business,"&#xD;
maid Gerald, mentally, as he left the 1&#xD;
&#xD;
wide grove. "I'll be eternally -  ,&#xD;
if he does! lHe's going to Fairville to-&#xD;
morrow, 1 find, and the route lies&#xD;
through a thinly populated country. .If&#xD;
that scoundrel, Berrien, goes, I'll finish&#xD;
him too, the knave !" his eyes flashed&#xD;
fierce fire, as he planned for to-morrow&#xD;

-sE81FEAR1|&#xD;
Mr. Clyde entered the room where&#xD;
Mabel sat at the piano, practicing a&#xD;
new song, and Lora-lay upon an estrade&#xD;
in dishabille, weeping over Eugene&#xD;
Sue's story of "Woman's Love." It&#xD;
coincided with Lora's ideas, point blank;&#xD;
she, too, would imitate the example of&#xD;
the hapless heroine, and plunge into the&#xD;
ocean-waters in the very spot at which&#xD;
he went ,down, under similar circum-&#xD;
stances. There was something so no-&#xD;
ble. in the sacrifice ! She had no doubt&#xD;
but Sue's heroine went up from a wa-&#xD;
tery grave, to Paradise, on the wings of&#xD;
angels ! She thought Sue a very mor-&#xD;
al writer, and admired his lady's con-&#xD;
tancy, and deep devotion, and wept for&#xD;
her unfortunate fate; when the truth&#xD;
was, Lora Clyde was no more capable&#xD;
f loving truly and disinterestedly than&#xD;
parrot was of teaching French.&#xD;
" Guess who bought the Lynn place,"&#xD;
aid Mr. Clyde, as he dropped down&#xD;
mid the velvet cushions, elevated his&#xD;
eet upon the fender, and fired a tre-&#xD;
mendous quid into the grate, through&#xD;
is knees.&#xD;
"Theodore Clyde, Esq." said Lora,&#xD;
ith a smile of proud satisfaction, start-&#xD;
ng up, forgetful of Sue's model hero-&#xD;
ie.&#xD;
Not exactly. Guess again."&#xD;
" Now, Pa. didn't you buy that charm.&#xD;

ing residence, as you promised ?" in-&#xD;
quired Lora, in a tone of peevish dis-&#xD;
appointment, dropping upon afanteuil,&#xD;
and looking up promptly, at the old&#xD;
gentleman.&#xD;
" I'll be cussed if I did !" said Clyde,&#xD;
laying himself back, at full length, and&#xD;
squirting a fresh mouthful of Virginia&#xD;
abstraction towards the grate ; half of&#xD;
which fell short of"its destination, and&#xD;
lodged upon the hearth, in a black pool.&#xD;
"Guess again."&#xD;
But Lora felt no disposition to com-&#xD;
ply; she was too disappointed and an-&#xD;
gry, and sat silent and sullen. Mr.&#xD;
Clyde looked towards Mabel, who re-&#xD;
clined against the piaio, with one hand&#xD;
supporting her graceful head, the other&#xD;
playing with her watch-chain,&#xD;
"Come, Bell, try your powers; what&#xD;
the deuce are you smiling at so myste-&#xD;
riously ?"&#xD;
" At the memory of my dream, last&#xD;
night, of which I have been reminded&#xD;
since you came in, Pa," replied Mabel,&#xD;
laughingly.&#xD;
" Oh, the devil take your dream !--,&#xD;
That's nothing to do with the question.&#xD;
Guess who bought the Lynn place, I&#xD;
say."&#xD;
" Well, Pa, I'll make a .wild guess,&#xD;
and say, Mr. Hamilton."&#xD;
Clyde started bolt up ight in amaze-&#xD;
ment, while Lora sent forth a loud laugh&#xD;
of derision.&#xD;
"What the, Beelzebub made you&#xD;
think so ?" Clyde stared at her in&#xD;
blank astonishment.&#xD;
" I didn't really think so, Pa; I only&#xD;
-I guessed from-it may not be Mr.&#xD;
Hamilton, but I reckon the sale will&#xD;
put it again in Myrelda's possession,"&#xD;
Mabel blundered and blushed.&#xD;
"Well, I'll be blown to the farthest&#xD;
corner of creation, if that don't get over&#xD;
me !" said Clyde, dropping down again&#xD;
and emphasizing his declaration, by&#xD;
&#xD;
ejecting a yard-long stream of saliva,&#xD;
into the hissing fire.&#xD;
"Who was it, pa ?" urged Lora, now&#xD;
doubly curious, from the old gentle-&#xD;
man's appearance.&#xD;
" Who ! why I'll be cussed if the&#xD;
girl hain't guessed it."&#xD;
Lora now sprang to her feet, me-&#xD;
chanically, and half screamed in her&#xD;
excitement:&#xD;
"Pa, Hamilton, didn't buy     that&#xD;
place ?"&#xD;
" Cuss me if he didn't !" said Clyde,&#xD;
giving a squirt through his fingers to-&#xD;
wards the grate, that shot over and&#xD;
plastered the mantel.&#xD;
" Herbert Hamilton buy that elegant&#xD;
home !" Lora ftad dropped down again,&#xD;
and sat looking very white and seriously&#xD;
at the crimson coals. "What did he&#xD;
pay for it Y"&#xD;
".Twenty thousand dollars,every cent&#xD;
of it." Mr. Clyde gave the fender an&#xD;
impulsive punch, that made it rattle, as&#xD;
he thought of his own defeat.&#xD;
" Twenty-thousand dollars ! Herbert&#xD;
Hamilton pay twenty thousand dollars!&#xD;
Never ! It's a cheat, Pa; he ain't worth&#xD;
it."  Lora was walking the floor, pas-&#xD;
sionately.&#xD;
"I'll be cussed if I don't believe he&#xD;
is. I always saw something in him a&#xD;
little remarkable." said Clyde, laying&#xD;
back, and inserting his hands to the&#xD;
lowest depths of his trowsers pockets.&#xD;
Mabel had left the piano stool, and&#xD;
was going round the room in a graceful&#xD;
waltz, with a queer smile upon her red&#xD;
lips. Lora looked daggers at her slen-&#xD;
der form as it floated over the carpet.&#xD;
" You seem transported with~ the&#xD;
news, Miss Clyde," she said sneeringly.&#xD;
"I am, Loo. The wronged are now&#xD;
righted. I love to see the righteous&#xD;
triumph." A clear laugh gushed troi&#xD;
her small mouth.&#xD;
"-It's the greatest piece of romance I&#xD;
&#xD;
9             HERBERT hA ILTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
ever read of in any novel," remarked&#xD;
Clyde, half laughing, half mortified.-&#xD;
"I don't know how he could contain&#xD;
himself so long. I couldn't a-done it.&#xD;
I should a-let the cobbler out long ago,&#xD;
and showed Smith I wasn't such a poor&#xD;
' lie for a living' as he supposed. I&#xD;
reckon Guss will feel a little streaked&#xD;
after this. He looked like a sheep&#xD;
killing dog when Hamilton bid it off.&#xD;
Poor fellow ! I wouldn't be in his shoes&#xD;
for his stockings. Hamilton was the&#xD;
most important nfan in town before the&#xD;
knowledge-of his wealth, and now he'll&#xD;
stand upon the highest round of the&#xD;
ladder. Money will give a fellow a&#xD;
boost in public estimation, I don't care&#xD;
what his talents or intellectual powers&#xD;
are. ' Money makes the mare go' a&#xD;
little faster. Well, I'm glad I always&#xD;
treated him as a gentleman in spite of&#xD;
his supposed poverty ;. and npw I want&#xD;
you to pay him every attention, and his&#xD;
bride elect, too. It won't do to be be-,&#xD;
hind the times. Belle, you are on&#xD;
terms of friendship with her, and if Lo&#xD;
had had half sense she would have sent&#xD;
Myrelda an invitation to that last party,&#xD;
and kept her temper down. I am&#xD;
afraid Hamilton will never forgive that&#xD;
slight, for he's heart and soul given to&#xD;
the girl, and any insult to her will flash&#xD;
through him like lightning. His de-&#xD;
votion to her is the town talk. Henley,&#xD;
who was present at the time of Gerald's&#xD;
assault, told me that Hamilton swore if&#xD;
the Doctor hurt one of her little fin-&#xD;
gers, he'd deluge the whole earth a mile&#xD;
deep in his villainous heart's blood, if&#xD;
he had to go through hell after him,&#xD;
and every sword and dagger in creation&#xD;
were to be thrust through him for the&#xD;
murder, or something like that equally&#xD;
strong. Gerald's the biggest fool in&#xD;
Christendom, and his wife the greatest&#xD;
dupe, 'She's jealous enough, the Lord&#xD;
knows; but the Doctor plays his cards&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE BAS BLEJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
well and could make her believe the&#xD;
earth stood-on a terrapin's back if he'd&#xD;
give her a kiss with the assertion.-&#xD;
Some women are weak cisterns, and&#xD;
can't see- the length of their nose. If&#xD;
she'd been all right in the upper story&#xD;
she wouldn't a-had him after deserting&#xD;
Myrelda. Lord knows, it's the great-&#xD;
est providential blessing that could&#xD;
a-been dropped down to her ; now she'll&#xD;
get a man that's worth having, and rich&#xD;
as cream into the bargain; for Myrelda&#xD;
never would a-writ poetry if she hadn't&#xD;
been pushed up to it by that trouble;&#xD;
and her poetry's won her a husband&#xD;
that every girl in town would give their&#xD;
two eyes to get: He courted her three&#xD;
years by letter they say, but the Doctor&#xD;
like to a-put her light lout by his slan-&#xD;
derous whispers, I am told. Well, it's&#xD;
an interesting piece of business through-&#xD;
out, and I want you to prepare to give&#xD;
them a bridal entertainment after their&#xD;
nuptials. It won't do to be at variance&#xD;
with the wife of Herbert Hamilton.-&#xD;
And, by the way, Charles is coming&#xD;
home, right speedily; coming to the&#xD;
wedding, I suspect; and I shouldn't&#xD;
wonder if he's rich as John Jacob As-&#xD;
tor, too, for one good luck always brings&#xD;
company, and when it rains it pours."&#xD;
Mabel had ceased her airy move-&#xD;
ment, and stood looking through the&#xD;
window. Her face flushed crimson at&#xD;
this last piece of information, and grew&#xD;
white as Parian marble; her slight&#xD;
form trembled visibly as' she leaned&#xD;
against the casement, but no one ob-&#xD;
served her agitation. She stood there&#xD;
till her nerves recuperated, then went&#xD;
composedly back to the piano, so far as&#xD;
externals were concerned. Sweet Ma-&#xD;
bel ! There was a trembling secret&#xD;
nestling away down in the nunnery of&#xD;
that pure young heart that none but&#xD;
Charles Montford had ever suspected.&#xD;

sensibly, beneath the heart-thrilling&#xD;
kiss he pressed upon her lips.&#xD;
"Do you fear for me, Myrelda ?"&#xD;
" Yes, Sir !"&#xD;
" And why, darling ?"&#xD;
" That man is destined to be my&#xD;
cvil genius, through life, I .fear, tier-&#xD;

"' That man ?' Who" ?&#xD;
"That monster; Gerald !"'&#xD;
hailtoi gave a quick, irivoluatarfy&#xD;
start, backward, and essayed to mislead&#xD;
her as to the cause.&#xD;
" It's going to rain, puss ; that toe&#xD;
pinches like seven hundred !" ,&#xD;
Myrelda smiled, unavoidably, at the&#xD;
ludicrous contortions of his face.&#xD;
" Why don't you apply the oil of&#xD;
wormwood, Herbert ?" she asked, laugh-&#xD;
ingly, "It's an infallible remedy, and&#xD;
ought to be proclaimed to the four&#xD;
quarters of the globe. I'll publish it&#xD;
myself, as a charity to mankind.''&#xD;
" I'll prove it, by George !" he mut-&#xD;
tered, with well feigned symptoms of&#xD;
annoyance.  "But tell me plainly, My-&#xD;
relda, why do   you fear Gerald, as&#xD;
consummate a coward as ever walked&#xD;
the earth ?"&#xD;
" A snake in the grass is more dan-&#xD;
gerous than one we can see, and pre-&#xD;
pare for. Havn't I cause for appre-&#xD;
hension, Herbert ?" She laid her -lead&#xD;
back upon -his shoulder, and looked up&#xD;
into his eyes, with an expression that&#xD;
puzzled him.&#xD;
" Now what does that mean ? I'll&#xD;
own I can't read the riddle written in&#xD;
those eyes. There's a meaning in it&#xD;
too abstruse for my powers. Speak&#xD;
plainly, and tell me all you think."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Then, plainly, sir. I think he would&#xD;
do secretly what his violent passions&#xD;
have inipelled him to attewnpt openly !"&#xD;
Hamilton started again, and gave his&#xD;
toe the credit.&#xD;
" Openly ! what am I to understand&#xD;
by that, pray ?"&#xD;
"Now, don't affect ignorance, sir.-&#xD;
I know all, Herbert !" She burst into&#xD;
tears, and sobbed in heart-anguish up-&#xD;
on his swelling bosom. Hamilton knew&#xD;
how deeply he was loved, as he held&#xD;
her quivering form closely to his breast;&#xD;
and the thought unnerved him.&#xD;
" How did you learn that, Myrelda?"&#xD;
"4Through the servants, this morn-&#xD;
ing, who were not aware of being over-,&#xD;
heard."&#xD;
He set his lips firmly together, and&#xD;
his black eyes flashed fury; but sup-&#xD;
pressing his indignation, he said with&#xD;
assumed pleasantry :&#xD;
" I'll take you away, soon, where the&#xD;
black imps can't disturb your quiet. I&#xD;
have sought to keep you in ignorance&#xD;
of that absurd act, to avoid distressing&#xD;
you, unnecessarily. I feared your weak&#xD;
woman's heart"-he pinched her plump&#xD;
chin, and curved his proud mouth, with&#xD;
affected -disdain--"would be intimida-&#xD;
ted and constantly troubled by that&#xD;
knowledge. He is too dastardly to at-s&#xD;
tempt it, whatever may be his fearn-&#xD;
ings to that effect ; his cowardly fears&#xD;
of being suspected, after all that has&#xD;
transpired, particularly on that occasion,&#xD;
will deter him, I don't fea1 him, Myrel-&#xD;
" No, sir, you wouldn't fear to march&#xD;
up, single handed, and face 'an army&#xD;
with banners.' If there were an atom&#xD;
of fear in, you, my life would not now&#xD;
peril your own."  Tears filled her eyes&#xD;
again, but she bit her lip and struggled&#xD;
to crush them back.&#xD;
" But the whole earth is bright andI&#xD;
beautiful, even in its winter garments,&#xD;
&#xD;
and life very der to me now, Myrelda;&#xD;
and the probability of losing it and&#xD;
you would doubtless make Mme fear and&#xD;
tremble. I should not fear to die i I&#xD;
knew I should carry you in ,my arms&#xD;
over the death flood, and live with you&#xD;
in eternity."&#xD;
She looked up with an expression&#xD;
that Herbert Hamilton saw in his lash&#xD;
hour, as she uttered the words: "we&#xD;
shall not long be separated, Herbert, if&#xD;
you cross the Jordan first."&#xD;
" Love for you has led me to hope&#xD;
and trust for life hereafter; and if God,&#xD;
gives you to my arms on earth, through&#xD;
His grace I will hold, you there in&#xD;
heaven."&#xD;
She closed her moist eyes With a&#xD;
bright smile, and Hamilton caught the&#xD;
whisper " saved," as her small handy&#xD;
met in a devotional clasp and were-laid&#xD;
softly upon his arm.&#xD;
He drew out his watch. "There, if I&#xD;
tarry longer I shall lose my credit, and&#xD;
bring reproach upon you ;" humorously.&#xD;
She dropped her face upon hisibreast&#xD;
and sat silent some time. He held her&#xD;
there, without a word, till she raised&#xD;
her head and untwined her arms from&#xD;
his neck.&#xD;
"There, that will shield me," he said&#xD;
smilingly.&#xD;
"11 hat, Herbert ?"&#xD;
"That prayer. Itcreptright through&#xD;
my vest pocket and told the whole&#xD;
story to a little monitor on the other&#xD;
side.' Like Jonah, I could go forty&#xD;
days and nights in the strengthof it.&#xD;
Now don't be distressed about me." He&#xD;
looked at her earnestly and, inquiringly;&#xD;
Myrelda swallowed down her anguished&#xD;
emotions,and raised her eyes with asmile.&#xD;
" And now, in return foryours, ,pray;&#xD;

sofa to a kneeling posture, and drawn&#xD;
her gently beside him. He held her&#xD;
thus some moments in silence, his face&#xD;
bowed upon her head.-&#xD;
Myrelda hastened up to her chamber&#xD;
when. the door closed upon his majestic&#xD;
form, and in its mournful hush, her&#xD;
petit-up misery gushed forth, The black&#xD;
cloud had culminated in the zenith of&#xD;
her sky, and the wild storm broke furi-&#xD;
ously over the green things in the gar-&#xD;
den of her heart. Dr. Merton soon found&#xD;
her in a state of high nervous excite-&#xD;
tient, and left her in unconsciousness,&#xD;
with Aunt Linder anxiously watching&#xD;
her restless slumber.{&#xD;
Herbert Hamilton was too brave to&#xD;
carry deadly weapons, about his person,&#xD;
in a civilized community; he had never&#xD;
descended to that mean and cowardly&#xD;
habit; and though target-shooting was&#xD;
an early practice that had rendered him&#xD;
perfect as a marksman, he had not pos-&#xD;
sessed one since his sojourn in Virginia,&#xD;
having presented his own, to a friend in&#xD;
New   England, after his return from&#xD;
abroad, which friend was preparing for a&#xD;
journey to Oregon.&#xD;
But Myrelda's presentiment, Gerald's&#xD;
known villainy, and the loneliness of the&#xD;
road over which he must pass, where a&#xD;
murder and robbery had been committed&#xD;
even since his residence in Arlingford,&#xD;
decided him to appropriate the weapon&#xD;
of Mr. Berrien, with whichhe had given&#xD;
Smith the astounding proof of his pro-&#xD;
ficiency, and which had since remained&#xD;
in the office.&#xD;
He artfully loaded and capped the&#xD;
instrument, with the mental ejaculation:&#xD;
"God ave me from the necessity of&#xD;
shedding life blood," and mounting his&#xD;
fiery charger, a powerful, prancing an-&#xD;
imal, he put spurs to the snorting steed,&#xD;
and dashed off towards Fairville.- As&#xD;
Geraldhad said,the country was sparsely&#xD;
populated, and on either side of the road,&#xD;
&#xD;
in some portions, dense with underbrush&#xD;
that defied the organs of sight to pene-&#xD;
trate fifteen feet from the highway.&#xD;
Hamilton had lingered so long with&#xD;
Myrelda, that he found it necessary to&#xD;
proceed as fast as possible, in order to&#xD;
reach Fairville in time for the com-&#xD;
mencement of the Court-session. He&#xD;
had arrived at the loneliest, and darkest&#xD;
spot upon his route, and as the bravest&#xD;
man, under some circumstances, will&#xD;
feel a little restlessness creeping over his&#xD;
inner life, at the fancy of a pistol muzzle&#xD;
taking deadly aim at his heart, through&#xD;
the dark, Hamilton's black eyes swept,&#xD;
piercingly along each side of the dense&#xD;
way, and he urged his horse to a quicker&#xD;
pace. There was no fear in his iron na-&#xD;
ture; he could have marched up to the&#xD;
cannon's mouth ijnshrinking, but My-&#xD;
rilda's solicitude was in his mind, and a;&#xD;
feeling of suspense, that ever renders&#xD;
the anticipation of an event worse than&#xD;
the reality, induced him to wish for more&#xD;
open, and less suspicious quarters.&#xD;
An explosion echoed beside him, as&#xD;
his spurs touched the animal's side ; the&#xD;
wild beast bolted, at the startling sound,&#xD;
as the loud report of fire-arms-broke the&#xD;
solitude far and wide. Hamilton drew,&#xD;
the stout reins tightly in his powerful&#xD;
hand, and snatching the pistol from his&#xD;
breast, wheeled the frightened horse in&#xD;
the direction of the fire, as a second&#xD;
shot from the concealed foe woke the&#xD;
deep woods from their slumber. The&#xD;
frantic steed reared and plunged, and&#xD;
bolting from the enemy, dashed madly&#xD;
along the highway, in the direction of&#xD;
Fairville, leaving the noble form of his&#xD;
late rider upon the ground, and a third&#xD;
shot quickened the clatter Qf his flying&#xD;
feet !&#xD;

to kill her, and commit suicide, when&#xD;

Gerald turned on his heel, and strode&#xD;
out into the street, with a gay whistle,,&#xD;
leaving hjs simple wife: smiling satisfac-&#xD;
tory, at the prediction which evinced&#xD;
his contempt for her whilom rival. He&#xD;
passed Mr. Berrien's, as Hamilton was&#xD;
ascending the steps.. Gerald compressed&#xD;
his lips, and gave his horse an irritable'&#xD;
cut with his riding whip, that soon&#xD;
carriedhimbeyond the corporation limit.&#xD;
"It's his last visit I" he. muttered,&#xD;
fiercely; "let him make the most of it!"&#xD;
He galloped, on, and gained the deep&#xD;
wpod , securedhis charger,, and went&#xD;
cautioly towards the, highway. He&#xD;
had left, his own weapons behind, laid&#xD;
out infull view, upon his,wife's bureau,&#xD;
They, should not witness against him he&#xD;
had .planned well.- He drew forth, the&#xD;
new, pistols. and carefully examinedthe&#xD;
caps. He had nerved himself for the,&#xD;
blQody deed with a powerful dose of&#xD;
French{brandy; and supplied himself&#xD;
with a flask full of the courage-eleva-&#xD;
ting beverage, to sustain him through&#xD;
&#xD;
the ordeal; but despite th e stimulating&#xD;
fluid, his nerves collapsed, as the sound&#xD;
of hoofs came up the still, road to his&#xD;
listening ear, and faster grew his heart-&#xD;
beats as they neared him.&#xD;
Gerald stationed himself behind .,a&#xD;
sturdy tree-trunk, and peeped through&#xD;
the brush-barrier, for the first glimpse&#xD;
of his victim.  His nervous finger&#xD;
brought the hammer upon, the first cap,&#xD;
as Hamilton came in sight, and had it&#xD;
discharged the barrel, he would have&#xD;
been spared the effort of pulling twice;&#xD;
but the quick bolt of the startled horse,&#xD;
bore his rider in advance of tha first&#xD;
eying ball, and the spasmotic move-&#xD;
ments of the restive animal, as Hamil-&#xD;
ton wheeled him irresistibly towards&#xD;
thehidden foe, saved him from the se-&#xD;
cond whzzing bullet, as it whistled&#xD;
over the frantic steed.&#xD;
Gerald's hand dropped, from sheer&#xD;
excitement, as he saw Hamilton fall,&#xD;
satisfied of success; but his hair stood&#xD;
on end with fright when he beheld him&#xD;
bound up from the earth, apparently&#xD;
unharmed, and plunge into the , under-&#xD;
brush, in eveident search of his foe,&#xD;
grasping the pistol, and firm as rocks&#xD;
in apearanceL&#xD;
If Hamilton's eye rested upon him,&#xD;
he was was a dead man to a_ certainty;&#xD;
Smith's assertion that he would slide&#xD;
right down the tree, and give up if&#xD;
Hamilton were about to fire at him!&#xD;
flashed- through the -cowardly  villian's&#xD;
mind and dropping his weapon, uncop-&#xD;
sciously, in his extreme fright, he dar-&#xD;
ted from the old tree-trunk; and if. the&#xD;
boughs above him had possessed  eyes,&#xD;
they would have witnessed some. long&#xD;
strides and tall steps from the flying&#xD;
miscreant!&#xD;
Hamilton saw the, shaking of thq&#xD;
bushes through whichhe sped, and fir-&#xD;
ing in that direction, followed hard in&#xD;
lyis wake. The discharge gave no great-&#xD;
&#xD;
er impetus to Hamilton's horse, than to&#xD;
Gerald's heels; and he shot through the&#xD;
woods like an arrow, in search of his&#xD;
fleet-footed steed; but the animal had&#xD;
disappeared I Perhaps he had been&#xD;
alarmed by the firing, and escaped&#xD;
homeward. In dispair, Gerald bolted&#xD;
into an old hollow tree, and awaited in&#xD;
trrpidation of soul, the coming up of&#xD;
the enemy, pistol in hand, for a defen-&#xD;
sive shot.  But no sound of pursuit&#xD;
disturbed his guilty soul.&#xD;
In his race, Hamilton's foot became&#xD;
entangled in a wild vine, that would&#xD;
have laid him at full length upon the&#xD;
soil, had he not grasped a slender sap-&#xD;
ling and saved his head from going-&#xD;
like 'the spirit of the beast that per-&#xD;
isheth"-"downward." He disengaged&#xD;
himself from the creeping ligament, and&#xD;
abandoned the pursuit, concluding it&#xD;
would be fruitless, and-an unnecessary&#xD;
waste of time.  He turned his steps&#xD;
towards the highway, and chanced upon&#xD;
Gerald's fallen weapon. Hamilton took&#xD;
it up, and in utter astonishment, saw&#xD;
his own initials upon the shining silver&#xD;
plate. He had no doubt as to who was&#xD;
his assailant-the fact of his flying&#xD;
stamped him with-Gerald's known cow-&#xD;
ardice-but the letters divulged a deep-&#xD;
er plot than he had suspected. There&#xD;
was doubtless a fellow to the oie he&#xD;
held, and the engraver of the' initials&#xD;
could probably identify their owner. He&#xD;
would probe the matter to the bottom,&#xD;
and visit upon the monster the whole&#xD;
weight of the law.&#xD;
He placed the weapon in his pocket,&#xD;
and. turned towards Fairville in quest of&#xD;
his horse, which, fortunately, had been&#xD;
arrested by a pedestrian, who had&#xD;
mounted and was galloping back in&#xD;
search of the rider. Hamilton liberally&#xD;
rewarded the humble woodsman for the&#xD;
great service, and without alluding to&#xD;
his recent encountre, hurried off to&#xD;
&#xD;
Fairville. He had decided to keep the&#xD;
affair secret from all but his associate,&#xD;
to avoid alarming the foeand increasing&#xD;
Myrelda's solicitude, till proof sufficient&#xD;
could be obtained, to convict him of&#xD;
the crime. Could he have looked a&#xD;
little into the future, he would have&#xD;
pursued a far different course.&#xD;
On his return ro Arlingford, he was&#xD;
greeted with fraternal feeling by Charles&#xD;
Montford, who had arrived during his&#xD;
adsence ; and in the presence of her&#xD;
lover and brother, Myrelda forgot her&#xD;
late misery, and laughed at her idle&#xD;
fears, as Hamilton playfully plumped&#xD;
her head back upon his shoulder, and&#xD;
drew down his face in a die-away- ex-&#xD;
pression,. in nimiery of her morning's&#xD;
appearance.&#xD;
Had she known that but for her pre-&#xD;
sentiment, that noble and idolized form&#xD;
would then have been rigid and cold in&#xD;
its last long slumber, the wild rose would&#xD;
not have bloomed sweetly upon her round&#xD;
cheeks, nor the sparkles of pleasure&#xD;
floated and flashed in those lustrous&#xD;
brown eyes. Hamilton designed never&#xD;
to acquaint her with the diy's adven-&#xD;
ture, till his assailant was securely lodged&#xD;
where his life could not agonize her heart&#xD;
with fears for his own safety.&#xD;
Their marriage had been delayed in&#xD;
expectation of Charles' arrival; and&#xD;
now an early day was specified for the&#xD;
consummation. Hamilton intended to&#xD;
startle all Arlingford, by the brilliancy&#xD;
and pomp of Myrelda's bridal, celebrated&#xD;
in her childhood's home, before, pro-&#xD;
ceeding on a northward tour. Aunt&#xD;
Linder and Rose were snugly domicili-&#xD;
ated in their old quarters, which recon-&#xD;
ciled them, somewhat, to her anticipated&#xD;
absence of some months. Myrelda laid&#xD;
her head on the pillow that night, with&#xD;
a heart overflowing with gratitude and&#xD;
love to Him who had broughther through&#xD;

&#xD;
the dark shadows, of adversity, into the&#xD;
broad sunshine of earthly happiness.&#xD;
. The day subsequent to the events nar-&#xD;
rated, the city of Arlingford was agi-&#xD;
tated by the announcement of Dr. Ger-&#xD;
ald's mysterious .disappearance. Mrs.&#xD;
Gerald had fallen into hysterics, as the&#xD;
night wore on, and her husband came&#xD;
not, and a scouting party, organized by&#xD;
her brother, had gone in quest of the&#xD;
missing man.&#xD;
Hamilton experienced a strange sinka&#xD;
ing of the soul, as this intelligence was&#xD;
communicated at the Melville House,&#xD;
that he could not shake off. He half&#xD;
resolved to disclose the whole affair, and&#xD;
exp;ess his belief that Gerald had ab-&#xD;
sconded,.through fear of being appre-&#xD;
hended and brought to justThe; but a&#xD;
second thought decided him to await&#xD;
Mr. 3errien's return, and obtain his&#xD;
advice and co-operation. Gerald would&#xD;
doubtless, be forthcoming with a plausi-&#xD;
ble excuse for his delay, which would&#xD;
serve to screen him from suspicion, if&#xD;
the affair had been divulged. He re-&#xD;
lied upon the weapon in his possession,&#xD;
as the means of convicting his assailant.&#xD;
He would search the world over, if ne-&#xD;
cessary, to find the engraver of those&#xD;
initials. He awaited anxiously, further&#xD;
information concerning the matter, but&#xD;
the day closed, and still the scouting&#xD;
party had not returned.&#xD;
A cheerful group was gathered in Mr.&#xD;
Berrien's parlor that night, when the&#xD;
noble-hearted proprietor entered and&#xD;
grasped Charles Montford warmly by&#xD;
the hand, with a hearty slap of con-&#xD;
gratulation ,upon the shoulder. Charles&#xD;
had been absent two years, and in.&#xD;
listening to the recital of his adventures&#xD;
in the far West, the night flew swiftly&#xD;
and insensibly on. The iron tongue of&#xD;
the'city clock had long droned out upon&#xD;
the tranquil- night-waves the hour of'&#xD;
eleven, when, in answer to a nervous&#xD;
&#xD;
ring of the door bell, the stout Sheriff&#xD;
entered, followed by officers.Burley and&#xD;
Bragg, Gerald's brother-in-law  and&#xD;
Smith, and arrested Herbert Hamilton&#xD;
for the murder of Dr. Gerald I&#xD;
Hamilton sprang to his feet in aston-&#xD;
ishment and horror, while the late gay&#xD;
and joyous group grew livid with ex-&#xD;
itemenit.&#xD;
Myrelda clung to her lover's arm in&#xD;
mute agony, while her slender form&#xD;
shook like a leaf in an autumn blast. -&#xD;
Hamilton passed his arm around her&#xD;
tiny waist, and holding her securely to&#xD;
his breast, turned unflinchingly and&#xD;
firm as granite to the emissaries of the&#xD;
law.&#xD;
.  Is Dr. Gerald dead ?"&#xD;
Slie is, Sir," said the Sheriff, re-&#xD;
spectfully, as he observed Hamilton's&#xD;
loftly air. "His body, and that of his&#xD;
horse, were found shot and partially&#xD;
buried with these articles, apparently&#xD;
lost in the confusion of the moment."&#xD;
He produced a pistol-fellow to the one&#xD;
in Hamilton's possession-and a hand-&#xD;
kerchief bearing his name !&#xD;
Myrelda recognized the latter as her&#xD;
own gift, and turned her eyes, despair-&#xD;
ingly, upon her lover's firm face. He&#xD;
met her glance and asked half sternly:&#xD;
" Do you think me guilty of this&#xD;
crime, Myrelda ?"&#xD;
She read his heart in his tone and&#xD;
expression.&#xD;
"I do not, Sir." He smiled at the&#xD;
earnestness of her tone, as he turned&#xD;
again to the Sheriff.&#xD;
" I have too much respect for law to&#xD;
seek to elude it; but before I leave this&#xD;
house, allow me an explanation to those&#xD;
I leave within it."&#xD;
He related, in a calm, earnest tone,&#xD;
the whole story of the assult, and the&#xD;
why and wherefor of its concealment ;&#xD;
and raising his eyes, reverently, to&#xD;
heaven, he concl ded the revelation,-&#xD;

Mr. Wilmot testified to the unim-&#xD;
peachable .life of his foster son; and&#xD;
the old man's nervous excitement, and&#xD;
earnest solicitude would have stamped&#xD;
him as the culprit to an ignorant ob-.&#xD;
server.&#xD;
TheState's Attorney'sopeningspeech&#xD;
was followed by an energetic one from&#xD;
Mr. Berrien, the counsel for defense.&#xD;
He painted(Gerald's reputation in viv-&#xD;
id colors, his desertion of an affianced&#xD;
bride, from mercenary motives, his sub-&#xD;
sequent slanderous insinuations con--&#xD;
cerning her, to screen his own baseness,&#xD;
his unjustifiable animosity for her ac-&#xD;
knowleddlover, his wanton attempt&#xD;
upon ihat, lover's-life, the challenge and&#xD;
its declension,, had the prisoner yearn-&#xD;
ed forthe life of his adversary, he&#xD;
could have sent him into eternity with-&#xD;
out trouble or stratagem, and been con-&#xD;
sideredonorable, in the estimation of&#xD;
the world! :Was it unreasonable or un-&#xD;
natural to suppose that one so eager for&#xD;
the destruction of the prisoner as the&#xD;
deceased had evidenced himself to be,&#xD;
would not descend to the assassin's re-&#xD;
sort tocompass. his end, :when other&#xD;
means!had failed ? If Gerald's design&#xD;
was to obviate suspicion by murdering&#xD;
&#xD;
the prisoner with weapons bearing his&#xD;
own initials, would not so cunning a&#xD;
mind fold himself in a mantle of secre-&#xD;
ey, respecting all that pertained to so&#xD;
nefarious a plan ? Was it marvellous&#xD;
that he should not have bruited abroad&#xD;
his absence, when that absence was&#xD;
purposely designed to affect his scheme?&#xD;
Gerald's personnel so strongly resem-&#xD;
bled the prisoner's that a stranger might&#xD;
readily confound their individualities,&#xD;
under the circumstances. It was a well&#xD;
known fact, that the deceased had ever&#xD;
prided himself upon the feminine size&#xD;
and seeming of his hand, witnesses had&#xD;
testified to that truth."&#xD;
Mr. Wiley, the opposing counsel,&#xD;
succeeded Mr. Berrien.&#xD;
"If the prisoner at the Bar were&#xD;
guiltless of the crime alleged, who was&#xD;
the murderer of the deceased ? Did&#xD;
suspicion rest upon an ther enemy who&#xD;
could devise so perfect a plot for the&#xD;
prisoner's destruction ? The arraigned&#xD;
had acknowledged the assault of the&#xD;
deceased, upon the highway, and his&#xD;
cowardly flight., Who would believe&#xD;
that an ambushed enemy would fly,&#xD;
without a third shot at a prostrate foe ?&#xD;
and who would believe the prisoner at&#xD;
the Bar so brave as to face a hidden&#xD;
assailant, a broad target for a secret&#xD;
weapon, when a frantic steed would&#xD;
have carried him   swiftly, beyond its&#xD;
deadly power? It were far more reas-&#xD;
onable to believe that the loss of the&#xD;
weapon and handkerchief, in the hurry&#xD;
and confusion of secreting the. murder-&#xD;
ed -body, originated the whole story&#xD;
of the assault. Had the prisoner been&#xD;
granted sufficient time to regain the'lost&#xD;
articles, the deceased would doubtless&#xD;
, have been borne from     his coffinles&#xD;

ing Charles, with   such  deep soul.&#xD;
suffering depicted upon his livid face&#xD;
and contracted brow, that the grim and&#xD;
hardened sheriff joined in the concert&#xD;
of sounds that filled the dreary prison.&#xD;
" Charles, my brother, this is worse&#xD;
than death!1"  Hamilton clasped them&#xD;
both in his arms, as he spoke, and laid&#xD;
his face upon Myrelda's.  -    .&#xD;
"'Never leave her or consign her to&#xD;

Mr. Berrien's shoulder, with a fervent&#xD;
" God bless you I" and went forth into&#xD;
the free air of heaven; from which he&#xD;
had been so long shut out, for another's&#xD;

OR, THE BAS BLEU.&#xD;
&#xD;
HERBE-RT HAMILTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
A loud report and savage yell echoed'&#xD;
behind the speaker, and Hamilton&#xD;
turned, involuntarily, at thesound. It&#xD;
was crazy Joe; he had landed, with one&#xD;
tremendous bound, from among the&#xD;
spectators, upon the platform; his great&#xD;
blue eyes rolling in 'fine frenzy,' and&#xD;
brown hand flourishing a most formi-&#xD;
dable-looking knife.&#xD;
"I'll stick it in the dratted Sherifff&#xD;
clean up to the handle, ef he dares to&#xD;
tech Hamilton-dog me !'' roared Joe,&#xD;
flourishing the glittering knife around-&#xD;
his headwith the look of' an escaped&#xD;
lunatic.&#xD;
The grieved Sheriff smiled sadly, at&#xD;
this effervescence of affection from the&#xD;
half-witted for the doomed man, while&#xD;
tears sprang to the eyes of the prisoner&#xD;
at the demonstration.&#xD;
Officer Bragg crept stealthily behind&#xD;
the furious youth, and  wresting the&#xD;
knife from hisclutching fingers, pinioned&#xD;
hin securely, and was bearing him from&#xD;
the platform, kicking and yelling fran-&#xD;
tically, when Hamilton stepped forward&#xD;
and graspedhis hand with a last farewell.&#xD;
" God bless you, Joseph, we shall&#xD;
meet again; be her friend, when I am&#xD;
gone."&#xD;
Great tears were rolling from Joe's&#xD;
eyes, as he found himself incapable of&#xD;
aiding his friend, and he sobbed out&#xD;
between a shriek and a groan:&#xD;
"I will so!-oh Lord !--I will so! ef&#xD;
I don't, dog me!"&#xD;
Joe plunged and howled in his des-&#xD;
perate efforts to escape from his captor;&#xD;
and the memory of the dim and dreary&#xD;
prison, with which he was threatened,&#xD;
alone silenced his obstreperousness; but&#xD;
he dropped down at the feet of the offi-&#xD;
cer, and sobbed like a whipped child,&#xD;
upon the bare ground.   -&#xD;
Hamilton crushed down his emotion,&#xD;
with a strong effort of his extraordinary&#xD;
will, and proceeded with his address.&#xD;
&#xD;
Suddenly the Sheriff's hand was laid&#xD;
heavily upon his shoulder; while his&#xD;
white face and starting eyes betrayed&#xD;
the most intense excitement. Hamil-&#xD;
ton's eyes followed his wild, eager gaze,&#xD;
and far away, down the broad opening,&#xD;
two horsemen were observed straining&#xD;
over the smooth way with waiving hats,&#xD;
and a shout was borne through the dis-&#xD;
tance, to the acute senses of the eager&#xD;
listeners.&#xD;
Nearer and still nearer they flew,&#xD;
Hamilton turned and looked at the&#xD;
Sheriff, who had lifted the other hand&#xD;
to his. shoulder and leaned nervously&#xD;
upon his prisoner, forgetful of their re-&#xD;
lative positions. Hamilton stood like a&#xD;
marble statue, firm and cold to the last&#xD;
degree, while the stout Sheriff trembled&#xD;
with joyful anticipation.&#xD;
The attention of the crowd was now&#xD;
directed to the shouting and flying horse-&#xD;
men, and Mr. Berrien was recognized,&#xD;
hatless and bloody, in advance of Dr.&#xD;
Elwood. Mr. Berrien had dropped his&#xD;
hat, in mortal terror, as he ssaw from&#xD;
afar the Sheriff's movements about his,&#xD;
friend, and strained his lungs to arrest&#xD;
attention, before the fttal deed was done.&#xD;
He saw he was perceived, as he came&#xD;
nearer, and lashing his foaming steed,&#xD;
he gave a last and glorious yell, that&#xD;
was caught up and prolonged by Dr.&#xD;
Elwood: "hurra-a-a ! hurra-a-a-a !" and&#xD;
shot forward. He tumbled headlong&#xD;
from his horse, and leaped upon the&#xD;
elevation.&#xD;
"The murderer is found ! Hamilton is&#xD;
free !''  The good man and faithful&#xD;
friend fell exhausted and breathless&#xD;
upon the platform, with his associate's&#xD;
arms around him !&#xD;
A shout went up from the immense&#xD;
and excited crowd, that tore through the&#xD;
air like live thunder !&#xD;
The Sheriff burst into tears, and&#xD;
hugged his late prisoner right heartily&#xD;
&#xD;
-round the neck, as Dr. Elwood pro-&#xD;
duced the watch, and made a short and&#xD;
hurried revelation.  ilamilion stood&#xD;
like one entranced, during the explana-&#xD;
tion; he appeared rooted to the spot, ii-&#xD;
capable of language or action.  Pres-&#xD;
ently his fine form expanded gloriously,&#xD;
the rich blood surged over his radiant&#xD;
face, add his lustrous black eyes turned&#xD;
smilingly heavenward.&#xD;
"g4wife-thank God !" He tottered&#xD;
forward, and leaned a moment upon Mr.&#xD;
Berrier's shoulder; then leaping from&#xD;
the plaifori with a mighty bound; he&#xD;
fled towards his associate's residence,&#xD;
with the uproarious rejoicings of the&#xD;
immen e crowd following him, in peals&#xD;
of thunder from iron-like lungs, that&#xD;
tore up the blue atmosphere far and wide.&#xD;
Joe reared-and plunged among the,&#xD;
crowd, like one possessed as he compre-&#xD;
hended the matter, and.his bran new&#xD;
hat, presented by Hamilton, was seen&#xD;
making an aerial tour, a little previous&#xD;
to being "squat up" by the thousand of&#xD;
trampling feet. He leaped upon the&#xD;
back of officer Bragg, and hugging him&#xD;
around the neck, well nigh to strangula-&#xD;
tion, with unutterable joy, poor Joe&#xD;
roared like a young lion !&#xD;
The city clock rang out the hour of&#xD;
twelve, as the late prisoner sprang up&#xD;
the steps of Myrelda's temporary home;&#xD;
Mr. Berrien's watch was ten minutes too&#xD;
fast,&#xD;
The servant uttered a scream of su-&#xD;
perstitious fright, as she admitted him.&#xD;
He caught her tightly by the arm.&#xD;
" Silence !--don't fear; I am free-&#xD;
how is Myrelda ?"&#xD;
The girl quivered and sobbed :&#xD;
" She ain't got over her fit yet ! Oh!&#xD;
mars Ham'lton, dey say she won't live!"&#xD;
Hamilton reeled and fell against the&#xD;
wall.&#xD;
" Go and send Dr. Merton here,&#xD;
Fanny-quick !"&#xD;
&#xD;
The negress fled up the stairs in a.&#xD;
twinkling; she thought he was dying too!&#xD;
Dr. Merton sprang.forward, and threw&#xD;
his aged arms around Hamilton's neck,&#xD;
as he hurriedly entered the parlor.&#xD;
" Thank God !'for His mercy eudur-&#xD;
eth forever.'" Hamilton's shoulder was&#xD;
wet with his tears.&#xD;
" Tell me there is hope!" The agonized&#xD;
husband fixed his flashing eyes upon the&#xD;
old man, while his fingers tightened&#xD;
vice-like around his arm.&#xD;
"While there is life there is hope;&#xD;
if she can be made sensible of your es-&#xD;
cape, she will live; but we must act with&#xD;
.caution, a sudden revulsion might des-&#xD;
troy her:"&#xD;
Hamilton followed him up the stairs,&#xD;
and softly entered his wife's chamber.&#xD;
He caught Dr. Merton's arm, with an.&#xD;
expression of utter despair upon his&#xD;
countenance, as he beheld her face ; it&#xD;
was rigid and cold, as though the last&#xD;
spark had gone out. He gathered her&#xD;
to his breast, with a tender fondness&#xD;
that drew tears from all eyes. He had&#xD;
thought never to hold that frail form to&#xD;
his bosom again; and now that he was&#xD;
free, to see her perish from his arms,&#xD;
upon the very brink of earthly happi-&#xD;
ness, and leave him alone in the world,&#xD;
would be insupportable. He breathed&#xD;
her name in softest accents, and kissed&#xD;
her pale lips repeatedly; but her ear was&#xD;
dead to the sound of his voice, and no&#xD;
glad flush of recognition rippled over&#xD;
her cold, white face.&#xD;
The day wore tediously on, and Ham-&#xD;
ilton sat beside her, no less white and&#xD;
rigid than the face upon which his&#xD;
strangely-lit eyes were riveted.  No&#xD;
sound of sorrow or startled exclamation&#xD;
had escaped his lips; yet those who&#xD;
looked into the fathomless depths of&#xD;
those restles, introverted eyes, knew the&#xD;
deep throes of the strong heart beneath&#xD;
them.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
Revenge, at first though sweet,&#xD;
Bitter, ere long, back on itself recols.-4n1LToN.&#xD;
Henry Greenwood was the only son&#xD;
of a father who had obtained his wealth&#xD;
by what is termed "foul means," that is&#xD;
by imposing upon a dying relative, who&#xD;
was non conmpos mentis; which wealth&#xD;
was subsequently -wrested from his son,&#xD;
by the - rightful heir, Mr. Edwards,&#xD;
through the agency of Herbert Hamil-&#xD;
ton's superior powers.&#xD;
Mr. Greenwood, senior, was an un-&#xD;
principled man, and trained up his son&#xD;
to "follow in the footsteps of his illus-&#xD;
trious predecessor;" and the race-ground&#xD;
gambling saloon, and rumseller, were&#xD;
well patronized by both father and son,&#xD;
while the amiable and pious wife and&#xD;
mother, wept over the downward ten-&#xD;
dency of those most dear to her heart&#xD;
on earth.&#xD;
Mr. Greenwood, senior, died of mania&#xD;
a potu, a few months previous to Ham-&#xD;
ilton's advent in Arlingford, and the&#xD;
result of the suit instituted by Mr. Ed-&#xD;
wards, made the counsel a vindictive,&#xD;
but secret enemy in the defeated and&#xD;
abandoned son. This fact induced Mr.&#xD;
Berrien to challenge him on the occa-&#xD;
sion of Hamilton's trial; for though dis-&#xD;
creet and courteous to the talented and&#xD;
popular man, the lynx eye of Mr. Ber-&#xD;
rien detected more in the countenance&#xD;
of Greenwood, than his unsuspecting&#xD;
associate had ever sought for.&#xD;
&#xD;
Greenwood saw the look of surprise&#xD;
that Hamilton gave Berrien, at the time&#xD;
of his rejection, which rendered him&#xD;
more sensitive during the trial, and&#xD;
completely unmanned him, when, in&#xD;
sweeping over the crowd, the prisoner's&#xD;
eyes rested upon him. He hated Ham-&#xD;
ilton, and yearned for revenge, but saw&#xD;
-the better part of valor was discretion."&#xD;
He soon perceived Gerald's animosity,&#xD;
and watched him narrowly, hoping&#xD;
through him, to satiate his thirst for&#xD;
vengeance. He longed to form a league&#xD;
with him against Hamilton, for the de-&#xD;
struction of his hated rival's reputation&#xD;
and by getting Gerald within his power,&#xD;
supply his pecuniary wants from the&#xD;
Dr's. purse, and at the same time, grat-&#xD;
ify his yearning for revenge; but Gerald&#xD;
was not to be entrapped into a conspiracy.&#xD;
He concealed, as far as in him lay, his&#xD;
bitter enmity for Hamilton-which was&#xD;
an ineffectual effort of his fiery and&#xD;
passionate nature-to obviate " suspicion&#xD;
when his murderous plan was executed.&#xD;
Greenwood was present at the Melville&#xD;
House, the night of Hamilton's return&#xD;
to Arlingford, and witnessed the Dr's.&#xD;
humiliation; and was his victor at the&#xD;
gambling saloon. He passed Gerald's&#xD;
residence, as the intoxicated and furious&#xD;
Dr. emerged therefrom, and surreptiti&#xD;
ously followed in his wake. He saw&#xD;
the firing of the building, and readily&#xD;
comprehended the design; it was the&#xD;
same that he yearned for--revenge !&#xD;
Gerald's disguise did not availhim--&#xD;
at last he had the blood-thirsty Doctor&#xD;
within his power !  He awaited the&#xD;
victim's return to the front yard, to dis-&#xD;
close his knowledge of his felony, but&#xD;
Gerald suddenly disappeared behind the&#xD;
rear building, and made good his escape&#xD;
ere Greenwood became fully satisfied of&#xD;
the fact.&#xD;
Henry Greenwood would not have&#xD;
perpetrated cold blooded murder; but&#xD;

OR, THE BAS BLEU.             121&#xD;
&#xD;
120              HIERBERT HAMILTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
he permitted the burning of the build-&#xD;
ing, through hatred for Hamilton. Ils&#xD;
hand had not ignited the match, and he&#xD;
comforted himself with this reflection,&#xD;
as he witnessed the after horror.  It&#xD;
would be in vain to inform Gerald of his&#xD;
knowledge now; he would deny the&#xD;
charge, and there was no proof, and be-&#xD;
sides to give publicity to the matter,&#xD;
would but implicate himself, and open&#xD;
up a gulf between him and his intended&#xD;
victim.&#xD;
Greenwood kept quiet, but followed&#xD;
'Gerald more closely, and watched his&#xD;
expression narrowly, in the presence of&#xD;
Hamilton. He saw the flash of the Doc-&#xD;
tor's eye, as his despised rival's visit to&#xD;
Fairville, was announced, and formed his&#xD;
plan accordingly.,- He felt confident,&#xD;
that the murder of the lover was the&#xD;
villain's aim, since his' attempt upon&#xD;
Myrelda's life was defeated.&#xD;
Gerald passed him, in the.disguise of&#xD;
a decrepit old man, mounted upon a&#xD;
mule, as he preceded Hamilton upon the&#xD;
road to Fairville. Like Peter, Green-&#xD;
wood ,followed him "a long way off," and&#xD;
saw him enter the woods, unperceived&#xD;
by him. He cautiously secured his vie-&#xD;
-       .4im's horse, to prevent his escape, and&#xD;
clambering up a lofty monarch of the&#xD;
woods, awaited the result. He presented&#xD;
himself to the terrified Gerald, as he&#xD;
came forth from his hiding place, and&#xD;
made proposals which the guilty man,&#xD;
inhis awful strait acceeded to,  The&#xD;
sum of-one thousand dollars was to be&#xD;
the "hush money". for the present, with&#xD;
future disbursements at Greegwood's&#xD;
command.&#xD;
Gerald suddenly became- very com-&#xD;
municative, and confidential. He con-&#xD;
fessed his incendiarism, and displayed&#xD;
the: weapon as a proof of his satisfaction&#xD;
and confidence in his new ally; but as&#xD;
Greenwood's eyes were bent upon the&#xD;
initials, a dagger flashed from the Doc-&#xD;
&#xD;
tor's breast, and struck against a half&#xD;
dollar in his vest, with a forcethat sent&#xD;
him reeling backwards. He dodged&#xD;
the second blow and aiming the weapon&#xD;
he held, fired. Thus, the weapon bear-&#xD;
ing his rival's initials, and which was&#xD;
designed for his destruction, sent the&#xD;
would-be-assassin, in the morning of his&#xD;
years, into the presence of an offended&#xD;
God; verifying the proverb: "who so&#xD;
rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him."&#xD;
Greenwood was confounded, as he&#xD;
saw himself a murderer, but the Arch&#xD;
Enemy whispered, he might now have&#xD;
his revenge. He shot the Doctor's horse&#xD;
and partially buried the two bodies, and&#xD;
tossed the weapon in :the tangled wild;&#xD;
he was not aware that it had a fellow.&#xD;
He readily joined the scouting party,&#xD;
and was the discoverer of the lost pistol.&#xD;
The handkerchief was subsequently&#xD;
found by Gerald's brother-in-law, 'it&#xD;
having been lost during Hamilton's race&#xD;
after his secret foe, and not perceived&#xD;
until his arrival at Fairville; and as he&#xD;
returned to Arlingford with Mr. Day..&#xD;
ton, he could not tarry to recover it,&#xD;
without betraying the secret which he&#xD;
designed to preserve for a time, from&#xD;
all but his associate.&#xD;
Upon the commitment of 'Hamilton,&#xD;
arid his final sentence, Greenwood's hate&#xD;
was superseded by remorse, which de-&#xD;
ranged his mind, as the day of execu-&#xD;
tion drew nearer, and forced him, at&#xD;
last, to a confession,&#xD;
A few days subsequent to his entire&#xD;
restoration to reason, Greenwood was&#xD;
visited by Hamilton and his blooming&#xD;
bride. The guilty man buried his pale&#xD;
face in the pillow, in deep humiliation,&#xD;
at his approach; but the kind voice of&#xD;
the noble man whom he had "hated&#xD;
without a cause," restored him to self-&#xD;
possession; and laying his sickly, wasted&#xD;
hand in his, with a sudden impulse. he&#xD;
exclaimed, with a gush of penitential&#xD;
tears:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Forgive me, Mr. Hamilton !"&#xD;
Herbert Hamilton did forgive, as his&#xD;
subsequent care and kindness to the re-&#xD;
formed man, and his estimable mother&#xD;
evidenced.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
"Love is the fulling of the law, God is Love."&#xD;
Fourteen months had passed, since&#xD;
the events narrated in the last chapter,&#xD;
and Myreldra Hamilton sat in an elegant&#xD;
NewEngland home, twisting the short&#xD;
jetty curls of a black-eyed baby boy&#xD;
around her small, taper finger, when her&#xD;
husband entered the apartment, bearing&#xD;
a sealed letter.&#xD;
The old flush of love and gladness&#xD;
rippled up to her round cheeks, before&#xD;
the smiling glance of Herbert Hamil-&#xD;
ton, as she went forward, with assumed&#xD;
stateliness, and bowed dignifiedly to the-&#xD;
majestic form before her, whose deep,&#xD;
dark eyes flashed with humor, while his&#xD;
firm, manly face was scrupulously sober.&#xD;
" My. dear Sir, I am most happy to&#xD;
find myself again in your immediate&#xD;
presence, after an everlasting age of ten&#xD;
minutes' absence, and respectfully re-&#xD;
quest that you will forthwith 'render&#xD;
unto Cesar, the thing that is Caesar's.""&#xD;
She peeped archly around at the letter&#xD;
behind him.&#xD;
Hamilton brought his hands behind&#xD;
her, with a laughing squeeze, and&#xD;
smack of her red upturned mouth, like&#xD;
the report of a Christmas cracker, and&#xD;
gently snubbled her nose with the edge&#xD;
of the letter, ere he exchanged it for&#xD;
his crowing baby, whose light drapery&#xD;
fluttered musically in the breeze, as it&#xD;
came down from an upward toss, with a&#xD;
chirruping catch of the breath, and&#xD;
grabbed at its father's black rings of&#xD;
hair, with its tiny, fat- hand, which&#xD;
elicited a facetiously frowning : "hello !&#xD;
&#xD;
o-u-e-h !" from its delighted paternal re-&#xD;
lative.&#xD;
Myrelda read Charles' letter aloud,&#xD;
which occasioned.no little surprise and&#xD;
pleasure, in the heart of both husband&#xD;
and wife. It ran :&#xD;
"'The melancholy days have come,&#xD;
The saddest of the year,'&#xD;
to quote the language of that sweet but&#xD;
mistaken poet, Bryant.&#xD;
" The September winds go by with a&#xD;
lullaby sound, which to a sorrowful heart&#xD;
might seem a moan of anguish; and the&#xD;
faint-hued blossoms are shutting up their&#xD;
blue eyes in a peaceful death-slumber,&#xD;
down by the garden wall, and off in the&#xD;
woodland nooks ; the gold and crimson&#xD;
leaves are rustling along the hazy ways,&#xD;
and over the smoky rills, with low and&#xD;
pensive sound, telling a tale of change&#xD;
and.decay; but within my heart, sweet&#xD;
sis, blooms a world of freshest verdure&#xD;
just bursting into beauty and fragrance,&#xD;
for the bridal day of your brother is&#xD;
near at hand, and you and yours are&#xD;

your lovely summer home, four weeks&#xD;
ago, I did not tell you that love for her,&#xD;
who is now my betrothed bride, drew&#xD;
me irresistibly to a warmer atmosphere&#xD;
than floated-within your mountain clime.&#xD;
" Three years agone, I resolved never&#xD;
to reveal my heart to you, until I had&#xD;
the assurance of a reciprocity of feel-&#xD;

boyhood-my gentle blue-eyed Mabel&#xD;
Clyde. But for our fallen fortunes, I&#xD;
should have addressed her sooner; but I&#xD;
feared her proud father, and trusted to&#xD;
time and the symptoms of affection I&#xD;
detected in her to realize my hopes.&#xD;

down beneath the cold surface of high&#xD;
station and pecuniary power, and my&#xD;
Mabel looks hopefully to the time when&#xD;
the little leaven in his proud nature,&#xD;
will 'leaven the whole lump.' Mr. Clyde&#xD;
esteems it an honor to bestow his&#xD;
daughter upon the brother-in-law of&#xD;
Herbert Hnmilton.&#xD;
" Last week, Lora eloped with that&#xD;
dissolute youth, Lorenzo Lee, to whom&#xD;
her father objected, on the ground of&#xD;
his principles, despite his wealth. Her&#xD;
unfilial conduct has cast a gloom be-&#xD;
neath the parental roof, and Mr. Clyde&#xD;
turns more thoughtfully and humbly, to&#xD;
his christian child, iny pure-hearted,&#xD;
meek Mabel, for comfort and companion-&#xD;
ship.&#xD;
" Mrs. herald, it is rumored, will ere&#xD;
long become the wife of Augustus Smith&#xD;
through the magnetism of her many&#xD;
golden charms. Imtaet her at Cape May&#xD;
on my return South-a gay and dash-&#xD;
ing widow, blooming in the brightness&#xD;
of art, and surrounded by a bevy of&#xD;
butterflies of fashion, who bask in the&#xD;
rays of fortune, and court alone its&#xD;
favorites, the most conspicuous of whom&#xD;
was her bridegroom elect. I venture to&#xD;
predict \for her a happier future than&#xD;
her wedded past, even with, such a man&#xD;
as Augustus Smith ! I would not say&#xD;
more of the dead.&#xD;
" Henry Greenwood continues tem-&#xD;
perate and industrious, and gladdens&#xD;
the heart of his amiable and pious&#xD;
.mother by his steady and onward course.&#xD;
In him is verified the scriptural passage:&#xD;
'through fear, men depart from iniquity.'&#xD;
He is now my head clerk, and gives&#xD;
high promise of a prosperous and hon-&#xD;
orable future. He reveres the name of&#xD;
him whom he once hated and most&#xD;
wronged-the forgiving and munificent&#xD;
Herbert Hamilton.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The improvements at the Vale are&#xD;
now perfected, and the new and hand-&#xD;
some mansion will be illuminated (deo&#xD;
vo lente) the 18th, for the reception of&#xD;
my loved and loving bride. We re-&#xD;
pudiate the modern style of absconding&#xD;
from church, on a bridal tour, and mean&#xD;
to make our marriage a blessing to the&#xD;
lovers of dainties and amusements, as&#xD;
well as ourselves-especially 'the poor,&#xD;
the maimed, the halt and the b lind'-&#xD;
by keeping up the festivities for a season.&#xD;
"I'm tired of bachelor life, in this&#xD;
great old mansion, with none but Aunt&#xD;
Linder and Rose,iand the cat that Her-&#xD;
bert proposed to 'kick down stairs quick-&#xD;
er than lightning, for presuming to kiss&#xD;
the cheek that belonged to hirn,' for&#xD;
company ; and I beg you will hasten&#xD;
like summer birds, from the keen moun-&#xD;
tain air of that New England home, to&#xD;
a warmer and sunnier clime."&#xD;
Myrelda laid her head back on Ham-&#xD;
ilton's shoulder, and laughed merrily&#xD;
over the quotation in Charles' letter,&#xD;
while his large black eyes sparkled down&#xD;
in her rosy upturned face, and the baby&#xD;
squirmed and crowed at the inspiring&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
Charles had relieved the widow Ger-&#xD;
ald of her husband's malicious purchase&#xD;
and fitted it up for the future home of&#xD;
sweet Mabel Clyde, who entered it soon&#xD;
after Myrelda's return to Arlingford, as&#xD;
Mrs. Charles Montford.&#xD;
Mr. Berrien prosecuted Bushman and&#xD;
Lynch for perjury-recovered the five&#xD;
thousand dollars paid by Hamilton for&#xD;
being condemned to die by their testi-&#xD;
mony ; and the old judge who presided&#xD;
at Hamilton's trial sentenced them to&#xD;
five year's imprisonment in the peni-&#xD;
tentiary, as a warning to others of like&#xD;
ilk.&#xD;
" Haw ! haw I" roared crazy"Joe, as&#xD;
he took the plump and sputtering heir&#xD;
of Maple Hall-Myrelda's early home&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE BAS BLEU.                         123&#xD;
-in his awkward arms, and looked up Herbert Hamilton, Myrelda Montford,&#xD;
at the laughing parents, and Mr. Ber- the Bas Bleu, wandered through Violet&#xD;
rien-"ef this ere feller ain't 'nother Vale, leaning upon his protecting arm,&#xD;
Herbert Hamilton clean through, yer a blooming wife and mother-the dark-&#xD;
kin take ' y hat, an' I'll stick to 'em ness all passed, and the light of love&#xD;
like a dog to a root-dog me!"      and happiness shining sweetly around&#xD;
Two years from her first meeting with them.&#xD;
