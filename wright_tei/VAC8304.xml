The unfortunate young lady whose history we are about to write&#xD;
was' the only daughter of one of the "Merchant Princes," of New&#xD;
York. Her father, Jacob Fosbenner, was a man of German extraction,&#xD;
very rich and liberal in some respects, but in the way of business, ex-&#xD;
tremely "close," exacting the last cent from his debtors, and paying&#xD;
all his own liabilities with the punctuality of clock-work. His only&#xD;
daughter Adeline, and his only son Frederick, were educated in the&#xD;
best manner, according to the American standard of education, and&#xD;
their natural talents were far above mediocrity. Adeline, especially&#xD;
was an object of general admiration, on account of her mental gifts,&#xD;
her many accomplishments, her amiable disposition, and her large&#xD;
fortune. .The last named advantage probably gave additional lustre to&#xD;
all the others.&#xD;
In order to make this narrative easily understood, it is necessary to&#xD;
explain that Mr. Fosbenner's exact business habits were carried into his&#xD;
domestic concerns. He allowed a certain sum for every family expense;&#xD;
so much for provisions, so much for fuel, so much for clothing, etc.&#xD;
Each of these allowances was quite sufficient for the specified purpose;&#xD;
more, indeed, than was absolutely required to keep up the elegant style&#xD;
of living in which the family indulged-but on no account would the&#xD;
old merchant permit the expenses which he so handsomely provided for&#xD;
to be exceeded by a single dollar. Such was his humor, and it is a&#xD;
strange circumstance, that this peculiarity of the old gentleman caused&#xD;
all the trouble we are about to relate.&#xD;
The sum which Mr. Fosbenner allowed Adeline for the purposes of&#xD;
dressing, was no less than fifteen hundred dollars per annum, and she&#xD;
easily contrived to spend that amount in dry-goods stores, milliners,&#xD;

mantuamakers and jewellers; indeed her taste, in this particular was&#xD;
somewhat extravagant. Her pyirchasea were so large and frequent, and&#xD;
her. bonnets,, shawls, mantillas, etc., were changed so often, to conform&#xD;
with the variations of fashion, that the sum supplied for her wardrobe&#xD;
expenses was often exhausted, leaving her without many articles of&#xD;
dress or ornament which she earnestly desired to have, and it was very&#xD;
seldom that she was quite satisfied with her equipments.&#xD;
At times, therefore, she was discontented and unhappy, complaining,&#xD;
like FloraMcFIlimsey, that she had "nothing to wear," and believing&#xD;
that tie restrictions which hyr father had placed on her inclinations for&#xD;
dress were niggardly and tyrannical, although the sum which he had&#xD;
appropriated for that use was more than would be required for the&#xD;
maintenance of a respectable family.&#xD;
Yet Adeline possessed an excellent heart and a good understanding;&#xD;
she was benevolent and charitable in the highest.degree--her faults were&#xD;
the effects of improper training. She had been taught from her infancy&#xD;
that to follow the fashions was a necessity of her being. 11cr mother&#xD;
had pursued the same course, and on her death-bed had exhorted the&#xD;
weeping girl to persevere in the effort to become a leader of the beau&#xD;
monie, which had always been the high st object of her own ambition.&#xD;
Such was the last advice of the dying parent, and Adeline promised&#xD;
to obey the counsel; we need scarcely add that she religiously fulfilled&#xD;
that promise, while she had the opportunity to do so, but circumstance&#xD;
soon placed it out of her power to obey the injunction of her departed&#xD;
parent.&#xD;
Adeline was in her sixteenth year when she lost this exemplary&#xD;
mother. It was inithe autumn of 1860, about two years after that&#xD;
melancholy event, that the4 fashionable circles of New York were&#xD;
thrown into a state of fermentation, on account of a splendid fancy ball&#xD;
which was soon to take place, and at which all the monied magnificence'&#xD;
of the city was expected to be present.&#xD;
At this very juncture, Adeline, to her great dismay, found that her.&#xD;
wardrobe fund had been sadly diminished, and that the residue would&#xD;
hardly enable her to make that dazzling appearance at the gay festival&#xD;
which her position in the social circle seemed to retire.  This d&#xD;
-was terribly afflicting to her; she was compelled to make her purcovesy&#xD;
for the occasion with some regard to economy&amp;amp;.ubt very soon her ls&#xD;
dollar was expended, arnd by a strange oversight, she had neglected to&#xD;
provide herself with a suitable pair of gloves. The remembrance of&#xD;
this want occurred to her while~she was yet in the store where she had&#xD;
sought several articles and laid down the last piece of her money.&#xD;

What was she to do ?  The gloves must be had--but how were they&#xD;
to be obtained ? Many persons would have solved this difficulty by&#xD;
resolving to borrow some cash or to purchase the goods on credit.&#xD;
Adeline was shut out from both of .these expedients. - Her father had&#xD;
taught her that borrowing was a beggarly practice, and almost as dis-&#xD;
graceful as stealing, aid the credit system was equally an object of his&#xD;
detestation. Adeline, from her knowledge of his character and senti-&#xD;
ments, had every reason to believe that her father would be very much&#xD;
incensed if she should use either method to supply herself with the article&#xD;
wanted.&#xD;
While these thoughts were revolving in her mind, a lady entered the&#xD;
store and requested to be shown some white kid gloves of the finest&#xD;
quality. A package of such gloves was placed on the counter by one&#xD;
of the salesmen, and opened for the lady's inspection; having purchased&#xD;
a pair, she departed, and the shopnman being called away to a distant&#xD;
part of the store, the gloves were left open on the counter.&#xD;
Before we describe what followed, which may seem incredible to&#xD;
many who have an imperfect acquaintance with human nature in its&#xD;
various phases, let us consider all the circumstances of this extraordinary&#xD;
case, and the constitutional peculiarities of'Adeline Fosbenner. In her&#xD;
ordinary mood, she was perfectly honest, and few persons would be-&#xD;
more unlikely to commit an unlawful act, even under, the strongest&#xD;
temptation. But Adeline was one of those-strange mortals who often&#xD;
do things totally inconsistent with their general character, so that their&#xD;
most intimate friends are frequently at a loss to account for some part.&#xD;
of their conduct. Indeed, there are persons of this sort, who are often&#xD;
unable to account for their own actions, and who believe that they are&#xD;
controlled by some influence, which is totally independent of their own&#xD;
will. Such "impressible" persons sometimes, without any apparent&#xD;
motive, commit deeds, at the recollection of which, they are shocked&#xD;
and horrified during the remainder of their lives. This is not the-&#xD;
effect of spiritual or demoniac possession, as some people imagine, may&#xD;
result from disordered mental action, or a species of partial or temporary&#xD;
insanity, causing impulses, which cannot be resisted.  Tnder some&#xD;
such influence, a young man who was watching the motions of a forge-&#xD;
hammer, was impelled to place his hand under the ponderous instr-&#xD;
ment, and the consequence was that he was maimed foie. hvn&#xD;
thus endeavored to account for the fact we are about to relate, we will&#xD;
proceed with the narrative.&#xD;
The package of gloves, as we sai, was left open on the counter, and&#xD;
the salesmen were engaged in sttiendink to~ customers in differe-en part&amp;amp;&#xD;

had better' not try. If you don't hear what I have to say, you'll&#xD;
have to listen to a police officer, and that may be still worse for you.&#xD;
'Turn down Varick Street, and I'll follow you."&#xD;
She gladly turned out of the public thoroughfare into the more&#xD;
retired street pointed out by her persecutor. Within a few minutes, he&#xD;
was again at her side. The 'whole deformity and repulsiveness of bis&#xD;
figure and countenance, were now displayed to her observation. lie&#xD;
was a short, square-built man, with very round shQuld ers, long arms&#xD;
and bandy legs; his face was' seamed with -scars anderstudded with&#xD;
pimples ; his dress was coarse and badly fitted,.and he addressed Addino&#xD;
with a rude familiarity, which shocked her still more than his general&#xD;
appearance, although that was inexpressible disgusting.&#xD;
"That wts done pretty well,"'said he, as soon as le overtook her,&#xD;
"but I can larn you how to do it still better. You'll make afirst-rate&#xD;
prig with a little training."&#xD;
"I,--I don't understand you, said Adeline trembling and averting&#xD;
her eyes, "you must be mistaken in the person."&#xD;
" Not a bit of it," said the ruffian, "I reckon Isaw you hook them&#xD;
gloves. You thought I was looking another way, eh, my girl ?  That's&#xD;
the beauty of having a good squint. When you think I'm looking due&#xD;
north, I can see all that's going on at south-west. I'm a lucky feller,&#xD;
Iam, to have that nateral gift."            y/r,&#xD;
"You are mistaken," said Adeline, but with faltering accents, "I am&#xD;
not what you take me for."&#xD;
" Why Miss, I take you for a thief, and I can prove that you are&#xD;
one, for the very gloves you prigged are now in that 'ere pocket. No&#xD;
use of denying it you see, but I don't wish to spile your trade, for I'm&#xD;
in the same line myself, and I want you to come to my 'cdemor&#xD;
larn to operate in a better style. You can make lots of moneyify a&#xD;
choose, and all I ax, is for you to give me a sheer of the proceeds."&#xD;
"I do not wish to make money in that way," said Adeline sorrow-&#xD;
?ully, "I have money enough, and will give you fifty dollars if you will&#xD;
'leave me instantly and promise never-tojspeak to me again."&#xD;
" Where's the cash Miss; I'll promise to obleege you, though I think&#xD;
it's a pity that we can't keep up our acquaintance and work toget&#xD;
But for them fifty dollars Miss, I'll agree to your conditions.'g" r.&#xD;
Adeline nlow remembered that she had no money to giv him  sh&#xD;
stood silent and embarrassed, considering how she mihtsatin; sh&#xD;
demands and extricate herself from his power. emgtstsyhs&#xD;

"Podh! I can't be fooled in that way;" said the man, "there is any&#xD;
quantity of them shining articles selling in Chatham Street for twenty-&#xD;
five cents apiece. I must have better security than that.'&#xD;
"I will meet you here again to-morrow and bring the moniy, or&#xD;
something of equal value, as you yourself may judge. But leavenm&#xD;
now; I would not for the world be seen by any person-who knows me&#xD;
. " In my company you mean, Miss," said the fellow with a satanic&#xD;
smile, "but I guess you've been in worse company than mine, or soon&#xD;
will be, if you force me to have you arrested. As for leaving you,&#xD;
don't think of it ; I'in going to stick by you, until some satisfactory&#xD;
'rangement is made atween us."&#xD;
"Oh heaven! what shall I do ?" said Adeline, wringing her hands.&#xD;
I tell you," said she, again addressing her tormentor, "my father is&#xD;
one of the richest men inthe city, and if you will do as I' bid you, I will&#xD;
be soon able to give you more money than ever you bad in your life."&#xD;
"Ahern! what's your papa's name, Miss :r"said'the fellow in a&#xD;
mocking tone. " It's very strange, Miss, that sich a great young lady&#xD;
should have to steal a pair of gloves. That rich papa of your'n must&#xD;
be a mighty stingy old curmudgeon, I .hould think. But what's his&#xD;
name, that's the pint I want to fend out."&#xD;
"I must not tell you; I had rather die than tell my name," said&#xD;
Adeline.&#xD;
" Oh, ho! then I'll keep with you, till you go home, and I can spell&#xD;
it out on the door-plate."&#xD;
Adeline stood, irresolute on the pavement. The curiosity of the&#xD;
passers by, appeared to be excited by the appearance of such an ele-&#xD;
gantly dressed and seemingly respectable young lady, in earnest con-&#xD;
versation with a man, who was evidently a plebeian of' the lowest order.&#xD;
Some persons seemed to.walk slowly, or to make a half pause, as if to&#xD;
catch a word of their discourse. In the meantime the anguish of the&#xD;
wretched girl was reaching its climax ". bf&#xD;
"I will drown myself in the dock," said she at last, before I will&#xD;
go home followed by you. You will gain nothing by driving me to&#xD;
desperation.- But come after me to that jewller's shop, on the other&#xD;
sieof the street, and hear me ask him what this. racelet is worth&#xD;
IHis reply will convince you that I have not deceived you."&#xD;
The fellow acceded to this proposal, and the report of the jeweller,&#xD;
when he had examined the bracelet, was so favorable, that the 'rascal&#xD;
snatched at it eagerly as soon as Adeline and he had emerged fom th&#xD;

SmE REALIZES$ HER TERRIBLE POSITION.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You stole it of course," said he, "and you must understand the&#xD;
game better than I thought. Well, I'll'dispose of'this affair, and give&#xD;
you half the money, but as I find that you're.so well up to the trade,&#xD;
I must insist on being your pardner. -You must do reglar day's work,&#xD;
and be industrious. I'll sell whatever you can fetch me, and make an&#xD;
honest division of the spiles."&#xD;
"But you promised that you would leave me on receipt of fifty dollars&#xD;
* or an equivalent."'&#xD;
"I've changed my mind," said the fellow with dogged resolution, "I&#xD;
must know where you live before I lose sight of you."&#xD;
Adeline now remembered a poor Irish woman, residing in Church.&#xD;
Street, for whose family she had done several acts of kindness, and&#xD;
being unable.to think of any better expedient, she determined to go to&#xD;
'this woman's dwelling, and so make her troublesome companion believe&#xD;
that it was her own place of residence. On her way thither, he still&#xD;
walked by her side, offering her great inducements, as he thought, to&#xD;
engage in the occupation of a thief. Among other confidential in-&#xD;
formation, which he vouchsafed to her, he gave her to understand that&#xD;
his name was. Hickson, and that his business was "fencing," meaning&#xD;
to signify that he was a receiver of stolen goods.&#xD;
It is impossible to describe or even to imagine,  iss Fosbenner's&#xD;
agonies of mind, when she found herself associated with this infamous&#xD;
person. Glance at that proud beauty, who but a few hours before was&#xD;
an object of universal envy or admiration, in the higher circles of&#xD;
fashion. See her now cowering before one of the most degraded of'&#xD;
human beings, submitting to his insolence and pleading'4for his com-&#xD;
passion.&#xD;
IHere was a change indeed; and it came on her like some mighty&#xD;
convulsion of nature, an earthquake, an overwhelming torrent, or a&#xD;
tornado, producing a 'kind of stupefaction or lethargy, which almost&#xD;
deprived her of the power of thought /or action. She found it hard. to&#xD;
realize the truth, that all this trouble proceeded from so trivial a 'matter&#xD;
as a- pair of gloves; but then she remembered that she had comma fitted&#xD;
a criminal deed, a felony, an act which might consign her to a male-&#xD;
factor's cell in the state's prison. And here by her side was the ac-&#xD;
cusing spirit, who controlled her destiny, who could instantlysumn&#xD;
the ministers of justice to take her in charge.        stmo&#xD;
It was in the power of this bad man, to have hor dragged like any&#xD;
other criminal, through the' crowded 'streets of the city, to make her a&#xD;
spectacle for the jeering populace, to blast her reputation for ever, and&#xD;
&#xD;
l 26&#xD;
&#xD;
her, in a measure, of all power of body or mind. At length  he arose&#xD;
and rushed wildly from the apartment, convincing Mrs. McFadden that&#xD;
shetwas a maniac.ht Adeline hurried though the dimly lighted street&#xD;
* It ws now  ight.hdelinehurrie&#xD;
and entered once more'the elegant mansion of her family, feeling that&#xD;
she was no longer worthy to be an inhabitant thereof. Her first&#xD;

ADELINE ESCAPES FROM HER PERSECUTOR."2T&#xD;
to have the story of her guilt scattered abroad, through the public&#xD;
journals, to the remotest part of the country.&#xD;
She felt that she was a slave, and that a being whom she utterly&#xD;
despised and loathed was her master.&#xD;
Her faculties. we say were overpowered by all these terrible con-&#xD;
siderations. Had she had more experience in the ways of the world,&#xD;
or had she retained the power of reflection, some means of extricating&#xD;
herself from her calamitous situadon, might have presented itself to her&#xD;
mind. She might have made        situation known to her father, orb&#xD;
some other experienced friend. That, indeed, would have been the&#xD;
wisest course, but to her perceptions, death seemed more tolerable than&#xD;
a confession of her fault to any human being.  She might .have sought&#xD;
the advice of a lawyer, who could easily have effected an accomodation&#xD;
of the. matter, but had she even thought of this expedient, she could&#xD;
not have made use of it, without stating the disgraceful fact to her&#xD;
legal adviser, and for her to do that would have been impossible.&#xD;
The Irishwoman to whose dwelling she now directed her steps, war&#xD;
named McFadden. Her'husband had been killed in battle about the&#xD;
beginning of the war, and left her a widow with two small children.&#xD;
A-few weeks prior to the events, with which our 'narrative commences,&#xD;
one of Mrs. McFadden's children, while begging in the street, had,&#xD;
excited the compassion of Miss Fosbenner, who learned from   the&#xD;
child where his mother lived, and- she had several times since visited&#xD;
the poor widow's house and relieved her distresses, without making the&#xD;
object of her bounty acquainted with her name or condition in life.&#xD;
Still accompanied by Hickson, Adeline now entered Mrs. McFad&#xD;
den's house, and taking the widow aside, she begged her in a few&#xD;
hurried and almost incoherent words, to assist her in making Hickonk&#xD;
'4     believe that she resided in that place. To this Mrs. McFadden made&#xD;
no objection,.as she was under great obligations to MissFosbenner;,&#xD;
and iickson being now satisfied that he knew where Adeline might be&#xD;
found, gave her an expressive warning not to make any attempt to&#xD;
elude him and then withdrew.&#xD;
For some time after his departure, the miserable girl sat still in Mrs.&#xD;
McFadden's humble abode, her alarm and sufferings having deprived&#xD;

28                 HER RELATIVES ALARMED.&#xD;
o ject now was to destroy the fatal gloves, which had been the cause&#xD;
o  all her affli tion.- When they were reduced to ashes, her harassed&#xD;
nd experien ed some temporary relief. But the events of a few&#xD;
hou    ad   de alterations in her personal appearance which could not&#xD;
escape the notice of her relatives.&#xD;
Miss Dorcas Fosbenner, a sister of Adeline's father who resided with&#xD;
him, was the first to observe the change which had taken place in&#xD;
Adehines -countenance and demeanor, and being very much alarmed&#xD;
thereat, she called Mr. Fosbenrier's attention to the subject.&#xD;
Indeed, the appearance of the young lady was calculated to awaken&#xD;
the apprehensions of her affectionate aunt. The roseate tinge of beauty&#xD;
had fled from  her cheeks, a ghastly paleness overspread her whole&#xD;
countenance; and her eye, which lately sparkled with animation and&#xD;
happiness, now alternated between the wildest expression of terror and&#xD;
the fixed gaze of despair.&#xD;
As soon as Mr. Fosbenner's attention was directed to these wonderful&#xD;
changes, he inquired with much anxiety, if anything extraordinary had&#xD;
occurred to alarm or distress her, or whether she had been seized with&#xD;
suden illness.  The manner in which she, evaded those affectionate&#xD;
inquiries, served only to increase' the uneasiness of her father and aunt,&#xD;
but they found it impossible to obtain any satisfactory explanation.&#xD;
For several days, Adeline kept her solitary chamber, brooding Rover&#xD;
her misfortunes and refusing'to see any company.&#xD;
The great fancy ball had passed away, but she had ceased to feel or&#xD;
express any interest in the affair. She could not be persuaded to&#xD;
appear at that grand exhibition, and her relations were now convinced&#xD;
that her intellect was disordered. This suspicion was probably correct&#xD;
in a measure, as it is impossible to account for all her subsequent cor&#xD;
duct, without supposing that her reasoning faculties had been impaired.&#xD;
She sat for uncounted hours in listless idleness, her eyes fixed on the&#xD;
ground and her whole appearance indicating the d e pest dejection.&#xD;
This state of things continued for two weeks, at the end of which&#xD;
time she began to recover some of her former cheerfulness, and at length'&#xD;
hewas persuaded to walk abroad occasionally, but it was observed that&#xD;
she always did so with evident reluctance.&#xD;
One day she had agreed to accompany several of her young friends&#xD;
in 'a promenade to Union 'Square. One .of the party was Charles&#xD;
Mayherry, a young naval officer, who appeared to 1)e deeply in love&#xD;
with Iiss' Fosbenner, and it was believed by many that she was not&#xD;
indife ent to his merits. While the young peor le were walking through&#xD;
mh enclosure, Adelmne, who seemed for the time to have resumed much&#xD;

ADELINE AND THE RUrFIAN.'2&#xD;
off her former vivacitsuddnly uttered an exclamation of terror and&#xD;
laced her hands before heeyes, as if to shut out some frightf:d&#xD;
apparition.&#xD;
IIer companions looked in the direction from which the object of her&#xD;
alarm seemed to approach.&#xD;
A man of very unprepossessing appearance was advancing towards&#xD;
Adeline, hisserpent eye being fastened on her with an expression of&#xD;
tinumph. When he came near, he yelled out in most discordant toncsi&#xD;
"Aha ! Miss, I have found.-you again&#xD;
She made no answer, except adeep groan.&#xD;
Mayberry, being very much incensed at the behaviour of the intruder,&#xD;
advanced, seized him by the throat, and after shaking him violently&#xD;
threw him on the ground.&#xD;
The man arose with some difficulty, having been considerably&#xD;
punished by the vigorous handling he had received, and without takiog&#xD;
yny notice o- his assailant, he again addressed himself to Adeline,-&#xD;
"You cheated me the other evening, young woman, but I will make&#xD;
sure of you now.",&#xD;
Mr. Mayberry, observing the increasing distress and alarm of. Ad&#xD;
line, said=&#xD;
"Do you know this person, Miss Fosbenner, or will. you permit me&#xD;
to give him the chastisement he deserves, and drive him from your&#xD;
presence.&#xD;
"Oh no! no!    For heaven's sake, no,"answered Adeline, in great&#xD;
treidation, "the man has a message for me, and I must hear him.&#xD;
The surprise of her companions was boundless, but they withdrew to&#xD;
some distance and left her alone with Ilickson.'&#xD;
"N~ow, my gal," said he~ "your hot-heated beau has given me a&#xD;
pretty bad hurt, but I'll not take that into the account. .But you must&#xD;
gve me some kind of security for your appearance, whenever Iwant t~&#xD;
see you.&#xD;
" What kind of security can I give you ?' asked Adeline, piteously.&#xD;
"If you want money, you shall have it as soon as I receive my next&#xD;
quarterly allowance, I can do nothing more."&#xD;
" Quarterly allowance ! Bah ! -Don't try than trick on me-I've&#xD;

ADELINE. TAKES A TERRIBLE OATH.              8&#xD;
mice little article among sicn crdnies,'.and I-can dispose of 'em to niore&#xD;
ad] wan tage than any -body 'else.in this' city  .But .you must swear asrI&#xD;
tell you- and heaven'-help jou if you don't keep your oath.'.'&#xD;
"What must I swear?"&#xD;
"That you will meet me at the woman, McFadden's, over Friday&#xD;
at three o'clock, to 'give an account'-of your week's work."&#xD;
"I can not make such an engagement," answered 4deline.&#xD;
"Then you shall never leave this ground,.till you' are arrested'!" said.&#xD;
Hickson, in a loud and angry tone; "and I will begin by telling your&#xD;
proud friends, yonder, to give you -the ,dead-cut, because you are a&#xD;
thief, which they. don't seem to know at present."&#xD;
"I will engage to give you a hundred :dollars on the first day of every&#xD;
month," said Adeline, "if you will have pity on me,:and not drive me&#xD;
to some'act of desperation."&#xD;
"A hundreds dollars a month ? tut! that's a flee-bite.' A smart ga&#xD;
like you can 'arn. ten times.as much by pigging small fancy articles&#xD;
from the trimming shops; but if you go into. the.je welry line, your&#xD;
pickings will be worth thousands a nionth instead of hundreds."&#xD;
"I have no wish to follow such . trade, and I never will consent *&#xD;
do it."F)&#xD;
" If that's your resolution,:I'velone with you, madam, and I'll ban'&#xD;
you over to that policeman that's jest coming in at the gate. Shall.I&#xD;
call him,?"'&#xD;
"Wait one moment. I will write to my brother, who is nom,    _&#xD;
Princeton College, and entreat him to lend me some money. You shai'&#xD;
be well paid for your forbearance."&#xD;
"No. Promises won't do.   Your brother at iPrinteton Oollge !-&#xD;
more likely he's at Sing Sing. Swear this instant, o rby--.....' I'll settle&#xD;
the business at once, and you'll be locked 'up befureshalf an hour."&#xD;
lIe then dictated a terrible oath, the terms' of which almost froze&#xD;
Adeline's blood, but. she saw that there was no alternative, exceptare'&#xD;
posure and utter ruin, or a compliance with the villain's dem~and.&#xD;
The oath was taken ; she bound herself not only to meet Llickson ~a&#xD;
the titne and place specified, but to -remain in the city and to make no&#xD;
effort to escape from his control. All this he required :of her, and 'all&#xD;
her tears and entreaties could 'not 'prevail -on him to mitigate these&#xD;
&#xD;
requirements.&#xD;
Ilickson, having thus .accomplished his objet, charged her to be&#xD;
punctual in her engagement, and4 after 'uttering various threats- to&#xD;
enforce his authority, bade her a surly good morning, and left the&#xD;
square.&#xD;

Miss Doreas, thinking there might be some truth in Mary's supposi-&#xD;
tion, which indeed was partly confirmed by her own observation,&#xD;
immediately went to communicate the whole matter to Mr. Fosbenner,.&#xD;
giving it as her opinion that it was "a very, serious case, as her niece's&#xD;
health, and life, perhaps,.would depend on her father's decision, whether&#xD;
she should or should nt be united to the man of her choice."&#xD;
&#xD;
4           FEARUL MYTERY--ADELINE'S    CONDUCT.&#xD;
This man's tyrannical behaviour to Adeline seemed to proceed from&#xD;
some' other motive besides avarice, although that was, certainly one of&#xD;
his ruling passions. He..seemed to take a diabolical pleasure in&#xD;
tormenting his victim  and triumphing over one, whom he must have-&#xD;
felt to be, in some respects, superior to himself.&#xD;
Adeline's companions now returned to her, but all' conversation was&#xD;
at an end. The whole party seemed to be occupied with thoughts and&#xD;
conjectures.respecting the scene they had just witnessed, and which, ofr&#xD;
course, it was impossible for them to understand.&#xD;
The distress of Adeline could not be concealed, and Mr. Mayberry's&#xD;
dejection of spirits was scarcely less than hers. The attachment he&#xD;
had formed for her could not blind him to the fact that there was some-&#xD;
fearful mystery in her conduct. She evidently stood in awe of the,&#xD;
ruffian who had accosted her in the square; circumstances had proved&#xD;
that she dared not offend him. How did she become acquainted with-&#xD;
that suspicious person ? And how did he obtain such an apparent&#xD;
ascendency over her?&#xD;
These were the questions which agita  Mr. Mayberry's mind, as&#xD;
the conducted Adeline to her home. On arri ng at the door, he took&#xD;
leave of her with a sad countenance, and  deline, hastening to her&#xD;
apartment, threw herself on her bed and abandoned herself to the most&#xD;
-agonizing and terrible reflections.'&#xD;
Meanwhile, a female domestic who was very much attached to Ade-&#xD;
line, and who was deeply concerned on account of the deep melancholy.&#xD;
into which the young lady had fallen,'informed Miss Dorcas, Adeline's&#xD;
aunt, that she knew the cause of Miss Fosbenner's unhappiness; " but,"&#xD;
said she, "I would never have told what I know, if I did not think-&#xD;
Miss Addy's health would suffer if the whole truth should not be made&#xD;
known to her father."&#xD;
Miss Dorcas, suspecting that some extraordinary revelation was about&#xD;
to be made, requested Mary to tell what she knew.&#xD;
"Well, the whole matter is," said Mary, "that Miss Addy is in love&#xD;
with Mr. Mayberry, and because he is not very rich, she thinks her'&#xD;
father will never consent to -their marriage. -I am quite certain that&#xD;
this makes all her trouble."&#xD;

This direct appeal to the parental affection of Mr. Fosbenner, had&#xD;
the desired effect. He expressed the highest esteem for Mr. Mayberrys&#xD;
'character and declared that his want of a large fortune, should be up&#xD;
obstacle to his union with Adeline, if both of the young people were&#xD;
inclined to the match, Miss Dorcas thought there could be no doubt&#xD;
on that point, and this assurance being given, Mr. Fosbenner promised&#xD;
to open the negotiation, as Miss Dorcas suggested that the reason why&#xD;
Mr. Mayberry had never proposed, was his dread of a rejection by&#xD;
Adeline's friends on account of his inadequate fortune.&#xD;
The next day, ,Ir. Mayberry called to enquire after Adeline's health&#xD;
and Mr. Fosbenner took that opportunity to broach the subject, which&#xD;
was uppermost in his thoughts. lie signified to the young gentleman,&#xD;
that he had taken notice of his attentions to Adeline, which had been&#xD;
continued for nearly two years, and he thought it was time to come to&#xD;
n understanding on the subject.&#xD;
To deal frankly with you," said the old gentleman,'" I have&#xD;
accidently discovered that my daughter is favorably disposed towards&#xD;
you, andi'yur feelings towards her are such as we may infer from&#xD;
your   quentvisits, there is nothing to "prevent the settlement of the&#xD;
.affair to your mutual satisfaction."&#xD;
Mr. Mayberry grasped the old merchant's hand, and pressed it with&#xD;
grateful cordiality as he replied:&#xD;
"Mr. Fosbenner, the proof you have just given me" of your good&#xD;
opinion and friendship, is most gratifying to my feelings, and two days&#xD;
ago the intimations you have made, would have overwhelmed me with&#xD;
joyful emotions, but- '&#xD;
" Well sir,"said Mr. Fosbenner, somewhat stiffly, "perhaps we have&#xD;
misunderstood each other ; if so, let us drop the subject at once and&#xD;
forever."&#xD;
"D'o not be offended with me, my dear sir," said Mr. Mayberry,&#xD;
still pressing his hand, "there is a circumstance which I ought to have&#xD;
communicated to you before. My friendship for you and the fervent&#xD;
love I feel for your daughter,, should have prompted me to do so, but I&#xD;
was unwilling to take a step, which I knew would be a cause of um .&#xD;
easiness to you, but I will hesitate no longer, as the kindness you have&#xD;
ghown me, and the debt of gratitude which I owe you, would make it&#xD;
almost criminal on my part to keep the affair concealed any longer.'&#xD;
He then gave Mr. Fosbenner an account of the scene in Uniorn&#xD;
~Square, and although the incidents were softened and made more favor-.&#xD;
able to Adeline in Mr. Mayberry's statement, Mr. Fosbenner was&#xD;
absolutely dismayed by the recital.&#xD;

"My dear boy," said he to Mr. Mayberry, "advise me if you can.&#xD;
I need not request you to refrain from repeating this frightful story to&#xD;
others, but tell me- candidly what you suspect. Good heavens! I&#xD;
would as soon have suspected&amp;amp;an angel in heaven of any improper act&#xD;
or of any disgraceful associations. What can it mean-?"&#xD;
"I can form no conjecture," said Mr. Mayberry very sadly, "perhaps&#xD;
such an explanation ma    given by Miss Adeliie herself, as will re-&#xD;
move every unpleasant suspicio from our minds."&#xD;
"No," replied Mr. Fosbenner, "she will explain nothing.  We&#xD;
questioned her closely concerning her melancholy, and the strange al-&#xD;
terations which have tiken phice in her habits and appearance, but she&#xD;
will give us no information whatever. I will go to her once more and&#xD;
insist -on a full explanation of this most unaccountable conduct."&#xD;
"Let me beg you not to be harsh with her," said Mr. Mayberry,&#xD;
"perhaps it would he better to wait until she recovers in some measure&#xD;
from he- present state of dejection, and it may be that when she is&#xD;
more composed in mind, she will voluntarily give you all the information-&#xD;
you wish."&#xD;
Having offered this suggestion, Mr. Maybery endeavored to comfort&#xD;
the afflicted father by expressing a hope, which he scarcely felt, that,&#xD;
-all might turn out well. Ie then took leave of his old friend, and the&#xD;
latter hastened to make Miss Dorcas acquainted with the facts of&#xD;
Adeline's case, which had just come to his knowledge.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, Adeline herself was enduring agonies of mind,&#xD;
compared with whicli all bodily torments would have been insignificant .&#xD;
She could not violate the dreadful oath she had taken ; for it seemed&#xD;
to her that the safety of her soul depended on the fulfillment of that&#xD;
obligation. - She must meet Hickson at the appointed place, but as for&#xD;
beginning the career of a professional thief, in obedience to his require-&#xD;
anents, it was a thought, which she could not bear to entertain for&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
The night was passed in sleepless anguish ; the day dawned, but in&#xD;
Adeline's soul all was still, dark and comfortless. No means of de=&#xD;
lverance presented itself to her mind. - She would trust no one with&#xD;
her secret, and of course she could have no adviser or sympathising&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
Jn this way several days passed over and Friday came. Friday!&#xD;
the day appointed for her interview with Ilickson. Feeling that she&#xD;
must endure that trial, she prepared herself for it with a desperate&#xD;
6fort. She was punctual to the hour and found Hickson already at&#xD;

THE HEARTuEss VILLAIN.&#xD;
" What have you got for me ? Give me what you have collected."&#xD;
" I have nothing," said Adeline faintly, but seeing that he was very&#xD;
much disappointed and enraged, she added "except these," taking&#xD;
several small articles of jewelry from her dress and presenting them&#xD;
to the heartless villain.&#xD;
"This is not much," said he, "you must do better or I shall have to&#xD;
punish you. But you must go with me now to a place where you will&#xD;
learn something useful. After all, I don't think you're very well up&#xD;
to all the tricks of the trade. You must take lessons. Come with&#xD;
me.&#xD;
"For mercy's sake let me go home," said Adeline, "I cannot go&#xD;
with you; I cannot be seen&#xD;
"Ha-! ha ! ha !'' laughed Hickson, "ashamed to be seen with men&#xD;
By      you act -,that well. .But I have no time for such fooling.&#xD;
Come along."&#xD;
He seized her by the arm and dragged her towards the door. She&#xD;
begged him to desist and promised that she would follow him without&#xD;
compulsion.&#xD;
"Well, if you choose to follow me like a dog, rather than walk by&#xD;
my side like a lady ; well, have your own way," said 'Hickson, "so as&#xD;
you come somehow I'm satisfied."&#xD;
Followed by Adeline, Hickson passed through several bye street&#xD;
and alleys, till he came to a snra1Twooden building, situated in a nook&#xD;
among those intricate passages. Hickson opened the door withod&#xD;
knocking, and led the way into a shabby apartment on the first floor&#xD;
where two young women were seated, each one reading a Sunday paper&#xD;
and apparently very much absorbed in'its contents.&#xD;
"Come gals, you are losing too much time," said Hlickson, "don't&#xD;
you know that time is money, and every minute lost is so much cash&#xD;
out of your pocket. Have you been out on your beats this morning.'&#xD;
"We were out till one o'clock;" answered one of the girls, "and as&#xD;
we met with  retty good luck, we thought we might. take an hour or&#xD;
two to improve our minds."&#xD;
"Why, I've no great objection to that," said Hickson, " I rather&#xD;
like to see gals fond of reading. I take pretty well to perlite literature&#xD;
myself, and some of them stories in the weekly papers are jest to my&#xD;
liking. But let's see what you have picked up this morning."&#xD;
Each girl produced a package, opened it and spread the contents out&#xD;
en a table. The plunder consisted of fine handkerchiefs, stockings,&#xD;
gloves, pieces of lace and ribbon, and other small wares, such as could&#xD;
conveniently be stolen from the counters of dry good's stores, millinery&#xD;

shops, &amp;amp;c. Hickson examined 'the goods without any particular signs&#xD;
Qf approbation.&#xD;
"lHumph! no great matter," said he, "but I'm glad to find that&#xD;
you've been doing something at all events. Gals should be industrious.&#xD;
You've heard tell that idleness 'is the root of all evil. Now Bet and&#xD;
Sal here's another crony for yob. I don't know her name, but you&#xD;
can ax her what 'tis and so get acquainted. 'She wants training ; show&#xD;
her how you work, and if you choose, when you go out again, you can&#xD;
take her with you to learn the practical part of the business."&#xD;
So saying he gathered up the stolen goods, and mnnde a portable&#xD;
bundle of them, by tying them up in a handkerchief; then giving each&#xD;
of the girls a small sum of money, he went away leaving Adeline with&#xD;
her new associates. The young women scowled at her with evident&#xD;
dislike. Her beauty, probably, and a certain air of superiority, which her&#xD;
sorrow could not conceal, did not prepossess them in her favor. They&#xD;
stared at her in silence for some minutes and then one of them abruptly said:&#xD;
"Well girl, what is your name ? "&#xD;
"Adeine with some hesitation answered, "Susan Baker."&#xD;
"Susan be d-   d," said the other girl, "we shall call you Suke."&#xD;
"And what's your lay Ske ?" said the first interrogator.&#xD;
As Adeline made no answer to this question, which indeed she.did"&#xD;
t understand, the questioner anglicized it by saying, -&#xD;
"What's your line of business, Suke ?"&#xD;
Adeline seemed to be still at fault, and Bet bawled out in an angry&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
SD-- it, are you so fresh? What kind of things do you ginerally.&#xD;
steal ? Do you understand that  rNow, what is the fool crying about?&#xD;
What a confounded baby that old rascal has brought us ! Does he&#xD;
think that I'd go a prigging in such company. Why some of these'&#xD;
tricks of hers would be sure to have us grabbed."&#xD;
That's so," said Sal, "she shan't work with us; see her blessed&#xD;
first. Let her try it awhile on her own 'sponsibility."&#xD;
But I s'pose we'll have to show her some of the dodges," said. Bet,&#xD;
relentingly, "we mustn't be too hard on her, if she hastn't got any&#xD;
'complishments.  Every one must have a beginning. Now Suke, did&#xD;
you ever steal a piece of ribbon."&#xD;
" No, never," answered Adeline mournfully.&#xD;
," Well, I'll put a lot of ribbon blocks on this here table. Now,,&#xD;
emadgin that every one cf them blocks -has got twelve yards of&#xD;
satin ribbon wotuid around. it. Let's see you slip one of them&#xD;

SUSAN BAE3R AMD HER. COMPANIONs.&#xD;
&#xD;
To                'ESQ., ATTORNEY AT LAW.&#xD;
Sir. The writer of this is a most unhappy gir, who has become int&#xD;
evolved in great difficulties by one criminal action.. Some influence&#xD;
for which I cannot now account, prompted me to steal: an -article of&#xD;
trifling value from a dry-good's store. A man of very bad character',&#xD;
ivho happened to be in the store at the time, was the only witness of th&#xD;
tieft. Ile has, ever since, exercised a control over my actions, b&#xD;
I ijreatening to have me arrested, and he uses this means of intimidati4&#xD;
to compel me to steal continually, for his benefit. My family is in affluent&#xD;
Oireumstances, but nothing can induce me to reveal my name. tf&#xD;
you are disposed to advise and assist me,-in this difficulty, you shall be&#xD;
well paid for your trouble. Let me know if you can suggest' Any meani&#xD;
&#xD;
-Wl" Ir""j zvr-&#xD;
&#xD;
Adeline took up one of the blocks.&#xD;
" Is .that the way you'd do it," said Sal with a sneer, "then&#xD;
angme if you wouldn't git what you deserve for your cussed awkward-,&#xD;
ness. I tell you what it is, Bet, I don't like to speak disrespectfully&#xD;
of my feller creters, but my solemn 'pinion is that this gal will never:&#xD;
make a decent prig.&#xD;
"It's not in her," said Bet, "she hasn't got the lateral genus."&#xD;
"But Hickson's got a different notion," said Sal, "he says he saw&#xD;
her hook a pair of dollar kid gloves quite slick at Baldwin's store, and.&#xD;
she .hooked that bracelet he showed us, so she can't be sich a clumsy&#xD;
fool after all."&#xD;
"I s'pect Suke," said Bet, "you kin do better with jewelry; stick&#xD;
to that and it will pay you well."&#xD;
"I should like to go home, if you have no objection," said Adeliiu&#xD;
timidly.&#xD;
"You maly go to the d-, for what I. care," answered Bet.&#xD;
"And further too," said Sal, "if you don't feel comfortable when yciu&#xD;
happen to get into decent company."&#xD;
Availing herself of this leave of absence, Adeline hastily departed.&#xD;
A  new cause of - terror now presented itself. She saw that her fate&#xD;
would introduce her to the companionship of disreputable women, such&#xD;
as those she had just left. This thought was more distressing and&#xD;
terrific to her, than her dread of the State's Prison. She resolved to&#xD;
do something to put an end to these intolerable troubles and persecu-&#xD;
tions. - Death itself would have been a most welcome relief, but her&#xD;
-religious feelings would not allow her to determinO on suicide.&#xD;
It was. about this time, that I received from  her the following&#xD;
letter&#xD;

of ecape for me, and I will write to you again. Address S. B. at&#xD;
Mrs. McFadden'g No---Church Street.&#xD;
I answered this note, by informing the writer that I could not advise&#xD;
her unless she could make me acquainted with all the circumstances of&#xD;
the case, and the names of the parties.  This, it seems, she was un' il-&#xD;
ling to do, for the correspondence was dropped, and the hurry of busi-&#xD;
ness. prevented 4me from thinking any more of the matter. I now&#xD;
deeply regret that I did not give her my assistance, which I certainly&#xD;
would have done; had-I believed that her representations of the affair&#xD;
were true. As Ilickson was the only witness against her, and as he.&#xD;
was a man of infamous character, the charge of theft preferred by him&#xD;
would have obtained no credit. Indeed by having him indicted forde-&#xD;
ceiving stolen goods, which could easily have been done, he might have&#xD;
been put out of the way, before he had an opportunity to bring a charge&#xD;
against Miss Fosbenner. But, her excessive anxiety to keep her name&#xD;
bidden, deprived her'of the benefit of legal advice, and left her in the&#xD;
power of one of the blackest villains, that ever disgraced the human form.&#xD;
At the time when the letter came to my hands, I observed the singu-&#xD;
lar beauty of the chirography. It was the prettiest female hand I had&#xD;
ever seen, and this circumstance enabled me to recogniz the same&#xD;
writing afterwards.&#xD;
During the week succeeding the events we have related, Adeline,&#xD;
instead of employing herself in thieving, according to the order of&#xD;
Dickson, selected some of her finest jewelry as an offering to this&#xD;
severe task-master, intending to make him  believe that the articles&#xD;
were obtained in the manner he had ordered. The trinkets were o&#xD;
great value, but when Adeline presented them, the wretch whose avarice&#xD;
was insatiable, still expressed his discontent.&#xD;
"Why it would be very easy," he said, "foryou to collect a bushel of&#xD;
these things in a week. You must bring more of them the next time&#xD;
you come, or we sh-ll have a quarrel. Now I want you to go to- the&#xD;
house where I took you last Friday, (you know the way,) and help the&#xD;
other girls to do some work which I have set them at."&#xD;
"I would rather not go there," said Adeline, ".I am quite ill to day&#xD;
and unable to work."&#xD;
" None of your idle excuses, i'eplied ilicison, "go you must and&#xD;
that's the end of it."&#xD;
This was said in such a brutal and decided tone, that she despaired&#xD;
of producing any~iffect on his mind by expostulation or entr-caties, and&#xD;
although a visit to the house occupied by Bet and Sal, was one of the&#xD;

severest trials to which she could have been subjected, she'found that&#xD;
it was unavoidable, and proceeded at once to the detested place.&#xD;
While she was pleading with Hickson, in the manner we have&#xD;
described, she observed that her Irish friend, Mrs. McFadden, seemed&#xD;
to be very much excited. This woman had always disliked Hickson,&#xD;
and at times when'he tyrannized over Adeline, her indignation. ap-&#xD;
1  pearedto be roused to such a degree, that it threatened to break forth&#xD;
into some violent demonstration.&#xD;
Once when 'she was alone with lMiss Fosbenner, she informed the&#xD;
young lady, that Iickson had endeavored to "pump " her as she ex-&#xD;
pressed it, that is, by cross-questioning, to btain some account of Ad..&#xD;
line's history and family connections.&#xD;
"In coorse," said Mrs. (McFadden, when she related this to Adeline,&#xD;
"I tould him.nothing, seeing that I knew nothing' myself, and if I had&#xD;
known iver so much, sorrow a bit of information should the rascal have'&#xD;
got from me. All that I know of-you is, that you helped me to get'&#xD;
food and medicine for my sick children, and if you were as bad as&#xD;
Hickson says you are, or if you were the divil himself, I should love&#xD;
and honor you for your kindness to my poor little Johnny and Ellen,'&#xD;
and if it warn't to plaze you, sure I wouldn't let the ugly baste come&#xD;
into my house."&#xD;
With some, difficulty Adeline found her way to the obscure dwelling&#xD;
of Hickson's female confederates. They expressed no gratification at&#xD;
seeing her again, but ordered her to join them in a task at which they&#xD;
were busily engaged when she entered.&#xD;
This task was the removal of all the store-marks, from  a large&#xD;
quantity of fancy goods, which had unquestionably been stolen, and&#xD;
the object now was to leave no signs about them, which('vould enable&#xD;
the rightful owners to identify them, if any clue to their whereabouts&#xD;
should be discovered.&#xD;
Very reluctantly Adeline began to, assist in their nefarious labor,&#xD;
Bet and Sal, all the time, making her the butt of their malicious ridi-&#xD;
-cule; but her -spirits were too much prostrated to allow her to resent&#xD;
this insulting behaviour, . What must then have been the bitter re-&#xD;
flections of the fashionable belle, who had always boen accustomed to&#xD;
the kindest 'and most respectful 'treatment from all who 'approached&#xD;
'her. It is really wonderful that she' could retain possession of her&#xD;
lenses under such a dreadful reverse of' fortune.&#xD;
It was almost night when the work was finished, and then Bet in-&#xD;
formed Adeli'ne, that she was at liberty to go, but immediately added :&#xD;
"llickson says we must take you out with us to-morrow, and see,.&#xD;
&#xD;
)NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
PERILOUS ADVENTURE.&#xD;
if y9u can help us. I don't like the notion myself, but I s'pose I'll&#xD;
have to run the risk of being nabbed to please him. But if any trouble&#xD;
comes to me on your account, cuss me if I don't stab you. Now be off&#xD;
and see that you are here to-morrow by nice o'clock."&#xD;
With a swelling heart and streaming eyes, Adeline left the place and&#xD;
began to search out her way among the intricate streets and alleys,&#xD;
but the confusion of her mind and the increasing darkness, soon caused&#xD;
her to go astray.&#xD;
In about half an hour, she found herself in a part of the city, which&#xD;
she had seldom or never seen before. Many drunken and disorderly&#xD;
people were perambulating the pavements and the whole neighborhood&#xD;
.seemed to be in a state of unhealthy excitement. Before the door of&#xD;
a low grog-shop, several dissipated-looking young men were gathered.&#xD;
By the light of a dim crimson-shaded lamp, which hung over the.door&#xD;
of the groggery, she saw enough of these persons to make her wish to&#xD;
avoid them. Being about to cross the street for that purpose, she dis-&#xD;
covered that a still more repulsive gang, was^ stationed orb the other&#xD;
side, so preferring the lesser evil, she proceeded on her course.&#xD;
One of the rowdies immediat- tooktok a position in the middle of the&#xD;
pavement, and stretched out his ums as if to intercept her on her way.&#xD;
In great alarm she paused, and the fellow advanced to the spot where&#xD;
she stood. He was dressed in something like fashionable array, but&#xD;
the flashy style of his equipments, and an ostentatious display of glittering&#xD;
chains and other bijouterie, which might have been either gold or copper&#xD;
confirmed a suspicion which his manner and general appearance ex-&#xD;
cited, namely that he was not a real gentleman.&#xD;
" Here is my girl now," said 'this unattractive person. "How are&#xD;
you Lizzy ?" Then grasping Adeline's arm, he added," come in and re-&#xD;
fresh yourself ith a gin cock-tail."&#xD;
"You are mistaken, sir," said the affrighted Adeline, "my name&#xD;
is not Lizzy' andI never saw you before. Let me pass."&#xD;
" Can't think of it, my dear. beauty like yours is a cash article in&#xD;
this neighborhood, but as for letting it pass without some examination&#xD;
it's not our custom, and blow me high if I don't have a kiss or two&#xD;
before you proceed any further."&#xD;
H-ere he attempted to throw his arms around her. Adeline uttered&#xD;
a piercing scream, which was answered by a loud 'laugh and cries of&#xD;
"'go it Joe," " take care of her claws," "hold her, tight," &amp;amp;c., from&#xD;
the various- group of spectators standing about the neighborhood.&#xD;
At that moment, a carriage was' driven rapidly through the street.&#xD;
'The sound of Adeline's scream seemed to: attract attention. Tha&#xD;

TnE RmDsouiAfiE DELIVILER.&#xD;
&#xD;
vehicle paused, a gentleman leaped out and approached the spot, where&#xD;
she was struggling with her assailant. A blow from a walking-stick in.&#xD;
the gentlen.an's hand laid the ruffian on the pavement. At the same&#xD;
moment a rush was made by some of the spectators, as if to take ven-&#xD;
geance for the assault on their comrade.&#xD;
The gentleman taking Adeline's arm, led her towards the coach, and&#xD;
at the same time kept the rowdies at bay with his cane, several  them&#xD;
receiving some severe blows, while they were endeavoring to clseI with&#xD;
him. The afrighted girl was placed in the coach and her protector&#xD;
follow ed. A shower of stones was sent after them, as the driver, putting&#xD;
the whip to his horses, drove off with his beat speed. The windows of&#xD;
the carriage were broken, but the persons inside fortunately escaped&#xD;
injury.&#xD;
The gentleman endeavored to soothe Adeline with assurances of her&#xD;
safety, but these assurances only increased her dismay. The voice&#xD;
was that of Mr. May berry, and the dread of being recognized by him&#xD;
was no less appalling to Adeline, than the danger from which she had&#xD;
just been delivered.&#xD;
It was Adeline's custom, when she went to make her weekly report&#xD;
to Ilickson, to dress in thme plainest manner, in order to avoid obser.&#xD;
vation as much as possible. In the simple garbs which she wore on the&#xD;
occasionto which we ,ow refer, Mr. Mayberry did not recognize her.&#xD;
He saw a woman ill-treated and his chivalric spirit prompted him to come&#xD;
to her rescue.&#xD;
Nothing could have been further from his thoughts, than any sus.&#xD;
picion that this woman, subjected to the insults of a low ruffian, in one&#xD;
of the least reputable quarters of the city, was Adeline Fosbenner,&#xD;
lately the object of his adoration. .Though there was something inex.-&#xD;
plicable in her recent conduct, which excited a feeling of distrust in his&#xD;
mind, he cou'd not imagine that she had fallen so low, as to become a&#xD;
forlorn wanderer through these discredited streets in the hours of&#xD;
darkness. .'&#xD;
He was, for reasons which the reader may guess, almost the last per.-&#xD;
son in the world, by whom Adeline would have wished to be recognized&#xD;
in the eircufhstances we have described. While she was in the carriage&#xD;
she did not venture to speak, lest the tones of her voice should beti ay&#xD;
her, and when they had, proceeded the length of a few blockgs, she sig..&#xD;
nified by a movement of her hand, that she wished to- get out. Mr.&#xD;
~Mayberry ordered the driver to stop, assisted Adeline to descend' the&#xD;
steps, and bade her good evening. She hurried away without making&#xD;
any reply, and the carriage drove off in another direction.&#xD;

On the following morning, at the hour appointed, Adeline who had&#xD;
passed another sleepless night, repaired to the house where she had&#xD;
passed the preceding afternoon, intending to plead illness as an excuse&#xD;
for not accompanying Bet and Sal on the proposed thieving excursion,&#xD;
for the risk of being seen in their company by some person who knew&#xD;
her, was so:obvious that even the dreaded anger -and resentment of&#xD;
Jlickson could not reconcile her to this expedition.&#xD;
When she entered the room where Bet and Sal generally sat, she&#xD;
found that they had a male visitor, whom she instantly discovered to&#xD;
be the same man, who had been punished by Mr. Mayberry, for mo-&#xD;
lcating her on the precedingsevening. A purple mark on his forehead&#xD;
-here the cihe had taken effect when he was felled to the earth, was&#xD;
very conspicuous, but could scarcely make the revolting and sinister&#xD;
expression of his countenance more remarkable.&#xD;
l1e evidently did not know her to be the same person, for whom he&#xD;
had suffered so severely, but as soon as .she came into the room she be-&#xD;
came the object of his undivided attention, and Sal who claimed him as&#xD;
an admirer of her own, was obviously enraged at the preference he&#xD;
discovered for the new-corer. In the course of the conversation, it&#xD;
appeared that the name of this unamiable young g man was Joe Bates,&#xD;
and that by profession be was a "knuck," but what that term signified&#xD;
Adeline was left to conjecture.&#xD;
Bet and Sal by the most contemptuous .treatment of Adeline, en-&#xD;
deavored to lower her in the estimation of Mr. Bates,,but it was too&#xD;
plain that he was. fascinated with her beauty, and the conduct of the&#xD;
envious young women gave him so much offence, that he d--d dhem&#xD;
for a couple of unrcvilized jades, adding some otner terms still more&#xD;
reproachful and concluded with the following speech:&#xD;
" I see this young lady has been in good society, and I'll bet drinks for&#xD;
the whole company, that she can -tell that I've enjoyed the same ad-&#xD;
vantage, for genteel people can read each other as easily as I can tell&#xD;
the Jack of Diamonds. Now, I tell you what it is, I'll not see a real&#xD;
.lady insulted by a pair of infernal dabs like you two, and if you think&#xD;
that I ever cared a d--n for either of. you, you're cursedly mistaken.&#xD;
Excuse me, Miss, (to Adeline,) for speaking to you without a regular intro-&#xD;
duction, seeing that nobody present has politeness enough to do the&#xD;
genteel thing and present me in due form; but my name is Joseph&#xD;
Bates, Esquire, and I'm the best knuck in New York City, nind blow&#xD;
me as high as Mount Atlas, if the first sight of you didn't penetrate me&#xD;
to .the very gizzard, (pardon me for the somewhat precipitate- decla-&#xD;
ration,) and if you'll condescend to hear my vows and reciprocate my&#xD;

THE NEW LOVER.--JELOUSY.&#xD;
&#xD;
affection, blast me if you shan't dress every day in silks and satins,&#xD;
and live on pound-cake and champaign, or whatever you like better,&#xD;
by-- and if that d.-.--d jackass Hickson, or any of his small-ware&#xD;
priggers, male or female, dares to interfere, I'll smash them by thunder.&#xD;
I have an appointment to meet some other gentlemen about this hour,.&#xD;
so I must bid you adieu for the present. When next we meet this bud&#xD;
of love may prove a beauteous flower. As for you, Sally Jones and&#xD;
Betsy lIoskins, I don't wish to say anything ungentlemanly to persons&#xD;
of the gentler sex, but I want you to take notice, that if this lady makes&#xD;
any complaints to me against either of you, I'll lick you as long as I can&#xD;
find a square inch of skin on your carcases to plant my fist on."&#xD;
having made this harangue, 1Pr. Bates stalked out of the room, and&#xD;
he had scarcely shut the door after him, before Bet and Sal assailed&#xD;
Adeline with a storm of abuse, which was kept up without intermission&#xD;
or abatement, until they had finished their preparations for the intended&#xD;
excursion among the. shops.. Adeline endeavoredto mollify their wrath&#xD;
by assuring them that she did not inteid to encourage the addresses of&#xD;
Mr. Bates, and that she would endeavor to avoid him in all time to&#xD;
come. The infuriated damsels were somewhat appeased ,with these&#xD;
assurances, and Adeline then ventured to beg them to go without her,,&#xD;
andto make the excuse that she was veryiill.&#xD;
"Very ill, are you-?" said Sal with a sardonic smile, "I wish I had'&#xD;
a chance to physic you. I'd let you see what it is to come between me&#xD;
and, my sweet-heart. You know Befrthe feller was as fond of, me, as&#xD;
if I was made all of maple sugar, till this cudfed trollope came along&#xD;
and tried to cut me out. D---n the hussy; I'll kill her if I have to&#xD;
hang.for it."&#xD;
The two confidential friends whispered together for some minutes..'&#xD;
The only words overheard by Adeline were, "it's a lucky chance that&#xD;
we can get rid of her any how; let'her slide." Bet then informed her&#xD;
that she might go, and that they would try to make all right with&#xD;
Hickson&#xD;
"But if he won't take your excuse," she added, "you and him must&#xD;
settle it between you."&#xD;
"Merciful heaven! where will this end?" though t A decline as she&#xD;
once more hurried homeward. " Would not a quiet dungeon be better&#xD;
than such a life of torturing suspense ? I cannot be more degraded&#xD;
than I am; I cannot despise myself more than I do now. I can never&#xD;
fall lower; why then .should I resist what is plainly my destiny? I&#xD;
see DOW that it is ignpossible to hide my guilt ; daily associatio-es with&#xD;
these wretches must lead to exposure. I will set Hickson-at. defiance.&#xD;

VISIT TO THE ENCHANTRESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
4'I&#xD;
&#xD;
Let him  do his worst. I cannot be more miserable than I am. But&#xD;
my fatherl I must not disgrace him, he could not survive it. If I am&#xD;
to be a thief I need not be a parricide. I will cease to be an inmate of&#xD;
his house; I will no longer be known by his name. Any home is good&#xD;
enough for one who stands in momentary dread of the State's Prison,&#xD;
any name is good enough for a criminal and an outcast. I will change&#xD;
my name, abandon my home, disconnect myself from my family, forget&#xD;
what I have been and reconcile myself to what I am."&#xD;
While these thoughts were passing through her mind, she chanced to,&#xD;
recollect 'a conversation, which she had once heard between .Bet and&#xD;
Sal, in which one of them spoke of a certain Jewess, who possessed the&#xD;
art of changing the complexion, the color of the hair, and other items&#xD;
of an individual's personal appearance, so that the person who under-&#xD;
went the transformation, could not be known to his or her most in- i&#xD;
timate friends.&#xD;
This skilful Jewess was in high repute with the thieves, counterfeiters,.&#xD;
house-breakers, pickpockets, and others of the same. dangerous class,&#xD;
for many of them had escaped detection by means of the metamorphoses'&#xD;
which the female Israelite had taught them how to make. When Ade-&#xD;
line heard the conversation aforesaid, it occurred to her, that by the&#xD;
aid of the Jewess, she might so disguise herself as to avoid the danger&#xD;
of recognition, while associating with the vicious people among whom&#xD;
her strange fortunes had thrown her. Fortunately, (as she thought,)&#xD;
she remembered the place mentioned by the girls, where the Jew woman&#xD;
was to be found, and she resolved to seek an interview with her, without.&#xD;
delay.&#xD;
Accordingly she proceeded to the cell of the Israelitish enchantress,&#xD;
which was situated in a small street near the East river. The woman.&#xD;
was called Mrs. Ramoth ; on enquiring for her by that name, Adeline was&#xD;
shown a small wooden house, painted red, with curtains of excessively&#xD;
gay calico at the windows and other symptons of the eccentric taste of&#xD;
the occupant.&#xD;
Mrs. Ramioth was a very corpulent lady,'with a decidedly Jewish&#xD;
physiognomy. She was showily dressed in a calico wrapper almost as&#xD;
flashy as the window curtains, and a profusion of'gold or gilded orna-&#xD;
ments on her per on. When Adelin~e had made known the object of&#xD;
her visit, Mrs. Ra oth promptly undertook to make her "so much not&#xD;
like vat she wash, dat her own muzzer would tink it wash ,somepody&#xD;
else."&#xD;
The price charged for this service was ten dollars, which Adeline&#xD;
promised to pay at her next visit, leaving a bracelet, (the fellow of her.&#xD;

frst gift to Uickson,) as a pledge for the fulfilment of ,biW ,bligation..&#xD;
Mrs. Ramoth then gave her several vials, one of which entdneI a wash&#xD;
for her face and hands, the second held a hair dye,. the their a prepar&#xD;
ration to obliterate moles, &amp;amp;c. She also instructed her how to iress im&#xD;
order to disguise her figure, and gave her advice with respect to her gait,&#xD;
the manner of carrying her head, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
Adeline was naturally of a very-fair complexion ; the wash given her&#xD;
by Mrs. Ramoth, was intended to give her skin a brown or swarthy&#xD;
hue ; the natural, color of her hair was a light chestnut ; Mrs. Ramoth&#xD;
:Formed her that the dye would change it to a jet black. The old.&#xD;
lady, moreover, gave her other directions, intended to make an apparent&#xD;
change even in the cast of her features and the expression of her counte-&#xD;
oance, indeed, the art of Mrs. Ramoth was almost miraculous, having&#xD;
been inherited from her Asiatic ancestors, some of whom l ad been among&#xD;
the most astonishing jugglers and wonder-workers of the East. Every&#xD;
thing having been provided for the intended transmutation, Adeline took&#xD;
leave of Mrs. Ramoth and proceeded homeward.&#xD;
On the following day, Adeline received the quarterly sum, which her&#xD;
father allowed her for the purchase of clothing, &amp;amp;c. This sum as we&#xD;
have stated elsewhere, was three hundred and seventy-five dollars. As&#xD;
roon as this money came into her possession,,.she made preparations for&#xD;
leaving her home, according to the resolution, which she had already&#xD;
formed. Part of her plan was to take boarding with Mrs. McFadden,&#xD;
And to improve the condition of her humble friend, by enabling her to&#xD;
hire more commodious apartments, and to furnish themz in a plain bud&#xD;
comfortable manner.&#xD;
A great part, of the day was spent in weeping and lamentation on&#xD;
account of the necessity, which drove her from the home of herbchild-&#xD;
hood, and it was almost night, when with ~a small package under her&#xD;
srm, containing a few simple articles of clothing, the daughter .of the&#xD;
"merchant prince''forsook the. superb residence of -her father, and&#xD;
sought to hide her guilt and shame in the obscurity of a hovel. But&#xD;
before she left her home forever, she deposited the following letter on&#xD;
L   her dressing table.'&#xD;
"Ay dearest Father. A dark cloud Irangs oyer me ; I cannot escape&#xD;
from the fury of the tempest. Believe me, that Iam more unfortunate&#xD;
than guilty, and let that thought conifort you for my absence. Oh ! my&#xD;
father, I know that I am about to- bring sotrow to your old age; but&#xD;
-sorrow may be borne,Adisgrace is insupportable. To save you from dis-&#xD;

iouse,, and to' hide. myself from the world. I cannot promise you that&#xD;
you will ever see me-again  Perhaps it is bette that you should not;&#xD;
for how could a man who detests every departure from probity and&#xD;
honor, endure the sight of a daughter, who deserves to be branded as a&#xD;
thief'?  Having written this I can never again appear in your presence;&#xD;
your reproving glance would blast me like the lightning of heaven.&#xD;
Pardon me if you can ;' I would ask you'to pray for me, if I hoped to&#xD;
deserve 'your prayers, but I am controlled by influences,'which must&#xD;
carry me beyond the reach of a father's blessing, and the benefit of his&#xD;
prayers.. To tell you more would only add to your sorrow, but I cannot&#xD;
take my last leave of you without letting you know; that wherever I am'&#xD;
and whatever I may become, you will be the first object of my thoughts,&#xD;
and the remembrance that I have grieved you, will always be my greatest&#xD;
affliction.&#xD;
Your wretched and unwoorthy child,&#xD;
.                A]hLIKE.'&#xD;
The events of the next two weeks, may be related in a very few&#xD;
words. Adeline having left her father's house, fixed her abode in the'&#xD;
humble dwelling of Mrs. McFadden. She had made use of Mrs. R-&#xD;
moth's assistance and transformed herself in such a manner, that she&#xD;
could venture abroad without much fear of being known by her former&#xD;
acquaintances&#xD;
She was cormipe     yickson's authority, which she dared not dis-&#xD;
pute, to assist Bet and Sal in storerobberies. When she went but in&#xD;
company with one or both of these girls, they would steal the goods and&#xD;
adroitly transfer tiem to Adeline's possession. It was her part of the&#xD;
duty to. take charge of the plunder, and with-a view to the promotion&#xD;
of this object, the practiced thieves caused their novice to wear dresses&#xD;
constructed especially for the purpose of concealing stolen articles. In&#xD;
this way, Adeline incurred more danger than her artful companions,&#xD;
although they were the active plunderers, for if the party had been sus-&#xD;
pected and searched, the goods would have been found on her, and the&#xD;
ether girls Would probably have disclaimed all knowledge of the&#xD;
matter.&#xD;
She was compelled. much against her inclinations, to pass some part&#xD;
of her time at the dwelling place of Bet and Sal. One day while she&#xD;
rwas assisting those girls in removing store-marks, &amp;amp;c., Joe Bates en-&#xD;
tered and agluted her with his usual gallantry, but scarcely vouchsafedd&#xD;

&#xD;
'i supercilous-nod to her two companions.: The attentions of this yoimi&#xD;
man, were amopg Adeline'a greatest annoyances. She seldom made any&#xD;
answer to his fine speeches,' or, took any ntice of his civility, but Jo&#xD;
seemed to think it imposible that she intended' to give him a serious&#xD;
repulse, for in his own opinion his fascinationswere irresistible.&#xD;
"Aha," said he, "I ,see old Ramoth has been at work on you. She&#xD;
could not spoil your beauty, only changed the style of it. You were&#xD;
formerly the most enchanting blonde in creation, now you are the most&#xD;
heart-breaking brunette."&#xD;
He then turned to Sal and ordered her in the most imperious tone to&#xD;
go to a neighboring "hotel " and buy him a pint of brandy.&#xD;
"And' don't think,' said he, " that I'm going to treat you or Bet'&#xD;
for you belong to the plebeian order, and I cannot compromise myself&#xD;
by drinking in your company. This angelic creature and myself, being&#xD;
of a more elevated and refined nature, will quaff the nectar together."&#xD;
For a moment, Sal's eyes gleamed with "pernicious fire, but with&#xD;
an effort she assumed an appearance of good humor, ,and taking ade-&#xD;
canter from the cupboard, she was about to proceed on her errand, but&#xD;
after opening the door, she closed it again and addressed her faithless&#xD;
lover:&#xD;
Joe, you are mistaken, if you think I'm troubled about you&#xD;
changing your mind. If you like Suke better than me, make much of&#xD;
her. I'd swap all the claim I've got on you, for a pair of shoe-&#xD;
strings."&#xD;
Mr. Bates answered only with a contemptuous smile, expressive of&#xD;
his unbelief that Sal. cculd give him up without a severe struggle.&#xD;
While she was gone after the brandy, he remarked that it was " d--d&#xD;
queer that a girl of that sort should mistake a few civil speeches for any&#xD;
thing more serious."&#xD;
Bet in defense of her absent friend remarked:&#xD;
"Joe Bates we all know that you are a deceiver. It's the way with&#xD;
all you handsome fellers. You don't know your own minds for two&#xD;
days together. Suke will soon find you out."&#xD;
YHere Mr. Bates laid his right hand on his bosom, andgave Adelins&#xD;
a glance expressive of unalterable affection. Had she been at alln&#xD;
sible of the ludicrous, she mst have smiled at this pantomimic display of&#xD;
his feelings. But Adeline was never known to smile after the fatal da~&#xD;
when her first crime was committed, 'and her life of servitude aind&#xD;
suffering commenced.'''&#xD;
Sal soon returned with the liquor, an d placed a dlecanter and&#xD;
two wine glasses on a table, between Adehne and Joseph B~ates.&#xD;

Taa MURpER.&#xD;
The. ardent lover poured out a bumper of the fiery liquid and&#xD;
urged her to drink, but she positively declined the offe.ng, at&#xD;
which he seemed to be very much surprised and a little offended&#xD;
He consoled himself however by drinking glass after glass of the un-&#xD;
diluted liquor.&#xD;
Soon, however, some unpleasant thought seemed to force itself&#xD;
on his mind, and he held a glass of the brandy in his hand and tasted&#xD;
the fluid deliberately.&#xD;
"This stuff," said he, "has a deuced queer taste. Sal, it strikes&#xD;
ne that you must have put bitters in it. Eh ! did you not."&#xD;
"Yes," answered Sal with a burst of ferocious rage, "you've got&#xD;
your bitters youfalse-hearted rascal, and all that I'm sorry for is that&#xD;
your new fancy-gal didn't get hers."_&#xD;
"«What do you mean ?" said Bates, turning .as pale as the deeply-&#xD;
dyed crimson of his complexion would admit of. " What have you&#xD;
been doing with the brandy."_&#xD;
Only put an ounce of strychnine in it," answered Sal, " and if&#xD;
you've any account to settle-in this world, the sooner you get about it&#xD;
the better.".&#xD;
"Yes, I've one account to setttle," replied Bates, as he drew a&#xD;
pistol from his bosom and fired at Sal across the table. The ball&#xD;
entered her bosom and she seemed about'to fall, but Bet supported her&#xD;
in her arms.&#xD;
"Ydu've killed me for nothing after: all," said the dying girl,&#xD;
"I only put a little extract of tansy in your drink meaning to&#xD;
frighten you. Make your escape, Joe. I don't wish you to be hanged&#xD;
on my account. If yo- had killed that gal too, I. should have been&#xD;
satisfied. My curse upon her! it's all owing to her that I'm cut off in&#xD;
my sins."&#xD;
A stream of blood poured from her mouth and stopped her&#xD;
utterance. The murderer without waiting to see the final result of&#xD;
his deed rushed from the house, but scarcely soon enough to avoid&#xD;
a police officer, who hoard the report of the pistol and. quickly made&#xD;
Disappearance at the tragic scene. After~ a few spasmodic movements&#xD;
the wounded girl expired.&#xD;
Tlhe officer arrested Adeline and Bet, the only persons found in the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

t&#xD;

&#xD;
"WOMAN KILLED. A young woman named Sarah Jones, was&#xD;
shot about nine o'clock last night, by some person- unknown, at a&#xD;
house of suspicious character in Star Alley. She died almost immel&#xD;
diately. Two girls named Betsy iloskins and Susan Baker, who&#xD;
are supposed to have some knowledge of the murder were arrested and&#xD;
will have a hearing this morning."&#xD;
Who that had any acquaintance with Adline Fosbenner, could&#xD;
have imagined that she and the "Susan Baker " mentioned in the&#xD;
foregoing paragraph, were one and .the same person? At the In-&#xD;
quest, she and Bet gave in their evidence, but the murderer could&#xD;
notbe found, and as the victim was a person of little note, not much&#xD;
search was made after the criminal.&#xD;
The wretchedness of Adeline was increased, if possible by thiB&#xD;
tragic event. The "dying curse which had been pronounced against&#xD;
her, constantly rang in her ears. Though she was really not charge-&#xD;
able with any participation in the murder, her morbid fancy made&#xD;
it appear that she was guilty; for, (to follow her own reasoning,) if&#xD;
she had not committed her first theft, sho would not have been&#xD;
thrown into the company of Bates and Sarah Jones, and then the&#xD;
former would not have become a murderer, and the latter would not&#xD;
have been murdered.&#xD;
Such reflections made her more desperate. than ever.  She felt&#xD;
that she should never enjoy peace of mind again, and this assurance&#xD;
made her more reckless in pursuing the course of ife, which fate, as&#xD;
she supposed, had ordained her to follow. Shosoon began to-find some&#xD;
relief in the excitement of pilfering, and for some weeks she engaged&#xD;
in it with i sort of phrenzied enthusiasm.&#xD;
But another change came over her. The truth is, perhaps, that&#xD;
the phrenzy, the moral insanity, which had possessed her, began to&#xD;
abate. Suddenly she became scrupulously conscientious. She wept&#xD;
for -her past deeds and prayed for heavenly assistance to preserve her&#xD;
from future sins'of the same kind.&#xD;
In the meanwhile her health was seriously affected; she had fre-&#xD;
quent and violent pains in the breast, fainting fits and other symptoms&#xD;
which physicians suppose to indicate " disease of the heart."&#xD;
The experiment of changing her personal appearance, under Mrs.&#xD;
Ramoth's directions, was so successful and her disconnection from.&#xD;
her family and former acquaintances was so complete, that the gxieat&#xD;
object of her dread, identification and, disgrace, was in a great measure&#xD;
obviated.&#xD;

58                   MURDER OF HIC8ON.&#xD;
.If arrested under her assumed name and. altered appearance, she&#xD;
thought she might he tried, sentenced and imprisbned without' being&#xD;
known as Adeline Fosbenner, and so long as her. family name was&#xD;
concealed, the legal punishment to which she was liable, seemed to be&#xD;
nore desirable than otherwise, as she believed that imprisonment would&#xD;
be more tolerable than'her present condition.&#xD;
She was therefore prepared to throw off the iron rule of s ickson,&#xD;
ja nd she resolved to do so, at the next interview with her tyrant.&#xD;
When he made his next call to demand the' produce of her ''week's&#xD;
work," she had nothing to give him.&#xD;
He reproached her in the bitterest terms. She heard 'him with&#xD;
apparent indifference, ie attempted to influence her by a repetition&#xD;
of -his former threats, but she was still unmoed and plainy in-&#xD;
forined him, that nothing would ever induce her t steal any more.&#xD;
During this altercation, Mrs. McFadden was 'employed in cooking&#xD;
her supper.  She had listened with increasing Wrath to the abusive&#xD;
language which Hickson applied to Adeline.. But the affair was&#xD;
now reaching a climax. Adeline whose patience, for a long time,&#xD;
teemed to withstand 'every provocation, had made no reply to the&#xD;
Villain's 'scurrilous -language, but at length,-she seemed to' be aroused,&#xD;
and in- a somewhat defiant tone, repeated her declaration that she&#xD;
would never steal again.&#xD;
This excited Hickson's rage to such a degi-ee that he struck her,&#xD;
e and was about to repeat the blow, when Mrs. McFadden interposed&#xD;
nd received the blow on her own person.  ith no very light hand,&#xD;
she returned it, and the cowardly ruffian drew' a dirk or dagger,&#xD;
ahid made a thrust at Mrs. McFadden, who grasped the "skillet,''&#xD;
a cooking utensil of solid metal, *hich she had just been using, and&#xD;
While- Hickson stiil pressed 'on her with'the dagger, she dealt a well-&#xD;
directed blow with the -skillet, at. the caitiff's 'head, and as the Irish&#xD;
woman's strength 'was prodigious Hickson's skull was crushed by the&#xD;
stroke.&#xD;
ieT snk on his knees, the bl od streaming from  the terrific gash&#xD;
and ;his -limbs quivering with -the convulsions of death; but he&#xD;
truggled to recover his feet, and actually rose once more to a standing&#xD;
position, presenting one' of the most frightful spectacles that thought&#xD;
can conceive, throwing out his arms and' clutching at his head, which&#xD;
asan indisdn guishable niss- of blood and carnage so completely-&#xD;
hady it been derhiolished by the forced of' the woman's ar~m and the&#xD;
N~eight of the instrumentn. At length he sank on-'thie" floor, an&#xD;

Her two children had, been screaming   ith all&#xD;

sound in a house inhabited by several Irish families,&#xD;

Adeline was the first to recover self-possession.&#xD;

"Go," said she, "take passage in some vessel; esca&#xD;
stop not a moment or it will be too late."&#xD;
" Sure," said Mrs. McFadden, "I cannot go w&#xD;
trouble. must come let us share it between us.&#xD;
"Think not of me," answered Adeline, "I am&#xD;
of yourself; think of your children. When you gel&#xD;

Mrs. McFadden, bewildered and irresolute, was fi&#xD;
of the house by Adeline, who had hastily equipped hex&#xD;
a' ind shawl. The children followed their mother, and&#xD;
the whole party from the window, till they were out&#xD;

of the room was absent,..while the man received his fatal injuries ot&#xD;
her premises.  Adeine wished to produce this impression, and shyG&#xD;
said nothing to correct the error, as she ,had determined, no. matter&#xD;
At what hazard to herself, to shield Mrs. McFadden from danger.&#xD;
In .answer to enquiries made by officers of the law and others, who&#xD;
soon gatheredin the room,,Adeline said:&#xD;
"You see as much as, 1 do, judge for yourselves. You will not ob-&#xD;
taii any information from me."&#xD;
Such - answers -of course, were calculated to fasten suspicion on&#xD;
herself. ,In fact, she was taken into custody and after a short hearing&#xD;
was fully committed to answer the charge of murder, as lickson was&#xD;
uite dead before the arrival of the surgeon.&#xD;
Leaving her in prison, and in danger of being convicted of the&#xD;
highest crime punishable by human laws, we must now take notice.&#xD;
of some prior transactions, an account of which will: be.necessary to er&#xD;
plain the following pages of this narrative..&#xD;
Ever since Adeline's disappearance from her home, the nost.diligent&#xD;
search had been made after the lpst daughter. Her brother had&#xD;
been summoned from college to assist in this search, and Mr. Charles.&#xD;
Mayberry engaged with equal zeal and activity in the same duty, but&#xD;
all their efforts were unrewarded with success.&#xD;
The letter which Adeline had left on her dressing table, convinced&#xD;
her friends that her mind was disordered. In that letter 'she had&#xD;
charged herself with theft.&#xD;
Her relatives thought it impossible that she could have comipitted&#xD;
such a crime while' in possession of her senses. :They believed that&#xD;
her gudt was imaginary, a creation of her own mind under the in&#xD;
uence of melancoly insanity. But her interview with the strange&#xD;
man i1, Umion Square, and the control which he, evidently had over&#xD;
her, might have made, them suspect that there was-so e truth in her&#xD;
self-accusation. Yet any one might be excused for doubting that a&#xD;
young lady, who. like .Adeline, duly estimated her, soni. position, and&#xD;
indeed was proud of it, a young lady, who enjoyed all the comforts&#xD;
apd luxuries, .hich wealth. a afford, could be. tempted to, commit&#xD;
the most despicable and degrading of all crime, uness. she Was in-&#xD;
fuenced by some species of insanity. ..&#xD;
When Mr. Fosbenner assisted~ liy his son and Charles 'Mayberry had:&#xD;
continued his search after Adln for.neorly'two months, without aiy&#xD;
prospect of successs, he determined t~o call ora. me for counsel, as 1&#xD;
had gained some notoriety by prosecuting a, somewhat .similar search,&#xD;
severall years before, and my~god fortune 9n. that occasion, made the&amp;amp;&#xD;

three gentleman hope,' that I might 'be equally sucessful in the present&#xD;
instance.&#xD;
Accordingly they came to my rooms one morning, and stated all the&#xD;
circumstances of the case. At my request they furnished me with a&#xD;
written description of Adeline's personal appearance, and in the course&#xD;
of conversation, the last letter written by her .to 'her father happening&#xD;
to be 'mentioned, I desiredto see it, and as  Mr. Fosbenner had it with&#xD;
him, it was instantly produced. . I gazed at.the writing-for some minutes,&#xD;
satisfied that I had seen a similar manuscript before, 'but in what circun-&#xD;
stances I could not immediately recollect. Suddenly I remembered the&#xD;
note purporting tocome from some girl,'living in Church Street, who&#xD;
desired to have my advice. As I had put that note on file, I now brought&#xD;
it but and compared it with the: letter;, whidh, had just been handed' to&#xD;
me by Mr. Fosbenner. The writing was identical." On that point there&#xD;
could be no mistake ; for, as I remarked once before, the .beauty and&#xD;
feminine' grace of the chirography, surpassed everything of'the -kind,&#xD;
that I had ever beheld,&#xD;
"I think, at- least, it is possible," said Ito Mr. Fosbenner, "that&#xD;
I have some clue to the whereabouts of your daughter. There may&#xD;
e some mistake in the matter, however, and I advise you not to be too&#xD;
sanguine in your expectations. If 'you and these. other gentlemen will&#xD;
accompany me, we may soon ascertain whether my conjectures con-&#xD;
cerning her present place 'of abode are correct or otherwise."&#xD;
They all gladly consented to go With nre without delay,: Accordingly&#xD;
I conducted them -to the iouse in Church Street which had been deilig-&#xD;
n'ated in the note I had received, as the place to which an answer might&#xD;
be addressed'. When we arrived at the spot, it appeared to'be the scene&#xD;
of some confusion. Groups of people stood 'on the pavement, hear the&#xD;
door and even in the entry, apparently engaged in discussing some sib&#xD;
ject of general interest. 'I surmised from this circumstance, 'that soine:&#xD;
thing extraordinary had occurred at "the 'place.  We iade our way&#xD;
through these knots 'of debaters, to a room on  the first floor, from which&#xD;
the furniture had been removed'and two stout women,  with a tub of 'hot&#xD;
water between them, were engaged in scrubirig alarge' space in the&#xD;
boards, which appeared to have been stained with blond. Glancing: at&#xD;
my companions, I- observed that: they were very much affected, and' in-&#xD;
deed, greatly alarmed at this 'spectacle. I addressed myself civilly 'to&#xD;
one of the women, and 'aked:&#xD;

pausing frogher work, with the scrubbing brush in her hand, as if quite&#xD;
'willing to prolong the conversation. "They kilt a man"Aamong them&#xD;
and then put out. 'They were a bad'set I warrant you."&#xD;
"Was the name of ,the tenant, Mrs. McFadden-?"&#xD;
"Sure enough it was. I live on the third floor, and many's the tme&#xD;
I've seen her, bad luck to her, for a bloody-minded haythen."&#xD;
"«Had she any family ?"&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, she had, two childer; and very pretty ones I must&#xD;
allow, although their mother was a she Bizebtb."&#xD;
"Was there anybody else living with her ?"&#xD;
" Ay !'she had a boarder."&#xD;
"Man or woman'?"&#xD;
" A girl, and a very good-looking one-tco and she's the very one that&#xD;
killed ould Ilickson.".&#xD;
"Do you know her name."&#xD;
"Very likely she had a dozen names to suit her convaynience, but&#xD;
Bet Hoskins, her crony, told me that her common name was Suke Baker."&#xD;
I now remembered that the. initials mentioned in the note, to which&#xD;
my ,answer was to be addressed, were S. B. So far' we seemed to be;&#xD;
on the right track. As the woman seemed to like the subject and gas&#xD;
waiting for more questions, I asked:&#xD;
"Was not this Suke Baker of a light complexion ?"&#xD;
"Divil a bit, she was as brown as a bunn."&#xD;
"Her hair was of a light brown ?" said I..&#xD;
"No, it was as black as ink, ,or her own heart, may the divil con-&#xD;
found her."&#xD;
This intelligence afforded the gentlemen who were with me great&#xD;
relief. In fact they were now certain that 'the girl we ,bad been en.-&#xD;
qiring after, could not be Adeline. But I was not quite satisfied on&#xD;
this subject and I ihow remembered a paragraph, which had appeared&#xD;
in the papers of the preceding day, and in which it was stated'that&#xD;
Susan Baker had been committed on the charge of murdering John&#xD;
Hickson. It occurred to me that by visiting this Susan Baker in prison,&#xD;
we could easily ascertain whether she was or was 'not the person we&#xD;
sought. lMy oompanion&amp;amp;,Shough they bielieved that I was on~ the wrorg&#xD;
trail, readily agreed to accompany me to the prison. On our arrival&#xD;
there, my professional character enabled ue~to obtain permission to see&#xD;
the prisoner, and we were conducted by one of the keepers to her&#xD;
apartment. On entering we ;saw a young girl reclining in pensive&#xD;
attitude on a settee ; her hair was dishevelled 'an'd partly concealed her&#xD;
face, and she seemed tot be so much abeorbed in her own reflections,&#xD;

that our entrance was unnoticed. I looked at Mr. Fosbenner and the&#xD;
two other gentlemenn, but could see rio signs of recognition. Then I&#xD;
began to suspect that I was really mistaken in the whole matter, but ink&#xD;
order to obtain a view of the' girl's face, I repeated the name by which&#xD;
she had been committed:&#xD;
" Susan Baker."&#xD;
She looked up, uttered a scream or rather a cry of agony and then&#xD;
covered her face with both hands.&#xD;
"cThat is not my daughter "said Mr. Fosbenner in a low tone, "her&#xD;
appearance is totally different."&#xD;
Frederick and Charles Mayberry, however, looked at her with earnest&#xD;
scrutiny. Her disguise perplexed them for a moment, but after ert.&#xD;
changing a glance with each other, they simultaneously exclaimed:&#xD;
" It is Adeline, it is my sister."&#xD;
The elder Mr. Fosbenner hastily advanced, took her hand, gently ro,&#xD;
moved it from her face, and after gazing on her features, cried:&#xD;
" It is indeed my poor child. Thank God that we have found her.&#xD;
Speak to me my daughter. Fear nothing, all is forgiven. (some to&#xD;
my arms, anaslet us once more be happy. Come with me, you have been&#xD;
too long in this horrid place. Speak, for heavens's sake,,speak to me."&#xD;
She had swooned. The paleness of death was on her countenance..&#xD;
The exclamations of grief and alarm uttered by Mr. Fosbenner, brought&#xD;
several persons into the room. The keeper's wife chafed Adeline's tem-&#xD;
ples and used other means to restore her. A physician who happened&#xD;
to be visiting at the. prison was called into the apartment. lie ex-&#xD;
amined her condition and, remarked:&#xD;
"This girl is suffering under'cardial disease ; you should excteher as&#xD;
little as possible. Violent emotions in such cases as hers are dangerous."&#xD;
After some time, Adeline was restored"to consciousness, She grasped&#xD;
Mr. Fosbenner's hand in both of her owyn and exclaimed:&#xD;
" Oh ! my father, what have you done!. I hoped to suffer and die&#xD;
without 'being known, but you have deprived me of that last consolation.&#xD;
Disgrace is now certain, it will fall on our whole family. By what&#xD;
dreadful mischance did you discover my secret?  In little time I&#xD;
should have been safe, safe in a dungeon, and the name of Adeline Fos-&#xD;
bonner would 'never have been coupled with infamy. 'But new all will&#xD;
be 'known, and death itself will not shield me from that share, which I&#xD;
feared more than imprisonment, torture or any punishment, which the&#xD;
eruelty and injustice of men, can inflict on me."&#xD;
" Do not reproach~ me, my dan.ghter," said Mr. Foshenner,e deeply&#xD;
.fected, "I have indeed done wrong, but my anxiety on yorr amount&#xD;

your real name shall not be known in connection with these troubles.&#xD;
Compose yourself, my best beloved, and your friends will take care that*&#xD;
no disgrace .shall attach itself to you, for they know that ybu do not,&#xD;

The, physician'observing that the presence of Adeline's relatives kept'&#xD;
her in a state. of egcesgive agitation, advised them to withdraw. The&#xD;
room was soon clearec'of every person except the prisoner, the physician.&#xD;
and nyaelf. Ve soothed: her with the mntle language of sympathy,&#xD;
and when I made myself known to her and promised her with confidence,&#xD;
thatI could bring her through all her troubles, that I had in fact; been&#xD;
engaged by her father to advise and befriend her in this emergency&#xD;
she voluntarily. gave me: an account of her sufferings, her temptations,,&#xD;
her sins and repentance. The narrative was interrupted by many tears:&#xD;
and sobs, and I observed that she seemed disposed to magnify her own&#xD;
errors, rather than to conceal or excuse them.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, Mr. Fosbenner accomipanied by his son and Charles.&#xD;
Mayberry, visited the offices of the different newspapers, and the olds&#xD;
merchant by liberal donations, induced the publishers to suppress aP&#xD;
accounts of the identification of Susan Baker, with Adeline Fosbenner,-,&#xD;
which might be furnished by their reporters, several of. whom were&#xD;
known to have been in the apartment of the prison, wherehsdert&#xD;
fication took place.&#xD;
But one paper, a weekly sheet of detestable character, was overlooked&#xD;
The news collectors of that sheet had-been' among the crowd, whichin5&#xD;
traded into the room and witnessed the affecting meeting between father&#xD;
and daughter, which wne' havei.described. This scandal-monger ein&#xD;
ployed himself through the whole day, in endeavoring to trace the his.;&#xD;
tory of Adeline, during her'  absence frpm her father's house. He ob-&#xD;
tained very little information on that subject, but his depraved fancy&#xD;
supplied all deficiency of facts. According to the customs of his tribe,&#xD;
he perverted and aggravated everything that bore any resemblance to&#xD;
truth, and by adding much that wa absolute y false, he contrived to&#xD;
make' out a story and earn the wages of iniq ity on which he lived,&#xD;
The paper containig this monstrous tissue of f1~sehoods, was published&#xD;
the next ,morning, and- a copy of it was brought by the keeper's wiff&#xD;
into the room of thie prison where Adeline was confined. This woman&#xD;
afterwards declared 'that the article relating to the prisoner had 1geex&#xD;
overlooked by her,, and that when she carried in Adehine'a breakfast, shq&#xD;
took the paper also, withithe hope that the melaiwholy girl might find&#xD;

SHE PROVES TO n3E A GIRL OF WEALTH AND FASHION I1&#xD;
DISTRESS OF HER FAMILY! !!!&#xD;
Adeline snatched the paper with 'a convulsive grasp and read on, every&#xD;
word no doubt striking her with the force and effect of a poisoned arrow.&#xD;
"Our chief reporter, a gentleman of untiring industry, in his profession; waa en-&#xD;
gaged through nearly the whole of yesterday in collecting the facts, which we now,&#xD;
lay before our fifty thousand readers, facts more extraordinary and astonishing&#xD;
than ever were detailed in the pages of romwnce.&#xD;
"The girl who was committed for thema.,-ker of John Hickson in Church street,&#xD;
last-Wednesday, and who has passed under the name of Susan Baker, proves to be&#xD;
Adeline Fosbenner, a fashionable belle, very beautiful, but infinitely depraved, who&#xD;
has been for a long time, secretly pursuing a.course of life, unsurpassed in'the an-&#xD;
nals of crime. She-a has employed herself for years in stealing jewelry and other,&#xD;
valuables, although the. wealth of her father, placed her out of the reach of tempta-&#xD;
tion to commit thefts, unless it was done for amusement, or innate love of wicked-'&#xD;
ness: some months ago, she became acquainted with John Hickson, a poor but&#xD;
honest man, who kept a junk..shop in Anthony Street, and sihe induced this Hick-&#xD;
sn by various false hoods, to sell the articles she had stolen, and to take a share of&#xD;
the;proceeds, making the simpleand unsuspicious man believe that the goods came&#xD;
honestly into her possession. She also persuaded two friendless young women,&#xD;
Sarah Jones and'Elizabeth uHskins, to accompany her o' her walks among the&#xD;
shops, and endeavoredto make them assist her-inher thieving operations, but they&#xD;
refused .to do so, and abandoned her company as sooin-as they became acquainted&#xD;
with her character andhabits. At this time, Susan BakeraliasAceline Fosbenner&#xD;
was the kept mistress of a notorious pickpock#*,named Joe Bates and she left her&#xD;
father's house and forsook the fashionable society, to which she had so long been&#xD;
accustomed, in order to carry on her intriguewith Bateswitlhout interruption from'&#xD;
her family. But becoming jealous on account of some attentions paid by Bates to&#xD;
Sarah Jones;,who was unacquai ted with his real character, Susan, tia Adeline,&#xD;
induced her paramour to shoot the innocent and unfortunate girl. In accordance&#xD;
with this devilish suggestion, Bates did shoot Sarah Jones with a pistol, and killed&#xD;
her on the spot.' Helted from justice; and his female instigator also, in some way&#xD;
that we cannot understand,escaped punishment/&#xD;
"Bysome means, Mr; Hickson discovered that the jewels he had sold for the girl:&#xD;
Fosbenner, alas Baker, were stolenproperty. tie went to the place where she&#xD;
boarded, and charged -her with the fact, exhorting her toamenI her wicked course&#xD;
of life, which so enraged the she-demon, that with the assistance of her friendand&#xD;
complice, an Irish woman named McFadden, she beat IHickson to death with an&#xD;

the law, but su'elytrno c ourt r'jr r ill hv h  h=lardihotod to cutt4ms&#xD;

bribing th press to silence, his efforts were directed to having her re&#xD;
noved to her home. My assistance was now required to effect this ob-&#xD;
jet, which wa 'tended with some. difficulty, as murder, in general, is&#xD;
not a bailable .oe ce. But wealth can- accornlish much in this cit.&#xD;
By offering security to a large amount, accompanied by evidence, that&#xD;
she was laboring under aberration of intellect, we obtained the power to&#xD;
take her from prison, and to place her under the affectionate care of her&#xD;
own family. By the wa   it should be remarked that none of us be-&#xD;
lieved that she h ad anything to do with the murder" of Hickson. There&#xD;
was no evidence to convict her of that crime, and in fact scarcely at y&#xD;
ground for suspicion. If the case should come to a trial, I had no.&#xD;
doubt of her acquittal.&#xD;
On the next morning after our first visit to her prison, her father,&#xD;
brother, Mr. Mayberry and myself, went in. Mr. Fosbenner's family&#xD;
carriage to remove her from that abode of gloom and sorrow to her&#xD;
proper dwelling place. We tapped at Adeline's door and receiving no&#xD;
answer    r. Fosbenner and his son gently entered the room; Mr. May-&#xD;
Ferry and I remaining without, for fear of startling her by the sudden&#xD;
appearance of so many persons. Soon after we heard the wildest ex-&#xD;
clamations of grief and anguish' from her father and brother. Mr.&#xD;
Mayberry and I rushed into the apartment. Adeline was still reclining&#xD;
on the settee, her head resting against the back rail ; a newspaper was&#xD;
'clutched in lher hand ; her eyes were fixed and glassy, he!' form motion-&#xD;
less, in short'she was dead, quite dead. The false and scurrilous pub-&#xD;
lication she had just read, co-operating with the disease, under which she&#xD;
labored,  d terminated her earthly existence and placed her forever&#xD;
beyond th   ach of human kindness or human wrongs.&#xD;
The sad story is told. My object :n this publicatioaisto do all the&#xD;
justice that is possible to the deceased. The cruel newspaper slander,&#xD;
which was the immediate cause of; Adeline Fosbenner's -death, had cir-&#xD;
culation enough to mislead the judgment of many persons, with regard.&#xD;
to her real character, and in this way her mnemorfr has .been exposed to&#xD;
more 'obloquy than it- deserved. In the statement of authentic facts&#xD;
which I have given, I have viihdicated her from unmerited reproach, with-&#xD;
out attempting to conceal any of the errors or sins which she really&#xD;
committed. -Whether a~ was more unfortunate than guilty, let the&#xD;
reader now judge.&#xD;
