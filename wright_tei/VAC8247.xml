"~THE ESCRITOIRE.&#xD;
"THE author, being a resident of New York during the period&#xD;
of the leading incidents narrated; as occurring in that city, had&#xD;
formed the acquaintance of the principal personage. Himself&#xD;
a Southerner, he had, from the natural affinities of origin, inev-&#xD;
itably been attracted toward Carter. The intercourse between&#xD;
them, at first reserved,,chad imperceptibly warmed into a degree&#xD;
of, intimacy, which, however, had by no means been sucb as to&#xD;
render him at all- cognisant. beyond the merest generalities, of&#xD;
the progress of his, private -affiairs. He was not a little  surprised,&#xD;
therefore, at finding, one day, an elegant escritoire ,r cabinet,&#xD;
of dark, rich wood, heavily banded;in. the old-fashioned style&#xD;
with silver, which ha been. place4Y in his absence, on the .table&#xD;
of his sanctum.. A-note, in a sealed envelope, lay upon it. He&#xD;
instantly recognised the handwriting of the address as that of&#xD;
Mr. Carter, and broke the seal.&#xD;

"It was evidently written in great haste, but without any siga&#xD;
of trepidation. It ran thus.:-&#xD;
"MY DEAR FRIEND :&#xD;
"I have no time for explanations, as I am in the midst of&#xD;
hurried preparations for an unexpected yacht-voyage -upon&#xD;
wh Iset sail in a few'minutes. I send you an escritoire,&#xD;
which was left in my charge by a highly valued friend. He&#xD;
was an extraordinary man; and its contents will be, I doubt&#xD;
not, of great value to the world.&#xD;
"It was ,given me, with the injunction that it should not be&#xD;
opened until six months after his death. The six months were&#xD;
up some weeks since, but I have lately been too much otherwise&#xD;
absorbed to think of making use of the privilege of the key.&#xD;
I now therefore transfer to you this bequest in full, with the&#xD;
proviso that you will not open it for six months. - If at the end&#xD;
of that time I have not been heard from, please open, and with-&#xD;
out reserve make what use of it your excellent sense may justify'&#xD;
Please take charge of whatever correspondence may arrive to&#xD;
my address for the same length of time, at the expiration of&#xD;
which you will also please to consider yourself as my ex-&#xD;
ecutor-open my correspondence and proceed as .you may&#xD;
think best. Pardon this unceremonious intrusion of responsi-&#xD;
bilities upon an intimacy, the terms of which I hardly feel would&#xD;
strictly justify me ; but the plea that I know no one else whom&#xD;
I can trust, and have no time for further explanation, gill I am,&#xD;
sure justify me in the eyes of a brother Southron.&#xD;

INTRODUCTION.                 6&#xD;
&#xD;
"Six months having elapsed, and still no news of my singular&#xD;
friend Carter, the fulfilment, of the important duties of executor,&#xD;
thus unexpectedly devolved upon him, were deferred by the&#xD;
narrator as long as his sense of duty would possibly admit. At&#xD;
last, when longer delay would have seemed to assume almost&#xD;
the aspect of criminality, the duty of opening the cabinet was&#xD;
unwillingly entered upon."&#xD;
On my next meeting with my friend Carter, who proved still&#xD;
to be in the land of the living, I spoke to him of the cabinet&#xD;
and its remarkable contents, which had so unexpectedly been&#xD;
left in my charge ; offering to resign to him my trusteeship.&#xD;
To this, however, he would by no means consent, but continued&#xD;
to insist, as in his original letter, that I should without reserve&#xD;
make what use of it my sense of propriety might dictate. I&#xD;
was finally overruled into undertaking the mere arrangement&#xD;
and editorship of its contents-for the revelations there made are&#xD;
in many. respects so strangely horrifying and unusual, that I fear&#xD;
the world will be, little disposed to pardon my agency in giving&#xD;
them publicity. However, as I believe them to be, in every&#xD;
respect, genuine life-experiences, I have determined to make&#xD;
the venture, come what will of it.. We shall therefore give, as&#xD;
proper introduction to the singular' narrative which we have&#xD;
selected from beneath the blood-stained seals of The cabinet it&#xD;
has been our fate to open, the following singular paper, which&#xD;
we -found lying separately above the folds of the MS. which&#xD;
constitutes the History of Etherial Softdown.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE PIIILOSOPHY OF MESMERIC IMPOSITION.&#xD;
TO  E READ BY PHILOSOPHERS ONLY.*&#xD;
THE existence of what may be called the nervous or odic&#xD;
luiid--the sympathetic element-has been partially known to all&#xD;
ages. The knowledge of this powerful secret, in moving and&#xD;
controlling mankind, has been professionally and almost exclu-&#xD;
sively confined to the adepts of all sects, religions, and periods;&#xD;
though it has occasionally, in various ways, leaked out of the&#xD;
penetralia, principally through its forms, accompanied with&#xD;
little or no apprehension. of their vital - meaning.  It is in&#xD;
this way that a series of scientific"phenomena, the discovery&#xD;
of which probably originated with a remote priestcraft, and&#xD;
had been made to subserve exclusive' ends, has gradually been&#xD;
fragmented among the people, and in many imperfect, ignorant,&#xD;
and vitiated forms has now become the comnion property of&#xD;
science.&#xD;
When it is understood that this nervous fluid is nothing more&#xD;
nor less than that force-whether electrical, magnetic, odic, or&#xD;
otherwise named-- which, lubricating the nervous system in&#xD;
man,- produces all vital phenormena -is, in a word, the vital&#xD;
force -the active principle of life -it will not be difficult to&#xD;
comprehend' how important a knowledge of its laws may be&#xD;
rendered to even those relations of life not exclusively physical.&#xD;
Mesmer promulgated, under his own name, as a new and&#xD;
Lstounding discovery in science, something of the sympathetic&#xD;
laws to which this nervous or Odic fluid is- subject, and by&#xD;
* The Story begins at Chapter I.-En.&#xD;
&#xD;
which the vital 'and spiritual relations of man to the external&#xD;
universe are in a great measure modified, and even controlled.&#xD;
This was no discovery of his, but had been the mainly&#xD;
exclusive secret of the ancient priesthood; employed alike in&#xD;
the ceremonies. of the novitiate in the Thibetian temples of&#xD;
Buddha, in the Egyptian Initiation, and in Grecian Pythisin.&#xD;
But, the particular reason why his announcements caused such&#xD;
prodigious excitement, in 1784, .as to run all Paris mad, even&#xD;
including the court of the wary Louis XVL, and stillbcontinue&#xD;
to excite and madden mankind, is, that, as the sympathetic&#xD;
ecstacies and furors, superinduced by the mummeries of :his&#xD;
famous "vat," were- called by a-new name, the people failed to&#xD;
recognise them, although they had been famiiarised with, and&#xD;
even acting habitually under their influence, while surrounded&#xD;
by accessories of, a more" sacred character. The immediate&#xD;
success, of Mesmer's experiments amazed men. He, in fact,&#xD;
little knew what he was doing himself; the effects he, under-&#xD;
stood how to produce, because accident had furnished him with&#xD;
the formulas. Having gone through these, which, though most&#xD;
grotesque and preposterous, later experience has shown, really&#xD;
included all the "passes" and other conditions necessary to&#xD;
establish sympathy through the nervous fluid with the victims&#xD;
of his delusion, he proceeded to produce -.exhibitions the most&#xD;
extraordinary the world ever saw, except in the hideous and&#xD;
frantic orgies of some wild, barbaric creed, and the parallels- to&#xD;
which, in this country, are to be found in the shrieks and bel-&#xD;
lowings of a fanatic camp-meeting, Miller ascension.tent, Mor-&#xD;
mon rite, -or hard-cider political mass-meeting. &#xD;
Beginning with the, postulate that "Nature abhors a vacuum"&#xD;
itf does not seem difficult. to understand something, at least, of&#xD;

&#xD;
the-rationale- of this sympathetic influence of one man over&#xD;
another. The laws of the 'distribution of this Odic force seem&#xD;
to bear a somewhat general affinity to those of electricity. The&#xD;
surcharged cloud discharges its superfluous fluid into the cloud&#xD;
more negatively charged. The man holding a. superfluous&#xD;
amount of vital or-Odic force, can - dismiss a portion. of this-&#xD;
along the course of its properxlightning-rods, or conveyers,.the&#xD;
nerves:-into- the organisation -of -a being more negatively&#xD;
charged, or, in other words, of a weaker man. As electricity&#xD;
can only.. act upon inert matter through its proper media, the&#xD;
elements, so the Odic fluid can only-- act upon organised matter&#xD;
normally throughits proemedium, the nerves, of vitality.&#xD;
 mmu  i   of the odic fluid, by'which. sympathy be-&#xD;
tween'the two beings has been established, can be, to a certain&#xD;
degree, .regulated -.and controlled by manipultioenswhich bring&#xD;
the thur~bs and fingers of the hand, ,which are properly Odic&#xD;
poles, in contact with certain great nerves, or centres of nerves,&#xD;
alongwhiicli"idifluenc can be readilyommuncated. These&#xD;
manipulations, the vital and original meanings of which these&#xD;
lfesmer agitators have betrayed, maybe -traced vexjcilearly&#xD;
through the most important ceremonies of.religion, and the&#xD;
secret orders of fraternisation in the world. From this point of&#xD;
view, how significant the "la ing-on.of hands" in ordination,&#xD;
thet"joinu  ofhands" in the marriage ceremony &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
Here let us. remark, that we would'no more be understood&#xD;
as accusing .a Christian' Priesthood, in modern times, of having&#xD;
made, an, improper use,, either inside or out of their- profession,&#xD;
of 'the manipulations mentioned above, than we would think of&#xD;
accusing them of having, as a class, any special knowledge of&#xD;
their significance beyond that of ceremonial forms, set down in&#xD;
&#xD;
IN R0I)UOilN.,&#xD;
&#xD;
the discipline. It has been to the Heathen Priesthood that.we&#xD;
have consistently attributed a knowledge of tie ps  Toolical&#xD;
mepanigHofthese. ceremonials, which have descended through&#xD;
the Hebrew and Christian churcheswasvowed detfo  a&#xD;
significance, and intended; in their arbitrary exaction, as, toa&#xD;
certain degree, ordained tests of Christian faith and obedience.-&#xD;
But it isby no, means indispensable to tLe exhibition of the&#xD;
Odie phenomena, that the processes of manipulation should&#xD;
have been literally gone through with in all cases--nor, indeed,&#xD;
in the majority even--for some of the most apparently inexpli-&#xD;
cable and extraordinary of them all are brought about without&#xD;
such intervention. Take, as comparatively "modern instances,"&#xD;
such effects as those produced by-the preaching of Peter the&#xD;
Hermit, when not only vast armies of men were moved like&#xD;
flights of locusts toward the Desert,' on the breeze of' his fiery&#xD;
breath, to disappear,.too, as they, within its bosom, and never&#xD;
be heard from again, but even great armies of children 'rushed&#xD;
in migratory hordes to the sea-ports, to ship for the Holy Land!&#xD;
--and those produced by the crusade of Father Mathewasist&#xD;
intemperance, in our time, when, all Ireland- lay wailing at his&#xD;
feet. These great jurors were precisely -identical with those&#xD;
already enumerated, so tar as the -sympathetic or motive power&#xD;
went. So with the story of the rise of Mahbmet, Joe Smith,&#xD;
-Miller; and all such agitators.- They are usually men of pro-&#xD;
digious vital power, and of course surcharged with the Odic&#xD;
fluid, who begin these great movements; and they possess, be-&#xD;
side, vast patience and endurance.- They begin by filling the&#xD;
individuals in immediate contact with them, as 1Vahomet did&#xD;
his own family, with the superfluity of the Odic force in them'&#xD;
selves, and having thus obtained .a single medium by this imme-&#xD;

diate contact-which, although it may not imply the formal&#xD;
)Manipukations with preconceived design;implies the accidental&#xD;
equivalents .-the circle gradually enlarges- through each fresh&#xD;
accession, in much the same way that it began, until, after a few&#xD;
patient years of unshaken endurance, the apostle finds himself&#xD;
-surrounded by thousands and thousands of human beings,&#xD;
whose volition is swayed through this Odic force -this sympa-&#xD;
thetic medium   by his own central, resolute, and self-poised&#xD;
will, as if they were bat one man. His moveless volition has&#xD;
been, from the beginning, the base and axis of the vast sympa-&#xD;
thetic movement going on around him, and upon he single&#xD;
strength of the Odic - force within him, all depends, until,&#xD;
through- a thorough organisation of ceremonial laws and obser-&#xD;
rances, the system of which he was the vital centre assumes a&#xD;
corporate existence, and can stand alone.&#xD;
This is about the method in which all such organizations,&#xD;
radiating from the one man power or centre, widen their clues&#xD;
to an extreme circumference, until the force of the pebble'thrown&#xD;
into the, great lake is'exhausted. So it is with all sympathetic&#xD;
excitements-from the Dancing Dervishes, the Shaking Quakers,&#xD;
or the Barking-Brothers, to the vast Empire of France, led fren-&#xD;
zied over the world in the willio'-the-wisp chase of univer-&#xD;
sal sovereignty, by the fantastic will ,of a 'Napoleon. These&#xD;
are some of the general phenomena of sympathy, and there are&#xD;
many quite as extraordinary, if not as broad in what are called&#xD;
atmospheric Or epidemic conditions, which go'to prove the uni-&#xD;
versality of this sympathetic law.-&#xD;
The distinctions between Od and Heat, Od and Electricity,&#xD;
as well as Od and Magnetism, have been so c   jearl demon-&#xD;
Vated by the investigations of Baron Reichenbach as to leave,&#xD;
&#xD;
INTRODUCTION.'&#xD;
&#xD;
at present no. choice between. the terms. Od expresses that&#xD;
force which, differing in many essential properties from the other&#xD;
two, can alone through its phenomena be recondiled.with what&#xD;
we knowof the Sympathetic or Nervous .Fluid.. It is therefore&#xD;
used as a synonym of this mysterious agency, and as conveying&#xD;
a far higher definition - and significance than either- the -term&#xD;
Electricity or Mesmerism.&#xD;
The 'worst and the best that the agitation, begun by Mesmer&#xD;
has accomplished, is, to have stripped old Necromancy of its&#xD;
mysterious spells, by revealing something of the rationale of&#xD;
them, While at the same time, in unveiling its. processes to the&#xD;
sharp eyes of modern knaves, they have been enabled to appro-&#xD;
priate and practise them again with even more than the old&#xD;
success, under the new christening of "scientific experiment.",&#xD;
It is, I think, easily enough shown, bya minute and circum-&#xD;
stantial comparison of the cotemporary history of the dark age&#xD;
of black art ascendancy in Europe, which was literally the- dark&#xD;
age of chivalry, with that of Cotton Mather witch-burning en-&#xD;
lightenment in New England, that the. arts practised by the&#xD;
accused in both these countries, and at all other such pe-&#xD;
riods in all other countries, were nearly identical with each&#xD;
other; and those familiarised to us through the doings of mes-&#xD;
meric manipulation, revelation, clairvoyance, spiritual knockings,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.  are generally the very same, though assuming slight&#xD;
shades of difference, indicating some progressive development.&#xD;
A partial knowledge of psychological laws, which was formerly,&#xD;
and with great plausibility, considered altogether too dangerous&#xD;
pabulum for the vulgar mind, has been sown broadcast, by the&#xD;
empiricism of this mesmeric movement, the principal oracles&#xD;
and expounders of which have been clearly as ignorant of the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8247-00000007"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
SPIRITUAL VAMPIRISM.&#xD;
&#xD;
causes with 'which they agitated, as ever wrinkled crone of peat-&#xD;
smoked hovel was of the true -laws, of that occult palmistry,&#xD;
through the practice, or vague traditions of which, she finally&#xD;
prophesied herself into the martyrdom of- the " red-hot plough.&#xD;
shares," or the warm resting-place of the pot of boiling pitch.&#xD;
They only know that' certain formulas produce certain results,&#xD;
and as they are blundering entirely in the dark, they mix those-&#xD;
which have a basis in science with the crude and meaningless&#xD;
forms which ignorance, with its abject cunning, easy supplies.&#xD;
From such amalgamations have arisen the mummeries of conju-&#xD;
ration inwhatever form,,and by the imprudent use of which,&#xD;
the credulous, simple and superstitious, are so easily "-fright-&#xD;
ened from their propriety," and thus made easy victims of more&#xD;
dangerous arts.&#xD;
But it is a study of the fearful uses which have been made by&#xD;
the evil-disposed, of this partial knowledge of the laws of rela-&#xD;
tion of soul to the body, that is more-interesting now than these&#xD;
olden disguises of the same evil in more helpless forms; as now,.&#xD;
through the mesmeric agitation, it has really attained ;to some&#xD;
gleam of causes-has now something of scientific illumination&#xD;
to steady and give direction to its reckless and deadly- aim. In&#xD;
the radius of its hurtful circumference, the vicious power ofthe&#xD;
witch, fortune-teller or conjuror, was as much more circum-&#xD;
scribed than that of the semi-scientific charlatan of clairvoyance,&#xD;
as the vision of the mole is-less than that of the viper, which,&#xD;

The' relative degrees in which-the Odic or sympathetic fluid,&#xD;
may be found exhibited in the different individuals of our race,&#xD;
have been previously remarked in general terms. In the sexes,&#xD;
&#xD;
INTRODUOTION.-,.13&#xD;
we most usuaJly find the.positive pole i1 man, who gives out,&#xD;
and the negative in woman, who receives and absorbs from him,&#xD;
the dispenser.. 'Though this be the general rule so far as the&#xD;
sexes.are concerned,.it is by no- means the universal rule for the&#xD;
race---since there are among men but few positive poles,- or fwed&#xD;
°ceutres of Odic radiation; and where such are found, they are&#xD;
observed to possess much of what we commonly call "influ-&#xD;
ence" with or upon others. All the. parties; therefore, within&#xD;
the circle of thissympathetic radiation, or" magnetic attraction,"&#xD;
as it is popularly termed, must necessarily.'be,-relatively to .this&#xD;
positive pole,negative poles, without regard to sex--while each of&#xD;
these comparatively negative poles may in turn be a positive pole,&#xD;
or Odic centre, to those below or of weaker nature than himself.&#xD;
Those men who have been known to-allhumanity as prophets,&#xD;
poets, law-givers, discoverers, reformers, &amp;amp;c., are, and have&#xD;
been, what we mean by. positive Odic poles; for -while they&#xD;
have seemed.to'stand in immediate an4 direct communion with&#xD;
the spiritual source of all wisdom,they have at the same time&#xD;
given out the impulse thus granted, to the people byewhom they&#xD;
are surrounded, thus acting as the chosen media "of divine reve&#xD;
lation, and from the cloudy summits of Sinais handing down&#xD;
the tables of the law to all the tribes.&#xD;
Now there-is a mighty, radiation of the Odic force from these&#xD;
men, through which; the love, wisdom, or rather will in&#xD;
or sent through them -s nade operative upon the great masses&#xD;
of makind; and' this same radiatiii,in the greater.or less de-&#xD;

cn then be easily understood howwhat are -called " evil '&#xD;
and  "good 'spirits''-hould through it affect mankind. This&#xD;
will be fully'illustrated when we observe the common condi-&#xD;
tions of health anid disuse: Health is 'good and disease is&#xD;
evil; andithese are the two-eternally antagonisti chemical forces&#xD;
inethe universe. Health is that normal condition of the body&#xD;
which enablestit to-resist evil and maintain the proper balance&#xD;
of'the spiritual anid material' elements. - Disease is that abnor-&#xD;
mal condition of.the 'body in which'the integrity of the spiritual&#xD;
.nd organic functions has been destroyed 'through, the sympa-&#xD;
thetic fthedia by 'evil, and good overcome.-  -&#xD;
In eitiier-case, the balance is. destroyed, and the immediate&#xD;
consequence may be, in'the one, sudden paroxysms of fearful&#xD;
insanity,-or in the other, sudden -death,. asin common apoplexy.&#xD;
'Thus the popular fallacy, that all 'things having a -source in&#xD;

is in a very sixnple wa exposed. We see there may be what&#xD;
are called eyt, as -*ell'as 'good spirits,:which hold coinmunion&#xD;

such matters is,-that, while the good spirits are those propitious&#xD;

joy, and peace, through the unbounded happiness of the normal&#xD;

thetto, the first is the evil type;'for, born in the-gross sphere&#xD;
of tb. passio is with a vigorous orgnsation,'but family ilu-&#xD;
iimated at the beginig with.that golden light of love which&#xD;
Is spiritual life, the' fierce half-monkey being is propelled 'on-&#xD;
wards, and even'upwards, by the basest of the purely animal&#xD;
instincts,"appetites, and lusts. If 'such beings strive towards&#xD;
the light of the harmonious and the beautiful, it is' not because&#xD;
they yearn' for either the holylor the good, but because it lends&#xD;
a lurid charm to appetite and glorifies a lust.&#xD;
The other 'character, in whom the spiritual predominates,&#xD;
whether from., a natal inequality, as is'very frequently the case,&#xD;
or froin the sheer exhaustion of the physical powers, through&#xD;
emasculating vices, is yet, in itself, good, so far as its morbid&#xD;

only be regarded,.whether used for evil or good,: as a rmedifam.&#xD;
This character is the common Clairvoyant, to whom we are&#xD;
indebted for those, strangely-mingled gleams of remote truth,&#xD;
with errors the most grave and injurious, .which have so tended&#xD;
to confuse the judgment of mankind in= regard to the pheno.&#xD;
mena of Clairvoyance.' Such persons can be. made as readily&#xD;

INTRODUCTION..&#xD;
class, and is purely " a medium-" .of the sympathetic ~fluid.&#xD;
His organisation is most sensibly sympathetic and -delicately&#xD;
responsive,.but. is too .feeble to balance.his spiritual develop-&#xD;
ment.  His' case stands, therefore, as the most remarkable&#xD;
modern instance of what the- ancients termed "atiination;&#xD;
but as has heen the case with other false prophets, his "gifts"&#xD;
have proved of no value, except to knaves. 'He'das undoubt.&#xD;
edly practised upon "by a choice set of such characters; and,&#xD;
now that he has found in marriage a sympathetic restoration,&#xD;
through the physical,.of its needed balance ,with the spiritual,&#xD;
he has lost his "lying gift" of prophecy.&#xD;
We have examined this man carefully, and are convinced&#xD;
that the whole{-mystery of his revelations' and character may' be&#xD;
contained in a nut-shell. He is to the sphere of intellectual&#xD;
and spiritual sympathy, and in a lower sense, precisely -an&#xD;
analogous case with that of Mozart, in the sphere of the musical&#xD;
and spiritual. When the great soul of humanity has been long&#xD;
say one generation-in travail with a great thought in art,&#xD;
science, music, or mechanics, there-is sure to be somebody born&#xD;
in the succeeding generation who is physically, mentally, and&#xD;
spiritually, the impersonation and' embodiment of this thought,&#xD;
of which the age 'is in labor, and who must of necessity be-&#xD;
come, solely and singly, the expression and embodiment thereof.&#xD;
Thus Mozart,'the infant prodigy in music; who at five years old&#xD;
was the pet of monarchs and the miracle of his age, continued,&#xD;
with no signs of precociousness, a steady and-consistent' devel-&#xD;
opment, which showed him to be indeed the embodimentof the&#xD;
musical inspirations of his age. His' revelations in music were&#xD;
just. as prodigious as even the rabid worshippers of the Davis&#xD;

essential differences between-the.results of the two.&#xD;
Dpvis, born amidst the travail. of:this new Mesmieric agita-&#xD;
tion, became the most sensitive organ of the -sympathetic -fluid-&#xD;
in intellect, as the other had been in music ; but asj in the case&#xD;
of Mozart, the -exciting cause came from Nature, and consti-&#xD;
tuted" her .purest and .most sacred inspirations, so the in-&#xD;
spiration of Davis ,came from  man, with all his ,inperfect -&#xD;
tions iand=subjective tendencies:  The sequel,has been, the&#xD;
inspirations of Mozart are considered now by mankind as only&#xD;
second to the f Divine, while those- of Davis are justly regarded&#xD;
as morbid; fragmentary, incomplete, and worthless.&#xD;
The organisation of Mozart was equally sympathetic with&#xD;
that of Davis but it was of that healthy tone -which could-only&#xD;
respond to nature and the natural; while the organisation of&#xD;
-Davis-belongs to that mich inferior type, whichfrom its mor-&#xD;
bid and unbalanced conditions, can respond only to the human&#xD;
as"the representative of nature. Such persons receive nothing&#xD;
direct from nature, but only through its representative, man:.&#xD;
. It would seem as if thle world were absolutely divided into&#xD;
two elapses--the radiating and the absorbing; the first receiving&#xD;
from nature, and the second from ,man. In the first, are. the&#xD;
holy brotherhood of prophets and the poets, an'd in the, second,&#xD;
the poor slaves of sympathy-the knaves and fools'--the impos-&#xD;
tors who play upon its, well-known laws, and, deceiving them-&#xD;
selves aswell as-others, may well be said to'know not what&#xD;
they4do."&#xD;
We. are- convinced that no man, who has kept -himself is,&#xD;
formed of the psychological history and progress of his race,'&#xD;
can by any meanis fail to recognise- at once, in the -pretended&#xD;

INTRODU0TION.                  19&#xD;
" Revelations"' of Davis, the -mere disjecta mem- aof thesys*&#xD;
teams so extensively promulgated by Fourier nd  wdenborg.&#xD;
When you come to compare this fact -itl- the additional one,&#xD;
that Davis, 'during the whole period of his  utteringss," was&#xD;
surrounded by groups, consisting. of the disciples of Fourier&#xD;
and Swedenborg; .as, for instance, the leading Fourierite of&#xD;
America was, for:a. time,. a constant- attendant upon those mys-&#xD;
terious 'meetings, at which the -myths of innocent Davis: were&#xD;
formally announced from the condition of Clairvoyance% and&#xD;
transcribed by his keper 'for the press,- while the.chief exponent&#xD;
and minister, of Swedenborgianism in New York was often&#xD;
seated side by side with him. -.&#xD;
Can it be' possible that these men failed to comprehend, as&#xD;
thought after thought, principle after principle, was enunciated&#xD;
in their presence, which they-had previously supposed to belong&#xD;
exclusively to . their own schools, that the "revelation" was&#xD;
merely a sympathetic 'reflex of their own :derived systems? It&#xD;
was no accident; for, as often as Fourierism predominated . in&#xD;
"the evening lecture;" it'was -sure that-the prime representative&#xD;
of Courier was present; and when the peculiar views of Swe-&#xD;
denborg prevailed, it was equally certain that he was forcibly&#xD;
represented in the conclave. 'Sometimes both -schools were&#xD;
present; and on- that identical occasion we have a composite&#xD;
metaphysics promulgated, which exhibited, most consistently,&#xD;
doctrines of Swedenborg and Fourier, jumbled in 'liberal&#xD;
and extraordinary confusion. This is, 'in epitome, about the&#xD;
whole history of such 'agitations. The weak Clairvoyant falls&#xD;
naturally into-the hands of knaves who are superior to him in&#xD;
physical vitality. He becomes, first, the medium. of theit&#xD;
vague and feeble- intellection ; and then,- as attention is at-&#xD;

of veryy school; and aa he7 'is brought into their'various- Odic&#xD;
spheres,.he sprgnounces the 'creed of. each in .his morbidly illu-&#xD;
minated'language, and it sounds to the mob like inspiration.&#xD;
There is no greater nonsense; men are inspired through-&#xD;
natural laws.  But this comparatively innocuous character,&#xD;
which'we have thus far stepped aside-to indicate, is nothdig&#xD;
compared to. the first specimen of this Clairvoyant. type which&#xD;
we have classified. This, it will be remembered, is'the animal&#xD;
born with feeble spirituality, but vigorous physique; which is,&#xD;
at the same time, intensely sympathetic. These, as we, have&#xD;
said, are the infernal natures; for, possessing no life outside the&#xD;
lo4ei animal passions, self is to them the close, centre of all&#xD;
being, and their Odic sensitiveness a, vampireabsorption, the&#xD;
horrible .craving of which, not'fontent with the mere -exhaustion&#xD;
of the animal life of the victim, by wanton provocations,. drinks&#xD;
up soul and mind, to fill the beastly void of their own. These&#xD;
wgree  than ghouls, that live, upon the dying rather than the-&#xD;
dead, possess some ..fearflly dangerous - and extraordinary&#xD;
powers.&#xD;
:Vampirism, as a superstition, prevailed, not -many years, ago,&#xD;
like .eneral pestilence, throughout the countries of Servia and&#xD;
Wallachia. ,Whole districts, infected by'this horrible disease,&#xD;
were desolated; people grew. wiId with terror, and, in their&#xD;
savage ignorance, comniitted monstrous sacrilege uon, the'&#xD;
sanctities of burial.  Bodies that had rested quietly, in.-their&#xD;
graves for ten,.}twenty, and even 'eighty days, were dragged&#xD;
forth, to .have stakes; driven through their  chests; 'and if. any&#xD;
blood was, found, they were burned to ashea&#xD;

&#xD;
The, belief was, that the deceased, when 'living, had been'&#xD;
bitten by a human vampire, which, coming forth. froa'i its grave&#xD;
by night, had sunk its white teeth in.his throat, and -drunk his&#xD;
blood, thereby-causing a lingering death; in which 'he was also&#xD;
doomed to the hideous fate of becoming a vampire, after his&#xD;
burial.&#xD;
The bodies of vampires, when dug up, presented a perfectly'&#xD;
natural appearance; and,'even in those  ses where -the scarf-&#xD;
skin peeledoff, 'a 'new slin was found underneath, 'and new&#xD;
nails formed on. the fingers. The vital blood was found 'iM the&#xD;
heart,' lungs, and viscera, exhibiting the conditions of perfect&#xD;
health.  How the "vampire got out 'of his' grave, without&#xD;
scratching a hole, does not appear.'&#xD;
Thus we find, in modern vampirism, a strange compound of&#xD;
ancient superstition with. well-known  scientific truths. -The&#xD;
vampire is the counterpart of the ancient ghoul, with the simupfe&#xD;
transfer ;of the habits of the vampire-bat to its identity. These&#xD;
are then connected with the 'fact, well known to the medical&#xD;
profession, that persons have been buried, supposed to be dead,&#xD;
who, in reality) had only fallen into what is called the death-&#xD;
trance; and who, 'had they been left above ground for a su$-&#xD;
cient period, would have probably resuscitated of"thentselves.&#xD;
That they have done so after burial, is a familiar fact; since&#xD;
'bodies     -   "e.&#xD;

their position in the coffin. How long bodies, thus indonsider-&#xD;

THE HISTORY OF ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN.&#xD;
CHAPTER        I.&#xD;
THE GIRLHOOD OF ETHEREAL.&#xD;
"Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damned?"&#xD;
IN a mean and sterile district of Vermont, which shall be&#xD;
nameless, but which exhibits on every side stretches of bare&#xD;
land, with here and there the variety of clumps of gnarled and&#xD;
stunted oaks, EtherialSoftdown was born. If mountains give&#xD;
birth to heroes,, what ought to have been the product of a low-&#xD;
lying land like this, on whose dreary basins the summer's'sun&#xD;
wilted the feeble vegetation, and the bleak winds of'winter&#xD;
wrestled fiercely with the scrubby oaks, whose crooked and&#xD;
claw-like limbs seemed talons of some hideous, gaunt and&#xD;
reptile growth'.&#xD;
On the edge of one of the most desolate of these stretches,&#xD;
and beneath the shelter of the most ugly ~of these deinonised&#xD;
oaks, were scattered the storm-blackened sheds of a miserable&#xD;
hamlet, in one of which, for there were no degrees in their&#xD;
comfortless dilapidation, the family of our heroine, the Softdowns,&#xD;
resided, and another yet smaller and at some distance apart from&#xD;
the rest, was occupied by her father, who was a shoemaker, as&#xD;

a workshop. This was one of those strange, out-of-the-way,&#xD;
starved and dismal looking places that you sometimes stumble&#xD;
upon in our prosperous land'- which ought long since to have&#xD;
been deserted with the vanished cause of-the temporary pros-&#xD;
perity which had given it birth- butin which the people seem&#xD;
to be petrified into a morbid serenity of endurance, and look as&#xD;
if under the spell of some great Enchanter they awaited his&#xD;
awakening touch.&#xD;
The child, which was the birth of a- coarsely organised&#xD;
mother, was as drolly deformed with its squint eye and stoop-&#xD;
ing shoulders as fancy could-depict the elfin genius of such&#xD;
a scene. Dirty, bedraggled and neglected, with unkempt locks&#xD;
tangled and writhing like snakesabout her face, and sharp, gray&#xD;
animal eyes. gleaming from beneath, the ill-conditioned creature&#xD;
darted impishly, hither- and yon amidst the hamlet hovels, or&#xD;
peering from some thicket, of weird oaks, started the stolid&#xD;
neighbors with the dread that apparitions.bring.&#xD;
Indeed,'so wilful, unexpected and-eccentric were her move-,&#xD;
ments, that the people, in addition to regarding the oaf-like child&#xD;
with a half feeling of dread, gave her the credit of being half-&#xD;
witted as well. There was a hungry sharpness in her eye that&#xD;
made them shrink; a furious, raging, craving lust for something,&#xD;
they-could not understand what,, which startled them beyond&#xD;
measure; for, as in their -stagnant lives, they had never been&#xD;
much troubled with souls themselves, they could not understand&#xD;
this soul-famine that so whetted those fierce eager eyes.&#xD;
The' father, Softdown, who appears to have been something&#xD;
more developed than the mother, and to have possessed a gro-&#xD;
tesque and rugged wit, more'-remarkable for its directness than&#xD;
its delicacy, became the 'sole instructor and companion of the&#xD;
distraught child, who' readily acquired from him an uncouth&#xD;
method of enouncing trite truisms unexpectedly, which was to&#xD;
constitute in after life one of her-chief, because most successful&#xD;
weapons.&#xD;
Etherial early displayed a passion for 'acquiring not know-&#xD;
&#xD;
ledge, but :a facility of. gibberish, which proved exhausting&#xD;
enough, to the shallow-receptacles around her, specially as her&#xD;
mode of getting at the names and properties -of thing&amp;amp;so closely&#xD;
resembled the monkey's method of studying physical laws.&#xD;
She had first to burn her fingers before she-could be made to&#xD;
comprehend- that fire was .hot, but that was enough about fire&#xD;
for this wise child; she remembered it ever after as a physical&#xD;
sensation, and therefore it had ever after a name for her; and so&#xD;
with all other experiences, they were to her sensational, not spi-&#xD;
ritual or intellectual. The nameof a truth could come to her&#xD;

of her features growing more reconciled to harmonious lines&#xD;

IN Barclay Street, New York, years ago, flourished, at No. 63,&#xD;
that famous caravansarie of all the most rabid wild animals on&#xD;
the Continent, who styled themselves Reformers and New-light&#xD;
People, Come-outers, Vegetarians, Abolitionists, Amalgama-&#xD;
tionists, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c., well known to fame as the "Graham House."&#xD;
Here, any fine morning, at the breakfast-table, you might meet&#xD;
a dozen or so of the most 'boisterous of the then existing or&#xD;
embryo Reform notdrieties of the day. Mark, we say notorie-&#xD;
ties, for that is the word.&#xD;
From the Meglatherium' Oracle, whose monstrous head, co-&#xD;
vered -with a mouldy excrescence, answering for hair, which&#xD;
gave it most the: seeming of a huge swamp-born fungus of a&#xD;
night-who-sat bolting his hard-boiled eggs by the dozen, with&#xD;
bran-bread in proportion, washing them down' with pints of&#xD;
diluted parched-corn coffee-even 'to the most;meagre, hungry-&#xD;
eyed, and talon-fingered of the soul-starved World-Reformers,&#xD;
that stooped forward amidst the- babble, and, between huge&#xD;
gulps of hot meal mush, croaked forth his orphic words -they&#xD;
were all one and alike -the mutterers of myths made yet more&#xD;
misty by their parrot-mouthings of them!&#xD;
Here every crude; ungainly crotchet that ever possessed igno-&#xD;
rant and presumptuous brains; here every wild and-unbroken&#xD;
hobby that ever driveller or madman rode, was urged together,&#xD;
pell-mell, in a loud-voiced gabbling chaos. Here, the negro&#xD;

fair, frail form of some lean, rectangular-figured spinster-devotee&#xD;
of amalgamation from New England.       '&#xD;
Here the hollow-eyed' bony spectre of an old bran-bread dis-&#xD;
ciple stared, in the grim ecstacy of anticipation, at the ruddy&#xD;
cheeks of the new convert opposite, whose lymphatic, well-&#xD;
conditioned corporation shivered with affright, as he met those&#xD;
ravin-lit eyes, and a vague sense of their awful meaning first&#xD;
possessed him, as his furtive glance took in the sterile "spread"&#xD;
upon 'the table, to which he had been ostentatiously summoned&#xD;
for "a feast."&#xD;
Hereesome Come-outer Quaker, with what had been, at best,&#xD;
cropped hair, might be seen with the crop now shaven yet more&#xD;
close to his, bullet-head, in sign of his greater accession in spi-&#xD;
ritual strength beyond the :heathen he had left behind, sitting&#xD;
side. by, side with some New-light or Phalanxterian- apostle, with&#xD;
his long, sandy, carroty, or rather golden locks, as he chooses to&#xD;

emulation of the revered " Christ Head" of the old Italian&#xD;

Here the blustering peace-man, and professed non-resistant,&#xD;
railed with a noisy insolence, rendered more insufferably insult-&#xD;
ing in the precise ratio of exemption from personal accountability-&#xD;
claimed by his pusillanimous doctrines.  Here too, a notorious&#xD;
Abolitionist, with his tallow-skinned, and -generally-disgusting'&#xD;
face, roared through grQss lips his vulgar anathemas against the.&#xD;
South, which had foolishly canonised'this -soulless and meddle-&#xD;
some non-resistant rulian, in' expressing their readiness to hang&#xD;
him, should he be caught within their territory..&#xD;
Here the weak and puling secretary of some milk-and-water&#xD;
creedrolled up his rheumy eyes amidst the din, and sighed for&#xD;
horror of a " sad, wicked world."J Here the sharp animal eyes,&#xD;
the cool effrontery and bard-faced impudence of ignoramus Pro-&#xD;
fessors of all sorts of occult sciences, ologies, and isms, met&#xD;
you,-with hungry glances'that seemed searching for "the green "&#xD;
in your eye ; and mingled with .the whole, a sufficiently spicy&#xD;

ETHERIAL SOFTDOWit -            31&#xD;
&#xD;
sprinkle of feminine'" Professors," of the same class, whose bold&#xD;
looks and sensual faces were quite sufficient offsets to the extreme&#xD;
etherialisation of their spiritualized doctrines.&#xD;
Here, in a word, the blank and ever-shocking glare of harm-&#xD;
less and positive idiocy absolutely would escape notice at, all, or&#xD;
be mistaken for the solid repose of common sense, in contrast&#xD;
with the unnatural sultry wildness of the prevailing and predo-&#xD;
miinating expression !&#xD;
But this menagerie of mad people held caged, in one of its&#xD;
upper rooms, the object of'immediate interest. On entering&#xD;
the apartment, which was an ordinary boarding-house bed-&#xD;
chamber, a scene at once shocking and startling was presented.&#xD;
A female, seemingly about thirty-three, was stretched upon a&#xD;
low cot-bed, near the middle of the floor, while on the. bed and&#xD;
upon the floor were scattered, napkins, which appeared deeply&#xD;
saturated with blood, with which.the- pillow-case and sheet were&#xD;
also stained. A napkin was pressed with a convulsive clutch&#xD;
of the hands to her mouth, into which, with a low, .suffocating&#xD;
cough, which now and then broke the silence, she seemed to be&#xD;
throwing up quantities of blood from what appeared an alarm-&#xD;
ing hemorrhage.&#xD;
A gentleman, whose neat apparel and fresh benevolent face&#xD;
somehow spoke "physician !" leaned over the wonian, with an&#xD;
expression of anxiety, which appeared to be subdued by great&#xD;
effort of a trained will. He bent lower, and in an almost whis-&#xD;
pered voice, said:&#xD;
" My dear madam, you must restrain yourself. Tishemor-&#xD;
rhage continues beyond the reach of any remedies,,so long -as&#xD;
you permit this violent excite ent of your maternal feelings to&#xD;
continue. - Let me exhort you to patience -to bear the neces-&#xD;
sary evils of.your unfortunate condition with more patience!"&#xD;
The only answer was a slow despairing shake of, the head,&#xD;
accompanied by a deep hysterical groan, which seemed to flood&#xD;
the napkin at her mouth with a fresh .effusion.of blood, which&#xD;
now trickled between her fingers and down upon her breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8247-00000017"/>&#xD;
32               SPIRITUAL VAMPIRISM.&#xD;
The humane physician turned, with an'uncontrollable expression&#xD;
of horrified-sympathy and alarm upon his face, and snatching a&#xD;
clean napkin from the table, gently removed the saturated cloth&#xD;
from the clutching pressure of her fingers, and tenderly wiping-&#xD;
the blood from her mouth and person, left the clean one in her&#xD;
grasp._&#xD;
"Be calm ! be calm    I pray you! you must some day&#xD;
escape his persecutions. You have-friends ; they will assist&#xD;
you to obtain a divorce yet, and rescue your chird from his&#xD;
clutches. Do, pray ,now, be calm !"  The voice of the good&#xD;
man trembled with emotion while he spoke, and the perspiration&#xD;
started from his forehead..&#xD;
At this instant the door was suddenly thrown open, and a' tall,&#xD;
gaunt man, with a very small round head, leaden eyes, and a&#xD;
wide ungainly mouth, with a.projecting under jaw, singularly&#xD;
expressive of animal stolidity, paused on the threshold and&#xD;
coolly looked around .the -room. The woman, sprang forward&#xD;
at the sight, as if to rise, while a fresh gush of blood poured&#xD;
from her mouth, bedabbling her fingers and the sheet. The&#xD;
physician instinctively seized her to prevent her rising, but, re-&#xD;
sisting the pressure by which he gently strove to restore her&#xD;
head to the pillow, she retained her half-erect position, and with&#xD;
eyes that had suddenly become strangely distorted, orawry in&#xD;
their sockets, she glared towards the intruder for:an instant, and&#xD;
then slowly raising her flickering hand, which dripped with her&#xD;
own blood, she pointed at him, and muttered, in-a sepulchral&#xD;
voice, that, besides, seemed choking:&#xD;
" That is he! 'see-him! see him'! There stands 'the monster&#xD;
who would rob me of my babe, as he daily robs me of money."-&#xD;
Here the blood gushed up again, and she was for a moment&#xD;
suffocated into- silence, as the, object of her denunciation&#xD;
stood perfectly unmoved, while a cold' smile half lit his leaden&#xD;
eyes. This seemed to fill the apparently dying woman with&#xD;
renewed and hysterical life.. She raised herself yet more erect,&#xD;
and still pointing with her bloody, quivering finger, while -her&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHEREAL SO TDOWN.             8&#xD;
&#xD;
head tossed to and fro,,and the distorted eyes glared staringly&#xD;
out before her, she spoke in a gasping, uncertain way, as if&#xD;
communing with herself. "The- wretch taunts me! my mur-&#xD;
derer dares to sneer! 0 God ! must this, always continue ?&#xD;
must that brute always follow me up and down in the land, to&#xD;
rob me of the money that I earn  - to be my tyrant, my jailor!&#xD;
He will not give me money to pay postage even, out of that I&#xD;
earn abundantly, while he is earning nothing. He will not give&#xD;
me clothes to keep me decent, while I earn enough. He will&#xD;
not give my child shoes to wear, though he is trying to take her&#xD;
from me !"&#xD;
" That is a lie, Etherial! you know I 'gave the child a new&#xD;
pair yesterday !" gruffly interposed the man at this stage of the&#xD;
deeply tragic soliloquy, while he stepped forward towards the&#xD;
bed: A choking scream followed, and the blood was spattered&#xD;
over the spread as she fell back screaming-&#xD;
" Take him away ! take him away ! He is killing me with&#xD;
his brutality !" and then her head sank in sudden collapse upon&#xD;
the pillow, and the face, which had heretofore looked singularly&#xD;
natural in color, for one in, such a dreadful strait from hemor-&#xD;
rhage, turned livid pale, while the blood continued to pour upon&#xD;
the pillow from the corners of the relaxed 'mouth.&#xD;
The poor physician, whose frame had been shivering with&#xD;
intense excitement during this interview, sprang erect, as the&#xD;
form of what he-Ssupposed to be a' corpse fell heavily-from his&#xD;
arms, and with the natural indignation of a feeling man, fully&#xD;
roused at what he considered the murderous brutality of the. hus-&#xD;
band, rushed forward, and seizing him furiously by the collar,&#xD;
shook and choked him in a'perfect ecstacy of rage, shouting, at&#xD;
the same time-&#xD;
"Unnatural .beast ! monster ! You have. killed that poor&#xD;
child at last ! murdered your own wife, whon you swore -to&#xD;
nourish and protect! Infernal villain! you' ought to be drawn&#xD;
and quartered -hanging is too good for you! You saw the&#xD;
terrible condition of the poor victim of your brutalities when&#xD;
you came, yet you persisted ! In the name of humanity, I send&#xD;

hurled the unresisting wretch  who, by this time, had grown&#xD;
perfectly, black in the face under the rough handling of this-&#xD;
roused and indeed infuriate humanity-staggering out of the&#xD;
door -M-=and :ching it upon him, he proceeded .to apply such&#xD;
restoratives asen an- examination - the real condition' of the&#xD;
patient suggested.&#xD;
A short and anxious investigation proved it to he -rather a&#xD;
state of syneope-than. actual death; and, with a full return of&#xD;
all his  professional cauti n3yskill.and coolness, he applied him-&#xD;
self to the restoration of hj patient, with a heart greatly re-&#xD;
lieved by the discpvery that the result he so much dreaded was&#xD;
not yet, and liuggingto this kindly breast the consolation&#xD;
"while there is: life, there is hope,!". He paid no attention to&#xD;
clamorous knocks for. admissionsand lau d-talking excitement,-&#xD;
which the, violence of the preceding scene had no doubt caused&#xD;
in alarming-the house. In a kaitisnenthe good doctor cau-&#xD;
tiously -anbolted the door and came forth from the room, tread-&#xD;
ing as though on egg-shells. 'After leaving careful -instructions&#xD;
with the landlady that his patient) who now, slept, should under&#xD;
no pretence be disturbed, most especially by the husband, until&#xD;
his return, as her present repose might prove a -matter of life&#xD;
and. death,.he left the house, promising to call again in two&#xD;
hours.&#xD;
For one- hour the woman lay calm and motionless on her gory&#xD;
bed, as if in catalepsy, when- to -a low,' peculiar kndok. at the&#xD;
door, she sprang up, wideawake, and in the apparent full pos-&#xD;
session of -her faculties.&#xD;
"Who ?" she asked in a quick, firm tone, as she -threw the&#xD;
hair back from her eyes.&#xD;
Tolthe low response, " I, love!'.she stepped quickly from the&#xD;
bed and- snatched a shawl from the back of a chair, and, by&#xD;
several rapid;sideway movements of her feet at the same. time,&#xD;
thrust the -bloody -rapkins which strewed the floor beneath the&#xD;
bedr where ihey would be out of sight, and by a movement&#xD;
&#xD;

almost as swift, threw a clean "spread'-over the -blood-stained&#xD;
pillows and sheet, then drawing her large shawl closely over&#xD;
the stained dressing-gown in which she had.'risen,' she rushed&#xD;
first to the glass,:andsmoothed her hair with an activity that&#xD;
was positively amazing, and then to the door, which sheun-&#xD;
bolted on the inside-showing that she niust have risen to bolt&#xD;
it immediately as the-doctor passed out-and- admitted a-man&#xD;
who was in waiting.&#xD;
" Ah, my. soul's sister ! my Heaven-bride! how is thy&#xD;
spiritual strength this evening?" and at the same. time, as =her&#xD;
yielding form sank into his outspread.arms, he pressed her lips&#xD;
with his, adding, "I- salute thy chaste .spirit!" "-&#xD;
"Brother of.my soul, I was weary,,but now I am at rest. - I&#xD;
was wounded and fainting by the way, but the good Samaritan&#xD;
has come !" and she turned her eyes upward to his with a&#xD;
melting expression of confiding abandon.&#xD;
"Angel!" accompanied by a closer and convulsive clasp,&#xD;
was the response.                                z&#xD;
" What do- they say -of poor me'again, to-day, those cruel&#xD;
wicked people outside ?" she asked, with eyes still reverentially&#xD;
upraised to his, as-they moved slowly with clasped arms towards&#xD;
the cot, on the side of which they ,sat, she still leaning against&#xD;
his bosom.&#xD;
"My good sister, they say what evil spirits, always- prompt&#xD;
men to say of-the good, who, like the Prophets, -are sent to be&#xD;
stoned and persecuted on earth. You should not regard such.&#xD;
There are those who know you in the spirit,,to wham. it has&#xD;
been revealed through the spiritual sense, that you are good and&#xD;
true, as well- as iethe right, and through such, you will find&#xD;
strength of the Father."&#xD;
" Oh, you are so strong in spiritual mightiness that you do not&#xD;
sympathise with the weaknesses of we humbler mortals! I&#xD;
wonder, indeed, how you can forgive them ?" and her downcast&#xD;
eyes were furtively raised to his. - The man wore his hair thrown&#xD;
back over his head and behind his ears. H  drew himself up&#xD;

&#xD;
slightly atthis, and stroked back his looks, then placing his&#xD;
hand with patriarchal solemnity upon-her bowed head, proceeded&#xD;
in: a somewhat louder tone. "My simple child-my soul-sister,&#xD;
I should say, you are hardly upon the. threshold of the true wis-&#xD;
dom- Your knowledge. of the law' of'spiritual correspondence&#xD;
is yet too incomplete for you to understand how entirely good&#xD;
has been mistaken for evil, and evil confounded with good in&#xD;
the world. For instance -it is called evil by the ignorant&#xD;
world, for a brother -man to caress thee in the spirit as Ihave&#xD;
caressed thee but now. The. imaginations of a world that lieth&#xD;
in evil are impure. 'Evil to him who evil thinks !' The great&#xD;
doctrine of correspondence teaches that there are two lives-the&#xD;
spiritual and the animal. The passions of the animal are in the&#xD;
fleshly lusts; those of the spiritual are in no wise such, they&#xD;
are in the Heavenly-sphere,. they are of love .and wisdom.&#xD;
Thus, my caress in this Heavenly sphere is of no sin to thee,&#xD;
for by and through it I. convey to you, my spiritual sister, the&#xD;
strength of love and wisdom for which your heart yearns.,&#xD;
Thus-"-&#xD;
As-he stooped his head to renew the unresisted caress, the&#xD;
door flew open again,.and the man with. the wide mouth, the&#xD;
hideous chin and the leaden eye, stood again-upon the threshold,&#xD;
and as the affrighted pair looked up they saw he was backed by,-&#xD;
the curious faces of half-a-dozen chambermaids, jealous of the&#xD;
honor of the house, flanked by the indignant landlady and a&#xD;
score of prying, curious, sharp-eyed faces, which -might be&#xD;
recognised at a glance as belonging.to those pickled seraphs of&#xD;
reform,' known as " free-spoken" spinsters in New England.&#xD;
"There, they are at it !" shouted the man with the gaping&#xD;
mouth. "I told you so ! I told you that Professor was always&#xD;
kissing her !"&#xD;
"Yes!"&#xD;
"There they are, sure 'enough!"&#xD;
"I always thought. so !"_&#xD;
'cThe honor of my house !" bristled the landlady, striding&#xD;
forward. " I did not expect this of you, Professor!"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Madam !" said the gentleman with his hair behind his ears,&#xD;
.striding forward as he released the suddenly collapse ai d&#xD;
seemingly lifeless form he had just held within his embrace, and&#xD;
which fell back now heavily upon the pillow-spread, which was&#xD;
instantly discolored by a new gush of'blood from the mouth.&#xD;
" I was.administering, with all my zeal, spiritual comfort to this&#xD;
poor, sick and dying sister, when you burst in! See her, con-&#xD;
dition now!"&#xD;
He. waved his hand towards the tragic figure. " The 'Pro-&#xD;
fessor" occupied a parlor on the first floor, beside two bed-rooms&#xD;
adjoining this, and being on the palmy heights of his renown&#xD;
and plenitude of purse, it was not convenient for the landlady&#xD;
to quarrel with him at present. " Ah, if that is the case, Pro-&#xD;
fessor, I beg you to pardon us. The husband of this woman&#xD;
has misrepresented you and your beneficent motives, and&#xD;
accuses you of' all sorts of improprieties. We came up, at his&#xD;
urgency, to see for ourselves, and the shocking condition, in&#xD;
which we -find her now, proves that the ravings of the husband&#xD;
are, as she has always represented them, insane."&#xD;
" I've seen you kissing her before !" roared the husband,&#xD;
advancing threateningly upon the Professor, who, however&#xD;
spiritual in 'creed, did not now alpear particularly spirited, as&#xD;
he turned very pale, retreated backwards, and holding up his&#xD;
two trembling hands imploringly, exclaimedi-" Hold!,hold!&#xD;
my dear brother! It. was a spiritual kiss! I meant you no&#xD;
harm, nor that angel who lies there dying ! Our kiss' was pure&#xD;
and holy as the new snow.- Hold him! hold him-! Don't let&#xD;
him hurt me ! I am a non-resistant ! I am for peace !"&#xD;
"You holy kisses!' I don't believe in your holy kisses "&#xD;
gnashed the enraged husband, still following himup with war-&#xD;
like demonstrations; but here the easily appeased landlady&#xD;
interposed once more, to save the honor of her house in pre-&#xD;
venting a fight.&#xD;
"No blows in my house !" she shrieked, as she threw her-&#xD;
self between the parties. "The Professor is a man of God,&#xD;

seemed to be of that kind that a straw might turfy it aside, All&#xD;

manner.&#xD;
"What can that besottedwretch have been doing to her&#xD;
again ?" and he gently placed his fingers upon her pulse, and&#xD;
shook his head gravely as he did so.&#xD;
"Very low ! very low, indeed!-nearly absolute syncope&#xD;
again! This is horrible! How sorry I am that I was com-&#xD;
pded to leave her for a moment."&#xD;
"Is she really in danger, doctor?" asked the spiritual pro-&#xD;
fessor, advancing with recovered assurance.&#xD;
" Who are you, sir ?" he said, looking up sharply. " One&#xD;
of these officious fools, I suppose ?"  Then glancing his eye&#xD;
around at the crowded doorway, he straightened himself-hastily,&#xD;
and exclaimed -s&#xD;
"Leave the room,, all of you-she must be quiet-I wish to&#xD;
be alone with my patient ! Leave the room, sir, I say!" in a&#xD;
sterner voice, as the spiritual professor hesitated on his back-&#xD;
ward retreat.&#xD;
" I-I--I p-pro-test against the impropriety !" he stammered&#xD;
forth, looking back at the women, with a very pale face, -as he&#xD;
accelerated his backward movement before the steady stride of&#xD;
the resolute doctor. -.-&#xD;
"Out with you, sir-T-I will answer for the proprieties in this&#xD;
case!"&#xD;
The door was slammed-in-the ashy face of the spiritual pro-&#xD;
fessor, and securely doubled-locked before the doctor returned&#xD;
to the bedside of his patient.&#xD;
The bleeding from the 'mouth 'had now ceased. All the&#xD;
usual remedies in such cases having so far entirely failed, the&#xD;
puzzled doctor had come to the final conclusion that the hemor-&#xD;
rhage--.be its seat where it might-was only to be subdued by&#xD;
a restoration of the patient to the most perfect repose. Sleep,&#xD;
calm, unbroken sleep, to his sagacious judgment and sensibili2&#xD;

ties, seemed to offer the sole alternative to death. He. had&#xD;
been impressed by his patient that her constitutional tendencies&#xD;
were, by a sad inheritance, towards consumption, and the loss&#xD;
from the lungs, of such quantities of blood as he had witnessed,&#xD;
was well calculated to fill his professional 'mind with horror and&#xD;
dread. The case had thus appeared to him a fearfully uncertain&#xD;
and delicate .ne; and this sense may fully account for the stern&#xD;
and unusual procedure of turning even the husband.out of the&#xD;
room on the two occasions we have mentioned.&#xD;
As her physician, he felt himself boundto protect his helpless&#xD;
patient against those moral causes of irritation which he had&#xD;
been led to believe existed, not only from her reluctant disclo-&#xD;
sures, but from what he had himself witnessed. Believing that&#xD;
her- beastly husband was the chief and immediate cause of this&#xD;
fatal irritation; he had felt himself justified in his rough course&#xD;
towards him, and was now fully and resolutely determined to&#xD;
protect what he considered a death-bed-providentially thrown&#xD;
into his charge-inviolate from farther annoyance, from what-&#xD;
ever quarter, at least so long as he held the professional respon-&#xD;
sibility. In this resolute -feeling, and as the. day was warm, he&#xD;
threw off his coat, raised' all the windows,.and sat himself quietly&#xD;
down beside his patient to watch for results.&#xD;
The eyes of the kind man very 'naturally rested upon the&#xD;
object of his solicitude, and after the first excitement of anx-&#xD;
iety was over, and he had settled calmly into a contemplative&#xD;
mood, he. first 'became conscious that there 'was something&#xD;
strangely fascinating in the. position of the nearly inanimate'&#xD;
figure. .He had never before thought of the being before him&#xD;
as other than a very plain, but much-afflicted woman, by.whose&#xD;
evident physical calamities, no less than her private sufferings,&#xD;
he had been strongly interested..'&#xD;
She had told him her own story, and. he had believed her,&#xD;
thinking he* daw confirmation enough in the conduct' of those&#xD;
she accused of ill-treatment; but the idea of regarding her as'&#xD;
attractive in any material sense, had never for an instant crossed&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN.                 41&#xD;
his pure soul. Now there was an indescribable something in&#xD;
her attitude, so expressive of passion,- that, in the pulseless&#xD;
silence, he felt'himself blush to have recognized it.&#xD;
Her arms, which he now remembered to have been bare in&#xD;
all his late interviews with her, were exquisitely.rounded and&#xD;
beautifully white, and he could not but wonder that he had not&#xD;
before observed the strange contrast between them and the plain&#xD;
weather-beaten face. They looked startlingly voluptuous now,&#xD;
contrasted with the pallid cheek which rested on them, and- the&#xD;
glossy folds of'dark hair in which they were entangled. So&#xD;
strikingly indeed -as this expression conveyed, that even the&#xD;
purple stains of blood upon the spread beneath' would not&#xD;
divest him of the dangerous illusion. Thegood doctor felt the&#xD;
blood mount to his forehead in the shame of deep humiliation&#xD;
as he recognisedin himself this wandering of thought.&#xD;
What! could it be that one so habitually pure in feeling as he,&#xD;
could permit-the intrusion at -such an hour of impure associa-&#xD;
tions ? Such things were unknown to his life, so disinterested,&#xD;
so spotless, so humane. What could it be that had caused&#xD;
such feelings- to possess him thus unusually? -It could _not ' be&#xD;
possible :she was conscious of the position in which her body&#xD;
was thrown. Was there some strange spell about this woman&#xD;
-some mysterious power of'sphere emanating from that still&#xD;
form, that crept into his blood and brain with the evil glow of&#xD;
these unnatural fires?&#xD;
The poor doctor shuddered as he turned aside from the bed&#xD;
and, with a soft step, glided to the window, and there seating&#xD;
himself, strove to recover the 'command of his thoughts by dis-&#xD;
tracting them with other objects in the busy street.&#xD;
The good man was on grievous terms with himself, as he&#xD;
continued to beat the devil's tattoo on the window-sill with his&#xD;
heavy fingers. He felt alarmed, nay, even guilty. He knew&#xD;
not why. We shall see!&#xD;

SHAKSPEARE.&#xD;
TNiE woman continued, with calm, regular breathings, to&#xD;
sleep for several hours. The dusk of evening had now closed&#xD;
in, and yet her patient guardian sat silentlywatching her motion-.&#xD;
less figure. A long and serene self-communion had gradually-&#xD;
restored the excellent doctorto his ordinary equaiimity, and he&#xD;
now, with untiring vigilance, awaited the changes that might&#xD;
supervene in the, condition of thepatient.&#xD;
After all his-thinking on the, subject, he found himself now&#xD;
no nearer comprehending the cause of the late unwonted'di-s-&#xD;
t rbance of his habitual serenity than at 'the beginning.,- He&#xD;
had dealt harshly with himself, in endeavoring to account for it,&#xD;
and never dreamed of reproaching the feeble and wretched&#xD;
being before 'him, as in any degree the conscious agent of what&#xD;
he considered a weakness unpardonable in himself.&#xD;
' With the natural proclivity of generous souls towards the ex-&#xD;
tremes, he had, in the plenitude of his seff-re roach, proceeded&#xD;
to exalt the sleeping woman into an earth-visiting angel with&#xD;
wounded wings, the spotless purity of which the breath of his&#xD;
darkened thought had soiled. The poor,' good-hearted doctor!&#xD;
The silence of the room was now broken by a low exclama-&#xD;
tion of fright, accompanied by a slight movement of the patient.&#xD;
The doctor sprang forward softly to the bed-side.&#xD;
"Who ?-what ?-where am I? What has been happening?"&#xD;
&#xD;
asked the woman, with an expression of bewilderment and&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
"Nothing ! nothing, my dear madam! I am here-you are&#xD;
safe -but you must not talk."&#xD;
"Where is. he? is he gone ?" she persisted in a wild, terrified&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
"Yes, he is gone. He shall not come back to disturb you&#xD;
again. You must be quiet now, and get well. Please be calm,&#xD;
and trust inime."&#xD;
" Trust in thee ?" said the patient, in a voice which had in-&#xD;
stantly lost its vague tone. "Trust in thee, thou minister of&#xD;
light, who hast come to my darkened pillow, to my bloody&#xD;
,death-bed, to console ne !". and" here she- clutched his hand.&#xD;
" Trust thee -I would trust thee as I' trust God!" and she&#xD;
pressed his hand to her heart.&#xD;
"You must be silent, madam,".urged the physician, endeavor-&#xD;
ing to extricate his imprisoned hand, for he- felt strange tin-&#xD;
glings along his veins, which 'alarmed his now penitent and&#xD;
vigilant spirit. She only shook her head, and clung with yet&#xD;
greater tenacity to his hand, and then, first raising it to her lips&#xD;
with a reverential kiss, she placed "it upon the top of her head,&#xD;
with the palm outstretched, and- signified her .desire that he&#xD;
should keep it there, with a smile of entire beatitude. The&#xD;
doctor barely knew enough of 'mesmeric manipulations; to un-&#xD;
derstand that this laying-on of hands was commonly resorted to&#xD;
among the believers in the science, as a remedy for nervous&#xD;
headache. He could see no harm in the innocent formula, if it&#xD;
assisted the imagination in throwing off pain, and he very&#xD;
willingly huniore4 his poor patient, in .permitting his hand to&#xD;
remain there.&#xD;
In a moment or two a singular change -came over the face and&#xD;
general physical expression of the woman, and-the doctor, who&#xD;
had witnessed something of mesmeric phenomena, instantly.re-&#xD;
cognised this-as clearly presenting all the symptoms of ~such a&#xD;
case. He had-mesmerised her by a touch, and it was not with-&#xD;

&#xD;
out a thrill of vague wonder that he awaited further develop-&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
There was a' perfect silence of ten minutes' duration, when&#xD;
the -mesmerised patient began moving her lips as if in the effort&#xD;
to articulate.  The curiosity °of the doctor -was" now fully&#xD;
aroused-his will became concentrated-he desired to hear her&#xD;
speak; in his unconscious eagerness, he willed that she should&#xD;
do so with all the energy of his firm nature; and speak she did-&#xD;
Happy! happy ! Ah, I, am content in .this pure sphere !&#xD;
Iy soul can rest here !" a long pause, then suddenly a shudder&#xD;
vibrated through her frame, and she shrank back as one appajled&#xD;
by some spectral horror.  2&#xD;
"Ha ! it is all dark now ! I see,! I-see ! his hand is red!&#xD;
red! red ! red ! There is murder on this soul !"&#xD;
The doctor sprang up and back as if he had been shot.- His&#xD;
face grew livid pale, and he trembled in every joint, while with-&#xD;
chattering teeth he stammered-&#xD;
"Woman! Woman, how know you this ?"&#xD;
" I see' it there -that huge 'red hand ! Now all is red !&#xD;
There ! there ! I felt it must be so !, The pale and golders light&#xD;
breaks through! It spreads! It fills. and covers everything!&#xD;
His heart did no murder-A--it was, his hand! He can be rdeemed !&#xD;
This soul is pure !"&#xD;
The poor doctor sank upon his chair and groaned heavily,&#xD;
while he covered his face with his hands. He spoke, in a few&#xD;
moments, in an almost inaudible tone, to himself, while the woo-&#xD;
man, who had suddenly opened her eyes, turned her head&#xD;
slightly, and watched him with a sharp attention.,&#xD;
" AlasI! alas! how came this strange being in possession of&#xD;
thefatal secret of my life ?- - I believed it buried in the oblivion&#xD;
of thirty years  My life of-dedication to humanity, since, I&#xD;
thought -might have atoned'. for that quick sad- deed ! Yes! I&#xD;
struck him !, 0, my. God-I struck him! but the provocation&#xD;
was most fearful!- Woman, who and what are you, that you&#xD;
should know this thing ?" and with a vehement gesture he jerked&#xD;
&#xD;
his hands from before his eyes, and turning swiftly upon her, he&#xD;
met the keen, still glance of those watchful eyes, which shone&#xD;
through the subdued' light of the room, steadily upon him.&#xD;
The doctor was astounded ! He sprang' to his feet again, ex-&#xD;
claiming angrily-&#xD;
"What shallow trick is this? You seemed but now in the&#xD;
mesmeric sleep, and mouthed to me concerning my past hfe,&#xD;
and here you are, wide awake-! How came-you with the secrets&#xD;
of my life ?"&#xD;
The woman answered feebly, and with a sob that at once&#xD;
touched the gentle-hearted doctor, and turned aside his wrath-&#xD;
" You took your hand away-you would not let me speak.&#xD;
Place your hand upon my head again, an'd I will tell you all."&#xD;
The troubled doctor re-seated himself with a shuddering&#xD;
reluctance, and renewed the manipulation.&#xD;
In a few moments she appeared again to have sank into the&#xD;
sleep, ;nd commenced in that slow, fragmentary manner supposed&#xD;
to be peculiar-to such conditions:&#xD;
" I see ! The dark shadow is on this soul again ! It is of&#xD;
anger and suspicion-they are both evil spirits ! They strive to&#xD;
make it wrong the innocent ! It is too holy and pure- to yield!,&#xD;
I see the golden light fill all again!- The bloody hand is gone.&#xD;
No stain -of crime remains upon this'soul. It will be pardoned&#xD;
of .God. - This soul needs only human love. Through love it&#xD;
can be made free before God ! All the past will be forgiven&#xD;
then-the red stains will fade! A sudden 'anger made, it sin.'&#xD;
Love can only intercede for this sin. Love will intercede! It&#xD;
will be saved !"&#xD;
Here her voice became 'subdued into indistinct mutterings,&#xD;
and the doctor drew a long breath as he withdrew his hand-&#xD;
"Singular woman! How could all this have been revealed&#xD;
to her'? She must comunine with spirits in this state. My story&#xD;
is not known to any here. I never saw or heard of her, until sent&#xD;
for as a physician, to visit her in this. house. Strange that this&#xD;
fearfully passionate and repented deed should thus rise up in my&#xD;

path, thousands of miles away, amidst strangers, who can know&#xD;
nothing of ie ! Oh, my God! my God ! Thou .art indeed&#xD;
vengeful and just !" and the miserable man clasped his hands&#xD;
before his' eyes and moaned. "Jt was my first draught of love&#xD;
and life. He dashed it! -I was delirious in my joy, while the&#xD;
beams rained from her eyes into my hungry soul-hungry of&#xD;
beauty and of bliss, He dashed it all, and in the hot blood of&#xD;
my darkened uiadness- I slew him!. Oh,. I slew him ! His&#xD;
shadow, that can never be appeased, though I have: given body,&#xD;
and soul, and substance,'to relieving the sufferings of my race,&#xD;
since that unhappy hour-it rises here again ! It haunts .me"!&#xD;
Yes! yes! I feel that love alone can-make me strong once more, to&#xD;
bear such tortures! But have I not denied myself such dreams?&#xD;
Have I not with dedicated heart walked humbly since in, self-&#xD;
denying ways? Have I not' clothed the orphan, fed the poor&#xD;
and nursed the sick ? Have I not ministered amidst pestilence,&#xD;
and held my life as of none account that I might bring good to&#xD;
others.? Can I be'forgiven ? No!' no ! The Pharisee recounts&#xD;
his holy deeds and thanks.God that his life is not sinful as an-&#xD;
other man!. I am not to be forgiven! I shall never know those&#xD;
dreams of 1ove~"'&#xD;
The strong man .bowed his frame and shook with agony.&#xD;
Could he but have looked up, a keen, quick 'gleam from the eyes&#xD;
whichh had been so steadily fixed, upon him during this painful&#xD;
soliloquy, would have struck him as.conveying the ecstacy of a&#xD;
sainted spirit over a soul repentant - or of some other feeling&#xD;
:quite as exultant.&#xD;
This curious scene was, however, most unexpectedly inter-&#xD;
rupted at- this-moment, by 'a loud yelling from the street below.&#xD;
The clamor.was 'so sudden, and yet so angrily harsh, that both&#xD;
parties 'sprang forward in the alarm it -cause4-the woman,.&#xD;
springing up into a sitting posture on the bed, and the doctor to&#xD;
go 'to 'the window.&#xD;
"What is it?" she exclaimed wildly, as she tossed back her&#xD;
hair.- " What do these cruel people want to do to me now ?",&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHEBIAL SOFTDOWN.                47&#xD;
The doctor, who saw at a glance the- meaning of what was&#xD;
going on below, and the necessity of keeping -his patient cool,&#xD;
turned to her, with a very quiet expression--&#xD;
"Do not be alarmed, madam. It is merely some disorderly&#xD;
gathering of rowdies, in the street below. There is no dange&#xD;
to you-only do not get excited, or you will bleed again. I am&#xD;
here to protect you."&#xD;
" Then I am safe !" was the fervid response, which, however,&#xD;
was followed by a roar so sullen and portentous, from the infu-&#xD;
riated mob underneath, as to leave some dohubtof its truth even&#xD;
upon the mind of the doctor.&#xD;
" Down with the anialgaitation den !"&#xD;
" Down with the saw-dust palace!"&#xD;
"Tear it down!"&#xD;
"Let's lynch the wretches !"&#xD;
The response to speeches of this sort, from single voices,&#xD;
would be a simultaneous burst of approbation from the great&#xD;
crowd, and a trampling and rush to get nearer the building., It&#xD;
seemed a formidable sight, indeed, to the doctor, as he looked&#xD;
down upon this living mass of men, surging like huge waves&#xD;
tossed against some cliff, while the torches, that many of them&#xD;
bore,. glared -fitfully upon the upturned, angry faces.&#xD;
A powerful voice, which rose above all the tumult, exclaimed&#xD;
with a hoarse oath, as the speaker turned for an instant'toward&#xD;
the crowd, from the top of the front steps-&#xD;
"Let us burst open the door and lynch -every white person&#xD;
found with a negro. Here goes for the door !" and he threw&#xD;
himself furiously against it, while a perfect thunder-crash of,&#xD;
roars attested the approbation of the dangerous mob. The door&#xD;
resisted for a moment, when there was a sudden yell from the&#xD;
outside of the mob, nearly a square distant-&#xD;
" Here ! here 's what'll do it ! pass 'em on-!"-and the alarmed&#xD;
doctor saw immediately the portentous gleam of fre-axes, which&#xD;
were being passed over the heads of the' crowd towai-ds the&#xD;
door, and in another instant the crash of the' cutting would&#xD;

commence. The doctor, as we have seen, was a very prompt&#xD;
man. He thrust his head out of the window, and in a loud,&#xD;
commanding voice, shouted-&#xD;
"Stop !"&#xD;
The man at the door, who had just received the axe, and was&#xD;
in the act of wielding it, paused for an .instant, to look up, while&#xD;
the whole sea of faces was raised toward the window, amidst a&#xD;
moment's silence, of which the doctor instantly availed himself---&#xD;
"Gentlemen, do you war upon women? I have a female&#xD;
patient here, in this room, at the point of death ! If you pro-&#xD;
ceed, you will kill her !"&#xD;
"Who is she ?" shouted some. one, while another voice, in a&#xD;
derisive tone, yelled'out amidst screams of laughter--&#xD;
" Is she 'Rose? Rose? de coal-brack Rose ? I wish I may be&#xD;
shot if I don't lub Rose !"-&#xD;
Amidst the thunders which followed, some one shouted from.&#xD;
a distant part 'of the mob, to the man with the axe-&#xD;
"Go on, Jim! It's all pretence with their sick women!"&#xD;
".Down with the door-they don't escape us that way ! Look&#xD;
out for your bones, old covey, when we catch you !"&#xD;
The axe was again swung back, but the doughty doctor still&#xD;
persisted--&#xD;
"Stop !" he shouted again, in a tone so startling for energy&#xD;
of command, that the axe was again lowered.&#xD;
" Are you.Americans ? Have you mothers and sisters ?"&#xD;
'Yes, but they ain't black gals!" gibed one of the mob, and&#xD;
set the rest into a roar once again.-&#xD;
"I -appeal to you as men-as brothers and fathers, do not&#xD;
murder my poor patient!"&#xD;
" Who is that noisy fellow ?" bellowed a brutal voice below.&#xD;
"I am a physician ! I have nothing to do with this house&#xD;
or its principles ; I only beg to be permitted to save my patient !"&#xD;
" What, is your name, I say ?" bellowed the hoarse man again.&#xD;
"Out with it! We''11 know you-some of us!"&#xD;
The'name was ,mentioned. There was a momentary pause,&#xD;

" We know you!&#xD;
"Just like him.!"&#xD;
"Noble fellow!"&#xD;
." The good doctor! 'Huzza-! huzza!",&#xD;
And soothe cry went up on all sides, for the, doctor's reputa-&#xD;
tion for benevolence was as wide as that of John Jacob Astor&#xD;
for the opposite trait.&#xD;
There seemed to be a vehement consultation. among what&#xD;
appeared the leaders of the mob, which lasted but for a moment&#xD;
or two, when one who, stood upoi the top step looked up, and&#xD;
in a firm,, respectful voice, said to the doctor-- -&#xD;
 " It's all right, sir, about You! We shall let the women pass&#xD;
out!' But you must clear the house of Ahem !" ..&#xD;
 " But it is" dangerous to move my patient."&#xD;
" We cannot help that, doctor ; we do this for your sake, not&#xD;
theirs, for they ought every one of them to be. burned, and we&#xD;
are determined .to- abatethe nuisance.of this house. So hurry&#xD;
them along here quick,for the boys-will- not keep quiet l9ng."&#xD;
" Yes, hurry them women along; we'll let them: go. this&#xD;
time."&#xD;
" All but that lecturing lady (?), who says that, she would as&#xD;
soon marry a negro asa white ma !"&#xD;
" Yes, all but her; we want to e rid of sch creatures; let's&#xD;
duck her in the Hudson."&#xD;
"No, boys, we will make no distinction. We have pro-&#xD;
'mised -- let the  woman  go.'?.'sj&#xD;
"Down with the lecturing women and their black lovers !"&#xD;
" Duck.the hag ! we'll:wash off the scent for her !"&#xD;
'Cries such as these' convinced the doctor that indeed no time&#xD;
was to he lost, particularly as .:the sound of the axe, was now&#xD;
heard below in good earnest. Approaching the bed "hastily,&#xD;
he took the 'shivering form of the, panic-stricken woman, who&#xD;
had heard distinctly these last -omirious cries, into his arms.&#xD;

is she, that lecture-woman; shewants to marry a nigger, hah!1&#xD;
We won't let her go."&#xD;
"But you will!" said the doctor, releasing one' arm, with&#xD;
which he struck .the ruffian directly in the mouth, and with a&#xD;
force that sent him reeling backwards.&#xD;
":Good! good !" shouted:twenty voices; "served him right,&#xD;
doctor."&#xD;
The 'fellow had rallied instantly, and was ru hing, like a wild&#xD;
bull, headlong upon the doctor, when several powerful -men&#xD;
threw themselves between the two, seizing the ruffian at the&#xD;
same time.&#xD;
"No, Jim, you stand back!" said one df them, brandishing&#xD;
a heavy axe before his eyes. "You touch that gentleman again,&#xD;
and I'll brain you!"&#xD;
"It's a shame !" interposed others: "It's the good doctor&#xD;
who nurses the poor for-nothing. Doubt if he gets a ceilt for&#xD;
that creature."&#xD;
"Yes,'if she was the devil's dam herself, we promised 'the&#xD;
good man to let her go. Stand back, boys, and let the ' doctor&#xD;
pass."&#xD;
An opening was accordingly formed, through which the&#xD;
doctor hastened to make his way. When he made his appear-&#xD;
ance at the door, he was greeted With three wild, hearty cheers&#xD;
for himself, and as many groans and hisses for the character of&#xD;
the woman whom he' bore, the news of- the identification of&#xD;

through the. crowd, with the purpose of bearing her to the&#xD;
sheler of his own bachelor home.,&#xD;
The mob- now instantly occupied the building, which was&#xD;
.gutted by them, and the shattered contents, along with its' oceu-&#xD;
pants, men and women, roughly hurled into the street. Some&#xD;
of the former were very severely handled, and among the rest,&#xD;
the Spiritual 'Professor had his share of material chastening.&#xD;
The: mob found him under a cot-bed, with three ors four femi,.&#xD;
nine disciples of'his spiritual correspondences .piled over him,&#xD;
or clinging distractedly to=his nerveless limbs.&#xD;
1ey dragged-him out by the heels, with his squalling cor-&#xD;
tege trailing after him, and finding that the occult professor of&#xD;
spiritualities had gone-into. a&amp;amp; state of obliviousness, or rather&#xD;
fainted, they proceeded, in their solicitude: for his recovery, to&#xD;
deluge his person with.sundry convenient slops,,which-'shall "be&#xD;
nameless, and 'afterward's kicked him headlong into the street&#xD;
below, where the dreaming boys' pelted him with gutter-mud&#xD;
and rotten eggs,-until, finding his spiritual legs,' as he had been&#xD;
advised - it is.to be supposed-- of a sudden, he made himself&#xD;
scarce, down Barclay Street, in an inappreciable twinkle..&#xD;
In a word, the people., in this instance, as in many others,&#xD;
when they have found-it necessary to take -the laws of decency&#xD;
and .comrnon sense 'into their own sovereign hands, did the work&#xD;
of ridding themselves of-this most detestable nuisance effect-&#xD;

knows who its heroes are, is another question,'and one more&#xD;
open to controversy: "Now I insist that the world does, not&#xD;
know, or else Boanerges Phospher, the Spiritual Professor,&#xD;
would long singe have been stoned and persecuted into one of&#xD;

men. There is the fierce, aggressive heroism of the soldier and&#xD;

Ah, verily--and this ishe-!-our Spiritual Professor! .Born&#xD;
n:Yankee-land,:of course, the earliest feat of -Boanerges Phos-&#xD;
pher-iterally, aciorging to his own account of it---was to pry&#xD;
up a liuge stoneupon one- of the- sterile pernal acres: for what&#xD;
purpose, would you suppose? -To -place his feet upon the soil&#xD;
beneath,'because the foot 'bf no other man could have pressed'it!&#xD;
A laudable ambition, truly,. but one which, somehow, un-&#xD;
luckily,'-suggests that-&#xD;
"Fools may walk where angels fear to tread I"&#xD;
It was- a necessary.seucence to the career of this modern Co-&#xD;

to the facility of whining he had acquired, in his more juvenile&#xD;
experience, -as a preacher of some:three or. four different liberal&#xD;
sects.;- We class these as -mere experiments, as purely preliini-&#xD;
nary trials of strength, before he entered the true arena of his&#xD;
professorship.&#xD;

of hair-invigorating oils, professors-of dancing, professrof rats&#xD;

-and why not a professor of elocution?-- The very igutter-mud&#xD;
germinites professors in this free country.f They grow like&#xD;
fungi out of wallowing reptiles''heads.; and who need be sur-&#xD;
prised, in America,. at receiving the card of his boot-black,&#xD;
inscribed Professor Brush ; his chimney-sweep, Professor SootI&#xD;
or be appalled by the bloody apparition of a rmissive -from his&#xD;
butcher, emblazoned, " Professor Keyser, Killer ! '&#xD;
No disrespect, mark you, is intended to be either understood&#xD;
or implied, for the gentlemen of the various professions above&#xD;
enumerated, for they are all respectable in their way,' and to be&#xD;
respected,- outside of their professorships. ~ But- that is rather a&#xD;
serious name, as we understand it-one that the world has been&#xD;
accustomed to look up to with veneration -proportioned, until&#xD;
these"' modern instances," to the vast 'and profound learning&#xD;

ence," in precipitating the discovery of this r great mine of the&#xD;
niwtalso much in favor with the'sages ,above mentioned-arnd the&#xD;
remainder ,f the sect to which the Professor. belonged--the&#xD;
motto of,which'is, that, "Out of the youths of babes and, suck-&#xD;
lings shall ye, be eopfounded."  Yet- we can, freely venture to&#xD;
assert, that he had Rno 'connection whatever with those unfor+&#xD;
tunate commerciall results, which, in the first place, nearly,&#xD;
if not entirely, swamped the great Patron of the- enterprise.&#xD;
The miid of our Professor was necessarily not of that vast reach&#xD;
and ge eralising comprehension, which could lead to the Behe-&#xD;
moth stride and wizard calculation of results, which had enabled.&#xD;
his master thus confidently to 'speculate in so subtle a material.&#xD;
The operations of our Professor were essentially minified ;,&#xD;
that is, their sphere and scope had been particularly narrow.&#xD;
He was. heroic enough, Heaven knows; but then his heroism&#xD;
was f that.dashing character which only required a patron to&#xD;
lustrate and make it known.&#xD;
Having published a book upon this- occult (in his hands)&#xD;
science of' elodttioi, which was, of course, written for him by&#xD;

He had already taught; men how to talk, and it now became&#xD;
'necessary; and ind ed spiritually incumbent upon him, to teach'&#xD;

New York paper, for a long period, daily, between '43 and&#xD;

ritual Professor was in his glory now.&#xD;
An illustrious man lived once in Sweden. He was humble,&#xD;
pure and firm., 'His astonishing works on seientiic subjects left&#xD;
the 'mind of his period ffar behind him, utterly confounded by&#xD;
his direct' and stringent-:lucidation- of the most' subtle of the&#xD;
purely physical l.aws. 'It seemed a miracle to.them; they found&#xD;
their professional accuracy so faf surpassed, thatthey durst nrot&#xD;
do more than wonder. Work after work of this amazing intel-&#xD;
lect came forth, dressed in i language, while handling such&#xD;
themes, common to the world of science&#xD;
Then came a sudden change, and this vast mind, which here-&#xD;
tofore had dealt in simple demonstriationwith 'mankind, threw&#xD;
down its"compass and its squares, :and, in the language of hu-&#xD;
milty,' proclaimed itself a Medium' The' God of Jacob.and&#xD;
humanity had revealed hirpself tohin,' not-in the burning bush&#xD;
of mystery, but in the lustrous quiet of a calm repose.' He had&#xD;
talked scieiific truth before, "but now:-he spoke -of spiritual&#xD;
things-a chosen Medium between God and man'! His theme&#xD;
was far beyond all science. We-have nothingto. do withhis&#xD;
wide postulate; his name was too. sublime and venerable-among&#xD;
the patriarchs of 'mankind, for 'me to speak of it, otherwise- in&#xD;
this connection, than in disgust and loathing of the profanation&#xD;
to which it has been' subjected, in our country,' by monkeyisii&#xD;
and parrot-tongued -ignoramuses.&#xD;
Our learned and sagacious Professor of' Elocution, happening&#xD;
to stumble upon .soie of the earlier translations of the worksof&#xD;

had now learned to rad without spelling the words out loud, he&#xD;

of regarding certain subjects with the profoundest -veneration,&#xD;
and our modest and capable teachers with reverence. But the&#xD;
very length of this programme, and the enormous stretch of the&#xD;
themes, only go, I suppose, to illustrate the hardihood of our&#xD;
" admirable Crichton," the professor of the- occult-and the&#xD;
genial and the generous-to call it by its lightest name-gulli-&#xD;
bility, of his gaping audience.&#xD;
Forth went these flaming announcements day by day, on&#xD;
thousand hot-pressed sheets, until.New York became all agog,&#xD;
and the great mass conceived that they had found a new prophet.&#xD;
All its spectacled and thin-bearded women forthwith were in&#xD;
arms; the Professor wore his hair .behind his ears, and, of&#xD;
course, was the soft and honey-sucking seraph of their, dreams.&#xD;
He could be indeed nothing short of seraphim-revealed, for&#xD;
he discoursed with them in winning tones of mists and mysteries.&#xD;
He told them bald tales of angels with whom he had been on&#xD;
terms of intimacy; for he sagaciously kept his master, Sweden-&#xD;
borg, mainly in the background throughout.&#xD;
Representing himself, as the - individual recipient of these&#xD;
revelations, from the spherical ladies who wear wings, and who&#xD;
are habitually designated as. angels by both the sexes, on our&#xD;
little clod of earth, our champion became, of course, the hero&#xD;
of all such semi-whiskered maidens or matrons, who, though&#xD;
essentially "pard-like spirits," were 'yet, to reverse the words&#xD;
of Shelley, more "swift," alias "fast," than " beautiful!"  It&#xD;
is, of course, to be comprehended that beauty is comparative as&#xD;
well as wit, and we would no more be understood as insinuating&#xD;
that these thinly-hirsute virgins and dames, who at once con-&#xD;
stituted the principal audience of the mighty Professor, were&#xD;
themselves in any degree deficient in sympathy either with the&#xD;
man and his profound doctrines, or the man per se, than that&#xD;
we would assert they understood one word of what he mouthed&#xD;
to them, with his hair behind his ears.&#xD;
Boanerges Phospher, the Spiritual Professor, Was successful,&#xD;
and never was there anything so professionally brilliant as the&#xD;

crowded houses that he nightly drew. -The immense Tabernacle&#xD;
seemed a mere nut-shell; he could have filled half-a-dozen such&#xD;
houses nightly. The mob had grown excited by the novelty.&#xD;
The paper of the Patron Saint, at so -many pennies aline, day&#xD;
by day, continued to.prostitute its columns to this vulgar trap&#xD;
of silly-servant-maids ad profound clerks,&#xD;
The Professor's lectures were attended by countless swarms&#xD;
of inquirers after truth, who, as they were willing to accept a&#xD;
-'spoken for a written language of which they knew nothing, per-&#xD;
mitted him to stumble through propositions, which, in them-&#xD;
selves, were so ridiculously absurd as even to disarm contempt&#xD;
in the wise, and make denunciation ?harmless as superfluous.&#xD;

THE bowels of:-Boanetges Phospher, the Spiritual Professor,&#xD;
were possessed of such extraordinary capacity for yearning over&#xD;
the fallen and lost condition of his brothers of mankind, that,&#xD;
not content with saving them by wholesale, and nightly, in those&#xD;
marvellously spiritualized lectures, his indomitable energies took.&#xD;
up the trade of "saving" men idividually and;by detail.,&#xD;
This, let it be understood, wasdone between times, by way&#xD;
of recreation, just to keep his hand in. Let us follow him on&#xD;
one of these eriads of mercy.&#xD;

ETHERtAL sOTDOWN.       .&#xD;
In a poor garret of Ann Street, New York, might have been&#xD;
seen, about these days, a young man, seated in a Tickety chair,&#xD;
beside, a: dirty pine table, which was plentifully strewn with&#xD;
manuscripts covered with many a tedious column of figures and&#xD;
mysterious-looking diagrams.&#xD;
You saw at once, from the disproportionate size of the broad,&#xD;
white,.bulging brow, which brooded heavily over large moirn-&#xD;
ful eyes, and thin, emaciated features, that he was a mathema-&#xD;
tician; possessing one of those precocious and enormous de-&#xD;
velopments of the organs of calculation, which are so apt, when&#xD;
not diverted by other occupations -and excitements, to consume&#xD;
rapidly the feeble fuel of life in their consecrated fires.&#xD;
A wretched cot-bed occupied one corner of the room, which&#xD;
was likewise. strewn with papers and books on mathematical&#xD;
subjects, while on the. mantel lay scattered little heaps of dri~d&#xD;
cheese and crusts, which seemed so hardened, that no tooth of&#xD;
predatory mouse had left its mark thereon.       -&#xD;
The young- man was dressed in entire conformity with the,&#xD;
miserable appearance. of the room.: His thin and. silky hair&#xD;
hung in lank, clammy locks about his shockingly pallid features,&#xD;
as he leaned forward on his elbow, his -forehead resting heavily&#xD;
on his thin hand, as he pored overthe papers before him.&#xD;
" Ah me,"- muttered he, "this horrid poverty !" and he threw&#xD;
down his pen and sank back with a faint, despairing movement.&#xD;
" My brain is giddy with this :dizzy round of figures, figures.&#xD;
My weary calculation is nearly done, but my over-tasked, brain&#xD;
sickens. Ah, but for just one good meal, to strengthen me for&#xD;
a few hours, and I could finish it -finish my glorious work!"&#xD;
At this moment a rapid. step was heard ascending the creak-&#xD;
ing stairs ; the door flew open rudely, and, without any' an-&#xD;
nouncement, the Spiritual Professor, .with. his hair all nice&#xD;
behind his ears, came bustling forward toward the table, beside&#xD;
the fainting young-student. Rubbing his hands at the same&#xD;
time in prodigious glee of anticipation, he exclaimed -&#xD;

64              SPIRITUAL VAMPIRISM.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ha! my son! my spiritual child! how is it with you?&#xD;
Have you finished ? Is-it done ?"&#xD;
The poor student shook his .head slightly, and muttered&#xD;
feebly -.&#xD;
"No, no; I cannot finish it."&#xD;
The eager face of the Professor turned suddenly very blank&#xD;
and very white at the same time, as, straightening himself, he&#xD;
stammered out&#xD;
"Wh-what ! c-cannot finish it'! You must finish it! you shall&#xD;
finish it!" and then continuing with greater vehemence, without&#xD;
apparently noticing that the weary head of the poor being before&#xD;
him was slowly droopingyet lower.-&#xD;
"Here's a pretty business, to be sure!. This is the reward I-&#xD;
am to get for all I have done for you-for all my efforts to ad-&#xD;
vance you in the world  for all the heavy expenses I have&#xD;
incurred in bringing you on from Cincinnati, and supporting&#xD;
yob here ! The evil. spirits must have re-entered the boy!&#xD;
Have I not striven for these six months faithfully, with all my&#xD;
spiritual strength, to.drive them forth, that I might save him?&#xD;
The boy:must be born again-he must be regenerated once&#xD;
more. Cannot finish it! He. must. be chastened, to rebuke&#xD;
this evil spirit in him; he must be reduced to bread and water.&#xD;
I must .recall my liberal allowance for his food; he has been&#xD;
living too high. The .evil demon has probably. entered him&#xD;
through a meal of fat pork !" and the spiritually outraged Pro-&#xD;
fessor :sniffed with an indignant and eager sniffle, that he might&#xD;
detect the presence of the.forbidden food.&#xD;
The poor youth,-in the -mean time, had been slowly sliding&#xD;
from his chair, and, as the' Professor turned aside with the air&#xD;
of an injured cherub, the body lost its balance, and the faint-&#xD;
ing youth fell to the floor.&#xD;
"-Ha!. what-now ?" shouted our cherub with the hair behind&#xD;
his ears, springing into the air with a nervous agility, as if he in&#xD;
reality .wore wings. He placed himself on. the opposite'side of&#xD;
the room in a twinkling, and then turning his face, ghastly with&#xD;
&#xD;
fright, exclaimed, "I thought the house was coming down!"&#xD;
and seeing the prostrate body, he walked around it as cautiously&#xD;
as a cat crouches, and, with a stealthy inspection, peered into the&#xD;
half-open eyelids, at the upturned eyes, but without"touching&#xD;
the body.&#xD;
" Wh-why, the fellow's gone and died! There goes my&#xD;
great speculation!" and springing back suddenly, he rushed&#xD;
towards the table, and seizing convulsively the papers, ran his&#xD;
eye eagerly over them, while his hands trembled violently; and&#xD;
his lips turned as ashy blue as those of the poor victim at his&#xD;
feet, while, with an expression of despair, too unutterable for&#xD;
words to paint, he groaned out in frantic exclamations "No,&#xD;
no, no, it is not finished ;- nobody else can do it but him I'm&#xD;
ruined ! I'm rained'! Oh, my money's\gone -my money's&#xD;
gone ! To think that he should die, after.all I've done for him.&#xD;
-after all my liberality! 0! 0! O! boob! boobh! hoo!"&#xD;
At this melting crisis, a slight noise caused him to. turn "his&#xD;
head ; the apparent corpse was 'drawing up one foot, and mak-&#xD;
ing some other feeble movements,-which showed that life was&#xD;
not entirely extinct.&#xD;
At this sight the eyes of Boanerges flew open as wide iri a&#xD;
stare of ecstacy, as they had before' been stretched in horror,&#xD;
until their suffusion "with the briny," as Mr. Richard Swiveller&#xD;
would say; had caused them to momentarily wink.&#xD;
".Why, he ain't dead yet ! my .speculation is safe. Some&#xD;
water ! Where's some water? Get some water!" and he ran&#xD;
peering and dodging around the room with an uncertain air, as&#xD;
if the new influx of joy had bewildered his seraphic, mind.&#xD;
After some little delay he found the pitcher, which had. been&#xD;
standing alt'the time in full view, within three feet of him; he&#xD;
wildly dashed more than half the contents into the face of the&#xD;
victim, who instantly drew a lqng sobbing breath, and in a mo-&#xD;
ment or two opened his eyes.&#xD;
This so increased the ecstacy of the Professor, that he now&#xD;
ventured to kneel beside him, and, in his eagerness, forgetting&#xD;

&#xD;
to use the tumbler that was standing near, he nearly crushed the&#xD;
poor student's teeth down his throat, in his awkward endeavors&#xD;
to administer drink tohim from the heavy pitcher--exclaiming,&#xD;
during the process,. ".Drink! drink! my son. Don't die, for&#xD;
Heaven's sake ! Remember, my liberality-my generous sacri-&#xD;
fices to advance you in the world. Remember our almanac -&#xD;
your great work, that is to make your fortune.- Remember how&#xD;
you have been saved !"S&#xD;
" Starved, you mean," feebly whispered the young man,&#xD;
whom a few draughts of the precious fluid had rapidly revived.-&#xD;
y"-St-a-a-r-r-ved! does he -say ?" yelled Boanerges, shrinking&#xD;
back as if horrified, and nearly dropping the body he was sup-&#xD;
porting from his arms. Then, suddenly releasing one arm, he&#xD;
smoothed back his hair gently; that radiant, angelic expression&#xD;
of sweet humility, for which it was so famous among the female&#xD;
pag of ,his select and nightly audiences, overcame his face as&#xD;
ia halo, and leaning down,-so as to look into the eyes of&#xD;
his -ictimi he asked, in a liquid voice,- " My son, have I-have&#xD;
I.- thy spiritual- father, starved thee ?" and then tenderly he&#xD;
gazed into his eyes. With, a look of assured self-satisfaction&#xD;
that those siren tones had done the business, he silently awaited&#xD;
the answer to the gentle and rebukeful question. But no an-&#xD;
swercame to the. sweet, lingering look ; -the young man only&#xD;
closed his eyes heavily, and shuddered. .&#xD;
"My. son, my son !" continued the Professor, in yet more&#xD;
grieved and -meek, and dulcet tones. "fVIy spiritual son, have I&#xD;
starved the-? have I not been generous to a fault, and even to,&#xD;
wronging',the beloved 'child of my own loins? This room,'&#xD;
these writing materials, this tumbler, this pitcher, that delightful&#xD;
bed, are they not all my .free-will gifts to thee for thy own ad-&#xD;
ancement, to enable thee to glorify God in thy works? Have&#xD;
I Dot. rather saved thee from starving? KYou had nothing when&#xD;
I took you ap, to patronise your genius, and. bring you before-&#xD;
the world ; and now you have plenty! See, see, your mantel&#xD;

E&#xD;
&#xD;
is even now crowded with bread and cheese, that you .re&#xD;
wasting here in the midst of such superlative abundance.'&#xD;
The young man, at the mention -of the bread' and cheese,&#xD;
turned his head aside with an expression of bitter loathing and&#xD;
disgust.&#xD;
" Pah!" he muttered; "the very name of it makes me sick;&#xD;
I have tasted nothing else for the last six months. That is&#xD;
what is killing me ; my stoniach can retain it no longer! Who&#xD;
can keep body and soul together on thirty cents a week ?"&#xD;
" Horror !" exclaimed the Professor, rolling up his eyes&#xD;
meekly. "To think of such frantic extravagance!' Andbe-&#xD;
sides, my son, your spiritual strength should. have sustained&#xD;
you -the success of your great work, the prospect of future&#xD;
glory! A man starve on bread and cheese ! Why, who ever&#xD;
heard of such a thing? -Why, when I was a boy of ten years&#xD;
of age, I started alone, on foot, to, cross the Alleghanies,,to&#xD;
make my way to the North to school. My father had moved&#xD;
West when I was very young. I started with only one loaf of&#xD;
white bread in my bundle, when the whole country was wild&#xD;
and full of bears and wolves. The:wolves chased me, and I&#xD;
climbed a tree; they surrounded it, barking and gnashing their&#xD;
teeth, to get at me; there were five hundred-wolves at least,&#xD;
but I in my faith kept my strength, and remained cool as Daniel&#xD;
in the lion's den, until at last they kept me' there so long, I fell&#xD;
asleep, when the limb broke, and I fell down into the midst of&#xD;
them; the wolves were so frightened, that they all took to their&#xD;
heels and ran away, leaving me safe. There is 'a specirien of&#xD;
the spiritual strength that faith gives,-and should encourage you&#xD;
never to give up and faint by the way. Had you possessed&#xD;
more of such faith, my ,son, you would -never have been&#xD;
stretched here, upon this floor, in such a: condition, and talking&#xD;
about starving on bread and cheese. It is the soul, my songthe&#xD;
regenerate soul, that sustains the heroic man on earth, as I have&#xD;
so often endeavored to teach you."&#xD;
"Yes," groaned the poor youth, with a gesture of impatience.&#xD;

"The body must live too, and life.cannot be sustained so long&#xD;
upon unyaried food."&#xD;
If Listen, my son !" said 'the patient saint at his head-&#xD;
'listen) and you shall hear what I accomplished on that single&#xD;
loaf of bread. I travelled on 'with my little-bundle on my&#xD;
shoulder, containing the home-spun suit I was to wear when I&#xD;
arrived at schoolgand my loaf of bread. I travelled on till-my&#xD;
clothes were all worn out, and .my shoes full of holes, and my&#xD;
feet were so sore and swollen that I was afraid to pull ofl my&#xD;
shoes, for fear I should not be able "to get them on again. So I&#xD;
waded across all the brooks and mountain streams with my&#xD;
clothes on, until,-at last,, one afternoon, when high up in. the&#xD;
mountains, my strength gave out, and I laid me down in the&#xD;
howling wilderness, thinking I must die. The weather was&#xD;
Very cold,: and my clothes, all wet from crossing the streams,&#xD;
freezing, and the dreaded sleepiness was coming over me,&#xD;
en a good wido* woman,swho lived, with her children on the&#xD;
mountains, and was out gathering wood, accidentally found me.&#xD;
She took me up in her arms, and carried me to her hut, and&#xD;
laid me on her bed, where I slept all night. In the morning,&#xD;
when I opened my eyes, I. saw her breaking the hot Indian-corn&#xD;
bread, and ,giving it to .her children. I toldher if she would&#xD;
give' me :some of her corn bread, I would divide my loaf of&#xD;
white bread' with her and her children.  She eagerly ac-&#xD;
cepted the offer, for such a luxury as white bread had been&#xD;
long 'unknown to them, and_ that was my first speculation!&#xD;
While they ravenously devoured my loaf, I feasted upon her&#xD;
rich hot bread. My soul overflowed with delight as I witnessed&#xD;
their- intense enjoyment of the meal I had been thus instru-&#xD;
mental' in bringing them, 'and I felt as if the Lord had thus&#xD;
enabled, me to fully repay them for their kindness. I rose to&#xD;
depart, and the good woman, filling my bundle with a large'&#xD;
piece of her hot bread, sent me, with her blessing, on' my way&#xD;
rejoicing. Thus, you see, my dear son, how, through the-spi-&#xD;

I was enabled to cross the Alleghany mountains alone, at ten&#xD;
years of age, with nothing but my loaf of white bread, and with-&#xD;
out so much as a bit ofA cheese,,or a cent in my pocket, and&#xD;
attained to the great goal of my ambition, the school; and from&#xD;
whence, by the aid of selling an occasional button from my&#xD;
jacket, I have been able to rise to my present position as pro-&#xD;
fessor and patron of struggling genius.*&#xD;
" Ah !" said the young man, " words, words.!   Give me to&#xD;
eat -I am starving!" and his head sank back once more.&#xD;
The Professor again- deluged him with water, and,'profoundly&#xD;
surprised and alarmed that the honeyed eloquence of his saga-&#xD;
cious narrative had'proved unavailing in convincing-his victim&#xD;
that he could and ought'to live upon faith, came to the desperate&#xD;
resolution of being guilty of the extravagance; for once, of a&#xD;
small bowl of soup to resuscitate his victim, and depositing his'&#xD;
head upon some books, though the pillow was equally cote-&#xD;
nient, he hurried off to the nearest eating-house, with hishnds&#xD;
upon his pockets, which were overflowing with gold, as he Was&#xD;
then in the, meridian height of his prosperity.&#xD;
The sequel to this particular story is a short one. The young&#xD;
-g&#xD;
man revived with the change of a single nutritious neal, and&#xD;
with it returned the courage of even the trodden worm; for he&#xD;
now stoutly told the Spiritual Professor that, unless he furnished&#xD;
him with ample means to support life, he would :not touch an-&#xD;
*Incredible as it may seem, we pledge our personal veracity that this&#xD;
bald and silly narration, which appears to be merely a foolish' bur-&#xD;
lesque, is a bona fide, et literatim, et punctuatim, transcript, as close as&#xD;
it is possible for memory to furnish, 'of stories that were, at least as&#xD;
often as five days out of the seven, related at the dinner-table at which&#xD;
Boanerges presided, to long double lines of gaping women, who, obe-&#xD;
dient to the irresistible spell he bore; had-followed up this maudlin&#xD;
Proteus of Professors, as disciples of water-cure, through his latest meta&#xD;
morphoses, into physician of such an establishment in Boston. It was&#xD;
thus he exhorted them to faith, and encouraged his backsliders.&#xD;

&#xD;
othefigure of the immense and complicated calculations on.&#xD;
which he had been so long engaged.&#xD;
The Professor, of course,:resisted to the last, and quoted the&#xD;
correspondences upon him, with desperate fluency. But when&#xD;
the young man coolly seized the manuscript on the table before&#xD;
him, and -held it overthe flickering flame of the miserable dip&#xD;
candle, which had now been of necessity lighted, the Professor,&#xD;
sprang forward to arrest his hand, shrieking --&#xD;
"I will! I will! .for God's sake, stop.!-how much do you&#xD;
want?"&#xD;
"Five dollars a week !" was the cold response, as the flame&#xD;
caught the edges of the paper.&#xD;
I'll give it! I 'll give it! What fearful extravagance ! My&#xD;
God! put it out!"&#xD;
"Pay me five dollars at once," said the other.&#xD;
.Here it is-here it is!" and he jerked, in his excitement,&#xD;
from"his pocket, a dozen gold-pieces of that value, and dashed&#xD;
them upon the table.&#xD;
" Take your fivedollars! put it out !";&#xD;
The young man quietly swept the pieces within his reach into&#xD;
a drawer, which he at the same moment opened; and, extin-&#xD;
guishing the.margin of the manuscript,:which had burned slowly&#xD;
from its'thickness, he replied deliberately to the Professor, who&#xD;
had shrieked .out -&#xD;
"Do you mean to rob me ?"&#xD;
"No, sir ! but I mean to keep this money, and if you ap-&#xD;
prgach me,,.I shall destroy this manuscript if it cost me my life.&#xD;
You have-starved and outraged me long enough; you expect&#xD;
to make- a fortune off my labors, and kill me with famine just&#xD;
as my work is done. But with all my humility, abstraction and&#xD;
patience, this is too much ! I am roused at last, in self-defence,&#xD;
and you shall find it so!"&#xD;
The Professor sank into a chair as if fainting; and for some&#xD;
moments continued to mutter, with more than the magnanimity&#xD;
of a sick kitten ---&#xD;

Here, to my very face !  What have. I gained by saving&#xD;
him?"                                   }&#xD;
This last expression was gasped'out, as if the vital breath of&#xD;
the speaker was passing in the final spasm.&#xD;
The scene need not be prolonged. The valorous Professor&#xD;
crept away, cowed beneath the cold, firm, lustrous eye of the&#xD;
now aggressive victim, Whose enthusiasm for science and earnest&#xD;
self-dedication, had 'heretofore .kept himn blinded to a full reali-&#xD;
sation of all the, monstrous iniquity which had so long been&#xD;
practised upon his abstracted, meek, and uncomplaining nature.&#xD;
He now determined to take his life into his own hands, ,and saw&#xD;
clearly through all the shallow and ridiculous pretence.of patr9n-&#xD;
age and "saving," by which his single-hearted fervor had been&#xD;
beguiled.&#xD;
In a few days it was announced to the Professor, whose-faith&#xD;
and spiritual strength-the same that had scared off the wolves&#xD;
when he fell among them-had in the interval been, restored to&#xD;
their equilibrium, that the great work was now con pleted, and&#xD;
the announcement was accompanied by a proposition on the&#xD;
part of the young mathematician to sell out to him entire his&#xD;
copyright share in the whole enterprise, at a price so compara-&#xD;
tively insignificant, when the rofessor's own florid anticipations&#xD;
of future results were consi ered, that he sprang at the offer&#xD;
eagerly, and thus possessed himself at once of- the "golden&#xD;
goose.-&#xD;
The young mathematician disappeared, and the Professor was&#xD;
left exulting in the sole possession of what seemed to him, in&#xD;
vision, the nearest representative of the gold of'Ophir,' not to&#xD;
speak of California.&#xD;
The idea of the young mathematician was, in itself; a prae-&#xD;
tical one, and seemed rationally conceived.&#xD;
We have used the word almanac, by which it was designated,&#xD;
but in reality it very poorly conveys the subtle and singular&#xD;
combinations which were here brought to bear upon a circular;&#xD;

rotary surface, the aim of which was, to so far simplify the cal-&#xD;
culations of - interest, wages, discounts, and.a hundred other&#xD;
tedious and.difficult problems occurring in complicated business&#xD;
affairs, that the merchant or banker had only to glance his eye&#xD;
down a line of figures, to ascertain in a moment results which&#xD;
would take him, by all the ordinary aids and processes, a long&#xD;
calculation to arrive at.&#xD;
It was a brilliant conception, which must prove ultimately a&#xD;
most successful discovery;'of the young mathematician, and one&#xD;
which had cost him many years of careful analysis and profound&#xD;
observation. But as he handed over the perfected copyright to&#xD;
our astute Professor, who had just enough of button-trading cun-&#xD;
uning to perceive the immense practical results of the enterprise,&#xD;
without the slightest knowledge.of the processes by which it had&#xD;
been perfected, there might have been noticed upon. the face&#xD;
of his former victim, as he pocketed his paltry bonus, a slight&#xD;
sneer, which would have alarmed any one less gifted with occa-&#xD;
sionalshort-sightedness than our Professor has shown himself&#xD;
to be.,&#xD;
He made off with the documents in an ecstacy of triumph,&#xD;
and forthwith began making round purchases of paper, paste-&#xD;
board, and other mechanical appliances necessary to his success,&#xD;
to the amount of thousands of his easily-got gains ; and then as&#xD;
heavy-sums were as rapidly expended upon the costly and diffi-&#xD;
cult copper-plate engraving, which was to set forth in full the&#xD;
triumph, the undivided honors of which he now claimed, to the&#xD;
world.&#xD;
There are few of the main printing-offices in the country&#xD;
that had not, or have not, that famous circular almanac hanging&#xD;
upon their walls. Unfortunately the Professor had been too&#xD;
eager to promulgate his triumph, and powerfully illustrated in&#xD;
this experiment the truth of the old aphorism, "The greater&#xD;
haste. the less speed;" for it turned out, upon a close examina-&#xD;
tion of the long and intricate series of calculations, by scientific&#xD;
men, that the fatal error of a single numeral ran throughout its&#xD;

SPIRITUAL VAMPII$M,'&#xD;
It is latef on a dark stormy evening, and we will look 'into&#xD;
thwell-stocked half libraryand half'office of a handsome pri-&#xD;
vateresidence in Beekgan Street, New York.&#xD;
Theushioned appliances of the most fastidious luxury of&#xD;
 repose were strewed about theroom in the strangest disorder of&#xD;
heaped cushions,,fallen chairs. and 6ot-ofsplace lounges while&#xD;
books, surgical instruments, vials, dusty,. crusty, broken; and&#xD;
corkless, all mingled in the 'desolate confusion which seemed to&#xD;
have usurped the place.r&#xD;
{A shaded' lamp stood upon the table in the -centre oftthis&#xD;
chaos, and threw itsalight upon a large decanter of brandy and&#xD;
ar glass- :eneath. A  deep-drawn meaning sigh -disturbs the&#xD;
deathlike 'silence of the -room ; 'and a broad, stout figure,'which&#xD;
had leaned 'back within' the shadow of a huge= cushioned chair&#xD;
beside the table, reached suddenly forward 'and chitched the&#xD;
brandy-bottle convulsively. He dashed a great gulp into the&#xD;
glass, and then, with treinbling hand, attempted to carry it to&#xD;
his lips. After two or three efforts, which proved unavailing&#xD;
from his excessive nervouiness, he replaced the glass, muttering,&#xD;
" Curse this nervousness!' It-will not even let me, drink my&#xD;
poison any more !" ' He shuddered' as.he turned his head away.&#xD;
" No wonder! how horribly the hell-broth smells!" 'He fell back&#xD;
into the-deep chair again' and was silent-for some time, when,&#xD;
uttering from- the depths of his chest that strange moan, he&#xD;
sprang to his feet.&#xD;
"I mustdrink!" he gnashed,- as, seizing the decanter again,&#xD;
he filled the tumbler to overflowing, splashing the dark fluid&#xD;
over everything' on the table  I shall die if I do not drink !&#xD;
T shall:go crazy:! I will not be baffled!"&#xD;
Without' attempting to raise it again to his lips, he bowed&#xD;
them. to the brimsing- glass,iand' as the beast drinks, so drank&#xD;
he. Oh, fearful degradation!. Where now is the strong man? -&#xD;
that powerful frame would speak. After leaning the tumbler&#xD;
with his lips and trembling hands in'a long, deep diraught, he'&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL SOFTDOW.&#xD;
&#xD;
'  S&#xD;
&#xD;
straightened himself with an expression.,of loathing that distorted&#xD;
his face hideously.&#xD;
" Paugh ! Hell should mix more nectar with its chiefest&#xD;
physic ! This"stuff is loathsome, and my revolting nerves seem&#xD;
with a separate life to shudder as the new babe- does to, hear the&#xD;
asp hiss amidst' the flowers where it sports! Paugh!  infernal!&#xD;
that it should come to me in this short time, even as a second&#xD;
nature, to learn to feed on poisons! It -was not so once,; nature&#xD;
was sufficient, aye, sufficient, when the skies 'rained glory 'out&#xD;
of day, and the stars came .dowti in beamy strength through&#xD;
night !, But then!-but then! Ahyyes ! it had not beco ne ne-&#xD;
cessary then, -that I should be s-a-v-esd 'by human love !" and&#xD;
his features writhed as he' prolonged the word;-"S-a-e-d!&#xD;
no! no ! no heavenly guise of horrid lust to s-a-v-e me ! The&#xD;
chaste and blushing spring came to the early winter'-of my ste-&#xD;
rile life that bloomed beneath its radiant warmth, and gladdened&#xD;
to grow green and odor-breathed and soft, and then! oh, horror!&#xD;
horror. .I am strong enough to -drink again. -'My nerves are&#xD;
numbed now; they dare not tremble."&#xD;
He seized' the decanter once mre, and then, with unshaking&#xD;
hand, conveyed the brimming glass to his lips, and after a aleep&#xD;
draught threw,himself upon the chair again, and drawing. at the&#xD;
same time a glittering object from his' breast, 'he leaned forward&#xD;
within 'the circle of the lamp-light toregard it as it lay open upon&#xD;
the. table before him. This is- the first timewe have seen that&#xD;
face clearly-that haggard, pallid face. Ha! can it be ? T1Lhose&#xD;
sunken, bloated cheeks! Those dimmed, hollow eyes, with&#xD;
leaden, drooping' lids ! -0, can it be ? Have we.known that&#xD;
face before ? -God help us-!, The good Doctor ! and only one&#xD;

But see the change ! His, eye has rested upon, that face before&#xD;
him. A, miniature, beautifully executed. ' In it a charmed art&#xD;
has presided at.a miracle! an arch seraphic brow all usunnied&#xD;
o'er' by the golder'eflex from-its'tangled curls, broken in beam&#xD;
and shadow, gracefully glanced a gay defiance in" his eyes,-from&#xD;

less than all divine, but that the sweet mouth spoke of earth, and&#xD;

ee how theace of that sad and broken man is changing !&#xD;
thpse shrunk and heavy features are re-lit with life, as some dead&#xD;
waste'with sunshine, suddenly; The .bright,the tender past;&#xD;
the; meliwed   mournful past, ha   mounted to the eyes and&#xD;
flushed those massive features.once again. He seems as one&#xD;
transfigured for a moment, while he gazes.. The glory of old&#xD;
ini ocenca has' compassed him about,:alas! but for a moment!&#xD;
'he fears pbur flooding from his eyes, and-hlot the facewhereon&#xD;
he gazes. A sob-that wild an d'piteous moan again-and the&#xD;
palsied wreck of the strong man falle back once mere into his&#xD;
cushioned chair. A horrid, stertorous breathing, most like that&#xD;
of a dying man, -flls the gloomy air of that dim room, and with'&#xD;
ashyolips and ffglen jaw, he sleeps! Ah, that seems a fearful&#xD;
sleep ,with the tears, warnr tears, still pouring, pouring down&#xD;
the rigid cheek!&#xD;
The shaded lamp 'burns on,:and fitfully the chaos of that&#xD;
room, heregard, there, is, touched by its faint light. A slight&#xD;
sund, a rtstling tread is heard, and in a moment, a woman-&#xD;
dressed in black,iwith a black veil about her face, and he um-&#xD;
brella which had protected he~r from the -storm in~ her hand, stood&#xD;
beside the sleeper.. She. evidently had a passJkey,' for she&#xD;
walked forward as one, accustomed to, use it at all- hours and&#xD;
confidently.&#xD;
{The beast !- Drunk,. dead drunk -again !" she muttered.&#xD;
"I shan't get. the money I wanted to-night, that is plain! Curse&#xD;
his obstinacy !. After all 'my trouble -to save him, this is my&#xD;
reward! Worse and worse!"r&#xD;
She sprang forward eagerly as her eye fell upon the jewelled&#xD;
miniature that 'lay before:him 'on the table, and. snatched it up.&#xD;
"Ha ! this will save me some trouble!"  She' turned it eagerly&#xD;
over in her hands, 'throwing back her veil' at the same time, to&#xD;
examine the valuable case with vivid glistening eyes, that did&#xD;

And she drew herself erect with a triumphant -swelling of the&#xD;
whole frame, which seemed to emit, for the moment, from its&#xD;
outline, a keen quick exhalation most like-the heat-lightning of&#xD;
,a sultry summer sky.&#xD;
- She fills the decanter rapidly from a demijohn she drags from&#xD;
a closet in the roomandplaces it by his side..She pushes the&#xD;
water-pitcher far beyond his reach, and then steps forward for a&#xD;
moment into the light.'&#xD;
Have we ever seen that face before ? -No.! no! It might&#xD;
have been-there is some resemblance-but this form and face&#xD;
are too full of arrogant abounding strength to be the same faint&#xD;
bleeding victim of. ruthless persecution that we saw at first !&#xD;

Her strong toils of grace.&#xD;
, KSHAKSPEARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
TAKE we a glimpse now of another interior scene in -the&#xD;
strange,. mingled lifeof the great metropolis. In a bare and&#xD;
inanly-furnished- but roomy parlor of a house in Tenth St-eet,&#xD;
near Tompkins Square, we find assembled; on one' summer's&#xD;
afterrioon, a group of females. There are perhaps- ten of thenn&#xD;
irl a:  'he characteristicwhich'first strikes the eye, on glancing&#xD;
aroi nd this group, is the strange angulaity of lines presenteI&#xD;
eveyWhere, in faces, figures and attitudes, except when con.&#xD;
trasted with an uncouth and s uabby embonpoint, which seemed&#xD;
equally at variance with tfie physical harmonies, supposed to be&#xD;
characteristic of the sex. What' sl 'tis meant, you could&#xD;
not comprehend at first' glance '; but the impression was, of&#xD;
something "out of joint.' Where or what, it was impossible&#xD;
to conjecture. Some sat-with their'bonnets on,which had a&#xD;
Quakerish cut about them, though not strictly orthodox. "Some,-&#xD;
donsciou. of fine' hair iad tossed their: bonnets hn the floor or&#xD;
chairs; as.the case might be. There-was, in a word, a prevail-&#xD;
ing atmosphere of steadfast and devil.-nay-care belligerence ---&#xD;
a seeing, on brow, in hand ,andsfoot, that, demurely restrained,&#xD;
as it',certainly was, unconsciously led you to- feel 'that a slow&#xD;
and simtltaneous -unbuttoning of the cuffs of sleeves, a del-&#xD;
berate rolling up' of the same, and a dazzling' development'of&#xD;
lean, taut tendons, corrugated muscles, and swollen veins,&#xD;
would be, the' most natural - movement conceivable. Not that&#xD;
this bellicose sentiment, by any means, seemed to have found&#xD;
its proper antagonism  in the forms and personalities then and"&#xD;

there presented; but that you felt, in the vacant reach.. and per-&#xD;
sistent abstraction of the expression, that the' foe, at whom they&#xD;
gazed through the infinite of space, was not an yIdividuality,&#xD;
but an Esence, - a world-devouring element' of Evil, with&#xD;
which they warred.    "'                    "-f&#xD;
And warriors indeed they seemed-we should sag Amazons--&#xD;
wielding,; not the weapons .of carnal strife, but those mightier&#xD;
arms with which the Spirit doth, at times, endow our race. As&#xD;
for the war they waged,. whatever might be the power with&#xD;
whom they were engaged, it seemed to. have been a protracted&#xD;
and a: desperate one; for, verily,,judging from, the harsh lines&#xD;
that seamed the faces of those present, one would imaginethern&#xD;
to be " richpanly in large hurts"&#xD;
. There were .young ,women present who were clearly under&#xD;
twenty; whose foreheads, when they elevated their eyebrows,&#xD;
were wrinkled and parchment-like as any.&#xD;
"Painful warrior famoused for fight."&#xD;
Why this unnatural 'wilting'? would be the-certain question&#xD;
of the cool observer. What'fearful wrongs have these women&#xD;
suffered? What- "contagious blastments ?" Is the wicked&#xD;
world arraigned against -them for no just cause ? Has it doin-&#xD;
bined its respirimig 'masses nto one -large, simultaneous breath&#xD;
of volcanic cursngs, to be wreaked upon their uneffendig&#xD;
heads alone ? To be sure;&#xD;
" Some innocents capee not the thunderbolt -"&#xD;
and can it be that these, too, are "innocents ?" It-is' true, phy&#xD;
siology teaches that, when women wither prematurely, acquire&#xD;
an unnatural sharpness of feature, become&#xD;
"Beated and chapped with tanned antiquity,"&#xD;
before they have seen years enough for the bloom of. the life of&#xD;
true maturity to have freshened on their cheeks and foreheads-&#xD;
there must be' some cause for it. Common. sense teaches, too,&#xD;
that that cause is most likely to -be, originally, ratliera physical&#xD;

than a spiritual one-that mental aberration, dogged and sullen&#xD;

alities,, and much enduring 'syrmpathies of those around them,&#xD;
whose lives are intact-or, in other words, who have held them-,&#xD;
selves, ikrhealth, through- nature, near to God - must have its&#xD;
source in some evil not'entirely foreign to themselves.&#xD;
Ask the wise 5Physician why are these things so  'He will&#xD;

we live in'it, we must conform to its laws; that, however pow-&#xD;

She to whom the place of presiding Pythoness seemed to&#xD;
have' been, by general understanding, assigned, ow solemnly&#xD;
arose, amidst a sudden pause of shrill-tongued clatter. ,iShe&#xD;
was',very tall- nearly six feet  Her straight-figure'would have&#xD;
seemed vgluptuously rounded, but that the loose-folded, and&#xD;
wilted oval of her face suggested that the plump bust, with its&#xD;
close, manly jacket of black velvet, buttoned down in front,&#xD;
might owe something of -its elastic seeming roundness to those&#xD;
conventionalities, a la modiste; and otherwise, against which&#xD;
her principles most vehemently'protested.  Her, flaxen hair&#xD;
emulated the. classic tie of any Venus of-them all, onthe back&#xD;
cart ofthe head; while the effulgenceof sunny curls flooded,&#xD;
the very crow's-feet in the corners of her g'eat, cold, dead,&#xD;
grey eyes.&#xD;
She shook her, curls slightly, and spoke: -&#xD;
"hy sisters, we have cometogether this afternoon, not to talk'&#xD;
about abstractions of right and wrong to out sex; for, upon all&#xD;
these -elementary subjects, our ninds are, fully made up -all&#xD;
those inductive. processes of which the human intellect is capable,&#xD;

our minds have already passed through. Qur opinions are irrevo,&#xD;
cably formed, our conclusions absolute! -Woman is oppressed&#xD;
by man. She is denied her just rights. She is taxed, yet ;de-&#xD;
nied the privilege of representation. She is a slave, without&#xD;
the privileges of slavery;! for, in -the old slave-states, the pos-&#xD;
session of twenty, or thirty, or forty slaves gives to their master&#xD;
the faintly-representative privilege of an additional vote, while&#xD;
to' our tyrants, though each may hold,yin reality,-_a dozen wives,&#xD;
the law grants nothing! Leaving us, in ,fact,, not even the&#xD;
'shadow of a shade' of a social or civil existence!t We. are&#xD;
thus reduced to a condition of insignificanee, in relation to . the&#xD;

A small noise--a} scarcely sensible ."teetering  of pedal ex-&#xD;
tremities upon the thin carpet, followed this " stern" demnonstra-&#xD;
tion" of "womari's rights," from the accepted Priestess'of -the&#xD;
conventicle; when various exclamations arose from different&#xD;
parts of the room,.such as-&#xD;
"Right;! right! End justifies the means, in dealing with the&#xD;
brutes.!&#xD;
"'They.give us no quarter, and-we will give them none !"&#xD;
"Nurse their brats, forsooth" P&#xD;
"We must circumvent them    as we can; to obtain our&#xD;

"Yes! yes! All stratagems are fair'in love and war !"'&#xD;
Suddenly sprang to her feet a very emphatic Stouttwoman,&#xD;
straight and thick-set, with soiled cap, coarse, stubby, grayish&#xD;
hair, sparse, silvery bristles on her chin, gray, savage eyes, and&#xD;
large fists, which she brought down with a, crash'iipon the; frail&#xD;
chair-back which constituted the bulwark of her position. In&#xD;
a voice of creaking'bass; she exclaimed-&#xD;
"Te' sister is right -they are our oppressors ; but it is be-&#xD;

upon my ' woman's rights ! (A general disposition to laugh,"&#xD;
which was, however, frowned down by the dignified Priestess.)&#xD;
" It is- truemy sisters; we.have only to,. assert our rights,&#xD;

instead of being slave to. him, he is your slave. This is what&#xD;
we want. When he can be reduced to obedience, then he will&#xD;
be happy; for when he has accepted us as his spiritual guides,&#xD;
and no longer dreams of lifting his thoughts in rebellion, then&#xD;
will he always go 'right. They then eves are for ever confess-&#xD;

their greatness, all their goodness. Let us take the hint, and&#xD;
hold the spiritual birch over them always, and they will ever&#xD;
remain obedient, for their'own good."&#xD;
This speech was received with very general approbation;&#xD;
though, that all did 'not 'recognise it as orthodox, became imme-&#xD;
diately^ apparent. A tall, thin, cadaverous-looking lady, with&#xD;
excessively'black hair; aid eyes that literally glistered as she&#xD;

uriforunb system  by which we should. be enabled to. accomplish&#xD;
this _result'that wer came together this afternoon. It -has been&#xD;
well said, that our' motto should be, 'The end justifies the&#xD;
neans.' To 'the weak and the _deterniiined, this is a-sacred&#xD;
creed,'and we should go forth with it in our hearts, and act&#xD;
upon it in all our relations towards. men. It should be our&#xD;
business to get possession of them, body-and soul. We need&#xD;
their influence, to advance our views, to obtain our rights. We&#xD;
should be all things to all men;- should believe in the Bible, in&#xD;
Fourier, in Swedenborg, in-Joe Stith, or Mahomet, if neces-&#xD;
sary, so that the influence be gained. We must seek out every-&#xD;
where men who hold places of power-and public influence, and&#xD;
win them-not to ours oause, for that would be hopeless  but&#xD;
to ourselves ; and through ourselves to our cause.  We must&#xD;
not scruple as to the means; for 'the end justilie sthe means.'&#xD;
We must find, by whatever stratagem,=art, or intrigue, that&#xD;
may be available,,the assailable points in the characters" of those&#xD;
who may be of use to us, and secure them, at whatever risk'of&#xD;
reputation; for, as we'will secretly sustain each otherr' we will&#xD;
at once dignify ourselves and our cause into the position of&#xD;
martyrdom, and be able to take shelter behind the omnipotent&#xD;
cry of persecution. There we are safe."&#xD;

beaten face, ,--that is, the forehead, .2-of the lithe, glib speaker&#xD;
flushed with momentary exultation, while she continued, with&#xD;
still greater emphasis&#xD;
" Thus banded, my sisters,- if -we are firm, faithful, and en-&#xD;

when there is' more then a dozen men who wield its destinies.&#xD;

Storms of applause,,during which the' plain, Quakerish-looking&#xD;
speaker subsided into her seat. As she did so, there might&#xD;
have been observed, under the flush of exultation which man-&#xD;
tied her brow, a singular obliquity of the. left eye! -'Ha!&#xD;

WE will now enter one of the upper rooms of the notorious&#xD;
Graham House, with the interior of which we have before been&#xD;
familiarised; and, which had' been reopened, on a 'modified&#xD;
basis. A single glance at the confused piles of manuscripts,&#xD;
books, and papers, scattered about the 'room and on the table,&#xD;
mingled with stumps -of pens and cigars, ,and a' long-tubed&#xD;
meerschaum, showed, that it could "be no other than the charac-&#xD;
teristic den of a literary bachelor, who, with chair: and table&#xD;
drawn close to the stove, sat there to show for himself,'ear-&#xD;
nestly, engaged in what seemed to be the business of his life -&#xD;
writing.&#xD;
You ,saw in a moment that this- was not a Northern 'man, for.&#xD;
in addition to the long,.black, and wavy hair; the dark, bronzed,&#xD;
and vaulting features indicated clearly.a Southern origin. He&#xD;
was' evidently young-certainly- not more than twenty-seven,&#xD;
-judging, as one instinctively does, by.contour of person. and&#xD;
features, and not by the expression of these face. -But that  ex-&#xD;
pression, when you sawit; as,-he.lifted his head, at once,left you&#xD;
in doubt whether 'it could possibly belong to so immature a&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL. SOFTDOWN.-               89&#xD;
period of life. Although the brow was broad, and mild as that,&#xD;
of a child, yet there was a solemn and unnatural fixedness in&#xD;
the whole face, which, united with the cold stillness of'the great-&#xD;
gray, hollow eyes, told at once a dreary tale of suffering, which&#xD;
sent an involuntary shudder through your soul. Where the ex-&#xD;
pression rested most, it was impossible for you to, tell; but the&#xD;
feeling it conveyed was one of absolute horror. T'Ihat-a face,&#xD;
which seemed so young, should be .one tihat' nver smiled! -&#xD;
And could the.story that it told be true ? : Could-it be that for&#xD;
years that face had never smiled.?&#xD;
A light tap was heard at the door, and, with a momentary&#xD;
frown of vexation at the interruption,-he turned his head, and&#xD;
a young man entered the room, with, somewhat hesitating step,&#xD;
which showed that he was by no ,means certain of .his ground.&#xD;
He was slight and thin something below the average height,&#xD;
with even a darker complexion than that of the 'face we have&#xD;
just described;xhis black hair,.-and preternaturally black ,and&#xD;
vivid eyes, glitteredbeneath straight, heavy brows, whichrnearly&#xD;
met. '.'His nose was prominent and partly arched ;.and there&#xD;
was, in the whole bowed 'bearing and cat-like gait of this per-&#xD;
son, an inexplicably strange and foreign look, which, alike in&#xD;
all countries, characterises that fated race which is yet an out-&#xD;
cast among the nations.&#xD;
His greeting was singularly expressive of eager:ap reciation,&#xD;
while that of his host to him was cold, distant,' and merely&#xD;
polite. Pushing aside his writing materials, as he handed him&#xD;
a chair, Manton-for such was the name of our young writer- -&#xD;
turned upon his visiter a 'frigid look of:inquiry, and said, with&#xD;
a formality almost drawling&#xD;
Doctor E. Willamot Weasel, Ihope it is well with youi this&#xD;
evening?"&#xD;
His visiter, in rather ,a confused -manner, commenced-&#xD;
"Ye-es, yes-I--.I fear I am intruding on'-yout seclusion ; but&#xD;
p-pardon n, I cannot bear any longer to see you thus seclude&#xD;
yourself from all the amenities of social life.' You need relaxa&#xD;

Detecting a shade of vexation, at this juncture, crossing the&#xD;
open"'brow of Manton, Doctor Ebenezer Willamot Weazel hast-&#xD;
ily" reiterated his apologies.&#xD;
I-beg of you not to mistake my zeal for impertinence. I&#xD;

you against this' dangerous_ and' obstinate' isolation 'from  all&#xD;

"My good friend, Doctor Weasel, :ny life is my Qwn, and&#xD;

'But, sir," persisted the Doctor, "she. admires your papers&#xD;
so fervently, and pities the cruel and selfinfilicted isolation in'&#xD;

genius may find- a warm place to nestle, in distant lands,&#xD;
and near the matronly bosom, in spite of cold and sullen self&#xD;
reliance!"&#xD;
"c The fact of her beinga-matron," frigidly responded Manton,&#xD;
considerably modifies the general character ofthe proposition&#xD;
which she has done rpe the honor, through you, to communicate.&#xD;
But, Doctor, I must finally and definitively state to you that I&#xD;
do not, at present, wish to cultivate any female acquaintance&#xD;
whatever in the city 'of New York. I propose to wait until I&#xD;
can select instead of being selected."  And rising at the-same&#xD;
time with an impatient movement, which might or might not,&#xD;
be mistaken for a ,desire to be left 'alone, Mr.' Manton politely.&#xD;
showed Doctor E. Willamot Weasel, who had now taken the&#xD;
hint, to the door.&#xD;
Almost the same moment after- his discomfited visiter left,&#xD;
Manton. hastily gathered, up the scattered leaves of manuscript&#xD;
on his table, and muttering, as he thrust the roll into his} pocket,&#xD;
"Curse the intrusion! this ought to have been in the printers'&#xD;
hands an hour ago, and yet it is not finished !" and snatching&#xD;
up his cap, he passed from the room, and left the house..&#xD;
Not long after; there' came a sharp ring at the door of, the&#xD;
Graham House, and the female servant,-who hurriedly hastened&#xD;
to open it,,was quite as sharply interrogated by a woman on the&#xD;
outside, who was closely veiled, and wore a sort of Quaker&#xD;
garb -&#xD;
"Is Mr. Manton in ?"&#xD;
"No, ma'am, he has just gone out."&#xD;

" It -ufust, he finished tonight ! a, an has no right to be tired !"&#xD;
He was drawing his writing materials towards him, to proceed&#xD;
with his work, when a something of' strange disorder among his&#xD;
papers 'caught his quick eye.&#xD;
"Ah whq has been:disturbing my papers ?"and as a flash of&#xD;

" my trunks, no doubt, have shared the inquisition!" and, step-&#xD;
ping quickly to them, he threw up the lids.&#xD;
- "By Heaven, it is'so! what-accursed carelessness this is 'of&#xD;
mine, leaving everything unlocked in this fashion!"&#xD;
His first glance had shown 'himl that the trunks had beentlis-&#xD;

as they were before. Uttering some energetic. expletives_ of&#xD;
wrath, he knelt beside one to ascertain how far the-examination&#xD;
had been carried, when, reaching.-he packages of letters and&#xD;
papers:at the:bottom,'he saw-there, too, unmistakable evidence&#xD;
of a pretty thorough' examination having been held of- their&#xD;

If he had been enraged before, this illed himgith 'uncon-&#xD;

The very thought was horror-loatping'! A shudsler of un-&#xD;

ade ro tragic start; he stood still, with his arnms chitching&#xD;

to pierce to some far object. He at length pronounced slowly-.&#xD;

Starting suddenly forward,.he'commenced pacing to and fro&#xD;
with long strides; with knitted 'brows, compressed lips, and&#xD;
eyes bent upon the floor.-For 'more than an ,hour he ,thus&#xD;
silently communed with himself, without, the changeof a muscle&#xD;
in expression, when drawing a long sigh, he threw off this'&#xD;
frigid look in a degree, 'merely .saying -in a low voice,' "My&#xD;

almost every conceivable expression, tossed theI letter from' him&#xD;
as, he finished it, with the -exclamation-"Pah! this'. must be&#xD;
Doctor E. Willamot Weasel's lecture-woman!" Impudent '.ad-&#xD;

proceededwith the work before him, without paying anyfurther'&#xD;
attention'to the. circumstance.&#xD;
The greater portion of the'night was spent in intense labor;&#xD;
but, when, after a very late bath and breakfast, the next -mrn-&#xD;
ing, Manton went out to theoffice of the Journal for an hour,,&#xD;
end returned,11e was snot a little surprised to find another missive,&#xD;
asreatand-snowyas the first, awaiting' im, on the table.-&#xD;
He thought it must surely bethe first, that he had in some&#xD;
unconscious- mood, re enclosed in the envelope; but glancing&#xD;
around, 'he. saw it lying open, where he had tossed it.'&#xD;
tramercy!-but she fires fast!" he said, with a droll look&#xD;
passing -across his features, ashe stooped down, his hands cau-&#xD;
tiously clasped behind his back, to survey more closely the-deli&#xD;
cate superscriptionn -- Mr. Stewart Manton, Graham  House&#xD;
Present.&#xD;
"Present!:present! but this sounds rather ominous! Can it&#xD;
be, that A3y spiritual correspondent of last night is an inmate&#xD;
too?  My:correspondent is evidently both in earnest and in a&#xD;
hurry! What- shill I do? .yl3'myfaithI have a great mind&#xD;
to thr6w it.upon the centre-table of the common parlor below,&#xD;
and let this benevolent lady reclaim her own, or- else'leave it to&#xD;
the irresistible access of curiosity, 'common to the sex, and pe-&#xD;

-T-e-firsitaste 'has quite sickened .me. I= have something-other&#xD;
to do tha iilisten to such inane, twattle,"&#xD;
He continued for some moments to gaze upon the letter,&#xD;
while a half-sneering smile played 'upon his, grave and melan-&#xD;
cholyfeatures."' Well, but this must be- a quaint specimen of&#xD;
a feminine,;to: say the least  of it! I have heard of-these spi-&#xD;
ritual ladies. before ! The character must be worth studying,&#xD;
though it seems -to be transparent enough,,toq.  Well! we'll.&#xD;
see what she hits 'to say this ,i.tne; at any-rate'! It can hardly&#xD;
be richer than the frst! -Here it is!"&#xD;
&#xD;
FRIEND - I know your heart. That proud heart of yours is&#xD;
at this moment filled 'with saorn for my poor words and humble&#xD;
proffers. - Butit does, not affect re mtch,for well I know that&#xD;
this pride:is-the evil which ever strives in the -unregenerate soul,&#xD;
to fence against- the approaches of good. # As -yet this -demon&#xD;
possesses thee, and; until conquered and humbled by love, you&#xD;
can never -:be saved. Thy physical life- is poisoned --is: poi-&#xD;
soned with tobacco = and it is through 'such poisons that. this&#xD;
evil spirit of pride enters into thy, soul. -Thyspiritual vision is&#xD;
thus obscured, that, you may not perceive the truth. I shall&#xD;
pray for you.  My- spirit shall wrestle with thine when 'you&#xD;
know it not, and God will help his humble ntrument. May&#xD;
He soon move that obdurate heart of thine, proud boy!&#xD;
1A-RIE&#xD;
"Well! but this is cool! decidedly refreshing! This perti-&#xD;
nacious- creature is surely some mad- woman confessed, as she&#xD;
certainly- is a most raging- and impertinent fanatic'! .Boy,'for-&#xD;
sooth! j'atronising. I' should almost be provoked, were not&#xD;
the thing so egregiously ludicrous! 'Well, well"it is consoling,&#xD;
at least, that I have 'found my. good Samaritan at last: .I shall&#xD;
preserve these precious epistles, as decidedly curious memoranda&#xD;
of this original.type of the Yankee -adventuress, for Yankee 'she&#xD;

spiritualities. - I think I 'have had enough- of this -trash now, as I&#xD;
'intend to take no.notice either of it or of the writer. I should&#xD;

The letters were thrown carelessly into 'a drawer, and Man-&#xD;
ton sat down to his work. -,&#xD;
The next morning, when' Manton returned from the office, at&#xD;
the usual hour, what, should meet his eye, the first-thing on en-&#xD;

conspicuously, on the very centre 'of the table. The poor man&#xD;

out-&#xD;

ie snatched- up the note, and opening it, read it sotto voce,&#xD;
with an indescribable intonation of contempt:&#xD;
FAnIT--Ah, glorious soul, that  Imight call thee so indeed!&#xD;
I have just read your poem'in the Journal. Read it, did. I say?&#xD;
My soul has devoured it! Again and again have I returned'to&#xD;

cately-handled crow-quill! Curse it! I' shall order the cham-&#xD;
bermaid to stop the nuisance of these missives !"&#xD;
This letter was impatiently tossed into the drawer 'with' the&#xD;
others, and Manton threw himself into, his chair ; when, after&#xD;
sitting with his head leaning on hishands, moody and motion-&#xD;
less, for some time, hesuddenly straightened himself, and drew&#xD;
from the heap of magazines and books before-him a fresh-look-&#xD;
ing copy of the --Journal. Turning o'er its leaves eagerly&#xD;
to that which contained his pew poem, he perused it and re-&#xD;
perused it over and over again, with an expression of restless-&#xD;
ness and intense inquiry in his manner 'during the time.&#xD;
At last he drew a long breath, and threw the book 'back upon&#xD;
the table, exclaiming' in a..firm voice, "No! I am satisfied.&#xD;
This is no namby-pamby die-away rhyming - there is genuine&#xD;
stuff there ; that is true poetry, or I have it not in my nature to&#xD;
produce it. That cursed meddlesome woman has made me&#xD;
distrust myself for the moment ; by her extravagant praises- has&#xD;
made me doubt the genuineness of my own inspiration.' Her&#xD;
letter is so- evidently disjointed ranting, that it has shaken my&#xD;
self-reliance to have even read it. Curse her silly and imperti-&#xD;
nent legends, I shall read no more of them!"&#xD;
Poor Manton was, evidently troubled now, at length ; and can&#xD;
the reader conjecture why this last letter had so excited him?&#xD;
Had a subtle arrow found 'its mark ? , Was there any, thing in&#xD;
the poem really to justify the high-flown and ecstatic panegyrics&#xD;
of missive No. 3, in the snow-white envelope ?. You shall see-&#xD;
you shall judge.. Here is a frue copy of the poem: -&#xD;

&#xD;
OLD PLAY.&#xD;
Poop, Manton was not permitted to remain in peace at his&#xD;
labors long. On the' afternoon-'of the same day,'Doctor F.&#xD;
Willamot Weasel, scarcely taking time to announce himself by&#xD;
a sharp knook, bolted into the room, exclaim g-&#xD;
1Ah ! my 'dear friend, pardon me; bqt the lady concerning&#xD;
whom I spoke to you, is now in the parlor below, and requests&#xD;
the pleasure'of an interview."&#xD;

W4               SPRITUAL VAMPIRIS-M.&#xD;
A frown instantly darkened the brow of Marton, and he an-&#xD;
swered angrily-&#xD;
"Sir'you will remember tlhat I expressed to you, most dis-&#xD;
tinctly, a 'disinclination for'such an introduction. I told-you I&#xD;
did not wish to know this woman, then, and :I feel still less&#xD;
inclination -to.know her now."&#xD;
"But, a-ah ! mf dear sir, yqu would not surely be' unkind&#xD;
enough to refuse to .see tbe lady now, when she waits in the.&#xD;
parlor, in moinentary expectation of.,seeing you --for the ser-&#xD;
vantitold her you were in ?  It certainly can do you no harm to&#xD;
be courteous."&#xD;
" That's 'a.strong appeal to make to a Southerner, Doctor&#xD;
Weasel, it must be confessed."'&#xD;
"Yes,"- said he, rubbing his hands, "I thought you could&#xD;
not disregard it. I ain so anxious to' bring you together ! Do&#xD;
come.   I shall be "delighted.  Come! pray c+me! she is&#xD;
waiting.".&#xD;
"Doctor Weasel, I do this thing with great eluietance," said&#xD;
Manton, rising. "t suppose I must go; but rest assured, I do&#xD;
not feel particularly obliged to you for forcingmrent6 this posi-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
This was said in a very cold, measured tone ; but the Doctor's&#xD;
delight at the prospect of accomplishing his favorite and benevo-&#xD;
lent scheme, was so greate-sthat' his excitement prevented him&#xD;
from observing it.,&#xD;
"Nevernind, come along; you will thank me for it,' on the&#xD;
contrary, as lohg as you live.'&#xD;
- Manton left the room with him, and when they reached the&#xD;
parlor,she was rapidly introduced to Mrs. Orne ad.l her daugh-&#xD;
ter, who sat.upon a lounge awaiting him. The Doctor instantly&#xD;
darted.out of the roo'nm; and Manton was left'vis-a-vis with his&#xD;
ecstatic correspondent.         _&#xD;
As the woman. rose to meet:him,.the blood mounted to her .&#xD;
very plain face; _ind square, compact, masculine forehead  The&#xD;
child, Which was an ugly, impish-looking girl, 'with a mean fore-.'&#xD;

&#xD;
head, wide mouth and projecting .chin,.nevertheless arrested the&#xD;
eye of Manton, as he sat down, by a mournful expression of&#xD;
suffering in her 'light gray eye..&#xD;
The woman-was evidently:embarrassed for a moinent) by the&#xD;
studied coldness- of Manton's manner, whose eye continued to'&#xD;
dwell upon the. half-quaker, and' half-tawdry dress, rather than&#xD;
upon the face that Lhad at the first. glance -impressed him so&#xD;
disagreeably.'&#xD;
" I have found you out, at last !" said the lady visiter, in a&#xD;
low, pleasing voice. ":Nw   have ventured into the tiger's&#xD;
den, I hope he vildiotat me !"&#xD;
'You are perfectlysafe, imadan!" was the stiffresponse to&#xD;
this sally. "But toAwhat may I owe the hanor of this visit?&#xD;
Is there anything ean do for you ?"&#xD;
The blood mounted quickly to the woman's forehead as she&#xD;
answered hastily, "Yes, I wanted to know if you. can furnish&#xD;
me with -a copy of ally your works! I' have admired with 'so&#xD;
much intensity what I have, seen-but I am afraid you are very&#xD;
much of a naughty boy -you look so cold 'and cross! I am&#xD;
almost afraid to ask you !"&#xD;
"I am very sorry, madam, I have witten no works, as you&#xD;
are pleased to call them. What I have done is entirely frag-&#xD;
mentary, and I:have noi collected those fragments even for'  ny-&#xD;
self," was the-unbending reply.&#xD;
" Oh, yes, you have ! I have seen many of them, and you&#xD;
need not be ashamed to own them,.,for there is 'nothing of the&#xD;
kind in literature'to surpass them. Why, there 's -----," and&#xD;
she ran on with a ready list of what she termed works, not a&#xD;
little to the 'surprise Qf Manton, who only listened with a cold&#xD;
stare, and bowed profoundly, as she concdaed with a high-&#xD;
wrought panegyric.&#xD;
"I am sorry I have no such works in my possession, nor can&#xD;
I tell you' where they can be obtained!"&#xD;
The woman grew very red in the face .again, and bit her lips&#xD;
in vexation, while Manton remained silent. ,She soon rallied,&#xD;

however and commenced a conversation upon the -general lite"-&#xD;
rature 'of ,the day; i: which Manton, in spite of himself, was&#xD;
gradually interested, by a certain -sharp epigrammatic method&#xD;
of uttering heresies" and bold paradoxes; which seemed -to be&#xD;
peculiar to hermind, and which could not: but proie refreshing&#xD;
to one, who, like "Manton, most 'eartily detested commonplace.&#xD;
'He, however, did not unbead in the slightestgand the woman,&#xD;
who finally, in despair ofr" getting at hirm," rose to depart; said,&#xD;
yet persereringly, with-wining badinage&#xD;
"I1finiwyou in .a naughty humor-to-day. You are as cold as*&#xD;
an iceberg, and sharp as a nor'wester. When you get to be a&#xD;
good boy, you may come and'see me !"'&#xD;
"WhenIdos madam, I-shall surely corn'e !" was the response,&#xD;
accompanied by a very low bow; and delivered in a tone that&#xD;
would have frost-bitten the'ear of a polar bear.  f .&#xD;
The discoirfited 'woman hurried from the parlor with the'&#xD;
blood almost, bursting froi her face, while Manton, turning on&#xD;
his heel, mufteed -&#xD;
s"tWell! if' that does not freeze her of!; she ought to be&#xD;

from his office next morning, he found yet anothersnowy missive&#xD;
crowning the centre of his table.&#xD;
" Monsieur Tonson, come again !" he exclaimed, as he seized.&#xD;
the note, and opened it this time without hesitation," what can-&#xD;
the incredible woman have to say now? Well, here it is!".&#xD;
MY FRIEND --You heaped ice upon my heart      rdestray.&#xD;
To-day, I feel' chilled and stiffened, as if my very soul-wings&#xD;
had been frosted through your lips! Why did you do so? It.&#xD;
was not magnanimous in'you.  ou;are proud, and beautiful,&#xD;
and strong,';while I am plain, and weaktand lowly. Was-it&#xD;
worthy of a noble soul to treat with such harsh and cutting cold-&#xD;
ness a poor,'feeble, and wayworn.daughter of sorrow like my-&#xD;
self, who had come merely in the- meek and matronly overflow&#xD;
of tenderness and appreciation for a poisoned;sick and erring&#xD;
child of genius, to offer him her sympathy in his dreary and&#xD;
unrelieved immolation of glorious powers at the. unholy. altar of&#xD;
ambition? Was it not unkind of you? Can you suppose that&#xD;
had' you not been poisoned, body and 'soul, the' denon pride&#xD;
would have thus overruled your better and your angel nature to&#xD;
such harsh' rejection of the comforter, the Father had sent you&#xD;
in his mercy ? What have'I asked of, you, butthat you should&#xD;
unbend this fatal pride, and accept of mortal geialities? That&#xD;
you should spare yourself from yourself, and give something to&#xD;
others. Ah ! you will not always thus repulse the sympathies&#xD;
of your race -naughty, naughty boy! hasten to begood and&#xD;
core to see me!                              MARIE.&#xD;

to-see him in the parlor.m&#xD;

in Is conscience, that hhad brought down the judgment upon&#xD;

consequences of ls own imprudence, and went down to wait&#xD;
upon his caller; who, of course, was no other than- his cor-&#xD;
respondent..&#xD;
She'recewed him with a flushing face, as seemed, to be usual&#xD;
to her shrikin   nature.  She was this, time without her&#xD;
daughter. There were other persons in the parlor, and this&#xD;
seeded to disconcert-her somewhat, for she had evidently come&#xD;
1Fll of some "importnt;-disclosure. Although it was the latter&#xD;
part of winter, and a heavy snow had just commenced breaking&#xD;
: up, Which rendered-the streets of New York almost impassable,&#xD;
she neverthelessproposed that they. should go out for a iong&#xD;
alk. 'Manton looked through the window into the sloppy&#xD;
street, op eie4 his eyes a little, and assented.&#xD;
There was something wonderfully rare in the-idea of a wo-&#xD;
zjan 'sop(loposing a long walk on such aAday, and Manton&#xD;
 rekl.hed the hardiness anid originality'of the thing.  -&#xD;

After thi , what is' it 4hat Madame Wvon tdo ?  I'h lead her&#xD;
something of a round;.at -any iate, before she-gets back."&#xD;
These thoughts passed through'his 'mind as he ran. up-stairs&#xD;
for his cap. She met him as he came down, in the passage-way,&#xD;
and they passed out at the 'front door.h-&#xD;
,'aYou are a droll{person,'1 said Manton, ani they reached the&#xD;
street.&#xD;
" a Why?" asked she, with h covert learn in her eye.&#xD;
"'Why?; because few women would 'have thought of choos-&#xD;
big such a-day as this for-a walk.&#xD;
"I care nothing foItrifles! Misfortune has taught me to dis-&#xD;
regard tHein. Suffering makes us hardy."&#xD;
Manton looked  down at her with surprise.; for, of all things&#xD;
on earth, the most disagreeable' to him, was that commonplace&#xD;
timidity and shrinkig' from trifles, which is so ludicrousy cha-&#xD;
racteristic of American women. He did4 not wish to seewoman&#xD;
unsexed, but contemnied her puerile and unnecessary cowerdice&#xD;
His companion now proceeded with, great aniimation to follow&#xD;
up the favorable openingthus effected, with a rapid andpathetic&#xD;
sketch, in outline, of her sad and suffersg life..&#xD;
She had bieen married by hei parents to a. sordid lout of a&#xD;
Quaker, in- New England, whose horrid- barbarities and -perse-&#xD;

in her cause, who finally rescued' the child, by strategy or force,&#xD;
and restored' it. to its weeping mother's arms.&#xD;
"in addition to this sad tale of suffering connected with her&#xD;
private history, which was most skilfully and artistically worked&#xD;
up,'she,'had.another, of public martyrdom,-which'was, to Man-&#xD;
ton-, far more ipipressive.&#xD;
Through obscurity and poverty, this resolute- and daring wo-&#xD;
man ,haddedicated herself to 'the amelioration of.the physical&#xD;
evils of her he less sex.- She had, with unflagging ardor, stu-&#xD;
'died the -books of anatonuical science, the diseases 'of. her sex,&#xD;
and the wisest means of cure. And thus, in addition to having&#xD;
been the first woman in New England to publicly assert that&#xD;
there is no trae marriage but in love, she had also led the way&#xD;
in announcin-to women their sanitary duties to themselves;&#xD;
that they mistlearn to heal their bodies, and leave the other sex&#xD;
to .take care of their own diseases; that delicacy as well as&#xD;
utility promoted this course.&#xD;
This idea atl once met the approbation of Manton, to whom&#xD;
its assertion was comparatively novel but who had always.&#xD;
deeply felt the lamentable helplessness of 'woman, and the un-&#xD;
natural relation of the male members of the profession to them.&#xD;
The brave and hearty manner in which this singular woman&#xD;
had evidently breasted alone the popular prejudice, in a cause&#xD;
which he saw, at a glance, to -be so just and 'nobly utilita.&#xD;
rian, for the first time moved' his sympathies somewhat in her&#xD;
favor; in spite of his contempt and disgust for -women who ven-&#xD;
tared beyond their sphere.&#xD;
The vocation of a learned nurse to diseased persons .f her'&#xD;
own sex, was clearly to him not beyond the' proper sphere of&#xD;
woman, but a most important, legitimate, and-however little&#xD;
recognised,J conventionally - the' mosthonorable and useful.&#xD;
He' c  o    but respect theWoman, whatever her-eccentricitids&#xD;
mightbe,'who could be brave and true enough to assert effect-&#xD;
ively to her -sex the natural' and inevitable mandate," Know&#xD;
thyself!&#xD;
&#xD;
ETIHRJAL SOFTDOWN.                 11&#xD;
There was something chivalrous in the thought-,a generous&#xD;
daring, a martyr spirit, that could not fail to- arrest a nature in&#xD;
itself, rashly, scornful of all that was merely conventional, and&#xD;
whose untamed, half-savge soul rejoiced in all, novelties that&#xD;
expressed to him a higher utility than mere forms conveyed.&#xD;
The walk was continued for hours ; and still further to try her&#xD;
nerves, during this long conversation, Manton 'turned' through&#xD;
many intricacies into the most darkened labyrinths' of the vice-&#xD;
profaned metropolis.&#xD;
The woman never flinched ; nothing seemed' to appal her,&#xD;
and, as they threaded rapidly the dingy alleys of the -"Five&#xD;
Points," she had an acute theory or-'a daring speculation for&#xD;
each evil' the external form of which they successively en-&#xD;
countered.&#xD;
There was a 'vigor and. originality in all this, as coming from&#xD;
a woman, that interested Manton in spite: of himself. Plain,&#xD;
uncouth, and eccentric aswas this scorned "lecture-woman,"&#xD;
he could not but confess to himself, as they returned mud-be-&#xD;
draggled and tired enough from that long wal , that his respect&#xD;
for her had very much increased.&#xD;

Into this ever-gaping entrance she-wheeled, and darted up&#xD;
the broad, uncarpeted stairway, Which- she continued to ascend&#xD;
with almost incredible ease and swiftness, to'the fifth storf. When&#xD;
near the end of a long' and- narrow passage, she paused before&#xD;
one of-the doors, and tapping it slightly, entered without 'farther&#xD;
ceremony&#xD;
A handsome nd v-dressed woinan, who was engaged in&#xD;
writing -at a small escritoire looked up indifferently as she&#xD;
entered, but the moment ,she caught the expression of the new-&#xD;
comer's face, she sprang to her feet, thro'ving-doWn the pen,&#xD;
and with a strangely 'shrill and unmusical laugh,screamed out&#xD;
in'a most inconceivably voluble 'style-&#xD;
"Why, I' declare! Marie, what's the matter'?  Your eyes&#xD;
are almost bursting out of your head! You look as if you had&#xD;
found a bag of gold, and meant to give me half! Why, bless&#xD;
the woman, how she looks ! Have you .caught him at 'last ?&#xD;
Well, we're in luck! I've caught, my man for sure'! He's been&#xD;
here all the inorning,( he's just left!. Why, how the ,woman&#xD;
looks! She keeps staring so ! You haven't gone crazy for joy,&#xD;

at the condition of her dress. 4 Ia! ha! ha! ha! . o tell,&#xD;
what sort of a game have you been playing? Did you have 'to&#xD;
hunt him through a'pig-sty ?"&#xD;
The \woman had been standing motionless, in the meantime,&#xD;
with distended eyes and compressed mouth, stretched in a rigid&#xD;
smile of supernaturally savage exultation. She gazed towards'&#xD;
the face of the speaker, but did not seem to listen to, her, or see&#xD;
her features. She looked the .abstracted,, einbp6diment o.&#xD;

for ten weary years been unrelieved by any approximation to a&#xD;

always idealised woman!-he idealised everything. . He was a&#xD;

adored, he worshipped woman, as she lived in his memory-&#xD;
the holy attributes with which he invested her, penetrated and&#xD;
held him enchained in peaceful awe. He could not, he dare&#xD;
not. believe evil of her, if she bore the semblance of good, in&#xD;
thought, or deed, or life.&#xD;
He had shrunk thus long from contact with her, not because&#xD;
this interval of self-inflicted separation had been other than&#xD;
a weary penance of yearning, but'that his fastidious nature&#xD;
dreaded the .common contact, which might degrade or mar that&#xD;
ideal of love, which woman personated to him, and in the -wor-&#xD;
ship of which he had found the strength for brave deeds..&#xD;
It was the weakness, the petty flippancy, the commonplace-&#xD;
isms of woman, from which he shrank. He believed that .her&#xD;
spiritual strength should equalise her with man's physical strength&#xD;
in disregarding common fears, paltry conventionalities, and con-&#xD;
temptible topics. The miserable skeleton of soul and body,&#xD;
which the world calls "woman of society," was more horrible&#xD;
to him, by far, than the actual contact with her dry bones in a&#xD;
prepared skeleton would have been-for where one was a com-&#xD;
paratively pleasing object to his eye as a philosopher, the other&#xD;
was but the painted, dim-eyed, ghastly spectre of a living death.&#xD;
There was in this woman, at least so far as he could judge,&#xD;
a total abandon to her natural impulses, which seemed to utterly&#xD;
repudiate those restrictions which are merelycommonplace. This&#xD;
was refreshing to him, from its novelty, at any rate, in contrast&#xD;
with the insipidities he so much dreaded, although his taste had&#xD;
from the first been constantly offended.&#xD;

Yet she seemed'-so utterly lawless and quietly defiant of what&#xD;
the world, that works in harness, might say, he could not help&#xD;
krspecting her for it. It was a new thing in his life, to meet&#xD;
with a woman, sufficiently heroic, to face the martyrdom that&#xD;
she was daring, for so elevated and noble an aim as the emanci-&#xD;
pation of her own sex from the conditions of utter helplessness,&#xD;
into which their ignorance, of the laws of life had sunk them.&#xD;
Besides, she had shown so much earnest patience with his&#xD;
rude pride, had followed up its aberrations with such a matronly&#xD;
tenderness, exhorting him only, and unceasingly, to be at rest&#xD;
-a rest, the need of which his proud and fainting soul had con--&#xD;
fessed so often to his inward consciousness. And then this fihe&#xD;
appreciation - ah, where is the young poet who can withstand&#xD;
appreciation ? And then such delicate deference in, trifles.!'&#xD;
He had spoken incidentally of his taste in dress ; and now&#xD;
the mother and daughter were dressed in the most graceful and&#xD;
faultless simplicity! The heart of Manton was touched. He,&#xD;
felt grateful and pleased with these strange Samaritans to him&#xD;
m a strange land.    -&#xD;
On a slight pause in the conversation, the woman, still gazing&#xD;
up timidly into the face of Manton,.changed the theme sudden-&#xD;
ly, by asking him,&#xD;
" What do you think of Clairvoyance ?"&#xD;
" The world is not old enough yet, by twenty years, I think,&#xD;
to answer that, question."&#xD;
"TMy reason for asking the question, was, that I have some&#xD;
strange premonitions myself, which I cannot explain. You will,&#xD;
no doubt, .be able to explain the mystery at once --"Y&#xD;
Yes!" interrupted Doctor Weasel, eagerly, " do let us have&#xD;
you examine the matter! Facts have come within my own&#xD;
knowledge, concerning revelations which have been made by&#xD;
her, that, are the most extraordinary I ever knew. For instance,&#xD;
when she has been brought into' clairvoyant rapport with indi-&#xD;
viduals whom she has never seen er heard of before, she has&#xD;
revealed to therm the whole history of their lives."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
" This unexpected enunciation of their life-secrets to men,&#xD;
must of course be productive- of1strange scenes occasionally,"&#xD;
said Manton, in a tone which had.suddenly become cold.&#xD;
"Oh, very curious and interesting ! very curious !" exclaimed&#xD;
the Doctor, quickly. "Marie, do relate to him that incident&#xD;
of the bloody hand, that you have so often told me."&#xD;
"   ell," said she, "it has been some years since that a&#xD;
number of my friends, who knew of this giftof mine, were in&#xD;
the habit of inviting me to their respective houses, to meet&#xD;
friends of distinction, who were curious to observe the experi-&#xD;
ments, either upon themselves or upon others.&#xD;
" On one occasion I was invited to meet a celebrated physi-&#xD;
cian of this city; whose reputation for purity of character and&#xD;
life was very high. There were, no parties present but my&#xD;
friend, this physician, and myself. Such an arrangement, I&#xD;
afterwards understood, had been made at the particular request&#xD;
of the physician himself, who desired that there should be no&#xD;
other person present but his host at the interview.&#xD;
" When the physician placed his- hand upon my head, as is&#xD;
the necessary formula to bring me into spiritual communion&#xD;
with my interrogator, I relapsed almost immediately into the&#xD;
syncope of the clairvoyant' state, and of course became entirely&#xD;
unconscious of what Iuttered in that condition. But our host,&#xD;
who was his most intimate friend, has given me many times the&#xD;
following explanation of the scene :-&#xD;
" He says that when the physician placed his hand upon my&#xD;
head, I first said from the sleep, ' I am content ! All is pure&#xD;
here-this is a holy soul-one that is regenerate and will be&#xD;
saved!' and' then that while I was recounting his many deeds&#xD;
of kindness to the poor and friendless, and the' rich, I suddenly&#xD;
shrank back, exclaiming, 'Blood! blood! blood! There is-blood&#xD;
upon this hand!' This soul is darkened now'with blood ! Here&#xD;
is some fearful crime!. Murder has been committed by this&#xD;
hand ; everything seenis red beneath it!' My friend says -the&#xD;
doctor staggered back as if he had been shot, on hearing this,&#xD;

124               SPIRITUAL VAMPI1lISM.&#xD;
turned pale as death, and swooned -on the floor; and after' he&#xD;
recovered, acknowledged that he had committed murder and fled&#xD;
from th&amp;amp; consequences; the name by' which he was now known&#xD;
was an assumed one, and he implored his host not to expose&#xD;
him to the penalty. of the gallows by revealing these terrible&#xD;
facts.&#xD;
"My friend, of course, did everything he could to relieve,&#xD;
him' on that point, and assured him that he would never breathe&#xD;
the fact where it 'could injure him; that the purity of his life&#xD;
for so many years had cancelled the enormity of the crime, so&#xD;
far as society was concerned.&#xD;
"But in spite of all this, the wretched and guilty man left&#xD;
the house in overwhelming despair, and the last I have heard of&#xD;
him was that he had locked himself in .his own house, and was&#xD;
killing himself with the most unheard-of excesses in drinking&#xD;
brandy, to which vice he never before had been addicted.-&#xD;
"When I realised the tragic results of this fearful insight,&#xD;
with which I seem to have been mysteriously endowed, my very&#xD;
soul was shaken with sorrow ; and since that time my spirit has&#xD;
wrestled in agonies of prayer with God, that this poor child of&#xD;
crime and headlong vices might be 'saved!"'&#xD;
As the woman uttered these last words, Manton recognised,&#xD;
'for the first time, rand with a' shudder, a peculiar obliquity of&#xD;
the left eye. His soul was chilled within him; and for the mo-&#xD;
ment, the light of the glowing room was darkened as if the&#xD;
shadow of drear winter had passed over and through it.&#xD;
Doctor Weasel exclaimed gaily, "Is not that extraordinary?&#xD;
I assure you, I have myself witnessed things in connection with&#xD;
this power of hers, quite as inexplicable, though happily not so'&#xD;
tragic."&#xD;
"-It sounds strangely enough," said Manton,. shortly.&#xD;
"I assure you I have no means of accounting for these&#xD;
things,".said the woman in a meek, deprecatory tone.&#xD;
"Suppose you demonstrate. it, madam, in my case ;" and a&#xD;
slight' sneer, which crossed the face 'of Manton,' whose manner&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL $OFTDOWN.     -         12&#xD;
had :entirely changed, did not, escape the hawk-like quickness&#xD;
of the woman's eye. "My life, I am willing torsubmit to the&#xD;
scrutiny of your inscrutable sense."&#xD;
" Oh, by all means !" exclaimed Doctor Weasel, springing to&#xD;
his feet in a paroxysm -of delight. " Let us, have the experi-&#xD;
ment, by all means ! Do please place your hand on the top of&#xD;
her head!"&#xD;
Manton turned, and with a bow most studiously deferential,&#xD;
seemed to ask of the lady her permission to do-so.&#xD;
'' Oh, yes, yes," and her head was bowed forward to meet&#xD;
his upraised hand ; while the daughter, who seemed to under-&#xD;
stand the thing,'either from previous experience, or from some&#xD;
private signal, rose from her clinging position about 'his knee,&#xD;
and stepped back,.leaving the two-alone, without other contact.&#xD;
In a few moments after the hand of Manton had rested upon&#xD;
the meek, submissive head of the woman before him, she- com-&#xD;
menced exhibiting' the common and preliminary attitudes,&#xD;
muscular retchings of the throa, nervous twitchings of the lips&#xD;
and limbs, accompanied by thle apparently palpable, organic&#xD;
changes, which are recognised to be symptomatic with well-&#xD;
known conditions of the mesmeric sleep.&#xD;
Manton watched all these phenomena with the sharpest atten-&#xD;
tion, and then, as the lips began to -move as if in inarticulate&#xD;
enunciation, he leant forward over her, and asked -&#xD;
"What can you tell us of the soul, with which you are now&#xD;
in communication ?"&#xD;
After several preluding and spasmodic efforts to articulate&#xD;
sounds, the Clairvoyant at length said, in a voice only distinct&#xD;
above a whisper -&#xD;
"I see light! all light!-pure, holy light. It fills the universe&#xD;
with a mild radiance! I can see no blurs,'no -clouds in the fore-&#xD;
ground. I can see only angels, 'seraphs, and seraphim, and-all&#xD;
forms of light revolving in the sphere of this mighty soul !"&#xD;
" Is there no evil there ?'" said Manton.&#xD;
"No, I see none ; I see only white light.~&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8247-00000064"/>&#xD;
SPIRITUAL VAMPIRISM.&#xD;
&#xD;
"But look close --perhaps you might find somethingdark&#xD;
Look long and steadily into the world you visit-see if there&#xD;
be not clouds there."&#xD;
There was .a pause. The lips moved without articulation&#xD;
again ; and again Manton asked -" What do you see now ?"&#xD;
"I see, I see, the light is parting on either side ; out in the&#xD;
far distance, between those walls of light, a giant form uprears&#xD;
itself in shadow. - Down the long vista stands this darkened&#xD;
giant. He is fierce and stern, and wears a cold, hard front, with&#xD;
fla'ming eyes,. that scare the ministering angels all away. He&#xD;
strikes around him with the imperious sway of his huge, knotted&#xD;
club, and all, the bright forms flee. He seems the savage Her-&#xD;
cules of pride !'&#xD;
There is a pause ; and after a stillness of some moments,&#xD;
Manton asked again-&#xD;
"What now is the vision, to your sense ?-is the giant gone ?"&#xD;
"No, he is humbled but not subdued ; and from afar behind&#xD;
him, down this darkened vista, a light has grown up, like a-&#xD;
rising star. It advances slowly, rising over his head. The&#xD;
splendor increases as it comes. Now, thedark and wrathful&#xD;
giant has fallen on his knees--the-flood of glory overcomes&#xD;
him. His'club: is dropped. His eyes, upturned in awe, seem&#xD;
dimmed by the sadden glory of an angel's presence. Ha! I&#xD;
see ! the .features of that. angel are like his whose soul I see!&#xD;
The giant issubdued! His pride has bowed its forehead in the&#xD;
dust, before the angel, radiance of a visiting mother !"&#xD;
Manton felt his flesh creep as this was 'spoken, and as the&#xD;
Clairvoyant paused for some moments, he asked: "What does&#xD;
this spirit of the mother say ?"&#xD;
The slow answer-was --r&#xD;
"She seems to ,rebuke this pride even more with her efful-&#xD;
gence, and to say,-My son, I am -with thee in the spirit, but I&#xD;
cannot be with thee through the medium of the flesh which thou&#xD;
hast so poisoned .and corrupted, since I passed from thee into&#xD;
this higher sphere. Make thy body clean and purify thy life,&#xD;
&#xD;
and I shall be always with thee present, in the spirit. It is&#xD;
necessary for your usefulness in your present life that you should&#xD;
accept of human sympathies. It is only through such that you&#xD;
can .establish a true community with the material world of which&#xD;
you form a part. Accept human 'love- accept a moral repre-&#xD;
sentative of myself- believe in the possibility of its chasteness&#xD;
as well as utility, and you will yet be strong, powerful of good,&#xD;
and happy."&#xD;
Here Manton, who had become intensely excited during the&#xD;
progress of this scene, removed his hand with a vehement ges-&#xD;
ture from the head of the woman, and springing to his feet,&#xD;
seized his cap, and with scarce the ordinary adieus, hastily left&#xD;
the room. He rushed hurriedly through the dark storm, which&#xD;
careered along the street, muttering as he went:&#xD;
" Eternal curses on this infernal woman ! What can it mean ?&#xD;
She dares to speak of my mother again. Hah.! does n'ot this&#xD;
account for the inexplicable disturbance. of my papers in my&#xD;
trunk? Is it possible 'that this can be the accursed and despi-&#xD;
cable wretch who has stolen into the privacies of my life? But&#xD;
think, think! I may have been hasty. This whole subject of&#xD;
Clairvoyance-is an impenetrable mystery. That strange story&#xD;
of the bloody hand has impressed me. Foy all we know, as&#xD;
yet, suchthings may be within the possibilities of Clairvoyance.&#xD;
That myth she uttered as if she were in a dream, was strangely&#xD;
significant to me -"supposing her to be ignorant of all my past&#xD;
life ; and then she seemed so patient, so disinterested, so.gentle&#xD;
and so kind, so matronly, so tender, and so heroic, too. I can-&#xD;
not altogether distrust ier, nor can I believe ; I can only wait,&#xD;
I must see 'more ; I must know more ; I must comprehend&#xD;
the whole. There is a something here I cannot understand-a&#xD;
something betwixt heaven and hell, which I must bide my time&#xD;
to fathom. -Curses on all mysteries !" and, rushing onward&#xD;
through the storm, like one hag-ridden, or pursued by stern,&#xD;
accusing ghosts, the bewildered Manton soon reached his cheer-&#xD;
less room, all storm-drenched and depressed.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE PROUD      AN BOWED.&#xD;
Dim burns the once bright star of Avenel;&#xD;
There is an influence sorrowful and fearful,&#xD;
That dogs its downward course,&#xD;
SCOTT.,&#xD;
TRANSPARENT as is the meaning of the foregoing scene, it&#xD;
conveyed to' Manton, who knew none of these things which&#xD;
have been revealed to the reader, a tremendous shock. Mind&#xD;
and soul were thrown into chaotic convulsions; 'he knew not&#xD;
what to think, or which way to turn for truth.&#xD;
Had the incident occurred 'but a short time previous, before&#xD;
his nature had begun to be moved by generous sympathy and&#xD;
honest respect for this loyal, persecuted, and indomitable wo-&#xD;
man; 'had it occurred before that eventful walk through the&#xD;
slush of New York, he would have at once turned upon her in&#xD;
freezing ,wrath, with the deliberate accusation of having entered&#xD;
his room in his absence, and searched his private papers, or else&#xD;
have merely' sneered at it, as the accidental hit of a reckless&#xD;
adventuress..&#xD;
But he had admitted her to his respect as a' noble and unpro-&#xD;
tected devotee. In- a word,'he had, as was usual with him&#xD;
wherever women were concerned, idealised her into a heroine.&#xD;
qould he suspect her after this? He rejected the weakness of&#xD;
such suspicion almost with terror.&#xD;
Had he known any thing of New York'life ; had he formed&#xD;
any' relations except those of a strictly business character ; had&#xD;
he 'cultivated acquaintances at all, who belonged to the city, and&#xD;
knew it, a few inquiries might have settled all his doubts.. But,&#xD;
&#xD;
alas! pride,,pride, that fatal pride ! He knew nobody, he cared&#xD;
not for what any one said of another.&#xD;
He had heard this woman violently abused at the dinner-&#xD;
table below, to be sure ; but then the character of the persons&#xD;
who had joined in this cowardly vituperation was, to his mind,&#xD;
evidently such as to prejudice him in her favor; for he had a&#xD;
proud way with him, which never permitted him to judge of-the&#xD;
absent  by what was said of them, but-by who said it. Taking&#xD;
these things together, he would have felt ashamed to have asked&#xD;
any questions concerning the woman, of those whose opinion&#xD;
and opportunities of knowledge he respected.&#xD;
If she had thrown herself upon him, it had been with perfect&#xD;
frankness, and without any attempt at concealments. She had&#xD;
told him how she was persecuted and slandered by ignorant&#xD;
women, because she had been bold enough to tell them the truth&#xD;
about themselves. He had already heard something of this, and&#xD;
the stories told were of precisely such character as.envious, vul-&#xD;
gar, and malignant gossip circulates about females who make&#xD;
themselves conspicuous by their virtues or their ,talents. Be-&#xD;
sides, had he not, before he knew more of her, been violently&#xD;
prejudiced, too? What more natural than that others should be&#xD;
so, including these ignorant women ?&#xD;
And then this wonderful Clairvoyance ! Whocan dare to say&#xD;
that he believes nothing of its claims ? 'He held its marvels and&#xD;
miracles in great contempt, and firmly .believed, that whatever&#xD;
of truth there was would soon be unveiled of its apparent mys-&#xD;
tery by the close analysis of science, and shown to proceed from&#xD;
purely natural laws, the exact relations of which had not been&#xD;
heretofore understood.&#xD;
And then it might, have been accident. Ah ! and then, it&#xD;
might have been-what his thought had long struggled with as&#xD;
the solution of all such phenomena-it might have been sympa-&#xD;
thetic ! a mere result of the unconscious projection of his&#xD;
stronger vitality through a magnetic or odic medium of sympa-&#xD;
thy, which had been instantly established through the contact&#xD;

of his hand with the thin 'and sensitive region on the top of her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
She might thus have been made to feel him intellectually, if&#xD;
not spiritually ; to see, through this sympathetic sense, those&#xD;
images with  which his brain was most full, and thus express&#xD;
this startling outline of his life.&#xD;
Be those things as they may, he was restless and excited ; his&#xD;
imagination was aroused, his memory profoundly stirred. He&#xD;
was thus fast hurried past the point where a cool analysis could&#xD;
well avail to rescue him. - Tossed to and fro by doubts and&#xD;
dark suspicions, which a generous confidence 'strove hard to&#xD;
banish with. its magnanimous suggestions, backed by self-reliant&#xD;
pride ; confounded with the fear of acting with injustice towards&#xD;
a helpless female; with the fear, too, of the soft pluckings at his,&#xD;
heart, from those tender memories which she had thus aroused by&#xD;
her offers of maternal sympathy -together with the penetrating&#xD;
light and warmth of that genial and unlucky{ evening spent with&#xD;
her, amidst the quiet of domestic surroundings-he could form no&#xD;
conclusions, discriminate no clearly definite purpose -could&#xD;
only wander to and fro, restless, in troubled, sad irresolution.&#xD;
A vague dread of evil in advance afforded apprehension of&#xD;
he: knew not what, that always, when the gloaming darkened&#xD;
most, seemed' parted to a tremulous, dim light, like summer&#xD;
coming through the morn, and made his pulse go quicker, while&#xD;
those yearning memories faintly glimmered, as if within a shaded&#xD;
reflex of the glowing day.&#xD;
He kept himself strictly secluded ; yet, day by day, those&#xD;
dainty missives crept in upon -him by some mysterious agency.&#xD;
At first they were read mechanically, and, amidst his troubled&#xD;
doubts, produced no apparent effect; but, by an'd by, they grew,&#xD;
more chaste, more delicately' worded, and more sweetly toned.&#xD;
Was tit that they were really advanced upon the blundering&#xD;
specimens we have seen ? or could it be that his fancy had be-&#xD;
come excited with regard to them-that he was merely idealising&#xD;
unconsciously? or was it that those awkward first attempts at'&#xD;
&#xD;
producing imitations of the -rhapsodical style peculiar to himself,&#xD;
which had so excited his contempt, as obviously taken. from the&#xD;
study of his writings, had now been cunningly improved upon,&#xD;
since personal intercourse had afforded his correspondent a&#xD;
closer insight of his purer and more simple forms of expres-&#xD;
Sion?&#xD;
Had his haughty egotism been touched at last, by a skilful&#xD;
reflex of himself, thrown shrewdly into his eyes, from the daz-&#xD;
zling surface of this snowy crow-quilled page ?&#xD;
We shall see, perhaps. Here is the last that he received&#xD;
from her:&#xD;
" MY PooR FRiEND    My heart yearns over you; I am op-&#xD;
pressed with your suffering, for I feel how you suffer yet-how&#xD;
you are struggling, by day and by night, with those twin fiends&#xD;
of Doubt and Pride. I know my letters soothe you, though&#xD;
they cannot heal. . Had you not informed me so, in your note&#xD;
I should yet have been conscious of it. Had you never written&#xD;
to me again, I should yet have known that the great deep of&#xD;
your soul had been stirred at last, and that, though pride had&#xD;
triumphed in the struggle, love, genial, human love, had yet&#xD;
found, beneath the dark shadow of his wing, a warm resting-&#xD;
place once more beside thy heart.&#xD;
No human aid can save thee now-that stiff neck must be&#xD;
bowed-you must be humbled! Then will come the full influx&#xD;
of the light from heaven., Then you will iknow joy and peace&#xD;
again-the pure raptures of a holy rest will calm this dark, be-&#xD;
wildering struggle. I pray for you without ceasing-weary the&#xD;
throne with supplication that you may be humbled ! Your little&#xD;
sister sends you her tearful greetings-she weeps, for you with&#xD;
me always-for she dearly loves her tiger-brother. She says&#xD;
that, like all, terrible creatures, he is so .beautiful-oh, that he&#xD;
were only. good!                             MARIE."&#xD;
This letter strangely thrilled upon the already over-wrought&#xD;
sensibilities of Manton, whose nervous organisation had been&#xD;

rendered intensely susceptible by the protracted excitement&#xD;
under which he had been laboring. He read it over and over&#xD;
again, with increasing agitation, until it seemed, while his eyes&#xD;
suffused, as if the accusing angel of his own conscience spoke&#xD;
to him jn mild rebuke.&#xD;
Long he moaned and tossed-the, dim moisture struggling&#xD;
all the while to brim over thoseparched lids, that for years before&#xD;
had never known a freshening. Those tearless lids-how rigid&#xD;
they had been ! how bleak ! Like some oasis-fountain where&#xD;
the hot simoon had drank !-Dry_! dry !.&#xD;
Suddenly, with a deep groan, the young man bowed his head&#xD;
upon his hands, while the tears gushed between his fingers in a&#xD;
flood, that seemed the more violent from its long restraint. His&#xD;
body shook and rocked, while he gasped aloud-&#xD;
" It is true ! It is true!, This woman tells what is true !. This&#xD;
sullen pride has been the cause of all-I feel its crushing judg-&#xD;
ment on my shoulders now ! Great God! deliver us from this&#xD;
thraldom!' Let me but know my race once more ! let me but&#xD;
weep when others weep, and smile when others smile, and it&#xD;
will be to me for a sign that thou hast received the outcast into&#xD;
the family of thy love, once more ! Forgive,% oh, forgive me,&#xD;
that have so long held thy goodly gifts of earthly  consolation in&#xD;
despite! The.worm's presumptuous arrogance has but moved&#xD;
thy pity, oh, thou Infinite One! Forgive! forgive! oh,-let me&#xD;
feel that countenance reconciled once more! Give back to my&#xD;
weary soul the holy-communion of thy creatures! Pity! Pity!&#xD;
Pity ! Ah, there is a paradise somewhere on the earth, for the&#xD;
most wayworn of her darkened children-a rift in the sunless sky,&#xD;
,a glittering point above the darkened waters! Men are not all&#xD;
and totally accursed by their defiant passions. Pity sends star-&#xD;
beams through the port-holes of the dungeon. Mercy comes&#xD;
down on.holy light of visions, where stars cannot, get in. Oh,&#xD;
love,. Infinite Love! Thou art so -powerful of penetration-&#xD;

voiceless throes; when suddenly straightening himself, with a&#xD;

ETHEREAL SOFTDOWN.     .     128&#xD;
&#xD;
powerful effort, and while the -tears yet rained like an April&#xD;
shower, he drew towards him his paper, and wrote--&#xD;
WOMAN-I know not what to tall you-you~ have strangely&#xD;
moved me ! In my most desperate and sullen pride have I not&#xD;
struggled. long with this great blessing, which thou.hast brought&#xD;
me ! I would have driven the good "angel from me in wrath&#xD;
end scorn-but it would not be offended. In patience and long&#xD;
suffering it has abided-near, hovering-on white wings, until now,&#xD;
at last, the fountain has been troubled. Ah! woman, its depths&#xD;

one mighty crash,, the 'hideous ice-crusts that. had gathered,&#xD;
heaping-over it,'have burst away'before the flashing leap of un-&#xD;
chained waters. Once more my soul is' free--once more I&#xD;
smile back love for love into the sunlight, and-weep for joy--&#xD;
that God is good. Once more I feel as if the earth were a holy&#xD;
earth, and its flowers, too, might grow for me. Thou hast con-&#xD;
quered! . Thou hast conquered, woman ! Thy pure and chas-&#xD;
tened sympathies, thygentle and unwearied pleadings, thy meek&#xD;
compassion for the harsh and:wayward boy, have conquered.&#xD;
The stiff neck is bowed even now before God, and thee, his&#xD;
minister of good. Ah! forgive and pity me! My eyes are&#xD;
raining so, I can scarcely see to-write. 'I am shaken as in a.&#xD;
great tempest, body and soul. I could weep at your feet in&#xD;
penitence, and pray to be forgiven'and for pity! Ah,;that, I&#xD;
know you have ! I am blinded with these tears---I know not&#xD;
what I say ! -'Oh, be to me what I have lost.! I faint by the&#xD;
wayside ; my soul dies within me for that holy rest that I have&#xD;
lost--for the sweet, calm and tender peace, all the holy memories&#xD;
your loving gentleness has thus recalled: Ah, be to me all&#xD;
that you-have thus filled me with, anew! Receive me as your&#xD;
adopted child, that I may rest my throbbing head once more in&#xD;
peace and joy, upon a sacred bosom. Be to me, forever,&#xD;

CHAPTER       XV.-&#xD;
DELECTABLE GLIMPSES BEHIND THE' CURTAIN.&#xD;
Now, with a bitter smile, whose light did shine&#xD;
Lik,'a fiend's hope upon.her-lips and eyne.&#xD;
SHELLEY&#xD;
TURN we now to that large and mysterious house, to which&#xD;
we haye ,before -referred, near the corner of Broadway and&#xD;
Eighth Street. We will pass the greasy lintels, into the wide and,&#xD;
dirty entry, climb those five flights of stairs, turn down the long,.&#xD;
dark passage, and pause before a door, just one beyond that&#xD;
which we have had occasion to renrember in the course of this&#xD;
nartative.                  .-    "-&#xD;
We will take the liberty to'enter. The, scene presents the&#xD;
woman, Marie,-reclining, on a lounge, holding a note in her&#xD;
hand, which she seems to' have read and re-read with a peculiar&#xD;
look 'of' puzzled inquiry.&#xD;
The impish-looking daughter, to whom we have before re-&#xD;
ferred, was seated.in a chair, behind the'woman's head, and out&#xD;
of her sight., The creature seemed to have much ado to keep&#xD;
from laughing outright, for her face was screwed into all sorts&#xD;
of contortions in the effort to subdue, it, as she peeped over her&#xD;
'mother's shoulder, and watched her puzzled looks and be-&#xD;
wildered gestures.&#xD;
" Well!" said the mother, as if speaking to herself, "if one&#xD;
could only comprehend how he came to write this to me' -it&#xD;
seems to contain a great deal. Upon my word, it appears a&#xD;
beautiful snatch of rhyme, and to convey quite a confession -&#xD;
only I don't understand -it reads as if it were an answer to&#xD;
something that had gone{ before."  She reads.---&#xD;
&#xD;
Angels a subtler name may know,&#xD;
But not a subtler thought of joy&#xD;
Could thrilling through a seraph go,-&#xD;
Than that your presence brought to cloy&#xD;
And weigh my life down into calms&#xD;
With ai unutterable sense-&#xD;
Like music perfumed with the balm&#xD;
Of dews star-she -- all too intenseI&#xD;
" Most too high-strung, for my, purposes, it must be confessed!&#xD;
He never expresses any flesh and blood in his correspondence.&#xD;
Ah, well, I'll soon bring him out of that! But this really does&#xD;
puzzle me ! This is allthe note contains."  She turns the note&#xD;
to examine' it.  "It is certainly in his hand, yet he makes no&#xD;
explanation."&#xD;
Here the child, whose blood seemed ready to burst through&#xD;
her face in the' continued effort to restrain her laughter,,.tittered&#xD;
aloud. The mother sprang erect, and, turning upon her with&#xD;
an expression of rage and surprise upon her face --&#xD;
" What ! Why, what are you laughing about ?, ,What busi-&#xD;
ness is this of yours, pray ?"&#xD;
The child, although evidently a little frightened, had so ens&#xD;
tirely lost her self-control as to be unable to restrain the bursts&#xD;
of laughter which now followed each other, peal upon peal, as&#xD;
she danced about, the room in a perfect ecstacy of glee.&#xD;
The mother's face turned first pale and then .red, as she fol-&#xD;
lowed the motions of the child with her eye, until at last, with&#xD;
the expression of an infuriate tigress, she sprang to seize.her.&#xD;
The child was too quick for her, and with the agility of a mon-&#xD;
key, darted from beneath her grasp; and still shrieking with&#xD;
laughter, was pursued around the room -leaping the furniture&#xD;
with an airiness that defied pursuit -- which her strange, wild&#xD;
laugh yet taunted.&#xD;
The woman, after exhausting herself in vain' attempts at catch-&#xD;
ing her, sank upon the lounge-and at once, in a whining, fret-&#xD;
ful'voice, commenced to pour upon the head of the child, the&#xD;

186              SIITUAL VAMPIRISM.&#xD;
most inconceivable and galling epithets. So long as this tone.&#xD;
was held, the. child held out in defiant spirit, either of sulking&#xD;
obstinacy, or of -harsh and irritating laughter,, and tb every reit-&#xD;
erated question frpm the angry mother--" What are you laugh-&#xD;
ing at? What.do you mean ?"-"she only clapped her hands&#xD;
and danced more wildly to her elfin mirth.&#xD;
The mother now changed her tone of a sudden, in seeming&#xD;
hopelessness of carrying her point by storm. She began to sob&#xD;
violently, and turning with streaming eyes towards the child --&#xD;
"You -you tre-treat your poor mother very cruelly to-day;&#xD;
I am dying to know what it is you mean ; but you will not tell-&#xD;
me!. Please, dear, come and .tell poor mother why you laugh,&#xD;
vhat it is you mean, and what' you know about this letter ?-&#xD;
for I am sure you know something -- do tell poor mother, and&#xD;
she will'forgive you all!- Come, dear child!" and she reached&#xD;
out her hand as if to clasp her to her bosom.&#xD;
The child, who seemed to 'have no intellectual comprehension&#xD;
of the meaning- of all this, but to have taken a purely impish&#xD;
delight in watching the'confusion and puzzle of hermother, in&#xD;
regard to the letter at first, and then instantly, when she flew&#xD;
into a. rage, to' have answered in a monkeyish and -hysterical&#xD;
rage, on her own part ; now at once, with equal promptness, and&#xD;
with the common instinct of young animals, responded to the,&#xD;
tender infeetians of the maternal voice.&#xD;
Dropping her whole previous manner, she instantly sprang&#xD;
forward and ,knelt at her mother'sside. The mother did not&#xD;
speak for some moments, but silently caressed her, placing her&#xD;
hand frequently on her'head, the top of which she 'fondly stroked&#xD;
with a 'tenderness that seemed to linger there. She drew the&#xD;
child's face to hers too ; and although she seemed to kiss it fre-&#xD;
quently, it might have been observed that' she breathed deep&#xD;
and heavy exhalations upon different portions of it, which- she&#xD;
only touched 'with her lips.&#xD;
The effect was magical beyond any power of expression,.&#xD;
The hard, ugly, animal lines' of that child's face, which had&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL SOFTDOWT           1"t&#xD;
&#xD;
been writhed and curled but a few moments before, 'in every&#xD;
conceivable expression of most ignoble passions, at once sub-&#xD;
sided into the meek and suppliant confiding of that inexpli-&#xD;
cable and most tender of all the relations' known to the animal&#xD;
world, mother and child!&#xD;
" Dear, why did you not tell me what you knew about this&#xD;
letter before ?" said the mother, in a tone as musically reproach-&#xD;
fur as if she dallied with her suckling babe. The child buried&#xD;
her head in her 'mother's5bosom, and after ,a silence of some&#xD;
time, during which her mother industriously stroked the top of&#xD;
her head, she looked up, and in a sly, bashful tone exclaimed-&#xD;
"I did it just for fun,'to try how-writing love-letters went-&#xD;
I copied the verses from a book, in your han,, and sent 'them&#xD;
to him as yours !"&#xD;
Scarcely were these words uttered, than the languishing and&#xD;
tender-seeming mother hurled the child from her, backwards,&#xD;
upon the floor, with a violence that left her stunned and&#xD;
prostrate,"and springing to her feet, raged round and round the&#xD;
room, as only 'a feminine demon infuriate could be imagined to&#xD;
do, spurning now and then' with her foot, as she passed, the&#xD;
still senseless form of her own child!&#xD;
Hell might find an equal to this whole scene, but hell has&#xD;
always been too civil! It is enough ! This is jealousy! That&#xD;
woman is jealous of her own child ! and she only thirteen years&#xD;
old!&#xD;
How long she might have raged and raved, and to what con-&#xD;
sequences it might have led, heaven can only judge. Provi-&#xD;
dentially, perhaps, a knock at her door announced 'thie postman.&#xD;
She clutched the ,letter she received convulsively, and tearing it&#xD;
open, the instant he closed the door, read - what ? The letter&#xD;
of Manton, which we saw in the last chapter!&#xD;
She read it through,- standing where she had received.it-her&#xD;
eyes 'dilating, and her whole 'form changing. She literally&#xD;
screamed with joy as she finished the letter, and clapped her&#xD;
hands like one bewildered with a sudden triumph.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Ah,, ha! I have him! ,I have him!. He is mine hence-&#xD;
forth!: He cannot escape me now!" -and her oblique eyes fell&#xD;
upon the motionless child upon the floor.  " The little fool!-&#xD;
she catches my arts too soon-she is not hurt-but I must.help&#xD;
her."" She proved towards the child, but the demoniac triumph&#xD;
which possessed her-seemed irrepressible. ' She bounded sud-&#xD;
denly into the air, and almost shrieking aloud as she did soI-h-&#xD;
"I have conquered- I have conquered him at last !" came&#xD;
down' like a statuesque Apollyon transfixed in, exultation.. It&#xD;
was a horrible glimpse of unnatural triumph! It lasted but for&#xD;
a moment; for, with a sudden drooping of the usually stooped&#xD;
shoulders, as she turned towards the letter again, she said,&#xD;
thoughtfully,&#xD;
" This will not do-he perseveres even here in talking about&#xD;
mother ! mother ! and chaste ! and holy! 'and all that sort of&#xD;
thing.  The.,foolish boy is 'too much in earnest. I have used&#xD;
this stuff about long enough. -I must find the means of bring".&#xD;
ing him gradually around. Such a relation as the silly -fellow -&#xD;
desires wont -do between us-we are both too full of life! Oh,&#xD;
I'll write him a note at once that will' prepare the way - will&#xD;
break up the ice, as'he callsit, still more about his 'life !"&#xD;
She raised the-child, which had been stunned by the fall, and&#xD;
sprinkling some water upon her face, which caused the first long&#xD;
breathing of recovery, she laid her upon the lounge, muttering,&#xD;
as she did so, " The meddlesome little' fool! She' must do&#xD;
everything she sees me do! She must imagine herself in.love&#xD;
with everyone, whom slbe sees me pretend to-love.: She must&#xD;
'write love-letters when she sees.me write them, and heaven only&#xD;
knows what she wont do' next 'with her monkeyish imitation,!&#xD;
But I can't be crossed by a child so; if she is my own. Lie&#xD;
there until you get over the sulks -you are ,not much hurt !"&#xD;
She turned away from the child and seated herself at the&#xD;
table, exclaiming, as she seized her pen, "Ah! this letter! I&#xD;
'feel that 'I shall need all my skill and wit to word this properly,&#xD;
so as not to alarm him.. In his.present excited 'and hysterical&#xD;
&#xD;
mood, the veriest trifle would have the effect of-driving him off,&#xD;
at a tangent, forever beyond my reach. And yet it will not do&#xD;
to let things go on in this way; for I see that that idea of the&#xD;
motherly relation, if once' permitted to become settled in his&#xD;
mind now, will remain a fixed barrier, which I shall never be&#xD;
able to pass on earth. I must see him to-night, and take ad-&#xD;
vantage of his present over-wrought, ecstatic, and bewildered&#xD;
condition, to break down this boyish dream of his! Bah'! to&#xD;
think that he should have taken. me to be so much in earnest in all&#xD;
that first twattle about motherly- relations, which I found neces-&#xD;
sary to use in order to get at him at all!- Pity my correspond-&#xD;
ence hasn't warmed him up a, little by this time! I've tried&#xD;
hard enough, to be sure, but the queer fellow will persist in&#xD;
etherealising everything !"&#xD;
During this soliloquy, the child, who hadentirely recovered,&#xD;
lay. perfectly still, with sharpened attention, catching every&#xD;
word that was spoken. There was an eagerness in her eye&#xD;
which showed her to be, if not an aptscholar of such teachings,&#xD;
at least a very attentive one. The woman wrote&#xD;
"'Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name!&#xD;
thy kingdom come, thy. will be done on earth as it is in&#xD;
Heaven!' My soul is deeply moved for thee in this thy.time&#xD;
of trial. The good God chasteneth thee now-now is the hour&#xD;
of thy great tribulation come; now thy life-denons wrestle&#xD;
in thee, with the- love, the good the Father has sent to&#xD;
redeem  thee. ' Be strong! Ah, be strong even now, thou&#xD;
child of many sorrows, and thpu shalt yet find .grace and peace&#xD;
in acceptance with Him. Meanwhile I can but pray for thee&#xD;
and with thee. :I weary Heaven with supplications, that out of&#xD;
this travail a great and glorious soul may be born inthe humility&#xD;
of love, for light, eternal light.&#xD;
"Come to me this evening, that I may take that throbbing&#xD;
heart upon my bosom. I may soothe and calm youbut I cannot&#xD;
give you rest-rest comes only from the Father! .You psk me&#xD;

"Ah! ha! that will do it!" she said 'in a low chuckling tone,&#xD;
as she rapidly folded and.directed the letter ; " though he might&#xD;
take tbe alarm at .this if he were cool, yet there's' no danger&#xD;
now ! It will no doubt shock him a-little, but he has learned to&#xD;
believe in me, andin his ,present excited state he has deified rie&#xD;
aimostlint an object of worship; and any suspicion he might&#xD;
feel he would only blame himself for. Ah! this will do! it&#xD;
shall go instantly!: Here!" she said, turning sharply to the&#xD;
child, " Here! get up there, put on your bonnet; and take this&#xD;
letter! 'You 'know how to deliver it, and where! Come,-*up&#xD;
with you!"&#xD;
"But, mother," said the child, as she slowly lifted herself&#xD;
half-erect, " I don't feel like it-I'm'not well! You hurt nie !"&#xD;
Nonsense !",said the mother, harshly; "go take a bath, and&#xD;
do it quickly'too! . You'll feel well enough ! This letter must&#xD;
go, and shall go !- Get along, I say, and'do what I tell you!"&#xD;
The-child dragged herself slowly out of the room.&#xD;
"tThat little wretch will torment me to death !"&#xD;
The letter was despatched and reached its destination.&#xD;
Manton, whose 'excitement 'had -continued, without -'the&#xD;
slightest diminution, to return upon him, in paroxysm  after&#xD;
paroxysm, seized upon' this last letter with the famishing eager-.&#xD;
ness of a man:who looks for strength-for spiritual consoling.&#xD;
He read it with suffused and, swollen eyes; he scarcely saw&#xD;
what he read, so much -had his vision been dizzied, and obscured-,&#xD;
by weeping... But those last words did indeed shock and thrill&#xD;
him. He' was strangely startled; and, for a moment they seemed&#xD;
to open to him an appalling and terrific gulf of falsehood,;more&#xD;
hideous than yawning hell.&#xD;
We say, it was but for a moment ; but in that little space the&#xD;
blackness- of darkness overcame his soul. A shuddering of&#xD;
dread, of doubt, of fear, and all that horrid brood, the birth of&#xD;
&#xD;
ETEIAL SOFDOWN.                1:41&#xD;
rayless and unutterable gloom, passed over him convulsively, and&#xD;
then the whole was gone. He had been too intensely wrought&#xD;
upon by the ecstacies of Faith. He shook off, by.one great&#xD;
throe, the giant shadow of its natural enemy, this Doubt, which&#xD;
he now conceived had so long made his life accursed ; and the&#xD;
rebound, by a necessary law, carried him to a yet greater aid&#xD;
more unreasoning 'extreme of trust, and ..unquestioning confi-&#xD;
dence in this woman, as under God the instrument.and medium&#xD;
for restoring him once more to life and-the world.&#xD;
He at once determined to visit her, and prove to his own soul&#xD;
the falsehood of these dark suspicions of the being who had&#xD;
thus moved and spoken his inmost life for good.&#xD;
CHAPTER       XVI.&#xD;
REM OR SE.&#xD;
THE evening, was closing .in when Manton made his way&#xD;
through a heavy, drifting snow-storm, to the number of the new&#xD;
address, near the.corner of Broadway and Eighth Street, which&#xD;
had appeared upon the last notes of his correspondent. He was&#xD;
only made aware, thereby, that, she had- changed her residence&#xD;
from the rooms where he had visited her in Bond Street, and had&#xD;
thought no more about the matter ; for it would have somewhat&#xD;
damped his enthusiasm, or rather have made him furiously-in-&#xD;
dignant, to have been told that the woman he was visiting;, with&#xD;
such sublimated sentiment, usually found means to adapt her&#xD;
rooms to the purpose and business in hand.&#xD;
He was too much excited and pre-occupied to notice the sig.,&#xD;
nificant appearance of the entry, further .than to feel its dreari-&#xD;
ness, as he rang the bell and waited an unreasonable time for&#xD;
admission. 'The door was wide enough open to be sure, but he&#xD;
was not sufficiently initiated-into the mystery of such places to&#xD;

understand the meaning of this exactly, even if it had been&#xD;
possible.fr it to.have'excitd his attention, in the then absorbed.&#xD;
s  ndfabstracted condition'of his 'whole faculties.&#xD;
Aero ervant at length made his appearance, and approach-&#xD;

nidetf that uider othei'circumstances he would surely have&#xD;

te, oly passed on: up the stairs with a feeling of annoyance, the&#xD;
cause of which he made no attempt. at apprehending. He as-&#xD;
i.rended three steps at a bound; and in a moment tapped ,. htly&#xD;
at te~door.       -&#xD;
A .oft voice;" "ome !" was the response. The door flew&#xD;
open.r.                                                .&#xD;
Yes:! yes!. I come! A, Marie, mother, it must be so !"&#xD;
And 'dropping his cloak and' hat upon the floor, he sprang for-&#xD;
ward to.the woman, who, with her pale face beaming with un-&#xD;
-natural light, was seated upon a lounge, where she seemed to&#xD;
have been awaiting'him.&#xD;
"My podr friend!" and she stretched forth her arms towards&#xD;
him. Ie laid his head'upon her bosom, while his whole frame&#xD;
shivered'violently, and he sobbed forth.-.-&#xD;
aAh, blessed mother, let me rest here! !My brain is bursting !&#xD;

lightly with her. fingers.  'Only be. calm, and God will give&#xD;
you strength 'to pass through this valley and shadow of trial."&#xD;
"Gode"gave me 'strength!" said he, with a sharp ar1d sudden&#xD;

"Woman, he gave me strength when he gave me life ! I have&#xD;

world buffeted and baffled rue, to renew upon her bosom my&#xD;
faith in my fellows, and it was upon that sacred restingplace&#xD;
that. I alone found soothing. She reconciled me to endure.&#xD;

life; and when she passed from me and the-world, I first real-&#xD;
ised what darkness, death, and separation meant.&#xD;
I was delirious I know not how long--for they seemed slowly&#xD;
tearing my heart out by the roots, chord by chord, with a heavy&#xD;
drag, until thelast one snapped, and then I went into deep&#xD;
oblivion, from which I awoke a man of stone,' so far as sensa-&#xD;
tion went ; and if stone couldwalk, with no more heart than it--.&#xD;
or rather if you can imagine this walking statue moulded of the&#xD;
red lava, and only cooled upon the surface, you can better con-&#xD;
ceive the smouldering, heart-devouring chaos in which my life&#xD;
now moved  among my fellow. I did not stop to curse and&#xD;
battle'°with mold foes, I only hated them with'a liquid flame&#xD;
ofscorn thatffound its- level in me and was still. I would not&#xD;
harm them--no, not I-I wanted them to live for companion-&#xD;
ship in suffering. I gloried in their perversions--they filled me&#xD;
with ecstasy. I could not but add to them,.and in ferocious&#xD;
delight threw myself into all-the excesses and extremes that de-&#xD;
monise the world."&#xD;
"But ambition .came to rescue my dignity at last, and of its&#xD;
iron despotism you have seen the worst. From' its hard and&#xD;
meagre thraldom you have released me for the time, but it re-&#xD;
mains with you to hold me, free, The wings that have borne&#xD;

you that I look for their realisation, and yet you have not ac-&#xD;
cepted that pure and holy relation conveyed in the ' Marie,&#xD;
mother,' I have named you, and plead with you to recognise."&#xD;
During all-this.time the-face of the woman had been, bowed&#xD;
so close to that of Manton that she seemed almost to touch with&#xD;
&#xD;
ETEERIAL 8OPTDOWN.&#xD;
&#xD;
her lips, first-his temples and then his cheek. A close observer&#xD;
would have perceived, in her long ard deep inspirations, her&#xD;
slightly~parted lips and the slow creeping movement of the head,&#xD;
that she was steadily- breathing upon certain well-known 'and&#xD;
highly -sensitive nerves. The brain of Manton was. too full to&#xD;
'notice this. strange manoeuvre; but while he -talked, that hot&#xD;
breath had been sending soft thrillings through his frame which,&#xD;
at first unobserved, had' gradually grown more palpably'deli-&#xD;
cious, until, as  he ceased to 'speak, he found his whole'frame&#xD;
literally quivering with passion.&#xD;
He was -silent for a moment, that he might fully realise the&#xD;
sensation, and then, with a shudder of horror, sprang away&#xD;
from contact with the woman, exclaimiing--&#xD;
" My God ! what is 'this'? What an unnatural monster am&#xD;
I! or"-as a sudden gleam of suspicion shot through his brain&#xD;
-" Woman, is it'you who have done this?" His face darkened&#xD;
in an expression of rage and ferocity which was absolutely&#xD;
hideous, as his eye glanced coldly on her.&#xD;
"I' ask you, woman, was it some inferna} art, of yours.?&#xD;
Answer me!-for, by the Eternal God, you shall never thus-&#xD;
tamper with the,"sacrednesses of a true man's heart again !"&#xD;
and, grinding his teeth, he approached her menacingly, as if, in&#xD;
his blind rage, he would rend her to atoms.&#xD;
The woman had taken but one glimpse of the terrible face&#xD;
before her, and then shrunk bowed and crouching into the&#xD;
corner of the lounge. Her neck and forehead flushed crimson,&#xD;
spasmodic retchings of the throat commenced, and whet Manton&#xD;
stretched forth his hands, as if to. clutch her, there was a deep&#xD;
suffocating cough, and the red, warm blood gushed in an ap-&#xD;
palling current from her mouth, bedabbling his fingers and her&#xD;
clothing.&#xD;
The man was startled from his rage into immeasurable terror,&#xD;
as he shrank back with upraised hands-'&#xD;
"My 'God! I have killed-I have killed her by my brutal&#xD;
violence! .I am accursed ! I .am accursed for ever!' I have.&#xD;

slain the white dove of peace-they sent to me from Heaven-!"&#xD;
Snatchinga towel, he was on his knees by her side in an in-&#xD;
. sant;. and  'lacing it within her bloody hands, which were&#xD;
clutched upon her mouth, as if to stay the fatal tide, he burst&#xD;
into an agony of tears, praying in frantic accents to be forgiven;&#xD;
for he could see nothing but immediate death :in a hemorrhage&#xD;
so violent, as this  seemed, and he-. remembered now, but too&#xD;
vividly, hgw ofteR she had told him of her. melancholy predis-&#xD;
position to such: attacks from. the;lung, -by.which she was kept&#xD;
constantly- in expectation of being carried offE&#xD;
Ah, with what fierce remorse, what agonised penitence, all&#xD;
these things came up to him now, as. gush after. gush of crimson&#xD;
saturated thetowel In answer to -his 'prayers for forgiveness,&#xD;
she at last reached. one cold, bloody hand to- his, pressing it&#xD;
gently.  -r  -y-,:&#xD;
And now his self-possession was immediately restored. His&#xD;
only thought, at first, had. been forgiveness before she died;&#xD;
now he thought alone how to save her. Strange,:he did not once.&#xD;
thinkHof giving the alarm, and sending for medical aid ; for he&#xD;
instantly felt the case was one beyond-"the reach of ordinary.&#xD;
remedies, and ne in which the most perfect restoration of both&#xD;
the moral and physical natures to abablute repose could alone&#xD;
avail. .         -    -&#xD;
He -eached another towel frpm the toilet-table, on which he&#xD;
found, by the way, abundant supply, which, innocently enough,&#xD;
seemed'4to. hii remarkably apropos; then,- seating himself by&#xD;
her side, he endeavored, 'by the use of all tender epithets which&#xD;
could be applied, to soothe and-calm her. .She suddenly seized-&#xD;
his right hand and placed it upon the top of her head, and from&#xD;
that moment he thought he .could 'faintly perceive an increase&#xD;
of his cqiitrol over the more violent symptoms of the case. -&#xD;
More than half an hour of harrowing suspense had passed,&#xD;
before the paroxysm of bleeding had so far subsided as to enable&#xD;
himto. breathe more freely; but even when the bleeding had at&#xD;
length entirely ceased, a long period of coma, or death-like sleep,&#xD;

induced by' exhaustion, and suspended sensation, supervened,&#xD;
during which he continued -to watch her with the most painful&#xD;
anxiety, still holding his right hand upon her head, while, with&#xD;
the other, he clasped the fingers of her left hand as she had&#xD;
requested. As she immediately showed signs of restlessness on&#xD;
his attempting to remove either hand, he felt himself-compeled&#xD;
to sit thus, without change of position, for several hours, awaiting&#xD;
whatever might occur.&#xD;
And, finally, after a slight stirring of the limbs, she suddenly&#xD;
opened her eyes upon his, and smiled with a clear, sweet smile,&#xD;
rather of pity and, affeetionthan of forgiveness or reproach. He&#xD;
felt his heart bound, within him, and he -could oily utter, in a&#xD;
low tone, "The good God be blessed.! I have not killed you!&#xD;
Oh, I will never be ugly and cruel again! I will be your good&#xD;
boy now, always!"&#xD;
"Yes, yes," she said in a clear,,firm voice, ' you were very&#xD;
naughty; but -I ai strong again now. You will never speak&#xD;
harshly to me-again, will you? Lean here, my beautiful tiger ;&#xD;
let me feel that fierce cheek upon my bosom once more. You&#xD;
have suffered, too; I must soothe you."&#xD;
Manton, who,h'by this time, had become thoroughly exhausted,&#xD;
bowed his head lightly towards her, in obedience; but he leaned&#xD;
it rather upon the cushion than her person.&#xD;
It was now near twelve o'clock, and the man was lite-&#xD;
rally worn -out by the lng and violent- excitements which we&#xD;
have traced. Body, soul, and sense, utterly collapsed, the mo-&#xD;
ment his head found a resting-place, into-a deep sleep.&#xD;
The lamp burnt low; there was not another sound to disturb&#xD;
the dimmed silence of that room, but the heavy breathings of&#xD;
Manton. But even that murky light was, sufficient to disclose&#xD;
the figure of the woman stooping, as before, close to- the face&#xD;
of the- sleeper. Slowly her lips crept over, without touching&#xD;
it, lingering here and there, while her chest heaved with deep'&#xD;
inspirations. You could not see, had -you been a looker-on,&#xD;

CHAPTER      XVII.&#xD;
IT would be' well for sinners were there no to-morrow. At&#xD;
least it would be well for them so far as impunity in the enjoy-&#xD;
ment of sin was concerned., But it may not be ; the inevitable&#xD;
time of reaction must follow that of excess, the wages of which&#xD;
are remorse.&#xD;
The effect of that to-morrow upon' poor Manton was fearfully&#xD;
crushing. At 'first he dared not think -the horrid realisation&#xD;
would have slain him. -He dared not look up, lest he should&#xD;
see the great height from which he had fallen. He ,dared not&#xD;
hear the voices within him, or above him, lest they should blast&#xD;
his sense. He shrank from the sunlight, as though each ray&#xD;
were a fiery arrow, to cleave hissing through his brain. - He&#xD;
dared not look his fellow-man in the face, lest he should see the&#xD;
mark upon his brow, call him accursed, and spit upon him.&#xD;
The innocent eye of childhood was the most dreaded basilisk&#xD;
to him; and the face of a pure woman nade him shrink and&#xD;
shudder in 'aifrighted awe.  His shadow seemed a speciral&#xD;
mockery to him, for it no longer glided with him, straight and&#xD;
firm, but was bowed, and crept sneaking after.'&#xD;
The burden of a hundred years had fallen upon the young&#xD;
man's shoulders in one fatal night-a ghastly, loathsome burthen&#xD;
of self-contempt -his face had grown old; his eyes lost their&#xD;
proud fire ; his lips, their firm expression ; there was no longer&#xD;
any " aspiration in his heel."  The haughty, bounding self-&#xD;
reliance, the unflinching, upward look, were gone! gone ! Man-&#xD;
ton had lost his self-respect.&#xD;
Ah, fearful,:fearful loss, that it js! . There was a leaden des-&#xD;
peration in the man's whole air that was shocking, even to those&#xD;
who had never seen him before.. There was no bravado in it-&#xD;

it was sultry, slow and self-consuming -shrank from observa-&#xD;
tion,' and burned -inward.&#xD;
.He neither sought Dor found any palliation for himself. He&#xD;
blamed no one else; his'pride  would not permit him to confess&#xD;
to himself that he had been unduly.influenced, or that any un-_&#xD;
fair advantage had or could have been taken of him. No, it&#xD;
was-his own fall._ His own grossness had profaned those asso-&#xD;
ciations which he had stupidly deluded himself, for years, into&#xD;
-supposingto be really sacred things in his life. He had ren-&#xD;
dered himself,'thereby, unfit for Heaven, unworthy Earth, too&#xD;
base for even Hell.&#xD;
His first sullen =recourse was -to the winescup, that he)might&#xD;
numb the unendurable agonies. He drank to monstrous excess;&#xD;
but, no, it would not do; that cold burning,.as of, an ice-bolt&#xD;
t'Gough his heart and brain, lay there still,-in the two -centres.&#xD;
He sought and found' men- like himself, with great thoughts&#xD;
and stricken hearts; like -himself, brain-workers; and in the&#xD;
fiercest orgies. of .desperation, hours= and hours were spent with-&#xD;
out attaining to, one moment of the-coveted'oblivion.&#xD;
The evening had long set in among such scenes, when a note&#xD;
was suddenly thrust into his-hand from behind, and as he turned&#xD;
his head, he saw a boy hastily making his Way, through the&#xD;
thronged room. This movement had not been observed by,&#xD;
his noisy companions --;heihastily concealed the rcote.&#xD;
He had recognised the superscription with a feeling of deathly,&#xD;
sickness, for which he cduld not clearly account. It 'was as if&#xD;
the fresh wdunds-were all to betorn open again.&#xD;
He soon after found an opportunity to withdraw beyond&#xD;
observation, and opened the: note, which, contained only these&#xD;
words: Z..     -&#xD;
My FRIEND :-why have you left me all day? come to me-I&#xD;
am-dying.t:-                                 MARIE.&#xD;
The sheet was' bespattered with blood.  Manton nearly&#xD;
fainted. 'Recovering himself in a moment, he muttered, "In-&#xD;
&#xD;
fernal brute that I am! to have neglected the poor, frail creature&#xD;
thu--after last night, too ! May God forgive me, for I shall&#xD;
never forgive myself!"  He hurried from, the room.&#xD;
The scene, on 'reaching her apartment, was, as may by this&#xD;
time "be expected, ghastly enough. But as -we have seen a&#xD;
little more of these horrid bleeding scenes than Manton has, we&#xD;
will refrain from, another description of one, since we have&#xD;
found that they3only differed in the intensity of effect and de-&#xD;
gree in the precise ratio of -the results to be, attained. In' this&#xD;
instance she had not reckoned without her host.&#xD;
Manton, who never dreamed of suspecting her, and had been&#xD;
fully impressed with the belief that these attacks were fearfully&#xD;
dangerous, and that the magnetism- of his-.touch, whether ima-&#xD;
ginary or otherwise- could alone suffice to' restore her to the&#xD;
calmness necessary for -the arrest of the hemorrhage, felt as if an&#xD;
awful responsibility had been suddenly -devolved upon him; as&#xD;
he thus apparently held 'the -very life of this singular woman in&#xD;
his own hands.:&#xD;
This inmpression had been consummately-fixed upon the mind&#xD;
of Manton by her obstinate refusal to permit the-presence, at their&#xD;
interviews, of'any third person, not -even that of her own child.&#xD;
She could .thus, through his generous humanity, most eflectually&#xD;
draw him toher side; -and, when once in her, reach, he was&#xD;
again in the power of those fearful arts, of which we have - seen&#xD;
something.&#xD;
The life of Manton became'now a succession of the:"to-&#xD;
morrows" of remorse: Each new sun arose upon its succeed-&#xD;
ing scene of wilful, self-degrading excess, such as, we have wit-&#xD;
nessed. He never permitted himself to grow afully- sober, but&#xD;
drank incessantly --morning,:noon and night.' But that the&#xD;
wines he chose were comparatively light, and lees rapidly fatal&#xD;
than the-heavier and more dangerous drinks of our country, he&#xD;
must have,'undoubtedly, destroyed his life, as he did his busi-&#xD;

He still wrote brilliantly-nay, even with a fierce and poetic&#xD;
dazzle of style that surprised men greatly, and added rouch to&#xD;
the notoriety,if not to the solidity of his reputation. But every-&#xD;
thing went wrong with him. His purse was regularly drained&#xD;
by a remorseless hand; his wardrobe fell into neglect, and the&#xD;
marks of excess upon his fine, proud features, were at once&#xD;
rendered conspicuous by their association with almost seedy ha-&#xD;
biliments.&#xD;
Before one year had passed he had begun to exhibit himself&#xD;
before: men, in the pitiable light of one who had more pride left&#xD;
than self-respect. In a word, he had fallen fully into the toils&#xD;
of the hellish Jezabel.&#xD;
Remember, in judging of poor Manton, that while he-is hood-&#xD;
winked, through mtich that is most noble in him, we .see this&#xD;
woman through the strong light of day. He looks upon her as&#xD;
a devotee of science, in the holy cause of human progress and&#xD;
social amelioration.. A poetand enthusiast, his life' is dedicate to&#xD;
both. He regards her as a frail being, whose life hangs by a&#xD;
thread, and that thread -held in his own hand -= degraded into&#xD;
a false relation- to himself-a relation which he, loathes, to be&#xD;
sure, and which he feels to he heavily and'swiftly dragging him&#xD;
downward, every instant, while it lasts,, but' which he dare not&#xD;
utterly break, for/the fearthat that frail thread of life, of which&#xD;
he has s, strangely become the' holder, should be snapped. He&#xD;
has only seen her, through her representations of herself; and&#xD;
therefore,, all that is chivalrous and tender in him -has been&#xD;
aroused in her defence, as the white roe, hunted into his strong&#xD;
protection for ;defence against the demon hounds' of New Eng-&#xD;
land' bigotry, jealousy, 'and fear.  Apart. from all other con-&#xD;
siderations,.these were sufficient to compel an utter negation of&#xD;
self, in .all that .related to her, as well as a hasty dismissal of&#xD;
those 'suspicions that might thrustthemselves upon him.&#xD;
A house, in the meantime, had been taken for her in Tenth&#xD;
Street, for the rent of which. Manton,-and the benevolent Doctor&#xD;
Weaselwere to become jointly responsible. But the woman&#xD;
&#xD;
'ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN.      '         158&#xD;
was far too astute to permit any such entanglements as might&#xD;
lead, prospectively, to mutual explanations between her victims.&#xD;
The Doctor alone ultimately became her endorser for the rent.&#xD;
She had other designs upon the less plethoric purse of Manton.&#xD;
In entering upon this 'arrangement, Manton had been induced&#xD;
to believe, by'her own representations, that for ten years before&#xD;
the name of Preissnitz had been heard of on thi' continent, this&#xD;
woman had been practising wa'ter-cure among her women pa-&#xD;
tients. Manton had been sufficiently educated in the profession,&#xD;
to understand that.its general pretensions were essentially empi-&#xD;
rical.= He was too much an Indian,.,indeed,' and'had lived'too&#xD;
much among Indians, to regard anything beyond the simplest&#xD;
natural agents as efficiently curative. 'He therefore recognized&#xD;
what Preissnitz had discovered, as simply confirmatory of his&#xD;
experience of the usages of savage life, and his own observation&#xD;
so- far as it went. It contained not to him ,any Pre than any&#xD;
other pathy, the essential vis medicatrix of nature'; but it seemed&#xD;
good to him, because it was new to the popular sense, and wash&#xD;
well worthy to be urged upon its recognition, and thus 'to find&#xD;
its proper place among the other systems.&#xD;
He entered upon the project with the fullest enthusiasm, for&#xD;
this woman seemed to him, from her personal habits and untir-&#xD;
ing energy, to be specially set apart to preach the crusade of&#xD;
physical cleanliness to her sex. "The house was therefore occu-&#xD;
pied by her as proprietress and female physician, while Manton,&#xD;
Doctor Weasel, the fiery Jeannette, and victimised Edmond, of.&#xD;
a former scene, occupied respective chambers 'as boarders, and&#xD;
patrons of the new enterprise.'  '&#xD;

BUT even in the black'abysses of the hell down which he had&#xD;
fallen, a flowercould grow to the eye of Manton. It was the&#xD;
strange birth of a wizard evil place ; yet, as it spread beneath&#xD;
his nourishing eye and hand, it daily grew more beautiful to him.&#xD;
It may havebeen the unconscious contrast of a something young,&#xD;
living, and blooming in an unnatural sphere like this, where he,&#xD;
with the sudden weight of centuries upon him, breathed with,&#xD;
such heavy gasping. He could not tell what it was that thick-&#xD;
ened this drear air; he only felt the oppression on his lungs,&#xD;
and shuddered when sleep had partly sobered him, and he could&#xD;
realise it for the hour. His sympathies had been first touched&#xD;
for that ugly, impish, persecuted child, to which we have fre-&#xD;
quently referred, because he, saw, at once, that the mother's&#xD;
querulous jealousy was forever subjecting it to a species of covert&#xD;
torture, which kept it always haggard and wretched. Had it&#xD;
been. a sick and neglected kitten, on the hearth, he would have&#xD;
felt for it the'same kind ofisympathy. He accordingly noticed&#xD;
and caressed the child, and endeavoured to rouse its low, igno-&#xD;
ble frontal region into activity. . The response of a hungry and&#xD;
vivid animalityy, surprised him with its aptitude of apparent in-&#xD;
telligence. -He did not understand that marvellousfaculty of&#xD;
imitation which, in all the animal tribes approximating man, or&#xD;
which, in other words,' are born with embryo souls, assumes the&#xD;

he had yet to learn, to his heavy cost, how a perception and de-&#xD;
tection of the physical harmonies of sound may be utterly distinct&#xD;
from the spiritual comprehension of their meaning. .He had yet to&#xD;
fearfully realise how this insensate aptitude of harmony, which&#xD;
enables the monkey of the organ-grinder,-to dance in perfect&#xD;
time the most wild and rapid strathspey that ever Highland pi=&#xD;
broch rung, or a stupid parrot to whistle the divinest strains of&#xD;
Mozart; could yet bestow upon the combined parrot and monkey&#xD;
of our own race that segnblant mockery of the "gift of tongues,"&#xD;
the use of the'soul's higher language. In a word, he would&#xD;
have been greatly shocked to hear the affiliated Poll and Jocko&#xD;
talk down Shelley in his own etherealisms, and appal Byron with&#xD;
the mad bravado of forgotten linys from his own reckless and,&#xD;
besotted misanthropy.&#xD;
Poll and Jocko are easy enough to detect through all the hu-&#xD;
man disguises'of their combined powers, if the man of common&#xD;
sense and society meets the itnpersonation for the first time,&#xD;
when developed, or in most of the latter stages of development.&#xD;
But it was a very different thing with poor Manton, who only&#xD;
saw an undeveloped, abject animal, from which he expected&#xD;
little but the gratitude of the brute for protection, and from which&#xD;
anything like a vivid response was as surprising as it was un-&#xD;
consciously gratifying to his egotism, for the reason that all. that&#xD;
was really pleasurable in it was owing to the fact of its consti-&#xD;
tuting a close reflection of'his own mind.&#xD;
Gradually the feeling took possession of him, a he observed&#xD;
in her an excessive sensibility, that could weep _it a moment's&#xD;
warning, and laugh like April through the glistening storm in&#xD;
the next instant,cthat he would make amends for the great sin&#xD;
of his life, in working upon this sensitive organisation for good..&#xD;

guarded-it with holy zeali his prayers might-rise upon the first&#xD;
odora That went, up from this strange young flower to Heaven,&#xD;
and bring its light down too, in forgiveness,'to him.&#xD;
He did not know--for he'had fed.on poisons until it had be-&#xD;
come a 'kindof second nature to him; asto that old'Pontiac king&#xD;
-that the pure light of spheres could never reach him through this&#xD;
lurid glare, which he had now come to think the natural day -&#xD;
that the odor of no flower could rise through its thickened air&#xD;

knowingwhy, he threw himself between the child and the bale-&#xD;
ful shadow of its" mother. He spread his hands above her in&#xD;
blessing ; he watched' that he niight shield her:&#xD;
From the moment when his attention had been- first attracted&#xD;
to her, she seemed to become illumiated; her ungainly body&#xD;
appeared assuring the lines of beauty ; her mean,.harsh features,&#xD;
softened, as the gnarled- shrub assumes, in slow~unfolding, the&#xD;
graceful mellowed drapery of spring. The. coarse, elfin locks,&#xD;
- grew tamed and. smooth;- a dark blue, in soft and gradual dis-&#xD;
placement, entered the sharp, greenish, animal eyes. The low,,&#xD;

fully-occupied the spiritual subtilty of the man, as to leave him&#xD;
little time to think of himself.&#xD;
The loathsome contact of the reptile mother daily grew more&#xD;
abhorrent to him; and her characteristic cunning soon disco-&#xD;
.-.                  -.&#xD;
yered that she had no real hold upon him herself, and at once&#xD;
encouraged this growing interest in the daughter, with the same&#xD;
assiduous art that she had before displayed, in tormenting her&#xD;
with jealous gibes. Through this help she:hoped he might be&#xD;
held within her reach. 'She had already, by her malapert, silly,&#xD;
malignant interference, so far completed his ruin as to have&#xD;
brought about a desperate, and finally fatal collision, between&#xD;
himself and his business associate in the Journal, which his&#xD;
genius had built up; and-now he was thrown again to struggle.&#xD;
hap-hazard with"the world, he had become' more reckless and&#xD;
'desperate: than before, -so that she .feared he might, at any time-&#xD;
break away-from'his bondage, and that, too, while he was still&#xD;
of use to her, and before she had gloated fully upon his ruin.&#xD;
She had studiously taught the child the process of those infernal&#xD;
arts, of which we have seen something; and, although the crea-&#xD;
ture understood nothing of the rationale involved, yet her imi-&#xD;
tative cunning made her a most sharp pupil and practitioner.&#xD;
By saying that the child did not understand, we mean to con-&#xD;
vey, that she could not have explained to herself, or to others&#xD;
what effect certain manipulations would produce specifically;&#xD;
yet she had a feeling-of them, a vicious intuition, that answered&#xD;
with her all the purposes of intellection. To look at her&#xD;
through the eyes of Manton, the uncouth and grotesque girl&#xD;
had become a fond and graceful plaything, that clung about him&#xD;
in soft caresses; that kept his heart warmed towards her, and&#xD;
caused him to regard the mother even with a modified sense of&#xD;
the growing disgust which was possessing him, and of which&#xD;
her shrewd insight made her fully aware.&#xD;
Her child had become necessary as a bait-.-and"her child let&#xD;
it be-f or, in her hideous creed, nothing was sacred. She was&#xD;
filled towards her victim with fierce yearnings, and, had she&#xD;

possessed the actual entity of soul, would have loved him&#xD;
madly- but no, she hated him, as the slave hates the despotic&#xD;
master.to whom he hourly' cringes for each favor. In aword,&#xD;
she ad him as a man-or in his double capacity of. a spiritual&#xD;
being,-rather,; and, as'even her hate was secondary, her appe-&#xD;
tites towards him were those of the weir-wolf for mankind-&#xD;
She would devour him body and soul, but she meant to feast&#xD;
alone.       s&#xD;
Fearing .lest the. tenderness, of his nature might be too&#xD;
strongly moved towards the, child, if not diverted in other di-&#xD;
rections, she- at once set her subtle wits to work to furnish her'&#xD;
"Tiger," as she called him, with sufficient toys of the same&#xD;
kind to 'keep.him quiet, and avert the chances of his leaning&#xD;
more .towards one than another.  Some letters were. hastily&#xD;
despatched to New England, and the result was the appearance&#xD;
of. a fair and gentle child, about the age.of her own.&#xD;
Elna and the stranger;Moions, sprang into each other's arms&#xD;
when they Wet, as if their very heart were one... They were fast&#xD;
friends, it seemed, and. a thousand times had Elna said how&#xD;
dearly she loved the gentle Moione; and so jealous were the&#xD;
children of their first, meeting, that Manton saw little of either&#xD;
for several days.. Glance at the bread, serene brow, great,&#xD;
clear ;eyes, and delicate mouth, of the new-comer, :filled him&#xD;
with a strange, inexplicable -sense of confidence, and even.&#xD;
relief; which he could not well explain, to be sure, because it&#xD;
was too undefined to himself. - He could only wonder how that&#xD;
white-browed creature. came in such .. place. It seemed as&#xD;
though it were a promise, answering t his prayer for the. elfish,&#xD;
Elna, that this calm spirit should have descended in their midst.&#xD;
The vehement arid headstrong. petulance .of her nature pro-&#xD;
mised to find here a balance that would, sober it within the,&#xD;
bounds of reason; and strangely,-although he sa w ,hope for her,&#xD;
and for bis own yet.undefined purpose in her development, he&#xD;
saw:.nothipg definitely in the stranger, but a good angel sent to aid&#xD;
him. His soul went out to greet her,,but was it-'yet his heart?&#xD;
&#xD;
5T11]flUAL SoFTDOwN.              159&#xD;
These children were both dedicate to art; and Manton found&#xD;
it now by -far the most pleasing occupation, to watch and give&#xD;
direction-to the rapid unfolding of this- instinct for the creative.&#xD;
The newly-aroused intellect of Elna here displayed' man yFhapish&#xD;
and brilliant characteristics- of the imitative faculty, that might&#xD;
easily have been mistaken, by a less partial observer than Man-&#xD;
ton, for genius. These peculiarities were strikiiigly contrasted&#xD;
with the placid, but vigorous style of Moione, to'-a degree that&#xD;
one formed the exact offset to the other, not alone in art, but&#xD;
in all physical and mental, as Well as spiritual idiosyncrasies.&#xD;
As these. children grew upon him, there seemed something&#xD;
strangely familiar in them to Manton. He often tried to ac-&#xD;
count for this to himself. Had he seen them before in dreams?&#xD;
Had he known them in some different world, and-ina) previous&#xD;
stage of 'being?  Why was it that the vehement-.eccentricities&#xD;
of temper, the elfin wildness of motion, and light, mocking&#xD;
spirit of this child Elna, all seemed to him so familiar ? Why&#xD;
was it that the coming of the fair-browed Moione had surprised&#xD;
him so little ? There was that in her 'pure, calm face to startle&#xD;
most observers; yet, from the first,, he had looked upon it as a&#xD;
matter of course, and as if he had unconsciously waited for her&#xD;
to arrive. Why was it that he had felt comforted since she-&#xD;
came?   What was it, in that name of hers, that sounded to&#xD;
him so much like a half-forgotten music-note? -&#xD;
So he had-questioned himself a thousand times, becoming&#xD;
each day more puzzled than the last, until accident furnished&#xD;
him with the curious solution of this mystery. One, day, in&#xD;
looking over a pile of old manuscripts, he found one, upon&#xD;
whidh he seized, with an unaccountable thrill. In .an instant&#xD;
the whole thing flashed upon him-&#xD;
"I have it! I have it!, - Here the mystery is solved at last!&#xD;
Strange, that I should so utterly have forgotten this manuscript!&#xD;
Two years ago, before I ever saw these people, this strange&#xD;
foreshadowing ,f what seems now a reality in my life, came to&#xD;
me in a summer's day-dreamn; and I 'wrote it 6ff,-to be thrown&#xD;

derful coincidence. I am no believer in.miracles, but this ap-&#xD;
pears a marvellous reach of. the soul into the future; I was 'con-&#xD;
scious of,nothing when I wrote, but the pleasure of embodying&#xD;
in words what seemed to me, a beautiful -thought; strange, it&#xD;
should have benthus thrown. aside and so utterly forgotten,&#xD;
until,,themncreasingcoincidences of my present relation have&#xD;
gradually forced me back to And it! What blind ._instinct,&#xD;
struggling in me, sent me hereto look through these old manu-&#xD;
scripts,. with no definite purpose?  What vague struggle of&#xD;
consciousness; and memory is this, that has been moving me for&#xD;
weeks to understand why it is those children seem so familiar to&#xD;
me?   Strange! strange! strange!"&#xD;
Manton now proceeded to read this curious manuscript, the&#xD;
contents of which we shall alsoplace before you:--&#xD;
THlE LEGEND OF THE MOCKING-BIRD.&#xD;
Friend, do you know the Mocking Bird ? I warrant, if he is_&#xD;
a familiar:of your childhood, you have a thousand times won-&#xD;
dered at the strange malignant intelligence which characterises&#xD;
his tyrannical supremacy over all the feathered singers. Not'&#xD;
only is he "accepted king of song," but he is the pest and&#xD;
terror. of- the groves and meadows. 'Spiteful and subtle, he&#xD;
conquers in battle, or by manoeuvre, all in  reach of him; and&#xD;
you may easily. detect 'his favourite-haunts, by the incessant din&#xD;
and clatter of wrath. and fear he keeps up by his malicious&#xD;
mockery:among his neighbors. From my earliest childhood, I&#xD;
can remember having been singularly impressed by the-weird&#xD;
and curious humors of this creature. Since those, times ,of in-&#xD;
nocent wonder, I have been a wide wanderer. The preposses-&#xD;
sions of my fancy were irresistibly attracted by the wild -legend-&#xD;
I gie below.v' It was told me by an old Wako warrior.&#xD;
On a hill-side, above an ancient village of his tribe, while we&#xD;
were stretched upon the grass beneath a moss-hung live-oal he&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
ETIERIAL' SOFTD&amp;amp;WN.             161&#xD;
related it; The moon was- out, gilding with silver alchemy the&#xD;
shrub-crowded crests of prairie undulations-piled, as we may&#xD;
conceive the wavest of the ocean would be-stayed by a word&#xD;
from heaven, while on the leap before a tempest. It -was a&#xD;
fitting scene for such a story. Out from- the dark-gorges on&#xD;
every side ascended the night-song-of the mocking-bird. The&#xD;
old man had listened tothe rapid gushing- symphonies for some&#xD;
time in silence, then drawing, a long breath he remarked-" That&#xD;
is an evil bird !" I begged him for an explanation, and he pro-&#xD;
ceeded.&#xD;
Those peculiarities, indeed, of the Indian's phraseology-&#xD;
those broken-pointed expressions, so condensed and meaning,&#xD;
and eked out continually by significant gestures, I could hardly&#xD;
hope to convey, were I fully able to remember them. The&#xD;
wild and fanciful methods of the Indian mind, believing what&#xD;
it dwells upon, yet half conscious that it is dreaming, are diffi-&#xD;
cult to remember or repeat. We can only do the best we 'may&#xD;
to preserve the idiosyncracies.&#xD;
"Yahshan, the Sun," said the, old chief, pausing reverently&#xD;
as he uttered the name, "in his great wigwam beyond 'the big&#xD;
waters, made the' first Wako! He laid him in his fire-canoe&#xD;
and oared his way up through the thick mists that hungevery-&#xD;
where. When his arm tired of pulling,' he took him out and&#xD;
stretched him upon his back on a wide dark bank,' and then&#xD;
rowed on his path andieft him. The Wako lay like the stem&#xD;
of an oak, still and cold. -Before Yahshan entered his night-&#xD;
lodge in the west, a dim hazy light had hung{ over 'the figure,&#xD;
but this only made its' broad couch look blacker-for nothing&#xD;
that' had form 'could be seen. Yahshau, the Moon--the- pale&#xD;
bride of Yahshan-came forth when he had gone in, and rowed&#xD;
her silver bark through the- ugly shadows above the -Wako, to&#xD;
watch lest the spirits that hated Yahshan should do harm to his&#xD;
work, which it had taken hin many long. "ages to finish. .,He&#xD;
was very proud of it, and the evil 'spirits'hated him that he had&#xD;
made a thing so goodly to look upon ; and they drifted hideoun"&#xD;

phantom shapes, across the way of Yahshau, and tried to over-&#xD;
whelm her light canoe, but-its keen shining prow cut through&#xD;
them all, and left them torn and ragged, behind her. At last&#xD;
they ned, for when her eye was'on' the mute:form of the Wako,&#xD;
they feared to do it any harm. When all were gone, and&#xD;
nothingqthat looked'like mischief was to 'be seen, she too went&#xD;
in. And.then they flocked out from the. deep places where&#xD;
theyhad been hid, and-gathered with hot fingers and red eyes&#xD;
-,;about the quiet'Wako. He did not stirfor his senses had riot&#xD;
yet been waked; Quick they pried open his clenched teeth, and&#xD;
poured a green smoking fluid down his throat. Just then the&#xD;
prow of the fire-canoe appeared parting the eastern mists, and&#xD;
they all fled.&#xD;
"Yahshan came on, He looked upon his work and smiled&#xD;
-for he did not know that evil had been wrought-and came&#xD;
now in glory, riding on golden billows, scattering the chill mists&#xD;
that clung-around the icy form,. for it was time to waken it up,&#xD;
with life. He rolled the yellow flood, upon it, and the figure&#xD;
shivered ; again the glowing waves pass over it-.Athe figure was&#xD;
convulsed-tossed.itslimbs about, and rocked to and fro. Its&#xD;
eyes were open, but it saw not; its ears were open, but it heard&#xD;
not;,it was tasteless and dumb ; it smelt not, nor did it feel.,&#xD;
Life had gone into, it, and the heart beat, the, pulses throbbed,,&#xD;
the blood coursed fast, and it was monstrous =strong. But what&#xD;
was 'this ? Being, self-fed .and self-consumed, hung upon the&#xD;
void of 'midnight, hurried and driven 'from its own still gather-&#xD;
ing impulse '-through a chaos of ,crude matter., That green&#xD;
liquid of the evil one now rushed in burning currents through&#xD;
the veins, and it dashed away, crawling, leaping, tumbling, like&#xD;
a mad torrent, over piled-up rocks across" the dark plains,&#xD;
striking'against hard, formless things, and rebounding to rush&#xD;
on more swiftly, till it had left the fire-canoe and Yahshan all&#xD;
astounded, far behind, and the terror of darkness was beneath&#xD;
and above it  But what was this to it?  On ! on ! the green'&#xD;
fire still burned' within, and it m~ust. go---chasms'and cliffs, with&#xD;

jagged rocks--into them, over them all. What were rough&#xD;
points and bruises,'and crashing down steeps, 'and midnight to&#xD;
it ? There was no feeling, yet the 'heart leaped, the blood&#xD;
careered, .the limbs must follow.- Motion, blind motion-no&#xD;
control, no, guide-but through and over everything,-move it&#xD;
must.&#xD;
" The bad spirits thronged after it, grating and clanging their&#xD;
scaly pinions against each' other, and creaking their pleasant&#xD;
gibes, vhen suddenly there was, no footing, and the headlong&#xD;
form pitched down, downward, whirling through 'the empty&#xD;
gloom, while all the herd of ill things.laughed and flapped them-&#xD;
selves in the prone wake behind it.&#xD;
" At once, with a sigh 'of wings, like a sharp moan of tree-&#xD;
harps,, a shape of light shot arrowy down amidst them. They&#xD;
scattered, howling with affright. It bore up the filling Wako r&#xD;
on strong, shining vans an instant, then stretching' them out,&#xD;
subsided slowly, and laid it on a soft, dark couch again. This&#xD;
was Ah-i-wee-o, the soul of harmonies, the good spirit of sweet&#xD;
sounds. She is the great. queen of spirit-land. Yahshan and&#xD;
Yahshauare her slaves; and all the lesser fire-canoes that skim&#xD;
in Yahshau's train obey her, She gives tall life its outer being.;&#xD;
to know and feel beyond itself-without her, life is only motion.&#xD;
There is no form, no law, no existence beside, for'.she holds&#xD;
and grants them each sense,. and in' them reveals all these.&#xD;
Yahshan could give life-but not content with this, he was- am-&#xD;
bitious. . The formless chaos his fire-canoe sailed over must be&#xD;
a world of beauty! A soul dwelt in.it, but that world was pas-&#xD;
sionless and barrei.- Yahshan had given life. to many shapes,&#xD;
but the cold spirit had scorned them all; and yet she must be&#xD;
wooed to wed herself to life, that,,out of the glow of that em-&#xD;
brace, might spring the eternal round of thoughts made vital,&#xD;
clothed out of shapeless 'matter with symmetry. He planned&#xD;
an impious scheme. He would not pray the good'Ah-i-wee-o&#xD;
for aid, but would act. alone, and be the great 'Medicine Spirit.&#xD;
He would frame a creature from out the subtlest elements within&#xD;

this chaos, so exquisite .that, when it cane to live, confusion.&#xD;
would be harmonised in it, and the order of its being go forth&#xD;
their law of beauty and of form to all. Then that coy spirit of&#xD;
desolation would be won at last, and passing into- its life, a royal&#xD;
lineage would spring forth, and procreation wake insensate&#xD;
matter in myriad living things, gorgeous ideals, harinoniously&#xD;
wrought, -and' self-greducing forever. All these would be his&#xD;
subjects, and 'he would rule, with Yahshau, this most excellent&#xD;
show himself! So he labored on, in the deep chambers of his&#xD;
night-lodge, through many cycles. The work was finished. It&#xD;
lay in state, within his golden wigwam at the east, that Yahshau&#xD;
and her 'glittering train might look upon it and wonder. Then&#xD;
he carried it forth; but evil spirits are wise,'and, though it was&#xD;
a nijghty work, they knew that it was too daring, and that Aha&#xD;
i-wee-o' would punish' its presumption, and would not let the&#xD;
senses wake with life ; so they poured that fearful fluid in,&#xD;
that fires the blood, and makes life slay itself. They say the*&#xD;
white man has dealt with them, has learned from them the spell&#xD;
of that' bad magic, and makes his " fire-water" by it. So when&#xD;
Yahshan waked up life,.its power waked too; for he knew not&#xD;
of the craft,'and, it tore the glorious work from out' his hands,&#xD;
While they flew behind and mocked him..&#xD;
"Ah-i-wee-o bent ,over the swooning Wako; for the life that&#xD;
had been soi tumultuous scarcely now'stirred his, pulse. She&#xD;
was a thing of beams, silvery' and clear ; a warm, lustrous light&#xD;
clung around-her limbs and showed their delicate outline.' She&#xD;
floated on the'air,'her wings and figure waving with its eddies,&#xD;
like -the shadows of a Lee-kaloo bird'upon the sea. Her eyes;&#xD;
deep.as'the fathomless blue 'heaven,, looked down on him with'&#xD;
pity and unutterable' gentleness. It was a marvellous work the-&#xD;
overdaring Yahshan had accomplished. Beautiful, exceedingly,&#xD;
was that 'mute form, and; rarely exquisiteRits finish. Must that&#xD;

and it was fair,to view, and perfect as -when Yahshan bad given&#xD;
it the last touch. Now she stooped beside and touched him,.&#xD;
white sparks 'flew up, and she sang a low song. At the first&#xD;
note, the dark, formless masses round them quivered and rocked:&#xD;
the Wako smiled; .for feeling now first thrilled along his nerves.&#xD;
The song rose ; the 'dumb things shook and stirred the more.&#xD;
She touched his nostrils and his lips; the sparks played between&#xD;
her small fingers and danced up. Yet a louder note swelled&#xD;
out, and 'the thick mists swayed. and curled, and a cool wind&#xD;
rushed through them, and dashed a stream of odor on -his, face.&#xD;
He drew long breaths, and sighed with the burden of delight,&#xD;
and moved.his lips to inarticulate joy; and-now that wondrous&#xD;
song pealed out clear,=ringing bursts that shook the blue arch&#xD;
and swung the fire-boats, cadent with its gushes-; and through&#xD;
the dim' mists great shapes, like rocks and trees, leaped to the&#xD;
measure, marshalling inlines and order. Now she pressed his&#xD;
eyelids with her fingers; the silver. sparks sprung in exulting&#xD;
showers, snapping and bursting with sweet smells. 'Once more,&#xD;
pealing triumphant, a keen, shining flood,:that symphony poured&#xD;
wilder forth ; his eyes fly open, and that heavy mist, like a great&#xD;
curtain, slowly rises. First the green grass and, the flowers,&#xD;
bending beneath the gentle breeze, turn their deep eyes and&#xD;
spotted cups towards him in salutation, and all the creeping&#xD;
things and birds, that love the low herbs, dew-besprent, are&#xD;
there: and as the mist goes, up, majestically slow, other forms&#xD;
of bird and beast are seen, and dark trunks of trees, and great&#xD;
stems beside them, looking like-trees, until his eyes have traced&#xD;
them up 'to the great moose, the big-horned stag, the grizzly&#xD;
bear, and the vast-moving mammoth. But then it has drunk&#xD;
the harmony of grades; for all are there. And,.side by side,&#xD;
he marks how, from the crawler, every step ascends, in beauti-&#xD;
ful gradation'; the last linked to the first in one all-perfect chain.&#xD;
Then came the knotted limbs, with all their burden of green&#xD;

and inhaled-all the thoughts of harmony in grarid orgraceful&#xD;

daring rebel to her realm! -No-! he must be ruler here, as 'she&#xD;

on the new sense, and stirs the dead vast.of silence that weighs&#xD;
upon his being. And now myriad soft wavelets of the infinite&#xD;
ocean follow-breaking gently:over him-the whisper of quiver-&#xD;
ing leaves to the .caressing zephyr, the low trenible of the forest-&#xD;

of the north rubbed his jaws against his hand and begged to be&#xD;
caressed. Big iountam (the mammoth) thrust his huge tusks&#xD;
i for a touch; and the white-horned'moose bowed his 'smooth-&#xD;

the huge grotesque things pressed around, and the .smaller&#xD;
creatures, pied, flecked, and dotted, crowded beneath their&#xD;
heavy limbs, unhturt-=all, fulf of confidence and love, gracefully&#xD;
sporting-rto win one glance.&#xD;
"Above him the air was thick with wings, and the whirr and&#xD;
wirinowing of soft plumes made pleasant music, and the play&#xD;
of brilliant hues was -like' a thousand rainbows arched and wav-&#xD;

his face, and gleam their sharp brown eyes intohis, and 'strive,&#xD;

ate, then shook the heavy clusters down for them. Then he&#xD;
passed forth to look upon tire land, the first shepherd, with that&#xD;
countless flock thronging about his steps.&#xD;
"It was, indeed, a lovely land ! Here a rolling meadow, there&#xD;
a heavy wyood; -the -tees ill bearing fruits, or hung with vines&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
SOME SELECT SCENES.&#xD;
SOME short glimpses of daily scenes may convey,' perhaps, a&#xD;
clearer idea of how life sped now with Manton, amidst the new&#xD;
charms which it had gained. The whole man was rapidly&#xD;
changed'; his habits of excess in wire-drikig were, in a great&#xD;
measure, thrown aside, and the hours he. had thus,.wasted&#xD;
in stupifying madness, were given to the society 'and 'develop-&#xD;
ment of these fair children, that had thus come to him in bless-&#xD;
ing. lie now knew no difference in his thought-of them; they&#xD;
had grown to be twin-flowers to him, transfused with a most&#xD;
tender light of spring-dawn in his darkened heart. Yes, there&#xD;
it was - that little spot-of light' h e felt it warm, and slowly&#xD;
spread and waken in soft'beams, 'trerhulous and faint alo he&#xD;
ice-bound chaos where the life-floods met' within him.&#xD;
His brow would grow serene and" Iose its painful tension, as,&#xD;
hour by hour, he watched beside them, guiding their wayward&#xD;

wither-until, with trembling lips and glistening eyes, they hung&#xD;
upon his words.&#xD;
It was wonderful to see how quickly Etna:wept, like.an April,&#xD;
shower, at any tender word or thought; but the great eyes&#xD;
of Molone only trembled like dark violets brimming with heavy.&#xD;
dew. All the truth, the religion of Manton's soul, was poured&#xD;
out at such times.&#xD;
The' door would ' sha   pn&#xD;

she would stagger' backwards, as ifshot through the heart, toss&#xD;

"Auh! 'auh! auh !-yaughk-you kill!-yon kill me!"' and&#xD;

Or else, ith some modification of tactics, the lioness changed&#xD;
to the lamb, the Gorgon-head to that-of Circe, she.would throw&#xD;
herself upon him, with tender expostulations, call him  "che-&#xD;

failed, cling about his knees, and weep and pray, andethen, as&#xD;
the desperate resort, suddenly swoon, with a tremendous crash,&#xD;
upon the floor, and lie there for an hour, if need be, in a con-&#xD;
dition of syncope, so absolute, that Manton-who had.now wit-&#xD;
nessed this comparatively-harmless phenomenon so many times,&#xD;
as to be relieved from any apprehensions ofimmediate results-&#xD;
had lately felt the curiosity of'the philosopher 'irresistibly aroused&#xD;
in him, and would frequently leave her for a considerable length&#xD;
of time, in order to watch the symptoms, before' he proceeded&#xD;
to apply the very simple reniedy for recalling her to conscious-&#xD;
ness, with which, by the way,. she had furnished him long ago,&#xD;
in advance, through certain adroit hints and indirections. ~'When&#xD;
he had satisfied his more analytical moods, in this way, he would&#xD;
proceed with the restorative process, as per prescription.&#xD;
This mysterious operation consisted ii placing the pillowsof&#xD;

vate them atf a. slight anglehigher than the head. As he- was&#xD;
led to understand the result, the-blood,.by-the laws of capillary&#xD;
attraction, was instantly carried up, from, her head to. her feet,&#xD;
thereby relieving the oppression 'of the brain; when Jo! to this&#xD;

The strangesf part ofthis scene consisted in the fact,,That&#xD;
while the fit lasted, it was impossible to perceive the slightest&#xD;
symptoms of-breathing or pulsation, any more than in the most&#xD;
broadly-defined, c se of catalepsy; or of absolute death itself.&#xD;
It was, therefore, clear ,enough to his mind, that such conditions&#xD;
could not be entirely counterfeit; though -the. suggestion had&#xD;
now become -frequnt, that they might,  after long training, be-&#xD;
come, in a great measure, voluntary.&#xD;
Another scene. The mother reclines apon her bed, anV the&#xD;
child 'ia by.,hertside, with arms around her neck and face&#xD;
against- her bosom. Moione stands leaningover the foot-board,&#xD;
with 'folded arms, her pale face expressing mingled grief, anger,&#xD;
and pain, while she looks with a cold, steadfast glanceinto the&#xD;
oblique eye of the woman, :who addresses her rapidly, in bitter&#xD;
tones --&#xD;
4 You lovethat bad man, Moione ?"&#xD;
"Ye;rI -do'!" said the young girl, curtI and coldly.&#xD;
"Ha!' you acknowledge it, do you, ungrateful girl? Ac-&#xD;
knowledge that, 'at your age, you love a profligate wretch like&#xD;
this? a an utterly 'without principle, where our sex is con-&#xD;
cerned. A villain) who has already, attempted The ruin of my&#xD;
own daughter, under my very eyes!"&#xD;
Moione turned paler still at this, and looked. inquiringly to-&#xD;
wards her friend-Elna,,rwho, however, gave. no, sign, either by&#xD;
word or movement, of dissent to this vile insinuation. In-.&#xD;
stantly the blood. mounted- to Moione's brow, and her gentle eye&#xD;
shot lre, her thin lips curled with scorn -&#xD;
It is false-! Itis false! You know it to beso ! "He'has&#xD;
taught us nothing but-what' is' pure and high!' He never&#xD;
breathed a.thought of evil to either of us, and Elna dares not&#xD;
say so! I love him as .our lofty, noble brother, and shall con-&#xD;
tinue to- do- 'so so long as he; shows himself only to me, and to,&#xD;
her, as he has done! .Pray, madam, why do you permit him to&#xD;
remain in 'the house, if he be so wicked?. You tell me' you&#xD;

have the power to turn him out at any minute. Whyiiot do it ?&#xD;
Why do you -trust your. child with him, at all hours, and under&#xD;
all circumstances?- Why do you so constantly-seek his society&#xD;
yourself? If he were. the fiend you represented, one would&#xD;
think you would have reason to fear for yourself, if not for Elna.&#xD;
What he. has done once he rill do again! How do you recon'-&#xD;
cile all this?"&#xD;
The flashing look and withering tone 'in which this unex-&#xD;
pected outburst of indignation, on the part of the usually quiet&#xD;
Moione, had been delivered, cowed the craven nature to which&#xD;
it was addressed. It was but for an instant, thoughJ; her 'subtle&#xD;
cunning returned to the charge, in a lower tone, andion another&#xD;
tack. She reached-out her hand, affectionately, towards her -&#xD;
" Come, Moione, dear! come, kiss me !"&#xD;
The child did not move, but merely answered in a low; con"&#xD;
temptuous "No!"&#xD;
The. woman continued, in a wheedling tone, "Hear! my&#xD;
naughty Moione ! She will not come to kiss me, yhenI love&#xD;
her so! Moione does not understand everything she sees, or&#xD;
she would not haye spoken thus sharply to her friend. ,She does&#xD;
not understand that I am striving to save this poor youth from&#xD;
his frightful Vices! his wine-drinking, his .tobacco, his meat-&#xD;
eating, and all those ugly sins which so deface, what I hope one&#xD;
day to see a beautiful spirit ! She does not know I must endure&#xD;
this evil that good may come'! She does not 'realise how- mdch&#xD;
pain it costs me to have the purity of mj household thus 'dese-&#xD;
crated by his poisoned sphere ! She: does not reineiber that&#xD;
God has placed us here, on this earth, to bear and forbear to-&#xD;
wards his erring children ; that they may,.tbrough us, become&#xD;
regenerate and redeemed! I know his eloquence, I know his&#xD;
subtlety, therefore I have warned you against him; he cannot&#xD;
be dealt with as other men,.for he is but a foolish, headstrong&#xD;
boy, with a great soul, if he were only free; but while his vices&#xD;
hold him in bondage, he is. not to be- trusted. Though I have&#xD;
lifted him out of the very gutters of debasement -given him a&#xD;

home in my house- I have o confidence; at this moment, that&#xD;
he -would, not deliberately ruin either you or Elna to-morrow, if&#xD;
he could ! You should, therefore, rather pity me than be angry&#xD;
with2 me, dearest Molone !"&#xD;
" So;I peceive !' said the young girl with a cold sneer, as&#xD;
she turned and walked haughtily from the room, Slamming the&#xD;
door emphatically behind her. The woman sprang to her feet,&#xD;
witi an expression of ungovernale fury in here face.  The&#xD;
insolent, ungrateful wretch! This is what I get for all' my&#xD;
trouble to make something out of her-to render her of some&#xD;
value to me! To sa-a-ve her!" and she hissed out the words&#xD;
with a horrible writhingHof her- features, while the pupl of her&#xD;
oblique' eye was wrung aside, until- nothing but the white,&#xD;
ghastly blank of the ball-was to -be seen.-&#xD;
"Yes Ill save you! I'll use you; you insolent beggar! I&#xD;
have not brought you- here, alone, as the ant carries' off the&#xD;
aphide, to give spiritual milk to my--own offspring ! I brought,&#xD;
you to.usetoo, and use you I will! I will coin you into profit !&#xD;
I'll 'humble your insolent airs! I've got a market. for you&#xD;
already, and a bidder! Dare to cross, my path, ha ?-with&#xD;
your supercilious insolence - I'll bow that. white forehead! I'll&#xD;
fill those blue eyes with ashes! until, blearedd and rheumy with&#xD;
premature decay, you crawl tokis my foot for favors !"&#xD;
-During this horrid apostrophe, the woman had stood stiffened&#xD;
where she had first planted her feet --upon the carpet, staring&#xD;
blankly at the, door through which the young girl had passed,&#xD;
and throwing her.,arms out in wild gesticulations after her.&#xD;
The girl Elna lay, in the meantime, with her face half con-&#xD;
cealed -in the- pillow, closely watching, with one sharp eye&#xD;
uncovered, the whole scene. The woman, who had forgotten-&#xD;
herself in her fury, turned suddenly and saw her. Her manner&#xD;
-istaptly: changed.. She threw--herself by her side, took her&#xD;
caressingly into her arms, drew her face close to tiers, breathed&#xD;
upon it long and steadily, and then commenced in low, confi-&#xD;

Another scene. About this time, Manton had effected the&#xD;
advantageous sale of a new work, which placed -him suddenly&#xD;
in the possession of a larger sum of money than he had been&#xD;
able to cominmand, at one time, for a long. period. ' His, first&#xD;
thought was for lhis young proteges, ands although his own ward-&#xD;
robe was- sufficiently dilapidated, he expended a portion of the&#xD;
sum for their comfort and gratification before he thought .at all&#xD;
of his own necessities.  Unluckily for him, however, it was&#xD;
evening when the money was received, and the purchases in-&#xD;
tended to surprise them were the only ones made on'the way to&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
In almost boyish eagerness, and all breathless with the de-&#xD;
light4 of giving joy to -these gentle ones he loved so much, he&#xD;
hastened home and threw his presents down before them, to be&#xD;
greeted- with rapturous expressions :and gleeful- merriment, the&#xD;
silvery and most musical clamoring of which, soon brought the&#xD;
woman, Marie, to the scene., Her eyes danced. and glistened&#xD;
as she saw them; her infallible instinct scented the money in an&#xD;
instant.,&#xD;
" Beautiful! beautiful !" she- exclaimed, clapping her hands&#xD;
with childlike-artlessness. 6 "How lovely! How sweet! How&#xD;
noble !' How generous of you to think of these.dear girls first,&#xD;
when you need so much yourself!" and she looked up with be,.&#xD;
witching candor into the face of Manton, though it might have&#xD;
been noticed by more careful observers that one eye- turned ob-&#xD;
liquely towards his pockets. - She -sprang suddenly to his side,&#xD;
and lent affectionately against-his arm, which she clasped with&#xD;
both her hands..&#xD;
"Ah,-my gentle Tiger ! How shall I ever thank you for;your&#xD;
unwearying kindness to these my tender blossoms ? My precious&#xD;
' Monies!l' Youi are too good! We shall never know how to&#xD;
thank you.enough-l"&#xD;

&#xD;
And leaning still- closer and in a 'more confidential.manner&#xD;
towards his ear, while her 'forehead flushed ,and. her voice sank,&#xD;
"You sold the book," did you ?"&#xD;
For how much ?"&#xD;
"The feeeipts in my pocket will show !"&#xD;
"Ah, let us see them then !''said she playfully, as she thrust&#xD;
her hand into his pocket. "I want to see if those' evil and&#xD;
stupid publishers' have understood the' value -of the precious&#xD;
genius they were purchasing !.- Oh, dear, why what a treasure !&#xD;
Here are' fifties, twentties, ever so many!" while-she, with eager&#xD;
and trembling- hands, fumbled the notes that she had snatched&#xD;
from the vest-pocket where.he had,. with his. characteristic are-&#xD;
lessness of money, thrust them loosely. '" Ah, I must take time&#xD;
to count' all this treasure for you, for I do n't believe you know&#xD;
how much you 'ye got; you careless boy!". And as she said&#xD;
this she hastily deposited the, money in the bottom of her pocket.&#xD;
Manton looked at her a moment with a very' hard, cold&#xD;
glance, while a-flush of indignation gleamed across .his brow ;&#xD;
for he had a sure presentiment that he -should never see 'this&#xD;
money again. The great'misfortune of his'organisation Wasrhis&#xD;
recklessness in regard to money, and the absolute inability of his&#xD;
nature to, comprehend the sterile meannesses of its abject wor-&#xD;
shippers. - For' the first time the impulse to strike thisswoman&#xD;
to the earth came across hir, but in an instant this 'angry feeling&#xD;
was dissipated amidst the gay and laughing caresses of his petted&#xD;
favorites.&#xD;
When, on the next day, Manton demanded of the woman, an&#xD;
account-of the money, she turned pale and red, looked upwards&#xD;
and downwards, and finally askance, while she faintly told him&#xD;
that she had spent the whole ; but, for his good, as well as that&#xD;
of.the dear' girls' and herself, "for," she said, "you know you&#xD;
are so. 'careless, about money, so generous, so liberal, that you.&#xD;
would .have thrown it all away without accomplishing any of the&#xD;

do the best for us all !" and as she saw the brow of Manton,&#xD;
who had not-uttered a word, settling, darker and darker above&#xD;
his cold dilated eyes, she sank upon her knees at his feet, and&#xD;
clasping his in her arms, she plaintively plead -.&#xD;
"Ah, forgive me! forgive me! I acted for the best ! For&#xD;
God's sake do not look so, you will kill me !"&#xD;
He spurned her contemptuously from him with his foot, and&#xD;
retreating, as she. crawled abjectly back again, he ,said in a&#xD;
measured, deliberate tone -&#xD;
'.Keep away from me, woman! You may, retain your ill=&#xD;
gotten plunder once more, but, mark you, if ever you dare to&#xD;
put your hands into my pockets again I will strike you to the&#xD;
earth, woman as you are, and trample you beneath my feet, as&#xD;
I would another reptile ! I have had enough of this remorseless&#xD;
fleecing!" And spurning yet more contemptuously her persistent&#xD;
attempts to clutch his knees .again, he left her swooning upon&#xD;
the floor. He went forth with the scales falling from his eyes&#xD;
regarding this woman, in some particulars at least.&#xD;
The sequel to the last scene is too rich to be passed over.&#xD;
Since that wholesale and- impudent robbery, Manten had main-&#xD;
tained his ground firmly, in regard to money. 'All her-arts were&#xD;
brought to bear,"in vain; he steadily and sternly refused to be&#xD;
plundered any farther; until finally, his feminine 'tsaviour"&#xD;
being driven to the extreme verge of desperation, tried-,a new&#xD;
and dashing game.&#xD;
She had just been reading Zschokke's charming tale, " Illumi-&#xD;
nation, or the Sleep-Walker."  The'reader will reniember how&#xD;
the   ,-Sleep- Walker, the heroine of the tale, instructs:Emanuel;&#xD;
while in the clairvoyant state, as to how he"should proceed in&#xD;
her own case, which 'he had -been elected to restore to health&#xD;
again, through the nervous, or sympathetic medium, by re-es-&#xD;
tablishing the balance of the lost physical with thespiritual life.&#xD;
That, in. addition, the Sleep-Walker revealed to him" 'the&#xD;
thoughts of his own soul, and counselled him as an angel would&#xD;

hate done, against the evil she saw in him-tells him too, that,&#xD;
he must not regard her weakness, or' the petulance of her words&#xD;
owards him in her waking state..&#xD;
Well, our clairvoyant, after reading 'this book herself, exhib-&#xD;
ited an unsual degree of restlessness to have it read by Man-&#xD;
ton, too ; nothing would content hfler until he had fairly com-&#xD;
menced it, -when she know there was no probability of his&#xD;
pausing until he got through. She watched him during the&#xD;
reading, with great curiosity, frequently interrupting him to draw&#xD;
out his opinion as, he progressed.&#xD;
Everybody knows the fascination of the tale, and 'confesses&#xD;
the fine skill with which its wonderful details are wrought up.&#xD;
Manton could do no les ; he was charmed, of corse, as mi-&#xD;
ions of other readers have been. A few hours after finishing&#xD;
the book, while sitting at his table, engaged in writing, the door,&#xD;
which was vnbolted, flew open wide, and there stood Madame,&#xD;
dressed in pure white-the eyes nearly closed, and features pale&#xD;
and rigid, the outstretched hands reaching vaguely forward, after&#xD;
the manner of the somnambulist.&#xD;
She paused- for;a moment thus--while the whole meaning of&#xD;
the scene flashed through the mind of Manton in an instant ; 'and,&#xD;
although he felt a very great inclination to laugh, he restrained&#xD;
himself, and determined to encourage the thing, and -see how&#xD;
f4r it would go. The new Sleep-Walker now advanced slowly&#xD;
towards him; and as she crossed the room, a slight movement&#xD;
9f her fingers beat-the 'air before her, a. if through the guidance&#xD;
of these magnetic poles her soul sought its centre of attraction ;.&#xD;
with a slow, gliding mQvement she thus approached, until within-&#xD;
a few inches of him,-when her hand leaped, as the magnet does&#xD;
"  to' the stone, to meet his, and then a 'certain painful rigidity that&#xD;
had marked her brow at first, was -displaced and gave way to&#xD;
a serene expression of content, as if she had now found rest.,&#xD;
'That peculiar action of the muscles of-the throat, as if in the&#xD;
effort to swallow, now followed immediately, and was sufficient&#xD;

intimation to Manton that she desired to speak. lHe accordingly&#xD;
asked her, solemnly--&#xD;
"Why are you here ?"&#xD;
But there was-evidently something of mockery in the tome in&#xD;
which this question zwas asked, for 'the Sleep-Walker only&#xD;
frowned and shook her head impatiently. Manton now changed&#xD;
his voice, and with real curiosity, proceeded.&#xD;
"Speak: why have you come to me thus? What would you&#xD;
say to, me.&#xD;
After some four or'five efforts to, produce sound,' she articu-&#xD;
lated-&#xD;
"For your good."&#xD;
" Tell me then, what is for my good ?"&#xD;
She again frowned and shook her head and muttered-&#xD;
" You are ,naughty."&#xD;
" Why ?"&#xD;
"You have no faith."&#xD;
"Faith in what ?"&#xD;
"Faith in me-in my mission-in my truth."&#xD;
"I have faith in you-tell me what is for my.good. -&#xD;
" You must be more humble ; your pride and your suspicion&#xD;
will never let you be saved. -You must have some hard lessons&#xD;
yet to bring you down-to humiliate you-to purify."&#xD;
Here there was a long pause, when Manton, growing' impa-&#xD;
tient, finally asked--&#xD;
"Is this all you have to say to me? Is this all you see now-?"&#xD;
'No."&#xD;
"Well, what is it?"&#xD;
After considerable hesitation, she at length said,&#xD;
"You do not treat me right !--you hold my life in your-&#xD;
hands-yet you are cold--you do not come near' me-you are&#xD;
leaving me to die !"&#xD;
Here then was another long pause.&#xD;
"What more is there ?" at length asked Manton; "this is&#xD;
not all."&#xD;

&#xD;
This time the choking and hesitation, before pronouncing the&#xD;
words,. seemed greater than ever. At length, however, out&#xD;
they came.&#xD;
"They complain of you in Heaven, that you let me suffer--&#xD;
that you do not care for my necessities-that--that you do. not&#xD;
--not--give me money now:"&#xD;
This'was too much-Manton literally roared with scornful&#xD;
laughter, as he spurned. her from him-'&#xD;
" Ha! ha! ha ! here is illumination for yoiq with a vengeance !&#xD;
Alas! poor Zschokke! 'to what base uses do. we come!' The&#xD;
divine inspiration of the Sleep-Walker raising the wind! '-Vive&#xD;
la bagatelle'! Hurrah ! hurrah !"  He fairly danced -about' the&#xD;
floor, in an ecstacy of enjoyment---the scene seemed to him so&#xD;
irresistibly ludicrous.  -&#xD;
During this time, the woman, who had staggered, towards the&#xD;
bed, and fallen across it, lay perfectly immovable and white,&#xD;
without the change of a muscle, or the quiver of. a nerve.&#xD;
Manton, however, paid no attention to her, and half an hour&#xD;
afterwards, taking his'hat, left the room, .without again approach-&#xD;
ing her. But what was his astonishment on, returning, two&#xD;
hours afterwards, to meet the- sobbing Elna, and the pale,&#xD;
troubled face of Moione; in the passage. Elna, at the sight of&#xD;
him, seemed wild with grief, and sprang, with her arms about&#xD;
his neck, screaming-&#xD;
".Oh, mother is dead! mother is dead ! My dear mother is&#xD;
dead!"&#xD;
" Why,' Moione," said Manton quickly, taking her hand,&#xD;
as he shook Elna off, " what is-the matter? what is all this ?"&#xD;
" She seems to be in 'a fit of some 'sort. We missed her, and&#xD;
after looking all over the 'house' found her lying on they bed in&#xD;
your room, without motion-or breath. We have not been able&#xD;
to wake her since, and did not know what to do until you came."&#xD;
" Oh, come!,do come !" screamed the horrified Elna. "Save&#xD;
my -poor mother!. save her! .save her! You must save her ! I&#xD;
shall die!"&#xD;
&#xD;
ETIERIAL SOFTDOWN.'               183&#xD;
Manton, who immediately felt his conscience sting him,&#xD;
assured the girls that it was merely a mesmeric sleep, from which&#xD;
he would relieve her in a few minutes. He then rushed up-&#xD;
stairs, accompanied by them, and found her, indeed, in pre-&#xD;
cisely the same attitude and'apparent condition in which he had&#xD;
left her. After a few of the usual reverse passes for removing&#xD;
the magnetic influence, she -slowly opened her eyes, while the&#xD;
blood returned to her face. - Starting up and staring about with&#xD;
a bewildered look, she uttered merely an exclamation of surprise,&#xD;
and, then, after rubbing her eyes, quickly asked the poor child,&#xD;
Elna, who had thrown herself sobbing -wildly on her breast---&#xD;
"Why, you foolish girl, what's the matter now ?"&#xD;
"Mother, dear mother, we thought you were dead !"&#xD;
And now came an explanation, so far as the thoroughly re-&#xD;
pentant Manton.was disposed to make it, of the scene we have&#xD;
just described'; the amount of which was, that she--had come&#xD;
into his room in a clairvoyant state, and, being called out-sud-&#xD;
denly, he had left it for an hour or two, forgetting to' make any&#xD;
explanation to" the family, and without having relieved "her, as&#xD;
he should have done, before going, by using the necessary&#xD;
reverse passes.&#xD;
The- incredulity of Manton had never before received -so&#xD;
severe a shock; and it was a long time before his conscience&#xD;
would forgive him, for what now seemed his brutal suspicion.&#xD;
Alas, poor Manton! had he only possessed, for a little while&#xD;
after he left that, room, the invisible cap of the ." Devil on two&#xD;
sticks," he would have been most essentially enlightened as to&#xD;
something of the art and mystery of clairvoyance.&#xD;
As soon as the front-door had slamnied behind him, he would&#xD;
have seen that woman spring to her feet,-and, with lips and&#xD;
whole frame quivering with rage, glide .from the room, mutter2&#xD;
ing to herself; and when she entered her own room, which&#xD;
could be reached through an empty bath-room, he would have&#xD;
heard several low, peculiar raps upon the partition-wall which&#xD;
separated her own from the room of her daughter. These raps&#xD;

were repeated, at intervals, natil a single tap at her door re-&#xD;
sponded, and in another moment the girl Elna glided in on tip-&#xD;
toe. The conference between them was' carried on in a low,&#xD;
rapid, business-like-tone, while every half-minutesthe girl thrust&#xD;
her head from the window, to watch' as for some one' coming.&#xD;
After a few moments'thus spent, the child left 'the room, with&#xD;
an intelligent nod, in answer to the repeated injunction not to&#xD;
leave the window of herown room until she saw him.coming,&#xD;
far up the street.-- and then-!&#xD;
tAfter this, he would have seen the woman quietly seat herself&#xD;
at the table, after locking her door, and, write a long letter;&#xD;
when, on, hearing three low'taps in succession, she sprang to&#xD;
her feet, rushed'tirough the bath-room into- the room of Man-&#xD;
ton, and threw herself across the bed, in the precise position in&#xD;
which he left -herand, after three or four violent retchings of the&#xD;
whole muscular system, her face collapsed-grew ashen-white--&#xD;
her lids drooped---her 'muscles became rigid, and she exhibited&#xD;
all the outward resemblances of suspended vitality. ;'hen the&#xD;
wild Elna rushed in, accompanied by the deluded Moione,"and,&#xD;
the moment she looked at the condition of the mother, burst&#xD;
into- the most extravagant demonstrations of helpless grief;&#xD;
while-Moione, with perfect presence of mind, sprinkled water&#xD;
upon the face and, endeavored to restore animation. Soon the&#xD;
street door-bell rings with a' peculiar energetic pull, and the&#xD;
frantic Elna at once exclaims, "Manton! dear Manton! he can&#xD;
save my mother; let us run for him."  She seizes the hand of&#xD;
Mo one, and--we know the rest&#xD;
Shocking, ludicrous, and monstrous as all this may appear to&#xD;
the reader, 'from his point of view, its only effect upon Manton&#xD;
was necessarily to rebuke-the feeling.of harsh incredulity which&#xD;
was beginning to become so strong in him, with regard to this&#xD;
inexplicable wonan. He was now more troubled and con-&#xD;
founded than he had ever been ; for it was impossible that a&#xD;
nature like his could ever have voluntarily suspected the un-'&#xD;
imaginable trickery e nd collusion which we have traced 'in this'&#xD;
&#xD;
scene; while his common sense was too strong to be in any&#xD;
degree shaken by what was simply unexplained. His 'magna-&#xD;
nimity would not permit him to suspect the full degree of&#xD;
knavery, or his conscientiousness to run such risks, again, of&#xD;
doing grievous injustice,'as it now seemed to.him he had clearly&#xD;
done in'thiscase. He felt it utterly impossible.to treat these phe-&#xD;
nomena with entire disrespect hereafter, however little influence&#xD;
he might permit them to exert upon his fixed purposes and will.&#xD;

coveted conquest had been achieved -Edmond was daily at&#xD;

be approaching when she would no longer need her services.&#xD;
In common with her type the world over, she was credibly&#xD;
selfish and ungrateful, where she had once fawned and cringed.&#xD;
This little weakness of arrogance she had begun to make some&#xD;
slight exhibitions of, even towards  Edmond himself; while, as&#xD;

terrible subtlety-of the reptile she thus hourly trampled with her&#xD;
ruthless scorn. 'She,'too, was doomed to 'feel the fearful pois m&#xD;
of the hidden sting she carried, and writhe beneath its hideous;&#xD;
tortures.&#xD;
There had been 'a more than usually bitter scene between&#xD;
them, in which 'Jeannette- had loftily taunted her with the ab-&#xD;
jectness of the. game she was now playing, in putting forward&#xD;
her own 'daughter, as the attraction, by which to hold Manton&#xD;
any longer near her. It was not.that Madame Jeannette was so&#xD;
much shocked' at any villany in the act itself, but that her lofty&#xD;
pride was revolted at the inconceivable meanness it displayed ;&#xD;
for, as among thieves and robbers, there is among adventuresses&#xD;
a certain esprit du corps,-and the haughty Jeannette aspired to'&#xD;
be a sort of banditti chieftainess in sentiment, and was really a&#xD;
person of refined cultivation, so far as mere intellect was con-&#xD;
cerned,--it is little wonder, that at such a time of unbounded&#xD;
confidence in the security of her own position, and independ-&#xD;
ence, as she"supposed, of any fai-ther aid from the woman, that&#xD;
she should have given way to a natural feeling.of disgust and&#xD;
abhorrence, in a' moment of irritation. But that taunt proved&#xD;
to-her the most, deadly error of her life. '&#xD;
The woman, who feared her presence mortally, left the room&#xD;
hurriedlyand in silence, shivering in an ague-fit of rage. 'In1&#xD;
another moment she left the house, without,'speaking a'word to&#xD;
any one. Indeed, she seemed incapable of speaking. Her eyes&#xD;
looked bloodshot and hideously awry; the veins; of her face&#xD;
swollen as if to  bursting, and the 'skinabsolutely livid.&#xD;
It was: a long walk .she had set out upon, and gradually the&#xD;
headlong rapidity of her gait subsided into a more measured&#xD;
tread. Her face became pale, as it had before suffused, and a&#xD;
sort:of ghastly calmness succeeded. At length, in White Street,&#xD;
she rang the bell of an old-fashioned, but respectable-looking&#xD;
mansion, and shot past the servant in the passage,ivhen, instead&#xD;
of turning into the parlor, she hurried up-stairs to the chamber&#xD;
of the lady.,&#xD;

A somewhat masculine voice answered her tap, and she passed&#xD;
in. A woman of stout symmetrical figure, imperious- bearing,&#xD;
whose somewhat coarse features were relieved by the animal&#xD;
splendor of her large black eyes; the luxuriance of her jetty hair,&#xD;
and voluptuous embonpoint of person, greeted herin a short,&#xD;
abruptstyle, as she looked up with a cold glance from some lace-&#xD;
work over which she was bending.&#xD;
" What is it, Marie? , You look flurried."&#xD;
" No, no," said she, throwing off her bonnet and sinking into&#xD;
a chair. "I'm only tired ! It/s a long walk from my place&#xD;
here ; and then it is very hot to-day. But, Eugenie," she said&#xD;
abruptly, changing her tone, " I came this morning to tell you&#xD;
about Edmond."&#xD;
" What of him ?".said the other sharply, turning full upon&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Dear Eugenie,. the fact is, I could not restrain' myself&#xD;
longer-I should not be acting truly by you or him, if I did so.&#xD;
You know you love him still."&#xD;
The face of the French-woman flushed slightly; her head was&#xD;
thrown back with a haughty 'curve of the neck.&#xD;
" Ah, no," said the woman, interrupting her quickly as she&#xD;
was about to' speak.&#xD;
"No nonsense, Eugenie; you remember that proud as you&#xD;
are, you loved him well enough to risk the loss of your social&#xD;
position for him. You never loved any one- as well since, and'&#xD;
never will again ; and I know that he loves you, and you only,&#xD;
to this hour. It was your pride caused the separation, it is your&#xD;
pride that has reduced him so low as to become,.in sheer de-&#xD;
spair, the victim of such a sapless,. bodiless, dry and sharp-&#xD;
set speculator, as this Jeannette C Why, would you believe&#xD;
it, she has tormented him at last into -apromise to marry her!"&#xD;

her: he's not in earnest-he can't be--he's too proud: and be-&#xD;

"Sit down and'keep cool, Eugenie. I am not mistaken; so,&#xD;
far from it, that every day he comes to me, grievously bewailing&#xD;
his hard fate, in:having so far committed himself to Jeannette,&#xD;
whomhe curses, while he mournsover this obdurate pride of&#xD;
yours; in refuse to see him again. He says if he could only&#xD;
see you once more he would be strong enough to break with&#xD;
Jeannette forever. I've shown him how he could-easily buy her&#xD;
off, in case of reconciliation with you-thather object, from the&#xD;
first, had been simply money, and the eclat of the position it&#xD;
would give her abroad-and that when she had become con-&#xD;
vinced that a separation must take place, she would soon be&#xD;
brought to compromise her claims; Beside, the marriage is im-&#xD;
possible ; I have seen his father and his brother, and have given&#xD;
them some seasonable hints in regard to her; ;and the testy old&#xD;
man now 'swears that he will disinherit, him, if he dares to marry&#xD;
what he considers to be little better than a common ,adven-&#xD;
turess. And the. brother, whom you know is the most influ-&#xD;
entiat-of the two with the old man,.is equally violent about it.&#xD;
So, you see, my dear 'Eugenie, I have been working for you&#xD;
faithfully'all the while, while you considered me as co-operating&#xD;
with Jeannette."&#xD;
"Yes," said. the other,. who had resumed :her seat quite&#xD;
calmly, "I dare.say.I did you injustice, for I had conceived all&#xD;
the time, that it was through you that this' affair, between Jean-&#xD;
nette and Edmond, had been brought about ; that you had had&#xD;
some interest in it you have not thought proper to explairi to&#xD;
me,; and an explanation of which I have not chosen to ask of&#xD;
you. It is quite sufficient for me to know that you now desire&#xD;
to supplant Jeannette, and thereby- undo your-own work. Now,&#xD;
if you choose to explain to me what the object+ you wish to ac--&#xD;
complish is, so that I clean understand your motive, then, per-&#xD;

&#xD;
Come, out with it ! Has Jeannette'crossed your track in any way?&#xD;
Has she foiled you?' In a word, do you hate her now-?"&#xD;
" Of course I hate her, now," said the woman, "or why this&#xD;
visit? Why the deliberate care I have taken to prepare the way&#xD;
to foil her dearest schemes.? She has outraged me beyond en-&#xD;
durance. by her insolent superiority. She frightens, bullies and&#xD;
taunts me, She has insulted me beyond the. possibility of wo-&#xD;
man's forgiveness to another ! I hate het as deeply as I love&#xD;
revenge !"&#xD;
" All this' maybe very.true, Marie," said the other, 'with a&#xD;
cool smile, " but knowing you as I do, I should prefer to be in-&#xD;
formed specifically in what thisinsult consisted. Tell me what&#xD;
she said and did, give me all 'the, circumstances in detail, and&#xD;
then I shall understand your motive and know how far'~woe can&#xD;
act together !"&#xD;
The woman paused an instant as if in hesitation, her'eye grew&#xD;
hideously askance' once more, her forehead blazed, andher lips&#xD;
quivered, as glancing furtively around the room,'with a stealthy&#xD;
movement, she glided closely to the side of-the French-woman&#xD;
and whispered in her ear, with purple lips, a.rapid eager com-&#xD;
munication for a few moments, and then' sank back. into her&#xD;
chair again, pale as death and seemingly exhausted.&#xD;
The French-woman bent her ear to, listen, with her needle&#xD;
.suspended in 5her hand, and as the other finished, a fierce,&#xD;
electric gleam darted from her eye, and with untrembling fingers&#xD;
she finished her stitch, While she said in a low tone'-&#xD;
" That will do, Marie ; that's enough to secure your faith.&#xD;
We will punish ,her. . Edmond' shall corne back to my feet!'?&#xD;
The results of the last scene may be rapidly traced; 'Very&#xD;
soon there commenced a' series of mysterious calls by a- dark-&#xD;
veiled lady, whom 'Manton was induced to suppose wassa patient&#xD;
who. was desirous to retain her incognito.' ,She came and went&#xD;
always at unusual hpurs, and though a vague :suspicion once- or&#xD;

usual going on, yet in his pre-occupation it created but little&#xD;
attention.- But we, who have undertaken from the first to be-&#xD;
somewhat closer and more widely-awakened observers than he,&#xD;
can see something more significant than met his eye in all this.&#xD;
'Anaccidentad meeting in one of the, rooms of the house soon&#xD;
occurred:ibetween Edmond and Eugenie, upon the privacy of&#xD;

In a -few weeks the imperious tone of Jeannette, who, too,&#xD;
t had been kept entirely ignorant of what was going on, was&#xD;
lowered, though the covert and. sardonic vindictiveness- of her&#xD;
wit had clearly lost nothing of its directness and ferocity even;&#xD;
because,- as she daily became less exultant, the moroseness of&#xD;
her temper increased.&#xD;
It would be anything but a pleasant picture to unveil the har-&#xD;
rowing struggles'of such a womar to regain an ascendency,&#xD;
which she felt was daily driven by 'some malign and invisible&#xD;

only felt its -devastation amidst her towering hopes,. and, the&#xD;

She was passing througl'rthe valley and the shadow, yet knew&#xD;
not where to aim the lightning of her curse. She sank at last,&#xD;
bewildered, stunned, and-utterly humiliated ; for she had crawled.&#xD;
upon her very knees to Edmond to plead for mercy, but he was&#xD;
inexorable. The old passion had been restored tothis life, and&#xD;
her proud,'voluptuous rival held the sensual philosopher a&#xD;
prisoner, "rescue or rio-rescue," oncee-more.&#xD;
For days-and days after the tremendous realisation of her'loss&#xD;
had been forced upon her, she lay upon her bed, tossing in dumb&#xD;
anl tearless torture: then her concentrated madness took a new&#xD;
and sudden turn; she shrieked and wailed, she cursed heaven,&#xD;
arid- earth,- and mnen, and even Edrnond, with the lurid curses.&#xD;

cunning science about her suffering bed.&#xD;
But 'Jeannette was clearly not the stuff to die of any one pas-&#xD;

haggard and broken,-and humble enough, but she 'received~her'&#xD;
pension nevertheless, and soon after sailed for England, leaving&#xD;
the field to her stronger rival, to whom Edmond was soon after-&#xD;

CHAPTER  XXI.&#xD;
S ELECT SCENES CONTINUED.&#xD;
WE have. frequently mentioned the eccentric Dr. Weasel in&#xD;
the course of this-narrative. Another scene will enlighten the&#xD;
reader-somewhat in regard to the yet undefined character of his&#xD;
relations towards the woman Marie. He had just entered her&#xD;
room; arid'approaching with a quick, nervous step, he said to&#xD;
her in an irritated and squeaking voice -&#xD;
"Marie Orne, I tell you I musf have my money back again !&#xD;
I did 'not give it to you, when I advanced 'it to get you started&#xD;
in business.. - You were to have returned it.to me, long since.!&#xD;
You have been doing well now for two years and more, and yet&#xD;
instead of returning the money I first ,advanced to you,.you have&#xD;
been borrowing, more than double as much! -At this moment&#xD;
you have more than 'five hundred dollars belonging, to me, of&#xD;
which you have never returned me'-a cent! Yet I have been&#xD;
suffering for money, for months, and you know it! You know'&#xD;
I cannot receive remittances now since the death of my grand-&#xD;
mother, till the settlement of our estate ! I an tired of this treat-&#xD;
ment, Madam! I will have' my money!"&#xD;
The Doctor, who had been walking hurriedly -up and down&#xD;

.iagn, who had quietly continued her writing&#xD;
 Do you hear tne?" he said angrily, in a loud, sharp tone.&#xD;
" Where is the money you have plundered me of?"'&#xD;
The woman now looked up, staring at -him with wide-open&#xD;
eyes that expressed the-nost.unutterable astonishment, while,&#xD;
at the saine n ment; a bland smile. broke across her face, while&#xD;
she -exclaimedin a, lowj, sweet, reproachful voice-&#xD;
" Why, Doctor E. Willamot Weasel! What cai'you mean ?,&#xD;

"Ibelieve you had no door, till I gave- ypu one !" interrupted&#xD;

"Doesc rot that mission exist still ?'11said the woman, with&#xD;
flushing brow, quickly interrupting him. "Has not the number&#xD;
of my patients.,inc eased daily ?-including the first'ladies of the&#xD;

you when you needed, it. I gave you my gold as freely as I&#xD;
would have given you a drink of water, when athirst.'- But you&#xD;
have not been just and true-you have used it selfishly -you&#xD;
have surrendered yourself exclusively to the cabalistic sphere;&#xD;

alted priesthood of the Harmonies, you -)ave steadily dragged&#xD;
him down from the beginning until ow,  when he is further&#xD;
removed than ever'beyond our teach, and regards withcontempt&#xD;
and disgust the very- name of the system with which I had&#xD;
yearned to see him identified;. You have done this, and allfor&#xD;
your own individual and unworthy ends, and have defeated one&#xD;
of my most treasured purposes !"&#xD;
" This is false !" shrieked the woman, as, with flushed face,&#xD;
and with the aspect of a roused tigress, she sprang to her feet,&#xD;
and placed herself directly across the track'- of the excited&#xD;
Doctor.&#xD;
"You lie in your teeth, you ingrate-! It is 'not so! His&#xD;

with scintillating fury..&#xD;
c"You are a fool !" said he, in.a low, smooth tone, ".as well&#xD;

The woman made no attempt -to reply. Her face became; of&#xD;
a sudden, as white and rigid- as death, and, muttering a few&#xD;
choked and guttural sounds, she pitched forward' suddenly, like&#xD;
a falling statue; against the bosom of the irritated Doctor Wea-&#xD;
sel; who, not' a little shocked by the unexpected concussion&#xD;
staggered- backward, for an instant, in 'the utmost 'confusion&#xD;
while her form fell upon the shaken floor. He recovered  is&#xD;
coolness, however, in another morient, and merely muttered, as&#xD;
he left the room--&#xD;
"Pah! nonsense!' The old trick - she's purely in the sub-&#xD;
versive sphere-and I can make nothing of her in.the 'Passional&#xD;

&#xD;
CH AP-TER    XXII.&#xD;
FURTHER REVELATIONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
. ANoTHE1, year had now passed, .which, although it-found&#xD;
Manton not entirely released from his, thrall, had yet left him a&#xD;
calmer and a stronger man. One by one the manacles had fallen&#xD;
off, unconsciously to himself. Hope was slowly filling his dark-&#xD;
ened. life once more with visions of an--emancipated future, and&#xD;
he now even dared to smile in dreams:  -&#xD;
. Whence .came these fairy visitors ?. Ah, he did not understand&#xD;
yet, clearly, in his' own heart. 'He.only felt and welcomed them,&#xD;
fresh-comers from he knew: not what far Eden of God's minis-&#xD;
ters of grace. ,He did not question them-it was joy enough&#xD;
to have had them come down to him in his hell. Perhaps they&#xD;
were but airy counterparts of those- sweet children he had watch-&#xD;
ed over with such fostering tenderness.'&#xD;
But now at,-once a shadow fell upon his dream. Moione, the&#xD;
wise, the- resolute, and the gentle, seemed all at once to droop,&#xD;
to- become wavering and shy, while.Elna.grew, more conscious&#xD;
in her impish grace, and more exultant, more capriciously ten-&#xD;
.der; more caressingly electrical. -Manton could not but observe&#xD;
that although Moione shrank from him now, she held her pencil&#xD;
with a heavy hand, and worked with a hopeless carelessness,&#xD;
while, her lids drooped low and trembled often with a furtive&#xD;
moisture.'&#xD;
Another might have observed:what he. could not 'see, how at&#xD;
such times the eyes of Elna lit with glistening joy, and how her&#xD;
spirit mounted.in rollicking ecstacies-; how she danced and sang&#xD;
like some rmad elf; or¢else her drawing-sheet was spoiled while&#xD;
her pencil went riot over it, in all fantastic drolleries of form,&#xD;
mocking. characters, of every sentiment, and worst of all that&#xD;
&#xD;
she mocked Moione, too, and 'made' him see her heavy brow,&#xD;
and covertly suggested painful questions.&#xD;
"Manton would sometimes see enough of this to startle him&#xD;
gravely, and make .him question his own heart,'long and pain-&#xD;
fully. Elna seemed to watch these moods and dread then, and&#xD;
would break in upon 'them with 'some wild antic or pouting&#xD;
caress.&#xD;
Suddenly Moione \went away, without any other explanation&#xD;
than that she should return to hernother in NewEngland. The&#xD;
thing was done in a cold and resolute way that left no room for&#xD;
explanation. She had-been here-she was gone ; and strangely&#xD;
enoughit was not until now-that Manton realised how-much of&#xD;
light there had been from her presence. Deep shade filled the&#xD;
places which had known-'her once, and it seemed as if his-vision&#xD;
had been illmed - as if the shadow of. that shade' filled Heaven&#xD;
and darkened earth before him. He could not have explained&#xD;
why this was so. It was a voiceless -consciousness, through&#xD;
which he felt a sense, most indescribable, that made him first&#xD;
aware of a great want. It seemed as if the 'moon and stars&#xD;
were gone, with theirscalm inspirations of repose, their pure and,&#xD;
holy beatings, and-that their place about him had been usurped&#xD;
by a red and sultry light, more garish than perpetual day, and&#xD;
clouded in brazen unnatural splendors, too thickfor those star-&#xD;
pencillings to break through, or that chaste -moon to overcome.&#xD;
As the weeping Elna clung about him now, he 'shuddered&#xD;
while he felt that strange, new thrillings crept along his.veins.&#xD;
Why had he not felt this before, when' Moione. was beside&#xD;
them ?. Was 'he=again given over to the evil one? and had the&#xD;
white dove again been banished from his bosom ?- These vague&#xD;
forebodings could never be entirely banished from the heart of&#xD;
Manton, although the lavish tenderness of Elna, who, by-some&#xD;
strange instinct, seemed aware of the struggle; the shadow"and&#xD;
the cause, and wrought eagerly to.dispel them.&#xD;
Elnawas- no longer 'a hild,'if, in reality,' she er had&#xD;
been since Manton 'had 'known' her. 'Sheb atne daily rore&#xD;

and more lovely in his eyes, which soon grew again accustomed&#xD;
to the unnatural atmosphere-surrounding him, though he yearned&#xD;
oleb: for the calmer and the clearer sky he had lost ; yet ashe&#xD;
gave -him little time to think of- the past.  The preternatural&#xD;
activity into which! hers brain had -been roused gave him full emi-&#xD;
ploymentin guiding its eccentric energies. And then: the bud&#xD;
had be g to unfold its petals, as well as give out its aroma.&#xD;
,Her,,sick and wilted frame seemed to have become'suddenly&#xD;
inspired wish a tender and voluptuous sensuousness,-which filled&#xD;
out her graceful limbs in rouinded, bounding vigor, and swelled&#xD;
her line bust with its elastic tension, and lit and deepened her&#xD;
" keen eyes with most lustrous .and.magneticfires.&#xD;
He could not dream long among such conditions.   One&#xD;
morning, as he sat beside her at her drawing, she-'"looked  p&#xD;
suddenly into his face,.and with bewitching naivete remarked-'&#xD;
This ismy-birthday-do you know how old I am?"&#xD;
"No, I never thought."&#xD;
" Well, I am seventeen to-day."&#xD;
"Seventeen! Great God ! is it possible ?' And Manton&#xD;
bowed.his face, coveriiig it with'his'hands, and for a long-time&#xD;
spoke not a word, though his frame trembled. - That magical&#xD;
word; "seventeen," had revealed every thing to himself. He-&#xD;
had as yet always called .her b, the affectionate baby-name of&#xD;
",Sis."3  ,Hebad thought of her only as-a child.;# for through these&#xD;
four weary years he had kept no note of time. He supposed, up&#xD;
to :this monient. that he had been feeling towards her, too, as to-,&#xD;
wards a child-the same saddened, persecuted child which had&#xD;
first attractedlhis sympathies by her mournful expression ofcon-&#xD;
stant suffering. Heihad never once, thought before that any.&#xD;
change had taken place in their-relations;.he had still, fondled'&#xD;
her as a spoiled and petted playmate-; he still attributed the&#xD;
strange thrills her topch Jiad lately produced, in him to a thou-&#xD;
sand -other and innocent causes beside the real.: He had not&#xD;
dreamed of passion;,-he had .only learned to deadly love her, as&#xD;
he thought, because she had been developed beneath his 'hand,&#xD;

and semed, in some, senses, almost a creation of hisown-a&#xD;
sort 'of feminine .elaboration of the thought of Frankenstein&#xD;
within him=--the creature 'of his own daring mind and indomi-&#xD;
table will. Seventeen! seventeen.! Now the whole truth was&#xD;
flooded into his consciousness. She was 'no longer a child-&#xD;
she was 'a woman.' And -he felt that he had indeed loved her&#xD;
as a' woman, while recognising her as' a gaf pet, a play-&#xD;
thing .He now understood how deep, how pure, was the un-&#xD;
utterable fondness that had grown -thus unconsciously into his&#xD;
life, for her, and how monstrous had -.been the .relations into&#xD;
which the mother strove to drag-and hold him.&#xD;
With the first flash; of this conviction, of his real feeling to-&#xD;
wards Elna, camethe purpose, a stern as it was irrevocable.&#xD;
He lifted his head and turned, towards the young girl, with&#xD;
moistened eyelids, and said 'to her solemnly,-and with trembling&#xD;
lips -&#xD;
"Sis!-.- Elna,-do you know that you are no longer a child-?&#xD;
that you are now a woman,?"&#xD;
The blood sprang to her forehead, and, with downcast eyes,&#xD;
she said,'in a faintevoice-.'&#xD;
.I know I'm seyenteen to-day."&#xD;
" Do you know, too, Elna, that we cannot continue to be to&#xD;
each other that we have been ?"&#xD;
"Why, can't ,you be my brother still ?" said she, looking up&#xD;
quickly, as if astonished.&#xD;
"'Because you are a woman, 'dear; and I realise now, for the&#xD;
first time, that I love you as a woman."&#xD;
Her dilated eyes glistened;,for.a mniment, with a strange ex&#xD;
pression of exultation, and,' in: another instant; she threw her&#xD;
arms about the neck of Manton,. and burst ,into the wildest&#xD;
expressions of mingled ecstacy and grief, in the midst of which&#xD;
she sobbed out frequently.&#xD;
" My mother! my poor 'mother.! what will she do ? She will&#xD;
never consent to this'-it will kill her."'&#xD;

to tell her every thing. Promise me to be quiet, and wait till I&#xD;
return. She shall know her doom, in this [same sacred hour in&#xD;
which I have learned to know myself and yot.";&#xD;
She buried her face in her hands ad shivered. as he turned&#xD;
away.&#xD;
He mounted the stairs with calm, unhurried step, and, tap-&#xD;
ping at the.door of the woman's room, it was'opened instantly,&#xD;
and' she met him on the threshold.. Her eyes sought his as he&#xD;
entered, with a strange and troubled glare of inquiry. His&#xD;
brow was fixed, and all his features, seemed just cast in iron.&#xD;
She reached out ,her hand to him, with a vague, quick gesture ;&#xD;
but he did not accept it. He stood up before her, erect, rigid,&#xD;
and impassive. -Her eye grew wilder, and a ypt more furtive&#xD;
and startled, expression glanced across her face, as she. gasped&#xD;
out feebly--.&#xD;
" What now! has it come?"&#xD;
" Yes!"' answered Manton, with a cold, ringing, and metallic&#xD;
tone ; "it has come, woman! The same curse that your devil-&#xD;
ish arts brought upon poor Jeannette, has now come home to&#xD;
roost. We, are for ever severed, and,.on no pretence or artifice,&#xD;
shall, you ever again, come near me. Know you, woman, that&#xD;
I love your child with an honest love-have come to a realisation&#xD;
of the fact, and told her so."'-&#xD;
She reeled and staggered backwards, shrieking-&#xD;
"Ah! ah! ithas come at last! I felt it would be so!&#xD;
There was something in her gait and manner so like stun ed&#xD;
m adness, that Manton involuntarily sprang forward, to catch her&#xD;
wavering form in his arms. She thrust aside his clasp, and,&#xD;
staggering towardsthe bed, fell across it -not in a. swoon,. not&#xD;
in a bleeding-fit; but in a paroxysm of weeping; in which the&#xD;
flood-gates of long'years seemed suddenly opened.- There was&#xD;
no word, no sob, no gesture of impatience, but her eyes ran&#xD;
always a clear flood of silent tears&#xD;

To Manton, 'the phenonenon seemedtmore moving and inex-&#xD;

but always the tearspoured'forth; and for twenty-fdur hours she&#xD;
did not change her posture, or utter any word, but these, 'which&#xD;
sent a chill shiver through the frame of Manton, as he heard&#xD;
them&#xD;
She' will serve you so, too!"&#xD;
'Those. words he could -never forget.  It was a ,weary&#xD;

before the incessant flow of tears began to' be checked, and&#xD;
the woman to 'recover something' of her power'sofpeech, at&#xD;
intervals.&#xD;
The first thing now spoken was,"I must be content. 't can-&#xD;

dumb and sleepless flow' of tears, the calm and unexpected&#xD;
philosophy of this conclusion came to-,his consolation. He had&#xD;
anticipated a 'frantic, obstinate collision.; perhaps as 'savage as&#xD;
~it-anight .prove tragical. And his grateful surprise may be 'con-&#xD;
ceived at the result.&#xD;
So soon'as this result had been attained, he hastened to im-&#xD;
part the news to Elna, whose approach to her mother, while in&#xD;
this condition, had been studiously guarded against by Manton."&#xD;
When he saw:her,' now, in her own room, to which he eagerly&#xD;
hastened, she sprang abut his neck, exclaiming-l&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
ETIIEBIAL SQFTDOW r&#xD;
"W.ill she bear it'?' Can she live ?"&#xD;
" My darling, she has passed through a, terrible struggle,, but&#xD;
she has now awakened to a recognition of what is, and has&#xD;
been, and must continue to be, the falsehood of her purposed&#xD;
relation to me."&#xD;
" Ah !"- exclaimed the young girl rapturously, clasping his&#xD;
neck still closer--"-" Now I may dare to love you as .much as I&#xD;
please!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
ANOTHER INTRIGUE.&#xD;
Wrru all the apparent amount of suffering which we have&#xD;
attempted to describe above, Manton was no little astonished,&#xD;
not only at the promptness and'completeness of'therecovery'of&#xD;
the woman Marie, but at the shortness of the time which she.&#xD;
permitted to elapse before he found her again engaged deep m&#xD;
a bold and characteristic, intrigue.&#xD;
He had immediately determined" that Elna should.be sepa-&#xD;
rated from him until the time of the proposed marriage had ap-&#xD;
proached. While she was to be sent to New England to prose-&#xD;
cute her studies under the charge of an artist friend, he himself&#xD;
proposed to spend the greater part of the year in the northern&#xD;
mountains, hunting, fishing and exploring.&#xD;
But before this prudent and 'proper step could- be taken, a&#xD;
week or so of- preparation became necessary. It was only' a&#xD;
week since the woman had risen from her bed; a showery&#xD;
Niobe, as we have seen, when Manton -entered the house one&#xD;
morning at an hour when he was not expected, he met the wo-&#xD;
man gliding hastily through a passage, with one. of the sleeves&#xD;
of her dress gone. The meaning 'of this sign at once flashed&#xD;
across him, for he remembered to have seen that fair and beau-&#xD;

&#xD;
tiful arm, by skilful accident,'exposed to his own gaze during&#xD;
her first attempts at diverting' and exciting his passions, and he&#xD;
shrewdly conceived that there must be somue now victim on&#xD;
hand, even'already.&#xD;
"Ha!" said he maliciously, as - she was. hurrying past.&#xD;
Why, what's become of your sleeve this morning ?"&#xD;
The woman flushed very red, and her eye- turned obliquely&#xD;
upon him as she muttered confusedly-&#xD;
"I-I've lost-it!"&#xD;
"'Ah, well, come ! Let us look for it !. Let us find it,! The&#xD;
morning is too cold !, I will help you! I fear you will suffer !"&#xD;
"No, no, never mind ! I will find it myself!"&#xD;
"But I insist.! We must find it at once, before you take&#xD;
cold! Come, we will look in the parlor!"  And he. ma4e a&#xD;
movement of his outstretched hand as if'to open the door.&#xD;
She clutched him nervously, saying in a low whisper-&#xD;
"Don't go in there, I have a visitor !",&#xD;
But as Manton only siled at this and showed, no disposition&#xD;
to desist, she continued in an -imploring voice----.&#xD;
"Don't go in! Mr. Narcissus, the editor, is there ! I will&#xD;
get the sleeve and put it on immediately:! Don't disturb us&#xD;
now ; Iam just reading to him-the MS. of my new novel, which&#xD;
I hope he will undertake to publish in. his paper!"&#xD;
"Well," said Manton, qmietly stepping: 'back, "it must' be&#xD;
confessed you are prompt-' in'finding alternatives! I wish you&#xD;
success in your new publishing enterprise! And I suppose this&#xD;
bare arm is to have nothing to do with his anticipated commen-&#xD;
tory upon your text!"&#xD;
Mantonturned away with 'a light laugh, but the look which&#xD;
was, sentafter him. would have chilled his very soul could he&#xD;
have met it. His sneering conjecture wasonly too true: She&#xD;
had already fastened -upon a new victim. " But for once it&#xD;
turned out that it was'" file cut file."  She had at lapt met her&#xD;
equal in all that was detestable--her peer in baseness, and only&#xD;
an under-graduate to her in cunning.,&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN..              205&#xD;
She had -selected him as she did all her victims, with reference&#xD;
to social and,' pecuniary position. He was- at the time a,- co-&#xD;
editor and ostensible part-owner of one of the most brilliant and&#xD;
successful weekly papers of New York. She had always aspired&#xD;
to-command an "organ."   And anything in that line, froni a&#xD;
review down to a thumb-paper, to her, restless a ibition, Vas&#xD;
better than nothing. -For by a process more hideous to the&#xD;
world than anomalous in fact, she had .come to 'reconcile any&#xD;
degree of private intrigue, by balancing it with the value of ab-&#xD;
stract teachings for the public.good, under that liberal:postulate&#xD;
of the school ,to which she belonged, that the end justifies the&#xD;
means.&#xD;
In setting herself down for a regular siege before this news-&#xD;
paper establishment, she had first iii- her eye, all three of the&#xD;
associate owners. - It was a matter of entire indifference to her,&#xD;
through which she succeeded in obtaining an entrance to its&#xD;
columns, which might lead to her control of the future tone of&#xD;
the paper.. She opened the investment in the-usual form; fire,&#xD;
by visiting them alone, in their offices;'then by bombarding&#xD;
them, from the distance of her own writing-table, with a con-&#xD;
stant hail of those snow-white missives, with the sugared con-&#xD;
tents of which we have before been made acquainted.&#xD;
They were each privately and successively pronounced in&#xD;
their own ears, and under 'eal .of those crow-quilled envelopes,&#xD;
to be "naughty boys," whose proud and wilful natures were&#xD;
driving then headlong to ruin-to be sons of genius, whoonly&#xD;
required to be saved from themselves and their own vices, by&#xD;
her, to become the illustrious reformers of the age! One of&#xD;
them sinoked-too much-was making a " chimney of his, nose,"&#xD;
through which he was exhaling spiritual mightiness, that might&#xD;
equalise hin with the cherubim, if only free! Bit this unhap-&#xD;
pily did nqt tell; the shrewd and wary business-man, who knew&#xD;
more aboutcoppers than cherubim, and was by no means con-&#xD;
scious of the spiritual prowess she so pathetically attributed to&#xD;

&#xD;
him,,"smoked" her, or her motive at least, and threw the dainty&#xD;
correspondence aside, with a jeering laugh.&#xD;
The other,+-who was really chief editor, and a handsome and&#xD;
talented fellow, might not have gt off so'well, had he not been&#xD;
pre-occupied, .and predisposed to bestow the exalted attri-&#xD;
butes which she had discovered in him, in another direction.&#xD;
He wag duly grateful to'"her, however, for the discover that he&#xD;
was a child of genius; -and, though a little disposed to be sus-&#xD;
picious, could not, for some time, restrain the expression of his&#xD;
delight at having' met with a lady possessing such unquestion-&#xD;
able and extraordinary discrimination.&#xD;
He was a jovial and generous fellow, though very shrewd and&#xD;
suspicious withal.  She was not quite' aware of the last two&#xD;
attributes, aid therefore. expected a great deal from him, as he&#xD;
proverbially drank too much. She, therefore opened her bat-&#xD;
teries .merelessly upon this weakness, which, as she -affirmed,&#xD;
combined with the horrible practice of chewing to excess, was&#xD;
demonisirg an "Archangel! Dragging down the loftiest spirit&#xD;
of -his.  age ! A spirit that migIht guide the destinies of the&#xD;
human-race, and. rule it, whether for evil'or for good."  She&#xD;
particularly desired his salvation. -She prayed for' it, day&#xD;
and night!   She had, a spiritual monition that -he could&#xD;
be saved ; and the fact was, he would be saved, if he would&#xD;
only listen to her counsel! Indeed, she might guarantee he&#xD;
should be saved; if he would-only give up his poisons, and&#xD;
dedicate the columns of his paper to the great cause of pro-&#xD;
gressive hygiene and popular physiology. In a word, the fact&#xD;
was, he must be saved, whether he wanted to be or-not!&#xD;
But the-trouble was, our editor was a person who would do&#xD;
nothing on compulsion. -.And when'he fond that such a pow-&#xD;
erful edict had gone forth, that he must be saved, he swore, in&#xD;
his benighted obstinacy, that he would be  .  if he would!&#xD;
This ledi through his spleens to an explanation between him-&#xD;
self and-the business-man of the firm, and what was their mu-&#xD;
tual 'astonishment, on privately comparing "notes," to find that&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN.                20T&#xD;
one was absolutely a "Cherubitn," and the other an " Arch-&#xD;
angel!" They looked at each other with a blank stare of sur-&#xD;
prise. The tawney, lean, angular, iron-jawed face of the busi-&#xD;
ness-man suggested anything but the plump, and dimpled out-&#xD;
lines of that prolific progeny of winged infants, which Raphael&#xD;
has rendered so illustrious. While, in contrast, the features of-&#xD;
the young editor were remarkable for their plump and child-&#xD;
like freshness.&#xD;
4 Why!" shouted the business-man, with a tremendous&#xD;
guffaw, "there's a great mistake here -she 'has clearly mis-&#xD;
directed the notes. You should be the cherib !"&#xD;
The breath of a simultaneous roar of laughter dissipated all&#xD;
her fine-spun web, in these two directions, at least. She was&#xD;
more successful, however, with the third party.&#xD;
Manton had been deceived, egregiously, in regard to this&#xD;
man's past history,-or.he would never have permitted him to&#xD;
pass the threshold of the house where he lived.  He had&#xD;
known him only as- ostensibly associate editor of a highly-&#xD;
respectable paper, and therefore had not felt himself called upon&#xD;
to interfere in any way. Although he had, as we have per-&#xD;
ceived, early indications of his having become a frequent visitor&#xD;
at thehouse.&#xD;
To have gone any higher in her classification of him than she&#xD;
had already gone in that of his associates, would have puzzled&#xD;
any less versatile genius than hers. But. as cherubim and arch-&#xD;
angel had already been used up, she placed- him among the&#xD;
"principalities and powers in heavenly places," and there he&#xD;
decided to stick. It was certainly time for him to be pleased&#xD;
with elevation of some sort, for, as it turned out afterwards,&#xD;
when his history became better understood by Manton, he was&#xD;
one of those slugs, or barnacles of the press, that, cling about&#xD;
and slime the keels of every noble aid thought-freighted bark.&#xD;
From the precarious and eminently honourable occupation of&#xD;
writing obscene books for private circulation, "getting up"&#xD;
quack advertisements, interpolating the pages of rau['De Kock&#xD;

&#xD;
-with smearings of darker filth than ever his mousing vision had&#xD;
yet discovered ,in- the sinks and gutters of Paris, he had gra.&#xD;
dually risen, through his facile availability, to the sub rosa&#xD;
respectability of a well-paid "sub" in a respectable office --.I&#xD;
say sub rosa, for it seems-to have been" well understood, in New&#xD;
York, that the appearance 'of his- name, at- the head of the&#xD;
columns of any paper, would be' sufficient to damn it, outright,&#xD;
so linked had it become with sneaking infamy of every sort.&#xD;
However, this-" dhild of genius" and Madame progressed&#xD;
bravely towards a mutual understanding; 'and billets-doux flew&#xD;
between them thick'as snow-flakes. ,As for their contents, the&#xD;
reader is 'by -this time, pretty well prepared to conjecture. In-&#xD;
terviews, from weekly tosemi-weekly, crowded fast upon each&#xD;
other's heels; until, at last, Manton began to perceive that, not&#xD;
only was the sleeve lost every day, but that the new novel, like&#xD;
the pious labor of the needle of Penelope, "grew with its&#xD;
growth."&#xD;
About this time, however, it came to his knowledge, that this&#xD;
highly respectable literary personage, Mr. Narcissus, had been&#xD;
as notoriously abject in his private relations as he had been in&#xD;
those to the press.' However, as he had. determined to drag&#xD;
Elna from beneath the. clutches of her mother, and to sever all&#xD;
reinote,: or even possible connection between them, he did not&#xD;
feel himself called upon to do more than announce the fact to&#xD;
Madame that the fellow was even now an infamous stipendiary&#xD;
to a party no less infamous tlhan himself, who had privately fur-&#xD;
nished, him, out of her ill-gotten gains,' the money to buy his&#xD;
share in-the weekly paper she was so ambitious of controlling,&#xD;
through him. As he had now 'to expect, she received the news&#xD;
with the most refreshing ycolness, and merely remarked, that it&#xD;
was no fault of hers that this.bad, woman had loved' Mr. Nat-'&#xD;
cissus; that he possessed-great talent in affairs; could be made&#xD;
of much use in, the cause of human progress and advancement&#xD;
--in a word, 'deserved to be: saved, and to save him she meant.&#xD;
{ She should rescue him from such gross and debasing associa-&#xD;

tions, and give to his astonishing energies a nobler bent; 'that&#xD;
his future life; under her inspiration and guidance, should be&#xD;
made to atone for the past.&#xD;
This logic seemed so very conclusive and characteristic, that&#xD;
Manton made no reply, but a shudder,.at the thought of that&#xD;
saving process; to which, despicable as he was,'a new ,victim&#xD;
was to be subjected. But it' was no part of..his ,plan to divert&#xD;
her from her purpose ;. for he wished, by all means, toj see her&#xD;
active and dangerous energies employed in any direction;;save&#xD;
that of the subversion and counteraction of his own design in&#xD;
regard to her daughysafter, was sent to New.England, with the&#xD;
understanding between Manton and herself, that' she would by&#xD;
no means consent to return to -her mother, until he himself&#xD;
should come back from his tour, and should send for her. He&#xD;
did not dare to trust her for an hour' beneath the accursed&#xD;
shadow of this domestic Upas, that had given her birth;,and&#xD;
more particularly did he dread the hideous combination of in-&#xD;
fluences which were likely now to be brought to bear upon'her,&#xD;
as Madam    had openly announced her intention, since she&#xD;
had obtained a divorce from her former husband;,to marry the&#xD;
delectablesNarcissus.&#xD;
dNWe may as. well dispose of this affair at once, by remarking,&#xD;
that in a few months afterward she did marry him; that the un-&#xD;
fortunate woman, who had heretofore so long lived with and&#xD;
loved Narcissus, 'instantly withdrew the support which her ill-&#xD;
gotten gains furnished'; and that, asserting her rightto the-share&#xD;
which he had pretended to own in the property of the paper,&#xD;
and disclosing the whole of his infamy to his former partners,&#xD;
the cherubim and, archangel indignantly.kicked him- out of&#xD;
doors, and at once toppled about the astonished earsof Madame&#xD;
all her castles, in the air reared, with regard to "controlling a&#xD;
powerful organ."&#xD;
But Madarne, as we have perceived, .was possessed of one&#xD;
of those elastic natures which always rebound from collisions,&#xD;

or which, in a word,. U6never say die ;" so that, instead of being&#xD;
discouraged by this untoward conclusion of her ambitious&#xD;
schemes, she-set herself to work forthwith to make the best of a-&#xD;
bad bargain; and, as she had already exhibited. her passion for&#xD;
professional spouses,.in immediately converting her first and&#xD;
dear Ebenezer, into an M. D., she could not do less than make&#xD;
a Doctor o't of her-beloved Narcissus.&#xD;
It did not matter to her that both of them were ludicrously&#xD;
ignorant--that neither of-them had probablyever read a book&#xD;
clear through in their lives; rparchments were dog-cheap in New&#xD;
York, and could be had any day for an equivalent in hard coin.&#xD;
She accordingly "put him through ;" and in something less&#xD;
than three months, one more legalised murderer wjs turned&#xD;
loose upon society, under the cabalistic ogis of M. D.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXJV.&#xD;
REANIMATION.&#xD;
AMIDST the green and savage solitude of pine-haired hills,&#xD;
wild-bounding streams, and islet-fretted lakes, asleep, 'twixt&#xD;
gleam and shadow, -where the bellowing moose still roused the&#xD;
echoes, and the light deer whistled to the brown bear's growl,&#xD;
and-the trout leaped, flashing from its clear, still home, Manton&#xD;
_etiewed his life once more, in refreshing- communion with&#xD;
nature.&#xD;
It was not till now that he realised how terribly he had&#xD;
suffered during his long and hideous bondage. His physical&#xD;
health had been shockingly impaired; the elasticity of his con-&#xD;
stitution seemed to be gone forever ; but it was only in the pre-&#xD;
sence of Nature, with whom there are no disguises,-that he could&#xD;
first comprehend, in all its ghastliness, the mental and spiritual&#xD;
deterioration that had gradually supervened. 'He scarcely knew&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
himself, now that, he had found-his way back to the only stan-&#xD;
dard :of comparison.  He was profoundly humiliated, but not&#xD;
utterly despairing.&#xD;
He.felt his chest already beginning to play more freely, and&#xD;
a deadly sense, as if a thousand years of suffocating oppression&#xD;
had lain upon his lungs, was beginning to be dissipated before the&#xD;
pure air of the mountains, and the exciting pre-occupations of&#xD;
angling and the chase, in the rough wilderness-life he now led;&#xD;
and beside,-there was the image of that wizard child, that had&#xD;
so grown in beauty beneath his hand,~that- sat forever in his&#xD;
heart, glowing and, fair, to warm 'it with a new life of hope.&#xD;
How studiously his fancy exalted her. Each fortnight brought&#xD;
him a package  of her daily letters; and though in spite of his&#xD;
isolation; and his idealising enthusiasm, as he eagerly read and&#xD;
re-read them all a thousand times, and' carried them near his&#xD;
heart, to keep the glow there all alive, he could not help&#xD;
realising at times, with mournful presentiment, their hollowness,&#xD;
the entire absence of ingenuousness and natural dignity which&#xD;
mostly characterised them. He would feel his flesh creep&#xD;
strangely too, as he recognised their close resemblance in aiti-&#xD;
ficiality of sentiment and tone,-to those first letters he had ,re-&#xD;
ceived from her mother.&#xD;
Buthe earnestly strove to banish"'all such impressions; he felt&#xD;
as if they were pofane, as if they'were a monstrous wrong to&#xD;
her, as well as to himself. That she was too young -as yet to&#xD;
have:developed into the full faculty of expression; that she was&#xD;
timid, and dared not trust herself to- speak freely out; that she&#xD;
feared his sharp criticism, and did not say everything that her&#xD;
soul moved her to speak; that she dreaded his analysis; and, in&#xD;
a word,' had not quite overcome, in -her. feelings towards him,&#xD;
the instinctive apprehension of the master, 'the preceptor, which&#xD;
so long lingers in a youthful mind.; and'this very timidity, of&#xD;
all things, he was desirous of removing, as he felt that, so long&#xD;
as it remained in her mind, the full and entire reciprocation of&#xD;
confidence, which the jealous exclusiveness of passion de-&#xD;

&#xD;
hands, could not take place.  He felt that it was a most&#xD;
hazardous experiment he had been unconsciously makin&#xD;
thus attempting to develope and educate a 'wife, especially under&#xD;
circumstances so unusual and ill-omened. He therefore fatally&#xD;
persisted in. blaming himself for.the-.self-evident shallowness of1&#xD;
Rlna's letters; and would not hear to the whispers of his con-&#xD;
non sense, that the chitd, was a mere chip of the old block.&#xD;
So that still, in spite of his determined idealisation of her,&#xD;
e these evidences stared him in. the face with. each new,&#xD;
yearned-for,.and eagerly-welcomed budget of letters from her,&#xD;
they enly servd to fill him, to a more sensitive degree, with the&#xD;
dangers of this excessive timidity, and the necessity of greater&#xD;
spiritual activity and tenderness of treatment on his part that&#xD;
might arouse her to a more full realisation of the sacred confi-'&#xD;
dences which- love implies. His letters to her overflowed with&#xD;
natural eloquence ; and all that was chastening, ennoblin fair&#xD;
and pure, in the inspirations surrounding him, were lavished in&#xD;
the prodigality of an absorbing and overflowing affection Upon&#xD;
this fair, hollow idol, that his passion alone had rendered all&#xD;
divine.&#xD;
Tliis brooding,, constantly and long, upon a sinle image,&#xD;
amidst the solemn privacies, the wild and' dear soleinnities of&#xD;
primeyal nature, was quite sufficient to give, intime, to an na-.&#xD;
ture possessing the intensity of that of Mantoi, a sultry tinge&#xD;
of monomania1, in reference to it- This was clearly the case&#xD;
with him now. Her image, glorified through ,his imagination,&#xD;
now killedd all his lice; he saw her everywhere--where the beau-&#xD;
tifu might be, it took some shade of semblance to her--where&#xD;
the d wers gave outtheir-odors to the breeze, it was to him&#xD;
tearoma ofher presence-; when the wild berry tingled his&#xD;
palate in a nameless, ecstacy of flavor, the taste was of his sense&#xD;
of her, when, in their last kiss, her 'lips were touched to.his..&#xD;
But it'isa strange thing that, with all the fervor of this pas-&#xD;
sional attraction, "e never dreamed of her at all; she never,&#xD;
came tohis soul when his senses were asleep. This single fact&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN.&#xD;
&#xD;
218&#xD;
&#xD;
might have warned 'a man of imagination less 'excited than&#xD;
Manton. This happy delusion had at least one good effect, as&#xD;
it enabled him, by a single effort, to throwoff all his dangerous&#xD;
habits, and return from his tour, to New York, with a 'freshened&#xD;
and invigorated frame, and a soul chastened indeed, but 'filled&#xD;
with wild and eager hopes of the golden-hued Utopia he had&#xD;
framed out in the wilderness.&#xD;
Elna had returned and met him. . Alas-! how his heart sank,&#xD;
as, on the meeting, he felt the rainbow-hues all melting from&#xD;
out the visionary sky, and he took into his arms a cold, overact-&#xD;
ing, artificial semblance of his passionate ideal! He felt as if&#xD;
the sky had turned to lead, and- 'fallen oW him; and the first&#xD;
image recalled to his mind, was-of the sick and monkey-imp,&#xD;
souliess and animal-eyed, that he had years ago rescued, in&#xD;
compassion, from the demon-talons' of the mother. He clutched&#xD;
her desperately to his heart, endeavoring to recall the soul he&#xD;
misses, and that she had lost, while he had been away. HA&#xD;
felt as if there were fire enough' in his own veinsito make a soul&#xD;
-to fill that delicate and graceful organisation with a subtler&#xD;
element, that might answer to the ravin, of his sympathies.&#xD;
No such response as he yearned for came; but he felt in-&#xD;
stantly , from the contact of her hand, that fierce and sultry&#xD;
thrill, the memory of which had lingered so long with him,&#xD;
tinging his imagination with a lurid light amidst the white clear&#xD;
calm of nature's inspirations. He would not give up now ; he&#xD;
had loved too long already-or, rather, the habit of confounding&#xD;
passion with love, had become too confirmed with him, for it to&#xD;
be readily possible that he should make the clear distintion be-&#xD;
tween images nurtured in his own-mind and the objective real-&#xD;
ity. It was his own mistake ; he had expected too much of the'&#xD;
child--ihe must'give her time to gain confidence and speak out&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
Infatuated mai!' She only wanted. a few hours' contact to&#xD;
speak out himself to himself, through the Odic medium!&#xD;
And so it proved. Her organisation soon took the key-note&#xD;
&#xD;

from his, and, in a few :hours, responded as rapturously as he&#xD;
could desire, to the inost vehement expressions of his enthu-&#xD;
siasn.&#xD;
First. and foremost, she showed to him the drawings that she&#xD;
had raade- during-their long probation. Among them were&#xD;
some so characterised by a firm,. exquisite ,delicacy of hand.&#xD;
ling, that Mariton regarded them with delighted wonder;-ore&#xD;
especially as the defect in EIna's pencilling, which he had always&#xD;
noticed and lamented, had been precisely contrasted with the&#xD;
excellences here displayed.. .EIna's had, with all its gay and&#xD;
mocking eccentricity, always been trembling and uncertain.&#xD;
The want of smooth, and poised,,directness in .her harsh, rude&#xD;
handling, had often been contrasted by him in his lessons to her,&#xD;
upon art, with the clear, firm, and mathematical precision of the&#xD;
lines of Moione. He- could not. but exclaim impulsively, on&#xD;
examining them. curiously-=&#xD;
"Why, dearest, you-have equalled the brightest excellence of&#xD;
the style of Moione in these. Ah, how I love you for this ! you&#xD;
are deserving of all that. I have dreamed and thought and felt&#xD;
of you, since I have been away."&#xD;
The blushing girl slid into his embrace; and that moment was&#xD;
to Manton a sufficient compensation for all the self-degradation&#xD;
and the .humiliating conditions through which he had passed.&#xD;
He was now to attain the coveted crown and glory of his life&#xD;
as he conceived. An artist-wife ! Capable, inspired, true, and&#xD;
a "help-mate" indeed, through whose assistance and tutored&#xD;
skill lie night embody in realisation those. fleeting and majestic&#xD;
creations which visited him, not alone in dreams, but in the real&#xD;
impersonations of his habitual thought. It had been a dreary&#xD;
of such chate beanty,-that :all these visionary forms might be&#xD;
transfigured to him in the alembic of art, through love, and be-&#xD;
come, in form and color, fireside realities of the canvass...&#xD;
We shall see how vague and empty was this fanciful dream,&#xD;
as yet.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV&#xD;
THE SEPARATION.&#xD;
HAD it ever occurred to Manton to reason at all upon the&#xD;
subject of his passion for this girl Elna, or had it been possible&#xD;
for him, under the: circumstances which had lately surrounded&#xD;
his life, to reason concerning her, in any sense, he must and&#xD;
would have felt howrominous such a passion in reality was. To&#xD;
be sure, he did not feel that the. relations into which it had been&#xD;
attempted to drag him by the mother, had ever been voluntary&#xD;
or accepted on his part; he had loathed and rebelled against&#xD;
them from the. first.&#xD;
But this did not, in reality, niake the fact of his having con-&#xD;
tinued near her-to -occupy the same house-any the less offend.&#xD;
sive to the moralsense ; for, taking the best aspects of the case,&#xD;
the durance had not been a physical one, and he-might, if he&#xD;
had so willed, have walked himself bodily off, and thus escaped&#xD;
this horrible entanglement ; but he had not done so. Although&#xD;
we have endeavored, as some etenuation, to trace the reasons&#xD;
ihy he had not thus acted, yet we have found  no excuse suffi-&#xD;
cient, in all this, for the new sin he has committed,-in daring to&#xD;
love, and contemplating honorable marriage, even, with-the&#xD;
daughter of such a mother. But we have naught to extenuate,&#xD;
naught to set down in malice, in this too fatally true narrative;&#xD;
we have related it because it is true, and because we felt it to&#xD;
be our duty to do so, that. others might be warned. of these&#xD;
things,'which may, perhaps, enlighten the reader somewhat, as&#xD;
to the character of the new thraldom to which Manton has been&#xD;
subjected.&#xD;
It must always be borne in mind, in speaking of Manton and&#xD;
measuring his actions, that although the nervous sanguine tem-&#xD;

peratment predominated to an extraordinary degree in this man's&#xD;
organisation, the tendencies of his mind were, nevertheless,, un-&#xD;
usually conservative, This rendered him, necessarily, a man&#xD;
of habits; and therefore, more than usually liable-to suffer from&#xD;
gradual and constant encroachment t for, if his quick'sense has&#xD;
not instantly det~eted the danger on its first presentation-if his&#xD;
ear has not }recognised the serpent's hiss at once, among the&#xD;
flowers; hisfearless hand would ,soon be caressing. the shining&#xD;
reptile, and .bear' if, it might- be, even to his own bosom. It&#xD;
was this tenacity of habits which had rendered him so. easy to&#xD;
be imposed upon.' Nothing was- so. difficult for him to. throw&#xD;
off as- a 'habit; for, from the intensity of his nature,it always&#xD;
cost himtthe- suffering of a strong excitement before its chains&#xD;
could be broken.       '&#xD;
Manton found, very soon, after his return, that what he most&#xD;
dreaded now, was to bey at once precipitated, which was a sepa-&#xD;
ration between himself and Elna. .Not that -he did not fully&#xD;
concede to the general propriety and prudence of such a step;&#xD;
for he; remembered that he had at once proposed. the previous'&#xD;
separation, when, he came to understand the nature of hisfeel-&#xD;
ings towards her ; but that- had been when she was to be placed&#xD;
beyond the reach of her mother, and they could be both out of&#xD;
town at the 'same time ; but now that his-business made' it im-&#xD;
perative - for him to remain in New York, if he dreaded before&#xD;
lest she be left with the mother one day. even, were not the same&#xD;
causes operating still, and with redoubled force, when, in addi-&#xD;
tion _to her -baleful contact, he had to .contemplate that of the&#xD;
creature she had married,?-&#xD;
The'moral and spiritual' grime of such a contact was enough&#xD;
'to blast an angel's -bloom  to sully, the purest wing that ever&#xD;
winnowed dream. He must be there to shield his fair treasure&#xD;
always, till the time had come when. he could snatch her for&#xD;
ever beyond their reach. But the war had now fairly opened.&#xD;
On the very day of' his return, Mantonhad been not a little&#xD;
astonished to find the heretofore abject and 'cringing otherr turn&#xD;

upon him, suddenly, with a lofty insolence, that seemed at first&#xD;
incredible ; but his surprise .and anger rapidly gave way to&#xD;
wonder and stunned amaze, at finding her exhibiting the most&#xD;
unparalleled phenomena of brazen, grave, deliberate falsehood&#xD;
that ever still imagination, in bottomless conceit, had conjured&#xD;
as the thought of demons in dark hell. - This was yet, strange&#xD;
as it mayseem, a most terrible realisation to have .come upon&#xD;
his life ; though he- had, up to this time, known that she was&#xD;
unscrupulous, as far as the attainment of influential connexions,&#xD;
for the dissemination of her theoretical views, was concerned -&#xD;
that she was, in this respect, a dangerous and an evil woman-&#xD;
that her influence would make her presence deadly to purity, in&#xD;
her own or the other sex; yet, he had not learned to regard her&#xD;
as utterly God-forsaken. The veil was now lifted. The scales&#xD;
that had ,remained fell forever from his eyes. 'Shei now stood&#xD;
revealed, not as he had heretofore striven to palliate his convic-&#xD;
tions concerning her -the ferocious fanatic of one idea  the&#xD;
cunning and detestable Jesuit of a "A cause"--but 'as the&#xD;
incarnation of, unnatural passions and a demonised selfishness&#xD;
He trembled to his heart's core at the thought of that fair young&#xD;
girl, whom he had learned to love, being left to the tender mer-&#xD;
cies of a monster such as this. He saw at once the whole nefa-&#xD;
rious scheme that had been concocted between herself and her&#xD;
worthy coadjutor.&#xD;
This was but the initial step. This precipitation of a quarrel&#xD;
with himself, which would~ bring about at least a partial&#xD;
separation with Elna, and then their subsequent game would&#xD;
slowly ands surely accomplish the rest. Was it likely that a&#xD;
wretch like this pink of 'Adelicacy, Narcissus, who had be-&#xD;
fore, for years, been steeped to 'lips in that monstrous traffic&#xD;
the sale of bodies as well as  , would quietly permit to slip&#xD;
through  s fingers a lovely and fascinating girl as Elna had now&#xD;
grow    -P e, over wig's value, in dollars and cents, he had&#xD;

who had eil y learned to appreciate the convenience of such&#xD;

speculations, would not fully coincide with him in his view of&#xD;
the policy of defeating 'Manton, who,' in the event of success,&#xD;
woeld be sure to separate, her from them as far as the poles are&#xD;
sundered ?&#xD;
We shall now see how-far the young lady herself' was likely&#xD;
to, -or had already, become a party to such utilitarian views.&#xD;
Manton had left the house, and 'taken board elsewhere. The&#xD;
same evening, he visited Elna, who.received him alone in the&#xD;
warm, well-lighted , .and neatly-arranged parlor. :Manton had&#xD;
come in the most hopeless mood, for all the results of this sepa-&#xD;
ration had been most fully and painfully impressed. upon him&#xD;
since the first indication of the rupture that had led to his quit-&#xD;
ting the house.'&#xD;
The, young girl sprang eagerly to meet - him, and with a&#xD;
bounding caress clasped his neck, exclaiming&#xD;
"Dearest one, you must not look so sad ! We are to have&#xD;
the parlor thus every evening, when you, shall come to see me ;&#xD;
when we shall be very stately and proper folk. I shall play the&#xD;
dignified matron in anticipation, and you shall be my very wise&#xD;
and solemn lord and master. . Mother is not to permit any&#xD;
interruption, and, we shall have such nice and easy times.&#xD;
Come, sit down here by my side, -and let us begin to play&#xD;
stately. And clear up that gloomy brow of yours,'for I am' de-.&#xD;
termined that 'we shall be happy !"&#xD;
Manton could only smile faintly, as he seated himself.&#xD;
"Ah, heedless child, you do not see in all this gay vision, the&#xD;
black and" deadly realities that. couch within its shadows!. I&#xD;
understand your mother's game fully.- This will note last long;&#xD;
and you are about to. be sorely' tried, my little love !n'&#xD;
His head fell back heavily,  his eyelids drooped with an&#xD;
expression' of unutterable des . dency. Elna, who had been&#xD;
watching hinr eagerly," now flew to his, side, and taking his.&#xD;
head gently on her shoulder,. commenced caressing  is face-&#xD;
in a- peculiar manner. She did not absohluty tou'it,. but'&#xD;
her lips crept over certain portions with a slow snale-like mo-&#xD;

tion, while the deep 'heavings of her. chest, disclosed that "she&#xD;
was breathing heavily upon them, and a certain greenish dilation&#xD;
of the pupil of her eyes revealed--what ? . Ah, horror! and she&#xD;
so young! 'What? what ! is, that the mother's art ? Let us see.&#xD;
The lines of the man's face are sunken in the expression of&#xD;
hopeless prostration. Soonra slight twitching of the'nerves be-&#xD;
comes evident, then a faint smile breaks across its pallor; the&#xD;
inspirations become deeper, and she breathes with almostaon&#xD;
vulsive energy. The glowing air lingers and burns along -the&#xD;
sensitive' temple, and now it pauses on the cheek, close beside&#xD;
the ear-ha ! her arm is about his neck ; is it a wonder that the&#xD;
blood mounts flushing to that man's cheek and forehead, that&#xD;
his eyes fly open filled with wild and vivid fires, that a shudder-&#xD;
ing thrill is. running through his frame, as he stretches forth his&#xD;
arms to her, with a low, ecstatic laugh, of passionate yearning,&#xD;
while she clings about him, and their lips meet, in a burning,&#xD;
lingering kiss, and then, with a'-light laugh, she springs beyond&#xD;
his reach, and dances in tantalising mockery about him, per-&#xD;
mitting hie 'but to touch her for a moment, eluding-his grasp,&#xD;
with yet more subtle sleight, until exhausted by morbid excite-&#xD;
ment the unfortunate man sinks upon the sofa?&#xD;
This picture is only, but too real. But why should Manton&#xD;
have endured the repetition of a scene like this? He was.a man&#xD;
of habits, and for years, before a thought of passion had for&#xD;
once intruded upon him, this young girl, under the sacred shield&#xD;
of childhood, had been taught to approach him with fondling&#xD;
caresses. There seemed no danger then, but when the real&#xD;
time for danger came, he felt a vague and general 'monition of&#xD;
it, yet failed to locate it where it really rested. These caresses&#xD;
had become so- dear and 'natural to him; they seemed so&#xD;
harmless.&#xD;
He blamed only himself,. cursed only the unetherialised gross-&#xD;
ness of his own nature. There was to him far too much of&#xD;
affection and accustomed tenderness in all this to arouse his sus-&#xD;
picions for a moment. He hated 'only himself, and strove oni&#xD;

We will not dwell upon} such 'pictures farther. It was enough&#xD;
that all the consequences dreaded'by Manfon followed,.in slow,&#xD;
but sure' progression, and that the, last blow the subtle couple&#xD;
struck at him -wasfully characteristic and consummated the&#xD;
separation.&#xD;
Elna had seen- little, as yet, of public amusements, and her&#xD;
strongimitative faculty had led her to-express. a passion 'for the&#xD;
stage,'which Manton greatly 'dreaded, "and had' particularly&#xD;
wished .to guard her against, Until her mind should become more&#xD;
fully developed, and until he, himself, should possess the legal&#xD;
right to attend her, upon 'all such occasions. He hadtherefore&#xD;
at all times resolutely opposed heroin g to any publ, place&#xD;

Here the enterprising couple saw at once their advantage;&#xD;
the mother understood what Menton did not, the extreme shal-&#xD;
lowness of the character he had 'thus perseveringly idealised.&#xD;
She at once laid siege to her passion' for dress and display, as&#xD;
well as novelty.' They bought her fine and showy clothes, and&#xD;
urged her first. to accompany them to concerts, then to theatres,&#xD;
and then to public ball-s.&#xD;
When the young girl first came to Manton, all pushed with&#xD;
'eagerness, to show him her finery, and 'ask him if she might not&#xD;

notorious as this, whom she had thus, suddenly, learned to style&#xD;
"papa."?&#xD;
Rut he soon found it to be all in vain.; for, when he-told her&#xD;
if she would only be content to wait a few weeks until his book&#xD;
had been published, that he would himself dedicate any amount&#xD;
of time she might require to visiting such places with her-she&#xD;
still urged that she did-snot see why it was improper for her to&#xD;
accompany the man whom her mother had '.nharried; to any&#xD;
public place-that her new dresses were so beautiful-that she&#xD;
wished to attend this magnificent concert.&#xD;
Manton sighed heavily and only answered in 'a mournful&#xD;
voice to her repeated entreaties---&#xD;
"Alas ! poor child,' 'my dream is; nearly over!\ I see they&#xD;
have bought you' with the tinsel of a fine dress and new ribbons!"&#xD;
The child wept and fondled and caressed; but' all her arts&#xD;
failed this time. His heart felt like lead within him; and he no&#xD;
longer had nerves with life enough to be played upon.- But she&#xD;
went that night, nevertheless, and the great- gulf had sunk im-&#xD;
passably between them.&#xD;
Manton was now again a madman. In the pride of his hope-&#xD;

energies had rapidly placed upon the firm basis of realisation;&#xD;
it only required the calm exercise of his own will to 'conisum-&#xD;

for himself-and she, for whom all had been achieved, ,was no&#xD;

DESPAIR.&#xD;
" The white feet of angels yet' upon the hills."&#xD;
MONTHs and months- had passed, and yet this wretched man&#xD;
was staggering on, not this time drunk, literally, but, as though&#xD;
blinded by red blood, oozing from his brain, which had been&#xD;
crushed by the weight of this blow. He was wandering vaguely&#xD;
hither and yon, distracting his brain in ineffectual chimeras, the&#xD;
very impossibilities of their success affording to him their greatest&#xD;
attraction. But gradually all this maddened struggle had been&#xD;
settling, down into one sultry, close, inevitable conclusion of&#xD;
sullen self-destruction, -which must. result from the continued&#xD;
precipitation, upon conditions. that promised death in-one form&#xD;
or.other. He went to Boston while- the cholera was raging&#xD;
there at its worst. The pretence of the visit, was some wild, dis-&#xD;
tracting scheme that he had seized upon, and in-which he was&#xD;
endeavoring to secure co-operation there.&#xD;
But unfo unately for his mad' purpose, since -that very sepa- -&#xD;
ration from daily contact with the irl Elna, which was working&#xD;
so sadly iupon his imagination nowt his attenuated and exhausted&#xD;
physique had rapidly recovered all its inherent vigor, and' in&#xD;
animal health and strength he had suddenly become, by an inex-&#xD;
plicable reaction, mor-e prodigally abounding than ever for many&#xD;
years. So that fate seemed to have closed up to'him'.any ordi-&#xD;
nary means of getting rid of himself, except the pistol and the&#xD;
dagger, from the use of which his manliness unoenquerably&#xD;
revolted.&#xD;
But by a strange process of self-delusion, he had managed to&#xD;
confouid himself into the idea that the abject cowardice of tie&#xD;
act of suicide might be avoided by a species of half uncnscious&#xD;
indirection. For instance cholera was rife -in the city, anc he&#xD;

well knew that long warm baths, by relaxing the ,system, would&#xD;
lay it more open'to the attacks.of any epidemical tendencies that.&#xD;
might be prevalent; and accordingly, without ever venturing to&#xD;
explain to himself why, he continued, day after day, to take these&#xD;
long hot baths -and then to eat and drink, in the quietest possi-&#xD;
ble way, everything that Was specially to be avoided at such a&#xD;
time.-&#xD;
While this novel process was thus coolly progressing, he one&#xD;
morning met, by the merest accident,-on State Street,' a person&#xD;
whom he knew to have been long and intimately the friend-of&#xD;
the lost. Moione aid her -family. .1Vanton eagerly asked him&#xD;
if he knew where she could now be found;^'for,.strange enough,&#xD;
her calm image had lately intruded often into the darkened&#xD;
vistas of bis.thought, from whence -he had supposed her ban-,&#xD;
ished long ago.&#xD;
+ler address was promptly given: it was in a remote and&#xD;
humble district of'. the city ; and, although Manton already felt&#xD;
the seeds of the disease, which he had - thus pertinaciouslyin-&#xD;
vited, rioting within him, yet he vowed to himself that he would&#xD;
at once seek her. His first visit failed.; but the second found&#xD;
her, thin and wan, stretched on 'a lounge, awaiting she knew&#xD;
not whom..&#xD;
With a, short cry of sudden joy, as she recognised his fea-&#xD;
tures, she sprang -to meet him, as, of old, with a child caress.&#xD;
Ah, why was it that he felt such. sullen cold, and yet sawlight,&#xD;
falling like, star-beams upon .the midnight of his soul, as his&#xD;
arm,s met this fond, and.childishsclasp.? He did not understand&#xD;
it --but we shall see!.&#xD;
The physical results, which 'he had so assiduously courted,&#xD;
could not be 'avoided. As. he had walked about among his&#xD;
friends already for several days, with the premonitory symptoms&#xD;
of the fatal epidemic fully developed in his system, and as fully&#xD;
understood by.hihnself, yet without the adoption, on his own,&#xD;
part, of one single precautionary step, it was now sure to wreak&#xD;
its worst Soxie, who. could udt help observing his ghastly ap- -&#xD;

Regardless of every remonstrance, he still kept his feet, until,&#xD;
at length, the third evening found :him leaving his hotel, in a,&#xD;
hank, which he ordered to be driven,.to the home of Moione ;&#xD;
and from which he. had to be carried, by the' driver, into the&#xD;
parlor, where 'he sank upon what he supposed to be the last&#xD;
couch upon which he should recline in life. A strange, inde-&#xD;
structible feeling, that he must die beneath her eye,-had urged&#xD;
him to this last and desperate exertion of the feeble vitality re-&#xD;
maining in him. He had lain himself there to die ; but why,&#xD;
the strange purpose that shoe should -minister to his passing&#xD;
breath? Was it only here that peace could be found for hin?,&#xD;

been detained by the illness of a friend, joined with the incle-&#xD;

Manton; and the black fear of the night outside only corre-&#xD;
sponded to the convulsed' and,, writhing agonies which now&#xD;
tossed him to and fro, in helpless, but most, mortal agonies.&#xD;
The thunder' crashed, and the frail house shook, and the fierce&#xD;
pangs shot along his quivering nerves, as vividly as any blinding&#xD;
burst of lightning' from without.  The 'darkness' which sur-&#xD;
rounded hiim had been penetrated 'by a" calm, pure light, that&#xD;
dimmed not nor trembled before the blinding blast. A voice,&#xD;
the soft, clear, cheerful tones of 'which vibrated not to ,the&#xD;
quick rattling of thunder-crashes' from without, told'him. of&#xD;
strength and hope, of peace and a calm future, in. the life yet&#xD;
beyond him on the earth-that he could not die now,,and should&#xD;
not !-until his will b came elecirified with a new impulsion, and&#xD;

realms of shadow   dark and deep -he had lain .in long and&#xD;
dunb oblivion of consciousness. He knew not that he lived;&#xD;
it was a blank' of rayless rest-a peace without sunshine. low&#xD;
profound ! how ununtterably still!' What a contrast with the&#xD;
ceaseless, dreadful tesion. of the moiling chaos of past years,&#xD;
during which the ,passions had never slept,, but, through his very&#xD;
dreams, had. moaned in the weariness of strife. Alas! the re-&#xD;
bellious heart, which struggletjh in' unyielding pride with life,&#xD;
refusing to concede to its conditions, how it must -suffer? The&#xD;
World, know little of the life-long horrors of that'fight.-.'the un-&#xD;
idealizing world, the conservative, the compromising world. It&#xD;
little dreams' what this self-immolating madman must endure a&#xD;
to what nights of sleepless' thought, to what days of bleak and&#xD;
sullen isolation-walking apart.from sympathies that are dis-&#xD;
trusted and scorned, yet yearned for-hating nothing, yet loving&#xD;
nothing which is warmed in the embrace of earth, because that&#xD;
earth -may be accursed in hissight: its barren bosom' has not&#xD;
yielded to his exacting soul the flowers and streams and echo..&#xD;
ing groves of 'the' Utopia it has framed within him.&#xD;
This isthe unpardonable' sin of pride! He dares to 'treat&#xD;
~wth contempt a ,world that will not. turn to his inspired voice,&#xD;
&#xD;
P                             ,   ,&#xD;
l&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
and live as he has dreamed it might live. It is not to be won-&#xD;
dered at, that the bolts fall thick and fast about him; but when&#xD;
we see his pale brow scathed and seamed withmany a stunning&#xD;
stroke, while his-- hollow eyes yet glitter with, a 'deathless and&#xD;
defiant fire-when we think of, the mortal tension of his unsyn-&#xD;
pathised life - oh, should we not remember, that this. painful&#xD;
warrior has been battling, not for base lucre, not for selfish ends,&#xD;
but for the beautiful, as it has been revealed to'-him-the true,&#xD;
as he has felt it - for the ideal in him; and that, though&#xD;
wretched and suffering and wan, it is, after all,&#xD;
"Of such stuff as he,&#xD;
The gods are .made."&#xD;
It is of his suffering that his prowess comes-of his experiences,&#xD;
his themes-of his solitude, his reach and radiance of thought-,&#xD;
of his strong will, 'his conquering flight at last. Do not think to&#xD;
pity him; may-be he is pitying you.. Do-not attempt to "sate"&#xD;
him ; it may be, it is you who will be damned in the effort.&#xD;
Only let him alone-do not persecute, him. Let his pride pass--&#xD;
that is what sustains him;' but for that, he would be like you, a&#xD;
mere "compromise." ; Give him the same chance that you&#xD;
give to others around you, and,' although you may -not under-&#xD;
stand him .now, only give him time, he will make you under-&#xD;
stand him; it may be, in wonder and in joy.&#xD;
But this waking-but this waking of the weary man! Was&#xD;
it a 'new birth--a new resurrection-or, a mere waking from&#xD;
a light sleep, without a dream? The world upon  which his&#xD;
shrinking vision now opened was filled with sunshine -,he was&#xD;
blinded with the glory thereof. He closed his thin eyelids, and&#xD;
the splendor came through them, all rosy-hued. and dimmed,&#xD;
that he could bear it; but there was a starlight for him too,&#xD;
and her could bear its calm effulgene better.&#xD;
Yes, there were two stars, and'they were tempered, that they&#xD;
might neither freeze nor slay his ,feeble life. When they came&#xD;
over him, as he lay in a half-trance of weakness, he could feel&#xD;

them through- his -eyelids and upon', his heart; 'and they were.&#xD;
warm, and he felt, his heart 'warm, as buds to the unfolding&#xD;
spring. - A dim-remembered music flowed" into his soul, faint&#xD;
and dim, but oh, sweetly mellowed, that he might not die ! .&#xD;
There was :a rustling, top,-it was as of a tempered wind,--.&#xD;
and a soft touch; it sent no thrill, but it was of healing-it sunk&#xD;
into his life in strength. A strange, balsamic tenderness, like a&#xD;
new sense of peace and joy, pervaded all his being-and a new&#xD;
growth set in apace, and a 'dim remembrance of ancient strength.&#xD;
flitted into his' thought.&#xD;
Ah, ha! this wondrous presence, what was it? Moione, the&#xD;
ministei-ing -Moione ! It was she! 'Ever there, sleeping and&#xD;
awake, she leaned over him. When he dreamed, he dreamed&#xD;
of a fair spirit, that hung upon the air above him, on viewless&#xD;
wings, and ever, with still eyes looking upon his, shedding their&#xD;
soft radiance deep into his -soul. No wonder that life,-in swift,&#xD;
light waves, came flooding in again; no wonder that the crushed&#xD;
and much-enduring man became as a child once more, and&#xD;
laughed out in the ,sunshine with a simple joy. The Present&#xD;
was .sufficient unto him; he remembered not the Past now-the&#xD;
hideous, the spectre-haunted Past. What was~it to him,, when&#xD;
serene hope thus smiled ? Ah, it was 'a happy time, that period&#xD;
of rapid -convalescence.. Yes, rapid, for his heart beat freely&#xD;
again. The natural sun could reach him; no lurid delusion, like&#xD;
miasmlatic fog,- hung over to intercept the rays.&#xD;
4 They talked of the future, and peopled it with wild dreams,&#xD;
like children; until 'it all became as real to them ,as their own&#xD;
being. .&#xD;
There was a strange and mournful romance, connected with&#xD;
the or in of'oione's family, that pointed at possible realiza-&#xD;
tionsin another country, through inheritance, that would be' as&#xD;
gorgeous 'as the creations of Aladdin's lamp. They talked of&#xD;
these prospects as of facts. assumed, ,and of all the high-&#xD;
thoughted enterprises of the day which promised to be of true&#xD;
benefit to mankind, as already 'achieved, through their aid; and,&#xD;

with magnanimous simplicity, were already distributing hoarded&#xD;
and rusting millions to ,bless the world withal.  These were&#xD;
gay daydreams; but they were innocent, and, Ilthough they&#xD;
may never be realized, they gave them joy -inspired the yet&#xD;
feeble Manton with a future.&#xD;
There could.be but one result to all-this. His health was&#xD;
rapidly restored; and when Manton married Moione, which he&#xD;
soon did, his soul now first -found rest. ,The' last that was&#xD;
spoken between them concerningElna was in a, conversation&#xD;
soon after,'when she.casually 'asked him-&#xD;
"Did Elna -show'you my drawings, when you came back&#xD;
from the 'North?"&#xD;
"Your drawings? your drawings? She showed me some,&#xD;
the delicacy and calm precision of which, I remember, 'vainly&#xD;
intoxicated: me with delight. - But why do you ask,'dear ?"_&#xD;
"Why, she. carried off from me,' about .that time, certain&#xD;
studies of human anatorpy, which I had elaborated much, and&#xD;
which I valued. As I4have never been ably to recover them,&#xD;
after repeatedlyerequesting 'their return, I thought, perhaps, she&#xD;
might have shown-thein to you, and then thrown them aside,&#xD;
through forgetfulness."'&#xD;
"Ah! hal" said Manton, "I remember now.. They were&#xD;
assiduously paraded' before me by her as her own. In spite&#xD;
of my rec gnition of the fact, that she did not possess originally'&#xD;
and must-have very suddenly acquired, the constitutional steadi-&#xD;
ness and delicacy of touth'necessary to accomplish drawings so&#xD;
fine and exquisitely accurate, I never dreamed.,of imposition, of&#xD;
course; 'and thus, with 'fatal credulity,.set down to her credit,&#xD;
from what she had stolen of 'you, a new and .infinitely signifi-&#xD;
cant attribute, which I had heretofore,-speciallyand hopelessly,&#xD;
in spite of, my passion, denied to her."&#xD;
"Let us forget-it now," was the quiet response. "She is&#xD;
only harmful to either of us, as you ,mayiremember morbidly&#xD;
the' relations which have existed  between you; the delusion is&#xD;
over "&#xD;

artist-wife, and a true and wondrous artist did she prove indeed,&#xD;
realising 'his fond, high' dreatp. Uhider this blessed - and holy&#xD;

existence . He now saw, felt, and understood all that had oc-&#xD;
urred in thtlong shuddering dream; and this-rsality he had&#xD;
attained seeed only the more unutterably precious.&#xD;
When the calm Mojone revealed to him all the secret of the&#xD;
bleak and poverty-stricken desolation, in which he found her&#xD;
living, he was not at all astonished to find- that her mother, who&#xD;
was a generous, trusting, noble-hearted zealot' of Water-cure,&#xD;
had been another of the many victims of Boanerges Phospher,&#xD;
the "Spiritual'Professor."  He h'd not o9xly stripped her wid-&#xD;
owed isdlationof'all the appliances of-household comfort,' which&#xD;
years, of' devoted and selflsacrificing labor had enabled her to&#xD;
collect and' throw together, ;in respectable defence.between her&#xD;
helpless children and common:want, but had absolutely turned&#xD;
her out of 'doors, without even; spoon, or knife, or fork left her,&#xD;
of all this little property which she had'thrown .in rashly, per-&#xD;
haps, but earnestly arind with a noble dedication of .her widow's&#xD;
mite, towards'furnisliing a Water-cure establishment.&#xD;
The cause was' one that she revered for the good that she&#xD;
knew, ractially, it might accomplish; and Boanerges, who&#xD;
wasin this case,as usual, profoundly ignorant of what he had&#xD;
undertaken to 'o, had availed himself of her well-known expe-&#xD;
rence and knowledge of Water-cure, just so long as-sufficed to&#xD;
collect around him again a hirsute confederacy of -faithful 4ma-&#xD;
zons; the strength of ofwhich he thought would be sufficient to&#xD;
oer-ride'all opposition, and sustain him in the 'valorous'assault&#xD;
upon helpless widowhood intended. He then openly claimed&#xD;
her property as his'own, and the 'proud, uncomplaining mother&#xD;
of Moio e was, of course, plundered of- her iall---victimised!&#xD;

C1IAPTJER      XXVII.&#xD;
THE SECRET COTCLAVE.'n&#xD;
THE Editor finds that here--the connected narrative of Ethe-&#xD;
rial 'Softdown breaks off. Though there are many fragmentary&#xD;
notes, which he found in Yieger's Cabinet, which bear a clear,&#xD;
yet somewhat disconnected relation, to the past and future of&#xD;
the scenes, and actors already described ; these he has thought&#xD;
proper to collate, and throw together into something as nearly'&#xD;
approaching order as their desultory character will permit.&#xD;
This -man Yieger, seems to have been an enthusiast of a very&#xD;
unusual stamp. He has, however, left so little concerning him-&#xD;
self, that we can only say, he appears to have made, it his&#xD;
business to follow up, in a quiet and unsuspected way, a certain&#xD;
series of investigations, the purport and"tendency of which was&#xD;
to unveil a class of, crimes, which, from being secret, were en-&#xD;
abled to work and worm their way nearest to the core of the&#xD;
social state.-"&#xD;
Thus, in addition to the monstrous and unimagined vices de-&#xD;
scribed by him in the preceding-chapters,-he seems to have dis-&#xD;
covered secret combinations, the possibilities of which have&#xD;
probably never entered before into human brains, but the results&#xD;
of which were as prodigious as the causes were unsuspected.&#xD;
These were composed of no mystic demagogues of humaiita-&#xD;
rianism, who sheltered mere partisan and personal designs,&#xD;
under the broad curtain of secret rituals symbolising philan-&#xD;
thropic aims ;- no bald enthusiasts, who softly sunk their indi-&#xD;
vidualities -in an. Order, 'and sold their, god-like birthrights of&#xD;
universal' benevolence, of world-wide charity, for the -golden&#xD;
shackles of a ,pretentious benevolence, the selfish code ofwhichb&#xD;
was,-mutual protection first, and -nobody else afterwards! -&#xD;

a&#xD;
C&#xD;
&#xD;
These were wise, bold, hardened .men -hardened in the:&#xD;
rough contests by, the highways of life--who had seen all; felt&#xD;
all, and known all, that life could give or take. They were pre-&#xD;
paged for, any of its.extremes, but had outlived its sympathies.&#xD;
They were incarnations of pure intellection; the accomplish-&#xD;
ment of the object was their conscience -t-hey despised alle-&#xD;
gories, and.they trampled upon symbols. Nothing was myste-i&#xD;
rioJs to them, but an undigested purpose. For them there Was;&#xD;
no law but that might be eluded=-no sanctities, but as they&#xD;
might be used-no religion but necessity, which was, -to them,&#xD;
achievement!&#xD;
When -such men organised, they merely cane.together,-ten&#xD;
or a dozen of them,-they required no oaths, no pledges--they&#xD;
knew each other! "We hold such and such opinions upon&#xD;
one point only; and thatone point is, mutual interest, and tnder,&#xD;
that, 1st, that we can govern this nation;.2d, that to govern it,'&#xD;
we must subvert its institutions; and, 3d, subvert them we will&#xD;
It is our interest ; this is our only bond. Capital must have ex-&#xD;
pansion. .Thil hybrid republicanism saps the power of our great&#xD;
agent .by its obstinate competition. We must demoralise the&#xD;
republic. We must make public virtue a by-word and a mock-&#xD;
ery, and.private infamy to be honor. Begit ning with the people,&#xD;
through, our agents, we shall corrupt the State.&#xD;
"We must pamper superstition, and pension energetic fanati-&#xD;
cism--as on 'Change we degrade commercial honor, and make&#xD;
'success' the idol. . We' may fairly and' reasonably calculate,&#xD;
that within a succeeding generation, even our theoretical schemes&#xD;
of republican subversion maybe accomplished, and upon its-ruins&#xD;
be. erected-that 'noble-Oligarchy of caste and-wealth for which&#xD;
we all conspire,.as affording the only true-protection to capital.&#xD;
"Beside these genera views, we may in a thousand other ways&#xD;
.  apply our combined capital to immediate advantage. We may&#xD;
buy up, through our agents, claims upon litigated estates,-upon&#xD;
confiscated  bonds, mortgages-upon embarrassed property,&#xD;

in which ready-money is eagerly-grasped as the equivalent. for&#xD;
enormous prospective gains.&#xD;
"In addition 'through our monopoly of the mahufacturing in-&#xD;

soon be able to fill the masses-of operators and producers with&#xD;
such' distrust of each other, and fear of us, as to'disintegrate&#xD;
their radical combinations,-and bring themto our'feet. - Govern-&#xD;

the common-sense 'view of our interests -of the interests of&#xD;

we appoint and pension our secret agents; who are everywhere&#xD;
on the lookout for outinterests. We arrange correspondence,&#xD;
in cipher, throughcut the. -civilized world ; we pension our&#xD;
editors and our reporters; .We bribe our legislators, and, last of&#xD;

whose business it is, not alone to report to us the conduct of&#xD;
agents already employed, but to- find and report to us others,&#xD;

which held its secret sessions- in New York city. - He seems to&#xD;
have, obtained- a sight of some of their records, but by what&#xD;
means, the most daring could only conjecture. He appears to&#xD;
have regarded this particular organisation as the most formida-&#xD;

covert results, with A singularly dogged tenacity. -&#xD;

seem to convey.&#xD;
Having now presented- such an outline of the character, and&#xD;
designs of this secret conclave, as the means of information fur-&#xD;
nished him have enabled him to do,.the Editor will'proceed&#xD;
with the promised extracts from its proceedings, such as relate&#xD;
to thosein regard to whom the reader may be supposed to have&#xD;
some curiosity.&#xD;
First, we have here&#xD;
. A NOTE CONCERNING ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN.&#xD;
"This woman, whose patronymic was Softdown, first -mar-&#xD;
ried a Quaker, named Orne ; which name, after her separation,&#xD;
and until after her-divorce, she continued to bear, with"the alias&#xD;
of Marie. *She began her public career, soon after her marriage,&#xD;
as a Quaker preacher ; but the straitness of this sect Dot conform,&#xD;
ing at all to her latitudinarian principles, she recanted in; disgust,&#xD;
and left the society. She now plunged at once into Phfsiology,&#xD;
and, after a miraculously short gestation, produced a few leires,&#xD;
with which she went the rounds of two or three New England&#xD;
States, accompanied by her husband, whom she, sans ceremonie,&#xD;
dubbed M. D., without putting him to the trouble of reading,&#xD;
or ever having read, a book on any subject. He officiated as&#xD;
ner doorkeeper, and received the 'shillings;' but, refusing to&#xD;
render any account of the proceeds,-a furious feud grew up&#xD;
between them, and soon the war waxed hot and fierce.&#xD;
"Finding this to be poor business on thewhole, she deserted&#xD;
nim, taking her child with her.. Tie next occupation in-which&#xD;
we find her versatile genius engaged, was that of teaching&#xD;
French; a more humble. employment, surely, but one. for&#xD;
which she was equally well fitted. This, however, soon dis-&#xD;
gusted her, as her unreasonable. patrons would insist. upon&#xD;
the vulgar :necessity..of her being able to speak French, 'as&#xD;

&#xD;
wll a: teach it. It was at best but a tame avocation, and one&#xD;
entirely, unsuited to her ambitious temper.&#xD;
"Having now fairly assayed her wings for flight, she soared&#xD;
aloft at' once, ip full career, through mid-air. She. became first&#xD;
a preacher of Universalism.; but meeting, about this time, with&#xD;
the celebrated Boanerges Phospher, she, in a: few weeks; turned&#xD;
out fall-plunied, as a lecturer on Elocution.- To his she' soon&#xD;
addeda knowledge of Phrenology, which, in her active zeal,&#xD;
she-took care to impart to the world,, as fast as, acquired, and in,&#xD;
the same public m manner.&#xD;
" Then, as, a natural consequence, came Mesmerism; then&#xD;
Neurology. Of ill these sciences she became the prompt ex-&#xD;
pounder, .f er a few days' investigation.&#xD;
"From this point she immediately ascended a step higher, and&#xD;
announced herself as- a revelator in Clairvoyance ; and, by an&#xD;
inevitable-p.ogression, she at. once found admission, along with&#xD;
Andrew Jackson Davis and a'host of other seers, into the Swe-&#xD;
denborgian.Arcana, and held herself on terms of frequent inter-&#xD;
course and positive intimacy:with the angel Gabriel, and, indeed,&#xD;
the whole heavenly host.,&#xD;
They revealed to her that the great and unpardonable sins&#xD;
of humanity were, first, eating pork; second, using tobacco,&#xD;
whether snuffing, smoking, or chewing; and, third, wine-drink-&#xD;
ingin all its tfo ms. They accordingly commissioned her, form-&#xD;
ally, to go:brth into the world as a-missionary, to warn mankind-&#xD;
against, the fearful consequences of these vices, and to 'save'&#xD;
them therefrom.&#xD;
" Theexposition, of Grahamism and Bran-bread was now&#xD;
added to the enlarged circle of her enlightened Professorships;&#xD;
and, bye this aid,; and that of her spiritual commission, she&#xD;
wrought wonders, in assailing the, camps of the great foes of&#xD;
humanity-Pork, Tobacco, and Wine!&#xD;
"Many were the brands plucked by her from'the burning, or&#xD;
rather 'saved'--preachers, lawyers, .editors, artists, aid wa-&#xD;
tery-eyed young gentlemen, in -particular. It was or this grand&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
to r that she first assumed her most distinguished attribute, the&#xD;
Patroness of Art-particularly of the Artists.&#xD;
"Returning to civilization once more, she again assumed her&#xD;
cast-off Profesorship of Physiologf, and. began lecturing to&#xD;
classes of her own sex. Now, with the first gleam- of light&#xD;
from =Gr efenberg, she, pronounced herself as having.been, for&#xD;
many years before, a practiitibner of the system; and at once&#xD;
proceeded to combinetGrahamism, Mesmerismn, Water-cure,&#xD;
and Physiology.&#xD;
" While in the vein of Physiology, she also lectured on the&#xD;
benefits of Amalgamation, Abolitionism, and Non-resistance.&#xD;
About this time, having met with one of the chief expounders of&#xD;
Fourierism, whom she also undertook to 'save,' she turned out in&#xD;
a few weeks a Phalansterian lecturer. That bubble had' barely&#xD;
exploded, when she came forth a Communist. Shortly after-&#xD;
wards, having one or two editors 'separately undergoing the&#xD;
process of being 'saved,' she became authoress'!  She pro-&#xD;
duced several physiological novefs, :a number of essays, ppems,&#xD;
volumes of lectures, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
"The police which obey the mandates of the formidable&#xD;
Regulus, have kept the -changes of this feminine, Proteus for&#xD;
now upward of forty years, steadily in-view; and,the 'Council&#xD;
of Disorganisation report, through their comimittee, that they&#xD;
have ample reason to be.pleased with this Etherial Softdown, as&#xD;
the most indefatigable, active, unscrupulous, and energetic N of&#xD;
the agents of Demoralisation in the employment of the Secret&#xD;
Conclave.&#xD;
"UThey congratulate themselves in the belief that;with an hun-&#xD;
dred such employees devoted to their service, they could cor-.&#xD;
rupt the private faith and public virtue of the whole Union -so&#xD;
effectually,.in a single generation, as to enable them to utterly&#xD;
destroy its social organisation and subvert its Constitution:&#xD;
"This would, of course, secure the'desired Oligarchy of caste&#xD;
and wealth, and reduce the nation to'serfdom.&#xD;
"She is' to beencouraged, and placed upon the pension-list&#xD;
of the ' Secret Conclave.'&#xD;

ETHE1EIAL SOFTDOWN.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since this report, the latest transformations of*Etherial Soft&#xD;
down'have been, first, into rabid Bloomerism; in the height of&#xD;
which madness, she possessed a -suficiency of.the martyr-spirit&#xD;
to parade herself, 'on all public occasions,-though nearly- fifty&#xD;
years of age,.in full costume.&#xD;
By a'nedessary transition, the next step was into a apostle-&#xD;
'ship.of- the new school of 'Woman's,. Rights'- and 'Abolition-&#xD;
ism  which openly rejoiees.in the repudiation of the Bible from&#xD;
among the sacred books of the 'world-accepting it merely as&#xD;
the text-book -of popular. cantfto be used in working upon the&#xD;
passions and superstitions-of the mob-&#xD;
"'This last metamorphosis of Etilerial Softdown seems to be&#xD;
the most-promising of all those through which the polite of the&#xD;
'-onclave.' have,- thus far, been able to trace here" *" -&#xD;
&#xD;
* The' following note was received, in answer to one addressed to&#xD;
-distinguished surgeon of Philadelphia, in relation to the phenorne&#xD;
non of voluntary bleeding, so frequently illustrated in the History of&#xD;
Etherial-Softdown.--EIfR.&#xD;
DEA   SIR:     ' . -&#xD;
-"The case which you presented to ine, for an explanation of the causes&#xD;
which'may have produced volurntary discharges of blood from the mouth,&#xD;
is certainly a very remarkable one, though by no means without parallel&#xD;
'in the records of feigned diseases. The power of the will, in persons of&#xD;
peculiar, formation or constitution, is seen,' occasiorially, to be extended&#xD;
to- various organs' designed by. nature to act without awakening con-&#xD;
scipusneqs and in a manner altogether beyond the control of the .indi-&#xD;
vidual.- TQ say nothing of many muscles of the-scalp, the ears, the skin&#xD;
of the neck, &amp;amp;c., which) are used to great purpose by the inferior ani-&#xD;
mls,'but are totally mactive inmanexcept in afew rare instances, it&#xD;
i's well-known-that many persons posses's the power of voluntary'vormit-&#xD;
ig. Aboutforty years- ago, a man presented hiihself before a cele-&#xD;
brated;surgeon of Londen, and proved that he 'possessed the 'ability to&#xD;
check completely the flow of blood through the artery at the wrist, by&#xD;
violetly contracting. . muscle of the arm above. the elbow, which, in&#xD;
his case, happened to overlap and press' upon the' rain trunk of the&#xD;
vessel. I am acquaintedwith -a' gentleman in this, country, who can&#xD;
perform-the-same feat. There'is on record a well-authenticated history&#xD;

REPORTS OF THE SECRET CONCLAVE;&#xD;
WE continue our reports of the police of the " Conclave,"&#xD;
so far as we find them relating to Etherial Softdown.and her&#xD;
friends.&#xD;
of' a" man who could completely control, by will, the motions of his&#xD;
heart; and who, eventually, committed accidental suicide, by arresting&#xD;
the esoeulatlon so long that the heart never-reacted. Ilam acquainted&#xD;
with a gentleman who can voluntarily contract and dilate the pupil of&#xD;
the eye tgo asoertain extent; and have-seen the: same effect repeatedly,&#xD;
and in a far greater degree, 'Umong the-Hindoo jugglers. This action&#xD;
is natural in'the owl, but probably requires a peciliar nervous structure&#xD;
in man. So'mepersons have a power of'so completely simulating death,&#xD;
that neither by respiration, the motion of the ege'under light,-nor the&#xD;
pulse, could any-unprofessional observer, or even an experienced phy-&#xD;
siian, detect the counterfeit. One of my servants in India, struck&#xD;
another Jlindoodwith his open hand, for some impertinence. The man&#xD;
instantly -fell, apparently dead ; and L happened' to arrive just as the&#xD;
friends -were about to remove the body, no doubt for the purpose of ex-&#xD;
torting money by concealhent and false pretences,' I could perceive-no&#xD;
respiration (the glass-tet was not applied), no pulse at the wrist; 'the&#xD;
pupil of the'eye wad fixed in all lights. There was, however, a slight&#xD;
thrilling in the carotid artery; and I judged the case to be- one of ad.&#xD;
mirable feigning.' Severe pinching-was borne without change of ex-&#xD;
pression, -as was- also the deep prick' of a pin. For a; usement, I-&#xD;
pronounced' him dead,'but assured the ignorant natives that -1 would&#xD;
bring bim to life. On my calling for a little pan ofc'al; always ready&#xD;
in a bachelor drawing-room in the East,:ffr lighting eigars,;-there. came.&#xD;
over'the countenanethe. slightest possible shade of anxiety. I ordered&#xD;
the' patient's abdomen laid bare, and gentlyltoppled a bright coal from&#xD;
the pan upon it. The effect was magical. Instantly, tlke fellow gave,&#xD;
the most lively :evidences of vitality; -and, -as he crossed the Compound&#xD;
and darted through the gateway, he seemed solely; bent upon rivaling&#xD;
the mysterious' industry of the I man with the cork-leg.'  --.&#xD;

This report -says of Eusedora Polypheme :-" This woman&#xD;
is between thirty and 'thirty-five'.years of -age. She is of New&#xD;
England birth, and eonumenced her ,education at what we' con-&#xD;
sider the female high-schools of demnoralisation on the Conti-&#xD;
nent-' the factories.'&#xD;
" These estalAishments are. especially 'patronised by the&#xD;
"Council of Disorganisation,' who consider them of vast effi-&#xD;
ciency, on account of -the well-understood certainty with which&#xD;
the results' we aim at are achievedunder this system.  So great&#xD;
is this certainty, indeed, that we may always 'safely calculate&#xD;
that eight-tenths of the females who seek employment in them&#xD;
come forth, if they ever do live, ino ulated. with just such&#xD;
principles and habits as we dtesire to have spread among the&#xD;
rural population to whiclthe'.'majority of them return. -tCot-&#xD;
rupted themselves,' they act aas'dinirable mediums and con-&#xD;
ductors of corruption to the class from whom they went forth&#xD;
iniocent, and 5hich receives them again without suspicion.&#xD;
Besides the spinal diseases, affections of 'the lungs, twisted&#xD;
"By strong Contraction of all the muscles of the chest, while those&#xD;
of thesneck' are rigid and the lungs fully-inflated, the vessels of the head&#xD;
and neck can be, distended' almost to bursting.. Actors sometimes' use&#xD;
this power to produce .voluntary blushing,"or the suffusion of anger,&#xD;
though the practice endangers apoplexy. Take this to'be the secret&#xD;
of the voluntary bleeding, in the case describedby you.&#xD;
!'" The 'tonsils, andthe fmembrane of the throat behind,.the nose and&#xD;
mioutb arg full.of innumerable blood-vessels, forming a -net-work ; and&#xD;
very slight causedoften" produce great enlargement of these vessels.&#xD;
By frequent temporary distension, theyare. not only permanently en-&#xD;
larged, but.made more susceptilrle; of additiona.-expansion from trivial&#xD;
accidents. 'In this conditions'they may brought to resemble, in some&#xD;
degree, what is termed,'by-anatomists, dhe erectile issue, which' struc-&#xD;
ture has sufficient contractility to prevent the 'admission of more than&#xD;
au ordinary amount of blood on common occasions, but when excited&#xD;
in any wayhit yields with great ease, and admits of enormous ilata-&#xD;
tion. . Erectiletumors are dangerous,from theirtendency, ultimately,&#xD;
to reedpontaneoaly. They are sometimes former inlrthe that Te&#xD;

bodies, and deformed limbs, which the greater number of these&#xD;
girls take home with them, all the foolish .romanticism of girl-&#xD;
hood has been thoroughly crushed out of them, by the morale&#xD;
which we have promoted in these institutions, and theirminds&#xD;
and tastes have become even more vitiated than their bodies.&#xD;
"It will thus be seen that this factory system  is our chef-&#xD;
d'auvre of demoralisation of the simple agricultural classes.&#xD;
'But in yet another aspect' the results, it will be perceived,&#xD;
are still more brilliant. We soon found the necessity of creat-&#xD;
ing a public sentiment in favor of our system, which would put&#xD;
a stop to officious investigation and interference with our plans.&#xD;
We accordingly established a defensive literature, in the shape&#xD;
of dainty serials, announced as being edited by the factory-girls&#xD;
themselves. These were filled with sentimental effusions, written&#xD;
principally to order, outside the factories, the general burdenof&#xD;
which consisted in poetico-rural pictures. of .the joys brought&#xD;
horne -by the patient~ atnd industrious factory-girl, to. some hip-&#xD;
shotten father or bedridden grand-papa.  These little incidents&#xD;
sels by habitual mechanical distension, by compressing the chest in the&#xD;
manner just described.. There is such a natural tendency, in all parts&#xD;
about the throat and nose, to bleed from slight causes, particularly&#xD;
after repeated inflammation, that it strikes me as by no means wonder-&#xD;
ful, that a designing person should, by long-practised mechanical efforts,&#xD;
aided, perhaps, by the consequences of former colds, reduce these-prts&#xD;
to a condition such that they would bleed from voluntary distension.&#xD;
The only wonder in the case is the quantity discharged, while this person&#xD;
does not appears to be subject to involuntary hemorrhage also. This&#xD;
result will probably occur hereafter, and the impostor may share the&#xD;
fate of the man who arrested the motion of his heart.&#xD;
"These cases of feigned diseases give great vexation to army sur-&#xD;
geons and almshouse physicians; and, in :private life, are often resorted&#xD;
to by the cunning'and unprincipled, for the .purpose of harrowing the&#xD;
feelings of relatives, from some sinister intention. It might well be&#xD;
wished, that the case you -describe were one.of the most difficult 6f de:&#xD;
tection, but it is far from being so.&#xD;

were studiously invested with all that'charming unexpectedness&#xD;
and die-away'bathos, which is so attractive to girlish imagina-&#xD;
tions; and so satisfactory to elder philanthropists. Then there&#xD;
was still another' class of romances,, cultivated with yet -more&#xD;
fervid unction.' These consisted in stories of a 'lovely young&#xD;
girl,'who,:all' for 'love of independence;' gave up a home of&#xD;
luxury, to comwsto the factories and make a living for herself,&#xD;
independent of her natural guardians. How this stout-hearted&#xD;
young ladyone day attracted, by her beauty, the-attention of a&#xD;
handsorfe young-gentleman of romantic appearance, vho visited&#xD;
the mills along with a party of other strangers.. HoW the sro-&#xD;
mantic young gentleman was very -much 'struck, while the&#xD;
strong-minded Angelina was rendered' nervous ; how the&#xD;
heart!-stricken' after many trials, succeeded in moving -upon&#xD;
the heart of the ' sleepless gryphon' of morality with whom&#xD;
Angelina boarded, to permit him to have an interview  at&#xD;

young gentleman, in the most 'proper' way declared h self,&#xD;

out to be te son' of a' Southern nabob, and Angelina, from'a&#xD;
poor factory-girl, became one of the foremost ladies of the land;-&#xD;

Out.of one or two thousand girls, there are usually a few&#xD;
who exhibit some sprightliness. In the ratio of the ductility&#xD;

"We expect gratitude from all such. favored parties;rand&#xD;
Eusedora proved. the most grateful  of the grateful.  She as&#xD;
readily took to the shallow limpidity of Mr. Little, alias Tommy&#xD;
Noore, as ever did callow cygnet to the drains of a Holland flat.&#xD;
She possessed, indeed, a marvellous gift of sentiment-a sac-&#xD;
chariferous faculty, that would have caused Cerberus himself to&#xD;
have licked his jagged lips. She was accordingly encouraged&#xD;
to cultivate transcendental, tendencies, exchanged with the Dial,&#xD;
and, after a- few months' exercise, she spoke like a veritable&#xD;
thoness.&#xD;

familiar with&#xD;

nothing but a factory-girl. They must be eminent institutions&#xD;
surely, since they could turn .out young ladies who talked so&#xD;
' divinely,' possessed 'such' command of language, and were&#xD;
such favorites with the gentlemen!&#xD;
"There was- a society, too, not very far off from this, into&#xD;
which she had forced her way,.and which haughtily called itself&#xD;
'the' best,' that held its court in houses with dingy outsides, that.&#xD;
lined the back-alleys; but, amidst garish ;and sickening splen-&#xD;

"When a class is already sunk as low as it can sink, it is rit&#xD;
our policy to go aside to interfere with themyfor they are sure&#xD;
to fecundate in degradation fast enough; our sole aim is to drag&#xD;
the grades above down to their level, which we consider a sWfe&#xD;
one   .&#xD;
" There is nothing so dangerous to the designs of the-'Corn.&#xD;
mitfee of Disorganisation, as soul ---what the world calls heart.&#xD;
To an executive power, these are always considered intrusive&#xD;
and distasteful superfluities; and it vas because Eusedora has&#xD;
managed, by some surprisingly efficient process, to rid herself&#xD;
of both, that she is to be so-trusted.&#xD;
"Besides parading her accomplishments everywhere, as&#xD;
merely a fair average of the education of a factory-girl, she&#xD;
very soon mapped out for herself a very peculiar field for ope-&#xD;
rations. She became the -leader 'of a new school of Platonic&#xD;
Sentimentalism, in New England. This was an achievement---&#xD;
a decided triumph. She soon gathered around her a host of.&#xD;
feminine disciples--principally young and unmarried, with pre-&#xD;
mature wrinkles on their brows.,&#xD;
"After years of close observation of the operations of this&#xD;
sect, its police would' beg to express to the Committee their&#xD;
unqualified admiration of the results obtained. Theincrease&#xD;
of the number of suicides hasbeen gratifying. The number&#xD;
of young men and girls rendered worthless-for life ; the number&#xD;
of elderly men plundered and cajoled out of their means and&#xD;
driven into dotage, is only equalled by the surprising rapidity&#xD;
with which the fanaticism has spread; indeed, it would seem as&#xD;
if thg first step towards all the popular forms of fanaticism, is&#xD;
through Platonic Senfimentalism.&#xD;
" It seems, that it is'through the teachings of this school, of&#xD;
which Tusedora Polypheme is now the acknowledged priestess,&#xD;
that the hollowness and unsatisfactory character of all, our natu-&#xD;
ral sentiments and passions is first perceived. This illumination&#xD;
achieved, it becomes necessary that their place be supplied by&#xD;
what the world would call morbid sentimentality and unnatural&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
ETIIERIAL POlTDOWN.24&#xD;
passions, but which Eusedora P4lypheme aptly terms, 'spherical&#xD;
illuminations' and ' divine ecsthcies.' But since we know, as&#xD;
well as Eusedora, that flesh is ft sh, aid blood is blood, we can&#xD;
therefore calculate, with great precision, whither such mystifica-&#xD;
tions must lead,&#xD;
"Hardened and sharpened in mind and temper, by a gradu-&#xD;
ation in- this school, its disciples pass, not from it, but through it,&#xD;
'into other, and, to us, not less important fields of activity. Hence.&#xD;
come the fiercest and most unscrupulous partisans of Infidelity,&#xD;
Abolitionism, and Woman's Rights. Having learned both theo-&#xD;
retically and practically to disbelieve in themselves, by the- most&#xD;
natural transition in the world, they become, infidel of all other&#xD;
truths, and 'scorn all other sacrednesses alike. They are then&#xD;
prepared. to be of use to us in a variety of ways. The spirit of&#xD;
antagonism, the love of strife and notoriety, have assumed in&#xD;
them the sense of duty, justice, and modesty ; a spiritual diabllerie.&#xD;
has possessed itself of the" emasculated 'remains of womanhood&#xD;
left in them. Only give them a chance for martyrdom -only&#xD;
give them an excuse for the cry of persecution, and upon what-&#xD;
ever theme or theory, ology or ism, that may promise to afford&#xD;
then. such healthful and natural excitements, they will at once&#xD;
seize, and, hugging the dear abstraction to their bosoms, do&#xD;
battle for the same, with a cunning and unscrupulous ferocity&#xD;
that has no parallel.&#xD;
"But for their thorough training under the teaching of Euse-&#xD;
dora Polypheme, they might, perhaps, be sometimes disposed&#xD;
to pause, and inquire if there might not be two sides to every&#xD;
question; whether they might not have made some slight mis-&#xD;
take in crying out 'Eureka' so soon. But, fortunately,' they&#xD;
are never troubled with this weakness; and, as their capacity&#xD;
for mischief is not, therefore, liable to be impaired by any maud-&#xD;
lin conscientiousness, or feeble questioning of their own infalli-&#xD;
bility, or that of their teachers, they are from the beginning as&#xD;
valuable as trained veterans.&#xD;

facility/constitutes their logic; and their efficiency in the use&#xD;
of this weapon, consists in the savage, 'waspish, and persevering=&#xD;
iteration of, its phrases, at all times and on all occasions.&#xD;
"It is astonishing, 'the ease with which the majority of man,&#xD;
kind. can be bullied, -especially from within the bulwark of pet-&#xD;
ticoats. But when at once the terrible aspect is hid behind the&#xD;
mask of Circe, as the followers of Polypheme know so well to&#xD;
accomplish, the lower becomes resistless indeed.&#xD;
"' rhe principal weapons of-offence used by the followers of&#xD;
Polypheme, in all their subsequent metamorphoses, are, first and&#xD;
foremost, what is technically termed the 'electrical eye.' This&#xD;
is the most brilliant 'and. effective of their weapons. It is not&#xD;
by any nwans necessary that the spiritual Amazon should have&#xD;
been gifted by Nature, in this respect ; for the arts of Polypheme&#xD;
were clearly inspired from&#xD;
'Some other deity than Nature,&#xD;
That shapes man better.'&#xD;
"After 'long practice, the power is acquired of dilating or&#xD;
straining the 'eyes wide open, and suffusing them at the same&#xD;
time." The moisture gives them a marvellous effect of electrical&#xD;
splendor. As this habitual tension can only besustained for a&#xD;
few seconds at a time, Polypheme- happily offsets it by the&#xD;
modest habit of dropping her eyes towards the floor, or a&#xD;
filow4r or book in her hand; then up go the&#xD;
'Downy windows close'&#xD;
And out leaps-another  humid flash, to electrify her audience.&#xD;
" Greatenergy and activity of gesticulation is recommended,&#xD;
in order to distract attention, as much as possible, from the fact,&#xD;
that these' cruelly-worked 'eyes sometimes run4 over with the&#xD;
'salt-iheum'=-of any thing but,'grief.' A loud voice, too, is&#xD;
especially recommended-as, without it, somebody else might&#xD;
be heard in the room.&#xD;
"Secondly, a thorough knowledge of the minor dramatics of'&#xD;
&#xD;
_       _  ,&#xD;
&#xD;
247&#xD;
&#xD;
emphasis is also suggested. Sneers should be thoroughly practised&#xD;
before the glass, as well as interjections, exclamations, shrieks of&#xD;
wonder and surprise. The grimace of rage, worked up with great&#xD;
ferocity, without the slightest regard to the poor victim. Scorn&#xD;
should be lofty and incredibly superb; archness, irresistible,&#xD;
taking care not to pucker the wrinkles in the brow too much;&#xD;
sentiment, nothing short of the white rolling-up of two huge&#xD;
spheres in spasm. Childlike simplicity requires great practice&#xD;
in the dancing-room; it is very effective, when artisticallydone.&#xD;

" Travelling should be studied as an art. The many corre-&#xD;
spondences held in different portions, of the country should be&#xD;
made the dutiful occasion of sentimental {visits, which, as they&#xD;
may be protracted for a month or two, will, no doubt, result in&#xD;
the effectual 'saving' of some half-dozen, at the very least, of&#xD;
both sexes. Neither scrip nor money need be provided for the&#xD;
journey; for is not the laborer worthy of his hire?: Besides, who&#xD;
ever heard of a. lioness carrying a purse? The world owes all&#xD;
its benefactors a living.&#xD;
" It is necessary to be an authoress-abundantly prolific and&#xD;
intensely literary: to write dashing, slashing, graceful letters,&#xD;
in which your own superbhorsewomanship 'shall always figure&#xD;
most prominently;, next, your own disinterestedness; next,&#xD;
your own amiability, and dangerous powers of attraction; and,&#xD;

never fails that, bg a species of spontaneous' acclaim, she is&#xD;
selected to' preside "over all convocations of 'the 'faithful;'&#xD;
whether held in public or in private&#xD;
" By tacit consent, she has, therefore, -come to- be regarded&#xD;
as the actual figure-head of the' bark of Progress; and, hence,&#xD;
there is no movement,. on the part of feminine schismatics,&#xD;
worthy of attention,'to which "she has chosen to deny her pre-&#xD;
siding countenance.V&#xD;
"This renders her, of course, a very formidable and import-&#xD;
ant person, in all the 'New-Iight' agitations of the day. Con-&#xD;
scious of supremacy, she exercises it without hesitation; and,&#xD;
with a boldness that is startling to' all parties, dares to assert&#xD;
outright those opinions which, in reality, lie at the bottom of the&#xD;
whole agitation in which they are engaged.,  '&#xD;
"Indeed, not only does she defiantly-assert them openly on&#xD;
all occasions, but openly lives up to them in the face of socir&#xD;
ety. While hier followers modestly say, they-want wonan's ciif&#xD;
rights in marriage, she courageously asserts, that there is no mr-&#xD;
riage except in love, and that the civil contract is -like any other&#xD;
partnership in which equivalents are exchanged.; and, by way&#xD;
of proof of her sincerity, she boasts, publicly and privately, of&#xD;
the'terms on which she married her'present husband ; -who, by&#xD;
the way, possessed considerable property. 'I do not love you',&#xD;
sir,' said she; 'I love another man, whom you k,.ow. If you&#xD;
choose to take me on these conditions, I an ready to mary&#xD;
you.&#xD;
"yThe charming candor of this proposal won the day; and&#xD;
the superannuated'-sew-Light' Was fain content to exchange&#xD;
his hand and fortune for her hand, and to leave her heart to&#xD;
settle its affairs in some other direction.&#xD;
. ' This is the sort of frankness in which the ' Comrtittee of&#xD;
Disorganisation' do most rejoice. They regard it as a highly&#xD;
favourable -oten, when a 'distiguished female' can take such&#xD;

&#xD;
grounds as this, and be publicly sustained by thousands of her&#xD;
sex; for with whatever gravity they may pretend to repudiate&#xD;
the doings of Regina Straightback, in this one particular, it is&#xD;
very certain, that they must regard it with secret favor, and that,&#xD;
this is the principal cause of her universal and overwhelming&#xD;
popularity.,&#xD;
"They regard her with a species -of covert adoration -as' a&#xD;
heroine, who has first, since Fanny Wright,. dared, in living up&#xD;
to. principle, to do thatwhich they are, all, in, reality, yearning&#xD;
for courage to do themselves.&#xD;
"The chaos -of 'social. licentiousness, to which the- general&#xD;
acceptationI of such doctrine as-this must lead, may be regarded,&#xD;
to.say the least of it, as pleasantly nmelo-dramatic. When one&#xD;
woman may go to the house of another, and say,"' Though thou'&#xD;
hast been bound to this. man, in the holy bonds of matrimony, yet&#xD;
these bonds are of no moral force; though thou hast borne to this&#xD;
man children from iis loins, yet the- factthat thou hast suffered&#xD;
gives thee no claim upon him, for it is the penalty of 'thy sex;&#xD;
and. that they are bone of thy bone, pnd flesh of his flesh, gives&#xD;
thee. no just hold upon him, but rather upon the' State. And if&#xD;
thou hast 'nursed' him in sickness, he' -has fed-thee and clothed&#xD;
thee, in ample, equivalent; if thou hast loved him, he has loved&#xD;
thee'; if thou. lowest him still, it- is, 'thy weakness. Get thee&#xD;
gone!' This man no longer loveth thee; he is mine. Thou&#xD;
shalt surrender to me thy nuptial couch; there is no true mar-&#xD;
riage but in love!'&#xD;
"Nor does the ~candor of Regina Straightback rest with&#xD;
practical declarations such 'as these ; she goes quite as,. far&#xD;
in other: directions.  She does not hesitate to denounce .the&#xD;
Bible, as sanctioning all the oppressions of woman-as the mere&#xD;
tool of the priesthood, the orthodox of whom are banded, to a&#xD;
man, in mortal opposition' to their rights. She recommends the&#xD;
use of it, as a means-to those who are more disposed than she&#xD;
is to Jesuitism:of ,conquering by. indirections.  They may&#xD;
influence and control the masses, by invoking its sanction, to be&#xD;

&#xD;
sure ; but she, for her own part, will..have nothing to do with&#xD;
subterfuges; she rejects the Bible systemin toto, as-false-false&#xD;
in fact and tendency. God has made woman sufficient unto&#xD;
herself in the universe. She can and ought to protect herself;&#xD;
and if she does not, it's her own fault.&#xD;
" The Bible might do for men; but women possess a higher&#xD;
spirituality, and stronger intuitions; they do not need it. Man,&#xD;
with his heavy logic, never gets beyond a truism or a self-evi-&#xD;
dent fact, of the .mere physical world; while woman, with her&#xD;
electrical inspiration, leaps the ' large lengths' of universal law,&#xD;
and, like a conquering presence, glides within the spiritual,&#xD;
supreme. It is thus that, scorning all bonds of sense, she&#xD;
knoweth that she doth know !&#xD;
"The announcement of these tremendous propositions would,&#xD;
of course,.be calculated to have an overwhelming effect upon&#xD;
the tender adolescence of thousands of bright spirits -- to elec-&#xD;
trify their hearts and souls with the novel consciousness of&#xD;
claims and attributes, of which they had never dreamed them-&#xD;
selves or their sex to be possessors.&#xD;
"The result has been, of necessity, the, institution of a femi-&#xD;
nine order of 'knight-errantry,'of which the Quixote has yet to&#xD;
be sung.&#xD;
" The Committee do not generally employ such agents as&#xD;
Regina Straightback; but as the time seems to have practically&#xD;
arrived, owing to the preparatory labors of Etherial Softdown&#xD;
and Eusedora Polypheme, they seem to have conceded that&#xD;
such ppretensions may be safely risked, though, it is well known,&#xD;
they usually do far more harm than good to any cause.&#xD;
"The fact that such a step may be safely ventured upon,&#xD;
seems to be the most encouraging token of the progress already&#xD;
achieved, and of the ultimate and triumphant success of the&#xD;
exertions of the ' Committee of Disorganisation.'"&#xD;

"These most tastefully printed and bound volumes form the first instalment of a series of State&#xD;

ter, may enter household channels from which the others would be excluded by their cost and&#xD;

nave a place in the family library of every American."- N. Y. Courier and Enquirer.&#xD;
"The importance of a series of State History like those now in preparation, can scarcely be esti-&#xD;
mated. Being condensed as carefully as accuracy and interest of narrative will permit, the size&#xD;
and price of the volumes will bring them within the reach of every family in the country, thus&#xD;
making them home-reading books for old and young. Each individual will, in consequence, bec-&#xD;
familiar, not only with the history of his own State, but with that of the other States; thus mutual&#xD;

ISM WITHOUT CHRISTIANITY:&#xD;
With Notes by the Editor on the Literature of Charity, Population, Pauperism, Political&#xD;
'Economy, and Protestantism.&#xD;
"The great question which the book discusses is, whether the Church of this age is what the&#xD;
primitive Church was,,and-whether Christians-both pastors and people-are doing theirduty. Our&#xD;
author believes not, and, to our mind, he has made out a strong base. He thinks there is abundant&#xD;
room for reform at the present timer and that it is needed almost as much as in the days of Luther.&#xD;
And why 1''Because, in his own words, 'While one portion of nominal Christians have busied&#xD;
themselves with forms and ceremonies and observances; with pictures, images,.and processions;&#xD;
others have given to doctrines the supremacy, and have busied themselves in laying down the&#xD;
lines by which'to enforce human belief-lines of interpretation by Which to control human opinion&#xD;
'-lines of discipline and restraint, by which-to bring human minds to uniformity of faith and action.&#xD;
They have formed creeds and catechisms; they have,spread themselves over the whole seld of the&#xD;
sacred writings, and scratched up all the surface; they have gathered all the straws, and turned&#xD;
over all'the pebbles, and detected the colour and determined the optjine of every stone and tree&#xD;
and shrub; they have dwelt'with rapture upon all that was beautiful-and sublime; but they have&#xD;
trampled over mines of golden wisdom, of surpassing richness and depthalmost without a thought,&#xD;
and almost without an effort to fathom these priceless'treasures, much less to take possession&#xD;
of them "&#xD;

WANDERINGS OF AN AMERICAN IN GREAT BRITAIN,&#xD;
IN 1851 AND '52.&#xD;
BY BENJAMIN MORAN.&#xD;
This volume embodies the observations-of the anthor, made during, eight. months' wanderings,&#xD;
as a correspondent for American Journals; and as he travelled much on foot, differs essentially&#xD;
from those on the same countries, by other writers. The habits, manners, [ustoms, and condition&#xD;
of the people have been carefully noted, and his views of them are given in clear, bold language&#xD;
His remarks take a wide range, and as he visited every county in England but three, there will be&#xD;
much in the work of a novel and instructive character.&#xD;
