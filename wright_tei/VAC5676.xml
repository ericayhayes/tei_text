               <head type="sub">SUNSHINE.</head>
               <p>"The last day of October!" said the Sun to himself,—"the last day of my favorite
                  month, and the birthday of my little namesake! See if I don't make the most of
                  it!"</p>
               <p>So the Sun called to all the winds and all the breezes, who, poor things! had but
                  just gone to bed after a terrible night's work, ordering them to get up directly,
                  and sweep the sky as clear as a bell; and bid all the clouds, whether big white
                  mountains, little pinky islands, sweeping mares'-tails, or freckled mackerel-back,
                  to put themselves out of the way, and keep out of it until November; when, as the
                  Sun remarked with a sigh, they would have it all their own way.</p>
               <p>"And as soon as that job's done," continued he, "you may go to bed again in the
                  Mountains of the Moon; for you will only disturb me if you are about."</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5676-00000005"/>
               <p>So the winds, grumbling and sighing a little, went to their work; and the Sun,
                  after a good dip in the Atlantic Ocean, began to roll up the eastern sky, flecking
                  the waves with diamond spray, touching up the gay-colored leaves still clinging to
                  the forest-trees, blazing on the town and city clocks to let every one know how
                  late it was, and finally thrusting his saucy glances into all the windows to see
                  how many persons had needed him.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, you city-folks!" cried the Sun. "Your neighbors in the country were
                  up before I was, and have eaten their breakfasts, and half cleared it away by this
                  time; and here are you just beginning to dress yourselves! Hurry up, I say! hurry
                  up! It is the last day of October, don't you know? and to-morrow will be
                  November.</p>
               <p>"But, at the corner house of a handsome square, the Sun found himself better
                  satisfied; for through the windows of the dining-room he saw a lady and gentleman
                  seated at the table, having apparently almost finished their breakfast.</p>
               <p>"That is better," remarked the Sun: and, thrusting one of his slender golden
                  fingers through the window, he touched the stag's head upon the cover of the
                  silver coffee-pot; glanced off, and sparkled in the cut glass of the goblets and
                  egg-glasses; flickered across the white and gilt china; pierced the fiery heart of
                  the diamond upon the first finger of the lady's left hand, and then, creeping
                  swiftly up her white throat, played joyously in her golden curls, and even darted
                  into her soft blue eyes, making them sparkle as brilliantly as the diamond.</p>
               <p>"The sun shines directly in your face, Fanny," said Mr. Legrange, admiring the
                  color in his wife's hair. "Shall I lower the shade?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! thank you. I never want the sunshine shut out," replied she, moving her
                  chair a little.</p>
               <p>"Not to-day of all days in the year, I suppose; not on the birthday of our little
                  Sunshine. And where is she?" asked Mr. Legrange, half turning his chair from the
                  table to the fire, and unfolding the damp newspaper beside his plate.</p>
               <p>"I told Susan to send her down as soon as she had done her breakfast. Hark! I hear
                  her." And the Sun, drawing his finger across the mother's lips, helped them to so
                  bright a smile, that her husband said,—</p>
               <p>"I am afraid we have more than our share of Sunshine, or at least that I have,
                  little wife."</p>
               <p>The bright smile grew so bright as the lady bent a little toward her husband, that
                  the Sun whispered,—</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5676-00000006"/>
               <p>"There's no need of sun here, I plainly see," but, for all that, crept farther
                  into the room; while the door opened, and in skipped a little girl, who might have
                  been taken for the beautiful lady at the head of the table suddenly diminished to
                  childish proportions, and dressed in childish costume, but with all her beauty
                  intensified by the condensation: for the blue eyes were as large and clear, and
                  even deeper in their tint; the clustering hair was of a brighter gold; and the
                  fair skin pearlier in its whiteness, and richer in its rosiness; while the gay
                  exuberance of life, glowing and sparkling from every curve and dimple of the
                  child's face and figure, was, even in the happy mother's face, somewhat dimmed by
                  the shadows that still must fall upon every life past its morning, be it never so
                  happy, or never so prosperous.</p>
               <p>"Morning, mamma and papa. It's my birthday; and I'm six years old,—six, six years
                  old! One, two, three, four, five, six years old! Susan told them all to me, and
                  Susan said she guessed papa didn't forgotten it. She didn't forgotten it; and
                  see!"</p>
               <p>The child held up a gay horn of sugar-plums fluttering with ribbons, and then,
                  hugging it to her breast with one hand, plunged the other in, and offered a little
                  fistful of the comfits, first to her father, and then to her mother. Both
                  smilingly declined the treat, explaining that they had but just done breakfast:
                  and the young lady, dropping some back into the horn, thrust the rest into her own
                  mouth, saying, "So has I; but I like candy all the day."</p>
               <p>"Come here, you little Sunshine," said Mr. Legrange, drawing her toward him. "So
                  Susie thought I hadn't forgotten your birthday, eh? Well, do you know what they
                  always do to people on their birthdays?"</p>
               <p>"Give 'em presents," replied the child promptly, as she desperately swallowed the
                  mouthful of candy.</p>
               <p>"Ho, ho! that's it is it? No; but, besides that, they always pull their ears as
                  many times as they are years old. Now, then, don't you wish I had forgotten
                  it?"</p>
               <p>Sunshine's eyes grew a little larger, and travelled swiftly toward her mother's
                  face, coming back to her father's with a smile.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe you'd hurt me much, papa," said she, nestling close to his
                  side.</p>
               <p>The father folded her tightly in his arms, lifting her to a seat upon his
                  knee.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe I would, little Sunshine. Well, then, sometimes, instead of
                  pinches, they give little girls as many kisses as they are years old. How will
                  that do?"</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5676-00000007"/>
               <p>The rosy mouth, gathering for a kiss, answered without words; but Mr. Legrange,
                  taking the dimpled face between his hands, said,—</p>
               <p>"No, no! we must go on deliberately. One for the forehead, two for the eyes,—that
                  makes three; one for each cheek makes five; and now the last and best for the lips
                  makes six. Next year, there will be another for the chin, and, after that, one in
                  each ear: won't that be nice?"</p>
               <p>"And mamma? Hasn't Sunshine any kisses for her this morning?" asked Mrs.
                  Legrange.</p>
               <p>The child slid from her father's knee to the floor, and, with her arms round her
                  mother's neck, whispered,—</p>
               <p>"I'll give mamma all these kisses papa just gave me, and some more too."</p>
               <p>And for a minute or two it would have been hard to say to which head the showery
                  golden curls belonged, or which pair of lips was the kisser's, and which the
                  kissed; while the Sun fairly danced with delight as he wrapped the two in a
                  beautiful golden mantle woven of his choicest beams.</p>
               <p>Mr. Legrange looked on, laughing, for a moment, and then said,—</p>
               <p>"So Susan told you people get presents on their birthdays, did she,
                  'Toinette?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa;" and the child, half turning from her mother, but still clinging round
                  her neck, looked at her father roguishly.</p>
               <p>"And I guess you knew it before, and didn't forgotten about it, did you, papa?"
                  asked she.</p>
               <p>"Well, yes, I believe I have heard something of the kind," said Mr. Legrange,
                  gravely considering; "but, dear me! did you expect me to make you a present?"</p>
               <p>'Toinette's face grew rather blank; and a sudden impulse turned down the corners
                  of her mouth with a little tremble across the lips. But the instinct of native
                  refinement and delicacy overcame the disappointment; and, coming to her father's
                  side, the child put her hand in his with a brave little smile, saying,—</p>
               <p>"It's no matter, papa dear. I've got ever so many pretty things up in the nursery;
                  and Susan gave me the candy."</p>
               <p>Mr. Legrange looked at his wife.</p>
               <p>"Your own child, Fanny. O Sunshine, Sunshine! what are you coming to by and by?
                  But bless me! what is this in the pocket of my dressing-gown? Let me take it out,
                  lest it should hurt you when I set you in my lap again. Funny-looking little box,
                  isn't it?</p>
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5676-00000008"/>
               <p>As he spoke, Mr. Legrange laid upon the table a long, flat box of red morocco,
                  with some gilt letters upon the top.</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa. What's in the box?" asked 'Toinette, still with a little effort.</p>
               <p>"What do you think, Sunshine?"</p>
               <p>"I guess it's some cigars, papa."</p>
               <p>"It would make a good cigar-case, to be sure; but you know I have one already, and
                  mamma says I ought not to have any. Let us peep in, and see what else the box
                  would be good for besides cigars."</p>
               <p>He unfastened the little hooks holding down the cover as he spoke, and placed the
                  casket in 'Toinette's hands. She raised the lid, and uttered a low cry; while her
                  face flushed scarlet with surprise and pleasure.</p>
               <p>Upon the white satin lining, lay two bracelets of coral cameos, linked with gold,
                  and fastened by a broad golden clasp.</p>
               <p>"Are they pretty?" asked Mr. Legrange, smiling at the eager little face upraised
                  to his.</p>
               <p>"Oh! they are lovely pretty. O papa ! oh! is they?"—</p>
               <p>"Yes they are yours, Sunshine. Mamma said you had been begging for some bracelets
                  like Minnie Wall's; and so, as I had heard that people sometimes liked presents on
                  their birthdays, and as I had not forgotten when Sunshine's came, I thought I
                  would bring her a pair."</p>
               <p>The excess of 'Toinette's rapture would not allow of speech; but Mrs. Legrange,
                  peeping over her shoulder, exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"Why, Paul! those are not what I asked you to get. I told you common coral beads,
                  strung on elastic, and fastened with a little snap."</p>
               <p>"But these were so much prettier, my dear, and will be of some value when she
                  grows up, as the others would not. At any rate, they are marked: so we must keep
                  them now. See!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Legrange touched a tiny spring; and the upper part of the clasp, opening upon
                  a hinge, showed a plate beneath, engraved with the name, "Antoinette
                  Legrange."</p>
               <p>"Yes: they are certainly very handsome; and 'Toinette must be as careful of them
                  as possible. They will be just right to loop up her sleeves while she is so
                  little, and, when she is older, to wear as bracelets," said Mrs. Legrange
                  admiringly.</p>
               <p>"I may wear them this afternoon at my party, mayn't I, mamma?" asked 'Toinette,
                  trying to clasp one upon her little arm.</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5676-00000009"/>
               <p>"Oh, we are to have a party, are we!" exclaimed Mr. Legrange raising his eyebrows
                  in dismay.</p>
               <p>"Just half a dozen children to play with 'Toinette, and to go home after a
                  nursery-tea," explained his wife.</p>
               <p>"Oh, well! I shall be a little late to dinner, very likely: so it will all be over
                  when I arrive. Shall I bring Tom Burroughs home with me to dine?"</p>
               <p>"I want Cousin Tommy to come to my party, papa. Tell him to come, please, and
                  Sunshine's love."</p>
               <p>"Your party, chick? Why! he would be Gulliver among the Liliputians. He would
                  tread on a dozen of the guests at the first step, and never know it."</p>
               <p>"I don't think he would, papa; and he's my little wife, and I want him," persisted
                  'Toinette.</p>
               <p>"No, no, dear," interposed Mrs. Legrange. "Cousin Tom wouldn't want to come, and
                  my little girl mustn't tease."</p>
               <p>"No, mamma; but he's my little wife," murmured 'Toinette, going back to her
                  bracelets with a shadow of disappointment in the curve of her pretty mouth.</p>
               <p>"If mamma is willing, I will ask Cousin Tom, and he can do as he likes about
                  accepting," said the fond father, watching his Sunshine's face.</p>
               <p>Mamma smiled roguishly, murmuring,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'So long as a woman's possessed of a tear,</l>
                        <l>She'll always have her own way;'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> and then, added aloud,—</p>
               <p>"Just as you like, of course, papa; but here is Susan, ready to take 'Toinette for
                  her walk."</p>
               <p>The dining-room door opened softly, and a fresh, pretty-looking nursery-maid
                  stepped in, saying</p>
               <p>"Is Miss 'Toinette ready to come up stairs, ma'am?"</p>
               <p>Yes, Susan. You may take the bracelets, pet; but, when you go out, leave them in
                  the drawer of your bureau."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mamma. Good-by, mamma and papa; and don't forget my little wife, papa."</p>
               <p>"I won't forget, Sunshine," said Mr. Legrange, laughing, as he followed the child
                  and nurse to the door, and watched them up stairs.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE LITTLE WIFE.</head>
               <p>THREE o'clock came at last, although 'Toinette had become fully persuaded it never
                  would; and the little guests arrived as punctually as juvenile guests are apt to
                  arrive. Later on in life, people either expect less pleasure from meeting each
                  other, or are more willing to defer securing it; or perhaps it is that they are
                  willing to allow their friends the first chance of appropriating the happiness in
                  store for all. If none of these, what is the reason, children, that, at grown
                  parties, the struggle is to see who shall arrive last, while at ours it is to see
                  who shall come first?</p>
               <p>'Toinette was dressed, and in the drawing-room ready to receive her little
                  friends, by half-past two; and very nice she looked in her light-blue merino
                  frock, with its pretty embroideries, her long golden hair curled in the feathery
                  ringlets Susan was so proud of making, her sleeves looped up with new bracelets,
                  and a little embroidered handkerchief just peeping out of her pockets</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange, who sat reading by the fire, watched with some amusement and more
                  anxiety the movements of the little beauty, who walked slowly up and down the
                  room, twisting her head to look now at one shoulder and now at the other, now at
                  the flow of her skirts behind, and now at the dainty fit of her bronze cloth
                  gaiter-boots. At last, stopping before the long mirror, Miss 'Toinette began
                  practicing the courtesy she had learned at dancing-school, finishing by throwing a
                  kiss from the tips of her fingers to the graceful little shadow in the mirror.</p>
               <p>"She will be spoiled, entirely spoiled, before she is a year older," thought the
                  mother anxiously. "She is so beautiful! and every one tells her of it. What shall
                  I do?"</p>
               <p>But sometimes, when our task seems too difficult for us, God takes it into his own
                  hand, and does it in his own way, though that way to us be strange and
                  painful.</p>
               <p>While Mrs. Legrange still hesitated whether to speak, and what to say, the
                  doorbell rang, and 'Toinette rushed away to meet her friends, and take them to the
                  dressing room, where they were to leave their outside garments; and the mother
                  laid aside her book, and prepared to help in entertaining the little people.</p>
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5676-00000011"/>
               <p>Another ring at the bell; another troop of little feet, and peal of merry voices;
                  another and another; and, following the last, a firmer step upon the stair, and
                  the appearance in the drawing-room of a tall, fine-looking young man, of twenty
                  two or three years old, who came forward, offering his hand to Mrs. Legrange.</p>
               <p>"Why, Tom," said she, "did you really come?"</p>
               <p>"As you see, Cousin Fanny. Paul gave me the invitation, with my little wife's
                  love; and how could I decline?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure it is very good of you to come and help entertain; but I am afraid it
                  will be a sad bore. Miss Minnie Wall, the oldest of the young ladies, is but just
                  fourteen; and Bessie Rider, the youngest, is not yet six."</p>
               <p>"But I came to visit my little wife," persisted Mr. Burroughs, laughing gayly.</p>
               <p>"Here she is, then, with all the rest behind her;" and, as the little hostess
                  caught sight of her new guest, she flew toward him, crying,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, my little wife has come!—my little, wife!"</p>
               <p>Every one laughed, except the young man thus oddly addressed, who gravely extended
                  his hand, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Miss 'Toinette, allow me to wish you many happy returns of this fortunate
                  day."</p>
               <p>'Toinette looked at him a moment in surprise, then, glancing at the other guests,
                  said innocently,—</p>
               <p>"I guess you talk that way because the girls are here; but I like the way you are
                  always, best." </p>
               <p>This time Tom laughed as loud as the rest, and, catching the child in his arms,
                  kissed her a dozen times, saying,—</p>
               <p>"That is it, Sunshine. Let us be natural, and have a good time. Get the
                  table-cloth, and make an elephant of me."</p>

               <p>"LET us have a dance!" exclaimed Minnie Wall, when all the games had been played,
                  and the little people stood for a moment, wondering what they should do next.</p>
               <p>"O Mrs. Legrange! will you play for us?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly. What will you have, Minnie? But, in the first place, can you all
                  dance?"</p>
               <p>"Yes'm, every one of us. Even 'Toinette and Bessie have learned at their
                  Kindergarten; and the rest of us all go to Mr. Papanti. O Mrs. Legrange! last
                  Saturday, when you let Susan bring 'Toinette to dancing-school, I told Mr. Papanti
                  what a pretty little dancer she was; and he made her stand up, and she learned the
                  cachuca with half a dozen others of us; and he did laugh and bow so at her, you
                  never saw; and he called her <hi rend="i"/>enfant Cherrytoe, or something like
                  that"—</p>
               <p>"Cerito," suggested Mrs. Legrange, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Yes'm, I guess that was it; and she learned it beautifully. Have you seen her
                  dance it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, the old gentleman called me Cherrytoe; and you must, mamma, and every one,
                  because I dance so pretty, with my little toes. Will you call me Cherrytoe always,
                  mamma?" asked 'Toinette, with such a complacent delight in her own
                  accomplishments, that her mother's smile was sad as it was tender. But she felt
                  that this was not the time or place to reprove the vanity so rankly springing in
                  the child's heart; so she only said,—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Papanti was in fun when he called you Cherrytoe, darling. She was a woman who
                  danced better than I hope you ever will. Now, who is ready for Virginia reel?"</p>
               <p>Tom Burroughs led Minnie Wall to the head of the set, other children rushed for
                  places, Mrs. Legrange seated herself at the piano, and the merry dance went on;
                  but, when it was over, Minnie Wall returned to Mrs. Legrange's side, followed by
                  two or three more, begging her to play the cachuca, and see how nicely 'Toinette
                  could dance it. Half unwillingly the mother complied, and found really astonished
                  as she noticed the graceful evolutions and accurate time of the child, who went
                  through the intricate motions of the dance without a single mistake, and, at the
                  close, dropped her little courtesy, and kissed her little hand, with the grace and
                  self-possession of a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">danseuse</foreign>.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5676-00000013"/>
               <p>The children crowded around her with a clamor of delight and surprise; but the
                  mother, anxiously watching her darling's flushed face and sparkling eyes,
                  whispered to her cousin, as he playfully applauded,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't, Tom! The child will be utterly ruined by so much flattery and
                  admiration. I feel very badly about it, I assure you."</p>
               <p>"But she is absolutely so bewitching! How can we help admiring her?" replied he,
                  laughing.</p>
               <p>"No: but it is wrong; it won't do," persisted Mrs. Legrange. "Just see how excited
                  and happy she looks because they are all admiring her! You must help me to check
                  it, Tom. Come, you are so famous for stories, tell them one about a peacock, or
                  something,—a story with a moral about being vain, you know, only not too
                  pointed."</p>
               <p>"A pill with a very thick sugar-coat," suggested Mr. Burroughs, and, as his cousin
                  nodded, continued, in a louder voice,—</p>
               <p>"A story, ladies and gentlemen! Who will listen to the humble attempts of an
                  unfortunate improvisator?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, a story; let us have a story!" shouted with one accord both girls and
                  boys; and with 'Toinette perched upon his knee, and the rest grouped about him,
                  Cousin Tom began the story of <title>THE CHILDREN OF MERRIGOLAND.</title>

               <head type="sub">THE CHILDREN OF MERRIGOLAND.</head>
               <p>ONCE upon a time, in the pleasant country of Merrigoland, all the fathers and
                  mothers, the uncles and aunts, the grandpas and grandmas, in fact, all the
                  grown-up people of every sort, were invited to the governor's house to spend a
                  week; and all the cooks and chambermaids, and nurses and waiters, and coachmen and
                  gardeners, in Merrigoland, were invited to go and wait upon them: so there was
                  nobody left at home in any of the houses but the children; not even the babies;
                  for their mothers had carried them in their arms to the governor's house.</p>
               <p>"What fun!" shouted the children. "We can do every thing we have a mind to
                  now."</p>
               <p>"We'll eat all the cake and pies and preserves and candies in the country," said
                  Patty Pettitoes.</p>
               <p>"We'll swing on all the gates, and climb all the cherry-trees, and chase all the
                  roosters, and play ball against the parlor-windows," said Tom Tearcoat.</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5676-00000014"/>
               <p>"We'll lie down on the sofas, and read stories all day, and go to sleep before the
                  fire at night," said Dowsabelle Dormouse.</p>
               <p>"We'll dress up in all our mothers' clothes, and put on their rings and
                  breastpins," said little Finnikin Fine, pushing a chair in front of the
                  looking-glass, and climbing up to look at herself.</p>
               <p>"We'll get our stockings dirty, and tear our frocks, and tumble our hair, and not
                  wash our hands at dinner-time, nor put on our eating-aprons," said Georgie
                  Tearcoat, Tom's younger sister.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes: we'll all do just as we like best for a whole week; for father and
                  mother said we might!" shouted all the children in Merrigoland, and then laughed
                  so loud, that the mice ran out of their holes to see what was the matter; and the
                  cats never noticed them, they were so busy sticking the hair straight up on their
                  backs, and making their tails look like chimney-brushes; while all the birds in
                  the pleasant gardens of Merrigoland fluttered their wings, and sung,— <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Only listen to the row!</l>
                        <l>What in the world's the matter now?</l>
                        <l>Tweet, tweet! Can't sing a note;</l>
                        <l>My heart's just jumping out of my throat.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Bobolink, bobolink,</l>
                        <l>What do you think?</l>
                        <l>Is the world very glad,</l>
                        <l>Or has it gone mad?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So the children all did what they liked best, and frolicked in the sunshine like a
                  swarm of butterflies, or like several hundred little kittens, until it came night;
                  and then they went into the houses, and put themselves to bed. But some of them, I
                  am afraid, forgot to say their prayers when their mammas were not there to remind
                  them of it.</p>
               <p>The next morning they all jumped up, and dressed very gayly (for children do not
                  often lie in bed), and came down to breakfast: but, lo and behold! there was no
                  breakfast ready, nor even any fire in the ranges and cooking-stoves, and in some
                  houses not even any shavings and kindling wood to make a fire; and the cows, who
                  were mostly of a Scotch breed, came to the bars, calling,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Moo, moo, moo!</l>
                        <l>Who'll milk us noo?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> and the hens all stuck their heads through the bars of the poultry-yard
                  fence, and cried,— <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Kah-dah-cut, kah-dah-cut!</l>
                        <l>Are you having your hair cut?</l>
                        <l>Can you give us some corn</l>
                        <l>This beautiful morn?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5676-00000015"/> and the pigeons came flying down to the
                  back door, murmuring,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Coo, coo, coo!</l>
                        <l>Must we breakfast on dew?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> and all the little children began to cry as loud as they could, and call,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Mamma, mamma, mamma!</l>
                        <l>I want you and papa!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So, altogether, the older children were just about crazy, and felt as if they'd
                  like to cry too. But that never would do, of course; for nobody cries when old
                  enough to know better: so after running round to each others' houses, and talking
                  a little, they agreed they would all work together, and that every one should do
                  what he could do best. So Tom Tearcoat, instead of climbing trees, and smashing
                  the furniture with his hatchet, went and split kindlings in all the wood-houses;
                  and his sister Georgie, who never wanted to be in the house, carried them into the
                  kitchens; and Patty Pettitoes tried her hand at cooking, instead of eating; and
                  Dowsabelle Dormouse made the beds, and beat up the sofa-pillows; and Mattie
                  Motherly, whose chief delight was playing at housekeeping in her baby-house, set
                  the tables, and put the parlors to rights. But there seemed to be nothing that
                  Finnikin Fine could do; for she had never thought of any thing but dressing, in
                  all the gay clothes she could get, and looking into the mirror until she had worn
                  quite a place in the carpet before it. But, at last, someone said,—</p>
               <p>"Oh! Finnikin may dress the little children: that will suit her best."</p>
               <p>So Finnikin tried to do that. But she spent so much time tying up the little
                  girls' sleeves with ribbons, and parting the little boys' hair behind, that, when
                  breakfast-time came, they were not half ready, and began to cry,— <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>O Finnikin, O!</l>
                        <l>Don't spend your time so,</l>
                        <l>But put on our dresses,</l>
                        <l>And smooth out our tresses;</l>
                        <l>We don't care for curls,</l>
                        <l>Either boys or girls,</l>
                        <l>If we are but neat,</l>
                        <l>And may sit down to eat."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So at last Finnikin followed their advice, and, when she had dressed all the
                  children, was so tired and hungry, that she was glad to sit down and eat her
                  breakfast without even looking in the mirror once while she was at table.</p>
               <p>But nobody knew how to milk the cows; and, although<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000016"/> Tom and Georgie Tearcoat tried with all their
                  might, they could not manage to get a drop of milk from one of them, and no one
                  else even tried. But, just as the children were all wondering what they should do,
                  little Peter Phinn, who had been listening and looking, with his hands in the
                  pockets of his ragged trousers, and a broad grin on his freckled face, said
                  slowly,—</p>
               <p>"I know how to milk."</p>
               <p>"You do! Why didn't you say so, Peter Phinn?" cried all the children angrily.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I didn't know as you'd want me and Merry amongst you," said Peter.</p>
               <p>"Why not? Of course we do," said Patty Pettitoes, who was a very good-natured
                  little girl.</p>
               <p>"Because Finnikin Fine told Merry once she wasn't fit to play with her, when her
                  clothes was so poor," said Peter.</p>
               <p>"Did Finnikin say that?" asked Patty.</p>
               <p>"Yes, she did, sure; and she called her a little Paddy, and said, if she wore such
                  an old, mean gown and bonnet, she'd ought to keep out of the way of folks that
                  dressed nicer, as she did."</p>
               <p>Then all the children turned and looked at Finnikin Fine, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, shame, Finnikin! for shame to talk so to good little Merry Phinn!"</p>
               <p>Then Finnikin hung down her head, and blushed very much, and began to cry; but
                  Merry Phinn went close to her, and whispered,—</p>
               <p>"Never mind them, honey. I'll forget it sooner than you will, and I'll come and
                  help you dress the children tomorrow morning."</p>
               <p>"And I'll give you my new pink muslin, and my white beads, and my bronze slippers
                  with pink rosettes, and, and," began Finnikin; but Merry put her little brown hand
                  over her mouth, and said, laughing,—</p>
               <p>"And, if I get all these fine things, I'd be as bad as yourself, Finny darling.
                  No: I'll wear my calico gown, and my sun-bonnet, and my strong shoes; and you'll
                  see I can get to my work or my play without half the bother you'd make in your
                  finery."</p>
               <p>So Finnikin, still blushing, and crying a little, put her arm round Merry's neck,
                  and kissed her; and then she ran and took off the rinses and pins and ribbons and
                  flowers she had found time since breakfast to put on, and changed her blue silk
                  dress for a neat gingham and a white apron, and put her hair into a net, instead
                  of the wreath and curls it<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5676-00000017"/> had cost her
                  so much trouble to arrange. And, when she came down stairs again, all the children
                  cried,—</p>
               <p>"Only see how pretty Finnikin Fine is in her plain dress! She looks like a little
                  girl now, instead of a wax doll in a toy-shop window."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Tom Tearcoat; "and a fellow could play with her now in some comfort.
                  It used to be,—</p>
               <p>"'Dear me, you rude boy! you've gone and torn my flounce!' or, 'You've spoilt my
                  bow!' or, 'Dear me, you troublesome creature! you've made me so nervous!'"</p>
               <p>Every one laughed to hear Tom mimic Finnikin, he did it so well; but, when they
                  saw that the little girl herself was troubled by it, they left off directly, and
                  began to talk of other things; and Tom came and tucked a big green apple into her
                  pocket, and a lump of maple-sugar into her hand.</p>
               <p>Then Peter and Merry, who had always been used to waiting upon themselves, and
                  doing all the work they were able to do, showed the other children many things
                  which they needed to know, and helped them in so many ways, that the troubles of
                  the morning were soon forgotten; and when, after clearing away the dinner, the
                  little people all came out to play upon the green, they agreed to crown Peter and
                  Merry King, and Queen of Merrigoland from three o'clock in the afternoon until
                  sunset, because they were the only boy and girl in all the land who knew how to do
                  the work that must every day be done to make us all comfortable. But Peter and
                  Merry, who were very sensible as well as very good-natured children, said,—</p>
               <p>"No, no, no! There shall be no kings or queens in Merrigoland. We will teach you
                  all that we know, and you shall teach us all that you know, and so we will help
                  each other; and no one shall think himself better than any one else, or forget
                  that none of us can do well without the help of all the rest."</p>
               <p>So the children shouted,—</p>
               <p>"Hurrah for Peter and Merry, and down with fine ways and fine clothes!"</p>
               <p>And then they gave three cheers so loud, that the fathers and mothers, and
                  grandpas and grandmas, and uncles and aunts, and brothers and sisters, heard them,
                  as they sat at dinner in the governor's house; and all came trooping home in a
                  great hurry to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>But when they heard the story, and found how well the children were going on, they
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"We could teach them nothing better than what they are learning for themselves. We
                  may let them alone."</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5676-00000018"/>
               <p>So they all went back to the governor's house, and spent the rest of the week,
                  and"—</p>
               <p>"Tea is ready, Mrs. Legrange," said James at the parlor-door.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE RUNAWAY.</head>
               <p>TEA was over, and the little guests made ready to go home. Cousin Tom, declining
                  Mrs. Legrange's invitation to dinner on plea of another engagement, delighted Miss
                  Minnie Wall's heart by offering to wait upon her home, but rather injured the
                  effect of his politeness by taking Willy and Jerry Noble upon the other side, and
                  talking pegtop with them as glibly as he talked opera with the young lady.</p>
               <p>As for the rest, some went alone, some with their nurses, some with each other.
                  Little Bessie Rider was the last; and, when the nurse did not come for her as had
                  been promised, Mrs. Legrange bid Susan lead her home, leaving 'Toinette in the
                  drawing-room till her return.</p>
               <p>"And I must go and lie down a little before I dress for dinner," continued she to
                  'Toinette. "So, Sunshine, I shall leave you here alone, if you will promise not to
                  touch anything you should not, or to go too near the fire."</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5676-00000019"/>
               <p>The little girl promised; and, with a lingering kiss, her mother left her.</p>
               <p>Alone in the twilight, 'Toinette sat for a while upon the rug, watching the bright
                  coals as they tinkled through the grate, or rushed in roaring flame up the
                  chimney.</p>
               <p>"I wish I was a fire-fairy, and lived in that big red hole right in the middle of
                  the fire," thought 'Toinette. "Then I would wear such a beautiful dress just like
                  gold, and a wreath on my head all blazing with fire; and I would dance a-tiptoe
                  away up the chimney and into the sky: and perhaps I should come to heaven; no, to
                  the sun. I wonder if the sun is heaven for the fire-fairies, and I wonder if they
                  dance in the sunset."</p>
               <p>So 'Toinette jumped up, and, running to one of the long windows, put her little
                  eager face close to the glass, and looked far away across the square, and down the
                  long street beyond, to the beautiful western sky, all rosy and golden and purple
                  with the sunset-clouds; while just above them a great white star stood trembling
                  in the deep blue, as if frightened at finding itself out all alone in the
                  night.</p>
               <p>"No," thought 'Toinette; "I don't want to be a fire-fairy, and dance in the
                  sunset: I want to be a—a angel, I guess, and live in that beautiful star. Then I'd
                  have a dress all white and shining like mamma's that she wore to the ball. But
                  mamma said the little girl in the story was naughty to like her pretty dress, and
                  she weared a gingham one when she was good. Guess I won't be any fairy. I'll be
                  Finnikin Fine, and wear a gingham gown and apron. I'll tell papa to carry away the
                  bracelets too. I'm going to be good like Merry that weared a sun-bonnet."</p>
               <p>Eager to commence the proposed reform, 'Toinette tugged at the bracelet upon her
                  left shoulder until she broke the clasp and tore the pretty lace of her
                  under-sleeve.</p>
               <p>"Dear, dear, what a careless child!" exclaimed the little girl, remembering the
                  phrase so often repeated to her. "But it ain't any matter, I guess," added she,
                  brightening up; for I shan't have any under-sleeve to my gingham dress. Susan's
                  aunt doesn't."</p>
               <p>'Toinette paused, with her hand upon the other bracelet trying to remember whether
                  Susan, or the little girl who came to see her, was the aunt. The question was not
                  settled, when the sound of music in the street below attracted 'Toinette's
                  attention. Clinging to the window-ledge so as to see over the iron railing of the
                  balcony, she peeped down, and saw a small dark man walking slowly by the house,
                  turning the crank of a hand-organ which he carried<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000020"/> at his side. Upon the organ was perched a monkey,
                  dressed in a red coat with gilt buttons, a little cocked hat, and blue trousers.
                  He was busily eating a seed-cake; pausing now and then to look about him in a sort
                  of anxious way, chattering all the while as if he thought some one wanted to take
                  it away from him.</p>
               <p>'Toinette had never before seen a monkey; and she stared at this one in great
                  surprise and delight, taking him for a little man, and his inarticulate chattering
                  for words in some foreign language such as she had sometimes heard spoken.</p>
               <p>The music also suited the little girl's ear better than the best strains of the
                  Italian opera would have done; and altogether she was resolved to see and hear
                  more both of the monkey and the music.</p>
               <p>"Mamma's asleep, and Susan gone out; so I can't ask leave, but I'll only stay a
                  little tiny minute, and tell the little man what is his name, and what he is
                  saying," reasoned the pretty runaway, primly wrapping herself in her mother's
                  breakfast-shawl left lying upon the sofa, and tying her handkerchief over her
                  head.</p>
               <p>"Now I's decent, and the cold won't catch me," murmured she, regarding herself in
                  the mirror with much satisfaction, and then running softly down stairs. Susan,
                  thinking she should be back directly, had left the catch-latch of the front-door
                  fastened up: so 'Toinette had only to turn the great silver handle of the other
                  latch; and this, by putting both hands to it and using all her strength, she
                  finally succeeded in doing, although she could not close the door behind her.
                  Leaving it ajar, 'Toinette ran down the steps, and looked eagerly along the square
                  until she discovered the hand-organ man with his monkey just turning the corner,
                  and flew after him as fast as her little feet would carry her. But, with all her
                  haste, the man had already turned another corner before she overtook him, and was
                  walking, more quickly than he had yet done, down a narrow street. He was not
                  playing now; but the monkey, who had finished his cake, was climbing over his
                  master's shoulders, running down his arms and back, chattering, grinning, making
                  faces, and evidently having a little game of romps on his own account.</p>
               <p>'Toinette, very much amused, tripped along behind, talking as fast as the monkey,
                  and asking all manner of questions, to none of which either monkey or man made any
                  reply; while all the time the beautiful rosy light was fading out of the west, and
                  the streets were growing dark and<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5676-00000021"/>
                  crowded; and as the organ-grinder, followed by 'Toinette, turned from one into
                  another, each was dirtier and narrower and more disagreeable than the last.</p>
               <p>All at once, the man, after hesitating for a moment, dashed across the street, and
                  into a narrow alley opposite. Two or three dirt-carts were passing at the same
                  time; and 'Toinette, afraid to follow, stood upon the edge of the sidewalk,
                  looking wistfully after him, and beginning to wonder if she ought not to be going
                  home.</p>
               <p>While she wondered, a number of rude boys came rushing by; and, either by accident
                  or malice, the largest one, in passing the little girl, pushed her so roughly,
                  that she stumbled off the sidewalk altogether, and fell into the gutter.</p>
               <p>A little hurt, a good deal frightened, and still more indignant, 'Toinette picked
                  herself up, and looked ruefully at the mud upon her pretty dress, but would not
                  allow herself to cry, as she longed to do.</p>
               <p>"If I'd got my gingham dress on, it wouldn't do so much harm," thought she, her
                  mind returning to the story she had that afternoon heard; and then all at once an
                  anxious longing for home and mother seized the little heart, and sent the tiny
                  feet flying up the narrow street as fast as they could move. But, at the corner,
                  'Toinette, who never had seen the street before, took the wrong turn; and,
                  although she ran as fast as she could, every step now led her farther from home,
                  and deeper into the squalid by-streets and alleys, among which she was lost.</p>

               <head type="sub">MOTHER WINCH.</head>
               <p>IN a narrow court, hardly lighted by the one gas-light flaring at its entrance,
                  'Toinette stopped, and, looking dismally about her, began at last to cry. At the
                  sound, a crooked old woman, with a great bag on her back, who had been resting
                  upon the step of a door close by, although the little girl had not noticed her,
                  rose, and came toward her.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, young one?" asked the old woman harshly.</p>
               <p>"I don't know the way home, and I'm lost!" said 'Toinette, wiping her eyes, and
                  looking doubtfully at the old woman, who was very dark and hairy as to the face,
                  very blinking and wicked as to the eyes, and very crooked and warped as to figure,
                  while her dress seemed to be a mass of rags held together by dirt.</p>
               <p>"Lost, be you?" asked this unpleasant old woman, seizing Mrs. Legrange's beautiful
                  breakfast-shawl, and twitching it off the child's shoulders. "And where'd you git
                  this 'ere pretty shawl?"</p>
               <p>"It's my mamma's, and you'd better not touch it; you might soil it, you know,"
                  said 'Toinette anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Heh! Why, I guess you're a little lady, ain't you? B'long to the big-bugs, don't
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know. I want to go home," stammered 'Toinette, perplexed and
                  frightened.</p>
               <p>"Well, you come right in here along o' me, and wait till I get my pack off; then
                  I'll show you the way home," said the woman, as, seizing the little girl's hand,
                  she led her to the bottom of the court, and down some steps into a foul-smelling
                  cellar-room, perfectly dark, and very cold.</p>
               <p>"You stop right there till I get a light," said the woman, letting go the child's
                  hand when they reached the middle of the room. "Don't ye budge now."</p>
               <p>Too much frightened to speak, or even cry, 'Toinette did as she was bid, and stood
                  perfectly still until the old woman had found a match, and, drawing it across the
                  rusty stove, lighted a tallow candle, and stuck it into the mouth of a
                  junk-bottle. This she set upon the table; and, sinking into a chair beside it,
                  stretched out a skinny hand, and, seizing 'Toinette by the arm, dragged her close
                  to her.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you kin let me have that pooty shawl, little gal, cause—Eh, what fine clo'es
                  we've got on!" exclaimed the<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5676-00000023"/> hag, as,
                  pulling off the shawl 'Toinette had again wrapped about her, she examined her
                  dress attentively for a moment, and then, fixing her eyes sternly upon the child,
                  continued angrily,—</p>
               <p>"Now look at here, young un. Them ain't your clo'es; you know they ain't. You
                  stole 'em."</p>
               <p>"Stealed my clothes!" exclaimed 'Toinette in great indignation. "Why, no, I
                  didn't. Mamma gave them to me, and Susan sewed them."</p>
               <p>"No sech a thing, you young liar!" returned the old woman, shaking her roughly by
                  one arm. "You stole 'em; and I'm a-going to take 'em off, and give you back your
                  own, or some jist like 'em. Then I'll carry these fine fixings to the one they
                  b'long to. Come, now, no blubbering. Strip off, I tell yer."</p>
               <p>As she spoke, she twirled the little girl round, and began to pull open the
                  buttons of her dress. In doing this, her attention was attracted by the bracelet
                  looping up the right sleeve; 'Toinette having, it will be remembered, pulled off
                  the other, and left it at home.</p>
               <p>"Hi, hi! What sort o' gimcrack you got here?" exclaimed she, pulling at it, until,
                  as 'Toinette had done with the other, she broke the links between two of the
                  cameos, without unclasping the bracelet.</p>
               <p>"Hi! that's pooty! Now, what a young wretch you be for to go and say that ere's
                  yourn!" added she severely, as she held the trinket out of reach of the little
                  girl, who eagerly cried,—</p>
               <p>"It is, it is mine! Papa gave me both of them, 'cause it's my birthday. They're my
                  bracelets; only mamma said I was too little to wear them on my arms like she does,
                  and she tied up my sleeves with them."</p>
               <p>"Where's t'other one, then?"</p>
               <p>"It's at home. I pulled it off 'cause I was going to be like Merry, that weared a
                  sun-bonnet, and didn't have any bracelets."</p>
               <p>"Sun-bonnet! What d'ye want of a sun-bonnet, weather like this? I'll give you my
                  old hood; that's more like it, I reckon," replied the hag, amused, in spite of
                  herself, by the prattle of the child. 'Toinette hesitated.</p>
               <p>"No," said she at last: "I guess you'd better give me my own very clo'ses, and
                  carry me home. Then mamma will give me a gingham dress and a sun-bonnet; and maybe
                  she'll give you my pretty things, if you want them."</p>
               <p>"Thanky for nothing, miss. I reckon it'll be a saving of trouble to take em now. I
                  don't b'lieve a word about your ma'am giving 'em to you; and, more'n all, I don't
                  b'lieve you've got no ma'am."</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5676-00000024"/>
               <p>So saying, she rudely stripped off, first the dress, then the underclothes, and
                  finally even the, stockings and pretty gaiter-boots; so that the poor child,
                  frightened, ashamed, and angry, stood at last with no covering but the long
                  ringlets of her golden hair, which, as she, sobbing, hid her face in her hands,
                  fell about her like a veil.</p>
               <p>Leaving her thus, the old woman rummaged for a few moments in a heap of clothes
                  thrown into the corner of the room,—the result, apparently, of many a day's
                  begging or theft. From them she presently produced a child's nightgown, petticoat,
                  and woollen skirt, a pair of coarse shoes much worn, and an old plaid shawl: with
                  these she approached 'Toinette.</p>
               <p>"See! I've got your own clo'es here all ready for you. Ain't I good?"</p>
               <p>"They ain't my clothes: I won't have 'em on. Go away, you naughty lady, you ain't
                  good a bit!" screamed 'Toinette, passionately striking at the clothes and the hand
                  that held them.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, miss, none o' them airs! Take that, now, and mend your manners!"
                  exclaimed the old woman with a blow upon the bare white shoulder, which left the
                  print of all her horny fingers. It was the first time in all her life that
                  'Toinette had been struck; and the blood rushed to her face, and then away,
                  leaving her as white as marble. She cried no more, but, fixing her eyes upon the
                  face of the old woman, said solemnly,—</p>
               <p>"Now the Lord doesn't love you. Did you know it was the bad spirits that made you
                  strike me? Mamma said so when I struck Susan."</p>
               <p>"Shut up! I don't want none of your preaching, miss," replied the woman angrily.
                  "Here, put on these duds about the quickest, or I'll give you worse than that.
                  Lor, what a mess of hair! What's the good on't? Maybe, though, they'd give some'at
                  for it to the store."</p>
               <p>She took a large pair of shears from the table-drawer as she spoke, and, grasping
                  the shining, curls in her left hand, rapidly snipped them from the head, leaving
                  it rough, tangled, and hardly to be recognized.</p>
               <p>'Toinette no longer resisted, or even cried. The blow of that rough hand seemed to
                  have stunned or stupefied her, and she stood perfectly quiet, her face pale, her
                  eyes fixed, and her trembling lips a little apart; while the old woman, after
                  laying the handful of curls carefully aside, dragged on the clothes she had
                  selected, in place of those she was stealing, and finished by trying the plaid
                  shawl around the child's<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5676-00000025"/> shoulders,
                  fastening it in a great knot behind, and placing a dirty old hood upon the shorn
                  head.</p>
               <p>"There, now, you'll do, I guess; and we'll go take you home: only mind you don't
                  speak a word to man, woman, nor child, as we go; for, if you do, I'll fetch you
                  right back here, and shut you up with Old Bogy in that closet."</p>
               <p>So saying, she bundled up 'Toinette's own clothes, slipped the bracelet into her
                  pocket, then, with the parcel in one hand, grasped the child's arm with the other,
                  and led her out into the street.</p>
               <p>"Will you really take me home?" asked 'Toinette piteously, as they climbed the
                  broken steps leading from the cellar to the pavement.</p>
               <p>"There, now! What did I tell yer?" exclaimed the woman angrily, and turning as if
                  to go back. "Now come along, and I will give you to Old Bogy."</p>
               <p>"No, no! oh, please, don't! I will be good. I won't say a word any more. I
                  forgotten that time, I did;" and the timid child, pale and trembling, clung to the
                  wretch beside her as if she had been her dearest friend.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, don't go into fits, and I'll let you off this time; but see that you
                  don't open your head agin, or it'll be all up with yer."</p>
               <p>"Yes'm," said the poor child submissively; and, taking her once more by the hand,
                  the old woman led her rapidly along the filthy street, now entirely dark except
                  for the gaslights, and more strange to 'Toinette's eyes than Fairy-land would have
                  been. As they turned the corner, a tall, broad-shouldered man, dressed in a blue
                  coat with brass buttons, and a glazed cap, who stood leaning against the wall,
                  looked sharply at them, and called out,</p>
               <p>"Hullo, Mother Winch! What's up to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, yer honor,—nothing at all. Me and little Biddy Mahoney's going to leave
                  some duds at the pawnbroker's for her mother, who's most dead with the fever."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, go along; only look out you carry no more than you honestly come by,"
                  said the policeman, walking leisurely up the street.</p>
               <p>Mother Winch turned in the opposite direction, and, still tightly grasping
                  'Toinette's arm, led her through one street after another, until, tired and
                  bewildered, the poor child clung with half-closed eyes to the filthy skirts of the
                  old woman, and stumbled along, neither seeing nor knowing which way they went.</p>
               <p>"Hold up, can't ye, gal!" exclaimed Mother Winch, as the child tripped, and nearly
                  fell. "Or, if you're so<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5676-00000026"/> tired as all
                  that, set down on that door-stone, and wait for me a minute." Pushing her down
                  upon the step as she spoke, Mother Winch hurried away so fast, that, before
                  'Toinette's tired little brain could fairly understand what was said, she found
                  herself alone, with no creature in sight all up and down the narrow street, except
                  a cross-looking dog walking slowly along the pavement toward her. For one moment,
                  she sat wondering what she had better do; and then, as the cross-looking dog fixed
                  his eyes upon her with a sullen growl, she started to her feet, and ran as fast as
                  she could in the direction taken by Mother Winch. Just at the corner of the alley,
                  something glittering upon the sidewalk attracted her attention; and, stooping to
                  pick it up, she uttered a little cry of surprise and pleasure. It was her own
                  coral bracelet, which had traveled round in Mother Winch's pocket until it came to
                  a hole in the bottom, and quietly slipping out, and down her skirts to the
                  pavement, lay waiting for its little mistress to pick it up.</p>
               <p>'Toinette kissed it again and again, not because it was a bracelet but because her
                  father had given it to her; and it seemed somehow to take her back a little way
                  toward him and home. It must have been this she meant, in saying as she did,—</p>
               <p>"I guess you have come after me, pretty bracelet, hasn't you? and we'll go home
                  together."</p>
               <p>And so, hugging the toy as close to her heart as she would have liked herself to
                  be hugged to her mother's heart, 'Toinette wandered on and on through the dark and
                  lonely streets, her little face growing paler and paler, her little feet more and
                  more weary, her heart swelling fuller and fuller with fright and desolation; until
                  at last, stopping suddenly, she looked up at the sky, all alive now with the
                  crowding stars, and with a great sob whispered,—</p>
               <p>"Pretty stars, please tell God I'm lost. I think he doesn't know about it, or he'd
                  send me home."</p>
               <p>And then, as the wild sob brought another and another, 'Toinette sank down in the
                  doorway of a deserted house, and, covering her face with her hands, cried as she
                  had never cried in all her little life.</p>

               <head type="sub">TEDDY'S LITTLE SISTER.</head>
               <p>"THERE, honey!" said Mrs. Ginniss, giving the last rub to the shirt-bosom she was
                  polishing, and setting her flat-iron back on the stove with a smack,—"there,
                  honey; and I couldn't have done better by that buzzum if ye'd been the
                  Prisidint."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss was alone, so that one might at first have been a little puzzled to
                  know whom she addressed as "honey;" but as she continued to talk while unfolding
                  another shirt, and laying it upon her ironing-board, it became evident that she
                  was addressing the absent owner of the garments.</p>
               <p>"And sure it's many a maner man they've made their prisidints out on, and sorra a
                  better one they'd find betune here and Canady. It's yees that have the free hand
                  and the kind way wid yees, for all your grand looks. The good Lord save and keep
                  ye all the days of yer life!"</p>
               <p>A wrinkle in the wristband here absorbed the attention of the laundress; and,
                  while smoothing it out, she forgot to continue what she had been saying, but, as
                  she once more ironed briskly upon the sleeve, began upon a new subject.</p>
               <p>"And it's late ye're agin, Teddy Ginniss, bad 'cess to yees! And thin it's mesilf
                  that should take shame for saying it; for niver a b'y of them all is so good to
                  his ould mother, and niver a one of 'em all that his mother's got so good a right
                  to be proud on, as Ted. But where is the cratur? His supper's cowld as charity wid
                  stannin."</p>
               <p>At this moment a heavy step was heard upon the stairs, as of some one climbing
                  slowly up with a heavy burden in his arms. Mrs. Ginniss paused to listen, holding
                  the iron suspended over the collar she had just smoothed ready for it.</p>
               <p>"Murther an' all!" muttered she. "And what's the crather got wid him anyhow? Shure
                  an it's him; for, if it wor Jovarny with his orgin, he'd ha' stopped below."</p>
               <p>The heavy steps reached the top of the stairs as she spoke, and clumped along the
                  narrow passage to the door of Mrs. Ginniss's garret. She was already holding it
                  open.</p>
               <p>"Teddy, b'y, an' is it yersilf?" asked she, peering out into the darkness.</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother, its meself," panted a boy's voice, as a<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000028"/> stout young fellow, about fifteen years old,
                  staggered into the room, and sank upon a chair.</p>
               <p>"Saints an' angels, child! and what have ye got there?" exclaimed his mother,
                  bending over the something that filled Teddy's arms and lap.</p>
               <p>"It's a little girl, mother; and I'm feared she's dead!" panted Teddy.</p>
               <p>"A little girl, an' she's dead! Oh, wurra, wurra, Teddy Ginniss, that iver I
                  should be own mother to a murderer! An' is it yersilf that kilt the purty
                  darlint?"</p>
               <p>"Meself, mother!" exclaimed the boy indignantly. "Sure and it wasn't; and I
                  wouldn't 'a thought you'd have needed to ask. I found her on a doorstep in
                  Tanner's Court: and first I thought she was asleep, and so I shook her to tell her
                  to go home before the Charley got her; and then, when she wouldn't wake up, I saw
                  she was either fainted or dead; and I fetched her home to you,— and it's you that
                  go for to call me a murtherer! Oh, oh!"</p>
               <p>As he uttered these last sounds, the boy's wide mouth puckered up in a comical
                  look of distress, and he rubbed the cuff of his jacket across his blinking eyes.
                  Mrs. Ginniss gave him a slap, on the shoulder, intended to be playful, but
                  actually heavy enough to have thrown a slighter person out of the chair.</p>
               <p>"Whisht, honey, whisht!" said she. "And it's an ould fool I am wid me fancies an'
                  me frights. But let us looks at the poor little crather ye've brought home to me.
                  Sure and it was like yees, Teddy, b'y."</p>
               <p>As she spoke, she took from Teddy's arms the little lifeless form, with its pale,
                  still face, and laid it gently upon her own bed.</p>
               <p>"Oh thin! an' it's a shame to see the party darlint lay like that and I'm 'feared,
                  unless the breath's in her yet, she's dead intirely," muttered the good woman,
                  rubbing the little hands in her own, and gently feeling for the beating of the
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"Maybe it's only the cold and the hunger that's ailing her, and she'll come to
                  with the fire and vittels. She can have my supper and my breakfast too, and a
                  welcome with it," said Teddy eagerly.</p>
               <p>"The cowld, maybe, it is; for her clothes is nixt to nothing, an' the flesh of
                  her's like a stone wid the freezing: but she's got enough to ate, or she never'd
                  be so round an' plump. It's like she's the child of some beggar-woman that's fed
                  her on broken vittels, an', whin she got tired ov trampin' wid her, jist dropped
                  her on the doorstep where yees got her.—Howly mother! what's this?"</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5676-00000029"/>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss, as she spoke, had taken the little lifeless form upon her lap close
                  to the stove, and was undressing it, when, among the folds of the old shawl
                  crossed over the bosom, she found a bracelet of coral cameos, set in gold, and
                  fastened with a handsome clasp.</p>
               <p>She held it up, stared at it a moment, and then looked anxiously at Teddy.</p>
               <p>"An' where did this splindid armlit come from, Teddy Ginniss?" asked she
                  sharply.</p>
               <p>"Sorra a bit of me knows, thin; an' is it a thafe ye'll be callin' me as well as a
                  murtherer!" exclaimed the boy, falling, in his agitation, into the Irish brogue he
                  was generally so careful to avoid.</p>
               <p>"Whisht, ye spalpeen! an' lave it on the mantletry till we see if the breath's in
                  her yit. Sure an' sich a little crather niver could have stole it."</p>
               <p>Teddy, with an air of dignified resentment, took the bracelet from his mother's
                  hand, and laid it upon the mantlepiece; while Mrs. Ginniss, with a troubled look
                  upon her broad face, finished stripping the little form, and began rubbing it all
                  over with her warm hands.</p>
               <p>"Power some warm wather into the biggest wash-tub, Teddy, an' I'll thry puttin'
                  her in it. It's what the Yankee doctor said to do wid yees, whin yees had fits;
                  an' it niver did no harm, anyways."</p>
               <p>"Is it a fit she's got?" asked Teddy, with a look of awe upon his face.</p>
               <p>"The good Lord knows what's she's got, or who she is. Mabbe the good folk put her
                  where yees got her. Niver a beggar-brat before had a skin so satin-smooth, an'
                  hands an' feet like rose-leaves and milk. An' look how clane she is from head to
                  heel! Niver a corpse ready for the wakin' was nater."</p>
               <p>"The water's ready now," said Teddy, pushing the tub close to his mother's side,
                  and then walking away to the window. For some moments, the gentle plashing of the
                  water was the only sound he heard; but then his mother hastily exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"Glory be to God an' to his saints! The purty crather's alive, and lookin' at me
                  wid the two blue eyes av her like a little angel! Han' me the big tow'l till I rub
                  her dhry."</p>
               <p>Teddy ran with the towel; and as his mother hastily wrapped her little charge in
                  her apron, and reseated herself before the fire, he caught sight of two great
                  bright eyes staring up at him, and joyfully cried,—</p>
               <p>"She's alive, she's alive! and she'll be my little sister, and we'll keep her
                  always, won't we, mother?"</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5676-00000030"/>
               <p>"Wait, thin, till we see if it's here she is in the morning, said his mother
                  mysteriously.</p>
               <p>"And where else would she be, if not here?" asked Teddy in surprise.</p>
               <p>"If it war the good folks<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001"
                     >*</ref> that browt her, it's they that will fetch her away agin 'fore the

               <p>But, in spite of her suspicions, Mrs. Ginniss did all for the little stranger that
                  she could have done for her own child, even to heating and giving to her the
                  cupful of milk reserved for her own "tay" during the next day, and warming her in
                  her own bosom all through the long, cold night.</p>

               <p>"Yis, b'y, she's here; but it's not long she'll be, savin' the mercy o' God. It's

               <p>"The good Lord knows, not the likes of me, Teddy darlint."</p>
               <p>"And you'll keep her, and do for her, mother, won't you?" asked the boy
                  anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Sure and it wouldn't be Judy Ginniss that'd turn out a dying child, let alone

                  kape her," said the Irish woman confidently; and leaving her little moaning,
                  feverish charge dozing uneasily, she rose, and went about the labors of the
                  day.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5676-00000031"/>
               <p>"Here's the masther's shirts done, Teddy; and ye'd betther take thim to his

               <p>"No, no, mother!" exclaimed Teddy eagerly; "I'll be doing no such thing: for it's
                  ourselves wants her, and any thing the master would say would take her away from
                  us. Sure and how often I've said I'd give all ever I had for a little sister to be

                  you, mother?" persisted Teddy.</p>
               <p>"Yis, b'y, if it's yer heart is set on it."</p>
               <p>"It is that, mother; and you're the good mother, and it's I always knowed, I mean
                  knew it. And will I bring home a doctor to the little sister?"</p>
               <p>"No, Teddy; not yit. Faix, an' it's hard enough to live when we're well; but it's
                  too poor intirely we are to be sick. Whin the time cooms to die, it's no
                  doctherin' 'll kape us."</p>
               <p>Teddy looked wistfully at the little burning face upon the coarse, clean pillow:
                  but he knew that what his mother said was true; and, without reply, he took up the
                  parcel of clothes, and left the room.</p>
               <p>All through the long day, Mrs. Ginniss, toiling at her wash-tubs, found a moment
                  here and another there to sit upon the edge of the bed, and smooth her little
                  patient's hair, or moisten her glowing lips and burning forehead, trying at
                  intervals to induce her to speak, if even but one word, in answer to her tender
                  inquiries; but all in vain: for the child already lay in the stupor preceding the
                  delirium of a violent fever, and an occasional moan or sigh was the only sound
                  that escaped her lips.</p>
               <p>Toward night, Teddy, returning home an hour earlier than usual, came bounding up
                  the stairs, two at a time, but, pausing at the door, entered as softly as a
                  cat.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5676-00000032"/>
               <p>"How is the little sister now, mother?" asked he anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Purty nigh as bad as bad can be, Teddy," said his mother sorrowfully, standing
                  aside as she spoke that the boy might see the burning face, dull, half-closed
                  eyes, and blackening lips of the sick child, and touch the little hands feebly
                  plucking at the blanket with fingers that seemed to scorch the boy's healthy skin
                  as he closed them in his palm.</p>
               <p>Teddy looked long and earnestly,—looked up at his mother's sad face, and down
                  again at the "little sister" whom he had taken to his heart when he first took her
                  to his arms; and then, shutting his lips close together, and swallowing hard to
                  keep down the great sob that seemed like to strangle him, he turned, and rushed
                  out of the room. Mrs. Ginniss looked after him, and wiped her eyes.</p>
               <p>"It's the luvin' heart he has, the crather," murmured she. "An' if the baby wor
                  his own sisther, it's no more he could care for her. Sure an' if the Lord spares
                  her to us, it's Teddy's sisther she shall be, forever an' aye, while me two fists
                  hoold out to work fer 'em."</p>
               <p>An hour later, Teddy returned, conducting a stranger. Rushing into the room before
                  him, the boy threw his arms around his mother's neck, and whispered hastily, in
                  his broadest brogue,—</p>
               <p>"It's a docther; an' he'll cure the sisther; an' it's not a cint he'll be afther
                  axin' us: but don't let on that she's not our own."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss rose, and courtesied to the young man, who now followed Teddy into
                  the room, saying pleasantly,—</p>
               <p>"Good evening, ma'am. I am Dr. Wentworth; and I came to see your little girl by
                  request of Teddy here, who said you would like a doctor if you could have one
                  without paying him."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss courtesied again, but with rather a wrathful look at Teddy, as she
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"And it's sorry I am the b'y should be afther beggin' of yees, docther. I thought
                  he'd more sinse than to be axin' yees to give away yer time, that's as good as
                  money to yees."</p>
               <p>"But my time is not as good as money by any means," said Dr. Wentworth, laughing
                  as he took off his hat and coat; "for I have very little to do except to attend
                  patients who cannot give more than their thanks in payment. That is the way we
                  young doctors begin."</p>
               <p>"An' is that so indade! Sure an' 'Meriky's the place fur poor folks quite an'
                  intirely," said Mrs. Ginniss admiringly.</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5676-00000033"/>
               <p>"For some sorts of poor people, and not for others. Unfortunately, bakers,
                  butchers, and tailors do not practise gratuitously; so we poor doctors, lawyers,
                  and parsons have to play give without take," said the young man, warming his hands
                  a moment over the cooking-stove.</p>
               <p>"An' sure it was out of a Protistint Bible that I heard wonst, 'Him as gives to
                  the poor linds to the Lord:' so, in the ind, it's yees that'll come in wid your
                  pockets full, if ye belave yer own Scripter," said Mrs. Ginniss shrewdly.</p>
               <p>The young doctor gave her a sharp glance out of his merry brown eyes, but only
                  answered, as he walked on to the bedside,—</p>
               <p>"You have it there, my friend."</p>
               <p>For several moments, there was silence in the little room while Dr. Wentworth felt
                  his patient's pulse, looked at her tongue, examined her eyes, and passed his hand
                  over the burning skin.</p>
               <p>"H'm! Typhoid, without doubt," said he to himself, and then to Mrs. Ginniss,—</p>
               <p>"Can you tell the probable cause of the child's illness, ma'am? Has she been
                  exposed to any sudden chill, or any long-continued cold or fatigue?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss was about to reply by telling all she knew of the little stranger;
                  but catching Teddy's imploring look, and the gesture with which he seemed to beg
                  her to keep the secret of his "little sister's" sudden adoption, she only
                  answered,—</p>
               <p>"Sure an' it's the cowld she took last night but one is workin' in her."</p>
               <p>"She took cold night before last? How was it?" pursued the doctor.</p>
               <p>"She was out late in the street, sure, an' the clothes she'd got wasn't warm
                  enough," said the washwoman, her eyes still fixed on Teddy, who, from behind the
                  doctor, was making every imploring gesture he could invent to prevent her from
                  telling the whole truth. The doctor did not fail to notice the hesitation and
                  embarrassment of the woman's manner, but remembering what Teddy had told him of
                  his mother's poverty, and her own little betrayal of pride when he first entered,
                  naturally concluded that she was annoyed at having to say that the child had been
                  sent into the street without proper clothing, and forbore to press the
                  question.</p>
               <p>Ah Teddy and Teddy's mother! if you had loved the truth as well as you loved
                  little lost 'Toinette, how much suffering, anxiety, and anguish you would have
                  saved to her and her's!</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5676-00000034"/>
               <p>But the doctor asked no more questions, except such as Mrs. Ginniss could answer
                  without hesitation; and pretty soon went away, promising to come again next day,
                  and taking Teddy with him to the infirmary where medicine is furnished without
                  charge to those unable to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Before the boy returned, 'Toinette had passed from the stupid to the delirious
                  stage of her fever; and all that night, as he woke or dozed in his little closet
                  close beside his mother's door, poor Teddy's heart ached to hear the wild tones of
                  entreaty, of terror, or of anger, proving to his mind that the delicate child he
                  already loved so well had suffered much and deeply, and that at no distant
                  period.</p>
               <p>Toward morning, he dressed, and crept into his mother's room. The washerwoman sat
                  in the clothes she had worn at bed-time, patiently fanning her little charge, and,
                  half asleep herself, murmuring constantly,—</p>
               <p>"Ah thin, honey, whisht, whisht! It's nothin' shall harm ye now, darlint! Asy,
                  now, asy, mavourneen! Whisht, honey, whisht!"</p>
               <p>"Lie down and sleep, mother, and let me sit by her," whispered Teddy in his
                  mother's ear; and, with a nod, the weary woman crept across the foot of the bed,
                  and was asleep in a moment.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE NIGHT-WATCH.</head>
               <p>TEDDY, waving the old palm-leaf fan up and down with as much care as if it had
                  carried the breath of life to his poor little charge, sat for some time very
                  quiet, listening to her wild prattle without trying to interrupt it; until, after
                  lying still for a few moments, she suddenly fixed her eyes upon him, and
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"Oh! you're Peter Phinn, sister to Merry that weared a sun-bonnet, ain't you?"</p>
               <p>The question seemed so conscious and rational, that Teddy answered eagerly,—</p>
               <p>"No, honey; but I'm Teddy Ginniss; and I'm going to be your brother forever and
                  always. What's your name, sissy?"</p>
               <p>"I'm Finny; no, I'm Cherrytoe,—I'm Cherrytoe, that dances. Want to see me dance,
                  Peter?"</p>
               <p>As she spoke, she started up, and would have jumped out of bed; but Teddy laid his
                  hand upon her arm, and said soothingly,—</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5676-00000035"/>
               <p>"No, no, sissy; not now. Another day you shall dance for Teddy, when you're all
                  well. And you mustn't call me Peter, 'cause I'm Teddy."</p>
               <p>"Teddy, Teddy," repeated 'Toinette vaguely, and then, with a sudden shrill laugh,
                  shouted,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief;</l>
                        <l>Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef.'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Guess you're Taffy, ain't you?"</p>
               <p>"No: I'm Teddy. I'm your brother Teddy," repeated the boy patiently; and then, to
                  change the subject, added coaxingly, "And what's the pretty name you called
                  yourself, darlint?"</p>
               <p>"I'm Cherrytoe,—Cherrytoe that dances so pretty. Don't you hear, you great naughty
                  lady?—Cherrytoe, Cherrytoe, Cherrytoe!"</p>
               <p>The wild scream in which the name was repeated woke even tired Mrs. Ginniss, who
                  started upright, crying,—</p>
               <p>"What's it, what's it, Teddy? Ochone! what ails the crather?"</p>
               <p>"It's only her name she's telling, mother; and sure it's a pretty one. It's
                  Cherrytoe."</p>
               <p>"And what sort of a quare name is that for a christened child? Sure we'll call it
                  Cherry; for wunst I heerd of a lady as was called that way," said Mrs.
                  Ginniss.</p>
               <p>"Yes, we'll call her Cherry, little sister Cherry," said Teddy, delighted with the
                  promise implied in his mother's words of keeping the child for her own. "And,
                  mother," added he, "mind you don't be telling the doctor nor any one that she
                  ain't your own, or maybe they'll take her away to the 'sylum or somewheres,
                  whether we'd like it or not: and, if they do, I'll run off to sea; I will, by
                  ginger!"</p>
               <p>"Whisht, thin, with your naughty words, Teddy Ginniss! Didn't I bate ye enough
                  whin ye wor little to shtop ye from swearin'?"</p>
               <p>"Ginger ain't swearing," replied Teddy positively. "I asked the master if it wor,
                  and he said it worn't."</p>
               <p>"Faith, thin, and he says it hisself, I'm thinkin'," half asked the mother, with a
                  shrewd twinkle of her gray eyes. Teddy faltered and blushed, but answered
                  manfully,—</p>
               <p>"No, he don't; and he said it was low and vulgar to talk that way; and I don't,
                  only by times."</p>
               <p>"Well, thin, Teddy, see that yer don't, only thim times whin yer hears the masther
                  do it forninst ye: thin it'll be time enough for ye. And don't ye be forgettin',
                  b'y, that ye're bound to be a gintleman afore ye die. It was what yer poor daddy
                  said when yer wor born, a twelvemonth arter we landed here. 'There, Judy,' says

               <p>"'Troth, thin, Michael alanna, an' it's a bargain,' says I, an', wake as I wor,

                  work it out."</p>
               <p>To this story, familiar as it was, Teddy listened with as much attention as if he
                  had never heard it before, and, when it was ended, said,—</p>
               <p>"And tell about your putting me to the squire, mother."</p>
               <p>"Yis, b'y; an' that wor the biggest bit of loock that iver I wor in yet. Two
                  twelvemonth ago come Christmas it wor, an' iver an' always I had been thinkin'
                  what 'ud I do wid ye nixt, when Ann Dolan towld me how her sisther's son had got a

                  sich, an' wor to have fifty dollars a year, wid the chance ov larnin' what he
                  could out ov all thim big books as does be in sich places. Thin it somehow kim
                  inter my head so sudden like, that it's sartain sure I am it was Michael come out
                  ov glory to whishper it in my ear: 'There's Misther Booros'll mebbe do as much for
                  your Teddy.' I niver spoke the first word to Ann Dolan, but lapped my shawl about
                  me, an' wint out ov her house with no more than, 'God save ye, Ann!' an' twenty
                  minutes later I wor in Misther Booros's office.</p>
               <p>"'Good-evenin', Mrs. Ginniss,' says he, as ginteel as yer plaze. 'An' how is yer
                  health?'</p>
               <p>"'Purty good, thank ye kindly, sir,' says I; 'an' its hopin' you have yours the

               <p>"'Thank you, I am very well; and what can I do for you this evening? Pray, be
                  sated,' says he, laning back in his chair wid sech a rale good-natured smile on
                  the handsome face of him, that I says to myself, 'It's the lucky woman you are,
                  Judy Ginniss, to put yer b'y wid sech a dacent gintleman: an' I smiled to him

                  thin I made bowld to ax him would he take my b'y the same way, on'y I'd like he'd
                  larn more, an' I wouldn't mind the fifty dollars a year, but 'ud kape him mesilf,
                  as I had kep' him since his daddy died, if the wuth uv it might be give him in
                  larnin'."</p>
               <p>"And what did the master say to that, mother?" asked Teddy, with a bright look
                  that showed he foresaw and was pleased with the answer.</p>
               <p>"Sure and he said what a gintleman the likes uv him should say, and said with his
                  own hearty smile that's as good as the goold dollar uv another man,—</p>
               <p>"'My good 'oman,' says he, 'sind along your b'y as soon as you plaze; an' if he's
                  as—as'—what's that agin, Teddy, darlint?"</p>
               <p>"Amberitious," pronounced Teddy with a grand sort of air; "and it means, he told
                  me, wanting to be something more than you wor by nater."</p>
               <p>"Faith, and that's it, Teddy: that's the very moral uv what I wants to see in
                  yees. Well, the masther said if the b'y was as amberitious an' as 'anest as his
                  mother afore him (that's me, yer see, Teddy),"—</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, mother, I know. Well?"</p>
               <p>"That he'd make a man uv him that should be a pride an' a support to the owld age
                  uv me, an' a blissin' to the day I med up my mind to eddicate him. That wor two
                  year ago, Teddy Ginniss; an', so far, hasn' the gintleman done by yees as niver
                  yer own daddy could? Hasn' he put yees to the readin' an' the writin' an' the
                  joggerphy-picters, an' the nate figgers that yees puts on me washin'-bills, till
                  it's proud I am to hand 'em to the gintlefolks, an' say, 'If ye plaze, the figgers
                  is pooty plain. It's me b'y made 'em'? Now till me, Teddy, hasn' the shquire done
                  all this by yees, an' give yees the fifty dollars by the year, all the same as if
                  he give ye nothin' else?"</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5676-00000038"/>
               <p>"He has so, mother."</p>
               <p>"An' whin I wanted to wash for him widout a cint uv charge, an' towld him it was
                  jist foon to rinshe out his bit things, bekase he is that good-natered an' quite
                  that there's niver the fust roobin' to do to 'em, he says,—</p>
               <p>"'An' if I let yees do 'em widout charge, I'd as lieve wear the shirt of Misther
                  Nessus;' an' more by token, Teddy Ginniss, I told ye iver and oft to look in the
                  big books an' see who was Misther Nessus, an' what about his shirt."</p>
               <p>"Faith and ye did, mother; but I never could find him yet. Some day I'll ask the
                  master," said Teddy with a puzzled look.</p>
               <p>"An' so he pays me what I ax, an' it isn' for the likes uv him to be knowin' what
                  the others ud charge; an', whin he gives me forty cints the dozen, he thinks, the
                  poor innercint! that it's mooch as I would ax uv any one. Now, Teddy b'y, isn' all
                  I've towld ye God's truth? and haven't ye heerd it as many times as yees are days
                  owld out uv yer own moother's lips?"</p>
               <p>"Faith and I have, mother."</p>
               <p>"An' wud yer moother till yees a lie, or bid yees do what wasn't plazin' to God,
                  Teddy?"</p>
               <p>"Sure she wouldn't; and I'll lick the first fellow that'll say she would, if he
                  was as big as Goliah in the Bible," said Teddy, doubling up his fist, and nodding
                  fiercely.</p>
               <p>"Thin, Teddy Ginniss, we cooms to this; an' it's not the first time, nor yet the
                  last, we'll coom to it. If iver ye can do yer masther a service, be it big or be
                  it little; if iver the stringth, or the coorage, or the life itself, of yees, or
                  thim as is dear to yees, ud sarve him or plaze him,—I bid yees now to give it him
                  free an' willin' as ye'd give it to God. An' so ye mind me, it's my blissin' an'
                  the blissin' uv yer dead father that's iver wid ye; an' so ye fail me, it's the
                  black curse uv disobedience, an' yer moother's brukken heart, that shall cling to
                  yees for iver and iver, while life shall last. Do ye mind that, b'y?"</p>
               <p>"I mind it, and I'll heed it, mother, as I've promised you before," said Teddy
                  solemnly; and mother and son exchanged as tender and as true a kiss as young
                  Bayard and his lady-mother could have done when she gave him to be a knight and
                  chevalier.</p>
               <p>All through this long conversation, which had been carried on in a low tone of
                  voice, and frequently interrupted when it seemed to disturb her, 'Toinette had
                  slept feverish and restlessly; but as the washwoman crept away to begin<pb
                     n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5676-00000039"/> her daily labors, and Teddy lingered for
                  a moment more to look at the poor little sister whose beauty was to him an
                  ever-new delight, her great blue eyes suddenly opened, and fixed upon him, while
                  with an airy little laugh she said,—</p>
               <p>"We're King and Queen of Merrigoland, Peter; isn't we? Does you love me,
                  Peter?"</p>
               <p>"I couldn't tell how well I love you, Cherry dear; but it's Teddy I am, and not
                  Peter," said the boy, bashfully kissing the little hot hand upon the outside of
                  the bed.</p>
               <p>To his dismay, the delirious child snatched it from him with a wild cry, and burst
                  into a storm of tears and sobs, crying,—</p>
               <p>"Go away, wicked lady! go away, I say! God won't love you when you strike me, you
                  know. He won't: my mamma said so. Oh, oh, oh!"</p>
               <p>Her cries brought Mrs. Ginniss to her side in a moment, who, tenderly soothing
                  her, turned upon Teddy.</p>
               <p>"Bad 'cess to yees, ye spalpeen! An' what ud ye be afther vexin' her for, an' her
                  in a faver? What did yees say to her?"</p>
               <p>"I said my name was Teddy, and not Peter; and then she said I was a lady, and
                  struck her," replied the boy, bewildered, and a little indignant.</p>
               <p>"And sure ye'r Peter or Paul, or Judas hissilf, if so be she likes to call ye so
                  while she's this way; an', if ye shtrike her, it's the weight uv my fist ye'll
                  feel; mind that, young man!—Whisht, thin, darlint! asy, mavourneen!"</p>
               <p>'Toinette, hushed upon the motherly bosom of the good woman, soon ceased her
                  cries, and presently fell again to sleep; while Teddy, with rather an injured look
                  upon his uncouth face, and yet pleased to see the little sister in his mother's
                  arms, crept softly from the room, with his breakfast in his hand.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE EMPTY NEST.</head>
               <p>WHEN Susan returned from carrying Bessie Rider home, she was quite surprised to
                  find the front-door ajar, as she thought she had been sure of latching it in going
                  out; but, without stopping to make any inquiries of the other servants, she ran up
                  the stairs, took off her shawl and hood, and then went to the drawing-room for
                  'Toinette. The room was empty; and Susan at once concluded that Mrs. Legrange had
                  taken the child to her own chamber while she dressed for dinner, as 'Toinette
                  often begged to be present at this ceremony, and was often indulged.</p>
               <p>"I'll just redd<ref rend="super" target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002">*</ref> up
                  the nursery a bit before I fetch her," said Susan, looking round the littered
                  room; and so it was half an hour before she knocked at Mrs. Legrange's
                  chamber-door with, "I came for Miss 'Toinette, ma'am."</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_002">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>Ready.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"Come in, Susan. Miss 'Toinette, did you say? She is down in the drawing-room by
                  herself, and you had better put her to bed at once. She must be very tired."</p>
               <p>Alas! the tender mother little guessed how tired!</p>
               <p>Without reply, Susan closed the door, and ran down stairs; an uneasy feeling
                  creeping over her, although she would not yet confess it even to herself.</p>
               <p>The drawing-room was still empty; but James had lighted the gas and stirred the
                  fire, so that every corner was as light as day. In every window-recess, under
                  every couch and sofa, behind every large chair, even in the closet of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">étagère</foreign>, Susan searched for her little charge, hoping,
                  praying to find her asleep, or roguishly hiding, as she had known her to do
                  before. But all in vain: no merry face, no sunny curls, no laughing eyes, peeped
                  out from recess or corner or hiding place; and Susan's ruddy face grew pale even
                  to the lips.</p>
               <p>She flew to the dining-room, and searched it as narrowly as she had done the
                  drawing-room.</p>
               <p>No: she was not there!</p>
               <p>The library, the bath-room, the chambers, the nursery again, the servants'
                  chambers, the kitchen, laundry, pantries, the very cellar!</p>
               <p>No, no, no! 'Toinette was in none of them. 'Toinette was not in any nook of the
                  whole wide house, that, without her, seemed so empty and desolate.<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000041"/> Standing in one of the upper entries, mute and
                  bewildered, Susan heard a latch-key turn in the front-door lock, and presently Mr.
                  Legrange's pleasant voice speaking in the hall. A sudden hope rushed into Susan's
                  heart. The child might possibly have gone to meet her father, and was now returned
                  with him. She rushed down stairs as fast as her feet could carry her; but in the
                  hall stood only Mr. Legrange, talking to James, who had some message to deliver to
                  him.</p>
               <p>As Susan flew down the stairs, the master turned and looked at her in some
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"Be careful, Susan: you nearly fell then. Is any thing the matter?"</p>
               <p>"Miss 'Toinette, sir: I can't find her, high nor low!" gasped Susan.</p>
               <p>"Can't find her! Good heavens! you don't mean to say she's lost!" exclaimed the
                  father, turning, and staring at the nurse in dismay.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I don't know, sir, I'm sure; but I can't find her," cried Susan, wildly
                  bursting into tears.</p>
               <p>"Where is her mother? Where is Mrs. Legrange, James?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, sir, I'm sure," said the footman blankly.</p>
               <p>"She's in her own room, sir; and I'm afraid to go to tell her, she'll feel that
                  bad. And indeed it wasn't any fault of mine: I only went"—</p>
               <p>"Hush!" exclaimed Mr. Legrange, who had heard his wife close her chamber-door and
                  begin to descend the stairs, and did not wish her to be frightened.</p>
               <p>"Wait here a moment, Susan," added he, and, running up stairs, entered the
                  drawing-room just after his wife, who stood before the fire, looking so pretty and
                  so gay in her blue silk-dress, with a ribbon of the same shade twisted among her
                  golden curls, that her husband shrunk back, dreading to ask the question that must
                  so shock and startle her. But Mrs. Legrange had caught sight of him, and, running
                  to the door, opened it suddenly, crying,—</p>
               <p>"Come in, you silly boy! Are you playing bo-beep? I don't do such things since my
                  daughter is six years old, I would have you to understand."</p>
               <p>Mr. Legrange, forcing a laugh and a careless tone, came forward as she spoke, and,
                  stooping to kiss her, asked,—</p>
               <p>"And where is your daughter, my love?"</p>
               <p>"'Toinette? Oh! I suppose she is with Susan," began Mrs. Legrange carelessly; and
                  then, as something in her husband's voice or manner attracted her attention, she
                  drew back, and hurriedly looked into his face, crying,—</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5676-00000042"/>
               <p>"O Paul! what is it? What has happened? Is 'Toinette hurt? Where is she?"</p>
               <p>"Be quiet, darling; don't be alarmed. Wait till we know more.—Susan, come up
                  here," called Mr. Legrange; and Susan, with her face buried in her apron, and
                  sobbing as if her heart would break, crept timidly up the stairs and into the
                  room.</p>
               <p>At sight of her, Mrs. Legrange turned pale, and clung to her husband for
                  support.</p>
               <p>"O Susan! what is it? Tell me quick!"</p>
               <p>"She's gone, ma'am, and I don't know where!" sobbed the nurse.</p>
               <p>"Gone! What, 'Toinette gone! Lost, do you mean?" cried the mother wildly, while
                  her pale cheeks flushed scarlet, and her soft eyes glittered with terror.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I don't know, ma'am; but I can't find her."</p>
               <p>"Lost! What, 'Toinette lost!" repeated the mother in the same wild tone, and
                  trying to tear herself away from her husband's detaining arms. But, soothing her
                  as he would a child, Mr. Legrange, by a few calm and well-directed questions, drew
                  from both mistress and maid all that was to be known of 'Toinette's disappearance,
                  and, when the whole was told, said,—</p>
               <p>"Well, Susan, you are not to blame. You merely obeyed your mistress's directions,
                  and need not feel that this misfortune is at all your fault. No doubt 'Toinette
                  has gone out by herself, and is, for the moment, lost, but, I trust, will soon be
                  found. You may go at once to the houses of the neighbors whose children she has
                  been in the habit of visiting. Be as quick as you can about it; and, if you do not
                  find her, come directly home, and I will warn the police. Send James up to me as
                  you go down."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Susan, a little comforted; and, as she closed the door, Mr.
                  Legrange returned to his wife, and, clasping her tenderly in his arms, kissed the
                  burning cheeks and glittering eyes that frightened him, until the dangerous calm
                  broke up in a gracious flood of tears and wild sobs of, "My child!—O my little
                  child!"</p>
               <p>"Hush, darling, hush! You must be calm, or I cannot leave you,—cannot go to look
                  for her. I will not leave you so, even to search for her."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, go! I will try—O Paul, Paul! do go and look for her!"</p>
               <p>"When I see you calmer, love; not till then;" and the tender-hearted man could
                  himself have wept to see the heroic efforts of that delicate nature to control
                  itself and<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5676-00000043"/> put his fears to rest. He
                  still was soothing her, when, with a tap at the door, entered James, followed by
                  Susan, who hurriedly announced that 'Toinette was not to be heard of at any of the
                  neighbors, and asked where she should go next.</p>
               <p>"Nowhere! Stay here and attend to Mrs. Legrange until I return. I shall go at once
                  to the police-station. James, you know where Mr. Burroughs lives?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Go to him. Or stay: he is dining with a friend to-day. Here is the direction. Go
                  to this house at once; see Mr. Burroughs; tell him that 'Toinette is lost, and beg
                  him to come up here directly. Keep your eyes open as you go: you may possibly meet
                  her yourself. Hurry, man; hurry for your life!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied the man heartily; and Mr. Legrange returned to his wife, who
                  was walking quickly up and down the room, her hands clasped tight before her, her
                  lips rigid, and her eyes set.</p>
               <p>"There, darling, I have sent for Tom to help us; and no one could do it better
                  than he will. I am going to the police myself. Take courage, dearest, and hope, as
                  I do, that, before morning, we shall have our pet back, safe and sound. But you—O
                  Fanny! how can I leave you so? Try, try, for my sake, for 'Toinette's sake, to be
                  calm and hopeful."</p>
               <p>"Yes—I—will—try!" sobbed the poor mother; and Mr. Legrange, not daring to trust
                  himself to look at her again, lest he also should break down, hastened from the
                  room.</p>
               <p>But morning came, and night, and yet another morning and as the father, the
                  mother, the cousin who was almost brother to both, the assistants, and poor
                  broken-hearted Susan, looked into each other's wan, worn faces, they found nothing
                  there but discouragement, and almost hopeless despair.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange who had not eaten or slept since 'Toinette's disappearance, was
                  already too ill to sit up, but insisted upon remaining dressed, and waiting in the
                  drawing-room for the reports that some one of those engaged in the search brought
                  almost hourly to the house. Her husband, looking like the ghost of his former
                  self, wandered incessantly from his own home to the police-office and back again,
                  each time through some new street, and peering curiously into the face of every
                  child he met, that more than one of them ran frightened home to tell their
                     mothers<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5676-00000044"/> that they had met a crazy man,
                  who stared at them as if he would eat them up.</p>
               <p>And yet no clew, no faintest trace, of the little 'Toinette, who lay tossing in
                  her fever-dreams upon good Mrs. Ginniss's humble bed, while the young doctor day
                  by day shook his head more sadly over her, and said to his own heart that it was
                  only by God's special mercy she could ever rise from that cruel illness.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">A TRACE AND A SEARCH.</head>
               <p>THREE weary nights and two days had passed, when as Mr. Legrange, bending over his
                  wife's sofa, entreated her to take the food and drink he had himself prepared for
                  her, a sharp peal at the bell, followed by a bounding step upon the stair,
                  startled them both.</p>
               <p>"It is Tom, and he has news!" exclaimed Mrs. Legrange in a low voice, as she
                  pushed away the tray and rose to her feet.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and the young man entered, his tired face glowing with hope and
                  satisfaction. In his hand he held a little bundle; and sitting down, with no more
                  than word of greeting, he hastily untied it upon his knee.</p>
               <p>"Aren't these her clothes?" asked he breathlessly, as he held up by one sleeve a
                  little sky-blue merino-dress, with a torn lace undersleeve hanging from the
                  shoulder, and in the other hand a pair of dainty little boots of bronze cloth.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange, with a wild cry, darted forward, and,<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000045"/> grasping the pretty dress, buried her face in it,
                  covering it with kisses, while she cried,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! O Tom! where is she? Tell me quick, before my poor heart breaks with
                  joy!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs remained silent. How could he say that he knew as little as ever how
                  to answer this appeal?</p>
               <p>"Where did you get them, Tom?" asked Mr. Legrange hurriedly.</p>
               <p>"Billings found them in a pawn-broker's shop. You know we gave all the detectives
                  a list of the clothing, and full description of the child. Billings has been all
                  over the city, examining at every pawn-broker's shop all the children's clothes
                  brought in since we lost her, you know"—</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! And when"—</p>
               <p>"Last night he found this in a little out-of-the-way place (I didn't stop to ask
                  where), and, thinking they looked like the right thing, brought them to me. I was
                  asleep, and the people stupidly would not wake me: so he waited; and this morning,
                  when I rose, there he was. I snatched the bundle, and came right along with it.
                  Now, of course, they'll soon find who left them: only, unluckily, they weren't
                  pawned, but sold outright; so they didn't take the name; but the man thinks it was
                  an old woman who sold them to him. He is in custody; and we will go down and hear
                  the examination, Paul."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, at once." And Mr. Legrange nervously buttoned his coat, and moved
                  toward the door.</p>
               <p>"It is to be at ten, and it is now half-past nine. I suppose we had better go at
                  once. Good-by, dear cousin Fanny!" said Mr. Burroughs, looking sorrowfully at the
                  wan face upraised to his, as the poor mother replied,—</p>
               <p>"Good-by, Tom! and oh, pray, do every thing, every thing, that can be done! I
                  cannot tell"—</p>
               <p>She was unable to finish, and the two men hurried away from the sight of a sorrow
                  as yet without remedy.</p>
               <p>The examination of the blear-eyed and stupid old pawn-broker resulted in very
                  little satisfaction. He believed that it was a woman who had sold him the bundle
                  of child's clothing. He was not sure if it were an old or a young woman, but
                  rather thought it was an old woman. It might have been a week ago that he bought
                  them; it might have been more, or it might have been less: he didn't set it down,
                  and couldn't say.</p>
               <p>This was all; and, as nothing could be proved or even suspected of him in
                  connection with 'Toinette's disappearance, he was discharged from custody,
                  although warned to<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5676-00000046"/> hold himself in
                  readiness to appear at any moment when he should be summoned.</p>
               <p>He had not yet, however, left the room, when one of the audience, a policeman off
                  duty, stepped forward, and, intimating that he had something to say, was sworn,
                  and went on to tell how he had been leaning against a lamp-post at the extreme of
                  his beat, just resting a bit, in the edge of evening before last, when he saw an
                  old woman that they call Mother Winch come up the street, carrying a bundle, and
                  leading a little girl. He knew she hadn't any child of her own; and the child was
                  dressed very poor; and Mother Winch called her Judy or Biddy, or some Paddy-name
                  or other; and maybe it was all right, and maybe it wasn't. It could be worked up
                  easy enough, he supposed.</p>
               <p>So supposed the detective in whose hands the clew was immediately placed; but
                  when, an hour later, he descended the steps into Mother Winch's cellar, he found
                  that a keener and a swifter messenger than himself had already called the wretched
                  old woman to account; and she lay across the rusty old stove, quite dead, with a
                  broken bottle of spirit upon the floor beside her, and all the front of her body
                  shockingly burned. The coroner who was called to see her decided that she had
                  fallen across the stove, either in a fit, or too much intoxicated to move, and had
                  died unconscious of her situation. She was buried by public charity, and in her
                  grave seemed hidden every hope of tracing the lost child.</p>
               <p>"She must have been carried from the city," said the detectives; and the search
                  was extended into the country, and to other towns and cities, although not
                  neglected at home.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">TEDDY'S TEMPTATION.</head>
               <p>TEDDY GINNISS sat alone in his master's office, feeling very sad and forlorn: for
                  Dr. Wentworth had that morning said that the chance of life for his little patient
                  was very, very small; and it seemed to Teddy heavier news than human heart had
                  ever borne before. His morning duties over, he had seated himself at his little
                  table, and tried to study the lesson given him by Mr. Burroughs upon the previous
                  day; but a heavy heart makes dim eyes, and the page where Teddy's were fixed
                  seemed to him no better than a crowd of disjointed letters swimming in a blinding
                  mist.</p>
               <p>A hasty step was heard upon the stair; and, passing the sleeve of his jacket
                  across his eyes, the boy bent closer over the book as his master entered the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"Any one been in this morning, Teddy?" asked Mr. Burroughs, passing into the inner
                  office.</p>
               <p>"No, sir."</p>
               <p>"I am going out of town for a day or two, Teddy,—going to New York; and Mr. Barlow
                  will be here to attend to the business. You will do whatever he wishes as you
                  would for me. You understand?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>The good-natured young man, struck by the mournful tone of Teddy's usually hearty
                  voice, turned and looked sharply at him.</p>
               <p>"Aren't you well, Teddy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, thank your honor."</p>
               <p>"Not 'your honor' until I'm a judge, Teddy. But what's amiss with you, my
                  boy?"</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't be troubling your—you with it, sir. It's nothing as can be
                  helped."</p>
               <p>"No, no; but what is it, Teddy?" insisted the lawyer, who saw that Teddy could
                  hardly restrain his tears.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, sir; but the little sister is mortal sick, and the doctor says he's
                  afeard she won't stand it."</p>
               <p>"Your little sister, Teddy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"I didn't know you had one. You never spoke of her before, did you?"</p>
               <p>"Maybe not, sir."</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with her?"</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5676-00000048"/>
               <p>"The faver, sir."</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs knew that this phrase in an Irish mouth means but one disease, and
                  replied, in a sympathizing voice,—</p>
               <p>"Typhus! I'm sorry for you, Teddy, and sorry, too, for your mother, who is an
                  excellent woman; but the little girl may yet recover: while there is life, there
                  is hope, you know. Even if she dies, it is not so bad as—I am going to New York,
                  Teddy, to look for a little cousin of mine whose parents do not know if she is
                  living or dead, suffering or safe: that is worse than to have her ill, but under
                  their care and protection, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, perhaps. Is the little girl in New York, sir, do you think?"</p>
               <p>"We hear of a child found astray there, who answers to the description; and I am
                  going to see her before we mention the report to her mother. Have you never seen
                  Mr. Legrange here, Teddy? It is his little girl. I wonder you haven't heard us
                  talking of the matter."</p>
               <p>"I don't mind the name, sir; and I haven't heard of the little girl before. Is she
                  long lost?"</p>
               <p>"Ten days yesterday. I have been busy all the week in the search for her. The
                  clothes she had on when lost were found in a pawn-broker's shop; but we have no
                  trace of her yet."</p>
               <p>"What looking child was she, if you please, sir?" asked Teddy after a short pause,
                  in which he seemed to study intently; while Mr. Burroughs went on glancing at the
                  newspapers in his hand.</p>
               <p>"'Toinette? Here is a description of her in 'The Journal,' and I have a photograph
                  in my pocket-book. Here it is. It is well for you to study them both; for possibly
                  you may discover her. I didn't think of it before; but you are just the boy to put
                  upon the search. If you should find her, Teddy, Mr. Legrange will make your
                  fortune. He is rich and generous, and this is his only child. Eleven o'clock.
                  Shall be in at one."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Mr. Burroughs threw the paper and photograph upon Teddy's table, and
                  hastily left the office. The boy took up "The Journal," and read the following
                  advertisement:— <q>
                     <p>"Lost, upon the evening of Oct. 31, a little girl, six years of age, named
                        Antoinette Legrange; of slight figure, round face, delicate color, large
                        blue eyes, long curled hair of a bright-yellow color, small mouth, and
                        regular teeth. She was dressed, at the time of her disappearance, in a blue
                        frock and brown boots, with a lady's breakfast-shawl; and<pb n="96-97"
                           xml:id="VAC5676-00000049"/> wore upon the sleeve of her dress a bracelet
                        of coral cameos engraved under the clasp with her name in full. A liberal
                        reward will be paid for information concerning her. Apply at the
                        police-station."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When he had studied this, Teddy took up the photograph, and examined it earnestly.
                  The dress, the long curled hair, the joyous expression, were very different from
                  the pale face, wild eyes, and cropped head of the little sister at home; but
                  Teddy's heart sank within him as he traced the delicate features, the curved lips,
                  and trim little figure. He dropped the picture, and, leaning his face upon his
                  arm, sobbed aloud.</p>
               <p>"I'll lose her anyway, if she dies or if she lives; and it's all the little sister
                  ever I got."</p>
               <p>But presently another thought made Teddy lift his head, and look anxiously about
                  him to make sure that his emotion had not been seen by any one. He was still
                  alone; and, with a sigh of relief, he dashed away the tears from his eyes,
                  muttering,—</p>
               <p>"It's the big fool I am, entirely! Sure and mightn't she have picked up the
                  bracelet in the street, where maybe the little lady they've lost dropped it? And,
                  if she looks like the picture, so does many a one beside; and it's no call I have
                  to be troubling the master with telling him about her anyway. She's my own little
                  sister, and I'll keep her to myself."</p>
               <p>A sudden sharp recollection darted through the boy's mind, and he grew a little
                  pale as he added,—</p>
               <p>"Leastways, I'll keep her if God will let me; and sure isn't he stronger nor me?
                  If it isn't for me to have her, can't he take her, if it's by death, or if it's by
                  leading them that's searching for her to where she is? And more by token, that's
                  the way I'll try it. If God means she shall stay and be my little sister, she'll
                  live, and I'll take her, and say nothing to nobody about it: but, if it's
                  displasin' to him, she'll die; and then I'll tell the master all about it, and he
                  may do what he's a mind to with me. That's the way I'll fix it."</p>
               <p>And Teddy, well satisfied with his own bad argument, took comfort, and went back
                  to his books.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Burroughs returned to the office, he was accompanied by Mr. Barlow, the
                  gentleman who was to occupy it during his absence; and he did not speak to Teddy,
                  except to give him a few directions, and bid him a kind good-by. The paper and
                  picture he found lying upon his desk, and hastily put in his pocket without remark
                  or question.</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5676-00000050"/>
               <p>For the first time in his life, Teddy avoided meeting his master's eye, but
                  watched him furtively over the top of his book, raising it so as to screen his
                  face whenever Mr. Burroughs looked his way, and trembling whenever he spoke to
                  him; and, for the first time in his life, he secretly rejoiced at seeing him leave
                  the office, knowing that he was to be gone for some time.</p>
               <p>The long day was over at last; and, so soon as the hour for closing the office had
                  begun to strike, Teddy locked the door, sprang down stairs, and ran like a deer
                  towards home, feeling as if in some manner the little sister was about to be taken
                  away from him, and he must hasten to prevent it.</p>
               <p>At the foot of the stairs, however, he checked himself, creeping up as silently
                  and cautiously as possible, and stopping at the head to listen for the clear
                  voice, frightfully clear and shrill, of the delirious child, which usually met him
                  there. No sound was to be heard except the deep voice of the Italian organ-grinder
                  in the room below, talking to himself or his monkey as he prepared supper; and
                  Teddy, creeping along the entry to his mother's door, softly opened it, and went
                  in.</p>
               <p>At one side of the bed stood Mrs. Ginniss; at the other, Dr. Wentworth: but Teddy
                  saw only the little waxen face upon the pillow between them,—the little face so
                  strange and lovely now; for all the fever flush had passed away, the babbling lips
                  were folded white and still, the glittering eyes were closed, and the long dark
                  lashes lay motionless upon the cheek,—the little face so strange and terrible in
                  its sudden, peaceful beauty.</p>
               <p>As Teddy softly entered, Dr. Wentworth turned and held a warning finger up; then
                  bent again above the little child, his hand upon her heart.</p>
               <p>The boy crept close to his mother, down whose honest face the tears ran like rain;
                  although she heeded the earnest warning of the physician, and was almost as still
                  as she little form she watched.</p>
               <p>"Is she dead, mother?" whispered Teddy.</p>
               <p>"Whisht, darlint! wait till we know," whispered she in return; and the young
                  doctor glanced impatiently at both out of his strained and eager eyes. Had it been
                  his own and only child, he could not have hung more earnestly about her: and here
                  was the strange, sweet charm of this little life,—that all who came within its
                  influence felt themselves drawn toward it, and opened wide their hearts to allow
                  its entrance; feeling not alone that they loved the lovely<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000051"/> child, but that she was or should be their very
                  own, to cherish and fondle and bind to them forever.</p>
               <p>So the coarse, hard-working woman, who two weeks before had never seen her face,
                  now wept as true and bitter tears as she had done beside the death-bed of the
                  child she had lost when Teddy was a baby; and the young doctor, who had watched
                  the passage of a hundred souls from time to eternity, hung over this little dying
                  form as if all life for him were held within it, and to lose it were to lose all.
                  And Teddy—ah! poor Teddy; for upon his young heart lay not only the bitterness of
                  the death busy with his "little sister's" life, but the heavy burden of wrong and
                  deception, and the proof, as he thought, of God's displeasure in taking from him
                  at last what he had tried so hard to keep.</p>
               <p>He sank upon his knees beside the bed, and hid his face, whispering,—</p>
               <p>"O God! let her live, and I will give her back to them as I kept her from."</p>
               <p>Over and over and over again, he whispered just these words, clinching tight his
                  boy-hands to keep down the agony of the sacrifice; while in the very centre of his
                  heart throbbed a hard, dull pain, that seemed as if it would rend it asunder.</p>
               <p>His face was still hidden, when, like an answer to his petition, came the softest
                  of whispers from the doctor's lips,—</p>
               <p>"She will live, with God's help, and the best of care from you."</p>
               <p>"An' it's the bist uv care she'll git, I'll pass me word for that," whispered back
                  Teddy's mother, so earnestly, that the doctor answered,—</p>
               <p>"Hush! She is falling asleep. Do not wake her, for her life!"</p>
               <p>He sank into a chair as he spoke. Mrs. Ginniss crept round to the stove, and,
                  crouching beside it, covered her head with her apron, and remained motionless. As
                  for Teddy, he never stirred or looked up, but with his face hidden upon the bed,
                  repeated again and again those words, to him so solemn and so full of meaning,
                  until in the silence and the waiting he fell asleep, and gradually sank upon the
                  floor.</p>
               <p>And so the night went on: and the careful eyes of the young physician marked how a
                  faint tinge of color crept into the death-white cheek upon the pillow; and how the
                  still lips lost their hard, cold line, and grew human once more, though so pale;
                  and how the eyelids stirred, moving<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5676-00000052"/> the
                  heavy lashes; and a faint pulse fluttered in the slender throat.</p>
               <p>At last, with a long, soft sigh, the lips lightly parted; the eyelids opened
                  slowly, showing for a moment the blue eyes, dim and languid, but no longer wild
                  with delirium; and then they slowly closed, and the breath came softly and
                  regularly from the parted lips.</p>
               <p>Dr. Wentworth heaved an answering sigh of mingled weariness and relief, and,
                  rising, went to Mrs. Ginniss's side, touching her upon the shoulder, and
                  whispering,—</p>
               <p>"She is doing well. Keep her as quiet as possible. I will be in at nine."</p>
               <p>Hushing the murmured blessings she would have poured upon his head, the young man
                  stole softly from the room and down the stairs into the street, where already the
                  first gray of dawn struggled with the flaring gas-lights.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE CACHUCA.</head>
               <p>TEN days more, and beside the fire in Mrs. Ginniss's attic-room sat a little
                  figure, propped in the wooden rocking-chair with pillows and comfortables; while
                  upon a small stand close beside her were arranged a few cheap toys, a plate with
                  some pieces of orange upon it, a sprig of geranium in a broken-nosed pitcher of
                  water, and a cup of beef-tea.</p>
               <p>But for none of these did the languid little invalid seem to care; and lying back
                  in the chair, her head nestled into the pillow, her parched lips open, and her
                  eyes half closed, she looked so little like the bright and glowing 'Toinette who
                  had danced at her birthday-party not a month before, that it is a question if any
                  one but her own mother would have believed her to be the same.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss, hard at work upon the frills of a fashionable lady's skirt, paused
                  every few moments to look over her shoulder at the little wasted face with the
                  wistful look of<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5676-00000053"/> some dumb creature who
                  sees its offspring suffering, and cannot tell how to relieve it.</p>
               <p>Suddenly setting the flat-iron she had just taken back upon the stove, the
                  washwoman came and bent over the child, looking earnestly into her face.</p>
               <p>"An' it's waker an' whiter she gits every day. Sure and I'm afther seeing the
                  daylight through the little hands uv her; and her eyes is that big, they take the
                  breath uv me whin I mate 'em. See, darlint!—see the purty skip-jack Teddy brought
                  ye!"</p>
               <p>She took from the table the toy she named, and, pulling the string, made the
                  figure of the man vault over the top of the stick and back several times, crying
                  at the same time,—</p>
               <p>"Hi, thin!—hi, thin! See how the crather joomps, honey!"</p>
               <p>But, although the languid eyes of the child followed her motions for a moment, no
                  shadow of a smile stirred the parched lips; and presently the eyes closed, as if
                  the effort were too much for them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss laid the toy upon the table, and took up the cup of beef-tea.</p>
               <p>"Have a soop of yer dhrink, darlint?" said she, tenderly holding the cup to the
                  child's lips, and raising her head with the other hand; but, with a moan of
                  impatience or distress, the weary head turned itself upon the pillow, and the
                  little wasted hand half rose to push away the cup.</p>
               <p>"An' what is it I'll plaze ye wid, mavourneen? Do yees want Teddy to coom home?"
                  asked the poor woman in despair.</p>
               <p>A faint murmur of assent crept from between the parched lips; and the eyes, slowly
                  opening, glanced toward the door.</p>
               <p>"It's this minute he'll be here, thin," said the washwoman joyfully. "An' faith
                  yees ought to love him, honey; for he'd give the two eyes out of his head to plaze
                  yees, an' git down on his knees to thank yees for takin' 'em. Now, thin, don't ye
                  hear his fut upon the stair?"</p>
               <p>But the heavy steps coming up the stairs were not Teddy's, as his mother well
                  knew; and although, when they stopped upon the landing below her own, she
                  pretended to be much surprised, she would, in reality, have been much more so if
                  they had not stopped.</p>
               <p>"And it's Jovarny it wor that time, honey," said she soothingly: "but Teddy'll
                  coom nixt; see if he doun't, Cherry darlint."</p>
               <p>But Cherry, closing her eyes, with no effort at reply, lay<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000054"/> as motionless upon her pillow as if she had been
                  asleep or in a swoon.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, from the room below, was heard a strain of plaintive music. The
                  organ-grinder, for some reason or other, was trying his instrument in his own
                  room; although, remembering the sick child above, he played as softly and slowly
                  as he could. It was the first time he had done so since Cherry had been ill; and
                  Mrs. Ginniss anxiously watched her face to see what effect the sounds would
                  have.</p>
               <p>The air was "Kathleen Mavourneen;" and, as one tender strain succeeded another,
                  the watchful nurse could see a faint color stealing into the child's face, while
                  from between the half-closed lids her eyes shone brighter than they had for many a
                  day.</p>
               <p>"If it plazes her, I'll pay him to grind away all day, the crather," murmured she
                  joyfully.</p>
               <p>The song ended, and, after a little pause, was succeeded by a lively
                  dancing-tune.</p>
               <p>"She'll not like that so well, thought Mrs. Ginniss; but, to her great
                  astonishment, the child, after listening a moment, started upright in her chair,
                  her eyes wide open and shining with excitement, her cheeks glowing, and her little
                  hands fluttering.</p>
               <p>"Mamma, mamma! I'm Cherritoe! and I can dance with that music, and mamma can play
                  it more"—</p>
               <p>The words faltered upon her lips, and she sank suddenly back upon the pillows in a
                  death-faint. At the same moment, Teddy came bounding up the stairs and into the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"Go an' shtop that fool's noise if yees brain him, an' ax him what's the name o'
                  that divil's jig he's playing!" exclaimed Mrs. Ginniss as she caught sight of the
                  boy; and Teddy, without stopping for a question, hastily obeyed.</p>
               <p>In a moment he was back.</p>
               <p>"It's the cachuca, mother; but what's the matter with the little sister?"</p>
               <p>"Whist! She's swounded wid the noise he's afther making," replied his mother
                  angrily, as she laid the wasted little figure upon her bed, and bathed the temples
                  with cold water.</p>
               <p>Teddy stood anxiously looking on. Ever since the night when the little sister's
                  fever had turned, and the doctor had promised that she should live, a struggle had
                  been going on in the boy's heart. He could not but believe that God had given back
                  the almost-departed life in answer to his earnest prayer and promise; and he had
                  no intention of breaking<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5676-00000055"/> the promise,
                  or withholding the price he felt himself to have offered for that life. But, like
                  many older and better taught persons, Teddy did not see clearly enough how little
                  difference there is between doing right and failing to do right, or how much
                  difference between promising with the lips and promising with the heart.</p>
               <p>While his little sister, as he still called her, lay between life and death, Teddy
                  said to himself that the excitement of seeing her friends might be fatal to her,
                  and that, if she should die, their grief in this second loss would be greater than
                  what they were now suffering.</p>
               <p>When she began slowly to recover, he said that they would only be frightened at
                  seeing her so wasted and weak, and that he would keep her until she had recovered
                  something of her good looks; and, finally, he had begun to think that it would be
                  no more than fair that he should repay himself for all the sorrow and anxiety her
                  illness had given him by keeping her a little while after she was quite well and
                  strong, and could go for a walk with him, and see the beautiful shops, with their
                  Christmas-wares displayed.</p>
               <p>"New Year's will be soon enough. I'll take her to the master for a New-Year's
                  gift," Teddy had said to himself that very night as he came up the stairs; and a
                  sort of satisfaction crept into his heart in thinking that he had at least fixed a
                  date for fulfilling his promise.</p>
               <p>But New-Year's Day found 'Toinette, or Cherry as we must learn to call her, more
                  unlike her former self than she had been when he formed the resolution. The
                  strange emotion that had overcome her in listening to the organ-grinder's music
                  had caused a relapse into fever, followed by other troubles; and spite of Dr.
                  Wentworth's constant care, Mrs. Ginniss's patient and tender nursing, and Teddy's
                  devotion, the child seemed pining away without hope or remedy.</p>
               <p>"I'll wait till the spring comes, anyway," said Teddy to himself. "Maybe the warm
                  weather will bring her round, and I'll hear her laugh out once, and take her for
                  just one walk on the Commons before I carry her to the master."</p>

               <head type="sub">GIOVANNI AND PANTALON.</head>
               <p>IT was April; and the bit of sky to be seen between two tall roofs, from the
                  window of Mrs. Ginniss's attic, had suddenly grown of a deeper blue, and was
                  sometimes crossed by a great white, glittering cloud, such as is never seen in
                  winter; and, when the window was raised for a few moments, the air came in soft
                  and mild, and with a fresh smell to it, as if it had blown through budding trees
                  and over fresh-ploughed earth.</p>
               <p>Cherry was now well enough to be dressed, and to play about the room, or sew a
                  little, or look at pictures in the gaudily painted books Teddy anxiously saved his
                  coppers to buy for her: but, more than once in the day, she would push a chair to
                  the bed, and climb up to lie upon it; or would come and cling to her
                  foster-mother, moaning,—</p>
               <p>"I'm tired now, mammy. Hold me in your lap."</p>
               <p>And very seldom was the petition refused, although the wash-tub or the
                  ironing-table stood idle that it might be granted; for so well had great-hearted
                  Mrs. Ginniss come to love the child, that she would have been as unwilling as
                  Teddy himself to remember that she had not always been her own.</p>
               <p>Sitting thus in her mammy's lap one day, Cherry suddenly asked,—</p>
               <p>"Where's the music, mammy?"</p>
               <p>"The music, darlint? And what music do ye be manin'?"</p>
               <p>"The music I heard one day before I went to heaven. Didn't you hear it?"</p>
               <p>"An' whin did ye go to hivin, ye quare child?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I don't know. When I came back, I was sick in the bed. I want the music,
                  mammy."</p>
               <p>"It's Jovarny she manes, the little crather," said Mrs. Ginniss, and promised,
                  that if Cherry would lie on the bed, and let her "finish ironing the lady's
                  clothes all so pretty," she should hear the music as soon as Teddy and the
                  organ-grinder came home.</p>
               <p>To this proposal, Cherry consented more willingly than her mammy had dared to
                  expect; and when, after finishing the ironing of some intricate embroideries, the
                  laundress turned to look, she found the child had dropped quietly asleep.</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5676-00000057"/>
               <p>"An' all the betther fur yees, darlint," said she. "Whin ye waken, ye'll think no
                  more uv the music that well-nigh kilt yees afore."</p>
               <p>An hour later, Teddy's entrance aroused the sleeper, who, rolling over upon the
                  bed with a pretty little gape, smiled upon him, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Where's the music, Teddy? Mammy said you'd get it for me."</p>
               <p>"It's Jovarny she's afther wantin' to hear play on his grind-orgin; an' I towld
                  her he'd coom whin yees did," explained Mrs. Ginniss: and Teddy, delighted to be
                  asked to do any thing for his little sister, lost no time in running down stairs,
                  and begging the Italian, who had just returned home, to play one of the prettiest
                  tunes in his list, but on no account to touch the one that had so strangely
                  affected the little invalid upon a former occasion.</p>
               <p>The Italian very willingly complied, and was already in the midst of a pretty
                  waltz when Teddy re-appeared in his mother's room. Cherry's delight was unbounded;
                  and when the whole list of tunes, with the exception of the cachuca, had been
                  exhausted, she put her arms round Teddy's neck, and kissed him, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Thank you, little brother. I'll eat my supper for you now."</p>
               <p>And this, as Cherry had hardly been willing to eat any thing since her illness,
                  was considered, both by Teddy and herself, as a remarkable proof of amiability and
                  affection.</p>
               <p>The next day, before Teddy went away in the morning, he was obliged to promise
                  that he would bring the music at night; and, as he ran down stairs, he stopped to
                  beg the organ-grinder to come home as early as possible, and to come prepared to
                  play for the little sister's benefit.</p>
               <p>"Let her come down and see the organ and Pantalon," said the Italian in his broken
                  English; and Teddy eagerly cried,—</p>
               <p>"Oh! may she?" and ran up stairs again with the invitation. But Mrs. Ginniss
                  prudently declared that Cherry must not think of leaving her own room at present,
                  while the stairs and entries were so cold; and "Thin agin," said she, "maybe the
                  bit moonkey ud scare her back into the fayver as bad as iver."</p>
               <p>So, for a week or two longer, Cherry was obliged to content herself with an
                  evening-concert through the floor; and upon these concerts the whole of the day
                  seemed to depend. Very soon the little girl began to have her favorites among the
                  half-dozen airs she so often heard, and, little by little, learned to hum them
                  all, giving them names of her<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5676-00000058"/> own.
                  "Kathleen Mavourneen" she always called "Susan," although quite unable to give any
                  reason for so doing; and Teddy, who watched her constantly, noticed that she
                  always remained very thoughtful, wearing a puzzled, anxious look, while hearing
                  it. After a time, however, this dim association with the almost-forgotten past
                  wore away; and although Cherry still called the air "Susan," and liked it better
                  than any of the rest, it seemed to have become a thing of the present instead of
                  the past.</p>
               <p>At last, one warm day in April, when Giovanni had returned home earlier than
                  usual, and Teddy again brought an invitation to the <foreign xml:lang="ITA"
                     >bambína</foreign>, as he called Cherry, to visit him, Mrs. Ginniss reluctantly
                  consented; and the little girl, wrapped in shawls and hood, with warm stockings
                  pulled over her shoes, was carried in Teddy's arms down the stairs as she had been
                  brought up in them six months before. The boy himself was the first to think of
                  it, and, as he stooped to take the little figure in his arms, said,—</p>
               <p>"You haven't been over the stairs, sissy, since Teddy brought you up last
                  fall."</p>
               <p>"Teddy didn't bring me up. I never came up, 'cause I never was down," said Cherry
                  resolutely; and the boy, who dreaded above all things to awaken in her mind any
                  recollection of the past, said no more, but carefully wrapping the shawl about
                  her, and promising his mother not to stay too long, carried her gently down the
                  stairs, and to the door Giovanni opened as he heard them approach.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, little one!" said the Italian in his own language as they entered; and
                  Cherry smiled at the sound, and then looked troubled and thoughtful.</p>
               <p>The truth was, that 'Toinette's father and mother had often spoken both Italian
                  and French in her presence; and although the terrible fever had destroyed her
                  memory of home and parents, and all that went before, the things that she had
                  known in those forgotten days still awoke in her heart a vague sense of pain and
                  loss,—an effort to recall something that seemed just vanishing away, as through
                  the strings of a broken and forsaken harp will sweep some vagrant breeze, wakening
                  the ghosts of its forgotten melodies to a brief and shadowy life, again to pass
                  and be forgotten.</p>
               <p>So 'Toinette, still clinging to Teddy's neck, turned, and fixed her great eyes
                  upon the Italian's dark face so earnestly and so piteously, that he smiled,
                  showing all his white teeth, and asked,—</p>
               <p>"Does the little one know the language of my country?" </p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5676-00000059"/>
               <p>"No: of course she don't. I don't," said Teddy, looking a little anxiously into
                  Cherry's face, and wondering in his own heart if she might not have known Italian
                  in that former life, of whose loves and interests he had always been so
                  jealous.</p>
               <p>Giovanni looked curiously at the two children. Cherry, in recovering from her
                  illness, was regaining the wonderful beauty, that, for a time, had seemed lost.
                  The remnant of her golden hair spared by Mother Winch's shears had fallen off
                  after the first attack of fever, and was now replaced by thick, short curls of a
                  sunny brown, clustering about her white forehead with a careless grace far more
                  bewitching than the elaborate ringlets Susan had been so proud of manufacturing;
                  while long confinement to the house had rendered the delicate complexion so pearly
                  in its whiteness, so exquisite in its rose-tints, that one could hardly believe it
                  possible that flesh and blood should become so etherealized even while gaining
                  health and strength.</p>
               <p>The subtle eye of the Italian marked every point of this exquisite loveliness, ran
                  admiringly over the outlines of the graceful figure, the delicate hands and little
                  feet, the classic curve of the lips, the thin nostrils and tiny ears; then
                  returned turned to the clear, full eyes, with their pencilled brows and heavy
                  lashes, and smiled at the earnestness of the gaze that met his own. Then, from
                  this lovely and patrician face, the Italian's eyes wandered to Teddy's coarse and
                  unformed features, and figure of uncouth strength.</p>
               <p>"Nightingales are not hatched from hens' eggs," muttered Giovanni in his native
                  tongue.</p>
               <p>"Speak that some more; I like it," said Cherry softly.</p>
               <p>"Yes; and you are like it, and, like all that belongs to my Italian, beautiful and
                  graceful," said Giovanni, dropping the liquid accents as lovingly from his lips as
                  if they had been a kiss. Then, in the imperfect English he generally spoke, he
                  asked of Teddy,—</p>
               <p>"Where did the child come from?"</p>
               <p>"She's my little sister," replied the boy doggedly.</p>
               <p>The Italian shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows, muttering in his own
                  tongue,—</p>
               <p>"I never heard or saw any child above there in the first weeks of my living here.
                  But what affair is it of mine? The child I have lost is safe with the Holy
                  Mother!"</p>
               <p>He crossed himself, and muttered a prayer; then from behind the stove, where he
                  lay warming himself, pulled a little creature, at sight of whom Cherry uttered a
                  scream, and clung to Teddy.</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5676-00000060"/>
               <p>"It's the monkey, sissy; it's Jovarny's monkey; and his name is Pantaloons,"
                  explained Teddy.</p>
               <p>"Pantalon," corrected the monkey's master; and snapping his fingers, and whistling
                  to the monkey, he called him to his shoulder, and made him go through a number of
                  tricks and gestures,—some of them so droll, that Cherry's terror ended in peals of
                  laughter; and she soon left Teddy's side to run and caper about the room in
                  imitation of the monkey's antics.</p>
               <p>"Does she dance, the little one?" asked Giovanni, watching the child's lithe
                  movements admiringly.</p>
               <p>"Sure, and every step she takes is as good as dancing," said Teddy evasively.</p>
               <p>"Let us see, then."</p>
               <p>And the Italian, arranging the stops of his organ, played the pretty waltz Cherry
                  had so often heard from it, and liked so well.</p>
               <p>The child continued her frolicsome motions, unconsciously adapting them to the
                  music, until she was moving in perfect harmony with it, although not in the step
                  or figure of a waltz.</p>
               <p>"She was born to dance!" exclaimed Giovanni with enthusiasm; and, moving the stops
                  of the organ, he passed, without pause, into the gay and airy movement of the
                  cachuca.</p>
               <p>As the first tones struck the child's ear, she faltered; then stopped, turned
                  pale, and listened intently.</p>
               <p>"Whisht! That's the tune I told you not to play!" exclaimed Teddy. But Giovanni,
                  his eyes fixed upon the child, did not hear or did not heed him, but played on;
                  while Cherry, trembling, pale, her hands clasped, lips apart, and eyes fixed
                  intently upon the musician, seemed shaken to the very soul by some strange and
                  undefined emotion. Suddenly a scarlet flush mounted to the roots of her hair, her
                  eyes grew bright, her parted lips curved to a roguish smile; and, pointing her
                  little foot, she spun away in the graceful movements of the dance, and continued
                  it to the close, finishing with a courtesy, and kiss of the hand, that made
                  Giovanni drop the handle of his organ, clasp his hands, and cry in Italian,—</p>
               <p>"Bravo, bravo, picciola! Truly you were born to dance!"</p>
               <p>But the child, suddenly losing the life and color that had sparkled through every
                  line of face and figure, ran with a wild cry to Teddy, and, clasping him tight
                  round the neck, burst into a flood of tears, crying,—</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5676-00000061"/>
               <p>"Take me home, Teddy!—quick, quick! I want mamma!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss had taught her to say "mammy;" and Teddy remembered with dismay that
                  she had never used the name "mamma," except in the delirium of her fever, when she
                  was evidently addressing some distant and beloved object. But still he chose to
                  understand the appeal in his own way; and, hastily wrapping the shawls about the
                  little figure, he raised it in his arms, saying soothingly,—</p>
               <p>"Come, then; come to mammy, little sister. You didn't ought to have danced and get
                  all tired."</p>
               <p>"Good-by, little one," said Giovanni somewhat ruefully. The child raised her head
                  from Teddy's shoulder, and, smiling through her tears, said sweetly,—</p>
               <p>"Good-by, 'Varny. It wasn't you made me cry, but because"—</p>
               <p>"'Cause you was tired, little sister," interposed Teddy hastily; and Giovanni
                  looked at him craftily.</p>
               <p>"I'll come and see you another day, 'Varny; but I must go lie down now," continued
                  Cherry, anxious to remove any wound her new friend's feelings might have received.
                  And the organ-grinder smiled until he showed all his white teeth, as he replied,—
                  "Yes, and again and again,—as often as you will, picciola."</p>
               <p>But Teddy, shaking his head disapprovingly, muttered, as he carried his little
                  sister away,—</p>
               <p>"No: it isn't good for you, sissy, to get so tired and worried."</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE PINK-SILK DRESS.</head>
               <p>BUT, spite of Teddy's disapproval and his mother's doubts, neither of them could
                  resist the earnestness of Cherry's entreaties, day after day, to be allowed to "go
                  down and see the music in 'Varny's room;" and it finally became quite a regular
                  thing for Teddy, upon his return home, to find his little sister ready shawled and
                  hooded, and waiting for him to accompany her.</p>
               <p>As the summer came on, and whole streets-full of his patrons left the city,
                  Giovanni became less regular in his hours of leavings or returning home; often
                  remaining in his room several hours of the day, smoking, sleeping, or training
                  Pantalon in new accomplishments.</p>
               <p>So sure as she knew him to be at home, Cherry gave her foster-mother no peace
                  until she had consented to allow her to visit him; and Mrs. Ginniss said to
                  herself, "Sure, and it's no harm the little crather can git uv man nor monkey nor
                  music; an' what's the good uv crossin' her?"</p>
               <p>So it finally came about that Cherry spent many more hours in the company of
                  Giovanni, Pantalon, and the organ, than Teddy either knew, or would have liked,
                  had his mother thought fit to tell him.</p>
               <p>At first, the conversation between the new friends was carried on in the imperfect
                  English used by both; but, very soon, Giovanni, noticing the facility with which
                  the child adopted an occasional word of Italian, set himself to teach her the
                  language, and succeeded beyond his expectations. Indeed it seemed to him that the
                  soft and liquid accents of the beloved tongue had never sounded to him so sweet
                  beneath Italian skies as now, when they fell from the rosy lips and pure tones of
                  the charming child whom he, with all who approached her, was learning to love with
                  the best love of his nature.</p>
               <p>Besides the Italian lessons, Giovanni taught his little pupil to sing several of
                  the popular songs of his native city of Naples, and to perform several of his
                  national dances; watching with an ever-new delight the grace and ease of her
                  movements, and the quickness with which she caught at his every hint and
                  gesture.</p>
               <p>Occasionally, Cherry insisted upon making Pantalon join in the dance; and the
                  somewhat sombre face of the Italian<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5676-00000063"/>
                  would ripple all over with laughter as he watched her efforts to subdue the
                  creature's motions to grace and harmony, and to cultivate in his bestial brain her
                  own innate love of those divine gifts.</p>
               <p>"You will never make him dance as if of heaven, as you do, picciola," said he one
                  day; and Cherry suddenly stood still, and, dropping the monkey's paws, came to her
                  teacher's side, asking eagerly,—</p>
               <p>"Have you been to heaven too? and did you see me dance there?"</p>
               <p>"Padre Johannes says we all came from heaven; so I suppose I did, and perhaps
                  Pantalon also," said the Italian with a comical grimace: "but, if so, I have long
                  forgotten what I saw there. Do you remember heaven, picciola?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I don't now," slowly replied the child with the weary and puzzled look she
                  so often wore. "Sometimes I do. I used to dance; and mamma—that wasn't mammy—was
                  there: but there was a naughty lady that slapped me; and there was a little
                  man—why, it was Pantalon, wasn't it? Did Pantalon eat some cake that I—no, that
                  some one gave him? Oh! I don't know; and I am so tired! I guess I'll go see mammy
                  now, and lie down on the bed."</p>
               <p>Giovanni did not try to detain the child, but, after closing the door behind her,
                  remained looking at it as if he still saw the object of his thoughts, while an
                  expression of perplexity and doubt clouded the careless good-humor of his face.
                  Presently, however, it cleared; and, with a significant gesture of the head, he
                  muttered,—</p>
               <p>"What then? Is it my business or my fault? Come, Pantalon: we shall sup."</p>
               <p>When Cherry appeared the next day in Giovanni's room, it was with as gay and
                  untroubled a face as if no haunting memories had ever vexed her; and Giovanni, who
                  liked her sunny mood much the best, was careful not to awaken any other. He played
                  for her to dance; he sang with her; he told her stories of Italy, and the merry
                  life he had lived there with his wife and child.</p>
               <p>"And my little Julietta, like you, loved music and dancing, and sang like the
                  angels," said he, smoothing Cherry's shining curls.</p>
               <p>"Did she? Then she sings in heaven, and is happy: and by and by, when we go there,
                  we'll see her; won't we?"</p>
               <p>The Italian shook his head.</p>
               <p>"You may, picciola; but the good God, if he takes<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000064"/> me to heaven, must make me so changed, that
                  Julietta could no longer know me, or I her. We men are not as little maidens."</p>
               <p>Then, with a sudden change of mood, the Italian snatched from its case his
                  cherished violin, and drew from it such joyous strains, that the child, clapping
                  her hands, and skipping round the room, cried,—</p>
               <p>"It laughs! the music laughs, and makes me laugh too! And Pantalon—see poor
                  Pantalon try to laugh, and he can't!"</p>
               <p>Giovanni stopped suddenly, and laid down his violin. A new thought, a sudden plan,
                  had entered his head, and made his breath come quick, and his eyes grow bright. He
                  looked attentively at the child for a moment, and then said,—</p>
               <p>"Julietta used to wear such a beautiful dress, and go with me to the houses of
                  rich people to dance; but you dance better than she did, picciola."</p>
               <p>"Oh! let me go, and wear a beautiful dress. I don't like this dress a bit!" said
                  Cherry, plucking nervously at the coarse and tawdry calico frock Mrs. Ginniss had
                  thought it quite a triumph to obtain and to make up.</p>
               <p>"I have saved two of Julietta's dresses for love of her. You shall see them," said
                  the Italian; and from the box where he kept his clothes he presently brought a
                  small bundle, and, unfolding it, shook out two little frocks,—one of pink silk,
                  covered with spangles; the other a gay brocade, upon whose white ground tiny
                  rosebuds were dotted in a graceful pattern. Some long silk stockings, and white
                  satin boots with red heels, and blue tassels at the ankle, dropped from the
                  bundle; and from one of the latter Giovanni drew a wreath of crushed and faded
                  artificial roses.</p>
               <p>"All these were given her by the beautiful marchésa for whom she was named. Many
                  times we have been to play and dance before her palázzo; and she, sending for us
                  in, has given the little one a dress or a wreath, or a handful of confetti, or a
                  silver-piece in her hand. It was when the marchésa died that our troubles began;
                  and in three months more the little Julietta followed her, and Stephána (that was
                  my wife) went from me, and— But see, picciola! is it not a pretty dress? Let us
                  put it upon you, and it shall dance the Romaika with you as it once did with
                  her."</p>
               <p>Nothing loath, Cherry hastened, with the help of the Italian, to array herself in
                  the pink-silk frock, and to<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5676-00000065"/> exchange
                  her coarse shoes for the silken hose and satin boots of the little lost Julietta.
                  Although somewhat large, the clothes fitted better than those Cherry had taken
                  off; and when, seizing the violin, Giovanni drew a long, warning note, the little
                  dancer took her position, and pointed her tiny foot with so assured and graceful
                  an air, that the Italian, nodding and smiling, cried with enthusiasm,—</p>
               <p>"Ah, ah! See the little Taglioni! Why is she not upon the boards of La Scála?"</p>
               <p>What this might mean Cherry could not guess, nor greatly cared to know. She
                  understood that her friend was pleased, and her little heart beat high with vanity
                  and excitement. She danced as she had never danced before; and at the end, while
                  Giovanni still applauded, and before she had regained her breath, the child was
                  panting,—</p>
               <p>"I want to go and dance for the rich ladies, like Julietta used to do, and wear
                  her beautiful dresses, and have a wreath."</p>
               <p>"Why not, then?" exclaimed the Italian eagerly. "Only you must never say so to the
                  woman above there or the boy: they will not allow it."</p>
               <p>"Won't mammy and Teddy like it? Then I can't go. Oh, dear! Why won't they like it,
                  'Varny?"</p>
               <p>"Because they can't dance, and they don't want you to be different from them; and
                  they will be afraid you will tire yourself. They don't know that it makes you well
                  and happy to dance, and hear music, as it does me to make it. They are not like
                  us, these people above there."</p>
               <p>Cherry looked earnestly in his face, and her own suddenly flushed while she
                  replied indignantly,—</p>
               <p>"They're real good, 'Varny; and I love them same as I do you and Pantalon. Don't
                  you love them?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! but I adore them, picciola; and I like well that you should place me and
                  Pantalon beside them. But surely they do not dance, or love music, as we do."</p>
               <p>Cherry shut tight her lips, and shook her head with an uneasy expression.</p>
               <p>"Mammy says she don't believe they dance in heaven: and Teddy says it wasn't there
                  I used to learn; for I never went anywhere but to mammy's room since I was
                  borned."</p>
               <p>"But they do dance in heaven, and sing, and listen to music; and it is because you
                  came from heaven so little while ago that you remember, and they have
                     forgotten,"<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5676-00000066"/> said Giovanni
                  positively. "And it is right that you should love these things; and it is right
                  that you should go with me, and say nothing to them till we come back. I will ask
                  the good woman that I may take you for a walk in a day or two and I will carry the
                  pretty dress and the violin; and, when we are away from the house, you shall put
                  it on, and we will go and dance for the rich people a little while; and some one
                  shall give you beautiful things, and much money, as they did Julietta; and then we
                  will come home, and bring it all to the mammy, and she will be so happy, and see
                  that it is a good thing, after all, to dance."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; that will be splendid!" cried Cherry, clapping her hands and jumping up
                  and down. "I will save every bit of the candy, and all the beautiful dresses, and
                  the roses, and every thing, and bring them to mammy."</p>
               <p>"And the money, that she may buy bread and clothes and wood, and not have to work
                  so hard for them herself," suggested Giovanni artfully.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Teddy gives her money; and she calls him her brave, good boy. So she'll call
                  me too, pretty soon; won't she?"</p>
               <p>"Truly will she; but remember always, picciola, that she nor Teddy must know any
                  thing of this, or they will prevent it all. You won't tell them?"</p>
               <p>"No; I won't tell," said Cherry, shuttling her lips very tight, and shaking her
                  head a great many times. "Only we must go very quick, or else I might forget; and,
                  when I opened my mouth, it might jump out before I knew."</p>
               <p>"We will go to-morrow if it is fine," said Giovanni, after a moment of
                  consideration; and Cherry, after changing her clothes, returned home so full of
                  mystery and importance, that unless Mrs. Ginniss had been more than usually busy,
                  and Teddy obliged to hurry with his supper and go directly out again, one or the
                  other must have suspected that something very mysterious was working in the mind
                  of their little pet.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">BEGINNING A NEW LIFE.</head>
               <p>As if to favor Giovanni's plot, it chanced, that, in the morning of the next day,
                  Mrs. Ginniss received a sudden summons to the bedside of Ann Dolan, the friend
                  whose advice had led to Teddy's being placed in his present situation.</p>
               <p>The messenger had reported that Ann was "very bad wid her heart, an' the life was
                  knocked out intirely, sure:" and Mrs. Ginniss felt herself bound to hasten to the
                  help of her friend, should she still be alive; or to see that she was "waked
                  dacent" if dead. Just as she was wondering if it was best to take Cherry with her,
                  or to leave her locked up alone until her return, Giovanni appeared at the door,
                  his face disposed in its most winning smile, and his manner as respectful as if he
                  had been addressing the marchésa who had been his own and his daughter's
                  patron.</p>
               <p>"Will my good neighbor allow that the little girl go for a walk with me this fine
                  morning?" asked he. "I would like to show her the flowers and the swans in the
                  gardens of the city."</p>
               <p>"An' will you take the monkey an' the grind-orgin the day?" asked Mrs. Ginniss
                  doubtfully.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, no! I go to a walk to enjoy the fine time, and to see the flowers and the
                  swans," explained Giovanni in his best English, and with a proportion of bows and
                  smiles; while Cherry stood by, her little face full of surprise and mystery, not
                  unmingled with a little shame as she felt that her good mammy was being deceived
                  and misled by the wily Italian.</p>
               <p>"Faith, thin, Mr. Jovarny, it's very perlite ye are iver an' always ; but I don't
                  jist feel aisy wid the child out uv my sight. Mabbe she'd better wait till night,
                  when Teddy can take her out."</p>
               <p>"Oh, let me go, mammy! I want to go with 'Varny, and I'll bring you"—</p>
               <p>"Yes; we'll get the pretty flowers to bring to mammy, she would say," interrupted
                  the Italian hastily; and Mrs. Ginniss, looking down at the little anxious face and
                  pleading eyes, found her better judgment suddenly converted into a desire to
                  please her little darling at any rate, and to see her smile again in her own sunny
                  fashion.</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5676-00000068"/>
               <p>"Sure, an' ye shall go, 'vourneen, if it's that bad ye're wantin' it," said she,
                  stooping to take the child in her arms; and, as Cherry kissed her again and again,
                  she added,—</p>
               <p>"An' it's well ye don't ask the heart out uv me body; for it's inter yer hand I'd
                  have to give it, colleen bawn."</p>
               <p>Giovanni looked on, his half-shut, black eyes glittering, and a wily smile
                  wrinkling his sallow cheek.</p>
               <p>"Every one has his day," muttered he in Italian, "Your's to-day, good woman; mine
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Half an hour later, Cherry, dressed as neatly as her foster-mother's humble means
                  and taste would allow, and her face glowing with pleasure and excitement, skipped
                  out of the door of the tenement-house, looking like the fairy princess in a
                  pantomime as she suddenly emerges from the hovel where she has been hidden.</p>
               <p>Giovanni followed, carrying a bundle, and his violin wrapped in papers. These, he
                  explained to Mrs. Ginniss, were only some matters he had to leave with a friend as
                  he went along; but he should not go into any house, or take the little girl
                  anywhere but for the walk he had mentioned.</p>
               <p>"Faix, an' it's mighty ginteel ye are, anyway, Misther Jovarny," said the
                  Irishwoman, watching the pair from the window of her attic as they walked slowly
                  up the street. "But I'm afther wishin' I'd said no whin I said yis. Nor yet I
                  couldn't tell why, more than that Teddy'll be mad to hear she's been wid him. But
                  the b'y hasn't sinse whin it's about the little sisther he's talkin'. He thinks
                  the ground isn't good enough for her to walk on, nor goold bright enough for her
                  to wear."</p>
               <p>So saying, Mrs. Ginniss closed the window, and, throwing a little shawl over her
                  head, locked the door, leaving the key underneath, and hurried away to her sick
                  friend, with whom she staid till nearly night.</p>
               <p>Giovanni and Cherry, meantime, walked gayly on, chatting, now of the wonderful
                  things about them, now of the yet more wonderful scenes they were to visit. At a
                  confectioner's shop, in a shady by-street, they stopped to rest for a while; and
                  the Italian provided his little guest with ice-creams, cakes, and candies, to her
                  heart's content.</p>
               <p>"I like these better than potatoes and pork-meat. I used to eat these in heaven,"
                  said the little girl, pausing to look at a macaroon, and then finishing it with a
                  relish.</p>
               <p>The Italian laughed.</p>
               <p>"Canary-birds do not feed with crows," said he. "When we are rich, picciola, you
                  shall never eat worse than this."</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5676-00000069"/>
               <p>"Shall we be rich soon, 'Varny?" asked the child eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Upon the moment almost, if you will dance and laugh, and look so pretty as you
                  can, always."</p>
               <p>"But we needn't stop to be very rich before we go and carry some of the nice
                  things to mammy," rejoined Cherry anxiously.</p>
               <p>"No, no, indeed! We will but make a little turn in the country, and come back
                  princes. But mind you this, picciola: I am to be your father now, or all the same;
                  and I shall tell every one that you are my own little girl: so you must never say,
                  'Not so.'"</p>
               <p>"But mammy said my father was dead, and Teddy said so too. He was Michael
                  darlint."</p>
               <p>"I doubt not that Signor Michaelli died, and has gone to glory; but I strangely
                  doubt if he were thy father, picciola," said the Italian with a grave smile.
                  "However that may be, forget that you have ever had other father than me, and call
                  me so always: 'Mio padre,' you must say, and no more 'Varny. Also, too, you must
                  speak in Italian, as I shall to you; and never, as you do now, in English."</p>
               <p>"But mammy and Teddy don't know Italian," said Cherry, beginning to look a little
                  troubled.</p>
               <p>"'In Rome, do as the Romans do.' When you are again with the woman and boy, speak
                  as they speak: with me, speak as I speak."</p>
               <p>Giovanni said this more decidedly than he had ever spoken before, and Cherry
                  looked quickly up at him.</p>
               <p>"Is that the way you talk because you want to make believe you are my father?"
                  asked she.</p>
               <p>A sudden smile shot across the Italian's face, lighting its dark features like a
                  gleam of sunshine sweeping across a pine-clad mountain-land.</p>
               <p>"Shame were it to me, dear little heart, if to be thy father were to make thee
                  less happy than thou hast been with those others," said he softly in Italian, and
                  using the form of address, which, in almost every language but the English, marks
                  a different and more tender relation from that indicated by the more formal plural
                  pronoun.</p>
               <p>"You will be happy with me if we do not soon revisit these people we leave
                  behind?" asked he.</p>
               <p>The child's eyes grew large and deep as she fixed them upon his face, and
                  presently asked,—</p>
               <p>"Are you going with me to try to find heaven again?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps: who knows, picciola? The heaven you miss may come to you more easily if
                  you go to seek it. At any<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5676-00000070"/> rate, I will
                  carry thee no farther from it. But come: we must get to our journey."</p>
               <p>Leaving the confectioner's shop, Giovanni lingered no longer in the gay streets,
                  or even upon the fresh green grass of the Common, where Cherry would have staid to
                  play all day. Hurrying across it, and through some crowded streets, the Italian
                  entered a large station-house, where stood the train of cars, already half filled
                  with passengers; while the engine, puffing and panting with impatience, seemed
                  unwilling to wait a moment longer.</p>
               <p>Leaving Cherry in the ladies' room, the Italian bought his tickets, and reclaimed
                  from the baggage-room, where he had left it, his organ, with Pantalon chained to
                  the top of it. Then, calling the child, he hurried with her into the cars, and
                  selected a seat behind the door, in the evident wish of being seen as little as
                  possible.</p>
               <p>"Now, then, Ciriegia mia, we go to seek our fortune," said he, as the train left
                  the station, and began to rush through the suburbs of the city, scattering little
                  dirty children, vagrant dogs, leisurely pigs, and dawdling carriages driven by
                  honest old ladies, from its track.</p>
               <p>Cherry never had ridden in the cars before; and she clung tight to the sleeve of
                  her companion, afraid to move, or even to speak, until he laughingly asked,—</p>
               <p>"It does not fear, the poor little one, does it?"</p>
               <p>"No, I guess not, 'Varny," replied the child doubtfully; but the Italian sharply
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"What is this 'Varny you say? I am mio padre."</p>
               <p>"I forgot. Won't I tumble out of this carriage, my father, it goes so quick?"</p>
               <p>"Fear nothing, figlia mia. You are safe with me and with Pantalon," said the
                  Italian, drawing the little girl close to his side; while the monkey, crouching
                  upon the organ at their feet, chattered his own promises of protection and
                  comfort.</p>
               <p>With 'Toinette, to live was to love and trust; and, clinging close to her new
                  guardian's side, she laid her little shining head upon his breast, clinging with
                  one hand to the lappet of his coat; and, laughing down at Pantalon, she fell
                  presently asleep.</p>
               <p>At night the Italian left the train, and took lodgings at a hotel near the centre
                  of a large town. His little charge—tired, hungry, and sleepy—was very glad to have
                  supper, and to be allowed to go to bed, where she slept soundly until summoned the
                  next morning by Giovanni, who brought her some breakfast with his own hands, and,
                  placing it upon the table, laid a bundle of clothes beside it.</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5676-00000071"/>
               <p>"Rise and eat, carissima," said be gayly; "and then make thyself as beautiful as
                  the morning with these fine clothes. See, here are roses from the garden for a
                  wreath! They are better than the others. When thou art ready, come out to me."</p>
               <p>He left the room; and 'Toinette, rising, made a hasty breakfast; and then, putting
                  on the brocade-silk dress, and placing upon her head the wreath Giovanni had
                  twisted of natural flowers for her, she peeped into the glass, and laughed aloud
                  at the fanciful and beautiful image that met her eyes.</p>
               <p>"I am glad I look so pretty," murmured she, with an innocent delight at her own
                  beauty, that was not vanity, although, it might, if untrained, lead to it.</p>
               <p>"Come, Ciriegia, are you never ready?" called Giovanni from the other side of the
                  door; and Cherry, running to open it, exclaimed in Italian,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, see, my father! am I not beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"Truly so; but you should not say it, bambína. The charm of a maiden is her
                  modesty," said the Italian gravely.</p>
               <p>"But, if it is true, why mustn't I say so?" asked Cherry positively.</p>
               <p>"Many things that we know are never to be said, Ciriega. But come, now: you are to
                  dance first for these people, and they will make no charge for our beds and the
                  miserable provender they have given us."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Giovanni led the way to the lower hall of the hotel, where a number
                  of men were lounging, smoking, or talking; while through the open doors of the
                  parlor and office were to be seen some ladies and gentlemen, idling away the hour
                  after breakfast, before proceeding to their business, their journey, or their
                  amusement.</p>
               <p>Placing himself in the centre of the hall, Giovanni, with a bow to the company,
                  played a little prelude, and then struck into the lively strains of the
                  cachuca.</p>
               <p>Cherry, who had stood looking at him, her head slightly bent, her lips apart, eyes
                  and ears alert to catch the signal to begin, pointed her little foot at the
                  precise moment, and, holding her dress in the tips of her slender fingers, slid
                  into the movement with a grace and accuracy never to be attained except by
                  vigorous practice, or a temperament as sensitive to time and tune, limbs as
                  supple, and impulses as graceful, as were those of this gifted and unfortunate
                  child.</p>
               <p>"See there!—the poor little thing!" exclaimed one<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000072"/> of the ladies, who came to the door of the
                  drawing-room to see the performance.</p>
               <p>"How can you say poor little thing?" asked another. "Don't you see how she enjoys
                  it herself? That smile is not the artificial grimace of a ballet-dancer; and no
                  eyes ever sparkled so joyously to order."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she does enjoy it; but all the more 'Poor little thing!' say I," rejoined
                  the first speaker, adding thoughtfully, "What sort of training for a woman is
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, well! but it is very pretty to see her; and she would probably be running in
                  the streets, or doing worse, if she did not dance; and so little as she is! It is
                  equal to the theatre."</p>
               <p>The speaker drew out her purse as she spoke, and carelessly threw a dollar-bill
                  towards the child, who had finished her dance, and stood looking round with an
                  innocent smile, as if asking for applause rather than reward.</p>
               <p>"Go and take it, carissima; and then hold your hand to the others; each will give
                  you something," said Giovanni in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"How much we shall have to carry to mammy!" exclaimed the child eagerly; and, as
                  she gathered in her harvest, she chattered away, always in Italian,—</p>
               <p>"And more, and more, and more ! O my father! how many cents they give me! What
                  nice people they are! Let me dance some more for them; and let Pantalon come down,
                  and let them see him."</p>
               <p>" No, no, child! These are not of those who would care for Pantalon. While you
                  rest by and by, I shall take him and the organ, and go about the streets; but your
                  little feet are worth many Pantalons to me. Come, we will give them the tarantella
                  as they have done so well."</p>
               <p>Skipping to his side, with a childish grace more attractive than the studied
                  movements of the most accomplished actress, Cherry stuffed the proceeds of her
                  first attempt into the pocket of her guardian, and then, throwing herself into
                  position, went through the wild and grotesque movements of the tarantella, with a
                  life and freshness that drew from the spectators a burst of applause and
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"That will do. We must not give them too much at once, lest the wonder come to an
                  end. Make the pretty kiss of the hand, figlia mia, and run up the stairs to your
                  own little room."</p>
               <p>Cherry obeyed, calling back, as she disappeared, "Tell them I will dance some more
                  for them by and by if they want me to."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">WHOLESALE MURDER.</head>
               <p>IN the course of that day, Giovanni and his little <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >danseuse</foreign> visited all the principal public places in the town, and
                  also several of the best private houses; and, at all, the performances of the
                  child called forth the surprise, delight, and admiration of those who witnessed
                  them. Nor were more substantial proofs of their approval wanting; so that at
                  night, when Giovanni counted up his gains, he found them so large, that he cried,
                  while embracing poor weary little Cherry,—</p>
               <p>"O blessed, blessed moment when thou didst cross my path, Ciriegia carissima!"</p>
               <p>"Now can't we go home to mammy? I am so tired, and my head feels sick!" moaned the
                  child, laying the poor aching little head upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Giovanni looked down at the pale face, and, meeting the languid eyes, felt a pang
                  of conscience and pity.</p>
               <p>"Thou art tired, bambína povera mia," said he kindly. "Another day, we will be
                  more careful. Lie down now, and sleep for a while. We go again in the
                  steam-carriage to-night."</p>
               <p>Cherry climbed upon the bed without reply, and in a moment was fast asleep. The
                  Italian drew the coverings about her, and stooped to kiss the pale cheek, where
                  showed already a dark circle beneath the eye, and a painful contraction at the
                  corner of the mouth.</p>
               <p>"Poveracita!" murmured he. "But soon we will have money enough to go home to the
                  father-land, and then all will be well with her as with me."</p>
               <p>Three hours later, he came to arouse the child, and prepare her to renew the
                  journey.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am so tired! I want to sleep some more so bad, 'Varny!—no, my father, I
                  mean. I don't want to go somewhere," said she piteously, closing her eyes, and
                  struggling to lay her head again upon the pillow. Giovanni hesitated for a moment;
                  and then, never knowing that the decision was one of life and death, the question
                  of a whole future career, he determined to pursue his plan in spite of that
                  plaintive entreaty, and, hastily wrapping a shawl about the child, took her in his
                  arms, and carried her down stairs. The organ and Pantalon waited in the hall
                  below; and<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5676-00000074"/> Giovanni, setting Cherry
                  upon her feet, shouldered the organ and, taking the little girl by the hand, led
                  her out into the quiet street, where lay the light of a full moon, making the
                  night more beautiful than day. Cherry's drowsy eyes flew wide open; and, looking
                  up in Giovanni's face with eager joy, she cried,—</p>
               <p>"Oh! now we're going back to heaven; aren't we, my father? It was bright and still
                  like this in heaven; and I saw a star, and—and then the naughty lady struck
                  me"—</p>
               <p>"Peace, little one! I know not of what you speak, nor any thing of heaven," said
                  the Italian in a troubled voice; and the child, hurrying along at his side, raised
                  her face silently to the summer sky, seeking there, perhaps, the answer to the
                  questions forever stirring in her struggling soul.</p>
               <p>A little later, and the swift train, flying through the sleeping land, bore away
                  the travellers; while Giovanni, settling himself as easily as possible, laid the
                  head of his little Ciriegia upon his breast, tenderly smoothed down her silky
                  curls, and laid his hand upon the bright eyes, that frightened him with the
                  intensity of their gaze.</p>
               <p>"Sleep, carissima mia, sleep," murmured he soothingly; "sleep, and forget thy
                  weariness and thy memories."</p>
               <p>"I can't sleep now, my father. It seems to me that we are going to heaven; and I
                  want to be awake to see—the lady"—</p>
               <p>The words faltered, and died upon her lips. The beautiful image of her mother,
                  fading slowly from her memory, seemed already a vision so vague, that to name it
                  were to lose it,—an idea too precious and too impalpable to put in words. The
                  past, with all its love and joy and beauty, was becoming for our 'Toinette what we
                  may fancy heaven is to a little baby, whose solemn eyes and earnest gaze seem
                  forever attempting to recall the visions of celestial beauty it has left for the
                  pale, sad skies, and mournful sounds of earth.</p>
               <p>On rushed the train through the quiet night, waking wild echoes in the woods, and
                  leaving them to whisper themselves again to sleep when it had passed; lighting
                  dark valleys that the moonlight left unlighted, with its whirling banner of flame
                  and sparks, and its hundred blazing windows; moving across the holy calm of
                  midnight like some strange and troubled vision, some ugly nightmare, that for the
                  moment changes peace and rest to horror and affright, and then passes again to the
                  dim and ghostly Dreamland, whose frontier crowds our daily life on every hand, and
                  whence forever<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5676-00000075"/> peep and beckon the
                  mysteries that perplex and haunt the human mind.</p>
               <p>On and on and on, through misty lowland and shadowy wood, and over shining rivers,
                  and through sleeping hamlets, and winding, snake-like, between great round hills
                  and along deep mountain-gorges, until the wild, bright eyes that watched beneath
                  Cherry's matted curls grew soft and dim; and at last the white lids fell, and the
                  curve of the sad lips relaxed beneath the kiss of God's mildest messenger to
                  man,—the spirit of sleep.</p>
               <p>As for Giovanni, he long had slumbered heavily; and even Pantalon, whose bright
                  eyes were seldom known to close, was now curled up beneath the organ-covering,
                  dreaming, perhaps, of the nut-groves and spice-islands where he had once known
                  liberty and youth.</p>
               <p>Just then it came,—a crash as if heaven and earth had met; a wild, deep cry, made
                  up of all tones of human agony and fright; the shriek of escaping steam; the
                  rending and splintering of wood and iron; destruction, terror, pain, and death,
                  all mingled in one awful moment. Then those who had escaped unhurt began the sad
                  and terrible task of withdrawing from the ruin the maimed and bleeding bodies of
                  those who yet lived, the crushed remains and fragments of those who had been
                  killed in the moment of the encounter: and, in all the bewildering confusion of
                  the scene, none had eyes for the little childish figure, that, hurled from the
                  splintered car, lay for a while stunned and shaken among the soft grass where it
                  had fallen, and then, staggering to its feet, fled wildly away into the dim
                  forest-land.</p>

               <head type="sub">DORA DARLING.</head>
               <p>THE sun was setting upon the day succeeding that of the great railroad accident,
                  that, for weeks, filled the whole land with horror and indignation, when a young
                  girl, driving rapidly along a country-road at a point about five miles distant
                  from the scene of the disaster, met a child walking slowly toward her, whose
                  disordered dress, bare head, and wild, sweet face, attracted her attention and
                  curiosity.</p>
               <p>Checking her spirited horse with some difficulty, the young girl looked back, and
                  found that the child had stopped, and stood watching her.</p>
               <p>"See here, little girl!" called she. "Are you lost? Is any thing the matter with
                  you?"</p>
               <p>The child fixed her solemn eyes upon the face of the questioner, but made no
                  answer.</p>
               <p>"Come here, sissy! I want to talk to you; and I can't turn round to come to you.
                  Come here!"</p>
               <p>The little girl slowly obeyed the kind command, and stood presently beside the
                  wagon, her pale face upraised, her startled eyes intently fixed upon the clear and
                  honest ones bent to meet them.</p>
               <p>"What is your name, little girl?"</p>
               <p>"Sunshine," said the child vaguely; and her eyes dropped from the face of her
                  questioner to fix themselves upon the far horizon, where hung already the
                  evening-star, pale and trembling, as it had hung upon the evening of 'Toinette
                  Legrange's birthday ten months before. Was it a sudden association with the star
                  and the hour that had suggested to the heart of the desolate child this name, so
                  long forgotten, once so appropriate, now so strange and sad?</p>
               <p>"Sunshine?" replied the young girl wonderingly. "You don't look like it a bit.
                  Where do you belong? and where are you going?"</p>
               <p>The child's eyes travelled back from Dreamland, and rested wistfully upon the kind
                  face above her.</p>
               <p>"I don't know," said she sadly. "I want to go to heaven; but I've forgot the
                  way."</p>
               <p>"To heaven! You poor little thing, have you no home short of that?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know. I wish I had some water."</p>
               <p>"You had better jump into the wagon, and come home<pb n="152-153"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000077"/> with me, Sunshine, if that is your name. Something
                  has got to be done for you right away."</p>
               <p>The child, still looking at her in that strange and solemn manner, asked
                  suddenly,—</p>
               <p>"Who are you?"</p>
               <p>"I? Oh! I'm Dora Darling; and I live about five miles from here. Jump in quick;
                  for it is growing dark, and we must be at home for supper."</p>
               <p>As she spoke, she leaned down, and gave a hand to the little girl, who
                  mechanically took it, and clambered into the carriage. Dora lifted her to the
                  seat, and held her there, with one arm about her waist, saying kindly,—</p>
               <p>"Hug right up to me, you poor little thing! and hold on tight. We'll be at home in
                  half an hour, or less.—Now, Pope!"</p>
               <p>The impatient horse, feeling the loosened rein, and hearing his own name, darted
                  away at speed; whirling the light wagon along so rapidly, that the child clung
                  convulsively to her new protector, murmuring,—</p>
               <p>"I guess I shall spill out of this, and get kilt."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, you won't, Sunshine! I shall hold you in. You're not Irish, are you?"</p>
               <p>"What's that?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Irish, you know. You said 'kilt' just now, instead of 'killed,' as we
                  do."</p>
               <p>The child made no reply; but her head drooped upon Dora's shoulder yet more
                  heavily, and her eyes closed.</p>
               <p>"Are you sick, little girl? or only tired?" asked Dora, looking anxiously down
                  into the colorless face, over which the evening breeze was gently strewing the
                  tangled curls, as if to hide it from mortal view, while the poor, worn, spirit
                  fled away to peace and rest.</p>
               <p>"Sunshine!" exclaimed Dora, gently moving the heavy head that still drooped lower
                  and lower, until now the face was hidden from view.</p>
               <p>"She has fainted!" said Dora, looking anxiously about her. No house and no person
                  were in sight, nor any stream or pond of water; and the young girl decided that
                  the wisest course would be to drive home as rapidly as possible, postponing all
                  attempt to revive her little patient until her arrival there.</p>
               <p>Without checking the horse, she dragged from under the seat a quilted
                  carriage-robe, and spread it in the bottom of the wagon, arranging a paper parcel
                  as a pillow. Then, laying poor Sunshine upon this extemporized couch, she took off
                  her own light shawl, and covered her; leaving<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000078"/> exposed only the face, white and lovely as the
                  marble statue recumbent upon a little maiden's tomb.</p>
               <p>"Now, Pope!" cried Dora, with one touch of the whip upon the glossy haunch of the
                  powerful beast, who, at sound of that clear voice, neighed reply, and darted
                  forward at the rate of twelve good miles an hour; so that, in considerably less
                  than the promised time, Dora skilfully turned the corner from the road into a
                  green country lane, and, a few moments after, stopped before the door of an
                  old-fashioned one-story farm-house, painted red, with a long roof sloping to the
                  ground at the back, an open well with a sweep and bucket, and a diamond-paned
                  dairy-window swinging to and fro in the faint breeze. Around the irregular
                  door-stone, the grass grew close and green; while nodding in at the window, and
                  waving from the low eaves, and clambering upon the roof, a tangle of white and
                  sweet-brier roses, of woodbine and maiden's-bower, lent a rare grace to the simple
                  home, and loaded the air with a cloud of delicate perfume.</p>
               <p>A young man, lounging upon the doorstep, started to his feet as the wagon came
                  dashing up the lane, and was going to open the gate of the barn-yard; but Dora
                  stopped before the open door, and called to him,—</p>
               <p>"Karl! Come here, please."</p>
               <p>"Certainly. I was running out of the way for fear of being ground to powder
                  beneath your chariot-wheels; for I said to myself, 'Surely the driving is as the
                  driving of Jehu, the son of Nimshi.'"</p>
               <p>"I shouldn't have driven so fast; but—see here!"</p>
               <p>She pulled away the shawl as she spoke, and showed to the young man, who now stood
                  beside the carriage, the still inanimate form of the little waif at her feet.</p>
               <p>"Phew! What's that? and where did you get it?"</p>
               <p>"A little girl that I met; lost, I think. I took her into the buggy, and then she
                  fainted, and I laid her down," rapidly explained Dora; adding, as she raised the
                  little figure in her arms,—</p>
               <p>"Take her in, and lay her on the bed in the rosy-room."</p>
               <p>"Poor little thing! She's not dead, is she, Dora?" asked the young man softly, as
                  he took the child in his arms and entered the house, followed by Dora.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! I think not; only fainted. I suppose there's hot water, for a bath, in
                  the kitchen."</p>
               <p>As she spoke, they entered the sitting-room,—a cool, shady apartment, with a great
                  beam crossing the ceilings, and deep recesses to the windows, with seats in
                  them.</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5676-00000079"/>
               <p>At the farther side, Dora threw open the door of a little bedroom, whose
                  gay-papered walls and flowered chintz furniture, not to speak of a great
                  sweet-brier bush tapping and scratching at the window, with all its thousand sharp
                  little fingers, gave it a good right to be called the rosy-room. Dora hastily drew
                  away the bright counterpane, and nodded to Karl, who laid the little form he
                  carried tenderly upon the bed.</p>
               <p>At this moment, another door into the sitting-room opened; and a girl, somewhat
                  older than Dora, put in her head, looked about for a moment, and then came
                  curiously toward the door of the rosy-room.</p>
               <p>"I thought I heard you, Dora," said she. "What are you doing in here? Why!—who's
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"O Kitty! can you warm a little of that broth we had for dinner, to give her?
                  She's just starved, I really believe. And is there any ammonia in the
                  house?—smelling-salts, you know. Didn't aunt have some?" asked Dora rapidly.</p>
               <p>"I believe so. But where did you get this child? Who is she?"</p>
               <p>"Run, Kitty, and get the salts first. We'll tell you afterward."</p>
               <p>"What shall <emph>I</emph> do, Dora?" interposed the young man; and Kitty ran upon
                  her errand, while Dora promptly replied,—</p>
               <p>"Open the window, and bring some cold water; and then a little wine or brandy, if
                  we have any."</p>
               <p>"Enough for this time, at any rate," said Karl, hurrying away, and returning with
                  both water and wine just as Kitty appeared with the salts; but it was Dora who
                  applied the remedies, and with a skill and steadiness that would have seemed
                  absolutely marvellous to one unacquainted with the young girl's previous history
                  and training.</p>
               <p>"She's coming to herself. You'd better both go out of sight, and let her see only
                  me. Kitty, will you look to the broth?" whispered Dora; and Karl, taking his
                  sister by the sleeve, led her out, softly closing the door after them.</p>
               <p>"Dora does like to manage, I must say. Now, do tell me at last who this child is,
                  and where she came from, and what's going to be done with her," said Kitty as they
                  reached the kitchen. "Why shouldn't she like to manage, when she can do it so
                  well? I can tell you, Miss Kitty, if she hadn't managed<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000080"/> aged to some purpose on one occasion, you wouldn't
                  have had a brother to-day to plague you."</p>
               <p>The girl's dark eyes grew moist as she turned them upon him, saying warmly,—</p>
               <p>"I know it, Charley; and I would love her for that, if nothing else: but I can't
                  forget she's almost a year younger than I am, and ought not to expect to take the
                  lead in every thing."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, Kit-cat, don't be ridiculous! Get the soup, and put it over the fire; and
                  I'll tell you all I know about our little guest."</p>
               <p>"I let the fire go down when tea was ready, it is so warm to-night," said Kitty,
                  raking away the ashes in the open fireplace, and drawing together a few coals.</p>
               <p>"That will do. You only want a cupful or so at once, and you can warm it in a
                  saucepan over those coals."</p>
               <p>"Dear me! I guess I know how to do as much as that without telling. Sit down now,
                  and let me hear about the child."</p>
               <p>So Karl dropped into the wooden arm-chair beside the hearth, and told his story;
                  while Kitty, bustling about, warmed the broth, moved the tea-pot and covered dish
                  of toast nearer to the remnant of fire, waved a few flies off the neat tea-table,
                  and drove out an intrusive chicken, who, before going to roost, was evidently
                  determined to secure a dainty bit for supper from the saucer of bread and milk set
                  in the corner for pussy.</p>
               <p>"If the broth is ready, I'll take it in," said Karl, as his sister removed it from
                  the fire.</p>
               <p>"Well, here it is; and do tell Dora to come to supper, or at least come yourself.
                  I want to get cleared away some time."</p>
               <p>"I'll tell her," said Karl briefly, as he took the bowl of broth, set it in a
                  plate, and laid a silver spoon beside it.</p>
               <p>"How handy he is! just like a woman," said Kitty to herself as her brother left
                  the room; and then, going out into the sink-room, she finished washing and putting
                  away the "milk-things,"—a process interrupted by the arrival of Dora with her
                  little charge.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">A CHAMBER OF MEMORIES.</head>
               <p>"How is she now, Dora?" asked Karl, softly opening the door of the rosy-room.</p>
               <p>"Better. You can come in if you want to. Have you got the broth?"</p>
               <p>"Yes: here it is."</p>
               <p>"That's nice. Now hold her up, please, this way, while I feed her. See, little
                  Sunshine! here is some nice broth for you. Take a little, won't you?"</p>
               <p>The pale lips slightly opened, and Dora deftly slipped the spoon between them. The
                  effect was instantaneous; and, as the half-starved child tasted and smelled the
                  nourishing food, she opened wide her eyes, and, fixing them upon the cup,
                  nervously worked her lips, and half extended her poor little hands, wasted and
                  paled by even two days of privation and fatigue.</p>
               <p>"I tell you what, Dora, this child has had a mighty narrow chance of it," said
                  Karl aside, as Dora patiently administered the broth, waiting a moment between
                  each spoonful.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied she softly. "I am so glad I met her! it was a real providence."</p>
               <p>"For her?"</p>
               <p>"For me as much," returned Dora simply. "It is so pleasant to be able to do
                  something again!"</p>
               <p>"You miss your wounded and invalid soldiers, and find it very dull here," said
                  Karl quickly, as he glanced sharply into the open face of the young girl.</p>
               <p>"Hush, Karl! don't talk now: it will disturb her. Is tea ready?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and Kitty sent word for you to come. Run along, and I will stay with the
                  chick till you come back."</p>
               <p>"No: I can't leave her yet. You go to supper, and perhaps, when you are done, I
                  will leave you with her; or Kitty can stay, and I will clear away."</p>
               <p>"Won't you let me stay now?" asked the young man hesitatingly.</p>
               <p>"No. Here, take the bowl, and run along."</p>
               <p>"'Just as you say, not as I like,' I suppose," said Karl, laughing; and, taking
                  the bowl, he went softly out.</p>
               <p>"Now, little girl, you feel better, don't you?" asked<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000082"/> Dora cheerily, as she laid the heavy head back upon
                  the pillow, and tenderly smoothed away the tangled hair.</p>
               <p>"Si, signora," murmured Giovanni's pupil.</p>
               <p>"What's that? I don't know what you mean. Say it again, won't you?"</p>
               <p>But the child only fixed her dreamy eyes upon the face of the questioner, with no
                  effort at reply; and then the lids began slowly to close.</p>
               <p>"Now, before you go to sleep, Sunshine, I am going to take you up stairs, and put
                  you in my own bed, because I sha'n't want to leave you alone to-night; and no one
                  sleeps here. Wait till I fold this shawl round you, and then pull your arms about
                  my neck. There: now we'll go."</p>
               <p>She lifted the child as she spoke, and carried her again into the front entry, and
                  up the square staircase to a cottage-chamber with white, scoured floor, common
                  pine furniture, the cheapest of white earthern toilet-sets, and nothing of expense
                  or luxury to be found within its four whitewashed walls, and yet a room that gave
                  one a feeling of satisfaction and peace not always inhabiting far wider and more
                  costly chambers: for the little bed was artistically composed, and covered with
                  snow-white dimity, as was the table between the windows, and the cushion of the
                  wooden rocking-chair; while curtains of the same material, escaped from their
                  tri-colored fastenings, floated in upon the soft breeze like great sails, or the
                  draperies of twilight spirits departing before mortal presence.</p>
               <p>In the fireplace stood a large pitcher, filled with common flowers, fresh and
                  odorous; and upon the high mantle-shelf, and all around the room, was disposed a
                  collection of the oddest ornaments that ever decked a young girl's
                  sleeping-chamber. Among them we will but pause to mention two muskets, the one
                  bent, the other splintered at the stock; four swords, each more or less disabled;
                  an officer's sash; three sets of shoulder-straps; a string of army-buttons, each
                  with a name written upon a strip of paper, and tied to the eye; two or three dozen
                  bone rings, of more or less elaborate workmanship, disposed upon the branches of a
                  little tree carved of pine; a large collection of crosses, hearts, clasped hands,
                  dogs'-heads, and other trinkets, in bone, some white, and some stained black; a
                  careful drawing of a crooked and grotesque old negro, in a frame of carved wood;
                  and, finally, a suit of clothes hung against the wall in the position of a human
                  figure, consisting of a jaunty scarlet cap, with a little flag of the United
                  States fastened to the front by an army-badge; a basque, skirt,<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000083"/> and trousers of blue cloth, with a worn and clumsy
                  pair of boots below. From a belt fastened across the waist hung a little barrel, a
                  flask, and by a wide ribbon of red, white and blue, a boatswain's silver
                  whistle.</p>
               <p>Singular ornaments, we have said, for a young girl's sleeping-room, and yet, in
                  this case, touchingly appropriate and harmonious: for they were the keepsakes
                  given to the daughter of the regiment by the six hundred brave men, who each loved
                  her as his own; they were the mementoes of a year in Dora Darling's life, of such
                  vivid experiences that it threatened to make all the years that should come after
                  pale and vapid in comparison.</p>
               <p>Just now, however, all the girl's strong sympathies were aroused and glowing; and
                  as she tenderly cared for the child so strangely placed within her hands, and
                  finally laid her to sleep in the clover-scented sheets of the fair white bed, she
                  felt happier than she had for months before.</p>
               <p>A light tap at the door, and Kitty entered.</p>
               <p>"I'll stay with her while you go and eat supper. Charles said he'd come; but I'd
                  like well enough to sit down a little while. My!—she's pretty-looking; isn't
                  she?"</p>
               <p>"The prettiest child I ever saw," replied Dora, with her usual decision; and then
                  the two girls stood for a moment looking down at the delicate little face, where,
                  since the food and broth Dora had administered, a bright color showed itself upon
                  the cheeks and lips; while the short, thick curls, carefully brushed, clustered
                  around the white forehead, defining its classic shape, and contrasting with its
                  pearly tints.</p>
               <p>"Who can she be?" asked Kitty in a whisper.</p>
               <p>"Some sort of foreigner,—French maybe, or perhaps Italian. She has talked
                  considerably since I gave her the broth; but I can't make out a word she says. She
                  spoke English when I first met her; but I don't believe she knows much of it,"
                  said Dora thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"There is something sewed up in a little bag, and hung round her neck," added she,
                  "just such as some of our foreign volunteers had,—a sort of charm, you know, to
                  keep them from being struck by the evil eye. That shows that her friends must have
                  been foreigners."</p>
               <p>"Yes; and Catholics too, likely enough," said Kitty rather contemptuously; adding,
                  after a pause,—</p>
               <p>"Well, you go down, and I'll sit by her a while. If she sleeps as sound as this, I
                  don't suppose I need stay a great while. There's the supper-dishes to do."</p>
               <p>"I'll wash them, of course; but, if you want to come<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000084"/> down, you might leave the door open at the head of
                  the back stairs, and I should hear if she called or cried. And, now I think of it,
                  I have a letter to show Karl and you. I got it at the post-office."</p>
               <p>"From Mr. Brown?" asked Kitty quickly.</p>
               <p>"No, from a Mr. Burroughs; a man I never heard of in my life till to-day. But come
                  down in a few minutes, and I will read it to you."</p>
               <p>"Well, don't read it till I come."</p>
               <p>"No: I won't." And Dora quietly went out of the room, leaving Kitty to swing
                  backward and forward in the white-cushioned rocking-chair, her dark eyes wandering
                  half contemptuously, half enviously, over Dora's collection of treasures, with an
                  occasional glance at the sleeping child.</p>

               <head type="sub">A LETTER AND AN OFFER.</head>
               <p>IN the kitchen, Dora found Karl waiting for her; and, while she eat her supper
                  with the healthy relish of a young and vigorous creature, she gave her cousin an
                  account of all the circumstances attending her meeting with the little girl, whom
                  she described again as a foreigner, and probably French.</p>
               <p>"And what's to be done with her, Dora?" asked the young man rather gravely, when
                  she had finished.</p>
               <p>"Why, when she is well enough to tell who she is, and where she came from,—that
                  is, if she can talk English at all,—we can return her to her friends; or, if they
                  are not to be discovered, I will keep her myself. That is,"—and the young girl
                  paused suddenly, the blood rushing to her face, as she added,—" that is, if you
                  and Kitty are willing. It is your house, not mine; though I'm afraid I am apt to
                  forget."</p>
               <p>Karl looked at her reproachfully.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5676-00000085"/>
               <p>"When I brought you here, Dora Darling, I brought you home; and when my mother
                  died, not yet a year ago, did she not bid us live together as brother and sisters,
                  in love and harmony?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; but"—</p>
               <p>"But what, Dora?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid sometimes I behave too much as if it were my own house," faltered
                  Dora.</p>
               <p>"And so it is your own house, just as it is my own and Kitty's own. Have either of
                  us ever made you feel that there was any difference, or that you had less right
                  here than we?"</p>
               <p>Dora made no reply; and, while Karl still waited for one the staircase-door opened
                  softly, and Kitty appeared.</p>
               <p>"The child is fast asleep," said she: "so I thought I would come down and hear the
                  letter."</p>
               <p>"What letter?" asked Karl a little impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I haven't told you. Here it is."</p>
               <p>And Dora drew from her pocket, and held toward him, a large white envelope, boldly
                  directed to <q>"Miss DORA DARLING, care of Capt. Charles Windsor"</q>
               </p>
               <p>"That's nonsense. I have beaten my sword into a ploughshare now, and am only plain
                  mister," said Capt. Karl, glancing at the direction.</p>
               <p>"Well, read the letter, do; I'm dying to hear it," said Kitty impatiently; and her
                  brother, with an affectation of extreme haste, unfolded the thick, large sheet of
                  note-paper and read aloud:—</p>
               <p>"Having been requested to communicate with Miss Darling upon a matter of
                  importance, Mr. Thomas Burroughs will do himself the honor of calling upon her,
                  probably in the afternoon of Thursday, Aug. 25.</p>
               <p>"CINCINNATI, Aug. 20."</p>
               <p>"Thursday, 25th! Why, that is to-morrow!" exclaimed Karl, as he finished
                  reading.</p>
               <p>"Dated Cincinnati, you see! It is some message from Mr. Brown. He lives about
                  twenty miles from Cincinnati," said Kitty eagerly.</p>
               <p>"I don't think so. Why should Mr. Brown send a message when he writes to me so
                  often?" replied Dora with simplicity.</p>
               <p>"I should think he did. I suppose you expected a letter this afternoon, and that
                  was what made you so bent upon driving to town in all the heat."</p>
               <p>"It wasn't very hot, and you know we needed these things from the shop."</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5676-00000086"/>
               <p>"From the grocery-store, do you mean?" asked Kitty sharply.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Why can't you talk as we do, then? You have been here long enough now, I should
                  think."</p>
               <p>"Because she knows how to talk better, Miss Kit," said Karl good-humoredly.
                  "Calling a shop a store is an Americanism, like calling a station-house a dépôt,
                  or trousers pants."</p>
               <p>"Well, I thought we were Americans, Dora and all," retorted Kitty.</p>
               <p>"Mercy, child! don't let us plunge from philology into ethnology. I prefer to
                  speculate upon Mr. Thomas Burroughs. Who is he? and what does he want of our
                  Dora?"</p>
               <p>"To marry her, I suppose, or to ask her to marry Mr. Brown," snapped Kitty.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he wants to ask my good word toward marrying you," suggested Dora,
                  coloring deeply.</p>
               <p>"No such good luck as that, eh, Kitty?" said Karl with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"Good luck! I'm sure I'm in no hurry to be married; and, though I haven't had
                  Dora's chances of seeing all sorts of men, I dare say I shall get as good a
                  husband in the end," replied Kitty loftily.</p>
               <p>"But, contemplating for one moment the idea that it may not be an offer of
                  marriage that Mr. Thomas Burroughs means by a 'matter of importance,' let us
                  consider what else it can be," said Karl with a quizzical smile.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he wants your ideas upon the campaign in Western Virginia, and a report
                  of the general's real motives and intentions," suggested Dora gayly.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he wants to engage his winter's butter; though I don't believe Dora is
                  the one to ask about that," said Kitty.</p>
               <p>"Now, Kitty! I'm sure I made up the last, and you said it was as nice as you could
                  do yourself."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but you turned all the buttermilk into the pig's pail instead of saving it
                  for biscuits."</p>
               <p>"So I did. Well, as dear old Picter used to say, 'What's the use ob libin' if
                  you've got trew larnin'?'"</p>
               <p>"O Dora! how can you, how can you!—you cruel, cruel girl, how can you speak of
                  him!" cried Kitty in a passion of anger and grief; and, pushing back her chair so
                  violently as to upset it, she rushed out of the room.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am so sorry!" exclaimed Dora in great distress; and would have followed
                  her, had not Karl held her back.</p>
               <p>"Don't go, dear; it will be of no use: she will not let<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000087"/> you into her room. Poor Kitty! she loved her mother
                  so passionately, and her nature is so intense! We must make great excuses, Dora,
                  for our sister's little inequalities of temper: I think her great loss is at the
                  bottom of all."</p>
               <p>Dora looked thoughtful, and presently said slowly, "I know it, Karl; but it does
                  seem to me rather unjust that she should hate poor Pic's memory so bitterly even
                  now. He did not know any more than I that he had small-pox when he came back that
                  time from New York; and when Kitty told him that Aunt Lucy had taken it from him,
                  and was very sick, he felt so badly, that I think it prevented his getting
                  well."</p>
               <p>"O Dora, don't say that! Kitty could not have blamed him openly."</p>
               <p>"I don't know what she said; but, from that day, he grew worse, and died without
                  being able to bid me good-by,—Pic, who brought me away from those cruel people,
                  and cared for me as if I had been his child. O dear, dear old Pic!"</p>
               <p>She did not cry; she very seldom did: but she clasped her hands tightly together,
                  and looked so white and wild, that Karl came to her, and, taking her in his arms,
                  would have soothed and caressed her like a little child, had not she repulsed
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Please not, dear Karl! I must bear my griefs alone for I am alone in all the
                  world."</p>
               <p>It was the bitterest sentence Dora had ever spoken, and her cousin looked at her
                  in dismay.</p>
               <p>"If Picter could have given the disease to me instead of to aunt, and he and I
                  could have journeyed on together into another world as we had through this, and
                  left your mother to Kitty and you!" continued Dora; while in her eyes, and about
                  her white lips, quivered a passion of grief far beyond any tears,—far beyond,
                  thank God! any grief that eyes and lips so young are often called to express. And
                  as it rose and swelled in her girl heart, and shook her strong young soul, Dora
                  uttered in one word all the bitterness of her orphaned life.</p>
               <p>"Mother!" cried she, and clinched her hands above the sharp pain that seemed to
                  suffocate her, the pain we call heart-ache, and might sometimes more justly call
                  heart-break.</p>
               <p>Karl looked at her, and his gay young face grew strong, and full of meaning. He
                  folded her again in his arms, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Dora, I had not meant to speak yet; but I cannot see you so, or hear you say such
                  words. Do not you know,<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5676-00000088"/> cousin, that
                  there is nothing in all the world I love like you; and that, while I live, you can
                  never be alone; and, while I have a home, you can never want one, or be other than
                  its head and centre? Dora, marry me, and I will make you forget all other loves in
                  the excess of mine." Dora allowed her head to droop upon his shoulder, and a
                  sudden sense of peace and rest fell temptingly upon her spirit.</p>
               <p>"Dora, Dora Darling always, even when you are all my Dora!" whispered Karl; but
                  Dora released herself from his arms, and stood upright. Her face was strong again
                  now, although very white; and she said,—</p>
               <p>"Thank you, cousin. You are good and kind, as you always have been, and I am glad
                  you love me as I love you; but what else you have said we will forget. I am too
                  young to think of such things, and you will not feel so to-morrow or next day. Be
                  my brother, as you have been, and let me be sister to you and Kitty, as aunt told
                  us. I wish I could make Kitty love me."</p>
               <p>The young man would have persisted; but Dora, gravely shaking her head, said,—</p>
               <p>"Karl dear, you only distress me, and I want to be quiet. Do not speak of this
                  again for at least another year, and then, perhaps, you will not want to."</p>
               <p>"But in a year I may, if I do want to?" asked Karl eagerly.</p>
               <p>"I don't want to say that; for I don't know that I should want you to then," said
                  Dora, with such exquisite simplicity, that the young man laughed outright, and
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"But you don't know that you sha'n't, do you, darling Dorelle?"</p>
               <p>"I didn't say so."</p>
               <p>"No; but— Well, I won't insist; only I shall put down the date. Let me see: Aug.
                  24, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>He took out his note-book, wrote a few words, and, glancing at Dora with a
                  suppressed smile, put it away again. Then, more seriously, he took her hand,
                  saying,—</p>
               <p>"Only remember one thing, Dora; and that is, whatever may come in the future, this
                  house is your home as long as it is ours; and, while I live, there is always some
                  one who loves you best of all God's creatures."</p>

               <head type="sub">GIOVANNI'S ROOM.</head>
               <p>"OCHONE! an' it's weary work climbin' thim stairs," groaned Mrs. Ginniss, pausing
                  upon the landing outside the organ-grinder's door.</p>
               <p>"An' mabbe she's wid him still. Anyway, I'll see, and save the coomin' down
                  agin."</p>
               <p>With these words, Mrs. Ginniss gave a modest rap upon the door, and, as it
                  remained unanswered, a somewhat louder one, calling at the same time,—</p>
               <p>"Misther Jovarny! Misther Jovarny, I say! Is it out yees still are?"</p>
               <p>The question remaining unanswered, the good woman waited no longer, but, climbing
                  the remaining flight of stairs took the key of her room from the shelf in Teddy's
                  closet where it had been left, and unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>"Cherry, darlint, be ye widin?" asked she, throwing it open; and then,
                  recollecting herself, added,—</p>
               <p>"An' sure how could she, be, widout she kim in trew the kayhole? But, blissid
                  Vargin! where would they be all the day long?"</p>
               <p>So saying, Mrs. Ginniss threw up the window, and looked anxiously down the street
                  in the direction where Giovanni and Cherry had that morning disappeared.</p>
               <p>Nothing was to be seen of them; but, just turning the corner, came Teddy, his
                  straw-hat pushed back upon his forehead, and his steps slow and undecided. He was
                  thinking wearily, as he often thought of late, that the time had come when he
                  could no longer withhold his little sister from the friends to whom she really
                  belonged; and it was not alone the heat of the August night that brought the great
                  drops of perspiration to the boy's forehead, or drew the white line around his
                  mouth.</p>
               <p>"It's quicker nor that you'll stip, my b'y, whin you hear the little sisther's not
                  in yit, an' it's wid Jovarny she is," muttered Mrs. Ginniss; and, half dreading
                  the entrance of her son, she applied herself so diligently to making a fire in
                  preparation for supper, that she did not appear to notice him.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening, mother. Where's Cherry?" asked Teddy, throwing himself wearily into
                  a chair just inside the door.</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5676-00000090"/>
               <p>"An' is it yersilf, gossoon? An' it's the big hate is in it intirely."</p>
               <p>"Yes: it's hot enough. Where's Cherry?"</p>
               <p>"Takin' a little walk, honey. You wouldn't be shuttin' the poor child into the
                  house this wedder, sure?"</p>
               <p>"Taking a walk!—what, alone!" exclaimed Teddy, sitting upright very suddenly.</p>
               <p>"Of coorse not. Misther Jovarny was perlite enough to ax her; an' she wor that
                  wild to go, I couldn't say her no."</p>
               <p>"I wish you had said no, mother. I hate to let her be with that fellow, anyway.
                  I'd have taken her to walk myself, if I was twice as tired. How long have they
                  been gone?"</p>
               <p>And Teddy, in his turn, looked anxiously out at the window, but saw nothing more
                  than the squalid street weltering in the last rays of the August sun; a knot of
                  children fighting in the gutter over the body of a dead cat; an old-clothes man
                  sauntering wearily along the pavement, and a dog, with lolling tongue and
                  blood-shot eyes, following close at his heels.</p>
               <p>"How long have they been out? asked Teddy again, as he drew in his head, and
                  looked full at his mother, whose confusion struck him with a sudden dismay.</p>
               <p>"O mother!" cried he, "what is it? There's more than you're telling me amiss. How
                  long is she gone?"</p>
               <p>"Sure an' I didn't mind the clock whin they wint," said Mrs. Ginniss, still
                  struggling to avoid the shock she felt approaching.</p>
               <p>"No, no; but you can tell! O mother! do speak out, for the love of God! I can see
                  how scared you are, though you won't say it. Tell me right out all there is to
                  tell."</p>
               <p>"An' it's no great there is to till, Teddy darlint; on'y this mornin', whin I was
                  sint for to Ann Dolan (an' she that bad it's dead we thought she wor one spell,
                  but for Docther Wintworth), Jovarny kim up, an' axed might the child go for a walk
                  to the Gardens wid him; an' I jist puttin' on me shawl to go out, an' not wantin'
                  to take the little crather in wid a sick woman, nor yet to lock the door on her,
                  an' lave her to fret. So I says she might go wid him; and, whin she coom home, I
                  tould Jovarny to open the door wid the kay an' let her in, an' showed her the
                  dinner on the shelf by: an' if it's harm that's coom to her, it's harder on me
                  than on yersilf it'll fall; an' my heart is bruck, is bruck intirely."</p>
               <p>Throwing her apron over her head, Mrs. Ginniss fell into at chair, and gave way to
                  the agitation and alarm she had so<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5676-00000091"/> long
                  suppressed; but Teddy, ordinarily so kind, and tender of his mother, stared at her
                  blankly, and repeated,—</p>
               <p>"This morning! How early this morning?"</p>
               <p>"I wor jist afther washin' the bit breakfast-dishes," sobbed Mrs. Ginniss.</p>
               <p>"Twelve hours or near!" exclaimed Teddy in dismay. "And is it to the Gardens he
                  said he'd take her?"</p>
               <p>"Shure an' did he!"</p>
               <p>"To the Public Gardens, the City Gardens, just by the Commons?" persisted
                  Teddy.</p>
               <p>"Jist the Gardens wor all he said; an' towld me the shwans that wor in it, an' the
                  bit posies."</p>
               <p>"Yes: there's swans there, and posies enough," muttered Teddy, and, snatching the
                  hat he had thrown upon a chair as he entered, rushed out of the room and down the
                  stairs at headlong speed.</p>
               <p>But, before he could possibly have reached the Garden, the sun had set, all
                  visitors were excluded, and the gate-keeper had gone home. Nothing daunted, Teddy
                  scaled the high iron fence; ran rapidly through all the paths, arbors, nooks, and
                  corners of the place; and finally returned over the fence, just in time, to be
                  collared by a policeman, who had been watching him: but so sincere was the boy's
                  tone and manner, as he assured the official that he was after no harm but was
                  looking for his little sister, who had been taken away from home, and, as he
                  feared, lost, that the guardian of the public peace not only released him, but
                  inquired with some interest into the particulars of the case; saying that he had
                  been likely to notice any one remaining in the Garden longer than usual.</p>
               <p>Teddy, with anxious minuteness, described the appearance both of the lost child
                  and the "organ-fellow," as he called Giovanni; and gave the particulars of their
                  leaving home as his mother had given them to him. The policeman listened
                  attentively, but shook his head at the end.</p>
               <p>"Haven't seen any sich," said he. "Them I-talian fellers is a bad lot; and I
                  shouldn't wonder if he'd took off the child to learn her to play a tambourine, and
                  go round picking up croppers for him. You'd better wait till morning; and, if they
                  don't turn up, her mother can go and tell the chief about it."</p>
               <p>"Chief of police?" asked Teddy.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but it ain't always he can do any thing. There was that little gal, a year
                  ago pretty nigh, belonged to a man by the name of Legrange. She was lost, and they
                  offered a<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5676-00000092"/> reward of ten thousand
                  dollars finally; but she warn't never heard from. You see, there's sich a many
                  children all about: and come to change their clothes, and crop their hair, it's
                  hard to tell t'other from which," said the policeman meditatively; and then,
                  suddenly resuming his official dignity, added, "You mustn't never get over that
                  fence again, though: mind that, young man."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir," said Teddy, turning away to hide the guilty confusion of his
                  face; and, as he hurried home, he anxiously revolved the idea of applying to the
                  police for aid, should Cherry remain absent after the next morning. But Teddy knew
                  something of the law, and had too often seen better hidden secrets than his own
                  ferreted out and brought to the light by its searching finger, to wish to trust
                  himself within its grasp; at any rate, just yet.</p>
               <p>"If I find her, I'll give her up, and tell all, and never touch the reward; but
                  how can I go and say she's lost again?" thought Teddy, with a sick heart. And
                  when, running up the stairs, his quick eyes caught sight of his mother's face, his
                  own turned so ghastly white, that she ran toward him, crying,—</p>
               <p>"An' is it dead you've found her, Teddy?"</p>
               <p>"Worse; for she's lost; and all that comes to her is on my shoulders," said Teddy
                  hoarsely, as he stood just within the door, looking hungrily about the room, as if
                  he hoped, in some forgotten corner, to light upon his lost treasure.</p>
               <p>"Did Jovarny take his organ and the monkey?" asked he suddenly.</p>
               <p>"Sure, and he didn't; for I mind luckin' afther him going down the street."</p>
               <p>"Then he'll be back!" exclaimed the boy eagerly; but the next moment the new hope
                  died out of his face, and he muttered,—</p>
               <p>"He might have taken them before. Anyway, I'll soon see;" and, running down the
                  stairs, Teddy applied his sturdy shoulder and knee to the rickety door of the
                  Italian's room. Neither door nor lock was fitted to withstand much force, and,
                  with a sharp sound of rending wood and breaking iron, they flew apart; and Teddy,
                  stepping over the threshold, glanced eagerly around. The room was stripped of
                  everything except the poor furniture, which Teddy knew the Italian had hired with
                  it, and the wooden box where he had kept his clothes. Of this the key remained in
                  the lock; and, the boy, lifting the lid, soon discovered that a few worthless rags
                  were all that remained.</p>
               <p>"He's gone, and she with him!" groaned Teddy, dropping<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000093"/> ping the box-cover, and standing upright to look
                  again through the deserted room. His mother stood in the doorway.</p>
               <p>"Och, Teddy! an' it's desaved us intirely he has,—the black-hearted crather; an'
                  may the cuss O' Crom'ell stick to him day an' night, an' turn his sleep to wakin',
                  an' his mate to pizen, till all I wish him is wished out!"</p>
               <p>"It's no good cursing or wishing, mother," said Teddy bitterly. "If there was, I'd
                  curse myself the first; for it's on me it had ought to fall."</p>
               <p>"Sorra a bit of that, thin, Teddy mavourneen; for iver an' always it was yersilf
                  that wor tinder an' careful uv her that's gone; an' yersilf it wor that saved the
                  life of her, the night she first come home to us; an' it's none but good that iver
                  yees did her in all the days of yer life; an', if there's any blame to be had
                  betwixt us, it's on yer poor owld mother it should be laid,—her that loved the
                  purty darlint as if she'd been her own, an', if she's lost, will carry a brucken
                  heart to her grave wid mournin' afther her. O wurra, wurra, acushla machree! Och
                  the heavy day an' the black night that's in it! Holy Jasus, have mercy on us!
                  Spake the good word for us, blissid Vargin! Saint Bridget (that's me own
                  namesake), stip up an' intersade for us now, if iver; for black is the nade we
                  have uv help."</p>
               <p>Falling upon her knees, and pulling a rosary of wooden beads from her bosom, the
                  Irish woman pursued her petitions, mingling them with tears and exclamations more
                  or less pathetic and grotesque; while Teddy, seated upon the Italian's empty box,
                  his head between his hands, his elbows upon his knees, his eyes fixed steadily
                  upon the floor, gave up his young heart a prey to such remorse as might fitly
                  punish even a heavier crime than that of which his conscience accused him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CONFESSION.</head>
               <p>THE morning came, but brought no comfort. Mrs. Ginniss had crept up stairs, and,
                  throwing herself upon the bed, had fallen asleep with the tears still trickling
                  down her honest face; but to Teddy's haggard eyes no sleep had come, and he had
                  only changed his position by stretching himself upon the floor beside the box, his
                  head upon his arm, his aching eyeballs still shaping in the darkness the form and
                  features of the little sister whom he had sullenly resolved was lost to him
                  forever as punishment for his fault in concealing her.</p>
               <p>"If I'd brought her back," thought he again and again, "they'd have let me get
                  seeing her once in a while; they couldn't have refused me so much; and maybe some
                  day I'd have been a gentleman, and could have talked with her free and equal. But
                  now she's lost to them and to me; and, when I tell the master, he'll call me a
                  mean thief and a liar, and a rascal every way, and he'll never look at me again;
                  and mother"—</p>
               <p>Then he would wander away into dreary speculation upon what his another would say
                  when the truth was made known to her, and she found the boy on whom she had
                  lavished her love and pride dishonored and discarded by the master to whom he owed
                  so much, and whose patronage she had taken such pains to secure for him; and then,
                  like the weary burden of a never-ending song, would come again the thought,—</p>
               <p>"But if I'd brought her back at the first!"</p>
               <p>The bitter growth of the night, however, had borne fruit in a resolution firm as
                  it was painful; and, when Teddy came up stairs to make himself fit to go to the
                  office, he was able to say some words of comfort to his mother, assuring her that
                  no blame to her could come of what had happened, and that it was possible the
                  child might yet be found, as he should warn those of her loss who could use surer
                  means to search for her than any at their command.</p>
               <p>"An' is it the perlice ye're manin'?" asked Mrs. Ginniss. "Sure it's little they'd
                  heed the loss o' poor folks like us, or look for one little child that's missin',
                  whin there's more nor enough uv 'em to the fore in ivery poor man's<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000095"/> house. But niver a one like ours, Teddy b'y,—niver
                  another purty darlint like her that's gone."</p>
               <p>Teddy made no reply to this, but, hastily swallowing some food, took his hat, and
                  left the room.</p>
               <p>Upon the stairs he met the landlord, who, followed by a furniture-broker, entered
                  the room of the organ-grinder. Going in after them, Teddy learned, in answer to
                  his eager questions, that the broker had, early in the morning of the previous
                  day, received a visit from the Italian, who, announcing that he had no further use
                  for the furniture, paid what was owing for the rent of it, and made a bargain for
                  a box he was about to leave behind him; but, as to his subsequent movements, the
                  man had no information to give, nor could even judge whether he intended leaving
                  the city, or only the house.</p>
               <p>Thanking him or the information, Teddy went drearily on his way, more hopelessly
                  convinced than ever that Giovanni had deliberately stolen the child, and absconded
                  with her.</p>
               <p>"Well," muttered he, "all I've got to do now is to tell the master, and take what
                  I'll get. If he finds the little—no: she's none of that, nor ever was—if he finds
                  her, and takes her home to them that lost her, I'll be content, if it's to prison,
                  or to sweeping the streets, or to be a slave in the South, he sends me."</p>
               <p>Arrived at the office, Teddy faithfully performed his morning duties, and then
                  seated himself to wait for Mr. Barlow, who was again occupying Mr. Burroughs's
                  office during that gentleman's absence in the West. While arranging upon his table
                  some papers he was to copy, Teddy suddenly remembered that other morning, now
                  nearly a year ago, when Mr. Burroughs had laid upon his very table the picture and
                  advertisement of the lost child; and all the months of guilty hesitation and
                  concealment that since had passed seemed to roll back upon the boy's heart,
                  crushing it into the very dust. He threw down the pen he had just taken up, and
                  laid his head upon his folded arms, groaning aloud,—</p>
               <p>"Oh! if I had told him then! if I had just told him that morning!"</p>
               <p>The door of the office opened quickly; and Mr. Barlow, a grave and reserved young
                  man, who had never taken much notice of Teddy, entered, and, as he passed to the
                  inner room, glanced with some curiosity at the boy, whose emotion was not to be
                  quite concealed.</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir"—</p>
               <p>"Well, Teddy?"</p>
               <p>"I should like to send a letter to Mr. Burroughs."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean a letter from yourself?"</p>
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5676-00000096"/>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>A slight smile crossed Mr. Barlow's face, as he replied a little sneeringly,—</p>
               <p>"I am afraid your business will have to wait till Mr. Burroughs's return, my
                  boy."</p>
               <p>"Don't you be sending him letters, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I have; but, when I heard from him yesterday, he was about leaving Cincinnati,
                  and gave me no further address. He will be at home in a day or two."</p>
               <p>Mr. Barlow passed on, and Teddy stooped over his work, but to so little purpose,
                  that, on submitting it for inspection, he received a sharp reproof for his
                  negligence, and an order to do the whole afresh.</p>
               <p>"What a Quixotism of Burroughs's to try to educate this stupid fellow!" muttered
                  Mr. Barlow to a friend who lounged beside his table; and Teddy, hearing the
                  criticism upon his patron, felt an added weight fall upon his own conscience.</p>
               <p>"They laugh at him because I'm stupid, and I'm stupid because I'm thinking of what
                  I've done. It's good that they'll soon be shut of me altogether. Maybe I can sweep
                  the crossings, or clean the gutters," thought poor miserable Teddy, bending afresh
                  to his task.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs did not come so soon as expected; and Mr. Barlow became quite
                  impatient of the constant inquiry addressed to him by Teddy as to the probable
                  movements of his master. At last, about noon of Friday, he walked into the office,
                  looking more cheerful and like his old self than he had been since the heavy
                  sorrow had fallen upon the household so near to his heart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barlow greeted him heartily, and, calling him into the inner office, closed
                  the door; while Teddy remained without, his heart beating with a sick hard throb,
                  a tingling pain creeping from his brain to the ends of his icy fingers, and his
                  whole frame trembling with agitation.</p>
               <p>It was no light task that he had set himself; and so he well knew. To stand before
                  the man he loved and reverenced before all men and say to him that he had been for
                  months deliberately deceiving and injuring him and his; to confess that he had not
                  once, but persistently, refused the only chance ever offered him of repaying, in
                  some measure, the kindness and generosity of his patron; to acknowledge
                  grateful,—oh! it was no light task that the boy had set himself; and yet his
                  resolution never faltered.</p>
               <p>Great acts are only great in the light of the actor's previous history and
                  training; and perhaps the atonement<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5676-00000097"/>
                  Teddy now contemplated was for him as heroic as that of the martyred bishop who
                  held the hand that had signed the recantation steadily in the flame until it was
                  consumed.</p>
               <p>The door of the office opened, and the two gentlemen were passing out together,
                  when Teddy started up,—</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir, might I speak with you by yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! Teddy has been very anxious for an interview with you all the week. I
                  will go on, and expect you down there presently," said Mr. Barlow.</p>
               <p>"Yes, in two minutes. Come in here, Teddy, and let us hear what you have to
                  say."</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs threw himself into the chair he had just quitted, and stirred the
                  fire, saying good-humoredly,—</p>
               <p>"Out with it, my boy! What's amiss?"</p>
               <p>Teddy, standing beside the table, one clammy hand grasping the edge of it, seemed
                  to feel the floor heave beneath his feet, and the whole room to reel and swim
                  before his eyes. His tongue seemed paralyzed, his lips quivered, his voice came to
                  his own ears strange and hollow; but still he struggled on, resolute to reach the
                  worst.</p>
               <p>"It's about the little girl that was lost, sir, your little cousin
                  Antoinette."</p>
               <p>"'Toinette Legrange, cried Mr. Burroughs, his face suddenly growing earnest as he
                  turned it upon the boy, and asked,—</p>
               <p>"What is it? Have you heard of her?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. I found her in the street the night she was lost. She was dressed in
                  poor clothes, and her hair was cut off. I didn't know who she was; and I took her
                  home to my mother, and asked her to keep her for my little sister, because I never
                  got one, and always wanted her. Then she was sick; and one day you told me she was
                  lost, and showed me the picture and the piece in the paper; and I knew it was her.
                  Then I thought she was going to die, and I waited to know; and, when she got
                  better, I waited a while longer; and at last she was well, and I couldn't bear to
                  part with her"—</p>
               <p>"But she is safe now?" interrupted Mr. Burroughs, his look of stern reproach
                  mingling with a sudden hope.</p>
               <p>"No, sir: she's lost!"</p>
               <p>"What!"</p>
               <p>Teddy's white lips tried again and again before they could form the words,—</p>
               <p>"She's lost again, sir! She went out walking with Jovarny<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000098"/> varny, that's an organ-grinder, last Monday
                  morning; and he has taken her off."</p>
               <p>"You miserable fellow! You had better have killed as well as stolen her!"
                  exclaimed Mr. Burroughs.</p>
               <p>Teddy clung to the table, and reeled as if a physical blow had fallen upon him. It
                  was the first time in the four years they had spent together that his master had
                  spoken to him in anger, and now,—</p>
               <p>"Five days ago! And what have you done in that time towards looking for her?"
                  asked Mr. Burroughs sternly.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, sir. I wanted to write to you, but couldn't get any direction."</p>
               <p>"And why didn't you tell Mr. Barlow, and let him set the police at work? If you
                  had warned him as soon as you discovered the loss, this organ-grinder might have
                  been caught. Now he is perhaps in New Orleans, perhaps halfway to Europe. Why
                  didn't you tell Barlow, I say?"</p>
               <p>"Please, sir, I couldn't bear telling any one but you that I done it," said Teddy
                  in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, and, now you have told me, you will please walk out of this office,
                  and never enter it again. I did not imagine, that, in all these months, you were
                  preparing such a pleasant surprise for me. One question, however: did your mother
                  know who the child was?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir: never."</p>
               <p>"Then you may thank her that I let you off so easily; but I never desire to see
                  either of you again after to-day. Wait here for one hour, while I go with a
                  detective to hear your mother's story and to get a description of this
                  organ-grinder. At two o'clock, leave the office; and take with you whatever
                  belongs to yourself, and nothing more."</p>
               <p>Mechanically obeying his master's gesture, Teddy staggered out of the room. Mr.
                  Burroughs followed him, and, locking the door of the inner office, put the key in
                  his pocket, and went out.</p>
               <p>"He thinks I'm a thief!" was the bitter thought that darted through Teddy's mind;
                  and then, "And how could I steal more than when I stole her? He's right to lock up
                  from me."</p>

               <head type="sub">TEDDY LOSES AND FINDS HIS HOME.</head>
               <p>AN hour later, Teddy, leaving behind him the books, papers, pictures, every thing
                  that Mr. Burroughs had given him, and taking only the few articles of his clothing
                  which happened to be at the office, crept out of the door and down the stairs with
                  the look of a veritable thief.</p>
               <p>Choosing the least-frequented streets, and avoiding the recognition of such of his
                  acquaintance as chanced to meet him, he slunk homeward, feeling a little less
                  wretched, but infinitely more degraded, than he had done before his
                  confession.</p>
               <p>Burroughs knew, his mother knew, the police-officials knew,—how could he tell who
                  did not know?—of his shame and guilt. Every pair of eyes seemed to accuse him;
                  every step seemed to pursue him; every distant voice seemed to summon him to
                  receive the punishment of his misdoing; and it was as to a refuge that he at last
                  hurried in at the door and up the stairs of the tenement-house.</p>
               <p>At the upper landing, however, he paused. His mother!—oh the sorrow and the shame
                  that he had brought upon her in payment for all her love and effort, and the
                  constant sacrifices she had made, ever since he could remember, to enable him to
                  rise above his natural station, and to appear as well as his future associates! It
                  came back to him now,—not a new thought, but one intensified by the more immediate
                  suffering of the last two hours. He leaned for a moment against the wall, and
                  wiped his clammy brow, feeling that any sudden death, any strange chance that
                  could befall him, would be welcome, so that it swallowed up the coming moment, and
                  spared him the sight of the misery he had wrought.</p>
               <p>Only a moment. Then the desperate courage that had carried him through his
                  confession to his master gave him strength to open the door and enter.</p>
               <p>The ironing-table was spread, and upon a half-finished shirt lay a little pile of
                  money. Teddy knew that it was the wages owing him since the last payment, and
                  turned away his eyes with loathing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss was lying upon the bed, her face buried in the pillow, sobbing
                  heavily and wearily, as if exhausted by excessive emotion.</p>
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5676-00000100"/>
               <p>Teddy closed the door softly, and stood looking at her, uncertain whether she had
                  heard him enter. In the room below, the little child of the new tenants sung, at
                  her play, an air that Cherry had often sung.</p>
               <p>Teddy listened, and, when the little song was done, cried out,—</p>
               <p>"O mother! haven't you a word for me? I believe I'll go mad next."</p>
               <p>"Don't be spakin' to me, you bowld, bad b'y! It's niver a word I have for yees, or
                  wants from yees!" sobbed Mrs. Ginniss.</p>
               <p>Teddy looked at her drearily for a moment; then softly seated himself, his hands
                  folded listlessly in his lap, his eyes wandering idly about the familiar room, and
                  his mind journeying on and on in the weary, mechanical manner of a mind
                  over-wrought and stunned by long-continued or excessive suffering.</p>
               <p>From the street below rose the hum and bustle of city life; from the room that had
                  been Giovanni's, the voice of the child, still singing at her play. In at the open
                  window streamed the thick yellow sunshine of the August afternoon, and a great
                  droning blue fly buzzed upon the pane.</p>
               <p>Teddy noted every sound; watched the motes dancing in the sunshine, the fly
                  bouncing up and down the little window, the movements of the cat, who, rising from
                  her nap, stretched every limb separately, yawned, lazily lapped at her saucer of
                  milk, and then, seating herself in the patch of lurid sunshine, with her tail
                  curled round her fore-paws, blinked drowsily for a few minutes, and then dozed off
                  again.</p>
               <p>But, whether he listened or whether he looked, it was but ear and eye that noted
                  these familiar and homely sounds or sights. The mind still journeyed on and on in
                  that weary journey without beginning or end; that dull, heavy tramp through black
                  night, with no hope of ever reaching morning; that vain flight from a pain not for
                  one moment to be forgotten or left behind; that numb consciousness of an evil,
                  that, wait as we will, must sooner or later be met and recognized.</p>
               <p>A long hour passed, and Mrs. Ginniss suddenly arose and confronted her son.</p>
               <p>"If iver I larnt ye any thin', ye black-hearted b'y, what wor it?"</p>
               <p>Teddy raised his heavy eyes to his mother's face, but made no answer.</p>
               <p>"Worn't it to search iver an' always for the chance to do a good turn to him as
                  has done all for 'yees that yer own<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5676-00000101"/>
                  father could, an' more? Worn't that the lesson I've struv to larn ye this four
                  year back, Teddy Ginniss?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother," said the boy in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"An' haven't I towld ye, that, so as ye did it, my blessin' was wid yees, an' so
                  as ye turned yer back on it my cuss 'ud folly yees, an' the cuss uv God an' all
                  his saints and angels?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother."</p>
               <p>"An it's yersilf that's tuck heed uv me words, an' done yer best to kape 'em;
                  isn't it, me fine lad?" pursued the mother with bitter irony.</p>
               <p>"I did always, mother, till"—began Teddy humbly; but his mother angrily
                  interrupted him.</p>
               <p>"Alluz till ye got the chance to do contrairy, an' plaze yersilf at his expense.
                  Sure, an' it wor mighty perlite uv yees to wait that long, an' it's greatly
                  obleeged to yees he shud be."</p>
               <p>She waited a moment, standing before the boy, who, still seated droopingly in the
                  chair where he had first fallen, his heavy eyes looking straight before him,
                  offered neither reply nor remonstrance; while his mother, setting her hands upon
                  her hips, looked scornfully at him a moment longer, and then exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"An' have ye niver a word to say for yersilf, ye white-livered coward? Is there
                  niver anudder lie on yer tongue like thim ye found so handy this twelvemonth back?
                  Git out uv me sight, ye spalpeen, and out uv me doors! Go find them as'll kape
                  yees to stale rich folks' children, an' thin lie to the mother as bore yees, and
                  the kind masther as tried to make a gintleman out uv a thafe. Begone, I say, Teddy
                  Ginniss, and quit pizenin' the air of an honest woman's room wid yer
                  prisince!"</p>
               <p>Teddy rose, and was leaving the room without a word, but at the door turned back;
                  looked long and wistfully at his mother, who had turned away, and affected not to
                  see him; then slowly said,—</p>
               <p>"Good-by, mother! It's worse nor you can I'm feeling. Good-by! If ever I come to
                  any good, I'll let you know; and, if I don't, you're shut of me for always."</p>
               <p>The mother made no answer; and Teddy, lingering one moment on the threshold to
                  turn his sad eyes for the last time upon the familiar objects that had surrounded
                  him since childhood, went out, and down the stairs.</p>
               <p>In the street he paused a moment, looking up and down, wondering where he should
                  first go, and how food and shelter for the coming night were to be obtained. The
                     question<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5676-00000102"/> yet unsolved, he was
                  walking slowly on; when a voice far overhead called,—</p>
               <p>"Teddy!—Teddy Ginniss! Come here, I say!"</p>
               <p>It was his mother's voice; and, as he looked up, it was his mother's face and hand
                  summoning him.</p>
               <p>In the same forlorn, stunned way that he had come down, Teddy climbed the stairs
                  again, feeling as if his feet were shod with lead, or the terrible weight at his
                  heart was too heavy to be carried a step farther.</p>
               <p>He pushed open the door of his mother's room, but never looked up or spoke,
                  although he knew she stood close behind it. But, indeed, there could have been no
                  time, had the boy wished to speak; for already his mother's arms were around his
                  neck, and her head upon his stout shoulder, while the passionate tears fell like
                  rain upon his hands.</p>
               <p>"Ochone, ochone! An' it's me own an' only b'y yees are, an' must be, Teddy
                  darlint; an' it's mesilf that 'ud be worse nor a haythin to turn yees inter the
                  strate, so long as it's a roof an' a bit I have left for yees. An' sure, if ye've
                  gone astray, it's the heart uv yees that's bruck wid frettin' afther it; an'
                  there's a many as has done wuss, and niver a hape it harmed 'em here nor
                  hereafter. An', if Michael wor here the day, it's himself 'ud say to pass it by;
                  an' it wor little I should be plazin' his blissid sowl to turn yees off for one
                  fault. Kiss yer owld mother, honey, an' be her own b'y again!"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, mother," said Teddy, still in the strange, low voice he had used
                  before; and, putting his arms round her neck, he met and returned her hearty kiss,
                  and then, without another word, went and shut himself into the little loft he
                  called his own, and was seen no more that night.</p>

               <head type="sub">MR. BURROUGHS'S BUSINESS.</head>
               <p>It was the afternoon of Thursday, Aug. 25: and Dora, sitting beside the bed where
                  her little charge lay sleeping heavily, heard the rattle of wheels, and, peeping
                  from the window, saw Karl jumping from the wagon, followed more slowly by a tall,
                  handsome young gentleman, whom she concluded to be Mr. Burroughs; her cousin
                  having gone to meet him at the railway-station, seven miles away.</p>
               <p>"He's good-looking enough for a colonel," thought Dora, and then started back,
                  coloring a little; for Mr. Burroughs, in entering the house, had glanced up, and
                  caught her eye. The next minute, Kitty darted into the room from her own
                  chamber.</p>
               <p>"They've come! Did you see him? Isn't he a real beauty? I do love a tall man!—He's
                  as tall as Mr. Brown, and his whiskers are ever so much prettier; but, then, Mr.
                  Brown's a minister. My! How nice you look, Dora! Go right down, and I'll stay with
                  little Molly."</p>
               <p>Dora glanced involuntarily at the mirror, and caught the reflection of a bright
                  face, surrounded by heavy chestnut curls, and lighted with clear hazel eyes, and
                  flashing teeth, a head of queenly shape and poise, and a firm, graceful figure,
                  well set off by its white dress, black bodice, and scarlet ribbons,—a charming
                  picture, with the quaintly decorated chamber for background, and the heavy black
                  frame of the old mirror for setting: and a brighter color washed into the young
                  girl's cheek as she recognized the fact; but she only said,—</p>
               <p>"Why do you call her Molly, Kitty?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! just a fancy name. We must call her something, and can't find out her right
                  name."</p>
               <p>"She called it Sunshine," said Dora, bending to kiss the pale little face upon the
                  pillow as she passed.</p>
               <p>"Moonshine, more like," replied Kitty. "She didn't mean it for a name, of course.
                  You didn't understand. But come: your beau is waiting."</p>
               <p>"Don't, Kitty, please!"</p>
               <p>"I might as well begin. Every man is a beau that comes near you. I never saw such
                  luck!"</p>
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5676-00000104"/>
               <p>Dora opened her lips, closed them tightly, and left the room. The next moment she
                  stood in the low doorway of the parlor, bowing gravely, but not shyly, to the
                  stately gentleman, whose head grazed the great white beam in the ceiling as he
                  came forward to meet her.</p>
               <p>"Miss Darling, I presume," said he.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; I am Dora Darling: and you are Mr. Burroughs; are you not?"</p>
               <p>"At your service," said the gentleman, bowing again; and, handing Dora a chair, he
                  took another for himself.</p>
               <p>"Won't you have some water, or a glass of milk, after your drive, Mr. Burroughs?"
                  asked Dora with anxious hospitality; and, as the gentleman confessed to an
                  inclination for some water, she tripped away, and presently returned with a
                  tumbler, which Mr. Burroughs very willingly took from her slender fingers instead
                  of a salver.</p>
               <p>"You know I was a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vivandière</foreign>, sir," said Dora,
                  smiling frankly; "and I always think of people being thirsty and tired when they
                  come in so."</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs smiled, too, as he handed back the empty glass.</p>
               <p>"I wish we had all turned our army experiences to as good account," said he.</p>
               <p>"Were you in the army?" asked Dora with sudden animation.</p>
               <p>"Yes: I was lieutenant in the Massachusetts Sixth, and went through Baltimore with
                  them," said Burroughs, tightening himself a little as the associations of military
                  drill came back upon him.</p>
               <p>"Oh! were you there? Wasn't it glorious to be the very first?" exclaimed Dora;
                  and, with no further preamble, the two plunged into a series of army reminiscences
                  and gossip, that kept them busy until Karl entered the room, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Well, Dora, what do you think of Mr. Burroughs's news?"</p>
               <p>"She has not heard it yet," said Mr. Burroughs, laughing a little. "We have been
                  so busy talking over our army experiences, that we have not come to business."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you have not; for I want to see how Dora will take it: but you will be
                  grieved, as well as pleased, little girl."</p>
               <p>"Yes," pursued Mr. Burroughs. "I am sorry to inform Miss Dora, that your friend
                  Col. Blank is dead."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Col. Blank dead!" exclaimed Dora, while a sudden shadow fell upon her bright
                  face.</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5676-00000105"/>
               <p>"I am very, very sorry," continued she. "Mr. Brown went to see him two months ago,
                  and he was quite well then."</p>
               <p>"Yes: this was rather a sudden illness; a fever, I believe. They tell me, that,
                  since his wife died, he has never been very well, and at last was only ill three
                  weeks."</p>
               <p>"I am so sorry!" said Dora again. "He was very kind to me always."</p>
               <p>"And no doubt died with feelings of affection and confidence for you, Miss, Dora;
                  since he has made you his heir."</p>
               <p>"Me!" exclaimed the young girl in a tone more of fright than of pleasure.</p>
               <p>"Yes; and, although the property is not of any great available value at present, I
                  think, if properly managed, it may, in the future, become something very
                  handsome," said the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"But I am so sorry Col. Blank is dead! Why, on Cheat Mountain, he seemed so strong
                  and well! He was never tired on the marches, and hardly ever rode, but walked at
                  the head of the column so straight and soldierly!"</p>
               <p>The two men glanced at each other, then at her, and gravely smiled. The regret was
                  so unaffected, so unselfish, and so unworldly, that each, after his own fashion,
                  admired and marvelled at it. Mr. Burroughs was the first to speak; and, drawing a
                  packet of papers from his pocket, he spread before Dora's sorrowful eyes a copy of
                  Col. Blank's will, a plan of the estate bequeathed by it to her, and an official
                  letter from Mr. Ferrars, the principal executor. This Mr. Ferrars, the lawyer
                  informed his young client, was a personal friend of his own, and had placed the
                  matter in his hands, thinking that the news might be more satisfactorily arranged
                  by an interview than by correspondence.</p>
               <p>"And, as I was coming East at the time, I could very conveniently call to see you
                  on my way home," concluded Mr. Burroughs.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir," said Dora meekly; and then, rather sadly, but very patiently,
                  listened while the lawyer described the property she had inherited, and indicated
                  the best course to pursue with regard to it.</p>
               <p>"You will perceive, Miss Dora, that the bulk of the estate consists of this large
                  tract of territory in Iowa, containing a great deal of valuable timber, a hundred
                  or so common-sized farms of superb soil, and prairie-land enough to graze all the
                  herds of the West.</p>
               <p>"Col. Blank had just invested all his property, except the<pb n="210-211"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000106"/> estate in Cincinnati, in the purchase of this
                  tract, and was about to remove thither, when Mrs. Blank died; and, as I said, he
                  never seemed quite himself after that event, and took no further steps toward
                  emigration. The house in Cincinnati might sell, Mr. Ferrars thought, for three or
                  four thousand dollars; enough, you see, to make a beginning at 'Outpost,' as the
                  colonel called it."</p>
               <p>"Did he name the Iowa farm Outpost?" asked Dora rather eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Yes: you see the name is written on this map of the estate."</p>
               <p>"Then we will call it so; won't we, Karl?"</p>
               <p>"But you don't advise my cousin to emigrate to the backwoods, do you, Mr.
                  Burroughs?" asked Karl disapprovingly.</p>
               <p>"It is the only method of reaping any immediate benefit from her inheritance,"
                  said the lawyer. "The territory is valuable, very; but would not sell to-day for
                  anything like the price paid by Col. Blank, who fancied its situation, and
                  intended to live there. The only way to get back the money is to hold the land
                  until better times, or until emigration reaches the Des Moines more freely than it
                  has yet done."</p>
               <p>"I shall certainly go there and live," said Dora with quiet positiveness.</p>
               <p>"You have decided?" asked Mr. Burroughs, looking into her face, and smiling.</p>
               <p>"Quite," said Dora.</p>
               <p>Karl looked too, saw the firm line of the young girl's rosy lips, and slightly
                  raised his eyebrows.</p>
               <p>"It is settled," said he with comic resignation.</p>
               <p>Dora returned his gaze wistfully. She could not, in presence of a stranger, say
                  what was in her heart: but she longed to let him know that this prospect of
                  independence, of making a home of her own, of assuming duties and pursuits of her
                  own, was such a prospect as no friend could wish her to forego; was the full and
                  only cure for the bitterness of heart she had been unable to conceal from him upon
                  the previous evening,—a bitterness so foreign to the sweet and noble nature of the
                  young girl, that it had affected her cousin's mind with a sort of terror.</p>
               <p>Something of all she meant must have stood visibly in the clear eyes Dora now
                  fixed upon Karl; for, in meeting that gaze, the young man changed color, and said
                  hastily,—</p>
               <p>"But if you will be happier, Dora; if you are not contented here—It is a humdrum
                  sort of life, I know."</p>
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5676-00000107"/>
               <p>"Oh, no! not that; but I want to be doing something. I mean something almost more
                  than I can do, not ever so much less. I like to feel as if I must use every bit of
                  strength and courage I have, and then I always find more than I thought I
                  had."</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs looked sharply at the young girl who made this ungirlish avowal. Was
                  this utter simplicity? or was it an ingenious affectation? Was Dora Darling one of
                  the noblest, or one of the most crafty, of womankind?</p>
               <p>Tom Burroughs was a man of the world and of society, and flattered himself that
                  neither man nor woman had art deeper than his penetration; but as he rapidly
                  scanned the broad brow, clear, level-glancing eyes, firm, sweet mouth, queenly
                  head, and mien of innocent self-confidence, he asked himself again,—</p>
               <p>"Is it the perfection of art, or can it be the perfection of nature?"</p>
               <p>But Karl was saying rather gloomily,—</p>
               <p>"And what is to become of us, Dora?"</p>
               <p>"Kitty and you?" asked Dora, open-eyed. "Why, of course, you are to come too! Did
                  you suppose I wanted to leave you? Of course, it is your home and mine, just as
                  this house has been: we are all one family, you know."</p>
               <p>"To be sure. Well, I fancy there will be something for me to do on your Outpost
                  farm. You must make me overseer."</p>
               <p>"No: you shall be confidential adviser; but I am going to oversee every thing
                  myself, and you must go on with your medical studies."</p>
               <p>"You are going to become practical farmer, then?" asked Mr. Burroughs, raising his
                  eyebrows never so slightly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; not to really work with my own hands out of doors, you know, but to see
                  to every thing. At first, I shan't understand much about it, I suppose; but I
                  shall learn, and I shall be so happy!"</p>
               <p>"And how soon will you be ready to go?" asked Mr. Burroughs.</p>
               <p>Dora considered for a moment, "To-day is Thursday. I think we might start Monday
                  morning; couldn't we, Karl?"</p>
               <p>"And meantime sell this place and furniture?" asked Mr. Windsor, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Not sell, but let the place. There is Jacob Minot would be glad to hire it, and a
                  good tenant too. As for the furniture, we had better carry it with us. Shall we<pb
                     n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5676-00000108"/> have to build a house when we get
                  there, Mr. Burroughs?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Col. Blank had selected a site, and made some little beginning: I believe
                  nothing more than having the land cleared and a cellar dug, however. You will
                  begin with a log-cabin; shall you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes: I suppose so. Well, Karl, mightn't we start on Monday?"</p>
               <p>"Not in heavy marching order, I am afraid; but very soon, if you are quite
                  determined."</p>
               <p>"Yes, quite; but what will Kitty think?" asked Dora suddenly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I think she will like it. Here she comes, and we can ask her."</p>
               <p>The crisp rustle of muslin skirts swept down the stairs; and Mr. Burroughs,
                  turning his head, saw standing in the doorway a tall, handsome brunette, with
                  masses of black hair rolled away from a low forehead, glancing black eyes, and
                  ripe lips, showing just now the sparkle of white teeth between, as the young lady
                  half waited for an introduction before entering.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Burroughs, Kitty; my sister, sir," said Karl, rising, and handing a chair to
                  Kitty, who, with rather too wide a sweep of her bright muslin skirts, seated
                  herself, and said, half laughing,—</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are through with your secrets by this time?"</p>
               <p>"We were just wanting to tell you the new plan, and see how you will like it,"
                  said Dora quickly; for she felt an involuntary dread lest Kitty should, in
                  presence of this courteous stranger, say something to do herself discredit.</p>

               <head type="sub">MAN VERSUS DOG.</head>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs staid to tea, and, while it was being prepared, strolled with Karl
                  about the little farm; looked at the Alderney cow, the Suffolk pigs, the span of
                  Morgan horses named Pope and Pagan; quietly sounded the depths of Capt. Karl's
                  open and joyous nature, and made him talk of his cousin Dora, and reveal his love
                  and his hopes regarding her.</p>
               <p>"They will marry out there, and she will manage him, and make him very happy,"
                  thought Mr. Burroughs, returning toward the farmhouse, and admiring the long slope
                  of the mossy roof, and the clinging masses of woodbine creeping to the
                  ridge-pole.</p>
               <p>"You won't make so picturesque a thing of your new home for several years to come,
                  if ever, Mr. Windsor," added he aloud.</p>
               <p>"No, I suppose not; but the genius of our people is more for beginning than
                  ending, and this old place was built by my grandfather," said the young man.</p>
               <p>"An excellent and most American reason for deserting it," said Mr. Burroughs
                  gravely; "and, if you are thinking of selling, I should like the opportunity of
                  becoming purchaser. This sort of thing is going out of the market, and I should
                  like to secure a specimen before it is too late. It is same as a picture, except
                  that it is stationary, and one must come to it instead of carrying it away in
                  triumph."</p>
               <p>"I think we may like to sell; but I must consult my sister and cousin first," said
                  Karl rather gravely: for, after all, he did not just like the tone assumed by this
                  fine city gentleman in speaking of the place that had been a home to Karl and his
                  ancestors for more than a century. The quick tact of the lawyer perceived the
                  slight wound he had given, and repaired it by carelessly saying,—</p>
               <p>"And, besides the beauty of the place, I should be proud possessing any thing that
                  had belonged to a grandfather. My family has been so migratory, that I can hardly
                  say I had a grandfather or not: certainly I have not the remotest idea where he
                  lived."</p>
               <p>Capt. Karl laughed.</p>
               <p>"Our family has been settled here since the days of the<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000110"/> Pilgrims" said he; "and Kitty could show you a
                  family chart, as large as a table-cloth, of which she is mightily proud, although
                  I never could see any particular benefit it has been to us."</p>
               <p>"And Miss Dora—is she fond of recalling her ancestors and their fame? or is she
                  satisfied with her own?" asked Mr. Burroughs.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe it ever occurred to her that either she or they deserved any,"
                  said Karl, laughing. "You never knew a creature so entirely simple and
                  self-forgetful in your life, and yet of so wide and noble a nature. She is never
                  so happy as in doing good to other people."</p>
               <p>"But likes to do it in her own way?" suggested the lawyer pleasantly.</p>
               <p>"Likes to do it in the best way, and her own way is sure to be that," replied Karl
                  somewhat decidedly; and Mr. Burroughs smiled and bowed.</p>
               <p>In the, doorway, under the swinging branch of the tall sweetbrier, suddenly
                  appeared Kitty, her brown face becoming flushed, and the buttons of her
                  under-sleeves not yet adjusted.</p>
               <p>"Tea is ready; will you please to walk in, Mr. Burroughs?" said she: and the guest
                  followed, well pleased, to the wide, cool kitchen, with its white, scoured floor,
                  its vine-shaded windows and open door giving a view of broad meadow-lands, with a
                  brook curling crisply through them, and a dark pine-wood beyond. In the centre
                  stood the neat tea-table, with its country dainties of rich cream, yellow butter,
                  custards, ripe peaches sliced and served with sugar, buttermilk-biscuit, and the
                  fresh sponge-cake, on which Kitty justly prided herself.</p>
               <p>"You see we are plain country-folks, and eat in the kitchen, Mr. Burroughs," said
                  she, with a little laugh, as they seated themselves.</p>
               <p>"Is this room called a kitchen? You amuse yourself by jesting with my ignorance,"
                  said Mr. Burroughs, looking about him with affected simplicity. "If ever I should
                  live here, I would call this the refreshing-room; for I can imagine nothing more
                  soothing to eyes weary of a summer sun than these vine-covered windows, and the
                  cool greens of that meadow and the pine-forest beyond."</p>
               <p>Kitty smiled a little vaguely, half inclined to insist upon the kitchen-side of
                  the question; when Karl asked, in a disappointed tone,—</p>
               <p>"Where is Dora? Isn't she coming?"</p>
               <p>"Not yet. Molly waked up, and Dora is giving her some<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000111"/> supper. She said she would come as soon as she had
                  done. You didn't know, Mr. Burroughs, that Dora has an adopted child, did
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed. She is young to undertake such responsibility," said Mr. Burroughs a
                  little curiously.</p>
               <p>"This is a little foreigner too, that Dora picked up in the road. No one knows who
                  she may be, or what dreadful people may come after her any day. Dora is so
                  queer!"</p>
               <p>"Will you have a biscuit, Kitty? Mr. Burroughs, let me give you some of this
                  peach? We shall be sorry to leave our peach-orchard behind in going to the West. I
                  suppose, however, one can soon be started there."</p>
               <p>And Karl, determined not to allow Kitty the chance of making any of her spiteful
                  little speeches about Dora in presence of the visitor, kept the conversation upon
                  purely impersonal topics, until they rose from table, and the two gentlemen
                  strolled out upon the porch at the western door; while Kitty ran up to call Dora,
                  whom she found sitting beside the bed, with Sunshine's head lying upon her
                  arm.</p>
               <p>"Isn't she asleep?" whispered Kitty.</p>
               <p>The child half opened her eyes, and murmured drowsily,—</p>
               <p>"I want to ride on the elephant. It's my little wife."</p>
               <p>"What did she say, Dora?"</p>
               <p>"Hush! She is out of her head, I think. She has been saying I was her little
                  wife," whispered Dora.</p>
               <p>"Well, that's English, anyway," replied Kitty, staring at the child. "What do you
                  suppose she is?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know. There, pet, there! Hus—h!" As she spoke, Dora carefully withdrew
                  her arm from under the little head, where, in the August night, the hair clung in
                  moist golden spirals, and a soft dew stood upon the white forehead.</p>
               <p>"I'll stay and fan her for a while longer, she looks so warm," whispered Dora.</p>
               <p>"No, no! come down and eat your supper, and help clear away. Charley asked Mr.
                  Burroughs to stay all night, and I guess he will. Isn't he real splendid? Come
                  down, and talk about him."</p>
               <p>Sunshine slept soundly; and Dora, half reluctantly, suffered herself to be led
                  away by her cousin, closing the door softly behind her, and leaving the little
                  child to dreams of a home so far away, and yet so near; of a vanished past, that,
                  even in this moment, stretched a detaining hand from out the darkness, groping for
                  her own; of human love immortal as heaven, and yet, for the moment, less
                  trustworthy than the instinct of the brutes: for if Mr. Thomas<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000112"/> Burroughs, instead of being a highly cultivated and
                  intellectual man, had been a dog of only average intelligence, 'Toinette Legrange
                  would already have been discovered and, before another sunset, the slow agony
                  devouring her mother's heart would have been relieved.</p>
               <p>But to each of us our gifts; and Mr. Burroughs, never suspecting how deficient
                  were his own, strolled with his host beneath the trees, until the appearance of
                  the young ladies upon the porch; when he joined them, and resumed his conversation
                  with Dora. From army matters, the talk soon wandered to the new prospects of Col.
                  Blank's heiress; and Mr. Burroughs found himself first amused, then animated and
                  interested, quite beyond his wont, in the young girl's plans and expectations.</p>
               <p>It was late when the party separated; and as the guest closed the door of the
                  rosy-room, and cast an admiring glance over its neat appointments, he muttered to
                  himself,—</p>
               <p>"What a bright, fresh little room! and what a brighter, fresher little girl!—as
                  different from thy city friends, Tom Burroughs, as the cream she pours is from the
                  chalky composition of the hotels. Thou dost half persuade me to turn Hoosier, and
                  help thee convert the wilderness to a blooming garden, O darlingest of
                  Darlings!"</p>
               <p>And as the young man, with a half-smile upon his lips, set sail for the vague and
                  beautiful shores of Dreamland, a bright, sweet face lighted by two earnest eyes,
                  seemed to herald him the way, and join itself to all his fairest fancies.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">MRS. GINNISS HAS A VISITOR.</head>
               <p>HEAVILY went the days in the lowly home of Mrs. Ginniss and her son. Teddy sought
                  early and late for employment, disdaining nothing, however humble, whereby he
                  might earn a few cents, and working as diligently at street-sweeping,
                  dust-gathering, errand-running, or horse-holding, as he had ever done in the way
                  of gaining an education under the kind tuition of his late master.</p>
               <p>Every night he brought home some small sum, and silently placed it in his mother's
                  hand; nor, though she urged it, would he retain a penny for himself, or indulge in
                  any of the small luxuries he had in former days enjoyed so much.</p>
               <p>"Go buy a wather-million, honey, or get an ice-crame; sure it's nothin' at all
                  ye're atin'," the fond mother would say: but Teddy always shook his head, or, if
                  the matter were urged, took his cap and went out, always with the weary step that
                  had become habitual to him, and returned no more until bedtime.</p>
               <p>"It's frettin' himsilf to his grave the crather is," said poor Mrs. Ginniss, and
                  tried in many a motherly way to make home pleasant to her boy, and to re-awaken
                  the ambition that seemed quite dead in his heart. No more reading aloud now, of
                  which he had been so fond; no more recitals of interesting or humorous scenes in
                  office or street; no more wise opinions upon public events: all the boy's boyish
                  conceit and self-esteem, germs in a strong character of worthy self-respect,
                  seemed crushed out of him. Patient, humble, silent, one could hardly recognize in
                  this Teddy Ginniss that other Teddy, whose cheery voice, frequent laugh, positive
                  opinions and wishes, and good-humored self-satisfaction, had been the leading
                  features of his modest home.</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Ginniss longed to be contradicted or instructed or laughed at once more,
                  and fought against her son's submissive respect as another mother might have done
                  against disobedience or insolence.</p>
               <p>"Can't ye be mad nor yet be merry at nothin', Teddy?" asked she impatiently one
                  day.</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5676-00000114"/>
               <p>"I'm thinking I'll never be merry again, mother," said Teddy sadly, as he left the
                  room.</p>
               <p>It was in the afternoon of the same day, that Mrs. Ginniss, sitting at her sewing
                  in melancholy mood enough, heard a little tap at her door, and, opening it, found
                  upon the threshold a lady, elegant in her simple dress of gray, who asked,—</p>
               <p>"Are you Mrs. Ginniss?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am; I'm that same," said the laundress, staring strangely at the lovely
                  face framed in a shower of feathery golden ringlets, and lighted by large violet
                  eyes as sad as they were sweet.</p>
               <p>"Will ye be plazed to walk in, ma'am?" continued she. "It's but a poor place for
                  the likes uv yees."</p>
               <p>The lady made no reply, but, gliding into the room, stood for a moment looking
                  about it, and then turning to the Irish woman, who still regarded her in the same
                  awestruck manner, said piteously,—</p>
               <p>"I am her mother!"</p>
               <p>"Sure an' I knowed it the minute I sot eyes on ye; for it's the same swate face,
                  an' eyes that's worse nor cryin, ye've got; an' the same way of a born lady, so
                  quite an' so grand. Och! it wor a purty darlint, it wor; an' it's me own heart
                  that's sore for her the day, forbye your'n that's her borned mother; and, if it
                  wor my own life that 'ud fetch her back to yees"—</p>
               <p>But here the long breath on which Mrs. Ginniss had started came to an end, and
                  with it the impulse of consolation and self-defence that had so far sustained her;
                  and with a wild cry of "Wurra, wurra! och the black day that's in it!" she sank
                  upon a chair, and buried her head in her apron, sobbing loudly.</p>
               <p>The visitor, hardly regarding her, still stood in the centre of the little room,
                  her sad eyes wandering over its humble furniture and adornments as if each one
                  were a relic.</p>
               <p>"Are there some little things of hers, clothes or playthings or books,—any thing
                  she touched or loved?" asked she presently in a hushed voice.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ginniss, still crying, rose, and opened a drawer in the pine bureau, which,
                  with a looking-glass and some vases of blue china upon it, stood as the ornamental
                  piece of furniture of the place.</p>
               <p>"Here they bees, ivery one uv 'em, and poor enough for her, an' yit the bist we
                  could git," said she.</p>
               <p>More as a bird, long restrained and suddenly set free, would dart toward the tree
                  where nest and young awaited it,<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5676-00000115"/> than
                  in the ordinary mode of human movement, the mother, so long hungering for smallest
                  tidings of her child, darted upon this sudden mine of wealth, and, bending low,
                  seemed to caress each object with her eyes before touching it. Then tearing off
                  her gloves, she laid her white fingers softly upon the coarse garments, the broken
                  toys, the few worn books, and bits of paper covered with pencil-marks, the strip
                  of gay patchwork with the needle still sticking in it, and the little brass
                  thimble upon it.</p>
               <p>At one end of the drawer stood a little pair of slippers, with some slightly
                  soiled white stockings rolled up and laid within them. At sight of these, a low
                  cry—it might have been of pain, it might have been of joy—crept from between the
                  pale lips of the mother; and, reverently lifting the little shoes, she kissed them
                  again and again, in an eager, longing fashion, as one might kiss the lips of a
                  dying child whom human love may yet recall to human life.</p>
               <p>"Thim's the little shlippers that Teddy saved his bit uv spinding-money till he
                  could buy for her, bekase he said the fut uv her wor too purty to put in sich
                  sthrong shoe's as I'd got; and thin it was mesilf that saved the white little
                  shtockings out uv me tay an' sugar; an' it's like a little fairy (save me for
                  spakin' the word) that she lucked in 'em."</p>
               <p>Pressing the little shoes close to her bosom with both hands, the mother turned
                  those mournful eyes upon the speaker, listening to every word, and, at the end,
                  said eagerly,—</p>
               <p>"Tell me some more! Tell me every thing she said and did! Oh! was she happy?"</p>
               <p>The word had grown so strange upon her lips and in her heart, that, as she said
                  it, all the tense chords, so long attuned to grief, thrilled with a sharp discord;
                  and, turning yet paler than before, she sank upon a chair, and, leaning her
                  forehead on the edge of the open drawer, wept such tears as, pray God, happy
                  mothers, you and I may never weep.</p>
               <p>"O my baby, my baby! O my little child!" moaned she again and again, until the
                  tender heart of the Irish woman could endure no longer; and, coming to the side of
                  her guest, she knelt beside her, and put her arms about the slender figure that
                  shook with every sob, and drew the bright head to rest upon her own shoulder.</p>
               <p>"O ye poor darlint! ye poor, young crather, that's got the black sorrer atin'
                  inter yer heart, all the same as if ye wor owld an' mane an' oogly, like
                  mesilf!—it's none but Him aboov as kin comfort yees. Blissid Vargin, as was a
                  moother yersilf, an' knowed a moother's pains an' a moother's love, an' all the

                  down on this young moother an' help her, an' spake to thim as can help her betther
                  nor yees, an' give back her child; bekase ye mind the time yer own Howly Child wor
                  lost, an' ye sought him sorrerin'; an' ye mind the joy an' the comfort that wor in
                  it whin he was foun'. Och Mother of Jasus! hear us this day, if niver again."</p>
               <p>As the passionate prayer ended, the lady raised her head, and kissed the
                  tear-stained cheek of the petitioner.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said she. "I know that you were good to her, and that she loved you;
                  but, oh! did she forget me so soon?"</p>
               <p>Alas poor human heart whose purest impulses are tinged with selfishness! You who
                  have lost your nearest and dearest, can you say from your inmost soul that you
                  would be content to know yourself and all of earth forgotten, or that it is sorrow
                  to you to fancy that a lingering memory, a faint regret for the love you so
                  lavished, stains the perfection of heavenly bliss?</p>
               <p>Tact is not a matter of breeding; and Chesterfield or Machiavelli could have found
                  no better answer than that of Mrs. Ginniss:—</p>
               <p>"Sure, honey, it wor alluz she remembered yees, an' longed for yees; though the
                  little crather wor that yoong, an' the faver had so poot her about, that she didn'
                  know what it wor she wanted nor missed; but it wor 'mother' as wor writ in the
                  blue eyes uv her as plain as prentin'."</p>
               <p>"And was she very, very sick?" asked the sad voice again.</p>
               <p>"The sickest crather that iver coom back from hivin's gate," replied the other;
                  and then, seating herself beside her visitor, she began at the beginning, and gave
                  a long detail of the circumstances attending Cherry's first appearance in the
                  garret, and her subsequent illness and convalescence. Then came the story of her
                  acquaintance with Giovanni; her passion for dancing and singing with him; and
                  finally their flight, and the consternation and sorrow of her adopted mother.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange listened to every thing with the most profound attention, asking now
                  and then a question, or uttering an exclamation; even smiling faintly at mention
                  of the child's graceful dancing and sweet voice in singing.</p>
               <p>"Yes, she had an extraordinary ear for music," murmured she; "and to think of her
                  remembering being called Cerito!"</p>
               <p>Nor did the mother fail to notice how the whole coarse fabric of the Irish woman's
                  story was embroidered with a golden thread of love and admiration, and even
                     reverence,<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5676-00000117"/> for the exquisite little
                  creature she had cherished and cared for so tenderly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you loved her; and I love you for it, and will always be your friend. But
                  Teddy?" asked she at last; for Mrs. Ginniss, through the whole story, had
                  carefully avoided all mention of her son, except in the most casual and general
                  fashion. Now, however, she boldly answered,—</p>
               <p>"An' its mesilf loved the purty crather well; but my love kim no nearer the love
                  the b'y had for her than the light of a taller candle does to the sun in hiven. He
                  loved her that sthrong, that it med him do a mane thing in kapin' her whin he
                  knowed who she wor; but sure it's betther ter sin fer love than ter sin fer sin's
                  sake."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange smiled sadly. To her it had seemed, from the first, small matter of
                  surprise, however great of regret, that Teddy should have found 'Toinette's
                  attractions irresistible; or that, having once appropriated her as his little
                  sister, he should have found it almost impossible to relinquish her.</p>
               <p>She had not, therefore, shared at all in the indignation of her cousin and husband
                  toward the boy, and had even solicited the former to retain him in his employ. But
                  Mr. Burroughs, kind, generous, and forbearing as he was, cherished ished
                  implacable ideas of integrity and honor, and never forgave an offence against
                  either, whether in friend or servant; so that his cousin had finally withdrawn her
                  request, asking, instead, that he should conduct her to Mrs. Ginniss's dwelling,
                  and leave the rest to her. This the young man had consented to do; and, as Mrs.
                  Legrange would not allow him to wait for her, he had privately instructed James to
                  do so, and had not left the outer door until he saw that faithful servitor upon
                  guard.</p>
               <p>Just what were her own intentions with regard to Teddy, or his mother, Mrs.
                  Legrange did not herself know; and, once arrived in the room where 'Toinette had
                  lived out the weary months since her loss, all other ideas had faded and
                  disappeared before the memories there confronting her. Now, however, the sweet and
                  generous nature of the woman re-asserted itself, and she kindly said,—</p>
               <p>"Yes: I see how great Teddy's temptation was, and I cannot wonder that he yielded
                  to it. Any one would have found it hard to part with 'Toinette; and he, poor boy!
                  could not know how I was suffering. It would have been different if you had known
                  who she was."</p>
               <p>"Indade an' it would. One moother can fale fer another; but these childhren hasn't
                  the sinse till they gits the<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5676-00000118"/> sorrer.
                  Small fear that Teddy'll iver go asthray agin from light-heartedness."</p>
               <p>"Does he feel very sorry, then?" asked Mrs. Legrange timidly.</p>
               <p>"Sorry isn't the word, ma'am. It's his own heart as he consumes day an' night,"
                  said Mrs. Ginniss gloomily.</p>
               <p>"Because she is lost, or because he kept her in the first place?" asked the

               <p>"It's hard tellin', an' he niver spakin' whin he can help it; but I belave it's
                  all together. He wor sich a bowld b'y, an' so sthrong for risin' in the world; an'
                  wor alluz sayin' as he'd be a gintleman afore he died, an' readin' his bit books
                  and writins, an' tillin' me about the way the counthry wor goin'; an', right or

               <head type="sub">TEDDY FINDS A NEW PATRON.</head>
               <p>TEDDY, dragging his heavy feet up the stairs in the stifling September twilight,
                  paused suddenly to listen to a murmur of voices in his mother's room.</p>
               <p>Some one was speaking; and the pure, clear tone sent a thrill through his veins
                  like the shock of an electric battery. No voice but one had ever sounded like that
                  to him; and, springing up the remaining stairs, Teddy threw open the door of the
                  chamber, and looked eagerly about it.</p>
               <p>The one for whom he looked was not there; but, instead, a lady, whose fragile
                  loveliness reminded him so strangely of the little sister as she had looked in her
                  long days of convalescence, that he stood still, staring dumbly.</p>
               <p>"An' where's yer manners, Teddy Ginniss? Couldn' ye see the lady forenenst ye,
                  widout starin' like a stuck pig?—It's dazed he is, ma'am, wid seein' the likes uv
                  yees in this poor place."</p>
               <p>"Come here, Teddy; I am waiting to see you," said the lady. And again the pure,
                  silvery tones tingled along Teddy's nerves with a sharp, sweet thrill.</p>
               <p>"O ma'am! are you her mother?" cried he breathlessly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am her mother, and have come to see you, who loved her so well, and your
                  good mother, who cared for her when she was motherless"—</p>
               <p>The sweet voice faltered, and Teddy broke in,—</p>
               <p>"And you needn't be afraid to say the worst that can be said, ma'am. I've said it
                  all before; and you can't hate me worse than I hate myself."</p>
               <p>"Hate you, my poor boy? I only pity you; for I have heard, and can see, how much
                  you suffer. I cannot wonder that you should love her so well; and, when you knew
                  who she was, I dare say you were meaning to restore her, so soon as you could
                  bring yourself to it."</p>
               <p>"Indeed I was, ma'am. I can take God to witness that I was," said Teddy solemnly,
                  his eyes brimming, and his face working with the strong emotion he tried so hard
                  to subdue.</p>
               <p>"I am sure of it; and I love you more for the love you bore her than I blame you
                  for the fault that love led you<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5676-00000120"/> into."
                  She paused a moment; and then the insatiate mother pride and love burst out,
                  demanding sympathy.</p>
               <p>"She <emph>was</emph> a lovely child, wasn't she, Teddy?" asked she with a
                  tremulous smile.</p>
               <p>The boy's rough face lighted, as if by reflection from her own, as he
                  replied,—</p>
               <p>"O ma'am! it's so good of you to let me talk about her! There was never another
                  like her in all the world, I believe. I used to take her walking Sundays, and look
                  at all the children we met (some of them rich folks' children, and dressed all out
                  in their best); but there was never one could hold a candle to my little sister.
                  Oh! and I hope you'll forgive me that word, ma'am; for I know it's no business I
                  had ever to call her so, or think of her so; but I was so proud of her!"</p>
               <p>"I don't need to forgive you, Teddy. It shows how much you loved her; and that is
                  what I like to think best."</p>
               <p>"But if you please, ma'am, will you tell me what is doing about looking for her?"
                  asked Teddy eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Very little now," answered the lady sadly. "The police traced Giovanni, the
                  Italian organ-grinder, to the station, where he took the cars for the West. At
                  Springfield, a man answering to his description, with a little girl, staid all
                  night; and next day the child danced—in the streets."</p>
               <p>The mother's face grew deadly pale as she said the last words, and she paused a
                  moment. Teddy turned away his head, and Mrs. Ginniss groaned aloud. Mrs. Legrange
                  went on hurriedly:—</p>
               <p>"Where they went afterwards is not yet discovered; but they are looking
                  everywhere. It seems so strange"—</p>
               <p>She fell into a momentary revery, thinking, as she thought so many, many times in
                  every day, how hard and strange it seemed that no clew could be found to her lost
                  darling beyond the terrible day that saw her dancing in the public streets,—an
                  ignominy, that, to the lady's sensitive mind, seemed almost equivalent to
                  death.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it would have been kinder had her husband and cousin told her the worst
                  they knew or suspected, and allowed her to mourn her child as dead. The acute
                  detective in whose hands the new clew had been placed had not only traced the
                  fugitives to Springfield, as Mrs. Legrange had said, but had ascertained at what
                  hour they left the hotel for the railway-station. It was impossible, however, to
                  discover for what point the Italian had purchased tickets, as the station-master
                  had no recollection of him, and the<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5676-00000121"/>
                  baggage-master was sure he had seen "no sich lot" as was described to him.</p>
               <p>And, from Springfield, a man may take passage to almost any point in the Union.
                  One startling fact remained, and upon this fact the whole report of the detective
                  turned.</p>
               <p>The train leaving Springfield for Albany upon the night when Giovanni left that
                  town, encountered, at a certain point, another train, which, by some
                  incomprehensible stupidity, was supposed to have passed that point half an hour
                  before.</p>
               <p>Consequences as usual,—frightful loss of life; a game of give and take in the
                  newspapers, as to who should bear the blame, finally resulting in a service of
                  plate to one party, and a donation in money to the other; several lawsuits brought
                  by enterprising widowers who demand consolation for the loss of their wives; by
                  other men, who, having skulked the draft, now found themselves minus both legs and
                  glory; by spinsters whose bandboxes had been crushed, and by young ladies whose
                  beauty had suffered damage from broken noses and scattered teeth.</p>
               <p>But, among all these sufferers, not one remembered seeing an Italian organ-grinder
                  with a little girl until, at the very last, a small boy was found, who averred,
                  that, on the morning after the disaster, he had seen a sort of box, with a little
                  creature chained to the top of it, floating down the river; and that the little
                  creature had seemed very much scared, and kept laughing, and showing all his
                  teeth; and that they had gone on and out of sight. And that was all he knew about
                  it.</p>
               <p>The river!—what use to question those dark and swollen waters? what use to demand
                  of them the bright form, that, it might be, slept beneath them?—it might be, had
                  been washed piecemeal to the ocean?</p>
               <p>At the brink of that river, mournful and terrible as Styx, river of the dead,
                  ended, that night, the story of many a life; and why not that of the child so
                  strangely lost, so nearly recovered, and now, perhaps, lost again forever?</p>
               <p>"We have found her, I am afraid, Tom," said Mr. Legrange to his cousin, as the
                  detective closed his report, and his two hearers looked at each other. "But,"
                  added the father, "keep on; keep every engine at work; search everywhere; spend
                  any amount of money that is needful; leave no chance untried. Remember, the reward
                  is always ready." And, when they were alone, he added,—</p>
               <p>"But, Tom, don't tell her. She can't bear it as we can.<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000122"/> Poor little Sunshine!" And, to show how well he
                  bore it, the father hid his face, and sobbed like a woman.</p>
               <p>"No, I won't say any thing," said Tom Burroughs in a strange, choked voice. And so
                  we come back to Mrs. Legrange wistfully saying, "It seems so strange"—</p>
               <p>And then, with the patience of a woman, she put aside her own great grief, and
                  added,—</p>
               <p>"But, Teddy, I am going to do something for you; and what shall it be? You wish to
                  be educated; do you not?"</p>
               <p>"O ma'am! but I've give it up now."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange smiled at the sudden enthusiasm and the sudden blank upon the boy's
                  face, and answered, almost gayly,—</p>
               <p>"But I have not given it up for you, Teddy.—By the way, Mrs. Ginniss, is that your
                  son's real name?—his whole name, I mean?"</p>
               <p>"It's short for Taodoor, I'm thinkin', ma'am; but joost Teddy we alluz calls
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes! Theodore. That is a very nice name, and will sound better, when he comes
                  to be a lawyer or doctor or minister, than Teddy. Don't you think so?"</p>
               <p>"Ye're right, ma'am: it's a dale the dacenter name uv the two; an' Taodoor I'll
                  call him iver an' always," said Mrs. Ginniss complacently.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking more of what other people would call him," said Mrs. Legrange,
                  smiling a little. "Some friends of mine are interested in a school and college at
                  the West,—somewhere in Ohio, I believe. It is a very fine school and the West is
                  the place for a young man who means to rise. So, Theodore, if you would like to
                  go, I shall be very happy to see to all your expenses until you graduate, and to
                  help you about settling in a profession, or in trade, as you like."</p>
               <p>Teddy's healthy face turned deadly white; and, although his lips trembled
                  violently, not a word came from between them. But Mrs. Ginniss, raising hands and
                  eyes to heaven, called down such a shower of blessings from so many and varied
                  sources, in such an inimitable brogue, that the pen refuses to transcribe her
                  rhapsody, as Mrs. Legrange failed to comprehend more than the half of it.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you are pleased; and it pleases me as much as it can you," said she,
                  half frightened at the Celtic vehemence of the other's manner and language.</p>
               <p>"I can't say what I want to, ma'am," spoke a low voice beside her; "but if you'll
                  believe I'm grateful, and wait<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5676-00000123"/> till
                  some time when I can show it better than I can now—that time will come, if we both
                  live. And when I'm a man, if she isn't found first, I'll go the world round but
                  I'll find her, and Jovarny too: I'll promise that."</p>
               <p>A wan smile played over the lovely face, as Mrs. Legrange, laying her hand upon
                  the boy's, said kindly,—</p>
               <p>"If she is not found before then, Teddy, I shall not be here to know it."</p>
               <p>Then going to the drawer, still standing open, she said,—</p>
               <p>"May I have some of these little things, Mrs. Ginniss; not all,—for I know that
                  you love them too,—but some of them?"</p>
               <p>So Mrs. Ginniss made a package of the relics; and Teddy asked and obtained the
                  privilege of carrying it home for his new friend, while James stalked
                  discontentedly behind.</p>
               <p>Upon the way, Mrs. Legrange said quietly, "I left a little money in the drawer,
                  Theodore. It is to buy you some new clothes, and whatever else you and your mother
                  need most. And I have just thought of something else. How would your mother like
                  living in the country?"</p>
               <p>"Very much, ma'am, I think. Her father had a farm in Ireland, and she is mighty
                  fond of telling about it."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Legrange has recently made me a present of a nice old farmhouse
                  somewhere in the western part of the State, thinking I might like to go there for
                  a few weeks in the summer. It is a lovely place, they say; and, if your mother
                  would like it, she might go there and keep the house for me. A man is going to
                  take care of the farm, and he could board with her."</p>
               <p>"That would be first-rate, ma'am," said Teddy enthusiastically. "But you're doing
                  too much for us entirely."</p>
               <p>"You were kind to her, Teddy; and I cannot do too much for you," said Mrs.
                  Legrange, lowering her veil.</p>

               <head type="sub">WELCOME HOME.</head>
               <p>"TIME they was here, ain't it, miss?" asked Mehitable Ross, wiping the flour from
                  her bare arms, and coming out upon the step of the door.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Dora: "I expect them every moment. Is tea all ready?"</p>
               <p>"All but the short-cakes. I hain't put them down to bake yet, because they're best
                  when they're first done. But the cold meat is sliced, and the strawberries dished,
                  and the johnny-cake a-baking."</p>
               <p>"Well, keep them all as nice as you can; and I will walk out a little, and meet
                  the wagon."</p>
               <p>"Take Argus along, you'd better, case you should meet one of them tiger-cats Silas
                  told on."</p>
               <p>Dora smiled, but called, "Argus!" and at the word a great hound came leaping from
                  one of the out-buildings, and fawned upon his young mistress; then, with stately
                  step and uplifted head, followed her along the faint track worn by the wheels of
                  the ox-cart in the short, sweet grass of the prairie.</p>
               <p>The young girl walked slowly, and, at the distance of some rods from the house,
                  stopped, and, leaning against the stem of a great chestnut-tree, stood looking
                  earnestly down the path as it wound into the forest, and out of sight. Then her
                  eyes turned slowly back, and lingered with a strange and solemn joy upon the scene
                  she had just left; while from her full heart came one whispered word that told the
                  whole story of her emotion,—</p>
               <p>"Home!"</p>
               <p>For this was Outpost, Dora's inheritance from her friend and father, Col. Blank;
                  and she felt to-night, as she waited to welcome home the family whose head she had
                  become, that her duties and responsibilities were indeed solemn and onerous. Not
                  too much so, however, for the courage and strength the young girl felt within her
                  soul,—the energy and will so long without an adequate field of action.</p>
               <p>"Plenty to do, and, thank God, plenty of health and strength to do it. Experience
                  will come of itself," thought Dora; and from her throbbing heart went up a "song
                  without words," of joy and praise and high resolve.</p>
               <p>It was June now; but the house at Outpost had only been<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000125"/> ready for occupancy a week or so. The family had
                  left Massachusetts about the first of October in the previous autumn, and had
                  spent the winter in Cincinnati; Dora having been reluctantly convinced of the
                  folly of proceeding to Iowa at that season. With the opening of spring, however,
                  she had made a journey thither, escorted by Charles Windsor, and accompanied by
                  Seth and Mehitable Ross,—a sturdy New-England couple, who were very glad, in
                  emigrating to the West, to avail themselves of the offers made by Dora, who
                  engaged the man as principal workman upon the new farm, and his wife as assistant
                  in the labors of the house.</p>
               <p>The site selected by Col. Blank proved a very satisfactory one. But Dora rejected
                  his plans of a house, submitted to her by Mr. Ferrars, as too expensive, and too
                  elaborate for the style of living she proposed; and chose, instead, a simple
                  log-cabin, divided into four rooms, with another at a little distance for the
                  accommodation of Ross and his wife, who were also to keep whatever additional
                  workmen should be required upon the place.</p>
               <p>These buildings, neatly and substantially formed of logs from the neighboring
                  wood, were placed at the top of a natural lawn half enclosed by primeval forest;
                  while at its foot nearly a quarter of a mile away, wound the blue waters of the
                  Des Moines; and beyond it, swept to the horizon, mile after mile of prairie,
                  limitless, apparently, as ocean, and, like ocean, solemnly beautiful in its
                  loneliness and calm.</p>
               <p>The house faced south; and eastward from its door, across the lawn and into the
                  rustling wood, wound the faint wheel-track, leading back to civilization, ease,
                  and safety: but Dora, standing beneath the chestnut-tree, fixed her dreamy eyes
                  upon the setting sun, and, half smiling at her own fancy, thought,—</p>
               <p>"I wonder if God doesn't make the western sky so beautiful just to draw us toward
                  it. There is so much to do here, and so few to do it!"</p>
               <p>A distant noise in the forest attracted her attention; and Argus, who had been
                  dreaming at the feet of his mistress, started up with a short bark.</p>
               <p>"Hush, Argus! It's the wagon; don't you know?" explained Dora, as she hastened
                  down the path, and, at the distance of a few hundred rods, caught sight of the
                  black heads of Pope and Pagan, and, the next moment, of the wagon and its
                  occupants.</p>
               <p>These were Karl, Kitty, and Sunshine, the two last of whom had remained all the
                  spring in Cincinnati, while Karl and Dora had vibrated between that city and
                  Outpost; for<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5676-00000126"/> Dora, while choosing to
                  superintend the building of her house and opening of the farm operations in
                  person, had not wished to expose her cousin or the delicate child to such
                  discomforts as she cheerfully and even gayly bore for herself.</p>
               <p>Kitty, moreover, had found the change from her native seclusion to a gay city very
                  pleasant; and had made so many acquaintances in Cincinnati, that she declared it
                  was a great deal worse than leaving home to abandon them all.</p>
               <p>"Oho! here's the general come to meet us! Whoa, Pope! don't you see your mistress?
                  Now, then!" shouted Karl; while Kitty cried,—</p>
               <p>"O Dora! I'm so glad to see you alive!" And little Sunshine, jumping up and down
                  in the front of the wagon, exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"Dora's come! Dora's come! Karlo said we'd come to Dora by and by!"</p>
               <p>"O you little darling! if Dora isn't glad to see you again! Kitty, how
                     <emph>do</emph> you do? I'm so glad to see you!"</p>
               <p>She had jumped into the wagon as she spoke; and, after giving Kitty a hearty kiss
                  and hug, she took Sunshine in her arms, and buried her face in the child's sunny
                  curls.</p>
               <p>"Am I your own little girl, Dora? and do you love me same as you always did?"
                  asked Sunshine anxiously. "Kitty said you'd so much to think about now, that maybe
                  you wouldn't care for us."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Kitty never meant that, dear," said Dora quickly; and Kitty, with rather a
                  forced laugh, added,—</p>
               <p>"Of course I didn't. It was only a joke, Molly. You talked so much about Dora, I
                  wanted to plague you a little."</p>
               <p>The child looked earnestly at her for a moment; and then, putting her arms about
                  Dora's neck, hid her face upon her bosom, murmuring,—</p>
               <p>"I'm glad I've got Dora again!"</p>
               <p>"Well, now everybody else is attended to, hasn't the general a word for his humble
                  orderly?" asked Karl, turning to smile over his shoulder at the group behind.</p>
               <p>"Why, you jealous old Karl! you know you've only been away two weeks, and the
                  girls I have not seen for almost as many months: besides, I told you not to call
                  me general, and yourself orderly."</p>
               <p>"Oh! that reminds me of a new name for pet. You know she persists in calling me
                  Karlo; so I have given her the title of Dolce: and the two of us together are
                  going some day to paint pictures far fairer than those of our great original."</p>
               <p>"Carlo Dolce? Yes: Mr. Brown told me about him<pb n="252-253"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000127"/> once, and said his name only meant sweet Charley,"
                  said Dora simply.</p>
               <p>"I wonder, then, that you should have left it for Sunshine to discover how
                  appropriate the name is to me," said Karl with mock gravity.</p>
               <p>"I'll call you sweet Charley if you like; only it must be at all times, and before
                  all persons," said Dora roguishly.</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you," replied her cousin, laughing. "Fancy Parson Brown's face if he
                  should hear such a title, or Seth's astonishment if you told him to call sweet
                  Charley to dinner! But isn't Dolce a pretty name? Let us really adopt it for
                  her."</p>
               <p>"Well, if she likes; but I shall call her Sunshine still sometimes."</p>
               <p>"What say, pet? will you have Dolce for a name?" asked Karl, turning to pinch the
                  little ear peeping from Sunshine's curls.</p>
               <p>"I don't know; would you, Dora?" asked the child, gravely deliberating.</p>
               <p>"Yes: I think it is pretty."</p>
               <p>"And Kitty sha'n't call me Molly any more; shall she?"</p>
               <p>"Don't you like Molly?"</p>
               <p>"No: because that man in Cincinnati asked me if my last name was Coddle; and it
                  ain't."</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! what an odd little thing she is!" exclaimed Kitty. "It was Mr. Thomson,
                  Dora; and he is so witty, you know! And one day he asked the child if her name
                  wasn't Miss Molly Coddle, just for a joke, you see; and we all laughed: but she
                  ran away; and, when I went to my room, there she was crying, and wouldn't come
                  down again for ever so long. She's a regular little fuss-bunch about such
                  things."</p>
               <p>"Very strange, when you and I are so fond of being ridiculed and laughed at!"
                  remarked Karl gravely; and Sunshine whispered,—</p>
               <p>"Am I a fuss-bunch, Dora?"</p>
               <p>Dora did not answer, except by a little pat upon the child's rosy cheek, as she
                  exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"Here we are! Look, Kitty! that is home; and we must bid each other welcome, since
                  there is no one to do it for us both except Mehitable, and I don't believe she
                  will think of it."</p>
               <p>"Well, I must say, Dora, you've got things to going a great deal better than I
                  should expect," said Kitty graciously, as she looked about her. "Why, that
                  sweetbrier beside the door, and the white rose the other side, are just like ours
                  at home; and the woodbine growing up the corner too!"</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5676-00000128"/>
               <p>"They came from the old home, every one of them," said Dora, smiling happily. "I
                  wrote in the spring, and asked Mr. Burroughs to be so kind as to ask whoever lives
                  in the house to take up a little root of each of the roses, and send them to me by
                  express. You know he said, when we left, that we should have any thing we liked
                  from the place, then or afterwards. So he wrote such a pleasant note, and said he
                  had sold the house to a cousin of his, a Mr. Legrange, who had made a present of
                  it to his wife; but I could have the slips all the same: and next day, to be sure,
                  they came, all nicely packed in matting, and some other plants with them. Karl
                  brought them out and set them in April; and they are growing beautifully, you see.
                  Wasn't Mr. Burroughs good?"</p>
               <p>Kitty did not answer. She was bending low over the sweetbrier, and inhaling the
                  fragrance of its leaves. Karl and Sunshine had driven to the barn, and the girls
                  remained alone. Dora glanced sharply at her cousin once, and then was turning
                  away, when Kitty detained her, and said in a low voice,—</p>
               <p>"My mother planted that sweetbrier, and used to call it her Marnie-bush, after
                  me."</p>
               <p>"I know it," said Dora softly.</p>
               <p>"And that was the reason you brought it here. And I have been cross to you so
                  much! But I did love her so, Dora! oh, you don't know how much I loved my mother!
                  That is the reason I never will let any one call me Marnie now. It was the name
                  she always called me, though Kitty belongs to me too; but she said it so softly!
                  And to think you should bring the Marnie-bush all the way from Massachusetts!"</p>
               <p>"I thought you would like it, dear," said Dora absently; while her eyes grew dim
                  and vague, and around her mouth settled the white, hard line, that, in her
                  reticent nature, showed an emotion no less intense because it was suppressed.</p>
               <p>Then her arm stole round Kitty's waist, and she whispered in her ear,—</p>
               <p>"We two motherless girls ought to feel for each other, and love each other better
                  than those who never knew what it is; shouldn't we, Kitty?"</p>
               <p>"We should that, Dora," returned her cousin with emphasis; "and I don't believe I
                  shall forget again right away. Let us begin from now, and see how good we can be
                  to each other."</p>
               <p>Dora's kisses, except for Sunshine, were almost as rare as<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000129"/> her tears; but she gave one now to Kitty, who
                  accepted it as sufficient answer to her proposition.</p>
               <p>At this moment, Mehitable, who had, at the appearance of the wagon, rushed home to
                  give a finishing touch to her toilet, was seen crossing the little interval
                  between the two houses with an elaborate air of unconsciousness of observation,
                  and carrying a large white handkerchief by its exact centre.</p>
               <p>"My!—how fine we look!" whispered Kitty.</p>
               <p>"This is my cousin, Miss Windsor, Mehitable," said Dora simply. "I believe you
                  didn't see her in Cincinnati?"</p>
               <p>"No: she was away when we was there.—Happy to make your acquaintance, Miss
                  Windsor. How do you like out here?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know yet. I never tried keeping house in a log-cabin. You'll have
                  to show me how, I expect," said Kitty rather loftily.</p>
               <p>"Lor! I guess you know as much as I do about it. I never see a log-cabin in my
                  life till we come out here. My father had a fust-rate house, cla'borded and
                  shingled, and all, down in Maine; and we alluz had a plenty to do with of every
                  sort: so I hain't no experience at all in this sort of way."</p>
               <p>"But you have a way of getting on without it that is almost as good. I don't know
                  what I should have done without Mehitable, Kitty; and I dare say she will help you
                  very much by telling all the ingenious ways she has contrived to make our rude
                  accommodations answer. You know, as we are all beginning together, each must help
                  on the other; and we must all keep up our courage, and try to be contented."</p>
               <p>"Well, I must say I never see one that kep' up her own courage, and everybody
                  else's, like her, since I was born into the world," said Mehitable, turning
                  confidentially to Kitty. "Talk of my helping her! Lor! if it hadn't been for her,
                  I never would have stopped here over night, in the world. Why, the first night, I
                  didn't do nothing but roar the whole night long. Mr. Ross he said I'd raise the
                  river if I didn't stop: but in the morning down come Miss Dora, looking so bright
                  and sunshiny, that I couldn't somehow open my head to say I wouldn't stop; and
                  then she begun to talk"—</p>
               <p>"Mehitable, the short-cake is done. Will you speak to Mr. Windsor?" called Dora
                  from within; and Kitty entered, saying,—</p>
               <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5676-00000130"/>
               <p>"How nice the tea-table looks!—just like home, Dora; the old India china and
                  all."</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> home, Kit-cat. Here is Karl, and here is little Sunshine.
                  Come, friends, and let us sit down to our first meal in the new house," said Dora:
                  and Kitty, subduing a little feeling of fallen dignity, seated herself at the side
                  of the table; leaving the head for Dora, who colored a little, but took it
                  quietly.</p>

               <head type="sub">LIFE AT OUTPOST.</head>
               <p>AND now began for each member of the family at Outpost a new and active life.</p>
               <p>Kitty, who, young as she was, had already achieved reputation as a notable
                  housekeeper, found quite enough to attend to in domestic matters, and, with
                  Mehitable's help and counsel, soon had all the interests and nearly all the
                  comforts of New-England farm-life established in her Western home. Even the
                  marigolds her mother had always raised as a flavoring to broths; and the catnip,
                  motherwort, peppermint, and tansy, grown and dried as sovereign remedies in case
                  of illness; and the parsley, sage, and marjoram, to be used in various branches of
                  cookery,—flourished in their garden-bed under Kitty's fostering care; while poor
                  Silas Ross was fairly worried, in spite of himself, into digging and roofing an
                  ice-cellar in the intervals of his more important duties.</p>
               <p>"Now we'll see, another summer, if we can't have some butter that's like butter,
                  and not like soft-soap," remarked<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5676-00000131"/> Kitty
                  complacently, when the unhappy Silas announced his task complete.</p>
               <p>"And now I hope I can sleep in my bed o' nights without hearing 'Ice-house,
                  ice-house!' till I'm sick o' the sound of ice," muttered Silas, walking away.</p>
               <p>It is not to be averred, however, that all this thrift was established without
                  much commotion or many stormy scenes; and, not unfrequently, Mehitable Ross
                  announced to her husband that "she wouldn't stan' it nohow, to be nosed round this
                  way by a gal not so old as herself!" And Kitty "declared to gracious" that she
                  "never saw such a topping piece as that Hitty Ross since she was born;" and, if
                  "folks undertook to work for other folks, they ought to be willing to do the way
                  they were told;" and she'd "rather do the whole alone than keep round after that
                  contrary creature, seeing that she didn't get the upper-hands as soon as her back
                  was turned!"</p>
               <p>But Dora, without appearing to listen or to look, heard all and saw all. Dora,
                  cheerful, energetic, and calm, knew how to heal, without appearing to notice the
                  wound; had a faculty, all her own, of leading the mind, vexed with a thousand
                  trifles, to the contemplation of some aim so grand, some thought so high, some
                  love or beauty so serene, that it turned back to daily life calm and refreshed,
                  and strengthened to do or to endure, with new courage.</p>
               <p>"Somehow I felt ashamed of jawing so about that wash, when Dora came in, and put
                  her hands into the tub, and, while she was rubbing away, began to tell what a crop
                  of corn we're going to have; and how the folks down South, the freedmen and all,
                  might have plenty to eat, if every one did as well as we're doing," said Mehitable
                  to her husband.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Seth: "she stood by me there in the sun as much as an hour, and
                  told the cutest story you ever heard about the Injins believing that corn is a
                  live creter, and appeared once, in the shape of a young man named Odahmin, to one
                  of the Injin chiefs called Hiawatha; and they had a wrastle. Hiawatha beat, and
                  killed the other feller, and buried him up in the ground; but he hadn't more 'n
                  got him under 'fore up he come agin, or ruther some Injin-corn come up: but they
                  called the green leaves his clothes; and the tossel atop, his plume; and the
                  sprouts was his hands, each holding an ear of corn, that he give to Hiawatha, just
                  as a feller that's whipped gives another his hat, you know."</p>
               <p>"Do the Injins believe all that now?" asked Mehitable contemptuously.</p>
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5676-00000132"/>
               <p>"They do so. But, I tell you, I never knew how those two rows got hoed while she
                  was talking: they seemed to slip right along somehow; and, after she was gone, the
                  time seemed dreadful short till sundown, I was thinking so busy of what she
                  said."</p>
               <p>"Guess you'd been cross 'cause that cultivator didn't come; hadn't you?" asked
                  Mehitable slyly.</p>
               <p>"Yes: I felt real mad all the morning about it, and was pretty grumpy to Windsor;
                  for I thought he might as well have sent a week ago. But, by George! I'd like to
                  see the feller that 'ud be grumpy to her."</p>
               <p>"Well, Dora," Kitty was saying at the same moment, "I'm glad you've got home; for
                  the first thing isn't ready for supper, and I've just done ironing. That Hit went
                  off home an hour ago; said her head ached, and she'd got to get the men's supper.
                  I do declare, I'd like to shake that woman till her teeth rattled; and I believe
                  I'll do it some day!"</p>
               <p>"How beautifully the clothes look, Kitty! I think they bleach even whiter here
                  than they used to in the old drying yard. But I am sorry you ironed that white
                  waist of mine: I was going to do it myself. Now, Sunshine, come and tell Aunt
                  Kitty about the woodchuck and her baby that we saw; and how we caught little
                  chucky, as you called him; and all the rest."</p>
               <p>"Dear me! I can't stop. Well, come and sit in my lap, Dolly, and tell if you want
                  to. Dora, do sit and rest a minute: you look all tired out."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! but Karl is, I am afraid. He walked away out behind the wheat-lot this
                  afternoon to see to setting some traps for the poor little things that come to eat
                  it. I never saw such a boy when there is any thing to be done. He goes right at
                  it, no matter what lies between."</p>
               <p>"You're right there, Dora; and he always was so from a child. Well, Dolly, what's
                  the story?"</p>
               <p>"Don't call me Dolly, please," said the little girl coaxingly.</p>
               <p>"Well, Dolce, then," said Kitty, smiling with renewed good-nature. And while
                  Sunshine, all unconsciously, completed by her prattle the cure that Dora had
                  begun, the latter quietly and rapidly finished the preparations for tea.</p>
               <p>As for Sunshine, never did a child so well deserve her name. In the house or on
                  the prairie, running with Argus, walking demurely beside Karl, or riding behind
                  Dora upon the stout little pony reserved for the use of the young mistress of the
                  place, it was always as a gleam of veritable sunshine that she came; and no heart
                  so dark, or temper so gloomy, as to resist her sweet influence. Constant exercise
                  and fresh air, proper food, and the rigid sanitary laws established<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000133"/> lished by Dora, had brought to the child's cheek a
                  richer bloom than it had ever known before; while her blue eyes seemed two
                  sparkling fountains of joy, and a vivid life danced and glittered even among her
                  sunny curls. Lithe and straight, and strong of limb too, grew our slender little
                  Cerito; and, although every motion was still one of grace, it was now the assured
                  grace of strength, instead of that of fragility. She danced too, but it was with
                  the west wind, who, rough companion that he was, whirled her round and round in
                  his strong arms, or tossed her hair in a bright cloud across her face; while he
                  snatched her hat, and sent it spinning into the prairie; or kissed the laugh from
                  her lips, and carried it away to the wild woods to mock at the singing-birds.
                  Argus too—what friends he and the child, who at first had been afraid of him,
                  became before the summer was through! What talks they held! How merrily they
                  laughed together! and how serenely Argus listened while Sunshine told him long
                  histories of imaginary wanderings among the clouds, in enchanted forests, or "away
                  beyond the blue up in the sky"! Confidences these; for, as the narrator
                  whispered,—</p>
               <p>"Dora doesn't like dream-stories, and Kitty says, 'Oh, nonsense!' and Karlo
                  laughs: so you mustn't tell a word, old Argus." And Argus, wagging his tail, and
                  blinking his bright brown eyes, promised never to tell, and faithfully kept the
                  promise.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it was a vague sense of loneliness in these fancies; perhaps it was the
                  lingering longing for something she had lost even from her memory, and yet not
                  wholly from her heart, where, as we all know, linger loves for which we no longer
                  have a name or a thought; perhaps it was only the dim reflex of that agony
                  consuming her mother's heart, and the earnestness with which it longed for her:
                  but something there was, that, at intervals, cast a sudden shadow over Sunshine's
                  heart; something that made her pale and still, and deepened the dimples at the
                  corners of her mouth, until each might have held a tear. At these times, she would
                  always steal away by herself if possible; sometimes, and especially if the stars
                  were out, to sit with folded hands, gazing at the sky; sometimes to lie upon her
                  little bed, her eyes fixed on vacancy, until the bright tears gathered, and rolled
                  slowly down her cheeks: but, oftenest of all, she would call Argus, and, with one
                  hand upon his glossy head, wander away to the dim forest, and seated at the foot
                  of one of those patriarchal trees, the hound lying close beside her, would talk to
                  him as she never talked to human ears.</p>
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5676-00000134"/>
               <p>Once, Karl, returning from an expedition to a distant part of the farm, saw her
                  thus, and half in fun, half in curiosity, crept up behind the great oak at whose
                  foot she sat, and listened.</p>
               <p>"And up there in heaven, Argus," she was saying, "it's all so beautiful! and no
                  one ever speaks loud or cross; and every one has shining white clothes, and
                  flowers on their heads; and some one is there—I don't know—I guess it's an angel;
                  but she's got soft hands, and such pretty shiny hair, and eyes all full of loving
                  me. I dream about her sometimes; but I don't know who she is: and you mustn't
                  tell, Argus. Sometimes I want to die, so as to go to heaven and look for her.
                  Argus, do you want to go to heaven?"</p>
               <p>The brown eyes said that Argus wished whatever she did; and Sunshine
                  continued:—</p>
               <p>"Well, some day we'll go. I don't know just how; I don't believe we'd find the way
                  if we went now: but some day I shall know, and then I'll tell you. Sometimes I
                  feel so lonesome, Argus! oh, so dreadful homesick! but I don't now. You're a real
                  little comforter, Argus. That's what Dora called me the other night when Kitty was
                  cross: and Dora cried a little when she came to bed, and didn't know I was awake;
                  and I kissed her just so, Argus, and so."</p>
               <p>In the game of romps and kisses that ensued, Karl stole away, and, after repeating
                  the child's prattle to Dora, said thoughtfully,—</p>
               <p>"There's something strange about her, Dora; something different from any of us.
                  She seems so finely and delicately made, and as if one rude jar might destroy the
                  whole tone of her life. If ever a creature was formed of peculiar, instead of
                  common clay, it is Sunshine."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and she must be shielded accordingly," said Dora. But, as she walked on
                  beside Karl, she vaguely wondered if there were not natures as finely strung and
                  as sensitive to suffering as Sunshine's, but united with so reticent an exterior,
                  and such outward strength, as never to gain the sympathy or appreciation so freely
                  bestowed upon the exquisite child.</p>
               <p>Such introspection, however, was no part of Dora's healthy temperament; and the
                  next moment she had plunged into a talk upon farm-matters with her cousin, and
                  displayed such shrewdness and clear-sighted wisdom upon the subject, that Capt.
                  Karl laughingly exclaimed, as they entered the house,—</p>
               <p>"O general! why weren't you born a man?"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <head type="sub">KITTY IN THE WOODS.</head>
               <p>LEFT to his own guidance, Capt. Karl would have asked no better life than to
                  follow Dora about the farm, or fulfil for her such duties as she could not
                  conveniently perform for herself. Nor was he ever troubled, as a man of less sweet
                  and genial temper might have been, by fears, lest, in thus attending upon his
                  cousin's pleasure, he sacrificed somewhat of manly dignity and the awful supremacy
                  of the sterner sex. "Dora knows" had become to Karl a sufficient explanation of
                  every thing, either in the character or the administration of the girl-farmer,
                  however mysterious it might seem to others; and to defer to Dora's judgment and
                  wishes was perhaps pleasanter and safer in the eyes of the young man than to
                  attempt to consult his own.</p>
               <p>But, pleasant though this life might be to both, it came by no means within the
                  scope of Dora's plans; and, so soon as the family were thoroughly settled at
                  Outpost, Karl found himself urged by irresistible pressure to the pursuance of his
                  medical studies.</p>
               <p>Five miles from Outpost, in the youthful town of Greenfield, was already
                  established a respectable physician of the old school, who, troubled with certain
                  qualms and doubts as to the ability of the system he had practised so many years
                  to bear the scrutiny of the new lights thrown upon it by the progress of science,
                  was very glad to secure the services, and even advice, of a young man educated in
                  the best medical schools of the Eastern States; and not only consented to take
                  Karl into his office as student until the nominal term of his studies should have
                  expired, but offered him a partnership in his practice so soon as he should
                  receive his diploma.</p>
               <p>The arrangement was accordingly made; and every morning after breakfast, Karl,
                  often with a rueful face, often with an audible protest, mounted his horse, and
                  rode to Greenfield, leaving the household at Outpost to a long day of various
                  occupations until his return at night.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Dora, upon Max, her little Indian pony, would accompany him a few miles,
                  or as far as his road led toward the scene of her own labors; but no Spartan dame
                  or Roman matron could more sternly have resisted<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000136"/> the young man's frequent entreaties to be allowed
                  to accompany her farther than the point at which their roads diverged.</p>
               <p>"No, sir! You to your work, and I to mine. Suppose I were to neglect the farm, and
                  come to sit in Dr. Gershom's office all day," argued the fair young moralist, but
                  found herself rather disconcerted by her pupil's gleeful laugh, as he
                  replied,—</p>
               <p>"Good, good! Try it once, do; and let me see if it would be so very bad. I think I
                  could forgive you."</p>
               <p>"Suppose, then, instead of arguing any more with you, I jump Max over this brook,
                  and leave you where you are?" said Dora, a little vexed; and, suiting the action
                  to the word, she was off before her cousin could remonstrate.</p>
               <p>In the evening of the day when this little scene occurred, Karl, upon his return
                  home, found Dora seated with Sunshine upon the grass under the great
                  chestnut-tree.</p>
               <p>"A letter for you, you horrid tyrant!" said he, taking one from his pocket, and
                  tossing it into her lap.</p>
               <p>"She isn't; and you are a naughty old Karlo to say such names!" cried Sunshine,
                  flashing her blue eyes indignantly upon the laughing face of the young man.</p>
               <p>"Such names as what, Dolce?" asked he, jumping from his horse, and trying to catch
                  the child, who evaded his grasp, and replied with dignity,—</p>
               <p>"It isn't any consequence, Karlo. She isn't it, and you know she isn't."</p>
               <p>"But it is of consequence; for I don't know what it is she isn't. Please tell me,
                  mousey; won't you?"</p>
               <p>"She isn't a tireout, you know she isn't, then. You sha'n't laugh! Dora, shall
                  Karlo laugh at me? shall he?"</p>
               <p>"No, dear, he won't; but you mustn't be a cross little girl if he does. Now run to
                  the house, and tell Aunt Kitty that Karlo has come home, and see if tea is
                  ready."</p>
               <p>The child put up her lips for a kiss, bestowed a glance of dignified severity upon
                  the offender, and walked towards the house with measured steps for a little
                  distance; then, with the frolicsome caprice of a kitten, made a little caper in
                  the air, and danced on, singing, in her clear, sweet voice,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Dear, dear, what can the matter be?</l>
                        <l>Karlo can't stay from here!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Funny child!" exclaimed the object of the stave. "A true little woman, with her
                  loves and spites. Who is the letter from, Dolo?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brown," said Dora, slowly folding it, and rising from her seat under the tree
                  to return to the house.</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5676-00000137"/>
               <p>"Aha! Seems to me the parson is not so attentive as he used to be. Have you and he
                  fallen out?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed! we are the best of friends; and, in proof of it, this letter is to
                  say he is coming to make a little visit at Outpost, if convenient to us."</p>
               <p>"And is it convenient?" asked Karl somewhat curtly.</p>
               <p>"Certainly; or, at least, we can make it so. Either you can take him into your
                  room, or Kitty can give him hers, and come into mine."</p>
               <p>Karl said nothing; but, as they walked toward the house, his face remained
                  unusually serious, and he seemed to be thinking deeply. Dora glanced at him once
                  or twice, and at last asked abruptly,—</p>
               <p>"Don't you want Mr. Brown to come, Karl?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, certainly, if you do. It is your own house, and you have a right to
                  your own guests," replied the young man coldly.</p>
               <p>Dora colored indignantly.</p>
               <p>"For shame, Karl! Did I ever say a thing like that to you in the old house? and
                  would you have been pleased if I had?"</p>
               <p>"No, Dolo; and no again. But you never were a selfish fool, like me. Yes, I am
                  glad Mr. Brown is coming; and I think I will stay at Greenfield while he is here.
                  Then he can have my room."</p>
               <p>"No, no: that won't do at all. He comes to see us all; and, of course, we can
                  manage a room without turning you out. Kitty can come into mine"—</p>
               <p>"Dora, what is the day of the month?"</p>
               <p>"The 17th, I believe."</p>
               <p>"Yes, the 17th of August; and seven days more will bring the 24th of August,
                  Dora."</p>
               <p>"Of course. Do you suppose he will be here by that time?" asked Dora
                  unconsciously.</p>
               <p>Karl looked at her in a sort of comic despair.</p>
               <p>"Dora, if you were not the most utterly truthful of girls, you would be the most
                  cruel of coquettes."</p>
               <p>Dora's eyes rose swiftly to his face, read it for a moment, and then fell; while a
                  sudden color dyed her own.</p>
               <p>"You remember the date now?" asked Karl, almost mockingly. "See here!" and, taking
                  from his pocket the memorandum-book of a year before, he opened it to a page
                  bearing only the words,—</p>
               <p>"Dora. Wednesday, Aug. 24."</p>
               <p>"O Karl! I thought"—</p>
               <p>"Stop, general! It is I who must be officer of the day<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000138"/> on this occasion; and I forbid one word. I only
                  wished to let you see that I have not forgotten. And so Mr. Brown is coming to see
                  us?"</p>
               <p>Again Dora glanced in perplexity at her cousin's face, but, this time, said not a
                  word. Indeed, if she had wished, there was hardly time; for Kitty, appearing at
                  the door, called,—</p>
               <p>"Come, folks, come! Supper is ready and cooling."</p>
               <p>"Coming, Kit-kat; and so is somebody else!" cried Karl.</p>
               <p>"Somebody? Christmas is coming, I suppose; but not just yet. Did you hear that
                  over at Greenfield?" replied Kitty, resting her hands on her brother's shoulders,
                  and graciously receiving his kiss of greeting.</p>
               <p>"It's not Christmas, but Parson Brown, who is coming; and I brought the news from
                  Greenfield, although I did not know it until I arrived here," said Karl.</p>
               <p>"Oh, a letter to Dora!" exclaimed Kitty quickly; and over her face, a moment
                  before so bright, fell a scowling cloud, as she turned away, and busied herself
                  with putting tea upon the table.</p>
               <p>The meal was rather a silent one. Kitty was decidedly sulky, Dora thoughtful, and
                  Karl a little bitter in his forced gayety; so that Sunshine, sensitive as a
                  mimosa, ate but little, and, creeping close to Dora's side as they rose from the
                  table, whispered,—</p>
               <p>"What's the reason it isn't happier, Dora?"</p>
               <p>"Aren't you happy, pet? Come and help me wash the teacups, and tell me how the
                  kitties do to-day. Have you given them their milk?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose you can do up these dishes without me. I got tea all alone; and I'd
                  like to take my turn at a walk, or something pleasant, now," said Kitty
                  crossly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, do, Kitty. Dolce and I will do all that is to be done. It isn't much,
                  because you always clear up as you go along," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"There's no need of leaving every thing round, the way some folks do. Dolly, I do
                  wish you'd set up your chair when you've done with it; and here's a mess of
                  stuff"—</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't throw it away, Kitty! It's my moss; and I'm going to make the pussies a
                  house of stones, and have it grow all over moss. Dora said I might— Oh, oh! you're
                  real naughty and ugly now, Kitty Windsor; and I sha'n't love you, and Argus shall
                  bite you"—</p>
               <p>But Kitty, with a contemptuous laugh, was already walking<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000139"/> ing away, taking especial pains to tread upon the
                  bits of bright moss as they lay scattered along the path.</p>
               <p>"Dora, see! I do hate—no, I dislike—Kitty, just as hard as I can; and I can't get
                  any more pretty moss"—</p>
               <p>The child was crying passionately; and Dora left every thing to take her in her
                  arms, and soothe and quiet her.</p>
               <p>"Aunt Kitty is very neat and nice, little Sunshine; and the moss has earth
                  clinging to it that might drop on the floor; and, besides, it takes up room, and
                  we have so little,—hardly more than a mouse has in its nest. Oh! I never told you
                  how I found a whole nest of mice in one of my slippers once,—six little tiny
                  fellows, no bigger than your thumb; and every one with two little black, beady
                  eyes, and a funny little tail."</p>
               <p>"When was it? When you was a little teenty girl, like me? And was you afraid of
                  the big mouse? What did you do with them?"</p>
               <p>"Come, wipe the teaspoons, and I will tell you," said Dora, going back to her
                  work; and, the April cloud having passed, the Sunshine was as bright as ever.</p>
               <p>Karl, behind his newspaper, heard, saw, and understood the whole; and his mental
                  comment might have seemed to some hearers but little connected with the scene that
                  called it forth. It was simply,—</p>
               <p>"Confound old Brown!"</p>
               <p>Kitty, meantime, had walked rapidly towards the wood; but though the sunset-clouds
                  were gorgeous, the lights and shadows of the forest rare and shifting, and the
                  birds jubilant in their evening song, she saw nothing, heard nothing, knew
                  nothing, except the tumult in her own heart.</p>
               <p>For, in the recesses of the wood, she paused, and throwing herself upon the
                  ground, her face hidden upon her arms, gave way to a paroxysm of tears. Then,
                  rising to her feet as suddenly, she paced up and down, her hands clinched before
                  her, her black brows knit, and her mouth hard and sullen.</p>
               <p>"I can't help it," muttered she: "it's the way I was made, and the way I shall
                  die, I expect. I know I'm mean and hateful, and not half as good as she; but— Oh!
                  it's too bad, too bad!—it's cruel, and I can't bear it! Mother loved me,—yes, she
                  loved me best of every thing; and that hateful Pic killed her: whose fault was
                  that but Dora's? Then Charlie—what does he care for me beside her? and, and— Well,
                  perhaps Mr. Brown never would have noticed me at any rate; but, while she's round,
                  he has no eyes for any one else. Even the child, and the cats, and the dog, and
                  the horses,<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5676-00000140"/> every living thing, loves
                  her better than me; and now he's coming to court her right before my eyes! I wish
                  I was dead! I wish I'd never been born! I'm not fit to live!"</p>
               <p>She then threw herself again upon the ground, pressing her burning forehead
                  against the cool moss, and grasping handfuls of the leaves rustling about her,
                  while she wailed again and again,—</p>
               <p>"I'm not fit to live,—not fit to live! Oh, I wish I was dead this minute! O God!
                  if you love me any better than the rest, let me die, let me die this minute; for I
                  am not fit to live."</p>
               <p>"Then you cannot be fit to die, my child," said a voice above her; and, starting
                  up, Kitty found herself confronted by a tall, fine-looking man, of about thirty
                  years of age; his handsome face just now wearing an expression of sorrowful
                  sternness as he fixed his eyes upon Kitty's, which fell before them.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brown!" stammered she.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Kitty: my journey has been more rapid than I could have expected; and I
                  arrived at Greenfield about an hour ago. Finding you so near, I took a horse, and
                  came out here to-night. You did not hear me approach; and, when I saw you through
                  the trees, I dismounted, and came to ask you what was the matter. I heard only
                  your last words, and perhaps I should not have noticed them; yet, as a friend of
                  you and yours, I will say again, Kitty, he who is not fit to live should feel
                  himself most unfit to die, which is but to live with all the passions that made
                  life unendurable made ours forever."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so? If I should die now, should I feel just as badly when I came to
                  in the other world?" asked Kitty with at startled look.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown smiled, as he answered,—</p>
               <p>"I cannot think, Kitty, that your remorse or your sorrows can be as deep as you
                  fancy. Perhaps they are only trifling vexations connected with outside matters,
                  not rising from real wrong within. But you won't want to hear a sermon before I
                  even reach the house: so come and show me the way there, and tell me how you all
                  are."</p>
               <p>"Dora is very well," said Kitty, so crisply, that Mr. Brown glanced at her
                  sharply, and walked on in silence. Presently he said,—</p>
               <p>"You must not think, Kitty, that I mean to treat your troubles lightly, whatever
                  they may be. Think about them a little longer by yourself; and in a day or two, if
                  they still seem as unendurable, perhaps it will relieve you to talk to<pb
                     n="280-281" xml:id="VAC5676-00000141"/> me as plainly as you choose. I shall be
                  very glad to help you if I can, Kitty; very glad and willing. You must look upon
                  me as another brother."</p>
               <p>"Or a cousin, maybe, sir?" suggested Kitty, turning away her head.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE FOX UNDER THE ROBE.</head>
               <p>DORA sitting upon the doorstep, with Sunshine nestled close beside her, was quite
                  astonished to see Mr. Brown appearing from the forest with Kitty, as his letter
                  had named no day for his arrival; and she had not expected him so soon.</p>
               <p>She went to meet him, however, with a greeting of unaffected cordiality; and as,
                  while holding out her hand, she raised to his her clear and steadfast eyes, the
                  young man's somewhat serious face lighted with a sudden, happy glow, making it so
                  handsome, that Kitty, eagerly watching the meeting, turned white to the very lips,
                  and hastily passed on toward the house.</p>
               <p>"Come, Dolce," said she, "I will put you to bed. Dora's lover has come to see her,
                  and she won't have a look for either of us to-night."</p>
               <p>"I love you, Kitty; and I don't mind if you did throw away my moss. I won't bring
                  any more into the house."</p>
               <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5676-00000142"/>
               <p>But Sunshine, well disposed as, through Dora's careful suggestions, she had become
                  toward Kitty, was rather alarmed than pleased at the sudden embrace in which she
                  found herself wrapped, and the eager kisses, among which Kitty whispered,—</p>
               <p>"O Dolce! do you, do you love poor Kitty a little? You're an angel, and I'm real
                  sorry about the moss; but you can get some more, can't you? I'll help you hunt for
                  it to-morrow while they're gone to walk or ride. They'll be off all day; but we
                  won't mind. Do you love me, Dolly?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do, Kitty; and I know a place where the moss is so thick, you can't step
                  unless you put your foot on it. But I didn't, 'cause"—</p>
               <p>"'Cause what, you darling?"</p>
               <p>"'Cause the little creatures that live in the woods come and dance there nights,
                  and they wouldn't like it if it was dirty."</p>
               <p>"What creatures? The woodchucks?"</p>
               <p>"Why, no, Aunt Kitty! the little girls and boys, or something. They whisper way
                  off among the trees, and dance too, just when the sun sets. Didn't you ever see
                  them skipping in and out among the trees just as far off as you could look?"</p>
               <p>"Those are shadows, Dolly; and the whispering in the trees is the wind. You
                  mustn't have so many fancies, child, or by and by you'll get cracked."</p>
               <p>"Then you can boil me in milk, just as you did the teacup," murmured Sunshine,
                  half asleep.</p>
               <p>Kitty made no answer, but, smoothing the sheet over the little girl, went to seat
                  herself at the open window.</p>
               <p>Far off upon the prairie she heard the night-winds come and go,—now moaning like
                  some vast spirit wandering disquieted, now falling soft and low as the breath of
                  the sleeping earth; and the vague voice and the cool touch seemed to quiet the
                  fever of the young girl's heart, although she knew not how or why.</p>
               <p>Above, in the purple skies, stood all the host of heaven, looking down with solemn
                  benediction upon the earth, lying peaceful and loving beneath their gaze; and even
                  Kitty—poor, lonely, heartsick Kitty—lifted her hot, tearful face toward them, and
                  felt the holy calm descend upon her aching heart.</p>
               <p>Falling upon her knees, she raised her arms yearningly toward heaven; and her
                  whole soul struggled upward in the cry,—</p>
               <p>"Oh I wish I could, I wish I could, be good! O God!<pb n="284-285"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000143"/> make me good enough to die and go to where my
                  mother is!"</p>
               <p>A light step upon the stair, a gentle hand upon the latch, and strange Kitty,
                  perverse even among her best impulses, started up, and stood cold and silent in
                  the darkness.</p>
               <p>"Kitty!" said Dora's voice softly.</p>
               <p>"Well. I'm here."</p>
               <p>"Won't you come down now? Sunshine is asleep; isn't she?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, won't you come?"</p>
               <p>"By and by: I've got to see to the beds. Where is Mr. Brown going to sleep?"</p>
               <p>"I thought you might give him your room, and come in here."</p>
               <p>"Indeed I sha'n't!" replied Kitty in a strange voice. "He is no company of mine;
                  and I don't want him even to look into my room. I'd never sleep there again if he
                  did once!"</p>
               <p>"Well, then, we can make a bed for Karl on the floor, and Mr. Brown can have his
                  bed," said Dora quietly, seeing nothing deeper in Kitty's refusal than a little
                  impulse of perversity.</p>
               <p>Kitty made no reply; and Dora, groping her way toward where she stood, put an arm
                  about her waist, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Come, Kitty, come down with me. You're tired, I know; and it is too bad you have
                  so much to do. To-morrow I will stay at home and help you. Karl can take a
                  holiday, and show Mr. Brown over the farm."</p>
               <p>"What nonsense! I don't do any thing to hurt; and it would be pretty well for you
                  to send Mr. Brown off with Karl, when he came here on purpose to see you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, he didn't! He came to see us all; and he asked where you were just now,
                  when we came in."</p>
               <p>"And that was why you came to look for me; wasn't it?" asked Kitty
                  suspiciously.</p>
               <p>"Not wholly. I had been thinking of it for some minutes."</p>
               <p>"But couldn't bear to leave long enough," suggested Kitty; adding, however, "Well,
                  I'll come. I suppose it is no more than polite, as long as he's company."</p>
               <p>"Of course it isn't; and you know Mr. Brown is very ceremonious," said Dora, so
                  archly, that Kitty paused in smoothing her hair to say,—</p>
               <p>"Now, if you're going to make fun of me, Dora"—</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'm not!—not a bit of it. There, now, you're nice enough for any thing."</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5676-00000144"/>
               <p>In the kitchen, besides Mr. Brown and Karl, the girls found Mr. and Mrs. Ross;
                  Mehitable demurely seated in a corner, and knitting a long woollen stocking; while
                  Seth, under the skilful management of Mr. Brown, was giving quite an interesting
                  description of life in a Maine logging-camp.</p>
               <p>"Do you ever have any trouble from wild beasts in that region?" asked the
                  chaplain.</p>
               <p>"Waal, some. There's lots of b'ar about by spells; and once't in a while a painter
                  or a wild-cat—wolverines, some calls 'em out here."</p>
               <p>"Did you ever meet one yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Which on 'em?"</p>
               <p>"Either. Bears, for instance."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. I've took b'ar ever since I wor old enough to set a trap."</p>
               <p>"Did you ever have any trouble with one?"</p>
               <p>"Waal, I don' know as I did. They was mostly pooty 'commodatin'," said Seth,
                  drawing the back of his brown hand across his mouth to hide a self-complacent grin
                  at the recollection of his own exploits.</p>
               <p>"Tell Mr. Brown 'bout the painter and Uncle 'Siah's Harnah," suggested Mehitable
                  in a low voice; and as Seth only stirred in his chair, and looked rather
                  reprovingly at his wife, the guest added,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Ross, tell us that, by all means."</p>
               <p>"Ho! 'twa'n't much of a story; only the woman thinks consid'able about it, 'cause
                  it wor a cousin of ourn that wor took off."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! and what were the circumstances?" politely insisted Mr. Brown. So Seth,
                  tilting his chair upon its hind-legs, and crossing his own, stuck his chin into
                  the air; fixed his eyes upon the ceiling, and began, in the inimitable nasal
                  whining voice of a Down-East Yankee, the story narrated in the following

                  have to be mighty car'ful, or some o' the young ones would tumble over the
                  jumping-off-place, we'd got so nigh. But Uncle 'Siah went right along, and took up
                  land furder on, whar there wa'n't nothing but hemlock-trees and chipmunks for
                  company, and no passing to keep the women-folks running to the winders. Thar was a
                  good road cut through the woods, and there was the river run within a
                  stone's-throw of both houses: so, one way and another, we got back'ards and
                  for'ards consid'able often, 'specially when the young folks begun to grow up.</p>
               <p>"Harnah wor Uncle 'Siah's second gal, and just as pooty as a picter. She looked
                  suthin' like Dolcy, Dora's little adopted darter, you know: but she wor alluz
                  a-larfin', and gitting off her jokes; and had a sort of a wicked look by spells,
                  enough to make a feller's flesh creep on his bones."</p>
               <p>"Lor', that's enough o' Harnah! She wa'n't so drefful different from other folks.
                  Git along to the story part on't," interrupted Mehitable, clicking her
                  knitting-needles energetically.</p>
               <p>Seth looked at her a little indignantly for a moment, and then burst into a loud
                  laugh,—</p>
               <p>"Lor'! I'd clear forgot how it used ter spite Hit to hear me praise up Harnah. You
                  see, sir, Mehitabul wor a sort o' cousin o' my mother's, and so come to live long
                  of us when her father died: but she never cottoned to Harnah very strong when she
                  see how well I liked her; though, now she's got me for her own man, I'd
                  think"—</p>
               <p>"But the panther, Mr. Ross," interposed Dora, who saw, with womanly sympathy, the
                  flush of mortification upon Mehitable's face: "do tell us about the panther."</p>
               <p>"Yes: I b'lieve my idees was kind o' wandering from the pint; but that's nothing
                  strange, if you knowed what an out-an-outer that gal was. Well, well, 'tain't no
                  use a-crying over spilt milk, and by-gones may as well be stay-gones.</p>
               <p>"Sam Hedge, he was my uncle's hired man, and a plaguy smart feller too;
                  good-looking, merry as a grig, a live Yankee for faculty, and pretty forehanded
                  too, though he hadn't set up for himself then. I more than suspicioned he'd ruther
                  live with Uncle 'Siah, and see Harnah from<pb n="290-291"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000146"/> morning to night, than go off and take up land for
                  himself; or maybe he didn't feel as if he'd the peth to take right hold of new
                  land all alone. Anyway, there he wor, and there he stuck, right squar in my way,
                  do as much as I might to git him out on't.</p>
               <p>"Of course, you onderstand about being in my way means all along o' Harnah. We was
                  both sweet on her, and no mistake; though nary one on us, nor, I believe, the gal
                  herself, could ha' told which one she favored.</p>
               <p>"Waal, to skip over all the rest (though there's the stuff for half a dozen
                  stories in it), I'll come to one night when I'd been up to Uncle 'Siah's, and
                  Harnah and Sam had come down to the crick to see me off; for I'd come in my boat.
                  I felt kind o' savage; for Harnah had been mighty pooty with me all that evening;
                  and I knew Sam had come down to the boat a purpose to go back to the house with
                  her, and, 'fore they was half-way, she'd come right round, and be just as clever
                  to him as she'd been before to me."</p>
               <p>"If you knew your cousin to be such a terrible little flirt as that, I shouldn't
                  think you would have cared so much about her, Seth," suggested Karl, laughing.</p>
               <p>"No more shouldn't I, cap'n," replied Seth ruefully. "But somehow I couldn't help
                  it. I'd think it over nights, and say to myself, 'You darned fool! don't you see
                  the gal's a-playing one of you off agin t'other, and maybe don't care a pin for
                  neither? Get shet of her once for all, and be a man; can't ye?' And then I'd find
                  I couldn't; and so it went till we come to that night, and stood there on the edge
                  of the crick,—two on us ready to clinch and fight till one cried enough, and
                  t'other a-laughing at us both.</p>
               <p>"So, all to once, Harnah says, says she,—</p>
               <p>"'I do believe them harebells are blowed out by this time. Ain't they, boys?'</p>
               <p>"'You and I'll go to-morrow and see, anyway,' says Sam, speaking up quick, 'fore I
                  got the chance.</p>
               <p>"'<emph>I'm</emph> a-going to see; and, if Harnah'll come too, all the better,'
                  says I, as pleasant as a bear with a sore head.</p>
               <p>"'Two's company, and three's a crowd; so you'd better stop to home, Seth,' says
                  Sam.</p>
               <p>"'Two's company, that's Harnah and me; and three's a crowd, that's you: so, ef you
                  don't like crowding nor being crowded, you'd better stop to home yourself,' says
                  I.</p>
               <p>"'I believe I spoke first, Seth Ross,' says Sam, pretty savage at last.</p>
               <p>"'That don't make no difference, as I know on. Harnah<pb n="292-293"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000147"/> was my cousin long afore you was her father's hired
                  man; and that puts me in mind you hain't asked leave yet. Maybe the old man won't
                  let you go. What you going to do then?' asked I, dreadful kind of sneering; for I
                  felt mad.</p>
               <p>"Sam he didn't say nothing; but he drew back, and doubled up his fists. I caught
                  the glint of his eye in the moonlight, and my darnder riz.</p>
               <p>"'Come on,' says I; 'I'm ready for you; and we'll fight it out like men. The
                  feller that's licked shall give up once for all.'</p>
               <p>"But 'fore Sam could speak, or I could hit out as I wanted ter, Harnah come right
                  in between us. I swow ef that gal didn't look harnsome! Her eyes was wide open,
                  and shining just like blue steel in the moonlight. Her cheeks and lips was white;
                  and seemed to me the very curls of her hair shot out sparks, she was so mad.</p>
               <p>"'You'd better stop while there's time,' says she, still and cold. 'If you strike
                  one another, or if you ever fight, and I the cause, I swear to God I never will
                  speak a civil word to either one of you again as long as I live. So now you
                  know.</p>
               <p>"'As for the harebells, you sha'n't neither one of you go for 'em. Ef I want
                  harebells, there's them that can get 'em for me, and not make so much fuss about
                  it neither.'</p>
               <p>"She turned, and stepped off toward the house as if she'd got steel springs in the
                  soles of her feet.</p>
               <p>"Sam and I eyed each other. It seemed as if Harnah felt that look; for she turned
                  all of a sudden, and come back.</p>
               <p>"'Sam,' says she, p'inting up to the house, 'go home; and don't you speak to me
                  again to-night. Seth, get into your boat, and push her off. You needn't come up
                  to-morrow night.'</p>
               <p>"We sort o' looked at one another and at her, and then meeched off the way she
                  told us, for all the world like two dogs that's got a licking, and been sent home
                  'fore the hunt was done.</p>
               <p>"I didn't sleep a great deal that night. Fact is, I was turning over in my own
                  mind what Harnah had said about them as would git harebells for her, and not make
                  so much fuss about it neither.</p>
               <p>"'I swow,' says I, 'I'd like to clinch that feller, whoever he may be, and not
                  have Harnah nigh enough to interfere.' Then I rec'lected a Cap'n Harris, a British
                  officer, that come down from Canady the summer before, hunting and<pb n="294-295"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000148"/> fishing, and had stopped a week or more at Uncle
                  'Siah's, mostly for the sake of seeing Harnah, as I thought then, and do now. Ever
                  since, when Harnah didn't know how else to plague Sam and me, she'd set up to talk
                  about 'real gentlemen,' and 'folks that knowed manners,' and all sech stuff. Then
                  she'd pretend she'd got a letter from Cap'n Harris, and that he was coming agin,
                  and all that. So now I got it in my head that Cap'n Harris was coming, and that
                  she meant he'd get the harebells.</p>
               <p>"'But I'll bet he won't, without a fight, anyway,' says I, clinching up my fist;
                  and then I went to sleep quite comf'table.</p>
               <p>"Now, there wa'n't but one place, as I knew of, where harebells was to be found;
                  and Harnah had showed me that place herself the summer afore, and I had picked the
                  flowers for her. So I made up my mind to go next day and see if they was in blow;
                  and, if they was, to get a bunch anyway, and take the resk of giving 'em to Harnah
                  arterwards.</p>
               <p>"I couldn't git away in the morning nohow; for Hitty seemed to know it was
                  something about Harnah that was calling me, and contrived all sorts of business to
                  keep me to hum: but, after dinner, I jist took my hat, and cleared out afore she
                  knowed it, and, by the time she missed me, was half a mile up the river.</p>
               <p>"'Twas a pooty day as ever you see; and as I rowed along, listening to the water
                  running by the boat, and the wind rustling in the trees, I began to feel real sort
                  of good, and didn't care half so much about Sam or the British cap'n as I did when
                  I started. When I come to the landing at Uncle 'Siah's, I never stopped, though I
                  looked with all my eyes for any signs of Harnah; but couldn't see no one but Sam
                  going out to the cornfield, with a hoe on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"'Good for you, Sam,' says I to myself. 'Hard work's dreadful wholesome for
                  love-sickness.' So I rowed along as merry as a cricket, and pretty soon tied up my
                  boat, and struck off into the woods. It was consid'able of a walk; and I strolled
                  along easy till I came to the place whar the harebells growed, 'bout a mile and a
                  half from the river. This was a high clift, covered with brush and trees on one
                  side, and on the other falling sheer down to a little deep valley, with another
                  clift rising opposite. These clifts joined each other at the two ends of the
                  valley: so there was no getting into it anyway but down the faces of 'em, and that
                  was as much as a man's neck was worth; but, fur's I know, no man had ever wanted
                  to, nor ever tried to, till that day.</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5676-00000149"/>
               <p>"The harebells growed on the very edge of the fust clift, and a little way down
                  the face of it, and looked mighty pooty a-floating in the wind. Harnah, who was
                  kind of romantic, said they was the plume in the old clift's hat; and she called
                  the place the Lovers' Rock, 'case, she said, the two clifts seemed taking hold of
                  hands, and jist going to kiss."</p>
               <p>"That sounds like Harnah, anyway," muttered Mehitable contemptuously.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it's more uv an idee than you'd 'a been likely to git off, ain't it, Hit?"
                  asked Seth with a malicious grin, and winking at the company.</p>
               <p>But Mehitable preserving a prudent silence, and only showing her feelings by an
                  accelerated movement of her knitting-needles, her husband elevated his eyes again
                  to the ceiling, recrossed his legs, and continued:—</p>
               <p>"I scrambled up the back of the clift easy enough; and, sure enough, there was the
                  posies, all in blow, and tossing their heads at me as if they knowed how pooty
                  they was, and dared me not to say so. Somehow they made me think of Harnah; and I
                  spoke right out,—</p>
               <p>"'Yes, I know you be; and I hain't never said you ain't as pooty a cretur as walks
                  the airth: but I wish you wan't so awful changeable.'</p>
               <p>"Then I laffed right out, to think I was talking to a lot of flowers same as if
                  they was a gal; and, when I done laffin', I went down on my knees, and begun to
                  pick 'em. But I hadn't more than got the first fist-ful when I heerd a groan, a
                  sort uv a faint holler groan, that sounded as if it come right out uv the ground
                  underneath me. I dropped the flowers, and riz right up on eend. My ha'r riz too;
                  for I was scaart, I tell you. 'But,' thinks I, ''twon't do to run away the fust
                  lick:' so I held on, and pooty soon it come agin. This time I listened sharp, and
                  had my wits about me; so that, when it wor through, I clim' right up to the top uv
                  the ledge, and looked down into the valley, hollerin'—</p>
               <p>"'Who be you? Is any one thar?'</p>
               <p>"A voice answered, faint and weak; but what it said, or whar it was, I couldn't
                  for the life of me tell.</p>
               <p>"So I hollered agin,—</p>
               <p>"'Whar be you, stranger? Holler as loud as you kin!'</p>
               <p>"The voice answered back; and I heerd my own name, and, as I thought, in a voice
                  that turned me as sick and weak as a gal.</p>
               <p>"It was Harnah's voice; and my first idee was that she wor dead, and wor ha'nting
                  me.</p>
               <p>"'Harnah!' says I, soft and low, 'is it you?'</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5676-00000150"/>
               <p>"There wa'n't no answer, but another groan, and along of it a curious kind of
                  noise, like a lot of cats all growling together. I knowed that noise; and, afore
                  it eended, I knowed whar it come from. And, all to once, the hull story come to
                  me: Harnah was down thar in a painter's den; and the kittens was a-growling round
                  her. The old ones must be away, or one of 'em would 'a been out to see to me afore
                  this.</p>
               <p>"I hadn't the fust thing in the way of a we'pon with me; but there was plenty of
                  stones down in the hollow, and I cut a good oak-sapling with my jack-knife. Then I
                  sot myself to scramble down the face of the clift; and, I tell you, I sweat before
                  I got to the bottom. Ef it hadn't been for Harnah, I couldn't 'a done it; but,
                  somehow or 'nother, I reached the bottom, and looked about me. Sure enough, close
                  to my feet was the mouth of a cave, running right in under the ledge, though not
                  more than three foot high. I knelt down and peeked in, calling,—</p>
               <p>"'Harnah, be you thar?'</p>
               <p>"'Seth, is it you?' asked a voice very faint.</p>
               <p>"'Yes, my dear, it is,' says I, 'and bound to get you out uv this scrape about the
                  quickest. What's a-keeping you in there?'</p>
               <p>"'My leg is broke, and the horrid creature is lying on my feet!' says Harnah.</p>
               <p>"I didn't wait for no more questions, but crawled inter the hole. A dozen feet
                  from the mouth, I come to a snarl of fur, and glary eyes, and snapping teeth, and
                  savage growls, that I finally made out to be a couple of painter-kittens, not
                  more'n a few days old, but savage enough for a hundred. They was snuggled close up
                  to something: what it was I couldn't at fust make out in the darkness; but putty
                  soon I see that it was a full-grown painter, lying stretched out at length. I
                  started back, with all the blood in me pricking at my fingers' ends with the scare
                  I'd got; but Harnah's voice from beyond says,—</p>
               <p>"Don't be frightened at the old panther. She's dead. They fought, and one ran
                  away; and this one is dead.'</p>
               <p>"And is she a-lying on your feet, did you say? It's so dark in here, I can't see
                  the fust thing,' says I, feeling round for the critter's head, and gitting my paws
                  tore by the young ones, who, I must say for 'em, was mighty handy with their claws
                  for their age. So says I,—</p>
               <p>"'Well, fust thing, I'll get red o' these little devils; and then I'll drag out
                  the karkiss, and see to you, my poor gal.'</p>
               <p>"So I clinched the fust one by the throat, and, when he<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000151"/> hung like a rag, pitched him out, and grappled
                  t'other; but he was a case, I tell you. Fight!—you'd ought ter have seen him!—and
                  scratch and bite, and spit and yowl, till the whole woods rung with his uproar. I
                  mastered him finally; but he'd done his work, and come nigh beating me even arter
                  he was dead, as ye shall hear.</p>
               <p>"When the kittens was out of the way, I clinched the karkiss uv the old painter,
                  and dragged it to'rst the mouth uv the cave. It wor hard work; and, when I'd got
                  part way, I left it lying, and squeezed by (for it most filled up the passage),
                  and went to see how bad Harnah might be hurt; for, when I spoke to her last, she
                  hadn't made no reply. Leaning over her, I felt round for her face, and had jist
                  touched her cold cheek, and called to her to know if she was alive, when I heerd
                  jist over my head the awfulest roar that ever come out uv a creter's throat; and
                  so loud, that it echoed through and through the cave enough to deaf you. The
                  minute I heerd it, I knew what was tew pay, and give up for lost. It wor the man
                  o' the house come home in a hurry to see what them squalls uv the dying kittens
                  meant; and that's how I said they come nigh beating me even arter they was
                  dead.</p>
               <p>"Now, mister, what would you say a man had ought to have done in such a fix as
                  that?—run, or stay? Mind ye, I hadn't the fust thing in shape uv a we'pon, nor
                  couldn't get hold even uv my stick, nor the stones outside; and what could a
                  feller do with his naked fists, shet up in a hole with a wild-cat?"</p>
               <p>"It was a trying situation; but I don't believe you ran away," said Mr. Brown
                  good-humoredly.</p>
               <p>"Yer bet your life on that, stranger," replied Seth with emphasis. "I hadn't no
                  idee on't; though the only other chance seemed to be to jump down the critter's
                  throat, and choke him, so's ter spile his stomach for Harnah.</p>
               <p>"I looked to the mouth uv the cave, and thought, 'He won't get by that karkiss
                  very easy;' and then, all of a sudden, the strangest idee you ever heerd come
                  acrost me, and I jumped as though I'd been shot. It wor to play off one of the
                  critters agin the other, and keep the old painter out uv his den with the karkiss
                  of his mate.</p>
               <p>"It wor a curus idee, now, worn't it; but they say a drownding man'll clinch to a
                  straw, and this wor worth the trying to a feller in as tight a place as I. So I
                  tumbled the old lady over as well as I could, and got her wedged inter the
                  narrerest part uv the road, with her back rounded out, and her paws in, so's't I
                  should have a better chance for hanging<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC5676-00000152"/>
                  ing on than the old feller outside 'ud have for pulling. Then, with my jack-knife,
                  I cut a slit in one of the fore-legs and one of the hind, to put my hands inter;
                  and then I held on.</p>
               <p>"'Twa'n't but a minute arter I got fixed 'fore he wor down upon me, yelling and
                  squalling enough ter make a man's blood run cold. They call 'em Injin Devils down
                  our way; and I guess there ain't no kind uv devils make a wuss-soundin' noise. I
                  jist shut my eyes, and lay low; for when I knowed that furce, wild creter wor
                  within two foot uv me, and nothing ter keep him off but a karkiss that he'd claw
                  ter pieces in ten minutes, I kinder wondered how I'd been sich a plaguy fool as to
                  think uv the plan, and ter feel so pleased with it.</p>
               <p>"And didn't yer never mind, sir, when you've been laying out for some great pull,
                  you feel as if you'd got fixed fustrate, and was sure ter win, till the minute
                  comes; and then, all ter once, your gitting-ready seems no account somehow, and
                  you feel downright shamed uv what, a minute before, made you so chirk?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is human nature, Seth; but it is well to remember that cool precaution
                  is worth more than excitement, after all," said Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I suppose so now; but I didn't then. It only seemed to me as ef I was a
                  darned fool, though I couldn't hev said what I'd ought to hev done different ef
                  I'd been ever so wise. Well, the critter come, and he stuck his head in, snuffing
                  and smelling for a minute; and then reached in one paw, jest as softly as you've
                  seed a pussy-cat feeling uv a ball uv yarn on the floor. Then he growled; for
                  either he'd smelt or he'd seed me a-peekin' over the old woman's corpse at him.
                  Hokey! didn't I wish I'd a good gun handy jis' then, with sech a splendid chance
                  to sight it! But I hadn't; and thar was the critter, growling and tearing away at
                  the karkiss like mad: fer he'd pooty much made up his mind by this time what sort
                  o' game lay behind it, and he was bound to be at it. Any one would 'a thought his
                  nateral feelings would 'a stood in the way some, seein' as 'twor his own wife he
                  wor clapper-clawin' at sich a rate; but they didn't seem to a bit: and, I tell
                  you, he made the fur fly 'thout con-sideration. The blood streamed down inter my
                  face, and the smell of that and the flesh choked me. My arms wor straightened
                  clean out with holding on; and sometimes I could jest see the green eyes o' the
                  painter, an' feel his hot breath, as he opened his jaws to hiss and spit at me
                  jis' like a big cat. I felt the eend uv all things wor at<pb n="304-305"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000153"/> hand; an', shettin' my eyes, I tried hard ter say a
                  prayer, or somethin' good an' fittin'. I couldn't think o' none, hows'ever: so I
                  jis' turned raound, and sez, 'Harnah! good-by, Harnah!' an' felt most as if I'd
                  prayed; though she, poor gal! wor clean swownded away, and never heerd a word
                  on't.</p>
               <p>"Jes' then, when my thoughts wor so took up that I'd act'ally most forgot where I
                  wor, and jes' held on to the critter kind o' mechanical-like, I heerd a shot, and
                  then another. The painter heerd 'em too, an' more than heerd 'em, I reckon; for,
                  with a growl an' a roar that made me scringe, he let go the karkiss, an' backed
                  hisself out o' the hole 'thout never sayin good-by to me nor to the old lady.</p>
               <p>"Next minute I heerd another shot, and then another; and then sech horrid groans
                  and screams, mixed up with growls and hisses from the painter, that I knew he wor
                  hit hard, an' like to die; and, ef I should say I wor sorry, it 'ud be a lie. Then
                  I heerd feet climbing and scrambling down the rocks; and next I heerd a v'ice
                  calling, kind o' frightened-like,—</p>
               <p>"'Be you raound here, Harnah, or Seth?'</p>
               <p>"'Yes, we be,' says I, waking up all uv a sudden; for I'd lay sort o' stupid till
                  then: but now I wor wide enough awake, and soon made Sam understand where we was,
                  and what was to be done. He didn't say much, but worked away like a good feller,
                  till he got out, fust the mauled karkiss o' the painter, with the flesh all
                  hanging from it in strips; then me, covered with blood, and looking wuss than a
                  dead man, I expect; and finally Harnah, jes' coming to after her dead faint.</p>
               <p>"We must git her out o' this horrid den 'fore she knows whar she is, or it'll
                  skeer her to death,' says I, as soon as I could speak. 'But how'll we do it?'</p>
               <p>"'You look as if you b'longed here; so I reckon you'd better stop behind, and I'll
                  git Harnah out by myself,' says Sam, laffin' in a kind o' hard way.</p>
               <p>"I didn't say nothing; but I thought I wouldn't 'a took that time to laff at a
                  feller, nor yet to show a spite agin him, if I'd been Sam, and he me.</p>
               <p>"It's more nor I could do to justly tell you how we ever got that gal up them
                  rocks. I expect it wor more the hand o' God, so to speak, than us that did it.
                  Fust place, we tied our handkerchers raound her waist, fer a hold; and then Sam
                  went ahead, pulling her after him, and I sort o' helped behind, and clim' along as
                  well's I could; and bimby we got up, and laid Harnah down to rest among the
                  harebells. When she got a little smarter, she told us how<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000154"/> she thought she'd come and git 'em fer herself, and
                  then pertend some one had given 'em to her, jest so's to plague us, and see what
                  we'd say. Then, whilst she was a-picking of 'em, she heerd a painter cry right
                  clost to her, and was so scared, she sot out to run, and, fust she knew, was over
                  the edge of the clift, and rolling down the face on't. When she got to the bottom,
                  her leg was broke, and she couldn't stir; and up to the top o' the rocks she see
                  the painter's head, with his green eyeballs a-glaring down at her, and his ears
                  laid back, ready for a spring. What with the pain, and what with the scare, I
                  expect the poor gal fainted. Anyways, the next thing she knowed was finding
                  herself in the cave with the two painter-kittens playing round her, and the old
                  one lying close to, moving his tail from side to side, and yawning till she could
                  see all his white teeth and great red throat. Ef she wor scart afore, she didn't
                  feel no better now, you'd better believe. But Harnah was a stout-hearted gal, with
                  all her delicate ways; and she never stirred, no made a sound, only lay still, and
                  fixed her eyes as stiddy as she could on those uv the great brute beside her.
                  Pooty soon she see that he wor a-looking at her; and pooty soon he began to make a
                  purring sort of noise, like 'bout forty big tomcats tied up in one bag. Then
                  Harnah spoke to him, like as she'd have coaxed a dog, and, arter a while, began to
                  play with the cubs a little. One way and another, they'd got to be 'mazin' good
                  friends all raound, when a cry was heerd outside; and the old man and the little
                  ones pricked up their ears, and yowled in answer. It wor the old woman coming
                  home, sure enough; and the minute she poked her snout inter the den, and see what
                  company her man had got while she wor gone, the trouble begun. Harnah, naterally,
                  wor too much skeered to see justly what went on: but there were a big fight
                  somehow; and she got a notion that the she-painter wanted to fall afoul uv her,
                  and that he wouldn't let her; and, like other married folks, from words they come
                  to blows; and the upshot uv the hull was, that the old lady got the wust on't, and
                  lay dead on the field uv action.</p>
               <p>"Whether the husband felt bad, or whether he wanted sunthin' to eat, or whether he
                  had an engagement with another lady, I couldn't say; but, the minute he'd given
                  the finishing blow to his wife, he cleared out, and didn't come back till the cubs
                  called him to see to me.</p>
               <p>"Well, we got Harnah home somehow; and next day we come again, and skun the old
                  tiger and the cubs; and I got a hull heap o' harebells. I was bound, that, after
                  all the fuss, Harnah shouldn't lose her harebells; and she didn't."</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5676-00000155"/>
               <p>Seth was silent; and, tilting his chair a little farther back, crossed his hands
                  above his chest, and began to whistle softly. The company looked at him
                  inquiringly; and, after a pause, Karl asked,—</p>
               <p>"Well, what next, Seth?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, cap'n: that's all; except I didn't tell how Sam see me going up the
                  river, and suspicioned I wor a going to meet Harnah, and so dropped all, and
                  followed on. What he brought his gun fer, I didn't never ask him."</p>
               <p>"But Hannah—what became of her?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! she was kind o' peeked a while, with her broken leg; but, arter that, she was
                  as well as ever."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but how did her love-affairs terminate?" persisted Karl.</p>
               <p>"Waal, she married Sam Hedge the next fall; and I guess their love-affairs turned
                  out like other folkses a good deal,—lots o' 'lasses at fust, and, arter a while,
                  lots o' vinegar: that's the way o' married life."</p>
               <p>In delivering this sentiment, Seth bestowed a sidelong glance upon Mehitable, far
                  more merry than sincere in its expression; but she, tranquilly pursuing her
                  knitting, let fall her retort, as if she had not perceived the sarcasm.</p>
               <p>"Oh, waal!" said she, "I don't know as I've any call to find fault with merried
                  life. Seth's made as good a husband as a gal has a right to expect that takes a
                  feller out o' pity 'cause he's been mittened by another gal."</p>
               <p>The laugh remained upon the feminine side of the argument, and the party merrily
                  separated for the night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A GLEAM OF DAWN.</head>
               <p>ONCE more a summer sunset at the old farm-house among the Berkshire Hills, where,
                  for a hundred years, successive generations of Windsors had been born and bred;
                  once more we see the level rays glance from the diamond-paned, dairy casement,
                  left ajar to admit the fresh evening air; once more the airy banners of eglantine
                  and maiden's-bower float against the clear blue sky; once more we tread in fancy
                  the green velvet of the turf, creeping over the very edge of the irregular
                  door-stone, worn smooth by feet that long since have travelled beyond earthly
                  limits, and now tread celestial fields and sunny slopes of Paradise. Far across
                  the meadow lies the shadow of the old house,—a strange, fantastic suggestion of a
                  dwellings vague and enticing as the gray turrets of the Castle of St. John, which,
                  as the legend says, are to be shaped at twilight from the crags and ravines of the
                  lonely mountains, but vanish in the daylight. And beside it, not vague, but clear
                  and sharp, lay the shadow of the old well-sweep, like a giant finger, pointing,
                  always pointing, now to the east, whence cometh light and hope, and the promise of
                  another day; and anon due west, as showing to the sad eyes that watched it the
                  road to joy and comfort.</p>
               <p>Within the house, much was changed. The floors were covered with matting, the
                  walls with delicate paper-hangings; the old furniture replaced with Indian couches
                  and arm-chairs, whose shape and material suggested luxurious ease and coolness. In
                  the chamber that had been Dora's, was wrought, perhaps, the greatest change of
                  all; for to the rugged simplicity, and, so to speak, severity, of the young girl's
                  surroundings, had succeeded the luxury, the exquisite refinement, essential to the
                  comfort of a woman born and bred in the innermost sanctuary of modern
                  civilization. The martial relics of Dora's camp-life had disappeared from the
                  walls, no longer simply whitewashed, but covered with a pearl-gray paper, over
                  which trailed in graceful curves a mimic ivy-vine, colored like nature. Upon this
                  hung a few choice pictures,—proof-engravings of Correggio's Cherubs; a Christ
                  blessing Little Children; a Madonna, with sad, soft eyes resting upon the Holy
                  Child, whose fixed gaze seemed to read his own sublime destiny; and a Babes in the
                  Wood.</p>
               <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC5676-00000157"/>
               <p>Over the fireplace, the rude sketch of the deformed negro was replaced by an
                  exquisite painting, representing a little girl,—her sweet face framed in a shower
                  of golden ringlets, her blue eyes fixed with a sort of wistful tenderness upon the
                  beholder; this expression repeating itself in the lines of the curving mouth. The
                  dress was carefully copied from that worn by 'Toinette Legrange upon the day she
                  was lost; and the picture had been painted, soon after her disappearance, by an
                  artist friend of the family, who had so often admired the beautiful child, that he
                  found it easy to reproduce her face upon canvas; although his own knowledge of the
                  circumstances, and perhaps the haunting presence of the sad eyes of the mother, as
                  she asked, "Oh! can you give me even a picture of her?" had tinged the whole
                  composition with a pathos not intended by the artist, but indescribably touching
                  to the spectator.</p>
               <p>Between the windows, in place of Dora's simple pine table, with its white drapery,
                  its few plain books, and little work-box, stood a toilet-table, covered with the
                  luxurious necessities of an elegant woman's wardrobe. The dressing-case, the
                  jewel-box, the perfume-bottles; the velvet-lined and delicately-scented <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">mouchoir</foreign> and glove boxes; the varied trifles, so idle
                  in detail, so essential to the whole,—all were there, and all evidently in
                  constant use.</p>
               <p>Nor let us too harshly judge the mode of life, differ though it may from our own,
                  which regards these superfluities as essential, and can hardly less dispense with
                  them than with its daily bread. The violet, the anemone, the May-flower, a hundred
                  sweet and hardy blossoms, thrive amid the chills and storms of early spring in the
                  most exposed situations. But are not the exquisite tea-rose, the fragile
                  garden-lily, or the cereus, that dies after one sweet night of perfumed beauty, as
                  true to their nature and to God's law? Did not the same hand form the sparrow, who
                  scatters the late snow from his wings, and gayly pecks the crumbs from our
                  doorstep, and the humming-bird, who waits for gorgeous summer noons to come and
                  sip the honey from our jessamine?</p>
               <p>So let us, if we will, love Dora in the Spartan simplicity of her soldierly
                  adornments, and none the less love and cherish the woman who now lies upon the
                  very spot, where, but a year ago, lay little Sunshine, wavering between this life
                  and a better. For some reason unknown to herself, Mrs. Legrange had, from the
                  first, felt a strong affection for this chamber, haunted, though she knew it not,
                  by the presence of the beloved child; and she had taken much pleasure in its
                  adornment; though, now that all was done, she rarely noticed the beautiful
                  articles collected about her, liking best<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC5676-00000158"
                  /> of all to lie in dreamy revery, recalling, day after day, with the minute
                  fondness of a woman's memory, the looks, the gestures, the careless words, the
                  pretty, graceful ways, the artless fascinations, of her whom now she rarely named,
                  holding her memory as something too sacred for common speech, too far withdrawn
                  into her own heart to be lightly brought to the surface.</p>
               <p>Thus lying in the twilight of this evening, dreamily watching the long white
                  curtains as they filled with the night-air and floated out into the room like the
                  shadowy sails of a bark anchored in some Dreamland bay, and never guessing whose
                  eyes had watched their waving but one short year before, when 'Toinette was first
                  laid in Dora's little bed, Mrs. Legrange heard her husband coming up the stairs,
                  and rose to receive him, with a strange fluttering at her heart,—a sort of nervous
                  hope and terror all in one, as if she had known him the bearer of great news, but
                  could not yet determine its tenor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Legrange entered, holding a letter in his hand, and glanced tenderly, but with
                  some surprise, at his wife, who stood with one hand pressing the white folds of
                  her muslin wrapper convulsively to her bosom, the other outstretched toward him, a
                  sudden hectic burning in her cheeks, and her eyes bright with feverish light.</p>
               <p>"Fanny! what is it?" exclaimed the husband, pausing upon the threshold.</p>
               <p>"That letter—you have some news! O Paul, you have news of"—</p>
               <p>Her voice died in a breathless flutter; and Mr. Legrange, coming hastily to her
                  side, drew her to a seat, saying tenderly,—</p>
               <p>"No, darling, no news of her,—not yet, at least. What made you fancy it? This is
                  only a letter from your <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégé</foreign> at Antioch
                  College: at least, I suppose so from the postmark. Do you care to read it
                  now?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange hid her face upon her husband's breast, trembling nervously.</p>
               <p>"O Paul! when I heard you coming up the stairs, such a feeling came over me! I
                  seemed to feel some great revelation approaching. I was sure it was news of her.
                  Paul, Paul, I cannot bear it; I cannot live! My heart is broken; but it will not
                  die, and let me rest. O my God! how long?"</p>
               <p>"Hush, dearest, hush! Your wild words are to me worse than the grief we both
                  suffer so keenly. But, my wife, have we not each other? and would you kill me by
                  your own despair? Will God be pleased, that, because he<pb n="316-317"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000159"/> has taken away our Sunshine, we refuse all other
                  blessings, and disdain all other ties and obligations? Fanny, dearest, is it not
                  an earnest duty with you to strive for strength?"</p>
               <p>But the mother only moaned impatiently,—</p>
               <p>"O Paul! do not try, do not talk: it is useless. When you let fall that crystal
                  vinaigrette this morning, did you tell it that its duty was to be whole, and
                  filled with perfume again? Do you tell those flowers that it is their duty to be
                  fresh and sweet as they were yesterday? or, if you did, would they heed you?"</p>
               <p>"No, darling; for they have neither mind nor soul," suggested the husband
                  significantly.</p>
               <p>"And mine are swallowed up in the sorrow that has swallowed all else. O Paul!
                  forgive me, and ask God to forgive me; but I cannot, I never can, become resigned.
                  I cannot live; I cannot wish or try to live. A little while, and I shall see
                  her."</p>
               <p>She spoke the last words softly, as to her own heart; and over her face passed
                  such a look of solemn joy, such yearning tenderness, mingled with an infinite
                  pathos, that the stronger and less sensitive male organization stood awed and
                  subdued before it.</p>
               <p>"Her love and grief are deeper than any words of mine can reach," thought the
                  husband, and, so, tenderly soothed her head upon his breast, and said no more for
                  several minutes, until, to his surprise, it was lifted, and the pale face looked
                  into his with the pensive calmness under which it habitually hid its more intimate
                  expressions.</p>
               <p>"From whom did you say the letter came, Paul?" asked Mrs. Legrange.</p>
               <p>"From Theodore Ginniss, I believe. Will you read it now?" asked her husband, in
                  some surprise at the sudden transition: for no man ever thoroughly comprehends a
                  woman, no woman a man; and so is the distinctive temperament of the sexes
                  preserved.</p>
               <p>"Yes: I told him to write to me once in every month, and he is very punctual."</p>
               <p>She opened the letter, and read aloud:—</p>

                              <salute>"DEAR MRS. LEGRANGE,—</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>"Since writing to you last month, I have been going on with my studies
                              under the Rev. Mr. Brown, as I then mentioned. I do not find that it
                              hurts me to study in the hot weather at all; and I have enjoyed my
                              vacation better this way than if I had been idle.</p>
                           <p>"Part of the month, however, Mr. Brown has been away on a visit to
                              some friends in Iowa; and he says so much<pb n="318-319"
                                 xml:id="VAC5676-00000160"/> about the prairies, and the great
                              rivers, and the wild life out there, that I think I should like to
                              take the two remaining weeks of the vacation, and go and see them, if
                              you have no objection. I have a great plenty of money from my last
                              quarter's allowance, as I have only needed to spend a dollar and
                              forty-five cents. Mr. Brown thinks I should come back fresher to my
                              studies for a little rest; though I do not feel the need of it, and am
                              glad of every day's new chance of learning.</p>
                           <p>"I hope you will excuse me, Mrs. Legrange, if it is too bold for me to
                              say, but I do wish you could talk with Mr. Brown a little; he is so
                              high in all his ideas, and seems to feel so strong about all the
                              troubles of this world, and puts what a man ought to live for so much
                              above the way he has to live!</p>
                           <p>"I took the liberty of talking with him about you, and about the great
                              trouble I had helped to bring upon you; and what he said was
                              first-rate, though I cannot tell it again. I felt ever so much better
                              about my own doing wrong, and I could not help wishing you could hear
                              what he said about you.</p>
                           <p>"This place is a great resort for invalids, and people who like to be
                              retired. The iron-springs, that give the name to the town, are said to
                              be very strengthening; and the Neff House, near them, is a beautiful
                              hotel in very romantic scenery, and quite still. It seems to me that
                              the ladies I see riding out from it on horseback get healthier-looking
                              every day.</p>
                           <p>"I enclose a letter for mother, and will ask of you the favor to read
                              it to her. I cannot tell you, Mrs. Legrange, how grateful I feel to
                              you for making her so comfortable, as well as for what you are doing
                              for me. And it is not only you I thank and remember every morning and
                              every night; but, with yours, I say the name of the angel that we both
                              love so dear.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <salute>"Yours respectfully,</salute>

               </q>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange slowly folded the letter, and looked at her husband, saying
                  dreamily,—</p>
               <p>I should like to see this Mr. Brown. Perhaps he has some comfort for me; and that
                  was what I felt approaching in that letter."</p>
               <p>Mr. Legrange smiled a little compassionately, and more than a little tenderly.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, love, you would be disappointed. A man might seem a marvel of
                  eloquence and wisdom to poor<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5676-00000161"/> Theodore,
                  while you would find him a very commonplace, perhaps obtrusive individual."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange slowly shook her head.</p>
               <p>"I feel just as if that man could give me comfort. I must see him."</p>
               <p>"Very well, dear: if it will give you the slightest pleasure, you shall certainly
                  do so. Shall I send and invite him here? or do you think the journey to Ohio would
                  be a pleasant variety for you? Perhaps it might; and Teddy's elaborately artless
                  recommendation of the Neff House and the iron-springs is worthy of some
                  attention."</p>
               <p>"Yes: I will go there. I think I should like the journey, and I don't object to
                  trying the springs; and I should like to see Theodore, and hear him talk about
                  her. And I am sure I shall not find Mr. Brown commonplace or obtrusive."</p>
               <p>"Very well, dear: it shall be as you say. When shall we go? It will be very hot
                  travelling now, I am afraid."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! I don't mind. But I don't want to interfere with the Western excursion
                  Theodore so modestly suggests; nor do I wish to go while he is away. We will go in
                  the middle of September, I think."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that will do, and will give you something to be thinking of meantime," said
                  Mr. Legrange, looking with satisfaction at the healthy animation of his wife's
                  face, as she re-read the portion of Teddy's letter relating to Yellow Springs and
                  the Neff House.</p>
               <p>"And now," said she, "go and send Mrs. Ginniss up to me to hear her letter too,
                  that is, if you please; for, you humor me so much, I know I am growing tyrannical
                  in speech as well as in act."</p>
               <p>Mr. Legrange stooped to kiss his wife's cheek; and, to his eyes, the faint smile
                  with which she repaid the caress was the fair dawn of a brighter day.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE FIRST CHANCE.</head>
               <p>MR. BROWN had been a week at Outpost, and, at breakfast one morning, announced his
                  departure for the succeeding day.</p>
               <p>"And if you feel able to ride so far, Dora," continued he, "perhaps you will show
                  me the way to the curious mounds we heard of from Dr. Gershom."</p>
               <p>"They are full ten miles from here, he said," remarked Kitty disapprovingly.</p>
               <p>"To-day is the 24th, isn't it, Dora? the 24th of August?" inquired Karl; and Dora,
                  if no other of his auditors, saw the connection between this remark and the
                  proposed long ride with Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Karl; it is the 24th: and I think we can make a party for the mounds, Mr.
                  Brown. Kitty, wouldn't you like to go? and, Karl, can't you take a holiday?
                  Sunshine might stay with Mehitable for once; mightn't she?"</p>
               <p>"No; because she speaks too loud, and through her nose: but I'll stay with Argus
                  and the woods," said Sunshine quietly.</p>
               <p>"But have we horses enough?" asked Kitty with animation.</p>
               <p>"That is easily settled," interposed Karl eagerly. "I will fix Sunshine's pillion
                  upon Major, and Dora can ride behind me. Then Kitty can take Max, and Mr. Brown
                  will ride his own horse."</p>
               <p>"Oh! there is no need of Major's carrying double," said Dora hastily. "Seth can
                  spare Sally as well as not, and Kitty can ride her better than she can Max."</p>
               <p>At this decision, Kitty looked a little vexed, and Karl a little discomfited;
                  while Mr. Brown bent over his plate to hide a sudden gleam of humor in his dark
                  eyes. As they all rose from table, Karl passed close to his cousin, and
                  whispered,—</p>
               <p>"I want to speak to you before we go."</p>
               <p>Dora made no answer; nor, in the busy hour before they started, could her cousin
                  find opportunity for a single private word. Nor was he more successful in the bold
                  push made by him, so soon as they had started, for the place beside Dora; for she,
                  thinking just then of some important communication for Kitty's ear, reined her
                  pony close to<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC5676-00000163"/> that younger lady's, and
                  good-humoredly desired him to ride on out of earshot. Karl obeyed the mandate with
                  something less than his usual amiability, and was riding on in advance of the
                  whole party, when he found himself detained by Mr. Brown, who asked some trifling,
                  question about the road, and then attempted a conversation upon the crops and
                  other ordinary topics for a few moments; until, unable to contend with the
                  indifference, if not impatience, Karl was at no trouble to conceal, he remained
                  silent for a moment, and then said abruptly,—</p>
               <p>"Windsor, this is not soldierly or manly."</p>
               <p>Karl looked at him, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"We both know what is in the other's mind," continued Mr. Brown, and we know that
                  we cannot both succeed; but that is no reason for ill feeling toward each other.
                  If we were Don Quixotes, we might fight; if we were gamesters, we might throw for
                  the first chance: but as we are, I trust, Christian gentlemen, we owe each other
                  every kindly feeling short of a wish for success."</p>
               <p>"Yes: you can hardly expect that of me; and I'm sure I don't of you," said Karl,
                  half laughing.</p>
               <p>"No: that were inconsistent with a true earnestness of purpose," said Mr. Brown.
                  "And, after all, the girl we both love is no such weakling as to accept a man
                  simply because he asks her. She will decide between us fairly and justly."</p>
               <p>"Then let me have the first chance, since you think it no advantage," said Karl
                  impetuously.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown smiled grimly.</p>
               <p>"Is there not some proverb about age before merit?" asked he. "Besides, you have
                  had more than four years to ask your question in, and can very well wait a few
                  hours longer. I came to Iowa on purpose to ask mine, and shall go away
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>I don't see, sir, but you saints are just as obstinate in getting what you want as
                  we sinners," said the younger man petulantly.</p>
               <p>The chaplain laughed outright.</p>
               <p>"A man at thirty has seldom subdued his worldly passions and intentions to the
                  degree of sainthood," said he. "And I will not deny that my heart is very much
                  engaged in this matter. However, I will be generous, and you may take your chance
                  first."</p>
               <p>He reined in his steed as he spoke, and, waiting beside the road until the young
                  ladies came up, made some remark to Kitty relating to a question she had asked him
                     concerning<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC5676-00000164"/> ing Virginian roads as
                  compared with those of the West, and, by turning into the track beside her, rather
                  obliged Dora to ride forward to the turn of the road, where Karl awaited her. But
                  Kitty's satisfaction in the decided intention Mr. Brown had shown of speaking to
                  her was rather dampened by perceiving how frequently his attention wandered from
                  what she was saying, and how earnestly his eyes were fixed upon the two figures
                  riding briskly in advance.</p>
               <p>"If he can only look at Dora, why don't he go and ride with her?" muttered Kitty;
                  and, as her companion turned his eyes inquiringly upon her, she asked aloud,—</p>
               <p>"Are you pretty quick at hearing, Mr. Brown?"</p>
               <p>"Not especially. Why?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I thought you looked as if you would like to hear what Charlie is saying to
                  Dora."</p>
               <p>"And you thought it was very rude of me to be so inattentive to you," added Mr.
                  Brown, bending his dark eyes upon her with a smile.</p>
               <p>Kitty colored guiltily, and answered hastily,—</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, no! I'm used to finding myself of no account beside Dora."</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown looked again at her, and then, with a sudden association of ideas,
                  asked,—</p>
               <p>"Kitty, are you going to tell me, before I go away, what made you feel so badly
                  the day I came and found you in the wood?"</p>
               <p>Again Kitty's face glowed beneath his gaze, and her bright black eyes drooped in
                  rare confusion. She was about to answer hastily and coldly, but found herself
                  checked by a softer impulse. Why should she not tell him somewhat of the trouble
                  at her heart, and so win at least sympathy and pity, if nothing more? So she said
                  in a low voice,—</p>
               <p>"No one cares much for me, I think."</p>
               <p>"No one?—not your brother?"</p>
               <p>Kitty raised her eyes to the far vista point where Karl and Dora vanished into the
                  forest, their horses moving close to each other's side, and then brought them back
                  to the face of her companion. The look was eloquent, and he said,—</p>
               <p>"Yes; but by and by, perhaps, he will not be so engrossed."</p>
               <p>The young girl raised her head with a superb gesture.</p>
               <p>"To wait for by and by, when some one else has done with him, is not my idea of
                  love."</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown looked at her more attentively, and smiled.</p>
               <p>"I think the day will come when some man will love you<pb n="328-329"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000165"/> first and best of all," said he, in a tone, not of
                  flattery, but of honest admiration, which fell like sunlight upon the waste places
                  of poor Kitty's heart.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I'm not good enough, or smart enough, or good-looking enough. He never will,"
                  replied she hastily, and then colored crimson again at the meaning beneath her
                  words.</p>
               <p>Again Mr. Brown keenly eyed her, and asked,—</p>
               <p>"He? Do you mean some one in particular? No: forgive me. I have no right to ask
                  such a question. I am only your friend, not a father confessor."</p>
               <p>Kitty, dumb with confusion and a sudden terror, made no effort to reply; and,
                  after a moment, Mr. Brown led the way to a quiet conversation upon the young
                  girl's previous life, her early pursuits and affections, and finally to the
                  passionate love and regret for her dead mother, in which he found the key to all
                  she was and all she might be. So employed, the psychological student even forgot
                  his own affairs, and for half an hour hardly remembered Dora riding on beside
                  Karl, who, like the cowardly bather, dallying first with one foot and then the
                  other in the water's edge, and losing all his courage before the final plunge, had
                  talked with her of almost every thing beneath the sun, and worn out his own
                  patience and hers, before she said, turning her clear eyes full upon him,—</p>
               <p>"Karl, be honest and straightforward. It is kinder to us both."</p>
               <p>The young man heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
               <p>"That's it, Dora. There isn't another such girl in the world. Don't you know, in
                  camp I used to say I relied upon you for protection, and for making a man of me
                  instead of an idle boy? O Dora! there's nothing you couldn't do with me."</p>
               <p>He spoke the last words in an imploring voice, and fixed his eyes upon her averted
                  face. Then, as she did not speak, he went on:—</p>
               <p>"It isn't any thing I can offer you, Dora, except the chance of doing good: I know
                  that well enough. What I am, you know; but what I might become to please you none
                  of us can know. And I do love you so, Dora! I know it sounds bald and silly to say
                  just those few words; but they mean so much to me! and I've meant it so long and
                  so heartily! No; don't speak just yet: I want to make you feel first, if I can,
                  how dreadfully in earnest I am. When I first saw you there at your old home, and
                  you took care of me so tenderly, and looked at me, so pityingly out of your<pb
                     n="330-331" xml:id="VAC5676-00000166"/> great brown eyes, my heart warmed to
                  you; and then in camp, you know—O Dora Darling! you cannot say but you knew how
                  dearly I grew to love you even then: and when I found you were my own kin; and
                  when you came to my own home, and my mother took you to her heart, and thanked God
                  for having given her another daughter, and such a daughter; and when I saw your
                  daily life among us, and saw how noble, and how unselfish, and how true, and
                  brave, you were through all the sorrow, and the trials, and the loneliness, and
                  the petty spite and insults, you had to endure; and then here, where you are like
                  a wise and gracious queen among her subjects,—O Dora! what is there in you that
                  does not call forth my highest love, my truest reverence? and what better could
                  life do for me than to grant me the privilege of worshipping and following you all
                  my days, and making myself into just what sort of man would suit you best?"</p>
               <p>And the true-hearted young fellow felt his words strike home to his own soul so
                  earnestly that he could add to them nothing of the flood of tenderness and homage
                  swelling there, but only looked at his cousin piteously; while she, with drooping
                  head and averted eyes, rode on for a few moments in silence, and then said
                  softly,—</p>
               <p>"I hoped, dear Karl, you would never speak of it again. We have been so happy the
                  last year!"—</p>
               <p>"O Dora!" interposed the young man in a voice of agony, "never say you are going
                  to refuse me! Happy! yes, I have been happy, because I have looked forward to this
                  day, and thought it might be the beginning of a life to which this has been but
                  the gray dawn before the sunrise. You have been so kind to me, so frank and
                  affectionate! and all the time you knew—oh,! you must have known—what was in my
                  heart. Yes; and, if it had not been for this meddling parson's visit"—</p>
               <p>"Hush, Karl!" interrupted Dora decisively. "I will not have you unjust or
                  ungenerous to a man far nobler and purer and wiser than either you or I. Mr.
                  Brown's visit has nothing to do with what I say to-day; nor did I know, as you
                  think I did, that you would again ask me the question you asked a year ago. I only
                  remembered it, when, last week, you reminded me of the date; and I only let you
                  speak to-day, because it is better for us both to say out all that is in our
                  hearts, and then to let the matter rest."</p>
               <p>She, paused a moment, and recommenced in a lower and more tender voice:—</p>
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5676-00000167"/>
               <p>"I am so sorry, Karl, to give you pain! If the only trouble was that I don't want
                  to marry you, I wouldn't mind saying no; for I love you very much: only I don't
                  believe it is the way girls commonly love the men they marry. But it wouldn't be
                  right."</p>
               <p>"Not right! Oh! why not right, Dora?"</p>
               <p>"Because it would spoil both of us. You ask me to make any thing of you I like;
                  but that is not the way. It is you yourself that must make a man of yourself. If I
                  should try to do it, I should only make a puppet of you, and a conceited,
                  tyrannical woman of myself. It would not be good for me to rule as you want me to
                  do; and surely no man would deliberately say it would be good for him to be ruled,
                  and that by his wife."</p>
               <p>There was a touch of scorn in the tone of the last words; and Karl's check flushed
                  hotly, as he said,—</p>
               <p>"It's hard that you should despise me for loving you so well that I am ready to
                  forget pride and manly dignity, and every thing else, for the sake of it."</p>
               <p>"No; but, Karl, don't you see yourself what an injury such a love must be to you?
                  Forget pride and manly dignity and self-respect do you say? A true love, a good
                  love, would make you cherish them as you never did before; would make you claim
                  and hold every inch of manhood that is in you, so that you might feel yourself
                  worthy of that love. O, Karl! never again offer to put yourself under the foot of
                  any woman, but wait till you meet one whom you can hold by the hand, and lead
                  along, keeping equal step with yourself, and both pressing forward to a common
                  goal."</p>
               <p>She turned her face upon him, all aglow with a noble enthusiasm far above the
                  maiden bashfulness that but now had held it averted, and extended her hand,
                  saying,—</p>
               <p>"Come, dear Karl, forget this idle dream. Be once more my brother and my helper.
                  Trust me, no one cares more for you so than I; not Kitty herself."</p>
               <p>He took the hand, put it to his lips, then rode on silently.</p>
               <p>Dora's kind eyes sought his again and again, but vainly. His face, pale and
                  somewhat stern gave no clew to the feelings within: the mouth, more firmly set
                  than its wont, seemed sealed to love forever.</p>
               <p>For the first time in all the interview, Dora found herself troubled and
                  perplexed. Here was nothing to soothe, nothing to combat, nothing to answer or to
                  silence; and her womanly sympathies fluttered about this manly reticence like a
                  humming-bird around a flower frozen into the heart of an iceberg.</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5676-00000168"/>
               <p>At last, she spoke; and her voice had grown almost caressing in its softness:—</p>
               <p>"You're not angry with me, Karl?"</p>
               <p>He glanced at her, then away.</p>
               <p>"Certainly not, Dora. On the contrary, I am much obliged to you."</p>
               <p>"Obliged to me!" exclaimed Dora; her feminine pique just touched a trifle. "What,
                  for saying no?"</p>
               <p>"For showing me that I am a fool. It was time I knew it, and I had rather hear it
                  from you than any one. Why should you care for me? I am not a man to respect, like
                  Mr. Brown, or one to admire, like Mr. Burroughs,—I suppose it will be one of them;
                  but I only hope either one may give you half— No matter, wait here a moment in the
                  shade. I am going back to speak to Kitty."</p>
               <p>He sharply wheeled his horse as he spoke, and was gone. Dora looked after him in
                  sorrowful perplexity, and then tears gathered in her eyes; but, before they could
                  fall, the unswerving rectitude underlying her whole nature came to its relief, and
                  she dashed them away, murmuring,—</p>
               <p>"But I was right."</p>

               <head type="sub">THE SECOND CHANCE.</head>
               <p>REINING up her horse under the shadow of a clump of trees, Dora waited, as her
                  cousin had requested, for his return; and so much pre-occupied was she with her
                  own thoughts, that she failed to hear the quick footfalls of an approaching horse,
                  until his rider slackened speed beside her, and Dora, looking up, saw that it was
                  Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>She grew a little pale, divining, not only from the presence of the chaplain, but
                  from a joyous and significant light in the eyes that encountered hers, what might
                  be his errand; and though she had not failed to foresee this moment, no man, and
                  surely no woman, is ever so prepared for the great crises of life that they fail
                  to come at the last with almost as much of a shock as if they came quite
                  unawares.</p>
               <p>She turned her horse into the track, and rode on, her eyes fixed upon the wide
                  prairie-view, which seemed to dance and shimmer before them as if all Nature had
                  suddenly grown as strange and unreal as she felt herself.<pb n="336-337"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000169"/> Her companion spoke, and in her ears his voice
                  sounded as from some far mountain-cave, hollow, broken, and vague; and yet the
                  words were far from momentous.</p>
               <p>"Dora, I must leave you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, sir," faltered Dora; and Mr. Brown, glancing at her face, could
                  not but notice its unwonted agitation. His own wishes, and his sex, led him to
                  misconstrue it; and, pressing, his horse closer to her side, he said
                  joyfully,—</p>
               <p>"And so am I sorry, Dora; but I need not be gone long if you wish for my
                  return."</p>
               <p>Dora did not speak; indeed, she could not: for the wild dance of sky and plain, of
                  prairie and forest, grew yet wilder; and in her ears the voice of the chaplain
                  mingled with a dizzy hum that almost drowned the words. She grasped the horn of
                  her saddle with both hands, and only thought of saving herself from falling. The
                  horse was halted, an arm was about her waist, her head drawn to a resting-place
                  upon a steady shoulder; and that strange, far-off voice murmured,—</p>
               <p>"My darling, my long-loved, long-sought treasure, calm yourself; be happy and
                  secure in my love. Did you ever doubt that it was yours?"</p>
               <p>He stooped to kiss her: but, at the motion, the virginal instincts of the young
                  girl's nature rallied to the defence; and, with a sudden spring, Dora sat upright,
                  her face very pale, but her eyes clear and steadfast as their wont.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, indeed you must not!" cried she, as pleadingly as a little child, who
                  will not be caressed, yet knows not why he should refuse.</p>
               <p>"Must not, Dora?" persisted the lover gayly. "But why must I not kiss my own
                  betrothed?"</p>
               <p>"But I am not; I cannot be. Don't be angry, sir: I would have spoken sooner; but I
                  could not. I believe I was a little faint;" and Dora's eyes timidly sought those
                  of the chaplain, who, meeting them, remembered many such a glance when his pupil
                  had feared to displease him by inattention or disobedience. Again he thought to
                  have discovered the source of her refusal, and again he failed.</p>
               <p>"Dora," said he gently, "you do not forget, that, some years ago, we bore the
                  relation of master and pupil; and you still regard me with a certain deference and
                  reserve, which, perhaps, blinds you to the true relation existing between us now.
                  Remember, dear, that I am yet a younger man; and although my profession may have
                  induced a certain gravity of manner, contrasting, perhaps unpleasantly,<pb
                     n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5676-00000170"/> with your gay cousins joyous demeanor,
                  I have all, or more than all, of his fervency of feeling; far more, I trust, of
                  depth and steadfastness in my love for you."</p>
               <p>"Please, Mr. Brown," interposed Dora, "do not let us say any thing about Karl. He
                  is not concerned in this."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Dora, and I was wrong," said Mr. Brown with a little effort of
                  magnanimity. "But I was only trying to convince you that my love is quite as
                  ardent, and quite as tender, as that of a younger and gayer man could be."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Dora timidly, as he paused for her assent.</p>
               <p>"Not 'Yes, sir,' child!" exclaimed the chaplain impatiently. "Don't treat me with
                  this distant respect and timid reverence. I am your lover, your would-be comrade
                  through life, as once through the less earnest battles of war. Call me Frank, and
                  look into my face and smile as I have seen you smile on Karl."</p>
               <p>A quick smile dimpled Dora's cheek, and passed.</p>
               <p>"Not Karl, please, sir."</p>
               <p>"Dora, if you say 'sir' to me again, I'll kiss you."</p>
               <p>"Please not, Mr. Brown," said Dora demurely, "until you quite understand me."</p>
               <p>"Well then, let me quite understand you very quick; for I think I shall exact the
                  penalty, even without further offence."</p>
               <p>"But I cannot promise,—I cannot be what you said," stammered Dora, half terrified,
                  half confused.</p>
               <p>"Nay, darling,—I am going to always call you that, as expressive both of name and
                  nature,—it is you who do not quite understand either yourself or me. I do not
                  expect, or even wish, you to profess a love for me as ardent, open, and pronounced
                  as my own: that were to make you other than the modest and delicately reserved
                  maiden I have loved so long. All I ask you to feel is, that you can trust yourself
                  to my guidance through life; that you can place your future in my hands, believing
                  me capable of shaping it aright; that you can promise to tread with me the path I
                  have selected, sure that it shall be my care to remove from it all thorns, all
                  obstacles that mortal power may control, and that my arms shall bear you tenderly
                  over the rough places I cannot make smooth for you.</p>
               <p>"Dora, years ago I resolved that you should be my wife, God and you consenting. I
                  have waited until I thought you old enough to decide calmly and wisely; but,
                  through these years of waiting, I have cherished a hope, almost a<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000171"/> certainty, of success, that has struck deep roots
                  among the very foundations of my life. You will not tear it away! Dora, you do not
                  know me: you cannot guess at the ardor or the power of a love I have never dared
                  wholly to reveal even to myself. Trust it, Dora: it cannot but make you happy.
                  Give yourself to me, dear child; and I will account to God for the precious
                  charge."</p>
               <p>Never man was more in earnest, never was wooing at once so fervent and so lofty in
                  its tone; and so Dora felt it. The temptation to yield, without further struggle,
                  to the belief that Mr. Brown knew better what was good for her than she knew for
                  herself, was very great; but, even while she hesitated, the inherent truthfulness
                  of her nature rose up, and cried, "No, no! you shall not do such wrong to me who
                  am the Right!" and turning, with an effort, to meet the keen eyes reading her
                  face, she said, still timidly perhaps, but very calmly,—</p>
               <p>"I am but a simple girl, almost a child in some things, and you are a wise and
                  good man, learned in books and in the way of the world; but I must judge for
                  myself, and must believe my own heart sooner than you in such matters as these.
                  Years ago, as you say, I was your pupil, and you then nobly offered to adopt me as
                  your child or sister."</p>
               <p>"As my future wife, Dora. I meant it from the very first," interposed the chaplain
                  impetuously.</p>
               <p>"I did not know that: perhaps it makes a difference. But, at any rate, I promised
                  then, that if I went home with Capt. Karl, and you wanted me afterward, I would
                  come to you whenever you said so."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; that is quite true: well?" demanded Mr. Brown eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, a promise is a promise; and, if you demand it now, I will come and
                  live with you, or you can come, and live with me,—not as your wife, however, but
                  as your sister and child and friend."</p>
               <p>"You will come and live with me, but not marry me!" exclaimed the young man, with
                  a gleam of amusement at the unworldly proposal lighting his dark eyes.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied Dora, without looking up.</p>
               <p>To her infinite astonishment and dismay, she found herself suddenly embraced, and
                  a hearty kiss tingling upon her lips.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry if you don't like it, Dora; but I said I would if you called me 'sir'
                  again; and you are so scrupulous about your promises, you cannot wish me to break
                  mine."</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC5676-00000172"/>
               <p>"Then I am afraid I must promise, if you do so again, to go back and ride with
                  Kitty all the rest of the way," said Dora, as, with heightened color and a decided
                  pout, she drew her left-hand rein so sharply as to wheel Max to the other side of
                  the road.</p>
               <p>"Dora, I am afraid you are a little of a coquette, after all!" exclaimed the
                  lover, gazing at her with admiration.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no indeed, Mr. Brown! I wouldn't be for the world! I said just what I meant
                  to you. I always do."</p>
               <p>"But why, then, if you love me well enough to live with me as sister, child, or
                  friend, can't you also live with me as wife?"</p>
               <p>"Because, sir,—oh, no! I didn't mean sir,—because"—</p>
               <p>"Frank, I told you to call me."</p>
               <p>"Because, Frank, I don't love you that way."</p>
               <p>The answer was so explicit, so unembarrassed, and so quiet, that, for the first
                  time, Mr. Brown believed it.</p>
               <p>"Not love me, Dora, when I love you so much!" exclaimed he in dismay.</p>
               <p>"Not love you in a wife way, Frank, but a great deal in every other way. And then
                  I don't think we should be happy together if we were married."</p>
               <p>"And why not?" asked the young man, smiling in spite of himself at the quiet
                  opinion.</p>
               <p>"Because, as you said, you want me to put my life into your hands, and you will
                  shape it; and you want me to set my feet in your path, and follow it with you; and
                  you want me to trust my soul to you, and you will guide it: but I could never do
                  that, Mr. Brown; never for any man, I think. I could never forget that God has
                  given me a life, and a path, and a soul, all my own, and not to be judged except
                  by Him and myself: and I am afraid I should always be asking if your guiding was
                  in the same direction that I was meant to go; and, if I thought it was not, I
                  should be very unhappy, and should try to live my own life, and not yours; and
                  that would make trouble."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that would make trouble certainly, Dora," said the chaplain gravely. "But
                  are you sure that a young and comparatively unlearned woman like yourself would be
                  a better judge of what was right and best than a man of mature years, who has made
                  the care of souls his profession and most earnest duty?"</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Brown, not if I judged for myself: but I think God has especial care of
                  those, who, like me, have none else to guide them; and I think this voice in my
                  heart is the surest teaching of all."</p>
               <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC5676-00000173"/>
               <p>The profound conviction of her tone was final; the simple faith of her argument
                  was unassailable: and Mr. Brown, skillful polemic that he was, found himself
                  silenced.</p>
               <p>After a moment, he said calmly,—</p>
               <p>"Dora, you will not forget that this is, to me at least, a very serious, indeed a
                  vital matter. Is what you have just said the solemn conviction of your own heart?
                  or have you suffered yourself to be misled by the tendency to self-esteem and
                  perverseness I have sometimes had occasion to reprove in you? Have you thoroughly
                  searched your own heart to its deepest depths? and is not your refusal tinctured
                  by the natural reluctance of a determined nature to yield to a love, which, in
                  woman, must bring with it some degree of dependence and deference?"</p>
               <p>He looked almost severely into the pale face and earnest eyes upraised to his, and
                  read there pain, anxiety, an humble appeal, but not one trace of hesitation, not
                  one shade of duplicity.</p>
               <p>"I have searched my own heart, Mr. Brown; and I am sure of its answer. I never,
                  never, can be your wife, so long as we both live."</p>
               <p>"That is sufficient, Dora. I am rightly punished for building my hopes and my
                  happiness upon the sandy foundations dations of an earthly love. They perish, and
                  leave me desolate; but, among the ruins, I yet can say, 'It is rightly and justly
                  done.'"</p>
               <p>The bitter pain in his voice pierced to Dora's very heart, and wounded it almost
                  as sorely as she had wounded his. The rare tears overflowed her eyes; and,
                  pressing close to his side, she laid a hand upon his own, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, forgive me!—say you forgive me! Indeed, I must do and say what conscience
                  bids me, at all cost."</p>
               <p>"It is not for me to gainsay such a precept as that," said the chaplain.</p>
               <p>"But I will come to you, and live as long as you want me. I will be everything but
                  wife. Say I may do this, or I shall never forgive myself. Say I may make some
                  amends for the pain I have given you."</p>
               <p>The young man laughed bitterly, then, turning suddenly, seized both her hands, and
                  looked deep into her eyes.</p>
               <p>"My poor child," cried he, "my innocent lamb, who turns from the shepherd because
                  she will not be guided, and yet is all unfit to guide herself! Do not even you,
                  Dora, guileless and unworldly as you are, see how impossible it would be for a
                  young and beautiful girl to live with a man who admires and loves her openly,
                  without such<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5676-00000174"/> scandal, as should ruin
                  both in the world's eyes, even if they saved their own souls unspotted?"</p>
               <p>Dora snatched away her hands, and her whole face flamed with a sudden shame.</p>
               <p>She was learning fast to-day in the book of human passion, suffering, and sin.</p>
               <p>Without comment upon her embarrassment, the chaplain went on:—</p>
               <p>"No, Dora: I must lay aside the dream of four sweet years, and take up my lonely
                  life without disguise or embellishment. I cannot dispute your decision. I will not
                  by one word or look urge you to change it; for I too deeply respect the
                  truthfulness of your character to dream that it is capable of change. I do not say
                  that I forgive you, for you have done nothing calling for forgiveness; and yet, if
                  your tender heart should suffer, in thinking of my suffering, remember always that
                  what you have to-day said has increased my respect and esteem for you fourfold:
                  and, if it has also added to the bitterness of my disappointment, I will not have
                  you reproach yourself; for I would rather reverence you as the wife of another
                  than to claim you as my own, and know you untrue to yourself. And now, dear, the
                  subject is closed utterly and forever."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">TREASURE-TROVE.</head>
               <p>IT was a balmy September evening, some weeks after Mr. Brown's return to Ohio,
                  when Karl, or, as he was now generally styled, Dr. Windsor, standing beside his
                  horse, in the quiet Main Street of Greenfield, saw Dr. Gershom riding lazily into
                  town, accompanied by a sturdy, good-looking lad, also on horseback, whom Karl
                  failed to recognize.</p>
               <p>"A new student, maybe," thought he, and, taking his foot out of the stirrup,
                  waited to see.</p>
               <p>"Hollo, Windsor, hold on a minute!" shouted Dr. Gershom as they approached.
                  "Here's a young gentleman asking for you."</p>
               <p>Karl bowed, and began hastily to review his half-forgotten army acquaintances;
                  failing, however, to identify any of them with the young man now bowing to him,
                  and taking a letter from his pocket-book.</p>
               <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC5676-00000175"/>
               <p>"Mr. Brown favored me with this letter of introduction to you, sir," said he,
                  holding it out.</p>
               <p>Karl glanced hastily at the few lines, and remembered an allusion the chaplain had
                  made to a particularly promising student of his, whom he thought of sending to
                  travel a little in the West. So he frankly smiled, extended his hand, and
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes! I have heard Mr. Brown speak of you, Mr. Ginniss; and I am very happy to
                  welcome you to our prairie life. I am just setting out for home; and, if you
                  please, we will ride along directly."</p>
               <p>"Better come in, boys, and have a glass of bitters to keep the night-air off your
                  stomachs. Got some of the real stuff right here in the office," said the old
                  doctor; but, both young men declining the proffered hospitality, he withdrew,
                  grumbling,—</p>
               <p>"You never'll make it work, Windsor, I tell you now! Such a dog's life as a
                  country doctor's isn't to be kept up without fuel."</p>
               <p>Karl laughed, and, turning to his new acquaintance, said,—</p>
               <p>"So they told me in the army; but I got through without. I never tasted spirit but
                  once, and then I didn't like it."</p>
               <p>"I never have at all," said Ginniss simply. "I gave my mother a promise, when I
                  was twelve years old, that I never would; and I never have."</p>
               <p>Karl nodded.</p>
               <p>"That's right," said he; "and all the better for you to have had such a
                  mother."</p>
               <p>"You'd say that, Mr. Windsor, if you knew what she'd done for me. There ain't many
                  such mothers in any class," said the young man heartily.</p>
               <p>Karl looked at his new acquaintance with increasing favor, and found something
                  very attractive in his open, manly face, and the honest smile with which he met
                  his scrutiny.</p>
               <p>"I hope you'll stay with us some time, Mr. Ginniss," said he heartily.</p>
               <p>"Thank you; but, I believe, only for one day. The journey was my principal object
                  in coming; and I must be at Antioch College again in a week, or ten days at the
                  outside."</p>
               <p>"Tell me about the life there. I was at old Harvard, and never visited any other
                  college," said Karl; and the young men found plenty of conversation, until, in the
                  soft twilight, they came upon the pleasant slope and vine-clad buildings of
                  Outpost.</p>
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC5676-00000176"/>
               <p>"Here is our house, or rather my cousin's house," said Karl. "You have heard Mr.
                  Brown speak of Dora?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, before he went away," said Ginniss significantly.</p>
               <p>"But not since his return?" asked Karl eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Very seldom."</p>
               <p>"Hem! Seth, will you take our horses round? Jump off, and come in, sir. This is my
                  sister Kitty, Mr. Ginniss. A scholar of Mr. Brown's, Kitty: I dare say you
                  remember his speaking of him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed! Very happy to see you, Mr. Ginniss; walk in," said Kitty, who, if
                  she had never heard the line, certainly knew how to apply the idea, of,— <q>
                     <l>"It is not the rose; but it has lived near the rose."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Where is Dora?" asked Karl, glancing round the room where the pretty tea-table
                  stood spread, and Dora's hat and gloves lay upon a chair; but no other sign of her
                  presence was to be found.</p>
               <p>"Why," said Kitty, laughing a little, "Dolly took a fancy for rafting down the
                  river on a log that she somehow managed to push off from the bank. Of course, she
                  slipped off the first thing, and might have been drowned; but Argus got her out
                  somehow, and Seth, hearing the noise, ran down and brought her home. Of course,
                  she was dripping wet; and Dora has put her to bed."</p>
               <p>"Is it a sanitary or a disciplinary measure?" asked Karl: "because, if the latter,
                  we shall have Dora out of spirits all the evening. She never punishes Dolce half
                  so much as she does herself."</p>
               <p>"Well, I believe it is a little of both this time," replied Kitty. "I think she'll
                  be down to tea. You had better take Mr. Ginniss right into your bedroom, Charlie.
                  Perhaps he'd like to wash his hands before tea."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; I should, if you please," said the guest, and left the room with his
                  host.</p>
               <p>When they returned, Dora was waiting to receive them, somewhat pale and sad at
                  having felt obliged to refuse Sunshine's entreaties to "get up, and be the
                  'bedientest little girl that ever was," but courteously attentive to the guest,
                  and ready to be interested and sympathetic in hearing all Karl's little
                  experiences of the day. As for Kitty, her careless inquiry on seating herself at
                  the table, of,—</p>
               <p>"How has Mr. Brown been since he got home?" may serve as index to the course of
                  her meditations.</p>
               <p>"How in the world came Dolce to undertake the rafting business?" asked Karl, when
                  his sister's inquiries had been amply satisfied.</p>
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC5676-00000177"/>
               <p>"Why, poor little thing!" said Dora, laughing a little, "she thought she had found
                  the way to heaven. She noticed from the window how very blue the river was, and,
                  as she says, 'goldy all over in spots:' so she slipped out, and ran down there,
                  forgetting for once that she is forbidden to do so. Standing on the brink, she saw
                  the reflection of the little white clouds floating overhead, and was suddenly
                  possessed with an idea that this was heaven, or the entrance to it. So, as she
                  told me, she thought she would float out on the log till she got to the middle,
                  and then 'slip off, and fall right into heaven.'"</p>
               <p>"How absurd!" said Kitty, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Not at all. She would certainly have reached heaven if she had carried out the
                  plan," said Karl.</p>
               <p>"Don't, please," murmured Dora, with a little shiver. "Don't talk of it."</p>
               <p>"That is like a little sister of mine; a little adopted sister, at least. She was
                  always talking of going to heaven, and planning to get there," said the guest.</p>
               <p>Dora looked at him with pity in her honest eyes, and hastened to prevent Kitty's
                  evident intention of questioning him further with regard to this "little
                  sister."</p>
               <p>"It seems to be a natural instinct with children," said she "to long for heaven.
                  Perhaps that is the reason they bring so much of heaven to earth."</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid mothers of large and troublesome families would say that earth would
                  be better with less of heaven," suggested Karl slyly; and the conversation
                  suddenly veered to other topics. But all through the evening, and even after he
                  had gone to rest, the mind of Teddy Ginniss was haunted by the memory of the
                  pretty child, so loved and mourned, and of whom this anecdote of the little
                  heaven-seeker so forcibly reminded him.</p>
               <p>"Whose child is this, I wonder?" thought he a dozen times: but, in the hints he
                  had solicited from Mr. Brown upon manners, none had been more urgent than that
                  forbidding inquisition into other people's affairs; and indeed Teddy's natural
                  tact and refinement would have prevented his erring in this respect. So now he
                  held his peace, and slept unsatisfied.</p>
               <p>This may have been the reason of his rising unusually early,—in fact, while the
                  rosy clouds of dawn were yet in the sky,—and quietly leaving the house with the
                  purpose of a river-bath. Strolling some distance down the bank, until the
                  intervening trees shut off the house, he plunged in, and found himself much
                  refreshed by a swim of ten minutes<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC5676-00000178"/>
                  through waters gorgeous with the colors of the sunrise-sky; and, as he paused to
                  notice them, Teddy muttered,—</p>
               <p>"The poor little sister! She'd have done just the same if she'd been here."</p>
               <p>It was hardly time to return to the house when the young man stood again upon the
                  bank; and he strolled on through the wood, at this point touching upon the river
                  so closely, that a broken reflection of the green foliage curved and shimmered
                  along the fast-flowing waves.</p>
               <p>Teddy looked at the water; he looked at the trees; he looked long and eagerly
                  across the wide prairie that far westward imperceptibly melted its dim green into
                  the faint blue of the horizon, leaving between the two a belt of tender color,
                  nameless, but inexpressibly tempting and suggestive to the eye. All this the lad
                  saw, and, raising his face skyward, drew in a long draught of such air as never
                  reaches beyond the prairies.</p>
               <p>"Oh, but it's good!" exclaimed he, with more meaning to the simple phrase than
                  many a man has put to an oration. And then he muttered, as he walked on,—</p>
               <p>"If it wasn't for the thought that's always lying like a stone at the bottom of my
                  heart, there'd not be a happier fellow alive to-day than I. Oh the little
                  sister!—the little sister that I never shall forget, nor forgive myself for the
                  loss of!"</p>
               <p>And, from the cottonwood above his head, a mocking-bird, who had perhaps caught
                  the trick of grief from some neighbor whippoorwill, poured suddenly a flood of
                  plaintive melody, that to the boy's warm Irish fancy seemed a lament over the
                  loved and lost.</p>
               <p>He took off his hat, and looked up into the tree.</p>
               <p>"Heaven's blessings on you, birdy!" said he. "It's the very way I'd have said it
                  myself; but I didn't know how."</p>
               <p>The mocking-bird flew on; and Teddy followed, hoping for a repetition of the
                  strain: but the capricious little songster only twittered promises of a coming
                  happiness greater than any pleasure his best efforts could afford, and darted away
                  to the recesses of the forest, where was in progress an Art-Union <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">matinée</foreign> of such music as all the wealth of all our
                  cities cannot buy for us.</p>
               <p>Teddy followed for a while; and then, fearing that he should be lost in the
                  trackless wood, turned his back upon the rising sun, and walked, as be supposed,
                  in the direction of the house, his eyes upon the ground, his mind strangely busy
                  with thoughts and memories of the life he had left<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000179"/> so far behind, that, in the press and hurry of his
                  present career, it sometimes seemed hardly to belong to him.</p>
               <p>"God and my lady have been very good to me," thought the boy; "but I never'll be
                  as happy again as when the little sister put her arms about my neck, and called me
                  her dear Teddy, and kissed me with her own sweet mouth that maybe is dust and
                  ashes now. No: I never'll be happy that way again."</p>
               <p>He raised his eyes as he spoke, and started back, pale and trembling, fain to lean
                  against the nearest tree for support under the great shock.</p>
               <p>Not fifty feet from him, and bathed in the early sunlight that came sifting
                  through the trees to greet her, stood a child, dressed in a white robe, her sunny
                  hair crowned with flowers, her little hand holding sceptre-wise a long stalk with
                  snow-white bells drooping from its under edge. Her arms were bare to the shoulder,
                  and her slender feet gleamed white from the bed of moss that almost buried them.
                  Still as a little statue, or a celestial vision printing itself in one
                  never-to-be-forgotten moment upon the heart of the beholder, she stood looking at
                  him; and Teddy dropped upon his knees, gasping,—</p>
               <p>"It's out of glory you've come to comfort me, darling! and God ever bless you for
                  the same!"</p>
               <p>The child looked at him with her starry eyes, and slowly smiled.</p>
               <p>"I knew you sometime," said she. "Was it in heaven ?"</p>
               <p>"No: it's better than ever I'll be, you know, in heaven, little sister. Are you
                  happy there, mavourneen?" asked Teddy timidly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I haven't gone to heaven yet. I never could find the way," said the child,
                  with a troubled expression suddenly clouding her sweet face; and then she added
                  musingly,—</p>
               <p>"I thought I'd get there through the river last night; but I tumbled off the log,
                  and only got wet: and Dora said I was naughty; and so I had to go to bed, and not
                  have some supper, only"—</p>
               <p>"What's that, then!" shouted Teddy, springing to his feet, and holding out his
                  hands toward her, though not yet daring to approach. " It's not the spirit of the
                  little sister you are, but a live child?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'm alive; though, if I'd staid into the river, I wouldn't have been, Dora
                  says," replied Sunshine quietly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! but the Lord in heaven look down on us this day, and keep me from going
                  downright mad with the joy that's<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC5676-00000180"/>
                  breaking my heart! Is it yourself it is, O little sister! is it yourself that's in
                  it, and I alive to see it?"</p>
               <p>He was at her feet now, his white face all bathed with tears, his trembling
                  fingers timidly clasping her robe, his eyes raised imploringly to those serenely
                  bent upon him.</p>
               <p>"I knew you once and you was good to me," said the child musingly; "but I got
                  tired when I danced so much in the street. I don't ever dance now, only with
                  Argus."</p>
               <p>"But, little sister, are you just sure, it's yourself alive? And don't you mind I
                  was Teddy, and we used to go walking in the Gardens and on the Commons; and there
                  was the good mammy at home that used to rock you on her lap, and warm the pretty
                  little feet in her hands, and sing to you till you dropped asleep? Don't you mind
                  them things, Cherry darling?"</p>
               <p>The child looked attentively in his face while he thus spoke, and at the end
                  nodded several times; while a light, like that of earliest dawn, began to glimmer
                  in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Tell me some more," said she briefly.</p>
               <p>"And do you mind the picture-books I used to bring you home, and the story of the
                  Cock Robin you used to like so well to hear, and the skip-jack you played with,
                  and the big doll that mammy made for you, and you called it Susan?"—</p>
               <p>"O——h! Susan!" cried the child suddenly, and then stood all pale and trembling,
                  while her earnest eyes seemed searching in the past for some dimly-remembered
                  secret, which to lose was agony, to recall impossible.</p>
               <p>"Susan!" said she softly again. "Yes, there was Susan, somewhere, and— Oh! tell me
                  the rest, tell me who it was that loved me so!"</p>
               <p>"Sure, it was Teddy loved you best of all," said the boy longingly: for, though
                  her eager eyes dwelt upon his face, it was not for him or his that the depths of
                  her heart were stirring; and, with the old thrill of jealous pain, he felt it
                  so.</p>
               <p>But then from the remorse and bitterness of the fault he had never ceased to mourn
                  rose a nobler purpose, a higher love. He took the child in his arms, and kissed
                  her tenderly, then released her, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Good-by, little sister; for I never will call you so again, and you never more
                  will call me brother. It's your own lady-mother, darling, that you're missing and
                  mourning,—the own beautiful mother that lost you two years ago, and has gone to
                  heaven's gates looking for you, and never would have come back if you had not been
                  found. It's your own home, darling, that you have remembered for heaven; and<pb
                     n="360-361" xml:id="VAC5676-00000181"/> it's waiting for you, with father and
                  mother, and joy and plenty, all ready to receive you the minute you can get
                  there."</p>
               <p>But it was too much for the fine organization and sensitive temperament; and, as
                  Teddy's words reached her heart in their full meaning, the child, with a long
                  sobbing cry, fell forward into his arms, utterly insensible.</p>
               <p>Teddy, not too much terrified for he had seen her thus before, raised the slender
                  little figure in his arms, and carried it swiftly toward the house, now just
                  visible through a vista of the wood, but, before he reached it, met Dora coming to
                  look for her little charge.</p>
               <p>"Good-morning, Mr. Ginniss. So you have caught my naughty runaway," cried she
                  gayly; but coming near enough to notice Sunshine's drooping figure, and Teddy's
                  agitated face, she sprang forward, asking,—</p>
               <p>"Is any thing the matter with her? Where did you find her, Mr. Ginniss?"</p>
               <p>"She's fainted, ma'am; but it's with joy, and will never hurt her. It's you and I
                  that will be the sufferers, I'm afraid," said Teddy, with a sudden pang at his
                  heart of love not yet cleansed of selfish jealousy.</p>
               <p>"Bring her to the house, please, as quickly as you can. Poor little darling, she
                  is so delicate!" said Dora, not yet caring to ask this strange news, but walking
                  close beside Teddy, her hand clasping that cold little one which swung nervelessly
                  over his shoulder, her eyes anxiously watching the beautiful pale face, half
                  hidden in the showering curls.</p>

               <head type="sub">TEDDY'S PRIVILEGE.</head>
               <p>To Mr. Burroughs, smoking his cigar upon the piazza of the Neff House, came a
                  white-jacketed waiter with a card.</p>
               <p>"The gentleman is waiting in the reception-room, sir," said he.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs paused to watch an unusually perfect ring of smoke lazily floating
                  above his head; then took the card, and read in pencil,—</p>
               <p>"Theodore Ginniss would be glad to see Mr. Burroughs a moment on important
                  business."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Well, it is a republic, and this is the West; but only Jack's bean-stalk
                  parallels such a growth." So said, in his own heart, Teddy Ginniss's former
                  master, as he drew two or three rapid whiffs from the stump of his cigar, and
                  then, throwing it into the grass, strolled leisurely into the reception-room.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Ginniss! how are you?" inquired he of the pale and nervous young man, who
                  stood up to receive him, half extending his hand, but dropping it quickly upon
                  perceiving those of Burroughs immovable.</p>
               <p>"I am well, sir, thank you."</p>
               <p>"Want to see me on business, do you say?" continued the lawyer coolly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir." And, as his true purpose and position came back to him, Teddy suddenly
                  straightened himself, and grew as cool as the stately gentleman waiting with
                  patient courtesy for his errand.</p>
               <p>"I thought, sir, I'd come to you first, as it was to you I first had occasion to
                  speak of my fault in hiding her. 'Toinette is found, sir!"</p>
               <p>"What! 'Toinette Legrange found! Teddy, your hand, my boy! Found by you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Teddy, suffering his hand to be shaken.</p>
               <p>"But what I wanted most was to ask if you think it safe to tell Mrs.
                  Legrange."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I'll see to that. Of course, it must be done very delicately. But where is
                  the child now? and when did you find her?"</p>
               <p>"If you please, Mr. Burroughs, I should like to tell the story first to Mrs.
                  Legrange, and I should like to tell her<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC5676-00000183"/>
                  all myself. It was I that hurt her, or helped to hurt her; and I'd like to be the
                  one to give her the great joy that's waiting for her. Besides, sir," and Teddy's
                  face grew white again, "though I did what was wrong enough, I never deny, I have
                  suffered for it more, maybe, than you can think of; and this is all the amends I
                  could ever want. Mrs. Legrange has been very good to me, sir, and never blamed me,
                  or spoke an unkind word, even at the first."</p>
               <p>"And I spoke a good many, you're thinking," said Mr. Burroughs keenly. "Well,
                  Teddy, I am a man, and Mrs. Legrange is a woman; and women look at matters more
                  leniently and less exactly than we do. But you must not be satisfied with pity
                  instead of justice; for that will be to encourage your self-esteem at the expense
                  of your manhood. I do not deny that I never have recovered from my surprise at
                  finding you had so long deceived me; but the news you bring to-day makes amends
                  for much: and, after I have heard the particulars, I may yet be able to forget the
                  past, and feel to you as I used."</p>
               <p>But Teddy's bow, though respectful, was not humble; and he only asked in
                  reply,—</p>
               <p>"Where shall I find Mrs. Legrange, sir?"</p>
               <p>"She walked down to the glen about half an hour ago. You may follow her there, if
                  you please; and, since you insist upon it as a right, I will leave you to break
                  the news to her alone. But you will remember, I hope, that she is very
                  delicate,—very easily startled. You will have to be exceedingly cautious."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir;" and with a ceremonious bow the young man left the room, and the next
                  minute was seen darting along the path to the glen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs looked after him appreciatively, and muttered,—</p>
               <p>"A nice-looking fellow, and not without self-respect. I see no reason why, in half
                  a dozen years, he should not enter his name at the Suffolk bar itself, and stand
                  as well as any man on the roll. But my little Sunshine! Confound the boy! why
                  couldn't he have told me where to find her?"</p>
               <p>So Mr. Burroughs went back to the piazza, and tried to quiet himself with another
                  cigar, but was too nervous to make any more rings; while Teddy sped away to the
                  glen, and presently found himself in a cool and cavernous retreat, which the
                  sunlight only penetrated by dancing down with the waters that slid laughingly over
                  a rock ledge above, and shook themselves into spray before they reached the pool
                  below, then, after dimpling and sporting there for a moment,<pb n="366-367"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000184"/> danced merrily away. At either hand, high walls of
                  rock, half hid in trailing vines and clinging herbage, shut out the heat of day;
                  and, through a thousand ever-changing peepholes among the swaying foliage, the
                  blue sky looked gayly down, and challenged those who hid in the glen to come
                  forth, and dare the fervor of the mid-day sun.</p>
               <p>Under a tree near the foot of the fall sat Mrs. Legrange, her head leaning upon
                  her hand, her book idle upon her lap, watching dreamily the waters that swayed and
                  ebbed, and paused and coquetted with every flower or leaf that bent toward them;
                  and yet in the end went on, always on, as the idlest of us go, until through the
                  merry brook, the heedless fall, the sparkling stream, and stately river, we reach
                  at last the ocean, calm, changeless, and eternal in its unmoved depths.</p>
               <p>The lady looked up with a little start as she heard the approaching footsteps, and
                  then rose with extended hand,—</p>
               <p>"Theodore!" said she kindly. "I am very glad to see you; and so grown! You are
                  much taller than in the spring."</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am: I believe so. I don't think I shall grow much more," said Teddy,
                  swallowing a great bunch in his throat that almost suffocated him.</p>
               <p>"No? Why, you are not so very old, are you?" asked Mrs. Legrange, smiling a
                  little.</p>
               <p>"Nearly eighteen, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well! time enough for a good deal of growth, bodily and mental, yet. So you
                  have been at the West?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am, and have heard some curious things there,—some things that I think
                  will interest you. Have you ever thought of adopting a little girl, ma'am?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange sadly shook her head.</p>
               <p>"No, Theodore: I never wished to do that. She never could be any thing like
                     <emph>her</emph> to me, and it would seem like giving away her place. I had
                  rather wait."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, ma'am; for I saw a little girl, where I have been, that I was going
                  to speak of."</p>
               <p>"Was she a pretty child?"</p>
               <p>"Very pretty, and looked like"—</p>
               <p>"Theodore, don't say that, because I shall think either you have forgotten or
                  never learned her face. No child ever looked like her," said the mother
                  positively.</p>
               <p>"This little girl was very pretty though," persisted Teddy.</p>
               <p>"How did she look?"</p>
               <p>"She had great blue eyes (if you'll excuse, me, ma'am),<pb n="368-369"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000185"/> just like yours, with long brown eyelashes, and a
                  great deal of bright hair, not just brown, nor yet just golden, but between the
                  two; and a little mouth very much curved; and pretty teeth; and a delicate color;
                  and little hands with pretty finger-nails."</p>
               <p>"Theodore!"</p>
               <p>Teddy, for the first time in his description, dared to raise his eyes, but dropped
                  them again. He could not meet the anguish in those other eyes so earnestly fixed
                  upon him.</p>
               <p>"She was the adopted child of the people I visited in Iowa," faltered he.</p>
               <p>"Theodore!" said Mrs. Legrange again; and then, in a breathless fluttering
                  voice,—</p>
               <p>"Do not trifle with me; do not try to prepare my mind; and, oh! For God's sake, if
                  it is a false hope, say so this instant! Is she found?"</p>
               <p>"I think it may be so, dear Mrs. Legrange!"</p>
               <p>"No, but it is so! you know it! I see it in your eyes, I hear it in your voice!
                  You cannot hide it, you cannot deceive me! O my God! my God!—to thee the first
                  praise, the first thanks!"</p>
               <p>She fell upon her knees, her face upraised to heaven; and never mortal artist drew
                  such a picture of ecstatic praise. And though in after-years Theodore Ginniss
                  wandered through the galleries where the world conserves her rarest gems of art,
                  never did he find Madonna or Magdalen or saint to compare with the one picture his
                  memory treasured as the perfection of earthly loveliness, made radiant with the
                  purest heavenly bliss.</p>
               <p>"Now come!" exclaimed the mother, springing to her feet, and rapidly leading the
                  way along the narrow path. "You shall tell me all as we go."</p>
               <p>And the young man found it hard work to keep pace with the delicate woman, as she
                  flew rather than walked towards her child.</p>
               <p>"If you will wait here in your own room, I will bring her to you," said Teddy, as
                  he and Mrs. Legrange approached the hotel again.</p>
               <p>"Bring her! Where is she now? asked the mother, looking at him in dismay.</p>
               <p>"I left them at the other hotel, thinking, if I brought her directly here, we
                  might meet you before you were told," explained Teddy.</p>
               <p>"Who is with her?"</p>
               <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC5676-00000186"/>
               <p>"Dora Darling, the young lady who adopted her,—the one I told you of as living in
                  Iowa."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; and she has come all the way to bring my child to me! No, I cannot
                  wait: I will come with you."</p>
               <p>So Mr. Burroughs, still sitting upon the piazza, saw his cousin hastening by, and
                  came to join her.</p>
               <p>"Yes, come, Tom! come to—oh, to see Sunshine again!" and Mrs. Legrange turned her
                  flushed face away, to hide the hysterical agitation she could not quite
                  suppress.</p>
               <p>"Take my arm, Fanny; and do not walk so fast. You will hurt yourself," said Mr.
                  Burroughs kindly.</p>
               <p>"No, no: nothing can hurt me now. I must go fast: if I had wings, I should
                  fly!"</p>
               <p>"Here is the house. Will you wait in the parlor till I bring her down?" asked
                  Teddy, leading the way up the steps of the principal hotel at Yellow Springs.</p>
               <p>"No: take me to the room where they are waiting. I want to see her without
                  preparation," said Mrs. Legrange.</p>
               <p>So the whole party followed Teddy up the stairs to a door, where he paused and
                  knocked. A low voice said,—</p>
               <p>"Come in!" and the opening door showed Dora seated upon a low chair, with Sunshine
                  clasped in her arms, and fast asleep. She made a motion to rise upon seeing the
                  visitors; but Mrs. Legrange, lifting her finger as imploring silence softly
                  advanced, and bent with clasped hands and eager eyes over the sleeping child.
                  Then, with the graceful instinct of a woman who knows and pities the wound in the
                  heart of her less fortunate rival, she put her arms about Dora and the child,
                  embracing both, and pressed her lips lightly upon Dora's cheek, devouringly upon
                  Sunshine's lips.</p>
               <p>Dora started as if she had been stung, and a sudden tremor crossed the rigid calm
                  of her demeanor. She had schooled herself to indifference, to neglect or to civil
                  thanks worse than either: but this unexpected tenderness, this sisterly
                  recognition, went straight through all its defences to her quivering heart; and
                  she looked up piteously into the lovely face bent over her, whispering,—</p>
               <p>"I am so glad you have found her! but I have nothing left half so dear."</p>
               <p>There was no reply; for Sunshine, without sound or movement, suddenly opened her
                  eyes, and fixed them upon her mother's face, while deep in their blue depths grew
                  a glad smile, breaking at last, like a veritable sungleam, all over her face, as,
                  holding out her arms, she eagerly said,—</p>
               <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC5676-00000187"/>
               <p>"I've come to heaven while I was asleep; and you're the angel that loves me so
                  dearly well. I know you by your eyes."</p>
               <p>"The mother clasped her own,—as who shall blame her?—and Dora's arms and Dora's
                  heart were empty, robbed of the nestling they had cherished,—empty, as she said to
                  herself, turning from the sight of that maternal bliss, of the best love she had
                  ever known, or could ever hope.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs, who liked character-reading, watched her narrowly; and when,
                  presently, the whole party returned to Mrs. Legrange's hotel, he quietly walked
                  beside Dora, lingering a little, and detaining her out of hearing of Mrs. Legrange
                  and Teddy, who walked on with Sunshine between them.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Is</emph> virtue its own reward, Miss Dora?" asked he abruptly, when almost
                  half the distance between the two hotels was passed.</p>
               <p>Dora looked at him a little puzzled; and then, as she read the half-sympathizing,
                  half-mocking expression of his face, answered,—</p>
               <p>"You mean I am not happy in bringing Sunshine back to her mother; don't you?"</p>
               <p>"Exactly; and you told me once that no one ought to be rewarded for doing what is
                  right, because it is reward enough to know that we are doing right."</p>
               <p>"And so it is. I don't want any reward," said Dora rather hastily.</p>
               <p>"No: but, if young Ginniss had not discovered the identity of the child, my cousin
                  would not have been unhappier than she has been for two years; and you—would you
                  not be at this moment better content with life?"</p>
               <p>Dora's clear eyes looked straight into his as she wonderingly asked,—</p>
               <p>"Do you want me to say I am sorry Mrs. Legrange has found her child?"</p>
               <p>"If it is true, yes; and I know you will," replied Mr. Burroughs quietly.</p>
               <p>"And so I would," said Dora, in the same tone; "but it is not true. I am glad, not
                  happy, but very glad, that Sunshine has come to her mother at last,—her heaven, as
                  she calls it. I do not deny that my own heart is very sore, and that I cannot yet
                  think of her not being my child any more, without"—</p>
               <p>She turned away her head, and Mr. Burroughs looked at her yet more attentively
                  than he had been looking.</p>
               <p>"But, if you could, you would not go back, and arrange<pb n="374-375"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000188"/> it that Teddy should not come to your house? Word
                  and honor now, Dora."</p>
               <p>"Word and honor, Mr. Burroughs, I surely would not. Can you doubt me?"</p>
               <p>"No, Dora, I do not; but, in your place, I should doubt myself."</p>
               <p>Dora looked at him with a frank smile.</p>
               <p>"I would trust you in this place, or any other," said she simply.</p>
               <p>"Would you, would you really, Dora?" asked Tom Burroughs eagerly, while a slight
                  color flashed into his handsome face. "Why would you?"</p>
               <p>"Because I feel sure you could never do any thing mean or ungenerous, or feel any
                  way but nobly"—</p>
               <p>She paused suddenly, and a tide of crimson suffused her face and neck. Mr.
                  Burroughs, with the heroism of perfect breeding, turned away his eyes, and
                  suppressed the enthusiastic answer that had risen to his lips. He would not add to
                  her confusion by accepting as extraordinary the impulsive expression of her
                  feelings. So he simply said, after a moment of silence,—</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Dora. I hope you may never have occasion to regret your noble
                  confidence."</p>
               <p>Dora did not answer, but hastened her steps, until she walked close behind Mrs.
                  Legrange; nor did her companion speak again, although, could Dora have read his
                  thoughts, she might have found in them matter of more interest than any words he
                  had ever spoken to her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">WHAT DORA SAID.</head>
               <p>IT had been Dora's intention to return to Iowa immediately after leaving Sunshine
                  in charge of her own friends; but Mrs. Legrange insisted so urgently upon her
                  remaining with them for some weeks at least, and the parting with the dear child
                  she had so loved and cherished seemed so cruel as it drew nearer and nearer, that
                  she finally consented to remain for a short time, and removed to the Neff House,
                  where Mrs. Legrange had engaged rooms until the first of October.</p>
               <p>To other natures than those called to encounter it, the relation between these
                  three might, for a time at least, have been painful and perplexing; but Mrs.
                  Legrange was possessed of such exquisite tact, Sunshine of such abounding and at
                  the same time delicate affections, and Dora of such a noble and generous temper,
                  that they could not but harmonize: and while 'Toinette bloomed, flower-like, into
                  new and wonderful beauty bathed in the sunlight of a double love, Mrs. Legrange
                  never forgot to associate Dora with herself as its source. And Dora joyed in her
                  darling's joy; and, if her heart ached at thought of the coming loneliness, the
                  pain expressed itself no otherwise than in an added tenderness.</p>
               <p>"That is a noble girl, Fanny," said Mr. Burroughs one day. "How different from our
                  dear five hundred friends at home! Put Mary Elmsly, or Lizzy Patterson, or Miss
                  Bloomsleigh, or Marion Lee, in her place, and how would they fill it?"</p>
               <p>"She is, indeed, a noble girl," replied his cousin warmly. "I never shall forget
                  the tender and wise care she has taken of Sunshine in this last year. She has
                  strengthened heart and principle as I am afraid I could never have done."</p>
               <p>"Paul is coming out for you, isn't he?" pursued Mr. Burroughs after a pause.</p>
               <p>"Yes: he will be here by the 20th. Why did you ask?"</p>
               <p>"Because Dora cannot travel home alone, and I think of accompanying her. I may
                  stay a while, and study prairie life."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange looked at him in surprise a moment;<pb n="378-379"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000190"/> and then a merry smile broke over her face, for
                  such a smile was possible now to her.</p>
               <p>"Capital!" exclaimed she. "I never thought of it. But why not?"</p>
               <p>"Why not spend a few weeks in Iowa? Well, of course, why not?" asked Mr. Burroughs
                  a little grimly, and presently added,—</p>
               <p>"That is a pernicious custom of yours Fanny,—that rushing at conclusions."</p>
               <p>"Men never rush at conclusions, do they?"</p>
               <p>"No: of course not."</p>
               <p>"Very well, then: arrive at your conclusion as leisurely as you like. It is none
                  the less certain."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" remarked Mr. Burroughs; and as his cousin laughingly turned to bend over
                  Sunshine, and help her read her story-book, he took his hat and went out, turning
                  his steps toward the glen.</p>
               <p>Not till he reached its deepest recesses, however, did he find Dora; and then he
                  stood still to look at her, himself unseen. But what a white, dumb look of anguish
                  upon the sweet face! what clouds, heavy with coming showers, upon the brow! what
                  rainy lights in the upturned eyes! what a resistless sorrow in the downward curve
                  of the lips, ordinarily so firm and cheerful! Even the shapely hands, tightly
                  folded, and firmly set upon the knee, told their story,—even the rigid lines and
                  constrained attitude of the figure. Mr. Burroughs's first impulse was artistic;
                  and he longed to be a sculptor, that he might model an immortal statue of Silent
                  Grief. The second was human; and he longed to comfort a sorrow at whose cause he
                  already guessed, and yet guessed but half. The third was less creditable, but
                  perhaps as probable, in a man of Mr. Burroughs's temperament and education; for it
                  was to study and dissect this new phase of the young girl's character. He quietly
                  approached, and seated himself beside her with a commonplace remark,—</p>
               <p>"A very pretty bit of scenery, Dora."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied she, struggling to resume her usual demeanor.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, however, it does not satisfy your eye, accustomed to the breadth of
                  prairie views. Confess that you are a little weary of it and us, and longing for
                  home."</p>
               <p>"I shall probably set out for home to-morrow," said Dora, turning away her head,
                  and playing idly with the grass beside her.</p>
               <p>"I thought you were homesick. I am sorry we have so ill succeeded in contenting
                  you."</p>
               <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC5676-00000191"/>
               <p>"Oh, don't think that! I have been so happy here these two weeks! That is the very
                  reason I ought to go."</p>
               <p>"How is that? I don't see the argument."</p>
               <p>"Because this is not my home, or the way I am to live, or these the people I am to
                  live with; and the sooner I am away, the better."</p>
               <p>She did not see all the meaning of her words, poor child! but her companion did,
                  and smiled merrily to himself as he said,—</p>
               <p>"You mean, we do not come up to your standard, and you cannot waste more time upon
                  us; don't you?"</p>
               <p>Dora turned and looked at him, her suspicions roused by a mocking ring beneath the
                  affected humility of his tone; and, looking, she caught the covert smile not yet
                  faded from his eyes.</p>
               <p>"It is not kind, Mr. Burroughs, to laugh at me, or to try to confuse me in this
                  way," said she steadily. "No doubt, you know what I mean; and why do you wish to
                  force me into saying, that the more I see of the life and thoughts and manners of
                  such people as Mrs. Legrange and you, and even my own little Sunshine, now so far
                  away from me, the less fit I feel to associate with them? And, just because it is
                  so pleasant to me, I feel that I ought to go back at once to the home and the
                  duties and the people where I belong. I am but a poor country-girl, sir, hardly
                  taught in any thing except the love of God, and the wish to do something before I
                  die to make my fellow-creatures a little happier or more comfortable than I find
                  them. Let me go to my work, and out of it I will make my life."</p>
               <p>Perhaps never had the self-contained heart of the young girl so framed itself in
                  words; certainly never had Mr. Burroughs so fully read it: and when she finished,
                  and, neither turning from him nor toward him, steadfastly set her eyes forward, as
                  one who sees mapped out before him the path he is to tread through all the coming
                  years, he took her hand in his with a sudden impulse of tenderness,—</p>
               <p>"Dora, you will love some one yet; and love will make you happy."</p>
               <p>"I have loved two people, and lost them both. I do not mean to love any one else,"
                  said Dora, quietly withdrawing her hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs stared at her in astonishment; and, with a directness more natural
                  than conventional, exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"You have loved twice already!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Three times, indeed. I loved my mother and Picter, and they are both dead. I
                  loved Sunshine and she<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC5676-00000192"/> is lost to me. O
                  my little Sunshine! who was all to me, and who, I thought"—</p>
               <p>And then—oh rare result of all these days of suffering, and hidden bitterness, and
                  a lingering relinquishment of the sweet and tender hope of her future life!—Dora
                  gave way all at once, and, covering her face with her hands, burst into a passion
                  of tears; such tears as women seldom weep; such tears as Dora herself had shed but
                  two or three times in her short life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burroughs sat for a moment, looking at her with a yearning tenderness in his
                  eyes, and then folded her suddenly in his arms, whispering,—</p>
               <p>"Dora, Dora Darling! I love you, and I will be to you more than all these; and no
                  time nor chance shall rob you of my love, if only you will give me yours
                  instead."</p>
               <p>But Dora repulsed him vehemently, sobbing, "No, no, no! you shall not say it! I
                  will not hear it!"</p>
               <p>"Not say it? Why not? It is God's truth; and you must have known it before
                  to-day."</p>
               <p>"No: it is only pity, because you think I want to stay, and because— No, I will
                  not have it! I will not hear it! You are quite wrong, Mr. Burroughs: you do not
                  know"—</p>
               <p>She stopped in confusion. She had done sobbing now; but she did not uncover her
                  face, or look up. Mr. Burroughs regarded her with a strange expression, and then,
                  taking her hand, said softly,—</p>
               <p>"Dora, I have not dared, as you fear that I have, to fancy that you cared for me.
                  A moment ago, I should not have dared to ask you as I now do; and remember, Dora,
                  that I ask for the solemn truth,—do you love me?"</p>
               <p>Dora tore away her hand indignantly, and attempted to rise. She had not spoken, or
                  looked at him. Over the pale face of the lover shot a gleam of triumph. But he
                  only said,—</p>
               <p>"Dora, it will not be like you to leave me in this way. It is unjust and
                  untrue."</p>
               <p>"It is you who are unkind and ungenerous," said the girl passionately.</p>
               <p>"Why, Dora? Why is it ungenerous to ask for a confession of your love, when I have
                  already told you that all my heart is in your hands?"</p>
               <p>"You fancied that I—that I—liked you; and you knew I did not want to go home, and
                  you pitied me: and I won't have it, sir. I do not need pity, and I do not"—</p>
               <p>Her voice died away, killed by the falsehood she could not speak. Mr. Burroughs no
                  longer pressed for an answer<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC5676-00000193"/> to the
                  question he had asked, but grasped at a new argument.</p>
               <p>"Pity and kindness!" sadly repeated he. "Dora, if you only knew how much more I
                  stand in need of your pity than you of mine, if you only knew what kindness your
                  life has already done mine, you would not treat me in this manner."</p>
               <p>"You need my pity!" exclaimed Dora, forgetting herself, and turning to look at him
                  in naïve astonishment; "and for what?"</p>
               <p>"For a purposeless and weary life; for an empty heart and a corroded faith," said
                  her lover bitterly; "for an indifference to men, amounting almost to aversion; for
                  a trifling estimate of women, amounting almost to contempt; for wasted abilities
                  and neglected opportunities,—for all these, Dora, I need your pity, and have a
                  right to claim it: for it is only since I loved you that I have recognized my own
                  great needs and deficiencies. Complete the work you have unconsciously begun,
                  dearest. Reverse the fairy fable, and let the beautiful princess come to waken
                  with her kiss the slothful prince, who else might sleep forever."</p>
               <p>"How can you know so soon that I am the princess?" asked Dora shyly.</p>
               <p>"So soon! I felt the truth stirring blindly in my heart that first night, now a
                  year ago, when I saw you in the old home, and read your candid eyes, and heard
                  your clear voice, and marked your steady and serene influence upon all about you.
                  I hardly knew it then; but, when I was away from you, I was myself surprised to
                  find how vivid your impression upon my mind remained. When my cousin asked me to
                  accompany her here, I silently resolved, that, before I returned home, I would see
                  you again; would study as deeply as I might the character I already guessed. Then,
                  Dora, when I saw you, as I have seen you in these last weeks, struggling so nobly
                  to render complete the sacrifice you came hither to make; when I saw the
                  sweetness, the power, the loftiness, and the divine truth, of your nature, shining
                  more clearly day by day, and yourself the only one unconscious of the priceless
                  value of such a nature,—then, Dora, I came to know for truth what I tell you now,
                  God hearing me, that you are the woman of all the world whom I love, honor, and
                  undeservingly long to make my own. Once more, Dora,—and you cannot now refuse to
                  answer me at least,—once more I ask, do you or can you love me?"</p>
               <p>He grasped her hands in both his own, and his keen eyes<pb n="386-387"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000194"/> read her very soul. She raised hers as steadily to
                  meet them; and, though the hot blush seemed to scorch her very brow, she
                  answered,—</p>
               <p>"I did not know it, quite, until to-day; but I believe—I think—I have cared about
                  you ever since a year ago. That is, not love; but every one else seemed less than
                  they had been: and since I knew you here, and since I thought I must go home, and
                  never see you any more, it was"—</p>
               <p>She faltered and stopped, drooping her head before the tender triumph of his
                  glance. Truth had asserted herself, as with Dora she must have done in any stress,
                  but now of a sudden found herself silenced by a timidity as charming as it was new
                  in the strong and well poised temperament of the girl who, a moment before so
                  brave, now stood trembling and blushing beneath her lover's gaze.</p>
               <p>He drew her to his breast, and pressed his lips to hers.</p>
               <p>"Dora, my own wife!" whispered he. "God so deal with me here and hereafter as I
                  with you, the best gift in his mighty hand!"</p>
               <p>And Dora, hiding her face upon his breast, whispered again,—</p>
               <p>"I was so unhappy an hour ago! and now, as Sunshine, says, I have come to heaven
                  all at once!" </p>
               <p>Her lover answered by a mute caress; for there are moments when words are all too
                  weak for speech. And so he only clasped her closer in his arms, and bent his head
                  upon her own; while all about them the hundred voices of the summer noon whispered
                  benediction on their joy; the eddying stream paused in its whirl to dimple into
                  laughter at their feet; the sunlight, broken and flecked by the waving branches,
                  fell in a shifting golden shower upon their heads; and Nature, the great mother,
                  through her myriad eyes and tongues, blessed the betrothal of her dearest
                  child.</p>

               <head type="sub">A SURPRISE FOR MRS. GINNISS.</head>
               <p>"SURE an' it's time they was a-coomin'," said Mrs. Ginniss going out upon the
                  door-stone, and shading her eyes from the level rays of the sunset as she looked
                  steadfastly down the road.</p>
               <p>"An' who'll they all be, I'm woondherin'? The missus says fove bids was wanted;
                  an' faith it's well she said no more, for sorra a place 'ud there be to stand
                  anudder in. An' tay ready for eight folks, at sax o'clock. That's it, I belave;
                  though all thim figgers is enough to craze me poor head."</p>
               <p>She took a little note from her pocket as she spoke, and, unfolding it, looked
                  anxiously at the delicate letters.</p>
               <p>"Sure an' it's all there if on'y I had the sinse to rade it. An' feth, it's the
                  tail uv it I'm howldin' to the top, as I'm a sinner! No' thin: it looks as crabbed
                  this way as that. I'd niver be afther makin' it out if it towld of a fortin
                  coomin' to me for the axin'. Shusin, Shusin, I say!"</p>
               <p>"What is it, Mrs. Ginniss?" asked a pleasant voice from within; and Susan, looking
                  a little thinner and paler than when we first met her, came out of the parlor,
                  where she had been picking a few scattered petals from beneath the vases of
                  flowers upon the mantle-shelf.</p>
               <p>"An' would ye be plazed to read the missus's note to me wonst more? Me owld eyes
                  are that dim, I can't make it out in the gloamin'."</p>
               <p>Susan, with unshaken gravity, took the note, turned it right side up, and read
                  aloud, while her companion craftily glanced over her shoulder to note the position
                  of the words as they were spoken:—</p>

               <p>"One's a carryall, and the other's a rockaway," said Susan sententiously.</p>
               <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC5676-00000196"/>
               <p>"Musha, an' what's the odds if they're one thing or the other, so they bring the

                  her white bonnet with the blue ribbon."</p>
               <p>"Yes, there's Mr. and Mrs. Legrange, and a strange lady and gentleman; and the
                  other carriage are all strangers, except Mr. Burroughs. Those young ladies are
                  pretty; ain't they?"</p>
               <p>But Mrs. Ginniss was already at the gate, courtesying and beaming:—</p>
               <p>"Ye're wilcoom home, missus and masther; an' it's in health an' pace I hope yees
                  coom."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Ginniss. We are very well indeed, I believe," said Mr. Legrange,
                  rather nervously, as he jumped from the carriage and helped out his wife, and then
                  Kitty and Mr. Brown. From the other carriage, meantime, had alighted, without the
                  good woman's observation, Mr. Burroughs, Dora, Karl, and another, who, the moment
                  her feet touched the ground, ran forward, crying,—</p>
               <p>"O mamma! I've been at this home before."</p>
               <p>At the sound, Mrs. Ginniss turned, dropping the shawls, bags, and parasols she
                  held, in one mass at her feet, and then dropping herself upon her knees in their
                  midst; while her fresh face turned of a ghastly yellow, and her uplifted hands
                  shook visibly,—</p>
               <p>"Glory be to God, an' what's that!" exclaimed she in a voice of terror.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's mammy, it's mammy! that used to rock me in her lap, and hold my feet,
                  and sing to me! I 'member her now, and Teddy said so too. O mammy! I'm so glad
                  you've come again!"</p>
               <p>The sobbing woman opened wide her arms; and Sunshine leaped into them, shouting
                  again and again,—</p>
               <p>"It's the good old mammy! and I'm so glad, I'm so glad!"</p>
               <p>"O Mrs. Legrange! is it?" exclaimed an agitated voice; and Mrs. Legrange, turning,
                  found Susan standing beside her with pale face and clasped hands, her eyes fixed
                  upon the child with a sort of terror.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Susan, it is 'Toinette, her very self. I would not write, because I wanted
                  to see if she would know you both, and you her."</p>
               <p>"Oh, thank God! thank God! I didn't believe I'd ever forgive myself for not
                  minding her better; but now I may. Miss 'Toinette, dear, won't you speak to
                  Susan?"</p>
               <p>"Susan!" exclaimed the child, struggling out of Mrs.<pb n="392-393"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000197"/> Ginniss's embrace, and leaving that good woman
                  still exploding in a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">feu-de-joie</foreign> of
                  thanksgiving, emotion, and astonishment. "Are you Susan? Why, that was a
                  doll!"</p>
               <p>"A doll?" asked the nurse in bewilderment, and pausing in act of kissing her
                  recovered charge, not with the rapturous abandonment of the Irish woman, but with
                  the respectful tenderness of a trained English servant.</p>
               <p>"She named a doll after you, Mrs. Ginniss says, although she did not remember who
                  you really were," explained Mrs. Legrange. "But come, my friends: we will not wait
                  longer out of doors. Dora, you and Kitty know the way even better than I; and Mr.
                  Windsor"—</p>
               <p>"It isn't Mr. Windsor, it's Karlo, mamma," persisted Sunshine, dancing up the
                  narrow path in advance of the party.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Karl, if you will be so kind," said Dr. Windsor, offering Mrs. Legrange his
                  arm.</p>
               <p>"Then Karl will feel himself as much at home here as he ever did, I trust," said
                  the lady cordially.</p>
               <p>"It was peeping out at that window I saw you first, Dora; and I thought it must be
                  the sunrise," whispered Tom Burroughs to the lady he escorted.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry I should have so put you out of countenance. Perhaps that is the
                  reason you never have seen straight since,—so far as I am concerned at least,"
                  replied she.</p>
               <p>"One does not care to look straight at the sun: it is sufficient to bask in its
                  light," whispered the lover.</p>
               <p>"Oh! very well, if that is what you want— Here, Sunshine! Cousin Tom wants
                  you."</p>
               <p>The little girl came bounding toward them; and Dora, with a wicked little laugh,
                  slipped away, and up the stairs, to the room that had been Kitty's, now
                  appropriated to the use of the two young girls.</p>
               <p>Soon the happy party assembled again in the kitchen, where stood a tea-table
                  judiciously combining the generous breadth of Mrs. Ginniss's ideas with the more
                  elegant and subdued tastes inculcated upon Susan by a long period of service with
                  her present mistress.</p>
               <p>"Mind you tell 'em there's more beyant, on'y you wouldn't set it on all to wonst,"
                  whispered the Irish woman hoarsely, as she rushed into the scullery, leaving Susan
                  to receive the guests just entering the kitchen.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Ginniss thought we should arrive with appetites, I suspect," said the
                  hostess, laughing a little apologetically<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC5676-00000198"
                  /> as they seated themselves; and Susan did not think it best to deliver her
                  message.</p>
               <p>"And so we have, some of us at least; and I do not believe even the ladies will
                  refuse a bit of this nice tongue, or some cold chicken. What do you say, Dora?"
                  asked Mr. Legrange gayly.</p>
               <p>"No tongue for her, please; she is supplied," remarked Mr. Burroughs <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce</foreign>; and Dora, with a little mutinous glance,
                  passed her plate with,—</p>
               <p>"A slice of tongue, if you please, Mr. Legrange."</p>
               <p>"Never mind: wait a few days, and we will see," murmured Burroughs threateningly;
                  and Dora did not care to retort, but, blushing brightly, began an eager
                  conversation with Sunshine, who had nestled a chair in between those of her mother
                  and Dora, and made lively claims upon the attention of both.</p>
               <p>An hour or two later, Mrs. Legrange went to seek her housekeeper, and found her
                  seated upon the step of the back door, her hands clasped around her knees, and
                  softly crooning a wild Irish melody to herself as she rocked slowly backward and
                  forward, her eyes fixed upon the little crescent moon, swimming like a silver boat
                  in the golden sea of sunset.</p>
               <p>"An' isn't it a purty sight, you?" asked she, rising as Mrs. Legrange spoke to
                  her. "Sure an' its the hooney-moon for Misther Booros an' the swate young lady
                  that's to marry him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it's their honey-moon; and I believe it will be as bright and as long a one
                  as ever shone," said Mrs. Legrange, smiling tenderly, as happy wives will do in
                  speaking of the future of a bride.</p>
               <p>"I came to ask you to go up stairs with me, Mrs. Ginniss," continued she with a
                  little agitation in her sweet voice. "There is something for you to see."</p>
               <p>"Sure an' I will, ma'am. Is it the chambers isn't settled to shute yees?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! every thing is admirable, except that we must contrive a little bed for
                  'Toinette upon the couch in my room."</p>
               <p>"An' faith, that's asy done, ma'am. There's lashin's o' blankets an' sheets an'
                  pillers not in use at all, at all. We've plenty uv ivery thin' in this house,
                  glory be to God!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange smiled a little at the satisfaction with which the Irish woman
                  contemplated a superfluity, even when not belonging to herself; and led the way to
                     her<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC5676-00000199"/> own chamber, where sat Dora, as
                  she had sat many a time within those four walls, holding Sunshine upon her lap,
                  and, while loosening her clothes for the night, telling her one of the stories of
                  which the child was never weary.</p>
               <p>"See here, Mrs. Ginniss!" said the mother hastily, as she stripped the frock from
                  the child's white shoulders, and showed a little linen bag hung about her neck by
                  a silken cord. "Did you ever see that before?"</p>
               <p>"Sure an' what would ail me owld eyes not to seen it, whin me own fingers sewed
                  it, an' me own han's hoong it aboot the little crather's nick?"</p>
               <p>"You are quite sure it is the very same?"</p>
               <p>"Quite an' intirely; for more by token the clot' is a bit uv the linen gownd that
                  my mother give me whin I wor married to Michael, an' the sthring wor to a locket
                  that my b'y give me one Christmas Day."</p>
               <p>"And what is in it?" asked Mrs. Legrange eagerly.</p>
               <p>"The bracelet, uv coorse. Whin Teddy brought her to me the black night he foun'
                  her sinseless in the strate, she had it clinched in the little hand uv her; an',
                  whin she got betther, there wor nought she loved so well to have by her, an'
                  tooch, an' look at. So when she roomed about, an' I wor thinkin' it might be laid
                  asthray, or she might lave it out the windy, or some place, an' not find it, I
                  sewed it in the bit bag, an' placed it round her nick, and bid her niver, niver,
                  niver let it be took off till she coom to her own agin.</p>
               <p>"'That manes hivin, mammy, don't it?' axed the darlint in her own purty way; an'
                  so I says, 'Yis, that manes hivin; an' don't ye niver be lettin' man, woman, nor
                  child, be knowin' to it, till ye git to hivin'.' For sure I knowed she must be
                  some person's child that 'ud one day give their hearts out uv their buzzums to
                  know for sure that she wor their own."</p>
               <p>"And that is the reason she never would let me look at it, or open it," said Dora.
                  "She always said, when I asked about it, that it was to go to heaven with her;
                  and, when she got there, she'd open it. So I supposed it was a charm or relic,
                  such as some of our soldiers used to carry about their necks; and I never meddled
                  with it."</p>
               <p>"And I, although I knew what it must be, wanted to hear Mrs. Ginniss say that it
                  was the very same bag and all, that she put about the darling's neck soon after
                  she went to her. But now"—</p>
               <p>The quick snip of the scissors finished the sentence, and the bag lay in Mrs.
                  Legrange's palm. Sunshine's little<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC5676-00000200"/> hand
                  went up rather forlornly to her bosom, robbed of what it so long had cherished;
                  and Dora clasped her tighter, and kissed her tenderly: but neither spoke, until
                  Mrs. Legrange drew from the bag, and held before them, the coral bracelet, with
                  its linked cameos, broken at one point by the force with which Mother Winch had
                  torn it from the child's shoulder, and with the clasp still closed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Legrange opened it, touched the spring, causing the upper plate to fly up,
                  and silently showed to Dora the name "Antoinette Legrange" engraved within.</p>
               <p>"Not quite two years since it was engraved, and what a life of sorrow!" said she
                  softly.</p>
               <p>Then, going to her jewel-case, she took out the mate, saved as a sacred relic
                  since the day it had been found upon the floor in the drawing-room after
                  'Toinette's flight, and handed it to the child, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Here is the other one, darling; and you may, if you like, give it to Dora for
                  your wedding-present. This one, that has showed the wanderings of my poor little
                  lost lamb so long, I shall keep for myself."</p>
               <p>"Will you take it, Dora, and some love, ever so much love, along with it?" said
                  Sunshine, trying to make her little offering in somewhat the form she had heard
                  from older people, but finishing with a sudden clasp of her arms about Dora's
                  neck, and a shower of kisses, among which came the whispered words,—</p>
               <p>"I love you ever and ever so much better than Cousin Tom does, Dora. Be my little
                  wife, and never mind him; won't you?"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE WEDDING-DAY.</head>
               <p>"MAKE haste, Mr. Sun, and get up! Don't you know it is my birthday, and, what is
                  better, it is Dora's wedding-day? So jump up, pretty Sunny, and be just as bright
                  as glory all day long!"</p>
               <p>And the sun, hearing the appeal, stood suddenly upon the summit of the distant
                  hills, shooting playful golden arrows into the child's merry eyes, and among her
                  floating hair, where they clung glittering and glancing; while to her mind he
                  seemed to say,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, little namesake! I know all about it; and I promise you sha'n't find me
                  backward in doing my share towards the entertainment. As for a glare of light,
                  though, I know a trick worth two of that, as you shall see. But, first, here is my
                  birthday-kiss. Don't you feel it warm upon your lips?"</p>
               <p>"O papa!" shouted Sunshine, as the fancy whirled through her busy little brain,
                  "it seems just as if the sun were kissing me for my birthday."</p>
               <p>"If the sun does, the father must; and it ought to be twice over, because last
                  year he lost the chance. Eight! Bless me! where shall I put them all? One on the
                  forehead, two on the eyes, one on the tip of that ridiculous little nose, two on
                  the rose-red cheeks, one in that little hollow under the chin, and the last and
                  best square on the lips. Now, then, my Sunshine, run to mamma, who is waiting for
                  you."</p>
               <p>The sun meantime, after a brief period of meditation, took his resolve; and,
                  sending back the brisk October day that had prepared to descend upon earth, he
                  summoned, instead, the first day of the Indian Summer, and bade her go and help to
                  celebrate the bridal of one of his favorite daughters, as she knew so well how to
                  do.</p>
               <p>So, summoning a south-west wind, still bearing in his garments the odors of the
                  tropic bowers where he had slept, the fair day descended softly in his arms to
                  earth, and, seating herself upon the hills, wove a drapery of golden mist, bright
                  as love, and tender as maidenhood. Then, wrapped in this bridal veil, she floated,
                  still in the arms of the gentle wind, through the forests, touching their
                     leaves<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC5676-00000202"/> with purer gold and richer
                  crimson; over the harvest-fields, whose shocks of lingering corn rustled
                  responsive as her trailing garments swept past; over wide, brown pastures, where
                  the cattle nibbled luxuriously at the sweet after-math; over lakes and rivers,
                  where the waters slept content, forgetting, for the moment, their restless seaward
                  march; over sheltered gardens, where hollyhock and sunflower, petunia and pansy,
                  dahlia and phlox, whispering together of the summer vanished and the frosty nights
                  at hand, gave out the mysterious, melancholy perfume of an autumn day.</p>
               <p>And from forest and field, and pasture and garden, and from the sleeping waters,
                  the dreamy day culled the beauty and the grace, the perfume and the sweet content,
                  and, floating on to where the bride awaited her coming, dropped them all, a
                  heavenly dower, upon her head; wrapped the bright veil caressingly about her; and
                  so passed on, to lie reclined upon the hills, dreaming in luxurious beauty, until
                  the night should come, and she should float once more heavenward.</p>
               <p>But the south-west wind lingered a while, kissing the trembling lips of the bride,
                  fanning her burning cheek, and dallying with the floating tresses of her hair;
                  then, whispering pering farewell, he crept away to hide in the recesses of the
                  wood, and sigh himself to sleep.</p>
               <p>"Dora, where are you, love? Do you hide from me today?" called a voice; and Dora,
                  peeping round the stem of the old oak at whose foot she sat, said shyly,—</p>
               <p>"Do you want me, Tom?"</p>
               <p>"Want you, my darling? What else on earth do I want but you? And how lovely you
                  are to-day, Dora! You never looked like this before."</p>
               <p>"It never was my wedding-day before," whispered Dora; and, like the summer day and
                  the west wind, we will pass on, leaving these our lovers to their own fond folly,
                  which yet is such wisdom as the philosophers and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >savans</foreign> can never give us by theory or diagram.</p>
               <p>As the fair day waned to sunset, they were married; Mr. Brown saying the solemn
                  words that barred from his own heart even the unrequited love that had been a
                  dreary solace to it. But Mr. Brown was not only a good man, but a strong man, and
                  one of an iron determination; and so it was possible to him to say those words
                  unfalteringly, and to look upon the bride—lovelier in her misty robes of white,
                  and floating veil, than he had ever seen her before—with unfaltering eyes and
                  unchanging color. No great<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC5676-00000203"/> effort stops
                  short at the end for which it was exerted; and the chaplain himself was surprised
                  to find how calm his heart could be, and how little of pain or regret mingled with
                  his honest admiration and affection for Thomas Burroughs's wife.</p>
               <p>The carriage stood ready in the lane, and in another hour they were gone; and let
                  us say with Mrs. Ginniss,—radiant in her new cap and gown,—</p>
               <p>"The blissing of God go with 'em! fur it's thimsilves as desarves it."</p>
               <p>To those who remain behind when an absorbing interest is suddenly withdrawn, all
                  ordinary events seem to have lost their connection with themselves, and to be
                  dull, disjointed, and fatiguing.</p>
               <p>Perhaps that was the reason why Kitty, as soon as the bridal party was out of
                  sight, crept away to her own chamber, and cried as if her heart would break; but
                  nothing except the natural love of mischief, inherent in even the sweetest of
                  children, could have tempted 'Toinette, after visiting her, to go straight to Mr.
                  Brown,—strolling in the rambling old garden,—and say,—</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Brown! did you say that you despised Kitty?"</p>
               <p>"Despise Kitty! Certainly not, my dear. What made you think of such a thing?"</p>
               <p>"Why, she said so. She's up in our room, crying just as hard! And, when I asked
                  her what was the matter, she hugged me up tight, and said nobody cared for her,
                  and nobody would ever love her same as Cousin Tom does Dora. And I told her, yes,
                  they would, and maybe you would; and then she said, 'Oh, no, no, no! he despises
                  me!' and then she cried harder than ever. Tell her you don't; won't you, Mr.
                  Brown?"</p>
               <p>The chaplain looked much disturbed, and then very thoughtful; but, as the child
                  still urged him with her entreaties, he said,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will tell her so, Sunshine, but not just now. And mind you this, little
                  girl,—you must never, never let Kitty know that you told me what she said. Will
                  you promise?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'll promise. I guess you're afraid, if she knows, she'll think you just say
                  so to make her feel happy. Isn't that it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes: that is just it. So remember!"</p>
               <p>"I'll 'memberer. Oh, there's Karlo! I'm going to look for chestnuts with him
                  to-morrow. Good-by, Mr. Brown!"</p>
               <p>"Good-by, little Sunshine!"</p>
               <pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC5676-00000204"/>
               <p>And, for a good hour, Mr. Brown, pacing up and down the garden-walk, took counsel
                  with his own heart, and, we may hope, found it docile.</p>
               <p>The next day, he said to Kitty,—</p>
               <p>"I have been telling your brother that he had better let you board at Yellow
                  Springs this winter, and attend the lectures at the college. Should you like
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, ever so much!" exclaimed Kitty eagerly. "But we were to keep house together
                  at Outpost."</p>
               <p>"Karl thinks it will be as well to shut up the house and leave farm-matters to
                  Seth and Mehitable, until spring, when Mr. and Mrs. Burroughs return. He will
                  prefer for himself to spend the winter in Greenfield, perhaps in Dr. Gershom's
                  family. If you are at Antioch College, I can perhaps help you with your studies. I
                  take some private pupils."</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown did not make this proposition with his usual fluency. Indeed, he was
                  embarrassed to a considerable extent; and so, no doubt, was Kitty, who answered
                  confusedly,—</p>
               <p>"I could try; but I never shall be fit for any thing. I never—I never shall know
                  much; though, if you will try to teach me"—</p>
               <p>"I will try, Kitty, with all my heart. You have excellent abilities, and it is
                  foolish to say you 'never can be fit' for almost any position."</p>
               <p>"O Mr. Brown! it seems to me as if I was such a poor sort of creature, compared
                  with almost any one!"</p>
               <p>"Dora, for instance?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I never can be Dora: now, could I?"</p>
               <p>"No, any more than I could be Mr. Burroughs. But perhaps Kitty Windsor and Frank
                  Brown may fill their places in this world, and the next too, as well as these
                  friends of theirs whom they both admire."</p>
               <p>"O Mr. Brown! will you help me?" asked Kitty, turning involuntarily toward him,
                  and raising her handsome dark eyes and glowing face to his. He took her hands,
                  looked kindly into her eyes, and said both tenderly and solemnly,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, Kitty, God helping me, I will be to you all that a thoughtful brother could
                  be to his only sister; and, what you may be to me in the dim future, that future
                  only knows."</p>
               <p>And Kitty's eyes drooped happily beneath that earnest gaze, and upon her cheeks
                  glowed the dawn of a hope as vague as it was sweet.</p>

               <opener>
                  <dateline>GREENFIELD, IOWA, march 15.</dateline>
                  <salute>MY DEAR COUSIN,—</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOURS of the 10th duly received, and as welcome as your letters always are. So you
                  have seen the kingdoms of the world and the glory thereof, and find that all is
                  vanity, as saith the Preacher. Do not imagine that I am studying divinity instead
                  of medicine; but to-day is Sunday, and I have been twice to meeting, and taken tea
                  with the minister besides.</p>
               <p>But to return to our mutton. Nothing could be more delightful, or, on the whole,
                  more probable to me, than your decision to return to Outpost, instead of settling
                  in Boston or New York. I can hardly fancy my cousin Dora changed into a fine lady,
                  and fretting herself thin over the color of ribbon, or the trail of a skirt; and I
                  am not surprised that she finds what is called "society" puzzling and wearisome.
                  Your life, Dora, began upon too wide a plan to bear narrowing down into
                  conventional limits now; and I feel through my own heart the thrill with which you
                  wrote the words,—</p>
               <p>"I long for the opportunity of action and usefulness; I long for the freedom of
                  the prairie, and the dignity of labor; I long to resume my old life, and to see my
                  husband begin his new one."</p>
               <p>But, to be quite frank, I was a little surprised that Mr. Burroughs should enter
                  so heartily into your plan of resuming the farm. To be sure, I suppose the
                  land-agency, and the practice of his profession, will occupy most of his time; and
                  his principal concern with the estate will be to admire your able management of
                  it. You and he, my dear Dora, seem to form not only a mutual-admiration, but a
                  mutual-encouragement and mutual-assistance society; and I wish my partnership with
                  Dr. Gershom was half as satisfactory an arrangement.</p>
               <p>Yesterday, after receiving your letter, I rode directly to Outpost, and
                  communicated your wishes to Seth and Mehitable. The former threw the chip he was
                  whittling into the fire, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Miss Burroughs coming back? Waal, then, I'll stop; but I own, doctor, I wouldn't
                  ha' done it ef she hadn't. It's took all the heart out o' the place, her bein'
                  gone so."</p>
               <p>And Mehitable and he joined in a chorus of praises and<pb n="410-411"
                     xml:id="VAC5676-00000206"/> reminiscences, which, pleasant though I found it, I
                  will not put you to the blush by repeating. Both, however, promised faithfully
                  that the house and farm should be ready for you by the middle of April; and Seth
                  says he can take hold "right smart" at helping put up the new house, as he was
                  "raised a carpenter," in part at least.</p>
               <p>You ask about me, my dear cousin; but what have I to tell? I work hard at my
                  profession, and take nearly all the night-practice off Dr. Gershom's hands; so I
                  have very little leisure for any thing besides: and you say to be useful is to be
                  happy; so I suppose I am happy; but, if I may be allowed the suggestion, it is
                  rather a negative kind of bliss, and will be decidedly augmented when Outpost is
                  once again open to me as a second home (I assure you I shall be a frequent
                  visitor), and when Burroughs comes to occupy an office beside my own.</p>
               <p>As for the rumor of my engagement to Sarah Gershom, it is quite unfounded. I am
                  not thinking of marrying at present.</p>
               <p>A letter from Kitty, received a few days since, brings very satisfactory accounts
                  of her progress in learning and in life. She is as happy as possible in her
                  engagement to Frank Brown, and improves, under his tuition, beyond my wildest
                  hopes. She has a strong nature and a deep heart, has Kitty; and I believe Brown
                  understands and can guide them both. Kitty tells me, also, that Theodore Ginniss
                  is taking high honors in his class, and is one of the most promising fellows at
                  Antioch College. He will yet become man of mark, and Mrs. Legrange may well be
                  proud of her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégé</foreign>. Give her my regards,
                  please; and a thousand kisses to Dolce, whom I thank most humbly for her kind
                  message to her poor old Karlo. I hope to see her again in my little vacation next
                  summer. Remember me, too, most kindly to your husband, upon whose coming to
                  Greenfield I am depending a good deal, as I do not suffer, like you, from too much
                  society; and I shall be glad to associate with one man who does not chew tobacco,
                  or sit in the house with his hat on.</p>
               <p>And now, dear Dora, good-night, and good-by for a little while.</p>
