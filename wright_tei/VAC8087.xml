THANKSGIVING DAY.&#xD;
WELCOME to this dear old festival!I Again, with&#xD;
cordal sauaondwgetis                  cmn.    May&#xD;
it be kept through all time ! May it be set&#xD;
apart, dedicated ever as .now, to holy thoughts, and&#xD;
hymns of gratitude, and deeds of love !&#xD;
And to-day, we bid it a thousand welcomes. To-&#xD;
day, for the first time in our history, has it become&#xD;
a National Holiday, and all the members of our&#xD;
great family of States have come together, with&#xD;
heartfelt unanimity, to sing praises, and to pour out&#xD;
thanks to the great Father of Mercies. Oh, may&#xD;
the good example this day set, be faithfully followed,&#xD;

&#xD;
and may this, henceforth, be a fixed feast in our&#xD;
national calendar!&#xD;
And will it not be so? I believe it. I believe this&#xD;
day is to play a glorious part in our great future, to&#xD;
exert a' mighty influence on our career. how many&#xD;
noble deeds will date from it! How many princely&#xD;
benefactions, right royal charities, will it bear wit-&#xD;
ness to, with each coming year.! How many happy&#xD;
firesides, renewe&amp;amp; friendships, buried quarrels, sa~.&#xD;
cred vows, how many, many precious things of all&#xD;
kinds, wilforiginate in the impulses of this blessed&#xD;
period!&#xD;
Thanksgiving day, two centuries hence! What&#xD;
a day! And what a land! One great garden,&#xD;
its walls washed by either ocean; one vast congre-&#xD;
gation of cheerful, thriving workers. But this d&#xD;
their labors are suspended, and they go. forth, with&#xD;
one accord, to offer their prayers and praises to the&#xD;
great Giver. ilark to the myriads of church-bells,&#xD;
as they send forth their, invitations from city and&#xD;
hamlet, from hill-side and valley! Behold the&#xD;
countless multitudes of worshippers, young and old,&#xD;
thoughtful parents and happy children, as along&#xD;
every lane, and 'road, and street, and avenue through~&#xD;
&#xD;
out the land, in scattered groups or orderly proces.~&#xD;
sion, they take their way alike to rural chapel, and&#xD;
dicer fYtI village church, and sumptuous cathedral.&#xD;
And now we hear the blended strains of ten thou~&#xD;
san(l org~n5, and the sweIlin~ notes of innumerable&#xD;
voices, chanting their festal hymns unto the alP&#xD;
bountiful Creator. Arid now all, is hushed in silence,&#xD;
and presently the low, solemn tones of prayer are&#xD;
heard, ascending unto heaven, rising alike from the&#xD;
hearts of stately cities, and from lone vales, deep&#xD;
hid in woods; ay, from every vale, and hill, and&#xD;
plain of this vast, this thrice-blest land; the accept-&#xD;
able incense of grateful souls unto the great Father~&#xD;
What a spectacle, what a service is here Oh. that&#xD;
the poor, tempest-tossed men of Plymouth could&#xD;
have beheld it, could have had their souls cheered&#xD;
by such a vision, Their eyes greeted with sounds like&#xD;
these!&#xD;
Thanksgiving day throughout ~ the world! Will&#xD;
not that day yet come, upon the earth? I believe it.&#xD;
A day of solemn, universal recognition and. coin-&#xD;
memoration of God's goodness; a day on which, IU-&#xD;

the other commonwealths of the civilized, Christian-&#xD;

&#xD;
ized world will, with one consent, come together and&#xD;
join their orisons and hymns with hers; when every&#xD;
nation, and tongue, and island, and valley, and hill-&#xD;
side of earth, shall bear part in the glorious service;&#xD;
when every Art shall lend its choicest inspiration,&#xD;
to render that service worthy of the great Father;&#xD;
when, in a word, this our once little New England&#xD;
festival, shall become the great holiday of earth!&#xD;
Blessed consummation, thrice blessed spectacle,&#xD;
whereat the angels pause ~to gaze with rapture! A&#xD;
world in prayer; a world chanting its Maker's&#xD;
praise in glorious concert !&#xD;
And are these things to come to pass, indeed?&#xD;
Is this blissful future in store for our dear planet?&#xD;
Are all these triumphs of truth, these precious vic-&#xD;
tories over evil to be secured? Are the bloody rites,&#xD;
the gloomy superstitions, the cruel wars, the. igno-&#xD;
rance, apathy, imbecility, the groveling appetites,&#xD;
the savage passions of men, to be exterminated, and&#xD;
all nations to be resolved, at last, into one great,&#xD;
peaceful, loving, Christian family, and earth itself&#xD;
to become a miniature heaven, and every day that&#xD;
dawns upon it a day of Thanksgiving ~*&#xD;
I believe it. I cling to the glorious thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
Call me dreamer, visionary, if you will. Be it so;&#xD;
Maj I ever dream such dreams, and be blest with&#xD;
such visions!&#xD;
Yes, I confess it; mine is a hopeful, cheerful na-&#xD;
ture. I love to look on the bright side ~of things. I&#xD;
love to draw good omens from the past, to put a corn-&#xD;
- portable construction upon all the mysteries, and&#xD;
trace a paternal hand in all the trials of the pres-&#xD;
ent, and above all, to keep ever in view an inspiring,&#xD;
magnificent future; to look along the vista of ages,&#xD;
and behold, not sullen clouds and angry spectres,&#xD;
but golden smiles, and waving palm-trees, and smil-&#xD;
ing angels, to cheer the ~pilgrim on.&#xD;
Well, who of us are right in this matter, we the&#xD;
children of hope and believers in progress, or the&#xD;
croakers, the chanters of perpetual lamentations;&#xD;
the men who see nothing in the world of to-day,&#xD;
wiser or better than in the world before the flood;&#xD;
and who see nothing ahead, but the same dreary&#xD;
round of folly, vanity, rand vice, that they declare&#xD;
human life to have ever been, from the first syllable&#xD;
of recorded time? the men, whos6 whole creed may&#xD;
be summed up ~in those most dismal lines that ever&#xD;

I have had a good deal of talk on this and kindred&#xD;
topics, of late, with my good friends B. and C. Our&#xD;
conversations have b~een, of course, entirely familiar&#xD;
and immethodical in their character; spontaneous&#xD;
expres4ons of our ideas as they rose; by no means,&#xD;
models either in the way of style or sentiment, and&#xD;
at times, it must be acknowledged, somewhat tinged&#xD;
with levity; but on the whole, ash trust will appear,&#xD;
animated by a becoming heartiness of feeling, and&#xD;
integrity of purpose. Else I certainly should not,&#xD;
as I have, ventured to reproduce them, with be-&#xD;
coming modifications and amendments, and in their&#xD;
original form.&#xD;

&#xD;
CONVERSATION. I.&#xD;
&#xD;
soul, however humble or abject on earth, but also&#xD;
cherish the belief of a slow, steady, sure and tri&amp;amp;&#xD;
umphant progress to perfection~ of the great brother-&#xD;
hood here below, and of the final conversion of this&#xD;
dear world of ours into one grand, delightful family&#xD;
mansion, as it were, of loving, happy kinsmen,.&#xD;
Such are our differences of opinion. In one thing,&#xD;
I trust, we will be found to agree, and that is, a due&#xD;
sense of our own frail, erring, sinful natures. Far&#xD;
from us be the temerity, the presumption to set up'~&#xD;
for models, or teachers, or to suppose that we have&#xD;
been particularly profound, or brilliant, or witty, in&#xD;
these our interlocutions. A fair share of naturaL&#xD;
ness and truthfulness, enlivened here and there it&#xD;
may be, by an occasional bright thought, or happy&#xD;
illustration, such is the sum total of our pretensions&#xD;
in the premises.&#xD;
With this brief explanation, I submit the 'follow-&#xD;
ing pages to the consideration of such kind and&#xD;
courteous reader as may be willing to throw away&#xD;
a little hour o' two upon them.&#xD;

* A. Pensive as ever, my dear B., this morning!&#xD;
A penny for your thoughts.&#xD;
B. Too much, too much. , As a conscientious&#xD;
man, Ii should have to give you at least three far-&#xD;
things' change.&#xD;
A. But what were you thinking a1~out 3&#xD;
B. Oh, nothing special-the same old story;&#xD;
the beautiful uncertainty of life, the magnificence&#xD;
of human nature,' the sweet gloom and mystery that&#xD;
o 'erhang the grave; in short, the usual agreeable&#xD;
topics.&#xD;
A. And you were discussing them, of course, in&#xD;
your usual gloomy and cynical spirit. Always harp-&#xD;
ing on the same melancholy string, always chanting&#xD;
in the minor key! Ah, my friend, you are. very&#xD;
wrong in this.&#xD;
B. You think so, do you?&#xD;

&#xD;
A. .I do, indeed. I think it most unmanly and&#xD;
unchristian in you, to cherish such sad,. such per-&#xD;
verse feelings. You, of Ell men in the world, too ;&#xD;
who have so much to be thankful for ; you, who have&#xD;
youth, health, friends, means, talents, Leisure, all the&#xD;
prizes of life, indeed; who have every motive to be&#xD;
happy, and to make those about you happy. You--&#xD;
B. Stop, stop, my good friend.' Be pleased to&#xD;
recollect that this is Monday, and that I have hardly&#xD;
had time yet to digest the very able and effective&#xD;
discourse of yesterday morning. Besides, it's ask-&#xD;
ing too much of a nman, to be text and audience both.&#xD;
A. You're bitter.&#xD;
B. Not at all. I really do think, though, that&#xD;
you were cut out for a clergyman, You'd have been&#xD;
a most devoted one. You'd have been in the pulpit&#xD;
full seven days in the week.&#xD;
A. Better the pulpit of the Christian, than the&#xD;
tub of the cynic.&#xD;
B. Now you are complimentary.&#xD;
A. But sarcasm apart, and talking over the mat-&#xD;
ter like the true friends that we are, I must repeat,&#xD;
my dear fellow,, that you are terribly off the track,&#xD;
in cultivating the gloomy views of life that you do.&#xD;
I think you are alike sowing the seeds of unhappi-.&#xD;
ness for yourself, and defrauding society of its just&#xD;
claims upon your services. You have no right to&#xD;
keep in a corner thus, and to be cherishing this fas-&#xD;
tidious, morose, sceptical, inactive disposition. You&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ought to be up and about, doing good, lighting up&#xD;
the clouded faces of your poor brethren with words&#xD;
arid deeds of kindness. At your time of life, you&#xD;
ought to be full of hope and faith, over sanguine,&#xD;
ever cheerful,-&#xD;
B. Preach away, preach away. Don't spare&#xD;
your powder.&#xD;
A. I don't intend to; nor the offender. lHar-&#xD;
dened sinner that he evidently is, he miay yet live&#xD;
to profit by a friend's advice, and thank him for it.&#xD;
B. I ask pardon. I was wrong in interrupting&#xD;
you thug. But seriously, my friend, I cannot look&#xD;
upon this matter as you do. I do not consider ex-&#xD;
istence such an unqualified boon, nor my own par-&#xD;
ticular lot in life, however favorably it may compare&#xD;
with that of the majority, as carrying with i tany&#xD;
such overwhelming weight of obligation or of grati-&#xD;
tude. If you think you can alter my views, how-&#xD;
ever, go ahead. I am quite ready to listen ; nay, I&#xD;
cheerfully admit the excellence, both of your inten-&#xD;
tions, and of your oratory.&#xD;
A. .There you are again, sneering as usual.&#xD;
B. Sneering?&#xD;
-A. Yes, sneering ; but the-fact is, you have got&#xD;
into such a habit of sarcasm and irony, that you are&#xD;
not conscious of it.&#xD;
B. Forgive me, my dear fellow, forgive me. I&#xD;
certainly meant no offence. But 1 say again, I dif-&#xD;
fer with you, toto cwlo, on this subject. I can't see&#xD;

any such cogent reasons why I or my neighbors&#xD;
ought to be so wonderfully cheerful. Cheerful, for-&#xD;
sooth, in a~ world .like this, where all is frailty and&#xD;
instability ; where a man is liable to fall down in a&#xD;
fit every moment; where his nearest and dearest&#xD;
friends are snatched away from him, oven while his&#xD;
head is turned, by perpetually recurring casualties&#xD;
where ten thousand subtle and malignant diseases&#xD;
are flying about, and Death is incessantly discharg-&#xD;
ing his poisoned shafts at him and his, from every&#xD;
nook and corner ; cheerful, in a city like this,, where&#xD;
every man's neck is at the mercy of bullies 'and&#xD;
omnibus-drivers ; cheerful, say you, in a community&#xD;
like ours, where a citizen is afraid to go a few miles&#xD;
up the river to make a friendly call, lest he should&#xD;
be burned, or drowned, or scalded to death ; with the&#xD;
comfortable assurance, too, that his murderers, in-&#xD;
stead of being brought to condign punishment, will'&#xD;
at most be dismissed with a gentle rebuke, and with-&#xD;
in a twelvemonth, perhaps, of the occurrence, be-&#xD;
come the recipients of massive services of .silver-.&#xD;
What-is there in all this, to call for any such super-&#xD;
abundance of gayety or of thankfulness ? Look at&#xD;
that morning paper on the table there, and then a'slk&#xD;
me to be cheerful! Is'nt it crammed with all sorts&#xD;
of horrid crimes and disasters? Not to speak of&#xD;
the thefts, robberies, murders, suicides, just glance&#xD;
at that frightful list of fires, and explosions, and&#xD;
railroad accidents, and above. all, at that heart-&#xD;

sickening account of that steamboat collision. If&#xD;
there is anything to move mirth in all this, it must&#xD;
be the ,mirth of some 'grinning,. mocking demon.&#xD;
And isn't every day's paper filled with the same dis-&#xD;
mal records ? the same dreary' evidences of human&#xD;
wickedness and wretchedness ? Cheerful, indeed !&#xD;
no, no. So far froxg singing these psalms of thanks&amp;amp;&#xD;
giving that you are so eternally harping upon, I con-&#xD;
fess I do feel at times disposed. to 'call in question&#xD;
the goodness of the Creator, and to curse the very&#xD;
hour that I saw daylight.&#xD;
A. .Don't, don't, my dear friend, talk so unrea-&#xD;
sonably, so wildly.&#xD;
B. So you say ; but I maintain that the facts&#xD;
and the reason are with me in this matter.&#xD;
A. I deny it. I join issue with you. most dis-&#xD;
tinctly on- this point. Nay, I will call your own 'wit-&#xD;
ness. I 'take up this very paper of yours, and I say&#xD;
that I see far more in it to fill me with pride and&#xD;
admiration and gratitude, than with their~piposites ;&#xD;
far more manifestations of enterprise, skill, and be-&#xD;
nevolence, than of folly and villainy. There are&#xD;
some sad accidents here, to be sure. There are&#xD;
many things to grieve, to weep over, but far more to&#xD;
make me rejoice in my country, and in my race, and&#xD;
,to pour out, my soul ~in thanks unto the great&#xD;
Father.&#xD;

Could you see the dear little massacred innocents&#xD;
'all in a heap together, you wouldn't talk so. Look&#xD;

and all the rest of those grim weapons in Death's&#xD;
magazine of terrors. What is there to glad the&#xD;
heart of friend or parent, in such a statement as&#xD;
this?&#xD;
A. At first blush, I grant you, the record seems&#xD;
a dismal one; the sad index of a sad volume of suf.&#xD;
ferings and bereavements. Faith alone can solve,&#xD;
can reconcile us to dispensations like these. Still,&#xD;
my friend, do not, forget how many of these same&#xD;
departures weke blessed releases from long suffer-&#xD;
ings, how many were in the order of nature. But&#xD;
above all do not forget, as you seem disposed to,&#xD;
while dwelling on the fallen ones, the tenfold greater&#xD;
number of those who have been rescued from the&#xD;
/&#xD;
destroyer, by generous Nature herself, or by timely&#xD;
skill. Is it logical, is it decent, to take the ground&#xD;
you do? Is it fair, either, to make so much of (and&#xD;
in such a shamefully bitter and heathenish spirit)&#xD;
the thousandth casualty that occurs, and have not&#xD;
one word of gratitude to offer for the nine hundred&#xD;
and ninety-nine safe' arrivals, by sea and land, that&#xD;
are' coternporaneous with it? I see in this very col-&#xD;
umn to which you have referred, an account of two&#xD;
vessels foundering at sea. It is a sad' story, cer-&#xD;

tainly; but then I cast my eyes upon the column&#xD;
alongside, and I see a long, long catalogue of ships&#xD;
from all corners of the world, that have reached&#xD;
their journey's end, unharmed. Had it been the&#xD;
other way, now, there would have been some ground&#xD;
for lamentation, some excuse for grumbling.&#xD;
B. Plausible as ever.&#xD;
* A. Just, just. 'Tis yotj that are plausible. You&#xD;
judge by the exceptions, I by the rules. You take&#xD;
for standards the crimes, shipwrecks, and casualties&#xD;
of life; I the wise, ~brderly, beneficent course of na-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
B. In other words, I suppose, I'm a grumbler,&#xD;
and you an optimist.&#xD;
A. Be it so: between two such extremes what&#xD;
heart can hesitate? At the same time, I think the&#xD;
truth is far nearer my end of the line than yours.&#xD;
B. Of course you do.&#xD;
A. And 1 think I could demonstrate it; that is,&#xD;
if we were to discuss the subject in 4a friendly and&#xD;
liberal spirit, anti not an acid and sarcastic one.&#xD;
B. You seem to think that verjuice predominates&#xD;
in my composition. Don't you now?.&#xD;
A. Candidly, I do somewhat; not by nature,&#xD;
however, but' from a wilful cherishing of perverse&#xD;
habits and opinions.&#xD;
B. That is, what you call perverse. That's&#xD;
just the difference. What I think a reasonable cau-&#xD;

nate crabbedness and skepticism; and on the other&#xD;
hand, what you would call a noble generosity, I&#xD;
should be apt to resolve into vanity and enthusiasm.&#xD;
Who is to decide between us?&#xD;
A. No doubt, my dear friend, persons of our oppo-&#xD;
site views and temperaments, are too apt to misun-&#xD;
derstand, and undervalue each other. The only way&#xD;
is to toil faithfully after the truth, and to own up&#xD;
handsomely, and act accordingly, when convinced.&#xD;
But to return to our paper.&#xD;
B. True, true. I suppose now you think those&#xD;
three miles of advertisements there, are gratifying,&#xD;
inspiring objects; are each and all models of truth&#xD;
and soberness. I must take the liberty of consider-&#xD;
ing at least nine-tenths of them abominable, false-&#xD;
hoods, worthy of Falstaff himself; got up by quacks,&#xD;
showmen, swindlers of all sorts and sizes, to mislead&#xD;
and victimize the verdant. Indeed, I doubt whether&#xD;
a single one of that page-full of certificates of the&#xD;
superhuman qualities of all those pills, candies, lini-&#xD;
'ments, cordials, and razor-straps, is signed by a&#xD;
bonafide human being, a living, breathing ta~x-payer.&#xD;
Of course, you think differently. So far from seeing&#xD;
~ ny thing to awaken that pride and admiration, of&#xD;
which yo~ speak, in such a frightful aggregation of&#xD;
fibs, I consider them a disgrace to the metropolis;&#xD;
II see in them most shanieful evideitices of the cor-&#xD;
riipting, degrading tendencies of trade.&#xD;
4. Severe and unjust criticism! That there is&#xD;
&#xD;
some trifling with truth here, especially under the&#xD;
medical head, I grant you; but that the great bulk&#xD;
of these advertisements are the representatives of&#xD;
facts, ay, and of most creditable facts, I am convin-&#xD;
ced.* Yes, I ant proud of them; prQud of these&#xD;
silent witnesses to so much wealth, and thrift, and&#xD;
enterprise. I do look with gratification at these&#xD;
long files of ships, and steamers, and rail-cars; at&#xD;
the millions and millions of tons of merchandise set&#xD;
forth in these one-line notices; at these solid columns&#xD;
of banks and insurance companies; at this goodly&#xD;
array of amusements, that tells us where a world ~of&#xD;
innocent fun may be had, after the day's work is&#xD;
done; at this long, bristling catalogue of wants, that&#xD;
bespeaks a bustling, thriving population; yes, at the&#xD;
whole record, as bearing testimony to a free, active,&#xD;
flourishing, ingenuous, noble-spirited community.&#xD;
B. Well, well, one of us must be terribly mista~&#xD;
ken in this matter. I can't help thinking that you&#xD;
are surveying the ground through your usual rose-&#xD;
colored., magnifiers.&#xD;
A. And you, it may ber through your usual&#xD;
cloudy and yellow tinted ones. But even were this&#xD;
same journal, the gloomy record you try to make it&#xD;
out, is it altogether fair to pronounce upon human&#xD;
life and human nature, from such data as the col-&#xD;
umns of newspapers and the pages of historians ?-&#xD;
Are they not perpetually overlooking~ the orderly&#xD;
and commendable parts of both, in their chase after&#xD;

the piquant and surprising? When the current of&#xD;
existence flows smoothly and beneficently on, they&#xD;
have nothing to say about it; when swollen and mis-&#xD;
chievous, we are sure to hear the full particulars of&#xD;
all its evil doings: What cares the historian for the&#xD;
piping times of peace, for quiet villages, and thriving&#xD;
towns? his laurels, like those of his heroes, are&#xD;
only to be gathered in revolutions, and on battle-&#xD;
fields. What interest does a journalist take in a&#xD;
respectable, well-regulated neighborhood? Let some&#xD;
foul scandal, or black crime spring up, to overthrow&#xD;
the happiness and fair fame of a whole household,&#xD;
and he will not fail to do ample justice to the sad&#xD;
theme~ while he passes by, in barren silence, the&#xD;
hundreds of peaceful firesides around him; just as&#xD;
he will blazon forth the ostentati~us bequests of some&#xD;
rich neighbor, while the hundreds of poor widows'&#xD;
mites that are daily dropped h~to the* treasury, do&#xD;
their blessed work without a chronicler. Yes, there&#xD;
is a world of unrecorded goodness all about us, that&#xD;
we are quite too ready to overlook and ignore, in our&#xD;
rash denunciations of human nature.&#xD;
B. And, by the same rule~ is there not a loath-&#xD;
some mass of meanness, vice, and villainy, to which&#xD;
we are equally blind, in our rash eulogiums upon it?&#xD;
A. I think not. I think the evil parts are* far&#xD;
more apt to see the light; to be talked and written&#xD;
about, and to find their way into print. Rogues, like&#xD;
invalids, are always chattering, and betraying them-&#xD;

selves, whereas goodness ever keeps its own counsels,&#xD;
an(l is chary of singing its own praises how many&#xD;
glorious entries are there, on the records of the angels,&#xD;
that we dream not of; how much stealthy bone vo-&#xD;
lence, how much patience under affliction, how much&#xD;
faith and resignation; ay, and in countries that we&#xD;
look down upon, as heathens ~nd~barbarians! how&#xD;
many humble women are there, scattered all over the&#xD;
globe, whose lives are spent in ministering unto sick-&#xD;
ness and sorrow! Every river-side, every village,&#xD;
liam~e t, every sequestered dell of earth, bears witness&#xD;
to them; bears witness also, to a little world of ob-&#xD;
scure but heai~tfclt happiness, that we quite forget&#xD;
in our sweeping lamentations over human life.&#xD;
B. I can't agree with you. Of course, I admit,&#xD;
there is a good deal of worth, and of happiness, that&#xD;
don't find its way into the pages of the annali~t, or&#xD;
the columns of the journalist; but I also maintain&#xD;
that there is a fifty-fold greater amount of obscure&#xD;
misery and rascality. As to the angelic records, to&#xD;
which you allude, I confess I shudder at the thought&#xD;
of them. For every page in them that is matter of&#xD;
rejoicing, I believe there are h1indreds that are&#xD;
themes for bitter, burning tears. Nor do I see how&#xD;
any accurate reader of his own heart, or of those of&#xD;
his brethren, can come to any other conclusion. Yes.&#xD;
we are a poor, wretched, sin-loving set. We love to&#xD;
commit it ourselves, and we dearly love to read about&#xD;
the sins of others. And the journalist who does not&#xD;

duly recognize and cater to this propensity, and stuff&#xD;

morning, that he would thenceforth banish from his&#xD;
sheet all acrimonious, scandalous, and criminal mat-&#xD;

like autumn leaves'? A newspaper without lies and&#xD;

without his army of placard-bearers&#xD;
A. Cheerful, cheerful views, these; so inspiring,&#xD;
too; so calculated to arouse a man to noble effort!&#xD;
B. And yet, does not every page of history, from&#xD;
Adam down, proclaim their truth?&#xD;
A. Not so, not so: I cannot, I will fiot believe it.&#xD;
I will not cherish, nor can I bear to see yo.u cherish,&#xD;
sentiments that I consider alike blasphemous towards&#xD;
God, fatal to one's own happiness, and Qpposed to all&#xD;
heroic exertions for the happiness of others; senti-&#xD;
ments that seem to me to spring far more from a&#xD;
selfish and rebellious spirit, than from a calm, wise&#xD;
survey of nature or of providence.&#xD;
B. You speak plainly.&#xD;
A. But not in anger or bitterness.&#xD;
B. No, no; I believe you. However skeptical&#xD;

(for so I can't help thinking them) most gloomy and&#xD;
unsound notions of yours.&#xD;
B. If you think any good can come of such dis-&#xD;
cussions, so be it. I have no great faith in them&#xD;
myself, and moreover think them far better suited&#xD;

mises and most contemptible performances: what is&#xD;
there, but a soul groaning under the iron rule of a&#xD;
body; a reason mocked with royal titles, but shorn&#xD;
of all true sovereignty; a conscience that hardly&#xD;
shows fight even, with the evil one, but falls before&#xD;
every pitiful temptation. What is there here to be-&#xD;
get any great degree of self-love, or any very ardent&#xD;
desire after immortality? And do I wrong my&#xD;
brethren and neighbors, when I say, that I see in&#xD;
nine-tenths of them pretty much the same charac-&#xD;
teristics? the same imbecility~ and ignorance, the&#xD;
same mad chase after present pleasures and excite-&#xD;
ments, the same wilful turning of their backs upon&#xD;
true wisdom and goodness? Yes, I confess it; life&#xD;
does seem to me a fright complication of mysteries&#xD;
and evils and inequalitie~; here the pangs of penury,&#xD;
there the nausea of s ~iety; here the artyr to&#xD;
business, there t1~e victirA to idleness. Is not man-&#xD;
kind the sa~ne motley crowd that ever it was, of&#xD;
peer4 and paupers, priests and pick-pockets, scholars&#xD;
and sots? And is there not, now as ever, the same&#xD;
frightful predominance every where, of folly, sin and&#xD;
sorrow? Of course, you will say, no, and will, as&#xD;
you did just now, utterly repudiate ~and denounce&#xD;
such sentiments.&#xD;
A. I do, indeed, and it grieves me to the soul to&#xD;
see you entertain and dwell upon them thus. I say&#xD;
that you do injustice alike to yourself and your&#xD;
brethren; that the world never was so bad as you&#xD;

ever it was, and that I firmly believe it will go on&#xD;

unto the end. But above all, do I believe in a bless-&#xD;
ed life to come, that is to sol~ these same mysteries&#xD;
and sorrows, of which you so ceaselessly complain&#xD;
(while you have no word of thanks to utter for&#xD;
your ten thousand benefits and privileges), and that&#xD;
is to reveal in him that hath sent or permitted&#xD;
them, an infinitely wise and gracious Father.&#xD;
B. Well then, if you will discuss the matter,&#xD;
which of us is right-you, who entertain this belief&#xD;
and these expectations; or I, who have no faith in&#xD;
the amendment of this world, and (I own it) little or&#xD;
no faith in,.or even hope of a world to come?&#xD;
A. What, not even a hope of immortality?&#xD;
B. No, no. I ask no future life. The present&#xD;
is quite burthen enough. I would fain drop that&#xD;
burden at the grave, and there have an end. I&#xD;
covet not the possible glories, I shrink from the pos-&#xD;
sible sufferings of any second existence. No such&#xD;
risk for me. No, no; give me the sleep thajt knows&#xD;
no waking; not a mere truce between two turbulent,&#xD;
tumultuous worlds, but a sweet ar}d lasting peace.&#xD;
I ask no more. Heaven knows I have no claims&#xD;
upon it, in the shape of future rewards, nor shall&#xD;
have; and I woidd most gladly evade its punish-&#xD;
n~ents. I am for closing the account, good and all,&#xD;

clearly and deeply the book of Providence; nay, to&#xD;
be a partaker of God's counsels, to be employed by&#xD;
him in heavenly missions, to have the charge and&#xD;
guardianship, it may be, of stars and systems filled&#xD;
with intelligent, accountable beings; to enlighten,&#xD;
rescue, and redeem them from the thraldom of sin, -&#xD;

J&#xD;
so insult you, as to suppose you the incurious, unam-&#xD;
bitious, cold, dull, groveling creature that you would&#xD;
fhin declare yourself; to suppose you capable of thus&#xD;
wilfully turning your back upon visions and possi-&#xD;
bilities like these, and of preferring to go down to&#xD;
your gravq, and rot, and p~iss away forever, of no&#xD;
more worth or signmfic~nce than the meanest weed&#xD;
or vilest reptile of earth..&#xD;
I?. Fine talk, brave words these; but as usual,&#xD;
my dear friend, you have quite left out the shadows&#xD;
in this fancy sketch of yours; you say not a word.&#xD;
about those other visions and possibilities That be~&#xD;
long to tl~e future. You talk of angels and arc~h-&#xD;
angels, and of happier climes and hoi~nes above, and&#xD;
of ever-expanding capacities, and, joys, and duties;&#xD;
but you quite overlook the lemons a'nd arch-demons,&#xD;
and their dismal abodes, and their ever-increasing&#xD;
powers of inflicting and of suffering evil. You talk&#xD;
as if all these stars around us were miniature hea-&#xD;
vens, dedicated unto peace and love. Where then,&#xD;
let me ask, are Satan's dominions? Are then, the&#xD;
seeds of good so scantily sown here on earth, to&#xD;
yield such glorious fruit hereafter, and are the far&#xD;
more plenteously sown seeds of evil to come to&#xD;
nought? If there is to be this illimitable growth&#xD;
in grace, why not in wickedness also? You seem&#xD;
to think this world a mere nursery for angels, but&#xD;
may it not be far more of a primary school for dcv-&#xD;

almost exclusive control over it. You cannot be in&#xD;
earnest, in expressing such sentiments . You do&#xD;
not anticipate any such horrible career for yourself&#xD;

Who can doubt that we shall all, in God's good sea-&#xD;

ings over, meet in that blessed land at last ; shall&#xD;
enter on a glorious career of joys, and duties, and&#xD;
contemplation, compared with which all the beauty,&#xD;
and glory, and wisdom of earth~ are the veriest toys&#xD;
of children? You smile, and will no doubt call&#xD;
these the, dreams of an enthusiast. But are they&#xD;
not better than the horribly gloomy picture you con-&#xD;
jured up just now? Nay more (if you were in ear-&#xD;
nest in what you said), are you not fur more ultra&#xD;
and visionary in your notions, than I in mine; far&#xD;
more unreasonable and wild in your despondency&#xD;
than I ill my high hopes? If I have left out the&#xD;
shadows, as you say, in my picture, have you not&#xD;
utterly banished every glimmer even of cheerful&#xD;
light from yours?&#xD;
B. Well, to tell the honest truth, I was rather&#xD;
replying to you in your own, fanciful and extravagant&#xD;
strain, (for so, my dear friend, I must consider it,)&#xD;
than speaking the real sentiments of my heart. I&#xD;
confess, I have very few hopes or fears about the&#xD;
matter. I certainly do not look forward to any such&#xD;
horrible hereafter as I hinted at, any more than I&#xD;
do to the magnificent one, which ,you have painted in&#xD;
such glowing colors. To me, the terrors and the&#xD;
splendors seem alike visionary. Your angel-throng-&#xD;
ed palaces of light, and my demon-haunted abodes of&#xD;
darkness, are they not alike the creations of o'erbusy&#xD;
&#xD;
?ep&#xD;
&#xD;
fancies, alike devoid of any solid foundation in reason?&#xD;
I confess, I am more and more inclined to think so,&#xD;
every day.&#xD;
A. As you will. In either case, your views seem&#xD;
to me as little consistent with sound reasoning, as&#xD;
they are gloomy and repulsive. You begin by find-&#xD;
ing fault with every thing in this world. Not a&#xD;
thing suits you: all is vanity and vexation, gall and&#xD;
bitterness; and you end by rejecting any other; or&#xD;
should there possibly be another, you can only see&#xD;
in it a thousand fold more guilt and wretchedness.&#xD;
You seem to ha~v~ no faith whatever in your own&#xD;
freedom, or in God's goodness; in your power to re-&#xD;
pent and reform, or in God's acceptance of your pen-&#xD;
itence; should you possibly survive the grave, you&#xD;
take it for granted that you will be consigned to the&#xD;
tender mercies of Satan; but on the whole, you do&#xD;
not believe in any such survivorship. In other&#xD;
words, you deliberately accuse your Maker of amus-&#xD;
ing himself at the expense of His poor children; of&#xD;
putting them here, surrounding them with trials and&#xD;
sorrows, vexing 'their souls with all manner of rid-&#xD;
dles and problems, tantalizing them with all manner&#xD;
of desires and aspirations, and then, so far from&#xD;
vouchsafing them a single word of explanation, or a&#xD;
single look of coaifort and encouragement, of wan-&#xD;
tonly stemming the door in their faces, of delibe-&#xD;
rately stopping their mouths forever, in the grave!&#xD;

CONVERSATION II.&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
A. IN our last conversation, my dear friend, I&#xD;
expressed a wish to discuss farther, certain senti-&#xD;
ments of yours, which, the more I reflect upon them,&#xD;
the more and more dreary and frightful do they ap-&#xD;
pear. Let m~ ask you again, were you in earnest in&#xD;
uttering them? IDo you really entertain a skepti-&#xD;
cism s~o dismal, so fatal to all peace and happiness,&#xD;
to all noble ambition, and to all hearty effort ai'f~r&#xD;
improvement?&#xD;
B. Why should you doubt my sincerity? I&#xD;
certainly did speak as I felt, on these subjects;&#xD;
gloomily, wickedly, if you will, but God knows, frank-&#xD;
ly. I might better have held my jiea~e, no doubt.&#xD;
As I then told you, I have no faith, myself; in such&#xD;
speculations, or discussions. We poor mortals have&#xD;
been puzzling over, and prattling about these myste-&#xD;
ries, from the beginning, and what good has ever&#xD;
&#xD;
cOme of it all? Are we not just as much in the dark&#xD;
as ever? For every wise word that has been utter-&#xD;
ed in these controversies, have there not been ten&#xD;
thousand foolish and wicked ones? Why seek to&#xD;
multiply them, then? What have I to say, in the&#xD;
premiseS, worth combating, or worth hearing? ~&#xD;
poor, whimsical, ignorant, frail sinner, like me&#xD;
Wouldn't silence be far more becoming? how vis-&#xD;
ionary too, the attempt to make any peri~ianent im-&#xD;
pression upon ea4ch other's opinions, any more than&#xD;
to alter our temperaments. No, no. You, my friend,&#xD;
are blessed with a cheerful, hopeful nature. You&#xD;
appear to have a faith, and teal A enthush~sm&#xD;
upon all subjects. You canno ,if u would, look&#xD;
upon the dark side of things, past, pr sent, or to&#xD;
come. I am differently constituted. I neither have,&#xD;
nor sympathize with these sanguine views of yours.&#xD;
But why should I seek to shake your faith? If you&#xD;
can see your way clear through this world, and have&#xD;
a beautiful vista beyond, to cheer and inspire you,&#xD;
why should I wish to interpose clouds, if I could ?-&#xD;
Oh, no, enjoy, make the most of this generous ardor&#xD;
of yours, and leave, leave me to r~iy gloom and un-&#xD;
belief.&#xD;
A. Not so. I am not willing to drop the matter&#xD;
thus. These themes are, indeed, as you say, old as&#xD;
man, but are they any the less vitally important o~&#xD;
that account? Is not the peace of our souls as&#xD;
deeply involved in them as ever? I am not willing&#xD;

gather frightful and intoh~rable? Wouldn't extin&amp;amp;&#xD;
tion be perfectly delightful in comparison? -&#xD;
A. Unquestionably it would; but what right have&#xD;
you to indulge in any such wild and absurd conjec-&#xD;
tures? Precious notions yours, of the Creator and&#xD;
his universe! How ca~ you talk s'o, with that Bible&#xD;
on your table, too; with God's own promise of a glo-&#xD;
rious life to come, if ~you will but secure it; of a&#xD;
world of beauty and grandeur and happiness, infin-&#xD;
itely beyond all human conception, even, in store for&#xD;
his faithful, obedient children? The idea that frail,&#xD;
sinful man, with all his capacities, is the highest&#xD;
effort of creative wisdom, or that this little earth of&#xD;
ours is the masterpiece in the great gallery of Na-&#xD;
ture, would be absurd enough, I should Think, to the&#xD;
mere philosopher; but to give vent to such whirnsi-&#xD;
cal, such presumptuous speculations, right in the&#xD;
teeth of that blessed revelation there, it seems to me&#xD;
perfectly inexcusable.&#xD;
B. But, my friend, suppose I were to. tell you,&#xD;
that I have no faith in that same revelation?&#xD;
A. WeB, I ought to have expected it; at the&#xD;
same time, I confess, it grieves me to the soul to&#xD;
hear you say so.&#xD;
B. Why should it? Why should I not speak&#xD;
out honestly? If we must discuss thc~e subjects, I&#xD;
am for going to the root of the matter. I am for&#xD;
making a clean breast of it. I have no faith in that&#xD;
Volume, other or greater than I have in that Shaks-&#xD;

CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.           43&#xD;
peare alongside of it, and I feel just as much at lib-&#xD;
erty to criticize it. I see no more of a divine origin&#xD;
in Job, tliuii I do in hamlet. I no moi~e believe that&#xD;
God dictated theparables of Christ, or the Epistles&#xD;
of Paul, than lie did the eloquent pleading of Portia,&#xD;
or the sublime talk of Prospero. This grates harshly&#xD;
on your ear, I see, but so it seems to me. I would&#xD;
not speak disrespectfully nor ungratefully. I have&#xD;
read with delight the exquisite story of Joseph and&#xD;
his brethren; but is it one whit more exquisite than&#xD;
the Winter's Tale? Or is Ruth herself, standing&#xD;
amid the golden corn, one whit more pure and love-&#xD;
able than thc flowei~-crowned Perdita, or is Jepthah's&#xD;
* daughter a finer conception than Cordelia? Is the&#xD;
wis(Iom of Solomon any more genuine and world-&#xD;
embracing than that which the bard kee~~ pouring&#xD;
forth continually, alike in the palaces of kings, and&#xD;
the dungeons of convicts-in the caves of Bohemia,&#xD;
no less than under the pleasant trees of Arden? If&#xD;
the man of Jerusalem was inspired, surely the man&#xD;
of Stratford was. Nor have I any more confidence&#xD;
in the truth of the statements of Kings and Chroni-&#xD;
cles, than I have in those of the historical plays;&#xD;
nay, not half so much.&#xD;
A. I suppose not. You mean to say, then, in a&#xD;
word, that you have no more faith in the facts of the&#xD;
Bible, than in those of any other respectable quarto;&#xD;
that you build no bright hopes upon its promises,&#xD;

The truly wise man smiles at us both, confesses tim&#xD;
profundity of his ignorance, and holds his peace.&#xD;
A. Charming doctrine, this! How delightf~1a one&#xD;
to impart to a child, or to comfort a mourner with,&#xD;
or to encourage a poor penitent! A doctrine ~that&#xD;
turns all prayers and thanksgiving into a mdckery;&#xD;
that converts all the bounties of God into caprices,&#xD;
all the sorrows and sufferings of life into wanton dis-&#xD;
plays of cruelty! But go on. Let us have all the&#xD;
articles of this lovely faith of yours.&#xD;
B. You accuse rn~ of ~being sarcastic. I think&#xD;
you are quite a proficient in the art. I was merely&#xD;
answering your own question. I say again, I' don't&#xD;
pretend to explain the ten thousand mysteries and&#xD;
miseries of life. 1 have no opinion, one way or the&#xD;
other. I see things, certainly, that seem to speak&#xD;
of a kind Creator, and bountiful provider above; I&#xD;
see others that look ~ll harshness and injustice. I&#xD;
saw but yesterday, a spectacle that II confess seemed&#xD;
to me alike unnatural and cruel; I saw a sweet&#xD;
young bride, torn by a merciless disease from the&#xD;
arms of her husband, and from all the delights and&#xD;
endearments' of home and consigned in a narrow&#xD;
box to the damp ground. II saw, recently, three&#xD;
lovely children~, snatched away by the same fell&#xD;
agent of death, all within a few hours; borne off&#xD;
from loving parents, and from the bright joys and&#xD;
hopes of childhood, and laid side by side together in&#xD;
the dismal tomb. Every hour, as you say, bears&#xD;
&#xD;
witness to' such occurrences; every hour shows us&#xD;
the sufferers by others' crimes and vices ; shows us&#xD;
good men involved in perpetual mishaps, and sleek&#xD;
scoundrels thriving in their iniquity, and going down&#xD;
to their graves, unwhipt of justice. Who can com-&#xD;
prehend these puzzles? If I say that they betray a&#xD;
cruel or negligent Creator, you take me to* ta~k at&#xD;
once as a heathen and a rebel; as rashly, in turn,&#xD;
pronouncing them the manifestations of God's love,&#xD;
and the pledges of immortality. But are not both&#xD;
criticisms alike worthless? Are we not utterly in&#xD;
the dark? I certainly cannot derive any comforta-&#xD;
ble faith from such phenomena. What is such faith,&#xD;
but the mere creature of vanity and self-love? We&#xD;
don't like to be treated in this way. We don't like&#xD;
to' be de~p rived of our friends and comforts thus.&#xD;
Wounde~1 pride, and mortified vanity, and *dis~p-&#xD;
pointed.ambition, all p test against such dealings;&#xD;
all join in the cry for an hereafter. We insist upon.&#xD;
it. We call on God to explain himself, and to clear&#xD;
up Ilis conduct. We poor worms of the dust call&#xD;
on the great Creator to demonstrate to our satisfac-&#xD;
tion, the accordance of His dispensations with our&#xD;
notions of justice! But suppose He should not con-&#xD;
descend-to do so? - Suppose He should utterly with-&#xD;
hold from us the illumination, and the compensation,&#xD;
that we so clamor for ! What then? What are we&#xD;
to do about it? 'Who shall presume to read the riddles&#xD;

you speak, explain themselves pretty well, after all,&#xD;

Would Shakspeare himself have expressed himself&#xD;
so feelingly about the repose of his bones, had lie&#xD;
really thought that in dying, he was merely exchang-&#xD;
ing his frail tabernacle of flesh for a more glorious&#xD;
body and a higher sphere of action?&#xD;
A. Excuse me, but I must interrupt this same&#xD;
philosopher of yours, for a moment. I should rather&#xD;
say, that had the poet not behicyod in an hereafter,&#xD;
he wouldn't have cared the toss of a copper about&#xD;
the matter.&#xD;
B. I can't agree with you. On the contrary,&#xD;
had he been a firm believer in immortality, he would,&#xD;
I think, have been at the same time far more indif-&#xD;
ferent about the disposal of his bones, and far more&#xD;
anxious about the disposal and preservation of his&#xD;
plays.&#xD;
A. Oh, no; the poet's indifference about the fate&#xD;
of his plays is, to my mind, far more agreeably and&#xD;
satisfactorily explained by the thought that, con-&#xD;
scious as he was of their merits, they nevertheless&#xD;
fell so far below the glorious ideal that was ever&#xD;
present in his mind, that he got out of patience with&#xD;
&#xD;
them. Nay, is there not a tradition that on being&#xD;
visited by a brother poet one morning, he threw&#xD;
aside his unfinished Othello in disgust, saying~ as he&#xD;
did so, "I hope the day will yet come, my friend,&#xD;
when I shall (10 something worth showing to the&#xD;
world"?&#xD;
B. I must say, I never heard that story. You&#xD;
must have dreamt it, I think. But we are wander-&#xD;
ing from the subject. Do not all these things, then,&#xD;
(our philosopher would ask), this clinging to the&#xD;
good things of life to the last possible moment, this&#xD;
unwillingness to think or talk about death, and the&#xD;
expressions ordinarily made use of in regard to it,&#xD;
all go to show the latent mistrust in men's minds of&#xD;
any thing beyond it? And do they not treat it ac-&#xD;
cordingly? When young, and hearty, and prosper-&#xD;
ous, death is then a presumptuous intruder, or rather&#xD;
a vile kidnapper, come to snatch them away from.&#xD;
the half-tasted banquet of life, from their boon corn-&#xD;
3anions, and pleasures, and excitements; when old,&#xD;
and poor, and weary, and wretched, then is he a&#xD;
kind friend, who comes to light them to their beds,&#xD;
where they may straightway forget all .their aches,&#xD;
pains, and sorrows, in sweet and endless oblivion.&#xD;
Is not this, he would ask, and has it not always been,&#xD;
the real, honest creed of the great mass of the&#xD;
world?&#xD;

never overtakes. Does he dispose of them also, in&#xD;

B. Well, he would tell us, of course, that God i~&#xD;

these troubles. If we lived right, if we obeyed the&#xD;

would be as rugged and as flourishing as the trees of&#xD;

sheer decay of nature; and so, with slowly dimmed&#xD;
perceptions, and gently fading faculties, drop quietly&#xD;
into his grave, and be gathered to his fathers; per-&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
my dear fellow, and having all the conversation t6&#xD;
myself.&#xD;
A. Not at all. You are doing what I wishcd.-7-&#xD;
Go on. Speak out freely. I am anxious to know&#xD;
your real sentiments on these points. You have the&#xD;
fioor. Depend upon it, I shall claim the privilege of&#xD;
replying at length, in my turn.&#xD;
B. Certainly.&#xD;
A. Well, then, let me repeat the third branch of&#xD;
my question, though you have partially answered it&#xD;
already. Do you see nothing in the phenomena of&#xD;
your own heart, whereon to build a faith in immor-&#xD;
tality? Are you conscious of no desires that this&#xD;
world cannot meet, no capacities that it cannot de-&#xD;
velop, no ambition that all its prizes and conquests&#xD;
cannot satisfy?&#xD;
B. Candidly; 1 am not ; that is to say, when 1&#xD;
look at those same phenomena, coolly and deliber-&#xD;
ately, and not through the magnifying glass of self-&#xD;
love. II do not see in myself any 'such thirst after&#xD;
knowledge, truth, or goodness, as this world cannot&#xD;
satisfy, and therefore none on which to base any&#xD;
reasonable claim to a future life. I confess I have&#xD;
a childish curiosity, at times, to know more about&#xD;
my Maker, and of these ~tars around me, and to find&#xD;
out what they are made of; and who occupy them,&#xD;
and to see the crops, and the curiosities, and the&#xD;
amusements, etc. A journey through the sky would&#xD;
be an agreeable novelty, no doubt. But ~hat is it,&#xD;
&#xD;
after all, but a mere traveler's fancy? What poor.&#xD;
man does not, at times, by the same rule, feel a desire&#xD;
to go round the globe, and have a peep at its different&#xD;
nations and kingdoms? But is it a reasonable, or&#xD;
practicable wish? has he any more right to grum-&#xD;
ble, if not indulged in it, than a small boy would&#xD;
have, because he may not be treated to the contents&#xD;
of every toy-shop and confectionery that he may&#xD;
happen to pass in the streets? Are such whims as&#xD;
these to be the basis of a claim to immortality.? If&#xD;
I I~ad a real, ardent wish to lead an arduous, honor-&#xD;
able career of truth and duty, hereafter, it would be&#xD;
one thing; but I detect no such generous ambition&#xD;
in my nature, no, nor any corresponding capacities.&#xD;
Yanity, indeed, may sometimes whisper in my ear,&#xD;
that I have parts and powers above my station ; that&#xD;
I might figure in a loftier theatre and drama than&#xD;
this earth affords; but meanwhile, how abominably&#xD;
I am playing the hi~mble part, the great Manager&#xD;
Ita.~ assigned me! How much knowledge i~ there&#xD;
here, that I have neither the wit nor the will to find&#xD;
out; now many golden opportunities of doing good,&#xD;
that I am too indolent and selfish to avail myself of!&#xD;
And what is worse, 1 see no symptoms of any thing&#xD;
better in myself. I can make cheap and copious&#xD;
confessions, to be sure; but as to any thorough,&#xD;
hearty reform, I have not the courage or grace to&#xD;
attempt it. If I were allowed another life, I should&#xD;
only throw it away as I haye this, so far. And, my&#xD;

thoughts in arabesque, and mosaic, and fresco, and&#xD;
relief-work; with comfortable sofas scattered about,&#xD;
whereon to loll, and to look along the beautiful per-~&#xD;
spectives. and to have his fancy ministered unto by&#xD;
every form and attitude of beauty, and to trace all&#xD;
sorts of delicate analogies~ and to deliver himself of&#xD;
sharp and sparkling criticisms, and to be duly ap-&#xD;
plauded therefore by kindred spirits; a fancy heaven,&#xD;
a paradise of self-conc&amp;amp;it and super-refined sensu-&#xD;
&#xD;
ality. And our other neighbor here, . , the&#xD;
philosopher, as he sometimes presumes to call him-&#xD;
self; will his ideal of a future life bear inspection&#xD;
any better? What is it, but an indulgence in fine&#xD;
talk and dreamy speculation, over sempiternal pipes&#xD;
and coffee; weaving curious theories, and discussing&#xD;
nice problems, not to benefit his brethren or promote&#xD;
"the cause of truth, but for his own gratification, or&#xD;
to win the admiration of brother wits, who have in-&#xD;
telligence enough to keep his faculties agreeably&#xD;
stimulated, but not to shake his sway over their&#xD;
minds: a heaven, not so gross, certainly, but full as&#xD;
selfish as that of the epicure. And that silly wife&#xD;
of his, her heaven seems to be lying abed all day,&#xD;
reading novels; having at the same 'time, neither&#xD;
memory to retain, nor judgment to discriminate be-&#xD;
tween them. Nothing comes amiss to her, from the&#xD;
Lady of the Manor down to Jack Shepherd, from&#xD;
Peregrine Pickle to Salathiel. I dare say she is,&#xD;
this very minute, deep in her ten thousandth, with-&#xD;
out being one whit more wise or witty, than she was&#xD;
when cutting the leaves of her ~rst, a quarter of' a&#xD;
century ago; having' just about as intelligent an a&#xD;
precaution of the contents, as that board-fence op-&#xD;
posite, has of t e long generations of play-bills that&#xD;
have been pas ed upon it, for the last ten years.&#xD;
And will God c descend to humor such whims as&#xD;
these? Will lie perpetuate such a set of fools, fops,&#xD;
profligates, and self-seekers as most of us are&#xD;

What are they? A word or two on this head, and&#xD;
I surrender the floor. Youth, I grant you, is not&#xD;
without its generous impulses, its lofty aspirationS,&#xD;
its dreams of victory over the ignorance and wicked-&#xD;

faith and enthusiasm, its gay visions and gorgeous&#xD;
cloud-palaces. Its very failings are not without&#xD;
their fascinations. But how long do these things&#xD;
last? how long is it before we begin to doubt and&#xD;
criticism our brethren? How soon, alas, does Cufl-&#xD;
tact with the world rob youth alike of its lustre and&#xD;
of its hopes ! How soon does the uncomfbrtabie&#xD;
business of self-inspection begin; the cross-~Iues-&#xD;
tioning of each desire and motive; the constant dis-&#xD;
covery of latent evil, in our own hearts, and those&#xD;
of others ; the dreary task of analysis; the pulling&#xD;
to pieces of all the bright creations that before so&#xD;
engaged and cheered us, and the erection of far dif-&#xD;
ferent structures in their stead, where suspicion sits&#xD;

so to me. I3ut why multiply words? I can ofily&#xD;
repeat, by way of conclusion to this feeble reply to&#xD;
your questions that the more I think of all these&#xD;

wonder, my friend, that you are a dull, moddy, soli-&#xD;

such a horrible creed as this. That it is utterly un-&#xD;
sound. that it blasphemes God, that it libels man, that&#xD;
4t stands in the way of all true progress and peace,&#xD;
are. I think, demonstrable propositions. I may&#xD;
not have the ability to demonstrate them to your&#xD;
satisfaction. I certainly do not propose to under-&#xD;
ta~ e any such task to-day. Still I should like to be&#xD;
heard in reply, when we meet again. I should like&#xD;
to splinter a lance, humble champion that ii am, in&#xD;
behalf of the blessed cause of Faith and hope, and&#xD;
see if I can make no impression on this frightful&#xD;
skepticism of yours.&#xD;

this discussion was not of my seeking. If my opin-&#xD;

to exchange them for something better. Ii will hear&#xD;

CONVERSATION III,&#xD;
&#xD;
A. AND now, my dear friend, I propose, to re-&#xD;
ply, somewhat at length, and in order, to the re-&#xD;
marks that fell from you yesterday. You began,&#xD;
you remember, by saying that even if you were to&#xD;
live hereafter, and be transferred to other worlds,&#xD;
you felt n'o confidence that you would be a gainer&#xD;
thereby; that this world and man, bad as they were,&#xD;
might, after all, be God's master-works, etc., etc.&#xD;
Now I must say, this notion of yours seems to me&#xD;
altogether fanciful and unsound, opposed to all that&#xD;
science teaches us about the 1~niverse, utterly op-&#xD;
posed to all our ideas of proportion and harmony.&#xD;
had you started prPcisely the opposite doubt, you&#xD;
would have been far nearer the mark. I should&#xD;
haye put the question thus Can it be that this&#xD;
earth, filled as it is with life and beauty, crowded as&#xD;
it is with specimens of creative wisdom and good-&#xD;
&#xD;
CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
ness, is, after all, anything more than a mere intro-&#xD;
duction to grander things to come? or that man&#xD;
with all his marvellous gifts, can furnish us with any&#xD;
but a very feeble image of the powers and attributes&#xD;
of grander performers on grander theatres of ac-&#xD;
tion? I should feel as a stranger would, standing&#xD;
before the sculptured portal of some vast cathedral;&#xD;
not, that the architect had exhausted all his skill&#xD;
on the outside, but all the more eager to explore the&#xD;
world of splendor and majesty within, of which it&#xD;
was thearnest. If this planet of ours, with its&#xD;
scanty proportions, and its narrow circuit through&#xD;
space, is yet so laden with lovely and precious&#xD;
things, what must the treasures and splendors be,&#xD;
of the hundred-fold greater Jupiter? If a summer&#xD;
evening on earth be so charming, with its soft moon-&#xD;
light and lustrous stars, what sort of a spectacle&#xD;
must that be which is nightly presented to the fa-&#xD;
vored inhabitants of Saturn? And why may they&#xD;
not have a correspondingly greater power of appre-&#xD;
ciation and comprehension of that spectacle? have&#xD;
faculties oi~ mind and body, compared with which&#xD;
those even of a Milton are faint and feeble? Why&#xD;
may not the science, and art, and poetry, and faith&#xD;
of Saturn, have a corresponding grandeur, anti beau-&#xD;
ty, and fervor, which we humble occupants of earth&#xD;
can hardly imagine? This it seems to me, would&#xD;
be the more fair and philosophical way of putting&#xD;
this question. Again, this idea of yours is, as I&#xD;

said at the time, directly opposed to the promises of&#xD;
the Bible. You immediately replied, however, that&#xD;
you had no faith in those promises, or in their divine&#xD;
origin; and you straightway began to draw a most&#xD;
unbecoming and profane parallel (excuse me, but I&#xD;
must call it so) between the-Scriptures and the plays&#xD;
of Shakspeare. -Had the poet himself been by to&#xD;
have heard it, he would have been the first to frown&#xD;
indignantly at any such comparison, or at the&#xD;
thought of naming all the uninspired writers of&#xD;
earth put together, in the same breath with that&#xD;
blessed book. Do, my dear friend, revive your re-&#xD;
collections somewhat of those same parables and&#xD;
epistles you spoke of so slightingly, ay, and of the&#xD;
Psalms and Prophets, before venturing on any such&#xD;
criticism again. I will not dwell lorig upon this&#xD;
point. You say you have read several of the writ-&#xD;
ings -of the -more illustrious champions of Chris-.&#xD;
tianity, but without being convinced by them. Why&#xD;

meet the great crying want of humanity, the only s lu-&#xD;
tion of and balm for the troubles and sorrows of life ;&#xD;
what have I to say, on these and kindred topics, that&#xD;
has not been a hundred fold better said already?~&#xD;
Thc idea of rejecting such a revelation as this, is to&#xD;
my mind inconceivably painful and horrible ; and&#xD;
the idea of criticising, or finding fault with it, be-&#xD;
cause it contains things not quite in accordance with&#xD;
our humble notions of the sublime and beautiful, or&#xD;
because it contains puzzles too deep for our frail wits,&#xD;
seems to me the 'very height of impertinence and&#xD;
presumption. As well might the rescued sailor&#xD;
presume to criticise the vessel that had just snatched&#xD;
him from destruction, or the prophet of God to have&#xD;
sneered at the very chariot that bore him to heaven.&#xD;
But to proceed. I next asked you, if you saw no-&#xD;
thing in the great volume of nature, on which to&#xD;
build a rational faith in immortality. Was it not&#xD;
so ?&#xD;

call in our senses as witnesses on the side of skepti-&#xD;
cism and materialism, and to argue from their imper-&#xD;
fections, against the existence of all phenomena be-&#xD;
yond their grasp? These same phenomena of death,&#xD;
this giving up the ghost as we call it, this wondrous&#xD;
process, far too subtle and delicate for our feeble per-&#xD;
ceptions, how simple an operation may it not be to&#xD;
more curiously and rarely organized being; and jus&#xD;
as palpable a matter of observation and calculation&#xD;
to him, as to us the beating of the pulse, or the&#xD;
changes of the countenance. But, my dear friend,&#xD;
does not a moment's reflection teach us, how utterly&#xD;
unsuitable any such organization would be for us?&#xD;
Suppose such a revelation y'ere made to our senses;&#xD;
suppose we could, trace the flight of the spirit from&#xD;
the bed of death, till it were lost in the depths of&#xD;
space, would we be the gainers by any such addition&#xD;
to our knowledge? Wouldn't it only serve to unfit&#xD;
us the more for the duties of life?. Why, all the&#xD;
world would stand gazing curiously at the heavens,&#xD;
or would be hurrying away in pursuit of the depart-&#xD;
ed ones; earth would los~ all charm for us, would&#xD;
soon be abandoned to neglect and decay. Just as&#xD;
any more explicit statements in God~s word* would&#xD;
have been inappropriate, so any more light shed&#xD;
upon our senses on these points, would have only im-&#xD;
paired our affection for those about us, and have&#xD;
taken ~way the due interest from our tasks and rel-&#xD;
ish from our enjoyments, here. Who can help see-&#xD;

in4 that we have just the organization, alike in its&#xD;
strength an(lrn its weakness, for our position; the&#xD;
organization that makes us at once the appropriate&#xD;
and willing instruments for carrying out God's de-&#xD;
signs on earth? And is it not fair to infer, from this&#xD;
exquisite adaptation of means to ends here, that when&#xD;
we take our leave of earth, we shall receive a neW&#xD;
endowment of faculties, just as felicitously contrived&#xD;
for the new and loftier scenes and employment that&#xD;
await us? isn't it quite as reasonable a view of the&#xD;
subject as yours, to say the least?&#xD;
B. Perhaps it is; at the same time there seems to&#xD;
me to be a most uncomfortable preponderance of hy-&#xD;
pothesis over fact, in all such speculations. But I&#xD;
must not interrupt you. You were to be the talker,&#xD;
you know, I the listener, to -day.&#xD;
A. Well then, let me say a word or two more on&#xD;
this point. The more we examine this same argu-&#xD;
ment of yours, which would ignore the existence of&#xD;
an hereafter, upon the imperfect testimony of the&#xD;
senses, the more and more untenable does it appear.&#xD;
For how many processes are going on continually&#xD;
around us, just as much without the range of those&#xD;
senses, as is the translation of the soul in death. I&#xD;
am not speaking of the tricks of jugglers, or of cu-&#xD;
rious experiments in science, but of the most familiar&#xD;
mental operations that every moment bears witness&#xD;
to; that marvellous process, for instance, whereby&#xD;
a few words ~ung or spoken will melt an audience to&#xD;

what light, I ask, do tit C senses sited upon these&#xD;
phenomena? The effects are ever before us, but the&#xD;
processes themselves, are they not as completely be-&#xD;
yond the cognizance of those senses as the soul's&#xD;
flight is in the dying hour? Certainly they are&#xD;
and the only difference that I can see in the two&#xD;
eases is this, that in the one the effects are necessa-&#xD;
rily presented to us, for our well-being and guidance&#xD;
through life, while in the other, they are as wisely&#xD;
withheld from us, because the perception of them&#xD;
would utterly unfit us for all hfe's duties and enjoy.&#xD;
ments. So it seems to me, and I should therefore&#xD;
think it just about as i~nreasonable, to call in ques-&#xD;

body, in the act of dying, as I would to call in ques.&#xD;

trace with these eyes the flight ~ its mysterious&#xD;
messenger along the wires. Let me then, in conclu-&#xD;

asked you, how you could reconcile the daily occur-&#xD;

unsatisfactory, a most gloomy one. You quarreled&#xD;

knew, God might be a capricious and cruel being;&#xD;
that you had just as much right to take that ground&#xD;
as I the opposite; that neither of us had any data&#xD;
for any intelligent opinion on the subject, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
You threw doubt on that great cardinal truth of&#xD;
truths, in which the mind has sought refuge; in all&#xD;
ages, the goodness of the Creator. You would de-&#xD;

chained to their desks, prisoners in sultry cities,&#xD;

delightedly on lake and mountain and waterfall;&#xD;
you, who have been surrounded by havingng grain-&#xD;
fields, and fruit-laden trees, and the music of birds&#xD;
and bees, and the sweet company of flowers, scattere(i&#xD;
o'er fields and hillsides, or daintily arrayed in gardens;&#xD;
you, my friend, to preach such a doctrine as this,&#xD;

been thus inscribed all around you, in letters of light,&#xD;
&#xD;

heaven; I look with far different eyes upon these&#xD;

tell me, not of heaven's unkindness, but of my own&#xD;
unworthiness; of my own frail, sinful nature; of my&#xD;
tardy, scanty thanks for all this munificence; they&#xD;
bid me awake from my sloth and self-indulgence, and&#xD;
be hearty and diligent in my duties, and so earn an&#xD;

call God a tyrant, and the next you attribute all the&#xD;

your comfort and well-being? But I ~will not stop&#xD;
*to argue such a point as this. You then went on to&#xD;
throw suspicion on the feeling itself, which leads us&#xD;
all instinctively to refer to another life, for the solu-&#xD;
tion of the mysteries and sorrows of this. What is&#xD;
it, after all, you asked, but mere mortified vanity or&#xD;
wounded pride, or disappointed ambition? A pretty&#xD;
basis, indeed, to build a faith upon! Yes, 'you were&#xD;
for resolving it all into the mere idle clamor of chil-&#xD;
dren at having their sports stopped, their toys taken&#xD;
from them; the mere remonstrance of self-love,&#xD;
vexed and indignant at being cut short in the midst&#xD;
of its follies and indulgences. As unjust in this, to&#xD;
your brethren, as before to your Maker: as if no&#xD;
noble career wais ever interrupted by death, no laud-&#xD;
able ambition thwarted, no holy zeal for others' good&#xD;
untimely snatched away from its labors, no pure and&#xD;
lofty genius cut down in the morning of its triumphs,&#xD;
no single case ever made out of a fair claim on God's&#xD;
equity, for light or recompense hereafter. Such an&#xD;
explanation belies humanity. Take the, case, too, of&#xD;
the poor penitent, who from his bed of death looks&#xD;
back upon a misspent lifp, who feels how miserably&#xD;
he has fallen below 'that ideal of excellence that is&#xD;
yet ever present to him, who in the anguish and bit-&#xD;
terness of his heart prays God yet to give him a&#xD;
chance to redeem his character; not to be released&#xD;
from punishment, but after the dread penalty is&#xD;

this? Will you explain it all away into a mere&#xD;
childish whim, or morbid vanity, or selfish shrinking&#xD;
from annihilation? I do not accept any such inter-&#xD;
pretation of the matter; nor do I believe that God&#xD;
will turn a deaf ear to such a claim as this; still&#xD;
less to the cries of innocent suffering, or the prayers&#xD;
of a true ambition, and thus cruelly shut the door in&#xD;
thA'aces of His poor children. As to the idea you&#xD;
suggested, that this world may have been construct-&#xD;

preparation for loftier scenes, but as a mere puppet-&#xD;

old, worn-out panorama in a museui~,to make way&#xD;

sonable, it seems to me the veriest caprice of an&#xD;

explanation quite as~admissible 'as any other, and&#xD;
that we were utterly in the dark as to all Goa's&#xD;
plans and motives all opinions (so you said), are&#xD;
alike worthless on the subject; what do we know&#xD;

ignorant captives, utterly at God's mercy; what can&#xD;
we do but grumble, or else bear in grim silence,&#xD;

reading of the text of the great volume of provi-&#xD;

these sentiments, as being alike unreasonable a&#xD;

and from grumbler turned cynic. You intro(luee(l,&#xD;
you remember, a philosophical gentleman on the car-&#xD;

say that he had far more of the squalor of the tub,&#xD;
than of the dignity of the academy, about l~im. his&#xD;
was a very pleasant, off-hand solution of the prob-&#xD;
1cm of evil. He thought this world explained itself;&#xD;
on the whole, quite satisfactorily, withQut bothering&#xD;
our brains about an~ ~ther; that the inequalities&#xD;
anti accidents of life resolved themselves away into&#xD;
pretty much nothing, when critically investigated&#xD;
that the punishment of having to take care of one's&#xD;
property, was about equal to the blessing of owning&#xD;
it; that an ear for music was the source df quite as&#xD;
much torture as pleasure to its owner; that such&#xD;
casualties as fhe burning of the Henry Clay, for in-&#xD;
stance. or the sinking of the Atlaut~c, far from&#xD;
being the themes of lamentation, or of indignant re-&#xD;
monstrance, were en the whole, blessings, as tending&#xD;
to rid society of far more nuisances and villains,&#xD;
*1&#xD;
than they deprived it of valuable citizens; and that&#xD;
the sufferers themselves, were they reasonable,&#xD;
&#xD;
WOUl(I take that view of the suhject. Ito would say&#xD;
to one of' those sufferers, whose heart might still be&#xD;
bleeding for the loss of some (lear w~fo or (laughter,&#xD;
"Cheer up, my friend, cheer up; true, you have&#xD;
been suddenly deprived by this disaster of loved&#xD;
companions; but hark'ye, a word in your ear. Krrnw&#xD;
then, that when this accident occurred, there was a&#xD;
the fo&#xD;
gang of counterfeiters on   re part of the boat,&#xD;
and that every rascal of' thorn has perished, together ~&#xD;
with the implements of their accursed trade. Many&#xD;
similar facts connected with this occurrence have&#xD;
also come to light, all going to show, in the aggre-&#xD;
gate, a most decided balance of good, with which it&#xD;
ought to be credited on the books of the community,&#xD;
and which fairly earns for the individuals who&#xD;
caused it, the title of benefactors. how unreasona-&#xD;
ble, then, how unpatriotic your grief! So cheer up,&#xD;
dry your tears, and be a man." Such would be the&#xD;
consolations of your philosophical friend. Oh. out&#xD;
upon such shallow sophistry, such hideous mockery.1&#xD;
as this! In the same heartkss, flippant way did he&#xD;
speak of all life's bereavements~ Death was a kind&#xD;

as a witness against him; that epitaph so full of&#xD;
pathos, informed as it is, with such an intense hu-&#xD;
manity.&#xD;
Good friend! for Je~us"sake forbear&#xD;
To dig the dust enclosed here.&#xD;
Blest be the man that spares these stones,&#xD;
And cursed be he that moves these bones.&#xD;
The poet is not here speaking in his o~vn behalf&#xD;
merely; no, he is pleading for the great family of&#xD;
man, pleading for the repose and sanctity of the&#xD;
grave, and invoking a world's denunciation upon its&#xD;
ruthless violators. But, my friend, to return to our&#xD;
philosopher; I deny utterly his statement that the&#xD;
world generally are disbelievers in immortality, and&#xD;
are merely playing upon each other, in their profes-&#xD;
ions of faith. I wonder how any reasonable man&#xD;
could ever make it. It seems to me a most outra-&#xD;
geous libel on n~ankind. The annals of every age&#xD;
and nation belie it; nay, the experience of every&#xD;
human heart, from Adam's down, if honestly set&#xD;
forth, I believe, would demonstrate its falsity. Yes,&#xD;
the most perverse of reasoners, the veriest hair-&#xD;
splitter that ever abused his understanding~ cannot&#xD;
run away from the great cardinal truths of God, and&#xD;
immortality, and accountability; truths coeval with&#xD;
man; truths never expounded, indeed, in their sub-&#xD;
lime purity and simplicity till Christ came on&#xD;
earth; still, recognized alike in the rudest rites&#xD;

less, in both, by unworthy conceptions and by cruel&#xD;
and obscene ceremonies; still, shining conspicuous&#xD;
through th~in all, the essential, vital parts of every&#xD;
creed under heaven; truths, without which, the&#xD;
world would seem the most pitiful of snarls, the earth&#xD;
itself the merest mass of rubbish; without which,&#xD;
there would have been nothing for history to record,&#xD;
or art to commemorate; nay, all the transitions of&#xD;
life, all its loves and feuds and excitements would&#xD;
have been of no more interest or consequence than&#xD;
the amours of so many cats, or the squabbles of so&#xD;
many curs. But I have not patience to discuss a&#xD;
point, that seems to me so clear as this. There was&#xD;
still, my dear friend, as you will remember, a part of&#xD;
my question, which you did not undertake to answer.&#xD;
I mean that which referred to the unpunished crimi-&#xD;
nals of earth, and their poor, tortured, slaughtered,&#xD;
violated victims. How were they to be disposed~ of?&#xD;
This most painful and puzzling part of the problem&#xD;
of life, how was it to be solved? You were silent,&#xD;
but your philosophical friend undertook to put the&#xD;
matter at rest, in a most off-hand and comprehensive&#xD;
way, to be sure. He said, that all these evils were&#xD;
to he laid at man~s door, not God's; they were sim-&#xD;
ply the result of our abuse of our freedom; God had&#xD;
given us the capacities and the materials for happi-&#xD;
ness; had given us the light of nature and of reason;&#xD;

we had hut to follow them, and farewell, at once, to&#xD;
the crimes, diseases, sorrows of the race; every man&#xD;
would be happy; every man would have length of&#xD;
days and abundance of comforts, in fact, all that his&#xD;
Maker ever intended to give him; arid therefore, so&#xD;
far from having a right or a disposition to grumble,&#xD;
if' no other world were vouchsafed him, he would still&#xD;
be a contented, thankful debtor for the blessing of&#xD;
this. Plausible statement, truly ! Why, look aI~ it&#xD;
a moment. According to this reasoner, God has had&#xD;
nothing to do with the world, since creation morning.&#xD;
After making man and earth, and the laws that were&#xD;
to govern them, he 'has turned us adrift, to look out&#xD;
for ourselves. Every thing that has happened on&#xD;
the planet since, is of man's doing. Let him be duly&#xD;
credited then, with all the blessings, and debited with&#xD;
all the evils of life. GodTs not accountable for any&#xD;
of these things. His care and bounty were exhaust..&#xD;
ed on the work of creation. As to any subsequent&#xD;
interference or supervision, save through these same&#xD;
unbending laws of nature, there is no such thing.-&#xD;
Ask not then, poor sinner or sufferer that' thou art,&#xD;
for any light or help or re&amp;amp;ompense from above, for&#xD;
this must be the reply to thy petition: 'I have&#xD;
nothing to do with the matter. I refer thee back to&#xD;
thy brethren. In their hands alone is thy destiny.&#xD;
I made man. I gave him the hints and the mate-&#xD;
rials for happiness, and I left liini to himself. If he&#xD;
hath not availed himself of them, tax not me with the&#xD;
&#xD;
consequences. I have not interfered. I will not in-&#xD;
terfere. Man must work out the problem for him-&#xD;
self. Call not on me, then, in thy distresses. Ask&#xD;
me not, to hurl my lightning against the transgres-&#xD;
sor, or to stay the assassin~ s hand, or to stop the&#xD;
breath of the pestilence, or to arrest the subtler poi-&#xD;
son of the slanderer. These things are not of my&#xD;
doing. As human guilt and folly caused, so must&#xD;
human wisdom and goodness relieve or compensate&#xD;
for them. Back then, to thy brethren, and impor-&#xD;
tune me not with thy vain appeals? Horrible as&#xD;
this sounds, yet what other answer to his prayer,&#xD;
could the poor sinner have, according to this theory?&#xD;
Away, away with it! Who that hath any heart or&#xD;
soul about him, can tolerate it for a moment? A&#xD;
doctrine utterly at war, not only with all the state-&#xD;
)&#xD;
ments of scripture, but with all the analogies of na-&#xD;
ture. What, the Being who created this beautifpi&#xD;
earth of ours, who hath arrayed it in such robes of&#xD;
splendor, who hath stocked it with such boundless&#xD;
varieties of life, who hath contrived all this exquisite&#xD;
machinery for making it comfortable and agreeable&#xD;
to his children, who hath expended such a world of&#xD;
care and love upon us all, from imperial man, down&#xD;
to the vagrant sparrow; He turn his back upon this&#xD;
blessed work of his, from the very moment of its con-&#xD;
summation, and never since vouchsafe a single kind&#xD;
look, never condescend to interfere, with a solitary&#xD;
act, Or even suggestion, for its welfare! It seems to&#xD;

me that the bare statement of such a proposition as&#xD;
this, sufficiently demonstrates its absurdity. Far,&#xD;
far better believe the opposite doctrine, that there is&#xD;
no event in life, however insignificant or repulsive we&#xD;
may deem it, that is' not controlled by God. Yes,&#xD;
with all its liability to misinterpretation and abuse ;&#xD;
with all the excuses that it may seem 'to furnish to&#xD;
the criminal, with all the scope that it may give to&#xD;
the shallow and presumptuous reader of God's book&#xD;
of providence, how much better is it than this other&#xD;
notion, which thus isolates us from our Maker, thus&#xD;
damps the spirit of prayer, stops the mouth alike of&#xD;
thanksgiving and of penitence, banishes from earth&#xD;
alike its guardian and avenging angels, and consigns&#xD;
it to a sullen, wretched independence. I confess, my&#xD;
friend, he longer I live, the more and more convinced&#xD;
I 'am of the perpetual supervision of the Almighty,&#xD;
of his perpetual interference with human freedom.&#xD;
How far this interference was decreed from the be-&#xD;
ginning ; .how far the Creator may ee fit to modify&#xD;
his plans from time to time ; how fthe mysteries&#xD;
of foreknowledge and free-will may be reconciled to&#xD;
each other ; these, and such like knotty themes, are&#xD;
not for us poor laymen. We must humbly leave&#xD;
them to the 'grave and reverend doctors of the church.&#xD;
And even of these, how few seem willing or compe-&#xD;
tent to discuss them aright, to bring tQ them the pro-&#xD;

there have been, scattered over the pages of history,&#xD;

corded in God's holy word, but in those innumerable&#xD;
ones that are continually occurring about us, lgt, for&#xD;
wise ends, hidden from our sight. I believe, not only&#xD;
that God talked with Adam and with Noah, that&#xD;
angels conversed with Abraham, and ministered&#xD;
unto Hlaga r in the wilderness, that the ravens were&#xD;
sent with food to the prophet, in a word, all those&#xD;
touching, those beautiful stories of holy writ, but. that&#xD;
unseen spirits guided the bark of the great discov-.&#xD;
erer, and saw the Mayflower safe to her haven, and&#xD;
kept off the venom of the pestilence from the self,&#xD;
devoting philanthropist, and turned aside the death-.&#xD;
*shafts from our own patriot-hero ; that they are con-&#xD;
stantly -doing "God's bidding on earth, constantly&#xD;
modifying or controlling human conduct; and that,&#xD;
while many of these interpositions sufficiently explain&#xD;
and vindicate themselves, in this life, all will be made&#xD;
clear hereafter. Call me credulous and visionary,&#xD;
if you will. I repeat it, I would far rather believe&#xD;
all these things, than that opposite doctrine, which&#xD;
would deprive us of the light of God's countenance,&#xD;
which would leave man to his-own wilfulness and&#xD;
ignorance, which would substitute for our Father in&#xD;
heaven, a system of inflexible laws, beneficent in the&#xD;
main, of' course, but still ne'er tempered with equity,&#xD;
that no prayer can ever bend, no plea avert. All&#xD;
ou best affections and aspirations seem to me to&#xD;
favor such belief; and to justify the expectations that&#xD;
all these mysteries of the divine government, however '&#xD;

(lark and painful many of them may seem here, will&#xD;

accept your philosopher's interpretation of this mat-&#xD;
ter. So far from this world's explaining itself; as he&#xD;
would have it, it seems- to me that it is only when we&#xD;
have left it, that we shall begin rightly to comnpre-&#xD;
hend it ; just as its physical features and beautiful&#xD;
movements through the heavens, could only be fairly&#xD;
perceived and appreciated, when surveyed from be-&#xD;
yond it. And as I cannot but cherish. the hope of&#xD;
being, in God's good season, endowed with an organi-&#xD;
zation, that will enable me to behold and enjoy a&#xD;
panorama so magnificent, -so do I humbly look for-&#xD;
ward to* an intellectual capacity, with which to pene&#xD;
trate the meaning and the moral of the great drama&#xD;
of human existence. But, my dear friend. I must&#xD;
not abuse my privileg , 'and tax too much your&#xD;
patience.&#xD;
B. Not at all, not .at all. I am listening with&#xD;

means convinced of the soundness of your reason -&#xD;

earnestness is certainly entitled to my respect, if&#xD;
your arguments may not convince my understand-&#xD;

A. Well then, allow me a few words upon the&#xD;
last part of my question. I asked you, my dear&#xD;
friend, if you saw nothing in your own nature, where-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8087-00000049"/>&#xD;
on to build a faith in immortality ; no aspirations,&#xD;
no capacities, that all the acquisitions, all the expe-&#xD;
rience of this life failed to meet or satisfy. No, said&#xD;
you, no ; nothing that will bear inspection ; nothing&#xD;
that does not resolve itself into a mere traveler's&#xD;
fancy, or schoolboy's whim, or the merest exaggera-&#xD;
tions of self love ; no honest thirst after knowledge,&#xD;
no real desire to do good ; nothing, in short, either&#xD;
in the way of power or of disposition to make my-&#xD;
self useful hereafter, that God would condescend to&#xD;
recognize as a claim to a future life., And in speak-&#xD;
ing thus for yourself, you insisted that you were&#xD;
speaking for ninety-nine, hundredths of the human&#xD;
family, in all ages ;. that they uniformly avoided the&#xD;
thought of an hereafter, when they could ; and that&#xD;
when their minds were forced'in that direction, their&#xD;
conceptions were of the most gross and unworthy&#xD;
character. You proceeded to illustrate your remark&#xD;
by some most biting and unreasonably severe (as I&#xD;
thought) criticisms upon your neighbors ; and you&#xD;
concluded by asking, will God humor the whims of&#xD;
~creatures like these ; will lie perpetuate such a set&#xD;
of sensualists and .self-seekei-s ? No, no, no. We&#xD;
neither desire nor deserve immortality. What a re-&#xD;
ply ! -You 'could not have beenr in earnest, mny&#xD;
friend, in making it ; in thus belying your own bet-&#xD;

so.&#xD;
A. And I say, that such a doctrine is to me in-&#xD;

consider it an atrocious libel on humanity. I take&#xD;
directly opposite ground. I say there is no human&#xD;
being so sunk in vice and ignorance, but there is&#xD;
something precious and sacred about him, which,&#xD;
however we may overlook or deride it, God fails not'&#xD;
to recognize, will not fail, in His own good season, to&#xD;
ripen and develop, unto glorious issues. There is&#xD;
nothing about us, thus absolutely worthless. It is&#xD;
our own want of perception that makes us thus decry&#xD;
,and condemn human nature. -Just as the child sees&#xD;
nothing in the collection of the mineralogist, but a&#xD;
mere congregation of worthless and misshapen stones,&#xD;
so we thoughtless, ill-judging children of men, pass&#xD;

audience and of judgment, is nothing more than a&#xD;
mere heap of rubbish, a mere aggregation of matter,&#xD;

I must not quote Scripture, my friend, on this point,&#xD;

the more their properties are revealed to us, the&#xD;
more and more do thpy show forth His wisdom and&#xD;
bounty. To the eye of science, there is nothing in-&#xD;

knowledge thus sct before him to any practical ac-&#xD;
count? Such an illustration seems to mc neither&#xD;
irreverent nor unjust. What is this world but a&#xD;
magnificent and thoroughly appointed institution for&#xD;
the development of human souls? Take away the&#xD;
life to come, and all this training, all these elaborate&#xD;
and munificent arrangements, what a perfect mock-&#xD;
cry are they! Who can endure a doctrine that&#xD;
leads to such absurd results, that thus isolates this&#xD;
earth from the rest of creation, instead of making it&#xD;
a link in a glorious chain, a primary school in a&#xD;
grand scheme of education? I believe it to be such,&#xD;
and If believe that we shall all, as, under God's good&#xD;
guidance, we go on advancing to higher and higher&#xD;
steps of this spiritual' development, come to look&#xD;
back on it with the same affectionate veneration,&#xD;
with which the man looks back in after years, upon&#xD;
the old school-house where he learnt his first lessons.&#xD;
You may call all this very fanciful and visionary.&#xD;
Be it so. Any thing rather than this horrible skep-&#xD;
ticisin of yours. Yps, I do cherish all sorts of glo-&#xD;
rious expectations, in the 'life to come. I do believe&#xD;
that all the mighty intellects of earth will go on, in&#xD;
other worlds, continually gaining in vigor and re-&#xD;
sources, and advancing from loftier to loftier careers&#xD;
of usefulness. I believe that the great jurists of&#xD;
earth, the Marshalls, the Storys, the Rents, will&#xD;
meet hereafter their learned brethren of other lands&#xD;
and ages, ay, and planets ; will confer together; will&#xD;

develop together new and loftier systems of juris-&#xD;

elder brother Coke, in some other sphere, and talk&#xD;
over with him, not merely the rule in Shelley's case,&#xD;
and other pleasant old subtleties of the law of iRcal&#xD;
Property on earth, but newer and grander systems;&#xD;
or discuss higher and more comprehensivee doctrines&#xD;
of commercial law, with his brother Mansfield, thaLn&#xD;
they ever dreamt of in their earthly tribunals ?-&#xD;
Consider such a suggestion flighty and absurd, if you&#xD;
will; and yet what is there more strange in it, than&#xD;
that two such intellects are permitted to confer to&#xD;
gather, here below,~either in person or through their&#xD;
writings? Till you can get over, or explain away,&#xD;
the miraculous realities of this life, call me not ro-&#xD;
mantic, for indi~lging in such anticipations, as to the&#xD;
next. I believe too, that a Shakspeare will study&#xD;
hearts, and portray characters, and build the lofty&#xD;
rhyme, for the delight of other worlds; that a Milton&#xD;
will be inspired by grander scenes and contempla-.&#xD;
tionsto the production of still grander poems; that&#xD;
a Newton will go on, enlarging and expanding his&#xD;
researches, from more central and commanding points&#xD;
of the universe; that a Raphael is destined to em-'&#xD;
body far loftier thoughts and lovelier visions, in&#xD;
brighter worlds. Tell me not that a Michael Angelo&#xD;
is to rear no more stately dom~s, or more gorgeous&#xD;
palaces than those lie left behind him; or that a&#xD;
Beethoven is to compose no more glorious music, to&#xD;

borne away from us, the sage, the statesman, the&#xD;
patriot, he who was so gi'and in the forum, so majes-&#xD;
tic in the senate, so sublime on the hallowed spots of'&#xD;
his country's history; tell me not that that august&#xD;
soul is to slumber in oblivion forever; that it is never&#xD;
more to impart or receive wisdom in other spheres;&#xD;
never to confer with its great brother-spi4ts of&#xD;
Greece and Rome and England, or with those who&#xD;
have swayed the destinies of other planets. Tell me&#xD;
not, either, that these, and all the great spirits, who&#xD;
have here labored unto mighty issues, are not&#xD;
permitted to return at times, and behold the&#xD;
blessed fruit of their toils; that a Washingtou&#xD;
may not look down upon the magnificent republic&#xD;
that he founded, or a Columbus see the results of&#xD;
his discoveries, or a Fulton behold the ceaseless,&#xD;
world-wide miracles wrought by his inventions4 Say&#xD;
not that this notion is unscriptural, either; that it&#xD;
interferes with God's moral government. Not so.&#xD;
Let the claims of divine justice be met. Let every&#xD;
human soul, however regally or humbly endowed,&#xD;
pay to the full the penalty that its errors and its&#xD;
sins have earned. We ask no exemption from mer-&#xD;
ited punishments. No, no. Givo us a future life.&#xD;
Give us the sufferings that are fairly ours, e'en to&#xD;
the last drop of bitterness, the last groan of anguish&#xD;
and remorse; but oh, defraud us not of the duties,&#xD;

the privileges, the glories that are beyond them. I&#xD;
need not stop, my friend, to dwell upon the blight-&#xD;
ing influence of this doctrine of yours upon the af-&#xD;
f'ections; to say how it renders all the moral disci~&#xD;
pline of life as unmeaning and worthless as it does&#xD;

and kindred into a mere animal attachment; how it&#xD;
robs the mementoes of that love of all lustre and&#xD;
significance; what a perfect mockery it makes of&#xD;
all the tears, and vows, and prayers we offer at their&#xD;
graves. What, tell me that the Thother who bore&#xD;
me, the wife of my bosom, the children of my hopes,&#xD;
have all crumbled away into nothingness; have be-&#xD;
come less significant, in God's eyes, than the clods&#xD;
of the valley that cover them; do you really, my&#xD;
friend, wish to persuade me of any such doctrine as&#xD;
this? Tell the mother, that the son who has just&#xD;
been taken from her, in the pride of his manhood&#xD;
her prop, her comforter, flie delight of her eyes, is&#xD;
to be hidden from her sight forever; that there is to&#xD;
be no heavenly recognition, no interchange of ~ym-&#xD;
pathies or endearments hereafter; or that that other&#xD;
poor son of hers, who has neglected alike her and&#xD;
her counsels, who has disgraced his name, and has&#xD;
just terminated a loathsome life by an ignominious&#xD;
death ; tell her ihat that wretched soul is to have no&#xD;
opportunity of redeeming itself of yet blotting out&#xD;
the memory of its crimes on earth, in some worthy&#xD;
career hereafter; tell the friend who has just heard&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
of the death of one with whom he parted in anger,&#xD;
that there are no such things as blessed explana-&#xD;
tions, and peace-makings, and the renewals of earth-&#xD;
ly vows, in brighter worlds; that it is all a mere de-&#xD;
lusion, an idle dream of fancy.-Oh, what heart can&#xD;
listen to such suggestions as these 3 There is, there&#xD;
is a life beyond the grave; there is a glorious desti-&#xD;
ny yet in store, even for the vilest sinners. Yes, it&#xD;
is pleasant to think that the veriest monsters of&#xD;
earth, whose names degrade and deface the pages&#xD;
of history, and must ever be associated here with all&#xD;
that is infamous and detestable, have already, per-&#xD;
haps, become burning and shining lights elsewhere&#xD;
in God's universe; that our Neros and Borgias are&#xD;
even now, perhaps, playing the blessed parts of Fen-&#xD;
dons and Howards, in other worlds. You will of&#xD;
course call me credulous and fanciful; and yet, why&#xD;
seek to rob me of a thought that has in it so much&#xD;
of comfort and encouragement, so much of stimulus&#xD;
to honest effort? But enough of this. You went&#xD;
on to say, that the phenomena of advancing years,&#xD;
as you watched them, in your own heart, and in&#xD;
those of your brethren, only served the more to con-&#xD;
firm your skepticism and indifference about the fu-&#xD;
ture. You would have it, that every added hour&#xD;
of life took away something from the ingenuousness&#xD;
of youth, and from the loftiness of its aims; that&#xD;
we all became more sordid and narrow-minded, with&#xD;
every step we took towards the grave.; the standard&#xD;

this very point ; in which he seems disposedd to coin-&#xD;

of the mountain-top, and not of the valley. It&#xD;
seems somewhat subtle and elaborate, at first, but a&#xD;
second reading (as ever in his works), makes it lumi-&#xD;
nous with wisdom and beauty. Allow me to repeat&#xD;
it; and so take leave of the subject:&#xD;
"Rightly is it said&#xD;
That Man descends into the V~z1e of years;&#xD;

CONVERSATION IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
A. THERE are seine other points, dear B., on&#xD;
which I confess II should like to have a little more&#xD;
free and full interchange of opinions with you; not,&#xD;
you will believe me, from any mere idle wish to.hear&#xD;
the sound of my own voice; still less, I trust, from&#xD;
any presumptuous expectation of being able to over-&#xD;
throw your doctrines; but, as I said before, because&#xD;
I really think such discussions, if conducted iii a&#xD;
courteous and truth-seeking spirit, may be made&#xD;
mutually profitable. So, if brother C., here, has no&#xD;
objections, we will renew our colloquy. 'Perhaps he&#xD;
may be willing to act as umpire between us.&#xD;
C. Oh, no, no; far from me be any such pre-&#xD;
sumption as that. I will be a cheerful listener, how-&#xD;
ever, and may perhaps venture on a stray remark or&#xD;
two, myself. But what was the particular point,&#xD;
you proposed to discuss, this evening?&#xD;
A. W~i1, let me briefly explain myself. Our&#xD;

CLi0UDS AND SUNSHINE.&#xD;
&#xD;
111&#xD;
&#xD;
friend B. here, in the course of previous conversa-&#xD;
tions, and indCC(l whenever we have met, almost, has&#xD;
taken the ground, and will ~.insist upon it, that this&#xD;
world of ours has always been a poor, miserable, de-&#xD;
plorable place; in its best estate, scarce fit to live&#xD;
in; that it is no better now, than ever it was; and,&#xD;
moreover, that it is never going to be any better;&#xD;
that the men of to-day. are pretty much the same&#xD;
ignorant, stupid, wicked set, as were their antedilu-&#xD;
viari brethren, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;~. Such is the constant burden.&#xD;
of his song. Now I should like to have him a little&#xD;
more explicit, and give us some of the reasons for&#xD;
his arriving at conclusions so very uncomfortable,&#xD;
and, as I think, so exceedingly unjust.&#xD;
U Coine then, brother B., unfold your views.&#xD;
B. Well, I. told A. before, that I had no faith in&#xD;
such discussions. Even where the parties are com-&#xD;
petent, and their tempers good, there ~is still so much&#xD;
uncertainty hanging over these subjects, there are&#xD;
so few substantial, well-authenticated facts to argue&#xD;
from, that they hardly repay the arguers, for the&#xD;
time and breath invested in them. And then, when&#xD;
I think how meagerly I am furnished forth for any&#xD;
su~h speculations; when I call to mind, what an in-&#xD;
competent historian, feeble geographer, miserable&#xD;
chronologist, wretched linguist, and most inefficient&#xD;
reasoner I am, with no very great surplus either, I&#xD;
fear, in the way of amiability, I am all the more dis-&#xD;
posed to hold my peace.&#xD;

0. Come, come; we can't all expect to be Mil-&#xD;
tons or Coleridges, of course; but what of that ? I&#xD;
believe, that honest, hearty expressions of opinion,&#xD;
on these and such like subjects, from almost any&#xD;
quarter, are not without their interest. So, speak&#xD;
out. Do I understand you then, to say, that the&#xD;
world has made no progress worth speaking of, in&#xD;
the way of knowledge, goodness, health, liberty, gen-&#xD;
eral development, since the great submersion ? How&#xD;
is it?&#xD;
B. I certainly am inclined very much to that&#xD;
opinion. I believe that the points of resemblance&#xD;
between ourselves and the men of antiquity, are to&#xD;
those, of difference, as ten thousand to one; and as&#xD;
you insist upon going into particulars, let us look at&#xD;
the items, a little. First then, in the matter of know-&#xD;
ledge. I believe that the ignorance of the masses,&#xD;
and the learning of the few, are now, substantially,&#xD;
what they were in the slays of Belus ; that the great&#xD;
herd, in all ages, have leen condemned to a little&#xD;
better than -animal existence, by their incapacity,&#xD;
and the necessities of their position ; and that thae&#xD;
few who have had brains, time and diligence to devote&#xD;
to study, have been learning pretty much the same&#xD;
lessons, in every century; that science and art are&#xD;
pretty much the same, now as ever ; that many of&#xD;
our fancied discoveries are mere revivals ; that while&#xD;
thinking that we are laying out new roads in -the&#xD;
realms of knowledge. we are merely removing the&#xD;
&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
rubbish, under which Time had buried the 01(1 ones ;&#xD;
and that the actual gains we may occasionally make&#xD;
in both, are counterbalanced by corresponding losses.&#xD;
I believe that if the savans of to-day, are ahead of&#xD;
those of-old, in natural science and its multiform ap-&#xD;
plication to the useful arts, they are as far behind&#xD;
them in metaphysics and the fine arts ; that if&#xD;
Aristotle and his brother philosophers, or the sages&#xD;
of the East, could be revived to-day, and confronted,&#xD;
they and their works, with the intellectual lumina-&#xD;
ries of our own time, the Edwardses and Kants and&#xD;
Cousins and Coleridges, that the latter would have&#xD;
all they could .do .to hold their own, in any discus-&#xD;
sions with these elder brothers ; that they would&#xD;
find a strength and agility and acuteness of under-&#xD;
standing, and a profundity of research, quite equal to&#xD;
their own, with far more facility and vigor of expres-&#xD;
sion ; that, in a word, they would learn quite as much&#xD;
as they would impart in any such conferences. ,Is it&#xD;
not more emphatically true, in literature and the fine&#xD;
arts ? Does not the whole world swear, to-day, by&#xD;
Homer and by Pindar ? Who but Milton is to be&#xD;
named with the one, and where is the other's peer ?&#xD;
The tragedy of Greece, what is there like it, out of&#xD;
Shakspeare ? Surely not in France or Spain, or&#xD;
even in Germany. The comedy of Greece, little as&#xD;
we have of it, and dimly as we-perceive its qualities,&#xD;
is there any thing in MIoliore, or Congreve, or Sheri-&#xD;
dan, like it ? Is there any thing short of the blessed&#xD;

&#xD;
Twelfth Night, or the delicious As You Like It, that&#xD;
could bear away the palm from it? And. even&#xD;
Shakspeare might tremble, perhaps, for his supre-&#xD;
macy, were he confronted with those hundred spark-&#xD;
ling plays of Menander, that all the wits and scholars&#xD;
of antiquity went crazy about. And what must&#xD;
those audiences have been, who insisted nightly on a&#xD;
new one, considering it a rare compliment to allow a&#xD;
second hearing, even to the Frogs? What must&#xD;
* their calibre have been, and culture, and readiness at&#xD;
repartee*? And the sculptors and architects of old,&#xD;
are not their works, to-day, the delight and despair&#xD;
of their modern brethren? And even the music of&#xD;
old, on which w~ think we have-made such wonderful&#xD;
improvements ; were we not told the other evening,&#xD;
by a learned lecturer, that on the banks of the Gan-&#xD;
ges, a thousand years before Christ, the young men&#xD;
and maidens were chanting the very melodies, that&#xD;
now take captive the ears of our beaux and belles at&#xD;
the opera? Our orchestras may be stronger and&#xD;
more varied, our harmonies more full and expressive,&#xD;
but the airs themselves, like the passions they inter-&#xD;
pret, the very same ; fashioned according to the&#xD;
same rules, just as they appealed, with the same re-&#xD;
sistless power, to the same throbbing hearts. In all&#xD;
that appertains unto the passionate, the beautiful,&#xD;
the picturesque, have we gained any thing, to say&#xD;
the least, upon our brethren of antiquity? I think&#xD;
not. I think the world is gro#ng more homely every&#xD;
&#xD;
hour. Every art and craft of life, good or bad, seems&#xD;
to me to be losing some of its poetry, continually.-&#xD;
Take the art of war. A fight was worth looking at,&#xD;
iii old times; worth transferring to canvass. An&#xD;
Achilles preparing for a m~l~e before Troy, as painted&#xD;
by homer, or an Alexander arraying himself for his&#xD;
bloody, but brilliant day's work at Arbela, as he is&#xD;
described by Plutarch, was truly a magnificent feb&#xD;
low; and an army of such fighters, when once fairly&#xD;
engaged, heart to heart, and hand to hand, with their&#xD;
gay and glittering antagonists, call it what else you&#xD;
will, ~~as surely a most superb and fascinating spec-&#xD;
tacle. how different from the mechanical, angular,&#xD;
sombre, sm6ky, unmusical transaction, called a bat-&#xD;
tle, in our times, which defies even the skill of a&#xD;
Vernet, to make it attractive! There was some&#xD;
pomp on the sea, too, formerly. The galleys of&#xD;
Greece and Carthage, with their shapely prows and&#xD;
sterns, and purple sails, and oars that moved to the&#xD;
sound of flutes, whether going in procession, on some&#xD;
pious pilgrimage to a neighboring island, or when&#xD;
involved in "all the heady currents of the fight,"&#xD;
were certainly objects that an artist might look at&#xD;
with satisfaction, might take pleasure in perpetuat-&#xD;
ing in fresco or mosaic; but what is there poetical&#xD;
in our ships of war, or in, the representations of&#xD;
modern naval fights? Who ever dreams of explor-&#xD;

or grog-inspired old salt? The splendid turn-outs&#xD;
of Venice, too, her gay gondolas, her sumptuous&#xD;
Bucentaur, where are they now? Sleeping the sleep&#xD;
of death, with the poor fallen city they adorned.&#xD;
The stately ships that loom ~up so, in the pictures&#xD;
of Claude and Yander Velde, with their lofty, gild-&#xD;

and images of saints, how are they banished from&#xD;
the deep! A group~ of such tall argosies, dressed&#xD;
out in their gay robes, and lit up by the setting sun,&#xD;
might indeed, have kindled the imagination of poet&#xD;
or of painter. But their day is over, and a far dif-&#xD;
ferent generation has succeeded them; a generation&#xD;
of saucy, sharp-set, officious clippers; far more nim-&#xD;

the globe four times to th~ii' predecessors' once; but&#xD;
no more to be compared with them on the score of&#xD;

driven from the ocean, yes, everything that sails&#xD;
with wings, and as if every sea, and bay, and river&#xD;
of earth were to be monopolized by little, black,&#xD;
noisy, ugly steam-tugs, and huge; unsightly propel-&#xD;
lers. And the costume of men, as well as ships, is&#xD;
it not taking the same direction; got up exclusively&#xD;
for purposes of utility and rapid motion, and in defi-&#xD;
ance of all the laws of beauty? Take even the&#xD;

his Thessalian steeds, was he not far ahead of any&#xD;
thing the Champs Elys6es or Hyde Park ever wit-&#xD;
nessed, in the way of costume and appointments?&#xD;
The epicures of old, were they not far more learned&#xD;
than their modern brethen? Is there any Fish-&#xD;
Sauce extant, which is to be compared with that&#xD;
which Ileliogabalus used to put upon his turbot?&#xD;
Could Soyer himself have devilled a crab with&#xD;
Apicius? Is there a cook on earth this hour, either&#xD;
snoring in his night-cap, or issuing his edicts in the&#xD;
kitchen, that could begin to get up a supper with&#xD;
the chef of Lucullus'? Is there any such wiiie in&#xD;
any chateau of Metternich, or cellar of Dijon, Ii will&#xD;
not say as Priam or Xerxes used to go to bed on,&#xD;
but as was stored away in the vaults o~ Tiberius or&#xD;

thing more, after all, than a third rate Sa~llust or&#xD;
Ma~cenas? Are there any entertainments coming&#xD;
off, this day, in any quarter of the globe, at all com-&#xD;
parable, either in the intellectual or physical depart-&#xD;
departments, to the Olympic Games? I don't&#xD;
believe it; no such poetry, no such jumping. Where&#xD;

rather a small figure at Corinth, and the double som-&#xD;
erset of Hiram Franklin have been coldly received.&#xD;
Ought we not to remember these things in the midst&#xD;
of our self-laudations? Because we can analyze&#xD;
substances more minutely, and have found out a few&#xD;
more secrets in electricity, and can calculate dis-&#xD;
tances and eclipses with more certainty, anti can&#xD;
plough the waters and rattle over the earth faster&#xD;
than our antique brethren could, and manufacture&#xD;
more paper money, anchcirculate more cheap pen-&#xD;
odicals, we should not forget that they could raise&#xD;
heavier ~weights, rear loftier piles, make better stat-&#xD;
ues, and if they could not illuminate their buildings&#xD;
with the same rapidity, knew far better how to ven-&#xD;
tilate them and to clear them of crowds. Think of&#xD;
the Colosseum, that would hold an audience of a&#xD;
hundred and twenty thousand, and yet~ could be&#xD;
emptied in ten minutes, while we enlightened Go-&#xD;
'~ thamites nightly put our persons in peril, at (what&#xD;
we call) ijionster concerts,' and lectures at Metropo-&#xD;
litan ll~dl. Besides, as I said before, how many of&#xD;
our fancied novelties are mere revivals: we ~ow&#xD;
know, that the youngsters of Greece used to rub&#xD;
their little noses and fingers against window-panes,&#xD;
and that the fine women of Rome used to take their&#xD;
opera glasses to the theatres; that balloon excur-&#xD;
sions were common things in the days of Sanconi-&#xD;
ath, and spiritual rapping no novelty in the time of&#xD;
Zoroaster. They, no doubt, had their Mesmerism&#xD;
&#xD;
too, and their Socialism, and their miracle-working&#xD;
pills and ointments, their quack remedies of all&#xD;
sorts, for all the physical, moral, and social ills of&#xD;
life. And why should not these same Greeks and&#xD;
IRornans have had their contrivances for multiplying&#xD;
manuscripts, and their water, or even steam-propelled&#xD;
machinery, for grinding their corn, and for making&#xD;
their purple and fine linen, and for facilitating the&#xD;
operations of their mints' and foundries? I can't&#xD;
believe that the men who could put a Parthenon in&#xD;
marble, who could manufacture such superb plate&#xD;
and jewelry, who could furnish so daintily a palace&#xD;
of the C~sars, were so ignorant of these auxiliary&#xD;
forces in nature, and of the art of using them, as we&#xD;
suppose. It seems more reasonable to believe, that&#xD;
most of these inventions of ours, as we call them,&#xD;
are mere reappearance of what the world has seen&#xD;
already; that they had their day, and gradually fell&#xD;
into desuetude and decay, from ~he diversion of hu-&#xD;
man thoughts and wits into other channels; that&#xD;
the same causes will kill them again, and again re-&#xD;
vive them, and that they will continue to play this&#xD;
game of hide-and-seek, for aught we know, through&#xD;
all eternity. The more I think of these things, the&#xD;
more disposed am I to believe that the capacities anti&#xD;
acquisitions of men have been substantially the&#xD;
same from the beginning; that there is the same&#xD;
ignorance of the learned, afid learning of the igno-&#xD;

about as little, concerning the real causes of dis-&#xD;

ship between. soul and body, as the medical advisers&#xD;
of her Britannic Majesty do ; and that then as now,&#xD;
the wisest and best in the profession, ~xonld have&#xD;
been the very first to avow their ignorance. In a&#xD;
word, I believe what Solomon preached, and Shaks-&#xD;
peare sang, and our own hearts re-echo, and Pompeii&#xD;
has proved, and Nineveh is hourly proving; that&#xD;
there is no new thing under the sun. I shouldn't be&#xD;
surprised, at any moment, to hear of some Rip Van&#xD;
Winkle of a city, suddenly roused from its sleep of a&#xD;
thousand generations or so, in some silent, desolate&#xD;
corner of the Old World, perhaps on the banks of the&#xD;
Euphrates itself, with its buried locomotives, and&#xD;
steam-tugs, and gas-pipCS, and telegraphic wires, and&#xD;
all the appliances that we so coolly a1)propriate7 as&#xD;
the exclusive property, of our own century. May not&#xD;
*the Creator condescend, some fine morning, to show&#xD;
it to the world, through the medium of some silly,&#xD;
-wandering shepherd, for the very purpose of mortify-&#xD;
ing and humbling this most conceited and self-glori-&#xD;
fyin g generation? But enough on this head. You&#xD;
spoke of health, too. Is the world any healthier now&#xD;
than it used to be? Are there more hearty, ruddy&#xD;
specimens of humanity, mc~ving about the globe, this&#xD;
morning, than there were in the time of Nebuchad-&#xD;
&#xD;
nezzar? I have no idea of it, myself. I believe,&#xD;
moreover, that, could we have taken a walk through&#xD;
the streets of Athens in the days of ,~' ericles, or of&#xD;
Rome in those of Augustus, and imme~ijately after~&#xD;
have had a peep at our own Broadway, as we see it&#xD;
to-day, we should have found a frightful balance&#xD;
against us, in the way of bright eyes, and good looks,&#xD;
and general muscular developments. There can be&#xD;
little doubt where the sculptor would have gone for&#xD;
his models; little doubt in which of the cities the&#xD;
largest share of round shoulders and spindle-shanks&#xD;
would have been found, or nine-tenths of the cough-.&#xD;
ing and sneezing and general complaining would&#xD;
rave been heard; or in which metropolis a sudden&#xD;
call for an outlay of physical force would have been&#xD;
least satisfactorily answered; or in ease of a colli-&#xD;
sion between the ancient and modern promenaders,&#xD;
where the victory would have been. Could we have&#xD;
had ime to get at our fire-arms, I grant you we&#xD;
mig~7t have carried the day; but, with nature's own&#xD;
weapons, can there be any doubt that we of the 19th&#xD;
would have been soundly thrashed? But seriously,&#xD;
I believe that the world is a sad loser in this regard&#xD;
.-that there is far less of high health and animal&#xD;
spirits on earth than ever before; less of God's&#xD;
fresh air tasted; less out-door work or. play; less&#xD;
familiarity with the beautiful sounds and sights of&#xD;
nature. There are far more prisoners than ever,&#xD;
toiling in mines, and galleys, and factories; more&#xD;

people than ever, killing themselves in crowded cit~&#xD;
ics, martyrs to fashion, and care, and business&#xD;
more poor wretches locked up in narrow, noisome&#xD;
lanes, who scarce ever see a star in heaven, who&#xD;
only know of a sunrise or sunset by hearsay; poor&#xD;
caged birds, who see no more of the blessed fields&#xD;

just fit to be swept away by the first disease that&#xD;
may be prowling round for victims, the first pesti-&#xD;
lence that may ride the tainted air. Is it not so?&#xD;
Am I wrong, when I say that there were never more&#xD;
miserable, unpromising babies brought into the&#xD;

cruel, fatal disorders, more little contemptible aib&#xD;

selves of their fair share of years? IF thinl~ not.&#xD;
But I will not dwell any longer on this point. Let&#xD;
us look a moment at the item of Freedom, of which&#xD;
you next spoke. Is there any more of the real,&#xD;
'genuine article in the world now than ever? There&#xD;
are great apparent gains, certainly, in some quar-&#xD;
ters;' in our own and the mother country, and other&#xD;
parts of Irthern Europe, and in some few scattered&#xD;
colonies; but are there not quite as many palpable&#xD;
losses in Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Asia Minor,&#xD;
Syria, Palestine? Are they not worse off than&#xD;
ever in this and all other desirable things? What&#xD;
&#xD;
a 5l)ectaCle does the Holy Land present, this very&#xD;
hour! Look at Bethlehem itself; the spot of all&#xD;
others, one would~ suppose, that guardian angels&#xD;
would hover over, to keep the peace and protect the&#xD;
pious traveller; why, it is as much as a poor pil-&#xD;
grim's life is worth, to visit the shrine of his Mas-&#xD;
ter: in no part, even of Judea, are robberies and&#xD;
murders so plentiful. And so throughout all these&#xD;
regions; the only freedom to be found there is that&#xD;
of prowling Arabs; the freedom of ruffians and cut-&#xD;
throats ! Look all through the continents of Asia&#xD;
and Africa, and show me any thing like a Runny-&#xD;
mede or a Bunker's lull, in either; any spot amidst&#xD;
all those millions of acres, and myriads of souls,&#xD;
where a solitary battle has ever been fought for hu-&#xD;
man rights. Not one; tyranny and ignorance have&#xD;
pervaded them from the beginning.; the same savage&#xD;
wars and superstitions deface Africa, the same apa-&#xD;
thy and stupidity preside over all the trades and&#xD;
arts of Asia to-day, as did thousands of years ago.&#xD;
The freedom of the South American Republics, too;&#xD;
what a bitter mockery is it! The privilege of the&#xD;
strongest arm and sharpest sword, to mow down all&#xD;
opposition, and amuse and plunder its subjects, till&#xD;
in turn driven out by superior power. How much&#xD;
better is it, too, in Austria and Russia? France,&#xD;
too, after all her demonstrations ~and fine words, her&#xD;
fetes and fireworks, how quietly at last has she suc-&#xD;
cumbed to a miserable usurper; about whom there&#xD;

is nothing lustrous or fascinating; whose whole life&#xD;
has been a lie, a mere mass of humbug and self-&#xD;
indulgence! Freedom, indeed! Even in our own&#xD;
comparatively favored land, how much downright,&#xD;
bona fide liberty is there'? I grant you, that our&#xD;
rights are more explicitly defined than elsewhere, in&#xD;
constitutions, and statute-books, more discussed by&#xD;
the press and the pulpit, more harangued about by&#xD;
orators at all sorts of gatherings ; but what do they&#xD;
all amount to, when fairly analyzed? Leaving the&#xD;
embellishments of rhetoric, and the exaggerations&#xD;
of self-love out of the question, and coming down to&#xD;
sober, naked facts, IL ask how much real freedom&#xD;
does a citizen, and especially one of small income,&#xD;
enjoy in this same metropolis of ours? How far&#xD;
may he express, unharmed, his honest opinions'?&#xD;
In Religion, for instance, suppose I were to say to-&#xD;

not believe in the divine origin of Christianity;&#xD;

morning, I grant you, nor imprisoned, nor even&#xD;
lined, nor excluded from The ordinary places of re~&#xD;
sort. But just a~ certainly, I should be exposed to&#xD;
all sorts of little annoyances and persecutions; doors&#xD;
now open, would be closed against me; daughters&#xD;
would be denied me in marriage; custoxner5 would&#xD;

time of it in bank; my creditors would be more im-&#xD;
portunate than ever; my very servants would be&#xD;
less attentive and respectful. I should pay, in ten&#xD;
thousand small ways, for the luxury of giving breath&#xD;
to an opinion, which was unpalatable to the majority.&#xD;
My prospects in life would be materially injured by&#xD;
any such honest, but injudicious statement ; it mat~&#xD;
ters not, though my skepticism may be the result of&#xD;
the reading and reflection of years, while the so-called&#xD;
faith, of three-fifths of my persecutors, may be mere&#xD;
hypocritical assumption, or the fruit of servile fear&#xD;
and ignorance; I must none the less pay the pen-&#xD;
alty. Let me express any unwelcome opinion to any&#xD;
party in power, 1 care not in what department of&#xD;
thought or branch of trade, and am I not quite as&#xD;
likely to pay roundly for it, in this as in any other&#xD;
era? I may not have to gulp my poison down on the&#xD;
spot, like Socrates, but I may confidently rely on the&#xD;
slow poison of misrepresentation and abuse; I may&#xD;
not be shot down wiLh that promptness and mystery&#xD;
with which plain-spoken men are sometimes disposed&#xD;
of; in the court-yards of imperial palaces, but I, in all&#xD;
probability, will be pelted, even to the edge of my&#xD;
grave, with the missiles of hired scribblers and slan-&#xD;
derers. And so the poor wife may not have her&#xD;
throat cut by her husband, with the same impunity&#xD;
now, as of old; but he may torment the very soul&#xD;
out of her, by his ceaseless neglect or cruelty, just&#xD;
as thoroughly and effectually as in the days of Nero.&#xD;

Again, how much freedom of motion have I, in this&#xD;
thriving g city of ours ? How far is it modified and&#xD;
restrained, in the day-time, by the- lawlessness of&#xD;
omnibus-drivers, and the incursions of cattle-droves,&#xD;
and in the night, by the aggressions of rowdies and&#xD;

Broadway, and one or two other thoroughfares, after&#xD;
nine P. M., without the guaranty of Bowie-knife or&#xD;
revolver ? Honest answers to these questions, how&#xD;
mortifying, how- disgraceful are they, to us and to too&#xD;
many of, our sister-cities ! Freedom of election, too,&#xD;
that booh -of the race, that- showiest flower in the,&#xD;
bouquets of our orators, what becomes of nine-tenths&#xD;
of it, when fairly sifted ? What proportion of the&#xD;
votes polled in our town, last November, were the&#xD;
embodiments of intelligent, unbiassed, honest convic-&#xD;
tion? I speak not of the sae~rifices made, the degra-.&#xD;
ding exactions submitted .to, by the candidates for .&#xD;
office, in order to get their names formally before the&#xD;
pople;- but the sovereigns themselves, and above all,&#xD;
te colored portion of those sovereigns, how much free-&#xD;
dom of choice or action, did they have in the prem-&#xD;
ises ? Why, even the white Whig voter has found&#xD;
it a sufficiently perilous undertaking, in some of he&#xD;
wards of our city, to indicate, in the usual way,is&#xD;
plitia p references; but wo betide the colored tax-&#xD;
payerawho, in some unguarded moment, should un-&#xD;

must this worthy old soul be frightened away from&#xD;
the polls ; he is not even allowed to show that plea-&#xD;
-sant face of his, nor his excellent wife, inside of any&#xD;
omnibus or rail-car, in this enlightened town. I am&#xD;
no abolitionist, my friend. I have no sympathy with&#xD;

times, to see an old man turned out of a car, in a&#xD;
cold, rainy night, because of his black skin, a~t the&#xD;
bidding of a set of creatures, infinitely below him in&#xD;
all the substantial qualities of humanity. These are&#xD;
disgraceful, damning facts, and are of far more signi-&#xD;
ficance, to every thoughtful mind, than a frigate-load&#xD;
of Fourth of July odes or orations. Need I say, how&#xD;
many other things there are, to compromise my free-&#xD;
dom ? The tribute to be paid to fashion, if one would&#xD;
avoid unpleasant, notoriety ; the tyranny of tailors,&#xD;
who one month incarcerate you in horribly tight gar-&#xD;
ments, and the next, set you adrift in a perfect fog of&#xD;
clothing ; the innumerable exactions of etiquette ;&#xD;
the ceaseless invasion of bores, duns, and quacks of&#xD;
all sorts ; the visitations of tax-gatherers, both pro-&#xD;
fessional and amateur ; the small slavery to one's&#xD;
own whims and caprices. and bodily needs and in-&#xD;

the cruel fetters that our appetites and passions are&#xD;

boasted freedom of ours, when we think of these&#xD;
things? I say again, I see about as little as ever of&#xD;
it in the world. I see the same predominance of'.&#xD;
tyranny as ever; the same disposition to over-ride&#xD;
and crush opposition, in all ranks and classes; the&#xD;
same unwillingness of the intellectual man to surren -&#xD;
der his sway over the minds of his brethren, and of&#xD;
the belle to bear a rival near her throne, and of the&#xD;
prima donna .to divide plaudits and bouquets with&#xD;
the new-corner, and of the wit-but why illustrate&#xD;
further-of every wilder of power, to share it with&#xD;
his fellows. Tyranny, where is it not'? At hearth&#xD;
and at altar, at social and political gatherings; the,&#xD;
tyranny of the majority, as we feel it, in our own&#xD;
land, to day, is it not about as cruel and unwise as&#xD;
any thing we read of; in Grecian or Roman history?&#xD;
A majority that wilfully turns its back upon the&#xD;
most politic measures, the most imperative duties of&#xD;
the Republic; that excludes its oldest and most&#xD;
honored sons from its high places; that rushes reck-&#xD;
lessly on, in the career of annexation and aggression;&#xD;
that would plunge us in a bloody war, to-morrow, for&#xD;
the sake of a few paltry acres, while it utterly neg-&#xD;
lects the legitimate development of its resources, and&#xD;
protection of its industry. And then, that most&#xD;
grinding4 crushing tyranny of all, the tyranny of&#xD;
mammon; the great autocrat, who has ruled the&#xD;
world from the beginning: when was the money-&#xD;
power ever more firmly established than now? In&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
what pai$ of its dominions, is it more omnipotent,&#xD;
than in this same boasting ~netropolis of ours ?-&#xD;
What iwill it not buy here, to-day, that should not&#xD;
be bought? What votes, and signatures, and puffs,&#xD;
and unlawful merchandise of all sorts, can it not&#xD;
freely command, for itself; and for its enemies, what&#xD;
pens of hireling scribblers, and pencils of caricatur-&#xD;
ists, and, if' need be, bludgeons of ruffians? We&#xD;
talk, with horror, of the degrading rites and obscene&#xD;
ceremonies of the Bacchanalia and Eleusinian Mys-&#xD;
teries of old, but were they, after all, much worse&#xD;
than the abject prostrations and cruel sacrifices that&#xD;
belong to this wide-spread Dollar-worship of our own&#xD;
times? I can't see much difference in them, I con-&#xD;
fess. The -more I think of all these things, the more&#xD;
unsubstantial and illusory Joes this vaunted freedom&#xD;
of ours~appear. Toleration is just as scarce an arti-&#xD;
cle as ever. If tyranny deal less' racks and faggots&#xD;
than she did, she has far more ~s ~nall ways of punish-&#xD;
ing her , victims, than ever she had. An opinion,&#xD;
however honest, if unpalatable to her, is about as&#xD;
costly a luxury, and truth-telling generally as unpro-&#xD;
fitable and perilous a business, now, as it was under&#xD;
the C~sars; nay, the whole pilgrimage of life is just-&#xD;
as hill of clogs, and restrictions and annoyances and&#xD;
perils, to-day, as when the first generation of sinners&#xD;
performed it. Brother A., of course, has no faith in,~&#xD;
or sympathy with such a doctrine, and I will not&#xD;

its Creator, in a moral point of view, than in olden&#xD;
time? I don't believe it. I don't believe that the&#xD;
sum total of the thoughts, words, and deeds, that will&#xD;
have transpired in this metropolis, between sunrise&#xD;
and sunset of this pleasant day of December, in the&#xD;
yeal of grace, '1852, will any better bear divine in-&#xD;
spection, than a similar aggregate would have done,&#xD;
in Tyre, or Babylon, or Rome, in the days of their&#xD;
plenty and prosperity; and if there be, indeed, as we&#xD;
are told, a record kept above, of all these things, and&#xD;
we could turn to the celestial book~, and make the&#xD;
comparison for ourselves, we should find the points&#xD;
of difference, in this regard, as nothing, alongside of&#xD;
the multitudinous, the hideous points of resemblance.&#xD;
There wduld be less open bestiality and throat-cut~&#xD;
ting, in the modern city, I grant you;, less blood of&#xD;
men shed in theatres, and of beasts in places of wor-&#xD;
ship; less downright brutal ignorance in the lower&#xD;
walks of life; but not one whit less of secret vices&#xD;
and villanies, of wide-spread selfishness and sensu-&#xD;
ality; the same domesticc bickering, the same cease-&#xD;
less squabbles about nothing, the same multiform&#xD;
frauds in trade, and quackeries of all sorts; the same&#xD;
corruption in high places, and small stealing in low&#xD;
ones;&#xD;
&#xD;
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,&#xD;
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,&#xD;
The insolence of office, and the spurns&#xD;
That patient merit of the unworthy takes;&#xD;
all, all the same; t14 same sad, guilty story that&#xD;
human life has been, from the beginning. Is it not&#xD;
so? Look again at the two multitudes, as they&#xD;
sweep by us; the one, as revived by the magic wand&#xD;
of thc~ poet, the other as we see it with our own&#xD;
bodily eyes, this day. Where is the difference, save&#xD;
in the hue and fashion of their garments? I can't&#xD;
see it. There are in both, the same passion-stained&#xD;
faces, the same martyrs to care and business and&#xD;
avarice and lust and gout and glory; in both, the'&#xD;
same tender babes, and frolicking children; the same&#xD;
tottering age; the same few scattered philosophers,&#xD;
the same hand~1 of men and women, going about on&#xD;
errands 6f love; in both, the same overwhelming&#xD;
majority of fops and clowns and pickpockets and&#xD;
sleek hypocrites and smooth-tongued scoundrels and&#xD;
painted harlots; the same frightful preponderance&#xD;
of oaths and falsehoods and filthy jests, over words&#xD;
of gentleness and prayer and thanksgiving. Gloomy'&#xD;
and repulsive as the picture may be, in either case,&#xD;
yet is it not the true one? Are we not enacting the&#xD;
same old drama, in New-York, to-day, with some&#xD;
slight changes in costume and scenery, that the men&#xD;
of Babylon were, in the days of Semiramis? II can't&#xD;

vor of us moderns, in all those particulars which&#xD;
brother B. has glanced at ; and with your leave, I&#xD;
will follow briefly in his track. First, then, as to&#xD;
knowledge. I say there is far more knowledge to:&#xD;
day in the world, in. every department of science and&#xD;
art, than- ever there was ; far more acquaintance&#xD;
both with the outside and the inside of the earth,&#xD;
and with the properties of its contents, animate and&#xD;
inanimate ; farA more, with the attributes of the&#xD;
other heavenly bodies, and with the laws that govern&#xD;
them; and above all, there is a thousand told great-&#xD;
er power of imparting, and multiplying, and circulat-&#xD;
ing our knowledge all over the globe, and of pre-&#xD;
serving it safe, forever, from the power of accident&#xD;
and the clutches of time. In this last respect, how&#xD;
marked our superiority ! We may defy all the&#xD;

torches of all, the Omars. If every imperial and&#xD;
roya~library of Europe were destroyed this day,&#xD;
nay, if the Old World itself were to disappear be-&#xD;
neath the waves, what is there really precious and&#xD;
substantial, either in Art or Letters, that we men&#xD;
of America would not -still have, or could 'not, with&#xD;
these materials and resources, these keen wits *and&#xD;
ironwills of ours, in good season, reproduce ? Not&#xD;
a-thing. All that is valuable in science and the&#xD;
literature of every clime, we should of course have,&#xD;
safe and sound already ; and as, for the rest, even&#xD;
the dearest and most famous master-pieces oi' Paint-&#xD;
ing, Sculpture, and Architecture,' is there one of&#xD;
them, that American 'genius could not in time re-&#xD;
place ? No, not one, from the Cathedral of Cologne&#xD;
down to the daintiest knick-knack of Paris. Thanks&#xD;
to modern skill, no precious thing of earth need ever&#xD;
again perish. No triumph of genius, no noteworthy&#xD;
deed of art or arms, no act of piety or patriotism,&#xD;
need ever pass from memory, but may live forever,&#xD;
and be scattered freely abroad, for the delight and&#xD;
instruction of the children of me'n. Think of these&#xD;
marvellous powers of multiplication and circulation&#xD;
that we have, and then of the slow processes of an-'&#xD;
tiquity : with what ado have a few stray fragments&#xD;
of their choicest poets, orators, and historians, b/n&#xD;
rescued from the jaws of oblivion. But I maintain&#xD;
that we have equally the advantage over our breth-&#xD;

the tour of a menagerie, or of a museum, or turned&#xD;
over the pages of an encyclopaedia, or 'even cast a&#xD;

of maintaining it for a moment I deny it in~ toto-.&#xD;
I say again, there is no branch of science, no walk&#xD;
of Art, from highest to lowest, wherein we are infe-&#xD;
rior to the ancients, while in ninety-nine hundredths&#xD;
almost, we are immeasurably their superiors. I&#xD;
deny their superiority in Metaphysics or the Fine&#xD;
Arts. I do not believe there were any more pro-&#xD;
found or subtle reasoners, in the days of Aristotle,&#xD;
than Fearne, or Cousin, or Edwards, or Calhoun ;&#xD;
nor that there were any grander or more beautiful&#xD;
thoughts embodied in stone, either in statues or in&#xD;
buildings, in the age of Pericles, than our own land&#xD;
can show to-day. Our sculptors are already the&#xD;
worthy brothers of Phidias and Praxiteles, and as&#xD;
to Architecture, I would ask what more princely&#xD;
structure did Athens ever contain, than the Girard&#xD;
College ; what building of its kind to be named in&#xD;
the same age -with the Philadelphia Penitentiary,&#xD;
that masterpiece of skill and invention, which every&#xD;
capital of Europe, almost, has imitated ? And so in&#xD;
music. If the specimens of Grecian music that&#xD;
liave recently been exhibited to us, truly represent&#xD;
the art, it is perfectly monstrous to -compare it with&#xD;

the strains 'of Haydn, and Mozart, and Rossini. .If&#xD;
such were the melodies wherewith the Athenian&#xD;
maidens were serenaded, or the Athenian bride-&#xD;
grooms summoned to marriage, I can only say I&#xD;
pity then. They certainly sounded 'to me far more&#xD;
like that eccentric and lugubi-ious piece of vocaliza-&#xD;
tion, the morning song that poor old Red Jacket&#xD;
used to mumble over his cups, than like any thing in&#xD;
the Messiah, or the Sonnambula. And in painting.&#xD;
I cannot believe that the best specimens of the art&#xD;
ever produced in Rome or Athens, were to be com-&#xD;
pared with the apostolic heads of Rubens, or the an-&#xD;
gelic faces of Raffaelle, and Correggio, and Over-&#xD;
beck. I believe Christian art, in this department,&#xD;
to be as far superior to pagan, as are the themes within&#xD;
which it deals. Take Raffaelle himself, and who&#xD;
would compare, for a moment, his Galatea, or his&#xD;
Councils or Banquets of the Gods, with his Holy&#xD;
Families or Transfiguration ? -or the Hours in Gui-&#xD;
do's Aurora, lovely as they are, with his Madonnas&#xD;
and Saints? .By. the same rule, how much more&#xD;
grand and suggestive, how much more eloquent in&#xD;
its appeals, both to our imagination and our affec-&#xD;
tions, is a modern Cathedral, such as the Duomo of&#xD;
.Milan, for instance, with its pictured windows,&#xD;
its countless spires and angels, than any of the cold,&#xD;
cheerless temples of antiquity, for all their rich&#xD;
facades and harmonious proportions ! Nay, so per-&#xD;

that I would not, on a venture, exchange the Mercy's&#xD;
Dream of Huntington for all that was ever done, in&#xD;
oil or fresco, by the greatest masters of the heathen&#xD;
world. And in poetry; who will say that we have&#xD;
fallen behind our brethren of old in this depart-&#xD;
ment? Or rather, who will not say, that Shak-&#xD;
speare and Milton alone are worth all the classic&#xD;
-bards put together? It seems to me sheer profi~nity&#xD;
to compare the Iliad or IEneid with the Paradise&#xD;
Lost, whether we consider the theme itself, the won-&#xD;
drous stores of learning with which it is illustrated,&#xD;
or the daring flights of imagination with which it is&#xD;
filled. And as to tragedy; would not the loss of&#xD;
King Lear alone, be a far greater one to the world&#xD;
than that of all the tragedies of old that have come&#xD;
dQwn to us? And I believe the same would be&#xD;
found1 true in comedy. Sparkling as Menander's&#xD;
plays must have- been, and bright the wits that list-&#xD;
ened to- them, I yet doubt whether they had any such&#xD;
brilliant passages-at-arms in them as those between&#xD;
Benedict and Beatrice, Orlando and Rosalind. No,&#xD;
no; there has been but one Mercutio, one Hamlet,&#xD;
one Imogen, since the great drama of life itself be-&#xD;
gan. But not to dwell any longer upon the fine arts,&#xD;
let me venture to cast a hasty glance over the broad&#xD;
domain of the useful. And here, si~rAy the supe-&#xD;
riority of as moderns is . most apparent, and over-&#xD;
whelming. In every branch of natural science, in&#xD;
our investigations of the laws of light and heat and&#xD;
&#xD;
motion and attraction, in our analysis and classifica-&#xD;
tion of all the objects about us~ animate and inani-&#xD;
mate, can there be any doubt about our wonderful&#xD;
progress in all these things? Why, England alone&#xD;
can produce four names, within a century back, that&#xD;
represent, I believe, fourfold more knowledge of all&#xD;
the secrets of nature, than would those of all the&#xD;
philosophers of Egypt, and Greece, and India com-&#xD;
bined. Could we bring together, to-day, all the wise&#xD;
men of the East, from the flood down, on the one&#xD;
hand, and the four intellects of Newton, Davy, Her-&#xD;
schel, and Brewster on the other, and have their re-&#xD;
spective acquisitions tested, if you will, by a select&#xD;
committee of seraphim, who can doubt to whom the&#xD;
prizes of victory would be awarded? And in the&#xD;
application of this knowledge to the business of life,&#xD;
is there not a corresponding progress? What sort&#xD;
of a figure would Archimedes cut to-day, as engi-&#xD;
neer and mechanician, alongside of the architect of&#xD;
the Crystal Palace? And which of his country-&#xD;
men would you select as the worthy counterparts of&#xD;
Watt, and Fulton, and Daguerre, and Morse, and&#xD;
Ericssorr? his very easy to say that the ingen-&#xD;
ious contrivances of these and kindred benefactors&#xD;
of their race, for the multiplication of objects and&#xD;
images, for the transmission of men, an(l things, and&#xD;
thoughts over the globe, and for saving, in ten thou-&#xD;
sand ways, the labor of their brethren, are all mere&#xD;
reappearance of lost arts; but what thoughtful&#xD;

man can believe it for a moment? I have no more&#xD;
idea, in yself, that steam, and caloric, and lightning&#xD;
were ever before pressed into the service of man, as&#xD;
we now behold them, than I have that the mantifac&#xD;
turers of Babylon turned out mord beautiful and&#xD;
truthful time-pieces, in the days of Semiramisthan&#xD;
do those of Geneva to-day; or that there were Power-&#xD;
Loom Carpet Factories in Jericho, in the days of&#xD;
Joshua, supplying Judea with more superb fabrics&#xD;
than those of our own Manchester and Lowell.&#xD;
Lowell itself; where was its counterpart among all&#xD;
the cities of antiquity? What land did it enliven&#xD;
and benefit? What stream fed its industry? The&#xD;
Indus, or the Ganges, or the Tiber? Ab, no; these&#xD;
names are associated with deeds of blood and con-&#xD;
quest only ; not of peaceful, honorable labor. Sup-&#xD;
pose Confucius himself were alive to-day, and on his&#xD;
travels; is there a sight on earth that would so im-&#xD;
press and delight him as this same Yankee-notion&#xD;
of a city? How would he contrast its exquisite ma-&#xD;
chinery, its comfortable dwellings, its various and&#xD;
intelligent industry, its comely, bright- eyed, well-&#xD;
clad laborers, with the stupid, squalid, wretched&#xD;
creatures, that did the work of the world in his time!&#xD;
Tell me not, that all this is a mere repetition of the&#xD;
past. Such a spot could not have perished from&#xD;
the face of the earth, without mark or record. No,&#xD;
no: as I said before, nothing short of the destruc-&#xD;
tion of the planet itself, could deprive us of these&#xD;

They defy all that time and chance can bring against&#xD;
them. Once ours, we will keep them, and their&#xD;
fruits, safe and sound till doomsday. had they ex-&#xD;
isted before, why, we should only have been so much&#xD;
the farther on the road to our destined perfection,&#xD;
than we are; should have had so much the more&#xD;
material to study and to work from, so many the&#xD;
fewer problems for the philosopher and the philan-&#xD;
thropist to work oat. Ah no, these things are not&#xD;
mere revivals, but the genuine growth of our own&#xD;
tirvies; the legitimate result of the enlarged experi-&#xD;
ence and matured thought of the world; the natu-&#xD;
ral forerunners of still greater improvements and&#xD;
blessings to come. And so in all that belongs to&#xD;
commerce, navigation, agriculture, manufactures;&#xD;
to state is, it seems to me, sufficiently to argue the&#xD;
question of superiority, as bet~veen us and the an-&#xD;
cients. Take the merchant of Tyre, or of Babylon,&#xD;
in its prosperous days, and the merchant of New&#xD;
York; could we follow them from their respective&#xD;
homes to their counting houses, and through the&#xD;
business of the day, who can doubt that in every&#xD;
item connected with that business, from the ink he&#xD;
writes with, up to the lawyer he consults, the man&#xD;
of New York would be found to have the advantage2&#xD;
I have no idea, for one, that the Tyrian or Babylo-&#xD;

treatises, such improvements of all sorts, could not&#xD;
have existed in those days; the world was not ripe&#xD;
for them. Theymare the genuine results of the en-&#xD;
larged commerce and knowledge of the race, and we&#xD;
ought so to consider them, and be grateful for them,&#xD;
instead of grumbling as we do, and perversely chant-&#xD;
ing the praises of the past. The commerce of anti-&#xD;
quity, indeed! I should as soon think of comparing&#xD;
it with that of our own times, as, of comparing the&#xD;
eomi-piratical cruise of Jason and his companions in&#xD;
search of the golden fleece with our own Australian&#xD;
and Californian expeditions. The old Persian kings,&#xD;
we are told, -used to keep the bottled waters of the&#xD;

Such a fact might have had its significance, in those&#xD;
days ; but how small and childish a thing does it&#xD;
seem to us, whose Newark cider is drank at the base&#xD;
of Ararat, and who, in one little month, can circulate&#xD;
all over the globe the healthful waters of Saratoga&#xD;
or of Sharon ! The products of ancient commerce,&#xD;
what were they, compared with ours?&amp;amp; Not to speak&#xD;
of cotton and sugar, I verily believe that there is&#xD;
more business done to-day, in India Rubber alone,&#xD;
with its myriad shapes and uses, than all the com-&#xD;
mercial transactions of Greece would have amounted&#xD;
to, put together. .The navigation of antiquity, too !&#xD;
The timid, creeping navigation of the shipmasters of&#xD;
Tyre and Carthage, how monstrous to speak of it in&#xD;
the same breath with our world-searching merchant-&#xD;
men and whalers ! But I may not stop to multiply&#xD;
illustrations. Brother B., in the course of his re-&#xD;
marks, then went on to assert and to mourn over the&#xD;
departure of the beautiful and the picturesque from&#xD;
earth. . He said the planet and every thing on it,&#xD;
were growing homelier every hour, and that every&#xD;
calling of life was fast losing all its poetical surround-&#xD;
ings. More especially was this the case, he said, in&#xD;
the art of war ; a battle, now-a-days, was -a very&#xD;
ugly, dingy affair, compared with a similar exhibition&#xD;
in the time of Coriolanus. .Well, it may be true, to&#xD;
a certain extent. The description in Plutarch, to&#xD;
which he referred, of Alexander arming himself, in&#xD;
true Homeric style, for conquest, is indeed most&#xD;

graphic and spirited ; and no doubt it would have&#xD;
given a Salvator Rosa more pleasure to have painted&#xD;
a fight, in which such combatants figured, than to.&#xD;
have transferred those of Bunker's Hill, or York-&#xD;
town, to canvass. But in all other points of view, IJ&#xD;
should say, our modern warfare was far the more&#xD;
interesting of the two. Take the battle of Arbela,&#xD;
as one of the most memorable specimens of antique&#xD;
fighting, and look at it, alongside of. Waterloo.--&#xD;
Think of the scale on which things were done, the&#xD;
character of' the agencies employed, the amount of&#xD;
science and art expended in getting up the respective&#xD;
exhibitions, and who can hesitate for a moment in&#xD;
deciding as to which was the grander and more terri-&#xD;
ble display of strength and of genius ? Why, the&#xD;
former sinks into a mere dog-fight, in comparison.--&#xD;
In the same way, put Salamis alongside of Trafal-&#xD;
gar ; for mere pictorial purposes, no doubt, the former&#xD;
would have been more acceptable to a Claude ; but&#xD;
as a manifestation of physical and intellectual power,&#xD;
how altogether inferior is it ! Why Nelson, with his&#xD;
good ship Victory alone, had he been there, would&#xD;
halve scattered the combined fleets of Greece and&#xD;
Persia, like so many chickens in a barn-yard. In&#xD;
one thing, however, I must join -issue with brother&#xD;
B., most distinctly ; I mean, in seeing more beauty&#xD;
in the painted tubs that figure in Yander Yelde's&#xD;
pictures, 'than in our own gallant clipper-ships. I&#xD;
think he libelled these last most atrociously. How-&#xD;

ever, every one to his notion. If he prefers creeping&#xD;
round the globe, in one of the former, with its awk-&#xD;
ward decks and clumsy arrangements and comfort-&#xD;
less accommodations, to a smart, dashing trip in one&#xD;
of the latter, it seems hard that he should be depri-&#xD;
ved of the privilege. By the same rule, he would&#xD;
no doubt also prefer, were it practicable, to go to sea,&#xD;
to-day, and test his stomach, and take his chance, in&#xD;
one of those same gilded galleys of Greece, or of&#xD;
Carthage, that he so eulogized, utterly unprovided as&#xD;
they were, with chart or compass, life-boat or life-&#xD;
preserver, to all the appointments and luxuries of a&#xD;
Collins' steamer. To me, I confess, such language&#xD;
.seems most unreasonable; a most ungrateful return for&#xD;
the manifold blessings and comforts that we moderns&#xD;
enjoy. Hie then went on to say, and seemed to take&#xD;
it for granted, that in pretty much all matters of&#xD;
taste and luxury, we were far behind the men of im-&#xD;
perial Rome ; that we could not begin to get up such&#xD;
dandies or curricles, dinners or dinner-services ; that&#xD;
our turbots, and the sauces we put upon them, were&#xD;
alike inferior to those discussed by Heliogabalus,&#xD;
etc., etc. I don't believe a word-of it. I believe the&#xD;
-facts are all the other way, and that there are a&#xD;
.thousand-fold more dainties and knick-knacks and&#xD;
objects of luxury, as well as of comfort, in the world,&#xD;
this day, than there ever were before. I am amazed&#xD;
that any man should think otherwise ; should pre-&#xD;
sume to say, that there was any such show or variety&#xD;

late or jelly, as those of our own merchant-princes&#xD;
nightly groan under ; or that the kitchen of Lucullus&#xD;
ever turned out any such complete works of art, as&#xD;
the foies gras and dindes truffees of Strasburg. I&#xD;
believe Heliogabalus would have given a province to&#xD;
have sat down to such a meal, as the carte of the&#xD;
Trois freres, or Very can furnish. That famous&#xD;
house of Nero, too ; what was there in it, to be named&#xD;
as a combination of beauty and utility, with one of&#xD;
the chandeliers of Cornelius ? Where, too, were its&#xD;
Paris clocks, and grand pianos'? No such pleasant'&#xD;
music, in those days. Where was their Punch, and&#xD;
&#xD;
Lantern, and Comic Almanac, and Illustrated News ?&#xD;
Where their Gift IBooks, and Monthlies, and Quar-&#xD;
terlies ? Why, a man has only to put his hands into&#xD;
his own pockets, to find a score of evidences of the&#xD;
progress of the world. Is there indeed, any want or&#xD;
whim, either of fop, epicure, or scholar, that cannot&#xD;
be gratified, in this age of contrivances ? But not to&#xD;
illustrate by small things, let us look at large ones.&#xD;
Take Chatsworth, then, as the exponent of modern&#xD;
civilization, and Adrian's villa, as that of the ancient ;&#xD;
and in which of these microcosms would the philoso-&#xD;
pher and the poet find most materials for thought&#xD;
and fancy ? Whose grounds would shew the most&#xD;
scientific planting and gardening, whose gardens the&#xD;
finest fruit? From whose conservatories could the&#xD;
lover cull the choicest bouquet for his mistress ?-&#xD;
The magnificence of the latter might be on a grander&#xD;
scale, but. surely it would be far more monotonous.&#xD;
There might be a few chef d'oeuvres in his galleries&#xD;
that his English brother could not rival; but as to&#xD;
the variety and suggestive character of their -con-&#xD;
tents, who can doubt which would 'have the prefer-&#xD;
ence ? The imperial library, too, might be more&#xD;
lofty, and its frescoes more brilliant. There might&#xD;
be some charming manuscripts in its alcoves, that&#xD;
we would gladly have, to-day.; but we see no Bible&#xD;
there, no Shakspeare, no Waverley Novels, no Rob-,&#xD;
inson Crusoe, no Vicar of Wakefield, none of those&#xD;
ten thousand other dear and precious books that&#xD;

two domains.. And what a shame it would be, if it&#xD;
were not so, seeing that the Duke hath a world&#xD;
twenty centuries older, and twice as large, to pick&#xD;
from, as the Emperor had. The discovery of Ame-&#xD;
rica; who can begin to estiftiate aright the accession&#xD;
to our knowledge, in all the kingdoms of nature, that&#xD;
has grown out of it? Why, had Niagara itself been&#xD;
the sole fruit of* the researches of Columbus, he&#xD;
would have been still entitled to the hearty thanks&#xD;
of the world; but when we think of the magnificent&#xD;
rivers, and forests, and boundless seas of fertile acres,&#xD;
that he has revealed to his brethren, and of the&#xD;
mighty part they are playing and to play in the&#xD;
drama of earth, what language can express his&#xD;
claims upon our admiration and gratitude? What&#xD;
are all the demi-gods of antiquity, alongside of a hero&#xD;
like this? But I must not linger any longer on this&#xD;
topic. How is it, then, as to the health of the world?&#xD;
Are we gainers in this regard, or losers? Here&#xD;
again III must differ from friend B. I think the sta&#xD;
tistics would be found against him. That we shame-&#xD;
fully neglect the rules of health, too many of us, and&#xD;
have to pay the bitter penalty, in consequence, and&#xD;
our children after us; that there are far too many&#xD;
martyrs all about us, to all sorts of intemperance, is,&#xD;
of course, not to be gainsaid. At the same time, I&#xD;
have no idea that we have any thing like the num-&#xD;
ber of sick, famine-pinched, deformed, crippled, muti-&#xD;
&#xD;
lated creatures, that defaced and disgraced the times&#xD;
of old. I believe that, take the world through, there&#xD;
is far more health, and comeliness, among the chil-&#xD;
dren of men, this day, than ever before, and that the&#xD;
improvement in this respect is the necessary result&#xD;
of a higher culture. I have no patience with the&#xD;
doctrine, that as the civilization of the race advances,&#xD;
its bodily vigor declines; that mental and physical&#xD;
power may not go together; that disease is the ever&#xD;
attendant slave upon the triumphs of genius. Oh,&#xD;
no; I believe that the greatest minds of the world&#xD;
have been, almost universally, in its soundest bodies;&#xD;
I believe, moreover, that there are far more such&#xD;
minds and bodies at work, this hour, than earth ever&#xD;
knew before. Besides, who can doubt that there are&#xD;
far more preventive against sickness, known to us,&#xD;
than there were to the ancients. Let me again cite&#xD;
India Rubber, that boon to humanity. What such&#xD;
shield against the assaults of the elements, had they&#xD;
in Greece or Rome 7 Surely, Hippocrates or Pliny&#xD;
would have made honorable mentiQn of it, had it ex-&#xD;
isted in their time, with its ten thousand ministra-&#xD;
tions unto human comfort. And as to remedies:&#xD;
who will say, that twenty added. c~rituries of obser~&#xD;
ovation, have not enlarged our stock of them? have&#xD;
not augmented our knowledge of the&#xD;
Grace that lies&#xD;

&#xD;
Surely, we have a larger assortment of mineral&#xD;
springs, than our elder brothers had, a more tho-&#xD;
rough analysis of them, and infinitely more facility&#xD;
of scattering their treasures' abroad ; we have a far&#xD;
choicer stock of climates to select from; a far more&#xD;
copious medicine-chest to prescribe from. Can any&#xD;
one doubt it ? Wouldn't Galen himself say so, were&#xD;
he here, to-day ? Wouldn't he confess, too, that&#xD;
there were no such hospitals in Rome, or Alexandria,&#xD;
or Athens, in his time, as our cities contain ; no such&#xD;
resources for the student, in, the way of lectures and,&#xD;
galleries and hqboratories and libraries ; no such&#xD;
comforts for the patient ? When he was Marcus&#xD;
Aurelius's doctor, Rome was in the very zenith of&#xD;
her splendor, having millions of souls within her&#xD;
walls, and filled with sumptuous edifices ; but among&#xD;
them all, we read of no asylum for orphan, foundling,&#xD;
or lunatic ; no Institution fc.- the Deaf and Dumb or&#xD;
Blind ; no Home for the Friendless ; no Eye or&#xD;
Ear Infirmary ; no Dispensary; in a word, of no&#xD;
provision, either by prince or people,:for the relief&#xD;
of the poor, infirm, or aged. It would be unjust,&#xD;
certainly, to infer from this silence, that the ancients&#xD;
utterly neglected these duties; but it would be&#xD;
equally unreasonable, I think, to suppose, that had&#xD;
there been any truly munificent outlay for such pur-&#xD;
poses, any thing at all comparable to the Greenwich&#xD;
or Chelsea Hospital, the Hotel Dieu or Invalides of&#xD;
our own day, that the memory of such benefactions&#xD;
&#xD;
A4&#xD;
&#xD;
could have thus utterly perished. Fame could not&#xD;
have been so neglectful~ of her deserving children.&#xD;
No, no ; these institutions belong to a far more civil-&#xD;
ized, Christianized age, as do all the appliances and&#xD;
contrivances that we find in them, to a far more&#xD;
learned one than that of Greece or Rome. I cer-&#xD;
tainly cannot believe, myself; that there were any&#xD;
such surgical instruments or performances then, as&#xD;
we now have ; any such beautiful operations in den-&#xD;
tistry, any such application of ether, any such arti-&#xD;
ficial legs or eyes, as ours. I have no idea that&#xD;
there was any apothecary's shop in any metropolis&#xD;
of antiquity, to be named in the same breath with&#xD;
our own Rushton's or Delluc's. The world -wasn't&#xD;
old or wise enough, hadn't half mineralogical, bota-&#xD;
nical, chemical knowledge enough, in a word, had&#xD;
neither the tools nor the wits, adequate to the pro-&#xD;
duction of any thing so superb, so complete and&#xD;
thorough in all its appointments, such a charming&#xD;
combination of science, skill. and taste. Will any&#xD;
one tell me, then, in the face of all these numberless&#xD;
resources in the way of prevention, and alleviation,&#xD;
and restoration, that the health of the world has&#xD;
gone behind hand ? It seems, to me, most unrea-&#xD;
sonable. 'But far more unreasonable and unjust&#xD;
still, was brother B.'s statement, that there was no&#xD;
more Freedom in the world to-day, than ever. How&#xD;
he could make it and contend for it as he did, in the&#xD;
face of such palpable, such glorious facts as we see&#xD;

all around usis' to me surprising. I shall, very&#xD;
briefly, reply to some few points urged by him. Af-&#xD;
ter first casting a very sorrowful glance over the'&#xD;
rest of the work1~ he then went on to illustrate his&#xD;
remarks by our own country, and to call in question&#xD;
the reality and~value of our privileges as freemen.&#xD;
And first, in matters of religion. He could see no more&#xD;
toleration in that regard, now than ever. He almost&#xD;
said, in so many words; that there was very little to&#xD;
choose, so far as peace and comfort were concerned,&#xD;
between the position of the infidel in New York to-&#xD;
day, and that of the Christian in Tarsus in the time&#xD;
of Paul; that the only change, indeed, that he could&#xD;
see, was in the character of the missiles employed,&#xD;
and not in the hearts of the persecutors, and that if&#xD;
the modern skeptic were less exposed than was the&#xD;
ancient believer to the downright, brutal violence of&#xD;
a mob, he was yet pretty sure to be pelted, all&#xD;
through life, with small slanders and libels, and to&#xD;
be subjected to affronts and annoyances innumera-&#xD;
ble. Now, this seems to me a most extravagant and&#xD;
unfair representation of the matter. I see no such&#xD;
spirit of persecution ~n the community myself. On&#xD;
the contrary, I see a great and constantly increasing&#xD;
spirit of toleration and courtesy, not merely between&#xD;
different denominations of Christians, but towards&#xD;
infidelity. I have no idea that the modest expres-&#xD;
sion of disbelief has any such penalties annexed to&#xD;
it, as brother B. so fancifully described; or that a&#xD;

young man of fai talents and blameless life, even&#xD;
though he be an avowed skeptic, need therefore be&#xD;
defrauded of a good wife, or a good business, or any&#xD;
other lawful prize that he may aspire to. If, indeed,&#xD;
he go out of his way to s~ieer and rail at Christi-&#xD;
anity, if he make a mock of the most sacred func-&#xD;
tions of the church, wherewith all our best affections&#xD;
and dearest associations are entwined, then must he&#xD;
be treated accordingly; must expect to have the&#xD;
doors of worthy men closed against him; and most&#xD;
righteously, as an offender against good-breeding and&#xD;
decency, and a disturbed of the public peace: but as&#xD;
to the honest doubts of the well-disposed man, surely&#xD;
there was never such a readiness as now, all over&#xD;
Christendom, to meet them in a spirit of candor and&#xD;
conciliation. How any intelligent observer can deny&#xD;
a fact so plain, so cheering as this, I confess amazes&#xD;
me. Equally fanciful and, extravagant seemed to&#xD;
me friend B.'s assertion as to the restrictions upon&#xD;
the freedom of motion, of the citizen, in our metro-&#xD;
polis. He could not have been in earnest, when he&#xD;
undertook to infer, from the occasional outrages of a&#xD;
gang of rowdies, in some obscure quarters of the&#xD;
town, or from the occasional shortcomings of a not&#xD;
yet perfectly developed police-system, that the great&#xD;
blessing in question is not practically enjoyed by the&#xD;
people; still less, when he undertook to say, that&#xD;
because there has been a breach of the peace now&#xD;
and then, in one or two wards of one or two cities&#xD;

nations, more equity in international law, more lib-&#xD;
erality in treaties, more humanity in war; a more&#xD;
merciful administration of justice, a better prison-dis-&#xD;

fling, I believe that what we call human life afi(l htv&#xD;
man nature, are just the same flOW flS CYCP, aU(l that;&#xD;
they will be so, unto the end. 1 believe that the&#xD;
history of 11w future will be substantially the his-&#xD;
tory of the past ; with the same lights and shadows.&#xD;
the same alternations and vicissitudes. I have no&#xD;
idea that the twentieth century of our era will 1)0 as&#xD;
brilliant a one as the present, or that the historian&#xD;
of the twenty-first will have any such triumphs of&#xD;
art or science to record, as we see to-day; but that&#xD;
there will be the same reaction that there always&#xD;
has been ; nay, that we shall have, in due season,&#xD;
t}ie dark ages over again; that the Course of Em-&#xD;
pire must be everywhere fulfilled; that it is not&#xD;
henceforth to be a mere flourish of rhetoric, a mere&#xD;
thought elaborated on canvas, but just as much the&#xD;
experience of nations yet unborn. as of those that&#xD;
perished ages ago. I believe that London and Paris&#xD;
are destined to be the same heaps of rtt~m~. that old&#xD;
iome and Ephesus now are; that our own land, after&#xD;
going through a glorious development, and reaching&#xD;
a higher point of culture in some respects, perhaps,&#xD;
than human annals have yet borne witness to, must,&#xD;
in tnrn, bow her. lofty head, ahd droop and. die, and&#xD;
return to her primitive desolation; must become the&#xD;
same beast-and-savage-haunted wilderness, that the&#xD;
men of Plymouth found her. I believe, in short,&#xD;
that the perfection to which brother A. looks for ward&#xD;
so hopefully, exists only in hi~ own ardent irriagina-&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
tion; that there never will he any better or wom~e&#xD;
men on earth than we have had already ; no IHtol&#xD;
leot more subtle than that of Aristotle, no heartier&#xD;
lover of truth than Socrates, no patriot that will&#xD;
ever dim the lustre of Washington's fame; and, en&#xD;
the other hand, no wretch that will ever make its for-&#xD;
get the atrocities of Ilerod or of Nero; that the&#xD;
planet was never intended to be the abode of angelic&#xD;
loveliness, or of ~endish malice, but the home of&#xD;
man, our brother; the same yesterday, to-day, and&#xD;
forever; the same compound of strength and of&#xD;
weakness, of good and of bad qualities, in the one&#xD;
hundred thousandth, as in the flrst century of hu-&#xD;
man history. I believe that the same impassable&#xD;
barriers exist now, and ever will, that ever have, to&#xD;
man's knowledge of those very things that yet most&#xD;
interest and disturb him ; to the know~ed~e of hi~&#xD;
own origin and destiny, of the principles of life, the&#xD;
phenomena of death, the wonders beyond the grave:&#xD;
that God hath not, either in his work3 or word, and&#xD;
never will give his children: while on earth. any&#xD;
more than the vaguest hints concernin~ these mrs-&#xD;
teries. I believe the same obstacles exist. and will&#xD;
exist, as ever, to the mental and moral progress of&#xD;
the race; obstacles growing out of these frail. crav-&#xD;
ing bodies' anti wayward minds of ours out M our&#xD;
native aversion to labors and l~ve of ease and self-&#xD;
indulgence ; and upon which no conceivable orgam-&#xD;

ao multiplication of books,' or schools, or teachers,&#xD;
can ever make any permanent unpression ; and&#xD;
therefore, that the great and good of earth will&#xD;
always be, as they have been, in sad disproportion&#xD;
to the ignorant and sinful. I believe that all the&#xD;
inequalities of endowments and condition, all the&#xD;
accidents, struggles, feuds, pains, sorrows of life,&#xD;
will exist while earth exists ; just as much as I be-&#xD;
lieve that men will ah~ays be looking sup at the same&#xD;

the same oceans that they now do; in a word, that&#xD;
the orchestra of nature, the drama of life will never&#xD;
chai~ge. I have not the remotest idea that we mor-&#xD;
tals will ever become so peaceful, wise, and happy,&#xD;
that the plays of Shakspeare will cease to interest&#xD;
us; save as curiosities; as the representatives of in-&#xD;
firmities and evils no longer extant; but that they&#xD;
will be the same faithful mirrors of humanity, ten&#xD;
thousand years' hence, as to-day. I have no doubt&#xD;
that there will be just as many whims to humor,&#xD;
follies to laugh at, vices to lash, crimes to punish,&#xD;
just as much work for the satirist, and caricaturist,&#xD;
and magistrate, in A. D. 18,530, as in the year of&#xD;
grace 1853; that life will be the same web of min-&#xD;
gled' yarn; the same many-colored thing as ever.&#xD;
I believe, too, that the children of men will be found&#xD;
living in the same old-fashioned homes as ever; not&#xD;
distributed in any orderly array of groups and se-&#xD;

that liberty, equality, and brotherhood will still con-&#xD;
tinue ~o be the same objects of desire, the same&#xD;
bright and beautiful illusions as ever. In short, I&#xD;
believe that the world will remain the same primary&#xD;
school for souls that it always has been; with the&#xD;
same feeble understandings to deal with, the same&#xD;
limited range of studies, the same rough discipline;&#xD;
that the brevity of life, the liability to sudden death&#xD;
and loss of reason, the infirmities of age, nay,&#xD;
that all the disappointments, inequalities, doubts~&#xD;

for his earthly children. .But not to expand or illus~-&#xD;
trate this thought at too great length, I would ask,&#xD;
what is there in it -so very irreverent, or unphiloso-&#xD;
phical, or discouraging. If I believe, as I most&#xD;
fervently do, in immortality, as proclaimed alike by&#xD;
reason and scripture, and in all the glories and ter-&#xD;
rors that are involved in it, what is there so repul~-&#xD;
sive in this picture of humanity Why should not&#xD;
just such a planet as earth have been set apart by&#xD;
God for just such as purpose ; as the first of a series&#xD;
of experiences, for the formation and .development&#xD;
of spiritual character ? Why, then, seek to disturb&#xD;
the arrangements-? Why break up this beautiful&#xD;
order of things ? Why call for a course of lessons, or&#xD;
system of discipline here, that would be inappropriate&#xD;
to our position ? Why fondly expect to realize on&#xD;
earth, those visions that can only become realities in&#xD;
a more advanced stage of our career ? Or why, on&#xD;
the other hand, madly and blasphemously pronounce&#xD;
all about us, mere vanity and rubbish ? Are not&#xD;
both these extremes, of credulous enthusiasm, and&#xD;
sneering skepticism, alike unreasonable ? There are&#xD;
ten thousand subtle and puzzling questions, of course,&#xD;
that grow out of such a thought, and which our poor&#xD;
wits cannot begin to fathom; but the thought itself&#xD;
seems to me the most natural and appropriate, nay,&#xD;
encouraging, that, could enter the mind ; certainly&#xD;
the mostin accordance with Christianity. Why else,&#xD;
indeed, was Christ sent on earth, to establish a per-&#xD;
&#xD;
(iLOUD'3 AND SUNShINE.&#xD;
&#xD;
165&#xD;
&#xD;
nmanent religion ? Why was that blessed medicine&#xD;
for souls given us, to last, as we believe, while man&#xD;
lasts, but because these very infirmities, sins, and&#xD;
sorrows with which it deals, are to be with us always?&#xD;
I am for taking the world, then, as I find it, with all&#xD;
its rough teachings and heart-vexing mysteries ; for&#xD;
playing my humble part and studying my. humble&#xD;
lesson as best I- may, without asking impertinent&#xD;
questions, the answers to which are wisely withheld&#xD;
from mc ; without clamoring for impracticable im-&#xD;
provements ; without grumbling, because the stripes&#xD;
may appear to be laid, at times, on the wrong backs,&#xD;
or because the sweets and bitters are not distributed&#xD;
according to my poor notions of right ; believing that&#xD;
as I advance from stage to stage of my spiritual edu-&#xD;
cation, all these problems will gradually be cleared&#xD;
up, and the wisdom and gopdness of the great Teacher&#xD;
.be made manifest. Of course, then, holding these&#xD;
views, I. cannot look forward to any such revolutions&#xD;
here below, as brother A. speaks of. As I said be-&#xD;
fore, his idea of a steady progress to perfection on&#xD;
earth, seems to me a mere fancy sketch. I have no&#xD;
faith in it. I believe thie world will remain as it is;&#xD;
that it will present the same motley spectacle, ages&#xD;
hence as now ; the same variety of phenomena, alike&#xD;
in nations and in individuals ; that it is not going to&#xD;
become one great garden, one scene of uniform peace&#xD;
and plenty and happiness ; or mankind a band of&#xD;

to the same bounteous table, interchanging tasks and&#xD;
sports and civilities, without distinction of rank,&#xD;

the same old song to sing in the long ages to come,&#xD;
as he is singing this hour ; the historian the same&#xD;
many-sided story to tell; that earth will have, then&#xD;
as now, her sterile and accursed spots, her noisome&#xD;
weeds and venomous reptiles ; that there will always&#xD;
be wildernesses enough for beasts to roam and howl&#xD;
in, ruins enough for owls to build in, and moralists&#xD;
to- muse over ; that her church-yards will always&#xD;
hold the saffie motley gathering of wise and simple,&#xD;
of young and aged sleepers ; that wars and famines&#xD;
and pestilences will still be sent forth upon their&#xD;
terrible missions ; that whirlwinds and earthquakes&#xD;
and volcanoes will still play their fearful, but God-&#xD;
appointed parts ; that there will always be, as now,&#xD;
the same warfare in the elements, and in the hearts&#xD;
of men ; yes, while the earth continues. to perform&#xD;
her journey through the skies. These things make&#xD;
life the battle it is ; 'this is the schooling, the train-.&#xD;
ing whereby God prepares his children for the more&#xD;
lofty and arduous tasks that are to follow. And is&#xD;
not the planet itself, all 'the more dear and interest--&#xD;
ing to us, on this very account ; as a place ,not in-&#xD;
tended to be handed over, either to angels or to&#xD;
devils, but set apart, forever, as the theatre of human&#xD;
action'? Why do we so love to linger over the tombs&#xD;

Because the men they commemorate or recall, were&#xD;

music of humanity,' that we listen to, the same that&#xD;
was chanted of old. And will not, for these very&#xD;
reasons, the same sighs be heard, the same homilies&#xD;
be read over our own remains and monuments, here-&#xD;
after ? -I have no doubt of it. I have no doubt that&#xD;
some future Marius will yet moralize over this same&#xD;
shattered metropolis of ours ; or that the traveler&#xD;
will, ages hence, be gathering wild flowers among&#xD;
the ivy-hidden ruins of Marshfield, as he gathers&#xD;
them, to-day, at the tomb of the Scipios.. And why&#xD;
not ? 'I repeat the question ; is not this view of hu-&#xD;

the one hand would turn this world into a paradise,&#xD;
for which God has not furnished the materials, or on&#xD;
the other, would treat it as so much rubbish only fit&#xD;
for the flames'? So it seems to me. Why then seek&#xD;
to alter God's arrangements ? Why should not the&#xD;
earth continue to play the. part thus assigned her,&#xD;
and as she still keeps on in her thousand-fold re-&#xD;
peated journey through the heavens, so keep on,&#xD;
through all time, telling the same old story, reading&#xD;
the same old lesson as ever, to man ; to man, alike&#xD;

courses of study, what more grand or subtle organi-&#xD;
zations may await us, in those other worlds, these&#xD;
things are all, in God's wisdom, hidden from us.- -&#xD;
Meanwhile, here we are, in the preparatory school,&#xD;
with its teachings and trials, corresponding to this,&#xD;
our spiritual childhood. Surely it is not a discour-&#xD;
aging, but a grand and inspiring thought, that this&#xD;
earth of ours is thus the beginning of a magnificent&#xD;
scheme of education ;' the first of a series of divine&#xD;
academies, for developing and perfecting that spirit-&#xD;
ual cultur-e, which our affections and understandings,&#xD;
which nature and revelation alike proclaim to be the&#xD;
destiny God hath in store for all his children. ~In&#xD;
this light, all the evils, and sorrows of life are as&#xD;
much divinely appointed teachers as their opposites;&#xD;
aidd that very preponderance of sin and suffering&#xD;
that we see about us, the arrangement of all others,&#xD;
the best suited to bring out both the passive and the&#xD;
active virtues; in a word, to make our schooling&#xD;
here, the most complete and thorough. Such, my&#xD;
friend, is my humble interpretation of the matter,&#xD;
an interpretation, endorsed, I think, by the soundest&#xD;
philosophy and poetry of the world, and by the Scrip-&#xD;
tures themselves. But I see you' don't agree with&#xD;
me.&#xD;
A. I certainly do not. Your doctrine seems to&#xD;
me to have far more assumption than proof about&#xD;
it, far more plausibility and ,poetry, than truth. It&#xD;
wodplelzzle you too, exceedingly, I think, to recon-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
cile it with the old-fashioned, scriptural notions,&#xD;
eithei- of this world, or the next. But, not to argue&#xD;
the point on scriptural grounds, the great cardinal&#xD;
objection I have to your theory, is its inevitable ten-&#xD;
dency to depress and discourage all efforts after im-&#xD;
provement. What can be. more disheartening than&#xD;
to tell me, that whatever I may do, or the genera-&#xD;
tion to which I belong, towards transmitting this&#xD;
trust, the earth, which we have received from our&#xD;
fathers. in a sounder condition to our children, will&#xD;
all amount to nothing ; that those very children, or&#xD;
theirs, will only undo all that we have been doing ;&#xD;
and that this is the history of the world from the&#xD;
beginning; that not an inch of veritable progress&#xD;
has been made, but that -we have. been describing&#xD;
the same dreary round ever since God .first made&#xD;
and blessed man? Why, what is this but a direct&#xD;
invitation to sloth and despondency ? I cannot, I&#xD;
will not accept such an idea. I do not believe that&#xD;
the deeds and lessons of the past have been so&#xD;
thrown away upon us. I will not so insult my Ma-&#xD;
ker, or -belie history, or the instincts of my own&#xD;
heart, as to cherish such a notion, and turn human&#xD;
life-into such a pitiful game of see-saw as this. I&#xD;
believe that God has a far higher destiny in store for&#xD;
earth, than the one yoiu describe ; nay, that h~tas&#xD;
given men the capacities and materials for working&#xD;
out the problem of perfection, here ; and that they&#xD;

but surely, working out that problem; that every&#xD;
day is adding facilities for its solution ; that there&#xD;
are now far more brains employed upon it, more&#xD;
truths shedding light upon it, than were ever known&#xD;
before ; and that, in God's good -time, the glorious&#xD;
consummation' will be reached-; yes, here, on earth,&#xD;
by living, breathing man. I cannot accept any&#xD;
thought less cheering than this.' This alone can&#xD;
animate me aright to the discharge of my humble&#xD;
part in pushing forward the blessed work. -I must&#xD;
discard your doctrine, then, my friend (fancifully and&#xD;
poetically as you have set it forthh, as an unsound one;&#xD;
as not in harmony either with the 'facts of history,&#xD;
or the statements of Scripture, or with the exquisite&#xD;
machinery and munificent arrangements of the nat.&#xD;
ural world ; in a 'word, as derogating fi-om the wis-.&#xD;
'dom and goodness of God.&#xD;
C. I see not that. .On the contrary, this' very&#xD;
distribution of parts and duties, among the different&#xD;
worlds of the Universe, whereby every star hath&#xD;
alike its prescribed path in space, and its prescribed&#xD;
system of discipline, differing from those of every&#xD;
other ; such a picture as this seems to me far more&#xD;
in keeping with our ideas of the divine perfections,&#xD;
and presents a far more varied, grand, and- exciting&#xD;
whole, for our contemplation, than yours of a monoto-&#xD;
nous perfection, alike toiled after, and alike consum-&#xD;
mated, in all. .&#xD;
A. Well, all such speculations, perhaps, ought to&#xD;
&#xD;
CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.&#xD;
&#xD;
171&#xD;
&#xD;
be frowned upon, as unbecoming and presumptuous&#xD;
in us poor mortals.. Still, if our imaginations will&#xD;
wander, at times, in such paths, I can't help think-&#xD;
ing my picture a far more delightful one than yours.&#xD;
Surely, the thought of a universe, in which good is&#xD;
everywhere finally triumphant, with -no solitary sin&#xD;
or sorrow lurking in a single star thereof, is more&#xD;
grateful, more worthy of our Father in heaven, than&#xD;
this ceaseless, terrible conflict between good. and&#xD;
evil, that you would thus seek to perpetuate. Be-&#xD;
sides, if this earth be the primary school you speak&#xD;
of; what right have you to assufie that its discipline&#xD;
has already been perfected; that. there will be no&#xD;
grander developments of character in it than the world&#xD;
has yet witnessed; no more profound discoveries -in&#xD;
moral and natural science, no new revelations of his&#xD;
will vouchsafed by God ? In. other words, that the&#xD;
future is to be a mere fac simile of the past'? I say,&#xD;
that- such a remark is mere gratuitous assertion. I&#xD;
don't believe it. I believe that there are manifold&#xD;
precious secrets yet to be found out by human wits,&#xD;
and that they are to work mighty influences on hu-&#xD;
man character and destiny; that these same schol-.&#xD;
ars are to have a far better chance than ever before ;&#xD;
that their numbers are to be continually augmented;&#xD;
.that the course of lessons is to be continually en-&#xD;
larged and amended ; that the comforts and conven-&#xD;

are to be better understood-; that the cannon and&#xD;

sunlight that this pseudo-perfection of yours, is but&#xD;
another Paine for destruction ; for taking all its&#xD;
form, color, relish from existence;- for knocking out&#xD;
of' the play all its meaning and moral. No, no, it&#xD;

CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.&#xD;
&#xD;
right have you to take for granted, as you do, that&#xD;
when this blessed consummation, this reign of peace&#xD;
and good-will, whi~~li both reason and scripture set&#xD;
before us, is reached at last, then forsooth, the world&#xD;
will not be worth living in; that there can be no&#xD;
entertainment, instruction, relish in life, without the&#xD;
perpetual presence of evil? Is there no such thing,&#xD;
then, as skill in art, or progress in science, but what&#xD;
is necessarily based on bodily or mental infirmities?&#xD;
Can there be no love, but that which binds up&#xD;
wounds? Are the secrets of nature, the domains&#xD;
of thought so easily e4austed'! Will there 15e no&#xD;
new varieties of beaut\Y, no new fields of inquiry,&#xD;
where all are alike students and brethren, to keep&#xD;
up the charm of existence, and to stimulate the wits&#xD;
of men? Nay, will tiiere not be loftier themes than&#xD;
ever, for the poet's lyre, the philosopher's homily?&#xD;
To doubt it, seems to me to call in question the re-&#xD;
sources of God's wisdom and goodness.&#xD;
B. I cati't agree with you. I can only say&#xD;
again, what I have so often repeated, that I do not&#xD;
believe the materials are.. to be found on earth, either&#xD;
for a natural or moral paradise. Every boy, of&#xD;
course, dreams of it in his turn.; but every thought-&#xD;
ful man must reject it as utterly impracticable.&#xD;
Yes, this same world-wide diffusftn of plenty, peace,&#xD;
and good will, that you are so forbi of dwelling upon,&#xD;
would be the very worst thing fo~ us, could we get&#xD;
it; the most unpalatable and unprofitable arrange-&#xD;
&#xD;
1'&#xD;

me1nt for humanity. The point seems to me too&#xD;
clear for argument. As certainly as the inequali-&#xD;
ties in the face of nature are necessary to give&#xD;
beauty and interest to the landscape, so are the ine-&#xD;
qualities of human condition essential to all enjoy-&#xD;
ment and instruction. As certainly as the coming&#xD;
together of the sour and sweet gives its flavor to&#xD;
the fruit, so the perpetual collision of good and evil,&#xD;
of pain and pleasure, constitutes the very relish of&#xD;
existence. The idea of altering this divine arrange-&#xD;
ment, of banishing these eternal contrasts, seems&#xD;
little less th~r~ blasphemous. No; I am for taking&#xD;
the world as God made it; for swallowing the&#xD;
draught as the great Physician hath mixed it. I&#xD;
ask no emancipation from the temptations or the cas-&#xD;
ualties of life. Let me fight the good, old-fashioned&#xD;
fight appointed unto Adam, and all his children.&#xD;
Let me fairly earn and receive my stripes or laurels,&#xD;
according to my conduct. Let me struggle as I best&#xD;
may, with the motley crowd about me; not idly at-&#xD;
tempting to convert it into an orderly procession of&#xD;
philosophers, but taking it as I find it; the same&#xD;
par ti-col~red gathering of peers and paupers, of&#xD;
saints and sinners, that it has been from the begin-~&#xD;
ning; the same old crowd that homer sang to, that&#xD;
Raffaelle piiinted from, that Shakspeare studied;&#xD;
and life itself, the same diVinely prepared compound&#xD;
of good and evil, of sweet and bitter, of jest and&#xD;
earnest, that it always was, and will be through all&#xD;

tify any such assumption. Nay, they tell quite the&#xD;
opposite story to me. A~e there not cities on earth&#xD;
this hour, that have celebrated their thousandth&#xD;

symptoms of corruption or decay, are growing arid&#xD;
thriving continually? II have no idea, myself that&#xD;
either London, or Paris, or New York will ever die&#xD;
that death you speak of; that they will ever be&#xD;
lodgings for wild beasts, but will continue unto the&#xD;
end, the same centres of. trade, the same head-quar-&#xD;

altogether, your version, my friend. Dr~ss it up in.&#xD;
what gay robes you will, plead for it as persuasively&#xD;
as you may, it yet seems to me unsound, sophistical,&#xD;
nay, heathenish. It may minister unto a morbid&#xD;
fancy, but it discourages all healthful exertion. I&#xD;
have no patience with it; this perpetual holding up&#xD;
of the past as the model, this want of faith in the&#xD;
present, this unwillingness to admit what appears to&#xD;

like ours, the very laws of' whose being are ceaseless&#xD;
change and conflict. No, no; .a world without its&#xD;
sorrows and its ruins, what charm could it have for&#xD;
student or traveler'? A history, that had no bloody&#xD;
wars and tottering thrones to tell of, no crimes and&#xD;
vices in it, how soon would it weary and repel the&#xD;
reader ! And why ? Because it would not be the&#xD;
history of man;. of man as he was in the firstrage,&#xD;
as he will be, in the last age of earth. How idle to&#xD;
question, how wild to seek to change these things !&#xD;
I say again, then, call. this a dreary round, if -you&#xD;
will;- to me it is none the less a divine drama ; nay,&#xD;
I take comfort, I rejoice in the thought, that the ~&#xD;
scenes and characters of this drama, will remain the&#xD;
same, through all time ; to feel that I am heaving&#xD;
*      the same sighs; shedding the same tears, struggling&#xD;
*  ~  with the same doubts, obstacles, temptation, as did&#xD;
my brethren of the patriarchal ages ; just a~s much&#xD;
as I am looking up at the same stars, am surrounded&#xD;
by the. same flowers, listening to the music of the&#xD;
same brooks.&#xD;
A. Well, well, my friend, we shall never agree' on&#xD;
this point. You cling to your idea, certainly, with&#xD;
commendable firmness, and illustrate it, with char-&#xD;
acteristic copiousness. None the less, however,&#xD;
must I fight against it. Especially do .I deny the&#xD;
force of your last illustration. I deny that we men&#xD;
of to-day, are looking up at the same stars, .are con-&#xD;
lined 'to the same scanty range of flowers or fruits,&#xD;
&#xD;
1~&#xD;
&#xD;
CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.&#xD;
&#xD;
181&#xD;
&#xD;
that the patriarchs were. I say, there are far more&#xD;
stars in Our heavens, and that we know far&#xD;
more about them; that we have far more copi-&#xD;
ous and dainty fare, both for mind- and bodyr, than&#xD;
the men of old had.; that the brook's music hath far&#xD;
more meaning in it than ever before ; that the brook&#xD;
itself is playing a nobler part than ever ; that its&#xD;
waters are less often stained with blood ; that all&#xD;
the brooks and rivers of earth have far more beauty&#xD;
and significance, than ever ; that they are not, as of&#xD;
yore, mere boundaries of hostile kingdoms, and scenes&#xD;
of conflict, but are more and more becoming peace-&#xD;
makers, and blessed ministers unto human industry ;&#xD;
that the landscapes of earth have more amenity, more&#xD;
of the smiling labors of peace in them, than ever ;&#xD;
nay, that the prospect from every mountain-top, bears&#xD;
witness to the glorious progress-doctrine that 'I&#xD;
preach, and shall persist in preaching, my friend, in&#xD;
spite of all that you have urged. I say again, the&#xD;
facts of history are all on that side of the question.&#xD;
Every day's reading and observation strengthen me&#xD;
in this belief. I have already dwelt on this point, in&#xD;
talking with brother B., and must not repeat myself.&#xD;
I believe then, most fervently, in the reality of that&#xD;
progress. I believe that there are far more acres,&#xD;
and brains, under cultivation, to-day, than the world&#xD;
ever knew before ; more hearts alive to truth, more&#xD;
rational faith, more ardent piety&#xD;
C. Ah, no, no' ;I can't agree with you there. It&#xD;

&#xD;
seems to me, that there was a fervor about the piety&#xD;
Qf antiquity, that we have quite lost, in our day; a&#xD;
hearty, earnest communion with God, to which our&#xD;
worship is tame and frigid; a simple, child-like faith,&#xD;
for the loss of which, we are poorly compensated by&#xD;
all our pompous rituals, all our elaborate treatises&#xD;
on Natural Theology.&#xD;
A. I don't think so. I say, on the contrary, that&#xD;
we are far nearer God than ever we were. I cannot&#xD;
listen to the doctrine, that science tends to withdraw&#xD;
man from his Maker. He that knows best the works&#xD;
of God, sees best the friend and father in them. The&#xD;
most learned philosophers have ever been the most&#xD;
filial and devoted worshippers. If here and there a&#xD;
rebellious nature is found, perverting the lessons of&#xD;
the - great volume, thank heaven, they are rare ex-&#xD;
ceptions. And how can it be otherwise? Piety and&#xD;
knowledge must, from the very nature of things, sus-.&#xD;
tam and elevate each other. As the learning of the&#xD;
world increases, so must the intensity and fervor of&#xD;
its faith increase; I quarrel not with the faith of&#xD;
the patriarchs; it was a blessed thing, in its day,&#xD;
and in entire accordance with their scanty knowledge&#xD;
of the frame of things about them; but oh, compare&#xD;
it not with the enlightened, the sublime faith of a&#xD;
Newton. And this latter kind of faith it is, that I&#xD;
maintain is continually increasing in the world, with&#xD;
all other desirable things, in the ever onward march&#xD;
of mind. Progress, progress, progress; yes, my&#xD;
&#xD;
182&#xD;

'ii&#xD;

&#xD;
friend, I must cling fast to the glorious thought. I&#xD;
bQlieve in the ultimate redemption of the race from&#xD;
sin anti ignorance. I believe the day will yet dawn,&#xD;
when the whole earth will bear witness to the same&#xD;
blessed changes, the same emancipation from idolatry&#xD;
and bloodshed, that the great poet so eloquently sets&#xD;
forth, as having taken place on the borders of his&#xD;
own loved lake. You may remember the passage.&#xD;
He is pointing, as he speaks, to a placid cove, shut&#xD;
in by hills, and illuminated by a magnificent sunset,&#xD;
which he has just been describing.&#xD;
"Once, while the name, Jehovah, was a sound&#xD;
Within the circuit of this sea-girt isle&#xD;
Unheard, the savage nations bowed the head&#xD;
To gods delighting in remorseless deeds;&#xD;
Gods which themselves had fashioned, to promote&#xD;
Ill purposes, and flatter foul desires.&#xD;
Then, in the bosom of yon mountain~cove,&#xD;
To those inventions of corrupted man&#xD;
Mysterious rites were solemnized; and there,&#xD;
Amid impending rocks and gloomy woods,&#xD;
Of those terrific idols sore4 received&#xD;
Such dismal service, that the loudest voice&#xD;
Of the swoln cataracts (which now are heard&#xD;
Soft murmuring) kvas too weak to overcome,&#xD;
Though aided by wild winds, the groans and shrieks&#xD;
Of human victims, offered up to appease&#xD;
Or to propitiate. And, if living eyes&#xD;
had visionary faculties to see&#xD;
The thing that hath been as the thing that is,&#xD;
Aghast might we behold this crystal Mere&#xD;
Bedimmed with smoke, in wreaths voluminous,&#xD;

And full assemblage of a barbarous host;&#xD;
Or to Andates, female Power! who gave&#xD;
(For so they fancied) glorious victory.&#xD;
A few rude monuments of mountain-stone&#xD;
Survive; all else is swept away. How bright&#xD;
The appearance~ of things! From such, how changed&#xD;
The existing worship; and with those compared,&#xD;

So wide the difference, a willing mind&#xD;
Might almost think, at this affecting hour,&#xD;
That paradise, the lost abode of man,&#xD;
Was raised again; and to a happy few,&#xD;
In its original beauty, here restored."&#xD;
And is not this same blessed chang~~, my friend, yet&#xD;
to be the destiny of earth? I believe it. I believe&#xD;
that Civilization and Christianity are to play no less&#xD;
a part than this; are, in God's good time, so to mould&#xD;
and temper our passions, and develop our powers,&#xD;
that this same paradisewill be raised again, and re-&#xD;
stored, not to~ the happy few, but to the whole family&#xD;
of man.&#xD;
C. Never, never; 'tis 'the enthusiast's dream,&#xD;
that you describe, not God's future. But suppose it&#xD;
realized; suppose this ~blessed consummation to be&#xD;
reacl~ed, and all the wars, famines, and pestilences,&#xD;
all the follies,, sins, and sorrows of earth banished;&#xD;

Where would it finally lead us? How many gene-&#xD;
rations would it take to bring us to the inevitable&#xD;
upshot of it all, an overstocked planet? Yes, a&#xD;
world groaning under a load of life, that it could no&#xD;
longer carry; crowded with beings, whose mental as&#xD;
well as physical wants it could nQt supply? He&#xD;
would be a bold calculator, to be sure, who would un-&#xD;
dertake to furnish dates and figures, in reply to&#xD;
these questions; but, my friend, what child cannot&#xD;
see that such a catastrophe would be the necessary&#xD;
result of that unrestrained prosperity, that world-&#xD;
wide reign of peace and good will to which you look&#xD;
forward? You smile, I see, at the idea of &amp;amp;ertask-&#xD;
ing the productive power of the earth, and of ex-&#xD;
hausting its sources of knowledge; and yet, who&#xD;
knows but what we should have reached that very&#xD;
result this very hour, had the past been what you&#xD;
would make the future? Who knows whether there&#xD;
would have been an acre of wild land left for the&#xD;
cultivator, a solitary new enterprise to stimulate the&#xD;
capitalist or the philanthropist, a single new field of&#xD;
knowledge for the student? At any rate, this would&#xD;
be the final result of such a state of things. Where&#xD;
then would this vision of yours be? How gladly,&#xD;
then, would you hail the return of those very evils&#xD;
that you are so intent on banishing, as blessed min-&#xD;
isters sent to relieve the earth from its frightfu4&#xD;

part of the divine economy? I repeat it; had men&#xD;
all lived out their threescore and ten years from the&#xD;
beginning, ahd women all been fruitful ; had there&#xD;
been no undeveloped faculties, no wasted hours, no&#xD;
neglected enterprises, no lost arts, no follies, vices,&#xD;
wars in the world, no relapse of nations into barba-&#xD;
rism, and of cities into wildernesses, is it not alto-&#xD;
gethe r likely that there would have been a most&#xD;
comfortable crowd of us on earth, this vcry moment,&#xD;
clamoring for food and employment, I had almost&#xD;
said for very standing room? Would we not have&#xD;
reached a crisis, the only relief for which would be&#xD;
that same throat-cutting, pestilence, and untimely&#xD;
death, that we so idly seek to extirpate from the&#xD;
world? Would we p&amp;amp;t be enduring at last, and in&#xD;
one hideous mass, tse very calamities that the&#xD;
race has been receiving piece-meal, as we find them&#xD;
scattered over the different ages and nations of&#xD;
earth? Would not this be the issue of this same&#xD;
Visionary paradise of yours? I think so.&#xD;
A. Not at all, not at all. On the contrary, had&#xD;
men played their parts in the way you describe, I&#xD;
believe that earth would have presented, today, a&#xD;
spectacle as much more lovely and interesting than&#xD;
the one we see, as that surpasses what~it was when&#xD;
it came wild from the. hands of God. There would&#xD;
have been some precious things missing from the&#xD;
picTure, that we now have, certainly; many rare&#xD;
works of art, commemorative of past trials and sor-&#xD;
&#xD;
CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.           187&#xD;
rows; many monuments to goodness, many piles&#xD;
dedicatedd to charitable uses there would, of course,&#xD;
have been no occasion for, no significance in these&#xD;
things, in a world where all were alike good and&#xD;
happy; but who can doubt that there would have&#xD;
been glorious substitutes for them; temples reared&#xD;
to Faith, and Science, and Industry; ten thousand&#xD;
additions to our flowers and fruits, to all the pro-&#xD;
ducts of intelligent culture, in every walk of art:&#xD;
ten thousand new manifestations of beauty and of&#xD;
truth, in every department of knowledge. Your pic&#xD;
ture seems to me as untrue as it is horrible. The&#xD;
idea that any such catastrophe as you speak of,&#xD;
should be the result of an universal obedience to the&#xD;
Creator's laws, what a reflection is it on that Crea-&#xD;
tor's goodness! How unreasonable, too, for you to&#xD;
insist as you do on sin and sorrow as divine ordi-&#xD;
nances, as indispensable parts of God's government!&#xD;
I have no patience with a doctrine that may be so&#xD;
readily perverted as this; that endorses and sanc-&#xD;
tions wickedness; that turns every vagabond and&#xD;
ruffian into an agent of the Almighty, an essential&#xD;
feature in the discipline of life. I do not believe&#xD;
that God thus seeks to perpetuate evil. Every&#xD;
transgression, every abuse of our freedom is offen-&#xD;
sive in his eyes, and must be paid for in full, here or&#xD;
hereafter. He hath no pleasure either in the sin or&#xD;
the suffering. lIe would infinitely prefer that all&#xD;
his children, this hour, all over the universe, were&#xD;

us to starvation and wretchedness, in the way you&#xD;
speak of; that he hath made no niore generous pro-&#xD;
vision than that for his earthly- tenants, and that&#xD;
this same blessed consummation which they had&#xD;
reached at last, would soon compass its own destruc-&#xD;
tion, how monstrous, how blasphemous a notion is&#xD;
it ? .He would be a bold arithmetician, as you said,&#xD;
who would presume to fix a date for any such ca-&#xD;
lamity, or to set down in figures the productive pow-&#xD;
er of a planet like ours. To count, weigh, or meas-&#xD;
u-e the returns it gives, even now, to our scanty and&#xD;
11 methodical labor, would be no light undertaking ;&#xD;
but what imagination can conceive of the extent or&#xD;
variety of the crops that would respond to a world-&#xD;
wide and scientific culture? And is there not a cor-&#xD;
responding munificence in God's provision for our&#xD;
intellectual wants ? How romantic to suppose that&#xD;
we can so easily exploreand exhaust -the treasures&#xD;
of truth, all around us ; that the charm and stimulus&#xD;
of novelty could ever be wanting ; that there would&#xD;
not be new beauties continually springing up for the&#xD;
poet to celebrate, new discoveries continually reward-&#xD;
ing the toils of 'the philosopher ! But suppose we&#xD;
did know (as in God's good time, we will,) precisely&#xD;
the number of human beings that the earth could&#xD;
comfortably sustain, when tasked to its utmost capa-&#xD;
city, where would be the difficulty ; what the neces-&#xD;

.sity for any such horrible scenes as you describe ?&#xD;
Would not the good sense of mankind accommodate&#xD;
itself to the limits thus ascertained? In the univer-&#xD;
sal temperance, loyalty, wisdom, that would prevail,&#xD;
would there be any danger of transgressing them ?&#xD;
C. And do you really, my friend, think the day&#xD;
will ever- come, when the passions will be thus tho-&#xD;
roughly subjugated ; when wisdom will thus every-&#xD;
where preside, alike over all the great and small&#xD;
things of life ? If so, indeed, why then of course&#xD;
this same paradise of yours will be reached, and&#xD;
kept, safe and bright and beautiful, for aught I see,&#xD;
through all eternity. But I repeat it, I see nothing&#xD;
to justify any such expectations, either in the his-&#xD;
tory of the past, or the phenomena of the present,&#xD;
I see no preparations making in my own inner man,&#xD;
or around me, for any such thorough revolution in&#xD;
-the planet ; nor do I see either the physical or&#xD;
moral materials adequate to produce it. I cannot&#xD;
.look forward, therefore, to any such radical changes&#xD;
in the feelings, experiences, annals, and dictionaries&#xD;
of the world. On the contrary, I believe that the&#xD;
old passions will be just. as vigorous, and .the old&#xD;
.song-books, story-books, play-books that tell about&#xD;
them, will be just as fresh and popular in the last&#xD;
year of earth as they are 'to-day ; that Scripture and&#xD;
history and reason will be teaching precisely the&#xD;
same lessons, sounding the same warnings, then as&#xD;
now ; in a word, that human nature was not design-&#xD;

scene you so love to linger on, any more than these&#xD;
poor, easily fatigued senses of ours could endure the&#xD;
glare and noise of an uninterrupted day.&#xD;
A. Well, well, we can't agree, I see. None the&#xD;
less, my friend, must I cling to the blessed thought,&#xD;
far more animating and inspiring as it is; far more&#xD;
likely to make heroes and philanthropists, than that&#xD;
perpetual preponderance of evil, that endless series&#xD;
of sins and sorrows, that you so insist upon!&#xD;
C. But what says brother B.? He certainly&#xD;
don't look as if he saw any very brilliant prospects&#xD;
ahead, in either world. How is it, my friend 3 Do&#xD;
you still hold fast to your old views, or has friend&#xD;
A.'s eloquence here, somewhat shaken your skepti-&#xD;
cism?&#xD;
B. Oh, I've nothing to say for myself, more than&#xD;
I have already said. There is an individual, to be&#xD;
sure, could we only get at him, wh6 might favor us&#xD;
with some really valuable facts and prophecies upon&#xD;
these points.&#xD;
C. Andwhomayhebe?&#xD;
i~. The man in the moon. He, of course, has&#xD;
watched all that has been going on here below, from&#xD;
the commencement; ~and I dare say, has kept most&#xD;
copious and accurate records thereof. If we only&#xD;
had power, now, to send for persons and papers, he&#xD;
might shed a deal of comfortable light on these&#xD;
vexed questions.&#xD;

C&#xD;
A. Sarcastic and skeptical as evcr, I see.&#xD;
B. Yes, I am. I own it. I cannot get up any&#xD;
faith, either in your own fancy-future of this world,&#xD;
or in brother C.'s picture of endless progress in the&#xD;
worlds to come. Both seem to me alike visionary,&#xD;
alike unsatisfactory. I certainly agree with him,&#xD;
however, in looking forward to none of these radical&#xD;
changes that you do, in human affairs. I believe&#xD;
that human life will continue to be the same old song&#xD;
in the grass it now is, while that grass continues to&#xD;
grow. So long as God condescends to keep this&#xD;
sorry ball in motion, so long will the children of&#xD;
men keep up the same old, sorry game on it, as ever.&#xD;
I can't help thinking so. Why these things are&#xD;
thus decreed, why God permits all these puzzles,&#xD;
sins, and sorrows, how long they are to last, what is&#xD;
,to be the upshot of it all, these are topics, as I said&#xD;
before, about which we have been fretting, chatter-&#xD;
Ang, scolding, shedding ink and blood without meas-&#xD;
ure, ever since language was first organized; and&#xD;
yet, what comfortable knowledge have we about&#xD;
them to-day, any more than when the sun of the first&#xD;
day went down? At least, soit seems to me. Oth-&#xD;
ers may be fortunate enough to rea4 in God's book&#xD;
of nature, or in what they are pleased to call reve-&#xD;
lation, or in historic records, satisfactory answers to&#xD;
all these questions ; to me, all is doubt and perplex-&#xD;
ity. Meanwhile, with brother C., I see no indica-&#xD;

immediate prospect of having one current hand for&#xD;

as will render obsolete the fees of doctors, or the&#xD;
manifestos of quacks; any such all-prevailing piety&#xD;
and love of justice, as will vacate the mission of the&#xD;

whatever new means of education he may devise,&#xD;
will very speedily, or indeed ever, make any perm~-&#xD;

self-indulgent propensities of the massed ; but&#xD;
that they will always be the same creatures of&#xD;
appetite and impulse, the same sheep following after&#xD;
their leaders, that all history proclaims them. The&#xD;
idea that education will alter these things, ~ivill ever&#xD;
root out the native perverseness of oi~r hearts, or&#xD;
overcome the essential inequalities of our minds, how&#xD;
unreasonable, how opposed to all experience is it !-&#xD;
We may wish, and theorize, and plan, to the contrary,&#xD;

not believe, then, in the triumphal career of the&#xD;
schoolmaster, victorious over all the evils and follies&#xD;

not 'believe either, in any forthcoming revolution in&#xD;

manifest the same old4hshioned frowardness; anti&#xD;
turbulence, and, disposition to overload their young&#xD;

actions, as ever. Still less do I believe that the&#xD;

that "the piping cry of lips,. that brook no pain and&#xD;
small suspense," is no longer to be heard on earth;&#xD;
but, in its stead, the merry notes of babes, that will&#xD;
come singing and dancing into a world, all light and&#xD;
gladness. And so with the adults. It is a pretty&#xD;
idea, certainly, that of the sun shining on a world-&#xD;
wide family of brethren and sisters, all alike well-&#xD;
formed, well-fed, well-dressed, and well-behaved; all&#xD;
alike good talkers, sound reasoners, faithful doers;&#xD;
but I would ask, not in what kingdom, but in what&#xD;
township of earth, are there any bona fide prepara.-&#xD;
tions making, for any such consummation? Where-&#xD;
ever I go, I ~ee the same old-fashioned infirmities&#xD;
and troubles, the same inequalities of' condition and&#xD;
&#xD;
endowments, the same preponderance of bad gram-&#xD;
mar, and bad logic; of selfishness and sensuality;&#xD;
the same imperfect sympathies, and unreasonable&#xD;
antipathies, and absurd jealousies and feuds, the&#xD;
same vices and crimes, that have formed three-quar-&#xD;
ters df the histories of all nations and parishes, from&#xD;
the beginning.&#xD;
A. You have no faith whatever, then, in any sub.-&#xD;
stantial improvements in the morals or manners of&#xD;
the world; any real progress in its knowledge or&#xD;
religion?&#xD;
B. Not much. I believe with brother C., that&#xD;
we have already, pretty much sounded the depths&#xD;
and scaled the heights within which all human effort&#xD;
is doomed to vibrate. I dare say there are a few&#xD;
scientific truths to be found out, yet; a few inven-&#xD;
tions in store for us, that are to be of more or less&#xD;
service to humanity. I have no doubt, either, that&#xD;
we are going to have pretty stirring times on earth&#xD;
for some years ahead; that there are to be a good&#xD;
many miles of wires stretched and rails laid; a large&#xD;
and growing family of locomotives and steamers, to&#xD;
run our errands; in short, a great and unreasonable&#xD;
expansion of business, throughout the world; to be&#xD;
followed by as unreasonable a panic, and revulsion,&#xD;
and absurd fall of prices, and 'extinction of fancy&#xD;
stocks. No doubt there are, still, a few latent trea-&#xD;
sures, in all the kingdoms of nature; a few stray&#xD;
herbs, and fruits, and minerals, that the eye of sci-&#xD;

ence has not yet lighted on. They will doubtless&#xD;
come along, in God's good time, with the customary&#xD;
perils and sacrifices on the part of their discoverers.&#xD;
will be duly christened and sent forth into the world&#xD;
with the usual trumpet-flourish, as wonder-workers&#xD;
and revolutionizers ; will be received with the same&#xD;
old-fashioned sneers and shrugs, on the one hand, the&#xD;
same gaping credulity, on the other ; and so- fall in&#xD;
time to their proper level, of greater or less utility&#xD;
or harm to the race. Whose experience does not&#xD;
suffciently enlighten hiin on these points ? You&#xD;
and I, my friend, are old enough to remember when&#xD;
the Tomato first left its native woods, and made its&#xD;
debutin the civilized world. What a cold shoulder&#xD;
people gave it, at first ; what an absurd reaction&#xD;
there was in its favor, afterwards ! For weeks, the&#xD;
papers were full of .it. Its praises were chanted&#xD;
without measure, as the great boon of humanity,&#xD;
God's last, best gift to his children; at once, meat&#xD;
and sauce, fruit and vegetable, tonic and cathartic.&#xD;
Nothing was heard of; in all circles, but Tomato&#xD;
soups, and salads, and catsups, and tarts, and pud-&#xD;
}ings, and pills, and powders. It even gave its name&#xD;
to clubs and benevolent associations and packet-ships.&#xD;
One enthusiast, you may remember, our friend .&#xD;
(like yourself, by the way, an ardent admirer of&#xD;
Wordsworth,) even went so far as to commence an&#xD;
epic poem, in its honor. But it sank, at last, to its&#xD;
true position, as a piquant addition to, and not a re-&#xD;

these fanciful organizations of society, these ever-shift-&#xD;

and servant, judge and crier, sexton and pastor, cap-.&#xD;

extirpation of vice ; these periodical distributions of&#xD;
property, that dreamers and demagogues have been&#xD;
crying up, from time immemorial, as grand panaceas&#xD;
for all the ailments of the body politic: no man will&#xD;
deny, that there are some few grains of wisdom and&#xD;
goodness, mixed up with all the folly and madness of&#xD;
their projectors; that there may be peculiar cases,&#xD;
and local affections, wherein even Agrarianism and&#xD;
Socialism might be of service;' but the idea of hold-&#xD;
ing them up to the world, as the great medicines of&#xD;
humanity, the miracle-workers, that are to revolu-&#xD;
ticonize alike the hearts of men, and the face of nature,&#xD;
seems to me too thoroughly childish to waste one' s&#xD;

of their brethren. Meanwhile, the old chronic com-&#xD;
plaints of the race will subsist in full force, the old&#xD;
passions retain their supremacy, and life itself re-&#xD;
main the same sad, strange drama, with the same&#xD;
motley performers, as ever. I say again, then, with&#xD;
brother C., that I cannot see any of the preliminary&#xD;
movements towards this paradisaical consummatiQn&#xD;
of yours. It looks to me as if the old' arrangements,&#xD;
the old contrasts of good and evil, sweet and bitter,&#xD;
high and low, fat and lean, wise and simple, were&#xD;
going to last, as long as night and day last; and one&#xD;
half of the world Thontinue to live as ever, by minis-&#xD;

innocent desires, but to the caprices, vices, crimes of&#xD;
the other half. I do not believe that we shall ever&#xD;
outgrow these arrangements-that with all our pro-&#xD;
gress, we shall ever outrun the constable; or that&#xD;
Jack Ketch will retire from business, any sooner&#xD;

ways be a fair market, not only for false teeth and&#xD;
wigs, but for Anglesey legs, and pasteboard noses;&#xD;
a fair' opening for chir~podists of talent, even unto&#xD;
the closing scene. I believe, too, that the balls of&#xD;

Call me croaker, if you will; I still can't help think-&#xD;
ing that the last generation of earth will have full&#xD;

shortcomings in it, as our own; as many unreturned&#xD;
umbrellas, unsettled bills, uncalled-for dividends,&#xD;
robbed orchards, stolen kisses, runaway matches,&#xD;
fraudulently obtained signatures, feloniously exchan-&#xD;

faith shown towards its tailors, as much turbulence&#xD;
~nd villainy in its hack-drivers, as much struggling&#xD;
and scuffling for the choice dishes, in the hotels o?&#xD;
its watering-places. So far from looking fo rward to&#xD;
the balmy airs, sweet flowers, and pleasant music, of&#xD;
this same Paradise of yours, I can't help feeling that&#xD;
the same old eyesores and discords of earth will ever&#xD;
prevail, as now; and that the noses of the long gen-&#xD;
erations to come will have the same vile smells to&#xD;
encounter, as our own; and that the same neglect,&#xD;
filth, and corruption, will be at the bottom of them.&#xD;
I have no faith, I confess, in any thorough o~ lasting&#xD;

the faith, and patience, and skill, and guano, to come&#xD;
from, that are to work such changes? It is easy&#xD;
enough to sit in our arm-chairs, and talk down all&#xD;
the nuisances, drain all the marshes, subdue all the&#xD;
stubborn soils, soften all the harsh climates of earth,&#xD;
blot out all the Dismal Swamps and Dead Seas, and:&#xD;
Hard- Scrabble hills,' and Break-Neck hollows from&#xD;

things? God has withheld the materials, both with-&#xD;

discipline in said schools of sharks will remain un-&#xD;

being, then as now, to keep as much as possible out&#xD;
of the way of the larger fish, and in the way of the&#xD;
smaller ones, during meal-times. I believe, too, that&#xD;
there will be quite as many land-sharks about; and&#xD;
that the same shark-like views and propensities will&#xD;
continue to be manifested alike in the business trans-&#xD;
actions of nations, and of individuals; that there&#xD;
will be as many absurd wars about trifles, as many&#xD;
bad treaties negotiated over good brandy, as many&#xD;
government frauds and frauds on governments, as&#xD;

up his royal state for some time yet; if he be com-&#xD;
pelled to retire before the march of mind, and va-&#xD;
cate some of his kingdoms, will not time, and lux-&#xD;
ury, and war, be preparing new wildernesses for him,&#xD;
as of old? I believe it.* At any rate, I have no&#xD;
idea that he will ever so far forget his native ~ma-&#xD;
jesty, as to bow the neck to, and become the drudge&#xD;
of man. I have no faith whatever in any thorough&#xD;
or permanent subjugation, either of the wild beasts&#xD;
or wild lands of earth; but think, with brother 0.,&#xD;
that there will always be ruins enough scattered&#xD;
about for artists to sketch from, deserts enough for&#xD;
winds to howl over. Still less2 do I believe that we&#xD;
are to bow the elements to our wills; that any con-&#xD;
trivances of art can rob the whirlwind of its terrors,&#xD;
or turn the thunder-storm into a pastime, or the&#xD;
earthquake into a pleasant excitement, or convert.&#xD;
the volcano into' a mere piece of pyrotechny. On&#xD;
the contrary, I believe that a gale at sea will be just&#xD;
as unwelcome a guest to all coming voyagers, as it&#xD;
was to Jason; that it will be the same trial to the&#xD;
temper of captains, the same severe test of the&#xD;
nerves and stomachs of passengers, as ever. And&#xD;
so with the fevers and pestilences of earth. What&#xD;
reasonable man believes that any resources of sci-&#xD;
ence, any energies of association, will ever be ade-&#xD;
quate to their expulsion? Not I, for one. I believe&#xD;
that Death will be setting more traps than ever for&#xD;
&#xD;
us, as the world waxes older; that there will be&#xD;
more obstinate diseases, with unpronounceable names,&#xD;
on his list, than ever; more Latin and Greek hiero-&#xD;
glyphics, round the jars of apothecaries; quite as&#xD;
many pseudo-consultations, and professional murders,&#xD;
and patients dying, while the doctors are bowing or&#xD;
squabbling outside; quite as much go~ut and rheuma-&#xD;
tism, among the buyers of Bibles and readers of&#xD;
Shakspeare, in A. ID. 10.000, as to-day. No, no;&#xD;
we shall never get the better of these monsters, or&#xD;
ferret them out of their hiding-places, or track them&#xD;
to their mysterious births, either in the loathsome&#xD;
haunts of men, or amid the rotting weeds and stag-&#xD;
nant waters of the wilderness;* but they will con-&#xD;
tinue to steal upon us, to torment and destroy us,&#xD;
and make lanes through our families, and snatch off&#xD;
our dear children by clusters. We may talk, and&#xD;
scheme, and found new systems, and erect new pro-&#xD;
fessorships, till doomsday; but as to dodging or get-&#xD;
ting round these things, who is wild enough to be-&#xD;
lieve it, any more than that we can escape from the.&#xD;
shrunk shanks, and dimmed eyes, and cracked voices&#xD;
of old age? I say again, then, and for the last time,&#xD;
I have no faith whatever in these glorious revolu-&#xD;
tions, this bright, and beautiful~ and world-wide Eden&#xD;
of yours. I believe in the old alternations of shine&#xD;
and shade; the old intermixture of frowns and&#xD;

tuted human experience; now a season of plenty,&#xD;
now of scarcity; now a period of temperance and&#xD;
prudence in our pursuits and pleasures, now of wild&#xD;
speculation and excess; and their corresponding&#xD;
fruits of bankruptcy and ruin in the business world,&#xD;
of headaches, shame, and remorse in the social. I&#xD;
believe these same ups and downs will last, while&#xD;
moons wax and wane, tides ebb and flow. I believe&#xD;
it, just as ~much ~is I do that the future occupants of&#xD;
the planet will continue to have the same average&#xD;
number of inches in their stature, and of pounds'&#xD;
Weight in their bodies, and ounces' weight in their&#xD;
brains. I do not believe that any coming generation&#xD;
will ever celebrate the solution of your perfection-&#xD;
problem, any more than that they will pick posies&#xD;
and gather peaches on the summit of Mont Blanc;&#xD;
or behold a grove of nutmeg trees rising of its own&#xD;
free will, and in~ the quincunx form, on the shores of&#xD;
Nova Zembla; or gaze delightedly on a Home Circle&#xD;
of icebergs, formed round the equator.&#xD;
A. Well, well, fray friend, notwithstanding all&#xD;
your quips and sarcasms, I am not to be frightened&#xD;
away from my faith in this same perfection; no,&#xD;
nor to be seduced from it, or lulled into inglorious re-&#xD;
pose by all the plausible sophisms (for I can't help&#xD;
calling them so), of brother C.&#xD;
G. But don't misunderstand me, my dear friend,&#xD;

&#xD;
these blessed changes, these glorious improvements,&#xD;
in our hearts and our homes, all over the earth, if I&#xD;
could see any good reason for believing them within&#xD;
our reach. But I cannot. The more I look at these&#xD;
same evils and troubles of life, which you would thus&#xD;
banish, the more clearly do I see God's hand in&#xD;
them; the more necessary do they seem to the com-&#xD;
pletion of our earthly education. But I have&#xD;
already dwelt sufficiently on this thought, and can&#xD;
only reiterate my conviction of the folly of trying to&#xD;
separate the lights and shadows about us, and to&#xD;
alter the decrees of heaven. In a word, I believe&#xD;
that the folly and wickedness of the world, are just&#xD;
as necessary to bring out and set off the splendid&#xD;
exhibitions of wisdom and goodness, for which we&#xD;
build our epics and rear our monuments, as the&#xD;
blood, and garbage, and putrid carcasses that we put&#xD;
about our draperies, are needed to impart that&#xD;
warmth and richness of soil which is to nourish our&#xD;
luscious Ilamburghs and dainty Camelias. We&#xD;
must take the two things together, just as we must&#xD;
take the reptiles and fevers of the tropics, with their&#xD;
gay plumage and brilliant flowers; and as to any&#xD;
social organization ov legislation, which is to extir-&#xD;
pate these same vices and crimes of humanity, it&#xD;
seems to me just about as visionary to expect it, as&#xD;
to expect to see any machinery of man's contriving,&#xD;
for cooling, at will,' the hot sands of the desert, or&#xD;
smoothing down the turbulent waves of ocean.&#xD;

the instantaneous extirpation of all the diseases of&#xD;
the world. I am no Socialist. I believe in home;&#xD;
in the endearments, joys, sorrows, cares, duties of&#xD;
home, as a divinely appointed institution, the place&#xD;
of which cannot be supplied, the blessed functions&#xD;
of which cannot be performed by ~ny substitute of&#xD;
man's contriving. But at the same time, my friend,&#xD;
I am for looking with '~an eye of tolerance, nay of&#xD;
encouragement, on every honest experiment for the&#xD;
amelioration of the social and moral condition of my&#xD;
brethren. I am for giving them all a fair hearing&#xD;
and trial, in this broad domain which God has en-&#xD;
trusted to us. I do not believe in any contracted&#xD;
modes of thinking, or of action, or in any spirit of&#xD;
bigotry or persecution, in a land like this. They&#xD;
have no business here; are utterly out of keeping,&#xD;
alike with our principles, and with these magnifi-&#xD;
cent estates, these world-traversing rivers and world-&#xD;
feeding allies of ours. I am for listening patiently,&#xD;
then, nay for giving the right hand of fellowship to&#xD;
every sincere reformer. Let theni all be heard.&#xD;
Let the principle of Association be fairly tested. If&#xD;
the truth be with it, let it vindicate that truth, by&#xD;
its successful action; if it be based on false views&#xD;
of human nature, let its failure fairly demonstrate&#xD;
that falsity to an impartial world. Again, I am not,&#xD;
as I just now said, the advocate of any pet law or&#xD;
series of laws, that are straightway to revolutionize&#xD;
human nature, to heal all the wounds and dry up&#xD;
&#xD;
N&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
all the sores of the body politic. I rely on no such&#xD;
quack medicines as these, ftw the blessed Cli;ltIg(s&#xD;
that I look forward to. No, no ; but on the sl~~v,&#xD;
toilsome, patient, faithful, but in the end triumphant,&#xD;
world-including march of mind; on the gradually&#xD;
enlarged circuit of the schoolmaster, the gradually&#xD;
expanded and amended course of lessons that he is&#xD;
to teach; till at last, the whole family of man is em-&#xD;
braced in his ministrations, and the minds and hearts&#xD;
of all are fairly developed, under his instructions.&#xD;
This is the perfection that I dream of (if you will), and&#xD;
this the road to it; a perfection, too, which does not, as&#xD;
brother B. also seemed to take for granted, imply&#xD;
any necessary equality of all intellects or conditions,&#xD;
or equal aptitude of each man for all employment,&#xD;
any more than it does an equal fertility in all the&#xD;
soils, or an equally genial character in all the cli-&#xD;
mates of earth; but which does imply equal rights,&#xD;
the recognition of every man as a brother, the world-&#xD;
wide reign of peace and good-will, the extirpation of&#xD;
idleness, poverty, disease, vice, and crime; which&#xD;
does imply the bringing about of improvements, phy-&#xD;
sical, moral, and intellectual, which so far from being&#xD;
measured by, can be but feebly apprehended, from&#xD;
any ~hin~ that has hitherto been realized on earth;&#xD;
scientific discoveries, triumphs of art, varied forms of&#xD;
industry, and manifestations of beauty, compared&#xD;
with which, all our doings, hitherto, are little more&#xD;
than chills play: a state of things, wherein preven-&#xD;

was before held noxious, latent virtues and uses dis..&#xD;
covered in all that was before thought worthless, and&#xD;
the wisdom and goodness of the great Designer, more&#xD;
and more completely manifested, in the more and&#xD;
more thorough~ exploration and comprehension of his&#xD;
wotks ; a state of things,' wherein violent and un-&#xD;
timely deaths will no longer be known, but every&#xD;
departure be a gentle dismissal from a scene of faith-&#xD;
fully completed labors, and innocent enjoyments, a&#xD;
gentle introduction to new spheres of action. This,&#xD;
my friend, is the perfection which I believe God has&#xD;
in store for his children. Far, far off; indeed, the&#xD;
consummation; .but none 'the less certain-is it, that&#xD;
the first steps of the progress thereunto, have been'&#xD;
taken, and that its course is ever onward. Yes, this .&#xD;
imy dream, which I am unwillingtsurnetil&#xD;
less exchange for that perpetual succession of nuis.-&#xD;
ances, follies, troubles, on which brother B. seems to&#xD;
take such a perverse pleasure in dwelling;' that&#xD;
ceaseless conflict of good and evil, which you so in-&#xD;
sist upon, as indispensable to the true discipline and&#xD;
~relish of life. I see not the' necessity of that conl-&#xD;
flict ; on the contrary, I believe that in the universal&#xD;
diffusion of peace and innocence, there would be far&#xD;
more significance and charm in existence, than ever ;&#xD;
far more employment for the goodness of a Howard&#xD;
or a Fenelon, for the genius of a Raphael or a&#xD;
Shakspeare. I have already, in a brief, glancing&#xD;

way, undertaken to make out, in reply to friend B.)&#xD;
a veritable, progress, thus far ; to show, (and how&#xD;
any reasonable man should~ deny such a proposition,&#xD;
,is to me most strange,) the existence of all manner&#xD;
of inventions and improvements about us, that the&#xD;
world never knew, till now, and that would fill our&#xD;
brethren of the patriarchal ages, with wonder aptd&#xD;
delight, were they here to-day, to behold them. I&#xD;
shall not trouble you with'any'more illustrations on&#xD;
that point ; but, with your leave, I will venture, with&#xD;
all due sense of my incompetency to the task, to sha-&#xD;
dow forth some few of those good things, that I be-&#xD;
lieve the future is to reveal; and will endeavor not&#xD;
unreasonably to tax your patience, in so doing.&#xD;
C. Well, my friend, I shall listen with pleasure.&#xD;
As I said. before, this same perfection of yours seems&#xD;
to me the veriest dream of enthusiasm ; a consum-&#xD;
mation, that no sun will ever rise upon. None~ the&#xD;
less, however, do I respect the earnestness and&#xD;
heartiness of your faitlz. Take us, then, with you,&#xD;
(our sarcastic, incredulous brother here, and myself,)&#xD;
and let us see some of the bowers and walks of this&#xD;
.Paradise of yours, and of these pleasant things that&#xD;
are so to enliven and bless it.&#xD;
A. Briefly then, and ivith all due modesty, to my&#xD;
task. Far indeed be it from me to presume to- por-&#xD;

two prominent points, if you please, and look about&#xD;
us, for a moment. And first, what sort of a specta-.&#xD;

as we approach it ! What comely dwellings, what&#xD;
spacious, well-kept -streets, what clusters of bright&#xD;
handsome, courteous citizens ! What clear, ringing&#xD;
voices, what pleasant salutations ! What order and&#xD;
decorum everywhere prevail! No sots or paupers,&#xD;
or pickpockets, or harlots, or cripples -deface the&#xD;
scene ; no turbulenahackmen or insolent policemen,&#xD;
no haggard victims of business, hurrying down to&#xD;
their speculations, no martyrs to idleness lounging&#xD;
listlessly along ; but a pleasant stir, a gay, sprightly&#xD;
movement, everywhere diffused, proclaims the reign&#xD;
of health and temperance alike in tasks 'and pleas--&#xD;
ures, and of the light hearts and pleasant fancies,&#xD;
that follow in their train. -What splendid shops,&#xD;
too, are here, filled with fabrics from all corners of&#xD;
the earth ! What magnificent 'porticoes greet the&#xD;
eye in, all directions, and gymnasiums,- and baths,&#xD;

CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.&#xD;

and fountains, and conservatories, and markets of&#xD;

ed with all manner of good things ! What a charm-&#xD;
ing; intermixture, everywhere, of stately mansions,&#xD;
and temples dedicated to Faith, Art, and Science ;&#xD;
every science having its own hallowed .pile,- every&#xD;
art its own special theatre for the display of its tri-&#xD;
umphs. Such churches, too ! As magnificent in&#xD;
their architecture and adornments as their rites are&#xD;
simple and solemn. No multiplicity of sects here be-&#xD;
wilders the worshipper, no-jargon and falsehoods of.&#xD;
priestcraft, no vile confessionals, no monstrous nunner-&#xD;
ies,no dry and pedantic display of scholastic subtleties&#xD;
deface these services. One blessed creed alone pre-&#xD;
vails throughout the' earth, and there are but two&#xD;
articles in it ; -Christ's precious commandments, love&#xD;
to God and love to our brethren. These alone are&#xD;
the themes of the preacher, the Creator's goodness&#xD;
as everywhere displayed in his works and ways,&#xD;
man's goodness and happiness, as he humbly imitates&#xD;
the great Master ! And how admirably do the brief,&#xD;
but beautiful prayers, and the swelling anthems re-&#xD;
spondi to them ! What groups of school-houses too,&#xD;
and colleges are here, with their pleasant walks, and&#xD;
gardens and play-grounds ! What companies of&#xD;
beautiful, and ingenuous youths, are they sending&#xD;
forth continually, no longer to contend with a harsh&#xD;
and perilous world, but to apply, with generous emu-&#xD;
lation, and prompt success, the lessons learned. in&#xD;

them, to the infinitely varied, 'and ever instructive&#xD;

their recreations; but mutual esteem, and regard&#xD;
everywhere prevailing between husbands and wives,&#xD;

crowjied too, with all, the statues of the great philos-&#xD;

What a pile'! What ~magnificent apparatus and in-&#xD;
struments! What precious discoveries have they&#xD;
made, are they continually making, in the great dcep&#xD;

of air! What would a Galileo or a Herschel have&#xD;
said to such soundings as these? See too, the su-&#xD;

Here are no records of fraud, of horrible casualties,&#xD;
of hearts broken by neglect, or base ingratitude;&#xD;
all is glad tidings and gentle messages. And so, in&#xD;
that other priiicely pile, whose sculptured entabla-&#xD;

too~ are no unwise tariffs, no fraudulent valuations,&#xD;
no vile tricks of trade to deal with; but equity, in-&#xD;
telligence, courtesy, and promptness preside over its&#xD;
portals, pervade its manifold chambers. See the&#xD;
warehouses too, of the merchants; how commodious,&#xD;
how capacious, how filled with all manner of contriv-&#xD;

What massive, what magnificent quays are here!&#xD;
Dotted too, with the bronze and marble images of the&#xD;
great navigators and discoverers of earth. No vaga-&#xD;

become of the NqXional Debt, the Income and other&#xD;
taxes, the descendants of. Her Majesty, the pe~rs&#xD;
temporal and spiritual, the overgrown estates, mo-&#xD;

A. Gone, gone, gone, my friend, all of them; not&#xD;
put oust of the way, however, by fraud or violence;&#xD;
no, no; but they h~ve slowly and gently melted&#xD;
away, under the light and warmth of the blessed&#xD;
day of equality and brotherhood; they, an~l the vast&#xD;
domains and piles that were devoted to them.-&#xD;
Crowns, and coronets, and armorial bearings, have&#xD;
4'long since lost their lustre and significance; while&#xD;
centuries of peace and prudence have cancelled the&#xD;
debts, and annulled the taxes that the wars and fol-&#xD;
lies of old brought with them. And their substi-&#xD;
tutes are these same happy'homes, these everywhere&#xD;
multiplied and circulated comforts that we see&#xD;
around us. Think not, howe~er~ that the picture&#xD;
suffers any. even in the artist's eyes, in consequence.&#xD;
We miss, indeed, a few stray palaces and stately&#xD;
hospitals, a few pompous parades and military fune-&#xD;
rals; but we have, instead, the splendid processions&#xD;
of peace and infinitely varied industry, the number-&#xD;

less ddmes that Freedom everywhere rears to Faith&#xD;
and Knowledge. I must not linger over them, how-&#xD;
ever. Let us go, if you will, and look foi' another&#xD;
brief moment upon old Rome. We can but throw a&#xD;
passing glance at the smiling fields and gardens of&#xD;
lovely France, with their ten thousand improve-&#xD;
ments in drainage, tillage, and culture; or a~ the&#xD;
stately bi~idges that cross her streams, her bea~iful&#xD;
system of telegraphs, her railways radiating ~n all&#xD;
directions, each set in flowers, and bordered by su-&#xD;
perb trees; or at the cities that dot her surface, so&#xD;
admirably built, paved, cleaned, lighted, ventilated;&#xD;
or at the innumerable new employment 'and com-&#xD;
forts that science has found, for the dwellers among&#xD;
the Alps. Here we are, at the gates of the impe-&#xD;
rial city. No traces, though, do we see of imperial&#xD;
or jxipal tyranny, but the same blessed transmuta-&#xD;
tions as before. No lounging soldiers, or mutilated&#xD;
beggars, or crumbling towers disfigure the picture,&#xD;
but peace, plenty,, industry, everywhere enliven it.&#xD;
The Campagna is~ covered again with farms and vil-&#xD;
las, never, more to return to desolation. The Pala-&#xD;
tine is again crowned with stately; buildings; not&#xD;
the scenes, though, of royal riot and brutal debauch-&#xD;
cry, but dedicated to science. Here are vast libra-&#xD;

not the original stones, indeed ; they long since&#xD;
crumbled into dust; but they have carefully pre-&#xD;
served the aspect that it wore, with its broken arches,&#xD;
and vacant arena, in the 19th century of Christ;*&#xD;
that it might -remain, a lasting memento of the&#xD;
crimes of old, might sound its solemn warning to&#xD;
humanity, through all time. There is another Co-&#xD;
losseum, hard by ; even more vast and beautiful;.&#xD;
but oh, how different the entertainments presented&#xD;
in it! Here grand conferences are held, of the wise&#xD;
and learned of all lands.; magnificent flower-shows ;&#xD;
beautiful scientific experiments ; here concerts are&#xD;
given, with music such as was never before heard on&#xD;
earth. What hymns, what choruses are here, and&#xD;
grand and infinitely varied orchestral effects ! Think&#xD;
of all these things. and then of the harsh clangor of&#xD;
the trumpets, the mad conflicts of wild beasts and&#xD;
wilder men, that disgraced and made terrible the&#xD;

and its superb pageants, and, the palace hard by,&#xD;
with-its manifold treasurers; have they all perished,&#xD;
are they all forgotten, in tliese golden days-of yours'.?&#xD;
A. The originals, of course, were dust, ages ago.&#xD;
But think you, the world would have let such pre-&#xD;
cious thoughts and images perish ? No, no ; careful&#xD;
. copies have been made from time to time, of all these&#xD;

blessed story of the Transfiguration ; the School of&#xD;
Athens still holds its scattered groups of philoso-.&#xD;
.phers ; all the old forms of Greece and Rome are&#xD;
here, in undimmed beauty and majesty. But where&#xD;
stood the old church itself, is now a pile far more&#xD;
grand and beautiful, more rich in monuments ; and&#xD;
what is more, they were not so many years in build-&#xD;
ing it, as they were centuries in putting up the other.&#xD;
Contributions flowed freely in, from all lands,,and in&#xD;
one little week, the sum required was raised. Not&#xD;
a dollar, stained with fraud, or extorted from super-&#xD;
stitious fear, was expended upon it. Well-paid, and&#xD;
worthy, were the laborers who reared its walls ; and&#xD;
the rites that are celebrated in it, how do they con-&#xD;
trast,'in their sublime purity and simplicity, with the&#xD;
mummeries and absurdities that so marred the beauty&#xD;
of that famous one of old ! And so throughout the&#xD;
happy city ; peace, freedom, brotherhood ; every&#xD;
street bears witness to them ; they beam forth -from&#xD;
every countenance. Naples, too, has the same plea-&#xD;

of devils, that some old cynic once called her ; but, in&#xD;
her loveliness and goodness, perfectly according with&#xD;
the exquisite scenery around her ; long since extinct,&#xD;
those crimes, vices, diseses, that gave her such a "bad&#xD;
eminence," in the annals of the past ; long since&#xD;
vanished, those turbulent, half-savage lazzaroni of&#xD;

must not trespass on your patience, my friends.&#xD;
Else might we linger over restored Thebes, rebuilt&#xD;
Athens, all Greece, revived, free, happy; over Tur-&#xD;
key, redeemed for ever fNom despotism and supersti-&#xD;
tion, and the magnificent Constantinople of these&#xD;
days. One little glance at Egypt, and 'old father&#xD;
Nile, and I have done. Glorious revolution, indeed,&#xD;
in man' aaid nature! Smiling fields an~l shining cit-&#xD;
ies everywhere greet the eye; innumerable struc~&#xD;
tures and devices, too, for controlling and for circu.-&#xD;
lating the precious waters of the river, through all&#xD;
the veins and alleys of the land; canals, aqueducts,&#xD;
and reservoirs, exquisite machinery for draining and&#xD;
for irrigating the~ lands, to which the contrivances&#xD;
of old, even of renowned Holland herself, seem. the&#xD;
veriest toys. What factories, tod, where innocent,&#xD;
happy labor plies its pleasant tasks, in airy, well-&#xD;
lighted' chambers; what academies, filled with&#xD;
bright-eyed scholars! Ah, here are the famous old&#xD;
quarries; but to what different uses are they put!&#xD;
No more gloomy sphinxes or monster deities are&#xD;
carved out of them, or long lines of dismal pyra-&#xD;
mids, or temples dedicated to hideous rites, and vile'&#xD;
beast-~yorship. Oh, no; but Christian churches,&#xD;
halls of legislation, observatories, yiaducts, statue-&#xD;
crowned bridges, forms of the wise and good of all&#xD;
ages. But listen to the sweet chimes from yon tow-&#xD;
er. Strange music this, is it not, for grim old&#xD;
Egypt? Let us venture forth, a moment, on the&#xD;
&#xD;
Lybian Desert, nay, on the great Sahara itself.&#xD;
What do we behold? It is not, indeed, quite yet&#xD;
given over to Socialism, as brother B. seemed to ap-&#xD;
prehend; a mere orchard, dotted with phalanste-&#xD;
ries; but there are 'glorious changes in it, neverthe-&#xD;
less; improvements quite practicable in this period&#xD;
of universal loc6motion; of rapid, constant inter-&#xD;
change of thoughts and products, between all lands.&#xD;
There are orchards here in abundance, and thriving&#xD;
towns and villages, and intersecting rail-roads, and&#xD;
all the evidences of high culture. Cam this be&#xD;
Africa, my friends; the Africa that old' records tell&#xD;
of; that accursed, desolate land, with its unexplored&#xD;
rivers and wildernesses, its burning heats, fevers,&#xD;
reptiles, savage menand beats, its murderous feuds?&#xD;
Is this fair coast, studded with cities, alive with&#xD;
commerce, the scene of that infamous traffic in hu-&#xD;
man flesh, that staineil the annals of past ages?&#xD;
lEven so~ After long centuries 'of toil and struggle,&#xD;
Faith and Science have won these glorious victories,&#xD;
at last; have righted all these wrongs, extirpated all&#xD;
these vile passions, drained all these marshes, rooted&#xD;
out these treacherous beasts and lurking fevers; Art&#xD;
has fouud out many precious secrets, in the way of&#xD;
planting and building; has contrived many cunning&#xD;
modes of. cooling these hot airs, and of rendering&#xD;
these regions, not merely tolerable, but, as we see,&#xD;
the fIst abodes of all those comforts, refinements, em-&#xD;

opmcnts, that the philosophers of old times fondly&#xD;
imagined were confined to certain favored zones of&#xD;
earth. But you ~mile incredulously, my friend.&#xD;
You have evidently no 'faith in this same brilliant&#xD;
future of mine, and so I will dwell no longer upon it.&#xD;
0. 1 have not, indeed. As I said before, I re-&#xD;
spect most sincerely, this hearty, enthusiastic nature&#xD;
of yours; I listen with pleasure to your glowing de-&#xD;
scriptions. Nor can I I~elp wishing, at times, that&#xD;
all these good things were in store for us, and that&#xD;
men were destined to' become the terrestrial angels&#xD;
that you paint themb But no, no, it may not be. God&#xD;
hath decreed it otherwise. The ~me old obstacles&#xD;
and objections, that I have already glanced at, still&#xD;
stare me in the face, as pertinaciously as ever, not-&#xD;
withstanding this bright, vivid picture of yours.&#xD;
A dream, my friend, a very dream! I say again;&#xD;
the whole machinery of life, as I understand it, is&#xD;
based upon these very evils and infirmities, that you&#xD;
have so carefully excluded from your 'sketch; and&#xD;
this pseudo-perfection 'yoif so insist upon, is but an-&#xD;
other name for destruction. Is it necessary to illus-&#xD;
trate a 'point so clear as this? Can you help seeing,&#xD;
my dear friend, that you have been pulling to pieces,&#xD;
all this while, far more than you have been creating;&#xD;
impeding the very march of mind that. you so seek&#xD;
to urge forward;. narrowing the circuit, alike of the&#xD;
schoolmaster and the merchant.; virtually shutting&#xD;
up three quarters of the shops of these same vision-&#xD;
&#xD;
225&#xD;
&#xD;
ary cities,' that you have just been showing us?&#xD;
Pretty progress, truly, that annihilates, at one fell&#xD;
swoop, all the armies and navies of the world, and&#xD;
the vast and manifold industry, dependent on them;&#xD;
that cuts off all the fees of its judges and lawyers;&#xD;
that' puts an end to the visits of its doctors; blots&#xD;
out the shining lights of its apothecaries; seriously&#xD;
injures, if it does not destroy, all those crafts, that&#xD;
live by ministering unto the elegant desires and&#xD;
caprices of men; worse still, that takes away. from&#xD;
the priest, the best half of his mission, and from&#xD;
love, the most sacred part of its ministrations, that~&#xD;
of reclaiming the erring; and binding up the wounds&#xD;
of the broken-hearted; that robs the artist, in every&#xD;
walk of art, of so many sources of inspiration; that&#xD;
deprives us all of so much innocent fun, too,~ in re-&#xD;
moving all those little absurdities and contre-temps,&#xD;
with which it deals. Are not these, my friePd, the&#xD;
inevitable accompaniments of this insane attempt&#xD;
(pardon the epithet) to revolutionize human nature?&#xD;
If indeed, you can find adequate employment and&#xD;
appropriate excitements, for all these good people,&#xD;
whose callings you have thus rendered null, and&#xD;
whom you have turned adrift upon the world, in this&#xD;
wholesale and summary fashion, then will I acknow-&#xD;
ledge the injustice of my criticisms, and become a&#xD;
convert to your doctrine. Meanwhile I must con-&#xD;
tinue to call it the veriest dream of the enthusiast.&#xD;

some force in these objections of yours ; but don't&#xD;
misrepresent me. I have not looked forwai4 to any&#xD;
such violent and rapid revolution in the hearts and&#xD;
affairs of men, as you speak of. I have taken no&#xD;
such ground. No, no; long, long ages of toil, ex-&#xD;
periments, struggles,)I know, must be gone through,&#xD;
before this blessed victory is won; a host of preju-&#xD;
dices and passions must be grappled with; ten thou-&#xD;
sand practical difficulties, such as you suggest, must&#xD;
be met and overcome first many parts must be&#xD;
dropped from the great drama of life, many new&#xD;
ones introduced, before this vision of mine can be&#xD;
realized. I am. not blind to, still less do I presume&#xD;
to solve these puzzling problems. All I say is, that&#xD;
II believe time will bring t1~e solution of them all, at&#xD;
last; will demonstrate the practicability of all these&#xD;
improvements; will yet show ~o future ages, an&#xD;
earth all alive with innocent ~/id happy workers.&#xD;
Such is my faith in human nature; in the capacities&#xD;
and dispositions which God has given man, and in&#xD;
the materials with which he has surrounded him.&#xD;
Yes, I believe that the* gradual diffusion of the&#xD;
sublime doctrines of Christ, and the sublime truths&#xD;
of science, will achieve all these wonders ; will&#xD;
finally gain the day, everywhere, over the ignorance,&#xD;
indolence, sensuality of men, will wake us all up, at&#xD;
last, yes, the whole brotherhood, from pole to pole,&#xD;
to a true sense of our position, and of the lofty tasks&#xD;
set before us. Slowly indeed, but surely, will all&#xD;

these bad passior~s, and brutal appetites, be subju-&#xD;

by love, over the hearts of its brethren; inte mper-&#xD;
ance will be redeemed from its vile thraldom; false&#xD;
pride will no longer turn its back on proffered kind-&#xD;

dices of men, with the feuds and wars that grow out&#xD;
of them, yes, all the blunders and wickedness of the&#xD;
world, in God's good time, be banished, and thus will&#xD;
all these puzzles, social, political, moral, that now so&#xD;
embarrass and annoy us, be cleared up, in that day&#xD;
of world-wide wisdom and good-will. These evils are&#xD;
not to afflict earth forever.; they are not an indis-&#xD;
pensable part of the machinery of life. The world&#xD;
will be worth livin~ in, my friend~ when they are&#xD;
gone, Will have plenty of good work and play in it,&#xD;
for all, and pleasant excitements of all sorts. Our&#xD;
affections will not droop and languish, because the&#xD;
objects of them will J~e all bright, and gentle, and&#xD;
beautiful ; our intellects will not flag, because they&#xD;
are not stimulated continually, by the moral and&#xD;
physical infirmities of our brethren. Oh, no; on the&#xD;
contrary, there will be far more to keep both heads&#xD;
and heart~ in healthful action, than ever; a thousand&#xD;

pared with those realities that I verily believe God&#xD;
hath in store for earth. Such a thought as this,&#xD;
my friend, is it not far more inspiring than the. one&#xD;

and never-ending jars of good and evil? So it&#xD;
seems to me, and as such, I must continue to cher-&#xD;

-which you advocate your doctrine. At the sae&#xD;
time, I must say, I do not see the force of your ar-&#xD;
gumients. You have not shown, at all to my satis-&#xD;
faction, the ways ai ens by which this paradise&#xD;
of yours is to be attained. You express, generally,&#xD;
great faith in human nature, and the wonders which&#xD;
religion and knowledge are finally to work in it ;&#xD;
and you infer, as a matter of course, corresponding&#xD;
wonders in the outer world ; but you do inot describe&#xD;
the processes by which they are to, brought about.&#xD;
You do not tell us what these -new and delightful&#xD;
parts in the great drama are, that are to take the&#xD;
place of the old and bad ones ; or how the happy .&#xD;
crowds of these ideal cities of yours are to be sus-&#xD;
tained, or all these brilliant shops supported. You&#xD;
indulge freely in vague and glowing generalities, but&#xD;
you carefully shun the statistical and practical ques-&#xD;
tions involved-in so stupendous a revolution. You&#xD;
insist upon it, and with characteristic earnestness,&#xD;
that that revolution must and will come ; that these&#xD;
bad passions &amp;amp;f ours must give way, at last, before&#xD;
the power of Faith and Truth ; and that when this&#xD;
is done, then. all these embarrassing and exciting&#xD;
problems,--that noiw disturb society, will be happily&#xD;
solved. You then paint a glowing picture, as be-&#xD;
fore, of the blessed results of such solution. This&#xD;
is all very well ; but I confess, I should like to. see&#xD;
a little more of the machiery that is to work these&#xD;
wonders, should like to have something a little more&#xD;

definite and explicit, than these picturesque fancy-&#xD;
flights of yours, before 1I become a believer in them.&#xD;
-A. Well, I can only say again, in reply, that the&#xD;
machinery seems to me simple enough ; the same ma-&#xD;
chinery that has worked the wonders we witness to-&#xD;
day; the gradual diffusion of moral and scientific&#xD;
truth. As to going into the particulars you call for,&#xD;
I. certainly shall not be so presumptuous as -to at-&#xD;
tempt it. Who, indee, shall dare to -recast this&#xD;
g reat drama, to foretell the innumerable revelations&#xD;
of science and creations of art that are in store for&#xD;
us, or the new callings they are to give birth to, or&#xD;
the ameliorations and improvements they are to&#xD;
cause in the old ones ? Who shA 1 presume to antib&#xD;
cipate the solution of all these problems, moral, phi-&#xD;
losophical, economical, that. are involved in .the&#xD;
bringing about of these glorious changes ? That&#xD;
the world will meet, face, overcome them all in time,&#xD;
however, I doubt it -not. My position,. my dear&#xD;
friend, is simply this (and it seems to me a perfectly&#xD;
reasonable one); I look around me, and see the won-&#xD;
ders already achieved by Faith and Knowledge,&#xD;
alike in the hearts andl institutions of men, and in&#xD;
the face of nature, and I can't help feeling that they&#xD;
will go on achieving them unto the end ; in the same&#xD;
slow and toilsome, but certain and triumphant way ;&#xD;
till 'the generation will come at last, that shall see&#xD;
and enjoy, as a blessed reality, that very consumuma-&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
tion that I have so feebly and unworthily shadowed&#xD;
forth.&#xD;
G. Never, never. Excuse me, my dear friend,&#xD;
for saying so; but it seems to me that you are so&#xD;
carried away by the generous enthusiasm of your&#xD;
nature, so fascinated by this brilliant fancy sketch&#xD;
of yours, that you cannot, will not, see the innumner-&#xD;
able, insuperable obstacles that must- ever prevent&#xD;
us from realizing it.&#xD;
A. And you, my friend, may you not be so per-&#xD;
versely attached to things as they are, that you can&#xD;
neither appreciate aright the improvements that ac-&#xD;
tually exist around us, nor see the practicability of&#xD;
future ones ?&#xD;
C. Too much so, certainly. Yes, I acknowledge&#xD;
that the Conservative element is quite too. much in&#xD;
preponderance in my composition, and I think the&#xD;
Progressive equally in excess in yours. We shall&#xD;
never agree on this point, I fear ; nor would I need-&#xD;
lessly prolong the discussion. I have no such faith&#xD;
in human nature, myself; as you profess, nor in the*&#xD;
future. I do not believe that religion and knowledge,&#xD;
however attractively presented, eloquently expound-&#xD;
ed, widely circulated they may be, are to work any&#xD;
such miracles as you describe. It is not in us, it is&#xD;
not in earth, to bring about such stupendous chan-&#xD;
ges. As brother 11. said, there is neither faith nor&#xD;
courage enough in the moral, materials nor sunshine&#xD;
~Nnough in the natural world, therefor. No, no;&#xD;

these visionary cathedrals of yours; my friend, with&#xD;
their pure and simple rites, will never be reared,&#xD;
save in the dreams of poets ; nor those post-offices,&#xD;
whose mail-bags are crowded with glad tidings only.&#xD;
We cannot thus revolutionize either the hearts,'oi'&#xD;
thie letters of the world ; but they' will ever contain,&#xD;
as now, the same, strange medley of good -and evil&#xD;
propensities, in the one, of. ups and downs, sudden&#xD;
revulsions and wind-falls, wise and simple criticisms,&#xD;
gracious and ungracious messages, in the other. Oh,&#xD;
no ; we may not thus sever the thorns and roses of&#xD;
life; keep thus the innocent flower, and not the ser-&#xD;
pent under it ; thus take away alike the pangs of&#xD;
parting lovers, and the raptures of their meeting,&#xD;
by putting them in a woi-ld all sunshine and con-&#xD;
stancy ; thus separate the mother's love from the&#xD;
mother's care and an hish, or the triumphs of gen-&#xD;
ius from its toils, and tears, and heartaches. Nor&#xD;
is it given us to work corresponding changes in the&#xD;

tirpate all the vile and desolate spots of earth, light&#xD;
up all its caverns, tame its angry seas and whirl-.&#xD;
pools, turn all its howling wildernesses into gardens.&#xD;
To expept any such revolutions as these, either in&#xD;
the moral or physical world, seems to me most vain&#xD;

C. Certainly not, so far as the conversion of&#xD;
earth into heaven is- concerned. If I understand&#xD;
aright Christ's mission, he came for no such purpose,&#xD;
predicted no such result. On the contrary, while he&#xD;
sends forth his disciples, to spread the gospel abroad&#xD;
in all lands, does he not tell them, at the same time,&#xD;
that but few will listen to their teachings or apply&#xD;
them to the business of life ; that these very evils,&#xD;
which you would banish from the world, are there-&#xD;
fore, a permanent part of the divine arrangements,&#xD;
and his religion, in consequence, a -permanent re-&#xD;

Scripture, or history, or my own daily observation&#xD;

in us, or about us, the wherewithal to achieve any&#xD;

cating deaf mutes, and treating lunatics like human&#xD;

were scouted at, as the dreams of just such vision-&#xD;

world far more crowded to-day than ever, with ob-&#xD;
jects of interest and productions of genius;- with&#xD;
good poetry, science, art, innocent amusements of&#xD;
al sorts, to excite and instruct us, and wean us from&#xD;
'low tastes and brutal appetites ? The press, what&#xD;
wonders is it working continually! When ever be-&#xD;
fore, were the printer, artist, engraver, laboring to-&#xD;
gethier to such* purpose, and' for such a circle of&#xD;
readers and students ? Cheap books, arid' lectures,&#xD;
and illustrated newspapers, are they not lit rally&#xD;
searching the earth, penetrating to the remotest&#xD;
streams, invading its most distant islands ? Tell&#xD;
me not that all these agencies have no glorious con-&#xD;
summation to achieve ; still less, that when they&#xD;
have achieved it, the scene then presented will be&#xD;
less stimulating and desirable for men, than the im-&#xD;
perfectly developed one about us. I cannot assent&#xD;
to any such notion. Tell me not that a worl4 thus&#xD;
explored, purified, embellished, will not be a thou-&#xD;
sand fold more attractive than ever; that God's&#xD;
book of nature, when thus read. and expounded&#xD;
everywhere, by bright-eyed, innocent, intelligent&#xD;
readers, will not have far more glorious mearnings in&#xD;
it, than the feeble vision,, and half-finished tasks of&#xD;
to-day, can give us. To talk thus, and to insist thus,&#xD;
on keeping the world as it is, in preference to the&#xD;
magnificent~ world that the future has in store, seems-&#xD;
to rme just about as unreasonable, as it would be to&#xD;

ourselves may not yet, in God's good time, be the&#xD;

sooner would I believe this, than cherish the gloomy&#xD;
and incredulous spirit of our brother. here; but as&#xD;
usual, my friend, in this fanciful picture of .yours,&#xD;
youi seem most carefully to exclude all the terrors,&#xD;
while you expatiate on the splendors of the future-.&#xD;
Pray, what right have you to infer, as you do, this&#xD;
final and universal victory of good over evil, to turn&#xD;
all these stars about us into palaces. of light, these&#xD;
fiends into angels, nay, to transform Beelzebub him--&#xD;
self, into a loyal, obedient son of God ? What war-&#xD;
rant hiave you for all this ? I find no such expecta-&#xD;
tions held forth in my Biblei. I hear .no such doc-&#xD;
trine from Christ's lips. On the contrary, he tells&#xD;
me of lost souls, and of regions set apart for endless&#xD;
sufferings ; 'of progress unto perfection in evil as&#xD;
well as good. He paints no such brilliant and fanci-&#xD;
ful universe as yours ; promises no such all-pervad-&#xD;
ing love End light; but preaches of horrors as well as&#xD;
joys ineffable, of desolate, accursed realms, where no&#xD;
cheerful ray, no happy. thought ever enters. How&#xD;
can you reconcile these things, my friend ? How can&#xD;
you escape the imputation of heresy, in setting forth&#xD;
such notions as yours ?&#xD;
A. Well, if it be -heresy, to receive with reluc-&#xD;
tance the doctrine of eternal punishments, I. must&#xD;
plead guilty to the charge. I know the difficulties&#xD;
of-the case, my friend. There are texts, certainly,&#xD;
that seem to proclaim that doctrine, with terrible&#xD;
clearness ; but I confess, I gladly run away from&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
252&#xD;

i&#xD;
&#xD;
them, and take refuge in others, that speak'a lan-&#xD;
guage far more comfortable and encouraging, and&#xD;
far more in accordance, as it appears to me, both&#xD;
with the Creator's omnipotence and goodness. No,&#xD;
nio; I cannot believe that. God has doomed any&#xD;
creature of his, in any part of his dominions, to end-&#xD;
less misery. That every sin must have its attend-&#xD;
ant sorrow ; that the. penalty of every transgres-&#xD;
sion must be paid to the full - that no sophistry or*&#xD;
ingenuity can evade that payment ; that guilt pnd&#xD;
wretchedness still, abound on -earth, and in other&#xD;
worlds, and that they will long continue to impair&#xD;
their beauty and happiness, all these things who&#xD;
will presume to question ? -But. that this sad'# his-&#xD;
tory is to remain so forever,.or that any star in sthe&#xD;
universe is destined to be the theatre of eternal suf-&#xD;
fering, or that any being exists in any part of it, so&#xD;
steeped in guilt and anguish (no, not Satan himself),&#xD;
as to be beyond the redeeming love or healing power&#xD;
of the Creator, I no more believe it than I do that&#xD;
there is any intellect that can baffle God's wisdom,&#xD;
or any force that can resist his supremacy. .Oh,&#xD;
no; on the contrary, I believe that in this mysteri-&#xD;
ous, but divinely ordained conflict of good and evil,&#xD;
the powers of light are, everywhere, slowly but&#xD;
surely gaining the ascendancy over the powers of&#xD;
darkness, and that it will continue to be so, even&#xD;
unto the perfect day; yes, that perfect day, wherein&#xD;

If, with all the nameless species of books e&#xD;
to write one sui generis, the author of Fun&#xD;
fairly in the race for popularity. He is jude]&#xD;

the world unborn; but here we have the forms of things unseen&#xD;
bodied forth with so familiar an air, that we half believe the -divi-&#xD;
miation already verified. Here and therg dash of wilful extrava-&#xD;
gance, so far from correcting the illusion, only sets us to thinking&#xD;
that all things short of tunneling the globe, or building a bridge&#xD;
to the moon, will be possible to the science and art of future ages.&#xD;
Another part of Fun and Earnest is entitled "C Extracts from the&#xD;
Epistles of Whimsiculo the Elder,"-the themes and drift of&#xD;
which are quite too various for our present notation. All prove&#xD;
the writer, however quaintly he may dress his ideas, to be a clear&#xD;
and close observer and thinker.&#xD;
The author, in this and his preceding essays; gives ample evi-.&#xD;
dence of I'aculties which we should wish to see exercised in some&#xD;
systematic production-something, the form as well 'as the&#xD;
substance of which would be memorable. He clearly belongs to&#xD;
the new order of mental workers, who have, no notion of pulling&#xD;
in the traces with old school plodders, or being hitched to the&#xD;
common .vehicles of sentiment, satire, or philosophy. The fun of&#xD;
Fun and Earnest is but the light, bright froth, capping~ a well-.&#xD;
brewed and wholesome beverage. The earnest of it we- accept,;&#xD;

&#xD;
FUN AND EARNEsT. -By the Author of Musings of an Invalid,&#xD;
Fancies of a W~himsical Man, &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
This is the third of a series of very peculiar books, the prede-&#xD;
cessors of which we have already noticed favorably. The author,&#xD;
a humorist and'a scholar, evidently mixing little with the world&#xD;
he observes, has yet the keenest sympathy with the life of -the&#xD;
times, the nicest observation f all the tendencies Qf-society, but&#xD;
with an irresistible proclivity to measure them all by the foregone&#xD;
history of our kind, and the universal laws of our nature. An&#xD;
ingrained moralist and natural preacher, he tries to hide his wig&#xD;
&#xD;
and bands, his table of commandments and moral philosophy,&#xD;
under the robe of a harlequin, or the mask of a mummer. No-&#xD;
thing would frighten him so much as to be suspected of a wish to&#xD;
teach, and yet he is as busy as a Yankee schoolmaster with his&#xD;
lessons ; nothing disgusts him more than a charge of sanctimoni-&#xD;
ousness, while it takes all his wildest pranks and funniest grima-&#xD;
ces, to-hide his sober and chastening lineaments. We have read&#xD;
-his three books-the very titles of which oil the risibles for im-&#xD;
mediate use, and which are full of extravaganza,'wit, satire, fun&#xD;
-without one hearty laugh, nay, with as serious a heart as we&#xD;
read many of the best chapters in D~on Quixote, or the queerest&#xD;
papers in Elia-with such a sense of the deep earnest, the sad or&#xD;
bitter truth under the jokes, that. the medicine outsavors the&#xD;
syrup, and compels our thoughtfulness instead of moving our&#xD;
mirth. When we see what a burden of weighty thought and&#xD;
feeling the author carries, we cannot help wishing that the rich&#xD;
scholarship, cunning Wit, and felicitous phraseology he possesses&#xD;
Were employed in a more direct manner, to Adorn and point and&#xD;
urge his wisdom.&#xD;
*  Fun and Earnest is own brother to the two preceding volumes,&#xD;
but we confess we like him better than the other members of the&#xD;
.     family. The same protest against the follies and falsities -of soci-&#xD;
ety,; the same plea for charity towards human -frailties ; the same&#xD;
lash for cant and excess; the same plucking off of' the disguises&#xD;
of pseudo-philanthropy ; the same check-rlein on too ardent hopes,&#xD;
we observe in all the volumes. But we seem to find a finer feli-&#xD;
city of phrase, a richer freight of thought, a more careful schol-&#xD;
arship in "'Fun and Earnest,"' than in the ''Musings," or the&#xD;
''Fancies."&#xD;
The imaginary conversations of Walter Savage Landor are un.-&#xD;
approachable in the serious line ; but we never saw anything so&#xD;
good in thie comic way as our author's classical dialogues, and&#xD;
Athenian and Roman billet-doux! Among all his various papers,&#xD;
we select from the three volumes all of a classical sort, as of the&#xD;
first order of excellence in their kind, and sincerely wish the au-&#xD;
thor had given us one volume exclusively of this matter.&#xD;

OPINIONS OF THE ,PRESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
It surprises us that it did not occur to the writer to make and&#xD;
entitle his last volumes CC Two Thousand Years Ago and to Come,"&#xD;
for he clearly has a decided penchant for keeping at about that&#xD;
distance on either side of the present, in his satires on the life of&#xD;
the nineteenth century. This would have given a missing unity&#xD;
to his volume.&#xD;
With all our abatements, we shall not have conveyed our real&#xD;
mind or purpose in this notice, if our readers are not curious to&#xD;
see "Fun and Earnest" and its older brothers. We promise them&#xD;
no common banquet. Whatever faults these works have, they&#xD;
are "alive and kicking ;" they excite strong feelings; they do not&#xD;
make us laugh, but they make us think and admire; they may&#xD;
bring the broadest grins from faces differently constituted from&#xD;
ours; and they cannot fail to amuse, instruct, and reward all&#xD;
their readers.-N. Y. Christiam Imquirer..&#xD;

FUN AND EARNEST.-Th~5 is the good title of a good b6ok, re-&#xD;
cently published in New York, by John S. Taylor, and having no&#xD;
other mark of parentage save that it is by the author of Musings&#xD;
of an Invalid, Fancies of a Whimsical Man, etc.&#xD;
Fun and Earnest is full of vigorous and most original thinking,&#xD;
and the reader has no difficulty in determ4iing when the writer&#xD;
is in earnest, or when the playful humor of his satiric and versa-&#xD;
tile pen deals with the comic muse. The Boston Letter,&#xD;
for insLnce, beginning at page 88, must be regarded as a spe-&#xD;
cimen ~f chaste and elevated writing, that would do no discredit&#xD;
to the clear and lofty mind of Edmund Burke, or even to the&#xD;
presupposed advancement of American taste and knowledge at&#xD;
the period at which our author has fictitiously assumed to be&#xD;
~writing. His ambition and aim are high ones, and we are disposed&#xD;
to predict that, ere he has exercised his strong and classic intel-&#xD;
lect a few years more, his productions will have earned all the&#xD;
fame his best friends can desire for them. Criticism cannot do&#xD;
