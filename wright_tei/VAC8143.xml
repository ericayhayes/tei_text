I am aware that the following story&#xD;
is one much unlike the popular novels&#xD;
~f the day-I have failed to follow out&#xD;
the estaV ed rules of novelists, and&#xD;
may, by so doing incur the displeasure&#xD;
if some of those who admire only the&#xD;
sensation tales of the "flash story pa-&#xD;
pers," now so popular. But, it has, at&#xD;
least, one merit, it contains more truth,&#xD;
than most stories of a similar character&#xD;
usually possess. The persons figuring&#xD;
in this humble tale are no ideal crea-&#xD;
tions. They have all "played their&#xD;
parts" in threat drama of Life, and&#xD;
seine of them are, even now, upon the&#xD;
"stage" of the World. With their per-&#xD;
mission, have Iwritten out this narrative&#xD;
~of actual events.&#xD;
I have given fictitious names to the&#xD;
&#xD;
different characters, and that is all. lb&#xD;
no other way have I deviated from the&#xD;
path of fact, and those who follow me&#xD;
through the narrative of Juliette Moore's&#xD;
trials, and triumphs, will be ready to&#xD;
echo, "Fact, is indeed, stranger than&#xD;
fiction."&#xD;
Perhaps some of my renders, those&#xD;
well versed in fashionable literature cx-&#xD;
peetmeto apologizeforprdsenting these&#xD;
pages to the world. I will simply reply&#xD;
in the language of another-Shelley-&#xD;
"The spirits that I have raised haunt&#xD;
m~ until they are sent to the devil of a&#xD;
printer. All authors are anxious to&#xD;
breech their bantlings."&#xD;

The sun was just~ sinking to his wes-&#xD;
tern home behind the hill tops of the&#xD;
little New England village of Tarrow-&#xD;
dale, when the old stage coach rattled&#xD;
up to the village Inn. It contained&#xD;
but two passengers, one a lady in deep&#xD;
mourning, who remained inside-her&#xD;
destination was, probably, the next vil-&#xD;
lage. The other, a gentleman, bearing&#xD;
with him every appearance of wealth&#xD;
and distinction. After. alighting from&#xD;
the coach, he sauntered leisurely up to&#xD;
the bar, and inquired of the pleasant&#xD;
faced landlord, the way to the cottag~&#xD;
of the widow Moore. The man eyed&#xD;
him narrowly for a moment before re-&#xD;
plying in the following way-&#xD;
"Wall, I guess you'll find the wider&#xD;
pr~tty~badly off-she's been aiIm these&#xD;
many months."&#xD;
"I did not inquire after the lady's&#xD;
health, but desire to be directed to her&#xD;
dwelling," haughtily replied the strang-&#xD;
57-&#xD;
"Wall, wall, you needn't get niad&#xD;
&#xD;
about it; nor put on au's; nor talk to&#xD;
me with your head so high in the air,.&#xD;
'cause I'm Joe Wiggins the Inn keeper&#xD;
-justice o! the peace-one of the big-&#xD;
gest men in Tarrowdale, and my father&#xD;
fit in the. Revolutionary war; I've often&#xD;
henred him tell how "&#xD;
"I do not care about hearing of your&#xD;
father's exploits at present, no doubt he&#xD;
was a very wonderful specimen of the&#xD;
human family. Mr. Wiggins will you&#xD;
have the kindness to direct me to the&#xD;
dwelling of Mrs.~Moore l"&#xD;
While the stranger spoke, the hard-&#xD;
settled look of haughtiness and gloom"...&#xD;
which usually rested upon his handsome&#xD;
features, broke away, and an aznused,&#xD;
almost cheerful look, took, for a time,&#xD;
its place.&#xD;
"Yas, yes," replied Mr. Wiggins, as&#xD;
he advanced towards the open door,&#xD;
"do ye see that ar little white cottage,&#xD;
over on the hill, wal if ye do, that's jist&#xD;
where the wider Moore has lived these&#xD;
six years, and a better; a.nicei~ woman.&#xD;
I never knew."&#xD;
"Thank you sir," was the rather cool&#xD;
rejoinder, and the elegantatranger step-&#xD;
ped from the piazza, and walked brisk-&#xD;
ly towards the white cottage on the&#xD;
hills&#xD;
Joe Wiggins stood in the door way&#xD;
looking after the gentleman, and as he&#xD;
shatled his eyes, with his sun burarted&#xD;

hands, ho said-&#xD;
"I wonder who that ar giotleman can&#xD;

taken a dislike to Miss Morriss. and did&#xD;
not sbowany disposition to weh~ome her&#xD;
visits and she confined her labors most-&#xD;
ly to the cabin of Ben. Here, evening&#xD;
after evening she would sit, and tell the&#xD;
inmate~ how happy and independent.&#xD;
the negroes were at the north, poison-&#xD;
ing their minds, and sowing the seeds&#xD;
of discontent and rebellion in their&#xD;
hearts. Martha, the wife of Ben, would&#xD;
pay little attention to the stories of this&#xD;
unprincipled woman, but her words&#xD;
muir deep into the young mulatto's&#xD;
heart. Long after she had left the&#xD;

that if he could but reach the north-.-'&#xD;
that land of freedom and of wealth, he&#xD;
could soon purchase his wife and child&#xD;
from slavery, and become a rich and in-&#xD;
dependent man. Martha tried to con-&#xD;
vince him that his impressions were&#xD;
erroneous, and without foundation, but&#xD;
it was of little use. One night after&#xD;
Miss Morrise had left the cabin, he told&#xD;
his wife that he had determined to run&#xD;
away-to fly to the uorLh, as~d in a few&#xD;

noon. No human power can compel&#xD;
me to do so. She has insulted me, ~he,&#xD;
apoor miserable dependent dared strike&#xD;
me, I'll not bear injustice from her, nor&#xD;
frQm you. Is this the way you fulfil!&#xD;
the solemn duty, my mother entrusted&#xD;
you to perform; remember, she can see&#xD;
from the Spirit land the injustice done&#xD;
her child."&#xD;
"Juliette I wish no outbursts of pas-&#xD;
sion; you must be tamed; your temper&#xD;
must be subdued, and I htwe chosen&#xD;
Miss Monies to accomplish the task..-.&#xD;
You shall apologize to her," he said in&#xD;
a sharp imperative tone.&#xD;
"Never! never!! and Miss Morriss&#xD;
shall not subdue me; she is a vile, de-&#xD;
signing woman. I can never learn to&#xD;
be good under her tuition; I will not&#xD;
live under the roof that shelters hex. I&#xD;
would rather share the cottage of the&#xD;
witch in the haunted grove, though it&#xD;
be ~he terror of the whole neighbor&#xD;
hood,"&#xD;
"You know net of what you speak.-.-&#xD;
You have never seen the witch of the&#xD;
grove, and if she should terrify you as&#xD;
she has all those who have seen her, I&#xD;
pray that you may ever be spared from&#xD;
meeting her. It sounds well, for a child&#xD;
like you, to threaten to leave the only&#xD;
home you have, because your temper&#xD;
*nd your pride rebel against making&#xD;
an apology to one you have most gross-&#xD;
ly insulted."&#xD;
"I have informed you, uncle George4&#xD;
of my determination. I am not a child&#xD;
at heart, though .1 may be so in years,"&#xD;
and Juliette passed from the apartment&#xD;
* with a haughty tread. Sheseemcdn'ore&#xD;
like a woman of twenty than a girl of&#xD;
fourteen. After leavingthe library she&#xD;
sought her own room. When she en-&#xD;

"Leave dis place! leave your Uncle!&#xD;
why war on artb you go to? you got&#xD;
no odder home but die," replied Cora&#xD;
in amazement.&#xD;
"1 am going to fly to the little cabin&#xD;
by the brook, there I will remain, for a&#xD;
time at least."&#xD;
"Gem to de cabin by de' brook? why&#xD;
missy de witch ob de grove, who lives&#xD;
near dar, will be sure to catch you and&#xD;
kill you."&#xD;
"No, no, Cora, t do not fear her, I&#xD;
have never harmed her, and Bhe will not&#xD;
molest me. While I remain concealed&#xD;
there you must bring me food, but if&#xD;
you love me, you will tell no one, ~vhere&#xD;
I have hidden myself."&#xD;
"What, not even mnssa X'7alter I" in.&#xD;
quired Cora.&#xD;
"No, no one must know where I am.&#xD;
I will return to the Hall if Miss Mor-&#xD;
ris's leaves; if she continues to remain,&#xD;
God only knows what will become of&#xD;
me, He will take care of me, and no&#xD;
harm will befall n.e while I trust Him."&#xD;
"Do blessed Savior will take care oh&#xD;
you jist youkcep on trusting Him, and&#xD;
you'll get along well enuff."&#xD;
"I shall leave to-night, after the plan-&#xD;
tation is still and all are asleep"&#xD;
"Ab, missy it is dreffuldon'tgo away,&#xD;

ebrated for its mildness and agreeable-&#xD;
ucs', without learning to love them and&#xD;
feeling a pang of sorrow when she con-&#xD;

wild creature.&#xD;
The day at length arrived, which was&#xD;
set for the departure of Effie Graham..&#xD;
Mi'. Moore was to accompany her home,.&#xD;
and at' the same time procure an insti uc-&#xD;

Efile took her leave and the traveling.&#xD;
carriage drove from the door bearing&#xD;
with it one loved by every living thing'&#xD;
upon the plantation.&#xD;
After her departure the house seemed'&#xD;
lonely and alimmat deserted Walter was&#xD;
home but little of the time, his 'studies&#xD;
occupied his time and attention. lanthe&#xD;
was absorbed in the pages of exciting&#xD;
end thriving novels, and Juliette was&#xD;
left almost to herself for amusement,&#xD;
and consequently an intimney sprung&#xD;
up between her and Clara Simons, to..&#xD;

to receive a long lecture on pfo~~e~iy&#xD;
