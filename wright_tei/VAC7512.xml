&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
Every remarkable spot has its legend,&#xD;
fraught with events that have trans-.&#xD;
pired on its premises. With some,&#xD;
the crumbling finger of time has erased&#xD;
the once legible marks which may&#xD;
have been chronicled of them ;--&#xD;
With others, oblivion has enshrouded&#xD;
all record of the soul-stirring scenes&#xD;
which have taken place, enveloped in&#xD;
mystery at the time ; and at the pres-&#xD;
ent, many are still veiled by the muta-&#xD;
tion of years that have passed.  .&#xD;
Fort Hill, however, within the lim-&#xD;
its of Auburn, is. too well known to&#xD;
the curious, and lovers of the antique&#xD;
in this region, to point out its locality.&#xD;
A part of the still visible rampart of&#xD;
some ancient place of defence which&#xD;
crowns its summit, and the area with-&#xD;
in the purlieu or earthy wall, denote&#xD;
that there is no fiction of its existence;&#xD;
and thatthe handswhich erected it, did&#xD;
it for defence in some war either among&#xD;
the aborigines, or progeny of human&#xD;
beings which once strode this region.&#xD;
Be that as it may, Fort Hill stands; the&#xD;
summit of which,. exhibits a visible&#xD;
site of past scenes of war, before which&#xD;
the curtain of time has hung for ages&#xD;
unexplained, Though altered now&#xD;
&#xD;
from its once wild and uneven aspect&#xD;
by the hand of civilization, and cori.&#xD;
vested into a city cemetry by the cit-&#xD;
izens of Auburn, and dotted arhong.its&#xD;
forest trees with beautiful marble&#xD;
grave-stones and monuments, where&#xD;
rest the departed of the city and sur-&#xD;
roundings, it presents the same sum-&#xD;
mit and appearance of the site of an&#xD;
ancient fort. Amid the monuments&#xD;
that tower among the gravest is one&#xD;
erected to the memory of "Logan" the&#xD;
friend of the white man ; who it was&#xD;
said was a Chief of the Cayugas, and&#xD;
may for aught we know, have figured&#xD;
as the conspicuous brave mentionedby&#xD;
the writer of this Tale, in the-perilbtts&#xD;
scenes experienced by the characters&#xD;
who form  the heroes introduced.-.i-&#xD;
That Logan was once the friend of the&#xD;
white man, history records a speech of&#xD;
his, bearing uncontestible evidence,&#xD;
which we quote asfollows:&#xD;
' Speech of Logan, a Mingo chief,&#xD;
to Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virgin-&#xD;
ia,-1774.&#xD;
" I appeal to any white man to&#xD;
say, if he ever entered Logan's cabin&#xD;
hungry, and he gave him no meat.; if&#xD;
ever he came cold and naked, and he&#xD;
clothed him not. During the course&#xD;
of the last long and bloody war, Loa-&#xD;

I&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
gan remained idle in his cabin, an ad-&#xD;
vocate for peace. Such was my love&#xD;
for the whites, that my contrymen&#xD;
pointed as they passed, and said:&#xD;
"Logan is the friend of the white&#xD;
man."&#xD;
. "I had even thought to have lived&#xD;
with you, but for the injuries of one&#xD;
man. Colonel Cresap, last spring, in&#xD;
cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered&#xD;
all the relations of Logan, not even&#xD;
sparing my women and children.-&#xD;
There runs not a drop of my blood in&#xD;
the veins of any living creature. This&#xD;
called on me for revenge. I have&#xD;
sought it : I have killed many : I have&#xD;
fully glutted my vengeance.&#xD;
"For.my country, I rejoice at the&#xD;
beams of peace ; but do not harbor a&#xD;
thought, that mine is the joy of fear.&#xD;
Logan never felt fear. He will not&#xD;
turn on his heel to save his life: Who&#xD;
is there to mourn for Logan?  Not&#xD;
one."&#xD;
On the monument erected on Fort&#xD;
Nill to the memory of this Chief is&#xD;
engraven the memorable words of the&#xD;
close of his touching appeal, "Who is&#xD;
there to mourn for Logan ?"&#xD;
From the summit of the site of&#xD;
this ancient place of defence, now, the&#xD;
eye rests in every direction upon the&#xD;
works of civilization: The dense&#xD;
forest which once surrounded it, has&#xD;
now almost vanished as it were from&#xD;
the country and where thick roots&#xD;
supporting the countless trees which&#xD;
overshadowed the earth, green fields&#xD;
are now presented to the eye ;-the&#xD;
morning sun which once shone upon&#xD;
the vast wild woods around it, now&#xD;
throws its rising beams upon the&#xD;
dwellings of civilization, and temples&#xD;
of worship to that God by whose prov-&#xD;
idence the rough places are made&#xD;
smooth. Though time, in a measure,&#xD;
rith its desolating hand his levelled&#xD;
&#xD;
the earthy battlements ; and majes-&#xD;
tic trees, towering high, now stand&#xD;
upon some parts of them, as sentinels,&#xD;
having braved the tempests of revolV'&#xD;
ing seasons, and grown from sprout to&#xD;
maturity ; they lead the mind back&#xD;
through the vista of years that are past,&#xD;
to dwell on scenes that have transpir-&#xD;
ed beneath their umbrageous branch-&#xD;
es.&#xD;
The early scenes of this region of&#xD;
country, when the brave and intrepid&#xD;
Sullivan passed through it, with his&#xD;
dauntless band of continental heroes,&#xD;
traversing its pathless wilds, opposed&#xD;
step by step, by the red men who ten-&#xD;
anted it, have been recounted by his-&#xD;
torians, contemporary with the era in&#xD;
which they were enacted ; and of the&#xD;
bloody track of his detachment of the&#xD;
revolutionary army through these&#xD;
once savage wilds, and the -privations&#xD;
and hardships they endured, records&#xD;
have been kept in memory by many&#xD;
of these actors, though the most of&#xD;
those actors have descended to the&#xD;
tomb.&#xD;
It was previous to Sullivan's expe-&#xD;
dition that the scenes of this present&#xD;
Tale transpired, to commence which,&#xD;
we must carry our readers back to the&#xD;
highest point of navigation  on the&#xD;
North River, to an occurrence in the&#xD;
early history of its settlement:-&#xD;
It was one afternoon in the month&#xD;
of September, that two Dutch settlers&#xD;
were standing on the bank of the Mlud-&#xD;
son, near a small cluster of rudehous-&#xD;
es.&#xD;
"See you that far-off sail, booming&#xD;
up the river ?" said one of them, Der-&#xD;
rick Van Hetter, to the other, his&#xD;
brother-in-law,Dan Van Valkenburgh,&#xD;
a stout, thick built youth, of about&#xD;
nineteen ; "there are guilders on board&#xD;
that craft," continued he, and he doub-&#xD;
led his finger and thumb in a circle,&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF FORT HILL.      _&#xD;
&#xD;
peeping through, to survey the vessel&#xD;
as she cut through the little billows.&#xD;
"Guilders, did you say, bub Het-&#xD;
ter ?" asked the youth.,&#xD;
"Yaw ; or there is on board what&#xD;
will be its equivalent in guilders," an-&#xD;
swered van. Hetter.&#xD;
"It may be so," responded Van&#xD;
Valkenburgh.&#xD;
"I know it-I know it," repeated&#xD;
Better, always positive, whether right&#xD;
or wrong. "What say you to that sail&#xD;
yonder, De Faun ?" continued he,&#xD;
turning to a rather gigantic figure, with&#xD;
a French look, that af"the moment'&#xD;
came up by their side.&#xD;
"What say I to that clipper, down&#xD;
by the bend of the river ?" answered&#xD;
De Faun.&#xD;
"Yaw-has she not the useful on&#xD;
board her ?" asked Derrick.&#xD;
"No---she's an American streeker,&#xD;
that comes and goes, and never lands,"&#xD;
replied he, "her skipper sleeps with&#xD;
one eye open-he knows the pirates&#xD;
of the ocean, besides the land pirates&#xD;
of these parts, as well as you, Derrick."&#xD;
"And what do I know ?" muttered&#xD;
Hitter, reddening up to his eyes.&#xD;
"Ye know enough to gain a gibbet&#xD;
yet, for your vile plunders of the craft&#xD;
that trade here," retorted De Faun.&#xD;
"Stop there, now," said the youth,"&#xD;
"no inuendoes against Derrick"-,&#xD;
"No, no," interrupted Derrick--&#xD;
"nor accuse me of plunder, when you&#xD;
are in alliance with all the natives be-&#xD;
tween the rivers,"&#xD;
"It's a lie-and he who says it shall&#xD;
eat his words, and sink or swim in the&#xD;
stream," loudly answered De . Faun,&#xD;
.whose countenance all at once swell-&#xD;
ed with rage while his eyes flashed&#xD;
like fire.&#xD;
"I may eat my own words ; but not&#xD;
swallow yours," said Hetter, drawing&#xD;
himself up, and pulling his old red cap&#xD;
more firmly on his head.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then take thatcheefrst,' Iid&#xD;
De Faun, raising his brawny a  rnand&#xD;
giving Derrick a blow which mighti&#xD;
have felled a bullock.&#xD;
"And here I spit it et you/'j angtily&#xD;
retorted Derrick, as he returned the&#xD;
salutation with his heavy fist full in&#xD;
the face of De Faun,&#xD;
"You'll swallow yet, or choke," re-&#xD;
plied De Faun, as he recovered from&#xD;
the blow of Derrick, and threw him-&#xD;
self forward, grasping him by the&#xD;
throat with a tenacity that soon eanush&#xD;
ed the naturally dark complexion of&#xD;
his antagonist to turn to a deeper hub,&#xD;
and his eyes and tongue to.start, while&#xD;
he gasped beneath the iron grip of&#xD;
his adversary.&#xD;
"Hold ! De Faun," ejaculated Yan&#xD;
Valkenburgh, on seeing them, "or by&#xD;
mine Got-! I'll tear that hand of youi.&#xD;
from its joint !"&#xD;
De Faun knew the hercflean&#xD;
strength of the youth' who addressed&#xD;
him, but his naturally fiery disposition&#xD;
was excited, and he still clasped .ha&#xD;
Better.&#xD;
"Will you let loose ?" vociferated&#xD;
the youth.&#xD;
"No," retorted De Faun.&#xD;
"Then you'll. not hold you'r pipe&#xD;
to-night with one hand," answered&#xD;
Van Valkenburgh, seizing the hiad&#xD;
that grasped the throatof his brother-&#xD;
in-law,and with a giant strength erug4&#xD;
ed the bones until he relaxed hishold;&#xD;
when Van Hetter, black and strvMgf,&#xD;
led, fell to the ground almost lifeless.&#xD;
;"See that, you knave," continue lhe&#xD;
youth, as with a tremendous etffrtihe&#xD;
hurled De Faun from him, twisting&#xD;
the limb he held in his grasp to the&#xD;
parting of the joint, when he Ie1;&#xD;
and De Faun found himself ;irk4.&#xD;
ately some eight or ten feet off. "Did&#xD;
I not tell you I'd disjoint it ?" he e.-&#xD;
solutely exclaimed.&#xD;

&#xD;
The gasping Van Hetter now slow-&#xD;
ly recovered as he-lay on the ground;.&#xD;
but could not speak ; while De Faun.&#xD;
writhing with pain from his dislocat-&#xD;
edlimb, and maddened to desperation&#xD;
rushed toward the settlement, appar-&#xD;
ently determined on revenge.&#xD;
As soon as Van Hetter had recov-&#xD;
eredsufficiently to articulate, he, ter-&#xD;
magant like, vented his strangulated&#xD;
throat with a torrent of epithets a-&#xD;
gainst De Faun. "Cursed pimp of-&#xD;
the river cruisers !" exclaimed he,&#xD;
"low, base informer, and hypocritical&#xD;
traitor to his neighbors ! Does hey&#xD;
think to stop a Van Hetter's trade ?-&#xD;
Here, Dan," continued he, raising&#xD;
himself up, and addressing Van Valk-&#xD;
enburgh, "hear me! 'that creeping&#xD;
slave -De Faun, shall die for this--I&#xD;
have sworn it."&#xD;
"No, Bub; take not that from any&#xD;
one which you can never return. Rec-&#xD;
ollect, blood for blood may be requir-&#xD;
ed of thee," mildly replied the youth.&#xD;
"De Faun must have his time."&#xD;
"It's short-it's short !" muttered'&#xD;
Derrick, reeling around, still weak&#xD;
from the-throttle of De Faun. "But&#xD;
look, 1)an ! look at the craft, she is:&#xD;
making for the landing."&#xD;
"She is, sure," replied the youth.&#xD;
"Can you see the guilders, Derrick ?"&#xD;
added he laughing at his brother-in-&#xD;
law;&#xD;
"I -ill see them." answered he, fix-&#xD;
ing his-eyes on the vessel as she cut&#xD;
her way up the river.,&#xD;
"Honest, I hope," said Dan.,,&#xD;
:"Yaw." ironically replied Derrick ;&#xD;
"ab it see! there comes that cursed pimp'&#xD;
De Faun, with four of his clan."&#xD;
"It is so," muttered the youth.-&#xD;
"Derrick, if they are for fight, "stand&#xD;
you still, and I will meet them."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER. It.&#xD;
Fearless young Van Valkenburgh&#xD;
stood, alternately eyeing the vessel&#xD;
and the approaching party. The long,&#xD;
low built, black hull of the craft was.&#xD;
co different from any he was in the&#xD;
habt of seeing, that he could not con-&#xD;
jecture what she was. His thoughts,&#xD;
however, of tiheP vessel were quickly&#xD;
directed into another channel as the&#xD;
five men neared him.&#xD;
Slowly De Faun andi ti four men&#xD;
came towards the bank, the former&#xD;
holding his maimed arm and hand&#xD;
with the other. At a short distance&#xD;
they all stopped and held an apparent&#xD;
consultation for some minutes. At&#xD;
length they moved again towards&#xD;
where Derrick and Dan were stand-&#xD;
idg. "You see they were two to one,"&#xD;
muttered De Faun to his followers.&#xD;
Dan walked a few steps forward to&#xD;
meet them, when De Faun, boiling&#xD;
with rage, and excited with the pain&#xD;
of his broken, dislocated limb, drew a&#xD;
long knife and rushed upon him; call-&#xD;
ing upon the others to come on.&#xD;
With a dexterous motion of his arm,&#xD;
the youth parried the blow aimed at&#xD;
at him by the enraged De Faun, and&#xD;
immediately grappled in with him,&#xD;
hurling him in an instant to the ground&#xD;
with a force that left him almost life-&#xD;
less. "Am I a mad dog;" said he,&#xD;
'that I should be attacked in thisway ?,&#xD;
The companions of De f'aun stop-&#xD;
ped a moment, and gazed upon the&#xD;
youth. His eyes were emitting the&#xD;
excited gleams of his indignant feel-&#xD;
ings, yet he stood over his prostrate&#xD;
foe without offering any other vio-&#xD;
lence. He stood upon his defence a-&#xD;
lone, and conscious of his. superior&#xD;
strength.&#xD;
De Faun stirred not now, for the&#xD;
force with which he had been hurled&#xD;
&#xD;
,_&#xD;

&#xD;
to the ground, had stunned him. Vat&#xD;
Better on seeing the struggle of Day&#xD;
with De Faun, with hasty stride&#xD;
moved to assist him, his blood heate&#xD;
with anger. "Hold! Van Hetter,'&#xD;
said the youth, "I am sufficient fo&#xD;
him, and his comrades are peaceable.'&#xD;
By this time the vessel had round.&#xD;
ed to at the landing ; and Vai.1 Hette]&#xD;
turning on his heel, left the spot, pro&#xD;
feeding towards her, and was soon&#xD;
followed by the rest, leaving De Faun&#xD;
laying upon the ground where Dan&#xD;
had hurled him.&#xD;
It was now for the first time; that&#xD;
Van Hetter discovered that the little&#xD;
vessel had port-holes, and that she&#xD;
was armed with cannon. She also&#xD;
was built different from the craft that&#xD;
occasionally stemmed the river so far&#xD;
up; and among a crowd of men who&#xD;
was on deck, they discovered one who&#xD;
wore the dress of a naval officer. No&#xD;
indications from the' vessel appearing&#xD;
to invite them on board, they stood&#xD;
looking at her until twilight faded a-&#xD;
way, and the evening sh des mantled&#xD;
surrounding objects in d rkness, when&#xD;
Van Hetter with the rest, slowly mov-&#xD;
ed ,towards their habitations. YGicder..&#xD;
ing what the object of the craft could&#xD;
be-.&#xD;
Early the next morning, the whole&#xD;
body of settlers were there, .,on the&#xD;
look out, to watch the motions of those&#xD;
who were on board the vessel ; on the&#xD;
afterpart of the deck of which they&#xD;
discovered a cluster gathered togeth-&#xD;
er, and among them, much to their&#xD;
surprise, they saw De Faun.&#xD;
"What means that ?"' asked V n&#xD;
Hetter of his brother-in-law.&#xD;
"I know not," replied he.&#xD;
Soon after a small boat cont ' ing&#xD;
ten or twelve persons, among  em a&#xD;
female, was seen to leave the vessel,&#xD;
and propelled by two sturdy oarsmen,1&#xD;
&#xD;
n moved up the river, following the sin-&#xD;
n uous course of the shore to avoid the&#xD;
s current, and was soon lost sight of.&#xD;
d   "That fellow De Faun, has fairly&#xD;
" bamboozled . you," said Dan to Van&#xD;

n and ere the day passed off, it was dis.&#xD;
covered by the settlers, that Van Het-&#xD;

t he absented himself.&#xD;
It will be recollected that De Faun,&#xD;
the day before, was left'laying on the&#xD;
ground. After they had gone, he rose&#xD;
t with some difficulty anfd made the&#xD;
best of his way to his rude dwelling,&#xD;
which stood embosomed a short dis-&#xD;
tance in the forest, back of the few&#xD;
houses that were located at the land-&#xD;
ing. No sooner, however, had night&#xD;
set in, than he proceeded to the spot&#xD;
where the vessel lay. As he approach-&#xD;
ed her, he was hailed from the deck,&#xD;
and after a few exchange of questions&#xD;
was permitted on board and ushered&#xD;
below ; and was seen the next morn'&#xD;
ing in conversation with the clustei'of&#xD;
men on the deck.&#xD;
Towards night the boat which had&#xD;
left the vessel was observed returning&#xD;
down the river, with De Faun and&#xD;
two others ; and soon after he landed,&#xD;
the vessel got underway, and ww(&#xD;
soon laying her course down the&#xD;
stream.&#xD;
Various were the conjectures of the&#xD;
few settlers on the shore, after the ves-&#xD;

their-curiosity was heighte/d more&#xD;

and dauntlessly pursuing his way up&#xD;

CHAPTER. III.&#xD;
Slowly now the party, each with a&#xD;
burning brand gleaming before him,&#xD;
moved along the side of the hill, while&#xD;
an occasional wild scream sounded a-&#xD;
bove, and the tramping of animals was&#xD;
heard as if leaving their coverts.&#xD;
"Blast these catamounts and bears ?"&#xD;
audibly exclaimed Bob Walker, one&#xD;
of the party, the old 'weather-beaten&#xD;
sailor with a wooden leg, as they ad-&#xD;
vanced a short distance-"I'd rather&#xD;
brave a real north-easter with a heavy&#xD;

"Hold, Walker," said the strong,&#xD;
athletic personage of the company,&#xD;
who carried the sword, and whom&#xD;
they called Bond-"you must look&#xD;
sharp, or the grapples of some of these&#xD;
wild inhabitants will fasten on you.&#xD;
They board one without any ceremo-&#xD;

"I know it" replied Walker ; "but,&#xD;
is it a .fact, Master Bond, that these'&#xD;
bears hug a man to death ?"&#xD;
He had scarce uttered the question,'&#xD;
when a sullen growl just above his&#xD;
head, saluted his ears, and the grating&#xD;
sounds of something sliding over the&#xD;
rough bark of a tree close by him, ar-&#xD;

"There is one of the gentlemen you&#xD;
was inquring about. Bob. You can&#xD;
shake hands with him if you choose,"&#xD;
said Bond to the old sailor.&#xD;
Walker immediately raised his blaz-&#xD;
ing faggot, and discovered a tolerable&#xD;
sized bear descending the tree. "Bet-&#xD;
ter keep. aloft, shipmate," said he,&#xD;
springing towards him and fearlessly&#xD;
fastening his hands in the long hair&#xD;
with which he was covered.&#xD;
The bear stopped an instant on be-&#xD;
ing taken hold of, and then *began&#xD;
slowly to ascend the tree, Walker&#xD;
holding on with all his strength, to&#xD;
pull him to the ground. Bruin how-&#xD;

holding on with both hands. After&#xD;

the ascending bear, drily muttered to&#xD;
himself, "Blast you, I had a short&#xD;

ing around. found he was alone.-&#xD;
Quickly picking up his fire-brand,&#xD;
which lay blazing on the ground, as&#xD;
he threw it down when he seized the&#xD;
bear, he hastened after the rest of the&#xD;
party, damning the "black devil's toe&#xD;
nails," he having received a slight&#xD;
scratch from one of the hind claws of&#xD;
the bear, while hanging on to him.&#xD;
As he overtook the rest, Bond burst&#xD;
into a laugh. "Why, Bob, your, friend&#xD;
in the tree seemed to want your com-,&#xD;
pany."&#xD;
"Yes, he scratched a slight acquaint-&#xD;

look here, Master Bond, he's no sail-&#xD;
or."&#xD;

"Where should I see one, chalky&#xD;
D'you spousee I was brought up in the&#xD;
woods ?"&#xD;
"Gosh ! no, Massa Bob, guess not,'&#xD;
replied Moses, with a continued broad&#xD;
grin.&#xD;
The party having now nearly reach&#xD;
ed thegop of the eminence, clamber&#xD;
ed over aimound of earth which of a&#xD;
sudden presented itself before them&#xD;
and seemed to extend in a circular&#xD;
form enclosing an area of several rods&#xD;
in diameter, Within this earthy wall&#xD;
or bulwark, stood several large trees,&#xD;
whose branches seemed locked and&#xD;
interwoven with each other, forming&#xD;
a kind of canopy, high above ; and the&#xD;
ground was covered with broken limbs&#xD;
and dry branches of them  and the&#xD;
thick forest around.&#xD;
On entering this area, the party&#xD;
clustered together ; the evening air&#xD;
surcharged with dampness, was begin-&#xD;
nin to cause a heavy-dew, which in&#xD;
distilling showers fell from the leaves,&#xD;
and branches-of the trees upon them.&#xD;
"There certainly have been scenes of&#xD;
war upon this spot," said the captain,&#xD;
addressing Allen.&#xD;
"It was evidently a place of de-&#xD;
fence," replied he. -&#xD;
"By whom was it erected ?"&#xD;
"The whites, I believe have never&#xD;
been satisfactorily informed. The&#xD;
marks of time stamp it at so remote a&#xD;
period, that no one pretends to date&#xD;
its erection. One thing alone is evi-&#xD;
dent now, that at stated periods the&#xD;
natives assemble here and take up a&#xD;
temporary residence; but from appear-&#xD;
ances, none have visited it for that pur-&#xD;
pose of late."&#xD;
The brief conversation of Allen and&#xD;
the captain, was here cut short by theJ&#xD;
&#xD;
r necessity of making preparations for&#xD;
e rendering themselves comfortable for&#xD;
a short time.&#xD;
?  All hands immediately were busy&#xD;
e in gathering something together for a&#xD;
fire, and in making some kind of tem-&#xD;
porary shelter for the night. The&#xD;
I light cloth tent of Ella, the female&#xD;
comprthion of the party, was raised,-&#xD;
- and a quantity of dry leaves collected&#xD;
- on one side for, a couch, and in a few&#xD;
minutes a large. blazing fire sent its&#xD;
gleams of light over the enclosure,&#xD;
which, together with the bright moon,&#xD;
illuminated the whole area around.&#xD;
Weary with travelling, Ella entered&#xD;
the tent which had been made as con-&#xD;
fortable for her as possible, and throw-&#xD;
'ing herself on the rude couch, soon&#xD;
was lost in sleep.&#xD;
Allen, after having seen that his&#xD;
charge was as well sheltered as the&#xD;
circumstances of the place would ad-&#xD;
mit, and partaken with the rest of the&#xD;
party some refreshments, wrapped&#xD;
himself in his thick over-coat and be-&#xD;
took him to rest.&#xD;
In the meantime the youthful com-&#xD;
panion, whom Walker called captain,&#xD;
retired at some' distance ; and was soon&#xD;
seen by Bond on the top of the wall,&#xD;
moving slowly along gazing upon the&#xD;
moon and countless stars which lit the'&#xD;
heavens.&#xD;
"Your shipmate seems to have ta-&#xD;
ken the first watch," said Bond, ad-&#xD;
dressing himself to Walker, laughing&#xD;
and pointing to the young man.&#xD;
"He lookingout forisqualls, massa&#xD;
Bob, aint he ?"-bsked  Moses with a&#xD;
knowing wink.a&#xD;
A withering frown from Walker,&#xD;
answered the black, and the words&#xD;
addressed to Bond, of "belay there,&#xD;
master Bond, say no more-you don't&#xD;
know him," immediately stopped the&#xD;
laughing of Bond.&#xD;

"I know it," replied Bob, seating&#xD;
himself; "but shove ahead, and never&#xD;

is righted from his upset."&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
The countenance of the old sailor&#xD;
for a moment as he sat alone assumed&#xD;
a rueful expression, at the mishap of&#xD;
his wooden leg; but brightened some-&#xD;
what at hearing tie cheerful sound of&#xD;
the captain's voice, who fortunately&#xD;
had received no injury from his fall&#xD;
from the tree. Seeing the situation of&#xD;
Walker, he rose, and smiling stepped&#xD;
towards him. "What! another splin-&#xD;
ter wound, Bob, ha !"-said he.&#xD;
"Not exactly, sir ; though I'm&#xD;
thinking it will want a little splinter-&#xD;
ing on the larboard side here," rephed&#xD;
Bob, still looking a little rueful at his&#xD;
shattered stump.&#xD;
"Just by way of a strengthening&#xD;
plaster, I suppose," interrupted Bond&#xD;
laughing at'the quizzical plight of the&#xD;
old sailor,&#xD;
"Just so, Master Bond." returned&#xD;
Walker. "Here, Nig," looking to-&#xD;
wards the black, "take your jack-knife&#xD;
and cut a small wood plaster for your&#xD;
shipmate's shin, and bind it on with&#xD;
this," pulling a ball of tarred twine out&#xD;
of his pocket. "I always keep spare&#xD;
rigging about me on the land or water,&#xD;
you see ; but there's no need of one's&#xD;
carrying extra spars about him in this&#xD;
wooden country-one has no difficul-&#xD;
ty in rigging, out jurymasts here-&#xD;
plenty at hand on deck in every direc-&#xD;

Moses, the black, soon cut a suita-&#xD;
ble sticlS from one of the fallen branch-&#xD;
es of the trees around them, and with&#xD;
skill adjusted the broken fragment of&#xD;
Walker's wooden limb, binding it on&#xD;

FORT HILL.&#xD;
Bond here asked Bob how he lost&#xD;
his leg originally.&#xD;
"Never mind that," replied he," it's&#xD;
r a long whilesago. This much I will&#xD;
tell you, it was not bit off."&#xD;
"Nor shot ?'&#xD;
"No,"&#xD;
r "Nor frozen ?"&#xD;
"'No. "                      .&#xD;
f "How then ?-.--Nor jammed off?"&#xD;
'"No."&#xD;
"It must have been cut off, then,"&#xD;
continued Bond, a littled vexed at the&#xD;
equivocal, ambiguous manner he wa&#xD;
getting so unimportant information.&#xD;
"No," replied Bob, it was not cut&#xD;
off."&#xD;
['Tore off, Massa Bond, answered&#xD;
the bliek, "splinter tore him off."&#xD;
1Yes, tore off ! You see chalky's&#xD;
told the truth," at length answered&#xD;
Bob, his countenance exhibiting an in-&#xD;
ward laugh, at the long, unsatisfied&#xD;
curiosity of Bond.&#xD;
"It's horrid thing, Massa Bond, to&#xD;
have limb tore right off one's body,"&#xD;
said the black.    -&#xD;
"Yes," spoke Bond in reply, drily,&#xD;
tho' still unsatisfied with the manner&#xD;
in which Walker lost his leg.&#xD;
"I helped him to cockpit for sur-&#xD;
geon ; and carried down young Mas-&#xD;
sa captain, soon arter," continued the&#xD;
black.&#xD;
"Who !" asked Bond:&#xD;
"Massa captain, who stands out&#xD;
there---he small midshipman at that&#xD;
time; but never fear fight or blood,&#xD;
no more than Massa Bob."&#xD;
"Belay there, Ioses, the haulyards&#xD;
of your tongue," exclaimed Walker.&#xD;
"If you have done a good turn to your&#xD;
shipmates, keep it to yourself, I say-&#xD;
they never will forget it."&#xD;
The words of Walker cut short the&#xD;
communicative conversation of the&#xD;
black at this time, and Bob stumped&#xD;
&#xD;
round to try the strength of Moses surgi-&#xD;
al operation on his wooden leg. "She is&#xD;
o3nd as solid oak again," said he, flourish-&#xD;
ing his timber leg around his colored com-&#xD;
panion's head,&#xD;
"IHem'm last a short voyage now, I&#xD;
guess," said the black, rising, and turning&#xD;
from the spot following after the captain,&#xD;
leaving Bond and Walker together.&#xD;
Bond now wished, yet hesitated, to ask&#xD;
Walker some more questions, as his curi-&#xD;
osity was raised to an unusual pitch.' At&#xD;
length after a few moments, he remarked,&#xD;
'Why Bob, you have seen some hard times&#xD;
in company with the young captain ?"&#xD;
"Yes, we've seen the rough as well as&#xD;
smooth" replied he.&#xD;
"An weathered many a storm, I should&#xD;
think." i id ond.&#xD;
"Aye sir, rejoined Walker, changing&#xD;
hia quid of tobacco for a fresh one: "But&#xD;
some how or other, you've a kind of en-&#xD;
quiring turn, Master Bond; just lay to a&#xD;
spell, and ask no more questions, will&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
Bond bit his lips at this quietus to his&#xD;
anticipated hopes of gratifying his curiosi-&#xD;
ty, merely answering, "I love to hear the&#xD;
long yarns of an old sailor, who has so-ma-&#xD;
ny scenes to recount."&#xD;
"No doubt, Master Bond, said Bob, "but&#xD;

In the mean time Allen, who had for the "I don't know much of them, Miss," re-&#xD;
most part of the day been off in the forest, plied Bond, "but trust we shall remain&#xD;
now came up, requesting them to attend quiet. If they come, however, Walker and&#xD;
the captain and himself in a few moments, myself will sell our lives as dearly as pos-&#xD;
as they were about leaving them on a short sible in your defence."&#xD;

on the result of the consultation, and the&#xD;
sight of what was shown him by the cap-&#xD;
tain, and stumped around almost in a per-&#xD;
feet ecstacy.&#xD;
It was not long after, before Allen, with&#xD;
the captain and the black, left the H ill,&#xD;
winding their way through the forest in a&#xD;
northerly direction. "A safe voyage and&#xD;
speedy return, captain," said. Walker, as her&#xD;
parted with them; and you, Nig," contin-&#xD;
ued he. addressing Moses, "keep your land&#xD;
tracks within hail oftyour shipmates, lest&#xD;
some Indian pirate run foul of you, and&#xD;
make carrion of hallof you for the crows."&#xD;
"Never you fear old nigger, Massa Bib,"&#xD;
replied the black, twistingithe hand of the&#xD;
old sailor in the vice-like grasp of his own&#xD;
-"Moses keep in the wake of the captain."&#xD;
Walker sat some time after they had&#xD;
gone near the entrance of the shelter of&#xD;
Ella, apparently in a deep study;-and&#xD;
Bond was humming an old tune of "woods&#xD;
and wilds," occasionally directing a word&#xD;
or two between the stanzas, to the girl in&#xD;
the tent.&#xD;
"So it seems we are to keep garrison,&#xD;
while our friends are absent," said Ella to&#xD;
Bond. "God grant that we may not b&#xD;
molested by the natives before their return,&#xD;

"Do !" cried Walker, his eyes brighten&#xD;
ing at the mention of fight or danger&#xD;
"Why, sweep the decks of them."&#xD;
Ella smiled at the animation of Bob&#xD;
and his fearlessness of danger, and mus&#xD;
ing on her unpleasant situation, remained&#xD;
silent, resolving to trust for the best, con&#xD;
scious that murmurs and repining would&#xD;
be of litle avail.&#xD;
The remainder of the day wore away&#xD;
heavily, but in the evening Walker recoun&#xD;
ted some sea-faring scenes, though not par-&#xD;
ticularly interesting to Ella; yet helped to&#xD;
beguile the time; and at a late hour she&#xD;
threw herself on her rude bed, while Bond&#xD;
and Walker alternately watched and kept&#xD;
a fire light, to prevent the interruption of&#xD;
the wild beasts, which they could distinct-&#xD;
ly hear after night fall, in the forest which&#xD;
stretched around in every direction,&#xD;
Though retired for the purpose, Ella&#xD;
could not sleep, fancy continually pictur-&#xD;
ing'to her a ruthless band of natives, ready&#xD;
to inflict any species of torture and savage&#xD;
cruelty, which, together with the wild&#xD;
howls issuing occasionally from the forest,&#xD;
drove sleep from her eyes. . She rose ear-,&#xD;
ly, harrassed with the frightful images her&#xD;
imagination had conjured up. The mor-&#xD;
ning was fine, and she ascended the high-&#xD;
est part of the earthen ridge, which cir-&#xD;
cumscribed this part of the mount. The&#xD;
faint, distant sound of running water could&#xD;
be heard 'n the stillness, and the sun like&#xD;
a globe of fire, appeared rising out of the&#xD;
dense forest in the far east.&#xD;
Continuing for some time casting her&#xD;
eyes around, she noticed that Bond and&#xD;
Walker were stirring, and heedlessly she&#xD;
descended the hill on the east side and&#xD;
entered a kind of partial opening which&#xD;
extended a short distance striking a part&#xD;
of the woods which was now thinly stud-&#xD;
ded with trees, and leisurely wandered far-&#xD;
theor on,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER V I&#xD;
There is something in the solitude of a&#xD;
forest which inspires the feeling with awe&#xD;
. -its silence, loneliness and dreary appear&#xD;
- ance, all are calculated to depress the mind,&#xD;
- The wilderness of trees on every hand,&#xD;
- that presented themselves before Ella,&#xD;
with their huge trunks that had braved&#xD;
the storms of ages, led her to contemplate&#xD;
upon nature's hand which planted them,&#xD;
- and she strayed unconsciously on, step af.&#xD;

tion what changes in the order of time&#xD;
might not take place ; when the present&#xD;
aspect of the country would be converted&#xD;
from a howling wilderness to seats of civil.&#xD;
ization, and to the busy hum of life and&#xD;
activity.&#xD;
Suddenly she came to the bank of the&#xD;
Owasco outlet, dashing and foaming along&#xD;
over the bottom of a deep vale, the steep&#xD;
sides of which it seemed almost impossible&#xD;
to descend. The wild scenery around ore.&#xD;
ated an awe in her mind, and her thoughts&#xD;
wandered in contrast to her native hills&#xD;
and streams, where civilization with its&#xD;
industry had erased the solitude of a des-&#xD;
ert, and caused their once wild aspect to&#xD;
assume such a difference to the one before&#xD;
her.&#xD;
She thought of her home, and the friends&#xD;
united to her by the ties of blood and na-,&#xD;
ture, until the tears flowed unconsciously&#xD;
from her eyes, while again the thoughts of&#xD;
her pecular situation, in the wilds of an&#xD;
almost trackless country, tennanted almost&#xD;
only by ravenous beasts and untutored na-&#xD;
tives, threw a melancholy gloom over her&#xD;
mind, as she contemplated the views pre-&#xD;
sented before her.&#xD;
At length, trembling with emotion, she&#xD;
sat herself on the high bank of the'rush.&#xD;
ing water that moved along in foam over&#xD;
fallen trees and drift wood of broken bran.&#xD;

he made his appearance, and all was&#xD;

Undoubtedly Bond threw himself&#xD;
forward to meet them, his eyes shi-t&#xD;
ning like meteors, while his ponder-&#xD;
ous broadsword was whirled in every&#xD;
direction. Aghast, the natives stop-&#xD;
ped and at once started back with&#xD;
awful yells, as they witnessed the de-&#xD;

the concentrated whirlwind could not&#xD;
sooner have cleared' the space where&#xD;
they stood than the tremendous sweeps&#xD;
of -his trusty blade, which at every&#xD;
stroke laid some one of them a head-&#xD;
less or a maimed trunk upon the&#xD;
earth.&#xD;
"Give it to them !" shouted Wal-&#xD;
ker, rushing forward on his wooden&#xD;
leg, wielding the stantion which sup-&#xD;
ported the tent of Ella, which he had&#xD;
seized with a giant strength as he&#xD;
started, and was Hercules like, stri-&#xD;
Iring down all before him. "Shiver&#xD;

tered Bond, wiping the large drops of&#xD;
perspiration from his forehead, as he&#xD;
surveyed the field of battle.&#xD;
"Wood devils incarnate !" respon-&#xD;
ded Walker, throwing his quid at one&#xD;
of the prostrate lifeless Indians before&#xD;
him, and turning the body  over with&#xD;
his wooden stump. "It was no boy's&#xD;

"Aye, Walker ; but there lays a&#xD;

touched him about the upper story,&#xD;
and broke his roof in."&#xD;
"No,--nor this one either,"' ans-&#xD;

of one of them, which at a single&#xD;

t bhtek nainei Moses, and the other a no-&#xD;
ile hearted -ailor. called by the ship's crew&#xD;
Bob Walker.   When first found. the chil-&#xD;
dren wore, receiving sustenance from the&#xD;
deis of the mother which she had perfo.&#xD;
rated in her fingers--thus, at the sacrifice,&#xD;
of her life:. renderinig up as her last resort.&#xD;
the vital current of her body for the pre&#xD;
servation of her offspring.&#xD;
This was discovered by the black, who&#xD;
afterwards was one who had charge of&#xD;
them until the arrival of the vessel in port.&#xD;
and during the remainder of the cruise.he&#xD;
and the sailors amused  themselves by&#xD;
feeding them occasionally in the same way,&#xD;
pricking their fingers and letting then&#xD;
draw their blood. A few days, however.&#xD;
after they were thus found, the cruiser en-&#xD;
tered port, and 'the, children were taken to&#xD;
the dwelling of the sailor, and there kept!&#xD;
at the expense of the offir of the vessel&#xD;

could be done and be legib'e.&#xD;
We will now go back to the time when&#xD;
the missing of the child took place, and&#xD;
enlighten our refers as it regards the rest&#xD;
of the persons mentioned in the preceed-&#xD;
ing pages:--&#xD;
Elbi Clifford, the female who- accompa-&#xD;
nied them, was the child of James Clif-&#xD;
ford, Who at a very early period embosom-&#xD;
ed himself in this region of country, be-&#xD;
fore the footsteps of civilization commen-&#xD;
ced to track the wild, uncultivated waste&#xD;
now checkered with cities and villa es.---&#xD;
Her mother died when she was an infant,&#xD;
left her motherless, and she was given to&#xD;
the aunt of the same name, who adopted&#xD;
her into their family, which consisted of&#xD;
herself and husband, and an only son,&#xD;
named Allen, about six or seven years of&#xD;
 age.&#xD;

Time in its course passed on ; and Ella&#xD;
Young George Smith, the name which Clifford reached her eighteenTh year; and&#xD;
this orphan lad was found to possess, in Allen, the only son of her foster parents,&#xD;
the meantime had lost his medal; which had some years previous arrived to man-&#xD;
to preserve the engraving upon it sacred, hood. He had connected himself with&#xD;
the black and the sailor, when they had some fur traders among the French and&#xD;
charge of the children, had filled up the Indians, and was occasionally absent for&#xD;
hollow part with rosin and pitch, and tied some time. He suddenly returned from&#xD;
them round their bodies. It was about one of his'exeursions through the Indian&#xD;
the time of his brother's being lost, that settlements with the joyful intelligence to&#xD;
young Smith missed his relic, and when he Ella that her father was still in existence.&#xD;
was taken on board the vessel, Walker, in In the deep wilderness near one of the&#xD;

upon the boy's breast, with his name rude- a hermit in a rude cabin. Allen had learnt&#xD;
&#xD;
tain, in the continental navy, returned to1&#xD;
port and heard the story of Allen. Bur.&#xD;
bing with a desire to learn the fate of his&#xD;
brother,'he determined to explore the vast&#xD;
forests of the west. and satisfy himself&#xD;
Ella Clifford 'conceived also the romantic&#xD;
notion of going with Allen and trying to&#xD;
bring her father back to the haunts of civ-&#xD;
ilization.&#xD;
Accordingly preparations were made by&#xD;
captain Smith for absence, and his cruiser'&#xD;
the Butterfly conveyed them through the&#xD;
Long-Island sound to Manhattan Island.&#xD;
where a stranger by the name of Bond,&#xD;
took passage,- to travel with them  to a&#xD;
French settlement on the shores of Lake&#xD;
Ontario.&#xD;
From this point commences our Tale,&#xD;
and wet now resume the scene of the dis-&#xD;
covery on Fort Hill.&#xD;
"It' mut be so," said captain Smith,&#xD;
"it mustbe the long lost brother of my in-&#xD;
fant years."&#xD;
"I know it," said Walker deliberately&#xD;
taking his jacknife and loosening the ros-&#xD;
in and pitch that filled the hollow of the'&#xD;
'medils. "Did I not tell you so ?" con-&#xD;
tinued he,-"George Smith on this, and&#xD;
Thomas Smith on the other, as near alike&#xD;
as the davies of the Butterfly, sir.''&#xD;
"Them the same, Mass' Captain-them&#xD;

his long missing brother.&#xD;
"I tell you what captain," said Walk&#xD;
er, "it was no want of good will' on my&#xD;
part, that I did not stave in the broadside&#xD;
of the young chap, your brother, when&#xD;
Bond and m'nyself boarded the whole con-&#xD;
voy of Indian pirates he was leading on to&#xD;
us; but I am right glad I only crippled&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"It was a fortunate escape," replied the&#xD;
captain.&#xD;
"He'm never seen day-light agin, Master&#xD;
Bob if you'd only had fair clip at dim.'-&#xD;
said Moses.&#xD;
"No, darkee ! it would have been all&#xD;
night, with him," returned Walker. "Its&#xD;
well, however he did not come within the&#xD;
sweep of Bolid."&#xD;
"Golly ! guess so !" replied the black.&#xD;
At this instant the tall, powerful native&#xD;
stepped forward supporting the disguised&#xD;
white man, who was no other than the De&#xD;
Faun mentioned at the commencement of&#xD;
our tale. "My children ! my boys !"1ex-&#xD;
claimed he, choked with emotion.&#xD;
"What ?" asked old Bob, "you come to&#xD;

region. The French, commandant&#xD;
had threatned an extermination of&#xD;
the Jive nations of nati s, and a grand&#xD;

just without the entrance, looking on&#xD;
the wild pastime of the savages, and&#xD;
making their remarks on them.&#xD;
The natives pursued their sport for&#xD;
some time, much to the amusement of&#xD;
Moses, who roared and laughed, as Le&#xD;
saw one after another of the Indians&#xD;

Walkersone of his wrestling theory.&#xD;
" Throwv him, yes; -I think so,"&#xD;
replied Walkers&#xD;
The natives observed the black in&#xD;
his gestulations, and one of them came&#xD;

seeming to court a struggle with him.&#xD;

CHAPTER    XV.&#xD;
The success of the black in thJrow-&#xD;
ing .the champion of the natives' in&#xD;
the sport they had commenced, arnd&#xD;
the exultation of Walker, maddened&#xD;
the savages, who alone had lingered&#xD;
behind;, to gratify their disappointed&#xD;
vengeance, at the unexpected rescue&#xD;
of their victims from their hands.-&#xD;
They had only waited for a favorable&#xD;
moment to again seize upon them for.&#xD;
sacrifice. The situation of the black&#xD;
at this time, therefore, caused them to&#xD;
rush upon him, and so sudden was&#xD;
the onset, that they had :nearly ac-&#xD;
complished their object before Moses&#xD;
could recover himself ; but in an in-&#xD;
stant he stretched,his body up and&#xD;
shook them  off.  Quickly -several&#xD;
more came up, and again they all&#xD;
pitched upon him.&#xD;
On seeing the attack upon the black,&#xD;
whose herculean strength seemed put&#xD;
forth in his own defence alone, Wal-&#xD;
ker could not contain himself, but&#xD;
loudly cheered him. At first, Moses&#xD;
suffered them to tumble him around&#xD;
without much resistance ; but when&#xD;
three &amp;amp;r four would take hold of each&#xD;
arm, and, bracing themselves, pull as&#xD;
if to wrench his joints asunder, the&#xD;
eyes of the black began to shoa the&#xD;
rising anger which they were gradu-&#xD;
ally arousing. So many had fastened&#xD;
themselves to his body and limbs that&#xD;
his utmost strength had to be put in&#xD;
requisition to keep them from bearing&#xD;
him to the ground. : Sumnoning,&#xD;
therefore, all his efforts, in one-grand&#xD;
display of muscular strength, he re-&#xD;
leased his nervous arms from the gripe&#xD;
&#xD;
In the meantime, old Clefford wit,&#xD;
messed the 'fury of the natues, ard&#xD;
trembled for the fate of his tugher.&#xD;
He rushed from the tent among'hi&#xD;
attempting to address thep; bvst fu&#xD;
voice was lost in the deafe~g grelis&#xD;
which they now franticaly teied;&#xD;
and in an agony of mind bordeiig ';on&#xD;
distraction, he returned pain to the&#xD;
tent where Ella was.&#xD;
She had fainted with terror, and 1a'&#xD;
motionless,-death's relentlis&#xD;
seemed to have stamped the sel &#xD;
release from all further earthly trials&#xD;
on her countenace, and the old pigi&#xD;
clasped, her inanimate ,fragile for in&#xD;
his arms.  "Spirit of heaven! saini-&#xD;

her to the open air.&#xD;

speed of race horses, determined to,&#xD;
seize the black.&#xD;
"Massa Bob, stick to. old'nigger&#xD;
while he fight f'em," said the black,&#xD;
seeing the Indians were bent on at-&#xD;
tacking him..&#xD;
"If they injure a curl of;your black&#xD;

.it," replied the old sailor, -throwing&#xD;
off his old tarpaulin hat and stepping&#xD;
in .front of the approaching savages4&#xD;
"Look here, ye infernals !" exclaimed&#xD;
he, "if you hurt Snowball, you hurt&#xD;

black bounded up to him, panting&#xD;
ftom exertion, with dilated nostrils&#xD;
and flashing eyes. "Nigger must&#xD;
fight, or die, 'MAssa Bob," exclaimed&#xD;
he, and he turned facing the reveng-&#xD;
ful natives.&#xD;
"Stop!" cried Walker, in a boat-i&#xD;
s'aim's voice, which sounded loud&#xD;
above the wild yells of the savages&#xD;
that now burst forth, echoing through&#xD;
the surrounding forest,--"Stop ! or,&#xD;

decide d, that'the next morning they would&#xD;
commence their journey.&#xD;
The 'French commander deeming Fort&#xD;

days. until be could make his arraugementa&#xD;
for an attack on the Indians, who were as-&#xD;
sembhing in the valley of the Onondaga,&#xD;
and finding the party were about starting&#xD;
for the Hudson, took the occasion of send&#xD;
ing a few select men with them as a kind&#xD;
of scouting party.&#xD;
La Villiam and six men were acordingly&#xD;
selected and notified to accompany the par-&#xD;
ty as far as was thought consistent, and&#xD;
make what discoveries they could of the&#xD;
movements of the Indians.- Nothing could&#xD;
have suited the French officer-more than&#xD;
this resolution of his commander, and he&#xD;
hastened to put himself in readiness, ani&#xD;
impart the intended acoompaniament to&#xD;
Ella and her father.&#xD;
On issuing from her tent, after, having&#xD;
made his communication, he met the twin&#xD;
brothers, whQ arm in arm, were walking,&#xD;
around, and with a haughty air, ironically&#xD;
informed them, that his commander, solic-&#xD;
itous for the safety of Miss Clefford and&#xD;
those of her party, had selected him 'as a&#xD;
kind of body guard to protect them' from&#xD;
the natives, on their rout to the sea board.&#xD;
The captain with a contemptuos smile&#xD;
heard him, and replied, that they should all&#xD;
feel themselves under infinite obligations&#xD;
to his commander for furnishing sch a&#xD;
formidable eseert, and added, that thoughh&#xD;
they were yithoUt fears. of 4anger, it was&#xD;
